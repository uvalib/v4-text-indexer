COMMENDATORY POEMS. TO Mr. ALLAN RAMSAY ON HIS Poetical Works. Hail Northern Bard! thou Fav'rite of the Nine, Bright, or as Horace did, or Virgil shine. In ev'ry Part of what thou'st done we find How they, and great Apollo too, have joyn'd To furnish thee with an uncommon Skill, And with Poetick Fire thy Bosom fill. Thy Morning Interview throughout is fraught With tuneful Numbers and Majestick Thought: And Celia, who her Lover's Suit disdain'd, Is by all-powerful Gold at length obtain'd. When Winter's hoary Aspect makes the Plains Unpleasant to the Nymphs, and jovial Swains; Sweetly thou do'st thy rural Couples call To Pleasures known within Edina's Wall. When, Allan, thou, for Reasons thou know'st best, Doom'd busy Cowper to eternal Rest: What Mortal could thine El'gy on him read, And not have sworn he was defunct indeed? Yet, that he might not lose accustom'd Dues, You rous'd him from the Grave to open Pews; Such Magick, worthy Allan, hath thy Muse. Th' experienc'd Bawd, in aptest Strains thou'st made Early instruct her Pupils in their Trade; Lest when their Faces wrinkled are with Age, They should not Cullies as when young engage. But on our Sex why art thou so severe, To wish for Pleasure we may pay so dear: Suppose that thou had'st after cheerful Juice, Met with a strolling Harlot wondrous spruce, And been by her prevail'd with to resort Where Claret might be drunk, or, if not, Port; Suppose, I say, that this thou granted had, And Freedom took with the enticing Jade; Would'st thou not hope some Artist might be found To cure, if ought you ail'd the smarting Wound? When of the Caledonian Garb you sing, (Which from Tartana's distant Clime you bring,) With how much Force you recommend the Plaid, To ev'ry jolly Swain, and lovely Maid. But if, as Fame reports, some of those Wights, Who canton'd are among the rugged Heights No Breeks put on, should'st thou not them advise, (Excuse me, Ramsay, if I am too nice) To take, as fitting 'tis, some speedy Care That what should hidden be appears not bare; Lest Damsels, yet unknowing, should by Chance, Their nimble Ogle t'wards the Object glance? If this thou dost, we, who the South Possess, May teach our Females how they ought to dress; But chiefly let them understand, 'tis meet They should their Legs hide more, if not their Feet, Too much by Help of Whale-bone now display'd, Ev'n from the Dutches to the Kitchen-maid; But with more Reason, those who give Distaste, When on their uncouth Limbs our Eyes we cast. Thy other Sonnets in each Stanza shew, What, when of Love you think, thy Muse can do. So movingly thou'st made the am'rous Swain, Wish on the Moor his Lass to meet again, That I, methinks, find an unusual Pain. Nor hast thou, chearful Bard, exprest less Skill, When the brisk Lass you sang of Peattie's-mill, Or Sussie, whom the Lad with yellow Hair Thou'st made in soft and pleasing Notes prefer To Nymphs less handsome, constant, gay and fair. In lovely Strains kind Nancy you address, And make fond Willie his coy Jean possess: Which done, thou'st blest the Lad in Nellie's Arms, Who long had absent been 'midst dire Alarms. And artfully you've plac'd within the Grove, Jammie to hear his Mistress own her Love. A gentle Care you've found for Strephon's Breast, By scornful Betty long depriv'd of Rest. And when the blisful Pairs you thus have crown'd, You'd have the Glass go merrily arround To shake off Care, and render Sleep more sound. Who e'er shall see, or hath already seen, Those bonny Lines call'd Christ's-kirk on the Green, Must own that thou hast, to thy lasting Praise, Deserv'd as well as Royal James the Bays. 'Mong other Things you've painted to the Life, A Sot unactive lying by his Wife, Which oft 'twixt wedded Folks makes wofull Strife. When 'gainst the scribling Knaves your Pen you drew, How didst thou lash the vile presumptuous Crew! Not much fam'd Butler, who had gone before, E'er ridicul'd his Knight, or Ralpho more; So well thou's done it, equal Smart they feel, As if thou'd pierc'd their Hearts with killing Steel. They thus subdu'd, you in pathetick Rhyme, A Subject undertook that's more sublime, By noble Thoughts, and Words discreetly join'd, Thou'st taught me how I may Contentment find. And when to Addie's Fame you touch'd the Lyre, Thou sang'st like one of the Seraphick Choir. So smoothly flow thy nat'ral rural Strains, So sweetly too, you've made the mournful Swains His Death lament, what mortal can forbear, Shedding like us upon his Tomb a Tear. Go on, fam'd Bard, thou Wonder of our Days, And crown thy Head with never-fading Bays. While grateful Britons do thy Lines revere, And value, as they ought, their Virgil here. J. Burchet. TO THE AUTHOR. As once I view'd a rural Scene, With Summer's Sweets profusely wild; Such Pleasure sooth'd my giddy Sense, I ravish'd stood, while Nature smil'd. Straight I resolv'd and chose a Field, Where all the Spring I might transfer; There stood the Trees in equal Rows, Here Flora's Pride in one Parterre. The Task was done, the Sweets were fled, Each Plant had lost its sprightly Air, As if they grudg'd to be confin'd, Or to their Will not matched were. The narrow Scene displeas'd my Mind, Which daily still more homely grew: At length I fled the loathed Sight, And hy'd me to the Fields anew. Here Nature wanton'd in her Prime; My Fancy rang'd the boundless Waste. Each different Sight pleas'd with Surprise, I welcom'd back the Pleasures past. Thus some who feel Apollo's Rage, Would teach their Muse her Dress and Time, Till hamper'd so with Rules of Art, They smother quite the vital Flame. They daily chime the same dull Tone, Their Muse no daring Sallies grace, But stifly held with Bit and Curb, Keeps heavy Trot, tho equal Pace. But who takes Nature for his Rule, Shall by her gen'rous Bounty shine; His easy Muse revells at Will, And strikes new Wonders every Line. Keep then, my Friend, your native Guide, Never distrust her plenteous Store, Ne'er less propitious will she prove Than now; but, if she can, still more. C. T. TO Mr. ALLAN RAMSAY. Too blindly partial to my native Tongue, Fond of the Smoothness of our English Song; At first thy Numbers did uncouth appear, And shock'd th'affected Niceness of the Ear. Thro' Prejudice's Eye each Page I see; Tho all were Beauties, none were so to me. Yet sham'd at last, whilst all thy Genius own, To have that Genius hid from me alone; Resolv'd to find, for Praise or Censure, cause, Whether to join with all, or all oppose; Careful I read thee o'er and o'er again: At length the useful Search requites my Pain; My false Distaste to instant Pleasure's turn'd, As much I envy as before I scorn'd: And thus the Error of my Pride to clear, I sign my honest Recantation here. C. Beckingham. TO Mr. ALLAN RAMSAY ON THE Publication of his Poems. Dear Allan, who that hears your Strains, Can grudge that you should wear the Bays, When 'tis so long since Scotia's Plains Could boast of such melodious Lays? What tho the Criticks, snarling Curs! Cry out, Your Pegasus wants Reins; Bid them provide themselves of Spurs; Such Riders need not fear their Brains. A Muse that's healthy, fair and sound, With noble Ardor fearless hastes O'er Hill and Dale; but Carpet-Ground Was ay for tender footed Beasts. E'en let the fustian Coxcombs chuse Their Carpet-Ground; but the green Field Was held a Walk for Virgil's Muse, And Virgil was an unco' Chield! Your Muse, upon her native Stock Subsisting, raises thence a Name; While they are forc'd to pick the Lock Of other Bards, and pilfer Fame. Oft when I read your joyous Lines, So full of pleasant Jests and Wit, So blyth and gay the Humor shines, It gives me many a merry Fit. Then when I hear of Maggy's Charms, And Roger tholing sair Disdain, The bonny Lass my Bosom warms, And mickle I bemoan the Swain. For who can hear the Lad complain, And not participate and feel His artless undissembled Pain, Unless he has a Heart of Steel. But Patie's Wiles and cunning Arts Appease th'imaginary Grief, Declare him well a Clown of Parts, And bring the wretched Wight Relief. More might be said; but in a Friend Encomiums seem but dull and flat, The Wise approve, but Fools commend, A Pope's Authority for that. Else certes 'twere in me unmeet, To grudge the Muse's utmost Force, Or spare in such a Cause my Feet, To clinch at least in Praise of yours. Ja. Arbuckle. THE Morning Interview. Such killing Looks, so thick the Arrows fly, That 'tis unsafe to be a Stander by: Poets approaching to describe the Fight, Are by their Wounds instructed how to write. Waller, 130. When silent Show'rs refresh the pregnant Soil, And tender Sallats eat with Tuscan Oil, Harmonious Musick gladens ev'ry Grove, While bleating Lambkins from their Parents rove, And o'er the Plain the anxious Mothers stray, Calling their tender Care with hoarser Bae. Now cheerful Zephyr from the Western Skies With easy Flight o'er painted Meadows flies, To kiss his Flora with a gentle Air, Who yields to his Embrace, and looks more fair. When from Debauch with sp'rituous Juice opprest, The Sons of Bacchus stagger home to Rest, With tatted Wigs, foul Shoes, and uncock'd Hats, And all bedaub'd with Snuff their loose Cravats. The Sun began to sip the morning Dew, As Damon from his restless Pillow flew. Him late from Celia's Cheek a Patch did wound, A Patch high seated on the blushing Round. His painful Thoughts all Night forbid him Rest, And he employ'd that Night as one opprest; Musing Revenge, and how to countermine The strongest Force, and ev'ry deep Design Of Patches, Fans, of Necklaces and Rings, Ev'n Musick's Pow'r, when Celia plays or sings. Fatigu'd with running Errands all the Day, Happy in want of Thought his Valet lay, Recruiting Strength with Sleep.—His Master calls, He starts with lock'd up Eyes, and beats the Walls. A second Thunder rouses up the Sot, He yawns and murmurs Curses through his Throat: Stockings awry, and Breeches-knees unlac'd, And Buttons do mistake their Holes for Haste. His Master raves,—cries, Roger, make Dispatch, Time flies apace. He frown'd, and lookt his Watch: Haste, do my Wig, ty't with the careless Knots, And run to Civet's, let him fill my Box. Go to my Laundress, see what makes her stay, And call a Coach and Barber in your Way. Thus Orders justle Orders in a Throng: Roger with laden Mem'ry trots along. His Errands done; with Brushes next he must Renew his Toil amidst perfuming Dust; The yielding Comb he leads with artful Care, Through crook'd Meanders of the flaxen Hair: E'er this perform'd he's almost chok'd to Death, The Air is thicken'd, and he pants for Breath. The Trav'ler thus in the Numidian Plains, A Conflict with the driving Sands sustains. Two Hours are past, and Damon is equipt, Pensive he stalks, and meditates the Fight: Arm'd Cap-a-pee, in Dress a killing Beau, Thrice view'd his Glass, and thrice resolv'd to go, Flusht full of Hope to overcome his Foe. His early Pray'rs were all to Paphos sent, That Jove's Sea-daughter would give her Consent: Cry'd, Send thy little Son unto my Aid. Then took his Hat, tript out, and no more said. What lofty Thoughts do sometimes push a Man Beyond the Verge of his own native Span! Keep low thy Thoughts, frail Clay, nor boast thy Pow'r; Fate will be Fate: And since there's nothing sure, Vex not thy self too much, but catch th'auspicious Hour. The tow'ring Lark had thrice his Mattins sung, And thrice were Bells for pious Service rung. In Plaids wrapt up, Prudes throng the sacred Dome, And leave the spacious Petticoat at Home: While softest Dreams seal'd up fair Celia's Eyes, She dreams of Damon, and forgets to rise. A sportive Sylph contrives the subtile Snare, Sylphs know the charming Baits which catch the Fair; She shews him handsome, brawny, rich and young, With Snuff-box, Cane, and Sword-knot finely hung, Well skill'd in Airs of Dangle, Toss and Rap, Those Graces which the tender Hearts entrap. Where Aulus oft makes Law for Justice pass, And charles's Statue stands in lasting Brass, Amidst a lofty Square which strikes the Sight, With spacious Fabricks of stupendous Hight; Whose sublime Roofs in Clouds advance so high, They seem the Watch-tow'rs of the nether Sky; Where once Alas! where once the Three Estates Of Scotland's Parliament held free Debates: Here Celia dwelt, and here did Damon move, Press'd by his rigid Fate, and raging Love. To her Apartment straight the daring Swain Approach'd, and softly knock'd, nor knock'd in vain. The Nymph new wak'd starts from the lazy Down, And rolls her gentle Limbs in Morning-Gown: But half-awake, she judges it must be Frankalia come to take her Morning Tea; Cries, Welcome, Cousin. But she soon began To change her Visage, when she saw a Man: Her unfixt Eyes with various Turnings range, And pale Surprise to modest Red exchange: Doubtful 'twixt Modesty and Love she stands, Then ask'd the bold Impertinent's Demands. Her Strokes are doubled, and the Youth now found His Pains increase, and open ev'ry Wound. Who can describe the Charms of loose Attire? Who can resist the Flames with which they fire? Ah, barbarous Maid! he cries, sure native Charms Are too too much: Why then such Store of Arms? Madam, I come, prompt by th'uneasy Pains, Caus'd by a Wound from you, and want Revenge; A borrow'd Pow'r was posted on a Charm: A Patch, damn'd Patch! Can Patches work such Harm? He said; then threw a Bomb, lay hid within Love's Mortar-piece, the Dimple of his Chin: It miss'd for once, she lifted up her Head, And blush'd a Smile, that almost stuck him dead, Then cunningly retir'd, but he pursu'd Near to the Toilet, where the War renew'd. Thus the great Fabius often gain'd the Day O'er Hannibal, by frequent giving Way: So warlike Bruce and Wallace sometimes deign'd To seem defeat, yet certain Conquest gain'd. Thus was he led in midst of Celia's Room, Speechless he stood, and waited for his Doom: Words were but vain, he scarce could use his Breath, As round he view'd the Implements of Death. Her dreadful Arms in careless Heaps were laid In gay Disorder round her tumbled Bed: He often to the soft Retreat would stare, Still wishing he might give the Battel there. Stunn'd with the Thought, his wand'ring Looks did stray To where lac'd Shoes and her silk Stockings lay, And Garters which are never seen by Day. His dazl'd Eyes almost deserted Light; No Man before had ever got the Sight, A Lady's Garters, Earth! their very Name, Tho yet unseen, sets all the Soul on Flame. The Royal Ned Edward III, King of England who established the most honourable Order of the Garter. knew well their mighty Charms, Else he'd ne'er hoop'd one round the English Arms. Let barb'rous Honours crown the Sword and Lance, Thou next their King does British Knights advance, O Garter! Honi soit qui mal y pense. O who can all these hidden Turns relate, That do attend on a rash Lover's Fate! In deep Distress the Youth turn'd up his Eyes, As if to ask Assistance from the Skies. The Petticoat was hanging on a Pin, Which the unlucky Swain star'd up within: His curious Eyes too daringly did rove, Around this oval conick Vault of Love: Himself alone can tell the Pain he found, While his wild Sight survey'd forbidden Ground. He view'd the ten-fold Fence, and gave a Grone, His trembling Limbs bespoke his Courage gone: Stupid and pale he stood, like Statue dumb, The amber Snuff dropt from his careless Thumb. Be silent here, my Muse, and shun a Plea May rise betwixt old Bickerstaff and me; For none may touch a Petticoat but he. Damon thus foil'd, breath'd with a dying Tone, Assist ye Powers of Love, else I am gone. The ardent Pray'r soon reach'd the Cyprian Grove, Heard and accepted by the Queen of Love. Fate was propitious too, her Son was by, Who 'midst his dread Artillery did ly Of Flanders Lace, and Straps of curious Dy. On India Muslin Shades the God did loll, His head reclin'd upon a tinsy Roll. The Mother Goddess thus her Son bespoke, “Thou must, my Boy, assume the Shape of Shock, “And leap to Celia's Lap; whence thou may slip “Thy Paw up to her Breast, and reach her Lip: “Strike deep thy Charms, thy pow'rful Art display, “To make young Damon Conqueror to Day. “Thou need not blush to change thy Shape, since Jove “Try'd most of brutal Forms to gain his Love; “Who that he might his loud [lovéd?] Saturnia gull, “For fair Europa's Sake inform'd a Bull. She spoke—Not quicker does the Lamp of Day Dart on the Mountain Tops a gilded Ray, Swifter than Lightning flies before the Clap, From Cyprus Isle he reach'd Celia's Lap: Now fawns, now wags his Tail, and licks her Arm; She hugs him to her Breast, nor dreads the Harm. So in Ascanius Shape, the God unseen Of old deceiv'd the Carthaginian Queen. So now the subtile Pow'r his Time espies, And threw two barbed Darts in Celia's Eyes: Many were broke before he cou'd succeed; But that of Gold flew whizzing through her Head: These were his last Reserve.—When others fail, Then the refulgent Metal must prevail. Pleasure produc'd by Money now appears, Coaches and Six run rattling in her Ears. O Liv'ry Men! Attendants! Houshold-plate! Court-posts and Visits! pompous Air and State! How can your Splendor easy Access find, And gently captivate the fair one's Mind? Success attends, Cupid has plaid his Part, And sunk the pow'rful Venom to her Heart. She cou'd no more, she's catched in the Snare, Sighing she fainted in her easy Chair. No more the sanguine Streams in Blushes glow, But to support the Heart all inward flow, Leaving the Cheek as cold and white as Snow. Thus Celia fell, or rather thus did rise: Thus Damon made, or else was made a Prize; For both were Conquerors, and both did yield, First she, now he, is Master of the Field. Now he resumes fresh Life, abandons Fear, Jumps to his Limbs, and does more gay appear. Not gaming Heir when his rich Parent dies, Not Zealot reading Hackney's Party-lies, Not soft Fifeteen on her Feet-washing Night, Not Poet when his Muse sublimes her Flight, Not an old Maid for some young Beauty's Fall, Not the long tending Stibler A Probationer. at his Call, Not Husband-man in Drought when Rain descends, Not Miss when Limberham A kind Keeper. his Purse extends, E'er knew such Raptures as this joyful Swain, When yielding, dying Celia calm'd his Pain. The rapid Joys now in such Torrents roul, That scarce his Organs can retain his Soul. Victor he's gen'rous, courts the Fair's Esteem, And takes a Bason fill'd with limpid Stream, Then from his Fingers form'd an artful Rain, Which rouz'd the dormant Spirits of her Brain, And made the purple Channels flow again. She lives, he sings; she smiles, and looks more tame: Now Peace and Friendship is the only Theme. The Muse owns freely here she does not know If Language pass'd between the Belle and Beau, Or if in Courtship such use Words It being alledged that the Eloquence of this Specie lies in the Elegance of Dress. or no. But sure it is there was a Parley beat, And mutual Love finisht the proud Debate. Then to complete the Peace and seal the Bliss, He for a Diamond Ring receiv'd a Kiss Of her soft Hand.—Next the aspiring Youth, With eager Transports press'd her glowing Mouth. So by Degrees the Eagles teach their Young To mount on high and stare upon the Sun. A sumptuous Entertainment crowns the War, And all rich Requisites are brought from far. The Table boasts its being from Japan, Th'ingenious Work of some great Artisan. China, where Potters coarsest Mould refine, That Rays through the transparent Vessels shine; The costly Plates and Dishes are from thence, And Amazonia A famous River in South America, whence we have our Sugar. must her Sweets dispence; To her warm Banks our Vessels cut the Main, For the sweet Product of her luscious Cane. Here Scotia does no costly Tribute bring, Only some Kettles full of Todian Spring. Tod's-Well, which supplies the City with Water. Where Indus and the double Ganges flow, On odorif'rous Plains the Leaves do grow, Chief of the Treat, a Plant the Boast of Fame, Sometimes call'd Green, Bohea's its greater Name. O happiest of Herbs! Who would not be Pythagoriz'd into the Form of thee, And with high Transports act the Part of Tea? Kisses on thee the haughty Belles bestow, While in thy Steams their coral Lips do glow; Thy Vertues and thy Flavour they commend, While Men, even Beaux, with parched Lips attend. EPILOGUE. The Curtain's drawn: Now gen'rous Reader say, Have ye not read worse Numbers in a Play? Sure here is Plot, Place, Character and Time, All smoothly wrought in good firm British Rhime. I own 'tis but a Sample of my Lays, Which asks the Civil Sanction of your Praise. Bestow't with Freedom, let your Praise be ample, And I my self will show you good Example. Keep up your Face, altho dull Criticks squint, And cry, with empty Nod, There's Nothing in't: They only mean there's Nothing they can use; Because they find most where there's most Refuse. ELEGY ON MAGGY JOHNSTON Maggy Johnston liv'd about a Mile Southward of Edinburgh, kept a little Farm, and had a particular Art of brewing a small Sort of Ale agreeable to the Taste, very white, clear and intoxicating, which made People who lov'd to have a good Pennyworth for their Money be her frequent Customers. And many others of every Station, sometimes for Diversion, thought it no Affront to be seen in her Barn or Yard., who died Anno 1711. Auld Reeky A Name the Country People give Edinburgh from the Cloud of Smoak or Reek that is always impending over it. mourn in Sable Hue, Let Fouth of Tears dreep like May Dew, To braw Tippony She sold the Scots Pint, which is near to two Quarts English, for Twopence. bid Adieu, Which we with Greed Bended as fast as she cou'd brew, But ah! she's dead. To tell the Truth now Maggy dang, He dings, or dang, is a Phrase which means to excel or get the better. Of Customers she had a Bang; For Lairds and Souters a' did gang To drink bedeen, The Barn and Yard was aft sae thrang, We took the Green. And there by Dizens we lay down, Syne sweetly ca'd the Healths arown, To bonny Lasses black or brown, As wel oo'd best; In Bumpers we dull Cares did drown, And took our Rest. When in our Poutch we fand some Clinks, And took a Turn o'er Bruntsfield-Links, Fields between Edinburgh and Maggy's, where the Citizens commonly play at the Gowff. Aften in Maggy's at Hy-jinks, A drunken Game, or new Project to drink and be rich; thus, the Quaff or Cup is fill'd to the Brim, then one of the Company takes a Pair of Dice, and after crying Hy-jinks, he throws them out: The Number he casts up points out the Person must drink, he who threw, beginning at himself Number One, and so round till the Number of the Person agree with that of the Dice, (which may fall upon himself if the Number be within Twelve;) then he sets the Dice to him, or bids him take them: He on whom they fall is obliged to drink, or pay a small Forfeiture in Money; then throws, and so on: But if he forget to cry Hy-jinks he pays a Forfeiture into the Bank. Now he on whom it falls to drink, if there be any Thing in Bank worth drawing, gets it all if he drinks. Then with a great Deal of Caution he empties his Cup, sweeps up the Money, and orders the Cup to be fill'd again, and then throws; for if he err in the Articles, he loses the Privilege of drawing the Money. The Articles are, (1) Drink, (2) Draw, (3) Fill, (4) Cry Hy-jinks, (5) Count just, (6) Chuse your doublet Man, viz. when two equal Numbers of the Dice is thrown, the Person whom you chuse must pay a Double of the common Forfeiture, and so must you when the Dice is in his Hand. A rare Project this, and no Bubble I can assure you; for a covetous Fellow may save Money, and get himself as drunk as he can desire in less than an Hour's Time. We guzl'd Scuds, Till we cou'd scarce wi hale out Drinks Cast aff our Duds. We drank and drew, and fill'd again, O wow but we were blyth and fain! When ony had their Count mistain, O it was nice, To hear us a' cry, Pike ye'r Bain Pike ye'r Bain. Is a Cant Phrase, when one leaves a little in the Cup, he is advised to pike his Bone, i.e. Drink it clean out. And spell ye'r Dice. Fou closs we us'd to drink and rant, Until we did baith glowre and gaunt, And pish and spew, and yesk and maunt, Right swash I true; Then of auld Stories we did cant Whan we were fou. Whan we were weary'd at the Gowff, Then Maggy Johnston's was our Howff; Now a' our Gamesters may sit dowff, Wi' Hearts like Lead, Death wi' his Rung rax'd her a Yowff, Reach'd her a Blow. And sae she died. Maun we be forc'd thy Skill to tine? For which we will right sair repine; Or hast thou left to Bairns of thine The pauky Knack Of brewing Ale amaist like Wine? That gar'd us crack. Sae brawly did a Pease-scon Toast Biz i' the Queff, and flie the Frost; Or fright the Frost or Coldness out of it. There we gat fou wi' little Cost, And muckle Speed, Now wae worth Death, our Sport's a' lost, Since Maggy's dead. Ae Simmer Night I was sae fou, The two following Stanzas are a true Narrative. On that slid Place where I 'maist brake my Bains, To be a Warning I set up twa Stains, That nane my venture there as I have done, Unless wi' frosted Nails he clink his Shoon. Amang the Riggs I geed to spew; Syne down on a green Bawk, I trow I took a Nap, And soucht a' Night Balillilow As sound's a Tap. And whan the Dawn begoud to glow, I hirsl'd up my dizzy Pow, Frae 'mang the Corn like Wirricow, Wi' Bains sae sair, And ken' nae mair than if a Ew How I came there. Some said it was the Pith of Broom That she stow'd in her Masking-loom, Which in our Heads rais'd sic a Foom, Or some wild Seed, Which aft the Chaping Stoup did toom, But fill'd our Head. But now since 'tis sae that we must Not in the best Ale put our Trust, But whan we're auld return to Dust, Without Remead, Why shou'd we tak it in Disgust That Maggy's dead. Of warldly Comforts she was rife, And liv'd a lang and hearty Life, Right free of Care, or Toil, or Strife, Till she was stale, And ken'd to be a kanny Wife At brewing Ale. Then farewell Maggy douce and fell, Of Brewers a' thou boor the Bell; Let a' thy Gossies yelp and yell, And without Feed, Guess whether ye're in Heaven or Hell, They're sure ye're dead. Epitaph. O Rare Maggy Johnston. ELEGY ON JOHN COWPER Kirk-Treasurer's Man 'Tis necessary for the Illustration of this Elegy to Strangers to let them a little into the History of the Kirk-Treasurer and his Man; The Treasurer is chosen every Year, a Citizen respected for Riches and Honesty; he is vested with an absolute Power to seise and imprison the Girls that are too impatient to have on their green Gown before it be hem'd; them he strictly examines, but no Liberty to be granted till a fair Account be given of these Persons they have obliged. It must be so: A List is frequently given sometimes of a Dozen or thereby of married or unmarried unfair Traders whom they secretly assisted in running their Goods, these his Lordship makes pay to some purpose according to their Ability, for the Use of the Poor: If the Lads be obstreperous, the Kirk-Sessions, and worst of all, the Stool of Repentance is threatned, a Punishment which few of any Spirit can bear. The Treasurer being changed every Year, never comes to be perfectly acquainted with the Affair; but their general Servant continuing for a long Time, is more expert at discovering such Persons, and the Places of their Resort, which makes him capable to do himself and Customers both a good or an ill Turn. John Cowper maintain'd this Post with Activity and good Success for several Years., ANNO 1714. I wairn ye a' to greet and drone, John Cowper's dead, Ohon! Ohon!

Altho he was nae Man of Weir, Yet mony a ane, wi quaking Fear, Durst scarce afore his Face appear, But hide their Head; The wylie Carl he gather'd Gear, And yet he's dead.

'Tis an ill Wind that dis na blaw Some Body good. Fy upon Death, he was to blame To whirle poor John to his lang Hame: But tho his Arse be cauld, yet Fame, Wi' Tout of Trumpet, Shall tell how Cowper's awfou Name Cou'd flie a Strumpet. He kend the Bawds and Louns fou well, And where they us'd to rant and reel, He paukily on them cou'd steal, And spoil their Sport; Aft did they wish the muckle De'll Might tak him for't. But ne'er a ane of them he spar'd, E'en tho there was a drunken Laird To draw his Sword, and make a Faird A Bustle like a Bully. In their Defence, John quietly put them in the Guard To learn mair Sense.

Shame faw ye'r Chandler Chafts, Lean or meager Cheeked, when the Bones appear like the Sides or Corners of a Candlestick, which in Scots we call a Chandler.

Ye Caledonian Beauties, who have long Been both the Muse, and Subject of my Song, Assist your Bard, who in harmonious Lays Designs the Glory of your Plaid to raise: How my fond Breast with blazing Ardour glows, When e'er my Song on you just Praise bestows. Phœbus, and his imaginary Nine, With me have lost the Title of Divine; To no such Shadows will I Homage pay, These to my real Muses shall give Way: My Muses, who on Smooth meand'ring Tweed, Stray through the Groves, or grace the Clover Mead; Or these who bath themselves where haughty Clyde Does roaring o'er his lofty Cat'racts ride; Or you who on the Banks of gentle Tay Drain from the Flowers the early Dews of May, To varnish on your Cheek the Crimson Dy, Or make the White the falling Snow outvy: And you who on Edina's Streets display Millions of matchless Beauties every Day; Inspir'd by you, what Poet can desire To warm his Genius at a brighter Fire? I sing the Plaid, and sing with all my Skill, Mount then O Fancy, Standard to my Will; Be strong each Thought, run soft each happy Line, That Gracefulness and Harmony may shine, Adapted to the beautiful Design. Great is the Subject, vast th'exalted Theme, And shall stand fair in endless Rolls of Fame. The Plaid's Antiquity comes first in View, Precedence to Antiquity is due: Antiquity contains a certain Spell, To make ev'n Things of little Worth excell; To smallest Subjects gives a glaring Dash, Protecting high born Idiots from the Lash: Much more 'tis valu'd, when with Merit plac'd, It graces Merit, and by Merit's grac'd. O first of Garbs! Garment of happy Fate! So long employ'd of such an antique Date; Look back some Thousand Years, till Records fail, And lose themselves in some Romantick Tale, We'll find our Godlike Fathers nobly scorn'd To be with any other Dress adorn'd; Before base foreign Fashions interwove, Which 'gainst their Int'rest and their Brav'ry strove. 'Twas they could boast their Freedom with proud Rome, And arm'd in Steel despise the Senate's Doom; Whil'st o'er the Globe their Eagle they display'd, And conquer'd Nations prostrate Homage paid, They only, they unconquer'd stood their Ground, And to the mighty Empire fixt the Bound. Our native Prince who then supply'd the Throne, In Plaid array'd magnificently shone: Nor seem'd his Purple, or his Ermine less, Tho cover'd by the Caledonian Dress. In this at Court the Thanes were gayly clad, With this the Shepherds and the Hinds were glad, In this the Warrior wrapt his brawny Arms, With this our beauteous Mothers vail'd their Charms; When ev'ry Youth, and every lovely Maid Deem'd it a Deshabille to want their Plaid. O Heav'ns! How chang'd? How little look their Race? When foreign Chains with foreign Modes take Place; When East and Western-Indies must combine To deck the Fop, and make the Gewgaw shine. Thus while the Grecian Troops in Persia lay, And learn'd the Habit to be soft and gay, By Luxury enerv'd, they lost the Day. I ask'd Varell, what Soldiers he thought best? And thus he answer'd to my plain Request; “Were I to lead Battalions out to War, “And hop'd to triumph in the Victor's Car, “To gain the loud Applause of worthy Fame, “And Columns rais'd to eternize my Name, “I'd choose, had I my Choice, that hardy Race “Who fearless can look Terrors in the Face; “Who midst the Snows the best of Limbs can fold “In Tartan Plaids, and smile at chilling Cold: “No useless Trash should pain my Soldier's Back, “Nor Canvass Tents make loaden Axles crack; “No rattling Silks I'd to my Standards bind, “But bright Tartana's waving in the Wind: “The Plaid alone should all my Ensigns be, “This Army from such Banners would not flie. “These, these were they, who naked taught the Way “To fight with Art, and boldly gain the Day. Ev'n great Gustavus stood himself amaz'd, While at their wond'rous Skill and Force he gaz'd. With such brave Troops one might o'er Europe run, Make out what Richlieu fram'd, and Lewis had begun. Degenerate Men! Now Ladies please to sit, That I the Plaid in all its Airs may hit, With all the Powers of Softness mixt with Wit. While scorching Titan tawns the Shepherd's Brow, And whistling Hinds sweat lagging at the Plow: The piercing Beams Brucina can defy, Not Sun-burnt she's, nor dazl'd is her Eye. Ugly's the Mask, the Fan's a trifling Toy To still at Church some Girl or restless Boy. Fixt to one Spot's the Pine and Myrtle Shades, But on each Motion wait th'Umbrellian Plaids, Repelling Dust when Winds disturb the Air, And give a Check to every ill bred Stare. Light as the Pinions of the airy Fry, Of Larks and Linnets who traverse the Sky, Is the Tartana spun so very fine, Its Weight can never make the Fair repine, By raising Ferments in her glowing Blood, Which cannot be escap'd within the Hood: Nor does it move beyond its proper Sphere, But let's the Gown in all its Shapes appear; Nor is the Straightness of her Waist deny'd To be by every ravisht Eye survey'd. For this the Hoop may stand at largest Bend, It comes not nigh, nor can its Weight offend. The Hood and Mantle make the tender faint; I'm pain'd to see them moving like a Tent. By Heather Jenny in her Blanket drest, The Hood and Mantle fully are exprest; Which round her Neck with Rags is firmly bound, While Heather Besoms loud she screams around. Was Goody Strode so great a Pattern, say? Are ye to follow when such lead the way? But know each Fair who shall this Sur-tout use, You're no more Scots, and cease to be my Muse. The smoothest Labours of the Persian Loom Lin'd in the Plaid, set off the Beauty's Bloom; Faint is the Gloss, nor come the Colours nigh, Tho white as Milk, or dipt in Scarlet Dy. The Lily pluckt by fair Pringella grieves, Whose whiter Hand outshines its snowy Leaves: No wonder then white Silks in our Esteem, Match'd with her fairer Face, they sully'd seem. If shining Red Campbella's Cheeks adorn, Our Fancies straight conceive the blushing Morn; Beneath whose Dawn the Sun of Beauty lies, Nor need we Light but from Campbella's Eyes. If lin'd with Green Stuarta's Plaid we view, Or thine Ramseia edg'd around with Blue; One shews the Spring when Nature is most kind, The other Heav'n, whose Spangles lift the Mind. A Garden Plot enrich'd with chosen Flowers, In Sun Beams basking after vernal Showers, Where lovely Pinks in sweet Confusion rise, And Amaranths and Eglintines surprise; Hedg'd round with fragrant Brier and Jessamine, The rosie Thorn and variegated Green; These give not half that Pleasure to the View, As when, Fergusia, Mortals gaze on you: You raise our Wonder, and our Love engage, Which makes us curse, and yet admire the Hedge; The Silk and Tartan Hedge, which does conspire With you to kindle Love's soft spreading Fire. How many Charms can every fair one boast! How oft's our Fancy in the Plenty lost! These more remote, these we admire the most. What's too familiar often we despise, But Rarity makes still the Value rise. If Sol himself shou'd shine through all the Day, We cloy, and lose the Pleasure of his Ray: But if behind some marly Cloud he steal, Nor for sometime his radiant Head reveal, With brighter Charms his Absence he repays, And every Sun Beam seems a double Blaze. So when the Fair their dazling Lustres shroud, And disappoint us with a Tartan Cloud, How fondly do we peep with wishful Eye, Transported when one lovely Charm we spy? Oft to our Cost, ah me! we often find The Power of Love strikes deep, tho he be blind; Perch'd on a Lip, a Cheek, a Chin, or Smile, Hits with Surprise, and throws young Hearts in Jail. From when the Cock proclaims the rising Day, And Milk-maids sing around sweet Curds and Whey; Till gray-ey'd Twilight, Harbinger of Night, Pursues o'er Silver Mountains Ochel Hills. sinking Light, I can unwearied from my Casements view The Plaid, with something still about it new. How are we pleas'd, when with a handsome Air We see Hepburna walk with easy Care? One Arm half circles round her slender Waist, The other like an Ivory Pillar plac'd, To hold her Plaid around her modest Face, Which saves her Blushes with the gayest Grace: If in white Kids her taper Fingers move, Or unconfin'd jet thro' the sable Glove. With what a pretty Action Keitha holds Her Plaid, and varies oft its airy Folds; How does that naked Space the Spirits move, Between the rufl'd Lawn and envious Glove? We by the Sample, tho no more be seen, Imagine all that's fair within the Skreen. Thus Belles in Plaids vail and display their Charms, The Love-sick Youth thus bright Humea warms, And with her graceful Meen her Rivals all alarms. The Plaid itself gives Pleasure to the Sight, To see how all its Setts imbibe the Light; Forming some Way, which even to me lies hid, White, Black, Blew, Yellow, Purple, Green and Red. Let Newton's Royal Club through Prisms stare, To view Celestial Dyes with curious Care, I'll please my self, nor shall my Sight ask Aid Of Cristal Gimcracks to survey the Plaid. How decent is the Plaid when in the Pew, It hides th'inchanting Fair from Ogler's View. The Mind's oft crowded with ill tim'd Desires, When Nymphs unvail'd approach the sacred Quires. Even Senators who guard the Common-weal, Their Minds may rove;—Are Mortals made of Steel? The finisht Beaux stand up in all their Airs, And search out Beauties more than mind their Prayers. The wainscot Forty Six's are perplext To be eclips'd, Spite makes them drop the Text. The younger gaze at each fine Thing they see; The Orator himself is scarcely free. Ye then who wou'd your Piety express, To sacred Domes ne'er come in naked Dress. The Power of Modesty shall still prevail; Then Scotian Virgins use your native Vail. Thus far young Cosmel read; then star'd and curst, And askt me very gravely how I durst Advance such Praises for a Thing despis'd? He smiling, swore I had been ill advis'd. To you, said I, perhaps this may seem true, And Numbers vast, nor Fools may side with you: As many shall my Sentiments approve; Tell me what's not the Butt of Scorn and Love? Were Mankind all agreed to think one Way, What wou'd Divines and Poets have to say? No Ensigns wou'd on Martial Fields be spread, And Corpus Juris never wou'd be read: We'd need no Councils, Parliaments, nor Kings, Ev'n Wit and Learning wou'd turn silly Things. You miss my Meaning still, I'm much afraid, I would not have them always wear the Plaid. Old Salem's Royal Sage, of Wits the Prime, Said, For each Thing there was a proper Time. Night's but Aurora's Plaid, that ta'en away, We lose the Pleasure of returning Day; Ev'n through the Gloom, when view'd in sparkling Skies, Orbs scarcely seen, yet gratify our Eyes: So through Hamilla's op'ned Plaid, we may Behold her heavenly Face, and heaving milky Way. Spanish Reserve, join'd with a Gallick Air, If manag'd well, becomes the Scotian Fair. Now you say well, said he; But when's the Time That they may drop the Plaid without a Crime? Then I, Lest, O fair Nymphs, ye should our Patience tire, And starch Reserve extinguish gen'rous Fire; Since Heaven your soft victorious Charms design'd To form a Smoothness on the rougher Mind: When from the bold and noble Toils of War, The rural Cares, or Labours of the Bar; From these hard Studies which are learn'd and grave, And some from dang'rous Riding o'er the Wave: The Caledonian manly Youth resort To their Edina, Love's great Mart and Port, And crowd her Theatres with all that Grace Which is peculiar to the Scotian Race; At Consort, Ball, or some Fair's Marriage-Day, O then with Freedom all that's sweet display. When Beauty's to be judged without a Vail, And not its Powers met out as by Retail, But Wholesale, all at once, to fill the Mind With Sentiments gay, soft, and frankly kind; Throw by the Plaid, and like the Lamp of Day, When there's no Cloud to intercept his Ray. So shine Maxella, nor their Censure fear, Who, Slaves to Vapours, dare not so appear. On Ida's Height, when to the Royal Swain, To know who should the Prize of Beauty gain, Jove sent his two fair Daughters and his Wife, That he might be the Judge to end the Strife: Hermes was Guide, they found him by a Tree, And thus they spake with Air divinely free, Say, Paris, which is fairest of us three. To Jove's high Queen, and the Celestial Maids, E're he wou'd pass his Sentence, cry'd, No Plaids. Quickly the Goddesses obey'd his Call, In simple Nature's Dress he view'd them all, Then to Cyth'rea gave the Golden Ball. Great Criticks hail! our Dread, whose Love or Hate, Can with a Frown, or Smile, give Verse its Fate; Attend, while o'er this Field my Fancy roams, I've somewhat more to say, and here it comes. When Virtue was a Crime, in Tancred's Reign, There was a noble Youth who wou'd not deign To own for Sovereign one a Slave to Vice, Or blot his Conscience at the highest Price; For which his Death's devis'd with hellish Art, To tear from his warm Breast his beating Heart. Fame told the tragick News to all the Fair, Whose num'rous Sighs and Groans bound through the Air: All mourn his Fate, Tears trickle from each Eye, Till his kind Sister threw the Woman by; She in his Stead a gen'rous Off'ring staid, And he, the Tyrant baulk'd, hid in her Plaid. So when Æneas with Achilles strove, Homer. The Goddess Mother hasted from above, Well seen in Fate, prompt by maternal Love, Wrapt him in Mist, and warded off the Blow That was design'd him by his valiant Foe. I of the Plaid could tell a hundred Tales, Then hear another, since that Strain prevails. The Tale no Records tell, it is so old, It happned in the easy Age of Gold, When am'rous Jove Chief of th'Olympian Gods, Pall'd with Saturnia, came to our Abodes, A Beauty-hunting; for in these soft Days, Nor Gods, nor Men delighted in a Chace That would destroy, not propagate their Race. Beneath a Fir-Tree in Glentanar's Groves, A large Wood in the North of Scotland. Where, e'er gay Fabricks rose, Swains sung their Loves, Iris lay sleeping in the open Air, A bright Tartana vail'd the lovely Fair; The wounded God beheld her matchless Charms, With earnest Eyes, and grasp'd her in his Arms. Soon he made known to her, with gaining Skill, His Dignity, and Import of his Will. Speak thy Desire, the Divine Monarch said. Make me a Goddess, cry'd the Scotian Maid, Nor let hard Fate bereave me of my Plaid. Be thon the Hand-maid to my mighty Queen, Said Jove, and to the World be often seen With the celestial Bow, and thus appear Clad with these radiant Colours as thy Wear. Now say my Muse, e're thou forsake the Field, What Profit does the Plaid to Scotia yield, Justly that claims our Love, Esteem and Boast, Which is produc'd within our native Coast. On our own Mountains grows the Golden Fleece, Richer than that which Jason brought to Greece: A beneficial Branch of Albion's Trade, And the first Parent of the Tartan Plaid. Our fair ingenious Ladies Hands prepare The equal Threeds, and give the Dyes with Care: Thousands of Artists sullen Hours decoy On rattling Looms, and view their Webs with Joy. May she be curst to starve in Frogland Fens, To wear a Fala A little square Cloath wore by the Dutch Women. ragg'd at both the Ends, Groan still beneath an antiquated Suit, And die a Maid at fifty five to boot; May she turn quaggy Fat, or crooked Dwarff, Be ridicul'd while primm'd up in her Scarff; May Spleen and Spite still keep her on the Fret, And live till she outlive her Beauty's Date; May all this fall, and more than I have said, Upon that Wench who disregards the Plaid. But with the Sun let ev'ry Joy arise, And from soft Slumbers lift her happy Eyes; May blooming Youth be fixt upon her Face, Till she has seen her fourth descending Race; Blest with a Mate with whom she can agree, And never want the finest of Bohea: May ne'er the Miser's Fears make her afraid, Who joins with me, with me admires the Plaid. Let bright Tartana's henceforth ever shine, And Caledonian Goddesses enshrine. Fair Judges to your Censure I submit, If you allow this Poem to have Wit, I'll look with Scorn upon these musty Fools, Who only move by old worm-eaten Rules. But with th'ingenious if my Labours take, I wish them ten Times better for their Sake; Who shall esteem this vain are in the wrong, I'll prove the Moral is prodigious strong: I hate to trifle, Men should act like Men, And for their Country only draw their Sword and Pen. SCOTS SONGS. The happy Lover's Reflections. The last Time I came o'er the Moor, I left my Love behind me; Ye Pow'rs! What Pain do I endure, When soft Idea's mind me: Soon as the ruddy Morn display'd The beaming Day ensuing, I met betimes my lovely Maid, In fit Retreats for wooing. Beneath the cooling Shade we lay, Gazing and chastly sporting; We kiss'd and promis'd Time away, 'Till Night spread her black Curtain. I pitied all beneath the Skies, Ev'n Kings, when she was nigh me; In Raptures I beheld her Eyes, Which could but ill deny me. Shou'd I be call'd where Cannons rore, Where mortal Steel may wound me, Or cast upon some foreign Shore, Where Dangers may surround me; Yet hopes again to see my Love, To feast on glowing Kisses, Shall make my Cares at Distance move, In Prospect of such Blisses. In all my Soul there's not one Place To let a Rival enter; Since she excells in ev'ry Grace, In her my Love shall center. Sooner the Seas shall cease to flow, Their Waves the Alps shall cover, On Greenland Ice shall Roses grow, Before I cease to love her. The next Time I go o'er the Moor She shall a Lover find me, And that my Faith is firm and pure, Tho I left her behind me: Then Hymen's sacred Bonds shall chain My Heart to her fair Bosom, There, while my Being does remain, My Love more fresh shall blossom. The Lass of Peattie's Mill. The Lass of Peattie's Mill, So bonny, blyth and gay, In spite of all my Skill, She stole my Heart away. When tedding of the Hay Bare-headed on the Green, Love 'midst her Locks did play, And wanton'd in her Een. Her Arms white, round and smooth, Breasts rising in their Dawn, To Age it wou'd give Youth, To press 'em with his Hand. Thro' all my Spirits ran An Extasy of Bliss, When I such Sweetness fand Wrapt in a balmy Kiss. Without the Help of Art, Like Flowers which Grace the Wild, She did her Sweets impart, When e'er she spoke or smil'd. Her Looks they were so mild, Free from affected Pride, She me to Love beguil'd; I wish'd her for my Bride. O had I all that Wealth Hopeton's high Mountains Thirty three Miles South west of Edinburgh, where the Right Honourable the Earl of Hopeton's Mines of Gold and Lead are. fill, Insur'd long Life and Health, And Pleasure at my Will; I'd promise and fulfill, That none but bonny She, The Lass of Peattie's Mill Shou'd share the same wi' me. DELIA. To the Tune of Green Sleeves. Ye watchful Guardians of the Fair, Who skiff on Wings of ambient Air, Of my dear Delia take a Care, And represent her Lover With all the Gayety of Youth, With Honour, Justice, Love and Truth, Till I return, her Passions sooth For me, in Whispers move her. Be careful, no base sordid Slave, With Soul sunk in a golden Grave, Who knows no Virtue but to save, With glaring Gold bewitch her. Tell her for me she was design'd, For me who know how to be kind, And have more Plenty in my Mind, Than one who's ten Times richer. Let all the World turn upside down, And Fools run an eternal Round, In Quest of what can ne'er be found, To please their vain Ambition. Let little Minds great Charms espy In Shadows which at Distance ly, Whose hop'd for Pleasure when come nigh, Prove nothing in Fruition. But cast into a Mold Divine, Fair Delia does with Lustre shine, Her virtuous Soul's an ample Mine, Which yeilds a constant Treasure. Let Poets in sublimest Lays, Imploy their Skill her Fame to raise; Let Sons of Musick pass whole Days, With well tun'd Reeds to please her. The Yellow-hair'd Laddie. In April when Primroses paint the sweet Plain, And Summer approaching rejoiceth the Swain, The Yellow-hair'd Laddie would oftentimes go To Wilds and deep Glens where the Hawthorn-trees grow. There under the Shade of an old sacred Thorn, With Freedom he sung his Loves, Ev'ning and Morn; He sang with so soft and inchanting a Sound, That Silvans and Fairies unseen danc'd around. The Shepherd thus sung, Tho young Maya be fair, Her Beauty is dash'd with a scornful proud Air; But Susie was handsome, and sweetly could sing, Her Breath like the Breezes perfum'd in the Spring. That Madie in all the gay Bloom of her Youth, Like the Moon was unconstant, and never spoke Truth; But Susie was faithful, good humour'd and free, And fair as the Goddess who sprung from the Sea. That Mamma's fine Daughter, with all her great Dowr, Was aukwardly airy, and frequently sowr: Then sighing, he wished, would Parents agree, The witty sweet Susie his Mistress might be. NANNYO. While some for Pleasure pawn their Health, 'Twixt Lais A famous Corinthian Courtizan. and the Bagnio, I'll save my self, and without Stealth, Kiss and caress my Nanny—O. She bids more fair t'ingage a Jove, Than Leda did or Danae Two Beauties to whom Jove made Love; to one in the Figure of a Swan, to the other in a Golden Shower.—O; Were I to paint the Queen of Love, None else shou'd sit but Nanny—O. How joyfully my Spirits rise, When dancing she moves finely—O, I guess what Heav'n is by her Eyes, Which sparkle so divinely O. Attend my Vow, ye Gods, while I Breath in the blest Britannio, None's Happiness I shall envy, As long's ye grant me Nanny—O. CHORUS. My bonny, bonny Nanny—O, My loving charming Nanny—O, I care not tho the world do know How dearly I love Nanny—O. BONNY JEAN. Love's Goddess in a Myrtle Grove Said, Cupid, bend thy Bow with Speed, Nor let the Shaft at Random rove, For Jeanie's haughty Heart must bleed. The smiling Boy, with divine Art, From Paphos shot an Arrow keen, Which flew unerring to the Heart, And kill'd the Pride of bonny Jean. No more the Nymph with haughty Air Refuses Willie's kind Address; Her yielding Blushes shew no Care, But too much Fondness to suppress. No more the Youth is sullen now, But looks the gayest on the Green, Whilst every Day he spies some new Surprising Charms in bonny Jean. A Thousand Transports crowd his Breast, He moves as light as fleeting Wind, His former Sorrows seem a Jest, Now when his Jeanie is turn'd kind: Riches he looks on with Disdain, The glorious Fields of War look mean, The chearful Hound and Horn give Pain, If absent from his bonny Jean. The Day he spends in am'rous Gaze, Which even in Summer shorten'd seems: When sunk in Downs with glad Amaze, He wonders at her in his Dreams. All Charms disclos'd, she looks more bright Than Troy's fair Prize, the Spartan Queen: With breaking Day he lifts his Sight, And pants to be with bonny Jean. The Kind Reception. To the Tune of Auld Lang Syne. Should auld Acquaintance be forgot, Tho they return with Scars? These are the noble Heroe's Lot, Obtain'd in glorious Wars: Welcome my Varo to my Breast, Thy Arms about me twine, And make me once again as blest, As I was lang syne. Methinks around us on each Bough, A Thousand Cupids play, Whilst thro' the Groves I walk with you, Each Object makes me gay. Since your Return the Sun and Moon With brighter Beams do shine, Streams murmur soft Notes while they run, As they did lang syne. Despise the Court and Din of State, Let that to their Share fall; Who can esteem such Slav'ry great, While bounded like a Ball? But sunk in Love, upon my Arms Let your brave Head recline, We'll please our selves with mutual Charms, As we did lang syne. O'er Moor and Dale with your gay Friend You may pursue the Chace; And after a blyth Bottle end All Cares in my Embrace: And in a vacant rainy Day You shall be wholly mine; We'll make the Hours run smooth away, And laugh at lang syne. The Heroe pleas'd with the sweet Air, And Signs of gen'rous Love, Which had been utter'd by the Fair, Bow'd to the Pow'rs above: Next Day with Consent and glad Haste Th'approach'd the sacred Shrine, Where the good Priest the Couple blest, And put them out of Pine. The PENITENT. To the Tune of the Lass of Livingston. Pain'd with her slighting Jamie's Love, Bell dropt a Tear,—Bell dropt a Tear, The Gods descended from above, Well pleas'd to hear,—Well pleas'd to hear. They heard the Praises of the Youth From her own Tongue,—From her own Tongue, Who now converted was to Truth, And thus she sung,—and thus she sung, Blest Days when our ingen'ous Sex, More frank and kind,—More frank and kind, Did not their lov'd Adorers vex, But spoke their Mind,—But spoke their Mind. Repenting now she promis'd fair, Wou'd he return,—Wou'd he return, She ne'er again wou'd give him Care, Or Cause to mourn,—Or Cause to mourn. Why lov'd I the deserving Swain, Yet still thought Shame,—Yet still thought Shame, When he my yielding Heart did gain, To own my Flame,—To own my Flame? Why took I Pleasure to torment, And seem too coy,—And seem too coy? Which makes me now, alas! lament My slighted Joy,—My slighted Joy. Ye Fair, while Beauty's in its Spring, Own your Desire,—Own your Desire; While Love's young Power with his soft Wing Fans up the Fire,—Fans up the Fire. O do not with a silly Pride, Or low Design,—Or low Design, Refuse to be a happy Bride, But answer plain,—But answer plain. Thus the fair Mourner wail'd her Crime, With flowing Eyes,—With flowing Eyes; Glad Jamie heard her all the Time, With sweet Surprise,—With sweet Surprise, Some God had led him to the Grove, His Mind unchang'd,—His Mind unchang'd, Flew to her Arms, and cry'd, My Love, I am reveng'd,—I am reveng'd! LOVE'S CURE. To the Tune of Peggy I must Love Thee. As from a Rock past all Relief, The Shipwreckt Colin spying His native Home, o'ercome with Grief, Half sunk in Waves and dying; With the next Morning Sun he spies A Ship, which gives unhop'd Surprise, New Life springs up, he lifts his Eyes With Joy, and waits her Motion. So when by her whom long I lov'd, I scorn'd was and deserted, Low with Despair my Spirits mov'd, To be for ever parted: Thus droopt I, till diviner Grace I found in Peggy's Mind and Face; Ingratitude appear'd then base, But Virtue more engaging. Then now since happily I've hit, I'll have no more delaying, Let Beauty yield to manly Wit, We lose our selves in staying; I'll haste dull Courtship to a Close, Since Marriage can my Fears oppose, Why should we happy Minutes lose, Since Peggy I must love thee? Men may be foolish, if they please, And deem't a Lover's Duty, To sigh, and sacrifice their Ease, Doating on a proud Beauty: Such was my Case for many a Year, Still Hope succeeding to my Fear. False Betty's Charms now disappear, Since Peggy's far outshine them. ODE. [Hence every Thing that can] Hence every Thing that can Disturb the Quiet of Man: Be blyth my Soul, In a full Bowl Drown thy Care. And repair The vital Stream: Since Life's a Dream. Let Wine abound, And Healths go round. We'll sleep more sound: And let the dull unthinking Mob pursue Each endless Wish, and still their Toll renew. Bessy Bell and Mary Gray. O Bessy Bell and Mary Gray They are twa bonny Lasses, They bigg'd a Bower on yon Burn-brae And theek'd it o'er wi' Rashes. Fair Bessy Bell I loo'd yestreen, And thought I ne'er cou'd alter; But Mary Gray's twa pawky Een, They gar my Fancy falter. Now Bessy's Hair's like a Lint Tap, She smiles like a May Morning, When Phœbus starts frae Thetis' Lap, The Hills with Rays adorning: White is her Neck, saft is her Hand, Her Waste and Feet's fow genty, With ilka Grace she can command, Her Lips, O wow! they're dainty. And Mary's Locks are like the Craw, Her Eye like Diamonds glances; She's ay sae clean, red-up and braw, She kills when e'er she dances: Blyth as a Kid, with Wit at Will, She blooming tight and tall is; And guides her Airs sae gracefou still, O Jove! she's like thy Pallas. Dear Bessy Bell and Mary Gray, Ye unco' sair oppress us, Our Fancies jee between you twae, Ye are sic bonny Lasses: Wae's me, for baith I canna get, To ane by Law we're stented; Then I'll draw Cuts and take my Fate, And be with ane contented. The Young LAIRD and Edinburgh KATY. Now wat ye wha I met Yestreen Coming down the Street, my Jo, My Mistress in her Tartan Screen, Fou bonny, braw and sweet, my Jo. My Dear, quoth I, Thanks to the Night That never wisht a Lover ill; Since ye're out of your Mither's Sight, Let's take a Wauk up to the Hill. The Castle-hill, where young People frequently take the Air on an Evening. O Katy wiltu gang wi' me, And leave the dinsom Town a while, The Blossom's sprouting frae the Tree, And a' the Summer's gawn to smile; The Mavis, Nightingale and Lark, The bleeting Lambs and whistling Hynd, In ilka Dale, Green, Shaw and Park, Will nourish Health and glad ye'r Mind. Soon as the clear Goodman of Day Does bend his Morning Draught of Dew, We'll gae to some Burn-side and play, And gather Flowers to busk ye'r Brow. We'll pou the Daizies on the Green, The lucken Gowans frae the Bog; Between Hands now and then we'll lean, And sport upo' the Velvet Fog. There's up into a pleasant Glen, A wee Piece frae my Father's Tower, A canny, saft and flowry Den, Which circling Birks has form'd a Bower: When e'er the Sun grows high and warm, We'll to the cauller Shade remove, There will I lock thee in mine Arm, And love and kiss, and kiss and love. KATY'S ANSWER. My Mither's ay glowran o'er me, Tho she did the same before me, I canna get Leave To look to my Loove, Or else she'll be like to devour me. Right fain wad I take ye'r Offer, Sweet Sir, but I'll tine my Tocher, Then Sandy ye'll fret, And wyt ye'r poor Kate, When e'er ye keek in your toom Coffer. For tho my Father has Plenty Of Siller and Plenishing dainty, Yet he's unco sweer To twin wi' his Gear; And sae we had need to be tenty. Tutor my Parents wi' Caution, Be wylie in ilka Motion; Brag well o' ye'r Land, And there's my leal Hand, Win them, I'll be at your Devotion. EDINBURGH'S ADDRESS TO THE COUNTRY. NOVEMBER 1718. From me Edina, to the Brave and Fair, Health, Joy and Love, and Banishment of Care: Forasmuch as bare Fields and gurly Skies Make rural Scenes ungrateful to the Eyes; When Hyperborean Blasts confound the Plain, Driving, by Turns, light Snow and heavy Rain; Ye Swains and Nymphs, forsake the withered Grove, That no damp Colds may nip the Buds of Love; Since Winds and Tempests o'er the Mountains ride, Haste here where Choice of Pleasures do reside; Come to my Tow'rs, and leave th'unpleasant Scene, My cheerful Bosom shall your Warmth sustain, Screen'd in my Walls, you may bleak Winter shun, And, for a while, forget the distant Sun: My blazing Fires, bright Lamps, and sparkling Wine, As Summer Sun shall warm, like him shall shine. My witty Clubs of Minds that move at large, With every Glass can some great Thought discharge; When from my Senate, and the Toils of Law, T'unbend the Mind from Bus'ness you withdraw, With such gay Friends to laugh some Hours away, My Winter Even shall ding the Summer's Day. My Schools of Law produce a manly Train Of fluent Orators, who Right maintain, Practis'd t'express themselves a graceful Way, An Eloquence shines forth in all they say. Some Raphael, Ruben, or Vandike admire, Whose Bosoms glow with such a Godlike Fire. Of my own Race I have, who shall ere long, Challenge a Place amongst the immortal Throng. Others in smoothest Numbers are profuse, And can in Mantuan Dactyl's lead the Muse: And others can with Musick make you gay, With sweetest Sounds Correlli's Art display, While they arround in softest Measures sing, Or beat melodious Solo's from the String. What Pleasure can exceed to know what's great, The Hinge of War, and winding Draughts of State? These and a Thousand Things th'aspiring Youth May learn, with Pleasure, from the Sages Mouth; While they full fraughted Judgments do unload, Relating to Affairs Home and Abroad. The generous Soul is fir'd with noble Flame, To emulate victorious Eugene's Fame, Who with fresh Glories decks th'Imperial Throne, Making the haughty Ott'man Empire grone. He'll learn when warlike Sweden and the Czar, The Danes and Prussians shall demit the War; T'observe what mighty Turns of Fate may spring From this new War rais'd by Iberia's King. Long ere the Morn from Eastern Seas arise, To sweep Night-shades from off the vaulted Skies, Oft Love or Law in Dream your Mind may toss, And push the sluggish Senses to their Posts; The Hautboys distant Notes shall then oppose Your phantom Cares, and lull you to Repose. To Visit and take Tea, the well dress'd Fair May pass the Crowd unruffled in her Chair; No Dust or Mire her shining Foot shall stain, Or on the horizontal Hoop give Pain. For Beaux and Belles no City can compare, Nor shew a Galaxy so made, so fair; The Ears are charm'd, and ravish'd are the Eyes, When at the Consort my fair Stars arise. What Poets of fictitious Beauties sing, Shall in bright Order fill the dazling Ring: From Venus, Pallas, and the Spouse of Jove, They'd gain the Prize, judg'd by the God of Love: Their Sun-burnt Features wou'd look dull, and fade, Compar'd with my sweet White and blushing Red. The Character of Beauties so Divine, The Muse for Want of Words cannot define. The panting Soul beholds with awful Love, Impress'd on Clay th'Angelick Forms above, Whose softest Smiles can pow'rfully impart Raptures sublime, in dumb Show, to the Heart. The Strength of all these Charms, if ye defy, My Court of Justice shall make you comply. Welcome, my Session, thou my Bosom warms, Thrice three Times welcome to thy Mother's Arms: Thy Father long, rude Man! has left my Bed, Thou'rt now my Guard, and Support of my Trade; My Heart yearns after thee with strong Desire, Thou dearest Image of thy ancient Sire: Should proud Augusta take thee from me too, So great a Loss would make Edina bow; I'd sink beneath a Weight I cou'd not bear, And in a Heap of Rubbish disappear. Vain are such Fears; I'll rear my Head in State, My bodding Heart foretells a glorious Fate: New stately Structures on new Streets shall rise, And new-built Churches tow'ring to the Skies. From utmost Thule to the Dover Rock, Britain's best Blood in Crowds to me shall flock; A num'rous Fleet shall be my Fortha's Pride, While they in her calm Roads at Anchor ride: These from each Coast shall bring what's Great and Rare, To animate the Brave, and please the Fair. Written beneath the Historical Print of the wonderful Preservation of Mr. David Bruce, and others his School-fellows, St. Andrews, August 19. 1710. Six Times the Day with Light and Hope arose, As oft the Night her Terrors did oppose, While toss'd on roring Waves the tender Crew Had nought but Death and Horror in their View: Pale Famine, Seas, bleak Cold at equal Strife, Conspiring all against their Bloom of Life: Whilst like the Lamp's last Flame, their trembling Souls Are on the Wing to leave their mortal Goals; And Death before them stands with frightful Stare, Their Spirits spent, and sunk down to despair. Behold th'indulgent providential Eye, With watchful Rays descending from on high; Angels come posting down the Divine Beam To save the Helpless in their last Extreme: Unseen the heav'nly Guard about them flock, Some rule the Winds, some lead them up the Rock, While other Two attend the dying Pair, To waft their young white Souls thro' Fields of Air. CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN, In Three CANTO'S. ???????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ??? ????,, ??? ?? ?? ????? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??.. ?. ??????. CANTO I. This Edition of the first Canto is taken from an old Manuscript Collection of Scots Poems written 150 Years ago, where it is found that James, the first of that Name, King of Scots, was the Author; thought to be wrote while that brave and learned Prince was unfortunately kept Prisoner in England by Henry VI. about the Year 1412. Ballenden in his Translation of H. Boece's History, gives this Character of him, He was weil lernit to fecht with the Swerd, to iust, to turnay, to worsyl, to syng and dance, was an expert Medicinar, richt crafty in playing baith of Lute and Harp, and sindry othir Instrumentis of Musik. He was expert in Gramer, Oratry and Poetry, and maid sae flowand and sententious Versis, apperit weil he was ane natural and borne Poete, lib. 16. cap. 16. Was ne'er in Scotland heard or seen Sic Dancing and Deray; Nowther at Fakland In the Shire of Fife where our Kings for some Time had their Residence. on the Green, Nor Peebles at the Play, Peebles one of our Royal Burroughs where the Gentlemen of the Shire frequently meet for the Diversion of Horse-Races and the like. As was of Woers, as I ween, At Christ's Kirk The Place where our Wedding held is either at Lesly (the Church there bearing that Name) or a Place so named a little distant from Windsor where our King was the Time of his Confinement. on a Day; There came our Kitties washen clean, In new Kirtles of Gray, Fou gay that Day. To dance these Damesels them dight, Made themselves ready. Thir Lasses light of Laits, Light or wanton in their Manners. Their Gloves were of the Raffel right, Their Shoon were of the Straits, Their Kirtles were of Lincome light, Stuff made at Lincoln. Well prest with mony Plaits, They were so nice when Men them nicht, They squeel'd like ony Gaits Fou loud that Day. Of all these Maidens mild as Mead, Was nane sae jimp as Gilly, As ony Rose her Rude was red, Her Lire was like the Lilly: Fou yellow, yellow was her Head, But she of Love was silly; Tho a' her Kin had sworn her dead, She wald have but sweet Willy Alane that Day. She scorned Jack, and scraped at him, And murgeon'd him Ridicul'd him, by a ludicrous manner of aping his Gate or Actions. with Mocks; He wad have loo'd, she wad na lat him, For a' his yellow Locks. He cherisht her, she bade gae chat him, She bid him go hang himself. Counted him not twa Clocks; Reckon'd him not worth a Couple of Beetles. Sae shamefully his short Gown set him, His Legs were like twa Rocks, Two Distaffs. This Description of Gilly's Love to Willy, and her despising Jack, notwithstanding his Affection to her, is drawn with an admirable comick Delicacy. Or Rungs that Day. Tam Lutter was their Minstrel meet, A Musician fit for them. Good Lord how he cou'd lance, He play'd sae shill, and sang sae sweet, While Tousie took a Trance; Auld Lightfoot there he did forleet, And counterfeited France: He forgot to play the good old Scots Tunes like Auld Lightfoot, and imitated the French, like our modern Minstrels, that dare play nought but Italiano's, for fear they spoil their Fiddles. He us'd himself as Man discreet, And up the Morice Dance He took that Day. Then Steen came steppand in with Stends, Nae Rink might him arrest: The swiftest Course could not stop him. Plaitfoot did bob with mony Bends, For Mause he made Request; He lap till he lay on his Lends, But risand was sae prest, While that he hostit at baith Ends, For honour of the Feast, And danc'd that Day. Syne Robin Roy began to revel, And Dawny to him rugged: Let be, quoth Jack, and cau'd him Jevel, And by the Tail him tugged; The Kensie cleekit to a Cavel, But Lord as they twa lugged; They parted manly on a Navel: Men say that Hair was rugged Between them twa. Ane bent a Bow, sic Sturt did steer him, Great Skaith was't to have scar'd him; He chesit a Flane He chose an Arrow. as did affear him, Th'other said, Dirdum, Dardum: A slighting manner of speaking. When one makes a Boast of some Action which we think but meanly of, we readily say, A Dirdum of that. Throw baith the Cheeks he thought to sheer him, Or throw the Arse have char'd him; B'ane Akerbraid it came na neer him, I canna tell what marr'd him Sae wide that Day. With that a Friend of his cry'd, Fy, And up an Arrow drew, He forged it sae furiously, The Bow in Flinders flew: Sae was the Will of God, trow I, For had the Tree been true, Men said, wha kend his Archery, That he had slain anew, Belyve that Day. A yap young Man that stood him neist, Loos'd aff a Shot with Ire, He etled the Bairn He design'd his Arrow at the Lad's Breast. in at the Breast, The Bolt flew o'er the Bire: He expresses his missing him, by a Metaphor of a Thunder-bolt flying over the Bire or Cow-house. Ane cry'd, Fy, he has slain a Priest, A Mile beyond a Mire; Then Bow and Bag frae him he kiest, And fled as fierce as Fire Frae Flint that Day. Ane hasty Hensure, called Hary, Wha was ane Archer, hynd Fit up a Tackle withoutten tarry, Immediately made ready his shooting Tackle. That Torment sae him tynd. His Vexation made him angry. I watna whither's Hand cou'd vary, Or the Man was his Friend; For he escap'd throw' Mights of Mary, As ane that nae ill mean'd, But Good that Day. Then Laurie like a Lion lap, And soon a Flane can fedder; Feathered an Arrow. He hecht to pierce him at the Pap, Thereon to wed a Wedder: He wagered a Wedder he would pierce him at the Pap. He hit him on the Wame a Wap, It bufft like ony Bladder; But sae his Fortune was and Hap, His Doublet made of Leather Sav'd him that Day. The Buff sae boisterously abaist him, He to the Earth dusht down; The tither Man for dead there left him, And fled out of the Town. The Wives came furth, and up they reft him, And fand Life in the Lown; Then with three Routs on's Arse they rais'd him, And cur'd him out of Sown, Frae Hand that Day. With Forks and Flails they lent great Slaps, And flang together like Frigs; With Bougers Rafters. of Barns they beft blew Caps, While they of Bairns made Brigs. The Rierd raise rudely with the Raps, When Rungs were laid on Riggs; The Wives came furth wi' Crys and Claps, See where my Liking liggs My Sweet-heart lies on the Ground. Fou low this Day! They girned and let Gird with Grains, Ilk Gossip other griev'd: Some strake with Stings, some gather'd Stains, Some fled and ill mischiev'd. The Minstrel wan within twa Wains, Got between two Wains or Wagons, and hid himself. That Day he wisely priev'd; For he came hame wi' unbruis'd Bains, Where Fighters were mischiev'd Fou ill that Day. Heich Hutchon with a Hisil Rice, To red can throw them rummil; He maw'd them down like ony Mice, He was na Baity Bummil: Or petty Fumbler; An actionless Fellow. Tho he was wight, he was na wise, With sic Jangleurs to jummil; For frae his Thumb they dang a Slice, While he cry'd, Barlafumil, Cry'd, Barley, or, A Parleyfumil, I'm fallen. I'm slain this Day. When that he saw his Blood sae red, To flee might nae Man let him; He ween'd it had been for auld Feed, He thought and bade have at him; He gart his feet defend his Head, The far fairer it set him, While he was past out of all Plead, He soud been swift that gat him, Throw Speed that Day. The Town Souter in Grief was bowden, Was furnisht with Abundance of Grief. One who has enough of any Thing, we say, He is well bodin. His Wife hang at his Waist, His Body was with Blood a browden, All besmear'd with Blood. But browden more commonly means forward or fond. He grain'd like ony Ghaist; Her glittering Hair that was so gowden, So hard in Love him lac'd, That for her Sake he was not yowden, Not tired. While he a Mile was chac'd, And mair that Day. The Miller was of manly Make, To meet him was nae Mows; There durst nae tensome there him take, Sae noyted he their Pows: The Bushment heal about him brake, And bickered him wi' Bows; Syne traitrously behind his Back, They hew'd him on the Howes, Threw him on his Back by striking on his Hows, i.e. Houghs. Behind that Day. Twa that were Headsmen of the Herd, On ither ran like Rams, They follow'd, seeming right unfear'd, Beat on with Barrow-Trams: But where their Gabs they were ungear'd, They gat upon the Gams; While bloody barkn'd was their Beards, As they had worried Lambs, Maist like that Day. The Wives keist up a hideous Yell, When all these Yonkiers yoked; As fierce as Flags of Fire-flaughts fell, Frieks Young Fellows. to the Fields they flocked: The Carles with Clubs did others quell On Breasts, while Blood out boaked; Gush'd out. Sae rudly rang the common Bell, That a' the Steeple rocked For Dread that Day. By this Tam Taylor was in's Gear, When that he heard the Bell, He said he should make all a steer, When he came there himsel: He gaed to fight in sic a Fear, While to the Ground he fell; A Wife that hat him on the Ear, With a great Knocking-mell, Fell'd him that Day. When they had bierd like baited Bulls, And Brain-wood Being distracted, or Brain-sick. brynt in Bails; They were as meek as any Mules; That mangit are with Mails; Wearied and gall'd with their Loading. For Faintness thae forfoughten Fools Fell down like flaughter'd Fails; Turf that the Country People flea for covering their Houses. Fresh Men came in, and hal'd the Dools, See Lucky Spence, Line 41. And dang them down in Dails, Bedeen In Heaps a great Deal of them. that Day. When a' was done, Dick with an Aix, Came furth to fell a Fiddir, Cut down a Fidder, or Load of Wood. Quoth he, Where are yon hangit Smaiks, That wad have slain my Brither? His wife bad him gae hame Gib Glaicks, And sae did Meg his Mither; He turn'd and gave them baith their Paiks, For he durst ding nae ither, But them that Day. CANTO II. The King having painted the rustick Squabble with an uncommon Spirit, in a most ludicrous Manner, in a Stanza of Verse the most difficult to keep the Sense complete, as he has done, without being forced to bring in Words for Crambo's sake, where they return so frequently: Ambitious to imitate so great an Original, I put a Stop to the War; called a Congress, and made them sign a Peace, that the World might have their Picture in the more agreeable Hours of Drinking, Dancing, and Singing. The following Canto's were wrote, one in 1715, the other in 1718, about 300 Years after the first. Let no worthy Poet despair of Immortality; good Sense will be always the same in spite of the Revolution of Words. But there had been mair Blood and Skaith, Sair Harship and great Spulie, And mony a ane had gotten his Death By this unsonsie Tooly: But that the bauld Good-wife of Braith Arm'd wi' a great Kail Gully, Came bellyflaught Came in great Haste, as it were flying full upon them with her Arms spread, as a Falcon with expanded Wings comes soussing upon her Prey., and loot an Aith, She'd gar them a' be hooly Fou fast Desist immediately. that Day. Blyth to win aff sae wi' hale Banes, Tho mony had clowr'd Pows; And dragl'd sae 'mang Muck and Stanes, They look'd like Wirry-kows: Quoth some, who 'maist had tint their Aynds, Let's see how a' Bowls rows: A Bowling-green Phrase, commonly used when People would examine any Affair that's a little ravel'd. And quat this Brulziement at anes, Yon Gully is nae Mows, Forsooth this Day. Quoth Hutchon Vide Canto 1. Line 121. He's brave, and the first Man for a honourable Peace., I am well content, I think we may do war; Till this Time Toumond I'se indent Our Claiths of Dirt will sa'r: Wi' Nevels I'm amaist fawn faint, My Chafts are dung a char; Then took his Bonnet to the Bent, And daddit aff the Glar, Fou clean that Day. Tam Taylor Vide Canto 1. Line 169. He's a Coward, but would appear valiant when he finds the rest in Peace., wha in Time of Battle Lay as gin some had fell'd him; Gat up now wi' an unco' Rattle, As nane there durst a quell'd him: Bauld Bess flew till him wi' a Brattle, And spite of his Teeth held him Closs by the Craig, and with her fatal Knife shored she would geld him, For Peace that Day. Syne a' wi' ae Consent shook Hands, As they stood in a Ring; Some red their Hair, some set their Bands, Some did their Sark Tails wring: Then for a Hap to shaw their Brands, They did there Minstrel bring, Where clever Houghs like Willi-wands, At ilka blythsome Spring Lap high that Day. Claud Peky was na very blate, He stood nae lang a dreigh; For by the Wame he gripped Kate, And gar'd her gi'e a Skreigh: Had aff, quoth she, ye filthy Slate, Ye stink o' Leeks, O figh! Let gae my Hands, I say, be quait; And wow gin she was skeigh, And mim that Day. Now settl'd Gossies sat, and keen Did for fresh Bickers birle; Contributed for fresh Bottles. While the young Swankies on the Green Took round a merry Tirle: Meg Wallet wi' her pinky Een, Gart Lawrie's Heart-strings dirle, And Fouk wad threep, that she did green For what wad gar her skirle And skreigh some Day. The manly Miller, haff and haff, Half fuddled. Came out to shaw good Will. Flang by his Mittens and his Staff, Cry'd, Gi'e me Paty's-Mill; He lap Bawk-hight So high as his Head could strike the Loft, or Joining of the Couples, and cry'd, Had aff, They rus'd him that had Skill; He wad do't better, quoth a Cawf, Had he another Gill Of Usquebae. Furth started neist a pensy Blade, And out a Maiden took, They said that he was Falkland bred, Been a Journey-man to the King's Taylor, and had seen Court-dancing. And danced by the Book; A souple Taylor to his Trade, And when their Hands he shook, Ga'e them what he got frae his Dad, Videlicet the Yuke, To claw that Day. Whan a' cry'd out he did sae weel, He Meg and Bess did call up; The Lasses bab'd about the Reel, Gar'd a' their Hurdies wallop, And swat like Pownies whan they speel Up Braes, or when they gallop, But a thrawn Knublock hit his Heel, And Wives had him to haul up, Haff fell'd that Day. But mony a pauky Look and Tale Gaed round whan Glowming hous'd them, Twilight brought them into the House. The Ostler Wife brought ben good Ale, And bade the Lasses rouze them; Up wi' them Lads, and I'se be Bail They'll loo ye an ye touze them: Quoth Gawssie, this will never fail Wi' them that this Gate woes them, On sic a Day. Syne Stools and Furms were drawn aside, And up raise Willy Dadle, A short Hought Man, but fou o' Pride, He said the Fidler play'd ill; Let's ha'e the Pipes, quoth he, beside; Quoth a', That is nae said ill; He fits the Floor syne wi' the Bride To Cuttymun and Treeladle, A Tune that goes very quick. Thick, thick that Day. In the mean Time in came the Laird, And by some Right did claim, To kiss and dance wi' Masie Aird, A dink and dortie Dame: But O poor Mause was aff her Guard, For back gate frae her Wame, Beckin she loot a fearfu' Raird, That gart her think great Shame, And blush that Day. Auld Steen led out Maggie Forsyth, He was her ain Good-brither; And ilka ane was unco' blyth, To see auld Fouk sae clever. Quoth Jock, wi' laughing like to rive, What think ye o' my Mither? Were my Dad dead, let me ne'er thrive But she wa'd get anither Goodman this Day. Tam Lutter had a muckle Dish, And betwisht ilka Tune, He laid his Lugs in't like a Fish, And suckt till it was done; His Bags were liquor'd to his Wish, His Face was like a Moon: Round, full and shining. When one is staring full of Drink, he's said to have a Face like a full Moon. But he cou'd get nae Place to pish In, but his ain twa Shoon, For Thrang that Day. The Latter-gae of haly Rhime, The Reader or Church Precenter, who lets go, i.e. Gives out the Tune to be sung by the rest of the Congregation. Sat up at the Boord-head, And a' he said was thought a Crime To contradict indeed: For in Clark-Lear he was right prime, And cou'd baith write and read, A Rarity in those Days. And drank sae firm till ne'er a Styme He cou'd keek on a Bead, Pray after the Roman Catholick Manner, which was the Religion then in Fashion. Or Book that Day. When he was strute, twa sturdy Chiels, Be's Oxter and be's Coller, Held up frae cowping o' the Creels From turning topsy turvy. The liquid Logic Scholar. When he came hame his Wife did reel, And rampage in her Choler, With that he brake the Spining-wheel, That cost a good Rix-dollar, And mair some say. Near Bed-time now ilk weary Wight Was gaunting for his Rest; For some were like to tyne their Sight, Wi' Sleep and Drinking strest. But ithers that were Stomach-tight, Cry'd out, It was nae best To leave a Supper that was dight, To Brownies Many whimsical Stories are handed down to us by old Women of these Brownies: They tell us they were a Kind of good drudging Spirits, who appeared in Shape of rough Men, would have lyen familiarly by the Fire all Night, threshen in the Barn, brought a Midwife at a Time, and done many such kind Offices. But none of them has been seen in Scotland since the Reformation, as saith wise John Brown., or a Ghaist, To eat or Day. On whomelt Tubs lay twa lang Dails, On them stood mony a Goan, Some fill'd wi' Brachan, some wi' Kail, And Milk het frae the Loan. Of Daintiths they had Routh and Wale, Of which they were right fon; But nathing wad gae down but Ale Wi' drunken Donald Don The Smith that Day. Twa Times aught Bannocks in a Heap, And twa good Junts of Beef, Wi' hind and fore Spaul of a Sheep, Drew Whitles frae ilk Sheath: Wi' Gravie a their Beards did dreep, They kempit with their Teeth; A Kebbuck syn that 'maist cou'd creep Its lane pat on the Sheaf, A Cheese full of crawling Mites crown'd the Feast. In Stous that Day. The Bride was now laid in her Bed, Her left Leg Ho was flung; The Practice of throwing the Bridegroom or the Bride's Stocking when they are going to Bed, is well known: The Person who it lights on is to be next married of the Company. And Geordie Gib was fidgen glad, Because it hit Jean Gun: She was his Jo, and aft had said, Fy, Geordie, had your Tongue, Ye's ne'er get me to be your Bride: But chang'd her Mind when bung, This very Day. Tehee An Interjection of Laughter., quoth Touzie, when she saw The Cathel coming ben, It pypin het gae'd round them a', The Bride she made a Fen, To sit in Wylicoat sae braw, Upon her nether En; Her Lad like ony Cock did craw, That meets a Clockin Hen, A hatching Hen. And blyth were they. The Souter, Miller, Smith and Dick, Lawrie and Hutchon bauld, Carles that keep nae very strict Be Hours, tho they were auld; Nor cou'd they e'er leave aff that Trick, But whare good Ale was sald, They drank a' Night, e'en tho auld Nick Shou'd tempt their Wives to scald Them for't neist Day. Was ne'er in Scotland heard or seen Sic Banqueting and Drinkin, Sic Revelling and Battles keen, Sic Dancing, and sic Jinkin, And unko Wark that fell at E'en, Whan Lasses were haff winkin, They lost their Feet and baith their Een, And Maidenheads gae'd linkin Aff a' that Day. CANTO III. Curious to know how my Bridal Folks would look next Day after the Marriage, I attempted this third Canto, which opens with a Description of the Morning. Then the Friends come and present their Gifts to the new married Couple. A View is taken of one Girl (Kirsh) who had come fairly off, and of Mause who had stumbled with the Laird. Next a new Scene of Drinking is represented, and the young Good-man is creel'd. Then the Character of the Smith's Ill-natured Shrew is drawn, which leads in the Description of riding the Stang. Next Magy Murdy has an exemplary Character of a good wise Wife. Deep drinking and bloodless Quarrels makes an end of an old Tale. Now frae East Nook of Fife Where Day must break upon my Company; if, as I have observed, the Scene is at Lesly Church. the Daw'n Speel'd Westlines up the Lift, Carles wha heard the Cock had craw'n, Begoud to rax and rift: And greedy Wives wi' girning Thrawn, Cry'd, Lasses up to Thrift; Dogs barked, and the Lads frae Hand Bang'd to their Breeks like Drift, Be Break of Day. But some wha had been fow Yestreen, Sic as the Latter-gae, Air up had nae will to be seen, Grudgin their Groat to pay. Payment of the drunken Groat is very peremptorily demanded by the common People next Morning; but if they frankly confess the Debt due, they are passed for Two-pence. But what aft fristed's no forgeen, When Fouk has nought to say; Yet sweer were they to rake their Een, Rub open their Eyes. Sic dizzy Heads had they, And het that Day. Be that Time it was fair foor Days, Broad Day Light. As fou's the House cou'd pang, To see the young Fouk or they raise, Gossips came in ding dang, And wi' a Soss aboon the Claiths, They commonly throw their Gifts of Houshold Furniture above the Bed-cloaths where the young Folks are lying. Ilk ane their Gifts down flang: Twall Toop Horn-spoons down Maggy lays, Baith muckle mow'd and lang, For Kale or Whey. Her Aunt a Pair of Tangs fush in, Right bauld she spake and spruce, Gin your Goodman shall make a Din, And gabble like a Goose, Shorin whan fou to skelp ye're Skin, Thir Tangs may be of Use; Lay them enlang his Pow or Shin, Wha wins syn may make Roose, Between you twa. Auld Bessie in her red Coat braw, Cam wi' her ain Oe Nanny, An odd like Wife, they said that saw, A moupin runckled Granny, She fley'd the Kimmers ane and a', Word gae'd she was na kanny; It was reported she was a Witch. Nor wad they let Lucky awa, Till she was burnt wi' Branny, Like mony mae. Steen fresh and fastin 'mang the rest Came in to get his Morning, Speer'd gin the Bride had tane the Test, I do not mean an Oath of that Name we all have heard of. And how she loo'd her Corning? She leugh as she had fun a Nest, Said, Let a be ye'r Scorning. Quoth Roger, Fegs I've done my best, To ge'er a Charge of Horning, Is a Writ charging to make Payment, declaring the Debitor a Rebel. N. B. It may be left in the Lock-hole, if the Doors be shut. As well's I may. Kind Kirsh was there, a kanty Lass, Black-ey'd, black-hair'd, and bonny; Right well red up and jimp she was, And Wooers had fow mony: I wat na how it came to pass, She cutled in wi' Jonnie, And tumbling wi' him on the Grass, Dung a' her Cockernonny A jee that Day. But Mause begrutten was and bleer'd, Look'd thowless, dowf and sleepy; Auld Maggy kend the Wyt, and sneer'd, Caw'd her a poor daft Heepy: It's a wise Wife that kens her Weird, What tho ye mount the Creepy; The Stool of Repentance. There a good Lesson may be lear'd, And what the war will ye be To stand a Day. Or Bairns can read, they first maun spell, I learn'd this frae my Mammy, And coost a Legen-girth Like a Tub thet loses one of its Bottom Hoops. my sell, Lang or I married Tammie: I'se warrand ye have a' heard tell, Of bonny Andrew Lammy, Stifly in Loove wi' me he fell, As soon as e'er he saw me: That was a Day. Hait Drink, frush butter'd Caiks and Cheese, That held their Hearts aboon, Wi' Clashes mingled aft wi' Lies, Drave aff the hale Forenoon: But after Dinner an ye please, To weary not o're soon, We down to E'ning Edge wi' Ease Shall loup, and see what's done I' the Doup o' the Day. Now what the Friends wad fain been at, They that were right true blue; Was e'en to get their Wysons wat, And fill young Roger fou: 'Tis a Custom for the Friends to endeavour the next Day after the Wedding to make the new married Man as drunk as possible. But the bauld Billy took his Maut, And was right stiff to bow; He fairly ga'e them Tit for Tat, And scour'd aff Healths anew, Clean out that Day. A Creel bout fow of muckle Stains For Merryment, a Creel or Basket is bound, full of Stones, upon his Back; and if he has acted a manly Part, his young Wife with all imaginable Speed cuts the Cords, and relieves him from the Burthen. If she does not, he's rallied for a Fumbler. They clinked on his Back, To try the Pith o's Rigg and Reins, They gart him cadge this Pack. Now as a Sign he had tane Pains, His young Wife was na slack, To rin and ease his Shoulder Bains, And sneg'd the Raips fow snack, We'er Knife that Day. Syne the blyth Carles, Tooth and Nail, Fell keenly to the Wark; To ease the Gantrees of the Ale, And try wha was maist stark; 'Till Boord and Floor, and a' did sail, Wi' spilt Ale i' the Dark; Gart Jock's Fit slide, he like a Fail, Play'd dad, and dang the Bark Aff's Shins that Day. The Souter, Miller, Smith and Dick, Vide Canto II. Line 177. Et cet'ra, closs sat cockin, Till wasted was baith Cash and Tick, Sae ill were they to slocken; Gane out to pish in Gutters thick, Some fell, and some gae'd rockin, Sawny hang sneering on his Stick, To see bauld Hutchon bockin Rainbows that Day. The Smith's Wife her black Deary sought, And fand him Skin and Birn: The Marks of a Sheep; The Burn on the Nose, and the Tar on the Skin. i.e. She was sure it was him, with all the Marks of her drunken Husband about him. Quoth she, This Day's Wark's be dear bought, He ban'd, and gae a Girn; Ca'd her a Jade, and said she mucht Gae hame and scum her Kirn; Whisht Ladren, for gin ye say ought Mair, I'se wind ye a Pirn Is a threatning Expression, when one designs to contrive some malicious thing to vex you. To reel some Day. Ye'll wind a Pirn! Ye silly Snool, Wae-worth ye'r drunken Saul, Quoth she, and lap out o'er a Stool, And claught him be the Spaul: He shook her, and sware muckle Dool Ye's thole for this, ye Scaul; I'se rive frae aff ye'r Hips the Hool, And learn ye to be baul On sic a Day. Your Tippanizing, scant o' Grace, Quoth she, gars me gang duddy; Our Nibour Pate sin Break o' Day's Been thumpin at his Studdy, An it be true that some Fowk says, Ye'll girn yet in a Woody; Syne wi' her Nails she rave his Face, Made a' his black Baird bloody, Wi' Scarts that Day. A Gilpy that had seen the Faught, I wat he was nae lang, Till he had gather'd seven or aught Wild Hempies stout and strang; They frae a Barn a Kaber raught, Ane mounted wi' a Bang, Betwisht twa's Shouders, and sat straught Upon't, and rade the Stang On her The Riding of the Stang on a Woman that hath beat her Husband, is as I have described it, by one's riding upon a Sting, or a long Piece of Wood, carried by two others on their Shoulders, where, like a Herauld, he proclaims the Woman's Name, and the Manner of her unnatural Action. that Day. The Wives and Gytlings a' span'd out O'er Middings, and o'er Dykes, Wi' mony an unco Skirl and Shout, Like Bumbees frae their Bykes; Thro thick and thin they scour'd about, Plashin thro Dubs and Sykes, And sic a Reird ran thro the Rout, Gart a' the hale Town Tykes Yamph loud that Day. But d'ye see fou better bred Was mens-fou Maggy Murdy, She her Man like a Lammy led Hame, wi' a well wail'd Wordy: Fast frae the Company he fled, As he had tane the Sturdy; A Disease amongst Sheep that makes them giddy, and run off from the rest of the Herd. She fleech'd him fairly to his Bed, Wi' ca'ing him her Burdy, Kindly that Day. But Lawrie he took out his Nap Upon a Mow of Pease, And Robin spew'd in's ain Wife's Lap; He said it ga'e him Ease. Hutchon wi' a three lugged Cap, His Head bizzin wi' Bees, Hit Geordy a mislushios Rap, And brake the Brig o's Neese Right sair that Day. Syne ilka Thing gae'd Arse o'er Head, Chanlers, Boord, Stools and Stowps, Flew thro' the House wi' muckle speed, And there was little Hopes, But there had been some ill done Deed, They gat sic thrawart Cowps; But a' the Skaith that chanc'd indeed, Was only on their Dowps, Wi' Faws that Day. Sae whiles they toolied, whiles they drank, Till a' their Sense was smor'd; And in their Maws there was nae Mank, Upon the Furms some snor'd: Ithers frae aff the Bunkers sank, Wi' Een like Collops scor'd: Some ram'd their Noddles wi' a Clank, E'en like a thick scull'd Lord, On Posts that Day. The young Good-man to Bed did clim, His Dear the Door did lock in; Crap down beyont him, and the Rim O' 'er Wame he clap't his Dock on: She fand her Lad was not in Trim, And be this same good Token, That ilka Member, Lith and Limb, Was souple like a Doken, 'Bout him that Day. Notwithstanding all this my publick spirited Pains, I am well assured there are a few heavy Heads, who will bring down the Thick of their Cheeks to the Sides of their Mouths, and richly stupid, alledge there's some Things in it have a Meaning. Well, I own it; and think it handsomer in a few Lines to say Something, than talk a great Deal, and mean Nothing. Pray, is there any Thing vicious or unbecoming in saying, Mens Liths and Limbs are souple when intoxicated? Does it not show, that excessive Drinking enervates and unhinges a Man's Constitution, and makes him uncapable of performing divine or natural Duties. There is the Moral. And believe me, I could raise many useful Notes from every Character, which the Ingenious will presently find out. Great Wits sometimes may gloriously offend, And rise to Faults true Criticks dare not mend; From vulgar Bounds with brave Disorder part, And snatch a Grace beyond the Reach of Art. POPE. Thus have I pursued these Comical Characters, having Gentlemens Health and Pleasure, and the good Manners of the Vulgar in View: The main Design of Comedy being to represent the Follie and Mistakes of low Life in a just Light, making them appear as ridiculous as they really are, that each who is a Spectator, may evite his being the Object of Laughter. Any Body that has a mind to look sour upon it, may use their Freedom. Not laugh, Beasts, Fishes, Fowls, nor Reptiles can; That's a peculiar Happiness of Man: When govern'd with a prudent chearful Grace, 'Tis one of the first Beauties of the Face. THE SCRIBLERS LASH'D. You write Pindaricks! and be d?nd, Write Epigrams for Cutlers; None with thy Nonsense will be sham'd But Chamber-maids and Butlers. In t'other World expect dry blows, No Tears shall wipe thy Stains out: Horace shall pluck thee by the Nose, And Pindar beat thy Brains out. T. Brown to T. D'urfy. That I thus prostitute my Muse On Theme so low, may gain Excuse; When following Motives shall be thought on, Which has this dogrel Fury brought on. I'm call'd in Honour to protect The Fair when tret with Disrespect: Besides, a Zeal transports my Soul, Which no Constraint can e'er controul; In Service of the Government, To draw my Pen, and Satyr vent, Against vile Mungrels of Parnassus, Who through Impunity oppress us. 'Tis to correct this scribbling Crew, Who, as in former Reigns, so now Torment the World, and load our Time With Jargon cloath'd in wretched Rhime, Disgrace of Numbers! Earth! I hate them! And as they merit, so I'll treat them. And first, these ill bred Things I lash, That hated Authors of the Trash, In publick spread with little Wit, Much Malice, rude and bootless Spite, Against the Sex, who have no Arms To shield them from insulting Harms, Except the Light'ning of their Eye, Which none but such blind Dolts defy. Ungen'rous War! t'attack the Fair: But Ladies fear not, ye're the Care Of every Wit of true Descent, At once their Song and Ornament: They'll ne'er neglect the lovely Crowd: But spite of all the Multitude Of scribbling Fops, assert your Cause, And execute Apollo's Laws: Apollo, who the Bard inspires With softest Thoughts and divine Fires; Than whom on all the Earth there's no Man More complaisant to a fine Woman. Such Veneration mixt with Love, Points out a Poet from above: But Zanny's void of Sense and Merit, Love, Fire, or Fancy, Wit or Spirit: Weak, frantick, clownish, and chagreen, Pretending, prompt by zealous Spleen, T'affront your Head-dress, or your Bone-fence, Make Printers Presses groan with Nonsense. But while Sol's Offspring lives, as soon Shall they pull down his Sister Moon. They with low incoherent Stuff, Dark Sense, or none, Lines lame and rough; Without a Thought, Air or Address, All the whole Logerhead confess. From clouded Notions in the Brain, They scrible in a cloudy Strain: Desire of Verse they reckon Wit, And rhime without one Grain of it. Then hurry forth in publick Town Their Scrawls, lest they should be unknown. Rather than want a Fame, they choose The Plague of an infamous Muse. Unthinking, thus the Sots aspire, And raise their own Reproach the high'r: By meddling with the Modes and Fashions Of Women of politest Nations. Perhaps by this they'd have it told us, That in their Spirit something bold is, To challenge those who have the Skill, By Charms to save, and Frowns to kill. If not Ambition, then 'tis Spite, Which makes the puny Insects write. Like old and mouldy Maids turn'd sour, When distant Charms have lost their Pow'r, Fly out in loud Transports of Passion, When ought that's new comes first in Fashion; 'Till by Degrees it creeps right snodly On Hips and Head-dress of the g?y. Thus they to please the sighing Sisters, Who often beet them in their Misters, Oblige them upon Occasion. With their malicious Breath set sail, And write these silly Things they rail. Pimps! Such as you can ne'er extend A Flight of Wit, which may amend Our Morals; that's a Plot too nice For you to laugh Folks out of Vice. Sighing, Oh hey! Ye cry, Alace! This Fardingale's a great Disgrace! And all indeed, because an Ancle, Or Foot is seen, might Monarchs mancle; And makes the Wise, with Face upright, Look up, and bless Heav'n for their Sight. In your Opinion nothing matches, O horrid Sin! the Crime of Patches! 'Tis false, ye Clowns; I'll make't appear, The glorious Sun does Patches wear: Yea, run thro' all the Frame of Nature, You'll find a Patch for ev'ry Creature: Even you your selves, ye blackned Wretches, To Heliconians are the Patches. But grant that Ladies Modes were Ills To be reform'd; your creeping Skills, Ye Rhimers, never would succeed, Who write what the polite ne'er read. To cure an Error of the Fair, Demands the nicest prudent Care; Wit utter'd in a pleasing Strain, A Point so delicate may gain: But that's a Task as far above Your shallow Reach, as I'm from Jove. No more then let the World be vexed With Baggage empty and perplexed: But learn to speak with due Respect Of Peggie's Breasts and Ivory Neck. Such purblind Eyes as yours 'tis true, Shou'd ne'er such divine Beauties view. If Nellie's Hoop be twice as wide, As her two pretty Limbs can stride; What then? Will any Man of Sense Take Umbrage, or the least Offence, At what even the most modest may Expose to Phebus' brightest Ray? Does not the handsome of our City, The Pious, Chaste, the Kind and Witty, Who can afford it, great and small, Regard well shapen Fardingale? And will you, Mag-pyes, make a Noise? You grumble at the Lady's Choice? Pray leav't to them, and Mothers wise, Who watch their Conduct, Mein and Guise, To shape their Weeds as fits their Ease; And place their Patches as they please. This shou'd be granted without grudging, Since we all know they're best at judging, What from Mankind demands Devotion, In Gesture, Garb, free Airs, and Motion. But you! Unworthy of my Pen! Unworthy to be class'd with Men! Haste to Caffar, ye clumsy Sots, And there make Love to Hottentots. Another Sett with Ballads waste Our Paper, and debauch our Taste With endless 'larms on the Street, Where Crowds of circling Rabble meet. The Vulgar judge of Poetry, By what these Hawkers sing and cry: Yea, some who claim to Wit amiss, Cannot distinguish That from This. Hence Poets are accounted now In Scotland a mean empty Crew; Whose Heads are craz'd, who spend their Time In that poor wretched Trade of Rhime. Yet all the learn'd discerning Part Of Mankind own the heav'nly Art Is as much distant from such Trash, As lay'd Dutch Coin from Sterling Cash. Others in lofty Nonsense write; Incomprehensible's their Flight; Such magick Pow'r is in their Pen, They can bestow on worthless Men More Virtue, Merit and Renown, Than ever they cou'd call their own. They write with arbitrary Power, And Pity 'tis they shou'd fall lower; Or stoop to Truth, or yet to meddle With common Sense, for Crambo didle. But none of all the rhiming Herd Are more encourag'd and rever'd By heavy Souls to their's ally'd, Than such who tell who lately dy'd. No sooner is the Spirit flown, From its Clay Cage, to Lands unknown, Than some rash Hackney gets his Name, And thro' the Town laments the same: An honest Burgess cannot dy, But they must weep in Elegy; Even when the virtuous Soul is soaring Thro' middle Air, he hears it roaring. These Ills, and many more Abuses, Which plague Mankind, and vex the Muses, On Pain of Poverty shall cease, And all the Fair shall live in Peace: And every one shall die contented, Happy when not by them lamented. For great Apollo in his Name, Has ord'red me thus to proclaim: “Forasmuchas a grov'ling Crew, “With narrow Mind, and brazen Brow, “Wou'd fain to Poets Title mount, “And with vile Maggots rub Affront “On an old Virtuoso Nation, “Where our lov'd Nine maintain their Station: “We order strick, that all refrain “To write, who Learning want, and Brain; “Pedants, with Hebrew Roots o'ergrown, “Learn'd in each Language but their own. “Each spiritless half starving Sinner, “Who knows not how to get his Dinner: “Dealers in small Ware, Clinks, Whim Whams, “Acrosticks, Puns, and Anagrams; “And all who their Productions grudge, “To be canvast by skilful Judge, “Who can find out indulgent Trip, “Whilst 'tis in harmless Manuscript. “But to all them who disobey, “And jog on still in their own Way; “Be't kend to all Men that our Will is, “Since all they write so wretched ill is; “They must dispatch their shallow Ghosts, “To Pluto's Jakes, and take their Posts; “There to attend, 'till Dis shall deign “To use their Works; the Use is plain. Now know, ye Scoundrels, if ye stand To humph and ha at this Command, The Furies have prepar'd a Halter, To hang, or drive ye helter skelter, Through Bogs and Moors, like Rats and Mice, Pursu'd with Hunger, Rags and Lice, If e'er ye dare again to croak, And God of Harmony provoke. Wherefore pursue some Craft for Bread, Where Hands may better serve than Head; Nor ever hope in Verse to shine, Or share in Homer's Fate or ?. CONTENT. A POEM. Content is Wealth, the Riches of the Mind; And happy he who can that Treasure find: But the base Miser starves amidst his Store, Broods on his Gold, and gripping still for more, Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor. Dryden. Virtue was taught in Verse, and Athens' Glory rose. Prior. When genial Beams wade thro' the dewy Morn, And from the Clod invite the sprouting Corn; When chequer'd Green, wing'd Musick, new blown Scents, Conspir'd to sooth the Mind, and please each Sense: Then down a shady Haugh I took my Way, Delighted with each Flower and budding Spray; Musing on all that Hurry, Pain and Strife, Which flow from the phantastick Ills of Life. Enlarg'd from such Distresses of the Mind, Due Gratitude to Heav'n my Thoughts refin'd, And made me in the laughing Sage's Democritus. Way, As a mere Farce the murm'ring World survey; Finding imagin'd Maladies abound, Tenfold for one, which gives a real Wound. Godlike is he whom no false Fears annoy, Who lives content, and grasps the present Joy; Whose Mind is not with wild Convulsions rent Of Pride, and Avarice, and Discontent: Whose well train'd Passions, with a pious Aw, Are all subordinate to Reason's Law: Then smooth Content arises like the Day, And makes each rugged Phantom fly away. To lowest Men she gives a lib'ral Share Of solid Bliss, she mitigates our Care, Enlarging Joys, administrating Health; The rich Man's Pleasure, and the poor Man's Wealth; A Train of Comforts on her Nod attend, And to her Sway Profits and Honours bend. Hail blest Content! who art by Heav'n design'd Parent of Health and Chearfulness of Mind; Serene Content shall animate my Song, And make the immortal Numbers smooth and strong. Silenus, thou whose hoary Beard and Head Experience speak, and Youth's Attention plead; Retail thy gather'd Knowledge, and disclose What State of Life enjoys the most Repose. Thus I addrest:—And thus the ancient Bard;— First, to no State of Life fix thy Regard. All Mortals may be happy, if they please, Nor rack'd with Pain, nor lingering Disease. Midas the Wretch, wrapt in his patched Rags, With empty Paunch, sits brooding o'er his Bags; Meager his Look, his Mind in constant Fright, If Winds but move his Windows in the Night; If Dogs should bark, or but a Mouse make Din, He sweats and starts, and thinks the Thief's got in: His Sleep forsakes him 'till the Dawn appears, Which every Thing but such a Caitiff chears; It gives him Pain to buy a Farthing-Light, He jums at Home in Darkness all the Night. What makes him manage with such cautious Pain? 'Twould break a Sum; a Farthing spent so vain! If e'er he's pleased, 'tis when some needful Man Gives Ten per Cent with an insuring Pawn, Tho he's provided in as much would serve Whole Nestor's Years, he ever fears to starve. Tell him of Alms, alas! he'd rather chuse Damnation and the promis'd Bliss refuse. —And is there such a Wretch beneath the Sun—? Yes, he return'd, Thousands instead of one, To whom Content is utterly unknown.— Are all the rich Men such?—He answer'd, No; Marcus hath Wealth, and can his Wealth bestow Upon himself, his Friends, and on the Poor, Enjoys enough, and wishes for no more. Reverse of these, is he who braves the Skie, Cursing his Maker when he throws the Die: Gods, Devils, Furies, Hell, Heaven, Blood and Wounds, Promiscuous fly in Bursts of tainted Sounds: He to Perdition doth his Soul bequeath, Yet inly trembles when he thinks of Death. Except at Game, he ne'er employs his Thought Till hiss'd and pointed at,—not worth a Groat. The desp'rate Remnant of a large Estate Goes at one Throw, and points his gloomy Fate; He finds his Folly now, but finds too late. Ill brooks my fondling Master to be poor, Bred up to nought but Bottle, Game, and Whore. How pitiful he looks without his Rent! They who fly Vertue, ever fly Content. Now I beheld the Sage look'd less severe, Whilst Pity join'd his old Satyrick Lear. The weakly Mind, said he, is quickly torn, Men are not Gods, some Frailties must be born: Heaven's bounteous Hand all in their Turn abuse, The happiest Men at Times their Fate refuse, Befool themselves,—and trump up an Excuse. Is Lucius but a Subaltern of Foot? His Equal Gallus is a Coronet. Sterilla shuns a Gossiping, and why? The teeming Mother fills her with Envy. The pregnant Matron's Grief as much prevails, Some of the Children always something ails: One Boy is sick, t'other has broke his Head, And Nurse is blam'd when little Miss is dead. A Dutchess on a Velvet Couch reclin'd, Blabs her fair Cheeks till she is almost blind; Poor Phili's Death the briny Pearls demands, Who ceases now to snarl and lick her Hands. The Politicians, who in learn'd Debates, With Penetration carve out Kingdoms Fates, Look sour, drink Coffee, shrug, and read Gazettes: Deep sunk in Craft of State their Souls are lost, And all their Hopes depend upon the Post: Each Mail that's due they curse the contrair Wind, 'Tis strange if this Way Men Contentment find. Tho old, their Humors I am yet to learn, Who vex themselves in what they've no Concern. Ninny the glaring Fop, who always runs In Tradesmen's Books, which makes the careful Duns Often e'er Ten to break his slumb'ring Rest: Whilst with their craving Clamours he's opprest, He frames Excuses 'till his Cranny akes, Then thinks he justly damns the cursed Snakes. The disappointed Dun with as much Ire, Both threats and curses till his Breast's on Fire: Then home he goes, and pours it on his House, His Servants suffer oft, and oft his Spouse. Some groan thro' Life amidst a Heap of Cares, To load with too much Wealth their lazy Heirs: The lazy Heir turns all to Ridicule, And all his Life proclaims his Father Fool. He toils in spending.—Leaves a Threed-bare Son, To scrape anew, as had his Grandsire done. How is the fair Myrtilla's Bosom fir'd, If Leda's sable Locks are more admir'd; While Leda does her secret Sighs discharge, Because her Mouth's a Straw-breadth, ah! too large. Thus sung the Sire, and left me to evite The scorching Beams in some cool green Retreat; Where gentle Slumber seiz'd my weary'd Brain, And mimick Fancy op'd the following Scene. Methought I stood upon a rising Ground, A splendid Landskip open'd all around, Rocks, Rivers, Meadows, Gardens, Parks and Woods, And Domes, which hid their Turrets in the Clouds; To me approach'd a Nymph divinely fair, Celestial Virtue shone through all her Air: A Nymph for Grace, her Wisdom more renown'd Adorn'd each Grace, and both true Valour crown'd. Around her heav'nly Smiles a Helmet blaz'd, And graceful as she mov'd, a Spear she gently rais'd. My Sight at first the Lustre scarce could bear, Her dazling Glories shone so strong and clear: A Majesty sublime, with all that's sweet, Did Adoration claim, and Love invite. I felt her Wisdom's Charm my Thoughts inspire, Her dauntless Courage set my Soul on Fire. The Maid, when thus I knew, I soon addrest, My present wishful Thoughts the Theme suggest: “Of all th'etherial Powers thou noblest Maid, “To humane Weakness lend'st the readiest Aid: “To where Content and her blest Train reside, “Immortal Pallas, deign to be my Guide. With my Request well pleas'd, our Course we bent, To find the Habitation of Content. Thro' fierce Bellona's Tents we first advanc'd, Where Cannons bounc'd, and nervous Horses pranc'd: Here Vi &amp; Armis sat with dreadful Aw And daring Front, to prop each Nation's Law: Attending Squadrons on her Motions wait, Array'd in Deaths, and fearless of their Fate. Here Chiftain Souls glow'd with as great a Fire, As his who made the World but one Empire. Even in low Ranks brave Spirits might be found, Who wanted nought of Monarchs but a Crown. But ah! Ambition stood a Foe to Peace, Shaking the Empty Fob and ragged Fleece; Which were more hideous to these Sons of War, Than Brimstone, Smoak, and Storms of Bullets are. Here, said my Guide, Content is rarely found, Where Blood and noisy Jars beset the Ground. Trade's wealthy Ware-house next fell in our Way, Where in great Bales Part of each Nation lay, The Spanish Citron, and Hesperia's Oil, Persia's soft Product, and the Chinese Toil; Warm Borneo's Spices, Arab's scented Gum, The Polish Amber, and the Saxon Mum, The Orient Pearl, Holland's Lace and Toys, And Tinsie Work, which the fair Nun imploys. From India Ivory, and the clouded Cane, And Coacheneal from Straits of Magellan. The Scandinavian Rosin, Hemp and Tar, The Lapland Furs, and Russia's Caviare, The Gallick Punchion charg'd with Ruby Juice, Which makes the Hearts of Gods and Men rejoice. Britannia here pours from her plenteous Horn, Her shining Mirrors, Clock-work, Cloaths and Corn. Here Cent per Cents sat poring o'er their Books, While many shew'd the Bankrupts in their Looks, Who by Mismanagement their Stock had spent, Curs'd these hard Times, and blam'd the Government. The Missive Letter, and peremptor Bill, Forbade them rest, and call'd forth all their Skill. Uncertain Credit bore the Sceptre here, And her prime Ministers were Hope and Fear. The surly Chufs demanded what we sought, Content, said I, may she with Gold be bought? Content! said one, then star'd and bit his Thumb, And leering ask'd, if I was worth a Plum. 100,000 Lib. Love's fragrant Fields, where mildest western Gales, Loaden with Sweets, perfume the Hills and Dales; Where longing Lovers haunt the Streams and Glades, And cooling Groves, whose Verdure never fades; Thither with Joy and hasty Steps we strode, There sure I thought our long'd for Bliss abode. Whom first we met on that enchanted Plain, Was a tall Yellow-hair'd young pensive Swain; Him I addrest,—“O Youth, what heavenly Power “Commands and graces yon Elysian Bower? “Sure 'tis Content, else much I am deceiv'd. The Shepherd sigh'd, and told me that I rav'd. Rare she appears, unless on some fine Day She grace a Nuptial, but soon hasts away: If her you seek, soon hence you must remove, Her Presence is precarious in Love. Thro' these and other Shrines we wander'd long, Which merit no Description in my Song: 'Till at the last, methought we cast our Eye Upon an antique Temple, square and high, Its Area wide, its Spire did pierce the Sky; On adamantine Dorick Pillars rear'd, Strong Gothick Work the massy Pile appear'd: Nothing seem'd little, all was great design'd, Which pleas'd the Eye at once, and fill'd the Mind. Whilst Wonder did my curious Thoughts engage, To us approach'd a studious rev'rend Sage: Both Aw and Kindness his grave Aspect bore, Which spoke him rich with Wisdom's finest Store. He ask'd our Errand there,—“Straight, I reply'd, “Content; in these high Towers does she reside? Not far from hence, said he, her Palace stands, Ours she regards, as we do her Demands, Philosophy sustains her peaceful Sway, And in Return she feasts us every Day. Then straight an antient Telescope he brought, By Socrates and Epictetus wrought, Improved since, made easier to the Sight, Lengthen'd the Tube, the Glasses ground more bright: Through this he shew'd a Hill, whose lofty Brow Enjoy'd the Sun, while Vapours all below, In pitchy Clouds, encircled it around, Where Phantoms of most horrid Forms abound; The ugly Brood of lazy Spleen and Fear, Frightful in Shape, most monstrous appear. Then thus my Guide,— Your Way lies through yon Gloom, be not agast, Come briskly on, you'll jest them when they're past: Mere empty Spectres, harmless as the Air, Which merit not your Notice, less your Care. Encourag'd with her Word, I thus addrest My noble Guide, and grateful Joy exprest. “O sacred Wisdom! Thine's the Source of Light, “Without thy Blaze the World would grope in Night. “Of Woe and Bliss thou only art the Test, “Falshood and Truth before thee stand confest: “Thou mak'st a double Life: One Nature gave, “But without thine, what is it Mortals have? “A breathing Motion grazing to the Grave. Now through the Damps methought we boldly went, Smiling at all the Grins of Discontent: Tho oft pull'd back, the rising Ground we gain'd, Whilst inward Joy my weary'd Limbs sustain'd. Arriv'd the Height, whose Top was large and plain, And what appear'd soon recompens'd my Pain, Nature's whole Beauty deck'd the enamell'd Scene. Amidst the Glade the sacred Palace stood, The Architecture not so fine as good; Nor scrimp, nor gousty, regular and plain, Plain were the Columns which the Roof sustain: An easy Greatness in the whole was found, Where all that Nature wanted did abound. But here no Beds are screen'd with rich Brocade, Nor Fewel-Logs in Silver Grates are laid: No broken China Bowls disturb the Joy Of waiting Handmaid, or the running Boy; Nor in the Cupboard Heaps of Plate are rang'd, To be with each splenetick Fashion chang'd. A weather-beaten Sentry watch'd the Gate, Of Temper cross, and practis'd in Debate: Till once acquaint with him, no Entry here, Tho brave as Cæsar, or as Helen fair: To Strangers fierce, but with Familiars tame, And Touchstone Disappointment was his Name. This fair Inscription shone above the Gate, Fear not but him whose Will directs thy Fate. With Smile austere he lifted up his Head, Pointed the Characters and bid us read. We did, and stood resolv'd. The Gates at last Op'd of their own Accord, and in we past. Each Day a Herauld, by the Queen's Command, Was order'd on a Mount to take his Stand, And thence to all the Earth this Offer make, “Who are inclin'd her Favours to partake, “Shall have them free, if they small Rubs can bear “Of Disappointment, Spleen and bug-bear Fear. Rais'd on a Throne within the outer Gate, The Goddess sat, her Vot'ries round her wait: The beautiful Divinity disclos'd Sweetness sublime, which roughest Cares compos'd: Her looks sedate, yet joyful and serene, Not rich her Dress, but suitable and clean: Unfurrow'd was her Brow, her Cheeks were smooth, Tho old as Time, enjoy'd immortal Youth; And all her Accents so harmonious flow'd, That ev'ry listning Ear with Pleasure glow'd. An Olive Garland on her Head she wore, And her right Hand a Cornucopia bore. Cross Touchstone fill'd a Bench without the Door, To try the Sterling of each humane Ore: Grim Judge he was, and them away he sent, Unfit t'approach the Shrine of calm Content. To him a hoary Dotard load with Bags: Unweildy Load! to one who hardly drags His Being.—More than Seventy Years, said he, I've sought this Court, 'till now unfound by me: Now let me rest,—“Yes, if ye want no more; “But e'er the Sun has made his annual Tour, “Know, grov'ling Wretch, thy Wealth's without thy Pow'r. The Thoughts of Death, and ceasing from his Gain, Brought on the old Man's Head so sharp a Pain, Which dim'd his optick Nerves, and with the Light He lost the Palace, and crawl'd back to Night. Poor gripping Thing, how useless is thy Breath, While nothing's so much long'd for as thy Death? How meanly hast thou spent thy Lease of Years? A Slave to Poverty, to Toils and Fears; And all to vie with some black rugged Hill, Whose rich Contents Millions of Chests can fill. As round the greedy Rock clings to the Mine, And hinders it in open Day to shine, Till Diggers hew it from the Spar's Embrace, Making it circle, stampt with Cæsar's Face; So dost thou hoard, and from thy Prince purloin His useful Image, and thy Country Coin, Till gaping Heirs have free'd th'imprison'd Slave, When to their Comfort thou hast fill'd a Grave. The next who with a janty Air approach'd, Was a gay Youth, who thither had been coach'd: Sleek were his Flanders Mares, his Liv'ries fine, With glittering Gold his Furniture did shine. Sure such methought may enter when they please, Who have all these Appearances of Ease. Strutting he march'd, nor any Leave he crav'd, Attemp't to pass, but found himself deceiv'd: Old Touchstone gave him on the Breast a Box, Which op'd the Sluces of a latent Pox, Then bid his Equipage in Haste depart. The Youth look'd at them with a fainting Heart; He found he could not walk, and bid them stay, Swore three cramp Oaths, mounted and wheel'd away. The Pow'r express'd herself thus with a Smile, “These changing Shadows are not worth our while; “With smallest Trifles oft their Peace is torn, “If here at Night, they rarely wait the Morn. Another Beau as fine, but more vivace, Whose Airs sat round him with an easy Grace, And well bred Motion, came up to the Gate, I lov'd him much, and trembl'd for his Fate. The Sentry broke his clouded Cane,—He smil'd, Got fairly in, and all our Fears beguil'd. The Cane was soon renew'd which had been broke, And thus the Vertue to the Circle spoke, “Each Thing magnificent or gay we grant, “To them who're capable to bear their Want. Two handsome Toasts came next, them well I knew, Their lovely Make the Court's Observance drew; Three waiting Maids attended in the Rear, Each loaden with as much as she could bear: One mov'd beneath a Load of Silks and Lace, Another bore the Offsets of the Face; But the most bulky Burden of the Three, Was hers who bore the Utensils of Bohee. My Mind indulgent in their Favour pled, Hoping no Opposition would be made: So mannerly, so smooth, so mild their Eye, Enough almost to give Content Envy. But soon I found my Error, the bold Judge, Who acted as if prompted by some Grudge, Them thus saluted with a hollow Tone, “You're none of my Acquaintance, get you gone; “What Loads of Trump'ry these?—Ha, where's my Cross? “I'll try if these be solid Ware or boss, The China felt the Fury of his Blow, And lost a Being, or for Use or Show; For Use or Show no more's each Plate or Cup, But all in Shreds upon the Threshold drop. Now every Charm which deck'd their Face before, Give Place to Rage, and Beauty is no more. The brinny Stream their rosy Cheeks besmear'd, Whilst they in Clouds of Vapours disappear'd. A rustick Hynd, attir'd in home-spun Gray, With forked Locks, and Shoes bedaub'd with Clay; Palms shod with Horn, his Front fresh, brown and broad, With Legs and Shoulders fitted for a Load; He 'midst ten bawling Children laugh'd and sung, While Consort Hobnails on the Pavement rung: Up to the Porter unconcern'd he came, Forcing along his Offspring and their Dame. Cross Touchstone strove to stop him, but the Clown At Handy-cuffs him match'd, and threw him down; And spite of him into the Palace went, Where he was kindly welcom'd by Content. Two Busbian Philosophs put in their Claims, Gamaliel and Critis were their Names; But soon's they had our British Homer seen, With Face unruffl'd waiting on the Queen, Envious Hate their surly Bosoms fir'd, Their Colour chang'd, they from the Porch retir'd: Backward they went, reflecting with much Rage On the bad Taste and Humor of the Age, Which pay'd so much Respect to nat'ral Parts, While they were starving Graduates of Arts. The Goddess fell a laughing at the Fools, And sent them packing to their Grammar Schools; Or in some Garret elevate to dwell, There with Sisyphian Toil to teach young Beaus to spell. Now all this while a Gale of Eastern Wind, And cloudy Skies opprest the humane Mind; The Wind set West, back'd with the radiant Beams, Which warm'd the Air, and danc'd upon the Streams, Exhal'd the Spleen, and sooth'd a World of Souls, Who crowded now the Avenue in Shoals. Numbers in black, of Widowers, Relicts, Heirs, Of new wed Lovers many handsome Pairs; Men landed from Abroad, from Camps and Seas; Others got through some dangerous Disease: A Train of Belles adorn'd with something new, And even of ancient Prudes there were a few, Who were refresh'd with Scandal and with Tea, Which for a Space set them from Vapours free. Here from their Cups the lower Species flockt, And Knaves with Bribes and cheating Methods stockt. The Pow'r survey'd the Troop, and gave command They should no longer in the Entry stand, But be convey'd into Chimera's Tower, There to attend her Pleasure for an Hour. Soon as they entred, Apprehension shook The Fabrick: Fear was fixt on every Look, Old Age and Poverty, Disease, Disgrace, With horrid Grin, star'd full in every Face, Which made them, trembling at their unknown Fate, Issue in Haste out by the postern Gate. None waited out their Hour but only two, Who had been wedded Fifteen Years ago. The Man had learn'd the World, and fixt his Mind; His Spouse was chearful, beautiful and kind: She neither fear'd the Shock, nor Phantoms Stare: She thought her Husband wise, and knew that he was there. Now while the Court was sitting, my fair Guide Into a fine Elysium me convey'd; I saw, or thought I saw the spacious Fields Adorn'd with all prolifick Nature yields, Profusely rich, with her most valu'd Store: But as m' enchanted Fancy wander'd o'er The happy plain, new Beauties seem'd to rise, The Fields were fled, and all was painted Skies. Pleas'd for a while, I wish'd the former Scene; Straight all return'd and eas'd me of my Pain. Again the flow'ry Meadows disappear, And Hills and Groves their stately Summits rear; These sink again, and rapid Rivers flow, Next from the Rivers Cities seem to grow. Sometime the fleeting Scene I had forgot, In busie Thought intranc'd, with Pain I sought To know the hidden Charm, straight all was fled And boundless Heav'ns o'er boundless Ocean spread; Impatient I obtest my noble Guide, Reveal this wond'rous Secret, she reply'd. We carried on what greatly we design'd, When all these humane Follies you resign'd, Ambition, Lux'ry, and a cov'tous Mind: Yet think not true Content can thus be bought, There's wanting still a Train of virtuous Thought. When me your Leader prudently you chose, And listning to my Counsel, didst refuse Fantastick Joys, your Soul was thus prepar'd For true Content; and thus I do reward Your gen'rous Toil. Observe this wondrous Clime; Of Nature's Blessings here are hid the Prime: But wise and virtuous Thought in constant Course, Must draw these Beauties from their hidden Source; The smallest Intermissions will transform The pleasant Scene, and spoil each perfect Charm. 'Tis ugly Vice will rob you of Content, And to your View all hellish Woes present. Nor grudge the Care in Vertue you employ, Your present Toil will prove your future Joy. Then smil'd she heav'nly sweet, and parting said, Hold fast your virtuous Mind, of nothing be afraid. A while the charming Voice so fill'd my Ears, I grieve the divine Form no more appears. Then to confirm my yet unsteady Mind, Under a lonely Shadow I reclin'd, To try the Virtues of the Clime I sought: Then straight call'd up a Train of hideous Thought, Famine, and Blood, and Pestilence appear, Wild Shrieks and loud Laments disturb mine Ear; New Woes and Horrors did my Sight alarm. Envy and Hate compos'd the wretched Charm. Soon as I saw, I dropt the hateful View, And thus I sought past Pleasures to renew. To heav'nly Love my Thoughts I next compose, Then quick as thought the following Sigh[t]s disclose: Streams, Meadows, Grotto's, Groves, Birds carrolling, Calmness, and temp'rate Warmth, and endless Spring; A perfect Transcript of these upper Bowers, The Habitation of th'immortal Powers. Back to the Palace ravished I went, Resolved to reside with blest Content, Where all my special Friends methought I met, In Order 'mongst the best of Mankind set: My Soul with too much Pleasure overcharg'd, The captiv'd Senses to their Post enlarg'd: Lifting mine Eyes I view'd declining Day, Sprang from the Green, and homeward bent my Way, Reflecting on that Hurry, Pain and Strife Which flow from false and real Ills of Life. RICHY and SANDY Sir Richard Steel and Mr. Alexander Pope., A PASTORAL On the Death of JOSEPH ADDISON, Esq; RICHY. What gars thee look sae dowf, dear Sandy, say? Chear up dull Fallow, take thy Reed and play, My Apron Deary,—or some wanton Tune: Be merry Lad, and keep thy Heart aboon. SANDY. Na, na, It winna do! Leave me to mane, This aught Days twice o'er tell'd I'll whistle nane. RICHY. Wow Man, that's unco' sad,—Is that ye'r Jo Has ta'en the Strunt?—Or has some Bogle-bo Glowrin frae 'mang auld Waws gi'en ye a Fleg? Or has some dawted Wedder broke his Leg? SANDY. Naithing like that, sic Troubles eith were born, What's Bogles,—Wedders,—or what's Mausy's Scorn? Our loss is meikle mair, and past Remeed, Edie, that play'd, and sang sae sweet, is dead. RICHY. Dead, say'st thou; Oh! Had up my Heart O Pan! Ye Gods! What Laids ye lay on feckless Man! Alake therefore, I canna wyt ye'r Wae, I'll bear ye Company for Year and Day. A better Lad ne'er lean'd out o'er a Kent, Or hounded Coly o'er the mossy Bent: Blyth at the Bought how aft ha' we three been, Heartsome on Hills, and gay upon the Green. SANDY. That's true indeed! But now thae Days are gane, And with him a' that's pleasant on the Plain. A Summer Day I never thought it lang To hear him make a Roundel or a Sang. How sweet His Poetick Epistle from Italy to the Earl Halifax. he sung where Vines and Myrtles grow, Of wimpling Waters which in Latium flow. Titry the Mantuan Herd wha lang sinsyne Best sung on aeten Reed the Lover's Pine, Had he been to the fore now in our Days, Wi' Edie he had frankly dealt his Bays. As lang's the Warld shall Amaryllis ken, His Rosamond An Opera wrote by him. shall eccho thro' the Glen; While on Burn Banks the yellow Gowan grows, Or wand'ring Lambs rin bleeting after Ews, His Fame shall last: last shall his Sang of Weirs, His Campaign; An heroick Poem. While British Bairns brag of their bauld Forbears. We'll mickle miss his blyth and witty Jest At Spaining Time, or at our Lambmass Feast. O, Richy, but 'tis hard that Death ay reaves Away the best Fowck, and the ill anes leaves. Hing down ye'r Heads ye Hills, greet out ye'r Springs. Upon ye'r Edge na mair the Shepherd sings. RICHY. Than he had ay a good Advice to gi'e, And kend my Thoughts amaist as well as me; Had I been thowless, vext, or oughtlins sow'r, He wad have made me blyth in haff an Hour. Had Rosie ta'en the Dorts,—or had the Tod Worry'd my Lamb,—or were my Feet ill shod, Kindly he'd laugh when sae he saw me dwine, And tauk of Happiness like a Divine. Of ilka Thing he had an unco' Skill, He kend be Moon Light how Tides ebb and fill. He kend, what kend he no? E'en to a Hair He'd tell o'er Night gin neist Day wad be fair. Blind John The famous Mr. Milton, the Author of the excellent Poem on Paradice lost, was blind., ye mind, wha sang in kittle Phrase, How the ill Sp'rit did the first Mischief raise; Mony a Time beneath the auld birk-tree, What's bonny in that Sang he loot me see. The Lasses aft flang down their Rakes and Pales, And held their Tongues, O strange! to hear his Tales. SANDY. Sound be his Sleep, and saft his Wak'ning be, He's in a better Case than thee or me; He was o'er good for us; the Gods hae ta'en Their ain but back,—he was a borrow'd Len. Let us bed, gin goo Virtue be our Drift, Then may we yet forgether 'boon the Lift. But see the Sheep are wysing to the Cleugh; Thomas has loos'd his Ousen frae the Pleugh; Maggy by this has bewk the Supper-Scones, And nuckle Kye stand rowting on the Loans: Come, Richy, let us truse and hame o'er bend, And make the best of what we canna mend. An Explanation of Richy and Sandy, by Josiah Burchet, Esq; RICHY. What makes thee look so sad? dear Sandy say. Rouse up dull Fellow, take thy Reed and play A merry Jig, or try some other Art, To raise thy Spirits, and cheer up thy Heart. SANDY. No, no, it will not do! Leave me to moan, Till twice eight Days are past I'll whistle none. RICHY. That's strange indeed! Has Jenny made the[e] sad? Or, tell me, hath some horrid Spectre, Lad, (Glaring from Ruins old, in silent Night) Surpriz'd, and put thee in a panic Fright? Or ails that Wedder ought, thy Favourite? SANDY. Such Troubles might with much more Ease be born: What's Goblins, Wedders, or what's Woman's Scorn? Our Loss is greater far; for Addy's dead, Addy, who sang so sweetly on the Mead. RICHY. Dead is he, say'st thou? Guard my Heart, oh Pan! What Burthens, Gods, ye lay on feeble Man! Alack I cannot blame thee for thy Grief; Nor hope I, more than thou, to find Relief. A better Lad ne'er lean'd on Shepherd's Crook, Nor after Game halloo'd his Dog to look, How glad where Ews give Milk have we three been, Merry on Hills, and gay upon the Green! SANDY. That's true indeed; but now, alas! in vain We seek for Pleasure on the rural Plain: I never thought a Summer's Day too long To hear his Couplets, or his tuneful Song. How sweet he sang where Vines and Myrtles grow, And winding Streams which in old Latium flow! Titry, the Mantuan Herd, who long ago Sang best on Oaten Reed the Lover's Woe, Did he, fam'd Bard, but live in these our Days, He would with Addy freely share his Bays. As long as Shepherds Amaryllis hear, So long his Rosamond shall please the Ear. While spangled Daisie near the Riv'let grows, And tender Lambs seek after bleating Ews, His Fame shall last. Last shall his Song of Wars, While British Youngsters boast of Ancestors. Much shall we miss his merry witty Jests, At weaning Times, and at our Lambmass Feasts. Oh Richy! Richy! Death hath been unkind To take the Good, and leave the Ill behind. Bow down your Heads ye Hills, weep dry your Springs, For on their Banks no more the Shepherd sings. RICHY. Then he had always good Advice to give, And could my Thoughts, like as my self, conceive. When I've been drooping, vex'd, or in the Spleen, In one half Hour with him I've merry been. Had Jenny froward been, or Raynard bold Worry'd my Lamb, or were my Shoes grown old; Kindly he'd smile, when he observ'd me grieve, And by his Talk divine my Breast relieve. Addy did all Things to Perfection know; Saw by the Moon how Tides would ebb or flow. He knew, what knew he not? E'en to a Hair He'd tell o'er Night if next Day would be fair. The fam'd blind Bard sang in mysterious Phrase How envious Satan did first Mischief raise; But oft beneath the well-spread Birchen-Tree The Beauties of that Song he made me see. The Lasses oft flung down their Rakes and Pales, And held their Tongues, Oh strange! to hear his Tales. SANDY. Sound be his Sleep, and soft his Waking be; More happy is he far than thee or me: Too good he was for us; the Gods but lent Him here below, when hither he was sent. Let us be good, if Virtue be our Aim, Then we may meet above the Skies again. But see how tow'rds the Glade the Fatlings go; Thomas hath ta'en the Oxen from the Plough; Joan hath prepar'd the Supper 'gainst we come, And late calf'd Cows stand lowing near their Home: Then let's have done, and to our Rest repair, And what we cannot help, with Patience bear. TO Mr. ALLAN RAMSAY, ON HIS Richy and Sandy. By Mr. BURCHET Well fare thee, Allan, who in Mother Tongue, So sweetly hath of breathless Addy sung. His endless Fame thy nat'ral Genius fir'd, And thou hast written as if he inspir'd. Richy and Sandy, who do him survive, Long as thy rural Stanza's last, shall live. The grateful Swains thou'st made, in tuneful Verse, Mourn sadly o'er their late—lost Patron's Hearse. Nor would the Mantuan Bard, if living, blame Thy pious Zeal, or think thou'st hurt his Fame, Since Addison's inimitable Lays Give him an equal Title to the Bays. When he of Armies sang, in lofty Strains, It seem'd as if he in the hostile Plains Had present been. His Pen hath to the Life Trac'd ev'ry Action in the sanguine Strife. In Council now sedate the Chief appears, Then loudly thunders in Bavarian Ears; And still pursuing the destructive Theme, He pushes them into the rapid Stream. Thus beaten out of Blenheim's neighb'ring Fields, The Gallic Gen'ral to the Victor yields, Who, as Britannia's Virgil hath observ'd, From threatn'd Fate all Europe then preserv'd. Nor dost thou, Ramsay, sightless Milton wrong, By ought contain'd in thy melodious Song; For none but Addy could his Thoughts sublime So well unriddle, or his mystick Rhime. And when he deign'd to let his Fancy rove Where Sun-burnt Shepherds to the Nymphs make Love, No one e'er told in softer Notes the Tales Of rural Pleasures in the spangled Vales. So much, Oh Allan! I thy Lines revere, Such Veneration to his Mem'ry bear, That I no longer could my Thanks refrain For what thou'st sung of the lamented Swain. To JOSIAH BURCHET, Esq Thirsting for Fame, at the Pierian Spring The Poet takes a Waught, then seys to sing Nature, and with the tentiest View to hit Her bonny Side with bauldest Turns of Wit. Streams slide in Verse, in Verse the Mountains rise, When Earth turns toom he rummages the Skies, Mounts up beyond them, paints the Fields of Rest, Doups down to visit ilka laigh-land Ghaist. O hartsome Labour! Wordy Time and Pains, That, frae the Best, Esteem and Friendship gains. Be that my Luck, and let the greedy Bike Stock-job the Warld among them as they like. In blyth braid Scots allow me, Sir, to shaw My Gratitude, but Fleetching But is frequently used for without, i. e. without flat'ring. or a Flaw. May Rowth o' Pleasures light upon ye lang, Till to the blest Elysian Bowers ye gang; Wha've clapt my Head sae brawly for my Sang. When honour'd Burchet and his Maiks are pleas'd With my Corn-pipe, up to the Starns I'm heez'd; Whence far I glowr to the Fag-end of Time, And view the Warld delighted wi' my Rhime. That when the Pride of sprush new Words are laid, I like the Classick Authors shall be read. Stand yont proud Czar, I wadna niffer Fame With thee, for a' thy Furrs and paughty Name. If sic great Ferlies, Sir, my Muse can do, As spin a three-plait Praise where it is due, Frae me there's nane deserves it mair than you. Frae me! Frae ilky ane; for sure a Breast Sae gen'rous is of a' that's Good possest. Till I can serve ye mair, I'll wish ye weell, And aft in sparkling Claret drink your Heel: Minding the Mem'ry of the Great and Good Sweet Addison, the Wale of humane Blood, Wha fell, (as Horace anes said to his Billy) Nulli flebilior quam tibi Virgili. SIR, Your's, &amp;c. Al. Ramsay. FAMILIAR EPISTLES BETWEEN Lieutenant William Hamilton and Allan Ramsay. EPISTLE I. Gilbertfield June 26th, 1719. O fam'd and celebrated Allan! Renowned Ramsay, canty Callan, There's nowther Highlandman nor Lawlan, In Poetrie, But may as soon ding down Tamtallan An old Fortification upon the Firth of Forth in East Lothian. As match wi' thee. For ten Times ten, and that's a hunder, I ha'e been made to gaze and wonder, When frae Parnassus thou didst thunder, Wi' Wit and Skill, Wherefore I'll soberly knock under, And quat my Quill. Of Poetry the hail Quintessence Thou hast suck'd up, left nae Excrescence To petty Poets, or sic Messens, Tho round thy Stool, They may pick Crumbs, and lear some Lessons At Ramsay's School. Tho Ben Tho celebrated Ben Johnston. and Dryden of Renown Were yet alive in London Town, Like Kings contending for a Crown; 'Twad be a Pingle, Whilk o' you three wad gar Words sound And best to gingle. Transform'd may I be to a Rat, Wer't in my Pow'r but I'd create Thee upo' sight the Laureat Scots Ramsay press'd hard, and sturdily vaunted, He'd fight for the Laurel before he would want it: But risit Apollo, and cry'd, Peace there old Stile, Your Wit is obscure to one half of the Isle. B. Sess. of Poets. Of this our Age, Since thou may'st fairly claim to that As thy just Wage. Let modern Poets bear the Blame Gin they respect not Ramsay's Name, Wha soon can gar them greet for Shame, To their great Loss; And send them a' right sneaking hame Be Weeping-Cross. Wha bourds wi' thee had need be warry, And lear wi' Skill thy Thrust to parry, When thou consults thy Dictionary Of ancient Words, Which come from thy Poetick Quarry, As sharp as Swords. Now tho I should baith reel and rottle, And be as light as Aristotle, At Ed'nburgh we sall ha'e a Bottle Of reaming Claret, Gin that my haff-pay He held his Commission honourably in my Lord Hyndford's Regiment. And may the Stars wha shine aboon With Honour notice real Merit, Be to my Friend auspicious soon, And cherish ay sae fine a Spirit. Siller Shottle Can safely spare it. At Crambo then we'll rack our Brain, Drown ilk dull Care and aiking Pain, Whilk aften does our Spirits drain Of true Content; Wow, Wow! but we's be wonder fain, When thus acquaint. Wi' Wine we'll gargarize our Craig, Then enter in a lasting League, Free of Ill Aspect or Intrigue, And gin you please it, Like Princes when met at the Hague, We'll solemnize it. Accept of this and look upon it With Favour, tho poor I have done it; Sae I conclude and end my Sonnet, Who am most fully, While I do wear a Hat or Bonnet, Yours—wanton Willy. POSTSCRIPT. By this my Postscript I incline To let you ken my hail Design Of sic a lang imperfect Line, Lyes in this Sentence, To cultivate my dull Ingine By your Acquaintance. Your Answer therefore I expect, And to your Friend you may direct, At Gilbertfield Nigh Glasgow. do not neglect When ye have Leisure, Which I'll embrace with great Respect And perfect Pleasure. ANSWER I. Edinburgh, July 10th, 1719. Sonse fa me, witty, wanton Willy, Gin blyth I was na as a Filly; Not a fow Pint, nor short Hought Gilly, Or Wine that's better, Cou'd please sae meikle, my dear Billy, As thy kind Letter. Before a Lord and eik a Knight, In Gossy Don's be Candle Light, There first I saw't, and ca'd it right, And the maist feck Wha's seen't sinsyne, they ca'd as tight As that on Heck. Ha, heh! thought I, I canna say But I may cock my Nose the Day, When Hamilton the bauld and gay Lends me a Heezy, In Verse that slides sae smooth away, Well tell'd and easy. Sae roos'd by ane of well kend Mettle, Nae sma did my Ambition pettle My canker'd Criticks it will nettle, And e'en sae be't: This Month I'm sure I winna fettle, Sae proud I'm wi't. When I begoud first to cun Verse, And cou'd your Ardry Whins The last Words of Bonny Heck, of which he was Author. rehearse, Where Bonny Heck ran fast and fierce, It warm'd my Breast; Then Emulation did me pierce, Whilk since ne'er ceast. May I be licket wi' a Bittle, Gin of your Numbers I think little; Ye're never rugget, shan, nor kittle, But blyth and gabby, And hit the Spirit to a Title, Of Standart Habby. The Elegy on Habby Simpson Piper of Kilbarchan, a finish'd Piece of its Kind. Ye'll quat your Quill! That were ill-willy, Ye's sing some mair yet, nill ye will ye, O'er meikle Haining wad but spill ye, And gar ye sour, Then up and war them a' yet, Willy, 'Tis in your Power. To knit up Dollers in a Clout, And then to eard them round about, Syne to tell up, they downa lout To lift the Gear; The Malison lights on that Rout, Is plain and clear. The Chiels of London, Cam, and Ox, Ha'e rais'd up great Poetick Stocks Of Rapes, of Buckets, Sarks and Locks, While we neglect To shaw their betters. This provokes Me to reflect On the lear'd Days of Gawn Dunkell, Gawn Douglas Brother to the Earl of Angus Bishop of Dunkell, who besides several original Poems, hath left a most exact Translation of Virgil's Æneis. Our Country then a Tale cou'd tell, Europe had nane mair snack and snell At Verse or Prose; Our Kings James the First and Fifth. were Poets too themsell, Bauld and Jocose. To Ed'nburgh, Sir, when e'er ye come, I'll wait upon ye, there's my Thumb, Were't frae the Gill-bells From Half an Hour before Twelve at Noon, when the Musick Bells begin to play, frequently called the Gill-Bells, from Peoples taking a wheting Dram at that Time. To the Drum, Ten a Clock at Night, when the Drum goes round to warn sober Folks to call for a Bill. to the Drum, And take a Bout, And faith I hope we'll no sit dumb, Nor yet cast out. EPISTLE II. Gilbertfield, July 24th, 1719. Dear Ramsay, When I receiv'd thy kind Epistle, It made me dance, and sing, and whistle; O sic a Fyke, and sic a Fistle I had about it! That e'er was Knight of the Scots Thistle The antient and most noble Order of Knighthood, erected by King Achaius. The ordinary Ensign worn by the Knights of the Order, was a green Ribband, to which was appended a Thistle of Gold crown'd with an imperial Crown, within a Circle of Gold, with this Motto, Nemo me impune lacesset. Sae fain, I doubted. The bonny Lines therein thou sent me, How to the Nines they did content me; Tho', Sir, sae high to compliment me, Ye might defer'd, For had ye but haff well a kent me, Some less wad ser'd. With joyfou Heart beyond Expression, They're safely now in my Possession: O gin I were a Winter-Session Near by thy Lodging, I'd closs attend thy new Profession, Without e'er budging. In even down earnest, there's but few To vie with Ramsay dare avow, In Verse, for to gi'e thee thy due, And without fleetching, Thou's better at that Trade, I trow, Than some's at preaching. This Compliment is intirely free of the fulsome Hyperbole. For my Part, till I'm better leart, To troke with thee I'd best forbear't; For an' the Fouk of Edn'burgh hear't, They'll ca' me daft, I'm unco' irie and Dirt-feart I make wrang Waft. Thy Verses nice as ever nicket, Made me as canty as a Cricket; I ergh to reply, lest I stick it, Syne like a Coof I look, or ane whose Poutch is picket As bare's my Loof. Heh winsom! How thy saft sweet Stile, And bonny auld Words gar me smile; Thou's travel'd sure mony a Mile Wi' Charge and Cost, To learn them thus keep Rank and File, And ken their Post. For I maun tell thee, honest Allie, I use the Freedom so to call thee, I think them a' sae bra and walie, And in sic Order, I wad nae care to be thy Vallie, Or thy Recorder. Has thou with Rosycrucians A People deeply learn'd in the occult Sciences, who convers'd with aerial Beings. Gentlemanny Kind of Necromancers, or so. wandert? Or thro' some doncie Desart danert? That with thy Magick, Town and Landart, For ought I see, Maun a' come truckle to thy Standart Of Poetrie. Do not mistake me, dearest Heart, As if I charg'd thee with black Art; 'Tis thy good Genius still alart, That does inspire Thee with ilk Thing that's quick and smart, To thy Desire. E'en mony a bonny knacky Tale, Bra to set o'er a Pint of Ale: For Fifty Guineas I'll find Bail, Against a Bodle, That I wad quat ilk Day a Mail, For sic a Nodle. And on Condition I were as gabby, As either thee, or honest Habby, That I lin'd a' thy Claes wi' Tabby, Or Velvet Plush, And then thou'd be sae far frae shabby, Thou'd look right sprush. What tho young empty airy Sparks May have their critical Remarks On thir my blyth diverting Warks; 'Tis sma Presumption To say they're but unlearned Clarks, And want the Gumption. Let Coxcomb Criticks get a Tether To ty up a' their lang loose Lether; If they and I chance to forgether, The tane may rue it, For an' they winna had their Blether, They's get a Flewet. To learn them for to peep and pry In secret Drolls 'twixt thee and I; Pray dip thy Pen in Wrath, and cry, And ca' them Skellums, I'm sure thou needs set little by To bide their Bellums. Wi' Writing I'm so bleirt and doited, That when I raise, in Troth I stoited; I thought I shou'd turn capernoited, For wi' a Gird, Upon my Bum I fairly cloited On the cald Eard. Which did oblige a little Dumple Upon my Doup, close by my Rumple: But had ye seen how I did trumple, Ye'd split your Side, Wi' mony a long and weary Wimple, Like Trough of Clyde. ANSWER II. Edinburgh, August 4th, 1719. Dear Hamilton ye'll turn me Dyver, My Muse sae bonny ye descrive her, Ye blaw her sae, I'm fear'd ye rive her, For wi' a Whid, Gin ony higher up ye drive her, She'll rin red-wood. Run distracted.

Accept my third and last Essay Of rural Rhyme, I humbly pray, Bright Ramsay, and altho it may Seem doilt and donsie, Yet thrice of all Things, I heard say Was ay thought sonsie, Wherefore I scarce cou'd sleep or slumber, Till I made up that happy Number, The Pleasure counterpois'd the Cumber, In ev'ry Part, And snoov't away Whirl'd smoothly round. Snooving always expresses the Action of a Top or Spindle, &amp;c. like three Hand Omber, Sixpence a Cart.

Thy blyth and cheerfu' merry Muse, Of Compliments is sae profuse; For my good Haivens dis me roose Sae very finely It were ill Breeding to refuse To thank her kindly. What tho sometimes in angry Mood, When she puts on her Barlick-hood, Her Dialect seem rough and rude; Let's ne'er be flee't, But take our Bit when it is good, And Buffet wi't. For gin we ettle anes to taunt her, And dinna cawmly thole her Banter, She'll take the Flings Turn sullen, restive, and kick.; Verse may grow scanter, Syne wi' great Shame We'll rue the Day that we do want her, Then wha's to blame? But let us still her Kindness culzie, And wi' her never breed a Toulzie, For we'll bring aff but little Spulzie In sic a Barter; And she'll be fair to gar us fulzie, And cry for Quarter.

Then Bacchus like I'd bawl and bluster, And a' the Muses 'bout me muster; Sae merrily I'd squeeze the Cluster, And drink the Grape, 'Twad gi my Verse a brighter Lustre, And better Shape.

A' Blessings, Ramsay, on thee row, All this Verse is a succinct Cluster of kind Wishes, elegantly express'd, with a friendly Spirit, to which I take the Liberty to add Amen. Lang may thou live, and thrive, and dow, Until thou claw an auld Man's Pow; And thro' thy Creed, Be keeped frae the Wirricow After thou's dead. ANSWER III. Edinburgh, September 2d, 1719.

How heartsome is't to see the rising Plants? To hear the Birds chirm o'er their Morning Rants? How tosie is't to snuff the cauller Air, And a' the Sweets it bears, when void of Care? What ails thee, Roger, then? What gars thee grane? Tell me the Cause of thy ill season'd Pain. ROGER. I'm born, O Patie, to a thrawart Fate! I'm born to strive with Hardships dire and great; Tempests may cease to jaw the rowan Flood, Corbies and Tods to grein for Lambkins Blood: But I opprest with never ending Grief, Maun ay despair of lighting on Relief. PATIE. The Bees shall loath the Flower and quite the Hive, The Saughs on boggy Ground shall cease to thrive, E'er scornfou Queans, or Loss of warldly Gear, Shall spill my Rest, or ever force a Tear. ROGER. Sae might I say, but it's nae easy done By ane wha's Saul is sadly out o' Tune: You have sae saft a Voice and slid a Tongue, You are the Darling of baith auld and young. If I but ettle at a Sang, or speak, They dit their Lugs, syn up their Leglens cleek, And jeer me hameward frae the Loan or Bught, While I'm confus'd with mony a vexing Thought: Yet I am tall, and as well shap'd as thee, Nor mair unlikely to a Lasse's Eye: For ilka Sheep ye have I'll number ten, And should, as ane might think, come farrer ben.

May Plenty flow upon thee for a Cross, That thou may'st thole the Pangs of frequent Loss; O may'st thou dote on some fair paughty Wench, Wha ne'er will lout thy lowan Drouth to quench, Till, birs'd beneath the Burden, thou cry Dool, And awn that ane may fret that is nae Fool. PATIE. Sax good fat Lambs, I sald them ilka Cloot At the West-Port The Sheep Market Place of Edinburgh., and bought a winsome Flute, Of Plumb-tree made, with Iv'ry Virles round, A dainty Whistle wi' a pleasant Sound; I'll be mair canty wi't, and ne'er cry Dool, Than you with a your Gear, ye dowie Fool.

Now to your Friend how silly's this Pretence, To ane wha you and a' your Secrets kens: Daft are your Dreams, as daftly wad ye hide Your well-seen Love, and dorty Jenny's Pride. Take Courage, Roger, me your Sorrows tell, And safely think nane kens them but your sell. ROGER. O Patie, ye have ghest indeed o'er true, And there is naething I'll keep up Hide or retain. frae you; Me dorty Jenny looks upon asquint, To speak but till her I dare hardly mint; In ilka Place she jeers me air and late, And gars me look bumbas'd and unco blate, But Yesterday I met her yont a Know, She fled as frae a Shellycoat One of those frightful Spectres the ignorant People are terrified at, and tell us strange Stories of; that they are clothed with a Coat of Shells, which make a horrid rattling, that they'll be sure to destroy one, if he gets not a running Water between him and it; it dares not meddle with a Woman with Child, &amp;c. or Kow; She Bauldy loo's, Bauldy that drives the Car, But gecks at me, and says I smell o' Tar. PATIE. But Bauldy loo's nae her right well I wat, He sighs for Neps;—Sae that may stand for that. ROGER. I wish I cou'd na loo her,—but in vain, I still maun dote and thole her proud Disdain.

E'en do sae, Roger, wha can help Misluck, Saebeins she be sic a thrawn-gabet Chuck; Yonder's a Craig, since ye have tint a' Hope, Gae till't ye'r ways, and take the Lover's Loup. ROGER. I need na make sic Speed my Blood to spill, I'll warrand Death come soon enough a will. PATIE. Daft Gowk! Leave aff that silly whindging Way, Seem careless, there's my Hand ye'll win the Day. Last Morning I was unco airly out, Upon a Dyke I lean'd and glowr'd about; I saw my Meg come linkan o'er the Lee, I saw my Meg, but Maggie saw na me: For yet the Sun was wading throw the Mist, And she was closs upon me e'er she wist. Her Coats were kiltit, and did sweetly shaw Her straight bare Legs, which whiter were than Snaw: Her Cokernony snooded up fou sleek, Her haffet Locks hung waving on her Cheek: Her Cheek sae ruddy! and her Een sae clear! And O! her Mouth's like ony hinny Pear. Neat, neat she was in Bustine Wastecoat clean, As she came skiffing o'er the dewy Green: Blythsome I cry'd, My bonny Meg come here, I fairly wherefore ye'er sae soon a steer: Soon stirring, or up. But now I guess ye'er gawn to gather Dew. She scour'd awa, and said what's that to you? Then fare ye well, Meg Dorts, and e'en 's ye like, I careless cry'd, and lap in o'er the Dyke. I trow, when that she saw, within a crack With a right thieveles Errand she came back; Miscau'd me first,—then bade me hound my Dog To weer up three waff Ews were on the Bog. I leugh, and sae did she, then wi' great Haste I clasp'd my Arms about her Neck and Waste; About her yielding Waste, and took a fouth Of sweetest Kisses frae her glowan Mouth: While hard and fast I held her in my Grips, My very Saul came louping to my Lips. Sair, sair she flete wi' me 'tween ilka Smak, But well I kend she mean'd na as she spak. Dear Roger, when your Jo puts on her Gloom, Do ye sae too, and never fash your Thumb: Be not the least vex'd, be easy. Seem to forsake her, soon she'll change her Mood; Gae woo anither, and she'll gang clean wood. ROGER. Kind Patie, now fair faw your honest Heart, Ye'r ay sae kedgie, and ha'e sick an Art To hearten ane:—For now as clean's a Leek Perfectly claver and right. Ye've cherisht me since ye began to speak: Sae for your Pains I'll make you a Propine, My Mither, honest Wife, has made it fine; A Tartan Plaid, spun of good hauslock Woo, A fine Wool which is pull'd off the Necks of Sheep before the Knife be put in, this being so much gain'd without spoiling the Sale of the Skin, is gather'd for such an Use.

ROGER. As ye advise, I'll promise to observ't, But ye maun keep the Flute, ye best deserv't; Now take it out, and gi'es a bonny Spring, For I'm in tift to hear you play or sing. PATIE. But first we'll take a Turn up to the Hight, And see gin a' our Flocks be feeding right: Be that Time Bannocks and a Shave of Cheese Will make a Breakfast that a Laird might please; Might please our Laird, gin he were but sae wise To season Meat wi' Health instead of Spice: When we ha'e ta'en the Grace-Drink The King's Health, begun first by the religious Margaret Queen of Scots, known by the Name of St. Margaret.

EDINBURGH'S SALUTATION To the Most Honourable, My Lord Marquess of CARNARVON. Eldest Son to his Grace the Duke of Chandois, who in May 1720 was at Edinburgh in his Tour through Scotland. Welcome, my Lord, Heav'n be your Guide, And furder your Intention, To what e'er Place you sail or ride, To brighten your Invention. The Book of Mankind lang and wide Is well worth your Attention: Wherefore please some Time here abide, And measure the Dimension Of Minds right stout. O that ilk worthy British Peer Wad follow your Example, My auld Gray-Head I yet wad rear, And spread my Skirts mair ample. Shou'd London Edinburgh too justly complains that the North of Britain is so remote from the Court, and so rarely enjoys the Influence of British Stars of the first Magnitude. poutch up a' the Gear? She might spare me a Sample: In Trouth his Highness shou'd live here; For without Oyl our Lamp will Gang blinkan out. Lang syne, my Lord, I had a Court, And Nobles fill'd my Cawsy; But since I have been Fortune's Sport, I look nae haff sae gawsy. Yet here brave Gentlemen resort, And mony a handsome Lassy: Now that you're lodg'd within my Port, Fow well I wat they'll a' say, Welcome, my Lord. For you my best Chear I'll produce, I'll no make muckle vaunting; But routh for Pleasure and for Use, Whatever you be wanting, You's have at Will to chap and chuse; For few Things am I scant in; The Wale of well-set Ruby Juice, The most choice of fine clear Claret. When you like to be rantin, I can afford. Than I, nor Paris, nor Madrid, Nor Rome, I trow's mair able To busk you up a better Bed, Or trim a tighter Table. My Sons are honourably bred, To Truth and Friendship stable: What my detracting Faes These who from a malicious low Prejudice (only the Scum indeed of our Neighbours) have falsly reproached us with being rude, unhospitable and false. have said, You'll find a feigned Fable, At the first Sight. May Classic Lear and Letters Belle, And Travelling conspire, Ilk unjust Notion to repell, And God-like Thoughts inspire; That in ilk Action wise and snell You may shaw Manly Fire: Sae the fair Picture of himsell, Will give his Grace your Sire Immense Delight. WEALTH, or the WOODY. A Poem on the SOUTH-SEA. Wrote June 1720. Illi robur &amp; aes triplex Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci Commisit pelago ratem Primus, ? Hor. Daring and unco' stout he was, With Heart hool'd in three Sloughs of Brass, Wha ventur'd first upon the Sea With Hempen Branks, and Horse of Tree. Thalia, ever welcome Thalia the chearful Muse that delights to imitate the Actions of Mankind, and produces the laughing Comedy. . . . That Kind of Poetry ever acceptable to Britons. to this Isle, Descend, and glad the Nation with a Smile; See frae yon Bank where South-Sea ebbs and flows, How Sand-blind Chance Woodies and Wealth bestows: Aided by thee, I'll sail the wondrous Deep, And throw the crowded Alleys cautious creep. Not easy Task to plough the swelling Wave, Or in Stock-jobbing Press my Guts to save: But naething can our wilder Passions tame, Wha rax for Riches or immortal Fame. Long had the Grumblers us'd this murm'ring Sound, Poor Britain in her Publick Debt is drown'd! At fifty Millions late we started a', And wow we wonder'd how the Debt wad fa'; But sonsy Sauls wha first contriv'd the Way, With Project deep our Charges to defray; O'er and aboon it Heaps of Treasure brings, That Fouk be guess become as rich as Kings. Lang Heads they were that first laid down the Plan, Into the which the Round anes headlang ran, Till overstockt, they quat the Sea, and fain wa'd been at Land. Land, in the Time of this Golden two or three Months, was sold at 45, or 50 Years Purchase. Thus when braid Flakes of Snaw have clade the Green, Aften I have young sportive Gilpies seen, The waxing Ba' with meikle Pleasure row, Till past their Pith, it did unwieldy grow. 'Tis strange to think what Changes may appear Within the narrow Circle of a Year. How can ae Project, if it be well laid, Supply the simple Want of trifling Trade! All Manner of Traffick and Mechanicks was at that Time despised. Subscriptions and Transfers were the only Commodities. Saxty lang Years a Man may rack his Brain, Hunt after Gear baith Night and Day wi' Pain, And die at last in Debt, instead of Gain. But O South-Sea! What mortal Mind can run Throw a' the Miracles that thou hast done? Nor scrimply thou thy sell to bounds confines, But like the Sun on ilka Party shines. To Poor and Rich, the Fools as well as Wise, With Hand impartial stretches out the Prize. Like Nilus A River which crosses a great Part of Africa; the Spring-head thereof unknown till of late. In the Month of June it swells and overflows Egypt. When it rises too high, the Innundation is dangerous, and threatens a Famine. In this River are the monstrous amphibious Animals named Crocodiles, of the same Specie with the late Alligators of the South-Sea, which make a Prey of, and devour all humane Creatures they can lay hold on. swelling frae his unkend Head, Frae Bank to Brae o'erflows ilk Rig and Mead, Instilling lib'ral Store of genial Sap, Whence Sun-burn'd Gypsies reap a plenteous Crap: Thus flows our Sea, but with this Diff'rence wide, But anes a Year their River heaves his Tide; Ours aft ilk Day, t'enrich the Common Weal, Bangs o'er its Banks, and dings Ægyptian Nile. Ye Rich and Wise, we own Success your due, But your Reverse Poor Fools. their Luck with Wonder view. How without Thought these dawted Petts of Fate Have jobb'd themselves into sae high a State, By pure Instinct sae leal the Mark have hit, Without the Use of either Fear or Wit. One was reckoned a timorous thinking Fool who took Advice of his Reason in the grand Affair. And ithers wha last Years their Garrets kept, Where Duns in Vision fash'd them while they slept; Wha only durst in Twilight or the Dark, Steal to a common Cook's with haff a Mark, A' their hale Stock.—Now by a kanny Gale, In the o'erflowing Ocean spread their Sail, While they in gilded Galleys cut the Tide, Look down on Fisher Boats Despis'd the virtuous Design of propagating and carrying on a Fishery, which can never fail to be a real Benefit to Britain. wi' meikle Pride. Mean time the Thinkers Many of just Thinking at that Time were vex'd to see themselves trudging on Foot, when some others of very indifferent Capacities were setting up gilded Equipages; and notwithstanding of all the Doubts they formed against it, yet fretted because they were not so lucky as to have some Shares. wha are out of Play, For their ain Comfort kenna what to say; That the Foundation's loose fain wa'd they shaw, And think na but the Fabrick soon will fa'. That's a' but Sham,—for inwardly they fry, Vext that their Fingers were na in the Pye. Faint-hearted Wights, wha dully stood afar, Tholling your Reason great Attempts to mar; While the brave Dauntless, of sic Fetters free, Jumpt headlong Threw off all the Fetters of Reason, and plung'd gloriously into Confusion. glorious in the golden Sea: Where now like Gods they rule each wealthy Jaw, While you may thump your Pows against the Wa'. On Summers E'en the Welkin cawm and fair, When little Midges frisk in lazy Air, Have ye not seen thro' ither how they reel, And Time about how up and down they wheel? Thus Eddies of Stock-jobbers drive about; Upmost to Day, the Morn their Pipe's put out. With pensive Face, when e'er the Market's hy, Minutius crys, Ah! what a Gowk was I. Some Friend of his, wha wisely With Grave Faces many at that Time pretended they could demonstrate this hop'd for Rise of South-Sea. seems to ken Events of Causes mair than ither Men, Push for your Interest yet, Nae Fear, he crys, For South-Sea will to twice ten hunder rise. Waes me for him that sells paternal Land, And buys when Shares the highest Sums demand: He ne'er shall taste the Sweets of rising Stock, Which faws neist Day: Nae Help for't, he is broke. Dear Sea, be tenty how thou flows at Shams Of Hogland Gad'rens The Dutch, whom a learned Author of a late Essay has endeavoured to prove to be descended after a strange Manner from the Gaderens; which Essay Lewis the XIV was mightily pleas'd with, and bounteously rewarded the Author. in their Froggy Dams, Lest in their muddy Boggs thou chance to sink, Where thou may'st stagnate, syne of Course maun stink. This I forsee, (and Time shall prove I'm right; For he's nae Poet wants the second Sight,) When Autumn's Stores are ruck'd up in the Yard, And Sleet and Snaw dreeps down cauld Winter's Beard; When bleak November Winds make Forrests bare, And with splenetick Vapours fill the Air: Then, then in Gardens, Parks, or silent Glen, When Trees bear naething else, they'll carry Men, Wha shall like paughty Romans greatly swing Aboon Earth's Disappointments in a String. Sae ends the towring Saul that downa see A Man move in a higher Sphere than he. Happy that Man wha has thrawn up a Main, Which makes some Hundred thousands a' his ain, And comes to anchor on sae firm a Rock, Britannia's Credit, and the South-Sea Stock. Ilk blythsome Pleasure waits upon his Nod, And his Dependants eye him like a God. Closs may he bend Champain frae E'en to Morn, And look on Cells of Tippony with Scorn. Thrice lucky Pimps, or smug-fac'd wanton Fair, That can in a' his Wealth and Pleasure skair. Like Jove he sits, like Jove, high Heavens Goodman, While the inferiour Gods about him stand, Till he permits with condescending Grace, That ilka ane in Order take their Place. Thus with attentive Look mensfow they sit, Till he speak first, and shaw some shining Wit; Syne circling wheels the flattering Gaffaw, As well they may, he gars their Beards wag a'. Feasts them at his own proper Cost; hence the Proverb, 'Tis fair in Ha', where Beards wag a'. Imperial Gowd, What is't thou canna grant? Possest of thee, What is't a Man needs want? Commanding Coin, there's nathing hard to thee, I canna guess how rich Fowk come to die. Unhappy Wretch, link'd to the threed-bare Nine, The dazling Equipage can ne'er be thine: Destin'd to toil thro' Labyrinths of Verse, Dar'st speak of great Stock-jobbing as a Farce. Poor thoughtless Mortal, vain of airy Dreams, Thy flying Horse, and bright Apollo's Beams, And Helicon's wersh Well thou ca's Divine, Are nathing like a Mistress, Coach and Wine. Wad some good Patron (whase superior Skill Can make the South-Sea ebb and flow at Will,) Put in a Stock for me, I own it fair, In Epick Strain I'd pay him to a Hair; Immortalize him, and what e'er he loves, In flowing Numbers I shall sing, Approves; If not, Fox like, I'll thraw my Gab, and gloom, And ca' your Hundred Thousand a sour Plum. The Fox in the Fable that despised the Plumbs he could not reach, is well known. 100000 Pounds being called a Plumb, make this a right Pun; and some Puns deserve not to be class'd amongst low Wit, tho the Generality of them do. The Prospect of Plenty: A POEM ON THE North-Sea Fishery, Inscribed to the Right Honourable the Royal Burrows of Scotland. ? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ??????. —Opian. Halieutic. Lib. III. Thalia anes again in blythsome Lays, In Lays immortal chant the North-Sea's Praise. Tent how the Caledonians lang supine, Begin, mair wise, to open baith their Een; And as they ought, t'imploy that Store which Heav'n In sic Abundance to their Hands has given. Sae heedless Heir, born to a Lairdship wide, That yields mair Plenty than he kens to guide; Not well acquainted with his ain good Luck, Lets ilka sneaking Fellow take a Pluck; Till at the Lang-run, wi' a Heart right sair, He sees the Bites grow bein, as he grows bare: Then wak'ning, looks about with glegger Glour, And learns to thrive, wha ne'er thought on't before. Nae Nation in the Warld can parallel The plenteous Product of this happy Isle: But Past'ral Heights, and sweet prolifick Plains, That can at Will command the saftest Strains. Stand yont; for Amphitrite The Wife of Neptune. claims our Sang, Wha round fair Thule The Northern Islands of Scotland are allow'd by all to be the Thule of the Antients. drives her finny Thrang, O'er Shaws of Coral, and the Pearly Sands, To Scotia's smoothest Lochs and Christal Strands. There keeps the Tyrant Pike his awfu' Court, Here Trouts and Salmond in clear Channels sport. Wae to that Hand, that dares by Day or Night There are Acts of Parliament, which severely prohibite steeping of Lint, or any other Way defiling these clear Rivers where Salmond abound. Defile the Stream where sporting Fries delight. But Herrings, lovely Fish, like best to play In rowan Ocean, or the open Bay: In Crouds amazing thro the Waves they shine, Millions on Millions form ilk equal Line: Nor dares th'imperial Whale, unless by Stealth, Attack their firm united Common-wealth. But artfu' Nets, and Fishers' wylie Skill, Can bring the scaly Nations to their Will. When these retire to Caverns of the Deep, Or in their oozy Beds thro' Winter sleep, Then shall the tempting Bait, and stented String, Beguile the Cod, the Sea-Cat, Tusk, and Ling. Thus may our Fishery thro' a' the Year Be still imploy'd, t'increase the publick Gear. Delytfou' Labour, where the Industrious gains Profit surmounting ten Times a' his Pains. Nae Pleasure like Success; then Lads stand be, Ye'll find it endless in the Northern-Sea. O'er lang with empty Brag we have been vain Of toom Dominion on the plenteous Main, While others ran away with a' the Gain. Thus proud Iberia Spain. vaunts of sov'reign Sway O'er Countries rich, frae Rise to Set of Day; She grasps the Shadow, but the Substance tines, While a' the rest of Europe milk her Mines. But dawns the Day sets Britain on her Feet, Lang look'd for's come at last, and welcome be't: For numerous Fleets shall hem Æbudan Rocks, The Lews, and other Western Islands. Commanding Seas, with Rowth to raise our Stocks. Nor can this be a toom Chimera found, The Fabrick's bigget on the surest Ground. Sma is our need to toil on foreign Shores, When we have baith the Indies at our Doors. Yet, for Diversion, laden Vessels may To far aff Nations cut the liquid Way; And fraught frae ilka Port what's nice or braw, While for their Trifles we maintain them a'. Goths, Vandals, Gauls, Hesperians, and the Moors, Shall a' be treated frae our happy Shores: The rantin Germans, Russians, and the Poles, Shall feast with Pleasure on our gusty Sholes: For which deep in their Treasures we shall dive: Thus, by fair Trading, North-Sea Stock shall thrive. Sae far the bonny Prospect gave delight, The warm Ideas gart the Muse take Flight: When straight a Grumbletonian appears, Peghing fou sair beneath a Lade of Fears: “Wow! That's braw News, quoth he, to make Fools fain, “But gin ye be nae Warluck, How d'ye ken? “Does Tam the Rhimer Thomas Learmond, alias the Rhimer, liv'd in the Reign of Alexander III. King of Scots, and is held in great Esteem by the Vulgar for his dark Predictions. spae oughtlins of this? “Or do ye prophesy just as ye wish? “Will Projects thrive in this abandon'd Place? “Unsonsy we had ne'er sae meikle Grace. “I fear, I fear, your towring Aim fa' short, “Alake we winn o'er far frae King and Court? “The Southerns will with Pith your Project bauk, “They'll never thole this great Design to tak. Thus do the Dubious ever countermine, With Party wrangle, ilka fair Design. How can a Saul that has the Use of Thought, Be to sic little creeping Fancies brought? Will Britain's King or Parliament gainstand The universal Profit of the Land? Now when nae sep'rate Interest eags to Strife, The antient Nations join'd like Man and Wife, Maun study closs for Peace and Thriving's sake, Aff a' the wissen'd Leaves of Spite to shake: Let's weave and fish to ane anither's Hands, And never mind wha serves or wha commands; But baith alike consult the Common Weal, Happy that Moment Friendship makes us leal To Truth and Right,—Then springs a shining Day, Shall Clouds of sma' Mistakes drive fast away. Mistakes and private Int'rest hence be gane, Mind what ye did on dire Pharsalia's Plain, Where doughty Romans were by Romans slain. A meaner phantom neist, with meikle Dread, Attacks with senseless Fears the weaker Head. “The Dutch, say they, will strive your Plot to stap, “They'll toom their Banks before you reap their Crap: “Lang have they ply'd that Trade like bisy Bees, “And suck'd the Profit of the Pictland Seas, “Thence Riches fish'd mair by themselves confest, “Than e'er they made by India's East and West. O mighty fine, and greatly was it spoke! Maun bauld Britannia bear Batavia's Yoke? May she not open her ain Pantry-door, For fear the paughty State shou'd gi'e a Roar? Dare she nane of her Herrings sel or prive, Afore she say, Dear Matkie wi' ye'r leave? Curse on the Wight wha tholes a Thought sae tame, He merits not the manly Briton's Name. Grant they're good Allies, yet it's hardly wise, To buy their Friendship at sae high a Price. But frae that Airth we needna fear great Skaith, These People, right auldfaran, will be laith To thwart a Nation, wha with Ease can draw Up ilka Sluce they have, and drown them a'. Ah slothfu' Pride! a Kingdom's greatest Curse, How dowf looks Gentry with an empty Purse? How worthless is a poor and haughty Drone, Wha thowless stands a lazy Looker on? While active Sauls a stagnant Life despise, Still ravish'd with new Pleasures as they rise. O'er lang, in Troth, have we By-standers been, And loot Fowk lick the White out of our Een: This Phrase is always applied when People with Pretence of Friendship, do you an ill Turn, as one licking a Mote out of your Eye makes it Bloodshot. Nor can we wyt them, since they had our Vote; But now they'se get the Wistle of their Groat. Here did the Muse intend a while to rest, Till hame o'er spitefu' Din her Lugs opprest; Anither Sett of the envyfou Kind (With narrow Notions horridly confin'd) Wag their boss Noddles; syne with silly Spite Land ilka worthy Project in a Bite. They force with aukward Girn their Ridicule, And ca' ilka ane concern'd a simple Fool, Excepting some, wha a' the leave will nick, And gie them nought but bare Whop-shafts to lick. Malicious Envy! Root of a' Debates, The Plague of Government and Bane of States; The Nurse of positive destructive Strife, Fair Friendship's Fae, which sowrs the Sweets of Life; Promoter of Sedition and base Fead, Still overjoy'd to see a Nation bleed. Stap, stap, my Lass The Muse., forgetna where ye'r gawn, If ye rin on, Heav'n kens where ye may land; Turn to your Fishers Sang, and let Fowk ken The North-Sea Skippers The Managers. are leal-hearted Men, Vers'd in the critick Seasons of the Year, When to ilk Bay the Fishing-Bush should steer; There to hawl up with Joy the plenteous Fry, Which on the Decks in shining Heaps shall ly; Till carefou Hands, even while they've vital Heat, 'Tis a vast Advantage to cure them immediately after they are taken. Shall be employ'd to save their Juices sweet: Strick Tent they'll tak to stow them wi' strang Brine, Foreign Salt. In Barrels tight, that shall nae Liquor tine; Then in the foreign Markets we shall stand With upright Front, and the first Sale demand. This, this our faithfou Trustees have in View, And honourably will the Task Pursue: Nor are they bigging Castles in a Cloud, Their Ships already into Action scud. Several large Ships are already imploy'd, and took in their Salt and Barrels a Month ago. Now, dear ill-naturd Billies, say nae mair, But leave the Matter to their prudent Care: They're Men of Candor, and right well they wate That Truth and Honesty hads lang the Gate: Holds long up its Head, longest keeps the high Way or Gate. Shouder to Shouder let's stand firm and stout, And there's nae Fear but well soon make it out; We've Reason, Law, and Nature on our Side, And have nae Bars, but Party, Slowth, and Pride. When a's in Order, as it soon will be, And Fleets of Bushes fill the Northern-Sea, What hopefou' Images with Joy arise, In Order rang'd before the Muse's Eyes? A Wood of Masts,—well mann'd,—, their jovial Din, Like eydent Bees gawn out and coming in. Here haff a Nation, healthfou, wise, and stark, With Spirits only tint for want of Wark, Shall now find Place their Genius to exert, While in the common Good they act their Part. These, fit for Servitude, shall bear a Hand, And these find Government form'd for Command. Besides, this as a Nursery shall breed Stout skill'd Marines, when Britains Navies need. Pleas'd with their Labour, when their Task is done, They'll leave green Thetis to embrace the Sun: Then freshest Fish shall on the Brander Bleez, And lend the bisy Browster-wife a Heez: While healthfou Hearts shall own their honest Flame, With reaming Quaff, and whomelt to her Name, Whase active Motion to his Heart did reach, As she the Cods was turning on the Beech. The Beech is a Number of big Stones, where they dry the Cod and Ling. Curs'd Poortith, Love, and Hymen's deadly Fae, (Thar gars young Fowk in Prime cry aft, Oh hey, And single live, till Age and Runkles shaw Their canker'd Spirit's good for nought at a';) Now flit your Camp, far frae our Confines scour, Our Lads and Lasses soon shall slight your Power; For Rowth shall cherish Love, and Love shall bring Mae Men t'improve the Soil and serve the King. Thus universal Plenty shall produce Strength to the State, and Arts for Joy and Use. O plenty, thou Delyt of great and sma, Thou nervous Sinnow of baith War and Law: The Statesman's Drift, Spur to the Artist's Skill, Nor does the very Flamens Priests. like thee ill; The shabby Poet hate thee! That's a Lye, Or else they are nae of a Mind wi' me. Plenty shall cultivate ilk Scawp and Moor, Now Lee and bare, because the Landlord's poor. On scroggy Braes shall Akes and Ashes grow, And bonny Gardens clead the brecken How. Does others backward dam the raging Main, The Dutch have gain'd a great Deal from the Sea. Raising on barren Sands a flowry Plain? By us then shou'd the Thought o't be endur'd, To let braid Tracts of Land ly unmanur'd? Uncultivate nae mair they shall appear, But shine with a' the Beauties of the Year; Which start with Ease frae the obedient Soil, And ten Times o'er reward a little Toil. Alang wild Shores, where tumbling Billows break, Plenisht with nought but Shells and Tangle-Wreck, Braw Towns shall rise, with Steeples mony a ane, And Houses bigget a' with Estler Stane: Where Schools polite shall lib'ral Arts display, And make auld barb'rous Darkness fly away. Now Nereus rising frae his watry Bed, The Pearly Drops hap down his lyart Head; Oceanus with Pleasure hears him sing, Tritons and Nereids form a jovial Ring; And dancing on the deep, Attention draw, While a' the Winds in Love, but sighing, blaw. The Sea-born Prophet sang in sweetest Strain, “Britons be blyth, fair Queen of Isles be fain; “A richer People never saw the Sun: “Gang tightly throw what fairly you've begun; “Spread a' your Sails and Streamers in the Wind, “For ilka Power in Sea and Air's your Friend; “Great Neptune's unexhausted Bank has Store “Of endless Wealth, will gar yours a' run o'er.” He sang sae loud, round Rocks the Echoes flew, 'Tis true, he said; they are return'd, 'tis true. September 1720. SCOTS SONGS. Spoken to Mrs. N. A poem wrote without a Thought, By Notes may to a Song be brought, Tho Wit be scarce, low the Design, And Numbers lame in ev'ry Line: But when fair Christy this shall sing In Consort with the trembling String, O then the Poet's often prais'd, For Charms so sweet a Voice hath rais'd. MARY SCOT. Happy's the love which meets Return, When in soft Flames Souls equal burn; But Words are wanting to discover Torments of a hopeless Lover. Ye Registers of Heav'n relate, If looking o'er the Rolls of Fate, Did you there see mark'd for my Marrow Mary Scot the Flower of Yarrow. Ah no! Her Form's too heavenly fair, Her Love the Gods above must share, While Mortals with Despair explore her, And at Distance due adore her. O lovely Maid! my Doubts beguile, Revive and bless me with a Smile; Alace! if not, you'll soon debar a Sighing Swain the Banks of Yarrow. Be hush ye Fears, I'll not despair, My Mary's tender as she's fair; Then I'll go tell her all mine Anguish; She is too good to let me languish; With Success crown'd I'll not envy The Folks who dwell above the Sky, When Mary Scot's become my Marrow, We'll make a Paradice on Yarrow. O'er BOGIE. I will awa' wi my Love, I will awa' wi' her, Tho a' my Kin had sworn and said, I'll o'er Bogie wi' her. If I can get but her Consent, I dinna care a Strae, Tho ilka ane be discontent, Awa' wi' her I'll gae. I will awa', &amp;c. For now she's Mistress of my Heart, And wordy of my Hand, And well I wat we shanna part, For Siller or for Land. Let Rakes delyte to swear and drink, And Beaus admire fine Lace, But my chief Pleasure is to blink On Betty's bonny Face. I will awa', &amp;c. There a' the Beauties do combine Of Colour, Treats and Air, The Saul that sparkles in her Een Makes her a Jewel rare; Her flowing Wit gives shining Life To a' her other Charms, How blest I'll be when she's my Wife, And lockt up in my Arms. I will awa', &amp;c. There blythly will I rant and sing, While o'er her Sweets I range, I'll cry, Your humble Servant King, Shamefa' them that wa'd change A Kiss of Betty and a Smile, Abeet ye wa'd lay down The Right ye ha'e to Britain's Isle, And offer me ye'r Crown. I will awa', &amp;c. O'er the Moor to MAGGY. And I'll o'er the Moor to Maggy, Her Wit and Sweetness call me, Then to my Fair I'll show my Mind, Whatever may befal me. If she love Mirth, I'll learn to sing, Or likes the Nine to follow, I'll lay my Lugs in Pindus' Spring, And invocate Apollo. If she admire a martial Mind, I'll sheath my Limbs in Armour; If to the softer Dance inclin'd, With gayest Airs I'll charm her; If she love Grandeur, Day and Night I'll plot my Nations Glory. Find Favour in my Prince's Sight, And shine in future Story. Beauty can Wonders work with Ease, Where Wit is corresponding, And bravest Men know best to please, With Complaisance abounding. My bonny Maggy's Love can turn Me to what Shape she pleases, If in her Breast that Flame shall burn Which in my Bosom bleezes. I'll never leave Thee. JONNY. Tho' for seven Years and mair Honour shou'd reave me, To Fields where Cannons rair, thou need na grieve thee; For deep in my Spirit thy Sweets are indented, And love shall preserve ay what Love has imprinted. Leave thee, leave thee, I'll never leave thee, Gang the World as it will, Dearest believe me. NELLY. O Jonny I'm jealous, when e'er ye discover My Sentiments yielding, ye'll turn a loose Rover; And nought i' the Warld wa'd vex my Heart sairer, If you prove unconstant, and fancy ane fairer. Grieve me, grieve me, Oh it wad grieve me! A' the lang Night and Day, if you deceive me. JONNY. My Nelly let never sic Fancies oppress ye, For while my Blood's warm I'll kindly caress ye, Your blooming saft Beauties first beeted Love's Fire, Your Virtue and Wit make it ay flame the hyer: Leave thee, leave thee, I'll never leave thee, Gang the Warld as it will, Dearest believe me. NELLY. Then Jonny I frankly this Minute allow ye To think me your Mistress, for Love gars me trow ye, And gin ye prove fa'se, to ye'r sel be it said then, Ye'll win but sma' Honour to wrang a kind Maiden. Reave me, reave me, Heav'ns! it wad reave me, Of my Rest Night and Day, if ye deceive me. JONNY. Bid Iceshogles hammer red Gauds on the Study, And fair Simmer Mornings nae mair appear ruddy; Bid Britons think ae Gate, and when they obey ye, But never till that Time, believe I'll betray ye: Leave thee, leave thee, I'll never leave thee; The Starns shall gang withershins e'er I deceive thee. Polwart on the Green. At Polwart on the Green If you'll meet me the Morn, Where Lasses de conveen To dance about the Thorn; A kindly Welcome you shall meet Frae her wha likes to view A Lover and a Lad complete, The Lad and Lover you. Let dorty Dames say Na, As lang as e'er they please, Seem caulder than the Sna', While inwardly they bleeze; But I will frankly shaw my Mind, And yield my Heart to thee; Be ever to the Captive kind, That langs na to be free. At Polwart on the Green, Among the new mawn Hay, With Sangs and Dancing keen We'll pass the heartsome Day, At Night if Beds be o'er thrang laid, And thou be twin'd of thine, Thou shalt be welcome, my dear Lad, To take a Part of mine. JOHN HAY'S Bonny Lassie. By smooth winding Tay a Swain was reclining, Aft cry'd he, Oh hey! Maun I still live pining My sell thus away, and darna discover To my bonny Hay that I am her Lover. Nae mair it will hide, the Flame waxes stranger, If she's not my Bride, my Days are nae langer; Then I'll take a Heart, and try at a Venture, May be e'er we part my Vows may content her. She's fresh as the Spring, and sweet as Aurora, When Birds mount and sing bidding Day a Good-morrow. The Sward of the Mead enamel'd with Daisies, Look wither'd and dead when twin'd of her Graces. But if she appear where Verdures invite her, The Fountains run clear, and Flowers smell the Sweeter, 'Tis Heav'n to be by, when her Wit is a flowing, Her Smiles and bright Eye set my Spirits a glowing. The mair that I gaze, the deeper I'm wounded, Struck dumb with Amaze, my Mind is confounded; I'm all in a Fire, dear Maid, to caress ye, For a' my Desire is Hay's bonny Lassie. Genty Tibby and Sonsy Nelly. To the Tune of Tibby Fowler in the Glen. Tibby has a Store of Charms, Her genty Shape our Fancy warms, How starkly can her sma' white Arms Fetter the Lad wha looks but at her; Frae Ancle to her slender Waste, These Sweets conceal'd invite to dawt her, Her rosie Cheek and rising Breast, Gar ane's Mouth gush bowt fou' o' Water. Nelly's gawsy, saft and gay, Fresh as the lucken Flowers in May, Ilk ane that sees her cries Ah hey! She's bonny, O I wonder at her! The Dimples of her Chin and Cheek, And Limbs sae plump invite to dawt her, Her Lips sae sweet, and Skin sae sleek, Gar mony Mouths beside mine water. Now strike my Finger in a Bore, My Wyson with the Maiden shore, Gin I can tell whilk I am for When these twa Stars appear thegether. O Love! Why dost thou gi'e thy Fires Sae large? while we're oblig'd to nither Our spacious Sauls immense Desires, And ay be in a hankerin Swither. Tibby's Shape and Airs are fine, And Nelly's Beauties are divine; But since they canna baith be mine, Ye Gods give Ear to my Petition, Provide a good Lad for the tane, But let it be with this Provision, I get the other to my lane, In Prospect plano and Fruition. Up in the Air. Now the Sun's gane out o' Sight, Beet the Ingle, and snuff the Light: In Glens the Fairies skip and dance, And Witches wallop o'er to France, Up in the Air On my bonny grey Mare. And I see her yet, and I see her yet, Up in, &amp;c. The Wind's drifting Hail and Sna' O'er frozen Hags like a Foot Ba', Nae Starns keek throw the Azure Slit, 'Tis cauld and mirk as ony Pit, The Man i' the Moon Is carowsing aboon, D'ye see, d'ye see, d'ye see him yet. The Man, &amp;c. Take your Glass to clear your Een, 'Tis the Elixir hales the Spleen, Baith Wit and Mirth it will inspire, And gently puffs the Lover's Fire, Up in the Air, It drives away Care, Ha'e wi' ye, ha'e wi' ye, and ha'e wi' ye Lads yet, Up in, &amp;c. Steek the Doors, keep out the Frost, Come Willy gi'es about ye'r Tost, Til't Lads, and lilt it out, And let us ha'e a blythsom Bowt, Up wi't there, there, Dinna cheat, but drink fair, Huzza, Huzza, and Huzza Lads yet, Up wi't, &amp;c. THE RISE and FALL OF STOCKS, 1720. An Epistle to the Right Honourable my Lord Ramsay, now in Paris. Your Pettifoggers damn their Souls! To share with Knaves in cheating Fools, And Merchants vent'ring on the Main Slight Pirates, Rocks, and Horns for Gain. Hudibras. My Lord, Withoutten Preface or Preamble, My Fancy being on the Ramble; Transported with an honest Passion, Viewing our poor bambouzl'd Nation, Biting her Nails, her Knuckles wringing, Her Cheek sae blae, her Lip sae hinging; Grief and Vexation's like to kill her, For tyning baith her Tick and Siller. Allow me then to make a Comment On this Affair of greatest Moment Which has fa'n out, my Lord, since ye Left Lothian and the Edge-well Tree: An Oak Tree which grows on the Side of a fine Spring, nigh the Castle of Dalhousie, very much observed by the Country People, who give out, that before any of the Family died, a Branch fell from the Edge-well Tree. The old Tree some few Years ago fell altogether, but another sprung from the same Root, which is now tall and flourishing, and lang be't sae. And, with your Leave, I needna stickle To say we're in a sorry Pickle, Since Poortith o'er ilk Head does hover Frae John a Groat's House The Northmost House in Scotland., South to Dover. Sair have we pelted been with Stocks, Casting our Credit at the Cocks. Lang guilty of the highest Treason Against the Government of Reason; We madly at our ain Expences, Stock-job'd away our Cash and Senses. As little Bairns frae Winnocks hy Drap down Saip Bells to waiting Fry, Wha run and wrestle for the Prize, With Face erect and watchfou' Eyes; The Lad wha gleggest waits upon it, Receives the Bubble on his Bonnet, Views with Delight the shining Beau-thing, Which in a Twinkling bursts to Nothing. Sae Britain brought on a' her Troubles, By running daftly after Bubles. Impos'd on by langnebit Juglers, Stock-Jobbers, Brokers, cheating Smuglers, Wha set their Gowden Girns sae wylie, Tho ne'er sae cautious they'd beguile ye. The covetous Infatuation Was smittle out o'er a' the Nation, Clergy and Lawyers and Physicians, Mechanicks, Merchants, and Musicians; Baith Sexes of a' Sorts and Sizes Drap'd ilk Design and jobb'd for Prizes. Frae Noblemen to Livery Varlets, Frae topping Toasts to Hackney Harlots. Poetick Dealers were but scarce, Less browden still on Cash than Verse; Only ae Bard to Coach did mount Vide Dick Franklin's Epistle. By singing Praise to Sir John Blount; But since his mighty Patron fell, He looks just like Jock Blunt This is commonly said of a Person who is out of Countenance at a Disapointment. himsel. Some Lords and Lairds sell'd Riggs and Castles, And play'd them aff with tricky Rascals, Wha now with Routh of Riches vapour, While their late Honours live on Paper. But ah! the Difference 'twixt good Land, And a poor Bankrupt Bubble's Band. Thus Europeans Indians rifle, And give them for their Gowd some Trifle; As Deugs of Velvet, Chips of Christal, A Falcon's Bell, or Baubie Whistle. Merchants and Bankers Heads gade wrang, They thought to Millions they might spang; Despis'd the virtuous Road to Gain, And look'd on little Bills with Pain: The well win Thousands of some Years, In ae big Bargain disappears. 'Tis sair to bide, but wha can help it, Instead of Coach, on Foot they skelp it. The Ten per Cents wha durstna venture, But lent great Sums upon Indenture, To Billies wha as frankly war'd it, As they out of their Guts had spar'd it, When craving Money they have lent, They're answer'd, Item, A' is spent. The Miser hears him with a Gloom, Girns like a Brock and bites his Thumb, Syne shores to grip him by the Wyson, And keep him a' his Days in Prison. Sae may ye do, replies the Debter, But that can never mend the Matter: As soon can I mount Charle-wain, As pay ye back your Gear again. Poor Mouldy rins quite by himsel, Mad, out of his Wits. And bans like ane broke loose frae Hell. It lulls a wee my Mullygrubs, To think upon these bitten Scrubs, When naething saves their vital Low, But the Expences of a Tow. Thus Children oft with carefu' Hands, In Summer dam up little Strands, Collect the Drizel to a Pool, In which their glowing Limbs they cool; Till by comes some ill-deedy Gift, A Rogish Boy, who is seldom without doing a bad Action. Wha in the Bulwark makes a Rift, And with ae Strake in Ruins lays, The work of Use, Art, Care and Days. Even Handy-crafts-men too turn'd saucy, And maun be Coaching't thro' the Causy; Syne stroot fou paughty in the Alley, Transferring Thousands with some Valley: Grow rich in Fancy, treat their Whore, Nor mind they were, or shall be poor. Like little Joves they treat the Fair, With Gowd frae Banks built in the Air; For which their Danaes Danae the Daughter of Acrisius King of Argos, to whom Jupiter descended in a Shower of Gold. lift the Lap, And compliment them with a Clap, Which by aft jobbing grows a Pox, Till Brigs of Noses fa' with Stocks. Here Coachmen, Grooms, or Pasment Trotter, Glitter'd a while, then turn'd to Snoter: Like a shot Starn, that thro' the Air Skyts East or West with unko Glare, But found neist Day on Hillock Side, Nae better seems nor Paddock Ride. Some Reverend Brethren left their Flocks, And sank their Stipends in the Stocks; But tining baith, like Æsop's Colly, O'er late they now lament their Folly. For three warm Months, May, June, and July, There was odd scrambling for the Spulzy; And mony a ane, till he grew tyr'd, Gather'd what Gear his Heart desir'd. We thought that Dealer's Stock an ill ane, That was not wordy haf a Million. O had this Golden Age but lasted, And no sae soon been broke and blasted, There is a Person well I ken Meaning my self, with Regard to my printing this Volume by Subscription. Might wi' the best gane right far ben; His Project better had succeeded, And far less Labour had he needed: But 'tis a Daffin to debate, And aurgle-bargain with our Fate. Well, had this Gowden Age but lasted, And no so soon been broke and blasted, O wow, my Lord, these had been Days Which might have claim'd your Poet's Lays; But soon alake! the mighty Dagon Was seen to fa' without a Rag on. In Harvest was a dreadfu' Thunder, Which gart a' Britain glowr and wonder; The phizzing Bowt came with a Blatter, And dry'd our great Sea to a Gutter. But mony Fowk with Wonder speir, What can become of a' the Gear? For a' the Country is repining, And ilka ane complains of tining. Plain Answer I had best let be, And tell ye just a Similie. Like Belzie when he nicks a Witch Wha sells her Sauls she may be rich; He finding this the Bait to damn her, Casts o'er her Een his cheating Glamour: She signs and seals, and he affords Her Heaps of visionary Hoords; But when she comes to count the Cunzie, 'Tis a' Sklate-stanes instead of Money. Thus we've been trick'd with braw Projectors, And faithfu' managing Directors, Wha for our Cash, the Saul of Trade, Bonny Propines of Paper made; On footing clean, drawn unco' fair, Had they not vanisht into Air. When South-Sea Tyde was at a Hight, My Fancy took a daring Flight, Wealth or the Woody, wrote in the Month of June last. Thalia, lovely Muse, inspired My Breast, and me with Fore-sight fired; Rapt into future Months, I sa' The rich Aerial Babel fa'. 'Yond Seas I saw the Upstarts drifting, Leaving their Coaches for the lifting. These Houses fit for Wights gane mad, I saw cramm'd fou as they cou'd had; While little Sauls sunk with Despair, Implor'd cauld Death to end their Care. But now a sweeter Scene I view, Time has, and Time shall prove I'm true; For fair Astrea moves frae Heav'n, And shortly shall make a' Odds Ev'n. The honest Man shall be regarded, And Villains as they ought rewarded. The setting Moon and rosie Dawn Bespeak a shining Day at Hand; A glorious Sun shall soon arise, To brighten up Britannia's Skies. Our King and Senate shall engage To drive the Vultures off the Stage: Trade then shall flourish, and ilk Art, A lively Vigour shall impart To Credit languishing and famisht, And Lombard-street shall be replenisht. Got safe ashore after this Blast, Britons shall smile at Follies past. God grant your Lordship Joy and Health, Lang Days and Rowth of real Wealth; Safe to the Land of Cakes Heav'n send ye, And frae cross Accidents defend ye. Edinb. March 25, 1721.

PROLOGUE. Spoke by one of the young Gentlemen, who, for their Improvement and Diversion, acted The Orphan, and Cheats of Scapin, the last Night of the year 1719. Braw Lads, and bonny Lasses, welcome here,— But wha's to entertain ye,—never speer.— Quietness is best.—Tho we be leal and true, Good Sense and Wit's mair than we dare avow.— Some Body says to some Fowk, We're to blame, That 'tis a Scandal and black-burning Shame To thole young Callands thus to grow sae snack, And lear—O mighty Crimes!—to speak and act.— Stage-Plays, quoth Dunce, are unco' Things indeed! He said,—he gloom'd,—and shook his thick boss Head. They're Papery, Papery!—cry'd his Nibour neist, Contriv'd at Rome by some malignant Priest, To witch away Fowks Minds frae doing well, As saith Rab Ker One who puts the canting Phrase of M'Millan and M'Neil (two nonconforming Hill Preachers) into wretched Rhime., M'Millan and M'Neil. But let them tauk.—In Spite of ilk Cadaver, We'll cherish Wit, and scorn their Fead or Favour; We'll strive to bring in active Eloquence, Tho for a while upon our Fame's Expence.— I'm wrang.—Our Fame will mount with metled Carles, And for the rest, we'll be aboon their Snarls.— Knock down the Fools, wha dare with empty Rage Spit in the Face of Virtue and the Stage. 'Cause Hereticks in Pulpits thump and rair, Must naithing orthodox b' expected there; Because a Rump cut off a Royal Head, Must not anither Parli'ment succeed. Thus tho the Drama's aft debauch'd and rude, Must we, for some are bad, refuse the good: Answer me that,—If there be ony Log, That's come to keek upon us here incog, Anes,—Twice, Thrice.—But now I think on't, stay, I've something else to do, and must away.— This Prologue was design'd for Use and Sport, The Chiel that made it, let him answer for't.

CUPID thrown into the South-Sea. Myrtilla, as like Venus' sell As e'er an Egg was like anither, Anes Cupid met upon the Mall, And took her for his bonny Mither. He wing'd his Way up to her Breast; She started, he cry'd, Mam 'tis me; The Beauty, in o'er rash a Jest, Flang the Arch-Gytling in South-Sea. Frae thence he raise wi' guilded wings, His Bow and Shafts to Gowd were chang'd; Deel's i' the Sea, quoth he, it dings; Syne back to Mall and Park he rang'd. Breathing Mischief, the God look'd gurly, With Transfers a' his Darts were feather'd; He made a horrid hurly burly, Where Beaus and Belles were thickest gather'd. He tentily Myrtilla sought, And in the thrang Change-Alley got her; He drew his Bow, and quick as Thought With a braw new Subscription shot her. THE SATYR'S COMICK PROJECT For recovering A young Bankrupt Stock-jobber. A SONG. On the Shore of a low ebbing Sea, From the Beginning to the 20th Line, sing to the Tune of Colin's Complaint. A sighing young Jobber was seen Staring wishfully at an old Tree Which grew on the neighbouring Green. There's a Tree that can finish the Strife And Disorder that warrs in my Breast, What need one be pain'd with his Life, When a Halter can purchase him rest? Sometimes he would stamp and look wild, Then roar out a terrible Curse On Bubbles that had him beguil'd, And left ne'er a Doit in his Purse. A Satyr that wander'd along, With a Laugh to his Raving reply'd; The Savage maliciously sung, And jock'd while the Stockjobber cry'd. To Mountains and Rocks he complain'd, His Cravat was bath'd with his Tears; The Satyr drew near like a Friend, And bid him abandon his Fears. Said he, Have ye been at the Sea, From the 21st Line, where the Satyr begins to speak to the Tune of The Kirk wad let me be. And met with a contrary Wind, That you rail at fair Fortune so free, Don't blame the poor Goddess she's blind. Come hold up thy Head foolish Wight, I'll teach thee the Loss to retrieve; Observe me this Project aright, And think not of hanging, but live. Hecatissa conceited and old, Affects in her Airs to seem young, Her Joynture yields Plenty of Gold, And Plenty of Nonsense her Tongue. Lay Siege to her for a short Space, Ne'er mind that she's wrinkl'd or grey; Extoll her for Beauty and Grace, And doubt not of gaining the Day. In Wedlock ye fairly may join, And when of her Wealth you are sure, Make free with the old Woman's Coin, And purchase a sprightly young W?. TO THE MUSICK CLUB. E'er on old Shinar's Plain the Fortress rose, Rear'd by those Giants who durst Heav'n oppose; An universal Language Mankind us'd, 'Till daring Crimes brought Accents more confus'd; Discord and Jar for Punishment were hurl'd On Hearts and Tongues of the rebellious World. The primar Speech with Notes harmonious clear, Transposing Thought, gave Pleasure to the Ear: Then Musick in its full Perfection shin'd, When Man to Man melodious spoke his Mind. As when a richly fraughted Fleet is lost In rolling Deeps, far from the ebbing Coast, Down many Fathoms of the liquid Mass, The Artist dives in Ark of Oak, or Brass, Snatches some Ingots of Peruvian Ore, And with his Prize rejoycing makes the Shore. Oft this Attempt is made, and much they find: They swell in Wealth, tho much is left behind. Amphion's Sons, with Minds elate and bright, Thus plunge th'unbounded Ocean of Delight, And daily gain new Stores of pleasing Sounds To glad the Earth, fixing to Spleen its Bounds; While vocal Tubes and consort Strings engage To speak the Dialect of the Golden Age. Then you whose Symphony of Souls proclaim Your Kin to Heaven, add to your Country's Fame, And shew that Musick may have as good Fate In Albion's Glens, as Umbria's green Retreat: And with Correlli's soft Italian Song Mix Cowdon Knows, and Winter Nights are long. Nor should the Martial Pibrough be despis'd, Own'd and refin'd by you, these shall the more be priz'd. Each ravisht Ear extolls your Heavenly Art, Which sooths our Care, and elevates the Heart, Whilst hoarser Sounds the martial Ardures move, And liquid Notes invite to Shades and Love. Hail safe Restorer of distemper'd Minds, That with Delight the raging Passion binds: Extatick Concord only banisht Hell, Most perfect where the perfect Beings dwell. Long may our Youth attend thy charming Rites, Long may they relish thy transporting Sweets. Wine and Musick, an ODE. SYMON. O Colin how dull is't to be, When a Soul is sinking wi' Pain, To one who is pained like me: My Life's grown a Load, And my Faculties nod, While I sigh for cold Jeanie in vain; By Beauty and Scorn I'm slain: The Wound it is mortal and deep, My Pulses beat low in each Vein, And threaten eternal Sleep. COLIN. Come here are the best Cures for thy Wounds, O Boy, the cordial Bowl! With soft harmonious Sounds, Wounds, these can cure all Wounds, With soft harmonious Sounds, And pull off the cordial Bowl: O Symon, sink thy Care, and tune up thy drooping Soul; Above, the Gods bienly bouze, When round they meet in a Ring; They cast away Care, and carouse Their Nectar, while they sing. Then drink and chearfully sing, These make the Blood circle fine; Strike up the Musick, The safest Physick, Compounded with sparkling Wine. ON The Great Eclipse OF THE SUN, The 22d April, nine a Clock of the Morning, wrote a Month before it hapned, March 1715. N.B. The Order of Time in placing some of my Manuscript Poems, with Regard to them formerly printed, is not observed in some few of the following, but their Dates shall be given. Now do I press among the learned Throng, To tell a great Eclipse in little Song. At me nor Scheme, nor Demonstration ask, That is our Gregory's Mr. Gregory Professor of Mathematicks in Edinburgh. Famed Hally Fellow of the Royal Society, London., or fam'd Hally's Task: 'Tis they who are conversant with each Star, Who knows how Planets Planets Rays debar. This to pretend my Muse is not so bold, She only echoes what she has been told. Our rolling Globe According to the Capernicon System. will scarce have made the Sun Seem half way up Olympus to have run, When Night's pale Queen in her oft changed Way, Will intercept in direct Line his Way, And make black Night usurp the Throne of Day. The curious will attend that Hour with Care, And wish no Clouds may hover in the Air, To dark the Medium, and obstruct from Sight The gradual Motion and Decay of Light, Whilst thoughtless Fools will view the Water Pale, To see which of the Planets will prevail: For then they think the Sun and Moon make War, Thus Nurses Tales oftimes the Judgment mar. When this strange Darkness overshades the Plains, 'Twill give an odd Surprise t'unwarned Swains, Plain honest Hinds, who do not know the Cause, Nor know of Orbs, their Motions or their Laws, Will from the half plough'd Furrows homeward bend, In dire Confusion, judging that the End Of Time approacheth; thus possest with Fear, They'll think the general Conflagration near. The Traveler benighted on the Road Will turn devout, and supplicate his God. Cocks with their careful Mates and younger Fry, As if't were Evening, to their Roosts will fly. The horned Cattle will forget to feed, And come home lowing from the grassie Mead. Each Bird of Day will to his Nest repair, And leave to Bats and Owls the dusky Air. The Lark and little Robin's softer Lay Will not be heard till the Return of Day. Now this will be great Part of Europe's Case, While Phebe's as a Mask on Phœbus' Face. The unlearn'd Clowns, who don't our Æra know, From this dark Friday will their Ages show; As I have often heard old Country Men Talk of dark Munday, and their Ages then. Not long shall last this strange uncommon Gloom When Light dispels the Ploughman's Fear of Doom; With merry Heart he'll lift his ravish'd Sight Up to the Heavens, and welcome back the Light. How just's the Motions of these whirling Spheres! Which ne'er can err while Time is met by Years. How vast is little Man's capacious Soul! That knows how Orbs throw Weilds of Æther roll. How great's the Power of that Omnifick Hand! Who gave them Motion by his wise Command, That they should not while Time had Being stand. The Gentleman's Qualifications, as debated by some of the Fellows of the Easy Club A juvenile Society, of which I am a Fellow, from the general Antipathy we all seem'd to have at the ill Humor and Contradictions which arise from Trifles, especially those which constitute Whig and Tory, without having the grand Reason for it; this engaged us to take a Pleasure in the Sound of an Easy Club. This Club, by one of our special Laws, must not exceed Twelve, and any Gentleman at his Admission was to take the Name of some Scots Author, or one eminent for something extraordinary, for obscuring his real Name in the Register of our Lucubrations, such as are nam'd in this Debate, Tippermaloch, Buchanan, Hector Boece, &amp;c., April 1715. From different Ways of Thinking comes debate, This we despise, and That we over-rate, Just as the Fancy takes, we love or hate. Hence Whig and Tory live in endless Jarr, And most of Families in Civil War: Hence 'mongst the easiest Men beneath the Skies, Even in their easy Dome, Debates arise: As late they did with Strength of Judgment scan These Qualities that form a Gentleman. First Tippermaloch pled with Spanish Grace That Gentry only sprung from antient Race, Whose Names in old Records of Time were fix'd, In whose rich Veins some royal Blood was mixt. I being a Poet sprung from a Douglass' Loin, In this proud Thought did with the Doctor join; With this Addition, if they could speak Sense, Ambitious I, ah! had no more Pretence. Buchanan, with stiff Argument and bold, Pled Gentry took its Birth from powerful Gold. Him Hector Boece join'd, they argued strong, Said they, to Wealth that Title must belong; If Men are rich, they're gentle, and if not You'll own their Birth and Sense are soon forgot. Pray say, said they, How much respectful Grace Demands an old red Coat and mangled Face? Or one, if he could like an Angel preach, If he to no rich Benefice can reach? Ev'n Progeny of Dukes are at a Stand How to make out bare Gentry without Land. But still the Doctor would not quit the Field, But that rich Upstarts should to Birth-right yeild; He grew more stiff, nor would the Plea let go, Said he was right, and swore it should be so. But happy we, who have such wholsome Laws, Which without Pleading can decide a Cause. To this good Law Recourse we had at last, That throws off Wrath, and makes our Friendship fast; In which the Legislators laid the Plot, To end all Controversy by a Vote. Yet that we more good Humor might display, We frankly turn'd the Vote another Way, As in each Thing we common Topicks shun, So great the Prize, nor Birth nor Riches won. The Vote was carried thus, That easy he Who should three Years a social Fellow be, And to our Easy Club give no Offence, After Triennial Tryal, should commence A Gentleman, which gives as just a Claim To that great Title, as the Blast of Fame Can give to them who trade in humane Gore, Or those who heap up Hoords of coined Ore; Since in our social Friendship nought's design'd But what may raise and brighten up the Mind; We aiming closs to walk by Virtue's Rules, To find true Honour's self, and leave her Shade to Fools. On WIT. My easy Friends, since ye think fit This Night to lucubrate on Wit; And since ye judge that I compose Being but an indifferent Sort of an Orator, my Friends would merrily alledge that I was not so happy in Prose as Rhime; it was carried in a Vote, against which there is no Opposition, and the Night appointed for some Lessons on Wit, I was ordered to give my Thoughts in Verse. My Thoughts in Rhime better than Prose, I'll give my Judgment in a Sang, And here it comes be't right or wrang. But first of a' I'll tell a Tale That with my Case runs paralel. There was a manting Lad in Fife, Wha cou'd na for his very Life Speak without stammering very lang, Yet never manted when he sang. His Father's Kiln he anes saw burning, Which gart the Lad run Breathless mourning; Hameward with cliver Strides he lap, To tell his Dady his Mishap. At Distance e'er he reach'd the Door, He stood and rais'd a hideous Roar. His Father when he heard his Voice, Stept out and said, Why a' this Noise? The Calland gap'd and glowr'd about, But no ae Word could he lug out: His Dad cry'd, kening his Defect, Sing, sing, or I shall break your Neck. Then soon he gratifi'd his Sire, And sang aloud, Your Kiln's a Fire. Now ye'll allow there's Wit in that, To tell a Tale sae very pat. Bright Wit appears in mony a Shape, Which some invent and others ape. Some shaw their Wit in wearing Claiths, And some in coining of new Aiths; There's crambo Wit in making Rhime, And dancing Wit in beating Time: There's metl'd Wit in Story-telling, In writing Grammar, and right spelling: Wit shines in Knowledge of Politicks, And wow! what Wit's amang the Criticks. So far my Mates excuse me while I play In Strains ironick with that heavenly Ray, Rays which the humane Intelects refine, And makes the Man with brill[i]ant Lustre shine, Marking him sprung from Origine divine. Yet may a well rig'd Ship be full of Flaws, So may loose Wits regard no sacred Laws: That Ship the Waves will soon to Pieces shake, So 'midst his Vices sinks the witty Rake. But when on First-rate-virtues Wit attends, It both itself and Virtue recommends, And challenges Respect where e'er its Blaze extends. ON FRIENDSHIP. The Earth-born Clod who hugs his Idol Pelf, His only Friends are Mammon and himself: The drunken Sots, who want the Art to think, Still cease from Friendship when they cease from Drink. The empty Fop, who scarce for Man will pass, Ne'er sees a Friend but when he views his Glass. Friendship first springs from Sympathy of Mind, Which to complete the Virtues all combine, And only found 'mongst Men who can espy, The Merits of his Friend without Envy. Thus all pretending Friendship's but a Dream, Whose Base is not reciprocal Esteem. KEITHA: A PASTORAL, Lamenting the Death of the Right Honourable MARY Countess of Wigtoun. RINGAN. O'er ilka Thing a gen'ral Sadness hings! The Burds wi' Melancholy droop their Wings; My Sheep and Kye neglect to moup their Food, And seem to think as in a dumpish Mood. Hark how the Winds souch mournfu' throu' the Broom, The very Lift puts on a heavy Gloom: My Neibour Colin too, he bears a Part, His Face speaks out the Sairness of his Heart; Tell, tell me Colin, for my bodding Thought, A Bang of Fears into my Breast has brought, COLIN. Where hast thou been thou Simpleton, wha speers The Cause of a' our Sorrow and ours Tears? Wha unconcern'd can hear the common Skaith The Warld receives by lovely Keitha's Death? The bonniest Sample of what's good and kind; Fair was her Make, and heav'nly was her Mind. But now this sweetest Flower of a' our Plain, Leaves us to sigh, tho a' our Sighs are vain; For never mair she'll grace the heartsome Green, Ay heartsome when she deign'd there to be seen. Speak Flowry Meadows where she us'd to wauk, Speak Flocks and Burds wha've heard her sing or tauk. Did ever you sae meikle Beauty bear, Or ye sae mony heav'nly Accents hear: Ye painted Haughs, ye Minstrels of the Air Lament, for lovely Keitha is nae mair. RINGAN. Ye westlin Winds that gently us'd to play On her white Breast, and steal some Sweets away, Whilst her delicious Breath perfum'd your Breeze, Which gratefu' Flora took to feed her Bees. Bear on your Wings, round Earth, her Spoteless Fame, Worthy that noble Race She was Daughter to the late Earl Marishal, the third of that honourable Rank of Nobility. from whence she came; Resounding Braes where e'er she us'd to lean, And view the Crystal Burn glide o'er the Green, Return your Echoe's to our mournfu' Sang, And let the Streams in Murmures bear't alang. Ye unkend Powers, wha Water haunt or Air, Lament, for lovely Keitha is nae mair. COLIN. Ah! wha cou'd tell the Beauties of her Face, Her Mouth that never op'd but wi' a Grace; Her Een which did with heav'nly Sparkles low, Her modest Cheek flush'd with a rosie Glow, Her fair brent Brow, smooth as the unrunkled Deep, When a' the Winds are in their Caves asleep: Her Presence like a Simmer's Morning Ray, Lighten'd our Hearts, and gart ilk Place look gay. Now twin'd of Life, these Charms look cauld and blae, And what before gave Joy, now makes us wae. Her Goodness shin'd in ilka pious Deed,— A Subject, Ringan, for a lofty Reed! A Shepherd's Sang maun sic high Thoughts decline, Lest rustick Notes should darken what's divine. Youth, Beauty, Graces, a' that's good and fair Lament, for lovely Keitha is nae mair. RINGAN. How tenderly she smooth'd our Master's Mind, When round his manly Waist her Arms she twin'd, And look'd a Thousand saft Things to his Heart, While native Sweetness sought nae Help frae Art. To him her Merit still appear'd mair bright, As yielding she own'd his superior Right. Baith saft and sound he slept within her Arms, Gay were his Dreams, the Influence of her Charms. Soon as the Morning dawn'd he'd draw the Screen, And watch the op'ning of her fairer Een; Whence sweetest Rays gusht out in sic a Thrang, Beyond Expression in my rural Sang. COLIN. O Clementina! sprouting fair Remains Of her, wha was the Glory of our Plains. Dear Innocence with Infant Darkness blest, Which hides the Happiness that thou hast mist. May a' thy Mither's Sweets thy Portion be, And a' thy Mither's Graces shine in thee. RINGAN. She loot us ne'er gae hungry to the Hill, And a' she gae, she geed it wi' good Will; Fow mony, mony a ane will mind that Day On which frae us she's tane sae soon away, Baith Hynds and Herds, wha's Cheeks bespake nae Scant, And throu' the Howms could whistle, sing and rant, Will miss her sair, till happily they find Anither in her Place sae good and kind.

Things gang sae uneven, I canna well take up the Will of Heav'n. Our Crosses teughly last us mony a Year, But unco soon our Blessings disappear. RINGAN. I'll tell thee Colin my last Sunday's Note, I tented well Mess Thamas ilka Jot.

Come, Colin, dight your Cheeks and banish Care, Our Lady's happy, tho with us nae mair. To the Right Honourable, The Town-Council of EDINBURGH, THE ADDRESS of Allan Ramsay. Your Poet humbly means and shaws, That contrair to just Rights and Laws I've suffer'd muckle Wrang By Lucky Reid A Printers Relict, who with the Hawkers Reprinted my Pastoral on Mr. Addison, without my Knowledge on ugly Paper, full of Errors., and Ballad Singers, Wha thum'd with their coarse dirty Fingers Sweet Edie's Funeral-Sang. They spoil'd my Sense and staw my Cash, My Muses Pride murgully'd, And printing it like their vile Trash, The honest Lieges whilly'd. Thus undone, to London One of their uncorrect Copies was re-printed at London by Bernard Lintot in Folio first, before he printed it a second Time from a correct Copy of my own, with the honourable Mr. Burchet's English Version of it.

Yet Gleg-eyed Friends throw the Disguise Receiv'd it as a dainty Prize For a' it was sae hav'ren, Gart Lintot take it to his Press, And clead it in a braw new Dress, Syne took it to the Tavern. But tho it was made clean and braw, Sae sair it had been knoited, It blather'd Buff Spoke Nonsense, from Words being wanting, and many wrong spell'd and changed, such as, gras for gars, Praise for Phrase, &amp;c. before them a', And aftentimes turn'd doited. It griev'd me and reav'd me Of kindly Sleep and Rest, By Carlings and Gorlings To be sae sair opprest. Wherefore to You ne'er kend to guide ill, But wisely had the good Town's Bridle, My Case I plainly tell, And, as your ain A free Citizen., plead I may have Your Word of Weight To interpose their just Authority in my Favour, and grant me an Act to ward off these little Pirates, which I gratefully acknowledge the Receipt of., when now I crave To guide my Gear my sell.

AN EPISTLE TO Mr. JAMES ARBUCKLE of Belfast, A. M. Edinburgh, January 1719. As Errant Knight with Sword and Pistol, Bestrides his Steed with mighty Fistle; Then stands some Time in jumbled Swither To ride in this Road or that ither; At last spurs on, and disna care for A how, a what Way, or a wherefore. Or like extemporary Quaker, Wafting his Lungs, t'enlighten weaker Lanthorns of Clay, where Light is wanting, With formless Phrase, and formal Canting; While Jacob Behmen's A Quaker, who wrote Volumes of unintelligible enthusiastick Bombast. Salt does season, And saves his Thought frae corrupt Reason, Gowling aloud with Motions queerest, Yerking these Words out which ly nearest. Thus I (no longer to illustrate With Similies, lest I should frustrate Design Laconick of a Letter, With Heap of Language and no Matter,) Bang'd up my blyth auld-fashion'd Whistle, To sowf ye o'er a short Epistle, Without Rule, Compasses, or Charcoal, Or serious Study in a dark Hole. Three Times I ga'e the Muse a Rug, Then bate my Nails and claw'd my Lug; Still heavy, at the last my Nose I prim'd with an inspiring Dose, Vide Mr. Arbuckle's Poem on Snuff. Then did the Ideas dance, (dear safe us!) As they'd been daft.—Here ends the Preface. Good Mr. James Arbuckle, Sir, (That's Merchant's Stile, as clean as Fir) Ye're welcome back Having been in his Native Ireland visiting his Friends. to Caledonie, Lang Life and thriving light upon ye, Harvest, Winter, Spring and Summer, And ay keep up your heartsome Humor, That ye may thro' your lucky Task go, Of brushing up our Sister Glasgow; Where Lads are dextrous at improving, And docile Lasses fair and loving: But never tent these Fellows Girning, Wha wear their Faces ay in Mourning, And frae pure Dullness are malicious, Terming ilk Turn that's witty, vicious. Now, Jamie, in neist Place, Secundo, To give you what's your Due in mundo; That is to say in hame o'er Phrases, To tell ye, Men of Mettle praises Ilk Verse of yours when they can light on't, And trouth I think they're in the right on't; For there's ay something sae auldfarran, Sae slid, sae unconstrain'd and darrin, In ilka Sample we have seen yet, That little better e'er has been yet. Sae much for that.—My Friend Arbuckle, I ne'er afore roos'd ane sae muckle. Fause Flat'ry nane but Fools will tickle, That gars me hate it like auld Nicol: But when ane's of his Merit conscious, He's in the wrang, when prais'd, that glunshes. Thirdly, Not tether'd to Connection, But rattling by inspir'd Direction, When ever Fame, with Voice like Thunder, Sets up a Chield a Warld's Wonder, Either for slashing Fowk to dead, Or having Wind-mills in his Head, Or Poet, or an airy Beau, Or ony twa Leg'd Rary-show, They wha have never seen't are bissy To speer what like a Carlie is he. Imprimis then, for Tallness I Am five Foot and four Inches high: A Black-a-vic'd snod dapper Fallow, Nor lean, nor overlaid wi' Tallow. With Phiz of a Morocco Cut, Resembling a late Man of Wit, Auld-gabbet Spec The Spectator, who gives us a fictitious Description of his short Face and Taciturnity, that he had been esteem'd a dumb Man for ten Years., wha was sae Cunning To be a Dummie ten Years running. Then for the Fabrick of my Mind, 'Tis mair to Mirth than Grief inclin'd. I rather choose to laugh at Folly, Than show Dislike by Melancholy; Well judging a sowr heavy Face Is not the truest Mark of Grace. I hate a Drunkard or a Glutton, Yet am nae Fae to Wine and Mutton. Great Tables ne'er engag'd my Wishes, When crowded with o'er mony Dishes, A healthfu' Stomach sharply set Prefers a Back-sey pipin het. I never cou'd imagin't vicious Of a fair Fame to be ambitious: Proud to be thought a comick Poet, And let a Judge of Numbers know it, I court Occasion thus to show it. Second of thirdly,—pray take heed, Ye's get a short Swatch of my Creed. To follow Method negatively Ye ken takes Place of positively. Well then, I'm nowther Whig nor Tory, Nor Credit give to Purgatory. Transub, Loretta-house, and mae Tricks, As Prayers to Saints, Katties, and Patricks; Nor Asgilite Mr. Asgil a late Member of Parliament advanced (whether in Jest or Earnest I know not) some very whimsical Opinions, particularly, That People need not die if they pleas'd, but be translated alive to Heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Clerksonian [sic], Bessy Clarkson a Lanerk-Shire Woman. Vide the History of her Life and Principles., nor Bess Clarksonian, Nor Mountaineer Our wild Folks, who always prefer a Hill-side to a Church under any civil Authority.

Neist Anti-Tolland, Blunt and Wh?, Know positively I'm a Christian, Believing Truths and thinking free, Wishing thrawn Parties wad agree. Say, wad ye ken my gate of Fending, My Income, Management, and Spending? Born to nae Lairdship, mair's the Pity! Yet Denison of this fair City. I make what honest Shift I can, And in my ain House am Good-man, Which stands on Edinburgh's Street the Sun-side, I theek the out, and line the Inside Of mony a douse and witty Pash, And baith Ways gather in the Cash; Thus heartily I graze and beau it, And keep a Wife ay great wi' Poet. Contented I have sic a Skair, As does my Business to a Hair, And fain wa'd prove to ilka Scot That Poortith's no the Poet's Lot. Fourthly and lastly baith togither, Pray let us ken when ye come hither; There's mony a canty Carle and me Wa'd be much comforted to see ye. But if your outward be Refractory, Send us your inward Manufactory. That when we're kedgy o'er our Claret, We correspond may with your Spirit. Accept of my kind Wishes, with The same to Dons Buttler and Smith; Health Wit and Joy, Sauls large and free, Be a' your Fates,—sae God be wi' ye. To the Right Honourable, WILLIAM Earl of Dalhousie. Mæcenas atavis edite Regibus, Horace. Dalhousie of an auld Descent, My Chief, my Stoup and Ornament, For Entertainment a wee while, Accept this Sonnet with a Smile; Setting great Horace in my View, He to Mecenas, I to you: But that my Muse may sing with Ease, I'll keep or drap him as I please. How differently are Fowk inclin'd, There's hardly twa of the same Mind: Some like to study, some to play, Some on the Links to win the Day, And gar the Courser rin like wood, A' drapin down with Sweat and Blood: The Winner syne assumes a Look Might gain a Monarch or a Duke. Neist view the Man with pauky Face Has mounted to a fashous Place, Inclin'd by an o'er-ruling Fate, He's pleas'd with his uneasy State: Glowr'd at a while, he gangs fou braw, Till frae his kittle Post he fa'. The Lothian Farmer he likes best To be of good faugh Riggs possest, And fen upon a frugal Stock, Where his Forbeers had us'd the Yoke: Nor is he fond to leave his Wark, And venture in a rotten Bark, Syne unto far aff Countries steer On tumbling Waves to gather Gear. The Merchant wreck'd upon the Main Swears he'll never venture on't again; That he had rather live on Cakes, And shyrest Swats, with Landart Maiks, As rin the Risk by Storms to have, When he is dead, a living Grave. But Seas turn smooth, and he grows fain, And fairly takes his Word again: Tho he shou'd to the Bottom sink, Of Poverty he downa think. Some like to laugh their Time away, To dance while Pipes or Fidles play, And have nae Sense of ony Want As lang as they can drink and rant. The rat'ling Drum and Trumpet's Tout Delight young Swankies that are stout: What his kind frighted Mother ugs, Is Musick to the Soger's Lugs. The Hunter with his Hounds and Hawks Bangs up afore his Wife awakes; Nor speers gin she has ought to say, But scowrs o'er Highs and Hows a' Day, Throw Moss and Moor, nor does he care Whither the Day be foul or fair, If he his trusty Hounds can chear To hunt the Tod or drive the Deer. May I be happy in my Lays, And won a lasting Wreath of Bays, Is a' my Wish; well pleas'd to sing Beneath a Tree, or by a Spring, While Lads and Lasses on the Mead Attend my Caledonian Reed, And with the sweetest Notes rehearse My Thoughts, and roose me for my Verse. If you, my Lord, class me amang Those who have sung baith saft and strang, Of smiling Love or doughty Deed, To Starns sublime I'll lift my Head. Horace to Virgil, on his taking a Voyage to Athens. Sic te diva potens Cypri, ? O Cyprian Goddess twinkle clear, And Helens' Brithers ay appear; Ye Stars wha shed a lucky Light, Auspicious ay keep in a Sight; King Eol grant a tydie Tirl, But boast the Blast that rudely whirl; Dear Ship be canny with your Care, At Athens land my Virgil fair, Syne soon and safe, baith Lith and Spaul, Bring hame the tae haff o' my Saul. Daring and unco stout he was, With Heart hool'd in three Sloughs of Brass, Wha ventur'd first on the rough Sea, With hempen Branks and Horse of Tree: Wha on the weak Machine durst ride Throu' Tempests, and a rairing Tide; Nor clinty Craigs, nor Hurrycane, That drives the Adriatick Main, And gars the Ocean gowl and quake, Cou'd e'er a Soul sae sturdy shake. The Man wha cou'd sic Rubs win o'er, Without a Wink at Death might glowr, Wha unconcern'd can take his Sleep Amang the Monsters of the Deep. Jove vainly twin'd the Sea and Eard, Since Mariners are not afraid. With Laws of Nature to dispence, And impiously treat Providence. Audacious Men at nought will stand When vicious Passions have command. Prometheus ventur'd up and staw A lowan Coal frae Heav'ns high Ha'; Unsonsy Thift, which Feavers brought In Bikes, which Fowk like Sybous hought: Then Death erst slaw began to ling, And fast as Haps to dart his Sting. Neist Dedalus must contradict Nature forsooth, and Feathers stick Upon his Back, syne upward streek, And in at Jove's high Winnocks keek, While Hercules, wi's Timber Mell, Plays rap upo' the Yates of Hell. What is't Man winna ettle at? E'en wi' the Gods he'll bell the Cat: Tho Jove be very Laith to kill, They winna let his Bowt ly still. An ODE to Mr. F?. Solvitur acris hiems ? Horace Now Gowans sprout and Lavrocks sing, And welcome West Winds warm the Spring, O'er Hill and Dale they saftly blaw, And drive the Winter's Cauld awa. The Ships lang gyzen'd at the Peer Now spread their Sails and smoothly steer, The Nags and Nowt hate wissen'd Strae, And frisking to the Fields they gae, Nor Hynds wi' Elson and hemp Lingle, Sit solling Shoon out o'er the Ingle. Now bonny Haughs their Verdure boast, That late were clade wi' Snaw and Frost, With her gay Train the Paphian Queen By Moon-light dances on the Green, She leads while Nymphs and Graces sing, And trip around the Fairy Ring. Mean Time poor Vulcan hard at Thrift, Gets mony a sair and heavy Lift, Whilst rinnen down, his haff-blind Lads Blaw up the Fire, and thump the Gads. Now leave your Fitsted on the Dew, And busk ye'r sell in Habit new. Be gratefu' to the guiding Powers, And blythly spend your easy Hours. O kanny F?! tutor Time, And live as lang's ye'r in your Prime; That ill bred Death has nae Regard To King or Cottar, or a Laird, As soon a Castle he'll attack, As Waus of Divots roof'd wi' Thack. Immediately we'll a' take Flight Unto the mirk Realms of Night, As Stories gang, with Gaists to roam, In gloumie Pluto's gousty Dome; Bid fair Good-day to Pleasure syne Of bonny Lasses and red Wine. Then deem ilk little Care a Crime, Dares waste an Hour of precious Time; And since our Life's sae unko short, Enjoy it a', ye've nae mair for't. To the Ph? an ODE. Vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte ? Horace. Look up to Pentland's towring Taps, Buried beneath great Wreaths of Snaw, O'er ilka Cleugh, ilk Scar and Slap, As high as ony Roman Wa'. Driving their Baws frae Whins or Tee, There's no ae Gowfer to be seen, Nor dousser Fowk wysing a Jee The Byas Bouls on Tamson's Green. Then fling on Coals, and ripe the Ribs, And beek the House baith Butt and Ben, That Mutchken Stoup it hads but Dribs, Then let's get in the tappit Hen. Good Claret best keeps out the Cauld, And drives away the Winter soon, It makes a Man baith gash and bauld, And heaves his Saul beyond the Moon. Leave to the Gods your ilka Care, If that they think us worth their While, They can a Rowth of Blessings spare, Which will our fashious Fears beguile. For what they have a Mind to do, That will they do, should we gang wood, If they command the Storms to blaw, Then upo' sight the Hailstains thud. But soon as e'er they cry, Bequiet, The blatt'ring Winds dare nae mair move, But cour into their Caves, and wait The high Command of supreme Jove. Let neist Day come as it thinks fit, The present Minute's only ours, On Pleasure let's imploy our Wit, And laugh at Fortune's feckless Power. Be sure ye dinna quat the Grip Of ilka Joy when ye are young, Before auld Age your Vitals nip, And lay ye twafald o'er a Rung. Sweet Youth's a blyth and heartsome Time, Then Lads and Lasses while it's May, Gae pou the Gowan in its Prime, Before it wither and decay. Watch the saft Minutes of Delyte, When Jenny speaks beneath her Breath, And kisses, laying a the wyte On you if she kepp ony Skaith. Haith ye're ill bred, she'll smiling say, Ye'll worry me ye greedy Rook; Syne frae your Arms she'll rin away, And hide her sell in some dark Nook: Her Laugh will lead you to the Place Where lies the Happiness ye want, And plainly tells you to your Face, Nineteen Nay-says are haff a Grant. Now to her heaving Bosom cling, And sweetly toolie for a Kiss, Frae her fair Finger whop a Ring, As Taiken of a future Bliss. These Bennisons, I'm very sure, Are of the Gods indulgent Grant; Then surly Carles, whisht, forbear To plague us with your whining Cant. To Mr. William Aikman. 'Tis granted, Sir, Pains may be spar'd Your Merit to set forth, When there's sae few wha claim Regard, That disna ken your Worth. Yet Poets give immortal Fame To Mortals that excel, Which if neglected they're to blame; But you've done that your sell. While frae Originals of yours Fair Copies shall be tane, And fix'd on Brass to busk our Bow'rs, Your Mem'ry shall remain. To your ain Deeds the maist deny'd, Or of a Taste o'er fine, Maybe ye're, but o'er right, afraid To sink in Verse like mine. The last can ne'er the Reason prove, Else wherefore with good Will Do ye my nat'ral Lays approve, And help me up the Hill? By your Assistance unconstrain'd To Courts I can repair, And by your Art my Way I've gain'd To Closets of the Fair. Had I a Muse like lofty Pope, For touring Numbers fit, Then I the ingenious Mind might hope In truest Light to hit. But comick Tale and Sonnet slee Are coosten for my Share, And if in these I bear the Gree, I'll think it very fair. Spoken to three young Ladies, who would have me to determine which of them was the bonniest. Me anes three Beauties did surround, And ilka Beauty gave a Wound, Whilst they with smiling Eye, Said, Allan, which think ye maist fair? Gi'e Judgment frankly, never spare. Hard is the Task said I: But added, seeing them sae free, Ladies ye maun say mair to me, And my Demand right fair is; First, like the gay Celestial Three, Shaw a' your Charms, and then ha'e wi' ye, Faith I shall be your Paris. TO Sir William Bennet Of Grubbet, Bar?. While now in Discord giddy Changes reel, And some are rack'd about on Fortunes Wheel, You with undaunted Stalk, and Brow serene, May trace your Groves, and press the dewy Green; No guilty Twangs your manly Joys to wound, Or horrid Dreams to make your Sleep unsound. To such as you, who can mean Care despise, Nature's all beautiful 'twixt Earth and Skies. Not hurried with the Thirst of unjust Gain, You can delight your self on Hill or Plain, Observing when those tender Sprouts appear, Which crowd with fragrant Sweets the youthful Year. Your lovely Scenes of Marlefield abound With as much Choise as is in Britain found: Here fairest Plants from Nature's Bosom start From Soil prolifick, serv'd with curious Art: Here oft the heedful Gazer is beguil'd, And wanders through an artificial Wild, While native flowry Green, and christal Strands, Appear the Labours of ingenious Hands. Most happy he who can those Sweets enjoy With Taste refin'd, which does not easy cloy. Not so Plebeian Souls, whom sporting Fate Thrusts into Life upon a large Estate, While Spleen their weak Imagination sowrs, They're at a Loss how to imploy their Hours: The sweetest Plants which fairest Gardens show, Are lost to them, for them unheeded grow. Such purblind Eyes ne'er view the son'rous Page, Where shines the Raptures of poetick Rage, Nor through the Microscope can take Delight, T'observe the Tusks and Bristles of a Mite; Nor by the lengthen'd Tub[e] learn to descry These shining Worlds which roll around the Sky. Bid such read Hist'ry to improve their Skill, Polite Excuse! Their Memories are ill. Moll's Maps may in their Dining-rooms make show, But their Contents they're not oblig'd to know; And gen'rous Friendship's out of Sight too fine, They think it only means a Glass of Wine. But he whose chearful Mind hath higher Flown, And adds learn'd Thoughts of others to his own, Has seen the World, and read the Volume Man, And can the Springs and Ends of Actions scan, Has fronted Deaths in Service of his King, And drunken deep of the Castalian Spring; This Man can live,—and happiest Life's his due, Can be a Friend,—a Virtue known to few; Yet all such Virtues strongly shine in You. An EPISTLE to a Friend at Florence, in his Way to Rome. Your steady Impulse foreign Climes to view, To study Nature, and what Art can shew, I now approve, while my warm Fancy walks O'er Italy, and with your Genius talks, We trace with glowing Breast and peiercing Look The curious Galery of th'illustrious Duke, Where all those Masters of the Arts divine, With Pencils, Pens, and Chizels greatly Shine, Immortalizing the Augustan Age, On Medals, Canvas, Stone, or writen Page. Profiles and Busts Originals express, And antique Scrols, old e'er we knew the Press. For's Love to Science, and each virtuous Scot, May Days unnumber'd be great Cosmus' Lot. The sweet Hesperian Fields you'll next explore, 'Twixt Arnus' Banks and Tiber's fertile Shore. Now, now I wish my Organs could keep Pace, With my fond Muse and you these Plains to trace, We'd enter Rome with an uncommon Taste, And feed our Minds on every famous Waste; Amphitheaters, Columns, Royal Tombs, Triumphal Arches, Ruines of vast Domes, Old aerial Aqueducts, and strong pav'd Roads, Which seem to've been not wrought by Men but Gods. These view'd, we'd then survey with outmost Care What modern Rome produces fine or rare, Where Buildings rise with all the Strength of Art, Proclaiming their great Architect's Desert, Which Citron Shades surround and Jessamin, And all the Soul of Raphael shines within: Then we'd regale our Ears with sounding Notes, Which warble tuneful thro' the beardless Throats, Join'd with the vib'rating harmonious Strings, And breathing Tubes, while the soft Eunoch sings. Of all those Dainties take a hearty Meal; But let your Resolution still prevail, Return before your Pleasure grow a Toil, To longing Friends, and your own native Soil: Preserve your Health, your Virtue still improve, Hence you'll invite Protection from above. The beautiful Rose Tree enclosed. With Awe and Pleasure we behold thy Sweets, Thy lovely Roses have their pointed Guards, Yet tho the Gath'rer Opposition meets, The fragrant Purchase all his Pain rewards. But hedg'd about and watch'd with warry Eyes, O Plant superior, beautiful and fair, We view thee like yon Stars which gem the Skies, But equally to gain we must despair. Ah! wert thou growing on some secret Plain, And found by me, how ravisht would I meet All thy transporting Charms to ease my Pain, And feast my raptur'd Soul on all that's sweet. Thus sung poor Symon: Symon was in love, His too aspiring Passion made him smart; The Rose Tree was a Mistress far above The Shepherd's Hope, which broke his tender Heart. To R? H? B?, an ODE. Nullam Vare sacra vite prius severis arborem, Circa mite solum Tiburis &amp; mænia Catili. Hor. O B?, cou'd these Fields of thine Bear as in Gaul the juicy Vine, How sweet the bonny Grape wou'd shine On Wau's where now, Your Apricocks and Peaches fine Their Branches bow. Since humane Life is but a Blink, Why should we its short Joys sink; He disna live that canna link The Glass about, When warm'd with Wine, like Men we think, And grow mair stout. The cauldrife Carlies clog'd wi' Care, Wha gathering Gear gang hyt and gare, If ramn'd we red, they rant and rair Like mirthfu' Men, It soothly shaws them they can spare, A rowth to spend. What Soger when with Wine he's bung Did e'er complain he had been dung, Or of his Toil, or empty Spung, Na, o'er his Glass, Nought but braw Deeds imploy his Tongue, Or some sweet Lass. Yet Trouth, 'tis proper we should stint Our sells to a fresh mod'rate Pint, Why should we (the blyth Blessing) mint To waist or spill, Since, aften, when our Reason's tint We may do ill. Let's set these Hair-brain'd Fowk in View, That when they're stupid, mad and fow Do brutal Deeds, which aft they rue For a' their Days, Which frequently prove very few To such as these. Then let us grip our Bliss mair sicker, And tape our Heal, and sprightly Liquor, Which sober tane makes Wit the quicker, And Sense mair keen, While graver Heads that's muckle thicker Grane wi' the Spleen. May ne'er sic wicked Fumes arise In me shall break a' sacred Ties, And gar me like a Fool despise With Stifness rude, What ever my best Friends advise Tho ne'er so good. 'Tis best then to evite the Sin Of bending till our Sauls gae blin, Lest like our Glass our Breasts grow thin, And let Fowk peep, At ilka secret hid within That we should keep. Clyde's Welcome TO HIS PRINCE. What chearful Sounds from ev'ry Side I hear, How beauteous on their Banks my Nymphs appear, Got throw these massy Mountains at my Source, O'er Rocks stupendous The River falls over several high Precipices, such as Corrah's Lin, Stane-Byre Lin, &amp;c. of my upper Course. To these fair Plains where I more smoothly move, Throw verdant Vales to meet Evana's The small River Evan which joins Clyde near Hamilton. Love. Yonder she comes beneath Dodona's Shade, How blyth she looks! how sweet and gaylie clade; Her flowry Bounds bears all the Pride of May, While round her soft Meanders Shepherd's play. Hail lovely Naid to my Bosom large, Amidst my Stores commit thy chrystal Charge, And speak these Joys all thy Deportment shews, That to old Ocean I may have good News. With solemn Voice, thus spoke Majestick Clyde, In softer Notes lov'd Evan thus reply'd. Great Glotta, long have I had Cause to mourn, While my forsaken Stream gusht from my Urn. Since my late Lord his Nation's just Delight, Greatly lamented sunk in endless Night. His hopeful Stem our chief Desire and Boast, Expos'd to Danger on some foreign Coast, Lonely for Years, I've murmur'd on my Way, When dark I wept, and sight in shining Day. The Sire return'd, just Reasons for thy Pains, So long to wind through solitary Plains: Thy Loss was mine, I sympathiz'd with thee, Since one our Griefs, then share thy Joys with me. Then hear me, liquid Chiftain of the Dale, Hush all your Cat'racts, till I tell my Tale, Then rise and rore, and kiss your bord'ring Flowers, And sound our Joys around yon lordly Towers; Yon lordly Towers, which happy now contain, Our brave and youthful Prince return'd again. Welcome, in loudest Raptures cry'd the Flood, His Welcome echo'd from each Hill and Wood; Enough Evana, long may they contain The noble Youth safely return'd again. From the green Mountain From the same Hill the Rivers Clyde, Tweed and Annan have their Rise, yet run to three different Seas, viz. the Northern Ocean, the German Ocean, and the Irish Sea. where I lift my Head, With my twin Brothers Annan and the Tweed, To those high Arches The Bridge of Glasgow, where as its reported, St. Mungo the Patron of that City, drew up a Fish that brought him a Ring, which had been dropt; which Miracle Glasgow retains the Memory of in their Arms. where, as Culdees sing, The pious Mungo fish'd the Trout and Ring. My fairest Nymphs shall on my Margin play, And make ev'n all the Year one holy Day. The Sylvan Powers and Watches of each Hight, Where Fleecy Flocks and climbing Goats delight, Shall from their Groves and rocky Mountains roam, To join with us, and sing his Welcome home. With lofty Notes we'll sound his high Descent, His dawning Merits and heroick Bent. These early Rays which stedfastly shall shine, And add new Glories to his ancient Line. A Line ay loyal, and fir'd with generous Zeal The bravest Patrons of the Common-weal. From him who plung'd his Sword (so Muses sing) Vide the ingenious Mr. Patrick Gordon's Account of this Illustrious Family in his Poem on the valiant Atchievements of our great King Robert. sirnamed the Bruce, Page 45. beginning at this Stanza, the Prophet speaks to our Monarch. Now is thy Time, quoth he, there shall arrive A worthy Knight, that from his native Land Shall fly, because he bravely shall deprive, In glorious Fight, a Knight that shall withstand Thy Praises due, while he doth thee descrive, Yea even, this Knight shall with victorious Hand Come here, whose Name his Seed shall eternize, And still thy virt'ous Line shall sympathize. Deep in his Breast, who durst defame our King. We'll sing the Fire, which in his Bosom glows To warm his Friends, and scorch his daring Foes; Endow'd with all these sweet, yet manly Charms, As fits him for the Fields of Love, or Arms. Fixt in an high and independant State, Above to act, what's little to be great. Guard him, first Power, whose Hand directs the Sun, And teaches me throw Caverns dark to run, Long may he on his own fair Plains reside, And Slight my Rival Thames, and love his Clyde. On the most Honourable The Marquess of BOWMONT's Cutting off his Hair. Shall Berenice's Tresses mount the Skies, And by the Muse to shining Fame arise, Bellinda's Lock invite the smoothest Lays Of him whose Merit Claims the British Bays, And not, dear Bowmont, beautiful and young, The graceful Ringlets of thy Head be sung! How many tender Hearts thine Eyes hath pain'd! How many sighing Nymphs thy Locks have chain'd! The God of Love beheld him with Envy, And on Cyth'rea's Lap began to cry, All drench'd in Tears, O Mother help your Son! Else by a mortal Rival I'm undone; With happy Charms he incroaches on my Sway, His Beauty disconcerts the Plots I lay. When I've made Cloe her humble Slave admire, Straight he appears and kindles new Desire; She sighs for him, and all my Art beguiles, Whilst he, like me, commands and careless smiles. Ah me! These sable Circles of his Hair, Which wave around his Beauties red and fair, I cannot bear! Adonis would seem dim, With all his flaxen Locks, if plac'd by him. Venus reply'd, No more, my dearest Boy, Shall those inchanting Curls thy Peace destroy; For ever sep'rate they shall cease to grow, Or round his Cheek, or on his Shoulders flow; I'll use my Slight, and make them quickly feel Their Honour's lost by the invading Steel: I'll turn my self in Shape of Mode and Health, And gain upon his youthful Mind by Stealth: Three Times the Sun shall not have rouz'd the Morn, E'er he consent these from him shall be shorn. The Promise she perform'd, but Labour vain, And still shall prove, while his bright Eyes remain; And of Revenge blind Cupid must despair, As long's the lovely Sex are grac'd with Hair; They'll yield the conquering Glories of their Heads, To form around his Beauty easy Shades; And in Return, Thalia spaes and sings, His lop'd off Locks shall sparkle in their Rings. TO SOME YOUNG LADIES Who had been displeas'd at a Gentleman's too imprudently asserting, That to be condemn'd to perpetual Virginity was the greatest Punishment could be inflicted on any of their Sex. Whether condemn'd to a Virgin State By the superiour Powers, Would to your Sex prove cruel Fate, I'm sure it would to ours. From you the numerous Nations spring, Your Breasts our Beings save, Your Beauties make the youthful sing, And sooth the old and grave. Alas! How soon would every Wight Despise both Wit and Arms, To primitive old Chaos Night We'd sink without your Charms. No more our Breath would be our Care, Were Love from us exil'd, Sent back to Heaven with all the Fair, This World would turn a Wild. Regardless of these sacred Tyes, Wife, Husband, Father, Son, All Government we would despise, And like wild Tygers run. Then, Ladies, pardon the Mistake, And with th'accus'd agree, I beg it for each Lover's sake, Low bended on my Knee. And frankly wish what has been said By the audacious Youth, Might be your Thought, but I'm afraid It will not prove a Truth. For often, ah! you make us groan By your too cold Disdain, Then quarrel with us when we moan And rave amidst our Pain. To Mr. Joseph Mitchel on the successful Representation of a Tragedy wrote by him. But Jealousie, dear Jos, which aft gives Pain To scrimpit Sauls, I own my sell right vain To see a native trusty Friend of mine, Sae brawly 'mang our bleezing Billies shine. Yes, wherefore no, shaw them the frozen North Can towring Minds with heav'nly Heat bring forth; Minds that can mount with an uncommon Wing, And frae black heath'ry headed Mountains sing, As saft as he that Haughs Hesperian trades, Or leans beneath the Aromatick Shades. Bred to the Love of Lit'rature and Arms, Still something great a Scottish Bosom warms: Tho nurs'd on Ice, and educate in Snaw, Honour and Liberty eags him to draw A Hero's Sword, or an heroick Quill, The monst'rous Faes of Right and Wit to kill. Well may ye further in your leal Design, To thwart the Gowks, and gar the Brethren tine The wrang Opinion which they lang have had, That a' which mounts the Stage—is surely bad. Stupidly dull! But Fools ay Fools will be, And nane's sae blind as them that winna see. Where's Vice and Virtue set in juster Light? Where can a glancing Genius shine mair bright? Where can we humane Life review mair plain, Than in the happy Plot and curious Scene? If in themsells sic fair Designs were ill, We ne'er had priev'd the sweet drammatick Skill Of Congrave, Adison, Steel, Rowe, and Hill; Hill, wha the highest Road to Fame doth chuse, And has some upper Seraph for his Muse: It maun be sae, else how could he display With so just Strength the great tremendous Day. Sic Patterns, Joseph, always keep in View, Ne'er fash if ye can please the thinking Few, Then spite of Malice Worth shall have its due. Colin and Grisy parting. A SONG to the Tune of Woes my Heart that we shou'd sunder. With broken Words and downcast Eyes, Poor Colin spoke his Passion tender, And parting with his Grisy, cries, Ah! Woes my Heart that we should sunder. To others I am cold as Snow, But kindle with thine Eyes like Tinder; From thee with Pain I'm forc'd to go, It breaks my Heart that we should sunder. Chain'd to thy Charms I cannot range, No Beauty new my Love shall hinder, Nor Time nor Place shall ever change My Vows, tho we're oblig'd to sunder. The Image of thy graceful Air, And Beauties which invite our Wonder, Thy lively Wit and Prudence rare Shall still be present tho we sunder. Dear Nymph believe thy Swain in this, You'l ne'er engage a Heart that's kinder, Then seal a Promise with a Kiss, Always to love me tho we sunder. Ye Gods take Care of my dear Lass, That as I leave her I may find her, When that blest Time shall come to pass We'll meet again and never sunder. Spoken to two young Ladies who asked if I could say any thing on them: One excell'd in a beautiful Complection, the other in fine Eyes. To the first. Upon your Cheek sits blooming Youth. To the other. Heaven sparkles in your Eye. To both. There's something sweet about each Mouth, Dear Ladies let me try. The Mill, Mill,—O. A SONG. Beneath a green Shade I fand a fair Maid Was sleeping sound and still—O, A' lowan wi' Love my Fancy did rove, Around her with good Will—O; Her Bosom I press'd, but sunk in her Rest She stirdna my Joy to spill—O: While kindly she slept close to her I crept, And kiss'd, and kiss'd her my fill—O. Oblig'd by Command in Flanders to land, T'employ my Courage and Skill—O; Frae 'er quietly I staw, hois'd Sails and awa, For Wind blew fair on the Bill—O. Twa Years brought me hame, when loud fraising Fame Tald me with a Voice right shill—O, My Lass like a Fool had mounted the Stool, viz. Of Repentance. Nor kend wha'd done 'er the Ill—O. Mair fond of her Charms, with my Son in her Arms, I ferlying speer'd how she fell—O, Wi' a Tear in her Eye, quoth she, let me die, Sweet Sir, gin I can tell—O. Love gae the Command, I took her by th'Hand, And bade her a' Fears expell—O, And nae mair look wan, for I was the Man Wha had done her the Deed my sell—O. My bonny sweet Lass on the gowany Grass, Beneath the Shilling-hill Where they winnow the Chaff from the Corns.—O. If I did Offence I'se make ye Amends Before I leave Peggy's-Mill—O. O the Mill, Mill—O, and the Kill, Kill—O, And the Cogging of the Wheel—O; The Sack and the Sive, a' thae ye maun leave, And round with a Soger reel—O. The Poet's Wish: An ODE. Among the Lauriston Castle MSS., National Library of Scotland, is a holograph of this poem. The phrasing differs in many places from that here given. See Prefatory Note to this volume. —(Edd.) Quid dedicatum poscit Apollinem Vates? ? Hor. Frae great Apollo, Poet say, What is thy Wish, what wadst thou hae, When thou bows at his Shrine? Not Karss o' Gowrie's A large and fertile Plain on the Tay, in the Shire of Perth. fertile Field, Nor a' the Flocks the Grampians yield, That are baith sleek and fine: Not costly Things brought frae afar, As Ivory, Pearl and Gems; Nor those fair Straths that water'd are With Tay and Tweed's smooth Streams, Which gentily and daintily Eat down the flowry Braes, As greatly and quietly They wimple to the Seas. Whaever by his kanny Fate Is Master of a good Estate, That can ilk Thing afford, Let him enjoy't withoutten Care, And with the Wale of curious Fare Cover his ample Board. Much dawted by the Gods is he, Wha to the Indian Plain, Successfu' ploughs the wally Sea, And safe returns again, With Riches that hitches Him high aboon the rest Of sma' Fowk, and a' Fowk That are wi' Poortith prest. For me I can be well content To eat my Bannock on the Bent, And kitchen't wi' fresh Air; Of Lang-kail I can make a Feast, And cantily had up my Crest, And laugh at Dishes rare. Nought frae Apollo I demand, But throw a lengthen'd Life My outer Fabrick firm may stand, And Saul clear without Strife. May he then but gie then Those Blessings for my Skair, I'll fairly and squairly Quite a' and seek nae mair. The Response of the Oracle. To keep thy Saul frae puny Strife, And heeze thee out of vulgar Life, We in a morning Dream Whisper'd our Will concerning thee, To Marlus stretch'd beneath a Tree, Hard by a pop'ling Stream, He full of me shall point the Way, Where thou a Star shalt see, The Influence of whose bright Ray, Shall wing thy Muse to flee. Mair speer na, and fear na, But set thy Mind to rest, Aspire ay still high'r ay, And always hope the best. THE CONCLUSION. After the Manner of Horace, ad librum suum. Dear vent'rous Book, e'en take thy Will, And scowp around the Warld thy fill: Wow! ye're newfangle to be seen, In guilded Turky clade, and clean. Daft giddy Thing! to dare thy Fate, And spang o'er Dikes that scar the blate: But mind when anes ye're to the Bent, (Altho in vain) ye may repent. Alake, I'm flied thou aften meet, A Gang that will thee sourly treat, And ca' thee dull for a' thy Pains, When Damps distress their drouzie Brains. I dinna doubt whilst thou art new, Thoul't Favour find frae not a few, But when thou'rt rufl'd and forfairn, Sair thumb'd by ilka Coof or Bairn; Then, then by Age ye may grow wise, And ken things common gies nae Price. I'd fret, wae's me! to see the lye Beneath the Bottom of a Pye, Or cow'd out Page by Page to wrap Up Snuff, or Sweeties in a Shap. Away sic Fears, gae spread my Fame, And fix me an immortal Name; Ages to come shall thee revive, And gar thee with new Honours live. The future Criticks I forsee Shall have their Notes on Notes on thee: The Wits unborn shall Beauties find That never enter'd in my Mind. Now when thou tells how I was bred, But hough enough Very indifferently. to a mean Trade; To ballance that, pray let them ken My Saul to higher Pitch cou'd sten: And when ye shaw I'm scarce of Gear, Gar a' my Virtues shine mair clear. Tell, I the best and fairest please, A little Man that loo's my Ease, And never thole these Passions lang That rudely mint to do me wrang.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II.—(Poems: 1728) Men still are Men, and they who boldly dare, Shall triumph o'er the Sons of cold Despair.— We bring some new Materials; and what's old, New cast with Care, and in no borrowed Mold, Late Times the Verse may read, if these refuse, And from sowr Criticks vindicate the Muse. Dr. Young. Dedication To the PATRONS who subscribed for the First and this Volume. TO THE CRITICK Stand, Critick, and before ye read, Say, are ye free of Party-fead, Or of a Saul sae scrimp and rude, To envy every thing that's Good? And if I shou'd (perhaps by Chance) Something that's new and smart advance, Resolve ye not with scornful Snuff, To say 'tis a' confounded Stuff; If that's the Case, Sir, spare your Spite, For, faith, 'tis not for you I write: Gae gie your Censure higher Scope, And Congreve criticise or Pope, Young's Satires, or Swift's merry Smile, These, these are Writers worth your While. On me your Talents wad be lost, And tho' you gain a simple Boast; I want a Reader wha deals fair, And not ae real Fault will spare; Yet with good Humour will allow Me Praise, when e'er 'tis justly due: Blest be sic Readers,—but the rest That are with Spleen and Spite opprest; May Bards arise to gar them dwine, To Death with Lays the maist divine, For sma's the Skaith they'll get by mine. How many, and of various Natures, Are on this Globe the Crowd of Creatures; In Mexiconian Forests fly, Thousands that never wing'd our Sky: 'Mangst them there's ane of Feathers fair, That in the Musick bears nae Skair, Only an imitating Ranter, For whilk he bears the Name of Taunter; Soon as the Sun springs frae the East, Upon the Branch he cocks his Crest, Attentive, when frae Bough and Spray The tunefu' Throats salute the Day: The Brainless Beau attacks them a', No ane escapes him great or sma'; Frae some he takes the Tone and Manner, Frae this a Bass, frae that a Tenor, Turns Love's saft Plaint to a dull Bustle, And sprightly airs to a vile Whistle; Still labouring thus to counterfeit, He shaws the Poorness of his Wit. Anes, when with Echoe loud the Taunter Tret with Contempt ilk native Chanter, Ane of them says, We own 'tis true, Few Praises to our Sangs are due, But pray, Sir, let's have ane frae you. The Ram and Buck A Ram, the Father of a Flock, Wha'd mony Winters stood the Shock Of Northern Winds and driving Snaw, Leading his Family in a Raw, Throw Wreaths that clad the laigher Field, And drave them frae the lowner Bield, To crop contented frozen Fare, With Honesty on Hills blown bare. This Ram of upright hardy Spirit, Was really a horn'd Head of Merit. Unlike him was a neighbouring Goat, A mean Saul'd, cheating, thieving Sot; That tho' possest of Rocks the Prime, Crown'd with fresh Herbs and rowth of Thime, Yet Slave to pilfering; his Delight Was to break Gardens ilka Night, And round him steal, and aft destroy Even Things he never could enjoy: The Pleasure of a dirty Mind That is sae viciously inclin'd. Upon a Borrowing-day, when Sleet Made Twinters, and Hog-wedders bleet, And quake with Cauld: Behind a Ruck Met honest Toop and snaking Buck, Frae Chin to Tail clad with thick Hair, He bad Defiance to thin Air; But trusty Toop his Fleece had riven, When he amang the Birns was driven: Half naked the brave Leader stood, His Look compos'd, unmov'd his Mood. When thus the Goat (that had tint a' His Credit baith with great and sma', Shunn'd by them as a Pest, wad fain New Friendship with this Worthy gain.) Ram, say, shall I give you a Part Of mine, I'll do't with all my Heart, 'Tis yet a lang cauld Month to Beltan, And ye've a very raggit Kelt on; Accept, I pray, what I can spare, To clout your Doublet with my Hair. No, says the Ram, tho' my Coat's torn, Yet ken, thou Worthless, that I scorn, To be oblig'd at any Price To sic as you, whose Friendship's Vice; I'd have less Favour frae the best, Clad in a hatefu' hairy Vest Bestow'd by thee, than as I now Stand but ill drest in native Woo. Boons frae the Generous make ane smile, Frae Miscreants make Receivers vile. EPIGRAM On Receiving a Present of an Orange from Mrs. G. L. now Countess of Aboyne. Now, Priam's Son, thou may'st be mute, For I can blythly boast with thee; Thou to the Fairest gave the Fruit, The Fairest gave the Fruit to me. HEALTH: A POEM. Inscrib'd to The Right Honourable the Earl of Stair. Be't mine the Honour, once again to hear, And see the best of Men for me appear, I'll proudly chant: Be dumb, ye vulgar Throng, Stair bids me sing, to him these Lays belong; If he approves, who can condemn my Song? Of Health I sing; O Health my Portion be, And to old Age I'll sing if bless'd by thee. Blessing Divine! Heaven's fairest Gift to Man! Soul of His Joys! and Lengthner of his Span! His Span of Life preserv'd with panting Breath, Without thy Presence proves a ling'ring Death. The Victor Kings may cause wide Nations bow, And Half a Globe with conqu'ring Force subdue; Bind Princes to their Axletrees, and make The wond'ring Mob of staring Mortals quake: Erect triumphal Arches, and obtain The loud Huzza from Thousands in their Train: But if her Sweetness balmy Health denies, Without Delight Pillars or Eneids rise. Cosmellius may on Silky Twilts repose, And have a num'rous Change of finest Cloaths; Box'd in his Chair, he may be born to dine On Ortelons, and sip Tokay Wine. His Liver, if an Inflammation seize, Or wasting Lungs shall make him cough and wheeze; No more he smiles, nor can his richest Toys, Or Looking-glass, restore his wonted Joys: The rich Brocade becomes a toilsome Weight, The brilliant Gem offends his weakly Sight; Perfumes grow nauseous then, nor can he bear Loud tuneful Notes, that us'd to charm his Ear. To please his Taste the Cook attempts in vain, When now each former Pleasure gives him Pain. Nor flowing Bowls, loud Laugh or Midnight Freik, Nor smutty Tale, delight the roving Rake; When Health forsakes him, all Diversions tire; There's nothing pleases, nothing can inspire A blythsome Smile; he shuns the Shine of Light, And broken Slumbers make a weary Night. If silent Sleep attempts to bring him Ease, His watching Fancy feels the whole Disease: He dreams a Mountain lies upon his Breast, Or that he flies the Fury of some Beast; Sees, at vast Distance, gushing from the Rocks, The cooling Stream,—while burning Thirst provokes Him, fainting, to climb up the craggy Edge, And drag his Limbs through many a thorny Hedge; Hangs o'er a Precipice, or sinks in Waves: And all the while he sweats, turns, starts and raves. How mad's that Man, push'd by his Passions wild, Who's of his greatest Happiness beguil'd; Who seems, whate'er he says, by Actions low, To court Disease, our Pleasure's greatest Foe? From Paris, deeply skill'd in nice Ragoos, In Oleos, Salmongundies and Hogoes, Montanus sends for Cooks, that his large Board May all invented Luxury afford: Health's never minded, while the Appetite Devours the spicy Death with much Delight. Mean time King Arthur's sav'ry knightd Loyn Appears a Clown, and's not allow'd to join The marinated Smelt, and Sturgeon Joles, Soup Vermecell, souc'd Turbet, Cray and Soals, Fowls a la daube, and Omelet of Eggs, The smother'd Coney, and bak'd Padocks Legs, Pullets a Bisk, and Orangedo Pye, The larded Peacock, and the Tarts de Moy, The Collard Veal, and Pike in Cassorole, Pigs a la Braise, the Tansy and Brusole; With many a hundred costly mingled Dish, Wherein the Moiety of Flesh or Fish Is wholly lost, and vitiate as the Taste Of them who eat the dangerous Repast; Until the feeble Stomach's over-cram'd, The Fibres weaken'd, and the Blood enflam'd. What aking Heads, what Spleen, and drowzy Eyes, From undigested Crudities arise? But when Montano's Paunch is over cloy'd, The Bagnio, or Emetic Wine's employ'd. These he imagines Methods the most sure, After a Surfeit, to complete a Cure: But never dreams how much the Balm of Life Is wasted by this forc'd unnat'ral Strife. Thus Peuther Vessel must by scouring wear, While Plate more free from Dross continues clear. Long unconsum'd the Oak can bear the Beams, Or lie for Ages firm beneath the Streams: But when alternately the Rain and Rays, Now dash, then dry the Plank, it soon decays. Luxurious Man! altho' thou'rt blest with Wealth, Why shouldst thou use it to destroy thy Health? Copy Mellantius, if you'd learn the Art, To feast your Friends, and keep the Souls alart, One good substantial British Dish or two, Which sweetly in their natural Juices flow, Only appear. And here no Danger's found, To tempt the Appetite beyond its Bound: And you may eat, or not, as you incline; And, as you please, drink Water, Beer or Wine. Here Hunger's safe, and gratefully appeas'd, The Spleen's forbid, and all the Spirits rais'd, And Guests arise regal'd, refresh'd and pleas'd. Grumaldo views, from rais'd Parters around, A thousand Acres of fat furrow'd Ground, And all his own;—but these no Pleasure yield, While Spleen hangs as a Fog o'er every Field: The lovely Landskip clad with gilded Corn, The Banks and Meads which Flowers and Groves adorn, No Relish have; his envious sullen Mind, Still on the Fret, complains his Fate's unkind: Something he wants which always flies his Reach, Which makes him groan beneath his spreading Beach. When all of Nature, silent, seem to shun Their Cares, and nod till the returning Sun; His envious Thoughts forbid refreshing Sleep, And on the Rack his hopeless Wishes keep: Fatigu'd and drumbly from the Down he flies, With skinny Cheek, pale Lips and blood-run Eyes. Thus toil'd with lab'ring Thoughts he looks agast, And tasteless loaths the nourishing Repast. Meager Disease an easy Passage finds, Where Joy's debarr'd, in such corroded Minds. Such take no care the Springs of Life to save, Neglect their Health, and quickly fill a Grave. Unlike gay Myrtle, who with chearful Air, Less envious, tho' less rich, no Slave to Care, Thinks what he has enough, and scorns to fret, While he sees Thousands less oblig'd to Fate, And oftner from his Station casts his Eye On those below him, than on them more high: Thus Envy finds no Access to his Breast, To sowr his gen'rous Joys, or break his Rest. He studies to do Actions just and kind, Which with the best Reflections chear the Mind: Which is the first Preservative of Health, To be preferr'd to Grandeur, Pride and Wealth. Let all who would pretend to common Sense, 'Gainst Pride and Envy still be on Defence. Who love their Health, nor would their Joys controul, Let them ne'er nurse such Furies in their Soul. Nor wait on strolling Phimos to the Stews, Phimos who by his livid Colour shews Him load with vile Diseases, which are fixt Upon his Bones, and with his Vitals mixt. Does that Man wear the Image of his God, Who drives to Death on such an ugly Road? Behold him clad, like any bright Bridegroom, In richest Labours of the British Loom; Embroider'd o'er with Gold, whilst Lace or Lawn Waves down his Breast, and Rufles o'er his Hand, Set off with Art, which vilely he employs In Sinks of Death, for low dear purchas'd Joys: He grasps the blasted Shadow of the Fair, Whose sickly Look, vile Breath, and falling Hair, The flag'd Embrace, and mercenary Squeeze, The twangs of Guilt, and terrors of Disease, Might warn him to beware, if wild Desire Had not set all his thoughtless Soul in Fire. O poor mistaken Youth! to drain thy Purse, To gain the most malignant humane Curse! Think on thy Flannel, and Mercurial Dose, And future Pains, to save thy Nerve and Nose. Think, heedless Wight, how thy infected Veins May plague thee many a Day with loathsome Pains, When the French Foe his woeful Way has made, And all within has dire Detachments laid; There long may lurk, and, with Destruction keen, Do horrid Havock e'er the Symptom's seen. But learn to dread the poisonous Disease, When Heaviness and Spleen thy Spirits seise; When feeble Limbs to serve thee will decline, And languid Eyes no more with Sparkles shine; The Roses from thy Cheek will blasted fade, And leave a dull Complexion like the Lead: Then, then expect the terrible Attack Upon thy Head, thy Conduit, Nose and Back; Pains through thy Shoulders, Arms, and Throat and Shins, Will threaten Death, and damp thee with thy Sins. How frightful is the Loss, and the Disgrace, When it destroys the Beauties of the Face! When the arch'd Nose in rotten Ruin lyes, And all the Venom flames around the Eyes; When th'Uvula has got it's mortal Wound, And Tongue and Lips form Words without a Sound; When Hair drops off, and Bones corrupt and bare, Through ulcerated Tags of Muscles stare. But vain we sing Instruction to his Ear, Who's no more Slave to Reason than to Fear; Hurried by Passion, and o'ercome with Wine, He rushes headlong on his vile Design: The nauseous Bolus, and the bitter Pill, A Month of spitting, and the Surgeon's Bill, Are now forgot, whilst he:—But here 'tis best To let the Curtain drop, and hide the rest Of the coarse Scene, too shocking for the Sight Of modest Eyes and Ears, that take Delight To hear with Pleasure Urban's Praises sung, Urban the kind, the prudent, gay and young, Who moves a Man, and wears a rosie Smile, That can the fairest of a Heart beguile: A virtuous Love delights him with it's Grace, Which soon he'll find in Myra's lov'd Embrace, Enjoying Health, with all it's lovely Train Of Joys, free from Remorse, or Shame or Pain. But Talpo sighs with matrimonial Cares, His Cheeks wear Wrinkles, Silver grow his Hairs; Before old Age, his Health decays apace, And very rarely Smiles clear up his Face. Talpo's a Fool, there's hardly Help for that, He scarcely knows himself what he'd be at: He's avaritious to the last Degree, And thinks his Wife and Children makes too free With his dear Idol; this creates his Pain, And breeds Convulsions in his narrow Brain. He always startled at approaching Fate, And often jealous of his vertuous Mate; Is ever anxious, shuns his Friends, to save: Thus soon he'll fret himself into a Grave; There let him rot,—worthless the Muse's Lays, Who never read one Poem in his Days. I sing to Marlus, Marlus who regards The well mean'd Verse, and generously rewards The Poet's Care; observe now, if you can, Ought in his Carriage, does not speak the Man: To him his many a Winter wedded Wife Appears the greatest Solace of his Life. He views his Offspring with indulgent Love, Who his superior Conduct all approve. Smooth glide his Hours, at Fifty he's less old, Than some who have not half the Number told. The chearing Glass he with right Friends can share, But shuns the deep Debauch with cautious Care. His Sleeps are sound, he sees the Morning rise, And lifts his Face with Pleasure to the Skies; And quaffs the Health that's born on Zephyr's Wings, Or gushes from the Rock in Limpid Springs. From fragrant Plains he gains the chearing Smell, While ruddy Beams all distant Dumps repell. The whole of Nature, to a Mind thus turn'd, Enjoying Health, with Sweetness seems adorn'd. To him the whistling Ploughman's artless Tune, The bleeting Flocks, the Oxens hollow Crune, The warbling Notes of the small chirping Throng, Delight him more than the Italian Song. To him the cheapest Dish of rural Fare, And Water cool in place of Wine more rare, Shall prove a Feast. On Straw he'll find more Ease Than on the Down, even with the least Disease. Whoever's tempted to transgress the Line, By Moderation fix'd to enlivening Wine; View Macro wasted long before his Time, Whose Head, bow'd down, proclaims his liquid Crime. The Purple Dye, with Ruby Pimples mixt, As Witnesses upon his Face are fixt. A constant Fever wastes his Strength away, And Limbs enervate gradually decay. The Gout and Palsy follow in the Rear, And make his Being burthensome to bear. His squeamish Stomach loaths the savory Sey, And nought but Liquids now can find their Way To animate his Strength, which daily flies, Till the young Drunkard's past all Hope, and dies. To practise what we preach, O Goddess-born! Assist thy Slave, lest Bacchanalians scorn Thy Inspiration, if the tempting Grape Shall form the hollow Eye, and Idiot Gape. But let no wretched Misers, who repine, And wish there were not such a Juice as Wine, Imagine here that we are so profane To think that Heaven gave plenteous Vines in vain. No; since there's Plenty, Cups may sparkling flow, And we may drink till our rais'd Spirits glow. They will befriend our Health, while chearful Rounds Incline to Mirth, and keep their proper Bounds. Fools should not drink, I own, who still wish more, And know not when 'tis proper to give o'er. Dear Britons, let no Morning Drinks deceive Your Appetites, which else at Noon would crave Such proper Aliments, as can support At Even your hearty Bottle, Health and Sport. Next view we Sloth (too oft the Child of Wealth) A seeming Friend, but real Foe to Health. Lethargus loll's his lazy Hours away, His Eyes are drowsy, and his Lips are blae; His soft enfeebl'd Hands supinely hing, And shaking Knees unus'd, together cling: Close by the Fire his Easy-Chair stands, In which all Day he snotters, nods and yawns. Sometimes he'll drone at Piquet, hoping Gain, But you must deal his Cards, that's too much Pain. He speaks but seldom, puffs at every Pause, Words being a Labour to his Tongue and Jaws. Nor must his Friends discourse above their Breath, For the least Noise stounds through his Ears like Death. He causes stop each Cranny in his Room, And heaps on Cloaths, to save him from the Rheum: Free Air he dreads as his most dangerous Foe, And trembles at the Sight of Ice or Snow. The Warming-Pan each Night glows o'er his Sheets, Then he beneath a Load of Blankets sweats; The which (instead of shutting) opes the Door, And lets in Cold at each dilated Pore. Thus does the Sluggard Health and Vigour waste, With heavy Indolence; till at the last, Sciatick, Jaundice, Dropsie, or the Stone, Alternate makes the lazy Lubard grone. But active Hilaris much rather loves, With eager Stride to trace the Wilds and Groves; To start the Covy, or the bounding Roe, Or work destructive Reynard's Overthrow: The Race delights him, Horses are his Care, And a stout ambling Pad his easiest Chair. Sometimes to firm his Nerves he'll plunge the Deep, And with expanded Arms the Billows sweep: Then on the Links, or in the Estler Walls, He drives the Gowff, or strikes the Tennis Balls. From Ice with Pleasure he can brush the Snow, And run rejoycing with his Curling Throw; Or send the whizzing Arrow from the String, A manly Game, A Poem on seeing the Archers playing at the Rovers. which by it self I sing. Thus chearfully he'll walk, ride, dance or game, Nor mind the Northern Blast, or Southern Flame. East Winds may blow, and sullen Fogs may fall, But his hale Constitution's Proof to all. He knows no Change of Weather by a Corn, Nor minds the black, the blew or ruddy Morn. Here let no Youth extravagantly given, Who values neither Gold, nor Health, nor Heaven, Think that our Song encourages the Crime Of setting deep, or wasting too much Time On furious Game; which makes the Passions boil, And the fair Mean of Health a weakning Toil, By Violence excessive, or the Pain Which ruin'd Losers ever must sustain. Our Hilaris despises Wealth so won; Nor does he love to be himself undone, But from his Sport, can with a Smile retire, And warm his Genius at Apollo's Fire; Find useful Learning in the inspired Strains, And bless the generous Poet for his Pains. Thus he by Lit'rature and Exercise, Improves his Soul, and wards off each Disease. Health's op'ner Foes, we've taken Care to show, Which make Diseases in full Torrents flow: But when these Ills intrude, do what we will, Then hope for Health from Clark's approven Skill; To such well seen in Nature's darker Laws, That for Disorders can assign a Cause: Who know the Virtues of salubrious Plants, And what each different Constitution wants, Apply for Health.—But shun the vagrant Quack, Who gulls the Crowd with Andrew's comick Clack; Or him that charges Gazettes with his Bills, His Anadoyns, Elixirs, Tinctures, Pills, Who rarely ever cures, but often kills. Nor trust thy Life to the old Woman's Charms, Who binds with knotted Tape thy Legs or Arms, Which they pretend will purple Fevers cool; And thus impose on some believing Fool. When Agues shake, or Fevers raise a Flame, Let your Physician be a Man of Fame; Of well known Learning, and in good Respect, For Prudence, Honour, and a Mind erect: Nor scrimply save from what's to Merit duè; He saves your whole Estate who succours you. Be grateful, Britons, for your temp'rate Beams, Your fertile Plains, green Hills, and silver Streams, O'erclad with Corns, with Groves, and many a Mead; Where rise green Heights, where Herds in Millions feed: Here useful Plenty mitigates our Care, And Health with freshest Sweets embalms the Air. Upon those Shores, where Months of circling Rays Glance feebly on the Snow, and frozen Bays; Where, wrapt in Fur, the starving Lapland Brood Scarce keep the Cold from curdling of their Blood: Here meager Want, in all its pinching Forms, Combines with lengthned Night and bleakest Storms, To combate joyful Health and calm Repose, Which from an equal Warmth and Plenty flows. Yet rather, O great Ruler of the Day, Bear me to Weygate, or to Hudson's Bay, Than scorch me on these dry and blasted Plains, Where Rays direct inflame the boiling Veins Of gloomy Negroes, who're oblig'd to breathe A thickned Air, with pestilential Death, Where range out o'er th'unhospitable Wastes, The Hunger edg'd, and fierce devouring Beasts; Where Serpents crawl, which sure Destruction bring, Or in the envenom'd Tooth or forked Sting; Where fleeting Sands ne'er yield to industrious Toil The golden Sheave, or Plants for Wine and Oil: Health must be here a Stranger, where the Rage Of fev'rish Beams forbid a lengthen'd Age. Ye Dutch, enjoy your Dams, your Bulwarks boast, And war with Neptune for a sandy Coast, Whilst frighted by these deep tumultuous Powers, You scarce dare sleep in your subaqueous Bowers: Raise high your Beds, and shun your croaking Frogs, And battle with Tobacco Smoak your Fogs; Soak on your Stoves, with Spirits charge your Veins, To ward off Agues and Rheumatick Pains. Let the proud Spaniard strut on naked Hills, And vainly trace the Plain for Christal Rills, Starve on a Sallet, or a Garlick Head, Pray for his daily Roots, not daily Bread; Be sowr, and jealous of his Friend and Wife, Till Want and Spleen cut short his Threed of Life. Whilst we on our auspicious Island find What e'er can please the Sense, or chear the Mind. Blest Queen of Isles! with a devout Regard, Allow me to kneel down and kiss thy Sward, Thy Flow'ry Sward, and offer Heaven a Vow, Which Gratitude and Love to thee makes due: If e'er I from thy Healthful Limits stray, Or by a Wish, or Word, a Thought betray, Against thy Int'rest, or thy fair Renown; May never Daphne furnish me a Crown, Nor may the first-rate Judges of our Isle, Or read or on my blythsome Numbers smile. Thalia here, sweet as the Light, retir'd, Commanding me to sing what she'd inspir'd, And never mind the glooming Criticks Bray; The Song was her's,—she spoke,—and I obey. Robert, Richy, and Sandy; A PASTORAL On the Death of MATTHEW PRIOR Esq; Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable Person design'd by the Old Robert late Earl of Oxford. Shepherd. Robert the good, by a' the Swains rever'd, Wise are his Words, like Siller is his Beard: Near saxty shining Simmers he has seen, Tenting his Hirsle on the Moor-land Green: Unshaken yet with mony a Winter's Wind, Stout are his Limbs, and youthfu' is his Mind. But now he droops, ane wad be wae to see Him sae cast down; ye wadna trow 'tis he. By break of Day he seeks the dowy Glen, That he may Scowth to a' his Mourning len: Nane but the clinty Craigs and scrogy Briers Were Witnesses of a' his Granes and Tears; Howder'd wi' Hills a Crystal Burnie ran, Where twa young Shepherds fand the good auld Man: Kind Richy Spec, a Friend to a' distrest, And Sandy wha of Shepherds sings the best; With friendly Looks they speer'd wherefore he mourn'd, He rais'd his Head, and sighing thus return'd. ROBERT. O Matt! poor Matt!—My Lads, e'en take a Skair Of a' my Grief;—Sweet singing Matt's nae mair. Ah Heavens! did e'er this lyart Head of mine Think to have seen the cauldrife Mools on thine! RICHY. My Heart misga'e me, when I came this Way, His Dog its lane sat yowling on a Brae; I cry'd, Isk-isk,—poor Ringwood,—sairy Man; He wag'd his Tail, cour'd near, and lick'd my Hand: I clap'd his Head, which eas'd a wee his Pain; But soon's I gade away, he youl'd again. Poor kindly Beast. Ah Sirs! how sic should be Mair tender-hearted mony a time than we! SANDY. Last Ouk I dream'd my Tupe that bears the Bell, And paths the Snaw, out o'er a high Craig fell, And brak his Leg.—I started frae my Bed, Awak'd, and leugh.—Ah! now my Dream it's red. How dreigh's our Cares, our Joys how soon away, Like Sun-blinks on a cloudy Winter's Day! Flow fast, ye Tears, ye have free Leave for me; Dear sweet-tongu'd Matt, Thousands shall greet for thee. ROBERT. Thanks to my Friends, for ilka briny Tear Ye shed for him; he to us a' was dear: Sandy, I'm eas'd to see thee look sae wan; Ricky, thy Sighs bespeak the kindly Man. RICHY. But twice the Simmer's Sun has thaw'd the Snaw, Since frae our Heights Eddie Secretary Addison, whose Obsequies are sung in a Scots Pastoral Vol. I. p. 106. was tane awa': Fast Matt has follow'd.—Of sic twa bereft, To smooth our Sauls, alake! wha have we left! Waes me! o'er short a Tack of six is given, But wha may contradict the Will of Heaven? Yet mony a Year he liv'd to hear the Dale Sing o'er his Sangs, and tell his merry Tale. Last Year I had a stately tall Ash-tree, Braid were its Branches, a sweet Shade to me; I thought it might have flowrish'd on the Brae, (Tho' past its Prime) yet twenty Years or sae: But ae rough Night the blat'ring Winds blew snell, Torn frae its Roots, adown it souchan fell; Twin'd of its Nourishment, it lifeless lay, Mixing its wither'd Leaves amang the Clay. Sae flowrish'd Matt: But where's the Tongue can tell How fair he grew? how much lamented fell? SANDY. How snackly cou'd he gi'e a Fool Reproof, E'en wi' a canty Tale he'd tell aff loof? How did he Warning to the Dosen'd sing, By auld Purganty, and the Dutchman's Ring? And Lucky's Siller Ladle shaws how aft Our greatest Wishes are but vain and daft. The wad-be Wits, he bade them a' but pap Their crazy Heads into Tam Tinman's Shap; There they wad see a Squirrel wi' his Bells Ay wrestling up, yet rising like themsells. Thousands of Things he wittily cou'd say, With Fancy strang, and Saul as clear as Day; Smart were his Tales: But where's the Tongue can tell How blyth he was? how much lamented fell? RICHY. And as he blythsome was, sae was he wise, Our Laird himsell wa'd aft take his Advice. E'en Cheek for Chew he'd seat him 'mang them a', And tak his Mind 'bout kittle Points of Law. When Lewis XIV. King of France. Clan Red-yards, ye ken, wi' wicked Feud, Had skaild of ours, but mair of his ain Blood; When I, and mony mae that were right crouse, Wad fain about his Lugs have burnt his House: Yet Lady ANNE, a Woman meek and kind, A Fae to Wiers, and of a peacefu' Mind; Since mony in the Fray had got their dead, To make the Peace, our Friend was sent wi' Speed. The very Faes had for him just Regard, Tho' sair he jyb'd their Boileau, whose Ode on the taking Namure by the French 1692 he burlesqu'd, on its being retaken by the British 1695. foremost singing Bard. Careful was Matt: But where's the Tongue can tell How wise he was? how much lamented fell? SANDY. Wha cou'd, like him, in a short Sang define The bonny Lass, and her young Lover's Pine. I'll ne'er forget that ane he made on May, Wha brang the poor blate Symie to his Clay; To gratifie the paughty Wench's Pride, The silly Shepherd bow'd, obey'd and dy'd. Sic constant Lasses as the Nit Brown Maid, Shall never want just Praises duly paid; Sic claim'd his Sang, and still it was his Care With pleasing Words to guide and ruse the Fair. How sweet his Voice, when Beauty was in View, Smooth ran his Lines, ay grac'd wi' something new; Nae Word stood wrang: But where's the Tongue can tell How saft he sung? how much lamented fell? RICHY. And when he had a mind to be mair grave, A Minister nae better cou'd behave; Far out of Sight of sic he aften flew, When he of haly Wonders took a View. Well cou'd he praise the Power that made us a', And bids us in Return but tent his Law; Wha guides us when we're waking or asleep, With thousand times mair Care than we our Sheep. While he of Pleasure, Power and Wisdom sang, My Heart lap high, my Lugs wi' Pleasure rang: These to repeat, braid-spoken I wad spill, Altho' I should employ my utmost Skill. He towr'd aboon: But ah! what Tongue can tell How high he flew? how much lamented fell? ROBERT. My Bennison, dear Lads, light on ye baith, Wha ha'e sae true a Feeling of our Skaith: O Sandy, draw his Likeness in smooth Verse, As well ye can;—then Shepherds shall rehearse His Merit, while the Sun mets out the Day, While Ews shall bleet, and little Lambkins mae. I've been a Fauter, now three Days are past, While I for Grief have hardly broke my fast: Come to my Shiel, there let's forget our Care, I dinna want a Rowth of Country-fare, Sic as it is, ye're welcome to a Skair. Besides, my Lads, I have a Browst of Tip, As good as ever wuish a Shepherd's Lip; We'll tak a Scour o't to put aff our Pain, For a' our Tears and Sighs are but in vain: Come, help me up;—yon sooty Cloud shores Rain. To Mr. Pope. Three times I've read your Iliad o'er: The first time pleas'd me well; New Beauties unobserv'd before, Next pleas'd me better still. Again I try'd to find a Flaw, Examin'd ilka Line; The third time pleas'd me best of a', The Labour seem'd divine. Henceforward I'll not tempt my Fate, On dazling Rays to stare, Lest I should tine dear Self-conceit, And read and write nae mair. EPISTLE To the Honourable DUNCAN FORBES, Lord Advocate. Shut in a Closet six Foot square, No fash'd with meikle Wealth or Care, I pass the live lang Day; Yet some ambitious Thoughts I have, Which will attend me to my Grave, Sic busked Baits they lay. These keep my Fancy on the Wing, Something that's blyth and snack to sing, And smooth the runkled Brow: Thus Care I happily beguile, Hoping a Plaudit and a Smile, Frae best of Men, like You. You, wha in kittle Casts of State, When Property demands Debate, Can right what is dung wrang; Yet blythly can, when ye think fit, Enjoy your Friend, and judge the Wit And Slidness of a Sang. How mony, your Reverse, unblest, Whase Minds gae wandring through a Mist, Proud as the Thief in Hell, Pretend, forsooth, they're gentle Fowk, 'Cause Chance gi'es them of Gear the Yowk, And better Cheils the Shell? I've seen a We'an aft vex it sell, And greet, because it was not tall: Heez'd on a Board, O than! Rejoicing in the artfu' Height, How smirky look'd the little Wight! And thought it sell a Man. Sic Bairns are some blawn up a wee With Splendor, Wealth and Quality, Upon these Stilts grown vain; They o'er the Pows of poor Fowk stride, And neither are to had nor bide, Thinking this Height their ain. Now shou'd ane speer at sic a Puff, What gars thee look sae big and bluff? Is't an attending Menzie? Or fifty Dishes on your Table? Or fifty Horses in your Stable? Or Heaps of glancing Cunzie? Are these the things thou ca's thy sell? Come, vain gigantick Shadow, tell, If thou sayest, Yes—I'll shaw Thy Picture.—Mean's thy silly Mind, Thy Wit's a croil, thy Judgment blind, And Love worth nought ava. Accept our Praise, ye nobly born, Whom Heaven takes Pleasure to adorn With ilka manly Gift; In Courts or Camps to serve your Nation, Warm'd with that generous Emulation Which your Forbears did lift. In Duty, with Delight, to You Th'inferior World justly bow, While You're the maist deny'd; Yet shall Your Worth be ever priz'd, When struting Nathings are despis'd With a' their stinkan Pride. This to set aff as I am able, I'll frae a Frenchman thigg a Fable, And busk it in a Plaid: And tho' it be a Bairn Mons. la Motte, who has written lately a curious Collection of Fables, from which the following is imitated. of Motte's, When I have taught it to speak Scots, I am its second Dad. “Twa Books, near Neighbours in a Shop, “The tane a guilded Turky Fop, “The tither's Face was weather-beaten, “And Caf-skin Jacket sair worm-eaten. “The Corky, proud of his braw Suit, “Curl'd up his Nose, and thus cry'd out, “Ah! place me on some fresher Binks, “Figh! how this mouldy Creature stinks! “How can a gentle Book like me “Endure sic scoundrel Company? “What may Fowk say to see me cling “Sae close to this auld ugly thing; “But that I'm of a simple Spirit, “And disregard my proper Merit? “Quoth Gray-baird, Whisht, Sir, with your Din, “For a' your meritorious Skin, “I doubt if you be worth within. “For as auld fashion'd as I look, “May be I am the better Book. “O Heavens! I canna thole the Clash “Of this impertinent auld Hash; “I winna stay ae Moment langer. “My Lord, please to command your Anger; “Pray only let me tell you that— “What wad this insolent be at! “Rot out your Tongue—Pray', Master Symmer, “Remove me frae this dinsome Rhimer: “If you regard your Reputation, “And us of a distinguish'd Station, “Hence frae this Beast let me be hurried, “For with his Stour and Stink I'm worried. “Scarce had he shook his paughty Crap, “When in a Customer did pap; “He up douse Stanza lifts, and ey's him, “Turns o'er his Leaves, admires, and buys him: “This Book, said he, is good and scarce, “The Saul of Sense in sweetest Verse. “But reading Title of gilt cleathing, “Cries, Gods! wha buys this bonny naithing? “Nought duller e'er was put in Print: “Wow! what a deal of Turky's tint!” Now, Sir, t'apply what we've invented, You are the Buyer represented: And, may your Servant hope My Lays shall merit your Regard, I'll thank the Gods for my Reward, And smile at ilka Fop. The Clock and Dial. Ae Day a Clock wad brag a Dial, And put his Qualities to trial; Spake to him thus,—My Neibour, pray, Can'st tell me what's the time of Day? The Dial said, “I dinna ken.”— Alake! what stand ye there for then?— “I wait here till the Sun shines bright, “For nought I ken but by his Light.” Wait on, quoth Clock, I scorn his Help, Baith Night and Day my lane I skelp; Wind up my Weights but anes a-week, Without him I can gang and speak: Nor like an useless Sumph I stand, But constantly wheel round my Hand: Hark, hark, I strike just now the Hour; And I am right, Ane,—Twa,—Three,—Four. While thus the Clock was boasting loud, The bleezing Sun brak throw a Cloud; The Dial, faithfu' to his Guide, Spake Truth, and laid the Thumper's Pride: “Ye see, said he, I've dung you fair, “'Tis four Hours and three Quarters mair. “My Friend, he added, count again, “And learn a wee to be less vain: “Ne'er brag of constant clavering Cant, “And that you Answers never want; “For you're not ay to be believ'd: “Wha trust to you may be deceiv'd. “Be counsell'd to behave like me; “For when I dinna clearly see, “I always own I dinna ken; “And that's the way of wisest Men.” AN ODE To the Memory of Lady Margaret Anstruther. All in her Bloom the graceful Fair, LUCINDA, leaves this mortal Round; Her Loss a thousand Mourners share, And Beauty feels the cruel Wound. Now Grief and Tears o'er all our Joys prevail, Viewing her Rosy Cheeks all cold and pale. Thus some fair Star distinguish'd bright, Which decks the Heavens, and guides the Main; When Clouds obscure its glorious Light, It leaves the gloomy World in Pain. So sudden Death has vail'd LUCINDA's Eyes, And left us lost in Darkness and Surprize. Nor Sweetness, Beauty, Youth nor Wealth, Nor Blood, tho' nobly high it springs; Not Virtue's self can purchase Health, When Death severe his Summons brings: Else might the fair LUCINDA, young and gay, Have blest the World with a much longer Stay. But say, sweet Shade, was it thy Choice To leave this low unconstant Globe; Tyr'd with its vain, its jangling Noise, Thou wisely dropt thy humane Robe: Or tell us, Guardian Angels, tell us true, Did ye not claim her hence as one of you? Yes, well we know it is your Way, When here below such Beings shine, To gridge us even our earthly Clay, Which form'd like her becomes divine. Such you demand, and free from Cares and Fears, Unmindful of our fruitless Sighs and Tears. Yet daign, ye Friends to humane Kind, The lonely Consort to attend; O sooth the Anguish of his Mind, And let his killing Sorrows end. Tell him, his Sighs and Mourning to asswage, Each Day she dwelt with him was worth an Age. Ye lovely Virgins who excell, Ye Fair to whom such Strains belong, In melting Notes her Beauties tell, And weep her Virtues in a Song: See that ye place her Merit in true Light; For singing her's, your own will shine more bright. Let East and West, and South and North, Aloud the mournful Musick hear, How Beauty's fallen beyond the Forth; Let Britain's Genius Cypress Wear. Yet Britain's happy, who such Beauty yields, As forc'd from her's, will grace Elysium's Fields. ELEGY On the Right Honourable James Lord Carnegie, Who died the 7th January 1722, the Eighth Year of his Age. As Poets feign, and Painters draw, Love and the Paphian Bride; Sae we the fair SOUTHESKA saw, CARNEGIE by her Side. Now sever'd frae his Sweets by Death, Her Grief wha can express? What Muse can tell the waefu' Skaith, Or Mother's deep Distress! Sae Roses wither in their Buds, Kill'd by an Eastlen Blast, And sweetest Dawns in May with Clouds And Storms are soon o'ercast. Ah checquer'd Life! Ae Day gives Joy, The niest our Hearts maun bleed: Heaven caus'd a Seraph turn a Boy, Now gars us trow he's dead. Wha can reflect on's ilka Grace, The Sweetness of his Tongue, His manly Looks, his lovely Face, And Judgment ripe sae young; And yet forbear to make a doubt, As did the Royal Swain, When he with Grief of Heart cry'd out, That Man was made in vain? Mortals the Ways of Providence But very scrimply scan; The changing Scene eludes the Sense And Reasonings of Man. How mony Thousands ilka Year, Of hopefu' Children, crave Our Love and Care, then disappear, To glut a gaping Grave. What is this Grave? A Wardrobe poor, Which hads our rotting Duds; Th'immortal Mind, serene and pure, Is cleath'd aboon the Clouds. Then cease to grieve, dejected Fair, You had him but in trust; He was your beauteous Son, your Heir, Yet still ae haff was Dust. The other to its native Skies Now wings its happy Way; With glorious Speed and Joy he flys, There blessfully to stray. CARNEGIE then but changes Clay, For fair Celestial Rays: He mounts up to eternal Day, And, as he parts, he says, Adieu, Mamma, forget my tender Fate, These rushing Tears are vain, they flow too late. This said, he hasted hence with pleasing Joy; I saw the Gods embrace their darling Boy. AN ODE Sacred to the Memory of the Right Honourable ANNE Lady Gairlies. How vain are our Attempts to know? How poor, alas! is Reason's Skill? We blindly wander here below, Yet fondly search Heaven's secret Will. Each Day we see the Young, the Great, the Small, The Good, the Bad, without Distinction, fall. Yet such as have the Rest out-shin'd, We should be faulty to neglect; Each Grace of beauteous GARLIA's Mind Deserves the Muse's high Respect. But how shall she such Worth and Goodness paint? A loving Daughter, virtuous Wife and Saint? Some Seraph who in endless Day With Themes sublime employ the Lyre, Dart in my Breast a shining Ray, And all my Soul with her inspire; Else sing your selves so fair a Frame and Mind, As now supplies a Place among your Kind. As we the glorious Sun admire, Whose Beams make ev'ry Joy arise; Yet dare not view the dazling Fire, Without much hazarding our Eyes: So did her Beauties ev'ry Heart allure, While her bright Virtues kill'd each Thought impure. She breath'd more Sweetness than the East, While ev'ry Sentence was divine; Her Smiles could calm each jarring Breast; Her Soul was a Celestial Mine, Where all the precious Veins of Virtue lay; Too vast a Treasure long to lodge in Clay. Tho' sprung from an She was Daughter of the Earl Marischal of Scotland. heroick Race, Which from the World Respect does claim; Yet wanted she no borrowed Grace, Her own demands immortal Fame: Worthy as those who shun the vulgar Roads, Start from the Crowd, and rise amongst the Gods. Such Pains as weaker Minds possess, Could in her Breast no Access find; But lowly Meekness did confess A steady and superior Mind. Unmov'd she bore these Honours due the Great, Nor could have been depress'd with a more humble Fate. As to the Fields the Huntsman hies, With joyful Shouts he wakes the Morn; While Nature smiles, serene the Skies, Swift fly his Hounds, shrill blows his Horn: When suddenly the thund'ring Cloud pours Rain, Defaces Day, and drives him from the Plain. Thus young BRIGANTIUS circling Arms Grasp'd all that's lovely to his Heart, Rejoyc'd o'er his dear ANNA's Charms; But not expecting soon to part: When rigid Fate, for Reasons known above, Snatch'd from his Breast the Object of his Love. Ah GARLIES! once the happiest Man, Than e'er before BRIGANTINE Chief, Now sever'd from your lovely ANNE, 'Tis hard indeed to stem your Grief: Yet mind what you might often from her hear, What Heaven designs, submissive we should bear. Oh! ne'er forget that tender Care, Those Heaven-born Thoughts she did employ, To point those Ways how you may share Above with her immortal Joy. Such a bright Pattern of what's Good and Great, Even Angels need not blush to imitate. THE Lovely Lass and the Mirror. A Nymph, with ilka Beauty grac'd, Ae Morning by her Toilet plac'd, Where the leal-hearted Looking-glass With Truths addresst the lovely Lass;— To do ye Justice, heavenly Fair, Amaist in Charms ye may compare With Venus sell.—But mind amaist: For tho' you're happily possest Of ilka Grace which claims Respect, Yet I see Faults ye should correct; I own they only Trifles are, Yet of Importance to the Fair. What signifies that Patch o'er braid, With which your rosie Cheek's o'erlaid? Your natural Beauties you beguile, By that too much affected Smile: Saften that Look,—move ay with Ease, And you can never fail to please. Those kind Advices she approv'd, And mair her Monitor she lov'd; Till in came Visitants a Threave: To entertain them, she maun leave Her Looking-glass.—They fleetching praise Her Looks,—her Dress,—and a' she says, Be't right or wrang; she's hale compleat, And fails in naithing fair or sweet. Sae much was said, the bonny Lass Forgat her faithfu' Looking-glass. CLARINDA, this dear Beauty's You, The Mirror is, Ane good and wise, Wha, by his Counsels just, can shew How Nobles may to Greatness rise. God bless the Wark:—If you're opprest By Parasites with fause Design, Then will sic faithfu' Mirrors best These Underplotters countermine. JUPITER's Lottery. Anes JOVE, by ae great Act of Grace, Wad gratify his humane Race, And order'd Hermes, in his Name, With Tout of Trumpets to proclaim A Royal Lott'ry frae the Skies, Where ilka Ticket was a Prize. Nor was there Need for Ten per Cent, To pay Advance for Money lent: Nor Brokers nor Stockjobbers here Were thol'd to cheat Fowk of their Gear. The first-rate Benefits were, Health, Pleasures, Honours, Empire and Wealth; But happy he to whom wad fa' Wisdom, the highest Prize of a': Hopes of attaining Things the best, Made up the maist feck of the rest. Now ilka Ticket sald with Ease, At Altars for a Sacrifice; JOVE a' receiv'd, Ky, Gates and Ews, Moor-cocks, Lambs, Dows or Bawby-rows; Nor wad debar e'en a poor Droll, Wha nought cou'd gi'e but his Parol. Sae kind was he no to exclude Poor Wights for want of Wealth or Blood; Even whiles the Gods, as Record tells, Bought several Tickets for themsells. When Fou and Lots put in the Wheel, Aft were they turn'd, to mix them well; Blind Chance to draw JOVE order'd syne, That nane with Reason might repine: He drew, and Mercury was Clark, The Number, Prize and Name to mark. Now Hopes by Millions fast came forth, But seldom Prizes of mair Worth, Sic as Dominion, wealth and State, True Friends, and Lovers fortunate. Wisdom, at last, the greatest Prize, Comes up:—Aloud Clark Hermes crys,— Number Ten Thousand,—Come, let's see The Person blest.—Quoth Pallas, ME.— Then a' the Gods for Blythness sang, Throw Heaven glad Acclamations rang; While Mankind grumbling laid the wyte On them, and ca'd the hale a Byte. Yes! cry'd ilk ane, with sobing Heart, Kind JOVE has play'd a Parent's Part, Wha did this Prize to Pallas send, While we're sneg'd off at the Wob End. Soon to their Clamours JOVE took tent, To punish which, to wark he went, He straight with Follies fill'd the Wheel, In Wisdom's Place they did as well; For ilka ane wha Folly drew, In their Conceit, a' Sages grew: Sae thus contented, a' retir'd, And ilka Fool himself admir'd. The Miser and Minos. Short syne there was a wretched Miser, With pinching had scrap'd up a Treasure; Yet frae his Hoords he doughtna take As much wou'd buy a Mutton-stake, Or take a Glass to comfort Nature; But scrimply fed on Crumbs and Water: In short, he famish'd 'midst his Plenty; Which made surviving Kindred canty, Wha scarcely for him pat on Black, And only in his Loof a Plack, Which even they grudg'd: Sic is the Way Of them wha fa' upon the Prey; They'll scarce row up the Wretch's Feet, Sae scrimp they make his Winding-sheet, Tho' he shou'd leave a vast Estate, And Heaps of Gowd like Arthur's Seat. Well, down the starving Ghaist did sink, Till it fell on the Stygian Brink; Where auld Van Charon stood and raught His wither'd Loof out for his Fraught; But them that wanted wherewitha', He dang them back to stand and blaw. The Miser lang being us'd to save, Fand this, and wadna Passage crave, But shaw'd the Ferry-man a Knack, Jumpt in,—swam o'er,—and hain'd his Plack. Charon might damn, and sink and rore; But a' in vain,—he gain'd the Shore,— Arriv'd:—The three pow'd Dog of Hell Gowl'd terrible a treeple Yell; Which rouz'd the snaky Sisters three, Wha furious on this Wight did flie, Wha'd play'd the Smugler on their Coast, By which Pluto his Dues had lost: Then brought him for this Trick sae hainous Afore the Bench of Justice Minos. The Case was new, and very kittle, Which puzzl'd a' the Court na little; Thought after Thought with unco' Speed Flew round within the Judge's Head, To find what Punishment was due For sic a daring Crime and new. Shou'd he the Plague of Tantal feel, Or stented be on Ixion's Wheel, Or stung wi' bauld Prometheus' Pain, Or help Sysiph to row his Stane, Or sent amang the wicked Rout To fill the Tub that ay rins out? No, no, continues Minos, no, Weak are our Punishments below, For sic a Crime;—he maun be hurl'd Straight back again into the World. I sentence him to see and hear, What Use his Friends make of his Gear. The Ape and the Leopard. The Ape and Leopard, Beasts for Show, The first a Wit, the last a Beau; To make a Penny at a Fair, Advertis'd a' their Parts sae rare. The tane gae out with meikle Wind, His Beauty 'boon the brutal Kind; Said he, I'm kend baith far and near, Even Kings are pleas'd when I appear: And when I yield my vital Puff, Queens of my Skin will make a Muff; My Fur sae delicate and fine, With various Spots does sleekly shine.— Now Lads and Lasses fast did rin To see the Beast with bonny Skin: His Keeper shaw'd him round about; They saw him soon, and soon came out. But Master Monky with an Air Hapt out, and thus harangu'd the Fair; Come, Gentlemen, and Ladies bonny, I'll give ye Pastime for your Money: I can perform, to raise your wonder, Of pawky Tricks mae than a hunder. My Cousin Spottie, true he's braw, He has a curious Suit to shaw, And nathing mair.—But frae my Mind Ye shall blyth Satisfaction find. Sometimes I'll act a Cheil that's dull, Look thoughtfu', grave, and wag my Scull; Then mimick a light-headed Rake, When on a Tow my Houghs I shake: Sometime, like modern Monks, I'll seem To make a Speech, and nathing mean. But come away, ye needna speer What ye're to pay; I'se no be dear: And if ye grudge for want of Sport, I'll give it back t'ye at the Port. The Ape succeeded, in Fowk went,— Stay'd long,—and came out well content. Sae much will Wit and Spirit please, Beyond our Shape, and brawest Claiths. How mony, ah! of our fine Gallants Are only Leopard in their Talents! The Ass and Brock. Upon a time a solemn Ass Was dand'ring throw a narrow Pass, Where he forgether'd with a Brock, Wha him saluted frae a Rock; Speer'd how he did,—how Markets gade,— What's a' ye'r News,—and how is Trade,— How does Jock Stot and Lucky Yad, Tam Tup, and Bucky honest Lad? Reply'd the Ass, and made a Heel, E'en a' the better that ye'r weel. But Jackanapes and snarling Fitty Are grown sae wicked, (some ca's't witty) That we wha solid are and grave, Nae Peace on our ain Howms can have; While we are bisy gathering Gear, Upon a Brae they'll sit and sneer. If ane shou'd chance to breathe behin', Or ha'e some Slaver at his Chin, Or 'gainst a Tree shou'd rub his Arse; That's Subject for a winsome Farce: There draw they me, as void of thinking, And you, my Dear, famous for stinking; And the bauld birsy Bair your Frien', A Glutton dirty to the Een, By laughing Dogs and Apes abus'd, Wha is't can thole to be sae us'd! Dear me! heh! wow!—and say ye sae,— Return'd the Brock,—I'm unko wae To see this Flood of Wit break in, O scour about, and ca't a Sin; Stout are your Lungs, your Voice is loud; And ought will pass upon the Crowd. The Ass thought this Advice was right, And bang'd away with a' his Might; Stood on a Know amang the Cattle, And furiously 'gainst Wit did rattle: Pour'd out a Deluge of dull Phrases, While Dogs and Apes leugh, and made Faces. Thus a' the angry Ass held forth, Serv'd only to augment their Mirth. The Fox and Rat. The Lyon and the Tyger lang maintain'd A bloody Weir;—at last the Lyon gain'd. The Royal Victor strak the Earth with Aw, And the four-footed World obey'd his Law: Frae ilka Species Deputies were sent, To pay their Homage due, and compliment Their Sovereign Liege, wha'd gart the Rebels cour, And own his Royal Right, and Princely Power. After Dispute, the moniest Votes agree, That Reynard should address his Majesty, Ulysses like, in Name of a' the Lave; Wha thus went on,—“O Prince, allow thy Slave “To roose thy brave Atchievments and Renown; “Nane but thy daring Front shou'd wear the Crown, “Wha art like Jove, whase Thunderbowt can make “The Heavens be hush, and a' the Earth to shake; “Whase very Gloom, if he but angry nods, “Commands a Peace, and flegs the inferior Gods. “Thus thou, great King, hast by thy conqu'ring Paw, “Gi'en Earth a Shog, and made thy Will a Law: “Thee a' the Animals with Fear adore, “And tremble if thou with Displeasure rore; “O'er a' thou canst us eith thy Sceptre sway, “As Badrans can with cheeping Rottans play.” This Sentence vex'd the Envoy Rottan sair; He threw his Gab, and girn'd; but durst nae mair. The Monarch pleas'd with Lowry, wha durst gloom? A Warrant's order'd for a good round Sum, Which Dragon, Lord Chief Treasurer, must pay To sly-tongu'd Fleechy on a certain Day; Which Secretary Ape in Form wrote down, Sign'd Lyon, and a wee beneath, Baboon. 'Tis given the Fox.—Now Bobtail tap o' Kin, Made rich at anes, is nor to had nor bind; He dreams of nought, but Pleasure, Joy and Peace, Now blest with Wealth, to purchase Hens and Geese. Yet in his Loof he hadna tell'd the Gowd, And yet the Rottan's Breast with Anger glow'd; He vow'd Revenge, and watch'd it Night and Day, He took the Tid, when Lowry was away, And throw a Hole into his Closet slips, There chews the Warrant a' in little Nips. Thus what the Fox had for his Flatt'ry gotten, Ev'n frae a Lyon, was made nought by an offended Rottan. The Caterpillar and the Ant. A pensy Ant, right trig and clean, Came ae Day whiding o'er the Green; Where to advance her Pride, she saw A Caterpillar moving slaw: Good-e'en t'ye, Mistress Ant, said he, How's a' at hame? I'm blyth to s'ye.— The sawcy Ant view'd him with Scorn, Nor wad Civilities return; But gecking up her Head, quoth she, Poor Animal, I pity thee, Wha scarce can claim to be a Creature, But some Experiment of Nature, Whase silly Shape displeas'd her Eye, And thus unfinish'd was flung by. For me, I'm made with better Grace, With active Limbs, and lively Face; And cleverly can move with Ease Frae Place to Place where e'er I please: Can foot a Minuet or Jig, And snoov't like ony Whirly-gig; Which gars my Jo aft grip my Hand Till his Heart pitty-pattys, and— But laigh my Qualities I bring, To stand up clashing with a Thing, A creeping Thing, the like of thee, Not worthy of a Farewell t'ye. The airy Ant syne turn'd awa, And left him with a proud Gaffa. The Caterpillar was struck dumb, And never answer'd her a Mum: The humble Reptile fand some Pain Thus to be banter'd with Disdain. But tent neist time the Ant came by The Worm was grown a Butterfly; Transparent were his Wings and fair, Which bare him flightering throw the Air: Upon a Flower he stapt his Flight, And thinking on his former Slight, Thus to the Ant himsell addrest, Pray, Madam, will ye please to rest, And notice what I now advise, Inferiors ne'er too much despise; For Fortune may gi'e sic a Turn, To raise aboon ye what ye scorn: For instance, now I spread my Wing In Air, while you're a creeping Thing. The twa Cats and the Cheese. Twa Cats anes on a Cheese did light, To which baith had an equal Right; But Disputes, sic as aft arise, Fell out a sharing of the Prize. Fair Paly, said ane, ye bite o'er thick, Thae Teeth of your's gang wonder quick: Let's part it, else lang or the Moon Be chang'd, the Kebuck will be done. But wha's to do't;—they're Parties baith, And ane may do the other Skaith. Sae with Consent away they trudge, And laid the Cheese before a Judge: A Monkey with a campsho Face, Clerk to a Justice of the Peace, A Judge he seem'd in Justice skill'd, When he his Master's Chair fill'd; Now Umpire chosen for Division, Baith sware to stand by his Decision. Demure he looks.—The Cheese he pales,— He prives it good,—Ca's for the Scales; His Knife whops throw't,—in twa it fell; He puts ilk haff in either Shell: Said he, We'll truly weigh the Case, And strictest Justice shall have Place; Then lifting up the Scales, he fand The tane bang up, the other stand: Syne out he took the heaviest haff, And ate a Knoost o't quickly aff, And try'd it syne;—it now prov'd light: Friend Cats, said he, we'll do ye right. Then to the ither haff he fell, And laid till't teughly Tooth and Nail, Till weigh'd again it lightest prov'd. The Judge wha this sweet Process lov'd, Still weigh'd the Case, and still ate on, 'Till Clients baith were weary grown, And tenting how the Matter went, Cry'd, Come, come, Sir, we're baith content. Ye Fools, quoth he, and Justice too, Maun be content as well as you. Thus grumbled they, thus he went on, Till baith the Haves were near hand done: Poor Pousies now the Daffine saw Of gawn for Nignyes to the Law; And bill'd the Judge, that he wad please To give them the remaining Cheese: To which his Worship grave reply'd, The Dues of Court maun first be paid. Now Justice pleas'd:—What's to the fore Will but right scrimply clear your Score: That's our Decreet;—gae hame and sleep, And thank us ye're win aff sae cheap. The Chamaeleon. Twa Travellers, as they were wa'king, 'Bout the Chamaeleon fell a ta'king, (Sic think it shaws them mettl'd Men, To say I've seen, and ought to ken;) Says ane, 'Tis a strange Beast indeed, Four-footed, with a Fish's Head; A little Bowk, with a lang Tail, And moves far slawer than a Snail; Of Colour like a Blawart blue;— Reply'd his Nibour, That's no true; For well I wat his Colour's Green, If ane may true his ain twa Een; For I in Sun-shine saw him fair, When he was dining on the Air.— Excuse me, says the ither Blade, I saw him better in the Shade, And he is Blue.—He's Green I'm sure.— Ye lied.—And ye're the Son of a Whore.— Frae Words there had been Cuff and Kick, Had not a Third come in the Nick, Wha tenting them in this rough Mood, Cry'd, Gentlemen, what! are ye wood? What's ye'r Quarrel, and't may be speer't? Truth, says the tane, Sir, ye shall hear't: The Chamaeleon, I say, he's Blue; He threaps he's Green.—Now, what say you? Ne'er fash ye'r sells about the Matter, Says the sagacious Arbitrator, He's Black.—Sae nane of you are right, I view'd him well with Candle-light; And have it in my Pocket here, Row'd in my Napkin hale and feer. Fy! said ae Cangler, What d'ye mean? I'll lay my Lugs on't, that he's Green. Said th'ither, were I gawn to Death, I'd swear he's Blue with my last Breath. He's Black, the Judge maintain'd ay stout; And to convince them, whop'd him out: But to Surprise of ane and a', The Animal was White as Snaw, And thus reprov'd them, “Shallow Boys, “Away, away, make nae mair Noise; “Ye're a' three wrang, and a' three right, “But learn to own your Nibours Sight “As good as yours.—Your Judgment speak, “But never be sae daftly weak “T'imagine ithers will by Force “Submit their Sentiments to yours; “As things in various Lights ye see, “They'll ilka ane resemble me.” The twa Lizards. Beneath a Tree, ae shining Day, On a Burn-bank twa Lizards lay Beeking themsells now in the Beams, Then drinking of the cauller Streams. Waes me, says ane of them to th'ither, How mean and silly live we, Brither? Beneath the Moon is ought sae poor, Regarded less, or mair obscure! We breathe indeed, and that's just a'; But forc'd by Destiny's hard Law On Earth like Worms to creep and sprawl Curst Fate to ane that has a Saul! Forby, gin we may trow Report, In Nilus Giant Lizards sport, Ca'd Crocodiles:—Ah! had I been Of sic a Size, upon the Green, Then might I had my Skair of Fame, Honour, Respect, and a great Name; And Man with gaping Jaws have shor'd, Syne like a Pa-god been ador'd. Ah Friend! replies the ither Lizard, What makes this grumbling in thy Gizzard? What Cause have ye to be uneasy? Cannot the Sweets of Freedom please ye? We free frae Trouble, Toil or Care, Enjoy the Sun, the Earth and Air, The Crystal Spring, and Green-Wood Shaw, And beildy Holes, when Tempests blaw. Why shou'd we fret, look blae or wan, Tho' we're contemn'd by paughty Man? If sae, let's in Return be wise, And that proud Animal despise. O fy! returns th'ambitious Beast, How weak a Fire now warms thy Breast? It breaks my Heart to live sae mean; I'd like t'attract the Gazer's Een, And be admir'd.—What stately Horns The Deer's majestick Brow adorn! He claims our Wonder and our Dread, Where e'er he heaves his haughty Head. What Envy a' my Spirit fires, When he in clearest Pools admires His various Beauties with Delyte; I'm like to drown my sell with Spite. Thus he held forth,—when straight a Pack Of Hounds, and Hunters at their Back, Ran down a Deer before their Face, Breathless and wearied with the Chace. The Dogs upon the Victim seise, And Bougles sound his Obsequies. But neither Men nor Dogs took tent Of our wee Lizards on the Bent, While hungry Bawty, Buff and Tray, Devour'd the Paunches of the Prey. Soon as the bloody Deed was past, The Lizard wise the Proud addrest, Dear Cousin, now pray let me hear How wad ye like to be a Deer? Ohon! quoth he, convinc'd and wae, Wha wad have thought it anes a Day! Well, be a private Life my Fate, I'll never envy mair the Great: That we are little Fowk, that's true; But sae's our Cares and Dangers too. Mercury in Quest of Peace. The Gods coost out, as Story gaes, Some being Friends, some being Faes, To Men in a besieged City; Thus some frae Spite, and some frae Pity, Stood to their Point with canker'd Strictness, And leftna ither in Dogs Likeness. Juno ca'd Venus Whore and Bawd, Venus ca'd Juno scauldin Jad, E'en cripple Vulcan blew the Low, Apollo ran to bend his Bow, Dis shook his Fork, Pallas her Shield, Neptune his Grape began to wield. What Plague, crys Jupiter, Heh hoy! Maun this Town prove anither Troy? What, will you ever be at odds, Till Mankind think us foolish Gods? Hey! Mistris Peace, make haste,—appear.— But Madam was nae there to hear: Come, Hermes, wing thy Heels and Head, And find her out with a' thy Speed: Trowth this is bonny Wark indeed. Hermes obeys, and staptna short, But flys directly to the Court; For sure, thought he, she will be found, On that fair complimenting Ground, Where Praises and Embraces ran Like current Coin 'tween Man and Man. But soon, alake! he was beguil'd, And fand that Courtiers only smil'd, And with a formal Flat'ry treat ye, That they mair sickerly might cheat ye: Peace was na there, nor e'er could dwell, Where hidden Envy makes a Hell. Niest to the Ha', where Justice stands With Sword and Ballance in her Hands, He flew;—no that he thought to find her Between th'Accuser and Defender; But sure he thought to find the Wench Amang the Fowk that fill the Bench; Sae muckle Gravity and Grace Appear'd in ilka Judge's Face: Even here he was deceiv'd again, For ilka Judge stack to his ain Interpretation of the Law, And vex'd themsells with Had and Draw. Frae thence he flew straight to the Kirk: In this he prov'd as daft a Stirk, To look for Peace, where never three In ev'ry Point cou'd e'er agree; Ane his ain Gate explain'd a Text, Quite contrair to his Neighbour next, And teughly toolied Day and Night, To gar Believers trow them right. Then sair he sigh'd,—where can she be?— Well thought,—the University, Science is ane these maun agree. There did he bend his Strides right clever, But is as far mistane as ever: For here Contention and ill Nature Had runkl'd ilka learned Feature; Ae Party stood for ancient Rules, Anither ca'd the Ancients Fools; Here ane wad set his Shanks aspar, And roose the Man sang Troy War, Anither ca's him Robin Kar. Well, she's no here;—away he flies To seek her amangst Families. Tout, what shou'd she do there I wonder? Dwells she with matrimonial Thunder, Where Mates, some greedy, some deep Drinkers, Contend with thriftless Mates or Jinkers? This says, 'tis Black; and that, wi' Spite, Stifly maintains and threeps 'tis White. Weary'd at last, quoth he, Let's see How Branches with their Stocks agree: But here he fand still his Mistake; Some Parents cruel were, some weak; While Bairns ungratefu' did behave, And wish'd their Parents in the Grave. Has Jove then sent me amang thir Fowk, Cry'd Hermes, here to hunt the Gowk? Well, I have made a waly Round, To seek what is na to be found. Just on the Wing,—towards a Burn A wee Piece aff his Looks did turn; There Mistris Peace he chanc'd to see, Sitting beneath a Willow Tree: And have I found ye at the last? He cry'd aloud, and held her fast. Here I reside, quoth she, and smil'd, With an auld Hermite in this Wild. Well, Madam, said he, I perceive, That ane may lang your Presence crave, And miss ye still;—but this seems plain, To have ye, ane maun be alane. The Spring and the Syke. Fed by a living Spring, a Rill Flow'd easily adown a Hill; A thousand Flowers upon its Bank Flourish'd fu' fair, and grew right rank: Near to its Course a Syke did ly, Whilk was in Simmer aften dry, And ne'er recover'd Life again, But after soaking Showers of Rain: Then wad he swell, look big and sprush, And o'er his Margine proudly gush. Ae Day, after great Waughts of Weet, He with the Chrystal Current met, And ran him down with unco' Din, Said he, How poorly does thou rin? See with what State I dash the Brae, Whilst thou canst hardly make thy Way. The Spring, with a superior Air, Said, Sir, your Brag gives me nae Care; For soon's ye want your foreign Aid, Your paughty Cracks will soon be laid. Frae my ain Head I have Supply; But you must borrow, else rin dry. The Daft Bargain. A Tale. At Market anes, I watna how, Twa Herds between them coft a Cow: Driving her hame, the needfu' Hacky But Ceremony chanc'd to k?. Quoth Rab right ravingly to Raff, Gin ye'll eat that digested Draff Of Crummy, I shall quat my Part.— A Bargain be't, with a' my Heart, Raff soon reply'd, and lick'd his Thumb, To gorble't up without a Gloom: Syne till't he fell, and seem'd right yap His Mealtith quickly up to gawp; Haff done, his Heart began to scunner, But lootna on till Rab strak under; Wha fearing Skair of Cow to tine, At his daft Bargain did repine. Well, well, quoth Raff, tho' ye was rash, I'll scorn to wrang ye, senseless Hash; Come fa' to Wark, as I ha'e done, And eat the ither haff as soon, Ye's save ye'r Part.—Content, quoth Rab.— And slerg'd the rest o't in his Gab: Now what was tint, or what was won, Is eithly seen.—My Story's done.— Yet frae this Tale confed'rate States may learn To save their Cow, and yet no eat her Sharn. The twa Cut-Purses. A Tale. In Borrows-town there was a Fair, And mony a Landart Coof was there Baith Lads and Lasses busked brawly, To glowr at ilka Bonny-waly, And lay out ony ora Bodles On sma' Gimcracks that pleas'd their Nodles; Sic as a Jocktaleg, or Sheers, Confeckit Ginger, Plums or Pears. These gaping Gowks twa Rogues survey, And on their Cash this Plot they lay; The tane, less like a Knave than Fool, Unbidden clam the high Cockstool, And pat his Head and baith his Hands Throw Holes where the Ill-Doer stands. Now a' the Crowd with Mouth and Een Cry'd out, What does the Idiot mean? They glowr'd and leugh, and gather'd thick, And never thought upon a Trick, Till he beneath had done his Job, By tooming Poutches of the Mob; Wha now possest of Rowth of Gear, Scour'd aff as lang's the Cost was clear. But wow? the Ferly quickly chang'd, When throw their empty Fobs they rang'd; Some girn'd, and some look'd blae wi' Grief, While some cry'd out, Fy had the Thief. But ne'er a Thief or Thief was there, Or cou'd be found in a' the Fair. The Jip wha stood aboon them a', His Innocence began to shaw; Said he, my Friends, I'm very sorry To hear your melancholy Story; But sure whate'er your Tinsel be, Ye canna lay the Wyte on me. EPISTLE TO Robert Yarde of Devonshire, Esquire. Frae Northern Mountains clad with Snaw, Where whistling Winds incessant blaw, In time now when the Curling-stane Slides murm'ring o'er the icy Plain, What sprightly Tale in Verse can Yarde Expect frae a cauld Scottish Bard, With Brose and Bannocks poorly fed, In Hoden Gray right hashly cled, Skelping o'er frozen Hags with Pingle, Picking up Peets to beet his Ingle, While Sleet that freezes as it fa's, Theeks as with Glass the Divot Waws Of a laigh Hut, where sax thegither, Ly Heads and Thraws on Craps of Heather? Thus, Sir, of us the Story gaes, By our mair dull and scornfu' Faes: But let them tauk, and Gowks believe, While we laugh at them in our Sleeve; For we, nor barbarous nor rude, Ne'er want good Wine to warm our Blood, Have Tables crown'd,—and hartsome Biels, And can in Cumin's, Don's or Steil's, Be serv'd as plenteously and civil, As you in London at the Devil. You, Sir, your self wha came and saw, Own'd that we wanted nought at a', To make us as content a Nation, As any is in the Creation. This Point premis'd, my canty Muse Cocks up her Crest without Excuse, And scorns to screen her natural Flaws, With If's and But's, and dull Because; She pukes her Pens, and aims a Flight Throu' Regions of internal Light, Frae Fancy's Field, these Truths to bring That you shou'd hear, and she shou'd sing. Langsyne, when Love and Innocence Were humane Nature's best Defence, E'er Party-jars made Lateth less, By cleathing't in a Monkish Dress; Then Poets shaw'd these evenly Roads, That lead to Dwellings of the Gods. In these dear Days, well ken'd to Fame, Divini Vates was their Name: It was, and is, and shall be ay, While they move in fair Vertue's Way. Tho' rarely we to Stipends reach, Yet nane dare hinder us to preach. Believe me, Sir, the nearest Way To Happiness, is to be gay; For Spleen indulg'd will banish Rest Far frae the Bosoms of the best; Thousands a-year's no worth a Prin, When e'er this fashous Guest gets in: But a fair competent Estate Can keep a Man frae looking blate, Sae eithly it lays to his Hand What his just Appetites demand. Wha has, and can enjoy, O wow! How smoothly may his Minutes flow? A Youth thus blest with manly Frame, Enliven'd with a lively Flame, Will ne'er with sordid Pinch controul The Satisfaction of his Soul. Poor is that Mind, ay discontent, That canna use what God has lent; But envious girns at a' he sees, That are a Crown richer than he's; Which gars him pitifully hane, And Hell's Ase-middings rake for Gain; Yet never kens a blythsome Hour, Is ever wanting, ever sowr. Yet ae Extreme shou'd never make A Man the gowden Mien forsake. It shaws as much a shallow Mind, And ane extravagantly blind, If careless of his future Fate, He daftly waste a good Estate, And never thinks till Thoughts are vain, And can afford him nought but Pain. Thus will a Joiner's Shavings bleez, Their Low will for some Seconds please; But soon the glaring Leam is past, And cauldrife Darkness follows fast: While slaw the Fagots large expire, And warn us with a lasting Fire. Then neither, as I ken ye will, With idle Fears your Pleasures spill, Nor with neglecting prudent Care, Do Skaith to your succeeding Heir. Thus steering cannily throw Life, Your Joys shall lasting be and rife: Give a your Passions room to reel, As lang as Reason guides the Wheel. Desires, tho' ardent, are nae Crime, When they harmoniously keep Time: But when they spang o'er Reason's Fence, We smart for't at our ain Expence To recreate us we're allow'd, But gaming deep boils up the Blood, And gars ane at Groomporters ban The Being that made him a Man, When his fair Gardens, House and Lands, Are fa'n amongst the Sharpers Hands. A cheerfu' Bottle sooths the Mind, Gars Carles grow canty, free and kind; Defeats our Care, and hales our Strife, And brawly oyls the Wheels of Life: But when just Quantums we transgress, Our Blessing turns the quite Reverse. To love the bonny smiling Fair, Nane can their Passions better ware; Yet Love is kittle and unruly, And shou'd move tentily and hooly: For if it get o'er meikle Head, 'Tis fair to gallop ane to dead: O'er ilka Hedge it wildly bounds, And grazes on forbidden Grounds; Where constantly, like Furies, range, Poortith, Diseases, Death, Revenge: To toom anes Pouch to Dunty clever, Or have wrang'd Husband prob ane's Liver, Or void ane's Saul out throw a Shanker; In faith 'twad any Mortal canker. Then wale a Virgin worthy you, Worthy your Love and nuptial Vow: Syne frankly range o'er a' her Charms, Drink deep of Joy within her Arms; Be still delighted with her Breast, And on her Love with Rapture feast. May she be blooming, saft and young, With Graces melting from her Tongue; Prudent and yielding to retain Your Love, as well as you her ain. Thus with your Leave, Sir, I've made free To give Advice to ane can gi'e As good again.—But as Mess John Said, when the Sand tald Time was done, “Ha'e Patience, my dear Friends a wee, “And take ae ither Glas frae me; “And if ye think there's Doublets due, “I shanna bauk the like frae you.” THE LAST SPEECH OF A Wretched Miser. O dool! and am I forc'd to die, And nae mair my dear Siller see, That glanc'd sae sweetly in my Eye! It breaks my Heart; My Gowd! my Bands! alackanie! That we shou'd part. For you I labour'd Night and Day, For you I did my Friends betray, For you on stinking Caff I lay, And Blankets thin; And for your Sake fed mony a Flea Upon my Skin. Like Tantalus I lang have stood Chin deep into a Siller Flood; Yet ne'er was able for my Blood, But Pain and Strife, To ware ae Drap on Claiths or Food, To cherish Life. Or like the wissen'd beardless Wights, Wha herd the Wives of Eastern Knights, Yet ne'er enjoy the saft Delights Of Lasses bony; Thus did I watch lang Days and Nights My lovely Money. Altho' my Annualrents cou'd feed Thrice forty Fowk that stood in Need, I grudg'd my sell my daily Bread: And if frae hame, My Pouch produc'd an Ingan Head, To please my Wame. To keep you cosie in a Hoord, This Hunger I with Ease endur'd; And never dought a Doit afford To ane of Skill, Wha for a Dollar might have cur'd Me of this Ill. I never wore my Claiths with brushing, Nor wrung away my Sarks with washing; Nor ever sat in Taverns dashing Away my Coin, To find out Wit or Mirth by clashing O'er dearthfu' Wine. Abiet my Pow was bald and bare, I wore nae frizl'd Limmer's Hair, Which takes of Flower to keep it fair Frae reesting free, As meikle as wad dine and mair The like of me. Nor kept I Servants, Tales to tell, But toom'd my Coodies a' my sell; To hane in Candle I had a Spell Baith cheap and bright, A Fish-head, when it 'gins to smell, Gives curious Light. What Reason can I shaw, quo' ye, To save and starve, to cheat and lie, To live a Beggar, and to die Sae rich in Coin? That's mair than can be gi'en by me, Tho' Belzie join. Some said my Looks were groff and sowr, Fretfu', drumbly, dull and dowr: I own it was na in my Power, My Fears to ding; Wherefore I never cou'd endure To laugh or sing. I ever hated bookish reading, And musical or dancing breeding, And what's in either Face or Cleading, Of painted things; I thought nae Pictures worth the heeding, Except the King's. Now of a' them the Eard e'er bure, I never Rhimers cou'd endure, They're sic a sneering Pack, and poor, I hate to ken 'em; For 'gainst us thrifty Sauls they're sure To spit their Venom. But waster Wives, the warst of a', Without a Youk they gar ane claw, When wickedly they bid us draw Our Siller Spungs, For this and that, to make them braw, And lay their Tongues. Some loo the Courts, some loo the Kirks, Some loo to keep their Skins frae Lirks, Some loo to woo beneath the Birks Their Lemans bony; For me, I took them a' for Stirks That loo'd na Money. They ca'd me Slave to Usury, Squeez, cleave the Hair, and peel the Flee, Clek, flae the Flint, and Penury, And sauless Wretch; But that ne'er skaith'd or troubled me, Gin I grew rich. On Profit a' my Thoughts were bent, And mony Thousands have I lent, But sickerly I took good tent, That double Pawns, With a Cudeigh, and ten per Cint Lay in my Hands. When Borrow'rs brak, the Pawns were Rug, Rings, Beads of Pearl, or Siller Jug, I sald them aff, ne'er fash'd my Lug With Girns or Curses, The mair they whing'd, it gart me hug My swelling Purses. Sometimes I'd sigh, and ape a Saint, And with a lang Rat-rhime of Cant, Wad make a Mane for them in want; But for ought mair, I never was the Fool to grant Them ony Skair. I thought ane freely might pronounce That Chiel a very silly Dunce, That cou'd not Honesty renounce, With Ease and Joys, At ony time, to win an Ounce Of yellow Boys. When young I some Remorse did feel, And liv'd in Terror of the Deel, His Furnace, Whips, and racking Wheel; But by Degrees, My Conscience grown as hard as Steel, Gave me some Ease. But Fears of Want, and carking Care To save my Stock,—and Thirst for mair, By Night and Day opprest me sair, And turn'd my Head; While Friends appear'd like Harpies Gare, That wish'd me dead. For fear of Thieves I aft lay waking The live lang Night till Day was breaking, Syne throu' my Sleep, with Heart sair aking, I've aften started, Thinking I heard my Windows cracking, When Elspa f?. O Gear! I held ye lang thegither; For you I starv'd my good auld Mither, And to Virginia sald my Brither, And crush'd my Wife: But now I'm gawn I kenna whither, To leave my Life. My Life! my God! my Spirit earns, Not on my Kindred, Wife or Bairns, Sic are but very laigh Concerns, Compar'd with thee! When now this mortal Rotle warns Me I maun die. It to my Heart gaes like a Gun, To see my Kin and graceless Son, Like Rooks already are begun To thumb my Gear, And Cash that has not seen the Sun This fifty Year. Oh, oh! that spendthrift Son of mine, Wha can on roasted Moorfowl dine, And like Dub-water skink the Wine, And dance and sing; He'll soon gar my dear Darlings dwine Down to nathing. To that same Place, where e'er I gang, O cou'd I bear my Wealth alang! Nae Heir shou'd e'er a Farthing fang, That thus carouses, Tho' they shou'd a' on Woodies hang, For breaking Houses. Perdition! Sathan! is that you! I sink!—am dizzy!—Candle blue. Wi' that he never mair play'd pew, But with a Rair, Away his wretched Spirit flew, It maksna where. Tit for Tat. Be-south our Channel, where 'tis common To be Priest-ridden, Man and Woman; A Father, anes in grave Procession, Went to receive a Wight's Confession, Whase Sins, lang-gather'd, now began To burden sair his inner Man. But happy they that can with Ease Sling aff sic Laids when e'er they please. Lug out your Sins, and eke your Purses, And soon your kind spiritual Nurses Will ease you of these heavy Turses. Cries Hodge, and sighs, Ah! Father Ghostly, I lang'd anes for some Jewels costly, And staw them frae a sneaking Miser, Wha was a wicked cheating Squeezer, And much had me and others wrang'd, For which I aften wish'd him hang'd. The Father says, I own, my Son, To rob or pilfer is ill done; But I can eith forgive the Faut, Since it is only Tit for Tat. The sighing Penitent gade furder, And own'd his anes designing Murder; That he had lent ane's Guts a Skreed, Wha had gi'en him a broken Head. Replies the Priest, My Son, 'tis plain That's only Tit for Tat again. But still the Sinner sighs and sobs, And cries, Ah! these are venial Jobs To the black Crime that yet behind Lyes like Auld Nick upon my Mind: I dare na name't; I'd lure be strung Up by the Neck, or by the Tongue, As speak it out to you: Believe me, The Faut you never wad forgive me. The haly Man, with pious Care, Intreated, pray'd, and spake him fair, Conjur'd him, as he hop'd for Heaven, To tell his Crime, and be forgiven. Well then, says Hodge, if it maun be, Prepare to hear a Tale frae me, That when 'tis tald, I'm unko feard Ye'll wish it never had been heard. Ah me! your Reverence's Sister, Ten times I carnally have—kist her. All's fair, returns the Reverend Brother, I've done the samen with your Mother Three times as aft; and sae for that We're on a Level, Tit for Tat. EPISTLE From Mr. William Starrat Teacher of Mathematicks at Straban in Ireland. Ae windy Day last Owk, I'll ne'er forget, I think I hear the Hailstanes rattling yet; On Crochan Buss my Hirdsell took the Lee, As ane wad wish, just a' beneath my Ee: I in the Beild of yon auld Birk-tree Side Poor cauldrife Coly whing'd aneath my Plaid, Right tozylie was set to ease my Stumps, Well hap'd with Bountith-hose and twa soll'd Pumps; Syne on my Four-hours Luntion chew'd my Cude, Sic Kilter pat me in a merry Mood: My Whistle frae my Blanket-nook I drew, And lilted owre thir twa three Lines to you. Blaw up my Heart-strings ye Pierian Quines, That ga'e the Grecian Bards their bony Rimes, And learn'd the Latin Lowns sic Springs to play, As gars the Warld gang dancing to this Day. In vain I seek your Help; 'tis bootless Toil With sic dead Ase to muck a Moorland Soil, Give me the Muse that calls past Ages back, And shaws proud Southren Sangsters their Mistake, That frae their Thames can fetch the Laurel North, And big Parnassus on the Frith of Forth. Thy Breast alane this gladsome Guest does fill With Strains, that warm our Hearts like Cannel Gill, And learns thee in thy umquhile Gutcher's Tongue, The blythest Lilts that e'er my Lugs heard sung. RAMSAY! for ever live: For wha like you In deathless Sang sic Life-like Pictures drew? Not he wha whilome with his Harp cou'd ca' The dancing Stanes to big the Theban Wa'; Nor he (shamefa's Fool Head) as Stories tell Could whistle back an auld dead Wife frae Hell; Nor e'en the loyal Brooker of Bell-Trees, Wha sang with hungry Wame his want of Fees; Nor Haby's Dron cou'd with thy Wind-pipe please, When in his well kend Clink thou manes the Death Of Lucky Wood and Spence (a matchless Skaith To Canigate) sae gash thy Gab-trees gang, The Carlines live for ever in thy Sang. Or when the Country Bridal thou pursues, To redd the Regal Tulzie sets thy Muse, Thy soothing Sangs bring canker'd Carles to Ease, Some lowps to Lutter's Pipe, some birls Bawbies. But gin to graver Notes thou tunes thy Breath, And sings poor Sandy's Grief for Edie's Death, Or Matthew's Loss; the Lambs in Consort mae, And lanesome Ringwood youls upon the Brae. Good God! what tuneless Heart-strings wadna twang, When Love and Beauty animates thy Sang? Skies echoe back, when thou blaws up thy Reed, In Burchet's Praise, for clapping of thy Head: And when thou bids the paughty Czar stand yon, The Wandought seems beneath thee on his Throne. Now, be my Saul, and I have nought behin, And weil I wat fause Swearing is a Sin, I'd rather have thy Pipe, and twa three Sheep, Than a' the Gold the Monarchs Coffers keep. COLY, look out, the few we have's gane wrang, This se'nteen Owks I have not play'd sae lang; Ha, Crummy, ha—trowth I maun quat my Sang. But, Lad, neist Mirk we'll to the Haining Drive, When in fresh Lizar they get Spleet and rive; The Royts will rest, and gin ye like my Play, I'll whistle to thee all the live lang Day. To Mr. William Starrat, on receiving the above Epistle. Frae fertile Fields, where nae curs'd Ethers creep, To stang the Herds that in Rash-busses sleep; Frae where Saint Patrick's Blessing freed the Bogs Frae Taids, and Asks, and ugly creeping Frogs; Welcome to me's the Sound of STARRAT's Pipe, Welcome, as Westlen Winds, or Berries ripe, When speeling up the Hill, the Dog-days Heat Gars a young thirsty Shepherd pant and sweat: Thus while I climb the Muses Mount with Care, Sic friendly Praises give refreshing Air. O! may the Lasses loo thee for thy Pains, And may thou lang breathe healsome o'er the Plains: Lang mayst thou teach, with round and nooked Lines, Substantial Skill, that's worth rich Siller Mines; To shaw how Wheels can gang with greatest Ease, And what Kind Barks sails smoothest o'er the Seas; How Wind-mills shou'd be made,—and how they work The Thumper that tells Hours upon the Kirk: How Wedges rive the Aik:—How Pullieses Can lift on highest Roofs the greatest Trees; Rug frae its Roots the Craig of Edinburgh Castle, As easily as I cou'd break my Whistle.— What Pleughs fits a wet Soil, and whilk the dry; And mony a thousand useful Things forby. I own 'tis cauld Encouragement to sing, When round ane's Lugs the blatran Hailstanes ring; But feckfu' Folk can front the bauldest Wind, And slonk thro' Moors, and never fash their Mind. Aft have I wid throu' Glens with chorking Feet, When neither Plaid nor Kelt cou'd fend the Weet; Yet blythly wald I bang out o'er the Brae, And stend o'er Burns as light as ony Rae, Hoping the Morn might prove a better Day. Then let's to Lairds and Ladies leave the Spleen, While we can dance and whistle o'er the Green. Mankind's Account of Good and Ill's a Jest, Fancy's the Rudder, and Content's a Feast. Dear Friend of mine, ye but o'er meikle roose The lawly Mints of my poor moorland Muse, Wha looks but blate, when even'd to either twa, That lull'd the Deel, or bigg'd the Theban Wa'; But trowth 'tis natural for us a' to wink At our ain Fauts, and Praises frankly drink: Fair fa' ye then, and may your Flocks grow rife, And may nae Elf twin Crummy of her Life. The Sun shines sweetly, a' the Lift looks blue, O'er Glens hing hovering Clouds of rising Dew; Maggy, the bonniest Lass of a' our Town, Brent is her Brow, her Hair a curly brown, I have a Tryst with her, and maun away, Then ye'll excuse me till anither Day, When I've mair Time; for shortly I'm to sing Some dainty Sangs, that sall round Crochan ring. Bonny Christy. How sweetly smells the Simmer Green? Sweet taste the Peach and Cherry; Painting and Order please our Een, And Claret makes us merry: But finest Colours, Fruits and Flowers, And Wine, tho' I be thirsty, Lose a' their Charms and weaker Powers, Compar'd with those of Christy. When wand'ring o'er the flowry Park, No nat'ral Beauty wanting; How lightsome is't to hear the Lark, And Birds in Consort chanting? But if my Christy tunes her Voice, I'm rapt in Admiration; My Thoughts with Extasies rejoice, And drap the hale Creation. When e'er she smiles a kindly Glance, I take the happy Omen, And aften mint to make Advance, Hoping she'll prove a Woman. But dubious of my ain Desert, My Sentiments I smother, With secret Sighs I vex my Heart, For fear she love another. Thus sang blate Edie by a Burn, His Christy did o'er-hear him; She doughtna let her Lover mourn, But e'er he wist drew near him. She spake her Favour with a Look, Which left nae Room to doubt her; He wisely this white Minute took, And flang his Arms about her. My Christy!—witness bony Stream, Sic Joys frae Tears arising; I wish this may na be a Dream: O Love the maist surprising Time was too precious now for Tauk, This Point of a' his Wishes; He wadna with set Speeches bauk, But wair'd it a' on Kisses. The bonny Scot To the Tune of, The Boat-man. Ye Gales that gently wave the Sea, And please the canny Boat-man, Bear me frae hence, or bring to me My brave, my bonny Scot—Man. In haly Bands We join'd our Hands; Yet may not this discover, While Parents rate A large Estate, Before a faithfu' Lover. But I loor chuse in Highland Glens To herd the Kid and Goat—Man, E'er I cou'd for sic little Ends Refuse my bonny Scot—Man. Wae worth the Man Wha first began The base ungenerous Fashion, Frae greedy Views, Love's Art to use, While Strangers to its Passion. Frae foreign Fields, my lovely Youth, Haste to thy longing Lassie, Wha pants to press thy bawmy Mouth, And in her Bosom hawse thee. Love gi'es the Word, Then haste on Board, Fair Winds and tenty Boat-man, Waft o'er, waft o'er Frae yonder Shore, My blyth, my bonny Scot—Man. Love Inviting Reason. A Song to the Tune of, I am Asleep, do not waken me. When innocent Pastime our Pleasure did crown, Upon a green Meadow, or under a Tree, E'er Annie became a fine Lady in Town, How lovely, and loving, and bonny was she! Rouze up thy Reason, my beautifu' Annie, Let ne'er a new Whim ding thy Fancy a-jee; O! as thou art bonny, be faithfu' and canny, And favour thy Jamie, wha doats upon thee. Does the Death of a Lintwhite give Annie the Spleen? Can tyning of Trifles be uneasy to thee? Can Lap-dogs and Monkies draw Tears frae these Een, That look with Indifference on poor dying me? Rouze up thy Reason, my beautifu' Annie, And dinna prefer a Paroquet to me; O! as thou art bonny, be prudent and canny, And think on thy Jamie, wha doats upon thee. Ah! shou'd a new Gown, or a Flanders Lace Head, Or yet a wee Coatie, tho' never sae fine, Gar thee grow forgetfu', and let his Heart bleed, That anes had some Hope of purchasing thine? Rouze up thy Reason, my beautifu' Annie, And dinna prefer ye'r Fleegeries to me; O! as thou art bonny, be solid and canny, And tent a true Lover that doats upon thee. Shall a Paris Edition of new fangle Sany, Tho' gilt o'er wi' laces and Fringes he be, By adoring himself, be admir'd by fair Annie, And aim at these Bennisons promis'd to me? Rouze up thy Reason, my beautifu' Annie, And never prefer a light Dancer to me; O! as thou art bonny, be constant and canny, Love only thy Jamie, wha doats upon thee. O! think, my dear Charmer, on ilka sweet Hour, That slade away saftly between thee and me, E'er Squirrels, or Beaus, or Fopery had Power, To rival my Love, and impose upon thee. Rouze up thy Reason, my beautifu' Annie, And let thy Desires be a' center'd in me; O! as thou art bonny, be faithfu' and canny, And love him wha's langing to center in thee. The Bob of Dunblane. Lassie, lend me your braw Hemp Heckle, And I'll lend you my Thripling Kame; For Fainness, Deary, I'll gar ye keckle, If ye'll go dance the Bob of Dunblane. Haste ye, gang to the Ground of ye'r Trunkies, Busk ye braw, and dinna think shame; Consider in Time, if leading of Monkies, Be better than dancing the Bob of Dunblane. Be frank, my Lassie, lest I grow fickle, And take my Word and Offer again; Syne ye may chance to repent it miekle, Ye did na accept of the Bob of Dunblane. The Dinner, the Piper and Priest shall be ready, And I'm grown dowie with lying my lane; Away then leave baith Minny and Dady, And try with me the Bob of Dunblane. Throw the Wood Laddie. O Sandy, why leaves thou thy Nelly to mourn? Thy Presence cou'd ease me, When nathing can please me; Now dowie I sigh on the Bank of the Burn, Or throw the Wood, Laddie, until thou return. Tho' Woods now are bonny, and Mornings are clear, While Lavrocks are singing, And Primroses springing; Yet nane of them pleases my Eye or my Ear, When throw the Wood, Laddie, ye dinna appear. That I am forsaken, some spare no to tell; I'm fash'd wi' their Scorning, Baith Ev'ning and Morning: Their jeering gaes aft to my Heart wi' a Knell, When throw the Wood, Laddie, I wander my sell. Then stay, my dear Sandy, nae langer away, But quick as an Arrow, Haste here to thy Marrow, Wha's living in Langour till that happy Day; When throw the Wood, Laddie, we'll dance, sing and play. Ann thou were my ain Thing. Ann thou were my ain Thing, I would love thee, I would love thee; Ann thou were my ain Thing, How dearly would I love thee. Like Bees that suck the Morning Dew Frae Flowers of sweetest Scent and Hew, Sae wad I dwell upo' thy Mou, And gar the Gods envy me. Ann thou were, &amp;c. Sae lang's I had the Use of Light, I'd on thy Beauties feast my Sight, Syne in saft Whispers through the Night, I'd tell how much I loo'd thee. Ann thou were, &amp;c. How fair and ruddy is my Jean! She moves a Goddess o'er the Green: Were I a King, thou shou'd be Queen, Nane but my sell aboon thee. Ann thou were, &amp;c. I'd grasp thee to this Breast of mine, Whilst thou, like Ivy, or the Vine, Around my stronger Limbs shou'd twine, Form'd hardy to defend thee. Ann thou were, &amp;c. Time's on the Wing, and will not stay, In shining Youth let's make our Hay, Since Love admits of no Delay, O! let na Scorn undo thee. Ann thou were, &amp;c. While Love does at his Altar stand, Hae there's my Heart, gi'e me thy Hand, And with ilk Smile thou shalt command The Will of him wha loves thee. Ann thou were, &amp;c. There's my Thumb I'll ne'er beguile Thee. My sweetest May, let Love incline thee T'accept a Heart which he designs thee, And as your constant Slave regard it, Syne for its Faithfulness reward it; 'Tis Proof a-shot to Birth or Money, But yields to what is sweet and bonny: Receive it then with a Kiss and a Smily, There's my Thumb it will ne'er beguile ye. How tempting sweet these Lips of thine are! Thy Bosom white, and Legs sae fine are, That when in Pools I see thee clean 'em, They carry away my Heart between 'em. I wish, and I wish, while it gaes duntin, O gin I had thee on a Mountain; Tho' Kith and Kin, and a' shou'd revile thee, There's my Thumb I'll ne'er beguile thee. Alane through flow'ry Hows I dander, Tenting my Flocks, lest they shou'd wander; Gin thou'll gae alang, I'll dawt thee gaylie, And gi'e my Thumb I'll ne'er beguile thee. O my dear Lassie, it is but Daffin To had thy Woer up ay niff naffin: That Na, na, na, I hate it most vilely; O say, Yes, and I'll ne'er beguile thee. The Highland Laddie. The Lawland Lads think they are fine, But O they're vain and idly gaudy! How much unlike that gracefu' Mein, And manly Looks of my Highland Laddie? O my bonny, bonny Highland Laddie, My handsome charming Highland Laddie: May Heaven still guard, and Love reward Our Lawland Lass and her Highland Laddie. If I were free at Will to chuse To be the wealthiest Lawland Lady, I'd take young Donald without Trews, With Bonnet blew, and belted Plaidy. O my bonny, &amp;c. The brawest Beau in Borrows-town, In a' his Airs, with Art made ready, Compar'd to him, he's but a Clown; He's finer far in's Tartan Plaidy. O my bonny, &amp;c. O'er benty Hill with him I'll run, And leave my Lawland Kin and Dady; Frae Winter's Cauld and Summer's Sun, He'll screen me with his Highland Plaidy. O my bonny, &amp;c. A painted Room and silken Bed, May please a Lawland Laird and Lady; But I can kiss, and be as glad Behind a Bush in's Highland Plaidy. O my bonny, &amp;c. Few Compliments between us pass, I ca' him my dear Highland Laddie; And he ca's me his Lawland Lass: Syne rows me in his Highland Plaidy. O my bonny, &amp;c. Nae greater Joy I'll e'er pretend, Than that his Love prove true and steady, Like mine to him; which ne'er shall end, While Heaven preserve my Highland Laddie. O my bonny, &amp;c. The Coalier's bonny Lassie. The Coalier has a Daughter, And O she's wonder bonny; A Laird he was that sought her, Rich baith in Lands and Money. The Tutors watch'd the Motion Of this young honest Lover: But Love is like the Ocean; Wha can its Depth discover? He had the Art to please ye, And was by a' respected; His Airs sat round him easy, Genteel, but unaffected. The Coalier's bonny Lassie Fair as the new blown Lilly, Ay sweet, and never saucy, Secur'd the Heart of Willy. He lov'd beyond Expression The Charms that were about her, And panted for Possession; His Life was dull without her. After mature resolving, Close to his Breast he held her, In saftest Flames dissolving, He tenderly thus tell'd her; My bonny Coalier's Daughter, Let nathing discompose ye, 'Tis not your scanty Tocher Shall ever make me lose ye; For I have Gear in Plenty, And Love says, 'tis my Duty To ware what Heaven has lent me Upon your Wit and Beauty. To L. L. in Mourning. To the Tune of, Where Helen lyes. Ah! why those Tears in Nelly's Eyes? To hear thy tender Sighs and Cries, The Gods stand list'ning from the Skies, Pleas'd with thy Piety. To mourn the Dead, dear Nymph, forbear, And of one dying take a Care, Who views thee as an Angel fair, Or some Divinity. O be less graceful or more kind, And cool this Fever of my Mind, Caused by the Boy severe and blind, Wounded I sigh for thee; While hardly dare I hope to rise To such a Height, by Hymen's Tyes, To lay me down where Helen lyes, And with thy Charms be free. Then must I hide my Love and die, When such a sovereign Cure is by? No, she can love, and I'll go try, Whate'er my Fate may be. Which soon I'll read in her bright Eyes; With those dear Agents I'll advise, They tell the Truth, when Tongues tell Lies, The least believ'd by me. AN ODE, With a Pastoral Recitative on the Marriage of the Right Honourable, James Earl of Wemyss and Mrs. Janet Charteris. RECITATIVE. Last Morn young Rosalind, with laughing Een, Met with the singing Shepherd on the Green; Armyas height, wha us'd with tunefu' Lay To please the Ear, when he began to play: Him with a Smile the blooming Lass addrest; Her chearfu' Look her inward Joy confest. ROSALIND. Dear Shepherd, now exert your wonted Fire, I'll tell you News that shall your Thoughts inspire. ARMYAS. Out wi' them, bonny Lass, and if they'll bear, But Ceremony you a Sang shall hear. ROSALIND. They'll bear, and do invite the blythest Strains, The beauteous CHARTERISSA of these Plains, Still to them dear, wha late made us sae wae, When we heard tell she was far aff to gae, And leave our heartsome Fields, her native Land, Now's ta'en in time, and fixt by Hymen's Band. ARMYAS. To whom? Speak fast;—I hope ye dinna jeer. ROSALIND. No, no, my Dear, 'tis true, as we stand here. The Thane of Fife, wha lately wi' his Flane, And Vizy leel, made the Blyth Bowl his ain: He, the Delight of baith the Sma' and Great, Wha's bright Beginning spae his sonsy Fate, Has gain'd her Heart; and now their mutual Flame Retains the Fair, and a' her Wealth, at Hame. ARMYAS. Now Rosalind, may never Sorrow twine Sae near your Heart, as Joys arise in mine. Come kiss me, Lassie, and you's hear me sing A Bridal Sang that thro' the Woods shall ring. ROSALIND. Ye'r ay sae daft, come take it, and hae done; Let a' the Lines be saft, and sweet the Tune. Armyas Sings. Come, Shepherds, a' your Whistles join, And shaw your blythest Faces; The Nymph that we were like to tine, At hame her Pleasure places. Lilt up your Notes baith loud and gay, Yet sweet as Philomella's, And yearly solemnize the Day When this good Luck befell us, Hail to the Thane descended frae MACDUFF renown'd in Story, Wha Albion, frae tyrannick Sway, Restor'd to ancient Glory: His early Blossoms loud proclaim, That frae this Stem he rises, Whase Merit gives him Right to Fame, And to the highest Prizes. His lovely Countess sing, ye Swains, Nae Subject can be sweeter; The best of Blood flows in her Veins, Which makes ilk Grace compleater: Bright are the Beauties of her Mind, Which frae her Dawn of Reason, With a' the Rays of Wit hath shin'd, Which Vertue still did season. Straight as the Plane her Features fair, And bonny to a Wonder; Were Jove rampaging in the Air, Her Smiles might stap his Thunder. Rejoice in her then, Happy Youth; Her innate Worth's a Treasure; Her Sweetness a' your Cares will sooth, And furnish endless Pleasure. Lang may ye live t'enjoy her Charms, And lang lang may they blossom, Securely screen'd within your Arms, And lodged in your Bosom. Thrice happy Parents, justly may Your Breasts with Joy be fired, When you the darling Pair survey, By a' the Warld admired. On seeing the ARCHERS diverting themselves at the Buts and Rovers, &amp;c. At the Desire of Sir William Bennet. Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo. Apollo aft flings by his Bows, And plays the Broom of Cowden-knows; He sometimes drinks, ? His Demand. “The Rovers and the Buts you saw, “And him who gives Despotick Law; “In Numbers sing what you have seen “Both in the Garden and the Green, “And how with Wine they clos'd the Day “In harmless Toasts, both blyth and gay: “This to remember be 't thy Care, “How they did Justice to the Fair.” Th Answer. Sir, I with much Delight beheld The Royal Archers on the Field; Their Garb, their Manner and their Game, Wakes in the Mind a martial Flame. To see them draw the bended Yew, Brings bygane Ages to our View, When burnish'd Swords and whizzing Flanes Forbade the Norwegens and Danes, Romans and Saxons, to invade A Nation of nae Faes afraid; Whose Virtue and true Valour sav'd Them bravely from their being enslav'd: esteeming 't greater not to be, Than lose their darling Liberty. How much unlike!—But mum for that, Some Beaus may snarl if we should prat. When Av'rice, Luxury and Ease, A Tea-fac'd Generation please, Whase pithless Limbs in Silks o'erclad, Scarce bear the Lady-handed Lad Frae's Looking-glass into the Chair, Which bears him to blaflum the Fair, Wha by their Actions come to ken Sic are but in appearance Men. These ill cou'd bruik, without a Beild, To sleep in Boots upon the Field; Yet rise as glorious as the Sun, To end what greatly they begun. Nor cou'd it suit their Taste and Pride To eat an Ox boild in his Hide; Or quaff pure Element, ah me! Without Ream, Sugar and Bohee. Hail noble Ghosts of each brave Sire! Whose Sauls glow'd with a God-like Fire! If you're to Guardian Posts assign'd, And can with Greatness warm the Mind: Breathe manly Ardours in your Race, Communicate that martial Grace, By which through Ages you maintain'd The Caledonian Rights unstain'd; That when our Nation makes Demands, She may ne'er want brave Hearts and Hands. Here, Sir, I must your Pardon ask, If I have started from my Task; For when the Fancy takes a Flight, We seldom ken where it will light. But we return to view the Band, Under the regular Command Of Mr. David Drummond President of the Council. ane wha arbitrarly sways, And makes it Law whate'er he says: Him Honour and true Reason rule, Which makes Submission to his Will Nae Slav'ry, but a just Delight, While he takes care to keep them right; Wha never lets a Cause depend Till the Pursuer's Power's at End; But, like a Minister of Fate, He speaks, and there's no more Debate: Best Government, were Subjects sure To find a Prince fit for sic Pow'r. But drop we Cases not desir'd, To paint the Archers, now retir'd From healthfu' Sport, to chearfu' Wine, Strength to recruit, and Wit refine; Where innocent and blythsome Tale Permits nae Sourness to prevail: Here, Sir, you never fail to please, Wha can in Phrase adapt with Ease, Draw to the Life a' Kind of Fowks, Proud Shaups, dull Coofs, and gabbling Gowks, Gielaingers, and each greedy Wight, You place them in their proper Light; And when true Merit comes in view, You fully pay them what's their due. While circling wheels the hearty Glass, Well flavour'd with some lovely Lass, Or with the bonny fruitfu' Dame, Wha brightens in the nuptial Flame. My Lord, your Toast, the Præses crys: To Lady Charlotte, he replys. Now, Sir, let's hear your Beauty bright: To Lady Jean, returns the Knight. To Hamilton a Health gaes round, And one to Eglinton is crown'd. How sweet they taste!—Now, Sir, you say: Then drink to her that's far away, The lov'd Southesk. Neist, Sir, you name: I give you Basil's handsome Dame. Is't come to me?—then toast the Fair That's fawn, O Cockburn, to thy Skair. How hearty went these Healths about! How blythly were they waughted out! To a' the Stately, Fair and Young, Frae Haddington and Hoptoun sprung, To Lithgow's Daughter in her Bloom, To dear Mackay, and comely Home, To Creightons every way divine, To Haldane straight as any Pine. O how delicious was the Glass Which was perfum'd with lovely Bess! And sae these Rounds were flowing gi'en, To Sisters Nisbet, Nell and Jean. To sweet Montgomery shining fair, To Priestfield Twins, delightfu' Pair. To Katies Four of beauteous Fame, Stuart and Cochran Lady claim, Third Hamilton, Fourth Ardress Name. To Peggies Pentland, Bang and Bell, To Minto's Mate, and lively Nell: To Gordons ravishingly sweet, To Maule in whom the Graces meet, To Hepburn wha has Charms in store, To Pringle Harmony all o'er, To the polite Kinloch and Hay, To Wallace beautifu' and gay, To Campbell, Skeen and Rutherfoord, To Maitland fair the much ador'd, To Lockhart with the sparkling Een, To bonny Crawford ever green, To Stuarts mony a dazling Bairn, Of Invernytie and Denairn. To gracefu' Sleigh, and Oliphant, To Nasmith, Baird, Scot, Grier and Grant, To Clerk, Anstruther, Frank and Graham, To Deans agreeing with her Name. Where are we now—. Come, to the best In Christendom, and a' the rest. (Dear Nymphs unnam'd, lay not the Blame On us, or on your want of Fame, That in this List you do not stand; For Heads gave way:—But there's my Hand, The neist time we have sic a Night, We'll not neglect to do ye Right.) Thus Beauties rare, and Virgins fine, With blooming Belles enliven'd our Wine, Till a' our Noses 'gan to shine. Then down we look'd upon the Great, Who're plagu'd with guiding of the State, And pity'd each flegmatick Wight, Whose creeping Sauls ken nae Delight, But keep themsells ay on the Gloom, Startled with Fears of what's to come. Poor Passion! sure by Fate design'd The Mark of an inferior Mind. To Heaven a filial Fear we awe, But Fears nane else a Man shou'd shaw. Lads, cock your Bonnets, bend your Bows, And, or in earnest, or in mows, Be still successful, ever glad, In Mars's or in Venus' Bed; Sae Bards aloud shall chant your Praise, And Ladies shall your Spirits raise. Thus, Sir, I've sung what you requir'd, As Mars and Venus have inspir'd. While they inspire, and you approve, I'll sing brave Deeds, and safter Love; Till great Apollo say well done, And own me for his native Son. Wrote on Lady Somervile's Book of Scots Sangs. Gae, canty Book, and win a Name; Nae Lyricks e'er shall ding thee: Hope large Esteem, and lasting Fame, If SOMERVILLA sing thee. If she thy sinless Faults forgive, Which her sweet Voice can cover, Thou shalt in spite of Criticks live Still grateful to each Lover. THE NUPTIALS, A MASQUE An unknown ingenious Friend did me the Honour of the following Introduction to the London Edition of this Masque; and being a Poet, my Vanity will be pardoned for incerting of it here. “The present Poem being a Revival of a good old Form of Poetry in high Repute with us, it may not be amiss to say something of a Diversion once so agreeable, and so long interrupted, or disused. The Original of Masques seems to be an Imitation of the Interludes of the Ancients, presented on Occasion of some Ceremony performed in a great and noble Family. The Actors in this Kind of Half-Dramatic Poetry have formerly been even Kings, Princes, and the first Personages of the Kingdom; and in private Families, the noblest and nearest Branches. The Machinery was of the greatest Magnificence; very shewy, costly, and not uncommonly contrived by the ablest Architects, as well as the best Poets. Thus we see in Ben. Johnson the Name of Inigo Jones, and the same in Carew; whether as the Modeller only, or as Poet in Conjunction with them, seems to be doubtful, there being nothing of our English Vitruvius left (that I know of) that places him in the Class of Writers. These Shews we trace backwards as far as Henry VIII, from thence to Q. Elizabeth, and her Successor K. James, who was both a great Encourager and Admirer of them. The last Masque, and the best ever written, was that of Milton, presented at Ludlow Castle, in the Praise of which no Words can be too many: And I remember to have heard the late excellent Mr Addison agree with me in that Opinion. Coronations, Princely Nuptials, Public Feasts, the Entertainment of foreign Quality, were the usual Occasions of this Performance, and the best Poet of the Age was courted to be the Author. Mr. Ramsay has made a noble and successful Attempt to revive this kind of Poesy, on a late celebrated Account, And tho' he is often to be admired in all his Writings, yet, I think, never more than in his present Composition. A particular Friend gave it a Second Edition in England, which, I fancy, the Public will agree that it deserved.” on the Marriage of his Grace James Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, &amp;c. Calliope, playing upon a Violencello, sings, Joy to the Bridegroom, Prince of Clyde, Lang may his Bliss and Greatness blossom; Joy to his virtuous charming Bride, Who gains this Day his Grace's Bosom. Appear, great Genius of his Line, And bear a Part in the Rejoicing; Behold your Ward, by Powers Divine, Join'd with a Mate of their ain choosing. Forsake a while the Cyprian Scene, Fair Queen of Smiles and saft Embraces, And hither come, with a' your Train Of Beauties, Loves, and Sports, and Graces. Come, Hymen, bless their Nuptial Vow, And them with mutual Joys inspire. Descend, Minerva, for 'tis you With Virtue beets the haly Fire. At the Close of this Song, enters the Genius of the Family, clad in a Scarlet Robe, with a Duke's Coronet on his Head, a Shield on his left Arm, with the proper Bearing of Hamilton. GENIUS. Fair Mistris of harmonious Sounds, we hear Thy Invitation gratefu' to the Ear; Of a' the Gods, who from the Olympian Height Bow down their Heads, and in thy Notes delight, Jove keeps this Day in his Imperial Dome, And I to lead th'invited Guests am come. Enter Venus, attended by three Graces, with Minerva and Hymen, all in their proper Dresses. CALLIOPE. Welcome, ye bright Divinities, that guard The Brave and Fair, and faithfu' Love reward; All hail, immortal Progeny of Jove, Who plant, preserve and prosper sacred Love. GENIUS. Be still auspicious to th'united Pair, And let their purest Pleasures be your Care; Your Stores of genial Blessings here employ, To crown th'Illustrious Youth and Fair-ane's Joy. VENUS. I'll breathe eternal Sweets in ev'ry Air; HE shall look always Great, SHE ever Fair; Kind Rays shall mix the Sparkles of his Eye, Round her the Loves in smiling Crowds shall fly, And bear frae ilka Glance, on douny Wings, Into his ravish'd Heart the saftest Things: And soon as Hymen has perform'd his Rites, I'll show'r on them my hale Idalian Sweets They shall possess, In each Caress, Delights shall tire The Muses Sire, In highest Numbers to express. HYMEN. I'll busk their Bow'r, and lay them gently down, Syne ilka langing Wish with Raptures crown; The gloomy Nights shall ne'er unwelcome prove, That leads them to the silent Scenes of Love. The Sun at Morn shall dart his kindest Rays, To chear and animate each dear Embrace: Fond of the Fair, he falds her in his Arms; She blushes secret, conscious of her Charms. Rejoice, brave Youth, In sic a Fouth Of Joys the Gods for thee provide; The rosy Dawn, The flow'ry Lawn, That Spring has dress'd in a' its Pride, Claim nae Regard When they're compar'd With blooming Beauties of thy Bride. MINERVA. Fairest of a' the Goddesses, and thou That links the Lovers to be ever true, The Gods and Mortals awn your mighty Power, But 'tis not you can make their Sweets secure: That be my Task, to make a Friendship rise, Shall raise their Loves aboon the vulgar Size. Those near related to the brutal Kind, Ken nathing of the Wedlock of the Mind; 'Tis I can make a Life a hinny Moon, And mould a Love shall last like that aboon. A' these sma' Springs, whence cauld Reserve and Spleen Take their first Rise, and favour'd flow mair keen, I shall discover in a proper View, To keep their Joys unmix'd, and ever new. Nor Jealousy, nor envious Mouth, Shall dare to blast their Love; But Wisdom, Constancy and Truth, Shall ev'ry Bliss improve. GENIUS. Thrice happy Chief, sae much the Care Of a' the Family of Jove, A thousand Blessings wait the Fair, Who is found worthy of his Love. Lang may the fair Attractions of her Mind Make Her still lovelier, Him for ever kind. MINERVA. The Ancestors of mightiest Chiefs and Kings, Nae higher can derive than humane Springs; Yet frae the common Soil each wondrous Root, Aloft to Heaven their spreading Branches shoot: Bauld in my Aid, these triumph'd over Fate, Fam'd for unbounded Thought or stern Debate, Born high upon an undertaking Mind, Superior raise, and left the Crowd behind. GENIUS. Frae these descending, laurel'd with Renown, My Charge throw Ages draws his Lineage down. The Paths of sic Forbeers lang may He trace, And She be Mother to as fam'd a Race. When blew Diseases fill the drumly Air, And red het Bowts throw Flaughts of Lightning rair, Or madning Faction shakes the sanguine Sword, With watchfu' Eye I'll tent my darling Lord, And his lov'd Mate,—tho' Furies shou'd break loose, Awake or sleeping, shall enjoy Repose. I. GRACE. While Gods keep Haly-day, and Mortals smile, Let Nature with Delights adorn the Isle: Be hush, bauld North, Favonius only blaw, And cease, bleak Clouds, to shed or Weet or Snaw; Shine bright, thou radiant Ruler of the Year, And gar the Spring with earlier Pride appear. II. GRACE. Thy Month, great Queen of Goddesses, make gay, Which gains new Honours frae this Marriage Day. On Glotta's Banks, ye healthfu' Hynds, resort, And with the Landart Lasses blythly sport. III. GRACE. Wear your best Faces and your Sunday's Weeds, And rouse the Dance with your maist tunefu' Reeds; Let tunefu' Voices join the rural Sound, And wake responsive Echo all around. I. GRACE. Sing your great Master, Scotia's eldest Son, And the lov'd Angel that his Heart has won; Come, Sisters, let's frae Arts hale Stores collect Whatever can her native Beauties deck, That in the Day she may eclipse the Light, And ding the Constellations of the Night. VENUS. Cease, busy Maids, your artfu' Buskings raise, But small Addition to her genuine Rays; Tho' ilka Plain and ilka Sea combine To make her with their richest Product shine, Her lip, her Bosom, and her sparkling Een, Excel the Ruby, Pearl, and Diamond sheen: These lesser Ornaments, illustrious Bride, As Bars to safter Blessings, fling aside, Steal frae them sweetly to your Nuptial Bed, As frae its Body slides the sainted Shade; Frae loath'd Restraint to Liberty above, Where all is Harmony, and all is Love: Haste to these Blessings,—kiss the Night away, And make it ten times pleasanter than Day. HYMEN. The Whisper and Caress shall shorten Hours, While kindly as the Beams on dewy Flowers; Thy Sun, like him who the fresh Bevrage sips, Shall feast upon the Sweetness of thy Lips: My haly Hand maun chastly now unloose That Zone which a' thy Virgin Charms enclose: That Zone shou'd be less gratefu' to the Fair Than easy Bands of safter Wedlock are. That lang unbuckled grows a hatefu' thing, The langer These are bound, they mair of Honour bring. MINERVA. Yes, happy Pair, what e'er the Gods inspire, Pursue, and gratify each just Desire: Enjoy your Passions, with full Transports mixt; But still observe the Bounds by Vertue fixt. Enter BACCHUS. What brings Minerva here this rantin Night? She's good for nathing but to preach or fight: Is this a Time for either!—Swith away, Or learn like us to be a thought mair gay. MINERVA. Peace, Theban Roarer, while the milder Powers Give Entertainment, there's nae need of yours; The pure Reflection of our calmer Joys Has mair of Heaven than a' thy flashy Noise. BACCHUS. Ye canna want it, Faith! You that appear Anes at a Bridal but in twenty Year: A Ferly 'tis your Dortiship to see; But where was e'er a Wedding without me? Blew Een, remember, I'm baith Hap and Saul To Venus there, but me she'd starve o' Caul. VENUS. We awn the Truth,—Minerva, cease to check Our jolly Brother with your Disrespect; He's never absent at the Treats of Jove, And shou'd be present at this Feast of Love. GENIUS. Maist welcome Power, that chears the vital Streams, When Pallas guards thee frae thy wild Extremes; Thy rosy Visage at these solemn Rites, My generous Charge with open Smiling greets. BACCHUS. I'm nae great Dab at Speeches that maun clink, But there's my Paw I shall fou tightly drink A hearty Health to thir same lovely Twa, That are sae meikle dauted by you a'; Then with my Juice a reeming Bicquor crown, I'll gie the Toast, and see it fairly round. Enter Ganymed, with a Flagon in one Hand, and a Glass in the other,—speaks. [GANYMED.] To you, blyth Beings, the benign Director Of Gods and Men,—to keep your Sauls in tift,— Has sent you here a Present of his Nectar, As good as e'er was browen aboon the Lift. BACCHUS. Ha, Gany! Come, my dainty Boy, Skink 't up, and let us prive; Without it Life wad be a Toy: Here, gi'e me't in my Nive. (Takes the Glass) Good Health to Hamilton, and his Lov'd Mate:—O Father Jove, we crave Thou'lt grant them a lang Tack of Bliss, And Rowth of bonny Bairns and brave. Pour on them, frae thy endless Store, A' Bennisons that are divine, With as good Will as I waught o'er This flowing Glass of heav'nly Wine. (Drinks, and causes all the Company to drink round.) Come, see 't about, and syne let's all advance, Mortals and Gods be Pairs, and tak a Dance; Minerva mim, for a' your Morals stoor, Ye shall with Billy Bacchus fit the Floor: Play up there, Lassie, some blyth Scottish Tune, Syne a' be blyth, when Wine and Wit gae round. The Health about, Musick and Dancing begin.—The Dancing over before her Grace retires with the Ladies to be undress'd; Calliope sings the EPITHALAMIUM. Bright is the Low of Lawfu' Love, Which shining Sauls impart; It to Perfection mounts above, And glows about the Heart. It is the Flame gives lasting Worth, To Greatness, Beauty, Wealth, and Birth,— On You, illustrious youthfu' Pair, Who are high Heavens Delight and Care; The blessfu' Beam darts warm and fair, And shall improve the rest Of a' these Gifts baith great and rare, Of which ye are possest. BACCHUS, bear off your dinsome Gang, Hark, frae yon Howms the rural Thrang Invite you now away; While ilka Hynd, And Maiden kind, Dance in a Ring, While Shepherds sing In Honour of the Day; Gae drink and dance Till Morn advance, And set the twinkling Fires, While we prepare To lead the Fair And Brave to their Desires. Gae, Loves and Graces, take your Place, Around the Nuptial Bed abide; Fair Venus heighten each Embrace, And smoothly make their Minutes slide. Gae, Hymen, put the Couch in Case, Minerva thither lead the Bride; Neist, all attend his youthfu' Grace, And lay him sweetly by her Side. ODE On the Marriage of the Right Honourable George Lord Ramsay and Lady Jean Maule. Hail to the brave apparent Chief, Boast of the RAMSAYS Clanish Name, Whose Ancestors stood the Relief Of SCOTLAND, Ages known to Fame. Hail to the lovely She, whose Charms, Complete in Graces, meets His Love; Adorn'd with all that Greatness warms, And makes Him grateful bow to Jove. Both from a Line of Patriots rise, Chiefs of DALHOUSIE and PANMURE, Whose loyal Fames shall Stains despise, While Ocean flows and Orbs endure. The RAMSAYS! Caledonia's Prop; The MAULES! struck still her Foes with Dread: Now joyn'd; we, from the Union, hope A Race of Heroes shall succeed. Let meaner Souls transgress the Rules That's fix'd by Honour, Love and Truth, While little Views proclaim them Fools, Unworthy Beauty, Sense and Youth. Whil'st You, blest Pair, belov'd by all The Powers above, and Best below, Shall have Delights attend Your Call, And lasting Pleasures on You flow. What Fate has fix'd, and Love has done, The Guardians of Mankind approve: Well may they finish what's begun, And from Your Joys all Cares remove. We wish'd,—When straight a heavenly Voice Inspir'd,—we heard the Blew-ey'd Maid Cry, Who dare quarrel with the Choice? The Choice is mine, be mine their Aid. Be thine their Aid, O wisest Power, And soon again we hope to see Their Plains return, splendid their Tower, And blossom broad the See Note, Vol. I., p. 177. Edge-well-Tree. Whilst He with manly Merits stor'd, Shall rise the Glory of His Clan; She for Celestial Sweets ador'd, Shall ever charm the gracefu' Man. Soon may their The Spread Eagle Sable, on a Field Argent, is the Arms of the Earl of Dalhousie. Royal Bird extend His sable Plumes, and Lordships claim, Which to His valiant Sires pertain'd, E'er Earls in Albion were a Name. Ye Parents of the happy Pair, With gen'rous Smiles consenting, own That they deserve Your kindest Care: Thus with the Gods their Pleasure crown. Haste, ev'ry Grace, each Love and Smile, From fragrant Cyprus spread the Wing; To deck their Couch, exhaust your Isle Of all the Beauties of the Spring. On them attend with Homage due. In Him are Mars and Phœbus seen; And in the Noble Nymph you'll view The sage Minerva, and your Queen. ODE On the Birth of the Most Honourable Marquis of Dumlanrig. Help me, some God, with sic a Muse As Pope and Granvile aft employ, That I may flowing Numbers chuse, To hail the welcome Princely Boy. But, bred up far frae shining Courts, In Moorland Glens, where nought I see, But now and then some Landart Lass, What Sounds polite can flow frae me? Yet my blyth Lass, amang the lave, With honest Heart her Homage pays; Tho' no sae nice she can behave, Yet always as she thinks she says. Arise, ye Nymphs, on Nytha's Plains, And gar the Craigs and Mountains ring; Rouse up the Sauls of a' the Swains, While you the lovely Infant sing. Keep Haly-day on ilka Howm, With Gowan Garlands gird your Brows; Out o'er the Dales in Dances roam, And shout around the jovial News. By the good Bennison of Heaven, To free you frae the future Fright Of foreign Lords, a Babe is given, To guard your Int'rest and your Right. With Pleasure view your Prince, who late Up to the state of Manhood run, Now, to complete his happy Fate, Sees his ain Image in a Son. A Son, for whom be this your Pray'r, Ilk Morning soon as Dawn appears, GOD grant him an unmeasur'd Skair Of a' that grac'd his great Forbeers: That his Great Sire may live to see, Frae his delightfu' Infant spring, A wise and stalwart Progeny, To fence their Country and their King. Still bless her Grace frae whom he sprung, With blythsome Heal her Strength renew, That throw lang Life she may be young, And bring forth Cautioners enow. Watch well, ye Tenants of the Air, Wha hover round our Heads unseen; Let dear DUMLANRIG be your Care, Or when he lifts or steeks his Een. Ye hardy Heroes, whase brave Pains Defeated ay th'invading Rout, Forsake a wee th'Elisian Plains, View, smile and bless your lovely Sprout. Ye Fair, wha've kend the Joys of Love, And glow with chearfu' Heal and Youth, Sic as of auld might nurse a Jove, Or lay the Breast t'Alcide's Mouth; The best and bonniest of ye a' Take the sweet Babie in your Arms; May he nought frae your Bosoms draw, But Nectar to nurse up his Charms. Harmoniously the Notes express, When singing you his Dumps debar, That Discord never may impress Upon his blooming Mind a Jar. Sound a' the Poet in his Ears, E'en while he's hanging at the Breast: Thus moulded, when he comes to Years, With an exalted Gust he'll feast On Lays immortal, which forbid The Death of DOUGLAS' doughty Name, Or in Oblivion let ly hid The HYDES their Beauty and their Fame. EPISTLE To Mr. JOHN GAY, Author of the Shepherd's Week, on hearing her Grace Dutchess of Queensberry commend some of his Poems. Dear Lad, wha linkan o'er the Lee, Sang Blowzalind and Bowzybee, And, like the Lavrock, merrily Wak'd up the Morn, When thou didst tune, with heartsome Glee, Thy Bog-reed-horn. To thee, frae Edge of Pentland Height, Where Fawns and Fairies take Delight, And revel a' the live lang Night, O'er Glens and Braes, A Bard that has the second Sight Thy Fortune spaes. Now, lend thy Lug, and tent me, GAY, Thy Fate appears like Flow'rs in May, Fresh flowrishing, and lasting ay, Firm as the Aik, Which envious Winds, when Criticks bray, Shall never shake. Come, shaw your Loof.—Ay, there's the Line Fortells thy Verse shall ever shine, Dawted whilst living by the Nine, And a' the Best, And be, when past the mortal Line, Of Fame possest. Immortal Pope, and skilfu' Dr. Arbuthnot. John, The learned Leach frae Callidon, With mony a witty Dame and Don, O'er lang to name, Are of your Roundels very fon, And sound your Fame. And sae do I, wha roose but few, Which nae sma' Favour is to you: For to my Friends I stand right true, With Shanks a spar; And my good Word (ne'er gi'en but due) Gangs unko far. Here mettled Men my Muse mantain, And ilka Beauty is my Friend; Which keeps me canty, brisk and bein, Ilk wheeling Hour, And a sworn Fae to hatefu' Spleen, And a' that's sour. But bide ye Boy, the main's to say, Clarinda bright as rising Day, Divinely Bonny, Great and Gay, Of thinking even, Whase Words and Looks, and Smiles display Full Views of Heaven. To rumage Nature for what's braw, Like Lillies, Roses, Gems and Snaw; Compar'd with her's, their Lustre fa', And bauchly tell Her Beauties: She excels them a', And's like her sell. As fair a Form as e'er was blest, To have an Angel for a Guest; Happy the Prince who is possest Of sic a Prize, Whose Vertues place her with the best Beneath the Skies. O sonsy GAY! this heavenly born, Whom ev'ry Grace strives to adorn, Looks not upon thy Lays with Scorn; Then bend thy Knees, And bless the Day that ye was born With Arts to please. She says, Thy Sonnet smoothly sings, Sae ye may craw and clap your Wings, And smile at Ether-capite Stings With careless Pride, When sae much Wit and Beauty brings Strength to your Side. Lilt up your Pipes, and rise aboon Your Trivia and your Moorland Tune, And sing Clarinda late and soon, In touring Strains, Till gratefu' Gods cry out, Well done, And praise thy Pains. Exalt thy Voice, that all around, May echo back the lovely Sound, Frae Dover Cliffs, with Samphire crown'd, To Thule's Shore, Where Northward no more Britain's found But seas that rore. Thus sing,—whil'st I frae Arthur's Height, O'er Chiviot glowr with tyr'd Sight, And langing wish, like raving Wight, To be set down, Frae Coach and sax, baith trim and tight, In London Town. But lang I'll gove and bleer my Ee, Before, alake! that Sight I see; Then, best Relief, I'll strive to be Quiet and content, And streek my Limbs down easylie Upon the Bent. There sing the Gowans, Broom and Trees, The Crystal Burn and Westlin Breez, The bleeting Flocks, and bisy Bees, And blythsome Swains, Wha rant and dance, with kiltit Dees, O'er Mossy Plains. Farewell;—but, e'er we part, let's pray, GOD save Clarinda Night and Day, And grant her a' she'd wish to ha'e, Withoutten End!— Nae mair at present I've to say, But am your Friend. ODE To the Right Honourable Grace Countess of Aboyn, On her Marriage Day. In Martial Fields the Heroe toils, And wades throw Blood to purchase Fame; O'er dreadful Waves, from distant Soils, The Merchant brings his Treasures hame. But Fame and Wealth no Joys bestow, If plac'd alane they Cyphers stand; 'Tis to the Figure Love they owe The real Joys that they command. Blest He who Love and Beauty gains, Gains what contesting Kings might claim, Might bring brave Armies to the Plains, And loudly swell the Blast of Fame. How happy then is young ABOYN! Of how much Heaven is he possest! How much the Care of Pow'rs divine, Who lyes in lovely LOCKHART's Breast! Gazing in Raptures on thy Charms, Thy sparkling Beauty, Shape and Youth, He grasps all Softness in his Arms, And sips the Nectar from thy Mouth. If sympathetick Likeness crave Indulgent Parents to be kind, Each Pow'r shall guard the Charm they gave, Venus thy Face, Pallas thy Mind. O Muse, we could,—but stay thy Flight; The Field is sacred as 'tis sweet; Who dares to paint the ardent Night, When ravish'd Youth and Beauty meet? Here we must draw a Veil between, And shade those Joys too dazling clear, By ev'ry Eye not to be seen, Not to be heard by ev'ry Ear. Still in her Smiles, ye Cupids, play; Still in her Eyes your Revels keep; Her Pleasure be your Care by Day, And whisper Sweetness in her Sleep. Be banish'd, each ill natur'd Care, Base Offspring of fantastick Spleen; Of Access here you must despair, Her Breast for you is too serene. May Guardian Angels hover round Thy Head, and ward aff all Annoy; Be all thy Days with Raptures crown'd, And all thy Nights be blest with Joy. EPIGRAM. [Minerva wandring in a Myrtle Grove] Minerva wandring in a Myrtle Grove, Accosted thus the smiling Queen of Love, Revenge your self, you've Cause to be afraid, Your boasted Pow'r yields to a British Maid: She seems a Goddess, all her Graces shine; Love leads her Beauty, which eclipses thine. Each Youth, I know (says Venus) thinks she's me; Immediately she speaks, they think she's thee: Good Pallas, thus you're foil'd as well as I. Ha, ha! (crys Cupid) that's my MALY SLEIGH. On the Marriage of Alexander Brodie of Brodie, Lord Lyon King of Arms, and Mrs. Mary Sleigh. When Time was young, and Innocence, With tender Love govern'd this Round, No mean Design to give Offence To Constancy and Truth was found; All free from Fraud, upon the flow'ry Sward, Lovers carest with fond and chast Regard. From easy Labours of the Day Each Pair to Leafy Bowers retir'd; Contentment kept them ever gay, While kind connubial Sweets conspir'd, With smiling Quiet and balmy Health throu' Life, To make the happy Husband and the Wife. Our modern Wits in Wisdom less, With Spirits weak, and wavering Minds, Void of Resolve, poorly confess They cannot relish aught that binds. Let Libertines of Taste sae wond'rous nice, Despise to be confin'd in Paradise. While BRODIE with his beauteous SLEIGH, On purest Love can safely feast, Quaff Raptures from her sparkling Eye, And judge of Heaven within her Breast: No dubious Cloud to gloom upon his Joy, Possessing of what's Good can never cloy. Her Beauty might for ever warm, Altho' her Soul were less divine, The Brightness of her Mind could charm, Did less her graceful Beauties shine: But both united, with full Force inspire The warmest Wish, and the most lasting Fire. In your accomplish'd Mate, young Thane, Without Reserve ye may rejoice; The Heavens your Happiness sustain, And all that think, admire your Choice. Around your Treasure circling Arms entwine, Be all thy Pleasure her's, and her's be thine. Rejoice, dear MARY, in thy Youth, The first of his brave ancient Clan, Whose Soul delights in Love and Truth, And view'd in every Light a Man To whom the Fates with liberal Hand have given Good Sense, true Honour, and a Temper even. When Love and Reason thus unite An equal Pair in sacred Ties, They gain the humane Bliss complete, And Approbation from the Skies. Since you approve, kind Heaven, upon them pour The best of Blessings to their latest Hour. To you who rule above the Sun, To you who fly in fluid Air, We leave to finish what's begun, Still to reward and watch the Pair. Thus far the Muse, who did an Answer wait, And heard the Gods name Happiness their Fate. To Josiah Burchet Esq; On his being chosen Member of Parliament. My BURCHET's Name! well pleas'd, I saw Amang the chosen Leet, Wha are to give Britannia Law, And keep her Rights complete. O may the rest wha fill the House Be of a Mind with thee, And British Liberty espouse; We glorious Days may see. The Name of Patriot is mair great Than Heaps of ill win Gear: What boots an opulent Estate, Without a Conscience clear? While sneaking Sauls for Cash wad troke Their Country, GOD and King, With Pleasure we the Villain mock, And hate the worthless thing. With a' your Pith, the like of you, Superior to what's mean, Shou'd gar the truckling Rogues look blew, And cow them laigh and clean. Down with them,—down with a' that dare Oppose the Nation's Right; Sae may your Fame like a fair Star Throu' future Times shine bright. Sae may kind Heaven propitious prove, And grant what e'er ye crave; And him a Corner in your Love, Wha is your humble Slave. The General Mistake: A Satyre. Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable Lord Erskine. The finish'd Mind in all its Movements bright, Surveys the self-made Sumph in proper Light, Allows for native Weakness, but disdains Him who the Character with Labour gains: Permit me then, my Lord (since you arise With a clear Saul aboon the common Size) To place the following Sketches in your View; The Warld will like me, if I'm roos'd by You. Is there a Fool, frae Senator to Swain? Take ilk ane's Verdict for himsell,—there's nane. A thousand other Wants make thousands fret, But nane for want of Wisdom quarrels Fate. Alas! how gen'ral prove the great Mistake, When others throu' their Neighbours Failings rake? Detraction then, by Spite, is born too far, And represents Men warse than what they are. Come then, Impartial Satyre, fill the Stage With Fools of ilka Station, Sex and Age; Point out the Folly, hide the Person's Name, Since Obduration follows publick Shame: Silent Conviction calmly can reform, While open Scandal rages to a Storm. Proceed, but in the List, poor things forbear, Who only in the humane Form appear, Scarce animated with that heavenly Fire Which makes the Soul with boundless Thoughts aspire; Such move our Pity,—Nature is to blame— 'Tis Fools, in some things wise, that Satyre claim: Such as Nugator, mark his solemn Mien, Stay'd are his Features, scarcely move his Een, Which deep beneath his knoted Eye-brows sink, And he appears as ane wad guess to think; Even sae he does, and can exactly shaw How mony Beans make five, take three awa! Deep read in Latin Folio's, four Inch thick, He probs your crabit Points into the quick; Delights in dubious things to give Advice, Admires your Judgment, if you think him wise: And stifly stands by what he anes thought right, Altho' oppos'd with Reason's clearest Light. On him ilk Argument is thrown away, Speak what ye will, he tents not what you say: He hears himsell, and currently runs o'er All on the Subject he has said before; 'Till glad to ease his Jaws and tired Tongue, Th'Opponent rests,—Nugator thinks him dung. Thou solemn Trifler,—ken thou art despis'd, Thy stiff Pretence to Wisdom, nathing priz'd By sic as can their Notions fause decline, When Truth darts on them with convicting shine. How hateful's dull Opinion! prop'd with Words, That nought to any ane of Sense affords, But tiresome Jargon.—Learn to laugh, at least, That Part of what thou says may pass for Jest. Now turn your Eye to smooth Chicander next, In whom good Sense seems with good Humour mixt; But only seems:—For Envy, Malice, Guile, And sic base Vices, crowd behind his Smile. Nor can his Thoughts beyond mean Quirks extend, He thinks a Trick nae Crime that gains his End: A Crime! No, 'tis his Brag; he names it Wit, And triumphs o'er a better Man he 'as bit. Think shame Chicander of your creeping Slights, True Wisdom in Sincerity delights; The sumphish Mob of Penetration shawl, May gape and ferly at your cunning Saul, And make ye fancy that there is Desert In thus employing a' your sneaking Art. But do not think that Men of clearer Sense Will e'er admit of sic a vile Pretence, To that which dignifies the humane Mind, And acts in Honour with the bright and blind. Reverse of this fause Face, observe yon Youth, A strict plain Dealer, aft o'er stretching Truth; Severely sowr, he's ready to reprove The least wrang Step in those who have his Love: Yet what's of Worth in them he over-rates; But much they're to be pitied whom he hates. Here his Mistake, his weakest Side appears, When he a Character in Pieces tears; He gives nae Quarter, nor to great or sma', Even Beauty guards in vain; he lays at a'. This Humour, aften flowing o'er due Bounds, Too deeply mony a Reputation wounds; For which he's hated by the suffering Crowd, Who jointly 'gree to rail at him aloud, And as much shun his Sight and bitter Tongue, As they wad do a Wasp that had them stung. Censorious learn sometimes at Faults to wink, The wisest ever speak less than they think; Tho' thus superior Judgment you may vaunt, Yet this proud Worm-wood show o't, speaks a Want: A Want in which your Folly will be seen, Till you increase in Wit, and have less Spleen. Make way there,—when a mortal God appears! Why do ye laugh? King Midas wore sic Ears— How wise he looks? Well, wad he never speak, People wad think him neither dull nor weak: But ah! he fancies, 'cause he's chosen a Tool, That a furr'd Gown can free him frae the Fool; Straight he, with paughty Mien, and lordly Glooms, A vile affected Air, not his, assumes; Stawks stifly by, when better Men salute, Discovering less of Senator than Brute. Yet, is there e'er a wiser Man than he? Speer at himsell; and, if he will be free, He'll tell you, Nane.—Will Judges tell a Lie? But let him pass, and with a Smile observe Yon tatter'd Shadow, almaist like to starve; And yet he strutes, proud of his vast Ingine, He is an Author, writes exquisite fine: Sae fine, in Faith! that every vulgar Head Cannot conceive his Meaning while they read. He hates the World for this;—with bitter Rage He damns the stupid Dulness of the Age. The Printer is unpaid.—Booksellers swear, Ten Copies will not sell in ten lang Year: And wad not that sair fret a learned Mind, To see those shou'd be Patrons prove sae blind, Not to approve of what cost meikle Pains, Neglect of Bus'ness, Sleep, and waste of Brains? And a' for nought, but to be vilely us'd, As Pages are whilk Buyers have refus'd. Ah! Fellow Lab'rers for the Press, take heed, And force nae Fame that Way, if ye wad speed: Mankind must be (we have nae other) Judge, And if they are displeas'd, why should we grudge? If happily you gain them to your Side, Then bauldly mount your Pegasus, and ride: Value your sell only what they desire; What does not take, commit it to the Fire. Next him a Penman with a bluffer Air, Stands 'tween this twa best Friends that lull his Care, Nam'd Money in baith Pouches—with three Lines Yclipt a Bill, he digs the Indian Mines, Jobs, changes, lends, extorses, cheats and grips, And no ae Turn of gainfu' Us'ry slips, Till he has won, by wise Pretence and snell, As meikle as may drive his Bairns to Hell, His ain lang Hame.—This Sucker thinks nane wise, But him who can to immense Riches rise: Lear, Honour, Vertue, and sic heavenly Beams, To him appear but idle airy Dreams, Nor fit for Men of Business to mind, That are for great and golden Ends design'd. Send for him, Deel!—till then, good Men, take care To keep at Distance frae his Hook and Snare; He has nae Rewth, if Coin comes in the play, He'll draw, indorse, and horn to Death his Prey. Not thus Macsomno pushes after Praise, He treats, and is admir'd in all he says; Cash well bestow'd, which helps a Man to pass For wise in his ain thinking, that's an Ass: Poor Skybalds, curs'd with less of Wealth than Wit, Blyth of a gratis Gaudeamus, sit With Look attentive, ready all about, To give the Laugh when his dull Joke comes out; Accustom'd with his Conversation bright, They ken as by a Watch the time of Night, When he's at sic a Point of sic a Tale, Which to these Parasites grows never stale, Tho' often tald.—Like Lethe's Stream, his Wine Makes them forget!—that he again may shine. “Fy! Satyre hald thy Tongue, thou art too rude “To jeer a Character that seems sae good: “This Man may beet the Poet bare and clung, “That rarely has a Shilling in his Spung.” Hang him!—there's Patrons of good Sense enew To cherish and support the tuneful few, Whose Penetration's never at a Loss In right distinguishing of Gold frae Dross: Employ me freely, if thou'd Laurels wear, Experience may teach thee not to fear. But see anither gives mair Cause for Dread, He thraws his Gab, and aft he shakes his Head; A Slave to Self-conceit, and a' that's sowr, T'acknowledge Merit, is not in his Power: He reads,—but ne'er the Author's Beauties minds, And has nae Pleasure where nae Faults he finds. Much hated Gowk, tho' vers'd in kittle Rules, To be a Wirry-kow to writing Fools, Thy sell the greatest, only learn'd in Words, Which naithing but the cauld and dry affords. Dar'st thou of a' thy Betters slighting speak, That have na grutten sae meikle learning Greek: Thy Depths well kend, and a' thy silly Vaunts, To ilka solid Thinker shaw thy Wants. Thus Cowards deave us with a thousand Lies Of dangerous Vict'ries they have won in Pleas. Sae shallow Upstarts strive with Care to hide Their mean Descent (which inly gaws their Pride) By counting Kin, and making endless Faird, If that their Grany's Uncle's Oye's a Laird. Scar-crows, Hen-hearted, and ye meanly born, Appear just what ye are, and dread nae Scorn; Labour in Words,—keep hale your Skins: Why not? Do well, and nane your laigh Extract will quote, But to your Praise.—Walk aff, till we remark Yon little coxy Wight, that makes sic Wark With Tongue and Gate: How crously does he stand? His Taes turn'd out, on his left Haunch his Hand; The right beats Time a hundred various Ways, And points the Pathos out in a' he says. Wow! but he's proud! when almaist out of Breath, At ony time he clatters a Man to Death, Wha is oblig'd sometime t'attend the Sot, To save the captiv'd Buttons of his Coat. Thou dinsome Jack-daw, ken 'tis a Disease This Palsy in thy Tongue that ne'er can please; Of a' Mankind, thou art the maist mistane To think this Way the Name of Sage to gain. Now, lest I shou'd be thought too much like thee, I'll give my Readers leave to breathe a wee; If they allow my Pictur's like the Life, Mae shall be drawn; Originals are rife. The Phœnix and the Owl. Phoenix the first, th'Arabian Lord, And Chief of all the feather'd Kind, A hundred Ages had ador'd The Sun, with Sanctity of Mind. Yet, mortal, he maun yield to Fate, He heard the Summons with a Smile, And unalarm'd, without Regret, He form'd himsell a Fun'ral Pile. A Howlet, Bird of mean Degree, Poor, dosen'd, lame, and doited auld, Lay lurking in a neighb'ring Tree, Cursing the Sun loot him be cauld. Said Phœnix, Brother, why so griev'd, To ban the Being gives thee Breath? Learn to die better than thou'st liv'd; Believe me, there's nae Ill in Death. Believe ye that? the Owl reply'd; Preach as ye will, Death is an Ill: When young I ilka Pleasure try'd, But now I die against my Will. For you, a Species by your sell, Near Eeldins with the Sun your God, Nae Ferly 'tis to hear you tell, Ye're tired, and incline to nod. It shou'd be sae; for had I been As lang upon the Warld as ye, Nae Tears shou'd e'er drap frae my Een, For Tinsel of my hollow Tree. And what, return'd the Arabian Sage, Have ye t'observe ye have not seen? Ae Day's the Picture of an Age, 'Tis ay the same thing o'er again. Come, let us baith togither die: Bow to the Sun that gave thee Life; Repent thou frae his Beams did flee, And end thy Poortith, Pain and Strife. Thou wha in Darkness took Delight, Frae Twangs of Guilt could'st ne'er be free: What won thou by thy shunning Light?— But Time flees on;—I haste to die. Ye'r Servant, Sir, reply'd the Owl, I likena in the Dark to lowp: The Byword ca's that Cheil a Fool, That slips a Certainty for Hope. Then straight the zealous feather'd King To's Aromatick Nest retir'd, Collected Sun-beams with his Wing, And in a spicy Flame expir'd. Mean time there blew a Westlin Gale, Which to the Howlet bore a Coal; The Saint departed on his Pile, But the Blasphemer in his Hole. He died for ever,—fair and bright; The Phœnix frae his Ashes sprang, Thus wicked Men sink down to Night, While just Men join the glorious Thrang. To the Honourable Sir John Clerk of Pennycuik Baronet, one of the Barons of Exchequer, on the Death of his most accomplished Son John Clerk Esq; who died the 20th Year of his Age. If Tears can ever be a Duty found, 'Tis when the Deaths of dear Relations wound; Then you must weep, you have too just a Ground. A Son whom all the Good and Wise admir'd, Shining with ev'ry Grace to be desir'd; Rais'd high your joyful Hopes, and then retir'd. Nature must yield, when such a weighty Load Rouzes the Passions, and makes Reason nod: But who may contradict the Will of GOD! By his great Author, Man was sent below, Some Things to learn, great Pains to undergo, To fit him for what further he's to know. This End obtain'd, without regarding Time, He calls the Soul home to its native Clime, To Happiness and Knowledge more sublime. Thus some in Youth like Eagles mount the Steep, Which leads to Man, and fathom Learning's Deep; Others thro' Age with reptile Motion creep. Like lazy Streams which fill the Fenny Strand, In muddy Pools they long unactive stand, Till spent in Vapour, or immers'd in Sand. But down its flinty Channel, without Stain, The Mountain Rill flows eagerly to gain, With a full Tide, its Origine the Main. Thus your lov'd Youth, whose bright aspiring Mind Could not to lazy Minutes be confin'd, Sail'd down the Stream of Life before the Wind. Perform'd the Task of Man, so well, so soon, He reach'd the Sea of Bliss before his Noon, And to his Memory lasting Laurels won. When Life's tempestuous Billows ceas'd to rore, And e'er his broken Vessel was no more, His Soul serenely view'd the heavenly Shore. Bravely resign'd, obeying Fate's Command, He fix'd his Eyes on the immortal Land, Where crowding Seraphs reach'd him out the Hand. SOUTHESKA's smiling Cherub James Lord Carnegie. See p. 31. first appear'd, With GARLIES' Consort Lady Garlies, p. 33; both his near relations., who vast Pleasures shar'd, Conducting him where Vertue finds Reward. Think in the World of Sp'rits, with how much Joy His tender Mother would receive her Boy. Where Fate no more their Union can destroy. His good Grandsire, who lately went to Rest, How fondly would he grasp him to his Breast, And welcome him to Regions of the Blest! From us, 'tis true, his youthful Sweets are gone, Which may plead for our Weakness, when we moan; The Loss indeed is ours, he can have none. Thus Sailors with a crazy Vessel crost, Expecting every Minute to be lost, With weeping Eyes behold a Sunny Coast. Where happy Land-men safely breathe the Air, Bask in the Sun, or to cool Shades repair, They longing sigh, and wish themselves were there. But who would after Death to Bliss lay Claim, Must, like your Son, each vicious Passion tame, Fly from the Crowd, and at Perfection aim. Then grieve no more, nor vex your self in vain, To latest Age the Character maintain You now possess, you'll find your Son again. On receiving a Letter to be present at the Burial of Mr. Robert Alexander of Blackhouse. Thou sable border'd Sheet be gone, Harbour to thee I must refuse; Sure thou canst Welcome find from none, Who carries such ungrateful News. Who can attend thy mournful Tale, And ward his Soul from piercing Woe? In viewing thee, Grief must prevail, And Tears from gushing Eyes o'erflow From Eyes of all that knew the Man, And in his Friendship had a Share; Who all the World's Affections won, By Vertues that all natural were. His Merits dazle, while we view, His Goodness is a Theme so full, The Muse wants Strength to pay what's due, While Estimation prompts the Will. But she endeavours to make known To farest down Posterity, That good BLACKHOUSE was such an one As every one should wish to be. The Fair Assembly: A Poem. Awake, Thalia, and defend, With chearfu' carrolling, Thy bonny Care,—thy Wings extend, And bear me to your Spring; That Harmony full Force may lend To Reasons that I bring:— Now Caledonian Nymphs attend, For 'tis to you I sing. As lang as Minds maun Organs wear, Compos'd of Flesh and Blood, We ought to keep them hale and clear, The Wise for Health on Exercise depend, GOD never made his Works for Man to mend. Dryd.With Exercise and Food. Then, but Debate, it will appear That Dancing must be good, It stagnant Humours sets a steer, And fines the purple Flood. Diseases, Heaviness and Spleen, And ill things mony mae, That gar the Lazy fret and grane, With Visage dull and blae. 'Tis Dancing can do mair alane, Than Drugs frae far away, To ward aff these, make nightly Pain, And sowr the shining Day. Health is a Prize;—yet meikle mair In Dancing we may find; It adds a Lustre to the Fair, And, when the Fates unkind Cloud with a blate and aukward Air A Genius right refin'd, Since nothing appears to me to give Children so much becoming Confidence and Behaviour, and so raise them to the Conversation of those above their Age, as Dancing; I think they should be taught to dance as soon as they are capable of learning it. For tho' this consists only in outward Gracefulness of Motion; yet I know not how, it gives manly Thoughts and Carriage more than any thing. Lock.The sprightly Art helps to repair This Blemish on the Mind. How mony do we daily see, It is certain, that for want of a competent Knowledge in this Art of Dancing, which should have been learned when young, the Publick loses many a Man of exquisite Intellectuals and unbyass'd Probity, purely for Want of that so necessary Accomplishment, Assurance; while the pressing Knave or Fool shoulders him out, and gets the Prize. Mr. Weaver.Right scrimp of Wit and Sense, Wha gain their Aims aft easily By well bred Confidence? Then what e'er helps to qualifie A rustick Negligence, Maun without doubt a Duty be, And shou'd give nae Offence. Hell's Doctrine's dung, when equal Pairs Together join their Hands, And vow to sooth ilk other's Cares, In haly Wedlock Bands: Sae when to dance the Maid prepares, And flush'd with Sweetness stands, At her the wounded Lover stares, And yields to Heaven's Commands. The first Command Dixit eis Deus, Fœtificate, augescite &amp; implete terram. he soon obeys, While Love inspires ilk Notion; His wishing Look his Heart displays, While his lov'd Mate's in Motion: He views her with a blyth Amaze, And drinks with deep Devotion That happy Draught, that throu' our Days Is own'd a cordial Potion. The Cordial which conserves our Life, And makes it smooth and easy: Then, ilka Wanter, wale a Wife, E'er Eild and Humdrums seize ye, Whase Charms can silence Dumps or Strife, And frae the Rake release ye, Attend th'Assembly, where there's Rife Of vertuous Maids to please ye. These modest Maids inspire the Muse, In flowing Strains to shaw Their Beauties, which she likes to roose, And let the Envious blaw: That Task she canna well refuse, Wha sinle says them Na.— To paint Bellinda first we chuse, With Breasts like driven Snaw. Like Lilly-banks see how they rise, With a fair Glen between, Where living Streams, blew as the Skies, Are branching upward seen, To warm her Mouth, where Rapture lyes, And Smiles, that banish Spleen, Wha strikes with Love and saft Surprise, Where e'er she turns her Een. SABELLA gracefully complete, Straight as the Mountain Pine, Like Pearls and Rubies set in Jet, Her lovely Features shine: In her the Gay and Solid meet, And blended are sae fine, That when she moves her Lips or Feet, She seems some Power Divine. O Daphne! sweeter than the Dawn, When Rays glance on the Height, Diffusing Gladness o'er the Lawn, With Strakes of rising Light. The dewy Flowers when newly blawn, Come short of that Delight, Which thy far fresher Beauties can Afford our joyfu' Sight. How easy sits sweet Celia's Dress, Her Gate how gently free; Her Steps, throu'out the Dance, express The justest Harmony: And when she sings, all must confess, Wha're blest to hear and see, They'd deem't their greatest Happiness T'enjoy her Company. And wha can ca' his Heart his ain, That hears Aminta speak? Against Love's Arrows, Shields are vain, When he aims frae her Cheek; Her Cheek, where Roses free from Stain, In Glows of Youdith beek: Unmingl'd Sweets her Lips retain; These Lips she ne'er shou'd steek, Unless when fervent Kisses close That Av'new of her Mind, Thro' which true Wit in Torrents flows, As speaks the Nymph design'd: The Brag and Toast of Wits and Beaus, And Wonder of Mankind; Whase Breast will prove a blest Repose To him with whom she'll bind. See with what Gayety, yet grave, Serena swims alang; She moves a Goddess 'mang the lave, Distinguish'd in the Thrang. Ye Sourocks, hafflines Fool, haf Knave, Wha hate a Dance or Sang, To see this stately Maid behave, 'Twad gi'e your Hearts a Twang. Your Hearts! said I, trowth I'm to blame, I had amaist forgotten, That ye to nae sic Organ claim; Or if ye do, 'tis rotten. A Saul with sic a thowless Flame, Is sure a silly Sot ane: Ye scandalize the humane Frame, When in our Shape begotten. These Lurdanes came just in my Light, As I was tenting Chloe, With jet black Een that sparkle bright, She's all o'er form'd for Joy; With Neck and Waist, and Limbs as tight As her's wha drew the Boy, Frae feeding Flocks upon the Height, And fled with him to Troy. Now Myra dances; mark her Mien, Sae disengag'd and gay, Mixt with that Innocence that's seen In bonny Ew-bught May, Wha wins the Garland on the Green Upon some Bridal-Day; Yet she has Graces for a Queen, And might a Scepter sway. What Lays, Calista, can commend The Beauties of thy Face! Whase Fancy can sae touring stend, Thy Merits a' to trace! Frae 'boon the Starns, some Bard, descend, And sing her ev'ry Grace, Whase wondrous Worth may recommend Her to a God's Embrace. A Seraph wad our Aikman paint, Or draw a lively Wit; The Features of a happy Saint, Say, art thou fond to hit? Or a Madona compliment, With Lineaments maist fit? Fair Copies thou need'st never want, If bright Calista sit. MELLA the heaviest Heart can heez, And sowrest Thoughts expell, Her Station grants her Rowth and Ease, Yet is the sprightly Belle As active as the eydent Bees, Wha rear the Waxen Cell; And, place her in what Light you please, She still appears hersell. Beauties on Beauties come in view Sae thick, that I'm afraid I shall not pay to Ilk their Due, Till Phœbus lend mair Aid: But this in gen'ral will had true, And may be safely said, There's ay a Something shining new In ilk delicious Maid. Sic as against th'Assembly speak, The rudest Sauls betray, When Matrons noble, wise and meek, Conduct the healthfu' Play: Where they appear, nae Vice dare keek, But to what's good gives way, Like Night, soon as the Morning Creek Has usher'd in the Day. Dear Ed'nburgh, shaw thy Gratitude, And of sic Friends make sure, Wha strive to make our Minds less rude, And help our Wants to cure; Acting a gen'rous Part and good, In Bounty to the Poor: Sic Vertues, if right understood, Shou'd ev'ry Heart alure. On the Royal Company of Archers, shooting for the Bowl, July 6th, 1724. On which Day his Grace JAMES Duke of Hamilton was chosen their Captain General; and Mr. David Drummond their Præses won the Prize. Again the Year returns the Day, That's dedicate to Joy and Play, To Bonnets, Bows and Wine. Let all who wear a sullen Face, This Day meet with a due Disgrace, And in their Sowrness pine; Be shun'd as Serpents, that wad stang The Hand that gi'es them Food: Sic we debar frae lasting Sang, And all their grumbling Brood. While, to gain Sport and halesome Air, The blythsome Spirit draps dull Care, And starts frae Bus'ness free: Now to the Fields the Archers bend, With friendly Minds the Day to spend, In manly Game and Glee; First striving wha shall win the Bowl, And then gar't flow with Wine: Sic manly Sport refresh'd the Soul Of stalwart Men lang syne. E'er Parties thrawn, and Int'rest vile, Debauch'd the Grandeur of our Isle, And made ev'n Brethren Faes: Syne Truth frae Friendship was exil'd, And fause the honest Hearts beguil'd, And led them in a Maze Of Politicks;—with cunning Craft, The Issachars of State, Frae haly Drums first dang us daft, Then drown'd us in Debate. Drap this unpleasing Thought, dear Muse; Come, view the Men thou likes to roose; To Bruntsfield Green let's hy, And see the Royal Bowmen strive, Wha far the feather'd Arrows drive, All soughing thro' the Sky; Ilk ettling with his utmost Skill, With artfu' Draught and stark, Extending Nerves with hearty Will, In hopes to hit the Mark. See HAMILTON, wha moves with Grace, Chief of the Caledonian Race Of Peers; to whom is due All Honours, and a' fair Renown; Wha lays aside his Ducal Crown, Sometime to shade his Brow Beneath St. Andrew's Bonnet blew, And joins to gain the Prize: Which shaws true Merit match'd by few, Great, affable and wise. This Day, with universal Voice, The Archers Him their Chiftain chose; Consenting Powers divine, They blest the Day with general Joy, By giving him a princely Boy, To beautify his Line; Whose Birth-day, in immortal Sang Shall stand in fair Record, While bended Strings the Archers twang, And Beauty is ador'd. Next DRUMMOND view, who gives their Law; It glads our Hearts to see him draw The Bow, and guide the Band; He, like the Saul of a' the lave, Does with sic Honour still behave, As merits to command. Blyth be his Hours, heal be his Heart, And lang may he preside: Lang the just Fame of his Desert Shall unborn Archers read. How on this fair propitious Day, With Conquest leal he bore away The Bowl victoriously; With following Shafts in Number four, Success the like ne'er kend before, The Prize to dignify. Haste to the Garden then bedeen, The Rose and Laurel pow, And plet a Wreath of white and green, To busk the Victor's Brow. The Victor crown, who with his Bow, In Spring of Youth and am'rous Glow, Just fifty Years sinsyne, The Silver Arrow made his Prize, Yet ceases not in Fame to rise, And with new Feats to shine. May every Archer strive to fill His Bonnet, and observe The Pattern he has set with Skill, And Praise like him deserve. On the Royal Company of Archers, marching under the Command of his Grace Duke of Hamilton, in their proper Habits, to shoot for the Arrow at Musselburgh, August 4, 1724. Apollo, Patron of the Lyre, And of the valiant Archers Bow, Me with sic Sentiments inspire, As may appear from thee they flow, When, by thy special Will, and high Command, I sing the Merits of the Royal Band. Now like themsells again the Archers raise The Bow, in brave Aray, and claim our Lays. Phœbus well pleased, shines from the blew Serene, Glents on the Stream, and guilds the checquer'd Green. The Winds ly hush in their remotest Caves, And Forth with gentle Swell his Margin leaves. See to his Shore, the gathering Thousands roll, As if one gen'ral Sp'rit inform'd the whole. The bonniest Fair of a' Great Britain's Isle, From Chariots and the crowded Casements smile; Whilst Horse and Foot promiscuous form a Lane, Extending far along the destin'd Plain, Where, like Bellona's Troops, or Guards of Love, The Archers in their proper Habits move. Their Guardian Saint, from yon etherial Height, Displays th'auspicious Cross of blazing Light; While on his Care he chearfully looks down, The pointed Thistle wears his ruby Crown, And seems to threat, arm'd ready to engage, No Man unpunish'd shall provoke my Rage. Well pleas'd the rampant Lyon smooths his Mane, And gambols gay upon his golden Plain. Likeas the Sun, when wintry Clouds are past, And fragrant Gales succeed the stormy Blast, Shines on the Earth, the Fields look fresh and gay; So seem the Archers on this joyful Day: Whilst with his graceful Mien, and Aspect kind, Their Leader raises every Follower's Mind, Who love the Conduct of a Youth, whose Birth To nothing yields but his superior Worth; And happier is with his selected Train, Than Philip's Son who strove a World to gain. That Prince whole Nations to Destruction drove, This Prince delights his Country to improve. A Monarch rais'd upon a Throne may nod, And pass amongst the Vulgar for a God; Whilst Men of Penetration justly blame Those who hang on their Ancestors for Fame; But own the Dignity of high Descent, When the Successor's Spirit keeps the Bent, Which through revolving Ages grac'd the Line, With all those Qualities that brightest shine: The Archers Chiftain thus with active Mind, In all that's worthy never falls behind These noble Characters, from whom he sprung, In Hist'ry fam'd: Whom ancient Bards have sung. See, from his steady Hand, and aiming Eye, How straight in equal Lengths the Arrows fly: Both at one End close by the Mark they stand, Which points him worthy of his brave Command; That as they to his num'rous Merits bow, This Victory makes Homage fully due. Sage Drummond next, the Chief, with Counsel grave, Becomes his Post, instructing all that's brave: So Pallas seem'd, who Mentor's Form put on, To make a Heroe of Ulysses' Son. Each Officer his Character maintains, While Love and Honour gratify their Pains. No View inferior brings them to the Field, To whom great Chiefs of Clans with Pleasure yield. No hidden Murmure swells the Archer's Heart, While each with Gladness acts his proper Part. No factious Strife, nor Plots, the Bane of States, Give Birth to Jealousies or dire Debates: Nor less their Pleasure who Obedience pay, Good Order to preserve, as those who sway. O smiling Muse, full well thou knows the Fair; Admire the Courteous, and with Pleasure share Their Love with him that's generous and brave, And can with manly Dignity behave; Then haste to warn thy tender Care with Speed, Lest by some Random-shaft their Hearts may bleed. Yon dangerous Youths both Mars and Venus arm, While with their double Darts they threat and charm; Those at their Side forbid invading Foes, With vain Attempt true Courage to oppose; While Shafts mair subtile, darted from their Eye, Thro' softer Hearts with silent Conquest fly. To the Right Honourable Earl of Hartford, Lord Peircy, President, and the rest of the Honourable Members of the Society of British Antiquarians. A Scots Ode. To HARTFORD and his learned Friends, Whase Fame for Science far extends, A Scottish Muse her Duty sends, From Pictish Towers: Health, Length of Days, and happy Ends, Be ever yours. Your generous Cares make Light arise From things obscure to vulgar Eyes, Finding where hidden Knowledge lies, T'improve the Mind; And most delightfully surprise, With Thoughts refin'd. When you the broke Inscription read, Or amongst antique Ruins tread, And view Remains of Princes dead, In Funeral Piles, Your Penetration seems decreed To bless these Isles, Where Romans form'd their Camps of old, Their Gods and Urns of curious Mold, Their Medals struck of Brass or Gold, 'Tis you can show, And Truth of what's in Story told, To you we owe. How beneficial is the Care, That brightens up the Classick Lere! When you the Documents compare, With Authors old, You ravish, when we can so fair Your Light behold. Without your Comments, each old Book By all the World would be forsook: For who of Thought wou'd deign to look, On doubtful Works, 'Till by your skilful Hands they're struck With Sterling Marks? By this your Learning Men are fir'd With Love of Glory, and inspir'd Like ancient Heroes, who ne'er tir'd To win a Name; And, by their God-like Acts, aspir'd T'immortal Fame. Your useful Labours shall endure, True Merit shall your Fame secure, And will Posterity allure, To search about For Truth, by Demonstration sure, Which leaves no Doubt. The Muse forsees brave HARTFORD's Name Shall to all Writers be a Theme, To last while Arts and Greatness claim Th'Historian's Skill, Or the chief Instrument of Fame, The Poet's Quill. PEMBROKE's a Name to Britain dear, For Learning and brave Deeds of Wier; The Genius still continues clear In him whose Art, In your rare Fellowship can bear So great a Part. Bards yet unborn shall tune their Lays, And Monuments harmonious raise To WINCHELSEA and DEVON's Praise, Whose high Desert, And Vertues bright, like genial Rays, Can Life impart. Nor want we Caledonians Sage, Who read the painted Vellum Page, No Strangers to each antique Stage, And Druids Cells, And sacred Ruins of each Age, On Plains and Fells. Amongst all those of the first Rate, Our learned Sir John Clerk of Pennycuik, Baronet. CLERK blest with the Fate Of thinking right, can best relate These Beauties all, Which bear the Marks of ancient Date, Be-north the Wall. The Wall which Hadrian first begun, And bold Severus carried on, From Rising to the Setting Sun, On Britain's Coast, Our Ancestors fierce Arms to shun, Which gall'd them most. But now no need of Walls or Towers, Ag'd Enmity no more endures, Brave Britain joins her warlike Powers, That always dare, To open and to shut the Doors Of Peace and War. Advance, great Men, your wise Design, And prosper in the Task divine; Draw from Antiquity's deep Mine, The precious Ore, And in the British Annals shine, Till Time's no more. On the Marquis of Annandale's conveying me a Present of Guineas in my Snuff-mill, after he had taken all the Snuff. The Chief requir'd my Snishing-mill, And well it was bestow'd; The Patron, by the rarest Skill, Turn'd all the Snuff to Gowd. Gowd stampt with Royal Anna's Face, Piece after Piece came forth; The Pictures smil'd, gi'en with such Grace, By ane of so much Worth. Sure thus the patronizing Roman Made Horace spread the Wing; Thus Dorset, by kind Deeds uncommon, Rais'd Prior up to sing. That there are Patrons yet for me, Here's a convincing Proof, Since ANNANDALE gives Gowd as free, As I can part with Snuff. The Monk and the Miller's Wife. A Tale. Now lend your Lugs, ye Benders fine, Wha ken the Benefit of Wine; And you wha laughing scud brown Ale, Leave Jinks a wee, and hear a Tale. An honest Miller wond in Fife, That had a young and wanton Wife, Wha sometimes thol'd the Parish Priest To mak her Man a twa-horn'd Beast: He paid right mony Visits till her; And to keep in with Hab the Miller, He endeavour'd aft to mak him happy, Where e'er he kend the Ale was nappy. Sic Condescension in a Pastor, Knit Halbert's Love to him the faster; And by his Converse, troth 'tis true, Hab learn'd to preach when he was fou. Thus all the three were wonder pleas'd, The Wife well serv'd, the Men well eas'd. This ground his Corns, and that did cherish Himsell with dining round the Parish. Bess the Good-wife thought it nae Skaith, Since she was able to serve them baith. When equal is the Night and Day, And Ceres gives the Schools the Play, A Youth sprung frae a gentle Pater, Bred at Saint Andro's Alma Mater, Ae Day gawn hameward, it fell late, And him benighted by the Gate: To ly without, Pit-mirk did shore him; He coudna see his Thumb before him: But, Clack,—clack,—clack, he heard a Mill, Whilk led him be the Lugs theretill. To tak the threed of Tale alang, This Mill to Halbert did belang. Not less this Note your Notice claims, The Scholar's Name was Master James. Now, smiling Muse, the Prelude past, Smoothly relate a Tale shall last As lang as Alps and Grampian Hills, As lang as Wind or Water-mills. In enter'd James, Hab saw and kend him, And offer'd kindly to befriend him With sic good Chear as he cou'd make, Baith for his ain and Father's Sake. The Scholar thought himsell right sped, And gave him Thanks in Terms well bred. Quoth Hab, I canna leave my Mill As yet;—but step ye west the Kill A Bow-shot, and ye'll find my Hame: Gae warm ye, and crack with our Dame, Till I set aff the Mill; syne we Shall tak what Bessy has to gi'e. James, in Return, what's handsome said, O'er lang to tell; and aff he gade. Out of the House some Light did shine, Which led him till't as with a Line: Arriv'd, he knock'd; for Doors were steekit; Straight throw a Window Bessy keekit, And cries, “Wha's that gie's Fowk a Fright “At sic untimous time of Night?” James with good Humour, maist discreetly, Tald her his Circumstance completely. “I dinna ken ye, quoth the Wife, “And up and down the Thieves are rife: “Within my lane, I'm but a Woman; “Sae I'll unbar my Door to nae Man. “But since 'tis very like, my Dow, “That all ye're telling may be true, “Hae there's a Key, gang in your Way “At the neist Door, there's braw Ait Strae; “Streek down upon't, my Lad, and learn, “They're no ill lodg'd that get a Barn.” Thus after meikle Clitter-clatter, James fand he coudna mend the Matter; And since it might not better be, With Resignation took the Key, Unlockt the Barn,—clam up the Mou, Where there was an Opening near the Hou, Throw whilk he saw a Glent of Light, That gave Diversion to his Sight: By this he quickly cou'd discern A thin Wa' separate House and Barn, And throw this Rive was in the Wa', All done within the House he saw: He saw (what ought not to be seen, And scarce gave Credit to his Een) The Parish Priest of reverend Fame In active Courtship with the Dame.— To lengthen out Description here, Wou'd but offend the modest Ear, And beet the lewder youthfu' Flame, That we by Satyre strive to tame. Suppose the wicked Action o'er, And James continuing still to glowre; Wha saw the Wife, as fast as able, Spread a clean Servite on the Table, And syne, frae the Ha' Ingle, bring ben A pyping het young roasted Hen, And twa good Bottles stout and clear, Ane of strong Ale, and ane of Beer. But wicked Luck, just as the Priest Shot in his Fork in Chucky's Breast, Th'unwelcome Miller ga'e a Roar, Cry'd, Bessy, haste ye open the Door.— With that the haly Letcher fled, And darn'd himsell behind a Bed; While Bessy huddl'd a' things by, That nought the Cuckold might espy; Syne loot him in;—but out of tune, Speer'd why he left the Mill sae soon, I come, said he, as Manners claims, To crack and wait on Master James, Whilk I shou'd do, tho' ne'er sae bissy: I sent him here, Goodwife, where is he? “Ye sent him here! (quoth Bessy, grumbling;) “Kend I this James! A Chiel came rumbling: “But how was I assur'd, when dark, “That he had been nae thievish Spark, “Or some rude Wencher, gotten a Dose, “That a weak Wife cou'd ill oppose?” And what came of him? speak nae langer, Crys Halbert in a Highland Anger. “I sent him to the Barn,” quoth she. Gae quickly bring him in, quoth he. JAMES was brought in;—the Wife was bawked; The Priest stood close;—the Miller cracked:— Then ask'd his sunkan gloomy Spouse, What Supper had she in the House, That might be suitable to gi'e, Ane of their Lodger's Qualitie? Quoth she, “Ye may well ken, Goodman, “Your Feast comes frae the Pottage-Pan: “The Stov'd or Roasted we afford, “Are aft great Strangers on our Board.” Pottage, quoth Hab, ye senseless Tawpie! Think ye this Youth's a Gilly-gawpy; And that his gentle Stamock's master To worry up a Pint of Plaister, Like our Mill Knaves that lift the Laiding, Whase Kytes can streek out like raw Plaiding. Swith roast a Hen, or fry some Chickens, And send for Ale frae Maggy Pickens. “Hout I, quoth she, ye may well ken, “'Tis ill brought butt that's no there ben; “When but last Owk, nae farder gane, “The Laird got a' to pay his Kain.” Then James, wha had as good a Guess Of what was in the House as Bess, With pawky Smile, this Plea to end, To please himsell, and ease his Friend, First open'd with a slee Oration His wond'rous Skill in Conjuration. Said he, “By this fell Art I'm able “To whop aff any great Man's Table “What e'er I like, to make a Mail of, “Either in part, or yet the haill off; “And if ye please, I'll shaw my Art.—” Crys Halbert, Faith with a' my Heart! Bess sain'd herself,—cry'd LORD be here! And near hand fell a swoon for Fear. James leugh, and bade her nathing dread, Syne to his Conjuring went with Speed; And first he draws a Circle round, Then utters mony a magick Sound, Of Words part Latin, Greek and Dutch, Enow to fright a very Witch: That done, he says, Now, now 'tis come, And in the Boal beside the Lum: Now set the Board; Goodwife, gae ben, Bring frae yon Boal a roasted Hen. She wadna gang, but Haby ventur'd; And soon as he the Ambrie enter'd, It smell'd sae well, he short time sought it, And, wondring, 'tween his Hands he brought it. He view'd it round, and thrice he smell'd it, Syne with a gentle Touch he felt it. Thus ilka Sense he did conveen, Lest Glamour had beguil'd his Een: They all, in an united Body, Declar'd it a fine fat How-towdy. Nae mair about it, quoth the Miller, The Fowl looks well, and we'll fa' till her. Sae be't, says James; and in a doup, They snapt her up baith Stoup and Roup. “Neist, O! crys Halbert, cou'd your Skill, “But help us to a Waught of Ale, “I'd be oblig'd t'ye a' my Life, “And offer to the Deel my Wife, “To see if he'll discreeter make her, “But that I'm fleed he winna take her.” Said James, Ye offer very fair; The Bargain's hadden, say nae mair. Then thrice he shook a Willow Wand, With kittle Words thrice gave Command; That done, with Look baith learn'd and grave, Said, Now ye'll get what ye wad have; Twa Bottles of as nappy Liquor, As ever ream'd in Horn or Bicquor, Behind the Ark that hads your Meal, Ye'll find twa standing corkit well. He said, and fast the Miller flew, And frae their Nest the Bottles drew; Then first the Scholar's Health he toasted, Whase Art had gart him feed on roasted; His Father's neist,—and a' the rest Of his good Friends that wish'd him best, Which were o'er langsome at the time, On a short Tale to put in Rhime. Thus while the Miller and the Youth, Were blythly slock'ning of their Drowth, Bess fretting scarcely held frae greeting, The Priest enclos'd stood vex'd and sweating. O wow! said Hab, if ane might speer, Dear Master James, wha brought our Chear? Sic Laits appear to us sae awfu', We hardly think your Learning lawfu'. “To bring your Doubts to a Conclusion, “Says James, ken I'm a Rosiecrucian, “Ane of the Set that never carries “On traffick with black Deels or Fairies: “There's mony a Sp'rit that's no a Deel, “That constantly around us wheel. “There was a Sage call'd Albumazor, “Whase Wit was gleg as ony Razor. “Frae this great Man we learn'd the Skill, “To bring these Gentry to our Will; “And they appear when we've a mind, “In ony Shape of humane Kind: “Now, if you'll drap your foolish Fear, “I'll gar my Pacolet appear.” HAB fidg'd and leugh, his Elbuck clew, Baith fear'd and fond a Sp'rit to view: At last his Courage wan the Day, He to the Scholar's Will gave way. BESSY be this began to smell A Rat, but kept her Mind to'r sell: She pray'd like Howdy in her Drink, But mean time tipt young James a Wink. James frae his Eye an Answer sent, Which made the Wife right well content. Then turn'd to Hab, and thus advis'd, “What e'er ye see, be nought surpriz'd; “But for your Saul move not your Tongue, “And ready stand with a great Rung; “Syne as the Sp'rit gangs marching out, “Be sure to lend him a sound Rout. “I bidna this be way of Mocking; “For nought delytes him mair than Knocking.” HAB got a Kent,—stood by the Hallan; And straight the wild mischievous Callan, Cries, “Radamanthus Husky Mingo, “Monk-horner, Hipock, Jinko, Jingo, “Appear in Likeness of a Priest, “No like a Deel in Shape of Beast, “With gaping Chafts to fleg us a'. “Wauk forth; the Door stands to the Wa'.” Then frae the Hole where he was pent, The Priest approach'd right well content, With silent Pace strade o'er the Floor, Till he was drawing near the Door; Then, to escape the Cudgel, ran; But was not miss'd by the Goodman, Wha lent him on the Neck a Lounder, That gart him o'er the Threshold founder. Darkness soon hid him frae their Sight; Ben flew the Miller in a Fright: I trow, quoth he, I laid well on; But wow he's like our ain Mess John! Advice to Mr.?on his Marriage. All Joy to you and your Amelie, May ne'er your Purse nor Vigour fail ye; But have a Care how you employ Them baith; and tutor well your Joy. Frae me an auld Dab tak Advice, And hane them baith, if ye be wise; For Warld's Wasters, like poor Cripples, Look blunt with Poverty and Ripples: There an auld Saw to ilk ane notum, Better to save at Braird than Bottom; Which means, your Purse and Person use As canny Poets do their Muse; For Whip and Spurring never prove Effectual, or in Verse or Love. Sae far, my Friend, in merry Strain, I've given a douse Advice and plain, And honestly discharg'd my Conscience In Lines (tho' hamely) far frae Nonsense. Some other Chiel may daftly sing, That kens but little of the thing, And blaw ye up with windy Fancies That he has thigit frae Romances, Of endless Raptures, constant Glee, That never was, or ne'er will be. Alake! poor Mortals are not Gods, And therefore often fall at Odds; But little Quarrels now and than Are nae great Faults 'tween Wife and Man: These help right aften to improve His Understanding and her Love. Your Rib and you, 'bout Hours of drinking, May chance to differ in your thinking; But that's just like a Shower in May, That gars the Sun-blink seem mair gay. If e'er she tak the Pet, or fret, Be calm, and yet maintain your State; And smiling, ca' her little Foolie, Syne with a Kiss evite a Toolie. This Method's ever thought the braver, Than either Cuffs, or Clish-ma-claver. It shaws a Spirit low and common, That with ill Nature treats a Woman: They're of a Make sae nice and fair, They must be manag'd with some Care; Respect them, they'll be kind and civil, But disregarded, prove the Devil. To Mrs. M. M. on her Painting. To paint his Venus, auld Apelles Wal'd a' the bonny Maids of Greece: Thou needs nae mair, but paint thy sell, Lass, To ding the Painter and his Piece. The LURE: A Tale. The Sun just o'er the Hills was peeping, The Hynds arising, Gentry sleeping, The Dogs were barking, Cocks were crawing, Night-drinking Sots counting their Lawing; Clean were the Roads, and clear the Day, When forth a Falconer took his Way, Nane with him but his she Knight errant, That acts in Air the bloody Tyrant; While with quick Wing, fierce Beek and Claws, She breaks divine and humane Laws; Ne'er pleas'd, but with the Hearts and Livers Of Peartricks, Teals, Moor-powts and Plivers; Yet is she much esteem'd and dandl'd, Clean lodg'd, well fed, and saftly handl'd. Reason for this need be nae Wonder, Her Parasites share in the Plunder. Thus sneaking Rooks about a Court, That make Oppression but their Sport, Will praise a paughty bloody King, And hire mean Hackney-Poets to sing His Glories; while the Deel be licket He e'er attempt but what he sticket. So, Sir, as I was gawn to say, This Falconer had tane his Way O'er Calder-moor; and gawn the Moss up, He there forgather'd with a Gossip: And wha was't, trow ye, but the Deel, That had disguis'd himsell sae weel In humane Shape, sae snug and wylie; Jude took him for a Burrlie-baillie: His cloven Cloots were hid with Shoon, A Bonnet coor'd his Horns aboon: Nor spat he Fire, or Brimstone rifted, Nor awsome glowr'd; but cawmly lifted His Een and Voice, and thus began, Good Morning t'ye, honest Man, Ye're early out:—How far gae ye This Gate?—I'm blyth of Company— What Fowl is that, may ane demand, That stands sae trigly on your Hand? “Wow Man! quoth Juden, where won ye? “The like was never speer'd at me! “Man, 'tis a Hawk, and e'en as good “As ever flew, or wore a Hood.” Friend, I'm a Stranger, quoth auld Symmie, I hope ye'll no be angry wi' me; The Ignorant maun ay be speering Questions, till they come to a Clearing. Then tell me mair—What do ye wi't? Is't good to sing? or good to eat? “For neither, answer'd simple Juden; “But helps to bring my Lord his Food in: “When Fowls start up that I wad hae, “Straight frae my Hand I let her gae; “Her Hood tane aff, she is not langsome “In taking Captives, which I ransome “With a Dow's Wing, or Chicken's leg.” Trowth, quoth the Deel, that's nice! I beg Ye'll be sae kind, as let me see How this same Bird of yours can flee. “T'oblige ye, Friend, I winna stand.“— Syne loos'd the Falcon frae his Hand. Unhooded, up she sprang with Birr, While baith stood staring after her. But how d'ye get her back? said Nick. “For that, quoth Jude, I have a Trick. “Ye see this Lure,—it shall command “Her upon Sight down to my Hand.” Syne twirl'd it thrice, with whieu-whieu-whieu— And straight upon't the Falcon flew. As I'm a Sinner! crys the Deel, I like this Pastime wonder weel; And since ye've been sae kindly free, To let her at my Bidding flee, I'll entertain ye in my Gate.— Mean time it was the Will of Fate, A hooded Friar (ane of that Clan Ye have descriv'd by Father The reverend Anthony Gawin, formerly a Spanish Roman Catholick Priest, now an Irish Protestant Minister, who hath lately wrote three Volumes on the Tricks and Whoredoms of the Priests and Nuns; which Book he names Master-keys to Popery. Gawin, In Master-keys) came up; good Saul! Him Satan cleek'd up by the Spaul, Whip'd aff his Hood, and without mair, Ga'e him a Toss up in the Air. High flew the Son of Saint Loyola, While startled Juden gave a Hola! Bumbaz'd with Wonder, still he stood, The Ferly had 'maist crudled his Blood, To see a Monk mount like a Facon, He 'gan to doubt if he was wakin: Thrice did he rub his Een to clear; And having master'd part o's Fear, “His Presence be about us a'! “He cries, the like I never saw: “See, see! he like a Lavrock tours— “He'll reek the Starns in twa 'r three Hours! “Is't possible to bring him back?” For that, quoth Nick, I have a Knack; To train my Birds, I want na Lures, Can manage them as ye do your's: And there's ane coming, hie gate, hither, Shall soon bring down the haly Brither. This was a fresh young Landwart Lass, With Cheeks like Cherries, Een like Glass; Few Coats she wore, and they were kilted, And (John come kiss me now) she lilted. As she skift o'er the Benty Knows, Gawn to the Bught to milk the Ews; Her in his Hand slee Belzie hint up, As eith as ye wad do a Pint-Stoup, Inverted, wav'd her round his Head: Whieu,—whieu,—he whistled, and with Speed Down, quick as shooting Starns, the Priest Came souse upon the Lass's Breast. The Moral of this Tale shews plainly That carnal Minds attempt but vainly Aboon this laigher Warld to mount, While Slaves to Satan. An Anacreontique on Love. When a' the Warld had clos'd their Een, Fatigu'd with Labour, Care and Din, And quietly ilka weary Wight Enjoy'd the Silence of the Night: Then Cupid, that ill-deedy Get, With a' his Pith rapt at my Yet. Surpriz'd, throw Sleep, I cry'd, Wha's that? Quoth he, A poor young Wean a' wet; Oh! haste ye apen,—fear nae Skaith, Else soon this Storm will be my Death. With his Complaint my Saul grew wae, For as he said I thought it sae; I took a Light, and fast did rin To let the chittering Infant in: And he appear'd to be nae Kow, For a' his Quiver, Wings and Bow. His bairnly Smiles and Looks gave Joy, He seem'd sae innocent a Boy: I led him ben but any Pingle, And beekt him brawly at my Ingle; Dighted his Face, his Handies thow'd, 'Till his young Cheeks, like Roses, glow'd. But soon as he grew warm and fain, Let's try, quoth he, if that the Rain Has wrang'd ought of my sporting Gear, And if my Bow-string's hale and fier. With that his Arch'ry Graith he put In order, and made me his Butt; Mov'd back apiece,—his Bow he drew; Fast throw my Breast his Arrow flew. That done, as if he'd found a Nest, He leugh, and with unsonsy Jest, Cry'd, Nibour, I'm right blyth in Mind, That in good Tift my Bow I find: Did not my Arrow flie right smart? Ye'll find it sticking in your Heart. On Mr. Drummond's being chosen one of the Honourable Commissioners of the Customs; An Epigram. The Good are glad, when Merit meets Reward; And thus they share the Pleasure of another, While little Minds, who only self regard, Will sicken at the Success of a Brother. Hence I am pleas'd to find my self right class'd, Even by this Mark, that's worthy of observing, It gives me Joy, the Patent lately pass'd In Favour of dear DRUMMOND, most deserving. The Address of the MUSE, To the Right Honourable George Drummond Esq; Lord Provost; and Council of Edinburgh. My Lord, my Patron, good and kind, Whose every Act of generous Care The Patriot shews, and trusty Friend; While Favours by your Thoughts refin'd, Both Publick and the Private share. To you the Muse her duteous Homage pays, While Edinburgh's Interest animates her Lays. Nor will the Best some Hints refuse: The narrow Soul, that least brings forth, To an Advice the rarest bows; Which the extensive Mind allows, Being conscious of its genuine Worth, Fears no Eclipse; nor with dark Pride declines, A Ray from Light, that far inferior shines. Our Reason and Advantage call Us to preserve what we esteem; And each should contribute, tho' small, Like Silver Rivulets that fall In one, and make a spreading Stream. So should a City all her Care unite, T'engage with Entertainments of Delight. Man for Society was made, His Search of Knowledge has no Bound; Through the vast Deep he loves to wade, But Subjects ebb, and Spirits fade, On Wilds and thinly peopl'd Ground. Then where the World, in Minature, employs Its various Arts, the Soul its Wish enjoys. Sometimes the social Mind may rove, And trace, with Contemplation high, The natural Beauties of the Grove, Pleas'd with the Turtle's making Love, While Birds chant in a Summer Sky. But when cold Winter snows the naked Fields, The City then its changing Pleasure yields. Then you, to whom pertains the Care, And have the Power to act aright, Nor Pains, nor prudent Judging spare, The Good Town's Failings to repair, And give her Lovers more Delight. Much you have done, both useful and polite; O never tire! till every Plan's complete. Some may object, We Money want, Of every Project Soul and Nerve. 'Tis true;—but sure, the Parliament Will ne'er refuse frankly to grant Such Funds as good Designs deserve. The thriving well of each of Britain's Towns, Adds to her Wealth, and more her Grandeur crowns. Allow that fifteen thousand Pounds Were yearly on Improvements spent; If Luxury produce the Funds, And well laid out, there are no Grounds For murmuring, or the least Complaint: Materials all within our native Coast, The Poor's employ'd, we gain, and nothing's lost. Two hundreds, for five Pounds a day, Will work like Turkish Galey Slaves; And, e'er they sleep, they will repay Back all the Publick forth did lay, For small Support that Nature craves. Thus kept at Work, few Twangs of Guilt they feel, And are not tempt' by pinching Want to steal. Most wisely did our City move, When Mr. Hope of Rankeilour, who has beautifully planted, hedged and drained Straiton's Meadow, which was formerly the Bottom of a Lake. HOPE, who judges well and nice, Was chosen fittest to improve, From rushy Tufts the pleasing Grove, From Bogs a rising Paradise. Since Earth's Foundation, to our present Day, The beauteous Plain in Mud neglected lay. Now, evenly planted, hedg'd and drain'd, Its Verdures please the Scent and Sight; And here the Fair may walk unpain'd, Her flowing Silks and Shoes unstain'd, Round the green Circus of Delight: Which shall by ripening Time still sweeter grow, And HOPE be fam'd while Scotsmen draw the Bow. Ah! while I sing, the Northern Air, Throu' Gore and Carnage gives Offence; Which should not, while a River fair, Without our Walls flows by so near; Carriage from thence but small Expence: The useful Corporation too would find, By working there, more Health, and Ease of Mind. Then sweet our Northern Flowers would blow, And sweet our Northern Alleys end: Sweet all the Northern Springs would flow, Sweet No(r)thern Trees and Herbs would grow, And from the Lake a Field be gain'd: Where on the Springs green Margent by the Dawn, Our Maids might wash, and blanch their Lace and Lawn. With the more Freedom some Thoughts in these Stanza's are advanced, because several Citizens of the best thinking, both in and out of the Magistracy, incline to, and have such Views, if they were not oppos'd by some of gross old fashion'd Notions. Such will tell you, O! the Street of Edinburgh is the finest Garden of Scotland. And how can it otherwise be, considering how well 'tis dung'd every Night? But this Abuse we hope to see reform'd soon, when the Cart and Warning Bell shall leave the lazy Slatern without Excuse, after Ten at Night. Forbid a nasty Pack to place On Stalls unclean their Herbs and Roots, On the High-street a vile Disgrace, And tempting to our Infant-race, To swallow Poison with their Fruits. Give them a Station, where less spoil'd and seen, The healthful Herbage may keep fresh and clean. Besides, they straiten much our Street, When those who drive the Hack and Dray, In drunk and rude Confusion meet, We know not where to turn our Feet; Mortal our Hazard every Way. Too oft the Ag'd, the Deaf and little Fry, Hem'd in with Stalls, crush'd under Axles ly. Clean Order yields a vast Delight, And Genius's that brightest shine, Prefer the Pleasure of the Sight Justly, to theirs who Day and Night Sink Health and active Thought in Wine. Happy the Man that's clean in House and Weed, Tho' Water be his Drink, and Oats his Bread. Kind Fate, on them whom I admire Bestow neat Rooms and Gardens fair, Pictures that speak the Painter's Fire, And Learning which the Nine inspire, With Friends that all his Thoughts may share; A House in Edinburgh, when the sullen Storm Defaces Nature's joyous fragrant Form. O! may we hope to see a Stage, Fill'd with the best of such as can Smile down the Follies of the Age, Correct dull Pride and Party-rage, And cultivate the growing Man; And shew the Virgin every proper Grace, That makes her Mind as comely as her Face. Nor will the most devout oppose, When with a strict judicious Care, The Scenes most vertuous shall be chose, That numerous are, forbidding those That shock the Modest, Good and Fair. The best of things may often be abus'd; That argues not, when right, to be refus'd. Thus, what our Fathers wasting Blood, Of old from the South Britons won, When Scotland reach'd to Humber's Flood, We shall regain by Arts less rude, And bring the Best and Fairest down, From England's Northern Counties, nigh as far Distant from Court, as we of Pictland are. Thus far inspir'd with honest Zeal, These Thoughts are offer'd with Submission, By your own Bard, who ne'er shall fail The Interest of the Common-weal; While you indulge and grant Permission To your oblig'd, thus humbly to rehearse His honest and well-meaning Thoughts in Verse. On his Grace the Duke of Hamilton's shooting an Arrow through the Neck of an Eel. As from a Bow a fatal Flane, Train'd by Apollo from the Main, In Water pierc'd an Eel; Sae may the Patriot's Power and Art, Sic Fate to souple Rogues impart, That drumble the Common-weal. Tho' they, as ony Eels, are slid, And thro' what's vile can scud, A Bolt may reach them, tho' deep hid, They sculk beneath their Mud. Betty and Kate; A Pastoral Farewell to Mr. Aikman, when he went for London. BETTY. Dear Katie, Willy's e'en away! Willy, of Herds the wale, To feed his Flock, and make his Hay Upon a distant Dale, Far to the Southward of this Height Where now we dowie stray; Ay hartsome when he chear'd our Sight, And leugh with us a' Day. KATE. O Willy can Dale Dainties please Thee mair than Moorland Ream; Does Isis flow with sweeter Ease Than Fortha's gentle Stream? Or takes thou rather mair Delyt In the Strae-hatted Maid, Than in the blooming red and whyt Of her that wears the Plaid? BETTY. Na, Kate, for that we needna mourn, He is not gi'en to Change; But Sauls of sic a shining Turn, For Honour's like to range: Our Laird, and a' the Gentry round, Who mauna be said nay, Sic Pleasure in his Art have found, They winna let him stay. Blyth I have stood frae Morn to Een, To see how true and weel He could delyt us on the Green With a piece Cawk and Keel, On a slid Stane, or smoother Slate, He can the Picture draw Of you or me, or Sheep or Gait, The likest e'er ye saw. Lass thinkna Shame to ease your Mind, I see ye're like to greet; Let gae these Tears, 'tis justly kind, For Shepherd sae complete. KATE. Far, far! o'er far frae Spey and Clyde, Stands that great Town of Lud, To whilk our best Lads rin and ride; That's like to put us wood: For sindle times they e'er come back, Wha anes are heftit there. Sure Bess their Hills are no sae black, Nor yet their Howms sae bare. BETTY. Our Riggs are rich, and green our Heights, And well our Cares reward; But yield, nae doubt, far less Delights, In Absence of our Laird. But we maun cawmly now submit, And our ill Luck lament, And leave't to his ain Sense and Wit To find his Heart's Content. A thousand Gates he had to win The Love of auld and young, Did a' he did with little Din; And in nae Deed was dung. KATE. WILLIAM and MARY never fail'd To welcome with a Smile, And hearten us, when ought we ail'd, Without designing Guile. Lang may she happily possess Wha's in his Breast infeft, And may their bonny Bairns increase, And a' with Rowth be left. O William win your Laurels fast, And syne we'll a' be fain, Soon as your wandring Days are past, And you're return'd again. BETTY. Revive her Joys by your Return, To whom you first gave Pain; Judge how her Passions for you burn, By these you bear your ain. Sae may your Kirn with Fatness flow, And a' your Ky be sleek; And may your Heart with Gladness glow, In finding what ye seek. To Mr. David Malloch, On his Departure from Scotland. Since Fate, with Honour, bids thee leave Thy Country for a while, It is nae friendly Part to grieve, When Powers propitious smile. The Task assign'd thee's great and good, To cultivate two GRAHAMS, Wha from bauld Heroes draw their Blood Of brave immortal Names. Like Wax the dawning Genius takes Impressions, thrawin or even; Then he wha fair the Molding makes, Does Journey-work for Heaven. The sowr weak Pedants spoil the Mind Of those beneath their Care, Who think Instruction is confin'd To poor Grammatick Ware. But better kens my Friend, and can Far nobler Plans design, To lead the Boy up to a Man That's fit in Courts to shine. Frae Grampian Heights, some may object, Can you sic Knowledge bring? But those laigh Thinkers ne'er reflect, Some Sauls ken ilka thing With vaster Ease at the first Glance, Than misty Minds that plod And thresh for Thought, but ne'er advance Their Stawk aboon their Clod. But he William and Margaret, a Ballad in Imitation of the old Manner, wherein the Strength of Thought and Passion is more observed than a Rant of unmeaning Words. that could in tender Strains Raise Margaret's plaining Shade, And paint Distress that chills the Veins, While William's Crimes are red; Shaws to the World, cou'd they observe, A clear deserving Flame— Thus I can roose without Reserve, When Truth supports my Theme.

Here lyes a Man, whose upright Heart With Vertue was profusely stor'd, Who acted well the honest Part Between the Tenants and their Lord. Between the Sands and flinty Rock Thus steer'd he in the Golden Mean, While his blyth Countenance bespoke A Mind unruffl'd and serene. As to great BRUCE the FLEMINGS prov'd Faithful, so to the FLEMINGS Heir WARDLAW behav'd, and was belov'd For's Justice, Candor, Faith and Care. His Merit shall preserve his Fame To latest Ages, free from Rust, 'Till the Arch-Angel raise his Frame To join his Soul amongst the Just. AN ODE Sacred to the Memory of her Grace Anne Dutchess of Hamilton. Why sounds the Plain with sad Complaint? Why hides the Sun his Beams? Why sigh the Winds sae bleak and cauld? Why mourn the swelling Streams? Wail on, ye Heights; ye Glens, complain; Sun, wear thy cloudy Veil: Sigh, Winds, frae frozen Caves of Snaw; Clyde, mourn the rueful Tale. She's dead, the beauteous ANNA's dead; All Nature wears a Gloom: Alas! the comely budding Flower, Is faded in the Bloom. Clos'd in the weeping Marble Vault, Now cauld and blae she lies; Nae mair the Smiles adorn her Cheek, Nae mair she lifts her Eyes. Too soon, O sweetest, fairest, best, Young Parent, lovely Mate, Thou leaves thy Lord and Infant Son, To weep thy early Fate. But late thy chearfu' Marriage-day, Gave Gladness all around; But late in thee, the youthful Chief A Heaven of Blessings found. His Bosom swells, for much he lov'd; Words fail to paint his Grief: He starts in Dream, and grasps thy Shade, The Day brings nae Relief. The fair Illusion skims away, And Grief again returns; Life's Pleasures make a vain Attempt, Disconsolate he mourns. He mourns his Loss, a Nations Loss, It claims a Flood of Tears, When sic a lov'd illustrious Star Sae quickly disappears. With Roses and the Lilly Buds, Ye Nymphs, her Grave adorn, And weeping tell, Thus sweet she was, Thus early from us torn. To silent twilight Shades retire, Ye melancholy Swains, In melting Notes repete her Praise, In sighing vent your Pains. But haste, calm Reason, to our Aid, And paining Thoughts subdue, By placing of the pious Fair In a mair pleasing View: Whose white immortal Mind now shines, And shall for ever bright, Above th'Insult of Death and Pain, By the first Spring of Light. There joins the high melodious Thrang, That strike eternal Strings: In Presence of Omnipotence, She now a Seraph sings. Then cease, Great JAMES, thy flowing Tears, Nor rent thy Soul in vain: Frae bowers of Bliss she'll ne'er return To thy kind Arms again, With Goodness still adorn thy Mind, True Greatness still improve; Be still a Patriot just and brave, And meet thy Saint above. ODE To the Memory of Sir ISAAC NEWTON; Inscrib'd to the Royal Society of London for the Improving of Natural Knowledge. Great NEWTON's dead,—full ripe his Fame; Cease, vulgar Grief, to cloud our Song: We thank the Author of our Frame, Who lent him to the Earth so long. The God-like Man now mounts the Sky, Exploring all yon radiant Spheres; And with one View can more descry, Than here below in eighty Years: Tho' none, with greater Strength of Soul, Could rise to more divine a Height, Or range the Orbs from Pole to Pole, And more improve the humane Sight. Now with full Joy he can survey These Worlds, and ev'ry shining Blaze, That countless in the Milky Way, Only thro' Glasses shew their Rays. Thousands in thousand Arts excell'd, But often to one Part confin'd; While ev'ry Science stood reveal'd And clear to his capacious Mind. His Penetration, most profound, Launch'd far in that extended Sea, Where humane Minds can reach no Bound, And never div'd so deep as he. Sons of the East and Western World, When on this Leading Star ye gaze, While Magnets guide the Sail unfurl'd, Pay to his Memory due Praise. Thro' ev'ry Maze he was the Guide; While others crawl'd, he soar'd above: Yet Modesty, unstain'd with Pride, Increas'd his Merit, and our Love. He shunn'd the Sophistry of Words, Which only hatch contentious Spite; His Learning turn'd on what affords By Demonstration most Delight. Britain may honourably boast, And glory in her matchless Son, Whose Genius has invented most, And finish'd what the rest begun. Ye Fellows of the Royal Class, Who honour'd him to be your Head, Erect in finest Stone and Brass Statues of the Illustrious Dead. Altho' more lasting than them all, Or ev'n the Poet's highest Strain, His Works, as long as wheels this Ball, Shall his great Memory sustain. May from your Learned Band arise Newtons to shine thro' future Times, And bring down Knowledge from the Skies, To plant on wild Barbarian Climes. 'Till Nations, few Degrees from Brutes, Be brought into each proper Road, Which leads to Wisdom's happiest Fruits, To know their Saviour and their God. To William Somerville of Warwickshire Esq; on reading several of his excellent Poems. Sir, I have read, and much admire Your Muse's gay and easy Flow, Warm'd with that true Idalian Fire That gives the bright and chearful Glow. I con'd each Line with joyous Care, As I can such from Sun to Sun; And like the Glutton o'er his Fare Delicious, thought them too soon done. The witty Smile, Nature and Art, In all your Numbers so combine, As to complete their just Desert, And grace them with uncommon Shine. Delighted we your Muse regard, When she like Pindar's spreads her Wings; And Vertue being its own Reward, Expresses by the Sister Springs. Emotions tender croud the Mind, When with the Royal Bard you go, To sigh in Notes divinely kind, The Mighty faln on Mount Gilbo. Much surely was the Virgin's Joy, Who with the Iliad had your Lays; For e'er, and since the Siege of Troy We all delight in Love and Praise. These Heaven-born Passions, such desire, I never yet cou'd think a Crime; But first-rate Vertues which inspire The Soul to reach at the Sublime. But often Men mistake the Way, And pump for Fame by empty Boast, Like your gilt Ass, who stood to bray, Till in a Flame his Tail he lost. Him th'incurious Bencher hits, With his own Tale, so tight and clean, That while I read, Streams gush, by Fits Of hearty Laughter, from my Een. Old Chaucer, Bard of vast Ingine, Fontain and Prior, who have sung Blyth Tales the best; had they heard thine On Lob, they'd own'd themselves out-done. The Plot's pursu'd with so much Glee, The too officious Dog and Priest, The 'Squire oppress'd, I own, for me, I never heard a better Jest. POPE well describ'd an Omber Game, And King revenging Captive Queen; He merits; but had won more Fame, If Author of your Bowling-Green. You paint your Parties, play each Bowl, So natural, just, and with such Ease, That while I read, upon my Soul! I wonder how I chance to please. Yet I have pleas'd, and please the best; And sure to me Laurels belong, Since British Fair, and 'mongst the best, Somervile's Consort likes my Song. Ravish'd I heard th'harmonious Fair Sing, like a Dweller of the Sky, My Verses with a Scotian Air; Then Saints were not so blest as I. In her the valu'd Charms unite; She really is what all would seem, Gracefully handsome, wise and sweet: 'Tis Merit to have her Esteem. Your noble Kinsman her lov'd Mate, Whose Worth claims all the World['s] Respect, Met in her Love a smiling Fate, Which has, and must have good Effect. You both from one great Lineage spring, Both from de Somervile, who came, With William England's conquering King, To win fair Plains, and lasting Fame. WHICHNOUR he left to's eldest Son; That first-born Chief you represent: His second came to Caledon, From whom our SOMER'LE takes Descent. On Him and You may Fate bestow Sweet balmy Health and cheerful Fire, As long's ye'd wish to live below, Still blest with all you wou'd desire. O Sir! oblige the World, and spread In Print Since the writing of this Ode, Mr. Somervile's Poems are printed by Mr. Lintot in an 8vo Vol. those and your other Lays; This (shall be better'd while they read) And after Ages sound your Praise. I cou'd enlarge—but if I shou'd On what you've wrote, my Ode wou'd run Too great a length—Your Thoughts so croud, To note them all, I'd ne'er have done. Accept this Offering of a Muse, Who on her Pictland Hills ne'er tires; Nor shou'd (when Worth invites) refuse To sing the Person she admires. AN EPISTLE From Mr. Somervile. Near fair Avona's Silver Tide, Whose Waves in soft Meanders glide, I read, to the delighted Swains, Your jocund Songs, and rural Strains. Smooth as her Streams your Numbers flow, Your Thoughts in vary'd Beauties show, Like Flow'rs that on her Borders grow. While I survey, with ravish'd Eyes, This Lord Somervile was pleased to send me his own Picture, and Mr. Ramsay's Works. friendly Gift, my valu'd Prize, Where Sister Arts, with Charms divine, In their full Bloom and Beauty shine, Alternately my Soul is blest. Now I behold my welcome Guest, That graceful, that engaging Air, So dear to all the Brave and Fair. Nor has th'ingenious Artist shown His outward Lineaments alone, But in th'expressive Draught design'd, The nobler Beauties of his Mind; True Friendship, Love, Benevolence, Unstudied Wit, and manly Sense. Then, as your Book, I wander o'er, And feast on the delicious Store, (Like the laborious busy Bee, Pleas'd with the sweet Variety) With equal Wonder and Surprize, I see resembling Portraits rise. Brave Archers march in bright Aray, In Troups the vulgar line the Way. Here the droll Figures slily sneer, Or Coxcombs at full length appear. There Woods and Lawns, a rural Scene, And Swains that gambol on the Green. Your Pen can act the Pencil's Part With greater Genius, Fire and Art. Believe me, Bard, no hunted Hind That pants against the Southern Wind, And seeks the Stream thro' unknown Ways; No Matron in her teeming Days, E'er felt such Longings, such Desires, As I to view those lofty Spires, Those Domes, where fair Edina shrouds Her tow'ring Head amid the Clouds. But oh! what Dangers interpose? Vales deep with Dirt, and Hills with Snows, Proud Winter-Floods with rapid Force, Forbid the pleasing Intercourse. But sure we Bards whose purer Clay, Nature has mixt with less Allay, Might soon find out an easier Way. Do not sage Matrons mount on high, And switch their Broom-sticks thro' the Sky; Ride post o'er Hills, and Woods, and Seas, From Thule to th' The Scilly Islands were so called by the Antients, as Mr. Camden observes. Hesperides? And yet the Men of Gresham own That this and stranger Feats are done, By a warm Fancy's Power alone. This granted; Why can't you and I Stretch forth our Wings, and cleave the Sky? Since our Poetick Brains, you know, Than theirs must more intensely glow. Did not the Theban Swan take Wing, Sublimely soar, and sweetly sing? And do not we of humbler Vein, Sometimes attempt a loftier Strain, Mount sheer out of the Reader's Sight, Obscurely lost in Clouds and Night? Then climb your Pegasus with Speed, I'll meet thee on the Banks of Tweed: Not as our Fathers did of Yore, To swell the Flood with Crimson Gore; Like the Cadmean murd'ring Brood, Each thirsting for his Brother's Blood. For now all hostile Rage shall cease; Lull'd in the downy Arms of Peace, Our honest Hands and Hearts shall join, O'er jovial Banquets, sparkling Wine. Let Peggy at thy Elbow wait, And I shall bring my bonny Kate. But hold—Oh! take a special Care, T'admit no prying Kirkman there; I dread the Penitential Chair. What a strange Figure shou'd I make, A poor abandon'd English Rake; A Squire well-born, and six Foot high, Perch'd in that sacred Pillory? Let Spleen and Zeal be banish'd thence, And troublesome Impertinence, That tells his Story o'er again: Ill Manners and his saucy Train, And Self conceit, and stiff-rumpt Pride, That grin at all the World beside; Foul Scandal, with a Load of Lies, Intrigues, Rencounters, Prodigies; Fame's busy Hawker, light as Air, That feeds on Frailties of the Fair: Envy, Hypocrisy, Deceit, Fierce Party-Rage, and warm Debate; And all the Hell-hounds that are Foes To Friendship, and the World's Repose. But Mirth instead, and dimpling Smiles, And Wit, that gloomy Care beguiles; And Joke, and Pun, and merry Tale, And Toasts, that round the Table sail: While Laughter, bursting thro' the Crowd In Vollies, tells our Joys aloud. Hark! the shrill Piper mounts on high, The Woods, the Streams, the Rocks reply, To his far-sounding Melody. Behold each lab'ring Squeeze prepare Supplies of modulated Air. Observe Croudero's active Bow, His Head still noddling to and fro, His Eyes, his Cheeks with Raptures glow. See, see the bashful Nymphs advance, To lead the regulated Dance; Flying still, the Swains pursuing, Yet with backward Glances wooing. This, this shall be the joyous Scene; Nor wanton Elves that skim the Green Shall be so blest, so blyth, so gay, Or less regard what Dotards say. My Rose shall then your Thistle greet, The Union shall be more compleat; And, in a Bottle and a Friend, Each National Dispute shall end. Answer to the above Epistle From William Somervile Esq; of Warwickshire. Sir, I had your's, and own my Pleasure, On the Receipt, exceeded Measure. You write with so much Sp'rit and Glee, Sae smooth, sae strong, correct and free; That any He (by you allow'd To have some Merit) may be proud. If that's my Fault, bear you the Blame, Wha've lent me sic a Lift to Fame. Your ain tours high, and widens far, Bright glancing like a first-rate Star, And all the World bestow due Praise On the Collection of your Lays; Where various Arts and Turns combine, Which even in Parts first Poets shine: Like Mat and Swift ye sing with Ease, And can be Waller when you please. Continue, Sir, and shame the Crew That's plagued with having nought to do, Who Fortune in a merry Mood Has overcharg'd with gentle Blood, But has deny'd a Genius fit For Action or aspiring Wit; Such kenna how t'employ their Time, And think Activity a Crime: Aught they to either do, or say, Or walk, or write, or read, or pray! When Money, their Factotum's able To furnish them a numerous Rabble, Who will, for daily Drink and Wages, Be Chair-men, Chaplains, Clerks, and Pages: Could they, like you, employ their Hours In planting these delightful Flowers, Which carpet the Poetick Fields, And lasting Funds of Pleasure yields; Nae mair they'd gaunt and gove away, Or sleep or loiter out the Day, Or waste the Night damning their Sauls In deep Debauch, and bawdy Brawls: Whence Pox and Poverty proceed An early Eild, and Spirits dead. Reverse of You;—and Him you Love, Whose brighter Spirit tours above The Mob of thoughtless Lords and Beaus, Who in his ilka Action shows True Friendship, Love, Benevolence, Unstudy'd Wit, and manly Sense. Allow here what you've said your sell, Nought can b' exprest, so just and well: To Him and Her, worthy his Love, And every Blessing from above, A Son is given, GOD save the Boy, For theirs and every Som'ril's Joy. Ye Wardins round him take your Place, And raise him with each manly Grace; Make his Meridian Vertues shine, To add fresh Lustres to his Line: And many may the Mother see Of such a lovely Progeny. Now, Sir, when Boreas nae mair thuds Hail, Snaw and Sleet, frae blacken'd Clouds; While Caledonia's Hills are green, And a' her Straths delight the Een; While ilka Flower with Fragrance blows, And a' the Year it's Beauty shows; Before again the Winter lour, What hinders then your No[r]thern Tour? Be sure of Welcome: Nor believe These wha an ill Report would give To Ed'nburgh and the Land of Cakes, That nought what's necessary lacks. Here Plenty's Goddess frae her Horn Pours Fish and Cattle, Claith and Corn, In blyth Abundance;—and yet mair, Our Men are brave, our Ladies fair. Nor will North Britain yield for Fouth Of ilka thing, and Fellows couth, To any but her Sister South.— True, rugged Roads are cursed driegh, And Speats aft roar frae Mountains high: The Body tires,—poor tottering Clay, And likes with Ease at hame to stay; While Sauls stride Warlds at ilka Stend, And can their widening Views extend. Mine sees you, while you chearfu' roam On sweet Avona's flow'ry Howm, There recollecting, with full View, These Follies which Mankind pursue; While, conscious of superior Merit, You rise with a correcting Spirit; And, as an Agent of the Gods, Lash them with sharp satyrick Roads: Labour divine!—Next, for a Change, O'er Hill and Dale I see you range, After the Fox or whidding Hare, Confirming Health in purest Air; While Joy frae Heights and Dales resounds, Rais'd by the Hola, Horn and Hounds: Fatigu'd, yet pleas'd, the Chace out-run, I see the Friend, and setting Sun, Invite you to the temp'rate Bicquor, Which makes the Blood and Wit flow quicker. The Clock strikes Twelve, to Rest you bound, To save your Health by sleeping sound. Thus with cool Head and healsome Breast You see new Day stream frae the East: Then all the Muses round you shine, Inspiring every Thought divine; Be long their Aid—Your Years and Blesses, Your Servant ALLAN RAMSAY wishes. REASONS for not answering the Hackney Scribblers, my obscure Enemies. These to my blyth indulgent Friends; Dull Faes nought at my Hand deserve: To pump an Answer's a' their Ends; But not ae Line, if they shou'd starve. Wha e'er shall with a Midding fight, Of Victory will be beguild; Dealers in Dirt will be to dight, Fa' they aboon or 'neath, they're fil'd. It helps my Character to heez, When I'm the Butt of creeping Tools; The Warld, by their daft Medley, sees, That I've nae Enemies but Fools, But sae it has been, and will be, While real Poets rise to Fame, Sic poor Macflecknos will let flee Their Venom, and still miss their Aim. Should ane like Young or Somer'le write, Some canker'd Coof can say 'tis wrang: On Pope sic Mungrels shaw'd their Spite; And shot at Addison their Stang. But well dear Spec the feckless Asses To wiest Insects even'd and painted, Sic as by magnifying Glasses Are only kend when throu' them tented. The blundering Fellows ne'er foryet, About my Trade to f?their Fancies, As if, forsooth, I wad look blate At what my Honour maist advances. Auld Homer sang for's daily Bread; Surprising Shakspear fin'd the Wool; Great Virgil Creels and Baskets made; And famous Ben employ'd the Trowel. Yet Dorset, Launsdown, Lauderdale, Bucks, Stirling, and the Son of Angus, Even Monarchs, and of Men the Wale, Were proud to be inrow'd amang us. Then Hackneys, write till ye gae wood, Drudge for the Hawkers Day and Night; Your Malice cannot move my Mood, And equally your Praise I slight. I've gotten mair of Fame than's due, Which is secur'd amang the best; And shou'd I tent the like of you, A little Saul wad be confest. Nae Mastive minds a yamphing Cur; A Craig defies a frothy Wave; Nor will a Lyon raise his Fur, Altho' a Monkey misbehave. Nam satis est Equitem mihi plaudere. To Mr. DONALD MACEWEN Jeweller at St. Petersburg. How far frae hame my Friend seeks Fame! And yet I canna wyte ye, T'employ your Fire, and still aspire, By Vertues that delyte ye. Should Fortune lour, 'tis in your Power, If Heaven grant bawmy Health, T'enjoy ilk Hour a Saul unsowr; Content's nae Bairn of Wealth. It is the Mind that's not confin'd To Passions mean and vile, That's never pin'd, while Thoughts refin'd Can gloomy Cares beguile. Then Donald may be e'en as gay, On Russia's distant Shore, As on the Tay, where Usquebae He us'd to drink before. But howsoe'er, haste, gather Gear, And syne pack up your Treasure; Then to Auld Reekie come, and beek ye, And close your Days with Pleasure. To the same [Mr. Donald Macewen], on receiving a Present from him of a Seal, Homer's Head finely cut in Crystal, and set in Gold. Thanks to my frank ingenious Friend; Your Present's most gentile and kind, Baith rich and shining as your Mind; And that immortal laurell'd Pow, Upon the Gem sae well design'd And execute, sets me on Low. The heavenly Fire inflames my Breast, Whilst I unweary'd am in quest Of Fame, and hope that Ages niest Will do their Highland Bard the Grace, Upon their Seals to cut his Crest, And blythest Strakes of his short Face. Far less great Homer ever thought (When he, harmonious Beggar! sought His bread throu' Greece) he should be brought, Frae Russia's Shore by Captain Captain Hugh Eccles, Master of a fine Merchant Ship, which he lost in the unhappy Fire at Petersburg. Hugh, To Pictland Plains, sae finely wrought On precious Stone, and set by you. A Ballad on bonny Kate. Cease, Poets, your cunning devising Of Rhimes that low Beauties o'er-rate; They all, like the Stars at the rising Of Phœbus, must yield to fair KATE. We sing, and we think it our Duty To admire the kind Blessings of Fate That has favour'd the Earth with such Beauty, As shines so divinely in KATE. In her Smiles, in her Features and Glances, The Graces shine forth in full State, While the God of Love dangerously dances On the Neck and white Bosom of KATE. How straight, how well-turn'd, and gentile, are Her Limbs! and how graceful her Gait! Their Hearts made of Stone, or of Steel are, That are not Adorers of KATE. But ah! what a sad Palpatation Feels the Heart, and how simple and blate Must he look, almost dead with Vexation, Whose Love is fixt hopeless on KATE? Had I all the Charms of Adonis, And Galleons freighted with Plate, As SOLOMON wise; I'd think none is So worthy of all, as dear KATE. Ah! had she for me the same Passion, I'd tune the Lyre early and late; The Sage's Song on his Circasian, Should yield to my Sonnets on KATE. His Pleasure each Moment shall blossom, Unfading, gets her for his Mate; He'll grasp every Bliss in his Bosom, That's linked by Hymen to KATE. Pale Envy may raise up false Stories, And Hell may promp Malice and Hate; But nothing shall sully their Glories, Who are shielded with Vertue like KATE. This Name, say ye, many a Lass has, And t'apply it may raise a Debate; But sure he as dull as an Ass is, That cannot join COCHRAN to KATE. To Dr. J. C. who got the foregoing to give to the young Lady. Here, happy Doctor, take this Sonnet, Bear to the Fair the faithful Strains: Bow, make a Leg, and d'off your Bonnet; And get a Kiss, for ALLAN's Pains. For such a ravishing Reward, The Cloud Compeller's self would try To imitate a British Bard, And bear his Ballads from the Sky. PROLOGUE, before the acting of Aurenzebe and the Drummer, by the young Gentlemen of the Grammar School of Haddington, August 1727, spoke by Mr. Charles Cockburn, Son to Colonel Cockburn. Be hush, ye Crowd, who pressing round appear Only to stare—we speak to those can hear The nervous Phrase, which raises Thoughts more hy, When added Action leads them thro' the Eye. To paint fair Vertue, Humours and Mistakes, Is what our School with Pleasure undertakes, Thro' various Incidents of Life, led on By DRYDEN, and immortal ADDISON: Those study'd Men, and knew the various Springs That mov'd the Minds of Coachmen and of Kings. Altho' we're young—allow no Thought so mean, That any here's to act the Harlequin: We leave such dumb-show Mimickry to Fools, Beneath the Sp'rit of Caledonian Schools. Learning's our Aim, and all our Care, to reach At Elegance and Gracefulness of Speech, And the Address, from Bashfulness refin'd, Which hangs a Weight upon a worthy Mind. The Grammar's good, but Pedantry brings down The gentle Dunce below the sprightly Clown. Get seven score Verse of Ovid's Trist by heart, To rattle o'er, else I shall make you smart, Cry snarling Dominies that little ken: Such may teach Parots, but our Mr. John Lesly, Master of the School, a Gentleman of true Learning; who, by his excellent Method, most worthily fills his Place. LESLY Men. EPILOGUE, after the acting of the Drummer, spoke by Mr. Maurice Cockburn, another Son of Colonel Cockburn's. Our Plays are done—Now criticise, and spare not; And tho' you are not fully pleas'd, we care not. We have a Reason on our Side—and that is, Your Treat has one good Property—'tis gratis. We've pleas'd our selves; and if we have good Judges, We value not a Head where nothing lodges. The generous Men of Sense will kindly praise us, And, if we make a little Snapper, raise us: Such know th'aspiring Soul at manly Dawn, Abhors the sowr Rebuke, and carping Thrawin; But rises, on the Hope of a great Name, Up all the rugged Roads that lead to Fame. Our Breasts already pant to gain Renown At Senates, Courts, by Arms or by the Gown; Or by Improvements of Paternal Fields, Which never failing Joy and Plenty yields; Or by deep Draughts of the Castalian Springs, To soar with Mantuan or Horatian Wings. Hey Boys! the Day's our ain! the Ladies smile! Which over-recompenses all our Toil! Delights of Mankind, tho' in some small Parts We are deficient, yet our Wills and Hearts Are your's; and, when more perfect, shall endeavour, By acting better, to secure your Favour: To Spinnets then retire, and play a few Tunes, 'Till we get thro' our Gregories and Newtons; And, some Years hence, we'll tell another Tale; 'Till then, ye bonny blooming Buds,—Farewell. PROLOGUE spoke by Mr. Anthony Aston, the first Nigh[t] the[y] acted in Winter 1726. 'Tis I,—dear Caledonians, blythsome TONY, That oft, last Winter, pleas'd the Brave and Bonny With Medley, merry Song, and comick Scene; Your Kindness then has brought me here again: After a Circuit round the Queen of Isles, To gain your Friendship and approving Smiles, Experience bids me hope;—tho' South the Tweed The Dastards said, “He never will succeed: “What! such a Country look for any Good in! “That does not relish Plays,—nor Pork,—nor Pudding!” Thus great Columbus by an Idiot Crew Was ridicul'd, at first, for his just View; Yet his undaunted Spirit ne'er gave Ground, Till he a new and better World had found. So I—laugh on—the Simile is bold; But Faith 'tis just: For till this Body's cold, Columbus like, I'll push for Fame and Gold. A CHARACTER. Of Judgment just, and Fancy clear, Industrious, yet not avaritious; No Slave to groundless Hope and Fear, Chearful, yet hating to be vitious. From Envy free, tho' prais'd not vain, Ne'er acting without Honour's Warrant; Still equal, generous and humane, As Husband, Master, Friend and Parent. So modest, as scarce to be known By glaring, proud conceited Asses, Whose little Spirits aften frown On such as their less Worth surpasses. Ye'll own he's a deserving Man, That in these Out-lines stand before ye; And trowth the Picture I have drawn, Is very like my Friend The Character, tho' true, has something in it so great, that my too modest Friend will not allow me to set his Name to it. But this, and some few other Wants, shall be made out afterwards from my Register of Supplies. . . ODE To Alexander Murray of Brughton, Esq; On his Marriage with Lady Euphemia, Daughter to the Right Honourable Earl of Galloway. 'Tis conquering Love alone can move The Best to all that's great; It sweetly binds two equal Minds, And makes a happy State, When such as MURRAY, of a Temper even, And honour'd Worth, receives a Mate from Heaven. Joy to you, Sir, and Joy to her, Whose softer Charms can sooth, With smiling Pow'r, a sullen Hour, And make your Life flow smooth. Man's but unfinish'd, 'till by Hymen's Ties, His sweeter Half lock'd in his Bosom lyes. The general Voice approve your Choice, Their Sentiments agree, With Fame allow'd, that she's a good Branch sprung from a right Tree. Long may the Graces of her Mind delight Your Soul, and long her Beauties bless your Sight. May the bright Guard, who love reward, With Man recoyn'd again, In Offspring fair make her their Care, In Hours of joyful Pain: And may my Patron healthful live to see, By her a brave and bonny Progeny. Let youthful Swains who 'tend your Plains, Touch the tun'd Reed, and sing, While Maids advance in sprightly Dance, All in the rural Ring; And with the Muse thank the immortal Powers, Placing with Joy EUPHEMIA's Name with your's. ODE To the Memory of Mrs. Forbes, Lady Newhall. Ah Life! thou short uncertain Blaze, Scarce worthy to be wish'd, or lov'd; When by strict Death, so many Ways, So soon the Sweetest are remov'd. In Prime of Life and lovely Glow, The dear BRUCINA must submit; Nor could ward of[f] the fatal Blow, With every Beauty, Grace and Wit. If outward Charms, and Temper sweet, The chearful Smile, and Thought sublime, Could have preserv'd, she ne'er had met A Change, 'till Death had sunk with Time. Her Soul glanc'd with each heavenly Ray, Her Form with all these Beauties fair, For which young Brides and Mothers pray, And wish for to their Infant Care. Sowr Spleen or Anger, Passion rude, These Opposites to Peace and Heaven, Ne'er pal'd her Cheek, or fir'd her Blood; Her Mind was ever calm and even. Come, fairest Nymphs, and gentle Swains, Give loose to Tears of tender Love; Strow fragrant Flowers on her Remains, While sighing round her Grave you move. In mournful Notes your Pain express, While with Reflection you run o'er, How excellent, how good she was! She was! alas! but is no more! Yet piously correct your Moan, And raise religious Thoughts on hie, After her spotless Soul, that's gone To Joys that ne'er can fade or die. On a Slate's falling from a House on Mris. M. M?k's Breast. Was Venus angry, and in Spite, Allow'd that Stane to fa', Imagining these Breasts so white Contain'd a Heart of Snaw? Was her wing'd Son sae cankert set To wound her lovely Skin, Because his Arrows could not get A Passage farder in? No: She is to Love's Goddess dear, Her smiling Boy's Delight— It was some Hag that doughtna bear Sic Charms to vex her Sight.

THE GENTLE SHEPHERD, A Pastoral Comedy; Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable, SUSANNA Countess of Eglintoun. To the Countess of Eglintoun, with the following Pastoral. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Accept, O EGLINTOUN! the rural Lays. That, bound to thee, thy Poet humbly pays: The Muse, that oft has rais'd her tuneful Strains, A frequent Guest on Scotia's blessful Plains, That oft has sung, her list'ning Youth to move, The Charms of Beauty, and the Force of Love, Once more resumes the still successful Lay, Delighted, thro' the verdant Meads to stray. O! come, invok'd, and pleas'd, with her repair, To breathe the balmy Sweets of purer Air, In the cool Evening negligently laid, Or near the Stream, or in the rural Shade, Propitious hear, and, as thou hear'st, approve The Gentle Shepherd's tender Tale of Love. Instructed from these Scenes, what glowing Fires Inflame the Breast that real Love inspires! The Fair shall read of Ardors, Sighs and Tears. All that a Lover hopes, and all he fears. Hence too, what Passions in his Bosom rise! What dawning Gladness sparkles in his Eyes! When first the Fair One, pitious of his Fate, Kind of her Scorn, and vanquish'd of her Hate, With willing Mind, is bounteous to relent, And blushing beauteous smiles the kind Consent! Love's Passion here in each Extreme is shown, In Charlot's Smile, or in Maria's Frown. With Words like these, that fail'd not to engage, Love courted Beauty in a golden Age, Pure and untaught, such Nature first inspir'd, Ere yet the Fair affected Phrase desir'd. His secret Thoughts were undisguis'd with Art, His Words ne'er knew to differ from his Heart. He speaks his Loves so artless and sincere, As thy Eliza might be pleas'd to hear. Heaven only to the Rural State bestows Conquest o'er Life, and Freedom from its Woes; Secure alike from Envy and from Care; Nor rais'd by Hope, nor yet depress'd by Fear: Nor Want's lean Hand its Happiness constrains, Nor Riches torture with ill-gotten Gains. No secret Guilt its stedfast Peace destroys, No wild Ambition interrupts its Joys. Blest still to spend the Hours that Heav'n has lent, In humble Goodness, and in calm Content. Serenely gentle, as the Thoughts that roll, Sinless and pure, in fair Humeia's Soul. But now the Rural State these Joys has lost; Even Swains no more that Innocence can boast. Love speaks no more what Beauty may believe, Prone to betray, and practis'd to deceive. Now Happiness foresakes her blest Retreat, The peaceful Dwellings where she fix'd her Seat. The pleasing Fields she wont of old to grace, Companion to an upright sober Race; When on the sunny Hill, or verdant Plain, Free and familiar with the Sons of Men, To crown the Pleasures of the blameless Feast, She uninvited came a welcome Guest: Ere yet an Age, grown rich in impious Arts, Brib'd from their Innocence incautious Hearts; Then grudging Hate, and sinful Pride succeed, Cruel Revenge, and false unrighteous Deed; Then dowrless Beauty lost the Power to move; The Rust of Lucre stain'd the Gold of Love. Bounteous no more, and hospitably good, The genial Hearth first blush'd with Strangers Blood: The Friend no more upon the Friend relies, And semblant Falshood puts on Truth's Disguise. The peaceful Houshold fill'd with dire Alarms, The ravish'd Virgin mourns her slighted Charms; The Voice of impious Mirth is heard around; In Guilt they feast, in Guilt the Bowl is crown'd: Unpunish'd Violence lords it o'er the Plains, And Happiness forsakes the guilty Swains. Oh Happiness! from humane Search retir'd, Where art thou to be found by all desir'd? Nun sober and devout! why art thou fled, To hide in Shades thy meek contented Head? Virgin of Aspect mild! ah why unkind, Fly'st thou displeas'd, the Commerce of Mankind? O! teach our Steps to find the secret Cell, Where, with thy Sire Content, thou lov'st to dwell. Or say, dost thou a duteous Handmaid wait Familiar at the Chambers of the Great? Dost thou pursue the Voice of them that call To noisy Revel, and to Midnight Ball? Or the full Banquet when we feast our Soul, Dost thou inspire the Mirth, or mix the Bowl? Or, with th'industrious Planter, dost thou talk, Conversing freely in an Evening Walk? Say, does the Miser e'er thy Face behold Watchful and studious of the treasured Gold? Seeks Knowledge, not in vain, thy much lov'd Pow'r, Still musing silent at the Morning Hour? May we thy Presence hope in War's Alarms, In Stair's Wisdom, or in Erskine's Charms. In vain our flatt'ring Hopes our Steps beguile, The flying Good eludes the Searcher's Toil: In vain we seek the City or the Cell, Alone with Vertue knows the Pow'r to dwell. Nor need Mankind despair these Joys to know, The Gift themselves may on themselves bestow. Soon, soon we might the precious Blessing boast; But many Passions must the Blessing cost: Infernal Malice, inly pining Hate, And Envy, grieving at another's State. Revenge no more must in our Hearts remain, Or burning Lust, or Avarice of Gain. When these are in the humane Bosom nurst, Can Peace reside in Dwellings so accurst? Unlike, O EGLINTOUN! thy happy Breast, Calm and serene, enjoys the heavenly Guest; From the tumultuous Rule of Passions free'd, Pure in thy Thought, and spotless in thy Deed. In Vertues rich, in Goodness unconfin'd, Thou shin'st a fair Example to thy Kind; Sincere and equal to thy Neighbour's Name, How swift to praise, how guiltless to defame? Bold in thy Presence Bashfulness appears, And backward Merit loses all its Fears. Supremely blest by Heav'n, Heav'n's richest Grace, Confest is thine, an early blooming Race. Whose pleasing Smiles shall guardian Wisdom arm, Divine Instruction! taught of thee to charm. What Transports shall they to thy Soul impart? (The conscious Transports of a Parent's Heart) When thou beholdst them of each Grace possest, And sighing Youths imploring to be blest; After thy Image form'd, with Charms like thine, Or in the Visit, or the Dance to shine. Thrice happy! who succeed their Mother's Praise, The lovely EGLINTOUNS of other Days. Mean while peruse the following tender Scenes, And listen to thy native Poet's Strains. In ancient Garb the home-bred Muse appears, The Garb our Muses wore in former Years; As in a Glass reflected, here behold How smiling Goodness look'd in Days of old. Nor blush to read where Beauty's Praise is shown, Or vertuous Love, the Likeness of thy own; While 'midst the various Gifts that gracious Heaven, To thee, in whom it is well pleas'd, has given, Let this, O EGLINTOUN! delight thee most, T'enjoy that Innocence the World has lost.

Beneath the South side of a Craigy Beild, Where Crystal Springs the halesome Waters yield, Twa youthful Shepherds on the Gowans lay, Tenting their Flocks ae bonny Morn of May. Poor Roger granes till hollow Echoes ring; But blyther Patie likes to laugh and sing. PATIE and ROGER. Pat. This sunny Morning, Roger, chears my Blood, And puts all Nature in a jovial Mood. How heartsome 'tis to see the rising Plants? To hear the Birds chirm o'er their pleasing Rants? How halesome 'tis to snuff the cauler Air, And all the Sweets it bears when void of Care? What ails thee, Roger, then? what gars the[e] grane? Tell me the Cause of thy ill season'd Pain. Rog. I'm born, O Patie! to a thrawart Fate; I'm born to strive with Hardships sad and great. Tempest may cease to jaw the rowan Flood, Corbies and Tods to grein for Lambkins Blood; But I, opprest with never ending Grief, Maun ay despair of lighting on Relief. Pat. The Bees shall loath the Flower, and quit the Hive, The Saughs on Boggie-Ground shall cease to thrive, Ere scornful Queans, or Loss of warldly Gear, Shall spill my Rest, or ever force a Tear. Rog. Sae might I say; but 'tis no easy done By ane whase Saul is sadly out of Tune. You have sae saft a Voice, and slid a Tongue, You are the Darling of baith auld and young. If I but ettle at a Sang, or speak, They dit their Lugs, syne up their Leglens cleek; And jeer me hameward frae the Loan or Bught, While I'm confus'd with mony a vexing Thought: Yet I am tall, and as well built as thee, Nor mair unlikely to a Lass's Eye. For ilka Sheep ye have, I'll number ten, And should, as ane may think, come farer ben. Pat. But ablins, Nibour, ye have not a Heart, And downa eithly wi' your Cunzie part. If that be true, what signifies your Gear? A Mind that's scrimpit never wants some Care. Rog. My Byar tumbled, nine braw Nowt were smoor'd, Three Elf-shot were; yet I these Ills endur'd: In Winter last, my Cares were very sma', Tho' Scores of Wathers perish'd in the Snaw. Pat. Were your bein Rooms as thinly stock'd as mine, Less you wad lose, and less you wad repine. He that has just enough, can soundly sleep; The O'ercome only fashes Fowk to keep. Rog. May Plenty flow upon thee for a Cross, That thou may'st thole the Pangs of mony a Loss. O mayst thou doat on some fair paughty Wench, That ne'er will lout thy lowan Drouth to quench, 'Till bris'd beneath the Burden, thou cry Dool, And awn that ane may fret that is nae Fool. Pat. Sax good fat Lambs I sald them ilka Clute At the West-port, and bought a winsome Flute, Of Plum-tree made, with Iv'ry Virles round, A dainty Whistle with a pleasant Sound: I'll be mair canty wi't, and ne'er cry Dool, Than you with all your Cash, ye dowie Fool. Rog. Na, Patie, na! I'm nae sic churlish Beast, Some other thing lyes heavier at my Breast: I dream'd a dreary Dream this hinder Night, That gars my Flesh a' creep yet with the Fright. Pat. Now to a Friend how silly's this Pretence, To ane wha you and a' your Secrets kens: Daft are your Dreams, as daftly wad ye hide Your well seen Love, and dorty Jenny's Pride. Take Courage, Roger, me your Sorrows tell, And safely think nane kens them but your sell. Rog. Indeed now, Patie, ye have guess'd o'er true, And there is nathing I'll keep up frae you. Me dorty Jenny looks upon a-squint; To speak but till her I dare hardly mint: In ilka Place she jeers me air and late, And gars me look bumbaz'd, and unko blate: But yesterday I met her 'yont a Know, She fled as frae a Shelly-coated Kow. She Bauldy loes, Bauldy that drives the Car; But gecks at me, and says I smell of Tar. Pat. But Bauldy loes not her, right well I wat; He sighs for Neps—sae that may stand for that. Rog. I wish I cou'dna loo her—but in vain, I still maun doat, and thole her proud Disdain. My Bawty is a Cur I dearly like, Even while he fawn'd, she strak the poor dumb Tyke: If I had fill'd a Nook within her Breast, She wad have shawn mair Kindness to my Beast. When I begin to tune my Stock and Horn, With a' her Face she shaws a caulrife Scorn. Last Night I play'd, ye never heard sic Spite, O'er Bogie was the Spring, and her Delyte; Yet tauntingly she at her Cousin speer'd, Gif she cou'd tell what Tune I play'd, and sneer'd. Flocks, wander where ye like, I dinna care, I'll break my Reed, and never whistle mair. Pat. E'en do sae, Roger, wha can help Misluck, Saebeins she be sic a thrawin-gabet Chuck? Yonder's a Craig, since ye have tint all Hope, Gae till't your ways, and take the Lover's Lowp. Rog. I needna mak sic Speed my Blood to spill, I'll warrant Death come soon enough a Will. Pat. Daft Gowk! leave off that silly whindging Way; Seem careless, there's my Hand ye'll win the Day. Hear how I serv'd my Lass I love as well As ye do Jenny, and with Heart as leel: Last Morning I was gay and early out, Upon a Dike I lean'd glowring about, I saw my Meg come linkan o'er the Lee; I saw my Meg, but Meggy saw na me: For yet the Sun was wading thro' the Mist, And she was closs upon me ere she wist; Her Coats were kiltit, and did sweetly shaw Her straight bare Legs that whiter were than Snaw; Her Cockernony snooded up fou sleek, Her Haffet-Locks hang waving on her Cheek; Her Cheek sae ruddy, and her Een sae clear; And O! her Mouth's like ony hinny Pear. Neat, neat she was, in Bustine Waste-coat clean, As she came skiffing o'er the dewy Green. Blythsome, I cry'd, my bonny Meg, come here, I ferly wherefore ye're sae soon asteer; But I can guess, ye're gawn to gather Dew: She scour'd awa, and said, What's that to you? Then fare ye well, Meg Dorts, and e'en's ye like, I careless cry'd, and lap in o'er the Dike. I trow, when that she saw, within a Crack, She came with a right thievless Errand back; Misca'd me first,—then bade me hound my Dog To wear up three waff Ews stray'd on the Bog. I leugh, and sae did she; then with great Haste I clasp'd my Arms about her Neck and Waste, About her yielding Waste, and took a Fouth Of sweetest Kisses frae her glowing Mouth. While hard and fast I held her in my Grips, My very Saul came lowping to my Lips. Sair, sair she flet wi' me 'tween ilka Smack; But well I kent she meant nae as she spake. Dear Roger, when your Jo puts on her Gloom, Do ye sae too, and never fash your Thumb. Seem to forsake her, soon she'll change her Mood; Gae woo anither, and she'll gang clean wood. Rog. Kind Patie, now fair fa' your honest Heart, Ye're ay sae cadgy, and have sic an Art To hearten ane: For now as clean's a Leek, Ye've cherish'd me since ye began to speak. Sae for your Pains, I'll make ye a Propine, My Mother (rest her Saul) she made it fine, A Tartan Plaid, spun of good Hawslock Woo, Scarlet and green the Sets, the Borders blew, With Spraings like Gowd and Siller, cross'd with black; I never had it yet upon my Back. Well are ye wordy o't, wha have sae kind Red up my revel'd Doubts, and clear'd my Mind. Pat. Well hald ye there;—and since ye've frankly made A Present to me of your braw new Plaid, My Flute's be your's, and she too that's sae nice Shall come a will, gif ye'll tak my Advice. Rog. As ye advise, I'll promise to observ't; But ye maun keep the Flute, ye best deserv't. Now tak it out, and gie's a bonny Spring, For I'm in tift to hear you play and sing. Pat. But first we'll take a turn up to the Height, And see gif all our Flocks be feeding right. Be that time Bannocks, and a Shave of Cheese, Will make a Breakfast that a Laird might please; Might please the daintiest Gabs, were they sae wise, To season Meat with Health instead of Spice. When we have tane the Grace-drink at this Well, I'll whistle fine, and sing t'ye like my sell. Exeunt. N.B.—This first Scene is the only Piece in this Volume that was printed in the first. Having carried the Pastoral the length of five Acts at the Desire of some Persons of Distinction, I was obliged to reprint this preluding Scene with the rest. SCENE II. A flowrie Howm between twa verdent Braes, Where Lasses use to wash and spread their Claiths, A trotting Burnie wimpling thro' the Ground, Its Channel Peebles, shining, smooth and round; Here view twa barefoot Beauties clean and clear; First please your Eye, next gratify your Ear, While Jenny what she wishes discommends, And Meg with better Sense true Love defends. PEGGY and JENNY. Jen. Come, Meg, let's fa' to wark upon this Green, The shining Day will bleech our Linen clean; The Water's clear, the Lift unclouded blew, Will make them like a Lilly wet with Dew. Peg. Go farer up the Burn to Habby's How, Where a' the Sweets of Spring and Summer grow; Between twa Birks, out o'er a little Lin The Water fa's, and makes a singand Din; A Pool breast-deep beneath, as clear as Glass, Kisses with easy Whirles the bordring Grass: We'll end our Washing while the Morning's cool, And when the Day grows het, we'll to the Pool, There wash our sells—'tis healthfu' now in May, And sweetly cauler on sae warm a Day. Jen. Daft Lassie, when we're naked, what'll ye say, Gif our twa Herds come brattling down the Brae, And see us sae? That jeering Fallow Pate Wad taunting say, Haith, Lasses, ye're no blate. Peg. We're far frae ony Road, and out of Sight; The Lads they're feeding far beyont the Height: But tell me now, dear Jenny, (we're our lane) What gars ye plague your Wooer with Disdain? The Nibours a' tent this as well as I, That Roger loos you, yet ye carna by. What ails ye at him? Trowth, between us twa, He's wordy you the best Day e'er ye saw. Jen. I dinna like him, Peggy, there's an end; A Herd mair sheepish yet I never kend. He kaims his Hair indeed, and gaes right snug, With Ribbon-knots at his blew Bonnet-lug; Whilk pensily he wears a thought a-jee, And spreads his Garters dic'd beneath his Knee. He falds his Owrlay down his Breast with Care; And few gang trigger to the Kirk or Fair. For a' that, he can neither sing nor say, Except, How d'ye—or, There's a bonny Day. Peg. Ye dash the Lad with constant slighting Pride; Hatred for Love is unco sair to bide: But ye'll repent ye, if his Love grows cauld. What like's a dorty Maiden when she's auld? Like dawted We'an that tarrows at its Meat, That for some feckless Whim will orp and greet. The lave laugh at it, till the Dinner's past, And syne the Fool thing is oblig'd to fast, Or scart anither's Leavings at the last. Fy, Jenny, think, and dinna sit your Time. Jen. I never thought a single Life a Crime. Peg. Nor I—but Love in Whispers lets us ken, That Men were made for us, and we for Men. Jen. If Roger is my Jo, he kens himsell; For sic a Tale I never heard him tell. He glowrs and sighs, and I can guess the Cause, But wha's oblig'd to spell his Hums and Haws? When e'er he likes to tell his Mind mair plain, I'se tell him frankly ne'er to do't again. They're Fools that Slavery like, and may be free: The Cheils may a' knit up themsells for me. Peg. Be doing your Ways; for me, I have a mind To be as yielding as my Patie's kind. Jen. Heh! Lass, how can ye loo that Rattle-scull, A very Deel that ay maun hae his Will? We'll soon here tell what a poor fighting Life You twa will lead, sae soon's ye're Man and Wife. Peg. I'll rin the Risk; nor have I ony Fear, But rather think ilk langsome Day a Year, Till I with Pleasure mount my Bridal-bed, Where on my Patie's Breast I'll lean my Head. There we may kiss as lang as Kissing's good, And what we do, there's nane dare call it rude. He's get his Will: Why no? 'tis good my Part To give him that; and he'll give me his Heart. Jen. He may indeed, for ten or fifteen Days, Mak meikle o' ye, with an unco Fraise; And daut ye baith afore Fowk and your lane: But soon as his Newfangleness is gane, He'll look upon you as his Tether-stake, And think he's tint his Freedom for your Sake. Instead then of lang Days of sweet Delite, Ae Day be dumb, and a' the neist he'll flite: And may be, in his Barlickhoods, ne'er stick To lend his loving Wife a loundering Lick. Peg. Sic coarse-spun Thoughts as thae want Pith to move My settl'd Mind, I'm o'er far gane in Love. Patie to me is dearer than my Breath; But want of him I dread nae other Skaith. There's nane of a' the Herds that tread the Green Has sic a Smile, or sic twa glancing Een. And then he speaks with sic a taking Art, His Words they thirle like Musick thro' my Heart. How blythly can he sport, and gently rave, And jest at feckless Fears that fright the lave? Ilk Day that he's alane upon the Hill, He reads fell Books that teach him meikle Skill. He is—But what need I say that or this? I'd spend a Month to tell you what he is! In a' he says or does, there's sic a Gait, The rest seem Coofs compar'd with my dear Pate. His better Sense will lang his Love secure: Ill Nature heffs in Sauls are weak and poor. Jen. Hey! bonny Lass of Branksome, or't be lang, Your witty Pate will put you in a Sang. O! 'tis a pleasant thing to be a Bride; Syne whindging Getts about your Ingle-side, Yelping for this or that with fasheous Din, To mak them Brats then ye maun toil and spin. Ae We'an fa's sick, ane scads it sell we Broe, Ane breaks his Shin, anither tynes his Shoe; The Deel gaes o'er John Wobster, Hame grows Hell, When Pate misca's ye war than Tongue can tell. Peg. Yes, 'tis a heartsome thing to be a Wife, When round the Ingle-edge young Sprouts are rife. Gif I'm sae happy, I shall have Delight, To hear their little Plaints, and keep them right. Wow! Jenny, can there greater Pleasure be, Than see sic wee Tots toolying at your Knee; When a' they ettle at—their greatest Wish, Is to be made of, and obtain a Kiss? Can there be Toil in tenting Day and Night, The like of them, when Love makes Care Delight? Jen. But Poortith, Peggy, is the warst of a', Gif o'er your Heads ill Chance shou'd Beggary draw: But little Love, or canty Chear can come, Frae duddy Doublets, and a Pantry toom. Your Nowt may die—the Spate may bear away Frae aff the Howms your dainty Rucks of Hay.— The thick blawn Wreaths of Snaw, or blashy Thows, May smoor your Wathers, and may rot your Ews. A Dyvour buys your Butter, Woo and Cheese, But, or the Day of Payment, breaks and flees. With glooman Brow the Laird seeks in his Rent: 'Tis no to gi'e; your Merchant's to the bent; His Honour mauna want, he poinds your Gear: Syne, driven frae House and Hald, where will ye steer? Dear Meg, be wise, and live a single Life; Troth 'tis nae Mows to be a marry'd Wife. Peg. May sic ill Luck befa' that silly She, Wha has sic Fears; for that was never me. Let Fowk bode well, and strive to do their best; Nae mair's requir'd, let Heaven make out the rest. I've heard my honest Uncle aften say, That Lads shou'd a' for Wives that's vertuous pray: For the maist thrifty Man cou'd never get A well stor'd Room, unless his Wife wad let: Wherefore nocht shall be wanting on my Part, To gather Wealth to raise my Shepherd's Heart. What e'er he wins, I'll guide with canny Care, And win the Vogue, at Market, Tron, or Fair, For halesome, clean, cheap and sufficient Ware. A Flock of Lambs, Cheese, Butter, and some Woo, Shall first be sald, to pay the Laird his Due; Syne a' behind's our ain.—Thus, without Fear, With Love and Rowth we thro' the Warld will steer: And when my Pate in Bairns and Gear grows rife, He'll bless the Day he gat me for his Wife. Jen. But what if some young Giglit on the Green, With dimpled Cheeks, and twa bewitching Een, Should gar your Patie think his haff-worn Meg, And her kend Kisses, hardly worth a Feg? Peg. Nae mair of that;—dear Jenny, to be free, There's some Men constanter in Love than we: Nor is the Ferly great, when Nature kind Has blest them with Solidity of Mind. They'll reason calmly, and with Kindness smile, When our short Passions wad our Peace beguile. Sae whensoe'er they slight their Maiks at hame, 'Tis ten to ane the Wives are maist to blame. Then I'll employ with Pleasure a' my Art To keep him chearfu', and secure his Heart. At Even, when he comes weary frae the Hill, I'll have a' things made ready to his Will. In Winter, when he toils thro' Wind and Rain, A bleezing Ingle, and a clean Hearth-stane. And soon as he flings by his Plaid and Staff, The seething Pot's be ready to take aff. Clean Hagabag I'll spread upon his Board, And serve him with the best we can afford. Good Humour and white Bigonets shall be Guards to my Face, to keep his Love for me. Jen. A Dish of married Love right soon grows cauld, And dosens down to nane, as Fowk grow auld. Peg. But we'll grow auld togither, and ne'er find The Loss of Youth, when Love grows on the Mind. Bairns, and their Bairns, make sure a firmer Ty, Than ought in Love the like of us can spy. See yon twa Elms that grow up Side by Side, Suppose them, some Years syne, Bridegroom and Bride; Nearer and nearer ilka Year they've prest, Till wide their spreading Branches are increast, And in their Mixture now are fully blest. This shields the other frae the Eastlin Blast, That in Return defends it frae the West. Sic as stand single,—a State sae lik'd by you! Beneath ilk Storm, frae ev'ry Airth, maun bow. Jen. I've done,—I yield, dear Lassie, I maun yield, Your better Sense has fairly won the Field, With the Assistance of a little Fae Lyes darn'd within my Breast this mony a Day. Peg. Alake! poor Prisoner! Jenny, that's no fair, That ye'll no let the wee thing tak the Air: Haste, let him out, we'll tent as well's we can, Gif he be Bauldy's or poor Roger's Man. Jen. Anither time's as good,—for see the Sun Is right far up, and we're no yet begun To freath the Graith;—if canker'd Madge our Aunt Come up the Burn, she'll gie's a wicked Rant: But when we've done, I'll tell ye a' my Mind; For this seems true,—nae Lass can be unkind. Exeunt. End of the First ACT. ACT II. SCENE I. A snug Thack-house, before the Door a Green; Hens on the Midding, Ducks in Dubs are seen. On this Side stands a Barn, on that a Byre; A Peat-stack joins, and forms a rural Square. The House is Glaud's;—there you may see him lean, And to his Divot-Seat invite his Frien'. GLAUD and SYMON. Glaud. Good-morrow, Nibour Symon,—come sit down, And gie's your Cracks.—What's a' the News in Town? They tell me ye was in the ither Day, And sald your Crummock and her bassend Quey. I'll warrant ye've coft a Pund of Cut and Dry; Lug out your Box, and gie's a Pipe to try. Sym. With a' my Heart;—and tent me now, auld Boy, I've gather'd News will kittle your Mind with Joy. I cou'dna rest till I came o'er the Burn, To tell ye things have taken sic a Turn, Will gar our vile Oppressors stend like Flaes, And skulk in Hidlings on the Hether Braes. Glaud. Fy, blaw! Ah! Symie, ratling Chiels ne'er stand To cleck and spread the grossest Lies aff hand, Whilk soon flies round like Will-fire far and near: But loose your Poke, be't true or fause, let's hear. Sym. Seeing's believing, Glaud, and I have seen Hab, that abroad has with our Master been; Our brave good Master, wha right wisely fled, And left a fair Estate, to save his Head: Because ye ken fou well he bravely chose To stand his Liege's Friend with Great Montrose. Now Cromwell's gane to Nick; and ane ca'd Monk Has play'd the Rumple a right slee Begunk, Restor'd King CHARLES, and ilka thing's in Tune: And Habby says, We'll see Sir William soon. Glaud. That makes me blyth indeed;—but dinna flaw: Tell o'er your News again! and swear till't a'; And saw ye Hab! And what did Halbert say? They have been e'en a dreary Time away. Now GOD be thanked that our Laird's come hame, And his Estate, say, can he eithly claim? Sym. They that hag-raid us till our Guts did grane, Like greedy Bairs, dare nae mair do't again; And good Sir William sall enjoy his ain. Glaud. And may he lang; for never did he stent Us in our thriving, with a racket Rent: Nor grumbl'd, if ane grew rich; or shor'd to raise Our Mailens, when we pat on Sunday's Claiths. Sym. Nor wad he lang, with senseless saucy Air, Allow our lyart Noddles to be bare. Put on your Bonnet, Symon;—Tak a Seat.— How's all at hame?—How's Elspa? How does Kate? How sells black Cattle?—What gie's Woo this Year?— And sic like kindly Questions wad he speer. Glaud. Then wad he gar his Butler bring bedeen The nappy Bottle ben, and Glasses clean, Whilk in our Breast rais'd sic a blythsome Flame, As gart me mony a time gae dancing hame. My Heart's e'en rais'd! Dear Nibour, will ye stay, And tak your Dinner here with me the Day? We'll send for Elspath too—and upo' sight, I'll whistle Pate and Roger frae the Height: I'll yoke my Sled, and send to the neist Town, And bring a Draught of Ale baith stout and brown, And gar our Cottars a', Man, Wife and We'an, Drink till they tine the Gate to stand their lane. Sym. I wad na bauk my Friend his blyth Design, Gif that it hadna first of a' been mine: For heer-yestreen I brew'd a Bow of Maut, Yestreen I slew twa Wathers prime and fat; A Firlot of good Cakes my Elspa beuk, And a large Ham hings reesting in the Nook: I saw my sell, or I came o'er the Loan, Our meikle Pot that scads the Whey put on, A Mutton-bouk to boil:—And ane we'll roast; And on the Haggies Elspa spares nae Cost; Sma' are they shorn, and she can mix fu' nice The gusty Ingans with a Curn of Spice: Fat are the Puddings,—Heads and Feet well sung. And we've invited Nibours auld and young, To pass this Afternoon with Glee and Game, And drink our Master's Health and Welcome-hame. Ye mauna then refuse to join the rest, Since ye're my nearest Friend that I like best. Bring wi' ye a' your Family, and then, When e'er you please, I'll rant wi' you again. Glaud. Spoke like ye'r sell, Auld-birky, never fear But at your Banquet I shall first appear. Faith we shall bend the Bicker, and look bauld, Till we forget that we are fail'd or auld. Auld, said I! troth I'm younger be a Score, With your good News, than what I was before. I'll dance or Een! Hey! Madge, come forth: D'ye hear? Enter Madge. Mad. The Man's gane gyte! Dear Symon, welcome here. What wad ye, Glaud, with a' this Haste and Din? Ye never let a Body sit to spin. Glaud. Spin! snuff—Gae break your Wheel, and burn your Tow, And set the meiklest Peat-stack in a Low. Syne dance about the Bane-fire till ye die, Since now again we'll soon Sir William see. Mad. Blyth News indeed! And wha was tald you o't? Glaud. What's that to you?—Gae get my Sunday's Coat; Wale out the whitest of my bobbit Bands, My white-skin Hose, and Mittons for my Hands; Then frae their Washing cry the Bairns in haste, And make your sells as trig, Head, Feet and Waist, As ye were a' to get young Lads or E'en; For we're gaun o'er to dine with Sym bedeen. Sym. Do, honest Madge:—And, Glaud, I'll o'er the gate, And see that a' be done as I wad hae't. Exeunt. SCENE II. The open Field.—A Cottage in a Glen, An auld Wife spinning at the sunny End.— At a small Distance, by a blasted Tree, With falded Arms, and haff rais'd Look ye see Bauldy his lane. Baul. What's this!—I canna bear't! 'tis war than Hell, To be sae burnt with Love, yet darna tell! O Peggy, sweeter than the dawning Day, Sweeter than gowany Glens, or new mawn Hay; Blyther than Lambs that frisk out o'er the Knows, Straighter than ought that in the Forest grows: Her Een the clearest Blob of Dew outshines; The Lilly in her Breast its Beauty tines. Her Legs, her Arms, her Cheeks, her Mouth, her Een, Will be my dead, that will be shortly seen! For Pate loes her,—wae's me! and she loes Pate; And I with Neps, by some unlucky Fate, Made a daft Vow:—O but ane be a Beast That makes rash Aiths till he's afore the Priest! I dare na speak my Mind, else a' the three, But doubt, wad prove ilk ane my Enemy. 'Tis sair to thole;—I'll try some Witchcraft Art, To break with ane, and win the other's Heart. Here Mausy lives, a Witch, that for sma' Price Can cast her Cantraips, and give me Advice. She can o'ercast the Night, and cloud the Moon, And mak the Deils obedient to her Crune. At Midnight Hours, o'er the Kirk-yards she raves, And howks unchristen'd We'ans out of their Graves; Boils up their Livers in a Warlock's Pow, Rins withershins about the Hemlock Low; And seven Times does her Prayers backward pray, Till Plotcock comes with Lumps of Lapland Clay, Mixt with the Venom of black Taids and Snakes; Of this unsonsy Pictures aft she makes Of ony ane she hates—and gars expire With slaw and racking Pains afore a Fire; Stuck fu' of Prins, the devilish Pictures melt, The Pain, by Fowk they represent, is felt. And yonder's Mause: Ay, ay, she kens fu' well, When ane like me comes rinning to the Deil. She and her Cat sit beeking in her Yard, To speak my Errand, faith amaist I'm fear'd: But I maun do't, tho' I should never thrive; They gallop fast that Deils and Lasses drive. Exit. SCENE III. A Green Kail-yard, a little Fount, Where Water popilan springs; There sits a Wife with Wrinkle-Front. And yet she spins and sings. Mause sings. “Peggy, now the King's come, “Peggy, now the King's come; “Thou may dance, and I shall sing, “Peggy, since the King's come. “Nae mair the Hawkies shalt thou milk, “But change thy Plaiding-Coat for Silk, “And be a Lady of that Ilk, “Now, Peggy, since the King's come. Enter Bauldy. Baul. How does auld honest Lucky of the Glen? Ye look baith hale and fere at threescore ten. Maus. E'en twining out a Threed with little Din, And beeking my cauld Limbs afore the Sun. What brings my Bairn this Gate sae air at Morn? Is there nae Muck to lead?—to thresh nae Corn? Baul. Enough of baith:—But something that requires Your helping Hand, employs now all my Cares. Maus. My helping Hand, alake! what can I do, That underneath baith Eild and Poortith bow? Baul. Ay, but ye're wise, and wiser far than we, Or maist Part of the Parish tells a Lie. Maus. Of what kind Wisdom think ye I'm possest, That lifts my Character aboon the rest? Baul. The Word that gangs, how ye're sae wise and fell, Ye'll may be take it ill gif I shou'd tell. Maus. What Fowk says of me, Bauldy, let me hear; Keep nathing up, ye nathing have to fear. Baul. Well, since ye bid me, I shall tell ye a', That ilk ane talks about you, but a Flaw. When last the Wind made Glaud a roofless Barn; When last the Burn bore down my Mither's Yarn; When Brawny Elf-shot never mair came hame; When Tibby kirn'd, and there nae Butter came; When Bessy Freetock's chuffy-cheeked We'an To a Fairy turn'd, and cou'd na stand its lane; When Watie wander'd ae Night thro' the Shaw, And tint himsell amaist amang the Snaw; When Mungo's Mear stood still, and swat with Fright, When he brought East the Howdy under Night; When Bawsy shot to dead upon the Green, And Sara tint a Snood was nae mair seen: You, Lucky, gat the Wyte of a' fell out, And ilka ane here dreads you round about. And sae they may that mint to do ye Skaith: For me to wrang ye, I'll be very laith; But when I neist make Grots, I'll strive to please You with a Firlot of them mixt with Pease. Maus. I thank ye, Lad;—now tell me your Demand, And, if I can, I'll lend my helping Hand. Baul. Then, I like Peggy,—Neps is fond of me;— Peggy likes Pate,—and Patie's bauld and slee, And loes sweet Meg.—But Neps I downa see.— Cou'd ye turn Patie's Love to Neps, and than Peggy's to me,—I'd be the happiest Man. Maus. I'll ry my Art to gar the Bowls row right; Sae gang your ways, and come again at Night: 'Gainst that time I'll some simple things prepare, Worth all your Pease and Grots; tak ye nae Care. Baul. Well, Mause, I'll come, gif I the Road can find: But if ye raise the Deil, he'll raise the Wind; Syne Rain and Thunder may be, when 'tis late, Will make the Night sae rough, I'll tine the Gate. We're a' to rant in Symie's at a Feast, O! will ye come like Badrans, for a Jest; And there ye can our different Haviours spy: There's nane shall ken o't there but you and I. Maus. 'Tis like I may,—but let na on what's past 'Tween you and me, else fear a kittle Cast. Baul. If I ought of your Secrets e'er advance, May ye ride on me ilka Night to France. Exit Bauldy. Mause her lane.Hard Luck, alake! when Poverty and Eild, Weeds out of Fashion, and a lanely Beild, With a sma' Cast of Wiles, should in a twitch, Gi'e ane the hatefu' Name a wrinkled Witch. This Fool imagines, as do mony sic, That I'm a Wretch in Compact with Auld Nick; Because by Education I was taught To speak and act aboon their common Thought. Their gross Mistake shall quickly now appear; Soon shall they ken what brought, what keeps me here; Nane kens but me,—and if the Morn were come, I'll tell them Tales will gar them a' sing dumb. Exit. SCENE IV. Behind a Tree, upon the Plain, Pate and his Peggy meet; In Love, without a vicious Stain, The bonny Lass and chearfu' Swain Change Vows and Kisses sweet. PATIE and PEGGY. Peg. O Patie, let me gang, I mauna stay, We're baith cry'd hame, and Jenny she's away. Pat. I'm laith to part sae soon; now we're alane, And Roger he's awa with Jenny gane: They're as content, for ought I hear or see, To be alane themsells, I judge, as we. Here, where Primroses thickest paint the Green, Hard by this little Burnie let us lean. Hark how the Lavrocks chant aboon our Heads, How saft the Westlin Winds sough thro' the Reeds. Peg. The scented Meadows,—Birds,—and healthy Breeze, For ought I ken, may mair than Peggy please. Pat. Ye wrang me sair, to doubt my being kind; In speaking sae, ye ca' me dull and blind. Gif I could fancy ought's sae sweet or fair As my dear Meg, or worthy of my Care. Thy Breath is sweeter than the sweetest Brier, Thy Cheek and Breast the finest Flowers appear. Thy Words excel the maist delightfu' Notes, That warble through the Merl or Mavis' Throats. With thee I tent nae Flowers that busk the Field, Or ripest Berries that our Mountains yield. The sweetest Fruits that hing upon the Tree, Are far inferior to a Kiss of thee. Peg. But Patrick, for some wicked End, may fleech, And Lambs should tremble when the Foxes preach. I dare na stay—ye Joker, let me gang, Anither Lass may gar ye change your Sang; Your Thoughts may flit, and I may thole the Wrang. Pat. Sooner a Mother shall her Fondness drap, And wrang the Bairn sits smiling on her Lap; The Sun shall change, the Moon to change shall cease, The Gaits to clim,—the Sheep to yield the Fleece, Ere ought by me be either said or done, Shall skaith our Love; I swear by all aboon. Peg. Then keep your Aith:—But mony Lads will swear, And be mansworn to twa in haff a Year. Now I believe ye like me wonder well; But if a fairer Face your Heart shou'd steal, Your Meg forsaken, bootless might relate, How she was dauted anes by faithless Pate. Pat. I'm sure I canna change, ye needna fear; Tho' we're but young, I've loo'd you mony a Year. I mind it well, when thou coud'st hardly gang, Or lisp out Words, I choos'd ye frae the thrang Of a' the Bairns, and led thee by the Hand, Aft to the Tansy-know, or Rashy strand. Thou smiling by my Side,—I took Delite, To pou the Rashes green, with Roots sae white, Of which, as well as my young Fancy cou'd, For thee I plet the flowry Belt and Snood. Peg. When first thou gade with Shepherds to the Hill, And I to milk the Ews first try'd my Skill; To bear a Leglen was nae toil to me, When at the Bught at E'en I met with thee. Pat. When Corns grew yellow, and the Hether-bells Bloom'd bonny on the Moor and rising Fells, Nae Birns, or Briers, or Whins e'er troubled me, Gif I cou'd find blae Berries ripe for thee. Peg. When thou didst wrestle, run, or putt the Stane, And wan the Day, my Heart was flightering fain: At all these Sports thou still gave Joy to me; For nane can wrestle, run, or putt with thee. Pat. Jenny sings saft the Broom of Cowden-knows, And Rosie lilts the Milking of the Ews; There's nane like Nansie, Jenny Nettles sings; At Turns in Maggy Lauder, Marion dings: But when my Peggy sings, with sweeter Skill, The Boat-man, or the Lass of Patie's Mill; It is a thousand times mair sweet to me: Tho' they sing well, they canna sing like thee. Peg. How eith can Lasses trow what they desire! And roos'd by them we love, blaws up that Fire: But wha loves best, let Time and Carriage try; Be constant, and my Love shall Time defy. Be still as now, and a' my Care shall be, How to contrive what pleasant is for thee. Pat. Wert thou a giglit Gawky like the lave, That little better than our Nowt behave; At nought they'll ferly;—senseless Tales believe; Be blyth for silly Heghts, for Trifles grieve:— Sic ne'er cou'd win my Heart, that kenna how, Either to keep a Prize, or yet prove true. But thou, in better Sense, without a Flaw, As in thy Beauty far excells them a', Continue kind; and a' my Care shall be, How to contrive what pleasing is for thee. Peg. Agreed;—but harken, yon's auld Aunty's Cry; I ken they'll wonder what can make us stay. Pat. And let them ferly.—Now, a kindly Kiss, Or fivescore good anes wad not be amiss; And syne we'll sing the Sang with tunefu' Glee, That I made up last Owk on you and me. Peg. Sing first, syne claim your Hire.— Pat. —Well, I agree. Patie sings. By the delicious Warmness of thy Mouth, And rowing Eyes that smiling tell the Truth, I guess, my Lassie, that as well as I, You're made for Love; and why should ye deny? Peggy sings. But ken ye, Lad, gin we confess o'er soon, Ye think us cheap, and syne the Wooing's done? The Maiden that o'er quickly tines her Power, Like unripe Fruit, will taste but hard and sowr. Patie sings. But gin they hing o'er lang upon the Tree, Their Sweetness they may tine; and sae may ye. Red cheeked you completely ripe appear; And I have thol'd and woo'd a lang haff Year. Peggy singing, falls into Patie's Arms. Then dinna pu' me, gently thus I fa' Into my Patie's Arms, for good and a'. But stint your Wishes to this kind Embrace; And mint nae farther till we've got the Grace. Patie with his left Hand about her Waste. O charming Armfu', hence ye Cares away, I'll kiss my Treasure a' the live lang Day; All Night I'll dream my Kisses o'er again, Till that Day come that ye'll be a' my ain. Sung by both. Sun, gallop down the Westlin Skies, Gang soon to bed, and quickly rise; O lash your Steeds, post Time away, And haste about our Bridal Day: And if ye're wearied, honest Light, Sleep, gin ye like, a Week that Night. End of the Second ACT. ACT III. SCENE I. Now turn your Eyes beyond yon spreading Lime, And tent a Man whase Beard seems bleech'd with Time; An Elvand fills his Hand, his Habit mean: Nae doubt ye'll think he has a Pedlar been. But whisht! it is the Knight in Masquerade, That comes hid in this Cloud to see his Lad. Observe how pleas'd the loyal Sufferer moves Thro' his auld Av'news, anes delightfu' Groves. Sir WILLIAM solus. The Gentleman thus hid in low Disguise, I'll for a Space unknown delight mine Eyes, With a full View of every fertile Plain, Which once I lost,—which now are mine again. Yet 'midst my Joys, some Prospects Pain renew, Whilst I my once fair Seat in Ruins view. Yonder, ah me! it desolately stands, Without a Roof; the Gates faln from their Bands; The Casements all broke down; no Chimney left; The naked Walls of Tap'stry all bereft: My Stables and Pavilions, broken Walls! That with each rainy Blast decaying falls: My Gardens, once adorn'd the most compleat, With all that Nature, all that Art makes sweet; Where, round the figur'd Green, and Peeble Walks, The dewy Flowers hung nodding on their Stalks: But, overgrown with Nettles, Docks and Brier, No Jaccacinths or Eglintines appear. How do those ample Walls to Ruin yield, Where Peach and Nect'rine Branches found a Beild, And bask'd in Rays, which early did produce Fruit fair to view, delightfu' in the Use! All round in Gaps, the most in Rubbish ly, And from what stands the wither'd Branches fly. These soon shall be repair'd:—And now my Joy Forbids all Grief,—when I'm to see my Boy, My only Prop, and Object of my Care, Since Heaven too soon call'd hame his Mother fair. Him, ere the Rays of Reason clear'd his Thought, I secretly to faithful Symon brought, And charg'd him strictly to conceal his Birth, 'Till we should see what changing Times brought forth. Hid from himself, he starts up by the Dawn, And ranges careless o'er the Height and Lawn, After his fleecy Charge, serenely gay, With other Shepherds whistling o'er the Day. Thrice happy Life! that's from Ambition free; Remov'd from Crowns and Courts, how chearfully A quiet contented Mortal spends his Time In hearty Health, his Soul unstain'd with Crime. Now tow'rds good Symon's House I'll bend my Way, And see what makes yon Gamboling to Day, All on the Green, in a fair wanton Ring, My youthful Tenants gayly dance and sing. Exit. SCENE II. 'Tis Symon's House, please to step in, And vissy't round and round; There's nought superfluous to give Pain, Or costly to be found. Yet all is clean: A clear Peat-Ingle Glances amidst the Floor; The Green-Horn Spoons, Beech-Luggies mingle, On Skelfs foregainst the Door. While the young Brood sport on the Green, The auld anes think it best, With the Brown Cow to clear their Een, Snuff, crack, and take their Rest. SYMON, GLAUD and ELSPA. Glaud. We anes were young our sells—I like to see The Bairns bob round with other merrilie. Troth, Symon, Patie's grown a strapan Lad, And better Looks than his I never bade. Amang our Lads, he bears the Gree awa', And tells his Tale the cleverest of them a'. Els. Poor Man!—he's a great Comfort to us baith: GOD mak him good, and hide him ay frae Skaith. He is a Bairn, I'll say't, well worth our Care, That ga'e us ne'er Vexation late or air. Glaud. I trow, Goodwife, if I be not mistane, He seems to be with Peggy's Beauty tane, And troth, my Niece is a right dainty We'an, As ye well ken: A bonnier needna be, Nor better,—be't she were nae Kin to me. Sym. Ha! Glaud, I doubt that ne'er will be a Match; My Patie's wild, and will be ill to catch: And or he were, for Reasons I'll no tell, I'd rather be mixt with the Mools my sell. Glaud. What Reason can ye have? There's nane, I'm sure, Unless ye may cast up that she's but poor: But gif the Lassie marry to my Mind, I'll be to her as my ain Jenny kind. Fourscore of breeding Ews of my ain Birn, Five Ky that at ae Milking fills a Kirn, I'll gi'e to Peggy that Day she's a Bride; By and attour, gif my good Luck abide, Ten Lambs at Spaining-time, as lang's I live, And twa Quey Cawfs I'll yearly to them give. Els. Ye offer fair, kind Glaud; but dinna speer What may be is not fit ye yet should here. Sym. Or this Day eight days likely he shall learn, That our Denial disna slight his Bairn. Glaud. Well, nae mair o't,—come, gie's the other Bend; We'll drink their Healths, whatever Way it end. Their Healths gae round. Sym. But will ye tell me, Glaud,—by some 'tis said, Your Niece is but a Fundling that was laid Down at your Hallon-side, ae Morn in May, Right clean row'd up, and bedded on dry Hay. Glaud. That clatteran Madge, my Titty, tells sic Flaws, When e'er our Meg her cankart Humour gaws. Enter Jenny. Jen. O Father! there's an auld Man on the Green, The fellest Fortune-teller e'er was seen: He tents our Loofs, and syne whops out a Book, Turns o'er the Leaves, and gie's our Brows a Look; Syne tells the oddest Tales that e'er ye heard. His Head is gray, and lang and gray his Beard. Sym. Gae bring him in; we'll hear what he can say: Name shall gang hungry by my House to Day. Exit Jenny. But for his telling Fortunes, troth I fear, He kens nae mair of that than my gray Mare. Glaud. Spae-men! the Truth of a' their Saws I doubt; For greater Liars never ran there out. Returns Jenny, bringing in Sir William; with them Patie. Sym. Ye're welcome, honest Carle;—here take a Seat. S. Will. I give ye Thanks, Goodman; I'se no be blate. Glaud drinks. Come t'ye, Friend:—How far came ye the Day? S. Will. I pledge ye, Nibour:—E'en but little Way: Rousted with Eild, a wee Piece Gate seems lang; Twa Miles or three's the maist that I dow gang. Sym. Ye're welcome here to stay all Night with me, And take sic Bed and Board as we can gi' ye. S. Will. That's kind unsought.—Well, gin ye have a Bairn That ye like well, and wad his Fortune learn, I shall employ the farthest of my Skill, To spae it faithfully, be't good or ill. Symon pointing to Patie. Only that Lad;—alake! I have nae mae, Either to make me joyful now, or wae. S. Will. Young Man, let's see your Hand;—what gars ye sneer? Pat. Because your Skill's but little worth I fear. S. Will. Ye cut before the Point.—But, Billy, bide, I'll wager there's a Mouse Mark on your Side. Els. Betooch-us-to! and well I wat that's true: Awa, awa! the Deil's o'er grit wi' you. Four Inch aneath his Oxter is the Mark, Scarce ever seen since he first wore a Sark. S. Will. I'll tell ye mair, if this young Lad be spar'd But a short while, he'll be a braw rich Laird. Elsp. A Laird!—Hear ye, Goodman! What think ye now? Sym. I dinna ken: Strange auld Man! What art thou? Fair fa' your Heart; 'tis good to bode of Wealth: Come turn the Timmer to Laird Patie's Health. Patie's Health gaes round. Pat. A Laird of twa good Whistles, and a Kent, Twa Curs, my trusty Tenants, on the Bent, Is all my great Estate—and like to be: Sae, cunning Carle, ne'er break your Jokes on me. Sym. Whisht, Patie,—let the Man look o'er your Hand, Aftimes as broken a Ship has come to Land. Sir William looks a little at Patie's Hand, then counterfeits falling into a Trance, while they endeavour to lay him right. Elsp. Preserve's! the Man's a Warlock, or possest With some nae good—or second Sight, at least: Where is he now?— Glaud. —He's seeing a' that's done In ilka Place, beneath or yont the Moon. Elsp. These second sighted Fowk, his Peace be here! See things far aff, and things to come, as clear As I can see my Thumb—Wow, can he tell (Speer at him, soon as he comes to himsell) How soon we'll see Sir William? Whisht, he heaves, And speaks out broken Words like ane that raves. Sym. He'll soon grow better;—Elspa, haste ye, gae, And fill him up a Tass of Usquebae. Sir William starts up, and speaks. A Knight that for a LYON fought, Against a Herd of Bears, Was to lang Toil and Trouble brought, In which some Thousands shares. But now again the LYON rares, And Joy spreads o'er the Plain: The LYON has defeat the Bears, The Knight returns again. That Knight, in a few Days, shall bring A Shepherd frae the Fauld, And shall present him to his King, A Subject true and bauld. He Mr. Patrick shall be call'd: All you that hear me now, May well believe what I have tald; For it shall happen true. Sym. Friend, may your Spaeing happen soon and weel; But, faith, I'm redd you've bargain'd with the Deil, To tell some Tales that Fowks wad secret keep: Or do ye get them tald you in your Sleep? S. Will. Howe'er I get them, never fash your Beard; Nor come I to redd Fortunes for Reward: But I'll lay ten to ane with ony here, That all I prophesy shall soon appear. Sym. You prophesying Fowks are odd kind Men! They're here that ken, and here that disna ken, The wimpled Meaning of your unco Tale, Whilk soon will mak a Noise o'er Moor and Dale. Glaud. 'Tis nae sma' Sport to hear how Sym believes, And takes't for Gospel what the Spae-man gives Of flawing Fortunes, whilk he evens to Pate: But what we wish, we trow at ony Rate. S. Will. Whisht, doubtfu' Carle; for ere the Sun Has driven twice down to the Sea, What I have said ye shall see done In part, or nae mair credit me. Glaud. Well, be't sae, Friend, I shall say nathing mair; But I've twa sonsy Lasses young and fair, Plump ripe for Men: I wish ye cou'd foresee Sic Fortunes for them might prove Joy to me. S. Will. Nae mair thro' Secrets can I sift, Till Darkness black the Bent: I have but anes a day that Gift; Sae rest a while content. Sym. Elspa, cast on the Claith, fetch butt some Meat, And, of your best, gar this auld Stranger eat. S. Will. Delay a while your hospitable Care; I'd rather enjoy this Evening calm and fair, Around yon ruin'd Tower, to fetch a Walk With you, kind Friend, to have some private Talk. Sym. Soon as you please I'll answer your Desire:— And, Glaud, you'll take your Pipe beside the Fire; We'll but gae round the Place, and soon be back, Syne sup together, and tak our Pint, and crack. Glaud. I'll out a while, and see the young anes play. My Heart's still light, abeit my Locks be gray. Exeunt. SCENE III. Jenny pretends an Errand hame, Young Roger draps the rest, To whisper out his melting Flame, And thow his Lassie's Breast. Behind a Bush, well hid frae sight, they meet: See Jenny's laughing; Roger's like to greet. Poor Shepherd! ROGER and JENNY. Rog. Dear Jenny, I wad speak to ye, wad ye let; And yet I ergh, ye're ay sae scornfu' set. Jen. And what would Roger say, if he could speak? Am I oblig'd to guess what ye're to seek. Rog. Yes, ye may guess right eith for what I grein, Baith by my Service, Sighs, and langing Een. And I maun out wi't, tho' I risk your Scorn; Ye're never frae my Thoughts baith Ev'n and Morn. Ah! cou'd I loo ye less, I'd happy be; But happier far, cou'd ye but fancy me. Jen. And wha kens, honest Lad, but that I may; Ye canna say that e'er I said ye nay. Rog. Alake! my frighted Heart begins to fail, When e'er I mint to tell ye out my Tale, For fear some tighter Lad, mair rich than I, Has win your Love, and near your Heart may ly. Jen. I loo my Father, Cousin Meg I love; But to this Day, nae Man my Mind could move: Except my Kin, ilk Lad's alike to me; And frae ye all I best had keep me free. Rog. How lang, dear Jenny?—Sayna that again; What Pleasure can ye tak in giving Pain? I'm glad, however, that ye yet stand free: Wha kens but ye may rue, and pity me? Jen. Ye have my Pity else, to see ye set On that whilk makes our Sweetness soon foryet. Wow! but we're bonny, good, and every thing; How sweet we breathe, when e'er we kiss, or sing! But we're nae sooner Fools to give Consent, Than we our Daffine and tint Power repent: When prison'd in four Waws, a Wife right tame, Altho' the first, the greatest Drudge at hame. Rog. That only happens, when for sake of Gear, Ane wales a Wife, as he wad buy a Mear; Or when dull Parents Bairns together bind Of different Tempers, that can ne'er prove kind. But Love, true downright Love, engages me, Tho' thou should scorn,—still to delight in thee. Jen. What suggar'd Words frae Woers Lips can fa'! But girning Marriage comes and ends them a'. I've seen with shining Fair the Morning rise, And soon the sleety Clouds mirk a' the Skies. I've seen the Silver Spring a while rin clear, And soon in Mossy Puddles disappear. Ths Bridegroom may rejoice, the Bride may smile; But soon Contentions a' their Joys beguile. Rog. I've seen the Morning rise with fairest Light, The Day unclouded sink in calmest Night. I've seen the Spring rin wimpling thro' the Plain, Increase and join the Ocean without Stain. The Bridegroom may be blyth, the Bride may smile; Rejoice thro' Life, and all your Fears beguile. Jen. Were I but sure you lang wou'd Love maintain, The fewest Words my easy Heart could gain: For I maun own, since now at last you're free, Altho' I jok'd, I lov'd your Company; And ever had a Warmness in my Breast, That made ye dearer to me than the rest. Rog. I'm happy now! o'er happy! had my Head!— This Gush of Pleasure's like to be my Dead. Come to my Arms! or strike me! I'm all fir'd With wondring Love! let's kiss till we be tir'd. Kiss, kiss! we'll kiss the Sun and Starns away, And ferly at the quick Return of Day! O Jenny! let my Arms about thee twine, And briss thy bonny Breasts and Lips to mine Jen. With equal Joy my easy Heart gi'es Way, To own thy well try'd Love has won the Day. Now by these warmest Kisses thou has tane, Swear thus to love me, when by Vows made ane. Rog. I swear by Fifty thousand yet to come, Or may the first ane strike me deaf and dumb, There shall not be a kindlier dawted Wife, If you agree with me to lead your Life. Jen. Well, I agree:—Neist, to my Parent gae, Get his Consent;—he'll hardly say ye nay. Ye have what will commend ye to him well, Auld Fowks like them that wants na Milk and Meal. Rog. My Faulds contain twice fifteen Forrow Nowt, As mony Newcal in my Byers rowt; Five Pack of Woo I can at Lammas sell, Shorn frae my bob-tail'd Bleeters on the Fell: Good twenty Pair of Blankets for our Bed, With meikle Care, my thrifty Mither made. Ilk thing that makes a heartsome House and tight, Was still her Care, my Father's great Delight. They left me all; which now gi'es Joy to me, Because I can give a', my Dear, to thee: And had I fifty times as meikle mair, Nane but my Jenny should the samen skair. My Love and All is yours; now had them fast, And guide them as ye like, to gar them last. Jen. I'll do my best—But see wha comes this Way, Patie and Meg;—besides, I mauna stay: Let's steal frae ither now, and meet the Morn; If we be seen, we'll drie a deal of Scorn. Rog. To where the Saugh-trees shades the Mennin-pool, I'll frae the Hill come down, when Day grows cool: Keep Triste, and meet me there;—there let us meet, To kiss, and tell our Love;—there's nought sae sweet. SCENE IV. This Scene presents the Knight and Sym Within a Gallery of the Place, Where all looks ruinous and grim; Nor has the Baron shown his Face, But joking with his Shepherd leel, Aft speers the Gate he kens fu' well. Sir WILLIAM and SYMON. S. Will. To whom belongs this House so much decay'd? Sym. To ane that lost it, lending generous Aid, To bear the Head up, when rebellious Tail Against the Laws of Nature did prevail. Sir William Worthy is our Master's Name, Whilk fills us all with Joy, now He's come hame. (Sir William draps his masking Beard, Symon transported sees The welcome Knight, with fond Regard, And grasps him round the Knees.) My Master! my dear Master!—do I breathe, To see him healthy, strong, and free frae Skaith; Return'd to chear his wishing Tenants Sight, To bless his Son, my Charge, the World's Delight! S. Will. Rise, faithful Symon; in my Arms enjoy A Place, thy Due, kind Guardian of my Boy: I came to view thy Care in this Disguise, And am confirm'd thy Conduct has been wise; Since still the Secret thou'st securely seal'd, And ne'er to him his real Birth reveal'd. Sym. The due Obedience to your strict Command Was the first Lock;—neist, my ain Judgment fand Out Reasons plenty: Since, without Estate, A Youth, tho' sprung frae Kings, looks baugh and blate. S. Will. And aften vain and idly spend their Time, 'Till grown unfit for Action, past their Prime, Hang on their Friends—which gie's their Sauls a cast, That turns them downright Beggars at the last. Sym. Now well I wat, Sir, ye have spoken true; For there's Laird Kytie's Son, that's loo'd by few: His Father steght his Fortune in his Wame, And left his Heir nought but a gentle Name. He gangs about sornan frae Place to Place, As scrimp of Manners, as of Sense and Grace; Oppressing all as Punishment of their Sin, That are within his tenth Degree of Kin: Rins in ilk Trader's Debt, wha's sae unjust To his ain Fam'ly, as to give him trust. S. Will. Such useless Branches of a Common-wealth, Should be lopt off, to give a State mair Health. Unworthy bare Reflection.—Symon, run O'er all your Observations on my Son; A Parent's Fondness easily finds Excuse: But do not with Indulgence Truth abuse. Sym. To speak his Praise, the langest Simmer Day Wad be o'er short,—cou'd I them right display. In Word and Deed he can sae well behave, That out of Sight he runs before the lave; And when there's e'er a Quarrel or Contest, Patrick's made Judge to tell whase Cause is best; And his Decreet stands good;—he'll gar it stand: Wha dares to grumble, finds his correcting Hand; With a firm Look, and a commanding Way, He gars the proudest of our Herds obey. S. Will. Your Tale much pleases;—my good Friend, proceed: What Learning has he? Can he write and read? Sym. Baith wonder well; for, troth, I didna spare To gi'e him at the School enough of Lair; And he delites in Books:—He reads, and speaks With Fowks that ken them, Latin Words and Greeks. S. Will. Where gets he Books to read?—and of what kind? Tho' some give Light, some blindly lead the Blind. Sym. Whene'er he drives our Sheep to Edinburgh Port, He buys some Books of History, Sangs or Sport: Nor does he want of them a Rowth at will, And carries ay a Poutchfu' to the Hill. About ane Shakspear, and a famous Ben, He aften speaks, and ca's them best of Men. How sweetly Hawthrenden and Stirling sing, And ane ca'd Cowley, loyal to his King, He kens fu' well, and gars their Verses ring. I sometimes thought he made o'er great a Frase, About fine Poems, Histories and Plays. When I reprov'd him anes,—a Book he brings, With this, quoth he, on Braes I crack with Kings. S. Will. He answer'd well; and much ye glad my Ear, When such Accounts I of my Shepherd hear. Reading such Books can raise a Peasant's Mind Above a Lord's that is not thus inclin'd. Sym. What ken we better, that sae sindle look, Except on rainy Sundays, on a Book; When we a Leaf or twa haff read haff spell, Till a' the rest sleep round, as well's our sell? S. Will. Well jested, Symon—But one Question more I'll only ask ye now, and then give o'er. The Youth's arriv'd the Age when little Loves Flighter around young Hearts like cooing Doves: Has nae young Lassie, with inviting Mien, And rosy Cheek, the Wonder of the Green, Engag'd his Look, and caught his youthfu' Heart? Sym. I fear'd the warst, but kend the smallest Part, Till late I saw him twa three times mair sweet, With Glaud's fair Neice, than I thought right or meet: I had my Fears; but now have nought to fear, Since like your sell your Son will soon appear. A Gentleman, enrich'd with all these Charms, May bless the fairest best born Lady's Arms. S. Will. This Night must end his unambitious Fire, When higher Views shall greater Thoughts inspire. Go, Symon, bring him quickly here to me; None but your self shall our first Meeting see. Yonder's my Horse and Servants nigh at hand, They come just at the Time I gave Command; Straight in my own Apparel I'll go dress: Now ye the Secret may to all confess. Sym. With how much Joy I on this Errand flee! There's nane can know, that is not downright me. Exit Symon. Sir William solus. When the Event of Hopes successfully appears, One happy Hour cancells the Toil of Years. A thousand Toils are lost in Lethe's Stream, And Cares evanish like a Morning Dream; When wish'd for Pleasures rise like Morning Light, The Pain that's past enhanses the Delight. These Joys I feel that Words can ill express, I ne'er had known without my late Distress. But from his rustick Business and Love, I must in haste my Patrick soon remove, To Courts and Camps that may his Soul improve. Like the rough Diamond, as it leaves the Mine, Only in little Breakings shew its Light, Till artfu' Polishing has made it shine: Thus Education makes the Genius bright. End of the Third ACT. ACT IV. SCENE I. The Scene describ'd in former Page, Glaud's Onset.—Enter Mause and Madge. Maus. Our Laird's come hame! and owns young Pate his Heir! That's News indeed!— Mad. —As true as ye stand there. As they were dancing all in Symon's Yard, Sir William, like a Warlock, with a Beard Five Nives in Length, and white as driven Snaw, Amang us came, cry'd, Had ye merry a'. We ferly'd meikle at his unco Look, While frae his Pouch he whirled forth a Book. As we stood round about him on the Green, He view'd us a', but fix'd on Pate his Een; Then pawkily pretended he cou'd spae, Yet for his Pains and Skill wad nathing ha'e. Maus. Then sure the Lasses, and ilk gaping Coof, Wad rin about him, and had out their Loof. Mad. As fast as Flaes skip to the Tate of Woo, Whilk slee Tod Lawrie hads without his Mow, When he to drown them, and his Hips to cool, In Simmer Days slides backward in a Pool: In short he did, for Pate, braw things fortell, Without the Help of Conjuring or Spell. At last, when well diverted, he withdrew, Pow'd aff his Beard to Symon, Symon knew His welcome Master;—round his Knees he gat, Hang at his Coat, and syne for Blythness grat. Patrick was sent for;—happy Lad is he! Symon tald Elspa, Elspa tald it me. Ye'll hear out a' the secret Story soon; And troth 'tis e'en right odd when a' is done, To think how Symon ne'er afore wad tell, Na, no sae meikle as to Pate himsell. Our Meg, poor thing, alake! has lost her Jo. Maus. It may be sae; wha kens? and may be no. To lift a Love that's rooted, is great Pain; Even Kings have tane a Queen out of the Plain: And what has been before, may be again. Mad. Sic Nonsense! Love tak root, but Tocher-good, 'Tween a Herd's Bairn, and ane of gentle Blood: Sic Fashions in King Bruce's Days might be; But siccan Ferlies now we never see. Maus. Gif Pate forsakes her, Bauldy she may gain; Yonder he comes, and wow but he looks fain! Nae doubt he thinks that Peggy's now his ain. Mad. He get her! slaverin Doof; it sets him weil To yoke a Plough where Patrick thought to till. Gif I were Meg, I'd let young Master see— Maus. Ye'd be as dorty in your Choice as he: And so wad I. But whisht, here Bauldy comes. Enter Bauldy singing. Jenny said to Jocky, Gin ye winna tell, Ye shall be the Lad, I'll be the Lass my sell; Ye're a bonny Lad, and I'm a Lassie free; Ye're welcomer to tak me than to let me be. I trow sae.—Lasses will come too at last, Tho' for a while they maun their Snaw-ba's cast. Maus. Well, Bauldy, how gaes a'?— Bauld. —Faith unco right: I hope we'll a' sleep sound but ane this Night. Mad. And wha's the unlucky ane, if we may ask? Bauld. To find out that, is nae difficult Task; Poor bonny Peggy, wha maun think nae mair On Pate, turn'd Patrick, and Sir William's Heir. Now, now, good Madge, and honest Mause, stand be, While Meg's in dumps, put in a Word for me. I'll be as kind as ever Pate could prove; Less wilful, and ay constant in my Love. Mad. As Neps can witness, and the Bushy Thorn, Where mony a Time to her your Heart was sworn: Fy! Bauldy, blush, and Vows of Love regard; What other Lass will trow a mansworn Herd? The Curse of Heaven hings ay aboon their Heads, That's ever guilty of sic sinfu' Deeds. I'll ne'er advise my Niece sae gray a Gate; Nor will she be advis'd, fu' well I wate. Bauld. Sae gray a Gate! Mansworn! and a' the rest: Ye leed, auld Roudes—and, in Faith, had best Eat in your Words; else I shall gar ye stand With a het Face afore the haly Band. Mad. Ye'll gar me stand! ye sheveling-gabit Brock; Speak that again, and, trembling, dread my Rock, And ten sharp Nails, that when my Hands are in, Can flyp the Skin o' ye'r Cheeks out o'er your Chin. Bauld. I tak ye Witness, Mause, ye heard her say, That I'm mansworn:—I winna let it gae. Mad. Ye're Witness to, he ca'd me bonny Names, And should be serv'd as his good Breeding claims. Ye filthy Dog!— Flees to his Hair like a Fury.—A stout Battle.— Mause endeavours to redd them. Maus. Let gang your Grips, fy, Madge! howt, Bauldy leen: I wadna wish this Tulzie had been seen; 'Tis sae daft like.— Bauldy gets out of Madge's Clutches with a bleeding Nose. Mad. —'Tis dafter like to thole An Ether-cap, like him, to blaw the Coal: It sets him well, with vile unscrapit Tongue, To cast up whether I be auld or young; They're aulder yet than I have married been, And or they died their Bairns Bairns have seen. Maus. That's true; and Bauldy ye was far to blame, To ca' Madge ought but her ain christen'd Name. Bauld. My Lugs, my Nose, and Nodle finds the same. Mad. Auld Roudes! Filthy Fallow; I shall auld ye. Maus. Howt no!—ye'll e'en be Friends with honest Bauldy. Come, come, shake Hands; this maun nae farder gae: Ye maun forgi'e 'm. I see the Lad looks wae. Bauld. In troth now, Mause, I have at Madge nae Spite; But she abusing first, was a' the Wite Of what has happen'd: And should therefore crave My Pardon first, and shall Acquittance have. Mad. I crave your Pardon! Gallows-face, gae greet, And own your Faut to her that ye wad cheat, Gae, or be blasted in your Health and Gear, 'Till ye learn to perform, as well as swear. Vow, and lowp back!—Was e'er the like heard tell? Swith, tak him Deil; he's o'er lang out of Hell. Bauldy running off. His Presence be about us! Curst were he That were condemn'd for Life to live with thee. Exit Bauldy. Madge laughing. I think I've towzl'd his Harigalds a wee; He'll no soon grein to tell his Love to me. He's but a Rascal that wad mint to serve A Lassie sae, he does but ill deserve. Maus. Ye towin'd him tightly,—I commend ye for't; His blooding Snout gave me nae little Sport: For this Forenoon he had that Scant of Grace, And Breeding baith,—to tell me to my Face, He hop'd I was a Witch, and wadna stand, To lend him in this Case my helping Hand. Mad. A Witch!—How had ye Patience this to bear, And leave him Een to see, or Lugs to hear? Maus. Auld wither'd Hands, and feeble Joints like mine, Obliges Fowk Resentment to decline; Till aft 'tis seen, when Vigour fails, then we With Cunning can the Lake of Pith supplie. Thus I pat aff Revenge till it was dark, Syne bade him come, and we should gang to wark: I'm sure he'll keep his Triste; and I came here To seek your Help, that we the Fool may fear. Mad. And special Sport we'll have, as I protest; Ye'll be the Witch, and I shall play the Ghaist, A Linen Sheet wond round me like ane dead, I'll cawk my Face, and grane, and shake my Head. We'll fleg him sae, he'll mint nae mair to gang A conjuring, to do a Lassie wrang. Maus. Then let us go; for see, 'tis hard on Night, The Westlin Cloud shines red with setting Light. Exeunt. SCENE II. When Birds begin to nod upon the Bough, And the Green Swaird grows damp with falling Dew, While good Sir William is to rest retir'd, The Gentle Shepherd tenderly inspir'd, Walks through the Broom with Roger ever leel, To meet, to comfort Meg, and tak Farewell. Rog. Wow! but I'm cadgie, and my Heart lowps light, O, Mr. Patrick! ay your Thoughts were right: Sure Gentle Fowk are farther seen than we, That naithing ha'e to brag of Pedigree. My Jenny now, wha brak my Heart this Morn, Is perfect yielding,—sweet,—and nae mair Scorn. I spake my Mind—she heard—I spake again, She smil'd—I kiss'd—I woo'd, nor woo'd in vain. Pat. I'm glad to hear't—But O my Change this Day Heaves up my Joy, and yet I'm sometimes wae. I've found a Father, gently kind as brave, And an Estate that lifts me 'boon the lave. With Looks all Kindness, Words that Love confest; He all the Father to my Soul exprest, While close he held me to his manly Breast. Such were the Eyes, he said, thus smil'd the Mouth Of thy lov'd Mother, Blessing of my Youth; Who set too soon!—And while he Praise bestow'd, Adown his graceful Cheek a Torrent flow'd. My new-born Joys, and this his tender Tale, Did, mingled thus, o'er a' my Thoughts prevail: That speechless lang, my late kend Sire I view'd, While gushing Tears my panting Breast bedew'd. Unusual Transports made my Head turn round, Whilst I my self with rising Raptures found The happy Son of ane sae much renown'd. But he has heard!—too faithful Symon's Fear Has brought my Love for Peggy to his Ear: Which he forbids.—Ah! this confounds my Peace, While thus to beat, my Heart shall sooner cease. Rog. How to advise ye, troth I'm at a stand: But were't my Case, ye'd clear it up aff hand. Pat. Duty, and haflen Reason plead his Cause: But what cares Love for Reason, Rules and Laws? Still in my Heart my Shepherdess excells, And Part of my new Happiness repells. Rog. Enjoy them baith.—Sir William will be won: Your Peggy's bonny;—you're his only Son. Pat. She's mine by Vows, and stronger Ties of Love; And frae these Bands nae Change my Mind shall move. I'll wed nane else; thro' Life I will be true: But still Obedience is a Parent's Due. Rog. Is not our Master and your sell to stay Amang us here?—or are ye gawn away To London Court, or ither far aff Parts, To leave your ain poor us with broken Hearts? Pat. To Edinburgh straight to-morrow we advance, To London neist, and afterwards to France, Where I must stay some Years, and learn—to dance, And twa three other Monky-tricks.—That done, I come hame struting in my red-heel'd Shoon. Then 'tis design'd, when I can well behave, That I maun be some petted Thing's dull Slave, For some few Bags of Cash, that I wat weel I nae mair need nor Carts do a third Wheel. But Peggy, dearer to me than my Breath, Sooner than hear sic News, shall hear my Death. Rog. They wha have just enough, can soundly sleep; The O'ercome only fashes Fowk to keep.— Good Mr. Patrick, tak your ain Tale hame. Pat. What was my Morning Thought, at Night's the same. The Poor and Rich but differ in the Name. Content's the greatest Bliss we can procure Frae 'boon the Lift.—Without it Kings are poor. Rog. But an Estate like your's yields braw Content, When we but pick it scantly on the Bent: Fine Claiths, saft Beds, sweet Houses, and red Wine, Good Chear, and witty Friends, whene'er ye dine; Obeysant Servants, Honour, Wealth and Ease: Wha's no content with these, are ill to please. Pat. Sae Roger thinks, and thinks not far amiss; But mony a Cloud hings hovering o'er the Bliss. The Passions rule the Roast;—and, if they're sowr, Like the lean Ky, will soon the fat devour. The Spleen, tint Honour, and affronted Pride, Stang like the sharpest Goads in Gentry's Side, The Gouts and Gravels, and the ill Disease, Are frequentest with Fowk o'erlaid with Ease; While o'er the Moor the Shepherd, with less Care, Enjoys his sober Wish, and halesome Air. Rog. Lord, Man! I wonder ay, and it delights My Heart, whene'er I hearken to your Flights. How gat ye a' that Sense, I fain wad lear, That I may easier Disappointments bear. Pate. Frae Books, the Wale of Books, I gat some Skill; These best can teach what's real good and ill. Ne'er grudge ilk Year to ware some Stanes of Cheese, To gain these silent Friends that ever please. Rog. I'll do't, and ye shall tell me which to buy: Faith I'se ha'e Books, tho' I should sell my Ky. But now let's hear how you're design'd to move, Between Sir William's Will, and Peggy's Love. Pat. Then here it lyes;—His Will maun be obey'd; My Vows I'll keep, and she shall be my Bride: But I some time this last Design maun hide. Keep you the Secret close, and leave me here; I sent for Peggy, yonder comes my Dear. Rog. Pleas'd that ye trust me with the Secret, I To wyle it frae me a' the Deils defy. Exit Roger. Patie solus. With what a Struggle must I now impart My Father's Will to her that hads my Heart! I ken she loves, and her saft Saul will sink, While it stands trembling on the hated Brink Of Disappointment.—Heaven! support my Fair, And let her Comfort claim your tender Care. Her Eyes are red!— Enter Peggy. —My Peggy, why in Tears? Smile as ye wont, allow nae Room for Fears: Tho' I'm nae mair a Shepherd, yet I'm thine. Peg. I dare not think sae high: I now repine At the unhappy Chance, that made not me A gentle Match, or still a Herd kept thee. Wha can, withoutten Pain, see frae the Coast The Ship that bears his All like to be lost? Like to be carry'd, by some Rever's Hand, Far frae his Wishes, to some distant Land? Pat. Ne'er quarrel Fate, whilst it with me remains, To raise thee up, or still attend these Plains. My Father has forbid our Loves, I own: But Love's superior to a Parent's Frown. I Falshood hate: Come, kiss thy Cares away; I ken to love, as well as to obey. Sir William's generous; leave the Task to me, To make strict Duty and true Love agree. Peg. Speak on!—speak ever thus, and still my Grief; But short I dare to hope the fond Relief. New Thoughts a gentler Face will soon inspire, That with nice Air swims round in Silk Attire: Then I, poor me!—with Sighs may ban my Fate, When the young Laird's nae mair my heartsome Pate; Nae mair again to hear sweet Tales exprest, By the blyth Shepherd that excell'd the rest: Nae mair be envy'd by the tattling Gang, When Patie kiss'd me, when I danc'd or sang: Nae mair, alake! we'll on the Meadow play! And rin haff breathless round the Rucks of Hay; As aftimes I have fled from thee right fain, And fawn on purpose, that I might be tane. Nae mair around the Foggy-know I'll creep, To watch and stare upon thee, while asleep. But hear my Vow—'twill help to give me Ease; May sudden Death, or deadly sair Disease, And warst of Ills attend my wretched Life, If e'er to ane, but you, I be a Wife. Pat. Sure Heaven approves—and be assur'd of me, I'll ne'er gang back of what I've sworn to thee: And Time, tho' Time maun interpose a while, And I maun leave my Peggy and this Isle; Yet Time, nor Distance, nor the fairest Face, If there's a fairer, e'er shall fill thy Place. I'd hate my rising Fortune, should it move The fair Foundation of our faithful Love. If at my Foot were Crowns and Scepters laid, To bribe my Soul frae thee, delightful Maid; For thee I'd soon leave these inferior Things To sic as have the Patience to be Kings. Wherefore that Tear? Believe, and calm thy Mind. Peg. I greet for Joy, to hear thy Words sae kind. When Hopes were sunk, and nought but mirk Despair Made me think Life was little worth my Care, My Heart was like to burst; but now I see Thy generous Thoughts will save thy Love for me. With Patience then I'll wait each wheeling Year, Hope Time away, till thou with Joy appear; And all the while I'll study gentler Charms, To make me fitter for my Traveller's Arms: I'll gain on Uncle Glaud,—he's far frae Fool, And will not grudge to put me thro' ilk School; Where I may Manners learn— Pat. —That's wisely said, And what he wares that Way shall be well paid. Tho' without a' the little Helps of Art, Thy native Sweets might gain a Prince's Heart: Yet now, lest in our Station, we offend, We must learn Modes, to Innocence unkend; Affect aftimes to like the thing we hate, And drap Serenity, to keep up State: Laugh, when we're sad; speak, when we've nought to say; And, for the Fashion, when we're blyth, seem wae: Pay Compliments to them we aft have scorn'd; Then scandalize them, when their Backs are turn'd. Peg. If this is Gentry, I had rather be What I am still—But I'll be ought with thee. Pat. No, no, my Peggy, I but only jest With Gentry's Apes; for still amangst the best, Good Manners give Integrity a Bleez, When native Vertues join the Arts to please. Peg. Since with nae hazard, and sae small Expence, My Lad frae Books can gather siccan Sense; Then why, ah! why should the tempestuous Sea, Endanger thy dear Life, and frighten me? Sir William's cruel, that wad force his Son, For Watna-whats, sae great a Risk to run. Pat. There is nae doubt, but travelling does improve, Yet I would shun it for thy Sake, my Love. But soon as I've shook aff my Landwart Cast, In foreign Cities, hame to thee I'll haste. Peg. With every setting Day, and rising Morn, I'll kneel to Heaven, and ask thy safe Return. Under that Tree, and on the Suckler Brae, Where aft we wont, when Bairns, to run and play; And to the Hissel-shaw where first ye vow'd Ye wad be mine, and I as eithly trow'd, I'll aften gang, and tell the Trees and Flowers, With Joy, that they'll bear Witness I am yours. Pat. My Dear, allow me, frae thy Temples fair, A shining Ringlet of thy flowing Hair; Which, as a Sample of each lovely Charm, I'll aften kiss, and wear about my Arm. Peg. Were't in my Power with better Boons to please, I'd give the best I could with the same Ease; Nor wad I, if thy Luck had faln to me, Been in ae Jot less generous to thee. Pat. I doubt it not; but since we've little Time To ware't on Words, wad border on a Crime: Love's safter Meaning better is exprest, When 'tis with Kisses on the Heart imprest. Exeunt. End of the Fourth ACT. ACT V. SCENE I. See how poor Bauldy stares like ane possest, And roars up Symon frae his kindly Rest. Bare leg'd, with Night-cap, and unbutton'd Coat, See, the auld Man comes forward to the Sot. Sym. What want ye, Bauldy, at this early Hour, While drowsy Sleep keeps a' beneath its Pow'r? Far to the North, the scant approaching Light Stands equal 'twixt the Morning and the Night. What gars ye shake and glowr, and look sae wan? Your Teeth they chitter, Hair like Bristles stand. Baul. O len me soon some Water, Milk or Ale, My Head's grown giddy,—Legs with shaking fail; I'll ne'er dare venture forth at Night my lane: Alake! I'll never be my sell again. I'll ne'er o'erput it! Symon! O Symon! O! Symon gives him a Drink. Sym. What ails thee, Gowk!—to make sae loud ado? You've wak'd Sir William, he has left his Bed; He comes, I fear ill pleas'd: I hear his Tred. Enter Sir William. S. Will. How goes the Night? Does Day-light yet appear? Symon, you're very timeously asteer. Sym. I'm sorry, Sir, that we've disturb'd your Rest: But some strange thing has Bauldy's Sp'rit opprest; He's seen some Witch, or wrestl'd with a Ghaist. Baul. O ay,—dear Sir, in troth 'tis very true; And I am come to make my Plaint to you. Sir William smiling. I lang to hear't— Baul. —Ah! Sir, the Witch ca'd Mause, That wins aboon the Mill amang the Haws, First promis'd that she'd help me with her Art, To gain a bonny thrawart Lassie's Heart. As she had tristed, I met wi'er this Night; But may nae Friend of mine get sic a Fright! For the curs'd Hag, instead of doing me good, (The very Thought o't's like to freeze my Blood!) Rais'd up a Ghaist or Diel, I kenna whilk, Like a dead Corse in Sheet as white as Milk, Black Hands it had, and Face as wan as Death, Upon me fast the Witch and it fell baith, And gat me down; while I, like a great Fool, Was laboured as I wont to be at School. My Heart out of its Hool was like to lowp; I pithless grew with Fear, and had nae Hope, Till, with an Elritch Laugh, they vanish'd quite: Syne I, haff dead with Anger, Fear and Spite, Crap up, and fled straight frae them, Sir, to you, Hoping your Help, to gi'e the Deil his Due. I'm sure my Heart will ne'er gi'e o'er to dunt, Till in a fat Tar-barrel Mause be burnt. S. Will. Well, Bauldy, whate'er's just shall granted be; Let Mause be brought this Morning down to me. Baul. Thanks to your Honour; soon shall I obey: But first I'll Roger raise, and twa three mae, To catch her fast, or she get Leave to squeel, And cast her Cantraips that bring up the Deil. Exit Bauldy. S. Will. Troth, Symon, Bauldy's more afraid than hurt, The Witch and Ghaist have made themselves good Sport. What silly Notions crowd the clouded Mind, That is thro' want of Education blind! Sym. But does your Honour think there's nae sic thing As Witches raising Diels up thro' a Ring? Syne playing Tricks, a thousand I cou'd tell, Cou'd never be contriv'd on this Side Hell. S. Will. Such as the Devil's dancing in a Moor Amongst a few old Women craz'd and poor, Who are rejoic'd to see him frisk and lowp O'er Braes and Bogs, with Candles in his Dowp; Appearing sometimes like a black-horn'd Cow, Aftimes like Bawty, Badrans, or a Sow: Then with his Train thro' airy Paths to glide, While they on Cats, or Clowns, or Broom-staffs ride; Or in the Egg-shell skim out o'er the Main, To drink their Leader's Health in France or Spain: Then aft by Night, bumbaze Hare-hearted Fools, By tumbling down their Cup-board, Chairs and Stools. Whate'er's in Spells, or if there Witches be, Such Whimsies seem the most absurd to me. Sym. 'Tis true enough, we ne'er heard that a Witch Had either meikle Sense, or yet was rich. But Mause, tho' poor, is a sagacious Wife, And lives a quiet and very honest Life; That gars me think this Hobleshew that's past Will land in naithing but a Joke at last. S. Will. I'm sure it will:—But see increasing Light Commands the Imps of Darkness down to Night; Bid raise my Servants, and my Horse prepare, Whilst I walk out to take the Morning Air. Exeunt. SCENE II. While Peggy laces up her Bosom fair, With a blew Snood Jenny binds up her Hair; Glaud by his Morning Ingle takes a Beek, The rising Sun shines motty thro' the Reek, A Pipe his Mouth; the Lasses please his Een, And now and than his Joke maun interveen. Glaud. I wish, my Bairns, it may keep fair till Night; Ye do not use sae soon to see the Light. Nae doubt now ye intend to mix the thrang, To take your Leave of Patrick or he gang. But do ye think that now when he's a Laird, That he poor Landwart Lasses will regard? Jen. Tho' he's young Master now, I'm very sure He has mair Sense than slight auld Friends, tho' poor. But yesterday he ga'e us mony a Tug, And kiss'd my Cousin there frae Lug to Lug. Glaud. Ay, ay, nae doubt o't, and he'll do't again; But, be advis'd, his Company refrain: Before he, as a Shepherd, sought a Wife, With her to live a chast and frugal Life; But now grown gentle, soon he will forsake Sic godly Thoughts, and brag of being a Rake. Peg. A Rake!—What's that?—Sure if it means ought ill, He'll never be't; else I have tint my Skill. Glaud. Daft Lassie, ye ken nought of the Affair, Ane young and good and gentle's unco' rare. A Rake's a graceless Spark, that thinks nae Shame, To do what like of us thinks Sin to name: Sic are sae void of Shame, they'll never stap To brag how aften they have had the Clap. They'll tempt young Things, like you, with Youdith flush'd, Syne make ye a' their Jest, when ye're debauch'd. Be warry then, I say, and never gi'e Encouragement, or bourd with sic as he. Peg. Sir William's vertuous, and of gentle Blood; And may not Patrick too, like him, be good? Glaud. That's true, and mony Gentry mae than he, As they are wiser, better are than we; But thinner sawn: They're sae puft up with Pride, There's mony of them mocks ilk haly Guide, That shaws the Gate to Heaven.—I've heard my sell, Some of them laugh at Doomsday, Sin and Hell. Jen. Watch o'er us, Father! Heh! that's very odd; Sure him that doubts a Doomsday, doubts a GOD. Glaud. Doubt! why, they neither doubt, nor judge, nor think, Nor hope, nor fear; but curse, debauch and drink: But I'm no saying this, as if I thought That Patrick to sic Gates will e'er be brought. Peg. The LORD forbid! Na, he kens better things: But here comes Aunt; her Face some Ferly brings. Enter Madge. Haste, haste ye; we're a' sent for o'er the Gate, To hear, and help to redd some odd Debate 'Tween Mause and Bauldy, 'bout some Witchcraft Spell, At Symon's House: The Knight sits Judge himsell. Glaud. Lend me my Staff;—Madge, lock the Outer-door, And bring the Lasses wi' ye; I'll step before. Exit Glaud. Mad. Poor Meg!—Look, Jenny, was the like e'er seen, How bleer'd and red with greeting look her Een? This Day her brankan Wooer takes his Horse. To strute a gentle Spark at Edinburgh Cross; To change his Kent, cut frae the branchy Plain, For a nice Sword, and glancing headed Cane; To leave his Ram-horn Spoons, and kitted Whey, For gentler Tea, that smells like new won Hay; To leave the Green-swaird Dance, when we gae Milk, To rustle amang the Beauties clad in Silk. But Meg, poor Meg! maun with the Shepherd stay, And tak what GOD will send, in Hodden-gray. Peg. Dear Aunt, what need ye fash us wi' your Scorn? That's no my Faut that I'm nae gentler born. Gif I the Daughter of some Laird had been, I ne'er had notic'd Patie on the Green: Now since he rises, why should I repine? If he's made for another, he'll ne'er be mine: And then, the like has been, if the Decree Designs him mine, I yet his Wife may be. Mad. A bonny Story, trowth!—But we delay: Prin up your Aprons baith, and come away. Exeunt. SCENE III. Sir William fills the twa-arm'd Chair, While Symon, Roger, Glaud and Mause, Attend, and with loud Laughter hear Daft Bauldy bluntly plead his Cause: For now 'tis tell'd him that the Taz Was handled by revengefu' Madge, Because he brak good Breeding's Laws, And with his Nonsense rais'd their Rage. S. Will. And was that all? Well, Bauldy, ye was serv'd No otherwise than what ye well deserv'd. Was it so small a Matter, to defame, And thus abuse an honest Woman's Name? Besides your going about to have betray'd By Perjury an innocent young Maid. Baul. Sir, I confess my Faut thro' a' the Steps, And ne'er again shall be untrue to Neps. Maus. Thus far, Sir, he oblig'd me on the Score; I kend not that they thought me sic before. Baul. An't like your Honour, I believ'd it well; But trowth I was e'en doilt to seek the Deil: Yet, with your Honour's Leave, tho' she's nae Witch, She's baith a slee and a revengefu'— And that my Some-place finds; but I had best Had in my Tongue; for yonder comes the Ghaist, And the young bonny Witch, whase rosy Cheek Sent me, without my Wit, the Deil to seek. Enter Madge, Peggy, and Jenny. Sir William, looking at Peggy. Whose Daughter's she that wears th'Aurora Gown, With Face so fair, and Locks a lovely brown? How sparkling are her Eyes! What's this! I find The Girl brings all my Sister to my Mind. Such were the Features once adorn'd a Face, Which Death too soon depriv'd of sweetest Grace. Is this your Daughter, Glaud?— Glaud. —Sir, she's my Niece;— And yet she's not:—But I should hald my Peace. S. Will. This is a Contradiction: What d'ye mean? She is, and is not! Pray thee, Glaud, explain. Glaud. Because I doubt, if I should make appear What I have kept a Secret thirteen Year. Mause. You may reveal what I can fully clear. S. Will. Speak soon; I'm all Impatience!— Pat. —So am I! For much I hope, and hardly yet know why. Glaud. Then, since my Master orders, I obey. This Bonny Fundling, ae clear Morn of May, Close by the Lee-side of my Door I found, All sweet and clean, and carefully hapt round, In Infant-weeds of rich and gentle Make. What cou'd they be, thought I, did thee forsake? Wha, warse than Brutes, cou'd leave expos'd to Air Sae much of Innocence sae sweetly fair, Sae hopeless young? For she appear'd to me Only about twa Towmands auld to be. I took her in my Arms, the Bairnie smil'd With sic a Look wad made a Savage mild. I hid the Story: She has past sincesyne As a poor Orphan, and a Niece of mine. Nor do I rue my Care about the We'an, For she's well worth the Pains that I have tane. Ye see she's bonny, I can swear she's good, And am right sure she's come of gentle Blood: Of whom I kenna.—Nathing ken I mair, Than what I to your Honour now declare. S. Will. This Tale seems strange!— Pat. —The Tale delights my Ear; S. Will. Command your Joys, young Man, till Truth appear. Maus. That be my Task.—Now, Sir, bid all be hush; Peggy may smile;—thou hast nae Cause to blush. Long have I wish'd to see this happy Day, That I might safely to the Truth give way; That I may now Sir William Worthy name, The best and nearest Friend that she can claim: He saw't at first, and with quick Eye did trace His Sister's Beauty in her Daughter's Face. S. Will. Old Woman, do not rave,—prove what you say; 'Tis dangerous in Affairs like this to play. Pat. What Reason, Sir, can an old Woman have To tell a Lie, when she's sae near her Grave? But how, or why, it should be Truth, I grant, I every thing looks like a Reason want. Omnes. The Story's odd! we wish we heard it out. S. Will. Mak haste, good Woman, and resolve each Doubt. Mause goes forward, leading Peggy to Sir William. Maus. Sir, view me well: Has fifteen Years so plow'd A wrinkled Face that you have often view'd, That here I as an unknown Stranger stand, Who nurs'd her Mother that now holds my Hand? Yet stronger Proofs I'll give, if you demand. S. Will. Ha! honest Nurse, where were my Eyes before! I know thy Faithfulness, and need no more; Yet, from the Lab'rinth to lead out my Mind, Say, to expose her who was so unkind. Sir William embraces Peggy, and makes her sit by him. Yes, surely thou'rt my Niece; Truth must prevail: But no more Words, till Mause relate her Tale. Pat. Good Nurse, go on; nae Musick's haff sae fine, Or can give Pleasure like these Words of thine. Maus. Then, it was I that sav'd her Infant-life, Her Death being threatned by an Uncle's Wife. The Story's lang; but I the Secret knew, How they pursu'd, with avaritious View, Her rich Estate, of which they're now possest: All this to me a Confident confest. I heard with Horror, and with trembling Dread, They'd smoor the sakeless Orphan in her Bed! That very Night, when all were sunk in Rest, At Midnight Hour, the Floor I saftly prest, And staw the sleeping Innocent away; With whom I travel'd some few Miles e'er Day: All Day I hid me,—when the Day was done, I kept my Journey, lighted by the Moon, Till Eastward fifty Miles I reach'd these Plains, Where needful Plenty glads your chearful Swains; Afraid of being found out, I to secure My Charge, e'en laid her at this Shepherd's Door, And took a neighbouring Cottage here, that I, Whate'er should happen to her, might be by. Here honest Glaud himsell, and Symon may Remember well, how I that very Day Frae Roger's Father took my little Crove. Glaud, with Tears of Joy happing down his Beard. I well remember't. Lord reward your Love: Lang have I wish'd for this; for aft I thought, Sic Knowledge sometime should about be brought. Pat. 'Tis now a Crime to doubt,—my Joys are full, With due Obedience to my Parent's Will. Sir, with paternal Love survey her Charms, And blame me not for rushing to her Arms. She's mine by Vows; and would, tho' still unknown, Have been my Wife, when I my Vows durst own. S. Will. My Niece, my Daughter, welcome to my Care, Sweet Image of thy Mother good and fair, Equal with Patrick: Now my greatest Aim Shall be, to aid your Joys, and well match'd Flame. My Boy, receive her from your Father's Hand, With as good Will as either would demand. Patie and Peggy embrace, and kneel to Sir William. Pat. With as much Joy this Blessing I receive, As ane wad Life, that's sinking in a Wave. Sir William raises them. I give you both my Blessing: May your Love Produce a happy Race, and still improve. Peg. My Wishes are compleat,—my Joys arise, While I'm haff dizzy with the blest Surprise. And am I then a Match for my ain Lad, That for me so much generous Kindness had? Lang may Sir William bless these happy Plains, Happy while Heaven grant he on them remains. Pat. Be lang our Guardian, still our Master be; We'll only crave what you shall please to gi'e: The Estate be your's, my Peggy's ane to me. Glaud. I hope your Honour now will take amends Of them that sought her Life for wicked Ends. S. Will. The base unnatural Villain soon shall know, That Eyes above watch the Affairs below. I'll strip him soon of all to her pertains, And make him reimburse his ill got Gains. Peg. To me the Views of Wealth and an Estate, Seem light when put in Ballance with my Pate: For his Sake only, I'll ay thankful bow For such a Kindness, best of Men, to you. Sym. What double Blythness wakens up this Day! I hope now, Sir, you'll no soon haste away. Sall I unsadle your Horse, and gar prepare A Dinner for ye of hale Country Fare? See how much Joy unwrinkles every Brow; Our Looks hing on the twa, and doat on you: Even Bauldy the Bewitch'd has quite forgot Fell Madge's Taz, and pawky Mause's Plot. S. Will. Kindly old Man, remain with you this Day, I never from these Fields again will stray: Masons and Wrights shall soon my House repair, And bussy Gardners shall new Planting rear; My Father's hearty Table you soon shall see Restor'd, and my best Friends rejoyce with me. Sym. That's the best News I heard this Twenty Year; New Day breaks up, rough Times begin to clear. Glaud. GOD save the King, and save Sir William lang, To enjoy their ain, and raise the Shepherds Sang. Rog. Wha winna dance? wha will refuse to sing? What Shepherd's Whistle winna lilt the Spring? Baul. I'm Friends with Mause,—with very Madge I'm 'greed, Altho' they skelpit me when woodly fleid: I'm now fu' blyth, and frankly can forgive, To join and sing, Lang may Sir William live. Mad. Lang may he live:—And, Bauldy, learn to steek Your Gab a wee, and think before ye speak; And never ca' her auld that wants a Man, Else ye may yet some Witches Fingers ban. This Day I'll wi' the youngest of ye rant, And brag for ay, that I was ca'd the Aunt Of our young Lady,—my dear bonny Bairn! Peg. No other Name I'll ever for you learn.— And, my good Nurse, how shall I gratefu' be, For a' thy matchless Kindness done for me? Maus. The flowing Pleasures of this happy Day Does fully all I can require repay. S. Will. To faithful Symon, and, kind Glaud, to you, And to your Heirs I give in endless Feu, The Mailens ye possess, as justly due, For acting like kind Fathers to the Pair, Who have enough besides, and these can spare. Mause, in my House in Calmness close your Days, With nought to do, but sing your Maker's Praise. Omnes. The Lord of Heaven return your Honour's Love, Confirm your Joys, and a' your Blessings roove. Patie, presenting Roger to Sir William. Sir, here's my trusty Friend, that always shar'd My Bosom-secrets, ere I was a Laird; Glaud's Daughter Janet (Jenny, thinkna Shame) Rais'd, and maintains in him a Lover's Flame: Lang was he dumb, at last he spake, and won, And hopes to be our honest Uncle's Son: Be pleas'd to speak to Glaud for his Consent, That nane may wear a Face of Discontent. S. Will. My Son's Demand is fair,—Glaud, let me crave, That trusty Roger may your Daughter have, With frank Consent; and while he does remain Upon these Fields, I make him Chamberlain. Glaud. You crowd your Bounties, Sir, what can we say, But that we're Dyvours that can ne'er repay? Whate'er your Honour wills, I shall obey. Roger, my Daughter, with my Blessing, take, And still our Master's Right your Business make, Please him, be faithful, and this auld gray Head Shall nod with Quietness down amang the Dead. Rog. I ne'er was good a speaking a' my Days, Or ever loo'd to make o'er great a Fraise: But for my Master, Father and my Wife, I will employ the Cares of all my Life. S. Will. My Friends, I'm satisfied you'll all behave, Each in his Station, as I'd wish or crave. Be ever vertuous, soon or late you'll find Reward, and Satisfaction to your Mind. The Maze of Life sometimes looks dark and wild; And oft when Hopes are highest, we're beguil'd. Aft, when we stand on Brinks of dark Despair, Some happy Turn with Joy dispells our Care. Now all's at Rights, who sings best let me hear. Peg. When you demand, I readiest should obey: I'll sing you ane, the newest that I ha'e. Sings to the Tune of Corn-riggs are bonny. My Patie is a Lover gay, His Mind is never muddy; His Breath is sweeter than new Hay, His Face is fair and ruddy: His Shape is handsome, middle Size; He's comely in his Wauking: The shining of his Een surprise; 'Tis Heaven to hear him tawking. Last Night I met him on a Bawk, Where yellow Corn was growing, There mony a kindly Word he spake, That set my Heart a glowing. He kiss'd, and vow'd he wad be mine, And loo'd me best of ony, That gars me like to sing since syne, O Corn-riggs are bonny. Let Lasses of a silly Mind Refuse what maist they're wanting; Since we for yielding were design'd, We chastly should be granting. Then I'll comply, and marry Pate, And syne my Cockernonny He's free to touzel air or late, Where Corn-riggs are bonny. Exeunt omnes. To Mrs. A. C. A Song. To the Tune of, All in the Downs. When Beauty blazes heavenly bright, The Muse can no more cease to sing, Than can the Lark, with rising Light, Her Notes neglect with drooping Wing. The Morning shines, harmonious Birds mount hy; The dawning Beauty smiles, and Poets fly. Young ANNIE's budding Graces claim The inspir'd Thought, and softest Lays; And kindle in the Breast a Flame, Which must be vented in her Praise. Tell us, ye gentle Shepherds, have you seen E'er one so like an Angel tread the Green. Ye Youth, be watchful of your Hearts; When she appears, take the Alarm: Love on her Beauty points his Darts, And wings an Arrow from each Charm. Around her Eyes and Smiles the Graces sport, And to her snowy Neck and Breasts resort. But vain must every Caution prove; When such enchanting Sweetness shines, The wounded Swain must yield to Love, And wonder, tho' he hopeless pines. Such Flames the foppish Butterfly shou'd shun; The Eagle's only fit to view the Sun. She's as the opening Lilly fair, Her lovely Features are compleat; Whilst Heaven indulgent makes her share With Angels all that's wise and sweet. These Vertues, which divinely deck her Mind, Exalt each Beauty of th'inferior Kind. Whether she love the rural Scenes, Or sparkle in the airy Town, O! happy he her Favour gains, Unhappy! if she on him frown. The Muse unwilling quits the lovely Theme, Adieu she sings, and thrice repeats her Name. To Mrs. E. C. A Song. To the Tune of Tweed-side. Now Phœbus advances on hy; No Footsteps of Winter are seen; The Birds carrol sweet in the Sky, And Lambkins dance Reels on the Green. Thro' Groves, and by Rivulets clear, We wander for Pleasure and Health, Where Buddings and Blossoms appear, Giving Prospects of Joy and Wealth. View every gay Scene all around, That are, and that promise to be; Yet in them all nothing is found So perfect, Elisa, as thee. Thine Eyes the clear Fountains excell; Thy Locks they out-rival the Grove; When Zephyrs these pleasingly swell, Each Wave makes a Captive to Love. The Roses and Lillies combin'd, And Flowers of most delicate Hue, By thy Cheek and thy Breasts are out-shin'd, Their Tinctures are nothing so true. What can we compare with thy Voice, And what with thy Humour so sweet? No Musick can bless with such Joys; Sure Angels are just so compleat, Fair Blossom of every Delight, Whose Beauties ten thousands out-shine, Thy Sweets shall be lastingly bright, Being mixt with so many divine. Ye Powers, who have given such Charms To Elisa, your Image below, O! save her from all humane Harms, And make her Hours happily flow. To CALISTA: A Song To the Tune of, I wish my Love were in a Mire. She sung,—the Youth Attention gave, And Charms on Charms espies; Then all in Raptures falls a Slave, Both to her Voice and Eyes. So spoke and smil'd the Eastern Maid, Like thine, seraphick were her Charms, That in Circassia's Vineyards stray'd, And blest the wisest Monarch's Arms. A thousand fair of high Desert Strave to enchant the amorous King, But the Circassian gain'd his Heart, And taught the Royal Bard to sing. Calista thus our Sang inspires, And claims the smooth and highest Lays; But while each Charm our Bosom fires, Words seem too few to sound her Praise. Her Mind, in ev'ry Grace compleat, To paint, surpasses humane Skill, Her Majesty, mixt with the sweet; Let Seraphs sing her if they will: Whilst wondring, with a ravish'd Eye, We all that's perfect in her view, Viewing a Sister of the Sky, To whom an Adoration's due. A SONG. [Farewell to Lochaber, and farewell, my Jean] Tune of Lochaber no more. Farewell to Lochaber, and farewell, my Jean, Where heartsome with thee I've mony Day been; For Lochaber no more, Lochaber no more. We'll may be return to Lochaber no more. These Tears that I shed, they are a' for my Dear, And no for the Dangers attending on Weir, Tho' bore on rough Seas to a far bloody Shore, May be to return to Lochaber no more. Tho' Hurrycanes rise, and rise ev'ry Wind, They'll ne'er make a Tempest like that in my Mind: Tho' loudest of Thunder on louder Waves roar, That's nathing like leaving my Love on the Shore. To leave thee behind me, my Heart is sair pain'd. By Ease that's inglorious no Fame can be gain'd; And Beauty and Love's the Reward of the Brave, And I must deserve it before I can crave. Then Glory, my Jeany, maun plead my Excuse; Since Honour commands me, how can I refuse? Without it I ne'er can have Merit for thee, And without thy Favour I'd better not be. I gae then, my Lass, to win Honour and Fame; And if I should luck to come gloriously hame, I'll bring a Heart to thee with Love running o'er, And then I'll leave thee and Lochaber no more. Lass with a Lump of Land. Gi'e me a Lass with a Lump of Land, And we for Life shall gang thegither; Tho' daft or wise I'll never demand, Or black or fair it maksna whether. I'm aff with Wit, and Beauty will fade, And Blood alane is no worth a Shilling; But she that's rich, her Market's made, For ilka Charm about her is killing. Gi'e me a Lass with a Lump of Land, And in my Bosom I'll hug my Treasure; Gin I had anes her Gear in my Hand, Shou'd Love turn dowf, it will find Pleasure. Laugh on wha likes, but there's my Hand, I hate with Poortith, tho' bonny, to meddle; Unless they bring Cash, or a Lump of Land, They'se never get me to dance to their Fiddle. There's meikle good Love in Bands and Bags, And Siller and Gowd's a sweet Complection; But Beauty, and Wit, and Vertue in Rags, Have tint the Art of gaining Affection. Love tips his Arrows with Woods and Parks, And Castles, and Riggs, and Moors, and Meadows; And nathing can catch our modern Sparks, But well tocher'd Lasses, or jointer'd Widows. Vertue and Wit. The Preservatives of Love and Beauty. To the Tune of Gillikranky. To Mrs. K. H. [HE.] Confess thy Love, fair blushing Maid; For since thine Eye's consenting, Thy safter Thoughts are a' betray'd, And Nasays no worth tenting. Why aims thou to oppose thy Mind, With Words thy Wish denying? Since Nature made thee to be kind, Reason allows complying. Nature and Reason's joint Consent Make Love a sacred Blessing; Then happily that Time is spent, That's war'd on kind caressing. Come then, my Katie, to my Arms, I'll be nae mair a Rover, But find out Heaven in a' thy Charms, And prove a faithful Lover. SHE. What you design by Nature's Law, Is fleeting Inclination; That Willy-Wisp bewilds us a', By its Infatuation. When that gaes out, Caresses tire, And Love's nae mair in season; Syne weakly we blaw up the Fire, With all our boasted Reason. HE. The Beauties of inferior Cast May start this just Reflection; But Charms like thine maun always last, Where Wit has the Protection. Vertue and Wit, like April Rays, Make Beauty rise the sweeter: The langer then on thee I gaze, My Love will grow compleater. SONG. [Adieu for a while, my native green Plains] To the Tune of, I'll gar ye be fain to follow me. HE. Adieu for a while, my native green Plains, My nearest Relations, and neighbouring Swains, Dear Nelly, frae these I'd start easily free, Were Minutes not Ages while absent frae thee. SHE. Then tell me the Reason thou does not obey The Pleadings of Love, but thus hurries away: Alake! thou Deceiver, o'er plainly I see, A Lover sae roving will never mind me. HE. The Reason unhappy is owing to Fate, That gave me a Being without an Estate, Which lays a Necessity now upon me, To purchase a Fortune for Pleasure to thee. SHE. Small Fortune may serve where Love has the Sway: Then, Johny, be counsel'd nae langer to stray; For while thou proves constant in Kindness to me, Contented I'll ay find a Treasure in thee. HE. O cease, my dear Charmer, else soon I'll betray A Weakness unmanly, and quickly give way To Fondness which may prove a Ruin to thee, A Pain to us baith, and Dishonour to me. Bear Witness, ye Streams, and witness, ye Flowers; Bear Witness, ye watchful invisible Powers, If ever my Heart be unfaithful to thee, May nathing propitious e'er smile upon me. SONG. [Ann I'll awa' to bonny Tweed-side] We'll a' to Kelso go. Ann I'll awa' to bonny Tweed-side, And see my Deary come throw, And he sall be mine Gif sae he incline; For I hate to lead Apes below. While young and fair, I'll make it my Care, To secure my sell in a Jo; I'm no sic a Fool, To let my Blood cool, And syne gae lead Apes below. Few Words, bonny Lad, Will eithly perswade, Tho' blushing, I daftly say no, Gae on with your Strain, And doubt not to gain; For I hate to lead Apes below. Unty'd to a Man, Do whate'er we can, We never can thrive or dow: Then I will do well, Do better wha will, And let them lead Apes below. Our Time is precious, And Gods are gracious, That Beauties upon us bestow; 'Tis not to be thought We got them for nought, Or to be set up for Show. 'Tis carry'd by Votes, Come kilt up your Coats, And let us to Edinburgh go, Where she that's bonny May catch a Johny, And never lead Apes below. The Widow. The Widow can bake, and the Widow can brew, The Widow can shape, and the Widow can shew, And mony braw Things the Widow can do; Then have at the Widow, my Laddie. With Courage attack her baith early and late, To kiss her and clap her ye mauna be blate: Speak well, and do better; for that's the best Gate To win a young Widow, my Laddie. The Widow she's youthfu', and never ae Hair The war of the wearing, and has a good Skair Of every thing lovely; she's witty and fair, And has a rich Jointure, my Laddie. What cou'd ye wish better your Pleasure to crown, Than a Widow, the bonniest Toast in the Town, With nathing, but draw in your Stool, and sit down, And sport with the Widow, my Laddie. Then till her, and kill her with Courtesy dead, Tho' stark Love and Kindness be all ye can plead; Be heartsome and airy, and hope to succeed With a bonny gay Widow, my Laddie. Strike Iron while 'tis het, if ye'd have it to wald, For Fortune ay favours the Active and Bauld, But ruines the Woer that's thowless and cauld, Unfit for the Widow, my Laddie. The STEP-DAUGHTER's Relief. To the Tune of, The Kirk wad let me be. I was anes a well tocher'd Lass My Mither left Dollars to me; But now I'm brought to a poor Pass, My Step-dame has gart them flee. My Father he's aften frae hame, And she plays the Deel with his Gear; She neither has Lateth nor Shame, And keeps the hale House in a steer. She's barmy fac'd, thriftless and bauld, And gars me aft fret and repine; While hungry, half naked and cauld, I see her destroy what's mine: But soon I might hope a Revenge, And soon of my Sorrows be free, My Poortith to Plenty wad change, If she were hung up on a Tree. Quoth Ringan, wha lang time had loo'd This bonny Lass tenderly, I'll tak thee, sweet May, in thy Snood, Gif thou wilt gae hame with me, 'Tis only your sell that I want; Your Kindness is better to me, Than a' that your Step-mother, scant Of Grace, now has taken frae thee. I'm but a young Farmer, 'tis true, And ye are the Sprout of a Laird; But I have Milk-cattle enow, And Rowth of good Rucks in my Yard. Ye sall have nathing to fash ye; Sax Servants sall jouk to thee: Then kilt up thy Coats, my Lassie, And gae thy ways hame with me. The Maiden her Reason employ'd, Not thinking the Offer amiss, Consented:—While Ringan o'erjoy'd, Receiv'd her with mony a Kiss. And now she sits blythly singan, And joking her drunken Step-dame, Delighted with her dear Ringan, That makes her Goodwife at hame. The Soger Laddie. My Soger Laddie is over the Sea, And he will bring Gold and Money to me; And when he comes hame, he'll make me a Lady: My Blessing gang with my Soger Laddie. My doughty Laddie is handsome and brave, And can as a Soger and Lover behave: True to his Country, to Love he is steady; There's few to compare with my Soger Laddie. Shield him, ye Angels, frae Death in Alarms, Return him with Lawrels to my langing Arms, Syne frae all my Care ye'll pleasantly free me, When back to my Wishes my Soger ye gi'e me. O soon may his Honours bloom fair on his Brow, As quickly they must, if he get his Due; For in noble Actions his Courage is ready, Which makes me delight in my Soger Laddie.</field>

[1720] Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri Tibia sumes celebrare, CLIO? Hor. O could my Muse in nervous Numbers draw, The Merit and surprizing Feats of LAW, Sublime like MARO she should sing the Man Profound in Project, destin'd to command. Inferiour Minds are stun'd to see the Maze Of God-like Thought, where his vast Genius plays With so much Ease; without a wrinkl'd Brow Inimitable Plans he doth pursue. BLEST Monarch! By indulgent Heav'n carest, Whose Crown's of such a valu'd Gem possest, Such were thy JOVE and PHOEBUS, antient Greece, And such thy JASON, who brought Thee a Fleece; A Fleece of Gold the Æmonian Hero gain'd: France finds in Fact what's in the Fable feign'd. HAD Fate decree'd His Birth when Time was young, Had he in Athens or in Sparta sprung; They who capacious Souls for Arts or Wars Did deifie, or write their Names on Stars, Would soon on their Olympus found a Place For Him amongst the high immortal Race. Not so we're taught; enough for us we know That he's one of the first e'er shone below, Excelling, in a present splendid Fame, Each eterniz'd fictitious daz'ling Name Of Gods and Demi-gods, whose Glories throng Th'harmonious Greek and Mantuan Shepherd's Song. LIKE a fair River wynding thro' the Plain, Increasing by successive Springs and Rain, Grown to a Sea, it challenges Esteem, And Plenty broods where e'er it turns its Stream. 'Till thus unite, how vain's the useless Rill, Falling thro' Chinks adown the naked Hill; Long in forgotten Wilds thro' Rocks they reel, Or in the mossie Pits their Eddies wheel. SO all His just Ideas fertile flow, And by their Course prolifick Riches grow; His Patronizing vig'rous Life imparts To Springs of Traffick and ingenious Arts, Without Encouragement, how oft with Pain The Mulcibers their Anvils beat in vain; And others who in useful Crafts excel, While unimploy'd in lonely Cots they dwell: Warm'd into Action with his ev'ry Scheme, Thousands with glowing Breasts at Greatness aim. HOW great's the Strength of one superiour Soul, Who shining thus in highest Spheres can roll? Kings idly search for Colonies abroad, Without a Star like Him to point the Road. Propt by his Conduct, LOUIS lifts his Head, And views his Kingdom flourish like a Mead. He speaks his Will,—the numerous Wooly Tribe Brouze amongst Vines, or glean the new shorn Glibe: In Room of scanty Fare, these will afford More solid Viands to the Gallick Board. They charge their Looms, their publick Wealth advance, And banish Canvass Cloathing out of France. TH'imagin'd Worth of Stones, costly 'cause rare, Trifles which merit neither Love nor Care, And most by empty Heads and Children priz'd, In France by his Advice become despis'd: The glaring Peeble must no more appear To load the fair One's Hands, her Neck or Ear. These he'll exchange for what is really good, And chear the industrious Poor with Cloaths and Food. The wise European thus with Glass and Toys The Savage Indian of his Wealth decoys. PARISIANS wrapt in hopeful View foresee The moving Masts come tow'ring from the Sea, Up their own Seine, t'unload the foreign Store, Straight from the Hatches at the Merchant's Door: Here Thousands from all Europe's Nations come, And make Lutetia vie with antient Rome. MADAMOISELLES, who at Court Balls and Plays, And Basset Tables, spent both Nights and Days, Forget their Visits, Tea and dressing Box, And all their pretty Accents turn on Stocks: Hundreds grown Thousands raise such fond Desires, The Sex, all Passion, this new Wonder fires. THE chearfull Peasant no more now repines, Eas'd of his Tax, with Pleasure prunes his Vines: Soon as the East is guilded with the Dawn, For LAW he kneels to Heav'n with uplift Hand, Who on th'expecting Croud his Bounty pours, Descending like great JOVE in Golden Showers. Great SIR,— WHILE Ships divide the Waves, as long's the Sun From Cancer back to Capricorn shall run, The grateful GAULS your Mem'ry will revere, And glorious in their Annals You'll appear; Who form'd them Banks, their sinking Credit rais'd, Whilst Your warm Fancy in MISSISIPPI blaz'd: When a new Paris rises in that Land, In Parian Stone, or Brass Your Form shall stand, Sacred to those who poorly pent at home, At large on fertile Plains with Pleasure roam. HOW happy's he who with Success imploys His tow'ring Schemes, and what he reaps enjoys; Who nobly to what's truly great aspires, And gratifies his rational Desires: Thus You with steady Mind serenely move Thro' Life, and all the Joys of Life improve. O more than Man! Once, once Your native Land, Often, tho active, wise behind the Hand, Had the first Offer of Your vast Ingine; Acted by meaner Views and wrong Design, Declin'd the golden Minute of her Fate, Which might have made her flourish, rich and great. Beneath her 'tis to fear or yet complain, Her Sons are brave, and you're her Son and Friend: Unnumber'd Herds her lofty Hills adorn, The warmer Vales exuberant yields her Corn; Her Seas of Fish contain a lasting Fund, Which fills each Bay, clear River, Lake and Pond. DARLING of SCOTS! Deign us thy matchless Aid, So may the Powers propitious be your Guide, In ev'ry publick spirited Design, 'Till you above with fellow Angels shine. IN all Your Actions Greatness is confest, Nor can Your Mind b' elated or deprest, Above or under its own innate Worth, By what sublimest Numbers can set forth: Yet take from a SCOTS Muse Part of what's due, A Muse, who but to Merit ne'er shall bow, And's proud to make her Boast she's sung to YOU.

When Men of Mettle thought it Nonsence To heed that cleping Thing ca'd Conscience; And by free Thinking had the Knack Of jeering ilka Word it spake: And as a learned Author speaks, Imploy'd it like a Pair of Breeks, To hide their lewd and nasty Sluces, Which eith slipt down for baith these Uses. Then Duniwhistle worn with Years, And gawn the Gate of his Forbears, Commanded his three Sons to come And wait upon him in his Room: Bad Bristle steek the Door, and syne He thus began:— DUNIWHISTLE. —Dear Bairns of mine, I quickly maun submit to Fate, And leave you three a good Estate, Which has been honourably won, And handed down frae Sire to Son, But Clag or Claim for Ages past; Now that ye mayna prove the last, Here's three Permission Bonnets for ye, Which your Grand Gutchers wore before ye; And if ye'd hae nae Man betray ye, Let naithing ever wile them frae ye, But keep the Bonnets on your Heads, And Hands frae signing foolish Deeds, And ye shall never want sic Things Shall gar ye be made of by Kings: But if you ever with them part, Fou sair ye'll for your Folly smart. Bare-headed then ye'll look like Snools, And dwindle down to silly Tools. Had up your Hands, now swear and say, As ye shall answer on a Day,— Ye'll faithfully observe my Will, And a' its Premisses fulfill. BRISTLE. My worthy Father I shall strive To keep your Name and Fame alive, And never shaw a Saul that's dastard, To gar Fowk tak me for a Bastard: If e'er by me ye're disobey'd, May Witches nightly on me ride. JOUKUM. Wha e'er shall dare by Force or Guile This Bonnet aff my Head to wile, For sic a bauld Attempt shall rue, And ken I was begot by you. Else may I like a Gipsie wander, Or for my daily Bread turn Paunder. BAWSY. May I be jyb'd by great and sma', And kytch'd like ony Tenis Ba', Be the Disgrace of a' my Kin, If e'er I with my Bonnet twin. BARD. Now soon as each had gi'en his Aith, The Auld Man yielded up his Breath, Was row'd in Linnen white as Snaw, And to his Fathers born awa. But scarcely he in Mools was rotten Before his Testment was forgotten, As ye shall hear frae future Sonnet, How Joukum sinder'd with his Bonnet, And bought frae's senseless Billy Bawsy, His to propine a giglet Lassy, While worthy Bristle, not sae doner'd, Preserves his Bonnet and is honour'd. Thus Caractacus did behave, Tho' by the Fate of War a Slave; His Body only,—for his Mind No Roman Power could break or bend. With Bonnet on he bauldly spake, His Greatness gart his Fetters crack. The Victor did his Friendship claim, And sent him with new Glories hame. But leave we Birss and Similie, And to our Tale with Ardour flee. Beyond the Hills where lang the Billies Had bred up Queys and Kids and Fillies, And foughten mony a bloody Battle, With Thieves that came to lift their Cattle, There liv'd a Lass kept Rary-shows, And Fidlers ay about her House, Wha at her Table fed, and ranted With the stout Ale she never wanted. She was a winsome Wench and waly, And cou'd put on her Claiths fu' brawly; Rumbled to ilka Market Town, And drink and feight like a Dragoon: Just sic as her wha far aff wander'd To get her sell well Alexander'd. Rose had a Word of meikle Siller, Whilk brought a hantla Woers till her. Amang the Rest young Master Jouk She conquer'd ae Day with a Look; Frae that Time forth he ne'er cou'd stay At Hame to mind his Corn or Hay, But grew a Beau, and did adorn Himself with Fifty Bows of Corn, Forby what he took on, to rigg Him out with Linnings, Shoon and Wig, Snuff-boxes, Sword-knots, Canes and Washes, And Sweeties to bestow on Lasses, Cou'd newest Aiths genteely swear, And had a Course of Flaws perquire: He drank and danc'd, and sigh'd to move Fair Rosie to accept his Love. After dumb Sings he thus began, And spake his Mind to 'er like a Man. JOUKUM. O tack me Rosie to your Arms, And let me revel o'er your Charms; If ye say na, I needna care For Rapes or Tethers made of Hair, Penknives or Pools I winna need, That Minute ye say na, I'm dead. O let me ly within ye'r Breast, And at your dainty Table feast; Well do I like your Gowd to finger, And sit to hear your Staneless Singer, While on this Sun-side o' the Brae, Belangs to you, my Limbs I lay. ROSIE. I own, sweet Sir, ye woo me frankly, But a' your Courtship sars sae rankly Of selfish Interest, that I'm fleed My Person least imploys your Head. JOUKUM. What a Distinction that's you're making, When your poor Lover's Heart is breaking? With little Logick I can shew, That every Thing you have is you; Beside the Beauties of your Person, These Beds of Flowers ye set your A? on, Your Claiths, your Lands, and lying Pelf, Are ev'ry ane your very self, And add fresh Lustre to those Graces With which addorn'd your Saul and Face is, ROSIE. Ye seem to have a loving Flame For me, and hate your native Hame; That gars me ergh to trust ye meikle, For fear ye shou'd prove fause and fikle. JOUKUM. In Troth my rugged Billy Bristle, About his Gentries makes sic fistle, That if a Body contradict him, He's ready with a Durk to stick him; That wearies me of hame I vow, And fain wad live and die with you. BARD. Observing Jouk a wee Tate tipsy, Smirking, reply'd the pauky Gypsie. ROSIE. I wad be very wae to see My Lover tack the Pet and die; Wherefore I am inclin'd to ease ye, And do what in me lies to please ye: But first, e'er we conclude the Paction, You must perform some gallant Action, To prove the Truth of what you've said, Else I for you shall die a Maid. JOUKUM. My dearest Jewel gie't a Name, That I may win baith you and Fame: Shall I gae feight with Forrest Bulls, Or cleave down Troops with thicker Sculls? Or shall I dowk the deepest Sea, And Coral pou for Beads to thee? Penty the Pope upon the Nose, Or pish upon a hundred Beaus? ROSIE. In Trouth, dear Lad, I wad be laith, To risk your Life or do you Skaith, Only imploy your canny Skill To gain and rive your Father's Will, With the Consent of Birss and Bawsy, And I shall in my Bosom hawse ye, Soon as the fatal Bonnets three Are tane frae them and gi'en to me. JOUKUM. Which to preserve I gied my Aith, But now the Case is Life and Death, I must, or with the Bonnets part, Or twin with you and break my Heart: Sae tho the Aith we took was awfu', To keep it now appears unlawfu': Then, Love, I'll answer thy Demands, And fly to fetch them to your Hands. BARD. The famous Jilt of Palastine, Thus drew the Howks o'er Sampson's Een, And gart him tell where lay his Strength, Of which she twin'd him at the Length, Then gied him up in Chains to rave, And labour like a Galley Slave: But Rosie, mind, when growing Hair His Loss of Pith 'gan to repair, He made of Thousands an Example, By crushing them beneath their Temple. CANTO II. BARD. The Supper Sowin-Cogs and Bannocks Stood cooling on the Soles of Winnocks, And cracking at the westlin Gavels Auld Wives sat beeking of their Navels, When Jouk his Brither Bristle found, Fetching his Evening Wauk around A Score of Ploughmen of his ain, Who blythly whistled on the Plain. Jouk three Times congeed, Bristle anes, Then shook his Hand, and thus begins. BRISTLE. Wow, Brither Jouk, where hae ye been! I scarce can trow my looking Een, Ye'r grown sae braw; now Wierds defend me, Gin that I hadna 'maist miskend ye. And where gat ye that braw blew Stringing That's at your Houghs and Shouders hinging? Ye look as sprush as ane that's wooing, I ferly, Lad, what ye've been doing. JOUKUM. My very much respected Brither, Should we hide ought frae ane anither, And not, when warm'd with the same Blood, Consult ilk ane anithers good; And be it kend t'ye my Design Will Profit prove to me and mine. BRISTLE. And, Brither, Trouth it much commends Your Virtue thus to love your Friends; It makes me blyth, for aft I said Ye was a clever mettl'd Lad. JOUKUM. And sae, I hope, will ever prove, If ye befriend me in my Love: For Rosie, bonny, rich and gay, And sweet as Flowers in June or May, Her Gear I'll get, her Sweets I'll rifle, If ye'll but yield me up a Trifle. Promise to do't, and ye'se be free With ony Thing pertains to me. BRISTLE. I lang to answer your Demand, And never shall for Trifles stand. JOUKUM. Then she desires as a Propine These Bonnets Bawsy's Yours and Mine; And well I wat that's nae great Matter, If I sae easily can get her. BRISTLE. Ha, ha! ye Judas, are ye there, The D? then nor she ne'er get mair. Is that the Trifle that ye spoke of! Wha think ye, Sir, ye make a Mock of? Ye silly mansworn Scant-of-Grace, Swith, let me never see your Face. Seek my auld Bonnet aff my Head! Faith that's a bonny ane indeed! Require a Thing I'll part with never, She's get as soon the Lap o'my Liver. Vile Whore and Jad, the Woody hang her. BARD. This said, he said nae mair for Anger, But curs'd and ban'd, and was na far Frae treding Jouk amang the Glar. While Jouk with Language glibe as Oolie, Right pawkily kept aff a Toolie, Well masked with a Wedder's Skin, Altho he was a Tod within. He hum'd and hae'd, and with a Cant Held forth as he had been a Saint, And quoted Texts to prove we'd better Part with a sma' Thing for a greater. JOUK. Ah Brither! may the Furies rack me, If I mean'd ill, but ye mistak me: But gin your Bonnet's sick a Jewel, Pray gie't or keep it, Sir, as you will, Since your auld fashion'd Fancy rather Inclines till't than a Hat and Feather. But I'll go try my Brither Bawsy, Poor Man, he's nae sae daft and sawsy, With empty Pride to crook his Mou, And hinder his ain good like you; If him and me agree, ne'er doubt ye, We'll mak the Bargain up without ye; Syne your braw Bonnet and your Nodle Will hardly baith be worth a Bodle. BARD. At this bauld Bristle's Colour chang'd, He swore on Rose to be reveng'd; For he began now to be flied She'd wile the Honours frae his Head. Syne with a stern and cankard Look He thus reprov'd his Brother Jouk. BRISTLE. Thou vile Disgrace of our Forbeers, Wha lang with valiant Dint of Weirs, Maintain'd their Rights 'gainst a' Intrusions Of our auld Faes the Rosycrucians, Do'st thou design at last to catch Us in a Girn with this base Match, And for the hading up thy Pride, Upon thy Breether's Riggings ride? I'll see you hang'd and her thegither, As high as Haman in a Tether, E'er I with my ain Bonnet quat, For ony borrow'd Beaver-Hat, Whilk I, as Rosie takes the Fikes, Maun wear, or no, just as she likes: Then let me hear nae mair about her, For if again ye dare to mutter Sic vile Proposals in my Hearing, Ye needna trust to my forbearing; For soon my Beard will tak a Low, And I shall crack your crazy Pow. BARD. This said, brave Bristle said nae mair, But cock'd his Bonnet with an Air, Wheel'd round with glooming Brows and muddy, And left his Brither in a Study. CANTO III BARD. Now Sol with his lang Whip gae Cracks Upon his nighering Coosers Backs, To gar them tak th'Olympian Brae, With a Cart-Laid of bleezing Day; The Country Hynd ceases to snore, Bangs frae his Bed unlocks the Door, His Bladder tooms, and gi'es a Rift, Then tentily surveys the Lift, And weary'd of his Wife and Fleas, To their Embrace prefers his Claiths. Scarce had the Lark forsook his Nest, When Jouk wha had got little Rest For thinking on his Plot and Lassie, Gat up to gang and deal with Bawsie; Away fast o'er the Bent he gade, And fand him dozing in his Bed, His Blankets crishy, foul his Sark, His Courtains trim'd with Spiders Wark; Soot Draps hang frae his Roof and Kiples, His Floor was a' Tobacco Spitles; Yet on the Antlets of a Deer Hang mony a Claimore and Spear, With Coat of Iron and Target trusty, Inch thick of Dirt and unco rusty; Enough appear'd to shaw his Billy That he was lazy, poor and silly, And wadna make sae great a Bustle About his Bonnet as did Bristle. Jouk three Times rugged at his Shouder, Cry'd three Times laigh and three Times louder; At Langrun Bawsy kare'd his Een, And crys, Wha's that? What do you mean? Then looking up he sees his Brither. BAWSY. Good Morrow Jouk what brings ye hither, You're early up,—as I'm a Sinner I seenle rise before my Dinner: Well what's ye'r News, and how gaes a'? Ye've been an unko Time awa. JOUKUM. Bawsy, I'm blyth to see you well, For me, thank GOD, I keep my Heal: Get up, get up, ye lazy Mart, I have a Secret to impart, Of which when I give you an Inkling, It will set baith your Lugs a tinkling. BARD. Straight Bawsy rises, quickly dresses, While Haste his youky Mind expresses: Now rigg'd, and Morning-Drink brought in, Thus did slee-gabet Jouk begin. JOUKUM. My worthy Brither, well I wate O'er feckless is your wee Estate, For sic a mickle Saul as yours, That to Things greater higher towrs; But ye ly loitering here at hame, Neglectfu' baith of Wealth and Fame, Tho', as I said, ye have a Mind That is for higher Things design'd. BAWSY. That's very true, thanks to the Skies, But how to get them there it lies. JOUKUM. I'll tell ye Baws,—I've laid a Plot, That only wants your casting Vote, And if you'll gie't, your Bread is baken; But first accept of this Love Taken; Here take this Gowd, and never want Enough to gar you drink and rant; And this is but an Arle-penny To what I afterward design ye; And in return I'm sure that I Shall naithing seek that ye'll deny. BAWSY. And Trouth now Jouk and neither will I, Or after never ca' me Billy; If I refuse Wae light upon me, This Gowd, O wow! 'tis wonder bonny. JOUKUM. Ay that it is,—'tis e'en the a' That gars the Plough of Living draw: Tis Gowd gars Sogers feight the Fiercer, Without it preaching wad be scarcer; 'Tis Gowd that makes some great Men witty, And puggy Lasses fair and pretty; Without it Ladies nice wad dwindle Down to a Wife that snoovs a Spindle. But to the Point, and wave Digression, I make a free and plain Confession, That I'm in Love, and, as I said, Demand frae you a little Aid To gain a Bride that eith'y can Make me fou blest, and you a Man; Give me your Bonnet to present My Mistress with,—and your Consent To rive the daft auld-fashion'd Deed, That bids ye wear it on your Head. BAWSY. O gosh! O gosh! Then, Jouk, have at her, If that be a' 'tis nae great Matter. JOUKUM. These granted, she demands nae mair To let us in her Riches skair; Nor shall our Herds as heretofore, Rin aff with ane anither's Store, Nor ding out ane anither's Harns, When they forgether amang the Karns; But freely may drive up and down, And sell in ilka Market Town Belongs to Her,—which soon ye'll see, If ye be wise, belang to me; And when that happy Day shall come, My honest Bawsy there's my Thumb, That while I breath I'll ne'er beguile ye, Ye'se baith get Gowd and be a Bailly. BAWSY. Faith, Jouk, I see but little Skaith In breaking of a senseless Aith, That is impos'd by doited Dads, (To please their Whims) on thoughtless Lads. My Bonnet! welcome to my Bonnet, And meikle good may ye mak on it. Our Father's Will, I'se make nae Din, Tho Rosie shou'd apply't behin. But say, does Billy Bristle ken This your Design to make us Men? JOUKUM. Ay that he does, but the stiff Ass Bears a Heart-hatred at the Lass, And rattles out a hantla Stories Of Blood and Dirt and antient Glories, Meaning fool Feuds that us'd to be Between ours and her Family; Bans like a Blockhead that he'll ne'er Twin with his Bonnet for a'er Gear; But you and I conjoyn'd can ding him, And, by a Vote, to Reason bring him: If we stand closs, 'tis unko eith To rive the Test'ment spite o's Teeth, And gar him ply, for a' his Clavers, To lift his Bonnet to our Beavers. BAWSY. Then let the Doof delight in drudging; What Cause have we to tent his grudging? Tho' Rosie's Flocks feed on his Fells, If you and I be well our sells. BARD. Thus Jouk and Bawsy were agree'd, And Birss maun yield, it was decreed. Thus far I've sung, in Highland Strains, Of Jouk's Amours, and pawky Pains To gain his Ends with ilka Brither, Sae opposite to ane anither; Of Bristle's hardy Resolutions, And Hatred to the Rosicrucians; Of Bawsy put in Slav'ry Neck-fast, Selling his Bonnet for a Breakfast. What follows on't, of Gain or Skaith, I'se tell when we have tane our Breath. CANTO IV. BARD. Now soon as e'er the Will was torn, Jouk, with twa Bonnets on the Morn, Frae Fairyland fast bang'd away, The Prize at Rosie's Feet to lay; Wha sleely when he did appear, About his Success 'gan to speer. JOUKUM. Here, bonny Lass, your humble Slave Presents you with the Things ye crave, The riven Will and Bonnets twa, Which makes the Third worth nought ava. Our Power gi'en up, now I demand Your promis'd Love, and eke your Hand. BARD. Rose smil'd to see the Lad outwitted, And Bonnets to the Flames committed. Immediately an awfu' Sound, As ane wad thought, raise frae the Ground; And syne appear'd a stalwart Ghaist, Whase stern and angry Looks amaist Unhool'd their Sauls,—shaking, they saw Him frae the Fire the Bonnets draw: Then came to Jouk, and, with twa Drugs, Encreas'd the Length of baith his Lugs; And said, GHAIST. Be a' thy days an Ass, And Hackney to this cunning Lass: But for these Bonnets, I'll preserve them, For Bairns unborn, that will deserve them. BARD. With that he vanished'd frae their Een, And left poor Jouk wi' Breeks not clean, He shakes while Rosie rants and capours, And ca's the Vision nought but Vapours; Rubs o'er his Cheeks and Gab wi' Reem, Till he believes't to be a Dream: Syne to her Closet leads the Way, To soup him up with Usquabae. ROSIE. Now, bonny Lad, ye may be free To handle ought pertains to me; And e'er the Sun, tho' he be dry, Has driven down the Westlin Sky, To drink his Wamefu' of the Sea, There's be but ane of you and me. In Marriage ye shall hae my Hand; But I maun hae the sole Command In Fairyland to saw and plant, And to send there for ought I want. BARD. Ay, ay, crys Jouk, all in a Fire, And stiff'ning into strong Desire. JOUKUM. Come hast thee, let us sign and seal; And let my Billies gae to the D?. BARD. Here it wad make o'er lang a Tale, To tell how meikle Cakes and Ale, And Beef, and Brose, and Gryce and Geese, And Pyes a running o'er wi' Creesh, Was serv'd upon the Wedding-table, To make the Lads and Lasses able To do, ye ken what we think Shame (Tho' ilk ane does't) to gie't a Name. But true it is, they soon were buckled, And soon she made poor Jouk a Cuckold, And play'd her bawdy Sports before him, With Chiels that car'd na Tippence for him; Beside a Rosicrucian Trick She had of Dealing with Auld-Nick; And when ere Jouk began to grumble, Auld Nick in the niest Room wad rumble. She drank, and fought, and spent her Gear With Dice, and selling o' the Mear. Thus living like a Belzi's Get, She ran her sell sae deep in Debt By borrowing Money at a' Hands, That yearly Income of her Lands Scarce paid the Interest of her Bands. Jouk, ay ca'd wise behind the Hand, The Daffine of his Doings fand: O'er late he now began to see The Ruin of his Family: But, past Relief, lar'd in a Midding, He's now oblig'd to do her Bidding. Away, with strict Command, he's sent To Fairyland to lift the Rent, And with him mony a Catterpillar To rug frae Birss and Bawsy Siller; For her braid Table maun be serv'd, Tho' Fairy-fowk shou'd a' be starv'd. Jouk thus surrounded with his Guards, Now plunders Hay-stacks, Barns and Yards, They drive the Nowt frae Bristle's Fald, While he can nought but ban and scald. BRISTLE. Vile Slave to a Hissy, ill begotten, By many Dads, with Claps half rotten. Were't no for Honour of my Mither, I shou'd na think ye were my Brither. JOUKUM. Dear Brither, why this rude Reflection? Learn to be gratefu' for Protection; The Peterenians, Bloody Beasts, That gar Fowk lik the Dowps of Priests Else on a Brander, like a Haddock, Be broolied, sprowling, like a Padock. These Monsters, lang or now had come With Faggots, Taz, and Tuck o' Drum, And twin'd you of your Wealth and Lives Syne, without speering, m? your Wives, Had not the Rosicrucians stood The Bulwarks of your Rights and Blood; And yet, forsooth, ye girn and grumble, And, with a Gab unthankfu', mumble Out mony a black unworthy Curse, When Rosie bids ye draw your Purse; When she's sae generously content With not aboon Thirty per Cent. BRISTLE. Damn you and her! tho' now I'm blae I'm hopefu' yet to see the Day, I'll gar ye baith repent that e'er Ye reav'd by Force, away, my Gear Without, or Thanks, or making Price, Or ever speering my Advice JOUKUM. Peace Gowk, we naithing do at a', But by the Letter of the Law: Then nae mair with your Din torment us, Gowling like ane non compos mentis, Else Rosie issue may a Writ, To ty ye up baith Hand and Fit, And dungeon ye, but Meat or Drink, Till ye be starv'd, and die in Stink. BARD. Thus Jouk and Bristle when they met, With sick braw Language ither tret. Just Fury glows in Bristle's Veins; And tho' his Bonnet he retains, Yet on his Crest he may not cock it, But in a Coffer closs maun lock it. Bareheaded thus, he e'en knocks under, And lets them drive away the Plunder. Sae have I seen, beside a Tower, The King of Brutes obliged to cour; And, on his Royal Paunches, thole A Dwerf to prog him with a Pole; While he wad shaw his Fangs and rage With bootless Brangling in his Cage. Now follows that we take a Peep Of Bawsy looking like a Sheep, By Bristle hated and despis'd, By Jouk and Rose as little priz'd. Soon as the Horse had heard his Brither Joukum and Rose were prick'd thegither, Away he scours o'er Hight and How, Fow fidgen fain what e'er he dow, Counting what Things he now did mister, That wad be gi'en him by his Sister. Like shallow Bards wha think they flee, Because they live Sax Stories high, To some poor lifeless Lucubration Prefixes fleeching Dedication, And blythly dream they'll be restor'd To Ale-house-Credit by my Lord. Thus Bawsy's Mind in Plenty row'd, While he thought on his promis'd Gowd And Baillyship, which he with Fines Wad make like the West-India's Mines; Arrives, with future Greatness dizy, Ca's, where's Mest Jouk?— BEEF. —Mest Jouk is bisy. BAWSY. My Lady Rose is she at Leasure? BEEF. No, Sir, my Lady's at her Pleasure. BAWSY. I wait for Her or Him, go shew; BEEF. And pray ye, Master, wha are you? BAWSY. Upo' my Saul this Porter's sawsy; Sirra, go tell my Name is Bawsy, Their Brither wha made up the Marriage. BEEF. And sae I thought by your daft Carriage. Between your Houghs gae clap your Gelding, Swith hame and feast upon a Spelding, For there's nae Room beneath this Roof To entertain a simple Coof, The like of you that nane can trust, Wha to your ain have been unjust. BARD. This said, he dadded too the Yet, And left poor Bawsy in a Fret, Wha loudly gowld and made a Din, That was o'er-heard by a' within. Quoth Rose to Jouk, Come let's away, And see wha's yon makes a this Fray. Away they went, and saw the Creature Sair runkling ilka silly Feature Of his dull Phiz, with Girns and Glooms, Stamping and biting at his Thumbs. They tented him a little while, Then came full on him with a Smile, Which soon gart him forget the Torture Was rais'd within him by the Porter. Sae will a sucking Weanie yell, But shake a Rattle or a Bell, It hads its Tongue—Let that alane, It to its Yamering faws again: Lilt up a Sang, and streight its seen To laugh with Tears into its Een. Thus eithly anger'd, eithly pleas'd, Weak Bawsy lang they tantaliz'd, With Promises right wide extended, They ne'er perform'd nor e'er intended: But now and then when they did need him, A Supper and a Pint they gied him; That done, they have nae mair to say, And scarcely ken him the neist Day. Poor Follow now this mony a Year, With some faint Hope, and Routh of Fear, He has been wrestling with his Fate, A Drudge to Joukum and his Mate; While Bristle saves his manly Look, Regardless baith of Rose and Jouk, Mantains right quietly yond the Kairns His Honour, Conscience, Wife and Bairns. Jouk and his Rumblegare Wife Drive on a drunken, gaming Life, 'Cause Sober they can get nae Rest For Nick and Duniwhistle's Ghaist, Wha in the Garrets aften tooly, And shore them with a bloody Guly. Thus have I sung in hamelt Rhime, A Sang that scorns the Teeth of Time; Yet modestly I hide my Name, Admiring Virtue mair than Fame. But tent ye wha despise Instruction, And gives my Wark a wrang Construction, Frae hind my Courtain, mind I tell ye, I'll shoot a Satyre thro' your Belly: But wha with Havins jees his Bonnet, And says, Thanks t'ye for your Sonnet, He shanna want the Praises due To Generosity. Adieu. FINIS From Fables and Tales [1722] Bag-pipes no Musick: A SATYRE on Scots Poetry. An Epistle to Mr. STANHOPE. As Dryden justly term'd Poetick Sound, A pacing Pegasus on Carpet G[r]ound, Roscommon's nervous Sense your Verses yield A Courser bounding o'er the furrow'd Field: The Track pursue,—that thinking Scots may see The comprehensive English Energy. Scotch Moggy may go down at Aberdeen, Where Bonnets, Bag-pipers, and Plaids are seen; But such poor Gear no Harmony can sute, Much fitter for a Jew's Trump than a Lute. Low Bells, not Lyres, the Highland Cliffs adorn, Macklean's loud halloo, or Mackgregor's Horn. Sooner shall China yield to Earthen Ware, Sooner shall Abel teach a singing Bear, Than English Bards let Scots torment the'r Ear. Who think their rustick Jargon to explain, For anes is once, lang, long, and two is twain, Let them to Edinburgh foot it back, And add their Poetry to fill their Pack, While you the Fav'rite of the tuneful Nine, Make English Deeds in English Numbers shine. Leave Ramsay's Clan to follow their own Ways, And while they mumble Thistles, wear the Bays. John Couper. Oxford, Novemb. 4. 1720 Grubstreet nae Satyre. In Answer to Bagpipes no Musick. An Epistle to the Umquhile John Cowper, late Kirk-Treasurer's Man of Edinburgh; now his Ghaist studying Poetry at Oxford, for the Benefit of E. Curl. DEAR John, what ails ye now? ly still: Hout Man! What need ye take it ill That Allan buried ye in Rhime, May be a Start afore ye'r Time? He's nathing but a shire daft Lick, And disna care a Fidle-stick, Altho your Tutor Curl and ye Shou'd serve him sae in Elegy. DOUP down doild Ghaist, and dinna fash us With Carpet Ground, and nervous Clashes; Your Grubstreet Jargon Dryden wounds, When mixt with his Poetick Sounds. You pace on Pegasus! Take Care, He'll bound o'er furrow'd Fields of Air, And fling ye headlong frae the Skies, Never a second Time to rise: With sic a Fa, alake! ye'll e'en a' Dash into Sherds like broken China. China and Men the same Fate skair, Ah me! baith bruckle Earthen Ware. LANG serv'd ye in a mettl'd Station, The foremost Beegle of our Nation, For scenting out the yeilding Creature, Wha us'd to play at Whats-the-matter: But now, O fy for Shame to trudge, Mun Curle's poor Hackney scribling Drudge, To fill his Pack, while you, right fair, Gain Title braw! His singing Bear. But, John, Wha taught ye ilka Name, That shines sae bonnily in Fame, Rosecommon, Stanhope, Ramsay, Dryden, Wha Back of winged Horse cou'd ride on? A' them we ken; but wha the D? Bad you up Hill Parnassus speel. YOU Ramsay make a feckfu' Man, Ringleader of a hearty Clan: Goodfaith it sets ye well to fear him, For gin ye etle anes to steer him, He'll gloom ye dead;—in Rustick Phrase He'll gar his Thistles rive your Bays. PATE BIRNIE. Kinghorn, 16th November, 1720. From The British Journal: March 9, 1723 Translation of the Aeneid, X, 693–6. Firm as the Bass when thund'ring Tempests roar, And furious Waves come cracking on its Sides, While Hills inferior sink upon the Shore, It in its height and strong Foundation prides. Such is the Man whose Godlike Spirit rises Amidst a Hurricane of Wayward Fate, He stands immov'd, while his brave Soul despises Those Shocks of Chance which Makes the Vulgar fret. From The Tea-Table Miscellany [1724–29] DEDICATION [TO Ilka lovely British Lass] TO Ilka lovely British Lass, Frae Ladys Charlote, Anne, and Jean, Down to ilk bonny singing Bess, Wha dances barefoot on the Green. Dear Lasses, Your most humble Slave, Wha ne'er to serve ye shall decline; Kneeling wad your Acceptance crave, When he presents this sma' Propine. Then take it kindly to your Gare, Revive it with your tunefu' Notes: Its Beauties will look sweet and fair, Arising saftly through your Throats. The Wanton wee Thing will rejoice, When tented by a sparkling Eye, The Spinnet tinkling with her Voice, It lying on her lovely knee. While Kettles dringe on Ingles dure, Or Clashes stays the lazy Lass, Thir Sangs may ward you frae the sowr, And gayly vacant Minutes pass. E'en while the Tea's fill'd reeking round, Rather than plot a tender Tongue, Treat a' the circling Lugs wi' Sound, Syne safely sip when ye have sung. May Happiness had up your Hearts, And warm you lang with loving Fires, May Powers propitious play their Parts In matching you to your Desires. A. RAMSAY. Edinr. January 1. 1724. A Scots Cantata The Tune after an Italian Manner. Compos'd by Signior LORENZO BOCCHI Recitative Blate Jonny faintly teld fair Jean his Mind, Jeany took Pleasure to deny him lang He thought her Scorn came frae a Heart unkind, Which gart him in Despair tune up this Sang. Air O bonny Lassie, since 'tis sae, That I'm despis'd by thee, I hate to live; but O I'm wae, And unko sweer to die. Dear Jeany, think what dowy Hours I thole by your Disdain; Ah! should a Breast sae saft as yours Contain a Heart of Stane. Recitative These tender Notes did a' her Pity move, With melting Heart she listned to the Boy; O'ercome she smil'd, and promis'd him her Love: He in Return thus sang his rising Joy. Air Hence frae my Breast, contentious Care, Ye've tint the Power to pine, My Jeany's good, my Jeany's fair, And a' her Sweets are mine. O spread thine Arms and gi'e me Fowth Of dear enchanting Bliss, A thousand Joys around thy Mouth, Gi'e Heaven with ilka Kiss. The TOAST. To the Tune of, Saw ye my PEGGY. Come let's ha'e mair Wine in, Bacchus hates Repining, Venus loos na Dwining, Let's be blyth and free. Away with dull here t'ye, Sir, Ye'r Mistress ? gi'es her, We'll drink her Health wi' Pleasure, Wha's belov'd by thee. Then let ? warm ye, That's a Lass can charm ye, And to Joys alarm ye, Sweet is she to me. Some Angel ye wad ca' her, And never wish ane brawer, If ye bare-headed saw her, Kiltet to the Knee. ? a dainty Lass is, Come let's join our Glasses, And refresh our Hauses, With a Health to thee. Let Coofs their Cash be clinking, Be Statesmen tint in thinking, While we with Love and Drinking, Give our Cares the Lie. N.B.—The first Blank to be supply'd with the Toaster's Name, the two last with the Name of the Toast. A South-Sea Sang. Tune of, For our lang biding here. When we came to London Town, We dream'd of Gowd in Gowpings here, And rantinly ran up and down, In rising Stocks to by a Skair: We daftly thought to row in Rowth, But for our Daffine pay'd right dear; The lave will fare the war in Trouth, For our lang biding here. But when we fand our Purses toom, And dainty Stocks began to fa', We hang our Lugs, and wi' a Gloom, Girn'd at Stockjobbing ane and a'. If ye gang near the South-Sea House, The Whillywha's will grip ye'r Gear, Syne a' the lave will fare the war, For our lang biding here. Hap me with thy Petticoat. O Bell, thy Looks have kill'd my Heart, I pass the Day in Pain, When Night returns I feel the Smart, And wish for thee in vain. I'm starving cold, while thou art warm, Have Pity and incline, And grant me for a Hap that charm- ing Petticoat of thine. My ravish'd Fancy in Amaze, Still wanders o'er thy Charms, Delusive Dreams ten thousand Ways, Present thee to my Arms. But waking think what I endure, While cruel you decline Those Pleasures which can only cure This panting Breast of mine. I faint, I fail, and wildly rove, Because you still deny The just Reward that's due to Love, And let true Passion die. Oh! turn, and let Compassion seise That lovely Breast of thine; Thy Petticoat could give me Ease, If thou and it were mine. Sure Heaven has fitted for Delight That beauteous Form of thine, And thour't too good its Law to slight, By hindring the Design. May all the Powers of Love agree, At length to make thee mine, Or loose my Chains, and set me free From ev'ry Charm of thine. Fy gar rub her o'er wi' Strae. Gin ye meet a bonny Lassie, Gie 'er a Kiss and let her gae, But if ye meet a dirty Hussy, Fy gar rub her o'er wi' Strae. [The rest is, with slight differences of spelling and punctuation, identical with lines 33–60 of To the Ph? an Ode (S.T.S., Vol. I, pp. 224–225).] THE CORDIAL To the Tune of, Where shall our Goodman ly. He. Where wad bonny Ann ly, Alane nae mair ye maun ly; Wad ye a Good-man try? Is that the Thing ye're laking? She. Can a Lass sae young as I, Venture on the Bridal-Tye, Syne down with a Good-man lye? I'm fleed he keep me waking. He. Never judge until ye try, Mak me your Goodman, I Shanna hinder you to ly, And sleep till ye be weary. She. What if I shou'd waking ly When the Hoboys are gawn by, Will ye tent me when I cry, My Dear, I'm faint and iry? He. In my Bosom thou shall ly, When thou wakrife art or dry, Healthy Cordial standing by, Shall presently revive thee. She. To your Will I then comply, Join us, Priest, and let me try How I'll wi' a Goodman ly, Wha can a Cordial give me. ALLAN-WATER: Or, My Love Annie's very bonny. What Numbers shall the Muse repete? What Verse be found to praise my Annie? On her ten thousand Graces wait, Each Swain admires, and owns she's bonny. Since first she trode the happy Plain, She set each youthful Heart on Fire,— Each Nymph does to her Swain complain, That Annie kindles new Desire. This lovely Darling dearest Care; This new Delight, this charming Annie, Like Summer's Dawn, she's fresh and fair, When Flora's fragrant Breezes fan ye. All Day the am'rous Youths conveen, Joyous they sport and play before her; All Night, when she no more is seen, In blessful Dreams they still adore her. Among the Crowd Amyntor came, He look'd, he loov'd, he bow'd to Annie; His rising Sighs express his Flame, His Words were few, his Wishes many. With Smiles the lovely Maid replied, Kind Shepherd why should I deceive ye? Alas! your Love must be deny'd, This destin'd Breast can ne'er relieve ye. Young Damon came, with Cupid's Art, His Whiles, his Smiles, his Charms beguiling, He stole away my Virgin-Heart, Cease, poor Amyntor, cease bewailing. Some brighter Beauty you may find, On yonder Plain the Nymphs are many, Then chuse some Heart that's unconfin'd, And leave to Damon his own Annie. C. To L. M. M. Tune, Rantin roaring Willie. O Mary! thy graces and glances, Thy smiles so inchantingly gay, And thoughts so divinely harmonious, Clear wit and good humour display. But say not thoul't imitate angels Ought farrer, tho' scarcely, ah me! Can be found equalizing thy merit, A match amongst mortals for thee. Thy many fair beauties shed fires May warm up ten thousand to love, Who desparing, may fly to some other, While I may despair, but ne'er rove. What a mixture of sighing and joys This distant adoring of thee, Gives to a fond heart too aspiring, Who loves in sad silence like me? Thus looks the poor beggar on treasure, And shipwreck'd on landskips on shore: Be still more divine, and have pity; I die soon as hope is no more. For, Mary, my soul is thy captive, Nor loves, nor expects, to be free; Thy beauties are fetters delightful, Thy slavery's a pleasure to me. This is not mine ain House. This is not mine ain house, I ken by the rigging o't; Since with my love I've changed vows, I dinna like the bigging o't. For now that I'm young Robie's bride, And mistriss of his fire-side, Mine ain house I'll like to guide, And please me with the trigging o't. Then farewell to my father's house, I gang where love invites me; The strictest duty this allows, When love with honour meets me. When Hymen moulds us into ane, My Robie's nearer than my kin, And to refuse him were a sin, Sae lang's he kindly treats me. When I'm in mine ain house, True love shall be at hand ay To make me still a prudent spouse, And let my man command ay; Avoiding ilka cause of strife, The common pest of married life, That makes ane wearied of his wife, And breaks the kindly band ay. My Dady forbad, my Minny forbad. When I think on my lad, I sigh and am sad, For now he is far frae me. My daddy was harsh, My minny was warse, That gart him gae yont the sea, Without an estate, That made him look blate; And yet a brave lad is he. Gin safe he come hame, In spite of my dame, He'll ever be welcome to me. Love speers nae advice Of parents o'er wise, That have but ae bairn like me, That looks upon cash, As naithing but trash, That shackles what shou'd be free. And tho' my dear lad Not ae penny had, Since qualities better has he; Abiet I'm an heiress, I think it but fair is, To love him, since he loves me. Then, my dear Jamie, To thy kind Jeanie, Haste, haste thee in o'er the sea, To her wha can find Nae ease in her mind, Without a blyth sight of thee. Tho' my dady forbad, And my minny forbad, Forbidden I will not be; For since thou alone My favour hast won, Nane else shall e'er get it for me. Yet them I'll not grieve, Or without their leave, Gi'e my hand as a wife to thee: Be content with a heart, That can never desert, Till they cease to oppose or be. My parents may prove Yet friends to our love, When our firm resolves they see; Then I with pleasure Will yield up my treasure, And a' that love orders to thee. [O steer her up, and had her gawn] Tune, Steer her up, and had her gawn. O steer her up, and had her gawn, Her mither's at the mill, jo; But gin she winna tak a man, E'en let her tak her will, jo. Pray thee, lad, leave silly thinking, Cast thy cares of love away; Let's our sorrows drown in drinking, 'Tis daffin langer to delay. See that shining glass of claret, How invitingly it looks; Take it aff, and let's have mair o't, Pox on fighting, trade and books. Let's have pleasure while we're able, Bring us in the meikle bowl, Plac't on the middle of the table, And let wind and weather gowl. Call the drawer, let him fill it Fou, as ever it can hold: O tak tent ye dinna spill it, 'Tis mair precious far than gold. By you've drunk a dozen bumpers, Bacchus will begin to prove, Spite of Venus and her Mumpers, Drinking better is than love. Clout the Caldron. Have you any pots or pans, Or any broken chandlers? I am a tinkler to my trade, And newly come frae Flanders. As scant of siller as of grace, Disbanded, we've a bad-run; Gar tell the lady of the place, I'm come to clout her caldron. Fa adrie, didle, didle, &amp;c. Madam, if you have wark for me, I'll do't to your contentment, And dinna care a single flie For any man's resentment; For, lady fair, tho' I appear To every ane a tinkler, Yet to your sell I'm bauld to tell, I am a gentle jinker. Fa adrie, didle, didle, &amp;c. Love Jupiter into a swan Turn'd for his lovely Leda; He like a bull o'er meadows ran, To carry aff Europa. Then may not I, as well as he, To cheat your Argos blinker, And win your love like mighty Jove, Thus hide me in a tinkler. Fa adrie, didle, didle, &amp;c. Sir, ye appear a cunning man, But this fine plot you'll fail in, For there is neither pot nor pan Of mine you'll drive a nail in. Then bind your budget on your back, And nails up in your apron, For I've a tinkler under tack That's us'd to clout my caldron. Fa adrie, didle, didle, &amp;c. The Malt-Man. The malt-man comes on Munday, He craves wonder sair, Cries, dame, come gi'e me my siller, Or malt ye sall ne'er get mair. I took him into the pantry, And gave him some good cock-broo, Syne paid him upon a gantree, As hostler wives should do. When malt-men come for siller, And gaugers with wands o'er soon, Wives, tak them a' down to the cellar, And clear them as I have done. This bewith, when cunzie is scanty, Will keep them frae making din, The knack I learn'd frae an auld aunty, The snackest of a' my kin. The malt-man is right cunning, But I can be as slee, And he may crack of his winning, When he clears scores with me: For come when he likes, I'm ready; But if frae hame I be, Let him wait on our kind lady, She'll answer a bill for me. Bonny BESSY. Tune, Bessy's Haggies. Bessy's beauties shine sae bright, Were her many vertues fewer, She wad ever give delight, And in transport make me view her. Bonny Bessy, thee alane Love I, naithing else about thee; With thy comeliness I'm tane, And langer cannot live without thee. Bessy's bosom's saft and warm, Milk-white fingers still employ'd, He who takes her to his arm, Of her sweets can ne'er be cloy'd. My dear Bessy, when the roses Leave thy cheek, as thou grows aulder, Vertue, which thy mind discloses, Will keep love frae growing caulder. Bessy's tocher is but scanty, Yet her face and soul discovers These inchanting sweets in plenty Must intice a thousand lovers. It's not money, but a woman Of a temper kind and easy, That gives happiness uncommon, Petted things can nought but teez ye. The Quadruple Alliance. Tune, Jocky blyth and gay. Swift, Sandy, Young, and Gay, Are still my heart's delight, I sing their sangs by day, And read their tales at night. If frae their books I be, 'Tis dullness then with me; But when these stars appear, Jokes, smiles and wit shine clear. Swift with uncommon stile, And wit that flows with ease, Instructs us with a smile, And never fails to please. Bright Sandy gladly sings Of heroes, Gods, and kings: He well deserves the bays, And every Briton's praise. While thus our Homer shines: Young with Horacian flame, Corrects these false designs We push in love of fame. Blyth Gay in pawky strains, Makes villains clowns and swains Reprove, with biting leer, Those in a higher sphere. Swift, Sandy, Young, and Gay, Long may you give delight; Let all the dunces bray, You're far above their spite: Such, from a malice sour, Write nonsense, lame and poor, Which never can succeed, For, who the trash will read? The Complaint To B. I. G. To the Tune of, When absent, &amp;c. When absent from the Nymph I love, I'd fain shake off the Chains I wear; But whilst I strive these to remove, More Fetters I'm oblig'd to bear. My captiv'd Fancy Day and Night Fairer and fairer represents Bellinda form'd for dear Delight, But cruel Cause of my Complaints. All Day I wander through the Groves, And sighing hear from ev'ry Tree The happy Birds chirping their Loves, Happy compar'd with lonely me. When gentle sleep with balmy Wings To Rest fan's ev'ry weary'd Wight, A thousand Fears my Fancy brings, That keep me watching all the Night. Sleep flies, while like the Godess fair, And all the Graces in her Train, With melting Smiles and killing Air Appears the Cause of all my Pain. A while my Mind delighted flies, O'er all her Sweets with thirling Joy, Whilst Want of Worth makes Doubts arise, That all my trembling Hopes destroy. Thus while my Thoughts are fix'd on her, I'm all o'er Transport and Desire: My Pulse beats high, my Cheeks appear All Roses, and mine Eyes all Fire. When to my self I turn my View, My Veins grow chill, my Cheek look wan: Thus whilst my Fears my Pains renew, I scarcely look or move a Man. The young Lass contra auld Man. The Carle he came o'er the Croft, And his Beard new shaven, He look'd at me, as he'd been daft, The Carl trows that I wad hae him. Howt awa I winna hae him! Na forsooth I winna hae him! For a' his Beard new shaven, Ne'er a Bit will I hae him. A siller Broach he gae me niest, To fasten on my Curtchea nooked, I wor'd a wi upon my Breast; But soon alake! the Tongue o't crooked; And sae may his, I winna hae him. Na forsooth, I winna hae him! An twice a Bairn's, a Lass's Jest; Sae ony Fool for me may hae him. The Carle has na Fault but ane; For he has Land and Dollars Plenty; But wae's me for him! Skin and Bane Is no for a plump Lass of Twenty. Howt awa, I winna hae him, Na forsooth, I winna hae him, What signifies his dirty Riggs, And Cash without a Man with them. But shou'd my canker'd Dady gar Me take him 'gainst my Inclination, I warn the Fumbler to beware, That Antlers dinna claim their Station. Howt awa, I winna hae him! Na forsooth, I winna hae him! I'm flee'd to crack the haly Band, Sae Lawty says, I shou'd na hae him. SONG [Up Stairs, down Stairs] To the Tune of, Jenny beguil'd the Webster. The auld Chorus. Up Stairs, down Stairs, Timber Stairs fear me. I'm laith to lie a' Night my lane, And Johny's bed sae near me. O Mither dear, I 'gin to fear, Tho' I'm baith good and bony, I winna keep; for in my Sleep I start and dream of Johny. When Johny then comes down the Glen, To woo me, dinna hinder; But with Content gi' your Consent; For we twa ne'er can sinder. Better to marry, than miscarry; For Shame and Skaith's the Clink o't, To thole the Dool, to mount the Stool, I downa 'bide to think o't; Sae while 'tis Time, I'll shun the Crime, That gars poor Epps gae whinging, With Hainches fow, and Een sae blew, To a' the Bedrals bindging. Had Eppy's Apron bidden down, The Kirk had ne'er a kend it; But when the Word's gane thro' the Town, Alake! how can she mend it. Now Tam, maun face the Minister, And she maun mount the Pillar; And that's the Way that they maun gae, For poor Folk has nae Siller. Now ha'd ye'r Tongue, my Daughter young, Replied the kindly Mither, Get Johny's Hand in haly Band, Syne wap ye'r Wealth together. I'm o' the Mind, if he be kind, Ye'll do your Part discreetly; And prove a Wife, will gar his Life, And Barrel run right sweetly. Sleepy Body, drowsy Body. I Somnolente, Quaeso repente, Vigila, vive, me tange. Somnolente, quaeso, &amp;c II Cum me ambiebas, Videri volebas Amoris negotiis aptus; Sed factus maritus, Es semisopitus, Et semper à somnio captus. III O sleepy Body, And drowsy Body, O wiltuna waken, and turn thee: To drivel and drant, While I sigh and gaunt, Gives me good Reason to scorn thee. IV When thou shouldst be kind, Thou turns sleepy and blind, And snoters and snores far frae me. Wae Light on thy Face, Thy drowsy Embrace Is enough to gar me betray thee. SONG [Busk ye, busk ye, my bony Bride] To the tune of Busk ye, busk ye, my bony Bride; Busk ye, busk ye, my bony Marrow; Busk ye, busk ye, my bony Bride, Busk and go to the Braes of Yarrow There will we sport and gather Dew, Dancing while Lavrock[s] sing the Morning; There learn frae Turtles to prove true; O Bell, ne'er vex me with thy Scorning. To Westlin Breezes Flora yields, And when the Beams are kindly warming, Blythness appears o'er all the Fields, And Nature looks mair fresh and charming. Learn frae the Burns that trace the mead, Tho' on their Banks the Roses blossom, Yet hastylie they flow to Tweed, And pour their Sweetness in his Bosom. Hast ye, hast ye, my bony Bell, Haste to my Arms, and there I'll guard thee, With free Consent my Fears repel, I'll with my Love and Care reward thee. Thus sang I saftly to my Fair, Wha rais'd my Hopes with kind relenting. O Queen of Smiles, I ask nae mair, Since now my bony Bell's consenting. The Highland Lassie. The Lawland Maids gang trig and fine, But aft they're sour and unco sawsy; Sae proud they never can be kind, Like my good humour'd Highland Lassie. O, my bony, bony Highland Lassie, My heart smiling Highland Lassie, May never Care make thee less fair, But Bloom of Youth still bless my Lassie. Than ony Lass in Borrowstoun, Wha mak their Cheeks with Patches motie, I'd tak my Katie but a Gown, Bare footed in her little Cotie. O my bony, &amp;c. Beneath the Brier or Brecken Bush, When e'er I kiss and court my Dautie, Happy and blyth as ane wad wish, My Flighteren Heart gangs pittie-pattie. O my bony, &amp;c. O'er highest heathery Hills I'll stenn, With cockit Gun and Ratches tenty, To drive the Deer out of their Den, To feast my Lass on Dishes dainty. O my bony, &amp;c. There's nane shall dare by Deed or Word 'Gainst her to wag a Tongue or Finger, While I can weild my trusty Sword, Or frae my Side whisk out a Whinger. O my bony, &amp;c. The Mountains clad with purple Bloom, And Berries ripe invite my Treasure, To range with me, let great Fowk gloom, While Wealth and Pride confound their Pleasure. O, my bony, bony Highland Lassie, My lovely smiling Highland Lassie, May never Care make thee less fair, But Bloom of Youth still bless my Lassie. The Auld Man's Best Argument. To the Tune of, Widow are ye wawkin. O wha's that at my Chamber Door? “Fair Widow are ye wawking?” Auld Carle, your Sute give o'er, Your Love lyes a' in tawking. Gi'e me the Lad that's young and tight, Sweet like an April Meadow; 'Tis sic as he can bless the Sight, And Bosom of a Widow. “O Widow, wilt thou let me in, “I'm pawky, wise and thrifty, “And come of a right gentle Kin; “I'm little mair than Fifty.” Daft Carle, dit your Mouth, What signifies how pawky, Or gentle born ye be,—bot Youth, In Love you're but a Gawky. “Then Widow, let these Guineas speak, “That powerfully plead clinkan, “And if they fail, my Mouth I'll steek, “And nae mair Love will think on.” These court indeed, I maun confess, I think they make you young, Sir, And ten Times better can express Affection, than your Tongue, Sir. SONG [I have a green Purse and a wee pickle Gowd] To the Tune of, A Rock and a wee pickle Tow. I have a green Purse and a wee pickle Gowd, A Bony Piece Land and Planting on't, It fattens my Flocks, and my Bairns it has stowd; But the best Thing of a's yet wanting on't: To grace it, and trace it, And gie me Delight; To bless me, and kiss me, And comfort my Sight, With Beauty by Day, and Kindness by Night And nae mair my lane gang sauntring on't. My Christy she's charming, and good as she's fair; Her Een and her Mouth are inchanting sweet, She smiles me on Fire, her Frowns gie Dispair: I love while my Heart gaes panting wi't. Thou fairest, and dearest, Delight of my Mind, Whose gracious Embraces By Heav'n are designed: For happiest Transports, and Blesses refind. Nae langer delay thy granting Sweet. For thee, Bony Christy, my Shepherds and Hynds, Shall carefully make the Years Dainties thine: Thus freed frae laigh Care, while Love fills our Minds, Our Days shall with Pleasure and Plenty shine. Then hear me, and chear me, With smiling Consent, Believe me, and give me No Cause to lament, Since I ne'er can be happy, till thou say, Content, I'm pleas'd with my Jamie, and he shall be mine. On the Marriage of the R. H. L. G? and L. K? C?. A SONG To the Tune of, The Highland laddie. Brigantius. Now all thy Virgin-sweets are mine, And all the shining Charms, that grace thee; My fair Melinda come recline Upon my Breast, while I embrace thee, And tell without dissembling Art, My happy Raptures in thy Bosom: Thus will I plant within thy Heart, A Love that shall for ever blossom. Chorus. O the happy, happy, brave and bonny, Sure the Gods well pleas'd behold ye; Their work admire, so great, so fair, And well in all your Joys uphold ye. Melinda. No more I blush, now that I'm thine, To own my Love in Transport tender, Since that so brave a Man is mine, To my Brigantius I surrender. By sacred Ties I'm now to move As thy exalted Thoughts direct me; And while my Smiles engage thy Love, Thy manly Greatness shall protect me. Chorus. O the happy, &amp;c. Brigantius. Soft fall thy Words, like Morning-dew, New Life on blowing Flowers bestowing: Thus kindly yielding makes me bow To Heaven, with Spirit grateful glowing. My Honour, Courage, Wealth and Wit, Thou dear Delight, my chiefest Treasure, Shall be imployd as thou thinks fit, As Agents for our Love and Pleasure. Chorus. O the happy, &amp;c. Melinda With my Brigantius I could live In lovely Cotts, beside a Mountain, And Nature's easy Wants relieve, With Shepherds Fare, and quaff the Fountain, What pleases thee, the rural Grove, Or Congress of the Fair and Witty, Shall give me Pleasure with thy Love, In Plains retir'd or social City. Chorus. O the happy, &amp;c. Brigantius. How sweetly canst thou charm my Soul, O lovely Sum of my Desires! Thy Beauties all my Cares controul, Thy Virtue all that's Good inspires. Tune every Instrument of Sound, Which all the Mind divinely raises, Till every Height and Dale rebounds, Both loud and sweet, my Darling's Praises. Chorus. O the happy, &amp;c. Melinda. Thy Love gives me the brightest Shine, My Happiness is now completed, Since all that's generous, great and fine, In my Brigantius is united; For which I'll study thy Delight, With kindly Tale the Time beguiling, And round the Change of Day and Night; Fix throughout Life a constant smiling. Chorus. O the happy, &amp;c. Jenny Nettles. Saw ye Jenny Nettles, Jenny Nettles, Jenny Nettles, Saw ye Jenny Nettles Coming frae the Market; Bag and Baggage on her Back, Her Fee and Bountith in her Lap; Bag and Baggage on her Back, And a Babie in her Oxter. I met ayont the Kairny, Jenny Nettles, Jenny Nettles, Singing till her Bairny, Robin Rattles' Bastard; To flee the Dool upo' the Stool, And ilka ane that mocks her, She round about seeks Robin out, To stap it in his Oxter. Fy, fy! Robin Rattle, Robin Rattle, Robin Rattle; Fy, fy! Robin Rattle, Use Jenny Nettles kindly: Score out the Blame, and shun the Shame, And without mair Debate o't, Take hame your Wain, make Jenny fain, The leal and leesome Gate o't. For the Sake of Some-body. For the Sake of Some-body, For the Sake of Some-body; I cou'd wake a Winter Night, For the Sake of Some-body: I am gawn to seek a Wife, I am gawn to buy a Plaidy; I have three Stane of Woo, Carling, Is thy Daughter ready? For the Sake of Some-body, &amp;c. Betty, Lassy, say't thy sell, Tho' thy Dame be ill to shoo, First we'll buckle, then we'll tell, Let her flyte and syne come too: What signifies a Mither's Gloom, When Love and Kisses come in Play? Shou'd we wither in our Bloom, And in Simmer mak nae Hay? For the Sake, &amp;c. She. Bony Lad, I carena by, Tho' I try my Luck with thee, Since ye are content to tye The Haff-mark Bridal Band wi' me; I'll slip hame and wash my Feet, And steal on Linnings fair and clean, Syne at the trysting Place we'll meet, To do but what my Dame has done. For the Sake, &amp;c. He. Now my lovely Betty gives Consent in sic a heartsome Gate, It me frae a' my Care relieves, And Doubts that gart me aft look blate: Then let us gang and get the Grace, For they that have an Apetite Shou'd eat:—And Lovers shou'd embrace; If these be Faults, 'tis Nature's Wyte. For the Sake, &amp;c. THE GENEROUS GENTLEMAN. A SANG to the Tune of, The bony Lass of Branksom As I came in by Tiviot Side, And by the Braes of Branksom, There first I saw my bony Bride, Young, smiling, sweet and handsome: Her Skin was safter than the Down, And white as Alabastar; Her Hair a shining wavy Brown; In Straightness nane surpast her; Life glow'd upon her Lip and Cheek, Her clear Een were surprising, And beautifully turn'd her Neck, Her little Breasts just rising: Nae Silken Hose, with Gooshets fine, Or Shoon with glancing Laces, On her fair Leg, forbad to shine, Well shapen native Graces. Ae little Coat, and Bodice white, Was Sum of a' her Claithing; Even these o'er mickle; . . . mair Delyte She'd given cled wi' naithing: She leand upon a flowry Brae, By which a Burny troted; On her I glowr'd my Saul away, While on her Sweets I doated. A thousand Beauties of Desert, Before had scarce allarm'd me, 'Till this dear Artless struck my Heart, And bot designing, charm'd me. Hurry'd by Love, close to my Breast I grasp'd this Fund of Blisses: Wha smil'd, and said, Without a Priest, Sir, hope for nought but Kisses. I had nae Heart to do her Harm, And yet I coudna want her; What she demanded, ilka Charm Of her's pled, I shou'd grant her. Since Heaven had dealt to me a Rowth, Straight to the Kirk I led her, There plighted her my Faith and Trowth, And a young Lady made her. The Cock Laird A Cock Laird fou cadgie, With Jenny did meet, He haws'd her, he kiss'd her And ca'd her his Sweet. Wilt thou gae alang Wi' me, Jenny, Jenny? Thou'se be my ain Lemmane, Jo Jenny, quoth he. If I gae alang w'ye, Ye mauna fail, To feast me with Cadells And good Hacket-kail. The Deel's in your Nicety, Jenny, quoth he, Mayna Bannocks of Bear-meal Be as good for thee. And I maun hae Pinners, With Pearling set round, A Skirt of Puddy, And a wastcoat of broun. Awa with sic Vanities, Jenny, quoth he, For Kurchies and Kirtles Are fitter for thee. My Lairdship can yield me As meikle a Year, As had us in Pottage And good knockit Beer: But having nae Tenants, O Jenny, Jenny, To buy ought I ne'er have A Penny, quoth he. The Borrowstoun Merchants Will sell ye on Tick, For we man hae braw Things, Abiet they soud break, When broken, frae Care The Fools are set free, When we make them Lairds In the Abbey, quoth she. SONGS INSERTED IN THE GENTLE SHEPHERD [1725–34] The following SONGS to be sung in their proper Places on the acting of the Gentle Shepherd, at each the Page marked where they come in. SANG I. The wawking of the Faulds Sung by Patie, Page 1. [P. 213, l. 6.] My Peggy is a young thing, Just enter'd in her teens, Fair as the day, and sweet as May, Fair as the day, and always gay. My Peggy is a young thing, And I'm not very auld, Yet well I like to meet her at The wawking of the fauld. My Peggy speaks sae sweetly, When e'er we meet alane. I wish nae mair, to lay my care, I wish nae mair, of a' that's rare. My Peggy speaks sae sweetly, To a' the lave I'm cauld; But she gars a' my spirits glow At wawking of the fauld. My Peggy smiles sae kindly, Whene'er I whisper love, That I look down on a' the town, That I look down upon a crown. My Peggy smiles sae kindly, It makes me blyth and bauld. And naithing gi'es me sic delight, As wawking of the fauld. My Peggy sings sae saftly, When on my pipe I play; By a' the rest, it is confest, By a' the rest, that she sings best, My Peggy sings sae saftly, And in her sangs are tald, With innocence the wale of sense, At wawking of the fauld. SANG II. Fy gar rub her o'er with Strae sung by Patie, p. 6. [P. 217, l. 142.] Dear Roger, if your Jenny geck, And answer kindness with a slight, Seem unconcern'd at her neglect, For women in a man delight; But them dispise who're soon defeat, And with a simple face give way To a repulse—then be not blate, Push bauldly on, and win the day. When maidens, innocently young, Say atten what they never mean; Ne'er mind their pretty lying tongue; But tent the language of their een: If these agree, and she persist To answer all your love with hate, Seek elsewhere to be better blest, And let her sigh when 'tis too late. SANG III. Polwart on the Green. Sung by Peggy, p. 10. [P. 220, l. 53.] The dorty will repent, If lover's heart grow cauld, And nane her smiles will tent, Soon as her face looks auld: The dawted bairn thus takes the pet, Nor eats, tho' hunger crave, Whimpers and tarrows at its meat, And's laught at by the lave, They jest it till the dinner's past, Thus by it sell abus'd, The fool thing is oblig'd to fast, Or eat what they've refus'd. SANG IV. O dear Mother, what shall I do? Sung by Jenny p. 11. [P. 220, l. 71.] O dear Peggy love's beguiling, We ought not to trust his smiling. Better far to do as I do, Lest a harder luck betyde you. Lasses when their fancy's carried, Think of nought but to be married; Running to a life destroys Heartsome, free, and youthfu' joys. SANG V. How can I be sad on my Wedding-Day. Sung by Peggy, p. 12. [P. 221, l. 117.] How shall I be sad when a husband I hae, That has better sense than any of thae Sour weal silly fellows, that study like fools To sink their ain joy, and make their wives snools. The man who is prudent ne'er lightlies his wife, Or with dull reproaches encourages strife; He praises her virtues, and ne'er will abuse Her for a small failing, but find an excuse. SANG VI. Nansy's to the Green Wood gane. Sung by Jenny, p. 15. [P. 224, l. 205.] I yield, dear lassie, you have won, And there is nae denying, That sure as light flows frae the Sun, Frae love proceeds complying; For a' that we can do or say, 'Gainst love nae thinker heeds us, They ken our bosoms lodge the fae, That by the heart-strings leads us. SANG VII. Cald Kale in Aberdeen Sung by Glaud or Symon, p. 18. [P. 226, l. 34.] Cauld be the rebel's cast, Oppressors base and bloody, I hope we'll see them at the last Strung a' up in a woody. Blest be he of worth and sense, And ever high his station, That bravely stands in the defence Of conscience, king and nation. SANG VIII. Mucking of Geordy's Byer. Sung by Symon, p. 19. [P. 226, l. 51.] The laird who in riches and honour Wad thrive, should be kindly and free, Nor rack the poor tenants, who labour To rise aboon poverty: Else like the pack horse that's unfother'd And burden'd, will tumble down faint; Thus virtue by hardship is smother'd, And rackers aft tine their rent. SANG IX. Carle and the King come. Sung by Mause, p. 24. [P. 230, l. 4.] [This is prefaced to Act II, Sc. III (S.T.S. Edition: Vol. II, p. 230). There is one variant: thou shalt for shalt thou in l. 9.] SANG X. Winter was cauld, and my Cleathing was thin. Sung by Peggy and Patie, p. 30. [P. 235, l. 76.] PEGGY. When first my dear laddie gade to the green hill, And I at ew-milking first seyd my young skill, To bear the milk-bowie, nae pain was to me, When I at the bughting forgather'd with thee. PATIE. When corn-riggs wav'd yellow, and blew hether-bells Bloom'd bonny on moorland and sweet rising fells, Nae birns, brier, or breckens, gave trouble to me, If I found the berries right ripen'd for thee. PEGGY. When thou ran, or wrestled, or putted the stane, And came aff the victor, my heart was ay fain: Thy ilka sport manly, gave pleasure to me; For nane can put, wrestle or run swift as thee. PATIE. Our Jenny sings saftly the Cowden Broom-Knows, And Rosie lilts sweetly the milking the ews; There's few Jenny Nettles like Nansy can sing, At throw the wood laddie, Bess gars our lugs ring: But when my dear Peggy sings with better skill, The boat-man, tweed-side, or the lass of the mill, 'Tis many times sweeter and pleasing to me; For tho' they sing nicely, they cannot like thee. PEGGY. How easy can lasses trow what they desire? And praises sae kindly increases love's fire; Give me still this pleasure, my study shall be To make my self better and sweeter for thee. Omitted here is SANG XI. By the delicious warmness of thy mouth. Sung by Patie and Peggy, p. 32, printed in the Pastoral; and in Tea-Table Miscellany, Vol. I. p. 151. [In S.T.S. Edition. Vol. I: pp. 183–4 and Vol. II: p. 236.] SANG XII. Happy Clown Sung by Sir William, p. 35. [P. 238, l. 48.] Hid from himself, now by the dawn He starts as fresh as roses blawn, And ranges o'er the heights and lawn, After his bleeting flocks. Healthful, and innocently gay He chants, and whistles out the day; Untaught to smile, and then betray, Like courtly weathercocks. Life happy from ambition free, Envy and vile hypocrisie, Where truth and love with joys agree, Unsullied with a crime: Unmov'd with what disturbs the great, In proping of their pride and state; He lives, and unafraid of fate, Contented spends his time. SANG XIII. Leith-Wynd. Sung by JENNY and ROGER p. 47. [P. 247, l. 73.] [JENNY] Were I assur'd you'll constant prove, You should nae mair complain, The easy maid beset with love, Few words will quickly gain; For I must own, now since you're free, This too fond heart of mine Has lang, a black-sole true to thee, Wish'd to be pair'd with thine. ROGER I'm happy now, ah! let my head Upon thy breast recline; The pleasure strikes me near-hand dead! Is Jenny then sae kind?— O let me briss thee to my heart! And round my arms entwine: Delytful thought; we'll never part! Come press thy mouth to mine. SANG XIV. O'er Bogie. Sung by Jenny, p. 48. [P. 247, l. 81.] Well I agree, ye're sure of me; Next to my father gae. Make him content to give consent, He'll hardly say you nay: For you have what he wad be at, And will commend you well, Since parents auld think love grows cauld, Where bairns want milk and meal. Shou'd he deny, I carena by, He'd contradict in vain. Tho' a' my kin had said and sworn, But thee I will have nane. Then never range, or learn to change, Like these in high degree: And if you prove faithful in love, You'll find nae fault in me. SANG XV. Wat ye wha I met Yestreen. Sung by Sir William, p. 54. (P. 252. Substituted for ll. 122–8.] Now from rusticity, and love, Whose flames but over lowly burn My gentle shepherd must be drove, His soul must take another turn: As the rough diamond from the mine, In breakings only shews its light. 'Till polishing has made it shine, Thus learning makes the genius bright. SANG XVI. Kirk wad let me be. Sung by Patie, p. 63. [P. 258, l. 42.] Duty and part of reason, Plead strong on the parents side, Which love superior calls treason; The strongest must be obey'd: For now tho' I'm one of the gentry, My constancy falshood repells; For change in my heart is no entry, Still there my dear Peggy excells. SANG XVII. Woes my heart that we shou'd sunder. Sung by Peggy, p. 67. [P. 261, l. 149: as alternative to ll. 130–149.] Speak on,—speak thus, and still my grief, Hold up a heart that's sinking under These fears, that soon will want relief, When Pate must from Peggy sunder. A gentler face and silk attire, A lady rich in beauty's blossom, Alake poor me! will now conspire, To steal thee from thy Peggy's bosom. No more the shepherd who excell'd The rest, whose wit made them to wonder, Shall now his Peggy's praises tell, Ah! I can die, but never sunder. Ye meadows where we often stray'd, Ye banks where we were wont to wander. Sweet scented rucks round which we play'd, You'll loss your sweets when we're asunder. Again ah! shall I never creep Around the know with silent duty, Kindly to watch thee while asleep, And wonder at thy manly beauty? Hear, heaven, while solemnly I vow, Tho' thou shouldst prove a wandering lover, Throw life to thee I shall prove true, Nor be a wife to any other. SANG XVIII. Tweed-side. Sung by Peggy, p. 68. [P. 262, l. 174: as alternative to ll. 163–174.] When hope was quite sunk in despair, My heart it was going to break; My life appear'd worthless my care, But now I will sav't for thy sake. Where'er my love travels by day, Wherever he lodges by night, With me his dear image shall stay, And my soul keep him e'er in sight. With patience I'll wait the long year, And study the gentlest charms; Hope time away till thou appear, To lock thee for ay in those arms. Whilst thou wast a shepherd, I priz'd No higher degree in this life; But now I'll endeavour to rise To a height is becoming thy wife. For beauty that's only skin deep, Must fade like the gowans of May, But inwardly rooted, will keep For ever, without a decay. Nor age, nor the changes of life, Can quench the fair fire of love, If virtue's ingrain'd in the wife, And the husband have sense to approve. SANG XIX. Bush aboon Traquair. Sung by Peggy, p. 70. [P. 263, l. 209: as alternative to ll. 202–9.] At setting day and rising morn, With soul that still shall love thee, I'll ask of heaven thy safe return, With all that can improve thee. I'll visit oft the birken-bush, Where first thou kindly told me, Sweet tales of love, and hid my blush, Whilst round thou didst enfold me. To all our haunts I will repair, By greenwood-shaw or fountain; Or where the summer-day I'd share With thee, upon yon mountain. There will I tell the trees and flowers, From thoughts unfeign'd and tender. By vows you're mine, by love is yours A heart which cannot wander. SANG XX. Bony gray ey'd Morn. Sung by Sir William, p. 74. [P. 266, l. 85.] The bony gray eyed morning begins to peep, And darkness flys before the rising ray, The hearty hynd starts from his lazy sleep, To follow healthful labours of the day, Without a guilty sting to wrinkle his brow, The lark and the linnet tend his levee, And he joins their concert, driving his plow, From toil of grimace and pageantry free. While fluster'd with wine, or madden'd with loss, Of half an estate, the prey of a main, The drunkard and gamester tumble and toss, Wishing for calmness and slumber in vain. Be my portion health and quietness of mind, Plac'd at due distance from parties and state, Where neither ambition or avarice blind, Reach him who has happiness link'd to his fate. From The Tea-Table Miscellany [1729] On our Ladies being dressed in SCOTS Manufactory at a publick Assembly. A SONG To the Tune of, O'er the Hills and far away. Let meaner beauties use their art, And range both Indies for their dress. Our fair can captivate the heart, In native weeds, nor look the less. More bright unborrowed beauties shine, The artless sweetness of each face Sparkle with lustres more divine, When freed of every foreign grace. The tawny nymph on scorching plains, May use the aid of gems and paint, Deck with brocade and Tyrian stains Features of ruder form and taint. What Caledonian ladies wear, Or from the lint or woolen twine, Adorn'd by all their sweets, appear What e'er we can imagine fine. Apparel neat become the fair, The dirty dress may lovers cool, But clean, our maids need have no care, If clade in linnen, silk, or wool. T'adore Myrtilla, who can cease? Her active charms our praise demand, Clad in a mantua, from the fleece, Spun by her own delightful hand. Who can behold Calista's eyes, Her breast, her cheek, and snowy arms, And mind what artists can devise, To rival more superior charms? Compar'd with those, the diamond's dull, Launs, satins, and the velvet's fade, The soul with her attractions full, Can never be by these betray'd. SAPHIRA, all o'er native sweets, Not the false glare of dress regards, Her wit, her character completes, Her smile her lovers sighs rewards, When such first beauties lead the way, The inferior rank will follow soon; Then arts no longer shall decay, But trade encouraged be in tune. Millions of fleeces shall be wove, And flax that on the valeys blooms, Shall make the naked nations love, And bless the labours of our looms; We have enough, nor want from them, But trifles hardly worth our care, Yet for these trifles let them claim What food and cloath we have to spare. How happy's Scotland in her Fair! Her amiable daughters shall, By acting thus with virtuous care, Again the golden age recal: Enjoying them, Edina ne'er Shall miss a court; but soon advance In wealth, when thus the lov'd appear Around the scenes, or in the dance. Barbarity shall yield to sense, And lazy pride to useful arts, When such dear angels, in defence Of virtue thus engage their hearts. Blest guardians of our joys and wealth, True fountains of delight and love, Long bloom your charms, fixt be your health, 'Till tir'd with earth, you mount above. From The Evergreen [1724] THE VISION Compylit in Latin be a most lernit Clerk The History of the Scots Sufferings, by the unworthy Condescension of Baliol to Edward I of England, till they recovered their Independence by the Conduct and Valour of the Great BRUCE, is so universally known, that any Argument to this antique Poem seems useless. in Tyme of our Hairship and Oppression, anno 1300, and translatit in 1524. I Bedoun the Bents of Banquo Brae Milane I wandert waif and wae, Musand our main Mischaunce; How be thay Faes we ar undone, That staw the sacred The old Chair (now in Westminster Abbey) in which the Scots Kings were always crown'd, wherein there is a Piece of Marble with this Inscription; Ni fallat fatum, SCOTI, quocunque locatum Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem. Stane frae Scone, And leids us sic a Daunce: Quhyle Inglands Edert taks our Tours, And Scotland ferst obeys, Rude Ruffians ransakk Ryal Bours, And Baliol Homage pays; Throch Feidom our Freidom Is blotit with this Skore, Quhat Romans or no Mans Pith culd eir do befoir II The Air grew ruch with bousteous Thuds, Bauld Boreas branglit outthrow the Cluds, Maist lyke a drunken Wicht; The Thunder crakt, and Flauchts did rift Frae the blak Vissart of the Lift: The Forrest schuke with Fricht; Nae Birds abune thair Wing extenn, They ducht not byde the Blast, Ilk Beist bedeen bangd to thair Den, Until the Storm was past: Ilk Creature in Nature That had a Spunk of Sence, In Neid then, with Speid then, Methocht cryt, in Defence. III To se a Morn in May sae ill, I deimt Dame Nature was gane will, To rair with rackles Reil; Quhairfor to put me out of Pain, And skonce my Skap and Shanks frae Rain, I bure me to a Beil, Up ane hich Craig that lundgit alaft, Out owre a canny Cave, A curious Cruif of Natures Craft, Quhilk to me Schelter gaif; Ther vexit, perplexit, I leint me doun to weip, In brief ther, with Grief ther I dottard owre on Sleip. IV Heir Somnus in his silent Hand Held all my Sences at Command, Quhyle I forzet my Cair; The myldest Meid of mortall Wichts Quha pass in Peace the private Nichts, That wauking finds it rare; Sae in saft Slumbers did I ly, But not my wakryfe Mynd, Quhilk still stude Watch, and couth espy A Man with Aspeck kynd, Richt auld lyke and bauld lyke, With Baird thre Quarters skant, Sae braif lyke and graif lyke, He seemt to be a Sanct.

May Cheins then, and Pains then Infernal be thair Hyre Quha dang us, and flang us Into this ugsum Myre. XI Then he with bauld forbidding Luke, And staitly Air did me rebuke, For being of Sprite sae mein: Said he its far beneath a Scot To use weak Curses quhen his Lot May sumtyms sour his Splein, He rather sould mair lyke a Man, Some braif Design attempt; Gif its nocht in his Pith, what than, Rest but a Quhyle content, Nocht feirful, but cheirful, And wait the Will of Fate, Which mynds to desygns to Renew zour auntient State.

XIV Quhen all zour Trade is at a Stand, And Cunzie clene forsaiks the Land, Quhilk will be very sune, Will Preists without their Stypands preich For nocht will Lawyers Causes Streich; Faith thatis nae easy done. All this and mair maun cum to pass, To cleir zour glamourit Sicht; And Scotland maun be made an Ass To set her Jugment richt. Theyil jade hir and blad hir, Untill scho brak hir Tether, Thocht auld schois zit bauld schois, And teuch lyke barkit Lether. XV But mony a Corss sall braithles ly, And Wae sall mony a Widow cry, Or all rin richt again; Owre Cheviot prancing proudly North, The Faes sall tak the Feild neir Forthe, And think the Day their ain: But Burns that Day sall rin with Blude Of them that now oppress; Thair Carcasses be Corbys Fude, By thousands on the Gress. A King then sall ring then, Of wyse Renoun and braif, Quhase Pusians and Sapiens, Sall Richt restoir and saif. XVI The View of Freidomis sweit, quod I, O say, grit Tennant of the Skye, How neiris that happie Tyme. We ken Things but be Circumstans, Nae mair, quod he, I may advance, Leist I commit a Cryme. Quhat eir ze pleis, gae on, quod I, I sall not fash ze moir, Say how, and quhair ze met, and quhy, As ze did hint befoir. With Air then sae fair then, That glanst like Rayis of Glory, Sae Godlyk and oddlyk He thus resumit his Storie. XVII Frae the Suns Rysing to his Sett, All the pryme Rait of Wardens met, In solemn bricht Array, With Vehicles of Aither cleir, Sic we put on quhen we appeir To Sauls rowit up in Clay; Thair in a wyde and splendit Hall, Reird up with shynand Beims, Quhais Rufe-treis wer of Rainbows all, And paist with starrie Gleims, Quhilk prinked and twinkled Brichtly beyont Compair, Much famed and named A Castill in the Air. XVIII In midst of quhilk a Tabill stude, A spacious Oval reid as Blude, Made of a Fyre-Flaucht, Arround the dazeling Walls were drawn, With Rays be a celestial Hand, Full mony a curious Draucht. Inferiour Beings flew in Haist, Without Gyd or Derectour, Millions of Myles throch the wyld Waste, To bring in Bowlis of Nectar: Then roundly and soundly We drank lyk Roman Gods; Quhen Jove sae dois rove sae, That Mars and Bacchus nods. XIX Quhen Phebus Heid turns licht as Cork, And Neptune leans upon his Fork, And limpand Vulcan blethers: Quhen Pluto glowrs as he were wyld, And Cupid luves we wingit Chyld, Fals down and fyls his Fethers. Quhen Pan forzets to tune his Reid, And slings it cairless bye, And Hermes wingd at Heils and Heid, Can nowther stand nor lye: Quhen staggirand and swaggirand, They stoyter Hame to sleip, Quhyle Centeries at Enteries Imortal Watches keip. XX Thus we tuke in the high browin Liquour, And bangd about the Nectar Biquour; But evir with his Ods: We neir in Drink our Judgments drensch, Nor scour about to seik a Wensch Lyk these auld baudy Gods, But franklie at ilk uther ask, Quhats proper we suld know, How ilk ane hes performt the Task, Assigned to him below. Our Minds then sae kind then, Are fixt upon our Care, Ay noting and ploting Quhat tends to thair Weilfair. XXI Gothus and Vandall baith lukt bluff, Quhyle Gallus sneerd and tuke a Snuff, Quhilk made Allmane to stare; Latinus bad him naithing feir, But lend his Hand to haly Weir, And of cowd Crouns tak Care; Batavius with his Paddock-Face Luking asquint, cryd, Pisch, Zour Monks ar void of Sence or Grace, I had leur ficht for Fisch; Zour Schule-men ar Fule-men, Carvit out for dull Debates, Decoying and destroying Baith Monarchies and States. XXII Iberius with a gurlie Nod Cryd, Hogan, zes we ken zour God, Its Herrings ze adore; Heptarchus, as he usd to be, Can nocht with his ain Thochts agre, But varies bak and fore; Ane quhyle he says, It is not richt A Monarch to resist, Neist Braith all Ryall Powir will slicht, And passive Homage jest; He hitches and fitches Betwein the Hic and Hoc, Ay jieand and flieand Round lyk a Wedder-cock. XXIII I still support my Precedens Abune them all, for Sword and Sens, Thocht I haif layn richt now lown, Quhylk was, becaus I bure a Grudge At sum fule Scotis, quha lykd to drudge To Princes no thair awin; Sum Thanis thair Tennants pykit and squeist, And pursit up all thair Rent, Syne wallopit to far Courts, and bleist, Till Riggs and Schaws war spent; Syne byndging and whyndging, Quhen thus redusit to Howps, They dander and wander About pure Lickmadowps. XXIV But now its Tyme for me to draw My shynand Sword against Club-Law, And gar my Lyon roir; He sall or lang gie sic a Sound, The Ecchoe sall be hard arround Europe, frae Schore to Schore; Then lat them gadder all thair Strenth, And stryve to wirk my Fall, Tho numerous, zit at the lenth I will owrecum them all, And raise zit and blaze zit My Braifrie and Renown, By gracing and placing Arright the Scottis Crown. XXV Quhen my braif Bruce the same sall weir Upon his Ryal Heid, full cleir The Diadem will shyne; Then sall zour sair Oppression ceis, His Intrest zours he will not fleice, Or leif zou eir inclyne: Thocht Millions to his Purse be lent, Zell neir the puirer be, But rather richer, quhyle its spent Within the Scottish Se: The Field then sall zeild then To honest Husbands Welth, Gude Laws then sall cause then A sickly State haif Helth. XXVI Quhyle thus he talkit, methocht ther came A wondir fair Etherial Dame, And to our Warden sayd, Grit Callidon I cum in Serch Of zou, frae the hych starry Arch, The Counsill wants zour Ayd; Frae every Quarter of the Sky, As swift as Quhirl-wynd, With Spirits speid the Chiftains hy, Sum grit Thing is desygnd Owre Muntains be Funtains, And round ilk fairy Ring, I haif chaist ze, O haist ze, They talk about zour King. XXVII With that my Hand methocht he schuke, And wischt I Happyness micht bruke, To eild be Nicht and Day; Syne quicker than an Arrows Flicht, He mountit upwarts frae my Sicht, Straicht to the milkie Way; My Mynd him followit throw the Skyes, Untill the brynie Streme For Joy ran trinckling frae myne Eyes, And wakit me frae Dreme; Then peiping, half sleiping, Frae furth my rural Beild, It eisit me and pleisit me To se and smell the Feild. XXVIII For Flora in hir clene Array, New washen with a Showir of May, Lukit full sweit and fair; Quhyle hir cleir Husband frae aboif Sched doun his Rayis of genial Luve, Hir Sweits perfumt the Air; The Winds war husht, the Welkin cleird, The glumand Clouds war fled, And all as saft and gay appeird As ane Elysion Sched; Quhilk heisit and bleisit My Heart with sic a Fyre, As raises these Praises That do to Heaven aspyre. Quod Ar. Scot. THE Eagle and Robin Red-breist The Prince of all the fethert Kynd, That with spred Wings out fleis the Wind, And tours far out of humane Sicht To view the schynand Orb of Licht: This Ryall Bird, tho braif and great, And armit strang for stern Debait, Nae Tyrant is but condescends Aftymes to treit inferiour Friends. Ane Day at his Command did flock To his hie Palace on a Rock, The Courtiers of ilk various Syze That swiftly swim in Christal Skyis; Thither the valiant Tersals doup, And heir rapacious Corbies croup, With greidy Gleds and slie Gormahs, And dinsome Pyis and clatterin Daws; Proud Pecocks, and a hundred mae, Bruscht up thair Pens that solemn Day, Bowd first submissive to my Lord, Then tuke thair Places at his Borde. Mein Tyme quhyle feisting on a Fawn, And drinking Blude frae Lamies drawn, A tunefull Robin trig and zung, Hard by upon a Bour-tree sung. He sang the Eagles Ryall Lyne, His persing Ee and Richt divyne, To sway out-owre the fetherit Thrang, Quha dreid his martial Bill and sang: His Flicht sublime, and Eild renewit, His Mynd with Clemencie endewit; In safter Notes he sang his Luve, Mair hie his beiring Bolts for Jove. The Monarch Bird with Blythness hard The chaunting litil Silvan Bard, Calit up a Buzart, quha was than His Favourite and Chamberlane. Swith to my Treasury, quod he, And to zon canty Robin gie As mekle of our currant Geir As may mentain him throw the Zeir; We can weil spairt, and its his Due, He bad, and furth the Judas flew, Straight to the Brench quhair Robin sung, And with a wickit lieand Tung, Said, Ah! ze sing sae dull and ruch, Ze haif deivt our Lugs mair than enuch, His Majestie hes a nyse Eir, And nae mair of zour Stuff can beir; Poke up zour Pypes, be nae mair sene At Court, I warn ze as a Frein. He spak, quhyle Robinis swelling Breist, And drouping Wings his Greif, The Teirs ran happing doun his Cheik, Grit grew his Hairt, he could nocht speik, No for the Tinsell of Rewaird, But that his Notis met nae Regaird; Straicht to the Schaw he spred his Wing, Resolvit again nae mair to sing, Quhair Princelie Bountie is supprest, By sic with quhome they are opprest, Quha cannot beir (because they want it) That ocht suld be to Merit grantit.

AN ODE Sacred to the MEMORY Of Her Grace ANNE Dutchess of HAMILTON. Let Angels with their silver Wings o'ershade, The Ground now sacred by her Reliques made. Pope. Why sounds the Plain with sad Complaint? Why hides the Sun his Beams? Why sighs the Winds sae bleak and cauld? Why mourn the swelling Streams? Wail on ye Heights, ye Glens complain, Sun wear thy cloudy Veil: Sigh Winds frae frozen Caves of Snaw; Clyde mourn the rueful Tale. She's dead, the Beauteous Anna's dead, All Nature wears a Gloom: Alas! the comely budding Flower, Is faded in the Bloom. Clos'd in the weeping Marble Vault, Now cauld and blae she lies, Nae mair the Smiles adorn her Cheek, Nae mair she lifts her Eyes. Too soon, O sweetest, fairest, best; Young Parent, lovely Mate, Thou leaves thy LORD and Infant SON, To weep thy early Fate. But late thy chearfu' Marriage-Day, Gave Gladness all around; But late in thee, the youthful Chief, A Heaven of Blessings found. His Bosom swells, for much he lov'd, Words fail to paint his Greif; He starts in Dream, and grasps thy Shade, The Day brings nae Relief. The fair Illusion skims away, And Grief again returns, Life's Pleasure make a vain Attempt, Disconsolate he mourns: He mourns his Loss, a Nation's Loss, It claims a Flood of Tears; When sic a lov'd illustrious Star, Sae quickly disappears. With Roses and the Lilly Buds, Ye Nymphs her Grave adorn, And weeping tell, thus Sweet she was, Thus early from us Torn. To silent Twilight Shades retire, Ye melancholy Swains, In melting Notes repete her Praise, In sighing vent your Pains. But haste, calm Reason, to our Aid, And paining Thoughts subdue, By placing of the pious Fair, In a mair pleasing View. Whose white immortal Mind now shines, And shall for ever bright, Above th'Insult of Death and Pain, By the first Spring of Light. There joins the high melodious Thrang, That strike eternal Strings; In Presence of Omnipotence, She now a Seraph sings. Then cease Great JAMES thy flowing Tears, Nor rent thy Soul in vain: Frae Bowers of Bless she'll ne'er return To thy kind Arms again. With Goodness still adorn thy Mind, True Greatness still improve; Be still a PATRIOT, just and brave, And meet thy SAINT above. A.R. From Poems in English and Latin on the Archers and Royal Company of Archers [1726] The POET'S Thanks to the ARCHERS, on being admitted into their Royal Company. The restless Mind of Man ne'er tyres, To please his favourite Desires, He chiefly that to Fame aspires, With Soul enlarg'd grasps with Delight At every Favour, which conspires To place him in a proper Light. Such are the Followers of the Nine, Who aim at Glory for Reward; Whose flowing Fancies brighter shine, When from the Best they meet Regard. I not the least now of that Train Who frae the Royal Archers gain Applause, while lovely Ladies deign To take me too beneath their Care: Then tho' I boast, I am not vain, Thus guarded by the Brave and Fair. For which kind Fate to me this Day, First to the Powers supreme I bow; And next, my Gratitude I pay, Brave Sons of Caledon, to you. ALLAN RAMSAY The ARCHERS March. I Sound, sound the Musick, sound it, Let Hills and Dales rebound it, Let Hills and Dales rebound it, In Praise of Archery. It's Origin Divine is, The Practice brave and fine is, Which gen'rously inclines us To guard our Liberty. II Art by the Gods imployed, By which Heroes enjoyed, By which Heroes enjoyed The Wreaths of Victory. The Deity of Parnassus, The God of soft Caresses, Diana and her Lasses Delight in Archery. III See, see yon Bow extended! 'Tis Jove himself that bends it. 'Tis Jove himself that bends it, O'er Clouds on high it glows. All Nations, Turks and Parthians, The Tartars and the Scythians The Arabs, Moors and Indians, With Bravery draw their Bows. IV Our own true Records tell us, That none cou'd e'er excell us, That none cou'd e'er excell us, In martial Archery. With Shafts our Sires engaging, Oppos'd the Romans Raging, Defeat the fierce Norwegian, And spared few Danes to flee. V Witness the Largs and Loncartie, Dunkeld and Aberlemno, Dunkeld and Aberlemno, Rosline and Bannockburn. The Chiviots, . . . all the Border, Where Bowmen in brave Order, Told Enemies, if furder They mov'd, they'd ne'er return. Largs, where the Norwegians, headed by their valiant King Haco, were in Anno 1263, totally defeat by Alexander III King of Scots; the heroick Alexander, Great-Steward of Scotland, commanded the right Wing. Loncartie, near Perth, where King Kenneth III obtained the Victory over the Danes, which was principally owing to the Valour and Resolution of the first brave Hay, and his two Sons. Dunkel, here, and in Kyle, and on the Banks of Tay, our great King Corbredus Galdus in three Battles overthrew 30000 Romans in the Reign of the Emperor Domitian. Aberlemny, four Miles from Brechin, where King Malcolm II obtained a glorious Victory over the united Armies of Danes, Norwegians and Cumbrians, &amp;c commanded by Sueno King of Denmark, and his warlike Son Prince Canute. Rosline, within five Miles South of Edinburgh, where 10000 Scots, led by Sir John Cumin and Sir Simon Frazer, defeat in three Battles in one Day 30000 of their Enemies, Anno 1303. The Battles of Bannockburn and Chiviot, &amp;c are so well known, that they require no Notes. VI Sound, sound the Musick, sound it, Let Hills and Dales rebound it, Let Hills and Dales rebound it, In Praise of Archery. Us'd as a Game it pleases, The Mind to Joy it raises, And throws off all Diseases Of lazy Luxury. VII Now, now our Care beguiling, When all the Year looks smiling, When all the Year looks smiling With healthful Harmony. The Sun in Glory glowing, With Morning Dew bestowing Sweet Fragrance, Life and Growing To Flowers and every Tree. VIII 'Tis now the Archers royal, An hearty Band and loyal, An hearty Band and loyal, That in just Thoughts agree, Appear in ancient Bravery, Despising all base Knavery, Which tends to bring in Slavery Souls worthy to live free. IX Sound, sound the Musick, sound it, Fill up the Glass and round wi't, Fill up the Glass and round wi't: Health and Prosperity To our Great CHIEF and Officers, To our President and Counsellors; To all who, like their brave Forbears, Delight in Archery. From The Caledonian Mercury: July 12, 1726. A POEM ON THE ROYAL COMPANY OF ARCHERS See how the bright extended Line Of Royal Archers shape their Way, Resembling in their Arms divine The Glories of the God of Day. Their Martial Worth o'er all the Globe does roll As Phoebus darts his Beams from Pole to Pole. Their Great Forefathers sought the Field, Not doubting of their Arm's Success; They made insulting Foes to yield, Who, lab'ring to be great, grew less, The Roman Eagle, towring to the skies, Pierc'd by their ARROWS, reeling sinks and dies. Let this Example fire your Blood To Deeds becoming Scotia's Race. Be studious to be great and good, By Means untainted by Disgrace Nobly assert your King and Country's Cause; Retrieve her Honour; vindicate her Laws. Thus will Old Caledon regain That Vigour which would seem to sink; Our RAMPANT LYON break his Chain, Undoing each disgraceful Link. No more we'll hear the Noble Savage moan But see him scowre the Plains were heretofore his own. From Poems [1729] The Callan and the Pig Deep in a narrow craiged Pig Lay mony a dainty Nut and Fig. A greedy Callan, haf a Sot, Shot his wee Nive into the Pot, And thought to bring as mony out As a' his Fangs cou'd gang about; But the strait Neck o't wadna suffer The Hand of this young foolish Truffer, Sae struted, to return again, Which gae the Gowkie nae sma' Pain. He gowls to be sae disappointed, And drugs till he has 'maist disjointed, His Shekelbane.—Anither Lad Stood by, wha some mair Judgment had, Said, Billy, dinna grip at a', And you with Ease, a Part may draw. This same Advice, to Men I'd lend, Ne'er for o'er much at anes contend, But take the cannyest Gate to Ease, And pike out Joys by Twa's and Three's. The Man with the twa Wives. In antient Tales, there is a Story, Of ane had twa Wives, Whig and Tory. The Carlie's Head, was now attir'd With Hair, in equal Mixture, lyart. His Wives (Faith an might well suffic'd) Alternately was ay ill pleas'd; They being reverse to ane another In Age and Faith, made a curs'd Pother Whilk of the twa shou'd bear the Bell, And make their Man maist like themsell. Auld Meg, the Tory, took great Care, To weed out ilka Sable Hair, Plucking out all that look'd like Youth, Frae Crown of Head, to Weeks of Mouth; Saying, That baith in Head and Face Antiquity was Mark of Grace. But Bess, the Whig, a Raving Rump, Took Figmaliries, and wald jump, With Sword and Pistol, by her Side, And Cock-a-stride arowing ride, On the Hag-riden Sumph, and grapple Him hard and fast about the Thraple; And with her furious Fingers whirle, Frae youthfu' Black ilk Silver Curle. Thus was he serv'd between the twa, 'Till no ae Hair he had ava. MORAL The Moral of this Fable's easy, But I sall speak it out to please ye. 'Tis and auld Saying and a trow, Between twa Stools the Arse fa's throw. Thus Britain's Morals are much plucked, While by two opposites instructed: Who still contending have the Trick, The strongest Truths to contradict; Tho' Orthodox, they'll Error make it, If Party opposite has spake it. Thus are we keytch'd between the twa, Like to turn Deists, ane and a'. Fable of the Condemn'd Ass. A dreadful Plague, the like was sindle seen, Coost mony a Beast, Wame upwards on the Green: By thousands down to Acheron they sank, To dander Ages on the dowie Bank; Because they lay unburied on the Sward, The sick Survivers cou'dna give them Eard. The Wowf and Tod, with sighing spent the Day: Their sickly Stamacks scunner'd at the Prey: Fowls droop the Wing, the Bull neglects his Love: Scarce crawl the Sheep, and weakly Horses move. The bauldest Brute, that haunt Numidian Glens, Ly panting out their Lives in dreary Dens. Thick lay the dead, and thick the pain'd and weak, The Prospect gart the awfu' Lyon quake. He ca's a Council.—Ah! my Friends, said he, 'Tis for some horrid Faut sae mony die, Sae Heaven permits.—Then let us a' confess With open Breast, our Crimes baith mair and less; That the revengefu' Gods may be appeas'd, When the maist guilty Wight is sacrific'd. Fa't on the Feyest,—I shall first begin, And awn what e'er my Conscience ca's a Sin. The Sheep and Deer I've worried, now alace! Crying for Vengeance, glowr me i' the Face: Forby their Herd, poor Man! to Crown my Treat, Limb after Limb, with bloody Jaws I ate: Ah! Glutton me! what murders have I done!— Now say about, confess ilk ane as soon And frank as I.—Sire, says the pawky Tod, Your tenderness bespeaks you haf a God! Worthy to be the Monarch of the Grove, Worthy your Friends, and a' your Subjects Love. Your scruples are too nice.—What's Harts or Sheep An Idiot Crowd, which for your Board ye keep; And where's the Sin, for ane to take his ain, Faith 'tis their Honour, when by you they're slain. Neist, What's their Herd?—A Man! our deadly Fae, Wha o'er us Beasts, pretends a fancy'd Sway, And ne'er makes Banes o't, when 'tis in his Power, With Guns and Bows, our Nation to devour. He said.—and round the Courtiers all and each, Applauded Lawrie for his winsome Speech. The Tyger, Bair, and ev'ry powerfu' Fur, Down to the Wilcat, and the snarling Cur Confest their Crimes; but wha durst ca' them Crimes Except themsells.— The Ass, dull Thing! neist in his Turn confest, That being with Hunger very sair opprest, In o'er a Dike, he shot his Head ae Day, And rugg'd three Mouthfu's off a Ruck of Hay But speering Leave.—Said he, Some wicked Deil, Did tempt me frae the Parish Priest to steal. He said.—And all at ains, the powerfu' Croud, With open Throats cry'd hastily and loud, This Gypsie Ass, deserves ten Deaths to die, Whase horid Guilt, brings on our Misery. A gaping Wowf, in Office, straight demands, To have him burnt, or tear him where he stands: Hanging, he said, was an o'er easy Death, He shou'd in Tortures yield his latest Breath. What break a Bishops Yard! Ah crying Guilt! Which nought can expiate till his Blood be spilt.— The Lyon signs his Sentence, Hang and draw;— Sae poor lang Lugs maun pay the Kane for a'. Hence we may ken, how Power has eith the Knack, To whiten red, and gar the blew seem black; They'll start at Winle Straes, yet never crook, When Interest bids, to lowp out o'er a Stowk. The Gods of Egypt Langsyne in Egypt Beasts were Gods, Sae mony that the Men turn'd Beasts; Vermin and Brutes, but House or Hald, Had Offerings, Temples and their Priests. Ae Day a Rattan, white as Milk, At a Cat's Shrine was sacrific'd, And Pompous on the Altar bled: The Victim much God Badrans pleas'd. The neist Day was God Ratan's Tour; And that he might propitious Smile, A Cat is to his Temple brought, Priests singing round him a' the while. Odes, Anthems, Hymns, in Verse and Prose, With Instruments of solemn Sound, Praying the lang tail'd Diety [Sic] To bless their Faulds and furrow'd Ground. O plague us not with Cats they cry'd, For this we cut ane's Throat to Thee.— A bonny God, indeed! quoth Puss, Can ye believe sae great a Lie. What am I then, that eat your God, And Yesterday to me ye bow'd; This Day I'm to that Vermin offer'd, God save us! ye're a senseless Crowd. The close Reflection gart them glowr, And shook their Thoughts haf out of Joint; But rather than be fash'd with Thought, They gart the Ax decide the Point. Thus we're Egyptians ane and a', Our Passions Gods, that gar us swither, Which just as the Occasion serves, We sacrifice to ane anither. The Spectacles Ae Day when Jove, the High Director, Was merry o'er a Bowl of Nectar, Resolv'd a Present to bestow, On the Inhabitants below. Momus, wha likes his Joke and Wine, Was sent frae Heaven with the Propine: Fast throw the Aether-fields he whirl'd His rapid Car, and reach'd the Warld: Conveen'd Mankind, and told them Jove Had sent a Token of his Love, Considering that they were short sighted, That Faut shou'd presently be righted. Syne loos'd his Wallet frae the Pillions, And toss'd out Spectacles by Millions. There were enow, and ilk an chose, His Pair and cock'd them on his Nose: And thankfully their Knees they bended To Heaven, that thus their Sight had mended. Streight Momus hameward took his Flight, Laughing fou'd loud, as well he might. For ye maun ken, 'tis but o'er true, The Glasses were some Red, some Blue, Some Black, some White, some Brown, some Green, Which made the same Thing different seem. Now all was wrong, and all was right, For ilk believ'd his aided Sight, And did the Joys of Truth partake, In the absurdest gross Mistake. The Fox turn'd Preacher A THOUGHT A learned Fox grown stiff with Eild, Unable now in open Field, By Speed of Foot and clever Stends, To seize and worry Lambs and Hens; But Lowry never wants a Shift, To help him out at a dead Lift. He cleath'd himsell in Reverend Dress, And turn'd a Preacher.—Nathing less! Held forth wi' Birr, 'gainst Wier unjust, 'Gainst Theft and gormondizing Lust: Clear was his Voice, his Tone was sweet, In Zeal and Mien he seem'd complete; Sae grave and humble was his Air, His Character shin'd wide and fair. 'Tis said the Lyon had a Mind To hear him.—But Mess Fox declin'd That Honour.—Reasons on his Side, Said that might snare him into Pride. But Sheep and Powtry, Geese and Ducks, Came to his Meeting-Hole in Flocks: Of being his Prey, they had nae Fear; His Text the contrary made clear. Curst be that Animal voracious, Cry'd he, sae cruel and ungracious, That chuses Flesh to be his Food, And takes Delight in waughting Blood. What? live by Murder!—horrid Deed, While we have Trees, and ilka Mead, Finely enrich'd with Herbs and Fruits, To serve and please the nicest Brutes. We shou'd respect, Dearly Belov'd, What e'er by Breath of Life is mov'd. First, 'tis unjust, and Secondly, 'Tis Cruel—and a Cruelty, By which we are expos'd,—O sad! To eat perhaps our Lucky-dad; For ken, my Friend, the Saul ne'er dies, But frae the failing Body flies; Leaves it to rot, and seeks anither: Thus young Miss Goose may be my Mither. The bloody Wowf, seeking his Prey, His Father in a Sheep may slay; And I in worrying Lambs or Cocks, Might choak my Gransire Doctor Fox. Ah! Heaven protect me frae sic Crimes: I'd rather die a thousand Times. Thus our Bob-tail'd Pythagoras preach'd, And with loud Cant, his Lungs out-stretch'd. His Sermon sounded o'er the Dale, While thus he moraliz'd with Zeal. His Glass spun out,—He ceast, admir'd By all, who joyfully retir'd. But after a' the lave was gane, Some Geese, twa Chickens and a Hen, Thought fit to stay a little Space, To tawk about some kittle Case. The Doctor hem'd! and in he drew them, Then quiet and decently he slew them; On whom he fed the good auld Way. These who wan aff, thrice happy they. The Bee and the Fly Before his Hive, a paughty Bee, Observ'd a humble Midding Flie, And proudly speer'd what brought her there, And with what Front she durst repair, Amang the Regents of the Air. It sets ye well, the fly reply'd, To quarrel with sic sawcy Pride. Thay're daft indeed, has ought to do, With thrawin Contentious Fowk like you. Why, Scoundrel, you, return'd the Bee, What Nation is sae wise as we? Best Laws and Policy is ours, And our Repast the fragrant Flowers. No sordid nasty Trade we drive, But with Sweet Honey fill the Hive; Honey maist gratefu' to the Taste, On which the Gods themsells may feast. Out of my Sight, vile Wretch, whose Tongue Is daily slacking throw the Dung: Vile Spirits, filthily content To feed on stinking Excrement. The Fly replied, in sober Way, Faith we maun live as well's we may: Glad Poverty was ne'er a Vice, But sure, ill-natur'd Passion is. Your Honey's sweet; but then how tart, And bitter's your malicious Heart! In making Laws you copy Heaven, But in your Conduct how uneven! To fash at ony Time a Fae, Ye'll never stick ye'r Sells to slae; And skaith your sell mair sickerly, Than e'er ye can your Enemy. At that Rate, ane had better have Less Talents, if they can behave Discreet, and less their Passions slave. The Horse's Complaint Ah, what a wretch'd unlucky Corse Am I!—crys a poor Hireling Horse; Toil'd a' the Day quite aff my Feet, With little Time, or ought to eat; By break of Day up frae my Bed Of Dirt, I'm rais'd to draw the Sled, Or Cart, as haps to my Wanluck, To ca' in Coals or out the Muck; Or drest in Sadle, Howse, and Bridle, To Gallop with some Gamphrel idle, That for his Hiring Pint and Shilling, Obliges me, tho' maist unwilling, With Whip, and Spur sunk in my Side, O'er Heights and Hows all Day to ride, While he neglects my hungry Wame, 'Till aft I fa' and make him lame. Who curses me should ban himsell, He starv'd me, I with Faintness fell. How happy lives our Baron's Ape, That's good for nought, but girn and gape, Or round about the Lasses flee, And lift their Coats aboon their Knee; To frisk and jump frae Stool to Stool, Turn up his Bum, and play the Fool: Aft rives a Mutch, or steals a Spoon, And burns the Bairns' Hose and Shoon— Yet while I'm starving in the Stable, This Villain's cock'd upon the Table, There fed and roos'd by all around him,— By Foolish Chiels, the Pox confound them. My Friend, says a dowse headed Ox, Our Knight is e'en like other Folks: For 'tis not them who labour maist That commonly are paid the best. Then ne'er cast up what ye deserve, Since better 'tis to please than serve. The Parrat An honest Man had tint his Wife, And, wearied of a dowy Life, Thought a Perroquet bade maist fair, With tatling to divert his Care: For the good Woman sair he griev'd; He'ad needed nane if she had liv'd! Streight to a Bird man's Shop he hies, Who, stock'd with a' that wing the Skies, And give Delight with Feathers fair, Or please with a Melodious Air, Larks, Gowdspinks, Mavises and Linties, Baith hame bred, and frae foreign Countries; Of Parrats he had curious Choice, Carefully bred to make a Noise: The very warst had learn'd his Tale, To ask a Cup of Sack or Ale: Cry Westlin Herrings, or fresh Salmons, White Sand, or Norway Nuts like Almonds.— Delighted with their various Claver, While Wealth made all his Wits to waver, He cast his Look beneath the Board, Where stood ane that spake ne'er a Word: Pray, what art thou stands speechless there?— Reply'd the Bird,—I think the mair. The Buyer says, Thy Answer's wise, And thee I'll have at any Price.— What must you have?—Five Pounds.—'Tis thine The Money, and the Bird is mine.— Now in his Room this feather'd Sage Is hung up in a gilded Cage, The Master's Expectation's fully, Possest to hear him tauk like Tully: But a hale Month is past and gane, He never hears a Rhime but ane; Still in his Lugs he hears it rair, The less I speak, I think the mair. Confound ye for a silly Sot, What a dull Idiot have I got! As dull my sell, on short Acquaintance To judge of ane by a single Sentence. The Eclipse Upon his guilded Chariot led by Hours, With radiant Glories darting throw the Air, The Sun, high sprung in his Diurnal Course, Shed down a Day serenely sweet and fair. The Earth mair beautiful and fertile grew; The flowry Fields in rich Array, Smil'd lovely on the beamy Day, Delightful for the Eye to view; Ceres, with her golden Hair, Displaying Treasure ilka where, While useful Plenty made her Stalks to bow. A thousand little Suns glanc'd on the Wave; Nature appear'd to claim the Sun's Respect, All did sae blyth and beauteously behave.— Ah! cry'd the Moon, too much for him ye deck: My aking Een cannot this Glory bear. This Sun pretends nane in the Sky Can shine but him, then where am I? Soon I the contrary shall clear: By ae bauld Strake, With him I'll make, My equal Empire in the Heaven appear. 'Tis me that gives a Lustre to the Night; Then should not I my proper Right display, And now, even now dart down my Silver light? I give enough, this Sun gives too much Day. The Project fram'd,—Pale Cynthia now to shaw Her shining Power, right daftly run Directly 'tween the Earth and Sun. Unwise Design! the Warld then saw Instead of Light, the Moon Brought Darkness in at Noon, And without borrowing, had no Light at a'. Thus many empty and imprudent Men, Wha to their ain Infirmities are blind, Rax yont their Reach, and this Way let us ken A jealous, weak, and insufficient Mind. ANE EPISTLE to A. R. On the Poverty of the Poets Dear Allan, with your Leave, allow me, To ask you but one Question civil, Why thou'rt a Poet, pray thee, shew me, And not as poor as any Devil? I own your Verses make me gay; But as right Poet still I doubt ye, For we hear tell benorth the Tay, That nothing looks like want, about ye. In Answer then, attempt Sollution, Why Poverty torments your Gang? And by what Fortitude and Caution Thou guards thee from its meager Fang. Yours, &amp;c W. L. ANSWER [To the foregoing Epistle] SIR, That mony a thriftless Poet's poor, Is what they very well deserve, 'Cause aft their Muse turns common Whore, And flatters Fools that let them starve. Ne'er minding Business, they ly, Indulging Sloth, in Garret-Couches, And gape like Gorblins to the Sky With hungry Wames and empty Poutches. Dear Billies tak Advice for anes, If ye'd hope Honour by the Muse, Rather to Masons carry Stanes Than for your Patrons Block-heads chuse. For there's in Nature's secret Laws Of Sympath and Antipathy, Which is, and will be still the Cause Why Fools and Wits can ne'er agree. A wee Thing serves a chearfu' Mind, That is dispos'd to be contented; But he nae Happiness can find, That is with Pride and Sloth tormented. Still cautious to prevent a Dun, With Caps and Horns on Bills and Bands; The Sweets of Life I quietly cull, And answer Nature's small Demands. Lucky for me I never sang Fause Praises to a worthless Wight, And still took Pleasure in the Thrang Of them wha in good Sense delight. To such I owe what gave the Rise To ought thou in my Verse esteems, And Phoebe-like in darker Skies I but reflect their brighter Beams. To Mr ALLAN RAMSAY, upon his publishing his second Volume of POEMS [By William Somerville, Author of The Chase] Hail Caledonian Bard! whose rural Strains, Delight the list'ning Hills, and chear the Plains. Already polish'd by some Hand Divine, Thy purer Oar, what Furnace can refine? Careless of Censure, like the Sun shine forth, In Native Lustre, and intrinsick Worth. To Follow Nature is by Rules to write, She led the Way and taught the Stagirite: From her the Criticks Taste, the Poets fire, Both drudge in vain 'till she from Heav'n inspire. By the same Guide instructed how to soar, Allan is now what Homer was before. Ye chosen Youths wha dare like him aspire, And touch with bolder Hand the golden Lyre, Keep Nature still in view. On her Intent Climb by her Aid, the dang'rous steep Ascent, To lasting Fame. Perhaps a little Art Is needful to plane o'er some rugged Part, But the most labour'd Elegance and Care, T'arrive at full Perfection must despair, Alter, blot out, and write all o'er again, Alas! some venial Sins will yet remain. Indulgence is to Human Frailty due, Ev'n POPE has Faults, and ADDISON a few, But those, like Mists that cloud the Morning Ray Are lost, and vanish in the Blaze of Day. Tho' some intruding Pimple finds a Place Amid the Glories of Clarinda's Face, We still love on, with equal Zeal adore, Nor think her less a Goddess than before. Slight Wounds, in no disgraceful Scars shall end, Heal'd by the Balm of some good-natur'd Friend. In vain shall canker'd Zoilus assail, While Mr Spence, Poetry Professor in Oxford, and Fellow of New College. SPENCE presides, and Candor holds the Scale. His Gen'rous Breast, nor Envy sow'rs, nor Spite, Taught by William of Wicham, Founder of New College in Oxford, and of Winchester Coll. His motto is Manners maketh Man. his Founder's Motto how to write Good Manners guides his Pen. Learn'd without Pride; In dubious Points not forward to decide: If here and there uncommon Beauties rise, From Flow'r to Flow'r he roves with glad Surprize. In Failings no malignant Pleasure takes, Nor rudely triumphs over small Mistakes, No Nauseous Praise, no biting Taunts offend, W'expect a Censor, and we find a Friend. Poets improv'd by his correcting Care, Shall face their Foes with more undaunted Air, Strip'd of their Vid. Hom. Od. L. 24th. Rags shall like Ulysses shine, With more Heroick Port, and grace divine. No Pomp of Learning, and no Fund of Sense, Can e'er Attone for lost Benevolence. May WICHAM's Sons, who in each Art excel, And rival ancient Bards in Writing well, While from their bright Examples taught they sing, And emulate their Flights with bolder Wing, From their own Frailties learn the humbler Part, Mildly to judge in Gentleness of Heart. Such Criticks (Ramsay) jealous for our Fame, Will not with Malice insolently blame, But lur'd by Praise the hagard Muse reclaim. Retouch each Line, till all is just and neat, A whole of proper Parts, a Work almost compleat. So when some beauteous Dame, a Reigning Toast, The Flow'r of Forth, and proud Edina's Boast, Stands at her Toilet in her Tartan Plaid, And all her richest Head-gear, trimly clad, The curious Handmaid with observant Eye, Corrects the swelling Hoop that hangs awry, Thro' ev'ry Plait her busy Fingers rove, And now she plys below, and then above, With pleasing Tatle, entertains the Fair, Each Ribbon smooths, adjusts each rambling Hair, Till the gay Nymph in her full Lustre shine; And Vid. Hom. Il. L. 14. HOMER's JUNO was not half so fine. To William Somervile, of Warwick-shire Esq Again, like the Return of Day, From Avon's Banks, the chearing Lay Warms up a Muse was well nigh lost, In Depths of Snow and chilling Frost; But generous Praise the Soul inspires, More than rich Wines, and blazing Fires. Tho' on the Grampians I were chain'd, And all the Winter on me rain'd. Altho' half starv'd, my Sp'rit would spring Up to new Life to hear you sing. I take even Criticism kind, That sparkles from so clear a Mind. Friends ought and may point out a Spot, But Enemies make all a Blot. Friends sip the Honey from the Flower; All's Verjuice to the Waspish Sour. With more of Nature than of Art, From stated Rules I often start, Rules never studied yet by me. My Muse is British, bold and free, And loves at large to frisk and bound Unman'cled o'er Poetick Ground. I love the Garden wild and wide, Where Oaks have Plumb-Trees by their Side; Where Woodbines and the twisting Vine, Clip round the Pear-Tree and the Pine; Where mixt Jonckeels and Gowans grow, And Roses midst rank Clover blow, Upon a Bank of a clear Strand, Its Wimplings led by Nature's Hand; Tho' Docks and Bramble here and there, May sometimes cheat the Gardner's Care, Yet this to me's a Paradise, Compar'd with prime cut Plots and nice, Where Nature has to Art resign'd, Till all looks mean, stiff, and confin'd. May still my Notes of rustick Turn, Gain more of your Respect than Scorn, I'll hug my Fate, and tell sour Fools I'm more oblig'd to Heaven, than Schools. Heaven Homer taught.—The Critick draws Only from him, and such their Laws; The native Bards first plunge the Deep, Before the Artfull dare to leap. I've seen myself right many a Time, Copy'd in Diction, Mode and Rhime. Now, Sir, again let me express My Wishing Thoughts in fond Address, That for your Health, and Love you bear To two of my Chief Lord and Lady Somervile. Patrons here, You'd when the Lav'rocks rouze the Day, When Beams and Dews make blythsome May, When blooming Fragrance glads our Isle, And Hills with Purple Heather smile, Drop fancy'd Ails, with Courage stout, Ward off the Spleen, the Stone and Gout. May ne'er such Foes disturb your Nights, Or elbow out your Day Delights.— Here you will meet the jovial Train, Whose Clangors eccho o'er the Plain, While Hounds with Gowls both loud and clear, Well tun'd delight the Hunter's Ear, As they on Coursers fleet as Wind, Pursue the Fox, Hart, Hare or Hind. Delightful Game, where friendly Ties Are closer drawn, and Health the Prize. We long for, and we wish you here, Where Friends are kind, and Claret clear. The lovely Hope of Som'ril's Race, Who smiles with a Seraphick Grace; And the fair Sisters of the Boy Will have, and add much to your Joy. Give Warning to your noble Friend: Your humble Servant shall attend, A willing Sancho and your Slave, With the best Humour that I have, To meet you on that River's Shore, That Britons, now, divides no more. ALLAN RAMSAY. From The Echo, or Edinburgh Weekly Journal: 29th January, 1729 EPILOGUE Spoken After Acting The Orphan and The Gentle Shepherd in January 1729 PATIE speaks Life's but a Farce at best, and we To-day Have shewn you how the different Stations Play: Each Palace is a Stage,—each Cote the same, And Lords and Shepherds differ but in Name, In many Things—like Passions rule each Soul, And Love and Rage, and Grief and Joy, the whole: In these they tally, yet our Fables show, There's oft vast odds betwixt the High and Low: For artful Guile, Ambition, Hate and Pride, Gives least Disturbance to th'inferior Side. Monimia falls—while Peggy on the Plain, Enjoys her Wishes with her faithful Swain. Thus we can moralize—the End design'd, To firm our Look, and brighten up the Mind, To Please our Beauteous Audience, and improve Our Language, with the Energy to move— We'll sing the Rest.—Come Knight, and Partner Fair, Let's close our Entertainment with an Air. PATTIE sings [to the Tune of Bessie Bell] Thus let us study Night and Day, to fit us for our Station, That, when we're Men, we Parts may Play are useful to our Nation; For now's the Time, while we are Young, to fix our Views on Merit, Water its Buds, and make the Tongue and Action sute the Spirit. PEGGY This all the Fair and Wise approve, we know it by your Smiling, And while we gain Respect and Love, our Studies are not toiling. Such Application gives Delight, and in the End proves gainful, What many a dark and lifeless Wight thinks Labour hard and Painful. Sir WILLIAM Then never let us think our Time and Care, when thus imployed, Are thrown away; but deem't a Crime when Youth's by Sloth destroyed. 'Tis only active Souls can rise to Fame, and all that's splendid. Still Favourites of these conquering Eyes, 'gainst whom no Heart's defended. From The Scarborough Miscellany: 1732. Verses by the celebrated ALLAN RAMSAY, to his Son. On his drawing a fine Gentleman's Picture. Young Painter, thy Attempt is fair, And may'st thou finish with a Grace, The happy Smile unmix'd with Care, That ever shines in ? Face. So far thy Labour, well design'd, May all thy outward Form display, But Pencils cannot paint the Mind, In this, to me, thou must give way. With glowing Colours thou canst show, Th'embroider'd Coat and nice Tupee: Draw him a first Rate blazing Beau, Easy and airy, gay and free. But I can place him in a Light, That will his higher Merits hit; Display, what makes him much more bright, His Courage, Learning, and his Wit. His sprightly Humour, solid Sense, And—but here further 'tis not meet, I should his noted Worth advance, Lest I be deem'd a Parasite. Yet this let little Wou'd-be's know, Who are but Apes of so much Fire; 'Tis the Philosopher, not Beau, Who we deservedly admire. Trifle, why not? with Cloaths and Air, Sing, dance, and joke, whene'er ye please, These oft our Joy and Health repair, Acceptable, perform'd with Ease. True Art and Nature must combine, To combat human Cares so rife; And rarely Characters can shine So fair, as ? in Life. ADDRESS of Thanks from the Society of Rakes. [1735]The full title is: An / Address of Thanks / From The / Society of Rakes, / To the pious Author of / An Essay upon improving and adding to / the Strength of Great Britain and Ire / land by Fornication. To which is added, / An Epistle to the said Author, by a / nother Hand. We Noblemen, Barons and Burgesses of the foresaid Class, to the Reverend Philosark, Greeting. Thanks and Renown be ever thine, O daring sensible DIVINE, Who in a few learn'd Pages, Like great Columbus, now discovers A pleasing Warld to a' young Lovers, Unkend to by-past Ages. Down, down with your Repenting-Stools, That gart the Younkers look like Fools Before the Congregation; Since thou, learn'd Youth, of rising Fame, Proves that there's neither Sin nor Shame In simple FORNICATION. Now Lads laugh a', and take your Wills, And scowp around like Tups and Bulls, Have at the bony Lasses: For Conscience has nae mair to say, Our Clergy-man has clear'd the Way, And proven our Fathers Asses. Our Donard Dads, snool'd with their Wives, To girn and scart out wretched Lives Till Death, bound to a fixt ane. But now as free as Cocks and Sparrows, We lawfully may shift our Marrows, And wheel round to the next ane. Thus any mettled Man may have, Between his Cradle and his Grave, By lawfu' Fornication, Bairns mony mae, with far less Din, Thus free, and be mair usefu' in His Day and Generation. Thus we may PATRIOTISM shaw, And serve our Country ane and a', By fruitfu' Propagation: Thus will we bravely Man our Fleet, Thus make our Regiments a' complete, And clear frae Debts the Nation. Hence shall we never mair hear tell Of Lasses leading Apes in Hell, Like them wha aften harl'd Ane useless Life up to Fourscore, Leal Maids, and scarcely kend wherefore They were sent to the Warld. The Mimmest now, without a Blush, May speer, if any Billy sprush Has Fancy for her Beauty: For since the Awband's tane away, The bony Lass has nought to say Against a moral Duty. ADULTERY is the warst of Crimes, And calls for Vengeance on these Times, As practis'd in this Nation: But that vile Sin can be no more, When Marriage is turn'd out of Door, By franker Fornication. Peace be to you in Daughters rife, Since nane needs now to be a Wife; Their Tochers winna fash ye: That universal ane of Crammond, That gaes alang with a good Gammond, Will set aff ilka Lassie. Yet some by your New Light will lose; For those wha Kirk-Affairs engross, Their Session-Books may burn all. Since Fornication's Pipe's put out, What will they have to crack about, Or jot into their Journal? Even fell K.T. that gart us ban, And eke, that setting Dog, his Man, May turn Italian Singers; Or use a teugh St. Johnston Ribbon; For now the Gain they were sae glib on, Is slipt out of their Fingers. Nae mair at early Hours, and late, Shall they round Bawdy-houses wait, Like Cats for stragling Mice; Departed is that Fund of Fending, When Fornicators, for offending, They gart pay ony Price. Rejoice, ye Lads of little Rent, Who loo'd the Game, but did lament, Your Purses being skranky, The Dearth of Phorny's now away, Since lawfu', ye have nought to pay, But welcome, and we thank ye. Poor Fornicators, now grown auld, Whase Blood begins to creep but cauld, Will grumble with Reflection, To think what Fashry they gade throw, Dear DOCTOR, wanting ane like you, To give them right Direction. What say ye for your sells, ye Priests, For naming kind Whoremasters Beasts, When using of their Freedom? We hope ye'll cease to take Offence At worthy Wives, like Lucky Spence, Or usefu' Mother Needham. Look up, ye Matrons, if ye can, And bless the Reverend pious Man, Who proves that your procuring, Is now sae far frae being a Crime, That Devotees, when past their Prime, May lend a Hand to Whoring. The Fair ane, frighted for her Fame, Shall, for her Kindness, bear nae Blame, Or with Kirk-censure grapple; Whilk gart some aft, their leev alane, Bring to the Warld the luckless Wean, And sneg its Infant Thrapple. For which, by rude unhallow'd Fallows, They were surrounded to the Gallows, Making sad reufu' Murgeons, “'Till their warm Pulse forgot to play: They sang, they swang, and sank away, Syne were gi'en to the Surgeons.” O Leader, see that ye be sure That 'tis nae Sin to play the Whore; For some in haly Station, The contrair threep, and sair abuse ye: But we'll aft drink your Health and ruse ye, For rusing Fornication. We might forsee, the canker'd Clergy Wad with vile Hetrodoxy charge ye, And cast ye out frae 'mang them: But that has been the common Fate Of a' Reformers, wha' debate, Or struggle to o'ergang them. But letna their ill-word disturb ye; 'Tis but a Blast, they canna curb ye, Or cramp your new Devotions. A Briton free thinks as he likes, And, as his Fancy takes the Fykes, May preach or print his Notions. Be satisfied, your Doctrine new Will favour find with not a few, It being sae inviting. And tho' they kick ye frae their Kirk, For that sma' Skaith ye need not irk, We'll make ye a bra Meeting. O had we fifty vacant Kirks, By Pith, or Slight, or ony Quirks, And we erected Patrons! Then shou'd you see the Patron Act Demolish a' the Marrow Pack, And Sessions rul'd by Matrons. The fattest Stipend shou'd be thine, Thou pious and maist pure Divine, Thy Right is back'd with Reason: For wha can doubt your Care of Sauls, Wha loudly for mae Bodies calls, In this degenerate Season. But nine and forty Pulpits still Wou'd then remain, for you to fill, Wi' Men of mighty Gifts. Then, Students, there were Hopes for you, Wha're of the learn'd Free-thinking Crew, And now are at your Shifts. Your Essay shaws your Eloquence, Your courtly Stile and Flow of Sense; And though some say ye blunder, Ye do them sae with Scripture pelt, They will be forc'd to thumb your Belt At last, and a' knock under. Your Scheme must take; for, let me tell ye, 'Tis a good Trade that fills the Belly, The Proverb proves it plainly: And to say Goodness is not good, Wad shaw a Mind extremely rude, To argue sae profanely. Thou well deservest high Promotion, Wha'st wrote with sic a lively Motion Upon Multiplication, T'enrich a Kingdom, better far Than that curst Business of War, That ushers Desolation. Doctor, farewell, O never stint, For Love's sweet Sake to preach and print, Tho' some with Bedlam shore ye; Do not sma' Punishment regard, Since Virtue has its ain Reward, In Persecution glory. EPISTLE to the Reverend Philosarchus Minister of the Kirk of Scotland, occasioned by his late Essay, proving the Lawfulness of FORNICATION. Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri, Irrita perpetua solvent formidine terras. Virg. How much, O Pastor, do we owe Thy Pains and Piety, Which covers thus our numerous Crimes, And our Iniquity! What Honours wait to crown thy Brow And make thy Heart right glad! Bastards unborn shall lisp thy Praise, And Foundlings call thee Dad. Thou like another Saturn bringst The Golden Age again; Sinners no more shall curse the Land, Where 'tis no sin to sin. O had I OVID'S wondrous Quill Such Change to represent; When every Saint shall Sinner turn, And every Sinner Saint. Then shall no paultry pocky House In Closs or Cowgate be: In Turnpike Foot none shall make Love, But all shall flock to thee. Thy Pulpit-Desk, Repenting-stool, Each Gallery, Pew and Seat, Shall all promote the glorious End, And serve to prop the State. The Treasurer of the Kirk, who now Behaves himself but queerish, Shall join his Man with one Accord, And pimp it for the Parish. Nor shall the Minister, good Man, His Stipend lose or Kirk, Let it be his to say the Grace, And oversee the Work. When this thou seest, then thou shalt see, My Friend, what thou shalt see; Powder'd Toupees shall grace the Kirk, And Lords religious be. None shall be to thy Church compell'd, They'll come without obliging; Papists and Jews shall change their Minds, And be of our Religion. Ye Bedrals eke, O hungry Wights, Your Grumbling shall give o'er; Silver and Gold your Palms shall grease, Where Copper serv'd before. O let not these, most pious Priest, Alone imploy thy Care; Sinners in Crowds of highest Rank Aloud demand a Share. Find out that Brib'ry is no Sin, Statesmen will thank thee for't: Make Lying and Deceit divine, Thoul't get a Place at Court. Find out Injustice to be just, The Judges will commend: Prove killing Men a gracious Deed, The Doctors are your Friend. Thus shall the People of this Land Be from their Terrors freed; And every one shall bless the Day That thou hast learn'd to read. From The Caledonian Mercury, August 2, 1736 LEITH RACES “Saturday last the City Plate was won by a Horse of Sir James Cuningham of Milncraig's, against two English Horses, one of which was distanced at the very first Heat. On which Occasion we received the following Piece of Poetry.” His majesty, Heaven guide His Grace, Encourages each Year a Race Upon Leith-sands; where, at Laigh Tide, A Million may uncrowded ride: And the Good Town, to mend the Play, Maintains the Sport another Day. The sprightly Lads from far and near In their best Airs and Looks appear, Dress'd in their easy Hunting Weeds, Well mounted on their mettled Steeds; While from the Chariot, or the Green, A shining Circle charms our Een, Whose ev'ry Glance emits a Dart Whops whizzing thro' the stoutest Heart. Ye Men of Rowth, ne'er hain your Treasure, For any thing may give Them Pleasure, And since they like to show their Faces At Plays, Assemblies, and Horse-Races, Support these Interviews of Love, Which Men of clearest Heads approve, Rather than waste your Wealth at Cards Or blast your Health with drunken Lairds. Ah, ne'er let manly Pastime dwine, For sake of either Dice or Wine; But keep a Groom can rightly nurse The shapely Racer for the Course, That, barring some unseen Mischance, The Master's Honour may advance, While loud o'er the extended Sands The Crowd rejoice and clap their Hands. Should we endure the taunting Tales Of Hunters on Northumber's dales, While o'er their Tankards of brown Stout, They at our careless gentry flout— “Come, Dick! says Harry, mount your Gray, “I'll bett against you on my Bay: “Let's down to Leith—we're sure to win, “Where there's no better Nags to run. “Of two rich Plates their Gazette tells, “For which they keep no Horse themsells. “Since we so cheap may gain each Cup, “We'll e'en step down and bring them up.” Well, this had been just now our Case, Had not Sir James join'd in the Race, Whose Bonny Lass of Livingston, Defeat Cutlugs and Judy Brown. Thanks to the Knight who props our Game. O! may his Coursers ne'er prove lame, But ever 'gainst the Day design'd Be able to outfly the Wind And every Year bring him a Prize 'Till Heaps on Heaps the Trophies rise. A.R. From The Caledonian Mercury, November 8, 1736 PROLOGUE for the Opening of the New Theatre in Carrubber's Close, 8 Nov., 1736 “On Monday last the new Theatre in Carrubber's Close was opened (which is thought by all Judges to be as complete, and finished with as good a Taste as any one of its Size in the three Kingdoms) when the following Prologue was spoken by Mr Bridges.” Long has it been the Bus'ness of the Stage To mend our Manners, and reform the Age. This Task the Muse by Nature was assign'd, E're Christian Light shone in upon the Mind; Ev'n since those glorious Truths to Men appear'd, Her moral Precepts still have been rever'd, And where the sacred Monitors have fail'd, Just Satyre from the Stage hath oft prevail'd. Tho' some sour Criticks full of Phlegm and Spleen, Condemn her Use as hellish and obscene; And from their gloomy thoughts and want of Sense, Think what diverts the Mind gives Heav'n Offence. Would such from Truth and Reason form their Sample, They'll find what's meant for Precept, what Example, Nor think when Vice and Folly shall appear, The Characters were drawn for them to wear. Fools in their native Follies should be shown, and Vice must have its Language to be known. To such this Lesson then we recommend, Let each mend one, the Stage will have its End, Good Sense shall flourish, Reason triumphant reign, And Hypocrites no more their Power Maintain; The Muse shall once again resume her Throne, And our Stage vie with Athens or with Rome. Long in those Realms she held her rapid Flight, Filling their Minds with Profit and Delight. Till in despight of Sense, and wits Disgrace, Dull Ignorance a while usurp'd her Place, For many ages bore the Palm alone, And wild Buffoons defil'd her sacred Throne. But late at length she reach'd Britannia's Shore, And Shakespear taught her once again to soar. At last transplanted by your tender Care She hopes to keep her Seat of Empire here. To your Protection then ye Fair and Great, This Fabrick to her Use we consecrate. On you it will depend to raise her Name, And in Edina fix her lasting Fame. To the Honourable DUNCAN FORBES of Culloden, Lord President of the SESSION, AND All our other Good JUDGES, who are careful of the Honour of the Government, and the Property of the Subject; The Address of Allan Ramsay, Humbly means and shaws, To You, My LORDS, whase Elevation Makes You the Wardens of the Nation, While You by equal Justice stand, With Lawtie's Ballance in Your Hand; To You, whase penetrating Skill Can eithly redd the Good frae Ill, And ken them well whase fair Behaviour Deserve Reward and Royal Favour, As like you do, these stonkerd Fellows Wha merit naithing but the Gallows: To You, with humble Bow, Your Bard, Whase greatest Brag is Your Regard, Begs leave to lay his Case before Ye, And for an Outgate to implore Ye. Last Year, My Lords, nae farrer gane, A costly Wark was undertane By me, wha had not the least Dread An Act wad knock it on the Head: A Play-house new, at vast Expence, To be a large, yet bein Defence, In Winter-nights, 'gainst Wind and Weet, To ward frae Cauld the Lasses sweet; While they with bonny Smiles attended, To have their little Failures mended; Where Satire, striving still to free them, Hads out his Glass, to let them see them. Here, under Rules of right Decorum, By placing Consequence before 'em, I kept our Troop, by Pith of Reason, Frae Bawdy, Atheism, and Treason; And only preach'd, frae Moral Fable, The best Instruction they were able; While they, by Doctrine Linsy Woolsy, Set aff the Utile with Dulce. And shall the Man, to whom this Task falls, Suffer amang confounded Rascals; That, like vile Adders, dart their Stings, And fear nae God, nor honour Kings? Shall I, wha for a Tract of Years Have sung to Commons and to Peers, And got the general Approbation Of all within the British Nation, At last be twin'd of all my Hopes By them that wont to be my Props? Be made a Loser, and engage With Troubles in declining Age; While Wights, to whom my Credit stands For Sums, make sour and thrawin Demands? Shall London have its Houses twa, And we be doom'd to've nane ava? Is our Metrop'lis, anes the Place Where langsine dwelt the Royal Race Of Fergus, this gate dwindled down T'a Level with ilk Claghan Town, While thus she suffers the Subversion Of her maist rational Diversion? When Ice and Snaw o'ercleads the Isle, Wha now will think it worth their while, To leave their gowsty Country Bowers, For, the anes blythsome, Edinburgh's Towers, Where there's nae Glee to give Delight, And ward frae Spleen the langsome Night? For which they'll now have nae Relief, But sonk at hame, and cleck Mischief. Is there aught better than the Stage, To mend the Follies of the Age, If manag'd as it ought to be, Frae ilka Vice and Blaidry free? Which may be done, with perfect Ease, And nought be heard that shall displease, Or give the least Offence or Pain, If we can hae't restor'd again. Wherefore, My Lords, I humbly pray Our Lads may be allow'd to play, At least till New-house Debts be paid off, The Clause that I'm the maist afraid of; Which Laid lyes on my single Back, And I maun pay it ilka Plack. Now, it's but just the Legislature Shou'd either say that I'm a Fauter, Or thole me to employ my Bigging, Or of the Burthen ease my Rigging, By ord'ring, frae the publick Fund, A Sum to pay for what I'm bound; Syne, for a mends for what I've lost, Edge me into some canny Post, With the good Liking of our King, And your Petitioner shall—sing. Edinburgh, July 25. 1737. From The Scots Magazine, October, 1741 AN EPISTLE To James Oswald Dear Oswald, could my verse as sweetly flow, As notes thou softly touchest with the bow, While all the circling fair attentive hing, On ilk vibration of thy trembling string, I'd sing how thou wouldst melt our sauls away By solemn notes, or chear us wi' the gay, In verse as lasting as thy tunes shall be, As soft as thy new polish'd Danton me. But wha can sing that feels wi' sae great pain The loss for which Edina sighs in vain? Our concert now nae mair the Ladies mind; They've a' forgot the gait to Niddery's wynd. Nae mair the Braes of Ballandine can charm, Nae mair can Fortha's Bank our bosoms warm, Nae mair the Northern Lass attention draw, Nor Pinky-house gi' place to Alloa. O JAMIE! when may we expect again To hear from thee, the soft the melting strain, And, what's the loveliest, think it hard to guess, Miss St?t, or thy Lass of Inverness? When shall we sigh at thy soft Cypress-grove, So well adapted to the tale of love? When wilt thou teach our soft Æidian fair, To languish at a false Sicilian air; Or when some tender tune compose again, And cheat the town wi' David Rizo's name? Alas! no more shall thy gay tunes delight, No more thy notes sadness or joy excite, No more thy solemn bass's awful sound, Shall from the chapel's vaulted roof rebound. London, alas! which aye has been our bane, To which our very loss is certain gain, Where our daft Lords and Lairds spend a' their rents, In following ilka fashion she invents, Which laws we like not aft on us entails, And where we're forc'd to bring our last appeals, Still envious of the little we had left, Of JAMIE OSWALD last our town bereft. 'Tis hard indeed—but may you now repent The day that to that spacious town you went. If they thy value know as well as we, Perhaps our vanish'd gold may flow to thee. If so, be wise; and when ye're well to fend, Return again and here your siller spend. Mean while, to keep our heavy hearts aboon, O publish a' your works, and send them soon: We'll a' subscribe, as we did for the past, And play while bows may wag or strings can last. Farewell—perhaps, if you oblige us soon, I'll sing again to a new fav'rite tune. PART II. Poems in manuscript or posthumously published. (1) Poems for which dates can be assigned. To the Most Happy Members of the Easy Club, 1712 Were I but a prince or King, I'de advance ye, I'de advance ye; Were I but a prince or King, So highly's I'de advance ye. Great Sence and Wit are ever found 'Mong you always for to abound, Much like the Orbs that still move round, No way's constrain'd, but Easy. Were I, &amp;c. Most of what's hid from Vulgar eye, Even from earth's center to the sky, Your Brighter thoughts do clearly spy, Which makes you wise and Easy. Were I, &amp;c. Appollo's Self unknown attends, And in good humour re-ascends The forkt Parnassus, and Commends You for being blyth and easy. Were I, &amp;c. All faction in the Church or State, With greater wisdom still you hate, And leave learn'd fools these to Debate; Like Rocks in Seas ye're easy. Were I, &amp;c. May all you do Successfull prove, And may you never fall in love With what's not firm for your behoof, Or may make you uneasy. Were I, &amp;c. I love ye well—O! let me be One of your Blyth Society, And, like your Selves, I'll strive to be Ay humorous and Easy. Were I, &amp;c. On Andrew Brown Hanging Himself [c. 1713] Now what could be the carl's drift to which auld Nick lent him a lift Unless it were a wylie shift To hain his bread Now he'll eat nane and that is thrift Since he is dead How coud the fallow be sa daft to tye himsell up to the laft I at's awn bed fit, where he sa aft . . . By heaven's it was cursedly uncivil In a bout to prove his fathers Rivall And then in Rage without Reprivall his sire to send with Cords down headlong to the devill Oh fatall end here be thou seiz'd with plague and pox Even hell account thee heterodox Just heaven inflict most grievous stro(kes) Till thou perpends thy sire below needs make no clocks Where time nere ends Cauld be your cast who curst your dad May fleas ay bite you i' your bed be drawn when hanged in a sled to gallow lee After curst sauls to pluto fled there ay hing ye. In a Clock cord baith tough and snell Some others think he hangd himsell Which was a nearer cut to hell and with mare speed, Where base ? (The fragment ends here) A Rebuke to Antony Uneasy [1713] Uneasy's a thief; 'tis black burning shame. I'le flite his muse deaf, and blunder his name. His muse, said I? Hang it! It must be damn'd lame— She pilfer'd from Bion, the great son of fame. Confess then ye'r dull and greatly to blame To fancy our club so silly and tame To be tricked by Ma(d)ge in the weeds of her dame. From my forge at Parnasus, the 18th of the 8 moon, the year of our club 2. Take this, Sir, from your most proud and arogant Deacon, Gawain Douglas. THE LAMENTATION 9 Nov. 1715 George Why drooping thus? Say, Gawin, what is the cause That surly face dares break our Easy laws. Gawin These drumbly times do very much confound My easy thinking and my judgement wound, While grief and hope alternately go round. George Let wild confusions do the worst they can, No accident shall crush the vertuous man; Should jarring discord make all nature crack And wasting wars make of this world a wrack, No casual event can his peace controul, He stands secure, fix'd on his lofty soul. Gawin Ah George, methinks it stupid not to moan— Should we not sigh to hear our Mother groan Now when her sides are tore with civil broils And her brave blood in dreadful madness boils? Her hardy sons, whose fame was heard afar, Now 'gainst each other threaten cruel war. They who spread terrour in the dusky plain And, panting, trod o're mountains of the slain, Who knew to dye much better than to yield And still were slain, or victors kept the field— Now must this daring courage all be spent In quelling private feuds and discontent? Degenerate age, say what can be the cause To prompt such wrath as shocks all nature's laws. 'Gainst brother brother, father 'gainst the son, Both seem resolv'd their party's risque to run, To gain their end no danger seem to shun. The kind emotions of a tender wife Who, fainting, views her husband in the strife, Dismay'd, she fears his slender tack of life. But now nor wife nor infant charms can make His strong resolves or inclinations shake Tho both his life and fortune's at the stake. He mounts his steed, nor her advice does ask But sets his all upon the dreadful cast. She's left alone and doubts of his return; She loves the man and can not chuse but mourn, Thus tryes to waste her grief by shedding tears And by faint hopes to crush substantial fears. Pacific hinds whose humble minds regard No politicks beyond their barn and yard Are forced to arms. These tools of death they weild with awkward hand, While ploughs on until'd ridg[e]s neglected stand. They see destruction through the kingdom reel And meagre famine treading on its heel When frugal arts of peace are laid aside To gratifie a dull schismatick pride. These sure are ills, yet there are ten times more Which every thinking Scotsmen should deplore. George They are, indeed. Yet often when disease Does threaten death to give the patient ease, From purple veins the lancet gives a pass To that base blood which would defile the mass. So may it hit. I know the horrid cause for which we smart, The black idea's rivet in my heart. O may they only suffer by the rod Who with this cursed crime offended God. Gawin So may it end as I would wish, and then I'll change my airs and tune my reed again. Both Till then heav'd blast our foes and save true hearted men. To the Right Honourable George, Lord Ramsay Edinburgh, Janr 1st 1719 To you my lord, my earlyest lays belong, a Ramsay's Chief demands a Ramsay's song, deemst not presumtion nor with scorn refuse the humble Tribute of an honest muse. In virteous days long 'ere the Romish priest By Avarice made goodness seem a jest, e're Clergy discord from Men's Bosoms drove Nat'rule Simplicity, Social love, The Bards of old the Heroes did inspire with noble sentiments and Gen'rous fire, sweet &amp; sublime their happy numbers flow'd and all arround a generall good Bestow'd. The Brave and Great with Justice pant for fame But often wander wide and miss their aim, oft' best of Men their best Designs are Crost, by want of Skill in Errour's Mazes lost, But he who Studys Men and Books aright Views Causes and Effects in their trew light, when polite knowledge Litrature Refines that patriot with uncommon luster shines. Thus you, My Lord (fame sayst,—&amp; fame says Truth) Restore your usefull Time, and vig'rous Youth. Well may you prosper in each Bright Desire Still taking for your patern your Brave Sire posest of all his prudence &amp; his fire. The thinking Man eyes his Ancestor's worth preservs the Grandure of his house and Birth and through the Golden Mien he wisely steers Not cheated with vain Hopes nor Crush'd with fears. By fortitude of mind he conquest gains O're sordid pleasures and imagind pains superior to the puny pleagues of Life looks down on trifles which engender strife. such a great Soul can destiny command who holds his passions with a steady hand Great in himself, he all his actions Rules by virtue, and leavs pegeantry to fools he scorns to cringe at courts or Blur his mind with consent, when his countrey's fall's designd But when plac'd at the Helm of state affairs the publick good engroses all his Cares How litle Fuscus looks how mean &amp; vile at him the sullen rail and jovial smile an Empty Buble with a Vast Estate design'd a slave, but by mistaken fate thrown on a family to its disgrace staining the honour'd glorys of his Race without a thought from stew to stew he scours and nothing minds but drunkeness and whoors Now these fair ridges which his fathers won wastes like the snow before the summer's sun, thus he goes on, destroying life &amp; health and hangs a dead weight on the Commonwealth, But soon of him the nation shall have ease, a young old man all Rotten with desease! I show this Monster just to make yow Laugh Your inate vertues shall preserve yow safe, for greater uses by indulgent Heav'n your Sprightly Soul, and nervous limbs wer giv'n, Thousands we hope from your brave loyns shall spring to serve their God, their Countrey, &amp; their King. O may that fair! whose circling arms shal twine your manly Breast, in all that's Charming Shine, May she be sent on purpose from above be worthy yow and Worthy of your Love: In this Important Choise My Lord be nice, and take your Motions by our Chief's advice, Experience crowns his wisdom, and he knows the springs from which this or that Event flows. That He whose nod the Universe Obeys May give yow lengthned lease of Joyfull Days My Lord Your Lordship's most humble and devouted servant Allan Ramsay. THE HAPPY MAN How happy's he who rais'd above low care by plenteous fortune, with ane equall mind, Enjoys what Heaven has given him for his share with Conduct, and a Spirit unconfin'd. Whose active Soul delights in the pursuit of knowledge, where true honour's only form'd, That use of life which Yeilds the fairest fruit and gives a fame Detraction cannot wound. Who has a Partner of a cast divine all Prudence, Goodness and of Humour Sweet, Whose Virtues throw Her lovely features shine and amiably in her Actions meet, Forbiding Spleen and all domestick Strife groundless mistake the Spring of all debate, The best of Husbands he—she the best Wife, brings human life near to the Heavenly state. But who can paint the Addition of his Joys when in their dawn he his own worth can trace, In the rich Budings of his Lovely Boys and all their Mother in each Daughter's Grace, Whose Beautyous Smiles engage Paternal Love to Cultivate the hopefull Early Bloom In minds he can so easylie improve that have for every virtue Spacious Room. Happy the man thus Blest twice happy he! that is and views his Bliss in proper light, with gratefull Soul from Spleen &amp; Envy free, takes in these gifts divine or just delight. Knows where to fix th'extent of his desire nor slights the real for imagin'd good Nor suffers vice t'inflame with wasting fire nor is with all these excellencys proud. But where, say you, shall we in this vile Age the Originall of these outlines remark My friend attend then, And I shall engage to Show them all and more in S(i)r John Clerk.

JULY 10th, 1721. Night now had spread her Gloom o'er all the Skies, And Sleep had seal'd up every Guardian's Eyes; When o'er the darken'd plain kind Urban stray'd; With careful pace, to meet his faithful Maid, But there's no wandring where true Love's the Guide, Soon in his Arms he found his lovely Bride. Ee'r yet the Morn had rais'd her rosy Head, To cross the Waves the swelling Sails are spread, Pleas'd Ocean smooth'd his Brow, the Winds blew fair, And seemed to whisper doun each lesser Care; When to his Bella Urban did impart, In softest words th'emotions of his Heart. My dearest charge (said he) drop every Care, Let these be mine—they're now fall'n to my share, Them I can bear—so Heav'n has well design'd, Our Fortitude to shield your softer Mind, Now you are mine so fate consents and You, And to the join't consent each one must Bow; Ev'n He who claims your Duty and your Love, Since he is Wise, there's hopes he will approve, Him gain'd we'll slight each medd'ling little Mind, That to the Strength of Sympathy are blind; Who think join't hands make Nuptial rites compleat While Inclinations never chance to meet; Then let no doubts of what the World may say, Raise the least Cloud on our fair Marriage Day. A Blushing Glance here serv'd for a reply, And Urban read what pleas'd him in her Eye, Which rais'd his Raptures, and forbade each pain, That frights poor fools from Hymen's happy Chain; The Chain which now with glad consent they bear, And mutual Love shall make them easy wear. No sooner had loud Fame with spreading Blast, Giv'n out the News when each their verdict past, At sullen Coffee—at the sparkling Wine, Or the lov'd Circle where the Fair combine To sip their Tea—I got this fair account Which justly balanc'd, here is the amount; Some envy'd—some their weaker Souls betray'd, Believing what each low detracter said; Such have nor Sense, nor Courage to Assert, (Like Urban's self,) the Cause of wrong'd desert. But these who dare to own their thoughts aloud And wisely sep'rate from the thoughtless Croud, Approv'd the Choice of both, since only Love, Calls doun the Marriage Blessings from above, Which to Old age may they enjoy profuse, Is the kind wishes of an honest Muse.

Vol. II, p. 146.] who with a schollars help, and rung had driven a monk out of his door wha'd gart his Bessy play the whore, Some week therafter, when the light grew mikle shorter than the Night, and Corns were ruck'd up in the yard, and nought but thumping flails were heard, about this Time, their meal to tent young maidens to the Mills were sent, to Haby's Mill came bonny Jean with rosie cheeks and jet-black een, round were her haunches, jimp her waste, tho but in Bodice she was laced, The younkers gabs she made them watter and uncko fain they wad been at her, yet cannylie she shun'd their dandling and kept her Jewel frae their handling, Hab coost her mony a loving glower and in his heart did wish to stow her, lang in his breast he hid his smart sighing frae legens of his Heart, but by degrees he grew some baulder and all his kindest thoughts he tauld her, while the dear lass point-blank refused him, and for his impudence missused him, bad him gae hame to his ain Gawsie, titter than tempt a simple Lassie, Hab heard her as if heard her not, pressing still forward with his plot, where'er he met her late, or air, whilk fash'd the young-thing very sair, thus plagued, at last she tauld to Bess his wife, the story mair and less. I'm very blith, replyd the wife to hear Hab has sae mikle life, Let's nick him, in this merry mood; 'tis an ill wind blaws nane some good, now my dear Bairn since ye're sae just with this affair my sell to trust, to cheat him, wee'll sae club our skill, that hee'll ne'er tempt you at his mill, the day's now short, and 'tis not right to travell under cloud of night, gae back and see your corn ground out, and if my cowsie still prove stout, and for a Grant be briskly bent seem by degrees to give consent, say that for anes, you'll be complyan and tell the bed you are to ly in, on hand we have sae mikle corn, that he and Jock maun grind till morn, sae when he thinks we're sound asleep right sleely to your Bed he'll creep, where I design to take my due, by catching what he means for you, while in my Bed, you may sleep soun, and rise as leal as ye lay doun, Thus the good-wife and pawky Jean contriv'd to hoodwink Haby's een, Streight to the mill the maiden went, and after tigging, smild consent, then rounded in his lug he might come after midle of the night, in stealing quiet as ony wreath: and no to speak aboon his breath, then all the favours that he wanted should to his ain desire be granted, Hab heard, well pleasd, the dear decoy and worried oer the bait with Joy, he clappd her round the neck sae sleek and slaverd her frae cheek to cheek, Jumpt in with all that she desire'd to sic a bleez his saul was fire'd, Now here, to make a lang Tale short that we may hasten to the sport, imagine that the Night's far fled, they have sup'd and all gane to their Bed, but happy Hab, and Jock his man, wha maun attend the Mill till dawn, the Noon of Night a while was gane and a' was still as ony stane, The moon was wysing to the west, the Birds sat noding in the nest, ther was nae noise, but mill-trows roaring, and the hard labourd Threshers snoring, when Hab, as pawky as a Theif, staw sleelie to his loving Reif, hooly and fairly did he tred till he fand out the Lass's Bed, Syne without either din or strife e'en crap down quietly by his wife, with dunting heart, kedgie and keen, still thinking she was bonny Jean, here let them kiss and court their fill, for man and wife they'll do nae ill, we draw the courtain here, tis best to let you fancy out the rest, Soon as wild passions get their vent Reason returns, and we repent, a crime commited, sinners feel, conviction treding on its heel, So fared it now with glunshan Hab, wha hang his lugs, and threw his gab, when he began to think if Jean might, very likely, fa with wean 'twad, with the gracie, sink his credit, soon as they came to ken wha did it, then I, thought he, like an auld fool maun for Adultry mount the Stool, and for a year, stand like a Sentrie in a sack-brab by the Kirk-entrie, syne, warst of a', the girning strife and curst reflections of my wife, whilk ne'er will stint, till kindly death, may prove my friend and stap her breath. As thus his mind was driven with dread, a lucky whim came in his Head, Could I, thought he, perswade our Jock, wha is young and crowse as ony cock, to be gliff with Jeany kind, 'twad lift this burden aff my mind, Sure, of the proffer he'll be fain, the Deil's ay bussy with his ain. Come hither, Jonny Lad, quoth hee tell me young hash, what wad ye gie, for a kind bout with Jeany Gream, wha's lying in our house at hame, with arms arround her head uplifted, as saft and white as flour well sifted, inviting to the tender tooly, with breath like the pease bloom in July, At this Jock's heart gade pitty-pattan eegd on by flush of youth, and Satan, he fidg'd and clew his heathery pow, while his round cheeks began to glow, Master, said he, my words ar few I have nought els but a fat sow She shall be yours by morning light, if you help me to Jean this night, the Bargin's haden, said the miller, She's yours, and I'll direct you till her, there, take this Key of the fore door, slyd quiet and saftly oer the floor, till ye come to the side-wa gantry, that stands between the Ha and pantry, there in the bed, that steeks with doors the lovely lambie sweetly snores, I leave the rest to your ain skill to bring the lassie to your will, She'll not be thraff, if ye be tenty, to take the measures that are genty, I gie ye leave your time to tak, Now swith, and let me see your back, Jock snoov'd away like ony thing as streight as if led with a string, to where the Good-wife took repose, after the foresaid loving dose, the lad himsell did canny guide, and crap doun quietly by her side, he thought her Jean,—she thought him Hab, Syn very kindly, gab to gab, they past their time till near day-breaking at the auld trade of basket-making, now having got his heart's desire, Jock of the Sport began to tire Startled for fear of a discovering, Slade cleverly frae neath the covering and staw out quiet, as quiet as coud be, without e'er saying, Lord be w'ye, the ungracious brush of foly oer, Jock's wakened conscience 'gan to glower, striking his heart strings to the quick, with mony a grivious cuff, and kick, ca'd him a wicked dog, to grein by sic a trick to herrie Jean, of what is ilka Maiden's pride when she gangs to the Kirk a Bride, but what he maist of a' did rew was the daft tinsell of his Sow, whilk now fell in his Master's cloutch and put not sixpence in his poutch, Here, Canty Muse, e'en take thy breath till the good-wife has spread the claith, for breakfast, and call'd Halbert hame to comfort, and to stuff his wame, with Eggs, tane cawller frae the nest, to be synd down with Scuds the best, Hab tenting with a stare right steady, a swindging mealtith making ready, speer'd at his spouse, wha was to eat? all that great Table fu' of meat, and these ten Eggs were in the pan? indeed they're a' for you goodman, quoth Bessy, smirkingly and leugh, trowth ye deserve them well enough, for I'm right certain since yestreen, Ye've playd a manly part with Jean, as ye imagined, while kind she transfer'd your favours oer to me, sae that instead of a young Lassie you only kissd your ain auld Bessy, and I'll refer'd now to your sell, If ye can ony difference tell, Halbert, by this, heard he was dung but, very wisely, held his Tongue, while Jean and Bessy were sae curst to Laugh, till they were like to burst, Hab in the Joke to[o] bare a part, but had nae laughing at his Heart, thinking how his ain doited pow, had scrow'd him in the Cuckold' Row, which gart him blate, and simple look, and claw him where he didna youk, fast frae them to the Mill he ran to manage matters with his man, and since he coudna better make o't, to tutor Johnie not to speak o't.

Katty Your welcome, Susan, to our haugh. Come, let's gae sing beneath yon saugh. What's aills you that ye dinna laugh With usual glee? Ye're a' begrutten and look baugh; I'm wae to s'ye. Have ye been wrang'd in goods or name, Or girn'd at by our cankard dame, Or has some swankie nought can tame Or ever mend Done that whilk gars us a' think shame Whene'er it's kend? Susan The spring-well canna be mair clear Than I'm frae spots that maidens fear; Sour reek and flyting I could bear Wi' far less pain Than what I thole for ane we ne'er Shall see again. He's dead! Oh Kattie, Johny's dead, Wha daintily coud tune his reed To please the brugh and chear the mead. Nane drave away The dronan frumps wi' faster speed Than Johny Gay. Katty O death, again thy ruthless sting Shall ne'er to mools ane better bring. He was a comrade for a king, And clergy might And mimmest maidens hear him sing With free delight. On summer mornings Pate and I By day-break in the eastlin sky Aft to the highland sheils wad hy, And a' the day, While we on flow'ry braes did ly, Sang Johny Gay. Susan To Gay and to ae other wight We awe our thanks baith day and night, Wha did frae rust and rubish dight Blyth British tunes, Which ane and a' began to slight For outland crunes, Crunes prick'd where princes, poor with pride, To silly saftness sangsters ride. Shoud we, to freedom born, abide Sic fosie notes, Notes that throw unkend language slide And cheepand throats? Katty His ballads a' we blythly sung; The[y] merry made baith auld and young, And shall, while Britons have a tongue To sing or say, Be still in vogue, and praises rung To gentle Gay. How snackly could he with a sneer Jybe chiels that sell their sauls for gear, Nor past he porter, prigg, or peer That fell in's way. Nane hit their blots mair snell and clear Than Gabby Gay. Susan O canty lad, what didst thou mean With Sunday's coat and owrly clean To leave our bughts and bleer our een To seek renown Frae ribbons blue and ribbons green In London toun? Had ony of them e'er the grace To heez thee to some idle place? A daft attempt in thee, alace— Oer mickle wit And honesty bleez'd in thy face That mark to hit. Katty Yet dear Clarinda—bonnier nane Wha grace the court or glad the plain— Great, good, and bountifou, did deign In gracious way To prop, to credit, and maintain The aefauld Gay. His worth she tented, lik'd his sang, And rais'd him frae the vulgar thrang. May a' her years be blyth and lang We sooth-fast pray, Wha frae laigh poortith's wissen'd fang Preserv'd our Gay. Susan Waesme! as aft as I shall keek, On his bound Book, and Shepherd's week, Saut Tears will flood adoun my Cheek It shou'd be sae, Since lang and bootless we may seek, For ane like Gay— I'm sure the Show-fouk o' the Stage, Wha mint to mend the Gawky Age, Will ne'er play o'er his Op'ra page Withouten Grief, For him wha bauldly durst engage Wi' ilka Thief Frae Thieves that under Coro'nets hide, And in their Coach and Sixes ride, To them wha o'er the Country wide, Demand your Purse; Throw' a' their Crooks he was our Guide, And their great Curse. Katty His Roundels a' were snod and sweet, Well taught he how to wawk the Street, On drouthy Days, in Wind and Weet, His Sonnet tells; How we frae mischiefs, we might meet, Should shield our Sells Like snacky Easop too right slee, He with a' Ranks of Men made free, And wyl'd us frae our fau'ts wi' Glee And Moral Saws; Mair pithy, Men of Sense agree, Than stonkard Laws. Susan If honest Teachers have a right, To dwell where never was a Night, If tunefu Sauls rise ever bright, Sure virtuous Gay; Lous'd frae his Cares tow'rs to the Height Of Bleezing Day. But see my Lass yon sooty Cloud, Is burning with a stormy Thud Lets kilt our coats and hame-o'er Scud And cease to mourn, For tho our Een should rain a Flood, He'll ne'er return. TO THE R? HON??? SUSANA, COUNTESS OF EGLINTOUN. The Muse's Salutation, on New Years Day 1733 after the late sickly weather. The Sun, with a' his haelsome Rays, was far to southern nations gane, dreary our nights, and short our Days, Naked, and blashy, was the plain. Nae verdent leaf wav'd on the Tree, Nor flowers upon the meadows blew, Spates flow'd in Lochs upon the Lee, the Heights were of a wissened hew, Nature waxd heavy, sour, and dowf, Dumb were the tunefu shepherds' reeds, Nor coud the Birds the carrols sowf, But droopt the wing and hid their Heads. The Lazy south wind tholl'd the mist to hover thick, oercharg'd with Death, Then feverish mortalls e'er the[y] wist Glow'd in the Cauld and gasp'd for breath. Even Eglintoun, the favourite of Heaven, and its peculiar care, With her dear Blosoms fair and sweet had in the generall grief a share, Blest Fair, still good as thou art great, Ne'er misconstruct the will of Heaven On virtue still waits happy fate, And soon all oddness is made even Some wandering twangs of humane pain Make full amends for their annoys, When by the canny cast we gain A better gust for honest Joys, Hast[e], Zyphers, blaw the welkin clear, Drive a' the stagnant damps away; Phebus return, with this new year and bless us with thy Shining Day. A good New Year to Eglintoun, on her and on her Lovely Care, Heaven pour thy best of favours doun and lang a life sae precious spare, Daughters of Thule that wad shine With a' that captivates the Heart, Copy a patern sae divine And rise aboon affected art, Do good things, in a gracefu way, be never mean, nor puff'd with pride, Mingle the solid, with the gay, Beauty, and Honour, neer divide Then shall the admiring world allow that you've coppyd happylie and well bright Eglintoun, the standard true, in whom the conquering charms excell.

I charge ye by these royall names, Frae Fergus Furst, to Octave James, As loyalty you still exprest, To mind your friend whan he's distrest, Distrest wi' little trading gawin, And the driegh income of what's awin, The curst peremptor, London bills, That gif return'd, our credit kills. Then there's the necessars of life, That crave frae ane that has a wife, House-hawding, baith in milk and meall, And mutton, beef, and shanks o' veall; Nay, now and then, aff care to syne A sneaker, or a waught o' wine; And that the getlings prove na fools, They maun be hawden att the schools. All these require the ready down Frae us wha live in Borrowstown, That neither hae nor barn, nor byre, Washing, nor elding for our fire; Nor sheep, nor swine, or hens, or geese, Nor sarking lint, or claithing fleece, Unless that Dubbies-land be staickit By us, we e'en may strutt stark naiket And starve—While ye jock upo' lands, Have ilka thing laid to your hands Of whatsoe'er ye stand in need, Of your ain growth and your ain breed. Frae udders of your kine and ewes Your cream, your cheese, your butter flows; Your eggs and chickens (best o' fare) Are yours, withouten ony care; The nursing hen asks nae mair pay, But only what ye fling away; Whane'er ye like ye cram your creels Wi' trouts, and pikes, and carps, and eels; Horse-laids of fruit bob on your trees, The honey's brought you by the bees; Roots for your pott ye hae in plenty, Wi' artichoaks, and bow-kaill dainty; For gryce and goslings, calves and lamb, Ye've meickle mair, nor can ye cramm; Your bannocks, grow upon your strae Your barley, brings you usquebae. From what I've said, its eith to prove You shou'd not filthy lucre love; What use for cash hae landwart lairds, Unless to play't att dice or cards, If useless in your poutch, 't wears less, Until it grows as smooth as glass. Now since it obvious is and plain, That coin so worthless is and vain Wi' such as you—Let me advise ye Ne'er let regards for it intice ye, To haud your hands o'er hard about it, And since we canna fend without it, Pray gather't up, white, yellow, brown, And pack it in to our poor town. Now either do this same, frae hand Or keep it; and gie us the land. Before you een sett wicked Tray, That barking satt upo' the stray, Yet cou'dna mak a meall of meat o't, But wadna let poor horsie eat o't. Wadd ye to what I say agree, Ye soon wou'd ken what drinkers drie. Thus far, Sir, I have merry been, As a sworn enemy to spleen, And hearty friends, like us, weell ken, There's nought ill said, thats no ill ta'en. My proper view, ye'll eithly find Was mainly to put you in mind I wad be vext, were ye unkind; But never having reason gi'en, I hope you're still what ye hae been, As you in mony ways did show it, The Friend and Patron of your Poet. A. R. UPON THE RIGHT REV(EREN)D RALPH ERSKIN [1737] Behold the man whose tunefull tone would melt a very heart of stone, When he against the Drunkard roars or lays about him at the Whores. O thou great whore of Babel fear thy forsaid downfall draweth near For Ralf the Seir, Ralf hath said thou on thy Back shall soon be laid, This is the man who far and near the Marrow Moderns flock to hear, Him prove these Brethren want a missive that take the Oaths and Are Submissive, Who blinded with the light of Reason, find out no Godliness in Treason, Obeying laws like Simple Sotts to which Black Bishops gave their Votes, Who only preach against our Crimes but never touch upon the Times, While Such in Common Doctrines juggle, Great Ralf converts with Rhime &amp; Ridle, All hail Dunfermling's shining star thy face &amp; verse shall travell far, And make mae people laugh &amp; sleep, than 'eer thy Sermons caus'd to weep.

TO MR. JAMES HOME Sir, These two volumes come to prove Your poet's gratitude and love To you whose taste and friendly spirit Encourage the least mints of merit Impartially, without regard, Whether in shepherd, lord or laird; For which and many another favour That bind me to my best behaviour I from this honest heart of mine Beg you t'accept this small propine. Tho scant the value, yet believe It is the best that I can give, And the most proper, you'll allow, For me to give to such as you. Then with a friendly smile admit Me 'mongst your laughing friends, to wit: Shoot yont your Milton and your Pope, That chant sublime from the hill-top; Make me a birth whin that I may Cram in with Butler, Matt, and Gay; That when the spleen or ought that's sour Attacks you in a drumbly hour, With these may Allan come before you And to your gayity restore ye. If I in this can recommend My Muse to you, I've gained my end. And if you own that I can sowff A song or tale, nor dull nor dowf, At some with no small pride I'll sneer, Whose noddles are not quite so clear, And never tent their grumble While you stand by your Servant humble, Allan Ramsay. From my closet in Edr, August 10th, 1738. EPISTLE TO MR. H. S. AT LONDON NOV? 1738 To me, far in the frozen north, in winter on the banks of Forth, where Boreas thuds with all his Strength, through Nights of eighteen hours of Length, ther's hardly aught coud please me better than friendly love &amp; your kind letter, Happy the man who needs not roam, but when he pleases, from his home, who, when the Summer fields invite and healthfull Hunting his delight, can tire out a whole pack of Hounds upon his oun paternall Grounds, then soon as Winter gins to frown in Coach and Six wheel to the Toun, there ratle about, in spangl'd cloathing, in mighty hurry doing—nothing, unless for Nation's good, or so the Orator says—Yes or No. But we, who by our cast of fate have not been tagg'd to an Estate, must rouze up all our thinking Arts, to ravish fortune by our parts, now here, now there, whiles up, whiles down, plodding for Rhino, or Renown, should put our Tallents to the Test, and of our Bargins make the best, for, while gay Hopes are our support faith all our Labour's but a sport, and in our turn, ev'n in their faces, can laugh at Lords, &amp; even their Graces, who rust unactive, standing still, turn heavy, having all their will, sunk oft in spleen, of life they tire, Born to their best, they rise no higher, the Stream of Joy must still grow less when no more springs make it increase, Ye want to know, ye say, what passes Amongst the Edinburgh Lads &amp; Lasses, 'Mongst Statesmen, and Kirk moderators, 'Mongst Gamsters, Bawds, &amp; fornicators, Then be it known, in this same place folk seem as little crampt with grace, as the unhallowd crouds who dwell from Wapping west to the Pall-Mall. the Scarlet Whore, indeed, they snarl at but like right well a whore in scarlet, and here, in plenty, ev'ry Lad may have them in all collours clad, from the silk Damask doun to Tartane that's manufactur'd at Dunbartane, a choice of goods, &amp; mighty cheap, for one a pox or clap may reap, if with but litle pains he'll try, for sixpence wet &amp; sixpence dry, and, if he's not a simple Stirk, may bite the Treasurer of the Kirk, for now, none heeds that dismall Dunner, unless it be some sighing Sinner, Thus whore, &amp; Bawd, Doctor &amp; pox, the Tavern &amp; a large white Ox, are the whole sum for Lord or clown of the Diversions of our Town, since by a late sour-snouted law which makes great Heroes stand in awe the morall Teachers of broad Truths have gotten padlocks on their mouths, fierce Bajezet, and bold Macbeth Othello, Cato, &amp; Macheath, now dumb, and of their Buskins stript, our stage is in its blossom nipt, which spreads ane universall frown to see a Theater pull'd down, which for seven years, at small expence, had pleasd, without the least offence, advanced a great way to remove that Scarcrow of all social Love, Enthousiastick vile delusion which glorys in stift-rumpt confusion, gives sanction to Rebellious plots, and finds out grace in cutting Throats, which, in the reigns of James &amp; Charles, prompted these Covenanted Quarles and heezd the Leaguers up the Ladders to swing aloft in hempen Tedders, now since the softener of this rage, the mannerly reforming Stage, is tane away, 'tis justly dreaded, 'twill be by Biggotry succeeded, Divisions from Divisions spring, and partys spiteful dart the sting, My friend be blyth, nor fash your Head with nick-nack of each different creed that various molds the Golden Calf from stile of Rome to that of Ralf yet never from these virtues start which spring up in an honest Heart quite strangers to the party Squable which mads the great &amp; litle Rable, enjoy your Laugh, your friend, &amp; Glass, and, with chast Love, a chosen Lass, sleep sound &amp; never break your brains, whither the Turk, or Russian gains, Farewell, &amp; let me be your debtor for what would over-cram a letter, till we meet fairly nose to nose, then balance shall be payd in prose. ON GEORGE WHITEFIELD THE STROLLING PREACHER [1741] Now Reverend S[i]r, after your wandering, your Theiving, whooring, and your squandring you may rejoyce, that you at last on Scotland happylie are cast where wildnes oft starts to extream and men of lungs may somthing seem amongst old women of both sexes, who admire what Reason's light perplexes tho' mostly folk of every Rank deem you a mumping Montebank yet Self-Sufficiency and noise new nonsence and a canting voice oft pass for grace &amp; Doctrine true amongst the giddy-headed crew. Here you succesfully erected your stage and was by priests protected. there acted oft, nor playd in vain the fable of your Georgian Scene . . . unless their souls they strive to save by giving you—all that they have. Hail Englangs bold St. George the Second! who hast the Infernall Dragon weaken'd! roar on loud Champion, neer knock under till you have fell'd him flat's a flounder. But may we ask by whose permission, by what Authority or Comission, by what Law Custom or example, or who imposd a task so ample on you to act and use a diction like Apostolick Jurisdiction who but your self did e'er assume who but your self did eer presume to hack about &amp; ape these Leaders who were the first great Gospell Spreaders Paul &amp; Peter both we knew, but start-up Whitefield who art thou Doubtles you'll not accept a post less than that of thirteenth of th'apostles of Methodists Generall Reciever which some translate a grand Deciever In common wealths where'er you haunted a beggar snack as ever canted All Hail, thou devilish deep Divine whose Theologicall Engine has got the start of Archimedes All Hail, thou devilish deep Divine offered, if given a proper Station he'd move the Earth &amp; its foundation the place you've found, &amp; we have seen, eclipt a Tent upon the Green in which your lucky stance you take and make th'Inferiour world to shake that some part therof with much speed you have cleverly turnd Arse o'er head. O Sovran Seer who by pretended mission, with zeal officious blended which rather looks like a possession then aught of Sacred Inspiration Thou'st by thy vague licentious claver thy bauling bullocking behaviour most subtily thy self intruded on the mean croud &amp; them deluded At the loud roar of sound's expence unaided by perswasive sence yet their long ears have been much kitled even while their simple souls you bittled that they durst think nought good or holy but what was said by Whitefield soley, their Squinting Guide—to Mamon true honest as a stockjobing Jew fit qualitys for such a Jugler a practised Simon Magus smugler. For certain George this self conceit of yours that blows you up this rate must spring from an opinion vile you have of this part of the Isle We oun we have a share of fools that on occasion may prove Tools to villains who with fair pretences can cast the glamour o'er their Sences and artfully can throw in faggots to kindle up their fanatick maggots these set aside the greater part are worthy and of true desert Just Temperate learned Brave &amp; wise whose touring Geniouses can rise sublime to all thats great &amp; bright beyond the reach of thy weak sight.

M.Y.L.H.S. A.R. Ed? the last day of the year 1746 TO DOCTOR BOSWELL With the Two Vols. of my Poems. These are the flowings from my Quill, when in my youthful days I scamper'd o'er the Muses' Hill, and panted after praise. Ambitious to appear in print, my Labour was delyte, Regardless of the envious Squint, or growling Critick's Spite. While those of the best Taste and Sence indulg'd my native fire, It bleezed by their benevolence, and heaved my genius higher. Dear Doctor Boswell, such were they, resembled much by you, Whose favours were the genial ray by which to fame I grew. From my first setting out in Rhime, near fourty years have wheeld, Like Israel's Sons, so long a Time through fancy's wiles I've reeld. May powers propitious by me stand, since it is all my claim, As they enjoyed their promised land, may I my promised fame. While Blythness then on health attends, and love on Beauty's young, My merry Tales shall have their friends, and Sonnets shall be sung. Sir, your humble Servant, Allan Ramsay From my Bower on the Castle Bank of Edinburgh, March the 10th, 1747. [EPITAPH ON ROBERT MYLNE] [1747] Faith Master Death, 'tis but a scurvy job, To pay a visit to our friend ‘Old Rob’; He liked good company, 'tis passing true, But truly never would have thought of you. AN EPISTLE WROTE FROM MAVISBANK MARCH 1748 TO A FRIEND IN EDR. Dear friend to smoak and noise confine'd which Soils your Shirt, and frets your mind, and makes you rusty look, and crabbed, as if you were bepoxed, or Scabbed, or had been going through a dose of Mercury, to save your Nose, let me advise you, out of pity, to leave the chattering, Stinking city, wher pride, and Shallowness, take place of plain Integrety, and grace, where hidious Screams, would kill a Cat, of who buys this or who buys that, and through the Day from break of Mornings the buz of Bills, protests, and Hornings, besides the everlasting Squable amongst the great and litle Rable who tear their Lungs, &amp; deave your Ears, with all their party hopes and fears, while ratling o'er their silly Cant, learn'd from the Mercury, and Currant, about the Aid that comes from Russia, and the neutrality of Prussia, of ffrance's Tyranie and Slavery, of Holands Selfishness &amp; knavery, of Spain, the most beloved Son of the old whore of Babylon, the Guardian of her whips &amp; fagots and all her superstitious magots, of all his gambols on the Green with Hungary's Imperial Queen, of Genoa's resolute resistance without Napolitan assistance, of passing Var, seiging Savona, and breaking fidles at Cremona, of how much Blood &amp; dirt is cost before a Town is won or lost, of Popes, Stateholders, faith's Deffenders, Generals, Marshals, and pretenders, of Treaties, Ministers, and Kings, and of a Thousand other Things, of all which their Conceptions Dull, sutes with the thickness of the Scull, yet with such Stuff one must be worried, that's through the City gauntlet hurried. But Ah! ye cry the dear dear Dances with Beautys brisk, who harm our fancys, for five or six gay hours complete in circles of the Assembly Sweet, who can forsake so fair a field where all to conquering Beauty yield. no doubt while in this am'rous fit your next plea's Boxes, and the pit, where wit, and humours of the Age flow entertaining from the Stage, where, if the Drama's right conducted, one's both diverted and instructed. Well I shall grant it bears with Reason these have their charms in proper Season, but must not be indulg'd too much, lest they the Soften'd Soul bewitch, and faculties in fetters bind that are for greater ends design'd. then, rouze ye from these dosing Dreams, come view with me the golden Beams, which, Phebus, every Morning pours upon the plains, adorn'd with flowers, with me o'er springing verdures stray, where wimpling watters make their way, here from the Oak with Ivy bound you'll hear the soft melodious Sound of all the Choiresters on hy whose notes re-echoe through the skie, better than concerts of your Town, yet do not cost you half a crown, here Blackbirds, Mavises &amp; Linnets, excell your fidles, flutes, &amp; Spinnets, next we may mount the broomy Height and wild, wide Landskips chear our Sight, diverted with the bleating Tribe, and plough-men whistling oer the Glibe, Thus we, with little Labour, gain firm Health, and all its Joyfull Train, silent repose, the chearfull Smile, which best intruding cares beguile, and makes the Springs of Life to flow through every vein with kindly glow, giving the Cheek a rosie teint surpassing all the arts of paint. The Heights survey'd, we may return along the Margin of the Burn, where fishes will divert your Eye while jumping up to catch a fly, which taught the Angler first to wait and Hook them with the tempting Bait, next the fair Gardens we may trace where art adds life to Native grace, The Walls &amp; Espaliers Load, &amp; lined, with fruits of the best chosen kind, the Borders fraughted with delight, to please the Smelling, &amp; the Sight, while Ecchoe entertains the Ear when rais'd by Notes well tune'd, &amp; clear, Such Morning walks, the Balmy Air, improves the gust for healthy fair, and, when the Bell for Breakfast rings, at heels you'll find Hermetick wings, to reach a Table, neatly crownd, with all that's hearty, hale, &amp; sound, where in the shining vessels stand Blessings of Jacob's promised Land, of which with freedom you may share, for ceremony comes not there. Nature refresh'd, you may retire with Books that jump with your Desire, if cloudy Skies keep you within, you've Closets warm &amp; free from Din, where in the well degested pages you may review the by past ages, or, with great Newton, take a flight through all the rolling Orbs of Light, their order note their bulk &amp; shine 'till fire'd with raptures all divine, or with the pen, and pincell's aid, trace nature out in Light &amp; Shade with freedom, in a bold out line, like Sachi, or Salvator, shine. If Zyphers, and the radiant bleeze, invite you to the Shady Trees, some hours, in indolence, to pass extended on the velvet gras, with Milton, Pope, &amp; all the Rest, who smoothly coppy Nature best, their Lays inspired, peruse, and find, what brightens, and improves, the Mind, and carrys it a pitch beyond, these views, of which Low Minds are fond. This is the Life, all those have sung, most to be wish'd by old, and young, by the most Brave, and the most ffair, where Least Ambition, least of Care, desturbs the Soul, where virteous Ease, and Temperance, never cease to please.

To be by vain ambition led, to have fifty Thieves in livery clad, with Cooks from frothy ffrance all able with foolish fare to spread my Table, Supported by large funds of wealth and funds more worthy peace &amp; health, than to wheel the Luxurious round of Pleasures sensuall and unsound, I had rather like the earlyest men on herbs and Acorns make a fen, all free of Buz in health to sing while cheap I quaf the Cauller spring, and pass my circling hours with Joy which glaring pride should neer destroy, with neither Drabs nor Duns opprest to croud my Dreams or break my rest, or hinder me to bless my sight with Nature in a proper light, while by the fresh &amp; rosie Dawn I haunt the Stream or trace the lawn. That mortall's foolish beyond measure whose pride enslaves his truest pleasure, and makes him act what's vile &amp; low to keep of Greatness a vain show, weak coward minds who cant endure the Scandall of being reckond poor, preferring vice with titled shine, to humble virtue's Rays Divine. Blest is the man whose happy fate has plac'd him 'twixt the Small and Great, who independant can make choice of life, both free of Toil and Noise, and can, in Leasure hours resort, to Streams &amp; Moors for healthfull Sport, and for delight, and manly ends, enjoys his Garden, Books, &amp; ffriends. O George, you have it in your power to sweeten life each wheeling hour, while in the virtuous list you stand and passions guide with Steady hand, Indulgent Heaven has given you all that's needfull on this rolling Ball, with a Help Meet whose merits prove her well deserving of your Love, while Beauty, Sence, &amp; Virtue, claim Stations in Rolls of worthy fame, then to your Lot your wishes bound so shall your life with Joys be crown'd, nor envy him whose wider fields than yours an higher Rentall yields, for tis Content can only claim every Estate to make the same, since happynes then is confin'd to the emotions of the mind, the Odds will turn out very Brief between Dumlanrig &amp; Drumcrief. [THE EXCOMMUNICATION OF RALPH ERSKINE] [1749] The Synode to old Sathan sends the Compliments of all his friends to inform him, by their right Divine they intend to make him a propine of Brethren who reprov'd grow stiffer and in some whitty-whattys differ doing our cause sa mekle skaith by favouring the Burgher Aith for which we Masters Gib &amp; Brown to raise your Belzieships renown have come to a full resolution for fixing our constitution by solemn excomunication to sneg such off from their salvation and first we shall begin with Ralf that bungling ballad singing calf who in his rhiming fidle didles turnd the plain gospell into ridles for which and taking Aiths to Kings and whateer clips Seceding wings. To cure all such upsprouting evils we give him up to all the Devils to lick him with their Taz so snell doun the deepest pot of Hell. VERSES ADDRESST TO THE MAVIS WELL WHICH FLOWS IN THE GARDENS OF MAVIS BANK O fountain, favourit of fate! hou early happy is thy state soon as from Earth's dark cells thou springs, at thy clear Head, the Mavis sings, Joyn'd with th'hermonious choirs of mirth to hail &amp; celebrate thy birth, no sooner thou beholds the light than Nature's beautys glad thy sight, and Flora with her frag'rant gales all her refreshing scents retails, Pomona with luxuriant Loads Presents the Nectar of the Gods, delighted with the croud of sweets which Thee to Paradice invites, with rapid rush, adoun thou pours to incorporate with the fruits &amp; flowers, their roots to lave, &amp; drouth expell Midst them thy stores collected swell, into a pond which to the Eye reflects the glorys of the skie, reflects the Nymphs of gracefull mein, who tred arround thy margin green, and with their songs artfull &amp; sweet make Ecchoe from thy Head repete, was it oer thee, say limpid spring, that the vain fop his head did hing? where, daz'led with his oun dear Charms, he fled the enamour'd virgin's arms, Ay sure it was, for here, poor voice! near Thee residing makes her choice whence, from on high, she sees below her still belov'd Narcissus grow— O fountain, favourite of fate! what muse thy merits can relate! hou gratefull to the Taste, hou good to staunch our drouth, &amp; cool the blood, for ever may thy spring still flow and on the cheek make Health to glow. A. R. Mavis-Bank, June 15th TO Sir ALEXander DICK OF PRESTONFIELD, BARONET, WITH MR. RAMSAY'S POEMS IN THIS AND SECOND VOLUME My worthy friend, whose polish'd mind Springs far aboon the common kind Since in my verses you can find What prompts your praise, Allow yourself to be propined With all my lays. When I was clever, blyth, and young, In strain stile of my mother tongue What Nature dictated I sung. Now as on columns, Them fair, forever, I have hung Up in these volums. O! may they always have the power To tune your saull, should it grow sour, And clear up ilka gloomy hour. When spleen is fashous, May they make cankerd care to cour With smiles sagacious. May you and your fair partner lang Enjoy life free of ilka twang. To con my tales and sowf ilk sang Can pleasure bring Till ripe in years aloft we spang With saints to sing. Our sauls then freed frae hools of clay, There we may hope to sing and say All that is great, divinely gay, And flights extend O'er space immence, wher joy and day Shall never end. Qd Allan Ramsay the Auther. Anno Domini: 1755 Etats suae LXX. AN EPISTLE TO JAMES CLERK, ESQ. OF PENNYCUIK Blyth may he be wha o'er the haugh, All free of care, may sing and laugh; Whase owsen lunges o'er a plain Of wide extent, that's a' his ain. No humdrum fears need break his rest, Wha's not with debts and duns opprest; Wha has enough, even tho' it's little, If it can ward frae dangers kittle, That chiels, fated to skelp vile dubs thro', For living are oblig'd to rub thro', To fend by troaking, buying, selling, The profit's aft no worth the telling. When aft'er, in ane honest way, We've gained by them that timely pay, In comes a customer, looks big, Looks generous, and scorns to prig, Buys heartily, bids mark it down, He'll clear before he leaves the town; Which, tho' they say't, they ne'er intend it; We're bitten fair, but canna mend it. A year wheels round, we hing about; Hes sleeping, or he's just gane out: If catch'd, he glooms like ony devil, Swears braid, and calls us damn'd uncivil: Or aft our doited lugs abuses, With a ratrime of cant excuses; And promises they stoutly ban to, Which they have ne'er a mind to stand to. As lang's their credit hads the feet o't, They hound it round to seek the meat o't, Till jointly we begin to gaud them, And Edinburgh grows o'er het to had them: Then aff they to the country scowp, And reave us baith of cash and hope. Syne we, the lovers of fair dealing, Wha deem ill payment near to stealing, Rin wood with care how we shall pay Our bills against the destin'd day; For lame excuse the banker scorns, And terrifies with caps and horns; Nae trader stands of trader awe, But nolens volens gars him draw. 'Tis hard to be laigh poortith's slave, And like a man of worth behave; Wha creeps beneath a laid of care, When interest points he's gleg and gare, And will at naithing stap or stand, That reeks him out a helping hand. But here, dear Sir, do not mistake me, As if grace did sae far forsake me, As to allege that all poor fellows, Unblest with wealth, deserv'd the gallows. Na, God forbid that I should spell Sae vile a fortune to mysell, Tho' born to not ae inch of ground, I keep my conscience white and sound; And tho' I ne'er was a rich heaper, To make that up I live the cheaper; By this ae knack I've made a shift To drive ambitious care a-drift; And now in years and sense grown auld, In ease I like my limbs to fauld. Debts I abhor, and plan to be Frae shochling trade and danger free, That I may, loos'd frae care and strife, With calmness view the edge of life; And when a full ripe age shall crave, Slide easily into my grave. Now seventy years are o'er my head, And thirty mae may lay me dead; Should dreary care then stunt my muse, And gar me aft her jogg refuse? Sir, I have sung, and yet may sing, Sonnets that o'er the dales may ring, And in gash glee couch moral saw, Reese virtue and keep vice in awe; Make villainy look black and blue, And give distinguish'd worth its due; Fix its immortal fame in verse, That men till doomsday shall rehearse. I have it even within my pow'r, The very kirk itself to scow'r, And that you'll say's a brag right bauld; But did not Lindsay this of auld? Sir David's satyres help'd our nation To carry on the Reformation, And gave the scarlet whore a box Mair snell than all the pelts of Knox. Thus far, Sir, with no mean design, To you I've poured out my mind, And sketch'd you forth the toil and pain Of them that have their bread to gain With cares laborious, that you may, In your blest sphere be ever gay, Enjoying life with all that spirit That your good sense and virtues merit. Adieu, and ma' ye as happy be As ever shall be wish'd by me. Your ever obliged, humble servant, Allan Ramsay. Pennycuick, May 9, 1755. (2) Poems for which dates have not been established.

THE TYKES TOOLY Of all the Rangers of the Moor fair Juno was the greatest whore, none froister scowered the Knows and Bogs, She was a Toast among the Dogs, but, ah! what dire mischeifs are spred! from ills, by Love and Beauty bred, Empires distroy'd, and private Jars, Assasinations, bloody wars, thus fierce were Toolys 'mongst the Tykes for Juno, when she took the sykes, even blood-relation pled no grace 'mongst the Love-bitten barking race, The father in the madest Ire 'gainst the Son's throple did conspire, and uncle curst thought it no sin to rive his yowling nevoy's skin, for Juno's Love, the panting croud Shew'd all their fangs, &amp; gowld aloud, Ringwood, Ranger, Tray, &amp; Towser, Ventured their heart's blood to espouse her, The rageing Pack, all in a fury Gowl, snarl, &amp; bite, &amp; tear, &amp; worry, 'till many a Dog with gaping wound, and horrid yelling, bitt the ground, and meikle blood, and dirt, was shed, before the Amorous plea was redd. Like them the Humane race appears who go togither by the Ears, and think it an Heroick play to murder thousands in a day, and when the Bloody race is run by either side ther's nothing won, Our Tale, this Morall fairly teaches Mankind act oft like Dogs &amp; Bitches. THE BROAD HINT CUNNINGLY ANSWERD In ripened years, when Blood flows cool, then mankind cease to play the fool, grow very cautious, grave, &amp; wise. and prodigall of good advice, the courses that themselves run throw, they hardly to their Bairns allow. Patricius for his merits known which none who knew him would disown, was now arriv'd to that same age which can oppose love's fiercest rage, tho in his youth, some would debate it, he took a Rugg when he could get it, He had a son, a hearty youth, who lov'd to smack a pretty mouth, the lad was lively, brisk, &amp; keen, not much to ceremony gi'en, who thought, when nature was inviting, one should not take too long entreating, nor cavil much about her Laws when one could show a good because, Some maiden auld of envious nature, or chaplain, sour malicious creature, officiously had told the Laird that his son John had no regard, to Laws cannonicall or civell but amongst Lasses playd the Devil, Thought fornication was no sin, and whored about throw' thick &amp; thin, unterified at claps &amp; poxes, Repenting-stools or the Kirk-Boxies. One evening as the son &amp; father by a warm Ingle sat togither where tired with Rambles of the Day upon the hearth lay favourite Tray to whom thus spoke by way of squint the squire that son might take the hint: Ye silly cur, what is't bewitches you thus to galop after Bitches the live-lang day oer Riggs &amp; Bogs fighting with all the wicked Dogs wasting your strength for litle thanks and getting riven spauls &amp; shanks?” John understood his father's drift when luckylie to lend a lift a little whelp of humour gay woud fain have had some game with Tray he pauted at his hinging luggs and somtimes at his tail he druggs which sport the auld &amp; sullen Tike by snaps &amp; girns seem'd to dislike John to the auld dog spoke, thus slee get out ye cankerd curr cryd he, your Eild &amp; Sourness gar ye snarl and with the wanton whelpie quarell you have forgot—(your manners tell) that you was anes a whelp your Sell. BABBAND AND TITTYPOW A Persian Tale Imitated from the Original of Yas Marnalla, Pleasant to Siuvatio, Governour of the Three Spicy Valeys. How lady after she grew sickly Without a testment drapt aff quickly, To nae sma tinsel of stepdoughter When twa grave pows came in and hought her I sing the tale to toun and landart, And verity shall be the standart. Nor need I the lang-nebit diction That's aften used to varnish fiction. Thus far, as porter or Swiss sentrey Preface well bred stands in the entrey. Then wauk in, gentles, we are just showing The honest stepmother a going. Baband the dervise, her relation, Bestows what's calld for in his station; Of which he gies a rantan rug Of thae things grown amaist a drug— Whyt een, heh heys, and greetin grunzie, And sic wares as cost little cunzie. E'en while she had the use of breath And his right not secured by death, In part of payment the sweet singer Steals twa gowd rings frae aft her finger. In the mean time snack Tittypow Is doing a' that e'er she dow To see that ilk thing be in order When Madam's on the mortall border. This she performs wi' meikle care Till the rich relict is nae mair. What joy it gies dependant's heart When wealthy friend daigns to depart! Now there's nae cheeks blabed wi' tears But blythness throu' forced glooms appears. Soon's Atropos had used her gooly, A' hands to wark about the spooly. “Deal honest,” quoth stepdoughter heires[s], “Ye's get a skair and that right fair is.” “Young miss, ye'r servant,” quoth Mess Jon, “There is nae testment; pray, stand yon. Lear to be civil in your carriage. Ye're nae bairn of the second marriage, Nor did ae drap of her blood ever Glow in your cheek or warm your liver. But wee ar her ain nearest of kin And think it nowther shame nor sin To nick ye fine and upo' sight to Sease ilky thing she claimed a right to. Tis mair, indeed, than I expected, But since the latter-will's neglected, Come, lass, gie's in a glass of claret— A hale fou bottle, let's nae spare it. I plainly see that ane had twice Better be canny than be wise.” He took his penfou very dously, Then fell a plundering unco crously, But quarrel shor'd to happen niest Tween Tittypow and canny priest Till he was forced to condescend That Titt should have her dividend. “Then this be yours and that be mine; All's fair, an ther's nane els comes in.” Nought in the house escaped their cloutches, With very meal they cramn'd their poutches. What in our youthhood we recive We natruly bear to the grave; Tho set a beggar o'er a leal flock, His mind will hanker to a meal poke. A butter lump, in May well sauted, Their gabs baith watterd to be at it. The holy man linkt out a lingle And hav'd it soon wi' little pingle, Then slap dash nievs in nuckle deep Ilk ane their parts peremptor keep. Speets and racks, pots, pans, and caudrons, The lady's messen and poor baudrans, Bowies, lugies, spoons, and dishes, And things wherin fouk s?s and p?s Are a' laid hands on by the truffer. The cocks and hens, poor fowls, maun suffer; Alak, yer kind auld lady's cavie Frae hungrey maws nae mair will save ye. Now whiles a tiptaes, whiles on hunkers, They scrambled throu presses and bunkers. 'Mang mony things the garesome harlot Fand a gay miekle deug of scarlet And cryd she'd keep it a' thegither For under-mutches to her mither. To these fair miss had sma regard And without scruple coud have spared, But when she saw ilk sneaking divel Sae cursed greedy and uncivil To take the jewels and the rings, The watch, and sindrey castly things That had pertaind to her ain mither, Gi'en to her stepdame by her father, Her heart b[e]ing fou—as well it might— She asked them as her proper right. Reply'd ane o' the duddy kin, “Whisht, Mestres, gie's less o' yer din. It setts you well, indeed, to speer Gin wee'll twin wi' sic wally gear To beet your vanity and pride. They'll look as well hung at my side.” “Ay, sister,” said the cussion dadder, “Really, sic things make wenches madder. They shouldna hae diamonds and watches That deal in fardingales and patches. I coudna answer to my conscience If I consented to her vain sense.” Neist when they had this point decided, The siller plate maun be divided; Which they perform'd with equal scales And left fair miss to bite her nails. Wow, but they coud bauth laigh and clean, Frae gowd and siller to a preen. Bootless she strave her case to mend— She's ay snigg'd off at the wob end. Beds, bousters, blankets, sheets, and codds, Courtains, hingings, twilts, and rods, Table linnen, body cleathing— In short, the greedy rooks left naithing. They gutted servant lass's bed, And thus grave Babband to her said: “Ye maun gae hame and spin wi' me Or els ye's ne'er be pay'd your fee. But for sae lang, mind what I tell, Young miss may lair to sair hersell.” The very sheets they sought away Off bed where this young lady lay; Wi' much difficulty and skill Only in this she gain'd her will, And that indeed was nae sma ferly When ilka thing's consider'd nerly, For the sweet creature to her sorrow Oblidg'd was a' things else to borrow. They left na the worth of a snishing But stoury floor and bare partition. A mop was like to saw dissention And jumble up a great contention, But after meikle wark and cangle (Deel speed the liars, threep and brangle!) Auld cleave-a-hair wi' solemn face He spake and said: “Here lys the case. My wife, ye ken, lives far frae Reeky; Then Tittypow I woud beseek ye, Since ye live here upo' the spot Gie her the map, and nae mair o't.” “I'll hae,” quo Titt then, “spite the nose ye, The lady's breeks that keept her cossie.” “I beg your pardon,” quo Mess John, “Upon your a?e they's ne'er gae on. They for my spouse will do fow fine And stap her gab frae seeking mine, Wha aftentimes has wat her cheeks Because I wadna yeild the breeks.” “I'll draw them aff again,” quo Titt, “Gin e'er her buttocks in them sit. Then had your chafts, make nae mair stir, I loo to be as warm as her.” Now ye maun ken after auld Madam Was boughted wi' the bairns of Adam, They sent express for further augment Of former stock to glean ilk fragment; Moolings of plumbcake, short bread, bisket Gart soup-up clean into a basket, And wine left or in glass or stoups, Wi' a' remaining candle dowps That douminies loos dowps may a' say Was well observ'd by servant lassie. Well, embassy was trew transacted, And crumbs and dribles up were paked, After transferd with carefou care Into hands of dividing pair. What qwam of conscience it coud be Possest them, mair's than kend by me— But back, O generous, they sent The bitts and dribs, rare complement. But dire mischance! There is a sort Of greedy gleds hing at the port, Wha for the sake of king and land Grip a' the goods are counterband And pro and con ne'er stand to argue. These made a seasure of the cargo, Syne after claught to his skair And swaloud this sma bill of fare. Frae a that has been sung or said Some application should be made. First, for improvement let me tell ye In a ye do forgetna selly And never slight a gowden offer [To]gather gear into your coffer. [Think] but a freet these auld wifes tales [Of] justice wi her kittle scales, For ane that's rich can eith exhoner His making free [w]ith her and honnour. If you wi' brass can theek your front And pit a good grave face upon't, Ye may scelp throw baith thick and thin, Do ought and ne'er be charged wi sin. A second lesson's worth your hearing Tho ne'er a barrell better herring; That is, men may have great preten[ses] To sanctity, yet want the sens[es] Of real virtue and good man[ners] If they of lucre can be gainer[s]. This I have scottished frae a scroll Of a gush oriental drol Frae virteous vien to—Awband On ilky Tittypow and Babband. AN ELEGY ON MR. SAMUEL CLERK RUNNING STATIONER Ye curious Readers now may Cark, And greet frae aff your Cheeks the Bark, Since doolfu Death, that greedy Shark, Has cut the thread Of Life, and sent poor Samuel Clerk, Doun to the Dead. Wha now alace! when its in Season, Will publish Span-new Rhime and Reason, Mix't now and then with blads of Treason, Folks are sae fleed— There's few will venture Craig and Weason, Since Samuel's Dead. He was of a well-kend Vocation, A Stationer without a Station; Wha travell'd much to serve the Nation Wi' Essays to read, Against or for the' Administration, But now he's Dead— Just as the Pamphlet brought in Siller He was ilk Party's pithy Pillar; Nor did he value an ill-willer, Yet bare nae feud, To ony Man but Andrew Miller, Whom he wish'd Dead. When he was young his Parents kind, Him for the Clergy Craft design'd Amang the Brethren to have shin'd, But his wise Head— To Arts mair usefou was inclined, But now he's Dead. His Saul sublimer could na bear, The Sturt, the Struggle, strife, and Steer, Hair-cleaving, grano-salis weir, About the Creed; And calling ane annither Liar, But now he's Dead. Wharfor as said is he withdrew, Frae that ill-hair'd contentious Crew, Of the auld usance or the new, Wha ne'er agreed; In ought but the rich living view, But now he's Dead. In Claiths he was nor fine nor gaudy, In Actions humble as a Cadie, In Eloquence he spake braid Baudy, With open mouth; His greatest plague frae a gaw'n Laddie, Was deadly Drouth. Delicious Drams were his Delight, Which every Morning set him right, Nine to his forenoon upon Sight He well could Skreed; Besides a pint of Tipon-tight, But now he's Dead. Aft did his Landlady and He, About the premises agree, With pledge ye Samuel, and here's t'ye, Which clear'd the Head; And warm'd the Wame better than Tea, And yet he's Dead. What else he acted with this Lady, The Muse say'th not, tho some are ready, To swear he try'd to be a Dady, But came nae speed; He being not o'er stout or steady, For sic a Deed. Ye laughan Lads wha like good Liquors, And in Platoons bend round the Bickers, And with Deray drive down the Nickers Your Sport suspend; Sink your sad snouts like Seggs or wickers, For Samuel's end. Of all within the Walls of Reeky, This should allarm the[e] maist, O Veeky, Wha'rt posting the same road to Cleeky, Wha in a Clink Will up in Girdy's Cellar steek ye, Withouten Drink. Alake for him my Heart is wae, For he was ne'er a Poet's Fae, But did whatever in him lay, Our Warks to spread— For which his Fame shall last for ay, Tho' he be Dead.

I'm glad to see thee fraught with blest content. Thou lookst as thou some pleasing thought wouldst vent; Say, lovely friend, and give a reason why Ther's so much gladness dancing in thine eye. Coridon Yes, my dear Strephon, it's not without reason That I'm so blyth when ther's good occasion. Do not you know Menalcus, the brave swain That feeds his flocks on the adjacent plain? This day of shepherds none more happy is, For he's attained unto his long'd for bliss, A long'd for bliss which oft did rack his mind. But now the god of love, not always blind, Has unto his best wishes proven kind And granted him a bride as bright as day, Who will with pleasure all his cares allay. Strephon O sweet surprise! I know the happy youth— But who is she that will with softness soothe His easy cares and with her pleasing charms Clasp our dear friend within her snowy arms? Coridon With snow for whyteness they may well compare, And all her frame so delicate and rare. Her form all casten is in beauty's molds. Thousands of lambs are lodg'd within her folds. It's fair Melossa, who are fields did grace With modest air and with a charming face. Strephon I've seen the fair Melossa—happy he, If with her comely form her soul aggree! Such a fair lodging surely was design'd To harbor nothing but a virtuous mind. Coridon It was her bright virtue which did most commend Her to the love of our discerning friend— Thrice happy he, who hath the right to all In this wise nymph, which we can virtue call. Strephon Well he deserves her, and the gods are just To put so fair a jewell in his trust, Who knows to manage well what he intends. His solid fancy flys with nimble wings Through various tracts and to him knowledge brings— Knowledge, which teacheth us with a sweet voice What's bad, to shun; and what is good, to choice. Coridon Come, shepherd, rouse thee. This is not a day To loyter in; tune up thy pipe and play, And I will sing untill the rocks rebound And th'echo thirds us in our joyfull sound. The murmuring rivulet will be the bass While she o're little cattarchs runs her race, And the mild zephyr with his gentle breeze Will give a soft sound soughing through the trees, And on their tops or in the open sky Will sour and sing the little feathered fry. And let it be the subject of our theme To blaze Menalcus' and Melossa's fame. Strephon May the great Pan preserve their breeding flocks Of kine and sheep and goats that climb the rocks, Let no wolf enter on their verdant spot, And keep them free of all sickness and rot. Jove grant them plenty of[f]spring to survive, That on these plains their names may ever live And by such generous worth bear up their fame That ages after may still bless their name.

On The Dutches of Marlbrugh's offer of five hundred pounds to the poet that would make the best Elegy on the Duke. Five hundred pounds! to small a boon to put a Poet's muse in tune, That nothing may escape her, Should she atempt, the Heroick Story Of the Ilustrious Churchill's glory, it would not buy the paper! A.R. Annother Epigram or Epitaph on the above Subject [The Dutches of Marlbrugh's offer of five hundred pounds to the poet that would make the best Elegy on the Duke]. Here lyes the Ashes of a frame, that did a Soull Heroick hold, whose calm submissions to his Dame to future ages shall be told, Poor Sublaterns shall curse her name, as long as posts are bought &amp; sold, Now, Sarah, I the premium claim, take you these Lines, give me the Gold. Epitaph for His Grace the Duke of Marlbrugh. Here Lyes the Ashes of a frame which did the Soul of Churchill Hold The Boast of Britain whose great Name Shall be throw wondring ages told till time shall put ane end to fame in fame his Acts shall be enroll'd How he made Mighty Louis Tame With Conduct Wise &amp; Courage Bold. On the Royal Company of Scottish Archers. Who can with so much Envy be possest, Not frankly to rejoyce to see at last The Scottish Archers now again reviv'd; Whose martial Deeds can hardly be believ'd? These made great Rome her conquering Pride let fall, And here defend her Friends with Ditch and Wall. These with their Lives their Liberties maintain'd, And bravely kept their Honour still unstain'd, Thro' many Ages; to their Progeny Delivering down their Laws and Country free. Behold of pleasant Comrads now a Train, Join'd, not for Glory, nor the Hope of Gain: But whose approved Truth and Honesty, With a fix'd Purpose of Integrity, Makes all with sweetest Harmony t'agree. Who neither do their Friends in Straits forsake, Nor by envious Fame their Judgments make; Nor from Pursuit of what is just recede, For Pray'rs, or Threats, or Promise of good Deed. If in Defence of Albion's Liberty, The Rampant Lion shall be rais'd on high, Guarded with Armies of such Gallant Youth, Whose Breasts are arm'd with Courage and with Truth, Their Foes must quit the Field, or lose their Breath; Their pointed Arrows do give certain Death. On the Royal Company of Scottish Archers. Now Phoebus on our Fields doth early smile, And gloomy Night is banished our Isle Far South, beyond the long Capharian Bay, While ancient Thule enjoys a Month of Day, And Cattle on her lofty Hills do play, Till Mid-day Heat makes them to seek the Shade, Down in cool Glens, where they luxurious feed; And loyally drink down the Cristal Spring The Lion's Health, and own him for their King. Thrice happy Beasts! . . . The martial Genius of old Scotland moves Now in the Breasts of those who Glory loves, As in this Royal Squad of Youths, who dare, If call'd, imploy their Bows In Peace or War. If fierce Bellona sounds, they'll bend their Bows, And send a Shower of Deaths amongst their Foes; But in soft Peace, they then are Cupid's Care, And with his Shafts they gently wound the Fair. Sometimes to open Fields they do resort, To gain Diversion by their manly Sport. As the Olympian Games were first design'd To animate and raise the human Mind; So our chief Town a Silver Shaft bestows, For which the Archers yearly bend their Bows; Clade like those ancient Chiefs, who bravely stood Their Country's Fence to their last drop of Blood. An Habit which those Chieftains wore of old, Braver than those now spangled o'er with Gold: Still wore by them who are the purer Race Of those great Souls, who were our Country's Grace. The noble Weems, as Chieftain of the Band, Adds to his Glory more, than to command All great Britannia's Force by Sea or Land. Eugene nor Marlb'ro ne'r led such a Train, Thro' bloody Flanders to Ramillie's Plain. Such were the Grecian Chiefs who did encamp Before old Troy; not of the vulgar Stamp, But Men of Worth, a great and valiant Throng, Whose Minds were, like their Bodies, firm and strong. Your noble Nestor, ah! his Loss we mourn, Who now lies dormant in his silent Urn, Last Year upon your Head appear'd the Sage, Fraught with good Humour still, in Spite of Age. All Hearts were glad to see his Lordship gay, At such an Age such Vigour to display. But where's Achilles? Will he ne'r be seen, To head that merry Meeting on the Green? Now proud old Priam with his haughty Son Exulting fancies that the Field is won: Their joyful Acclamations rend the Skies; They swear by Jove, they'll keep the ravish'd Prize. Return Achilles ere it be too late, Clear up our Doubts, and stand the Shock of Fate. Let nothing damp the Courage of the Brave: In great Attempts, if just, the Gods will save. Jove in the Air the Scales of Fate doth hang: Thus spake Ulysses; thus old Homer sang. Thus shall my Muse, though on a weaker Wing, Fly to the End of Time, and ever sing Their Praise, who love their Country and their King. The Roundell to her Health A Health to M? O? And lang may she flurish But soon ye Gods a Gardner Grant that's fit to watter sic a Plant and Make the Maid a Nurish Now fill the Bumpers Drink and Rant A Health to M? O? and lang may she flurish Fable of the Lost Calf A Carefu' Cowherd anes had lost A Calf, that him much Seeking cost, His Labour vain, he near Despair, No Means untry'd save that of Prayer, The last Shift; when nought els will do, Then to the Gods at length we bow: Thus did our Herdsman, fill'd with Grief, Petition Jove to shew'm the Thief That with his Calf had run away, And he would on his Altar lay A Kid, the fattest of the Plain, Should for his Godship's Use be slain. His Prayer reach'd the high Abode. We hear thee, (smiling) cry'd the God, Have thy Desire.—Straight in the Place A Lion star'd him in the Face. The too rash Clown now shook with Fear, To see the awfu' Brute so near; Then to his Prayers he runs once more To unpray what he pray'd before: “Great Jove, said he, I know my Vow, “But the unhappy Wish I rew; “Remove the Thief, an't be thy Will, “And I shall make the Kid a Bull.” Thus Mankind oft importune Heaven For what would ruine them, if given. Epigram [When Nell in Tears frae Troy came] When Nell in Tears frae Troy came, Thus to her Cuckold spake the Dame: Tho Paris that young Lecher tall Enjoy'd my Body, you'ad my Saul. That I can well believe, quoth he; But Faith the warst haff fell to me. Another Epigram [A well kend Cuckold made his brag] A well kend Cuckold made his brag, How much by Fortune he was lov'd; And said in hearing of a Wag, That under him the Warld mov'd. That your great Glory yields to few, In Truth, says he, cannot be quarrel'd; For a' the Warld moves under you, And your Wife under a' the Warld. Another Epigram [Lasses, like Nuts, at Bottom brown] Lasses, like Nuts, at Bottom brown, Are ripe, and shou'd be sought; Else of themsells they will fa' down, And syn prove good for Nought. Songs from The Devil of a Duke or Trappolin's Vagaries (1733). Song 1. [I have a soft spirit &amp; do what I dou] I have a soft spirit &amp; do what I dou Dear Trapolin will have the guiding o't While he talks &amp; he smiles my hearts in a low and now ther is no longer hiding o't he hugs me &amp; Jugs me and calls me his sweet he ralles &amp; Raves while he falls at my feet by his constant adress his love seems complete yet still I'm afraid of the abiding o't Song 2. What should a Lassie do with an old man. Flametta O shoud Wanton fancy move you Shoud you prove a naughty man I shall think you never lov'd me I shall hate you if I can Trap. Shoud your charming Beauty move me 'twoud but prove that I'm a man you shoud believe I better lovd you try, then hate me if you can Song 3. Willy was a wanton wag. Would you be the man in fashion and prove wealthy safe &amp; wise indulge yourself in every passion virtue learning fame despise be rapacious bold &amp; florid Gold alone is the great prize that takes from vices all that're horid and makes us pass for good &amp; wise This clears a reputation tarnish'd and it never yet was found that the Gallows eer was garnished with a hundred thousand pound Song 4. The Lads of Dunse. Complying denying now free &amp; now coy Alluring &amp; curing Loves pain with it(s) Joy with frowns or with smiles that kindle a fire is a Lass that each Temper &amp; age must admire her Eye darts its glances our heart feels its Ray her power advances as ours ebbs away from charms so strong ther's none can retreat for do what she will she is every way sweet Song 5. [A buxom young daughter] A buxom young daughter makes many mouths water and the fops all around her will spark it they say 'tis a Treasure but gives us no pleasure Untill they are Brought to fair market while our cash is in chest we are never at rest for Robes are every where loose Sir our Girls &amp; our purses are nothing but curses 'till they both are put out to good use Sir Song 6. O'r Boggy. The dog his Bit will often Quit a Bulle to eschewe The cock his corn will leave in Barn annother cock in view one man will eat annothers meat and no contention seen for all agree 'tis good to be tho' hungry in a whole skin But should each spy his mistress by one contradict his suit he Quits al fears &amp; by the Ears they fall together to't Such Hinderers shocks mend Dogs &amp; Cocks and makes the gentle froward He who wont fight for Mistress bright in something worse than coward Song 7. Colin's Complaint. As the Bark when it parts from the shore has scarce any distance between yet at last by the Billows 'tis bore where, alas! no more land's to be seen So from virtue when once we remove we attempt to return, but in vain by the current of vice we are drove 'till we founder at length in the main. Song 8. What tho' they call me a Country Lass. Now that I'm Duke I'll strut right high come courtiers flatter fawn &amp; ly what are the greatest more than I but a stand by clear the way and since so kindly is my fate With this new face I'll put on state and some shall fall as I grow great I pant to see the day Song 9. My Deary, if thou die. Pure as the new falen snow apears the spotles virgins name unsullyd white her bosom bears as fair her form &amp; frame but when she's soild her luster greets the admiring Eye no more she sinks to mud defiles the streets and swells the common shore. Song 10. John Anderson my Jo. A statesman should employ his art to increase his master's wealth and study to rejoyce his heart with pleasures cround with health nor should he pillage from the croun t'enrich himself or Heirs or raise himself by pulling down old brave descended peers he ought to gain royall reward for such as well deserve and ever have a stayd regard neer to let Merit starve. Song 11. My Dady forbad. such hang dogs of state they swell up so great by pimping by flattery &amp; lying that the crafty vile Rooks make a blind of their Dukes while their favours they are selling &amp; Buying but wee'll let them know wee'll not be led so as we please we will smile or wee'll frown Boy we Tuscany's Duke on no man will look with any ones Eyes but our own Boy. Song 12. Hap me with thy Petticoat. Loves the young Heroe victory and pamperd priests young nuns do good men joy in clemency and Willings in their punns do poets take delight in praise The Beau in Laces clean so lov'd I and will all my Days Poor banishd Trapolin. Song 13. Yellow hair'd Laddie. Some charm with their Descent and some with their face Some inchant with a Manner &amp; some with a Grace Some only wish Riches to engage them for Life while others value nothing but wit in a wife But in my dear choice all excellencys shine and point her out sprung from a source thats divine Tho ane Enemie captive I viewed your desert which darted a conquest on my yielding heart and now without Blushing I own you my choice since a Brother consenting gives cause to rejoyce and since my heart vanquished no longer is mine accept on and cherisht as I will do thine. Song 14. Nansy to the Greenwood gane. Now all's restored to rights again and falshood is discarded Let sounding Joys ring oer the plain and virtue be rewarded when cross events in life appear that wrap in clouds their meaning they give us pain but when they clear they then are entertaining since I'm no more a Duke can be farewell to all thats stately Come Flammie then let thee &amp; me strive to live kind &amp; quietly if we enjoy content &amp; love and tho our rents be scanty our real joys may rise above the petts of pride &amp; plenty Song 15. [would ye be a man of fame] would ye be a man of fame and rise to courtly station then be a pimp the noble name will aid your elevation soldiers may fight &amp; Gamblers bite and poets write their sence out But pimps with ease their patrons can please and best can make the pence out Then fa a dri didle Still at our devotion if from our Grace youd hope a place by pimping comes promotion The merry meeting on The Moor July 1749 Now tours the Sun with radiant glow and zyphers brush the Height and How, neigher the Steads, the Spaniels frisk, the Hunters mount with humour brisk, to range the Moor, &amp; beat the Bent, and bring down Powts, with fell intent Three Knights advance into the field wha to nae fae a foot wad yield, tho born upon the Dragon's wing, or arm'd with th'envemon'd sting, attended by their trusty 'Squires, and Nymphs in palfreys, and in Carrs, who unaffraid can Deserts trace, and look all dangers in the face, the Mossy Hag, the Birns, and Bogg, the Tempests while the Forrests shogg, and all such draw-backs, are in vain when they've a mind to take the plain, unlike the Lazy city Fair who downa thole the halesom air, Now as the chearfu' menzie wheel outo'er the wild, to gain the Sheil, where Sportsmen their tire'd limbs recline, and like auld Grecean Heroes dine, accross their way, by Sathan sent, a Serpent crawld out from the Bent, uncoild it self, and forward sprung, Hissing with venomd teeth &amp; Tongue, doun from his Carr the Guardian Knight with Martial Ardour did alight, the Nymphs from dangers to relieve, by crushing that auld fae of Eve, which he perform'd with as stout Arm a as Hercules slew that of Lerna, which he with a great Club destroy'd our Errant but a Whip imployd, with which the Sneak he breathless laid Scorning to' file his shining blade with blood impure,—and now again they mount, and scowre allong the plain, singing a conquest sae compleat, While Ecchoing Hills the notes repeat. Far in the uncultivated waste, by good Sir John, a Bower is placed The Architecture, all designed of the exactest rustick kind, and sae well form'd, above and under, beyond the pith of Thieves to plunder, nor cormorants, wha fleece by acts, can make it pay the Window Tax, There feasted we, with much delyte, nae sauce like a keen appitite, and blest be clever Calderwood wha cookd us up the savoury food, such was the dish Rebecca dress'd for which, auld Isaac, Jacob blesd The Tribes wha were by Moses led whase Tables were in Desarts spred, from the red sea, to Jordans ford, never beheld a rougher Board, or crownd with mair substantial dishes to gratifie the sharpest wishes, than we sat round, nor easyer flowd good humour, in the Age of Gowd, when sullen Jar, &amp; party strife, coost nae dark Shades on social life nor was there wanting as good liquour as ever ratle'd in a Bicquour, which all might drink, as they incline of ale, or watter, punch, or wine, nor must the Bon-bouch be unsung which phenix like frae Ashes sprung, well pepperd with the salt of peat, the gusty Morsell close'd the Treat, and chearfully ilk waggan chin fill'd up all blanks that were within, while freedom prompt the Jovial Jest, and finish'd out the Rurall Feast A. R. On false Greatness 1 Stand aff ye giddy, gawky, thrang, to what-e'er classes ye belang, frae Cottars up to King's if you'r of Truth &amp; Justice scant and Social lore, &amp; honour want, ye are but worthless Things. 2 Tho to ten Thousand Acres born all wavend with Crops of golden corn, and slaves to bow before ye if you are selfish, proud, and sour, of humour fickle, dull, &amp; dour nane will in heart care for ye. 3 wha can help laughing in their faces! that are maist fausly call'd their Graces, wha're reverse of the Title, heap honours upon honour's top, it ne'er will make the matter up, if that the Saul be litle. 4 full blest are they wha claim their birth frae great forbears of valued worth and imitate their merit they'll still engage the world's esteem wha muddy not the flowing stream with an Ignoble Spirit. Penk August 29th 1755 A LXXI R An Exchange of Epistles About the moneth, sir, of September When you wer here, I do remember I promised to write my mind. Indeed, good sir, you were not kind. Coldness in age is a great failing— I match you there, but am not willing That all the love from me shoud come; This is a thing that's seldom done. Least I be guilty of false charge, Express your love by gifts that's large— A diamond ring or a gold chain Will ty me always to remain To be your jo as herefore, But tys of priests can scarce get o'er. Yet bonny wallys in my time Hath caught young lasses in their prime, And realy you must owe such charms For auld folks turn oftimes bairns. His Answer Dear Lady Gay, grant me I am auld, Yet am I neither faild nor cauld; And tho I wer a score of years Aulder than you, we'r head-a-pears, For I'm for generation stout Lang time after your pipe's gane out. I own indeed when kirtle woos It spaes baith speed and luck to trews, But gowden chains and diamond rings Upon my troth are costly things To gie a mistress in propine Wha winna cast the knot divine. In ae respect I'le serve ye brawly With what maid loo, a bonny wally; But gin ye ergh to be my wife And hazard take of me for life, The complement ye's never thumb But for as mickle in its room.

POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO RAMSAY Lines writ on seeing Boys act the Tragedy of Cato in the Taylors' Hall, March 16, 1742. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Courant: March 29 Hail, Cato! lovely youth, how didst thou shine With graces borrow'd from the Roman line! Thou set the godlike father up to view, Pointing the virtues Britons should pursue. The rising Cato made our hearts to glow With generous pleasure and condoling wo. When firm he stood, how venerably great, Beneath his sufferings, and resign'd to fate! Like an old oak that glories in his height, Midst storms and tempests standing still upright. What bosom swell'd not with a sacred joy, To see great Portius in the tender Boy? The true resemblance of his glorious sire, Possess'd of virtues which all men admire: His speech, his action, every thing confess'd, The hero's sould lodged in the stripling's breast. Marcius conspicuous shone, throughout the whole, With Roman virtues and a Roman soul. How well did Syphax act the treacherous part! A Syphax in appearance, not in heart. Lucius, mid'st civil broils calm and serene; Unchanged, though fortune pleased to change the scene; Which gives us hopes our Lucius, when of age, Will act his part in life, as on the stage. No sooner Lucia lent her friendly aid, Than all resistless were her captives made; Teaching the fair to listen to desert, And banish fops and coxcombs from the heart. How Marcia charm'd, when beautifully grieved, By Lybian robes stain'd o'er with blood deceived! Her secret passion now no more conceals, Throws off restraint, and owns the flame she feels. The little Decius, too, deserves our praise, Wh' address'd the senate with becoming grace; The just applauses of the audience won. Express'd by claps on claps from every one. Ye British youth! advance to mighty deeds, Storing your tender mind with all the seeds Of solid virtue, which will brave your fate, And, tho, depress'd, will ever make you great. The Thimble The attribution of this poem is questionable. “In tenui labour: at tenuis non gloria.” —Virg. What god shall I invoke to raise my song? What goddess I of the celestial throng? Shall bright Apollo lend to me his aid? Shall chaste Lucina bring my muse to bed? Oh! rather, greatest beauty of the sky! I write for Lydia; hear your vot'ry's cry, You gave your charms to her—What can you then deny? All o'er this globe, where Phoebus darts his rays, What strange variety accosts our eyes! We see how nations variously incline, How different studies favour different men; Some love to chase the fox throughout the day, Others to dance the winter night away, Unlike to these, some love the trumpet's sound, And cries of men, when gasping on the ground; To some, of fancy warm it gives delight, Instructed by the muses, verse to write Of bards, some generals in fight rehearse, Others with groves and fountains crowd their verse. Greater than their's has fallen to my share— A theme sublimer far demands my care, I sing the thimble—armour of the fair. Hail! heaven-invented-engine! gift divine! You keep the tend'rest fingers free from pain. Sing, lofty Muse, from whence the Thimble sprung— The Thimble—safeguard of the fair and young. In ancient times, ere mortals learnt the trade, Bright Venus for herself her mantles made. As busied once, in Cyprian grove she sat, Her turtles fondly sleeping at her feet, With hands alone to sew the goddess tried, Her wand'ring thoughts were otherwise employed; When,—lo! her needle—strange effect of spite— Wounded that skin it could not see so bright; She starts,—she raves,—she trembles with the smart; The point that pricked her skin, went to her heart. Sharp pain would not allow her long to stop; “My doves,” she cry'd, “haste to Olympus' top” The tim'rous beauty gets into her car, Her pinioned bearers swiftly cut the air. As quick as thought, they reach'd the sacred ground, Where mighty Jove with Juno sat enthron'd. “What ails my child?” to her then cried the god; “Why thus in tears? What makes you look so odd? Would you a favour beg?”—A while she stood, Her ivory finger stain'd with purple blood; Then thus:—“Oh! father of the gods,” she prayed, “Grant I may be invulnerable made!” With look sedate, returned the awful sire— “Daughter, you do not know what you desire; Would you to Pluto's gloomy regions run? Would you be dipt in Styx, like Thetis 'son? Could you unfrighted view Hell's dismal shore? What shall I say then?—Go, and stitch no more.” Ashamed—unsatisfied—away she hies To try her fate again, beneath the skies. “Shall I,” she said, “While goddesses well drest, Outshine each other at a birthday feast— Shall I in simple nakedness be brought, Or clothed in rags? Intolerable thought! No, rather may the blood my cheeks forsake, And a new passage thro' my fingers take!” In fertile Sicily, well known to fame, A mountain stands, and Ætna is its name.— Tremendous earthquakes rend the flinty rock, And vomit forth continual fire and smoke: Here, Vulcan forges thunderbolts for Jove, Here, frame sharp arrows for the God of Love; His Cyclops with their hammers strike around, The hollow caverns echo back the sound. Here, Venus brought her pigeons and her coach, The one-eyed workman ceased at her approach; When Vulcan thus:—“My charmer! why so pale? You seem prepared to tell some dismal tale. Does fierce Tydides still his rage pursue? Or has your son his arrows tried on you?” “Ah! no!”—“What makes you bleed then? answer quick.” “Oh no, my lord, my husband! Know a prick Of needle's point has made me wond'rous sick.” “Fear not, my spouse!” said Vulcan, “ne'er again, Never shall any needle give you pain.” With that the charming goddess he embraced, Then in a shell of brass her finger cased. “This little engine shall in future days” Continued he, “receive the poet's praise, And give a fruitful subject for their lays; This shall the lovely Lydia's finger grace— Lydia—the fairest of the human race!” He spoke—then, with a smile, the Queen of Love Returned him thanks, and back to Cyprus drove. When Venus, Lydia, with beauty blest, She granted her the thimble with the rest; Yet cannot brass or steel remain for aye— All earthly things are subject to decay. Of Babel's tow'r, so lofty and so proud, No stone remains to tell us where it stood: The great, the wise, the valiant and the just, Caesar and Cato, are returned to dust; Devouring Time to all destruction brings, Alike the fate of Thimbles—and of Kings. Then grieve not, Lydia! cease your anxious care, Nor murmur lest your favorite Thimble wear. All other thimbles shall wear out e'er long, All other thimbles, be they e'er so strong, Whilst your's shall live for ever in my song. On the foregoing by ? Fair Lydia's Thimble, Ramsay! to thy name, Shall be a passport thro' the gates of Fame. To the Memory of Alexr Strachan sometime School master in Pennycuik who died aged 80 years 1733. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Beneath this stone old Strachan's laid whose Looks made Belzebub affraid he quick as lightning fled before him lest with his Taz he had come o'er him In Pennycuik strict was his rule where long he kept his awful school where with these Taz &amp; canker'd looks he gart young Scholars tent their Books when he appeared in Blood-red Gown Then trembled all the Bairns in Town Soon as he reached the Stygian lake even rugged Charon 'gan to quake his wonted freight he asked not but freely put him in his Boat he had no will to run the Risque of getting with the Taz a whisk thus Sanders he got safely in without a scart upon his skin And soon as Cerberus saw the Carle He hid his heads and durst not snarl nor from him usual loaf he Beggs but fled with's Tail between his Leggs Hells monsters all before him fled and soon he gain'd the Elesian shade Howere these things the Poets feign let Strachan's Bones in rest remain His Scholar keen to recompence his master's Care &amp; Diligence Erects this Tomb that so his name May flurish with a lasting fame Hardyknute, A Fragment. I Stately stept he East the Wa, And stately stept he West, Full Seventy Zeirs he now had sene, With skerss sevin Zeirs of Rest. He livit quhen Britons Breach of Faith Wroucht Scotland meikle Wae: And ay his Sword tauld to their Cost, He was their deidly Fae. II Hie on a Hill his Castle stude, With Halls and Touris a Hicht, And guidly Chambers fair to se, Quhair he lodgit mony a Knicht. His Dame sae peirless anes and fair, For Chast and Bewtie deimt, Nae Marrow had in all the Land, Saif Elenor the Quene. III Full Thirtein Sons to him scho bare, All Men of Valour stout; In bluidy Ficht with Sword in Hand Nyne lost their Lives bot doubt; Four zit remain, lang may they live To stand by Liege and Land: Hie was their Fame, hie was their Micht, And hie was their Command. IV Great Luve they bare to Fairly fair, Their Sister saft and deir, Her Girdle shawd her Middle gimp, And gowden glist her Hair. Quhat waefou wae hir Bewtie bred? Waefou to zung and auld, Waefou I trow to Kyth and Kin, As Story ever tauld. V The King of Norse in Summer Tyde, Puft up with Powir and Micht, Landed in fair Scotland the Yle, With mony a hardy Knicht: The Tydings to our gude Scots King Came, as he sat at Dyne, With noble Chiefs in braif Aray, Drinking the Blude-reid Wyne. VI “To Horse, to Horse, my Ryal Liege, “Zour Faes stand on the Strand, “Full Twenty thousand glittering Spears “The King of Norse commands. Bring me my Steed Mage dapple gray, Our gude King raise and cryd, A trustier Beast in all the Land A Scots King nevir seyd. VII GO, little Page, tell Hardyknute, That lives on Hill so hie, To draw his Sword, the Dreid of Faes, And haste and follow me. The little Page flew swift as Dart Flung by his Masters Arm, Cum down, cum down, Lord Hardyknute, And rid zour King frae Harm. VIII Then reid, reid grew his dark-brown Cheiks, Sae did his dark-brown Brow; His Luiks grew kene, as they were wont, In Dangers great to do; He hes tane a Horn as grene as Glass, And gien five Sounds sae shrill, That Treis in grene Wod schuke thereat, Sae loud rang ilka Hill. IX His Sons in manly Sport and Glie, Had past that Summers Morn, Quhen lo down in a grassy Dale, They heard their Fatheris Horn. That Horn, quod they, neir sounds in Peace, We haif other Sport to byde; And sune they heyd them up the Hill, And sune were at his Syde. X LATE late Zestrene I weind in Peace To end my lengthned Lyfe, My Age micht weil excuse my Arm Frae manly Feats of Stryfe; But now that Norse dois proudly boast Fair Scotland to inthrall, Its neir be said of Hardyknute, He feard to ficht or fall. XI ROBIN of Rothsay bend thy Bow, Thy Arrows schute sae leil, Mony a comely Countenance They haif turnd to deidly Pale: Brade Thomas tak ze but zour Lance, Ze neid nae Weapons mair, Gif ze ficht weit as ze did anes Gainst Westmorlands ferss Heir. XII MALCOLM, licht of Fute as Stag That runs in Forest wyld, Get me my Thousands Thrie of Men Well bred to Sword and Schield: Bring me my Horse and Harnisine, My Blade of Mettal cleir. If Faes kend but the Hand it bare, They sune had fled for Feir. XIII FAREWEIL my Dame sae peirless gude, And tuke hir by the Hand, Fairer to me in Age zou seim, Than Maids for Bewtie famd: My zoungest Son sall here remain To guard these stately Towirs, And shut the Silver Bolt that keips, Sae fast zour painted Bowirs. XIV And first scho wet hir comely Cheiks, And then hir Boddice grene, Hir Silken Cords of Twirtle twist, Weil plett with Silver schene; And Apron set with mony a Dice Of Neidle-wark sae rare, Wove by nae Hand, as ze may guess, Saif that of Fairly fair. XV And he has ridden owre Muir and Moss, Owre Hills and mony a Glen, Quhen he came to a wounded Knicht Making a heavy Mane; Here maun I lye, here maun I dye, By Treacheries false Gyles; Witless I was that eir gaif Faith To wicked Womans Smyles. XVI SR Knicht, gin ze were in my Bowir, To lean on Silken Seat, My Ladyis kyndlie Care zoud prove, Quha neir kend deidly Hate; Hir self wald watch ze all the Day, Hir Maids a deid of Nicht; And Fairly fair zour Heart wald cheir, As scho stands in zour Sicht. XVII ARYSE, zoung Knicht, and mount zour Steid, Full lowns the schynand Day, Cheis frae my Menzie quhom ze pleis To leid ze on the Way. With smyless Luke and Visage wan, The wounded Knicht replyd, Kynd Chiftain, zour Intent pursue, For heir I maun abyde. XVIII To me nae after Day nor Nicht, Can eir be sweit or fair, But sune beneath sum draping Trie, Cauld Deith sall end my Care. With him nae Pleiding micht prevail, Braif Hardyknute to gain, With fairest Words and Reason strang, Straif courteously in vain. XIX Syne he has gane far hynd attowre, Lord Chattans Land sae wyde, That Lord a worthy Wicht was ay, Quhen Faes his Courage jeyd: Of Pictish Race by Mothers Syde, Quhen Picts ruld Caledon, Lord Chattan claimd the Princely Maid, Quhen he saift Pictish Crown. XX Now with his ferss and stalwart Train, He reicht a rysing Heicht, Quhair braid encampit on the Dale, Norss Army lay in Sicht; Zonder my valziant Sons and feris, Our raging Revers wait, On the unconquerit Scottish Swaird To try with us thair Fate. XXI MAK Orisons to him that saift Our Sauls upon the Rude, Syne braifly schaw zour Veins ar filld With Caledonian Blude. Then furth he drew his trusty Glaive, Quhyle Thousands all arround, Drawn frae their Sheaths glanst in the Sun, And loud the Bougills sound. XXII To join his King adoun the Hill In Hast his Merch he made, Quhyle, playand Pibrochs, Minstralls meit Afore him stately strade. Thryse welcum valziant Stoup of Weir, Thy Nations Scheild and Pryde; Thy King nae Reason has to feir Quhen thou art be his Syde. XXIII Quhen Bows were bent and Darts were thrawn, For thrang scarce could they flie, The Darts clove Arrows as they met, The Arrows dart the Trie. Lang did they rage and ficht full ferss, With little Skaith to Man, But bludy, bludy was the Field, Or that lang Day was done. XXIV The King of Scots that sindle bruikd The War that luikt lyke Play, Drew his braid Sword, and brake his Bow, Sen Bows seimt but Delay: Quoth noble Rothsay, Myne I'll keip, I wate its bleid a Skore. Hast up my merry Men, cryd the King, As he rade on before. XXV The King of Norse he socht to find, With him to mense the Faucht, But on his Forehead there did licht A sharp unsonsie Shaft; As he his Hand put up to find The Wound, an Arrow kene, O waefou Chance! there pinnd his Hand In midst betwene his Ene. XXVI REVENGE, revenge, cryd Rothsays Heir, Your Mail-coat sall nocht byde The Strength and Sharpness of my Dart; Then sent it throuch his Syde: Another Arrow weil he markd, It persit his Neck in twa, His Hands then quat the silver Reins, He law as Eard did fa. XXVII SAIR bleids my Liege, sair, sair he bleids. Again with micht he drew And Gesture dreid his sturdy Bow, Fast the braid Arrow flew: Wae to the Knicht he ettled at, Lament now Quene Elgreid, Hie Dames to wail zour Darlings Fall, His Zouth and comely Meid. XXVIII TAKE aff, take aff his costly Jupe (Of Gold weil was it twynd, Knit lyke the Fowlers Net throuch quhilk His steilly Harness shynd) Take, Norse, that Gift frae me, and bid Him venge the Blude it beirs; Say, if he face my bended Bow, He sure nae Weapon feirs. XXIX Proud Norse with Giant Body tall, Braid Shoulder and Arms strong, Cryd, Quhair, is Hardyknute sae famd And feird at Britains Throne: Tho Britons tremble at his Name, I sune sall make him wail, That eir my Sword was made sae sharp, Sae saft his Coat of Mail. XXX That Brag his stout Heart coud na byde, It lent him zouthfou Micht: I'm Hardyknute this Day, he cryd, To Scotlands King I hecht, To lay thee law as Horses Hufe, My Word I mean to keip. Syne with the first Strake eir he strake, He garrd his Body bleid. XXXI NORSE ene lyke gray Gosehawks staird wyld, He sicht with Shame and Spyte; Disgracd is now my far famd Arm, That left thee Power to stryke: Then gaif his Head a Blaw fae fell, It made him doun to stoup, As law as he to Ladies usit In courtly Gyse to lout. XXXII Full sune he rais'd his bent Body, His Bow he marvelld fair, Sen Blaws till then on him but darrd As Touch of Fairly fair: Norse ferliet too as fair as he To se his stately Luke, Sae sune as eir he strake a Fae, Sae sune his Lyfe he tuke. XXXIII Quhair lyke a Fyre to Hether fet, Bauld Thomas did advance, A sturdy Fae with Luke enragd Up towards him did prance; He spurd his Steid throw thickest Ranks The hardy Zouth to quell Quha stude unmufit at his Approach His Furie to repell. XXXIV THAT schort brown Shaft sae meanly trimd, Lukis lyke poor Scotlands Geir, But dreidfull seims the rusty Poynt! And loud he leuch in Jeir. Aft Britains Blude has dimd its Shyne This Poynt cut short their Vaunt; Syne piercd the boisteris bairded Cheik, Nae Tyme he tuke to taunt. XXXV Schort quhyle he in his Sadill swang, His Stirrip was nae Stay, Sae feible hang his unbent Knee, Sure taken he was fey: Swith on the hardened Clay he fell, Richt far was hard the Thud, But Thomas luikt not as he lay All waltering in his Blude. XXXVI With cairles Gesture Mynd unmuvit On raid he north the Plain, His feim in Thrang of fiercest Stryfe, Quhen Winner ay the fame; Nor zit his Heart Dames dimpelit Cheik, Coud meife saft Luve to bruik, Till vengeful Ann returnd his Scorn, Then languid grew his Luke. XXXVII In Thrawis of Death, with wallowit Cheik All panting on the Plain, The fainting Corps of Warriours lay, Neir to aryse again; Neir to return to native Land, Nae mair with blythsom Sounds, To boist the Glories of the Day, And schaw thair Shyning Wounds. XXXVIII On Norways Coast the Widowit Dame May wash the Rocks with Teirs, May lang luke owre the Schiples Seis Befoir hir Mate appeirs. Ceife, Emma, ceife to hope in Vain, Thy Lord lyis in the Clay, The valziant Scots nae Revers thole To carry Lyfe away. XXXIX There on a Lie quhair stands a Cross Set up for Monument, Thousands full fierce that Summers Day Filld kene Waris black Intent, Lets Scots, quhyle Scots, praife Hardyknute, Let Norse the Name ay dreid, Ay how he faucht, aft how he spaird, Sal latest Ages reid. XL Loud and chill blew the westlin Wind, Sair beat the heavy Showir, Mirk grew the Nicht eir Hardyknute Wan neir his stately Tower, His Towir that usd with Torches bleise To shyne sae far at Nicht, Seimd now as black as mourning Weid, Nae Marvel sair he sichd. XLI THAIRS nae Licht in my Ladys Bowir Thairs nae Licht in my Hall; Nae Blink shynes round my Fairly fair, Nor Ward stands on my Wall. Quhat bodes it? Robert, Thomas say, Nae Answer fits their Dreid. Stand back, my Sons, I'll be zour Gyde, But by they past with Speid. XLII AS fast I haif sped owre Scotlands Faes, There ceist his Brag of Weir, Sair schamit to mynd ocht but his Dame, And Maiden Fairly fair. Black Feir he felt, but quhat to feir He wist not zit with Dreid; Sair schuke his Body, sair his Limbs, And all the Warrior fled.</field>
