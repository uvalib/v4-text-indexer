Siþen com vaspasians and was furst sped, In þe nome of þe fader Ioseph him folewede, And hedde I-turned to þe feyþ fifti with him-seluen. Siþen he fette his fader with a ferde and a-?eyn fondet, þer þei bosked hem out þat hudden hem in huirenes, Made hem to huppe half an hundret foote, forte seche boþem þer þei non sei?en. þus þei ladden þe lyf and lengede longe, þat luyte liked his leyk þer as he lengede. Feole flowen for fert out of heore cuþþhe in-to Augrippus lond was heroudes eir, þere monye lenginde weore for-let of heore oune. Þen com a vois to Ioseph and seide him þise wordes, Biddes him and his wyf and his sone eke, And alle þat þey mou?ten gete and to god tornen, Gon out of Ierusalem &amp; prechen hise wordes, And neuer more come a-?eyn whon þei weore enes þenne. In þe morwe he was sone boun don as he biddes; Ioseph and his cumpanye keueren on swiþe.

A-morwe þei weore di?t and don hem to ?onge, And come to a Forest with floures ful feire, þat was called Argos þat þe kyng ou?te, in þe lond of damas þe cuntre was dere. Þenne spekes a vois to Ioseph was Ihesu crist himselue, “Iosep[h], marke on þe treo and make a luytel whucche, Forte do in þat ilke blod þou berest a-boute; whon þe lust speke with me lift þe lide sone, þou schalt fynde me redi ri?t bi þi syde, And, bote þou and þi sone me no mon touche.

Þei ferden to A Cite faste bi-syde, þat was called sarras þer sarsyns sprongen, Erest þorw Abrahames wyf þat wonede þer-inne. Ioseph tei? to non hous bote euene to þe temple: He sei? þe kyng þer he sat and wuste þat he was wraþþed, &amp; hopede he scholde him touward God turne; For he and þo of Egipte han werret to-gedere, And þei discounfitede him han and scaþet ful ofte. þe kyng and his Baronage a counseil bi-gonnen; he wolde haue red of his folk and fare to hem ?itte; &amp; þei forsaken hit han &amp; he vnsauht sittes. “Sire,” seis Iosep[h] “or semblaunt is feble, In gret Anguisse ?e ben þat nis not God greiþe; wolde ?e herkene to me icholde ow bi-heete, He þat is mi foundeor may hit folfulle, þat was ded on þe cros &amp; bou?te us so deore; I am not worþi to seyn moni of his werkes.” “þou schewest A symple skil,” quaþ þe kyng “ofscutered þou semest to speke of A ded mon what may he don þer-ate?” “I schal sei ou,” quod Ioseph “&amp; ?e wol vndurstonde.” “tel on,” seis þe kyng “þi tale wol I here.” “Þat tyme þat Augustus Cesar was Emperour of Rome, þis reson bi-gon þat I schal now rikenen, whon god sende an Angel in-to Galile, to A Cite, bi nome Nazareth I-called, to A Maiden ful meke þat Marie was hoten, And seide, ‘Blessed beo þou flour feirest of alle! þe holigost with-Inne þe schal lenden and lihte; þou schalt beren a Child schal Ihesu bi hoten.’ he chaungede cher &amp; seide ‘hou scholde I gon with childe with-oute felauschupe of mon?’ he bad hire not demayen; ‘þou schalt be mayden for him bi-foren, and after.

Whon he wolde ben I-boren at a Blisful tyme, he dude Miracles feole þat mony men sei?en; þre kynges of þe Est þroly þei comen, And vche put him in hond [a] present ful riche.

And þou seist now he has on hou may þis sitte same?” “He was Fader,” quod Ioseph “and for his sake called, þat was gostliche his halt ar he weore mon formed; And of two persones sprong out þe þridde; þat was þe holigost as I be-foren seide. His godhede lees he nou?t þei? he come lowe, þat he nas god ay forþ in his grete strengþe.

Now we leuen Ioseph and of þe kyng carpen; As he lai at niht keuered in bedde, In þreo þou?tes he was and þat weore þis ilke: On for his grete folk þat him wiþ-saken hedde; A-noþur for Iosep[h]s tale þat wolde fayn he tornede; þe þridde, How God scholde wiþ-outen wem wonen in a Mayden. Þenne he seih in his chaumbre-flor þreo souht vp at enes. þe braunches on hei? weoren alle of o lengþe; Bote þe bark of þat on semede dimmore þen ouþer of þe oþer two trouwe þou forsoþe; þat signede Ihesu crist for sake of vre kuynde, was nout out-wiþ so cler bote wiþ-inne he was clene. He calles on his chaumberleyn to kennen vncouþes, And he rises a-non and for ferd falles. And he feres him vp and bad him not ben ferd; “þer schal falle non euel of þat is here formed.” þei lihten two torches and to þis treos wenten; þei weore semeli bi-neoþe þei mihte not seo þe hei?þe, sprongen wiþ gret sped of a good spice. On vche braunche was a word of þreo maner enkes; Gold and Seluer he seis and Asur forsoþe. “‘þis makeþ,’” quod þe wiht “þe marke of gold;” “And ‘þis saues,’” quaþ þat wiht “þe seyne of seluer; And ‘þis clanses’ as þe Asur kennes.” þe kyng nuste wel forte seye bi wit þat he hedde, wheþer þat he se?e was on forte sigge, oþer two, or þreo or what he mi?te telle. þe kyng was a-bascht and to his bed buskes; and his Chaumberleyn so a-ferd þat neih he felde Iswowen. þenne he sei? a newe chaumbre-wouh wrou?t al of bordes, a dore honginge þer-on haspet ful faste, A child cominge þorw his come was nout seene, Siþen lenges a while and a-?ein lendes, wiþ-outen faute oþer faus as þei fore seiden. þenne spekes a vois and on hei? sigges, “king, haue þou no ferli of þat is heere formed, for so god with-outen wem wende in a Mayden.” Now we leuen þe kyng and of Ioseph carpen; “A! lord!” quaþ Ioseph “how may þis limpe Of þis king Eualak þat con not vnderstonde? Bote ?if I turne him bi þis poynt ar he henne passe, beos he neuermore I-tornd treweli I trouwe. Nou I be-seche þe, Ihesu as þou art ful of Ioye, þat speke to hem of Israel þorw Moyses speche, And bad þei schulde leeuen for no-skunus þinge, In non oþur straunge god bote studefast þe holde: And wustest daniel in þe put þat he was inne I-worpe Among þe leones feole þat he no scaþe lau?te: And for-?af þe Maudeleyn mekelyche hire sunnes: And siþen seidest to me mi preyere scholde sitte; þou hei?test holichurche to haunsen hire strengþe, to hi?en þi godhed hit helpes nout elles; Nou, gloriouse kyng graunte me mi boone.” Þenne spekes a vois and on hei? sigges, “Ioseph, haue þou no care þe kyng schal sone torne: Go þou most to þi wyf gete þou most nede A child, Galaad schal be hoten þat goodnesse schal reise þe Auenturus of Brutayne to haunsen and to holden.” And he dos as he bad and to his bed buskes. In þe morwe he was vppe and roises þis oþure. þenne hit þester bi-gon and þonderde swiþe, þat þe graue quakede and þei a-grisen alle. He bi-þenkes him þo and to his whucche weendes, And feole preiers he made þat Ihesu crist herde, And spekes to hem wiþ loueliche wordes. “I-blesset be ?e to day alle myne leoue children”— And he tolde hem of his crucifiing hou he [þe] cros sou?te, And of heore fadres bi-fore þat he fond vn-kuynde— “Er þei speeken to me feire and faynede me wiþ wordes, Bote þei hateden me and hedden de-deyn.

Þenne vp sturten þe folk and wolden wiþ wepene sle Iosep[h] and his sone for sake of þis oþer; And þe kyng Eualac cau?te his swerd sone, And beo þe miht of Iubiter he swor to hem alle, weore eny of heom so wood heom forte founde, he wolde felle hem feye ar þei þenne ferden. þenne seis þe kyng “mai þer out me helpe forto saue me out ?if þat hit so lym[p]e?” “?e, sire,” seis Iosaphe “to fonge þe trouþe.” “And what trouwest þou of þis mon tides him hele?” “Gos to oure Maumetes and proues heore mihtes.” þenne þei taken þis mon and towen him to þe temple, A-non þei brou?ten him forþ bi-foren þe moste mayster, Calleþ vppon an ymage þat Appollin hette, and wol not onswere a word þauh þei scholde swelten. þenne spekes an ymage in a-noþer huirne, þat ?e clepeþ Martis “nou?t is þat ?e mene; Appolin is bounden and braset so faste, he may not speke a word for no þing alyue.” Þenne Ioseph hente a staf þat stod him bi-syde, strikes to þis Appolin with a strong wille, þat his nekke to-barst and brak al to pouder, and þe fend of his bodj fley? to þe lufte. þenne þei leuen him þer and goþ touward oþure; þe kyng bowes to his pors him offring to beode. “Let beo,” seis Iosaphe “I leeue þe beo bettre; For and þou profre him eny I schal do [þe] to preue, vppon sodeyne deþ þou schalt sone dye.” “Do tel me,” seis þe kyng “I haue þe muche truste, Of þis tholomer and me hou schal hit tyden?” And he onsweres a?eyn “I dar not wel sigge, for þis cristene men þat vmbe mong ?ongen.

Þe kyng boskes lettres a-non to bounen his bernes, Comaundes hem to meeten him tymely on þe morwen, At þe Castel of Carboye þer he beden hade, was fiftene myle fro sarras I-holden, And oþer fiftene myle fro þenne as þei lei?en. þenne Ioseph takes him forþ and seiþ him þis wordes, “wostou what þou do, kyng nou þat þou wendes? Of þi comynge a-?ein const þou not telle. Such signe me is tau?t þou art of cun symple; forsoþe A mon was þi fader þat couþe schon a-mende! þat tyme þat Augustes cesar was Emperour of Rome, þou wast lenged in þe lond þat þat lord ou?te.

He was an old mon weried of werre, And þou weore a ?ong mon in þi grete strengþe. For þou toke his enemy and brou?test him to honde, forþi he ?af þe þis lond after his lyue. Hit is not allynge to carpe, sire kyng wher-of we comen.” He takes non [hede] heere-to bote askes him of þe sweuene þat he mette on þe niht and bad he scholde him telle. “whon þat þou comest a?eyn wite þou schalt forsoþe, þou miht haue more redi roume my rikenyng to here!” Ioseph[e] takes his scheld and schapes a-middes A crois of red cloþ and kennes him aftur, whon his peril weore most to crist he scholde preyen, for þer scholde no mon verreili þat vigore bi-holden, þat he nis saaf þat dai and his sore passed. Þenne he buskes touward þe bente þer þis oþer byden, He arayes his riche men and rihtes hem swiþe. A-non tholomers men woxen þe biggore; sone beeren hem a-bac and brouhten hem to grounde; And þei tornede a-?ein þat tyme hit was non oþer. þei come bi tholomers tentes vn-housed hem sone, Token holliche his stor and a-wei strei?ten, þat þei come to a Castel faste be-syde. þe kyng was gon to pleye him bi a water brimme, þen com on prikynge prest him a-?eynes. He seide, “my ladi þe queene ou a lettre sende, Biddes ou wihtly be boun to don as heo biddes.” And he redes hit forþ and fond þer-on sone, þat he scholde wiþ-drawe him al a-wei þenne, Or elles tholomers folk wol taken him þere; Forþi heo wole þat he wite and warnes him beotime. “Ho has witered hire of þis and ho has hire kenned?” He onsweres a-non “sire, I not forsoþe. Bote þe two cristene men þat bydes ow at court, in gret counseil han I-beo I trouwe hit be þer aboute;”— And he telles hem þenne of þe qwene sonde þorw counseil of Iosaphe and Ihesu þei þonken. Þe kyng Boskes lettres a-non to boune mo bernes; bi þat þe ni?t was a-weye And þe day on þe morwe, þei hadden of newe folk fourtene þousend. He sei? vnder a wode-egge siker bi hem-seluen Freschliche I-diht Fyue hondred men of Armes. On vn-castes his helm and to þe kyng rydes, And he kneu? him wel he was his wyues broþer, was I-called Seraphe a ?ong Erl forsoþe, and a dou?ti þer-wiþ in alle goode deedes; He mihte neuer gete loue of þe kyng much ne luyte, ne good herte of him and he non harm seruede. He seide, “my ladi þe Qwene me a lettre sende, ?if euere I halp hire at neode I scholde hit now cuiþe; And I am come to þi wille sire, wiþ þis knihtes.” “Forsoþe,” he seis, “seraphe so þou euele ou?test; Ofte I haue for-set þe þat me sore forþinkes, For euere þe kuynde wol be frend for ou?t þat mai bi-falle.” Now þei bouwe touward þe bente þer þis oþere houen; He arayes his riche men and rihtes hem bettre, þat þorw him reowen no res þat his red wrou?ten. þenne seis Seraphe “holdes ou stille, And þenkes on, goode men þe gref is oure childre; what wol bi-falle þer-of and we ben confoundet. Betere hit were douhtilyche to di?en on or oune, þen wiþ schendschupe to schone and vs a-bak drawe.” þei han geten on hem þe lengþe of a gleyue: whon Seraphe sei? þat men þei mi?te I-seo sone his polhache go and proude doun pallede. In þe þikkeste pres he preuede his wepne, Breek braynes a-brod brusede burnes, Beer bale in his hond bed hit a-boute. He hedde an hache vppon hei? wiþ a gret halue, Huld hit harde wiþ teis in his two hondes; So he frusschede hem with and fondede his strengþe, þat luyte mi?te faren him fro and to flui?t founden. þere weore stedes to struien stoures to medlen, Meeten mi?tful men mallen þorw scheldes, Harde hauberkes to-borsten and þe brest þurleden. Schon schene vppon schaft schalkene blode. þo þat houen vppon hors heowen on helmes. þo þat hulden hem on fote hakken þorw scholdres. mony swou?ninge lay þorw schindringe of scharpe, And starf aftur þe deþ in a schort while. þer weoren hedes vn-huled helmes vphaunset; harde scheldes to-clouen on quarters fellen, slen hors and mon holliche at enes. Þe stiward of Eualak in þe stour lafte, lai streiht on þe feld striken to þe eorþe. Now Eualac and tholomer twies han a-semblet; Seraphe takes of heore men wel a two hundred, to wende to a Roche was faste bi-syde. Hedde þei geten þat holt for certeyne soþe, þei mihten haue do muche harm er þei han hem mihte. þenne com on wiþ a tale and Tholomer he telles, And seis him hou Seraphe has his men serued; His broþer and a batayle weore bosket bi-sydes, And he sende him word he scholde þider seche, And þei come swiftly vppon and swengeden to-gedere. Seraphe was of hem wel war and faste hem a-scries; He mette a gome on an hors with a gret route, He hente vp his hachet and huttes him euene, Al to-hurles þe helm and þe hed vnder. wiþ þe deþ in his hals dounward he duppes, and þat deruede hem muche on þat oþer syde, for þe kyng Tholomer was treweli his broþer. þen Seraphe fondes in he and fourti knihtes, þer þe batayle was stiffest and of more strengþe. þenne þei fullen for grame to Seraphe knihtes; þei han laft him a-lyue but vnneþe seuene. Sikerli þe seuene weore slayen at þe laste, Him wondet þer-wiþ and wemmet so sore, þat he was in swounynge and fel to þe grounde. Sone þenne he starte vp and strei?te to his hache, culles on mennes hedes þat þei doun lyen, Siþen cacches his hors and a-wei wendes. Bote euer-more Seraphe askes and cries, “where was Eualac?” þe stour was so þikke. wel a fyue þousend men of tholomeres halue weore bytwene hem two þat to him he ne mihte, And he nedde bote fourti men folewynde his brydel. And þei were weri of-fou?ten and feor ouer-charged, Of þe peple afurst and þe pres after; luyte wonder hit was so þey wrou?t haden. Þenne was Eualac taken and woundet ful sore; And þe kyng tholomer takes him to kepe, Ferde in-to a forest faste bi-syde, forte fallen him feye er þei a-?eyn ferden. þenne he vn-keuered his scheld &amp; on þe cros biholdes; He sei? a child strau?t þer-on stremynge on blode, And he bi-sou?te him of grace as he was godes foorme. þenne he sei? a whit kniht comynge him a-?eines, boþe Armure and hors al as þe lilye, A red cros on his scheld seemed him feire; Rydes to tholomer rad wiþ þat ilke, Baar him doun of his hors and harmed him more, strok him stark ded þat he sturede neuere. Siþen he fonges forþ a ferly wepne, fel hem fei?e to his feet þat him hedde folewed. þenne he horses Eualac on tholomeres steede, bouwes touward þe batayle bigly and swiþe. Euer-more Eualac askes and cries, “where was Seraphe?” and sei? him wiþ þat ilke, wher seue knihtes him han sikerliche a-sayled, and titli bi-gonnen to take him bi þe bridel. þe white kniht wiþ his swerd swyngede to hem sone; whon þe sixe weoren dede þe seueþe a knyf cauhte, And wolde ha striken Seraphe at a stude derne, vppon an hole of his helm and he was so for-fou?ten þat he hedde no space spedly him-seluen forto do him no dispit þe sporn was his owne. whon Eualac þat sau? he fel to þe grounde, And Seraphe also and boþe lye [a] swoune. þe white kniht lihtes doun and boþe hem vp-liftes; þer nas no lynde so liht as þise two leodes, whon þei blencheden a-boue and eiþer sei? oþer. þenne seis Seraphe “scheu? me myn hache, and I schal note hit to-day my strengþe is so newed.” “Haue her-on,” seis þe white kniht “vppon my bihalue; God sende þe þis þat al þe grace lenes.” whon he hedde hit in honde he heold hit þe betere, And þe heuior bi fer þen he bi-foren hedde; Nas þer ?ong mon ne old þat ?ernloker wrou?te þen Eualac and Seraphe wher-so-euer þei sou?ten, Also fresch as þe hauk freschore þat tyme, þen þei foundeden þidere in heore furste come. But euer-more þe white kniht hem þe place roumede, Hit falles not for to sei?e þe fere of his duntes. þer he lousede his hond he leyde hem on Ronkes, and welde hem bi-foren at his oune wille. þe stiward of Tholomer stoffes hem to-gedere, and seis, “þei ben a-middes þe Reume and mowe not hom reche, ne heo knowe not in the lond forþi þei moten lenge.” þenne þe folk of þe Roche hem in face kepten, maden þer a siker werk and slowen hem vp clene. Eualac and Seraphe wonder hem þhou?te wher þe white kniht bi-com þat won hem þe prys; þei nuste where he was ne on whuche syde. þenne seis Seraphe þat hom he wolde wende, He is woundet ful sore to winnen his ese. “Trewely,” seis Eualac “þow schalt wiþ me to court, And two wonderful men þou schalt seo þere; þei tolde me of vche a poynt ar I fro home wente, al-to-gedere of þis werk hou hit is wonne.” Nou we leuen þe kyng and of Ioseph carpen, þat restes him in Sarras bi-leued wiþ þe qweene. “Hou trouwestou of my lord?” heo seis “tydes him hele, Has he folfulsened þe sawes þat þou bi-fore seidest?” “?e, þorw þe miht of god þe maystrie is wonnen, And þorw his swete grace þe sarrest is passed.” “?e, I wol bi-hote þe heer þi lawe for to holden, whon þat my lord is comen þat schal I furst fongen.” “Do me sikernesse þer-to” seis Ioseph þenne. “I wole my trouþe þe bi-take I wol þe nout trayse.” “Nay, þou hast non,” seis he “for certeyn soþe, ?e han be fastned wiþ hem þat ferden wiþ luitel.” “Tel me what is þin and what hit signefyes?” And he tolde hire a-non trewely him-seluen, And heo rikenede a-?eyn radly and sone, Also redili as he and wonder he hedde. “I schal sei?e þe, Ioseph for certeyn soþe, hou I tok crstendom and in what tyme. while my moder lyuede heo hedde an vuel longe, And sou?te in-to diuerse studes and mihte haue non hele. þenne wonede an hermite faste bi-syde; Semely vppon a day þidere we souhten; Heo bad þis hermyte he scholde hire hele sende. ‘I am sinful as þou,’ he seis ‘I mai þe non graunte.’ ‘No mak þi preyere to him,’ heo seis ‘þat þin hope is inne?’ ‘woldestou leeue vppon him,’ he seis ‘I wolde þe bi-hote, þat þou scholdest ben hol ar þou henne eodest.’ He made hire to knele a-doun and a bok bradde, Radde a gospel þer-on and bad hire vp rise, And heo was lihtned of hire euel in a luytel stounde. þenne heo seide to me ‘dou?ter ful deore, woltou beo as I am and on þis mon leue?’ And I wepte water warm and wette my wonges, And seide his bert was so hor I bad not on him leeue. And he seide to me ‘dou?ter, he is feirore, þat þi moder has I-helet nou in þis tyme, þen I or þou or out þat is formed.’ And I tolde him a-?eyn ‘and he so feir weore as my broþer is at home I wolde on him leeue.’ ‘Sikerly, dou?ter,’ he seis ‘so may grace sende þat þou mi?t seo him þi-self ar þow henne seche.’ Þenne com Ihesu crist so cler in him-seluen, aftur þe furste blusch we ne mi?te him bi-holden, And a wynt and a sauor whappede us vmbe, we weore so wel of vr-self we nuste what we duden. He vsede of Goddes bord &amp; a writ brouhte, bi-tau?te me and my moder murily to holden; þus cristendom I tok in þat ilke tyme.” “whi hastou let so longe þi lord þis lyf leden?” “Sire, forsoþe,” heo seis “syker I ne dorste, He is so feol in him-self for no þing be-knowen, Bote herkene of god whon he his grace sende. Hastou not herd þi-self hou euel he was to torne?” Now þe kyng comes to sarras and mony on him suwen; As sone as he com hom I hete þe forsoþe, He askede after a-non nomeliche þeose tweyne, Sette him on his bed and hem on ciþer syde. “A! Ioseph,” seiþ þe kyng “soþe aren þi wordes, þat þou toldest me furst ?or foundeour be blesset!” “Ho is þat?” seis Seraphe and [he] onswerde sone, “he þat halp þe wiþ sound fro þe seue knihtes”— Tolde hem vche a poynt þat þei wrou?t haden; Hou he wuste þerof wonder hem þou?te. Þenne com on fro þe fiht þat foule was wemmed, was striken of þat on Arm and bar hit in þat oþer. þen Ioseph asked þe kynges scheld And bad þat mon knele, þe arm helede a-?eyn hol to þe stompe. þenne com Seraphe and fullou?t furst askes. In þe nome of þe fader Ioseph him fulwede, And calles him Naciens and his nome tornde: he was þe forme þat day þat fongede trouþe. whon he Baptised was þis oþere bi-heolden, Heom þou?te he leomede as liht al on a lowe; þei se?en þe holy-gost at his mouþ descenden, And he speek þenne þat bi-foren ne kneu?. Þenne com he wiþ þe sore Arm þat þorw þe grace was holpen; In þe nome of þe fader Ioseph him folwed, clepen him Cleomadas and callen him after. þenne com þe kyng Eualac and fullouht askes; In þe nome of þe fader Ioseph him folwede, Called him Mordreyns ‘a lat mon’ in trouþe. þen com þe folk to Iosaphe so þikke, He tok a basin of gold in boþe two his hondes, Vppon þe hei?e trinite he let water hi?e, And hedde fulwed bi non mo þen fyue þousend. þenn seis Iosaphe þat Ioseph his fader mot a-byden him and dwelle þer stille, while þat he and Naciens gon nouþer þei nusten, forte cristene þe folk and casten þe false. But þere an vnsely kyng in prison hem caste, wiþ muche serwe to him-self siker atte laste; For þe kyng Mordreyns com with such strengþe, forte liuere hem out on lyue he lafte none. Siþen þei bi-tau?ten þe blod twei burnes to holden, And þei lenden of þe toun and leuen hit þere.</field>
