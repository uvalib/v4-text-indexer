Naiad of this healthful stream, Fair Laurentia, if I deem Rightly of thy office here, If the theme may please thine ear, Listen gracious to my lays, While the springs of Health I praise: Nor will less thy glory shine, If their praise I blend with thine. For of their renown of old Stories many Fame hath told: Antient bards their name have sung Heroes, kings, and gods among, And with various titles grac'd, While their fountain-head they trac'd. Whether See Mr. Selden's notes on the third song of Drayton's Polyolbion, where, in an antient fragment of rimes, are enumerated all the ingredients which Bladud imployed in making the baths. Bladud, king of yore, Skill'd in philosophic lore, Mingling various kinds of earth, Metallic, gave the waters birth, King's-Bath nam'd, beneath thy feet Boiling ay with mineral heat: Or, whether from his car on high Phœbus saw with amorous eye The fountain-nymph, with humid train, Light of foot, trip o'er the plain; Strait the god, inflam'd with love, Swift descending from above, All in fervors bright array'd Press'd her bosom; and the maid Gladly to his warm embrace Yielded; whence the happy place, Where the nymph he woo'd and won, Was call'd the Aquæ solis. Bath. Sol in hàc urbe templum habuit, et nomen quod exhibet Antoninus, loco dedit. Antonini lter XIV, published by Gale. WATERS OF THE SUN. FAME that title widely spred; Yet, ere Roman legions fled The wrath of sturdy British knights, Pallas claim'd religious rights; British Pallas etiam, teste Solino, fontibus hisce fuit præful, suamque habuit ædem, ubi et perpetuos ignes. Ab eâ, appellabatur Britannis, Caer Palladour: Urbs aquæ Palladiæ. Ibid. PALLADOUR then rose, From the goddess nam'd, who chose Near her favourite streams to dwell, Guardian of the sacred well. But long since The goddess of health. HYGEIA fair Under her peculiar care Receiv'd the springs; for well she knows Each salubrious rill that flows Forth from subterranean vaults, Stor'd by NATURE's hand with salts, Steel, or sulphur: for her use NATURE opens every sluice, Which HYGEIA gives in charge To sev'ral nymphs: Herself at large Roams o'er hill, and dale, and plain, Lacky'd by a duteous train; Oreads, Naiads, Dryads, pay Service glad: Some smooth her way, Or mists disperse, or brush the trees; Others waft the morning-breeze From mountain-tops; adown the hills Others pour refreshing rills, Or bathe her limbs in fountain neat, Aiding, all, her influence sweet. She with smiling eye surveys Rustic labours, and conveys Strength to the active thresher's arm, To village-maidens Beauty's charm. Happy are the sons of earth Whom the goddess at their birth Shin'd on. Yet, her heavenly ray Numbers, not respecting, stray From her presence, and pursue Luxury's paths, whose sordid crew, Lust inordinate, and Sloth, And Gluttony's unwieldy growth, Lead them on to Shame, and Pain, And Maladies, an endless train. Oft with pangs distracting torn Thy Hygeia's absence mourn; Bitter change! their languid eyes Feel not joy in sunny skies; Nor doth Night, with slumber blest, Close them at the hour of rest. And oft with sighs, and tears, and prayer Half-suppress'd by sad despair, They the queen of health implore Her wish'd presence to restore. Nor unmindful of their woes Is the goddess; for she chose Thee, Laurentia, loveliest maid Among thy sister nymphs, who play'd On the banks of The river which runs by Bath. Avon, Thee, Bright-ey'd nymph, she chose to be Her substitute, and pow'r she gave Sov'reign o'er the healing wave Which Thou rul'st with gentle sway. Thee the smoking tides obey, Joyous; and at thy command Wash thy The effects of the hot water. rosy-finger'd hand; Thence in crystal cups convey'd Yield their salutary aid To all, whom thou with look benign Smil'st on round Hygeia's shrine; All of appetite deprav'd, Those whom pale-ey'd Spleen enslav'd, Cripples bent with gouty pain, Whom Jaundice ting'd with muddy stain, Or whose frame of nerves, with stroke Benumning, tremulous Palsy broke. These the balmy, cordial stream Quaff, rejoicing; thee, their theme Of praise, extol; thy tender care, Thy soft address, and courteous air: And while The musick in the Pump-room. Harmony, the friend Of Health, delights to recommend Thy ministry, thy charms inspire Love, and joy, and gay desire: For, the Goddess, when she gave Rule imperial o'er the wave, To adorn the gift, and grace thy state, On thee bade Youth and Beauty wait. Nor dost Thou not taste delight Where thou sitt'st in duteous plight; For, the joy, thy hand bestows, Back to thee redounding flows, When the cheek of faded hue, Thou seest displaying roses new. Thee suspended Over Bladud's image in the king's bath hang many crutches. crutches please, Signal trophies from disease Won to Health victorious. Hail, Comfort and support of frail Human state! Hail, blooming maid! Nymph belov'd, without thy aid, He, who, greeting thee, his lays Now attunes to notes of praise, Mute had been, oppress'd with pain Of spasm rheumatic. Hail again, Priestess of Hygeia's shrine! Still dispense her gift divine, Still her vot'ries lead to Health; Else what profits Marlborough's wealth, Lady Betty Spencer, daughter of the duke of Marlborough, married March 13, 1756, to Henry Earl of Pembroke. ????????? ??? ??????? ?? ???????? ????? ???????? ?????? ?? ????????. Lucian. Eliza's form, and Earl of Chesterfield. Stanhope's wit, And all the eloquence of Pitt Afterwards Earl of Chatham.. VACATION. 1758. Hence, sage, mysterious Law, That sitt'st with rugged brow and crabbed look O'er thy black-letter'd book, And the night-watching student strik'st with awe; Away with thy dull train, Slow-pac'd Advice, Surmise, and squint-ey'd Doubt; Dwell with the noisy rout Of busy men, 'mid cities and throng'd halls, Where Clamour ceaseless bawls, And Enmity and Strife thy state sustain. But on me thy blessings pour, Sweet Vacation. Thee, of yore, In all her youth and beauty's prime, Summer bore to aged Time, As he one sunny morn beheld her Tending a field of corn: the elder There 'mid poppies red and blue, Unsuspected nearer drew, And, with softly-sliding pace Hast'ning to a stol'n embrace, Fill'd her with thee; and joy and mirth Hung on thy auspicious birth. Come, sweet goddess; full of play, Ever unconfin'd and gay, Bring the leisure Hours with thee Leading on the Graces three Dancing; nor let aught detain The Holidays, a smiling train: Whose fair brows let Peace serene Crown with olive-branches green. Bring too Health with ruddy cheek, Lively air, and count'nance sleek, Attended, as she's wont to be, With all her jolly company Of exercises, chace, and flight, Active strength, and cunning sleight, Nimble feats, and playful bouts, Leaps of joy, and cheerful shouts, Tricks and pranks, and sports and games, Such as youthful Fancy frames. And, O kind goddess, add to these Cheerful Content, and placid Ease; Not her who fondly sitteth near, Dull Indolence in elbow'd chair; But Ease who aids th' harmonious Nine, Tuning their instruments divine, And without whom, in lofty strain, Phœbus' client tries in vain To raise the feeble voice above The crowd, and catch the ear of Jove. And do thou, Vacation, deign To let me pass among thy train: So may I, thy vot'ry true, All thy flow'ry paths pursue, Pleased still with thee to meet In some friendly rural seat; Where I gladsome oft survey Nature in her best array, Woods and lawns and lakes between, Fields of corn and hedges green, Fallow grounds of tawny hue, Distant hills, and mountains blue; On whose ridge far off appears A wood (the growth of many years) Of awful oak, or gloomy pine, Above th' horizon's level line Rising black: such those of old Where British Druids wont to hold Solemn assemblies, and to keep Their rites, unfolding myst'ries deep, Such that fam'd Dodona's grove, Sacred to prophetic Jove. Oft I admire the verdant steep, Spotted white with many a sheep, While, in pastures rich below Among the grazing cattle, slow Moves the bull with heavy tread Hanging down his lumpish head, And the proud steed neigheth oft' Shaking his wanton mane aloft. Or, traversing the wood about, The jingling packhorse-bells remote I hear, amid the noontide stillness, Sing through the air with brassy shrillness; What time the waggon's cumbrous load Grates along the grav'lly road: There onward, dress'd in homely guise, Some unregarded maiden hies. Unless by chance a trav'lling 'squire, Of base intent and foul desire, Stops to insnare, with speech beguiling, Sweet innocence and beauty smiling. Nor fail I joyful to partake The lively sports of country wake, Where many a lad and many a lass Foot it on the close-trod grass. There nimble Marian of the green Matchless in the jig is seen, Allow'd beyond compare by all The beauty of the rustic ball: While, the tripping damsels near, Stands a lout with waggish leer; He, if Marian chance to shew Her taper leg and stocking blue, Winks and nods and laughs aloud, Among the merry-making crowd, Utt'ring forth in aukward jeer, Words unmeet for virgin's ear. Soon as ev'ning clouds have shed Their wat'ry store on earth's soft bed, And, through their flowing mantles thin, Clear azure spots of sky are seen, I quit some oak's close-cover'd bow'r, To taste the boon of new-fall'n show'r, To pace the corn-field's grassy edge Close by a fresh-blown sweet-brier hedge; While at every green leaf's end Pearly drops of rain depend, And an earthy fragrance 'round Rises from the moisten'd ground. Sudden a sun-beam, darting out, Brightens the landskip all about, With yellow light the grove o'erspreads, And tips with gold the haycocks' heads: Then, as mine eye is eastward led, Some fair castle rears its head, Whose height the country round commands, Well known mark to distant lands, There the windows glowing bright Blaze from afar with ruddy light, Borrow'd from clouds of scarlet dye, Just as the sun hath left the sky. But, if chill Eurus cut the air With keener wing, I then repair To park or woodland, shelter meet, Near some noble's ancient seat, Where long winding walks are seen Stately oaks and elms between, Whose arms promiscuous form above High over-arch'd a green alcove; While the hoarse-voic'd hungry rook Near her stick-built nest doth croak, Waving on the topmast bough; And the master stag below Bellows loud with savage roar, Stalking all his hinds before. Thus musing, night with even pace Steals on, o'ershad'wing nature's face; While the bat with dusky wings Flutters round in giddy rings, And the buzzing chaffers come Close by mine ear with solemn hum. Homeward now my steps I guide Some rising grassy bank beside, Studded thick with sparks of light, Issuing from many a glow-worm bright; While village-cur with minute bark Alarms the pilf'rer in the dark, Save what light the stars convey, Cluster'd in the milky way, Or scatter'd numberless on high Twinkling all o'er the boundless sky. Then within doors let me meet The viol touch'd by finger neat; Or, soft symphonies among, Wrap me in the sacred song, Attun'd by Handel's matchless skill, While Attention, mute and still, Fixes all my soul to hear The voice harmonious, sweet and clear. Nor let smooth-tongu'd Converse fail, With many a well-devised tale, And stories link'd, to twist a chain That may awhile old Time detain, And make him rest upon his scythe Pleas'd to see the hours so blithe: While, with sweet attractive grace, The beauteous housewife of the place Wins the heart of every guest By courteous deeds, and all contest Which shall readiest homage shew To such sov'reign sweetness due. These delights, Vacation, give, And I with thee will choose to live. TO A LADY, VERY HANDSOME, BUT TOO FOND OF DRESS. Prythee why so fantastic and vain? What charms can the toilet supply? Why so studious, admirers to gain? Need Beauty lay traps for the eye? Because that thy breast is so fair, Must thy tucker be still setting right? And canst thou not laughing forbear, Because that thy teeth are so white? Shall sovereign beauty descend To act so ignoble a part? Whole hours at the looking-glass spend, A slave to the dictates of art? And cannot thy heart be at rest, Unless thou excellest each fair, In trinkets and trumpery dress'd? Is not that a superfluous care? Vain, idle attempt! to pretend The lily with whiteness to deck! Does the rich solitaire recommend The delicate turn of thy neck? The glossy bright hue of thy hair Can powder or jewels adorn? Can perfumes or vermillions compare With the breath or the blush of the morn? When, embarrass'd with baubles and toys, Thou'rt set out so enormously fine, Over-doing thy purpose destroys, And to please thou hast too much design: Little know'st thou, how beauty beguiles, How alluring the innocent eye; What sweetness in natural smiles, And what charms in simplicity lie. Thee Nature with beauty has clad, With genuine ornaments dress'd; Nor can Art an embellishment add, To set off what already is best: Be it thine, self-accomplish'd to reign: Bid the toilet be far set apart, And dismiss with an honest disdain That impertinent Abigail, Art. ANACREON. ODE III. In the dead of the night, when with labour oppress'd All mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest, Cupid knock'd at my door; I awoke with the noise, And “who is it (I call'd) that my sleep thus destroys?” “You need not be frighten'd, he answered mild, “Let me in; I'm a little unfortunate child; “'Tis a dark rainy night; and I'm wet to the skin; “And my way I have lost; and do, pray, let me in” I was mov'd with compassion; and, striking a light, I open'd the door; when a boy stood in sight, Who had wings on his shoulders; the rain from him dripp'd; With a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd. I stirr'd up my fire, and close by its side I set him down by me: with napkins I dried, I chaf'd him all over, kept out the cold air, And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair. He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease, But taking his bow up, he said, “If you please “We will try it; I would by experiment know “If the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow.” Forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew, To the string he apply'd it, and twang went the yew; The arrow was gone; in my bosom it center'd: No sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd. Away skipp'd the urchin, as brisk as a bee, And laughing, “I wish you much joy, friend, quoth he: “My bow is undamag'd, for true went the dart; “But you will have trouble enough with your heart.” TO MY COUSIN SHANDY, ON HIS COMING TO TOWN. DEAR SHANDY, You know there goes a tale, How Jonas went aboard a whale, Once for a frolic, And the whale set sail With a fair gale, And got the cholic; And after a great splutter Spew'd him up, upon the coast, Just like a woodcock on a toast, With trail and butter. I should have thought him much to blame, Had he gone back the way he came. So when you're over head and ears in debt, You'll fume and fret; When once you're wip'd clean, if you presume To plunge yourself again, fret on and fume. So when a man has lost his wife, He makes a pother: But he deserves to lose his life, If he will ever venture on another. So when a miss just enters in her teens, She makes a coil, Because she knows not what she means; —You lose your labour and your oil. But by and by, After you have taken your degrees, If you will try, You'll be install'd with ease, And you may take a flight Upright, Like me, And drop like Icarus into a vacant sea. And so, because comparisons are odious, Pray tell me plain, Whether the theatre in Drury-lane, Or that of York, is most commodious; And, to oblige you, I'll tell you a story of Elisha:— As he was walking by a wood in sober sadness, Close by a mob of children stood, Commenting on his sober mood, And taking it for madness; In their opinions They hung together just like onions, And back'd them, like such sort of folks, With a few stones, and a few jokes; Till, weary of their pelting and their prattle, He order'd out his bears to battle; It was delightful fun To see them run And eat up the young cattle. Now, had Elisha chang'd the scene, From thinking and walking To drinking and talking, Or any pleasant situation, It would have cur'd the spleen, And sav'd a lapidation. Your affectionate cousin Antony Shandy. An EPISTLE to the grown GENTLEWOMEN the MISSES of ????. Ladies, I love you dearly, And for a proof I send this letter; To deal with you sincerely, I dare not offer any better. Many of your mammas Would look upon it as a sin, Because They and their daughters are so near akin, It would be wading both through thick and thin. Time, the best tutor of all others, Has open'd my deluded eyes; I have made fools enow amongst your mothers, I wish it was as easy to make you wise. This, says Miss Notable, is positive grimace, He thinks to rub the mould off an old face, By being smart and sly; Just as a housewife thinks you'll eat Her fusty meat When it is season'd in a pie. Miss Notable, you are a Cynick, And though in Greek it means a bitch, I only mean you are a mimick, When you set up to be a witch. Can you imagine me so queer An engineer To think of making my advances By fancies? I know that an approach is made Sideways and by insinuation; I know my trade, But not by a rhetorical Or metaphorical Or verbal disputation, But by a real zig-zag operation. I would as soon attempt to take a City With sugar-plumbs Instead of bombs, As take a miss by being witty; Or to take you, When you're in cue To romp and grapple, Like Eve, Taking you only by the sleeve, And pulling out an apple. A miss that's brought up in a boarding-school, Or in a cloister, Is like a stool, And like an oister. For though a bungler can't get at her, An oister-monger who has thought on't well, And understands the matter, Contrives a way into the shell, Like any Eel Into a wheel, Of wicker, Gobbling the oister and the liquor. The reason why she is like a stool, methinks Is this; (I do not mean a stool that stinks) That never can be like a miss; I mean a stool, Not in the nature of a chair, But a mere tool, Placed in a corner here and there With an intent, Not to be useful—but for ornament; Just like the image of a Chinese lubbard, Sitting upon a chimney-piece or cupboard; A joss Sitting with its legs across. Yet when a drawing room is full, Or when a company draws near That blessed sphere, Where all are happy that are dull, And they are taken up with some debater, You clap you down slipping aside, And so your stool is occupy'd Sooner or later. And so a miss that's thrown aside like lumber, Although they watch her, Will find occasions without number, If any one's inclin'd to catch her. When a man's saying all he has to say, And something comes across the way, Without a provocation, I do not call it a digression, But a temptation Which requires discretion. And therefore I petition For leave to give a definition Of the word Reputation; 'Tis an impression or a seal Engrav'd, not upon steel, On a transparent education, Which, held up to the light, Discovers all the strokes and touches That mark the lady of a knight, A mantua-maker, or a duchess. A miss brought up in Fairy Courts, Practis'd in sublunary sports, And contemplations in the dark, Is apt to be surprised By a superior power disguised Like an attorney's Clerk. Oft in the darkest night, when every head Is wrapp'd in sleep, And free from cares, He sallies from the deep, Stealing up the back stairs, And without dread He'll creep Upon you unawares Into your bed. A fairy is a cunning elf, And seldom meditates a rape In any shape That you suspect yourself. Sometimes in front he will appear, Just like a barber's block; And sometimes hang upon your rear, Dress'd in your footman's frock. When once you are enchanted, You are commonly possess'd all night, Like any house that's haunted, And, like a haunted house, a priest must set you right. And then, by reason of your tender age, You are in no less danger From Hamlet and Ranger, The enchanters of the stage. You are not open to so many snares, From dancers, singers, And fiddle-stringers, As from players. Players make love by letters patent, All other artists are excluded, But now and then it has so happen'd, The Law has been eluded; And by a trick of a logician, No lawyer's whim, For instance, if the artist's a musician, You must convert the proposition; That is, you must make love to him. I do not mean, my dears, To alarm you with my fears, Though I could bring examples recent, And make reflections, To shew that such amours are neither decent, Nor good for your complexions. Let but a single spark of fire fall Into a powder-magazine, It blows up all, Quite and clean. So when you have finished a neat billet-doux, All but the stopping, And you're in raptures leaning, A drop of ink, you know not how, Comes dropping, And blots out all the meaning. If you delight in slops, And will be always tasting and touching, You may meet slops where a few drops Will blot your scutcheon: Your face breaks out in spots, or you're inflated To a degree, So as to be Homunculated. I quite forgot I was in such a trance To give a hint, Asquint, About a country dance. Dancing contributes greatly, 'tis confess'd, To open and dilate your chest, And is exceeding good To purify the blood And humours. But if you sit too long, and cool too quick, Your hand is seiz'd and you fall sick. It feels as if it felt—all over—tumours, Shaking, as if you shook a stick, Tingling and numb, Finger and thumb, Paralitick. If people would but stick to their professions, You would be dancing, Not sitting and romancing, Like an old justice at a sessions. Supposing now you have escaped all rocks, Not without many shocks Amongst the shoals of Calumny and Rancour, Thank Heaven, you are not stranded; Throw out your anchor, And then do what you please when you are landed. Sure I speak plain enough, you understand That I would have you marry out of hand; Whether you wed a coxcomb or a sloven, By fair means or by covin. Marriage resembles a perpetual oven. Your chief expence and trouble's in the making, Which need not be repeated, Unless you are cheated, From the first time you put a cake in. For after that, without being heated, It will continue fit for baking; Constantly ready, night and day, If you don't bake at home, your neighbour may. Do but contemplate a pudding's end, There is a string goes round about Her snout. The string is very much the pudding's friend, He keeps her within bounds, or else she would be spoil'd, And by his means she gets well boil'd. Look at that spit again, What is it keeps your meat from burning; It is a chain That humours it in turning; And by that means, as you have often boasted, Your meat is always nicely roasted. Just such another tye is marriage; I take the marriage-noose or wedding-ring, If you are prudent in your carriage, To be a pudding-string. And for the marriage-chain, 'tis prov'd as clear as glass To be but a jack-chain—a chain for a jack-ass. 'Tis all made out as fine as silk: And now attend, my lovely lasses, And I'll provide you all with asses. —You shall not want for asses milk. I wish a miss was like a leek, Whose head is long And strong, Although the tail Be frail And weak. Then would I tell you all I have to speak: Conceal your feelings, and dissemble Whether you resemble The proud or meek. Meekness and pride alike inflame desire, A truth well known amongst the wenchers; So oil or brandy, thrown into the fire, Are neither of them quenchers. Take that which suits you best, my gentle dames, Either will do, to set a house in flames. 'Tis not sufficient to inflame; You must provoke, but you must tame. Observe the anglers, They don't take every fish that comes; So many of your danglers Are but bull-heads and millers'-thumbs. A captain, or some pretty fellow, May dangle with you at a rout; Just as they fish for salmon with a menow, Or a red clout. But when you walk with Strephon arm in arm, And feel all over new-milk warm, Whilst he complains of penalties and pains; You'll seem Like an iced cream If you have any brains. Adam was weary of a single life, And seeing Eve bashful and nice, He thought her fitter for a wife, Than any beast in Paradise. So when a 'squire sees a maiden coy, He makes a jointure; And in a fit of joy, Prefers her to a pointer. Milton's Delay “And sweet reluctant amorous delay.” Paradise Lost. B. IV. L. 311., it is no word of my inventing, Lies in a point, If you can hit the joint, Between forbidding and consenting. Just like the cream of which you have been told, Delicious, when 'tis not too cold. All small delays are right, They make folks keen, Whether they mean To play or fight. So at a battle and a cocking, The combatants, before they let them go, Stand a little while and crow. And when you throw the stocking, After the bride and bridegroom's bedded; The bride, encouraged by that pause, Yields to the laws, And is beheaded. A NOSEGAY and a SIMILE for the REVIEWERS. 1760. Ye Overseers and Reviewers Of all the Muses, Sinks, and Sewers, Who dwell on high Enthron'd amongst your peers The Garetteers, That border on the sky; Who hear the music of the spheres, You have such ears, And live so nigh! I thank you for your criticism, Which you have usher'd in With a delightful witticism, That tastes like rotten fruit preserv'd in gin; And therefore marvel not that my two ballads, Which are but like two sallads, By no means suit, Like your fruit, With your palates. I do admire your dealings, To speak according to your feelings; And do believe, if you had wherewithall You would drop honey, And that you overflow with gall, Because you do not overflow with money: Hence all your spite Against a poor conundrummite, Whose only business is to watch Where the conundrums lie, And be upon the catch As they go by; To make a simile in no one feature Resembling the creature, That he has in his eye; Just as a fisher shoots an owl Or a sea-fowl, To make the likeness of a fly; Just as you look into a fire, To look for any likeness you desire. Simile-making Is an undertaking, In which the undertaker Resembles a match-maker, A poor industrious man, Who means no ill, And does the best he can With a quill; In short, he does according to his skill. If matters can be brought to bear So as to tie the knot, He does not care Whether they are a happy pair, Or not; Though one may differ very wide, And though another be deficient, Provided he can get them ty'd And lay them side by side, It is sufficient; And as I said at first, Nothing could make you all so keen, And curs'd, But that which makes you all so lean, Hunger and thirst. So now and then a judge Consigns a wretch To master Ketch, Having no grudge, No reason that can be assigned, Only, like you, he has not dined. So far from wishing your allowance shorter, I wish, for all our sakes, That you may never want beef-stakes And porter; And, for your merits, A dram of British spirits. And so I leave you with a fable, Designed, without a sneer, To exhilarate your table, And give a flavour to your beer. Hark! And if you please take warning: My fable is concerning A Cuckow and a Lark. If I had said a nightingale, You would have cry'd, You could not fail, That it was pride, And nought beside, That made me think of such a tale. Upon a tree as they were sitting, They fell into a warm dispute, Warmer than was sitting, Which of them was the better flute; After much prating and debating, Not worth relating, Things came to such a pass, They both agree To take an Ass For referee. The ass was studying botany and grass, Under the tree. What do you think was his decree? Why, says the ass, the question is not hard, And so he made an excellent award, As you shall see. The Lark, says he, Has got a wild fantastic pipe, But no more music than a snipe; It gives one pain, and turns one's brain, One can't keep time to such a strain; Whereas the Cuckow's note Is measur'd, and compos'd with thought. His method is distinct and clear, And dwells, Like bells, Upon the ear. Which is the finest music one can hear. I can distinguish, I'll lay a wager, His manner and expression, From every forester and cager Of the profession. This ended the dispute, the Cuckow was quite mute With admiration: The Lark stood laughing at the brute Affecting so much penetration. The Ass was so intoxicated, And shallow-pated, That, ever since, He has got a fancy in his skull That he has a commission from his prince, Dated when the moon's at full, To summon every soul, Every Ass and Ass's foal, To try the quick and dull, Trumpeting through the fields and streets, Stopping and judging all he meets. All that he knows, That I can find, Is from the information of his nose Apply'd unto the parts behind; And by the smell, 'Tis wonderful how he will tell, Whether their parts are to his mind; Pronouncing with an air Of one pronouncing from the chair, Here is a beauty! This is new! And that's a blemish, For which I have no relish; Just like the Critical Review! FABLES FOR GROWN GENTLEMEN: OR, A FABLE FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK. 1761. FABLE I. THE RIVER WITH A PETITION. According to the Romish creed, I speak of Rome two thousand years ago, The life that they suppos'd the Gods to lead, You would not chuse to undergo. Jupiter's business, day and night, Was to attend with open ears and eyes, And to write down as fast as he could write All the impertinence that men devise Besides men's fopperies and ravings, The women had so great a share, That their absurdities and cravings Omnipotence alone could bear. And furthermore, to try his patience, He heard the prayers and fanciful distresses Of all his children and relations, And of his wife and his mis-tresses. Once on a time, if you'll believe tradition, A river in great tribulation, To Juplter presented a petition, With an expostulating exhortation; Whereby, if the petitioner's refus'd, He has a right to think himself ill-us'd; A form of prayer contriv'd for execution, Exactly like a double-barrell'd gun, Which if you fire with resolution, You have another chance when one is done: So far from killing two birds with one stone, An art that's very little known; All the petitioner desir'd to do, Was to kill one with two. Now this petition shew'd how the petitioner For his attachment and devotion, Had been appointed a commissioner Of the revenues of the Ocean, Which he collected with great pains, And sent in good and current cash, But for his trouble and clear gains, The Sea return'd adulterated trash: Wherefore he pray'd, Exhorted and submitted, That all the sums the Ocean pay'd Shall for the future be remitted, And issued fair, Without debasement or impair. Ungrateful Thames! the God reply'd Without that mixture and alloy, Which the Sea pours into thee every tide, Thy beauty and thy strength would wear away. Without his aid thou wouldst remain Like Tiber, or the poor pretending Seine, Led through parterres or roll'd down a cascade, Confin'd to vanity, and lost to trade. 'Tis thus the Highlander complains, 'Tis thus the Union they abuse For binding their back-sides in chains, And shackling their free feet in shoes: For giving them our food and fewel, And comfortable cloaths; Instead of cruel oat-meal gruel; Instead of rags and heretable blows. Luxury every day grows stronger; The Highland fair, Beholds her lover now no longer; Trotting with his buttocks bare. Thus Doctor Brown was taken with the spleen, And fancied we were all undone, Raving about a carpet and a screen, And out of temper with the sun: Because it is a crime, As he supposes, For men to run in winter time Into the sun to warm their noses. 'Tis an egregious want of sense, A want of taste and want of shame, When universal affluence And luxury are deem'd the same. Good Doctor, spite of your discerning, The term of Universal will agree With your benevolence and learning, Just as it suits with luxury. You may perceive, if you be so inclin'd, Like your discernment, luxury's confin'd. For as the gout torments the hands and feet, To ease the nobler stomach and the head, So luxury, to gratify the great, Insults and robs the labourer of his bread. Luxury in a state is a disease, Because 'tis partial and obstructed wealth, But universal affluence and ease Is universal happiness and health. FABLE II. The PHENIX and her Lovers. That every female's a Coquette, I could as safely swear upon a book, As I cou'd safely bet, That ev'ry Frenchman is a cook. A Phenix, daughter of the Sun, Chaste as a Vestal, modest as a Nun, Added such merit to her birth, That not a bird, though of the highest fashion, No feather'd Coxcomb of the earth Ventur'd to declare his passion. They all agreed, No earthly bird was worthy of her love; None but a bird of the celestial breed, An angel from above. The Phenix liv'd so long a maid; Till all her gaiety and bloom Began to fade; And savour of the tomb. She mop'd, grew splenetic, and tir'd Of so much awe and so much state; She long'd like other birds to be admir'd, Like other birds she long'd to find a mate. At last she issued out a proclamation To summon the male birds of every nation; Perhaps this summons and this longing Was a political machine, Just like the lovers that came thronging, Summon'd by our virgin Queen. Now, from all quarters, The birds appear'd in their best cloaths; Nobles in stars and garters, Curl'd and embroider'd beaux. Some stately; others light and gay; One coo'd, another sang and flatter'd, Some like the Magpie and the Jay For ever chatter'd. About the inner ring, Where all the Birds of figure press, A bat whirl'd round with leathern wing, To shew his shape and his address, Offering his heart, his eyes and wings to boot, At which there rose a universal hoot. The Phenix answer'd in the tone, And in the self-same manner languish'd, As good Queen Bess when she was shewn, A taylor by her beauty vanquish'd; Take courage man, says she, For if I needs must have a taylor, I promise without failure To marry none but thee. And as the Queen coquetted at an age When other Queens are tame, Till she went off the stage; The Phenix did the same. She died a great coquette, and, what is more, Rose from the grave a greater than before. The Phenix and self-love are the same beast, Within the human breast, Which poets feign the spicy East, She builds her solitary nest; From whence with every gale of wind, The traveller may smell the mind. Her Lovers are our passions; these she meets, Either by appointment or by chance, Which, if she can't indulge, she treats With smiles and complaisance. And, as the Phenix from her ashes rais'd, Returns as blooming as a bride, So when we think it dies, the Lord be prais'd, Self-love springs up again with double pride. 'Tis a determin'd case, None but ourselves can occupy our place. For this same reason, physical and clear, Each individual of us all Is that same Phenix, without any peer, On this terrestrial ball. Lovers are mad-men and a miser Not one jot wiser. Let any try, except a Lover, Or one devoted to his pelf, Whether in all the world thcy can discover Another Self. FABLE III. The DUCKLINGS and the wise birds. A hen one evening, to enjoy the cool, Was walking with a brood of Ducklings callow, Just like a mistress of a boarding-school, With misses green and yellow. As she was tutoring and schooling This bird for loitering, and that for fooling, Behold a fish-pond so alluring, That, spite of her remonstrances and cackle, They ventur'd their whole stock without ensuring, Trusting to their oars and tackle. The Hen kept scolding like a drab, Cursing her rebellious race; We are not thy children, cried a pert young Squab, If we were Chickens we shou'd have more grace; On nature we depend, Our course she steers, Nature's a safer guide, and better friend Than any Dotard's fears. Close by the pond an ancient tower Lifted its venerable head, A college and sequester'd bower, Where Owls for ages had been bred; An old professor, a great clerk, Taught them their talents to display, To keep their eyes wide open in the dark, And shut them in the face of day. To think abstractedly, to reason deep, And to declaim, till all the world's asleep. These students from the tower saw our young folks, Our bold Adventurers, under sail; They heard their clamorous mirth and jokes, And heard their nurse's fruitless wail. Observe, say's one more learned than the rest, These birds by instinct know the season, To sail, to eat, to go to rest, Just as we know by argument and reason. We know from reason and experience both, We see it every hour; That Governors are loth To part with power Yon Hen which you all hear, In such a fright, Undoubtedly affects that fear, To keep her pupils always in her sight. From the same principle, for the same end, Our Tutor keeps us all thus penn'd: Preaching that we must not pretend to fly, We are too weak; it is too soon; This I'll demonstrate is a lie, As clear as the sun at noon. Feet, said the subtle Owl, Are not the things That constitute the essence of a fowl, So much as wings. Whatever is essential to our make We soonest learn, and seldomest mistake. Hence that pathetic prayer, that tender call, By which we get our wants dispatch'd, Is so essential above all, That we all speak the moment we are hatch'd. Nature, benevolent and wise, Opens our mouths much sooner than our eyes. By parity of reason meet, Our wings and pinions should be ready Long time before our heads and feet Are firm and steady. Therefore 'twill follow like a chain, That as we walk, you must confess, With little giddiness and pain, If we attempt it, we must fly with less. This reasoning philosophic wight Convinc'd his brethren one and all: With one accord they took their flight, And fatal and untimely was their fall. None of them reason'd any more, The young logicians lay like wrecks, Drown'd in the pond or scatter'd on the shore, With mangled limbs and broken necks. Bred in a court or some gay city, The Ducklings are those thoughtless spritely fools. O Cambridge, is it not a pity, Strangers to thee, and to thy schools! FABLE IV. LA NOBLESSE DE FRANCE. The fighting COCK and the CRAVEN. A cock, an officer of foot, In France retir'd into a village, Where he did nought but crow and strut, And live by pillage. Whene'er he had a mind To take his pastime with the fair, He was not to one wife confin'd, Nor to a pair; But, like a lord, Had half a dozen both at bed and board. He spied a barn-door fowl one day, Cram'd from the rump up to the gullet, In amorous dalliance and play With a young pullet. His robes and train, his senatorial cap, His size, almost the size of geese, Shew'd that he had been nurtur'd in the lap Of peace. Bred for the bench and presidental chair, He judg'd, he roosted, and digested there. The military cock took as much pleasure As an unlucky page, To see the magistrate employ his leisure So much below his dignity and age. He that should set a good example! Be virtuous and discreet! To tread on modesty, and trample Chastity beneath his feet! Fine times, says he, when judges run Seducing maidens in the open sun! This wanton fit Comes of intemperance and over-eating, Which, as it soon will bring you to the spit, Shall save your reverence from a beating To this reproof, With a sly sneer the judge reply'd aloof: 'Tis true that I and all my brood, When we have run the race assign'd Shall have the honour to become the food And comfort of mankind. An unexpected death Shall gently steal, not force away our breath. Good Colonel, you are mightily mistaken, It is not owing to respect, indeed, That you are neither boil'd, like us, with bacon, Roasted nor fricasséed. But tho' your flesh be men's aversion, Yet it contributes much to their diversion; They give you barley, bread, and oats, Because they take great pleasure and delight To see you fight; To see you cutting one another's throats. If you escape and are not slain in war, You are in a worse plight by far. Amongst the hogs, Wounded and lame upon a dunghill cast, By wanton boys and puppy dogs, Worried or teaz'd to death at last. In France the land-tax is not as 'tis here, A tax where you appeal and squabble; There the nobility go free and clear, Like the rascality and rabble. The same exemption pards and tigers own; And the base polecat caught in gins: Their flesh and bone we let alone, We ask them nothing but their skins. FABLE V. The DOG and the CAT. Interest fascinates both age and youth, And, with a glance of her bewitching eye, Can make a Minister speak truth, Or make a mighty Monarch tell a lie. She can set brothers by the ears, And, what you'll scarce believe, perhaps, Make sisters as harmonious as the spheres, And live together without pulling caps. 'Tis she gives every one her place, Oft, like a blundering marshal at a feast, Joining a scoundrel to his grace, An atheist to a priest. Interest, well understood, Made Solomon, makes Melcomb now declare That life is only good To eat and drink, and laugh, and banish care. Close by a kitchen fire, a dog and cat, Each a famous politician, Were meditating as they sat, Plans and projects of ambition. By the same fire were set to warm, Fragments of their master's dinner; Temptations to alarm, The frailty of a sinner. Clear prurient water stream'd from Pompey's jaws, And Tabby look'd demure, and lick'd her paws; And as two plenipos, For fear of a surprise, When both have something to propose, Examine one another's eyes; Or like two Maids, tho' smit by different swains, In jealous conference o'er a dish of tea, Pompey and Tabby both, cudgell'd their brains, Studying each other's physiognomy. Pompey, endow'd with finer sense, Discover'd in a cast of Tabby's face A symptom of concupiscence, Which made it a clear case. When straight applying to the dawning passion, Pompey address'd her in this fashion; Both you and I, with vigilance and zeal, Becoming faithful dogs, and pious cats, Have guarded day and night this common-weal From robbery and rats; All that we get for this, Heaven knows, Is a few bones and many blows. Let us no longer fawn and whine, Since we have talents and are able; Let us impose an equitable fine Upon our master's table; And, to be brief, Let us each chuse a single dish, I'll be contented with roast beef, Take you that turbot—you love fish. Thus every dog and cat agrees, When they can settle their own fees. Thus two contending chiefs are seen To agree at last in every measure; One takes the management of the marine, The other of the nation's treasure. FABLE VI. The SPIDER and the FLY With malice fell, A spider watch'd within his cell, Ready to sally, Th' unwary traveller to souse, Like a Jew broker in the alley, Or a Dutch merchant in his counting-house, Like them he corresponded far and near, And, tho' his trade was intricate and dark, He manag'd his affairs and kept all clear, Without a partner or a clerk. A petit maître, a gaudy fly, Thinking to scamper unmolested, With airy equipage as he pass'd by, By cruel Cacus was arrested. Furnish'd with that undaunted sense, Which only courts and camps can teach, Having no weapon or defence, Except his instrument of speech, The fly with flattering soporific strains, Tried to benumb the spider's brains: Hearing such daily praise bestow'd, Upon your elegance in weaving, I came to visit your abode, Which is magnificent beyond believing. And now I am convinc'd, if you will drop. The linen trade, And take to weaving velvets and brocade, The sallad-eaters soon must shut up shop, Change but your diet, and, like their's, your taste Will grow refin'd, correct and chaste. As I have study'd every herb and leaf, That's either noxious or good to eat, Make me your caterer in chief, And pourveyor of all your meat. Send me this instant in a trice, I'll bring you something savoury and nice. Seeing the spider smile and grin, He found his plot would not succeed, It was too thin, For one of that sagacious breed; On which he fell a vapouring and buzzing, Swearing the drones would take the alarm, And come to the assistance of their cousin With an enormous swarm. The drones and I are no such strangers, We know, said Cacus, what we both can do, They are too wise to run their heads in dangers, For such a busy meddling fool as you; But, since you come to spoil our manufacture, And poison honest traders, I'll hang you like a malefactor, To terrify invaders. No sooner said than done, He knock'd him down, and hung him in the sun. The spider, like Mynheer, goes on: Is watchful, subtle, and alert, The fly is either proud, like Don; Or like a Frenchman vain and pert. When you are plagu'd with any flies, Spanish or French, small flies or great, Maintain your high spider allies, In order to preserve your meat. FABLE VII. The wild DUCKS and the water SPANIEL. After a tedious flight, Of many a stormy day and night; A flock of wild ducks sailing up and down, Upon a lake were making merry; Like sailors in a sea-port town Just arriv'd from Pondicherry. A swan too stately far for sport, To shew herself was all her view, Had undertaken to escort The jovial crew. Swelling and bridling With all the airs of a fine dame at court; Turning about and sidling, Advancing and then stopping short, Displaying in her features Contempt and insolent dejection, To signify that those strange creatures Were forc'd upon her for protection. I must confess, amongst mankind I have seen swans as foolishly inclin'd. At Paris on the Seine, I have seen a French marquee conduct a pair Of German barons to the fair Of Saint Germaine, Strutting before them, tossing up his head, Then looking back, and lowering his crest, The barons were so awkward, so ill-bred, And so ill-dress'd. Have you not seen a new-made peer With equal pride, but greater trepidations, Observing in his rear A troop of country relations Run up Saint James's-street, and at two leaps, Take Arthur's steps? Those steps as terrible as the Tarpeian, From whence with one black ball you are hurl'd Into another world Amongst the damn'd Plebeian. Perhaps this grave and solemn swan Dislik'd the company of those wild-ducks; Just as a prude, or a sober man, Dislikes the company of bucks. For whilst they made more noise and riot Than twenty justices of peace, The swan was serious and quiet As col'nel Gander marching with his geese, Marching to the field, With gorget and a wooden shield. About the middle of the lake, Upon the banks a water-spaniel lay, Looking out for duck or drake Or any lawful prey; And as the captain of a privateer Lies by, Nor offers to bear down, nor gives a cheer 'Till his expected prize begins to fly, Close to the shore the spaniel let them sail, And rush'd into the lake when they turn'd tail, Snorting and snoring; Pursuing them with all his force, Swearing and roaring, Till he was hoarse; He turn'd and veer'd, Now made a stretch, and then a tack; Now snapp'd, and now they disappear'd, And rose again a long way back; Till the poor spiritless exhausted brute Was forc'd to give up the pursuit. And as the French to Toulon ran, And left the Spaniards in a scrape, The moment that the fray began, The swan made her escape. Quite out of reach, A roan duck upon the beach. Under a shed, Consider'd the whole scene with wonder, Just like Caligula under the bed, Studying the cause of lightning and thunder. As the victorious crew pass'd by in order, He made them an oration; The roan duck being the recorder, Or burgomaster of the corporation. Leave your abandon'd lives, Roving like pirates and Jews, Come hither with your children and your wives, And settle peaceably in our mews. We'll take you without any fuss, Here we have neither law nor code, You are only tied to copy us, And go by custom and the mode; You shall be fashionably dress'd, Protected, treated, and caress'd; A friseur, with an instrument of steel, Shall shape your wings and your toupee, Make them sit perfectly genteel, Easy and free. As to the rest, you may gather from my looks Whether the air is good, And whether we have wholesome food, Or tolerable cooks. Peace, wretch, the chieftain of the ducks reply'd, Nor with thy venal breath offend the brave; Freedom is as much our pride, As it is thine to be a slave. We neither injure nor provoke; We neither fear great nor small, Because we scorn to yield to any yoke, We are hated by them all. From pole to pole pursu'd, From pole to pole, Our enemies have every soul Been baffled and subdu'd. Lords of three elements, we can maintain Our rights, our freedom and possessions, With the same ease that we disdain, Thy offers and insidious professions. In our own virtue we confide, On others how can we rely, When fear or hope, envy or pride May turn a friend into a false ally? Those who depend on others; Whether on males or females they depend, Will find the swan has many brothers, And sisters without end. FABLE VIII. The Advice of an Old SPANIEL. A certain dog of middling birth, Frolicksome and full of play: Even in the height of all his mirth, Delicate as well as gay: With far more feeling for his friend, Than they could either taste or comprehend.— Being thrown into the world betimes, Betimes discover'd it was all a cheat, Yet not so dangerous for odious crimes, As odious for malice and deceit, Oft when he meant to have amus'd His friends with a conceit, or harmless jest, By many he was snarl'd at and abus'd, And slighted even by the best. Oft, when half-starv'd, he found a bone, Or something hid, Instead of eating it alone, As others did, He ran to share his daily bread, Unsought With those that were much better fed Than taught, His daily bread they seiz'd, And drove him from their mess, More disappointed and displeas'd With their ingratitude than his distress It is a maxim amongst dogs,— When they have the address and skill,— To slip their collars and their clogs, And leave their friends that use them ill. To avoid anxiety and strife, Tray was resolv'd to try a country life. A country dog, I think, Is exactly like a country squire, They both are only fit to sleep and stink By their own fire; And when awake are only good To yelp and hollow in a wood. Their joys, And conversation are the same, 'Tis all a clamour and a noise, And all the noise and clamour about game. Three words compose their whole vocabulary, A fox, a hare, and a fine scenting day; Whether they are serious or merry, 'Tis all they have to say: In short, they never are so entertaining, As when they're fast asleep or feigning. To quit such friends as these, One would not grieve: Tray parted from them with great ease, Without so much as taking leave, Consults his grandsire, by profession, A spaniel; For judgement and discretion, A perfect Daniel. Benign and mild, He heard his grandson's grievances, and smil'd. Grandson, said he, I do conceive, If you had known the world, and how things go, But half as much as you believe, Or twice as much as I believe you know, You would not have complain'd, That dogs behave to one another When they are unchain'd, Like every creature to his brother. Say, dupe of a rash confidence and trust, If you lie open and unguarded, Is it not just, That vigilance should be rewarded? 'Twas neither nature's call, Nor my instruction, To trust your friends at all; Much less, to trust them to your own destruction. A painful and severe attention Is but a necessary fence, To every dog of sense, Against deceit and circumvention, A task from which you hop'd to be reliev'd By trusting to your friends: You are deceiv'd, Acting as much as they for your own ends. All the world knows, That friendship's a mere sound; A sound that hardly can impose Upon a puppy hound. Nature is not to blame, Flatter'd by cunning, indolence invented That foolish name, By which so many fools are circumvented. Happiness you'll seldom find, Unless you learn To have no weighty interest or concern With those of your own kind; Unless you learn (if it is not too late) That they are neither worth your love nor hate. TWO LYRIC EPISTLES: OR, MARGERY THE COOK-MAID TO THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS. I write a sad hand; but my Sister Margery, she writes better. 1762. MARGERY TO THE REVIEWERS. By the backside! good lack, good lack! Chain'd to the chimney corner like a monkey, You are as spiteful as a black, That has been drinking drink for drunky. I think I see my Master leap and skip, And whisk about his tail; Just like a pinnace when she makes a trip, And whisks about her sail. So have I seen a Highlander retire, And turn about to court the wind, Shot by a cinder leaping from the fire Amongst his precious parts behind. Laugh! no, he need not be afraid, Though 'twould be comical, no doubt, To see him squatting like a maid; And making water like a spout. But I should laugh at you Reviewers, If I could view your buttocks bare, Genteelly truss'd and pink'd with skewers, And nicely larded like a Hare. Nay, I could wish To see your backsides sing'd and flead, Just like your favourite dish, A singged hede: To smell them savoury and reeky, Like Cocky Leaky. And as your Cook, at a smith's forge, Gives the fine flavour of the wool To a sheep's skull, Which makes you eat till you regorge; So the communication is so great Between your brains and your backside, Between the seat Of Laziness and seat of Pride, That tho' the brains of all you jokers Never struck fire into a single joke, Yet if your bums were sing'd with pokers, Your brains perhaps, might yield a little smoke; Spite of your heavy jokes, That fall upon the head, Like apoplectic strokes, Or pigs of lead. We'll laugh, to see your Highland sparks, Your Highland breeding, and good manners, To see them strut about the parks, With shirts display'd behind, like banners; Shewing our maids, and modest wives, Such modest sights, As make their husbands weary of their lives: They make them pass such restless nights, Our Lovers sicken and despair, Dejection preys upon our beaux; The expectations of our fair Are rais'd so highly, by such shows. The Indians, I'm told, are more polite, They don't produce their brawny powers, They only shew their powers by candle-light, Amongst their favourite squaws at certain hours. Good Sirs, if I aright can read, You are design'd for books, Just as your friends, beyond the Tweed, For gardeners and cooks. Your pride and laziness, I guess, Disorder and torment your minds, And bring your country to distress, For want of labourers and hinds. I think, like you, it is a shame, That its best blood should now be bleeding; And blame The Government for such proceeding: I would have sent the very worst, I would have sent you all a packing; You should have gone the very first, You're good enough for a good thwacking. But I am weary of inditing Such letters; And so I take my leave of writing; And leave you to my betters. EPISTLE THE SECOND. You who assemble in disguise, And take your stands in secret places, Spitting into our mouths and eyes, With a pretence to wash our faces! But, when you 'spy a Scotchman walking, His air and manner is so pleasing, That you immediately leave hawking, And offer him a pickle of your sneesing. I do not want to rob you of your snuff, Give it your countrymen, it likes me well But do not fright us, like Macduff, Calling aloud, to ring the alarum bell; Suspend your purulence, swallow your spittle, And listen to an Englishman a little. You know you spit at us, and hawk and cough, As if you had a charter; And also know we wipe it meekly off, Like Charles the blessed Martyr. Whilst you go on, abuse, and rail, As if we were not fellow-creatures; Laying about you like a flail, And bruising all our English features; If we poor Englishmen but smile, It is high treason, Tho' we are smiling all the while Both with good nature and good reason; Not throwing dirt at a whole nation According to the Reviewers the greatest pleasure that the whole English nation enjoys, is to see their brethren of North Britain in their theatres represented as a parcel of scoundrels., But laughing at the folly of a few, Whose prejudice and affectation Become them just as they do you; As if they were a chosen race, Clear and exempted, by their birth From all the vices that disgrace All other children of the earth. I very readily excuse Your want of complaisance To my strange Muse, Dress'd in the careless dress of France, A la Fontaine, A slattern, but quite plain. According to your notions, You must dislike the flimsy wench. Her dress and all her motions Are so intolerably French; The Reviewers say that the Verses in the Fables for Grown Gentlemen hobble strangely, from fourteen to two syllables: that may partly be owing to their want of ears; they must have the same objection to Fontaine.A graceless copy of a graceless hobbler, Just like a gouty shoe made by a cobler. You think the bagpipe's notes are sweeter Than any pipe or any string; The Ass preferr'd the Cuckow's song and metre To all the Warblers of the Spring: Either the organs or the soul Of you and Asses are so droll Lyric Epistles to the Reviewers.. Your ignorance and want of Sense, Your want of Ears, I do forgive; But unprovok'd Malevolence I'll never pardon whilst I live; Such your attempt to prove me to the North A foe to its acknowledg'd worth. In every country I despise A heart that's arrogant and narrow, As much as I esteem and prize David Hume and David's marrow. Now to conclude, I am yours Reviewing or Review'd. But as my Fables are not to your liking, Witness the Fable of last year See p. 41., I send you something that's more striking, Concise and clear: I think you call it in your brogue An apologue. THE APOLOGUE. Some folks get no more by their reading And meditations; Than Apes and Monkeys by their breeding And observations: This, I agree, May be applied either to you or me. The Fable that comes after Can only be applied to you; If it excites a little laughter, It answers all my view. An Ape, by trade an imitator, Had spent the best part of his days; Like a Reviewer or Translator Of Farces, Interludes, and Plays; For ever copying, and itching To shew his talents in the kitchen. He would divert you, if you were not nice And difficult to please, By cracking lice, And catching fleas; Which he would chaw, And cram into a kitten's maw. In short, Jacko had studied many a trick, Which tricks, instead of making sport, Would oft'ner make you sick: Yet he would make you, now and then, Laugh like the foolishest of men. The Cook-maid by the fire was fast asleep, No kind of harm suspecting, Jacko, the Ape, was playing at bopeep, Reviewing and reflecting, Whether from liquor or from whim, The Cook-maid laid in a strange trim. Hard-by a razor left upon a chair By Jackanapes was quickly seiz'd. The Cook-maid's beard, expos'd and bare, The grinning villain rubb'd and greas'd; Then snapp'd his fingers and look'd grave; Flourish'd his razor, and began to shave. Jacko proceeded without dread, Chatter'd, and did not care a fig: Poor Margery was hack'd and bled, Like an assassinated Pig. Rous'd by her pains, like frantic sleepers, She snatch'd a pan of boiling broth, Bubbling and running o'er with froth, And threw it into Jacko's peepers; Which blinded him, and spoil'd him past all cure, Both for a Shaver and Reviewer. A PASTORAL CORDIAL, OR, AN ANODYNE SERMON: PREACHED BEFORE Their Graces Newcastle and Devonshire, In the Country. by an independent Teacher of the Truth. ?????? ?? ????? ???????? ???? ??? ??????? ????. Homer. 1763. THIS ANODYNE METRE IS DEDICATED, WITH PROFOUND RESPECT, BY THE INDEPENDENT PREACHER, TO THE MOST INGENIOUS ACADEMY OF BELLES LETTRES. The battle is not to the strong; Nor to the swift of foot the race: But time and chance to all belong, Whether they're in or out of place. I shall so handle, by God's blessing, The subject-matter of my text, That you will soon grow tired of guessing What I propose to offer next; An art, if studied with some care, Which in its object seldom fails, And, though first practis'd on the Fair, Succeeds as often with the males. By means of this sublime invention, Many an Orator and Clerk, Eluding the most strict attention, Has woo'd and won you in the dark. The head and heart are often ta'en, Like other fortresses, by storm; Some cannot stand a coup de main, That would hold out a siege in form. Inspired Cromwell and Sir Harry Sir Harry Vane., Like eagles mounting in their flight, Would never stoop to strike their quarry, Till both were lost and out of sight: Despising rules above all plan, Borne on the wings of prayer and praise, Bursting into the inward man, They set the spirit in a blaze; Which, by the outward man's assistance, Serv'd for a beacon to the godly, And kept the Devil at a distance, He look'd so fierce, and talk'd so oddly. I hate to wander very wide; A skilful orator proceeds, Like modest folks that step aside Only when forc'd to do their needs. So Senators by antient use, When they no longer can contain, Just step aside to spirt abuse, And to their text return again. The battle is not to the strong, The race is sometimes to the lame; 'Tis neither strength, nor right nor wrong, Nor skill; 'tis Chance that wins the game. We see you're worsted in the battle; There yet arises a dispute, Which may be difficult to settle, Who is the weaker, you or Bute? Taking it either way for granted, If you are out, and he is in, There's still a point to be descanted; Whether it signifies a pin: Then for your Graces and each Whig, Another point requires some thought, Whether you both are worth a fig; Or all your party worth a groat. These points discuss'd, and fairly tried, The rest in order will succeed; Drawn out, display'd, and ramify'd, Like pedigrees, or like a creed. First, then, I'll shew that you are weaker; So weak and washy that you may be, By any weak and washy speaker, Prov'd to be weaker than a baby. Weakness is of a two-fold kind, And is of different degrees, Either of body or of mind; Explain'd by acts that flow from these; That from the mind and body flow Like torrents, oft with ostentation; But those that know them also know, How soon they're dry, ev'n to privation. How soon the Bully's race is run! How soon his impotence descry'd! How soon the simple Maid's undone That trusts her Virtue to her Pride! How soon that eloquence so rapid, Whipt to verbosity and froth, Subsides, and grows tasteless and vapid, And innocent as chicken broth! Like a young Puppy forc'd to clamber, Slipping and struggling up a stile, I once got to a levee chamber, And was embarrass'd for a while; The dog finds footing at the top, He wags his tail, and cocks his eye, Before he leaps, he makes a stop, And makes remarks; and so did I. I shou'd have wept, but by good luck, Instead of being melancholy, I laugh'd to see so many struck With imbecillity and folly; To see so many as one finds; So many, with the greatest names, Entangled in the weakest minds, And the most despicable frames. I pitch'd on one, whom I affirm To be a perfect scale or model, To try a body that's infirm, Or mark the weakness of a noddle. I saw the phantom enter in; He look'd as if he came to fright us; Dancing with a palsied grin, The dance according to St. Vitus. A ring was form'd; with starts and catches, He scuttled round and round within it, Just like the pointers of some watches, That point the seconds of a minute. His eyes were void of speculation, His nerves, entirely void of feeling, His tongue was made for hesitation, His legs were only made for reeling. How should an Olive Chaplet twine Round so ridiculous a Wig? How should such shoulders, such a chine, Produce one single Olive Twig It is an observation founded upon experience, that the same qualifications that enable a man to go through the office of a domestic peace-maker will frequently, especially in some of our Northern courts, make an able and a successful negotiator.? Do but apply, 'twill save much trouble, This model, for your own diversion; If Bute's not stronger more than double, Mine was an impudent assertion. Though one of you, in his first stage, Made an athletic mobbish figure, When did he shew, at any age, Any other kind of vigour? Your rival's vigour and address, At such an age, such strength and fire, Such a continuance of success Many folks envy; I admire. Not to insist upon this longer, For it can only teaze and vex, He is allow'd to be the stronger By the best judges in each sex. I see you'll wave this point at length, Perhaps such glory you despise; Perhaps you place your greatest strength Upon the strength of your allies. Ye sons of Vice and vain designs, What heat, what force, can you impart, Tied by the bonds of dice and quinze, And the loose follies of the heart? A union deriv'd from pelf, Where each contributes his whole labour, Each only working for himself, Leaves his engagements to his neighbour; Like those machines, absurd and puzzling, Where no one spring controuls the rest, All independent and all bustling, As if they acted for the best; Like an alliance with the Tartars, They hurt your friends more than your foes; To keep them out of one's own quarters, Is all the good one can propose. Such troops must fly from you and ruin, Driven by an instinctive force, Like Wild Geese, when a storm is brewing, Flying o'er Newmarket Course. Your happy rival's powers behold, United like the Theban band, By Love, but not the love of gold, Nor any Love I understand. The men of Cocoa take the lead, Not for their enmity to Pit, Nor for the love they bear the Tweed, Nor for their Valour, nor their Wit; Nor for their Loyalty, in brief, Which they have very lately slipt on; But for their faith, and firm belief In second sight Some Refiners pretend, that by Second Sight is meant that pertinacity with which the Cocobites, like the Jews, are constantly looking for a second Redeemer or Messiah; and that their faith in mother Shipton means their zealous attachment to the church, that is, to the old infallible church, whose infallibility is founded upon anility; a term used by schoolmen for the most perfect kind of tradition; for tradition derived from the most remote age, which is dotage., and mother Shipton. Inflam'd with wine they scour the fields, Than any Bacchanalians madder, With quaint devices on their shields, Jacob's staff, and Jacob's ladder. Obedient, inur'd to toils, Their Northern brethren next appear, Big with the prospect of your spoils, His exil'd forces close the rear. Pride is hateful in Heaven's sight, But vanity it must forgive; Without it, none would ever write; And many would not bear to live. Vanity soon begins to droop, Snubb'd by the slightest opposition; But stubborn pride will neither stoop To Heaven, nor the Inquisition. If any pride be lurking here, Of which I harbour no belief, Whether a Commoner or Peer, I give him up to endless grief. Such imputation on your Graces Admits no shadow of pretence; You both have acted in all cases, Divested of that sinful sense. To such as you I mean to speak, My preaching has no other scope, To the poor-spirited and meek, They shall find comfort and sure hope. Lest vanity upon the road Should draw you in to a relapse, I must still urge you with my goad, And give you mortifying raps. Of mental strength next I shall treat, The vulgar claim so great a share, 'Tis of less value with the great, Though not less worthy of their care: For, by the help of thy firm stuff, The vulgar, now and then, no doubt, Contrive to do things well enough; Almost as well as you without. Some minds are active, fiery, bold; Some to neutrality inclin'd; Others are timorous and cold, Totally passive and resign'd. The first is like a zealot preaching; The neutral like a rosy Dean; The passive like a curate teaching, Hungry and weary, poor and lean: Or like a cuckold doom'd by fate To rise when his lieutenant knocks, And give up both his bed and mate, As if he kept a play-house box: Or like some governments we know, The first, a monarch to a tittle; The neutral serves to make a shew; The passive serves for very little. Lastly, the first in many senses Is like his Lordship with his hounds, Breaking down every body's fences, Riding in every body's grounds; All things obey his Lordship's beck; All yield to his superior skill, His poor toad-eater breaks his neck, Compell'd to leap against his will. As for these three which we have reckon'd, Your Graces evermore possess'd Less of the first than of the second; More of the third than all the rest. The active principle within Produces sometimes on the brain A rage and violence like gin, Sometimes a spirit, like Champaigne. O Hollis, once, but seldom since, You felt that flame when you withstood, And sent a challenge to a Prince, To fight for an old Lady's Hood Chancellorship of Cambridge, which he carried against the late Prince of Wales.; Spite of that Prince's opposition, The hood was won, in triumph led, And from that time your chief ambition Has been to wear it on your head. In short, the mental powers of late You've by degrees so melted down, They only serv'd like your gold plate, To do the honours of the crown. The powers in which you are most able, In which you both have always shone, Have small weight at a council table, Or any tables but your own. One may be forc'd to use their aid; But these, indeed, are times of need, Just as one's forc'd to ride a Jade, Though she has neither wind nor speed: If you bait oft, if you rise soon, If when she's staling you'll attend, And nap not in the afternoon, She'll bring you to your journey's end. Your Graces should have been inclin'd To move like planets in your places; To plodding, one have been confin'd; One to the circle of grimaces. I mean oblig'd only to plod, To plod and not to understand; No more oblig'd than a white rod Is bound to be a Conjuror's wand. A thing design'd to catch the eye, That knows no other end or trick; All that is signify'd thereby Is nothing more than a white stick. 'Tis borne by Chamberlains and Shrieves, But why, I can no more explain, Than why a Bishop wears lawn sleeves, Or why a page must bear his train; Or why Archbishops should not rather Give up to God with one accord, The title of Most Reverend Father The title of Most Reverend Father is impious. Surely God the Father is the Father the most worthy of Reverence. As to the title of a Spiritual Lord, I see no inconvenience in their assuming it; at least, like your Grace or your Worship, it implies no impiety; it only implies nonsense. Where is the sense of a Spiritual Lord, or a Heavenly Lord? All the lords that we know are either British lords or Irish lords: carnal, substantial, and Terra Firma Lords., And be content with that of Lord. Why Kings, that are such precious things, Are made, like us, of flesh and bones; Instead of making them like rings, Nothing but gold and precious stones. Or why it is esteem'd so hard To fall into some lady's clutches, That a red ribbon's the reward For venturing to wed a Duchess. Your rival's parts I will not mention; And yet, to give him but his due, There's no occasion for invention To prove that he has more than you. Great parts are oft expos'd to laughter; To wickedness are oft ally'd, Those are best off here and hereafter, That have no more than they can guide. You are the foremost of the latter, Be satisfied, no more contend, And I foresee; I do not flatter, You'll make a sweeter latter end. Your rival having made his push, And kick'd you out without remorse, Whether it signifies a rush, Is the next part of my discourse. If you are treated ill and put on, 'Tis natural to make a fuss; To see it and not care a button, Is just as natural for us. Perhaps from men of greater Fashion Greater professions you may draw, You may extract all their compassion, The extract is not worth a straw. Like people viewing at a distance Two persons thrown out of a casement, All we can do for your assistance Is to afford you our amazement. We see men thrown from a high story, And never think the sight's so odd, Whether the patient's Whig or Tory, But take things as it pleases God. For an impartial looker on, In such disasters never chuses; 'Tis neither Tom, nor Will, nor John; 'Tis the phænomenon amuses. In Holland thus, Peter the Great, Wanting to see a live dissection, Bid them take any of his suite, To be cut up for his inspection. He car'd not where the choice might fall, Of persons he was no respecter, He would have parted with them all For such an edifying lecture. In characters like his complete, No partial preferences strike, Like him great monarchs ought to treat Their loving subjects all alike. Whilst such an enmity endures, Bones must be broken, heads must ake, We had as lief they should be yours, As any others for your sake. Sermons, especially of late, Like most Narcoticks, are too heady; They sink you with a deadly weight, Unless you have sharp acids ready. If this should be too sharp and biting, I do protest 'tis my mistake; I have no thoughts at all of spiteing; I only want to keep you awake. I must entreat you not to doze, Keep a good watch over your heads; At night you'll find that your repose Will be more pleasant in your beds. I find your Graces hope for favour, And dream of popular applause; For a most regular behaviour, A strict conformity to laws. And you insinuate, your rival Has tenets hurtful to the state; That all his aim is the revival Of every tenet that we hate. But if his interest's the same, As it's the same with yours in fact, When he's pursuing the same game, You need not tell us how he'll act. Like you, entrusted with his purse, Why should he, when he knows his trim, Exchange his master for a worse? I only mean a worse for him. Like you he may grow so refin'd, When all his intellects are purg'd, To think that Princes were design'd, Not for a scourge, but to be scourg'd: If he has been a friend to learning, And early plighted her his troth, Like you he may grow more discerning, Like you he may become a Goth. Pray, where's the mighty obligation, For leaving matters as you found them? Is it because of the temptation, When they're well settled, to confound them? You are no Jacobite I ween; You have despis'd them from a boy; Just as a Chinese Mandarine, Despises a poor Talapoi The Talapois are a sect of Indian Philosophers, whose system of happiness runs upon four wheels: Idleness, Ignorance, Obstinacy, and Beggary. Your lives, your wealth, for which I'm troubled, In the Court's service have been spent: The more fools you, both to be bubbled, And damn'd, unless you well repent. What's that to us? must we the rabble All fall together by the ears For an uninteresting squabble, Amongst you interested Peers! Why should we run and heat our blood, And be stirr'd up to an alarm, For men that cannot do us good And dare not do us any harm? You've heard the words of an old song, A wiser than the song of songs, That certain folks can do no wrong; Others must answer for their wrongs. Were I to answer for another, Both drunk and sober, sad and gay, Even if 'twas for my own brother, I'd think on't often in a day. If this has sometimes made you pale, And made the sweat run down your phiz, Why should we think that it can fail To have the same effect on his? Your Graces are deceiv'd no less, In our opinion of the skill Requir'd for charges, which we guess Any one of us could fill. Though some may rate your science high, 'Tis all pretension and parade, To a judicious stander-by Your skill and science is a trade. But not to mention your fine measures, When was such folly ever known, To trust one with the nation's treasures, That can't be trusted with his own? Must it not always be in straits, For ever growing worse and worse; For ever pledg'd like your estates, Like them for ever sent to nurse? From such opinions you'll conclude, That, far from wond'ring at your parts, We all conceive ourselves endu'd With as much skill, and as good hearts. My thoughts of Government, though vain, Are singular and entertaining: How many parts it may contain, And what they're like, is worth explaining. They're three, and each like a wild beast: The first to a lion I compare; The next a tiger from the East; The third is like an Alpine bear. The former with sheeps heads are fed, Flesh is best suited to their maws; The bear will live upon rye bread, And on the suckings of his paws; Bruin's not nice about his food, But very fond of fun and play, He's neither covetous of blood, Nor sullen like those beasts of prey. Suppose them thrust into one den, Carefully manag'd and observ'd By any of those vulgar men By whom such animals are serv'd; To keep their union entire, They must be brought up all together; And, if they're fed as they require, They may be govern'd by a feather. But, should their keeper without scruple, Let out his Lion in a crowd, Neither th' excuses of the pupil Or governor will be allow'd. They'll send the Tutor for his frolick (Shooting his Pupil in their rage), To lie like Quixote in the cholick, Stinking in an enchanted cage. 'Tis all the same, Tiger or Lion, It would have been as bad a job; The Bear was safer to rely on, The Bear's a favourite of the mob. I hope your Graces at last see, That we, who never taste your feasts, Care little whether you or he Have the direction of the beasts. Your value has been fairly stated; Nothing remains but to enquire, Whether your party can be rated, With any reason, any higher. Like the physicians of the college, Or the physicians of the soul, The Whigs, with greater zeal than knowledge Would fain prescribe without controul. Princes must bow to their decrees, None of their fancies be neglected, Their dreams, like Saxe's reveries, Must both be study'd and respected. If dreamers must reform the state, If dreamers are to be the strongest, Those ought to have the greatest weight, That have continued to dream longest. Yours are the latest and the newest, And therefore I infer with truth, Those are the strongest and the truest That have been dreamers from their youth. 'Twill also follow from this view, That all your schemes must come to nought; That neither you, nor your whole crew, Are all together worth a groat. Say then, who are the strongest dreamers? They who for ever have been croaking; Whose dreams occasion sweats and tremors, Convulsions, strangling, and choaking? Those dreamers, Cocoa, are thy sons, Entranc'd in visions half an age; That come at last in swarms like Huns, And drive the Whigs quite off the stage, Oblig'd to seek, like routed bees, A shelter for their wretched lives, In dreary vales and hollow trees, Far from St. James's honey'd hives. Here I'll give you a resting place, The only place in my disposal; People in your neglected case Ought to be glad of the proposal. It is a Sinecure complete, Which for your lives I'll let you keep; Nothing to do but drink and eat, To shave, repent, and go to sleep. All your miscarriages arise, In spite of all that you advance, From your pretending to be wise, And not depending upon Chance. When did Chance fail you at a pinch? How many times, you know full well, When you durst hardly ask an inch, Has not she given you an ell? How many years, to our surprize, When foes oppos'd you without number, Subsidies, Armies, Fleets, Supplies, Kept rolling on in one smooth slumber? By Time and Chance at first you rose, By Time and Chance at last you fall; They humble you, and raise your foes, For Time and Chance happen to all. Be therefore patient and resign'd, To Time and Chance alone attend; Trust not yourselves in any kind; You cannot trust a weaker friend. The battle is not to the strong, Nor have the weak always prevail'd; If they succeeded all along, Your Graces never could have fail'd. You're us'd to Sermons better dress'd, But exercise, and country air, Will help your Graces to digest My coarse, but not unwholesome, fare. And may the peace of God enlighten, And set your hearts and minds at rest! And may you evermore delight in A snug and comfortable nest! And that which you could have no hand in, The peace of Bute, upon you shine; A peace above your understanding, As much as yours was above mine. QUERIES TO THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS. Ye judging Caledonian Pedlars, That to a scribbling world give law Laid up engarretted, like Medlars, Ripening asperity in straw! Ye Guardians of the Tree of Folly, The Cocoa-Tree Rabelais speaks with great respect of this tree, Book iii. Chap. li. Page 351. translated by Ozell, “If the worth and Virtue thereof, says he, had been known, when those trees, by the relation of the prophet, made election of a wooden king to rule and govern over them, it without all doubt would have carried away from all the rest, the plurality of votes and suffrages.”, whose leaves are clad In green eternal, like the Holly, Variegated like a plaid, On which a flower perennial grows, Worn at the Cocobittick Games, Between a Lilly and a Rose, Inscrib'd with silly royal names Nascantur flores, et Phyllida solus habeto!! I come, with no felonious hand, To steal one blossom from your tree; Right well I know, and understand, It was not planted there for me. I come to ask you a few questions: Why should a hodge-podge make you queasy, You who for crowdys have digestions, On whom e'en haggesses sit easy? I come to ask why the sublime Delights to dwell under Scotch bonnets? Why Humour, Wit, Poetic Rhyme, Are only found in Scottish sonnets? And if in Scotland they are found, And any one pleases to shew them, Either above, or under ground, To lay you odds you will not know them. Also to ask you one word more: What makes the Tories, your good masters, As restless, feverish, and sore, As people wrapt in blistering plasters? Whether 'tis true that they're so tender, And apt of late to take things ill, Because their friend, the old Pretender, Has struck them out of his last will? Whether 'tis true, or a Whig fiction, That shoals of exiles now at Calais, Will fill up the Whig dereliction, And fill up all St. James's palace? If you will tell us this sincerely, The cordial preacher and adviser Will make you understand him clearly, And, though no better, make you wiser. POSTSCRIPT.

Master of dedication sweet, Renown'd Translator of Translations, That, like old clothes in Monmouth-street, Display their glittering temptations— You are so us'd to a Northern trammel You cannot enter into Lyric Fable; One might as well expect to see a camel Pass through a needle's eye into a stable: And therefore I am forc'd to study To find out something you can understand, Pleasant and fresh, though somewhat muddy; Just like the mug of porter in your hand. And yet, when all is said and done, This something's nothing but a Pun. A PUN.

A SECOND SERMON PREACHED BEFORE THE PEOPLE CALLED WHIGS. BY AN INDEPENDENT. ????????, ?? ???? ?? ????????, ? ?????????.. Hom. We fear, in as much as we are in doubt, whether we shall be saved or perish. Affatim est hominum, in dies qui singulas Escas edunt, Quibus negotii nihil est, qui esum neque vocantur neque vocari, Eos oportet concioni dare operam. Plautus Menechmi. 1764.The date of 1764 shews the occasion: upon the dismission of the Whigs, after trying all kinds of trimming tricks to make themselves acceptable to no purpose. Author.Text, Rev. chap. III. ver. 15, 16, 17. “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. “So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth: “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.” I know full well your works of old, That you are neither cold nor hot; Would you were either hot or cold, Your works of old should be forgot. You're lukewarm all, you have no worth; Your ways are crooked and uncouth, And therefore I will cast you forth, And spew you all out of my mouth; Because you say, that you are priz'd, Are powerful, and in Plenty roll; And know not, that you are despis'd, Naked, and blinder than a Mole. One need not be a deep divine, Nor many mystic books inspect, To shew, these words plainly design The trimming Tepidarean Sect; Neither of Zeno's rigid school, Nor Pleasure's school of non-resistance; But of the school of an old fool, That doubts even his own existence; A wav'ring quibbling sect contriv'd, To free the Mind from all precision, Indoctrinated, and reviv'd, By Hollis Chancellor of Cambridge. the Academician. A sect that creeps into most states, That ev'ry man of spirit damns; And ev'ry honest woman hates, For their unsteadiness and shams. By whom all Princes are betray'd, All noble projects are defeated, And ev'ry widow, wife, and maid, Are tantaliz'd, abus'd and cheated. Like Hussars they seem always ready; But, when the danger's within reach, They neither in the field stand steady, Nor in the trenches, nor the breach. As Folly's not their greatest fault, Thro' dirtier paths than hers they've trudg'd, You may observe, if you will halt, How mercifully they are judg'd. No Fines, no Prison—Tribulation, No Loss of Members, to afflict them, Only for qualms which they occasion, Spew'd out like Vinum Benedictum. Or, to come nearer to the matter, When acid crudities rebuke, Taken and swallow'd like warm water On purpose to provoke a puke. So some of you were for a season, When your sour brethren caus'd great pain, Swallow'd, for no other reason Than to disgorge you both again. Better discharge the peccant acid, For, tho' their mixture should create A Neutral, innocent and placid; A Neutral's always a dead weight. Better to clear them both away, Than leave them wambling in the guts, Windy and Rapin tells us, that the Scotch first of all called them Whigs, from Whig, a liquor in that country, which he translates Lait Aigre, Sour Milk or Butter Milk. But he is mistaken, as Mr. Johnson judiciously observes in his distinction of the word Whig into its simple and figurative sense. 1. Whig—Whey. 2. A Faction. See Johnson's Dictionary in Whig. I cannot forbear in this place acknowledging the obligation we are under to Mr. Johnson, for extending the benefits of the Union to the two languages. I hope in the next edition he will be able to lay aside invidious distinctions, and make a complete British Dictionary. flatulent as whey, And indigestible as nuts. I've run the metaphor quite through, And taken as much pains as ten men, To shew how beautifully true The figures are of sacred penmen. And now the Trimmer shall be try'd, If guilty, by St. John's decision, Let an emetick be apply'd, Let him be spew'd out with derision. First then I'll search, nay, never wince, The Trimmer's conduct quite thro' life To God, his Country, and his Prince, His Neighbour, Family, and Wife. Then by my text, in all these cases, You'll see their condemnation seal'd; And see, they ought to lose their places, Although it had not been reveal'd. Concerning Heaven, and Heaven's Vicegerent, I'll touch upon the first but slightly; Yet they are subjects so coherent, One cannot separate them rightly. G?d and the K?g, we're told, are jealous, Tho' none can do them any harm; Which must make pious people zealous, And loyal people very warm. We see enough in a dim light To love and honour these high powers, With all our hearts and all our might, Both for their own sakes and for ours. We can do them no good, we know; But, they can punish us, you own, Therefore our thanks at least we owe, Ev'n for letting us alone. Instead of seasonable weather, If we had always snow and hail; Or wooden shoes instead of leather; Or vinegar instead of ale; If we were worn to skin and bone, Driven and beaten like an Ass, For Bread presented with a Stone, And for roast Beef a little Grass; As Fortune's not in our disposal, We ought, instead of taking pet, To make the best of the proposal, If 'tis the best that we can get. Things take this course in many a land; In many more may be appointed, They come like earthquakes out of hand, If it please G?d and G?d's anointed. What could we either do or say? Why should we pout, and shew our malice? Rather why should not we be gay, Like Frenchmen dancing in the gallies? This is the argument in France, “'Tis not the worst that cou'd arrive; “We have sufficient cause to dance, “Because we are not flea'd alive.” Reasons as fine as head can spin, I from the Stoick school could quote, To prove that pulling off your skin Is just like pulling off your coat. But as the Cynick left his stool, To confute those that deny'd motion, These of the Gally-Gallick school, Dance to confute the Stoick's Notion. How diff'rent is your fate from theirs! For you are fill'd with all good things; Without petitioning or prayers, Either to Heaven or your kings: That they confide in your intentions, From their forbearance you may draw, Heav'n leaves you to your own inventions, And the K?g leaves you to the law. In holy zeal and loyal duty, The Whigs fall short, I own with grief, Of holiness the greatest beauty; The Church's toast's a Tory Chief. Whilst like a Highland Chief intrepid, He sticks at nought for the good cause; The Trimmer moves on dull and tepid, Like muggy weather when it thaws. All his devotion's faint and flat, He looks at court, ev'n in the ring, Just as indiff'rent as a cat, When a cat's looking at a King St. John of Patmos tells a story See Revelations, chap.x. Lord S?h, a pretended Whig in the former reign, and suspected in this, could not give a more effectual proof of his conversion and unconditional submission than accepting the task of persecuting and betraying the champion of the Whigs in his famous accusation of Wilkes for blasphemy and profaneness., When he was there on his devotions: I do believe he was a Tory, He is so warm in all his notions. An angel, that was standing by, And heard the zeal that John profess'd, Conceiving doubts, resolv'd to try, And put his mettle to the test He had been watching there incog, And could not think he was sincere, John was so ill-a-looking dog, With so insidious a leer. The angel suddenly display'd His plumage, bright with heav'nly lights, John seem'd not in the least dismay'd, He was accustom'd to such sights. John, said the angel, by your mien I know your wants, before you speak, You look as hungry and as lean, As if you fasted for a week. Why crawl upon your knees, and flatter, Sing Psalms and Hymns, and pray and watch? A Psalm, by way of growing fatter, Has no more virtue than a catch. Behold, I bring you a great treat, Why don't you say so, when you're needy? Restorative and juicy meat, So take your time, and be not greedy. Eat, said the angel, never spare, And tell me how you like the cook: Would you believe? the angel's fare Was nothing but a little book. There's one that's better taught then fed; That trimming rogue will in a trice Eat it all up, I'll lay my head, Just like a sandwich, slice by slice. Well hast thou done, the angel cry'd, Of thee there is no farther question; For thy obedience has been try'd, And yields to nought but thy digestion. This is a type, and a true symbol, Of unconditional submission, To rouse you like a brazen tymbal, From a lethargic opposition; To arm yourselves with faith completely, On shuffling doubts boldly to trample, In every point submitting meetly, And following St. John's example. What had he gain'd by unbelief? Could not an angel, if he would, Change a book either into beef, Or into any kind of food? If John had doubted but in thought, The angel might have been provok'd; He might have cramm'd it down his throat, And John perhaps might have been choak'd Whereas by taking it for granted, And by his dutiful behaviour, John fill'd his belly, which he wanted, And eat himself into great favour I should be glad, in such a case, To see a Whig, how he'd behave; And to behold a Trimmer's face, How he would set about to shave The Whig would view the book with rage, To see him would divert the Trimmer, He would not eat a single page, Tho' 'twas no bigger than a primer. A little book! and what of that? I will not swallow it I swear, 'Tis against Magna Charta flat, As Serjeant Glynn and Lord Camden. Glynn and Pratt will both declare. Eat it! by all that's good not I, Be it no bigger than a pill; I'll tell you how far I'll comply, My breech may eat it, if it will. The Trimmer would appear reserv'd, And beg to be allow'd to speak; That every one must have observ'd His stomach was but very weak; His Faith was strong as heart could wish, And he believ'd the book inspir'd; That he would vote it Flesh or Fish, Or vote it both, if 'twas requir'd. Like Dutchmen, positive and bold, The Whigs are a rude, churlish faction; Tho' naturally slow and cold, They may be work'd up into action. Like Mules, not apt to lose their feet, Oe'r precipices safe and able; A Trimmer is that made-up cheat, A horse out of a dealer's stable. The first their views confin'd by blinds, By bells amus'd, and kept from sleeping, May be made serviceable Hinds; The latter will not pay their keeping. O for a Tory generation! Generous hunters, true-bred Racers! Even a mulish congregation Is better than these trimming pacers. We'll now examine other facts, And try, whether we can deduce From any of the Trimmer's acts, That he's of any kind of use. But to proceed by that strict plan To which both you and I are ty'd, His country's the next point to scan, And how he serves it, you'll decide. Before folks talk of being firm, And dying for their Country's good, It would be proper that the term, Our Country, should be understood. Country's a general term; like Wine, Implying various kinds of drink; 'Tis not so easy to define, As some unthinking people think. Wine with the Chaplain stands for Port; French Wines the Patriots veins replenish; Tokay, perhaps, means Wine at Court; Perhaps Wine there means nought but Rhenish. Give us our daily Bread, we pray; For this we pray, and we pray right: But, though we say all the same way, Some mean brown bread, and some mean white. Others extend it beyond bounds, Terms are so difficult to fix; The Squire takes in his pack of hounds, His Wife includes her coach and six. So Country in different climes Has many various acceptations; The sense oft varies with the times, And oftener with situations. The Swiss, that sell their blood and bones, By Country mean all states, not poor; In Rome a land of monks and drones, The paramours of the scarlet whore. In Portugal 'tis fire and faggot, In France a Salique constitution; In England quite an English maggot, Country means there the Revolution. If every Englishman on earth Be for a Revolution hearty, Must not the Whigs excite one's mirth, When they confine it to their party? Whilst theirs seems to be plann'd in spite, Exclusive, like the Irish pale, The Revolution Cocobite Plans his upon the largest scale. Try then the Trimmer by some plan, By either of the Revolutions, The Trimmer's still the lukewarm man, Always for tepid constitutions. The Country that some Tories mention, For which they combat tooth and nail, Is but a country of invention, Like Plato's or a Fairy Tale. “When righteous Magi fill the throne, “Say they, and yet they're not in jest, “That, which depends on one alone, “Of all Countries is the best.” Grant the first step, 'tis all they need, The schools will prove by rules of art That Caco-Magus, so called, some people fancy from ?????. I wish it had been so, this passage of my sermon would have been more brilliant on that account, by the opposition of an evil Magus to a righteous one; but I will not hunt for glory at the expence of truth, whatever (encouraged by the example of my betters) I may do for profit. I am therefore obliged to confess, that he was called Caco-Magus, a Cacando, a habit of body, that he contracted by the terrors incident to those kinds of studies in which he was engaged his whole life. Caco-Magus was a successor of Simon Magus, whose tenets he maintained in a book that he wrote, called Dæmonology. —The manuscript of which book is still extant amongst the invaluable curiosities of the Bodleian Collection. Caco-Magus, and his seed, Where monarchs after G?d's own heart. Naturalists will undertake To shew by arguments of force, That, from the nature of his make, An unicorn excels a horse. Besides the advantages of strength, Of swiftness and acuter sense, He has a horn of mighty length, Both for attacking and defence. This point you'll probably dispute, Not give up readily at least, A generous and useful brute, For an unprofitable beast. If you keep wrangling, I can't tell How long such a dispute may last; But at the last I know full well, You and your horse will both stick fast. Keep to one point, or by and by You'll give up all, if he persists, Your only way is to deny That such an animal exists. So in that proposition quoted, “When just and righteous Magi reign,” You'll be out-talk'd, and far out-voted, If you will talk in their own strain One weighty word, when they're most stiff, Knocks down absurd and noisy men, The Spartans silenced them with if, And you may silence them with when. My Tory is not such a sot, As he'll convince you more and more, That is, when you are gone to pot, When you're spew'd out, but not before. Don't you remember Lady Anne, How he ador'd her for a time, And how his love at first began Long after she was past her prime? Did not he now protest and swear, And call'd to witness Gods and men? Then was not Anna all his care? What country did he care for then? Yet when he got his wicked will, How often did he wish her dead! How often try'd his utmost skill To get another in her stead! From this you cannot well infer, That my good friend was false or knavish; For to be always ty'd to her, And always courting, was too slavish. It is high time to view the Trimmer In his relation to his neighbour, Where in one sense he's like a swimmer, That swims with constant fear and labour. In limpid shallow pools he keeps, But, if by chance he be mistaken, And plunge sometimes into the deeps, His skill sometimes may save his bacon. Suppose his friend, by following him, Plunges into the same mistake, Although he knows his friend can't swim He'll hazard nothing for his sake. Nay, though arriv'd just to the brink, Deaf to remorse, pity, and pride, He'll see him struggle till he sink, And see him perish by his side. Who in this picture can't behold, If he has feeling, and attends, Poor Wilkes, too credulous and bold, Deserted by his trimming friends? Suppose a Tory leads a brother Into much such another scrape; I only mean much such another, As to the suffocating shape. Let any of you for a while Fancy himself this leading Tory, Practis'd in every Tory wile, Up to the ears in love with glory; You shall face death with as much ease As Philip's son that's dead and gone, So chuse what Tory friend you please, Or, for the pun's sake, chuse Sir John. Would you leave Sir John Phillips so, Dangling for carrion birds to batten? No, though to heaven you would not go With Wilkes, you'd go with him to Satan. Even the Whigs, that do disclaim, And look on Friendship as a sin, Have always felt a little shame For leaving those, that they draw in. Insensible they are and dry, Yet I don't doubt but it would shock, And wring a tear from a Whig's eye, To see Pratt's head upon a block. You'll say, I know, what do you prove? Nothing at all, as yet we hope, But that, like you, we're not in love Either with drowning or a rope. Ah! wriggling rogues, I'll hold you fast, Spite of your twists and slippery tails; Wriggling is out of date and past, Now nought but downright strength prevails. But for this once my hold I'll loose, I'll grant, you're not oblig'd to dive, Nor run your necks into a noose For any friend dead or alive. But will it follow, or be granted, That you are active, warm, or brisk, Ready, whenever you are wanted, When there is neither harm nor risque? This is the least that ought to follow, Yet those that try'd you, have confest, That for the most part you are hollow, Lukewarm and languid at the best. How often have you caught the Whigs Too cold to bite, like many others! How often have the city-prigs Taken, ye Whigs, and you for brothers! By you was artless Holland bubbled, And the Three Virtues Formerly there were more Virtues; but it has been thought proper of late to reduce them to the number of the Graces. The Three Virtues now established are Oeconomy, Temperance, and Chastity. They are believed to be sufficient for all wise purposes, and certainly are as many as we can well manage. I have seen a medal, upon the reverse of which are these Three Virtues in a Bas-relief placed over the gate-way of a Gothic building: they are dancing, and linked hand in hand; but not naked like the Graces; for Virtue should not be ostentatious. There is also this difference between them, that the figures of the Virtues are bold and masculine, it being as necessary to represent Virtue in the character of Vigour and Activity, as to represent Grace in the Character of elegance and softness. Over their heads are these three letters H. S. G. which I am told signify, Hic Sitæ Gaudent, a legend, that seems to be borrowed from the inscription over her Majesty's house, Hic Siti Lætantur Lares. Though the board of works has thought proper to pull down that inscription, yet we see no reason why the Lares may not be as merry now as in the late possessor's time. basely trick'd, Jure Divino sorely troubled, And all the Tories fairly nick'd. Relying on your treacherous aid, Their certain ruin we foresaw, Happ'ly your malice was delay'd By Fabius, and his Fabian law. And after this can you suppose, That all your lukewarm tribe remaining Will not be forc'd with the next dose To come away without much straining? It makes the tears run down my cheeks, When I contemplate or but mention, And contrast with a Trimmer's freaks, A Tory's friendship and attention. There is not one but does comply With Horace's kind invitation To view his friend, not like a spy, But with a lover's fascination; That does not, like th' enamour'd swain, Hang on each blemish a love-knot, Believe and fervently maintain A wen to be a beauty spot. Be his friend heavier than lead, His thoughts are deep, tho' not quite clear, He has a calculating head, Trade or the Treasury's his sphere. If he's absurd, loud, and loquacious, Let him but speak, he'll be in vogue, His eloquence, far from ungracious, Is but a kind of mental brogue; An eloquence, that wants a name, But may have some affinity; For what we know may be the same With Livy's Patavinity. If he's a sneaking, servile wight, His gentle nature wins their hearts, If he can neither read nor write, He trusts with justice to his parts. Accordingly when you're disgrac'd, When they enjoy what you enjoy'd, Every Tory will be plac'd Just as he ought to be employ'd. The secretaries, you are sure, Active and drudging like two diggers, And for the Treasury, they'll procure Men that shall make prodigious figures. From owl-light, led through dubious ways, Worse than in utter darkness cast, We shall emerge into bright days, And go on swimmingly at last. But not to lengthen out the sessions, His wife and family come next, For whom his tenderest impressions Are still, according to my text. Children, he thinks no more in fact, Than debts of nature's imposition; Wives are those debts that we contract, In spite of nature's admonition. Therefore he'd grieve no more to see All of them in their coffins laid, Than you to see your mortgagee Give up your deeds, with all debts paid. What must needs follow you'll conceive, That neither would his wife grow thinner, His son complain, or daughter grieve, To see him give the crows a dinner. Two rosy cheeks do not make health, Nor gold and silver make folks wealthy; Some without either have great wealth, And with unhealthful looks are healthy. Dine with the Trimmer at his villa, And after sup with him in town, You cannot well suppose his pillow Is stuff'd with any thing but down: Especially if you consider His Wife's not there to make it harder; 'Twould avail little to forbid her, Therefore the Trimmer shall discard her. Tully A ducendâ uxore sic abhorret, ut libero Lectulo neget esse quidquam jucundius—Speaking of his brother, after he had parted with his wife, sister to the famous Trimmer Atticus. Ep. ad Att. L. 14. Ep. 13., the greatest Trimmer known, And Quintus too, both trimm'd with horns, Declare, that till they lay alone, They envy'd those that lay on thorns. Unmarry'd, in a truckle bed, Lay me, says Quintus, with one blanket, In peace I will lay down my head, And every night say, G?d be thanked. The Trimmer, farther to secure him, Shall have his miss under the rose; Alas, what bliss can she procure him Half so good for him as repose! He can perform with moderation The highest pitch of high enjoyment; Just like a game of meditation. That's half a pleasure, half employment. So, notwithstanding this prevention, Be you assured, instead of rest, He's torturing his poor invention, And discomposing all his nest. All his affairs are gone astray, His lands engag'd, his forests groan, His credit taken wings, they say, And with his cash to Bath are flown. A new sport discovered by the gentlemen of that university. It is made up of a pleasant combination of horse races and cock-fights. As Cæsar said to a man that was haranguing him, “If you mean to sing, you are only declaiming; but if you intend to declaim, you are undoubtedly singing:” so you may say of this diversion, that if they call it Running, it is as like Fighting; but if they will have it to be Fighting, then it is more like Running.—The method is this: They run or fight a Whig or a Trimmer against a Cocobite or a Tory; or they make a subscription match, every subscriber producing his cock-horse, and this may be called a Sweep-stakes battle.His son is running him at Arthur's, His servants robbing him below; His wife and daughter catching Tartars, And both intriguing at Soho. But let us shift these scenes of vice, And leave the Trimmer to his fate; Lo, I will shew you Paradise, A Tory on his own estate. See those vast monuments of yew! Superb remains of Tory reigns! Wonders like those the Arabs view, Scow'ring Palmyra's sandy plains. Behind, down in that bottom look, Attended by tall pines in files, Close by the willow-wedded brook, See the old mansion, how it smiles! Enter the lofty hall, quite lin'd With helmets, halberts, pikes, and guns, Where James the First by chance once din'd, And left a brace of Latin puns. Open, ye everlasting doors! Yon folding doors at once disclose, Black oaken wainscot, black oak floors, And roofs with many an antique rose. See birds and beasts play round the pannels, Such as the Gothic chissel breeds, Those windows are the only annals Of all his great Forefather' deeds! Without pursuing mouldy pages, You've nothing farther to discuss, But to observe how many stages He has pass'd through to come to us: There you may see where he sets out Blazon'd by heraldry profound; And how, continuing his route, Here he is landed safe and sound. In the great dining-room, behold, Hanging distinguish'd from the rest, In gaudy frames of burnish'd gold, Three portraits fashionably drest. That in the middle, an old Beau The Old Pretender., Who seems to be worn out with sin; I know not; but, I think, I know Sir John, and Watkin Williams Wynne, Mark the old Butler on this head: His son, says he, with accent sad, Hangs above stairs by Miss's bed, A sweet young gentleman in plaid. Step to the buttery, there review His houshold troops, a faithful corps, In regimentals of true blue, Their heads with service silver'd o'er. Then to the kitchen we'll repair, But drink his health first in strong beer, Heavens, what an hospitable air! What a profusion of good chear! What looks of happiness and ease! What joy appears, when he seems gay! And yet, excepting casual fees, Long have they serv'd him without pay. All earthly blessings here abound, And multiply Jure divino, Just as in Paradise they're found, Without a sous of Ready Rino. In his meek spouse supremely happy, His heir the loveliest of swains, With punch detersive, and smooth nappy, He washes out his daughter's stains. Rachel, his wife, with savoury meat Regales her patriarchal Lord; Young Jacob, with unweary'd feet, Covers with game old Jacob's board. Here I could wander for a week, So much old Jacob I admire, Did not your frequent yawns bespeak Your inclination to retire. I shall add very little more, Just shew you how St. John enlarges, How, to inflame the Trimmer's score, He throws in two or three more charges. “You cry, we've all that man can crave, “No, you are wretched, weak, and poor, “As naked as a Negro Slave, “As much neglected as a Boor. “Whilst for wise Serpents you would pass, “'Tis by that wisdom you're undone; “Like blind Worms trod by Ox and Ass, “As they lie basking in the sun.” These words, or words to this effect, Are in my text, for 'tis no merit, Or rather 'tis a great defect, To stick to words and lose their spirit. And thus, beyond all contradiction, Your guilt is manifest and glaring; And, to my sorrow and affliction, Your trimming now is grown past bearing. Expect no favour, no remission, Hear me, ye Trimmers, great and small, By virtue of St. John's commission, I do condemn you one and all. Prepare yourselves for execution, When the evacuation's o'er, Like Jonas, take a resolution, Resolve to be spew'd out no more. MAKARONY FABLES; WITH THE NEW FABLE OF THE BEES. IN TWO CANTOS. ADDRESSED TO THE SOCIETY. BY COSMO, MYTHOGELASTICK, PROFESSOR, AND F.M.S. Beati non numerant horas, Ars longa vita brevis. Written in the year 1767. FABLE I. THE RESIGNATION The resignation of the Earl of Bute, in 1763.. A certain house swarmed with huge Rats, Traps, poison failed, baits they touched none; An able chief amongst the Cats Lord Bute. Picked them up slily one by one. All Libertines that stayed out late, All vagabonds, shared the same fate; This rous'd the Hanoverian breed The Whigs., It grew to be a serious case; If he was suffer'd to proceed, He would extinguish the whole race. A vote ensu'd, an order pass'd, A proclamation for a fast. Pursuant to their resolution, They watch'd and pray'd, entrench'd like moles, The Cat, by feline institution, Studied to draw them from their holes. He knew 'twas folly to pretend To act the patriot, or the friend. What people wish they soon believe, The Cat fell sick Lord Bute went to Harrowgate when he resigned., and took his bed; He formed his project to deceive, By lying down and seeming dead; He shut his eyes, his breath held in, Stretch'd out and streight, He lay in state, Just like a cat, worth nothing but his skin. He cannot long continue so, Says an old sage, stir not from hence; This dying comes too à propos, To be aught else than a pretence. The wiser sort maintain'd their ground; Grimalkin, baffled for this bout, Rose from the dead, and with a bound Rais'd the blockade, and let them out. Some younkers only, not worth keeping, That sally'd forth, paid for their peeping. Even thus, according to report, Edward's Grimalkin left his post; Or, in the language of the court, Thus Gaveston gave up the ghost. And though the subtile Gascoon lord Assur'd the barons he was dead; The barons would not take his word, Till they had taken off his head. The court declar'd him dead in law, And some weak folks bit at the show; But found that his contracted paw Retir'd to strike the surer blow.— Cats seldom die a natural death, As seldom favourites resign Naturally, without design, Till they resign their forfeit breath. FABLE II. The DOCTOR and STUDENT. A lobster, by a strange mistake, Scrap'd an acquaintance with a Snake; To learn his suppleness and arts, He boarded at the serpent's house; Lobsters have not the quickest parts, Arm'd cap-a-pee without much ????. The Doctor, not the least afraid, Although he knew, Lob was audacious; Long'd much to try what could be made Out of a head-piece so testaceous; All that a soldier can possess He oft repeated with a smile, With strength and courage, is address, In other words a little guile; As yet you are but raw, I see, Though far beyond your A B C; The best advice that I can give, A sentiment for Kings to drink; Let every one, not only live According to his rank, but think. You have a comprehensive mind, Lobsters ought not to think like oisters; They were not made to be confin'd, And spend their days like them in cloisters; To stand when they should stir and bustle, Gaping and studying like a muscle. Cadmus preferr'd, in all his lectures, Facts and experience to conjectures; Lobsters, by an instinctive force, Act selfishly, without design; Their feelings commonly are coarse, Their honour always superfine. Unfeeling, resolute, and cool, But tutor'd in the serpent lore, Lob grew, by taking pains at school, Ten times more selfish than before; Serpentine doubts and conscious fear Were hourly whispering in his ear, “That friend of yours so dark and sly, “Will sacrifice you in the end; “Bravely exert yourself and try “To be before-hand with your friend.” 'Twas what he often try'd, but found, Instead of gaining, he lost ground; Perhaps his brain was too much strain'd, Too weak to hold all it contain'd; So through some little crack or chink His plots were smelt, and soon detected; Like snuffers cramm'd, that, by their stink, Betray the snuffs they have collected. But time and fortitude at last Paid him for all his patience past; One day he enter'd without rapping, And caught the wary Cadmus napping: Lob scarce could credit what he saw, Finding him coil'd, and fast asleep, Fatigued with meditations deep, He choak'd his master with his claw.— Now ponder well, and be severe, Look sharp for some smart application; 'Twill fit both Commoner and Peer, If you have any provocation; Whether a Courtier, Statesman, or a Cit, Throughout you'll find some famous Biter bit. FABLE III. THE NIGHTINGALE. A nightingale, in her retreat, Exerted all her native powers; Compos'd and sung plaintively sweet, To charm the silent hours. A hungry Hawk in ambush lay, And seiz'd the hapless songster for his prey; The warbling Victim tried in vain To melt a cruel tyrant's heart; Proof against every moving strain, Of nature or of art. Charmer, said he, I wait too long, Hawks require food more solid than a song: Then with a villain's smile he struck The loveliest tenant of the wood; In her poor heart his beak he stuck, Rioting in her vital blood. Listen, ye fair ones, to my lay, Your ways with trembling caution mark! How many virgins fall a prey, To some base murderer in the dark. Your youth, your tears, your spotless fame, Add to the brutal fire fresh fuel; Deaf to compassion, dead to shame, Selfishness is always cruel. Ye candid souls, whose pulses beat With no distemper'd selfish heat, View here again a wretch oppress'd, And heaven and earth in vain implor'd; Robb'd of his property and rest, Devour'd by a rapacious Lord.— When Avarice and Power unblushing meet, Woe to the humble Neighbour of the Great. FABLE IV. THE BLACK BIRD The Rev. Mr. Sterne, author of Tristram Shandy, &amp;c. In concert with the curfew bell, An Owl was chaunting vespers in his cell; Upon the outside of the wall, A Black Bird, famous in that age, From a bow-window in the hall, Hung dangling in a wicker cage; Instead of psalmody and pray'rs, Like those good children of St. Francis; He seculariz'd all his airs, And took delight in wanton fancies. Whilst the bell toll'd, and the Owl chaunted, Every thing was calm and still; All nature seem'd wrapt and enchanted, Except the querulous, unthankful rill; Unaw'd by this imposing scene, Our Black Bird the enchantment broke; Flourish'd a sprightly air between, And whistled the Black Joke. This lively unexpected motion Set nature in a gayer light; Quite over-turn'd the Monks devotion, And scatter'd all the gloom of night. I have been taught in early youth, By an expert Metaphysician; That ridicule's the test of truth, And only match for superstition. Imposing rogues, with looks demure, At Rome keep all the world in awe; Wit is profane, learning impure, And reasoning against the law; Between two tapers and a book, Upon a dresser clean and neat, Behold a sacerdatol Cook, Cooking a dish of heavenly meat! How fine he curtsies! Make your bow, Thump your breast soundly, beat your poll; Lo! he has toss'd up a ragout, To fill the belly of your soul. Even here there are some holy men Would fain lead people by the nose; Did not a Black Bird now and then Benevolently interpose. My good Lord Bishop, Mr. Dean, You shall get nothing by your spite; Tristram shall whistle at your spleen, And put Hypocrisy to flight. FABLE V. POUR MOI MEME. Within a Joiner's shop upon a stool, With countenance serene and grave; A Cat examin'd every tool, As nicely as Rousseau's Elève. A File that understood its trade, Provok'd her Ladyship past bearing; Observing the great waste it made, By clipping artfully and paring. I'll serve you your own way, you knave, For that, says Puss, let me alone; I'll lick you with my tongue, you slave, Till I have lick'd you to the bone. She lick'd till her whole tongue was flead, And laugh'd to see the villain bleed; With blood he was all over red: Determining the File to kill, The Cat lick'd on, believing still It was the File, and not her tongue, that bled. My Gard'ner, my Coachman John, My Groom, my Butler, the whole Corps, Are objects to vent spleen upon, Whene'er the bileous pot boils o'er; But I'll grow better when I'm able, To fume and fret is not worth while. I am the Cat that bleeds in fable, My Family—th' unfeeling File. FABLE VI. THE TORTOISE. Creatures made chiefly for defence Are seldom overstock'd with sense. A Tortoise once, a military Beau, Hardy to give the beast his due, Walk'd to and fro' solemnly slow, Like Prussians at a review Completely arm'd from head to tail, Proof against either cut or stab; As full of blubber as a Whale, With brains no better than a Crab. Suppose ambition was inclin'd, To captivate his torpid mind, What could she do with such a mass? All that she could propose at most, Would be to lead him to some pass, And leave him standing like a post. But if conceit, instead of her, Should make a puncture in his breast; Conceit can make a Tortoise stir, And labour to outdo the best. And thus accordingly, one day, Busy and rolling in his way, Upon his axis like a Porpoise; I mean contemplating himself; Conceit came like a fairy elf, And took possession of my Tortoise. Under a rock the formal fop, With reconnoitring air and state, Observ'd an airy near the top, And saw an Eagle at the gate. Eagle, the Coxcomb cries, descend, I hate both grotto and alcove; Be it my glory to attend, And emulate the bird of Jove. I feel all feathery and light, Flush'd with warm vigour from fresh springs; Descend, and mount me out of sight, Consign me then to my own wings. The Eagle lighted on the plain, Arguments of all shapes he try'd; Not one would fit, 'twas all in vain, Some were too strait, and some too wide. Hard by, upon a thistly bed, An aged Ass repos'd, half dead; 'Tis nought but Hypocondriac pride, The fumes that laziness has bred; Before you try to fly, he cry'd, Hop over that old Ass's head. The fool, like all in that condition, Always flew out at opposition. Alas! what pains poor envy takes, The flimsy cap that she puts on Is too transparent, says the Don, To hide her execrable snakes; Stung to the soul with this reproach, The Eagle bade the sot approach; And, mounting him as high as he could soar, Now ply your wings, said he, 'tis time, Whether you nobly chuse to climb, To fall like light'ning, or to sweep the shore. He spoke, down dropp'd the Tortoise plum, With an explosion like a bomb; One crash confounding back and belly; His armour, once as hard as brass, Lay like a heap of broken glass, Lying upon a heap of jelly. Such I have met with in my walk, Tortoises of distinguish'd air, Creeping about to ask a talk, At Bloomsbury or Grosvenor square. They all are persons of great skill, They know what's fittest to be done; Landmen or Seamen, as they will, And Statesmen every mother's son; They can compose with their own hands All civil broils, all foreign jars; Not one of them but understands The disciplines of wars. Let but the Royal Eagle take him, Take any one, and mount him high; No arguments on earth can shake him; They all believe that they can fly. But, if he drops him, down he goes, And makes a pudding for the crows. FABLE VII. THE COOK Alludes to the supposed union between Lord Chatham and Lord Bute, in the autumn of 1763 and summer of 1766.. Æsop is always a new book, Æsop in a judicious hand; But 'tis in vain on it to look, Without the grace to understand. Pleasant his fables are indeed, Profound, ingenious, and sly; Fables that infancy may read, Maturity alone apply. A Cook was busy with his battery; Two sycophants, two knaves, I mean, Sat by, and play'd with red hot flattery, Against the battery Cuisine. Both engineers by profession, Their flattery was so well planted, They soon dismounted his discretion, Which was the only point they wanted; For having built a famous pie, Larded his fowls, barded his larks; As he had other fish to fry, He left the field to my two sparks; And, whilst he slash'd and carbonnaded, Stewed and hash'd, and gasconnaded, A Fish of a superb appearance Vanish'd from the kitchen table, Made a confusion worse than Babel; One of those fish, miscall'd by some, In which St. Peter us'd to deal; Stamp'd for himself, with his own thumb, The ancient Piscatory Seal. Therefore let Peter have the glory, Let us to him ascribe the Dorys; Call it not John but Peter Dory, Given Sub Sigillo Piscatoris. Advancing to the chopping block, Peace, cry'd the Cook, your clamours cease; Then with his cleaver gave a knock, And all the Kitchen was at peace. Says he, 'twas you, Sir, or your brother, No Cat comes here, I'll take my oath; Therefore it must be one or t'other; He quite forgot, it might be both. I have it not, the Thief reply'd, I stole it not, cried the Receiver; Both swore, protested, and deny'd, And so the Cook laid down his cleaver. The case seem'd so perplex'd and odd, And the Cook's thoughts were so divided; All three referr'd the case to God, And there it rests till he decide it.— Now from this Fable it appears, Or from this Fable I surmise; Some folks give credit to their ears, When they should scarce believe their eyes. This foolish Cook puts me in mind Of the most dupeable of nations; Busy and active; but resign'd To flattery on all occasions:— And so, because my moral's stale, I'll close my Fable with a Tale. A TALE. How many years it was ago, To ascertain I don't engage; Nor in what reign; I only know It happen'd in the Golden Age. Upon the record thus it stands:— Two worthy Ministers combin'd, To play into each other's hands, To cheat and puzzle all mankind. The silly people were cajol'd; And all their tricks went glibly down: At length one of them grew so bold, He laid his hands upon the crown; And, with more bravery than labour, Handed it to his crafty neighbour. When you say Crown, you often mean The owner, whether King or Queen; In such a case you may believe, The Priests would pray, the Laymen swear, A few would laugh, and some would grieve, And many want to hang this pair. I have him not, by Heaven! says John John earl of Bute.; I steal! cries Will William earl of Chatham., a likely thing! Stolen or stray'd, however gone, It was not I that stole your King. Thus us'd to puzzle and confound them, This nation's fury soon was past; The people left them as they found them, Forc'd to appeal to Heaven at last. Fortune was seldom known so cross; Few disappointments are completer: To lose their King was a great loss; Not to recover him a greater. FABLE VIII Alludes to the conference between the duke of Bedford, Mr. Grenville, and lord Bute, early in the year 1766, at lord Eglintoun's.. A Nonpareil, an Apple Tree The Duke of Bedford., A Commoner, haughty and proud Mr. Grenville., And a Pome-granate, a Grandee Lord Bute, One day disputed hard and loud: I am the Favourite of the nation, The Apple said, that's a plain case; I know your rank and occupation, And laugh'd in the Pomegranate's face; My merit's known to all mankind, I never courted your choice spirits; Your noble virtues are confin'd, Few people know your latent merits; Nor know your Virtues, like the Beaver's, Lie in your seminal Receivers. A Bramble Lord Eglintoun., sneaking like a rogue, Out of a hedge, and out of sight; Cry'd, Breeth'ren, with a Province brogue, Be Freends, and let us aw Unite. When the Great quarrel, the small Fry, Stir, and affect important vigour; Then Æsop says, the Ciphers try, But never can make any figure. THE NEW FABLE OF THE BEES: IN TWO CANTOS. HIS QUIDAM SIGNIS, ATQUE HÆC EXEMPLA SECUTI, ESSE APIBUS PARTEM DIVINÆ MENTIS, ET HAUSTUS ÆTHEREOS DIXERE: DEUM NAMQUE IRE PER OMNES TERRASQUE, TRACTUSQUE MARIS, CÆLUMQUE PROFUNDUM. Virg. Georg. L. IV. CANTO I. THE ARGUMENT. A preliminary discourse—The origin of police—The divine right of kings asserted upon new principles, more suitable to the goodness of God and good sense than the old principles that are taught at Oxford—The nature of courts—The court of Heaven—The court of requests—Angels—Ministers—The bee-piper—A speech—A prayer—A curse, in which all good people are desired to join—The conclusion. I never yet beheld that man, (With all the temper that you please) That started fair, and fairly ran Through the old fable of the bees: Because the verse the author chose, If verse, like ours, be verse indeed, Was made to introduce the prose, But never meant to take the lead; Whereas it should be the reverse, The prose should be the 'squire, or usher, To grace and wait upon the verse, Not a competitor or pusher. Verse ill-conducted or misplac'd, Meets with cold treatment and distaste; Much like a sermon, or discourse, With which you have been tir'd and vex'd; Neither begot in a right course Upon the body of a text, Made nor created, but proceeding, Incomprehensibly from reading. Through a variety of matter, And learned dirt, you splash and walk, Both for impertinence and chatter, Like his own lady's table-talk: But a good parson hates to poach; All his delight is in fair sporting, No harlot-text will he approach, But first to scripture goes a courting: A text by wooing he obtains, He takes her in a proper trim, And so begets with proper pains A sermon sound in wind and limb. It is a spurious production Begot in any other shape; Either the offspring of seduction, Or lawless issue of a rape. All kinds of governments that are, That of an emperor or king, Or of a queen like that of fairies, Nay, even down to my lord-mayor, Or, what's exactly the same thing, Down even to my lady mayoress. Accordingly the wits of Greece, And idle poets of all nations, Have studied bees for the police Of kingdoms, states, and corporations: That there are queens that rule the bees, Has been a point agreed long since: The learned say e'en lice and fleas Are govern'd by a sovereign prince; Through microscopes they plainly trace, In vermin that escape the sight, Monarchy and a royal race; Nature in Kings takes such delight; A fact that leads by steps direct, Farther, perhaps, than you suspect; That monarchs are of right divine Is evidently prov'd from hence; For Filmer's patriarchal line Proves nothing but his want of sense: This proves, to every apprehension, What none but wicked Whigs condemn, That monarchy is God's invention, Far too ingenious for them: But then 'twill follow full as plain, That, as they're kings by God appointed, All kings by the same patent reign; Sovereigns equally anointed; For the Creator of all creatures Is neither fond of shape nor size, Nor loves queen Bessy's eyes and features More than a Spider's face and eyes; Equally Source and God of all, All kings are equal in his sight, Whether the monarch's great or small, Whether a Brunswick or a mite. When treason spawns and traitors work, God will weigh both in equal scales, Whether a desperate Damien lurk Within a rotten cheese, or at Versailles. Kings, therefore, by God's charter reign, Monarchy seems to be a plan, Contriv'd to punish and restrain Licentious insects and vain man. Wherever there are kings and queens There must be plenty of intrigues; Variety of ways and means, Enmities, jealousies, and leagues; Both courts and Heaven, as David sings, In waiting, place their chief ambition, To see God's face, the queen's or king's, Both call the Beatific Vision: If heaven be a happier place, There are no sexes thereabout, No ministers but those of grace; For all the devils are turn'd out. Ladies, I own, one must be spiteful, Bad as a Turk, worse than a Jew, To think that Heaven could be delightful, If Heaven had no place for you: Heaven's harmony, as fools report, Would be quite drown'd in female noise: Heaven is not shut, like the Pope's court, To all but priests, eunuchs and boys. Yes, there are ladies in those bowers, Ladies that once were made like ours; But then they level all distinction, Before they enter into bliss; Each sex must suffer an extinction, They neither marry there nor p?ss. Our courts are the reverse of Heaven's, In everlasting change delighting; Always at sixes and at sevens, Intriguing, catterwauling, fighting: Here we abound in nought but sin, Here peace and rest were never known; Here all the devils are kept in, All that have any grace are flown. Within a hive a wand'ring drone, Of an uncommon size and mien, Stole by, unnotic'd, near the throne, And struck the fancy of the queen: When once a royal fancy's struck, The striker never leaves it short, Not only strikes, pushing his luck, But kicks the proudest of the court: 'Tis not a mighty pleasant thing, Nor much in favour of the many, Who, though allow'd to wear a sting, Are kick'd by creatures without any: Earl of Bute.He kick'd them up and down by dozens, But that which cut them to the quick, He sent for all his dirty cozens, And gave them liberty to kick. Gentle or simple 'twas the same, Once they began, all was fair game. A humble Bee The Earl of Chatham., once much in vogue, Who in an instant could inflame; Or, when enrag'd, the demagogue Could make an apiary tame: In an assembly held apart, Display'd the wonders of his art; First he deplor'd their present state, Then he amus'd them with a hum, Then he grew noisy and elate, And rais'd their spirits like a drum: Drummers and orators by noise, By drumming and by elocution, Often inspire both men and boys With eagerness and resolution. When their drum's brac'd, if they have skill, They move their audience as they will. Just so, by varying his notes, And adding action to the tone, He could have made them cut the throats Both of the courtiers and the drone. For Humble Bees to grandeur climb By oratory humbuzzonic, Like the great speakers of our time, By rhetoric stentorophonic; My dearest countrymen, said he, Far be it from me to despise A Drone for being not a Bee, I hate him for not being wise; When there's no wisdom in a guide, When once the guide loses his way, Whether we walk, or sail, or ride, 'Tis ten to one we go astray. Horrid and desperatious case, Big with terrificable woe, If any Bees within this place Are willingly Bee-wilder'd so, Such Bees I heartily renounce, However dignify'd and styled; Such Bees must be, I do pronounce, Bee-fooled, Bee-sotted, and Bee-guiled. What wickedness is left undone? What folly has not been committed? You are not only over-run, By stupid drones you are out-witted: Our colonies do they not bleed? Are not our brothers scorn'd and slighted, Except our brethren from the Tweed, With us mellifluously united? Is not the cause of this well known? You all of you know what I mean, You know the bagpipe of the drone Fascinates our gracious queen. What flesh alive can bear his scheamers, And their abominable schemes? Or, who can listen to his dreamers, And his interpreters of dreams? One of his Tools Mr. Grenville. try'd to be funny, Talk'd of his savings and his sparings, Attempted to seize all your honey, And make you live on apple-parings; A Drone (perdition catch his soul!) Full of pretensions and vain-glory; So very like a certain mole, I cannot help telling the story This story assumes to be a speech of Lord Chatham's.: “With intellects by nature muddy, A Mole Lord Bute. kept moiling under ground, Liv'd, like Duns Scotus, in his study, And got the name of the profound: At last by labouring and boring Amongst the blind and the Bee-nighted; And, by continually poring, He was accounted second-sighted: His mother, a discreet old dame, Knew well the genius of the youth; She was not such a dupe to Fame, To take all her reports for truth; She left her house, she came, in short, To judge herself of the report: Mother, said he, by all that's bright, I saw you tripping o'er the plain; What a fine thing is second-sight! 'Tis the perfection of the brain. I knew you, mother, well enough, I heard your step an hour ago, And smelt the fragrance of your ruff, As I was studying below. That you, says she, were always blind, Was not a point that wanted clearing, But now, alas, I also find, You've neither feeling, smell, nor hearing, Therefore, to keep your reputation, Lock yourself up, my learned son, Avoid all kind of conversation; If you converse, you are undone. Such is this Treasurer Mr. Grenville. of yours, Who should be sent, might I advise, To banishment, far from our flowers, And live on excrements with flies: There let him, without interruption, As a reward for his invention, Grow sleek and wanton with corruption; Let him enjoy a stinking pension.” Just gods! your kind assistance lend; Watch and protect the royal comb! Confound his instrument, and send The Piper Lord Bute. to his native home: Dismiss his mercenary Drones, Expose them to contempt and laughter, And finally break all their bones, If they attempt to enter after. Whilst he was speaking all was quiet, But perorating in that fashion, They rose up like a Polish Diet, And drew their sabres in a passion. Had he been there in that confusion, They were so heated with this actor, He had not 'scap'd for a contusion, Nor even for a simple fracture. CANTO II. THE ARGUMENT. The great Humming Bee delineated-A list of orators—An exceeding fine speech-Tories, why called-Conclusion-Moral. Their stings they brandish'd for a while, Till growing cooler by degrees, An Humble Bee Mr. E. Burke., with an arch smile, Answer'd the speech of Pericles Lord Chatham.; Pericles means, 'tis a Greek name, A Bee of an exalted fame. 'Twas not a common hackney tit, No, nor Bambalio Mr. Bamber Gascoigne. with his clangor, Nor Taratantara Right Hon. Charles Townshend., whose wit Is quite as harmless as his anger; Nor he General Conway. whose balmy words run off, No words run smoother or distincter, So oily, they would cure a cough, As soon as Hill's Balsamic Tincture; Nor the Bee-swain Mr. Grenville., a Bee as rare, All cloath'd in sattin and in silk, With speech and face both soft and fair, Like poultices of bread and milk; Nor Boreas Lord North., like a rumbling car, Nor Bumbo Alderman Beckford., who must ever speak ill, Whose eloquence resembles tar, Much more than honey or even treacle, Though he is sometimes called Molosses See Judas Johnson in the word Molosses, and his ingenious conjecture about Hugger-mugger., Which signifies the scum of sugar, So saith the druggerman Colossus Dr. Samuel Johnson., Who sold his master hugger-mugger; This Humble Bee, far from a ranter, Could not endure a noise and clatter, His fort was sly socratic banter, As to his name 'tis no great matter; Said he This speech assumes to be the speech of Mr. Burke; and it contains some features of a speech of that Gentleman's in the House of Commons, soon after the dismission of Lord Rockingham, and the appointment of Lord Chatham to the office of Privy Seal. The Reader will still observe, that Pericles is Lord Chatham, and the Bagpiper Lord Bute., the honourable Humble Is plac'd so high in our esteem, That if he chance to slip and tumble, I shall believe it is a dream. And yet I wish he would take the trouble, To shew his conduct in each point; Right when 'tis simple, better double, Most natural when out of joint. I do not mean, I am not so blind, So ignorant a ninny-hammer, That Pericles should be confin'd To rules of conduct or of grammar; I only wish that he would shew His right, by purchase or donation, To all the faith we can bestow, As well as all our admiration. 'Twould cut at once the Gordian knot, And reconcile each contradiction, Tergiversation be forgot, Duplicity and dereliction. In the mean time, on all occasions, Till he complies with these conditions, I must consider his orations Only as human compositions. Till he has clear'd this point before him, Though I admire I can't adore him. Why are the bagpipes such a sin? Or why in him alone a crime? Pericles try'd them out and in, But he could never play in time; And try'd, when it was all lost labour, To rival him with pipe and tabour: Nay, in the porches of her ear, Like Hamlet's uncle with a phial, When he could get the queen to hear, Pour'd the base notes of his bass-viol. He said, indeed, that all his playing Was meant to disenchant the queen The Poet does not here mean literally the Queen. In every hive of bees there is one large bee, called the Queen-bee. Under this character he includes the Court; or, more properly speaking, the Closet, and the secret influence that was asserted to prevail there.; But does he say what he is saying, Like people that say what they mean? So far from that, there's not a citling, That makes excursions in the summer; There's not a single shallow witling, That does not take him for a hummer: Therefore I earnestly beseech, In the behalf of this poor nation, That you will not regard his speech, More than his life and conversation. His arguments prove, more or less, However furbelow'd or dress'd; 'Tis not so much for our distress, As for himself, that he's distress'd. His arguments are truly curious, He hates him not for his ambition, Nor as a drone, but he is furious, Because he is the queen's musician: He hates his tunes, he hates his ways, And hates the pipe on which he plays: But if a bagpipe be essential To every drone both great and small, If Pericles be consequential, Then Pericles must hate them all. For 'tis recorded in old stories, How Drones By Drones here are meant the Country Gentlemen. But in other places (particularly in the last stanza, before the moral) the word signifies the Lords of the Bedchamber, and other sinecure placemen in the court and household, who are members or peers of parliament. and Tories got their name; Pipes were call'd Drones, and Pipers Tories, Now Drone and Tory mean the same. His compliment to Drones, I take it, Is not impenetrably deep, There are some Tory heads awake yet, That he would rather lull to sleep. To dream of honey, milk, and wine, For Tory dreams are always fine; As children in their nurses lap, Or rock'd in cradles sweetly lying, Are happier dreaming of their pap, Than when they're 'broad awake and crying. Now take your balance, and compare His speeches with his life and dealings, Or else you may, without such care, Take fine professions for fine feelings: In early youth he lost his place, He was a Trumpeter or Cornet Alludes to Sir Robert Walpole taking from Mr. Pitt his commission of Cornet of Horse., For spitting in the fav'rite's face, And calling him an ugly hornet. An old coquette amongst the wasps, Whilst Pericles was fresh and young, Whose sting and poison, like the asps, Lay chiefly in her head and tongue, Long after he was sent down stairs, Seduc'd him with her harlot airs; In the wasp cause he appeared hearty, Assum'd their language and their form, Vow'd to renounce the whole Bee-party, And take her majesty by storm: But when his passion was abated, He veer'd about without much pain; When love or avarice were sated, He turn'd a loyal Bee again: Ador'd the queen, humour'd the people In all their fancies and requests; Made the bells ring in every steeple, And drove their foes from all their nests. But ah! th' inconstancy of Bees! Roving and changing every hour! Wafted about by every breeze, Allur'd by every specious flower; For now, because the queen has pitch'd Upon the Piper to amuse her, Pericles swears she is bewitch'd When Mr. Pitt accepted the title of Earl of Chatham, his popularity suffered a temporary diminution., And sets his mob on to abuse her: This sure is jealousy and spleen, Not like true love and genuine duty; For if, like me, he lov'd the Queen, He could not injure such a beauty: Yet, to do justice to his merits, He always lov'd the Queen, I know; It is the fever on his spirits Makes him forget what subjects owe. As Pericles has shewn the way, Let me too introduce my tale This tale is an allegorical description of Lord Chatham's illness at Bath, in 1767; and of the changes in the ministry, and the coalition with the Bedford party, which took place early in the year following. The Wolf is Lord Shelburne; the Fox (or attorney) Lord Camden.; In a debate, before to-day, I have known a fable turn the scale. A Lion with a wand'ring gout, Upon his couch, or bed, lay roaring; The courtiers all stood round about, Every god and aid imploring. Excruciated like a martyr, The doctors brought a thousand slops; To pave the way for his departure, They pour'd them down the Lion's chops Of all the courtiers that attended, Waiting about him in a ring, The Wolf officiously pretended, To sympathize most with the King: Whilst we are all in such a fright, Sir, said the Wolf, it must appear, Neither convenient nor right, That your attorney is not here; My friend, the Fox, is much to blame, Now that your Majesty's so ill, To roam about killing your game, When you may want to make your will. At his return the Fox was told How handsomely his friend had serv'd him; His spite at me is very old, Says master Fox, I have observ'd him; Only because I go a fowling, Am rich, and entertain my friends, Whilst he, for very hunger howling, Is fit to eat his fingers ends. Volpone, that instant ran to court, Salutes the Wolf quite frank and hearty, The Monarch cried, had you good sport? Sir Reynard, who was of your party? Your Majesty, says the attorney, Is misinform'd about my journey; That I was hunting, is most true, Making the strictest perquisitions Of the most eminent physicians About a remedy for you. When your gout's fix'd or quite remov'd, Then, Sir, my care and pious zeal, For you, and for the common-weal, Will be acknowledg'd and approv'd. In the mean time, I must proceed To tell my sov'reign of his cure; His royal heart, I know, will bleed; I feel myself, what he'll endure: A Wolf must presently be got, In such a case it is no sin, Flay him alive, and piping hot Wrap the King up in the Wolf's skin. Thus Sir, if you will be directed, Your pains will quickly be abated, The morbid matter be ejected, And health and vigour re-instated. The Lion rising from his bed, Proceeding without any heat With one stroke only on the head, Laid the Wolf breathless at his feet; For simple vanity indited, If the Mole's exile was decreed Alludes to the proscription of Lord Bute in 1763., I think the Wolf, that's so sharp-sighted, Was with the greatest justice flay'd Lord Shelburne was removed at the instigation of the Duke of Grafton, who had been appointed minister by Lord Chatham., For to vain-glory and weak pride, He added perfidy beside. If any here was flay'd alive, Drawn in by any tempting snare, To make the Queen alert and thrive, 'Twas not the Drone's plot you may swear. But to conclude, let me advise Pericles to withdraw his motion, He must at last open his eyes, 'Tis so undutiful a notion; Therefore, I hope, that he will use His Sovereign better for the future; And that you'll vote the Queen shall chuse Whatever instrument may suit her. As she loves bagpipes out of measure, As Pericles is her aversion, Indulge her royal health and pleasure, It is an innocent diversion: Let her old piper play his lilts, Let him go on in his vocation; Suffer not Pericles on stilts To take away her consolation. They all concurred, as you will guess, And, as you must have pre-conceiv'd, Drew up, and went with an address, And were most graciously receiv'd. The whole was nothing but collusion; But what makes me, and should make you sick; Pericles, chief of the confusion, Was made the chief of the Queen's musick; And thus these two renown'd debators, Amus'd the people with sham matches; And, like two honest gladiators Alludes to the supposed coalition between Lord Bute and Lord Chatham, in 1767., They made the fools pay for their scratches. The Piper Lord Bute. pipes, the Drones continue, The Buzzers The People. only gape and gaze, Pericles, with a grand retinue, Is humming somewhere about Hayes. MORAL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II IMITATIONS OF HORACE'S ODES. BOOK III. ODE III. TO JOHN WILKES, ESQ. The man religious to his word, And a firm Christian, firm as you, Whose principles are like his sword, True to dame Honour, whilst she's true; Like you, may laugh at tyrant peers; Nor can the base apostate's vote, Nor ruin, thundering in his ears, Cram Tory nonsense down his throat. Hambden and Pym by arts like these To glorious patriots once gave law, And now give nectar on their knees, To both the Georges and Nassau. Nor with less art fanatic Vane Rul'd the wild Whigs by frantic pray'r, Like tigers patient of the rein, When Bacchus steps into the chair. Cromwell, Bellona's charioteer, Ascending to the realms of day, With fiends and furies in his rear, Through storms and thunder forc'd his way. Thus to her Sydney Freedom spoke— “Trust thee I will, tho' oft betray'd; “Tho' Wentworth Lord Rockingham, who accepted the Treasury in 1765., for lewd folly's yoke, “Left me and the Athenian maid. “Remove yon foreign dame with speed, “That wicked judge, those courtiers vile, “Men that can neither write nor read, “And give me back my ravish'd isle. “'Tis well—I see the miscreants fly: “No Fav'rite now, with haughty mien, “Shall dare to rival kings, and try, “Like Villiers, to seduce a queen. “And with prophetic eyes I view “A monk, the last of Stuart's race, “In exile, and his slavish crew “Of perjur'd Tories in disgrace “Treason and he to Rome are fled Lord Bute went to Rome in 1768.; “There let him reign without restraint; “And, when the spurious monarch's dead, “Let him be made a Roman saint. “Whilst seas divide us, let them shine, “Let saints and martyrs for them battle; “Whilst Stuart's tomb, like Becket's shrine, “Is only trod by Romish cattle. “On Magna Charta's solid base “Britannia's Majesty shall stand; “Confin'd alone by boundless space, “Her sons shall conquer sea and land. “Nor showers of lead nor pointed steel “Their native ardour shall withhold: “Thrice happy, could they always feel “The same innate contempt for gold. “O Britons! whilst your banners wave “In every clime, on every shore, “Deep as the center make a grave, “And bury that pernicious ore; “Lest Tyranny again should rise, “Enrich'd and strengthen'd by your gains, “Dazzle your delegates weak eyes, “And bind them fast in golden chains: “Chains which, however, soon or late, “I'll break, as I have done before; “Your chains are not like those of fate, “That tie the Frenchman to his oar. “For, should the Goths again prevail, “Should impious men again bear sway, “Their blaze shall, like a comet's tail, “Awe none but fools, and pass away. “Ev'n if rebellion, a third time, “Shall rise again and leave her bed, “Freedom again shall load and prime, “And the Third Brunswick shoot her dead.” But hold—this is too high a flight; I fear we both shall come to shame: Return, my Muse, whilst we have light, I am half blind, and you are lame. BOOK IV. ODE IX. To LOLLIUS. Though born in an ungenial clime, Where T. with brawls his tribute pays, 'Tis possible, my lord, for Time To fancy these uncommon lays. If Shakspeare every Muse inspire, Sole sovereign of the tuneful throng, Praise still is due to Cowley's lyre, And Gray's sweet melancholy song. Prior shall live with laughing eye Amongst the vivid sons of fame; Maids ever weep, and widows sigh, And burn with Eloisa's flame. Not Sparta's queen alone has tripp'd, Charm'd with fine breeding and fine clothes; Other fair princesses have slipp'd Brantome furnishes us with many examples of royal frailty., And troubled the whole world's repose. Teucer is not the only prince Famous for shooting the long bow Cydonio arcu—the Cretan or long bow. See St. Paul's Epistle to Titus, chap. i. ver. 12: ?????? ??? ???????. The Stuart race of princes were as famous as Teucer for the Cretan bow.. Troy has been lost before, and since, By cunning, with a patriot shew. Heroes have bled as well as Hector, Both for their minions and chaste wives; Else how had Cromwell been protector, Or Charles and Edward lost their lives? Pitts with the same aspiring mind In dark oblivion are gone down; But they have not the luck to find Churchills Charles Churchill the poet, who celebrates Lord Chatham in his works. to hand them to renown. Worth, undistinguish'd by applause, But equals sloth; nor shall the chief In livid silence guard our laws, Forgotten like a mouldy brief. Supremely wise when wisdom's wanted, Prudent where caution is a merit, Upright, inflexible, undaunted, Pure and enlighten'd like a spirit. Sworn enemy to falsehood base, Against corruption firm and steady, Not for one single heat or race, But always booted, always ready. You rose at Freedom's sacred call, Snatch'd her from th' invading great, Added new trophies to her hall, And fix'd the goddess in her seat. 'Tis the wise use, not the possessing, The smiles of fortune or of kings, That can make wealth a real blessing, Or take from poverty her stings. That dignifies the virtuous man, Scorning, though poor, to flinch or faulter, Who for his prince or his dear clan Despises the impending halter. BOOK III. ODE XXIX. To MÆCENAS. Offspring of British kings of yore, To put your spirits in fine tune, I have some Burgundy in store, With roses for the tenth of June The Pretender's birth day, when the Jacobites used to put white roses in their bosoms and hats.. Quit those damp glades, nor musing mope, Enchanted with your arms across, Fix'd like a statue on a slope, Or the pagoda like a Joss. Let not the noise of yon black city One moment discompose your peace; Look down on pomp awhile with pity, And let fastidious plenty cease. A grateful change to homely fare, A cot, a barn-door fowl, and mutton, Oft smooth the anxious face of care, And squeamishness herself turns glutton. Now Phœbus rages, now the swain With languor drives his fainting sheep From the parch'd meads and sultry plain, To silver streams and thickets deep. Upon the Thames there's not a breeze, No zephyr with expiring breath, To animate those horrid trees, Silent and motionless as death. There you form all your decent plans, To righteousness give a new birth; And with your Tories and your clans Govern the princes of the earth. Heaven kindly keeps us in the dark, And, spite of all our fine-spun schemes, Laughs when we overshoot the mark, Both at our fears and sanguine dreams. The present's all we have to heed; Futurity is like a current; Now smooth and pleasant as the Tweed, Now dreadful like a highland torrent. Tumbling with fury down the vale, The rocks resound the mountains rattle; Pines float along with groves of cale, Huts, plaids, blue bonnets, and black cattle. Happy is he who lives to-day, Lives for himself, 'tis so much gain, Whether the next be sad or gay, Or the sun never rise again. 'Tis done—nor can the power of fate Cancel and set the deed aside, Nor Fortune's insolence and hate That loves to mortify our pride. Let her pursue her cruel sport, Past pleasures cannot be destroy'd; She cannot, as she does at court, Vacate what we have once enjoy'd. Faithful whilst she continues mine; But, if she violates my bed, The painted harlot I resign, And Virtue, though unportion'd, wed. When the storm beats, and seas run high, I shall not importune with prayers, The angry princes of the sky To spare my curious Cyprean wares. Nor duped by hope, like many a one, Stay blubbering beneath the deck, But, when both mast and rudder's gone, Take to my boat and leave the wreck. BOOK IV. ODE XVth. A TORY ODE Alludes to the Accession of the Tories to power and places, soon after the Accession of George the Third.. I tried to sing, and touch'd my strings, Of cities storm'd and conquer'd kings; But Phœbus cried, What notes are these? Forbear; nor let thy flimsey sail, Swell'd by a light delusive gale, Expose thee to the classic seas. This age has brought us golden days, Our guardian saint is cloy'd with praise, With trophies and triumphant banners; He lets St. Andrew clear the coast, And drive the Whigs from every post, To sweeten and correct their manners. Cæsar has shut the gates of Janus The peace made by the King, in 1763., And our Mæcenas Lord Bute.to contain us, Apt to be mutinous and idle, Vamps the old arts, and makes them fit, And changes Pelham's foolish bit For Mansfield's scientific bridle. By these old arts, Britannia's fame, Diffusive as the Roman name, In every clime has fix'd her standard, As far as from the farthest West To where the Phœnix builds her nest, As far as ever Scotchman wander'd. Whilst Tories rule, no civil fury, No persecuting judge nor jury, Shall interrupt our sweet repose; No angry parties draw their swords, No leaders with big looks and words, Shall lead their princes by the nose. Our laws like thunderbolts are hurl'd, And echo'd round the conquer'd world, Their voice the stoutest heart appals, Sachems in awful horror bound, Hear not with wonder more profound Niagara's tremendous falls. Whilst we, our wives and children, all Assembled in the good old hall, And every neighbour young and old, With Christmas merriment and cheer, Plenty of cider, punch, and beer, Fiddles and pipes like barons bold, Shall toast with bumpers and huzzas The chiefs that fell in the old cause, And celebrate the heavenly breed, Sprung from a Latian swain's embrace The Anchises of the Tories was an Italian fidler., When Venus took the form and face Of the fair daughter of the Tweed. BOOK XXIV. ODE VIII. The ingenious author of the admired treatises on Painting, Poetry, Music, &amp;c. &amp;c. TO DANIEL WEBB, ESQ. I would, with all my heart and soul, Send every friend a golden bowl, And with each bowl a purse of gold, To fill the bowl and make it smile, And to secure the bowl awhile, From being either pawn'd or sold. To every military friend, Heroick tripods I would send, Tripods fit only for brave fellows That is to say, crutches a pair, And one stout leg of the same ware, Made like the nossel of a bellows. Pictures I'd send of every school, I am so generous a fool, With statues too and busts for niches, These I would send to none but you, The prince and mirror of virtù, If I was master of such riches. As to virtù, that point's decided, You are sufficiently provided; All that you want of me is metre, You may have plenty at my forge, I need not steal, like thrifty George George Grenville., From Paul, in order to pay Peter. I know the price of lyrick song Easy, yet elegantly strong, And know that Beckford's head of marble, I mean that head the sculptor made, That marble head will sooner fade, Than any songs the Muses warble. Your fame must fly with wings of paper, Be you a Wolfe, a Howe, a Draper, Victor at Minden or at Canna, Or legislator great as he, That led the Jews through the Red Sea, And pamper'd them with quails and manna. Great bards great favours can bestow, In heaven above or hell below, They can convey you with a nod, From Styx, whenever they think fit, And call you up to heaven by writ, And make you an immortal god. Lollius Lord Mansfield. with Æacus may dwell; Minos and he may judge in hell, When future poets sing his worth, Bute may, like Enoch, be translated, Then made a star, and made related To slow Bootes of the North I know there is classical authority for this epithet, Sive est arctophylax sive est piger ille Bootes. Yet I cannot help fancying the author wrote Sly, instead of Slow Bootes; he is represented in his northern situation watching his charge with unremitting vigilance; and I am apt to believe that our Sly Boots is a contraction of Bootes. I have seen the same thought in a manuscript collection of verses composed by the professors of a famous university upon the Revolution in 1760. It was beautifully pursued in the verses of the astronomy professor, which struck me so that I still retain them, Attendant upon Charles's wane, Bootes, commonly called Bute, The brightest star in all his train, Without all manner of dispute: May thou forever fixt remain, Cunning and watchful as the dragon: Let Ursa Minor break his chain, And overturn the northern waggon. Ov. Fast. iii. 405..

Grandson of Atlas, the most chaste Whoever heard besides this author, that Atlas the father of Maia was remarkable for chastity? Critical Review. Reformer of the lewd and wicked, Moulding green senators like paste, By catches and decorous cricket. Thee messenger of Jove I'll sing, Professor of the crooked lyre, Jocosely stealing to the spring, Through every crooked dark desire. Robb'd and betray'd, ungodly John John Wilkes., Threatning to shoot thee through the liver, Laugh'd when he found his arrows gone, And saw thee sporting with his quiver. Leaving the Whigs at thy persuasion, Whilst Pelham's beacons blaz'd in vain, Dives forgot his flaggellation Alluding to a transaction of great notoriety, which happened to the Duke of Bedford at Litchfield., And turn'd a Cocobite again. To pious souls, delightful benches, Blest Lord! thy golden rod assigns, And works great marvels on light wenches, Grateful to princes and divines Superis deorum gratus et imis Grateful to princes and divines. As the author has not sufficiently declared which of these personages are the superi deorum, we presume, that he leaves them at liberty to toss up for it. Monthly Review. BOOK II. ODE VIII. To NELLY OBRIEN. I would believe you once again, Were you a tooth or nail the worse For every oath you take in vain, And every violated curse: Though you bid Jasus fire your bones, Confound yourself and all your kin; Blast those bright eyes like precious stones; Damn Helen's limbs and Leda's skin, False and forsworn a thousand times, Obrien's still the public toast, Still grows more lovely from her crimes, Godby's intrigue and Welche's boast. Thy perjury and subtle arts, Venus and Cupid smiling view; Fell love that whets with blood his darts, On whetstone of infernal blue Lapis infernalis, or the blue stone.. For thee our youth shoot up and grow; Each day adds captives to thy store; Nor can the old exhausted beau Forbear to hanker at thy door. Mothers and misers fear thee still; Young beauteous brides are in alarms, Lest thy maturer charms and skill Should draw their husbands to thy arms. The APOTHEOSIS or the INSTELLATION. BOOK III. ODE XXV. To BACCHUS. Whither, O Bacchus, am I hurry'd, O'er mountains high, thro' woods and valleys; How are my spirits toss'd and flurry'd, With sudden and unwonted sallies! Where can I find a cave to muse Upon his lordship's envied glory; Which of the Nine dare to refuse To tell the strange and recent story? Mounting I saw the egregious lord Lord Bute, made Knight of the Garter., O'er all impediments and bars; I saw him at Jove's council-board, And saw him stuck amongst the stars. Not more amaz'd, with ivy crown'd, Thy priestess, having booz'd all night, In chains of ice sees Hebrus bound, And all the Thracian mountains white. I saw him top the Pyrenees, And lost him in the blaze of day; At night I spy'd him at his ease, With Anser in the milky way. Thou, to whom Naiads bend their knees, That nightly sport in Charlotte's Charlotte Hayes. bowers, Whose hands can pluck up forest trees, As easily as gather flowers; Deign to inspire my feeble song; Deign to accompany my flight; Inform me, Bacchus, when I'm wrong, Invigorate me when I'm right. I hate tame themes, abhor tame measure, And scorn the vulgar's tasteless praises: 'Tis hazardous; but O what pleasure To reel with thee through pathless mazes! BOOK III. ODE XXVI. To VENUS. Once, though not lately, I confess, I lov'd, and lov'd with some success; But now, ay now, 'tis quite provoking, Now I will hang up my fine cloaths, Hang up my harp and take to prose, And try to turn my pipe to smoaking. Samples of hair, in fine condition, Surrender'd by fair composition, Taken by storm, or won by guile; Writings, for writing sake, not reading, Assignments, grants, and special pleading, Shall blaze in one funereal pile. Mountains are hoary oft with snow, When all the vales are green below, Still, Venus, let me cleave to thee; Let Chloe but a while be kind, Then, if my Chloe change her mind, Chloe will only copy me. BOOK III. ODE III. To THOMAS SCROOPE, Esq. Remember, friend, to shun excess, Ill suited to a life so frail and short; Let no perplexing care oppress, No giddy joy to insolence transport. Whether, to gloomy thoughts resign'd, By drops, like sullen thaws, hours melt away, Or the gay sun-shine of the mind Fills all the soul with intellectual day. Whether, in social bowers, you ply The festive bowl, or, by some dimpling stream, Indulge the sentimental sigh, At life's absurd, inexplicable dream: Let wine and elegance unite, Their choicest blessings largely to dispense; Quicken desire, improve delight, And give the sweetest feelings to the sense. Whilst fate the present bliss bestows, Catch the important moment, ere 'tis pass'd, Fleeting and pleasant as the short-liv'd rose, Exhaling fragrance to the last. Those groves you view with looks so tender, Those flow'ring shrubs, rear'd with a parent's care, You must relinquish and surrender To the capricious fancy of your heir. Nor boots it, whether poor or rich, Whether you are nobly born or meanly bred; Whether you drop your being in a ditch, Or leave it lingering in a bed. For, soon or late, the fatal urn Shall issue forth our last relentless doom; To exile sent, without return, To endless rest, and an eternal tomb. To Miss ? Grazie a gl'inganni tuoi, Alfin respiro, O Nice; Alfin d'uno infedele Ebber gli dei pietà. Metastasio Thanks to your wiles, deceitful fair, The gods, so long in vain implor'd, At last have heard a wretch's prayer; At last I find myself restor'd. From thy bewitching snares and thee: I feel for once this is no dream; I feel my captive soul is free; And I am truly what I seem. I cannot now, as heretofore, Put on indifference or disdain, To smother flames, that burn no more, To hide a passion void of pain. Without a blush, your name I hear, No transient glow my bosom heats; And, when I meet your eye, my dear, My fluttering heart no longer beats. I dream, but I no longer find Your form still present to my view; I wake, but now my vacant mind No longer waking dreams of you: Absent for you, no more I pine, But wander careless day or night; Present, no word, no look, no sign, Argues disturbance or delight, I hear your praise, no tender flame Now thrills responsive through my veins; No indignation, only shame, For all my former wrongs remains. I meet you now without alarms, Nor longer fearful to displease; I talk with ease about your charms, E'en with my rival talk with ease. Whether in angry mood you rise, Or sweetly sit with placid guile, Vain is the lightning of your eyes, And vainer still your gilded smile. Loves, in your smiles, no longer play; Your lips, your tongue, have lost their art; Those eyes have now forgot the way That led directly to my heart. Whether with grief the mind's diseased, Or the unburthen'd spirits, glad; No thanks to you, when I am pleased, You have no blame, when I am sad Hills, woods, and lawns, and bleating flocks, Without you, captivate me still, But dreary moors and naked rocks, Tho' with you, make my blood run chill. Hear me; and judge if I'm sincere; That you are beauteous still I swear; But Oh! no longer you appear The fairest, and the only fair. Hear me; but let not truth offend, In that fine form, in many places, I now spy faults, my lovely friend, Which I mistook before for graces. And yet, though free, I thought at first, With shame my weakness I confess, My agonizing heart would burst, The agonies of death are less. Who would not, when his soul's oppress'd, Gladly possess himself again? To pluck a serpent from his breast, Who would not bear the sharpest pain? The little songster thus you see Caught in the cruel school-boy's toils, Struggling for life, at last, like me, Escapes, and leaves his feather'd spoils. His plumage soon resumes its gloss, His little heart soon waxes gay; Nor falls, grown cautious from his loss, To artifice again a prey. Perhaps you think I only feign, I do but strive against the stream, Else why for ever in this strain, Why talk upon no other theme? It is not love, it is not pique, That gives my whole discourse this cast; 'Tis nature that delights to speak Eternally of dangers past. Carousing o'er the midnight bowl The soldier never ceasing prates, Shews every scar to every soul, And every hair-breadth 'scape relates. Thus the poor galley slave, released From pains as great and bonds as strong. On his past sufferings seems to feast, And hug the chain he dragg'd so long. To talk is all that I desire; When once I let my larum go, I never stop, nor once enquire, Whether you're entertain'd or no. Which of us has most cause to grieve? Which situation would you choose? I, a capricious tyrant leave, And you, a faithful lover lose. I can find maids in every rout, With smiles as false, and forms as fine; But you must search the world throughout, To find a heart as true as mine. ODE. Full long to laughter-loving fancy wed, A foe to nought but treachery and art, Though mirthful folly ever claim'd my head, My friends and country always had my heart. Erato, void of true celestial fire, For thee, weak maid, my feelings are too strong: Clio, for once, will animate my lyre, And let my country have one virtuous song. Whilst wretched Albion for ages mourns Her conquering sons like laurel'd victims slain; O could I write, upon their sacred urns, A verse as lasting as Britannia's pain! Blush, blush, to read how injur'd Braddock General Braddock, killed in America, in 1755. fought; Braddock in whom were ever found ally'd, The soldier's ardour with the chieftain's thought, The stoic's fortitude, without his pride. Unmindful of the hero's dying prayer, Heaven struck a dreadful and avenging blow; A blow that wrung from England in despair, Those bitter tears that flow'd for Wolfe General Wolfe, slain at Quebec. and Howe Lord Howe, killed before Ticonderoga, July, 1758.. Congenial spirits, each a self-form'd chief, Each great as any chief in ancient lore, Born to extend her glory and her grief, Beyond what Britain ever knew before. Valiant in arms, courteous and gay in peace, See Williams Sir William Peer Williams, killed at Bellisle, in the year 1761. See an epitaph on him in Gray's Works. snatch'd to an untimely tomb! With every art and elegance of Græce, And all the energy of patriot Rome. And Armytage Sir John Armytage, member of parliament for York, killed at St. Cas, in September, 1758, a young gentleman of large fortune and great expectation., alas! in blooming youth, Left undistinguish'd in a hostile grave, Whom neither plighted love, nor candid truth, Nor spirited integrity could save. Lo! tow'ring Downe Lord Viscount Downe of the kingdom of Ireland. He died Dec. 26, 1760, of the wounds he received at Campen, in Germany. He was one of the knights of the shire for the county of York, lieutenant colonel of the 25th regiment of foot, and colonel of the southern battalion of the Yorkshire West Riding militia., impatient of repose, Borne on immortal Fame's impetuous wing, Falls in the midst of Britain's fiercest foes, And blasts the wreath design'd him by his king. Learn, Britons, from your king, on worth to smile, Or heaven may still have greater ills in store: Brunswick's fair race may cease to bless your isle, And liberty forsake her native shore. FABLES FOR GROWN GENTLEMEN: FOR THE YEAR 1770. PART II FABLE I. TO MY LORD ? With parts, tho' little worse for wearing, That scarce would pay for the repairing, A man past forty-five, Furnish'd with indolence and pride, A huge tremendous spouse beside, To save his soul alive, Was sitting yawning by the sea, Twirling his snuff-box just like me. Vanquish'd almost by strenuous sloth, He set himself a task at length, A task above his worship's strength, Above the strength of both. “To sit with an attentive eye “To mark and take a strict account, “And know exactly the amount “Of all the waves as they pass'd by.” So putting on, to suit the case, A calculating placid face, He kept his reck'ning and discretion, Till, by miscounting grown confus'd, And consequently disamus'd, He broke the series of progression; Which, overflowing, fill'd him quite Up to the throat with spleen and spite. During this vap'rish fit of grief, A Fox stepp'd up (my Lord, 'tis true, It was your genius, though not you), A Fox stepp'd up to his relief. Begin again, said he, and mind; Why will you poison your enjoyment? Are there not waves enow behind, Enow for your whole life's employment? Of all those millions that were lent, Myriads of millions must have bounds, Of all those millions you have spent, I speak of moments, not of pounds, Keep no account, nor heed the sum, Time past is An Exchequer term, the charge is answered by a cipher. nitchil, my good friend, Remember only how you spend The present and the time to come. FABLE II. TO A GREAT LAWYER. Pray tell me, Sir, in what respect, What harm, says Pert, in a pert gown, Do you imagine or expect From us, the servants of the Crown. Why none at all, if you were wise; And there, perhaps, the danger lies. But let me tell you, said Sir John, (It was a roguish Whig that spoke) How Æsop once was set upon, And how he flung them with a joke. A set of jolly tars one day, Of Athens the supporters, Joking with Æsop in their way, Just like a set of drunken porters; Come on, cries one, my cunning man, Unload that pack Upon your back, Give us a Fable spick and span. Then claps him on the back, and hollows; On which, out came the tale that follows: Nature had suffer'd a contusion, Old Ocean from his seat had wander'd, When Jove, to clear up the confusion And bring things to their proper standard, Cried out, Drink, Earth, with all thy might, Three drunken bouts will set all right. She drank such draughts for the first time, The mountains, soaking like a toast, Uncover'd to the roots almost, Appear'd with heaps of mud and slime. The second bout, the trees appear'd; The third, the valleys were quite clear'd: Had she continu'd in that cue, It would have been the worse for you, For by and by She must have drunk the ocean dry; And, if she had, my witty men, What would you sailors have done then? Now, Sir, by way of application, Pray look at our low situation, Surrounded by a sea of law, In imitation of our betters, We try to keep this sea in awe, Like Xerxes and the Dutch, with fetters; That is, with many a bank and fence, Labour and infinite expence, We keep in pretty decent bounds Prerogative, or royal pride, That overflow our neighbours' grounds, And spread destruction far and wide. Suppose, from any cause you please, You, who are trusted with the keys, Who ought to watch against abuses, Should think it neither harm nor sin, To open all your gates and sluices, And let the foaming waters in. In such a case, to say no more, Reck'ning all those that must be drown'd, And some perhaps that may be found Knock'd on the head ashore, Tell me, ye men of subtile brain, How many Lawyers will remain? FABLE III. A wolf pursu'd a Kid one day, Left by a shepherd through mistake, That, like a truant at a wake, Loiter'd behind to sport and play. So well Sir Lupus play'd his part There was no chance in any shape For her escape, Unless she could escape by art. As he press'd hard upon her rear, The cunning jade, Like a distress'd and injur'd maid, Turn'd round, and dropp'd a tear. Dread Sir, she cried, I see my ate, Suspend your hunger and your hate, Oh! let me hear that voice so sweet, Charm me once more before my death, Your humble maid shall at your feet, With joy, resign her breath. The Wolf set up a hideous howl; The moment he began to sing, He made the woods and valleys ring, And frighten'd every beast and fowl. He scarce had rung a dozen peals, When, following as they were bid, A hundred dogs were at his heels, Which put the Wolf to flight, and sav'd the Kid. Thus hunted Liberty besought A respite for a certain season, Begging, before he cut her throat, To hear her learned Butcher reason. The Butcher made so great a din, His eloquence brought down the rabble; Glad to escape with a whole skin, Freedom left him and them to squabble. Bad tenets openly maintain'd Are not so bad as good ones feign'd; Filmer, so far from doing harm, Serv'd, like the Wolf, to give th' alarm. FABLE IV. Thoughtfully walking in his park, His Grace, with eyes fix'd on the ground, Beheld an object of small mark, Made like a furz-ball, dark and round; And, like one trod upon, it broke, Gave a loud crack, and sent forth smoke. His Grace's diamond buckles sullied, He kick'd the ball with great disdain, As if disdaining to be bullied; The ball look'd twice as big again. Again he kick'd, kick after kick, Then took a stone, then tried a stick; The ball went on at such a pace, It was grown bigger than his Grace. Zounds! said the Duke, what have we here? What means this foolish apparition? Minerva whisper'd in his ear, My Lord, it means the opposition. FABLE V. An Ass was limping in great pain: A nail, or else a pointed stick, Had pierc'd his foot into the quick; And all attempts to get it out were vain. With melancholy face, Quite in despair, he turn'd his back Upon both Regular and Quack, And told a Wolf his case; With you, said he, my sufferings end, Into your paws my life I put: Eat me; but first, Sir, condescend To draw the nail out of my foot; Let me enjoy one moment's ease, Devour me after when you please. With teeth as hard as brass, The Wolf drew out the nail; On which his patient, John the Ass, Whisking about his Ass's tail, Full at the Wolf let fly a stroke, That broke his jaws, and would have broke A helmet, or a coat of mail, That spoil'd his instruments for drawing, And stripp'd him of his tools for chawing. Friend, said the Ass, you are right serv'd; Why would you alter your condition? 'Tis fit a butcher should be starv'd When he sets up for a physician. A thousand times it has been told, 'Tis true; But, if the Fable's trite and old, You'll own the application's new. A man of wealth, therefore of weight, A most notorious malefactor, Approach'd a minister of state, With loaded hands, though no contractor; Five thousand Hoares, five thousand banks, A ring and twenty thousand thanks; Take but this thorn out of my side, Prevent my fall; My boroughs, ever bound and tied, Shall wait your lordship's call. My Lord, said he, naught can defeat us, If you will grant me my quietus. 'Twas done; and bravely done, no doubt, For now he join'd his powers and strength, And had the happiness at length To help to kick his Lordship out. FABLE VI. Crossing a river swift and wide, A Horse, with an indignant eye, Beheld a foolish piece of pride, A piece of dung come prancing by. Behold, said he, that compost vile, The filthy stuff, That was behind me half a mile, Is now before me far enough. But why should this make a Horse sick? This is not any new vagary, Fortune plays many a worse trick, Quoties voluit jocari. For the sake of the Ladies the Author altered it.But why should this make a Horse sick? Delighted with malicious jokes, Fortune plays many a worse trick, When she plays some of her fine strokes. Did not she, fearless of reproach, Bestow on him that rubb'd my heels, My master's widow and his coach, And kitchen-stuff, to grease the wheels? The lucky dog, said he, and smil'd, Has got her daughter too with child. FABLE VII. A flock of Cranes newly come over, Buried in wheat up to the throat, Like oxen rioting in clover, Were taken at their table d'hôte. Amongst the set Thus taken up for vagrant game, A Stork was found in the same net, Pretending to be sick and lame. With whining voice, and face of brass, Just like a rogue with a false pass, Seiz'd with a fainting fit, 'Tis but a moment since I lit; For filial duty in all ages Our house, said he, was ever noted, By all philosophers and sages, By poets male and female quoted: My name is Stork, the Cranes will own No way related to their clan; I should as soon digest a stone As either corn or bran. Believe not me, trust your own eyes; Take and examine us by pairs, Our feathers are of different dyes: How different mine is from theirs! Neither your colour nor digestion, The farmer cried, is now the question; That you were taken in this place, And in their company, is plain But, for the honour of your race, You shall be punish'd as a Crane. Just so, one of the sacred bench Was caught in criminal conversation, Not with a juicy tempting wench, That's an excusable temptation. Caught in the fact, for so the story is, Of prostitution amongst Tories. What do you think was his defence? The metropolitan of ? Exclaim'd, appeal'd to common sense, Argu'd exactly like a Stork: Examine their's and my pen-feather; Birds of so different a plume, You will confess, I do presume, Can never copulate together. But, in Crim. Con. having been taken, This could not save his holy bacon. FABLE VIII. A gnat upon an Ox's horn, Clapping his wings, sang forth his praise, Greater than the Unicorn: Hail, greatest beast of al that graze! Accept, great brute, my willing strain; And, if my weight give you no pain, Which I much fear, Allow me to remain To charm your bovine ear: Great and mighty Chieftain, say, Whether shall I go or stay? The Ox replied, Where insignificance prevails, You always meet with empty pride; Depend upon't, it never fails: To me, vain insect, 'tis the same, You may give over, or go on; I neither felt you when you came, Nor shall I miss you when you're gone. Said Maupertuis, Pray, read this Fable, And I'll explain it to the table. Observe Voltaire, that chirps and sings Near Prussia's King from night to morn; He is the Gnat that claps his wings, And sings upon the Ox's horn: Voltaire replied, the Gnat suits me; But why an Ox? there I am dull; As for the Ox, said Maupertuis, I wish the Ox had been a Bull If there is any meaning in these four last lines of the author, of which I hold him guiltless, to use the words of Jean Jaques, “ce n'est que pour ceux, qui ont (la Tact) l'odorat fin,” he should have said. Smellfungus.. FABLE IX. Once on a time a man of fashion, Æsop has told it you before, In love, and blinded by his passion, At Athens wed a common whore. The whore, transported with devotion, Leaving her lovers in the lurch, And also proud of her promotion, Attended daily the Greek church. Venus, to whom she made her prayers, Rated her soundly in her sleep: You strumpet, give yourself no airs; Your prayers, said she, and incense keep: Not for your sake, nor for your vows, I gave your ladyship your spouse, Nor, like dame Fortune, for a whim; It was because in twenty places He had affronted all the Graces; In short, because I hated him. My Lord has made a vile buffoon His bosom friend, the Graces cried; Good gracious Venus, grant our boon, Give him a harlot for his bride. Tho' chaste, the Graces are so gay, Venus herself is so delighted, So taken with their winning way, She hates all those by whom they're slighted. FABLE X. Let him alone; he's a Reviewer: By such vile trash he gets his bread; And for that reason, soyez sure, He well deserves a broken head. A Flea out of a blanket shaken, A bloody-minded sinner, Upon a Tailor's neck was taken, Marauding for a dinner. The Flea attempted a defence; The damage was so small, That the offence Was next to none, or none at all; And furthermore, to save his life, Pleaded his children and poor wife. That's not the case, the Judge reply'd, The harm is small, 'tis not deny'd; You did your worst, and had your fill: Die then, said he, Unrighteous Flea, Not for the deed; but for the will. FABLE XI. An Eagle pick'd up a young Lamb, Carelessly sporting by her Dam, Too feeble to protect and guard her: Aloft you might have seen her swing, Just like a Lamb on a hook-ring, Swinging suspended in a larder. The bird kept mounting to the sky, Till, like a paper-kite, Lessen'd each instant to the eye, He vanish'd out of sight. A Jack Daw on a steeple top, First taking a delib'rate hop, Resolv'd to try what he could do; Resolv'd the Eagle to excell, Down, like a bird of prey, he fell, To seize, and carry off, the Ewe: His feet entangled in the wool, Neither Jack's wings nor paper-skull Could rescue him from his mishap. A Shepherd, summon'd by John's noise, Took him, and, to divert his boys, Trimm'd him, and gave him a fool's cap. Now, Jack, said he, now, if you will, Fancy yourself an Eagle still.— So have I seen, you know the place, A Coxcomb, with a Jack Daw's wit, Rise, with a pert unmeaning face, To emulate the Eagle Pitt; As fit to speak or to reply, As Æsop's Tortoise was to fly; Struggle and strain to be distinguish'd, Floundering and stammering evermore, Then drop, eternally extinguish'd In one contemptuous farewell roar. 'Tis pertness makes Jack hop and chatter; Pertness makes all weak people weaker; Nothing but courage, strength, and matter, Can make a thunder-bearing speaker. FABLE XII. Sucking his paws for his diversion, A Bear, a huge mis-shapen mass, Beheld a Fox, with great aversion, Picking the bones of a dead Ass. I never touch the dead, said Bruin, Nor break their sacred rest, like you, To whom destruction and dire ruin, For such a wicked act, is due. With a sly grin, the Fox reply'd, My learned Friend, we differ wide; Pray heaven, that you and all your kin Would take a fancy to such fare! To eat the dead is no great sin, It is the living you should spare. Your piety I understand; You, Sir, and all your brethren, chuse To fit yourselves with those at hand, Rather than wait for dead folks shoes. Happy are they that have no dealings With Bears of nice and tender feelings! Says Crito the benign: Crito would sooner lose his head Than vent his spleen By speaking evil of the dead. Crito, you talk and look profoundly, But pr'ythee, with that heart of steel, Revile the dead, and maul them soundly; Flea none but those that cannot feel. Your cruel pastime, Junius, cease: Had you been just to honour and to fame, Had you let Virtue sleep in peace, And lash'd those only that are dead to shame; I should have cry'd, why let him slash, I like both Junius and his plan; None but a knave need fear his lash, For Brutus is an honourable man. FABLE XIII. A serpent sly, With thoughtful head and watchful eye, Had got out of a thousand scrapes, Either by wriggling or back-sliding, By circumvention or by gliding; In short, in many shapes. Without the least pretence To consequence or common sense, With volubility indeed, The tail, affecting to be great, Envied the head her judgement-seat, And tried to take the lead. Some members openly dissented; Some were won over, some afraid; The major part at last consented, The head was shamefully betray'd. Without an eye, a nose, an ear, Without the semblance of a brain, Without a grain of wit or fear, Madame la Queue began her reign, And thus equipp'd began her ramble, Tearing and scratching the poor Snake; But though she passed through thorn or bramble, She wheel'd at every stone or stake; 'Twas that by which she was preserv'd, By flexibility alone, Those tails have always been observ'd Most flexible that have least bone: They yield to any slight impression; Whereas an obstinate stiff rump Maintains her ground, and keeps possession, And moves for neither shove nor thump The head, that had not slept a wink, Caught her at last fast in a chink; With sanguine eyes and pallid hue, La Tête advanc'd steady and clear, Came round, and disengag'd La Queue, And made her fall into the rear.— When they are first that should be last, It shall be now as in times past, When they, that were ordain'd to trail, Presume to take the lead and guide, They must return and be the tail, Or be cut off and laid aside. FABLE XIV. A fox contriv'd, tho' lock'd and barr'd, —Contrivance was the Fox's trade— To steal into a Farmer's yard, A la sourdine, by escalade; With appetites wicked and loose, Improv'd by travelling and art, He suck'd the blood out of a Goose, Ravish'd a Hen, and broke her heart. To put an end to these lewd courses, Before the caitiff was aware, Surrounding him with all his forces, The Farmer caught him in a snare. He studied till he crack'd his brains, The writers of those times relate, To find out penalties and pains, To suit his cruelty and hate; Revenge will help you at a pinch, E'en when your parts begin to fail. To make Volpone die inch by inch, He tied a fire-brand to his tail. The Fox ran straight to Hodge's corn, And caus'd as great a conflagration, As when Wilkes came and blew his horn, That, like the last trump, rous'd the nation: Turn'd out of doors with an intention To get him basted well, and roasted. What did they get by their invention? Get! Why they got him nicely toasted. With Bills of Rights to his tail tied, With red-hot Humphry Humphry Cotes. too he came, And more combustibles beside, That set all Brentford in a flame. The ruin spread, and made such haste, For all the engines they employ'd, The neighbouring towns were soon lay'd waste, And Middlesex was quite destroy'd: The flames reach'd London; but anon The wind chop'd round, or London too had gone. Both these examples are complete; I wish some folks would learn from hence To know that no revenge is sweet, Without a little common sense. FABLE XV. THE PETITIONERS FOR A DISSOLUTION OF THE PEAR TREE. A pear-tree fell into disgrace, Exhausting all its strength in leaves, An idle occupant of space, A shelter, and a den for thieves, For birds, perpetually merry, As long as there was plumb or cherry, The Orchard, in an ill condition, Complain'd to Colin they were plunder'd; To their long grumbling petition, He only shook his head and wonder'd; But took at last a resolution, To cut the useless Pear-tree down. This was a right of dissolution, Inherent clearly in the Clown. Colin in short the ax apply'd, And made a rupture in the Tree; When lo! there issued from its side In streams, the labours of the Bee. As Henry the Eighth replied, Sweetheart—Good Catharine, he cried, You go, said he, at a fine rate; I vow, you're in a pleasant vein: Continue in this humour, Kate, The birds and you shall both remain. How could they ever sing so sweet, If our poor birds had naught to eat? Remain, said he; our humours suit, Your honey overpays their fruit. FABLE XVI. THE WHEELS OF GOVERNMENT. A team of Oxen fat and fair, Resign'd to every Bumkin's goad, With little feeling and less care, Were marching with a heavy load. During the march, the Wheels alone Cry'd out, and made a grievous moan. Pleas'd with the hint, Cæsar turn'd round: My Lord, said he, this is good ground; Faction makes all that noise and rumbling: The People, that bear all the weight, That drag the waggon of the state, March, like the Oxen, without grumbling. Faction applies not to the wheels, That go so heavily and lag on, Replied the Keeper of the Seals, Faction does not retard the waggon: The reason then they go so ill, Is want of grease, not want of will. The K?'s friends must be duly paid, The wheels of Government want greasing; Business of course must be delay'd, And cause the noise that's so displeasing. FABLE XVII. A fragrant Rose, in vernal bloom, Close by a pensive Myrtle grew; A melancholy jealous gloom Darken'd the Myrtle's native hue. O happy Rose! Myrtilla cry'd, Thy sweets unrivall'd yet by art, Fairest of flowers, she said, and sigh'd, Thy blushes warm and win the heart. Whilst all conspire to fan thy pride, To me, like a neglected maid, Attending joyless on a bride, Nought but cold compliments are paid. The Rose reply'd, Myrtilla cease; Why will you envy me my day? Why will you interrupt your peace? You may please long, if you'll be gay. The Rose's dower is short-liv'd praise, Vigour is yours, and length of days. Chloe, love Admiration less, Love solid Truth, and Virtue more; Then you will do what, I profess, No woman ever did before. Then Chloe, be for ever mine, A Myrtle true, not one of those That, like Myrtilla, sigh and pine For all the lovers of the Rose. FABLE XVIII. A hungry Crow, lean as a stick, Beating about his hunting ground, To find, amongst the dead or quick, A dinner, if it could be found, Perceiv'd a Serpent lying basking, This is a glorious Worm indeed! One may dine here; there is no need, Said he, to wait for any asking. On which Don Corvo cock'd his tail, And strutted in the gutter; Resolv'd to fall to, tooth and nail, When he had carv'd and cut her. Instead of making a good dinner, Or making a good hit, Corvo, like many a foolish sinner, Found himself miserably bit. Too late he found out his mistake; Passion minds nothing but the form, Passion will seize upon a snake, And take it for a harmless Worm. This Fable in his hand, a Miser Said to his son, 'Tis hard to tell How many people would be wiser, If they apply'd this Fable well; You might have sav'd, said he, dear Will, Many a good pound and many a pill. The son reply'd, How folks are blind! I find it otherwise apply'd, It means an avaricious mind, That never can be satisfy'd. With hunger, toils, and danger struggling, Till, bit for want of taking heed, Some cunning Serpent makes him bleed, As you were made to bleed for smuggling. FABLE XIX. A fox, with Death before his eyes, And at his back The Furies, with their whips and cries, Encouraging the hellish pack, Stood on a precipice's brink, Having but little time to think: Of Friends of every kind And all resources now bereft, Presence of mind Was all the Fox had left. Upon the rock he spy'd a ledge, And on the ledge, either a bush With thorns and brambles, or a hedge, Where he propos'd to make a push; He thought, if he could drop down plum, At worst he could but lose his brush, And scarify his bum. Accordingly, he had the luck To drop into the midst of all; Where for some time he hung and stuck, And, hanging, broke his fall; But found his calculation fail, Entirely wrong from head to tail. The Fox was safe whilst he held fast, But was so mangled, rent, and torn, By Bramble and tenacious Thorn, He left his hold at last; Got to his journey's end, he cry'd, With broken leg and bloody hide, This is the way it always ends, And so it should, and ever will, When one lays hold of Rogues for Friends, Trusting their honesty and skill. If you had fallen quite from the top, The Brambles answer'd one and all, If you had never made a stop, And never given us a call, Crush'd all to pieces like an egg, You would not have got off so well, Nor had so good a tale to tell About a broken leg. To keep out of Oppression's paw, Oblig'd to Westminster to ramble, You lay fast hold upon the Law, And hang on Lawyer Thorn and Serjeant Bramble. When you have hung on Thorns and Briers, I mean these keen blood-drawing Lawyers, And hung as long as you well could, Think not to 'scape at any rate, Till you have left them half your blood, And lost a limb of your estate; On this, and only this condition, The Law may save you from perdition. FABLE XX. Hector, a faithful Spaniel, spy'd His nephew, by a river side, A youth entirely free from guile, Running, but never taking heed, As if he took it for the Tweed, And had forgot it was the Nile. On which, with eager pace, Hector set out, and gave him chace. Prince turn'd, and ask'd, Why all this hurry? Fearless and calm when others fear, But, when there is no danger near, My uncle's always in a flurry. Mind, Prince, cry'd Hector, what I say, You little know what traps and snares You may fall into unawares, If you run headlong in this way. Old folks, said Prince, are too suspicious, They fancy all our youthful hours Are spent in riot and amours, When they were young, they were so vicious: But you must know I am no suitor: So far from gallantry and courting, Or running after idle sporting, Know, I am running to my tutor, Whose wise and learned conversation, Let that suffice for your conjecture, I do prefer, good uncle Hector, To all the Bitches in the nation. That instant, from his oozy bed, A Crocodile put forth his snout, A sludge-wrapp'd bonnet hid his head, Entirely like a dirty clout. From that unhappy day, said Prince, The fatal news came by a Hound, You know, both then and ever since, We gave my mother up for drown'd. But my good friend there in the mud Has told me how that matter stood, Which either my good friend or I, Will tell you, uncle, by and by. The Cubs, my brothers, have the measles, My sisters look as thin as Weazles; And our physician Doctor Curr Declares, as sure as they're alive, 'Twould kill them but to wet their furr; Then how the devil should they dive? So I am going to fulfil, To which you can have no objection, My blessed mother's blessed will, And study under her inspection. I was to bring her the whole Litter; But let them stay till they are fitter. Said Crocodile, then let them wait, Till they have leave of their Physician; They must not stir at any rate, Unless they have Dr. Curr's permission: But if you go, said he to Hector, The news will not so much affect her. Now, to your mother's praise and glory, I'll tell your uncle here her story: Struck with the beauty of that Dame, As on a bank she laid asleep; Our God, the God Anubis came, And hurry'd her into the deep. Though she was married to a God, And the sole partner of his bed, Her cubs, which was exceeding odd, Were always running in her head. Anubis, willing to assist her, In order to remove her grief, Made a proposal to your sister That gave immediate relief:— To keep them near her for the future, And to appoint me for their tutor. Dido, said he, trust to my friend (Our Crocodile let fall a tear), To Pharoah, here, I recommend, Your house, and all that you hold dear; Believe me, he will spare no pains, To cultivate their tender brains. One of your sons Pharoah will find, Close by the hill, and by and by Pharoah will bring you your young fry, And you'll be easy in your mind. And now, said Pharoah, here I am, You need not stand to haw and hum, I'll soon convey you to your dam; And Hector too, if he will come Besides the visit to your mother, 'Tis highly worth your uncle's while To see the fountain of the Nile, He never will see such another. If I had never seen your charms, Your bonnet nor your snout at all; I knew you by your coat of arms; It hangs, said Hector, in our hall. I am engag'd to my great sorrow: As to my nephew, here, said he, He must go back to day with me, He may return to you to—morrow. Pharoah, perceiving 'twas in vain To deal with Hector in that strain, Came forth, to Prince's great surprize, Shewing his horrid coat of mail, His dreadful jaws and wicked tail, Exhibited without disguise. Wheel to the left, cry'd Hector, quick; With Crocodiles when you are dealing, Keep them continually wheeling, You will soon make the monsters sick. Thus forc'd to quit the field in choler, Pharoah return'd, and lost his scholar. Beset with fraud on ev'ry side, With crocodiles in every street, 'Tis dangerous, without a guide, For youth to advance or to retreat. In Westminster, how oft, at play, Unguarded boys are snatch'd away! FABLE XXI. The Cavalry for cart and plough Once on a time were much abus'd, As badly fed and as ill us'd, As thistle-eating Asses now. This dietetic alteration Was owing partly to a peace, And partly to the great increase Of folly like an inundation. That is, to the increase of Hunters, Racers for Ladies, Pads for Bunters; Of Routs, Assemblies, and, of course, Cuckoldom simple and alone; And Cuckoldom in the bon ton, Compounded with Divorce; Which run on wheels, and swell th'account Of Horses to a vast amount. By this increase, it was observ'd, And, from the great decrease of corn, The labouring Horse was almost starv'd, A thing not to be born; And thereupon they all profess'd, In presence of the buinham Lord, Unless their wrongs were soon redress'd, Their right and lawful feed restor'd, These Carters would renounce the yoak, The plough and cart might both stand still, They would not move a wheel nor spoak Against their own free will. A headstrong Steed Cry'd out, with indignation fir'd, Do as your masters have requir'd; Or, like vile rebels, you shall bleed. Shall we be stinted in our Oats, For base-born Cattle, such as you? Sooner we'll help to cut your throats, Than lose an atom of our due. Go, scoundrels, pick yon common bare, Your freehold, and your proper fare. Poor Grey! reply'd one of the blacks, This talk, methinks, is silly talk, For one long us'd to drudge and walk, And crouch, beneath a miller's sacks. We find, in these degenerate days, The best pack-horses are the Greys; And furthermore, when we are dead, Hung up, and punish'd to your mind, The greatest slaves, at last, you'll find, Will be the highest bred. FABLE XXII. FANCY See Fontaine's Fables, 1745.. Struck with a block of Parian stone, In a repository lying; Though he had many of his own, A sculptor could not pass it without buying. Henceforth, he cry'd, be it my part Thy latent, modest worth to blaze; Say, shall I make thee, by my art, A God, a tripod, or a vase? Be thou a God, and, if I please, The God whose bolts at pride are hurl'd; Tremble, mankind, down on your knees, Behold the Sovereign of the world! Far as an artist's power can reach, Jupiter, it was confess'd, Throughout, in every thing but speech, Divinely was express'd. 'Tis said his art went farther still, That he was the first dupe of his own skill. His work, it seems, was scarce completed, When lo! with reverential awe, From an imagination heated, In his, the real God he saw. Fix'd, like his Jupiter he stood, Fear stopp'd the current of his blood. Poets asleep, and poets waking, Have also now and then been found, And some with heads reputed sound, Frighten'd at Gods of their own making. And folks in love are often smitten, Contrary to their intention, And are as often sadly bitten By creatures of their own invention. You sigh for Chloe, heavenly fair, But you must ever sigh in vain; Chloe, whose cruel chains you wear, Lives only in your brain. Let fancy trace out a conceit, And draw some beautiful deception, Passion will catch at the deceit, And take it under her protection. 'Tis done, she is your's for evermore; Chloe, 'tis true, Belongs to you, But not the Chloe you adore. Your husbands, ladies, are quite wrong, They represent you in false lights; The burthen of a husband's song Is, one and all—they all are bites. Alas! thy wife is not to blame, There was no fallacy in Nan, Thy injur'd wife is still the same, Eadem semper, like queen Anne: Serene with Nants, fat with October, Eadem semper, never sober. You bit yourself; had you the wit, You would continue to be bit. As upon clouds the varying wind, So fancy acts upon the mind; Blows vernal gales, and paints the skies With angel forms that charm the eyes. But oh! delicious, flattering gales, Boreas is coming with his storms, Black clouds, like crocodiles and whales, Will drive away your angel forms. Fontaine's remark is deep and sly— We're all, says he, both age and youth, Warm in the interest of a lye, And cold as ice for naked truth. Why not, if naked truth be frightful, And fiction dress'd appear delightful? It is a universal foible; Fontaine is read from morn till night, By people that take no delight Over the Gospel or the Bible. Fiction is like a mistress gay, Truth like a wife. Would you, Sir, chuse To hear dull truths day after day Rather than fictions that amuse? Dull, naked truth, in case of need, I own, does well enough in bed, For there, and only there, indeed, Her mercury, attracts her lead. But not enough, I have a notion, To give the lead sufficient motion. We all can magnify our ills; It requires none, or little art, To turn our bon-bons into pills, Or make a bolus of a tart. To make a sweetmeat of a pill, Requires some fancy, and more skill. From whence there follows, with great ease, This truth, not easily defeated— We may be wretched when we please, But to be happy must be cheated.— May all that cannot do without them, All husbands, and all virtuous wives, Carry their remedy about them, And be impos'd on all their lives! May both of them do one or t'other, Deceive themselves, or cheat each other! FABLE XXIII. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE CUNNING. A lion, with a wand'ring gout, Upon his couch or bed lay roaring; The Courtiers all stood round about, Every God and aid imploring. Excruciated like a martyr, The Doctors brought a thousand slops, To pave the way for his departure, They pour'd them down the Lion's chops. Of all the Courtiers that attended, Waiting about him in a ring, The Wolf officiously pretended To sympathize most with the King. Whilst we are all in such a fright, Sir, said the Wolf, it must appear Extremely wrong, in every light, That your Attorney is not here. My friend the Fox is much to blame, Now that your Majesty's so ill, To roam about killing your game, Bound by no laws but his own will. He is the chief lord paramount, And one would swear your forest-laws Were only made on his account, To fill his guts and grease his paws. A selfishness and inattention, Which otherwise I should not mention: When our salvation is at stake, When every one should watch and pray, When every eye should be awake, 'Tis highly criminal, I say. I say, that such a gross neglect, In one that has the Royal ear, Cannot but argue disrespect, The consequence of which I fear. Such subjects seldom, by design, Stop at the disrespectful line. At his return the Fox was told How handsomely his friend had serv'd him; His spite at me is very old, Says Master Fox, I have observ'd him. Only because I go a fowling, Am rich, and entertain my friends; Whilst he, for very hunger howling, Is fit to eat his fingers ends. Volpone that instant ran to court, Salutes the Wolf quite frank and hearty; The Monarch cry'd, Had you good sport, Sir Reynard? who was of your party? Your Majesty, says the Attorney, Is misinform'd about my journey. That I was hunting is most true, Making the strictest perquisitions, Amongst the Magi and Physicians, To find a remedy for you. When your Gout's fix'd, or quite remov'd, Then, Sir, my care and pious zeal, For you, and for the common-weal, Will be acknowledg'd and approv'd. In the mean time I must proceed To tell my sovereign Lord his cure; His royal heart, I know, will bleed, I feel myself what he'll endure. 'Tis the advice of a wise Hermit, A recipe I cannot term it, Of a profound and learned Boar, Whose hermitage is in a wood, Who pores and studies evermore, And studies only to do good. A Wolf must presently be got, In such a case it is no sin, Flay him alive, and piping hot Wrap the King up in the Wolf's skin. Thus, Sir, if you will be directed, Your pains will quickly be abated, The morbid matter be ejected, And health and vigour reinstated. The Lion, rising from his seat, Order'd the Wolf to rest content, To lie down prostrate at his feet, And patiently wait the event. That done, he call'd his Surgeons in; Flay me, said he, that Wolf completely, Flay him alive, but flay him neatly, Or you may spoil his honour's skin. The brains of Wolves, as some report, Are in the grinders of the brute; Contrivance is not the Wolf's fort; Beasts without scent ought to hunt mute; Their howling spreads such an alarm, They very seldom do much harm.— Had the Wolf let the Fox alone, Had he not forc'd him to contrive, He might have sav'd his skin and bone, He would not have been flay'd alive.— To try his cunning and his art, A would-be minister of State, Dup'd by his own malicious heart, Now and then meets with the same fate. May all that follow the Wolf's trade In the same coin be always paid! FABLE XXIV. THE MOLE. With intellects by nature muddy, A Mole kept moiling under ground, Liv'd like Dun Scotus, in his study, And got the name of The Profound. At length by labouring and boring, Amongst the blind and the benighted, And by continually poring, He was accounted second-sighted, Thoroughly vers'd in every part And mystery of the black-art. In short, the studies of the blind Are always of the occult kind. As clear as you can see at noon He saw, according to report, What folks were doing in the Moon And were undoing about Court. Such was the Doctor's great renown, All kinds of people, young and old, Came and address'd the velvet gown, Eager to have their fortunes told. His mother, a discreet old dame, Knew well the genius of the youth; She was not such a dupe to Fame To take all her reports for truth. Down she descends, without a rap, And finds him about half awake, Just in that studious kind of nap That your great students often take. Mother, said he, by all that's bright, I saw you tripping o'er the plain; What a fine thing is second-sight, A fine illuminated brain; I knew you, mother, well enough; I heard your step an hour ago, And smelt the fragrance of your ruff, As I was studying below. That you, said she, were always blind, Was not a point that wanted clearing; But now, alas! I also find, You've neither feeling, smell, nor hearing. When you set up to botanize, I prov'd, to cure you of your folly, You could not judge, by your own eyes, Between a Thistle and a Holly. But when you talk of second-sight, Let your internal light so shine, That not one soul shall by that light Find out a meaning or design. Therefore, to keep your reputation, Few words are best, my learned son; Avoid all kind of conversation— If you converse you are undone. They may consult you, if they will, But always keep in the same walk, Keep studying and conjuring still, Let all your talk be conjuring talk. For few folks pay, with a good grace, For any thing they understand; Nonsense is quite another case, 'Tis the best trade throughout the land: Else how should doctors fare so well, And other trades that I could tell? FABLE XXV. The KING and the COBLER. A cobler, in a sorry plight, Chang'd his profession, and turn'd Quack, Shut up his stall, and took his flight, With his whole fortune on his back. From mending shoes, to a Physician, Or to a mender of the state, Is no such violent transition, Nor an old tale quite out of date. An orator that speaks off hand, A speaker for the public good, Is not oblig'd, I understand, To make himself be understood: But if his speeches bring him pelf, You're sure he understands himself. The Cobler did not speak like Nestor, Whose words fell soft as flakes of snow, Nor like Thersites, the old jester, But like some orators we know. His oratory cost him nought, His lungs were made of cobler's leather, The words ran off as quick as thought, Rapid and clutter'd all together; A kind of hurricane oration, A whirlwind, with an inundation. Or like a rapid roaring torrent, Full of confusion and disasters, With cattle swimming down the current, And fishes laying in the pastures; Cottages, houses, meadows, wood, Standing in water or in mud. Speaking was not his surest card, The best was of his own invention; It was an antidote to guard Against all poison you could mention. Its fame was spread through every quarter, And all folks drank it like Tar-water. God bless his Majesty; the King, Like other folks, had got a cold, On which the Courtiers in the ring Observ'd that some folks were grown bold. From thence it went through every rout, In whispers, whisper'd very low, The King was poison'd, without doubt, By poison that would poison slow. The King was speedily appriz'd Of what folks said, and all folks thought, And by the Cabinet advis'd To take the Cobler's antidote. He would have taken it, I fear, Had it not been for a wise Seer. Sir, what your ministers advise, Suppose the fact be true, indeed, Said he, may be extremely wise; But let them on sure ground proceed. Order the Doctor to appear, And then I'll make this matter clear. The Cobler was directly call'd, A glass of water stood prepar'd, The cobling Doctor stood appall'd, The King and all the Courtiers star'd. Take, said the Seer, this glass and view it: Doctor, said he, if you're so clever, To take this potion, and subdue it, Your fame and fortune's fix'd for ever. That it is poison is most true, The worse, the deadlier the draught, The greater honour will be due To your alexipharmic craft. Now, Doctor, you must shew your skill; Whip them off clean, and make your will. The Cobler fell upon his knees: I own, said he, my want of knowledge, And also own that my degrees Were taken at the Coblers college: For want of practice, and from hunger, I turn'd a counter-poison monger. Let it not cause the least alarm, I'll answer for it with my blood, It can do no one any harm, But may do fanciful folks good. In short, 'tis neither more nor less, 'Tis my own water, I confess. Then, turning to the King, the Seer Said, pray Sir, ask your good friends here, What their advice was built upon, What they could mean, what were their views, To let you trust your life with one That none would trust with their old shoes. So long betray'd, so long deceiv'd, The King reply'd, I'm truly griev'd. These rogues, that gave themselves such airs, That made bad worse, are fairly trapp'd; These coblers shall be kick'd down stairs, Turn'd out, and all be soundly strapp'd. Sir, said the Seer, after their flogging, Pray give me leave to make a motion, That every one shall take a noggin Of Doctor Strap's salubrious potion; 'Twill either prove a mild emetic, A gentle purge, or diuretic. Mind, Doctor, cry'd the King, and laugh'd, Do you take care that every man Drink the King's health in a full can, And pay you for your cordial draught. Now, said the King, I am quite fast, All kind of menders I have try'd; The menders of the other side Cobbled exactly like the last. When my two doctors disagree, To drive out both, with resolution To trust to a good constitution And temperance is best for me. FABLE XXVI. THE INDEPENDENT OXEN AND THE GRAND ALLIES. Four powerful Oxen, fat as bacon, One weigh'd a hundred stone at least, As brave, for all he was a capon, As Captain Bull, at a bull-feast; I mean a Bull with his young bride, And her bride-maidens, by his side. These Oxen never could be parted, Either by foes, or stress of weather; They neither fear'd, flinch'd, nor started, When all their horns were clubb'd together: Even the Lion's roaring pride, With all his terrors, they defy'd. Whoever had contriv'd to fat 'em, Their buttocks look'd so plump and nice, The Lion fain would have been at 'em, The Lion long'd for a good slice: But he had sense enough to know, They did not wear their horns for show. As to the Lion's knowledge-box, His headpiece was not worth a rush; The Lion's chancellor, the Fox, Had far more knowledge in his brush. Jackall was sent, the Fox's friend, To bid the chancellor attend. A Fox is not a royal treat, And therefore Reynard might rely on, Unless he had nothing else to eat, The word and honour of a Lion. The Fox perceiv'd, by Jack's report, Deliver'd with a savoury smell, That peace and plenty reign'd at court, That the King's stores were furnish'd well. On which he set out with Jackall, Obedient to the Lion's call. Treated with a most gracious smile, Instead of a most hearty meal, They both were thank'd, in the old style, For their great loyalty and zeal. The royal paw of course was kiss'd, And Jack purveyor was dismiss'd. Fox, said the King, weigh well this matter— Four Oxen are encamp'd hard by, There never were four eunuchs fatter, Nor any eunuchs half so sly: Bestir yourself, my learned chief, Contrive to put these friends asunder, If you have any love for beef, Or any love for lawful plunder. The fat tid-bits, the choicest meat, Their lights and livers, tongues, and hearts, Fall to your Lordship by escheat, With all their tripes and inward parts. To work goes Reynard with his brains, Finds out, and thus harangues our cattle: The greatest sovereign of the plains, Offers you peace, or deadly battle. I am the Lion's plenipo, His gracious intent I know; His Majesty had rather far You should chuse peace, for your own sakes; Whoever is dispos'd for war Should know the task he undertakes.— Are you prepar'd to bid defiance, Against so powerful an alliance? The King will march with his allies, Tigers and Leopards in his pay, With wolves of an enormous size, Tartars, that only fight for prey; Unless you banish from your states That insolent enormous beast, A brute that every creature hates; That only lives to cram and feast. 'Tis your own interest, depend on't, 'Tis obvious to common sense; Declare yourselves quite independent, Banish your tyrant far from hence. Extend your trade, encrease your food— All the King's views are for your good. By tyranny and usurpations, To what a bulk the monster's grown! Whilst you, by bars and limitations, Must be reduc'd to skin and bone. Many, with looks profound and wise, To cunning fall a sacrifice; And thus their chief, by threats and art, Was driven out and forc'd to run; Their wisest head, and stoutest heart, They lost at once, and were undone: For when their main support was gone, All four were pick'd up one by one. Reader, perhaps you are not able To mark the Actors in the fable: I do not know, myself, the Fox, But England is the monstrous Ox: If you can't guess the other three, You'll never be inform'd by me. The Lion is—you'll not guess soon, A royal house—house of Baboon— The grand Baboon of Monkey-land Has the whole house at his command. A FRAGMENT OF AN EPIC POEM. BOOK IV. Musæum, ante omnes, medium, nam plurima turba, Hunc habet, atque humeris extantem suspicit omnes Dicite Fælices Animæ, Tuque Optime vates Quæ Regio Anchisen, quis habet Locus? illius ergo Venimus, et magnos Erebi tranavimus amnes. ARGUMENT. The hero applies to a sorceress, called a Spey-Wife—she informs him of what is necessary for him to do to accomplish his desire of visiting the Infernal Regions, conducts him, blindfold, to the brink of a deep pit near the Spey, called the Witches hole; where he is to remain upon his knees during the Magic Rites—Incantation—Instruction—Voyage to Hell—The Paradise of Blessed Fools. Evening came on, and with the setting sun The rites were ended, and the charm was done. The Beldam Spey-wife bade the Hero rise, And bade him take the bandage from his eyes. All is prepar'd, your equipage is ready; Speed you my son, she said, be bold and steady. The moment that he saw, where he was led; His head forsook him, like a moon-struck head, And, as a roosted turkey, staring drops, His head quite lost, into a Fox's chops, The chief fell headlong down the vast profound, Nor felt himself, before he felt the ground; Then felt at once 'twas hell; but knew no more How he came there than Dives did before. Treading the dreary waste, with feet unbless'd, His shoulders mounted high above the rest, He spied, amidst a crew of perjur'd dead The Jacobites, that took the oaths to government., Old Samuel, shaking his Colossean head; Filmer before, Sacheverell in the rear, With unbelieving David An Epicurean Philosopher of the North, in whom were united the principles of two sects, seemingly opposite—a Pyrrhonist in Revelation; a Dogmatist in Faction, who does not believe God's word, but will take a Tory's word for any thing., and Shebbeare; St. John pass'd by, and Prior laughing loud, Pointing to Paul A Poet Laureat of the same name and of the same time with the present; but not the same King., with Dashwood in the crowd; Bolingbroke wheeling stopp'd, and with surprise Cried out, By G?, I scarce can trust my eyes! Mat, turn about, as sure as we are damn'd, There's M?y, kissing Dr. Samuel's hand. How could the quibbling casuist contrive To cheat our master Some read his master; but our master is better; for he was certainly their master: whether he was his or no, might be guessed by his works; but could only be known by himself. It is remarkable, that those who seldom speak truth upon earth, are never permitted to lie here. No person dare speak affirmatively but from knowledge. To be obliged to speak truth must be a terrible punishment for a liar—and to none so much as a Liar ex Officio., and get here alive? The Reverend Chieftain of the Law, you'll guess, Had reach'd the Ancient Chieftain of the Press. To Samuel, thus, the chief address'd his speech, “Spirit of Night, profound didactic Leech; And, ye attendants, say; you know too well, Where dwells your King that sent you all to hell?” To whom the Seer reply'd, with bellowing voice, “Here we have room enough; but little choice, As upon earth; in this sequester'd vale We have no certain dwelling, but a jail: Thither, at certain periods, we repair, At certain periods wander here and there. 'Tis neither East nor West, nor North nor South, We live as heretofore, from hand to mouth. M?d go on, you have not far to go, Down in that bottom lies the seat of woe. There you will find the Sovereign of your heart, Your King, still acting the same drivelling part.” “But, says the Doctor, with a Cynick sneer, What do you think of our grand landscapes here? I have seen just such scenes up in your North, Is not that solemn river like your Forth? The lofty banks of Forth, that so delight us, Are in the taste of these, along Cocytus.” This said, the Chief, without the least reply, Bowed, and pursued his journey with a sigh As every one is not endowed with the gift of discerning, nor with a taste for relishing the delicacy of an allegory, which is the soul of an heroic Poem, it will not be amiss to inform the Reader, that this laborious journey to the Infernal Regions means no more than the dry study and unpleasant drudgery of a certain science which the sublimest genius must submit to before he can reach the height of his profession—When he is at the top, and mounted upon his tribunal, he has hell in full view; for he must necessarily, like Rhadamanthus, be made acquainted with every crime and every kind of iniquity, that entitles human nature to be virtually represented in that senate.. Joyless, he labour'd, through the barren sand, Oft stroak'd his wig, and often pinch'd his band: Arriv'd—the Porter hail'd him with a grin, The gates flew open, and he enter'd in. The first he fix'd his eyes upon was Laud, With pontiff curses swearing like a bawd, Leading the Martyr Charles through thick and thin, Scourg'd for ten thousand years, and scourg'd by Prynne. Stenny he saw, along with daddy James, Tied back to back, and both impail'd in flames. His other Paramours, all in a row, Were all impail'd, up to the waist in snow. And farther on, continuing his rout, He saw a black and dismal head peep out, Out of a boiling cauldron, through the smoke, Just like the head, out of the Royal Oak. Two figures next approach'd, in monkish weeds, Muttering fantastic prayers, and dropping beads. The two last James's, walking with bead-rolls, Condemn'd to pray in vain for all their souls; For ages doom'd, in that devoted pound To walk, incessantly, their foolish round. Hook'd by the ribs, on a high gibbet, hung Kirk; still retaining his audacious tongue, Cried, as they pass'd, 'tis certain—tho' 'tis hard, The prayers of fools can never fly a yard. Nothing can ever make these blockheads wise— How do you think that yours can mount the skies? Arm'd with credentials from the Cocoa-tree Down dropp'd the chief upon his bended knee; Father and son both eyed him with dismay, Both of them cross'd themselves, and walk'd away. A dreadful cave now struck his soul with awe, Here were the baleful caverns of the law. Blue lightnings issued forth, and from within His ears were harrow'd with terrific din, Chains, lashes, creaking wheels, and crackling bones, Yells, horrid shrieks, and everlasting groans. Before the entrance two grim monsters lay, With many monster cubs, in snarling play, Chicane the dam, and rapine was their sire, Their mouths foam'd black, their eyes were balls of fire: Hell-hounds, the likest to a wolf in make, A lion's paw, their tail a hooded snake The Cobro Capello or Coiffed-head, the most deadly of all serpents.; The Chief mov'd forward, till advancing nigh, Bristling they rous'd and gave a hideous cry. His staff disclos'd he wav'd with awful nod, Jaw-lock'd they gaz'd upon the golden rod, Loud thunder shook the adamantine jail, The whole pack crouch'd and Rapine wagg'd his tail. A hollow voice broke from the cells below: “Stop, Mortal, Stop: Ah, whither would you go! These are the endless labyrinths of hell, Relentless vengeance reigns through every cell.” 'Tis not the voice of warning from a friend, 'Tis a damn'd Lawyer warns you of his end. Amidst eternal torments from his den, Preaching unwillingly, to long-rob'd men. Artful he was, invading, but not brave, A willing hireling, but a timid slave. Eagle-eyed Judgement, parts almost divine, Learning that flow'd from an exhaustless mine. Hero in Science, to its utmost stretch, Bacon that Hero was—and I that Wretch. I could besides quote many a serious case; Would you were here, to quote them in my place: After this warning that can never be; Farewel for ever—If you think of me. Follow Cocytus up the realms of night, The mournful waters fly the verge of light. The plaintive streams diminish all the way, Divide and languish at the sight of day. Lost amongst frightful rocks its source you'll see, Within the dolorous region of Ennui.— Terrible lesson this—Bacon indeed! Think of you, said the Chief!—Yes—I had need. The ways of Justice here pass our vain skill; God's Justice is his own unerring will. What's that to you? said Bacon; Idle prate! Your wills are crooked—but the laws are straight. He felt the stroke, and, like the stricken deer, Turn'd round, stole off, and dropp'd a painful tear. Silent he wound along the rueful coast, And heard the moans of many a wretched ghost, Wand'ring they walk'd, or fix'd in horror stood, Nail'd on the banks of that lamenting flood. Thousands he met, returning to their graves, Wash'd every night in those disastrous waves. Far to the right a peep of day appear'd, Leaving the rocks behind, to that he steer'd. A boundary stood there—a blasted tree, Hell goes no farther—and there ends Ennui. The Chief press'd on with unremitting speed, And now in day-light thought he saw the Tweed, Working its weary way through wide domains, Where merciless Ennui for ever reigns. Through sandy tracts and sherifdoms of fen, Border'd with peat-moss far as eye can ken, Where spiteful Boreas shews his utmost spite, And whistling gathers every poison'd blight. 'Twas not the Tweed, the semblance mock'd the Chief; Ideal witchcraft—seat of mental grief, Where every object has its proper pain, To tire the eye, to rack or mope the brain. Close by the shore he saw in bonnets blue Many a rebel chief that once he knew; Fain would have stopp'd them, but they all retir'd, Save one, whose penance was almost expir'd. He seem'd an antient Piper, by his geer, His port was stately, and his eye severe. A lyre, appendant to his bagpipe hung, And thus the Northern Orpheus said or sung: “Out of a roguish king, against all rule, I undertook to make a learned fool; And here I am, sent hither, as you see, For having made him—what he was—all Three. His royal inclinations were his own, And all his vice—for virtue he had none. I am Buchanan, this is my reward, Make no reply; but listen to your Bard. A while upon the beech I'll take my stand, Till I explain the wonders on each hand. We on the left enclos'd within those shoals Dwell in the country of perturbed souls. Hither transported for a certain space, The restless spirit finds no resting place. And here the jaded traveller resorts, Whose days are lost in brothels or in courts. The midnight gambler, when his race is run, That lives undoing, and that dies undone. Wild Mountaineers, who neither plow nor sow, Who wish no greater curse to their worst foe This is the character of all savages: the Abbé R?l speaking of the Canadians, says “Leur plus vive Imprécation contre un Ennemi Mortel, c'étoit qu'il fut réduit à labourer un Champ.” Histoire Politique et Philosophique, vol. VI. p. 14.. The lawless spoiler, and the licensed cheat, That eat the bread of outrage and deceit. Here we must stay till we have cleared our score, Our penance ended—we are wafted o'er; Mean while, insuperable waves divide The Paradise, where blessed fools reside. We see the Land of Pleasure with despair, And curse the stream that keeps us where we are, With anguish view the happiest of Isles, Where Plenty laughs, and every Season smiles, Like birds of passage with instinctive sail, There venial sinners fly with every gale; Even ambition, avarice, and pride, Provided Folly only was their guide. The fool who starv'd himself, and meant no ill, May starve in Paradise, or take his fill. Those who were fond of rank and royal show, Are shadowy Kings and empty Peers below. All Kings, all Statesmen, have some foolish leaven, The best come there before they are fit for heaven. None go directly to that holy place, But Ideots, Infant Babes, and Babes of Grace. Sins of complexion, fashion, and skin deep, Arrive per saltum, following like sheep. But mighty sinners come not with such ease, They must come far about, through dreadful seas; The vainest creatures the most harmless are, The poorest poet is the vainest far; God gives the croaking frog, like these vain things, Some satisfaction, whilst he thinks he sings. And there the Poet sings, the Lover wooes, And his warm turtle spreads her tail and cooes. Many a Debauchee you think in hell There meets a hearty welcome, and fares well: Tyrant of beings, worthier than himself, The Squire pursues, like a malicious elf, The ghosts of weeping stags and timorous hares, And for the souls of innocents lays snares: Just the same noisy fool he was above, That men despised, and only brutes could love.” Buchanan finish'd, pointing to a boat, Gave a few hints, and vanish'd quick as thought; Close to the shore a dogged boatman plied, Cover'd with Tartan rags in squalid pride; The Chieftain lifted up his hand in air, He knew old Lovat, and he knew his fare: Simon, invited by the Scotch bawbee, Push'd his boat through the mud, and took his fee. I knew you, said the boatman, at first sight; I see your travels have not chang'd you quite. You are a judge, now judge between us two, Which of us is the worthiest, I or you; You sent me here—I know it gave you pain, I transport you, as much against the grain. Troth, maister M?y, if I had the power, You should go back, and finish the grand tour. Or else, amuse yourself, if you thought good, Amongst your friends on this side of the flood. Taunting and gibing, Simon stemm'd the tide, And landed M?y on the envied side. With Talbot, Hardwicke, Pelham, in his train, And ancient Peers, without a single Thane. The Second George was walking on the key, And view'd the sullen marshes of Ennui. He saw the Clans distinctly with his glass, Like Mews and Sea Gulls, wailing on the Bass Bass, a famous Rock Island, near the mouth of the Forth.. Balmarino, said George, Cameron I know; I never hated any gallant foe: All would have scaped, had they been only mine; Would I could waft them o'er, and pay their fine. Whigs have been sometimes cheats, and often tools, Tories were always knaves, and Jacks but fools. Hardwicke replied, “Sir, Nothing is more true;” T?l?t rejoined, “If you'll except a few” “Supposing,” Stanhope said, “This can be done, In which of these exceptions is your son?” “My Lord,” said Talbot, “both of us were bit; I, as a humble patriot, you a wit: You could not make a genteel rogue of Phil; Nor I an honest Whig of graceless Will. I grant he kennels with a knavish pack, But hope and think my son is but a Jack. Yon rebels were not trapp'd in Folly's snare; 'Twas treachery and falsehood brought them there. No sooner set ashore than in a scrape, Placed in full view—no chance for an escape; Confused the Chief advanc'd—and all the while Kept up a constant fire of bow and smile. “Whoever thought to see that Gownman here? Tell him,” said George, “to drop into the rear.” “How brisk my uncle looks!” said Jack Jack Moslyn., “how young!” George gave a Pugh!—and Jack put out his tongue, The King had turn'd from that contrasted scene To sprightly meads and lawns for ever green: Wood-waving mountains, sunny sheep-clad hills, And valleys tinkling with perpetual rills. Not far from thence a terrace lifted high, With antique towers arrests the ravish'd eye: Proud Windsor rush'd into the Chieftan's mind, Thither they hied—and left the Chief behind. Despised by George, suspected by the best; Dreaded by some, and hated by the rest. Close by the Royal Dome the King stopp'd short, And said, “My Lords, you hear the late report— Lyttelton's come—If so—pray, heaven, he bring, Good news from honest England, and its King: Your brother's not yet come—Fame says he's dead; Pelham, what think you?—Pelham shook his head. “I fear,” he answer'd, after a short pause, “If there's bad news my brother was the cause. You, Royal Sir, are not without some blame, Knowing their hopes, and knowing whence they came. You, Sir, yourself, was once the rising sun, And saw what lengths ambitious courtiers run.” “Pelham,” replied the King, “I own 'tis true; All this, and more than this, Alas, I knew. I saw with pleasure, when I ceased to reign, My people soon would wish me back again.” The Monarch then, it was his usual hour, Slipp'd from them, hurrying to Valmoden's bower. M?y, though humbled, not without disdain Travers'd the lawns, and saunter'd down a lane; On each side, arbours, alleys, and alcoves, And dark recesses for the modest loves. A noble matron A late Dutchess, Kingston., double-gilt with grace, Attends, and does the honours of the place. The secrets of that walk no tongue must tell, There silence dwells; there only fit to dwell. Just at the turn he stopp'd to take a view, A building seem'd to offer something new; A mansarde roof, a contour light and trim, Like a Financier's toy or Marquis whim. Placed in a plain, in flowery mazes scrawl'd, The plain a sweeping curve with horn-beams wall'd, Sprinkled with figur'd plots, where statues stray, Where urns and vases rest and fountains play. The doors cry out, the windows all proclaim, Vive le Roy—from France the fancy came. The garden-gate, said he, cries out Encore; The lines above, perhaps, may tell us more Inscription light, and airy like the rest; Trick'd up in airy French, and thus express'd: Entrez, aimable fou, soiez content et gai, Ici, l'on est content, et plus fou qu'à Fernai: Nous chantons, nous buvons, faisons des vaudevilles, A nos cotés toujours tenons nos jolies filles: Notre joyeux concert, pour nous, est assez beau Nous n'envions aucun qui psalmodie en haut, Ni saint ni sainte vierge, équipage inutile; Ici point de pucelle; et point de difficile. Voulez vous attrister votre vin, mes amis? Allez à cet hotel, justement vis-à-vis, Des filles fuiez-vous l'impertinent ramage? Allez, apprenez là, que c'est que d'etre sage, Au Sçavoir vivre Anglois, et Scavez vous pour quoi? S'ennivrer tristemment, c'est Scavoir vivre là. M?y was not in cue for folks so gay, He slouched his hat, and stepp'd across the way. 'Twas still the mart of British wit and vice, Arthur's—but what is Arthur's without dice? A garden, with but one forbidden tree, Of black-leg Knowledge; all the rest were free. Thankless, indifferent to all the rest, Of all God's blessed fools they were least blest. He pass'd unnotic'd through the maudlin gloom, And in a corner snug studied the room. There made these sketches—leaning on his cane, Drawn on the Album of his fruitful brain. Northington there!—I envy his good luck, And C?s Y?k too!—Both of them drunk as muck. Here I am lost—I can't conceive a bit, What a weak instrument is human wit! Instead of contradicting and asserting, Bedford—grown narrative and less diverting; Poor matter—the same manner—smart and quick, B?d house anecdotes; and pranks of Dick Dick Rigby.. Is that a soul that's sleeping by the fire? Hah! honest Stee! would I could see your sire! What pensive wight is that tracing with wine, Like Archimedes, some sublime design? I know him well, and if I judge aright, Those lines are gibbets—his supreme delight: The table's full of them—alive or dead Hanging must always run in S?'s Selwin's. head. Wilkes, much the liveliest of all the club, The Wits—as flat as monumental Bub; Bub Bub Dodington, lord Melcombe. in the chair—no more like flesh and blood, Than the first Consul's Image, made of wood. Our Orators blow cold—temperate at most; No heated wind blows here from the gold coast. O North, where is thy sting? O Gibby, say— What are you both, but buttermilk and whey? Tax-ridden Porter, cheated of its malt, Or wambling, oatmeal porridge without salt. Waddling, with pinking eyes, and head-piece loose, St?y Hans Stanly. still gabbles, like a stubble goose. P?'s Pitt's. eloquence by all that I can find, Vanish'd, and has not left a wreck behind. The Chief, just at that instant, raised his head, And caught P?s eye, that almost look'd him dead. Struggling—at last he started from his seat, Awoke—and found C?n-wood a safe retreat— Safe in his bed, in a fine breathing steam, Refreshing, after such a feverish dream. MONKISH EPITAPHS. EPITAPH UPON ONE OF THE NOBLE FAMILY OF THE SCROPES. TRANSLATED. A Long farewell to Hope and Fear; A restless traveller rests here. Scrope's weary bones no more shall ake, His watchful eyes no longer wake. The head of all these plains, ah, why Should heads so spiritual die? (The matter in them is so small And light, 'tis next to none at all); Time, envious Time, shorten'd his reign, And ne'er will shew his like again. Religious moralist attend, Here, and here only, toil and grief Shall find sure comfort and relief, And every pain and terror end. EPITAPH UPON AN ABBOT. TRANSLATED. Here Martin keeps not to detain you, For here he cannot entertain you, A stricter fast than monks in high Lent; And, stranger still, here Martin's silent. Here he remains and will remain, Nor e'er consent to rise again, Though the last trumpet sounds the alarm, And angels offer him an arm, Or a kind Cherub spreads his wings That like a sky-lark mounts and sings, Unless, instead of heavenly dews And manna, only food for Jews, He finds pure wine, both dry and sweet, Palpable bread and solid meat. Freedom of speech without restriction, Danger, reproof, or contradiction. To shut one's mouth and hold one's tongue Who can submit to, old or young? 'Tis like a lock'd up candle's end, That frights no foe, and lights no friend. If that's the case here he will lie Rather than sit with mutes on high. No place like this so well can suit A moping chartreux, or a mute. EPITAPH UPON A RECTOR. TRANSLATED. He whom no house, no haunt could hold, Wand'ring like wolves from fold to fold, Who made each house each hill and dale, Both an asylum and a jail, Laid by the heels and caught at last, Is here confined in durance fast, By land for ever, on the hoof, By water, always water-proof. Jocky, groom, sailor, first of jokers, And legislator amongst smokers. Like Moses, wrapt in clouds of smoke, He laid down laws to hearts of oak; A sportsman keen by land and water, Yet never took delight in slaughter; A fisher, like the pope, of fish, Who never caught one single dish. Tender to game of every sort He shed no harmless blood in sport; No plaintive widow of the wood Mourn'd for her mate or infant-brood. Venatic saviour, most deserving, Not for destroying but preserving. Not more renown'd for song and pipe Than for a powerful fist and gripe. He set the spoiler in the stocks, And fell'd the poacher like an ox. Chief of the music of the steeple A poet amongst tuneful people, A scribe that never miss'd a mail, Whose letters flew as thick as hail, That like the Sybils leaves in air, He threw at random every where. All his pursuits were much the same, Much expectation, and no game: Like father Time for ever moving, Never improved, always improving. All mortals that are made of clay Proceed exactly on his way. As anxious children waiting stand, Then slily creep, with salt in hand, To catch hedge-sparrows, larks, or quails, If they can lay salt on their tails. Even so, our measures, schemes, and cares, Are oft as weak and vain as theirs. Amongst us all, alas, how few Have skill to catch what we pursue. Cetera desunt. EPITAPH UPON A DOCTOR. TRANSLATED. Here end the bleedings and the purgings Of the ghastliest of doctor surgeons. Vanpurge lies here, who, on living ground, So much the shadowy king resembled, Whene'er death met him in his round Death turn'd out of the road and trembled; Or seeing the glancing phantom pass He thought he saw himself in a glass. Both of them look'd as if their faces Were made of weather-beaten stone, With nought for noses but their bases, Nought for their cheeks and chin but bone. Instead of eyes, dark hollow sockets; Instead of mouths, a horrid grin; Their inside like a poet's pockets, Space circumscribed by a leather skin. Their trade, their instruments, the same; Alike in all things, but the name. Wonder not at the doctor's age, Nor that he outlived the long-lived Crow, Whom Death himself durst not engage, Lest Death himself he should overthrow. Death had seen many, in many a shape, Make their escape out of his jaws, But never once saw one escape On whom the doctor laid his paws. Proof against hunger, ptysick, stone, And even the pox's poison'd shafts; Nought could destroy this skeleton, But his own tools or his own draughts, Which to himself at last applied, Vanpurge, like all his patients, died. EPITAPH UPON A GENERAL. TRANSLATED. Here lies, for so the envious Fates decree, All that remains of general Charles Lee, General and chieftain, by the Grace of God, From Thames to Don, and Wolgian Novogrod. From Danube and the Euxine, to the Straits, And cross the Atlantic Ocean to Hell gates. A hardy tribune of the Yanky crew, The only head, not crack'd entirely through. Scourged by the Indians, buffeted, reviled, And then adopted for a heaven-born child. Silver Heel's son, by him named Boiling water, Then given in wedlock to his virgin daughter; Replete with redolent and poignant charms, A willing captive in a captive's arms, Loving and kind, as Antony's warm gypsey, With all her feeling true, sober or typsey. From their endearments and keen embraces Were born a pair of lovely copper faces. A princess, ushered by the prince her brother Twins, like each parent, more than like each other. Cæsar his mother's, hapless darling once, His father's awful image, cast in bronze, Till a vile British harlot, as fame goes, Destroy'd the likeness, with young Cæsar's nose. As a stern lion, dauntless from the wood, Lashing his angry tail in sullen mood, Surveys his trembling enemies at bay With foot, deep-rooted, in his breathless prey. Such was the general, in the embattled field, The lion's sovereign confidence his shield. The lion's horrid voice to old and young Impress'd less terror than his dreadful tongue, A tongue that flay'd without the least compunction. And left the bleeding caitiff without unction. That never lick'd nor healed the wound it gave, That never hurt the virtuous and brave. That, like the Russian knout, extorted groans From bowels, hearts, and hides, as hard as stones. Sharp as the Roman Lictor's ax and rod, Rigid as Jove's inexorable nod. He stripp'd the boaster of his borrow'd skin, And laughing shew'd the dastard ass within, Nor less to modest right, humane and true, He gave back injured worth, its plunder'd due. Him sword, nor plague, nor famine, could consume, Nor Venus, foaming in a plaguy fume; Nor all the accumulated rage and might Of coward treachery and female spight. Thus sung, exulting with prophetic mirth, A Cambrian Bard, inspired at Charles's birth: Intrepid Boy, go wander the world over, Through paths untrod by any antient rover; Despise the tyrant wrath of vengeful kings, The vulgar's worthless praise and Envy's stings. Like Hercules, immortal, toil through life, Trust your own strength with all things but a wife. Tame all, except one monster of your spouse's, Of aspect mild as any cat that mouses; Like modest Tabby, sporting with her prey, Before she draws the vital blood away. A horrid monster that avoids the light, And, silent as the grave, preys the whole night. Given first to Omphale when Juno taught her, To quell and make Alcides weak as water. From her derived the fatal present came, To many a jealous wife and virtuous dame. Dragging his tail, subdued by magic sops, Cerberus fawn'd, and dropp'd his greedy chops. No sop, no chain, no lock that you can put on, Can ever tame the ravenous dumb glutton. EPITAPH UPON A LIVING SUBJECT. TRANSLATED. Here lies the body of John H?, Entomb'd within this castle-wall; Impaired by time not overthrown, Fairly subdued by Sloth alone. Like one of Virgil's lazy cattle, Unfit alike for peace or battle. As snug and totally at rest As dormice in their dormant nest. Like souls unborn and unequipp'd, A blank, of many a passion stripp'd. That minds as much as these same weak ones The threats of bishops, priests, and deacons. And who the promises believes Of priests and deacons and lawn sleeves, As much as they themselves believe All that they teach from morn to eve. Which they are not to blame for teaching, But those that pay them for their preaching. When young, by his parish priest's assistance, He saw great marvels at a distance; He saw both heaven and hell below, And also saw in heaven or hell, But so far off they made no show, All people that on earth do dwell, As children lifted by the chin See London town and all within. But now shut up and left alone, Like a poor toad under a stone, Entrenched up to the teeth and nose, He sees no more of these fine shows. Flattering hope and soft belief, And fear a trembling midnight thief, From hence, long since are fled and gone, And love no longer dwells with John. Like tempests on a desart shore Unheard the senates thunders roar; Nor the king's speech, nor king together, Delight him, he's in such bad luck, More than the bell of a bell-wether, Or a young calf that wants to suck. Nor all his peeresses and peers, And Lady Marys fresh or stale, No more than wanton mares or steers, And heifers prurient for a male. Not even the queen, whom all admire, Can strike one spark of genial fire. Something from nothing cannot flow, As every smatterer must know: Where there's no subject, there's no story; No care into his breast can steal, Neither the love of fame and glory, Nor such as gentle shepherds feel. Like Daphne, slumbering in some bower, Seized and kept under as she lies, Weighed down by a resistless power, That will not suffer her to rise; The helpless and abandon'd virgin Feels all hopes over of emerging. In such a hopeless forlorn plight Passive he lies, depress'd at length, With all the dead incumbent weight, And energy of inert strength. Dead to the world, himself, and friend, And dead in fact world without end, Unless at last the god of gold, Storming his castle and strong hold, Where he in torpid peace within is, Rouse him with showers and peals of guineas. A ROYAL EPITAPH. TRANSLATED. The champion of scholastic heroes, Solomon James, foully bewrayed, Whose mother was as chaste as Nero's, And fiddling was his father's trade, Lies here, and with him lie his tools, His king-craft, and his conjuror's staff; His logic, chopp'd small, for the schools, Was blown away before like chaff. Happy the youths kept far from court, To virtue trained, by parents fond; Blest the old women that could sport, And swim like otters in a pond. For all young men that came near him Were spoiled, within that magic ground, And all old maids that could not swim Must swim; or else, like cats, be drowned. May he now meet his just reward, May he each night come from the shades, And toil all night and labour hard, An incubus upon old maids. And when the witches saboth comes, May he attend the witches call, Mumbling their spells with toothless gums, And be the ram King James, in his Dæmonology, says, that a devil, in the shape of a black ram, performs this office for the witches at their grand assemblies, which he describes with all the minuteness of an eyewitness. that rides them all. EPITAPH FOR HIS GRANDSON, CHARLES II. Immortal Henry Henry Fourth, king of France., Great and Good, The only King by right divine; One drop of James's wizard blood Spoiled every generous drop of thine! Here lies thy grandson's wicked bones, Never to be restored again; His brother rests with fainted drones, And ends, thank heaven, the Stewarts reign. IMITATED. A MONASTIC ELEGY. Now silence in the woodlands reigns, Whilst the pale Goddess of the night, Shoots o'er the waters and the plains A trembling and delusive light. Illumin'd by her magic beams, That steeple rears its solemn head, The shadowed turf a mantle seems, Spread o'er the mansions of the dead. Singing her mortuary dirge, There sits the owl till break of day, Responsive, through the cloister'd verge, Winds howl and drive the bat away. There musing Fancy takes her stand, The child of Genius and of Spleen, And waves her visionary wand, To realize her pictur'd scene. She calls Gray's spirit from the tomb, To take his mournful midnight round, And sees him gliding through the gloom, Within these favourite precincts bound. Pursuing with her brain-mock'd eye The circling gleam that marks his way, And hears his lengthen'd parting sigh, Returning to his bed of clay. With many a love-lost maid and swain There lies the cemetery bard, There shall the Muse of sorrow reign Till corn shall grow in Paul's Church-yard. An old Receipt for a troublesome Disorder. Let jealous blockheads agonize and fret, Waste all their wealth, their study, time, and skill, O'er wavering virtue watchful senteries set, To keep their spouses chaste against their will. In lofty domes enclosed and painted bowers, With costly worship though their idols shine, Cover'd with Orient gems in glittering showers, They pine and sicken in their gilded shrine. Or led in triumph through a gazing crowd, Like Ægypt's goddess, Isis, Heifer, Queen, That nods her golden horns in semblance proud, But longs to sport and couch upon the green. Make not your mate an object for parade, A picture placed for artist eyes to view, Or fancy-figure of a masquerade, That pleases only whilst the fancy's new. The fruits of commerce, the rewards of war, Your riches rescued from the treacherous main, The painful harvest of the sordid bar, Let her preserve without your farther pain. Let household cares employ her hands and head, At table treat her like a vestal pure, Make her the wife and mistress of your bed. Believe her faithful, and you'll find her sure. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, UPON HEARING THAT HE WAS CANVASSING AGAINST THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION. Nov. 11, 1778. Respue quod non es: tollat sua munera cerdo, Tecum habita, et noris quam sit tibi curta supellex. Persius, Sat. IV. v. 51. 'Tis easier to know, by far What we are not, than what we are. A man may feel without much pain, And own he has no athletic brain; But still will never know the fact, If it be ricketty or crackt. Miss may perceive, though no one taught her, Her eyes are not of the first water; No brilliants, but the true goose-eye Miss in her glass will never spy; For in her round white eyes the girl Sees the mild lustre of the pearl. That I am no great wit or poet I know: the criticks do not know it. But what I am, in spite of pride, I know no more than my backside. All know the strongest man and meekest. And I can tell who is the weakest: “The man that pays five thousand pound “Unforced, and without any grumbling, “For leave to sit in Rotten Ground “Within a Rotten House that's tumbling: “With further leave upon occasion, “Either upon his legs or seat, “To shew the sages of the nation “The model of a fool, complete, “In style, voice, figure, look, and action, “Even to Garrick's satisfaction.” This cap, whose bells to Midas ears, Sound like the music of the spheres, Can by no means your head-piece fit, You only paid for leave to sit; Now from your passion, I'm appealing To your good sense and sober feeling. You know you are not Burke nor Barré, Ready to fly at any quarry; You neither want the means nor skill, But you don't know you want the will. Without an unremitting force Man has but half a will of course, And none, excepting womankind, Get what they want with half a mind. By some repulsive power within You are check'd the moment you begin; Like a spring fix'd to shut a door, That drives it back for evermore. To fly at magpies, jays, and crows, Is not the thing that you propose; What you propose, you have tried before; And, if you're wise, you'll try no more. What must be done, then? faith, dear honey, Do any thing—but waste your money. I ne'er learnt aught from men of letters, Nor school-men, school-boys are their betters: The wise ones spend it not in trash, But whip their gigs and keep their cash. Play then, no matter with what toy, Play within bounds, like a good boy. AN EPISTLE FROM JOHN ME, ESQUIRE, TO His Excellence My Lord SELF. —E cœlo descendit ????? ???????. Juv. Sat. II. v. 27. Quid tibi vis? calido sub pectore mascula bilis Intumuit, quam non extinxerit urna cicutæ. Persius, Sat. V. v. 145 My Lord, Whether from courtesy or grace, Custom or patent from the King, Your Lordship's preseance and place To me is an establish'd thing. Whatever titles kings devise, I always take for current pay, Whether their royal heads are wise, Or only made of common clay: And as to custom, seldom mind, Whether it serves for any use, We may be thankful when we find A custom is not an abuse. From the same sire and dam we draw Our form and likeness to each other. If I am wiser, common law Assigns it to the younger brother: You have more money, I more mettle, I will not be like you, my Lord, As we have an account to settle, I'll pay my debts before I hoard. I would not pay you what I owe you, If I could cheat you without shame, And yet I love you, though I know you; Where is the man can say the same? Old Flaccus took himself to task, And old Montaigne himself unravels, They'll shew you how, you need but ask, They are both at hand, in all your travels. I do not mean, that you and they Are like the three of whom we read; “Voila trois tetes dans un bonnet:” Which is a Riddle, not a Creed. If one improve at any rate, Be it by sapience or dreaming, Though it may seem to come too late, I hold it not at all unseeming. Were they, by their fine curtain-lectures, In fact improv'd? that I'll not swear, The fact rests wholly on conjectures, If you will take their words they were. Come, then, I'll open you my budget, It is not like Pandora's box, Nor North's; replete, as patriots judge it, With the Scotch itch, and the French pox. 'Tis much more like an old wife's potion Of Sir John Pringle's, or a charm; Or any other anile motion, That may do good and does no harm. You have committed many a folly, And told me to my face I did it; Rather than see you melancholly Perhaps I did not quite forbid it; But there are follies I could name, Some of them past all understanding. Freaks which I utterly disclaim; Pranks, none of which I had no hand in. I drop this point, I am no stranger To your repentance, and know why In many points you are out of danger Of going now so much awry. Who made your Lordship sour and proud? Not I; you must give me my due: I was, and always was allow'd, Quite the reverse, till spoil'd by you. 'Twas you, not me, that was suspicious, Of those that never meant you ill, When you said any thing malitious 'Twas you that spoke against my will, When you were bouncing like a squib, I whisper'd you, and bid you shun it: Instead of teaching you to fib I made you blush, when you had done it. You made folks laugh that else would sleep; Truly a very fine defence; They would not let me off so cheap, You made them laugh at my expence. My Lord, I speak it to your glory, When arguments could not prevail, I have prevailed, by a short story; Therefore I'll tell you a short tale: “A lord, like many of the land, “There was, that scorn'd to balk his passions: “He gave the ton, I understand, “To all the Macaroni fashions: “This Lord was over head and ears “In love, you'll find in modern histories— “Love with himself; for it appears, “Like you, he had no other mistress. “He let the Arena stroke and pat him; “She laugh'd, with prudence, in her sleeve, “At table, whether she laugh'd at him “Or with him, how should he perceive? “His love, she knew, was fix'd and true: “She did not laugh at him for this; “She laugh'd at him, because she knew “He had no business with a miss.” Where none could suffer but ourselves, You were my pilot night and day; Driven, by the rapids, amongst shelves And quicksands, we were cast away. As to the faults of constitution, I took with you my natural share, They might be help'd with resolution, But that was more than we could bear. Expos'd to many a sooty flatus, That blows out of the devil's bellows, Vapours to flatten or elate us, We must be always foolish fellows, Who was it put you upon rhyming? I did; to find you an employment I pull'd the string, and left you chiming, I wound you up for your enjoyment. For the same purpose, or a better, I made you pore in books and poke, Till you could hardly see a letter, Till it was almost past a joke. What would become of you, do you think, Was I to leave you quite and clean, To take away your pen and ink, And leave you nothing but your spleen? Forgetting all you have read or wrote, Some fair enchantress of the town, The rustling of a petticoat, Might turn your wisdom upside down. Strange passions in an evil hour Come unawares; and what's more sad, Even when men have lost all power, But that of running silly mad. Without assistance from above, Or such a faithful friend as me, Who knows but you may fall in love Like Dashwood, when you are sixty-three. The Caput Mortuum, we descry, Of vice, in Harrington's inanity, But in a doatard's love-sick eye, The Caput Mortuum of insanity. 1778, November 25. A MONSIEUR LE GENERAL HALE. TRANSLATION, FOR THE TEA-TABLE. To-day our Cleveland squires dine here, You can't conceive how you'll admire us, If you will come, and in your rear, Bring up your ladies to unsquire us? When an adept will undertake him She can unsquire her man with ease; She makes the squire at once forsake him When once she makes him wish to please. On earth whatever is delightful, Grateful or pleasant above measure, Without a female soon grows frightful, Or gives one greater pain than pleasure. Without a General, you know, And every creature understands, What is an army but a show, Like the militia, and train-bands? Would not our horse, and foot, and guards, Be good for nought but a review? Or to sit down and play at cards, Or gallop with the King to Kew? Without the ladies all our feasts, As I'm a sinner amongst sinners, Are only ord'naries for beasts, Like fox-hunters or horse-race dinners. The Pope, throughout his papal-life, No other Prince, the Pope alone, Has neither general nor wife, I mean, no lady of his own. Exempt from war, free from desire, In peace profound he spends his days, The dew of heaven quenches his fire, The grace of God keeps him from frays. A favour that's bestowed so rarely, And not the privilege of birth, Proves all their holinesses fairly To be God's vicars upon earth, Folks without grace lead no such lives, And without grace, 'tis no great wonder: We must have generals and wives, And mistresses to keep us under, Oct. 15, 1775. PANTY'S SWEETHEART. As stiff as a stake, with a light wanton air, Consumptive and hectick, and worse for the wear: No tooth in her head, like a hen in the moot, From her rump to her toppin as bare as a coot: If her lips are like rubies and warm as a toast, Her face is as thin and as pale as a ghost: Eat up with the vapours; as dry as a stick; And her breath is enough to make a dog sick: In spite of her vapours and pestilent breath, That would soon put a poor mackarony to death, Her Panty, quite lost in a sea of delight, Enraptur'd, can feast on her lips the whole night; Can cheer, with warm kisses, the gloomiest day, And find in November the sweetness of May. Yet so frail is his love, when ardently press'd, 'Tis so easy to kindle a flame in her breast: Though her sovereign to-night, he knows to his sorrow, His footman, perhaps, may succeed him to-morrow. If, after all this, you are hard of belief, And would fain know her name—turn over the leaf.</field>

Life is a Farce, mere Children's Play, Go learn to model thine by theirs, Go learn to trifle Life away, Or learn to bear a Life of Cares. J'abandonne l'exactitude Aux gens qui riment par métier; D'autres font des vers par étude, J'en fais pour me desennuïer. Gresset. First printed in the year 1765. THE AUTHOR'S APOLOGY TO HIMSELF Free from all pernicious vice, Yet not so scrupulously good, To want a comfortable spice To warm a sober Christian's blood. The sin of Harlotry and Keeping, Is that which I can least excuse, That of cohabiting and sleeping, With an abandon'd common Muse. More like a Muse's poor toad-eater; A trollop with a flippant air, Without one amiable feature, Or any graces to her share. You tell me, if I needs must print, You'll not oppose my foolish will, And bid me take a sober hint From sober folks at Strawberry-hill. Stand forth like them, produce yourself, Be elegantly bound and letter'd, Be wise, like them, nor quit your shelf, But there remain, for ever fetter'd. I do not print to get a name; As Trublet says, I am none of those; I only print, because my aim Is happiness, whilst I compose: Composing gives us no delight, Unless we mean to publish what we write. Scribbling, like Praying, 's an employment, In which you think yourself a bubble, Without some prospect of enjoyment, And satisfaction for your trouble; And though your hopes at last prove vain, If you have been amus'd, 'twas so much gain. If you still teaze me, and persist That publishing shews a vain heart, The Songsters upon Dodsley's list Shall be call'd in to take my part. And as they strip a lad quite bare, After they've coax'd him from his play, Then lay him down, and cut and pare All his impediments away: And as the lad without his leave Is made an excellent Musician, By a manœuvre I conceive As nice as Tristram's Circumcision: So, though you only just can scrape Among the Fiddlers of the Nine, They'll make you drunker than an ape, And make you think you fiddle fine. PROLOGUE TO THE CRAZY TALES. Quod petis hic est, Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit æquus. There is a Castle in the North, Seated upon a swampy clay, At present but of little worth; In former times it had its day. This ancient Castle is call'd Crazy, Whose mould'ring walls a moat environs, Which moat goes heavily and lazy, Like a poor prisoner in irons. Many a time I've stood and thought, Seeing the boat upon this ditch, It look'd as if it had been brought For the amusement of a Witch, To sail amongst applauding frogs, With water-rats, dead cats and dogs. The boat so leaky is and old, That if you're fanciful and merry, You may conceive without being told, That it resembles Charon's wherry. A turret also you may note, Its glory vanish'd like a dream, Transform'd into a pigeon-cote, Nodding beside the sleepy stream. From whence, by steps with moss o'ergrown, You mount upon a terrace high, Where stands that heavy pile of stone, Irregular and all awry. If many a buttress did not reach A kind, and salutary hand, Did not encourage, and beseech, The terrace and the house to stand, Left to themselves and at a loss, They'd tumble down into the foss. Over the Castle hangs a tower, Threat'ning destruction every hour, Where Owls, and Bats, and the Jackdaw, Their Vespers and their Sabbath keep, All night scream horribly, and caw, And snore all day, in horrid sleep. Oft at the quarrels and the noise Of scolding maids or idle boys; Myriads of rooks rise up and fly, Like legions of damn'd souls, As black as coals, That foul and darken all the sky. With wood the Castle is surrounded, Except an opening to a Peak, Where the beholder stands confounded, At such a scene of mountains bleak; Where nothing goes, Except some solitary pewit, And carrion crows, That seem sincerely to rue it, That look as if they had been banish'd, And had been sentenc'd to be famish'd. Where nothing grows, So keen it blows, Save here and there a graceless fir, From Scotland, with its kindred fled, That moves its arms, and makes a stir, And tosses its fantastick head, That seems to make a noise and cry, Only for want of company. So a Scotch Minister in pulpit Is wrought by his gesticulation, 'Till he is taken with a dull fit, Peculiar to that vocation. He cries, and throws about his snivel, Their hearts are harder than the flint, They let him weep alone, and drivel, For not a soul will take the hint. In this retreat, whilom so sweet, Once Tristram and his Cousin dwelt, They talk of Crazy when they meet, As if their tender hearts would melt. Confounded in Time's common urn, With Harlots, Ministers, and Kings, O could such scenes again return! Like those insipid common things! Many a grievous, heavy heart, To Crazy Castle would repair, That grew, from dragging like a cart, Elastic and as light as air, Some fell to fiddling, some to fluting, Some to shooting, some to fishing, Others to pishing and disputing, Or to computing by vain wishing. And in the evening when they met, To think on't always does me good, There never met a jollier set, Either before, or since the Flood. As long as Crazy Castle lasts, Their Tales will never be forgot, And Crazy may stand many blasts, And better castles go to pot. Antony, Lord of Crazy Castle, Neither a fisher, nor a shooter, No man's, but any woman's vassal, If he could find a way to suit her, Collected all their Tales into a book, Which you may see if you go there to look. ANTONY'S TALE: OR THE BOARDING-SCHOOL TALE. TALE I. Lucy was not like other lasses, From twelve her breasts swell'd in a trice, First they were like two cupping-glasses, Then like two peaches made of ice; With swimming eyes and golden locks, Golden embroidery and fringe, Like an ivory or Dresden box, Mounted with golden lips and hinge: Or like the glory round the head, Of virgin Saints weeping and pale, When they are sacrific'd, and led To martyrdom, or to a male: Or as a comet's golden tail is; Or like the undulating light Of the aurora borealis, In a serene autumnal night. It is a shame, says her Mamma, To see a child with bib and apron, At bare thirteen, an age so raw, Grown and furnish'd like a matron. But if it was a Burning Shame, Lucy was not at all to blame, But they, who in her composition, Infus'd that warmth which was the cause Of such exuberant nutrition, The work of vegetative laws. It was just at the age I mention'd, Upon a very slight offence, Miss Lucy was condemn'd and pension'd, Both against equity and sense, Within a Boarding-school's detested walls, Doom'd to feel all its rigours, all its thralls! To endure the hunger and the chidings! To feel the longings and the watchings! To dread the stealings and the hidings! To bear the quarrels and the scratchings! And then such billings, and such cooings! Such Miss-demeanours and excuses! Such Miss-takes, and such Miss-doings! And such Miss-fortunes and abuses! There was a Captain of the Guards, A famous Knight of Arthur's table, Expert in women, vers'd in cards, A brother of the Turf and Stable. He had such a command of features, And was so droll and full of sport, He could take off all the queer creatures, And oddities of Arthur's Court; Set Arthur's Worthies in a row, So very comical a Knight, You could not single out and shew, Nor one that gave so much delight. One day whilst our Knight was busy, Extremely busy with her mother, Lucy had run till she was dizzy, About the garden with her brother. The captain's bus'ness being done, He saunter'd up and down the garden, As if he had neither lost nor won, As if he did not care a farthing. Yet his attention was profound, Observing Lucy grown so tall; Contemplating her breasts as round, And springy as a tennis-ball. The sight, indeed, was quite bewitching, I think I see him whilst I'm scribbling, Mouth watering, and fingers itching, To be both fingering and nibbling. To gratify the two young chicks, He roll'd his eyes, and acted Punch; Playing a thousand monkey-tricks, Making his back a perfect bunch With many a filthy slobbering kiss, Courting in Punch's squeaking tone, And wriggling and embracing Miss, As Punch embraces his wife Joan. And how to imitate a breast, The Captain said that Miss had plac'd, Swelling on each side of her chest, Two little dumplins made of paste; At which Punch gap'd, and swore an oath, That he would take and eat them both. On Lucy's neck the hungry spark Hung fix'd, like an envenom'd snake, Leaving a deep-indented mark, Which her Mamma could not mistake; For which irregular proceeding, Lucy was sent to study breeding. Lucy was angry with good cause, For she had seen, in Summer days, Necks very like her own Mamma's, Without a handkerchief or stays; It might be fuller and more nourish'd, And yet a neck not more inviting, Lucy had seen it scrawl'd and flourish'd Both with marks, and with hand-writing. Lucy was under no mistake, For it was not so long ago; Lucy was curious and awake, And old enough, she thought, to know. Would it not make one almost wild, If it was not so very common, To see one punish'd like a child, Only for acting like a woman? To see the moment after, may be, Her mother acting like a baby? Sent to a Governess of spirit, Lucy was watch'd from head to foot, Just like a rabbit with a ferret, For ever at the rabbit's scut. All the whole day in durance kept, At night the Governess with Lucy slept. But Lucy neither slept nor slumber'd, She toss'd and tumbled all the night; Her spirits were so much encumber'd, And flurry'd by the Captain's bite. Whether their poison they impart, By teeth, or nails, or by a sting, There is a virtue in some part, Of every poisonous thing. Though the experiment should fright her, Enough to throw her in a fit, Lucy must apply the biter Unto the poison'd part that's bit. Granted; but how could she contrive To bring so hard a point to bear? 'Twould puzzle any wit alive, That had not a great deal to spare. There's a remark, 'twas made long since, Machiavel made it for his Prince; “A Prince, says he, completely cruel, “Throughout inexorably bad, “Is an inestimable jewel, “Seldom or never to be had.” Though cruel often, and hard-hearted, Lucy's Mamma could not withstand, She gave her blessing when they parted, And slipp'd a guinea into Lucy's hand. With one poor guinea Lucy bought All that the Wise, the Rich, and Great, So frequently in vain have sought, Both in the world and their retreat. No potentate could ever buy it, Nor any child of Power and Wealth, Tranquillity or mental Quiet, With Liberty, Content, and Health. Lucy conducted her affairs So circumspectly, and so snug, By bribes she gain'd a friend down stairs, And made a purchase of a drug, Which drug is, in the vulgar tongue, Commonly call'd, The Devil's Dung. Within the lining of her gown, In two small bags under each arm, She beat and sow'd it nicely down, As if she had sown down a charm. The exhalation was so strong From every part of Lucy's cloaths, The Misses, as she pass'd along, Brush'd away, and held their nose. By far the greatest part presum'd, That it was owing to her hair; Others presum'd she was perfum'd, From being rotten as a pear. The scent so violent was grown, Her governess was forc'd to yield, The room, the maid, were all her own, Arms, tents, and baggage, and the field. ODE TO VENUS. O VENUS, awful Sovereign of the Spring Could I like thy Lucretius sing, Here would I pause, thy wonders to relate! Here would I pause to hymn thy praise, In adamantine words, stronger than Fate, And everlasting as his lays! O'er seas and deserts, undismay'd, Strengthen'd by thy inspiring breath, The timorous and bashful maid, Faces both infamy and death. Driven by thy divinity, Confounding equity and truth, Order and consanguinity, And loathsome age and blooming youth. Behold the frantick passion how it burns, Like a wild beast breaks every tie, Laughs at the Priest; the Legislator spurns, And gives both heaven and earth the lye! Let youth and insolence alone, Provoke thy vengeance every hour, But O! spare those that know, that own, Adore, and tremble at thy pow'r. With thy propitious Doves descend, And hear the tender Virgin's sighs, The humble and the meek defend, And bid the prostrate suppliant rise. By Venus Lucy was protected, Nothing was hurry'd, or neglected, The Misses, though she was quite well, Toss'd up their noses, full of airs, Though Lucy now had no one smell, That was not pleasanter than theirs. For a whole Winter, every night (Which made the wench grow monstrous thin) 'Till the war call'd him out to fight, Had Susan let the Captain in. Scarce had he left his native coast, 'Till Lucy, summon'd home, became A celebrated London toast, And the first favourite of Fame. Lucy was follow'd by a Peer, But all his arts could not trepan her; After a siege of a whole year, My Lord was forc'd to change his manner; So, like a wise and virtuous girl, Lucy, at last, was marry'd to an Earl. MY COUSIN'S TALE OF A COCK AND A BULL. TALE II. At Cambridge, many years ago, In Jesus, was a Walnut-tree; The only thing it had to shew, The only thing folks went to see. Being of such a size and mass, And growing in so wise a College, I wonder how it came to pass, It was not call'd the Tree of Knowledge. Indeed, if you attempt to run (The air so heavy is, and muddy) Any great length beyond a pun, You'll be obliged to sweat and study. This is the reason 'tis so good for tisics, And will account, why no one soph, No Fellow, ever could hit off, To call this Tree the Tree of Metaphysics: Though in the midst of the quadrangle, They every one were taught their trade; They every one were taught to wrangle, Beneath its scientific shade. It overshadow'd every room, And consequently, more or less, Forc'd every brain, in such a gloom, To grope its way, and go by guess. For ever going round about, For that which lies before your nose; And when you come to find it out, It is not like what you suppose. So have I often seen in fogs, A may-pole taken for a steeple; Christians oft mistook for hogs, Horses ta'en for Christian people. This stroke upon my tender brain Remains, I doubt, impress'd for ever; For to this day, when with much pain, I try to think strait on, and clever, I fidle out again, and strike Into the beautiful oblique. Therefore, I have no one notion, That is not form'd, like the designing Of the peristaltic motion; Vermicular; twisting and twining; Going to work Just like a bottle-skrew upon a cork. This obliquity of thinking I cur'd, formerly, by Logic, And a habitude of drinking Infusions pædagogic. The cure is worse than the disease, 'Tis just like drinking so much gall; So I keep thinking at my ease; That is, I never think at all. Thus a presuming Miss designs, Quite overwhelm'd with foolish pride, She drops her paper with black lines, And trusts herself without a guide. No longer kept within due bounds, For any thing that you can say, Her letters, like unruly hounds, Running all a different way; No longer writes as heretofore, But writes awry both now and evermore. But, a-propos, of bottle-skrews, You've seen a Parson at a table, Whose business was to read the news, And draw a cork, if he was able. And do remember, I dare say, The foolish figure that he makes, When the cork will not come away, For all the pains the Parson takes. By bit and bit he makes it come, Till he is forc'd against his will, To push it forward with his thumb; He has conducted it so ill: The reason is, his skrew is blunt, And will not do as it was wont. Thus with my head have I been here, Screwing to get at what I wanted: That you might have a Tale as clear And bright as if it was decanted. But as your time and patience are so short, I'll try to get at it in any sort IN Italy there is a town, Anciently of great renown; Call'd, by the Volscians, Privernum; A fortress against the Romans, Maintain'd, because it did concern 'em, Spite of Rome, and all her omens; But to their cost, At the long run their town was lost. Whether 'twas forc'd or did surrender, You never need, my dear Sir, know, Provided you will but remember, Privernum signifies Piperno. Close by the Franciscan Friars, There liv'd a Saint, as all declare, All the world cannot be lyars, Which Saint wrought miracles by prayer. Her life so holy was, and pure, Her prayers at all times, they believe, Could heirs or heiresses secure, And make the barren womb conceive. Which was a very safe expedient, And also wonderful convenient: For there was not a barren womb, That might not try, Going between Naples and Rome, As she pass'd by. My story will not be the worse, If you will but reflect with patience Upon the constant intercourse Between these famous neighbour nations. It is so great, that I dare say, The Saint could have but little ease; She must have been both night and day, Continually on her knees. For I can prove it very clear, That many of those wombs are barren; Which wombs, were they transplanted here, Would breed like rabbits in a warren. Near Terracina, once called Anxur, There is a place call'd Bosco Folto, A castle standing on a bank, Sir, The seat of the Marchese Stolto. In history you all have read, Most of you have, I'm pretty sure, How on that road there is no bed, Nor any inn, you can endure. For Stolto I had got a letter, From my good friend, Prince Mala-Fede, And from the Princess a much better, Wrote to his Excellency's Lady. The Marquis is advanc'd in years, And dries you so, there's no escaping; The merriest, when he appears, Yawn, and set the rest a gaping Seccare is a word of fun; It means to dry, as you may find, Not like the fire, or like the sun, But like a cold unpleasant wind. But she is perfectly well bred; Neither too forward, nor too shy: I never did, in any head, In all my life, see such an eye; Nor such a head on any shoulders; Nor such a neck, with such a swell That could present itself so well, To all the critical beholders. Four years the Marquis was hum-drumming, In that same place, with his bed-fellow, Waiting for the happy coming Of a young Marquis, a Stoltello. As soon as ever he arrives, The family is to be sent to The Cardinal at Benevento, For the remainder of their lives. The Cardinal is Stolto's nephew, His age is only twenty-seven; And of that age, alas how few! Who think, like him, of nought but Heaven. His aunt will manage and take care Of all the Cardinal's affairs, Stoltello is to be his heir, When he has finish'd all his prayers. Stolto may live as he thinks good, His life delightfully will run, Between his castle in the wood, His wife, his nephew, and his son. And yet, according to Fame's trumpet (Who very seldom trumpets right) His wife was reckon'd a great strumpet, His nephew a great hypocrite. I don't believe a word of that, The world will talk, and let it chat: You cannot think her in the wrong, To grow quite weary of the place; She thought Stoltello staid so long, He was asham'd to shew his face. Stolto had heard the Holy Maid Always cry'd up both far and near; And he believ'd she could persuade His son Stoltello to appear. Considering what time was past, How they had try'd, and better try'd, Stolto advis'd his wife at last, To go and be fecundify'd. The Marquis told me the whole story, Which he had from the Marchefina; And it is so much to her glory, 'Tis all the talk of Terracina. The very night that she came back, He was in such a sifting cue; He almost put her to the rack, Till she discover'd all she knew. First his acknowledgment being paid, A pepper-cornish kind of due; As they were laid, compos'd and staid, She told him just as I tell you: Before the Marchioness sets out, It will be proper, on reflection, To obviate a certain doubt, A doubt that looks like an objection. Here, because they know no better, The snarlers think they've found a bone; They think the Marquis would not let her Go such an errand all alone. A Lady, you must understand, That visits, to fulfil her vows, A holy house, or holy land, Commonly goes without her spouse, And so, by keeping herself still, Quiet and sober in her bed, She never thinks of any ill, Nothing unclean enters her head. You're satisfy'd your doubt was weak, And now the Marchioness may speak. As you foretold, before I went, The Saint was so engag'd, and watch'd, That a whole week and more was spent, Before my bus'ness was dispatch'd. Indeed, you would have greatly pity'd, If you had seen me but, my Dear; Howe'er, at last, I was admitted, And what I met with you shall hear. The Saint and I sat on a bench; Before us, on a couch, there lay A pretty little naked wench, That minded nothing but her play. Her play was playing with a mouse, That popp'd his head in, went and came, And nestled in its little house, It was so docible and tame. Guess where the mouse had found a bower. You are so dull, it is a shame; You cannot guess in half an hour, I'll lay your hand upon the same. These, cry'd the Saint, are all ideal, Visions all, and nothing real, Yet they will animate your blood, And rouze and warm the pregnant powers, Just like the ling'ring sickly bud, Open'd by fructifying showers. If you are violently heated, Remember in your greatest needs, Your Ave Mary be repeated, Till you have gone through all your beads: Take heed, they're going to begin, I see the visions coming in. First came a Cock, and then a Bull, And then a Heifer and a Hen: Till they had got their bellies full, On and off, and on again. And then I spy'd a foolish Filly, That was reduc'd to a strange pass, Languishing, and looking silly, At the proposals of an Ass. I turn'd about and saw a sight, Which was a sight I could not bear, A filthy Horse, with all his might, Gallanting with a filthy Mare. And lo! there came a dozen Priests! And all the Priests shaven and shorn! And they were like a dozen beasts, Naked as ever they were born: And they pass'd on, One by one, Every one with an exalted horn. Then they drew up and stood a while, In rank and file, And after, march'd off the parade, One by one, Falling upon The miserable, naked Maid. Nothing could equal my surprize, To see her go through great and small! And after that, to see her rise, And turn the joke upon them all! And I kept praying still and counting, In a prodigious fret and heat, And she successively kept mounting, And always kept a steady seat. Till having finish'd her career, The Priests were terribly perplex'd, They could not tell which way to steer, Nor whereabout to settle next. Brother was running after brother, Turning their horns against each other; The Holy Maid cry'd out aloud, Heaven deliver us from sin: And I turn'd up my eyes and bow'd, And said Amen within: The instant that I spoke, The visions vanish'd into smoke. Now, said the Marchioness, and smil'd, Now I'll toss up with you for a child. Already at your post indeed! Bravo—Bravissimo—proceed.— I find, my dear, you are so stout, So firmly fix'd to make a boy, I feel—I feel—you'll make it out! 'Tis done, said she—I wish you joy. Accordingly the Marquis swore, That very night he did a feat, Which he had seldom done before, That night he ran a second heat. And from that night computing fair, She had conceiv'd, About five months when I was there, As both the Marchioness and he believ'd. For four months after I repass'd, Calling again, to avoid those inns, And found her, brought to bed at last, Of twins, So stout, the brothers might have pass'd for Pollux and Castor. And so, at last, his cost and toil, The Marquis was oblig'd to own, Were laid out on a grateful soil, At last, he reap'd as he had sown. MISS IN HER TEENS: CAPTAIN SHADOW'S TALE. TALE III. Miss Molly was almost fourteen, Her Cousin Dick a year older, The diff'rence of a year between Was very easy to be seen, For Dick was grown a year bolder. Though he was grown bolder and braver, Molly grew bashfuller and shier, So serious and so much graver, She hardly would let Dick come nigh her. The year before, upon no score, Would Dick be caught in such a trick, As either peeping through a nick, Or through the key-hole of a door. The year before Miss had no fears, And there was no such thing as squealing; And Dick had neither eyes nor ears, Neither taste, nor smell, nor feeling. Until this year, as I have heard, Dick was unlucky, but not rude; And Molly so far from a prude, Till now her door was never barr'd. One afternoon Mamma rode out, Papa was laid up in the gout: Well, and what became of Molly? If she had taken her to ride, She should have been confin'd and try'd, For flagrant and wilful folly. When they are let out of the cage, Let out without consideration, All children of a certain age, Are given much to observation. Their judgement's so exceeding weak, Their fancy so exceeding strong, That you can neither act nor speak, They are so apt to take things wrong. So neither Miss, nor Dick the sapling, With Madam rides; She is attended by the Chaplain, And none besides. Which of the two were better pleas'd, Is difficult to say, I own. Miss and Papa had been so teaz'd, They both were pleas'd to be alone. Up to her chamber Molly's flown, Fast bolted is her chamber-door, So cautious the damsel's grown, From what Miss Molly was before. Ever since Dick began to pry, Ever since Molly cast her frock, She never ventures to rely On the protection of a lock. Molly suspects her cousin Dick, Her cousin Dick's so plaguy sly, That lock, or any lock, can pick, That Dick has any mind to try. Dick pick the lock! it could not be, If Molly only had the sense, As soon as she had turn'd the key, Not to have taken it from thence. Molly would gladly have compounded, If Dick would let her 'scape so cheap, Whenever Molly was impounded, She left that hole for Dick to peep. She was aware there was no keeping, No hindering cousin Dick from peeping: For sure as ever you're alive, Either with gimlet or skewer, Her cousin Richard would contrive To bore a hole, somewhere to view her. For some particular affair, That Molly had in agitation, She did not at that juncture care, To be expos'd to speculation. She clapp'd a fire-skreen to the hole, To hinder cousin Dick from spying; Little imagining, poor soul! That Dick was in her closet lying. The room, as you have heard me tell, At all times had been Molly's own; The closet was a citadel Of a late date, to awe the town. Mamma had thought upon the case, And thinking made her more afraid, A closet was a dangerous place For stratagem and ambuscade; So the room still to Miss remains, The fort to Mamma appertains. The key that opens this same fort, Mamma had lost, in a strange sort, In riding out, the key she lost; And it was found by Dick at play, Upon the spot where it was toss'd, Upon a heap of new-made hay. Her pad, I fancy, for my part, Is badly broke, and apt to start: And by a sudden jerk or spring, Or swing, or some such thing, Out flew the key, as if a stone Had flown Out of a sling. Pray, where was Miss's great neglect? Where was Molly's indiscretion? This treach'rous key could she suspect To be in cousin Dick's possession? She was so circumspect and cool, Each nook and cranny she survey'd; She even examin'd the close-stool, But Dick was in the closet laid. Whate'er he saw, Dick never told, And that is much for one so young, When people that are twice as old, Have twice as indiscreet a tongue. It must be something very curious, Some strange extraordinary matter; Dick star'd and look'd quite wild and furious Just when he bounc'd out and flew at her. Though she was cruelly betray'd, Dick made up matters very soon, Molly was reconcil'd, Dick stay'd And spent a pleasant afternoon. The point was long, and well debated; But Dick so solemnly protested, By Molly he was reinstated, And with the key fairly invested. Mamma perceiv'd the key was stray'd, And sent the Chaplain out to look; 'Twas not for that she was dismay'd, But she had lost her pocket-book. He found the book, which was the best; As to the key, the careful mother, Before she laid her head to rest, Sent and bespoke just such another. 'Twas well she let the lock remain: Had it been chang'd on his report, It would have caus'd infinite pain, And spoil'd a deal of harmless sport. In a short time Molly grew sick, Every day sicker and sicker; Molly's complaints came very thick, Every day thicker and thicker. She was advis'd to change the air; She did, but no-body knows where. Molly came home a different thing, Both in her shape and every feature, From what she went away in spring, You never saw a virgin sweeter. 'Squire Noddy coming from his travels, By Molly is a captive led; He to her Sire his mind unravels, Her Sire consents, and Molly's wed. It is six years that 'Squire Noddy Has had the care of Molly's body; And they have children half a dozen; But what is very odd is this, That none of all the six should miss, But every one be like her cousin. ZACHARY'S TALE; OR THE SUSPICIOUS HUSBAND CURED; ODE TO ZACHARY Z. M Zachary Moore.. Esquire, A living Monument Of the Friendship and Generosity of the Great; After an Intimacy of thirty Years, With most of the great Personages of these Kingdoms, Who did him the Honour to assist him In the laborious Work Of getting to the far End of a great Fortune, These his Noble Friends, From Gratitude for the many happy Days and Nights Enjoy'd by his Means, Exalted him, through their Influence, In the forty-seventh Year of his Age, To an Ensigncy; Which he actually enjoys at present In Gibraltar. Omnis Aristippum decuit, color, et modus, et res— Nunc in Aristippi furtim præcepta relabor, Et mihi res, non me rebus submittere conor— The Actors in this Dramatic Tale, are The Suspicious Husband, Angravalle. His Wife, Bindocchia. Her Friend, Paulina. Her Husband's Friend, Niceno. Scene NAPLES. What sober heads hast thou made ake? How many hast thou kept from nodding? How many wise-ones, for thy sake, Have flown to thee, and left off plodding? Thou wouldst, although the grave-ones shake Their solemn locks, and strike one mute, As soon be in the infernal lake, As in the place of Pitt or Bute; Whose heads incessantly send forth Projects with glittering trains, like squibs, And scatter, through the South and North, Vollies of Ministerial Fibs. Asleep, down precipices hurry'd, Or, like Prometheus, chain'd to rocks— By vultures gnaw'd, or monsters worry'd, Hell-hounds, whose cry is, Dei Vox— Or, victims to a heavier curse, They dream they're dup'd, and fall unpity'd; To fall a dupe is ten times worse Than to be worried and Dewitted. Philosophy and Grace is thine, Not spiritual Grace, but sprightly; Inspir'd by the God of Wine, Inspir'd like old Anacreon nightly. That Light divine, that heavenly Grace, I fear, alas! thou wouldst not chuse; That shines and blackens Whitefield's face, Like the japan upon his shoes. Whether thy Grace from Heaven descends, Or rises from the earth below, Oft hast thou rais'd thy helpless friends, Oft given thy purse unto thy foe.— Who gives his foe his purse outright Shews plain, if I have any skill, Not only that he bears no spite, But that he bears him a good-will. And also is perhaps as meek, And is as little of a bite, As he who only gives his cheek (For Lesly gives nought else) to smite; Or Whitefield, emptying the pockets Of whores, and bawds, and gaping throngs; Turning his eyes out of their sockets, Singing and selling David's songs. Now thou art gone, where can I find Spirit and ease above controul, Serenity and health of mind, And gaiety and strength of soul? Precepts I find, examples none, And guides as blind as a guide stone. The sportive Muse is my Physician, To cure the folly, and the madness, Of pride of Envy, and Ambition, Of Spleen, and melancholy Sadness. Soon as I touch the jocund lyre, That instant, driven from their seat, The dæmons of the mind retire, And go and persecute the Great. O! may their torments never cease, May they be scourg'd both night and day, Till they have brought thee back in peace, And then, like thee, may they be ever gay! ZACHARY'S TALE. TALE IV. PART the FIRST. This is so long a Tale, that Zachary thought it would be better divided into Two Parts. Bandello lived in the sixteenth century, in high reputation for his wit, and corresponded with all the great men of that age. He retired into France upon the taken of Milan by the Spaniards, at which time all his papers wer burnt. In 1551 he was made Bishop of Agen in France, where his Novels were first published. Outcried against writings, composed with no worse intention than to promote good-humour and chearfulness, by fighting against the Tædium Vitæ, were reserved for an age of refined hypocrisy. There ought to be a great distinction between obscenity, evidently designed to inflame the passions, and a ludicruous liberty, which is frequently necessary to shew th etrue ridicule of hypocritical characters, which can give offence to none, but such as are afriad of every thing that has a tendency to unmasking. The second part of this Tale is upon a different plan from Bandello's. Zachary has told the Bishop's Tale with more modestly than the Bishop, and I think the catastrophe is more natural. The best edition of Bandello is printed at Lucca in 1554; and reprinted in London, in three volumes, quarto, 1740. How oft has Boccace been translated And blunder'd, And Jean Fontaine assassinated And plunder'd! Where is the land where Boccace and Fontaine Have not in effigy been slain? Fontaine they imitate and turn, Boccace they represent and render, Just as the figures, made to burn, Are like the Pope and the Pretender. Why mayn't Bandello have a rap? Why mayn't I imitate Bandello? There never was a Prelate's cap Bestow'd upon a droller fellow. Like Tristram, in mirth delighting; Like Tristram, a pleasant Writer; Like his, I hope that Tristram's writing Will be rewarded with a mitre. There was a Knight, says our Bishop, A Knight from Aragon in Spain, So jealous, that you cannot fish up His like and paragon again: He serv'd Alphonsus many years, Both in the wars and in affairs of state, And fell in love up to the ears, And would not give it up at any rate. By bribes and flattery he won Father, mother, daughter, and son. And yet he serenaded, sigh'd, And was long doubtful of his doom, Before he gain'd his lovely Bride, With all the rights of a Bridegroom. And after that, they also tell us, That in less time than you would think, He grew so timorous and jealous, He could not sleep o'nights a wink. He was not jealous, says the Tale, All the time he was in training; 'Twas not till he began to fail, And to fall off, by over-straining. As soon as ever he train'd off, The nights she pass'd can scarce be told; All night he could do nought but cough, Torment, and tantalize, and scold, Bindocchia was lively and alert, And had no notion of a bridle; She requir'd one, not only more expert, But one as active as her spouse was idle. Now Angravalle knew all this, As well as either you or I, When he thought proper to dismiss Those, on whose help she might rely. He dismiss'd both the men and maids All together; Birds of a feather; Rogues, and intriguing jades; All but a fellow with a surly look, Gard'ner, butler, groom, and cook: And, to cut off all hopes to come, From an intriguing maid at least, He pick'd up one both deaf and dumb, And neither fit for man nor beast— Besides, he had such crotches in his pate, And such strange notions, She could not cross the room without her mate To watch her motions. Bindocchia was to be pity'd, So watch'd, so scolded, so ill fitted. Considering cuckoldom's a sentence, That cannot be revers'd and null, By commutation nor repentance, Nor by his Holiness's Bull: I cannot think he was to blame, So much as many folks pretend, To shut his doors, and to disclaim All intercourse with every friend. Those cuckolds, it can't be disputed, That either heaven or earth can boast, Have been, and always are, cornuted By those in whom they trust the most. However, all were not deny'd; He had a friend he valu'd next his life; A friend that he had often try'd; One, by good luck, related to his wife. He was admitted, night or day, To dine or sup, Or to step up, If he was not inclin'd to stay. Niceno had an equal share In the affections of this pair. After much thought and perturbation, Bindocchia grew to have less care, For the continual defalcation In Angravalle's bills of fare.— Though you may think her patience strange, She thought, but not without some doubt, The posture of affairs would change, That things would turn, and come about. Two months were gone, which was a shame, Without receiving any news, Though she had oft put in her claim, And often stickled for her dues; The longer he was in arrear, Her case and his grew still more queer. In short, there was no end of waiting; Her husband grew so great a debtor, There was no way of calculating The chances of his growing better.— Now, Ladies, I desire to know, In such a situation, Was it unnatural, or no, To cast her eyes on her Relation? Observe, I said, to cast her eyes; With those 'twas natural to speak; To mingle also a few sighs With a few roses in each cheek: Except a blush, a sigh, a soft regard, All other forms of speech are barr'd. Accordingly, within her lips She had a tongue in due subjection; Not apt to wander, and make slips, Without her order and direction. One day she went, upon leave granted, To see her Cousin—pray, take notice, Sirs! A female that she often haunted, Niceno's Cousin too, as well as her's; As usual, attended by the Mute, And by the Gardener, her fellow-brute.— Paulina was her Cousin's name, A perfect Saint in her demeanour; Though she was spotless in her fame, Never was any thing uncleaner: She could impose upon the Wise and Grave, And could, with Titus, safely swear; She never lost a day that she could save, Nor sav'd a night that she could spare. Bindocchia told her husband's case, His former feats were not deny'd; But then his subsequent disgrace By rhetoric was amplify'd. By what means, or by what discovery, Her Friend reply'd, can you be sure, That Angravalle's past recovery, That he is even past your cure? There's a disorder we call Fumbling, Amongst the men call'd Fighting shy, Teazing, tumbling, squeezing, mumbling, Still worse and worse, the more they try. Upon our skill in this disease All our whole happiness depends; All our importance, all our ease, All our pow'r of obliging friends. We must, when call'd to their assistance, Chearfully undergo the Law: 'Tis death to them to shew resistance, And worse than death to laugh, or pshaw. With all their humours, all their fancies, In every form, in every shape, We must comply; nay, make advances, To help them out of such a scrape. 'Tis by this single piece of skill That I command and rule, And make my headstrong mule Submit entirely to my will. Bindocchia, indeed, I fear, That you, like many a haughty Beauty, Think that your goods ought to come clear Of every charge, and every duty: And so they will, my dear, by smuggling; But the foundation must be laid By honest industry and struggling; By credit in a lawful trade. Have you, with both your mind and might, Endeavour'd to set matters right? Casting her eyes upon a crucifix, That hung within her cousin's bed; Bindocchia said, I have try'd all the tricks That ever enter'd in a head. I could as soon persuade those thieves To steal away, and leave their crosses; Or the fall'n tree with wither'd leaves To rise and to repair its losses. There never will be life within that lump, Till the dead rise at the last trump. Paulina, this is my decree, My spouse must have a Coadjutor; His Friend, all precedents agree, Should be preferred to every suitor. I need not tell you whom I mean, Nor ask my Friend to go between: He has had innuendos many: But make Niceno understand, That any scruples, if he has any, Are just like letters wrote on sand; Or like the fears of truant boys, Which interrupt their brisk career, And for a moment damp their joys, But the next moment disappear; Or like a boy in brief dispute, Whether it is a sin to pull A pocket full of tempting fruit, And rob an orchard that's quite full: Nature decides, and doubt no longer hampers; He fills his pockets, and he scampers. In fine, Paulina relish'd her design; Her friend, by the same guard escorted, Return'd to her old station. That night Paulina, 'tis reported, Finish'd her negotiation: Her arguments had so much weight, Niceno gave up the debate. Bindocchia, put upon her mettle, Assembles and convenes Her powers, and all her wits, to settle And find out ways and means: She had not been an hour acquainted With her Friend's motion and success, Till she was taken ill and fainted, And carry'd off, and forc'd t'undress. Her mouth was drawn aside and purs'd, Her head turn'd like the flying chair That children ride in at a fair; Her stomach swell'd, and like to burst. All night in bed she made a riot, Her husband thought she was possess'd, She never had a moment's quiet, Nor he a single minute's rest. Just at the time that the cock crew, Out of the bed Bindocchia flew; In the next chamber was a water-closet, Where she began to grunt and moan, As if she was making a deposit, And was delivering a stone. Her husband rose and follow'd near; And, if she had been off her guard, She could have heard with half an ear, He puff'd, and fetch'd his breath so hard; By smothering his cough he kept a wheezing, Which for a list'ner is as bad as sneezing. Hearing him wheeze, she blew a gale, That seem'd to issue from behind, And made her husband turn his sail, And brush away before the wind. So well did she perform her part, Trumpeting with her mouth and hand; He had no mistrust of any art, Or any dealings contraband. At every foul report and crack, That she in agony let fly, He mov'd, and slunk a little back, Like a judicious able spy. Scarce were they laid till he began to snore: Bindocchia started out of bed once more, And soon spoil'd Angravalle's snoring; He thought it was a kettle-drum, For never any mortal bum Made such a rattling and roaring. Again he was upon his feet, Again she was all wind and griping; Again he made a safe retreat, The instant that he heard her wiping. His jealous freaks were never so kept under, But they would quickly shoot and flower, To every one's astonishment and wonder, Like mushrooms in a thunder-shower. The moment he began to doze, It was in vain to think of sleeping; She started up, whipt on her cloaths, Ran off, and he came after creeping. Till broad day-light, There was no sign at all of ending, For she kept going all the night, And he kept list'ning and attending. The female cousins, with much laughter, Concerted all the scenes hereafter. Next day, the better to impose, She kept her bed, fatigu'd with purging; And yet Bindocchia often rose, Her provocations were so urging. The night was like the night before, Hurrying, trumpeting, dispatching; The same attendant at the door For ever listening and catching, Till he was weary'd out and spent, And quite convinc'd no harm was meant. At three o'clock that very morning (An hour convenient for horning) Niceno, punctual to his call, In the next chamber was in waiting, Convey'd thro' a window of the hall, Without much doubting and debating. There was no servant there to fear, Except the Mute, and none slept sounder, And she so deaf, she could not hear Ev'n an eight-and-forty pounder. The Gardener, by way of Groom, The only one watchful and able, Laid at a distance in a room Over the stable. And now Bindocchia went to reap The fruits of all her labour; Whilst Angravalle was asleep, She entertain'd his neighbour, He was so pleasant and engaging, She stay'd with him three hours at least; And, though he wak'd coughing and raging, Her Husband could not spoil their feast. They went on joyously, for nothing caring, (So keen is hunger) Regarding him no more than a cheese-paring, Or a Cheesemonger. She groan'd, she trumpeted, and crack'd, And made a noise so diabolic, You would have sworn she had been rack'd, And torn to pieces with the cholic. I may thank you for all I feel, Cry'd she, to Angravalle, coughing; If one was made of brass or steel, You soon would wear one out to nothing. Three months with cold have I been dying, By your ingenious way of lying; Such usage is not to be borne, Tossing and kicking cloaths and sheets! And never cover'd night nor morn! I could lie better in the streets I Thus things being come to a conclusion, Niceno stole away, she shut up shop, Jump'd into bed without the least confusion, Scolded a while, and slept sound as a top. END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. At noon she rose, recover'd quite; Her colour and her eyes confess'd, They were so radiant and bright, That natural physic is the best: As Angravalle had foretold, Natural physic carry'd off her cold. What could not be foretold so well, What he could only hope, at most, That night she rais'd him, like a spell Raising the devil or a ghost. Her charms and efforts were so great, His cure was completed; Nay, 'twas so thoroughly complete, That all the proofs were twice repeated. But this, she knew, she could not long rely on, Nor would it do by half; Unless a lamb will satisfy a lion, That can digest a calf. That half is far more than the whole, In former times, was Hesiod's thought; She was persuaded from her soul, That half is only more than nought; And consequently less than half must stand, Just like a cypher, plac'd on the left hand. This very sudden revolution Caus'd in her Husband a revulsion, Which caus'd a sudden resolution To yield, and follow its impulsion. His country-house wanting repairing, He thought to take a three-days airing. Though he had vow'd a trust unshaken For his Bindocchia's late merits; For all the trouble she had taken, To comfort him, and raise his spirits; Yet when he bade his wife adieu, His jealousy broke out anew, He left the Gardener instructed; He was to watch and lie perdu, To see how matters were conducted, And to report upon a view: And after this the Knight departed, Sadly foreboding and faint-hearted. His Lady knew, that time, like riches, Should be enjoy'd; Which are but lumber in one's breeches, When unemploy'd: Her greatest happiness she ow'd To time judiciously bestow'd. Paulina was directed strait The Coadjutor to secure; He was that night to officiate In Angravalle's vacant cure: Three morns he serv'd the morning service, Three afternoons, afternoon function, Three nights, like any monk or dervise, He labour'd with great zeal and unction. After such business and hurry, It ever was my confident belief, That he was rather glad than sorry, When Angravalle came to his relief; Though the last night an accident fell out, That might alarm a man less stout. Returning through the garden late, He spy'd, within the avery, The Gardener lying in wait To perpetrate some knavery. Although betray'd, He knew his Cousin's parts too well To be afraid Of aught the Gardener could tell; Nor ventur'd, in affairs so nice, To interpose his own advice. As to all salutary measures, He trusted to that native wit, Abounding in inventive treasures, And inexhaustible as Pitt.— In State Affairs, if not in Letters, Niceno may be an example, When we give credit to our betters, To make it generous and ample. Bindocchia thus, upon the brink of ruin, Smil'd at the mischief that was brewing. She was peeping through her window-lattice Just when she heard her Husband's rap; Not as a rat is, A rat that's peeping through a trap; But as a cat is, A cat with a considering cap. Whilst he was knocking at the gate, Bindocchia slily descended; She knew the temper of her Mate, Enough to guess what he intended; Having, incog, upon occassions, Assisted at his consultations. The council-room was under-ground, Where he repair'd when he alighted: The bill against his Spouse was found— And the poor soul to be indicted; A trial was decreed, Proceedings settled and agreed. The Court broke up, all parties to their task Till things should be reveal'd, Bindocchia issu'd from an empty cask, Where she had lain conceal'd. Her Husband took a turn or two To smooth the wrinkles on his brow— Then smiling, like a mind at ease, He march'd up to his Lady's chamber, And found Bindocchia on her knees Before a crucifix of amber: A situation, That he beheld with indignation. But he kept down his swelling bile, Inform'd by sober reason, That his revenge, delay'd awhile, Would not be less in season; She neither mov'd her eye, nor her eye-brow, Till she had sung the Litany quite through. Then rising with a chearful air, So modest, and so unaffected, That Angravalle well might stare, When he consider'd and reflected. However, with some perturbation, He stammer'd this Oration. I must return—this afternoon, On bus'ness, that I can't neglect; To-morrow I will be here—soon; Sooner, perhaps—than you expect. I thought, if I did not appear, Knowing how great your love and care is, That you would certainly, my Dear, Be full of fears and quandaries— So I must instantly go back, As soon as I have got a snack. Whilst this same snack was getting ready, Paulina call'd upon her scholar, A circumstance that kept him steady— And help'd him to digest his choler. His meal dispatch'd, he set out in an amble, Full of his great and wise intentions. Bindocchia, in a short preamble, Explain'd her doubts and apprehensions, Laid open all her plans and schemes, Her arguments and speculations, Which were so far from being dreams, Paulina thought them revelations; Her schemes, like Harlequinery, Were all dumb shew and scenery; The whole so artfully invented, So free from all affected airs; It must succeed, if represented By any tolerable players. Paulina had a part assign'd, In which her cousin knew she shin'd. They were resolv'd to try the event, And set about it with good-will, Knowing, before the night was spent, They might be forc'd to shew their skill— Which made Paulina hasten home, To be prepar'd against the time to come. Paulina told the Gard'ner in the entry, To mind her message, and take heed, To leave his post where he was sentry, And let his Lady know with speed, That she had quite forgot to say, The message he was to convey:— That she had bus'ness in the town, But she would send the fringe and lace, Drawings and patterns for the gown, By her own maid the Bolognoise. Bindocchia might keep her slattern, Keep her all night, if she requir'd, Till she had drawn and done the pattern, And the designs that she desir'd. Though these were terms to him like Greek, Yet he deliver'd his commission, And did, as well as he could speak, Deliver it with great precision. And now as soon as it was night He lock'd the gates of the great court, And introduc'd the jealous Knight By a back way, or sally-port. Within the av'ry, in ambuscade, His Lord and Master watch'd and pray'd. Being inform'd how matters went, That none had enter'd since his going, Except a wench Paulina sent, A wench to draw designs for sewing, A Bolognoise with scarf and veil, Twanging through the nose and snuffing, As if she had been from head to tail Loaded with a Naples stuffing. The night was still, the moon was bright, When he, in an ill-fated hour, Discover'd plainly, by her light— Niceno passing by his bow'r On which, with might and resolution, He put his wrath in execution. Our jealous Knight, in the first place, Summoned all his wife's relations, As witnesses of her disgrace, And of his sufferings and patience; Dragging along, with many others, His Lady's father, and her brothers. How did her brothers storm, her father weep! When, op'ning her room-door, upon the bed, They all beheld the Lovers fast asleep, Upon her bosom lay Niceno's head. But when they saw the Lovers rise, How great their wonder! what must they suppose! They hardly could believe their eyes, Seeing Paulina in Niceno's cloaths— And here the injur'd wife began to hector, Reading aloud the following lecture:— His jealous fits were every hour, Nay, every minute, growing stronger, Till he had put it past my power To bear his folly any longer. Having observ'd the jealous fool Following me when I was sick, Every time I went to stool, I own it touch'd me to the quick. Paulina's goodness and devotion Were shock'd at my determination, Insisting it was a rash notion, Although she own'd the provocation; Advising me to club our wits, To try to cure my husband's fits. Whilst Angravalle was away, Indeed, I blush whilst I am speaking, I spy'd the Gard'ner, where he lay, Watching like a thief, and sneaking. So, having found the thing I sought, A key that turn'd the garden-lock, I was transported with the thought Of punishing my stupid block. Paulina, as she had often done, Borrow'd her cousin's cloaths, and in the garden, In order to complete our fun, Appear'd before the Gardener, my warden. My spouse, we did not doubt the least, Would be inform'd, as we desir'd; We knew that the suspicious beast With rage and vengeance would be fir'd. His second trip, we judged, was to deceive; It happen'd just as we suppos'd: And now I humbly do conceive, He is sufficiently expos'd.— This is the true and perfect history, Of all this mystery: And now I do insist, his temper such is, To be deliver'd from his clutches. Her husband, conscious of her merit, Acknowledg'd his transgressions; She spoke with so much force and spirit, He promis'd before all the sessions, If she would pardon what was past, That this offence should be the last. And, as a proof that his designs were good, The Gard'ner should be discarded; She should chuse servants, and go where she would Unguarded. Bindocchia consented, And never afterwards repented. Paulina to her maid retir'd, Which maid was not according to the letter, But in this fashion was attir'd, On purpose to conceal Niceno better. So well he acted, I'll engage, That this Niceno might have play'd, On any theatre or stage, The snuffling Bolognia maid. Paulina dress'd herself before she went, Her maid had brought her cloaths for that intent. People that I suspect for scoffers Pretend that, whilst Paulina was undressing, Niceno made her handsome offers, Which she could not refuse, he was so pressing. They were together, 'tis confess'd, Two hours before she could get dress'd. However 'twas is undecided, But as to him he was complete, In every circumstance provided, And fit to serve a pious cheat; But, to be able to serve two, Is more than I, perhaps, or you, can do. THE PRIVY-COUNSELLOR'S AND THE STUDENT OF LAW'S TALE. A MANUSCRIPT. FOUND AT CRAZY-CASTLE. Supposed to be written about the time of Henry VIII PROLOGUE TO THE PRIVY-COUNSELLOR'S AND THE STUDENT OF LAW'S TALE. Once on a time, how many years ago, As I could nivir learn, you cannot know, A Member of the Parliament, And a Law-student his relation, Rode out of town with no intent, Unless it was for recreation. Full sixty is the Member, and hath seen Many a famous King and comely Queen.— In yvery reign, in yvery age, He florish'd in prosperitie; In the beginning was a Page, Now Privy-Counsellor is he. His personage is grave and full of state, Yielding him weight and vantage in debate; But with a boon-companion gay and free; No ceremony, no mysterious airs; Just as a Privy-Counsellor should be, If he had been a Page of the Back-stairs. The Student's Father is in perfect health, Thank God, and waxes daily strong in wealth; Wants not his son to get a heap, But just enough of Law To guard his own estate, and keep The neighbourhood in awe; And I dare venture to maintain, Herein his Father's hopes shall not be vain. Allbeit, he doth not attend the Courts, And redith none but Geoffery's Reports; Yet Plowden lying ever on the table, Opin and spread, He is counted full as able, As if he had him in his head. So, as I signify'd before, these two Ride out of town, having nought else to do. Six miles from town this member hath a box, For contemplation good; Where he retires, as thoughtful as an ox Chewing his cud. He creeps into his box of stone, Sometimes for pleasure, oftener for whim: Or when he is tir'd of every one, Or every one is tir'd of him. It is call'd a Box, and there's a reason why, Because therein a man lays himself by.— Within a box, if you your cloaths conceal, The fashion and the worms conspire, To make a suit, that was genteel, Fit only for the Sheriff of a shire; But good enough for you, If in your box you lie too long perdu. When you come out again 'twill be too late; You and your coat will both be out of date.— Here then they 'light, and now suppose them dining; Suppose them also grumbling and repining; The bacon's fusty, and the fowls are tough; The mutton over-done, the fish not done enough; The cloth is drawn, the wine before them set; Wine, like themselves, entirely on the fret: Muttering their prayers, exchanging looks askew, Just like two rival beauties in a pew. What might have happen'd no one can decide, Had not, by fortune or design, The Butler in the cellar spy'd A hoard of admirable wine. Bounce goes the cork; sparkles the glass; Cousin, here's to your favourite lass: And here their purgatory ends; For after this They enter into perfect bliss, Drinking like perfect friends: Drinking, because drinking promoteth joaking; Joaking, without insulting or provoking. The evening finishes with equal glory, The worthy Counsellor proposing To make a closing, By telling each a merry story. I have one fram'd, says he, in Geoffry's phrase; Geoffry's, the Courtiers' language of those days. The Student likes the motion well; Says he, I'll answer you with one quite new— My tale in courtly speech I cannot tell; But I can tell a merry tale, and true. THE PRIVY-COUNSELLOR'S TALE. TALE V. Reignid in Yorkshire one of mity fame, Clepid Clepid, called. king Grig, as Kronikels proclaim; Thilk Thilk, this same. Prince delighted ay in mirth and sport, Japis Japis, jests. and jollitries of yvery sort; And now when pepil lough, and rage Rage, frolic., and play, Folk name them merry Grigs until this day.— This King, I undirstond, hath venimid his blud Venimid his blud, tainted., Whereby he hath lost his corage and his rud Corage and his rud, his strength, his spirits, and complexion.; Sore shent Shent, hurt. is he by Cupid and his mother, And woe-begone far more than any other.— The Kingis mother dere, Queen Whity hight Hight, called., Because her heer Heer, hair., allso her skin is white, Is Queen of Cortesy, and Beautis Pride, Gentil and modest as a maidin bride. She sends to Potikers and Leeches Leeches, physicians. grave, Prays them to spare his life, and membris save; Ne drogue ne instroment mote him avail; His joints are losen'd, and his cheekis pale; And he that erst Erst, formerly. would sing, and laugh, and jeer, Hath not he smilid once in haf Haf, half. a year. There is a Conjorer, a sottil Wight Sottil wight, a cunning fellow.; This Conjorer the Queen consults by night. The Neekromanzir, according to his guise, Casteth his figures, poreth on the skies, And redith how to cure the Kingis woe; His Grace until an heling-well shall go, And bath his lims for sivin nights therein; And sivin maidins, strippid to the skin, Shall frote Frote, rub. his body, till one, by her devise And cunning touching, hele him in a trice. Both King and Queen, you may be very sure, Are in great haste to set about the cure. Now is she setten forth in brave array, And with the sely Sely, sick. King upon her way; Yccompany'd Yccompany'd, accompany'd. with Minstrels and japers Japers, Jesters., Jugglirs and Morrice-dancers, cutting capers; One time that thing which Ministers delite Shall, in another season, breed dispite; For when the King is sad, it is ungracious thing If everich-one Everich, every. is merrier than the King. In this sort journeying, they come at last Unto the well, wherein the King him cast; His body chafid is, with special care, By sivin naked damsills passing fair. The King hath view'd them well in every piece Piece, part., Withouten splint, or malanders, or grease; Hard are their breastis, skin as smothe as glass; Plomp be their bottoks, and as tight as brass; Smale are their feet; each feature, every limb, Lies in the fairest form, and sweetest trim.— The Queen examinid hath craftily For Maidins of the best virginity; None of these sivin hath spilt her maidins-hede, As in these days moch reson was to drede. Handlid and chafid with sick Sick, such. daintyness Daintyness, elegance., Wexid the King to gather lustyness Lustyness, strength, health, &amp;c.; And notabul Notabul, plain. it is to everich Everich, every. eye, How he is rais'd and cherished thereby. The sivinth day they all are out of pain; Symptome of helth appearid very plain; Whereat the Queen rejoices as is need, Honoring the Maidin who hath done the deid; And yet when he returnid hath to Court, The King mote Mote, might. not be pleas'd in any sort; And all that Lords and Ladys can invent, Shall but encrease the Kingis discontent; Wherfor the dutyfull Queen hieth her, And counselleth again the Conjorer. He spieth, in his secret Boke of Magie Boke of Magie, Conjuring-book., How the same Maidins mote Mote, might. him rectifie Rectifie, set him to rights.; And yvery buxom Maid shall speke a tale, And yvery Maid to make him lough assail; And she that makes him lough shall thence be led, And have the Kingis company in bed; In bed, or any other pleasant place, Wherever it shall please the Kingis Grace. And lo the Queen these joyful tidings bears To Chappil, where the Maidins are at prayers.— Away the Maidins hurry them from Matins, Apparrelling themselves in silks and sattins; And all the sivin Damzils, out of hand, Are set before the King at his command.— He doth ordain each Maid to speke by lot; Allso, because ne word shall be forgot, A Scribe is there to notice all they say.— And now six Maids have talk'd for haf a day; And yet, for all the talking they can make, They scarce can keep the Kingis Grace awake. Then came the sivinth Maidin in degree, But cannot speke her tale for modesty. My tale, saies she, I wold begin, but fear A word unseemly to a modest ear; My tale without this word cannot be told, And to deliver it I am not bold.— What means the Maidin? quoth the King in ire In ire, in a passion., You may gloze Gloze, to wrap up ænigmatically. any word, if you enquire Enquire, study.. I am no Clerk Clerk, scholar., saies she, her Grace well knows, Pleasith you, Sir, may teach me how to gloze Gloze, to wrap up ænigmatically.; Bot I will trie to do the best I may, That you may better frame what I would say.— Of all God's creatures its the choicest fare, Yet he that has the least, has the best share. I shall not graunt your prayer, the King reply'd, Riddils are derk; and Paraphrase is wide: Bot well I know the Latin and the Dutch, Of Fraunce and Toscany I have a touch: Now, any of these tongues, if you're inclin'd, Fair Maid, may seem to shape what you would find. Dutch, quoth the Queen, my son, the maid demands, It is a tongue no Christian undirstands. Well, quoth the King, fair Maid, this dredefull name, That werkith in you so much strife and shame, Pronounce they Fotz throughout all Germany; Now you may speke your story hardily Hardily, boldly..— Sir, quoth the buxom Maid, upon a time, A jolly Knight there was in all his prime, Soot Soot, sweet. were his eyes, and manly was his face, Lusty his limbs, his body in good case; A piercing and a pleasant wit withall, Ne vice had he, but that his means Means, Fortune, Estate. were small: Here the king turning, doth the Scribe beseech, To lose no word, nor sentence of her speech. Upon a joyful tide Joyful Tide, Time of Festivity., the King of Kent Proclamid hath a noble turnament, There yvery Knight enforced is to be; Unless he will be held of villanie Held of Villanie, degraded and reduced to the condition of a Vassal.; Our Knight, Sir Amador the debonaire, Mote thither with his Squire and steed repair: And having traveled five days anend Anend, strait forwards., The Knight and Squire unto a meadow wend Wend, arriv'd., Ynamilid with pinks and cowslips gay, Thro' which a rivir glides as bright as summir-day. Upon the banks grows many a beachin tree, And many a spreding oak most fair to see; There they espied in the cristal lake, Three nakid damzills of an hevenly make; Their wimples Wimples, Neck-kerchiefs. and their gowns of broudid Broudid, embroider'd. silk, Ywrought with gold, their smokkis white as milk, And all their costly garments were display'd Undir an aged oak's ynticing shade. Behold the Knightis color changeth hue, At sight so unexpected and so new; Not that Acteon's hap ydraddid Ydraddid, fear'd. he, Worried belike for sik Sik, the like. audacity. The Knight he blosh'd, because he thote Thote, thought. within, Such nakidness shall make a saint to sin.— Gazeth Sir Amador with all his mite, Tasteth thereof the 'Squire but brief delite, For being more ynclined unto prey, Stealid their smokkis and their robes away. The Maidins noted the unworthy Swain, And calling to the Knight, declare their pain; Soon the ynragid Knight arrests the Squire, And turnith to the Maids with their attire, Making excuses, he could do no less, For his intrusion on their nakidness, And with profound respect and reverence, Saluting each by turns he bears him hence. He is hardly gone, before they all agree, They should have done the Knight some cortesy; And call him back; the eldest Suster spoke, Sir, we be Fairys living by this broke Broke, brook., And sikirly Sikirly, certainly. unfit it is for us, That have such power, to be discourteous; Wherfore some tokins at our hands receive, And for myself, this tokin will I leave: Wymen to pleasure you shall ever strive In any land, so long as you're alive; And you shall nivir fail in wymen's pleasure, And when you please, shall please them without measure. The second Fairy saith, Sir Knight, my tokin Is of a nature wondros to be spokin.— And now the Damzill's tale cannot proceed; Her face, as any burning coal, is rede. Quoth then the King, divining sottely, The word you seek is Fotz, assuredly: True, saies the Maid; and so the Fairy saith, That whosoever Fotz he questioneth, Shall make an answer, or if none she gives, The Fotz shall fare the worse for't whilst she lives. My Suster, quoth the third, under correction, Your tokin's good, but lacketh of perfection, The Fotz may be, by accidental cause, So busy that she cannot move her jaws; Whenever this doth happen, I intend Her next door neighbour answer for her friend.— The King no longer can refrain from laughter, Also the Queen herself him follows after. I will reward you well for this anon; Mean time, quoth he, my pritty Maid, go on. The Knight ne yvir Ne yvir, never. having seen a fay Fay, Fairy., Thinketh they japen Japen, banter. him in that they say— He overtakes the Squire, and on they ride, Discoursing on the Fairys, side by side; Happened a Freer Freer, Friar. of a neighboring abbey, Rideth abroad in gallant pomp that day, Mounted he is upon a dapple mare, And looketh altogether void of care; Rosy his cheeks, a twinkling hazle eye, He seemid Patriarke of Venerie; Or Pontif of renowned Baal-Peor Baal-Peor, or Baal-Phegor, from whence, perhaps, Pego, and the adjunct ??????, whose priests are opprobricusly called ???????, or Followers of Baal Beor; who, according to Dr. Middleton, was a god of the Moabites, the same with Priapus. (See Germana quædam monumenta, by Dr. Conyers Middleton, S. T. P. in quarto, page 65, with two monuments elegantly engraved of ??????-????.) The Doctor says, from the authority of the Fathers, that he was the hobby-horse of the women of Israel, page 69.—That the new-married women had an Idolum Tentiginis, which our language is incapable of rendering; and, that they not only took great delight in getting astride of this idol, but they were enjoined to do so as a religious ceremony. The Doctor has given a description of one of these idols, which he has had the good fortune to see at Rome. As our Ladies are not under any obligation to practise all the ceremonies of the Ladies of Israel, I am less concerned at my want of erudition to explain to them sufficiently the meaning of several of the Doctor's terms. The idol's head is like the head of a cock, but instead of a beak, is a stupendous Fascinum: upon the base is inscribed, ????? ??????, the Saviour of the World. I cannot believe (however respectable the authority) that the children of the Roman nobility wore the Fascinum about their necks: I do not mean that it is an unbecoming ornament; one may be easily convinced of the contrary, by casting an eye upon the two belonging to the Doctor and his friend Dr. Warren, with which, as I said before, he has obliged the Public, in his Genuine Antiquities; but, considering the ingenuity of the Romans, why might not their Fascinum be the same, and for the same purpose, as that of the Chinese!—If the Doctor had seen those of Mrs. Chenivix, he certainly would have been of another opinion. But what is the most remarkable of all is, that in the Chinese language ????? signifies a charm. A convincing argument of the weakness of an hypothesis, supported only by the etymology of words.; Certes you shall not oft meet such a Freer. The Knight accosteth him, noteth the beast, The dapple mare that bears the stately priest; Fotz, saies the Knight, I question thee to say, Whither thy master hieth him this way? Finding she needs must answer him par force, Distinctly answers Fotz, tho' somewhat hoarse, What you require I will deliver brief: My master is avowterer Avowterer, adulterer. and thief; He hath robb'd the sacresty of churches plate, And to his lemman Lemman, mistress. beareth it in state.— The Priest, astony'd such a voice to find, Believeth Sathanas is there behind; Descendeth from the mare, voweth repentaunce, Leaving the Knight talking with new acquaintance; The Priest is lame, and no great haste can make; He waddles like a duck eftir a drake. Fotz, quoth the Knight, pray tell me as we go, What is it makes the Freer waddil so? Sir, quoth the Fotz, about a year agon, Our Abbot and my Master, Freer John, Discoursing, riding round the Abbot's Perk, Of leachery and prankis in the derk; The Abbot softly rounith Rounith, whispers. brother John, All fauncies have I proven Proven, tried. everich one, Whereby a man may find the greatest joy, The pleasantest his talent to employ— Yet thereto, though I oft have been inclin'd, Have not I yvir practic'd out of kind Out of kind, unnaturally.. Nor I, says Freer John, I do declare; Trie we then, says the Abbot, with the mare: But reason giveth property the place, Wherfor thyself shalt have the first embrace. Freer consents, and, for his evil deeds, Ungirds the cords whereon he strings the beads; Bindeth therewith mine hinder leggis twain, Holdeth me fast the Abbot by the rein; And letting go his steed, he praunceth by, And with a kick lamid the Freer's thigh; Else had I been, upon my corp'ral oath, Ravyshed by a Freer and Abbot both. Now forward Knight and strange companion trots, Laughing the Knight, and communing with Fotz: Upon a hill not far they do descry A cassil fair, with towris Towris, towers. broad and high; Shaped their course unto the cassil strait; Opin'd the Porter hath the cassil-gate. The Seneschal had led the Squire and Knight Through goodly chambris curiosly bedight, Unto an hall hung round with tapestry, Of Pharoh's host, drenchid Drenchid, drowned. in the Rede Sea; There at their supper sit the Gouvernante, Or Lady of the Cassil, and her Ant; This Lady is a Wedo fresh and young And froliksome, and hath a merry tong Tong, tongue.— And looks so kind, and sings such lovesome strains, No marvel that her Lord hath brast Brast, broke. his reins. Welcome, Sir Knight, saies she, unto my board, I have not seen a Nobler since my Lord. The Knight and Squire sit them down to eat, The board is cover'd with all kind of meat; Rich wines the pages pour in chrystal glass, And many a choice conceit and laugh doth pass. The hour is late; tarrieth the Aunt for spite, Riseth the Lady—wisheth a good night. The Knight in bed ay Ay, always. thinketh on his host, Sleep hath he none, for wantonness of ghost. This bounteous Wedo gives her maids a call, Chusing the best and fairest of them all; Biddeth her go unto the Knight, and say, She comes to solace him till it is day; And that her Lady bids her say in bed, How much she wishes she was in her stead: Bot may not have the opportunity, Because, for spite, the Aunt with her doth lie. The maidin flies; her heart with gladness beats, Strippith, and creepith in between the sheets. Turnith the Knight unto the maidin gent, And both do pass the time with moch content— And aftir they have ragid to the full, Strokid the Knight, and givith Fotz a pull, And saieth, little Fotz, tellith me true, Be you aggriev'd with that I have done at you.— As I am a Christian Fotz, replied she, I nivir pass'd a night with so much glee.— Up sterts the Maidin, runnith in dismay Into the room next that her Lady lay, And finds her Lady up, and sitting there, Musing and pond'ring in an elbow-chair. Yon Knight, quoth she, 's a witch or something badder, He conjur'd hath the Devil in my bladder; After he did me twenty times and more, Oftner than ever I was done before, He pulleth Fotz, and of its own accord Spekid the mouth that nivir utters word.— Child, quoth the Lady, set your mind at ease, Most of us all have had the like disease, Working anights at soch a grievous rate Lozens the Fotz's tongue, and makes it prate. The Lady thinks to humour her is best, She deems her head is light for want of rest.— Yes, saies the Maid, they have tongis without doubt, I have seen Fotzes tongis hanging out. Go get to rest, replies the Lady bright, A little sleep will set your matters right. The Maidin goes, the Lady at the dore Harkneth, and stealeth to Sir Amadore; Sir Knight, quoth she, it is not very civil, To give my Maidin's Fotz unto the Devil: Fotz is no chamber for so mean a groom, He might have been content with a worse room. I use no fiend, quoth he, but have a skill To make what Fotz I please talk, when I will.— Talk! saies the Lady, I engage this ring, You neither make it talk, whyssel, nor sing.— Out flew the Knight, most terribly array'd; At sight whereof the Dame was nought afraid.— Upon the bed the Lady hath he pitch'd, And there she lay, as if she was bewitch'd: And after many pleasaunt fauncies there, Breethed the Knight awhile, to take the air; And whispering the Fotz, holding his nose, Biddith my Lady Fotz tell all she knows. Gapid the Fotz, and gabbill'd far and wide, Telling soch things, the Wedo swore she lied. I yield, saies she—you are a skilful youth; I yield, if you will stop that lyar's mouth.— 'Tis mighty well, saies he, we soon shall trie Whether my Lady Fotz has learnt to lie— And thrusting into Fotz's mouth a gag, Her next door neighbour's tong began to wag. Saies she, in a crack'd voice, like one you feign, All that Fotz sayth I am ready to maintain. Enough, the Lady saith, Sir Knight, have done, Here, take the ring, I own 'tis fairly won; And since you are a Knight of so great power, Freely I offer both myself and dower; And certes one was made for t'other's sake— For you can give no more than I can take. The fabul's finished, the King is hele Hele, whole recovered., The Damzill is contented yvery deal; And Grig had sons, and they had many heirs, And they were all like Grig, all free from cares; Their hearts would nivir sink no more than cork, And tho' no Kings, they still are Dukes of York. THE STUDENT OF LAW'S TALE; OR THE CURE FOR SYMPATHY. TALE VI. Sign of the Lamb, near Ludgate, you may find, The sign is emblem of the owner's mind. Emanuel Cooper dwelleth in that place, A Mercer, with an yvir smiling-face, Speking so soft, and pityfull, and meek, It seems he rather bleateth than doth speke; All pepil that do pass he humbly greets, Nay, when the wanton stops him in the streets, Though he doth most abhor the harlot's waies, That she will let him go, he softly praies; Although she holds him fast he will not swear, But, yvir-smiling, doth intreat her fair.— He hath heard his Onkil say there is ne vice He mote eschew like Harlotry and Dice; Harlots make men unfit to get an heir, And Dice consume all that the Harlots spare. This Onkil is a Scriv'nir in the Strond, Is rich, and lendeth money upon lond, A batchellor, and old, and dredeful sly, And trustith not to possibility: For he will see Emanuel have a son, Before he builds the house at Edmonton, With golden letters wrote upon the wall, Advising folk to name it Cooper-hall. The way Emanuel toke to get a wife Is subject of this Tale, and best of all his life. Emanuel hath near served out his years, Having ne vice at all the Onkil fears; Ne cause the Onkil hath to be afraid, Vice hath he none, but craftyness of trade. And now above a month his mastir's gone To drink the rede cow's milk at Yslington, And yvery day they loke for him to die Of a Consomption and the Lipprosie; And for that he doth trust Emanuel, He leaveth him alone to buy and sell. His Dame was brought up high, and knows not trade, To an Earl's Countess was she waiting-maid; Posys for rings contrives, and rhimes indites, And can discourse either with Squires or Knights, Having quaint terms and phrases to propound, Which those that dwell by Poul's cannot expound. But she hath long been very sick, and vows How she hath got the sickness of her spouse; Her Husband's kindred also do proclaim, How he hath got the sickness of the Dame; That she hath secret drogues, and but pretends To use the drogues her Husband's doctor sends: And so by following another course, She is grown better, and the Husband worse. His Doctor says, that she is whole and pure, And doubteth not that he hath done the cure: Her Spouse will not be cur'd, the Doctor sees, Because of complication of disease. Doctor and Isabell maintain it still, That Isabell was smit by Richard's ill; Richard rejoices she hath gained helth, Maketh his will, and leaveth her his welth. Isabell's eye hath notic'd many a time, Emanuel Cooper entering in his prime, And hath delighted, many a time, to see Soch perfect maiden-like simplicitie. One evening in her chamber she will sup, And bids the Maid to call Emanuel up; Bloshing, and hanging down his heade, he comes, Sitting him down, and loking at his thumbs.— Upon the bed by her she makes him sit, And helpeth him to yvery dainty bit; Come, saies the Dame, filling a cup quite up, Take off this wine, I will not bate a sup; Unto my Mastir's helth, quoth he, and drinks it dry; Lord, take his soul, saies she, and falls to cry, Name him no more, for it will break my heart, The Doctor saies, that he shall soon depart, And also saies, that when my Spouse is slain I shall not after him long time remain: By sympathy his malady I have, And sympathy shall join us in the grave: The remedy for sympathy is sure, But it is one I nivir will endure. Quoth then Emanuel, weeping as he spoke, Your case would pierce a heart, if it was oak; Bot if you slay the life that you may spare, It is a sin as dedely as despair. You speke devout, quoth she, but Heaven's a friend To all that mean no ill, when they offend. Quoth he, that is but sotelty Sotelty, Subtilty., I fear, For where the law is plain, the fault is clear; It is not written, that you shall not kill? Therefor the crime is both in deed and will. I do confess, quoth she, stroaking her ring, Deep is the judgement of your reasoning.— Besides, saies he, my Mastir may mend yet; With that at once she falls into a fit, Catches Emanuel by the hand, and saies, For mercy's sake, Emanuel, cut my staies. Emanuel takes a knife and cuts the string, And Isabell about his waist doth cling: Feel but my heart, saies she, how it doth beat, Put in your hand, Emanuel, farther, sweet. In sooth, quoth he, you are in piteous hap, The maid had best come up:—I'll give a rap. No, no, quoth she, I thank you for your love, Sit down upon the bed, you shall not move; Pity for me hath wrought in your distress, Another cup will cure your hevyness. The wine, to make it richer cordial, Mingled the Dame Cantharides withall; Emanuel drinks it up, the wine is choice, Wipeth his mouth, and cleareth up his voice: Madam, quoth he, if Heaven doth intend To take away my Mastir, and my friend, The bysness of the shop I'le undertake, Both for your own, and for my Mastir's sake. In that I am contented well, quoth she, Could I but take the Cure for Sympathy: It is a filthy cure—Emanuel, mark; You may suppose yourself to be the spark: Take a young spark, it says, and let him be A maid and modest, not past twenty-three:— From twenty-three shall he begin to count, And do the deed till he to thirty mount; And he must secret swear; and also both Shall bind their member with a fearfull oath, That neither he nor she shall find delite, But do the act as if it was for spite. Quoth then Emanuel, stiff as any stake, For now the wine hath made him quite awake, As to the maiden-term am not afraid; As Blessed Mary, am I very maid; I am but three and twenty yesterday; But for the oath I know not what to say; I am content myself it so should be, If that the members also will agree. That's in your power, saies she, there is no doubt, If you'll not think of what you are about; You must continue, when you are occupy'd, To think of any other thing beside, For instance; when you are arrived there, Keep thinking of a rabbit or a hare— And we need never feel, nor know no more Than doth the shuttle-cock and battle-dore; Without more words, this treaty shall have force, And all the rest are only forms of course. Leave we the parties interchangeably, To take the solemn oath, and ratify. They both went on, thinking and nothing saying, Till the last payment of the sum was paying; And then Emanuel cried out, I find I cannot keep the hare within my mind; When once you fall a spinning like a top, Rabbit and hare out of my mind do hop.— Go on, you fool, saies she, What makes you stop. The sum is paid, yet still in bed they lay; Her sympathy is not quite sweat away: Up stairs the maiden comes, raps at the dore, Shouting, my Mastir's dede for yvirmore; His man from Yslington doth say, below, That he went off as any child shall go. Shout not, the Dame replies, I understand, Holding Emanuel's handle in her hand: Run to the Undertaker of our street; I fear me Richard will not long keep sweet: I go, quoth she, Emanuel, this day, Too far for health to lose it in the way; And as it needs must be provoking pain To run this race of penitence again, And as—your three and twentieth year is out, It is but safe to take another bout: If this had been but a pretence or trick, She mote have pleaded false Arithmetick; But, as she fairly own'd the whole receipt, It's evident she had no design to cheat; And so Emanuel, after some pause, Mended the bill, and put in a new clause.— I will not paint the dismal funeral, The Wedo's lamentations tragical; Whoso delighteth to depicture woe Richly deserveth wretchedness allso: Yet can I not describe, without a sigh, The penalties that wait on perjury. Emanuel is foresworn; it is his doom To languish with one foot within the tomb: For three whole moons in raging pain he lay— The fourth the perjur'd limb is snatch'd away— Heaven is appeas'd at last, Emanuel sound, And for so small a loss glad to compound. What great Philosophers observe is true, Allthough a Member will not grow anew; Yet, notwithstanding this, the member brother Fares better for the absence of the other; For, when they go together in a pair, The next surviving brother is the heir; But if they're single, and the right not plain, The benefit devolves upon the brain; And thus Emanuel, having need of it, Receives a pritty legacy in wit: He gives the Potiker and Surgeon fee To keep the loss of Member secrecy. No longer to the Chainge Emanuel resorts, He is allwaies at the Stews and Inns of Courts; He drinks and beats the Watch, lies out anights, Living with Lawyers Clerks and wicked Wights.— In greatest grief is interval of ease; One day the Wedoe seizeth one of these, Calleth Emanuel, sheweth plain the case, How, from the lewdness of his last embrace, It happens that she is not healid quite— Trie to be more compos'd, saies she to-night. Compos'd! Emanuel saith, it cannot be; With you I needs must feel felicitie. To do an act like this from generous sense, Without desire, is true benevolence: Benevolence belongs to marry'd life; 'Tis what the Law bestows upon a Wife. Benevolence, for Lawyers various speak, Some say is once a month, some once a week; However, from the whole, it doth appear, One should not put it off beyond the year. I own there is another sentiment, That once in a whole life-time is sufficient. Benevolence, say these puzzlers and confounders, Is just the same as riding of the bounders. Emanuel, quoth she, I cannot guess, Whether your Modesty or Wit is less; Wit, in a Mercer, is both sin and shame; Return it to the stews, from whence it came.— I value, not, quoth he, your wipes a straw— I find great use in studying of the Law: And now observe—To all and singular, Emanuel Cooper hereby doth declare, By virtue of Recovery and Surrender, It is agreed between him and his Member, That he, the said Emanuel, shall direct, And, for the future, shew him no respect; And he, the said Emanuel, doth disclaim All further sinfull knowledge of his Dame, In any fashion, or in any place, At any time, or upon any case: Provided, and it is hereby agreed, If he and she to marrying accede, This shall by no means hinder the good man, Then and at all times, to perform the best he can.— This crafty Covenant between these twain, Hath made the Wedo think till thinking's vain; And finding now no hope on other score, Resolves at once, and doubteth nivir more— Calleth her friends, maketh for life the lease, And sleepeth with Emanuel in peace; And, to complete his and the Onkil's joy, Bringeth him once a year a curios boy; And now the Onkil's dead, and they have all And keep their Christenmas at Cowper-hall. PANTY'S The Rev. Mr. R. L. TALE; OR THE CAVALIER NUN. TALE VII. Novimus et qui te, transversa tuentibus hircis, Et quo sed faciles nymphæ risere sacello. Both high and low! simple and wise! Agree in making a great bustle, About a certain pair of eyes, Belonging to the House of Russell. Though not so awful and discreet, There was a pair of eyes at Brussels, Far more compassionately sweet, Than Lady Carolina Russell's Now Duchess of Marlborough.. Her eyes are like those swords of fire, The flaming swords to Angels given, By which impure and rash desire From the forbidden fruit are driven. Far other eyes are those I mean, I speak of an inviting pair, The property of frail eighteen, A Nun as amorous as fair. Impassion'd eyes, fit for a Nun; Eyes that Love lights and Venus shapes; Eyes like the gilding of the sun, Gilding ripe nectarines and grapes. The Lady Abbess was her Aunt; And, as they lay in the same cell, The Abbess was so complaisant, She pass'd her time exceeding well. She had the privilege alone Of running in the convent-ground, Surrounded by high walls of stone, Just like a filly in a pound. Within this close were shady trees, And there an Oratory stood; A Chapel of delight and ease, When folks delight in doing good. After her matines and her complines, Here she spent many pleasant hours; Instead of making cakes and dumplings, Purses and artificial flowers. 'Twas a delightful life she led, Here every day she met her monk, Unless he was confin'd in bed, Which was the case when he was drunk. One day within this Oratory, As she was with her Monk in chat, Instead of being solitary, And melancholy as a cat; Chatt'ring with many a lewd device, In which they neither were to seek, Tricks that Love teaches in a trice, Better than studying a week; In gibberish, and playful cant, Father, says she, pulling him down, I've a great mind to turn gallant, And give your Reverence a green gown: And, like my Aunt, I'll make you mad, As mad as King Nebuchadnazor, When she transforms you to a pad, As he was turn'd into a grazer. For all your stiffness and your pride, With whip and spur, I'll make you run; To which the humbled Monk reply'd, Spouse of the Lord, thy will be done. Her pad, as sturdy as a Miller's, She taught to rear, curvet, and prance, Make graceful caprioles, and dance, As if he was between the pillars. The Monk cry'd out, My Lady Abbess! My Lady Abbess! without cease, Your ways are ways of pleasantness, And all your paths are joy and peace. ARSINOE: OR, PASSION OVERSTRAINED. OLD HEWET'S This Gentleman was William Hewet, Esq. a sensible old Gentleman, but much of a humourist. He died in 1767, at the house of Vanini, in Florence. Being taken with a suppression of urine, he resolved, in imitation of Pomponius Atticus to take himself off by abstinence; and this resolution he executed like an ancient Roman. He saw company to the last—cracked his jokes—conversed freely—and entertained his guests with musick. On the third day of his fast he found himself entirely freed of his complaint; but refused taking sustenance. He said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was past, and he should be a cursed fool indeed to put about ship when he was just entering the harbour. In these sentiments he persisted without any marks of affectation; and thus finished his course with such ease and serenity as would have done honour to the firmest stoick of antiquity. Several anecdotes of this Gentleman are in Smollett's Expedition of Humphry Clinker, vol. II. p. 141. See also Hollis's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 324. TALE; TALE VIII. A celebrated humorist, well known in the great and little world, and all the world over. He was a great friend of the owner, and had a great love for Crazy Castle: the place, and the company he was sure to meet there, were perfectly sutied to his humour and turn of thinking. He died at Florence; and the following epitaph, which was made in his life-time, he ordered to be put upon his gravestone. It was wrote by one of his Italian companions, an abbaté, in Monkish Latin. EPITAPHTRANSLATED. COVER'D with turf, in a vile chest, Old Hewet lies amongst the dead, Just as well off as those that rest With piles of marble o'er their head, On Arno, Tiber, and the Rhone, To every Vettorino known. At Rome, in Roman manners vers'd, He walk'd with publicans and sinners, And churchmen keen, that hunger and thirst, For want of news and want of dinners.— In Turkey Hewet was a Turk: Like Aristippus or Saint Paul, He went the shortest way to work, And made himself all things to all. He could the traveller's hours beguile In Trac-Schuts creeping in the dark, Or dragg'd through sloughs of many a mile In tumbrils huge, like Noah's ark. On foot, as good with strollers strolling, As a machine to laugh and roll in. A guest delightful to the great, The great in virtue as in sin, And as well pleas'd, nor less a treat, At a gargotte or carrier's inn. Let not his friends therefore be griev'd; He's happy, that's enough to know, Sure to be always well receiv'd, Either above stairs or below. A welcome inmate, with his merits, Either to good or wicked spirits. It is not only love you'll find, You must not mind what poets say, All our strong passions are as blind, Our weakest scarce can see their way. A tale will tell you what I mean: Enter Arsinoe, the queen. Her favourite son, a puny chick, Once on a time was taken sick. Doctors were sent for into Greece, A humour seiz'd upon his bum, He might at least have died in peace, If these Greek Doctors had not come. After they had given him the question, With every kind of racking pain, After they had burnt and cut Hephestion, And burnt and cut him o'er again, At last the Doctors let him go, And left the Queen in frantic woe. Her eyes were fix'd, her talk was wild, Like Niobe, she stood amazed; She wonder'd death durst strike her child, And all her people thought her crazed. For she had seven sons beside; The worst of all was he that died. Ten thousand workmen were employ'd, For twenty years, I do suppose, To give his corpse a royal dwelling; Ten thousand oxen were destroy'd, Each day to feast her darling's nose, As all his pleasure lay in smelling. Her courtiers, to preserve their places, Forgot to shew their teeth and smile; They came with undertakers faces, And adulation new and vile. Just such a court, for cant and snivel, As when priest-ridden Lewis doated, Frighten'd with stories of the devil, Maintenon'd, be-petticoated, Married his nurse; and, what was worse, The devil always in his head, He durst not lie without his nurse, And always piss'd his nurse's bed.— Physic had done the worst it could; At length philosophy was brought; A Brachman cry'd, I have a thought May do your Majesty much good. The Queen afforded him her ear, And he proceeded as you'll hear.— The Gods, dispers'd through various nations, Were summon'd, by Jove's bounteous call; Beyond their hopes and expectations, The Gods were portion'd, great and small, With riches, power, the gift of healing, The art of war, and art of stealing; The scientific art of drinking, The art of music and of metre, The art of living without thinking, An art in my opinion sweeter; The art of pleasing, the completest, The art of love, by far the sweetest. Amongst the Gods assembled then, Dame Sorrow was not to be found; Sorrow was fretting in some den, Or lying sulky under ground. Whether or no he did not care, Or out of sight she slipp'd his mind, Sorrow got nothing for her share, In any shape, of any kind. At last, however, with her cries, She mov'd the ruler of the skies. Sorrow, said Jove, is always waking; You heard my summons, like the rest, Scarce any thing remains worth taking: I have dispos'd of all the best: And yet I think there are a few Choice rarities, will do for you. Now, as your ladyship loves whimpering, And has a mortal hate to Hebe, Euphrosyne, and wanton Phebe— Girls that love tittering and simpering— I give to you and your assigns All lamentations, sobs, and whines; Urns full of bones burnt to a coal; And, to refresh your grievous soul, As I am in a cue for giving, Pitchers of tears, both mild and stale, Bestow'd by people that are living On folks as dead as a door nail; And with each pitcher a full pot Of rich lachrymatory snot. And to these gifts so rare, so many, I give you tenderness in plenty, To be bestow'd like many a dainty, On those that have no need of any. Just as the pious Romans treat Their dead with plenty of nice food, Although they grudge them all they eat, As long as eating does them good; And after you have blown your nose, Said Jove, and are prepar'd for this, I give you dead men's eyes to close, And give you dead men's lips to kiss, And finally, all funeral rites, Wherever practis'd and profess'd, Whether perform'd by Blacks or Whites, With all the fooleries annex'd, Of which, continued the grave Don, I think the pyramid is one. Any great edifice of stone, Any great prison for the dead, But more especially the cone, And the rotund with a round head, Are fooleries; but the most clever Are pyramids, I'll tell you why; They are contriv'd to last for ever, Great fooleries that never die: And therefore none but Kings and Queens, The Powers above and Powers infernal, Can find materials, ways, and means, To make a foolery eternal. This pyramid's majestic gloom To sorrow properly belongs, With its funereal music-room, For dirges and sepulchral songs. Here Sorrow, and her handmaid Spleen, Shall be lock'd up, by my consent, And, in harmonious discontent, Dwell here, and never more be seen. Had not you plague enough in making it? Relinquish it, if you are wise, And thank her too for taking it; This is the best I can advise; For from that instant, be assur'd, Your sacred Majesty is cur'd. Pyramids, pitchers, pots, and urn, Plac'd in so comical a light, Gave the Queen's fancy a new turn, Brought her about, and set her right. The Queen began to taste repose, Then call'd for cards, and won at play: And then came joy, couleur de rose, And all the court again was gay. DON PRINGELLO'S TALE: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY NUNS; OR, THE MONK'S WISE JUDGEMENT. TALE IX. ?Detur potiori. Don Pringello was a celebrated Spanish Architect, of unbounded generosity; at his own expence, on the other side of the Pyrenean mountains, he built many noble castles, both for private people, and for the public. Out of his own funds, he repaired several palaces, situated upon the pleasant banks of that delightful river, the Garonne, in France; and came over on purpose to rebuild Crazy Castle; but, struck with its venerable remains, he could only be prevailed upon to add a few ornaments, suitable to the style and taste of the age it was built in. There is a noble town, call'd Ghent, A city famous for its wares, For Priests and Nuns, and Flanders mares, And for the best of fish in Lent. There you may see, threat'ning destruction, A hundred forts and strong redoubts, Just like Vauban's, with ins and outs, And cover'd-ways of love's construction. In one, constructed as above, There dwelt two Nuns of the same age, Join'd like two birds in the same cage, Both by necessity and love. In towns of idleness and sloth, Where the chief trade is tittle-tattle, Though Priests are commoner than cattle, They had but one between them both. Our Nuns should have had two at least, In Ghent they're common as great guns: Which made it hard upon our Nuns, And harder still upon the Priest. But he was worthy of all praise, With spreading shoulders and a chest, A leg, a chine, and all the rest, Like Hercules of the Farnese. Amongst the Nuns there was a notion, That these two Sisters were assign'd To him, for a severer kind Of penitential devotion. His penance lasted a whole year; And he had such a piece of work, If it had been for turning Turk, It could not have been more severe. Our Nuns, which is no common case, Living together without jangling, All on a sudden fell a wrangling About precedency and place. They both with spleen were like to burst, Like two proud Misses when they fight, At an Assembly, for the right Of being taken out the first. Before the Priest they made this clatter; Between them both he was perplex'd, And study'd to find out a Text, To end the controverted matter. Children, said he, scratching his sconce, I should be better pleas'd than you, Could I divide myself in two, And satisfy you both at once. Angels, perhaps, may have such powers; But it is fit and seasonable, That you should be more reasonable, Whilst you're with Beings such as ours. Be friends, and listen to the Teacher; Cease your vain clamour and dispute; Be ye like little fishes mute, Before Saint Anthony the Preacher. To end at once all disputation, I'll set my back against that gate, And there produce, erect and straight, The cause of all your altercation. But first you both shall hooded be, Both so effectually blinded, 'Twill be impossible to find it, Except by Chance or Sympathy. Which of you first, be it agreed, The rudder of the Church can seize, Like Peter's Vicar with his keys, Shall keep the helm, and have the lead; She shall go first, I mean to say, And have precedence every day. The Nuns were tickled with the jest, They were content; and he contriv'd To give the helm, for which they striv'd, To her that manag'd it the best. THE POET'S TALE; OR THE CAUTIOUS BRIDE. TALE X. Brides, in all countries, have been reckon'd, For the first night, timid and coolish; If they continue so the second They always have been reckon'd foolish: The reason's obvious and plain— In many nice and ticklish cases, There's much to lose, and nought to gain, By affectation and grimaces. A Bridegroom, on the second night, Whipt off the bedcloaths in surprize: Behold, my dear, said he, a sight, Enough to make your choler rise. She turn'd away as red as scarlet, Whilst he continu'd, Pray behold; Lay hands on that outrageous varlet, That looks so impudent and bold. This is the fifteenth time, in vain, He has been sent to jail and fetter'd; But there's no prison can contain A prison-breaker like Jack Shepherd. The Bride turn'd round, and took her place, After some studying and thinking— Said she, recovering her face, Though modesty still kept her winking: In vain the vagabond's committed, And to hard work and labour sent, If you, his keeper, are outwitted By his pretending to repent. You treat him ruggedly and hard, Whilst any insolence appears, But you're disarm'd, and off your guard, The moment that he falls in tears. Now you must know, that I suspect A fellow-feeling, in some shape, Or else you would not, through neglect, Let him continually escape. I'll lend no hand, unless you'll swear, That you'll deliver him to me, And suffer me to keep him there, Till I consent to set him free. THE GOVERNOR OF T??LBURY'S TALE; OR THE UNREASONABLE COMPLAINT. TALE XI. A brute, a Peasant, dwelt near Nantz, For they're synonymous in France, Who every day of his vile life, When he had nothing else to do, Thrash'd or apply'd his wooden shoe To the posteriors of his wife. But, as all good and evil's equal, All was balanc'd in the sequel; Every night he had that pride, His debit, on the whole amount Of the posterior account, Was balanc'd by the other side. Like debts of honour lost at play, Before he slept, he was sure to pay. And every morn before he rose, He left her, over and above, A token of his constant love, Steady and constant as his blows. One morning, at his Spouse's levee, The blows and curses fell so heavy, Before the Lady of the place, Poor Jaquette ran with her complaint, With all the red and purple paint Bestow'd upon her nose and face. The Lady pity'd her just grief, And took a course for her relief; Pierre was summon'd to appear, And must have rotted in a jail, Had he not found sufficient bail, For his behaviour for a year. The dread of fines, a jail, and whipping, Like other folks, kept him from tripping. About a month after this pass'd, For Jaquette the good Lady sent, And ask'd her if she was content, And Pierre peaceable at last. Truly, says she, I must confess, That mine's a singular distress; For though he beat me black and blue, At night he always made it up, In bed, over a chearful cup, Where I was as content as you. But now, he says, he's off his mettle, Because we've no accounts to settle. Let him indulge his appetite, This very day let him begin A fresh account, upon my skin, And settle it this very night. After such plenty of good fare, To be reduc'd is hard to bear. What then, my Lady, must I feel, Depriv'd entirely of my meat, Without a morsel left to eat, Except what I can beg or steal? The Lady cry'd, You'd make one think, That you did nought but eat and drink. Did you live always at this pass, Or now and then, and then it ceas'd, Like Shrovetide, or a village feast, Or like a Bishop's saying Mass? A tear stood trembling in her eye, Whilst Jaquette made her this reply: He was as sure as the Church Chimes! And I can say, what few can say, He allow'd me three warm meals a day, And afternoonings too sometimes. 'Twas not from indigestion, That never was the question; If now and then my fare was worse, It was because, the day before, He happen'd to allow me more Than was convenient for his purse. The Lady cry'd, Submit in quiet; My Spouse all day shall thrash his fill, I'll never say that I'm us'd ill, If he'll allow me such a diet. THE NOBLE REVENGE: OR, THE L??B'S TALE. TALE XII. All people, languages, and nations, In summer-time, have country stations, And have contrivances and ways, Some very old and others new, To get the better of long days, Which are the hardest to subdue. In Italy the morning passes In visiting and hearing masses; And every creature, after dinner, Retire, in couples or alone; Both male and female, saint and sinner, Strip themselves naked as a stone. All the world's out when night approaches, A-foot, in curricles, and coaches; Then they give concerts and act plays, And sup at one another's houses: The Wives go with their Chechisbays, Their Mates with other people's Spouses. In France, and probably in Spain, Summer gets on with toil and pain; The Ladies sally, with long canes, To gather flowers, or pick a sallet, Attended by fantastic swains, Like Figure-dancers in a ballet. Some stay within and do much better; Some only stay to write a letter; Others into the garden run, To bowl, or shoot with bows and arrows; Strephon, with Chloe and a gun, Makes love, and fires among the sparrows; Kills all the tenants of the grove, But let those live that only live to love. Pray, how do English Summers go? They pass their Summers but so so; More like the Germans than the French, Drinking as long as they are able, And never thinking of a wench, Till all the liquor's off the table: But when they give their mind that way, No people more alert than they. Venus is cruelly afraid, Bacchus encroaches there so much, Lest he should spoil the Cyprian trade, As Plutus spoils it with the Dutch. One summer, in the month of June, My Lady was quite out of tune; To set things right, she and my Lord Repair to the old country-seat, Which to enjoy, with one accord, They lie apart, and seldom meet. They neither need to mope alone, Each have companions of their own; His are the worst, without all question, Led-Captains, Squires, and Parsons, without end; Hers, females of a strong digestion, Mingotti and her Fiddling Friend.— But then my Lord had a resource, Which made things equaller of course: There is a place his Lordship chuses, I know not upon what pretence, To call the Temple of the Muses, Built with less judgement than expence. To push on time a little faster, My Lord appointing a toast-master, Oft to the Temple's sacred shade Retires, like Numa to his charmer, To meet some favourite Chamber-maid, Or the fair Daughter of some farmer. One afternoon a spy reveal'd The secrets that those walls conceal'd.— When my Lord was inclin'd to take it, There was a room for making tea, My Lady's woman us'd to make it, And always us'd to keep the key. He had left off tea some time; but why, Abigail was resolv'd to spy. Within the room she made, or found, A hole to peep into the next; Her labour with success was crown'd, Though the discovery made her vex'd. He left off tea, you may infer, Because he was tir'd to death of her. She saw, as plain as eyes could see, And never saw him half so keen, My Lord as busy as a bee, Sipping the sweets of sweet Eighteen. To be discarded and turn'd off, Of every servant-wench the scoff! For whom? The Wife of a mean Taylor: Such was the Nymph in the Muses house; She look'd as if she could impale her, Even as a Taylor would a louse. My Lord return'd, sated with glory, And Betty ran to tell her story— Says she, Your Ladyship's so kind, My zeal for you made me suspicious; I watch'd; but never thought to find Any thing downright flagitious. Against mankind she declaim'd next, And then stuck closely to her text; Minutely painted the whole scene, The Nymph, her age, her lovely figure; And, to increase her Lady's spleen, She magnify'd his Lordship's vigour. Great was her Ladyship's distress, How she would act, is hard to guess. All folks allow revenge is sweet, And many think that nothing's sweeter; But 'tis a maxim with the Great, The meaner the Revenge the greater Caprice, according to Fontaine, Guides almost every female brain; If mere caprice can raise a flame, To make a Dwarf enjoy a Queen, Revenge may make the noblest Dame Employ an instrument as mean. Nature, left to herself, most prone is, To follow the Lex talionis, In every nice and doubtful case. My Lady drove as nature led; And so she took, in my Lord's place, Her rival's Husband to her bed. A Taylor's nothing on his board, In bed he's better than a Lord, Her Ladyship found him so there; And by his help, after ten years, At last produc'd a Son and Heir, That made my Lord the happiest of Peers. TO THE LADIES. Ladies, you have heard of Tit for Tat— Lex Talionis was like that: It was an equitable law, whereby You weigh'd the person and the failure; It gave you tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, And for a Lord, sometimes a Taylor. THOMAS OF COLEBY'S TALE. PORCIA, OR PASSION OVERACTED. We come too late, car tout est dit, Says La Bruyere; and more fool he: Not only every age, each year Brings scenes unknown before to view, New realms of fancy still appear, And beyond them regions still new. Voltaire, and others I can mention, Will give a colour and fresh look, A lively varnish, like invention, To any tale in any book; And sell you one, ten times repeated, Like an old watch in a new case, Or an old drab, with whom you're cheated, Taking her home for a new face. Dress'd by the Graces and Fontaine, In a coquetish deshabille, Without her weeds and Roman train Told by Petronius Arbiter. The Ephesian matron pleases still. And Porcia too, whose tale I tell, Adorn'd by them, had pleas'd as well. Porcia could never be consol'd For the departure of her spouse; A fever, caught by catching cold, Had cancell'd their connubial vows. Of every comfort now bereft, The wretch's comfort, and the curse, Was all the comfort she had left— That is, Fate could not use her worse: Her grief was settled, like her dower, For life, and out of fortune's power. To lay her grief up safe and sound, Where sorrow might have elbow-room, No place above, or under ground, Was fitter than her husband's tomb, Than that deep cave, I should have said, That held the tomb wherein he laid; With vaulted roof lofty and wide, Where every sigh and plaintive moan Were play'd about from side to side, Or whisper'd in the sweetest tone. There with his tomb she found, in brief, All the whole equipage of woe, And every utensil of grief, Both for convenience and show. A lamp on each side of his urn, Of vases lachrymal a dish, A stone to sit upon and mourn, As cold as broken-heart could wish: And on his urn engrav'd there were A torch revers'd, to shew her loss, Death's head, and with Death's head a pair Of marrow-bones were laid across: As good, though only made of stone, For grief to pick, as real bone. Whether the day was fair or foul, Most of it pass'd within this cell: A solemn solo from the owl, At night was Porcia's warning-bell; Warn'd from the mansions of the dead, To water with fresh tears her bed, Nature, alarm'd for Porcia's sake, Took her into her special keeping; The harm she did herself awake, Nature repair'd when she was sleeping. Porcia, refresh'd by balmy sleep, Rose every morning like the sun, Emerging vigorous from the deep, Prepar'd his daily course to run. One afternoon, the month was May, Porcia had din'd in her poor way. A cavalier rode gently by, As she was going upon duty, And with a critic's curious eye Survey'd this melancholy beauty. Her hair in careless ringlets spread, Two large black eyes to suit her hair, The graceful posture of her head, Smooth, white, round breasts a strutting pair, With rosy buttons budding sweet, That correspond but never meet. A shape, a hand, delicious arms, An outline elegantly drawn, Were ample sureties for the charms Hid by reluctant crape and lawn. Such an assortment of rich wares, With so much art and taste dasplay'd, Such tempting baits and cunning snares, Concupiscence had seldom laid. Our horseman first survey'd his ground; That done, he was dismounted soon, Not like a trooper by a wound, But like an active brave dragoon. So have I seen, in the same guise, A 'squire drawn in by two arch eyes: For lo, the 'squire, dismounting strait, First argues with himself awhile, Then hangs his horse upon a gate, Then follows Phebe o'er a stile. Porcia meanwhile, on her stone seat, Lamenting sat, warm as a toast: Nothing but Porcia's natural heat Could have maintain'd so cold a post; For Nature, as I said before, Had ammunition always near, And fresh recruits for evermore, To pour into her front and rear. And now appear'd, in sad array, Clodio, the hero of the play. Entering the vault with downcast eyes, He threw himself upon the ground, Whilst Porcia's cadenc'd moans and sighs Gently reverberated round. Porcia's melodious complaints Were like the music of the spheres, Delightful music for the saints, But none at all for Clodio's ears. He seem'd quite lost in deep despair, Or so absorb'd in mental visions, He heard them not, or did not care For all her quavers and divisions. On the cold stones reclining laid, At length with woe-struck voice he said, See, Anna, where thy Clodio lies, For ever faithful to his vows, Pouring his annual sacrifice Upon the grave of his lov'd spouse. Disdain not, in the realms above, The tears of consecrated love!— Sitting unnotic'd and neglected, Eve's curiosity or pique, A pique one scarce could have suspected, Prompted the dowager to speak. The case was delicate and nice; She took her chance, and broke the ice. Welcome, poor wretch, to this abode, This house of death, continued she; This passage is the only road To peace and rest for thee and me. Then ty'd her speech up with a sigh, Waiting for Clodio's reply. Oh let me hear that voice again! Is it a real voice, he cry'd, Or an illusion of the brain? Real, alas! the voice reply'd. Rous'd by the voice's awful sound, At once he started from the ground, Like Garrick, riveting his eyes On Porcia, with a frantic glare! Porcia play'd Juliet's surprise, With Bellamy's surprising stare. No painter's art could have devis'd Two figures that seem'd more surpris'd. But what was more surprising, clearly, She on her stone, he on his feet, Mistook each other very queerly, Struck by a similar conceit: Each saw their spouse, in either figure, Restor'd to life, in perfect vigour. Some time was spent in contemplation, Previous to any declaration. When their confusion was abated, And things seem'd ripe for a debate, Preliminary forms were stated, Relative to their present state; And at the last from their confusion They drew a very fair conclusion: It follow'd, from the first impression Made upon both at the first glance, That such a lively just expression Could never be the work of chance: Two forms, so truly represented, Could not by chance have been presented. If 'twas not chance, what then remain'd? Why this conclusion must remain, If 'twas not chance, 'twas pre-ordain'd; Nothing in nature was so plain; Both pre-ordain'd, by special grace, Their mutual losses to replace. This point, discuss'd on Porcia's stone, Was fairly stated, as you'll see, And as this stone could hold but one, The Widow sat on Clodio's knee; This was a necessary case, For otherwise, my worthy Sirs, If Porcia had not chang'd her place. Clodio must have sat on her's. None but a prude, I do suppose, Can blame th' alternative she chose. If the resemblances could reach To every article throughout, The representative of each Could entertain no further doubt; But doubts must needs be entertain'd, Till every doubtful point's explain'd: For likenesses are oft deceiving, Appearances are often cheating; Seeing is not a firm believing; The pudding's proof is in the eating: In that case, all you have to do Is to say grace, and then fall to. Having no subject for debate, Wanting no proof but that alone, They sign'd the treaty drawn by fate, And seal'd it upon Porcia's stone. And thus the doubtful points compar'd, Handled and view'd in every light, All correspondently declar'd The previous conclusion right. And so the long-predestin'd pair, Clodio and his deputed wife, Leaving the monumental chair, Rose from the dead to a new life; For having now, as it grew late, No further business with the dead, They finish'd the decrees of fate, At Porcia's house, in Porcia's bed; But Porcia first prepar'd the way With a good supper and Tokay. Clodio next morning, not before, Talking of Anne, and his affliction, Own'd his wife Anne, and, what was more, Own'd the whole process was a fiction; He had no wife alive or dead, The representative of Anne Had put that thought out of his head, And help'd him to a better plan. But grant, said he, we both were cheats, And that your grief, like mine, was feign'd, Our meeting here between two sheets Might for all that be pre-ordain'd: A field where you may range and feast, Unty'd, not tether'd like a beast. MORAL TALES. A CHRISTMAS NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT. BY LADY ???????. First printed in 1783. MY LADY'S TALE. TALE I. Rash, poor, and ever in a hurry, Till he was far advanc'd in age, A certain General like ??????, At last grew cautious, rich, and sage: With all the subsidies of life, All but an heir and a young lively wife; Young she must be, for reasons good, Not to excite passionate dealings, To keep him warm with her warm blood, And to indulge his sober feelings: The wife he got, he left the care To Providence and her, to make his heir. At first a blaze, or two at most Appear'd, just like a fire of stubble, That cannot either bake or roast, Or broil, or make the kettle bubble: But seldom, after that auspicious day, The noble General fired, except in play. One night he gave a false alarm, Which she most patiently endur'd; “I thank my stars there is no harm!” She whisper'd to herself, insur'd Metaphor taken from a policy of insurance against fire, for a trifling consideration.. Howe'er, to cover his disgrace, She let him keep manœuvring round the place. His nightly fondling and stroking, She bore with resignation meek; When he became downright provoking, She made him quiet for a week. It was not oft, you understand, That she was forc'd to take the task in hand. Tir'd of his motions and parading, To drop all metaphors of war, She made him stick to serenading, To twang and finger her guitar, Like a child's fiddle, to divert young chicks, From clamb'ring up and playing naughty tricks By independence held out to his dear, By a sincere emancipation, He gain'd, like Fox, peace and good cheer, Besides a helping hand upon occasion: As to their love, content with these concessions They left their jewels to their own discretions. The General thus address'd the Fair, Tossing and tumbling in her nest: “Get me a Deputy—indeed a pair, For fear of accidents, is best: But first, consult your wise, experienc'd dam, Trust her judicious eye, my tender lamb.” He might have spar'd his curtain lecture, His tender lamb, for all her youth, Was never guided by conjecture, Or mere appearances of truth: Neither consenting nor denying, She took no measures without trying. So by repeated trials, in the end, And wisely taking nought for granted, She found the steady friend, And Deputy, the General wanted. In fine, without more fuss or teasing, She made her choice, and chose discreetly: The stream of time, flow'd smooth and pleasing, Not only pleasingly, but sweetly; So much, that the whole veteran corps Envied the General more and more. Replete with gratitude, the dame, Yielded to all his weakest fancies; And by a blush of simpering shame, Vouch'd for his feats, and conjugal romances. All which, as I before related, Made the old General envied, if not hated. Young folks are apt, in many a case, Left to themselves, without a warden, To disregard both time and place, Like Eve and Adam in the garden. They take a turn, they look about, And, seeing nought to fear, conceive no doubt: Taking their pastime in an arbour, Our friends were by the Chaplain spied, Like frigates riding in an arbour, With their sails furled, in naked pride: The Priest, like Satan, sigh'd, and saw with spite Adam and Eve in primitive delight. Before they reach'd the bower of bliss, At the first glance, you may suppose, Down dropt the Priest, squat like a Miss, Stepping aside to pluck a rose. Cowering he watch'd, amidst the shrubs hard by An envious toad, like Milton's wicked spy. When the scene clos'd the spy withdrew, With marks of grief and indignation, Revealing every thing he knew, Relating to the incarnation. “Lock'd in each other's arms they play'd, Fasten'd and glew'd from head to foot, The pair conjoined, you would have said, Were grown together like a double nut. Their springs and movements equal and exact, As if they were but one in fact.” The General smil'd, and heard the Doctor's tattle, Calm and serene, as in a field of battle. “'Twas a fine sight, I envy you the pleasure; I know, said he, your hate to blabs and praters, And am rejoic'd and happy beyond measure, That none but God and you were the spectators. Depend upon't, she shall be told, When she's disposed to go so light and thin; To run no more such risks of catching cold, But take her exercise within. I love my wife, I feel her merits, I am her doctor, and advise, For her hystericks, and low spirits, This brisk de-obstruent exercise. A hundred pounds a year I pay her squire, I feed him sumptuously, and therewithal The labourer is worthy of his hire, And always ready at a call. Know you, the General said to the Divine, A General's lady better off than mine?” The priest replied, and answer'd well, “Sir, if I knew, I would not tell. I could name one, one every way As capable as brisk and stout, A much more proper Cicesbi Either within doors, or without; And one he said, cocking his thumb, That would have done the job for half the sum.” THE MORAL. BY THE DRAMATIST. All tales and fables, long or short, Æsop's or Homer's, feign'd or true, Must have a Moral of some sort, For our instruction, says Bossu. We learn this truth from Homer's songs, When youth and insolence conspire, Grievous dissensions and great wrongs Arise from passion, set on fire. His tale is founded upon anger, With anger's terrible effects; This upon impotence and langour, With age's visible defects. They both agree in one conclusion, Where there's no harmony all is confusion; In states, in senates, camps and fleets, And now and then in wedding sheets. If an old fellow goes to bed With his young bride, and gets next morn, Instead of his bride's maidenhead, The maiden-bride's contempt and scorn; The surest way to set things right, And to do justice to the bride, Is to get up and take his flight, Or take her General for his guide: Who sail'd through time with a fine breeze, Through pleasant days and nights of ease: For the connubial clog and yoke, Heavy to me, not light to you, To him was a mere joke, Easy it sat like an old shoe. THE PARSON'S WIFE. TALE II. Sue, and another country lass, With ploughman Dick, a gibing knave, Were at the wedding of an Ass, And all of them look'd very grave. The marriage ceremony done, The lasses cried, “Dick, shew your skill, If you are for a bit of fun, Chuse one of us, take which you will.” Richard maliciously reply'd, Thinking to disconcert the jades, “Faith! I would rather take the bride, If I might chuse, than her bride-maids.” “I do believe you, Dick,” said Sue, And jogg'd her partner, with a grin: “We wou'd take Jack rather than you, If 'twas not for the sin.” MORAL. This is not an immoral Tale, The Parson, to his praise and glory, Exhibited over his ale, A Moral to his spouse's story. If Moses had not been so clear And circumstantial in God's orders, The carnal appetites, I fear, Would often get beyond the borders; There would be many a strange wedding, Some without either bed or bedding. If the Divine Legation had not shewn it, How should unletter'd people know, Whether it was a sin or no? Even Warburton would not have known it. And therefore, as I said above, Moses was told to teach the Jews, How and with whom they might make love: God would not let them pick and chuse. His chosen people all their lives, Lov'd novelties, as they do now; God knew that they would leave their wives At any time to kiss a cow. The Jewish ladies were like our's, Fickle, not nice in their amours; And if it had not been forbid, Many might have been got with kid. THE PARSON'S TALE; SEEING IS BELIEVING. TALE III. Thomas came running to the mill, As Will was standing at the door, “Would you believe it, neighbour Will?” Said Tom, “my wife's an arrant whore! With colours flying, drums a pair, I left her very hard at work, Tossing the Squire up in the air, As if he had been made of cork. You know the burthen is not light, He was not born to be a jockey, And, to add something to the weight, His worship was a little rocky. From my relation I presume, Neighbour, you will conclude and gather, That he was in a plaguy fume, And she all over in a lather. I never thought, as I'm a sinner, That Moll had any sporting blood, Or any kind of mettle in her, No more than in a log of wood. At any moment of the day, My wife said, Will takes as much pains: I make her pockets ring and play, Jingling her keys about like chains. And yet no sempstress with a thimble, That sits all day upon her crupper, Can be more mettlesome and nimble, Or readier for it, after supper.” “Where did you leave your wife?” said he— “Behind yon stack, where she lies dry. Run and peep through the hedge and see,” Said Tom, “if she begin to fly.” Will ran and peep'd, and then crept nigher, And then cried, “Thomas, you're a liar. I see them at it, and see clear, 'Tis not your Moll, but my sweet Nell; The devil, I hope, that brought her here, Will carry her back with him to hell.” “I knew, and would have laid my life,” Said Will, “if I had bid you go, To see the pastime of your wife, You would not run to see the show; But you would scamper to the stack, To see my wife upon her back. The only way that I would act, The only way I would advise, And the best way to prove the fact, Is to appeal to your own eyes.” MORAL. Segnius irritant animos dimissa per aurem, Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quæ Ipse sibi tradit spectator.— An offer from one, of one seventy-four, Was grateful to the royal hearing, If one by self one had offer'd one more, Keppel would think that one was jeering. “The offer might surprize a tar,” The Lawyer cried, taking off Lee: “To see the L?r man of war, I do confess would surprize me.”— “There is some difference,” said the scoffer, “Between an offering and an offer; Sam offer'd Jack a horse—‘where is he, Sam? Sam answer'd—‘in the matrix of his dam.’ ‘Where are my ships,’ cried Lewis, ‘seize, That many a town and province offers?’ ‘Sire,’ said the daughter of Therese, ‘Breeding, like Spider's eggs, in empty coffers.” THE ASSOCIATION. THE SQUIRE'S TALE. TALE IV. A village Burgher was Ralph Crop, A Grocer without guile or malice; The master of the grocer's shop, And of Ralph Crop, was Mistress Alice. When Alice was engaged, her damsel Kate, When Ralph her spouse was absent too, Did quite as well, for she could sell and prate, Better, perhaps, than Crop could do. Crop was just gone to the market-town, And all the world was there—'twas the Fair-day— To buy his wife a cap and gown, To shew his taste, and make her shew away. All the world knows, that certain glances Interpret certain women's fancies. The Exciseman was a fine observer, And saw from Alice's black eyes, That all the world could not preserve her From being taken by surprise. Treading the shop, he cast the dye, He pass'd the Rubicon, and met her; And in the twinkling of an eye, Carried his point, and overset her. He pass'd the Rubicon, it means in verse, He was not bashful for her looking fierce: At the first onset, Myles averr'd, He took the Lion by the beard. For Hercules, without a scratch or rub, Taking possession of that feature, With his great club, Terrified and subdued the creature. Myles having conquer'd her disdain (Alice and Myles were in their prime) They did not spend their hours in vain, But made the properest use of time. Ralph was returning with her fairing, And at the door, just after pairing. Neither suspecting any harm, Behold, Crop enters with his riches, A gown and cap under his arm, As Myles was pulling up his breeches.— “I am glad you left the fair so soon,” His wife cried out—“the Exciseman there, Whipt in just now, this afternoon, Stark staring mad as a March hare. Had he not known you by your blowing, Had not he heard you at the door, That very moment he was going To s?t upon the parlour floor; And swore, that if I call'd or stir'd, The brute would make me eat his—merde.” “What did you mean,” said Crop, “by this?” “Nothing at all,” said Myles, “amiss.” Behold, said one, that shall be nameless, Before her window, Mistress Blameless; Poor soul, she looks quite melancholy. Try, Myles, some heads were made for horns. To try, said I, would be a monstrous folly, Try to lick honey off the thorns; Even suppose what cannot be supposed, I would not wrong a friend, so well disposed; I'll put as hard a case, I think, A rump and dozen—let us wager, I'll make no love, but make a stink, Shall cure her vapours, I'll engage her. Mind; I'll untruss down to the feet, And do my n?s before her face, Plump on the floor; and for my treat, She shall be thankful and say grace. If you had not stept in between, I should have won the wager clean, Nothing amiss was meant, I knew, My friend here lov'd a harmless joke; The thought was comical and new, 'Twould make him laugh ready to choak.” “Marry come up, my dirty Cousin,” Said Alice, “with your rump and dozen; Laugh! laugh at what, you filthy beast? If he had laugh'd at such a thing, I would have made both his ears ring For one whole fortnight at the least. Go, pay the wager you have lost;” “I'm glad,” said Crop, “that he was taken in, A rump and dozen's no small cost, And as to laughing, let them laugh that win.” MORAL. “A case in point,” said sly Sir John, “To prove two heads better than one. One gives a hint, and only moves it, The second takes it, and improves it.” “I grant your maxim,” said his Dame, “If both their interests are the same.” The Baron cried, “the Moral's fine, I smoke two rogues, and one design. I see two rogues together pull, Two patriots set out together, In dirty roads and in foul weather, To make a fool of poor John Bull.” HOB IN THE WELL. SIR JOHN'S TALE. TALE V. A taylor, bodkin-stitch, in a few years Grew rich, and is increasing still, By the nice conduct of his sheers, And skill in drawing up a bill. A bill, like any bill of Chancery, Or my Lord North's bill of Fine—ansery— His Budget like a giblet pie, Furnish'd with gizzards, hearts and liver, Pinions, necks, feet, and blood for ever, And Goose-cap heads, that once look'd high. Twelve miles from York, or thereabout, Stitch bought a farm, he call'd Surtout— His agent, every week that came, Was sure to send him a stout hare, Pigeons, and now and then some game, With rabbits, taken in a snare. In fine, Stitch liv'd like any Lord, Any Lord Mayor that draws long corks— Turkeys and geese smok'd on his board, Like geese upon his board of works. Besides, his farm produc'd him clear In cash two hundred pounds a year. Robin, a Farmer, was his factor, The Taylor would not part with Hob, So good a factor and transactor, For the best regimental job; Not to take measure of the King, Although, perhaps, by such an honour, His wife, a proud disdainful thing, Might not take quite so much upon her: A Knight's third cousin, where's the wonder If Bodkin truckl'd and knock'd under; Observe, that every Easter Sunday Hob came to feast on paschal lamb, And then return'd on Easter Monday To tansy pudding and a ham. The beds were full, when Robin came— As harmless as his namesake bird, Robin was forc'd to make a third, And pig with Bodkin and his Dame. Hob in his breeches went to bed, And Mistress Stitch was in the middle, Her face turn'd close to Bodkin's head, To leather-breeches her bum-fiddle. Bodkin's horn soon began to blow, Hob was awake, and she also. On certain signals from behind, Hob his mask'd battery disclos'd, Summon'd the fort, which was resign'd Upon the terms that he propos'd. They were oblig'd to take their leave, At least for fear of a surprize, Not without tears, you may believe, And sleep in earnest clos'd their eyes. Recruited with a few hours nap, Hob gave her notice of his rising, First at the door he gave a tap, And then a rap that was surprizing: As Madam Stitch in the conclusion Receiv'd the coup-de-grace and was expiring, Bodkin was wak'd by a contusion, Studied the point and could not help admiring; And then put back his hand, and lo! He found Hob in the well below. “Steal off,” said Stich, “and quit your ground, 'Tis well for you she sleeps so sound. If my wife wakes and finds you got Out of your road into her quarters, She'll scratch your eyes out, she's so hot, And strangle you in her Bath garters.” “When I got there,” said Hob, “or how, I know no more than you, I vow; But in the well have got, through thick and thin— Oft in my sleep I walk, they say, And in my sleep must have walk'd in, Said Hob, that must have been the way.” Hob vanish'd—Mistress Stitch soon after Furnish'd another scene for laughter; She jogg'd her Spouse, and whisper'd low, “Is Robin up and gone, or no?” Bodkin replied, “At break of day— Two hours ago he stole away.” “I dreamt,” said she, and then awoke, I thought 'twas you in such a cue, I doubted whether it was you; I thought you drove away like smoke: I never felt so much delight, Either in sleeping or awake— I was afraid 'twas some mistake: What would I give to dream it every night! I was surpriz'd to find you grown So lusty, and with so much bone, And twice as strong, and stronger too, Than when upon our wedding sheets, For all that I could say or do, You robb'd me of my virgin sweets.” “'Twas but a dream,” said Stitch, “that's plain, I'll try to make you dream again;” He did his best, and Morpheus seiz'd her soon, Bodkin got up at nine; she slept till noon.— MORAL. “The sex,” said a physician of the college, “Like men, are either saints or sinners, Like Eve, they long so much for knowledge, They scarce have time to eat their dinners.” The difference between them and us Is this, the sex, both great and small, All look as innocent as puss, The greatest hypocrite of all. But men oft glory in their shame, And take our wives for lawful game. Put not your trust in leather breeches, Whether your wife's behind you, or before, They all can tell, they are such witches, Whether you sleep, or only feign a snore. She knows her time, she gives an intimation To Galligaskins; and, if he's inclined, He will accept of madam's invitation, Just as it suits, before you or behind. THE DAINTY WIDOW'S TALE. TALE VI. My Tale is every bit a Moral, A hint for delicate complexions, Black, brown, and fair, or red as coral, May benefit by my reflections. In artifice, most of us deal; And ladies, that affect fine feelings, Mean to declare how fine they feel, All over in their tender dealings. “Reach me that peach,” said I, “my dear, It sets my teeth on edge,” said Prue, “It makes me feel all over queer, Has it not that effect on you?” “Your teeth on edge, my dear! I understand— I would not give the creature any quarter; When you have got Eve's fruit into your hand, Miss, I suppose,” said I, “your mouth must water.” Prue redden'd, not from shame, but spite; “I see,” said I, “my guess is right.” THE BARONESS'S TALE. TALE VII. A merry story's better far, Than a lampoon or witty libel! Mine is from Margaret of Navarre, As true as any in the Bible. Vraie comme l'Evangile, “'tis e'en, True as the gospel,” says the queen. “Three Merchants of Savoy, I know not when, Were travelling, each with his spouse, Pilgrims to Saint Antonio of Vienne, All of them bound by previous vows, In journeying to live together, Not like their fathers and their mothers, But like three sisters, and three brothers, As well in cold as in hot weather. Like them in beds apart to lie, In chambers separate, but nigh. Lest through mistake, sister and brother, Or in their sleep, or in the dark, Might tumble one upon another, And the collision strike a spark; Which meeting with the tinder box, Is all that they require; All such combustibles as smocks, To make the least inflammable catch fire. They were all left in full possession Of every other sense or taste, That is, to use them with discretion, You know there's none below the waist. At Chambery arriving, our three pair Spared no expence at their hotel, Excellent wine and plenty of good fare, All appetites but one fared well. They supp'd, and seem'd so loath to part; The brothers and the sisters both, I am persuaded from my heart, Had much ado to keep their oath. The ladies to their room repair'd, To chat both in and out of bed; Their beds before had been prepar'd, Three with one pillow for each head. But were their husbands there, and thereabout, Instead of one, Had there been none, I do believe they could have done without. I need not tell you, when three Dames, Gather'd together, are undressing, They call things by their naked names, So plain, they leave no room for guessing: When the discourse is turn'd from fashions, To certain objects of the passions: And in undressing you may swear, They shew their charms, and they compare.— Three Monks, all three Father Confessors, That lay hard-by, wonder'd to hear, The ladies talking like professors, In terms of art, distinct and clear: Which made the holy fathers rise, And stand and listen with surprize. Then gliding to the door they spy'd, Up, on their beds, all in their shifts, The three fair Dames that scorn'd to hide Any of God's bounteous gifts, The Monks much edify'd retir'd, And by Saint Francis were inspir'd. They knew they lay without a mate; And like brave soldiers of Saint Francis, Resolv'd, they should no longer wait, And suffer for their husband's fancies. Saint Francis must have been their guide; Most certainly Saint Francis knew, The ladies after the review— Forgot the key was left on the outside. Now silence reign'd, the fair ones slept, And out the watchful brethren came, Secur'd the door, and softly crept, Each bold Franciscan to his flame. There was no time for them to spare, For preface or solicitation, They seiz'd Time by the lock of hair, Without one word on the occasion. Finding their dears so hot and greedy, And so soon up and on again; The ladies, who were also needy, Found that resistance would be vain. One of the sisters had a notion, The alteration was so strange, That her's had taken some love potion, To make so very great a change. They bore it all with patient bearing, And without uttering a word; All the three wives, whilst they were pairing, Thought their's the only pairing bird. Each held her tongue, and took her feed, Pitying the two that stood in need. The Champions, after their great deeds, Gently retir'd, exhausted quite; And, with their baggage and their beads, March'd off as soon as it was light. The Merchants slept so long, thanks to the wine So well to both the parties suited, Their heads, on waking, ach'd no more than mine, And their wives rose fresh and recruited. Then huddling on their clothes, in the mean while Their tongues perpetually wagging, The smartest cried, with an arch smile, And with a tone of voice like bragging, “Pray, were you wak'd, like me, last night? Had you a visit from your Spouses?— If yours were in as fine a plight, They must have been about your houses: Mine wak'd me, and away he scour'd At once, and ran me out of breath; I thought I should have been devour'd; Press'd, hugg'd, and squeez'd, and crush'd to death.” “Ours too were in as good condition,” The others said, “What could it mean? It must have been the prohibition,” They all agreed, that made them all so keen. “Undoubtedly,” said Madam Smart; “Oft have I wonder'd, for my part, With what indifference they begin, And jog on in a lawful deed; But let it be a mortal sin, Heavens, with what ardour they proceed!— The men were up, and in their jackets, And were just putting on their shoes, When their wives enter'd with their packets, Full of glad tidings and great news. “No wonder that you lay till noon, After your last night's feats,” said they: “To come and break your oaths so soon, And make us break ours too was not fair play.” Each to her husband then repeated, How suddenly she was surpriz'd; How handsomely she had been treated, For which she hop'd he would not be chastiz'd. The fault was his; she had no blame; She was so hurry'd, Bated and worry'd, If 'twas to do again, she would do the same.— “You must be drunk or mad, I fear,” The husband cried, “'tis a clear case; I never stirr'd, or I'm not here, Out of my bed, out of this place.” And so they one and all declar'd, And look'd like simpletons and star'd. The women blush'd up to the ears, First thought of this, and then of that, And their suspicions and their fears, Made them begin to smell a rat. A Merchant, wiser than the rest, Making a sign they understood, Laugh'd and said, “Wife, we were in jest, My sins, I hope, have done us good, I hope,” said he, “you'll wish me joy, And our endeavours and joint labours, Will be productive of a boy— I wish the same for my two neighbours. An act,” said he, “you will allow, Of so great merit, It must repair our broken vow, You know, we broke it with great spirit.” “'Twas not enough,” said Mrs. Sly, “To break your oath, but you must run, And go to bed to make a lie; For which you don't deserve a son: And yet I hope and expect rather, Your son will not be like his father.” With that the females in a titter, Retir'd to gather up their litter. The women gone, the Merchant cried, “Brothers, you see how matters go; Our ladies have been monkcupy'd, Which is not fit for them to know: We must lock up this secret in our trunks; For if the faithful partners of our beds Should know their obligations to the Monks, Monks will be always running in their heads. To pocket the affront is right. As to our wives, 'tis best, you'll own, To lie with them ourselves at night, And never let them lie alone.” Whether the ladies doubts were clear'd away I never heard, so cannot say; But I have heard that ever after, Whene'er they met at any place, And look'd each other in the face, They fell into a fit of laughter. And with great gratitude and reason, For their devotion in due season, His blessing Saint Antonio sent, With three huge boys, made and conceiv'd, Monastically, 'tis believ'd, To the six pilgrims great content.— MORAL. Cleave to your wives, the Scripture says; I say, that cleaving is a blessing: But you must stick and cleave always, Or else your head may get a dressing. As close, as if you were tied and buckled, So close no creature can get at her; You might, my Lord, be made a cuckold, And I know nothing of the matter. To make a vow to leave your wife in danger, And let her lie alone and fob her, Is to lock up your cash before a stranger, And tempt him to become a robber: Which was exemplified, you find, In three bold Monks, all of one mind— This truth will follow from that sequel, Which ought to be observ'd and known, That one of us left quite alone, Or three of us together, are things equal. THE LAWYER'S TALE. TALE VIII. My story's true, as well as new, Of folks I know, that shall be nameless; Their real names are nought to you, I'll call my knight, Sir Joseph Shameless. His lady's woman, Kitty Patience, With wicked eyes, her teeth two rows of pearl, And all the sequel of the girl A complication of temptations. The knight had now and then the gout; To have it only now and then Is of great use to many men, It has its merits without doubt. Amongst the proverbs of my sire, The gout I have often heard him call The potent parent of desire, Without whose aid his doings were but small— I mean, he was not half so stout, And sometimes could not make it out —At all. My Lady in her stays, and Kitty lacing; My Lady's fingers busy round the border, Giving her snowy breasts a proper bracing, To keep them at a distance, and in order; So proud and bold they stand when they are parted, When they are near they droop, and look faint-hearted. The Knight came in—Said he, “how finely You plump them out, they look divinely— Kitty's tetons have got no stay, They seem to scorn any assistance; If they should happen to give way, They'll turn again, and make resistance:” With that he thrusts his hand into her neck, My Lady turn'd about and smil'd, Without the least rebuke or check, She only said, “you should not let him, child.” Patience replied, with downcast eye, “I thought there was no harm; as you were by—” My Lady said, “No, not the least— Kitty, I have seen you quite undrest; If you will treat him with a feast, These two are vouchers for the rest.” Kitty was then mistress of arts; The Knight, without a cry of murther, Long since had visited those parts, And gone till he could go no further. His Lady knew that he lov'd change; He knew her passions were as strong, She could not be averse to range, She was so apt to fancy things and long. They went and came without each other's knowing, Both of them lov'd to change the scene; They never ask'd where they were going, Nor once enquir'd where each had been— One day the Knight fell fast asleep, The Knight was in his gouty chair; A Captain and my Lady fair, On the settee in meditation deep. She rose and went behind the screen, And he, to see what she could mean. They staid not there, you must have thought, Standing like fools and doing nought. At the conclusion of their sport, And whilst the room and screen were shaking, Sir Joseph heard her breathing short, Just at the moment he was waking. He was acquainted with her notes, And knew, that from her dying song, Her time was come, 'twould not be long Before she shook her petticoats: Her petticoats to smooth the gathers, Just like a hen, that shakes her feathers— As long as he could hear them prancing He would not interrupt their dancing. “What noise was that?” Sir Joseph cried, “'Twas a strange noise I heard just now.” My Lady readily replied, “I can't account for it I vow; For God's sake let us run away, It was an earthquake, I dare say.” “An a?se quake,” said the Knight, “it was a squàll! A sudden gust of wind, that's all—” And so she said the Captain said before:— “The Captain's in the right,” Sir Joseph swore.— They took their evening walk, she and her friend, Kitty came down to make Sir James's tea: The Knight told Kitty in the end, What he had heard; but could not stir to see. “If you can catch them in the fact, And can but see what I heard now, With proofs enough to get an act, Who knows but I may marry you? Kitty, you shall not lie alone, I'll either marry you or none.” Patience, whose name implies submission, Soon executed her commission, Kitty's was oscular demonstration, The Captain sitting like a lout, Her Lady in a situation, As if the Captain had the gout. Said he, “do shew me how she did it.” She answer'd modestly, “I'll try;” And then she dandled it, and slid it, And Kitty did it by and by. 'Twas the first time she play'd upon the stage. But afterwards few could play better, In any part she could engage, The ablest Manager could set her. So far from bold, Kitty till then, Was so discreet, you could not guess; Especially amongst the men, Which were more modest, Kitty's looks or dress. But now she soon threw off the mask, She gave herself prodigious airs, You may be sure you need not ask, As well above as below stairs. There was a Lawyer that liv'd near, For whom at last Sir Joseph sent, And order'd Kitty to appear, Having told the Lawyer his intent. “Patience,” said he, “it is no shame, Be not asham'd to speak the truth; You must describe the romping game, My Lady, romping with the youth.” Kitty look'd down, put on a frown, Look'd up, and then she look'd aside; She pull'd a pin out of her gown, Look'd at the pin, and then reply'd— “I saw my Lady with her legs astride, Wagging her tail upon the Captain's knee; And after she had done her ride, Sit like a bird perch'd on a tree: Upon her perch she did not long remain, He gave a spring, and she set out again. I never could have thought of such a trick— I saw it through my Lady's closet door; The very sight made me so sick, I could not stay to see it any more; But ran directly from the place, And went into the open air, And after told his Honour the whole case; Sitting exactly then as he sits there Although the gout had left his feet, Tell it again, he said, and bring a seat. I knew Sir Joseph's meaning, I dare say; Sir Joseph thought that I would vary, In my relating her vagary, He knows I always told it the same way. For he has made me tell it o'er and o'er, A dozen times at least, if not a score—” “Did you see rem in re?” said he— “I did,” said she; “first on dry land, I saw rem in my Lady's hand; And, after that, saw rem in re. She put it there; I saw how it was teaz'd— Now it was quite up to the chin, And then again half out half in, Just as my Lady pleas'd. Her stays and petticoats upon the floor, She in her shift and gown, with nothing more. And all the time her shift and gown Up to her shoulders like a shawl, As she went up and down, I saw it all.—” The Lawyer said, “were you alone? Was there none else?”—Said she, “not one.” “One witness, Madam, will not do. Why Miss,” said he, “were there not two? And as Sir Joseph sent you out— He told me so; Why would you go Alone to scout?— I had a case the other night— Exactly the same case, as it was stated, Between a Damsel and a Knight, But not by far so well related. The evidence is not deficient, For there are three; two are sufficient. And therefore I advise, Miss Kitty, To leave off spying; I know spies They talk and see, although their eyes Are not so fine, nor teeth so pretty; And females that are as discerning, But very short of Miss in learning.—” Upon some hints thrown out by Patience, Before my Lady, she from thence Set maids to watch, made preparations, And got enough for her defence. Before the Lawyer's wife they came, With all the facts, clearly describ'd and well; They could not have told him for shame, All that she undertook to tell; Sir Joseph said, “Kitty, you see A spy is but a sorry trade; I found, I thought, one cunning jade, I find my Lady has found three. And therefore we must be content, And lie together with my wife's consent: She will not care with whom I'm sleeping, Provided both are bound and ty'd, That information got by peeping, Shall not avail on either side. So both remain, coupled per force, Till Death has got her in his power, Or she's entitled to her dower, Neither can suffer a divorce.” MORAL. There are not more than six or seven, I think, at farthest, in a year, Of weddings that are made in Heaven, All other weddings are made here; At concerts, balls, at fairs, and races, Scarb'rough, and all terraqueous places. Suppose you have no friend above, And it should chance to be your fate, Instead of a celestial dove, To get a wild-goose for your mate: E'en let her take her flight and roam, Never let that disturb your rest; Provide a substitute at home, Of a bad bargain make the best; The best you can, I ought to say; The best is—putting her away. THE BARON'S TALE. TALE IX. “Ladies,” said Frank, with ladies walking, “Please to observe that avery there, Suppose their singing goes for talking, Their down, for any downy hair. They are the types of our gay world, You know fine feathers make fine birds; Our belles, like theirs painted and curl'd With crimson cheeks, and breasts like curds. Our macaronies with their muffs, Are not like singing birds, but piping ruffs. The only difference I find, Our beaux are vain, the ruffs are proud, All our belles feign, theirs speak their mind, But are as talkative and loud. Pray, ladies, walk a little nearer, You'll see the microcosm clearer; Behold those lovers sitting cooing, With little interludes of billing, Others proceeding without wooing, Both are so amorous and willing; Their hops, love-feasts, and agapees; Our balls, methodist night-wakes, cotteries; That bird in dishabille alone Is a fine lady in the pout, 'Till her fine feathers are full grown Her ladyship frequents no rout.—” Said Lady Bridget, “your remarks are smart, But where are there old maids, I pray? With your sharp eyes and all your art, Can you descry one bachelor grown grey?” “Faith,” Frank replied, “'twould be the same thing here, Could we contract, like them, from year to year.” “Maids can contract on credit now, She said, “but not with folks like you. Marry, and for your sins atone, A wife is easy to bespeak, Though you are not a precious stone, She'll take you for a verd antique.” “My sins might have been pardon'd long ago, I could,” said Frank, “have married you, you know. At thirty, one may venture on a wife, At forty-eight, I dare not for my life. Listen, and I will tell you why At forty there is so much danger; Ladies, a story hangs thereby, None of you ever heard a stranger. In Lombard-street there dwelt a Banker, Not quite a hundred years ago; At thirty-nine he dropp'd his anchor, About the purlieus of Soho. Service of plate, pinery, villa; Yet God forgive him for his pride; And with a Venus for his pillow, This Banker was not satisfied. In Parliament he had a seat, But by deep study and reflection, And by conversing with the great, He found the want of a connexion: That honour seldom is conferr'd On people of our rank and station; Unless it cannot be deferr'd, It requires great consideration. At last, a Peer offer'd his niece, That had been offer'd to a pleader, A fine, plump, buxom, roomy piece, Calculated for a breeder. Miss and her Lover scarce were seated— At once she yielded to the Banker; His errand was not twice repeated, Before he rose to kiss and thank her. This also is the ton at present, And more compendious and pleasant. Upon the wedding night, in sum, Having arriv'd at kingdom come; Attack'd the fort with his whole power, Forc'd barricades, gates, and portcullis, With its attendant chains and pullies, He broke into the dungeon tower: But when he thought his victory complete, A sudden sally forc'd him to retreat— You never read of such a Knight, In any chronicle before, A little boy put him to flight, And drove him from the dungeon door: Screaming aloud, as the Knight fled, Behold the bride was brought to bed! Hearing the shout, the Bridemaids blush'd; One man cried, “girls, the castle's won, Such an affair must not be hush'd, But the Bride's part seems overdone. Why scream and shriek, 'twas not like taking Troy? Up with the posset; let us wish them joy.” They ran up stairs; then rapp'd and cried, Refreshment for the Groom and Bride, After so hardy an adventure! No answer came; the Bridegroom rose, And leisurely put on his cloaths, Sat by the fire, and bad them enter. Our Bridemaids thought the place was ta'en, That both the citadel and town Were laid in ashes, or pull'd down, They heard the shrieks and cries so plain: “At present, they have chang'd their mind,” Said one, “or else they must be blind. For, far from a triumphant form, His downcast eyes and drooping crest Pronounce it a defective storm, Or a drawn battle at the best.” The Bridegroom cried, “the cause lies yonder, A cause to ruminate and ponder; 'Twould make the richest Nabob stare, Such an expence he could not bear; Hardly the King, much less a Peer, If every time he takes a bout, A Master or a Miss pops out, What must they 'mount to in a year?” On which he unclos'd the curtains where she laid, Somewhat abash'd, but not dismay'd. He turn'd the clothes down, and subjoin'd, “'Tis worth your while to see what's in't, Ecce Homo! stamp'd and coin'd, An hour ago, fresh from the mint;” Then made his bow, and march'd off smiling, Without reproaching or reviling. In ten days after, she and her homuncle, Return'd to their right honourable uncle. He knew, before he took her to Soho, The whole house knew it by the bye, She had not many weeks to go, But did not think her time so nigh. A Privy Council was then sitting, In Cloacina's temple met, Of females arguing and sh?, About a certain famous bet. What share my Lord had in the cow and calf, Whether the whole or only half? The sentence, without an appeal, Wrote on the wall, seal'd with the Privy Seal. The sentence written there was droll, The calf should not be cut in two, The Butler should enjoy it whole, His Lordship might divide the cow, And Lord have mercy on her soul. Said Lady Bridget, “great or small, There is some risk, I do confess, At forty, nay, perhaps at less; Marry before, or not at all:” Which, for a Moral, may suffice, For any Bachelor that's wise A Lady upon her wedding night was brought to bed, in the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles—The Tale is taken from this hint—the hint, and very little more beside..— THE PHYSICIAN'S TALE. TALE X. Amongst the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, Some Tales unmodernis'd remain, Which I would not attempt to tell, Had they been told by La Fontaine: And this of mine amongst the rest, Call'd antidote de la Peste. Said Mrs. Slip Slop, “that may be, But of all stories I admior Hans Carvel told by Matthew Prior, No one can tell a tale like he. Carvel impossible and old, His finger in his wife's gold ring;” “How do you know that it was gold?” The Doctor said, “'twas no such thing. Carvel's wife's picture, I declare, Is always drawn with auburn hair; Like Mrs. Slip Slop's, lock for lock, Bushy and curling very fine, Just like the tendrils of a vine, About a stake or stumpy stock.” “Doctor, proceed in your own way,” My Lady cried; “Slip Slop have done, You talk and know not what you say, When once your tongue begins to run. In Dauphiny, by his relation, A plague arose that rag'd as sore, And caus'd as great a desolation, As that of Athens heretofore. When once the plague is upon duty, To punish mortals for their sins, She neither cares for youth nor beauty, For high nor low, for outs nor ins— Upon a sweet young lady's face, She breath'd her pestilential breath, The fair one wou'd not quit the place, Neither for the plague nor death. In cities storm'd, 'twere better far, Whate'er betide, For a young maiden to abide, And take the accidents of war. Struck on a sudden and dismay'd, To a good widow she repair'd, Who neither was herself afraid, Nor for her lovely friend despair'd; But gave her cordials, and, in brief, Hope, the best cordial for grief. “This is no season for disguise; “Have you,” said she, “eat of the Tree of Life, That makes us at fifteen as wise, As a sage dowager or wife?” The poor thing cry'd, “oh! if I had, I should not think my fate so bad! Many die young, and in full bloom, But few like me go to their tomb; Not one, if we could know the truth, When Love in every artery beats, With all the powers and charms of youth, Without once tasting of its sweets. Even now, Death would not be so frightful, If I could get, before I go, A hearty meal of what you know, And what I am told is so delightful— And, if God please, May be a cure for the disease.” Her friend reply'd, “that is soon done; For, God be thank'd, there are enow, Enow, that have nought else to do.” The fair maid cry'd, “for God's sake run: I know at least of three or four, That I have oft' refus'd before; One very much against my will: 'Tis master John, bring him anon; For, by St. Luke, my master John Must either cure or kill.” Behold him ready at her beck, Behold her arms about his neck; At once, pour vous le couper court, There was no petite oye, no toys, Like half-fledg'd girls and foolish boys, To antecede parfait amour. Finish'd, repeated o'er and o'er, 'Till master John could do no more. She staid and play'd, not without pain, But found it all labour in vain: “My dear,” said she, “you have done me good; I thank you for your good intention, But yet you cannot cool my blood, With all your goodness and attention. Go, my dear love, and go to bed, And send the Marquis in your stead.” He sent the Marquis, then laid down, Sent for the Curate and confess'd; And after that obtain'd the crown Of martyrdom amongst the bless'd.— The Marquis far'd the very same, And died without quenching her flame. The Widow recommended next A subject for the vacant chair, A swain that never was perplex'd, Either with thinking or with care; Form'd and constructed on a plan, To build a complete widow's man; During the whole co-operation, Far more severe than I can paint; Till he was forc'd to quit his station, She never utter'd a complaint. He went home jaded, you'll believe; But how, without St. Luke's protection, He should escape without infection, Is not so easy to conceive. Her Father, hearing she was smitten, Sent a sedan and chairmen able, To bring her home as was befitting, But first to land her in the stable, Till they were ready to receive her, And all things got that could relieve her. As fresh as when she first set out, Before she went to the pest room, She took a handsome farewell bout, Concluding with her Father's Groom. The Damsel, when her bed was ready, Leaning upon her Nurse retir'd, Resign'd and steady; And four hours after the poor groom expir'd. Consign'd to her old Nurse's care, She had not lain above two hours, Before the sweat broke out in showers, Next came on each side, you know where, A bijou very fine to see, This like her watch, and that like her etui; Then fell into a sleep profound, And wak'd next morning safe and sound. Three months were past, the fact was clear, She prov'd with child, nor would deny it— To her good Mother, as you'll hear, She own'd in part how she came by it.— Three of the candidates were gone, Three she destroy'd you know before, Three out of four; Therefore it fell to the surviving one, On whom she was bestow'd in marriage; And put an end to all dispute, About the planter and the fruit, Next day by a miscarriage.—” THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE. Nature has taken special care, If you consider and examine, To guard the fair Against plague, pestilence, and famine. Therefore we ought to give God praise, That they're not scarce, but in great plenty, Or otherwise, for such a dainty, We should be cutting throats always. For our sakes, Ladies, and your own, If there should happen to appear The Influenza, like last year, Follow this regimen alone. As to the dose, I cannot guess, Unless I knew your constitution; It may be more, it may be less, But, more or less, take it with resolution.— This you must note, A plague requires much more than a sore throat. THE APOTHECARY'S TALE. TALE XI. Apothecaries are not fit, None but Apothecary King, To deal in gallantry or wit— They may tell tales, or ditties sing. Always providing and supposing, They are not of their own composing; As I am call'd on in succession, I shall stick close to my profession. A Quack, in a small country town, According to report, Got great renown, For his great cures of every sort. He never used to bleed or blister, Or to give bolus, pill, or potion; His panacea Over the Doctor's door was written, in capitals: REMEDIUM UNIVERSALE; with a motto from Horace: ?Id quod Æque pauperibus prodest Locupletibus æque Æque neglectum pueris, Senibus que nocebit. was a lotion, Or a detergent, call'd a clyster; And this was constantly apply'd, Upon the spot where he resided, To every backside That would abide it. A cobler came from a great distance, With a full confidence possess'd, Imploring his assistance, Taking him for a conjuror profess'd. For he had heard in various places Of his success in conjuring cases. Beside his stall and cobling gift, He kept a stye, And therein kept a boar, whereby He made a tolerable shift. An ancient pig, of that fair sex, Came on a visit to the boar; The boar was gone, which needs must vex, And make the matron gruntle sore. The Cobler's trust was in the cunning man, He search'd woods, valleys, hills and plains, But all in vain, for all his pains; So to the conjuror he ran. “The Ladies ought to know, before Your Tale goes on,” said the Physician, “The definition of a boar— 'Tis Mrs. Slip Slop's definition— An animal with a curl'd tail, With testibles like melons more than figs, The most continuaceous male, Ingeniously contriv'd for making pigs: Pigs, made between sleeping and waking, They take so long a time in making. From whence, by Mrs. Slip Slop's leave, To make the matter still more plain, A metaphor is taken, That from her drawing you'll conceive. Thus, all the maccaroni corps, Call a long story, or narration, Which is a slow dull operation, A boar. You understand it now, thanks to your vestal; And, my dear Ladies, I implore you, Hark to the Knight of the great Pestle, I promise you, he will not boar you.” The Cobler squeezing through the crowd, The Doctor heard him ask his aid, But could make nought of what he said, The Doctor's patients talk'd so loud. “Take him away,” the Doctor cried, “Convey him quickly to the artist, Let him immediately be plied With an injection of the smartest.” On which they took him as directed, And all at once; not by degrees, Crispin was copiously injected, Then set at large, paying his fees. As he march'd home, he made a stop, The remedy began to work; Which forc'd the Cobler to uncork, A dunghill drank it every drop: Like bachelors and black-legg'd gamblers, Boars run about and are great ramblers. Our Cobler's boar was lodging there, And, grunting at the noise, put out his snout, On which the Cobler turn'd about, Held up his hands, and utter'd a short pray'r. “The Lord be prais'd!” said he, “and for the same, “Laudamus to the Conjuror's name.” Not only he, his wife, his sister, The Parish and the Vicar too, Believe it was the Doctor's clyster, That found his pig out—“what think you?” MORAL. In times of troubles and of war, A Conjuror's no bad vocation, Better by far Than in a quiet situation. The country vulgar always run To the Attorney, Parson, Squire, Or London Rider, to enquire, Whether or no they are undone: And we that think ourselves their betters, Apply to some great man of letters: To Doctor Johnson, not the amphibious; To Dr. Priestley, Franklin's rival; Or to the reverend and ambiguous Mr. W?ll; Who send us to some cunning man, To Fox or Burke, Or my Lord Smirk, The cunningest of all the clan These mount the therapeutick rostrum: One deals in amulets and charms, Another sells a famous nostrum, That animates, corrects, and warms; The third, a subtile distillation To numb the sense of amputation. If any of them should by chance Guess right, and make a lucky hit, Mercy upon us! how they prance! How we sing praises and are bit This Tale in part is taken from the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles; it is not every one that can read them; if the Reader can, he is desired to compare with those the Tales that are in some measure borrowed from thence, and which are always mentioned; and he will observe, that the Author is neither a translator, nor an imitator; but has an indisputable right, with Fontaine, to originality. The Lady is too modest to have made the request herself; it is made at the request of the Publisher.. THE CONFESSION OF SIR FRANCIS OF MEDENHAM, AND OF THE LADY MARY HIS WIFE. The sins of Lubricity, however shocking or unnatural, are handled in this absurd and impious manner by Escobar, and all the most celebrated Casuists amongst the Jesuits. THE CONFESSION OF THE KNIGHT. [To the tune of, The abbot of Canterbury.] The good Frier was in the Confessional Chair, “By my Faith,” said Sir Francis, “I'm glad you are there; My sins are so heavy, and gall me so sore, Till you lighten their weight I can carry no more. Derry down, down, &amp;c. Proceed, said the Frier, no trifles I pray, I expect all the wives of the Parish to-day, My sins, said Sir Frank, are not many, nor old; But no trifles I bring, they're as sterling as gold. Derry down, &amp;c. As your time is so precious, to save repetitions, Without any comment or any omissions, I will open my budget, and lay down my deeds, Rank and file in a string, like St. Francis's beads. Derry down, &amp;c. Like a Hotspur young cock he began with his mother, Cheer'd three of his sisters one after another; And oft tried little Jen, but gain'd so little ground, Little Jen lost her patience, and made him compound. Derry down, &amp;c. Jen play'd on the flute, with her fingers so white, And twinkled her eyes, and kept time very right, Then he serv'd up his cousin, a delicate blade, And old Bridget his aunt, for the sake of her maid. Derry down, &amp;c. And, lastly, he ravish'd his Lady so meek, When she had not lain-in much more than a week, Although she declar'd she would give her consent, But had vow'd the last week to lie fallow in Lent. Derry down, &amp;c. “These are eight deadly sins,” said Sir Francis, and cried; “Yet the gates,” said the Frier, “of mercy are wide; I can reckon but five, for I pass little Jen, And old Bridget's a penance instead of a sin. Derry down, &amp;c. As to wives—there's no part of a wife is her own, For the church gives a part, and the parts are well known; To withhold what she gives you is sinful and strange, And courtesy gives you the rest for a change. Derry down, &amp;c. The wife is to blame that replies or demurs; If the act is a sin, 'tis her husband's, not her's: Let her yield to his fancies, his right is so strong; And his bargain so hard, he can hardly go wrong. Derry down, &amp;c. Though to cuckold the church is a sin that's unclean, Yet, when the blood's heated, as your's must have been, We have power to suspend the effect of her curse, If you had not done that, you must needs have done worse. Derry down, &amp;c. Thank God, you have none—had you brothers a dozen, They would all have been serv'd the same sauce with your cousin: But tell me sincerely, my penitent son, How long were you doing before you had done. Derry down, &amp;c. I perceive, by the last, that your fever was strong; So I guess, quoth the Frier, 'twas not very long; For, if there had been any great intermission, You must have thrown in a small dose of contrition.” Derry down, &amp;c. “'Twas all done in six hours,” said the Knight to the Frier. “You'll be damned,” cried the Monk, “for a damnable liar; Neither you can dispatch, nor the devil, in fine, As much work in six hours as will take a monk nine. Derry down, &amp;c. After all,” said the Frier, “in all kinds of sport A keen sportsman is apt to believe the time's short: So your sins I absolve; but to wipe them out quite, I enjoin you to lie with old Bridget all night.” Derry down, down, down, derry down. THE LADY'S CONFESSION. With a veil o'er her eyes and her bosom all bare, Lady Mary kneel'd down, whilst the tears of despair Down her cheeks and round breasts like hillocks of snow, Descended in rills to the valley below. Derry down, down, &amp;c. “Such tears of remorse, my fair penitent child, Flow seldom in vain,” said the Frier and smiled: “I'll ensure you quite through, you have nothing to dread, From the sole of your foot to the hair of your head. Derry down, &amp;c. Though he neither minds bell, book, and candle, nor grate, And is constantly tempting you early and late, The tempter of Adam will at last, I believe, Be too cunning and strong for the tempter of Eve. Derry down, &amp;c. All the devil can do with his pricking and spurring Is to set you a longing and set you a stirring, Like boys o'er an orchard half dropping, half sticking, From longing you soon fall to handling and picking. Derry down, &amp;c. And when you have handled and pick'd what you will, From the ladies at court to the lass of the mill, You come here and repent with great sorrow and shame, And the devil must go back like a fool as he came. Derry down, &amp;c. The devil can easily trip up your heels; But what then? You are all such a parcel of eels, When your sins lie upon you, you'll every one Riggle out like an eel that lies under a stone. Derry down, &amp;c. Then take courage, dear daughter, unburthen your mind, And be sure, above all, you leave nothing behind; 'Tis no shame to discover what is death to conceal, For your doctor must visit the parts he must heal.” Derry down, &amp;c. “In you, my good father and heavenly guide, I put my whole trust,” the fair lady replied, “And will therefore premise, with most scrupulous truth, A few of the sins I concealed in my youth. Derry down, &amp;c. I was taught at sixteen, by a masculine nun, Till I learnt, from a pistol, to handle a gun; And then I encounter'd a frier from Furne's That used to serve her and the abbess by turns. Derry down, &amp;c. No Flanderkin monk, since good monks were begot, Could furnish more game for an abbess's pot; But how the nun came by such luck should be known, You must know that the abbess was deaf as a stone. Derry down, &amp;c. Though as deaf as a stone, yet so sound and so nice, Was her judgement, when steer'd by the frier's advice, She consign'd to my nun, as the flower of the flock, The keys of St. Peter, to open and lock. Derry down, &amp;c. Thus my nun watch'd the signals, and had for her pains, Both the abbess's leavings, and other small gains; For the abbess to balance and make accounts fair, Put all the young novices under her care. Derry down, &amp;c. Now, whether in Sappho 'twas passion or whim, She amused herself better with me than with him; So we struck up a bargain that pleased us all three, And I stuck to the frier, and she stuck to me. Derry down, &amp;c, Like a filly, quite aukward at first in a manage, I neither had action or grace in my carriage; But from the first lesson to every new chapter He found me improve, and I found myself apter. Derry down, &amp;c. And thus we went on in a round of delight, When, to vary the scene, I fell in with a knight, Who had found a way into my cell like a fairy, And went out, like a surfeited rat from a dairy. Derry down, &amp;c. Between frier and knight, my Lesbian's brother, I was like to become an unfortunate mother; But by her assistance and skill I miscarried, And at last, through her means, to Sir Francis was married. Derry down, &amp;c. Twas his confessor's trick, 'twas the frier of Flanders, To whom all the friers on earth are but ganders; Who, to save the knight's soul, set his sister a dreaming, When 'twas mortgaged so deep it was scarce worth redeeming. Derry down, &amp;c. Since the time that the frier has quitted this quarter I have sometimes had luck and sometimes caught a Tartar; But I never yet played with a squire or a knight That could play with such temper and lose the whole night.” Derry down, &amp;c. I know, said the frier, they all are slack mettled, And you'll always be changing and always unsettled, Instead of one sin you'll have four sins to score, And your profits and income be less than before. Derry down, &amp;c. The sins of your youth are forgiven and sunk, From the first of the nun to the last of the monk; But there's nothing can take out a burn like the fire, Nor the heat a monk leaves but the heat of a frier. Derry down, &amp;c. I soon could convince you my counsel is right; Said my lady, “Good father, convince me to-night, Do but come to the door of our garden at ten.” “Adieu,” said the frier, “fair daughter, till then.” Derry down, down, down, derry down. ANOTHER TALE, FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF MY MILITARY FRIENDS. MDCCLXXXII. THE AID-DE-CAMP EFFECTIVE: OR, THE CONSCIENCIOUS PARSON. 'Tis seldom seen, 'tis seldom read, And 'tis, my friends, as seldom said, When Man to Mate you tie, or tether, That old and young agree together.— Whence comes it?—Each, of different age, A different passion will assuage: While Madam follows Pleasure's plan, Perhaps Ambition guides the Man; Or Avarice goads him on to Riches, While vixen Wife would wear the Breeches. But, in the day, the discord's slight, To what they must expect at night; For sad! indeed, the Husband's lot, Should Spouse's blood but prove too hot. Yet that can be avoided too, If what our story tells be true.— A General, ancient in the wars, Whose front was mark'd with twenty scars, To make his hours the lighter pass, In Friendship married a young lass. Skill'd too he was in arts of peace, Nor thought to live in perfect ease: He'd pass his days in dismal plight, Were dearest Rib not pleas'd at night. So, soon as settled in their house, He kindly thus address'd his spouse:— “Think not, my Love, I was so vain, (Forgive me, if I speak too plain), As to suppose, when I did wed, I was a match for you—in bed— Ah! no;—I took thee for my wife, To soothe me in declining life; Thy converse sweet is all I want; For other joys thy heart must pant; My blood now flows in gentle pace, But thine must run its youthful race; Choose then, in all my handsome corps, A young gallant, to please thee more.— Blush not, my Love, and do not fear To own thy flame;—I am sincere.” With modest look and downcast eyes, His spouse express'd unfeign'd surprise; Then feign'd resentment at his speech, As if he meant to make a breach, And cast her off for doxy dearer; But, when he spoke his meaning clearer, And swore it was to please them both, She gave consent (but seeming loth) An Aid-de-Camp, at country house, Shou'd e'er attend upon her spouse; And secret, there, perform his duty— (Per General's Orders) to her beauty. It so fell out—the garden wall Was much too low to cover all. The Parson, from his window, saw In neighbour's wife a filthy flaw. What Parson wou'd not take amiss, To see the pair so loving kiss? So often dance, so often frisk, As thinking nought of sin or risk?— At last his very bowels boil'd, To see the dame so oft defil'd; His neighbour wrong'd, too, by a friend, On whose firm faith he should depend;— Eke Envy stirr'd him;—so sly John A grave and saintly face put on;— Then, taking gown and cleanest band, He went to neighbour, hat in hand; And, begging much to be excused, For the great liberty he used, He told him how he was abused By Friend and Spouse, in whom he trusted, Who nought but for each other lusted.— The General smil'd, and thus reply'd: “Is that all, John, you have espy'd? Why, Man, this Aid-de-Camp I give Free bed and board, with us to live; And fifty pounds a-year, beside, To do—the very thing you spy'd.”— “If so, quoth John, I was to blame, For hinting at your Honour's shame. Good friends and neighbours we should be: Wou'd you but still apply to me, (Your spouse, I doubt, is not too nice) I'd serve her, Sir, for half the price.” FINIS.</field>
