      <field name="fulltext">âPoesy! thou sweet'st content That e'er heaven to mortals lent; Tho' they as a trifle leave thee, Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee; Tho' thou be to them a scorn That to nought but earth are born; Let my life no longer be, Than I am in love with thee. Tho' our wise ones call thee madness, Let me never taste of gladness, If I love not thy maddest fits More than all their greatest wits. And tho' some, too seeming holy, Do account thy raptures folly, Thou dost teach me to contemn What makes knaves and fools of them.â George Wither. TO ROBERT FETHERSTON, Esq. M. D. ODE TO FANCY. This Poem was honoured with a Prize Medal by the Historical Society, T. C. D. 1813. Oh Fancy, hither bend thy flight, Hither steer thy car of light, Tho' its rainbow colours flee Ere they have shone a moment on my sight; Come, Fancy, come, and bring with thee The light-wing'd forms of air, that glance Upon the Poet's dizzy view, Which, when he waketh from his rapturous trance, No effort can renew, No tongue their beauty can declare, No thought conceive how wond'rous fair; Like the light clouds, whose folds are drest It is often difficult to ascertain how far the resemblances of thought we meet in the works of different writers are to be attributed to accident or design. Some time after this Ode was inserted on the books of the late âHistorical Society,â the âWorld before the Floodâ was published by Mr. Montgomery. I was surprised to find the visions of the poet there spoken of as beingâFrail as the clouds of sunset, and as fair âPageants of light, resolving into air.â I have since found a similar thought beautifully expressed by Mr. Southey in the first book of Joan of Arc. Though the image was certainly new to me at the time I wrote the foregoing lines, I would much more willing erase it than detain my reader by this justification, if I did not feel myself obliged to print the Ode as it lies on the Society Books. With varying tints on Summer eve, Their hues are chang'd, before the breast Distinctly can receive A settled thought of what they were, She knows alone that they were fair! Oh Fancy, let such forms delight Thy votary's longing eye; Or if they may not meet my sight, Come THOU, tho' all the winds of night Around thy chariot fly; Come, tho' dark Horrour come with thee, And the pale fiend distracted Fear Unfold to my congealing ear His tale of mystery! Yes, I will listen, while his breath Tells of the dagger, on whose blade Still gleams the red red mark of Death, Tho' long the day since Murder laid Upon the deadly dirk his desperate grasp, And heard, delighted heard, his victim's last faint gasp, And gaz'd with unaverted eye On the last writhe of agony, While with unshivering hand he prest His dagger in the sleeper's breast; Yes, I will hark, tho' Fear may tell In piercing tone the tales of Hell, Will listen, Fancy, if thy faintest gleam Tinge the dark and dreadful theme! Fancy, with thee I love to stray, With thee would seek the dungeon's gloom, Renounce for aye the visions gay That Pleasure's tints illume; Would listen to the owlet's cry, Would hear the winds of Winter sigh Amid the leafless trees; Would hark the Spirit shrilly scream, Would view the meteor's boding beam, Would court thy most terrific dream, Till my heart's blood did freeze; Would lie the tremulous avalanche beneath, Where the least pant is instant death, If thy rich visions swam before my eye; Would launch the light skiff, where the wild waves sweep Down Niagara's dizzying steep, If thy angelic form was nigh, If with thy hues the mountain-snow was bright, If thou didst tinge the wave with thy rich lines of light. But sweeter, Fancy, is the trance, When thy hues of splendour glance On the dim and aching eye That weeps in sad reality, Thy visions cheer the hapless breast, That, braving in unequal strife The dark and stormy sea of life, Sighs for the haven of its rest; And, as the star in heaven's blue cope Sheds joy upon the sailor's soul, So dost thou dart a ray of hope Upon the mourner's heart; So does thy gentle art The power of misery controul! Tho' fortune o'er the scene may throw The wintry cloud of want and woe, Yet thou, Enchantress, thou canst fling The tints of visionary spring Upon thy votary's sight, And paint in hues divinely bright An after season of delight. Oh Fancy, tho' thy cup contain The draught of woe, and piercing pain, Tho' oft thy flattering magic hand Depict the future fair, When suddenly the figures bland Dissolve away in air; Tho', when the Demon of Despair Tears the pain'd breast with pointed fang, Thou, Fancy, givest an added pang To the keen wound of care, Tho' thou bid the blood-streaked eye Redden in feverish agony, Yet is the man thy woes oppress Gifted with heighten'd happiness; For him, in rapture's hour, the heart Bounds with a livelier measure; To him Creation's stores impart A grander sense of pleasure! The traveller thus, in Arab-sands, Whose lips are parch'd, whose limbs are faint, Whose troubled thoughts for ever paint The tyger's fangs, the Bedouin bands, Whose camel now with faltering pace Strives the burning path to trace, See in that wanderer's looks exprest The hopeless anguish of his breast; âBut now! mark! mark that start of joy, Mark how he strains his swollen eye; He sees yon distant spot, so green, Shine circled with the desert sea, Mark! mark empictur'd in his mien The flush of hope, of extasy; The fall, and flash of waters near Delight the heart, and eye, and ear! Now has his weary journey ceast, And now he spreads his simple feast, And, sheltered by the o'erarching palm, Enjoys the spot so sweet, so calm! Was ever bliss thus perfect known To him for whom delight alone Had spread the silken couch of ease, And fann'd his breast with pleasure's breeze? Thus to the man, inur'd to smart With feelings by the throng unfelt, For him with deeper joy the heart In rapture's hour will melt, Will view a prospect hid from vulgar sight, The Eden-bower of pure and unalloy'd delight! But chiefly on the Poet's mind Thine influence is shed, His eye expatiates unconfin'd Upon thy vast expanse, He views with kindling glance Thy peopled scenes before him spread! Then Fancy bid my page to gleam With some faint colouring from thy beam; To thee the Poet's hopes belong, Bid then thy light illume my song! I call thee by thy Collins' rage, By thy Warton's gothic page, By thy Spenser's faerie slumbers, By thy Shakespeare's witching numbers; By thy Southey's grander lay, Shed, Fancy, shed thy joyous ray! Or move me far from Mirth's mad folly To the haunts of Melancholy; There shall I view the air around Haunted by many a spectral form, Shall hear the boding spirit sound Amid the howlings of the storm; Shall in the night-bird's shriek descry The mystic tones of prophecy, And, as the meteor's beams appal, Behold the coming funeral, Or view the ancient chieftain's lance With momentary lustre glance, As sitting in his cloudy car He thinks upon his days of war! Or, gazing on the moon's pale light, Whose mild and melancholy ray Gives softer, and more sweet delight Than the majestic orb of Day, I then will deem that, while she glows For base and thankless Man, She mourns the vices and the woes, That dim his little span; Or think mayhap her light is shed Upon the moat's moss cover'd bed, To gild the feasts of harmless fays, Who sport beneath the holy blaze; Then shall the thoughts of other times Rouse me to try adventurous rhymes, And to the harp's deep music chaunt The story of some old romaunt; Thus my rapt soul, with gothic glories fraught, In Fancy's bower shall muse, and court Poetic Thought. THE POET'S HAUNT. 'Tis beautiful indeedâthro' parted boughs To see the moving clouds darken the sky, To mark their many-shifting forms, and tints, As slow they pass, then see the lively blue Pure, spotless, like the soul, that hath forgot Unworthy passions, or, if dimm'd awhile, Soon shines reclaim'd:â'tis sweet to view that rill, Stealing thro' moss-grown stones, so playfully As if it fear'd to soil one starry flower:â How many a primrose-wreath along its bank Might I now gather, but methinks the Fay, Whose little urn supplies this sparkling stream, Who flings the morning dew-drop on this rose, Might shun the violated haunt, nor bid The water, as it drips from stone to stone Then flows continuous, till some gadding briar Or wild flower's tuft impede its onward course, Speak to the ear with soft and pleasant voice, Like broken music of some oft-heard song That in the lonely hour we fain would catch, That blesses now, and now eludes the ear.â How do I love to lie beneath the shade Of this broad sycamore! the spirit here That loves the song oft lingers, when the soul Lies in that doubtful mood, when thoughts that pass Across its moveless surface leave no trace, When Memory sleeps, and Feeling only wakes, And we but learn from interrupted thought That we had thought at allâthen not in vain Doth Nature breathe, and Nature's breath is song! Thou dost not rightly worship POETRY, To whom there is no music in the leaves Rustling in ceaseless murmurs, as the winds Play thro' their boughsâif when the thunders roar, And the red lightnings roll in orbs of fire, Or glance in arrowy flight, thou canst but feel The throb of selfish fear, then seek some fame Worthier of thy ambition, nor presume To bow before the shrine of Poetry! Does thy soul slumber when the rising lark Pours all his spirit in the full-voic'd song, A hymn of worship at the Eastern shrine Of Day's ascending God? and in thy heart Wakes there no answering music of sweet thoughts Of such strong power to steal thee from thyself That even the song of lark, the hum of bee, All Nature's harmonies of morning joy Seem, when thou wakest from the holy spell, But fragments of thy broken meditations, Or echoes to the minstrelsy within? If in the silence of the noon-day hour Thou dost not own serenity of soul, A spirit, that can love the quietude, And brood in joy upon the thousand forms That float unceasingly before its ken; If, when the robin warbles from her bough The latest accents of adoring love To yon fair star, that gilds the twilight trees, Thou canst not give a moral to her song; If, when the moon sheds her still sober light Upon this water, and deludes the eye With shew of motion, there is in thy heart No pulse of pleasure;âhence, for ever hence, Oh shun this bank! it is the POET'S HAUNT! THE EVERLASTING ROSE. I Hail to thy hues! thou lovely flower, Still shed around thy soft perfume, Still smile amid the wint'ry hour, And boast even now a springtide bloom. II In April's bower thy sweets are breath'd, And June beholds thy blossoms fair; In Autumn's chaplet thou art wreath'd, And round December's forehead bare. III The Summer lily sees thee blow, As high she rears her trembling head; And Winter boasts his flowers of snow, A contrast to thy lingering red. IV For thee the cuckow pours his voice, And thou dost see the swallow gay, The summer thrush bids thee rejoice, And wint'ry robin's sweeter lay. V Most soft, most lovely dost thou seem, 'Mid parching heat, 'mid nipping frost; And gathering beauty from each beam No hue, no grace of thine is lost. VI Thus Hope, 'mid life's severest days, Still smiles, still triumphs o'er despair; Alike she lives in Pleasure's rays, And cold Affliction's winter air. VII Alike she blooms in Science' bower, And in the rural cot she glows, The Poet's and the Lover's flower, The bosom's everlasting Rose! HOME. Haunts of my youthful days, tho' distant far, My spirit is with you! oh I could weep, Vex'd with the jarrings of this populous world, To think upon thy deep tranquillity, Mine own lov'd home! the struggles and the strife Of worthless ones, that sink into the heart, Turn'd all its blood to poison! I have thought Of thee, and I am calm: thy trees arose, Brightening before mine eye: the pleasantness That slumbers in thy valliesâthe soft hues That bathe thy sunny hillsâall met my soul; And, lovelier far than Nature's outward forms, The spirit of Domestic Happiness: The voice of her I lov'd was in my ear, She smil'd serenity, and I was calm. Even now I am no more the man I was When first I sat to meditate this song; For then the harsh rebuke, the bitter taunt, (Most harsh when issuing from Friendship's lips,) Still vex'd the ear, and sicken'd all the soul; Haunts of my childhood, now I think on you, And thoughts and feelings gush along my heart Sweet as the music of my native stream!â Feelings more holy never with the breeze Of Evening stole into the spirit of him Who plies his bark on Uri's lonely lake, And meditates on Tellâthe while he sees Darkening the wave beneath the fane which speaks The patriot's triumph, and his country's love: The tear is on his cheekâhis heart is fullâ A brighter tinge hath lit his streaming eye, With gentler sweep he draws the gliding oar, Fearful to break those shadows on the wave Which wake such deep, such sacred sympathies!â Haunts of my childhood, are ye still as fair As when I wander'd thro' each green recess? Still does the soft breeze with his gentle breath Stirring at once a thousand twinkling leaves Utter neglected music? Does the cloud, In whose dark womb the noon-day Sun is hid, Whose folds are lightly colour'd with his beams, Still hang as lovely in the silent sky? Is Nature still the same, altho' no more An eye is there, to hold deep intercourse With all her forms, altho' no heart is there To feel her power, and hymn her holiness? Oft have I thought some bond of mighty strength Had linked me in a strange identity With outward accidents of Natureâoft Methought some spell of more than human force âA most full quietness of strange delight âSuspended all my powers; I seem'd as tho' âDiffus'd into the scene.â âJoan of Arc, Book I. Had lull'd to rest my individual self, And that one soul inspir'd the scenes around, The spacious sky, the universal air, And him who gazed in rapture on the sight! And now in crowded city, oh how strange, How impious does this separation seem, From all I wish and loveâeven from myself! Yet have I oft-times held communion high And holy with the absent scenery That pleas'd me: oft with spirit most intense I brooded, till amid the silent soul Was heard the flow of waters, and the stir Of Summer leavesâtill every form I lov'd Was with meâtill I ceas'd to be alone. Dear are such visions to the thinking soul, And like in love as in their nature like To those fair forms, that, having past from earth, Return at twilight, and the musing man, Before whose eye they move, conceives their looks Chasten'd, refin'd, and purified by Death! Spirits, that oft on light and dewy wing Hover'd around the cradle of my childhood, Touching the dreaming infant's cheek with smiles, And, in the hours of my advancing age, Have, with such music as the unseen lark Oft sends into the morning traveller's soul, Pour'd strains of more than earthly melody In calm and awful accents to the heart, Breathing along those inward chords that thrill With unbid impulse to the Poet's lay; Spirits, ye have not yet deserted me; Ye have not left me, darkly wandering, Companionless, unguided, in a world I cannot mingle with! Conflicting men May rudely throw me from their noisy converse, Or stretch the hand of seeming brotherhood, And mock me with their love. Haunts of my youth, Ye will not mock me, and ye cannot change. SOLITUDE. AN ODE. This Poem was honoured with a Prize Medal by the Historical Society, T. C. D. 1814. Oh, what a lovely silent spot! 'Mid such a scene the eremite would hope To build his lowly cot, Just where with easy slope The wooded mountain bends, Where the clear rill descends Now hid the jutting rocks beneath, Now faintly sparkling on the eye, Itself conceal'd, its course we now descry By the long grass, and blossomy heath, By the cowslip's saffron hue, By the violet's clouded blue, Beside its fostering bed In waste profusion spread; Its widening wave at distance now we hail, Where bright, and blue, and broad, it rolls along the vale. Now turn and gaze on cliffs sublime, And see the goat laborious climb Where the clinging ivy grows, White are those cliffs with Winter snows, While spring-tide breezes gaily breathe, And bless the joyous vale beneath:â âAt Spring's return the earth is glad, And yet to me, at this lone hour, The wood-dove's note, from yonder natural bower, Tho' winning sweet, is sad; And there is sadness in the tone Of the robin, that alone Sings, as mourning o'er the dead, From the yew, whose branches throw Their shadows on the grave below, Whose leaves upon the grave are shed; The robin's notes, low-warbled o'er the tomb, Soothe, while they make me mourn, are sad, yet without gloom. In such a scene, when all around Wakes in the breast the Poet's flame, Whose glories shall the harp with warmth resound? SPIRIT, whate'er thy name, That, when no noisy cares intrude, Dost breathe 'mid nature's quietude, Bidding its charms with new-born lustre shine, Who givest to earth a livelier hue, To midnight skies a deeper blue, SPIRIT, no other hymn than thine Shall tremble from the The Irish harp. Clarshec's frame, Whose strings neglected long, Again shall echo to the song, Shall hail th'inspiring nymph, whose holy power Bids wisdom and delight to bless the lonely hour. See where most mild, most sad, The goddess on her mountain throne Of rocks, with many-coloured lichens clad, Is soothed by gurgling waters near, Or song of sky lark wild and clear, Or music's mellow tone: The scarce-heard hum of distant strife Gives to her lonely votary's breast An hallow'd calm of rest, Unruffled by the woes, above the mirth of life. Here Genius in fantastic trance Enjoys his wildest reverie, Or pores with anxious eye Upon some old romance, 'Till all the pomp of chivalry, The visor quaint, the armed knight, The princely dame, the tournay bright Are present to his glance;â And Fancy here delights to stray, And shed around her smiles serene, Not those alone that for the Poet play, Too grandly, too divinely bright, They pain with luxury of light!â Here she exerts a gentler sway, And consecrates to happiness the scene; She breathes with soft controul An holy sense of sober'd joy, And sorrows that no more annoy Are pleasant to the soul:â The breast that throbb'd before too much At Sorrow's wound, at Pleasure's touch, Indulging here in calm repose No change of shifting passions knows, Thus when the winds with wanton play Among the One side of the Alder's leaf is gray. Alder's branches stray, The twinkling leaves are seen Give to the light their lively gray, But when the breezes die away, They shine in softest green;â Oft, in that solemn silence of the breast, When passions pause, and all is peace within, There breathes a voice that cannot be represt, That speaks to man of holinessâof sin;â There breathes a voice the spirit to controul With warning power, unfelt 'mid Pleasure's mirth; Its accents are not of the earthâ 'Tis GOD that speaketh to the SOUL! Who hath not felt in some lone hour Feelings sublimely sad Steal o'er his spirit with resistless power? Go! seek that man among the bad, Go, seek him 'mid the heartless throng Whom courtly luxury calls her own, Bid him his worthless days prolong Where thoughtless Pleasure haunts the throne; Yet will there come an hour to him When anguish in his breast shall wake, And that bright eye-ballâweak and dim, Gazing on former days, shall ache; When solitude bids visions drear Of raptures, now no longer dear, In gloomy ghastliness appearâ When thoughts arise of errors pastâ Of Vice, that Virtue's hopes could blastâ Of Passion's unresisted rageâ Of Youth, that thought not upon Ageâ Of earthly hopes, too fondly nurst, That caught the giddy eye at first, But, like the flowers of Arab sands, That wither'd in the closing hands. Blame not the silent monitress That thus the bosom would addressâ Blame not the guardian Spirit sent To call the guilty to repentâ Oh blame not her whose holy breath Inspires with hopes from Heaven the soul that starts at Death! Are we indeed in solitude alone? Are there not spirits hovering near The lonely mind to cheer, And breathe into the heart an holy tone? Hath not the Poet heard with ear entranc'd As, by some devious stream, He lay in strange romantic dream, Hath not he heard his harp faint echoing, As if an Angel's hand had glanc'd Along its every string? Have not the Dead, in such an hour as this, Bent from their homes of bliss, To tell the mourner that they do not sleep Within the grave's unbroken gloom, The damp, dull silence of the tomb, Oh come they not from Heaven to soothe the hearts that weep?â Say are we then alone in solitude? In Night's mid hour, when all around is still, When hush'd is every passion rude, What awful reveries the bosom fill! In such an hour the Prophet's tone hath woke On mortal's hallow'd lips, and on the eye Visions of other days have broke, Of days, that slumber still in deep futurity; Such sights, and sounds as met his eye and ear, When slept in Patmos' isle the solitary Seer. Say not that it is solitude When stands in loneliness the Good Amid surrounding enemiesâ When Pain, and Woe, and Malice rise, When Tyranny hath fixed his fate, Even then in that eventful hour Shall Virtue triumph still, and Power Shall envy him she still must hate! Was there when fearless Sidney fell No angel form to guard his cell? And when around the tyrant's throne The courtly sons of Flattery stood, Oh saw he then their pomp alone? Dwelt not his ear on Sidney's groan? Gaz'd not his eye on Sidney's blood? Oh heard he notâtho' Music's breath, Tho' rapture's voice his soul addressâ Oh heard he not a voice of Death, And all was loneliness? But Sidney, there were those who stood Around to guard thy solitude; And Martyr, there were thoughts of healing That on thy wounded spirit gleam, And many a proud and patriot feeling Is mingling with thy dream; Angelic hosts surround thee, and forbid The dew of selfish fear thine eye to cloud, Unseen they stand, as when his foes amid Elisha woke, and seem'd to Man's weak gaze Alone, till bursting from the tempest's shroud With cars, and arms of fire his seraph guardian blaze. II. Kings, chap. vi. verses 15â17. Oh thou, whose influence breathes thro' solitude SPIRIT, whate'er thy name, With all thy warmth inflame A breast, that long in no unholy mood The loveliness of Nature's charms hath wooed; Long with no idle gaze mine eye hath view'd The beauteous scene of earth, and sea, and sky, But Wisdom lives in all that I descry;â All that I hear is speaking to my breast, The thunder's crash, the lark's enlivening lay, All Nature's sights and sounds, or sad or gay, Dwell in my soul, indelibly imprest; Even now, the view of yonder ruinous tower, Whose fissur'd walls admit the moon's cold beams, Sheds on my bosom melancholy dreams Most suited to the sober hour; Mine eye beholds those early days, When shining in the pride of power They burst upon the gaze;â But soon like Man the turret falls, The pilgrim mourns beneath its walls, Sees o'er its strength the wild flower rise, Hears from its heights the night-bird's cries, And, musing sadly, learns to scan The vice and vanity of Man;â But from this lonely dream of earth What feelings spring to sudden birth; No more the pilgrim looks beneath, For him new hopes, new raptures breathe, The soul beholds new worlds before it rise, Soars from the mists of earth, and communes with the skies!
