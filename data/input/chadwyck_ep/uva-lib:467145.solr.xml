      <field name="fulltext">TO ALFRED AUSTIN PRELUDE (TO ?) “Supra un munti sparman stu bellu ciuri! Chistu è lu ciuri di la tò billizza” (Sicilian Canzuno). In a grove of ilex Of oak and of chestnut, Far on the sunswept Heights of Tusculum, There groweth a blossom, A snow-white bloom, Which many have heard of, But few have seen. Oft bright as the morning, Oft pale as moonlight, There in the greenness, In shadow and sunshine It grows, awaiting The hand that shall pluck it: For this blossom springeth From the heart of a poet And of her who loved him In the long ago, Here on the sunswept Heights of Tusculum. And them it awaiteth, Deep lovers only, Kindred of those Who loved and passioned There, and whose hearts-blood Wrought from the Earth This marvellous blossom, The Shadow-Lily, The Flower of Dream. Few that shall see it, Fewer still Those that shall pluck it: But whoso gathers That snow-white blossom Shall love for ever, For the passionate breath Of the Shadow-Lily Is Deathless Joy: And whoso plucks it, keeps it, treasures it, Has sunshine ever About the heart, Deep in the heart immortal sunshine: For this is the gift of the snow-white blossom, This is the gift of the Flower of Dream. SUSURRO. Breath o' the grass, Ripple of wandering wind, Murmur of tremulous leaves: A moonbeam moving white Like a ghost across the plain: A shadow on the road: And high up, high, From the cypress-bough, A long sweet melancholy note. Silence. And the topmost spray Of the cypress-bough is still As a wavelet in a pool: The road lies duskily bare: The plain is a misty gloom: Still are the tremulous leaves; Scarce a last ripple of wind, Scarce a breath i' the grass. Hush: the tired wind sleeps: Is it the wind's breath, or Breath o' the grass. HIGH NOON AT MIDSUMMER ON THE CAMPAGNA. High noon, And from the purple-veilèd hills To where Rome lies in azure mist, Scarce any breath of wind Upon this vast and solitary waste, These leagues of sunscorch'd grass Where i' the dawn the scrambling goats maintain A hardy feast, And where, when the warm yellow moonlight floods the flats, Gaunt laggard sheep browse spectrally for hours While not less gaunt and spectral shepherds stand Brooding, or with hollow vacant eyes Stare down the long perspectives of the dusk. Now not a breath: No sound; No living thing, Save where the beetle jars his crackling shards, Or where the hoarse cicala fills The heavy heated hour with palpitant whirr. Yet hark! Comes not a low deep whisper from the ground, A sigh as though the immemorial past Breathed here a long, slow, breath? Lost nations sleep below; an empire here Is dust; and deeper, deeper still, Dim shadowy peoples are the mould that warms The roots of every flower that blooms and blows: Even as we, too, bloom and fade, Frail human flowers, who are so bitter fain To be as the wind that bloweth evermore, To be as this dread waste that shroudeth all In garments green of grass and wilding sprays, To be as the Night that dies not, but forever Weaves her immortal web of starry fires; To be as Time itself, Time, whose vast holocausts Lie here, deep buried from the ken of men, Here, where no breath of wind Ruffles the brooding heat, The breathless blazing heat Of Noon. FIOR DI MEMORIA. “? ed ogni vento Che passa accoglie sulle tepidi ali I sospiri d'amor di mille rose”. Enrico Nencioni. From the swamp the white mist stealeth, Wendeth slowly through the grasses, Like a long lithe snake it circleth Breathing from its mouth its poison, Breathing fumes of the malaria. Up the grassy slope it passeth, Is a snake no more but changes To a thin white veil of smoke-drift, White as when the warm Scirocco Blows across wet meadows gleaming In the sudden glare of sunshine. Thin and white upon the uplands; Dappled, soft, as windblown swans-down, In the sudden dips and hollows. In the hollow where the ruins, Immemorial ruins, columns, Prostrate all, with strange devices, Sculptured 'neath the yellow lichen, In the hollow where the ruins Lie as when the earthquake shook them From their ancient stately beauty Long ere Rome had gathered slowly Round the sacred fane of Saturn, There the grass is tall as wild-rice, Tall as is the wind-waved bulrush Rustling by the Tiber-marshes. Nought is seen around but grasses, Flower-filled grasses, lizard-haunted, Musical with many whisperings And the loud crescendo humming Of the wild-bees coming, going, And the myriad things that flitter, Breathe, and gleam, and swift evanish Mid these tortuous dim savannahs, These gigantic grass-stem forests. Nought above, but the blue hollow With its infinite depths of azure. Nought to meet the wandering vision But the ruins mid the grasses, But the windied grasses swaying Up and billowing o'er the margins Of the lone mist-haunted hollow, But the wide deep dome of purple, Cloudless, speckless, save when darkling For a moment drifts a shadow Far in the aerial distance, Though no sound is borne earthward Of the scream of that wild eagle Whirling from his Volscian eyrie. Where the green gloom of the grasses Turns at noon to amber dayshine, There the fallen ruins are covered With a wilderness of roses: Roses, roses, in such masses That the fangless snakes which wander Deep within their fragrant coverts Sink and rise and glide and vanish As though swimming in sweet waters Where each wavelet curdles rosily To a blossoming bud or floateth Calmly as a smooth soft rose-leaf. Oh, the wilderness of roses Shrouding all the fallen columns, All the mossy lichened marbles: Crimson depths of fluctuant sweetness, Carmine, pink, some wanly yellow As young lime-leaves in the dawnlight, Some as ivory of India Deftly wrought by patient fingers In the dim mysterious ages; Others wan as surf in starlight, Dusky white as coral garnered In the deeps where light a dream is, Ruffling the swart glooms of Ocean: But damask most, or crimson, blood-red, Flushed as wine-stained, or as dawn-clouds. Mass on mass of tangled roses, Blossom-flames, or multitudinous Plumes of those lost birds of Eden Which, as in long roseate vapours, With a myriad wings waft upward Each new morn, and with the sunrise Earthward sweep on glowing pinions, Till they wheel and fade and vanish On their endless quest of Eden. One vast crimson flood of roses, Whence a carven stone or column Reareth sometimes as a boulder Swart upborne o'er sunset-waters. Oh the fragrance when the south-wind, When the languorous Scirocco Breathes with tepid breath upon them, And with idle feet strays lightly O'er and o'er their billowy sweetness. Nought but this flushed sea of roses, And the green gloom of the grasses Shrouding the forgotten ruins In the lone mist-haunted hollow, Lost, unseen, but domed in splendour By the depths of purple azure. Lo, amidst the roses' tangle What white sunlit beauty shineth? Some stone goddess, nymph, or naiad, Carven in the bygone ages, Wan as ivory now, and glowing With the multitudinous breaths of sunlight? Nay, no marble this that gleameth Ivory-white among the roses, For the naked flesh moves gently With the breath that rising, falling, Scarcely stirs the fluttered rose-leaves. O wild mountain-girl, whom never Lover yet has won with passion, But whose arms have claspt the hill-wind, But whose swelling breast has quivered 'Neath the soft south-wind's caresses, Whose white limbs have felt the kisses Of the wandering wind, thy lover: O wild mountain-girl, sleep ever, Naked there in all thy beauty Mid the sea of clustering roses, Lost within the green-glooms tender Of the wind-swayed desert-grasses. Dark thy cloud of hair about thee, Dark thy shadowy eyes that dream Far into the azure distance: White thy limbs as sunlit ivory, With stray roseleaves scattered o'er them, With thy sea of roses round thee. What strange dreams are thine, O Goddess— Goddess, surely, for beyond thee Sways a cloud of fluttering sparrows: Ah, is it thou—nay, never goddess Now to mortal man discloseth That serene immortal beauty, Which is as a draught of rapture Fraught with bitterness and sorrow: I have tasted, quaffed it, Goddess, For the soul can know and see thee, For the soul can woo and win thee, Thee, even thee, O Beautiful! I have drunk its perilous rapture, Knowing all have quaffed and feared not, And have known the bitter savour: Yet, would drink again, O Goddess! Nay, no goddess here, but only, Naked, dreaming in the sunshine, Ivory-white among the rose-leaves, With her dark hair thrown about her Like the dusk about the morning, Only a wild mountain-girl, Filled with secret springs of passion, Immemorial seeds of passion Wrought at last through generations In this perfect flower of beauty To a strange unspeakable longing. In a blaze of heat the sunlight, Fierce with torrid fires of Junetide, Beats upon her white limbs gleaming In the sunlit flames of roses: But she moves not, though a quiver Ofttimes passes like a tremor Shimmering through the furthest eastward Ere the stars grow suddenly paler. O wild mountain-girl, sleep ever, Naked there in all thy beauty Mid the sea of clustering roses: Deep within thy sea of roses Sink to slumber, sweeter, deeper, Where no waking is, but dreams are Changed to roses that shall hide thee, That shall hide thee and enshroud thee There within thy grassy hollow: Where the winds alone shall call thee, And the marish-mist shall wander Like a ghost between the grasses, In among the buried columns Lost within thy ruin of roses. THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ACQUA PAOLA. Not where thy turbid wave Flowing Maremma-ward, Moves heavily, Tiber, Through Rome the Eternal, Not there her music, not there her joy is: But rather where the tall pines On the Janiculum heights Sing their high song, with deeper therein, like an echo Heard in a mountain-hollow where cataracts break, A sound as of surge and of foaming: Yes, there where the echoing pines Whisper to high wandering winds The rush and the surge and the splendour Where the Acqua Paola thunders Into its fount gigantic, With noise like a tempest cleaving With mighty wings The norland forests. From dayspring, yellow and green And gray as a swan's breastfeather, To sunset's amber and gold And the white star of dusk, And through the moonwhite hours Till only Hesperus hangs His quivering tremulous disc O'er the faint-flushed forehead of Dawn— All hours, all days, forever Surgeth the singing flood, With chant and paean glorious, With foam and splash and splendour, A music wild, barbaric, That calleth loud over Rome, Laughing, mocking, rejoicing: The sound of the waves when Ocean Laughs at the vanishing land And, fronting her shoreless leagues, Remembers the ruined empires That now are the drift and shingle In cavernous hollows under Her zone of Oblivion, Silence that nought shall break, Eternal calm. Foam, spray and splendour Of rushing waters, Gray-blue as the pale blue dome That circleth the morning star While still his fires are brighter Than the wanwhite fire of the moon. Foam, spray, and surge Of rushing waters! O the hot flood of sunshine Yellowly pouring Over and into thee, jubilant Fountain: Thy cataracts filled With vanishing rainbows, Shimmering lights As though the Aurora's Wild polar fires Flashed in thy happy bubbles, died in thy foam. Ever in joyous laughter Thy wavelets are dancing, Little waves with crests bright with sunlight Tossing their foamy arms, Laughing and leaping, Whirling, inweaving, Rippling at last and sleepily laving The mossed stone-barriers That clasp them round. Bright too and joyous, They, in the moonshine, When the falling waters Are as wreaths of snow Falling for ever Down mountain-flanks, Like melting snows In the high hill-hollows Seen from the valleys And seeming to fall, To fall forever A flower of water, Silent, and stirred not By any wind. Bright too and joyous In darkling nights, When the moon shroudeth Her face in a veil Of cloudy vapours, Or, like a flower I' the wane of its beauty, Droopeth and falleth Till lost to sight, Stoopeth and fadeth Into the dark— Or when like a sickle Thin and silvern She moveth slowly Through the starry fields, Moveth slowly Mid the flowers of the stars In the harvest-fields Of Eternity: Bright too and joyous, For then the shadows Play with the foam-lights, With the flying whiteness, And snowy surging. But brighter, more joyous, Save when the moon-flower In all her splendour Floats on thy bosom, Or, rather, dreameth Deep in the heart of thee O happy Fountain: Brighter, more joyous, Thee, when amidst thee, Strewn through thy waters, The stars are sown As seed multitudinous, As silvern seed In thy shadowy-furrows: Seed of the skiey flowers That in the heavens Bloom forever, Blossoms and blooms of Eternal splendour. Then is thy joy most, O jubilant Fountain, Then are thy waters Sweetest of song, Then do thy waters Surge, leap, rejoicing, Lave, and lapse slowly To haunted stillness And darkling dreams: Then is thy music rarest, Wildest and sweetest Music of Rome— Rome the Eternal, Through whose heart of shadow Moveth slowly Flowing Maremma-ward Thy murmur, Tiber, Thy muffled voice, Whom none interpreteth But boding, ominous, Is as the sound of Murmurous seas Heard afar inland— There, where Maremma-ward Flowing heavily, Moveth, Tiber, Thy turbid wave. PRIMO SOSPIRO DI PRIMAVERA. (Noon: First of February: On the Corsini Terraces on the Janiculum). Boom! The gun has thundered forth the hour of Noon! High upon the wings of Tramontana Swells a storm of bells, From a thousand churches, convents, buildings, Clanging, jangling, intermingling, Softened to a joyous music Borne upward by the wind To the heights already sounding With the surge of the three fountains Of the Acqua Paola torrent, To the heights already echoing With the Tramontana's challenge Tossed with reckless glee and laughter Through the ilexes and stone-pines. What a sound as of the ocean When the tides are driving inland, And the rampant waves are leaping Swift before the scourging sea-wind! And through all the windy tumult How the bells go wildly echoing, Like a storm of voices calling Far o'er mist-beleaguered waters. Suddenly silence: even the wind swings For a brief space skyward, chasing The last flying ragged cloudlets: Then from out the ilex-avenue Rings with palpitant, thrilling rapture, Clear and sweet, the first spring-music Of the speckle-breasted storm-thrush! Swish-sh-sh! the wind again, the medley Of its strong wings beating wildly, Spray-wet, filled with piny odours. Silence where the herald-thrush first Took the break of Spring with rapture. Yet what song in all the springtide Shall be sweeter, rarer, wilder, Than the sudden burst of music, Sung from utter joy and wonder Ere the earliest limes have budded: Than that momentary outburst When the bells of noon had fallen To an ebbing tide of music Down the sounding shores of Roma, And the turbulent Tramontana Had far skyward swept, with pinions Hawk-like spread to swoop upon the Flying drifts of ragged cloudlets! O the bells of Rome, the clamour Of the joyous Tramontana, O the wildness of thy music, Rapturous thrush, last Spring remembering, With thy lost voice freed one moment From its long forlorn silence! Spring is here—and Rome—together! CLOUDS. (Agro Romano) As though the dead cities Of the ancient time Were builded again In the heights of heaven, With spires of amber And golden domes, Wide streets of topaz and amethyst ways; Far o'er the pale blue waste, Oft purple-shadowed, Of the Agro Romano, Rises the splendid City of Cloud. There must the winds be soft as the twilight Invisibly falling when the daystar has wester'd; There must the rainbows trail up through the sunlight, So fair are the hues on those white snowy masses. Mountainous glories, They move superbly; Crumbling so slowly, That none perceives when The golden domes Are sunk in the valleys Of fathomless snow, Or when, in silence, The loftiest spires Fade into smoke, or as vapour that passeth When the hot breath of noon Thirsts through the firmament. Beautiful, beautiful, The City of Cloud, In splendour ruinous, With golden domes, And spires of amber, Builded superbly In the heights of heaven. A DREAM AT ARDEA. (Maremma) Where Ardea, the cliff-girt, Looks to the Sea, Dreaming forever In her desert place Of her vanished glory— There too in the tall grass, Starred with narcissus And the flaming poppy, I dreamed a dream. Not of the days when The fierce trumpeting Of the Asian elephants Made the wild horses Snort in new terror, Snort and wheel wildly, Till o'er the Campagna They passed like a trail Of vanishing smoke. No, nor when The brazen clarions Of the Roman legion Summoned the hill-folk To the Punic War: Nor yet when the shadow Of the falling star Of the House of Tarquin Swept unseen o'er the banquet, And none, foreseeing, Drew forth the pure sword For the foul heart of Sextus. Nor yet of the ancient days When the fierce Rutuli Laughed at the boasting of The seven-hilled city, And when on rude altars White victims lay, To appease the anger Of barbarian Gods— Nay, not of these, not even the far-off, The ancient time, when the mother of Perseus, Danaë the beautiful, came hither and builded Close to the sea the hill-town which standeth Now amid leagues of the inland grasses, White with the surf of the blossoming asphodels— Nay, but only Of the shrine of her, Venus, the Beautiful One, The Well-Beloved. Lost, it lieth Deep mid the tangle, Deep 'neath the roots of the flowers and the grasses Drawn like a veil o'er The face of Maremma. Only the brown lark Singing above it, Only the grey hare Beneath the wild olive, Only the linnet aflit in the myrtle, Only the spotted snake Writhing swiftly O'er the thyme and the spikenard, Only the falcon Dusking a moment the gold of the yellow broom, Only the things of the air and the desert, Know where deep in the maze of the undergrowth Lieth the shrine of the sacred Goddess, The shrine of Venus. Up through the dark blue mist of the harebells— All the wild glory, with trailing convolvulus, Lenten lilies asway in the sunlight, Wine-dark anemones, pasque-flowers of ruby, Iris and daffodil and sweet smelling violet, And high over all the white and gold shining Where the wind raced o'er the asphodel meadows: All the flower-glory of Spring in Maremma, But here, just here, a mist of the harebells— Up through the dark blue mist of the harebells Rose like a white smoke hovering gently Over the windless woodlands of Ostia Where the charcoal-burners wander like shadows, Rose a white vapour, stealthily, slowly. Ah, but the wonder! the wan ghost of Venus Rose slowly before me: Dark, deep, and awful the eyes of the vision, Sad beyond words that wraith of dead beauty, Chill now and solemn, Austere as the grave, The face that had blanched The high gods of old, The face that had led The heroes of men From the heights of Caucasus To the uttermost ends Of Earth, as leadeth nightly The Moon, her cohorts Of perishing billows. “I am she whom thou lovest”: “Nay, whom I worship, Goddess and Queen!” “I am she whom thou worshippest”: “For thou art Beauty, and Beauty I worship, “And thou art Love, and Love— “Love is Beauty. They love not nor worship, “They who dissever the one from the other”. “Hearken, O Goddess!” “Nay, shadow of shadows, why callest me Goddess! Far from thy world “the Goddess” is banished. Ye have chosen the dark: the dark be with you! Ye have chosen sorrow: and sorrow is yours: O fools that worship vain Gods, and know not That life is the breath but of perishing dust— They only live in whose hearts there hath fallen The breath of my passion— “O Goddess, fade not!” “I pass, and behold, With my passing goeth The joy of the world!” Darkly austere The face of the Goddess. Then like a flame That groweth wan And flickereth forth from the reach of vision, The face of Venus Was seen no more, Though through the mist Her eyes gleamed darkly, Great fires of joy— Of joy disherited, But glorious ever In their lordly scorn, Their high disdain. Not till the purple-hued Wings of the twilight Waved softly downward From the Alban hills, And moved stilly Over the vast dim leagues of Maremma, Turned I backward My wandering steps. Far o'er the white-glimmering Breast of the Tyrrhene Sea (Laid as in sleep at the feet of the hills) Rose, dropping liquid fires Into the wine-dark vault of the heaven, The Star of Evening, Venus, the Evening Star: Eternal, serene, In deathless beauty Revolving ever Through the stellar spheres! High o'er the shadowy heights Of the Volscian summits The full moon soared: Soared slowly upward Like a golden nenuphar In a vaster Nilus Than that which floweth Through the heart of Egypt. The moon that maketh The world so beautiful, That moveth so tenderly Over desolate things, The moon that giveth The amber light, Wherein best blossom The mystic flowers Of human love. Through the darkness Whelming the waste, And, like a stealthy tide Rising around Ardea, the cliff-girt, Wavered the sound of joyous laughter. Sweet words and sweeter Fell where the lentisc Bloomed, and the rosemary: Loving caresses Lost in a rustle Where the hawthorn-bushes Loomed large in the twilight Of the fireflies' lanterns. Deep in the heart of A myrtle-thicket A nightingale stirred: With low sweet note, Thrilling strangely, And as though moving With the breath of its passion The midmost leaves. But once her plaint:— Then wild and glad, In a free ecstasy, In utter bliss, In one high whirl of rapture, sang His answering song Her mate, low swaying upon a bough, With throat full-strained, and quivering wings Beating with tremulous whirr. Then I was glad, For surely I knew I had dreamed a dream neath the spell of Maremma. Not sunk in the drift Of antique dust, Lost from the ken of Earth Within her shrine, Venus, the Beautiful, The Queen of Love! But though no longer Beheld of man, Still living and breathing Through the heart of the world— Whether in the song, Passionate, beautiful, Of the nightingale; Or in the glad rapture Of lovers meeting, With soft caresses Hid in the dusk; In the fair flower of the vast field of heaven; Or in the glow, The pulsing splendour, Of the white star of joy, The Star of Eve. RED POPPIES. (In the Sabine valleys near Rome) Through the seeding grass, And the tall corn, The wind goes: With nimble feet, And blithe voice, Calling, calling, The wind goes Through the seeding grass, And the tall corn. What calleth the wind, Passing by— The shepherd-wind? Far and near He laugheth low, And the red poppies Lift their heads And toss i' the sun. A thousand thousand blooms Tost i' the air, Banners of joy, For 'tis the shepherd-wind Passing by, Singing and laughing low Through the seeding grass And the tall corn. THE WHITE PEACOCK. Here where the sunlight Floodeth the garden, Where the pomegranate Reareth its glory Of gorgeous blossom; Where the oleanders Dream through the noontides; And, like surf o' the sea Round cliffs of basalt, The thick magnolias In billowy masses Front the sombre green of the ilexes: Here where the heat lies Pale blue in the hollows, Where blue are the shadows On the fronds of the cactus, Where pale blue the gleaming Of fir and cypress, With the cones upon them Amber or glowing With virgin gold: Here where the honey-flower Makes the heat fragrant, As though from the gardens Of Gulistân, Where the bulbul singeth Through a mist of roses, A breath were borne: Here where the dream-flowers, The cream-white poppies Silently waver, And where the Scirocco, Faint in the hollows, Foldeth his soft white wings in the sunlight, And lieth sleeping Deep in the heart of A sea of white violets: Here, as the breath, as the soul of this beauty Moveth in silence, and dreamlike, and slowly, White as a snow-drift in mountain-valleys When softly upon it the gold light lingers: White as the foam o'the sea that is driven O'er billows of azure agleam with sun-yellow: Cream-white and soft as the breasts of a girl, Moves the White Peacock, as though through the noontide A dream of the moonlight were real for a moment. Dim on the beautiful fan that he spreadeth, Foldeth and spreadeth abroad in the sunlight, Dim on the cream-white are blue adumbrations, Shadows so pale in their delicate blueness That visions they seem as of vanishing violets, The fragrant white violets veined with azure, Pale, pale as the breath of blue smoke in far woodlands. Here, as the breath, as the soul of this beauty, White as a cloud through the heats of the noontide Moves the White Peacock. THE SWIMMER OF NEMI. (The Lake of Nemi: September) White through the azure, The purple blueness, Of Nemi's waters The swimmer goeth. Ivory-white, or wan white as roses Yellowed and tanned by the suns of the Orient, His strong limbs sever the violet hollows; A shimmer of white fantastic motions Wavering deep through the lake as he swimmeth. Like gorse in the sunlight the gold of his yellow hair, Yellow with sunshine and bright as with dew-drops, Spray of the waters flung back as he tosseth His head i' the sunlight in the midst of his laughter: Red o'er his body, blossom-white mid the blueness, And trailing behind him in glory of scarlet, A branch of the red-berried ash of the mountains. White as a moon-beam Drifting athwart The purple twilight, The swimmer goeth— Joyously laughing, With o'er his shoulders, Agleam in the sunshine The trailing branch With the scarlet berries. Green are the leaves, and scarlet the berries, White are the limbs of the swimmer beyond them, Blue the deep heart of the still, brooding lakelet, Pale-blue the hills in the haze of September, The high Alban hills in their silence and beauty, Purple the depths of the windless heaven Curv'd like a flower o'er the waters of Nemi. AL FAR DELLA NOTTE. Hark! As a bubbling sount That suddenly wells And rises in tall spiral waves and flying spray, The high, sweet, quavering, throbbing voice Of the nightingale! Not yet the purple veil of dusk has fallen, But o'er the yellow band That binds the west The vesper star beats like the pulse of heaven. Up from the fields The peasants troop, Singing their songs of love: And oft the twang of thin string'd music breaks High o'er the welcoming shouts, The homing laughter. The whirling bats are out, And to and fro The blue swifts wheel Where, i' the shallows of the dusk, The grey moths flutter Over the pale blooms Of the night-flowering bay. Softly adown the slopes, And o'er the plain, Ave Maria Solemnly soundeth. The long day is over. Dusk, and silence now: And Night, that is as dew On the Flower of the World. THISTLEDOWN. (Spring on the Campagna) Bloweth like snow From the grey thistles The thistledown: And the fairy-feathers O' the dandelion Are tossed by the breeze Hither and thither: Over the grasses, The seeding grasses Where the poppies shake And the campions waver, And where the clover, Purple and white, Fills leagues with the fragrance Of sunsweet honey; Hither and thither The fairy-feathers O' the dandelion, And white puff-balls O' the thistledown, Merrily dancing, Light on the breeze, Wheeling and sailing, And laughing to scorn The butterflies And the moths of azure; Blowing like snow Or foam o' the sea, Hither and thither Upward and downward. Now for a moment A thistledown On a white ball resteth, Sunbleached and hollow; A human skull Of the ancient days, When Sabines and Latins Made all the land here As red with blood As it now is scarlet With flaming poppies. Now the feathers, O' the dandelion, Like sunlit swansdown Long tost by the wind O'er the laughter of waters, Are blown like surf On a hidden rock— A broken arch Of a Roman temple, Where long, long ago, The swarthy priests Worshipped their Gods, The Gods now less than The very dust Whence the green grass springeth. But for a moment, then the wind takes them, Blows them, plays with them, Tosses them high through the gold of the sunshine, Wavers them upward, wavers them downward. Hither and thither among the white butterflies, Over and under the blue-moths and honey-bees, Over the leagues of blossoming clover, Purple and white, the sweet-smelling clover, Far o'er the grasses, And grey hanging thistles, Hither and thither Are floating and sailing The fairy-feathers O' the dandelion, Bloweth like snow The joy o' the meadows, The thistledown. THE TWO RUINS. A sea of moonlight. And in the sea an isle Black, rugged, tempest-torn, vast: O mighty Colosseum More grand in this thy ruin Than when proud Caesar smiled, and all thy walls Rang with tumultuous acclaim, While round thy dark foundations moaned A wind of alien pain. Terrible thou, O splendour of the Past. How great the Rome that knew thee, and how dread. Proud Roman, thine inheritance Is as a deathless crown, Yea, as a crown deep-set upon the brows, The unfurrowed front of Time that is to be. Hark, that low whine! What crippled thing is this, This spume of vice, This wreck of high estate? What ruin this that rises gaunt and wild: Thou, thou art Rome, the Past, The Rome that is! Not here a venerable age, But dull decay, Slow death, and utter weariness. Yon vast forlorn walls are but the frozen surf Of tides long ages ebbed: In thee Ruin is, in thee and such as thee. THE SHEPHERD. (Near the Theatre of Marcellus: Piazza Montanara) Solitary he stands, Clad in his goat-skins, Though all about him The busy throng Cometh and goeth. Overhead, the vast ruin, Wind-worn, time-wrought, Gloomily rises. Scarce doth he note it, Yet doth it give him The touch of nearness, Which the soul craves for In alien places: As the strayed mariner, Yearning, far inland, For sight of the sea, Smiles when he fingers a rope, or Heareth the wind Surge round the hedgerows As erst through the cordage; Or, on the endless, dusty, white high-road, Puts his ear to the pole Vibrating with song, as the mast Erewhile rang with the hum Of the hurricane. What doth he here, Away from the pastures On the desolate Campagna? From his haggard face Sorrowfully his wild black eyes Stare on the weariness, The noise, and hurry, And surge of the traffic. Sometimes, a faint smile Flitteth athwart his face, When a woman, from the well, Passeth by with a conca Poised on her head: Thus oft hath he seen The peasant girls In the little hamlets Far out on the plain: Or when a wine-cart With its tall cappoto A-swing like a high tent windswayed sidewise, Rattles in from the Appian highway, White with the dust of the Alban hills. What doth he here, He in whose eyes are The passion of the desert: He in whose ears rings The free music Of the winds that wander Through the desert-ruins? Not here, O Shepherd, Would'st thou fain dwell, Though in the Holy City God's Regent lives: Better the desolate waste, Better the free lone life, For there thou can'st breathe, There silence abideth, There, not the Regent, But God himself Dwelleth and speaketh. ALL'ORA DELLA STELLA. (Bells of Evening) Ring the bells of evening, through the gathering dusk; Ring the bells upon the plain; Rings the bell from out the tower against the light, Black against the west aflame, against The sea of deepening orange, purple, yellow (O the pale green cowslip-yellow where the crows Fly swiftly from the dim Campagna homeward); Ring the bells from out the little chapel yonder, In the tiny hill-town nestling on its craggy steep. From this lonely height where, half forgotten, Life still lingers in unvarying round, Can they ring away the evil sloth that broodeth As a bat gigantic broodeth over The low-breathing bust wherefrom it draws the life-blood? Can they ring away the dark and stagnant vapours That abide with men, here, on this height— On this height now flaming in the sunset Like a vast carbuncle on a burning desert? Ring, O ring, O bells, ring, ring, Not for peace, or rest that sweet is, Not for happy glooms and tender, But for storm and tempest rather, For a fierce and surging tempest That shall wake the mountain-hollows With the cry of Life arising! Rings the solitary bell upon the tower, Where the fever-stricken monks Kneel and pray: Where the monks within the black and lonely tower Dream that heaven lies yonder, Where through seas of wondrous living yellow The star of eve swims forth in silvern fire: Ah, the heaven that dwelleth yonder! Ring, O solitary bell, thy vesper, Toll thy hymn of hopes that are as vapours, Vapours lit a moment with strange glory Ere they fade into the darkness following after! Ring the bells upon the plain, All along the misty, vague Campagna: Unseen hamlets in the hollows, lonely dwellings Where gaunt hermits kneel and mutter, Scattered villages, and ruined places Where the shepherd only sleeps and hears nought ever Save the wild wind sweeping o'er the grasses, Or the soft scirocco gliding stilly O'er the fallen columns, broken arches, Whereamong his sheep go wandering vaguely, Hears but these, or cry of hawk or raven, Nightjar swooping through the moonless dusk— Hears nought else, save in the lonely distance The fierce sheepdogs snarling as they watch and prowl. Softly, slow, the vesper bells are ringing For all desolate haunts upon the waste, For all dreary lives upon the lone Campagna, Lives now spent like spume from ebbing waters, Spume thrown waste to swelter in the sun, Spume cast up and left by ebbing waters. Ring the bells of evening through the gathering dusk: Ring the bells upon the plain, From the tower looming black against the light, From the hill-town all aflame upon its steep, Ring the bells: Clamorous voices they, loud prayers crying That of the perishing flames of sunset burning, Of these red and yellow flames swift-fading yonder, God will make new fires of sunrise splendid, God will recreate a glorious morning. THE MANDOLIN. Tinkle-trink, tinkle-trink, trinkle-trinkle, trink! Hark, the mandolin! Through the dusk the merry music falleth sweet. Where the fountain falls, Where the fountain falls all shimmering in the moonshine white, Tinkle-trink, tinkle-trink, trinkle-trinkle, trink! Where the wind-stirred olives quiver, Quiver, quiver, leaves a-quiver, White as silver in the moonlight but like bat-wings in the dusk, Where the great grey moths sail slowly Slowly, slowly, like faint dreams In the wildering woods of Sleep, Where no night or day is, But only, in dim twilights, the wan sheen Of the Moon of Sleep. Hark, the mandolin! Where the dark-coned cypress rises, Thin, more thin, till threadlike, wavering The last spray soars up as smoke, As a vanishing breath of incense, To the silent stars that glimmer In the veil of purple darkness, The deep vault of heaven that seemeth As a veil that falleth, A dark veil that foldeth gently The tired day-worn world, breathing stilly as a sleeping child. Hark, the mandolin: And a soft low sound of laughter! Tinkle-trink, tinkle-trink, trinkle-trinkle, trink! Hush: from out the cypress standing Black against the yellow moonlight What a thrill, what a sob, what a sudden rapture flung Athwart the dark! Passion of song! Silence again, save mid the whispering leaves The unquiet wind, that as the tide Cometh and goeth. Now one long thrilling note, prolonged and sweet, And then a low swift stir, A whirr of fluttering wings, And, in the laurels near, two nested nightingales! Loud, loud, the mandolin, Tinkle-trink, tinkle-trink, trinkle-trinkle, trink, Trink, trink, trinkle-trink! Through the fragrant silent night it draweth near, Ah, the low cry, the little laugh, the rustle: Tinkle-trink—hush, a kiss—tinkle-trink—hush—hush— Tinkle-trink, tinkle-trink, trinkle-trinkle, trink! Where the shadows massed together Make a hollow darkness, girt By the yellow flood of moonshine floating by, Where the groves of ilex whisper In the silence, fragrant, sweet, Where the ilexes are dreaming In their depths of darkest shadow, Move the fireflies slowly, Mazily inweaving, Interweaving, interflowing; Wandering fires, like little lanterns Borne by souls of birds and flowers Seeking ever resurrection In the gladsome world of sunshine; Seekly vainly through the darkness In beneath the ilex-branches Where the very moonshine faileth, And the dark gray moths wave wanly Flitting from the outer gloaming. Oh, the fragrance, and the mystery, and the silence! Where the fireflies, mid the ilex, Rise and fall, recross, inweave In an endless wavy motion, In a slow aerial dancing In a maze of little flames In and out the ilex-branches: Hush! the mandolin! Louder still, and louder, louder: Ah, the happy laugh, and rustle, Rustle, rustle, Ah the kiss, the cry, the rapture. Silence, where the ilex-branches Loom out faintly from their darkness Where, slow-wandering flames, the fireflies Rise and fall, recross, inweave In an endless wavy motion, In a slow aerial dancing. Silence: not a breath is stirring: Not a leaflet quivers faintly. Silence: even the bats are silent Wheeling swiftly through the upper air, Where the gnat's thin shrilling music Fades into the flooding moonlight: Hush, low whispered words and kisses, Hush, a cry of pain, of rapture. Not a sound, a sound thereafter, But a low sweet sigh of breathing, And, from out the flowering laurel, Just a twittering breath of music, Just a long-drawn pulsing note Of a sweet and passionate answer. Silence: hark, a stir—low laughter— Whispered words—and rustle—rustle— Trink—trink—the mandolin! Hark, it trinkles down the valley, Trink-trink, trinkle-trink, trinkle-trink! Past the cistus, blooming whitely, Past the oleander-bushes, Past the ilexes and olives, Where the two tall pines are whispering With the sleepy wind that foldeth His tired pinions ere he sleepeth On the flood of amber moonlight. Wind o' the night, tired wind o' night— Tinkle-trink, trink, trinkle-trink, Trink, trinkle-trink, Trink! BAT-WINGS. Flitter, flitter, through the twilight, Pipistrello: Where the moonshine glitters Waver thy swart wings, Darting hither, thither, Swift as wheeling swallow. Where the shadows gather In and out thou flittest, Flitter, flitter, Waver, waver, Pipistrello. Thin thy faint aerial song is, Thin and fainter than the shrilling Of the gnats thou chasest wildly, But how delicately dainty— Thin and faint and wavering also, In the high sweet upper air, Where the gnats weave endless mazes In their pyramidal dances— And thy dusky wings go flutter, Flutter, flutter, Waver, waver, But without a sound or rustle Through the purple air of twilight. Flitter, flitter, flutter, flitter, Pipistrello. LA VELIA. (The Sea-Gull: Pontine Marshes) Here where the marsh Waves white with ranunculus, Where the yellow daffodil Flieth his banner In the fetid air, And oft mid the bulrushes Rustleth the porcupine Or surgeth the boar— Though bloweth rarely The fresh wind, The Tramontana, And only Scirocco Heavily lifts The feathery plumes the tall canes carry: What dost thou here, O bird of the ocean? Here, where the marshes Are never stirred By the pulse of the tides; Here where the white mists Crawl on the swamp, But never the rush and the surge of the billows? White as a snowflake thou gleamest, and passest: Drearier now the chill waste of the Stagno, Wearier now the dull silence and boding. Would that again Thy glad presence were gleaming Here where the marsh Steams white in the sunshine; For swift on my sight, As thy white wings wavered, Broke the sea in its beauty, With foam, and splendour Of rolling waves: And loud on my ears (O the longing, the yearning) When thy cry filled the silence, Came the surge of the sea And the tumult of waters. SPUMA DAL MARE. (On the Latin Coast) Flower o' the wave, White foam of the waters, The many-coloured: Here blue as a hare-bell, Here pale as the turquoise; Here green as the grasses Of mountain hollows, Here lucent as jade when wet in the sunshine, Here paler than apples ere ruddied by autumn. Depths o' the purple! Amethyst yonder, Yonder as ling on the hills of October, With shadows as deep, Where islets of sea-wrack Wave in the shallows, As the sheen of the feathers On the blue-green breast Of the bird of the Orient, The splendid peacock. Foam o' the waves, White crests ashine With a dazzle of sunlight! Here the low breakers are rolling through shallows, Yellow and muddied, the hue of the topaz Ere cut from the boulder; Save when the sunlight swims through them slantwise, When inward they roll Long billows of amber, Crowned with pale yellow And gray-green spume. Here wan gray their slopes Where the broken lights reach them, Dull gray of pearl, and dappled, and darkling, As when mid the high Northward drift of the clouds, Scirocco bloweth With soft fanning breath. Foam o' the waves, Blown blossoms of ocean, White flowers of the waters, The many-coloured. A WINTER EVENING. (An Hour after Nightfall, on Saturday January 17, 1891) [To E. W. R.] The wild wind in the pines Surgeth and moaneth, And the flying snow Whirls hither and thither, Tost from the sprays of the firs on the Pincio. Here, in the dim gloomy Via dell' Mura, Dark as a torrent in mountainous chasms, Not a breath of the tempest waves downward upon us: Sraight down the vast mighty walls hang in silence Ice-spears and ice-shafts, rigid, unyielding: Here all the snow-drift lies thick and untrodden, Cold, white, and desolate save where the red light Gleams from a window in yonder high turret. Loud mid the trees of the Medici gardens, Surgeth the wind, and over the Pincio Sweeps to the southward the drift of the snowstorm: Clear to the northward the wan wintry moonshine Showeth the last pines silent and moveless, Untouch'd by the wild sweeping wing of the tempest. Swift in the skies o'er the heights of the Vatican Flash upon flash, long pulsations of lightning, And borne afar from the distant Campagna The long low muttering growls of the thunder. Wild night of the tempest, with lightning and moonshine, Thunder afar and the surge of the snow-blast, The whisper of pines and the glimmer of starlight, The voice of the wind in the woods of Borghese, These, these together, and here in the darkness Here in the dim, gloomy Via dell' Mura, Nought but the peace of the snow-drift unruffled, Whitely obscure, save where from the window High in the walls of the Medici Gardens Glows a red shining, fierily bloodred. What lies in the heart of thee, Night, thus so ominous? What is thy secret, strange joy or strange sorrow? THE BATHER. Where the sea-wind ruffles The pale pink blooms Of the fragrant Daphne, And passeth softly Over the sward Of the cyclamen-blossoms, The Bather stands. Rosy white, as a cloud at the dawning, Silent she stands, And looks far seaward, As a seabird, dreaming On some lone rock, Poiseth his pinions Ere over the waters He moves like a vision On motionless wings. Beautiful, beautiful, The sunlit gleam Of her naked body, Ivorywhite mid the cyclamen-blossoms, A wave o' the sea mid the blooms of the Daphne. Blue as the innermost heart of the ocean The arch of the sky where the wood runneth seaward, Blue as the depths of the innermost heaven The vast heaving breast of the slow-moving waters: Green the thick grasses that run from the woodland, Green as the heart of the foam-crested billows Curving a moment ere washing far inland Up the long reach of the sands gleaming golden. The land-breath beareth Afar the fragrance Of thyme and basil And clustered rosemary; And o'er the fennel, And through the broom, It floateth softly, As the wind of noon That cometh and goeth Though none hearkens Its downy wings. And keen, the seawind Bears up the odours Of blossoming pinks And salt rock-grasses, Of rustling seaweed And mosses of pools Where the rosy blooms Of the sea-flowers open Mid stranded waves. As a water-lily Touched by the breath Of sunrise-glory, Moveth and swayeth With tremulous joy, So o'er the sunlit White gleaming body Of the beautiful bather Passeth a quiver. Rosy-white, as a cloud at the dawning, Poised like a swallow that meeteth the wind, For a moment she standeth Where the sea-wind softly Moveth over The thick pink sward of the cyclamen-blossoms. Moveth and rustleth With faint sussurrus The pale pink blooms Of the fragrant Daphne. AT VEII. (“Crown of Elruria”) Loud bloweth the tramontana O'er the uplands of Veii: Shrill through the grasses It whistles blithely, Tossing the thistle-foam Far o'er the pastures Where the goat-skinn'd shepherd Tendeth his sheep, And the high hawk, swooping, Drifteth his shadow From slope to slope. Here, when Rome lay Crouch'd in her hollows Where the Tiber lapped The Hill of Saturn, Veii the beautiful gleamed in the sunlight. Here, in the springs That bloomed as sweetly Two thousand years since, As now when the blackbird Calleth loudly Where the Cremera surgeth Through her hollow glen, And rainbows are woven Where the torrents vanish Over mossed ledges, White sheets of water With emerald hearts: Here, the Etrurian Banner waved proudly, Lordly and glorious, Sovereign ever From sea to sea. Here the proud hosts Laughed when the battle-cry Rang through the highways, And when from the towers Of Veii the mighty The herald-clarions Sent a wild blast On the wind of the morning, A tumult of summons To the flashing swords, And the merciless rain Of spears gleaming white As hail on the hill-sides. Here the fair city was decked as a maiden Led forth as a bride, With sunlit towers And banners yellow With virgin gold, And shrines of the holy ones Aflame in the sun, As the waters of ocean When the blossom of morning Swiftly unfolds in a myriad wavelets Leaping and laughing in shining splendour. Here now the dust bloweth Where the Gods stood proudly, Staring undaunted Through the shadows of Tiber: Here now the grasses Wave, where the banners Of ancient Etruria Tossed i' the sun: And where the clarions Of the heralds rang, The jay screameth From her swaying bough. Slowly the shepherd, Like the moving shadow Cast by the flock that followeth after, Wandereth, heedless, O'er the vast spaces: Nor dreameth ever Of what lies buried Beneath the waste, Though oft he wonders When his foot striketh A rusty spear-head; Or when, from the mould, A stone hand cometh, As though the dead Were stirring again Where now the windblown foam of the thistles Whitens the pastures of what was Veii. THE WILD MARE. Like a breath that comes and goes O'er the waveless waste Of sleeping Ocean, So sweeps across the plain The herd of wild horses. Like banners in the wind Their flying tails, Their streaming manes: And like spume of the sea Fang'd by breakers, The white froth tossed from their blood-red nostrils. Out from the midst of them Dasheth a white mare, White as a swan in the pride of her beauty: And, like the whirlwind, Following after, A snorting stallion, Swart as an Indian Diver of coral! Wild the gyrations, The rush and the whirl; Loud the hot panting Of the snow-white mare, As swift upon her The stallion gaineth: Fierce the proud snorting Of him, victorious: And loud, swelling loud on the wind from the mountains, The hoarse savage tumult of neighing and stamping Where, wheeling, the herd of wild horses awaiteth— Ears thrown back, tails thrashing their flanks or swept under— The challenging scream of the conqueror-stallion. AUGUST AFTERNOON IN ROME. (From the Trastevere) [To Théodore Roussel] Dull yellow shot with molten gold The Tiber flows. Beneath the walls the flood moves azurely, With purplish shadows where the bridge Spans triple-arch'd the stream: Brown on the hither bank an idle barge, With tawny sails still damp with spray Blown from Ligurian seas: And far, in the middle-flood, adrift, unoar'd, A narrow boat, swift-moving, black, Follows the flowing wave like a living thing. Full-flooded by the sun the houses lie Across the stream. Pale pink their walls, or touched to paler blue, But wanly yellow most, or soft as cream Brown-curdled in the heat. Oft, too, the tall facades asleep in the glow, Are dusk'd by violet shadows, delicate As the pale sheen of hyacinth-meadows where The hills are glad with April wandering by. Enmassed they stand, aglow, asleep: The green blinds closed, like folded leaves, Like ivy-leaves close-cluster'd to the pale white bark Of the tall Austral trees belov'd of those Who dwell where the Three Fountains rise from deathly soil. Hot in the yellow glare of the sun they stand, The myriad houses, with their infinite hues. The green blinds here loom dark: Here emerald-bright as the young grass that springs Beneath the blackthorn-blossoms snowing down. Brown-black the flat bare roofs, Save where, like floating flower-clouds, gardens glow High-perch'd mid perilous ravines of wall, With scarlet, orange, white, and fleeting gold. In the deserted streets no passer-by Throws a distorted phantom o'er the way, Though in the deep-blue shadow-side there drifts A trickling stream of life. Dim drowsy silence holds the day, for all The water-seller sounding hollowly His Fresca, acqua fresca, fred' e fresc'! Or melon-merchant shrilling loud and thin His long fantastic cry. Here, silence too: Only the long slow wash Of the dull wave of Tiber's murmurous flood. At times a far-off bell Clangs, And stillness comes again, as mists draw in. Only the muffled voice Of the wan, yellow, listless-moving stream— And, hark, from yonder osteria, dim in shade, The sudden, harsh, and dissonant jarring chords Of a loose-strung guitar, Twang'd idly for a few brief moments, e'er The half-sung song grows drowsier, and still. THE OLIVES OF TIVOLI. Grey as the swirl Of spindrift flying O'er windblown ice, Gleam the myriad leaves of the olives, When, surging from under, The wind leapeth And laughs amongst them. Like the sea when the tides Are lifting and rippling The restless wavelets Wandering shoreward, When over them breaketh In a glittering shining The flood of moonlight, So are the wind-twisted olives of Tivoli. Green as the grasses When Scirocco bloweth Palely upon them, The lower leaves: But soft and white As the down of an owlet, Or wan grey feathery plumes of the snow-flakes, The myriad upper Shimmering wings That wave like surf o'er the sea of the olives, When, surging from under, Where the plain darkles In purpling mist, The wind laughs As he leapeth among them. SCIROCCO. (June) Softly as feathers That fall through the twilight When wild swans are winging Back to the northward: Softly as waters, Unruffled, and tideless, Laving the mosses Of inland seas: Soft through the forest, And down through the valley, Light as a breath o'er the pools of the marish, Still as a moonbeam over the pastures, Goeth Scirocco. Warm his breath: The night-flowers know it, Love it, and open Their blooms for its sweetness: Warm the tender low wind of his pinions Scarce brushing together the spires of the grasses: Ah, how they whisper, the little green leaflets Black in the dusk or grey in the moonlight: Ah, how they whisper and shiver, the tremulous Leaves of the poplar, and shimmer and rustle When soft as a vapour that steals from the marshes The wings of Scirocco fan silently through them. Ofttimes he lingers By ruined nests Deep in the hedgerows, And bloweth a feather In little eddies, A yellow feather That once had fluttered On a breast alive with A rapture of song: But slowly ceaseth, And passeth sadly. Ofttimes he riseth Up through the branches Where the fireflies wander, Up through the branches Of oak and chestnut, And stirs so gently With sway of his wings That the leaves, dreaming, Think that a moonbeam Only, or moonshine, Moves through the heart of them. Upward he soareth Oft, silently floating Through the purple aether, Still as the fern-owl over the covert, Or as allocco haunting the woodland, Up to the soft curded foam of the cloudlets, The white dappled cloudlets the south-wind bringeth. There, dreaming, he moveth Or sails through the moonlight, Till chill in the high upper air and the silence, Slowly he sinketh Earthward again, Silently floateth Down o'er the woodlands: Foldeth his wings and slow through the branches Drifts, scarcely breathing, Till tired, mid the flowers or the hedgerows he creepeth, Whispers alow mid the spires of the grasses, Or swooning at last to motionless slumber Floats like a shadow adrift on the pastures. THE WIND AT FIDENAE. (To D. H. In Remembrance) Fresh from the Sabines, The Beautiful Hills, The wind bloweth. Down o'er the slopes, Where the olives whiten As though the feet Of the wind were snow-clad: Out o'er the plain Where a paradise Of wild blooms waveth, And where, in the sunswept Leagues of azure, A thousand larks are As a thousand founts Mid the perfect joy of The depths of heaven. Swift o'er the heights, And over the valleys Where the grey oxen sleepily stand, Down, like a wild hawk swooping earthward, Over the winding reaches of Tiber, Bloweth the wind! How the wind bloweth, Here on the steeps of Ancient Fidenae, Where no voice soundeth Now, save the shepherd Calling his sheep; And where none wander But only the cloud-shadows, Vague ghosts of the past. Sweet and fresh from the Sabines, Now as of yore, When Etruscan maidens Laughed as their lovers Mocked the damsels Of alien Rome, Sweet with the same young breath o' the world Bloweth the wind. SORGENDO LA LUNA. No sound, Save the hush'd breath, The slowly flowing, The long and low withdrawing breath of Rome. Not a leaf quivers, where the dark, With eyes of rayless shadow and moonlit hair, Dreams in the black And hollow cavernous depth of the ilex-trees. No sound, Save the hush'd breath of Rome, And sweet and fresh and clear The bubbling, swaying, ever quavering jet Of water fill'd with pale nocturnal gleams, That, in the broad low fount, Falleth, Falleth and riseth, Riseth and falleth, swayeth and surgeth, ever A spring of life and joy where ceaselessly The shadow of two sovran powers make A terror without fear, a night that hath no dark, Time, with his sunlit wings, Death, with his pinions vast and duskily dim: Time, breathing vanishing life: Death, breathing low From twilights of Oblivion whence Time rose A wild and wandering star forlornly whirled, Seen for a moment, ere for ever lost. Up from the marble fount The water leaps, Sways in the moonshine, springeth, springeth, Falleth and riseth, Like sweet faint lapping music, Soft gurgling notes of woodland brooks that wander Low laughing where the hollowed stones are green With slippery moss that hath a trickling sound: Leapeth and springeth, Singing forever A wayward song. While the vast wings of Time and Death drift slowly, While, faint and far, the tides of life Sigh in a long scarce audible breath from Rome, Or faintlier still withdraw down shores of dusk; For ever singing It leapeth and falleth: Falleth and leapeth, Falleth, And falleth. IN JULY. (South of Rome) Pale-rose the dust lying thick upon the road: Grey-green the thirsty grasses by the way. The long flat silvery sheen of the vast champaign Shimmers beneath the blazing tide of noon. The blood-red poppies flame Like furnace-breaths: Like wan vague dreams the misty lavender Drifts greyly through the quivering maze, or seems Thus through the visionary glow to drift. On the far slope, beyond the ruin'd arch, A grey-white cloudlet rests, The cluster'd sheep alow: close, moveless all, And silent, save when faintly from their midst A slumberous tinkle comes, Cometh, and goeth. Low-stretch'd in the blue shade, Beneath the ruin, The shepherd sleeps. Nought stirs. The wind moves not, nor with the faintest breath Toucheth the half-fallen blooms of the asphodels. Here only, where the pale pink ash Of the long road doth slowly flush to rose, A bronze-wing'd beetle moveth low, And sends one tiny puff of smoke-like dust Faint through the golden glimmer of the heat. THE NAKED RIDER. Through the dark gorge With its cliffs of basalt, The rider comes. The sunlight floodeth The breast of the hill, And all the mouth Of the sullen pass Is light with the foam of A thousand blooms Of the white narcissi, With a waving sea Of asphodels. On a white horse, A cream-white stallion With bloodied nostrils And wild dark eyes, The naked rider Laughs as he cometh, And hails the sunlight breaking upon him. Full breaks the flood Of the yellow light On the naked youth, Glowing, as ivory In the amber of moonrise In the violet eves Of August-tides. Dark as the heart of a hill-lake his tresses, Scarlet the crown of the poppies inwoven I'the thick wavy hair that crowneth his whiteness, Strong the white arms, The broad heaving breast, The tent thighs guiding The mighty stallion. Out from the gloom Of the mountain valley, Where cliffs of basalt Make noontide twilight, And where the great-bat Swingeth his heavy wings, And echo reverberates The screams of the falcons: Where nought else soundeth Save the surge or the moaning Of mountain-winds, Or the long crash and rattle Of falling stones Spurned by the hill fox Seeking his hollow lair: Out from the gorge Into the sunlight, To the glowing world, To the flowers and the birds And the west wind laden With the breaths of rosemary, basil, and thyme— Comes the white rider, The naked youth Glowing like ivory In the yellow sunshine. Beautiful, beautiful, this youth of the mountain, Laughing low as he rideth Forth to the sunlight, The scarlet poppies agleam in his tresses Dark as the thick-cluster'd grapes of the ivy; While over the foam Of the sea of narcissi, And high through the surf Of the asphodels, Trampleth, and snorteth From his bloodred nostrils, The cream-white stallion. THE FALLEN GODDESS (On a Statue of Venus, found near Anzio (Antium) on the Latin Coast, and now in a Church as the Madonna of the Seven Sorrows). Not here, O Goddess, In these chill glooms With silence about thee— Save when at matins or dusk o'the evensong The priests mutter Or chant the Mass, And the few tired peasants Pray with bent heads, Lost in the stillness, Lost in the gloom— Not here, O Goddess, Thy resting-place, Who, ages ago, When the world was young, Stood where the myrtles and roses were blooming, Stood where the dayshine was rising and flooding Up from the purple-blue flower of the ocean, Flooding and rising till all of the inland Glowed in the splendour, and valley and mountain Laughed with the joy of the world's young laughter. Ah, when about thee, The roses were twined, When thy feet were covered With roses and lilies, And when, before thee, Fresh pluckt by thy fountain, Lay sweet-smelling violets— Ah, when beside thee The lovers prayed, He wan as ivory Found where the sources Of Nilus wander In swart Ethiopia, She as the nenuphar Waked by the moonlight Flooding the river, as Duskily moving In coils gigantic It flows through the desert, Where the Sphinx broodeth And where, at dawn, The voice of Memnon Solemnly calls— Ah, when beside thee, The lovers prayed, And thy heart was stirred With the wind of their love, With passion and longing And sweet desire— Ah, in that moment, Did some dark shadow From Time unborn Dusk thy glad vision? Didst thou, upon them, Kneeling before thee, Frown, and heed not The prayer they made: In thy heart the ache And a deathless sorrow That made their passion A bitter folly? What unto thee, then, O Venus, Goddess, The roses and lilies Entwined about thee, The fragrant violets Freshly gathered With the spray o'thy fountain Dew-sprent o'er them: What then to thee Thy myrtle-grove, Thy doves and sparrows Fluttering about thee, Fluttering, flying Through the azure air— What, O Goddess, Thy worshippers pale, He with the passion Aflame in his eyes, She with the longing Astir in her bosom, Whose two white flowers Are pressed against thee Where the violets cover And cloud thy feet? Foresawest thou ever, At morn or dusk, With lovers praying And garlanding thee With the flowers thou lovest, Or when in the silent Depths o' the night Thy vigils knew not A stir, a whisper, But all was darkness And brooding peace, Foresawest thou ever Thy doom to be? The veils of darkness That yet would cover The earth thou lovest, The passing of all The joyous gods, And slowly, slowly Across the world The chilling shadow Fall of the Cross? Ah, better that after Thy doom had fallen And thenceforth lovers Sought thee no more, And only the wild doves Hovered about thee, Only the sparrows Out of the wildwood Fluttered about thine uncrown'd forehead, Only the wild-rose clambered around thee, Only the hyacinths out of the woodland Stole through the grasses And decked thee and girt thee— Better that after The fierce barbarians Thrust thee prostrate With laughter and mocking, And left thee, there, In the Groves of Venus, A thing dishonoured, A Fallen Goddess,— Better that then The weeds had gathered And swift o'ergrown thee, And leaves of autumn, And dust o' the wind, And earth and mosses, Had swallowed thee up, Had hidden thee ever, There in thy sorrow, There in thy dream, With none to know of thee, None to mourn, Save only the wild-dove brooding alone, Only the song-birds lost in the thicket, Only the hyacinths, lilies, and roses, Only the grasses that wave round thy fountain, Only the violets, purple, sweet-smelling, Deep in the heart of them, lost in their twilight. Harsh fate for thee, Goddess, not thus to have lain In the mould and the darkness Till at last, in the far-off, The slow revolution Of ages or aeons Should bring thee, awaking, The sound of rejoicing, And all thy white kindred Should gather about thee, With songs and laughter, And greet thee, and bless thee, And woo thee with longing and rapture and kisses, While joyous behind them, From mountain and valley And up from the shores of The vast flower of Ocean, White-robed lovers should hasten and follow, Hands claspt in hands, With baskets of roses And lilies for thee, And doves soft and snowwhite As these, thy white breasts, And prayers, and incense Of violets fragrant, Fresh-gathered violets smelling of thee: Then, then, would'st thou stir In the dark mould about thee, And sweet in the woodland The wild-doves would murmur, And swift in the thicket the song-birds would gather, And all from about thee the darkness would lessen. Up through the grasses, and where the wild hyacinths Cluster enmassed in a hollow of blueness, And where the wild-roses are raining their petals Down through the fragrant green boughs of their tangle, Up through the midst of them, white as a seabird Rising from out of the joy of the billows, Swift would arise, like a flower too, thine arm: Then from the tangle of roses and grasses— O but the joy of it! white gleaming shoulders, Head with the halo of empire about it, Eyes deep with the dream of the secrets of life, And breasts soft and white as the milk held within them— O body of beauty, O Venus, O Goddess Thus, thus would thy birth be, thy glad resurrection! Ah better that after Thy doom had fallen Thou had'st not waken'd, O Goddess, more! Better that never The Roman warriors Staring upon thee Beheld thy beauty And laughed to see it, And took thee and haled thee Far from thy grove, And girt thee with rushes and flags from the sea-shore, And laid thee a captive deep down in a war-boat, And heedless of wrath or of vengeance from heaven Carried thee far through the waters Ionian, Up through the wide lonely waste of the Tyrrhene, Till dim through the haze, like a cloud at the dawning, The low shores of Latium Blue rose before thee. Was it for this, O Venus, Goddess, That thou hast passioned? O bitter lust Of a joyless faith, That mocketh beauty And laudeth the grave: What thing is this, What bitter mocking, That thou hast taken The sacred Goddess And raised her darkling Here in thy temple, Midst tawdry idols And childish things— Hast placed upon her Immaculate brows This tinsel crown; And hung about her These pitiful robes That a slave would have scorned In the olden days When men loved beauty For beauty's sake: Hast decked her bosom (O Heart of Love!) With a thing shaped heart-wise And seven times pierced With brazen arrows: Hast stolen thy name, even, Goddess, Venus, And called thee Mother Of a God thou know'st not, Called thee Madonna, the Mother of Sorrows, Called thee the Virgin of Sorrows Seven— Was it for this— Ah, better a thousand times They had wrought thy havoc, There, in the heart of Thy sacred grove: Better—O bitterness Of things that are, Goddess, and Queen! DE PROFUNDIS. Whence hast thou gone, O vision belovëd? There is silence now In thy groves, and never A voice proclaimeth Thy glory come, Thy joy rearisen! O passion of beauty, Forsake not thus Those who have worshipped thee, Body and soul! Come to us, come to us, Inviolate, Beautiful, Thou whose breath Is as Spring o'er the world, Whose smile is the flowering Of the wide green Earth! Deep in the heart of thee, Like a moonbeam moving Through the heart of a hill-lake, Moveth Compassion: O Belovëd, Be with us ever, Thou, the Beautiful, Passion of Beauty, Alma Victrix! ULTIMO SOSPIRO. O dolce primavera pien' di olezzo e amor! Che fai tu..... che fai fra tanti fior? Colgo le rose amabili dei più soavi odori; Colgo le rose affabili e i lunghi gelsomini, Nei olenti miei giardini io vi tengo al cor. Roman Folksong. Joy of the world, O flower-crown'd Spring, With thine odorous breath and thy heart of love, Breathe through this verse thy sweet message of longing. Lo, in the gardens of Alma, whose lovers Die gladly in worship, but fail not ever, Oft have I strayed, Oft have I lingered When high through the noon the lost lark has been singing, Or when in the moonlight Soft through the silence has whispered the ocean, Or when, in the dark Of the ilex-woods, Where the fireflies wavered Frail wandering stars, Not a sound has been heard But Scirocco rustling The midmost leaves Of the trees where he sleepeth. Roses of love, White lilies of dream, Frail blooms that have blossom'd Into life with thy breathing: Blow them, O wind, West wind of the Spring, Lift them and take them where gardens await them, Lift them and take them to those who hearken, Facing the dawn, for the sounds of the morning, With wide eyes glad with the beautiful vision, O whispers of joy, O breaths of passion, O sighs of longing.</field>
