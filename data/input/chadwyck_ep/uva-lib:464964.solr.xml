      <field name="fulltext">THE SPLEEN. This motly piece to you I send, Who always were a faithful friend, Who, if disputes should happen hence, Can best explain the author's sense, And, anxious for the publick weal, Do, what I sing, so often feel. The want of method pray excuse, Allowing for a vapour'd Muse; Nor, to a narrow path confin'd, Hedge in by rules a roving mind. The child is genuine; you can trace, Throughout, the sire's transmitted face. Nothing is stol'n: my Muse, tho' mean, Draws from the spring, she finds within; Nor vainly buys, what Gildon sells, Poetic buckets for dry wells. School-helps I want to climb on high, Where all the ancient treasures lie, And there unseen commit a theft On wealth in Greek exchequers left. Then where? from whom? what can I steal? Who only with the moderns deal: This were attempting to put on Rayment from naked bodies won: They safely sing before a thief, They cannot give, who want relief; Some few excepted, names well known, And justly laurel'd with renown, Whose stamp of genius marks their ware, And theft detects: of theft beware; From Moore so lasht, example fit, Shun petty larceny in wit. First know, my friend, I do not mean To write a treatise on the spleen; Nor to prescribe, when nerves convulse, Nor mend th'alarum watch, your pulse: If I am right, your question lay, What course I take to drive away The day-mare spleen, by whose false pleas Men prove mere suicides in ease; And how I do myself demean In stormy world to live serene. When by its magick lanthorn spleen With frightful figures spread life's scene, And threatning prospects urg'd my fears, A stranger to the luck of heirs; Reason, some quiet to restore, Shew'd part was substance, shadow more; With spleen's dead weight tho' heavy grown, In life's rough tide I sunk not down, But swam, till fortune threw a rope Buoyant on bladders fill'd with hope. I always choose the plainest food To mend viscidity of blood. Hail! water-gruel, healing power, Of easy access to the poor; Thy help love's confessors implore, And doctors secretly adore: To thee I fly, by thee dilute, Thro' veins my blood doth quicker shoot; And by swift current throws off clean Prolific particles of spleen. I never sick by drinking grow, Nor keep myself a cup too low: And seldom Cloe's lodgings haunt, Thrifty of spirits, which I want. Hunting I reckon very good To brace the nerves, and stir the blood; But after no field-honours itch, Atchiev'd by leaping hedge and ditch. While spleen lies soft relax'd in bed, Or o'er coal-fires inclines the head, Hygea's sons with hound and horn, And jovial cry awake the morn: These see her from her dusky plight, Smear'd by th'embraces of the night, With roral wash redeem her face, And prove herself of Titan's race, And mounting in loose robes the skies, Shed light and fragrance, as she flies. Then horse and hound fierce joy display, Exulting at the Hark-away, And in pursuit o'er tainted ground From lungs robust field-notes resound. Then, as St. George the dragon slew, Spleen pierc'd, trod down, and dying view, While all the spirits are on wing, And woods, and hills, and valleys ring. To cure the mind's wrong bias, spleen, Some recommend the bowling-green; Some, hilly walks; all, exercise; Fling but a stone, the giant dies; Laugh and be well; monkeys have been Extreme good doctors for the spleen; And kitten, if the humour hit, Has harlequin'd away the fit. Since mirth is good on this behalf, At some partic'lars let us laugh. Witlings, brisk fools curst with half sense, That stimulates their impotence, Who buzz in rhyme, and, like blind flies, Err with their wings for want of eyes; Poor authors worshipping a calf; Deep tragedies that make us laugh; A strict dissenter saying grace; A lect'rer preaching for a place; Folks, things prophetic to dispense, Making the past the future tense; The popish dubbing of a priest; Fine epitaphs on knaves deceas'd; Green-apron'd Pythonissa's rage; Great Æsculapius on his stage; A miser starving to be rich; The prior of Newgate's dying speech; A jointur'd widow's ritual state; Two Jews disputing tête à tête; New almanacks compos'd by seers; Experiments on felons ears; Disdainful prudes, who ceaseless ply The superb muscle of the eye; A coquet's April-weather face; A Queenb'rough mayor behind his mace; And fops in military shew, Are sovereign for the case in view. If spleen-fogs rise at close of day, I clear my ev'ning with a play, Or to some concert take my way. The company, the shine of lights, The scenes of humour, musick's flights Adjust, and set the soul to rights. Life's moving pictures, well-wrought plays, To other's griefs attention raise: Here, while the tragick fictions glow, We borrow joy by pitying woe; There, gaily comick scenes delight, And hold true mirrours to our sight. Virtue, in charming dress array'd, Calling the passions to her aid, When moral scenes just action join, Takes shape, and shews her face divine. Musick has charms, we all may find, Ingratiate deeply with the mind. When art does sound's high power advance, To musick's pipe the passions dance; Motions unwill'd its power have shewn, Tarantulated by a tune. Many have held the soul to be Nearly allied to harmony. Her have I known indulging grief, And shunning company's relief, Unveil her face, and, looking round, Own by neglecting sorrow's wound The consanguinity of sound. In rainy days keep double guard, Or spleen will surely be too hard, Which, like those fish by sailors met, Flies highest, while its wings are wet. In such dull weather, so unfit To enterprize a work of wit, When clouds one yard of azure sky, That's fit for simile, deny; I dress my face with studious looks, And shorten tedious hours with books. But, if dull fogs invade the head, That mem'ry minds not what is read, I sit in window dry as ark, And on the drowning world remark: Or to some coffee-house I stray For news, the manna of a day, And from the hipp'd discourses gather, That politicks go by the weather: Then seek good-humour'd tavern chums, And play at cards, but for small sums; Or with the merry fellows quaff, And laugh aloud with them that laugh; Or drink a joco-serious cup With souls, who've took their freedom up, And let my mind, beguil'd by talk, In Epicurus' garden walk, Who thought it heav'n to be serene, Pain, hell, and purgatory, spleen. Sometimes I dress, with women sit, And chat away the gloomy fit, Quit the stiff garb of serious sense, And wear a gay impertinence; Nor think, nor speak with any pains, But lay on fancy's neck the reins. Talk of unusual swell of waist In maid of honour loosely lac'd; And beauty borrowing Spanish red; And loving pair with sep'rate bed; And jewels pawn'd for loss of game, And then redeem'd by loss of fame; Of Kitty (aunt left in the lurch By grave pretence to go to church) Perceiv'd in hack with lover fine, Like Will and Mary on the coin. And thus in modish manner we In aid of sugar sweeten tea. Permit, ye fair, your idol form, Which e'en the coldest heart can warm, May with its beauties grace my line, While I bow down before it's shrine, And your throng'd altars with my lays Perfume, and get by giving praise. With speech so sweet, so sweet a mien, You excommunicate the spleen, Which fiend-like flies the magick ring, You form with sound, when pleas'd to sing. Whate'er you say, howe'er you move, We look, we listen, and approve. Your touch, which gives to feeling bliss, Our nerves officious throng to kiss; By Celia's pat on their report The grave-air'd soul, inclin'd to sport, Renounces wisdom's sullen pomp, And loves the floral game to romp. But who can view the pointed rays, That from black eyes scintillant blaze? Love on his throne of glory seems Encompast with Satellite beams. But when blue eyes more softly bright Diffuse benignly humid light, We gaze, and see the smiling loves, And Cytherea's gentle doves, And raptur'd fix in such a face, Love's mercy-seat, and throne of grace. Shine but on age, you melt its snow, Again fires long-extinguish'd glow, And, charm'd by witchery of eyes, Blood long congealed liquifies, True miracle, and fairly done By heads, which are ador'd while on. But oh! what pity 'tis to find Such beauties both of form and mind, By modern breeding much debas'd In half the female world at least! Hence I with care such lotteries shun, Where, a prize mist, I'm quite undone, And ha'n't by venturing on a wife Yet run the greatest risk in life. Mothers, and guardian aunts, forbear Your impious pains to form the fair, Nor lay out so much cost and art, But to deflower the virgin heart, Of ev'ry folly fostering bed By quick'ning heat of custom bred. Rather, than by your culture spoil'd, Desist, and give us nature wild, Delighted with a hoyden soul, Which truth and innocence controul. Coquets leave off affected arts, Gay fowlers at a flock of hearts, Woodcocks to shun your snares have skill, You shew so plain you strive to kill. In love the artless catch the game, And they scarce miss, who never aim. The world's great author did create The sex to fit the nuptial state, And meant a blessing in a wife To solace the fatigues of life; And old inspired times display, How wives could love, and yet obey. Then truth, and patience of controul, And houswife arts adorn'd the soul; And charms, the gift of nature, shone; And jealousy, a thing unknown; Veils were the only masks they wore, Novels (receipts to make a whore) Nor ombre, nor quadrille they knew, Nor Pam's puissance felt at Lu. Wise men did not, to be thought gay, Then compliment their power away: But lest, by frail desires misled, The girls forbidden paths should tread, Of ignorance rais'd the safe high wall, But we haw-haws, that shew them all; Thus we at once solicit sense, And charge them not to break the fence. Now, if untir'd, consider friend, What I avoid to gain my end. I never am at meeting seen, Meeting, that region of the spleen; The broken heart, the busy fiend, The inward call on spleen depend. Law, licens'd breaking of the peace, To which vacation is disease, A gipsey diction scarce known well By th'Magi, who law-fortunes tell, I shun, nor let it breed within Anxiety, and that the spleen: Law grown a forest, where perplex The mazes, and the brambles vex, Where its twelve verd'rers ev'ry day Are changing still the publick way; Yet, if we miss our path and err, We grievous penalties incur, And wand'rers tire, and tear their skin, And then get out, where they went in. I never game, and rarely bet, Am loth to lend, or run in debt. No compter-writs me agitate, Who moralizing pass the gate, And there mine eyes on spendthrifts turn, Who vainly o'er their bondage mourn. Wisdom, before beneath their care, Pays her upbraiding visits there, And forces folly thro' the grate Her panegyric to repeat. This view, profusely when inclin'd, Enters a caveat in the mind. Experience join'd with common sense To mortals is a providence. Passion, as frequently is seen, Subsiding settles into spleen; Hence, as the plague of happy life, I run away from party-strife. A prince's cause, a church's claim, I've known to raise a mighty flame, And priest, as stoker, very free To throw in peace and charity. That tribe, whose practicals decree Small-beer the deadliest heresy; Who, fond of pedigree, derive From the most noted whore alive; Who own wine's old prophetick aid, And love the mitre, Bacchus made, Forbid the faithful to depend On half-pint drinkers for a friend; And in whose gay red-letter'd face We read good-living more than grace: Nor they so pure, and so precise, Immac'late as their white of eyes; Who for the Spirit hug the Spleen, Phylacter'd throughout all their mien; Who their ill-tasted home-brew'd prayer To the state's mellow forms prefer; Who doctrines, as infectious, fear, Which are not steep'd in vinegar; And samples of heart-chested grace Expose in shew-glass of the face; Did never me as yet provoke, Either to honour band and cloak, Or deck my hat with leaves of oak. I rail not with mock-patriot grace At folks, because they are in place; Nor, hir'd to praise with stallion pen, Serve the ear-lechery of men; And, to avoid religious jarrs, The laws are my expositors, Which in my doubting mind create Conformity to Church and state. I go, pursuant to my plan, To Mecca with the caravan, And think it right in common sense Both for diversion and defence. Reforming schemes are none of mine: To mend the world's a vast design, Like theirs, who tug in little boat To pull to them the ship afloat, While, to defeat their labour'd end, At once both wind and stream contend: Success herein is seldom seen, And zeal, when baffled, turns to spleen. Happy the man, who innocent Grieves not at ills, he can't prevent! His skiff does with the current glide, Not puffing pull'd against the tide; He, paddling by the scuffling crowd, Sees unconcern'd life's wager row'd, And, when he can't prevent foul-play, Enjoys the folly of the fray. By these reflections I repeal Each hasty promise made in zeal. When g?l-p?s say, We're bound our great light to display, And Indian darkness drive away; Yet none but drunken watchmen send, And scoundrel link-boys for that end; When they cry up this holy war, Which ev'ry christian should be for, Yet such as owe the law their ears We find employ'd as engineers: This view my forward zeal so shocks, In vain they hold the money-box; At such a conduct, which intends By vitious means such virtuous ends, I laugh off spleen, and keep my pence From spoiling Indian innocence. Yet philosophic love of ease I suffer not to prove disease; But rise up in the virtuous cause Of a free press, and equal laws. The press restrain'd! nefandous thought! In vain our sires have nobly fought. While free from force the press remains, Virtue and freedom chear our plains, And learning largesses bestows, And keeps uncensur'd open house; We to the nation's public mart Our works of wit, and schemes of art, And philosophic goods, this way, Like water-carriage cheap convey. This tree, which knowledge so affords, Inquisitors with flaming swords From lay-approach with zeal defend, Lest their own paradise should end. The press from her fecundous womb Brought forth the arts of Greece and Rome; Her offspring, skill'd in logick war, Truth's banner wav'd in open air; The monster Superstition fled, And hid in shades its Gorgon head; And lawless power the long-kept field, By reason quell'd, was forc'd to yield. This nurse of arts, and freedom's fence To chain, is treason against sense: And, Liberty, thy thousand tongues None silence, who design no wrongs; For those, that use the gag's restraint, First rob, before they stop complaint. Since disappointment galls within, And subjugates the soul to spleen; Most schemes as money-snares I hate, And bite not at projector's bait. Sufficient wrecks appear each day, And yet fresh fools are cast away. E're well the bubbled can turn round, Their painted vessel runs a-ground; Or in deep seas it oversets By a fierce hurricane of debts; Or helm-directors in one trip, Freight first embezzled, sink the ship. Such was of late a corporation, The brazen serpent of the nation, Which, when hard accidents distress'd, The poor must look at to be blest, And thence expect with paper seal'd By fraud and us'ry to be heal'd. I in no soul-consumption wait Whole years at levees of the great, And hungry hopes regale the while On the spare diet of a smile. There you may see the idol stand With mirrour in his wanton hand; Above, below, now here, now there, He throws about the sunny glare; Crowds pant, and press to seize the prize, The gay delusion of their eyes. When fancy tries her limning skill To draw and colour at her will, And raise and round the figures well, And shew her talent to excel, I guard my heart, lest it should woo Unreal beauties, fancy drew, And disappointed feel despair At loss of things, that never were. When I lean politicians mark Grazing on æther in the park, Who e'er on wing with open throats Fly at debates, expresses, votes, Just in the manner swallows use, Catching their airy food of news, Whose latrant stomachs oft molest The deep-laid plans, their dreams suggest; Or see some poet pensive sit, Fondly mistaking spleen for wit, Who, tho' short-winded, still will aim To sound the epic trump of fame, Who still on Phœbus' smiles will doat, Nor learn conviction from his coat; I bless my stars, I never knew Whimseys, which close pursu'd undo, And have from old experience been Both parent, and the child of spleen. These subjects of Apollo's state, (Who from false fire derive their fate, With airy purchases undone Of lands, which none lend money on,) Born dull, had follow'd thriving ways, Nor lost one hour to gather bays. Their fancies first delirious grew, And scenes ideal took for true. Fine to the sight Parnassus lies, And with false prospects cheats their eyes; The fabled goods, the poets sing, A season of perpetual spring, Brooks, flow'ry fields, and groves of trees Affording sweets, and similes, Gay dreams inspir'd in myrtle bow'rs, And wreaths of undecaying flow'rs, Apollo's harp with airs divine, The sacred musick of the nine, Views of the temple rais'd to fame, And for a vacant nitch proud aim, Ravish their souls, and plainly shew, What fancy's sketching pow'r can do; They will attempt the mountain steep, Where on the top, like dreams in sleep, The muses revelations shew, That find men crackt, or make them so. You, friend, like me, the trade of rhyme Avoid, elab'rate waste of time, Nor are content to be undone, And pass for Phœbus' crazy son. Poems, the hop-grounds of the brain, Afford the most uncertain gain; And lott'ries never tempt the wise, With blanks so many to a prize. I only transient visits pay, Meeting the Muses in my way, Scarce known to the fastidious dames, Nor skill'd to call them by their names; Nor can their passports in these days Your profit warrant, or your praise: On poems by their dictates writ Criticks, as sworn appraisers, sit, And, mere upholst'rers, in a trice On gems and paintings set a price; These Tayl'ring artists for our lays Invent cramp'd rules, and with strait stays Striving free nature's shape to hit, Emaciate sense, before they fit. A common place, and many friends, Can serve the plagiary's ends, Whose easy vamping talent lies, First wit to pilfer, then disguise. Thus some devoid of art and skill To search the mine on Pindus' hill, Proud to aspire and workmen grow, By genius doom'd to stay below, As their own digging, shew the town Wit's treasure brought by others down. Some wanting, if they find a mine, An artist's judgment to refine, On fame precipitately fixt, The ore with baser metals mixt Melt down, impatient of delay, And call the vicious mass a play. All these engage to serve their ends A band select of trusty friends, Who, lesson'd right, extol the thing, As Psaphon taught his birds to sing. Then to the ladies they submit, Returning officers on wit; A crouded house their presence draws, And on the beaux imposes laws; And judgment in its favour ends, When all the pannel are its friends: Their natures merciful and mild Have from mere pity sav'd the child; In bulrush ark the bantling found, Helpless, and ready to be drown'd, They have preserv'd by kind support, And brought the baby-muse to court. But there's a youth, that you can name, Who needs no leading-strings to fame, Whose quick maturity of brain The birth of Pallas may explain; Dreaming of whose depending fate, I heard Melpomene debate, This, this is he, that, 'twas foretold, Should emulate our Greeks of old, Inspir'd by me with sacred art, He sings, and rules the varied heart: If Jove's dread anger he rehearse, We hear the thunder in his verse; If he describe love turn'd to rage, The furies riot on his page; If he fair liberty and law By ruffian power expiring draw, The keener passions then engage Aright, and sanctify their rage; If he attempt disastrous love, We hear those plaints, that wound the grove; Within the kinder passions glow, And tears distill'd from pity flow. From the bright vision I descend, And my deserted theme attend. Me never did ambition seize, Strange fever! most inflam'd by ease, The active lunacy of pride, That courts jilt fortune for a bride. This par'dise-tree, so fair and high, I view with no aspiring eye: Like aspine shake the restless leaves, And Sodom-fruit our pains deceives; Whence frequent falls give no surprize, But fits of spleen call'd growing wise. Greatness, in glitt'ring forms display'd, Affects weak eyes much us'd to shade, And by its falsly-envy'd scene Gives self-debasing fits of spleen. We should be pleas'd that things are so, Who do for nothing see the show, And, middle-siz'd, can pass between Life's hubbub safe, because unseen, And 'midst the glare of greatness trace A watry sun-shine in the face, And pleasures fled to, to redress The sad fatigue of idleness. Contentment, parent of delight, So much a stranger to our sight, Say, goddess, in what happy place Mortals behold thy blooming face; Thy gracious auspices impart, And for thy temple chuse my heart. They, whom thou deignest to inspire, Thy science learn, to bound desire; By happy alchymy of mind They turn to pleasure all they find; They both disdain in outward mien The grave and solemn garb of spleen, And meretricious arts of dress To feign a joy, and hide distress; Unmov'd when the rude tempest blows, Without an opiate they repose; And cover'd by your shield defy The whizzing shafts, that round them fly; Nor, meddling with the Gods' affairs, Concern themselves with distant cares; But place their bliss in mental rest, And feast upon the good possest. Forc'd by soft violence of pray'r, The blithsome goddess sooths my care; I feel the deity inspire, And thus she models my desire: Two hundred pounds half-yearly paid, Annuity securely made; A farm some twenty miles from town, Small, tight, salubrious, and my own; Two maids, that never saw the town; A serving-man, not quite a clown; A boy to help to tread the mow, And drive, while t'other holds the plow; A chief of temper form'd to please, Fit to converse, and keep the keys, And, better to preserve the peace, Commission'd by the name of niece; With understandings of a size To think their master very wise. May heav'n (it's all I wish for) send One genial room to treat a friend, Where decent cup-board, little plate Displays benevolence, not state. And may my humble dwelling stand Upon some chosen spot of land; A pond before full to the brim, Where cows may cool, and geese may swim; Behind a green, like velvet neat, Soft to the eye, and to the feet, Where od'rous plants in ev'ning fair Breathe all around ambrosial air, From Eurus, foe to kitchen-ground, Fenc'd by a slope with bushes crown'd, Fit dwelling for the feather'd throng, Who pay their quit-rents with a song; With op'ning view of hills and dales, Which sense and fancy too regales, Where the half-cirque, which vision bounds, Like amphitheatre surrounds; And woods impervious to the breeze, Thick phalanx of embodied trees, From hills thro' plains in dusk array Extended far repel the day. Here stillness, height, and solemn shade Invite, and contemplation aid: Here nymphs from hollow oaks relate The dark decrees and will of fate, And dreams beneath the spreading beach Inspire, and docile fancy teach; While, soft as breezy breath of wind, Impulses rustle thro' the mind: Here Dryads, scorning Phœbus' ray, While Pan melodious pipes away, In measur'd motions frisk about, 'Till old Silenus puts them out: There see the clover, pea, and bean, Vie in variety of green; Fresh pastures speckled o'er with sheep; Brown fields their fallow sabbaths keep; Plump Ceres golden tresses wear, And poppy top-knots deck her hair; And silver streams thro' meadows stray, And Naiads on the margin play; And lesser nymphs on side of hills From play-thing urns pour down the rills. Thus shelter'd free from care and strife, May I enjoy a calm thro' life; See faction, safe in low degree, As men at land see storms at sea; And laugh at miserable elves, Not kind, so much as to themselves, Curst with such souls of base alloy, As can possess, but not enjoy, Debarr'd the pleasure to impart By av'rice, sphincter of the heart, Who wealth, hard earn'd by guilty cares, Bequeath untouch'd to thankless heirs. May I, with look ungloom'd by guile, And wearing virtue's livery-smile; Prone the distressed to relieve, And little trespasses forgive; With income not in fortune's pow'r, And skill to make a busy hour; With trips to town, life to amuse, To purchase books, and hear the news, To see old friends, brush off the clown, And quicken taste at coming down; Unhurt by sickness' blasting rage, And slowly mellowing in age, When fate extends its gath'ring gripe, Fall off like fruit grown fully ripe, Quit a worn being without pain, Perhaps to blossom soon again. But now more serious let me grow, And what I think, my Memmius, know. Th' enthusiast's hopes, and raptures wild, Have never yet my reason foil'd. His springy soul dilates like air, When free from weight of ambient care; And, hush'd in meditations deep, Slides into dreams, as when asleep; Then, fond of new discov'ries grown, Proves a Columbus of her own, Disdains the narrow bounds of place, And thro' the wilds of endless space, Borne up on metaphysic wings, Chases light forms, and shadowy things; And, in the vague excursion caught, Brings home some rare exotic thought: The melancholy man such dreams As brightest evidence esteems; Fain would he see some distant scene Suggested by his restless spleen, And fancy's telescope applies With tinctur'd glass to cheat his eyes. Such thoughts, as love the gloom of night, I close examine by the light. For who, tho' brib'd by gain to lye, Dare sun-beam written truths deny, And execute plain common sense On faith's mere hearsay evidence? That superstition mayn't create, And club its ills with those of fate, I many a notion take to task, Made dreadful by its visor-mask: Thus scruple, spasm of the mind, Is cur'd, and certainty I find; Since optic reason shews me plain, I dreaded spectres of the brain; And legendary fears are gone, Tho' in tenacious childhood sown. Thus in opinions I commence Freeholder in the proper sense, And neither suit nor service do, Nor homage to pretenders shew, Who boast themselves by spurious roll Lords of the manor of the soul; Preferring sense, from chin that's bare, To nonsense thron'd in whisker'd hair. To thee, Creator uncreate! O Entium Ens divinely great!— Hold, Muse, nor melting pinions try; Nor near the blazing glory fly; Nor straining break thy feeble bow, Unfeather'd arrows far to throw; Thro' fields unknown nor madly stray, Where no ideas mark the way; With tender eyes, and colours faint, And trembling hands forbear to paint. Who features veil'd by light can hit? Where can, what has no outline, sit? My soul, the vain attempt forego; Thyself, the fitter subject, know. He wisely shuns the bold extreme, Who soon lays by th'unequal theme, Nor runs, with wisdom's Sirens caught, On quick-sands swallowing shipwreckt thought; But, conscious of his distance, gives Mute praise, and humble negatives. In one, no object of our sight, Immutable and infinite, Who can't be cruel or unjust, Calm and resign'd, I fix my trust; To him my past and present state I owe, and must my future fate. A stranger into life I'm come, Dying may be our going home, Transported here by angry fate, The convicts of a prior state: Hence I no anxious thoughts bestow On matters, I can never know. Thro' life's foul ways, like vagrant, pass'd, He'll grant a settlement at last; And with sweet ease the wearied crown, By leave to lay his being down. If doom'd to dance th'eternal round Of life, no sooner lost than found; And dissolution soon to come, Like spunge, wipes out life's present sum, But can't our state of pow'r bereave An endless series to receive: Then, if hard dealt with here by fate, We ballance in another state, And consciousness must go along, And sign th'acquittance for the wrong. He for his creatures must decree More happiness than misery, Or be supposed to create, Curious to try, what 'tis to hate, And do an act, which rage infers, 'Cause lameness halts, or blindness errs. Thus, thus I steer my bark, and sail On even keel with gentle gale. At helm I make my reason sit, My crew of passions all submit. If dark and blustring prove some nights, Philosophy puts forth her lights; Experience holds the cautious glass, To shun the breakers, as I pass; And frequent throws the wary lead, To see what dangers may be hid. And once in seven years I'm seen At Bath, or Tunbridge, to careen. Tho' pleas'd to see the dolphins play, I mind my compass and my way; With store sufficient for relief, And wisely still prepar'd to reef; Nor wanting the dispersive bowl Of cloudy weather in the soul, I make (may heav'n propitious send Such wind and weather to the end) Neither becalm'd, nor over-blown, Life's voyage to the world unknown.
