      <field name="fulltext">ORIGINAL POEMSSquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Poems of Undoubted Authorship WRITTEN WITH A DIAMOND ON HER WINDOW AT WOODSTOCK Much suspected by me, Nothing proved can be, Quoth Elizabeth prisoner. WRITTEN ON A WALL AT WOODSTOCK Oh fortune, thy wresting wavering state Hath fraught with cares my troubled wit, Whose witness this present prison late Could bear, where once was joy's loan quit. Thou causedst the guilty to be loosed From bands where innocents were inclosed, And caused the guiltless to be reserved, And freed those that death had well deserved. But all herein can be nothing wrought, So God send to my foes all they have thought. WRITTEN IN HER FRENCH PSALTER No crooked leg, no bleared eye, No part deformed out of kind, Nor yet so ugly half can be As is the inward suspicious mind. THE DOUBT OF FUTURE FOES The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy, And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy; For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects' faith doth ebb, Which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web. But clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds, Which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds. The top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be, And fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see. The dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds, Shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds. The daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow Shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know. No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port; Our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort. My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ To poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy. ON FORTUNE Never think you fortune can bear the sway Where virtue's force can cause her to obey. ON MONSIEUR'S DEPARTURE I grieve and dare not show my discontent, I love and yet am forced to seem to hate, I do, yet dare not say I ever meant, I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate. I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned, Since from myself another self I turned. My care is like my shadow in the sun, Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it, Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done. His too familiar care doth make me rue it. No means I find to rid him from my breast, Till by the end of things it be supprest. Some gentler passion slide into my mind, For I am soft and made of melting snow; Or be more cruel, love, and so be kind. Let me or float or sink, be high or low. Or let me live with some more sweet content, Or die and so forget what love ere meant. Poems of Doubtful Authorship CHRIST WAS THE WORDThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Christ was the Word that spake it; He took the bread and brake it, And what the Word did make it, That I believe and take it. FOUR KNIGHTS OF NOTTINGHAMSHIREThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Gervase the gentle, Stanhope the stout, Markham the lion, and Sutton the lout. REBUS ON NOEL'S NAMEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. The word of denial and the letter of fifty Makes the gentleman's name that will never be thrifty. Noel's reply: The foe to the stomach and the word of disgrace Shows the gentleman's name with the bold face. REPLY TO RALEIGHThe attribution of this poem is questionable. [Fain would I climb yet fear I to fall.] If thy heart fail thee, climb not at all. AN ENGLISH HEXAMETERThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Persius a crab-staff, bawdy Martial, Ovid a fine wag. WHEN I WAS FAIR AND YOUNGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. When I was fair and young, then favor graced me. Of many was I sought their mistress for to be, But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore: Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe, How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show, But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore: Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. Then spake fair Venus' son, that brave victorious boy, Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy, I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more: Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast That neither night nor day I could take any rest. Wherefore I did repent that I had said before: Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more. EPITAPH MADE BY THE QUEEN'S MAJESTY AT THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS OF ESPINOYEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. When the warrior Phoebus goeth to make his round With a painful course to t'other hemisphere, A dark shadow, a great horror and a fear In I know not what clouds environ the ground. And even so for Pinoy, that fair virtuous lady (Although Jupiter have in this horizon Made a star of her by the Ariadnian crown), Mourns, dolor and grief accompany our body. O Atropos, thou hast done a work perverst, And as a bird that hath lost both young and nest About the place where it was makes many a turn, Even so doth Cupid, that infant god of amor, Fly about the tomb where she lies all in dolor, Weeping for her eyes wherein he made sojourn. NOW LEAVE AND LET ME RESTThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Now leave and let me rest, Dame Pleasure be content; Go choose among the best, My doting days be spent. By sundry signs I see Thy proffers are but vain, And wisdom warneth me That pleasure asketh pain. And Nature that doth know How time her steps doth try Gives place to painful woe And bids me learn to die. Since all fair earthly things Soon ripe will soon be rot, And all that pleasant springs Soon withered, soon forgot. And youth that yields new joys That wanton lust desires In age repents the toys That reckless youth requires. All which delights I leave To such as folly trains By pleasure to deceive Till they do feel the pains. And from vain pleasures past I fly and fain would know The happy life at last Whereto I hope to go, For words or wise reports Or yet examples gone Can bridle youthful sports Till age comes stealing on. The pleasant courtly games That I delighted in, Mine elder age now shames Such follies to begin, And all the fancies strange That fond delight brought forth I do intend to change And count them nothing worth. For I by process worn Am taught to know the skill What might have been forborne In my young reckless will. By which good proof I fleet. From will to wit again In hope to set my feet In surety to remain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERSE TRANSLATIONS THE THIRTEENTH PSALM OF DAVID Fools that true faith yet never had Saith in their hearts, there is no God. Filthy they are in their practice, Of them not one is godly wise. From heaven the Lord on man did look To know what ways he undertook. All they were vain and went astray, Not one he found in the right way. In heart and tongue have they deceit, Their lips throw forth a poisoned bait. Their minds are mad, their mouths are wode, And swift they be in shedding blood. So blind they are, no truth they know, No fear of God in them will grow. How can that cruel sort be good, Of God's dear flock which suck the blood? On him rightly shall they not call, Despair will so their hearts appall. At all times God is with the just, Because they put in him their trust. Who shall therefore from Sion give That health which hangeth in our belief? When God shall take from his the smart, Then will Jacob rejoice in heart. Praise to God PETRARCH'S TRIUMPH OF ETERNITY (LINES 1–90) Amazed to see nought under heaven's cope Steady and fast, thus to myself I spake: Advise thee well-on whom doth hang thy hope? On God, said I, that promise never brake With those that trust in him. But now I know How erst the fickle world abused me, Eke what I am and was. And now to go Or rather fly the nimble time I see, Blame would I, wist I whom; for all the crime Is mine that should (not slacking till the last) Have erst unclosed mine eyes before this time. For truth to say, old wax I all too fast, But over late God's grace came never yet. In me also I trust there shall be wrought Works wonderful and strange by means of it. These said and answer made, thus more I thought: If none of all these things do stand in stay That heaven turns and guides, what end at last Shall follow of their ever turning sway? While deeper yet my searching mind I cast, A world all new even then it seemed me In never changing and ever living age, The sun, the sky with all her stars to see Dissolved quite with earth and seas that rage, One made more fair and pleasant in his place. When him that never stayed but erst to change Each thing was wont wandering in divers race Stand on one foot I saw; how seemed it strange All his three parts brought into only one, And that one fast, so that as wont it was No more so swift it hasted to be gone But had one show as earth despoiled of grass. There were not shall be, hath been, after erst To irksome, weak and divers state that brought Our life. As sun doth pierce the glass, so pierced My thought, yea more, for nothing stoppeth thought. What grace find I to see if I attain Even face to face the greatest good of all (No ill which only time gives and again As first it came with time eke part it shall). The Bull or Fish lodge shall no more the sun, Whose change doth make a toil now die, now spring, Now waste, now grow. Oh happy sprights that won Or shall hereafter stand in the chief ring, Whose names aye memory writes in her book! On happy he to find, whose hap shall be, The deep channel of this swift running brook, Whose name is life, that many wish to see. Wretched and blind the common sort that stay Their hope on things which time reaves in a trice, All deaf, naked and subject to decay, Quite void of reason and of good advice And wretched mortal men throughout diseased. Whose beck doth guide the world, by whom at jar Are set the elements and eke appeased, Whose skill doth stretch beyond my reach so far That even the angels are content and joy Of thousand parts but one to see, and bend Their wits to this, and this wish to enjoy. On happy wandering mind, aye hungering to the end, What mean so many thoughts? One hour doth reave That many years gathered with much ado. Tomorrow, yesterday, morning and eve, That press our soul and it encumber so, Before him pass shade-like at once away, For was or shall be no place shall be found But for the time of is, now and today, Only eternity knit fast and sound. Huge hills shall be made plain that stopped clean Our sight, nor shall there anything remain Whereon may hope or our remembrance lean, Whose change make other do that is but vain, And life to seem a sport. Even with this thought, What shall I be, what was I heretofore, All shall be one nor piece-meal parted ought. Summer shall be nor winter any more, But time shall die, and place be changed withal, And years shall bear no rule on mortal fame, But his renown forever flourish shall That once achieved to be of flowering name. Oh happy souls that now the path doth tread Or henceforth shall, when so it haps to be, Which to the end whereof I speak doth lead. Of fair and wandering sprights yet happiest she Whom death hath slain far short of nature's bound. The heavenly talk, good words and thoughts so chaste Open shall lie unfolded in that stound, Which kind within a youthful heart hath placed. THE SECOND CHORUS FROM SENECA'S HERCULES OETAEUS What harming hurl of fortune's arm thou dreadest, Let fraught of faith the burden of care relieve, And take thou such, to fear approved by proof, The unpicked locks of certain trust to hold; For geason is the faith, and rarely kept is trust, Where puffed sails from best forewinds be fallen. The weight of scepter's sway if choice must bear, Albeit the vulgar crew fill full thy gates, And hundred thresholds with their feet be smoothed: Though with thy gleaves and axes thou be armed, And root full great do glory give thy name, Amid the view of all these sundry sorts One faultless faith her room even scant may claim. The golden ledge full wrathful spites besets, And where the gates their posts draw forth by breadth More easy way to guiles and passed safe. Heed then the clocks of warned harms with good, And let the hidden blade not wrong thee work, For when most show by gazers' eyes is spied, And presence great thy honor most advance, This gift retain as fellow to thy room: Disdain may frown, but envy thrust thee through. No ofter doth the east the night's care release And makes the shady dark with light abash Than kings be made in an instant short, and marred; So icy is their joy and hopeless woe. The love of kingdom's rule observed with care, But for himself a king but few regard. The court's luster a stale guest made for me, Delighted with the shine no woe forthought. And this man seeks the nearest room to prince, To glittering view amid the streets he comes; While broiled is with cark the miser's breast In search of gainful grasp his name to spread. In compass of the hoarded heaps to find One bit to slake desire's wave he seeks. Not all the coast where Istrus' trade doth haunt, With gems bedecked through hue of diverse kind, Nor Lydia fair with sweetest streams suffice To quench nor answer all such thirst by half; Nor yet the soil that bides Zephirus' slave, Abashed at golden shining Tagus' beams, Nor Hebrus' service may content at full, Rich though Hydaspes' hedge his fields throw out, Though Ganges' course his confines all do graze With filled force to water all his lands. To greedy grating wights enough not all That nature well doth please his lack not so. This man doth homage unto kingly force, And harbor Rome adores where last he haunts, Not meaning that this plowshare should advance Like crooked hind his master's gain with clots By murdering the ground; no ease of toil Though thousand leas his husbandmen turn up. Well pleased rests his hearth with goods even such As pleasure may by gift another need. A badder sort the prince's court regard With foiled foot that stumble gives at all And each to lose with no avail to one. That might may equal harm they power achieve Whose living's thread drawn out is of such length Whom hap nor takes ere nature calls away. The horned newed moon them blessed calls Whose wane them misers judges when day doth fall. A man full rarely happy is and old. More surer sleeps thee downy turfs procure: All Tyre, where purple woven is and made, Not so sound slumber doth his owner yield. The gilded roofs the quiet rest bereave, And waking nights the purple draws from ease. O that the breasts of rich men naked were, The smoothed dreads of lofty lucks that hide; The Brutian stream more milder course doth hold When eastern wind him strikes with force's stroke. In franched mind from care the silly soul possest, A pot of beechen tree full sure he keeps With steady hand that fears no snatch from hold. No sudden fright affrays, no thief he dreads; With ease y-got and single show he feeds And recks not for the girded blades to thigh. The golden cup of bloody mixture keeps. The wife that is y-tied to man of mean estate No carking hath in order pain to set, Nor shining gift of reddy sea she wears Her ears free from the pluck of gemmy weight; No stone of Eoas' waves her cumber makes. Soft wool ingrained with Sidon's purple fair Drinks not the red for use that her befalls; No Maeon needle filleth she with skeins By parted hues that give the shade with art. The silky land that lies to sunny east Needs not the fruit from eastern tree to pluck; Every herb the colors' die may mix That distaff fills with yarn that skill not spun. She nursed not the doubts of wedlock bed; Of lewd suspect of weary works she shuns. The wrathful lamp Erinis lighteth up The feastful day adorns by pestering rout. The poor man deemeth not his happy state Till wealthy folk by fall it show. Who so, therefore, the middle way eschews The wry and crooked balk's most sure to tread. While Phaeton boy one day of father got To rule the reins and eke his wain to guide In leaving wonted walk and worned ways Which by slide, while the uncouth skies he shares Such place as heat of Phoebus' flame knew not. His ruin was the world his fellow plain. Daedalus yet more larger scope and broader took, Who never yet a sea by name did grace. Though Icarus sought the true and living birds By guile to pass and win the tryer's right, His father's feathered wings despised with scorn, To Phoebus near with swifty gait he hies, And christened by this slip the sea was sure. Evil bought the great where ill exceeds the good. Let one full happy be and highly flee. God shield that mighty me the vulgar call. The lee of shore my silly boat shall loathe, Let no full wind to depth my bark bequeath. From safest creeks doth fortune glide and shun, With search in middest sea for tallest ship And takes its dearest prey the nearer to cloud. THE METRES OF BOETHIUS' CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY I.i. Righmes that my groing studie ons perfourmed, In teares, alas, cumpeld, woful staves begin. My muses torne, behold, what write I shuld, indites, Wher tru woful uerse my face with dole bedews. Thes at lest no terror might constrain, That felowes to our mone our way they shuld refrain. The glory ons of happy griny youthe, Now, fates of grounting age, my comfort all. Vnlookt for age hied by mishaps is come, And sorow bidz his time to add withal. Vnseasond hore heares upon my hed ar powrd, And loosed skin in feable body shakes. Blessed dethe, that in switest yeres refraines, But, oft calld, comes to the woful wights. O with how defe eare she from the wretched wries, And wailing yees, cruel, to shut denies. While gileful fortune with vading goodz did shine, My life wel ny the doleful houre bereved; Whan her fals looke a cloude hath changed, My wretched life thankles abode protractz. Why me so oft, my frendz, have you happy cald? Who fauleth downe in stedy step yet never stode. I.ii. O in how hedlong depth the drowned mind is dimme! And losing light her owne, to others darkenis drawne, As oft as driuen with erthely flawes the harmful care upward grows. Wons this man fre in open fild used the skies to vew, Of rose sun the light beheld, Of frosty mone the planetz saw, And what star els runs her wonted cours. Bending by many circles this man had wone By number to knowe them all; Yea, causis eache whens roring windz the seas perturbz. Acquainted with the spirit that rolles the stedy world, And why the star that falz to the Hisperias waters From his reddy roote doth raise herself. Who that gives the springes mild houres ther temper, That with rosy floures the erthe be deckt, Who made the fertile autumne at fullist of the yere Abound with grape al solne with ripest fruits. He, wonted to serche and find sondry causes of hiden nature, Downe lies of minds light bereued, With brused neck by overheuy chaines, A bowed lowe looke by waight bearing, Driven, alas, the sely erthe behold. I.iii. Than night overblowen, the darkenis left me, And formar strengh unto my yees retornd. As whan the heavens astound with hedlong wind, And pale amidst the cloudy mistes The sun is hid, and in the heavens no stars aperes, From hy the night on erthe is spred: The same if Boreas sent from his Tracien den Doth strike and opens the hiden day, Shines out, and with his soudan light ?ebus shaken With his beams strikes al lokars on. I.iv. Who so quiet in setled life Proud fate kepes under fote And stable defending eache fortune His chire unwonne preserues, Him shal no rage nor seas threates, From depthe that hurles her fome, Nor wood Veseuus with holy pittz That burstz out his smoky fires, Nor way of flaming sul?ar, wont to strike The towers hie, can moue. Why so muche can wretched men At fiers tirants wondar, forsles, furious? Hope thou naugh ne feare, Disarme thou may the powreles ire; But who so quaking feares or wische, Not being stable, and in his strengh Down falz his shild, and changing place, Huges the chaine by wiche he is drawen. I.v. O framar of the starry circle, Who, lening to the lasting grounstone, Withe whorling blast hevens turnest And law compelst the skies to beare, Now that with ful horne, Meting all her brothers flames, The lessar stars the mone dimmes, Now darke and pale her horne, Nar to the son loseth her light. And she that at beginning of night Hesperus frosen rising makes, And Luci?ar palled by ?ebus upriseth, Againe her wonted raines exchangeth. Thou, by the cold of lefe falne shade, Straightist thy light with shortar abode, Thou, when the feruent sommar comes, Easy nights houres deuidest. Thy power tempers the changing year, That what leves Boreas blastz bereves Gentil Se?irus brings as fast: Sedes that the north star doth behold At highest blade the dok star burneth up. Naught loused from auncient law Leves the work of her owne place. Al giding with assured end, Man's works alone thou dost dispice, O gidar by right desart from mean to kipe. For why so many slipar fortune Turnes doth make? Oppressing fautles Dew paine for wicked mete, But in hy seatz the wicked factz abide, And wicked stamps on holy necks With uniust turne, And cleare uertu dimmed With thick blackenis lurketh, And iust man the wickeds crime doth beare. Fals othe in fraude doth the annoy. Who whan the can use ther forse, Whom many uulgar feare, The mightiest kings they can subdue. O now behold of wretched rathe, Thou who so ties the bondz of all; Vs men regard, of thy great worke not the vilest part, How tost we be with fortunes waues. O weldar apeace the roring floudes And with what boundz the great heauen thou gidest The stable erthe do stedy. I.vi. Whan heuy Cancer sm? By ?ebus beames inflames, Than he that lent plentyes sead To forowes that denied them, Bigiled by Ceres faithe, Let him seake the acorne tre. The decked wode seake not Whan thou violetz do gather, Whan with the northy blastz Ther roring fildz affrightz, Nor seake not thou with gredy hand The springy palmes to weld: Grapes if thou wische injoy, In autumne Bacchus rather His gifts bestowes. Times God assigneth fit For eche mans office best, Nor the tournes that he appoints Suffers to be mixte. So what so leves by rachelous way The certain rule Joyful ende shall neuer hit. I.vii. Dim cloudes, Skie close Light none Can afourd. If roling seas Boustious sowth Mixe his fome, Griny ons Like the clirristz Days the water Straight moude Sturd up al foule The sight gainsais. Running stream That poures From hiest hilz Oft is staid By slaked Stone of rock. Thou, if thou wilt In clirest light The trothe behold, By straight lin Hit in the pathe. Chase joyes, Repulse feare, Thrust out hope, Woe not retaine. Cloudy is the mind With snafle bound Wher they raigne. II.i. This whan her proud hand changeth cours And Euripus foming like is throwne, Whilom she fierce kings cruel destroies, And lowe looke of won man deceitful raiseth. She hereth not the wretche nor hedeth his teares, Willingly skornes the sighs that spitful she made. Thus playeth she, and so her strength doth trie; A wondar great to hers she shewes: If any man you view, one houre Both thrals him and Extolz. II.ii. If sandz such store by raging flawes As stured sea turnes up, Or skies bidect with mighty stars The heuens al that lights, And suche welthe bestowes, Nor plenty with fullist horne withdrawes her hand, Mankind yet ceaseth not With wailing mones bewail him. Thogh God his vowes willingly receue, The liberal dolar of golds plenty, And gridy folke with honors great indues, Naught to haue got they seame, But egar rauining, deuouring what they had, Stretcheth the chawes for more. What raignes can drawe bak Hedlong desiar to stable end, Whan thirst of getting inflames The flowing man with largist gifts? No man thinkes him riche Who quaking mones belives a beggar. II.iii. In poole whan ?ebus with reddy waine The light to spred begins, The star dimed with flames opprissing Pales her whitty lookes. Whan wood with Si?irus mildding blast Blusheth with the springing roses, And cloudy sowthe his blustering blastes, Away from stauke the beauty goes. Some time with calmy fayre the sea Void of waves doth run; Oft boistrus tempestz the north With foming seas turnes up. If rarely stedy be the worldz forme, If turnes so many hit makes, Belive slippar mens luckes, Trust that sliding be ther goods. Certain, and in eternal law is writ, Sure standeth naugh is made. II.iv. Who lasting wyl Wary settel seat, And stable not of roring Eurus blastz ben won, And careth skorne The waves of thretning sea, Shuns soking sandes, And top of hiest mount. One the froward southe With all his affrights, The other loused refuse A hanging waight to beare. Fleing perillous lot Of pleasantz seat, On lowe stone remember Thy house sure to place. Thogh wynd blowe, Myxing waters to botom, Thou, happy plast in strengh Of quietz rampar, Happy shalt live And smile at skies Wrathe. II.v. Happy to muche the formar age With faithful fild content, Not lost by sluggy lust, That wonts the long fastz To louse by son got acorne, That knew not Baccus giftz With molten honey mixed Nor Serik shining fleece With Tirius venom die. Sound slipes gave the grasse, Ther drink the running streme, Shades gave the hiest pine. The depth of sea they fadomd not, Nor wares chosen from fur Made stranger find new shores. Than were navies stil, Nor bloudshed by cruel hate Had fearful weapons staned. What first fury to foes shuld Any army rayse Whan cruel woundz he saw And no reward for bloude? Wold God agane our formar time To wonted maners fel! But gridy getting loue burnes Sorar than Etna with her flames. O who the first man was Of hiden gold the waight Or gemmes that willing lurkt The dear danger digd? II.vi. We know how many ruines made, Whan flamed citie and fathers slain, That tirant who ons brother kild Imbrued with mothers bloude, With looke oueruewed her body cold. No teares bedewes his face, but was A domar of dedded beauty. The same yet with sceptar peple ruled, Evin suche as son espies at furdest west From the orison come, Whom frosty seven stars ouerlookes, Whom wrothful north with drie heat Affraies in sithing of the burning sandz. Could all his lofty power at lenghe Turne the rage of frantique Nero? O grevous hap whan wicked sword To cruel venom joingnes! II.vii. Who so with hedlong mynd glory Alone belives as greatest thing, And quarters of largist hevens behold With straightid seat of erthe, Wyl blusche that hit not filz The short compas of gridy desire. Why, proud men, do you crake Your necks from mortal yoke retire? Thogh fame by people strange Flying spred the tonges open, And noble house by great titelz shine, Death hates the hiest glory, Intangles low and hauty hed And equalz lest to most. Wher now lies faithful Fabritius bones? Wher Brutus or currish Cato? Small lasting fame signes A vaine name with fewest letters. But why do we know noble names, Do we not see them to consumed? Ly you shal unknowen at all, Nor fame shal uttar who. If you suppose that life be longar drawen For brethe of mortal fame, Than the second dethe exspect. II.viii. That world with stable trust The changing seasons turnes And divers sedes stil holdes league, That ?ebus the ruddy daye With golden car bringes furthe, That mone may rule the night Wiche Hesperus broght, The gridy sea her streame In certaine limites kipt, That lawful be not to wide world To bancke her spatius boundz: Al this hole molde ties In ruling erthe and sea Loue ruling hevens. Who if the raines he slake, What so now by loue is linked Straict maketh war And seakes to wracke that worke Whiche linked faithe Hit quiet motions moued. He in holy peace doth hold The bounded peoples pact, And linkes sacred wedlok With chast goodwyl, Who lawes his owne To true associates giues. O happy humain kind, If loue your mindz The same that heuen doth rule Mygh gide. III.i. Who frutfulst fild wyl sowe, First fried of fruit must he make his leas, With sithe must fern and busches cut, That Ceres may swel with new sede. The flies labor swetar is, If strongar tast be first eate. As Luci?ar dothe the darkenis chase, A fayre day spurs on the ruddy hors. Thou, looking so on falsed good, Begin thy neck from yoke to pluck. Therby thy mind may true obtain. III.ii. How many raines of causis gideth Nature powreful, by which the great World with lawes provident kepes And tijnge, strains with unlousing Knot eche thing, wel pleases with shirllest Note expres with drawing strings. Thogh A?ricke lionnes faire Gives beare and takes giuen food with paw And cruel kipar feares the wonted stripes that bare; If bloud haue ons dyed ther looke Ther courage retournes to formar state, And with rorings lowde them selues remembring, Slacks from tied knots ther necks, And furius first with cruel tothe On kipar raging wrathe bestowes. The chatting bird that sings on hiest bow, In holow den is shut is she. To this, thogh cups with hony lined And largest food with tendar loue Beguiling care of man bestowes, If yet skipping on the eues Spies pleasing shady wood, With fote she treds her skatterd meat, In sorowing seakes the woodz alone, And with swit vois the trees resountz. The twig drawen ons with mighty fors Bowing plies her top; The same if bending hand do slack, The top upright doth turne. The son to Hesperius waters falz, But by secret pathe againe His cart turnes to est againe. Each thing sekes owt his propre cours And do reiois at retourne ther owen, Nor ordar giuen to any remains Onles he joinges to end his first And so stedyes his holie round. III.iii. Thogh riche man with flowing golden golfe Couetous hepes not rechis that suffice, His neck adornes with geme of reddis sea, With hundred oxe the fruitful fildz doth til, Yet eating care leues him not quicke, Nor ded the fliting good accompagnies. III.iv. Thogh the proude man with Tirius shelles Be dekt and shining stone, Hated yet of all liued Nero For cruel lust. But ons thogh wicked he gaue Vnmete curules to reuerent fathers. Who yet happy thoght them Whom wicketz sort estemed? III.v. He that sekes mighty be, Cruel myndz must tame, Nor won with lust his neck Filthy raynes subdue. Thogh India soil far of At thy lawes do shake, And uttermost island Serue the to, Yet is hit not thy powre Hiden cares expel, Nor wretched mones Expulse thou canst not. III.vi. Al humain kind on erthe From like beginninge comes: One father is of all, One only al doth gide. He gaue to son the beames And hornes on mone bestowed, He men to erthe did giue And signes to heauen. He closed in limmes our soules Fetched from hiest seat. A noble sede therfor broght furth All mortal folke. What crake you of your stock Or forfathers old? If your first spring and auther God you view, No man bastard be, Vnless with vice the worst he fede And leueth so his birthe. III.vii. All delight hathe this with hit, With stinge in joyars hit Like to winged flies, Whan hony the haue made, Away the go and with stikking Bite, the stinged hartes strikes. III.viii. O in how begiling pathe Men ignorance leades. Seake not the golde in griny tre Nor look for precious stone on grape; Hide not on hily tops your baites Your dische with fische to fil, And gotes if thou wylt take The tyrrhene sea not serche. For hid in the waues man knoes the waters stream, And what fiersist riuer haue whittist pearle, Or wher the reddys rubies And shores also fild most with smallist fische Or haue most porpos skales. But hiden for they know not The good the seake, Blindid ignorant must the bide To cerche byonde the northen pole, Drowned in the erthe the rake. What hest shall I for dullardz make? Euen this, that whan with carke the falz haue got, Truist than shalt knowe The best. III.ix. O thou in lasting sort the world that rulest, Of erthe and heauen the framar, who time from first Bidst go and stable stedy all elz dost while, Whom outward causis forst not to forme The worke of sliding substance, but shape Of greatest good that envy wantz, thou al By hiest sample gides: the fairest thou, The goodlist world that mindst, and of like mold hit made, Bidding the perfaictz the complete parts performe. In number thou elementz ties, as ryming cold To melting flames be ioingned: lest purest fire faile Or waights to drowned land befall. Thou binding the soules spirite the moues Al that concernes the triple nature And dost deuide them into agrying limmes. Who cut in circles two the motion glimmers, And brething to her selfe retournes The dipe mind bisetz and alike heauin rules. Thou with like cause the soules consernes And liues that meanar be to swiftist wains, Thou fitting hiest spirites In heauen and erthe dost sowe, Whom with a gentil law to the retourned Thou makest be broght to fire from whence it came. Grant that the mynd, O father, climb to thy hiest seat. And on thy vew the clirest sigh may set. Away cast erthely cloude and waight of this mold, Do thou with lustar then them grace. Thou art the cleare and quiet rest for best folke, The to admire is first, last, help, gide, Pathe and stedy last. III.x. Al you togither come that taken be, Whom begiling lust with wicked chanes hath bound, Dabeling the erthely myndz; Here rest of labor shal you haue, Here open sanctuary for wretches alone. Not al that Tagus with her golden sandz Doth give, or Hermus with her glittering shore, Or Indian dwelling nire to hottische circle, That griny stone with clirist doth mixe, So clires the sight, nor more the blindid mindz Returnes into ther shades. What of al thes hathe pleased and delited, That erthe hathe kept in darkist caue: The lustar that doth gide the heauen and rule, The ruines dark of soule forbidz. This light he who can decerne Beauty suche in ?ebus beames denies. III.xi. Who so the trueth with deapest mynd doth sirche And sekes by no bywais awry to stray, Into him selfe returne the light of newar mynd, And longe discours straining to a round, And teach his mynd what so without he seke, Layd up amonge his treasure let him kepe. Lately that which blacky cloud hathe dimmed, That lightar shal thou shine out. For not al light from mynd hath drawen The body carying a forgetful waight. Ther stiks, I trowe, an inward sead of trothe Wiche kindlez best by learnings belowes. For axed why do you the right desire, If instinct in thy hart ther wer not? If Platoes musis tales the trueth, That eche man lernes Forgetting he remembars. III.xii. Blist that may of good The fontane clire behold, Happy that can of waighty Erthe the bondes to breake. The Tracian profit wons His wives funeralz wailing Whan with sorows note The wauering trees he moued, And stedy rivers made, And hind caused join Unfearing sides to lion fierce, Nor hare did feare the looke Of cruel dog so plised with song. Whan ferventar desir the inward Brest more burnt, Nor could the notes that al subdued Pacifie ther lord, Of ireful gods complaining, The helly house went to. Ther faining verse, Tuning to sounding stringe What he drew from springes The greatest of mother gods, What feable mone could giue, What doubled love afourd, Bywailes and hel doth stur With dulce suite pardon Of darkenes lord besiche. Wondar doth the thre hedded Jailor, amasid with unwonted verse; Revenging goddes of faultes That wontid guilty feare, Sorowing with tears bedewed the were. Not Ixiones hed The whirling while did turne, And lost with longue thirst Tantalus riuers skornes. The vultur fild with notes Tityus livor tared not. At last wailing said the juge Of shady place: We yield; To man we giue his wife for feere, Won by his song. With this law bound be the gift, While in Tartar thou bidest Turne back thy looke thou must not. But who to loue giues law? For greatest law his love he made. So, night drawing to her ende, Eurydicen his Or?eus Sawe, lost and killed. This fable toucheth you, Who so doth seak to gide To hiest day his mynd. For who in hely shade Won man his yees doth bend, What so he chifest held In vewing hel hathe lost. Et sic bene. IV.i. For spedy quilles haue I That fur aboue the pole do reache, Wiche whan my fliinge mind putz on, Hating the erthe despice hit. And hiar hies than erthes globe, And cloudes behind me see, And pas aboue the fiars top With swiftnis that the heavens heat, Until to starry house hit comme With ?ebus sorteth way, And soldiar made of shining star Cold Saturne doth felowe, Or wher the shewing night The circle round doth make. And whan got ynough she hathe, The owtmost pole he leues, And worthy made of hiest light Presseth the waight of spidy skie. He, lord, holdz of kings the septar And raines of world doth gide, And stable rules the spidy cours, Of all the noble juge. Hither if the way back do bring the, Wiche now forgetting thou requirest: This, wilt thou say, my country is, I know. Hens came I, hire wyl I stay my step. And if of erthe hit plese the The darkenes left to vewe, The grimme lookis that people dredeth so Of banissed tirants shalt behold. IV.ii. Thos wiche you se as kings Sit in y? top of hiest seat, Florishing with purple fayre, Invirond with dreadful armes, With ireful looke that thretes, For hartz yre scant drawing brethe. If any take from wicked men Of false honor the couer, Within shal se ther lordz Straightened giues to beare. Hither lust them drawes, Hire ire ther myndz afflictz, Who sturred raiseth stormes, Sorow or the taken wers, Or slippar hopes tourment. Wherfor whan one hed So many tirantz beares, He doth not that he wold, Prest with so wicked lordz. IV.iii. Ulisses captaines sailes And sailing ships in sea Eurus to iland broght. The goddis feare sitting, As borne of ?ebus line, To her newe gestz The charmed cup doth giue. Wiche as in divers sortz Herber rular gides her hand, This man the bores snout do couer, Another the Marmican lion With tuske and paw indueth. This like to the wolfe nv borne, Whan wepe he wolde, he houles. Another as Indian tigar Walkes in his house as mild. Thogh from many euelz The winged Arcadian god Pitying the besiged captaine From gestz plague preserved, Yet wicked cup the sailars With mouthes supte up, And swin changed Ceres corne For foode of acorne chosen. Of lost men naught remained Of body or of voyce. Only ther mynd stable aboue Whan the monstars suffar, wailes. O hand to weke nor herbes of power, Thogh limmes to change, Hartz yet alter may not. Whithein bides men strengh, Hid in his towre. Thos venoms with more fors Man from himselfe withdrawes, Who, thogh the body not, The soule with woundz assailes. IV.iv. What boutes hit make so great strife And with thy hand thy dethe procure? If dethe you seake, she draweth ny Agreyng, not abides the winged horse. Whom serpent, lion, tigar, beare and bore With bite do seake, with blade your selues pursue. That properties agre not but do difar, Ar they the cause of wicked strife and war, And perish wold with weapon diuers? No just meane of cruelty ynough. Fit mede woldest thou giue desartz? Of right the good do loue, the yl bemone. IV.v. If man know not how stars The Arcture next by hyest poles doe slyde, Nor why Bootes slow glydes by y? wane And sluggy flames in sea doo dip, When her swift rysings to soone performs, Of hyest heauens the law will muse. Of fulled moone the hornes whitenid Infected with y? bounds of darkest night. And such as with her shyning face were shaded Dymmed Pheba those stars discouer; A common error folkes assayles, And brasen tymbrells stryke with many strokes. None musith that the southest wynd With hurling waue astones the shore, Nor that y? hardnid snowy ball by cold By feruent heate of sonne resolues. For ready is the cause of y?? be seene, But hydden causes whyrls y? mynd. Such as our age scarce knowith lyke And vulgar fleete at souden gase. Let cloudy faulte of error giue his place And wonders sure be seene shall cease. IV.vi. If wary alone of thundering God y? lawes thou wilt With purest mynde beholde, Of hyest heauen the top doe vewe. There planets, with justest league of all, Agreement old doo kepe. The sonne, styrd up by ruddy fyre, Phebas frosy axill tree ne letts, Nor that beare that on y? top of the world A running course doth bend, That neuer other stars wet beholding Dround under western depth is touched, And seketh not with flames the sea to hit. Ever with equall turne of tyme Hesperus showes y? later shades, And Lucifer retournes y? fayrest day. So interlaced looue renewes The eternall courses all, So jarring warr from starry sky made outlaw. The elementz all accord tempars In equal sort, that striving Moisteurs to droughts [by] turnes giue way, That the coldz kipe faithe with flames, And hanging fire upward bend. And heuy erthe with waight bow downe. By seluesame cause in milddist springe The flowring yere his sauors yeldz, Hottist sommer corne doth ripe, And fruitful autumne apples beares, Dripping showres wintar moistz. This temper feedes and brings fourth What so lyfe in world doth brethe. The same snatching makes and plucks away By the last gasp ending spring. The maker hye meane while sitts, Ruling bends of all y? raynes, King and lord, spring and first Lawe, and wise, of just y? judge, And such by styrring as he rayses, Backdrawing stayes, and wandring keeps. For but returning rightest lynes Again he bent to bowing wheels The order that now stable keeps Disseuerd all from spring wold faynte. Such is y? common loue of all, That with returne, for end of good be kept. In other sort endure they could not, Unles agayne by loue returnd Back to the cause that made them bend. IV.vii. Twis fiue yeres wratheful Atride made With ?risians ruines war, The unchast bed of brother so revenged. He, while hoissing sailes to Grecians ship he gaue, With wische and bloud the windes apeced; Dispoiled of fathers care, the cruel priest His daughtars throte of life deprived. Vlysses wailed his lost peers Whom bloudy Pole?emus in his large den Gulped down unto his cruel panche, And furius yet with his yeles hed His joy repaid with woful teares his owne. Hardy labors his Hercules did grace. He centaurs proude did tame, Of skin the lion flead, With certain shaftes the birdz did hit, Snatched aples from the looking dragon, His left hand peaced with golden metal, Cerberus with threfold cheane doth drawe. A victor he is said to set the lord for meat To cruel forefoted bests. Hidra killed by venom sered, Achelous streame with firy looke Drowned under the shore his shamed face. Anteus he strake undar the Libeans sandes, Cacus apesed Euanndars wrothe And shuldars those wiche by heauens shuld pres The bore the same with folme did marke. The last labor heauen beareing with nek unboued The heauen decernes for labors pane. Forward go that stronge be wher hiest way Of graetest sample bides. Why, sluggardz, baks do you tourne? The erthe won, the heauens he Giues. V.i. Near the craggs of Achemians rock wher turned to folowars Brests the flying warior dartz doth throw, From one springe Tigris eke Eu?rates arise, Strait by waters parted soundred be; Who met and in one cours reclaimed, The streame that eache depthe drew agries. Let top sailes meet and trunckis by currant drawen And mixed waters fil the changing cours, And suche falz as bending erthe hath skattered A running ordar of falling gulfe ordars. So what so seame by slakning ranes to slip Chanchis bit yet indures and by a law goes on. V.ii. Cleere Phebus with purest light The honnyed mouth of Homer sings. Who yet y? deepe bowells of earth and sea With weake sight of beames pears not, Not so of the great world the framar. Gainst him that al from hy doth view No waight of erthe may resist, Not night with darkist clouds ganesays. In moment stroke his mynd all sees, What wer, what be, what shal bifall, Whom sole alone for that he al espies Truly the may sole call. V.iii. What disagrijng cause the bond of all things breakes? What god suche wars twixt two trothes makes, That what so coupled singly agree The selfsame mixt must be disionyed? But discord none among the truthes befals, And certain sure vnto themselues do stik? But mynd opprest by blindid limmes Can not by flame of overwhelmed light The smal knots of al things finde. But why with suche desire doth true mynde seake The hiden causes of thinges serche out? Knowes he that gridely to knowe he wyls? Why strives he to knowe agane the had? If ignorant he be, why blindid things seakes he? For who that wischeth that knowes not what, Or who foloweth that he wots not? Or how may he finde, or found knowe Suche forme of wiche he knowes not shape? And whan he viewes the hyest mynd, The chief and al togither may he get? But now the mynd, hid in limmes cloudes, Hath not of al forgot his owne, And, thogh the partz be lost, retaines the hed. Who euer seakes the trueth to knowe, Of nether sort is rightly called, For nether al doth knowe or ignorant of al, But top of al retaining kipes by whose aduis, From hy the seen draweth that bettar he may The partz forgot the kept rejoingne. V.iv. Ons in the porch wer broght in men Of obscure line, and old the wer, Who sens and image out of lest motes In mens myndz ingrauen beliue, As oft haps the running stile In sea paper leue, Some printid lettars stik, That marke haue none at all. But if the mynd by her owne raigning Expris by motions naught, Saue only patient lies Subjiect to bodies markes And vain the fourmes Glaslike of all doth make. Whenche this that in our mynd raignes Knoweledge of al discernes? What power al beholdz, Who the knowen deuides? And knowing eache way Now lifts on hie the hed, Than falz to lowest thinges, Than gathering in hit selfe With truethe fals rebukes? This is the making cause Wiche much more mightiar is Than suche as only material markes Receaues with her owne prints. But yet a passion doth begin and sturs The myndz fors while body liues, Whan ether light the yees doth hit, Or sound in ear doth strike. Than sturred strengh of mynd What figures within hit holds Joigned like he cals, Applies them to the outward knowen, And fancies mixe to formes That hiden rest within. V.v. In how many shapes pas beastes on ground, Of wiche of bodies long the dust some turnes With fors of brest contin[u]ed trace doth trail, Some whos swiftnis wings the windz do part And strait the bredhth of largist skie doth pas, Some on ground ther steps to print reiois, Or griny fildz to pas, or woodz to haunt. Whos formes thogh thou see difar far, Yet downe face thers ther dullid sencis. Mankind alone his hed upward bendz, At eas doth stand with body clad and erthe lookes on. This figure warns, but for the clays deceat, That thou with liftid looke that heauen aspiring upcast thy he[d], On hy thy mynd shuldst raise, lest overwaid Thy body made aloft, thy mynd shuld Lowar sit. HORACE'S ART OF POETRY (LINES 1–178) If to a mans hed a pantar wold A horsis neck conjoine And coulored fethers ad therto With limmes togither set, That face aboue of woman faire, The rest fowle like the moudy fische; For suche a hap, my frindz, Could you your laughtar kipe? Belive me, Pisons, euen to this tablet That my book be like, Whos vane shapis shalbe faned, As sik mans dreames be wont, So as nor fote ne hed in one agrie. An iniud power bold the poet and the pantar had. We knowe this lein, axe and giue the same. Not so the wild and tame do pere, Nor of the birdz that serpent bride, Nor lambes fal from tigres tetes. Oft to beginnings graue and shewes of great is sowed A purple pace, one or more for vewe, Whan wood or aultar Dians aught be drawen, Or crake of running streames in fairest fildz, Than pant the riuer Rene or rainbow seak, But for al thes hire is no place. You can perchance the cipers trie present, What botes to pant for gayne a foteles man From broken kile to swim to shore. A pot ful large was ment be maid: How hapned than the while a pipkin framed? In time let be what so thou wilst So that hit plain and one remain. Of poets greatist part, O father, and youthes worthy of your sire, All be begiled by shewe alone of good. While brife to be I striue, skars understode I am, And treting maters slite, I feale my strengh decay; Professing causis dipe, my shalowe mynd astons, And criping low on ground, to safe yet fearing flawe. Who so one thing expres in to to many sortes, A dol?in on the tries doth hange and bore in streame. So flight from fault fals into lack from want of art. A sely smith in Emilius stage play in bras Wil nailes and silky heare with his pensel shape. Vnhappy man in chifist part of worke, For wanting of skil to pictur all he cannot. Self same am I, if aught I striue compound, No more I wische than wondar of iuel formed nose, Or vew of blackist yee with here of likist hue. Take you that write a matter suche as equalz best your skil And long do pause on what your shuldars doe refuse Or what the beare may best: who that he chuse best understands, Nor eloquence shal he want nor ordar cleare. For grace and vertu shal he place, or forbeare, So as what now be said or what hirafter shal Much he defars and for the present time omitz. This loue he doth, this skorne of promised vers the skribe. In placing wordz, if thou be skant and wary bothe, The spiche shal florische wel and be estimed. Yea, if a new word for old wel sodered thou do place, Yea, and nide be with new shewe the hiden yore expound, To frame may hap some wordz that girdled Cethes lack, A license thou with shamfest leue mast take. The new made wordes and faned like credit beares, If from the Grikis spring the softly be withdrawen. But Romane what to Plauto and Cicilius shal he giue, If from Varios loue or Virgil hit be caught? Why, if I litel get, nide enuid I to be, Whan Caton and Ennius toung inriched ther weany spiche, And new names to ther matters gaue? Hit lawful is and euer shal, a word assigned by mark to know. As primar leues of wood first faule and chaunge to nirest yere, So eldred age of wordz turnes so to ther decay, And youngmen like the borne first florische and increas. To dethe we owe ourselves and all we haue. Whether Neptune by erthe receued, And baying in by northern winde the sailing ships, Wiche is a worke and act for kinge; Or wither a coustumed marische fit for ores Fede the cities nire and makes them feale the plowes waight, Or streame change the cours, the fo to frutes, By learning bettar way. All mortal dede shal end, Nor shal our wordz knowe honor augh nor liveliste grace. Much shal renue that haue bine fallen, and than decay Suche wordz as haue bine reuerenst wel, if vse hit grant, On whose beck bothe fors and fourme of spiche dependz. How kingz and chiftanes actz and eke ther doleful woe, In verse how the in numbar be exprest Homere hath told. With onjvend linked vers at first a mone the make, But after winning wische ther verdit the haue won. What author yet wil simple eglogs leue, The grammars mastars striue, yet iuge the verdit kipes. Rage with his owne stile Archilocas hath used. This manner vers the comidantz and tragike bothe begun Wel fitting wordz for bothe, exciding vulgar shoutes And mitist for the greatist, waightist cause. Our muse comitz to stringe bothe gods and ther race, The winning wrastlar, and hors the first at stop, And telz the youngmens cares and frechat wines, Thes changes to obserue and coulors shewed of work. If I knowe not nor care, why poete am I called? By sely shame chuse not to knowe than sike vs lerne. A mery play wold not admit a tragik vers; Thiestes scene disdaines that wordiest vers decerns, Be told in menar verse by pourist comidant. Let all things be as sorteth best ther place. Yet comedie sometime lifts vp the voice, And wrotheful Cremes with puffed face fights, And tragik often moues in slavy gise. Tele?us, eke Pelius, wh[en] poore and exul bothe, Away throw the thes windblowen vase And halved quartered vers, do care, If care the do, with mone the loukars on to move. Versis faire do not suffice, let them be swite And suche as wher the wyl may turne the hirars eare. As mery man the please, so wailing man contentz The milddy lookes. If teares myne thou procure Thyself must waile, so shal thy misfortune yerk me. Ivel if you do your biddings place, Tele?us or Peleus, or I shal slipe or laughtar make. For sory wordes fitz best a moning face, The furius thretful, seuere the dalear, wanton the graue, For nature first us fourmed within ful fit, For the bent of eche fortune helpes or throwes to er[the], In yrking drawes vs downe with wo opprest, Strait motions of the minde exaltz by toung exprest. If speakars wordz unfit ther fate, The army all with skorne wil the deride; For much hit doth auaill whir Dauus or Eros, Or ripid age or firs youthe in growing yeres, Or ruling dame or careful nurse, Wayfaring marchant, or plower of the griny fild, In Colchis or Assyria bred, in Thebes or Argus town. Or hiresay folowe, or writar, make thy matter fit for the. Laudid Achilles do thou prais, hedy, ireful, graue, lerne [shipp]. Lawes he denies euer made for him, naugh must gainsay thy armes fors. Medea let be woode vnwon, Ino ful of teares, Faithless Ixion, wandringe Io, mourning Orestes. If ignorant thou aught to the scene committ, And darest new actors place perfourme, Suche as thou first began, louke to the end thou kipe. Ful hard hit in private sort the comme thing declare, And rightliar shuldst thou Homers vers expres, Than as first man the vntouche and vntold tel. General mattar shal be made thy private part, If thou stik not to curius about the base and commen lines, Nor word by other like glosar sure shalt thou vse, Nor skolar like shalt thou sample thyself in act, Whence shame forbidz thy foote eke lawe of work, Nor so begin as Ciclicus writar ons: The luk of Priam shal I sing and worthy war. What fitting so wiede chawes hathe promis now perfourmed? The hilz ther frute do yeld, a skorned mouse is born. How rightliar he that fondly naught doth vndertake. Shew me, my muse, a man in after tims of taken Troy The manars of many a man that saw togither with their towns. Who miss not smoke of flame but light from smoke to giue, That thens he may shewe wondars great: Anti?aton, Silla, and with Ciclop Caribid. Nor Diomedz return from Meleagris ruine, Nor Trojans war from his grandfathers shel wil tel. Euer to end he hies and to best menes. Like as by notes the listenars eares he drawes, That he despaires, intreting grace, he leues; And so begiles as fals with tru doth mixe, That midst to first and last with midst agrie. Thou, what I and people desire do, hire. If nide you do a praisar, to the end such as wil bide Til singar do afourd your clapping hands to work, Than must thou maike the manars of eche age, And graunted must be grace to natures changed yeare. The boy that can pronounce his wordz And stedy his ground with sure pace Lips for joy to felowe his like, Sturs vp his color, lets hit light fal, And changes oft in many a houre. The berdles youthe, at last mastar cast of, Joys in horsis, dogges, and gras of open fild; Waxlike rolled to vice, to teachar curst, Late forsear of good, of his pence to lavische, Hauty, glorius, swift winged to leue that he loved. But eldar age, turning his cours with mynd manlike, Riches sikes, frindz, to honor himself ingrafing, Wel warning to do that strait to change he strives. Cumbars many a one besige the aged man; Or that he sikes thogh found as wretche he forbears And dares not ventur the vse therof; Or that in feare or yoy al thing he vndertakz, Slowghful a hoper, ydel, and gridy of change, Crabbid, whining, the praisar of passed time Whan boy he was, a juge and beatar of his youngar. Growing yeres great auailes do bring, And passed gone as many do deprive. Lest, therfor, agid part be giuen vnto the young And mans estate bequived to the boy, Let vs abide in suche as best agre and in ther time. PLUTARCH'S ON CURIOSITY [1] Perchance hit might be best to shun at al that home Wher throughout the wind passage none can get, Or dimmed darke or subiect to the cold and windz, Or els to siknis thral that bredeth helth decay; But if so one delight by costom in such place The lights may changed be, or staiers alter case, Or dores some for the passage, some other shutted be, Wiche fayrar muche may frame hit cleare with bettar helth. And some have served ther cities turne by altering suche. A sample may my country make, as said hit is, That bending to Zephirus wynde and from Parnasus taking sone, That to y? west his course did turn by Cherons help, Hit wryed was to east, the sons arising place. Empedocles eke, the knower wel of naturs cours, Is said to stop the gaping deap of hil and the rok Wiche grevous was and siknys ful the place, For that the northen wind did beat on neagbours filds, And thus the plage out chast from regions ground. Therfor if plagy wilz ther be that noyful ar unsound, Arising tempest great and dimly marks the mynd, Best shal hit be giue them repuls and down throw flat to ground; So to ourselues we bride an air clear, a ligh and brethe ful pur. And if this may not be, yet let our labor at lest be this, That by al menes that possible make we may, Tourning from us and changing al [that] brideth us offence, We make them serue our tourne and helpe us the beste. A sample let us make of curius nideles care, Whose study is naugh else but other homes to knowe, Diseas that nether void of enuy nor pure from wickedn[is]. Why than, O man, with enuye ful an others yls Sharpist sight dost set, and in thyn owin stil? Inward drawe thy science study and so hit apply That thy busy care be tourned from outward to thyn own. And if thou fancy haue to enter storyes yvels, Thou hast ynough at home that ydel thou ne be. As great a stream as waters floud doth bring to bay, Or circled oak by fawling leves from tre. So great a store of faultes in thy life shalt find, A hepe eake of yl desiars fraught in thy mynd. No les neglect of that thou shuld by office yeld. For as the writ of Seno? on telz the ordar how good frugal men Do part aside suche laid up stuf as sacrifice nides, And do deuide from banquetz cost, in sort that some Do serue the plowshares turne, in other place the war; Euen so do thou deuide thy ivels part that enuy bridz, A part let ielosy haue, some for cowardz frute do leue, For sparing some, reserue all the do count and know. Suche windowes as to neghbours hous giues the vewe, And curius foote steps make a way to patent; But other wayes open thou must, truly fit and sound, Suche as to seruauntz romes in thy hous the bring, Sometime into thy womens closetz and wher thy slaues abide. Thes be suche thing as axing study and busy care do nide, Wher never profitles businis nor wicked work hath rome, But ful of welth and holesum councel giues the, Whan eache telz himself this tale and this accompt: Whens slide I, what done haue I, what ther vndon shuld not? [2] But now, as fables tell, Lamia at home doth blindedly: Her yees she putz in vesselz store til furthe she go. Than in her hed the go, and open bendz her lookes. So eache man abrode in others matters with hate Into his thoght a curius regard into his head as yee he putz. From faultz our owne and wicked actz by ignorance we slip; On thes nor rolling yees nor light of them receue. The curius more profit yeldz his foes than good vnto himself, That telleth them ther lacks, and wher the do, and That bettar the may ware the warnid to correct, Neglectz at home the dedes that nide wer to regard, So stoned is his care for that most other touche. Vlisses eke no word wold giue to mother his Til of the pro?et axed he had the cause, why to hel he went; And after he to dame returned and wemen rather axed What wenche Tiro was, wher faire Cloris bid, And what bred cause for murthering Epicastes life, Whan woful knot of corde she knitz to hiest beame. But we ouer secure and knowing naugh that most us touche, Inquires of others liues: as why our neghbors sire A Sirian was and grand dame why a Thresian borne, And suche man owes talentz thre nor usury hath paid. Yea, and sometime suche things discours, whens suche a wife leaue home, Why he and he haue in a corner talkt togither. But Socrates romed up and downe with doute ful great, What wordz, what spiche Pitagoras vsid to bride belife; And Aristippus in Olimpias meting Ischomachus axed Why Socrates in his disputes so wyn could yonge men. Who whan he picked had some sedes and samples of his wordz, So moued he was, that skant he stedy cold his pas, And grew throughout bothe pale and lene, until Thirsty and inflamed to Athenes hoissed vp his sailes, And bothe the man his wordz and ?ilo?ie he lerned, Wiche did contain in somme to all conclude in short That al men shuld an audit make of al ther iuels And so them bettar knowe to make them shun the more. [3] An other sort ther is that broke can not a louk On life ther owne, but demes hit as a yrcksome shewe, Nor reasons lustar beare the can, reflections hers the shun, But ther mynd filld all with eache mans iuel al shaking dreads. What dwels within abrod hit goes and gasith round about, And others sins do vew, bothe nurs and crame ther vice. For as the hen oft in the house whan food is broght Runs to a cornar strait and ground doth skrape with claw, That some wher in the dounge on grain at lest may find, So fareth hit with curius mans vice, who passing ouer Institutes, lessons and skanted matter in retorik give, And other caus suche as no man grives is axed, In hepes the throw the housis secret iuels and hid. Righ wel applied is that the Egyptian said to him that axed What hid was that he had. That made hit hid, quoth he. Nor is hit the fasyon to enter others house with out he afore knoke; Though now the portars add to for harmerling, and rings did hange Vntouchet with out, served for the eare from him that enter wold, Lest stranger migh the huswife in her house surprise Beting of her maid or chastening her man, Or shirles might heare that maiden gaue for skourge. The prying man to all this wyl slily make his one, Suche one as hedes not to behold a chast and wel ruuld hous, No thogh a man in treating sort wold cal him to that sight; But suche as kay requires, a clog or sparred dore Vncouver list, and to the vulgar sort abrode hit migt. Of all the wyndz the greue us most and troble bride, Ariston telz, whos turne back strawes vs anoy, But curius man no neghbors cloak nor clothes estimes, But wales he brekes and opens dores, euen to sily maidz, In sort euen suche as wind that perceth in and enters rome Wher Bacchus feasts, roundz and daunce he may behold, Euen suche as in the night to Dianes temple dedicate were, With hedy yea espies what faultz he may find ther. [4] Besides, as Cleon sais, whom comedie old reproved, His mynd in Clopis was, his handz in Etole hid. So mynd of curius man at onis in riche mans hous doth make abode And in self time the cotage poor doth haunt and court of king. And at a wedding latly made to prie the businis of eache man, Bothe of the gestz that biddid be and of the chifest all. And so as not of peril he ventur makes therof, But like to him that henban tast with curius fault, That gridy is to knowe afor he fele is reued of his like: So who serche the mightiars ylz first dy or understand, For who disdains to looke on sun beames large and windo And nides wil star on bodies sun hit selfe to bold that striue The light from him to turne, are blinded starke for here. Rightly said ?ilippides the poete to Lisimachus who axed: What of myne shal I imparte as of my gift to the? What so thou wylt, quoth he, so secret none thou giue me. For what so kingdome hathe of pleasur and ioy Outward set furthe be: banquetz, riches, solemne liberal shewes; But if hid aught ther be, nor hit assist ne ons hit touche. Nor coverd be a kingly ioy whan prosperous hap arrives, Nor scorne made at his sportz nor whom with bringeth kindly gifts. What hidden is fearful, woful, sower and vnknowen, The tresor of an ouerflowing wasting ire, Or rather habit deape in mynd to rolle revenge, Or zelosie of wife or sons suspect or dout of frind. Fly thou this darke and thikky mysty folded cloude; A flasche and thoundar shal burst out whan hidden shewes. [5] What way therfor for fligt or shuning of the same? If strait thou do as said is yore to spare thy busy care, But best if mynd thou turne helpz and delites. O busy man, cherche what the heauen, erthe, air and sea afourdz. Wither doth delite the most, the small or great to knowe? If great, than care whens son arise and wher she doth couche, Aske why the mone at times as man so changeth she, Whence so great light she tooke and whens she lost repairs. Whan left she hathe us semed how may hit be That strait her new face faire to vs aperes Slily to the circles ful increasing makes Again whan beauty hers hathe shone unto the top Than waning eldar growes til none be shewn. For thes thingz be naturs secret inward workes, Nor doth disdaine suche science to the lerned folke. But great thinges thou despice and dost not reke serche? Be curius than for things of les regarde. Aske thou than of that wiche erthe brings furthe, Why some do florisshe stil and grine remaine, In euery season grine the be as she that bosts herself, Some other sort in some what like to thes the shew, Some other kind be bared left and lea, like husbandman That thrift neglects at ons that al his goodz hathe spent; For nether iust, honist nor pleasing wer suche shewe. Than why do divers grondz brede fruts of sondry sortz, Both long, cornard, halfe round and rounded all? Perchance of this thou carest not muche, for yl non is. If nides thou sekest in ivels a curius care, Iven serpent like that fed and nourist is in poisund wood, Let us suche curius man bringe to stories read, And gather ther suche stuf as doth include and tel. A plenty great of al mishaps, aboundance of all ivel, For ther do ly the ruine of men, the wast of goodz, The wifes dishonor, the sarvantz baitz, the frindz slander, The venom prepared, enuies, zelosies, wrak of frindz, The treasons huge of kings from kingdoms thrown. Fil thou with these thy curius nice desiars: Pleasure taken this that bride can no wo, Nor dolor to such folke as thou dost dwell with alle. [6] But as hit semes the curius man cared not for old pane. Not suche as wonted were but sly and unfond harme he vews, That willingly may tragidies new made behold; He recks not for to felowe comiche cause nor mery matter. Than if he mit with one that talk of mariage makes, Or sacrifice telz, or brides retourne, hideles and lasy The curius man hit heares, and tels how oft that he hard, And wilz the tellar be brief in short or pas hit ouer; But if a sittar by do tel a tale of a dishonested maid, Or wife that wedlok brake or cartel sent, or brothers debat, Heare he slipith not nor siuseth makes for laisur, But sekes for more mens tongz and listen makes his eares. How rightly said is this: that easilar il than good to mortal men arrives. And rightly said is this of curius natured man, For as the boxing glas the worst from flesche do draw, So eares of noysy folkes the wor. . .he draweth out. And bettar for to say, as cities haue some gates Vnlucky and void of noys of multitude the great, By wiche condemned men to dy are oft conveied, And throw wiche the throw that filthy is and fowl, And naugh by them ther goes that pure or holy is; So by the eares of curius men naugh good or faire doth pas, But slaughtar talk in to ther eares has passage sure, And ther abides wiche wicked cursed tales them brings. Euer chanting teares within my house do dwell. This is the muse for curius man and siren his alone, Nor aught than this may joy them best or please, For curius folke have gridy wyl to heare that secret is and hid. No such opens, yea to aught, if good the haue at al, And some while the do faine suche good as ther is none. And so the nisy man that gridy is to know the ivel Is subiect to disiase that joyes at others harmes, The bretherne true of spite and enuious folkes. For enuy sorow is for good that others joys, A gladsomnis of ivel, the joy conciued of others wicked actz; And both procides of malice humor, beastlike and mad. [7] But yrksome so vnto eache man the opening is of his ivels That many chuse to dy befor his secret disease the doctor prove. What if Hero?ilus, Erasistratus or Esculapius, choys men therfor, Carying the cures instrumentz, if standing without dores Wher axed wiche fistula in the thigh suche man hathe had, Or wither a wife a cancer hathe in secret hiden place? Albeit the heltheful care be nidful of suche art, Yet no man, I belive, but cast of wold suche on as hit wold axe, Whom no unlouked for nid uncald wold sike out others harme. The busy man sikes out al thes and many wors, That with no mynd to cure, but clattar out the same. Wherfor no nikurne the shal giue that names the cuyrous folk. For serchers we disdain and hardly brooke we can, Not when the find that openly is brought to vew of all But suche as hiden be in vesselz and in packz; And yet the law hit bids, and for neglect shuld smart. In other sort the nice men lose ther owne for others serche, Nor dwell the chuse in country soile, for quiet fildz no care. But yet if after longed time the to the contry goe, The rather vewe ther neighbors fild and pas ther owne; And axis how many oxen he hathe loste in numbar all, And how much sowered wine he cast away with los; And furnist this, he quikly to the citie retournes. But he that is a plowman right receue ful slowly wyl such newes As of fre wyl is from the citie spred abrod, And sais: than wyl fal out my diggar shal tel me tales On what barganes strifes haue ther ende in plea, For even now curius of suche matter this wicked wreche doth walke. [8] But busy man the cloiny life doth hate as empty cold, That nurs no tragicke part woful nor wicked cause, But go the wyl to jugis seates, to markets and to portz, Vsing this vois: have you no newes today, wer ye in fair? What than? Do you belive the cities reuolt in thre hours time? And if such tale he hathe, from his horse he lights, Taking hands, imbrasis the man and listing sits him by. If met he do a man that tel can naugh: what sais thou? Wert thou in pleading place? Didst thou not pas the hal? Nor hast not faln in passangers suche as last from Italye come? Praised be therfor the Locrens law, who did forbid A question ons at his ret any newes And promist was For as to coukes ful welcome is the numbar great of shipe, To fisshar eke spaum ful thik of fische find, So curius men wische plenty of ivel, and businis make New and strange euent, wiche euer the hunt and kil. Yea, hidely do the Thurian lawes, that charge no citizen think In comedie be vsed but to the whoring or curius men. For adultry desiar of other pleasur, inquiry and serch also Of matter such as hid is hardly to be knowen; For curiositie is a palssy and consumption eke that shews what shuld couet, Wiche makes the chatting vice to folow care of knowing muche. [9] And so can not be shuned, but slandar felowes the busy care, Wiche made Pithagoras teche fiue yeres silence to young men, Wiche cal he did ????????, the suafes thing that silence doth expres. Yea, hit can not be but wicked tong doth curiositie fere For what the gladly heare the willingly readely tel, And what with hide from some the yet to others tel delite. Wherfor this disease besides more iuels brings this to bote, That let it doth to haue that most the seke to get; For al men hides them wel and hides them from suche feloship, Nor wyl do aught or say in curius sight or eare But councel defers and businis care for other time appointz, Vntil suche man away him get from companie thers. And if perchance a busy man come in wher secret tale Or earnist aught be don, no nother wise than as the cat In running hides his meat so sknatchz from hand that ready was; So that oft that other here or se may to suche, Nor vewe nor eare may serue ther turnes, In fine, a curius man lacks al confidence or trust, For rather to slaues and strangers charge our lettars we commit Or trust ler than to curius knowen frindes. But Bellero?on not lettars born against himself did open, But hand refrained from kingly writ with tempar suche As he wold do with continenci from his wife. To be a curius man lacks tempar nowhit less Than if adulteres part he plaid as faut no les. To this distempar this is worst that foli madnis hathe. For in neglect of most and commen womens haunt, To the shut and glorious one, perhaps to the deformed, Be caried to: what madnis more or brain siknis may be? So fareth hit with curius folk, who, passing by the fairest shews, Lectors studies and disputes, others lettars breakith up, With eares close to neghbors wales, and whisperars adz Wher seruaunts and women bide, yet not void of ding, But sure euer of slandars mark and infamy. [10] Yea, nideful for suche curius ons to shake of ther disease Remembar what ther gaines haue bene or what ther los. For if, as Simonides said, whan sometime he opened had his deskes, One fild with rewardz ful he found but empty that of thankes; So if man sometime shal serche and open with curius mans bages, Ful of unnideful, vaine and stufd with al vnpleasing thingz, Perchance the first sight wyl him offend whan by al menes He shal make plain how undeliteful, vaine and skornful al the be. Now go on, if entring in to ancient boukes and takes out The worst from them, and bouke he haue so invented, As out of Homeres vers that hedles named be, Or out of tragical solosismz, or out of suche vers As Archilochus againe women lewdely and ful sawsy made, In maner suche him selfe betraing and deciuing; Worthy do you not think him of tragical curs and ban? Ivel may the betide, the sercher out of humain woes! Yea, hit shal not nide tragical curs, for of hit self Vnsemely and fruteles sleing the stooring of others sin; Such citi as that was wiche ?ilip of wikedz wretched men First bilt, named therfor ???????????, as fild ful of yl. Curius men, therfor, while round about the gather and hepe, Not fault of vers or poesy but crimes of other life, Ther faultz and incongruety and about them each A most unpleasing ungraceful tables of other iuels, Wiche ther owne memory fittest instrument maks. For as at Rome some pictures, and yea in dide Formes bold of boyes, of women, the dispise, about the go And bide in market place wher monstars sold be, Vewing and axing for foteles men that armes haue lik cat, Or thre yead men, or suche whos nek is like to camel torne, Or if ther any be of kind that mixture hathe of like Or yuel shapd untimely birth; but if dayly the be broght To suche a sight, short wil ther liking be, and some wyl hit abhor. So suche as curius be of others liues and liuing birth, About the rabel and sins that haue befalne in others hous, Suche as afore the pried on, comes to ther mynd, Remembar the do how of the hede of others yuels The gather haue no credit nor profit any. [11] Hit muche may therfor avail suche maladie to driue, If first from dede may hap alof with vse our self inure, And so may lerne in this motion to tempar giue our self; For disease increase hathe growen by customs use, Wiche els wold turne to wors, if hit had further gone. But how hit may be don of custome let vs speke. Beginningz first be made of easy things sone don And suche as comen haps and vulgar peple vse. For what mad matter passing by monumentz old To neglect to read verse or writ that graffin be, Or what hard thing wer hit to pas by suche skrapings As walz in writing receue, and not read? In silence warning vs that nothing ther is writen That profit or delite may bride vs or to giue vs, But doth remember a writing good, be best frind of ours, Or other like to this, ful vain and fild with toys, Wiche in them selves semes not to hurt in reading, But slily the annoy for briding care to knowe vnnideles thing; And as the huntars rates ther houndz that usith change, And with ther lyans them pluk back and with drawe, And kipes ther sente bothe pure and hole in right chase, That egerlar the firm ther pace and folowe firme, And winding with ther sent the steps of ther game. So aught hit fare with curius man that runs to euery gase In striuing for to see or lift his eare al to hire. Bak kipe him and withdrawe, him selfe reserue for profit more. For as the lions walke with couver clawes and eglis eke ther talon, Lest sharpnis thers and fiersnes to muche the dul, So mynding how al curius care haue sharpist sight And narowly lookes on knowlege of sondry sortz, Let us not hit consume nor blunt in worsar thing. [12] In secund place, let us invre if by an others hous we go Not to louk in nor rolle our yees to that wiche is within In vsing curius serche in stede of other handz, But ready haue Zenocrates saw, that did deny That differens any wer wither fite or hand the house did enter; For guest it is a shame an inner ivel to vewe. For thes be suche in hous most: potz that lie on ground Or maidens sitting stil, but nothing worth or graue. Yet a shame hit is with glanche on suche to bend our yees, And hither turne our witz sharpnis and pliing mynd, For to suche thinges a custom make is wicked. Diogines ons whan saw he did Dio?sipon in Olimpia race In charet caried, not hable to with drawe his yea from woman fair, But bak wrying and turning nek in casting on her looke, Behold, quoth he, a wrestlar stout with wry nek by maid is won. The busy men you may behold to eche shew ther hed the turn about, Whan custom and care hathe made them ready to vewe eche thing. But I suppos that no man ought permit his sence abrode to range Like maiden that no bringing vp hathe had such as wer meet. But whan from myndz care sence is sent to businis wark, Attend suche thingz and quicly tel thy message answer, And than againe in thy selfe with reasone make abodd And ther abide, not strayinge out of office charg. But now hapz that wiche So?ocles wont is tel: And so as freed hors the bit That careles hand of holdar Did neglect. So sence (as we have told) void of a guide or vse, Furthe the go and often drawe the mynd to that and more, At length hurles him down to breke his nek. Wiche makes that falsly said and brakd is of Democratus That of purpos he pluckt out his yees, holding them to fired glas, And from the same reflection tooke, lest that the shuld His mynd kepe shut and oft cal back to outward caus, Not suffering that the shud him let, left them at home, That he migh bode in vnderstandings good, as shutting she[we] From windowes that to hie ways bend ther light. But most tru hit is that rarely the do file what do the shuld, That vexeth oft ther mynd with busy careful thoght. Yea, musis dipe the fur from towne did place, And night as firmest frind to knowledge great The titeld with Euph?onen name, supposing suche vse And ease, whom no other care did let or hindar, Shuld have great helpe to such things as seke the did. [13] Yea, and that is not hard nor cumber hathe therin As oft men ban the or cursing wordes aforde, Nor eare giue therto, but as a defe man hard them; Or whan great pres is in the place to sit the stil, And if thou cans not rule the so, arise and go thi way. For if thou felowe curius folke no good therof thou getz; But profit great shal the bifal if curius part thou shun With violence great, thou vse and vse hit may reason lore. And profit taking from this grounwork and earnestar custom, Right wel shalt do if theatur thou pas wher pleasant augh is plaid, And if thy frindz do the intreat to comedie or game, deny. Or if comen shutz about the ringe, witsafe not. For as Socrates did wel warne us to take hede and beware Of suche meat as did prouoke the unhungrie man, Alike he said of draughtz suche without thrust to take. So we must shun suche shewes and tales as intise and allure Whan nide of them we haue not at all, but ar to muche. Yea, Cirus wold not Panthea behold or vewe, And whan Araspus told him how she worthy was to be seen, That is the cause, quoth he, why more I wold refrain her. Yea, if I shuld thy counsel folowe and go to her, Perhaps she wold perswade me againe to retourne againe, Euen whan my laisur aught not be to sit by her and louke In leauing of more serius hideful matters. In maner suche nor Alexander wold Darius wife behold Whan fame she had of beauty great and praised her muche, But meting mother hers, a woman old, the maiden fair denied. We while ful slily looke in chamber of the wife, Thogh pentische like the windowe built, we think no harm; The curius care our owne we suffar slip, to curius al. [14] Hit profits also sometime that iustice may be don to pas ouer suche ded, That thou mast more accustume the to flie from that as wrong, And that thou mast the bettar invre in continent sort, Sometime forbeare the lawful companie of thi owne wif, Lest another time thou be inticed to other mens. Briding this custom in curiositie, prove sometime that the doth touche, neglect; Nor suffer ons thy eare to give therto a hede, And if a man wold tel the aught don at thy home, diffar him, And from thy eares fur set what wordz of the be said. Edipus busy serche did wrap him in most harmes. For whan of himself he axed, as he no Corinte wez But guest, he met with Laius, who after kild he had, And mother his own in mariage tok, with whom he got kingdom With dowary hers; whan than happy he thoght he was, Againe he questioned who he was, wiche whan his w[ife] wold let, More earnest he, the old man as guilty he wer rebukd, Omitting no good menes to make bewrayd al that was hid. Than whan suspect herof his mynd had moche distract, And old man had skrigd out, O worthi me whom nide to spike constrains; Yeat kindeled and vexed with curiositis stinge made answer: Compeld to heare, yeat heare I must. So swet a sowre hit is, nor may be withstode, curiosities motion, As wound that bloudies hit self while hit is launged. But who is freed from this disease and is of mildy spirit Nor gilty is of any iuel shal thus begin to say: O goddis, how wise art thou, that dost forget the yl. [15] Wherfor against al this a custoum must be made That strait a lettar broght may not be broken vp, As many do, wiche whan the think ther handz to slow the ad to ther tithe. Whenseuer post do come, mete him not, nor let us change our pla[ce]. If so hit hap a frind ariue and say that some what he wyl tel him; Yea, rather if aught thou brings of profit and help. Whan ons in Rome dispute I made, a cloin, that Domitian after kild, Who envied much the princis glory, listening to my lectur And in the while a soldiar comming, Ceasars pistel gaue him, A silence made, whom none wold let to reade the sent, Refuse hit nor wold hit open til endid was my reading, And that I had dismist my hearars and scolars; Wherin eache man did admire the grauitie of this man. But whan by all menes and ways he nurris shal Curiosities maladie and so shal make hit stronge and violent, Than easy is not hit refrain and rule, For that by vse hit throwen is, born to things vnlawful. Yea, the lettars teare vp and frindz secretz discover, And sacred things behold whom no mans vewe aught se, And steps setz in place unfit, and kingly wordz and dedes do serche. [16] And tirans to, who ought al knowe, ar made most odius By thos men who eares thers and flatterars be called. Therfor youngar Darius the first some hirars he had, ?uto?oustas cald, Himself mistrusting, douting others moe and fearing; But Dionisians fuisted amonge the Siracutions suche flering folk Whom in changest state, whan Siracusians found, distroied. For flatterars are of kind and stoke of curius line. And senthars two inquire what ivel another ment or did. Yea, busy men iven wretched haps of neighbors thers do serche, Euen suche as fals vnto ther share though fur vnloukt for wer, And to the vulgar folke hit tel abrode, suche newes the [seke]. And said hit is that wrongged folkes beare suche name of curius vice; For (as like hit was that famine had Athenes plaged, nor ownars wold ther corn vttar, But in night and secret sort grind the did ther store) Thes walking about did note and marke ther milles noys, To wiche ther names were giuen alitern, propar for suche. Of like cause, the say, were sico?antz cald and so surnamed, For whan by law hit was forbid that no man shuld figues gather, Suche as them found and broght to light bar sico?antz name. Yea, that wer not unfit for curius folke to shame them ther, If the knowe them gilty of suche and like andevor as the hold, Wiche hated most and griuous ar to al the haunt.</field>
