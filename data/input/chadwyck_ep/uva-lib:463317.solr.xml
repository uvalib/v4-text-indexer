      <field name="fulltext">Come and se. Ioan. I. This poem has also been attributed to J. Bale and T. Becon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boke to the Reader.The attribution of this poem is questionable. All ye that true catholyks be And loue oure mother holy Church/ Make haste and come hyther to me I will teache you godly to wourche. Doctrine bothe olde and auncient Of father Duns and fryer Thomas/ Shall ye here fynde/if ye be bent To beleue in the blessed masse. Of Christ and his holy Gospel Of true fayth/hope and charite/ I haue nothing at all to tell For that dothe not belong to me. Of the masse is my whole matter And of what great vertue it is/ If to know that/ye do desyer Here in me ye shall it not mysse. Awaye with your Communion And with all your Englishe seruice/ Come to masse with good deuocion For that will bryng you to heauens blisse. In that ye shall se your maker Whiche made bothe heauen and earthe so rounde/ Come therfore with all humble manner That good Catholyks ye maye be founde. This is condemnacion/that light is come into the worlde/and menne haue loued darkenes more then lighte. Ioan. 3. The resurreccion of the Masse.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Masse speaketh. Resurrexi &amp; adhuc sum recum May I now sing maugre myne enemies/ For to England agayn am I now come After a moste goodly and princely wise. Oh/as one all dead &amp; longe hydde in graue And as one bayred from all honest company/ Yea/as a capon longe pent vp in the caue Exiled haue I bene miserably. From Rome I came/I can it not denye A citie in tymes paste moste florishyng/ Of the famous Goddes Idolatrie Had I without fayle my fyrst beginning. Popes manny were my fathers/as stories tell Eyghte hundred yeares they were in begetting me/ My mother thoughte my a doughter full fell Seyng in so long tyme/she coulde not be free. My mother Idolatrie was common To many a Pope in the meane whyle/ Yet trustye and true to that shauen nation Was she alwayes/and neuer them begyle. And although so many holy fathers Had to do with her at their pleasure/ yet be ye certayne that of none others Was she knowen/so faythfull dyd she endure. As the holynes is incomparable Of all my fathers at euery houre/ So lykewise great and inestimable Is my mothers honestie/worshippe and honour. Thus of noble parentes was I at the laste Brought forthe as a Goddesse perfect and pure/ My vertue in all places did I forthe caste Of their saluacion making men sure. There is no disease in all the contrie Whyther it be pockes/pyles/or other sickenes/ But to heale it I haue habilitie Helping all kynde of people in their distres. Messeled swyne and mangye horses likewise Do I cure/and chickens that haue the pyppe/ A wynchester goose to heale is my gyse No kynde of disease do I ouerhyppe. If ought be loste/I am very profitable To bring it agayn to the true owner/ To gyue rayne or fayre weather/I am able Whan soeuer to me men make theyr prayer. If the housband be weary of hys wyfe Or els the wyfe weary of her housbande/ I cause the one to haue but a shorte lyfe That eche to other maye be no more bande. Agayne/if that the maydes do wante husbandes Or yong mens wyues at any season/ They nede not lope ouer many stretes or landes But haste to me with all expedicion. I gyue housbandes and wyues at my pleasure to all people except my smered shauelynges/ Them by no meanes to marrye/can I endure But to runne a whoring aboue al thinges. They maye lyue/Sinon caste, tamen caure Lyke great common Bulles in euery toune/ From marriage therfore/I will haue them fre That their holy order maye not come doune. Nothing defyleth me/but honest marryage Whordome and adultery/I can right well abyde/ I will therfore that my massers of euery age Do fle from matrimony at euery tyde. My shorelynges to Rune/at large I thinke best And theyr chyldren to sit by other mens fyre/ For so shall they alwayes fynde moste rest And be moste mete to serue my desyre. Moreouer/to bolde baudes &amp; lusty lawyers To rufflyng ruffyns and drousye dronckardes/ To Matthew makeshifte/and suche others As depely loue/bothe dyce and cardes. To Perinrers/theues and murtherars To stincking Sodomites and adulterers/ To pollers/pyllers and vsurers Am I louing/kynde and gentle euers. I refuse (so gentle am I) no kynde of people Be they neuer so wicked and vngodly/ Chiefly/if they will come to the signe of the steple And lyke ghostly chyldren heare masse deuoutly. The worse for God/the better for me I am as common as the Barbours chayre. The trompet and I are lyke in eche degre The best of vs/bothe can not lightly appayre. Come to me who lyste/and they shalbe sure To haue good successe in all their doynge/ For my vertue is great/if it maye endure And farre surmounteth all earthely thing. Thus ye se of what great excellencye I am in euery kynde of matter/ There is no disease or maladye But I haue a salue for it euer. And as I am for diseases profitable And for all other thinges of the bodye/ So to helpe all kynde of people I am able If to come to me/they will themselfes applye. Golde/syluer/rychesse/glorie and honoure Fame/renoune/and worldly felicite/ House/lande/lordshippe/village/towne &amp; bowre Do I gyue to all them/that come vnto me. Whatsoeuer in this worlde is contayned Is myne to geue at myne owne pleasure/ Fall doune and worshippe me with hartes vnfayned And ye shall wante no worldly treasure. Therfore my Chaplens and seruauntes dere If these giftes ye will enioye at my hande/ Looke that ye euery daye masse do here For it is good/I will you to vnderstande. Se that ye ryse betimes in the morninge With an harte desyrous to honour me/ And assone as the Sexten do the the bell rynge Looke that in the church streyghtwayes ye be. Take holy water/&amp; crosse your self in the forehead Make curtesy mannerly/and knele doune deuoutly/ Drawe as nye to the aultare as can be deuised And in all poyntes behaue your self solemnely. Gyue good eare to that my chapleyn dothe saye Although ye vnderstand nothing at all/ Shake your head/and lyft vp your handes alwaye And fetche syghes also bothe great and small. Be euer prayeng of your Aue Mary For that is a prayer full gracious/ Looke that at the Gospell ye stande vp manerly And make curtesye at the name of Iesus. The Gospell ended/knele doune agayne As wyse as ye were before ye stoode vp. For to stande longe it were to muche payne Chiefly if it were late/whan ye did suppe. But whan my Chaplein come to the heauing Of that litle great God aboue hys head/ Looke that then mekely ye fall to crouching Liftinge vp your handes with harte vnfayned. Crye out O my Lorde and my Sauiour In the alone is all my confidence/ I will magnifye the at euery houre For thou arte a God of moste excellence. Looke that ye honour this God aboue all thinge Whiche is halden vp betwene the priestes hand/ For he is a God of Pope Innocentes makynge The thirde of that name/I do you to vnderstand. Pope Nicolas also and pope Urban Dyd muche helpe to the perfection of it/ So did fryer Thomas that pratye man And many other mo/as it is fyt. Thynke that these wordes, Hoc est corpus meum Be of so great strength/vertue and power/ That they are able to make Gods awne sonne To come from heauen in the minute of an houre. And although ye bothe se/fele and taste bred Yet muste ye nedes beleue the contrarie For holy Churche hath full determined That it is Christes naturall bodye. And though it be worme eaten/furyed or moulde And so styncke/that noman can it abyde/ Yet oure mother holy churche woulde Ye should beleue it God bothe backe and syde. And although it be agaynst the nature Of the Sacrament to be Christes naturall body/ Yet muste ye beleue it bothe stedfaste and sure According to pope Innocentes decree. And albeit Christe and holy writte do saye That Christes reall bodye is in heauen onely/ Yet se that ye be stoute/and saye alwaye That in the Sacrament it is really. And albeit it fighteth with the verite Of Christes bodye reall and naturall/ In many places at one tyme to be Yet the contrary beleue you shall. And although Christ and his Apostles all With the olde Doctors and reason dothe perswade/ That it is not Christes bodye naturall Yet saye ye/it is very God that all made. And steke you strongly to the determinacion Of oure mother holy Churche Catholycke/ And if any be of contrary opinion Burne hym out of hande lyke an heretycke. Se that ye continew alwaye in this fayth That the Sacramente is Christes naturall bodye/ Flesh/bloud and bone/as pope Nicolas sayeth And in this fayth remayne tyll ye dye. And what if you for thus beleuing Go to the Deuyll my great gr?dde father/ Feare ye not/my Chaplens for you shall syng And neuer leaue tyll they you deliuer. For I am so mightye that I am able Euen damned soules to dispatche out of hell/ Traianus storye prouyth this veritable Whiche by me was releued/as they do tell. Therfore ye my dere &amp; louing massehunters Whan soeuer my chaplens holy and deuoute/ Heaue vp that title great God se that ye euers Fall to knocking and kneling rounde aboute. Agayne/whan the chalice/bleste mought it be Is holden vp aboue the priestes head/ Lyfte vp your handes and eyes/that all maye se Ye be deuout people and wel disposed. In the holy chalice ye shall vnderstond Is Christes very true and naturall bloode/ Therfore to honour that also are ye bond For the holy Popes haue so thought it goode. After that ye haue sene that godly syghte Fall to prayer agayn deuoutly/ Serue some good saincte with all your mighte Eyther with a Pater noster or Aue Mary. But heare ye? when the second sacrye comes And your yonge God is d?dled about the chalice/ Looke that then ye starte vp with good deuocion And to honour your God moste humbly deuyce. Looke vpon that new founde God earnestly Worshippe hym/honour him/and reuer?ce hym to/ Beleue hym to be your Sauiour onely Your redemer and mediatour also. Agayne/whan the Pare is caryed about/ Se that ye kysse it with all humilite/ All the masse tyme looke ye appere deuoute That ye maye seme good Catholykes to be. When the priest comes to s. Ihons Gospel And blesseth him as he were wood/ Do ye so likewise/for I plainly you tell Agaynst wicked sprites it is very good. When the prieste hath once sayde, Deo gracias And kyste the aultare in stead of a woman/ Than maye ye well know/that done is the masse And home maye ye go/as wyse as ye came. But before out of the Church ye departe Looke ye take holy water foole deuoutly/ Sprynckle your self with that from the very harte And make a crosse in your forehead solemly. All these thinges once done with good deuocion Ye maye do that ye will all the daye after For ye haue offered to God suche an oblacion That ye can not anger him in any matter. Now maye ye fall to bollyng and bibbing To dysing/to carding and to whorehunting/ To polling/to pilling/and to fals brybing To quarelling/to fighting/to scolding and chydinge. What ye liste/that do/and be not afrayde For amendes is made by hearing of masse All thinges aforehande be all redy payde Feare not/for I haue set you in a good case. Let this than be your dayly exercise Fyrst in the morning to heare masse deuoutly/ And afterward whatsoeuer ye practise It shall come to passe/I warrant you/luckely. My power is wonderfull/my vertue is great My dignite passeth all thinges mortall/ In me/in me alone is all goodnes set Therfore now vnto me let all men fall. Thus haue I declared to you partly What profytes ye massehunters get by me/ But know ye/that not for the body onely But for the soule also I serue in eche degre. The soules that lye burning in Purgatory Miserably puling for wante of soccure/ By me they are redemed spedely And brought out of their payne in half an houre. The masse of Requiem is of great strengthe When for a soule it is eyther songe or sayde/ It alwayes helpeth without fayle at lengthe Though the soule with synne/be neuer so decayde. A trentall of masses is very profitable For a soule departed at euery season/ For that vnto glory without any fable Wil bring the soule with all expedicion. But not for purgatory soules onely Am I profitable and stond in stead/ The soules also/whiche in hell fyre do lye Are ofte by me from their paynes redemed. Unto the very helles dothe my vertue pearce When for any soule I am songe or sayde/ Sathan that tyraunte/bothe cruell and fearce Is of me and my power greatly afrayde. My noble presence maketh the deuell to rore And all the flames of hell shortly to quenche/ My royall presence causeth euermore All the infernall paynes quickely to stenche. Yea/from the dongeon of hell to heauen so hye Do I cause the damned soules for to ascend/ To me/to me therfore let all men applye If to come to glory they do intend. By me the soules of sainctes in heauen also Are lauded/praysed and magnifyde/ As the masse of Gaudeamus omnes in domino Dothe righte well declare at euery tyde. God and oure Ladye with the good sainctes all Apostles/martyrs/confessors and virgines/ With all the holy Aungels seraphicall By me do reioyce/as moste louing twynes. Thus ye se in Purgatory/heauen and hell I raygne as a moste tryumph?t Empresse/ So that to them/that in those places do dwell My vertue dothe extend bothe more and les. What shall I speake of my beneficence Toward the soules of them that be mortall/ To saue their soules/I am of great excellence When soeuer on me they earnestly call. My Chaplens/thorow me offer dayly For all such as with mony do them hyre/ An holy sacrifice propiciatory And so deliuer their soules out of the myre. The synnes of the whole worlde/thorow me Are clerely remitted and put awaye/ My mighty power is to make them all fre Which for remission of synnes/mony do paye. Whatsoeuer synne is committed Be it pryde/whordome/thefte or blasphemy/ By me it is vtterly dispatched And the synners made bothe pure and holy. For clensyng of the soule/no man dothe nede To seke after any other Phisicion/ He that liste vnto me/for to make spede Shall haue of me a sufficient purgacion. As men dayly do greuously offend So muste they haue a dayly sacrifice/ To be rydde of your synnes/if ye entend To haste vnto me/ye muste nedes deuice. For in me/my marked marchauntes eche one Offer vp Christ the sonne of God dayly/ They crucifye hym agayne/though he be gone And offer a sacrifice Propiciatory. And the sacrifice that they do offer Is of so greate efficacie/mighte and poure As that whiche Christ offered to hys father Whan he hanged on the Crosse at the laste houre. By Christes death/the synne originall Was onely put awaye/as many holde But I dispatche all synnes vniuersall As witnesse my Chaplens/bothe stoute and bolde. Folish are they therfore/that take thought for syn As though it were a burden intollerable/ Seyng for a litle money they maye wynne Forgyuenes of synnes/and become vnculpable. When the masse begynes/they maye be synnefull But before the masse be perfectly ended/ My smered Chaplens/all synne fr? them shall pul And make them to be thorowly saued. For the blessed masse is not so sone sayde Of the massinge Chaplens at the altare/ But all the debtes for synnes are wholy payde And they brought agayne to Gods fauer. Thus in heauen/earthe/hell and Purgatory I raygne as a moste triumphant Goddesse/ All thinges are blessed by me/and made wealthy Deliuered from sorowe and all distresse. Agayne/what a number of idle bellyde priestes Besydes monkes/heremites/Chanons and fryers/ Do I fede/to be makers of Christes Whiche otherwise shoulde fall into the bryers. I make them to be hadde in reputacion I make them to sitte hyest at the table. I make them to be called Syrs/euery one I make them worshipfull and honorable. I make them in their apparell to be Galaunte and pleasaunte in euery mans syghte I make them greatest in euery degre I make them makers of God almighty. I make them to walke in goodly longe gounes With typpeties of sarcenet about their neckes/ I make them to weare forked cappes on their shau? crounes I make th? to do what they list without checkes. I make them of the labour of other mens h?des. To liue idely lyke men of great substaunce/ I enryche them with gaye houses and landes I make them to lyue all in pleasaunce. I make them in loue with other mens wyues I make their chyldren to syt by other mens fyres/ I make them to lede pleasaunte &amp; wealthy lyues Euen according to their hartye desyres. I make them searchers of all mens secretes Thorow holy auriculare confession/ I make them to playe many praty feates And yet fewe spye their abhominacion. By me alone they mayntayne their whoring Their horses/their hauckes/their hondes &amp; their sp?nels/ By me alone haue they their pleasa?t liuing Running here and there/or where they list els. I make the order of priesthoode honorable I onely/am the sraye of all massemongers/ It is I that make the massepriestes able To matche with the best/and to be called masters. If I were not/thei should haue many euel happes If I were not/their gouns should sone be threde bare If I were not/their hayre should grow thorow their cappes If I were not/they should haue bothe carcke &amp; care. I wolde therfore that no man should maruel Though massingpriestes do stoutly holde with me/ For they are certen/and do know right well That the best floure of their garlande I must be. Therefore whan ye heare th? loude lye at Paules crosse As many in their serm?s haue done of late/ Blame them not/for they haue had a longlosse Therfore it is now hye tyme for them to prate. Masses/Purgatory and prayeng for the dead Are the chief pyllers of their popish kyngdome/ If these thre thinges were once abrogated Then come they streyghtwayes vnto confusion. I wolde therfore/that my chaplens shoulde prate harde For these thre thinges aboue all other/ Or els their kyngdome shall neuer go forewarde By swete sainct Mary/Christes owne mother. For holy auriculare confession I wolde haue them also prate harde/harde/harde/ For if they haue not that popish inuencion Their market will be altogether marde. By that they shall know all mens secrety By that/they shall syt as Goddes in mens consci?ce/ By that they shall bring the people wonderfully Into all submission and obedience. By that they shall make Lordes to th? for to loute Ladys and gentlemen shall they bring vnder/ By that as Gods they shall raygne rounde aboute And know where stuffe is against the next yeare. Thus haue I tolde you parte of my vertues And what I am able to do in euery place/ I suppose ye thincke them very straunge newes Yet shall ye fynde them trew by oure Lady of grace. My massing chaplens and the massehunters Know these thinges too be trew that I haue spoken/ Their diligent c?ming to the masse euers Is hereof a very manifest token. Oh/somtime here in England gloriously I raygned as a Goddesse supernal/ Tyll Gods worde/in the time of kyng Henry Began to be knowne in places ouer all. Thorow the scripture and other treatises With the sermons of diuers learned menne/ To be espied began my fantasies So that many to me did not greatly leane. Yet thorow the stoutenes of some prelates Which euer loued me for my fathers sake/ I styl continued among my pyldepates And the moste parte of men did me wel take. Notwithstanding/my people religious As monkes/chanons/heremites/nonnes and fryers/ Began among the people to be odious And were called hypocrites and lyers. Their hypocrisye and fayned holynes Came to lighte euery daye more and more/ Their vnchaste chastitie also certes Made all good people them to abhorre. Their abhominable lyfe was so manifest Besydes all their wicked Idolatrie/ That all godly men together thought it best All their houses to suppresse vtterly. Suppreste they were vnto my great discomforte And bothe I and they at the doores thruste out/ Few had we then/that wolde vs supporte So were we compelled to range about. Yet in paryshes and churches cathedral In colleges also was I styl mayntayned/ There I founde fauour/whatsoeuer dyd befal And among them was I greatly commended. Yet was my courage wonderfully slayne To se me out of the monasteries exiled/ For I thoughte alwayes/I shoulde haue bene fayne Out of this realme shortly to haue fled. For many began my iugling to perceaue And what an enemy I was to Christes bloude/ They sayde/I should no lenger them deceaue Therfore to banishe me/they thought it good. And without doubte so had it come to passe If the stoute prelates had not styked hard to me/ But they humbly kneled before the kynges grace And sayde/it were petie/it shoulde so be. Many reasons out of duns and dorbel They brought forthe in the parliament hous/ But out of Gods worde neuer a deal No/not so muche as was worthe a pylde lous. Yet their reasons went for payment am?ge them And I founde by acte of parliament/ To be necessary ad salutem For the quicke and dead/a godly entent. At the making of the .vi. articles done was this A right good parliam?t for my shauelinges/ If that might remayne/we should neuer do amys But euermore rule lyke Lordes in all thinges. Now was it made bothe burning and hanging To speake agaynst me or that litle great God/ No better coulde I haue had it by wishing Than for these new fellowes to haue such a rodde. Now thought I my self in a goodly case And so sure/that I should neuer decaye/ Euery man called me the moste blessed masse And wayted on me lyke a Goddesse alwaye. I raygned/I ruled/I was in my ruffe I was songe/I was sayde in euery coste/ Man/wyfe &amp; chylde called me pure good stuffe And magnifyed me to the vttermoste. Well was I tyll certayne of the new learninge Began to sturte vp after their olde fashion/ Agaynst me and the litle great God speaking Calling vs bothe horrible abhominacion. Then began my buttocks for feare to quake I thoughte my destruccion to be at hande/ But the prelates did the matter vp take And those heretykes stoutely withstande. For shortly they burnt them/as their wonte is So vehement and whote is their charitie/ Thinking by this means to do hye seruice Unto Gods moste excellent maiestie. Somewhat chered agayn after that I was And rayned lyke a Goddesse moste nobly/ Yea/I was in a wonderfull good case Tyll the death of that mighty kynge Henry. After hys death I began to waxe faynte For I that before was taken for a goddesse/ Coulde not now be admitted for a saincte An Idoll to call me/they did not ceasse. A sacrifice propiciatory Was I afore/bothe for the quicke and dead/ Yea/and that no salutem necessary By acte of parliament adiudged. Now am I proued no sacrifice at all But a playne enemy to Christus passion/ A Maumet and Idol they do me call Worthy to be brought vnto vtter confusion. In the beginning of kynge Edwardes raygne They called me first to examination/ My self I did so slenderly mayntayne That all men might se my weake foundacion. For of Gods worde I haue no grounde at all That playnly dothe condemne me the trueth to tell/ At Rome had I my first originall Of a number of Popes/as it befell. Clouted and patched lyke a beggers cloke Was I/God knoweth/foule euell fauoredly/ Ragges they brought out of their popish poke And cobled them on me after their fansy. What myne owne name meane/I can not declare No/the papistes themselfs can it not define/ Although herein they haue taken full great care And wolde very gladly the trueth out fyne. This worde missa hath bene diligently soughte And yet can they not fynde/wherof it come/ They studie about a matter of nought? This am I certen/that I came from Rome. Fyrst whan I was at the barre arraygned A certayne simple mayde/called the communion/ Before all the company/me greuously accused And layde to my charge muche abhominacion. She called me a thefe and a God robber An harlot and a spirituall whore/ Sayeng that I and my massers together Had vtterly dryuen Christ out at the doore. Ye take vpon you/quod she/to offer sacrifice For the synnes/bothe of the quicke and the dead/ Whiche onely pertayneth to Christes office As by the scriptures it is clerely proued. Ye corrupte the wordes of the Lordes supper And adde of your owne imaginacion/ Ye reherse them also in hocker mocker That the people haue no edificacion. Ye set vp a straunge God to be worshipped Made of bread/lyke vnto a waffer cake/ Of wicked pope Urban/this haue ye learned And thus the true liuing God do ye forsake. The Sacrament of Christes body and bloud By you Antichristes is defyled vtterly/ Marchandyse ye make of it/as ye were woode And dayly to your chapmen ye sell it for monye/ The congregacion/by Christes appoyntement In perfecte loue should receaue it together/ But to eate it alone is your entent Standing lyke fylthye swyne at the aulter. To the good playne people ye turne your backes And playe many a pratye iugling caste/ Brandon the iuglare had neuer goodlyer knackes Than ye haue at your masse/bothe fyrste and laste. At your masse ye mock/ye mow/ye breath/ye blow At your masse ye kysse/ye lycke/ye knele/ye knocke/ At your masse about the chalice your God ye throw And dandle hym vp &amp; doune lyken Robyn Rodocke. At your masse/lyke charmers and coniurers Ye make your crosses for feare of sprites/ At your masse ye blesse oft with your greasy fyngers I thincke it be for auoyding euel syghtes. At your masse ye stand nodding in your mem?to Lyke Bedlem iackes/cleane out of your wyttes/ At your masse lyke shackled geese ye hoppe to &amp; fro Now standing/now kneling/as it come by fyttes. At your masse lyke chuffes ye eate &amp; drincke alone Cleane contrary to Christes institucion/ The people looke vpon you/but they kan get none Whiche doubtles/is a great abhominacion. At your masse/ye suppe and suppe/&amp; styl ye suppe Tyll that ye leaue nothing at all behynde/ Than blesse ye the people with an emptye cuppe And sende them home/bothe ignorant and blynde. At your masse/God is openly blasphemed At your masse/Christes bloud is dishonored/ At your masse/all Idolatrie is committed At your masse/the Lordes supper is defyled. At your masse/the simple people are blynded At your masse/many blasphemies are done/ At your masse/all good men with sorowe are fylled At your masse/the deuels in hell haue delectation. All good men vtterly abhorre the masse All good men will not be present at it/ All good men crye out vpon her and alas All good men wishe her hence for to flit. Where the masse is/there is no true religion For it is the headspring of all Idolatrie/ Where the masse is/there is all supersticion Wickednes and abhominable hypocrisy. None is to be founde so common an whore So notable an harlot/so stoute a strompet/ As the masse is/though she go from doore to doore With thous?des in one day to medle/she wil not let. Who therfore wayeng these abhominacions Will not consent to b?nish the masse/ Seyng she is so full of supersticions And set Gods people in so damnable a case. If ye loue God/his worde and Sacrament Bannishe this whore away from among you/ Let her no lenger be here permanent Leste worser plagues do here after ensew. Bannishe her/and awaye with her aulters Doune with the pyxs that hange so hye/ Your copes and vestimentes with all suche matters Awaye with them as thinges of vilanye. After she had on this wyse tolde her tale To bannishe me all with one voyce did consent/ I spake/but nothing coulde I preuayle To conclude/vnto Rome streighwayes I went. Pope Paule welcomed me very hartely So did the Bishoppes and Cardinalles eche one/ To whome/whan I had tolde my matter playnly Aue Maria/they made wonderfull mone. Full suerely they culled and kyssed me And badde me be on a good conforte/ Though the whole worlde/doughter do forsake the Yet will we/sayde they/styll the supporte. Their wordes/I tell you/warned me at the harte As though it had bene gynger of the best/ I was glad/those fathers did not from me starte For with them yet I thoughte/I shoulde haue rest. After this came monckes/chanons and fryers Nonnes/heremites/anckers and anckresses/ All these welcomed me with goodly attyers And made of me euen as if a goddesse. Moreouer/bolde baudes and lusty lawers Ruffling ruffyns/and drousye dronkardes/ Pollers/pyllers/theues/and murthers With all suche as loue bothe dyce and cardes. Periurers/vsurers/brybe takers also Papistes/sodomytes/hypocrites likewyse/ With all the rable of noughtye packes to and fro All these swarmed aboute me after their olde gyse. They welcomed and welcomed me agayne Ioyfull they were to beholde my visage/ Many of them sayde/I had taken great payne Seyng I had come so long a viage. In Rome I tarryed a certayne space To se what fauour the people bare to me/ With the godly wyse I had but litle grace They iudged me a very Idol to be. I heare also/that in Fraunce and Italy Suche as to the studies Theological/ Do their myndes vnfaynedly applye Set by me and my chaplens nothing at all. In Polelande also/Portingale and Spayne. In Flaunders/Scotland and in many realmes mo/ I am lyke shortly to haue but litle gayne For many of them begynne from me to go. What shal I speake of Denmarke &amp; Germany With many noble contryes and cities besyde/ They all haue forsaken me vtterly And are gone from me/bothe farre and wyde. They that the Gospel truly vnderstand And by the lighte therof espye my iugling/ Will no lenger vnto me be bonde But fle from me/as from a pestilent thing. So that besydes myne olde customers Whiche to you heretofore I rehersed/ I haue neither frendes nor yet louers That fauoure me with hartes vnfayned. And yet as I heare/some of my olde acquaynta?ce Begynne to fall from me dayly more and more/ Which is to me certes a great greuaunce And will hereafter proue to a foule sore. The ende I aforesee euidently I shal surely be bannished at the laste/ For many do now my iugling espye So that oute at the doores I must be caste. Euery plante that my heauenly father Hath not planted/sayeth Christ in the Gospel/ Shal be plucked vp by the rootes for euer Though the worlde be neuer so woode and fel. Of God am not I planted without doubte A doughter I am of the Popes begetting/ Therefore muste I also be rooted out Whan the tyme dothe come of Gods appoyntinge. Euen as other fantasies of men are gone So must I folow/will I/nyll I/ We shal all trudge by one and by one That God alone maye haue all the glory. We maye thorow the helpe of hypocrites Florish dayly/and prosper for a whyle/ But yet shortly shall we not be worthe .iij. mytes Be iudged of the people in euery yle. Remembringe these thinges/it maketh me agaste And so dothe it all my smered shorelinges/ No maruayle/for then is all our glory paste And we maye walke lyke a sorte of staruelinges. Thus was I in a great perplexitie Although at Rome among my holy fathers/ Fearing alwaye some greate calamitie To chaunce vnto me and to my maskers. Yet how frendly the deuel was to me/marcke Beyng in great trouble/not knowing where to st?de One came poste haste to me/and sayd harcke/harcke O good newes/good newes out of Englande. I stode styl/what is the matter quod I? Edward the syxte/kyng of England is dead/ Whiche bannished wicked Idolatrye And all popishe abhominacion suppressed. Beyng astonied with these sodayne newes I asked of hym/if these tydinges were true/ Yea/that they are/quod he/by the kyng of Iewes And that shall the Gospelers shortly rue. A sorte of the preachers are caste in pryson Some in the towre/and some in the marshalseas/ Some in the flete/and some in the dongeon But from preaching/all sorte of them do ceas. None preach nowe but papistes with their shauen crounes They beare the route in euery pulpet/ They trudge vp and doune in their longe gounes And making merry/in euery tauern they syt. And whereof do they prate/preache I wolde saye Not of Christ nor of his holy Gospel/ But of the litle great God they prate alwaye Which among them/chiefly beareth the bel. The Sacrament of the aultare/sayeth eche one After the wordes of consecracion/ Is Christes owne body/flesh/bloud and bone But how? ye maye not aske suche a question. It is ynough that the churche catholike Hath so determined the matter/ Who sayeth the contrary is an heretyke And remediles must be brent with fyer. They talke also of pickepurse purgatory Declaring what a terrible place it is/ And haue all mens soules muste therein frye Before they can come to heauenly blysse. The hypocrites agayne stoutely do prate Of prayeng to sainctes in oure aduersite/ As though Christ were not an able aduocate To helpe as in all oure miserie. Of images to be laye mens kalenders They babble very ofte in their sermons/ Wysshing them to be set vp as teachers In all temples and congregacions. Agaynste the marriage of priestes they prate harde But cleane without the holy scripture/ They wolde gladly haue that go backwarde That in their whordome they might styl endure. For holy auriculare confession They all take on/as though they were wood/ In muste this come with all expedicion Or els/saye they/we shal neuer do good. What shal I holde you/sayd the tidinges bringer With many wordes or with a longe tale/ There was no kynde of papistrie euer But in England it is lyke to haue good sale. Therfore Lady masse/if ye will do wel Make haste into England with all spede/ Frendes shall ye haue plentye/I you tel Whiche wil stande by you in all your nede. Ye shall haue redy against your comming Aulters bylte vp in moste goodly wyse/ And your priestes redy to fal a iugling After their olde and accustomed gyse. For longe before my comming awaye Masons were sent for in euery place/ Lyme/sande/morter/stone and claye Were fetched into the churches apace. Aultare clothes/corporasses and cruettes Copes/vestementes/albes/boke/bell and chalice/ Candelstickes/paxe/and suche other trynckettes Be in a redines after the best wyse. Therfore haste/poste haste/and haste for your lyfe Neuer stynte/tyl that England ye se/ The papistes shal ye there fynde very ryfe Whiche wil receaue you with sporte and gle. To the holy father I hasted a pace To take my leaue of hym with all humilite/ Whome I founde in a very homely place As me thoughte/not semely for hys degre. I perceaue wel/all is not golde that shyne Many speake agaynst priestes matrimonie/ Whiche do them selfs to muche leudned encline Lyke stincking Sodomites moste fylthie. But let this thing passe/I boldely stepte in As a doughter/worthy suche a father/ To declare the matter/I did begynne After a moste humble and obedient manner. My tale tolde/he greatly reioyced As one that had muche noble treasure founde/ Once agayne to hys playe fellow he turned And sayde/all oure thinges will be wel and sounde. Is Englande come to this case? to this case? Whiche heretofore did vs so greatly despyse? What/will she haue agayn our doughter masse? Salue sesta dies/I like wel this gyse. My Indulgenses and pardons shortlye Will take place/I truste/with toties quoties, My bulles/my waxe/my leade and suche pelfrye To bringe vs home monye/shal not now cease. If I mighte once agayne be admitted Supreme head of the churche of Englande/ Will they/nyll they/by me they shoulde be ruled I wolde make them peasauntes/and vnto me b?de. Well doughter/make haste/and to England go Commend me to my frendes/both louing and dere/ Applye your matters bothe to and fro That shortly good newes I maye from you here. Thus I departed from his holynes And wente to other of myne acquaintaunce/ Whome my newse did so wonderfully please That it fylled their hartes with ioye and pleasa?ce. Biddinge them farewel/to Englande I hasted Oh/what oratoure is able to expres/ Howe ioyfull I was here receaued Welcome/welcome/they cried with greate gladnes. Bishoppes/priestes and quondam religious I meane monkes/nonnes/chanons and fryers/ With all other people supersticious Were as gladde as byrdes vpon bryers. All papistes and all hypocrites agayne And all godles people made wonderful sporte/ Of my returne/they were maruelously fayne Sayeng: my sight did them greatly conforte. There was tossing of pottes/&amp; mak?g good chere Dauncing and leaping for the best game/ Drouncelettes were hearde bothe farre and nere And many partes playde cleane out of frame. Masse is come/masse is come/they openly cryde Of soules and bodies the alone sauioure/ Let vs now reioyce on euery syde And the holy masse/bothe worshippe and honoure. Thus of my comming/all degrees were gladde I meane all those that loue the pope of Rome/ Onely the Gospellers semed to be sadde And lyke people that were vtterly vndone. Streyghtways was I had to this &amp; that aultare Where I was honorably entreated/ All papistes came to me bothe nere and farre But the trew Christians me vtterly abhorred. They can not abyde the sighte of me But call me fylthie Idol and Maumette/ From me/as from the pestilence they fle And as many as they can also let. But as for my olde former acquayntaunce They be all myne bothe whole and sounde/ If they maye do oughte/I haue good affiaunce That I shal neuer fal vnto the grounde. Thus I that in sighte lately was dead Am rysen agayn moste triumphantly/ Christes communion is now exiled And I in place set as a goddesse moste hye. My priestes that before with hayre were ouergrowen Are now both smoth &amp; smircking shorelinges/ Their gotishe beardes be now awaye throwen And their Catlike crounes trimed with shaueu?ges Their pylde and threde bare gounes are away cast Their greasy forked cappes are layde asyde/ To se them so gaye/men are greatly agaste In all places now they so pleasantly glyde. Mony in their purses they haue plentye To maske/to masse they are so desyred/ The Catholickes for masses styll do crye By this means/my priestes are greatly enryched. As for the godly ministers certen They are trounsed in euery place/ Specially/if they be married men Suche fynde but litle mercy and grace. Fylthie whoring dothe the papistes wel please Holy matrimony they can not abyde/ To be marryed/they thincke it a disease Not semely for priestes at any tyde I doubt not/but my praters at Paules crosse And other champions takinge their parte/ Will so from poste to pillare them tosse That they shal haue litle ease at their harte. I truste we shal so handle the matter That priestes from their wyues shal be separate/ We also wil them so spoyle and begger That we shal bringe them to a poore state. Honest matrimony I can not abide Massinge/and that can not agre together/ Married priestes shal put their wiues asyde Or els be handled after an homely manner. All preachers and fauourers of the Gospel We wil surely bring as lowe as we maie/ But all suche maskers as masses do sell We wil promote and make them gaye. I and my champions shall beare all the route The protestantes maye go pycke a sallet/ We papistes shal rule the roste rounde aboute And no man so hardye agaynst vs for to set. Thus shal I rule as a moste noble goddesse Me shall all people bothe worshippe and honoure/ To extolle me my papistes shall not cease Speaking good of me at euery houre. But of one thing I must here geue warning To all my louers/bothe faithful and dere/ That they be diligent in this one thinge To darcken the Gospel/that it shyne not clere. In stead of Christes Euangely Preache the real presence and transsubstantiacion/ Talke of pylgrimages and purgatory Of images and sainctes intercession. Preache iustificacion of workes and fre wil Preache auriculare confession likewise/ Preache that Gods lawe we are able to fulfyl Preache the masses/propiciatory sacrifice. Preache ceremonies/holy bread and holy water Holy waxe/holy flaxe/and holy reliques/ Holy oyle/holy creame/and holy asches euer Holy candels/holy fyre/and holy salow stickes. Preache againste/at the least corrupte alwaye Whatsoeuer is founde in the scripture/ That dothe the popish lawe against saye Though it be neuer so good/trew and pure. Againste the alone iustification of fayth Preache stoutely/and put wil workes thereunto/ Or els whatsoeuer the scripture sayeth Tel them/vnto heauen they can not go. To Christes bloude ioyne the popes purgatory Tell them/that after this lyfe they must also/ Be purged therein from all their vilany Or els vnto heauen/blysse can they not go. And here exhorte all men of eche degre To praye deuoutly for the soules departed/ With solemne Placebo and Dirige And a masse of Requiem thereunto added. Tell them it is very meritorious And a good dede/so for the soules to praye/ Masses and Diriges make them ful ioyous And cause their paynes greatly to decaye. Tell them that Christe is not so oure mediatoure But we haue nede of some good saincte also/ To be vnto God oure intercessoure Or els vnto heauens blysse can we not go. Tell them/that auriculare confession Deuised by pope Innocent the thirde/ Is so necessary vnto saluacion That without it/sinnes can not be remitted. Tell th?/that priestes haue power to forgyue syn Whan so euer they saye, Ego absoluo te,/ Therfore/their synnes to confesse let them begyn And from all their synnes/they shal sone be fre. Tell them/that the gylding of images And paynting of tabernacles also/ Hath bene greatly praysed in all ages And openeth a waye vnto heauen for to go. Tell them/that pylgrimage goyng likewise Is very profitable for the soule/ Exhorte them to bring in agayne that gyse And to drincke of s. Edmundes pardon boulle. Tell them/that to be burried in s. Fraunces coule Is very good for the soules saluacion/ Though it be neuer so lousy or foule As in their holy rule is made mencion. Tell them/that workes done of a good intent Auayleth no les vnto saluacion/ Then thinges appointed by Gods commaundem?t To be done of the Christen congregracion. Tell them/whatsoeuer holy churche bidde Though to the scripture it be clene contrary/ That of all men muste be fulfilled And neuer aske any question why. Tell them/they muste it thincke it sufficient That holy churche hath so ordayned/ And though it be not Gods commaundement Yet tel them/it muste nedes be obeyed. As the Idolatrous priestes in tymes paste Cried/the temple of the Lord/the temple of the Lord/ So to crye/ let it euer be your caste The holy churche/the holy church with one accord. Deface the doctrine of the fore preachers So muche as ye can/to the vttermoste/ By calling them coblers/tynckers and taylers And vnlearned asses in euery coste. But looke ye call your selfs master doctor And Graduate of the vniuersite/ Preache in your hoode/and set forthe your honor And so declare what learned men ye be. As for Dorbel/Duns/Thomas and Tartar Gabriel/Lombarde/master of the sentence/ Gorram/Alberte/and other of that secte Saye/ye haue sene them though many yeares h?ce. Tell them/that the doctrine which ye teach nowe Is catholycke/olde and olde agayne/ Holy churche did it alwayes allowe And in their counsails euer it mayntayne. Agayn I wolde haue you lyke stoute Nemroth Cryeout at Paules crosse againste the Printers/ Saye/ that they are the cause/that the worlde goeth So euel with our mother holy churche euers. Say/with their bokes they marre al the market And fyll the whole realme with heresye/ For to rede those bokes/all the worlde is set And to holy churche wil not them selfs applye. Saye/that all the bokes that haue bene printed Here in England/by the space of syxe yeare/ Are all with great heresyes infected And wel worthie to be set on a fyre. The Catechismes/and the boke of comm? prayer The Homilies and Articles also/ With al other bokes intreating of the scripture Are worthie into the fyre for to go. Crieout/that all suche bokes maye be condemned Eyther by an acte of parliam?t/ Or elles by proclamacion incalled And so afterwarde to be shortly brent. This thing shal auaunce my kingdome greatly And set bothe you and me in a goodly staye/ Therefore I wolde haue you the matter to applye That it mighte be dispatched out of the waye. Furthermore/if there do any arise Speakinge againste me and my kyngedome To laye hande on hym streightwayes deuise And cruelly caste him into prysonne. Manace him with wordes/bothe fearce and fel Threaton him with faggot/fyre and halter/ And to put it in vse/ye shal do wel That other thereby maye learne to feare. I wolde not haue you dispute with the scripture But rather with halter/fyre and faggot/ For these argumentes are so stronge and sure That none of them all can vndo that knotte. By farre means agayne/se what ye can do Promise them a benefice or prebend/ Saye/ye will be their hartie frendes also If they wil become conformable and amende. Thus by foule or fayre means proue mascrise Though it be cleane against youre conscience/ And euermore/let this be youre deuise To maintayne me and my magnificence. If ye wil do after this myne aduertisement So shal bothe you and I right wel prosper/ But if ye beginne to be negligent Then shal we sone perish altogether. Therfore/if ye tender my dignite My worshippe/my honour and my excellence/ Looke that in these thinges diligent ye be So shal ye long enioy my presence. Otherwise/I shall surely be so hunted Of the protestantes my foes mortal/ That to fle agayne/I shalbe compelled As a slaue/bothe miserable and thraul. And then shal ye also come doune/doune/ And be had no more in estimacion/ Laughed to scorne shal ye be with your shau? croune And vtterly broughte vnto confusion. The cause why/I geue you suche a charge is this It was tolde me of a frende sence my comming/ That the masse should be dryu? out of Engl?d twise And the second tyme shalbe past all helpinge. The masse at the firste tyme shal recouer Her bannishment righte well/quod that my frende/ But the seconde time shalbe for euer For bannished shal she be vnto the ende. Agayne/ye knowe Christes prophecye Euery plante that God hath not planted/ Shalbe plucked vp by the rootes vtterly And be caste awaye/as a thing fayned. Of God certes haue not I my foundacion But of a sorte of popes patched together/ Therfore muste I nedes come vnto confusion Because my foundacion is so slender. I knowe also/there are a greate number Whiche come to me with very hollowe hartes/ Wishing at the deuel/dothe me and my masser For playeng suche popishe and iugling partes. Suche I tell you/are not to be trusted Although outwardely they beare a fayre face/ They do but looke/when I shalbe confounded Then wil they crye/doune with her apace. Furthermore/it standeth you also in hande To looke vpon this matter diligently/ For I do you all to vnderstande The cause is yours also/ and not myne onely. The papistes/quod my fr?de/shal twise haue a fal In this realme of England certenly/ The fyrste right wel recouer they shal The second shalbe without remedye. They shal then of the people be so hated That none shal vouchsafe to haue th? at their bourde Yea/of them selfs they shal so be ashamed That thei shal couer their crouns with a cowtourd. And then saide he/is their vtter destruccion come For after that time shal they neuer more ryse/ But Christes gospel/euen vnto the dome Shal in this realme florishe in moste goodly wyse. Of oure fyrste fall/we haue had experience Of that we may wel iudge what shal folow. Let vs therefore take hede with all aduertence For when that come/then begynne oure sorow. Watche therefore my chaplens &amp; ch?pions stoute Take tyme/whyle the tyme haue ye maye/ Prye/spye/and diligently looke aboute For I tell you trueth/the tyme wil awaye. Remember the lessons/that I haue geuen you Profitable they are for my kyngdome/ Looke that those diligently ye ensue Than to good fortune maye we happe to come. We shal yet for a whyle triumphe and raygne We shal beare the rout/&amp; doun with the Gospellers We shal pleasantly oure estate mayntayne And of al men be counted ioly rufflers. You as gentle men shal raygne in all contrise I as a goddesse shalbe of greate renowme/ And by this means to syng I maye deuise Resurrexi &amp; adhucsum recum. Valete &amp; Plaudite. O aulas. O ollas. O missas. O nugas. O sacrifices. O carnifices. O concionatores. O cornicatores. O sacerdotes. O scortatores. O presbyteros. O sacrilegos. O castos. O priapos. O papistas. O Sodomitas.
