      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable Brigadier HONYWOOD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARLBOROUGH, A POEM. CANTO. I. Ipsa tibi blandos fundent Cunabula flores, Occidet &amp; serpens, &amp; fallax herba veneni Occidet. Virgil. Eclog. 4. Fair Cytherea, and her lovely Train, The am'rous Nymph, and the more am'rous Swain, All ruling Cupid, whom the Lawns obey, Who o'er the Plains bears an imperial Sway; Muse leave a while! Thalia once my Joy, Whilst I Aurora sung, and Sylvia coy, Far hence away, once Darling of my Soul! Now thousands serious Thoughts my Mind controul. Say, shall I draw him in his Glory first? And then unmask him in the mould'ring Dust? That the proud Sons of Man with Dread may see, None Death escapes, none from the Grave is free. The Good, the Wise, the Learned, nor the Great, Nor even Marlb'rough could elude his Fate. If so, vain Man lay boasted Glories by, And think at last you must like Marlb'rough die. Muse with you take the sab'lest Veil you have, And trace him from the Cradle to the Grave! Not daring to attempt th'advent'rous Rode, See Poem, entitled Westminster-Abbey. Dart with his yielding Muse propitious trod; Where ev'ry Sex, where ev'ry Age may see, From ancient Sages to the youthful Gay, The Vertuous, Wise, the Learned, and the Great, The Grave and Sprightly, all must yield to Fate. Just as a Painter in some heav'nly Piece, Draws all the beauteous Features of the Face; But sees a vivid Lustre in the Fair, He can't delineate, but he must despair: With conscious Fear he lays his Pencil by; Rather than fall, he will desist to try. Fain would I draw him in my youthful Lays, But 'tis Presumption to attempt his Praise. With cautious Boldness strike the tremb'ling Lyre! Marlb'rough I sing, my Breast with Ardour fire! Whilst on his Mother's Breast the Infant lies, She reads the future Hero in his Eyes. Smile, mighty Boy, and let thy Father see, What coming Honours are ordain'd for thee! In thy presaging Looks thy Parents read, How all admire thee, while th'are forc'd to dread. But I desist the rising Boy to sing, When nought but childish Toys Delight could bring: Or when the Down his riper Years confest, And greater Thoughts infus'd into his Breast: When Hobby-Horse and Whip neglected lay, Those Trifles slighted for more manly Play: (Arthur in thought) upon the martial Plain The Captain draws up all his youthful Train. Thus he endeavours for an early Fame, Proud of the Glories of a Warrior's Name. Say by what Influence of th'indulgent Skies First the predestin'd Hero knew to rise? On what first Steps the smiling Pow'rs above Their Darling plac'd in their kind fost'ring Love? The lovely Youth, for his attracting Grace, Among the regal Trains decreed a Place. His Prince's Fav'rite, to his Bosom dear, By all admir'd, the Darling of the Fair. Just as bright Venus, Glory of the Sky, Eclipses all the meaner Planets nigh; So Churchill, Honour to the great Resort, The meaner Glories of the British Court. What, to exalt him in his growing Fame, Added the Lustre of a Patriot's Name? Rome, oft' the dire Disturber of our Rest, Her ancient Feuds nurs'd in her hellish Breast. She ne'er beholds fair Albion's blissful State, But importunes the Skies against her Fate; Curses the Stars propitious to our Land, Damns the kind Pow'rs that rule with peaceful Hand. Oft' we'd been damn'd, had envious Rome the Pow'r, Oft' as she wafts her feeble curses o'er! Not all that Drake in Eighty-eight could do, That dreadful Æra of the Papal Woe! Nor the Detection of the dark Design, Contriv'd against James his pacifick Reign, Can e'er suppress their Luciferian Jars: A Type of Michael's, and of Satan's Wars. This England saw when the next James bore Sway, Saw the impending Storm, and threat'ning Day: But the kind Guardian Angels of our Land, That always hover o'er Britannia's Strand, Perceiv'd th'approaching Peril from a-far; And, to assist us, sent an Eastern Star. All this great Churchil too shrewdly foreknew, And justly ponder'd what he best should do. “Shall I ungrateful from that Prince retreat, “Whose chief Endeavours were to make me great? “Or shall I help to bring my Country's Doom? “And tamely see Britannia yield to Rome? “I ne'er can do't. What will my Country say, “If Churchil strives to raise a Popish Sway? “Tho' I oppose him, yet I grateful bow, “Who loyal was, while Loyalty was due: The great Man hurry'd thus amidst Alarms, On Thoughts mature he fled to Nassau's Arms. And who that Albion loves, says why do fly? For what he fought was precious Liberty. While soaring Ammon, feigned Son of Jove, Of Honour greedy, for sole Empire strove; Whose tow'ring Nature, and whose boundless Mind; Stoop'd at no less than Ruler of Mankind. While mighty he Great Alexander flies Around the World, mix'd with fictitious Lyes; Britannia's Hero shall his Death survive, And not a Murd'rer, but a Patriot live. Ammon's Endeavour was the Great to be: Marlb'rough's, Preserver of our Liberty. Pure Liberty! Delight of all Mankind! Daughter to Mercy! Of a Race Divine! Fair Albion's Glory! which alone we boast; When thou art gone, then Brittain's all is lost. 'Tis you secure the Monarch on his Throne, Hold fast his Scepter, and defend his Crown. 'Tis you command the Subjects to obey: Such is the Love attends an easy Sway! In you alone rich Poverty is found; For you with Joy the Peasant tills the Ground. You Beds of Straw convert to Beds of Down: 'Tis you the Rich, and Poor, with Comfort crown, For you alone we're lavish of our Blood. Lastly, 'tis you that makes the Sov'reign Good. If Marlb'rough fought for such a heav'nly thing, What Muse for Marlb'rough can deny to sing? But I desist to draw the mighty Man, To spin his Thread thro' glorious Whilliam's Reign. Whilliam a Prince of ever deathless Fame! Who bears immortal Trophies in his Name! CANTO. II. Erunt etiam altera bella, At? iterum ad Trojam magnus mittetur Achilles. Virg. Eclog. 4. The next great Work of the Aonian Maid, How ANNE commanded, how the Chief obey'd. Her Troops from far Bellona rouz'd again, And call'd promiscuous Heroes on the Plain. Th'insolent Spaniard, and lascivious Gaul, With their Allies conspire fair Albion's Fall. Vain their Attempts! they to their Peril strive, While mighty Marlb'rough, and Eugenio live. Italians brave from ancient Latium's Coast, (That can a Scipio and Eugenio boast!) And valiant Chiefs from fam'd Brittannia's Strand, Meet their Associates on Batavia's Land. Dreadful in Arms the mighty Chiefs appear; And in Germania fix the Scene of War. Keyserswert first the bloody Scene is made, Where valiant Souls at Marlb'rough's Feet were laid. Landau the next, Landau begun to groan, At weight of Heroes sent by Marlb'rough down. Then Venlo next receiv'd the dire Alarms, Forc'd, like the rest, to yield to Marlb'rough's Arms. Whilst at St. Michael, no inferior Name To Cutts was rais'd; Cutts of illustrious Fame! Liege, Stevenswert, and Ruremond, like the rest, Th'Effects of his all conqu'ring Sword confest. The Heroe with victorious Laurels crown'd, And big with Conquests, to his Home return'd; Where the whole Land, with one united Tongue, With Acclamations fill'd, loud Pœans sung. ANNA with grateful Joy her Chief receiv'd, And own'd the Man, thro' whom secure she liv'd. The Queen and Subjects in one Voice combin'd, And in the Praises of the Patriot join'd. To breath a while not long the Chief had lain, But Conquest calls him to the next Campaign. Mars fires his Troops, the Brittish Lyons roar, And Marlb'rough's call'd again to Belgia's Shore. Brittain's true Sons, Retainers of the Blood, That in bold Arthur's Veins and Edward's flow'd; For Battle panting, for the Field they long, Desirous to revenge their Countrey's Wrong. At Eckeren the dreadful Scene is laid, Where they encreas'd the Number of the dead. Why should I tell the many Conquests won By Marlbro's Arms, at Limbourg, Huy, and Bonne? The Bard that would in equal Numbers write, Needs a Mæonian, or a Mantuan Flight. Namur and Blenheim speak the Hero's Fame: And Schellenberg extols his glorious Name. Of Hochstet's Fight how shall I ought relate? With Gallia's big, and with Bavaria's Fate. Where the fam'd Danube with his rapid Streams, (Danube the Rival of our glorious Thames!) His fertile Banks with swelling Waves o'erflow'd; Encreas'd with Spanish, and with Gallick Blood. There valiant Chiefs, Blainvill and Baulme lay dead, Nor could his mighty Sire procure him Aid, But far from that, he was a Captive ta'en, Fallard! a greater Trophy there than slain, Say of our Chiefs, who felt the fatal Blow? There valiant Dormer fell, Forbes, Cornwall, Row. Light lie the Dust, and may ye Patriots rest, And find Above Rewards among the Blest! Thus dreadful Marlb'ro', Terror to his Foes, Of Conquest certain wheresoe'er he goes, He, wisely bold, attack'd the hostile Lines: Glory of which Exploit Cadogan shines: There, by his Conduct, more than vulgar Fame, Added a Brightness to his former Name. Next Ramellies (that rais'd the mighty He, To his Meridian in the brightest Sky) Call'd him to add new Glories to his Name, To lessen Bourbon's and Bavaria's Fame. There Averquerque, the Belgian Star, acquir'd No vulgar Name, by Marlb'ro's Ardour fir'd. There Villeroy in vain your Valour show, For know, weak Man, 'tis Marlb'rough is your Foe. He Fortune's Darling, Fav'rite of the Sky, Round whom ten thousand Guardian Angels fly; Him they protect, him from the Sword defend; Balls fly in vain, round whom those Angels tend: Ghent, Dendermond, Ostend, and many more; Too late are forc'd to own the Heroe's Pow'r: How Fortune turns! See in the next Campaign, French and Bavarians Masters of the Plain! Triumph, Oh Bourbon! and Bavaria boast! Not long ordain'd to be the conqu'ring Host. Tread on the Serpent, and enrag'd, he'll turn! Marlb'ro' incense, and more inflam'd he'll burn! The Loss to ransom of the former Field, Lisle, Brussels, to his Arms are forc'd to yield. The Gauls unable longer Fight to bear, Marlb'ro's impetuous Force, and Brunt of War; Their drooping Hearts sink in their weary'd Breast; They sue for Peace, and long to be at Rest. Their tim'rous Souls are shock'd at Marlb'ro's Name, And by their Dread confirm the Heroe's Fame. Not here his Vict'ries stop; Blaregnies yield And own the Patriot Master of the Field! Villars proceed, Boufflers do all you can, T'oppose the Conquests of the mighty Man; But all in vain! the Heavens smile to see, The grand Preserver of our Liberty, So bravely scourge usurping Tyranny. Conscious of this Blangies and Sansart's Wood Faten'd with Gallick, and Bavarian Blood. Presumptious Muse no farther dare prolong, His boundless Victims in th'advent'rous Song! He that would justly sing how Marlb'rough fought, Should wing his Flight in Strains as Milton wrote. But who with soaring Boldness aims so high, To trace from Fight, to Fight, the mighty He? Who can describe Mars dreadful in the Field, Mars with his dazling Helm, and blazing Shield, May with just Pride the glorious Heroe sing, May strike the sounding Lyre, and martial String. Thus stands the Man; but not from Envy free, For with Regret she looks above the Sky. Envy the greatest Haunter of the Court, That always finds in Palaces resort; That ne'er can see the God-like Heroe rise, But damns his Fate, and blames th'impartial Skies. Spleen frets her Soul, gauls her invenom'd Heart, She finds a racking Pain in ev'ry Part; A putrid Gore puffs up her heaving Breast: Her livid Eye-lids ne'er can close to rest, But always thinks the envy'd Object near, And (had she Pow'r) she would that Nothing tear. But 'twas too late—unsully'd stood his Fame: Whilst all the World was fill'd with Marlb'ro's Name. CANTO. III. Pallada mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque Turres. Horat. Lib. 1. Od. 4. View the fam'd Man, (but with no vulgar Eye) Whom the loud Trump has sounded to the Sky! Is this the Man that made so many yield? This he that mow'd down Harvests in the Field? He before whom so many thousands fled? Who so encreas'd the Numbers of the Dead? Who fill'd the World with his tremendous Name? Who's rais'd unto the utmost height of Fame? Can't so much Glory bribe relentless Fate? And purchase for his Life a longer Date? Not all those Honours hinder Fate to come? Must God-like Marlb'rough moulder in the Tomb? Can't he, who stopt so many Heroes Breath, Oppose th'inexorable Hand of Death? [illeg.] the mighty Arthur's gone before, And Edward yielded to th'all-conqu'ring Pow'r. Nor stubborn Harry could prevent his Doom; But for the regal Throne possess'd a Tomb. Imperious Cromwel, and the great Nassau, (Tho with Regret) bow'd to the fatal Law. And he who Europe fill'd with loud Alarms, Yielded at last to more potential Arms. Like him our British Lewis must resign, And be succeeded in the regal Line: Must to another leave the royal Throne, The ruling Scepter, and majestick Crown: Must lay his glorious Robes of Pow'r aside, When Death shall strip him of his cumbrous Pride. Illustrious George shall next his Sire succeed; Whom Friends admire, and ev'ry Foe shall dread. When here below his Princely Part is done, He for a Grave leaves his paternal Throne. But long ye Sisters draw the fatal Clew, That both may live Scourges to Albion's Foe! Like him Cadogan must resign his Breath, And own the irresistless Pow'r of Death. Nor you great Honywood must hope to shun Th'inevitable Race these Heroes run. You like the rest must once resign your Breath, And sleep obscurely in the Bands of Death. The Fair no more shall love your mould'ring Charms, Nor the Foe dread your once tremendous Arms, When the damp Ashes mix among your Race, And Verse shall only tell the Heroe was. But long may you the vital Journey run! Proceed a Patriot, as you have begun! Advent'rous Muse reduce the wand'ring Song: Subjects like these to greater Bards belong. The God-like Champion being almost dead, Describe the Mortal sick'ning on his Bed. Behold those Brows with Terror once severe, Behold those Eyes once sparkling for the War; See the pale Brow; gaze on the languish'd Eye: The once great Breast breaks in a piteous Sigh. All that of Dread an Object was before, Flies at one Gasp, is gone, and is no more! At last our Brittish Mars is forc'd to yield, He once War's greatest Weapon in the Field; Swift as the Eagle with the Lyon's Flame; Who never from the Battle empty came. How is the Mighty fall'n! the Valiant gone! At last the Thunderbolt of War is flown! So the tall Oak, that many Harvests stood, Rev'rend with Age, the Glory of the Wood, Where the soft Nymphs have oft for Umbrage run, And Swains to shade them from the scorching Sun. Or when great Jove descends in show'ry Rain, And drives with Storms the Rusticks from the Plain. Oft' the kind hospitable Tree has spread, His Leavy Honours to protect their Head, Thro' eating Years the mould'ring Trunk decay'd, His folial Glories sheds upon the Ground; With one great Crack at last he tumbles down. Ye Sons of Glory blooming now and brave, Who wait upon your Master to the Grave; Make one Reflection on the mighty He, And think as he now is, you once must be. That Man! that Corps! that Piece of mould'ring Clay! Like you once shone in Glory's bright Array, Such are the sure impartial Laws of Fate, To which are bound the Valiant and the Great: All at the fatal Hour must yield their Breath, The Prince, or Peasant, all alike to Death: With equal Foot knocks at the Palace Door, As proud to enter Cottages of Poor. Ye Sons of Man, snatch a quick Thought sedate! And ponder well upon the Heroe's Fate! See what had Wisdom, Conduct, Valour, dead! Nor could those Charms prologue the fatal Thread! When the Idea to your Eyes is shown, Think Marlb'ro's Fate must one Day be your own! FINIS.</field>
