      <field name="fulltext">Attende cur negare cupidis debeas, Modestis etiam offerre, quod non petierint. Phædrus. MUNIFICENCE and MODESTY,A POEM; The Hint from a Painting of GUIDO. O voice of APPROBATION, bless The spirits still demanding less, The more their natures have to need, The more their services can plead; The more their mighty merits claim— The voice of Approbation came. Fair MODESTY, divinely sweet, With garb prepared, and lamp replete, Lamented still from sun to sun So much received, and nothing done. Her abstinence was insincere, Her studies not enough severe; Her thoughts at fault, and still to seek, Her words inadequate and weak; Her actions wretched and restrain'd, Her passions neither balk'd nor rein'd. Her head she waved in meek distrust, Her eyes were fix'd to read the dust; Her cheeks were tinctured to receive The blushes of the crimson eve, Prophetic of a better day, When thus she framed her hymn to pray. “O Thou, whose bounties never fail, “Who smil'st upon the lowly vale, “And giv'st fertility and peace “Their flow'ry lawn and golden fleece; “Who send'st the spirit of the breeze, “To bend the heads of stately trees, “Till pines with all their state and rank, “Bow like the bullrush on the bank. “Who bid'st the little brook flow on, “And warbling sooth the silent swan, “And spreading form the shaded lake, “Untill th'emerging rays retake “The transcript of the scene to Thee, “O FATHER of SIMPLICITY. “As this thy glossy turf I press, “And prostrate on my forehead bless, “Consider for the poor infirm, “The harmless sheep, th'obnoxious worm, “The stooping yoke that turn the soil, “And all the children of thy toil. “In fine, of all the num'rous race, “Of all that crowd and ought to grace “Thy vast immeasurable board, “To me the lowest lot afford.” She bow'd, she sigh'd, and made her pause: And instantly th'immense applause Of thunder in the height was heard, And all the host of Heav'n appear'd. And thro' the great and glorious throng, Of Seraphims, ten thousand strong Came down that prince of high degree, Th'archangel Liberality. A crown of Beryls graced his head, His wings were closed, his hands were spread; His stature nobler than the rest, A sun and belt adorn'd his breast; His voice was rapture to the ears, His look like GRANBY in his geers; When lighting on the dewy sod, Thus spake the Almoner of God. “Survey these scenes from east to west, “All earth in bloom and verdure drest; “Those olives planted by the line, “That forrest after God's design. “Those naked rocks that rise to bound, “The vine-invested elms around; “The golden meads that far extend, “And to the silver streams descend. “Those fields of corn in youthful green, “Where larks prepare the nest unseen. “Or turn your eyes, immortal Fair, “To yon gay walks of art and care, “Where the throng'd hive their sweets augment, “And murmur not, but thro' content. “That long canal so clear and deep, “Unmoved, but by the Crusion's leap; “That Grotto, which from Gani's mines, “And Ocean's ransack'd bosom shines. “I, whose commission's to dispense “The mead of God's munificence, “To thy undoubted worth resign, “These joys of thought and sense, as thine.” I ask not (Modesty replied) For wealthy regions far and wide; I rest content, if you but spare, What is the utmost of my pray'r; A little cot my frame to house, With room enough to pay my vows. “Then take a view of yonder tow'rs, “Where Fortune deals her gifts in showr's; “Where that vast bulwark's proud disdain “Runs a long terras on the main; “Whose strong foundation Ocean laves, “And bustles with officious waves, “To bring with many a thousand sail, “Whate'er refinement can regale; “Rich fruits of oriental zest, “Perfumes of Araby the blest, “With precious ornaments to wear, “Upon thine hands, thy neck, thy hair: “O Queen of the transcendent few, “All decoration is thy due.” Remote from cities and their noise Serenity herself enjoys, And free from grandeur and expence, Had best be cloath'd with innocence. “If such thine elevated mind, “Chuse pleasures for thy sex design'd; “A blooming youth I will provide, “To make thee a transported bride; “To give each day some new delight, “And bless the soft connubial night. I may not act a double part, And offer a divided heart; Let other nymphs their swains endear, For my affections are not here. “Accomplish then that great desire, “To which the wise and good aspire; “A name that no detraction knows, “Whose fragrance is as Sharon's rose; “Which makes the highest flight of fame, “By vast and popular acclaim.” O rather may I still refrain, Nor run the risk of being vain; To peace and silence let me cleave, And give the glory—not receive. “Yet, yet accept a gift of love, “The royal Sceptre and the Dove; “All things on earth thou shalt command, “Whatever heart, whatever hand; “Why are those charming looks aground? “Arise, aspire, thou shalt be crown'd.” Talk not of crowns—I have no will, No power, no thought.—“No more, be still. “Who's there?” The vast Cherubic flight, Of thousand thousands on the right. “Who's there?” 'Tis ORIEL and his SONG, Full eighty thousand legions strong.— “Hand from the nether Zenith down “The chariot with the emeral'd crown “By Phœnix drawn.—Lo! this is SHE, “Which has atchieved the first degree; “And scorning Mammon and his leav'n, “Has won Eternity and Heav'n.” FEMALE DIGNITY, INSCRIBED AND APPLIED TO Lady HUSSEY DELAVAL. I Whate'er the sense, whate'er the face, Whate'er the beauties all combin'd; 'Tis Dignity, that gives the grace, And forms the Fair, as first design'd. Thro' life we have a sterling rule To make the noblest points our aim; And Dignity commands the school Of all that excellence, we claim. II O never yet the gift of chance, Or bought by wealth, or forced by pow'r; For Thee, the Champion grasps his lance, For Thee, the flights of Fancy tow'r. Thine is the great and perfect praise Of fathers kind, and lovers true; Stern censure smiles thy worth to blaze, And owns the myrtle wreath thy due. III 'Tis Dignity, supports the song By sense to choicest sounds allied; The Muses do the Graces wrong, Unless her influence preside. O Fountain of all Female worth, That play'st so sweet and so sublime; To feed the flow of decent mirth, The pride of PLACE, the life of TIME. IV Hail Condescension, heav'nly mild, By which no Majesty is lost; Thee Faith and Truth their Queen have styl'd, And still with awful love accost. On Thee, ten thousand blessings wait, In bright succession without pause; If, CHARMER, thou hast found thy mate, His name is HONOUR and APPLAUSE. EPITAPH, On HENRIETTA, Late Dutchess of CLEVELAND. Born in those days, when Charity revived, And from the Champion of the Church derived, We claim a portion in the HOUSE of GRACE For her, whose relicts shall adorn the place: For her, who cherish'd with a mother's care, And fill'd the Orphan's mouth with praise and pray'r. Form'd for these deeds she bore her fruit above, And left no issue to connubial love. Yet was the noble matron well sustain'd, And true politeness served, where prudence reign'd. She check'd all thoughts in which the tempter lurks, By keeping Fancy busied on her works.— A taste for hist'ry with a gen'rous aim, And strict attention to her country's fame.— A skill in picture, genius in design, 'Twas nature copy'd nature line for line. Such were her merits, when her faith was tried, And to attain diviner things, she died.— Amen.—The paths of life so justly trod, Bespeak the welcome due, thro' CHRIST, from GOD. EPITAPH On HENRY FIELDING, Esq. The Master of the Greek and Roman page, The lively scorner of a venal age, Who made the publick laugh, at publick vice, Or drew from sparkling eyes the pearl of price; Student of nature, reader of mankind, In whom the patron, and the bard were join'd; As free to give the plaudit, as assert, And faithful in the practice of desert. Hence pow'r consign'd the laws to his command, And put the scales of Justice in his hand; To stand protector of the Orphan race, And find the female penitent a place. From toils like these, too much for age to bear, From pain, from sickness, and a world of care; From children, and a widow in her bloom, From shores remote, and from a foreign tomb, Call'd by the WORD of LIFE, thou shalt appear, To please and profit in a higher sphere, Where endless hope, unperishable gain, Are what the scriptures teach and entertain. [Sacred] Sacred To the Memory of the Rev'd James Sheeles, A. B. Late of Trinity College, In the University of Cambridge; And by the Honourable Patronage of the Earl of Northumberland, Minister of ? this Parish; A young Gentleman of great Hopes, And singular benevolence: Who having served in the Church No longer than one year and three months, Was remanded to his Master On the 29th day of October, 1762. In the 24th year of his age. His affectionate father Has indulged his grief With this tribute to his ashes. O young, yet apt and able in the word, And at the morning-call to Christ preferr'd! Our hope was longer time, and more commands, So great the harvest, and so scarce the hands!— See how the likeliest are not lent to last, And love officious calculates too fast. —If God had left thy lot for human praise, A father's pray'r had multiplied thy days. But since to grieve is now the task injoin'd, We've learnt full well to weep, and be resign'd; Nay more, adore and bless the great decree, And, in the spirit, still commune with Thee. Let God's good will, at our expence be done, As Christ demands a brother and a son. The famous general EPITAPH Of DEMOSTHENES. Translated from the Original GREEK. These for their Country's cause were sheath'd in arms And all base imputations dared despise; And nobly struck with Glory's dreadful charms, Made death their aim, eternity their prize. For never could their mighty spirits yield, To see themselves and country-men in chains; And Earth's kind bosom hides them in the field Of battle, so the WILL SUPREME ordains; To conquer chance and error's not reveal'd, For mortals sure mortality remains. The END.</field>
