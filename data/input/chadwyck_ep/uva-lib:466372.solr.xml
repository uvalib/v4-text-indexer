      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGIC MARY DRAMATIS PERSONÆ Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots Henry, Lord Darnley, King Consort James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell James Stuart, Earl of Moray James Douglas, Earl of Morton William Maitland of Lethington, Secretary of State The Earl of Lennox, Scottish Nobleman The Earl of Huntly, Scottish Nobleman Patrick, Lord Ruthven, Scottich Nobleman Arthur Erskine, Captain of the Guard Stuart of Traquair, An Equerry Killigrew, English Ambassador Kircaldy, Laird of Grange Lady Bothwell, Sister to the Earl of Huntly Mary Seaton, The Queen's Lady Mary Fleming, The Queen's Lady Mary Livingstone, The Queen's Lady Margaret Carwood, The Queen's Lady Elspeth Menteith, Sister-in-Law to Lethington John Hepburn, Bothwell's Retainer Hay of Talla, Bothwell's Retainer Paris, Bothwell's Servant Blackadder, Bothwell's Servant Lords, Soldiers, Attendants, Pages Time—The Evening of March 9, 1566, to the Evening of June 15th, 1567 ACT I Scene I —Holyrood; a distant apartment Bothwell paces to and fro Bothwell She banished me, she did not like my manners; She banished me, and yet a time shall come When the dire fetters of a marriage-bond Shall keep us ever locked.—How coldly March Whistles through every chink! I hear the tread Of stealthy feet which seem to move along, As surely and as soothingly as wind, Upward to Darnley's room: while far away I catch the twanging of an instrument— ’Tis Riccio's lute—and, as a door swings back, Her laughter. I shall win her! Yesterday I rode my horse straight down a steep decline With a clear rush: when I came round again There was a look within her eyes that never Had graced the sleek Italian, nor the boy She calls her husband; yea, her lips were void Of life's least sigh. A second, and she smiled A glinting smile, and turned away, and talked Half gaily of light things. My manhood feels The terror it encloses.—All is silent, The noise is shut away that seemed to mount Up yonder. (Opening a door at back and calling) Boy! Enter Paris Paris My lord! Bothwell Go to the foot Of the great stair and listen, for I heard Some unfamiliar movements, yet as slight As if a bird had thumped against the walls. Exit Paris That fiddler Riccio, that smooth vagabond, With ribboned lute, and fat, complacent cheeks, Has ceased, methinks, his strumming. Re-enter Paris Well, what caused The flutter? Paris I stood hearkening, sir: all seemed As homely as most nights, until I heard A shivering cry, and then a dull, hoarse roar, With far-off cries repeated. I am certain It is not in the court; it seemed to fall, And fall from upper storeys on the ear. What can it be? Bothwell Stand quietly! How it grows: The doors are opened, and the turmoil leaps On like a rush of heart-blood, deluging The air. I will not meddle in the brawl, For we but hear Lord Darnley in his cups; This is a drunken bout; we will keep close Till all is tranquil. Paris I have never heard The king so loud. Bothwell Truly, to-night he seems More quarrelsome than merry. Paris Now there rings Great laughter through the darkness. Bothwell And I hear Arms clanging like its echo: soon as steel Is on the move a man may show his face, Who hides it from mere riot. Quick, unbolt! (He throws open the door at the back and discovers within the hall, Darnley, Morton, and the Conspirators dragging along Riccio's body) Darnley She loved him—hump and all. The foreign dog! He had no manners when he came to die; He whined and pulled her skirts. She does not know A gentleman's true mark, has no perception Of exquisite deportment. Why, this churl Would chatter like an ape when I stood by, Stretch his gay leg out—thus! and set his lute To balance on his toe. It made me sick Through all my body, and she only laughed, And said the merry South was in his veins; We have not left him much Italian blood With which to smirk and wriggle. Morton As I set My heel upon his clay, I feel my acres Are sacred from spoliation. Ruthven Snuff and candles! I feel my hatred eased, my lustful fire Of vengeance on the flicker. Darnley All of you Rejoice that your own injuries are ended, Your fears assuaged, but no one thinks of me— How they would talk together, till he made Her lips shine with the ripple of her words, She grew so fluent. When I dressed and came To stand beside her, she would briefly give Her eyes to admiration, and then seek His place among the singers. He has curdled My blood with spite, and, see! my hanger sticks Midmost of all the weapons in his body. Bothwell (Apart to Paris) Ker, Morton, yonder Ruthven, who is gaunt As if the hollow night had yielded up A ghost to do live crime—all are my foes; And by the storm of feet about the courtyard I fear they hold the palace. Their success Might turn to my annoyance. And the queen! Is she in safety? Call my Borderers—ho! (Paris steals to the door and is stopped. Bothwell advances) Darnley These men are mine, and they protect my person, While I do tardy justice for my wrongs. This fellow kept from me my crown. Morton From us He well-nigh took our lands. We could no more Endure his watchful envy. Ruthven I have flung A deadly sickness off, and from my bed Risen to exact my vengeance. Detestation Coursed through my frame like health, and I am here. Bothwell Is the queen safe? Ruthven Unwilling to be rid Of one who had bewitched her, she called out And sprang before him. I have never seen Such sight except in hunting, when a creature Stands up against the hounds. Morton But no rebellion Is dreamt of toward our sovereign, for her husband Is leader of our enterprise and sanctions With bond and promise everything we do. Ruthven They feasted—how unconscious of their fate, Caught in the web of that small supper-room . . . Morton You stumble, man; go up and have a draught Of wine; the bottles in the cabinet Are not all broken, and with you the king Shall reascend to give his wife some comfort. Darnley Now I have served him out, I shall possess The matrimonial crown, which she withheld To please the fellow's malice. Oh, revenge Can satisfy more utterly than love; It kills its object, and the thing is dead, And cannot reassert itself, nor once Dispute our triumph. ’Tis a cleanly issue, That wipes away all foulness and prevents A lingering stink from the putridity Of vain abhorrence. Morton Ay, we kill the vermin That injures or betrays: you realise The sweetness of destruction. By and bye Return and tell us how the queen is faring; We would not wish her troubled. Exeunt Darnley and Ruthven upstairs (To Bothwell) You, my lord, Can have no reason for disquiet. Grown weary Of this man's greed and influence, we ended His life and our great danger. You shall please The king if you retire; it is his quarrel Fully as much as ours. Bothwell I will. Porter (Coming from the central door) Strip off These furs, these silks and velvets from the clay. He was but dirt when he was shovelled here From over seas. He lay upon this coffer The night of his arrival. Heave him up! And let the old oak be a bed for him The night he goes away. How shabbily He slept in rusty cloth! Off with the trappings! He looks the stranger now. (Bothwell and Paris return and shut the door behind them) Bothwell Paris, I never Have felt before just what a body is: We need be full of schemes, resolves, pursuits, Reckless adventure, master-strokes of passion, While yet we live; since death annuls all zest In slavish unconcern. That Riccio, boy, Was of a teeming mettle and contrived To grow in honours—now he couches yonder, And cares for nothing. Paris, what a face! It makes me greedy to exhaust desire, And pack the years with enterprise. Paris My lord, I never saw such dagger-work in France As that which pierced him. Six and fifty wounds! Bothwell I have so much to hope, so much to do! O happiness! I only look on death To feel life's manifold inducements grow More glorious and hazardous than ever They were before; my every appetite, Each mighty muscle in me seems to shout As through a lifted trumpet: I will live, I will possess, and let the universe Endure my depredations! Paris, we Have carried slaughter over tawny moors, The bog-indented borderlands, and snatched Their prey from felons: thus from destiny, The robber-goddess of the world, brave spirits Must capture what she rifles as she runs. I will at once to work, to opposition, To covert enmity, to sudden flight. Those men are false; they make their queen their captive, And I alone can save her from her doom, By saving first myself. Paris God shield us, sir! That is the city-bell. Bothwell A demon-crash Of terror up above us; the black air Reverberates with action—cries and peals. We must not lose the moment. Let us thrust The window open. Can yon jump the height? Your supple age will help you. Paris Give the word! Bothwell Leap! I will follow. (Paris springs down) Darnley's thanklessness Pushes in my direction: she will scorn him With that sick scorn that only women know Which wastes away all pity. I have felt No being worth the trouble to my nature That patience is, save her,—for whom I cherish A fierce fidelity that means to cleave, Until it grow to ownership. The winds Rock about Arthur's Seat, and I could fancy That in their sound my ancestors bewail The unfulfilled ambition of their love For queens—the high Jane Beaufort, and that Margaret Whom Flodden made a widow. I will aim Above their boldest mark, and will succeed Because more mad. My race was amorous ever Of sovereign figures. (Springs down) From the little garden Below, the lions are roaring through the wind, Free-throated captives: on this further side The tumult in the court is pigmy-toned, And murder is unnoticed. To Dunbar! Scene II —Holyrood; the King's audience-chamber Enter Darnley, Morton, Ruthven and others Darnley She braves me to my face; oh, worse! she lets Her breath come like a poniard through her lips In steely sighs; her glance is roused and dark, Full of the levin and the thunder-rain. She said she would not lie with me, nor come And prattle in my chamber any more; She broke from all obedience—ay, and promised ’T would be dear blood for some of us: her face Flushed briefly as she said it. Let her threaten And do her worst. Morton You do not care? Darnley Not I. Care for a woman's anger! Morton Did she rage? Darnley Yes, silently; indeed, I never heard Her voice so still: folk at a funeral Have scarce a lower cadence. When she poured The wine for Ruthven I could see she thought Of blood, she moved so sudden to his side, And held it ’gainst the flame. Morton You do not care? Darnley Why should you pester with your repetition? Care, do you ask?—And yet she looked away, Tears in the van of sight, and such a smile Upon her lips, I tingled: while I stood Fronting her heedless face, years came and went, Before the moments forced me to retreat, As she was turning toward me once again With new-illumined wrath. Morton You do not care, And that is well, for we must make clean breast Of all our thoughts touching the queen, yourself, And us, your sworn confederates. To the door You shall not go. We executed murder With you, and you must give us from henceforth Protection and fidelity. Darnley My lords, As I began . . . Morton Nay, that is not enough; As you began you must continue. Now There can be no retracing of the way; You cannot climb again to the far verge Of your attempt, and if you once look back You are as good as dead. Darnley God's sake! You gather Most rudely all about me. Of a truth You are not courteous and you are not faithful; You call me an assassin, when your swords Slew Riccio. Sirs, I will not thus be baited. Stand further off! Now what is your complaint That you should stifle me with shoulders thus Set round me, and intolerable speech? Where have I failed to please you? Morton Nay, not failed; We would instruct you, bid you recognise Your destiny is welded into ours By doom, by justice, by this written bond. Do not shrink back, and do not misconceive Our warning and entreaties. We exact From you but courage; you must make yourself Our leader, and our captain in affairs From which you will not budge. Darnley I am your king. What further do you want? Ruthven Good Lord! You wanted The matrimonial crown. Darnley And have it now. Morton What is a crown derived, a crown that clips The short curls of a man because he weds, That owns the woman's rule! Darnley It irks my heart To be her paltry follower, her mere shadow. Morton Then from our hands receive the crown itself; Be more than leader, sovereign: then we march Wherever you shall list, as you command Will do . . . But play the coward!— Darnley My senses whirl: You seem to threaten and you seem to offer Kingship and service. Do not press around With good and evil meanings. To your wishes I give a strained attention. Morton I will use The plainest words: if once you waver, once Forsake our company, you will not find That we are jesters who make light of speech; You will be met by earnest, silent men, Who handle an irrefragable bond, And care not how they punish the offence Of breaking its least claim. Darnley You do me wrong, And your distrust is harsh and insolent. Admit my father to this colloquy; I am alone ’mong many counsellors, And need more judgment than my youth possesses. You dazzle me and trouble, for you talk With fervid, strange unkindness. Morton We admit Lennox; he joined in our conspiracy. Summon the earl. Exit one of the Conspirators Ruthven My head, my head! Morton You suffer! Ruthven. Regard me not,—as yet my wits are mine To listen to your motions. Morton Look at him! Ruthven Check-mated. Morton Ay. Darnley (Apart) My heart is in my mouth; They are obscure and deathly in their manner, And in their speech constraining. Oh, alone! My mind is diverse as a sapling-tree To and fro i' the wind. I have no help; She is upstairs. I know not what to do. She would not lift her hand to succour me, Although she is so prompt and politic. How came I looped about by all those coils? I breathe in giddy ignorance. O God, My deed of vengeance was direct and simple, What treasonous net is this they make of it? Enter Lennox Father! Morton My lord, our triumph you have heard; The villain is despatched, the queen is weeping Within her room, our prisoner, and the palace Is by our men invested. This your son In modesty is fearful to receive From us the title which his wife has lost, Ruler of Scotland. Lennox He were best contented With what his marriage gave him. Morton Folly, man! He must secure our lives and liberties By the indemnity of that great name That makes ill-doing loyal. Ruthven For he is king, Crowned by our voices, sceptred by the dagger He left in Riccio's flesh! And if our king— What of the queen? Morton She has but one defence: The fate of giving birth is on her now; That is her nearer destiny. Methinks No blossom that has fruited brags of life, Or tarries for the winter. Well-a-day, Destruction has a future. Darnley (Apart) They are cruel, My blood is warm with fear. Ruthven In high-set Stirling The woman shall be happy; she can rock Her bairnie's cradle, sing the lullaby, Or strain her bow-string on the garden plot: While with their sovereign-king her faithful nobles Do the man's work and govern. Morton Will her chicken Prove boy or lass? Ruthven A tetchy, female thing; Its dam is weak in colour. Of myself I wager it is feminine. Morton Perchance Some will denounce us. Ruthven At their least attempt To wrest the queen away, we mince her up, And toss her from the terrace. Morton All is even And straight for our advantage. Let us part; Long counsel hinders consequence. (To Darnley) Heigh there! Darnley What is it. . . . What? Morton A warning! Cleave to us, Or fear the quake of ruin. Exeunt the Lords Darnley Are they gone? All is upturned and fiery in my head; I might be dying, for the arras-trees Tumble together toward me, and the walls On yonder strip lean o'er me rockily As if to crush. Lennox My boy, you must remember We share a common peril. Darnley Hold your peace! A murder is not cruel when the stab Is brisk and of the moment. Riccio fancied No coming wounds, while threat of yiolent chance Heaves through my brain. I am a minor still, And downy on the cheek; they are old men Whom death confronts if they but look at time, For me it is unnatural and shocking An end should haunt my morrow. Lennox We were cozened, And are undone. Darnley A pack of murderous wolves! My desolation stuns me; if I lay Within the lonesome chapel down below I could not be more single. How I fume With projects of escape!—but I must ponder Less hurriedly. That stairway is my access To her, to extrication. Lennox Up! she is Your wife, and yonder passage you command. Darnley True, and there is a pliant afterthought In her excessive rage, a lull to catch. She loved me once, and in her disposition Once to have loved holds fast against all strain: I have a bosom-link if I can reach it, That will not let me drop. Lennox God's sake, ascend. Darnley What noises sough and scurry through the air, And beg for victims; the whole darkness seeks A prey. My auguries are horrible, And I am deadly faint. These little steps Now seem such weary stones. Exit Lennox He will not triumph Without humiliation—that the goal A woman's anger drives at. He is knocking. Darnley (Within) My Mary! Lennox Now he pauses. Darnley (Within) Let me in! Lennox Silence and wind! . . . I cannot hear him, yet He speaks— Re-enter Darnley Darnley She will not open. Go away. If we are found together they will deem We hatch some private business. It is fearful To be alone, but better than with you, For that is dangerous. Lennox Why so it is. Bid me good-night for courtesy, my son. What will you do? Darnley Go up again at dawn. Lennox Plead for your father. Exit Darnley I but called to quiet Beyond that door—no answer and no breath; Only one secret movement as one might Hear a live body stir within the coffin . . . A lunge, then noiseless time. Scene III —Holyrood; the Queen's bed-chamber, in dawn-light. She sits by a chill fire, with her women round her Queen (Shuddering) The wind has dragged my wimple from the spot; His bloodstains are uncovered. Mary Seton Turn away! (Replacing the veil on the floor) Now all is cloaked. Queen You need not fear, my girls, That I shall moan again. Light makes the past Grow strange. Your hand, my Seton. Mary Seton To the window? Queen. Yes. It is really dawn! Ah, I must pray,— (Falling suddenly and passionately on her knees) Poor soul, for he was faithful. Mary Seton (To Mary Fleming) When last even She suffered, sharp and rigid, I was sure Her throes would come, or death. Mary Fleming King Henry's voice Pierced her instead. Mary Seton She never stirred for it; Her eyes grew sable, and I felt her frame Like iron within my arms. Mary Fleming We stood by her After for many hours. Mary Seton You fell asleep. Mary Fleming Nay, I remember . . . Mary Seton When you woke again You found her sitting by the fire alone, With a wild flicker on her open lips. Mary Fleming I fear she is not praying. (The Queen rises) Madam, leave The window. You have faithful friends below. The secretary— Queen Your Lethington? Mary Fleming My queen's True servant, who will hasten to relieve Our fortunes, soon as known. Queen What does he count Against my brutal enemies? A jar Grates in my memory with every pulse That gives me clearer consciousness: the shine Of daybreak lies so broad upon the fact, The outrage, the malevolence. Alas, Entangled night could better be endured Than this discernment. Mary Mother, vainly The matin beauty chastened me. Mary Seton I hear Steps, noisy through their earliness, but fast And upward by the sound. Mary Fleming It is the king; He knocks again. Queen Unbar, my Seton. Pass, Chères amies, to my audience-room awhile. [Apart] My very blood flies from him. Mary Seton (Opening) Sire, come in. Enter Darnley (Apart) He looks as flagging as if hoary age Had caught him in the dark. Exeunt Mary Seton and Mary Fleming within Queen (Preventing Darnley) You shall not kneel. (A pause of silence) Darnley My Mary, ’tis confession, and I come Acknowledging my fault, though late sincerely, With prayers for your indulgence. I am stricken To see you stand like this, an attitude For which no line is fashioned. Turn to me Only a little. I have been decoyed, And dragged into conspiracies against Myself as much as you. Queen Sire, you may ask Forgiveness, but I never can forget The wrong you did me; ’tis indelible As what I saw in childhood, and will haunt My deepest, far, old age. My memory is Most jealous in its pain: you have forgotten The kiss of tender Judas quality You gave me—there is snake-bite on my cheek When I recall its print; you have forgotten The violence of your hands upon my frame A moment after; yea, you have forgotten The bloodshed at my feet, and at my breast The pistol of a comrade; yet more cruel, You had forgotten I was near such state As has its kindly privilege wherever Man is conceived of woman. Darnley (Apart) Oh, her face! I hate her shaming lip.—Is all affection Lost for your husband? Queen ’Tis impossible To search my heart just yet; it is too ruined For any answer. In the sleepless night No stir save that of my endangered babe Has touched me to a feeling or a hope For any soul that lives. You shall not speak Thus nearly of our tie, since you confess That you have been both thankless and disloyal To what in me is sovereign, and the source From which derive your honours. Darnley Would you die A butchered captive? Queen Did you purpose this? Unbosom frankly. Darnley I have been distraught; Ambition has beguiled me. My true princess, I will be traitor to these miscreant lords, Who terrify and threaten. Take these bonds. (Giving her some papers) Queen Unfold them; let me read the articles. Stand off! I will interpret. (After reading) There is mention Here of my ruin, of the overthrow With your connivance of the Catholic, True faith, of your sole kingship: trivial thoughts And weighty matters here are strangely mingled; An enterprise of most malignant folly And mounting, blasphemous intent set down With childish unconcern. Where is the plan Of David's murder? Darnley Do not fix me so With your dead eyes. I think you have no feeling; You are all wan and dry. ’T was the proposal Of these confederate renegades to kill Your servant, and they jeered at me the way A husband cannot brook; but I repent— You do not listen. Queen (Staring at the papers) I have read enough. Take back the papers. Darnley What a grievous sigh Breaks from you! I am surely a lost man, Except I tender pardon to these rebels. Grant them forgiveness; do not let me perish For my first, wanton error. Queen Henry Stuart, Had I inflicted on you the foul'st wrong, The most impenetrable, secret shame That man can suffer, with less cruelty You had devised, in justice, your revenge. O God! to see you scared and garrulous, Who should lie stunned before me. Do you know What you have lost, what perpetrated, what Irreparably injured, that you clamour For life; and will life be of worth to you, Your life, while mine keeps tenure of the past? Hush; leave me! I must put away these fierce And beating memories—for from Holyrood I must devise escape. Remove the watch; Give me some freedom. . . . Stay, you are the father Of Scotland's king, in that respect you claim My tenderest vigilance. Put by your fears. That you could so have used me! You will make Amends for this, I hope. Discharge the watch. Exit Darnley So much to do, so thick a knot to break! (Bending, she writes in her Book of Hours) O Lord, avenge me of my enemies. I set it down; make Thou a bond with me! Have we not common cause? These hypocrites Pull down all holy things. My sturdy mood Bides not the click of rosaries: receive This sentence writ across the martial psalms, And levy for me from the ends of heaven Thy laggard legions; make me, in thy stead, Victor and sovereign. There is stir without I'the courtyard. (Looks out) ’Tis my brother; he has ventured From England for my succour. Ho, my girls! Re-enter Maries Sweet Fleming, help! There is a spring of joy Loosed at my heart. Mary Fleming What comfort? Queen (Pointing to Moray) He forgets That we were enemies; he comes unpardoned To turn the keys on my captivity. I tell you, girls, a few, short weeks ago Had any made me present of his head The proffered gift had pleased, such grievous hate Ingratitude stirs in me. He repents, He seeks me in calamity; no power Henceforward shall estrange us. Am I weeping? Oh, think, my Maries, I looked up to him As my good, elder brother, when his face Was the one, homely thing I saw in France; And he through life has checked and counselled me, So sober is he in his statesmanship; He fought against my marriage—Ah! ’twas that Drove him to England. Enter Moray James, had you been present, You had not suffered them to handle me So cruelly. This kindness on your part, To visit me in prison, sets my tears At once free from their confines. Moray For your sake In sooth, my sister, duteously emboldened, I came from Berwick. Queen You have heard the fate Of David? Moray Such disorders must be quelled. Rely on me, and I will promise you They shall no more recur. Queen Recur—a murder, The murder of my servant at my feet! I have no terror of such repetition Now you are here to help me to take vengeance On David's slaughterers. Moray Speak more tranquilly. It may be that your husband is not clear Of this conspiracy; to shelter him, Best summon these unmannered noblemen, And, with due censure, pardon. Do not break, So vehement!—from my embrace. Your safety Necessitates a politic disguise. Queen (Apart) Then I will feign to him, the palterer! He shall not help me.—James, we will consent To hear you plead for all of those who seek us With reverence on their knees as guilty men. Go, to confer with them. Moray I will remonstrate, And bring them to avowal of their fault: Meanwhile take rest. How haggard are your eyes! You give me anxious thoughts. Exit, after embracing her. Queen Erskine was present When David fell, Traquair was at my side; There are some fearless hearts within the walls. Re-enter Darnley (Apart) Patience! A hail-storm rushes through my blood At sight of him.-What knotted brows, as puzzled By sole and unaccustomed sovereignty! Confide to me, my lord, how you will part Your honours ’mong these malcontents, to whom You owe your exaltation. I bespeak A place for Moray—let him have your love. Darnley I hate him. Queen You have reason; he is heir Through his ambition to your foster-crown. Shall you retain in trust my chancellor? Will Ruthven be in favour? Darnley Do not mock me! Mary, I am entreated as a slave, Threatened with instant ruin, thwarted, bribed; I will do anything to break away From this besetting insolence. I suffer; My life, I fear, is put in jeopardy. Queen Then for sweet life's sake—your's, my lord, I mean, The life you value—trust yourself to me; Go to your chamber, bid Traquair and Erskine Thither to instant colloquy, on show Of some official duty, then dispatch them Hither in secret; I already weave A plan of exit through the Abbey vaults. You look bewildered. Almost I incline— At least I am most covetous to hope This handsome, boyish face has been a witness, A mere vexed witness, of these infamies. Darnley Believe it, Mary; I am still so young . . . Queen In tutelage, remember, then to me. Now we must separate. The open door! (She motions to him to leave her by the main staircase, not the tower-stairs) Darnley Your hand! Queen They will discover us. Exit Darnley Alone, At this slack hour when David used to play! Giustizia, giustizia! I have learnt That watch-word; some day I will give it back, And still the hollow, merry-making sounds That ’gin to whistle when I turn to rest. It will be dark to-night within the vaults, And cold: my babe is stretching forth young limbs, Life's easy way. If I were struck stone-dead For horror at the grim, distorted tombs; If I should bring forth a strange, spectral child, To catch the bats that flit from roof to roof, And wink at daylight! God, it shall not be! For I will nurse him royally with my soft, Wild, wayward songs, and he shall lie and laugh Across my knees, until the happy tune Drop off into a drowse. Enter Erskine and Traquair Good Erskine, come! Traquair! kneel both of you, and vail your brows, For you are young to touch the mystery Of which I bear the burthen . . . I commend To you the guarding of my motherhood, As simply as I trust my soul to God. You have my blessing! Swear no loyalty, My true-born gentlemen. To-night attend With horses at the half-sunk Abbey-door. There is great heart in me. Erskine We shall not fail. Scene IV —Holyrood; the vaults under the ruined Abbey Enter the Queen and Darnley Darnley What whiffs of air! The place is like a skull, A stony cap for draughts. Some ancient king Plays tick-and-touch with me. Zounds, it is jolly To feel the creeps o' Time. Queen There is an echo; Move quietly . . . wherefore do you gasp and sigh? Darnley I cannot get along; this broken pavement Keeps tripping me. So! We have passed the place Of the raw grave. Queen It swelled across my heart That he was yonder—David! Darnley My true servant, I shall regret him every day I live. Queen And with good cause. Speak low! Here is the issue, The moonlight, faithful Erskine. (To Erskine) To your croup, My squire! What heat there is about your face! Traquair, you give me courage. I am safe. Scene V —Dunbar; the great hall of the castle at dawn. Servants stirring about; some lighting a fire Enter Darnley Darnley Why how now, fellows, do you know your place? 1 Servant Have you some tidings of the queen? Despatch! 2 Servant Who is arrived? Darnley Arrived! The king—thank God! 1 Servant Is he below? Darnley He'll kick you down the stairs Unless you mend your manners. Get a fire. 3 Servant Who may this be, a muffled, slinking man? 1 Servant We doubt his purpose. (Mockingly) Save your majesty! How fares the queen? Darnley Out of my sight, you knaves! 2 Servant ’Tis growing light enough to track the course Of horsemen. Quench the torches. Darnley Let them be; It was the wild and streaky dawn that set My wits a-shaking. Will you bring me food? What, am I unsubstantial? They shall pay Who give me insult. 2 Servant Have good patience, sir; We wait the queen's arrival. Darnley Let her dawdle Till Ruthven overtake her: I am safe. To see her laugh and gossip on the croup Of Erskine's gelding! My good Naples courser Would not be kept her paces.—Look you, varlets— I hate their sneering eyes about my face— Get to the stable, groom my horse, for then You'll serve me humbly.—That last bit of travel, After the queen grew sluggish and I tore Alone across the stony country-side, What was it that encountered me, that shape Of straggling insolence that caught my reins, While the wind burst in laughter at my back, Coarse-lunged as these attendants? ’Tis not meet For royal persons to endure the air, Exposed to such temptations. How these creatures Peer at the doorways!—Pile the faggots up! I say I will have warmth! You, Blackadder, I know your hang-dog face. Where is Earl Bothwell? Cannot you speak? Blackadder He rode with certain lords, Huntly and Seton, Fleming, Livingstone, In the late starlight to receive the queen. Hark! There is bustle in the court below; You may espy their troop. Exeunt Servants Darnley (Looking out) No languor now! A lusty woman blushing like a bride Soon as that thick-limbed earl bends over her. I will crouch sulky by the fire and note What care she shows me. Enter Bothwell, leading in the Queen, accompanied by Erskine and other nobles Bothwell Safe, my sovereign, safe— Since in my custody. Queen Earl, at Dunbar I put all troubles from me; though a queen Without a country, I am gay at heart For sight of your true faces. Erskine, see How bright a blaze! Erskine Beseech you, madam, rest. Queen Ay, after breakfast. Had you met us, warden, Ere the last watch, our roistering company Had put you to your guard. The midnight faintness Wore off, and my young squire encouraged me So loyally, I could put all fear away, And prop my drooping head against his shoulder To watch the moon winning the adverse clouds To wear her colours. Sooth, we moralized . . . . Bothwell Well, rest you. Huntly And be bounteous of your smiles To faithful subjects. Bothwell We are soldiers all. Queen O Huntly, would I were myself a man To carry my own vengeance in my hand! I envy you your swords. Within a day This treason shall be flying fast to England, To France, to Spain . . . and if Elizabeth But listen to these calumnies— Erskine No need Of foreign princes. Queen Nay, my bonny captain, While there are hearts like yours. (To Bothwell) Beseech you, host, To give us breakfast. Bothwell If you be not dainty. We have no dishes. Oaten bread, and milk, Eggs—raw. Queen Then, Erskine, in your next campaign Boast that your queen herself set forth your meats. Good gentlemen, I have an appetite That will not bide delay: let me be cook, And I will quickly put you in such stomach To fight as shall regain my ravished kingdom. Do not be so amazed, or watch my face As I were not in earnest; spread the board. Still lost! And is it verily such art To pass from shell to broken shell the yolk, Nor mar the spheral yellow in the change? Erskine The marvel, madam, is the ministry Of those translucent hands. Queen The admiration That hinders you from service we disdain. You shall play courtier when we have a court, Meanwhile you rein our horse, and, at command, (Giving him a dish of eggs) Fry these upon the fire. Such sputtering dread Make havoc with our foes! I cannot rest With traitors in my palace. Bothwell In two days You shall wipe clean the rooms, if with their blood The surer cleansing. I will furnish you A body-guard, fierce men of Liddesdale, Full of the border virtue; while you rest From that mad, midnight gallop and its pains, An army will engird you silently. (The Queen approaches Darnley as she breaks an egg) Queen My husband, surely you will credit now I can afford protection? (To Lords) You would deem That I belied our consort if I told you That he forsook us in the mid-distress Of our too laboured journey. I, you see, Have something of the cares of motherhood, Which he who has occasioned them forgets. How do you, Henry? An uneasy brow Even in the ingle-nook? Darnley (Rising) I would be private. I am disesteemed, My Mary. Do you wish that we should lodge Together? None will credit I am king. Speak to them. Queen Nay, our host assigns our rank And disposition. Bothwell (To Servants) Give this gentleman A lodging in the north, beside my chamber. (To Darnley) I will convey you to your solitude, And then attend the queen. Exeunt Bothwell and Darnley Queen Now we will feast. (To Erskine, who offers to help her in cooking the eggs) Captain, I'd trust you with a thousand lives— Had I a thousand—not these housewife's toys. Were I but let alone I could do all things perfectly, the least, The greatest. Erskine, was not the young air Of ravishing, strong freshness? Oh, I feel This is the daybreak of my fortunes. Sit! Re-enter Bothwell So our good host will give us leave, I claim you Each as my guest. Ah, this is happy queenship! Eat, my strong soldiers! With a glorious rush We will retake our royalties. Bothwell (Rising) We pledge Triumphal entry into Holyrood; Health to the queen—God's grace that she is safe! (They drink) Queen My lords, ’tis very life to me to breathe Where no suspicion is. With openness I ever give my favours, fellowship To those of mating wisdom. . . . My dear servant, Whose office none can fill, shall be avenged: In ’midst of this hot grief ’twere hazardous To mingle retribution—punishment Shall be allotted presently: meanwhile We crave your patience with our erring husband, As with a man entangled in the toils Of evil counsellors; we condescend Ourself to pity him; and for our sake, Beseech you, eye his faults with lenience. Erskine (Starting up) Madam, Before my face . . . . Bothwell You are too young a witness. How say these noblemen? Huntly ’Tis not his murder Of Riccio that we stick at—the assault And hurt he did your majesty provoke us. A sneaking, vile poltroon! Bothwell My prisoner. Queen True, We both lie at your mercy. Bothwell Renegade! Huntly A royal pensioner—no king of ours. Bothwell He shall have justice at our hands. Queen If I Can hope to pardon, an imperilled mother, An injured wife, a broken-hearted friend, You can be dumb, till with my utmost patience I seek to make him sorry for the past. He is much spent. Myself will bear him food. Bothwell You shall not visit him. (To Erskine) Captain, your service; Diet Lord Darnley as his state requires. Huntly and Seton, Fleming, Livingstone, A hasty council must be held at noon; Our troops keep pouring in: until that hour, Madam, you must repose. There is a chamber Full, to the east, of sunshine and of sea, There will I lead you: not an anxious thought Should cloud your brows. Queen My lord, when you are near I feel my throne impregnable. Alas, My weariness comes over me, but simply As a tired child I shall just turn to rest, And think of sweet to-morrow. We have yet Our throne to climb, our unborn king to save: All, all is in your keeping. Bothwell Be content. Scene VI —Holyrood; the library. Lethington is discovered, leaning back on a couch, a small dog across his lap, in his hands “The First Buik of Rolland Amoreuse.” Lethington By the special providence of the love-god mine eyes have been turned aside from beholding ought but vanity. While the wicked devised mischief on their beds, my deepest solicitude hath been to remove the mockage from my auburn eyes, to extrude from them the keenness of the politician, the coolness of the cynic, the dancing valour of the wit, and to fill them with that lonesomeness of fasting desire that is mortal to women. [Reading] This incomparable princess of Albracca! I will dote on her perfections, till the Lord James look in on me; then—but The Manuel of Morall Vertewis is at hand (Turning over the books) Romance and theology— it is all one. The head, as the heart, hath its ferment, its aspirations, its disease. Tales of the nursery! yet I mock not at man's childishness. His imaginations affright him; the heavenly ministrants protect. Bairns must have bogles, though they dwell in their father's house. (Reading) Enter Mary Fleming Mary Fleming Mr. Secretary. Lethington Yes, Angelica. Mary Fleming You are so distraught, you do not even recollect my name. Lethington Divine one, I called you by your proper name, my angel. Mary Fleming I care not for your flatteries. Let me look into the history. Is it thus written? (Trying to snatch the book) Lethington I am reading, Angelica, of one in love, one who encountered a marvellous disdain. (Reading) Le bon Renaud— Mary Fleming Is that the name of your hero? Lethington You mistake; ’tis a lady who suffers this extremity of love—ebbed from roses to lilies in a day: you yourself, my sweet Fleming, look not paler on the instant. Mary Fleming You have been playing tricks with the story; you are like the good Renaud himself. Lethington Heaven forbid! yet he was a comely youth; auburn eyes, and, I doubt not, auburn hair that crept into the laces of his collar. Finding this delicate Adonis asleep one day by a fountain, it is written the lady was so ravished with his beauty she fell to sprinkling him with flowers. Imagine the dismay of the pauurette, when, despite her courteous salutation, he shook himself free of her dainty prickles, mounted his horse, and fled. Mary Fleming Le bon Renaud! Had she a visage so prodigious as to make him afraid? Lethington The freshness of a rose of the orchard. Mary Fleming Then you belie her. Lethington It is written, she kissed the very flowers ’gainst which he had slumbered, thus accosting them: (Reading) ô herbes verdoyantes! que vous estes heureuses d'auoir touché un visage si aggreable! Que je porte d'enuie à vostre felicité. ’Twas, sweet Fleming, her weakness to desire un beau garcon in marriage. The lad had yellowish hair and she worshipped him. Mary Fleming She was a fool. Lethington Nay, the fool saith in his heart there is no God. She would have fallen under the censure of good Mr. Knox; call her rather an idolator. Mary Fleming If it so please our “great god the Secretaire”—an idolator. (Curtseying low to him) Lethington Yet I would never have suffered the beautiful creature to pass away unsaluted. For it is written, on his awakening she made him a deep reverence. Mary Fleming Then you find not Angelica in fault; though like lady Venus she raved over her mortal, it was in his sleep, or at worst, after his departure. It is rumoured, Mr. Secretary, you are about to retire from the palace. Lethington If I presently ride away . . . . .? Mary Fleming Que je porte enuie à vostre félicité! For who would linger in Holyrood under the nose of the Lord James? Though he perch demure as a hooded falcon his dreams are of bloodied feathers. I fear me even now he is devising some ill to my mistress. But you—can you not rescue her? Did you know of this? I mean poor David's murder? Lethington Pretty one, None told me of it; knowledge, recollect, Must enter by the ear. Mary Fleming If I believed— Lethington You loved me, I would let these sovereigns run Amuck at their own ruin. Mary Fleming Do not think Of me; in sooth, it scarcely is a time For private thoughts. Lethington Yet the whole universe They say is swayed by love. Shall politicians Treat Cupid as an interloping god? He is my bosom-counsellor, and teaches My pen to rally Cecil on his rheum; For never, as I tell the minister, Do state-affairs so trouble me, but one, One of the four and twenty hours I give To merriment; for those that are in love Are ever set upon a merry pin. Mary Fleming Not if their lady scorn them. Lethington Pardon, sweet! For my romance instructs me that fair ladies Faint for our noble beauty—while at will We take them or we leave. Mary Fleming But does your heart Instruct you it is wise and chivalrous To leave the queen uncomforted? You love her? Lethington Ay, some day I shall haply die for her. Mary Fleming You are so dreamy. I will go away. Lethington Report me of the queen! Mary Fleming Am I your spy? Lethington Never, my girl; my own wits shall piece the evidence of my senses. How shall a man deal with rumour? ’Tis the question of the hour. Mary Fleming It were best you should not anger me—we are parting. Lethington Nay, if I leave you angry, I leave you to a long remorse. You will have no peace till the wronged exile's return. Mary, there is but one thing I trust in a woman, and that is the certainty of her unreason. She will give herself a month's penance for a moment's unkindness. So adieu, sweet Fleming, unsaluted. Exit Mary Fleming If I could give my sovereign liberty! She sent for me, and, lifting up her eyes, Put in them such a world of trust, I promised— We promise children the impossible— All should be well. A noise upon the stairs! Tumult, affright! Enter the Queen's Ladies distractedly Mary Seaton O, Mr. Secretary! We are in great amazement. Lethington What is this? Good gentlewomen—your discomfiture? Mary Seaton The queen is fled; ’tis rumoured to Dunbar; And the king's rooms are empty. There is noise The palace will be sacked. Lethington Fled to Dunbar! Take comfort, ladies; she is in the care Of loyal subjects. Mary Seaton But the earl is frenzied, And full of oaths. Lethington I will assuage his fears. Let me not see the Maries falling fast As apple-flowers in a late gale of May. Cheerly, sweet damsels! Ere the week be ended Your mistress will return. Lennox enters as the Ladies retire (To Lennox) My lord the earl! Lennox He saved his life and left me in the lurch; Curse the deserter, the unnatural, Ill-hearted son! He casts me to his foes As easily as an abandoned mistress Is thrown to raging kindred. Succour me, A father stripped of filial affection, An old, unrooted man, whose enemies Are closer than his child. Lethington Be calm, my lord, And all things cease to dance—most chiefly fear, Pale whirligig of our intelligence; Go you to Glasgow, wait until your springal Return to nature; he will fly his parent In vain; the stars wink, and my prophecy Is on the road betimes. Lennox The boy I cherished In every whim and appetite. Lethington Be certain, Good father, you will catch him at your side, If you go pray the weather-cock, an idol Set up in God's high places. Lennox Curse him! Enter Morton, Ruthven, and Moray Morton Ay, We curse him with mailed fingers. Exit Lennox That old traitor Is withered by a threat. Lethington Our chancellor Can make his glistening eyes as terrible As terrier's teeth. I marvel not, my lord, That Lennox is affrighted. Why, your anger Starts from you as a sweat. Morton No parrying now, No playing fast and loose. You own this flight Is of your provocation. Lethington Did you trust me With carriage of your business? For my part I had been well content that destiny Should muster slowly as Elijah's rain From hand-breadth cloud to blackened firmament. Morton You have no zeal, you never would have thrust Your hanger in that damned idolator. Lethington Well, for religion, I confess the trickle Of precious ointment adown Aaron's beard Attracts me; I discern a fascination, A charm about its unctuous descent. Man's worship as it furthers the accord And unity of nations touches me. (To Moray) Lord James, your honest brows are malcontent; When good men cloud I feel solicitude. The queen, ’tis said, is safe. Morton And we undone. She will disburthen Darnley of our treasons, As cunning as a whore. Our instrument!— You keep a polished smile—do you not hate him? The young deserter! Lethington Hate! With circumspection. Morton I hate him, but with all the pains of heaven And hell, with God's great rancour against sin, And with the petty fiends' malevolence. ’Tis the slipped victim rounds the lion's breast To his great, wailful bay. Maitland, I suffer, If I have cast desire upon a deed, Immeasurable pangs. Lethington No action yet Is possible. Take horse— Morton To banishment! Lethington To brood at Newcastle How best to undermine this arrogant And towering house of folly. Morton In my brain The bloodhounds are already on his trail. To think a female should unhug my grip Of heritage and spoil! That great Tantallon, Those stretching churchlands! Lethington Grudge not God his own Fair acreage! Morton But I wanton with the lands Of these fat priests; they are my buxom dames, Put to rank purpose by idolatry: No scruple of the conscience in their use; With them I ease my lust. Ruthven Shall we not fly? There is a draught. Can you not shut the door? It blows up that dark passage. Blood can freeze I tell you. Quick! To England. Morton (Shaking Ruthven off) You are fevered. (To Moray) Let's hold one thought in common in the dark. Moray, your policy? Moray I shall not budge. Lethington Faith, we must keep him stainless; he must proffer Our humble loves to the fair Amazon Now girding for the battle. Morton (To Moray) Since I go South to your empty lodgings by the Tweed, A bond betwixt us twain! I thought on you Mewed up in England, and the forfeitures Of your estates if Riccio's parliament Had looked upon your treason. ’Tis your time To prove your mettle. (To Lethington and Moray) Who first summons me Home to my honour shall not lack support In any private end. Moray I shall not fail Exeunt Morton and Ruthven (To Lethington) Your further counsel. I who treated her As something of a prisoner am exposed,— Or shall be, for already there is bruit Of a swift-mustering army at Dunbar,— To shattering reprisals; yet to flee Would argue guilt. Lethington Flight were insane in you, Since you are clear of fault. Let us despatch Straightway her faithful Melvil to the queen, Bearing a letter that professes you A dunce at these devices and offended At that which must offend her to the quick. Show yourself hurt, yet patient to endure Unjust suspicion; then abide her coming As confident and lowly as the just Await the day of judgment. Morals, Moray, Are your peculiar portion. See, my desk Is at your service. (Moray sits at the desk and writes. Lethington surveys him, pacing up and down) She will pardon him, And I, who with long-sighted constancy, And pliant diligence aspire to win A neighbouring crown for her, must be removed From her misliking eye. I shall retire Awhile with Athol. Moray (Rising with letter) This will tutor her. ACT II Scene I —Holyrood; a room in the palace, on a brilliant August morning Enter Darnley Darnley I Fall into disuse; behind me lies A ghost, a din of music; and before An army of afflictions with no aim But to descend on me. All fellowship Drops from my haunt and from the August days, That are grown old, immomentous, and dull. Good God, what will become of me! Enter the Queen From her I can command submission: if she gave As soft compliance in affairs of state As in my whims and pleasure it were well.— Sweet madam. Queen Henry, to this document Affix your signature. You truant boy, I have been asking vainly for the king From room to room. Darnley And I must sign this paper Whate'er it breed? Doubtless your Lethington, Though he seem banished, set it into shape. Queen He is forgiven, and now must be restored; But this is no state-measure—a request To Selkirk's sheriff and the Earl of Bothwell To make all ready for a noble hunt In Meggotsland. Dear, this conspiracy Is mine; its single purpose to unite Our severed lives, and give us sylvan days Of reckless happiness: we two together In the clear light will chase the stags, and then Rest, and make love, and rest beneath the trees. Will you not sign this letter? Darnley It is strange You find no office for me in concerns Of state necessity. I apprehend As well as you; in business show despatch: Yea, like the Spaniards, make one gallant charge, That would be fatal in its energy If long continued. To my cost I know That Moray is a traitor, but you smile And kiss me; I am certain Lethington Is full of guile, my serpent enemy; You lift your brows and kiss me. How I hate Your kisses! You forget all ancient wrongs, And each man has your ear—except your husband. Queen My prince's father! since our boy is born I think of you across such innocence, So sweet a favouring road, when I arrive My soul is full of grace. I recognise Your smiles, your dimples, the vexed way you vell Your eyelids in so dear a delegate Of your dread sovereignty that all offence Is washed from recollection. Darnley ’Tis in private You fawn on me. James is your minister, The Earl of Moray has your confidence. But I will have his life and rid myself Of your contempt. Faith, I can turn you pale And red, although you think I am a puppet, A king of rats and mice. Queen You do not threaten The Earl of Moray? Darnley For I will not live To see you wrecked by traitors. David knew The way to cozen you. Queen Unspeak that word— You shall not charge the dead. Darnley I will begone. Queen Return on your obedience to my feet. Now Henry Stuart, give yourself the lie, Confess your slander. Darnley You mistake my meaning; For David Riccio was a better man Than this vile, royal slip. Your testy humours Will drive me mad. Enter Moray Queen Now press your accusation. Darnley (With confusion) My lord, I have been moved to say and threaten, Through common rumour, things that otherwise I had not thought of. Moray (To the Queen) Mary, if my life Be taken from you, you will be deprived Of your one prop. Queen It is too true, and therefore I warn you of the malice in men's hearts. Had any given me warning there was plot ’Gainst David's life, he had not fallen a victim— You shall not. Leave us, Henry, if your shame Crave not an ampler pardon. Darnley I will keep Away from you; it is not a light matter To chide, and give dismissal to a king. Exit Darnley Queen My brother! Moray (Caressing her) ’Tis not fit that you should weep. The kingdom prospers. Recollect, my sister, I have the Stuart courage. . . . . Mr. Craig Presents a fresh petition from the kirk, If you can listen to it. Queen But your life— I cannot think of business, when my heart Is full of anxious care. Moray I cannot think Of any private danger, when religion May be advantaged by my constancy. You wax in all men's favour through your kindness To the true faith. Ah, were you in its pale! I have two jarring cares—a Romish sister, And God's elect. Come to the ante-room. Exeunt together Scene II —A house in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh Lethington and Elspeth Menteith Lethington Yes, Elspeth, ’tis the pleasure of my sovereign to visit me in private. To-day she will stream down to me in a vision. I am full of devoutness and elation; a king's favour is as dew upon the grass. Elspeth Is that scripture? Lethington A proverb—truth's worldly discretion tripping on the tongue; but, for your better contentment, know that it is written within the covers of the Holy Book. Elspeth I am too simple for controversy; I cannot answer you back, as the Lord when Satan tempted Him. Lethington Elspeth! Elspeth But I am glad the Earl of Moray is your friend. Lethington For he is of good understanding in the fear of the Lord—nay, sweet Elspeth, cloud not—it is the beginning of wisdom. Elspeth Do you think I may tarry till our sovereign appear? She is a royal lady. Lethington She is a distracting woman. What is to be done with that intolerable puppet, her husband? He moves about the glass-house of diplomacy with the violence of a bull. It must needs be that offences come, as the Highest foretold, but woe very naturally falls on that man who brings his swart wares to the light. Elspeth O brother, is this true religion? Dear Janet ever found you talked too smartly of God. Lethington I speak of Him familiarly as my Friend— with kindly criticism. Elspeth He will not suffer such irreverence. Mr. Knox . . . . Lethington He apprehends the Highest with the organs of hatred. He hath handled Divinity wellnigh as roughly as Dunfermline. What is left makes good stabling for the herd; the creature of delicate nurture cannot lodge there. Elspeth Yet you joined the Lords of the Congregation. It was Janet's comfort on her death-bed you would not serve idolatry. Lethington Serve! I am the servant of no man, save Time; I wait on his shiftiness with the patience of a lover. I flatter him, I defer to him: but, Elspeth, you have nursed your grandmother's dotage; is not childishness ever in the grasp of its attendant? Elspeth I am convinced you are an atheist. You make me most unhappy. Enter the Queen Lethington (Stooping and caressing Elspeth) Poor, pretty lass of the darkened conscience. (Looking up) What, yonder! It is my royal mistress who enters, as noiseless as the light and as welcome. (He kneels; Elspeth, with a low reverence, goes out) Queen A silver voice! Alack, good Lethington, Mine ears have been so dinned with ill-report Of those who spend their labour to defame And bring you to discredit, that I scarce Know how to reckon you. Lethington A rigorous judge To whatsoever mutinies against Your grace's honour. Servant to your rashness, The waywardness that mars your delicate And swift discernment? Slaves must minister In such unworthy offices; but when My queen is most herself, at her right hand, Breathing her pleasure, zealous in despatch, Painstaking in expedience, she will find Her sometime secretary, now her friend, And true, untitled servant. Queen Lethington, I live now but to pardon and make peace; I am a mother. Lethington May your favouring gift Breed amity a woman's silent way, And set us in the sun. Queen Could I accord The enmities betwixt my warring nobles, I were most happy. In my child-bed sickness I made it the sole pastime of my thoughts, By gifts, by reconciling offices, And frank partition of my gold and jewels To lull contending hearts. ’Mong my bequests, Your name, my Laird of Lethington, stands coupled With the Earl Bothwell's, since I reckon you— He for his valiance and rough honesty, You for your subtle, extricating sense— My two most weighty subjects . . . . and at war? Nay, for my sake, to pleasure me, the breach Must be closed up betwixt you. Lethington Haddington's Fairy nunnery severs us. Queen You must divide The apple of your discord. Lethington Madam, to divide the sweet cloister were to sever Christ's seamless robe. Let us not rend it; let it fall rather to my lot. But it is not, my sovereign lady, by grants of land, nor even by the twinned bounty of your gracious bequest that we can be accorded. Those on the right hand and the left in the parable are of opposed nature; and the office of the sovereign, so it please you, is to set a great gulf betwixt them. James Hepburn will make for your undoing and the enmity of England wherever he meddle; my lesson, in the lenient hours when you permit me to tutor you, hath been ever deference to Elizabeth. Queen ’Tis too palpable you woo England's queen. Lethington Not for her beauty. If for her possessions, we covet one object, her crown, and for one head. Boast of it in your dreams; but by day propitiate in patience. Were I not your true servant, I should scarcely dare to raise tempest on your brows by my monition. Queen The English crown! It is my dearest hope: I tell you, Lethington, one little hour I felt the sense of glory and expanse, The opening of my nature's very leaves. ’Twas on the day of the great tournament, After the peace of Cambray, when the king Trusted by aid of Spain to stablish me Sovereign and Catholic on English soil. I was but scarce sixteen. Oh, I remember I shook all sickness from me in the bliss Of my true dignity; the royal arms Of England and of Scotland, with the crown Of France above them, blazoned on my car. Place for the Queen, and when the populace Added of England, something changed in me, As when the sky first kindled into stars. Dreams should be sluggish, this encloses me, And eddies me away. I cannot rest Till I have crossed the Border; Halidon Must feel the pressure of my feet, the guns Of Berwick must salute me. Ah, the dream, To wrap you in its current! I confide To you the secrets that I dare not drop In my soul's ear—if you could understand! A cry for empire pierces up my heart As sharp as murdered blood, spilled on the ground, Presses for retribution. I receive The sighs I breathe; if I am left alone I catch across the vaults of ancestry Reverberating sounds. I do not urge My claims, a racial importunity Leaves me no peace until its suit be stayed. Does there not grow in kings a royal gift, Tradition of the conscience? Lethington Better use They make of time who let the travelled future Determine their day's destiny, than those Who give to ageing instinct and tradition, That ever stays at home, a dominance And derogating lure. My dearest queen, Seek not the crown of England as a toy. Be patient; set yourself to govern now Sole as Semiramis, and be remembered Hereafter, ’mong adoring men, a goddess And heavenly Aphrodite. Queen Still the dream! My Lethington, you are restored to all Your ancient honours, and are free to pluck Of any my possessions so you cease Contention with Lord Bothwell for these lands. Let me accord you; I will bring him down With the Lord James to-morrow; for I pine At the council-table for your lambent lips: Our politics have no celerity, Our embassies no state, our correspondence No grace and candour while our flower of wits Is absent from the court. Lethington There must be peace, Peace and goodwill when angels condescend To be the peacemakers. Queen I always was Too credent, and must marvel at myself Who love to listen to your eloquence And fell persuasion, till I half-forget This friend of Mary Stuart's is her foe's Beloved ambassador, is Cecil's hope, With Randolph has too frequent colloquy, And soothes Elizabeth—Oh, I forgive; It is my common office. Lethington Doubting queen! But rank me very traitor to my brows With those presageful eyes that look beyond The sin to the appeasement, and remit Still unconceived offences: such foredoomed, Inevitable grace must draw transgressors Repentant to itself. Queen There is a bond Betwixt us twain. Lethington A bond no tragedies Can snap. Queen Farewell. Lethington (Apart) To think there was a time I cared not if I never saw her face. Exit, conducting the Queen Scene III —Holyrood; a room overlooking one of the entrances to the courtyard Moray, Lethington, Argyle: on the table before them a letter Lethington (Taking up the letter) The Earl of Lennox to his sovereign. He threatens that his son will leave the realm. Huntly Threatens! Such departure were most seasonable. Lethington If the boat be leaky, and the start at the equinox, our best wishes were answered. Huntly Yet the queen could not speak to us when she came hither to impart her trouble. Lethington There was such a fit of weeping in the clouds, I entreated her to retire to her chamber. We must prosecute this business. Moray It is natural she should affect to be anxious to detain him. Lethington It is unnatural he should essay to depart— blessed beyond dreams by her clemency, honoured by her in his dishonour, reasoned with when he should be arrested. . . . . Moray Yet if there were anything serious in her conduct at which he blushed! The queen's indiscretion is not of a character to bear report. Her gestures and freedom. . . . Huntly But to leave her! and that splendid boy on her knees. Moray Well, we must question the king on this matter. These unconfirmed imaginations profit nothing. Lethington (To Moray) My lord, pursue the young monarch with your prayers; but by no means intercept him with your remonstrances. If heaven make straight for our goal, counter-action is impiety. Huntly We must deal gently with the queen. Lethington In her widowhood. (Rubbing his hands) I could drink to this crazy bark! May it be stuck round with barnacles, invaded by the undying worm! The solution, as ever, is to be looked for, as the pippin of an apple, at the core. But listen! I am incautious in my ecstasy. Gentlemen, there is noise in the courtyard—an arrival. Huntly A thick, deep voice. Good Lethington, look out. Lethington (At the casement) Into fairyland! For there stands our sovereign-mistress, a white wonder of beauty beneath the torches, and draws in her young prodigal with golden arms— Huntly Why do you pause? Lethington Because he pushes her, The brute—No, Huntly, put away your sword, She is secure and militant, a creature To hold the world in awe; he staggers back. Huntly He must be drunk. Lethington Now he is on again! Intolerable braggart, mow and mow, Can you not answer? Moray Let us hasten down To smooth this rebel humour. Lethington (Turning from the casement) She is gone! Huntly, one need not be a Catholic To bless this Lady Mary. Enter Queen Queen Dear my lords, We have to-night a truant at our doors, Who will by no means enter, till we yield To his enforcèd terms. As in a tale Of fairy, we must give impossible Commands, and look for such obedience as The elfin-wands enforce. I am ashamed To copy his rough manners; he insists My doughty councillors should leave the palace, Ere he will condescend to mount our stair. ’Tis late; I may not ask you to break up A loyal concourse summoned to mine aid; Yet I will pray you softly to adjourn Till morning when ourselves will make you judge Betwixt our warring royalties. Lethington Betwixt You and a thankless rebel. Moray Since my presence Offends him. . . . Queen ’Tis a mood one must not question; A private humour that in lesser place By wifely tenderness were cleared away. Is there a man among you dare confess He ne'er came home impatient to his wife? My Lethington, sweet-tempered bachelor, Prepares a bright-lipped negative. But you, Huntly,—and you? Moray Those whom the Lord hath joined We will not put asunder. May your meekness, Coupled with fear, remove his jealousy! Lethington (In a low voice to the Queen) O Dea certe! (Aloud) May your heavenly grace Confound his churlishness. We will retire. Exeunt (The Queen beckons from the window; in a few moments Darnley walks in sulkily: she throws herself at his feet) Queen Nay, do not speak to me; it is enough That you are come. What, put away to sea, My prince; what, wilfully embark for death, Leaving your own bright realm? Have you no treasure At home that you must seek the Golden Fleece, My wayward Jason? If indeed you should Desert me, faithless, if you should desert, Why, I might turn Medea; for there is All magic bound in me that womanhood Inherits, or makes rape of from the gods— All good and evil herbs. I need to cull No simples; closed in crystal prison-caves I guard strange alchemy. If I were wronged The fatal way—deserted—I would draw My spells from Hecate: the poisoned robe, The philtres that impoverish, the bright spectres That dance before a victim to his doom, Would all be mine; for I must be beloved,— The goddess breathes in me; and if denied My wedded lord, if he should once desert me, I will ride boldly through the world, enchant Its heroes, soften its great, reckless hearts, Engage on ventures of high hardihood, Visit strange lands and new—and at the last Win of admiring Jove consent to marry Achilles in Elysium. Darnley Do not mock me! I care not for your fondling; you shall learn Obedience to my government. You prate Of that same Colchian dame—she cut in pieces The brother who fled after her and threatened To part her from her love; she minced him up To collops: do you so with the Lord James, Or I will do it for you. Let me have The state you gave me when we first were married. Queen Oh never! You have forfeited your place Beside me on my throne; in every act Of kingship you have shown yourself a traitor, Dissolved my Parliament, imprisoned me, And, not to quicken into light your prime, Obliterated infamy, endeavoured To set yourself usurping in our stead; Touch not our royalties, or, if you touch, Kneel and adore them: ’tis to them you owe Your life, your pardon. Henry, think awhile What I have overlooked. The tender ties That knit us in our honeymoon, before Your mad ambition, are fast-knotted still. I made you knight, and by the accolade Of knighthood you are sworn to my defence, To loyalty, to truth. Ah, if your eyes Had not been fixed on the investiture You would have known there was no further honour Left for my distribution. Earl of Ross I think I belted you, and then you smiled; Your vow was to remain my chevalier, And at the word I gave my very soul Away—I cannot revocate the gift. If you should go to sea, I fear such pressure Of recollection, mingling with desire, Would work on me, I should put after you One day in a lone vessel. Promise me You will remain? Darnley With Moray, Lethington, Your circling Protestants? Queen I am so tired, I cannot reason with you. For to-night Will you not tarry with us? There are many Who hate you in the palace . . . . Darnley I can take My rights, although you make yourself so coy And condescending. Queen You are safe with me. Come to my room; you will not? Darnley As I please. Queen Why then, good-night. To-morrow we shall meet Before the lords; you shall recount to them Your fault or mine; if you have planned this voyage With just occasion, or set out to sea As any wanton runaway. Good-night. Exit Darnley St. Andrew, but I will not follow her, Nor ever do her bidding any more; At Jedburgh she shall hold her justice-courts Alone; her solitude will grow acute, And she will sue me to return to her. And yet she has such carriage when she sweeps Before me! and I cannot say what ails, If she should bring me to the council-room. (Listening) She has not put the traitors out of doors; They plot a storey off—I will retire, And rate her for transgressing my commands. Exit Scene IV —Jedburgh; a room in the Queen's lodging: Mary Seton, Mary Livingstone, and Mary Fleming at work. Mary Seton Is it not happy that our queen is restored to us? Since the Lord Darnley hath denied her his company, she is as fond and familiar as in her teens. Mary Fleming Or when, a widow of twenty, she took us in turn to be bed-fellows. And we watched her waking in the early light; it was more regal than a sunrise. Mary Livingstone As you repeated to the Lord Châtelar in your foolishness. But they were merry days, and our queen the queen of frolic. Then came the pretty stripling of Lennox—her Maries were clean out of credit; she required no service, but remained shut up in her chamber with her winsome cousin for warden. Mary Fleming She is terrible in love: no compromise betwixt ecstasy and death. She lay rigid on her bed for a day after the king, in presence of her nobles, first cleared her of fault, and then bade her contemptuously adieu. Mary Seton She has rallied quickly, though a fit of passion broke over her when she heard she must hold the justice-courts alone. Oh, that we could hear of the embarkation of this Sit-in-the-Sulks at Glasgow! No one regards him further than he is agreeable to the queen. Mary Livingstone But she, poor lady, still loves him. She will look out from the window at the birds, wheeling about the heavens, and fear they will have stormy passage. Exit Mary Seton Mary Fleming Why will you torment poor Seton with your tattling? When a woman sets her heart upon a woman she is inexorable in jealousy. Mary Livingstone Too true! Shall I suffer and be silent? Mary Fleming I am glad I have a lover of my own. Mary Livingstone You forget, I have a husband; but that mars not my constancy—a man needs so little of one's nature. It suffices him if one's complexion be fair. But there is not a balmy nook in one's soul undiscovered of her; she desists not from divining till she hath access to the honey-cells. I have had brave thoughts since she questioned me, and I will love her to my life's end. Re-enter Mary Seton; she resumes her embroidery Mary Fleming Well, I grant her incomparable in her blue Highland mantle. Mary Seton You mistake; in her red camlat, rayed with the broken pearl broidery. Enter the Queen Mary Fleming Fie, fie! and her crown somewhat rusted! But hither she comes in her passamented cramoisie. Mary Livingstone With her silks and chenille. (They rise to greet the Queen, and lead her to a canopied chair.) Mary Seton Dear Madam, you are wondrous patient in your stitchery. Queen I can take my sewing, Marie, into the council chamber, scarcely into the assize court. To-day there is a brief respite from official cares. . . . I must close the bud of this tulip with my silks. The work, you remember, is for the king. Mary Seton I marvel you have even this leisure. Queen A languor has crept over our courts. The aggrieved make no charges, and it is rumoured we must to-morrow to Hermitage, to my Lord Bothwell, for further material on which to execute justice. Mary Seton Methinks, Madam, you take your Lord Justicier's grievous sickness too light-heartedly. Queen My good warden! But it vexes me to think how he has blundered. I ordered him to Liddesdale to make a strong jail of his fortress, and lodge in its dungeons the offenders for whom my justice-course had been prepared. He left the castle slenderly attended, was cruelly assailed by strapping Elliot, and, when Robert of the Shaw brought him home senseless on a litter, was not permitted to pass the gates till he had promised life and liberty to the masterful garrison of miscreants. Mary Seton Think! He was wounded. Queen Yes, but was it not A reckless sortie that has set at large The lairds of Whitehaugh and of Mangerton, With sundry of the Armstrongs? I am here To break the strength of such, and find my powers And office ineffectual through his fault. Mary Fleming My sweet queen, you are growing rigorous As the Lord James. ’Tis these six busy days That have so hardened you. Queen Ay, every morning I have ta'en counsel with my tapestry— This brave, blue arras! Have you noted it? The judgment of King Solomon. How finely He extricated truth, beneath the clamour Of clinging, wild affections: sentence these, And guilt will blab you out the truth as free As fluent honesty. Mary Fleming The Border courts Had been a fair state-progress if the king Had not so waywardly forsaken you. At the mere hint of this my Lethington Comments with bitter tongue; the people marvel To see so wondrous, solitary, white A justice. Why, at Stirling you would sit, Peruse, and sort your jewels by the hour, Making such pretty presents and bequests As set us weeping. ’Tis the deep affront Of being thus abandoned . . . . Queen Marie, Marie, Your tongue runs to disorder, and must suffer A moment's durance. Rim this slip with gold, And work in silence. (Rises and walks apart) I am strangely sick To-night, and with that wanton loneliness And dizzy solitude that lengthen out The vacancy at bottom of my heart It may be even now that boy of mine, Cruel as Cupid's self, and capable As he of smiting inward, has ta'en flight For ever from my shores. He said to me It should be long, so long before I saw His face again; and all my humbleness But strengthened his resolve. My love, my love! (Returning to Mary Fleming) Ah, you have done your task, and gentle eyes Pardon my admonition. Mary Fleming Dearest queen, You tremble. Queen Haply I have caught disease From the close air and crowding of the courts; Or it may be the rancour that one leaves In human hearts, howe'er one govern them, Sets me in this despondency. Mary Fleming The ride To Hermitage will freshen you. I trust You will set forth to-morrow. Queen That must be As the Lord James determines; he directs Our every step. Mary Seton (Looking at the Queen's work) It is a pretty sleeve. Queen If it might give contentment! Every stitch Is a caress. Well, we must drop no tears Across the burnished broidery. Take your lute! Nay, give it me! If music is played soft At amorous, dusky hour,—why, poets say, It draws reluctant lovers to its course, As a lone, female dove with luring note, Draws her mate homeward on firm, open wings. (Sings) She was a royal lady born, Who loved a shepherd lad; To bring the smile into his face Was all the care she had. His murderers brought a bloody crook To shew her of their deed; She eyed it with a queenly eye, And leapt into the mead. And there she settled with the lambs, And felt their woolly fleece; It was their cry among the hills That brought her to her peace. And when at night she folded them, Outside the wattle-fold, She took her lute and sang to them To keep them from the cold. She was a happy innocent Whom men had sought to spite. Alack, no sovereign lady lives A life of such delight. For no one crossed her any more, Or sought to bend her will; She watched the ewes at lambing-time, And in the winter chill. And when her flock was scattered far One day beside the brook, They came and found that she bad died, Her arms about her crook. She had no memories to forget, Nor any sins to weep; O God, that I might be like her, And live among the sheep! Enter Lethington Is Lethington a listener? Lethington Almost wearied With your good brother's anxious colloquy, Who would in my executive be mate, I came, my gentle princess, to your door For such refreshing as your happy wit, Clouded with mildness, ofttimes doth bestow On your taxed servant! But, alack! the matter Of this rare song, the tears that break it off, Forbid me to find comfort in the voice, Or in the picture (Bending low to the Queen) though ’tis ravishing As museful Clio should forget her scrolls With Euterpe to passion on the flute. Why do you sicken thus of sovereignty, Who, capable and sole, can bind in one The jarred and restless factions of your realm? Queen Du Croc has been with me. Lethington And he reports The king still obdurate. To sulk at Glasgow— Believe me, he will find it sorry sport. Have but a little patience, like the man Your swerveless equity confesses you, And all will be amended. Queen You are gay, You soon will be a bridegroom. Lethington From a rose Though one may pluck a cluster-bud, one bows Before the air-impregning majesty Of the mid-fragrance with a lingering joy. My buoyancy is for no private hope, ’Tis simple exultation in your clear Supremacy, and excellent discretion. Be mirthful, dearest princess. Queen If amendment . . . . Lethington Verily, madam, if we look closely, the policy of God is ever directed toward amendment; one can discover in it nothing of a destructive cast. The eating of the apple was in all likelihood but partial, as Proserpina, for devouring a few seeds of the pomegranate, abode in hell, yet in consideration of the undevoured mesh of vermilion had leave to open half her nature to the light. All is not lost, though Lord Darnley devote himself to folly. Consider, fair governor, what is the office of justice with regard to folly. Does she water it with her tears? Queen I will not write to him; I will keep silence. Lethington For a love-ditty would but swell his presumption. Have confidence! Queen I will immediately to rest. Yes girls, you may carry me bedward. Do we travel to-morrow? Lethington Almost with the first sunbeam. (She gives him her hand.) Sheltering sleep Soothe these storm-swollen eyelids! Exeunt Queen and Mary Seton It becomes A simple, pious action to remove The worm at festering havoc ’mid the leaves Of this incomparable flower. My hand Is delicate in surgery. (To Mary Fleming as she passes out) Dear, good night. Scene V — Hermitage Castle; an upper room: Bothwell stretched on a couch. He turns, with closed eyes, to Paris. Bothwell The water seems to rustle round my head. Why should our stream move as in fresh attire— The silk hiss of a woman? Paris. It is not Hermitage Water rippling by your tower, But . . . wake, my lord! . . . the queen. Bothwell I cannot move, With all these hurts that kneel upon my frame, Nor rise to bid her welcome to my haunt. O red-cap Soulis, my predecessor once Within this fort—old witch, endow my bed, My sickness, with a strength of conjuration Satanic and delicious to her sex Who visits me—thus prostrate. Enter the Queen, Moray, and Lethington Gracious form, I cannot show allegiance; fates forbid That I should kneel to you, or bow beneath The proffer of your hand. You do me grace, And I receive it merely. Queen We forgive. How does our Lord Lieutenant? Moray, see, These bandages are wounds that in our service Were taken deep . . . But will the leech reprove, Boy, if your master talk with us? Paris No, madam, My lord is mending well. Queen Untoward Justicier, Your courage has deprived us of your counsel, Which in our need we seek. I pray you, Laird Of Lethington, prepare the questions weighty That hinder law, unanswered. (To Bothwell) For a while We must discourse of various things—your gashes, The exploit that entrenched them where they are, And of my savage ride. The unwarmed breeze Took influence from the earth, and smelt of moss Till it was sweet as keen; the moorland region Shone grey and swelling, stud on hilly stud, Like a gigantic shield; nor were there any Among us who could find a certain track To this sequestered castle. Bothwell Our strong winds, And unyoked, grassy uplands never served Such office as to-day—enamelling Your silver beauty thus. It is a sight Would sting death to revival. Queen My warm colour Is new-lit by our speed, so dangerous Your countryside is held, so dedicate To felon outrage. Lethington ’Tis a sorry tract On which to venture forth; one almost might As well put out to sea in ignorance Of compass, shoals, and weather-signs. My lord, Among these moors, these billows marked in turf, The queen was well-nigh lost. Queen You see this stain Along my habit . . . . Bothwell Ha, the bogs are deep— My neighbourhood has sullied you with mud; Shame on the black disloyalty! Queen We christened The stumbling-place Queen's Myre. Moray I understand That grave discourse will not afflict the earl; Is it not time for business? Queen Nay, the claims Of courteous gratitude are sparely paid Until we hear the tale of that brave day, Which wellnigh cost us our lieutenant. Moray, Fetch me a seat. (To Bothwell) Ah, look not selfaggrieved; You, who have slain our traitors, must not chafe Forbidden slighter service to ourself. (Aside) The weakness of his voice and hue, for all The muscle-corded arms, is piteous matter For any woman's heart. (Aloud) Your story first; Let deeds approve good counsel. Bothwell (Apart) Magic help me! Wild, local wizardry be on my speech! (Aloud) This fortalice was crowded as a prison With foresters and dalesmen, violent thieves Reserved for justice, when, eight days ago, Leaving my loutish servants far behind, I crossed yon wood of alders. Lethington Folly, folly! The subtle value of that everything Called life escapes attention. I had held My safety dearer. Queen Spendthrift gallantry, Adorable misdeed! Bothwell Among the stems And tangle of dusk branches, face to face, I met the outlaw Elliot—hereabouts Called John o' the Park—a shaggy man, who paused, And asked his life as if it were a coin I carried in my pocket. Merrily, For scorn will make us merry when we hate, I told him of my heart-felt satisfaction, If justice set him free. The snaky villain Slipped from his saddle down, and stole away Behind the brushwood: with a pistol shot I brought escape to earth, and from my horse Sprang to secure the prey. Another moment, And I had pinned him! but an unseen stump Must stretch me o'er its lumber in a fall That shattered sense. The miscreant from his brake Crawled forth and struck me, body, head, and hand, With three, vindictive blows that bit so fiercely They woke my spirit; and with such a vengeance As that we deal in dreams I plunged my dagger Twice through the craven breast: swoon overcame My rage, I lay in quietness blind as night's, When lifted by my vassals. Queen Oftentimes A page of Plutarch has more swept my heart Than has the valorous air which I have breathed This morning, like a bird: your story, earl, Eclipses both in prevalence. Continue! The man was straightway slain? Bothwell His body lay A mile off on a little, open hill. Queen Is there no more to hear? It was a fight Like those upon the famous sands of Troy, And ended scarcely otherwise—a cloud Came on the wounded hero as a god Saved him from death. Is there no more to hear? Bothwell Of combat nothing, of disaster still A trifle: when my bearers to the door Brought me, no soul would open, for the keep Was under capture of the bandits lately My prisoners, who refused with brutish mouths To let me have a resting-place until My servants, in my name, would swear that nothing Should hinder their departure or imperil Their forfeit lives. Moray So justice for this year Was mangled in these parts, vile Liddesdale Re-fortified with villains. Lethington True, I smelt Impolicy in hardihood. Queen (Rising) One act Of daring feeds a scantness in the land Ten penal judgments cannot. (Apart) How is this? He has my hand; his lips are free with it, As was October's climate on these steeps Awhile gone by. I do not recollect Intending such a favour. (Aloud) Is there not Legend of hidden terrors in a place So stern as this and desolate? Moray Time flies; One third part of the first hour of the two That we can spare for consultation passes. Shall we not put our questions? Queen Brother, wait! Mine is not answered. Bothwell From remotest years Has this great, silent country known of things That talismanic, dire, implacable, Have been conceived and done within these walls. Queen Ah, the streams sang so eerily, as if They knew but time-worn ballads. To my shame, I feel a strangeness here. The exercise Has stunned me with delight; my limbs are tired, My head asleep—only my heart is strong With effort in my side. Bothwell They say at noon The midnight elves are vigilant, as deeming The zenith sun broad Luna; in the light They weave unearthly bondages with chaunt That rings in destined ears. Queen Beseech you, lay Some food and wine within the ante-room. I cannot cope with law until refreshed, And trembling less from haste. Bothwell Go, Paris, set Our oldest bottles forth. Queen I will return. You must advise me quickly, for we ride To Jedburgh in full afternoon, so rough And pathless is our journey. We are glad To find you better, for believe the truth— That we are sorry for your hurts. Bothwell Ah, Madam, Fate struck me for this bliss. I am content To bleed, if you will come to me. Queen (Apart) O God, His glances pierce defence. I must not stay. (To Moray) Lead me to entertainment. (Apart) I am ill. Scene VI —Jedburgh; the Queen's Chamber. She lies straight on her bed in a trance. Moray and Lethington Lethington A crisis! You are rarely in at crises: Lord Moray finds they tax the stoutest nerves, Their mere approach dictates a change of air, A distance from their neighbourhood. Moray My friend, Face my position: the invidious chance That gave me access to all state and grandeur— Propinquity, no right—attaches blame And ill-surmise to every word or movement With which I wait on fortune. Oftentimes To be away is the sole cleanness I Can show to gaping libellers. Lethington You miss The fine attractions of uncertainty, Unless you wait upon her fluctuant face, A-wooing her in person. Moray ’Tis a service Too warm for me till now. (Going up to the bed) Is this a corpse? The lids are stony; in the opened mouth The air stays idle. Lethington Ah, poor sovereignty! A husband's little cruelties have brought her Thus subject unto death. It startled me When, like a snowdrift loosening from a wall, She slipped adown her horse into my arms. A heavy faint—such whiteness! Moray I had noticed But slight indisposition as she rode; It came on at the journey's end. Lethington The air Was dark and bitter when we reached the town; I caught a cold, a swimming rheum. For that I have to thank his Lordship of the Marshes, Whose wounds are quickly better, for they say He rides here from his den. Moray To find her gone. Lethington A mirror, hasten! From her cap take out That grouse's feather, which she blew upon, And tucked into the velvet rim to please Page Bastian who had found it. Bring it here. Quick! A fair image, and some breath would soften Its climate. Just a tremble on the plume, The edge where down is lightest. Moray Did you find A strange behaviour in her at the castle? Lethington He played to make her woman's sentiment Dance soft attendance on him. Moray And the lead Was taken; she was gracious and reserved, Stung and yet frightened. All this comes about Through hardness to God's word. I scarce may speak What I believe of her. Adultery. . . . Lethington Preposterous conclusion! They have been Indifferent and dissevered all the year; What you have lately seen within her manner Is but such stuff as turns all women poets When sons of Adam bleed. The root of this Her sickness is her sore fidelity To that young fool who daily injures her With taunts, neglect, and scandals. I have had A sobbing confidence that so it is. Moray And you believe her word? Then must you swallow That she and David, closeted for hours, Talked only correspondence, and the turns Of language in her letters. Lethington She had been An idiot to have circumscribed discourse To business, for her wit is fanciful, And of familiar charm. We watch for hours, And yet no stir. The noble creature shows A fine persistency in life; she seems Like one assaulted traitorously, and struck With evil from without. Moray It will be safe At last to make announcement of her death; Let the attendants come to lay her out, And I meanwhile will straighten her. Lethington Beware! Still the firm knot of life secures her features, In her expression there is unity; Have patience and observe. Moray It is important That you, her secretary, acquaint at once The foreign courts with her decease, and further With her entreaty that I take the rein Of government. Lethington That was a private prayer; I caught it not, a politic suggestion. Her son? She made a sisterly request You would befriend the lad. . . . I take your cue; But should this be a catalepsy? Moray No, Her sad physician prayed us not to hope She could revive. The Lord has smitten her! I am the queen's most near of kin, and stay To render her my cold, fraternal duty. Her face is rigid. Lethington Death has signed no bond About it; for more certainty, before I spread your tidings, I will fetch her leech To touch her and give verdict. Exit Moray The man-child Of James the Fifth! Through all these stubborn years What waiting and what triviality, Waiting with perfect faculties and power! A male—and without blemish. Margaret, dear My mother, soon thy contract shall be published, And the Guise offspring illegitimate. Stewards and lawful stewards!—I was born A king of as deep royalty as Christ: Now, Scotland, will I cast in thee such seeds As in their crescence will transform the land! The godly shall find refuge in the branches Which now are tender slips. From the beginning I knew that she must perish, as a lie Betwixt God's thumb and finger must be crushed; Therefore abode His pleasure. Though there seemed A moment when by gentle intervention . . . Heaven would not suffer the least spot to fall Across my conscience. (Going up to cupboard) There is goodly plate Within this cupboard, comfort that may swell My English gold, and rings . . her stones will tempt Elizabeth. If I can bribe her women! Where are her pearls? This cloth can be applied In gifts by which my precedence will shine. (The Queen wakes) Queen How far at ebb I feel, how deep withdrawn! Some one is moving slowly on a stage; Methinks if he should come and handle me, And stretch me for my burial, I should watch As a mere witness; yet there is a pain Beneath this solstice, for I long to speak. Come hither! Wherefore do you leave my side? How long ago I made request to you When I lay dying to hold fast my hand. Rub me a little. Moray Doth God give you speech? Be not deceived, good sister, you are far Beyond my ministry. Below they give The order for your funeral. Queen Is it so? ’Tis well! For, dearly as I love my life, I am content to die, so excellent Seems now God's every motion with my soul. Poor watcher, do I trouble you? Moray Prepare To look upon your Judge. You must not lie And smile as you were dying but in sport. Queen. I am so weak; God gives me leave to enter His kingdom softly as a little child. There are no thrones, no sceptres. But my breath Returns, not like a flicker, pressing deep Up from my heart. If you would give me wine. Moray I dare not. Queen Would it overcloud my brain? The dizziness returns; you are too fearful. Go, summon Huntly, Bothwell, Lethington; And fetch my women: death has granted me A little grace to bid a last farewell. Exit Moray What love is in my heart! God finds the sole, The royal use of love is clemency, Remittance, pardon: it should be enough. Re-enter Moray with Huntly and Lethington There is a golden light before my eyes That hinders me from seeing; pray for me, I have short time to live. Moray Then will we pray You be delivered from idolatry. Abjure your Popish errors. Queen I will die In my religion; ’tis the tempered way To heaven—one cannot change one's habitude. Let all men have free access to their God; ’Tis my desire for Protestants and those Of my own faith, so sweet is liberty. Put no enforcement on them. Moray You forget Straight is the narrow way. Queen From east and west They come who traverse it. Moray I shall not fail To rear the prince, your son, in sanctitude. Queen Who keeps the child? — Your number is not full. Where is the lord of Bothwell? Lethington He is riding Across the hills to see you. Queen So I rode, Through such a country as is that wherein Our vague dreams are enacted: I grew dizzy; And he has wounds. Moray You do appoint me regent, And guardian of your son? Queen Plague me no more To put my honours from me; you were ever For abdication—I shall die a queen. Huntly, the king has knowledge of my illness, And yet forbears? Have you no kindly words Of parting, James, my brother? Moray I await Your trust and testament. Queen To live in peace Is all the charge I lay on you. I heard A footstep. Is it Henry come at last To take my free forgiveness? Enter Bothwell Lethington He refuses Stoutly to come; you must not look for him. Queen I have a dying kiss I must deliver, A message to him. Moray Sister, give it me! Queen Nay, you would poison it. When we were lovers— Ah me, I hung on him as he lay sick— You strove to part us. Bothwell (Aside) Shall death ruin me Before my very eyes, and turn my kingdom To dust upon a bed? Prodigious loss! Whom could I serve but her? How could I breathe, My life's occasion gone, my forecast shrivelled, My dower of fortune! Queen Who will mind my babe? None answer me—then let them fetch my servants. (Bothwell kneels, and takes her hand) What, Hepburn? Will you lift my pillow up? So! let me lean on you. Bothwell You are not wrapt Warmly; your cheek is cold.(To the Lords) Bid Arnauld come. (To the Queen) I swear you will recover. (In a low voice) Dare you die? (To the Lords) The queen lacks tendance; I will be her leech, Till she have finer aid; fetch me her women— No moment to be lost. (To the Queen) Give me your lips To damp with wine, and swear that you will live; My queen, a token! Enter the Maries Queen Girls, take care of me, For if you keep me with you through this day I shall not die. Be comforted, my earl. ACT III Scene I —Craigmillar; the Queen, Mary Seton, and Margaret Carwood, walking together through the garden from the chapel Queen How sweet it is to breathe the air again, Though blue November mists it. Winter roses Blooming and fading! Mary, have you loved, My silent girl? Mary Seton I have but looked on love As the moon looks on day-spring those rare nights She sees a world her silver would make wan, And creeps, recluse, into the western haze, Full of unbosomed memories. Queen And I . . . (She sings) Ah, I, if I grew sweet to man, It was but as a rose that can No longer keep the sweet that beaves And swells among its fluttering leaves. The pressing fragrance would unclose The flower, and I became a rose, That, unimpeachable and fair, Planted an odour in the air. No art I used men's love to draw; I lived but by my being's law, As roses are by beaven designed To bring the boney to the wind. I found there is scant sun in spring; I found the blast a riving thing; And yet even ruined roses can No other than be sweet to man. Mary Seton Still faster tears! Why will you linger here, So tall ’mid the low bushes? Queen (Stooping over the rose-bushes) How I stood On tip-toe, and with prickled hands drew down The roses in the bower at Inchmahome! We were so happy ’neath the filbert-trees In the old, monkish garden. Mary Seton I remember The rows of boxwood hid us from each other; You struggled to get out into the sun, Transgressing the due limits. Queen I was free Those last few weeks before we went to France; I could be naughty at my pleasure then, The wrinkled faces smoothed to see my pranks, And I had no correction. Let me wander In reverie awhile. Margaret Carwood Alas, dear madam, We find you sad if you are solitary, And weeping oft, as now. Queen A common thing! What is there for a woman who takes thought, If once she look down on her lot, save tears, Strong floods of silent weeping. Leave me, girls, Leave me awhile. Exeunt Margaret Carwood and Mary Seton It was for courtesy I stooped and let Lord Bothwell kiss my hands, For sweet to me is love in human eyes, As daylight to the world. Through all my sickness My husband did not come; I was recovered When he at last made speed. He comes again To-day; I should be happy, for my babe Waits Holy Church's blessing. Yester eve I held him in my arms, and heard my voice Humming a cradle-song. Ah me, the tune— Guilty again! It was the very same My sweet French poet sang to bring the flush— He called it flush o' France—to my white cheek When we sailed north together. Memories All, all of love! I am grown weak again, And weep at the least thought. A robin trills Each morning at my casement, on the yew, And sets me sobbing; yet if now, even now, My lord would lean a little ’gainst my knee, Brushing his curls in the old, boyish way Against my fondling heart, it were enough To bring me back to kindness and desire. When first I saw him, he was messenger From Lady Lennox to my early dule: That night at Orleans, as I sat alone By lamplight, in the chill of widowhood, That pierced as penetrative flakes of snow, That bruise and then make stiff the pain, there bent Before me my boy-cousin, lovely-faced, Modest, and rose, with radiant, crested hair— One would have said that Cupid's arching wings Were met above his head; he was too young For other speech than what his glistening eyes Might give: with bashful worship he withdrew, And I, the unsealed packet in my hand, Took courage of the envoy. High of stature Even then, and such full prince in him!—his portrait Keeps its warm lodging in my breast; I doubt If e'er I can displace it. Enter Darnley surrounded by a leash of sporting dogs Margaret back? Henry! Darnley (Pointing at her with a drunken laugh) How wan a face, as thin and sallow As if you you were a good wife in the wynds, Suckling her puling bairn. I have left girls With fresher cheeks than these. Queen What brings you hither? If to confess, the list of your offences You may rehearse unchecked; though majesty, When the offence is vile, deals chastisement Without assize. Darnley Ho, ho, my dame, and would You care for my confession? You are proud, And might not laugh to hear the songs we sing At Ainslie's tavern: I could pipe you one Would put you to the blush. But come, wife, come— We wink at one another's slips. Be merry! You must not show high stomach to a king. Queen A king of what? O'er whom? Is it to seek An unknown empire you put out to sea; To wave your hand o'er despicable tribes, Where tyrants bluster and are terrible? A royal purpose! Sir, we are apprised That you continue every day from evil To worse: we therefore must combine to put Your honours from you, that in lower place You may but mingle with your mates, not carry High names and dignities along with you. Darnley You ask me as a private gentleman To my cub's christening? You deceive yourself; My spirit swells, and all magnificoes Are chary of their smiles. Strange horrors haunt Outside the wine-cup—Morton . . . someone's bones! I drink for very life, and have no mind To diddle at your shows. Queen You cannot mean You will be absent when at Feast of Kings We offer and present our true-born heir. So glorious a day! The noblest princes Of Christendom, through their ambassadors, Compass the font, the Pope himself desires A nuncio should be sped; I have half-drained My coffers in my joy: solemnities, Full of such quick succession and surprise As we shall now prepare, will keep their rank And lustre uneclipsed in sovereign minds When James shall be a man. Darnley James! Queen There have been Great Scottish monarchs of the name. My father . . . . Darnley There have been Scottish kings named David too; If David be your infant's father's name, Let it be his. Queen It grieves me to the heart The child should bear your likeness. We must rear him Wholly apart from you. Now quit my presence; I came here for the fresher air. Darnley Dum derra! Mistress, you go your way, and I go mine; The spinning world is big enough for two To ding their crowns and make a holiday . . . . Flowers at your bosom! Let me have a rose To wag at jesters. ’Pon my word, your lips Are set up coy, and I must have a kiss For bravery and fellowship. Come, woman, Are you a wife or maid to lift your shoulder Between our mouths? Queen Leave me. Darnley Gug, gug!—and wherefore, Until I have advantage? By St. Bride, I'll play the truant. Bessie laughs to hear How you fly out and spit. 'Tis tavern-talk That you are mortal jealous. Sweet-heart, come; We will not mope. Exit, caressing one of his dogs. Queen He must be put away, Fool, traitor, noxious reptile. What are these Sharp swords about my heart? No issue thence Of sighs and dolorous weeping; war and winter, Numb wretchedness, and fierce, constricting hate Huddle together. If I suddenly Could die! Ah, would to God that I were dead! I could wish to be dead! Too quick with life were the tears I shed, Too sweet for tears is the life I led; And, ah, too lonesome my marriage-bed! I could wish to be dead. Icould wish to be dead, For just a word that rings in my head; Too dear, too dear are the words he said, They must never be rememberèd. I could wish to be dead. I could wish to be dead: The wish to be loved is all mis-read, And to love, one learns when one is wed, Is to suffer bitter shame; instead I could wish to be dead. And yet death were too narrow! Enter Lethington, Bothwell, and Moray Lethington, I must return to France. Lethington Slip from your sphere! Not so, my lady Venus; we will chase The noisome meteor from the firmament, And, spell-bound, guard our passion for the stars. While you, matutinal in piety, Shunned not the perils of the autumn air, Your servants not less zealous in your service Than you in that of heaven, combined in close, Determined counsel. Will you let us speak Touching your husband? Queen ’Tis a heart-break to me To think he is my husband. Lethington Cast not forth Such strong, deep sighs. They sigh who wail the dead; Not those who have sharp matter of reproach Against the living. Justice, madam, whets Her sword. Queen Could I indeed be rid of him, It were a dearer cleansing than from sin, More liberating than to cast away Mortality, more blessed than to rise From misconception of disordered dream. But if it cannot be . . . . Bothwell What easier aim! Queen Without dishonour to my son? Bothwell Ay, surely; My father was divorced, yet I enjoy, Unblamed, his heritage. Queen (To Moray) James, you are silent; Your mind misgives? Lethington But if his godliness, Being a little staggered by our zeal, Appear unready, ’tis the wont of such: The man accustomed to the leisure ways Of Providence is apt to take offence At the trim worldling's nimble diligence. Bothwell (Standing close behind the Queen) Cannot you banish him? You know the means Of making the slow hours pass wearily To those that have offended you. Queen O earl, I banish to recall. Bothwell The chancellor Should now be back in favour. (Apart) God, I stumble, And blurt I know not what. Moray An apt appeal; With Morton here, we may, by the approval Of Parliament, draw judgment on the head Of the offender who hath twice detained Your grace in ward unlawfully. Lethington True, true! (Aside to Moray) We must be patient. Take a turn with me Across the tile-yard, ere her mood be ripe To pledge us Morton's pardon. They pace together. Queen (To Bothwell) Hepburn, still My cry is for a convent, where one feels The pleasantness of death, and every day Lives with him as a gentle monitor. I long to be alone, for there is sorrow One cannot put into one's prayers, nor drop In any human breast—half recollection, And half despair. My injuries are not For state-reform. It is a sulphur-wind About my modesty to hear of men Counting my wrongs, of arid Protestants Meting the measure of the chastisement That cannot be poured out. When love is wronged Hell opens at his feet; he must have space Uncircumscribed, another infinite, To map out his remorse. Bothwell (Aside) What would she do? She shakes me and incites.—How should it profit You should retire to France? Queen To mitigate The shame of ruling with a vacant seat Beside me, single, an unwidowed queen; To yield to Fate, and, lying in her breath Under her pressing bosom, to receive Strange aliments and help. You do not speak . . . . Bothwell I dare not. Queen Does it look so ill in me To crave for respite? (Turning, she catches the expression on his face and rises quickly) Hush, I will not urge Too vehement a prayer for liberty; There may be other means (Lethington and Moray approach) Is Morton lodged With so scant comfort you would have him back At once to his fat lands and revenues? Lethington Nay, madam, persons of your noble nature Should think him amply punished; he has scarce A hole to put his head into, a penny To buy a dinner. Queen (Wearily and half apart) There is none of them Guilty of venial error. Lethington He will give Wise counsel in this question of divorce; He is an able lawyer, and hath much Old rancour to repay. Queen Beseech you speak No more to me of this. Can you not see That we are sundered? ’Tis enough; henceforth No mention of my husband; he is dead, Cast from our royal mind and purposes, Forgotten, insignificant. Moray To-morrow We will remove to Holyrood. Queen Oh, why? Moray It is your birthday. Queen If these feasts were kept, And not wide, hollow gaps within the year, We should to-day be merry; for the king— Ye put it in my mind—is twenty-one. I gave him no good wishes; but my tears Are all for his amendment; he is young. I will within, and write to him. God heals Though he is slow in healing. Moray, come. Exeunt Queen and Moray, followed by Lethington Bothwell She stings me now to demon-jealousy With shifts and cunning—yet she dropt a word . . . . I hear the muster for some vast success Rise through my nature, arming as a tract Arms when the bale-fires hang upon the peels By Tarras and by Tweed. My energies Are wild and undirected, but aglow With concourse and with hope. This husband, this Mere cog upon the golden wheel of Fate That would fly round to seat me on a throne, And give me lips the loveliest that the world Has decked for kisses and co-equal joys— This Darnley shall be put away. (Re-enter Lethington, a bond in his hand, meeting Mary Fleming) How, —when, I cannot bring to thought; but the great moment That shatters him will feed my pulse with richness, An impetus of blood. Exit Lethington Well, Mary, well! (Looking after Bothwell) He must be cooler when I bid him sign; Among us we will guide the matter through, And keep the queen in languid innocence Since she will hear no question of divorce. Mary Fleming Your brows are clouded. Lethington Scruples, dear, scruples! There can be no clear-cut action in the world with this hesitancy at wrist. Mary Fleming One cannot know surely by divination whether an action be right or wrong. Lethington One may know by intuition whether a deed will profit. Do you not grieve for your mistress? Mary Fleming Why, she is most marvellously beloved! Lethington Well parried, young stateswoman, and of whom? Mary Fleming Of all but her enemies—and these are the religious. Lethington Who have scruples, so we return to our controversy; and scruples but cause men to do ill what they do; they cannot hinder ill-doing. Mary, why did you scruple to let me kiss you in the passage? Mary Fleming Why, the queen was looking. Lethington Looked she ever ill on lovers? I would have bussed you bonnily under her very eyes: they are russet now as a November twilight. I would fain enlighten them. Our great queen must be concerned with love—’tis her empire. Like the daughter of Jove she can forget her own grief in the joys of an amorous couple. We have need to divert her. Come, come; ’tis my hour of recreation. I have been plotting the deaths of princes; but I have caught wind of the abominable machinations of Dan Cupid for my wedding, and I must look into this conspiracy. Have you harboured any of these infamous malefactors? Mary Fleming My lord, most sorely against my will . . . Lethington Ah, you had scruples, but yet a maiden's delicate prompting to give protection to fugitives. Mary Fleming A troop indeed of vagabond wishes so tender . . . Lethington Of age, you thought no-one would have the heart to arrest them. They shall not be arrested. Confide this innocent troop to my keeping. They confess under torture to devising a plot for the possession of my person. Mary Fleming I swear that they meant you no ill. Lethington No ill—but a remedy for all ills—my death, which is rapidly approaching on the strides of frenzy. I am lunatic every instant of my leisure, and stark mad in my despatches. I must needs prate to Cecil of your kindness. You have put a wonderful elation into my nature. But as secretary, I am undone. Now (Drawing her to him) swear to me, a woman's sweet, silent way, swear that you will recover me. What— refuse the sweet lip-promise? ’tis the only oath I take of a woman. Mary Fleming Yet I will not make it on compulsion. Lethington Lest you might break it without remorse. O subtle casuistry! Kiss me once free-heartedly, and take these winter-roses in your cheeks to the queen. Mary Fleming Carnation is the Stuart flower. Lethington (Taking her cheeks between his bands and kissing them) Then your own by inheritance and fortune. Scene II —Stirling; Bothwell's private lodging. Lady Bothwell is seated reading. In a corner of the room Paris is folding up rich suits of clothing Lady Bothwell Ay, Paris, clear Away the litter. Paris Madam, but my lord Looked brave in his blue doublet. ’Twas the queen Made choice of it. Lady Bothwell The show is over now, The prince baptised a Catholic. Be careful, Nor let the moths consume that Spanish fur— Lay spices with it. Paris (Holding up a rich garment) This is gaudier stuff: If the dim, violet stitches were not blurred On this gold ground, my lord, I warrant me, Would not disdain to wear it at the court. They say ’tis Flemish work. Lady Bothwell Peace, peace, I wander From my good book—Legenda Aurea, this My warning comfort through these vanities. The sight of such fair clothing will recall The day of my own marriage, when the queen Herself attired me, sprinkling me with jewels Of her own gift. ’Tis scarce a year ago. Enter Bothwell Bothwell Jane, have you heard the latest stir at court? The good archbishop of St. Andrews, he Who gave us dispensation from the Pope Is now restored to power. . . . You have not kept Too carefully that paper? If ’tis lost The archbishop could divorce us on the ground We are too near of blood. Lady Bothwell There is grave reason, Ay, graver cause than consanguinity, Why we should separate. Your lewd behaviour . . . . Bothwell True, Jane, my conduct does deserve reproach, And from a wife so saint-like.—Sue me, sue me; Give me no mercy. I confess my guilt. Lady Bothwell But wherefore do you seek this separation? I know your passion for the queen—alack! I would not be the bar to your ambition; But she has still a husband of her own, Jealous, intractable, imperious. Add not unto her griefs; her enemies Have well-nigh overwhelmed her. Bothwell Darnley lies Sick of small-pox at Glasgow, and the queen Ere March may be a widow. Lady Bothwell Then heaven looks With pity on my sovereign. Bothwell It is shame To wrong a wife so gentle. Lady Bothwell I will lay The dispensation where by no man's hand It ever can be found. Thus honourably We can be parted; and, in honour, you, After such time as heaven has loosed her bond, Can take the queen. Bothwell It is a desperate scheme! How cold and yet how kindly are your eyes. I never hate you—her I often hate. Lady Bothwell Poor lady, for you love her! I have been More fortunate in winning your respect. You are a gallant fellow, but too wild For the great, fireside virtues. It is true, Despite the dispensation, we have never Been man and wife. Bothwell You have befriended me Unfailingly. Jane, you are deep within The counsels of the queen.—Does she incline: May I not hope to win her? Lady Bothwell For her sake I am unknitting, James, our marriage-bond; I shall not then report her. At your feet The gown of Spanish fur I recognise As her own mother's wear. She loved her mother She would not part with that except to one She trusted with a child's simplicity. Prove worthy of her faith. Bothwell She is capricious, Lenient, remorseful, in a breath. To-night With sudden pity for her ailing lord She starts for Callander. Lady Bothwell A faithful heart. James, of your loyalty they make great boast; It is not of my fibre who for her Resign my rank and office as a wife. Bothwell When I am king . . . . Lady Bothwell I shall be still her subject, My blessèd lady. Men would die for her— They say so. I, simply to smooth a crease Of her wide brows, would suffer any shame The good archbishop, or indeed yourself Could put me to. Let Huntly settle this Without my further meddling. I shall stay Awhile from town. You have a heavy stare And discontented: all is as you wish? Bothwell Have you no pain in leaving me? Lady Bothwell No pain In serving my dear mistress. Fare you well. I cannot yet divorce you from my prayers— You have few friends. I will depart this even, The writing on my person: ’twill be easy Hereafter to approve our marriage null. Farewell! God's blessing on you. Exit Bothwell Fie, this woman Leaves me with branded cheeks. To bid her pack; To break up house, to get myself divorced From one so noble and so tolerant Just for a giddy hope! (Summoning Paris) Ho, Paris, put This trumpery away (Kicking the Spanish fur.) I must to-morrow Betimes conduct the queen to Callander. Exit Paris The infamous, soft creature with her sighs, Her innocence and wonder!—she shall be A glorious fellow-sinner at my side, Shall give me love for love. I am no fool; I know we stand together on the brink Of uttermost perdition; but some joy She owes me. Why, a fiend to whom one sells One's soul gives earthly pleasure to excess In recompense, and I have simply signed A bond to be a denizen of hell For ever, for her sake. We will be platted Together, as the rose is with the briar O'er some fond lovers' tombs. How low the fire Has sunk! I am left stranded, with no comfort, Divorced and homeless,—till a palace-door Open, until I have that other wife Spotted with furs and gems; it turns my brain. Scene III —Whittingham; beneath the aged yew-tree; Lethington is discovered, leaning on one of the scaly, red boughs Lethington Ay, you big snow-clouds, pile your virulence Over the swarthy yew-tree. Let the white Be blackened, and the sooty swathed in snow; ’Tis the world's process of transfiguration, And thwarted issues. I am dolorous, sick, And savage, a pined bridegroom—married but On Twelfth Night, Feast of the Epiphany, And thrust from my sweet bride ere she had learnt Half the infinitude of that affection Reserved for conjugal unbosoming. I told my pretty lass I would create And then receive her happiness; ’tis plain Of all the parts of man I am most fitted To play the bridegroom: the slow dalliance suits The quietness of my nature; and to win My ends by love and sheer persistency Is to give favouring exit to the grace, The living fount within, that I attempt Vainly to dam. There is no brute in me; This Bothwell must contrive the bloody work Of which the apprehension turns me sick. I must acquaint my love of my bruised rest, My terrors and imaginings. (Jotting down a note) Sweet Mary, The omens are not auspicious. I fear thy bridegroom will come to an ill end. For last night in a dream I encountered, as it were, a mangled funeral. I saw the tressels and the staves, the peacock and the dog. The peacock would not look at me; but the dog paused as before some decayed matter. Dear, in my anguish at his snuffling, I struggled so violently that the vision broke. ’Tis the cradle of your warm breast that I lack. You alone can rescue me from these ill dreams. Yours, to deliver from the dogs, Lethington. To my breast, and to mingle there with much foul matter. How now! Yonder is Morton, parting with the castellan, a sunny bluster on his brow. (Enter Morton) My lord, you have a rosy face. Morton I have slept well in this air; it is my own. Lethington You mean your native air? Morton Mine, man, as the fish are in yonder stream. It fans my harvests: shall I own the wheatfields and not the breeze that bows them? It carries my feeding rains into the valley; it sweeps my hills. Lethington ’Twas the queen's bounty gave you Whittingham. Morton The queen gave it; she shall by no means take it back again with her other bounties when she reaches her twenty-fifth year. I enjoy a goodly heritage. When my paths drop fatness, I take it as a sign I am one of God's elect; a man with a lean patrimony is but a browsing goat. I feed among the green pastures: that reminds me whose I am. I have been lying fallow in the south; but, Maitland, my blank ground is not unsown; it bosoms a young crop. Ah, ah, my vengeance is lusty in me. Lethington But you must not blink With such an eager eye. This death-chill morning, And the grim velvets of the yew forebode:— Cheerless for conference; yet a colloquy I' the open air is safer than within. I have myself made search beneath the shadow Of the dark flats and found all tenantless. Morton But hold! where's Moray; he is one of us? Lethington Escaped from troubles, as the dove that fled The ark when beasts grew quarrelsome within; He will return anon, the twig of peace And innocency in his mouth: meanwhile I am enforced to break my honeymoon. My marriage-morning when our sovereign bowered My lady in the veil, a messenger Brought word of the king's sickness; of a sudden She softened, breaking as a wintry cloud To prophecy of April. Morton There was rumour Moray had tried with fireworks at the feast Of the ambassadors . . . Lethington To take him off By powder, and it failed. You see yon track Of frosty breath? (Pointing to Bothwell riding swiftly) It is our task to order, Being circumspect, the footsteps of a fool, To steer leviathan, And regulate the plunges of the whale. Moray is cautious; yonder is a man Who will confound a murder with a brawl. I leave you to give ear to his proposals; I can but nurture, others must conceive. (Peering at Bothwell through the boughs as he approaches) I could pray—pray—in my detestation of him, and I am at my very worst when I conceive a mind for prayer. ’Tis a summoning of the legions of angels the Holiest abjured. Yet to find incontinent a wish full in one's heart, a firm desire! I will give it shape: Heaven blast him! So, it is articulate, whizzed out into the air. Exit (Enter Bothwell) Morton This is mad riding in the frost—you steam. Bothwell The man is sick; it baffles me. God's blood, She left me on her way to him—I travel I know not whither; there is nought to do. Morton But for our present purpose, if the lad Be like to die . . . Bothwell She will recover him; I tell you she can lift up from the grave, Just stooping o'er one. Morton Well, if he recruit . . . Bothwell One cannot stick one's hanger in a man That's sick and dribbling. Were there but a field To win, a universe to harry—not This puling voice to stop! Morton Come, come! The deed, Though it seem paltry, may have fine effect. You would be king, and shall be, as reward For my good pardon purchased by your love. Compress yourself to rationality! You have the queen's own hand-writ? Bothwell God, her great, Committing glances. She pours forth the truth Fast as the sun his arrows. Bless the lass! For I would trail a pike to the world's end For love of her. (Re-enter Lethington) Lethington (To Bothwell) Good morrow, earl. Morton (To Lethington) You come With business on your face, and in your hand . . . Lethington A doubting, anxious letter from the queen; Her lord is mending and needs change of air, How say you, shall he lie at Kirk o' Fields, Since he mislikes Craigmillar? ’Tis a site Not much frequented, pleasant for the sick. Morton Has Balfour offered it? Lethington With free access To all our company. Bothwell This Kirk o' Fields, You say . . . I care not, so she carry him, Stretched on a litter, to the wilderness. Lethington But for the manner of the action? Morton Pick A quarrel with him, end him in a brawl. Bothwell I will not touch the leper. Lethington Tempt him out Into the country on a sunny day, And let the maskers wait upon his steps. Bothwell Let the earth swallow him! I do not need That you should lean your brows upon your arm To pencil me my plan. Some accident, Some loosening of the walls—for we can dig And burrow if the tenement be ours— Shall raise him up a mound: we will provide His burial; ask no question of his death! I will not face a tremulous, sick man. I am too superstitious. Morton Lethington, This lusty loyalist will be found a bridegroom After our princess' heart. Bothwell (Fiercely, to Lethington) Discredit me, Speak low to Cecil of my impudence, Hint to Elizabeth of my ambition To give her unblessed, sterile throne an heir. . . . Morton (Quickly drawing Bothwell away) What matter! Woo the woman afterward— Will they or nill they, in the end ’tis one. But look you, Bothwell, I am now at ease On my estates, and a hoarse gratitude To her who has re-seated me prevents My open share in your conspiracy, Unsanctioned by her warrant. Tell me now, You who are high in favour, how the cause Hath been advanced. Bothwell The true Evangel! Why, The prince, you know, was christened Catholic, And the queen wasted tears entreating me To hold the grease, the candle, and the salt. I will protest till she be Protestant; She shows faint opposition when I rave, A melting coldness. Morton The ambassadors Marked how she put you in the foremost rank. Bothwell Until she went to Glasgow. Now, I swear She dotes on his infectious malady. (They pass out, talking) Lethington To widow her! Does my policy involve a marriage? There is a certain dunness about my heart that disarms: I was witness of that hand-fasting at Hermitage—and there is a kind that goeth not out save by marriage; in peculiar, female cases espousal is a process of exorcism. Whew, whew! What a vast desire I have to whistle, to confide my shrewdness to the wind. (Re-enter Morton) Morton Heigh-ho! Where have your wits been? Kill a husband, and not be hot upon his wife! Do you think I have listened to English gossip for nothing? ’Tis in all people's mouths that Bothwell was king-consort at the christening. He will get this hand-writ. Lethington He will not. Unfold further. Morton He shall rise to his ruin step by step; we exalt him to a scaffold. Ere a twelve-month, I tell you, we shall have the government in the hands of men, foes of Papistry and friends of England. Come, Mr. Secretary, is not this the mark you shot at from the first? What has blanched you, man? ’Tis this damned, still air. Into the house! Let us eat and drink. (Standing by Lethington, and watching Bothwell riding across the plain.) Does his ambition vex you? He fares forth under the scowl of heaven, though he canter to his bridal. (Walking away, and looking back at Lethington) So, he will see him into the wood. Exit Lethington How I dislike the supernatural! How my appeal to it shames me! For to clamour there must be instant largesse. Fate accomplishes because she is deaf. Exit Scene IV —The Garden of Kirk o' Fields; night, with moon and stars. The Queen and Margaret Carwood. Queen Out to the stars, to the keen, midnight air, To cold, to purity! Margaret, my girl, These are gay, tuneful worlds above our head; One cannot hear their voices, ’tis too far, But they are singing blithe. This pretty group Of sisters in a knot, just seven—and Mars, That burns so at the heart! Ye festal heavens, I would be with you in your revelry. Margaret Lady, to me the stars are fixed and silent; I do not judge your way. Queen They reel and spin, Attract and spread repulsion. Margaret Recollect To-morrow night you spend at Holyrood, Howe'er the king constrain you. Queen Ay, to dance, To eddy through the air! I have been watching Two hours with restless limbs beside his bed: He slept, but held, importunate, my hand In his hot grasp. . . . I lay awhile unstirred, And must have dreamed, for it grew wonderful, Untramelled, soft; and Ronsard sang to me— You know the chanson?— La Lune est coustumiere De naistre tous les mois, Mais quand nostre lumiere Est esteinte une fois, Longuement sans veiller Il nous faut sommeiller. Tandis que viouns ores, Vn baiser donnez-moy. . . . (Enter to the back, unseen, Bothwell and Paris) Margaret Hush, lady, it is shame to face the heaven, Singing of love. Queen It breaks the loneliness. Donnez-m'en mille encores, Amour n'a point de loy: Enchanting music! Suddenly it jarred. I was beside my husband. Margaret Such a sigh! Can it be good to marry? Queen Excellent, You backward girl! A sa Diuinité Conuient l'infinité (Perceiving Paris) Jesu, how black a sight! Comes Paris as a masquer from my lord? Sooty as hell! How now, Sir Demon? we Would hold discourse with you. Exit Paris He is ashamed, And slinks into the shade. What is it, dear? Some triumph for your wedding, some device, And mocking entertainment? There has been Much whispering of late about the stairs. Margaret Fie, fie, it frightens. Bothwell (Apart) Does she rouse me up To batten on her beauty? The response To that frank singing toward the clouds is here. She shall caress me. I will trouble her, Until she fade and famish in desire. Queen Tandis que viuons ores, Vn baiser donnez-moy, I must instruct thee With what cold spells and sudden condescensions To keep Sebastian doting. Let us walk. (Passing with Margaret) Bothwell (Apart) It is all art and demonology; While fresh from out hell's smithy, for her sake I bid the devils colour my design, She wraps heaven's cloak about her, and becomes The firmer in her blameless sovereignty As she more guiltily incites. I hate her, And curse this slovenly and raw intent, This floundering pause, when free audacity Would bring our lips to meeting in a trice. Pass by, my lady Lucifer! Again, The amorous, icy voice! Queen (Re-passing) La langue chanteresse De vostre nom aimé . . . Margaret Madam, you draw Too near the windows. Queen With a wifely chaunt, A soft, assailing ode? Give me my freedom, My fancies for an hour. Who looks on us? Earl, you are closely wrapped. Bothwell (To Margaret) Your bridegroom, lass, Were jealous did he find you thus entwined. Give place; I would be private with the queen. Exit Margaret Carwood Queen (Faintly) It is the stars . . . . Bothwell Right, right; ’Tis destiny, Plotting above our heads. You note that sign? Queen A flaming comet? Bothwell The round crystal yonder Dropt from her sphere. Queen Astronomy and science Upon your tongue, my lord? Bothwell If you have learning, Your liegeman boasts some magic. Queen (Apart) Is he drunk? Nay, or he would not move me to this tremor, And sense of the chill dew.—A lamp above Is being shifted; I must hasten in. Conduct me. . . . Is this rudeness that you stand? Some memory folds you? Perhaps at Hermitage You have seen all these stars in a great sky, Like a dark moorland heaving overhead, That not a roof or tower has civilised. Bothwell Amour n'a point de loy: That polished Ronsard! ’Tis incredible He never dwelt ’mid screeching heather-wilds. Queen Ah, the gray grasses and the sudden bogs, The wind that is a lonely trumpeter, Blowing in triumph over loneliness! Believe me that I envy your abode Among the dales and breezes. Bothwell When you came To Hermitage . . . . Queen I could not stay my horse; We felt the pressure of our liberty In maddening speed. Bothwell For swifter entertainment Take ship on northern seas. By God, my life Has had its share of rough distress and danger Since first I went an exile from your realm: Prison, and storm, and enemies. Queen At last Your sovereign's love and trust. Bothwell Your hand as pledge. (Apart) Her flesh is beryl in the moonshine. Queen Yonder There is a plot beneath the ash-tree, both The ground and tree are whitened: there I'll tarry, And hear of some adventure on the moor Or sea-wave that befell you. I am caught With longing for romance and vagrancy, My nurse's cares have been so close and long. I would I were a gipsy-queen to-night, And from the brushwood looked upon the stars, A rover such as they. I love to breathe The ominous delight of these late hours; With you they are familiar. . . . To my mind You ever seemed the hero of some book Of long-lost chivalry. Perchance I vex you; My mood is wild, but careful of offence. Pardon my dream. Bothwell Speak on, speak on! Queen Well, listen! I thought I was to listen, but it seems My frowardness is wordy. As to dwellings: Crichton and Bothwell, Hermitage, Dunbar! The very names might well seduce to deeds Of formidable import; then, for change, Your journeys through the foam,—your loyal service Against outlandish brigands. . . . Is your wrist, Fierce Elliot broke, recovered? Bothwell Merely tender When I most need its sinews. Queen Still to babble— Now of yourself: you have a gait and face On which your occupations and your courage Are faithfully imprinted; I have seen A rock, thus obstinate, respond to weather, Its force and circumstance identified, Tho' opposites. Bothwell Say more. Queen When I have proved you A knight, an old-world champion by my praises, A man, while courts lack manhood? Bothwell This free evening Is worth all years of my unfriended course. My queen. Queen You crush my hand. . . . This starry sky Becomes almost unreal in the intense Stillness as I look up—the liquid spaces Between the stars, the liquid, twinkling stars! Let us go in. Those heights are tremulous, Faint to my eyes. It must be weariness, Or over-draughts of the full tide of air That flows up with the shadows. Bothwell As I live You shall not leave me yet, you cannot leave, Enchanted by dark things. Queen (Apart) He speaks the truth. An irritation dances in my frame That not a single woman of my troop Should rescue me, and yet these long-drawn moments, So quenchless and impossible, are sweet As wonders when they happen. (Aloud) You must talk; It is your turn, sir knight,—some rash adventure, Swift peril! Bothwell When I fled your anger last, My ship drove in on Lindisfarne. . . . To-night I have no memory; a fire of joy Casts smoke across old doings. Look at me, Not with those anxious, distant, queenly glances, Coming and going like the shooting stars; Give me the common, chestnut-coloured eyes You bend on Melvil, full of confidence, Serene and fearless. If you are beset By hypocrites and traitors, so am I; Misjudged, ill-favoured. Speak in this clear air; Speak to me—you were better. Queen More than once I have been forced to banish you. Ah, then It seems to me you had more happiness Than now I set you midmost of these false, Insurgent subjects. If I could escape, If I might leave my kingdom! Bothwell That great fortress You gave me, that impregnable Dunbar, Shall yield before I suffer you again To put the sea betwixt us. Queen ’Twas my mother . . . . Bothwell Made me the guardian of your unworn crown; Shall I not shield it now this golden hair Twines up and down the gems? It is this head, This living head I love. Re-enter Margaret Carwood Margaret Madam, your husband Complains he is deserted, and with bitter Persistence craves your company. Bothwell The queen Is worn with watching and has need of air; I will replace her. Exit Margaret Carwood Though I am no poet, I joy to leave you compassed by the stars, Lone on the grass that shines. Breathe freely, setting The reckless chansons to some border-tune. I will be faithful in my vigilance, Till the night-watch. Queen When I return. My lord, I were content upon an ocean-vessel To be adrift wherever fate might carry, Or whither Pleiads guided. Fare you well! (They part) A mad farewell! Bothwell (Singing at a distance) Amour n'a point de loy. Exit Queen My stateliness falls off; so natural It seems to hear the man's love in his voice, No more than the inevitable youth In the least movement of his lip and eye. I think that he was born to be my servant, And could I treat him with more confidence, He would not be forgetful of his place. The fault is mine; I tremble at his coming, I who have been his merry mate in war, And borne his soldier's praise without a blush In full sight of my army. ’Tis my weakness! I never shall grow holy among men, And yet I wish them ever good, not evil, And long to give them pleasure of such portion Of wit or beauty as were made my dower. My father sighed to hear I was a lass, And felt the land was doomed. There is a kingdom Meet for a woman's rule: Ave Maria, At thy Son's feet, on heaven's gold-burnished floor, How placidly thou kneelest for thy crown Of stars. O love! A sa diuinité Conuient l'infinité Scene V —Kirk o' Fields; the next night; the King's room. The Queen and Darnley; nobles playing cards at a distance Darnley Why should you leave me? Queen I have told you, dear; To trip a dance for Hymen's sake, and carry Bride Margaret to the bride-bed. Darnley I remember . . . Queen Ah, so do I—such pretty, blessèd hours, When you were Cupid's lofty bachelor, And I the captive queen he led in triumph. Now do not darken, for the shorn-off curls Will soon be up again, and soon your cheeks Will catch the tint that fled them. Darnley I am clear, I almost think, of blemish; in the glass There showed but few ill-marks. You must not watch me. I am so livid yet. Queen Come, come, this shame And coyness are of health; for ever springtide Is set on brave appearance. Darnley I have reason To covet in your face the lovely wholeness Of your complexion; we were once a pair Of world-unequalled persons. Queen Foolish boy, A few more patient days will mate our looks, Since hearts are come together. Darnley Let me hold Your sloping fingers still; I feel secure Only when you are close. Queen So apprehensive At Robert Stuart's tale! Alas, you know How meddlesome he is, and though he told you Of danger, when I questioned him, he looked Hot with his lying, and denied expressly All he had spoken. Darnley Bastard! With low mouth He dared to give the lie to me; my sword Will be a restless weapon at my side Till it drink satisfaction. Queen (Apart) O the future! My soul aches when I span his convalescence, And see him in the violent world again; Intolerable change!—I have your promise You will be gentle in your government, Since God has shown you mercy. Darnley Do you doubt me? My princess, I have almost died; disease Has made my old life ashes, and implanted A new life that's a yearning—when you bend Above me, then I know it is for you, To please you, win your smiles that like the sun Take lonesomeness away. O Marie, Marie, I have been such an outcast, I who have Youth's social sting in every pulse, whose actions Must need have eyes upon them to commend The doing . . . Queen Hush, we will not look afar From this kind present, or if memory struggle To bear her part in loving, let her bring, As in a rosy basket, all the flowers She swept up from our nuptials. Darnley Do not laugh, My Mary—but the poet you awaken In every man who sights you, made me turn Some stanzas in your praise . . about the turtle, And how she cannot weary for her mate More than I do for you who keep my heart, “My heart which shall be sure With service to the deed Unto that lady pure, The weal of womanhood.” Your tears! Queen It is such piteous exultation If I can please you, Henry, that it brims A little at my eyes. Darnley You must not weep, Lest they should say we quarrel. Let me fling A rainbow-laugh amid these showers. By Venus, I'll tell you how I closed my monody. “Yet no mirth till we meet, Shall cause me be content, But still my heart lament In sorrowful sighing sore, Till that time she's present Farewell, I say no more, Quoth King Henry Stuart.” When, pat!—I signed my name, they brought my meal, And I was doggish-weary, half-asleep. Is it not comic? I am bound to laugh, As you are, at the wantonness—ha, ha! Queen You have not been so merry a long while; ’Tis true that youth is joy, or is not youth! I see my handsome bridegroom once again, Now that the round lips chuckle. (Enter Bothwell) Ah, my lord, You find me a transgressor of my promise, Sworn out of love to lovers. Shall I slip Sebastian's revel? I would rather break Engagement with an envoy. Bothwell Lighted torches Await you on the steps; there yet is time To entertain an hour at Holyrood. Darnley But do not go! Bothwell (Apart) My God, what din they make Below us—fools! I must suppress their noise. (To the Queen) Not go! The couple would forswear your service After such sharp rebuff. Queen Your honest blame Stirs me to blush and hasten. (Kissing Darnley) Bothwell (Apart) Curse her favours! She yields him those surpassing lips that have Envasseled me, at distance from their breath; But yet she does not tremble: it is I Who give her body laws. Exit Queen What cruel fate That kisses, though they lock a treasured hour, Must afterwards unlock it! Loose my hand, Dear boy. Darnley O Mary, it is very strong, This beautiful, close hand, at which my life Drags for its safety. I must shut my eyes, And dash into my ruin if I loose . . . My heart bounds in affrightment. Queen I will come With early morrow; but for surer help And comfort take this ring of bright-eyed stones, Which I have warmed with use, and happily Turn you to slumber, while this Argus tarries To keep my watch about you. One last kiss! Darnley Your mouth revives me! Enter Bothwell Queen (To Bothwell) To the marriage! Come. Exeunt the Queen and Bothwell: the nobles rise up and follow them as a train Darnley ’Tis very lonely; the year-long alarm That has been madness to my forward youth, Driving its sap and fervour into violence Of desperation, seizes me to-night. I fly from my own body like a wild And shivering horse that leaves the vehicle, From which it broke, behind it on a road, While it careers through distance. She alone, My wife and queen, can hold this passion's head, And keep me still. Enter Darnley's page, Taylor In mounting have you heard A small and careful noise? Page ’Tis strange—there is No wind, and yet a windiness of sounds. I feel as when my mother told me tales Of murderers or of goblins o' the mine: Our house and all the pantries, as she sang, Grew restless to my listening ears, until I went to bed and slept. Darnley Then let us go; Shake up the pillows, Taylor. Why, the queen Is moving through the glitter of a dance Scarcely a half-mile off us. I believe We both are childish, thinking of the fields That lie beyond the garden. Let us sleep. (They lie down) (He repeats aloud) Cor meum conturbatum est in me: et formido mortis cecidit super me. Why did I choose that psalm and study it, To get it thus by rote? I have escaped The defamating grave by such an inch That now I tremble. What has moved my heart To measure life against the weights of death?— A woman's priceless, pale magnificence, Docile to each least claim, and sweet as weather That gems the boughs with florets. Die, go down ’Neath bloody stroke, or feel my breathing stolen By those I have betrayed—impossible, While she is counter to my punishment! Ha! There is subtle noise upon the floor; It terrifies attention, and its creak Tolls through my very bowels. Taylor, listen! Page What is it, sire? Darnley A little, dangerous sound. There! Do you hear it? Page Ay, it is a mouse; I see him sliding hitherward. Mew, mew! I'll out of bed, and chase it to its hole. Scene VI —Outside the Kirk o' Fields; Bothwell, Paris, Hay, and Hepburn Bothwell Hell! Must I wait on time to do my work, The unconcerned and common moments, mere Serfs of occasion?—stand with senses ready, Yet wait upon a match that will not burn As quick as hedge-snake moves her rings of skin, Though fire itself is circling up the splint? Curse my reliance on a tricksy force Not bound in this right arm! O weariness, That mounts to terror! Lads, I shall roar out Unless the noise begin. The very night Is but an ear, expecting what it knows Will burst from silence. Hepburn, the nine months I lay enwombed were shorter than these seconds That travail with explosion. Ha, ha, ha! The glow-worm has a firm shine in the tail; Have we a Jack-a-lanthorn in our service, Will-o'-the-Wisp, a lighted impotence, Lustless and unconducive? On my soul, The spark is out. Is there no window-pane Through which I could be spy on my tormentor, This slack, starved faggot? Paris Monsieur, round the house There's such a casement. Hepburn But the de'il himself, For all the frying that he gets below, Would scarcely put his head in through the place At this sweet time. Bothwell The air has grown congealed; ’Twill be incapable of prodigy If kept like this. I'll go. Hepburn You shall not. Hay Madness! My lord, be patient, or the king and you Will both fly up like witches. Bothwell Are you certain The flame caught? There is booming at my heart, As if the blood touched powder. I am mad, As all are who await results, and do not Whip their own actions to the goal. My project Is gone to sleep, like yon unbusied town With all the ashen hearths. I cannot choose But look to it—Halloo! The darkness cracks! The die is cast. (Kirk o' Fields is blown into the air) Paris (Falling flat on the ground) Alas, a thunderstorm In one affrighting clap. Monsieur, what is't? Bothwell Oft have I wrought great enterprises, never They struck me with a fear like this. The pit Of dun destruction gapes and all the noise Of torment makes acclaim about my ears. Hay, Hepburn, is it over? How the air Was tranquil it invades! I give my deed A voice, I hear it cry. Up, fellows, run! Quaking, you fools? It is accomplishment That shouts and triumphs. Hepburn, lend a torch! I see the stones, no bodies. Hay Crushed like rats, I warrant them. Hepburn Off, off! Bothwell The rocks have heard. Hepburn The people will not sleep. Bothwell Away, away! Exeunt in flight Scene VII —Holyrood; a misty, dismal morn: the Queen paces her bed-chamber distractedly Queen How the great theme has shattered me! The bride I put to bed is coy, reluctant, dull; I could not give her counsel as a wife— One who is disenchanted, tolerant, Gentle to imperception—who am still Aggressive and audacious in desire As any unsunned girl, and, since my marriage, I know not why, more full of reverie. She wearied so and vexed me that there was No mood in me to sleep; but, lying down In my loosed ruffles for a little rest, I dropped so sheer off into fantasy That I began i' the middle of a dream, Where I was dancing fast to give the tune To one who touched a deaf, worm-eaten lute,— Until there came a booming through the air; And then it seemed that we were thrown together, Stepping most blithely, and I turned to greet My sunny David—but the face was Bothwell's, And with a bitter shrieking I awoke. They said my baby had been laid to rest I' the dressing-room; it will remove my thoughts From all that happened at that bloody stair If I no longer face the tapestry Of Venus' bleeding Love. (Going to the cradle) How soft he sleeps, Scotland's small king—a lovely, lusty lad! And now he opes his eyes and smiles,—a sweet, Young, morning welcome. (Taking him up) As the blessed Queen, Although the sword has pierced her very heart, Can take her babe to sport upon her lap, And see him catch at cherries, we will laugh And love together till the angels come On tiptoe to espy us. Enter Mary Seton Mary, Mary! What terror strikes you? I have nearly dropped The child; there is a mortal agony About your lips and eyes. Deliver us Your message, and remember we are royal, We can give audience to calamities, And keep our state. Mary Seton Lady, the king, the king! Lord Bothwell comes. Enter Bothwell Bothwell With sudden, fearful news. (To Mary Seton) Take the young cub away. Exit Mary Seton with the child My queen, the heavens Have thought upon your wrongs, and by the shock Of earthquake, or by sulphurous thunderbolt Blasted the Kirk o' Fields. You are a widow. Queen The king is dead? Let me take thought awhile— My husband . . . Bothwell David Riccio's murderer Is lying in his night-shift on the ground. Queen How slain? Bothwell (Apart) The marble creature! But she caught Her breath; ’tis not all horror.—I was roused From my new rest by a great, breaking cry, Not of men's voices—as it seemed, a nightmare Of heavy earth that cried out in her sleep, Convulsed with struggle: then the roaring crowd Pressed up to me; I ran out in the streets, And found men swarming round what seemed the mouth Of an abyss, for ’mid the tumbled walls Few dared to pass: but I broke through the ring, And, groping wildly with my torch, half-stumbled Against a body, which the slanted light Showed lying scarless. Queen I had supped with him, But for remembrance of the bridal hour. Oh, horrible! he lies there as one murdered, (Pacing away and throwing open the door of the supper-room) Flung from his bed dishonoured. (Apart) Heaven has crept Into my ancient thoughts, and done the deed, I, David—I half-prompted in my prayers When I besought God's pity on your soul. I am a guilty woman. At the hour I learned the truth, that the king's missing sword Was found stuck deep in Riccio's breast, I nurtured A hope that waxed, almost as waxed the bones Of my young child, that he might be exposed To some vast ignominy and distress. Bothwell (Coming nearer) He lies, a heap, ’mid dislocated beams, And nether stanes cast sunward. Queen (Apart) I forgave him; Yet at my heart there was a reticence, A strange dissatisfaction. Bothwell You rejoice The elements have granted this divorce Without your stir? Queen I am more pitiful Than aught beside. I feel his jewelled hand That held mine at the altar. Bothwell (In a low mutter) Fire of hell! Talk not of trifles! I can see him lie, Just his white back, beyond the muddled heap Of stones, and mould, and rafters. Queen We are dazed. Hepburn, a death makes terrible, new knowledge For brains to hold. This stroke has overthrown All constancy of reason: I am blind. Yet, earl, there is no storm-cloud in the sky; A mist that drizzles, seeming innocent Of flame as old men's tears, mere wretchedness, Inept and with no rage. Bothwell True, true! Perchance It was some accident. Queen How? With what means? Bothwell Some stores of gunpowder are thereabouts; The clap was rather earth-born in its voice, Methought, than of the air. Queen It burst on slumber, As judgment on the dead. I seemed to hear It leap upon the hill-tops, gather breath, Then shout a zigzag ’larum—while a sickness Came o'er me as of earthquake, though the posts O' the bed stood rigid round me as I woke. My ears yet rumble. But I could not know The kernel of that uproar was a corpse, Which called me wife and dearest yester eve, A sick, close-clinging boy: this makes me shudder More than the hideous ground-swell. I have loved Its victim: God, who registered our troth, Can make good my affection; it was tried By wild devices on my husband's part, Repulse of the outgoings of my love, If I but leant his way. Oh, I am shaken To think of my late rancour and impatience, That found relief in a futurity Which was without him, brighter, unimpeded, And blank from his affronts. (She throws herself in a chair and covers her eyes, tearless) Bothwell She feels some guilt, Soon shall we be incorporate in the crime, This woman and myself. At Kirk o' Fields Our banns have just been published. Ha, the thump And mettle of my blood! (Aloud) He, who is stark Amid the shrubs, was by all sorts contemned, Contemned by the indifferent ’mong your subjects— A despicable husband. Queen In his eyes Last night a ruined youthfulness asked pity, His kiss had soft demands. For many weeks In disposition he has altered; humble And penitent he has been tossed from sleep To death. (Rising) My lord of Bothwell, I had rather Lose life and throne than that this cruel deed Should stay unpunished. Vengeance rigorous For God's grace and my comfort shall be dealt: By witnesses the fact shall be confronted, And have clear trial. Bothwell ’Tis impossible That anything but accident or bolt From out the sky is guilty. Queen Could I think so! My thoughts misgive me. Bothwell Fie, there is no treason Has ever wrought a pomp of such destruction As only comes by thunder. Enter Huntly Huntly Madam, madam, Words have been scared away. Queen And tears as well; Something is rolled against the gates of weeping. Huntly You press the bed-post. I shall send your Maries To nurse this sorrow. Bothwell (To Huntly) You and I will hasten To guard the spot, and see the body laid Within some private house. Huntly (To Bothwell) It was a mine That did the business. Queen Traitors among men, Not the mysterious sky! Their punishment Pertains then to my birthright as a queen. Make strict examination. (To Bothwell) You, my lord, Our flawless subject, think our crown dishonoured Until the authors of this factious mischief Be brought to law and judgment. Bothwell (Apart) She has looked Her old way at me, not a broken glance, But full and straight, a jasper seal of favour, With no complicity. (Aloud) Your will is law. Come, Huntly, I will join you in a moment, When I have had some drink. Exit Huntly (As he moves to the door) I never felt My courage cold like this, nor firmer too: I see no future but the shaken ground On which I march to kingship. Exit Enter the Maries Queen How I change! Tears soak my calm—a river with the ice Turning to river also. It is early. Light the fire: do not speak. I must lie down, And think of a great nothing. Is this grief? I shiver and am conscious of the light, As if ’twere yesterday begun again, And yet forgotten. Beg them in the house To make no noise; that is lord Bothwell's step, A sounding tread. Death sets such bitterness In conscience; ’tis his sting! My Maries, kiss me; Ye put my black dress on when I was married. We said his hair curled gallantly. Your mouths Make the past warm that haunts me as a ghost. Unwrap my sables. Mary Fleming Now the fire springs bright! ACT IV. Scene I —The Dule-Chamber in Edinburgh Castle; the Queen and Mary Livingstone Queen Put out the candles, let the sunshine in; Mine eyes ache in this painful, petty light. O Mary, there is spring-tide out of doors, The hawthorn-buds are breaking. I have glanced Down from my chamber casement on the moat Deep, deep below, and there was shining green, And turfy glimmer on the cold, grey rocks. It must be blithe without. Mary Livingstone Round Holyrood An angry people gathers. Dear my mistress, Let the black hangings canopy your bed As lowering thunder-clouds . . . Queen You cruel girl, Through the long, sombre record of the night Did we not kneel? Altho' I fear the touch Of the stone-tombs, did I make shortened prayer For his unhouselled soul? Was I not broken By the great dirge that rose for him? Mary Livingstone Ay, madam, The dawn was white about us when we left The Royal Chapel. You may put religion Aside, and study vengeance. Queen For the dead We will not cease to pray, and they shall never Be absent from our thoughts. Give me the air; I swoon again. It is captivity To breathe in this close darkness. (She faints) Mary Livingstone Let the light Flood in on her! Enter Lady Lethington and Mary Seton Mary Seton Alack, what little health My lady has! Lady Lethington She must have heard the cries. Mary Livingstone Unpack your gossip. Lady Lethington Girls, there is a cartel Set up, a wicked writing. Peace, she stirs. Mary Livingstone Stoop nearer. Mary Seton They have dared to name her name With Bothwell's and the lady of Buccleuch's. Queen (Opening her eyes) It is a dream. Yet tell me everything. You all look reticent. Mary Seton But you will fall Back into swoon for comfort. Queen Let me hear! I shall not build on faintness for my help; Rather on God, my Truth. Mary Seton In slanderous night You were writ up . . . Queen A murderess. Make my pillow, Now she has loosed the shutters. We shall need Time to prepare our nerve. How firm the city Holds to the land in sunlight! I am firm; I shall not slip back into faint or drowse, For anything they say within the street. Fetch me his miniature. Mary Livingstone The king's? Queen I laid it Beneath my psalter. Mary Livingstone Madam, here it is. (They gather round the Queen as she gazes at it) Queen His eyes are touchstones: I have thrown mine wide; They blench not from his portrait any more Than from his white, blind body. As I stood Below the feet, my grief was turned by death To stone of wonder: it was marvellous I saw what once embraced me, spoke my name, Wronged me, and wept me back. That awful hand— Impossible to think of!—wedded me; On that small piece of sculpture, once his mouth, I had expended kisses. . . . Then the past Grew void; I could not weep: Yet be my witnesses I meet his eyes. How dead you lie about me! Take the picture. You say the Earl of Bothwell is accused Of helping in this deed? Lady Lethington ’Tis said he wrought The very murder. Queen (Rising). Girls, there have been days On which the king, my husband, spoke such insult I could have plucked the sky down on his head: Lord Bothwell never hated him, no cause Of quarrel lay between them, no distrust, No memories, and no shame.—A throstle, hark! Sing, sing, keen bird! Oh, I forget myself; My anger is an impulse at my throat As piercing as your love!—Can punishment Take aim, when the Lord Admiral and I Are found in fault? I recollect the eve Of David Riccio's murder as a point From which my new suspicions dart on those Who hide behind detraction. What strange spell Is fixing me to gaze on Kirk o' Fields, On that black, hollow spot? The noon has altered; Close up the shutters. I have never seen A world so sullen . . . and you say my name Is on the Tolbooth? If I bend my ear I catch hoarse cries; I could not suffer hate; That buzzing frenzies me.—Of all this evil There is no fraction in my soul. It seems As if I stood amid a roaring crowd, Till to my deafened senses the vile tumult Seems to arise within. Am I a ghost To pace yon uninhabitable rooms, Where I put on my silver-broidered gown Hardly a week ago, and trimmed my hair The newest fashion, softly brushing it Clear from the temples? I must leave this haunt For Seton. Lady Lethington With Lord Bothwell? Queen He shall mind My boy; all people shall have knowledge how I rate their libel—the one, honest man, Who in his eagerness to do me service Almost waylays my thoughts. Argyle and Huntly, With Lethington, shall give me private escort To my deep country home, where I can live Retired, and watch the willows' glinting buds. I have a captive's instincts, and already Anticipate small pleasures with a passion Intemperately ardent. (Looking out) Who is that Rides hither from the High Street? Shame! The earl, Guarded by fifty men; his hand is moving Above his hilt. Close up the shutters—darkness! Scene II —Edinburgh; Moray's lodging: a meal laid on the table—Moray solemnly pacing up and down; he stops and looks toward St. Giles' Moray A godly city! Up and down the bruit Of murder spreads; they name her by her name, She is at last proclaimed. How I have watched The will of heaven, as a blank sentinel, Set on a tower before the lurid sky, Who keeps his station howsoe'er the clouds May burthen or discharge. I am exempt From any portion in this infamy; As David's son, restrained by Providence From bloody acts, that he with stainless hand Might rear the temple-walls, I am withdrawn From sight and warrant of unholy deeds, Which being done advance me and the cause Of Christ's religion. How I lean on Him, Feeling within a kingship sure as His, Founded on righteousness. Enter Lethington The time is near. Lethington What, wrapt in doubt, my lord! I little thought When we got rid of that untoward, young fool, There would be such excitement on his death. A fool is not so rare that one must miss him, And mourn his loss, and give him wild farewells, As ’twere impossible to find his like. Moray So royal a victim: but what gives me cause For gravest apprehension is the fact That the queen's name is touched with obloquy. The hand that flared along the palace-wall Hath penned the Tolbooth cartel: they are doomed— Adulterer and adulteress. Lethington Devilish lies! The queen acts in a noble childishness Of unsuspicion, ready to espouse Whoever is accused, since she herself, So rankly charged, is wholly without fault. At Seton now she wears her olden smile; It makes me happy that we widowed her To see her beauty peep again as gay As the young gorse when fire hath harried it; But while she freshens in the country wind The Canongate grows ribald. Moray It affirms The simple truth: my sister, Lethington,— I knew it at the hour of Riccio's death, And therefore stayed not my avenging hand— Is full of amorous charms and subtlety; And will not rest till she has brought her crown To shame with her idolatry and lust. Lethington Well, ’tis an aspect and a possible Solution of occurrents, though I own That I mislike it. The ambassador Will dine with us to-night? Moray Yes, Killigrew. Lethington Then we must play our parts. Moray I have desired Lord Bothwell's company; in entertainment He may declare his wickedness: we find In Scripture that the feast will oft expose Unguarded bosoms. The Lord Chancellor Makes up our number. Lethington As a merry five, Who know the merit in their purposes, Let's drink and talk as ’twere before the fall. You move uneasily. Moray I would be private ’Till the appointed hour. Lethington Yet look not black To very guiltiness! Exit Moray Truly, murder is like the small-pox; those infected, if they be of sound habit, may recover, and no blemish on their skin; others there are—it will be up hill down dale with their complexions to their lives' end. . . . My good compeer suffers religion to play duenna to his soul; her presence gives warrant to the offences ’tis her office to ignore. He spied Morton from the window. These two are confederate; there is the make of a ruler in either, and for my part John Knox's Monstrous Regiment of Women has my sanction. Women cannot govern, being under the dominion of a god. Melvil told her roundly it would be in her a gross oversight to marry a man full of all vices: she said she had no such thing in her mind, and came to me for illumination. I told Melvil to retire diligently before dinner, since we should all shortly be killed if Lord Bothwell had bruit of the business; and for her—I looked dreamily at the damask in her cheeks. She is devoted to destruction and she knows it not. Re-enter Moray with Morton Yet to be put to sea by Dan Cupid in a cockboat is no mean fate. The merchant-ship lades and unlades her cargo with care. Traffic and weariness! Perchance it were wiser to rock on the waves and sink. (Aloud) Well, gentlemen, the latest rumours? Morton We must stand by him, bear the matter through. The queen is branded fiercelier every hour, And every hour with fiercer lavishness Pours honours on the earl. Moray Hush, hush! His step. Lethington Not stealthy as a murderer's. Do not keep A visage so discordant. We must greet Our willing instruments. Enter Bothwell Good even, earl, An hour ago I crossed you unperceived, Mounting the Castle Hill. How well your looks Sustain your innocence! Calumniation Slinks in the rear at menace of your loud And angry voice; the blithe temerity Of your undaunted brow and liberal stride Themselves are witness to you. Bothwell We shall see At the assize, the queen shall promise me, Who will look blithe and who will hang the face. Old Lennox pesters her. Moray If you are cleared Of the aspersion . . . Bothwell If—what? Stand by me Or I will blab; I have the queen's own ear; The streets are filling with my retinue, And every hour my conscience drops a load. That marriage with Jane Gordon—she petitions For a divorce, and she shall have it too. Moray Peace! The ambassador! Enter Killegrew Most noble guest, You were more welcome were we not persuaded Your mistress' anger at a crime so strange And horrible that it confounds belief Speeds you to Scotland. Killegrew An incredible Calamity. Lethington It has transfixed us all. Two days and nights we doubted, charged the skies With brewing thunderbolts, uptore the earth, Found in its entrails no betraying store, And finally as men, baulked at all points, Betook ourselves to slander. Such invention There hath not been, such malice of hot minds, Since Adam first was tempted to assign His trespass to a lady. The result . . . Bothwell Humph! I will put to silence this abuse, This setting up of placards, tickets, bills Of defamation. I have found a cartel Reeking in red that names me murderer: By heaven, I'll give them taste of their own blood Who thus confront my eyes with effigies, And keep my ears a-simmer with the cry Of devil, witch . . . Moray Remember, gentlemen, My sister's honour. Killegrew There the point that touches My noble mistress; not for the world's wealth Would her pure breast conceive impiety Of any prince that breathes: hence she implores That were the man found guilty of this crime Her nearest friend . . . Bothwell We would convict him straight. I have myself o'erturned the blackened stones Of Kirk o' Field, and to the unsmirched corse Paid honourable rites. Moray Around our princess Were clustered her most faithful counsellors; No traitor in the camp. I left her thus, A month ago, being summoned to St. Andrews By my sore-travailling wife: while by her side, Assiduous to assuage, a messenger Burst in and turned my conjugal distress To fear and passion for the commonwealth. No clue, no clue, though I have passed my time Among the preachers, praying openly Of God both to reveal and to revenge. Morton ’Tis all conjecture; lacking evidence We must refrain from judgment. Bothwell I will clear My name, and quickly. Lethington (Apart to Moray) Would indeed we all Had bosoms as transparent.—Good our host, Methinks your dinner cools. Moray True, I have guests. Be seated friends. (To Killegrew) We are your mistress' servants In all, and to her health and to the blest Conjunction of these realms—we drink. A pledge! (They drink, except Bothwell) Morton (Apart to him) Drink to your blest conjunction. Lethington England holds Our choicest hopes, and our young church in her Must find a nursing-mother. (To Bothwell) Earl, we find Such comfort in your confidence to wipe Stain from your honour and that dearer name That is the treasure of our loyalty, We drink to your acquittal. Bothwell Ay, the queen! Couple my name with hers and I am blest. God love her! Gentlemen, he is a traitor Who harbours of the queen an evil thought. (They drink) Scene III —Seton; the great ball Mary Seton and Lady Lethington Mary Seton Methinks she grows each day more beautiful; There's change, and when I go to waken her, She is not lying dormant in her grace, But ready for me, leaning toward the window With her great, buoyant eyes; she has such talk Of stars above the city seen at dawn, Like flowers in blow, so round and luminous They are a joy to look on; and the birds Keep her alert from daybreak. Like a child, With a soft wildness in serenity, She lies, and I must love her. Lady Lethington Recollect, Among the daffodils of Inchmahome You found her perfect; she forgot too soon When the young robins died. I thought her hard. Mary Seton She was not hard to the rough city-cries; As often as they reached her she bent down, And sobbed through heaving shoulders. Lady Lethington She neglects Her broidery-frame for shooting at the butts; ’Tis ill advised. Mary Seton To take physicians' counsel? Lady Lethington But her dule! At Seton she discards her heavy veil, And glides, a shepherdess, among the trees, Her head so lightly covered that the wind Raises and drops her hair. It vexes me More than aught else to see her noblemen Gather together in a knot, while she Carelessly paces up and down the sward, With the Lord Bothwell as ambassador. Mary Seton He brings her tidings of the prince. Lady Lethington Ah, so; If you believe it. Enter the Queen and Bothwell They will cross the room. Seton, she lets him lead her by the hand. Queen This slander that is just hypocrisy At gossip with dame malice in the sun! Since you will have it so, an open trial! Let your accusers look upon your brow; They shall be summoned to the Tolbooth—there To meet you, happy that you are a man With sword to finger. When you are acquitted, The traitor who still doubts you in his heart Shall answer to your challenge, and myself By regal proclamation stamp you pure: For I have strangely felt about my heart The blight of sudden, outward blackness cast By winds, from who knows whence, upon my name. I must be merry, or the withering threads Would show among my hairs! This world of grass, The sappy buds, and of the luting birds . . . I run into the springtide for my trial; The dews and lights acquit me. Yet, my lord, The knowledge that another has been covered With like suspicion, one who will be strong To make men cry Not Guilty, is a pleasure Beyond the voice of earth which sanctions all That I can prove of innocence. Remember, We are companions, and you fight for me Slaying our accusation. Bothwell Gracious queen, I am unworthy . . . I can only stablish A point of law, an alibi. Queen Enough! What twisted minds will after that dispute Our foreignness to guilt. (To Mary Seton) Here, sweet, unpin My little hat of taffety. Bothwell (Apart) Amulets Are always small, yet work on fate and hell: That charm, that bit of black and feathered stuff, Amid the glints of hair, is masterful O'er sense and and reason—I could kiss the thing, And half possess the owner: such distraction Shoots from a trifle in a woman's dress, If she conjure it to be beautiful By what she is herself. That little hat! Queen I long to see you triumph! You must ride Straight down the High Street back to Holyrood, With flying banners. Is there anything Can give you warrant of my favour? See, This sleeve of my own stitching. Mary Seton Pardon, madam, You wrought it for the king: it was not worn. Queen. But he shall wear it who alone of all My subjects never quarrelled with my lord, But served him with a loyal constancy No variable humour could remit. (To Bothwell) Take this and cherish it as you have heard Its history. Bothwell It would not fit my wrist. Will you not broider me another sleeve, With Kiip Trest, my own motto, for device, So I be found by judgment of my peers, Worthy such wondrous, condescending love? Queen I will not wait their verdict. To my silks The first o'erclouded day! Farewell, my lord. Exit Bothwell Girls, you have stubborn brows, and, I must think, Sweethearts among the Tolbooth renegades; You stand as very elders of the kirk, So rigid and admonishing. Go, play Out in the sunshine; I will rest awhile: Give me the amber cushions. Exeunt Maries ’Tis for wrath I weep, for very wrath; such hardihood, And none conceive his stature! Ah, in all A man, how he evokes my womanhood! I have not dreamed so since I saw him first As captain of the Scottish Guard in France. How I remember!—for his hair and beard Were brown, of colour like a squirrel, brighter A little than his skin's deep-shadowed brown; And it was magic to me how his eyes Were grey with purple rims: my Maries then Could see no beauty in his resolute, Gashed brow, and hasty lips. I trusted him, And turned me over many a night to dream How he had dragged me from my enemies. Ah, then, what golden rills Of youth coursed through me, sudden bounties, gifts Of goodness, incommensurable joys That never had an issue. And to think The name I honoured in my childish thoughts, And wove my visions of . . . O monstrous world! Re-enter Lady Lethington Lady Lethington Madam, the earl your brother is arrived, And craves to speak with you—he stays without. (She ushers in Moray and retires) Moray My dearest sister. Queen You return at last! James, you have tarried cruelly in Fife, And left me helpless in a ring of foes Invisible. I know not who they are, Who thus entoil me in mysterious, Fresh hate: the principalities of hell It seems are loosed against me. You are come, I trust, to lay the storm of evil tongues, And speed the trial. Moray If there were a way . . . Queen Be bold. Moray I cannot. Yet if you were truly A Protestant—within the Bible leaves There is an awful word . . . Queen Such tenderness Is no wise to my mind. Since slander now Shrieks on the housetops, let the truth be spread From vantage as surpassing. Moray God Himself Averts his eyes from such iniquity As were exposed, if, with too pitiless A zeal to punish, we laid bare the facts. Queen Whom can they injure? Noble names are hurt In this unchecked suspicion: let me hear The worst you can disclose. You have a gaunt And hollow paleness, almost of the tint Of very guilt itself. Moray I suffer, Mary. It is incredible! Now God forgive My weakness that I cannot bear the truth. Queen Dismiss this speech of broken sentences, These peddling prayers that turn asquint to hell. Arraign yourself! If through your ancient hate To that poor, murdered boy, you could not brook To see in place of kingship, you so far Stooped as to mix in the conspiracy For his undoing, speak! Moray (Apart) A subtle Guise! Mary, I am not come here to condemn— Queen That is my office, when the criminal Hath made confession. Then you knew of this From the beginning? Do not lower your eyes; It was your way of vengeance for his fits Of pouting insolence, to get him strangled, My Henry, in his bed at Kirk o' Field? You had no pity—such a very boy! O vile—as your own origin! To think That I have called you brother, set you up As tutor to my youth . . . Moray I hold the keys Of life and death to you—take note of that! There is a ruin as of yawning hell In which I can engulf your paramour. Be patient! Cease from railing. You might hoot From your own palace windows—the reply Would be an execration. Mary Stuart, Look in your heart, or, if you will not, turn Your face and in that mirror recognize Your husband's murderer. The accomplices I will not question; to my heart it sticks That you are tottering underneath a load Of murderous guilt and lust so infinite . . . Queen Lust! Have you lost your senses? Moray So extreme I cannot extricate you, cannot hope To save you from the executioner, If you confide not your whole sin to me, And suffer me to arbitrate. Queen What sin? I know not any sin. I am distraught. Who are in league against me? Moray Do not fear That death by stoning that the church declares Your portion. If you heartily repent Your former life, desist from your affection For the Lord Bothwell— (The Queen makes an indignant movement) Stay, you will not do't, I know: therefore I must abandon you, I must retire, and learn in Italy That you have lost your kingdom.—Do not move! I know your madness and persistency. The time is come that I must give you up To Satan for a season; while in peace I spend my exile. Queen James, you frighten me. Has Knox been dinning this into your brain? Stay with me, let me understand. Protect The earl—he is most innocent. Moray Alas, You dare not plead I should extend protection To your fair, ruined head. Queen You must not go. Moray Will you not suffer it? Must I remain To have my blood shed in the open streets? Lord Bothwell sets a price upon my life. Queen He has a violent temper. You must go; But—then what is to follow? Moray Kiss me, Mary; For all my life I would not have you guess The wild work of the morrow. Fare you well. Scene IV —Holyrood; by a window of the palace. The Queen and Lady Lethington Lady Lethington The space is over-packed with life—heads, heads, And further heads: while everywhere, like stalks Lifting proud flowers, the horses raise their men Gaily above the citizens. These vassals Of Hepburn have fine seat. The Douglas banner Is coming forward; there is Morton's hat A-peek above his eyes. The fussy sunshine Makes Bothwell's trial seem a great event. Queen To clear one's name is signal and of gist More grave than other actions. Think of it! Lord Lennox, the accuser, is ashamed To show his face, and speak his proofless charges, Yet would delay his victim's just acquittal From world-estranging slander. This live noon Is almost welcome as if I myself Were coming out of cloud. Lady Lethington There is a sway Of faces toward the courtyard. Queen Ah, to shine Clear as the light before those Argus-eyes, That zealous crowd! Lady Lethington Earl Bothwell! Queen He is laughing, And yet he is not—’tis so quickly gone: His carriage is defiant, though he bends As if to justice that's invisible. Who rides alongside? Morton! Lady Lethington With the grin Of some heraldic lion; a golden man, Complexioned like his hoards. Queen And on the left Who rides behind? Lady Lethington It is my husband, madam. How cross his lips! He had a weary night, And took no breakfast. He shall throw me favours: To-day he kissed me inattentively The first time since our marriage. (She waves) He is riding As if asleep. But, see, Lord Bothwell looks. Queen His sovereign's hand shall greet him (She waves) (Apart) How his joy Shot up like a first flame when it ignites. (To Lady Lethington) The earl is strangely altered—pale, across His brow a sullen mark. Lady Lethington It is the scar He got in youth when recklessly he stole The English gold; and sometimes agitation Will make such hurts flare red. Queen Within an hour A page shall seek the Tolbooth and bring news How justice prospers.—What triumphant noon! Scene V —The Hall of Seton Castle Enter Morton and Bothwell Morton Where have you been, my lord? Bothwell A walk. The air In country places helps me to make plain My meshed and beating project to myself. Morton Last night I hardly slept at all, so joyous Was Ainslie's wine within me. We are pledged, By our rare tavern-fellowship, the greeting We gave to your acquittal, the attention With which your high proposals met our ear, Across the cups and bounty of your feast, To back you as the husband, for the queen, Of our best, native choice: but you must play The forthright wooer. Bothwell Ho! I need no lesson In woman-winning. Morton Have you yet come near Your proposition to her? Bothwell She has been At mass this Sunday or in company; Our elemental question to the sex Forms not except in private. Morton (Glancing down a passage) Man, she comes. I meet her not too frequently; her eyes Grow crystal points in scrutiny of one Long absent from the court. Exit Bothwell I have a fear Before her, a firm seizure of my speech, That dams up fate and passion. She is won— Not as was Anna Throndssön, nor my dame, Jane Gordon, nor the buxom waiting-girl, Delighted Bessie Crawford: these were thrown By my mere, single energy; it takes Ancestral forces, bone-bred vehemence, To compass what my fathers lusted for In fiery years ago. Enter the Queen Queen Help me, my lord; I am in doubt and pain: all day my guards Have had ill-brows about me. Yonder sky Of wind and darkness cannot match the looks These arquebusiers venture. On my word, I am defenceless if they mutiny, Save for your valour, Hepburn. Bothwell Hark! Their growls! Madam, the varlets come. Rest tremorless, I will obstruct this insolence. Enter Arquebusiers 1st Arquebusier We need; Give us our pay. 2nd Arquebusier Or we will use our weapons To do offence. 3rd Arquebusier Money! Our silver pay! Bothwell (Seizing the ring-leader) Choke down your greed, you villain! Pay and hire! You dun a lovely majesty as if She held the common purse. A beggar, clipt By fortune of all gear, would have a sense Less ribald than you show. Advance one step— All shall be hanged as traitors, and the boughs Swing heavier favours than their leaves above The daylit ground to-morrow. Queen Do they lack, And feel the nip of that which is to us A winter—empty pockets? They shall have Two florins each, the utmost a crowned lady Can find within her coffers. Bothwell Do you hear? No jolting me, no rescue of this rogue, Your frothy leader, till I let him free, His wind-pipe swollen. Your queen is merciful, And honours you with silver, who deserve Cord for your noise. 2nd Arquebusier Down with the payment then. No promises! Queen It is with grievous sorrow We take in such distrust. Bothwell Hence, quit the room. The chancellor will give you audience duly At eight o'clock. Why, why! I say begone! And when I say it, go! 2nd Arquebusier The bully! Bothwell (Loosening the leader's throat with a shake) March, With inclination to the graciousness That spares to trounce your swerving. Out, I say, And to your places! Exeunt Arquebusiers They have vanished.—Oh, You flutter like a star through widow'd black, That night-hood round the pallor of your face! You had been undefended in this strait, Except for my bluff service. Queen Which we thank. Such rancour in my household was disclosed So suddenly it shook me. Bothwell My loved queen, The men you rule are heady as the blasts That veer about our hills, and weariness Of colour in your beauty testifies The hard pitch of your toil. Take thought how far A close devotion manly at your side Would comfort and disburthen you, a love Obedient and executive,—as always Your general is the actor of your wrath When deeds to do must be unwomanlike. (Apart) She doth not flush; the crystals in her cheek Are growing sharp and brilliant.—All the land Sighs at your lonesome task; your nobles join To urge you to more livelihood of health Than moping labour brings you. . . . There is none To whom you have more lent in condescension, More trusted with those offices that irk The English foe than— (Suddenly throwing himself before her) I confess the fact; I love you with a man's love, deep as hell, Wild as the sea's for earth. My life has been Spent under hatred, solitude, misfortune, But ever with a singleness of hope To serve you in the highest. Queen (Distractedly) I am struck, As if the roof had fallen. Bothwell What, you can wonder That men should throw whole years of loyalty Beneath your feet as trash, you masterpiece Of world's enchantment; who in gait and speech Are lovelier than the beauties of old praise; Your steps surpass their kisses, and your voice Makes their best glance unwished for. Queen Are you mad? Well may you kneel: my other noblemen Have trespassed out of hatred, or at least Indifference to my reign. I have not found The insult of base love in any one, Save you alone. I am a widow, scarce Of two month's dule, a murder's remnant—you, A man but nine months married to a lady I first bespoke as friend. How dare you rouse The Bruce within me, the untempered fire Of king on king I carry to the grave In pledge of my descent? Henceforth, be sure, You are an exile from my confidence. Banished again! What reason do I find In Arran's frenzy, which accused your faith As liegeman to your princess! Self-condemned, You may not hope for mercy from my doubt. (Apart) How still he is, how still!—We do not need Your convoy or attendance as we journey Through Lothian on the morrow. To remain Even where you are displeases us. Goodnight. Exit by inside door (Bothwell rises and stands straight up without the least motion) Bothwell This woman! Somewhere she has pledged my soul; We have drunk wine together on some bare, Brown hill of chaos, while the wanton lights, Young meteors flaming lawless through the heaven, Peered at our rampant revel. We were one Before the stars were broken to their spheres; Part of the huge, unsevered element When day and darkness hugged. I know that far Below the rise of rivers, underneath The sowing of the mine's unfathomed seed, There was this sunken bond. She flings me now Contempt, my lass, my lass! What should we find In woman but the lavish side of God, Before the thought of judgment crippled Him, When He was soft, creative, fostering, free? Contempt, contempt! Night's stinging moments spin, And stir me to an act: the regicides With their dismaying weapons shall have done By far less intimate irreverence On majesty than I in person dare. Hell will be puzzled what to do with such As I shall show myself, it has no code That can entangle me, no quarter builded That might immure my unimagined courage, No flames to equal mine. The royal witch, She sought to disenchant me in the guise Of formal coldness, she the beauty, she The madding, unfoiled beauty. How the air Dreads me, I breathe on lion-like! She has said She needs no convoy! I will furnish one: She must with me the merry, downward way, Where demons cackle. I will meet my bride At Foulsbrigg with an army. This contempt Is an infectious plague! Exit by outside door Scene VI —Dunbar; a room opening on the courtyard. Lethington is discovered guarded by Blackadder Lethington So we are captives! Blackadder With the queen's consent: ’tis her doing. Lethington It was her grace's command that she should be met at Foulsbrigg, that her bridle-rein should be turned by Lord Bothwell, her people disarmed and led captive to Dunbar! All this is of her connivance! Blackadder Well, she provoked it. A lack of gunners on the walls gives permission to enter the keep. I pray you let not my lord find you in this temper, or, I advertise you, you will get but slaughter at his hands. Lethington You give honest counsel. I have already had contest for my life; if my sovereign lady had not laid her white hands upon my breast, I had perished like Riccio at her feet. Blackadder I must now release my lord Melvil. Lethington And detain an honest penman, a poor secretary, worth no man's malice? I shall scratch the stones with my sonnets if you do not deliver me. Blackadder I doubt not, when you have slept on this business, you will devise a method of escape. Mr. Secretary, I shall not too narrowly observe you. ’Tis the lady must be guarded for my master with all vigilance. Exit Lethington Will that villain mishandle her? Morton blurted out the miscreant had hope to be her bridegroom, and I let it pass. By heaven, I am persuaded responsibility lies about the purlieus of inaction. The stripping thieves may be corrigible; the core of evil is in the eye of the Levite.(Pacing.) A pretty adventure for St. Mark's Even, the April sunshine tracing my prison-bars against the wall. I have been an unfaithful witness; but my sovereign lady shall never know of my infamy: for I had as lief speak of the base things of my nature to God as to a woman. There are vaults for the lodging of vileness: bats are but birds of a sick conscience. Yet I know not why I should take on me the whole enormity of her perdition, seeing she is wrecked of her own nature, as our first Mother, though the snake lay in the grass. Would that Eve had been longer in the tutelage of the serpent, and refrained from blabbing to her husband of matter that, delicately handled, had secured her supremacy! But a woman can by no means keep a good thing to herself. My mistress stuffs every smile with incomparable favours. Then to repulse him!—That repulse has been her ruin. Let a woman set the man who loves her at her left hand, if she crave a fiend for her torment. Alack, she has lost God's favour, her own reputation, and the hearts of all England, Ireland, and Scotland. All hearts? Yes, she has lost them all; but she has covered me, the chameleon, with the very hue of her misfortune. I am hers till death. She shall undo me slowly. Scene VII —Dunbar; a chilling, gusty April afternoon: the Queen is seated in a window-seat, overlooking the sea Queen (Glancing toward the door) But this is surely how they turn the key Upon a captive! What strange dealings now Would fortune have with me? Ah, the blithe morn We journeyed here escaped from Holyrood! This is the very room, where I, a' hungered, Ate the fresh eggs, and sang for simple joy Of liberty, while our good host looked on, A great God love her! in his glowing eyes. To-day he had another look; he pulled My bridle-rein, and I forbore to strive; As in a fortress, when they hear the step Of foemen climbing up the secret stair, They make no more contention on the walls. I listen at the heart . . . Oh, foolishness! In all that ragged country of wild sea There is no comfort for the eye until It rests upon the solemn light-house rock, Whence light will issue, as the darkness spreads, And found a safety for the mariner: My good Lord Admiral has been to me, In my perplexed and tempest-beaten life, So sure a lode-star. (The door is unlocked) Enter Bothwell Had you entered softly, My earl, you would have heard me praising you; But what new danger is a-foot that thus— Pardon, my lord!—as a rough borderer You intercepted us as we rode back To Holyrood, and, darkly hinting peril, Made us your sudden guest? Bothwell (In a low mutter) And prisoner.—Why, There are some dangers that you must not know; We keep the details from a princess' ear Of meditated treason. You are safe Within these walls . . . most safe from all pursuit, And rid of evil counsellors. Queen How safe? Safe! That was Ruthven's cry; I was secure When my robe bore a streak of Riccio's blood, When my child leapt in terror! Safe . . . from whom? Bothwell From meddling intervention, from the need Of playing widow, and, in policy's Dull phrase, refusing me your hand. My love, Now are you safe from the confederate eyes Of blinking, envious gossips. The blank sea Before us—look at it!—a pure, white sheet; No cipher possible: yet in its sight, Its unrecording sight, there shall be action Would bring great kings to key-hole of that door Were there but bruit of it: an enterprise More hazardous and unappalled than aught On earth attempted. Can you not conjecture, My beauty? ’Tis more telling in effect Than in rehearsal. How your colour rises, Blood-red as your carnations! Ah, more wonders! I knew you would be wonderful the moment I had you thus discrowned and unattended: Like some great sight of nature you must be Explored in solitude. How magical The alteration in your lips and brow— A fearful, fluttering woman! Oh, you needed This sequestration, this harsh discipline To bring you to your senses—mark the phrase!— Your womanly, warm senses. Seated there, By the chink casement high above the sea, It is a throne that has but one descent, One deep humiliation. You refused So simply, absolutely all my proffered And honourable homage . . . A fair princess! The falcon to the prey; and what a quarry! A queen? Aye, queen all over to the small, Protesting foot that beats against my words. Will you not deign a parley? Queen James of Hepburn, Out of your mouth there shall not rise such words As burn my cheek; for I have found no treason In any of your actions. Bothwell None in this? It has a fair complexion . . . What a sudden, Sharp storm is rushing in! It covers you With flecks of foam. I love the lashing wind. (Putting up a shutter; then bending over her) You thought I was the Lord High Admiral, Sleek and submissive, fitting you a pinnace To sail to Alloa, proud to steer your craft Though the Lord Darnley were a passenger: I am a pirate, and I take my pleasure Thus, thus! (Passionately seizing her hand and kissing her) Oh, you are pround, you do not wince! I pray you cry me mercy, for I have No grace for those dark, alienated eyes: I know they glittered thus on Châtelar, Ordering the headsman. He insulted you, You say; I urge he found you heavenly fair, High, unattainable except by force: He crept to you the lad's vile, sneaking way; I take possession of you as a man. Make free surrender, would you have my triumph Unmixed with your despair. To gain my prize I have made desperate havoc with events; ’Twixt me and my ambition you have set Such obstacles! But I have hewn them down; Now you alone stand between me and all I covet. Queen The crown matrimonial? Bothwell I dare you mock me in the lisping tones Of your young, craven dotard. I shall take All matrimonial rights, all dignities, And never harry you with petulance. Do not fold down those lovely marble hands As they would never tremble any more. Breathe on me, touch me! Queen You would be a king, Loaded with honour. ’Twas my husband's first Entreaty the ambassadors should give him Full royal title—hand-plight on the bond. Bothwell These dead, chill fingers! Queen (Rising) Let us ride to town. Bothwell To-night? Queen This instant. There will be suspicion I am detained against my pleasure, which My subjects scarce will brook. Bothwell We will ride forth Together when the briny air has given My bride another cheek; two triumphing, Young lovers. Curse this arid pensiveness; Will nothing break you in? Why, I have seen you Let your soft, ruddy hair blow in my face As a flapped banner, you who banish me Your smiles, your lips. Deep, dominating clouds Are on your brow. I tell you, Marie Stuart, If you bend on me those remorseless eyes You will arouse the dull pangs of such hate As kept the devil patient in the glades Of Eden. I esteem you now a thing To cow and trample. Queen One who doubted you Less than all other creatures in the world, My once-belovèd servant. Bothwell Ah, your tones Have broken from their ice; the great, slow tears Are come at last. Dearest, you have been wed, Twice-wedded,—never loved. Queen Yea, on this wise, How often by the king! Bothwell You shed no tears On him, no great, unspeakable reproach; He could not hurt you. O my soft-browed queen, Have we not shared a secret, you and I, On through your plighted bondage to the hour Of your deliverance, and ’tis broken now With terror, as the shaking up of tombs Upon the day of judgment. Were you roused After a dusty, unsuspicious sleep A thousand years in Holyrood, and bidden Go fetch your husband—would you dare unlock The neighbour tomb? Queen Nay, but I do not doubt With half-affrighted wits I should look out, And bribe an angel to bring thitherward My trusty earl . . . Bothwell O excellent caprice! And with his arm around you . . . Queen I would say In simple hardihood I loved the man, I held him worthy, and to him would cling Silent, the while my clamorous lords rehearsed Their memories of me. Now indeed you laugh. Ay, let us laugh together; yet I fear These good men are conspirators: I could Unfold my reasons, but to-night I tire, As once before after too long a ride. Send Melvil to me, it is growing dusk. Bothwell Melvil is gone. Queen I am right weary, cold, And sick at heart. The flame is almost ash Upon the stone. Go, fetch my women to me. I would have rest and warmth. Bothwell Your maids are back At Holyrood. Queen Then do you light the fire, And bring me supper. O believe me, earl, I know a prisoner's shifts; in my own palace I and Argyle have broken bread together For very hunger. Give me entertainment; Retain the borderer's virtues: to a guest Shelter and safe repose. Bothwell I will return. Exit Queen To keep him human! ’Tis my single safety To show him all my love; I ne'er have wanted Resource. I will make speed to victory Under the lowering heavens. Re-enter Bothwell with firewood, food, and wine Why, we are back To simple manners, yet I keep my state. You bring a light, and, see! my dripping cloak Is a wet shroud about me.—Can you find The clasp?—Unbuckle it, and set to dry: Now make a ruddy blaze. Here at Dunbar I must be merry, for I feel at home In this great room with access to the air, Free winds, and hurricane. Bothwell (Unclasping and shaking her cloak) A stormy petrel With spray upon her wings! Queen Now let us eat; But, as a grace, if I have used you hardly Think it my rash, quick temper, and forgive. So now you have your will; at supper-time I never can be formal: ’tis the hour For much unburthening of the heart. My lord, Would you but give safe-conduct to my speech . . . . Bothwell I will lie down low at your feet, and gaze At your great beauty kindling in the flame, With all the vaporous glooms about your head. Ah, I grow humble in this happiness, Your slave! But first, my despot, knot the smile, The rare smile of your lips, into a kiss. Queen At my lips' leisure. I shall dream to-night O' my babe asleep at Stirling. I would fain Lay the boy in your keeping: we will plot To-morrow how to make the claim on Mar. Bothwell Still ice these hands. Queen I have been much distempered Of late—Will you not chafe them?—With no loyal, True-hearted friend to be my counsellor. O Hepburn, ill-suspicion drives me mad; I could not toss an apple to my child But they must snatch it from him. Lethington Does not support me; I can find no way Of pleasing my vexed subjects. Bothwell (Rising) I could name you A score of Scotland's weightiest, bonded men To force you into marriage. Queen They are traitors. Is it to save me from them you pursued This morn your rough, unwarrantable course? Bothwell ’Tis to enact their policy. At supper One night at Ainslie's tavern I was host To the good houses that acquitted me, Moray, Argyle, Huntly and Cassilis— You know the faction—Eglinton slipped off: We fell to loyal drinking of your health, Praise of your beauty, and Lord Huntly swore I was your darling; ay, my mermaid, so They painted you, with the eyes' furious flash, Across the banner where with double thong You beat the hounds off from your hunted love. Your face confirms conjecture. To be brief, My merry mates signed this. (Presenting the Bond) Queen (Overlooking the page) Not Eglinton . . . Morton and Moray.—Where is Maitland's name? We will consider these ill-worded clauses, Conceived in wantonness, and, as our judgment Directs, yield them response. Release my hand! It was the earl's; I give no drunken suitor Such privilege. (She rises and goes to a window) Bothwell Affix your signature, And then, the business of the day at end, I will retire. Queen (Looking out) There are no stars to-night; I simply catch the roaring of the sea When I look out. I used to call my mother On nights like these—I was a timid child— Till she refused to come, and bid me lie And trust in God. I have learnt confidence; No fear is in my soul. Bothwell Sign me the bond. Queen No, no; ’tis for my bosom, A casket letter, a most precious scroll; Let me peruse it fully. One by one I shall learn all my enemies by name; Never will I be parted from this bond, This drunken, crazy prayer, this publican And rank solicitation. Give me leisure . . . My husband haunted taverns. Bothwell You were best Call me your husband also—You look calm, And smooth your ruffled laces while I speak— Let us forget him! Come, let's clink the cups! What is it scares you? There shall be a parson To put us in the noose. I mean to rule: Jane Gordon knows my tactics—a divorce Grounded on our affinity; meanwhile . . . Queen (Descending from the window, where she has stood, reading the bond) Will you bring candles; there is this to read; ’Tis a state-paper and of much concern. No, put the wine away; my head is giddy; I must be vigilant: set me a taper. I shall be busy till the morning break; Then come to me; you will find all prepared. (Apart) Oh, trust me, I will tell a score of lies To save him from this infamy.—I feel A promptness and despatch. What, faint again! You should have kept my women, for I fear This sickness may be fatal. Bothwell (Supporting her) Give me leave. Marie, these tears upon me! Queen Nay, good-night. I have no malice being nigh to death. How strange it is! Are all the hangings black? You used to love gay tapestry. Bothwell My queen, Your mind is wandering; you need food and rest. I swear I will not pester you; be calm, Sleep safe till daybreak. Queen Then the warders come And open. Ay, you asked me for a kiss. Goodnight, good earl. (She kisses him) Bothwell My pardon! Queen If I die, All's fresh with morning. I must presently Con this untoward paper. Leave me, earl; You have no head for crises. Bothwell (Slowly retiring and glancing back doubtfully) A great figure! How all her youth is gone—I scarce desire her, Sick and enfeebled; and the touch of scorn. If she should circumvent me! We are both In hell, which is but unfulfilment, power Looking across a waste. Exit Queen Throughout the night No change of posture—I must weary him With court formalities and Europe's front: So dies the girl in me. Ah, God, I would I were in Holyrood to close this breach I' my honour by the headsman. Violence, threats! What is there more to suffer? The young sea-mews Wheel free about their nests, and, if they fall, Dash bloody in the spray. I fear no ruin That's sudden and precipitous—The bond! (She lays it out before her; then falls into a fit of abstraction; her head bows over her hands, and she sleeps) Scene VIII —Dunbar: ante-chamber to the room in which the Queen is captive Enter Bothwell Bothwell She leans her ear for ever toward the bridge Across which press the armaments of wind, But no leal rescue. I importuned her Seven blank and awful days, until I breathed Within a vacuum; the estrangement grew So heavy, insupportable, I fain Had murdered her to crush the anguish out, But then I knew her smile would welcome death, And leave me stunned and jealous. Once indeed She flooded me with a wide gaze of love Dazzling, forlorn: and I beholding it Could make no sign,—it was as if a damned, A new-damned soul had caught God's agony At sight of the impenetrable fosse. Since then I have not plagued her. Horrible This lonesomeness, abandon! I have wandered Two days among the gullies on the coast, And watched the embattled breakers bursting through Their narrow, counter archways in the rocks, To heave together in a central mound Of foam, then fall back in a refluent peace. A stormy clash of marriage! Why this harass, Withdrawal and exclusion? In her heart She keeps the bounties of her nature guarded For my attainment, yet suppresses them, Wronging herself, polluting me. I never Will take what is a rapture in the gift; But force the tardy welcome in her blood To speak truth to me, for there is a truth Between us: I have lived on it from day To stormy daybreak. (To Paris who has entered with food and wine) Paris, go within; Say I have fallen from the cliff, and lie Below stark in the courtyard. Do my will, And leave the door flung open. (Paris passes within) (Listening and repeating the Queen's words) He is dead! How shall I wait the issue? There is pause, And then a fond, low sobbing, and a cry— (Springing to the open doorway) My love, my love! ACT V. Scene I —Holyrood; a distant apartment: Mary Seton and Mary Livingstone Mary Seton She is changed As the dead change the morning and the eve Of the first day. I bent to take her hood, When we received her at the Castle-gate After her guarded journey from Dunbar,— Then dropped my hands and left her. Mary Livingstone Noisily The earl dismissed us, with his truculent And frowning carriage. Fast he drove his business, And, being new-divorced from Lady Jane, Announced himself the bridegroom of our queen, With threats compelled the kirk to read their banns; Then spent two straining hours of trouble lost To win the English queen's ambassador To look upon their union; at the council He sat as king— Mary Seton Our mistress puts her hand To any paper, will remit and pardon The worst offences with a face as dull And unconcerned as if men's good and evil Were one to her. Mary Livingstone My rebel eloquence Has kept the palace ringing with her wrong; Traquair and Erskine listen with a blush Across their brows, and Lady Lethington Hints there will be deliverance. Could I fan you Into my flame! Mary Seton I saw her first again When late in afternoon she made him Duke Of Orkney and the Shetlands, on the vigil Of her reputed marriage-day. She gave Her head a sportive and capricious arch, As she were playing queenship and no queen; Yet, when he entered, with a heaving bosom She kept her ground so regnantly he bent Irresolute, subjected. Mary Livingstone He is careful To show the deference of bonnet off: She laughs, I verily believe she laughs When he uncovers. Mary Seton But the marriage-day! There is no midnight in these summer nights; It was not one o'clock when I awoke To dress her for the dismal rites of dawn; And, thridding the white darkness to her door, Swung open ’gainst the bed, I found her wrapt In her black widow's weeds from head to foot, But yet apparelled in a sort of joy That frightened me. To-day there will be feast I broke out, prompted to the erring word: Then she, the strangeness in her eyes and lips Of one who is admonished to his death, Answered, To-day there is no festival. Where the tree falleth, Marie, it must lie; It falls to northern dolour, stricken north— Inclining south, to life and blessedness. Thus in no jewels but her shining tears She passed to her mock marriage. Mary Livingstone Worst of all Was her consent to marry Protestant, With preaching, not the mass. Mary Seton She took no heed Of anything they said, and when the sermon Was ended, as a creature from its sleep Rises to wander through the night, with eyes Vacant, unflickering, fearful, she stood up, And paced of her own motion through the door. No games nor any pastime! Not a flower Was gathered to breathe forth its parable Of Hymen's hours o'maying. Nature seemed To turn aside, man to recoil, and time To slight the circumstance. The very stars Shone round the sky like candles at a wake. Could you have borne it? Mary Livingstone Not as she has done; But then she is a queen, and by surrender She saves her title's honour—so was lofty Through all the farce, and, withering at its rites, She yet adorned them. How these Protestants Have wrecked her like an abbey, and enslaved Her altar to their schism, and yet she draws Around such blasphemies compulsive grace Lent by the true religion. Policy, Great pride, and custom—not her conscience—vouched This marriage; it will be annull'd, and then, Sweet name-fellow, we two shall find a place Beside her first approachable distress, So much we love her still. Mary Seton So much? Ah, more, With sorer love. If I might take her soul And shroud it tight forever from her God! He must not see her tarnish.—And these things Are prattle of the court. Mary Livingstone Our earls and nobles Troop northward to the cradle of the prince, And arm themselves at Stirling. Mary Seton There is wrath That does not move abroad as vengeance doth, But perfects wickedness until it drop: ’Tis so she must be loosened of her curse. Scene II —Holyrood; the Queen's bed-chamber: the door is ajar, she overhears talk in the audience-chamber Bothwell (Within) Fellows, have any passed to her? Erskine (Within) The queen Has been retired all day, and white beyond Her girlhood's famous white. Her eyes look ill. Bothwell The devil! what ado about her health; She is a very plague. I'll visit her, When I have spoken further with the guard. (Silence) Queen Can love be terror? I am almost sure That hate can love . . . I feel it in myself. God, keep my hatred single, let me be A desolated woman, and my life Like a burnt city salted by the foe; Let not one leaf or blade be visible This Maytime in my calendar! The man, I loathe and wed, is growing dear as sin, Precious as was my wrath the vengeful night Of Riccio's murder, and beloved as are Mere passions in their transit. He has handled My soul unlawfully in forcing me, His victim, to turn wife; yet very death Withdrawing from my neighbourhood swift means For its extreme of safety, joined with him To work a second outrage, and to plant His stain across my will. But more than this . . . I have a fear; a monstrous hopelessness Makes vision red before me. It was born Of his embrace: I cannot now believe That in his nature there is innocence, Not any . . . Oh, I must not bide alone, With this conception out upon the air. (Calling) Erskine! Erskine (At the door) Dear madam. Queen Why is this? Erskine You called. How lone you grow—one waiting-woman, scarce A courtier, every passage and apartment Ranged with steel arquebusiers. Are you free As you declared, sweet queen? Queen You find I am. No bolt across the door! Erskine I have not long In which to speak my faith to you, who are Beauty and consecration to my life; But if my service could afford you comfort ’Tis yours, though all yon shifting points of iron Were level to my heart. Queen (Apart) Then shall I ask For knife or sudden poison? Futile prayer! For well I know he keeps me out of death By fascinating blandishment, that has The tiger in it, yet man's faithfulness, And will not end, nor let me fail—until God loose me of his mercy from the charm. (To Erskine) I thank you, brave esquire, for your confession Of youth's devoutness, such as makes the spring Show reverence to the twilight, offering all Its sun-born, crescent virtues, and sweet breath In eve's dim presence. I accept your vows, Your constancy, your warmth with these dropped tears, The bounty of my gratitude. Erskine Last year, You had fresh eyes, and smiles that did not know That they were in your face. It sends me mad When splendour changes, and I almost turn Apostate to my youth. Queen I heard the duke? Erskine He went to charge the guardsmen. But you called: Madam, you lack some office? Queen Ah!—a draught Of water pure and cold. Erskine Not wine? Queen No, no! (Apart) For when I drink the goblet he has filled The vintage dyes my fancies. Erskine I will hasten To bring a fountain-cup. Exit Queen Tell me, Traquair, If the duke mounts, for he has promised me His presence by this hour. (Traquair comes to her door) Traquair Lady, my faith! I hear him swearing roundly in the court, A growl full-formed. Queen I did not ask for this. Traquair Yea, if I heard him. He would spread a field With thunder in his passion. Queen Sir, your tongue Is master of your breeding. Traquair Pardon me, I am too rash, and your displeasure is A curb that makes me shiver. Queen I have left A black hood on my daïs. Will you fetch it. (Traquair goes into the audience-chamber) For I must put it out of sight; he tore My sable widow-raiment from my bosom Some days ago, that I should wear this dress Of harsh and flaunting scarlet. (Traquair brings the hood) Thanks, my knight! (Apart) A stormy noise of steps, a door! My nerves Fly to some hole or cover . . . but retreat Is earthed up by his presence. Enter Bothwell. Bothwell Who is here? Why do you coy it with this lad? I ordered Your vile and hellish mourning to your chest, Until you please to put it on for me. (As if recollecting Traquair's presence) Pardon, my sovereign lady. Do not visit My rudeness with desert. Some deep concerns Weight me till you give judgment. (To Traquair) Leave the queen, And see you keep your distance. Do you hear? Traquair Yes, my lord duke. Queen (Softly) Obey him. Exit Traquair (Bothwell slams the door after him and turns gloomily to the Queen. A knocking is heard) Bothwell Who will dare Knock at this door, I wonder. (Opens to Erskine) Get you off! Intrude upon our privacy again You answer with your life. Erskine But I was sent By madam for this goblet. Bothwell (Recollecting himself, seizing his cap and bowing to the Queen) It is fitting You do her service. Give the vessel here, And keep your distance as your fellow does. Erskine I am a gentleman . . . Queen Sir Arthur, go. Exit Erskine, with a deep how to the Queen Bothwell Inconstant, as this water! You must fondle Your equerry to bring it! By all devils, You shall be plagued like thirsty Tantalus. (Dashing it on the floor) Cannot you rule your people, make your mobs Obedient to my hand, instead of teaching These amorous youngsters to be insolent! I am half-mad with burthens. (Pacing frantically) Sold, deserted, Mocked and withstood, I have been made the dupe Of mentionless deceit. Queen (Apart) Within his eyes What dreary menace!—Tell me of your grief. Bothwell And you false too. I know it by the way You tempt these boys and let them wheel about Your presence, damn you! They have courtly skins And I these wound-creased brows. Death! I believed I had a grasp like fate, and everything Is slipping into limbo: first my state, My coadjutors, and my squadrons vanish, And then my queen slips like a phantom-shape Of mist to others' bosoms. Queen (Wringing her hands) Would that God Knew I was not your slave! I burn to share Your molten sorrows. Bothwell O my hand-fast wife, Are you then heart-fast too? Queen I cannot say What ties me to your will, that, like a horse, Sweeps me through unknown empires. I should faint To nothingness unless it governed me. What must I do to help you? Bothwell Every one, Oath-bound to join with me, is splitting off; The folk are sullen; I have made them sports, Shown them my deeds of arms, and you have watched As if I were your rock of lode-stone, ever A claim upon your sight: yet still they grumble. There is but this to cheer them—you must sign A revocation of all licenses To use the Roman worship. You and I Are Protestants . . . so lift no hesitation Upon your lips to vex me. Take the pen, And write your signature. (Giving her a deed) Queen (Turning to a table mechanically and with despair) (Apart) No, holy Saints, I cannot listen to your keen addresses— This marriage-ring is seated on my hand; It is too late to chide me. He has taken The honour of my spirit, my religion; I can forswear apostacy no more Than rid my finger from its hoop of doom. (She signs and hands the deed to him) There, James; I almost fancy me a witch, With Satan for my master. (She laughs bollowly) Bothwell (Kissing her) Done, brave heart! Now let me have your child to keep and guard, Or the false lords will seize him. Queen (Recoiling fiercely) You have cast me On nature, taken all my sacraments; On nature I will stand, and as a mother Be there invincible. You shall not have him. Bothwell What do you mean? Queen I have no force of thought To understand it—I who have dissevered My own, dear sapling from my breast. Bothwell The rebels Will put the crown upon him, and convey To him your royalties. Queen They all are his; He has my blood within him, and my milk Has bred him for a crownet. Bothwell O kneel down, And do as Popish Mary to the Christ, Acknowledge him your king. Queen My womanhood Has often prayed before him; but the chrism, The consecrating oil of sovereignty Forbids it to his queen. Bothwell You go the way To make me hate him, and you cannot measure What hatred were in me, because your eyes Transform its dull rock to a jewelled passion With but one glance of light—Your bairn, however, With fool-begotten stare, could fetch no kindness Out of my detestation. Queen Oh, a sword, A knife to end this bitterness, or else Within St. Margaret's pool, so cold with winds, To drown myself! You cannot hinder me, If you dismay the wild, maternal pulse Past nature's own insanity.—A sword! Erskine (Within) Her cry at violence; what a haunting scream! Help, beat the door down! Traquair (Within) I shall hold you here. He is her husband. Bothwell (Apart) I have heard of storms In which an unimpeded wind has stretched The frantic sea-waves level, while it cries Above the soundless plane: she sweeps my will, My wrath down into silence. Queen (Coming near to him) Have you thought What utter hatred would be like in me? How in my eyes it were a basilisk Of frightful charm, and in my voice the song Of syren from her seat among the bones? Have you beheld the vision? Very soon It will be actual, and face to face. Bothwell Ha!—Turn away! You do not understand I pressed a policy, no despot whim— A threat to make you reasonable—that Was all my hot intent. The lords henceforth Will rally round your son, anoint him king, And leave you like the altar of the mass In a purged Romish church; but if you rather Will bear such violation than resist, I cannot help it, and will never ask To have your child again, although your madness Should ruin our linked government. Queen You promise? Bothwell The devil seize you! What tormenting power Is in your motions! But you cannot see, For all your deep endowment, that this clash Of quarrel strikes me haggard. By our God, I swear to keep my peace about the boy: Mar would not give him up. You wrong my aim; On me you look adversely with an anger Imperative, primæval, yet unjust As it is blind and senseless. Houri-love, My martial, witching star, if you should fail me, I am alone and worsted. O bend down; These raging tears fall over you. Queen Nay, nay! What would you have? Bothwell Your pity, your approach— Pardon! Queen A fellow anguish, as of rain Meeting the torrent-sea has brought my head, Where it now rests. (Sobbing on his shoulder) James, do not ask forgiveness; Between us by no possibility There now can be exchange. Bothwell At least your lips, My queen! Queen You need not ask—I am a ruin, Your wishes pierce wherever they may list. Leave me to sleep. My lord, I must not taste This great, salt weeping as you kiss me. Bothwell So We end this great unkindness. Queen Ay, even so. (As he goes to the doorway of the private stair, he passes by the neighbouring tapestry) Bothwell Phaeton's red-harnessed horses, grey as doom, And he himself ’mong their tumultuous hoofs . . . Such picture by her bedside! He who owned This stairway's rights before me fell in chaos; I tread where he did, leaving her. What Fury Set up this woful Gobelin! Exit Queen When I hear His feet within the turret, my whole frame Remembers by degrees, and yet to-day Perchance my doubts were false and passionate Scene III —Holyrood; a room in the palace: Lethington is discovered writing despatches Enter Lady Lethington Lethington Well, Mary, will her grace be pleased to sign these despatches? Lady Lethington I know not: you have the dreariest brows. Lethington For I love her infinitely; this is the last service I shall render her. It is plain I must resign my stewardship and away to everlasting habitations! Lady Lethington What do you mean? You will not die? I am sure you are ill; for you lie awake all night without stirring. I must conclude you are ill. Lethington Do you conceive it possible to secure rest in a palace tramped by barbarians? I tell you, Mary, the voice of that homicide . . . Lady Lethington Then you imagine he is the king's murderer? Lethington Tush, child, that were a small matter: he makes onslaught on the delicate fabric of the mind; he invades the region of alternatives and possibilities, and crushes the tender shoots of inclination. I have not a brain to bear predatory impairment. Sweet wife, there were gentler housing for thy sick spouse at Stirling. Lady Lethington What! You will not leave the queen? Lethington Ay, haply for the moment, for the quieting of my country, and the re-knitting of my mind. Lady Lethington You are not faithful? Lethington The chameleon, my pretty moralist, is faithful to the light through variance—its susceptibility changes its dyes. Faithful to what? Lady Lethington To be faithful is to be fixed and constant. To be faithful in religion is to have ever the same mind toward God. Lethington The fidelity of an imbecile! I must love my God humanly, not with stiff constancy, but with every mood I have—not a single devout strain—but with jealousy, contrition, humbleness, and pride. Shall we give all our heart to a mortal, and a few notes of piety to our God? But your pardon, my rigorous philosopher; I demand of you nothing better than the observance of your own maxims. It is the glory of a woman to maintain the creed of her espousals. How prospers the royal honeymoon upstairs? Lady Lethington Most unhappily, to judge by the queen's countenance. But she will not lose her senses, as ’tis reported. It is the duke who blocks up the passage, and lets his hands drop. (Bothwell is heard tramping above) Lethington He is insufferable—do but listen!—the confusion of palaces. Mary, heaven arm thee with thy lord's fell eloquence to bring down the queen. Lady Lethington I am ever your servant to perform your behests. Your kisses are the bribe of my obedience. You seek to make me an unhappy wife, that my fortunes may equal those of my mistress. Lethington Nay, my spouse, you are mated with wisdom, and the price of wisdom is above rubies. Be not malcontent. Go, urge the queen. The ambassadors start for England to-night. It may be I too shall be absent. (Kissing her) God be with you, dear. Exit Lady Lethington (Turning to the despatches) The last service I shall perform for her! The duke had slain me yesterday, but for her intervention. I must leave her; it is the beginning of my great attachment. Farewell to ideas, dreams, policies; farewell to unity! The heir to the English kingdom should be full of all comely conditions, and she hangs as a blanched leaf on a bough. Yet it pierces me to the heart to note how she keeps her queenship to me as I were the single loyal subject in the world. Could she recover! She must bide somewhere in prison (shrugging his shoulders as he hears more noise) till we get that barbarian hanged. Afterwards . . . No, there is no restoration possible; but I shall but seem to abandon her. I am cursed by the tenacity of my affections. When I was a boy they set me to keep watch over the dead. It was a duty without issue; and there is in me a fund of patience for a sort of posthumous religion. Enter the Queen (She takes a pen and bends over the despatches) Queen I do not ask How you have told the truth of these last days You have had vision of. Lethington (Apart) She need not lower Her lids, her wide, brimmed eyes are reticent; And yet there is expansion on the lips And brows—that luminous, poetic shine, The presage of some great impolicy. Queen (Putting away the despatches) Ay, I have signed them all; if dreamily, Forgive me: for a peace comes down and softens My sorrows when I dream. How bare the world Would be without the dead! Lethington Of whom, dear queen, May you be taking thought? Queen I think no more Of one or two; they come in multitudes Within me, down the currents of my blood; And the great, outer host drawn in with breath. There is no time in them; it is alike If they fell ages back, or yesterday; And Helen, shadowed by Ægyptus' shore, Moves close to me; she clasps Theonoë About the neck, and through the lotus-flowers The women press together. Lethington Ay, the phantom, Not the live Helen. Queen She who was a queen. I love the legend that she never swerved From wifely faith, that Paris' capture was A spectre that dislimned into thin air When Proteus from his shadow in the rocks Rose, and restored his guarded fugitive Unblemished to her husband. All those years Of bloodshed and reproach she had been held In sanctuary, and where her soul received No sound of her ill-fame. It seems to me One may be so withdrawn, even from the clamour Of those who love and fight and suffer wrong For the poor image of oneself, the clay, Not the live creature, Lethington. I seek To give you apprehension of the facts That have been open to your ken these last Tumultuous weeks—for you have still your queen Preserved by mystic charity from taint Of noisome accident, and overcome Of none, being so secluded in herself, Storms have no access to her. Lethington Can you doubt, My sovereign, that my deepest faith is yours, Though to pursue your pretty simile, I hold the lovely Greek so deep in awe, That when I see her injurers, almost I perish of pure passion, as the elms, Planted about Protesilaus' tomb, Faded as fast as their aspiring shoots Caught glimpse of Ilium. Queen Hush, that red Dunbar. (Taking his hands and clasping them) How many years You were my mother's counsellor; how oft By luring sagesse you have drawn me back From folly: you can aid me now no more. Wide ruin overhangs. ’Tis pitiful To bear a name that in its overthrow Carries fair kingdoms, and leaves tremulous The pillars of the church: I bear such name, I front such ominous fortune. Put away These papers; it is plain that we must part: God will not suffer me one comfort now. I cannot see you murdered in my sight; Therefore you must be gone. Yet stay awhile— (Taking an ornament from her neck) I have an oval ornament of gold, Enamelled with a curious device From Æsop's fable of the netted lion, And his most nimble-toothed deliverer; With these Italian words: non mancano Le forze a chi basto l' animo Written around it. I have often sighed, Touching the trinket, ere I laid it by— For see, the violet cord is worn with use— O'er this entoiled, forsaken royalty, And the persistent, liberating force Beside it. Should there ever be occasion For breaking the captivity, return This gift; my cipher graven within its lid Is pregnant as a pass-word to my love, And closer than a signet. You have never Signed any the vile bonds my enemies Have published in their hate: receive this token Of grace and benediction from your queen. Lethington Madam, this golden outbreak fron the cloud . . . Queen My courtier! I shall lose so soon the voice Whose every invocation was a spell, And yet must break its music. We shall talk No more together. Though I were content To lie and let the waves fall over me, As a wrecked barque that, when the storm is spent, Suffers the soft mishandling of the tides, I still am treasurer of the crown. How fares My boy? You have much intercourse with Mar; The lords are gathered in a camp at Stirling Around his cradle. Lethington Have but patience, madam, You too shall be delivered. Queen How is this? It doth not need conspiracy to quench Ambition such as his, so dissolute. (Throwing herself on a seat and passionately weeping) I cannot banish him; he would return. Lethington Ay, the light, spectral way of guilty souls: You have your rosary. Queen It will be pastime To count my beads on the dark swards of hell. Maitland, my soul is ciphered Catholic, And yet I have withdrawn the licences At the duke's pleasure. I am slight of will. Enter Bothwell Leave us till dinner-time. Bothwell (Advancing) What, closeted With Lyd, your secretary—an old offence! You shall not have another faithful servant Like David Riccio. Ah, you whiten, sir. Lethington It is my wont at blasphemy. Proceed! Are these for my revision? (Attempting to take some papers from Bothwell) Bothwell (Grasping them) I have writ Brief record of my mind and purposes To England. I can front Elizabeth As you; I do not need your artifice. (Turning to the Queen) O Marie, would you see a borderer Expend his hate, at last fall to the feast Of long, unsated, devilish detestation? (Relaxing his hold at the Queen's intercession) Nay then, he shall be spared; but since you cast On me your ravishment, and since you turn The dun side of your beauty to my face, Setting the wind of your hot sighs to blast My rash, desirous moments, since you thwart me, And magnify this pard—I will unfold The smooth and cowardly creature you esteem. This man heard Morton promise me your hand, And to and fro he journeyed prospering My heady plans; he is the sorcerer To lure your mates to death, one after one; He sits, and sees them drop away from you, But yet he meddles not. Now chat together; He will advise you how you may entoil A second victim. I will leave you now. Exit Queen To think that you were with me at Dunbar! Lethington You saved my life. Queen (Looking toward the door) He cannot be a king; They wither, or are murdered, or grow mad Who link themselves with me in sovereignty. Twilight and ruin settle on us both! Oh, might we be forgotten; could we lie In the blank pardon of oblivion! That, Alack, can never be; there is no man Can give me safety, or protection, or Peace from vicissitude; I have no lover, Servant or friend; and yet I am beloved Even to marvel. I can pray no more, I have no more dependence upon God; And none on any of His creatures, none. Go, tell my story as you learnt it, add New matter. If I sat beside the fire, In prison with my maids, and never spoke, While you put forth fresh libels, or confirmed The common talk, you could not injure me: My silence would have privilege. Lethington Your pardon; My task is now to write an epitaph: Here lies a royal lady who defamed Each soul that did her service, unashamed; And loved to raise the vicious to such grace That heaven and hell were centred in one place. So I unclasp my shackles. (Unclasping the ornament) Queen (Looking steadfastly at Lethington) By consent He seized me at Dunbar? The Tolbooth gauged The pressure of my passions; and the cartels Will pass me truly to posterity, While you admit the portrait? Lethington Libellers Are sure of popularity. My brain Treasures a rare, untarnished miniature; With that I shall not part. (She gazes at him, sobbing) Nay, pardon now, Full pardon, great, obliterating sea, Of love o'erwhelm me! You have heaven's own measure: The seventy-times-and-seven is in your eyes, Immeasurable grace. There is no need Of this slave's token; but I put it back. (Kissing the gold ornament) God shield you from dishonour! May He draw Blood of me, when my life has other use Than to protect your titles. Queen It was thus I dreamed of you. Farewell. Scene IV —Borthwick; the battlements, with a courtyard below Enter on to the battlements Blackadder and the Castellan Blackadder This flight from Holyrood, because ’twas mooted The lords were on the march, is argument To sure disaster. Castellan Though the duke is gone Among the border ridges to collect An army at Melrose, I have no faith That he can draw the commons after him; For her black weeping has estranged men's hearts Acutely from his service. Blackadder She is restless As any creature that has lost its mate, Since he has left her side: she does not sleep, Nor sit, nor feed, nor use her supple hands In needlework or music, but grows thin With pacing, and distempered meditation. Crookstan, this fidget of a woman's soul Sets me distraught. I cannot understand The weeping and constraint of her behaviour At Holyrood, and this sharp pining now. She hates him or she loves him: but which horn Of this dilemma she is pitched upon No son of woman knows. Castellan Hold! Here she comes, Untended ’mid that gaiety of dress She flaunts in since he took her. Exit Blackadder Enter Queen Queen Castellan, Are troops in sight? The twilight thwarts mine eyes. Castellan There is a rumour that the earls of Mar, Morton, Montrose, are pressing to our keep With Lindsey, Hume. Queen (Stamping impatiently) In answer to my summons? Castellan Madam, your proclamation is as waste. Queen I look forth on a kingdom that is mine, Yet stand here helpless as a country-lass. Peace, peace! Bring me an army. Scan the space; Is there no moving colour on the verge? Castellan I have been out twice to the mound and shouted; The hills were deaf—it is an evil sign. (Moving to the other side) Queen If I should pray! Below there is soft frolic in the fields, Summer and grassy harvest. God, instead Plant me an army for his marshalling; Remount his courage, lest the last disdain Come o'er me, tempting me to fling him off! Enter the Maries. How now! What, women, treble voices—tush! Well, girls, your service? Are there no relays? You have sharp, shining eyes: look to the west. Mary Livingstone Madam, we come to alter your attire; For if the duke . . . Queen O frippery! Your husbands should be grooms; Break your lords' anger with a string of pearls! Away with you, you puppets of the court! There are no pages here to find delight In your small modes. Exeunt The leaflets of this rosebush Are plucked away; how desperate I am! Do I not hear his step? My ardours grow With fear and with despair. Enter Blackadder Blackadder My lord returns, Is solitary, changed, a very devil. Leave us to brave him. Queen But I never dread The open air, the vehemence, the storm Of a man's nature. (Apart) ’Tis his underground Fidelity of force that holds me down, As Plutus kept hell-closed Proserpina; I should enjoy his rage. Enter Bothwell: he passes the Queen without notice and stares over the country Blackadder (To Castellan) Look there! (Pointing to Bothwell) Castellan My God! (A deep pause) Blackadder (To Castellan) Is not that movement to the north a band Of riders? Castellan Slip round by the other side; So let us reach the stair. I may not venture To question our commander, but I think Some peril is approaching. Come away. Blackadder (Watching the Queen and Bothwell) They stand against that cloud as still as towers Stand through the night. (Blackadder and the Castellan pass round the further battlement, and the Castellan descends; as Blackadder is descending Bothwell turns) Bothwell Tell them to make my bed. Blackadder Yes, yes, my lord. Bothwell Strip all the covers off; ’Tis hot. Blackadder My lord, I will. Exit Bothwell continues to gaze out, and takes no notice of the Queen Queen (Apart) It is not safe To guard this solitude. (Aloud) What, perdu, love— So weary and dishevelled? You are dumb And trembling . . . . (Apart) Still no answer. All the world Becomes a silence. Stars, stars, break the heat With some swift declaration; nightingale, Sing through your gurgling blood to us! Bothwell (Suddenly moving to the stair) I'll go, I will be off to couch me. Queen (As be passes) Are you ill? Bothwell Damned by your love. Ha, ha, I have been king A month or so, have swayed it in good earnest, And made my queen my vassal. ’Tis all done! I have had royal quarters . . . At Melrose There is no army. I have torn the crown In haste to seize it, pulled the throne on me; But when I sit and whistle on my prow . . . Queen James, James, you dare not leave me? Bothwell Those famed eyes Have learned to make entreaty to my will. When I sit whistling on my prow at sea, Among my buccaneers, I shall make boast— Of what, my sovereign dame? (The Queen starts towards the battlements' edge; Bothwell violently pushes her back against the roof) Oh, you have courage! Your old trick at Dunbar,—it awed me then. You cannot give me pleasure any more With your stained, dripping face. ’Tis over, girl, This play at kings and queens. Will you not come Aboard with me? I had a Danish wife, Whom I left stranded on the Netherlands When she had served my turn. Your resolution? Ay, handy-dandy with me, up and down— I will not be your jailor; you are free: The lords are gathering for your rescue: open, Let them burst in and murder me. To-night I'll sleep—destruction!—sleep with open window, And let all go to rack. Exit Queen Within my head There is a clang as if great gates of iron Shook, and then opened to a breeze. My limbs Quaver as do the hill-curves in the heat. Nothing is altered—only he is gone, Oppressive in his insolence and gross As manhood is when it descends beneath A woman's foot. Darnley and Lethington And Moray—so I have been taught contempt From note to note: the compass now is reached; I cannot stretch beyond to-day the limit Of scorn, for it is full and perfect, striking This man I reckoned faithful as the seasons, My horoscope, or death. A loosed possession! And I am that—cast off with lack of love By an insensate hand! O God, the light That pours unblinking inward—and how large A difference in my heart! Enter Castellan and Blackadder in the courtyard below Castellan (To Blackadder) Go fetch my lord; A troop without say they are hunted friends, And I must open. Blackadder He is laid a' bed, Or just undressing. I shall have a thud Of passion for my message. Castellan Go. Exit Blackadder Queen (Listening) A tumult Against the bank! Re-enter below Bothwell and Blackadder Blackadder Your doublet is not on. Bothwell Curses! I'll not be touched—Just pull this down— Where is that madman Crookstan? Blast your wits! Lock, lock and hold! It is a stratagem. Fool, must I slumber to be caught alive For durance through your softness? All is up! We have no food or arms to meet a siege, Scarcely a dozen men within the walls For sortie or repulse. Cries (Outside the gates) Assassin, out! Butcher, come forth! (Confused execrations) Bothwell I have not one resolve. (Apart) The mast is broken, and the striving sail Falls down it in a heap. There is such rage Of hopeless circumstance about my ears, It desolates my force as if I heard The water-kelpie howl—a sweating panic. Had I but slept an hour! Cries Ha, ha, come forth— A murderer, a regicide! Bothwell Confound Their vile abuse, dishonourable noise! Who would have thought this grey and silent hour Would hoot outrageous titles, and besiege My sense with clamour? Castellan You will never let Their ribald anger put you out of heart. My lord, I wait directions. Cries Ravisher! Bothwell I cannot stay. Crookstan, I know all voices That reach this earthly life of ours; the shout Of battle and the predatory din, Woman's soft-worded breath, the hurling stream In flood and hate, the sorrow of the wind When ghosts are in its tide—all, save this cry Round a defenceless castle, round about Our unprotected conscience. Send your son To meet me at the postern. Castellan For escape? Bothwell For anything, for peace—I cannot stay, Hedged in by such offence, Exit Castellan drawn on to flight By something voiceful, and by such distraction As turns all ways to menace me. Ay, yell Below there in the pit! This midsummer, Far sky is cavernous above my head, Huge, full of wondrous passes through the stars: It looked so from the hole at Lindisfarne They put me in; and when I choke at night, Wrung with a nightmare, ’tis not Kirk o' Field That sets me gasping; but a low, arched room, With iron trellis and a muffled door, Where I must hold my breath till they have clamped His bonds about a captive who begins A fairy thrall of twenty thousand years! (More cries) Howl up your execrations! Guilty, lords, To every charge. Cries Adulteress! Bothwell Let alone That cry, confounding her with my misdeeds. She shall not hear it—infamy! (Turning in the direction of the execrating lords) To sweep Across you as the north wind on the bents, Clean from the verge to tear you in my transit, Then boom triumphant of the scath behind! A regicide, a rex! It bursts again— Their shriek that whirrs and eddies like the cry Of sea-fowl at the base. Cries Come down to us; Yield yourself prisoner! Bothwell Ay, to be shut up As a big, precious relic! If these men Should act my vision on me, I would loose My thoughts out in a wolfish multitude; I would betray them. Re-enter Castellan Crookstan, muffle me, Push me along the passage; I am blind— Your boy there? O the mountains! I am safe! And yonder the wan water. Let us out. Exeunt Queen (Who has caught snatches of the talk below) Fidelity! But now he has no claim, No share in any regal attribute; He drops to the unsingled multitude Of craven rebels. And I stand alone, Full of great, mounting courage; in my veins The blood that buffets fortune and endures. I will go wander forth into the night, And breathe my freedom. I am free as air, As Dian in the woods. I wedded him By promises heretical and void As is his heart who leaves me. Out, away, I go, I go! The wife of Hepburn slips Into her boyish hose and doughty cloak To disappear for ever. In the cots Are faithful subjects, charitable hands: My people love their pity-dealing queen, The daughter of their goodman, whom they called King o' the Commons merrily. I wish Bad dreams had all such issue: I am light As when I danced upon the palace-floors In dearest France, and irresponsible As when I strayed at Inchmahome. My youth Rushes in front of memory; all my pain, My plight in fresh disguise, are smart as joy; And there is nature in me that persists In hoping, loving; for the rain and dew I cry, for seed-time and the harvest-fields: The dead, unsightly things that have been cast By alien forces on me presently Must disappear. I leap into my realm Without a thought—God speed me! Exit Scene V —Crichton Muir; a wild, marish country, lighted by glow-worms, in the distance a saddled horse The Queen enters, dressed as a cavalier, and throws herself on the grass Queen I have lost, Quite lost my way, and with it every grief. Ah, here is freedom, here is quietness; Myself's own mystery closes round my soul Once more, and I am healed. I have no prayer, Nor any hopes or fears. To penetrate Still further on, to learn more of this June, This deep, midsummer midnight! I have touched The roses, and have felt the fanning wind: There is a kingdom where these royalties Are more than faintly dreamed. Oh, if what stirs In sleep, what palpitates with blessedness, Would carry me away in trancèd arms! (She puts her hands through the turf) I have no mind for death. What gaiety There is across the banks—a showery track Of glow-worms; the whole grass is full of them, And on beyond they thicken toward the moor. I can be very wakeful with delight, And watch the change and flitting of these lamps, The passing and re-passing to and fro, A luminous, slow load. How heavily One drags behind, and now they all are gone. One, two—I cannot count them. (She sleeps) (Waking) Day-break—ho! The hills are built again, And yonder is a castle. God, it seems The sullen country that I saw before, As I had made an orbit in the dark, And come round to my starting. Silently The light is creeping through; from point to point It passes and gives judgment: on the verge The barren hills expose their solitude, The marsh yields up its rank and heavy pools, While at my feet these silky filaments (Gathering sedges) Shake their untarnished tufts athwart the wind. In this hard dawn I find no comforter; It is too just, it spreads impartially, Shooting no dazzling signature across The wide, accessible, untrodden ways. I cannot choose or wander any more, I can but bow me to my misery, And take the pensive journey of a spirit, That walks from hollow torture to its tomb, To clothe itself in flesh that shall receive, Foster, prolong, diversify its pangs. There is a tramp of footsteps. (Turning, she sees Bothwell close to her) Bothwell Marie!—What, You wanton! But you flitted for my sake Across the brae? Queen No matter—for we meet. Bothwell Ho, lad! This change of vesture almost might Win manhood to adopt you; yet, my faith! We have no room among our qualities For wild, exciting pallor, and such gaze As would make civil war within our sex, If once admitted . . . . Why, there is a change— Turn me your face!—there is a change beyond The youngster's cap about your wrung-up hair, The boots and spurs. I madden! If you mean To punish me you could not use me worse Than mumming in these clothes with face of sorrow, And climax of strange loveliness that makes me Half-dread you are a spirit in disguise, And mine no more. Queen Where are we, on what road? Bothwell She wanders still. Black Castle stands to left That hid me in my flight. Ah, you are changed! Queen A terrible perfection has been growing In every sense of good and pain I feel. No wonder I turn lovelier—I am young, Not adverse as the old are toward their griefs, But lithe to chastening. Bothwell Talk less foolishly. My Thespian, O my buskined love, this stage, This moor, is not for interludes. The foe May any moment seize us. I was sick, Short-tempered when we parted. Queen You are wrong, We did not say goodbye. Bothwell O pardon! Queen Whither Does foredoom take us? Bothwell Hasten to Dunbar With me: then are you safe. Queen Not to Dunbar! Bothwell Why, ’tis the only refuge. Queen (Apart) Back to Hell God's power dismisses lost ones on the day Of their accompt; back, back to Hell—Dunbar! Bothwell You speak with half a voice and hollowly. Come, you are not yourself and must be led; I sweep my arm around your shoulders, boy! I am the stronger man, and shall prevail If you entice my sinews into work. And yet the deepness of your eyes affrights, And is unlawful. I forbid the folly Which thus delays escape. Queen Yes, I must come; It is my sentence. Bothwell What, you are offended? Then let me kiss the frown away. Queen No, no! Shame not my venturous gait. Bothwell You shall no more Pause in a gleaming stupor, but enlinked Fly to your husband'e castle, and there pay The sweet embraces due to him. On oath, I will not plague your lips, my traveller, Till you have altered guise. Queen You do not well To take me to your sea-fort, with my clear Aboding that we go there to divide Who left it to be wedded: ’tis the end, A bare, unblest extreme. Bothwell The damps have entered Your health, the fiendful desolation driven Your wits into the moon.—You have not slung Your sword aright. As fair as beaten gold Your neck shines out above the heavy wrap; There 's no imperfect place in you, except This error of accoutrement. Queen Dunbar! Bothwell You shall not speak it on a burning pant. Its red towers are not answerable for The rare effects that bind us. By God's blood, We must put in for haven from revolt There where my cannon are, my guns, and strength. At last an army gathers. Queen Oh, to spend Warlike, not over-solitary hours! To toil, inspire, and marshal. Will you promise An army? Bothwell By my life, I will. Queen Lead on! There are affairs to settle by the sea: Waves welter and cry out, but I shall hear The press of faithful squadrons. (To Bothwell) Loose my neck, Then I will follow. Bothwell (Apart) She is changed. O fate, Re-make her into woman once again, For she is gone from underneath my hand. (Exeunt) Scene VI —Carberry Hill; the camp of the Lords: Lethington looks across the valley in the direction of the Queen's army on the opposite height Lethington Will it be thus, I wonder, hereafter: the borders of the great gulf ranged with ironical faces. Could the sheep and goats but front, would they not blink at one another like the unsound augurs of old? Sheep and goats, sheep and goats! A disastrous partition, for man is of his nature indivisible, and can have but one destiny. It is the misplacing that irks! What pleasure can I have among these precise Protestants, who see a street before their noses, whatsoe'er the pied landscape discover? How I pine for that rare, lyrical creature I have abjured! When they roused me from my rest in the city to come march against her to Musseburgh, I rubbed my eyes long, and lay listening to the blare of the trumpets, as it were in a stupor. May it be my portion some day from the housetops to proclaim what these men are, and to see them degraded one by one. For what I fainest would do is to have my mistress in estate, in person, in honour; and when these miscreants take her to their keeping, I doubt not I shall have to labour for her very life . . . Du Croc has passed to parley with her, but who can reason under this inexorable sun. Not to budge deserves a palm-branch. (To a soldier arranging a banner) At work, ho! And on the Sabbath made for man! I marvel at you. Come, unfurl your canvas. Soldier This banner, sir, is to flap before our army. Lethington Tut, my man, it will not pay to fight in this dazzle; we must stand still like cows in the heat. (Nodding, as the soldier unfurls the flag) Ay, it is pretty and most scriptural! We have here a marvellous sweet babe, pious as the infant Samuel, praying the voiceful air; and in the midst is murdered Abel under a green growing tree. But where is Cain? Here you should figure him, Lord Bothwell, in this corner, with his rumpled brow and villainous, hot face. See, good fellow, they are buying food yonder from the country people. Get to your dinner; I will watch the stuff. Soldier Surely, for his pieces will buy cheese.—That picture, sir, must make the harlot wince. Exit Lethington To eat and drink And be religious is all one to them; I have no superstition; when a man Is gross in sanctity it gives me qualms. I wonder is she sitting on the hill, Or speaking full of kindness to Du Croc, This tedious summer day. A gallant soul! And birds, they say, sing sweeter in the cage, For then they sing of freedom. I must wait A time to do her good. These fleecy clouds Of bosomed thunder dull at least the heat. Enter Morton Ho, Morton, do you answer to this charge? (Pointing to the banner) Morton Is it not bravely pictured? Thus heaven writes Across the walls of conscience; I would sooner Be burned alive than leave this infamous, Vile murder unavenged. My blood grows hot; God knows I share His hatreds. Riccio first, Then the limp Catholic, and now this pair Of married liars. Would that I saw them stretched Dead at my feet, like those two subtle ones Who thought upon the value of their land When bartering for their souls. I have been patient, The long, slow way God deals with his elect, Although He will avenge them speedily. Since Kirk o' Field I kept this orphan-babe Firm in my thoughts, and stand here now in arms To compass retribution. Lethington That shall fall On me, on you, on that frail innocence, The earl of Moray? Morton On the queen herself. We are but instruments in heaven's high hand. For better station we must cross the stream, And take the ridge of Cowsland where the sun Will not molest us. Grange is with the queen And there is talk of ending this affray By single combat of the duke with some Selected nobleman; but I will stripe The devil, if he dare to fight with us. Exit (Lethington lies down, pulls his cap over his brows and listens to the sky-larks) Lethington How sunnily they sing!—About their business In the deep blue. I give religion up, It is all controversy; but to flute One's happiness, get wings to it, and fly; Leaving the realm of question, to create; Listen, create and listen—in one's bosom An inexhaustive fount, and from the brain An ever finer conduit to the ear: That were felicity that, in the nest, The twitter of the young ones would not mar. If this rude canvas did not flap my face With such a stinging stroke, these battlefields, That give a statesman leisure in the midst Of march and counter-march for reverie, Were not without advantage. I will pen A new, rare counsel of perfection while Insurgent passions parley. (To soldier who re-enters) Fold it up! Exit soldier with banner Religion! thou wilt never scan her The way that brings To church, nor yet upon a banner Of kneeling kings: For know—religion is a manner Of touching things. Thou art the sage, and life the fable; Read what it saith; Keep but thy spirit firm and stable Above thy breath, And, dying, thou shalt be an able Critic of death. And so till the sundown settle all. Scene VII —Carberry Hill. The Queen's army about her; she wears a countrywoman's dress. Her horse is near. She speaks with Kircaldy of Grange Queen I cannot be so murderous in my soul To shed my people's blood; while I was sitting On yonder stone beneath the hawthorn-tree, I thought of every kind device to shelter My faithless subjects from their punishment. But I am dazed; the sun all afternoon Has streamed upon my head, I cannot hold Firm converse with myself, and seem to grow Confused as in a swoon. This long, slow day Labours with tangled issues. Grange I am come, Madam, at your request, and on my knees Attend your will. Queen I hear that friends of mine In parley with your leaders have declared Their wish for single combat. Grange To prevent The slaughter that you dread. Queen ’Tis very strange! They gave me to a husband, whom they now, Because I love not bloodshed, would destroy Before my eyes. Grange Have you so little trust In your good cause and his that you should look For death as God's award if he should fight? Queen Sir, he has borne his trial, and the voice Of law has called him pure. Grange I wish all men Believed the judgment. Queen We are much offended By any words dishonourably spoken That touch our husband's honour. Enter Bothwell Bothwell Is it I With whom they pick a quarrel? Let them say What harm I ever did them. I have injured Not one among them, but have simply wrought As they desired. I tell you, laird of Grange, ’Tis envy brings them to the field: they see My eminence and grieve. They never knew That fortune, like a woman, sits and waits Longing to feel her conqueror. I won By sudden rape, I handled destiny As if she were a prey. Queen You give no heed To present business. (Apart) As he rode along High-mounted, with the lion upon my banner, Flapping about his cheek, I loved him—now An evil coldness strikes me. Bothwell Give command, I am your common soldier, and your will The only motion in me. Queen You must fight, And prove before the armies your acquittal Was veritable innocence. Bothwell My sword Is ready, sir.—Marie, you gave your order More strictly than you need. Queen The time is short, The enemy impatient. Bothwell (To Grange) Step aside. (They converse.) Queen How dim it is about the woodland's edge; The twilight seems to rise up from the earth; I never felt so cheerless. I could wish To take a needle at my tapestry, And at an open window sit and sing; It would be less monotonous by far Than this uncertainty that stuns my head,— All the vague action that has circled me, And made me like a stranger to myself Hour after hour. Although the evening grows More intimate and nearer I can watch Our weary soldiers, parting from their ranks In search of food and drink; the army sunders In tired confusion. I shall let him fight, Though I refused this morning. I am hard, His fires have burnt me hard as in the oven The soft, responsive clay. He ever was To me a faithful subject, and my soul Was built upon his loyalty, until I found that as a lover he could do Stern treason, and could wrong me in such sort As turns affection marble. It is fearful To have this vile disease within the heart, This cold paralysis, to long for cure, Yet to remain inveterately dead Just where you once were loving and divine, And soft compassion pained you. Bothwell (To the Queen) All is settled. The laird of Grange would bid adieu. Queen God speed! I will receive the lords if they repent, And turn away my anger. Grange Our condition The duke of Orkney grants—that he should meet A peer, and prove his cause. Bothwell I will. Queen Adieu. Exit Grange Bothwell (Unsheathing his sword) It shines a confident, fine-tempered blade As ever did good work. You tremble, Marie, Yet not the wifely way. This pensive lip, These dreaming eyes! O lass, I wield the sword To keep you ever mine, to hold from foes My prize, my love, my crown. Before I smite And triumph, kiss me with warm mouth, and breathe Success! between the kisses. Queen Ha, I am Too tired and anxious to encourage you; And, James, you are so bravely made, so doughty, You need no pricking words. Turn, I will fasten Your scarf more firmly; you have ever loved The gayest colours, fie! Bothwell They are more royal, More wealthy than all others, have the front To capture sight. Well, these are perfect hands Knotting my plaid, but in an hour, I tell you, They will be busy with my corpse, if thus You send me forth to battle. Do you care That I should win, or are you so estranged You will give welcome to the laird of Grange If with soft manners he report me slain,— Curse him!—and lead you to a widowed throne? Queen James, if my love is dead, it is your hand Hath murdered it, and all that now is left Is a long night of mourning. Oh, I feel Stricken and hopeless as a mother bird Covering her callow brood when there's no warmth, No twitter in the nest; the use of loving Was over long ago. Bothwell The wanton birds Get them new mates. Queen The linnet, broken-winged, Dies in a bright-eyed silence ’neath the bush. Think not, if death should take you, any more There can be mirth in Mary Stuart's heart, But fond with her old fondness, she will build Her life upon some relic of the past, As many stately priories have been founded Over a heap of long-since mouldered bones. All will be recollection. Bothwell Must I fight For a mere shade?—Confound their trickery! They move their squadrons; I must hasten yonder Before they snatch advantage. Exit Queen (Looking anxiously over the field) Is it so? I will awake and reason, win his safety; And then—O God! there is another knot I must untie, release him from myself. (She hastily writes a message and gives it to a Soldier) Bear this to the encampment. Exit Soldier I must act For him—then take possession of my sole, Unflawed estate, my sovereignty, and draw Down slowly on base, unsuspecting heads Such retribution as God pays for wrongs Done to His honour; I will lift myself Among the kings and punish. A rare love Sustains me: wheresoe'er I lie to-night He will be safe, I shall not have a care. I think I shall sleep on through many days And nights just dreaming that I do not dream; There is no other comfort. Re-enter Grange Kircaldy, Hear my brief terms: if you are willing now To take me to your ranks I will return In single royalty, bespeaking mere Safe-conduct for my husband, no pursuit. Grange Most just conditions. Madam, you have won To-day a signal triumph. Re-enter Bothwell at a distance. Queen Leave me, Grange; While you make final parley with the lords I will convey my pleasure to the duke, And speed him from my presence. (Seeing Bothwell bidding an arquebusier aim at Grange) Haste, the guard About me is provoked at your delay, Repression, change of front. God's peace! they shoot Unless you leave the ground. Exit Grange (Angrily to Bothwell) You know he lies Beneath my great protection: would you slur My queenly faith, and ’gainst an embassy Level your lawless weapons? Bothwell A dull face Watched me away; the lights are burning now Athwart your lips and eyes. O Marie, Marie, I know that you are false; you have made terms To hand me to the headsman. Give the news! And so you never meant that I should fight, You have been busy fooling me all day, Wrecking and fooling. May you never know The agony of loving with such hate. (He covers his face with his hands, she moves toward him, then controls herself, turns back, and stands apart) Queen The steep and rending moment comes at last, Comes with the sunset. (To Bothwell) I have fixed my will; You cannot win the day now day is done. I am a queen, and must resume the rule, And heed the counsel of my subjects: therefore I pass across the valley to the lords, And you in safety ride back to Dunbar. ’Tis so I have determined. Bothwell Earth and sea! How dare you speak like this? Impossible, Exclusive voice, that smites like ugliness, As if a magic woman had been changed To dragon in a second. At Dunbar My walls were round you; now, in open air, You look out on that army of your foes, And my poor, melted ranks. Queen We must be brief. Imperial guidance in my nature draws me Over the valley: I must follow it, And part with you. Bothwell The impulse is a fool's! Those men are traitors, and their crime is greedy For its occasion. Love, return, return To yon siege-proof Dunbar, and I will fight To the last drop of blood to keep you mine; To-day I should have conquered, if the battle Had not been struck with paralytic sun. Queen Grange brings me pledge of loyalty. My lord, Where you have used me ill I have forgiven, And signed away your treason: if my realm Raise charges of another dye against you, With claim for scrutiny more liberal Than what acquitted you, I stand your help And your protection, until innocence Is reconfirmed. Bothwell I might as well be dead, A ghost in my despair. I find but ice, When I have reached the summit o' the world, And thought its poles were mine. Queen O James, I freeze, Because so much is dying in my heart Ere we can kiss and sever. Bothwell Come along, Break from this stagnant hill-side, where I feel As if the fates in yonder setting sky Prepared for us imprisonment. My swift, Free-tempered wife, come with me to Dunbar; I will defend you, while beneath your feet Will sway the chainless waters. I implore, Not as the consort of your sovereignty, But as a man who loves you. Do not sweep The great brim of your hat across your face, And leave me but that crystal ball, your chin, For divination of my future lot; Grant me your eyes. Queen We have short space of time, Short moments; Grange is coming from the camp. Bothwell You often longed to leave your kingdom, sail For liberty away; to greet the foam By loosened hair on wind-washed cheek; to slip Within revolving, spheral influence, To wayfare through the world. We will escape Aboard— Queen Ah, let me think of you at sea; Have joy in taming what you cannot tame, The pliant, dauntless swell. Bothwell In hearing of The ocean's sough, we yet can hold Dunbar— Those stout and ruddy stones that dye with red The swinging tides. Be dominant, recall Black Agnes and her feminine defence, My Amazon!—You will not turn your eyes, Your indiscoverable, watchful eyes; I know they weep within the orbs, while mine Are wet with anguish. Queen (Half-apart) How the worst of wrong Is the new wrong one does to set it right! Even God, our God, must make a hell to chasten The evil He permits: O heart, this voice Will break me into ruin! Bothwell For one night Turn back to refuge,—that the Hamiltons May find us with their strength. You ever loved A cool, dawn-ended gallop. Queen For my crown I fled this way these eighteen months long passed. Bothwell For that fly now. Queen Grange renders me allegiance, An oath of loyalty. Bothwell The very grain And compass of my nature questions you— Will you not come? Queen I cannot. Bothwell This wild stroke Dashes my hopes out. (He casts himself down on a rock. Grange rides up; the Queen meets him) Grange Let me kiss your hand; The lords, your honest subjects, welcome you Whom they alone obey. (She bows and motions Grange to go further off; then returns to Bothwell, who springs fiercely up) Queen We must not think, No, not even speak . . . but kiss. Bothwell I will not come To trial, if invited. I have more Of fiendish pride than that. Shall murderer Be judged by fellow-murderer? Ha, ha! That were fine reformation in the state; I'm for old ways of justice anyhow. Look here, my lady! (Holding out a parchment) Queen How his swollen, white lip Is terrible!—Explain! Bothwell I let you choose The company you are so sweet upon. Here in this bond are stainless signatures, Morton and Moray, Lethington, Argyle. See, see! And for the purpose—what is that? The king's destruction. Queen And you hold the bond, Then . . . . Bothwell You shall make no blab. I throw myself Upon your honour in extreme attempt To save you. In the mitigating light Of your sweet face, and kneeling as to one White in the heavens, I now confess my guilt; Yet though you walked aloft so clean and proud, It was your will that wrought at Kirk o' Field, Your will that made me a black, blasted devil: You have not a frank, amorous face for naught— To watch the change of climate on your cheek Is all-sufficing. Do not turn from me, As if a statue took possession of Your breathing frame. O Marie! I am lone As Adam on the sod before his bliss, His woman girt him, if you turn away. All I have done is horror in my nights, And follows day like pestilence—all, all, Was done for you: demoniac and lovely You came to rule me; do not start; I plead That when you entered me you were no more The queen, the lady—but a temptress love; It was no fault of yours; we cannot tell How we drop down in other natures. I Was born half-wizard on my southern hills. A bandit like my sires, a worshipper Of rich, exalted women . . . and you set My elements a-flame. Such wrought desire Will murder, ravish, spell-bind. I shall grasp Your wrists until you soften. Queen Loose! Farewell! There is no circle of God's ire for pain Like this horizon; yet I stay alive— The wonder breath provides for. And this bond . . ? Bothwell Keep it with care, it is my testament; And I am for the whirlwind—for no bonds Of marriage or of fellowship henceforth. The falsehood of the universe is gathered In vow and pact; goodbye to them, goodbye To you! There stands my horse, there are my towers! You know your men, you know how merrily They will receive you. We shall never meet Again. At least I catch your hand and kiss Where Grange has kissed the finger that I ringed. Death, I must go! Queen We write to you our will. (He leaps on his horse) Be strong in me, my terror; hold me up From where a gulf has opened! My whole life Will see that form a' riding to the glare Of far-off sunset. (Dropping the parchment) Laird of Grange, I come. We have what is the calm of sovereignty, That faith it has in subjects. Grange See, the lords Advance their arms and ranks to compass you, As with a land's embrace. (He stoops and snatches the bond up) Enter Morton, Argyle, Lords, and Army Queen (To Morton) We had no will To shed enfiefèd blood; and therefore freely Join you, our earls and nobles, that together We may unravel discord and present To foreign gaze accompt. Morton (Kneeling) You find yourself Where you pertain, among your lieges, madam, And we will hold you fast! Cry Burn her! Queen (Apart) His lips Are far away. What is it that is thrown? I am not wholly queen above myself; I have unsettling fancies. Lead me on, Deep to your trusty centre. There are smiles, Though I am over spent. When I have rested I shall breathe olden life in all I do. Ah, my good people! . . . . . . Mercy, what is this! Why flap this buried man? Would I had never Seen him before! I know he looked like that— So long in his long coffin—and the child! I've clapped those chubby fingers in my palm That point to point beg vengeance of the Lord; For once I heard a little, lonesome cry, And then a voice that said I had a son. Cries The murderess, ha, the murderess! Queen I would rather Hear of the evil that I have not done, Than do the evil of which nought is heard, So greater far is my respect for God— Whom no man can deceive, who sees the drop Of light at the well-bottom—than for man, The misconceiving witness. I have never Worn mask to God; before Him I could lie As a white effigy, and let Him probe Through to my soul. I have great need of pardon For sins of which you cannot take account. Cries Burn her—the witch, the harlot! Queen (Wildly) Is it hell? Why this is Morton, Grange is striking out To stop the spume. Look yonder, noblemen, Strike down that standard . . . . Will it never cease To write its libel on yon wall of sky? Have I not made an edict that no words Shall be set up for scandal morn or eve? Are queenship and executive gone too? Have they been ravished from me? I am sinking To impotence amid such scrannel whirr As ship whose helm and birthright government Are taken by a sea. How strange and deep! Kneel down, repeat your oaths of fealty—Down, Down! (She faints) Morton We have worked most manifest detection. Press on, for darkness loads the west, a rabble Is waiting to give cheer of Christian voices To this high-browed adulteress, in the town. Her hat falls off—St. Bride! her clothes are short; Her face is blurred with evil and with tire; She looks a thing to put away; and shortly There must be talk of prison or of death For her, and for her lawful son the honours She trails into the dust. Her shameless eyes Open, grow hot, dilate: she raves and throbs. Queen (In frenzy) God speed him over seas, my lawless love; God stop that small, defaming, pious cry, Blazon the deed of Kirk o' Field as just, And set the great Lord Warden o'er the world! Would we not judge together, he and I, Uproot these trembling, vile hypocrisies, Recall untempered love from banishment, And make a progress down the Canongate, Constraining all men to our gaiety! How vile was our false wedding, vile the banns, The ritual—dear the rape, the ride along The High Street with my king at bridle rein; So should Queen Mary flaunt upon a banner Subject, subjecting. I would follow him In my wild, woman-scanted Highland dress Across the world. Has he yet reached the shore, My rough free-booter? Who craves audience now? I choke with wrath; these scalding, vengeful tears, Breed in my head; they cast a torchlight glare Athwart the past, and fall in fiery sparks. We pay for truth by madness. Give your hand, Morton, and your's, Argyle, to squeeze in mine: We have been fellows in deception, boldly Wearing false hearts; but when I am a queen Again, the axe shall split them into ruin, And I shall swing the axe, for I am saved Through foam and horror. I have still myself To set within myself and crown, the true Religion to give faith to, a lost love To weep for through the long captivity Of unenjoying years, and the whole earth To gain, when I have repossessed my soul. NOTE The title of this play is taken, with his consent, from the following passage of Mr. Pater's Essay on Rossetti in his Volume of Appreciations, (page 240):— Old Scotch history, perhaps beyond any other, is strong in the matter of heroic and vehement hatreds and love, the tragic Mary herself being but the perfect blossom of them. To him, as to the friends who have aided me in research and by suggestion, my thanks are proffered. My indebtedness to historians, living and dead, it would be impossible to acknowledge: but of Mr. Skelton's charming and animated work, Maitland of Lethington, I desire to make special mention. The Lethington of these pages owes his existence to Mr. Skelton's portrait; at the same time, since many imaginings have been added to the historic delineation, I must be held wholly responsible for my dramatic treatment of Mary Stuart's minister.</field>
