      <field name="fulltext">“As half in shade, and half in sun, This world along its course advances, May that side the Sun's upon Be all that shall ever meet thy glances!” Moore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is another topic which, I think, must force itself on your attention before long; I mean the condition of the people of England.” Lord John Russell, at the close of the Session of 1844. “There is too little communication between classes in this country. We want, if not the feeling, at least the expression, of more sympathy on the part of the rich towards the poor; and more personal intercourse between them.” Speech of the Hon. Sidney Herbert, at the Salisbury Diocesan Church Meeting, Nov. 17, 1842. “If the poor had more justice, they would need less charity.” Jeremy Bentham. “Men who hate the whole theory of Political Economy with a hatred unspeakable, and consider it a most utter and iniquitous delusion, will yet reserve one clause. The one jewel in this Toad's head is the rule of not giving except for an exact equivalent.” Times Newspaper, Nov. 13, 1844. “A high class, without duties to do, is like a tree planted on precipices, from the roots of which all the earth has been crumbling.” Past and Present, by Thomas Carlyle. “Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas Regumque turres.” Horace, Ode iv. “Æqua tellus Pauperi recluditur Regumque Pueris;”? Horace, Ode xviii. TO MY BROTHER, RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, This Poem is Dedicated, IN THE HOPE AND BELIEF THAT WE THINK ALIKE ON ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TOPICS TO WHICH IT REFERS; IN MEMORY OF MANY EARNEST CONVERSATIONS HELD WITH HIM ON THOSE SUBJECTS; AND IN TOKEN OF SYMPATHY WITH HIS UNWEARIED EFFORTS TO AMELIORATE THE CONDITION AND PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF ALL WHO ARE IN ANY WAY DEPENDENT UPON HIM. [Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth] OPENING. THE ARGUMENT. The Welcome Given, and Rejoicing Over, the Birth of a Child—A Degree of Welcome for All, however Poor or Unfortunate, on their First Entrance into Life—The Exceptions Unnatural—Infanticide a Madness—The Peculiar Welcome of “The Child of the Islands,” with Gladness, Thanksgiving, and Prayer—Even the Earth appears to Welcome Him. I Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth, What joy is welcomed like a new-born child? What life so wretched, but that, at its birth, Some heart rejoiced—some lip in gladness smiled? The poorest cottager, by love beguiled, Greets his new burden with a kindly eye; He knows his son must toil as he hath toiled; But cheerful Labour, standing patient by, Laughs at the warning shade of meagre Poverty! II The pettiest squire who holds his bounded sway In some far nook of England's fertile ground, Keeps a high jubilee the happy day Which bids the bonfires blaze, the joybells sound, And the small tenantry come flocking round, While the old steward triumphs to declare The mother's suffering hour with safety crowned; And then, with reverent eyes, and grey locks bare, Falters—“God bless the Boy!” his Master's Son and Heir! III The youthful couple, whose sad marriage-vow Received no sanction from a haughty sire, Feel, as they gaze upon their infant's brow, The angel, Hope, whose strong wings never tire— Once more their long discouraged hearts inspire; Surely, they deem, the smiles of that young face, Shall thaw the frost of his relentless ire! Homeward they turn in thought; old scenes retrace; And, weeping, yearn to meet his reconciled embrace! IV Yea, for this cause, even Shame will step aside, And cease to bow the head and wring the heart; For she that is a mother, but no bride, Out of her lethargy of woe will start, Pluck from her side that sorrow's barbéd dart, And, now no longer faint and full of fears, Plan how she best protection may impart To the lone course of those forsaken years Which dawn in Love's warm light, though doomed to set in tears! V The dread exception—when some frenzied mind, Crushed by the weight of unforeseen distress, Grows to that feeble creature all unkind, And Nature's sweetest fount, through grief's excess, Is strangely turned to gall and bitterness; When the deserted babe is left to lie, Far from the woeful mother's lost caress, Under the broad cope of the solemn sky, Or, by her shuddering hands, forlorn, condemned to die: VI Monstrous, unnatural, and mad, is deemed, However dark life's Future glooms in view, An act no sane and settled heart had dreamed, Even in extremity of want to do! And surely we should hold that verdict true, Who, for men's lives—not children's—have thought fit (Though high those lives were valued at their due) The savage thirst of murder to acquit, By stamping cold revenge an error of crazed wit! VII She—after pains unpitied, unrelieved— Sate in her weakness, lonely and forlorn, Listening bewildered, while the wind that grieved, Mocked the starved wailing of her newly born; Racking her brain from weary night till morn For friendly names, and chance of present aid; Till, as she felt how this world's crushing scorn, Passing the Tempter, rests on the Betrayed,— Hopeless, she flung to Death the life her sin had made! VIII Yes, deem her mad! for holy is the sway Of that mysterious sense which bids us bend Toward the young souls new clothed in helpless clay,— Fragile beginnings of a mighty end,— Angels unwinged,—which human care must tend Till they can tread the world's rough path alone, Serve for themselves, or in themselves offend. But God o'erlooketh all from His high throne, And sees, with eyes benign, their weakness—and our own! IX Therefore we pray for them, when sunset brings Rest to the joyous heart and shining head; When flowers are closed, and birds fold up their wings, And watchful mothers pass each cradle-bed With hushed soft steps, and earnest eyes that shed Tears far more glad than smiling! Yea, all day We bless them; while, by guileless pleasure led, Their voices echo in their gleesome play, And their whole careless souls are making holiday. X And if, by Heaven's inscrutable decree, Death calls, and human skill be vain to save; If the bright child that clambered to our knee, Be coldly buried in the silent grave; Oh! with what wild lament we moan and rave! What passionate tears fall down in ceaseless shower! There lies Perfection!—there, of all life gave— The bud that would have proved the sweetest flower That ever woke to bloom within an earthly bower! XI For, in this hope our intellects abjure All reason—all experience—and forego Belief in that which only is secure, Our natural chance and share of human woe. The father pitieth David's heart-struck blow, But for himself, such augury defies: No future Absalom his love can know; No pride, no passion, no rebellion lies In the unsullied depth of those delightful eyes! XII Their innocent faces open like a book, Full of sweet prophecies of coming good; And we who pore thereon with loving look, Read what we most desire, not what we should; Even that which suits our own Ambition's mood. The Scholar sees distinction promised there,— The Soldier, laurels in the field of blood,— The Merchant, venturous skill and trading fair,— None read of broken hope—of failure—of despair! XIII Nor ever can a Parent's gaze behold Defect of Nature, as a Stranger doth; For these (with judgment true, severe, and cold) Mark the ungainly step of heavy Sloth,— Coarseness of features,—tempers quickly wroth: But those, with dazzled hearts such errors spy, (A halo of indulgence circling both:) The plainest child a stranger passes by, Shews lovely to the sight of some enamoured eye! XIV The Mother looketh from her latticed pane— Her Children's voices echoing sweet and clear: With merry leap and bound her side they gain, Offering their wild field-flow'rets: all are dear, Yet still she listens with an absent ear: For, while the strong and lovely round her press, A halt uneven step sounds drawing near: And all she leaves, that crippled child to bless, Folding him to her heart, with cherishing caress. XV Yea, where the Soul denies illumined grace, (The last, the worst, the fatallest defect;) She, gazing earnest in that idiot face, Thinks she perceives a dawn of Intellect: And, year by year, continues to expect What Time shall never bring, ere Life be flown: Still loving, hoping,—patient, though deject,— Watching those eyes that answer not her own,— Near him,—and yet how far! with him,—but still alone! XVI Want of attraction this love cannot mar: Years of Rebellion cannot blot it out: The Prodigal, returning from afar, Still finds a welcome, giv'n with song and shout! The Father's hand, without reproach or doubt, Clasps his,—who caused them all such bitter fears: The Mother's arms encircle him about: That long dark course of alienated years, Marked only by a burst of reconciling tears! XVII Child of the Islands! if the watch of love To even the meanest of these fates belong, What shall thine be, whose lot is far above All other fortunes woven in my song? To guard thy head from danger and from wrong, What countless voices lift their prayers to Heaven! Those, whose own loves crowd round, (a happy throng!) Those, for whom Death the blessed tie hath riven; And those to whose scathed age no verdant branch is given! XVIII There's not a noble matron in the land, Whose christen'd heir in gorgeous robes is drest,— There's not a cottage mother, whose fond hand Rocks the low cradle of her darling's rest,— By whom thou art not thought upon and blest! Blest for thyself, and for her lineage high Who lull'd thee on her young maternal breast; The Queenly Lady, with the clear blue eye, Through whom thou claimest love, and sharest loyalty! XIX They pray for thee, fair child, in Gothic piles, Where the full organ's deep reverberate sound Rolls echoing through the dim cathedral aisles, Bidding the heart with inward rapture bound, While the bent knee sinks trembling to the ground. Till, at the signal of some well-known word, The white-robed choristers rise circling round; Mingling clear voices with divine accord, In Hallelujahs loud, that magnify the Lord! XX They pray for thee in many a village church, Deep in the shade of its sequester'd dell, Where, scarcely heard beyond the lowly porch, More simple hymns of praise less loudly swell; Oft led by some fair form,—remember'd well In after years among the grateful poor— Whose lot it is in lordly halls to dwell, Thence issuing forth to seek the cotter's door, Or tread with gentle feet the sanded schoolhouse floor. XXI They pray for thee, in floating barks that cleave Their compass-guided path along the sea; While through the topmast shrouds the keen winds grieve, As through the branches of some giant tree; And the surf sparkles in the vessel's lee. Far from thine Albion's cliffs and native home, Each crew of loyal mariners may be, But, mingling with the dash of Ocean's foam, That prayer shall rise, where'er their trackless course they roam. XXII And where, all newly on some foreign soil Transplanted from the o'erpeopled Fatherland, (Where hardy enterprise and honest toil Avail'd them not) the Emigrant's thin band, Gather'd for English worship, sadly stand; Repressing wandering thoughts, which vainly crave The Sabbath clasp of some familiar hand, Or yearn to pass the intervening wave And wet with Memory's tears some daisy-tufted grave:— XXIII There, even there, thy name is not forgot— Child of the land where they were children too! Though sever'd ties and exile be their lot, And Fortune now with different aspect woo,— Still to their country and religion true, From them the Indian learns, in broken phrase, To worship Heaven as his converters do; Simply he joins their forms of prayer and praise, And, in Thy native tongue, pleads for Thy valued days. XXIV Yea, even Earth, the dumb and beautiful, Would seem to bid Thee welcome—in her way; Since from her bosom thou shalt only cull, Choice flowers and fruits, from blossom and from spray. Spring—Summer—Autumn—Winter—day by day, Above thy head in mystery shall brood; And every phase of glory or decay, And every shift of Nature's changeful mood, To thee shall only bring variety of good! XXV No insufficient harvest's poverty, One grain of plenty from thy store can take; No burning drought that leaves green meadows dry, And parches all the fertile land, shall make The fountains fail, where thou thy thirst shalt slake! The hardest winter that can ever bind River, and running rill, and heaving lake, With its depressing chain of ice, shall find An atmosphere round thee, warm as the summer wind! XXVI From woes which deep privations must involve, Set in luxurious comfort far aloof, Thou shalt behold the vanishing snow dissolve, From the high window and the shelter'd roof; Or, while around thee, webs of richest woof On gilded pillars hang in many a fold; Read, in wise books, writ down for thy behoof, (Sounding like fables in the days of old!) What meaner men endure from want and pinching cold. XXVII Oh, since this is, and must be, by a law Of God's own holy making, shall there not Fall on thy heart a deep, reflecting awe, When thou shalt contemplate the adverse lot Of those by men, but not by Heaven, forgot? Bend to the lowly in their world of care; Think, in thy Palace, of the labourer's cot; And justify the still unequal share By all thy power to aid, and willingness to spare! SPRING. THE ARGUMENT. The Delights of Spring—Its Value to those who seldom taste its Pleasures—The Sempstress—The Trapper in the Mines—The Weaver at his Loom—The Lady of Fashion—Hyde Park at Intervals—The Serpentine—Suicide—Tyburn Gate and Tyburn Gallows—The Sleep of the Homeless Wanderer in the Lounge of Idlers—“The Child of the Islands”—His Share of what Spring can Give—The Inventions of Man's Genius—Invention the Spring of Human Intellect—Artist-Life—The Duty of Encouragement to Genius in Obscurity. I What shalt Thou know of Spring? A verdant crown Of young boughs waving o'er thy blooming head: White tufted Guelder-roses, showering down A fairy snow-path where thy footsteps tread: Fragrance and balm,—which purple violets shed: Wild-birds,—sweet warbling in commingled song: Brooklets,—thin murmuring down their pebbly bed; Or more abundant rivers,—swept along With shoals of tiny fish, in many a silver throng! II To Thee shall be unknown that weary pain, The feverish thirsting for a breath of air,— Which chokes the heart of those who sigh in vain For respite, in their round of toil and care: Who never gaze on Nature fresh and fair, Nor in sweet leisure wile an hour away; But, like caged creatures, sullenly despair, As day monotonously follows day, Till youth wears on to age, and strength to faint decay. III A feeble girl sits working all alone! A ruined Farmer's orphan; pale and weak; Her early home to wealthier strangers gone, No rural beauty lingers on her cheek; Her woe-worn looks a woeful heart bespeak; Though in her dull, and rarely lifted eye, (Whose glances nothing hope, and nothing seek,) Those who have time for pity, might descry A thousand shattered gleams of merriment gone by! IV Her window-sill some sickly plants adorn, (Poor links to memories sweet of Nature's green!) There to the City's smoke-polluted morn The primrose lifts its leaves, with buds between, 'Minished and faint, as though their life had been Nipped by long pining and obscure regret; Torn from the sunny bank where erst were seen Lovely and meek companions, thickly set,— The cowslip, rich in scent, and humble violet! V Too fanciful! the plant but pines, like her, For purer air; for sunbeams warm and kind; Th' enlivening joy of nature's busy stir, The rural freedom, long since left behind! For the fresh woodlands,—for the summer wind,— The open fields with perfumed clover spread;— The hazel copse,—whose branches intertwined Made natural bow'rs and arches overhead, With many a narrow path, where only two could tread. VI Never, oh! never more, shall these afford Her stifled heart their innocent delight! Never, oh! never more, the rich accord Of feathered songsters make her morning bright! Earning scant bread, that finds no appetite, The sapless life she toils for, lingers on; And when at length it sinks in dreary night, A shallow, careless grave is dug,—where none Come round to bless her rest, whose ceaseless tasks are done! VII And now, the devious threads her simple skill Wove in a quaint device and flowery line, Adorn some happier maid, whose wayward will Was struck with wishing for the fair design: Some “curléd darling” of a lordly line, Whose blooming cheek, through veils of texture rare, Mantling with youth's warm blood is seen to shine; While her light garments, draped with modest care, Soft as a dove's white wings, float on the breezy air. VIII Oh, there is need for permanent belief In the All-Equal World of Joy to come! Need for such solace to the restless grief And heavy troubles of our earthly home! Else might our wandering reason blindly roam, And ask, with all a heathen's discontent, Why Joy's bright cup for some should sparkling foam, While others, not less worthy, still lament, And find the cup of tears the only portion sent! IX But for the Christian's hope, how hard, how cold, How bitterly unjust, our lot would seem! How purposeless and sad, to young and old! How like the struggles of a torturing dream, When ghastly midnight bids us strive and scream! All fades—all fleets—of which our hearts grow fond; Pain presses on us to the last extreme,— When lo! the dawn upriseth, clear beyond, And, radiant from the East, forbids us to despond. X And many a crippled child, and aged man, And withered crone, who once saw “better days,” With just enough of intellect to scan This gracious truth; uncheered by human praise, Patient plods through the thorn-encumbered ways: Oh, trust God counts the hours through which they sigh, While His green Spring eludes their suffering gaze, And flowers along Earth's spangled bosom lie, Whose barren bloom, for them, must unenjoyed pass by! XI So lives the little Trapper underground; No glittering sunshine streaks the oozy wall; Not e'en a lamp's cold glimmer shineth round Where he must sit (through summer days and all, While in warm upper air the cuckoos call,) For ever listening at the weary gate Where echoes of the unseen footsteps fall. Early he comes, and lingers long and late, With savage men, whose blows his misery aggravate. XII Yet sometimes, (for the heart of childhood is A thing so pregnant with joy's blessed sun, That all the dismal gloom that round him lies Can scarce suffice to bid its rays begone) In lieu of vain complaint, or peevish moan, A feeble song the passing hour will mark! Poor little nightingale! that sing'st alone, Thy cage is very low, and bitter dark; But God hears thee, who hears the glad upsoaring lark. XIII God seeth thee, who sees the prosperous proud Into the sunshine of their joy go forth: God marks thee, weak one, in the human crowd, And judgeth all thy grief, (as all their mirth,) Bird with the broken wing that trails on earth! His angels watch thee, if none watch beside, As faithfully—despite thy lowly birth— As the child-royal of the queenly bride, Or our belief is vain in Christ the Crucified! XIV In Christ! who made young children's guileless lives The cherished objects of His love and care; Who bade each sinner that for pardon strives, Low, at Heaven's feet, a child-like heart lay bare; Opening the world's great universal prayer With these meek words: “Our Father!” Strange, that we The common blessings of His earth and air Deny to those who, circling round His knee, Embraced, in mortal life, His immortality! XV Those “common blessings!” In this chequered scene How scant the gratitude we shew to God! Is it, in truth, a privilege so mean To wander with free footsteps o'er the sod, See various blossoms paint the valley clod, And all things into teeming beauty burst?— A miracle as great as Aaron's rod, But that our senses, into dulness nurst, Recurring Custom still with Apathy hath curst. XVI They who have rarest joy, know Joy's true measure; They who most suffer, value Suffering's pause; They who but seldom taste the simplest pleasure, Kneel oftenest to the Giver and the Cause. Heavy the curtains feasting Luxury draws, To hide the sunset and the silver night; While humbler hearts, when Care no longer gnaws, And some rare holiday permits delight, Lingering, with love would watch that earth-enchanting sight. XVII So sits the pallid weaver at his loom, Copying the wreaths the artist-pencil drew; In the dull confines of his cheerless room Glisten those tints of rich and living hue. The air is sweet, the grass is fresh with dew, And feverish aches are throbbing in his veins, But his are work-day Springs, and Summers too; And if he quit his loom, he leaves his gains— That gorgeous, glistering silk, designed with so much pains! XVIII It shall be purchased as a robe of state By some great lady, when his toil is done; While on her will obsequious shopmen wait, To shift its radiance in the flattering sun: And as she, listless, eyes its beauty, none Her brow shall darken, or her smile shall shade, By a strange story—yet a common one— Of tears that fell (but not on her brocade,) And misery weakly borne while it was slowly made. XIX For while that silk the weaver's time beguiled, His wife lay groaning on her narrow bed, The suffering mother of a new-born child, Without a cradle for its weakly head, Or future certainty of coarsest bread; Nor, in that hour of Nature's sore affright, A fire, or meal that either might be fed; So, through the pauses of the dreadful night, Patient they lay, and longed for morning's blessed light. XX Not patient—no; I over-rate his strength Who listened to the infant's wailing cry, And mother's weary moan, until at length He gave them echo with a broken sigh! Daylight was dawning, and the loom stood nigh: He looked on it, as though he would discern If there was light enough to labour by. What made his heart's-blood leap, and sink, in turn? What, in that cold gloom caused his pallid cheek to burn? XXI What made him rise, with wild and sudden start? Alas! the poor are weak, when they are tried! (Can the rich say, that they, with steadfast heart, Have all temptations constantly defied?) He counts the value of that robe of pride; And while the dawn clears up, that ushers in His child's first morn on life's uncertain tide, He keeps its birthday with a deed of sin, And pawns his master's silk, bread for his wife to win. XXII Let none excuse the deed, for it was wrong:— And since 'twas ruin to the wretch employed, No doubt the hour's despair was wild and strong Which left that loom of silken splendours void: Let Virtue trust their meal was unenjoyed, Eaten in trembling, drenched with bitterness,— And that the faint uncertain hope which buoyed His heart awhile, to hide his guilt's excess, And get that silk redeemed, was vain, from his distress: XXIII So that true Justice might pursue her course; And the silk, finished by “a different hand,” Might in good time (delayed awhile perforce) Be brought to clothe that lady of the land Whom I behold as in a vision stand. Lo! in my vision, on its folds are laid The turquoise-circled fingers of her hand; While by herself, and her attendant maid, Its texture, soft and rich, is smiled on and surveyed. XXIV Indifferent to her, the heavy cost Of that rich robe, first pawned for one poor meal; She that now wears it, and her lord, may boast No payment made,—yet none dare say they steal! No, not if future reckoning-hours reveal Debts the encumbered heir can never pay; But whose dishonest weight his heart shall feel Through many a restless night and bitter day, Hearing what cheated men of the bad dead will say. XXV Onward she moves, in Fashion's magic glass, Half-strut, half-swim, she slowly saunters by: A self-delighting, delicate, pampered mass Of flesh indulged in every luxury Folly can crave, or riches can supply: Spangled with diamonds—head, and breast, and zone, Scorn lighting up her else most vacant eye, Careless of all conditions but her own, She sweeps that stuff along, to curtsey to the throne. XXVI That dumb woof tells no story! Silent droops The gorgeous train, voluminously wide; And while the lady's knee a moment stoops (Mocking her secret heart, which swells with pride,) No ragged shadow follows at her side Into that royal presence, where her claim To be admitted, is to be allied To wealth, and station, and a titled name,— No warning voice is heard to supplicate or blame. XXVII Nor,—since by giving working hands employ, Her very vanity must help their need Whom, in her life of cold ungenerous joy, She never learned to pity or to heed,— Would sentence harsh from thoughtful minds proceed; But that the poor man, dazzled, sees encroach False lights upon his pathway, which mislead Those who the subject of his wrongs would broach, Till Rank a bye-word seems,—and Riches a reproach. XXVIII How oft some friendly voice shall vainly speak The sound true lessons of Life's holier school;— How much of wholesome influence prove weak, Because one tinselled, gaudy, selfish fool, Hath made the exception seem the practiced rule! In Luxury, so prodigal of show,— In Charity, so wary and so cool,— That wealth appeared the poor man's open foe, And all, of high estate, this language to avow:— XXIX “A life of self-indulgence is for Us, “A life of self-denial is for them; “For Us the streets, broad-built and populous, “For them, unhealthy corners, garrets dim, “And cellars where the water-rat may swim! “For Us, green paths refreshed by frequent rain, “For them, dark alleys where the dust lies grim! “Not doomed by Us to this appointed pain,— “God made us, Rich and Poor—of what do these complain?” XXX Of what? Oh! not of Heaven's great law of old, That brightest light must fall by deepest shade; Not that they wander hungry, gaunt, and cold, While others in smooth splendours are arrayed; Not that from gardens where they would have strayed You shut them out, as though a miser's gem Lay in the crystal stream or emerald glade, Which they would filch from Nature's diadem; But that you keep no thought, no memory of them. XXXI That, being gleaners in the world's large field (And knowing well they never can be more,) Those unto whom the fertile earth must yield Her increase, will not stand like him of yore, Large-hearted Boaz, on his threshing-floor, Watching that weak ones starve not on their ground. How many sills might frame a beggar's door, For any love, or help, or pity found, In rich men's hearts and homes, to help the needy round! XXXII Meanwhile, enjoy your Walks, your Parks, your Drives, Heirs of Creation's fruits, this world's select! Bask in the sunshine of your idle lives, And teach your poorer brother to expect Nor share, nor help! Rouse up the fierce-toned sect To grudge him e'en the breeze that once a-week Might make him feel less weary and deject; And stand, untouched, to see how thankful-meek He walks that day, his child close nestling at his cheek. XXXIII Compel him to your creed; force him to think; Cut down his Sabbath to a day of rest Such as the beasts enjoy,—to eat, and drink, And drone away his time, by sleep opprest:— But let “My lady” send, at her behest, A dozen different servants to prepare, Grooms, coachmen, footmen, in her livery drest, And shining horses, fed with punctual care, To whirl her to Hyde Park, that she may “take the air.” XXXIV Yet, even with her, we well might moralise; (No place too gay, if so the heart incline!) For dark the Seal of Death and Judgment lies Upon thy rippling waters, Serpentine! Day after day, drawn up in linkèd line, Your lounging beauties smile on idle men, Where Suicides have braved the Will Divine, Watched the calm flood that lay beneath their ken, Dashed into seeming peace, and never rose again! XXXV There, on the pathway where the well-groomed steed Restlessly paws the earth, alarmed and shy; While his enamoured rider nought can heed Save the soft glance of some love-lighted eye; There, they dragged out the wretch who came to die There was he laid—stiff, stark, and motionless, And searched for written signs to notify What pang had driv'n him to such sore excess, And who should weep his loss, and pity his distress! XXXVI Cross from that death-pond to the farther side, Where fewer loiterers wander to and fro, There,—buried under London's modern pride, And ranges of white buildings,—long ago Stood Tyburn Gate and gallows! Scenes of woe, Bitter, heart-rending, have been acted here; While, as he swung in stifling horrid throe, Hoarse echoes smote the dying felon's ear, Of yells from fellow-men, triumphant in his fear! XXXVII Not always thus. At times a Mother knelt, And blest the wretch who perished for his crime; Or a young wife bowed down her head, and felt Her little son an orphan from that time; Or some poor frantic girl, whose love sublime In the coarse highway robber could but see Her heart's ideal, heard Death's sullen chime Shivering and weeping on her fainting knee, And mourned for him who hung high on the gallows-tree. XXXVIII Nowhere more deeply stamped the trace of gloom Than in this light haunt of the herding town; Marks of the world's Forgotten Ones, on whom The eye of God for ever looketh down, Still pitiful, above the human frown, As Glory o'er the Dark! Earth's mercy tires! But Heaven hath stored a mercy of its own, Watching the feet that tread among the briars, And guiding fearful eyes, when fainter light expires. XXXIX Yet no such serious thoughts their minds employ, Who lounge and wander 'neath the sunshine bright, But how to turn their idleness to joy, Their weariness to pleasure and delight; How best with the ennui of life to fight With operas, plays, assemblies, routs, and balls— The morning passed in planning for the night Feastings and dancings in their lighted halls; And still, as old ones fade, some newer pleasure calls. XL Betwixt the deathly stream and Tyburn Gate Stand withered trees, whose sapless boughs have seen Beauties whose memory now is out of date, And lovers, on whose graves the moss is green! While Spring, for ever fresh, with smile serene, Woke up grey Time, and drest his scythe with flowers, And flashed sweet light the tender leaves between, And bid the wild-bird carol in the bowers, Year after year the same, with glad returning hours. XLI Oh, those old trees! what see they when the beam Falls on blue waters from the bluer sky? When young Hope whispers low, with smiles that seem Too joyous to be answered with a sigh? The scene is then of prosperous gaiety, Thick-swarming crowds on summer pleasure bent, And equipages formed for luxury; While rosy children, young and innocent, Dance in the onward path, and frolic with content. XLII But when the scattered leaves on those wan boughs Quiver beneath the night wind's rustling breath; When jocund merriment, and whispered vows, And children's shouts, are hushed; and still as Death Lies all in heaven above and earth beneath; When clear and distant shine the steadfast stars O'er lake and river, mountain, brake, and heath,— And smile, unconscious of the woe that mars The beauty of earth's face, deformed by Misery's scars; XLIII What see the old trees then? Gaunt, pallid forms Come, creeping sadly to their hollow hearts, Seeking frail shelter from the winds and storms, In broken rest, disturbed by fitful starts; There, when the chill rain falls, or lightning darts, Or balmy summer nights are stealing on, Houseless they slumber, close to wealthy marts And gilded homes:—there, where the morning sun That tide of wasteful joy and splendour looked upon! XLIV There the man hides, whose “better days” are dropped Round his starvation, like a veil of shame; Who, till the fluttering pulse of life hath stopped, Suffers in silence, and conceals his name:— There the lost victim, on whose tarnished fame A double taint of Death and Sin must rest, Dreams of her village home and Parents' blame, And in her sleep by pain and cold opprest, Draws close her tattered shawl across her shivering breast. XLV Her history is written in her face; The bloom hath left her cheek, but not from age; Youth, without innocence, or love, or grace, Blotted with tears, still lingers on that page! Smooth brow, soft hair, dark eyelash, seem to wage With furrowed lines a contradiction strong; Till the wild witchcraft stories, which engage Our childish thoughts, of magic change and wrong, Seem realised in her—so old, and yet so young! XLVI And many a wretch forlorn, and huddled group Of strangers met in brotherhood of woe, Heads that beneath their burden weakly stoop,— Youth's tangled curls, and Age's locks of snow,— Rest on those wooden pillows, till the glow Of morning o'er the brightening earth shall pass, And these depart, none asking where they go; Lost in the World's confused and gathering mass,— While a new slide fills up Life's magic-lantern glass. XLVII Child of the Islands! in thy royal bowers, Calm thou shalt slumber, set apart from pain; Thy spring-day spent in weaving pendent flowers, Or watching sun-bows glitter through the rain, Spanning with glorious arch the distant plain; Or listening to the wood-bird's merry call; Or gathering sea-shells by the surging main; And, wheresoe'er thy joyous glances fall, The wise shall train thy mind, to glean delight from all. XLVIII But most thou'lt love all young and tender things, And open wide and bright, in pleased surprise, When the soft nestling spreads its half-fledged wings, Thy innocent and wonder-loving eyes, To see him thus attempt the sunny skies! Thou shalt enjoy the kitten's frolic mood, Pursue in vain gay-painted butterflies, Watch the sleek puppy lap its milky food, And fright the clucking hen, with all her restless brood. XLIX Eager thou'lt gaze, where, down the river's tide, The proud swan glides, and guards its lonely nest; Or where the white lambs spot the mountain's side, Where late the lingering sunshine loves to rest; Midst whom, in frock of blue and coloured vest, Lies the young shepherd boy, who little heeds (The livelong day by drowsy dreams opprest) The nibbling, bleating flock that round him feeds, But to his faithful dog leaves all the care it needs. L In time, less simple sights and sounds of Earth Shall yield thy mind a pleasure not less pure: Mighty beginnings—schemes of glorious birth— In which th' Enthusiast deems he may secure, By rapid labour, Fame that shall endure; Complex machines to lessen human toil, Fair artist-dreams, which Beauty's forms allure, New methods planned to till the fertile soil, And marble graven works, which time forbears to spoil. LI For, like the Spring, Man's heart hath buds and leaves, Which, sunned upon, put forth immortal bloom; Gifts, that from Heaven his nascent soul receives, Which, being heavenly, shall survive the tomb. In its blank silence, in its narrow gloom, The clay may rest which wrapped his human birth; But, all unconquered by that bounded doom, The Spirit of his Thought shall walk the earth, In glory and in light, midst life, and joy, and mirth. LII Thou'rt dead, oh, Sculptor—dead! but not the less (Wrapped in pale glory from th' illumined shrine) Thy sweet St. Mary stands in her recess, Worshipped and wept to, as a thing divine: Thou'rt dead, oh, Poet!—dead, oh, brother mine! But not the less the curbèd hearts stoop low Beneath the passion of thy fervent line: And thou art dead, oh, Painter! but not so Thy Inspiration's work, still fresh in living glow. LIII These are the rulers of the earth! to them The better spirits due allegiance own; Vain is the might of rank's proud diadem, The golden sceptre, or the jewelled crown; Beyond the shadow of a mortal frown Lofty they soar! O'er these, pre-eminent, God only, Sovran regnant, looketh down, God! who to their intense perception lent All that is chiefest good and fairest excellent. LIV Wilt thou take measure of such minds as these, Or sound, with plummet-line, the Artist-Heart? Look where he meditates among the trees— His eyelids full of love, his lips apart With restless smiles; while keen his glances dart, Above—around—below—as though to seek Some dear companion, whom, with eager start, He will advance to welcome, and then speak The burning thoughts for which all eloquence is weak. LV How glad he looks! Whom goeth he to meet? Whom? God:—there is no solitude for him. Lies the earth lonely round his wandering feet? The birds are singing in the branches dim, The water ripples to the fountains' brim, The young lambs in the distant meadows bleat; And he himself beguiles fatigue of limb With broken lines, and snatches various sweet, Of ballads old, quaint hymns for Nature's beauty meet! LVI Love is too earthly-sensual for his dream; He looks beyond it, with his spirit-eyes! His passionate gaze is for the sunset-beam, And to that fainting glory, as it dies, Belongs the echo of his swelling sighs. Pale wingèd Thoughts, the children of his Mind, Hover around him as he onward hies; They murmur to him “Hope!” with every wind, Though to their lovely Shapes our grosser sight is blind. LVII But who shall tell, when want and pain have crost The clouded light of some forsaken day, What germs of Beauty have been crushed and lost, What flashing thoughts have gleamed to fade away? Oh! since rare flowers must yet take root in clay, And perish if due culture be denied; Let it be held a Royal boast to say, For lack of aid, no heaven-born genius died; Nor dwindled withering down, in desert-sands of Pride! LVIII The lily-wand is theirs! the Angel-gift! And, if the Earthly one with failing hand Hold the high glory, do Thou gently lift, And give him room in better light to stand. For round Thee, like a garden, lies the land His pilgrim feet must tread through choking dust; And Thou wert born to this world's high command, And he was born to keep a Heavenly Trust; And both account to One, the Merciful and Just. LIX Youth is the spring-time of untarnished life! Spring, the green youth of the unfaded year! We watch their promise, midst the changeful strife Of storms that threaten and of skies that clear, And wait, until the harvest-time appear. Child of the Islands, may those springs which shed Their blossoms round thee, give no cause for fear; And may'st thou gently bend, and meekly tread, Thy garlanded glad path, till summer light be fled! SUMMER. THE ARGUMENT. The Pleasures and Toils of Summer—The Woodlands—Moonlight by Land and Sea—Gipsey Girl in Prison—Thoughts on the Education of the Poor—The Child's Prison at Parkhurst, in the Isle of Wight—The Ignorant the Worst Offenders—Trial of a Felon—Power of Leading the Minds of others a Talent entrusted to us, for which we shall be held accountable—Father Mathew—“The Child of the Islands”—His Guidance and Education a subject of unremitting Care—The Claim of the Poor and Ignorant on his Compassion and Assistance—The Oaks of Windsor—England's Glory—The Ship—Vicissitudes of a Sea-life. I For Summer followeth with its store of joy; That, too, can bring thee only new delight; Its sultry hours can work thee no annoy, Veiled from thy head shall be its glowing might. Sweet fruits shall tempt thy thirsty appetite; Thy languid limbs on cushioned down shall sink; Or rest on fern-grown tufts, by streamlets bright, Where the large-throated deer come down to drink, And cluster gently round the cool refreshing brink. II There, as the flakèd light, with changeful ray (From where the unseen glory hotly glows) Through the green branches maketh pleasant way, And on the turf a chequered radiance throws, Thou'lt lean, and watch those kingly-antlered brows— The lustrous beauty of their glances shy, As following still the pace their leader goes, (Who seems afraid to halt—ashamed to fly,) Rapid, yet stately too, the lovely herd troop by. III This is the time of shadow and of flowers, When roads gleam white for many a winding mile; When gentle breezes fan the lazy hours, And balmy rest o'erpays the time of toil; When purple hues and shifting beams beguile The tedious sameness of the heath-grown moor; When the old grandsire sees with placid smile The sunburnt children frolic round his door, And trellised roses deck the cottage of the poor. IV The time of pleasant evenings! when the moon Riseth companioned by a single star, And rivals e'en the brilliant summer noon In the clear radiance which she pours afar; No stormy winds her hour of peace to mar, Or stir the fleecy clouds which melt away Beneath the wheels of her illumined car; While many a river trembles in her ray, And silver gleam the sands round many an ocean bay! V Oh, then the heart lies hushed, afraid to beat, In the deep absence of all other sound; And home is sought with loth and lingering feet, As though that shining tract of fairy ground, Once left and lost, might never more be found! And happy seems the life that gipsies lead, Who make their rest where mossy banks abound, In nooks where unplucked wild-flowers shed their seed; A canvass-spreading tent the only roof they need! VI Wild Nomades of our civilised calm land! Whose Eastern origin is still betrayed By the swart beauty of the slender hand,— Eyes flashing forth from over-arching shade,— And supple limbs, for active movement made; How oft, beguiled by you, the maiden looks For love her fancy ne'er before pourtrayed, And, slighting village swains and shepherd-crooks, Dreams of proud youths, dark spells, and wondrous magic books! VII Lo! in the confines of a dungeon cell, (Sore weary of its silence and its gloom!) One of this race: who yet deserveth well The close imprisonment which is her doom: Lawless she was, ere infancy's first bloom Left the round outline of her sunny cheek; Vagrant, and prowling Thief;—no chance, no room To bring that wild heart to obedience meek; Therefore th' avenging law its punishment must wreak. VIII She lies, crouched up upon her pallet bed, Her slight limbs starting in unquiet sleep; And oft she turns her feverish, restless head, Moans, frets, and murmurs, or begins to weep: Anon, a calmer hour of slumber deep Sinks on her lids; some happier thought hath come; Some jubilee unknown she thinks to keep, With liberated steps, that wander home Once more with gipsy tribes a gipsy life to roam. IX But no, her pale lips quiver as they moan: What whisper they? A name, and nothing more: But with such passionate tenderness of tone, As shews how much those lips that name adore. She dreams of one who shall her loss deplore With the unbridled anguish of despair! Whose forest-wanderings by her side are o'er, But to whose heart one braid of her black hair Were worth the world's best throne, and all its treasures rare. X The shadow of his eyes is on her soul— His passionate eyes, that held her in such love! Which love she answered, scorning all control Of reasoning thoughts, which tranquil bosoms move. No lengthened courtship it was his to prove, (Gleaning capricious smiles by fits and starts) Nor feared her simple faith lest he should rove: Rapid and subtle as the flame that darts To meet its fellow flame, shot passion through their hearts. XI And though no holy priest that union blessed, By gipsy laws and customs made his bride; The love her looks avowed, in words confessed, She shared his tent, she wandered by his side, His glance her morning star, his will her guide. Animal beauty and intelligence Were her sole gifts,—his heart they satisfied,— Himself could claim no higher, better sense, So loved her with a love, wild, passionate, intense! XII And oft, where flowers lay spangled round about, And to the dying twilight incense shed, They sat to watch heaven's glittering stars come out, Her cheek down-leaning on his cherished head— That head upon her heart's soft pillow laid In fulness of content; and such deep spell Of loving silence, that the word first said With startling sweetness on their senses fell, Like silver coins dropped down a many-fathomed well. XIII Look! her brows darken with a sudden frown— She dreams of Rescue by his angry aid— She dreams he strikes the Law's vile minions down, And bears her swiftly to the wild-wood shade! There, where their bower of bliss at first was made, Safe in his sheltering arms once more she sleeps: Ah, happy dream! She wakes; amazed, afraid, Like a young panther from her couch she leaps, Gazes bewildered round, then madly shrieks and weeps! XIV For, far above her head, the prison-bars Mock her with narrow sections of that sky She knew so wide, and blue, and full of stars, When gazing upward through the branches high Of the free forest! Is she, then, to die? Where is he—where—the strong-armed and the brave, Who in that vision answered her wild cry? Where is he—where—the lover who should save And snatch her from her fate—an ignominious grave? XV Oh, pity her, all sinful though she be, While thus the transient dreams of freedom rise, Contrasted with her waking destiny! Scorn is for devils; soft compassion lies In angel-hearts, and beams from angel-eyes. Pity her! Never more, with wild embrace, Those flexile arms shall clasp him ere she dies; Never the fierce sad beauty of her face Be lit with gentler hope, or love's triumphant grace! XVI Lonely she perishes; like some wild bird That strains its wing against opposing wires; Her heart's tumultuous panting may be heard, While to the thought of rescue she aspires; Then, of its own deep strength, it faints and tires: The frenzy of her mood begins to cease; Her varying pulse with fluttering stroke expires, And the sick weariness that is not peace Creeps slowly through her blood, and promises release. XVII Alas, dark shadows, press not on her so! Stand off, and let her hear the linnet sing! Crumble, ye walls, that sunshine may come through Each crevice of your ruins! Rise, clear spring, Bubbling from hidden fountain-depths, and bring Water, the death-thirst of her pain to slake! Come from the forest, breeze with wandering wing! There, dwelt a heart would perish for her sake,— Oh, save her! No! Death stands prepared his prey to take. XVIII But, because youth and health are very strong, And all her veins were full of freshest life, The deadly struggle must continue long Ere the free heart lie still, that was so rife With passion's mad excess. The gaoler's wife Bends, with revolted pity on her brow, To watch the working of that fearful strife, Till the last quivering spark is out. And now All's dark, all's cold, all's lost, that loved and mourned below. XIX She could not live in prison—could not breathe The dull pollution of its stagnant air,— She, that at dewy morn was wont to wreathe The wild-briar roses, singing, in her hair,— She died, heart-stifled, in that felon-lair! No penitence; no anchor that held fast To soothing meditation and meek prayer, But a wild struggle, even to the last— In death-distorted woe her marble features cast! XX And none lament for her, save only him Who choking back proud thoughts and words irate, With tangled locks, and glances changed and dim, Bows low to one who keeps the prison-gate, Pleading to see her; asking of her fate; Which, when he learns, with fierce and bitter cries (Howling in savage grief for his young mate) He curseth all, and all alike defies;— Despair and fury blent, forth flashing from worn eyes! XXI With vulgar terror struck, they deem him wild— Fit only for the chains which madmen clank. But soon he weepeth, like a little child! And many a day, by many a sunny bank, Or forest-pond, close fringed with rushes dank, He wails, his clenched hands on his eyelids prest; Or by lone hedges, where the grass grows rank, Stretched prone, as travellers deem, in idle rest, Mourns for that murdered girl, the dove of his wild nest. XXII Little recks he, of Law and Law's constraint, Reared in ill-governed sense of Liberty! At times he bows his head, heart-stricken, faint; Anon—in strange delirious agony— He dreams her yet in living jeopardy! His arm is raised,—his panting breast upheaves,— Ah! what avails his youth's wild energy? What strength can lift the withering autumn leaves, Light as they drifting lie on her for whom he grieves! XXIII Her Spring had ripened into Summer fruit; And, if that fruit was poison, whose the blame? Not hers, whose young defying lips are mute— Though hers the agony, though hers the shame— But theirs, the careless crowd, who went and came, And came and went again, and never thought How best such wandering spirits to reclaim; How earnest minds the base have trained and taught, As shaping tools vile forms have into beauty wrought. XXIV The land that lies a blank and barren waste We drain, we till, we sow, with cheerful hope: Plodding and patient, looking yet to taste Reward in harvest, willingly we cope With thorns that stay the plough on plain and slope, And nipping frosts, and summer heats that broil. Till all is done that lies within the scope Of man's invention, to improve that soil, Earnest we yet speed on, unceasing in our toil. XXV But for the soul that lieth unreclaimed, Choked with the growth of rankest weeds and tares, No man puts forth his hand, and none are blamed; Though plenteous harvest might repay his cares, Though he might “welcome angels, unawares.” The earth he delves, and clears from every weed, But leaves the human heart to sinful snares; The earth he sows with costly, precious seed, But lets the human heart lie barren at its need. XXVI Once I beheld (and, to my latest hour, That sight unfaded in my heart I hold) A bright example of the mighty power One human mind, by earnest will controlled, Can wield o'er other minds—the base and bold, Steeped in low vice, and warped in conscious wrong; Or weaker wanderers from the Shepherd's fold, Who, sinning with averted faces, long To turn again to God, with psalm and angel-song. XXVII I saw one man, armed simply with God's Word, Enter the souls of many fellow-men, And pierce them sharply as a two-edged sword, While conscience echoed back his words again; Till, even as showers of fertilising rain Sink through the bosom of the valley clod, So their hearts opened to the wholesome pain, And hundreds knelt upon the flowery sod, One good man's earnest prayer the link 'twixt them and God. XXVIII That amphitheatre of awe-struck heads Is still before me: there the Mother bows, And o'er her slumbering infant meekly sheds Unusual tears. There, knitting his dark brows, The penitent blasphemer utters vows Of holy import. There, the kindly man, Whose one weak vice went near to bid him lose All he most valued when his life began, Abjures the evil course which erst he blindly ran. XXIX There, with pale eyelids heavily weighed down By a new sense of overcoming shame, A youthful Magdalen, whose arm is thrown Round a young sister who deserves no blame; (As though like innocence she now would claim, Absolved by a pure God!) And, near her, sighs The Father who refused to speak her name: Her penitence is written in her eyes— Will he not, too, forgive, and bless her, ere she rise? XXX Renounce her not, grieved Father! Heaven shall make Room for her entrance with the undefiled. Upbraid her not, sad Mother! for the sake Of days when she was yet thy spotless child. Be gentle with her, oh, thou sister mild! And thou, good brother! though by shame opprest; For many a day, amid temptations wild, Madly indulged, and sinfully carest, She yearned to weep and die upon thy honest breast. XXXI Lost Innocence!—that sunrise of clear youth, Whose lovely light no morning can restore; When, robed in radiance of unsullied truth, Her soul no garment of concealment wore, But roamed its paradise of fancies o'er In perfect purity of thought—is past! But He who bid the guilty “sin no more” A gleam of mercy round her feet shall cast, And guide the pilgrim back to heaven's “strait Gate” at last. XXXII By that poor lost one, kneel a happier group, Children of sinners, christened free from sin; Smiling, their curled and shining heads they stoop, Awed, but yet fearless; confident to win Blessings of God; while early they begin (The Samuels of the Temple) thus to wait His audible voice, whose Presence they are in, And formally, from this auspicious date, Themselves, and their young lives, to Him to dedicate. XXXIII While, mingling with those glad and careless brows, And ruddy cheeks, embrowned with honest toil; Kneels the pale artisan (who only knows Of Luxury—how best its glittering spoil, Midst whirring wheels, and dust, and heat, and oil, For richer men's enjoyment to prepare); And ill-fed labourers of a fertile soil, Whose drunkenness was Lethe to their care,— All met, for one good hope, one blessing, and one prayer! XXXIV I will not cavil with the man who sneers At priestly labours, as the work of hell; I will not pause to contradict strange fears Of where the influence ends, begun so well; One only thought remained with me to dwell, For ever with remembrance of that scene, When I beheld hearts beat and bosoms swell, And that melodious voice and eye serene Govern the kneeling crowd, as he their God had been. XXXV I thought, in my own secret soul, if thus, (By the strong sympathy that knits mankind) A power untried exists in each of us, By which a fellow-creature's wavering mind To good or evil deeds may be inclined; Shall not an awful questioning be made, (And we, perchance, no fitting answer find!) “Whom hast Thou sought to rescue, or persuade? Whom roused from sinful sloth? whom comforted, afraid?” XXXVI For whom employed,—e'en from thy useless birth,— The buried Talent at thy Lord's command? Unprofitable servant of the earth! Though here men fawned on thee, and licked thy hand For golden wealth, and power, and tracts of land; When the Eternal Balance justly weighs, Above thee, in the ranks of heaven, shall stand, Some wretch obscure, who through unnoticed days, Taught a poor village school to sing their Maker's praise. XXXVII A mournful memory in my bosom stirs! A recollection of the lovely isle Where, in the purple shadow of thy firs Parkhurst! and gloomy in the summer smile, Stands the Child's Prison: (since we must defile So blest a refuge, with so curst a name) The home of those whose former home was vile; Who, dogged, sullen, scoffing, hither came, Tender in growth and years, but long confirmed in shame. XXXVIII Alas! what inmates may inhabit there? Those to whose infant days a parent's roof, In lieu of a protection, was a snare; Those from whose minds instruction held aloof, No hope, no effort made in their behoof; Whose lips familiar were with blasphemy, And words obscene that mocked at all reproof, But never uttered prayer to the Most High, Or learned one gentle hymn, His name to glorify. XXXIX Th' Untaught, Uncared-for, 'neath whose stolid look The Scriptures might have lain, a block of wood, Hewn to the shape and semblance of a book, For any thing they knew in it of good, Or any text they heard or understood. These are your Prisoned Children! Germs of Men, Vicious, and false, and violent of mood, Such as strange carelessness first rears, and then Would crush the sting out by a death of pain! XL But skilful hands have drawn the arrow's barb From the unfestered wound which Time shall heal! And though 'tis mournful, in their prison garb, To see them trooping to their silent meal; And though, among them, many brows reveal Sorrow too bitter for such childish hearts; Yet the most pitiful (if just) must feel (E'en while the tear of forced compassion starts) That blessed is the hope their suffering imparts! XLI The Saved are there, who would have been the Lost; The Checked in crime, who might have been the Doomed; The wildbriar buds, whose tangled path was crost By nightshade poison trailing where they bloomed! The Wrecked, round whom the threatening surges boomed, Borne in this Life-boat far from peril's stress; The Sheltered, o'er whose heads the thunder loomed; Convicts (convicted of much helplessness;) Exiles, whom Mercy guides through guilt's dark wilderness. XLII I saw One sitting in that Island Prison Whose day in solitude was going down, E'en as in solitude its light had risen! His little savage sullen face, bent down, From all kind words, with an averted frown— A world of dumb defiance in his scowl! Or, looking up, with gaze that seemed to own, “I scorn the smiting of your forced control; My body scourge or slay, you shall not bend my soul!” XLIII But one was weeping—weeping bitter tears! Of softer mould his erring heart was made; And, when the sound of coming steps he hears Advancing to his lone cell's cheerless shade, He turns, half welcoming and half afraid, Trustful of pity, willing to be saved; Stepping half way to meet the proffered aid; Thankful for blessings kind and counsel grave; Strange to this new sad life, but patient, calm, and brave. XLIV Brave! for what courage must it not require In a child's heart, to bear those dreadful hours? Think how we find the weary spirit tire, How the soul sinks with faint and flagging powers, Pent in, in these indulgent lives of ours, By one monotonous day of winter's rain! Woe for the prisoned boy, who sadly cowers, In his blank cell, for days of dreary pain, Pining for human looks and human tones in vain. XLV Nor let it be forgot, for these young spirits, (Although by gross and vulgar sin defiled,) How differently judged were their demerits, Were each a noble's or a gentle's child. Are there no sons at college, “sadly wild?” No children, wayward, difficult to rear? Are they cast off by Love? No, gleaming mild Through the salt drops of many a bitter tear, The rainbow of your hope shines out of all your fear! XLVI For they are young, you say; and this green stem With shoots of good shall soon be grafted in: Meanwhile, how much is frolic, done by them, Which, in the poor, is punishable sin? Nor mark I this, a useless sigh to win, (They lose their ground, who falsely, lightly chide,) But to note down how much your faith you pin Upon the worth of that, to them supplied— Revealed Religion's light, and Education's guide. XLVII Yea, for yourselves and sons, ye trusted it, And knew no reed it was you leaned upon; Therefore, whoso denies that benefit To meaner men in ignorance chained down, From each this true reproach hath justly won:— “Oh, selfish heart! that owned the healing sure, Yet would not help to save my erring son!” They cry to you, “Prevent!”—You cannot cure, The ills that, once incurred, these little ones endure! XLVIII The criminal is in the felon's dock: Fearful and stupified behold him stand! While to his trial cold spectators flock, And lawyers grave, and judges of the land. At first he grasps the rail with nervous hand, Hearing the case which learnedly they state, With what attention ignorance can command: Then, weary of such arguing of his fate, Torpid and dull he sinks, throughout the long debate. XLIX Vapid, incomprehensible to him The skilful pleader's cross-examining wit; His sullen ear receives, confused and dim, The shouts of laughter at some brilliant hit, When a shrewd witness leaves the Biter bit. He shrinks not while the facts that must prevail Against his life, unconscious friends admit; Though Death is trembling in the adverse scale, He recks no more than if he heard the autumn gale. L Oh, Eloquence, a moving thing art thou! Tradition tells us many a mournful story Of scaffold-sentenced men, with noble brow, Condemned to die in youth, or weak and hoary, Whose words survived in long-remembered glory! But eloquence of words the power hath not (Nor even their fate, who perished gaunt and gory) To move my spirit like his abject lot, Who stands there, like a dog, new-sentenced to be shot! LI Look, now! Attention wakes, with sudden start, The brutish mind which late so dull hath been! Quick grows the heavy beating at his heart! The solemn pause which rests the busy scene, He knows, though ignorant, what that must mean— The Verdict! With the Jury rests his chance! And his lack-lustre eye grows strangely keen, Watching with wistful, pleading, dreadful glance, Their consultation cease, their foreman slow advance. LII His home, his hopes, his life, are in that word! His ties! (for think ye not that he hath ties?) Alas! Affection makes its pleading heard Long after better sense of duty dies, Midst all that Vice can do to brutalise. Hark to the verdict—“Guilty!”—All are foes! Oh, what a sight for good, compassionate eyes, That haggard man; as, stupified with woes, Forth from the felon's dock, a wretch condemned he goes! LIII A wretch condemned, but not at heart subdued. Rebellious, reckless, are the thoughts which come Intruding on his sentenced solitude:— Savage defiance! gnawing thoughts of home! Plots to escape even now his threatened doom! Sense of desertion, persecution!—all Choke up the fount of grief, and bid the foam Stand on his gnashing lips when tears should fall, And mock the exhorting tones which for repentance call! LIV For if one half the pity and the pains, The charity, and visiting, and talk, Had been bestowed upon that wretch in chains, While he had yet a better path to walk, Life's flower might still have bloomed upon its stalk! He might not now stand there, condemned for crime, (Helpless the horror of his fate to balk!) Nor heard the sullen bell, with funeral chime, Summon him harshly forth, to die before his time! LV Child of the Islands! thou, whose cradle-bed Was hallowed still with night and morning prayer! Thou, whose first thoughts were reverently led To heaven, and taught betimes to anchor there! Thou, who wert reared with fond peculiar care, In happiest leisure, and in holiest light! Wilt Thou not feed the lamp whose lustre rare Can break the darkness of this fearful night, Midst dim bewild'ring paths to guide faint steps aright? LVI Wilt thou not help to educate the poor? They will learn something, whether taught or no; The Mind's low dwelling hath an open door, Whence, wandering still uneasy, to and fro, It gathers that it should, or should not, know. Oh, train the fluttering of that restless wing! Guide the intelligence that worketh woe! So shall the Summer answer to the Spring, And a well-guided youth an age of duty bring. LVII Thus,—freed from the oppressive pang which chokes A young warm heart that pities men in vain,— Thou'lt roam beneath thy Windsor's spreading oaks, And see Life's course before thee, clear and plain, And how to spare, and how to conquer, pain: Or, greeting fair Etona's merry groups, Thou'lt think, not only for this noble train, The dovelike wing of Science brooding stoops, But shadows many a head that else obscurely droops! LVIII Glad shalt thou roam beneath those oaks, fair Boy! While round thy conscious feet the earth's cold dust Reflects a sunshine from the Poor Man's joy! There dream of England's Glory: nor distrust Thy cheering hopes, for men who seek to thrust Cold counsel on thy young, inspired heart; Pleading that, though 'tis politic and just To fill each studded port and loaded mart, Utopian are the schemes free knowledge to impart! LIX Yet shalt thou dream of England's commerce, too; And the tall spreading trees,—which, branching round, Thy footsteps to their covert coolness woo,— Cast visionary shadows on the ground Of floating ships for distant stations bound. Unheard shall be the wild-bird's song! Instead, Hoarsely the roar of fancied waves shall sound; And o'er the shining sands thy soul shall tread, With Albion's snowy cliffs high beetling o'er thy head! LX Or Thought, in her strange chaos, shall display That proudest sight reserved for English eyes— The building ship—which soon shall cleave its way Through the blue waters, 'neath the open skies. The stately oak is felled, and low it lies, Denuded of its lovely branches—bare Of e'en the bark that wrapped its giant size Roughly defying all the storms of air, One fragment of its gnarled and knotted strength to tear. LXI Out of its swelling girth are aptly hewn The timbers fitted for the massive frame; By perfect rule and measurement foreshewn, Plank after plank, each answering to the same, The work goes on—a thing without a name— Huge as a house, and heavy as a rock, Enough the boldest looker-on to tame, Standing up-gazing at that monstrous block, Whose grand proportions seem his narrow sense to mock. LXII And ceaseless, hammering, shouting, pigmy forms Work, crawl, and clatter on her bulging sides: Are those the beings, who, in Heaven's wild storms, Shall move that mass against opposing tides? One, tread her decks, with proud impetuous strides? Others, through yawning port-holes point the gun,— Scattering the foe her glorious strength derides, And shouting “Victory” for a sea-fight won? Oh, magic rule of Mind, by which such works are done! LXIII But, first, the Launch must send our ship afloat: Assembled thousands wait the glorious sight: Gay-coloured streamers deck each tiny boat, And glistening oars reflect a restless light: Till some fair form, with smiles and blushes bright, And active hand (though delicate it seem) Advances to perform the “Christening Rite;” The fragile crystal breaks, with shivering gleam, And the grand mass comes forth, swift gliding, like a dream. LXIV Now give her Masts and Sails!—those spreading wings Whose power shall save from many a dangerous coast! Her Ropes, with all their bolts, and blocks, and rings; Her glorious Flag, no foe shall dare to brave Who sees it come careering o'er the wave! Give her, the Hearts of Oak, who, marshalled all, Within her creaking ribs when tempests rave And the fierce billows beat that echoing wall, Fearless and calm obey the Boatswain's mustering call. LXV Give her, those giant Anchors, whose deep plunge Into the startled bosom of the Sea, Shall give the eager sailor leave to lounge In port awhile, with reckless liberty. (Soon shall his changeful heart impatiently, For their unmooring and upheaving long; For “Sailing-orders” which shall set him free; While his old messmates, linked in brawny throng, Coil up the Cable's length—huge, intricate, and strong!) LXVI Give her, her Captain! who, from that day forth, With her loved beauty all his speech shall fill; And all her wanderings, East, West, South, and North, Narrate,—with various chance of good and ill,— As though she lived, and acted of free will. Yet, let no lip with mocking smile be curled;— These are the souls, that man with dauntless skill, Our Wooden Walls; whose Meteor-flag, unfurled, Bids England “hold her own” against th' united world! LXVII Dear Island-Home!—and is the boast so strange Which bids thee claim the Empire of the Sea? O'er the blue waters as we fearless range, Seem not the waves familiar friends to be? We knew them in the Country of the Free! And now they follow us with playful race, Back rolling to that land of liberty, And dashing round her rocks with rough embrace, Like an old shaggy dog that licks its Master's face. LXVIII Yea, and a Watch-dog too, if there be need! A low determined growl, when danger lowers, Shall, from the gloomy port-holes, grimly speed, To rouse our Heroes, and our armèd Powers. Let the land-circled nations keep their towers, Their well-scanned passports, and their guards secure,— We'll trust this floating, changeful wall of ours, And, long as ocean-waves and rocks endure, So long, dear Island-Home, we'll hold thy freedom sure! LXIX Back to our ship! She breasts the surging tide; The fair breeze freshens in the flowing sheet! With deafening cheers the landsmen see her glide, And hearts, that watch her progress, wildly beat. Oh! where and when shall all the many meet, Who part to-day? That secret none may sound! But slowly falls the tread of homeward feet; And, in the evening, with a sigh goes round, That brief, but thrilling toast, “Health to the Outward-Bound!” LXX Health to the Outward-Bound! How many go Whose homeward voyage never shall be made! Who but that drear Sea-Burial shall know, Which bids the corse the shifting flood invade! No grave—no stone beneath the cypress-shade, Where mourning friends may gather round and weep, Whose distant wretchedness is yet delayed: Orphans at home a jubilee may keep, While Messmates' hands commit a Father to the deep! LXXI Some, whom the cry of “Fire!” doth overtake On the wide desert of the lonely seas, Their vague escape in open boats shall make; To suffer quenchless thirst, and parched disease, And hunger-pangs the death-lot shall appease. Some, crashing wrecked in one stupendous shock, Endure more helpless rapid fate than these, And vainly clinging to the foam-washed block, Die, drifted like weak weeds from off the slippery rock. LXXII Some, scarcely parted twice a cable's length From those who on the firm earth safely stand, Shall madly watch the strained united strength And cheers and wavings of the gallant band, Who launch their life-boat with determined hand. Ah! none shall live, that zealous aid to thank; The wild surge whirls the life-boat back to land,— The hazy distance suddenly grows blank,— In that last labouring plunge the fated vessel sank! LXXIII And some shall plough their homeward track in vain, Dying, it may be, within sight of shore: While others, (dreariest horror of the main!) Are vaguely “lost” and never heard of more. Ah, me! how many now such fate deplore, As his for whom Grief's wild and piercing cry Followed, e'er yet lamenting tears were o'er, Shed for his brother; doomed, like him, to die In youth,—but not like him without one kinsman nigh! LXXIV Peace to thy woeful heart, thou grey-haired sire;— Each, had he lived, his duty would have done: Towards gallant deeds unwearied to aspire, Was thine own heritage to either son. Yet thou hast wept,—like him whose race is run,— Who rose a happy Father when the day Through morning clouds, with misty radiance shone; But when at eve his ship got under way, Left his unburied son in wild Algoa Bay! LXXV His generous son, who risked his own young life Hoping another from that doom to save; And battled nobly with the water's strife, E'er the green billows were his floating grave. Nor died alone, beneath the whelming wave; Others,—less known perhaps,—not cherished less By those who for their presence vainly crave,— Sank struggling down in utter weariness, Lost in that wild dark night of terrible distress. LXXVI Oh, hearts have perished, neither faint nor few, Whose names have left no echo save at home; With many a gallant ship, whose fearless crew Set sail with cheerful hope their course to roam! Buried 'neath many a fathom's shifting foam,— By the rude rocks of many a distant shore,— Their visionary smiles at midnight come To those whose waking eyes their loss deplore,— Dreaming of their return, who shall return no more! LXXVII Child of the Islands! some such saddening tales, Thou, in thine infancy, perchance shalt hear; Linked with the names a Nation still bewails, And warrior-deeds to England's glory dear. Ah! let them not fall lightly on thine ear! Though Death calmed down that anguish, long ago, The record is not ended; year by year Recurring instances of loss and woe Shall bid thee, for like grief, a like compassion show! LXXVIII Neglect not, Thou, the sons of men who bled To do good service in the former time; Slight not some veteran father of the Dead, Whose noble boys have perished in their prime. Accept not selfishly, the love sublime And loyalty which in such souls hath burned. What though it be thy right; the lack, a crime? Yet should no honest heart by thine be spurned— True service paid with smiles, and thanks, is cheaply earned. LXXIX Keep Thou the reverence of a youthful heart To Age and Merit in thy native land; Nor deem Condition sets thee far apart: Above, but not Aloof, a Prince should stand: Still near enough, to stretch the friendly hand To those whose names had never reached the throne, But for great deeds, performed in small command: Since thus the gallant wearers first were known, Hallow those names; although not Royal like thine own. LXXX And let thy Smile be like the Summer Sun, Whose radiance is not kept for garden-flowers, But sends its genial beams to rest upon The meanest blushing bud in way-side bowers. Earth's Principalities, and Thrones, and Powers, If Heaven's true Delegates on Earth they be, Should copy Heaven; which giveth fertile Showers, The Dew, the Warmth, the Balm, the Breezes free, Not to one Class alone,—but all Humanity! END OF SUMMER. AUTUMN. THE ARGUMENT. The Beauty of Autumn—The Moorlands of Scotland—The Heather Brae—A Sabbath Morning on the Hills—Church Discord—The “Free” Church—Saints on Earth and Saints in Heaven—An English Harvest—The Reaper's Child—Harvest-Home—Plenty and Privation—Verdict of the Jury: “Starved to Death”—The Curse set on those who Pervert the Judgment of the Poor—The Demagogue—The Patriot—The Necessity and Duty of Exertion in the Common Cause—What Can I Do?—The Individual Value of each Man's Help—The Weak and Strong alike bound to Labour—Neutrality a species of Oppression—Every Man has a Life-Task allotted to him. I Brown Autumn cometh, with her liberal hand Binding the Harvest in a thousand sheaves: A yellow glory brightens o'er the land, Shines on thatched corners and low cottage-eaves, And gilds with cheerful light the fading leaves: Beautiful even here, on hill and dale; More lovely yet where Scotland's soil receives The varied rays her wooded mountains hail, With hues to which our faint and soberer tints are pale. II For there the Scarlet Rowan seems to mock The red sea coral—berries, leaves, and all; Light swinging from the moist green shining rock Which beds the foaming torrent's turbid fall; And there the purple cedar, grandly tall, Lifts its crowned head and sun-illumined stem; And larch (soft drooping like a maiden's pall) Bends o'er the lake, that seems a sapphire gem Dropt from the hoary hill's gigantic diadem. III And far and wide the glorious heather blooms, Its regal mantle o'er the mountains spread; Wooing the bee with honey-sweet perfumes, By many a viewless wild flower richly shed; Up-springing 'neath the glad exulting tread Of eager climbers, light of heart and limb; Or yielding, soft, a fresh elastic bed, When evening shadows gather, faint and dim, And sun-forsaken crags grow old, and gaunt, and grim. IV Oh, Land! first seen when Life lay all unknown, Like an unvisited country o'er the wave, Which now my travelled heart looks back upon, Marking each sunny path, each gloomy cave, With here a memory, and there a grave:— Land of romance and beauty; noble land Of Bruce and Wallace; land where, vainly brave, Ill-fated Stuart made his final stand, Ere yet the shivered sword fell hopeless from his hand— V I love you! I remember you! though years Have fleeted o'er the hills my spirit knew, Whose wild uncultured heights the plough forbears, Whose broomy hollows glisten in the dew. Still shines the calm light with as rich a hue Along the wooded valleys stretched below? Still gleams my lone lake's unforgotten blue? Oh, land! although unseen, how well I know The glory of your face in this autumnal glow! VI I know your deep glens, where the eagles cry; I know the freshness of your mountain breeze, Your brooklets, gurgling downward ceaselessly, The singing of your birds among the trees, Mingling confused a thousand melodies! I know the lone rest of your birchen bowers, Where the soft murmur of the working bees Goes droning past, with scent of heather flowers, And lulls the heart to dream even in its waking hours. VII I know the grey stones in the rocky glen, Where the wild red-deer gather, one by one, And listen, startled, to the tread of men Which the betraying breeze hath backward blown! So,—with such dark majestic eyes, where shone Less terror than amazement,—nobly came Peruvia's Incas, when, through lands unknown, The cruel conqueror with the blood-stained name Swept, with pursuing sword and desolating flame! VIII So taken, so pursued, so tracked to death, The wild free monarch of the hills shall be, By cunning men, who creep, with stifled breath, O'er crag and heather-tuft, on bended knee, Down-crouching with most thievish treachery; Climbing again, with limbs o'erspent and tired, Watching for that their failing eyes scarce see,— The moment, long delayed and long desired, When the quick rifle-shot in triumph shall be fired. IX Look! look!—what portent riseth on the sky? The glory of his great betraying horns; Wide-spreading, many-branched, and nobly-high, (Such spoil the chieftain's hall with pride adorns.) Oh, Forest-King! the fair succeeding morns That brighten o'er those hills, shall miss your crest From their sun-lighted peaks! He's hit,—but scorn To die without a struggle: sore distrest, He flies, while daylight fades, receding in the West. X Ben-Doran glows like iron in the forge, Then to cold purple turns,—then gloomy grey; And down the ravine-pass and mountain-gorge Scarce glimmers now the faintest light of day. The moonbeams on the trembling waters play, (Though still the sky is flecked with bars of gold;) And there the noble creature stands, at bay; His strained limbs shivering with a sense of cold, While weakness films the eye that shone so wildly bold. XI His fair majestic head bows low at length; And, leaping at his torn and bleeding side, The fierce dogs pin him down with grappling strength; While eager men come on with rapid stride, And cheer, exulting in his baffled pride. Now, from its sheath drawn forth, the gleaming knife Stabs his broad throat: the gaping wound yawns wide: One gurgling groan, the last deep sigh of life, Wells with his gushing blood,—and closed is all the strife! XII 'Tis done! The hunted, animal Despair, That hoped and feared no future state, is past: O'er the stiff nostril blows the evening air; O'er the glazed eye real darkness gathers fast; Into a car the heavy corse is cast; And homeward the belated hunter hies, Eager to boast of his success at last, And shew the beauty of his antlered prize, To Her he loves the best,—the maid with gentle eyes! XIII And she, whose tender heart would beat and shrink At the loud yelping of a punished hound, With rosy lips and playful smile shall drink The Highland health to him, that circles round. And where the creature lies, with crimson wound, And cold, stark limbs, and purple eyes half-closed, There shall her gentle feet at morn be found! Of such strange mixtures is the heart composed, So natural-soft,—so hard, by cunning Custom glozed. XIV But, lo! the Sabbath rises o'er those hills! And gathering fast from many a distant home, By wild romantic paths, and shallow rills, The Highland groups to distant worship come. Lightly their footsteps climb, inured to roam Miles through the trackless heather day by day: Lasses, with feet as white as driven foam, And lads, whose various tartans, brightly gay, With shifting colour deck the winding mountain way. XV And some, with folded hands and looks demure, Are nathless stealing lingering looks behind, Their young hearts not less reverently pure Because they hope to welcome accents kind, And, in that Sabbath crowd, the Loved to find; And children, glancing with their innocent eyes, At every flower that quivers in the wind; And grey-haired shepherds, calm, and old, and wise, With peasant-wisdom,—drawn from gazing on the skies. XVI And Auld-Wives, who with Sabbath care have donned Their snowy mutches, clean, and fresh, and white; And pious eyes that well The Book have conned; And snooded heads, bound round with ribands bright; And last,—an old man's grandchild, treading light By his blind footsteps; or a Mother mild, Whose shadowy lashes veil her downcast sight, Bearing along her lately christened child:— And still by friendly talk their journey is beguiled. XVII Oh, Scotland, Scotland!—in these later days, How hath thy decent worship been disgraced! Where, on your Sabbath hills, for prayer and praise, Solemn the feet of reverend elders paced, With what wild brawling, with what ruffian haste, Gathering to brandish Discord's fatal torch, Have men your sacred altar-grounds defaced; Mocking with howling fury, at the porch, The ever-listening God, in his own holy Church! XVIII The Taught would choose their Teacher: be it so! Doubtless his lessons they will humbly learn, Bowing the meek heart reverently low, Who first claim right to choose him or to spurn; Drop sentences of suffrage in the urn; And ballot for that Minister of God, Whose sacred mission is to bid them turn Obedient eyes toward the chastening rod, And walk the narrow path by humbler Christians trod! XIX Choose,—since your forms permit that choice to be,— But choose in brotherhood, and pious love; Assist at that selection solemnly, As at a sacrifice to One above. What! fear ye Rome's high altars? Shall they prove The error and the stumbling-block alone? Their crucifixes, meant your hearts to move,— Their pictured saints—their images of stone— Their Virgins garlanded—their Jesu on his Throne? XX Yea! rather fear “the image of a Voice,” Set up to be an idol and a snare: Fear the impression of your prideful choice, The human heart-beat mingling with the prayer; The heavy sigh that comes all unaware; The sense of weeping, strugglingly represt; The yearning adoration and despair, With which unworthiness is then confest; Mortal disturbance sent to break Religion's rest! XXI Fear the excitement—fear the human power Of eloquent words, which 'twixt you and the skies, Stand like a fretted screen; and, for that hour, Confuse and mar the tranquil light that lies Beyond, unbroken! Fear the glow that dies With the occasion: darkest dangers yawn 'Neath the foundation where your hope would rise: For true light fadeth not, nor is withdrawn, The Lamb's calm City wrapt in one Eternal Dawn! XXII Children, who playing in their ignorant mirth, Behold the sunbeam's warm reflected ray, Reaching to grasp it, touch the blank cold earth, Their eyes averted from the Source of Day, Not knowing where the Actual Glory lay. Fear ye to snatch at glittering beams, and lose The light that should have cheered your mortal way: Tremble, responsible yet weak, to choose; “Ye know not what ye ask,”—nor what ye should refuse! XXIII Say, was it word of power, or fluent speech, Which marked those simple men of Galilee, For Christ's disciples? was it theirs to preach With winning grace, and artful subtilty, The Saviour's message,—“Die to live with me?” Bethsaida's fisherman, who bare the spite Of heathen rage at Patras,—or those three Who saw Him glorified on Tabor's height, And bathed in bloody sweat on dark Gethsemane's night? XXIV The homeliest voice that weakly leads the van Of many prayers, shall sound as sweet among The angel host,—as his, the eloquent man, Who with miraculous sweet, and fervent tongue, Charms with a spell the mute, applauding throng; No better, (as respects his human gift) Than many a Heathen Poet, whose great song, Age after age continues yet to lift, As down the Stream of Time melodious treasures drift. XXV Brothers, why make ye War? and in His Name, Whose message to the earth was Peace and Love; What time the awful voice to Shepherds came, And the clear Herald-Star shone out above? When shall the meaning of that message move Our bitter hearts? When shall we cease to come The patience of a gentle God to prove; Cainlike in temper,—though no life we doom,— Our prayer a curse, although our altar be no tomb? XXVI When that indulgence which the Perfect grants, By the Imperfect also shall be granted; When narrow light that falls in crooked slants, Shines broad and bright where'er its glow is wanted; When cherished errors humbly are recanted; When there are none who set themselves apart, To watch how Prayers are prayed, and sweet hymns chanted; With eyes severe, and criticising heart,— As though some Player flawed the acting of his part. XXVII From Saints on Earth,—defend us, Saints in Heaven! By their un-likeness to the thing they ape; Their cheerlessness, where God such joy hath given, (Covering this fair world with a veil of crape) Their lack of kindliness in any shape; Their fierce, false judgments of another's sin; And by the narrowness of mind they drape With full-blown fantasies, and boasts to win A better path to Heaven, than others wander in! XXVIII And ye, calm Angels in that blissful world, From whence (close knit in brotherhood of strife) The strong rebellious spirits, downward hurled, Came to this Earth, with love and beauty rife, And poisoned all the fountain-wells of life; Spread the soft shelter of your peaceful wings, When hard looks stab us like a two-edged knife, And hearts that yearned for Pity's healing springs, Are mocked, in dying thirst, by gall which Malice brings. XXIX From the cold glare of their self-righteous eyes,— From scornful lips, brimful of bitter words,— From the curled smile that triumphs and defies,— From arguments that sound like clashing swords,— Save us, ye dwellers among music-chords! Whose unseen presence doubtless lingers nigh, Although no more our blinded sense affords Your radiant image to the craving eye, Nor sees your herald-wings, swift-spreading, cleave the sky! XXX No more to Ishmael's thirst, or Hagar's prayer, The suffering or the longing heart on Earth; No more to soothe funereal despair; No more to fill the cruise in bitter dearth, Or turn the widow's wailing into mirth; Shall they return who watched in holy pain The Human Death, that closed the Heavenly Birth! Rebellious earth, twice sanctified in vain, Lonely from those pure steps must evermore remain. XXXI But deep in each man's heart, some angel dwells,— Mournfully, as in a sepulchral tomb; Set o'er our nature like calm sentinels, Denying passage to bad thoughts that come Tempting us weakly to our final doom, Patient they watch, whatever may betide; Shedding pure rays of glory through the gloom, And bowing meek wings over human pride,— As once in the lone grave of Him, the Crucified! XXXII Angels of Grief,—who, when our weak eyes tire Of shedding tears, their sad sweet lessons teach; Angels of Hope,—who lift with strong desire Our mortal thoughts beyond a mortal reach; Angels of Mercy,—who to gentle speech, And meek, forgiving words, the heart incline, Weaving a link of brotherhood for each; Angels of Glory,—whose white vestments shine Around the good man's couch, in dying life's decline. XXXIII Need of such heavenly counterpoise have we To bear us up, when we would grovel down; To keep our clogged and tarnished natures free From the world-rust that round our hearts hath grown Like mouldering moss upon a sculptured stone; To soften down the cruelty and sin Of crabbèd Selfishness, that stands alone, With greedy eyes that watch what they may win, The whole wide world a field to gather harvest in! XXXIV To gather Harvest! In this Autumn prime, Earth's literal harvest cumbers the glad land! This is the sultry moment—the dry time, When the ripe golden ears, that shining stand, Fall, rustling, to the Reaper's nimble hand: When, from those plains the bright sheaves lie among, (Whose fertile view the sloping hills command,) Float cheerful sounds of laughter and of song, And merry-making jests from many a rural throng. XXXV Sweet is the prospect which that distance yields! Here, honest toil;—while there a sunburnt child Sleeps by the hedge-row that divides the fields, Or where the sheltering corn is stacked and piled; And as the groups have one by one defiled, (Leaving unwatched the little sleeper's place,) You guess the Mother, by the way she smiled; The holy Love that lit her peasant-face, The lingering glance, replete with Feeling's matchless grace. XXXVI He lieth safe until her task be done— Lulled, basking, into slumber sound and deep; That Universal Cherisher, the Sun, With kindly glow o'erlooks his harmless sleep, And the rough dog close neighbourhood shall keep, (Friend of the noble and the lowly born) Till careful shepherds fold the wandering sheep, And wearied reapers leave the unfinished corn— Resting through dewy night, to recommence at morn. XXXVII Oh, picture of Abundance and of Joy! Oh, golden Treasure given by God to Man! Why com'st thou shaded by a base alloy? What root of evil poisons Nature's plan? Why should the strain not end as it began, With notes that echo music as they come? What mournful silence—what mysterious ban— Hushes the tones of those who onward roam, With choral gladness singing,—“happy Harvest-Home?” XXXVIII What altered cadence lingers in the Vale, Whose mass of full-eared sheaves the reapers bind? A sound more sad than Autumn-moaning gale, More dreary than the later whistling wind That ushers Winter, bitter and unkind. Again!—it soundeth like a human sigh! A horrid fear grows present to my mind: Here, where the grain is reaped that stood so high, A Man hath lain him down: to slumber?—no,—to die! XXXIX Past the Park gate,—along the market-road,— And where green water-meadows freshly shine, By many a Squire and Peer's unseen abode,— And where the village Alehouse swings its sign, Betokening rest, and food, and strengthening wine,— By the rich dairy, where, at even-tide, Glad Maidens, singing, milk the lowing kine,— Under blank shadowing garden-walls, that hide The espaliered fruit well trained upon their sunnier side,— XL Jaded and foot-sore, he hath struggled on, Retracing with sunk heart his morning track; In vain to him the Harvest and the Sun; Doomed, in the midst of plenteousness, to lack, And die unfed, beneath the loaded stack, He hath been wandering miles to seek Relief; (Disabled servant—Labour's broken hack!) And he returns—refused! His Hour is brief; But there are those at home for whom he groans with grief. XLI My pulse beats faster with the coming fear! I cannot lift his dull expiring weight: What if the fainting wretch should perish here? Here,—sinking down beside the rich man's gate,— On the cropped harvest;—miserable fate! He tells me something—what, I cannot learn: Feeble—confused—the words he fain would state: But accents of complaint I can discern, And mention of his wife and little ones in turn! XLII He's dead! In that last sigh his weak heart burst! An end hath now been put to many woes: The storm-beat mariner hath reached the worst,— His “harbour and his ultimate repose.” He to a world of better justice goes, We to the Inquest-Room, to hear, in vain, Description of the strong convulsive throes, The mighty labour, and the petty gain, By which a struggling life gets quit at last of pain. XLIII To hear, and to forget, the oft-told story, Of what forsaken Want in silence bears: So tarnishing commercial England's glory! To hear rich men deny that poor men's cares Should be accounted business of theirs; To hear pale neighbours (one degree less poor Than him who perished) prove, all unawares, The generous opening of their lowly door, The self-denying hearts that shared the scanty store. XLIV To hear, and acquiesce in, shallow words, Which make it seem the sickly labourer's fault, That he hath no accumulated hoards Of untouched wages; wine, and corn, and malt; To use when eyesight fails, or limbs grow halt; To hear his character at random slurred,— “An idle fellow, sir, not worth his salt;” And every one receive a bitter word For whom his clay-cold heart with living love was stirred: XLV His Wife, a shrew and slattern, knowing not (What all her betters understand so well) How to bring comfort to a poor man's lot, How to keep house,—and how to buy and sell; His Daughter, a degraded minx, who fell At sixteen years,—and bore a child of shame, Permitted with th' immoral set to dwell! His eldest Son, an idiot boy, and lame,— In short, the man was starved—but no one was to blame. XLVI No one:—Oh! “Merry England,” hearest thou? Houseless and hungry died he on thy breast! No one: Oh! “Fertile England,” did thy plough— Furrow no fields; or was their growth represt By famine-blights that swept from east to west? No one:—“Religious England,” preach the word In thy thronged temples on the Day of Rest, And bid the war of Faith and Works accord:— “Who giveth to the Poor, he lendeth to the Lord!” XLVII Trust me, that not a soul whose idle hand Stinted to spare, and so declined to save; Not one of all who call it “Native Land,” Which to their dead and starved compatriot gave A humble cradle,—and a lowlier grave,— Stands blameless of this death before the face Of judging Heaven! The gathered store they have, That shall condemn them. National disgrace Rests on the country cursed by such a piteous case. XLVIII And yet not once, nor twice, but countless times, We, in blind worship of the golden calf, Allow of deaths like these! While funeral chimes Toll for the rich, whose graven paragraph Of vanished virtues (too complete by half), The heirs of their importance soothe and please. The poor man dies—and hath no epitaph! What if your churchyards held such lines as these, The listless eye to strike,—the careless heart to freeze? XLIX “Here lies a man who died of Hunger-pain, In a by-street of England's Capital. Honest, (in vain!) industrious, (in vain!) Willing to spend in useful labour all His years from youth to age. A dangerous fall Shattered his limbs, and brought him to distress. His health returned: his strength was past recall: He asked assistance (earnings growing less,) Received none, struggled on, and died of Want's excess.” L “Here rests in Death, (who rested not in Life!) The worn-out Mother of a starving brood: By night and day, with most courageous strife, She fought hard Fortune to procure them food: (A desert-pelican, whose heart's best blood Oozed in slow drops of failing strength away!) Much she endured; much misery withstood; At length weak nature yielded to decay, And baffled Famine seized his long-resisting prey.” LI Oh! the green mounds, that have no head-stones o'er them, To tell who lies beneath, in slumber cold; Oh! the green mounds, that saw no Mutes deplore them, The Pauper-Graves, for whom no church-bells tolled; What if our startled senses could behold, (As we to Sabbath-prayer walk calmly by,) Their visionary epitaphs enrolled; Upstanding grimly 'neath God's equal sky, Near the white sculptured tombs where wealthier Christians lie! LII Then we should think: then we should cry, Alas! Then many a pulse would flutter mournfully, And steps would pause, that now so reckless pass: For, in this chequered world of ours, we see Much Carelessness, but little Cruelty; And (though Heaven knows it is no boast to tell,) There dwelleth in us a deep sympathy, Too often, like the stone-closed Arab well, Sealed from their helpless thirst whose torments it should quell. LIII We shelter Selfishness behind the mask Of Incredulity: we will not own What, if admitted, leaves a heavy task To be performed; or spurned if left undone, Stamping our frozen hearts as made of stone. Or, if we grant such suffering exists, Wide-spread and far, we plead,—“how vain for One “To strive to clear away these hopeless mists, “Striking a few sad names from off these endless lists!” LIV “What can I do? I know that men have died “Of their privations; truly, I believe “That honest labour may be vainly plied: “But how am I this sorrow to relieve? “Go, let our Rulers some great plan achieve, “It rests with These to settle and command,— “We, meaner souls, can only sigh and grieve.” So, sitting down, with slack and nerveless hand, Supine we hear the cry that waileth through the land. LV But let us measure help, by their deep woe: Are we, indeed, as powerless to aid As they to struggle? Conscience whispers, “No!” Conscience, who shrinks uneasy and afraid, Condemned,—if that brief answer must be made. Though, in the Cowardice that flies the pain, A spark of better nature is betrayed, Proving, if their appeal could entrance gain, Our hearts would not be roused and spoken to in vain. LVI But because generous minds stand few and far, Like wholesome ears of grain in fields of blight:— Because one earnest soul, like one great star, Rises,—without the power in single light To break the darkness of surrounding night:— Because the sufferings of the Mass require The Many, not the Few, their wrongs to right;— Therefore, Great Hearts grow sick with vain desire, And, baffled at each turn, the weaker spirits tire. LVII The Gradual is God's law. And we all fail Because we will not copy it, but would Against deep-rooted obstacles prevail, (Which have the change of centuries withstood) By hurried snatching in our rashest mood: So, leaving dying branches in our grasp, Vanishes all the growth of promised good; Or from the green leaves darts some poisonous asp, And stings the hand outstretched the fruitage fair to clasp. LVIII So the Mock-Patriot leaves the Poor man's home A thousand times more wretched, than when first Loud declamation, full of froth and foam, Weak discontent to strong rebellion nurst! By those to whom he proffered aid, accurst,— Called to account for days of helpless woe,— The bubble promises give way, and burst, Which left his rash lips with such ready flow: The Idol of Himself,—the Orator for show! LIX Solemn the malediction set on him Who doth “pervert the judgment” of the poor, Mislead the blind and ignorant, and dim The meagre light which led them heretofore. Faces he knows not,—weak ones who deplore The ruin wrought by him,—in dreams shall rise; Night's veil of darkness cannot cover o'er The wild reproaching of their blood-shot eyes, Nor its deep silence hush their hoarse lamenting cries! LX While those whom he opposed, pronounce it Sin, That, with mad Discord in his meteor track, Some shallow theory of hope to win, He hounded on a wild infuriate pack: The feet he taught to leave the quiet track, Who shall prevent, or whither shall they tread? What mighty force shall dam the waters back, When the swoln torrent hath found room to spread? Rolling and fierce it comes, and whelms his reckless head! LXI Yet, let no man who feels himself secure That Wrong exists, believe that humble tools May not amend, what pining they endure. Let him not fear the ridicule of fools, Nor sneers of cold utilitarian schools, To whom enthusiasts ever seem insane: Nor to old laws and inappropriate rules Bow slavish down because his lot is plain, Unstarred by Rank or Power, ungilt by Wealth or Gain. LXII What! were they demi-gods and angels, then, Who have done deeds of glory in our land? Or only honest, earnest-hearted men, Born their great mission here to understand, And nobly labour at it, heart and hand? Were they all Princes and great Lords, who trod Their share of Earth in natural command? No! they believed the Breath that woke the clod, And honoured in themselves the sentient spark from God! LXIII He did not breathe a different breath of life Into the noble and the lowly born: Sprung from one clay, though now in parted strife, Brothers,—though some may crouch and some may scorn. We framed a difference, such as bids the Morn Shine veiled or bright; but, sent through latticed pane, Or mullioned arch, or prison-bars forlorn, Or gleaming through dim aisles with painted stain, God's outward light it was, God's light it must remain! LXIV Not in the body, or the body's gauds,— Not in the coronet a goldsmith wrought,— Not in the pomp a gaping crowd applauds (Like a pleased child when spangled toys are brought,) But in the proud pre-eminence of Thought Lies the true influence that shall aspire: The Victory in a battle mutely fought: For that light, none can trample out,—that fire The breath of fierce disdain but teaches to rise higher! LXV Hath Science, in her march, avowed no claims But theirs, first trained in Academic letters? Doth History give no roll of patriot-names, Peasants themselves, of peasant sons begetters, Who taught that light to some, miscalled their Betters? Men, who with iron hands, and hearts as stout, Filed through the links of Folly's golden fetters; And rough smith's work they made of it, no doubt, Small choice of tools, when Souls from Prison would break out. LXVI Yet doubly beautiful it is to see One, set in the temptation of High Class, Keep the inherent deep nobility Of a great nature, strong to over-pass The check of circumstance and choking mass Of vicious faults which youthful leisure woo; Mirror each thought in Honour's stainless glass; And, by all kindly deeds that Power can do, Prove that the brave good heart hath come of lineage true. LXVII His gladdest welcome shall be giv'n by those Who seemed to hold aloof from gentle blood: Men, falsely deemed Rank's democratic foes, Because they love not Fashion's selfish brood, And look on idle Pomp with bitter mood. Straightforward is their judgment; true, and keen; The English Oak disowns the grafted wood,— Spurns the high title, linked with spirit mean,— And scorns the branch whereon the Lowly dare not lean! LXVIII Oh! Graceful seems the bending of his brow; Lovely the earnestness that fills his eyes; Holy the fire that gave his heart its glow (Spark of that same great Light which never dies.) With hope, not fear, they watch his gradual rise:— His youth's glad service in his age recall:— Cheer in the race,—and glory in the prize,— For his sake loving Rank, and Pomp, and all,— Deeming such statue needs a lofty Pedestal! LXIX Child of the Islands! May such men as these Alone be teachers of thy childhood pure; Greet thy fair youth with friendly courtesies, And to thine age with happy bond endure. Feel with them; act with them; those ills to cure That lie within the reach of brotherhood; For these are men no shallow hopes allure, Whose loyalty is current in their blood, But who the people's claims have wisely understood. LXX Hear a brief fable. One, with heedless tread, Came o'er the wild fair grass that ne'er was mown: Then said the grass,—“Your heel is on my head; And, where in harmless freedom I have grown, Sorely your iron foot hath tramped me down; But God,—who to my veins such freshness gave, Shall heal me with a healing of his own, Till I, perchance, may lift my head to wave Above the marble tomb that presses down your grave.” LXXI If he had trod the path within his reach, And let the wild grass hear the cricket sing, Think you it would have turned with bitter speech? No! but saluted him as Nature's king. Oh, fable,—but not folly,—for the thing We trample down, if life from God be in it, Sooner or later takes the upward spring; And sorely we may rue the reckless minute We strove to crush its strength, and not in peace to win it. LXXII And not alone in this same trampling strife Consists Oppression's force; that creeping eft, That lizard-blooded, frozen death-in-life, Neutrality, the cursed of Heaven, hath left More misery to be borne by those bereft Of power to strive against ill-fortune's spite. The dagger hath gone home unto the heft; And those stood by, who would not, but who might Have turned the assassin steel, and stayed the unequal fight. LXXIII Oh! there are moments of our lives, when such As will not help to lift us, strike us down! When the green bough just bends so near our clutch, When the light rope so easily were thrown, That they are murderers who behold us drown. Well spoke the Poet-Heart so tried by woe, That there are hours when left despairing, lone, “Each idle On-looker appears a Foe:” For Hate can scarce do worse, than no compassion show. LXXIV Neutrality is Hate: the aid withheld, Flings its large balance in the adverse scale; And makes the enemy we might have quelled, Strong to attack, and certain to prevail; Yea, clothes him, scoffing, in a suit of mail! Those are the days which teach unhappy elves No more such callous bosoms to assail; The rocky soil no more the weak-one delves; Upright we stand, and trust—in God, and in ourselves. LXXV “The flesh will quiver when the pincers tear;” The heart defies, that feels unjustly slighted; The soul, oppressed, puts off its robe of Fear, And warlike stands, in gleaming armour dighted; And whensoe'er the Wronged would be the Righted, There always have been, always must be, minds In whom the Power and Will are found united; Who rise, as Freedom fit occasion finds, Skilled Workmen in a Craft which no Apprentice binds. LXXVI And therefore should we aid who need our aid, And freely give to those who need our giving; Look gently on a brother's humbler trade, And the coarse hand that labours for its living, Scorn not because our fortunes are more thriving; Spurn the cold rule,—“all Barter, no Bestowing,” And such good plans as answer our contriving, Let no false shame deter from open shewing;— The crystal spring runs pure,—though men behold it flowing. LXXVII But granting we in truth were weak to do That which our hearts are strong enough to dream; Shall we, as feeble labourers, wandering go, And sit down passive by the lulling stream, Or slumber basking in the noon-tide beam? Shall we so waste the hours without recall, Which o'er Life's silent dial duly gleam; And from red morning to the dewy fall, Folding our listless hands, pursue no aim at all? LXXVIII Would not the lip with mocking smile be curled, If some poor reaper of our autumn corn, Some hired labourer of the actual world, Treated our summons with neglect forlorn; Pleading that Heaven, which made him weakly-born, Had thus excused him from all settled task? Should we not answer, with a kind of scorn, “Do what thou canst,—no more can Reason ask, But think not, unemployed, in idleness to bask?” LXXIX In Heaven's own land,—the heart,—shall we put by All tasks to Us allotted and assigned,— While thus the mote within a Brother's eye Clearly we see, but to the beam are blind? How can we set that reaper sheaves to bind, According to his body's strength; yet seek Excuse for our soul's indolence to find? Oh! let the red shame flush the conscious cheek,— For duties planned by God, no man was born too weak! LXXX Task-work goes through the world! the fluent River Turneth the mill-wheels with a beating sound, And rolleth onward toward the sea for ever! The Sea heaves restless to its shoreward bound; The Winds with varying voices, wander round; The Branches, in their murmur, bend and thrill; Flower after flower springs freshly from the ground; The floating Clouds move ceaseless o'er the hill; Nothing is set in calm; nothing (save Death) is still. LXXXI That glorious orb of Heaven, the blessèd Sun, A daily journey makes from East to West; Nightly the Moon and Stars their courses run. Yea, further we may learn our Lord's behest, Taught by the pulse that heaves each living breast, Our folding of the hands is in the Grave And fixed in Heaven the Sabbath of our Rest! Meanwhile, with Sun, and Wind, and Cloud, and Wave, We ply the life-long task our great Creator gave. LXXXII Child of the Islands! when to thy young heart Life's purpose pleads with mighty eloquence,— Hear, Thou, as one who fain would act his part Under the guiding of Omnipotence; Whose clay-wrapped Spirit, looking up from hence, Asketh what labour it may best perform Ere the Night cometh; when quick life and sense Are fellow-sleepers with the slow blind worm,— And Death's dark curtain hides the sunshine and the storm! END OF AUTUMN. WINTER. THE ARGUMENT. The Snow on the Graves in the Churchyards of England—The Snow in Affghanistan—The Soldier's Glory—Arthur Wellesley—Arthur, Duke of Wellington—Different Destinies—The Worn-out Veteran—The Blind Man's Winter—Almsgiving—Expensive Pleasures—The Ballet-Dancer—Christmas Carols—Christmas Privations—Sickness among the Poor—Kindness of the Poor to each other—Contrast of the Sick Rich Man and Sick Poor Man—Decline of Life—The Fear and the Hope of Meeting God—“The Child of the Islands”—His Share of what Winter brings. I Ere the Night cometh! On how many graves Rests, at this hour, their first cold winter's snow! Wild o'er the earth the sleety tempest raves; Silent, our Lost Ones slumber on below; Never to share again the genial glow Of Christmas gladness round the circled hearth; Never returning festivals to know, Or holidays that mark some loved one's birth, Or children's joyous songs, and loud delighted mirth. II The frozen tombs are sheeted with one pall,— One shroud for every churchyard, crisp and bright,— One foldless mantle, softly covering all With its unwrinkled width of spotless white. There, through the grey dim day and starlit night, It rests, on rich and poor, and young and old,— Veiling dear eyes,—whose warm home-cheering light Our pining hearts can never more behold,— With an unlifting veil,—that falleth blank and cold. III The Spring shall melt that snow,—but kindly eyes Return not with the Sun's returning powers,— Nor to the clay-cold cheek, that buried lies, The living blooms that flush perennial flowers,— Nor, with the song-birds, vocal in the bowers, The sweet familiar tones! In silence drear We pass our days,—and oft in midnight hours Call madly on their names who cannot hear,— Names graven on the tombs of the departed year! IV There lies the tender Mother, in whose heart So many claimed an interest and a share! Humbly and piously she did her part In every task of love and household care: And mournfully, with sad abstracted air, The Father-Widower, on his Christmas Eve, Strokes down his youngest child's long silken hair, And, as the gathering sobs his bosom heave, Goes from that orphaned group, unseen to weep and grieve. V Feeling his loneliness the more this day Because She kept it with such gentle joy, Scarce can he brook to see his children play, Remembering how her love it did employ To choose each glittering gift and welcome toy: His little timid girl, so slight of limb,— His fearless, glorious, merry-hearted boy,— They coax him to their sports,—nor know how dim The Christmas taper's light must burn henceforth for him! VI Ah! when these two are wrapt in peaceful sleep, His worn eyes on the sinking embers set, A Vigil to her Memory shall keep! Her bridal blush when first his love she met,— Her dying words of meek and fond regret,— Her tearful thanks for all his kindness past,— These shall return to him,—while linger yet The last days of the year,—that year the last Upon whose circling hours her sunny smile was cast! VII Life's Dial now shows blank, for want of Her: There shall be holiday and festival, But each his mourning heart shall only stir With repetitions of her funeral: Quenched is the happy light that used to fall On common things, and bid them lustre borrow: No more the daily air grows musical, Echoing her soft good night and glad good morrow, Under the snow she lies,—and he must grieve down sorrow! VIII And learn how Death can hallow trivial things; How the eyes fill with melancholy tears When some chance voice a common ballad sings The Loved sang too, in well-remembered years,— How strangely blank the beaten track appears Which led them to the threshold of our door,— And how old books some pencilled word endears; Faint tracery, where our dreaming hearts explore Their vanished thoughts whose souls commune with us no more! IX Under the snow she lies! And there lies too The young fair blossom, neither Wife nor Bride; Whose Child-like beauty no man yet might woo, Dwelling in shadow by her parent's side Like a fresh rosebud, which the green leaves hide. Calm as the light that fades along the West, When not a ripple stirs the azure tide, She sank to Death: and Heaven knows which is best, The Matron's task fulfilled, or Virgin's spotless rest. X A quiet rest it is: though o'er that form We wept, because our human love was weak! Our Dove's white wings are folded from the storm,— Tears cannot stain those eyelids pure and meek,— And pale for ever is the marble cheek Where, in her life, the shy quick-gushing blood Was wont with roseate eloquence to speak; Ebbing and flowing with each varying mood Of her young timid heart, so innocently good! XI And, near her, sleeps the old grey-headed Sire, Whose faded eyes, in dying prayer uplifted, Taught them the Truth who saw him thus expire, (Although not eloquent or greatly gifted) Because they saw the winnowing fan that sifted Chaff from the grain, disturbed not his high Trust: In the dark storm, Hope's anchor never drifted, The dread funereal sentence, “Dust to Dust,” No terror held for him who slumbers with the Just. XII There, too, is laid the son of many vows; The stately heir—the treasure of his home: His early death hath saddened noble brows, Yet to grieved hearts doth consolation come: Where shall they find, though through the world they roam, A star as perfect, and as radiant clear? Like Ormonde's Ossory, in his early doom, The throb of triumph checks the rising tear; No living son can be their dead Son's proud compeer. XIII He was not called to leave temptations hollow, And orgies wild, and bacchanalian nights: Where vice led on, his spirit scorned to follow: His soul, self-exiled from all low delights, Mastered the strength of sensual appetites: Great plans, good thoughts, alone had power to move him, Holy Ambition, such as Heaven requites: His heart, (as they best know who used to love him,) Was young, and warm, but pure, as the white snow above him. XIV He sleeps! And she, his young betrothèd bride, Sleeps too,—her beauty hid in winding-sheet: The blind tears, freely shed for both, are dried; And round their silent graves the mourner's feet Have ceased to echo: but their souls shall meet In the far world, where no sad burial chime Knells for departed life; but, endless sweet, In purity, and love, and joy sublime, Eternal Hope survives all past decays of Time. XV And there, rests One, whom none on earth remember Except that heart whose fond life fed its own! The cherished babe, who, through this bleak December, Far from the Mother's bosom, lieth lone, Where the cold North-wind makes its wintry moan. A flower, whose beauty cannot be renewed; A bird, whose song beyond the cloud is gone; A child, whose empty cradle is bedewed By bitter-falling tears in hours of solitude! XVI Ah! how can Death untwist the cord of Love, Which bid those parted lives together cling? Prest to the bosom of that brooding Dove, Into those infant eyes would softly spring A sense of happiness and cherishing: The tender lips knew no completed word,— The small feet could not run for tottering,— But a glad silent smile the red mouth stirred, And murmurs of delight whene'er her name was heard! XVII Oh! Darling, since all life for death is moulded, And every cradled head some tomb must fill,— A little sooner only hast thou folded Thy helpless hands, that struggled and are still: A little sooner thy Creator's will Hath called thee to the Life that shall endure; And, in that Heaven his gathered saints shall fill, Hath “made thy calling and election sure.” His work in thee being done, was thy death premature? XVIII Baptised,—and so from sin innate reclaimed,— Pure from impure,—Redemption's forfeit paid,— Too young to be for wilful errors blamed,— Thy Angel, little Child so lowly laid, For ever looketh upward, undismayed! No earthly trespass, clouding Heaven's clear light, Casts the Great Glory into dreadful shade: We weep for thee by day,—we weep by night,— Whilst thou beholdest God with glad enraptured sight! XIX Whom call we prematurely summoned? All In whom some gleams of quivering sense remain: Leaves not quite rotted yellow to their fall, Flowers not yet withered dry in every vein: All who depart ere stress of mortal pain Makes that which crushes pain a blessed boon: The extremest verge of life we would attain,— And come he morning, evening, night, or noon, Death, which must come to all, still comes to all too soon. XX For either,—being young,—a bitter strife Divides the parent's heart 'twixt woe and wonder, Or, being set and planted in mid-life, So many earthward roots are torn asunder, The stroke falls blasting like the shock of thunder! Or, being old, and good, and fit to die, The greater is their loss who sheltered under That tree's wide-spreading branches! Still we sigh, And, craving back our Dead, lament them where they lie! XXI Yet there, the pangs of mortal grief are o'er! Pictures and lockets worn in Love's wild fever, Rest on unthrobbing hearts: ears hear no more Harsh words, which uttered once must haunt for ever, Despite forgiving wish, and sad endeavour:— Maniacs, whom fellow-creatures feared and bound, Learn the dread fastening of their chain to sever; Those bloodshot eyes, that glared so wildly round, Sealed in eternal calm, and closed in holy ground. XXII Peace comes to those, who, restless and forlorn, Wasting in doubt's cold torment, day by day, Watched alienated eyes for fond return Of Love's warm light for ever passed away. Ah, fools! no second morn's renewing ray Gilds the blank Present, like the happy Past; Madly ye built, 'mid ruin and decay,— Striving Hope's anchor in the sand to cast, And, drifting with the storm, made shipwreck at the last! XXIII There your Philosophers and Poets dwell: Your great Inventors,—men of giant mind; The hearts that rose with such a mighty swell, How little earth sufficeth now to bind! Heroes and Patriots, Rulers of their kind, Ambitious Statesmen, flatterers of the Throne, All, in this lowly rest, their level find: The weakness of their mortal strength laid down Beneath the mouldering leaves of Glory's laurelled crown. XXIV And high above them, on the cypress bough, The little winter robin, all day long, Slanting his bright eye at the dazzling snow, Sings with a loud voice and a cheerful song: While round about, in many a clustering throng, The tufted snowdrop lifts its gentle head, And bird and flower, in language mute yet strong, Reprove our wailing for the happy dead, And, by their joy, condemn the selfish tears we shed. XXV For Snowdrops are the harbingers of Spring,— A sort of link between dumb life and light,— Freshness preserved amid all withering,— Bloom in the midst of grey and frosty blight,— Pale Stars that gladden Nature's dreary night! And well the Robin may companion be, Whose breast of glowing red, like embers bright, Carries a kindling spark from tree to tree, Lighting the solemn yew where darkness else would be. XXVI The Rose is lovely fair, and rich in scent, The Lily, stately as a cloistered nun, The Violet, with its sweet head downward bent, The Polyanthus, in the noon-day sun, And Blue-bell swinging where the brooklets run: But all these grow in summer hours of mirth; Only the Snowdrop cometh forth alone, Peering above the cold and niggard earth, Then bending down to watch the soil that gave it birth. XXVII Seeming to say,—“Behold, your Dead lie here, “Beneath the heavy mould whose burial sound “Smote with such horror on your shrinking ear “When the dark coffin sank beneath the ground: “Yet therefrom spring these flowers that quiver round, “Their frail bells trembling o'er the damp cold sod. “Fear not, nor doubt—your lost ones shall be found; “For they, like us, shall burst the valley clod, “And, in white spotless robes, rise up to light and God!” XXVIII Oh! nothing cheerless dwelleth by the tomb, And nothing cheerless in the wintry sky; They are asleep whose bed is in that gloom; They are at rest who in that prison lie, And have no craving for their liberty! They hear no storm; the clear frost chills them not, When the still solemn stars shine out on high; The dreamless slumber of the grave shall blot All record of dull pain and suffering from their lot! XXIX Theirs was the Dreadful Snow,—who, hand to hand, Bravely, but vainly, massacre withstood, In the dark passes of the Indian land, Where thoughts of unforgotten horror brood! Whose cry for mercy, in despairing mood, Rose in a language foreign to their foes, Groaning and choking in a sea of blood, No prayer—no hymn to soothe their last repose, No calm and friendly hands their stiffening eyes to close! XXX Theirs was the Dreadful Snow,—who trembling bore Their shuddering limbs along; and pace by pace Saw in that white sheet plashed with human gore The dread familiar look of some brave face,— Distorted,—ghastly,—with a lingering trace Of life and sorrow in its pleading glance,— A dying dream of parted Love's embrace,— A hope of succour, brought by desperate chance,— Or wild unconscious stare of Death's delirious trance. XXXI Theirs was the Dreadful Snow,—who left behind Brothers and husbands, foully, fiercely slain: Who, led by traitors, wandered on, half blind With bitter tears of sorrow, shed in vain, Crossing the steep ascent, or dreary plain; Mothers of helpless children,—delicate wives, Who brought forth wailing infants, born in pain, Amid a crowded wreck of human lives, And scenes that chill the soul, though vital strength survives. XXXII Theirs was the Dreadful Snow,—who never laid Their Dead to rest with service and with psalm: Their bones left bleaching in the alien shade Of mountains crested with the Indian Palm. Oh! English village graves, how sweet and calm Shines on your native earth the setting sun! Yet Glory gave their wounds a healing balm— Glory,—like that thy youthful trophies won In thy first “prime of life,”—victorious Wellington! XXXIII “In thy life's prime,”—ere yet the fading grey Had blanched the tresses of thy gallant head: Or from thy step Time's gradual faint decay Stole the proud bearing of a Soldier's tread! Gone are the troops thy voice to battle led,— Thy conquering hand shall wield the sword no more,— The foes and comrades of thy youth are dead,— By Elba's rock and lone St. Helen's shore No prisoned Emperor hears the boundless ocean roar. XXXIV But, though its battle-strength be out of date, The eager gesture of that warrior hand,— Raised in the warmth of brief and blunt debate In the hushed Senate of thy native land,— Hath something in it of the old command; The voice retains a certain power to thrill Which cheered to Victory many a gallant band: In thy keen sense, and proud unconquered will, Though thy Life's Prime be past, men own their Leader still! XXXV Plodding his way along the winter path, Behold, a different lot hard fortune shews: A blind old veteran in the tempest's wrath, Around whose feet no fabled laurel grows. Long hath he dwelt in an enforced repose; And, when the tales of glorious deeds are heard, His sightless countenance with pleasure glows,— His brave old heart is for a moment stirred,— Then, sad he shrinks away, muttering some mournful word. XXXVI For ever idle in this work-day world— For ever lonely in the moving throng— Like a seared leaf by eddying breezes whirled, Hither and thither vaguely borne along: No guide to steer his course, if right or wrong, Save the dumb immemorial friend of man, Who, by some instinct delicate and strong, From those impassive glances learns to scan Some wish to move or rest,—some vestige of a plan: XXXVII The wildbird's carol in the pleasant woods Is all he knows of Spring! The rich perfume Of flowers, with all their various scented buds, Tells him to welcome Summer's heavy bloom: And by the wearied gleaners trooping home,— The heavy tread of many gathering feet,— And by the laden Waggon-loads that come Brushing the narrow hedge with burden sweet,— He guesses Harvest in, and Autumn's store complete. XXXVIII But in God's Temple the great lamp is out; And he must worship glory in the Dark! Till Death, in midnight mystery, hath brought The veiled Soul's re-illuminating spark,— The pillar of the Cloud enfolds the ark! And, like a man that prayeth underground In Bethlehem's rocky shrine, he can but mark The lingering hours by circumstance and sound, And break with gentle hymns the solemn silence round. XXXIX Yet still Life's Better Light shines out above! And in that village church where first he learned To bear his cheerless doom for Heaven's dear love, He sits, with wistful face for ever turned To hear of those who Heavenly pity earned: Blind Bartimeus, and him desolate Who for Bethesda's waters vainly yearned: And inly sighs, condemned so long to wait, Baffled and helpless still, beyond the Temple gate! XL And can the Blind man miss the Summer sun? This wintry sheet of wide unbroken white His sealed blank eyes undazzled rest upon; Yet round him hangs all day a twofold night, He felt the warmth, who never saw the light! He loved to sit beside the cottage door When blossoms of the gorse were golden bright, And hear glad children's shouts come o'er the moor, And bask away his time in happy dreams of yore. XLI The Sunbeam slanting down on bench or bank Was, unto him, a sweet consoling friend; Such as our mournful hearts incline to thank, But that such thanks affection's depth offend. All vanished pictures it had power to send That greeted his keen eyesight, long ago! Gay plumèd troops defiling without end,— And glancing bayonets and martial show,— And hands he used to grasp,—and looks he used to know. XLII Yea, sometimes, back again to earlier life, Even to his childish days, his thoughts would steal; And hear, in lieu of arms and clashing strife, The low hum of his Mother's spinning wheel,— And on his withered cheek her lips could feel As when she kissed its boyish sunburnt bloom: And fancy little acts of love and zeal, By which she now would soothe his bitter doom: But she is dead,—and he,—alone in all his gloom! XLIII Oh! by the beauty of a Summer day,— The glorious blue that on the fountain lies,— The tender quivering of the fresh green spray,— The softness of the night when stars arise; By the clear gladness of your children's eyes,— And the familiar sweetness of that face Most welcome to you underneath the skies,— Pity that fellow-creature's mournful case Whom Darkness follows still, where'er his dwelling-place! XLIV “Pity the Blind!” How oft, in dolent tone, That cry is heard along the peopled street, While the Brute-Guide with patient care leads on The tardy groping of his Master's feet! But little dream we, as those steps we meet, We too are blind, though clear the visual ray That gives us leave familiar looks to greet, Smiling and pausing on our onward way: We too are blind,—and dark the paths wherein we stray. XLV Yea, blind! and adder-deaf,—and idiot-dull,— To many a sight and sound that cries aloud. Is there no moral blindness of the Soul? Is he less shut from light, who, through the crowd Threads his blank way, among the poor and proud,— The foul and fair,—all forms to him the same,— Than they whose hearts have never yet avowed Perception of the universal claim Wrapped in that common phrase, a “fellow-creature's” name. XLVI Christmas is smiling at the Rich man's door,— Its joyous holiday his home endears: Christmas is frowning on the thin-clad Poor, With looks of cold distress and frozen tears: How plain the duty of the time appears! But Selfishness is Blindness of the Heart; And, having eyes, we see not; having ears, We hear not warnings, which should make us start, While God's good angels watch the acting of our part. XLVII Now, slowly trudging through the crispèd snow, Under the wintry arch of Heaven's clear dome, Joy's cadenced music set to tones of woe, Beneath the windows of the rich man's home Street-Singers, with their Christmas Carols, roam. Ah! who shall recognise that sound again, Nor think of him, who hallowed years to come, When the past Christmas taught his fervent pen A “Carol” of dear love and brotherhood 'twixt men! XLVIII To what good actions that small book gave birth, God only knows, who sends the wingèd seed To its appointed resting-place on earth! What timely help in hours of sorest need,— What gentle lifting of the bruisèd reed,— What kind compassion shewn to young and old,— Proved the true learning of its simple creed,— We know not,—but we know good thoughts, well told, Strike root in many a heart, and bear a hundred-fold! XLIX Oh, lovely lesson! art thou hard to learn? Is it indeed so difficult to share The school-boy hoard our efforts did not earn? Shall we still grudge life's luck, to lives of care, And dream that what we spend on these, we spare? Alms being the exception, Self the rule, Still shall we give our guinea here and there (“Annual”) to church, and hospital, and school, And lavish hundreds more, on pleasures which befool. L Take but the aggregate of several sums Allotted for the privilege to stay, Watching some dancer's feet, who onward comes Light as a bird upon a bending spray: When,—oh! thou custom-governed Conscience,—say, Did niggard Charity at once bestow What careless Pleasure squanders every day? When did the tale of real and squalid woe Awake within thy breast such sympathetic glow? LI Prosaic Questioner, thy words beguile No listener's ear: She curtsies, gazing round: Who would not spend a fortune on her smile! How curved the stately form prepared to bound With footfall echoing to the music's sound, In the Cachucha's proud triumphant pace! What soft temptation in her look is found When the gay Tarantalla's wilder grace Wakes all th' impassioned glow that lights her Southern face! LII And now, a peasant girl, abashed she stands: How pretty and how timid are her eyes: How gracefully she clasps her small fair hands, How acts her part of shy and sweet surprise: How earnest is her love without disguise: How piteously, when from that dream awaking, She finds him false on whom her faith relies, All the arch mirth those features fair forsaking, She hides her face and sobs as though her heart were breaking! LIII A Sylphide now, among her bowers of roses, Or, by lone reeds, a Lake's enamoured fairy, Her lovely limbs to slumber she composes, Or flies aloft, with gestures soft and airy: Still on her guard when seeming most unwary, Scarce seen, before the small feet twinkle past, Haunting, and yet of love's caresses chary, Her maddened lover follows vainly fast,— While still the perfect step seems that she danced the last! LIV Poor Child of Pleasure! thou art young and fair, And youth and beauty are enchanting things: But hie thee home, bewitching Bayadère, Strip off thy glittering armlets, pearls, and rings, Thy peasant boddice, and thy Sylphide wings: Grow old and starve: require true Christian aid: And learn, when real distress thy bosom wrings, For whom was all that costly outlay made: For Self, and not for thee, the golden ore was paid! LV For the quick beating of the jaded heart, When sated Pleasure woke beneath thy gaze, And heaved a languid sigh, alone, apart, Half for thy beauty, half for “other days:” For the trained skill thy pliant form displays, Pleasing the eye and casting o'er the mind A spell which, Circé-like, thy power could raise, A drunkenness of Soul and Sense combined, Where Fancy's filmy Veil gross Passion's form refined. LVI For these, while thou hadst beauty, youth, and health, Thou supple-limbed and nimble-stepping slave Of two cold masters, Luxury and Wealth, The wages of thy task they duly gave, Thy food was choice, and thy apparel brave: Appeal not now to vanished days of joy For arguments to succour and to save,— Proud Self indulgence hath a newer toy, And younger slaves have skill, and these thy Lords employ. LVII And thou, first flatterer of her early prime, Ere praises grew familiar as the light, And the young feet flew round in measured time Amid a storm of clapping every night; Thou, at whose glance the smile grew really bright That decked her lips for tutored mirth before,— Wilt thou deny her and forget her quite? Thy idol, for whose sake the lavish store In prodigal caprice thy hand was wont to pour? LVIII Yea, wherefore not? for Self, and not for her, Those sums were paid, her facile love to win: Thy heart's cold ashes vainly would she stir, The light is quenched she looked so lovely in! Eke out the measure of thy fault, and sin “First with her, then against her,” cast her off, Though on thy words her faith she learned to pin: The World at her, and not at thee, shall scoff,— Yea, lowlier than before, its servile cap shall doff. LIX And since these poor forsaken ones are apt With ignorant directness to perceive Only the fact that gentle links are snapt, Love's perjured nonsense taught them to believe Would last for ever: since to mourn and grieve Over these broken vows is to grow wild: It may be she will come, some winter eve, And, weeping like a broken-hearted child, Reproach thee for the days when she was thus beguiled. LX Then,—in thy spacious library,—where dwell Philosophers, Historians, and Sages, Full of deep lore which thou hast studied well; And classic Poets, whose melodious pages Are shut, like birds, in lacquered trellis cages,— Let thy more educated mind explain By all experience of recorded ages, How commonplace is this her frantic pain, And how such things have been, and must be yet again! LXI If the one Book should strike those foreign eyes, And thy professed Religion she would scan,— Learning its shallow influence to despise; Argue thy falsehood on a skilful plan, Protestant, and protesting gentleman! Prove all the folly, all the fault, her own; Let her crouch humbly 'neath misfortune's ban; She hath unlovely, undelightful grown, That sin no words absolve: for that no tears atone! LXII But Prudery,—with averted angry glance,— Bars pleading, and proclaims the sentence just; Life's gambler having lost her desperate chance, Now let the Scorned One grovel in the dust! Now let the Wanton share the Beggar's crust! Yet every wretch destroyed by Passion's lure, Had a First Love,—Lost Hope,—and Broken Trust: And Heaven shall judge whose thoughts and lives are pure, Not always theirs worst sin, who worldly scorn endure. LXIII The Worthlessness of those we might relieve Is chill Denial's favourite pretence: The proneness of the needy to deceive By many a stale and counterfeit pretence,— Their vice,—their folly,—their improvidence. There's not a ragged beggar that we meet, Tuning his voice to whining eloquence, And shuffling towards us with half-naked feet As some rich equipage comes rolling down the street,— LXIV But we prepare that Sinner to condemn, And speak a curse, where we were called to bless: From a corrupted root,—a withered stem; 'Tis gross hypocrisy, and not distress, Or want brought on by loathsome drunkenness, Seen in the wandering of his bloodshot eye Glazed stupid with habitual excess: Even children raise a simulated cry,— Worthless we deem them all,—and worthless pass them by. LXV Nor without reason is the spirit grieved, And wrath aroused for Truth and Justice' sake: The tales by which vile Cunning hath deceived, On calculated chances planned to make Frozen Compassion's sealed-up fountains wake; The affectation of distorted pains; The stealthy dram which trembling fingers take To send the chill blood coursing through the veins From a worn heart which scarce its vital heat retains;— LXVI Craving of gifts to pawn, exchange, or sell;— These are the baser errors of the Poor! What thine are, Almsgiver, thou best canst tell, And how thy spirit its temptations bore, Giving thee now a right to bar the door Against thy fellow-trespasser: his brow Hath lost, perchance, the innocence of yore: The wrestling sin that forced his Soul to bow, He hath not bravely met and overborne: hast Thou? LXVII Oh, different temptations lurk for all! The Rich have idleness and luxury, The Poor are tempted onward to their fall By the oppression of their Poverty: Hard is the struggle—deep the agony When from the demon watch that lies in wait The soul with shuddering terror strives to flee, And idleness—or want—or love—or hate— Lure us to various crimes, for one condemning fate! LXVIII Didst Thou, when sleety blasts at midnight howled, And wretches, clad in Misery's tattered guise, Like starving wolves, it may be, thieved and prowled; Never lie dreaming,—shut from winter skies,— While the warm shadow of remembered eyes, Like a hot sun-glow, all thy frame opprest; And love-sick and unhallowed phantasies Born of a lawless hope, assailed thy breast, And robbed God's solemn night, of Prayer and tranquil rest. LXIX When the great Sunrise, shining from above With an impelling and awakening ray, Found thee so listless in thy sinful love, Thy flushing cheek could only turn away From the clear light of that distasteful day, And, leaning on thy languid hand, invite Darkness again, that fading dreams might stay,— Was God's fair Noon not robbed of Duty's Right, Even as the holy rest was cheated from his night? LXX Whom thou dost injure,—thou that dost not strike,— What thou dost covet,—thou that dost not steal,— He knows, who made Temptations so unlike, But Sin the same: to Him all hearts reveal The Proteus-like disguises which conceal That restless Spirit which doth so beguile And easily beset us: all we feel Of good or bad,—He knows,—and all the vile Degrading earthly stains which secret thought defile. LXXI His eye detects the stealthy murderer's arm Uplifted in the hour of midnight gloom: He sees, through blushes delicately warm, Feigned Innocence her forfeit throne resume, And marks the canker underneath the bloom: But oft the sentence erring man decreed, Finds before Him reversal of its doom: He judgeth all our sorrow—all our need— And pitying bends to hear the sorely tempted plead. LXXII What if by Him more sternly shall be judged Crimes to which no necessity impelled, Than theirs, to whom our human justice grudged Compassion for the weeping we beheld? What if the savage blow that madly felled The object of fierce rage, be lighter deemed Than cruelty where life-blood never welled, But where the hope was quenched that faintly gleamed, And the heart drained of tears which still unpitied streamed? LXXIII What if the village brawl, the drunken bout, The Sabbath-breaking of the skittle-ground, Shall all be sins foregone and blotted out, And in their stead worse Sabbath-breaking found In that which stands not chid for brawling sound; The silent printed libel; which invests A strip of paper with the power to wound,— Where some fair name like dew on nightshade rests, In a coarse gathered heap of foul indecent jests? LXXIV How, if the ignorant clown less vile appears, Than educated stabbers in the dark, Who joyed in matron grief, and girlish tears, And lit in happy homes that quenchless spark The bitterness of doubt: who bid the ark Float over troubled waters for all time; And those who once sang joyous as the lark Bow down in silence; tarnished for no crime; Stung by a trailing snake, and spotted with its slime? LXXV Oh! learnèd, clothed, and cultivated minds, To whom the laws their purpose have declared, Sit ye in judgment but on labouring hinds? Yea, for the poor your censure is not spared! Yet shall the faults they made, the crimes they dared, The errors which ye found so hard to pass, Seem as the faults of children, when compared With the corruption of a different class, When God calls angels forth from this world's buried mass. LXXVI Weigh, weigh and balance nicely as you will The poor man's errors with the poor man's need: The fiat of the Just One liveth still, And Human laws, though blindly men may read, The law of Heaven can never supersede. By the cold light of Wisdom's complex rules Vainly we study hard a different creed,— “Do as ye would be done by” mocks the schools, And mars the shallow craft of worldly-witted fools. LXXVII A careless Giver is the poor man's curse! Think not, by this, absolved of alms to stand; The niggard heart of indolence does worse, Stinting both trouble and the liberal hand. Obey the voice of a divine command; “Remember Mercy!” haply thou shalt save If only one, of all that mournful band, From gaol, or workhouse, or an early grave! Hear, thou,—and Heaven shall hear thy voice for mercy crave. LXXVIII Yea, hear the voice that for compassion calls: Prove him unworthy ere he be denied: Lest, through thy coldness, dismal workhouse walls Blankly enclose him round on every side, And from his eyes God's outward glory hide. There, like a creature pent in wooden shed, He in a bitter darkness shall abide, Duly though sparely clothed, and scantly fed, But pining for the paths his feet were wont to tread. LXXIX There shall his soul, of Nature's sweetness reft, Robbed of the light that came in angel-gleams And on the mind such blessed influence left,— Be filled with dark defying prison-dreams. Cruel the world's enforced relieving seems, Preserving life, but not what made life fair; Stagnant and shut from all life's running streams, His heart sinks down from feverish restless care, Into the weary blank of brutalised Despair! LXXX Where is the gorse-flower on the golden moor? Where the red poppy laughing in the corn? Where the tall lily at the cottage door,— The briar-rose dancing in the breezy morn,— The yellow buttercups of sunshine born,— The daisies spangling all the village green,— The showering blossoms of the scented thorn,— The cowslips that enwreathed the May-day Queen? What hath he done, that these shall never more be seen? LXXXI Oh, flowers! oh, dumb companions on lone hills,— In meadow walks, and lovely loitering lanes,— Whose memory brings fresh air and bubbling rills Amid Life's suffocating fever-pains; For Rich and Poor your equal joy remains! Decrepid age and childhood's careless mirth Alike shall own the power your spell retains: Midst all the fading changes of the earth Your smiles, at least, live on,—immortal in their birth. LXXXII Who, when some inward anger fiercely burned,— Hath trod the fresh green carpet where ye lie, Your soft peace-making faces upward turned, With a dumb worship to the solemn sky,— Nor felt his wrath in shame and sorrow die? Old voices calling to his haunted heart From grassy meadows known in infancy, Playfields whose memory bids a teardrop start, Scenes from a former life whose sunshine dwells apart. LXXXIII When there had been no quarrels—and no deaths— No vacant places in our early home: When blossoms, with their various scented breaths, Were all the pure hearts knew of beauty's bloom, Where earthlier passion yet had found no room: When, from low copse, or sunny upland lawn, We shouted loud for joy, that steps might come Bounding and springing, agile as the fawn,— And “Sleep came with the dew,” and gladness with the dawn. LXXXIV Oh! Flowers, oh! gentle never-failing friends, Which from the world's beginning still have smiled To cheer Life's pilgrim as he onward wends,— Seems not your soothing influence, meek and mild, Like comfort spoken by a little child, Who, in some desperate sorrow, though he knows Nothing of all Life's grieving, dark and wild, An innocent compassion fondly shews, And fain would win us back from fever to repose? LXXXV For morbid folly let my song be chid,— Incur the cynic's proudly withering sneer,— But these are feelings (unexprest) which bid The poor man hold his cottage freedom dear; The matin lark hath thrilled his gladdened ear, With its exulting and triumphant song; The nightingale's sweet notes he loved to hear, In the dim twilight, when the labouring throng All weary from their work, in silence trudged along. LXXXVI The glowing Claudes,—the Poussins,—which your eyes Behold and value,—treasure as you may,— His pictures were the sights you do not prize— The leaf turned yellow by the autumn ray, The woodbine wreath that swung across his way, The sudden openings in the hazel-wood:— He knew no history of Rome's decay, But, where grey tombstones in the churchyard stood, He spelt out all the Past on which his mind could brood. LXXXVII Some humble love-scene of his village lot, Or some obscure Tradition, could invest Field, copse, and stile,—or lone and shadowy spot,— With all the Poetry his heart confest: The old companions that he loved the best Met not in crowds at Fashion's busy call: But loud their merriment, and gay the jest, At statute fair and homely festival: And now, life's path is dark, for he hath lost them all! LXXXVIII Therefore deal gently with his destiny, Which, rightly looked on, differs from your own, Less in the points of feeling, than degree: Contrast the great and generous pity shewn,— The bounteous alms some inquest-hour makes known,— Bestowed by those whose means of self-support Are so precarious,—with the pittance thrown From niggard hands, which only spend for sport, Scattering vain largesse down in Pleasure's idle court. LXXXIX Contrast the rich man, with his ready wealth Feeing a skilled Physician's hand to ease The pang that robs him of that blessing Health, With the poor man's lone hour of fell disease; The wretched ague-fits that burn and freeze, He understands not; but his aching head Is conscious that the wasting arm he sees Grown daily thinner, earns his children's bread, And that they pine and starve around his helpless bed. XC Contrast that terror of the chastening rod Which those to whom so much was giv'n, must feel, With the one anxious hope of meeting God! Of finding all the bliss, the glory real,— The Mercy that their sorrows past shall heal,— The Eternal rest,—the happy equal share,— All that was promised by the Preacher's zeal, When weekly pausing in a life of care, Poor voices joined the rich in thanksgiving and prayer. XCI The stamp of imperfection rests on all Our human intellects have power to plan; 'Tis Heaven's own mark, fire-branded at the fall, When we sank lower than we first began, And the Bad Angel stained the heart of man: The Good our nature struggles to achieve Becomes, not what we would, but what we can:— Ah! shall we therefore idly, vainly grieve, Or coldly turn away, reluctant to relieve? XCII Even now a Radiant Angel goeth forth, A spirit that hath healing on his wings,— And flieth East and West and North and South To do the bidding of the King of Kings: Stirring men's hearts to compass better things, And teaching Brotherhood as that sweet source Which holdeth in itself all blessed springs; And shewing how to guide its silver course, When it shall flood the world with deep exulting force. XCIII And some shall be too indolent to teach,— And some too proud of other men to learn,— And some shall clothe their thoughts in mystic speech, So that we scarce their meaning may discern; But all shall feel their hearts within them burn, (Even those by whom the Holy is denied) And in their worldly path shall pause and turn, Because a Presence walketh by their side, Not of their earthlier mould, but pure and glorified: XCIV And some shall blindly overshoot the mark, Which others, feeble-handed, fail to hit, And some, like that lone Dove who left the ark, With restless and o'erwearied wing to flit Over a world by lurid storm-gleams lit,— Shall seek firm landing for a deed of worth, And see the water-floods still cover it:— For “there are many languages on Earth, But only one in Heaven,” where all good plans have birth. XCV Faint not, oh Spirit, in dejected mood Thinking how much is planned, how little done: Revolt not, Heart, though still misunderstood, For Gratitude, of all things 'neath the sun, Is easiest lost,—and insecurest, won: Doubt not, clear mind, that workest out the Right For the right's sake: the thin thread must be spun, And Patience weave it, ere that sign of might, Truth's Banner, wave aloft, full flashing to the light. XCVI Saw ye the blacksmith with a struggling frown Hammer the sparkle-drifting iron straight,— Saw ye the comely anchor, holding down The storm-tried vessel with its shapely weight? Saw ye the bent tools, old and out of date, The crucibles, and fragments of pale ore,— Saw ye the lovely coronet of state Which in the festal hour a monarch wore, The sceptre and the orb which in her hand she bore? XCVII Saw ye the trudging labourer with his spade Plant the small seedling in the rugged ground,— Saw ye the forest-trees within whose shade The wildest blasts of winter wander round, While the strong branches toss and mock the sound? Saw ye the honey which the bee had hived, By starving men in desert wandering found; And how the soul gained hope, the worn limbs thrived, Upon the gathered store by insect skill contrived? XCVIII Lo! out of Chaos was the world first called, And Order out of blank Disorder came. The feebly-toiling heart that shrinks appalled, In Dangers weak, in Difficulties tame, Hath lost the spark of that creative flame Dimly permitted still on earth to burn, Working out slowly Order's perfect frame: Distributed to those whose souls can learn, As labourers under God, His task-work to discern. XCIX Child of the Islands! Thou art one by birth In whom the weak ones see a human guide: A Lily in the garden of their earth, That toilest not, but yet art well supplied With costly luxuries and robes of pride. Thy word shall lead full many a wavering soul, Behoves thee therefore hold thyself allied With the Mind-Workers, that thy good control May serve His world whose light shines out from pole to pole. C So, when Life's Winter closes on thy toil, And the great pause of Death's chill silence comes,— When seeds of good lie buried in the soil, And labourers rest within their narrow homes,— When dormant Consciousness no longer roams In awe-struck fancy towards that distant land Where no snow falleth, and no ocean foams, But waits the trumpet in the Angel's hand,— Thou may'st be one of those who join Heaven's shining band. END OF WINTER. CONCLUSION. THE ARGUMENT. “The Child of the Islands” tried by none of the ordinary Grievances of this World—Death of the Duke of Orleans; of the late Daughter of the Emperor Alexander; of the Son of Leopold of Belgium; of Charlotte of England and her Son—The common Brotherhood of Man—Death of two Babes in Opposite Ranks of Life—The Existence of Universal Sympathy a Decree of God—“The Child of the Islands”—The Moral of Greatness by Descent and Heritage—The End. I My lay is ended! closed the circling year, From Spring's first dawn to Winter's darkling night; The moan of sorrow, and the sigh of fear, The ringing chords of triumph and delight Have died away,—oh, child of beauty bright,— And all unconscious of my song art thou: With large blue eyes of Majesty and might, And red full lips, and fair capacious brow, No Leader of the World,—but Life's Beginner, now! II Oh, tender human blossom, thou art fair, With such a beauty as the eye perceives Watching a bud of promise rich and rare In the home-shadow of surrounding leaves. Thought, the great Dream-bringer, who joys and grieves Over the visions of her own creating, Resting by Thee, a sigh of pleasure heaves; The fever of her rapid flight abating Amid the golden hopes around thy cradle waiting. III Thou—thou, at least, art happy! For thy sake Heaven speaks reversal of the doom of pain, Set on our Nature when the Demon-Snake Hissed the first lie, a woman's ear to gain, And Eden was lamented for in vain! Thou art not meant, like other men, to thirst For benefits no effort can attain: To struggle on, by Hope's deceiving nurst, And linger still the last, where thou wouldst fain be first. IV The royal canopy above thy head Shall charm away the griefs that others know:— Oh! mocking dream! Thy feet Life's path must tread: The Just God made not Happiness to grow Out of condition: fair the field-flowers blow, Fair as the richer flowers of garden ground; And far more equally are joy and woe Divided,—than they dream, who, gazing round, See but that narrow plot, their own life's selfish bound. V True,—in thy Childhood's Spring thou shalt not taste The bitter toil of factory or mine: Nor the Strong Summer of thy manhood waste In labour vain, and want that bids thee pine: The mellow Autumn of thy calm decline— The sheltered Winter of thy happy Age— Shall see home-faces still around thee shine— No Workhouse threatening, where the heart's sick rage Mopes like a prisoned bird within a cheerless cage. VI True, that, instead of all this weary grief, This cutting off what joy our life affords, This endless pining for denied relief, All Luxury shall hail thee! music's chords Shall woo thee,—and sweet utterance of words In Minstrel singing: Painting shall beguile Thine eye with mimic battles, dark with swords,— Green sylvan landscapes,—beauty's imaged smile,— And books thy leisure hours from worldly cares shall wile. VII There ends the sum of thy Life's holiday! Want shall not enter near thee,—Pleasure shall: But Pomp hath wailed when Poverty looked gay, And Sorrow claims an equal tax from all: Tears have been known from Royal eyes to fall When harvest-trudging clowns went singing by: Sobs have woke echoes in the gilded hall: And, by that pledge of thine Equality, Men hail thee Brother still, though thou art set so high. VIII Death, too, who heeds not poorer men's regret, Neither is subject to the will of Kings; All Thrones, all Empires of the Earth are set Under the vaulted shadow of his wings: He blights our Summers, chills our fairest springs, Nips the fresh bloom of some uncertain flower, Yea, where the fragile tendril closest clings, There doth his gaunt hand pluck, with sudden power, Leaving green burial-mounds, where stood Affection's bower. IX Where is young Orleans? that fair Prince of France, Who 'scaped a thousand threatening destinies Only to perish by a vulgar chance? Lost is the light of the most lovely eyes That ever imaged back the summer skies! Widowed the hapless Wife, who seeks to train Childhood's frail thread of broken memories, So that her Orphan may at least retain The haunting shadow of a Father's face,—in vain! X Oh! Summer flowers, which happy children cull, How were ye stained that year by bitter weeping, When he, the stately and the beautiful, Wrapped in his dismal shroud lay coldly sleeping! The warm breeze through the rustling woods went creeping, The birds with gladdening notes sang overhead: The peasant groups went laughing to their reaping, But, in the gorgeous Palace, rose instead, Sobs,—and lamenting Hymns,—and Masses for the Dead! XI Where, too, is She, the loved and lately wived, The fair-haired Daughter of an Emperor, Born in the time of roses, and who lived A rose's life; one Spring, one Summer more, Dating from Girlhood's blushing days of yore,— Fading in Autumn,—lost in Winter's gloom,— And with the opening year beheld no more? She and her babe lie buried in the tomb, The green bud on the stem,—both withered in the bloom! XII Then, Russia wept! Then, bowing to the dust That brow whereon proud Majesty and Grace Are chiselled as in some ideal bust,— All vain appeared his power, his realm's wide space, And the high blood of his imperial race! He sank,—a grieving man,—a helpless Sire,— Who could not call back to a pale sweet face By might of rule, or Love's intense desire, The light that quivering sank, in darkness to expire. XIII Where is the angel sent as Belgium's heir? Renewing hopes so linked with bitter fears, When our own Charlotte perished young and fair,— The former love of long departed years! That little One is gone from earth's cold tears To smile in Heaven's clear sunshine with the Blest, And in his stead another bud appears. But when his gentle head was laid to rest, Came there not boding dreams to sting his Father's breast? XIV Of Claremont? of that dark December night, When, pale with weary vigils vainly kept,— Crushed by the destiny that looked so bright,— Dark-browed and beautiful, he stood and wept By one who heard him not, but dumbly slept! By one who loved him so, that evermore Her young heart with a fervent welcome leapt To greet his presence! But those pangs are o'er, And Heaven in mercy keeps more smiling days in store. XV God hath built up a bridge 'twixt man and man, Which mortal strength can never overthrow; Over the world it stretches its dark span,— The keystone of that mighty arch is Woe! Joy's rainbow glories visit earth, and go, Melting away to Heaven's far-distant land; But Grief's foundations have been fixed below: Pleasure divides us:—the Divine command Hath made of Sorrow's links a firm connecting band. XVI In the clear morning, when I rose from sleep, And left my threshold for the fresh'ning breeze, There I beheld a grieving woman weep; The shadow of a child was on her knees, The worn heir of her many miseries: “Save him!” was written in her suppliant glance: But I was weaker than its fell disease, And ere towards noon the Dial could advance Death indeed saved her babe from Life's most desperate chance. XVII The sunset of that day,—in splendid halls— Mourning a little child of Ducal race (How fair the picture Memory recalls!) I saw the sweetest and the palest face That ever wore the stamp of Beauty's grace, Bowed like a white rose beat by storms and rain, And on her countenance my eyes could trace, And on her soft cheek, marked with tearful stain, That she had prayed through many a midnight watch in vain. XVIII In both those different homes the babe was dead: Life's early morning closed in sudden night: In both, the bitter tears were freely shed, Lips pressed on lids for ever closed from light, And prayers sobbed forth to God the Infinite. From both, the little one was borne away And buried in the earth with solemn rite. One, in a mound where no stone marked the clay, One, in a vaulted tomb, with funeral array. XIX It was the last distinction of their lot! The same dull earth received their mortal mould: The same high consecration marked the spot A Christian burying-place, for young and old: The same clear stars shone out all calmly cold When on those graves the sunset hour grew dim: And the same God in glory they behold,— For Life's diverging roads all lead to Him Who sits enthroned in light among the Cherubim! XX None could revoke the weeping Beggar's loss,— None could restore the lovely Lady's child,— Else untold sums had been accounted dross To buy, for one, the life that moved and smiled: Else had my heart, by false regret beguiled, Recalled the other from his blest abode: One only power was left by Mercy mild, Leave to give alms,—which gladly I bestowed Where the lone tears had fall'n, half freezing while they flowed. XXI Beautiful Royal Child, that art to me Only the sculptured image of a thought: A type of this world's rank and luxury Through whom the Poet's lesson may be taught: The deeds which are by this world's mercy wrought, Lie in the compass of a narrow bound; Our Life's ability,—which is as nought,— Our Life's duration,—which is but a sound,— And then an echo, heard still faintly lingering round! XXII The sound being sweet, the echo follows it; And noble deeds should hallow noble names: The very Ancestry that points a right To all the old hereditary claims, With a true moral worldly triumph tames. What vanity Earth's riches to amass,— What folly to incur its thousand shames,— When bubble generations rise and pass, So swiftly, by the sand in Time's returning glass! XXIII Pilgrims that journey for a certain time— Weak Birds of Passage crossing stormy seas To reach a better and a brighter clime— We find our parallels and types in these! Meanwhile since Death, and Sorrow, and Disease, Bid helpless hearts a barren pity feel; Why, to the Poor, should checked compassion freeze? Brothers, be gentle to that one appeal,— Want is the only woe God gives you power to heal! FINIS.</field>
