      <field name="fulltext">TO REIGN IS WORTH AMBITION, THO' IN HELL!— Milton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DIABOLIAD. DEDICATION TO THE WORST MAN IN HIS MAJESTY's DOMINIONS. The Devil, grown old, was anxious to prepare A fit Successor for the Infernal Chair. At length, he summon'd forth his chosen band; And thus the Monarch gave his last command: “Expand your sable wings, and speed to Earth “To every Knave of Power, and Imp of Birth, “Statesmen and Peers, these welcome tidings tell, “That I resolve to quit the Throne of Hell: “But, ere I cease to reign, 'twill be my care “From my dear Children to elect an Heir. “For this important end, I now proclaim, “And swear by Satan's high and mighty name, “That ere the posting Sun's resplendent ray “Dawns on the Upper World another day, “With all terrific pomp, I will appear “On the dark, ebon Throne of Hell, to hear “The Claimants of its honours each display “Their titles—to my proud, imperial sway. “This purpose let my favourite Mortals know, “And give them convoy to my realms below.” They heard, and instant soar'd upon the wind; The infernal Regions soon were left behind. By whirlwinds borne, they urge the rapid flight, Till, gently fluttering round the giddy height Of Paul's black, sooty Dome, they unobserv'd alight. In strict obedience to their King's command, The human shape assum'd, along the Strand They bend their course, to where the Scaffold stood That whilom smok'd with streams of royal blood: And where, I trust, if Tyrant Kings succeed To spurn our sacred Laws,—those Kings shall bleed. Here they disperse:—Some take their fav'rite way To those fam'd mansions—where the Sons of Play By trick and rapine share a base reward; Shake the false dye, and pack the ready card: In solemn tone their errand they proclaim, Their high commission, and their Sovereign's name. With joy and wonder struck, the Parties rise! “Hell is worth trying for,” F? cries; Pigeons are left unpluck'd, the game unplay'd, And F? forgets the certain Bett he made; E'en S?l?n feels Ambition fire his breast, And leaves, half-told, the fabricated Jest. Well-pleas'd, th'Infernal Ministers resume Their real forms, and thro' the midnight gloom, On wide-stretch'd wings the eager Claimants bore To the dank darkness of the Stygian shore. The rest of Hell's industrious Band resort To the corrupted Purlieus of the Court; To lure the Statesman from his deep-lay'd scheme, To wake the Courtier from his golden dream, And make the C?b?l?n desire to hold Hell's weighty Sceptre,—for 'tis made of gold. Sure he'd resign for such a tempting fee! Hell's Sceptre far outweighs the golden Key! But cautious H? shrinks, when risks are run, And leaves such Honours for his Eldest Son. Now prowling onwards to the noisome caves Where Prostitution rules her needy slaves, They tempt the Lordling, by Ambition's charms, From the rank pleasures of a Harlot's arms; Then, with the Mortal Croud, they bend their flight To the dark realms of everlasting Night. Lords of the Chamber,—Ministers of State, With Sons of Lords, and Hirelings of the Great; Men whom the Villain only loves, the Worthy hate; Follow'd by Pimps, Bawds, Parasites and Whores, In crouds, approach'd Hell's adamantine doors. As they came onward, Mercury the gay If the Orthodox Critic should here observe, that I have thrown a slight upon his Devil, by introducing so great an Heathen as Mercury to his employment, he will discover, when he lowers his eyes to this part of the page, that I have made the observation before him.—But, if according to some of the ancient Christian Fathers, his Satanic Majesty was supposed, for his own private ends, to concern himself with the Heathen Oracles, Sybils, and Pythonesses, I may, surely, under their respectable authority, make him have occasional recourse to another of the same family, without the least degradation. Besides, I had not one of the Rabbinical Writers within my reach, while I was writing this Poem, to give me the name of Satan's Gentleman Usher: so that, to save myself trouble, which I at all times hate and detest, I borrowed an acquaintance from the Grecian Poets.—Again, if my Critic will but consider of whom the troop consisted which received safe conduct from this winged guide, he must esteem Mercury, who is (Heathenly speaking) the presiding Genius of rogues, sharpers, &amp;c. as properly introduced to be their conductor. —And, as an Orthodox Critic must consider all such in the light of Heathens, my application to the Pagan Mythology will not appear so mal apropos as he at first imagined. With lively greetings met them on the way; He was the brisk Sir Clement Cotterell of the day. The winged God thrice wav'd his magic wand! The massive doors acknowledg'd his command; And, to the Claimants wond'ring Eyes, display'd Satan in all his gloomy pomp array'd. High, in his throne, on golden columns rear'd, The venerable King of Hell appear'd. In his right Hand a weighty mace he bore, And on his brow a regal crown he wore; Begirt around with spiral flames, which shed A silver lustre o'er his aged head. Beneath the Throne, arrang'd in order, sat The long establish'd Council of the State. In every hand the flaming torches wave, And cast their splendor through th'imperial cave. High in the vault the fiery Dragons shone, And Monsters, whose dire shape was never known To mortal fantasy,—when, Reason flown, Fear fills the mind with spectres of her own. With flaky flames the distant region glow'd, Whose angry light, in all their horrors, shew'd Those fields of fire where guilty Spirits dwell, And in loud ceaseless shrieks their anguish tell, Nor respit know:—Hope cannot enter there, To calm their sorrows or to soothe despair. With horrid clangor now the clarion sounds; Through the dark dome the jarring thunder bounds. Then rose the King;—and all th'Infernal Croud With threefold reverence to their Monarch bow'd. Throughout the Court the expecting murmur ran, But soon was hush'd;—when Satan thus began. “Thousands of years have pass'd since, first, I fell “Into the deep abyss of flaming Hell; “And many an age since my Almighty Foe “Gave me dominion in these realms below. “Ambition's Slave, from Heaven I was hurl'd “Down to the depths of this Infernal World. “Tho' Heaven was lost, Ambition still possess'd “Its darling Empire in my haughty breast. “My Tribes, with fruitless expectation chear'd, “And Patriot zeal, this gloomy palace rear'd— “Here fix'd my throne,—here formed my awful state, “And to my will resigned their future fate. “But, cloy'd with power, my Ambition's o'er; “The boasted charms of Empire are no more! “Hear then my Children, hear your Sire declare, “Of Hell's dominions He shall be the Heir, “Whose past life bore the most obdurate crimes; “Who gave new vigour to degenerate times; “False to his God, who every Law defy'd, “Thief, Traytor, Hypocrite and Parricide; “Let him who claims these Titles as his own, “Come forward, prove his claim,—and take the crown.” The Monarch ceas'd!—F? foremost stood And wav'd his hand to hush the murmuring crowd. Then graceful bow'd around; but, ere he spoke, Satan again the awful silence broke: “Well-meaning Youth! thy great and noble aim “Deserves remembrance in the rolls of Fame! “But know, for to thyself 'tis yet unknown, “These Characters of Ill thou canst not own. “Within the deep recesses of thy breast “The pregnant seeds of many a virtue rest. “Now baneful passions do their place supply, “And check their progress to maturity. “The feverish ardor of disastrous Game “Burns with a furious, unrelenting flame; “And daily seeks to quench its parching thirst “By deeds esteem'd the noblest and the first “In Hell's black Calendar.—The foul design “To make another's wealth, by treachery, thine; “To charm, with pleasing arts, the artless Heir, “To call thee friend,—then lay th'unerring snare, “Pocket his fleeting gold,—and leave him to despair. “But I, who every distant Age can see, “Whose keen look kens the vast Futurity, “Ill-pleas'd thy alter'd character behold, “No more by hungry Appetites controll'd; “From every hateful vice and passion free, “Lov'd by the Gods above—and lost to Me! “Farewel!—Thy well-meant efforts will be vain! “Cherubs attend to bear thee back again!” In order due, Volpone next appear'd; Loose was his hair, unshaven was his beard: O'er his whole face was spread a yellow hue, Borrow'd, perhaps, from some relenting Jew Not anxious to be paid.—Gold he had none; Th'inverted pocket told that all was gone. But ere he made his claim to Hell's rewards, His right hand wav'd aloft the fatal Cards. Then, smiling, thus he spoke;—“All-gracious power! “Who from my natal to the present hour, “Didst o'er my life, with fostering care, preside, “My Friend, my Guardian, and my faithful Guide! “How weak the Task my Actions to review! “You know them all, dread Sir, they sprung from You, “And now, I trust, 'tis You alone suggest “The great, determined purpose of my breast, “To try my chance, at this important hour, “And stake my Soul against your sov'reign power— “Who wins have both.”—“Thy soul's already mine,” Satan replied:—“and I this day assign “Thy earthly duty.—Hence, begone, to bait, “With mastiff zeal,—a Minister of State.” “Poor C? dismiss'd, next comes a noble Peer, Grooms, Pimps, and Link-boys, give the triple cheer.” His right hand bore a Horse-shoe and a Bit; His left, a Book by Angelona writ; To whose fair pages—anxious after fame, His Lordship ventur'd to prefix his name. A Wife complain'd that matrimonial dues Were nightly wasted in the wanton stews; A Friend lamented how he was beguil'd, And mourn'd a ruin'd and forsaken Child; While two attendant Parsons boldly swore, They never wanted—but he paid the Whore: Then loud proclaim'd his knowledge in the wiles Of drabby Drury and of low St. Giles. E'en Saint-like Godby blasts her eyes, and swears, P?'s the most abandon'd of his Peers This noble person, verging to that time of life when he may say of the Brothels, “I myself have no pleasure in them,” is fond of introducing Gentlemen of the Black Cloth and Character into these places, where he enjoys the contemplation of their pleasures, and pays for them. Mrs. Godby's piety suffers very much upon these occasions, and can only be equalled by his L?'s refinement, which is so universally known, that I expect every day to hear of its being sung in a proverb. It is not impossible that the scene of the two M?ly?ts, Father and Son, may be acted over again, and again, when a certain young Nobleman returns from his travels. Godby's Nocturnals, p. 116. N. B. The manuscript from which this last note is taken, will make its appearance in due time, and unfold some transactions which the world little thinks of.. His Vouchers done, with simper on his cheek He silent stood;—for P? cannot speak; When the sage Council, with one voice declare— “Rough-riders would disgrace a regal Chair.” Without one Virtue that can grace a name; Without one Vice that e'er exalts to Fame; The despicable B? next appears, His bosom panting with its usual fears: He strives in vain,—and fruitless proves the art, To hide, with vacant smile, the treacherous heart. The faithful Harry This young Nobleman's character is, in every respect, a striking contrast to his ?; but the following Anecdote will give a very strong explanation of my idea concerning him.—When Mr. C? F? proposed him to be elected into one of the fashionable clubs, he was almost universally black-balled. Mr. F?, who at that time had great interest there, was much surprised that his friend should be thus rejected. But as he concluded, and not without reason, that the universal disgust in which the family of his Friend was held had prevented his success, he proposed him again, with a declaration, on his honour, that Mr. C? had not one quality in common with any of his family. The event justified Mr. F?'s penetration, on the second Ballot not a single black-ball appeared against his friend.— This Anecdote has been asserted to me as fact: but be that as it may, the principle of it is founded in truth, and serves the purpose of doing justice to a most amiable Character, whose great merit the Author of these pages, who sincerely loves him, is glad to attest. stands not by his side, His learned Counsel, and his constant guide; Who for an hard earn'd, narrow competence, Supplies his tongue with words, his head with sense It is not uncommon for an avaricious Father to saddle a younger Brother for a maintenance on the elder, especially if he has a place. And if the latter should possess an hereditary baseness, he will carry on the spirit of conditionalizing, and insist that the former shall, in return, give him the use of his understanding. It too often happens that elder brothers want spirit and understanding, and that younger ones who have both in an eminent degree, stand in need of a provision. It is hard that Worth and Genius should be so situated! but this is among the sore evils under the Sun!. At length, recovered from his huge affright, He, stammering, reads the Speech he did not write: “Curst with hereditary love of pelf, “I hate all human beings but myself; “Cross and perplex my wife, because she prov'd, “Poor girl!—not rich enough to be belov'd. “But all return my hate:—where'er I go, “My coward eye beholds a ready foe. “And tho' to Earth's extremes my feet I bend, “These arms would ne'er embrace a real friend. “When my breast throbs with unrelenting grief, “No friendly Spirits bring the kind relief. “If I sink down beneath oppressing pain, “Surrounding foes rejoice as I complain. “I'm scoff'd by those, who from my hand have prov'd “That kindness which would make another lov'd; “Men, who to other Patrons bend their knee, “Are proud of their Ingratitude to me. “Thus, without Friends on earth, I humbly sue “To find, my gracious Liege, a Friend in you. “Hated by all,—I'm fit to be allied “To your Imperial State!”—The King replied: “If vacant smiles and hypocritic air “Could form pretensions to this sov'reign Chair; “If my pale Crown by meanness could be won, “Who'd have so fair a claim as H?'s Son? “But Meanness is a Vice which Devils disdain! “Should'st thou attempt, base Mortal, here to reign, “To wield the Sceptre,—and to wear my Crown; “The infernal Host would rise to cast thee down, “With furious zeal, where outcast Spirits lie, “In the dark dens of gnashing Infamy. “Such minds as thine,—Observe the truth I tell! “Find neither Friends on Earth,—nor Friends in Hell. Appall'd the hapless Lordling sneak'd away, And Harpies hiss'd him to the realms of Day Several of my friends who were kind enough to approve, and, indeed, enforce the publication of this little Work, seemed to think that I had frustrated my intention of marking the insignificance of this Character, by giving so many lines to the delineation of it. But as the bold strokes are more easily imitated than the finer pencillings of nature, those colourless bad qualities which have not sufficient strength or spirit to rise into daring, manly vice, require a great length of description to impress them properly on the attention of the Reader. Indeed, it is my serious opinion, that this man's life would be a profitable lesson to the world, to prove, that meanness of spirit, though unaccompanied by any bold, open violations of virtue, will ever be more contemptible, obnoxious, and distressing, than any of those public vices which are seldom wholly unconnected with some sort of principle, and often originate from the same source with many virtues. The ebullitions of youth, the spur of necessity, the prevalence of example may hurry to enormities. In these cases, however, the cause is not always difficult to be removed, and frequently removes itself. The effects will then cease, and honour and virtue return. But a mean spirit, as in this example, is a low, sneaking, base, fixed propensity to what is bad, which it loves; and yet is compelled by its fears to assume the semblance of good, which it hates. It is wholly incorrigible, and attends the Character it has once possessed through every degree of station and of life; and is very seldom or never known to rise into momentary courage or spirit; unless suicide, to which it has sometimes applied for a dismission from universal contempt may be considered as examples of them. But this subject, which I have already extended beyond the limits of a note, shall be considered in a separate publication, illustrated and proved by anecdotes of the Character before me when he was at School, the University, in France, Ireland, Warwickshire, and London; as a School-boy, a Collegian, a Traveller, a Secretary, a Militia-commander, a Husband, and so on to the present times,—with collateral relations.. The murmurs hush'd,—the Herald straight proclaim'd S?l?n the witty next in order nam'd But he was gone to hear the dismal yells Of tortur'd Ghosts and suffering Criminals. Tho' summon'd thrice, he chose not to return, Charm'd to behold the crackling Culprits burn. With George, all know Ambition must give place, When there's an Execution in the case. I would not be guilty of injustice to any Character. George does not want humanity! nay he has an uncommon portion of this virtue: it extends even to the gallows; and is well known to have bedewed his cheeks with tears at the lamentable fate of that pious personage, commonly called, Sixteen-String Jack. And I may venture to assert, that he never saw a man hang'd in his life, but when the sport was over, he would have been really happy to have restored him to life. It requires a kind of knowledge which every body does not possess, to reconcile the apparent contradictions in the human character. However, I shall not, at present enter further upon the subject than to observe, that there are certain propensities in the mind, which, being long indulged, become irresistible, and stand between Men and their best interests. All the World knows that Mr. S? is attached to gaming, and that when he games, he wishes to win. And there are many will tell you, that this love of play, when it has taken root, becomes the leading, if not the sole, propensity of the human breast. But in the Character before me, there is an evident example of two leading propensities in the same mind, which, upon certain occasions, form a spirit of accommodation, and blend with each other. This very Gentleman, though he had made a very considerable bet that he should not be at a certain execution, was, notwithstanding, discovered to be actually present at the spectacle, dressed like an old woman, in a joseph and bonnet, and seated on horseback, &amp;c. &amp;c. This is a twofold irresistible propensity! Nevertheless, George is a man of humanity.. Then in Succession came a Peer of words, Well known—and honour'd in the House of Lords, Whose Eloquence all Parallel defies! So Sandwich says, and Sandwich never lies. No doubt, the partial Earl delights to see, In this young Lord, his own Epitome. Behind him came, in Regimentals drest, The brazen Gorget hanging on his breast, Th'obsequious Cousin, ready to obey, Whate'er might be the business of the day, With solemn look the conscious Peer began Thus to address the Military Man: “Friend, Cousin, Pimp, or by whatever name “You would be blasted by the trump of Fame, “Approach, and lend me now unusual aid! “You, my brave Soldier, never are afraid, “But when the critic brow of Ladies frown: “With thy assistance, I shall mount the Throne; “And then, to thee, my Coz, these Powers shall bend, “Their Monarch's favourite Counsellor and Friend. “Oft at thy curious vice I've stood amaz'd, “While half stedg'd Subalterns, with wonder, gaz'd. “Of you their sage Lieutenant, Ensigns learn “The weakness of all Virtue to discern! “You fill their brains with Honour and Renown; “And teach them how to live—upon the Town; “To whore, to bully, to blaspheme, to game, “To scorn the boyish blush and honest shame; “And having vers'd them in each common evil, “Lead them to Masques to personate the Devil: “Their grateful Parents will your pains requite, “And fill the Boxes on an Author's Night. “'Twas you unlock'd a pious parent's doors “For Panders, Gamesters, Whores, and Sons of Whores; “And, with uncommon filial duty blest, “Sent her from Hell on earth, in Heaven to rest. “But to my purpose.—In the world above, ‘Bound by resembling characters and love, “We liv'd together, and together stray'd “In Vice's public walk and secret shade. “I found thee apt in every artful wile, “Proud to defame, and eager to beguile. “Whene'er I sigh'd to practise a Deceit, “In thee, my Coz, I found the ready Cheat. “Whene'er I wanted Falsehood to supply “The place of Truth,—you found the ready Lie. “When, to give spirit to some tedious hour “I wish'd to see the Pedant Parson lour, “To make the Simple stare, the Virtuous sigh,— “Your tongue pour'd forth the ready Blasphemy. “But now the scene is chang'd; that farce is o'er, “And e'en your Falsehood will assist no more. “Start not at what I say,—well-temper'd Youth! “Be not alarm'd—you now must speak the truth. “Look not so pale, 'twill suit your nature well; “You ly'd on Earth, and you speak truth in Hell.” This chear'd him much, and made his cheeks to glow, And sav'd his bosom from the threat'ning woe; Which when his Lordship saw, in haughty tone He thus laid claim to the Infernal Throne. “Is there a guilty deed I have not done? “What say you, Coz?” The Captain answer'd, “None!” “Have I not whor'd myself, and made thee whore? “Confirm it with an oath!”—The Captain swore. “Have I not acted every Villain's part? “Have I not broke a Noble Parent's heart? “By deeds of ill have I not seem'd to live?” The Captain gave a bold affirmative. “Do not I daily boast, how I've betrayed “The tender Widow, and the virtuous Maid? “These serious crimes you know, and many more: “Swear, Sir!”—By Egypt's Queen the Captain swore!

But as he spoke, there issued from the croud, ? the base, the cruel, and the proud; And eager cried, “I boast superior claim “To Hell's dark Throne, and ? is my name. “What, shall that stripling Lord contend with me? “I have four Sons as old and bad as he! “Whate'er he swears, I'll swear—he says, I'll say! “And look, All gracious King, my hairs are grey!” Th'astonish'd Demons on each other gaz'd, And Satan's self sat silent and amaz'd; Revolving, in his dubious mind, the state And crimes of each aspiring Candidate; When clanking chains, and doleful shrieks were heard, And injur'd ?'s raving Ghost appear'd See the Letters of Junius, where the able Writer has observed, with his usual spirit and good sense, upon this guilty transaction. Junius felt for human nature, and would not suffer his pen to trace all the particulars of it.

With piteous look he did a Tale unfold, Black with such horrid deeds, that, being told, Hell's craggy vaults with acclamations ring, And joyful shouts of—“? shall be King!” FINIS. THE DIABO-LADY: OR, A MATCH IN HELL. DEDICATED TO THE WORST WOMAN IN HER MAJESTY'S DOMINIONS. ADVERTISEMENT. BY THE EDITORS. When the following Poem was put into our hands, we thought it necessary to write Notes on some of the passages, in order to render the Text more clear and intelligible; for though the Author, in his Preface, takes the liberty of comparing himself to Juvenal, we are of opinion that he more resembles Persius; whose writings are both more severe, and obscure. But in some places, indeed, he has spoken rather too plain; which has induced us to leave out several of his lines, as may be seen by the asterisks, in some of the following pages. O Fairest of Creation, last and best Of all God's works, creature in whom excelled Whatever can to sight or thought be formed, Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! How art thou lost! Milton. DEDICATION TO THE WORST WOMAN IN HER MAJESTY's DOMINIONS. Nec tibi regnandi veniat tam dira cupido; Quamvis Elysios miretur Græcia campos, Nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem. Virg. Georg. I. ? now seated on the Infernal Throne, See The Diaboliad, last line. Thought it not good the Devil should be alone; And so resolved to marry, if a Wife, Fit Consort, could be found, to match his life. “Shall I, said he, who ne'er obey'd a God, “Observe his precepts in my own abode; “Restrain my acts within the Christian scope, “And whore in celibacy, like the Pope? “What tho' I'm head of that Hierarchal Scheme, “Which deems it sin in Priest to quench their flame “In Marriage rites; yet Modern Records tell, “Tho' made in Heaven, they are confirm'd in Hell. “Since such the present state of Wedlock, I, “As Priest and Devil, will the adventure try. “Besides the Pagan system is my Creed, “And in that antient ritual all may read, “That Pluto our great Prototype, had wed “A mortal female to his throne and bed.” The Poet may possibly be reprehended here, by some Critics or Divines, for the confusion of theology that may be objected to this passage. But as the good old proverb says, that Example is better than precept, we shall refer his defence, first, to Ariosto, or Tasso, I forget which, for I am but a poor scholar in the bastard Latin Authors, where the Heathen mythology and the Christian system are mixed together in the same scene; and, next, to Rubens, who in his Luxemburgh Gallery has made Hymen and St. Denis (I think it is) jointly preside at the marriage of Henry IV. He said; then sent his Imps thro' Earth to rove, And chuse a Paramour for Satan's love The ready Ministers of Hell's commands Obedient fly, and take their several stands At Court, Cornely's, and the Coterie; Where Vice, more vicious by effrontery, Fearless, unblushing, braves the eternal laws Of God and Man, to aid the Devil's cause. From these resorts the Imps of Satan chose So hopeful a Seraglio, that 'twould pose The Devil himself to judge the equal claims To Hell's Sultanaship, between such Dames; Who eager all to obtain Infernal sway, In order thus prefer their several plea. First appeared, and to conviction swore, Her smallest crime was that of being Whore; Adultery she added to her plan, Defying equally both God and Man; In forgery and perjury owned such art, She palmed the Gold, while others paid the smart: And lest her just pretences should be vain, The Adelphi P? Sir T? F? too might have sufficiently supported the same evidence; but, by his not being mentioned in this cause, 'tis to be supposed that his avocations in 'Change-Alley had prevented his appearance yet in Court. vouch the tragic scene. Satan with pleasure heard the shocking tale, But inward griev'd such merits there should fail; “The Vice defeats itself,” replied the Devil, “That makes examples to deter from evil.” Next ? forward came, as frail as fair, And urged her suit with confidential air: “Tho' nobly born,” she cried, “and high in life, “A spotless Maiden, and an honoured Wife, “Yet scorning these, I spurned such humble fame, “And boldly sacrificed a Matron's name: “My first amour was with a Youth of Blood; Lest the equivocation of Titles might lead our readers to mistake the person, we think it proper to acquaint them that this Galant was not the hero of C?, but the one who going to bed by himself, was surprized, when he awoke, at finding himself by himself quite alone. See certain Love-Letters upon record. “But here I would not have it understood, “That 'twas Ambition made me aim so high, “No—'twas to aggrandize my infamy; “I chose, to shew all sense of virtue lost, “A Swain who nought but pedigree could boast: “Ask treach'rous D?, if you doubt my word, “Who first abetted, then approved One of the senses of this verb is, in a legal sense, to accuse, to inform against, or convict; from whence the Noun Approver.

This gave advantage to a rival Quean To take her place, and prior audience gain. ? now pressed before, and claimed desert, For having broke a too fond husband's heart; Yet to the joys of marriage-rites still true, Ere one was dead, she had engaged with two: The first she jilted, being thought too tame, Preferred the Bully of her ticklish fame, And like Quiteria in Cervantes' Tale, The bleeding Basil wed, Camacho And his railing has had good effect, we hear, as the Don has got ten thousand pieces, and a good riddance into the bargain, for a release of contract.

In our Second Edition perhaps we may be able to explain this matter further. would play the Devil with me.” Then next moved forward, waddling on her stumps, A weight to put poor Atlas to his trumps; A Dame that late had puzzled heraldry To say what Alias it should stile her by; Who, had she been but born in days of yore, Would have given Hercules one labour more; For sure no mortal Might for her was able, But his who cleansed the foul Augean Stable.

Not brooking long in amorous flames to burn, She whored or wedded, as it served her turn; She married and unmarried as she pleased, While Lords The House of Lords. and Doctors Commons stood amaz'd! But now grown wiser, she resolv'd to fix Her seat of empire on the banks of Styx; But first enquired, “Are any here who knew “A Devil on earth, whom Men call Le Boiteux? Our Aristophanes, or Devil upon Two Sticks, with whom this Lady held a sort of Mountebank Correspondence, upon the occasion of a Piece of his then coming out, in which some part of her private history of public notoriety, was to be exhibited on the stage. “For vengeance on him, even to Hell's-gates The Author we suppose, meant here to allude to one of her Letters upon the above occasion; but he is mistaken in the passage; the Lady did not promise to carry her complaisance so far. As well as we can recollect, she only mentioned that she would attend him to Tyburn, and then leave him to shift for himself, and go to the Devil his own way. I come; “And know, my Liege, I'm just arrived from Rome: She had lately a villa near that City, and lived in great intimacy with the Pope. “On earth he made my Hell; and have not I, “As Satan's Queen, This expression was rather premature—She was but presumptive Consort. But, perhaps, she thought she might do in Hell as she had done on Earth, and marry whom she pleased, right or wrong. a right to make him fry? “What music to my ears, to hear him yell, “And make his Trip to Calais, This Piece was afterwards represented; but whether through fear, favour, or fee, was so garbled, as soon to sink into oblivion. one to Hell! “Above he 'scaped my utmost spite and power, “Grant me revenge, I ask no other Dower! “And rest my Suit for justice, on this hope, “That I am recommended by the Pope.” These two Potentates have ever been in strict confederacy together; and his infallible Holiness has sent more souls to Satan's empire, by his pardons, absolutions and indulgences, than ever were dispatched thither from the Scaffold or the Gallows. Who saw and heard her pleading, must confess, Sh'had Falstaff's flesh, and wit, and wickedness; Tho' some there were who thought her wanton plight Resembled more Doll Tear-Sheet, than the Knight. Yet Satan cried, “Thy claim I must deny, “For want of one Vice more, Hypocrisy; This was the answer of the late Lord Chesterfield, to a profligate Parson who was recommended to him as a Chaplain, once, when he was going Ambassador to The States. There were scandalous persons in those times, it seems, as well as in the present ones. “Your barefaced Sinners are not worth my notice, “Demure pretending Saints, hoc est in votis. This is a Sentence from Horace, but falsely quoted.—The Verb Substantive Sum is in the preter-imperfect tense there, but turned into the present time here. This is one of the vices of verse, which, like the tyranny of Procrustes, lengthens or shortens the members, according as they suit its own measure. But possibly our Author, who is an adept in metaphysics, may reply, that there is no distinction of times or tenses, in the Region of Spirits—the past, the present, and the future being all the instant now, among immortal beings. “Then back return, re-wed your former Peer, “And taste an Hell on earth, ere you come here.” The Court was now disturbed. A jovial troop Of female libertines appeared en groupe; O?, B?, E?, B?, H?, T?, and a Hundred more; Which noisy Amazons made such a riot, That Satan thought 't had been a Polish Diet. “Zounds!” quoth he, in a rage, “whence this abuse? “Call up my guards—What! is all Hell broke loose?” The deafened Cryer thrice proclaimed, O Yes! And Imps and Implings We have looked for this diminutive, of a diminutive, in Johnson's Dictionary, in vain.—We are, therefore, at a loss for sufficient authority to support the word, except we may suppose it an allusion to the vulgar expression, which is sometimes applied to a demure Sinner, that he is as innocent as a Devil of Two Years old. gave a general hiss. Silence at last obtained, each strove to shew Her several right to rule the roast below; 'Till Satan tired with prate, thus made reply; “Your claims so like, and equal are, that I “Can see no choice, except Polygamy: “But when my future Queen takes state upon her, “Ye shall be all preferred to—Maids of Honour.” Here the Devil seems to have been a little out, in the point of Etiquette; for as this illustrious groupe are all Matrons, he could only appoint them as Ladies of the Bed Chamber. The scene now shifted, on the stage appears The Sock and Buskin Heroines, linked in pairs; B? and Y? first trail the purple train Next A? and B? intervene, 'Twixt Y? and B?, who close the Scene. Their Plea was modest, which is something rare, In any Modern male or female Player; Our Author's Sarcasm here is, in general, too true; for we know but few exceptions to the remark. For, not presuming on their own demerits, Their puny Vices, in this land of spirits, They only claim'd, that having acted Queens On Covent Garden and old Drury's scenes, And being Shadows in the mimic show, Their rank they challenged in the Shades below; And thought themselves intitled to obtain An equal dignity in Pluto's reign. A poetical licence again! See our former Note, upon a similar passage, in p. 2. But probably the Author meant to be critical, in this place, by making a distinction here between the imaginary Tartarus of the Pagan Creed, and the real Hell of the Christian belief. In the first, Souls were but Shadows, which was too metaphysical a notion to sway the multitude. But the latter doctrine tells us, that we shall pick up our Crumbs again at the day of judgment, in order to receive corporal punishment. This is sensible, substantial, and edifying. Satan, who has wit and humour, if he'd shew it, For who but him made Rochester a Poet? Or who the Author of the Henriade M. Voltaire. Inspired to write the filthy Pucellade? La Pucelle d' Orleans, or, the Maid of Orleans. Or instigated the Diabolade? The Diabolade, for The Diaboliad. The first should have been the Title, by all rules of Derivation. 'Tis a Substantive, and the latter is an Adjective. Diaboliadus, da, dum. Besides the justness of the alteration in the Word, our Author might have had a further interest in it, also, as his own Title of Diabo-Lady derives more fairly from one word than the other. Thus, with a sly, Sardonic smile replied: “Your claim, fair Puppets, must be here denied; “For hear a truth, a truth for once I'll tell: “Whate'er your state, while on earth ye dwell, “Your Green-room Dolls are Kitchen Maids in Hell.” This is meant in Opposition to Maids of Honour above-mentioned; as he did not think their station or character in life, entitled them to any higher office in the Household of the Pandemonium. At length with dimpling cheek, and leering eye, Long noted in the rolls of Infamy, ? stept forth and claim'd the vacant crown, For every crime that bears in Hell renown. Her argument she thus maintained with force, Recounting deeds of blame from bad to worse: “Tho' blest with beauty, rank and powers to engage, “To charm in Youth, and win Time-honour'd An Epithet borrowed from Shakespeare, in Richard II. age, “Yet still ambitious of a nobler aim, “I squandered beauty, dignity, and fame, “To earn thy notice, thy loved Empire own, “And, jure infernali, share thy throne— “False to my husband's bed, I scorned to rove “Thro' common guilt, but chose incestuous love; “I drove him to distraction and despair, “And then removed a Sister and her heir; “To make Succession sure, and seal the deed, “Which helped my spurious issue to succeed This is an old Story; and we confess that we agree in the same Charity with the good old Woman, who, hearing of the Passion, one Sunday at Church, said, that, as it was so long ago, she hoped in the Lord that it was not true. “Of favours profligate and nothing nice, “In many another mean ignoble vice; “I gamboled, and I gambled deep at play, “And raised finances in less legal way; “I sweated gold, Another obsolete Story. and practised every cheat, “Which, known to thee, I need not here repeat. “My deeds with thine compared, in every art, “Prove me in all—thy worthy counterpart: “In fine, to crown my merits, you shall find “I'm the reverse of her you left behind: “Nay more, to shew me fit to share thy sway, “Behold, my Liege, my locks, like thine, are grey.

See page 77, Line 10. The astonish'd Court sat silent all the while, Satan grinned horribly a ghastly smile; Grinned horribly, &amp;c. Milton. Then cried, “Resolved—I swear by Sacred Styx, “On thy alliance my firm choice I fix.” The nuptial torches yield a brimstone flame, And Heralds are commanded to proclaim, With Ætna's thunders, and infernal Yell, “? is crowned unrivalled Queen of Hell!” FINIS.</field>
