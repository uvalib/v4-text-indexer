      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF NATURE. âPOESY LIVES IN EVERYTHING.â Poesy lives in everything, Though only poets find Her hidden treasures, or can bring These treasures to mankind. She lives with Nature evermore Alike on land and sea; Where breakers roar far, far from shore, And on the quiet lea; Where yonder mountain's soaring peak Scarce fails to touch the sky; In yonder vale where, fair and sleek, The drowsy cattle lie; In yonder cot where seldom come The cares of human strife; In yonder city never dumb With sounds of human life; Where yonder babbling brooklets haste, Begirt with mossy strands; And even where Greed makes many a waste In many lovely lands; 'Mid friends and kindred everywhere; In talks with those we love; And when, with humble heart, we dare To think of things above; A part of every impulse here, Of every joy and pain; She hallows all, is ever near, To calm, to cheer again. Yes; Poesy's white hands can mould From much of earth, pure leaven; And who shall say she will not hold A noble place in Heaven! DESPONDENCY: A MOOD. Often a word, a look, a jest, Piercing the veil its depths concealing, Awakens joy within my breast I ne'er again had dreamed of feeling. To hear the prattle of a child Amid the summer daisies playing, To gaze on Nature, stern and wild, Or when her summer winds are straying; To hear the tones of some loved air Familiar in Life's morn of gladness,â Small things, yet they dispel my care,â Small things, yet how they heal my sadness! But, ah, their influence dies away, Leaving life drear as when it found me, Nay, yet more drear, for that one ray Of sunshine it has shed around me. âNO SUN EVER ROSE WITHOUT SETTING.â No sun ever rose without setting, For surely there cometh the night; No night ever stayed, but begetting The dawn, it departed in light. No joy ever came without bringing A shadow to tell us of grief; To sorrow there ever is clinging A something to render relief. And therefore in life there remaineth For joy and for sorrow a place, And naught on the earth but containeth A power its effects to efface. Gird on then your armour of gladness To combat despairing with scorn, And live through your night-time of sadness In hope of the glories of morn. A SONG OF EARLY SUMMER. Sweet is the time when tender leaves Burst forth in all their perfect grace, When swallows twitter from the eaves, And Spring to Summer yields her place; When red and white the chestnut shows, When fragrance from the hawthorn spreads, When fair the blue wistaria blows, And iris lilies lift their heads. Yet soon the chestnut petals fade, Wistaria blooms droop one by one, Soon sigh the leaves for welcome shade, Then fall with dews at set of sun. Not so the spring-time of the heart, That knows nor change nor swift decay, The spring-time of our nobler part Shall never fade or pass away. THE HEART'S SUMMER. Sweet is the noon of a summer day When, through the woodlands coming, The village sounds seem far away And drowsy bees are humming. Sweet are the hours of a summer night When kindly dews are falling, And thoughts that come with the fading light Are soothing, or enthralling. Sweet are the tones of a friendly voice When all seems gone but sorrow, Bidding the heart once more rejoice, For peace may come to-morrow. Sweet is the sound of the world's applause When fame at last hath found us, And (wage for toil in a righteous cause) Flings victory's wreath around us. But sweeter far is a heart at rest, A heart unsoured by sadnessâ Which throbs within a blissful breast With a God-imparted gladness. IN ELLINGTON COPSE. How lovely are these woodland ways Clad in their summer dress, Where come not din and smoke to mar Their evening loveliness; Where wild-rose and convolvulus Are wov'n in every hedge, And buttercups and foxgloves glow By this clear brooklet's edge; Where breezes waft their balmiest scents Adown the silent wood, And scarce a songster sings to break The hush of solitude; Where shadows creep across my path And softly dies the dayâ And Summer's beauty holds the world Within her gracious sway. This evening every wild-flower here More deeply stirs my heart Than alien flowers or prodigies Of man's botanic art; This sweet-brier bough, that meekly sends Its perfume on the air, I would not give for any flower The gardener deems most fair; I leave the rich their bowers of art Wreathed with the rarest flowers, Enough for me these woodland ways In Summer's twilight hours. THE LAME BOY IN THE WOODS. Each season hath its sadness, but for me Summer hath most of all. I know not why, But though its sylvan beauty soothes my soul And brings sweet reveriesâthough the happy birds, Discoursing music, stir my mind with dreams, With melodies, with thoughts of deep delight; Yet still there lurks within the Summer's heart Or in mine own, a painâa deep, wild painâ Which, even amid still Autumn's ravages I never feel, nor yet in Winter's storms. Is it, I ask, that Summer's voiceless spellâ Her loveliness of copse and lea and flower Is all too soon dissolvedâthat blossoms fade When Summer's glory dies? Ah, no; ah, no! It is that Summer's mocking gladness lends To loss a sharper sting when I recall The joy of buoyant health and tireless limbs Which others feelâalas! through all my life A joy that knows not me. THE UNFULFILLED IDEAL. When youthful Summer decks the sward With flowers on plain and hill, And Nature wins her meet reward For working Winter's will, Even then Life's music lacks a chord: Something wanted still! In Autumn, when each searing leaf With gentle sorrow fraught, And every garnered golden sheaf Yield fruit for mingled thought:â We feel a voidâthere comes a griefâ Something vaguely sought! When Winter lays an icy hand Where Spring had kissed the ground, And stiff and stark is all the land Where Summer erst was crowned:â We feel but do not understand: Something still unfound! When Spring returns with radiant grace To fill the earth with song, And gladness smiles in every place, And love and life are strong, Still comes the want we cannot trace: Something wanted long! âTHE AUTUMN IS DYING.â The autumn is dying, And leaves that are still, Grief's tokens, are lying On plain and on hill; My garden of pleasure Lies withered and bare, Oh, the pitiless measure Of ruin wrought there! In a hedgerow wind-shaken To wildest unrest, Forlorn and forsaken I see a bird's nest, Its soft down decaying, Its fledglings all flown, Naught save the shell staying Deserted and lone. Then the thought rises, cleaving The depths of my mind, Soon we too shall be leaving Our loved homes behind, Soon the grave will enclose usâ Life's pilgrimage o'erâ âAnd the place that now knows us Shall know us no more.â ASPIRATIONS. O for the poet's voice and songâ Piercing, yet sweet and clear, Rich as the cushat's note, yet strong To reach the great world's ear! O for the visions that abide Within the poet's mind, The thoughts which through his bosom glide Leaving strange joy behind! O for the fruitâimmortal fruit Soiled by no earthly leav'n, Not fame alone, nor vain repute, But something caught from heav'nâ Assurance that my strain has cheered One soul, if only one, And shed on the dark path it feared A passing glimpse of sun! DECEMBER DAISIES AND DECEMBER DAYS. Ah, how the sight of these untimely flowers Brings dear remembrances of summer hours, When the full heart in buoyant mood was filled With happinessâwhen the swift moments thrilled The soul with subtle thoughts no words express. Kind halcyon moments! How they soothe and bless And beautify my sordid life. And here, When this December day is stir-less, clear At its brief twilightâwhen there shines afar From out a cloudless heav'n yon evening starâ When southern breezes blow, nor storm nor rain Disturb,âI dream 'tis summer come again. SOLITUDE. Amid the throng Which, restless, moves along With hurrying footsteps o'er the earth But few their noblest thoughts have known, Seldom save when alone Come thoughts of worth. It needs the balm Of soul-restoring calm To purge the mind of Life's alloy; Thus yielding back Man's highest power, His blessÃ¨d pristine dower Of peace and joy. And thus do men With new and eager ken Taste those rich joys that only live In solitudeâjoys which uplift Their souls to truthâbest gift That Life can give. WIND FANCIES. Murmuring winds vague fancies carry To the heart while sweeping by, And the fancies often tarry Though the winds that brought them die. Now the fancies are of gladness, Life itself seems one delight; Now the fancies are of sadness, Life itself seems dark as night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF CONSOLATION AND OF RELIGION. JOY AND SORROW. âThey soon forgat His works.ââPsalm cvi. v. 13. As raindrops falling on a lake Leave scarce a ripple's trace behind, Our blessings for an instant break The torpor of the thankless mind. Like letters graven on the steel, Our trials scourge us, and remain; And, cleaving to us, make us feel The lasting anguish of their pain. And in our strait we come to Thee, We bring Thee then our earnest prayer: âGrant, Lord,â we cry, âthat we may be More mindful of Thy loving care.â We pray that all our troubles here May help to give the needed strength To keep our watch-fires burning clear Till Life's last halt we reach at length. BY-AND-BY. Ofttimes our path seems smooth, and bright as May, And full of joyance still from day to day; Yet by-and-by Comes Grief to cast chill shadows on the way. Soon fair Content, our sun, is lost to sight; Now shrouded is the track in fearsome night; Yet by-and-by Kind Time will bring once more the welcome light. Ever we journey on; through weal, through woe; Though rough the path even there the wild-flowers grow, And by-and-by Gleam God's high bastions, afar, aglow. A SONG OF COMFORT. Not always have we sorrow, there are seasons When buoyant joy dispels all dreams of ruthâ Times when our thoughts of sorrow seem but treasons To king-like Truth. Not always are we vext by cares and troubles,â Often the griefs of life appear no moreâ Vanished, as on a lake the rain-drop bubbles, When showers are o'er. Not always feel we that our hopes are blighted; A glad fruition will they often gain, When we perceive the good are aye requited Who conquer pain. Not always should we grieve, each tribulation Is sent to purifyâto raise the soul, To fit it for its glorious destinationâ A heavenly goal. BORROWED LIGHT. 'Tis night; and darkness as a pall Enwraps the sable scene, Nor doth one glimmering ray recall Where sunshine late hath been. Until the moon 'neath yonder cloud Shall bring a borrowed light, And, piercing through the landscape's shroud, Dispel the gloom of night. So 'tis in life; 'mid deepest woe, Oft drawing nigh despair, God-borrowed beams alone still show That joy abideth there. THE TRUEST TREASURE. Life may bring us bitter sorrow When our hearts refuse submission, When we long for a to-morrow Bringing balm as Hope's fruition. Love may bring us bitter sadness When we know our love can never Give anew the sense of gladness That we thought it would for ever. Joy may bring us bitter trouble: Faith may die in voiceless anguish; Hope may seem an empty bubble When bereft of hope we languish. Worldly peace may bring us only, In our heart of hearts, disquiet; Leaving usâwill leave us lonely Battling in the world's rude riot. Trust in man may bring delusion; Often, often hath it perished, And we feel, in dim confusion, 'Twas a phantom that we cherished. Trust in God in fullest measure Holds of earthly change no leaven, And it is the truest treasure, For it makes of earth a heaven. A MEMORY AND A PRESENCE. When clasping in mine own the hand Of him I loved the best, Whose converse cheered, as sight of land Cheers mariners distressed, How once I loved the darkening hour Of Summer's happy day, As gently from each leaf and flower The daylight passed away. For he had learnt to bear his part In Earth's unending strife, To labour with unflinching heart Amid the ills of lifeâ To feel adversity and pain, Hopes blighted, bitter wrong, And yet, ere long, to find again God's peace which makes men strong. So would he talk of bygone years In that hush'd eventide, Of former hopes, delights, and fears, Of early friends who died, And wisely would my future trace, Then leaving things of Time, In raptured tones, with upturned face, Would speak of themes sublime. He had that wordless eloquence, That strange, that wondrous power, Which sways the soul with force intense In calm of such an hour; And walking where the shadows steal Across the garden here, Alone with memory still I feel His spirit ever near. THE BALANCE OF LIFE. 'Tis false to say the world, though sad, Hath no redeeming feature, 'Tis false to say the world, though glad, Can hold no hopeless creature. The darkest life has oft a ray Of sunshine on the morrow, The brightest life has many a day Whose hours are filled with sorrow. No life with ceaseless grief is fraught, None with all bliss and beauty, By varied teaching are we taught The way to walk in duty. If happy be our earthly lot, And free from Sorrow's burden, Greater the need to linger not;â Our work shall have its guerdon: Yet richer guerdon comes to those Whom heav'n hath not exempted From pain, who quell the self-same foes Although more sorely tempted. Each grief that sweeps across the heart, If sinless be its sadness, In Life's long lesson bears a part And yields us future gladness. MIRACLES. Christ's wondrous miracles were signs indeed Of wondrous power; yet every miracle Of His had moral purpose, and was wrought To show this moral purpose: and perchance Thus is it that no longer we possess The power to do such deeds. Had you or I Such gifts, we still should heal unceasingly, Nor judge of the effects were cures but made. Where then would be God's discipline of pain? Where His just government of all His world? Where then would be His discipline of sorrow? TO CHRISTINA ROSSETTI. Great as a Poet, greater as a Woman. (Died December 29th, 1894.) I marvel not that God hath called away Thy peerless soul to where His saints abide; Rather I praise Him that He bade thee stay On earth so longâto be a heavenward guide. GOD'S PEACE. âThe peace of God which passeth all understanding.â âPhil. iv. 7. How oft amid the griefs of lifeâ Perplexed, misjudged, distressedâ O God, I waver in the strife, And long and cry for rest. How oft I feelâso great my need, My courage so outwornâ As though my griefs were now indeed Greater than could be borne. Yet oft will come in times like theseâ Come like a gracious balmâ A sense of peace, of joy, of ease, A sense of heaven's own calm. Ah! then my heart would fain express What I have felt beforeâ 'Tis not I feel my griefs are lessâ I feel Thy love is more. And some are here, O God, to-day, Here with their voiceless grief, O give the aid for which they pray, O give such sweet relief, O give Thy peace, Thy calm, Thy joys, Here as they humbly bowâ Such gifts nor Time nor Change destroys, Give them, and give them now. HOLY QUIETUDE. Spirit of holy quietude, For thee my soul is sighingâ For thee in many a mournful mood My soul is blindly cryingâ But still a voice comes softly clear, âThat spirit seldom cometh here.â Spirit of holy quietude, While, weary, I am breasting Life's waves, bring with thee all things goodâ Deep peace, and joy, and resting:â Yet still the voiceââNo, never here Doth she thy soul would find appear.â Spirit of holy quietude, Grant me a single tokenâ Show me that Life's long conflict rude By gleams of peace is broken; But the voice whispers in mine ear, âThat spirit never dwelleth here.â Spirit of holy quietude, Mine earthly course is ending, Now let thy peace within me brood, Sin's strongest fetters rending; âIn heaven,â the voice says at my sideâ âIn heaven alone doth she abide.â A SUNRISE IN EARLY SUMMER. I Now lagging black-browed Night at last is gone, And fair and happy Dawn at length is here. How sweet the sights which now I look uponâ The sights of summer beauty growing clear! The meadows yonder and the lawn appear Glittering with dewdropsâdewdrops silvery, white, Touched by the sun's first beams; while far and near Each bird, each flower awakes, and hails the sight Of coming morn: to them like me it brings delight. II To eastward lies a mass of sable cloud Made glorious by the rising sun, who flings His rays athwart its depths. I hear the loud Yet mellow thrush's noteâa blackbird sings With sudden burst of songâa lark up-springs From that wide field of wheat; so more and more Sounds Nature's orchestra of myriad strings. I watch the apple-bloom, while May-buds pour On all the gentle air their matchless, fragrant store. III O, who at sunrise could be aught but gladâ Sunrise, the prototype of perfect day, When we shall wake to bliss, nor weak nor sad, And, feeling swiftly the seraphic ray From God's effulgence, cast the fears away Which still cleave to us, and with rapturous soul Know that black Trouble can no longer stay In His blest presenceâknow the precious goal Where all Earth's grievous wounds are made for ever whole. âLORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.â Luke xi. I. A dark enigma is our life Without Thy guiding ray; Then calm, O Christ, its sordid strife By teaching us to pray. Prayer is Heaven's torch when doubts and fears With darkness cloud our way,â Its holy radiance guides and cheers,â What peace it brings to pray! Oft lies our path through pain and woe While in Earth's night we dwell, Yet prayer is still a light to show That aye Thou leadest well; So when Life's mysteries distress, And Sorrow bars our way, We plead that Thou wouldst make it less By teaching us to pray. A RALLYING SONG. Sometimes trustful, often fearful, In this world of shifting wrong; Sometimes joyful, often tearful, Still be this our rallying songâ Aye, in sadness And in gladness, Nobly act, for God is strong. When, oppressed by deep soul-sorrow, Life beneath the darkest skies Seems so drear that no to-morrow Holds a threat of worse surpriseâ In such sadness As in gladness Nobly act, for God is wise. When our souls are tried, and tempted Some ignoble end to buy, From the coward's bonds exempted, Let us resolutely cryâ Evil sow not, That it grow not, Nobly act, for God is nigh. MORNING THOUGHTS. Sweet-voiced songsters softly singing Tell me of a day begun, Its appointed portion bringing Of the duty to be done. Last day's deeds are gone for ever,â Seems it not most passing strange Their results remain, and never Can be touched by time or change? Like a child, his pebble throwing From the streamlet's sedgy marge, Marking not the ripples growing Though they one by one enlargeâ So, with influence still increasing, Widening o'er Life's mystic sea, Man deals out his actions,âceasing Only with Eternity. Many yesterday, unthinking, Chose the road which leads to night,â While a few, with souls unshrinking, Chose the pathway of the light. Thus I muse with deep emotion Whilst the moments melt awayâ Muse upon the boundless ocean Of the issues of to-day. ON A PRESENT CRISIS IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. Who would have deemed the days would come When Superstition's blighting force In this our land would take its course Unchecked, condoned, no longer dumb? This land where many a Smithfield fire Blazed three short centuries ago, And where âthe Babylonian woeâ Milton denounced with thunderous lyre. Three centuries ago our race Saw God-like Truth, and loved her well; No visitant, she came to dwell With us; and England took her place First of the nations; glorious youth Her dower, and on her queenly brow God's seal of peace. God grant her now Once more a sight of God-like Truth. London, February 26th, 1899. HER BOY JUST DEAD. (A Mother Speaks.) My darling dead! Is all the long endeavour To vanquish Death in vain? These wistful eyes, So Truth-illumed and loving, will they never Check by a look again my futile sighs? And shall I weepâalthough for him the gladness Of this world's many pleasures now is o'er, And I am left with this my load of sadness, Which here on earth is mine for evermore? A cripple's lot were his, had he remaining, Here ta'en his part where grief and care are rifeâ Little of sinless happiness obtaining, Feeling all miseries of earthly life. To shorten that hard period of probation Given to such as he so often hereâ To raise him soon to an immortal station Where comes no thoughtless word, no taunt, no jeerâ The Master, in His mercy, gently made him Fitter among His ransomed ones to beâ And day by day more perfectly arrayed him In His own peerless robe of purity. Then shall I cherish an abiding sorrow For him whom God in goodness calls away? Nay, rather let me muse on that blest morrow Which joins in bliss our severed souls for aye. JOHN CLIFFORD: God's Soldier. [In October, 1908, Fohn Clifford completed his fifty Years' Ministry to One Congregation.] Born of the people, with a scorn of wrong Bequeathed from Puritansâpersistent, strong, Eager to serve God's folk, while more and more In this our London, vast, and grim, and hoar, You skilled yourself in academic lore. Noble and selfless was each thought; each aim Pure as a snow-flake, pure as is the flame From Truth's undying torch that burns to show Ever an upward path, through weal, through woe. Often you walked through many a London streetâ Saw many a man who paused with way-worn feetâ And saw the wrinkled furrows on his brow Proclaim that he was well-nigh agÃ¨d nowâ And this, before stern Time, with ruthless sway, Touching, had turned his sunny locks to grey. You saw how trembling was his nerveless hand, His fingers scarcely under due command; You saw how devious was his tottering tread, How bent, though not with weight of years, his head; You saw how his whole face, his gait, his air Showed sad, though all too common, signs of care. Often you walked through many a London streetâ Saw many a girl who paused with way-worn feet, And dreamt of her a happy rose-lipped child In some far country home where dear ones smiled. Haply you saw her shaping daisy-chains While little sisters help, and for their pains, Receiving, on the sward, as payment meet, The pretty chaplet from her, when complete. And as you gazed upon her saddened face, Where sin, or want, or sorrow you could trace; Alas, alas, how mournful in their birth, Rose dimly, thoughts of these dead days of mirth. Dreams such as these, amid the sounds that jar Our civic music, made you what you areâ The matchless leader who, by pen or word, Against unnumbered odds at last has stirred Our civic Conscience to take up her task Towards her sons and daughters, and to ask For those who toil, more light, more joy, more air, And homes more clean and spacious everywhere. 'Tis only when a lake is calm and clear It well reflects the landscape that is near, And thus men's quiet deeds from day to day With best fidelity their minds display; So when you pass among us, with your look Or hand-shake kindly, or your shrewd rebuke, Or when we see you in some homely hour Of talk, we feel the secret of your power. Great orator in gesture, voice, and word, Whose lofty eloquence none hear unstirred, You roused our people to take earnest heed Unto their children's teaching: there was need. Passing for fifty years âfrom strength to strengthâ Your power for good increases, till at length On every problem that confronts the State, On all the things which make our nation great, To you we look for counsel, for we share Your heritage of hope, of faith, of prayer. True ever is the music of your life, Your soul safe anchored, though near shoals of strife. Wise thought on such as you uplifts the heart; Now lie your years before us, like a chart, Thereon is shown a way whereby each one, Though sore the toil, and scorching be Life's sun, Elated, shall receive God's glad âWell done.â Forward you move with that eternal youth They only know, who drink from wells of Truth, Your warmth enkindles many an arctic soul To more and more self-conquest, more control. God's soldier, 'tis your calling still to fight, Till dawns, with Heav'n's own peace, Heav'n's own calm light. A PLEA FOR FAITH. Life! How mysterious does it seem, how strange Its grief, its happiness, its shame, its sin! How hard its changes are! Can we believe In a great God of kindness infinite Who yet can daily leave His hapless world To beâfor so it seemsâthe home of pain, Pain often useless, often showered on those Who seem to need it least? Can we believe In Perfect Goodness and Omniscient Power Permitting Evil to possess and spoil His fair dominions, and to bring a curseâ An ageless and unceasing curseâupon them? Alas, to our poor minds our futile years Seem but a clueless maze. When happiness Is ours, a hidden canker-worm reveals Its hateful presence, and too soon there comes Something to vex the spirit, or to jar, Something to cloud or check our perfect joy. One man has buoyant health, and feels delight In living merely, yet he finds how hard Is poverty to bear; it oftentimes Hangs round him as a changeless destiny. Too rich is he to rank among the poor, Too poor is he to rank among the rich; Of neither class, he knows the ills of both. Another man has ample wealth, and friends Who love to do him honour, and to give To him the zest in living which such friends Alone can give. Yet look!âalas, 'tis clear Disease's curse is on him, fell disease For which weak human skill affords no cure And scarce alleviation. He is doomed To pass a joyless life despite the joys Surrounding him. Another man we see With riches and with pulse of flawless health. With steadfast, cheerful face he fronts the world, And all seems well; yet could we look within, Some grief we should perceive which saps his life And makes it full of careâa grief that springs Not from his fault; or oftentimes we see Innocent children suffer for the sake Of guilty parents, or a mother's heart Guileless and pure, that bleeds for some loved son Or daughter who, alas, has gone astray. Not seldom in despondency we feel As though the wrong is victor o'er the right, As though our life were but a flake of foam Cast by some cruel sea on some bleak shore, A moment seen, and then for ever lost. And yet, if we deny that God exists As perfect in His goodness as His power, If we deny that Death, God's angel, brings To man a nobler life, what do we gain To compensate us for the hopes we lose? For still we must endure the woes of life, Still must we feel the longings which arise For rest and peace amid our daily toil. These we must still endure, and yet perceive Beyond the grave no gleam of gathering light, Nought save the gloom of nothingness before us. But if we greet kind Faith, and let her hand Lead us through all our years, though at the last We find that hope of happier life is vain (That 'twere so would not change the argument) Faith's guidance will have given a mighty boon To us, in gladdening all our days on earth. So even if we wholly set aside Faith's fervent pleading with the intellectâ A pleading ever present, ever strong, 'Tis wiser far to guide our minds to view The problem still in some such wise as this, 'Tis true amid our earthly life there runs A tangled thread of strange perplexity And much injustice; yet comes by-and-by A nobler state of being, when that which seems Unjust will be explained or set aright. 'Tis best to hold that there exists a God Who made Man's mind with marvellous powers, though He, In His deep wisdom limited the scope Of what He made, wherefore our reason's sphere Of thought is swiftly reached, and so it seems To us so frequently that human life Hath such injustice in its fleeting years; That He decrees that it is well for us In humble trust to tread âThe path of sorrow,â Perchance as discipline for some high scheme Of joy hereafter, or perchance to show To others how the brave can conquer pain; That Life's dark mysteries do but transcend, Not contradict our reason, and when soon Our earthly life shall close, there dawns a life When He endows us with new gifts of mind. Then chief among the pleasures it can give Will be the thrill of joy when first we feel That now we understand those mysteries Which vexed our souls beforeâwhen first we find That many âthemes with which we cannot copeâ Grow clear, and âEarth's worst phrenziesâ are at length Forgotten in the joy of Hope's fruition. TO A WORKER AMONG THE POOR. Courage like yours has still a mighty power To purify the mind from hour to hour, To permeate with thrilling force the soul, To give new confidence, new self-control, To make each faulty faculty so clear That, though you plainly see the danger near, You scorn to dread itâscorn to turn aside, Duty your first, your chief, your only guide. The soldier 'mid the scenes of deadly strife Thinks of his countryâthinks not of his life; And shall we then in these degenerate days Speak of him lightly, cease to give him praise? Yet Glory has for him her ancient charm, Excitement nerves for him his stalwart arm; When bullets whistle in the dread advance, For him there comes the touch of old Romance. War has its use: sometimes it keeps alive Those qualities that make a nation thrive; In certain minds it checks the love of self; It teaches self-control, and scorn of pelf; Once and again it seems to make for good, By teaching patriotism and fortitudeâ That love of country flippant scribes deride As but a foibleâbut a foolish prideâ That love of country which a nation's fame Exalts; whose absence brings a nation's shame. Yet War, alas! not seldom seems to be Only a form of licensed butcheryâ One of the ills that from our passions springâ The warrior's courage but a puny thing. Yes; yours is truer courage, for it comes Not from the fife's shrill note, nor roll of drums, Not from the maddening energy of pain Where Horror, heedless, stalks among the slain, But from that hidden strength which has its birth In some sublimer sphere beyond this earth. That bravery is not yours which men acclaim; That bravery is not yours which gives men fame; Yours is the courage which but few suspect; Yours is the courage which can bear neglect; Yours is the courage which can suffer long, The courage of the man whose soul is strong, Who labours on, still doing silent good, Nor stays his hand for Man's ingratitude. Although you seem to till a thankless soil, Your prayers are never vain, nor vain your toil; Some fruit you yet may have to cheer your heart, In some new epoch you may bear a part; But ev'n if now, through your short span of years Your work be weary, and no fruit appears,â Though, in humility, you look within, Deeming your failure the result of sin,â It is not so; for still our Father knows What each requiresâon each He still bestows The discipline most needed; still He weighs Our work with heavenly scales; our purblind gaze Finds failure often where He knows success. All are His instruments, and so the less His need of one man for the world's great need; Righteous He is, to all He gives their meed Of praise or blame; yet not like us He scansâ We see results, by them we make our plans, And trust or trust not men. Men's character He reads with searching glance that cannot err, And thinks not of results, but values still Patience and faith, and will to do His will. So to His best beloved oft gives He trial, As to His BlessÃ¨d Son, of base denial, And haply most will honour near His throne Some humble follower by the world unknown. Blurred is perspective by our earthly viewâ To God perspective aye is clear and true. Effort like yours ever to do the right Will raise your soul from height to nobler height, And gives at last that guerdon, full, unpriced, The âWell doneâ of your life-long master, Christ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS AND SONNETS CONCERNING SHAKESPEARE. I.âIN PRAISE OF SHAKESPEARE. (Spoken by Mr. William Miles as a prologue to his Shakespearean recitals.) âHe was not of an age, but for all time!â Never was nobler poet-tribute paid Than this of stalwart Jonson to his friendâ To him whose deathless crown of love is wov'n By Nature's royal hand of Nature's flowers. As Shakespeare left this earth his Prospero's wand Waved over England; lo! it hath transformed her! Two thousand years of ever-changing life Wrought less of change in her than fifteen score Since face to face men met the bard in London. All, all is changed! Save love and joy and laughter, ay, and pain And hope and sin and sorrow, yet he speaks With clarion voice as ever, witnessing For truth and right, for tenderness and faith. Not with the arid tones of some harsh preacher Who scolds the while he teaches, but with art Which pictures right, which pictures sin and shame, And points to truth. Here haggard Shylock stands To show the cruel wrong that racial hate Alike brings to the oppressors and oppressed. Cordelia now approaches, tender-eyed, Meek, with kind pity for her father, Lear, A king no longer. Radiant Juliet comes, Her Romeo has tranced her eye, and lo Her being all is changed. For Love is hereâ Sweet, early Love that makes a girl a woman, And makes a youth a man. Sorrow and pain, Alas! are later. But their present bliss Is all-sufficing to the twain, and they Know heaven when clasped in one another's arms. Macbeth and his too zealous wife appear, And pass before our eyes plotting foul crimes. The âbanished Dukeâ and kindly Jacques reveal The greatest of the boons that Life may give Is love of Nature and simplicity. Gay Benedick and mirthful Beatrice Make âMuch Ado,â and linger, laughter-laden. Bold Katherina yields herself at last As conquerered in âThe Taming of the Shrew.â But not till she has railed and railed again At brave Petruchio. See Hamlet pass, Profoundest personage in all the host That Shakespeare makes to live, a lofty soul, The study and the marvel of the world. March 8th, 1907. II.âSHAKESPEARE IN LONDON. (Composed for the Shakespeare Reading Society's Commemoration, 1907, and recited by Mr. Alexander Watson.) Who comes, a man in mind, a boy in age,â Hope's golden music ringing in his ears, To conquer London single-handedâwage Battle with Chanceâbattle with strong compeers? And now, who leaves the conflictâvictory wonâ Who bids farewell to London's glorious strife, To brood by Avon-lilies that have shone Bright in his brain through all that stress of life? As homeward wending towards the little town He leftâhow brief the time!âwithout a name, What are his visions? Does he see the crown With which the world shall crown him? Does the fame Of Shakespeare reach him? Does the skylark sing âBehold our Will come backâthe poet-king!â? III.âSHAKESPEARE AT STRATFORD-ON-AVON. Shakespeare, thy legacy of peerless song Reveals mankind in every age and place, In every joy, in every grief and wrong: 'Tis England's legacy to all our race. Little we know of all thine inner lifeâ Little of all thy swift, thy wondrous yearsâ Years filled with toilârich years whose days were rife With strains that bring us mirth, that bring us tears. Little we know, and yet this much we know, Sense was thy guiding starâsense guided thee To live in this thy Stratford long agoâ To live content in calm simplicity; Greatest of those who wrought with soul aflame At honest daily workâthen found it fame. IV.âPROLOGUE AND INTERSPERSED LINES To a performance of Episodes from the Plays of Shakespeare, illustrative of London life. Given in the Gardens of Lowther Lodge, South Kensington, on June 21 and 22, 1907, by the Members of the Shakespeare Reading Society, in aid of the Funds of the South Kensington District Branch of the League of Mercy. The poem was spoken throughout in the first instance by Mr. Otto Sallmann, and subsequently the eight detached portions were delivered by eight chosen narrators, one from each group of players. Leagued in the angel Mercy's âtwice-blessedâ cause, We bring these scenes before you. Your applause We take not to ourselves, 'tis meant for himâ London's chief bard whose glory grows not dimâ Shakespeare, whom Coleridge called âthe thousand-souled.â 'Tis our delight to-day that we unfold Some treasures;âfreaks of fancy, genius-fraught; Glimpses of wit and pathos he had caught When dreaming in the London of the past, Where gabled fronts of oak long shadows cast, Where rapiers rattled, and where, far and nigh, The varied garb gave pleasure to the eye. To him each showed an inmost self; and there Perchance the Muse first found him, unaware. Now is presented sad Queen Katherine's trial, Her piteous suit to Henry, and denial;â A tale of woman's sorrow long ago, A tale of mingled guile, deceit, and woe. [Here was performed âHenry VIII.,â Act 2, Scene 4 (The Trial of Queen Katharine).] Then comes from bright Messina, far away, Sage Dogberry. And, have we not to-day Some of his tribe still with us? Night by night Do they not guard usâmake our slumbers light? [Here was performed âMuch Ado About Nothing,â Act 3, Scene 3 (The Watch Scene).] And soon shall you behold the fall of pride As shown by stately Wolsey, placed beside Anne Boleyn's coronation. There 'tis plain How fickle is kingly favour and disdain. [Here was performed âHenry VIII.,â Act 3, Scene 3 (the dialogue between Wolsey and Cromwell), followed by Scene 4 (the Coronation Procession of Anne Boleyn).] Later, you will perceive the measured pace And beauty of the gay Pavane, each grace And gesture setting forth the melody And joy of happy motion, full and free. And then in troop the sprightly Morris throng, Their dance a fitting close to rustic song. [Here was given a Pavane, followed by a Morris Dance.] In the fair Temple Gardens glow the roses, Both white and red, whose plucking soon discloses Fierce cause of deadly feud, for which, alas! Ere many summer joyous days shall pass, Many of England's bravest sons must bleed In direful civic strife, whose root was greed Of power: âIn our dear England's day of needâ (Hear this their voiceless cry) â'twere sweet indeed Against her foemen to defend her cause, Or die for herâto uphold her righteous laws. But thus, 'tis ill to die, merely that one Or other despot find his ill work done.â [Here was performed âHenry V.,â Act 1, Scene 4, (the Plucking of the Roses in the Temple Gardens).] See! Gloster hereâGloster with fawning tongue Envenomed, snake-like, deadly; for among Those near him is the youthful prince whose life He seeks; with hatred all his soul is rife. [Here was performed âRichard III.,â Act 3, Scene 1 (the Meeting of Edward V. and the Duke of Gloster).] And look, you now shall see that bold, old lover Falstaff, with ardour cooled, abashed discover Himself befooled when he essays to wage Victorious war with âmerryâ Mistress Page. [Here was performed âThe Merry Wives of Windsor,â Act 3, Scene 3 (the Buck-Basket Scene).] Great Shakespeare now approaches; he will read One of his âsugredâ sonnets; you will heed The matchless lofty music, rich and strong, The cadence of his pure, immortal song, Full of rare tact towards proud Elizabeth, Her name, by him enshrined, shall know no death. Leagued in the angel Mercy's âtwice-blessedâ cause, These scenes we bring before you. Your applause We take not to ourselves, 'tis meant for himâ London's chief bard whose glory grows not dim. [At the close of the Episodes was given a representation of Shakespeare and his Fellows being received by Queen Elizabeth and her Court, subsequent to a performance of âThe Comedy of Errors.â Shakespeare read his celebrated sonnet beginning: âNot marble, nor the gilded monuments,â in praise of the Queen.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PICTURES OF TRAVEL. PICTURES OF SPAIN. A SUMMER NOONTIDE. I.âPoverty. It is the silent summer noon: And the hour of rest comes never soon, For peasants who have stooped to toil Ere day-dawn on the sultry soil; Who feel the cooling breeze of morn Desert them, surely overborne By the fierce ardour of the sun Even when his race is scarce begun; Who pass the lagging, weary hours In longing for the pleasant bowers Of vine and olive intertwined, Where, in the shade, at length reclined, They quaff deep draughts of wine in peace, While Life's fierce troubles fade and cease. II.âWealth. A maiden sits within the shade Of yonder stately, cool arcade, By columns of rich marble made, Which bear designs, all chaste and pure, Of fruits and flowers whose shapes allure, And near their base an ancient crestâ A mailed knight with his lance in rest. The damask curtains here and there, Of richest stuffs, shut out the glare, Yet come faint gusts of cooler air. With what rare giftsâwhat lovelinessâ The happy days of Youth's caress Had dowered the maid, my words are cold To tell of. Tresses hued like gold Fall now upon her snow-white neck, Like the light clouds which oft-times fleck The wide expanse of summer sky At morn, before the sun is high. Her dress is simple, yet beseems Her rank: and but one jewel gleams Upon her bosom. You may trace In her an all-pervading grace Of form, of gesture, and of face,â Yet so diffused 'tis hard to tell Wherein the perfect grace may dwell. A SUMMER EVENTIDE. I.âIn the Country. 'Tis twilight's brief enchanting hour, The sun has lost his torrid power, Yet keeps enough of might to fling Sweet magic over everything. 'Tis not the beauty that you see At sunset on an English lea. 'Tis beauty all intensified, As if the Day-King in his pride Ordains that where his power is shown, His gifts of beauty shall be known. The noon-tide glow which all things steep In dreamless lethargyâthe sleep Of busy Nature now is past, And all things are reviving fast. The birds arouse themselves ere long, And sing a cheerful vesper song. The peasant takes his evening round To view his much-loved plot of ground, To find by scrutinising gaze How fare his olives, vines or maize. II.âIn the City. Palacio is a word applied to a mansion belonging to an ancient noble family. Plaza is the name given to a large square. Here in the city's roseal air People are moving everywhere With jest, or laugh, or snatch of song, Through square, through street, a changeful throng. And gentle ladies now appear, Graciously bending down to hear The honeyed nothings, soft and slow, Spoken by lovers from below; Each feigns bewitching bland surprise At praises of her lips or eyes. See yon palacio, grey and cold, Proud of his lineage, high and old, As he who owns it. Full and plain, Like many another such in Spain, From its carved windows you may see The chiefest plaza's revelry. And yet upon the other side Stretches a garden beautified By fountains clear, and still retreats, By terraced walks, and shady seats, And all the loveliness that Art In generous climates can impart. Now the moon rises, flinging far Her silvery flood of mellow light, And darkness can no longer mar The peerless loveliness of Night. That palm, which crowns yon neighbouring hill, Stands out, majestic, tall, and still; White gleam the city walls, and now Fall shadows from each olive bough, While clear against a starry sky Coldly the distant mountains lie. THE CITY OF THE CID. Burgos, the city of the Cid, all hail! Thou standest in the plain of old Castile, Fragrant with rare romance that still I feel, Albeit no more is heard the clang of mail Within thy grass-grown streets. And round about No hand of Change is working, and it seems Thou art unaltered, throned in thronging dreams Full of the sound of arms and warlike shout. How grand is thy cathedral's gorgeous pile! How quaint its frescoed front! These carven forms, Here sculptured, had their life as many storms Of care as ours throughout its weary while? These images of saints within, whose life, Judging but from their features, was all calm, Had they than we more nearly reached that balm Which Christians find the antidote of strife? No! Life was then a darker, fiercer thing Than now it is. For of a truth our lives Are moulded by our faith. He only thrives Whose faith is true of flight and strong of wing. And theirs, though firm, could never have been true, Since it forbade the purest Light to shine Which shows the truth on earth, that Light divine, By which God wills that Man his course should view And haply change if need be. Thoughts like these Come as home fruit seen under alien skies, As now I gaze around. Rich musings rise While looking on thee, Burgos,âsome which please, And some which sadden. When at close of day I stand in thy cathedral's solemn shades Among its peerless chapels, naught invades To break the sacred rest of aisle and bay. And more and more departs each common thought, And more and more I feel my soul is stirred, As if low music, sweet, though faintly heard, To me new founts of gentle bliss had brought. AT TOLEDO. The Fabrica de Armas at Toledo is celebrated. Toledo, like Rome, is built on seven hills. The Puerta del Sol, a still remaining Moorish gateway, is one of its finest relics. Burgos was once the Christian, and Toledo the Moorish capital of Spain. To speak en proprio Toledano has, since the fourteenth century, the time of Cervantes, been equivalent to the best Spanish. Toledo! what rare gems of memory From olden story gleam along thy name; What visions rise of victories won by thee Fruit of thy strong, thy flawless blades of fame. Little they reck, thy kings, who gazed around On yon fair city, fitted to be great,â Crowned on yon seven hills as Rome was crownedâ Little they reck of this thy last estate. Ah, yes! most noble once must thou have seemed, When the proud capital of lordly power, When in full glory southern sunshine beamed On lofty battlement and soaring tower. In days when from the âSun-gateâ oft at morn Issued a goodly Moorish martial train Of turbaned knights, ere starting, sternly sworn To conquer for the Crescent more of Spain. With scimitars unsheathed swift rode they forth, Their fury spreading terror all around Among the peasants, as towards the North, They spurred with Burgos as their furthest bound. Then afterwards returning, Victory Attendant on their flag, with what delight Would comrades greet them who had come to see And breathe the cooling freshness of the night. And when the sixth Alonso conquered thee, Thrusting thee back into the Christian fold, Then was thy people's accent held to be Of soft Castilian speech the noblest mould. And when, in later times, the Spanish name Had grown the most renowned in all the world, Lepanto learnt how true could be the aim Of keen Toledan darts adroitly hurled. Dream-pageants dazzle me, again, againâ As musing thus I pass upon my way, I feel no shame that it has given me pain To see thy sad, thy dull, thy slow decay. Farewell, far-famed Toledo! Nevermore Shall I forget thy mien, thou seem'st indeed Plunged in the deepest sleep. None can restore Spain's ancient cities. Life is what they need. PALMS BY MOONLIGHT AT ALICANTE. Palms by moonlight! waving palms, How the thought of you embalms In memory still the spot whereon I saw you last! Softly, wonderfully clear On that night did you appear Whose blissful hours, swift-winged, too soon, too soon, were past. Here the eye could range at will, And of beauty take its fill, Beauty so rare it soothed as soothes a heav'n-sent dreamâ Or a mellow Eastern tale Where the genii ride the gale And glide among such trees on many a moonlight gleam. For the strange ethereal sight Thrilled me with a new delight, While still the full-orbed moon o'er leaf o'er feathery bough From a sky of purest blue Silver glory gently threw. Then rapturous visions came I know not whence or howâ Visions, sweet and kind, that stole Through my hush'd and happy soul To strive against their power had been a vain endeavour, And, with ravished eye and heart, Wished I never to depart, Looking, I longed to live, and see these sights for ever. PICTURES OF MADEIRA. JO?O TO CONSTANÃA. (A lestÃ© Sunrise.) The lestÃ© is a south-east wind, frequently prevalent for several days. At the beginning or close of a lestÃ© the sunrises and sunsets are superb. Purple is the colour particularly prominent. Yonder flush across the sea Brings the morning back to me When you seemed to lend the light That dispersed the lingering night; When I heard your step, and knew Joy of joy! 'twas surely you; When I turned and saw your face, Saw you glide with girlish grace; Though before my heart was moved, Then it was that first I loved. Rosy cloudlets, lately dun, Seemed as now to hide the sun; Other cloudlets seemed to stand Ready waiting his command. Brighter, brighter grew the group, Every tint was in the troop, Red, and blue, and rich maroon, Fleecy white appearing soon, As at length we plighted troth, Hallowed moments for us both. O'er the peaks the vapoury shrouds Shifted with the shifting clouds; Faintly purpled clouds were spread O'er the peaceful ocean's bed; Clouds empurpled now, and grand, Cast a halo o'er the land. Every bird and opening flower Felt the gladness of the hour, As the gentle landward breeze Stirred the tall banana-trees. You remember how the day, While dawn's freshness wore away, Took a dimmer purple hue As the clouds were changed anew, You remember how we walked, You remember how we talked, How, beneath this trellised vine, Oft you told me you were mine, Each remembrance makes more clear All the debt I owe you, dear. FRANCISCA TO JASPEAR. An Idyl. The richâthe rich aloneâmay dream of death As solace for their sorrow, not the poor. Whate'er their grief, the poor have work to do If they would not behold their dear ones starve. Now were I dead there's none to pluck the fruit And sort it on our stall o' market days, Mother is ill, and through the scorching hours Father is busy 'mid the sugar-canes. It seems but yesterday since you and I, Happy with thoughts of coming happiness, Lived in the future, for the pleasant years Stretched all before us, fraught with all the joy That only love which changes not can give. Never shall I forget how once we sat Here where the orange-trees yield grateful shade, As with fond eyes of truth you told to me Once and again the sweet familiar tale That ever to a maiden's heart is new. Far, far beneath me, shimmering in the sun, Were palms with shapely branches, outlined now More clearly by the strong light pouring down, And nearer, on the left, an avenue Of red and white camellias full in flower Formed one long vista filled with varying hues, While countless clustering vines and citron trees Gleamed in a rare, a radiant mingled glow Of gorgeous colour. The banana-trees, Each with its fragrant load of luscious fruit, The graceful guavas with their light-green leaves, The loquats with their deeper verdant tints, The stately yam-trees with their blossoms white, Stood forth in all their loveliness together. Delightful was it, when the sun declined, To loiter with you as the breath of night Conquered the sultry ardour of the day; To see the moon rise over silent seas; To see the summer heavens, now decked with stars, Vie with the shafts of distance-mellowed light From many a cottage on the lone crag-sides In making a rich girdle round the bay; To hear the soft machÃªte The Portuguese guitar. play some air Of gayest sound, perhaps a mazy dance. Alas! alas for me, such hours of bliss Can nevermore return, for you are dead. Good were it if I lay where you are laid In that fair spot where one may hear the waves Break idly on the shingle beach below In noontide heat when scarce a lizard stirs; Where scented roses cling around the tombs Still blooming on throughout the sunny year. Yes, mother, I am coming, you must look At these my oranges, fresh plucked and ripe, And at my custard apples, they will be The finest in the market-place to-day. VERSES On a vase filled with sub-tropical flowers grown in the open air in December. Most beauteous flowers! Come ye to tell of summer hours, Of balmy breezesâlengthened days, Of warblers' blithesome lays? Thus come ye not, For not in summer lies your lot, No lengthened days attend your birth Nor songsters' vocal mirth. This is hardly true of Madeira to-dayâ1908âas so many species of birds have been brought thither since these lines were written. Yet gentle gales Are near, and sunshine still prevails, As in frail loveliness ye lie Too soon, alas! to die. Ah fair, how fair, Here Nature working everywhere,â If winter thus it makes to me, What must the spring-time be! And yet, although Each plant delights in southern glow, Upon no zephyr is there spent One breath of subtle scent. 'Tis England's flowersâ The lily and rose of English bowersâ Retain the perfume and the glow: These blossoms only blow. 'Tis England's spring Whose every floweret seems to bring New sweets to blend with every breeze Among the budding trees. Yet 'tis a power, This glory of each plant and flower, To make the poet's heart rejoice And sing with gladsome voice. The poet feelsâ Yet rarely even he revealsâ The restful store of blissful thought Such flowers to him have brought. âCHRISTMAS IN THE SUMMER SUNSHINE.â (Funchal.) Christmas in the summer sunshine! O how wonderful it seems,â Dowered with gladness are its moments, realizing poet-dreams, While its moments hasten from me, how I wish they came to stay,â How I wish their guileless pleasure nevermore might pass away. Softly play around my forehead breathings of the seaward breeze, As it stirs the swaying branches of the palms and orange-trees,â As it stirs the cactus growing on the gaunt uprising cliffs Hanging o'er the gleaming ocean dotted with the fishing skiffs. Nature here with slightest tendance grants her gifts of loveliest hueâ Gives among the vine-clad ridges wild-flowers purple, golden, blue,â Here azaleas, rich gardenias ope their blossoms to the air, With the rose and trained geraniumâwhose wild types are also fair. Pure and calm the moonlight radiance for the people as they pass On the eve of merry Christmas to and from the midnight mass; While the jocund serenaders through the balmy hours of night By their songs and sprightly music often bring a brief delight. Christmas in the summer sunshine! neither frost nor snow are here, Buoyant health can welcome winter but it fills the sick with fearâ Here the sick with friends around them spend a cheerful Christmas day, Thinking of but seldom pining for a chill home far away. ON THE ROAD TO CAMARA DE LOBOS January, 18â. The sun that is setting afar in the west In raiment of glory goes down to his rest, And, like a young maiden who wishes good-bye To the lover when leaving her, blushes the sky; How fair is the picture as now in the west In raiment of glory the sun goes to rest. The clouds in apparel of sunset appear, Apparel of beauty while Evening draws near, While calmly they watch o'er the sleep of the sea Unstirred by the breezes. How wondrous to me Is the peace of the picture, as now in the west In raiment of glory the sun goes to rest. How peerless and perfect God's painting appears, His delicate work never fades with the years; His painting now quiet, now wild beyond speech, Man only can copy, man never can reach In grandeur. So thought I, as now in the west In raiment of glory the sun goes to rest. OTHER PICTURES OF TRAVEL. AT SEAâOFF THE MOUTH OF THE GARONNEâSUNSET. A twilit halo gilds the troubled sky, And gilds the heaving waters far and nigh; About me here is some strange loveliness Which, as the shadows deepen, grows not less. Hark! Now, not once or twice, but o'er and o'er In solemn grandeur comes the deep-voiced roar Of strong Atlantic surges; where I stand I look, but see no welcome speck of land. How beautiful is yonder distant sail Illumined yet; but soon my eyes must fail To trace its further course, for it will be Lost in the glory of the sunset sea. And as I gaze, and gaze, dim thoughts ariseâ Thoughts of Man's destiny; these callous skies Seem types of earthly cruelty, and now The sea, like man, is sadâI know not how. The air is still; no wingÃ¨d wanderer cleaves The silence in his flight, as Night receives Ere long her stately queen the crescent moon, Whose glimmering beams show all the billows soon. AFTER SUNSET OFF PAUILLAC. (Gironde.) The day is gone, but yonder fading streaks Of light still fleck the bosom of the sky. Swart Night comes swiftly. Hark, that sound bespeaks My nearness to the ocean, 'tis the cry Of some belated sea-bird, and I hear The ripples at my feet. A low sweet song Monotonous, yet musical and clear, Is breeze-borne from a vessel's deck along. The crew raise anchor quickly, and away She glides into the gloom, while growing low And ever lower sounds the roundelay. What now may be her fortune none can know. Like her, o'er Life's strange, trackless sea we sail, Nor know if calm or tempest will prevail. THE SOUTHERN NIGHT. (The Valley of the Gave de Pau.) Ah! lovelier comes the southern night Than night of northern skies, Where tedious twilight mocks the flight Of day that slowly diesâ Here placid Evening's starry veil O'er all is swiftly castâ Here peace seems wafted on the galeâ And care awhile is past. In southern summer's mellow night How sweet it is to stray 'Mid fairest scenes which soft moonlight Make fairer far than day! How fair the widely stretching woods That gird the spacious plain, While watchful Silence, queen-like, broods O'er them in sombre reignâ How fair the river's crystal thread, Seen faintly from afar, As silvery starlight now is shed From many a tranquil star. In southern summer's mellow night How sweet it is to stray 'Mid fairest scenes which soft moonlight Make fairer far than day! How fair the crested mountains lie, Distant, yet wondrous clear, Their snow-capt peaks against the sky Uprising tier on tier;â How fair the sleeping landscape seems, While here and there are heard Sounds bringing Music's richest dreams Or laughter-laden word. In southern summer's mellow night How sweet it is to stray 'Mid fairest scenes which soft moonlight Make fairer far than day! WILD ROSES AND SNOW. (Basses PyrenÃ©es.) How sweet the sight of roses In English lanes of June, When every flower uncloses To meet the kiss of noon. How strange the sight of rosesâ Roses both sweet and wildâ Seen where a valley closes 'Mid mountain heights up-piled Upon whose sides remaining Is strewn the purest snow, By its chill power restraining The tide of Spring's soft glow. Yet God who gave the pureness To yon fair mountain snow, Gives also the secureness Whereby these roses blow. NEAR ST. SAUVEUR. (Hautes PyrenÃ©es.) Lo, what a glorious prospect is revealedâ Mountains and snow, and pine-trees beauty-clad! On many a sloping edge of awesome heights Reposes gracefully a misty veil In wreaths almost transparent; but ev'n now Its mass divides, and clear against the sky Rises each giant summit, still and grand, Proud that its lone, its vast, its God-wrought strength Defies so long decay. I needs must feel Nature is great, and Man is impotent, Yet ah, how much his art hath made increase To this rare store of beauty. Each small patch Perceived upon the mountain side, reclaimed From barren wilderness, what power it hath To cheer the eye. To me it often seems As though no prospect reached perfection till It showed some kindly trace of human toil. ON LOOKING UP THE VALE OF CAUTERETS BY NIGHT. (Hautes PyrenÃ©es.) Though night is here, In outline soft I see A vista through the gloom, where, mirrored clear, Gleam rock and peak and tree. The mountain forms In solemn grandeur rise, Each summit still the strength of countless storms For countless years defies. The dark-green pines Clothe all the slopes aroundâ How lone these slopes on which each cold star shines! Nor doth a single sound Invade the calm,â Or by its presence change The sense of vastness, soothing like a balm From heaven, so new and strange. ON THE LAKE OF GENEVA. A silvern haze is over all. At hand Are gently swaying poplars, rippling larches, And firmly rooted firs, while further off Gleam azure waters of the waveless lake. Beyond again are mountains; not, as oft, Gaunt snow-capped monarch peaks, but bright with verdure. The rocks throw shadows quaint upon the grass; White chÃ¢lets peep among the clustering vines Gay boats glide smoothly on with placid sails Widely outspread. LINES Suggested by seeing, at the summit of the Simplon Pass, a stone, fragment of some rude ancient carving, brought perhaps from a neighbouring valley for road-making purposes. The stone had lain doubtless for a long time near the spot where I saw it. There was some desultory fighting in the Italian Alpine Valleys before Napoleon the First's decisive victory at Marengo. Many, perchance, have been, quaint carven stone, Your harsh vicissitudes, how came you here? Change spares not even you, though you have known No soul-distress, nor Sorrow's blinding tear, Nor deep unutterable heart-wrought fear. Did you of some small fane once form a part Where vesper hymns arose at close of day, Where lovers true were linkÃ¨d heart to heart, And humble villagers approached to pray, Then, rising, went refreshed upon their way? And did fierce war destroy your place of peace Where some forgotten skirmish happened there Ere yet the Austrian yoke was made to cease By famed Marengo? Bullets did not spare The lowly church, and fire soon laid it bare. Maybe, when fickle Time had brought neglect, When reverence was a thing of long ago, When none in all the hamlet had respect For its old ruined shrine, they came to throw Its remnants thus away, and used you so. Near you, must oft have wandered weary men 'Mid dire storm-battles fought on wintry nights;â Near you, perchance, have happened now and then More wondrous deeds, more awe-inspiring sights Than sages know in whom the world delights. What mighty tempests must have passed you by When 'mid the riven mountains thunder pealed, And storm-clouds came apace athwart the sky In mad career, while Nature half revealed The grandeur of the tumult, half concealed Its majesty and power. The silent snows Must oft have lain upon you, when the hands Of Winter framed his lofty couch, and chose His glacier lairsâwhen all the higher lands Loomed ghastly, shuddering at his dread commands In solemn midnight hours when callous stars Shine down on snow-drifts, on the glaciers lone, And on snow-laden pines: when nothing mars That spectacle to human eyes scarce known, Where Nature rears 'mid rocks her frost-bound throne. Yet are you broken now to make a roadâ Fallen from your pristine state, and haply too You will be worthless in your chill abode, And shrink from man's unfeeling, heedless view In your small nook, ignoble, poor, and new. SUNDAY MORNING OFF MAZAGAN, MOROCCO. A magic city Fancy-dight, Thou seem'st this tranquil Sabbath day, Strange town all glittering, treeless, white, Begirt with sand and seething sprayâ Lit by the sun whose rays reveal Each flat-roofed Orient dwelling-place,â Each stately mosque, each well whose wheel A camel turns with tireless pace. Dark Moors in their fantastic dress, In haste to reach us, leave the shore,â They make the distance less and less, So strong the stroke of each long oar. Now they have reached us and with pride Disdain the aid the steps afford, Bare feet from heel-less slippers glide, And, cat-like, quick they spring on board. All speak at once, with gestures quaint, And few but in an unknown tongue, Those in the boats take up the plaint, And on the deck still more have sprung. A single ship is in the bay Besides our own,âno others ride At anchor. And she goes her wayâ But not until to-morrow's tide. And from her mizen-mast there floatsâ Dear sight to every British heartâ That flag whose mingled hue denotes A union naught should ever part. A welcome standard! 'tis a signâ A welcome signâthat some are here Who worship at a common shrine, Who pray like meâlike me revere. IN THE NEW FOREST. Most clear! most fair! The swelling woodland lies, Stretching in leafy glory everywhere Before my wondering eyes. Here mighty oaks, Stalwart, and vast, and strong, A thousand years have faced the tempest's strokes, Have been the home of song. Here wave the boughs Of tall and sombre pines, Here stands âthe temple of beeches,â made for vows Of love when softly shines The summer moon. Here tremulous branches sway Of sun-lit birches,âon the sward at noon Their shadows seem at play. I linger still In this sweet solitude, Wishing my care-sick mind could taste at will The healing sylvan mood. EVENING IN THE FOREST OF MEUDON. (Seine et Oise.) Returning sometimes âfrom the fields of sleep,â I seem to see that twilight once again, That twilight as mysterious, rich, and deep, As yonder blackbird's strain. I see the sombre loveliness around; I feel the sense of awe, the enthralling peace, Of Nature's woodland silence, for no sound Makes here that silence cease. Anon I see the waters of the lake Gleam in the last hues of the sunset glow, While here and there the lazy cattle slake Their thirst, and homeward go. But hear, O hear, that sudden burst of song, At last it is the full-voiced nightingales! While mellow cuckoos sing, and so prolong Music as daylight fails. Long hours have passed, and man and beast and bird Rest; yet my heart is filled with pure delight; And lo, a single nightingale is heard Amid the moonless night. THE CHILD COWPER AT BERKHAMPSTEAD. âwhere the gard'ner Robin, day by day, Drew me to school along the public way.â Cowper, My Mother's Picture. Bright beams of sunshine lit the lawn, And all the landscape seemed as drawn From some enchanter's treasure;â The birds were singing loud and clear, But most perchance he loved to hear The blackbird's cheery measure. And while he loiter'd 'neath the trees Soft scents were wafted by the breeze That blew across the hay-field Where village children then resorted, And as among the swaths they sported Transformed it to a play-field. Did these dear visions fade away? They didâand for their death that day He felt a throb of sorrow; But gladness came in sorrow's place When Hope said with her smiling face, â'Twill live again to-morrow.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS FOUNDED ON HISTORY. THE KEEPING OF THE VOW. A.D. 1330. King Robert Bruce is dying now, Heavily comes his breath, And that last strife 'twixt death and life Will soon be won by death; Around his couch the liegemen stand; They heave full many a sigh, In dire dismay and grief are they To know their liege must die. âSir James of Douglas, come!â he cries, âEver wert thou my friend, And though we part, 'tis well thou art With me unto the end. âWhen great my need I vowed to God If He would grant to me That war's surcease should bring us peace, And Scotland should be free, âHis blessÃ¨d banner I would bear To holy Palestine, With arms to quell the Infidel: Such was your King's design. âSore grieved am I that here I lieâ Death's hand upon my browâ In vain, in vain, 'mid gnawing pain, Do I recall my vow. âThen promise me right faithfully, When I am laid at rest, That with my heart thou wilt depart To do my last behest!â âMy liege, I pledge my knightly word, Thy bidding shall be done, The work is sad, yet am I glad Such favour to have won! âSafe in my bosom shall thy trust Abide with me for ever, Unless, perchance, in peril's hour, 'Twere best that we should sever. âSo shall thy vow be kept, my king, To do thy last behest I swear upon the holy Rood,â So shall thy soul have rest.â The king smiles faintly in replyâ Then slowly droops his head, And on the breast of him he loved Robert the Bruce lies dead. In fit array at break of day Doth Douglas soon depart, And in a casket carefully He keeps that Kingly Heart. Crossing the main and sighting Spain, He joins the truceless war Of Moor and Christianâthat fierce strife Which rages as of yore; For here he knows that of a truth His devoir first should be, And with his host he swells the boast Of Spanish chivalry. The armies twain on Tebas's plain Outspreadâa goodly sight! Eager they wait with hope elate, Impatient for the fight; The summer sunbeams on the shields Of warriors brightly glancing, Illume the mail of many a man And many a charger prancing, And gallant crest that in the breeze Full gaily now is dancing; Each Moslem there with scimitar, Upon his Arab horse, Moves with a calm, a fearless mien, Unswerving in his course. Lo here at length the stately strength The Cross and Crescent wield, As deadly foes now darkly close Upon this fatal field. The Spaniards' stroke hath broken through The dense opposing line! Yet none the less both armies press Around their standard-sign, And many a jennet of Castile Runs free with dangling rein, While many a Paynim once so proud Lies lifeless on the plain. First in the van the Douglas rides, With all his men-at-arms,â A worthy company are they To front the Paynim swarms. With bloody spur and loosened rein They break the stubborn foe, So swift the chase they scarce can trace The course by which they go, Till, looking back upon their track, The Paynim ranks they see Have closed them in, 'mid dust and din With shout of wolfish glee. âWe find full late the danger great,â Sir Douglas cries, âreturn! And charge the foe like Scots we know The rout at Bannockburn. âSurely the men who conquered then Vain Edward's mighty host Will never yield this sacred field Nor let the base Moor boast.â So, boldly speaking, quick he turnsâ He gallops to the rearâ This dauntless quest through fierce unrest As gallant doth appear As his who braves the foam-flaked waves To succour one most dear. As Douglas passed the blows fell fastâ Stern was the conflict wild, With steeds and men, who ne'er again Would rise, the field was piled. Yet, with his followers not a few, Now he has cleft his way With flashing eye and flashing blade Straight through the grim array, Once more he glances round, and sees, Still in the thickest fight, William Sinclair, his well-beloved, A very valiant knight. Full oft had they in tourney gay Their chargers deftly wheeled, Full oft were nigh in days gone by On many a battle field,â âRide to the rescue!â Douglas shouts, âRide on, and do not spare, To save him from a woeful death Which of you will not dare!â Urging his horse with headlong force, He seeks to render aid, And many a tunic's fold is cleft By his resistless blade; Yet is he left, of friends bereft, Swart foemen all around, Through the echoing strokes on helm and shield Of help there comes no sound. Now snatches he the jewelled casque Where lies the heart he loves, ('Tis strange to see how tenderly His mailed hand o'er it moves), And flings it forward, forward yet, With this his battle cry, âPress on, brave Heart, as thou wert wont: I follow thee, or die!â With lifted lance he makes advance To where his treasure fell, Each crash of blowânow fast, now slowâ Like a rude requiem knell, And left alone, yet ne'er o'erthrown, He grapples with the foe, Until a sword-thrust piercing him At last doth lay him low. Then gallantly he struggles still, Half kneeling on the plain, And there, o'erwhelmed by many a wound, The peerless knight is slain. So died the chief, his life well lost In Scottish hero's work, The stainless Douglas, he who sleeps In mossy Douglas kirk. THE PURITAN'S FAREWELL TO HIS BETROTHED. (1642.) SHEâ When Love arose and taught my heart To hold thee first and chief, I never dreamed that we should part In pain beyond belief, Then wherefore bring this aching woe To me, to thee, to all, E'en though harsh Duty bids thee go To obey thy faction's call?HEâ Nay, speak not so; that sigh, that look, Wound worse than blades of steel, Yet what were I if I forsook, Because of thine appeal, No âfactionâ but God's righteous cause, No struggle of greed and shameâ One stern last stand for Right and laws That win His high acclaim? Truth, Justice, Conscience plead with me, Then wouldst thou have me, dear, For calm and ease and joy with thee To yield to craven fearâ To prove a recreant from the rightâ A coward sore afraidâ A traitor in the coming fight Where England needs mine aid? Thou murmur'st, âWe shall meet no more:â I know, I know thy pain, Our life is brief, but when 'tis o'er True lovers live againâ They live again in that fair land Where comes nor strife nor swordâ Where Truth and Joy go hand in handâ And Love hath Faith's reward. There, where each feeling stands confessed, Wilt thou know all my sorrowâ Wilt know what pangs have rent my breast Ere leaving thee to-morrow. Lo, hearken to the distant chime, To us a knell of sadness, Then let us spend our span of time In peace more deep than gladness.SHEâ The weakness goes: oh, heed it not! My fears have done thee wrong; My pain is but my woman's lot, And Love shall make me strong:â In these brave arms I will be brave, And while thou still art here, To God will lift my soul, and crave The peace which casts out fear. THE TAKING OF THE FLAG. The dawning light Hath banished Night, Breaking the ocean's sleepâ For all around Is heard a sound Of war upon the deep. The Dutch and we Are met at sea On this blithe summer day, To try at length Our fighting strength In battle's bloody fray. See! on the right Two ships in fight In struggle long and hard, And though so near, They know not fear, Close grappling yard to yard. In very joy An orphan boy Speaks 'mid the battle's roar: âSince morning's sun The fight has run,â When will it then be o'er?â â'Twill never lag Till yon Dutch rag The epithet âDutch ragâ is said to have been the actual phrase used by the sailor whom Hopson addressed. The boy had only joined the fleet on the day before as a volunteer, and had previously been a tailor's apprentice. Vide âSea Fights,â p.73. Professor Sir J. K. Laughton, in âThe Dictionary of National Biography,â expresses his opinion, however, that the incident on which this poem is based has no historical foundation. Down from the mast-head runs, No other sign Along our line Can silence British guns.â âIf thus it be,â Then swift quoth he With keen and flashing eye; â'Twill soon be past, Nor longer last, Though if I fail, I die.â Hid by the cloak Of sable smoke, All noiselessly he goes; He springs elate Where Death may wait Among his country's foes. High up their mast He clambers fast: He grasps his precious prize:â He knows no checkâ He gains the deck, With triumph in his eyes. He bounds once more 'Mid smoke and roar To his appointed place; Fearless, serence, Is still his mien, Fearless, serene his face. Our men with glee Shout âVictory!â Right glad of heart are they; And from each gun The Dutchmen run In wonder and dismay. A sudden shame, Half rage, half blame, Their captain overpowers; With one accord Our sailors board, And soon the ship is ours. And of the youth Who thus in truth Had won a hero's meed, We spoke with pride Till far and wide Was known his peerless deed. THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN HUNT. January 8th, 1761. See âBattles of the British Navy,â vol. i., p. 210. The watch on board the Unicorn Look out at dawn of light, The sails are here, the sails at last! The Frenchman heaves in sight. And swiftly now the order comes To give the Frenchman chase, The Frenchman who is lost, we know, If we can win the race. Hurrah! the coward's flight is vain, The ships are drawing nigh, Each man prepares to win the fightâ To win the fight or die. And soon the cannons' smoke and boom Are rolling all around, Through two fierce hours of clangorous strife Is heard the deadly sound; Wild scene of strange delirious joy, Yet desolating woe, For now a shot our captain fells, And he is borne below. Two seamen gently bear him down, And while the surgeon tries To bind his wound, he looks on us With tender, pitying eyes. The strife ne'er staysâthe bearers bring Another blood-stained man. âSurgeon,â our captain says at once, âGo, save him if you can. âMy wound is mortal; thus for me Your care is all in vain, Not so with him, then use your power To ease his heavier pain.â Soon ebbed our captain's tide of lifeâ Short was the time for himâ Yet still his constant mind was clear Although his eyes grew dim. And in a while his heart was glad For we had won the day, His noble heart was satisfiedâ His spirit passed away. THE BATTLE'S PAUSE. (Supposed episodes at Waterloo during an imaginary cessation of the strife and din.) I. At daybreak on a lonely sea Strange is the silence; heavily The louring clouds loom dim and dun, Till comes at length the far-off sun; Strange is the silence of the day Where waves are hushed in some fair bay; Strange is the silence,âawesome, deep, At nightfall in an ancient keep; Strange is the silence that ofttimes Broods o'er the city's shame and crimes; Strange is the silence of the night Where throned in space the stars give light; Strange is the silence of the room Where lingering sickness hangs in gloom; Strange is the silence after death Where anguished sound departs with breath; But stranger is the silence when The moans are stilled of wounded men, Where stilled an instant are the cries That from wild scenes of strife arise As noise of rapid volleys cease,â As God grants here and there release,â As suddenly the senses yield To silence on the battle-field. II. In these fleet moments interposed Ere yet once more the foemen closed, In inner vision every man Lived o'er again his whole life's span. Only of plunder many thought, But here and there was one who caught Swift glimpses, borne on spirit-wings, Of God, of Heaven, of holy thingsâ Who felt his courage no less high Because he was prepared to die. III. One dreams of his betrothed in France, A dark-eyed girl with laughing glance, And wonders if he soon shall meet Her tender looks, her smile so sweet. âAh, ma Lucille,â with tears he cries, âFain would I see the glad surprise Break the calm gaze of your dear eyes, As with high hope I come once more, Unwounded from the field of war. Fain would I see your rippling curls, More precious than those lustrous pearls My gift to youâthat sometimes deck The stately beauty of your neckâ That on your bosom rise and fall, White rivals of its whiteness, all Eclipsed in utter loveliness. Fain would I see again that dress; Its dainty hue of mellow brown Sets off the clustering curls that crown Your shapely head. Fain would I see The happy village revelry That joyous day which makes you mineâ When underneath the ancient vine Around Saint Etienne's porch we pass Just coming from the wedding Mass, And leaving near to the altar stair The curÃ© with his silvery hair, Low kneeling now in holy prayer, To crave a blessing on us there, His guileless, gladsome, saintly soul As spotless as his pure white stole.â IV. Another soldier sees a room O'ershadowed by a partial gloom, As heavy curtains shade the light From a wan sufferer's weakened sight, And on a couch is seen a boy, Whose wasted face, all flushed with joy, Looks on a portrait, newly there, Of a tall youth with raven hair, Clad in a garb of martial hue. And then in accents heartfelt, true, He speaks the words: âWould that I too With my dear brother still could be Where Valour leads to Victory.â V. A Scotsman here among âThe Greysâ Chafes inly now at war's delays,â Would but the bugle sound the charge! Would that he were once more at large Among the flying cuirassiers! He knows no pity, knows no fears,â For him each instant passes slow Passed not in fight against the foe,â 'Tis hard to stand, nor give one blowâ It suits his fiery humour ill To be a living target still, Nor use his good sword at his will. Near him âThe Inniskillingsâ share A post of danger,âeverywhere True soldiers they,âwho greatly dare. VI. Before an English soldier lie Down-trodden fields of wheat and rye, But his tired vision does not meet These blood-stained fields of rye and wheat. He sees not how his comrades here Reveal no sign of craven fear; While they with bandaged hand or face, Still struggle on, nor quit their place. He sees not, as in many rifts The smoke of battle, rising, lifts, How everywhere all undismayed Still firm they stand as on parade, Although their thinning ranks disclose How hard with them the conflict goes. He sees the Mersey; fresh and cool The east wind blows from Liverpool To Seacombe beach, where, loitering, He stood one early morn of spring A month or two before. The day At first had seemed but chill and grey Till brilliant sunshine suddenly Had flooded all the estuary. For weeks the west wind had prevailedâ No ship, if outward bound, had sailed; But now the fickle wind had veered, And now the sailors' hearts were cheered, While a whole fleetâa gallant show Of eager shipsâwas free to go. Full many a vessel, towards the bar Across the waters near and far, Moves buoyantly. With what delight He looks upon the goodly sight Of canvas spread to catch the breeze That dances o'er the rippling seas! How shapely are the skiffs which pass Between him and St. Nicholas! How graceful is the distant town, Which gaily o'er the waves looks down! Changed is the scene since 'mid the snow He saw it scarce a year ago. Then many a white and large ice-floe Reared its strange shape on every side, While tossing idly on the tide. VII. Another soldier sees his home Where whirls the wild Biscayan foam; Where surges beat with sullen roar Upon a dreary pine-clad shore. There his good mother yet must wait For many a month disconsolate, Waiting, still waiting for her child, With heavy heart unreconciled To his long absenceâher distress At times most pitiful to guess. He sees her in her peasant's dress At household duties, at her door At eve and morning, evermore Thinking with heavy heart of him; With unshed tears her eyes grow dim, Looking, aye looking constantly, Across the same sad, dreary sea. Again he hears the gleeful noise And clatter of the village boys, He even hears the sound once more Of sabots on a cottage floor. Again it seems that mournful day When he, alas, was called away; Again he sees the fishing-boat That comes to bear him to the town; Again his home grows more remote As o'er the sea the sun goes down. Still he beholds his mother's face, And still he feels her warm embrace, He knows her anguished doubts, her fears, And would-be smiles, he feels her tears. He hears the heaving waters nighâ He sees, above, an angry sky, Dark, yet with streaks of mingled grey, Fading while swiftly dies the day. He passes to the gathering gloom As though to some impending doom; Drear seems the earth, the sky, the mainâ He feels that Nature knows his pain. VIII. A youthful soldier looked around Upon the ghastly battle ground. He was a conscript, ne'er before Had he beheld the face of War, He saw not all its deeps of pain, For former scenes arose again, Once more he was a child at play, In that steep village street which lay, Crag-perched, 'mid tree-boles gnarled and grey With age. It was the close of day. Was that the church he knew of old, That the rude cross where he was told The story of the ancient time So full of mystery, lust, and crime? Ah, how he loved yon olive wood, To him how sweet its solitude, How oft on many a summer night He watched from there the fading light, Till grew more bright and yet more bright The distant lamps of great Marseilles, And when at length the daylight fails, Fair seem the stars, fair seems the sea, Ah, how at once his memory Brings back for him these moonlit hours 'Mid fragrance of the orange flowers. Fresh is the air, and soft and still, Save when the mistral brings its chill. Once more he feels the morning breeze Which gently curls the azure seas Around his father's fishing-boat, That like a live thing seems to float. Lovely it looks with dark brown sail, Outspread to catch each gentle gale. And when the noontide comes at length The crew refresh their waning strength By frugal meal, or merry jest, By games, or cheerful talk, or rest. One man had fought where waned the star Of France in fight off Trafalgar; Another speaks of Austerlitz, And shows the combat as he sits. With eager words, with eyes aflame, He tells the tale, âThe Emperor came To our right flank when sore distressed: We needed succour, needed rest, Yet better was his presence then Than of a thousand untired men.â So, early stirred the martial fire In the boy's breastâthe fond desire To win the soldier's honoured name, To win the soldier's meed of fame. To him an order comes ere long To join the army; 'mid a throng Of youths he gains a barrack square, Strange seems the ceaseless bustle there. Here well-groomed horses drink their fill; Here is an active squad at drill; Here words of gaiety he hears; And here a mother stands in tears; Here stands a veteran hale, erect, In garb that points to no neglect, Though he has marched full many a mile, In blazing sunshine all the while, A faultless soldier he has been, No chance of war could change his mien; Here stands a youth with shambling gait, In soldier's dress, yet unelate, With stupid look, and vacant face, As though his garb were some disgrace; Here agile gunners clean a gun; And here, his day's work nearly done, A driver of the army train Brings in his store of food and grain. The conscript thinks with what glad heart In scenes like these he took a part. With joy his boy's heart overflows, He longs to smite his country's foes, Of what he leaves he scarce takes heed, Civilian clothes he doffs with speed, To him his uniform brings life, He thinks of glory in the strife. He thinks, as now the sun goes down, Of lasting honour and renown; To him War is not sad, but strangeâ It gives him motion, stir, and change. Through all the long, the happy marches Across Provence, now bright with spring, He sees the gay triumphal arches, He hears once more the joy-bells ring. And then one day, through beat of drums, He hears the cry, âThe Emperor comes,â âThe Emperor comesââon every side They pass the word with looks of pride. Each soldier feels his courage rise, Fresh pleasure sparkles in his eyes, And while he stands the more upright, Sees his accoutrements are bright, And hopes his bayonet, sword, or lance Will seem to that all-piercing glance As sword or bayonet ought to look. For who could bear the sharp rebuke Or face his comrades' words or jeers, Or worse, his comrades' covert sneers, At one the Emperor deigned to chide? An hour has gone; the corps espied The staff approaching, near a wood. It stood to arms. Kind Nature's mood Was peaceful: there the stock-dove coo'd; The dreamer sees one purple flower, Which decked the spot that sunny hour. âThe Emperor is an altered man Since Leipsic,â says a veteran. And yet the great Napoleon seems The ideal of a soldier's dreams, As now he passes on his course, Erect upon his snow-white horse Amid his marshals. Soult and Ney, Heroes of many a well-fought day, Ride near him now, in gayest trim. They jest, and sometimes speak with himâ Yet never seem to lose the senseâ Of that strange man's strange influenceâ Of that magnetic, cruel power By which Napoleon, hour by hour, Until his fiery race was run, Remorselessly swayed every one. Firm are his lips, stern are his eyesâ Hard eyes, where naught of gladness lies; Yes signs there are of wasting life, Wasting through care and lust of strife, That drooping lip, that haggard cheek, Of pain, of ebbing force, they speak. But none, save veterans here and there, Perceive his chill, his altered air; The troops, o'erjoyed to see his face, See in his glance a sign of grace: His presence cures their every ill, And âVive l'Empereur!â their shout is still. IX. A tranquil, sunlit village green Sees one young Englishman: between A row of elms he catches sight Of one dear cottage; to the right Lies the grey rectory, and beyond Old Farmer Granger's ricks and pond, Just where the high road quickly dips. Here as a child he sailed his ships, While loafers from the alehouse near Gladdened his heart by words of cheer, And showed him how to set his sail, To woo the soft, the favouring gale. He sees again the long sea beach A mile or two from home; the reach The farm-folk call the Little Broad Gleams in the sun, while boys applaud His feats of strength; or on the sea Perchance he rows right merrily, While myriad skylarks, singing, soar Above the sand cliffs on the shore; Or looking seaward from the land He views the sunset vague and grand. X. A Frenchman thinks with many a fear Of his one sisterâvery dear Is she to him, a girl most fair. He sees e'en now her dark-brown hair, And inly speaks, âHerself a flower She hawks sweet blossoms hour by hour Through many a parched Parisian street, Gladly, though oft with toil-worn feet. 'Tis she who wins the daily bread And shelter for my father's head, Since age and sickness disallow Him strength to earn his living now; While I, who should have been their stay, Without appeal am forced away, Simply because some menâwhose aims I do not know and scarce their namesâ Have fixedly resolved on War. And Iâone of their human storeâ Am made to face death at their will Till kings and emperors have their fill.â How strange are we! he who so dreamed And all unpatriotic seemed, When fierce again began the strife, Fought with the bestâcared not for life. The vision changes, and he sees The comely, the belovÃ¨d trees That droop in summer's sultry blaze, Along the white Parisian ways. In one old street he sees a spot Shaded by lime-trees: there is not A cooler nook, and side by side An old man and a maid abide In sweet affectionate converse there, To rest, to breathe its fresher air. 'Tis those he loves, and for a space He treads himself that well-known place, So keen his inner sight. And soon His sister starts through afternoon Long hours, and near the Tuileries She stays, then moves along the quays. She is so fair, so pure, so sweet, She seems to gladden all the street. And many glance at her, and smile; They note her brave looks all the while, They know her toil of every day, Toil such as wears her youth away. And one, an honest artisan, A homely, upright, thrifty man, Poring o'er some long cherished plan, Passing, thinks, âWould she were my wife, Happy were I though hard my life.â And with a Frenchman's frugal care He saves, and saving, dreams of her. Although from childhood's earliest days She knew the drear Parisian ways (Gay to the rich, drear to the poor), From every harm she walks secure, From virtue none her steps allure. In thought, in actions, she is good, Kindness her constant habitude. She raises soft and pleading eyes With something of a chaste surprise At many a word, at many a sight, That comes to her by day, by night. All innocence without, within, She sees, yet sees not, all their sin. XI. Thus runs each hapless soldier's dream In that short pauseâthat restful gleam Of blessÃ¨d peace. But, hark, there comes The gathering roll of distant drums Beating the charge, and then the sound Of musketry. Men gaze around Half in surpriseâthen hear again The clash of arms, the cry of pain, The wounded horse's neigh; and so Fateful with pain the gaunt hours go. THE LOSS OF H.M.S. âVICTORIA.â June 22nd, 1893. Let Britain mourn for these her gallant sons, Who, seeing death was certain, yet remained Steadfast to duty, all unconsciously Grown to be heroes,âmourn for them whose souls, Fired with immortal courage, conquered fear. Let Britain grieve with them who, silent, weep A loss irreparable with bitter tears. Let Britain grieve for him who, though he erred Soon felt perchance, in feeling he had erred, An agony more great than death itself. Let Britain still rejoice, for now she knows, Though Time and Science change the face of war, The stuff of British hearts they cannot change. TRUE SONS OF BRITAIN. âThe heart of the colony is with her Imperial mother.ââ Extract from a resolution at a meeting to raise a volunteer contingent for South Africa, held at St. John's, Newfoundland. True sons of Britain, though your home Is not these isles amid the foam,â Ye come across the unfettered sea, Speaking the world-speech of the free. Your mother needs you; and from far Ye haste, with dreams of Trafalgar, Of Wolfe, of Wellington, and all Who, like heroic Gordon, fall. Her daughter-lands no more apart, Proud Britain feels her mother's heart Throb with fond joy as now she shows A steadfast front to all her foes. Constant ye stand; nor fear the foe, True is your aim as his; although Each league upon the veldt he knows, And every league is strange to those Who come, like you, from far and nigh, In Britain's cause to live or die; Ready for her to shed their blood, To seal eternal brotherhood. Her daughter-lands no more apart, Proud Britain feels her mother's heart Throb with fond joy as now she shows A steadfast front to all her foes. Greater than Carthage, Rome, or Greece, Is now your mother grown; and peace Is still her watchword, prayer, and hope, Yet with her foes she aye must cope; Or cast her honour from its place; Or lose the freedom of her race; Or lose the Empire, all her own, The vastest that the world has known. Her daughter-lands no more apart, Proud Britain feels her mother's heart Throb with fond joy as now she shows A steadfast front to all her foes. November 10th, 1899. QUEEN VICTORIA. Obiit., January 22nd, 1901. The musician Grief With mystic power hath played upon the heart, And, through the heart, hath opened wide the door Of that most sacred sanctuaryâthe soul. Each of us is an instrument; and each Is, in some notes at least, diversely strung From all our fellows; yet in this we know One harmony of universal love. We seem to see The wintry woods around thy âpalace wallsâ Above the tossing Channel, fraught with much Of Britain's story, and we think of him, Thy friend, our Tennyson, whose âclear callâ brought âNo moaning of the bar.â No more, no more Shall thy loved Scotland know thy kindly face Among her hills and glens; nor shalt thou join Again in her dear customs; or in these Religious rites of hers, homely and sweet. Once we remembered that thou wert for us The mighty Personage whose reign hath seen A grandeur greater even than the days Of Shakespeare and of Ralegh; that to thee We owed wise counsel, fruit of toilsome hours Of patient thought, and converse with the men Of genius who have graced our commonwealth For three and sixty years; a queen whose realms Rich with the spoils of Science, had grown strong With valiant Colonies which girt the world. To-day we deem that thy long, blameless life Hath aided, under God, our race to grow The noblest on this earth. And now, and now For thee we pray not; for ourselves we pray: With thee 'tis well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. AN AUTUMN REMINISCENCE. A radiant garden rises on my view Where through the glowing hours the sunrays fall Gently through hazel boughs; while brooklets brawl O'er beds where gleam the pebbles brown and blue. Here, in that calm which never once they knew On earth, dead heroes keep the slopes in thrallâ And russet ferns thereon, and dahlias tall, And lilies white, and flowers of mingled hue. Small wonder that these storied warrior forms Should now in sculptured stone have rest, when I Find here that Life's fierce conflicts seem to ceaseâ Find respite here from all Life's rudest storms:â Where still and silent 'neath a pale grey sky Fair and contented Nature lies at peace. AT THE GRAVE OF DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI. April 9th, 1883. Rossetti died at Birchington-on-Sea, Kent, on the 9th of April, 1882. Here of a truth the world's extremes are met: Amid the greyâthe moss-grown tombs of those Who led long lives obscure till came the close When, their calm days being done, their suns were setâ Here stands a grave, all monumentless yet, Wrapt like the others in a deep repose; But while yon wakeful ocean ebbs and flows It is a grave the world shall not forgetâ This grave on which meek violets grow and thyme, Summer's fair heralds; and a stranger now Pauses to see a poet's resting-place, But one of those who will in many a clime On each return of this sad day avow Fond love's regret that ne'er they saw his face. BROWNING'S FUNERAL. I. Venice, December 15th, 1889. âThe body of Robert Browning was conveyed to a gondola which had the figure of an angel at the prow and a lion at the stern, and was covered with flowers. The relations and friends followed in gondolas across the lagoon, in the light of the setting sun, to the cemetery.â Now âpast they glide,â and bear the flower-wreathed bier Across the soundless waters, cold and grey, Ere Night falls, sable-vestured and austere, And Day dies in one roseate flush away, While they who follow, tearful, in the train See wonted sights with unfamiliar eyes;â Like dreams, amid the fevered sleep of pain, Rich domes and frescoed palaces arise. Yet haply, mixed with sorrow, dawns the thought How fit such obsequies for him whose pen Hath given a wondrous poem, See Browning's poem, entitled âIn a Gondola.â passion-fraught,â Breathing of love and Venice,âunto men: And so hath added to her deathless glory A shining scroll of pure and ageless story. II. Westminster Abbey, December 31st, 1889. The music of Croft and Purcell was used âas the body was brought into Church, and for the processional parts of the burial service. This was followed by a âmeditation,â composed for the service by Dr. Bridge, the words from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's âHe giveth His belovÃ©d Sleep.ââ Croft's solemn music swells; then comes at last The dim procession through the panelled choir; And in the cloistral gloom, so still and vast, Many who loved him listen. Higher and higher Rise Purcell's dirge-like tones, Grief's very soul, Yet soon âHe giveth His belovÃ¨d Sleepâ Brings to our anguished hearts relief, control, Memories of stately Florence, and the deep Love-sacrament which bound him to his spouse Changeless through changeful years. And now in heaven They meet in blissâmeet to renew their vows Beyond the soiling touch of earthly leaven. While England, as 'tis right, in sacred trust Keeps through the centuries his hallowed dust. IN MEMORIAM, W. E. FORSTER. Obiit., April 5th, 1886. O stalwart man and pure, whose earnest face Mirrored thy fair-orbed soul, whose every deed Made answer to thy word, who gav'st no heed To selfish babble or the lust of place, Whoâgrieving at thy country's perilous case Grown dire by lack of knowledgeâin her need Cam'st with thy succourâthou whose civic creed, Too wide for party, dealt with all the race. A year hath passed since thou wast laid to rest, Yet fragrant is thy memory; thy bequest A work whose scope and grandeur Time shall gauge. Britain some dayâher daughter-lands apart No longerâwill remember thee whose heart Fired hers to win her world-wide heritage. TO A LADY PLAYING THE HARP IN HER CHAMBER. (The Countess Rosalie Von Sauerma-ZÃ¼lzendorf, niece of Spohr.) I Lady, whose conscious fingers sweep the strings With all the true musician's living power, I watch your hand, your gentle hand, which clings To that loved harp which has your touch for dower. How perfect is your skill, the fruit of yearsâ Years full of labour, years of patient thought Such tones as yours can move the heart to tears: With keen delight such tones as yours are fraught. Now while the soft notes in their sweetness rise, Now while the wave of music dies away, I seem to see the soul which lights your eyesâ The soul which lends the magic while you play. To Music's self how deep is your devotion! Your strains are not mere Artâthey are Emotion. II You told me once of that dear mother's love Whose goodness was the sunshine of your youth, Whose smile âmade paradiseâ for you, who strove To point the way to happy paths of Truth. You told me how through Life's dark days of griefâ Through all Life's dreary days of changeful careâ The thought of her fond love could bring relief, The thought of her fond love could quell despair. And now I know that in your music's sweetness, In its most subtle power to move the heart, In its true grandeur, in its rare completeness, Your mother's hallowed influence has a partâ An influence present yet and ceasing never, An influence gathering strength and beauty ever. OLD YEAR LEAVES. Tossed by the storms of Autumn chill and drear, The leaves fall auburn-tinted, and the trees Stand reft and bare, yet on the silent leas The leaves lie drifted stillâwhile cold, austere, Grim Winter waitsâwhile early snowdrops cheer The woodland shadowsâwhile the happy bees Are wakened by the balmy western breeze, And birds and boughs proclaim that Spring is here. So lost hopes severed by the stress of life Lie all unburied yet before our eyes, Though none but we regard their mute decay; And ever amid this stir and moil and strife Fresh aims and growing purposes arise Above the faded hopes of yesterday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF LOVE. THE TWO TRYSTS. Where tangled boughs of hazel cast Deep shadows on their way, A lingering youth and maiden stand As dies the summer day; Sweet is the air, and fragrant yet With many a wayside flower; Nature is joyous; yet their hearts Are sad this twilight hour. âHow shall I bear to lose you, dear,â The hapless lover cries; âNo more to see your face, nor find The love-glow in your eyes?â One kiss, one sob, and then they part, And life is bitterness, As through their tears each form beloved Grows dimly less and less. Slow pass the lagging years; and now They meetâthey meet at last, Each fairer in the other's eyes For all their sorrow past: Upon their way no shadows fall On this fair morn of June; When birds and happy bees rejoice, And all the world's in tune. THE HAWTHORN SPRAY. Happy, with that strange happiness Which Spring spreads o'er the land, I see a girl, I see a boy, They are walking hand in hand. I hear them as they gaily talk, They heed no future care, He plucks a flushing hawthorn spray To deck her fairer hair. âAnd let this be a token now,â The merry boy exclaims, âThat, some time in the coming years, We two may link our names. The may-buds are a symbol meet Of this our treaty pure, So may our compact bring us joy And evermore endure.â These twoâthough many years have fledâ Fled like a dream away, Are still as true of heart as on That unforgotten day. And so together oft again Amid the spring-tide's glow They walk, remembering thankfully Their love-pledge long ago. SPRING'S IMMORTALITY. The buds awake at touch of Spring From Winter's joyless dream; From many a stone the ouzels sing By yonder mossy stream. The cuckoo's voice, from copse and vale, Lingers, as if to meet The music of the nightingale Across the rising wheatâ The bird whom ancient Solitude Hath kept for ever young, Unaltered since in studious mood Calm Milton mused and sung. Ah, strange it is, dear heart, to know Spring's gladsome mystery Was sweet to lovers long agoâ Most sweet to such as weâ That fresh new leaves and meadow flowers Bloomed when the south wind came; While hands of Spring caressed the bowers, The throstle sang the same. Unchanged, unchanged the throstle's song, Unchanged Spring's answering breath, Unchanged, though cruel Time was strong, And stilled our love in death. A MUSICIAN'S WIFE TO HER HUSBAND. As rain each fainting flower revives Which droops at close of day, Thy music cheers my soul, and drives Its weariness away. Then play to me to-night, my love, Some sweet pathetic air, To raise my burthened soul above This woeful world of care. For when the player's heart is found Responsive to mine own, It seems as if the very sound Were sweeter in its tone. Then play to me; and make me glad; And banish all my fear, What though the world be cold and sad; Still thou, âmy life,â art here! REMONSTRANCE. (Written for Music.) 'Twas here, when last we met, you promised me That on this spot, and on a certain day, Once more we should embrace and kiss: yet see Still, still you stay. Ah, if you knew the yearning of my heart And all its grief, love, when you are away, And saw how oftentimes the tear-drops start, You would not stay. Like some faint scent of flowers borne on the air, Dispelling languor during Summer's sway, Your coming, dearest, soon dispels my careâ Then wherefore stay? Come now, my darling, come, as erst of yore,â A touch of your soft hand will make me gay, Light with your smile my dark path as before, Nor longer stay. THE BRIDE'S SONG. A few days more, a few days more, And all the world will change! For I shall enter through Love's door To something sweet yet strangeâ To that new home where comes no fear Unshared by him I loveâ And I shall always, always hear His voice where'er I rove. Ah then, ah then, my duty lies With him, and him alone, Less duty than delight, surprise, To me before unknownâ Delight that I am ever nigh To do each fond behest, Surprise that I, and only I, Can make his life more blest. Oft does he praise my sunny hair, The bloom upon my cheeksâ Would that I were indeed so fair When thus my dear one speaks. I feel myself unworthy, yet He takes me for his wife, But I will yieldâto pay my debtâ The service of my life. TO ? (A Summer Evening in the Woods.) I How lovely are the woodland glades to-night, The boughs slow moving in the balmy air, As birds sing now and then from pure delight With melody low-pitched, though scarce aware They sing. The branches, erewhile gaunt and bare, Have donned their daintiest dress; the insects keep A dreamy revel, murmuring everywhere; In these dear glades, so still, so dim, so deep, Save for these lulling sounds kind Nature seems to sleep. II The voiceless stars shine out, and all too soon The calm delicious summer twilight ends; Yet but a little space, and lo! the moon Has ris'n, and thence a flood of light descends, While she among the clouds, majestic, wends Her queen-like way; obsequious stand they near, Like courtiers round a throne; each object lends Fresh beauty to the landscape made so clear In this rare light that all its richer hues are here. III Now in this evening walk there lives anew That joyous summer evening long ago, Sweet as to-night, when first I walked with youâ When, as the westering sun was sinking low, I first knew all your love for me; and so Each year since then more swiftly than the last Has gone, for Time but made our love to grow. Yes, while the years are hurrying to the past, My one regret it is that still they fly so fast. âWHILE THE SUNSET, SLOWLY DYING.â While the sunset, slowly dying, Sheds a light o'er sea and strand, And the night-chilled breeze is sighing As the darkness wraps the landâ Come, with influence strong yet tender, Mingled thoughts of vanished years, Waking soul-thrills that can render Sometimes joy and sometimes tears. All the past, returning, seems Present with its living dreams. When the kindly summer's glory Filled the earth with myriad charms, First I breathed a lover's storyâ First I felt true love's alarmsâ First I pleaded with a maiden, Hazel-eyed, and pure, and fair As that eve whose gales love-laden Wantoned with her auburn hair. All the past, returning, seems Present with its living dreams. Now to me how swiftly thronging Come the visions of the pastâ Treasured past to me belongingâ Span of bliss too deep to last: Still do I remember clearly What I asked in trembling tone, And her words, âI love you dearly, Yours I am, and yours alone.â All the past, returning, seems Present with its living dreams. We were âwedded, happy-hearted,â And our future path seemed bright, Who could tell we should be parted, Love's glad sun obscured in night? Yet one eve, when softly sighing Summer breezes lulled the rose, I beheld her, fainting, dying, I beheld her dim eyes close. Ah, how living, fraught with woe, Rise the sights of long ago! Yet amid my sore dejection Comes the comfort ever newâ Comes the balm, the sweet reflection, To each other we were true. For some end God sendeth sorrow, When that end is gained at last, In the radiant heavenly morrow We shall meetâall sorrow past. There, no longer fraught with woe, Rise the days of long ago. THROUGH MISTS OF YEARS. Ofttimes arise through mists of years, In hours of gentle sadness, Dreams of a face once seen with tears, Whose smile was then my gladness! Like, yet unlike, the light that guides The storm-tossed o'er the ocean, Deep in my soul that face abides, Cherished with true devotion. Such moments come to soothe and bless, To touch with gleams of glory, Drawn from a by-gone happiness, Life's sometime dreary story. So well it is when lonely lies Life's pathway girt with sorrow, That this dear vision should arise, Which from the past I borrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LYRICAL AND OTHER POEMS. ON LOSING THE FRIENDSHIP OF ONE HITHERTO ESTEEMED A FRIEND. 'Twas nightfall, and sadness Around me was cast, My visions of gladness Were dreams of the pastâ As Love was forsaking Her former abode, I felt the heart-aching For joy once bestowed. I felt all the sorrowâ The pitiless voidâ When I woke on the morrow With friendship destroyed. Keen, keen was the anguish Of these weary days, When, alas! I must languish In Life's dreary maze. How weak was each token Of love given here, Shown now to be broken When friendship grew sere! In bitter bewailing I poured forth my grief, Till a new thought prevailing Brought calm and relief. Some friends are for ever, Through joy and through tears,â The friends who can never Grow cold with the years,â And when from Earth's prison My spirit ascendsâ From Death's swoon arisenâ Still, still they are friends. TO SIR WALTER SCOTT. (Written after reading his âJournal.â) Poet, 'twas no strange sun that shone on thee Through thy pure life so crowned with dignity, No sun with light now clouded, now intense, But aye the unclouded sun of common sense. THE POET'S INSPIRATION. True inspiration ever seems A joy and yet a pain, To light the poet's lofty dreams, To purify his strain. Its presence glorifies the line Whose rhythmic measure halts, Makes hackneyed thoughts seem half divine, Till few perceive such faults. And thus, although we sometimes find Imperfect cords like these In songs of many a master-mind, How seldom they displease: But when its presence is not felt, Though smooth the verses rollâ Though cadences in sweetness meltâ They cannot stir the soul. TWO LIVES. A cottage home: a peaceful place Where Sorrow hides her pallid face; Husband and wife, a happy pair, Who thankfully Life's blessings share; And living far from towns' turmoil, They simply crave a âleave to toil!â A workhouse full of dreary din, Full of the signs of want and sin. A man and woman sinking fast, Sinking, yet conscious to the last, Their senses steeped in wrathful woe None but the frugal poor can know When first, despite their care, is spent Their all through sickness and the rent; When first, despite their abject grief, No kindly landlord grants relief; When first, despite their abject gloom, His agent comesâdecrees their doom; When first within the workhouse gate Silent they stand, how desolate! When first they feel, with sorrow bowed, The loneliness amid a crowdâ When first they feel in their distress That is the deepest loneliness; When first they feel they near their end, Yet by their bed no former friend; When now, despite their strugglesâstruggles long and braveâ Their death but fillsâbut helps to fillâa pauper's grave. TO FREDERICK TENNYSON. (Died February 26th, 1898, in his ninety-first year.) Eldest of your august, poetic race, You go the last to your calm resting-place; Yet though you pass from out our earthly view, Your work remains, and Time shall give your due. Whether beneath the tranquil Tuscan skies You mused as all too soon the daylight dies; Whether you watched from your far island home The English Channel's eddying miles of foam; Or whether in your mild declining days You sojourned 'mid our clamorous London's ways; Yours was the poet's life through length of years; Yours were the poet's joys, and hopes, and fears; Yours were the tender ministries of song; Yours were the pleasures which to bards belong Who, dwelling in the world, yet âdwell apart,â And think but of their God and of their art. Our gain from lives like yours no verse can tell: Eldest of English poets, fare you well. London, February 26th, 1898. A GOLDEN WEDDING: Lines addressed to Friar Farlow Wilson on behalf of the Brotherhood of the Whitefriars, October 6th, 1899. Take this our gift which after many years Comes from a circle of your firmest friends; Remembering your true-hearted words of cheer And kindly deeds towards them, oftentimes. Yes; Life is rich whate'er the cynics say, So long as 'mid its ceaseless toil and fret Men play their parts as you do, seeking ever To show your fellow-workers sympathy. To her we owe our thanks who did not grudge To you the hours spent in our Brotherhood, Fraught with the mellow treasured memories Of many a by-gone wit whose name is dear. What matters it though callous Time has now Turned, with resistless touch, your locks to grey, If still your heart be young; and this it is We know. May all your coming days prolong For you and yours Earth's highest, choicest joy. THE PHILOSOPHY OF OUR FEELINGS. 'Tis strange that what seems grief to-day Should seem like joy to-morrow, That present bliss should pass away And seem, in future, sorrow. Yet in the web of life we find, While its vague threads we measure, The pattern of our mood of mind Traced out in pain or pleasure. THE BOY CHATTERTON TO HIMSELF. âSublime of thought, and confident of fame.â Coleridge, Monody on the Death of Chatterton. That dotard soul I cannot comprehend, Who knows no hope that, after many years His name shall be preserved by other means Than by an entry in the parish booksâ The soul who never knew the proud desire To be remembered in far days unborn By some great deed accomplished. Therefore here I make a vowâa vow unchanging, strong: I will redeem the time, and, though the days Are evil, yet it will be my delight To toil unceasingly, that at the last It shall be seen I have not lived in vain. Men's hours are passed as sacred Scripture saithâ âThey eat, they drink, are merry, and they die.â Few daily doings are of much account In fifty years; then let my mind be set On some fit theme meet for my noblest powers. THE BOY COLERIDGE TO HIMSELF. âO capacious soul!â Wordsworth, The Prelude, Book xiv. âI wonder wherefore?â is the soul-stirred cry Which wells up from the depths of human hearts In every sphere of lifeâfrom lowly homes And princely palacesâfrom hermit cells And seething crowdsâfrom youth and riper age And longest length of yearsâfrom rich and poor From all who have the manliness to thinkâ In health or sicknessâhappiness or woeâ In Life's supremest moments or its trifles Which often makes men ponder most. And this Incessant questioning is surely meant As greatest food for hopeâa token given That, notwithstanding its abyss of sin, Within man's soul the germs of good abide. Mysterious are the links that firmly weld Our trains of thought together. First we brood On some small trivial matterânow the germ Of musings somewhat loftierâthen behold A thread is woven with our thought, and lo It leads to higher themes!âvast vistas new For serious contemplation:âand we gain Sublimest heights, as God-reflected thoughts Transcending reason throng our kindled minds. PASSION'S SLAVE. Blind passion ever showed its maddening power Enthroned within himâa sin-garnered dower Of quenchless loves and longings. That fierce storm Which breaks the boughs of Life, where sheltered warm Repose, like unfledged nestlings, Life's chief joys, Swept o'er his soulâthe wave that swift destroys Man's store of peace. What years of labour cost He by one fatal step for ever lost. THE PHILOSOPHY OF FREQUENT FAILURE. In Youth's glad morning hours of strenuous life Great contemplations often fill the mind With noblest aspirations, while it seems To us, as yet scarce touched by sordid care And blighting prejudice, quite possible Through our unaided strength to win at last Some shining goal which glitters in our sightâ A goal which, when 'twas won, would crown with good The Universal Brotherhood of Man. But as the years roll on we find the dream Less easy of fulfilment,âfor we feel Our ardour less intenseâour weary feet Glide gently into that poor old-world groove We so despised of yore,âand we are fain To use fast-failing energy in strife 'Gainst daily troubles; higher aims forgotten. AT HAZELHURST. This, the loved hour of twilight's close, The landscape is revealing Haloed, where last the sunset glows, Ere Night comes, all concealing. Rich foliage hides yon rippling stream From the fair view completely; And gently, as in some kind dream, It murmurs softly, sweetly. TO EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN. Severed from you by sundering seas I dwellâ Never have clasped your hand, nor heard your voiceâ Never have seen your eyes make loving choice Of mine to tell the truths words may not tell. And yet I know youâoft in tranquil mood Your welcome songsâyour wealth of critic loreâ To me have brought a joy unfelt before,â Or letters from you cheered my solitude. January 19th, 1895. TO THE WOMEN OF GREAT BRITAIN. (A Man's Exhortation.) Song: Tune, any âeight and sixâ air. Hope on, though dark may seem the way, All will be altered soon, Changing, as changes some dark day, When sunshine comes at noon; Hope on, for hoping will impart New strength to bear the strain, The efforts of each dauntless heart Can never be in vain. Yet, hoping, cease not still to act Unchecked by gibe or jeer; With passion plead each stubborn fact, The hour of dawn is nearâ When man-made laws shall cease to vex The thinkers of our raceâ When justice is no word of sexâ As each has found its place.

      <field name="fulltext">HUMOROUS POEMS. WAITING FOR THE DENTIST. Though many dismal years I've been To dull old Care apprenticed, Of smaller woes the worst I've seen Isâwaiting for the dentist! How dreary is the cheerless room Where pain must bide his pleasure, The very chairs are steeped in gloom And seem to grieve at leisure, As if his patients' molar grief, So uncontrolled its swelling, For its fierce tide had sought relief By deluging the dwelling! Books cannot soothe a rampant tooth Though they enrich a table, Sorrow alone seems kin to truth, And joy a lying fable. When from the window you, perchance, Behold sweet girlhood's graces, They only make you look askance And think how sore your face is. On many chairs and sofas, too, More martyrs round you languish, You glance at them, they glance at you, And give a groan of anguish. You deem it hard their turn arrives Before you in rotation, Or they wax wrath that yours deprives Their case of consolation. You muse upon the ruthless wrench That buys a tooth's departing, Or how the stopping-pangs to quench, In which you may be starting; Or haply on these ivory chips Harsh Nature may deny you, But which the âgolden keyâ equips Man's genius to supply you. No words your mood of mind express, A mood devoid of quiet, Where pain, delight, and keen distress Mingle in hopeless riot. Yes, though much sorrow one must know While to old Care apprenticed, The greatest unheroic woe Isâwaiting for the dentist! APOSTROPHE TO AN INK-BOTTLE IN A HOTEL COFFEE-ROOM. 'Tis strange to think how oft your aid Has been invoked, and then To think how often you are made A confidant, and when. Prosaic words of business life By you have been expressed; And you have told what fears were rife Within a lover's breast. Perchance a little girl or boy Released from schoolday fetters, Intent on games, and flushed with joy, Employs you for home letters. A husband forced, though leal and true, In some new land to dwell, To his dear wife indites by you A passionate farewell. There enters now a seeming âswell,â Eager, yet half afraid, he Impresses you for a âbillet douxâ On business rather âshady.â âCommercialsâ pen a dazzling dream Of greatly grown âconnectionâ; And next you aid the swelling stream Of filial affection Which flows in sorrow, as a son, From his fond mother parted, Grieves that his course, alas, has run So far from whence it started. Helper of all! from day to day, What'er their situation, You win no thanks; each goes away, Feeling no obligation! MOONLIGHT ON THE TAGUS. The moon shines o'er the Tagus. Now a flood Of soft-spun sparkling radiance clothes the scene With dazzling splendour, save where shadows lie Upon the river's bosom, sheltering there The coward Darkness, here dethroned awhile, By the moon's great though seeming gentle might. Ah me, how beautiful! Deep azure sky, Deep azure sea, and steadfast-beaming stars,â A dreamy blissful languor stealeth fast Over my soul while musing pensively On this fair vista steeped in rapt repose, And I forget the busy throng of life That it presents by day,âand almost now I could imagine it some magic realm Enchanted in far fairyland, beyond The power of mortal reach. But soon a voice Says, âSupper's come at last, let's eat, and then to bed.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS FOR SCHOOL RECITATION. Standards I. and II. LITTLE AMY TO HER FLOWERS. I.âTo the Violet. I love you, little violet, Your beauty I shall not forget; You smell so sweet, you are so blue, Under the hedge the springtime through. II.âTo the Daffodils. You pretty little daffodils Beside the budding trees; I love to watch your yellow heads A-nodding in the breeze. I love to touch with tenderness Or smell all springtide flowers, But most I love you, daffodils, A-stir in sunny hours. III.âTo a Drooping Plant. Drooping plant, your pretty flower Wants the sunshine, wants the shower, And the happy, balmy day Of the summer, passed away. Do you dread the wintry blast Whirling round you, fierce and fast, And the snow-drift, cruel, cold, Gathering now upon the wold? Do you dread the frosty night, Bringing with it bitter blight, Like a giant holding all Captive in his icy thrall? Yet dream not that Hope is past Winter will not always last; Soon his dreary reign will close, Soon comes Spring to end your woes. Soon will come the gentle breeze Whispering softly through the trees, And the happy lengthening day Making all the gardens gay. LITTLE BERTIE. (His Mother Speaks). I. Rest you in quiet now, my baby boy, You are in truth your parents' highest joy;â For though our home has ever been a place Where Happiness has deigned to show her face, Yet still your birth increased its bliss much more, And filled a void there was in it before. O may your life continue ever free From taint of shame, whate'er your lot may be: As spotless as the snow-drops oft appear When first they come to tell us Spring is near: Such is my wish for you, my jewel prized; May I yet live to see it realized. II. Your mother's love is tender, true, and kind, From all the dross of selfishness refined; In childhood's years it is a tender guide To keep you safe from harm on every side; And when your childhood's cherished days are passed, 'Twill help you to endure the world's rough blast. Her love abides; hallowed by memory still, Through joy or sorrow, happiness or ill; And, like some flower, growth of a holier sphere, To gladden earth awhile, transplanted here, 'Twill shed its fragrance still o'er all your ways And cheer your drooping heart in life's dark days.</field>
