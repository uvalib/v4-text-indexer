      <field name="fulltext">A SERIES OF PLAYS: IN WHICH IT IS ATTEMPTED TO DELINEATE THE STRONGER PASSIONS OF THE MIND EACH PASSION BEING THE SUBJECT OF A TRAGEDY AND A COMEDY. BASIL: A TRAGEDY. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Count Basil, a general in the Emperor's service. Count Rosinberg, his friend. Duke of Mantua. Gauriecio, his minister. Valtomer, officer of Basil's troops. Frederic, officer of Basil's troops. Geoffry, an old soldier very much maimed in the wars. Mirando, a little boy, a favourite of Victoria.WOMEN Victoria, daughter to the Duke of Mantua. Countess of Albini, friend and governess to Victoria. Isabella, a lady attending upon Victoria. Officers, soldiers, and attendants, masks, dancers, &amp;c The Scene is in Mantua, and its environs. Time supposed to be the sixteenth century, when Charles the Fifth defeated Francis the First, at the battle of Pavia. ACT I. SCENE I. An open street, crowded with people, who seem to be waiting in expectation of some show. Enter a Citizen. First Man. Well, friend, what tidings of the grand procession? Cit. I left it passing by the northern gate. Second Man. I've waited long, I'm glad it comes at last. Young Man. And does the princess look so wondrous fair As fame reports? Cit. She is the fairest lady of the train,â Yet all the fairest beauties of the court Are in her train. Old Man. Bears she such off'rings to Saint Francis' shrine, So rich, so marvellous rich, as rumour says? â'Twill drain the treasury! Cit. Since she, in all this splendid pomp returns Her public thanks to the good patron Saint, Who from his sick bed hath restor'd her father, Thou wouldst not have her go with empty hands? She loves magnificence.â [Discovering amongst the crowd old Geoffry. Ha! art thou here, old remnant of the wars? Thou art not come to see this courtly show, Which sets the young agape? Geof. I came not for the show; and yet, methinks, It were a better jest upon me still, If thou didst truly know my errand here. Cit. I pri'thee say. Geof. What, must I tell it thee? As o'er my evening fire I musing sat, Some few days since, my mind's eye backward turn'd Upon the various changes I have pass'dâ How in my youth with gay attire allur'd, And all the grand accountrements of war, I left my peaceful home: then my first battles, When clashing arms, and sights of blood were new: Then all the after chances of the war: Ay, and that field, a well-fought field it was, When with an arm (I speak not of it oft) Which now (pointing to his empty sleeve) thou seest is no arm of mine, In a strait pass I stopp'd a thousand foes, And turn'd my flying comrades to the charge; For which good service, in his tented court, My prince bestow'd a mark of favour on me; While his fair consort, seated by his side, The fairest lady e'er mine eyes beheld, Gave me what more than all besides I priz'd,â Methinks I see her still â a gracious smile â 'Twas a heart-kindling smile, â a smile of praise â Well, musing thus on all my fortunes past, A neighbour drew the latchet of my door, And full of news from town, in many words Big with rich names, told of this grand procession; E'en as he spoke a fancy seiz'd my soul To see the princess pass, if in her looks I yet might trace some semblance of her mother. This is the simple truth; laugh as thou wilt. I came not for the show. Enter an Officer. Officer to Geof. Make way that the procession may have room: Stand you aside, and let this man have place. [Pushing Geof. and endeavouring to put another in his place. Geof. But that thou art the prince's officer, I'd give thee back thy push with better blows. Officer. What, wilt thou not give place? the prince is near: I will complain to him, and have thee caged. Geof. Yes, do complain, I pray; and when thou dost, Say that the private of the tenth brigade, Who sav'd his army on the Danube's bank, And since that time a private hath remain'd, Dares, as a citizen, his right maintain Against thy insolence. Go tell him this, And ask him then what dungeon of his tower He'll have me thrust into. Cit. to Officer. This is old Geoffry of the tenth brigade. Offi. I knew him not: you should have told me sooner. [Exit, looking much ashamed. Martial music heard at a distance. Cit. Hark, this is music of a warlike kind. Enter second Citizen. To Sec. Cit. What sounds are these, good friend, which this way bear? Sec. Cit. The brave Count Basil is upon his march, To join the emperor with some chosen troops, And doth as our ally through Mantua pass. Geof. I've heard a good report of this young soldier. Sec. Cit. 'Tis said he disciplines his men severely And over-much affects the old commander, Which seems ungracious in so young a man. Geof. I know he loves not ease and revelry; He makes them soldiers at no dearer rate Than he himself hath paid. What, dost thou think, That e'en the very meanest simple craft Cannot without due diligence be learn'd, And yet the nobler art of soldiership May be attained by loit'ring in the sun? Some men are born to feast and not to fight: Whose sluggish minds, e'en in fair honour's field Still on their dinner turn â Let such pot-boiling varlets stay at home, And wield a flesh-hook rather than a sword. In times of easy service, true it is, An easy careless chief, all soldiers love; But O how gladly in the day of battle Would they their jolly bottle-chief desert, And follow such a leader as Count Basil! So gath'ring herds, at pressing danger's call, Confess the master deer. [Music is heard again, and nearer. Geof. walks up and down with a military triumphant step. Cit. What moves thee thus? Geof. I've march'd to this same tune in glorious days. My very limbs catch motion from the sound, As they were young again. Sec. Cit. But here they come. Enter Count Basil, officers and soldiers in procession, with colours flying, and martial music. When they have marched half-way over the stage, an officer of the duke's enters from the opposite side, and speaks to Basil, upon which he gives a sign with his hand, and the martial music ceases; soft music is heard at a little distance, and Victoria, with a long procession of ladies, enters from the opposite side. The General &amp;c. pay obeisance to her, as she passes; she stops to return it, and then goes off with her train. After which the military procession moves on, and Exeunt. Cit. to Geof. What thinkst thou of the princess? Geof. She is fair, But not so fair as her good mother was. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A public walk on the ramparts of the town. Enter Count Rosinberg, Valtomer, and Frederic. âValtomer enters by the opposite side of the stage, and meets them. Valt. O what a jolly town for way-worn soldiers! Rich steaming pots, and smell of dainty fare, From every house salute you as you pass: Light feats and juggler's tricks attract the eye; Music and merriment in ev'ry street; Whilst pretty damsels in their best attire, Trip on in wanton groups, then look behind, To spy the fools a-gazing after them. Fred. But short will be the season of our ease, For Basil is of flinty matter made, And cannot be allur'd â 'Faith, Rosinberg, I would thou didst command us. Thou art his kinsman, of a rank as noble, Some years his elder too â How has it been That he should be prefer'd? I see not why. Ros. Ah! but I see it, and allow it well; He is too much my pride to wake my envy. Fred. Nay, Count, it is thy foolish admiration Which raises him to such superior height; And truly thou hast so infected us, That I at times have felt me aw'd before him, I knew not why. 'Tis cursed folly this. Thou art as brave, of as good parts as he. Ros. Our talents of a diff'rent nature are; Mine for the daily intercourse of life, And his for higher things. Fred. Well, praise him as thou wilt; I see it not; I'm sure I am as brave a man as he. Ros. Yes, brave thou art, but 'tis subaltern brav'ry, And doth respect thyself. Thou'lt bleed as well, Give and receive as deep a wound as he. When Basil fights he wields a thousand swords; For 'tis their trust in his unshaken mind, O'erwatching all the changes of the field, Calm and inventive 'midst the battle's storm, Which makes his soldiers bold.â There have been those, in early manhood slain, Whose great heroic souls have yet inspir'd With such a noble zeal their gen'rous troops, That to their latest day of bearing arms, Their grey-hair'd soldiers have all dangers brav'd Of desp'rate service, claim'd with boastful pride, As those who fought beneath them in their youth. Such men have been; of whom it may be said, Their spirits conquer'd when their clay was cold. Valt. Yes, I have seen in the eventful field, When new occasion mock'd all rules of art, E'en old commanders hold experience cheap, And look to Basil ere his chin was dark. Ros. One fault he has; I know but only one; His too great love of military fame Absorbs his thoughts, and makes him oft appear Unsocial and severe. Fred. Well, feel I not undaunted in the field? As much enthusiastic love of glory? Why am I not as good a man as he? Ros. He's form'd for great occasions, thou for small. Valt. But small occasions in the path of life Lie thickly sown, while great are rarely scatter'd. Ros. By which you would infer that men like Fred'ric Should on the whole a better figure make, Than men of higher parts. It is not so; For some show well, and fair applauses gain, Where want of skill in other men is graceful. Pray do not frown, good Fred'ric, no offence: Thou canst not make a great man of thyself; Yet wisely deign to use thy native pow'rs, And prove an honour'd courtly gentleman. But hush! no more of this; here Basil comes. Enter Basil, who returns their salute without speaking. Ros. What thinkst thou, Valtomer, of Mantua's princess? Valt. Fame prais'd her much, but hath not prais'd her more Than on a better proof the eye consents to. With all that grace and nobleness of mien, She might do honour to an emp'ror's throne; She is too noble for a petty court. Is it not so, my lord? â (To Basil, who only bows assent). Nay, she demeans herself with so much grace, Such easy state, such gay magnificence, She should be queen of revelry and show. Fred. She's charming as the goddess of delight. Valt. But after her, she most attracted me Who wore the yellow scarf and walk'd the last; For, though Victoria is a lovely woman â Fred. Nay, it is treason but to call her woman; She's a divinity, and should be worshipp'd. But on my life, since now we talk of worship, She worshipp'd Francis with right noble gifts! They sparkled so with gold and precious gemsâ Their value must be great; some thousand crowns. Ros. I would not rate them at a price so mean; The cup alone, with precious stones beset, Would fetch a sum as great. That olive-branch The princess bore herself, of fretted gold, Was exquisitely wrought. I mark'd it more, Because she held it in so white a hand. Bas. (in a quick voice). Mark'd you her hand? I did not see her hand. And yet she wav'd it twice. Ros. It is a fair one, tho' you mark'd it not. Valt. I wish some painter's eye had view'd the group, As she and all her lovely damsels pass'd; He would have found wherewith t'enrich his art. Ros. I wish so too; for oft their fancied beauties Have so much cold perfection in their parts, 'Tis plain they ne'er belong'd to flesh and blood. This is not truth, and doth not please so well As the varieties of lib'ral nature, Where ev'ry kind of beauty charms the eye; Large and small featur'd, flat and prominent, Ay, by the mass! and snub-nos'd beauties too. 'Faith, ev'ry woman hath some witching charm, If that she be not proud, or captious. Valt. Demure, or over-wise, or giv'n to freaks. Ros. Or giv'n to freaks! hold, hold, good Valtomer! Thou'lt leave no woman handsome under heav'n. Valt. But I must leave you for an hour or so; I mean to view the town. Fred. I'll go with thee. Ros. And so will I. [Exeunt Valtomer, Frederic, and Rosinberg. Re-enter Rosinberg. Ros. I have repented me, I will not go; They will be too long absent. â (Pauses, and looks at Basil, who remains still musing without seeing him). What mighty thoughts engage my pensive friend? Bas. O it is admirable! Ros. How runs thy fancy? what is admirable? Bas. Her form, her face, her motion, ev'rything! Ros. The princess; yes, have we not prais'd her much? Bas. I know you prais'd her, and her off'rings too! She might have giv'n the treasures of the East, Ere I had known it. O! didst thou mark her when she first appear'd, Still distant, slowly moving with her train; Her robe and tresses floating on the wind, Like some light figure in a morning cloud? Then, as she onward to the eye became The more distinct, how lovelier still she grew! That graceful bearing of her slender form; Her roundly spreading breast, her tow'ring neck, Her face ting'd sweetly with the bloom of youthâ But when approaching near, she tow'rds us turn'd, Kind mercy! what a countenance was there! And when to our salute she gently bow'd, Didst mark that smile rise from her parting lips? Soft swell'd her glowing cheek, her eyes smil'd too, O how they smil'd! 'twas like the beams of heav'n! I felt my roused soul within me start, Like something wak'd from sleep. Ros. The beams of heav'n do many slumb'rers wake To care and misery! Bas. There's something grave and solemn in your voice. As you pronounce these words. What dost thou mean? Thou wouldst not sound my knell? Ros. No, not for all beneath the vaulted sky! But to be plain, thus warmly from your lips, Her praise displeases me. To men like you, If love should come, he proves no easy guest. Bas. What, dost thou think 1 am beside myself, And cannot view the fairness of perfection With that delight which lovely beauty gives, Without tormenting me by fruitless wishes, Like the poor child who sees its brighten'd face, And whimpers for the moon! Thou art not serious. From early youth, war has my mistress been, And tho' a rugged one, I'll constant prove, And not forsake her now. There may be joys Which, to the strange o'erwhelming of the soul, Visit the lover's breast beyond all others; E'en now, how dearly do I feel there may! But what of them? they are not made for meâ The hasty flashes of contending steel Must serve instead of glances from my love, And for soft breathing sighs the cannon's roar. Ros. (taking his hand). Now am I satisfied. Forgive me, Basil. Bas. I'm glad thou art; we'll talk of her no more; Why should I vex my friend? Ros. Thou hast not issued orders for the march. Bas. I'll do it soon; thou needst not be afraid. To-morrow's sun shall bear us far from hence, Never perhaps to pass these gates again. Ros. With last night's close, did you not curse this town That would one single day your troops retard: And now, methinks, you talk of leaving it, As though it were the place that gave you birth; As though you had around these strangers' walls Your infant gambols play'd. Bas. The sight of what may be but little priz'd, Doth cause a solemn sadness in the mind, When view'd as that we ne'er shall see again. Ros. No, not a whit to wandering men like us. No, not a whit! What custom hath endear'd We part with sadly, though we prize it not: But what is new some powerful charm must own, Thus to affect the mind. Bas. (hastily). We'll let it pass â It hath no consequence: Thou art impatient. Ros. I'm not impatient. 'Faith, I only wish Some other route our destin'd march had been, That still thou mightst thy glorious course pursue With an untroubled mind. Bas. O! wish it, wish it not! bless'd be that route! What we have seen to-day, I must remember â I should be brutish if I could forget it. Oft in the watchful post, or weary march, Oft in the nightly silence of my tent, My fixed mind shall gaze upon it still; But it will pass before my fancy's eye, Like some delightful vision of the soul, To soothe, not trouble it. Ros. What! 'midst the dangers of eventful war, Still let thy mind be haunted by a woman? Who would, perhaps, hear of thy fall in battle, As Dutchmen read of earthquakes in Calabria, And never stop to cry âalack a-day!â For me there is but one of all the sex, Who still shall hold her station in my breast, 'Midst all the changes of inconstant fortune; Because I'm passing sure she loves me well, And for my sake a sleepless pillow finds When rumour tells bad tidings of the war; Because I know her love will never change, Nor make me prove uneasy jealousy. Bas. Happy art thou! who is this wondrous woman? Ros. It is my own good mother, faith and truth? Bas. (smiling). Give me thy hand; I love her dearly too. Rivals we are not, though our love is one. Ros. And yet I might be jealous of her love, For she bestows too much of it on thee, Who hast no claim but to a nephew's share. Bas. (going). I'll meet thee some time hence. I must to court. Ros. A private conference will not stay thee long. I'll wait thy coming near the palace gate. Bas. 'Tis to the public court I mean to go. Ros. I thought you had determin'd otherwise. Bas. Yes, but on further thought it did appear As though it would be failing in respect At such a time â That look doth wrong me, Rosinberg! For on my life, I had determin'd thus, Ere I beheld â Before we enter'd Mantua. But wilt thou change that soldier's dusty garb, And go with me thyself? Ros. Yes, I will go. [As they are going Ros. stops and looks at Basil. Bas. Why dost thou stop? Ros. 'Tis for my wonted caution, Which first thou gav'st me â I shall ne'er forget it! 'Twas at Vienna, on a public-day; Thou but a youth, I then a man full form'd; Thy stripling's brow grac'd with its first cockade, Thy mighty bosom swell'd with mighty thoughts. Thou'rt for the court, dear Rosinberg, quoth thou! âNow pray thee be not caught with some gay dame, To laugh and ogle, and befool thyself: It is offensive in the public eye, And suits not with a man of thy endowments.â So said your serious lordship to me, then, And have on like occasions, often since, In other terms repeated. â But I must go to-day without my caution. Bas. Nay, Rosinberg, I am impatient now: Did I not say we'd talk of her no more? Ros. Well, my good friend, God grant we keep our word! (Exeunt). Note. â My first idea when I wrote this play was to represent Basil as having seen Victoria for the first time in the procession, that I might show more perfectly the passion from its first beginning, and also its sudden power over the mind; but I was induced, from the criticism of one whose judgment I very much respect, to alter it, and represent him as having formerly seen and loved her. The first Review that took notice of this work objected to Basil's having seen her before as a defect; and, as we are all easily determined to follow our own opinion, I have, upon after-consideration, given the play in this edition [third], as far as this is concerned, exactly in its original state. Strong internal evidence of this will be discovered by any one who will take the trouble of reading attentively the second scenes of the first and second acts in the present and former editions of this book. Had Basil seen and loved Victoria before, his first speech, in which he describes her to Rosinberg as walking in the procession, would not be natural; and there are, I think, other little things besides, which will show that the circumstance of his former meeting with her is an interpolation. The blame of this, however, I take entirely upon myself; the critic, whose opinion I have mentioned, judged of the piece entirely as an unconnected play, and knew nothing of the general plan of this work, which ought to have been communicated to him. Had it been, indeed, an unconnected play, and had I put this additional circumstance to it with proper judgment and skill, I am inclined to think it would have been an improvement. ACT II. SCENE I. A room of state. The Duke of Mantua, Basil Rosinberg, and a number of Courtiers, Attendants, &amp;c. The Duke and Basil appear talking together on the front of the stage. Duke. But our opinions differ widely there; From the position of the rival armies, I cannot think they'll join in battle soon. Bas. I am indeed beholden to your highness, But though unwillingly, we must depart. The foes are near, the time is critical; A soldier's reputation is too fine, To be expos'd e'en to the smallest cloud. Duke. An untried soldier's is; but yours, my lord, Nurs'd with the bloody show'rs of many a field, And brightest sunshine of successful fortune, A plant of such a hardy stem hath grown, E'en envy's sharpest blasts assail it not. Yet after all, by the bless'd holy Cross! I feel too warm an interest in the cause To stay your progress here a single hour, Did I not know your soldiers are fatigu'd, And two days' rest would much recruit their strenght. Bas. Your highness will be pleas'd to pardon me; My troops are not o'ermarch'd, and one day's rest Is all our needs require. Duke. Ah! hadst thou come Unfetter'd with the duties of command, I then had well retain'd thee for my guest, With claims too strong, too sacred for denial. Thy noble sire my fellow-soldier was; Together many a rough campaign we serv'd; I lov'd him well, and much it pleases me A son of his beneath my roof to see. Bas. Were I indeed free master of myself, Strong inclination would detain me here; No other tie were wanting. These gracious tokens of your princely favour I'll treasure with my best remembrances; For he who shows them for my father's sake, Does something sacred in his kindness bear, As though he shed a blessing on my head. Duke. Well, bear my greetings to the brave Pescara, And say how warmly I embrace the cause. Your third day's march will to his presence bring Your valiant troops: said you not so, my lord? Enter Victoria, the Countess of Albini, Isabella, and Ladies. Bas. (who changes countenance upon seeing them). Yes, I believe â I think â I know not wellâ Yes, please your grace, we march by break of day. Duke. Nay, that I know. I ask'd you, noble count, When you expect to join th' imperial force. Bas. When it shall please your graceâI crave your pardonâ I somewhat have mistaken of your words. Duke. You are not well? your colour changes, count. What is the matter? Bas. A dizzy mist that swims before my sightâ A ringing in my earsâ'tis strange enoughâ 'Tis slight â 'tis nothing worth â 'tis gone already. Duke. I'm glad it is. Look to your friend, Count Rosinberg, It may return again â (To Rosinberg, who stands at a little distance, looking earnestly at Basil â Duke leaves them and joins Victoria 's party). Ros. Good heavens, Basil, is it thus with thee! Thy hand shakes too: (taking his hand). Would we were far from hence! Bas. I'm well again, thou needst not be afraid. 'Tis like enough my frame is indispos'd With some slight weakness from our weary march. Nay, look not on me thus, it is unkindlyâ I cannot bear thine eyes. The Duke, with Victoria and her ladies, advances to the front of the stage to Basil. Duke. Victoria, welcome here the brave Count Basil; His kinsman too, the gallant Rosinberg. May you, and these fair ladies so prevail, Such gentle suitors cannot plead in vain, To make them grace my court another day. I shall not be offended when I see Your power surpasses mine. Vict. Our feeble efforts will presumptuous seem, Attempting that in which your highness fails. Duke. There's honour in th' attempt; success attend ye! â (Duke retires, and mixes with the courtiers at the bottom of the stage). Vict. I fear we incommoded you, my lord, With the slow tedious length of our procession. E'en as I pass'd, it went against my heart, To stop so long upon their tedious way Your weary troops.â Bas. Ah! madam, all too short! Time never bears such moments on his wing, But when he flies too swiftly to be mark'd. Vict. Ah! surely then you make too good amends By marking now his after-progress well. To-day must seem a weary length to him Who is so eager to be gone to-morrow. Ros. They must not linger who would quit these walls; For if they do, a thousand masked foes; Some under show of rich luxurious feasts, Gay, sprightly pastime, and high-zested game;â Nay, some, my gentle ladies, true it is, The very worst and fellest of the crew, In fair alluring shape of beauteous dames, Do such a barrier form t' oppose their way, As few men may o'ercome. Isab. From this last wicked foe should we infer Yourself have suffer'd much? Albin. No, Isabella, these are common words, To please you with false notions of your pow'r. So all men talk of ladies and of love. Vict. 'Tis even so. If Love a tyrant be, How dare his humble chained votaries To tell such rude and wicked tales of him? Bas. Because they most of lover's ills complain, Who but affect it as a courtly grace, Whilst he who feels is silent. Ros. But there you wrong me; I have felt it oft. Oft has it made me sigh at ladies' feet, Soft ditties sing, and dismal sonnets scrawl. Albin. In all its strange effects, most worthy Rosinberg, Has it e'er made thee in a corner sit, Sad, lonely, moping sit, and hold thy tongue? Ros. No, 'faith, it never has. Albin. Ha, ha, ha, ha! then thou hast never lov'd. Ros. Nay, but I have, and felt love's bondage too. Vict. Fye! it is pedantry to call it bondage! Love-marring wisdom, reason full of bars, Deserve, methinks, that appellation more. Is it not so, my lord? â (To Basil.) Bas. O surely, madam! That is not bondage which the soul enthrall'd So gladly bears, and quits not but with anguish. Stern honour's laws, the fair report of men, These are the fetters that enchain the mind, But such as must not, cannot be unloos'd. Vict. No, not unloos'd, but yet one day relax'd, To grant a lady's suit unus'd to sue. Ros. Your highness deals severely with us now, And proves indeed our freedom is but small, Who are constrain'd, when such a lady sues, To say it cannot be. Vict. It cannot be! Count Basil says not so. Ros. For that I am his friend, to save him pain I take th' ungracious office on myself. Vict. How ill thy face is suited to thine office! Ros. (smiling). Would I could suit mine office to my face, If that would please your highness. Vict. No, you are obstinate and perverse all, And would not grant it if you had the pow'r. Albini, I'll retire; come, Isabella. Bas. (aside to Ros.) Ah, Rosinberg! thou hast too far presum'd; She is offended with us. Ros. No, she is notâ What dost thou fear? be firm, and let us go. Vict. (pointing to a door leading to other apartments, by which she is ready to go out). These are apartments strangers love to see: Some famous paintings do their walls adorn: They lead you also to the palace court As quickly as the way by which you came. [Exit Vict. led out by Ros., and followed by Isab. Bas. (aside, looking after them). O! what a fool am I! where fled my thoughts? I might as well as he, now, by her side, Have held her precious hand enclos'd in mine. As well as he, who cares not for it neither. O but he does! that were impossible! Albin. You stay behind, my lord. Bas. Your pardon, madam; honour me so far â [Exeunt, Basil handing out Albini. SCENE II. A gallery hung with pictures. Victoria discovered in conversation with Rosinberg, Basil, Albini, and Isabella. Vict. (to Ros.) It is indeed a work of wondrous art. (To Isab.) You call'd Francisco here? Isab. He comes even now. Enter Attendant. Vict. (to Ros.) He will conduct you to the northern gall'ry; Its striking shades will call upon the eye, To point its place there needs no other guide. [Exeunt Ros. and Attendant. (To Bas.) Loves not Count Basil too this charming art? It is an ancient painting much admir'd. Bas. Ah! do not banish me these few short moments: Too soon they will be gone! for ever gone! Vict. If they are precious to you, say not so, But add to them another precious day. A lady asks it. Bas. Ah, madam! ask the life-blood from my heart! Ask all but what a soldier may not give. Vict. 'Tis ever thus when favours are denied; All had been granted but the thing we beg; And still some great unlikely substitute, Your life, your soul, your all of earthly good, Is proffer'd in the room of one small boon. So keep your life-blood, gen'rous, valiant lord, And may it long your noble heart enrich, Until I wish it shed. (Bas. attempts to speak). Nay, frame no new excuse; I will not hear it. [She puts out her hand as if she would shut his mouth, but at a distance from it; Bas. runs eagerly up to her, and presses it to his lips. Bas. Let this sweet hand indeed its threat perform, And make it heav'n to be for ever dumb! (Vict. looks stately and offended â Basil kneels.) O pardon me! I know not what I do. Frown not, reduce me not to wretchedness; But only grant â Vict. What should I grant to him, Who has so oft my earnest suit denied? Vict. (raising him). Well, Basil, this good promise is thy pardon. I will not wait your noble friend's return, Since we shall meet again.â You will perform your word? Bas. I will perform it. Vict. Farewell, my lord. [Exit, with her ladies. Bas. (alone). âFarewell, my lord.â O! what delightful sweetness! The music of that voice dwells on the ear! âFarewell, my lord!ââAy, and then look'd she soâ The slightest glance of her bewitching eye, Those dark blue eyes, commands the inmost soul. Well, there is yet one day of life before me, And, whatsoe'er betide, I will enjoy it. Though but a partial sunshine in my lot, I will converse with her, gaze on her still, If all behind were pain and misery. Pain! Were it not the easing of all pain, E'en in the dismal gloom of after years, Such dear remembrance on the mind to wear, Like silv'ry moon-beams on the 'nighted deep, When heav'n's blest sun is gone? Kind mercy! how my heart within me beat When she so sweetly pled the cause of love! Can she have lov'd? why shrink I at the thought? Why should she not? no, no, it cannot beâ No man on earth is worthy of her love. Ah! if she could, how blest a man were he! Where rove my giddy thoughts? it must not be. Yet might she well some gentle kindness bear; Think of him oft, his absent fate inquire, And, should he fall in battle, mourn his fall. Yes, she would mourn â such love might she bestow; And poor of soul the man who would exchange it For warmest love of the most loving dame! But here comes Rosinberg â have I done well? He will not say I have. Enter Rosinberg. Ros. Where is the princess? I'm sorry I return'd not ere she went. Bas. You'll see her still. Ros. What, comes she forth again? Bas. She does to-morrow. Ros. Thou hast yielded then. Bas. Come, Rosinberg, I'll tell thee as we go: It was impossible I should not yield. Ros. O Basil! thou art weaker than a child. Bas. Yes, yes, my friend, but 'tis a noble weakness, A weakness which hath greater things achiev'd Than all the firm determin'd strength of reason. By heav'n! I feel a new-born pow'r within me, Shall make me twenty-fold the man I've been Before this fated day. Ros. Fated indeed! but an ill-fated day, That makes thee other than thy former self. Yet let it work its will; it cannot change thee To aught I shall not love. Bas. Thanks, Rosinberg! thou art a noble heart. I would not be the man thou couldst not love For an imperial crown. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A small apartment in the palace. Enter Duke and Gauriecio. Duke. The point is gain'd; my daughter is successful; And Basil is detain'd another day. Gaur. But does the princess know your secret aim? Duke. No, that had marr'd the whole; she is a womanâ Her mind, as suits the sex, too weak and narrow To relish deep-laid schemes of policy. Besides, so far unlike a child of mine, She holds its subtle arts in high derision, And will not serve us but with bandag'd eyes. Gauriecio, could I trusty servants find, Experienc'd, crafty, close, and unrestrain'd By silly superstitious child-learnt fears, What might I not effect? Gaur. O any thing! The deep and piercing genius of your highness, So ably serv'd, might e'en achieve the empire. Duke. No, no, my friend, thou dost o'erprize my parts; Yet mighty things might beâdeep subtle wits, In truth, are master spirits in the world. The brave man's courage, and the student's lore, Are but as tools his secret ends to work, Who hath the skill to use them. This brave Count Basil, dost thou know him well? Much have we gain'd, but for a single day, At such a time, to hold his troops detain'd; When, by that secret message of our spy, The rival pow'rs are on the brink of action: But might we more effect? Knowst thou this Basil? Might he be tamper'd with? Gaur. That were most dang'rous.â He is a man, whose sense of right and wrong To such a high romantic pitch is wound, And all so hot and fiery in his nature, The slightest hint, as though you did suppose Baseness and treach'ry in him, so he'll deem it, Would be to rouse a flame that might destroy. Duke. But int'rest, int'rest, man's all-ruling pow'r, Will tame the hottest spirit to your service, And skilfully applied, mean service too; E'en as there is an element in nature Which, when subdu'd, will on your hearth fulfil The lowest uses of domestic wants. Gaur. Earth-kindled fire, which from a little spark, On hidden fuel feeds its growing strength, Till o'er the lofty fabric it aspires And rages out its pow'r, may be subdu'd, And in your base domestic service bound; But who would madly in its wild career The fire of heav'n arrest to boil his pot? No, Basil will not serve your secret schemes, Though you had all to give ambition strives for. We must beware of him. Duke. His father was my friend, â I wish'd to gain him: But since fantastic fancies bind him thus, The sin be on his head; I stand acquitted, And must deceive him, even to his ruin. Gaur. I have prepar'd Bernardo for your service; To-night he will depart for th' Austrain camp, And should he find them on the eve of battle, I've bid him wait the issue of the field. If that our secret friends victorious prove, With the arrow's speed he will return again: But should fair Fortune crown Pescara's arms, Then shall your soothing message greet his ears; For till our friends some sound advantage gain, Our actions still must wear an Austrian face. Duke. Well hast thou school'd him. Didst thou add withal, That 'tis my will he garnish well his speech, With honied words of the most dear regard, And friendly love I bear him? This is needful; And lest my slowness in the promis'd aid Awake suspicion, bid him e'en rehearse The many favours on my house bestow'd By his imperial master, as a theme On which my gratitude delights to dwell. Gaur. I have, an' please your highness. Duke. Then 'tis well. Gaur. But for the yielding up that little fort There could be no suspicion. Duke. My Governor I have severely punish'd, As a most daring traitor to my orders. He cannot from his darksome dungeon tell; Why then should they suspect? Gaur. He must not live, should Charles prove victorious. Duke. He's done me service; say not so, Gauriecio. Gaur. A traitor's name he will not calmly bear; He'll tell his tale aloud â he must not live. Duke. Well, if it must â we'll talk of this again. Gaur. But while with anxious care and crafty wiles You would enlarge the limits of your state, Your highness must beware lest inward broils Bring danger near at hand: your northern subjects E'en now are discontented and unquiet. Duke. What, dare the ungrateful miscreants thus return The many favours of my princely grace? 'Tis ever thus; indulgence spoils the base; Raising up pride, and lawless turbulence, Like noxious vapours from the fulsome marsh When morning shines upon it.â Did I not lately with parental care, When dire invaders their destruction threaten'd, Provide them all with means of their defence? Did I not, as a mark of gracious trust, A body of their vagrant youth select To guard my sacred person? till that day An honour never yet allow'd their race. Did I not suffer them, upon their suit, T' establish manufactures in their towns? And after all some chosen soldiers spare To guard the blessings of interior peace? Gaur. Nay, please your highness, they do well allow, That when your enemies, in fell revenge, Your former inroads threaten'd to repay, Their ancient arms you did to them restore, With kind permission to defend themselves: That so far have they felt your princely grace, In drafting from their fields their goodliest youth To be your servants: that you did vouchsafe, On paying of a large and heavy fine, Leave to apply the labour of their hands As best might profit to the country's weal: And to encourage well their infant trade, Quarter'd your troops upon them. â Please your grace, All this they do most readily allow. Duke. They do allow it, then, ungrateful varlets! What would they have? what would they have, Gauriecio? Gaur. Some mitigation of their grievous burdens, Which, like an iron weight around their necks, Do bend their care-worn faces to the earth, Like creatures form'd upon its soil to creep, Not stand erect and view the sun of heav'n. Duke. But they beyond their proper sphere would rise; Let them their lot fulfil as we do ours. Society of various parts is form'd; They are its grounds, its mud, its sediment, And we the mantling top which crowns the whole. Calm, steady labour is their greatest bliss; To aim at higher things beseems them not. To let them work in peace my care shall be; To slacken labour is to nourish pride. Methinks thou art a pleader for these fools: What may this mean, Gauriecio? Gaur. They were resolv'd to lay their cause before you, And would have found some other advocate Less pleasing to your Grace, had I refus'd Duke. Well, let them know, some more convenient season I'll think of this, and do for them as much As suits the honour of my princely state. Their prince's honour should be ever dear To worthy subjects as their precious lives. Gaur. I fear, unless you give some special promise, They will be violent still â Duke. Then do it, if the wretches are so bold, We can retract it when the times allow; 'Tis of small consequence. Go see Bernardo, And come to me again. Gaur. (solus). O happy people! whose indulgent lord Exit. From ev'ry care, with which increasing wealth, With all its hopes and fears, doth ever move The human breast, most graciously would free, And kindly leave you nought to do but toil! This creature now, with all his reptile cunning, Writhing and turning through a maze of wiles, Believes his genius form'd to rule mankind; And call his sordid wish for territory That noblest passion of the soul, ambition. Born had he been to follow some low trade, A petty tradesman still he had remain'd, And us'd the art with which he rules a state To circumvent his brothers of the craft, Or cheat the buyers of his paltry ware. And yet he thinks â ha, ha, ha, ha! â he thinks I am the tool and servant of his will. Well, let it be; through all the maze of trouble His plots and base oppression must create, I'll shape myself away to higher things: And who will say 'tis wrong? A sordid being, who expects no faith But as self-interest binds; who would not trust The strongest ties of nature on the soul, Deserves no faithful service. Perverse fate! Were I like him, I would despise this dealing: But being as I am, born low in fortune, Yet with a mind aspiring to be great, I must not scorn the steps which lead to it: And if they are not right, no saint am I: I follow nature's passion in my breast, Which urges me to rise in spite of fortune. [Exit. SCENE IV. An apartment in the palace. Victoria and Isabella are discovered playing at chess; the Countess Albini sitting by them reading to herself. Vict. Away with it, I will not play again. May men no more be foolish in my presence If thou art not a cheat, an arrant cheat! Isab. To swear that I am false by such an oath, Should prove me honest, since its forfeiture Would bring your highness gain. Vict. Thou'rt wrong, my Isabella, simple maid; For in the very forfeit of this oath, There's death to all the dearest pride of women. May man no more be foolish in my presence! Isab. And does your grace, hail'd by applauding crowds, In all the graceful eloquence address'd Of most accomplish'd, noble, courtly youths, Prais'd in the songs of heav'n-inspired bards, Those awkward proofs of admiration prize, Which rustic swains their village fair ones pay? Vict. O, love will master all the power of art! Ay, all! and she who never has beheld The polish'd courtier, or the tuneful sage, Before the glances of her conquering eye A very native simple swain become, Has only vulgar charms. To make the cunning artless, tame the rude, Subdue the haughty, shake th' undaunted soul; Yea, put a bridle in the lion's mouth, And lead him forth as a domestic cur, These are the triumphs of all-powerful beauty! Did nought but flatt'ring words and tuneful praise, Sighs, tender glances, and obsequious service, Attend her presence, it were nothing worth: I'd put a white coif o'er my braided locks, And be a plain, good, simple, fire-side dame. Alb. (raising her head from her book). And is, indeed, a plain domestic dame, Who fills the duties of an useful state, A being of less dignity than she, Who vainly on her transient beauty builds, A little poor ideal tyranny? Isab. Ideal too! Alb. Yes, most unreal pow'r: For she who only finds her self-esteem In others' admiration, begs an alms; Depends on others for her daily food, And is the very servant of her slaves; Though oftentimes, in a fantastic hour, O'er men she may a childish pow'r exert, Which not ennobles, but degrades her state. Vict. You are severe, Albini, most severe: Were human passions plac'd within the breast But to be curb'd, subdu'd, pluck'd by the roots? All heaven's gifts to some good end were giv'n. Alb. Yes, for a noble, for a generous end. Vict. Am I ungen'rous then? Alb. Yes, most ungen'rous! Who, for the pleasure of a little pow'r, Would give most unavailing pain to those Whose love you ne'er can recompense again. E'en now, to-day, O! was it not ungen'rous To fetter Basil with a foolish tie, Against his will, perhaps against his duty? Vict. What, dost thou think against his will, my friend? Alb. Full sure I am against his reason's will. Vict. Ah! but indeed thou must excuse me here; For duller than a shelled crab were she, Who could suspect her pow'r in such a mind, And calmly leave it doubtful and unprov'd. But wherefore dost thou look so gravely on me? Ah! well I read those looks! methinks they say, âYour mother did not so.â Alb. Your highness reads them true, she did not so. If foolish vanity e'er soil'd her thoughts, She kept it low, withheld its aliment; Not pamper'd it with ev'ry motley food, From the fond tribute of a noble heart To the lisp'd flattery of a cunning child. Vict. Nay, speak not thus, Albini, speak not thus Of little blue-eyed, sweet, fair-hair'd Mirando. He is the orphan of a hapless pair, A loving, beautiful, but hapless pair, Whose story is so pleasing, and so sad, The swains have turn'd it to a plaintive lay, And sing it as they tend their mountain sheep. Besides, (to Isab.) I am the guardian of his choice. When first I saw him â dost thou not remember? Isab. 'Twas in the public garden. Vict. Even so; Perch'd in his nurse's arms, a rustic quean, Ill suited to the lovely charge she bore. How stedfastly he fix'd his looks upon me, His dark eyes shining through forgotten tears, Then stretch'd his little arms and call'd me mother! What could I do? I took the bantling homeâ I could not tell the imp he had no mother. Alb. Ah! there, my child, thou hast indeed no blame. Vict. Now this is kindly said: thanks, sweet Albini! Still call me child, and chide me as thou wilt. O! would that I were such as thou couldst love! Couldst dearly love, as thou didst love my mother! Alb. (pressing her to her breast). And do I not? all-perfect as she was, I know not that she went so near my heart As thou with all thy faults. Vict. And sayst thou so? would I had sooner known! I had done any thing to give thee pleasure. Alb. Then do so now, and put thy faults away. Vict. No, say not faults; the freaks of thoughtless youth. Alb. Nay, very faults they must indeed be call'd. Vict. O! say but foibles! youthful foibles only! Alb. Faults, faults, real faults you must confess they are. Vict. In truth I cannot do your sense the wrong To think so poorly of the one you love. Alb. I must be gone: thou hast o'ercome me now: Another time I will not yield it so. [Exit. Isab. The countess is severe, she's too severe: She once was young though now advanc'd in years. Vict. No, I deserve it all: she is most worthy. Unlike those faded beauties of the court, But now the wither'd stems of former flowers With all their blossoms shed, her nobler mind Procures to her the privilege of man, Ne'er to be old till nature's strength decays. Some few years hence, if I should live so long, I'd be Albini rather than myself. Isab. Here comes your little fav'rite. Vict. I am not in the humour for him now. Enter Mirando, running up to Victoria, and taking hold of her gown, whilst she takes no notice of him, as he holds up his mouth to be kissed. Isab. (to Mir.) Thou seest the princess can't be troubled with thee. Mir. O but she will! I'll scramble up her robe, As naughty boys do when they climb for apples. Isab. Come here, sweet child; I'll kiss thee in her stead. Mir. Nay, but I will not have a kiss of thee. Would I were tall! O were I but so tall! Isab. And how tall wouldst thou be? Mir. Thou dost not know? Just tall enough to reach Victoria's lips. Vict. (embracing him). O! I must bend to this, thou little urchin! Who taught thee all this wit, this childish wit? Whom does Mirando love? [Embraces him again. Mir. He loves Victoria. Vict. And wherefore loves he her? Mir. Because she's pretty. Isab. Hast thou no little prate to-day, Mirando? No tale to earn a sugar-plum withal? Mir. Ay, that I have: I know who loves her grace. Vict. Who is it, pray? thou shalt have comfits for it. Mir. (looking slily at her). It is â it is â it is the Count of Maldo. Vict. Away, thou little chit! that tale is old, And was not worth a sugar-plum when new. Mir. Well then, I know who loves her highness well. Vict. Who is it then? Isab. Who is it, naughty boy? Mir. It is the handsome Marquis of Carlatzi. Vict. No, no, Mirando, thou art naughty still: Twice have I paid thee for that tale already. Mir. Well then, indeed â I know who loves Victoria. Vict. And who is he? Mir. It is Mirando's self. Vict. Thou little imp! this story is not new, But thou shalt have thy hire. Come, let us go. Go, run before us, boy. Mir. Nay, but I'll show you how Count Wolvar look'd, When he conducted Isabel from court. Vict. How did he look? Mir. Give me your hand: he held his body thus: (putting himself in a ridiculous bowing posture). And then he whisper'd softly; then look'd so; (ogling with his eyes affectedly). Then she look'd so, and smil'd to him again. (throwing down his eyes affectedly). Isab. Thou art a little knave, and must be whipp'd. [Exeunt, Mirando leading out Victoria affectedly. ACT III. SCENE I. An open street, or square. Enter Rosinberg and Frederic, by opposite sides of the stage. Fred. So Basil, from the pressing calls of war, Another day to rest and pastime gives. How is it now? methinks thou art not pleas'd. Ros. It matters little if I am or not. Fred. Now pray thee do confess thou art asham'd: Thou, who art wisely wont to set at naught The noble fire of individual courage, And call calm prudence the superior virtue, What sayst thou now, my candid Rosinberg, When thy great captain, in a time like this, Denies his weary troops one day of rest Before the exertions of approaching battle, Yet grants it to a pretty lady's suit? Ros. Who told thee this? it was no friendly tale; And no one else, besides a trusty friend, Could know his motives. Then thou wrongst me too; For I admire, as much as thou dost, Fred'ric, The fire of valour, e'en rash heedless valour; But not, like thee, do I depreciate That far superior, yea that god-like talent, Which doth direct that fire, because indeed It is a talent nature has denied me. Fred. Well, well, and greatly he may boast his virtue, Who risks perhaps th' imperial army's fate, To please a lady's freaksâ Ros. Go, go, thou'rt prejudic'd: A passion which I do not choose to name Has warp'd thy judgment. Fred. No, by heav'n, thou wrongst me! I do, with most enthusiastic warmth, True valour love: wherever he is found, I love the hero too; but hate to see The praises due to him so cheaply earn'd. Ros. Then mayst thou now these gen'rous feelings prove. Behold that man, whose short and grizzly hair In clust'ring locks his dark brown face o'ershades; Where now the scars of former sabre wounds, In hon'rable companionship are seen With the deep lines of age; whose piercing eye Beneath its shading eye-brow keenly darts Its yet unquenched beams, as tho' in age Its youthful fire had been again renew'd, To be the guardian of its darken'd mate. See with what vig'rous steps his upright form He onward bears; nay, e'en that vacant sleeve, Which droops so sadly by his better side, Suits not ungracefully the vet'ran's mien. This is the man, whose glorious acts in battle, We heard to-day related o'er our wine. I go to tell the gen'ral he is come: Enjoy the gen'rous feelings of thy breast, And make an old man happy. [Exit. Enter Geoffry. Fred. Brave soldier, let me profit by the chance That led me here; I've heard of thy exploits. Geof. Ah! then you have but heard an ancient tale. Which has been long forgotten. Fred. But it is true, and should not be forgotten; Though gen'rals, jealous of their soldiers' fame, May dash it with neglect. Geof. There are, perhaps, who may be so ungen'rous. Fred. Perhaps, sayst thou? in very truth there are. How art thou else rewarded with neglect, Whilst many a paltry fellow in thy corps Has been promoted? It is ever thus. Serv'd not Mardini in your company? He was, though honour'd with a valiant name, To those who knew him well, a paltry soldier. Geof. Your pardon, sir, we did esteem him much, Although inferior to his gallant friend, The brave Sebastian. Fred. The brave Sebastian! He was, as I am told, a learned coxcomb, And lov'd a goose-quill better than a sword. What, dost thou call him brave? Thou, who dost bear about that war-worn trunk, Like an old target, hack'd and rough with wounds, Whilst, after all his mighty battles, he Was with a smooth skin in his coffin laid, Unblemish'd with a scar. Geof. His duty call'd not to such desp'rate service. For I have fought where few alive remain'd, And none unscath'd; where but a few remain'd, Thus marr'd and mangled; (showing his wounds) As belike you've seen, O' summer nights, around the evening lamp, Some wretched moths, wingless, and half consum'd, Just feebly crawling o'er their heaps of dead.â In Savoy, on a small, though desp'rate post, Of full three hundred goodly chosen men, But twelve were left, and right dear friends were we For ever after. They are all dead now: I'm old and lonely.âWe were valiant heartsâ Fred'ric Dewalter would have stopp'd a breach Against the devil himself. I'm lonely now! Fred. I'm sorry for thee. Hang ungrateful chiefs! Why wert thou not promoted? Geof. After that battle, where my happy fate Had led me to fulfil a glorious part, Chaf'd with the gibing insults of a slave, The worthless fav'rite of a great man's fav'rite, I rashly did affront; our cautious prince, With narrow policy dependant made, Dar'd not, as I am told, promote me then, And now he is asham'd, or has forgot it. Fred. Fye, fye upon it! let him be asham'd! Here is a trifle for theeâ (offering him money.) Geof. No, good sir, I have enough to live as poor men do. When I'm in want I'll thankfully receive, Because I'm poor, but not because I'm brave. Fred. You're proud, old soldier. Geof. No, I am not proud; For if I were, methinks I'd be morose, And willing to depreciate other men. Enter Rosinberg. Ros. (clapping Geof. on the shoulder). How goes it with thee now, my good field-marshal? Geof. The better that I see your honour well, And in the humour to be merry with me. Ros. Faith, by my sword, I've rightly nam'd thee too: What is a good field-marshal, but a man, Whose gen'rous courage and undaunted mind, Doth marshal others on in glory's way? Thou art not one by princely favour dubb'd, But one of nature's making. Geof. You show, my lord, such pleasant courtesy, I know not howâ Ros. But see, the gen'ral comes. Enter Basil. Ros. (pointing to Geoffry). Behold the worthy vet'ran. Bas. (taking him by the hand). Brave honourable man, your worth I know, And greet it with a brother soldier's love. Geof. (taking away his hand in confusion). My gen'ral, this is too much, too much honour. Bas. (taking his hand again). No, valiant soldier, I must have it so. Geof. My humble state agrees not with such honour. Bas. Think not of it, thy state is not thyself. Let mean souls, highly rank'd, look down on thee, As the poor dwarf, perch'd on a pedestal, O'erlooks the gaint: 'tis not worth a thought. Art thou not Geoffry of the tenth brigade, Whose warlike feats child, maid, and matron know, And oft, cross-elbow'd, o'er his nightly bowl, The jolly toper to his comrade tells; Whose glorious feats of war, by cottage door, The ancient soldier, tracing in the sand The many movements of the varied field, In warlike terms to list'ning swains relates; Whose bosoms glowing at the wondrous tale, First learn to scorn the hind's inglorious life? Shame seize me, if I would not rather be The man thou art, than court-created chief, Known only by the dates of his promotion. Geof. Ah! would I were, would I were young again, To fight beneath your standard, noble gen'ral! Methinks what I have done were but a jest, Ay, but a jest to what I now should do, Were I again the man that I have been. O! I could fight! Bas. And wouldst thou fight for me? Geof. Ay, to the death! Bas. Then come, brave man, and be my champion still: The sight of thee will fire my soldiers' breasts. Come, noble vet'ran, thou shalt fight for me. [Exit with Geoffry. Fred. What does he mean to do? Ros. We'll know ere long. Fred. Our gen'ral bears it with a careless face, For one so wise. Ros. A careless face! on what? Fred. Now, feign not ignorance, we know it all. News which have spread in whispers from the court, Since last night's messenger arriv'd from Milan. Ros. As I'm an honest man, I know it not! Fred. 'Tis said the rival armies are so near, A battle must immediately ensue. Ros. It cannot be. Our gen'ral knows it not. The Duke is of our side a sworn ally, And had such messenger to Mantua come, He would have been appriz'd upon the instant. It cannot be; it is some idle tale. Fred. So may it prove till we have joined them too, Then heaven grant they may be nearer still! For O! my soul for war and danger pants, As doth the noble lion for his prey. My soul delights in battle. Ros. Upon my simple word, I'd rather see A score of friendly fellows shaking hands, Than all the world in arms. Hast thou no fear? Fred. What dost thou mean? Ros. Hast thou no fear of death? Fred. Fear is a name for something in the mind, But what, from inward sense, I cannot tell. I could as little anxious march to battle, As when a boy to childish games I ran. Ros. Then as much virtue hast thou in thy valour As when a child thou hadst in childish play. The brave man is not he who feels no fear, For that were stupid and irrational; But he, whose noble soul its fear subdues, And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from. As for your youth, whom blood and blows delight, Away with them! there is not in the crew One valiant spirit â Ha! what sound is this? [Shouting is heard without. Fred. The soldiers shout; I'll run and learn the cause. Ros. But tell me first, how didst thou like the vet'ran? Fred. He is too proud; he was displeas'd with me Because I offer'd him a little sum. Ros. What money! O! most gen'rous noble spirit! Noble rewarder of superior worth! A halfpenny for Belisarius! But hark! they shout again â here comes Valtomer. [Shouting heard without. Enter Valtomer. What does this shouting mean? Valt. O! I have seen a sight, a glorious sight! Thou wouldst have smil'd to see it. Ros. How smile? methinks thine eyes are wet with tears. Valt. (passing the back of his hands across his eyes). 'Faith so they are; well, well, but I smil'd too. You heard the shouting. Ros. and Fred. Yes. Valt. O had you seen it! Drawn out in goodly ranks, there stood our troops; Here, in the graceful state of manly youth, His dark face brighten'd with a gen'rous smile, Which to his eyes such flashing lustre gave, As though his soul, like an unsheathed sword, Had through them gleam'd, our noble gen'ral stood; And to his soldiers, with heart-moving words, The vet'ran showing, his brave deeds rehears'd; Who by his side stood like a storm-scath'd oak, Beneath the shelter of some noble tree, In the green honours of its youthful prime. Ros. How look'd the veteran? Valt. I cannot tell thee! At first he bore it up with cheerful looks, As one who fain would wear his honours bravely, And greet the soldiers with a comrade's face: But when Count Basil, in such moving speech, Told o'er his actions past, and bade his troops Great deeds to emulate, his count'nance chang'd; High-heav'd his manly breast, as it had been By inward strong emotion half convuls'd; Trembled his nether lip; he shed some tears. The gen'ral paus'd, the soldiers shouted loud; Then hastily he brush'd the drops away, And wav'd his hand, and clear'd his tear-chok'd voice, As though he would some grateful answer make; When back with double force the whelming tide Of passion came; high o'er his hoary head His arm he toss'd, and heedless of respect, In Basil's bosom hid his aged face, Sobbing aloud. From the admiring ranks A cry arose; still louder shouts resound. I felt a sudden tightness grasp my throat As it would strangle me; such as I felt, I knew it well, some twenty years ago, When my good father shed his blessing on me: I hate to weep, and so I came away. Ros. (giving Valt. his hand). And there, take thou my blessing for the tale. Hark! how they shout again! 'tis nearer now. This way they march. [Martial music heard. Enter Soldiers marching in order, bearing Geoffry in triumph on their shoulders. After them enter Basil: the whole preceded by a band of music. They cross over the stage, are joined by Ros. &amp;c., and Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Gauriecio and a Gentleman, talking as they enter. Gaur. So slight a tie as this we cannot trust, One day her influence may detain him here, But love a feeble agent may be found With the ambitious. Gent. And so you think this boyish odd conceit Of bearing home in triumph with his troops That aged soldier, will your purpose serve? Gaur. Yes, I will make it serve; for though my prince Is little scrupulous of right and wrong, I have possess'd his mind, as though it were A flagrant insult on his princely state To honour thus the man he has neglected, Which makes him relish, with a keener taste, My purpos'd scheme. Come, let us fall to work. With all their warm heroic feelings rous'd, We'll spirit up his troops to mutiny, Which must retard, perhaps undo him quite. Thanks to his childish love, which has so well Procur'd us time to tamper with the fools. Gent. Ah! but those feelings he has wak'd within them Are gen'rous feelings, and endear himself. Gaur. It matters not, though gen'rous in their nature, They yet may serve a most ungen'rous end; And he who teaches men to think, though nobly, Doth raise within their minds a busy judge To scan his actions. Send thine agents forth, And sound it in their ears how much Count Basil Affects all difficult and desp'rate service, To raise his fortunes by some daring stroke; Having unto the emperor pledg'd his word, To make his troops all dreadful hazards brave: For which intent he fills their simple minds With idle tales of glory and renown; Using their warm attachment to himself For most unworthy ends. This is the busy time; go forth, my friend; Mix with the soldiers, now in jolly groups Around their ev'ning cups. There, spare no cost. [Gives him a purse. Observe their words, see how the poison takes, And then return again. Gent. I will, my lord. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A suite of grand apartments, with their wide doors thrown open, lighted up with lamps, and filled with company in masks. Enter several masks, and pass through the first apartment to the other rooms. Then enter Basil in the disguise of a wounded soldier. Bas. (alone). Now am I in the region of delight! Within the blessed compass of these walls She is; the gay light of those blazing lamps Doth shine upon her, and this painted floor Is with her footsteps press'd. E'en now, perhaps, Amidst that motley rout she plays her part: There will I go; she cannot be conceal'd; For but the flowing of her graceful robe Will soon betray the lovely form that wears it, Though in a thousand masks. Ye homely weeds,â (looking at his habit). Which half conceal, and half declare my state, Beneath your kind disguise, O! let me prosper, And boldly take the privilege ye give: Follow her mazy steps, crowd by her side; Thus, near her face my list'ning ear incline, And feel her soft breath fan my glowing cheek; Her fair hand seize, yea, press it closely too! May it not be e'en so? by heav'n it shall! This once, O! serve me well, and ever after Ye shall be treasur'd like a monarch's robes; Lodg'd in my chamber, near my pillow kept; And oft with midnight lamp I'll visit ye, And gazing wistfully, this night recall, With all its past delights. â But yonder moves A slender form, dress'd in an azure robe; It moves not like the rest â it must be she! [Goes hastily into another apartment, and mixes with the masks. Enter Rosinberg, fantastically dressed, with a willow upon his head, and scraps of sonnets and torn letters fluttering round his neck, pursued by a group of masks from one of the inner apartments, who hoot at him, and push him about as he enters. 1st Mask. Away, thou art a saucy jeering knave, And fain wouldst make a jest of all true love. Ros. Nay, gentle ladies, do not buffet me: I am a right true servant of the fair; And as this woeful chaplet on my brow, And these tear-blotted sonnets would denote, A poor abandon'd lover out of place; With any lady ready to engage, Who will enlist me in her loving service. Of a convenient kind my talents are, And to all various humours may be shap'd. 2nd Mask. What canst thou do? 3d Mask. Ay, what besides offending? Ros. O! I can sigh so deeply, look so sad; Pule out a piteous tale on bended knee; Groan like a ghost; so very wretched be, As would delight a tender lady's heart But to behold. 1st Mask. Pooh, pooh, insipid fool! Ros. But should my lady brisker mettle own, And tire of all those gentle dear delights, Such pretty little quarrels I'd inventâ As whether such a fair one (some dear friend) Whose squirrel's tail was pinch'd, or the soft maid, With fav'rite lap-dog of a surfeit sick, Have greatest cause of delicate distress: Or whetherâ 1st Mask. Go, thou art too bad indeedâ (aside). How could he know I quarrell'd with the Count? 2nd Mask. Wilt thou do nothing for thy lady's fame? Ros. Yes, lovely shepherdess, on ev'ry tree I'll carve her name, with true-love garlands bound: Write madrigals upon her roseate cheeks; Odes to her eye; 'faith, ev'ry wart and mole That spots her snowy skin, shall have its sonnet! I'll make love-posies for her thimble's edge, Rather than please her not. 3d Mask. But for her sake what dangers wilt thou brave? Ros. In truth, fair nun, I stomach dangers less Than other service, and were something loath To storm a convent's walls for one dear glance; But if she'll wisely manage this alone, As maids have done, come o'er the wall herself, And meet me fairly on the open plain, I will engage her tender steps to aid In all annoyance of rude briar or stone, Or crossing rill, some half-foot wide, or so, Which that fair lady should unaided pass, Ye gracious pow'rs, forbid! I will defend Against each hideous fly, whose dreadful buzz â 4th Mask. Such paltry service suits thee best indeed. What maid of spirit would not spurn thee from her? Ros. Yes, to recall me soon, sublime Sultana! For I can stand the burst of female passion, Each change of humour and affected storm, Be scolded, frown'd upon, to exile sent, Recall'd, caress'd, chid, and disgrac'd again; And say what maid of spirit would forego The bliss of one to exercise it thus? O! I can bear ill treatment like a lamb!â 4th Mask (beating him). Well, bear it then, thou hast deserv'd it well. Ros. Zounds, lady! do not give such heavy blows; I'm not your husband, as belike you guess. 5th Mask. Come, lover, I enlist thee for my swain; Therefore, good lady, do forbear your blows, Nor thus assume my rights. Ros. Agreed. Wilt thou a gracious mistress prove? 5th Mask. Such as thou wouldst, such as thy genius suits; For since of universal scope it is, All women's humour shalt thou find in me. I'll gently soothe thee with such winning smilesâ To nothing sink thee with a scornful frown: Teaze thee with peevish and affected freaks; Caress thee, love thee, hate thee, break thy pate; But still between the whiles I'll careful be, In feigned admiration of thy parts, Thy shape, thy manners, or thy graceful mien, To bind thy giddy soul with flatt'ry's charm; For well thou knowst that flatt'ry ever is The tickling spice, the pungent seasoning Which makes this motley dish of monstrous scraps So pleasing to the dainty lover's taste. Thou canst not leave, though violent in extreme, And most vexatious in her teazing moods, Thou canst not leave the fond admiring soul, Who did declare, when calmer reason rul'd, Thou hadst a pretty leg. Ros. Marry, thou hast the better of me there. 5th Mask. And more! I'll pledge to thee my honest word, That when your noble swainship shall bestow More faithful homage on the simple maid, Who loves you with sincerity and truth, Than on the changeful and capricious tyrant, Who mocking leads you like a trammell'd ass, My studied woman's wiles I'll lay aside, And such an one become. Ros. Well said, brave lady, I will follow thee. [Follows her to the corner of the stage. Now on my life these ears of mine I'd give, To have but one look of that little face, Where such a biting tongue doth hold its court To keep the fools in awe. Nay, nay, unmask: I'm sure thou hast a pair of wicked eyes, A short and saucy nose; now pri'thee do. [Unmasking. Alb. (unmasking). Well, hast thou guess'd me right? Ros. (bowing low). Wild freedom, chang'd to most profound respect, Doth make an awkward booby of me now. Alb. I've joined your frolic with a good intent, For much I wish'd to gain your private ear. The time is precious, and I must be short. Ros. On me thy slightest word more pow'r will have, Most honour'd lady, than a conn'd oration. Thou art the only one of all thy sex, Who wearst thy years with such a winning grace. Thou art the more admir'd the more thou fad'st. Alb. I thank your lordship for these courteous words; But to my purpose â You are Basil's friend: Be friendly to him then, and warn him well This court to leave, nor be allur'd to stay; For if he does, there's mischief waits him here May prove the bane of all his future days. Remember this, I must no longer stay. God bless your friend and you: I love you both. [Exit. Ros. (alone). What may this warning mean? I had my fears. There's something hatching that I know not of. I've lost all spirit for this masking now. [Throwing away his papers and his willows. Away, ye scraps! I have no need of you. I would I knew what garment Basil wears: I watch'd him, yet he did escape my sight; But I must search again and find him out. [Exit. Enter Basil much agitated, with his mask in his hand. Bas. In vain I've sought her, follow'd every form Where aught appear'd of dignity or grace: I've listen'd to the tone of ev'ry voice; I've watch'd the entrance of each female mask, My flutt'ring heart rous'd like a startled hare, With the imagin'd rustling of her robes, At ev'ry dame's approach. Deceitful night, How art thou spent! where are thy promis'd joys? How much of thee is gone! O spiteful fate! And yet within the compass of these walls Somewhere she is, although to me she is not. Some other eye doth gaze upon her form, Some other ear doth listen to her voice; Some happy fav'rite doth enjoy the bliss My spiteful stars deny. Disturber of my soul! what veil conceals thee? What dev'lish spell is o'er this cursed hour? O! heav'ns and earth, where art thou! Enter a mask in the dress of a female conjurer. Mask. Methinks thou art impatient, valiant soldier: Thy wound doth gall thee sorely; is it so? Bas. Away, away! I cannot fool with thee. Mask. I have some potent drugs may ease thy smart. Where is thy wound? is't here? [Pointing to the bandage on his arm. Bas. Pooh, pooh, begone! Thou canst do noughtâ'tis in my head, my heartâ 'Tis ev'ry where, where med'cine cannot cure. Mask. If wounded in the heart, it is a wound Which some ungrateful fair one hath inflicted, And I may conjure something for thy good. Bas. Ah! if thou couldst! what, must I fool with thee? Mask. Thou must awhile, and be examin'd too. What kind of woman did the wicked deed? Bas. I cannot tell thee. In her presence still My mind in such a wild delight hath been, I could not pause to picture out her beauty, Yet nought of woman e'er was form'd so fair. Mask. Art thou a soldier, and no weapon bearst To send her wound for wound? Bas. Alas! she shoots from such a hopeless height, No dart of mine hath plume to mount so far; None but a prince may dare. Mask. But if thou hast no hope, thou hast no love. Bas. I love, and yet in truth I had no hope. But that she might at least with some good will, Some gentle pure regard, some secret kindness, Within her dear remembrance give me place. This was my all of hope, but it is flown: For she regards me not: despises, scorns me: Scorns, I must say it too, a noble heart, That would have bled for her. [Mask, discovering herself to be Victoria, by speaking in her true voice. O! no, she does not. [Exit hastily in confusion. Bas. (stands for a moment riveted to the spot, then holds up both his hands in an ecstacy). It is herself! it is her blessed self! O! what a fool am I, that had no power To follow her, and urge th' advantage on. Begone, unmanly fears! I must be bold. [Exit after her. A dance of masks. Enter Duke and Gauriecio, unmasked. Duke. This revelry, methinks, goes gaily on. The hour is late, and yet your friend returns not. Gaur. He will return ere long â nay, there he comes. Enter Gentleman. Duke. Does all go well? (going close up to him.) Gent. All as your grace could wish. For now the poison works, and the stung soldiers Rage o'er their cups, and, with fire-kindled eyes, Swear vengeance on the chief who would betray them. That Frederic too, the discontented man Of whom your highness was so lately told, Swallows the bait, and does his part most bravely. Gauriecio counsell'd well to keep him blind, Nor with a bribe attempt him. On my soul! He is so fiery he had spurn'd us else, And ruin'd all the plot. Duke. Speak softly, friend â I'll hear it all in private. A gay and careless face we now assume. [Duke, Gaur. and Gent. retire into the inner apartment, appearing to laugh and talk gaily to the different masks as they pass them. Re-enter Victoria, followed by Basil. Vict. Forbear, my lord; these words offend mine ear. Bas. Yet let me but this once, this once offend, Nor thus with thy displeasure punish me; And if my words against all prudence sin, O! hear them, as the good of heart do list To the wild ravings of a soul distraught Vict. If I indeed should listen to thy words, They must not talk of love. Bas. To be with thee, to speak, to hear thee speak, To claim the soft attention of thine eye, I'd be content to talk of any thing, If it were possible to be with thee, And think of aught but love. Vict. I fear, my lord, you have too much presum'd On those unguarded words, which were in truth Utter'd at unawares, with little heed, And urge their meaning far beyond the right. Bas. I thought, indeed, that they were kindly meant, As though thy gentle breast did kindly feel Some secret pity for my hopeless pain, And would not pierce with scorn, ungen'rous scorn, A heart so deeply stricken. Vict. So far thou'st read it well. Bas. Ha! have I well? Thou dost not hate me then? Vict. My father comes; He were displeas'd if he should see thee thus. Bas. Thou dost not hate me then? Vict. Away! he'll be displeas'd â I cannot sayâ Bas. Well, let him come: it is thyself I fear: For did destruction thunder o'er my head, By the dread pow'r of heav'n I would not stir Till thou hadst answer'd my impatient soul! Thou dost not hate me? Vict. Nay, nay, let go thy hold â I cannot hate thee. [Breaks from him and exit. Bas. (alone). Thou canst not hate me! no, thou canst not hate me! For I love thee so well, so passing well, With such o'erflowing heart, so very dearly, That it were sinful not to pay me back Some small, some kind return. Enter Mirando, dressed like Cupid. Mir. Bless thee, brave soldier! Bas. What sayst thou, pretty child! what playful fair Has deck'd thee out in this fantastic guise? Mir. It was Victoria's self; it was the princess. Bas. Thou art her fav'rite then? Mir They say I am: And now, between ourselves, I'll tell thee, soldier, I think in very truth she loves me well. Such merry little songs she teaches meâ Sly riddles too, and when I'm laid to rest, Ofttimes on tip-toe near my couch she steals, And lifts the cov'ring so, to look upon me. And oftentimes I feign as though I slept; For then her warm lips to my cheeks she lays, And pats me softly with her fair white hands; And then I laugh, and through mine eye-lids peep, And then she tickles me, and calls me cheat; And then we do so laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha! Bas. What does she even so, thou happiest child? And have those rosy cheeks been press'd so dearly? Delicious urchin! I will kiss thee too. [Takes him eagerly up in his arms and kisses him. Mir. No, let me down, thy kisses are so rough, So furious rough â she doth not kiss me so. Bas. Sweet boy, where is thy chamber? by Victoria's? Mir. Hard by her own. Bas. Then will I come beneath thy window soon; And, if I could, some pretty song I'd sing, To lull thee to thy rest. Mir. O no, thou must not! 'tis a frightful place; It is the church-yard of the neighb'ring dome. The princess loves it for the lofty trees, Whose spreading branches shade her chamber walls: So do not I; for when 'tis dark o'nights, Goblins howl there, and ghosts rise through the ground. I hear them many a time when I'm a bed, And hide beneath the clothes my cow'ring head. O! is it not a frightful thing, my lord, To sleep alone i' the dark? Bas. Poor harmless child! thy prate is wondrous sweet. Enter a group of masks. 1st Mask. What dost thou here, thou little truant boy? Come play thy part with us. Masks place Mirando in the middle, and range themselves round him. SONG.â a glee. Child, with many a childish wile, Timid look, and blushing smile, Downy wings to steal thy way, Gilded bow, and quiver gay, Who in thy simple mien would trace The tyrant of the human race? Who is he whose flinty heart Hath not felt the flying dart? Who is he that from the wound Hath not pain and pleasure found? Who is he that hath not shed Curse and blessing on thy head? Ah Love! our weal, our woe, our bliss, our bane, A restless life have they who wear thy chain! Ah Love! our weal, our woe, our bliss, our bane, More hapless still are they who never felt thy pain! [All the masks dance round Cupid. Then enter a band of satyrs, who frighten away Love and his votaries; and conclude the scene, dancing in a grotesque manner. ACT IV. SCENE I. The street before Basil's lodging. Enter Rosinberg and two Officers. Ros. (speaking as he enters). Unless we find him quickly, all is lost. 1st Off. His very guards, methinks, have left their post To join the mutiny. Ros. (knocking very loud). Holla! who's there within? confound this door! It will not yield. O for a giant's strength! Holla, holla, within! will no one hear? Enter a porter from the house. Ros. (eagerly to the porter). Is he return'd? is he return'd? not yet! Thy face doth tell me so. Port. Not yet, my lord. Ros. Then let him ne'er return!â Tumult, disgrace, and ruin have their way! I'll search for him no more. Port. He hath been absent all the night, my lord. Ros. I know he hath. 2nd Off. And yet 'tis possible He may have enter'd by the secret door; And now, perhaps, in deepest sleep entranc'd, Is dead to ev'ry sound. [Ros., without speaking, rushes into the house, and the rest follow him. Enter Basil. Bas. The blue air of the morning pinches keenly. Beneath her window all the chilly night, I felt it not. Ah! night has been my day; And the pale lamp which from her chamber gleam'd, Has to the breeze a warmer temper lent Than the red burning east. Re-enter Rosinberg, &amp;c. from the house. Ros. Himself! himself! he's here! he's here! O Basil! What fiend at such a time could lead thee forth? Bas. What is the matter that disturbs you thus? Ros. Matter that would a wiser man disturb. Treason's abroad: thy men have mutinied. Bas. It is not so; thy wits have mutinied, And left their sober station in thy brain. 1st Off. Indeed, my lord, he speaks in sober earnest. Some secret enemies have been employ'd To fill your troops with strange imaginations: As though their gen'ral would, for selfish gain, Their gen'rous valour urge to desp'rate deeds. All to a man, assembled on the ramparts, Now threaten vengeance, and refuse to march. Bas. What! think they vilely of me? threaten too! O! most ungen'rous, most unmanly thought! Didst thou attempt (to Ros.) to reason with their folly? Folly it is; baseness it cannot be. Ros. Yes, truly, I did reason with a storm, And bid it cease to rage.â Their eyes look fire on him who questions them: The hollow murmurs of their mutter'd wrath Sound dreadful through the dark extended ranks, Like subterraneous grumblings of an earthquake. â The vengeful hurricane Does not with such fantastic writhings toss The woods' green boughs, as does convulsive rage Their forms with frantic gestures agitate. Around the chief of hell such legions throng'd, To bring back curse and discord on creation. Bas. Nay they are men, although impassion'd ones. I'll go to themâ Ros. And we will stand by thee. My sword is thine against ten thousand strong, If it should come to this. Bas. No, never, never! There is no mean: I with my soldiers must Or their commander or their victim prove. But are my officers all staunch and faithful? Ros. All but that devil, Fred'ricâ He, disappointed, left his former corps, Where he, in truth, had been too long neglected, Thinking he should all on the sudden rise, From Basil's well-known love of valiant men; And now, because it still must be deferr'd, He thinks you seek from envy to depress him, And burns to be reveng'd. Bas. Well, well â This grieves me too â But let us go. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The ramparts of the town. The soldiers are discovered, drawn up in a disorderly manner, hollaing and speaking loudly, and clashing their arms tumultuously. 1st Sol. No, comrade, no; hell gape and swallow me, If I do budge for such most dev'lish orders! 2nd Sol. Huzza! brave comrades! Who says otherwise? 3d Sol. No one, huzza! confound all treach'rous leaders! [The soldiers huzza and clash their arms. 4th Sol. Heav'n dart its fiery light'ning on his head! We're men, we are not cattle to be slaughter'd! 2nd Sol. They who do long to caper high in air, Into a thousand bloody fragments blown, May follow our brave gen'ral. 1st Sol. Curse his name! I've fought for him till my strain'd nerves have crack'd! 2nd Sol. We will command ourselves: for Milan, comrades. 4th Sol. Ay, ay, for Milan, valiant hearts, huzza! [All the soldiers cast up their caps in the air, and huzza. 2nd Sol. Yes, comrades, tempting booty waits us there, And easy seryice: keep good hearts, my soldiers! The gen'ral comes, good hearts! no flinching, boys! Look bold and fiercely: we're the masters now. [They all clash their arms and put on a fierce threatening aspect to receive their general, who now enters, followed by Rosinberg and officers. Basil walks close along the front ranks of the soldiers, looking at them very stedfastly; then retires a few paces back, and raising his arm, speaks with a very full loud voice. Bas. How is it, soldiers, that I see you thus, Assembled here, unsummon'd by command? (A confused murmur is heard amongst the soldiers; some of them call out) But we command ourselves; we wait no orders. (A confused noise of voices is heard, and one louder than the rest calls out) Must we be butcher'd, for that we are brave? (A loud clamour and clashing of arms, then several voices call out) Damn hidden treach'ry! we defy thy orders. Fred'ric shall lead us now â (Other voices call out) We'll march where'er we list, for Milan march. Bas. (waving his hand, and beckoning them to be silent, speaks with a very loud voice). Yes, march where'er ye list; for Milan march. Sol. Hear him, hear him! [The murmur ceases â a short pause. Bas. Yes, march where'er ye list: for Milan march: But as banditti, not as soldiers go; For on this spot of earth I will disband, And take from you the rank and name of soldiers. (A great clamour amongst the ranks; some call out) What wear we arms for? (Others call out) No, he dares not do it. (One voice very loud) Disband us at thy peril, treach'rous Basil! [Several of the soldiers brandish their arms, and threaten to attack him; the officers gather round Basil, and draw their swords to defend him. Bas. Put up your swords, my friends, it must not be. I thank your zeal, I'll deal with them alone. Ros. What, shall we calmly stand and see thee butcher'd? Bas. (very earnestly). Put up, my friends! (Officers still persist.) What! are you rebels too? Will no one here his gen'ral's voice obey? I do command you to put up your swords. Retire, and at a distance wait th' event. Obey, or henceforth be no friends of mine. [Officers retire very unwillingly. Basil waves them off with his hand till they are all gone, then walks up to the front of his soldiers, who still hold themselves in a threatening posture. Soldiers! we've fought together in the field, And bravely fought: i' the face of horrid death, At honour's call, I've led you dauntless on; Nor do I know the man of all your bands, That ever poorly from the trial shrunk, Or yielded to the foe contended space. Am I the meanest then of all my troops, That thus ye think, with base unmanly threats, To move me now? Put up those paltry weapons; They edgeless are to him who fears them not: Rocks have been shaken from the solid base; But what shall move a firm and dauntless mind? Put up your swords, or dare the threaten'd deed â Obey, or murder me. â (A confused murmur â some of the soldiers call out) March us to Milan, and we will obey thee. (Others call out) Ay, march us there, and be our leader still. Bas. Nay, if I am your leader, I'll command ye; And where I do command, there shall you go, But not to Milan. No, nor shall you deviate E'en half a furlong from your destin'd way, To seize the golden booty of the East. Think not to gain, or temporise with me; For should I this day's mutiny survive, Much as I've lov'd you, soldiers, ye shall find me Still more relentless in pursuit of vengeance; Tremendous, cruel, military vengeance. There is no mean â a desp'rate game ye play; Therefore, I say, obey, or murder me. Do as ye will, but do it manfully. He is a coward who doth threaten me: The man who slays me, but an angry soldier; Acting in passion, like the frantic son, Who struck his sire and wept. (Soldiers call out) It was thyself who sought to murder us. 1st Sol. You have unto the emp'ror pledg'd your faith, To lead us foremost in all desp'rate service: You have agreed to sell your soldiers' blood, And we have shed our dearest blood for you. Bas. Hear me, my soldiers â 2d Sol. No, hear him not, he means to cozen you. Fred'rick will do you right â [Endeavouring to stir up a noise and confusion amongst them. Bas. What cursed fiend art thou, cast out from hell To spirit up rebellion? damned villain! [Seizes upon 2d soldier, drags him out from the ranks, and wrests his arms from him; then takes a pistol from his side, and holds it to his head. Stand there, damn'd meddling villain, and be silent; For if thou utt'rest but a single word, A cough or hem, to cross me in my speech, I'll send thy cursed spirit from the earth, To bellow with the damn'd! [The soldiers keep a dead silence. After a pause, Basil resumes his speech. Listen to me, my soldiers. â You say that I am to the emp'ror pledg'd To lead you foremost in all desp'rate service, For now you call it not the path of glory; And if in this I have offended you, I do indeed repent me of the crime. But new from battles, where my native troops So bravely fought, I felt me proud at heart, And boasted of you, boasted foolishly. I said, fair glory's palm ye would not yield To e'er the bravest legion train'd to arms. I swore the meanest man of all my troops Would never shrink before an armed host, If honour bade him stand. My royal master Smil'd at the ardour of my heedless words, And promis'd when occasion claim'd our arms, To put them to the proof. But ye do peace, and ease, and booty love, Safe and ignoble service â be it soâ Forgive me that I did mistake you thus, But do not earn with savage mutiny, Your own destruction. We'll for Pavia march, To join the royal army near its walls, And there with blushing forehead will I plead, That ye are men with warlike service worn, Requiring ease and rest. Some other chief, Whose cold blood boils not at the trumpet's sound, Will in your rearward station head you then, And so, my friends, we'll part. As for myself, A volunteer, unheeded in the ranks, I'll rather fight, with brave men for my fellows, Than be the leader of a sordid band. (A great murmur rises amongst the ranks, soldiers call out) We will not part! no, no, we will not part! (All call out together) We will not part! be thou our gen'ral still! Bas. How can I be your gen'ral? ye obey As caprice moves you; I must be obey'd, As honest men against themselves perform A sacred oath.â Some other chief will more indulgent prove â You're weary grown â I've been too hard a master. Soldiers. Thyself, and only thee, will we obey. Bas. But if you follow me, yourselves ye pledge Unto no easy service: â hardships, toils, The hottest dangers of most dreadful fight Will be your portion; and when all is o'er, Each, like his gen'ral, must contented be Home to return again, a poor brave soldier. How say ye now? I spread no tempting lureâ A better fate than this, I promise none. Soldiers. We'll follow Basil. Bas. What token of obedience will ye give? [A deep pause. Soldiers, lay down your arms! [They all lay down their arms. If any here are weary of the service, Now let them quit the ranks, and they shall have A free discharge, and passport to their homes; And from my scanty fortune I'll make good The well-earn'd pay their royal master owes them. Let those who follow me their arms resume, [They all resume their arms. (Basil, holding up his hands). High heaven be prais'd! I had been griev'd to part with you, my soldiers. Here is a letter from my gracious master, With offers of preferment in the north, Most high preferment, which I did refuse, For that I would not leave my gallant troops. [Takes out a letter, and throws it amongst them. (A great commotion amongst the soldiers; many of them quit their ranks, and crowd about him, calling out) Our gallant gen'ral! (Others call out) We'll spend our hearts' blood for thee, noble Basil! Bas. And so you thought me false? this bites to the quick! My soldiers thought me false! [They all quit their ranks, and crowd eagerly around him. Basil, waving them off with his hands. Away, away, you have disgusted me! [Soldiers retire to their ranks. 'Tis well â retire, and hold yourselves prepar'd To march upon command; nor meet again Till you are summon'd by the beat of drum. Some secret enemy has tamper'd with you, For yet I will not think that in these ranks There moves a man who wears a traitor's heart. [The soldiers begin to march off, and music strikes up. Bas. (holding up his hand). Cease, cease, triumphant sounds; Which our brave fathers, men without reproach, Rais'd in the hour of triumph! but this hour To us no glory brings â Then silent be your march â ere that again Our steps to glorious strains like these shall move, A day of battle o'er our heads must pass, And blood be shed to wash out this day's stain. [Exeunt soldiers, silent and dejected. Enter Frederic, who starts back on seeing Basil alone. Bas. Advance, lieutenant; wherefore shrink you back? I've ever seen you bear your head erect, And front your man, though arm'd with frowning death. Have you done aught the valiant should not do? I fear you have. [Fred. looks confused. With secret art, and false insinuation, The simple untaught soldiers to seduce From their sworn duty, might become the base, Become the coward well; but O! what villain Had the dark pow'r t' engage thy valiant worth In such a work as this? Fred. Is Basil, then, so lavish of his praise On a neglected pitiful subaltern? It were a libel on his royal master; A foul reproach upon fair fortune cast, To call me valiant: And surely he has been too much their debtor, To mean them this rebuke. Bas. Is nature then so sparing of her gifts, That it is wonderful when they are found Where fortune smiles not? Thou art by nature brave, and so am I; But in those distant ranks moves there not one [Pointing off the stage. Of high ennobled soul, by nature form'd A hero and commander, who will yet In his untrophied grave forgotten lie With meaner men? I dare be sworn there does. Fred. What need of words? I crave of thee no favour. I have offended, 'gainst arm'd law offended, And shrink not from my doom. Bas. I know thee well, I know thou fearst not death; On scaffold or in field with dauntless breast Thou wilt engage him; and if thy proud soul, In sullen obstinacy, scorns all grace, E'en be it so. But if with manly gratitude Thou truly canst receive a brave man's pardon, Thou hast it freely. Fred. It must not be. I've been thine enemy â I've been unjust to thee â Bas. I know thou hast; But thou art brave, and I forgive thee all. Fred. My lord! my gen'ral! Oh, I cannot speak! I cannot live and be the wretch I am! Bas. But thou canst live and be an honest man From error turn'd, â canst live and be my friend. [Raising Fred. from the ground. Forbear, forbear! see where our friends advance: They must not think thee suing for a pardon; That would disgrace us both. Yet ere they come, Tell me, if that thou mayst with honour tell, What did seduce thee from thy loyal faith? Fred. No cunning traitor did my faith attempt, For then I had withstood him: but of late, I know not how â a bad and restless spirit Has work'd within my breast, and made me wretched. I've lent mine ear to foolish idle tales, Of very zealous, though but recent friends. Bas. Softly, our friends approach â of this again. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An apartment in Basil's lodgings. Enter Basil and Rosinberg. Ros. Thank heaven I am now alone with thee. Last night I sought thee with an anxious mind, And curs'd thine ill-tim'd absence. â There's treason in this most deceitful court, Against thee plotting, and this morning's tumult Hath been its damn'd effect. Bas. Nay, nay, my friend! The nature of man's mind too well thou knowst, To judge as vulgar hoodwink'd statesmen do; Who, ever with their own poor wiles misled, Believe each popular tumult or commotion Must be the work of deep-laid policy. Poor, mean, mechanic souls, who little know A few short words of energetic force, Some powerful passion on the sudden rous'd, The animating sight of something noble, Some fond trait of the mem'ry finely wak'd, A sound, a simple song without design, In revolutions, tumults, wars, rebellions, All grand events, have oft effected more Than deepest cunning of their paltry art. Some drunken soldier, eloquent with wine, Who loves not fighting, hath harangu'd his mates, For they in truth some hardships have endur'd: Wherefore in this should we suspect the court? Ros. Ah! there is something, friend, in Mantua's court, Will make the blackest trait of barefac'd treason Seem fair and guiltless to thy partial eye. Bas. Nay, 'tis a weakness in thee, Rosinberg, Which makes thy mind so jealous and distrustful. Why should the duke be false? Ros. Because he is a double, crafty prince â Because I've heard it rumour'd secretly, That he in some dark treaty is engag'd, E'en with our master's enemy the Frank. Bas. And so thou thinkst â Ros. Nay, hear me to the end. Last night that good and honourable dame, Noble Albini, with most friendly art, From the gay clam'rous throng my steps beguil'd, Unmask'd before me, and with earnest grace Entreated me, if I were Basil's friend, To tell him hidden danger waits him here, And warn him earnestly this court to leave. She said she lov'd thee much; and hadst thou seen How anxiously she urg'dâ Bas. (interrupting him). By heav'n and earth, There is a ray of light breaks through thy tale, And I could leap like madmen in their freaks, So blessed is the gleam! Ah! no, no, no! It cannot be! alas, it cannot be! Yet didst thou say she urg'd it earnestly? She is a woman, who avoids all share In secret politics; one only charge Her int'rest claims, Victoria's guardian friend â And she would have me hence â it must be so. O! would it were! how saidst thou, gentle Rosinberg? She urg'd it earnestly â how did she urge it? Nay, pri'thee do not stare upon me thus, But tell me all her words. What said she else? Ros. O Basil! I could laugh to see thy folly, But that thy weakness doth provoke me so. Most admirable, brave, determin'd man! So well, so lately tried, what art thou now? A vain deceitful thought transports thee thus. Thinkst thou â Bas. I will not tell thee what I think. Ros. But I can guess it well, and it deceives thee. Leave this detested place, this fatal court, Where dark deceitful cunning plots thy ruin. A soldier's duty calls thee loudly hence. The time is critical. How wilt thou feel When they shall tell these tidings in thine ear, That brave Pescara and his royal troops, Our valiant fellows, have the en'my fought, Whilst we, so near at hand, lay loit'ring here? Bas. Thou dost disturb thy brain with fancied fears. Our fortunes rest not on a point so nice, That one short day should be of all this moment; And yet this one short day will be to me Worth years of other time. Ros. Nay, rather say, A day to darken all thy days beside. Confound the fatal beauty of that woman, Which hath bewitch'd thee so! Bas. 'Tis most ungen'rous To push me thus with rough unsparing hand, Where but the slightest touch is felt so dearly. It is unfriendly. Ros. God knows my heart! I would not give thee pain; But it disturbs me, Basil, vexes me, To see thee so enthralled by a woman. If she be fair, others are fair as she. Some other face will like emotions raise, When thou canst better play a lover's part: But for the present, â fie upon it, Basil! Bas. What, is it possible thou hast beheld, Hast tarried by her too, her converse shar'd, Yet talkst as though she were a common fair one, Such as a man may fancy and forget? Thou art not, sure, so dull and brutish grown: It is not so; thou dost belie thy thoughts, And vainly try'st to gain me with the cheat. Ros. So thinks each lover of the maid he loves, Yet, in their lives, some many maidens love. Fie on it! leave this town, and be a soldier! Bas. Have done, have done! why dost thou bait me thus? Thy words become disgusting to me, Rosinberg. What claim hast thou my actions to control? I'll Mantua leave when it is fit I should. Ros. Then, 'faith! 'tis fitting thou shouldst leave it now; Ay, on the instant. Is't not desperation To stay and hazard ruin on thy fame, Though yet uncheer'd e'en by that tempting lure, No lover breathes without? thou hast no hope. Bas. What, dost thou mean â curse on the paltry thought! That I should count and bargain with my heart, Upon the chances of unstinted favour, As little souls their base-bred fancies feed? O! were I conscious that within her breast I held some portion of her dear regard, Though pent for life within a prison's walls, Where through my grate I yet might sometimes see E'en but her shadow sporting in the sun; Though plac'd by fate where some obstructing bound, Some deep impassable between us roll'd, And I might yet from some high tow'ring cliff Perceive her distant mansion from afar, Or mark its blue smoke rising eve and morn; Nay, though within the circle of the moon Some spell did fix her, never to return, And I might wander in the hours of night, And upward turn my ever-gazing eye, Fondly to mark upon its varied disk Some little spot that might her dwelling be; My fond, my fixed heart would still adore, And own no other love. Away, away! How canst thou say to one who loves like me, Thou hast no hope? Ros. But with such hope, my friend, how stand thy fears? Are they so well refin'd? how wilt thou bear Ere long to hear, that some high-favour'd prince Has won her heart, her hand, has married her? Though now unshackled, will it always be? Bas. By heav'n thou dost contrive but to torment, And hast a pleasure in the pain thou giv'st! There is malignity in what thou sayst. Ros. No, not malignity, but kindness, Basil, That fain would save thee from the yawning gulf, To which blind passion guides thy heedless steps. Bas. Go, rather save thyself From the weak passion which has seiz'd thy breast, T' assume authority with sage-like brow, And shape my actions by thine own caprice. I can direct myself. Ros. Yes, do thyself, And let no artful woman do it for thee. Bas. I scorn thy thought: it is beneath my scorn: It is of meanness sprung â an artful woman! O! she has all the loveliness of heav'n, And all its goodness too! Ros. I mean not to impute dishonest arts, I mean not to impute â Bas. No, 'faith, thou canst not. Ros. What, can I not? their arts all women have. But now of this no more; it moves thee greatly. Yet once again, as a most loving friend, Let me conjure thee, if thou prizest honour, A soldier's fair repute, a hero's fame, What noble spirits love, and well I know Full dearly dost thou prize them, leave this place, And give thy soldiers orders for the march. Bas. Nay, since thou must assume it o'er me thus, Be gen'ral, and command my soldiers too. Ros. What, hath this passion in so short a space, O! curses on it! so far chang'd thee, Basil, That thou dost take with such ungentle warmth, The kindly freedom of thine ancient friend? Methinks the beauty of a thousand maids Would not have mov'd me thus to treat my friend, My best, mine earliest friend! Bas. Say kinsman rather; chance has link'd us so: Our blood is near, our hearts are sever'd far; No act of choice did e'er unite our souls. Men most unlike we are; our thoughts unlike; My breast disowns thee â thou'rt no friend of mine. Ros. Ah! have I then so long, so dearly lov'd thee; So often, with an elder brother's care, Thy childish rambles tended, shar'd thy sports; Fill'd up by stealth thy weary school-boy's task; Taught thy young arms thine earliest feats of strength; With boastful pride thine early rise beheld In glory's paths, contented then to fill A second place, so I might serve with thee; And sayst thou now, I am no friend of thine? Well, be it so; I am thy kinsman then, And by that title will I save thy name From danger of disgrace. Indulge thy will. I'll lay me down and feign that I am sick: And yet I shall not feign â I shall not feign; For thy unkindness makes me so indeed. It will be said that Basil tarried here To save his friend, for so they'll call me still; Nor will dishonour fall upon thy name For such a kindly deed.â [Basil walks up and down in great agitation, then stops, covers his face with his hands, and seems to be overcome. Rosinberg looks at him earnestly. O! blessed heav'n, he weeps! [Runs up to him, and catches him in his arms. O Basil! I have been too hard upon thee. And is it possible I've mov'd thee thus? Bas. (in a convulsed broken voice). I will renounce â I'll leave â Ros. What says my Basil? Bas. I'll Mantua leave â I'll leave this seat of bliss â This lovely woman â tear my heart in twain â Cast off at once my little span of joy â Be wretched â miserable â whate'er thou wilt â Dost thou forgive me? Ros. O my friend! my friend! I love thee now more than I ever lov'd thee. I must be cruel to thee to be kind: Each pang I see thee feel strikes through my heart; Then spare us both, call up thy noble spirit, And meet the blow at once. Thy troops are ready â Let us depart, nor lose another hour. [Basil shrinks from his arms, and looks at him with somewhat of an upbraiding, at the same time a sorrowful look. Bas. Nay, put me not to death upon the instant; I'll see her once again, and then depart. Ros. See her but once again, and thou art ruin'd! It must not be â if thou regardest me â Bas. Well then, it shall not be. Thou hast no mercy! Ros. Ah! thou wilt bless me all thine after-life For what now seems to thee so merciless. Bas. (sitting down very dejectedly). Mine after-life! what is mine after-life? My day is clos'd! the gloom of night is come! A hopeless darkness settles o'er my fate. I've seen the last look of her heavenly eyes; I've heard the last sounds of her blessed voice; I've seen her fair form from my sight depart: My doom is clos'd! Ros. (hanging over him with pity and affection). Alas! my friend! Bas. In all her lovely grace she disappear'd, Ah! little thought I never to return! Ros. Why so desponding? think of warlike glory. The fields of fair renown are still before thee; Who would not burn such noble fame to earn? Bas. What now are arms, or fair renown to me? Strive for it those who will â and yet, a while, Welcome rough war; with all thy scenes of blood; [Starting from his seat. Thy roaring thunders, and thy clashing steel! Welcome once more! what have I now to do But play the brave man o'er again, and die? Enter Isabella. Isab. (to Bas.) My princess bids me greet you, noble count â Bas. (starting). What dost thou say? Ros. Damn this untimely message! Isab. The princess bids me greet you, noble count: In the cool grove, hard by the southern gate, She with her train â Bas. What, she indeed, herself? Isab. Herself, my lord, and she requests to see you. Bas. Thank heav'n for this! I will be there anon. Ros. (taking hold of him). Stay, stay, and do not be a madman still. Bas. Let go thy hold: what, must I be a brute, A very brute to please thee? no, by heav'n! [Breaks from him, and Exit. Ros. (striking his forehead). All lost again! ill fortune light upon her! [Turning eagerly to Isab. And so thy virtuous mistress sends thee here To make appointments, honourable dame? Isab. Not so, my lord, you must not call it so: The court will hunt to-morrow, and Victoria Would have your noble gen'ral of her train. Ros. Confound these women, and their artful snares, Since men will be such fools! Isab. Yes, grumble at our empire as you will â Ros. What, boast ye of it? empire do ye call it? It is your shame! a short-liv'd tyranny, That ends at last in hatred and contempt. Isab. Nay, but some women do so wisely rule, Their subjects never from the yoke escape. Ros. Some women do, but they are rarely found. There is not one in all your paltry court Hath wit enough for the ungen'rous task. 'Faith! of you all, not one, but brave Albini, And she disdains it â Good be with you, lady! [Going. Isab. O would I could but touch that stubborn heart, How dearly should he pay for this hour's scorn! [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. A summer apartment in the country, the windows of which look to a forest. Enter Victoria in a hunting dress, followed by Albini and Isabella, speaking as they enter. Vict. (to Alb.) And so you will not share our sport to-day? Alb. My days of frolic should ere this be o'er, But thou, my charge, hast kept me youthful still. I should most gladly go; but, since the dawn, A heavy sickness hangs upon my heart; I cannot hunt to-day. Vict. I'll stay at home and nurse thee, dear Albini. Alb. No, no, thou shalt not stay. Vict. Nay, but I will. I cannot follow to the cheerful horn, Whilst thou art sick at home. Alb. Not very sick. Rather than thou shouldst stay, my gentle child, I'll mount my horse, and go e'en as I am. Vict. Nay, then I'll go, and soon return again. Meanwhile, do thou be careful of thyself. Isab. Hark, hark! the shrill horns call us to the field: Your highness hears it? [Music without, Vict. Yes, my Isabella; I hear it, and methinks e'en at the sound I vault already on my leathern seat, And feel the fiery steed beneath me shake His mantled sides, and paw the fretted earth; Whilst I aloft, with gay equestrian grace, The low salute of gallant lords return, Who, waiting round with eager watchful eye, And reined steeds, the happy moment seize. O! didst thou never hear, my Isabell, How nobly Basil in the field becomes His fiery courser's back? Isab. They say most gracefully. Alb. What, is the valiant count not yet departed? Vict. You would not have our gallant Basil go When I have bid him stay? not so, Albini. Alb. Fie! reigns that spirit still so strongly in thee, Which vainly covets all men's admiration, And is to others cause of cruel pain? O! would thou couldst subdue it! Vict. My gentle friend, thou shouldst not be severe: For now in truth I love not admiration As I was wont to do; in truth I do not. But yet, this once, my woman's heart excuse, For there is something strange in this man's love, I never met before, and I must prove it. Alb. Well, prove it then, be stricken too thyself, And bid sweet peace of mind a sad farewell. Vict. O no! that rather will my peace restore: For after this, all folly of the kind Will quite insipid and disgusting seem; And so I shall become a prudent maid, And passing wise at last. [Music heard without. Hark, hark! again! All good be with you! I'll return ere long. [Exeunt Victoria and Isabella. Alb. (sola.) Ay, go, and ev'ry blessing with thee go, My most tormenting and most pleasing charge! Like vapour from the mountain stream art thou, Which lightly rises on the morning air, And shifts its fleeting form with ev'ry breeze, For ever varying, and for ever graceful. Endearing, gen'rous, bountiful and kind; Vain, fanciful, and fond of worthless praise; Courteous and gentle, proud and magnificent: And yet these adverse qualities in thee, No dissonance, nor striking contrast make; For still thy good and amiable gifts The sober dignity of virtue wear not, And such a 'witching mien thy follies show, They make a very idiot of reproof, And smile it to disgrace.â What shall I do with thee?âIt grieves me much To hear Count Basil is not yet departed. When from the chace he comes, I'll watch his steps, And speak to him myself.â O! I could hate her for that poor ambition, Which silly adoration only claims, But that I well remember in my youth I felt the like â I did not feel it long: I tore it soon indignant from my breast, As that which did degrade a noble mind. [Exit. SCENE V. A very beautiful grove in the forest. Music and horns heard afar off, whilst huntsmen and dogs appear passing over the stage, at a great distance. Enter Victoria and Basil, as if just alighted from their horses. Vict. (speaking to attendants without). Lead on our horses to the further grove, And wait us there.â (To Bas.) This spot so pleasing and so fragrant is, 'Twere sacrilege with horses' hoofs to wear Its velvet turf, where little elfins dance, And fairies sport beneath the summer's moon: I love to tread upon it. Bas. O! I would quit the chariot of a god For such delightful footing! Vict. I love this spot. Bas. It is a spot where one would live and die. Vict. See, through the twisted boughs of those high elms, The sun-beams on the bright'ning foliage play, And tinge the scaled bark with ruddy brown. Is it not beautiful? Bas. 'Tis passing beautiful, To see the sunbeams on the foliage play, (in a soft voice). And tinge the scaled bark with ruddy brown. Vict. And here I've stood full often, and admir'd The graceful bending, o'er that shady pool, Of you green willow, whose fair sweepy boughs So kiss their image on the glassy plain, And bathe their leafy tresses in the stream. Bas. And I too love to see its drooping boughs So kiss their image on the glassy plain, And bathe their leafy tresses in the stream. Vict. My lord, it is uncivil in you thus My very words with mock'ry to repeat. Bas. Nay, pardon me, did I indeed repeat? I meant it not; but when I hear thee speak, So sweetly dwells thy voice upon mine ear, My tongue e'en unawares assumes the tone; As mothers on their lisping infants gaze, And catch their broken words. I pri'thee, pardon! Vict. But we must leave this grove: the birds fly low: This should forebode a storm, and yet o'erhead The sky, bespread with little downy clouds Of purest white, would seem to promise peace. How beautiful those pretty snowy clouds! Bas. Of a most dazzling brightness! Vict. Nay, nay, a veil that tempers heav'n's brightness, Of softest, purest white. Bas. As though an angel, in his upward flight, Had left his mantle floating in mid air. Vict. Still most unlike a garment; small and sever'd: [Turning round, and perceiving that he is gazing at her. But thou regardst them not. Bas. Ah! what should I regard, where should I gaze? For in that far-shot glance, so keenly wak'd, That sweetly rising smile of admiration, Far better do I learn how fair heav'n is, Than if I gaz'd upon the blue serene. Vict. Remember you have promis'd, gentle count, No more to vex me with such foolish words. Bas. Ah! wherefore should my tongue alone be mute? When every look and every motion tell, So plainly tell, and will not be forbid, That I adore thee, love thee, worship thee! [Victoria looks haughty and displeased. Ah! pardon me, I know not what I say. Ah! frown not thus! I cannot see thee frown. I'll do whate'er thou wilt, I will be silent: But, O! a reined tongue, and bursting heart, Are hard at once to bear.âWilt thou forgive me? Vict. We'll think no more of it; we'll quit this spot; I do repent me that I led thee here. But 'twas the fav'rite path of a dear friend; Here many a time we wander'd, arm in arm; We lov'd this grove, and now that he is absent, I love to haunt it still. [Basil starts. Bas. His fav'rite pathâa friendâhere arm in armâ (Clasping his hands, and raising them to his head). Then there is such an one! (Drooping his head, and looking distractedly upon the ground). I dream'd not of it. Vict. (pretending not to see him). That little lane, with woodbine all o'ergrown, He lov'd so well!âit is a fragrant path, Is it not, count? Bas. It is a gloomy one! Vict. I have, my lord, been wont to think it cheerful. Bas. I thought your highness meant to leave this spot? Vict. I do, and by this lane we'll take our way; For here he often walk'd with saunt'ring pace, And listen'd to the woodlark's evening song. Bas. What, must I on his very footsteps go? Accursed be the ground on which he trode! Vict. And is Count Basil so uncourtly grown, That he would curse my brother to my face? Bas. Your brother! gracious God! is it your brother? That dear, that loving friend of whom you spoke, Is he indeed your brother? Vict. He is, indeed, my lord. Bas. Then heaven bless him! all good angels bless him! I could weep o'er him now, shed blood for him! I couldâO what a foolish heart have I! [Walks up and down with a hurried step, tossing about his arms in transport; then stops short, and runs up to Victoria. Is it indeed your brother? Vict. It is indeed: what thoughts disturb'd thee so? Bas. I will not tell thee; foolish thoughts they were. Heav'n bless your brother! Vict. Ay, heav'n bless him too! I have but him; would I had two brave brothers, And thou wert one of them! Bas. I would fly from thee to earth's utmost bounds, Were I thy brotherâ And yet, methinks, I would I had a sister. Vict. And wherefore would ye so? Bas. To place her near thee, The soft companion of thy hours to prove, And, when far distant, sometimes talk of me. Thou couldst not chide a gentle sister's cares. Perhaps, when rumour from the distant war, Uncertain tales of dreadful slaughter bore, Thou'dst see the tear hang on her pale wan cheek, And kindly say, How does it fare with Basil? Vict. No more of thisâindeed there must no more. A friend's remembrance I will ever bear thee. But see where Isabella this way comes: I had a wish to speak with her alone; Attend us here, for soon will we return, And then take horse again. [Exit. Bas. (looking after her for some time). See with what graceful steps she moves along, Her lovely form, in ev'ry action lovely! If but the wind her ruffled garment raise, It twists it into some light pretty fold, Which adds new grace. Or should some small mishap, Some tangling branch, her fair attire derange, What would in others strange or awkward seem, But lends to her some wild bewitching charm. See, yonder does she raise her lovely arm To pluck the dangling hedge-flow'r as she goes; And now she turns her head, as though she view'd The distant landscape; now methinks she walks With doubtful ling'ring stepsâwill she look back? Ah, no! you thicket hides her from my sight. Bless'd are the eyes that may behold her still, Nor dread that ev'ry look shall be the last! And yet she said she would remember me. I will believe it: Ah! I must believe it, Or be the saddest soul that sees the light! But, lo, a messenger, and from the army! He brings me tidings; grant they may be good! Till now I never fear'd what man might utter; I dread his tale, God grant it may be good! Enter Messenger. From the army? Mess. Yes, my lord. Bas. What tidings bringst thou? Mess. Th' imperial army, under brave Pescara, Has beat the enemy near Pavia's walls. Bas. Ha! have they fought? and is the battle o'er? Mess. Yes, conquer'd; ta'en the French king prisoner, Who, like a noble, gallant gentleman, Fought to the last, nor yielded up his sword Till, being one amidst surrounding foes, His arm could do no more. Bas. What dost thou say? who is made pris'ner? What king did fight so well? Mess. The king of France. Bas. Thou saidstâthy words do ring so in mine ears, I cannot catch their senseâthe battle's o'er? Mess. It is, my lord. Pescara staid your coming, But could no longer stay. His troops were bold, Occasion press'd him, and they bravely foughtâ They bravely fought, my lord! Bas. I hear, I hear thee. Accurs'd am I, that it should wring my heart To hear they bravely fought!â They bravely fought, while we lay ling'ring here. O! what a fated blow to strike me thus! Perdition! shame! disgrace! a damned blow! Mess. Ten thousand of the enemy are slain; We too have lost full many a gallant soul. I view'd the closing armies from afar; Their close pik'd ranks in goodly order spread, Which seem'd, alas! when that the fight was o'er, Like the wild marsh's crop of stately reeds, Laid with the passing storm. But woe is me! When to the field I came, what dismal sights! What waste of life! what heaps of bleeding slain! Bas. Would I were laid a red, disfigur'd corse, Amid those heaps! They fought, and we were absent! [Walks about distractedly, then stops short. Who sent thee here? Mess. Pescara sent me to inform Count Basil, He needs not now his aid, and gives him leave To march his tardy troops to distant quarters. Bas. He says so, does he? well, it shall be so. [Tossing his arms distractedly. I will to quarters, narrow quarters go, Where voice of war shall rouse me forth no more. [Exit. Mess. I'll follow after him; he is distracted:â And yet he looks so wild, I dare not do it. Enter Victoria, as if frightened, followed by Isabella. Vict. (to Isab.) Didst thou not mark him as he pass'd thee too? Isab. I saw him pass, but with such hasty steps I had no time. Vict. I met him with a wild disorder'd air, In furious haste; he stopp'd distractedly, And gaz'd upon me with a mournful look, But pass'd away, and spoke not. Who art thou? (To the messenger). I fear thou art a bearer of bad tidings. Mess. No, rather good, as I should deem it, madam, Although unwelcome tidings to Count Basil. Our army hath a glorious battle won; Ten thousand French are slain, their monarch captive. Vict. (to Mess). Ah, there it is! he was not in the fight. Run after him I prayânay, do not soâ Run to his kinsman, good Count Rosinberg, And bid him follow himâI pray thee run! Mess. Nay, lady, by your leave, you seem not well; I will conduct you hence, and then I'll go. Vict. No, no, I'm well enough; I'm very well; Go, hie thee hence, and do thine errand swiftly. [Exit messenger. O what a wretch am I! I am to blame! I only am to blame! Isab. Nay, wherefore say so? What have you done that others would not do? Vict. What have I done? I've fool'd a noble heartâ I've wreck'd a brave man's honour! [Exit, leaning upon Isabella. ACT V. SCENE I. A dark night; no moon; but a few stars glimmering; the stage represents (as much as can be discovered for the darkness) a churchyard with part of a chapel, and a wing of the ducal palace adjoining to it. Enter Basil, with his hat off, his hair and his dress in disorder, stepping slowly, and stopping several times to listen, as if he was afraid of meeting any one. Bas. No sound is here: man is at rest, and I May near his habitations venture forth, Like some unblessed creature of the night, Who dares not meet his face.âHer window's dark; No streaming light doth from her chamber beam, That I once more may on her dwelling gaze, And bless her still. All now is dark for me! [Pauses for some time, and looks upon the graves. How happy are the dead, who quietly rest Beneath these stones! each by his kindred laid, Still in a hallow'd neighbourship with those, Who when alive his social converse shar'd: And now perhaps some dear surviving friend Doth here at times the grateful visit pay, Read with sad eyes his short memorial o'er, And bless his mem'ry still!â But I must like an outcast of my kind, In some lone spot lay my unburied corse, To rot above the earth; where, if perchance The steps of human wand'rer e'er approach, He'll stand aghast, and flee the horrid place, With dark imaginations frightful made,â The haunt of damned sprites. O cursed wretch! I' the fair and honour'd field shouldst thou have died, Where brave friends, proudly smiling through their tears, Had pointed out the spot where Basil lay! [A light seen in Victoria's window. But, ha! the wonted, welcome light appears. How bright within I see her chamber wall! Athwart it too, a dark'ning shadow moves, A slender woman's form: it is herself! What means that motion of its clasped hands? That drooping head? alas! is she in sorrow? Alas! thou sweet enchantress of the mind, Whose voice was gladness, and whose presence bliss, Art thou unhappy too? I've brought thee woe; It is for me thou weepst. Ah! were it so, Fallen as I am, I yet could life endure, In some dark den from human sight conceal'd, So, that I sometimes from my haunt might steal, To see and love thee still. No, no, poor wretch! She weeps thy shame, she weeps, and scorns thee too. She moves again; e'en darkly imag'd thus, How lovely is that form! [Pauses, still looking at the window. To be so near thee, and for ever parted! For ever lost! what art thou now to me? Shall the departed gaze on thee again? Shall I glide past thee in the midnight hour, While thou perceiv'st it not, and thinkst perhaps 'Tis but the mournful breeze that passes by? [Pauses again, and gazes at the window, till the light disappears. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone! these eyes have seen their last! The last impression of her heavenly form The last sight of those walls wherein she lives: The last blest ray of light from human dwelling. I am no more a being of this world. Farewell! farewell! all now is dark for me! Come fated deed! come horror and despair! Here lies my dreadful way. Enter Geoffry, from behind a tomb. Geof. O! stay, my gen'ral! Bas. Art thou from the grave? Geof. O, my brave gen'ral! do you know me not? I am old Geoffry, the old maimed soldier, You did so nobly honour. Bas. Then go thy way, for thou art honourable; Thou hast no shame, thou needst not seek the dark Like fallen, fameless men. I pray thee go! Geof. Nay, speak not thus, my noble gen'ral! Ah! speak not thus! thou'rt brave, thou'rt honour'd still. Thy soldier's fame is far too surely rais'd To be o'erthrown with one unhappy chance. I've heard of thy brave deeds with swelling heart, And yet shall live to cast my cap in air At glorious tales of thee.â Bas. Forbear, forbear! thy words but wring my soul. Geof. O! pardon me! I am old maimed Geoffry. O! do not go! I've but one hand to hold thee. [Laying hold of Basil as he attempts to go away. Basil stops, and looks round upon him with softness. Bas. Two would not hold so well, old honour'd vet'ran! What wouldst thou have me do? Geof. Return, my lord; for love of blessed heaven, Seek not such desperate ways! where would you go? Bas. Does Geoffry ask where should a soldier go To hide disgrace? there is no place but one. [Struggling to get free. Let go thy foolish hold, and force me not To do some violence to thy hoary headâ What, wilt thou not? nay, then it must be so. [Breaks violently from him, and Exit. Geof. Curs'd feeble hand! he's gone to seek perdition! I cannot run. Where is that stupid hind? He should have met me here. Holla, Fernando! Enter Fernando. We've lost him, he is gone, he's broke from me! Did I not bid thee meet me early here, For that he has been known to haunt this place? Fer. And which way has he gone? Geof. Towards the forest, if I guess aright. But do thou run with speed to Rosinberg, And he will follow him: run swiftly, man! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A wood, wild and savage; an entry to a cave, very much tangled with brushwood, is seen in the background. The time represents the dawn of morning. Basil is discovered standing near the front of the stage in a thoughtful posture, with a couple of pistols laid by him on a piece of projecting rock; he pauses for some time. Bas. (alone). What shall I be some few short moments hence? Why ask I now? who from the dead will rise To tell me of that awful state unknown? But be it what it may, or bliss or torment, Annihilation, dark and endless rest, Or some dread thing, man's wildest range of thought Hath never yet conceiv'd, that change I'll dare Which makes me any thing but what I am. I can bear scorpions' stings, tread fields of fire, In frozen gulfs of cold eternal lie, Be toss'd aloft through tracts of endless void, But cannot live in shame.â(Pauses). O impious thought! Will the great God of mercy, mercy have On all but those who are most miserable? Will he not punish with a pitying hand The poor, fall'n, froward child? (Pauses.) And shall I then against His will offend, Because He is most good and merciful? O! horrid baseness? what, what shall I do? I'll think no moreâit turns my dizzy brainâ It is too late to thinkâwhat must be, must beâ I cannot live, therefore I needs must die. [Takes up the pistols, and walks up and down, looking wildly around him, then discovering the cave's mouth. Here is an entry to some darksome cave, Where an uncoffin'd corse may rest in peace, And hide its foul corruption from the earth. The threshold is unmark'd by mortal foot. I'll do it here. [Enters the cave and Exit; a deep silence; then the report of a pistol is heard from the cave, and soon after, enter Rosinberg, Valtomer, two officers and soldiers, almost at the same moment, by different sides of the stage. Ros. This way the sound did come. Valt. How came ye, soldiers? heard ye that report? 1st Sol. We heard it, and it seem'd to come from hence, Which made us this way hie. Ros. A horrid fancy darts across my mind. [A groan heard from the cave. (To Valt.) Ha! heardst thou that? Valt. Methinks it is the groan of one in pain. [A second groan. Ros. Ha! there again! Valt. From this cave's mouth, so dark and chok'd with weeds, It seems to come. Ros. I'll enter first. 1st Off. My lord, the way is tangled o'er with briers: Hard by a few short paces to the left, There is another mouth of easier access; I pass'd it even now. Ros. Then show the way. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The inside of the cave. Basil discovered lying on the ground, with his head raised a little upon a few stones and earth, the pistols lying beside him, and blood upon his breast. Enter Rosinberg, Valtomer, and officers. Rosinberg, upon seeing Basil, stops short with horror, and remains motionless for some time. Valt. Great God of heaven! what a sight is this! [Rosinberg runs to Basil, and stoops down by his side. Ros. O Basil! O my friend! what hast thou done? Bas. (covering his face with his hand). Why art thou come? I thought to die in peace. Ros. Thou knowst me notâI am thy Rosinberg, Thy dearest, truest friend, thy loving kinsman! Thou dost not say to me, Why art thou come? Bas. Shame knows no kindred: I am fall'n, disgrac'd; My fame is gone, I cannot look upon thee. Ros. My Basil, noble spirit! talk not thus! The greatest mind untoward fate may prove: Thou art our gen'rous, valiant leader still, Fall'n as thou artâand yet thou art not fall'n; Who says thou art, must put his harness on, And prove his words in blood. Bas. Ah, Rosinberg! this is no time to boast! I once had hopes a glorious name to gain; Too proud of heart, I did too much aspire; The hour of trial came, and found me wanting. Talk not of me, but let me be forgotten.â And O! my friend! something upbraids me here, [Laying his hand on his breast. For that I now remember how ofttimes I have usurp'd it o'er thy better worth, Most vainly teaching where I should have learnt: But thou wilt pardon me.â Ros. (taking Basil' s hand, and pressing it to his breast). Rend not my heart in twain! O! talk not thus! I knew thou wert superior to myself, And to all men beside: thou wert my pride; I paid thee def'rence with a willing heart. Bas. It was delusion, all delusion, Rosinberg! I feel my weakness now, I own my pride. Give me thy hand, my time is near the close: Do this for me: thou knowst my love, Victoriaâ Ros. O curse that woman! she it is aloneâ She has undone us all! Bas. It doubles unto me the stroke of death To hear thee name her thus. O curse her not! The fault is mine; she's gentle, good and blamelessâ Thou wilt not then my dying wish fulfil? Ros. I will! I will! what wouldst thou have me do? Bas. See her when I am gone; be gentle with her; And tell her that I bless'd her in my death; E'en in my agonies I lov'd and bless'd her. Wilt thou do this?â Ros. I'll do what thou desir'st Bas. I thank thee, Rosinberg; my time draws near. [Raising his head a little, and perceiving officers. Is there not some one here? are we alone? Ros. (making a sign for the officers to retire). 'Tis but a sentry, to prevent intrusion. Bas. Thou knowst this desp'rate deed from sacred rites Hath shut me out: I am unbless'd of men, And what I am in sight of th' awful God, I dare not think; when I am gone, my friend, O! let a good man's prayers to heav'n ascend For an offending spirit!âPray for me. What thinkest thou? although an outcast here, May not some heavenly mercy still be found? Ros. Thou wilt find mercyâmy beloved Basilâ It cannot be that thou shouldst be rejected. I will with bended kneeâI will imploreâ It chokes mine utteranceâI will pray for theeâ Bas. This comforts meâthou art a loving friend. [A noise without. Ros. (to off. without). What noise is that? Enter Valtomer. Valt. (to Ros.) My lord, the soldiers all insist to enter. What shall I do? they will not be denied: They say that they will see their noble gen'ral. Bas. Ah, my brave fellows! do they call me so? Ros. Then let them come. [Enter soldiers, who gather round Basil, and look mournfully upon him; he holds out his hand to them with a faint smile. Bas. My gen'rous soldiers, this is kindly meant. I'm low i' the dust; God bless you all, brave hearts! 1st Sol. And God bless you, my noble, noble gen'ral! We'll never follow such a leader more. 2nd Sol. Ah! had you staid with us, my noble gen'ral, We would have died for you. [3d soldier endeavours next to speak, but cannot; and kneeling down by Basil, covers his face with his cloak. Rosinberg turns his face to the wall and weeps. Bas. (in a very faint broken voice). Where art thou? do not leave me, Rosinbergâ Come near to meâthese fellows make me weep: I have no power to weepâgive me thy handâ I love to feel thy graspâmy heart beats strangelyâ It beats as though its breathings would be fewâ Rememberâ Ros. Is there aught thou wouldst desire? Bas. Nought but a little earth to cover me, And lay the smooth sod even with the groundâ Let no stone mark the spotâgive no offence. I fain would sayâwhat can I say to thee? [A deep pause; after a feeble struggle, Basil expires. 1st Sol. That motion was his last. 2nd Sol. His spirit's fled. 1st Sol. God grant it peace! it was a noble spirit! 4th Sol. The trumpet's sound did never rouse a braver. 1st Sol. Alas! no trumpet e'er shall rouse him more, Until the dreadful blast that wakes the dead. 2nd Sol. And when that sounds it will not wake a braver. 3d Sol. How pleasantly he shar'd our hardest toil! Our coarsest food the daintiest fare he made. 4th Sol. Ay, many a time i' the cold damp plain has he With cheerful count'nance cried, âGood rest, my hearts!â Then wrapp'd him in his cloak, and laid him down E'en like the meanest soldier in the field. [Rosinberg all this time continues hanging over the body, and gazing upon it. Valtomer now endeavours to draw him away. Valt. This is too sad, my lord. Ros. There, seest thou how he lies? so fix'd, so pale! Ah! what an end is this! thus lost! thus fall'n! To be thus taken in his middle course, Where he so nobly strove; till cursed passion Came like a sun-stroke on his mid-day toil, And cut the strong man down. O Basil! Basil! Valt. Forbear, my friend, we must not sorrow here. Ros. He was the younger brother of my soul. Valt. Indeed, my lord, it is too sad a sight. Time calls us, let the body be remov'd. Ros. He wasâO! he was like no other man! Valt. (still endeavouring to draw him away). Nay, now forbear. Ros. I lov'd him from his birth! Valt. Time presses, let the body be remov'd. Ros. What sayst thou? Valt. Shall we not remove him hence? Ros. He has forbid it, and has charg'd me well To leave his grave unknown? for that the church All sacred rites to the self-slain denies. He would not give offence. 1st Sol. What! shall our gen'ral, like a very wretch, Be laid unhonour'd in the common ground? No last salute to bid his soul farewell? No warlike honours paid? it shall not be. 2nd Sol. Laid thus? no, by the blessed light of heav'n! In the most holy spot in Mantua's walls He shall be laid; in face of day be laid: And though black priests should curse us in the teeth, We will fire o'er him whilst our hands have power To grasp a musket. Several soldiers. Let those who dare forbid it! Ros. My brave companions, be it as you will. [Spreading out his arms as if he would embrace the soldiers.âThey prepare to remove the body. Valt. Nay, stop a while, we will not move it now, For see a mournful visitor appears, And must not be denied. Enter Victoria and Isabella. Vict. I though to find him here; where has he fled? [Rosinberg points to the body without speaking; Victoria shrieks out and falls into the arms of Isabella. Isab. Alas! my gentle mistress, this will kill thee. Vict. (recovering). Unloose thy hold, and let me look upon him. O! horrid, horrid sight! my ruin'd Basil! Is this the sad reward of all thy love? O! I have murder'd thee! [Kneels down by the body, and bends over it. These wasted streams of life! this bloody wound! [Laying her hand upon his heart. Is there no breathing here? all still! all cold! Open thine eyes, speak, be thyself again, And I will love thee, serve thee, follow thee, In spite of all reproach. Alas! alas! A lifeless corse art thou for ever laid, And dost not hear my call. Ros. No, madam; now your pity comes too late. Vict. Dost thou upbraid me? O! I have deserv'd it! Ros. No, madam, no, I will not now upbraid: But woman's grief is like a summer storm, Short as it violent is; in gayer scenes, Where soon thou shalt in giddy circles blaze, And play the airy goddess of the day, Thine eye, perchance, amidst th' observing crowd, Shall mark th' indignant face of Basil's friend, And then it will upbraid. Vict. No, never, never! thus it shall not be. To the dark, shaded cloister wilt thou go, Where sad and lonely, through the dismal grate Thou'lt spy my wasted form, and then upbraid me. Ros. Forgive me, heed me not; I'm griev'd at heart; I'm fretted, gall'd, all things are hateful to me. If thou didst love my friend, I will forgive thee; I must forgive thee: with his dying breath He bade me tell thee, that his latest thoughts Were love to thee; in death he lov'd and bless'd thee. [Victoria goes to throw herself upon the body, but is prevented by Valtomer and Isabella, who support her in their arms, and endeavour to draw her away from it. Vict. Oh! force me not away! by his cold corse Let me lie down and weep. O! Basil, Basil! The gallant and the brave! how hast thou lov'd me! If there is any holy kindness in you, [To Isab. and Valt. Tear me not hence. For he lov'd me in thoughtless folly lost, With all my faults, most worthless of his love; And him I'll love in the low bed of death, In horror and decay.â Near his lone tomb I'll spend my wretched days In humble pray'r for his departed spirit: Cold as his grave shall be my earthy bed, As dark my cheerless cell. Force me not hence. I will not go, for grief hath made me strong. [Struggling to get loose. Ros. Do not withhold her, leave her sorrow free. [They let her go, and she throws herself upon the body in an agony of grief. It doth subdue the sternness of my grief To see her mourn him thus.âYet I must curse.â Heav'n's curses light upon her damned father, Whose crooked policy has wrought this wreck! Isab. If he has done it, you are well reveng'd, For all his hidden plots are now detected. Gauriecio, for some int'rest of his own, His master's secret dealings with the foe Has to Lannoy betray'd; who straight hath sent, On the behalf of his imperial lord, A message full of dreadful threats to Mantua. His discontented subjects aid him not; He must submit to the degrading terms A haughty conqu'ring power will now impose. Ros. And art thou sure of this? Isab. I am, my lord. Ros. Give me thy hand, I'm glad on't, O! I'm glad on't! It should be so! how like a hateful ape, Detected, grinning, 'midst his pilfer'd hoard, A cunning man appears, whose secret frauds Are open'd to the day! scorn'd, hooted, mock'd! Scorn'd by the very fools who most admir'd His worthless art. But when a great mind falls, The noble nature of man's gen'rous heart Doth bear him up against the shame of ruin; With gentle censure using but his faults As modest means to introduce his praise; For pity like a dewy twilight comes To close th' oppressive splendour of his day, And they who but admir'd him in his height, His alter'd state lament, and love him fallen. [Exeunt. DE MONFORT: A TRAGEDY. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN De Monfort. Rezenvelt. Count Freberg, friend to De Monfort and Rezenvelt. Manuel, servant to De Monfort. Jerome, De Monfort's old landlord. Conrad, an artful knave. Bernard, a monk. Monks, gentlemen, officers, page, &amp;c. &amp;c.WOMEN Jane De Monfort, sister to De Monfort. Countess Freberg, wife to Freberg. Theresa, servant to the Countess. Abbess, nuns, and a lay sister, ladies, &amp;c. Scene, a town in Germany. ACT I. SCENE I. Jerome's house. A large old-fashioned chamber. Jer. (speaking without). This way, good masters. Enter Jerome, bearing a light, and followed by Manuel, and servants carrying luggage. Rest your burthens here. This spacious room will please the marquis best. He takes me unawares; but ill prepar'd: If he had sent, e'en though a hasty notice, I had been glad. Man. Be not disturb'd, good Jerome; Thy house is in most admirable order; And they who travel o' cold winter nights Think homeliest quarters good. Jer. He is not far behind? Man. A little way. (To the servants.) Go you and wait below till he arrive. Jer. (shaking Manuel by the hand). Indeed, my friend, I'm glad to see you here; Yet marvel wherefore. Man. I marvel wherefore too, my honest Jerome: But here we are; pri'thee be kind to us. Jer. Most heartily I will. I love your master: He is a quiet and a lib'ral man: A better inmate never cross'd my door. Man. Ah! but he is not now the man he was. Lib'ral he'll be. God grant he may be quiet. Jer. What has befallen him? Man. I cannot tell thee; But, faith, there is no living with him now. Jer. And yet, methinks, if I remember well You were about to quit his service, Manuel, When last he left this house. You grumbled then. Man. I've been upon the eve of leaving him These ten long years; for many times he is So difficult, capricious, and distrustful, He galls my natureâyet, I know not how, A secret kindness binds me to him still. Jer. Some who offend from a suspicious nature, Will afterwards such fair confession make As turns e'en the offence into a favour. Man. Yes, some indeed do so; so will not he: He'd rather die than such confession make. Jer. Ay, thou art right; for now I call to mind That once he wrong'd me with unjust suspicion, When first he came to lodge beneath my roof; And when it so fell out that I was prov'd Most guiltless of the fault, I truly thought He would have made profession of regret. But silent, haughty, and ungraciously He bore himself as one offended still. Yet shortly after, when unwittingly I did him some slight service, o' the sudden He overpower'd me with his grateful thanks; And would not be restrain'd from pressing on me A noble recompense. I understood His o'erstrain'd gratitude and bounty well, And took it as he meant. Man. 'Tis often thus. I would have left him many years ago, But that with all his faults there sometimes come Such bursts of natural goodness from his heart, As might engage a harder churl than I To serve him still.âAnd then his sister too; A noble dame, who should have been a queen: The meanest of her hinds, at her command, Had fought like lions for her, and the poor, E'en o'er their bread of poverty, had bless'd herâ She would have griev'd if I had left my lord. Jer. Comes she along with him? Man. No, he departed all unknown to her, Meaning to keep conceal'd his secret route; But well I knew it would afflict her much, And therefore left a little nameless billet, Which after our departure, as I guess, Would fall into her hands, and tell her all. What could I do! O 'tis a noble lady! Jer. All this is strangeâsomething disturbs his mindâ Belike he is in love. Man. No, Jerome, no. Once on a time I serv'd a noble master, Whose youth was blasted with untoward love, And he, with hope and fear and jealousy For ever toss'd, led an unquiet life: Yet, when unruffled by the passing fit, His pale wan face such gentle sadness wore As mov'd a kindly heart to pity him. But Monfort, even in his clamest hour, Still bears that gloomy sternness in his eye Which powerfully repels all sympathy. O no! good Jerome, no, it is not love. Jer. Hear I not horses trampling at the gate? [Listening. He is arrived â stay thou â I had forgot â A plague upon't! my head is so confus'dâ I will return i' the instant to receive him. [Exit hastily. [A great bustle without. Exit Manuel with lights, and returns again, lighting in De Monfort, as if just alighted from his journey. Man. Your ancient host, my lord, receives you gladly, And your apartment will be soon prepar'd. De Mon. 'Tis well. Man. Where shall I place the chest you gave in charge? So please you, say, my lord. De Mon. (throwing himself into a chair). Wheree'er thou wilt. Man. I would not move that luggage till you came. [Pointing to certain things. De Mon. Move what thou wilt, and trouble me no more. [Manuel, with the assistance of other servants, sets about putting the things in order, and De Monfort remains sitting in a thoughtful posture). Enter Jerome, bearing wine, &amp;c. on a salver. As he approaches De Monfort, Manuel pulls him by the sleeve. Man. (aside to Jerome). No, do not now; he will not be disturb'd. Jer. What! not to bid him welcome to my house, And offer some refreshment? Man. No, good Jerome. Softly a little while: I pri'thee do. [Jerome walks softly on tiptoe, till he gets behind De Monfort, then peeping on one side to see his face. Jer. (aside to Manuel). Ah, Manuel, what an alter'd man is here! His eyes are hollow, and his cheeks are paleâ He left this house a comely gentleman. De Mon. Who whispers there? Man. 'Tis your old landlord, sir. Jer. I joy to see you hereâI crave your pardonâ I fear I do intrudeâ De Mon. No, my kind host, I am obliged to thee. Jer. How fares it with your honour? De Mon. Well enough. Jer. Here is a little of the fav'rite wine That you were wont to praise. Pray honour me. [Fills a glass. De Mon. (after drinking). I thank you, Jerome, 'tis delicious. Jer. Ay, my dear wife did ever make it so. De Mon. And how does she? Jer. Alas, my lord! she's dead. De Mon. Well, then she is at rest. Jer. How well, my lord? De Mon. Is she not with the dead, the quiet dead, Where all is peace? Not e'en the impious wretch, Who tears the coffin from its earthy vault, And strews the mould'ring ashes to the wind, Can break their rest. Jer. Woe's me! I thought you would have griev'd for her. She was a kindly soul! Before she died, When pining sickness bent her cheerless head, She set my house in orderâ And but the morning ere she breath'd her last, Bade me preserve some flaskets of this wine, That should the Lord de Monfort come again His cup might sparkle still. [De Monfort walks across the stage, and wipes his eyes. Indeed I fear I have distress'd you, sir; I surely thought you would be griev'd for her. De Mon. (taking Jerome's hand). I am, my friend. How long has she been dead? Jer. Two sad long years. De Mon. Would she were living still! I was too troublesome, too heedless of her. Jer. O no! she lov'd to serve you. [Loud knocking without. De Mon. What fool comes here, at such untimely hours, To make this cursed noise? (To Manuel.) Go to the gate. [Exit Manuel. All sober citizens are gone to bed; It is some drunkards on their nightly rounds, Who mean it but in sport. Jer. I hear unusual voicesâhere they come. Re-enter Manuel, showing in Count Freberg and his lady, with a mask in her hand. Freb. (running to embrace De Mon.) My dearest Monfort! most unlook'd for pleasure! Do I indeed embrace thee here again? I saw thy servant standing by the gate, His face recall'd, and learnt the joyful tidings! Welcome, thrice welcome here! De Mon. I thank thee, Freberg, for this friendly visit, And this fair lady too. [Bowing to the lady. Lady. I fear, my lord, We do intrude at an untimely hour: But now, returning from a midnight mask, My husband did insist that we should enter. Freb. No, say not so; no hour untimely call, Which doth together bring long absent friends. Dear Monfort, why hast thou so slily play'd, Coming upon us thus so suddenly? De Mon. O! many varied thoughts do cross our brain, Which touch the will, but leave the memory trackless; And yet a strange compounded motive make, Wherefore a man should bend his evening walk To th' east or west, the forest or the field. Is it not often so? Freb. I ask no more, happy to see you here From any motive. There is one behind, Whose presence would have been a double bliss: Ah! how is she? The noble Jane De Monfort. De Mon. (confused). She isâI haveâI left my sister well. Lady. (to Freberg). My Freberg, you are heedless of respect. You surely mean to say the Lady Jane. Freb. Respect! No, madam; Princess, Empress, Queen, Could not denote a creature so exalted As this plain appellation doth, The noble Jane De Monfort. Lady. (turning from him displeased to Mon.) You are fatigued, my lord; you want repose; Say, should we not retire? Freb. Ha! is it so? My friend, your face is pale; have you been ill? De Mon. No, Freberg, no; I think I have been well. Freb. (shaking his head). I fear thou hast not, MonfortâLet it pass. We'll re-establish thee: we'll banish pain. I will collect some rare, some cheerful friends, And we shall spend together glorious hours, That gods might envy. Little time so spent Doth far outvalue all our life beside. This is indeed our life, our waking life, The rest dull breathing sleep. De Mon. Thus, it is true, from the sad years of life We sometimes do short hours, yea minutes strike, Keen, blissful, bright, never to be forgotten; Which, through the dreary gloom of time o'erpast, Shine like fair sunny spots on a wild waste. But few they are, as few the heaven-fir'd souls Whose magic power creates them. Bless'd art thou, If, in the ample circle of thy friends, Thou canst but boast a few. Freb. Judge for thyself: in truth I do not boast. There is amongst my friends, my later friends, A most accomplish'd stranger: new to Amberg; But just arriv'd, and will ere long depart: I met him in Franconia two years since. He is so full of pleasant anecdote, So rich, so gay, so poignant is his wit, Time vanishes before him as he speaks, And ruddy morning through the lattice peeps Ere night seems well begun. De Mon. How is he call'd? Freb. I will surprise thee with a welcome face: I will not tell thee now. Lady. (to Mon.) I have, my lord, a small request to make, And must not be denied. I too may boast Of some good friends, and beauteous country-women: To-morrow night I open wide my doors To all the fair and gay: beneath my roof Music, and dance, and revelry shall reign: I pray you come and grace it with your presence. De Mon. You honour me too much to be denied. Lady. I thank you, sir; and in return for this, We shall withdraw, and leave you to repose. Freb. Must it be so? Good nightâsweet sleep to thee! (to DeMonfort.) De Mon. (to Freb.) Good night. (To lady.) Good night, fair lady. Lady. Farewell! [Exeunt Freberg and lady. De Mon. (to Jer.) I thought Count Freberg had been now in France. Jer. He meant to go, as I have been inform'd. De Mon. Well, well, prepare my bed; I will to rest. [Exit Jerome. De Mon. (aside). I know not how it is, my heart stands back, And meets not this man's love.âFriends! rarest friends! Rather than share his undiscerning praise With every table-wit, and book-form'd sage, And paltry poet puling to the moon, I'd court from him proscription, yea abuse, And think it proud distinction. [Exit. SCENE II. A small apartment in Jerome's house: a table and breakfast set out. Enter De Monfort, followed by Manuel, and sits down by the table, with a cheerful face. De Mon. Manuel, this morning's sun shines pleasantly: These old apartments too are light and cheerful. Our landlord's kindness has reviv'd me much: He serves as though he lov'd me. This pure air Braces the listless nerves, and warms the blood: I feel in freedom here. [Filling a cup of coffee, and drinking. Man. Ah! sure, my lord, No air is purer than the air at home. De Mon. Here can I wander with assured steps, Nor dread, at every winding of the path, Lest an abhorred serpent cross my way, To moveâ (stopping short.) Man. What says your honour? There are no serpents in our pleasant fields. De Mon. Thinkst thou there are no serpents in the world, But those who slide along the grassy sod, And sting the luckless foot that presses them? There are who in the path of social life Do bask their spotted skins in Fortune's sun, And sting the soulâAy, till its healthful frame Is chang'd to secret, fest'ring, sore disease, So deadly is the wound. Man. Heav'n guard your honour from such horrid scath! They are but rare, I hope! De Mon. (shaking his head). We mark the hollow eye, the wasted frame, The gait disturb'd of wealthy honour'd men, But do not know the cause. Man. 'Tis very true. God keep you well, my lord! De Mon. I thank thee, Manuel, I am very well. I shall be gay too, by the setting sun. I go to revel it with sprightly dames, And drive the night away. [Filling another cup, and drinking. Man. I should be glad to see your honour gay. De Mon. And thou too shalt be gay. There, honest Manuel, Put these broad pieces in thy leathern purse, And take at night a cheerful jovial glass. Here is one too, for Bremer; he loves wine: And one for Jaques: be joyful altogether. Enter Servant. Ser. My lord, I met e'en now, a short way off, Your countryman the Marquis Rezenvelt. De Mon. (starting from his seat, and letting the cup fall from his hand). Whom sayst thou? Ser. Marquis Rezenvelt, an' please you. De Mon. Thou liestâit is not soâit is impossible! Ser. I saw him with these eyes, plain as yourself. De Mon. Fool! 'tis some passing stranger thou hast seen, And with a hideous likeness been deceiv'd. Ser. No other stranger could deceive my sight. De Mon. (dashing his clenched hand violently upon the table, and overturning every thing). Heaven blast thy sight! it lights on nothing good. Ser. I surely thought no harm to look upon him. De Mon. What, dost thou still insist? He must it be? Does it so please thee well? (Servant endeavours to speak.) Hold thy damn'd tongue! By heaven I'll kill thee! (Going furiously up to him.) Man. (in a soothing voice). Nay, harm him not, my lord; he speaks the truth; I've met his groom, who told me certainly His lord is here. I should have told you so, But thought, perhaps, it might displease your honour. De Mon. (becoming all at once calm, and turning sternly to Manuel. And how dar'st thou To think it would displease me? What is't to me who leaves or enters Amberg? But it displeases me, yea e'en to frenzy, That every idle fool must hither come, To break my leisure with the paltry tidings Of all the cursed things he stares upon. [Servant attempts to speakâDe Monfort stamps with his foot. Take thine ill-favour'd visage from my sight, And speak of it no more. [Exit Servant. And go thou too; I choose to be alone. [Exit Manuel. [De Monfort goes to the door by which they went out; opens it, and looks. But is he gone indeed? Yes, he is gone. [Goes to the opposite door, opens it, and looks: then gives loose to all the fury of gesture, and walks up and down in great agitation. It is too much: by heaven it is too much! He haunts meâstings meâlike a devil hauntsâ He'll make a raving maniac of meâVillain! The air wherein thou drawst thy fulsome breath Is poison to meâOceans shall divide us! (Pauses.) But no; thou thinkst I fear thee, cursed reptile; And hast a pleasure in the damned thought. Though my heart's blood should curdle at thy sight, I'll stay and face thee still. [Knocking at the chamber door. Ha! who knocks there? Freberg. (without). It is thy friend, De Monfort. De Mon. (opening the door). Enter, then. Enter Freberg. Freb. (taking his hand kindly). How art thou now? How hast thou pass'd the night? Has kindly sleep refresh'd thee? De Mon. Yes, I have lost an hour or two in sleep, And so should be refresh'd. Freb. And art thou not? Thy looks speak not of rest. Thou art disturb'd. De Mon. No, somewhat ruffled from a foolish cause, Which soon will pass away. Freb. (shaking his head). Ah no, De Monfort! something in thy face Tells me another tale. Then wrong me not: If any secret grief distract thy soul, Here am I all devoted to thy love: Open thy heart to me. What troubles thee? De Mon. I have no grief: distress me not, my friend. Freb. Nay, do not call me so. Wert thou my friend, Wouldst thou not open all thine inmost soul, And bid me share its every consciousness? De Mon. Freberg, thou knowst not man; not nature's man, But only him who, in smooth studied works Of polish'd sages, shines deceitfully In all the splendid foppery of virtue. That man was never born whose secret soul, With all its motley treasure of dark thoughts, Foul fantasies, vain musings, and wild dreams, Was ever open'd to another's scan. Away, away! it is delusion all. Freb. Well, be reserved then; perhaps I'm wrong. De Mon. How goes the hour? Freb. 'Tis early still; a long day lies before us; Let us enjoy it. Come along with me; I'll introduce you to my pleasant friend. De Mon. Your pleasant friend? Freb. Yes, him of whom I spake. [Taking his hand. There is no good I would not share with thee; And this man's company, to minds like thine, Is the best banquet feast I could bestow. But I will speak in mystery no more; It is thy townsman, noble Rezenvelt. [De Mon. pulls his hand hastily from Freberg, and shrinks back. Ha! what is this? Art thou pain-stricken, Monfort? Nay, on my life, thou rather seemst offended: Does it displease thee that I call him friend? De Mon. No, all men are thy friends. Freb. No, say not all men. But thou art offended. I see it well. I thought to do thee pleasure. But if his presence be not welcome here, He shall not join our company to-day. De Mon. What dost thou mean to say? What is't to me Whether I meet with such a thing as Rezenvelt To-day, to-morrow, every day, or never? Freb. In truth, I thought you had been well with him; He prais'd you much. De Mon. I thank him for his praiseâCome, let us move: This chamber is confin'd and airless grown. [Starting. I hear a stranger's voice! Freb. 'Tis Rezenvelt. Let him be told that we are gone abroad. De Mon. (proudly). No! let him enter. Who waits there? Ho! Manuel! Enter Manuel. What stranger speaks below? Man. The Marquis Rezenvelt. I have not told him that you are within. De Mon. (angrily). And wherefore didst thou not? Let him ascend. [A long pause. De Montfort walking up and down with a quickpace. Enter Rezenvelt, who runs freely up to De Monfort. Rez. (to De Mon.) My noble marquis, welcome! De Mon. Sir, I thank you. Rez. (to Freb.) My gentle friend, well met. Abroad so early? Freb. It is indeed an early hour for me. How sits thy last night's revel on thy spirits? Rez. O, light as ever. On my way to you, E'en now, I learnt De Montfort was arriv'd, And turn'd my steps aside; so here I am. [Bowing gaily to De Monfort. De Mon. I thank you, sir; you do me too much honour. [Proudly. Rez. Nay, say not so; not too much honour surely, Unless, indeed, 'tis more than pleases you. De Mon. (confused). Having no previous notice of your coming, I look'd not for it. Rez. Ay, true indeed; when I approach you next, I'll send a herald to proclaim my coming, And bow to you by sound of trumpet, marquis. De Mon. (to Freb., turning haughtily from Rezenvelt with affected indifference). How does your cheerful friend, that good old man? Freb. My cheerful friend? I know not whom you mean. De Mon. Count Waterlan. Freb. I know not one so nam'd. De Mon. (very confused). O pardon meâit was at Basle I knew him. Freb. You have not yet inquir'd for honest Reisdale. I met him as I came, and mention'd you. He seem'd amaz'd; and fain he would have learnt What cause procur'd us so much happiness. He question'd hard, and hardly would believe; I could not satisfy his strong desire. Rez. And know you not what brings De Montfort here? Freb. Truly I do not. Rez. O! 'tis love of me. I have but two short days in Amberg been, And here with postman's speed he follows me, Finding his home so dull and tiresome grown. Freb. (to De Mon.) Is Rezenvelt so sadly miss'd with you? Your town so chang'd? De Mon. Not altogether so; Some witlings and jest-mongers still remain For fools to laugh at. Rez. But he laughs not, and therefore he is wise. He ever frowns on them with sullen brow Contemptuous; therefore he is very wise; Nay, daily frets his most refined soul With their poor folly to its inmost core; Therefore he is most eminently wise. Freb. Fy, Rezenvelt! you are too early gay. Such spirits rise but with the ev'ning glass: They suit not placid morn. [To De Monfort, who, after walking impatiently up and down, comes close to his ear and lays hold of his arm. What would, you Monfort? De Mon. Nothingâwhat is't o'clock? No, noâI had forgotâ'tis early still. [Turns away again. Freb. (to Rez.) Waltser informs me that you have agreed To read his verses o'er, and tell the truth. It is a dangerous task. Rez. Yet I'll be honest: I can but lose his favour and a feast. [Whilst they speak, De Monfort walks up and down impatiently and irresolute: at last pulls the bell violently. Enter Servant. De Mon. (to ser.) What dost thou want? Ser. I thought your honour rung. De Mon. I have forgotâstay. Are my horses saddled? Ser. I thought, my lord, you would not ride to-day, After so long a journey. De Mon. (impatiently). Wellâ'tis good. Begone!âI want thee not. [Exit servant. Rez. (smiling significantly). I humbly crave your pardon, gentle marquics. It grieves me that I cannot stay with you, And make my visit of a friendly length. I trust your goodness will excuse me now; Another time I shall be less unkind. (To Freberg.) Will you not go with me? Freb. Excuse me, Monfort, I'll return again. [Exeunt Rezenvelt and Freberg. De Mon. (alone, tossing his arms distractedly). Hell hath no greater torment for th' accurs'd Than this man's presence givesâ Abhorred fiend! he hath a pleasure too, A damned pleasure in the pain he gives! Oh! the side glance of that detested eye! That conscious smile! that full insulting lip! It touches every nerve: it makes me mad. What, does it please thee? Dost thou woo my hate? Hate shalt thou have! determin'd, deadly hate, Which shall awake no smile. Malignant villain! The venom of thy mind is rank and devilish, And thin the film that hides it. Thy hateful visage ever spoke thy worth: I loath'd thee when a boy. That men should be besotted with him thus! And Freberg likewise so bewitched is, That like a hireling flatt'rer at his heels He meanly paces, off'ring brutish praise. O! I could curse him too! [Exit. ACT II. SCENE I. A very splendid apartment in Count Freberg's house, fancifully decorated. A wide folding-door opened, shows another magnificent room lighted up to receive company. Enter through the folding doors the Count and Countess, richly dressed. Freb. (looking round). In truth, I like those decorations well: They suit those lofty walls. And here, my love, The gay profusion of a woman's fancy Is well display'd. Noble simplicity Becomes us less, on such a night as this, Than gaudy show. Lady. Is it not noble then? (He shakes his head.) I thought it so; And as I know you love simplicity, I did intend it should be simple too. Freb. Be satisfied, I pray; we want to-night A cheerful banquet-house, and not a temple. How runs the hour? Lady. It is not late, but soon we shall be rous'd With the loud entry of our frolic guests. Enter a Page, richly dressed. Page. Madam, there is a lady in your hall, Who begs to be admitted to your presence. Lady. Is it not one of our invited friends? Page. No, far unlike to them; it is a stranger. Lady. How looks her countenance? Page. So queenly, so commanding, and so noble, I shrunk at first in awe; but when she smil'd, For so she did to see me thus abash'd, Methought I could have compass'd sea and land To do her bidding. Lady. Is she young or old? Page. Neither, if right I guess; but she is fair: For Time hath laid his hand so gently on her, As he too had been aw'd. Lady. The foolish stripling! She has bewitch'd thee. Is she large in stature? Page. So stately and so graceful is her form, I thought at first her stature was gigantic; But on a near approach I found, in truth, She scarcely does surpass the middle size. Lady. What is her garb? Page. I cannot well describe the fashion of it. She is not deck'd in any gallant trim, But seems to me clad in the usual weeds Of high habitual state; for as she moves Wide flows her robe in many a waving fold, As I have seen unfurled banners play With a soft breeze. Lady. Thine eyes deceive thee, boy; It is an apparition thou hast seen. Freb. (starting from his seat, where he has been sitting during the conversation between the lady and the page). It is an apparition he has seen, Or it is Jane De Monfort. [Exit, hastily. Lady (displeased). No; such description surely suits not her. Did she inquire for me? Page. She ask'd to see the lady of Count Freberg. Lady. Perhaps it is not sheâI fear it isâ Ha! here they come. He has but guess'd too well. Enter Freberg, leading in Jane De Monfort. Freb. (presenting her to lady). Here, madam, welcome a most worthy guest. Lady. Madam, a thousand welcomes! Pardon me; I could not guess who honour'd me so far; I should not else have waited coldly here. Jane. I thank you for this welcome, gentle countess. But take those kind excuses back again; I am a bold intruder on this hour, And am entitled to no ceremony. I came in quest of a dear truant friend, But Freberg has inform'd meâ (To Freberg.) And he is well, you say? Freb. Yes, well, but joyless. Jane. It is the usual temper of his mind; It opens not, but with the thrilling touch Of some strong heart-string o' the sudden press'd. Freb. It may be so, I've known him otherwise: He is suspicious grown. Jane. Not so, Count Freberg; Monfort is too noble. Say rather, that he is a man in grief, Wearing at times a strange and scowling eye; And thou, less generous than beseems a friend, Hast thought too hardly of him. Freb. (bowing with great respect). So will I say; I'll own nor word nor will, that can offend you. Lady. De Monfort is engag'd to grace our feast: Ere long you'll see him here. Jane. I thank you truly, but this homely dress Suits not the splendour of such scenes as these. Freb. (pointing to her dress). Such artless and majestic elegance, So exquisitely just, so nobly simple, Will make the gorgeous blush. Jane (smiling). Nay, nay, be more consistent, courteous knight, And do not praise a plain and simple guise With such profusion of unsimple words. I cannot join your company to-night. Lady. Not stay to see your brother? Jane. Therefore it is I would not, gentle hostess. Here will he find all that can woo the heart To joy and sweet forgetfulness of pain; The sight of me would wake his feeling mind To other thoughts. I am no doating mistress; No fond distracted wife, who must forthwith Rush to his arms and weep. I am his sister: The eldest daughter of his father's house: Calm and unwearied is my love for him; And having found him, patiently I'll wait, Nor greet him in the hour of social joy, To dash his mirth with tears.â The night wears on; permit me to withdraw. Freb. Nay, do not, do not injure us so far! Disguise thyself, and join our friendly train. Jane. You wear not masks to-night. Lady. We wear not masks, but you may be con-ceal'd Behind the double foldings of a veil. Jane (after pausing to consider). In truth, I feel a little so inclin'd. Methinks unknown, I e'en might speak to him, And gently prove the temper of his mind; But for the means I must become your debtor. [To lady. Lady. Who waits? (Enter her woman). Attend this lady to my wardrobe, And do what she commands you. [Exeunt Jane and waiting-woman. Freb. (looking after Jane, as she goes out, with admiration). Oh! what a soul she bears! See how she steps! Nought but the native dignity of worth E'er taught the moving form such noble grace. Lady. Such lofty mien, and high assumed gait, I've seen ere now, and men have call'd it pride. Freb. No, 'faith! thou never didst, but oft indeed The paltry imitation thou hast seen. (Looking at her.) How hang those trappings on thy motley gown? They seem like garlands on a May-day queen, Which hinds have dress'd in sport. [Lady turns away displeased. Freb. Nay, do not frown; I spoke it but in haste; For thou art lovely still in every garb. But see, the guests assemble. Enter groups of well-dressed people, who pay their compliments to Freberg and his lady; and, followed by her, pass into the inner apartment, where more company appear assembling, as if by another entry. Freb. (who remains on the front of the stage with a friend or two). How loud the hum of this gay-meeting crowd! 'Tis like a bee-swarm in the noonday sun. Music will quell the sound. Who waits without? Music strike up. [Music, and when it ceases, enter from the inner apartment Rezenvelt, with several gentlemen, all richly dressed. Freb. (to those just entered). What, lively gallants, quit the field so soon? Are there no beauties in that moving crowd To fix your fancy? Rez. Ay, marry are there! men of ev'ry fancy May in that moving crowd some fair one find To suit their taste, though whimsical and strange, As ever fancy own'd. Beauty of every cast and shade is there, From the perfection of a faultless form, Down to the common, brown, unnoted maid, Who looks but pretty in her Sunday gown. 1st gent. There is, indeed, a gay variety. Rez. And if the liberality of nature Suffices not, there's store of grafted charms, Blending in one the sweets of many plants, So obstinately, strangely opposite, As would have well defied all other art But female cultivation. Aged youth, With borrowed locks, in rosy chaplets bound, Clothes her dim eye, parch'd lips, and skinny cheek In most unlovely softness: And youthful age, with fat round trackless face, The downcast look of contemplation deep Most pensively assumes. Is it not even so? The native prude, With forced laugh, and merriment uncouth, Plays off the wild coquette's successful charms With most unskilful pains; and the coquette, In temporary crust of cold reserve, Fixes her studied looks upon the ground, Forbiddingly demure. Freb. Fy! thou art too severe. Rez. Say, rather, gentle. I 'faith! the very dwarfs attempt to charm With lofty airs of puny majesty; While potent damsels, of a portly make, Totter like nurslings, and demand the aid Of gentle sympathy. From all those diverse modes of dire assault, He owns a heart of hardest adamant, Who shall escape to-night. Freb. (to De Mon., who has entered during Rezenvelt' s speech, and heard the greatest part of it). Ha, ha, ha, ha! How pleasantly he gives his wit the rein, Yet guides its wild career! [De Mon. is silent. Rez. (smiling archly). What, think you, Freberg, the same powerful spell Of transformation reigns o'er all to-night? Or that De Monfort is a woman turn'd,â So widely from his native self to swerve, As grace my folly with a smile of his? De Mon. Nay, think not, Rezenvelt, there is no smile I can bestow on thee. There is a smile, A smile of nature too, which I can spare, And yet, perhaps, thou wilt not thank me for it. [Smiles contemptuously. Rez. Not thank thee! It were surely most ungrateful No thanks to pay for nobly giving me What, well we see, has cost thee so much pain. For nature hath her smiles of birth more painful Than bitt'rest execrations. Freb. These idle words will lead us to disquiet: Forbear, forbear, my friends! Go, Rezenvelt, Accept the challenge of those lovely dames, Who through the portal come with bolder steps To claim your notice. Enter a group of ladies from the other apartment, who walk slowly across the bottom of the stage, and return to it again. Rez. shrugs up his shoulders, as if unwilling to go. 1st gent. (to Rez.) Behold in sable veil a lady comes, Whose noble air doth challenge fancy's skill To suit it with a countenance as goodly. [Pointing to Jane De Mon., who now enters in a thick black veil. Rez. Yes, this way lies attraction. (To Freb.) With permissionâ [Going up to Jane. Fair lady, though within that envious shroud Your beauty deigns not to enlighten us, We bid you welcome, and our beauties here Will welcome you the more for such concealment. With the permission of our noble hostâ [Taking her hand, and leading her to the front of the stage. Jane. (to Freb.) Pardon me this presumption, courteous sir: I thus appear (pointing to her veil), not careless of respect Unto the generous lady of the feast. Beneath this veil no beauty shrouded is, That, now, or pain, or pleasure can bestow. Within the friendly cover of its shade I only wish, unknown, again to see One who, alas! is heedless of my pain. De Mon. Yes, it is ever thus. Undo that veil, And give thy count'nance to the cheerful light. Men now all soft and female beauty scorn, And mock the gentle cares which aim to please. It is most damnable! undo thy veil, And think of him no more. Jane. I know it well: e'en to a proverb grown, Is lovers' faith, and I had borne such slight: But he, who has, alas! forsaken me, Was the companion of my early days, My cradle's mate, mine infant play-fellow. Within our op'ning minds, with riper years, The love of praise and gen'rous virtue sprung: Through varied life our pride, our joys were one; At the same tale we wept: he is my brother. De Mon. And he forsook thee?âNo, I dare not curse him: My heart upbraids me with a crime like his. Jane. Ah! do not thus distress a feeling heart. All sisters are not to the soul entwin'd With equal bands; thine has not watch'd for thee, Wept for thee, cheer'd thee, shar'd thy weal and woe, As I have done for him. De Mon. (eagerly). Ah! has she not? By heav'n the sum of all thy kindly deeds Were but as chaff pois'd against massy gold, Compar'd to that which I do owe her love. Oh, pardon me! I mean not to offendâ I am too warmâbut she of whom I speak Is the dear sister of my earliest love; In noble, virtuous worth to none a second: And though behind those sable folds were hid As fair a face as ever woman own'd, Still would I say she is as fair as thou. How oft amidst the beauty-blazing throng, I've proudly to th' inquiring stranger told Her name and lineage! yet within her house, The virgin mother of an orphan race Her dying parents left, this noble woman Did, like a Roman matron, proudly sit, Despising all the blandishments of love; While many a youth his hopeless love conceal'd, Or, humbly distant, woo'd her like a queen. Forgive, I pray you! O forgive this boasting! In faith! I mean you no discourtesy. Jane (off her guard, in a soft natural tone of voice). Oh, no! nor do me any. De Mon. What voice speaks now? Withdraw, withdraw this shade! For if thy face bear semblance to thy voice, I'll fall and worship thee. Pray! pray undo! [Puts forth his hand eagerly to snatch away the veil, whilst she shrinks back, and Rezenvelt steps between to prevent him. Rez. Stand off: no hand shall lift this sacred veil. De Mon. What, dost thou think De Monfort fall'n so low, That there may live a man beneath heav'n's roof, Who dares to say, he shall not? Rez. He lives who dares to sayâ Jane (throwing back her veil, much alarmed, and rushing between them). Forbear, forbear! [Rezenvelt, very much struck, steps back respectfully, and makes her a low bow. De Monfort stands for a while motionless, gazing upon her, till she, looking expressively to him, extends her arms, and he, rushing into them, bursts into tears. Freberg seems very much pleased. The company then advancing from the inner apartment, gather about them, and the scene closes. SCENE II. De Monfort 's apartments. Enter De Monfort, with a disordered air, and his hand pressed upon his forehead, followed by Jane. De Mon. No more, my sister, urge me not again: My secret troubles cannot be reveal'd. From all participation of its thoughts My heart recoils: I pray thee be contented. Jane. What, must I, like a distant humble friend, Observe thy restless eye, and gait disturb'd, In timid silence, whilst with yearning heart I turn aside to weep? O no! De Monfort! A nobler task thy nobler mind will give; Thy true entrusted friend I still shall be. De Mon. Ah, Jane, forbear! I cannot e'en to thee. Jane. Then, fy upon it! fy upon it, Monfort! There was a time when e'en with murder stain'd, Had it been possible that such dire deed Could e'er have been the crime of one so piteous, Thou wouldst have told it me. De Mon. So would I nowâbut ask of this no more. All other trouble but the one I feel I had disclos'd to thee. I pray thee spare me. It is the secret weakness of my nature. Jane. Then secret let it be; I urge no farther. The eldest of our valiant father's hopes, So sadly orphan'd, side by side we stood, Like two young trees, whose boughs in early strength Screen the weak saplings of the rising grove, And brave the storm togetherâ I have so long, as if by nature's right, Thy bosom's inmate and adviser been, I thought through life I should have so remain'd, Nor ever known a change. Forgive me, Monfort, A humbler station will I take by thee: The close attendant of thy wand'ring steps; The cheerer of this home, with strangers sought; The soother of those griefs I must not know: This is mine office now: I ask no more. De Mon. Oh, Jane! thou dost constrain me with thy love! Would I could tell it thee! Jane. Thou shalt not tell me. Nay I'll stop mine ears, Nor from the yearnings of affection wring What shrinks from utt'rance. Let it pass, my brother. I'll stay by thee; I'll cheer thee, comfort thee: Pursue with thee the study of some art, Or nobler science, that compels the mind To steady thought progressive, driving forth All floating, wild, unhappy fantasies; Till thou, with brow unclouded, smil'st again; Like one who, from dark visions of the night, When th' active soul within its lifeless cell Holds it own world, with dreadful fancy press'd Of some dire, terrible, or murd'rous deed, Wakes to the dawning morn, and blesses heaven. De Mon. It will not pass away; 'twill haunt me still. Jane. Ah! say not so, for I will haunt thee too; And be to it so close an adversary, That, though I wrestle darkling with the fiend, I shall o'ercome it. De Mon. Thou most gen'rous woman! Why do I treat thee thus? It should not beâ And yet I cannotâO that cursed villain! He will not let me be the man I would. Jane. What sayst thou, brother? Oh! what words are these? They have awak'd my soul to dreadful thoughts. I do beseech thee, speak! [He shakes his head, and turns from her; she following him. By the affection thou didst ever bear me; By the dear mem'ry of our infant days; By kindred living ties, ay, and by those Who sleep i' the tomb, and cannot call to thee, I do conjure thee, speak! [He waves her off with his hand and covers his face with the other, still turning from her. Ah! wilt thou not? (Assuming dignity.) Then, if affection, most unwearied love, Tried early, long, and never wanting found, O'er gen'rous man hath more authority, More rightful power than crown or sceptre give, I do command thee. [He throws himself into a chair, greatly agitated. De Monfort, do not thus resist my love. Here I entreat thee on my bended knees. [Kneeling. Alas! my brother! [De Monfort starts up, and catching her in his arms, raises her up, then placing her in the chair, kneels at her feet. De Mon. Thus let him kneel who should the abased be, And at thine honour'd feet confession make! I'll tell thee allâbut, oh! thou wilt despise me. For in my breast a raging passion burns, To which thy soul no sympathy will ownâ A passion which hath made my nightly couch A place of torment; and the light of day, With the gay intercourse of social man, Feel like th' oppressive airless pestilence. O Jane! thou wilt despise me. Jane. Say not so: I never can despise thee, gentle brother. A lover's jealousy and hopeless pangs No kindly heart contemns. De Mon A lover, sayst thou? No, it is hate! black, lasting, deadly hate! Which thus hath driven me forth from kindred peace, From social pleasure, from my native home, To be a sullen wand'rer on the earth, Avoiding all men, cursing and accurs'd. Jane. De Monfort, this is fiend-like, frightful, terrible! What being, by th' Almighty Father form'd, Of flesh and blood, created even as thou, Could in thy breast such horrid tempest wake, Who art thyself his fellow? Unknit thy brows, and spread those wrath-clench'd hands. Some sprite accurs'd within thy bosom mates To work thy ruin. Strive with it, my brother! Strive bravely with it; drive it from thy breast; 'Tis the degrader of a noble heart: Curse it, and bid it part. De Mon. It will not part. (His hand on his breast.) I've lodg'd it here too long: With my first cares I felt its rankling touch; I loath'd him when a boy. Jane. Whom didst thou say? De Mon. Oh! that detested Rezenvelt! E'en in our early sports, like two young whelps Of hostile breed, instinctively reverse, Each 'gainst the other pitch'd his ready pledge, And frown'd defiance. As we onward pass'd From youth to man's estate, his narrow art And envious gibing malice, poorly veil'd In the affected carelessness of mirth, Still more detestable and odious grew. There is no living being on this earth Who can conceive the malice of his soul, With all his gay and damned merriment, To those, by fortune or by merit plac'd Above his paltry self. When, low in fortune, He look'd upon the state of prosp'rous men, As nightly birds, rous'd from their murky holes, Do scowl and chatter at the light of day, I could endure it; even as we bear Th' impotent bite of some half-trodden worm, I could endure it. But when honours came, And wealth and new-got titles fed his pride; Whilst flatt'ring knaves did trumpet forth his praise, And grov'ling idiots grinn'd applauses on him; Oh! then I could no longer suffer it! It drove me frantic.âWhat! what would I give! What would I give to crush the bloated toad, So rankly do I loathe him! Jane. And would thy hatred crush the very man Who gave to thee that life he might have ta'en; That life which thou so rashly didst expose To aim at his? Oh! this is horrible! De Mon. Ha! thou hast heard it, then? From all the world, But most of all from thee, I thought it hid. Jane. I heard a secret whisper, and resolv'd Upon the instant to return to thee. Didst thou receive my letter? De Mon. I did! I did! 'twas that which drove me hither. I could not bear to meet thine eye again. Jane. Alas! that, tempted by a sister's tears, I ever left thy house! These few past months, These absent months, have brought us all this woe. Had I remain'd with thee it had not been. And yet, methinks, it should not move you thus. You dar'd him to the field; both bravely fought; He more adroit disarm'd you; courteously Return'd the forfeit sword, which, so return'd, You did refuse to use against him more; And then, as says report, you parted friends. De Mon. When he disarm'd this curs'd, this worthless hand Of its most worthless weapon, he but spar'd From dev'lish pride, which now derives a bliss In seeing me thus fetter'd, sham'd, subjected With the vile favour of his poor forbearance; While he securely sits with gibing brow, And basely bates me like a muzzled cur Who cannot turn again.â Until that day, till that accursed day, I knew not half the torment of this hell, Which burns within my breast. Heaven's lightnings blast him! Jane. O this is horrible! Forbear, forbear! Lest heaven's vengeance light upon thy head, For this most impious wish. De Mon. Then let it light. Torments more fell than I have felt already It cannot send. To be annihilated, What all men shrink from; to be dust, be nothing, Were bliss to me, compar'd to what I am! Jane. Oh! wouldst thou kill me with these dreadful words? De Mon. (raising his hands to heaven). Let me but once upon his ruin look, Then close mine eyes for ever! [Jane, in great distress, staggers back, and supports herself upon the side scene. De Mon., alarmed, runs up to her with a softened voice. Ha! how is this? thou'rt ill; thou'rt very pale. What have I done to thee? Alas, alas! I meant not to distress thee.âO my sister! Jane (shaking her head). I cannot speak to thee. De Mon. I have kill'd thee. Turn, turn thee not away! look on me still! Oh! droop not thus, my life, my pride, my sister; Look on me yet again. Jane. Thou too, De Monfort, In better days, wert wont to be my pride. De Mon. I am a wretch, most wretched in myself, And still more wretched in the pain I give. O curse that villain! that detested villain! He has spread mis'ry o'er my fated life: He will undo us all. Jane. I've held my warfare through a troubled world, And borne with steady mind my share of ill; For thou wert then the helpmate of my toil. But now the wane of life comes darkly on, And hideous passion tears me from thy heart, Blasting thy worth.âI cannot strive with this. De Mon. (affectionately). What shall I do? Jane. Call up thy noble spirit; Rouse all the gen'rous energy of virtue; And with the strength of heaven-endued man, Repel the hideous foe. Be great; be valiant. O, if thou couldst! e'en shrouded as thou art In all the sad infirmities of nature, What a most noble creature wouldst thou be! De Mon. Ay, if I could: alas! alas! I cannot. Jane. Thou canst, thou mayst, thou wilt. We shall not part till I have turn'd thy soul. Enter Manuel. De Mon. Ha! some one enters. Wherefore com'st thou here? Man. Count Freberg waits your leisure. De Mon. (angrily). Begone, begone!âI cannot see him now. [Exit Manuel. Jane. Come to my closet; free from all intrusion, I'll school thee there; and thou again shalt be My willing pupil, and my gen'rous friend, The noble Monfort I have lov'd so long, And must not, will not lose. De Mon. Do as thou wilt; I will not grieve thee more. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. This scene has been very much altered from what it was in the former editions of this play, and scene fifth of the last act will be found to be almost entirely changed. These alterations, though of no great importance, are, I hope, upon the whole, improvements. Countess Freberg' s dressing-room. Enter the Countess dispirited and out of humour, and throws herself into a chair: enter, by the opposite side, Theresa. Ther. Madam, I am afraid you are unwell: What is the matter? does your head ache? Lady (peevishly). No, 'Tis not my head: concern thyself no more With what concerns not thee. Ther. Go you abroad to-night? Lady. Yes, thinkest thou I'll stay and fret at home? Ther. Then please to say what you would choose to wear:â One of your newest robes? Lady. I hate them all. Ther. Surely that purple scarf became you well, With all those wreaths of richly-hanging flowers. Did I not overhear them say, last night, As from the crowded ball-room ladies pass'd, How gay and handsome, in her costly dress, The Countess Freberg look'd? Lady. Didst thou o'erhear it? Ther. I did, and more than this. Lady. Well, all are not so greatly prejudic'd; All do not think me like a May-day queen, Which peasants deck in sport. Ther. And who said this? Lady (putting her handkerchief to her eyes). E'en my good lord, Theresa. Ther. He said it but in jest. He loves you well. Lady. I know as well as thou he loves me well. But what of that! he takes in me no pride: Elsewhere his praise and admiration go, And Jane De Monfort is not mortal woman. Ther. The wondrous character this lady bears For worth and excellence: from early youth The friend and mother of her younger sisters, Now greatly married, as I have been told, From her most prudent care, may well excuse The admiration of so good a man As my good master is. And then, dear madam, I must confess, when I myself did hear How she was come through the rough winter's storm, To seek and comfort an unhappy brother, My heart beat kindly to her. Lady. Ay, ay, there is a charm in this I find: But wherefore may she not have come as well Through wintry storms to seek a lover too? Ther. No, madam, no, I could not think of this. Lady. That would reduce her in your eyes, mayhap, To woman's level.âNow I see my vengeance! I'll tell it round that she is hither come, Under pretence of finding out De Monfort, To meet with Rezenvelt. When Freberg hears it, 'Twill help, I ween, to break this magic charm. Ther. And say what is not, madam? Lady. How canst thou know that I shall say what is not? 'Tis like enough I shall but speak the truth. Ther. Ah, no! there isâ Lady. Well, hold thy foolish tongue. [Freberg's voice is heard without. After hesitating. I will not see him now. [Exit. [Enter Freberg by the opposite side, passing on hastily. Ther. Pardon, my lord; I fear you are in haste. Yet must I crave that you will give to me The books my lady mention'd to you: she Has charg'd me to remind you. Freb. I'm in haste. [Passing on. Ther. Pray you, my lord: your countess wants them much: The Lady Jane De Monfort ask'd them of her. Freb. (returning instantly). Are they for her? I knew not this before. I will, then, search them out immediately. There is nought good or precious in my keeping, That is not dearly honour'd by her use. Ther. My lord, what would your gentle countess say, If she o'erheard her own request neglected, Until supported by a name more potent? Freb. Thinkst thou she is a fool, my good Theresa, Vainly to please herself with childish thoughts Of matching what is matchlessâJane De Monfort? Thinkst thou she is a fool, and cannot see, That love and admiration often thrive Though far apart? [Re-enter lady with great violence. Lady. I am a fool, not to have seen full well, That thy best pleasure in o'er-rating so This lofty stranger, is to humble me, And cast a dark'ning shadow o'er my head. Ay, wherefore dost thou stare upon me thus? Art thou asham'd that I have thus surpris'd thee? Well mayst thou be so! Freb. True; thou rightly sayst. Well may I be asham'd: not for the praise Which I have ever openly bestow'd On Monfort's noble sister; but that thus, Like a poor mean and jealous listener, She should be found, who is Count Freberg's wife. Lady. Oh, I am lost and ruin'd! hated, scorn'd! [Pretending to faint. Freb. Alas, I have been too rough! [Taking her hand and kissing it tenderly. My gentle love! my own, my only love! See, she revives again. How art thou, love? Support her to her chamber, good Theresa. I'll sit and watch by her. I've been too rough. [Exeunt; lady supported by Freb. and Ther. SCENE II. De Monfort discovered sitting by a table reading. After a little time he lays down his book, and continues in a thoughtful posture Enter to him Jane De Monfort. Jane. Thanks, gentle brother.â [Pointing to the book. Thy willing mind has rightly been employ'd: Did not thy heart warm at the fair display Of peace and concord and forgiving love? De Mon. I know resentment may to love be turn'd, Though keen and lasting, into love as strong: And fiercest rivals in th' ensanguin'd field Have cast their brandish'd weapons to the ground, Joining their mailed breasts in close embrace, With gen'rous impulse fir'd. I know right well The darkest, fellest wrongs have been forgiven Seventy times o'er from blessed heav'nly love: I've heard of things like these; I've heard and wept. But what is this to me? Jane. All, all, my brother! It bids thee too that noble precept learn, To love thine enemy. De Mon. Th' uplifted stroke that would a wretch destroy, Gorg'd with my richest spoil, stain'd with my blood, I would arrest, and cry, âHold! hold! have mercy.â But when the man most adverse to my nature, Who e'en from childhood hath, with rude malevolence, Withheld the fair respect all paid beside, Turning my very praise into derision, Who galls and presses me where'er I go, Would claim the gen'rous feelings of my heart, Nature herself doth lift her voice aloud, And cry, âIt is impossible!â Jane. (shaking her head). Ah, Monfort, Monfort! De Mon. I can forgive th' envenom'd reptile's sting, But hate his loathsome self. Jane. And canst thou do no more for love of heaven? De Mon. Alas! I cannot now so school my mind As holy men have taught, nor search it truly: But this, my Jane, I'll do for love of thee; And more it is than crowns could win me to, Or any power but thine. I'll see the man. Th' indignant risings of abhorrent nature; The stern contraction of my scowling brows, That like the plant whose closing leaves do shrink At hostile touch, still knit at his approach; The crooked curving lip, by instinct taught, In imitation of disgustful things, To pout and swell, I strictly will repress; And meet him with a tamed countenance, E'en as a townsman, who would live at peace, And pay him the respect his station claims. I'll crave his pardon too for all offence My dark and wayward temper may have done. Nay more, I will confess myself his debtor For the forbearance I have curs'd so oft: Life spar'd by him, more horrid than the grave With all its dark corruption! This I'll do. Will it suffice thee? More than this I cannot. Jane. No more than this do I require of thee In outward act, though in thy heart, my friend, I hop'd a better change, and yet will hope. I told thee Freberg had propos'd a meeting. De Mon. I know it well. Jane. And Rezenvelt consents. He meets you here; so far he shows respect. De Mon. Well, let it be; the sooner past the better. Jane. I'm glad to hear you say so, for, in truth, He has propos'd for it an early hour. 'Tis almost near his time; I came to tell you. De Mon. What, comes he here so soon? shame on his speed! It is not decent thus to rush upon me. He loves the secret pleasure he will feel To see me thus subdued. Jane. O say not so! he comes with heart sincere. De Mon. Could we not meet elsewhere? from homeâi' the fields, Where other menâmust I alone receive him? Where is your agent, Freberg, and his friends, That I must meet him here? [Walks up and down, very much disturbed. Now! didst thou say?âhow goes the hour?âe'en now! I would some other friend were first arriv'd. Jane. See, to thy wish come Freberg and his dame. De Mon. His lady too! why comes he not alone? Must all the world upon our meeting stare? Enter Count Freberg and his Countess. Freb. A happy morrow to my noble marquis, And his most noble sister! Jane. Gen'rous Freberg, Your face, methinks, forebodes a happy morn, Open and cheerful. What of Rezenvelt? Freb. I left him at his home, prepar'd to follow: He'll soon appear. (To De Monfort.) And now, my worthy friend, Give me your hand; this happy change delights me. [De Monfort gives him his hand coldly, and they walk to the bottom of the stage together, in earnest discourse, whilst Jane and the Countess remain in the front. Lady. My dearest madam, will you pardon me? I know Count Freberg's bus'ness with De Monfort, And had a strong desire to visit you, So much I wish the honour of your friendship; For he retains no secret from mine ear. Jane (archly). Knowing your prudenceâyou are welcome, madam; So shall Count Freberg's lady ever be. [De Monfort and Freberg returning towards the front of the stage, still engaged in discourse. Freb. He is indeed a man, within whose breast Firm rectitude and honour hold their seat, Though unadorned with that dignity Which were their fittest garb. Now, on my life! I know no truer heart than Rezenvelt. De Mon. Well, Freberg, well, there needs not all this pains To garnish out his worth: let it suffice; I am resolv'd I will respect the man, As his fair station and repute demand. Methinks I see not at your jolly feasts The youthful knight, who sang so pleasantly. Freb. A pleasant circumstance detains him hence; Pleasant to those who love high gen'rous deeds Above the middle pitch of common minds; And, though I have been sworn to secrecy, Yet must I tell it thee. This knight is near akin to Rezenvelt, To whom an old relation, short while dead, A good estate bequeathed, some leagues distant. But Rezenvelt, now rich in fortune's store, Disdain'd the sordid love of further gain, And gen'rously the rich bequest resign'd To this young man, blood of the same degree To the deceas'd, and low in fortune's gifts, Who is from hence to take possession of it: Was it not nobly done? De Mon. 'Twas right and honourable. This morning is oppressive, warm, and heavy: There hangs a foggy closeness in the air; Dost thou not feel it? Freb. O no! to think upon a gen'rous deed Expands my soul, and makes me lightly breathe. De Mon. Who gives the feast to-night? His name escapes me. You say I am invited. Freb. Old Count Waterlan. In honour of your townsman's gen'rous gift, He spreads the board. De Mon. He is too old to revel with the gay. Freb. But not too old is he to honour virtue. I shall partake of it with open soul; For, on my honest faith, of living men I know not one, for talents, honour, worth, That I should rank superior to Rezenvelt. De Mon. How virtuous he hath been in three short days! Freb. Nay, longer, marquis; but my friendship rests Upon the good report of other men, And that has told me much. [De Monfort aside, going some steps hastily from Freberg, and rending his cloak with agitation as he goes. Would he were come! by heav'n I would he were! This fool besets me so. [Suddenly correcting himself, and joining the ladies, who have retired to the bottom of the stage, he speaks to Countess Freberg with affected cheerfulness. The sprightly dames of Amberg rise by times, Untarnish'd with the vigils of the night. Lady. Praise us not rashly, 'tis not always so. De Mon. He does not rashly praise who praises you; For he were dull indeedâ [Stopping short, as if he heard something. Lady. How dull indeed? De Mon. I should have saidâIt has escap'd me nowâ [Listening again, as if he heard something. Jane (to De Mon.) What, hear you aught? De Mon. (hastily). 'Tis nothing. Lady (to De Mon.) Nay, do not let me lose it so, my lord. Some fair one has bewitch'd your memory, And robs me of the half-form'd compliment. Jane. Half-utter'd praise is to the curious mind As to the eye half-veiled beauty is, More precious than the whole. Pray pardon him. Some one approaches. [Listening. Freb. No, no, it is a servant who ascends; He will not come so soon. De Mon. (off his guard). 'Tis Rezenvelt: I heard his well-known foot, From the first staircase, mounting step by step. Freb. How quick an ear thou hast for distant sound! I heard him not. [De Monfort looks embarrassed, and is silent. Enter Rezenvelt. [De Monfort, recovering himself, goes up to receive Rezenvelt, who meets him with a cheerful countenance. De Mon. (to Rez) I am, my lord, beholden to you greatly. This ready visit makes me much your debtor. Rez. Then may such debts between us, noble marquis, Be oft incurr'd, and often paid again! (To Jane.) Madam, I am devoted to your service, And ev'ry wish of yours commands my will. (To Countess.) Lady, good morning. (To Freb.) Well, my gentle friend, You see I have not linger'd long behind. Freb. No, thou art sooner than I look'd for thee. Rez. A willing heart adds feather to the heel, And makes the clown a winged Mercury. De Mon. Then let me say, that, with a grateful mind, I do receive these tokens of good will; And must regret, that, in my wayward moods, I have too oft forgot the due regard Your rank and talents claim. Rez. No, no, De Monfort, You have but rightly curb'd a wanton spirit, Which makes me too neglectful of respect. Let us be friends, and think of this no more. Freb. Ay, let it rest with the departed shades Of things which are no more; whilst lovely concord, Follow'd by friendship sweet, and firm esteem, Your future days enrich. O heavenly friendship! Thou dost exalt the sluggish souls of men, By thee conjoin'd, to great and glorious deeds; As two dark clouds, when mix'd in middle air, With vivid lightnings flash, and roar sublime. Talk not of what is past, but future love. De Mon. (with dignity). No, Freberg, no, it must not. (To Rezenvelt.) No, my lord, I will not offer you an hand of concord, And poorly hide the motives which constrain me. I would that, not alone, these present friends, But ev'ry soul in Amberg were assembled, That I, before them all, might here declare I owe my spared life to your forbearance. (Holding out his hand.) Take this from one who boasts no feeling warmth, But never will deceive. [Jane smiles upon De Monfort with great approbation, and Rezenvelt runs up to him with open arms. Rez. Away with hands! I'll have thee to my breast. Thou art, upon my faith, a noble spirit! De Mon. (shrinking back from him). Nay, if you please, I am not so prepar'dâ My nature is of temperature too coldâ I pray you pardon me (Jane's countenance changes). But take this hand, the token of respect; The token of a will inclin'd to concord; The token of a mind, that bears within A sense impressive of the debt it owes you: And cursed be its power, unnerv'd its strength, If e'er again it shall be lifted up To do you any harm! Rez. Well, be it so, De Monfort, I'm contented; I'll take thy hand, since I can have no more. (Carelessly.) I take of worthy men whate'er they give. Their heart I gladly take, if not their hand; If that too is withheld, a courteous word, Or the civility of placid looks: And, if e'en these are too great favours deem'd, 'Faith, I can set me down contentedly With plain and homely greeting, or âGod save ye!â De Mon. (aside, starting away from him some paces). By the good light, he makes a jest of it! [Jane seems greatly distressed, and Freberg endeavours to cheer her. Freb. (to Jane). Cheer up, my noble friend; all will go well; For friendship is no plant of hasty growth. Though rooted in esteem's deep soil, the slow And gradual culture of kind intercourse Must bring it to perfection. (To the Countess.) My love, the morning, now, is far advane'd; Our friends elsewhere expect us; take your leave. Lady (to Jane). Farewell, dear madam, till the evening hour. Freb. (to De Mon.) Good day, De Monfort. (To Jane.) Most devoutly yours. Rez. (to Freb.) Go not too fast, for I will follow you. [Exeunt Freberg and his lady. (To Jane.) The Lady Jane is yet a stranger here: She might, perhaps, in this your ancient city Find somewhat worth her notice. Jane. I thank you, marquis, I am much engag'd; I go not out to-day. Rez. Then fare ye well! I see I cannot now Be the proud man who shall escort you forth, And show to all the world my proudest boast, The notice and respect of Jane de Monfort. De Mon. (aside impatiently). He says farewell, and goes not! Jane (to Rez.). You do me honour. Rez. Madam, adieu! (To Jane.) Good morning, noble marquis. [Jane and De Monfort look expressively to one another, without speaking, and then exeunt severally. ACT IV. SCENE I. A hall or antechamber, with the folding doors of an inner apartment open, which discovers the guests rising from a banquet. They enter and pass over the stage, and exeunt; and after them enter Rezenvelt and Freberg. Freb. Alas, my Rezenvelt! I vainly hop'd the hand of gentle peace, From this day's reconciliation sprung, These rude unseemly jarrings had subdu'd; But I have mark'd, e'en at the social board, Such looks, such words, such tones, such untold things, Too plainly told, 'twixt you and Monfort pass, That I must now despair. Yet who could think, two minds so much refin'd, So near in excellence, should be remov'd, So far remov'd, in gen'rous sympathy? Rez. Ay, far remov'd indeed! Freb. And yet, methought, he made a noble effort, And with a manly plainness bravely told The galling debt he owes to your forbearance. Rez. 'Faith! so he did, and so did I receive it; When, with spread arms, and heart e'en mov'd to tears, I frankly proffer'd him a friend's embrace: And, I declare, had he as such receiv'd it, I from that very moment had forborne All opposition, pride-provoking jest, Contemning carelessness, and all offence; And had caress'd him as a worthy heart, From native weakness such indulgence claiming. But since he proudly thinks that cold respect, The formal tokens of his lordly favour, So precious are, that I would sue for them As fair distinction in the public eye, Forgetting former wrongs, I spurn it all. And but that I do bear that noble woman, His worthy, his incomparable sister, Such fix'd, profound regard, I would expose him; And, as a mighty bull, in senseless rage, Rous'd at the baiter's will, with wretched rags Of ire-provoking scarlet, chafes and bellows, I'd make him at small cost of paltry wit, With all his deep and manly faculties, The scorn and laugh of fools. Freb. For heaven's sake, my friend, restrain your wrath! For what has Monfort done of wrong to you, Or you to him, bating one foolish quarrel, Which you confess from slight occasion rose, That in your breasts such dark resentment dwells, So fix'd, so hopeless? Rez. O! from our youth he has distinguish'd me With ev'ry mark of hatred and disgust. For e'en in boyish sports I still oppos'd His proud pretensions to pre-eminence; Nor would I to his ripen'd greatness give That fulsome adulation of applause A senseless crowd bestow'd. Though poor in fortune, I still would smile at vain assuming wealth: But when unlook'd-for fate on me bestow'd Riches and splendour equal to his own, Though I, in truth, despise such poor distinction, Feeling inclin'd to be at peace with him, And with all men beside, I curb'd my spirit, And sought to soothe him. Then, with spiteful rage, From small offence he rear'd a quarrel with me, And dar'd me to the field. The rest you know. In short, I still have been th' opposing rock, O'er which the stream of his o'erflowing pride Hath foam'd and fretted. Seest thou how it is? Freb. Too well I see, and warn thee to beware. Such streams have oft, by swelling floods surcharg'd, Borne down, with sudden and impetuous force, The yet unshaken stone of opposition, Which had for ages stopp'd their flowing course. I pray thee, friend, beware. Rez. Thou canst not meanâhe will not murder me? Freb. What a proud heart, with such dark passion toss'd, May, in the anguish of its thoughts, conceive, I will not dare to say. Rez. Ha, ha! thou knowst him not. Full often have I mark'd it in his youth, And could have almost lov'd him for the weakness: He's form'd with such antipathy, by nature, To all infliction of corporeal pain, To wounding life, e'en to the sight of blood, He cannot if he would. Freb. Then fie upon thee! It is not gen'rous to provoke him thus. But let us part: we'll talk of this again. Something approaches.âWe are here too long. Rez. Well, then, to-morrow I'll attend your call. Here lies my way. Good night. [Exit. Enter Conrad. Con. Forgive, I pray, my lord, a stranger's boldness. I have presum'd to wait your leisure here, Though at so late an hour. Freb. But who art thou? Con. My name is Conrad, sir, A humble suitor to your honour's goodness, Who is the more embolden'd to presume, In that De Monfort's brave and noble marquis Is so much fam'd for good and gen'rous deeds. Freb. You are mistaken, I am not the man. Con. Then, pardon me: I thought I could not err; That mien so dignified, that piercing eye Assur'd me it was he. Freb. My name is not De Monfort, courteous stranger; But, if you have a favour to request, I may, with him, perhaps, befriend your suit. Con. I thank your honour, but I have a friend Who will commend me to De Monfort's favour: The Marquis Rezenvelt has known me long, Who, says report, will soon become his brother. Freb. If thou wouldst seek thy ruin from De Monfort, The name of Rezenvelt employ, and prosper; But, if aught good, use any name but his. Con. How may this be? Freb. I cannot now explain. Early to-morrow call upon Count Freberg; So am I call'd, each burgher knows my house, And there instruct me how to do you service. Good night. [Exit. Con. (alone). Well, this mistake may be of service to me: And yet my bus'ness I will not unfold To this mild, ready, promise-making courtier; I've been by such too oft deceiv'd already. But if such violent enmity exist Between De Monfort and this Rezenvelt, He'll prove my advocate by opposition. For if De Monfort would reject my suit, Being the man whom Rezenvelt esteems, Being the man he hates, a cord as strong, Will he not favour me? I'll think of this. [Exit. SCENE II. A lower apartment in Jerome's house, with a wide folding glass door, looking into a garden, where the trees and shrubs are brown and leafless. Enter De Monfort with a thoughtful frowning aspect, and paces slowly across the stage, Jerome following behind him, with a timid step. De Monfort hearing him, turns suddenly about. De Mon. (angrily). Who follows me to this sequester'd room? Jer. I have presum'd, my lord. 'Tis somewhat late: I am inform'd you eat at home to-night; Here is a list of all the dainty fare My busy search has found; please to peruse it. De Mon. Leave me: begone! Put hemlock in thy soup, Or deadly night-shade, or rank hellebore, And I will mess upon it. Jer. Heaven forbid! Your honour's life is all too precious, sure. De Mon. (sternly). Did I not say begone? Jer. Pardon, my lord, I'm old, and oft forget. [Exit. De Mon. (looking after him, as if his heart smote him). Why will they thus mistime their foolish zeal, That I must be so stern? O, that I were upon some desert coast! Where howling tempests and the lashing tide Would stun me into deep and senseless quiet; As the storm-beaten trav'ller droops his head, In heavy, dull, lethargic weariness, And, 'mid the roar of jarring elements, Sleeps to awake no more. What am I grown? all things are hateful to me. Enter Manuel. (Stamping with his foot.) Who bids thee break upon my privacy? Man. Nay, good my lord! I heard you speak aloud, And dreamt not surely that you were alone. De Mon. What, dost thou watch, and pin thine ears to holes, To catch those exclamations of the soul, Which heaven alone should hear? Who hir'd thee, pray? Who basely hir'd thee for a task like this? Man. My lord, I cannot hold. For fifteen years, Long-troubled years, I have your servant been, Nor hath the proudest lord in all the realm, With firmer, with more honourable faith His sov'reign serv'd, than I have served you; But if my honesty be doubted now, Let him who is more faithful take my place, And serve you better. De Mon. Well, be it as thou wilt. Away with thee! Thy loud-mouth'd boasting is no rule for me To judge thy merit by. Enter Jerome hastily, and pulls Manuel away. Jer. Come, Manuel, come away; thou art not wise. The stranger must depart and come again, For now his honour will not be disturb'd. [Exit Manuel sulkily. De Mon. A stranger, saidst thou? [Drops his handkerchief. Jer. I did, good sir, but he shall go away; You shall not be disturb'd. [Stooping to lift the handkerchief. You have dropp'd somewhat. De Mon. (preventing him). Nay, do not stoop, my friend, I pray thee not! Thou art too old to stoop. I'm much indebted to thee.âTake this ringâ I love thee better than I seem to do. I pray thee do itâthank me not.âWhat stranger? Jer. A man who does most earnestly intreat To see your honour; but I know him not. De Mon. Then let him enter. [Exit Jerome. A pause. Enter Conrad. De Mon. You are the stranger who would speak with me? Con. I am so far unfortunate, my lord. That, though my fortune on your favour hangs, I am to you a stranger. De Mon. How may this be? what can I do for you?, Con. Since thus your lordship does so frankly ask The tiresome preface of apology I will forbear, and tell my tale at once, In plodding drudgery I've spent my youth, A careful penman in another's office; And now, my master and employer dead, They seek to set a stripling o'er my head, And leave me on to drudge, e'en to old age, Because I have no friend to take my part. It is an office in your native town, For I am come from thence, and I am told You can procure it for me. Thus, my lord, From the repute of goodness which you bear, I have presum'd to beg. De Mon. They have befool'd thee with a false report. Con. Alas! I see it is in vain to plead, Your mind is prepossess'd against a wretch, Who has, unfortunately for his weal, Offended the revengeful Rezenvelt. De Mon. What dost thou say? Con. What I, perhaps, had better leave unsaid. Who will believe my wrongs if I complain? I am a stranger, Rezenvelt my foe, Who will believe my wrongs? De Mon. (eagerly catching him by the coat). I will believe them! Though they were base as basest, vilest deeds, In ancient record told, I would believe them! Let not the smallest atom of unworthiness That he has put upon thee be conceal'd. Speak boldly, tell it all; for, by the light! I'll be thy friend, I'll be thy warmest friend, If he has done thee wrong. Con. Nay, pardon me, it were not well advis'd, If I should speak so freely of the man Who will so soon your nearest kinsman be. De Mon. What canst thou mean by this? Con. That Marquis Rezenvelt Has pledg'd his faith unto your noble sister, And soon will be the husband of her choice. So I am told, and so the world believes. De Mon. 'Tis false! 'tis basely false! What wretch could drop from his envenom'd tongue A tale so damn'd?âIt chokes my breathâ (Stamping with his foot.) What wretch did tell it thee? Con. Nay, every one with whom I have convers'd Has held the same discourse. I judge it not. But you, my lord, who with the lady dwell. You best can tell what her deportment speaks; Whether her conduct and unguarded words Belie such rumour. [De Monfort pauses, staggers backwards, and sinks into a chair; then starting up hastily. De Mon. Where am I now? 'midst all the cursed thoughts, That on my soul like stinging scorpions prey'd, This never came beforeâOh, if it be! The thought will drive me mad.âWas it for this She urg'd her warm request on bended knee? Alas! I wept, and thought of sister's love, No damned love like this. Fell devil! 'tis hell itself has lent thee aid To work such sorcery! (Pauses.) I'll not believe it. I must have proof clear as the noon-day sun For such foul charge as this! Who waits without? [Paces up and down, furiously agitated. Con. (aside). What have I done? I've carried this too far. I've rous'd a fierce ungovernable madman. Enter Jerome. De Mon. (in a loud angry voice). Where did she go, at such an early hour, And with such slight attendance? Jer. Of whom inquires your honour? De Mon. Why, of your lady. Said I not my sister? Jer. The Lady Jane, your sister? De Mon. (in a faltering voice). Yes, I did call her so. Jer. In truth, I cannot tell you where she went. E'en now, from the short beechen walk hard-by, I saw her through the garden-gate return. The Marquis Rezenvelt, and Freberg's countess, Are in her company. This way they come, As being nearer to the back apartments; But I shall stop them, if it be your will, And bid them enter here. De Mon. No, stop them not. I will remain unseen, And mark them as they pass. Draw back a little. [Conrad seems alarmed, and steals off unnoticed. De Monfort grasps Jerome tightly by the hand, and drawing back with him two or three steps, not to be seen from the garden, waits in silence, with his eyes fixed on the glass door. De Mon. I hear their footsteps on the grating sand: How like the croaking of a carrion bird, That hateful voice sounds to the distant ear! And now she speaksâher voice sounds cheerly tooâ Curs'd be their mirth!â Now, now, they come; keep closer still! keep steady! [Taking hold of Jerome with both hands. Jer. My lord, you tremble much. De Mon. What, do I shake? Jer. You do, in truth, and your teeth chatter too. De Mon. See! see they come! he strutting by her side. [Jane, Rezenvelt, and Countess Freberg appear through the glass door, pursuing their way up a short walk leading to the other wing of the house. See, his audacious face he turns to hers; Utt'ring with confidence some nauseous jest. And she endures it tooâOh! this looks vilely! Ha! mark that courteous motion of his arm!â What does he mean?âhe dares not take her hand! (Pauses and looks eagerly.) By heaven and hell he does! [Letting go his hold of Jerome, he throws out his hands vehemently, and thereby pushes him against the scene. Jer. Oh! I am stunn'd! my head is crack'd in twain: Your honour does forget how old I am. De Mon. Well, well, the wall is harder than I wist. Begone, and whine within. [Exit Jerome, with a sad rueful countenance. [De Monfort comes forward to the front of the stage, and makes a long pause expressive of great agony of mind. It must be so: each passing circumstance; Her hasty journey here; her keen distress Whene'er my soul's abhorrence I express'd; Ay, and that damned reconciliation, With tears extorted from me: Oh, too well! All, all too well bespeak the shameful tale. I should have thought of heaven and hell conjoin'd, The morning star mix'd with infernal fire, Ere I had thought of thisâ Hell's blackest magic, in the midnight hour, With horrid spells and incantation dire, Such combination opposite unseemly, Of fair and loathsome, excellent and base, Did ne'er produceâBut every thing is possible, So as it may my misery enhance! Oh! I did love her with such pride of soul! When other men, in gay pursuit of love, Each beauty follow'd, by her side I stay'd; Far prouder of a brother's station there, Than all the favours favour'd lovers boast. We quarrell'd once, and when I could no more The alter'd coldness of her eye endure, I slipp'd o'tip-toe to her chamber-door; And when she ask'd who gently knock'dâOh! oh! Who could have thought of this? [Throws himself into a chair, covers his face with his hand, and bursts into tears. After some time, he starts up from his seat furiously. Hell's direst torment seize the infernal villain! Detested of my soul! I will have vengeance! I'll crush thy swelling prideâI'll still thy vauntingâ I'll do a deed of blood!âWhy shrink I thus? If by some spell or magic sympathy, Piercing the lifeless figure on that wall Could pierce his bosom too, would I not cast it? [Throwing a dagger against the wall. Shall groans and blood affright me? No, I'll do it. Though gasping life beneath my pressure heav'd, And my soul shudder'd at the horrid brink, I would not flinch.âFie, this recoiling nature! O that his sever'd limbs were strew'd in air, So as I saw it not! Enter Rezenvelt behind from the glass door. De Monfort turns round, and on seeing him, starts back, then drawing his sword, rushes furiously upon him. Detested robber! now all forms are over; Now open villainy, now open hate! Defend thy life! Rez. De Monfort, thou art mad. De Mon. Speak not, but draw. Now for thy hated life! [They fight: Rezenvelt parries his thrusts with great skill, and at last disarms him. Then take my life, black fiend, for hell assists thee. Rez. No, Monfort, but I'll take away your sword, Not as a mark of disrespect to you, But for your safety. By to-morrow's eve I'll call on you myself and give it back; And then, if I am charg'd with any wrong, I'll justify myself. Farewell, strange man! [Exit. [De Monfort stands for some time quite motionless, like one stupified. Enters to him a servant: he starts. De Mon. Ha! who art thou? Ser. 'Tis I, an' please your honour. De Mon. (staring wildly at him). who art thou? Ser. Your servant Jacques. De Mon. Indeed I knew thee not. Now leave me, and when Rezenvelt is gone, Return and let me know. Ser. He's gone already. De Mon. How! is he gone so soon? Ser. His servant told me, He was in haste to go; as night comes on, And at the evening hour he purposes To visit some old friend, whose lonely mansion Stands a short mile beyond the farther wood, In which a convent is of holy nuns, Who chaunt this night a requiem to the soul Of a departed sister. For so well He loves such solemn music, he has order'd His horses onward by the usual road, Meaning on foot to cross the wood alone. So says his knave. Good may it do him, sooth! I would not walk through those wild dells alone For all his wealth. For there, as I have heard, Foul murders have been done, and ravens scream; And things unearthly, stalking through the night, Have scar'd the lonely trav'ller from his wits. [De Monfort stands fixed in thought. I've ta'en your steed, an' please you, from the field, And wait your farther orders. [De Monfort heeds him not. His hoofs are sound, and where the saddle gall'd, Begins to mend. What further must be done? [De Monfort still heeds him not. His honour heeds me not. Why should I stay? De Mon. (eagerly, as he is going). He goes alone, saidst thou? Ser. His servant told me so. De Mon. And at what hour? Ser. He 'parts from Amberg by the fall of eve. Save you, my lord! how chang'd your count'nance is! Are you not well? De Mon. Yes, I am well: begone, And wait my orders by the city wall: I'll wend that way, and speak to thee again. [Exit servant. [De Monfort walks rapidly two or three times across the stage; then seizes his dagger from the wall, looks steadfastly at its point, and exit hastily. SCENE III. Moonlight. A wild path in a wood, shaded with trees. Enter De Monfort, with a strong expression of disquiet, mixed with fear, upon his face, looking behind him, and bending his ear to the ground, as if he listened to something. De Mon. How hollow groans the earth beneath my tread! Is there an echo here? Methinks it sounds As though some heavy footstep follow'd me. I will advance no farther. Deep settled shadows rest across the path, And thickly-tangled boughs o'erhang this spot. O that a tenfold gloom did cover it, That'mid the murky darkness I might strike! As in the wild confusion of a dream, Things horrid, bloody, terrible do pass, As though they pass'd not; nor impress the mind With the fix'd clearness of reality. [An owl is heard screaming near him. (Starting.) What sound is that? [Listens, and the owl cries again. It is the screech-owl's cry. Foul bird of night! what spirit guides thee here? Art thou instinctive drawn to scenes of horror? I've heard of this. [Pauses and listens. How those fall'n leaves so rustle on the path, With whisp'ring noise, as though the earth around me Did utter secret things. The distant river, too, bears to mine ear A dismal wailing. O mysterious night! Thou art not silent; many tongues hast thou. A distant gath'ring blast sounds through the wood, And dark clouds fleetly hasten o'er the sky: O! that a storm would rise, a raging storm; Amidst the roar of warring elements I'd lift my hand and strike! but this pale light, The calm distinctness of each stilly thing, Is terrible (starting). Footsteps, and near me too! He comes! he comes! I'll watch him farther onâ I cannot do it here. [Exit. Enter Rezenvelt, and continues his way slowly from the bottom of the stage: as he advances to the front, the owl screams, he stops and listens, and the owl screams again. Rez. Ha! does the night-bird greet me on my way? How much his hooting is in harmony With such a scene as this! I like it well. Oft when a boy, at the still twilight hour, I've leant my back against some knotted oak, And loudly mimick'd him, till to my call He answer would return, and, through the gloom, We friendly converse held. Between me and the star-bespangled sky, Those aged oaks their crossing branches wave, And through them looks the pale and placid moon. How like a crocodile, or winged snake, Yon sailing cloud bears on its dusky length! And now transformed by the passing wind, Methinks it seems a flying Pegasus. Ay, but a shapeless band of blacker hue Comes swiftly after.â A hollow murm'ring wind sounds through the trees; I hear it from afar; this bodes a storm. I must not linger hereâ [A bell heard at some distance. The convent bell. 'Tis distant still: it tells their hour of prayer. It sends a solemn sound upon the breeze, That, to a fearful superstitious mind, In such a scene, would like a death-knell come. [Exit. ACT V. SCENE I. The inside of a convent chapel, of old Gothic architecture, almost dark: two torches only are seen at a distance, burning over a newly covered I have put above newly-covered instead of new-made grave, as it stands in the former editions, because I wish not to give the idea of a funeral procession, but merely that of a hymn or requiem sung over the grave of a person who has been recently buried. grave. Lightning is seen flashing through the windows, and thunder heard, with the sound of wind beating upon the building. Enter two monks. 1st monk. The storm increases: hark how dismally It howls along the cloisters. How goes time? 2nd monk. It is the hour: I hear them near at hand: And when the solemn requiem has been sung For the departed sister, we'll retire. Yet, should this tempest still more violent grow, We'll beg a friendly shelter till the morn. 1st monk. See, the procession enters: let us join. [The organ strikes up a solemn prelude. Enter a procession of nuns, with the abbess, bearing torches. After compassing the grave twice, and remaining there some time, the organ plays a grand dirge, while they stand round the grave. SONG BY THE NUNS. Departed soul, whose poor remains This hallow'd lowly grave contains; Whose passing storm of life is o'er, Whose pains and sorrows are no more; Bless'd be thou with the bless'd above, Where all is joy, and purity, and love! Let Him, in might and mercy dread, Lord of the living and the dead; In whom the stars of heav'n rejoice, And the ocean lifts its voice; Thy spirit, purified, to glory raise, To sing witn holy saints his everlasting praise! Departed soul, who in this earthly scene Hast our lowly sister been, Swift be thy way to where the blessed dwell! Until we meet thee there, farewell! farewell! Enter a young pensioner, with a wild terrified look, her hair and dress all scattered, and rushes forward amongst them. Abb. Why com'st thou here, with such disorder'd looks, To break upon our sad solemnity? Pen. Oh! I did hear through the receding blast, Such horrid cries! they made my blood run chill. Abb. 'Tis but the varied voices of the storm, Which many times will sound like distant screams: It has deceiv'd thee. Pen. O no, for twice it call'd, so loudly call'd, With horrid strength, beyond the pitch of nature; And murder! murder! was the dreadful cry. A third time it return'd with feeble strength, But o' the sudden ceas'd, as though the words Were smother'd rudely in the grappled throat, And all was still again, save the wild blast Which at a distance growl'd.â Oh! it will never from my mind depart! That dreadful cry, all i' the instant still'd: For then, so near, some horrid deed was done, And none to rescue. Abb. Where didst thou hear it? Pen. In the higher cells, As now a window, open'd by the storm, I did attempt to close. 1st monk. I wish our brother Bernard were arriv'd; He is upon his way. Abb. Be not alarm'd; it still may be deception. 'Tis meet we finish our solemnity, Nor show neglect unto the honour'd dead. [Gives a sign, and the organ plays again: just as it ceases, a loud knocking is heard without. Abb. Ha! who may this be? hush! [Knocking heard again. 2d monk. It is the knock of one in furious haste. Hush! hush! What footsteps come? Ha! brother Bernard. Enter Bernard bearing a lantern. 1st monk. See, what a look he wears of stiffen'd fear! Where hast thou been, good brother? Bern. I've seen a horrid sight! [All gathering round him and speaking at once. What hast thou seen? Bern. As on I hasten'd, bearing thus my light, Across the path, not fifty paces off, I saw a murder'd corse, stretch'd on his back, Smear'd with new blood, as though but freshly slain. Abb. A man or woman was't? Bern. A man, a man! Abb. Didst thou examine if within its breast There yet were lodg'd some small remains of life? Was it quite dead? Bern. Nought in the grave is deader. I look'd but once, yet life did never lodge In any form so laid. A chilly horror seiz'd me, and I fled. 1st monk. And does the face seem all unknown to thee? Bern. The face! I would not on the face have look'd For e'en a kingdom's wealth, for all the world! O no! the bloody neck, the bloody neck! [Shaking his head and shuddering with horror. Loud knocking heard without. Sist. Good mercy! who comes next? Bern. Not far behind I left our brother Thomas on the road; But then he did repent him as he went, And threatened to return. 2d monk. See, here he comes. Enter Brother Thomas, with a wild terrified look. 1st monk. How wild he looks! Bern. (going up to him eagerly). What, hast thou seen it too? Thom. Yes, yes! it glared upon me as it pass'd. Bern. What glared upon thee? [All gathering round Thomas, and speaking at once. O! what hast thou seen? Thom. As striving with the blast I onward came, Turning my feeble lantern from the wind, Its light upon a dreadful visage gleam'd, Which paus'd and look'd upon me as it pass'd; But such a look, such wildness of despair, Such horror-strained features, never yet Did earthly visage show. I shrank and shudder'd. If a damn'd spirit may to earth return, I've seen it. Bern. Was there any blood upon it? Thom. Nay, as it pass'd, I did not see its form; Nought but the horrid face. Bern. It is the murderer. 1st monk. What way went it? Thom. I durst not look till I had pass'd it far. Then turning round, upon the rising bank, I saw, between me and the paly sky, A dusky form, tossing and agitated. I stopp'd to mark it; but, in truth, I found 'Twas but a sapling bending to the wind, And so I onward hied, and look'd no more. 1st monk. But we must look to't; we must follow it: Our duty so commands. (To 2d monk.) Will you go, brother? (To Bernard.) And you, good Bernard? Bern. If I needs must go. 1st monk. Come, we must all go. Abb. Heaven be with you, then! [Exeunt monks. Pen. Amen! amen! Good heav'n, be with us all! O what a dreadful night! Abb. Daughters, retire; peace to the peaceful dead! Our solemn ceremony now is finish'd. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A large room in the convent, very dark. Enter the abbess, young pensioner bearing a light, and several nuns; she sets down the light on a table at the bottom of the stage, so that the room is still very gloomy. Abb. They have been longer absent than I thought: I fear he has escap'd them. 1st nun. Heaven forbid! Pen. No, no, found out foul murder ever is, And the foul murderer too. 2d nun. The good Saint Francis will direct their search; The blood so near this holy convent shed For threefold vengeance calls. Abb. I hear a noise within the inner courtâ They are return'd (listening); and Bernard's voice I hear: They are return'd. Pen. Why do I tremble so? It is not I who ought to tremble thus. 2d nun. I hear them at the door. Bern. (without). Open the door, I pray thee, brother Thomas; I cannot now unhand the prisoner. (All speak together, shrinking back from the door, and staring upon one another.) He is with them! [A folding door at the bottom of the stage is opened, and enter Bernard, Thomas, and the other two monks, carrying lanterns in their hands, and bringing in De Monfort. They are likewise followed by other monks. As they lead forward De Monfort, the light is turned away, so that he is seen obscurely; but when they come to the front of the stage, they turn the light side of their lanterns on him at once, and his face is seen in all the strengthened horror of despair, with his hands and clothes bloody. (Abbess and nuns speak at once, and start back). Holy saints be with us! Bern. (to abb.) Behold the man of blood! Abb. Of misery too; I cannot look upon him. Bern. (to nuns). Nay, holy sisters, turn not thus away. Speak to him, if, perchance, he will regard you: For from his mouth we have no utt'rance heard, Save one deep groan and smother'd exclamation, When first we seiz'd him. Abb. (to De Mon.) Most miserable man, how art thou thus? [Pauses. Thy tongue is silent, but those bloody hands Do witness horrid things. What is thy name? De Mon. (roused, looks steadfastly at the abbess for some time; then speaking in a short hurried voice). I have no name. Abb. (to Bern.) Do it thyself; I'll speak to him no more. Pen. O holy saints! that this should be the man Who did against his fellow lift the stroke, Whilst he so loudly call'd.â Still in my ears it rings: O murder! murder! De Mon. (starting). He calls again! Pen. No, he did call, but now his voice is still'd. 'Tis past. De Mon. 'Tis past. Pen. Yes, it is past! art thou not he who did it? [De Monfort utters a deep groan, and is supported from falling by the monks. A noise is heard without. Abb. What noise is this of heavy lumb'ring steps, Like men who with a weighty burthen come? Bern. It is the body: I have orders given That here it should be laid. [Enter men bearing the body of Rezenvelt, covered with a white cloth, and set it down in the middle of the room: they then uncover it. De Monfort stands fixed and motionless with horror, only that a sudden shivering seems to pass over him when they uncover the corpse. The abbess and nuns shrink back and retire to some distance, all the rest fixing their eyes steadfastly upon De Monfort. A long pause. Bern. (to De Mon.) Seest thou the lifeless corpse, those bloody wounds? See how he lies, who but so shortly since A living creature was, with all the powers Of sense, and motion, and humanity! Oh! what a heart had he who did this deed! 1st monk (looking at the body). How hard those teeth against the lips are press'd, As though he struggled still! 2nd monk. The hands too, clench'd: nature's last fearful effort. [De Monfort still stands motionless. Brother Thomas then goes to the body, and raising up the head a little, turns it towards De Monfort. Thom. Knowst thou this ghastly face? De Mon. (putting his hands before his face in violent perturbation). Oh, do not! do not! Veil it from my sight! Put me to any agony but this! Thom. Ha! dost thou then confess the dreadful deed? Hast thou against the laws of awful heaven Such horrid murder done? What fiend could tempt thee? [Pauses, and looks steadfastly at De Monfort. De Mon. I hear thy words, but do not hear their senseâ Hast thou not cover'd it? Bern. (to Thom.) Forbear, my brother, for thou seest right well He is not in a state to answer thee. Let us retire and leave him for awhile. These windows are with iron grated o'er; He is secur'd, and other duty calls. Thom. Then let it be. Bern. (to monks, &amp;c.) Come, let us all depart. [Exeunt abbess and nuns, followed by the monks, one monk lingering a little behind. De Mon. All gone! (Perceiving the monk.) O stay thou here! Monk. It must not be. De Mon. I'll give thee gold; I'll make thee rich in gold, If thou wilt stay e'en but a little while. Monk. I must not, must not, stay. De Mon. I do conjure thee! Monk. I dare not stay with thee. [Going. De Mon. And wilt thou go? [Catching hold of him eagerly. O! throw thy cloak upon this grizly form! The unclos'd eyes do stare upon me still. O do not leave me thus! [Monk covers the body, and exit. De Mon. (alone, looking at the covered body, but at a distance). Alone with thee! but thou art nothing now. 'Tis done, 'tis number'd with the things o'erpast; Would! would it were to come!â What fated end, what darkly gathering cloud Will close on all this horror? O that dire madness would unloose my thoughts, And fill my mind with wildest fantasies, Dark, restless, terrible! aught, aught but this! [Pauses and shudders. How with convulsive life he heav'd beneath me, E'en with the death's wound gor'd! O horrid, horrid! Methinks I feel him still.âWhat sound is that? I heard a smother'd groan.âIt is impossible! [Looking steadfastly at the body. It moves! it moves! the cloth doth heave and swell. It moves again! I cannot suffer thisâ Whate'er it be, I will uncover it. [Runs to the corpse, and tears off the cloth in despair. All still beneath. Nought is there here but fix'd and grizly death, How sternly fixed! Oh! those glazed eyes! They look upon me still. [Shrinks back with horror. Come, madness! come unto me, senseless death! I cannot suffer this! Here, rocky wall, Seatter these brains, or dull them! [Runs furiously, and dashing his head against the wall, falls upon the floor. Enter two monks hastily. 1st monk. See: wretched man, he hath destroy'd himself. 2d monk. He does but faint. Let us remove him hence. 1st monk. We did not well to leave him here alone. 2d monk. Come, let us bear him to the open air. [Exeunt, bearing out De Monfort. SCENE III. Before the gates of the convent. Enter Jane De Monfort, Freberg, and Manuel. As they are proceeding towards the gate, Jane stops short and shrinks back. Freb. Ha! wherefore? has a sudden illness seiz'd thee? Jane. No, no, my friend.âAnd yet I am very faintâ I dread to enter here. Man. Ay, so I thought: For, when between the trees, that abbey tower First show'd its top, I saw your count'nance change. But breathe a little here: I'll go before, And make inquiry at the nearest gate. Freb. Do so, good Manuel. [Manuel goes and knocks at the gate. Courage, dear madam: all may yet be well. Rezenvelt's servant, frighten'd with the storm, And seeing that his master join'd him not, As by appointment, at the forest's edge, Might be alarm'd, and give too ready ear To an unfounded rumour. He saw it not; he came not here himself. Jane (looking eagerly to the gate, where Manuel talks with the porter). Ha! see, he talks with some one earnestly. And seest thou not that motion of his hands? He stands like one who hears a horrid tale. Almighty God! [Manuel goes into the convent. He comes not back; he enters. Freb. Bear up, my noble friend. Jane. I will, I will! But this suspense is dreadful. [A long pause. Manuel re-enters from the convent, and comes forward slowly with a sad countenance. Is this the face of one who bears good tidings? O God! his face doth tell the horrid fact: There is nought doubtful here. Freb. How is it, Manuel? Man. I've seen him through a crevice in his door: It is indeed my master. [Bursting into tears. [Jane faints, and is supported by Freberg.â Enter abbess and several nuns from the convent, who gather about her, and apply remedies. She recovers. 1st nun. The life returns again. 2d nun. Yes, she revives. Abb. (to Freb.) Let me entreat this noble lady's leave To lead her in. She seems in great distress: We would with holy kindness soothe her woe, And do by her the deeds of christian love. Freb. Madam, your goodness has my grateful thanks. [Exeunt, supporting Jane into the convent. SCENE IV. De Monfort is discovered sitting in a thoughtful posture. He remains so for some time. His face afterwards begins to appear agitated, like one whose mind is harrowed with the severest thoughts; then, starting from his seat, he clasps his hands together, and holds them up to heaven. De Mon. O that I ne'er had known the light of day! That filmy darkness on mine eyes had hung, And clos'd me out from the fair face of nature! O that my mind in mental darkness pent, Had no perception, no distinction known, Of fair or foul, perfection or defect, Nor thought conceiv'd of proud pre-eminence! O that it had! O that I had been form'd An idiot from the birth! a senseless changeling, Who eats his glutton's meal with greedy haste, Nor knows the hand which feeds him.â [Pauses; then in a calmer sorrowful voice. What am I now? how ends the day of life? For end it must; and terrible this gloom, This storm of horrors that surrounds its close. This little term of nature's agony Will soon be o'er, and what is past is past; But shall I then, on the dark lap of earth Lay me to rest, in still unconsciousness, Like senseless clod that doth no pressure feel From wearing foot of daily passenger; Like a steep'd rock o'er which the breaking waves Bellow and foam unheard? O would I could! Enter Manuel, who springs forward to his master, but is checked upon perceiving De Monfort draw back and look sternly at him. Man. My lord, my master! O my dearest master! [De Monfort still looks at him without speaking. Nay, do not thus regard me, good my lord! Speak to me: am I not your faithful Manuel? De Mon. (in a hasty broken voice). Art thou alone? Man. No, sir, the Lady Jane is on her way; She is not far behind. De Mon. (tossing his arm over his head in an agony). This is too much! all I can bear but this! It must not be.âRun and prevent her coming. Say, he who is detain'd a prisoner here Is one to her unknown. I now am nothing. I am a man of holy claims bereft; Out of the pale of social kindred cast; Nameless and horrible.â Tell her De Monfort far from hence is gone Into a desolate and distant land, Ne'er to return again. Fly, tell her this; For we must meet no more. Enter Jane De Monfort, bursting into the chamber and followed by Freberg, abbess, and several nuns. Jane. We must! we must! My brother, O my brother! [De Monfort turns away his head and hides his face with his arm. Jane stops short, and, making a great effort, turns to Freberg, and the others who followed her, and with an air of dignity stretches out her hand, beckoning them to retire. All retire but Freberg, who seems to hesitate. And thou too, Freberg: call it not unkind. [Exit Freberg: Jane and De Monfort only remain. Jane. My hapless Monfort! [De Monfort turns round and looks sorrowfully upon her; she opens her arms to him, and he, rushing into them, hides his face upon her breast, and weeps. Jane. Ay, give thy sorrow vent; here mayst thou weep. De Mon. (in broken accents). Oh! this, my sister, makes me feel again The kindness of affection. My mind has in a dreadful storm been tost; Horrid and darkâI thought to weep no moreâ I've done a deedâBut I am human still. Jane. I know thy suff'rings: leave thy sorrow free! Thou art with one who never did upbraid; Who mourns, who loves thee still. De Mon. Ah! sayst thou so? no, no; it should not be. (Shrinking from her.) I am a foul and bloody murderer, For such embrace unmeet: O leave me! leave me! Disgrace and public shame abide me now; And all, alas! who do my kindred own, The direful portion share.âAway, away! Shall a disgrac'd and public criminal Degrade thy name, and claim affinity To noble worth like thine?âI have no nameâ I'm nothing now, not e'en to thee: depart. [She takes his hand, and grasping it firmly, speaks with a determined voice. Jane. De Monfort, hand in hand we have enjoy'd The playful term of infancy together; And in the rougher path of ripen'd years We've been each other's stay. Dark low'rs our fate, And terrible the storm that gathers o'er us; But nothing, till that latest agony Which severs thee from nature, shall unloose This fix'd and sacred hold. In thy dark prison-house; In the terrific face of armed law; Yea, on the seaffold, if it needs must be, I never will forsake thee. De Mon. (looking at her with admiration.) Heav'n bless thy gen'ro us soul, my noble Jane! I thought to sink beneath this load of ill, Depress'd with infamy and open shame; I thought to sink in abject wretchedness: But for thy sake I'll rouse my manhood up, And meet it bravely; no unseemly weakness, I feel my rising strength, shall blot my end, To clothe thy cheek with shame. Jane. Yes, thou art noble still. De Mon. With thee I am; who were not so with thee? But, ah! my sister, short will be the term: Death's stroke will come, and in that state beyond, Where things unutterable wait the soul, New from its earthly tenement discharg'd, We shall be sever'd far. Far as the spotless purity of virtue Is from the murd'rer's guilt, far shall we be. This is the gulf of dread uncertainty From which the soul recoils. Jane. The God who made thee is a God of mercy: Think upon this. De Mon. (shaking his head). No, no! this blood! this blood! Jane. Yes, e'en the sin of blood may be forgiv'n, When humble penitence hath once aton'd. De Mon. (eagerly). What, after terms of lengthen'd misery, Imprison'd anguish of tormented spirits, Shall I again, a renovated soul, Into the blessed family of the good Admittance have? Thinkst thou that this may be? Speak, if thou canst: O speak me comfort here! For dreadful fancies, like an armed host, Have push'd me to despair. It is most horribleâ O speak of hope! if any hope there be. [Jane is silent, and looks sorrowfully upon him; then clasping her hands, and turning her eyes to heaven, seems to mutter a prayer. De Mon. Ha! dost thou pray for me? heav'n hear thy prayer! I fain would kneel.âAlas! I dare not do it. Jane. Not so! all by th' Almighty Father form'd, May in their deepest misery call on Him. Come kneel with me, my brother. [She kneels and prays to herself; he kneels by her, and clasps his hands fervently, but speaks not. A noise of chains clanking is heard without, and they both rise. De Mon. Hearest thou that noise? They come to interrupt us. Jane. (moving towards a side door). Then let us enter here. De Mon. (catching hold of her with a look of horror). Not thereânot thereâthe corpse âthe bloody corpse! Jane. What, lies he there?âUnhappy Rezenvelt! De Mon. A sudden thought has come across my mind; How came it not before? Unhappy Rezenvelt! Sayst thou but this? Jane. What should I say? he was an honest man; I still have thought him such, as such lament him. [De Monfort utters a deep groan. What means this heavy groan? De Mon. It hath a meaning. Enter abbess and monks, with two officers of justice carrying fetters in their hands to put upon De Monfort. Jane (starting.) What men are these? 1st off. Lady, we are the servants of the law, And bear with us a power, which doth constrain To bind with fetters this our prisoner. [Pointing to De Monfort. Jane. A stranger uncondemn'd? this cannot be. 1st off. As yet, indeed, he is by law unjudg'd, But is so far condemn'd by circumstance, That law, or custom sacred held as law, Doth fully warrant us, and it must be. Jane. Nay, say not so; he has no power t'escape: Distress hath bound him with a heavy chain; There is no need of yours. 1st off. We must perform our office. Jane. O! do not offer this indignity! 1st off. Is it indignity in sacred law To bind a murderer? (To 2d off.) Come, do thy work. Jane. Harsh are thy words, and stern thy harden'd brow; Dark is thine eye; but all some pity have Unto the last extreme of misery. I do beseech thee! if thou art a manâ [Kneeling to him. [De Monfort, roused at this, runs up to Jane, and raises her hastily from the ground: then stretches himself up proudly. De Mon. (to Jane). Stand thou erect in native dignity; And bend to none on earth the suppliant knee, Though cloth'd in power imperial. To my heart It gives a feller gripe than many irons. (Holding out his hands.) Here, officers of law, bind on those shackles; And, if they are too light, bring heavier chains, Add iron to iron; load, crush me to the ground: Nay, heap ten thousand weight upon my breast, For that were best of all. [A long pause, whilst they put irons upon him. After they are on, Jane looks at him sorrowfully, and lets her head sink on her breast. De Monfort stretches out his hand, looks at them, and then at Jane; crosses them over his breast, and endeavours to suppress his feelings. Should this play ever again be acted, perhaps it would be better that the curtain should drop here; since here the play may be considered as completed, and what comes after, prolongs the piece too much when our interest for the fate of De Monfort is at an end. 1st off. (to De Monfort). I have it, too, in charge to move you hence, Into another chamber more sccure. De Mon. Well, I am ready, sir. [Approaching Jane, whom the abbess is endeavouring to comfort, but to no purpose. Ah! wherefore thus, most honour'd and most dear? Shrink not at the accoutrements of ill, Daring the thing itself. [Endeavouring to look cheerful. Wilt thou permit me with a gyved hand? [She gives him her hand, which he raises to his lips. This was my proudest office. [Exeunt, De Monfort leading out Jane. SCENE V. An apartment in the convent, opening into another room, whose low arched door is seen at the bottom of the stage. In one corner a monk is seen kneeling. Enter another monk, who, on perceiving him, stops till he rises from his knees, and then goes eagerly up to him. 1st monk. How is the prisoner? 2d monk (pointing to the door). He is within, and the strong hand of death Is dealing with him. 1st monk. How is this, good brother? Methought he brav'd it with a manly spirit; And led, with shackled hands, his sister forth, Like one resolv'd to bear misfortune bravely. 2d monk. Yes, with heroic courage, for a while He seem'd inspir'd; but soon depress'd again, Remorse and dark despair o'erwhelm'd his soul: And, from the violent working of his mind, Some stream of life within his breast has burst; For many a time, within a little space, The ruddy tide has rush'd into his mouth. God grant his pains be short! 1st monk. How does the lady? 2d monk. She sits and bears his head upon her lap. Wiping the cold drops from his ghastly face With such a look of tender wretchedness, It wrings the heart to see her. How goes the night? 1st monk. It wears, methinks, upon the midnight hour. It is a dark and fearful night; the moon Is wrapp'd in sable clouds; the chill blast sounds Like dismal lamentations. Ay, who knows What voices mix with the dark midnight winds? Nay, as I pass'd that yawning cavern's mouth, A whisp'ring sound, unearthly, reach'd my ear, And o'er my head a chilly coldness crept. Are there not wicked fiends and damned sprites, Whom yawning charnels, and th' unfathom'd depths Of secret darkness, at this fearful hour, Do upwards send, to watch, unseen, around The murd'rer's death-bed, at his fatal term, Ready to hail with dire and horrid welcome, Their future mate?âI do believe there are. 2d monk. Peace, peace! a God of wisdom and of mercy, Veils from our sightâHa! hear that heavy groan. [A groan heard within. 1st monk. It is the dying man. [Another groan. 2d monk. God grant him rest! [Listening at the door. I hear him struggling in the gripe of death. O piteous heaven! [Goes from the door. Enter Brother Thomas from the chamber. How now, good brother? Thom. Retire, my friends. O many a bed of death With all its pangs and horrors I have seen, But never aught like this! Retire, my friends! The death-bell will its awful signal give, When he has breath'd his last. I would move hence, but I am weak and faint: Let me a moment on thy shoulder lean. Oh, weak and mortal man! [Leans on 2d monk: a pause. Enter Bernard from the chamber. 2d monk. (to Bern.) How is your penitent? Bern. He is with Him who made him; Him, who knows The soul of man: before whose awful presence Th' unsceptred tyrant stands despoil'd and helpless, Like an unclothed babe. [Bell tolls. The dismal sound! Retire, and pray for the blood-stained soul: May heav'n have mercy on him! [Bell tolls again. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. A hall or large room in the convent. The bodies of De Monfort and Rezenvelt are discovered laid out upon a low table or platform, covered with black. Freberg, Bernard, abbess, monks, and nuns attending. Abb. (to Freb.) Here must they lie, my lord, until we know Respecting this the order of the law. Freb. And you have wisely done, my rev'rend mother. [Goes to the table, and looks at the bodies, but without uncovering them.. Unhappy men! ye, both in nature rich, With talents and with virtues were endued. Ye should have lov'd, yet deadly rancour came, And in the prime and manhood of your days Ye sleep in horrid death. O direful hate! What shame and wretchedness his portion is, Who, for a secret inmate, harbours thee! And who shall call him blameless, who excites, Ungen'rously excites, with careless scorn, Such baleful passion in a brother's breast, Whom heav'n commands to love? Low are ye laid: Still all contention now.âLow are ye laid: I lov'd you both, and mourn your hapless fall. Abb. They were your friends, my lord? Freb. I lov'd them both. How does the Lady Jane? Abb. She bears misfortune with intrepid soul. I never saw in woman, bow'd with grief, Such moving dignity. Freb. Ay, still the same. I've known her long: of worth most excellent; But in the day of woe she ever rose Upon the mind with added majesty, As the dark mountain more sublimely tow'rs Mantled in clouds and storm. Enter Manuel and Jerome. Man. (pointing). Here, my good Jerome, here's a piteous sight. Jer. A piteous sight! yet I will look upon him: I'll see his face in death. Alas, alas! I've seen him move a noble gentleman! And when with vexing passion undisturb'd, He look'd most graciously. [Lifts up in mistake the cloth from the body of Rezenvelt, and starts back with horror. Oh! this was the bloody work! Oh! oh, oh, oh! That human hands could do it! [Drops the cloth again. Man. That is the murder'd corpse; here lies De Monfort. [Going to uncover the other body. Jer. (turning away his head). No, no! I cannot look upon him now. Man. Didst thou not come to see him? Jer. Fy! cover himâinter him in the darkâ Let no one look upon him. Bern. (to Jer.) Well dost thou show the abhorrence nature feels For deeds of blood, and I commend thee well. In the most ruthless heart compassion wakes For one, who, from the hand of fellow man, Hath felt such cruelty. [Uncovering the body of Rezenvelt. This is the murder'd corse: [Uncovering the body of De Monfort. But see, I pray! Here lies the murderer. What thinkst thou here? Look on those features, thou hast seen them oft, With the last dreadful conflict of despair, So fix'd in horrid strength. See those knit brows; those hollow sunken eyes; The sharpen'd nose, with nostrils all distent; That writhed mouth, where yet the teeth appear, In agony, to gnash the nether lip. Thinkst thou, less painful than the murd'rer's knife Was such a death as this? Ay, and how changed too those matted locks! Jer. Merciful heaven! his hair is grizly grown, Chang'd to white age, that was, but two days since, Black as the raven's plume. How may this be? Bern. Such change, from violent conflict of the mind, Will sometimes come. Jer. Alas, alas! most wretched! Thou wert too good to do a cruel deed, And so it kill'd thee. Thou hast suffer'd for it. God rest thy soul! I needs must touch thy hand, And bid thee long farewell. [Laying his hand on De Monfort. Bern. Draw back, draw back: see where the lady comes. Enter Jane De Monfort. Freberg, who has been for some time retired by himself at the bottom of the stage, now steps forward to lead her in, but checks himself on seeing the fixed sorrow of her countenance, and draws back respectfully. Jane advances to the table, and looks attentively at the covered bodies. Manuel points out the body of De Monfort, and she gives a gentle inclination of the head, to signify that she understands him. She then bends tenderly over it, without speaking. Man. (to Jane, as she raises her head). Oh, madam, my good lord! Jane. Well says thy love, my good and faithful Manuel: But we must mourn in silence. Man. Alas! the times that I have followed him! Jane. Forbear, my faithful Manuel. For this love Thou hast my grateful thanks; and here's my hand: Thou hast lov'd him, and I'll remember thee. Where'er I am, in whate'er spot of earth I linger out the remnant of my days, I will remember thee. Man. Nay, by the living God! where'er you are, There will I be. I'll prove a trusty servant: I'll follow you, even to the world's end. My master's gone; and I indeed am mean, Yet will I show the strength of nobler men, Should any dare upon your honour'd worth To put the slightest wrong. Leave you, dear lady! Kill me, but say not this! [Throwing himself at her feet. Jane (raising him). Well, then! be thou my servant, and my friend. Art thou, good Jerome, too, in kindness come? I see thou art. How goes it with thine age? Jer. Ah, madam! woe and weakness dwell with age: Would I could serve you with a young man's strength! I'd spend my life for you. Jane. Thanks, worthy Jerome. O! who hath said, the wretched have no friends? Freb. In every sensible and gen'rous breast Affliction finds a friend; but unto thee, Thou most exalted and most honourable, The heart in warmest adoration bows, And even a worship pays. Jane. Nay, Freberg! Freberg! grieve me not, my friend. He, to whose ear my praise most welcome was, Hears it no more! and, oh, our piteous lot! What tongue will talk of him? Alas, alas! This more than all will bow me to the earth; I feel my misery here. The voice of praise was wont to name us both: I had no greater pride. [Covers her face with her hands, and bursts into tears. Here they all hang about her: Freberg supporting her tenderly, Manuel embracing her knees, and old Jerome catching hold of her robe affectionately. Bernard, abbess, monks, and nuns likewise gather round her, with looks of sympathy. Enter two Officers of Law. 1st off. Where is the prisoner? Into our hands he straight must be consign'd. Bern. He is not subject now to human laws; The prison that awaits him is the grave. 1st off. Ha! sayst thou so? there is foul play in this. Man. (to off.) Hold thy unrighteous tongue, or hie thee hence, Nor in the presence of this honour'd dame, Utter the slightest meaning of reproach. 1st off. I am an officer on duty call'd, And have authority to say, âHow died he?â [Here Jane shakes off the weakness of grief, and repressing Manuel, who is about to reply to the officer, steps forward with dignity. Jane. Tell them by whose authority you come, He died that death which best becomes a man, Who is with keenest sense of conscious ill And deep remorse assail'd, a wounded spirit. A death that kills the noble and the brave, And only them. He had no other wound. 1st off. And shall I trust to this? Jane. Do as thou wilt: To one who can suspect my simple word I have no more reply. Fulfil thine office. 1st off. No, lady. I believe your honour'd word, And will no further search. Jane. I thank your courtesy: thanks, thanks to all; My rev'rend mother, and ye honour'd maids; Ye holy men, and you, my faithful friends; The blessing of the afflicted rest with you! And He, who to the wretched is most piteous, Will recompense you.âFreberg, thou art good; Remove the body of the friend you lov'd: 'Tis Rezenvelt I mean. Take thou this charge: 'Tis meet, that with his noble ancestors He lie entomb'd in honourable state. And now I have a sad request to make, Nor will these holy sisters scorn my boon; That I, within these sacred cloister walls, May raise a humble, nameless tomb to him, Who, but for one dark passion, one dire deed, Had claim'd a record of as noble worth, As e'er enrich'd the sculptur'd pedestal. [Exeunt. Note. âThe last three lines of the last speech are not intended to give the reader a true character of De Monfort, whom I have endeavoured to represent throughout the play as, notwithstanding his other good qualities, proud, suspicious, and susceptible of envy, but only to express the partial sentiments of an affectionate sister, naturally more inclined to praise him from the misfortune into which he had fallen. ETHWALD: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PART FIRST. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Oswal, king of Mercia. Edward, his nephew, and ethling or heir to the crown. Seagurth, father to Edward. Ethwald. Ethelbert, a noble Thane. Selred, elder brother to Ethwald. Mollo, father to Ethwald, a Thane of small consideration. Hexulf, a bigoted bishop. Alwy, an artful adventurer.

Sigurtha, mother to Bertha, and niece to Mollo, living in his castle, with her daughter, as part of his family. Dwina, attendant on Elburga. Ladies, attendants, and female Druids. The scene is supposed to be in England, in the kingdom of Mercia, and the time near the end of the Heptarchy. ACT I. SCENE I. The court of a Saxon castle. Ethwald is discovered lying upon the ground as if half asleep. The sound of a horn is heard without, at which he raises his head a little, and lays it down again. The gate of the castle opens at the bottom of the stage, and enter Selred, Ethelbert, and attendants, as if returned from hunting. Sel. and Eth. walk forward to the front, and the others retire by different sides of the stage. Selred. This morning's sport hath bravely paid our toil. Have not my dogs done credit to their breed? Eth. I grant they have. Sel. Mark'd you that tawny hound, With stretched nostrils snuffing to the ground, Who still before, with animating yell, Like the brave leader of a warlike band, Through many a mazy track his comrades led Right in the tainted path? I would not for the weregild of a Thane That noble creature barter. Eth. I do not mean to tempt thee with the sum. Seest thou where Ethwald, like a cottage cur On dunghill stretch'd, half sleeping, half awake, Doth bask his lazy carcass in the sun? Ho! laggard there! [To Ethw., who just raises his head, and lays it down again. Eth. going up close to him. When slowly from the plains and nether woods, With all their winding streams and hamlets brown, Updrawn, the morning vapour lifts its veil, And through its fleecy folds, with soften'd rays, Like a still'd infant smiling in his tears, Looks through the early sun:âwhen from afar The gleaming lake betrays its wide expanse, And, lightly curling on the dewy air, The cottage smoke doth wind its path to heaven: When larks sing shrill, and village cocks do crow, And lows the heifer loosen'd from her stall: When heaven's soft breath plays on the woodman's brow, And every hare-bell and wild tangled flower Smells sweetly from its cage of checker'd dew: Ay, and when huntsmen wind the merry horn, And from its covert starts the fearful prey; Who, warm'd with youth's blood in his swelling veins, Would, like a lifeless clod, outstretched lie, Shut up from all the fair creation offers? (Ethw. yawns and heeds him not.) He heeds me not. Sel. I will assail him now. (In a louder voice.) Ho! heads of foxes deck our huntsman's belt, Which have through tangled woods and ferny moors With many wiles shaped out their mazy flight, Have swum deep floods, and from the rocky brows Of frightful precipices boldly leap'd Into the gulf below. Nay, e'en our lesser game hath nobly done; Across his shoulders hang four furred feet, That have full twenty miles before us run In little space. O, it was glorious! Ethw. (raising his head carelessly). Well well, I know that hares will swiftly run When dogs pursue them. (Stretches himself and goes to rest again.) Eth. Leave him to rest, he is not to be rous'd. Sel. Well, be it so. By heaven, my fretted soul Did something of this easy stupor lack, When near the latter limits of our chace I pass'd the frowning tower of Ruthergeld. He hangs a helmet o'er his battlements, As though he were the chief protecting Thane Of all the country round. I'll teach th' ennobled Ceorl, within these bounds, None may pretend in noble birth to vie With Mollo's honour'd line! Eth. (proudly). Hast thou forgot? Or didst thou never hear whose blood it is That fills these swelling veins? Sel. I cry you mercy, Thane: I little doubt Some brave man was the founder of your house. Eth. Yes, such an one, at mention of whose name The brave descendants of two hundred years Have stately ris'n with more majestic step, And proudly smiled. Sel. Who was this lordly chieftain? Eth. A Swabian shepherd's son, who, in dark times, When ruin dire menaced his native land, With all his native lordship in his grasp, A simple maple spear and osier shield, Making of keen and deep sagacity, With daring courage and exalted thoughts, A plain and native warrant of command, Around him gather'd all the valiant youth; And, after many a gallant enterprise, Repell'd the foe, and gave his country peace. His grateful country bless'd him for the gift, And offer'd to his worth the regal crown. Sel. (bowing respectfully). I yield me to thy claim. [Ethwald, who has raised himself up by degrees upon hearing the story, and listened eagerly, now starts up, impatient of the pause, and catches Eth. by the arm. Ethw. And did they crown him then? Eth. No; with a mind above all selfish wrong, He gen'rously the splendid gift refused: And drawing from his distant low retreat The only remnant of the royal race, Did fix him firmly on his father's seat; Proving until his very latest breath A true and loyal subject. [Ethwald's countenance changes, then turning from Eth. he slowly retires to the bottom of the stage and exit. Eth. follows him attentively with his eye as he retires. Eth. Mark'd you the changes of the stripling's eye? You do complain that he of late has grown A musing sluggard. Selred, mark me well: Brooding in secret, grows within his breast That which no kindred owns to sloth or ease. And is your father fix'd to keep him pent Still here at home? Doth the old wizard's prophecy, That the destruction of his noble line Should from the valour of his youngest son, In royal warfare, spring, still haunt his mind? This close confinement makes the pining youth More eager to be free. Sel. Nay, rather say, the lore he had from thee Hath o'er him cast this sullen gloom. Ere this, Where was the fiercest courser of our stalls That did not shortly under him become As gentle as the lamb? What bow so stiff But he would urge and strain his youthful strength, Till every sinew o'er his body rose, Like to the sooty forger's swelling arm, Until it bent to him? What flood so deep That on its foaming waves he would not throw His naked breast, and beat each curling surge, Until he gain'd the far opposing shore? But since he learnt from thee that letter'd art, Which only sacred priests were meant to know, See how it is, I pray! His father's house Has unto him become a cheerless den. His pleasant tales and sprightly playful talk, Which still our social meals were wont to cheer, Now visit us but like a hasty beam Between the showery clouds. Nay, e'en the maid My careful father destines for his bride, That he may still retain him here at home, Fair as she is, receives, when she appears, His cold and cheerless smile. Surely thy penanced pilgrimage to Rome, And the displeasure of our holy saint, Might well have taught thee that such sacred art Was good for priests alone. Thou'st spoilt the youth. Eth. I've spoilt the youth! What thinkst thou then of me? Sel. I'll not believe that thou at dead of night Unto dark spirits sayst unholy rhymes; Nor that the torch, on holy altars burnt, Sinks into smoth'ring smoke at thy approach; Nor that foul fiends about thy castle yell, What time the darken'd earth is rock'd with storms; Though many do such frightful credence hold, And sign themselves when thou dost cross their way. I'll not believeâ Eth. By the bless'd light of heaven !â Sel. I cannot thinkâ Eth. Nay, by this well-proved sword! Sel. Patience, good Thane! I meant to speak thy praise. Eth. My praise, sayst thou? Sel. Thy praise. I would have said, âThat he who in the field so oft hath fought, So bravely fought, and still in the honour'd cause, Should hold unhallow'd league with damned sprites, I never will believe.â Yet much I grieve That thou with bold intrusive forwardness, Hast enter'd into that which holy men Hold sacred for themselves; And that thou hast, with little prudence too, Entrapp'd my brother with this wicked lore, Although methinks thou didst not mean him harm. Eth. I thank thee, Selred; listen now to me, And thou shalt hear a plain and simple tale, As true as it is artless. These cunning priests full loudly blast my fÃ me, Because that I with diligence and cost, Have had myself instructed how to read Our sacred Scriptures, which, they would maintain, No eye profane may dare to violate. If I am wrong, they have themselves to blame; It was their hard extortions first impell'd me To search that precious book, from which they draw Their right, as they pretend, to lord it thus. But what thinkst thou, my Selred, read I there? Of one sent down from heav'n in sov'reign pomp, To give into the hands of leagued priests All power to hold th' immortal soul of man In everlasting thraldom? O far otherwise! [Taking Selred 's hand with great earnestness. Of one who health restored unto the sick, Who made the lame to walk, the blind to see, Who fed the hungry, and who rais'd the dead, Yet had no place wherein to lay His head. Of one from ev'ry spot of tainting sin Holy and pure; and yet so lenient, That He with soft and unupbraiding love Did woo the wand'ring sinner from his ways, As doth the elder brother of a house The erring stripling guide. Of one, my friend, Wiser by far than all the sons of men, Yet teaching ignorance in simple speech, As thou wouldst take an infant on thy lap And lesson him with his own artless tale. Of one so mighty That He did say unto the raging sea âBe thou at peace,â and it obeyed His voice; Yet bow'd Himself unto the painful death That we might live.âThey say that I am proudâ O! had they like their gentle master been, I would, with suppliant knee bent to the ground, Have kiss'd their very feet. But, had they been like Him, they would have pardon'd me Ere yet my bending knee had touch'd the earth. Sel. Forbear, nor tempt me with thy moving words! I'm a plain soldier, and unfit to judge Of mysteries which but concern the learn'd. Eth. I know thou art, nor do I mean to tempt thee. But in thy younger brother I had mark'd A searching mind of freer exercise, Untrammell'd with the thoughts of other men: And like to one, who, in a gloomy night, Watching alone amidst a sleeping host, Sees suddenly along the darken'd sky Some beauteous meteor play, and with his hand Wakens a kindred sleeper by his side To see the glorious sight, e'en so did I. With pains and cost I divers books procured, Telling of wars, and arms, and famous men; Thinking it would his young attention rouse; Would combat best a learner's difficulty, And pave the way at length for better things. But here his seized soul has wrapp'd itself, And from the means is heedless of the end. If wrong I've done, I do repent me of it. And now, good Selred, as thou'st seen me fight Like a brave chief, and still in th' honour'd cause, By that good token kindly think of me, As of a man who long has suffered wrong Rather than one deserving so to suffer. Sel. I do, brave Ethelbert. Eth. I thank thee, friend. And now we'll go and wash us from this dust: We are not fit at goodly boards to sit. Is not your feast-hour near? Sel. I think it is. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A small apartment in Mollo 's castle. Enter Ethwald very thoughtful, who leans against a pillar for some time without speaking. Ethw. (coming forward). Is it delusion this? Or wears the mind of man within itself A conscious feeling of its destination? What say these suddenly imposed thoughts, Which mark such deepen'd traces on the brain Of vivid real persuasion, as do make My nerved foot tread firmer on the earth, And my dilating form tower on its way? That I am born, within these narrow walls, The younger brother of a petty chief, To live my term in dark obscurity, Until some foul disease or bloody gash, In low marauding strife, shall lay me low? My spirit sickens at the hateful thought, Which hangs upon it with such thick oppression, As doth the heavy, dense, sulphureous air Upon the breath it stifles. [Pulling up the sleeve of his garment, and baring his right arm from the shoulder. A firmer strung, a stronger arm than this Own'd ever valiant chief of ancient story? And lacks my soul within, what should impel it? Ah! but occasion, like th' unveiling moon Which calls the advent'rer forth, did shine on them! I sit i' the shade! no star-beam falls on me! [Bursts into tears, and throws himself back against the pillar. A pause; he then starts forward full of animation, and tosses his arms high as he speaks. No; storms are hush'd within their silent cave, And unflesh'd lions slumber in the den, But there doth come a time! Enter Bertha, stealing softly upon him before he is aware. What, Bertha, is it thou who stealst upon me? Ber. I heard thee loud: Conversest thou with spirits in the air? Ethw. With those whose answ'ring voice thou canst not hear. Ber. Thou hast of late the friend of such become, And only them. Thou art indeed so strange, Thy very dogs have ceas'd to follow thee, For thou no more their fawning court receiv'st, Nor callest to them with a master's voice. What art thou grown, since thou hast lov'd to pore Upon those magic books? Ethw. No matter what! a hermit an' thou wilt. Ber. Nay, rather, by thy high assumed gait And lofty mien, which I have mark'd of late, Ofttimes thou art, within thy mind's own world, Some king or mighty chief. If so it be, tell me thine honour's pitch, And I will cast my regal mantle on, And mate thy dignity. [Assuming much state. Ethw. Out on thy foolery! Ber. Dost thou remember How on our throne of turf, with birchen crowns And willow branches waving in our hands, We shook our careless feet, and caroll'd out, And call'd ourselves the king and queen of Kent? Ethw. Yes, children ever in their mimic play Such fairy state assume. Ber. And bearded men Do sometimes gild the dull unchanging face Of sombre stilly life with like conceits. Come, an' you will we'll go to play again. [Tripping gaily round him. Ethw. Who sent thee here to gambol round me thus? Ber. Nay, fie upon thee! for thou knowst right well It is an errand of my own good will. Knowest thou not the wand'ring clown is here, Who doth the osier wands and rushes weave Into all shapes: who chants gay stories too; And who was wont to tell thee, when a boy, Of all the bloody wars of furious Penda? E'en now he is at work before the gate, With heaps of pliant rushes round him strew'd; In which birds, dogs, and children roll and nestle, Whilst, crouching by his side, with watchful eye The playful kitten marks each trembling rush As he entwists his many cireling bands. Nay, men and matrons, too, around him flock, And Ethelbert, low seated on a stone, With arms thus cross'd, o'erlooks his curious craft. Wilt thou not come? Ethw. Away, I care not for it! Ber. Nay, do not shake thy head, for thou must come. This magic girdle will compel thy steps. [Throws a girdle round him playfully, and pulls it till it breaks. Ethw. (smiling coldly). Thou seest it cannot hold me. [Bertha's face changes immediately: she bursts into tears, and turns away to conceal it. Ethw. (soothing her). My gentle Bertha! little foolish maid! Why fall those tears? wilt thou not look on me? Dost thou not know I am a wayward man, Sullen by fits, but meaning no unkindness? Ber. O thou wert wont to make the hall rejoice; And cheer the gloomy face of dark December! Ethw. And will, perhaps, again. Cheer up, my love! (Assuming a cheerful voice.) And plies the wandering clown his pleasing craft, Whilst dogs and men and children round him flock? Come, let us join them too. [Holding out his hand to her, whilst she smiles through her tears. How course those glancing drops adown thy cheeks, Like to a whimp'ring child! fie on thee, Bertha! [Wipes off her tears, and leads her out affectionately. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A narrow stone gallery or passage. (Voice without.) Haste, lazy comrade, there! Enter two servants by opposite sides, one of them carrying mats of rushes in his arms. 1st serv. Setst thou thy feet thus softly to the ground,â As if thou hadst been paid to count thy steps? What made thee stay so long? 2d serv. Heard you the news? 1st serv. The news? 2d serv. Ay, by the mass! sharp news indeed. And mark me well! beforehand I have said it; Some of those spears now hanging in the hall Will wag i' the field ere long. 1st serv. Thou hast a marv'llous gift of prophecy. I know it well; but let us hear thy news. 2d serv. Marry! the Britons and their restless prince, Join'd with West Anglia's king, a goodly host, Are now in Mercia, threat'ning all with ruin. And over and besides, God save us all! They are but five leagues off. 'Tis true. And over and besides again, Our king is on his way to give them battle. Ay, and moreover all, if the late floods Have broken down the bridge, as it is fear'd He must perforce pass by our castle walls, And then thou shalt behold a goodly show! 1st serv. Who brought the tidings? 2d serv. A soldier sent on horseback, all express: E'en now I heard him tell it to the Thane, Who caution'd me to tell it unto none, That Ethwald might not hear it. 1st serv. And thou in sooth obeyst his caution well. Now hear thou this from me; thou art a lout; And over and besides a babbling fool; Ay, and moreover all, I'll break thy head If thou dost tell again, in any wise, The smallest tittle of it. 2d serv. Marry! I can be secret as thyself! I tell not those who blab. 1st serv. Yes, yes, thy caution is most scrupulous; Thou'lt whisper it in Ethwald's hither ear, And bid the further not to know of it. Give me those trusses. 2d serv. Yes, this is made for my old master's seat, And this, so soft, for gentle lady Bertha. (Giving the mats.) And this, and this, and this for Ethelbert. But see thou put a sprig of mountain-ash Beneath it snugly. Dost thou understand? 1st serv. What is thy meaning? 2d serv. It hath a power to cross all wicked spells; So that a man may sit next stool to th' devil, If he can lay but slily such a twig Beneath his seat, nor suffer any harm. 1st serv. I wish there were some herb of secret power To save from daily scath of blund'ring fools: I know beneath whose stool it should be press'd. Get thee along! the feast smokes in the hall. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Saxon hall, with the walls hung round with armour. Mollo, Ethelbert, Selred, Ethwald, Bertha, Sigurtha, and others, are discovered sitting round a table, on which stand goblets and flaggons &amp;c. after a feast. Eth. Nay, gentle Bertha, if thou followest him, Shear off those lovely tresses from thy head, And with a frowning helmet shade those eyes; E'en with thy prowess added to his own, Methinks he will not be surcharg'd of means To earn his brilliant fortune in the field. Ber. Nay, rather will I fill a little scrip With sick-men's drugs and salves for fest'ring wounds, And journey by his side a trav'lling leech. Sel. That will, indeed, no unmeet comrade be For one whose fortune must be earn'd with blows Borne by no substitutes. Ethw. Well jested, Thanes! But some, ere now, with fortune earn'd by blows Borne by no substitutes, have placed their mates Above the gorgeous dames of castled lords. Cheer up, sweet Bertha! For ev'ry drug ta'en from thy little scrip I'll pay thee back withâ Eth. Sticks the word in his throat. Sel. It is too great for utt'rance. Eth. Here's to your growing honour, future chief; And here is to the lofty dame who shall beâ [They all drink ironically to Ethw. and Berth. Mollo. (seriously). Here is a father's wish for thee, my son, (To Ethw.) Better than all the glare of fleeting greatness. Be thou at home the firm domestic prop Of thine old father's house, in this as honour'd As he who bears far hence advent'rous arms! Nor think thee thus debarr'd from warlike deeds: Our neighb'ring chiefs are not too peaceable, And much adventure breed in little space. Ethw. What! shall I in their low destructive strife Put forth my strength, and earn with valiant deeds The fair renown of mighty Woggarwolfe, The flower of all those heroes? Hateful ruffian! He drinks men's blood and human flesh devours! For scarce a heifer on his pasture feeds Which hath not cost a gallant warrior's life. I cry you mercy, father! you are kind, But I do lack the grace to thank you for it. [Mollo leans on the table and looks sad. Sigur. (to Mol.) Good uncle, you are sad! Our gen'rous Ethwald Contemns not his domestic station here, Though little willing to enrich your walls With spoils of petty war. Ethw. (seeing his father sad, and assuming cheerfulness). Nay, father, if your heart is set on spoil, Let it be Woggarwolfe's that you shall covet, And small persuasion may suffice to tempt me. To plunder him will be no common gain. We feasters love the flesh of well-run game: And, faith! the meanest beeves of all his herds Have hoof'd it o'er as many weary miles, With goading pike-men hollaing at their heels, As e'er the bravest antler of the woods. His very sheep too all are noble beasts, For which contending warriors have fought; And thrifty dames will find their fleece enrich'd With the productions of full many a soil. Ber. How so, my Ethwald? Ethw. Countest thou for nought Furze from the upland moors, and bearded down Torn from the thistles of the sandy plain, The sharp-tooth'd bramble of the shaggy woods And tufted seeds from the dark marsh? Good sooth; She well may triumph in no vulgar skill Who spins a coat from it. And then his wardrobe, too, of costly gear, Which from the wallets of a hundred thieves. Has been transferring for a score of years, In endless change, it will be noble spoil! [A trumpet is heard without, and Ethw. starts from his seat. Ha! 'tis the trumpet's voice! What royal leader this way shapes his route? [A silent pause. Ye answer not. and yet ye seem to know. Enter Servants in haste. Good fellows, what say ye? 1st serv. The king! the king! and with five thousand men! 2d serv. I saw his banners from the battlements Waving between the woods. 3d serv. And so did I. His spearmen onward move in dusky lines, Like the brown reeds that skirt the winter pool. Sel. Well, well, there needs not all this wond'ring din: He passes on, and we shall do our part. 1st serv. The foe is three leagues off. Sel. Hold thy fool's tongue! I want no information. [Ethwald remains for a while thoughtful, then running eagerly to the end of the hall, climbs up and snatches from the walls a sword and shield, with which he is about to run out. Mollo (tottering from his seat). O go not forth, my rash impetuous son! Say yet a term beneath thy father's root, And, were it at the cost of half my lands, I'll send thee out accoutred like a Thane. Ethw. No, reverend sire, these be my patrimony! I ask of thee no more. Ber. And wilt thou leave us? Mollo. Ay, he'll break thy heart, And lay me in the dust! [Trumpet sounds again, and Ethw. turning hastily from them, runs out. Ber. Oh! he is gone for ever! Eth. Patience, sweet Bertha! Sd. The castle gates are shut by my command, He cannot now escape. Holla, good friends! [To those without. Enter Followers. All quickly arm yourselves, and be prepared To follow me before the fall of eve. Eth. Send out my scout to climb the farther hill, And spy if that my bands are yet in sight. [Exeunt followers. Now let us try to tame this lion's whelp. Enter Servant in haste. Sel. What tidings, man? Is Ethwald at the gate? Ser. No, good my lord, nor yet within the walls. Sel. What, have they open'd to him? Ser. No, my lord, Loudly he call'd, but when it was refus'd, With glaring eyes, like an enchafed wolf, He hied him where the lowest southern wall Rises but little o'er the rugged rock; There, aided by a half-projecting stone, He scal'd its height, and holding o'er his head His sword and shield, grasp'd in his better hand, Swam the full moat. Eth. (to Sel.) O, noble youth! Did I not say, you might as well arrest The fire of heav'n within its pitchy cloud As keep him here? [Bertha faints away. Alas, poor maid! [Whilst Sigurtha and Eth. &amp;c. attend to Bertha, enter followers and retainers, and begin to take down the armour from the walls. Enter Woggarwolfe. Wog. (to Sel.) They would have shut your gate upon me now, But I, commission'd on the king's affairs, Commanded entrance. Oswal greets you, chiefs, And gives you orders, with your followers, To join him speedily. (Seeing Bertha.) What, swooning women here? Sel. Ethwald is gone in spite of all our care, And she, thou knowst, my father's niece's child, Brought up with him from early infancy. Is therein much affected. Wog. (smiling). O, it is ever thus, I know it well, When striplings are concern'd! Once on a time. A youthful chief I seiz'd in his own hall, When, on the instant, was the floor around With fainting maids and shrieking matrons strew'd, As though the end of all things had been link'd Unto my fatal grasp. Sel. (eagerly). Thou didst not slay him? Wog. (smiling contemptuously). Asks Selred if I slew mine enemy? Sel. Then, by heav'n's light, it was a ruffian's deed! Wog. I cry thee grace! wearst thou a virgin sword? Maidens turn pale when they do look on blood, And men there be who sicken at the sight, If men they may be call'd. Sel. Ay, men there be, Who sicken at the sight of crimson butchery, Yet in the battle's heat will far out-dare A thousand shedders of unkindled blood. Eth. (coming forward). Peace, Thanes! this is no time for angry words. [Bertha giving a deep sigh, Eth. and Sel. go to her and leave Wog., who heeds her not, but looks at the men taking the arms from the walls.âObserving one who hesitates between the swords. Wog. Fool, choose the other blade! That weight of steel will noble gashes make! Nay, rightly guided in a hand like thine, Might cleave a man down to the nether ribs. Sig. (to Bertha, as she is recovering). My gentle child, how art thou? Ber. And no kind hand to hold him! Eth. Be not cast down, sweet maid; he'll soon return; All are not lost who join in chanceful war. Ber. I know right well, good Thane, all are not lost. The native children of rude jarring war, Full oft returning from the field, become Beneath their shading helmets aged men: But, ah! the kind, the playful, and the gay; They who have gladden'd their domestic board, And cheer'd the winter-fire, do they return? [Shaking her head sorrowfully. I grieve you all: I will no more complain. Dear mother, lead me hence. (To Sig.) (To Sel.) I thank you, gentle Selred, this suffices. [Exit Bertha, supported by Sigurtha. Sel. (to Mollo, who has sat for some time with his face covered). What, so o'ercome, my father? Moll. I am o'ercome, my son! lend me thine arm. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. A forest: the view of an abbey with its spires in the background. Enter the King, attended by Seagurth and several Thanes and followers, some of them wounded, and their wounds bound up, as after a battle. A flourish of trumpets: the King stretches out his arm in the action of command; the trumpets cease, and they all halt. King. Companions of this rough and bloody day, Beneath the kindly shelter of this wood Awhile repose, until our eager youth Shall, from the widely spread pursuit return'd, Rejoin our standards. Brave seneschal, thou'rt weak with loss of blood; Forbear attendance. Ay, and thou, good Baldrick; And thou (to another), and all of you. Sen. No, gracious king; The sight of you, unhurt, doth make the blood That in our veins is left so kindly glow, We cannot faint. King. Thanks, noble chiefs! dear is the gain I earn, Purchas'd with blood so precious. Who are those Who hitherward in long procession move? Sen. It is the pious brethren, as I guess, Come forth to meet you from yon neighb'ring abbey, And at their head the holy Hexulf comes. Enter Hexulf and monks. Hex. Accept our humble greetings, royal sire! Victorious be your arms! and in the dust Low be your foes, as in this glorious day! Favour'd of heav'n, and of St. Alban, hail! King. I thank your kindly zeal, my rev'rend father; And from these holy brethren do accept With thanks this token of good will, not doubting That much I am beholden to your prayers. Hex. In truth, most gracious king, your armed host Has not more surely in your cause prevail'd Than hath our joint petition, offered up With holy fervour, most importunate. Soon as the heav'n-rais'd voices sweetly reach'd The echoing arches of yon sacred roofs, Saint Alban heard, and to your favour'd side Courage and strength, the soul of battle, sent; Fear and distraction to th' opposing foe. King. Ah, then, good father, and ye pious monks, Would that ye had begun your prayers the sooner! For long in doubtful scales the battle hung; And of the men who, with this morning's sun, Buckled their harness on to follow me, Full many a valiant warrior, on his back Lies stiff'ning to the wind. Hex. The wicked sprite in ev'ry armed host Will find his friends; who doubtless for a time May counterpoise the prayers of holy men. There are among your troops, I question not, Many who do our sacred rites contemn: Many who have blasphem'dâAy, good my lord; And many holding baleful heresies. Fought Ethelbert, of Sexford, in your host? King. He did, my rev'rend father, bravely fought: To him and valiant Selred, Mollo's son, Belong the second honours of the day. [Hexulf looks abashed and is silent. Enter Edward attended, who, after making his obeisance to the King, runs up eagerly to Seagurth. Edw. You are not wounded, father? Sea. No, my boy. Edw. Thanks to preserving goodness! Noble Thanes, It grieves me much to see those swathed limbs. War wears a horrid, yet alluring face. (To King.) Your friends, my lord, have done me great despite. Had they not long detain'd me on the way, I should have been with you before the battle. King. Complain not, youth; they had, in this, commands Too high to be disputed. And 'tis well, For we have had a rough and bloody day. Edw. Ha! is it so? But you have been victorious. How went the field? Sea. Loud rose our battle's sound, and for a while The Mercians bravely fought; when all at once, From some unlook'd-for cause, as yet unknown, A powerful panic seiz'd our better wing, Which, back recoiling, turn'd and basely fled. Touch'd quickly with a seeming sympathy, Our centre-force began, in relax'd strength, To yield contended space.âSo stood the field; When on a sudden, like those warrior spirits, Whose scatter'd locks the streamy light'ning is, Whose spear the bolt of heaven; such as the seer In 'tranced gaze beholds midst hurtling storms; Rush'd forth a youth unknown, and in a pass, Narrow and steep, took his determin'd stand. His beck'ning hand and loud commanding voice Constrain'd our flying soldiers from behind, And the sharp point of his opposing spear Met the pale rout before. The dark returning battle thicken'd round him. His mighty arm deeds of amazement wrought; Rapid, resistless, terrible. High rose each warlike bosom at the sight, And Mercia, like a broad increasing wave, Up swell'd into a hugely billow'd height, O'erwhelming in its might all lesser things, Upon the foe return'd. Selred and Ethelbert Fell on their weaken'd flank. Confusion, then, And rout and horrid slaughter fill'd the field: Wide spread the keen pursuit; the day is ours; Yet many a noble Mercian strews the plain. Edw. (eagerly). But the young hero fell not? Sea. No, my son. Edw. Then bless'd be heaven! there beats no noble heart Which shall not henceforth love him as a brother. Would he were come unhurt from the pursuit! O that I had beheld him in his might, When the dark battle turn'd! Sea. Your wish is soon fulfill'd, my eager boy; For here, in truth, the youthful warrior comes, And, captive by his side, the British Prince. Enter Ethwald with the British Prince prisoner, accompanied by Selred and Ethelbert, and presents his prisoner to the King. King (to Prince). Prince of the Britons, clear thy cloudy brow; The varied fate of war the bravest prove. And though I might complain that thy aggressions Have burnt my towns, and filled my land with blood, Thy state forbids it. Here, good seneschal, Receive your charge, and let him know no change Unsuited to a prince. (To Ethwald.) And thou, brave warrior, whose youthful arm Has brought unto thy king so high a gift, Say what proud man may lift his honour'd head, And boast he is thy father. Ethw. A Thane, my lord, forgotten and retired; I am the youngest son of aged Mollo, And Ethwald is my name. King. Youngest in years, though not in honour, youth, E'en though the valiant Selred is thy brother. (Turning to Selred.) And now be thou the first and noble root, From which a noble race shall take its growth, Wearing thy honours proudly! Of Mairnieth's earldom be henceforth the lord! For well I know the council of the states Will not refuse to ratify my grant. And thou, brave Ethelbert, and Selred, too, Ye well have earn'd a noble recompense, And shall not be forgot. Come hither, Edward; Take thou this hero's hand; and, noble Ethwald, Thus let the kingdom's ethling join with me In honouring thy worth. Edw. (who has gazed at some distance upon Ethwald, springing forward eagerly). Give him my hand, my lord! have you not said That I should fold him to my burning heart? (Embraces Ethw.) Most valiant Ethwald, Fain would I speak the thoughts I bear to thee, But they do choke and flutter in my throat, And make me like a child. (Passing his hand across his eyes.) Ethw. (kissing Edward 's hand). I am repaid beyond a kingdom's worth. Edw. (to Sea. bounding joyfully). Father, have you embraced him? Ethwald, my father is a valiant man. (Sea. embraces Ethw., but not so eagerly as Edw.) King. (to Ethw.) Brave youth, with you, and with your noble friends, I shall, ere long, have further conference. (Retires to the bottom of the stage with Hexulf.) [Edward, after gazing with admiration upon Ethw., puts his hand upon his head, as if to measure his height; then upon both his shoulders, as if he were considering the breadth of his chest; then steps some paces back and gazes at him again. Edw. How tall and strong thou art! broad is thy chest: Stretch forth, I pray, that arm of mighty deeds. Ethw. smiles and stretches out his arm; Edw. looks at it, and then at his own. Would I were nerv'd like thee! (Taking Ethw.'s sword.) It is of weight to suit no vulgar arm. (Returning it.) There, hero; graceful is the sword of war In its bold master's grasp. Ethw. Nay, good my lord, if you will honour me, It does become too well your noble hand To be return'd to mine. Edw. Ha! sayst thou so? Yes, I will keep thy pledge. Perhaps my armâAh, no! it will not be! But what returning token can I give? I have bright spears and shields and shining blades But nought ennobled by the owner's use. [Takes a bracelet from his arm and fastens it round Ethwald's. King (advancing from the bottom of the stage). My worthy chiefs and Thanes, the night wears on, The rev'rend bishop, and these pious men, Beneath their fane give hospitality, And woo us to accept it for the night. Sea. I thought, my lord, you meant to pass the night With your brave soldiers in the open field: Already they have learnt the pleasing tale. Shall I unsay it? King. Nay, that were unfit. I pray you pardon me, my rev'rend father! I cannot house with you; it were unfit. Hex. Should not your greatness spend the night with those To whom, in truth, you owe the victory? We chant at midnight to St. Alban's praise: Surely my lord regards those sacred things. [Whispers the King. King. Brave Seagurth, there are reasons of good weight Why I should lay aside my first intent. Let all these wounded chieftains follow me! The rest who list may keep the open field. (To Edw.) Nephew, thou must not prove a soldier's hardships, Ere thou hast earn'd a soldier's name. Nay, nay, It must be so. [Exeunt King, wounded chiefs, Hexulf, and monks, followed by Edward very unwillingly. Sea. Who loves a soldier's pillow, follow me. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The outside of Mollo's castle. Bertha, Sigurtha, and others discovered on the walls, and several servants and retainers standing by the gate below. Berth. O, will they ne'er appear? I'll look no more; Mine eager gazing but retards their coming. [Retires, and immediately returns again. Holla, good Murdoch! (To a servant below.) Thou putst thy hand above thy sunned eyes. Dost thou descry them? 1st serv. Mercy, gentle lady, If you descry them not from that high perch, How should I from my level station here? Sig. (to Berth.) Go in, my child, thou art worn out with watching. [Berth. retires, and 2d servant goes at some distance from the walls and looks out another way. 2d serv. Here comes the noble Selred. (All call out.) Noble Selred! Berth. (returning upon the wall). What, Ethwald, say ye? Sig. No, it is Selred. Enter Selred, with followers, and looks up to the walls, where Sigurtha waves her hand. Sig. Welcome, brave Selred! welcome all thy band! How far are they behind for whom we watch? Sel. Two little miles or less. Methinks ere this Their van should be in sight. My messenger Inform'd you? Sig. Oh, he did! Sel. Where is my father? Sig. He rests within, spent with a fearful joy, And silent tears steal down his furrow'd cheeks. Sel. I must confer with him. The king intends To stop and do him honour on his march, But enters not our walls. [Exeunt into the castle. SCENE III. A chamber in the castle. Enter Sigurtha and Bertha, speaking as they enter. Berth. Nay, mother, say not so: was he not wont, If but returning from the daily chase, To send an upward glance unto that tower? There well he knew, or late or cold the hour, His eye should find me. Sig. My gentle Bertha, be not thus disturb'd. Such busy scenes, such new unlook'd-for things Ruffle the flowing stream of habit; men Will then forgetful seem, though not unkind. Berth. Thinkst thou? (shaking her head.) I saw him by his sovereign stand, And O, how graceful! every eye to him Was turn'd, and every face smil'd honours on him! Yet his proud station quickly did he leave To greet his humbler friends who stood aloof. The meanest follower of these walls, already, Some mark of kind acknowledgment hath hadâ He look'd not upâI am alone forgotten! Sig. Be patient, child: he will not long delay To seek thee in thy modest privacy; Approving more to see thee here retired, Than, boldly to the army's eye exposed, Greeting his first approach. I, the mean while, Intrusted am with orders from the Thane. Which must not be neglected. [Exit. Berth. (after walking up and down, agitated, and frequently stopping to listen). Ah, no! deceiv'd again! I need not listen! No bounding steps approach. [She sits down despondingly. Enter Ethwald behind, and steals softly up to her. Ethw. Bertha! Berth. (starting up). My Ethwald! [He holds out his arms to her joyfully, and she bursts into tears. Ethw. Thou dost not grieve that I am safe return'd? Berth. O no! I do not grieve, yet I must weep. Hast thou in truth been kind? I will not chide: I cannot do it now. Ethw. O, fie upon thee! like a wayward child: To look upon me thus! cheer up, my love. [He smiles upon her joyfully, and her countenance brightens. She then puts her hand upon his arm, and, stepping back a little space, surveys him with delight. Berth. Thou man of mighty deeds! Thou, whom the brave shall love and princes honour! Dost thou, in truth, return to me again, Mine own, my very Ethwald? Ethw. No, that were paltry; I return to thee A thousandfold the lover thou hast known me. I have of late been careless of thee, Bertha. The hopeless calm of dull obscurity, Like the thick vapours of a stagnant pool, Oppress'd my heart and smother'd kind affections; But now th' enlivening breeze of fortune wakes My torpid soulâWhen did I ever fold thee To such a warm and bounding heart as this? [Embraces her. The king has given to me Mairnieth's earldomâ Nay, smile, my Bertha! Berth. So I do, my Ethwald. Ethw. The noble ethling greatly honours me With precious tokens; nay, the very soldiers Do rear their pointed weapons as I pass; As though it were to say, âthere goes the man That we would cheerly follow.â Unto what end these fair beginnings point I know notâbut of this I am assured, There is a course of honour lies before me, Be it with dangers, toil, or pain beset, Which I will boldly tread. Smiles not my love? Berth. I should, in truth; but how is this? methinks Thou ever lookst upon the things to come, I on the past. A great and honour'd man I know thou'lt be: but O, bethink thee, then, How once thou wert, within these happy walls, A little cheerful boy, with curly pate, Who led the infant Bertha by the hand, Storing her lap with ev'ry gaudy flower; With speckled eggs stolen from the hedgeling's nest, And berries from the tree; ay, think on this, And then I know thou'lt love me! [Trumpet sounds. Catching hold of him eagerly. Hearst thou that sound? The blessed saints preserve thee! Must thou depart so soon? Ethw. Yes, of necessity: reasons of weight Constrain the king, and I, new in his service, Must seem to follow him with willing steps. But go thou with me to the castle gate. We will not part until the latest moment. Berth. Yet stop, I pray, thou must receive my pledge. Seest thou this woven band of many dyes, Like to a mottled snake? its shiny woof Was whiten'd in the pearly dew of eve, Beneath the silver moon; its varied warp Was dyed with potent herbs, at midnight cull'd. It hath a wond'rous charm: the breast that wears it No change of soft affection ever knows. Eth. (receiving it with a smile). I'll wear it, Bertha. [Trumpet sounds. Hark! it calls me hence. Berth. O go not yet! here is another gift, This ring, enrich'd with stone of basilisk, Whenever press'd by the kind wearer's hand, Presents the giver's image to his mind. Wilt thou not wear it? Ethw. (receiving it). Yes, and press it too. Berth. And in this purseâ [Taking out a purse Ethw. What! still another charm? [Laughing. Thou simple maid! Dost thou believe that witched gear like this Hath power a lover faithful to retain, More than thy gentle self? Berth. Nay, laugh, but wear them. Ethw. I will, my love, since thou wilt have it so. (Putting them in his breast.) Here are they lodged, and cursed be the hand That plucks them forth! And now receive my pledge. It is a jewel of no vulgar worth: (Ties it on her arm.) Wear it and think of me. But yet, belike, It must be steeped in some wizard's pot, Or have some mystic rhyming mutter'd o'er it, Ere it will serve the turn. Berth. (pressing the jewel on her arm). O no! right well I feel there is no need. Ethw. Come, let us go: we do not part, thou knowst, But at the castle gate. Cheer up, my Bertha! I'll soon return, and oft return again. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An apartment in a royal castle. Enter Ethwald and Alwy, speaking as they enter. Ethw. What, peace! peace, sayst thou, with these glorious arms, In conquest red, occasion bright'ning round us, And smiling victory, with beck'ning hand, Pointing to future fields of nobler strife, With richer honours crown'd? What, on the face Of such fair prospects draw the veil of peace! Cold blasting peace! The blackest fiend of hell Hath not a thought more dev'lish! Alwy. It is indeed a flat unpleasant tale For a young warrior's ear: but well hast thou Improv'd the little term of bold occasion; Short while thou wert but Mollo's younger son, Now art thou Mairnieth's lord. Ethw. And what is Mairnieth's lordship! I will own That, to my distant view, such state appear'd A point of fair and noble eminence; But nowâwhat is it now? O! it is sunk Into a petty knoll! I am as one Who doth attempt some lofty mountain's height, And having gain'd what to the upcast eye The summit's point appear'd, astonish'd sees Its cloudy top, majestic and enlarged, Towering aloft, as distant as before. Alwy. Patience, brave Ethwald; ere thy locks be grey, Thy helmed head shall yet in battle tower, And fair occasion shape thee fair reward. Ethw. Ere that my locks be grey! the world ere now Hath crouch'd beneath a beardless youth. But Iâ I am as one who mounts to th' azure sky On the rude billow's back, soon sunk again: Like the loud thunder of th' upbreaking cloud, The terror of a moment. Fate perverse! 'Till now, war's frowning spirit, rous'd, was wont To urge with whirling lash his sable steeds, Nor slack his furious speed till the wide land From bound to bound beneath his axle shook. But soon as in my hand the virgin spear Had flesh'd its ruddy point, then is he turn'd Like a tired braggart to his caves of sloth. (Stamping on the ground.) Peace! cursed peace! Who will again unchain The grizly dog of war? Alwy. Meanst thou the British prince? Ethw. (eagerly). What sayst thou, Alwy? Alwy. I said not aught. Ethw. Nay, marry! but thou didst! And it has rais'd a thought within my mind. The British prince releas'd, would he not prove A dog of war, whose yell would soon be follow'd? Alwy. They do indeed full hard advantage take Of his captivity, and put upon him Conditions suited to his hapless state, More than his princely will. Ethw. 'Tis basely done: would that some friendly hand His prison would unbar and free the thrall! But no, no, no! I to the king resign'd him; 'Twere an unworthy deed. Alwy. It were most difficult; For now they keep him in a closer hold, And bind his hands with iron. Ethw. Have they done this? I'm glad on't! O I'm glad on't! They promised nought unworthy of a prince To put upon himâNow my hands are free! And, were it made of living adamant, I will unbar his door. Difficult, sayst thou? No, this hath made it easy. Alwy. Well softly then; we may devise a way By which the seneschal himself will seem The secret culprit in this act. Ethw. No, no! I like it not; though I must work i' the dark, I'll not in cunningly devised light Put on my neighbour's cloak to cause his ruin. But let's to work apace! the storm shall rise! My sound shall yet be heard! Alwy. Fear not, thou shalt ere long be heard again, A dark'ning storm which shall not soon be lay'd. Ethw. Ah, thou hast touch'd where my life's life is cell'd! Is there a voice of prophecy within thee? [Catching hold of his arm eagerly. I will believe there is! my stirring soul Leapt at thy words. Such things ere now have been: Men oft have spok'n, unweeting, of themselves; Yea, the wild winds of night have utter'd words, That have unto the list'ning ear of hope Of future greatness told, ere yet the thoughts On any certain point had fix'd their hold. Alwy. Thou mayst believe it: I myself, methinks, Feel secret earnest of thy future fortune; And please myself to think my friendly hand May humbly serve, perhaps, to build thy greatness. Ethw. Come to my heart, my friend! though new in friendship, Thou, and thou only, bearst true sympathy With my aspiring soul. I can with thee Unbar my mindâMethinks thou shiv'rest, Alwy. Alwy. 'Tis very cold. Ethw. Is it? I feel it not: But in my chamber burns the crackling oak, There let us go. Alwy. If you are so inclin'd. [As they are going, Ethw. stops short, and catches hold of Alwy eagerly. Ethw. A sudden fancy strikes me: Woggarwolfe, That restless ruffian, might with little art Be rous'd on Wessex to commit aggression: Its royal chief, now leaguing with our king, Will take the field again. Alwy. We might attempt him instantly: but move, In faith I'm cold! [Exeunt. SCENE V. A dark apartment in the same castle. Woggarwolfe is discovered asleep upon a couch of rushes, and covered with a mat. Enter Alwy and a follower, with a lad bearing a torch before them. Alwy signs with his hand, and the torch-bearer retires to a distance. Alwy. Softly, ere we proceed; a sudden thought, Now crossing o'er my mind, disturbs me much. He who to-night commands the farther watch, Canst thou depend upon him? Fol. Most perfectly; and, free of hostile bounds, The British prince ere this pursues his way. Alwy. I'm satisfied: now to our present purpose. [As they advance towards the couch, Woggarwolfe is heard speaking in his sleep. Ha! speaks he in his sleep? some dream disturbs him: His quiv'ring limbs beneath the cov'ring move. He speaks again. Wog. (in his sleep). Swift, in your package stow those dead men's gear, And loose their noble coursers from the stall. Alwy. Ay, plund'ring in his sleep. Wog. Wipe thou that blade: Those bloody throats have drench'd it to the hilt. Alwy. O, hear the night-thoughts of that bloody hound! I must awake him. Ho, brave Woggarwolfe! Wog. Hear how those women scream! we'll still them shortly. Alwy. Ho, Woggarwolfe! Wog. Who calls me now? cannot you master it? [Alwy knocks upon the ground with his stick. What, batt'ring on it still? Will it not yield? Then fire the gate. Alwy (shaking him). Ho, Woggarwolfe, I say! Wog. (starting up half awake). Is not the castle taken? Alwy. Yes, it is taken. Wog. (rubbing his eyes). Pooh! it is but a dream. Alwy. But dreams full oft are found of real events The forms and shadows. There is in very deed a castle taken, In which your Wessex foes have left behind Nor stuff, nor store, nor make of living thing. Bind on thy sword and call thy men to arms! Thy boiling blood will bubble in thy veins, When thou hast heard it is the tower of Boruth. Wog. My place of strength? Fol. Yes, chief; I spoke with one new from the West, Who saw the ruinous broil. Wog. By the black fiends of hell! therein is stored The chiefest of my wealth. Upon its walls The armour of a hundred fallen chiefs Did rattle to the wind. Alwy. Now will it sound elsewhere. Wog. (in despair). My noble steeds, and all my stalled kine! O, the fell hounds! no mark of living thing? Fol. No mark of living thing. Wog. Ah! and my little arrow-bearing boy! He whom I spared amidst a slaughter'd heap, Smiling all weetless of th' uplifted stroke Hung o'er his harmless head! Like a tamed cub I rear'd him at my feet: He could tell biting jests, bold ditties sing, And quaff his foaming bumper at the board, With all the the mock'ry of a little man. By heav'n I'll leave alive within their walls Nor maid, nor youth, nor infant at the breast, If they have slain that child! blood-thirsty ruffians! Alwy. Ay, vengeance! vengeance! rouse thee like a man! Occasion tempts; the foe, not yet return'd, Have left their castle careless of defence. Call all thy followers secretly to arms: Set out upon the instant. Wog. By holy saints, I will! reach me, I pray! [Pointing to his arms lying at a little distance from him. Alwy (giving them). There, be thou speedy. Wog. (putting on his armour). Curse on those loosen'd springs, they will not catch! Oh, all the goodly armour I have lost! Light curses on my head! if I do leave them Or spear, or shield, or robe, or household stuff, Or steed within their stalls, or horn or hoof Upon their grassy hills! (Looking about.) What want I now? Mine armour-man hath ta'en away my helmâ Faith, and my target too! hell blast the buzzard! [Exit furiously. Alwy (laughing). Ethwald, we have fulfill'd thy bidding well, With little cost of craft! But let us follow, And keep him to the bent. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. A small close grove, with a steep rocky bank at one end of it. Several Peasants are discovered standing upon the bank, as if looking at some distant sight. 1st peas. Good lack a day! how many living souls, In wide confused eddying motion mix'd, Like cross set currents on the restless face Of winter floods! 2d peas. Where fight the Northern Mercians? 1st peas. On the right. The gentle ethling, as I am inform'd, Fights likewise on the right: heav'n spare his head! 'Tis his first battle. 3d peas. Hear, hear! still louder swells that horrid sound. 1st peas. Ay, many voices join in that loud din, Which soon shall shout no more. 3d peas. Ay, good neighbour, Full gloriously now looks that cover'd field, With all those moving ranks and glitt'ring arms; But he who shall return by setting sun Will see a sorry sight. [A loud distant noise. 1st peas. Heav'n save us all! it is the warlike yell Of those damn'd Britons that increaseth so. By all the holy saints our men are worsted! [An increasing noise heard without. Look! yonder look! they turn their backs and flee. 3d peas. O blasting shame! where fights brave Ethwald now? He is, I fear, far in the distant wing. Let us be gone! we are too near them here: The flight comes this way: hear that horrid sound! The saints preserve us! [The sound of the battle increases, and is heard nearer. The peasants come hastily down from the bank, and exeunt. Enter Edward with several followers disordered and panicstricken. 1st fol. (looking round). They cease to follow us: this tangled grove Has stopp'd the fell pursuit: here may we rest. [Edward throws himself down at the root of a tree, and covers his face with his hands. 2d fol. (filling his helmet with water from a stream, and presenting it to Edw.) My prince, this cooling water will refresh you. Edw. (keeping his face still covered with one hand, and waving him off with the other). Away, away! and do not speak to me! [A deep pause, the noise of the battle is again heard coming nearer. 1st fol. We must not tarry here. (To Edw.) My lord, the farther thickets of this wood Will prove a sure concealment: shall we move? Edw. (still covering his face). Let the earth gape and hide me. (Another deep pause. 3d fol. to 1st. The sin of all this rout falls on thy head, Thou cursed Thane! thou and thy hireling knaves First turn'd your backs and fled. 1st fol. to 3d. Thou liest, foul tongue! it was thy kinsman there Who first did turn; for I was borne away, [Pointing to 4th fol. Unwillingly away, by the rude stream Of his fear-stricken bands. When, till this hour, Did ever armed Briton see my back? 4th fol. Arm'd Britons dost thou call them?â devils they are! Thou knowst right well they deal with wicked sprites. Those horrid yells were not the cries of men; And fiends of hell look'd through their flashing eyes. I fear to face the power of simple man As little as thyself. Enter more Fugitives. 1st fol. (to Edw.) Up, my good lord! Hence let us quickly move; We must not stay. Edw. Then thrust me through and leave me. I'll flee no more. (Looking up wildly, then fixing his eyes wistfully upon 3d follower, and bending one knee to the ground.) Ebbert, thy sword is keen, thy arm is strong; O, quickly do't! and I shall be with those Who feel nor shame nor panic. [3d fol. and several others turn their faces away and weep. Enter more fugitives. 1st fol. What, is all lost? 1st fug. Yes, yes! our wing is beaten. Seagurth alone, with a few desp'rate men, Still sets his aged breast against the storm: But thick the aimed weapons round him fly, Like huntsmen's arrows round the toiled boar. And he will soon be nothing. Edw. (starting up). O, God! O, living God! my noble father! He has no son!âOff, ye debasing fears! I'll tear thee forth, base heart, if thou dost let me. [Coming forward and stretching out his arms. Companions, noble MerciansâAh, false word! I may not call you noble. Yet, perhaps, One gen'rous spark within your bosom glows. Sunk in disgrace still lower than ye all, I may not urgeâWho lists will follow me! All with one voice. We will all follow thee! Edw. Will ye, in truth? then we'll be brave men still. [Brandishing his sword as he goes off. My noble father! [Exeunt, clashing their arms. SCENE II. A confused noise of a battle is heard. The scene draws up and discovers the British and Mercian armies engaged. Near the front of the stage they are seen in close fight, and the ground strewed with several wounded and dead soldiers, as if they had been fighting for some time. Farther off, missile weapons and showers of arrows darken the air, and the view of the more distant battle is concealed in thick clouds of dust. The Mercians gain ground upon the Britons; and loud cries are raised by them to encourage one another. An active Mercian falls, and their progress is stopped whilst they endeavour to bear him off. Fallen Mercian. I'm slain, I'm slain! tread o'er me, and push forward. Mer. Chief. O stop not thus! to it again, brave Mercians! [The Mercians push on, encouraging one another with cries and clashing of arms; one of their bravest soldiers is wounded on the front of the stage and staggers backwards. Wounded Mer. Ay, this is death; O that my life had held To see the end of this most noble game! [Falls down, but seeing the Mercians about to push the Britons off the stage, raises himself half from the ground and claps his hands exultingly. Well fought, brave Mercians! On, my noble Mercians! [Sinks down again. I am in darkness now! a clod o' the earth! [Dies. Britons (without). Fresh succour, Britons! courage! victory! Carwallen and fresh succour! [The Britons now raise a terrible yell, and push back the Mercians, who yield ground and become spiritless and relaxed as their enemy becomes bolder. The Britons at last seize the Mercian standard, and raise another terrible yell, whilst the Mercians give way on every side. 1st falling Mer. Horror and death! the hand of wrath is o'er us! 2d falling Mer. A fell and fearful end! a bloody lair! The trampling foe to tread out brave men's breath. [The Britons yell again, and the Mercians are nearly beat off the stage. (Voice without.) Ethwald! the valiant Ethwald! succour, Mercians! (Voice within.) Hear ye, brave comrades? Ethwald is at hand. Enter Ethwald with his sword drawn. Ethw. What, soldiers! yield ye thus, while vict'ry smiles And bids us on to th' bent? Your northern comrades Mock at their savage howls, and drive before them These chafed beasts of prey. Come! to it bravely! To it, and let their mountain matrons howl, For these will soon be silent. Give me the standard. Voice. They have taken it. Ethw. Taken! no, by the spirits of the brave! Standard of ours on Snowdon winds to float! No! this shall fetch it back! [Taking off his helmet and throwing it into the midst of the enemy, then rushing upon them bare-headed and sword in hand. The Mercians clash their arms and raise a great shout: the Britons are driven off the stage; whilst many of the dying Mercians clap their hands and raise a feeble shout after their comrades. The scene closes. SCENE III. An open space before a royal tent; the curtains of which are drawn up, and show a company of warriors and dames within it. On either side of the open stage soldiers are drawn up in order. Enter two petty Thanes on the front of the stage. 1st Thane. Here let us stand and see the ceremony. Without the tent, 'tis said the king will crown The gallant ethling with a wreath of honour, As the chief agent in this victory O'er stern Carwallen and his Britons gain'd. 2d Thane. Thou sayest well. Within the royal tent They wait, as I am told, the ethling's coming, Who is full tardy. Softly, they come forth. Probably I have received this idea from Samson Agonistes, where Dalilah is compared to a stately ship of Tarsus âwith all her bravery on, and tackle trim,â &amp;c. How like a ship with all her goodly sails Spread to the sun, the haughty princess moves! [A flourish of trumpets. Enter from the tent the King, with Ethelbert, Edrick, Thanes, and attendants; and Elburga, with Dwina and ladies. They advance towards the front of the stage. King. Nay, sweet Elburga, clear thy frowning brow; He who is absent will not long delay His pleasing duty here. Elb. On such a day, my lord, the brave I honour, As those who have your royal arms maintain'd In war's iron field, such honour meriting. What individual chiefs, or here or absent, May therein be concern'd, I little care; I deign not to regard it. King. Thou art offended, daughter, but unwisely. Plumed with the fairest honours of the field, Such pious grief for a brave father's death, Bespeaks a heart such as a gentle maid In her faith-plighted lord should joy to find. Elb. Who best the royal honours of a prince Maintains, best suits a royal maiden's love. King. Elburga, thou forgetst that gentleness Which suits thy gentle kind. Elb. (with much assumed stateliness). I hope, my lord, I do meantime that dignity remember, Which doth beseem the daughter of a king! King. Fie! clear thy cloudy brow! it is my will Thou honour graciously his modest worth. [Elb. bows, but smiles disdainfully. By a well feigned flight, he was the first Who broke the stubborn foe, op'ning the road To victory. Here, with some public mark Of royal favour, by the hand receiv'd, I will to honour him; for, since the battle, A gloomy melancholy o'er him broods, E'en far exceeding what a father's death Should cast upon a youthful victor's triumph. Ah! here he comes! look on that joyless face! Elb. (aside to Dwina, looking scornfully to Edward as he approaches). Look with what slow and piteous gait he comes! Like younger brother of a petty Thane, Timing his footsteps to his father's dirge. Dwina. (aside). Nay, to my fancy it is wond'rous graceful. Elb. (contemptuously). A youth, indeed, who might with humble grace Beneath thy window tell his piteous tale. Enter Edward followed by Ethwald and attend-ants. King. Approach, my son: so will I call thee now. Here is a face whose smiles should gild thy honours If thou art yet awake to beauty's power. Edw. (kissing Elburga 's hand respectfully). Honour'd I am indeed; most dearly honour'd; I feel it here (his hand on his heart), and should be joyful too, If aught could gild my gloom. [Sighs very deeply, then suddenly recollecting himself. Elburga, thou wert ever fond of glory, And ever quick to honour valiant worth; Ethwald, my friendâhast thou forgotten Ethwald? [Presenting Ethw. to her. Elb. Could I forget the warlike Thane of Mairnieth, I must have barr'd mine ears against all sound; For every voice is powerful in his praise, And every Mercian tongue repeats his name. [Smiling graciously upon Ethw. King (impatiently). Where go we now? we wander from our purpose. Edward, thy youthful ardour season'd well With warlike craft, has crown'd my age with glory; Here be thy valour crown'd, it is my will, With honour's wreath, from a fair hand receiv'd. [Giving the wreath to Elburga. Edw. (earnestly). I do beseech you, uncle!âpray receive My grateful thanks! the mournful cypress best Becomes my brow; this honour must not be. King. Nay, lay aside unseemly diffidence; It must be so. Edw. (impressively). My heart is much depress'd: O do not add The burden of an undeserved honour, To bend me to the earth! King. These warlike chieftains say it is deserv'd, And nobly earn'd. It is with their concurrence That now I offer thee this warrior's wreath; Yes, ethling, and command thee to receive it. (Holding up his hand.) There, let the trumpet sound. [Trumpets sound. Edw. (holding up his hands distractedly). Peace, peace! nor put me to this agony! [Trumpets cease. And am I then push'd to this very point? Well, then, away deceit! too long hast thou Like the incumbent monster of a dream On the stretch'd sleeper's breast, depress'd my soul; I shake thee off, foul mate! O, royal sire, And you, ye valiant Mercians, hear the truth! Ye have believ'd, that by a feigned flight, I gain'd the first advantage o'er the foe, And broke their battle's strength; O would I had! That flight, alas! was real; the sudden impulse Of a weak mind, unprov'd and strongly struck With new and horrid things, until that hour Unknown and unimagin'd.â Nor was it honour's voice that call'd me back; The call of nature saved me. Noble Seagurth, Had I been son of any sire but thee, I had in dark and endless shame been lost, Nor e'er again before these valiant men Stood in this royal presence. In all my fortune, I am blest alone That my brave father, rescued by these arms, Look'd on me, smiling through the shades of death, And knew his son. He was a noble man! He never turn'd from dangerâbut his sonâ (Many voices at once.) His son is worthy of him! (Repeated again with more voices.) His son is worthy of him! Ethelbert (with enthusiasm). His son is worthy Of the noblest sire that ever wielded sword! Voices. Crown him, fair princess! Crown the noble Edward! [Elburga offers him the wreath, which he puts aside vehemently. Edw. Forbear! a band of scorpions round my brow Would not torment me like this laurel wreath. [Elb. turns from him contemptuously, and gives the wreath to the King. Edw. (to King). What, good my lord! is there not present here A Mercian brow deserving of that wreath? Shall he, who did with an uncover'd head Your battle fight, still wear his brows unbound? Do us not this disgrace! King (fretfully). Thou dost forget the royal dignity: Take it away. Giving it to an officer.) [A confused murmuring amongst the soldiers. (Aside to the seneschal, alarmed.) What noise is that? Sen. (aside to King). Your troops, my sire, are much dissatisfied, For that their favourite chief by you is deem'd Unworthy of the wreath. King (aside). What, is it so? call back mine officer. (Taking the wreath again, and giving it to Elb.) This wreath was meant for one of royal line, But every noble Mercian, great in arms, Is equal to a prince. Crown the most valiant Ethwald. Elb. (crowning Ethw. with great assumed majesty). Long may thy laurels flourish on thy brow, Most noble chief! [Ethw. takes the wreath and presses it to his lips, bowing to Elb., then to the King. Ethw. They who beneath the royal banner fight, Unto the fortunes of their royal chief Their success owe. Honour'd, indeed, am I That the brave ethling hath so favour'd me, And that I may, most humbly at your feet, My royal sire, this martial garland lay. [He, kneeling, lays the wreath at the King's feet; the King raises him up and embraces him; the soldiers clash their arms and call out. Sold. Long live the king! and long live noble Ethwald! [This is several times repeated. Exeunt King, Edward, Elburga, &amp;c. &amp;c.; Elburga looking graciously to Ethwald as she goes off. Manent Ethwald and Ethelbert. Eth. (repeating indignantly as they go off). Long live the king, and long live noble Ethwald! Fie on the stupid clowns, that did not join The gen'rous Edward's name! (To Ethw., who is standing looking earnestly after the princess.) What dost thou gaze on? Ethw. The princess look'd behind her as she went. Eth. And what is that to thee? [Walks silently across the stage once or twice gloomy and dissatisfied, then turning short upon Ethw. When wert thou last to see the lovely Bertha? Ethw. (hesitating). I cannot reckon it unto the dayâ Some moons ago. Eth. Some moons! the moon in her wide course shines not Upon a maid more lovely. Ethw. I know it well. Eth. Thou dost. Ethw. (after a pause, looking attentively to Eth., who stands muttering to himself). Methinks thou holdest converse with thyself. Eth. (speaking aloud, as if he continued to talk to himself). She steps upon the flowery bosom'd earth, As though it were a foot-cloth fitly placed Beneath the tread of her majestic step; And looks upon the human countenance, Whereon her Maker hath the signs impress'd Of all that He within the soul hath stored Of great and noble, gen'rous and benign, As on a molten plate, made to reflect Her grandeur and perfections. Ethw. Of whom speakst thou? Eth. Not of the gentle Bertha. [Exit. Ethw. What may he mean? He mark'd, with much displeasure, The soldiers shout my name, and now my favour With Mercia's princess frets him. What of this? Ha! hath his active mind outrun mine own In shaping future consequences? Yes, It must be so, a curtain is withdrawn, And to mine eye a goodly prospect shown, ExtendingâNo, I must not look upon it. [Exit hastily. SCENE IV. An open space, with arms, garments, and other spoils of the Britons heaped up on every side of the stage. Enter Soldiers, and range themselves in order; then enter Ethelbert and a Soldier, talking as they enter. Eth. Ethwald among his soldiers, dost thou say, Divides his spoil? Sol. He does, most bountifully; Nor to himself more than a soldier's share Retains, he is so gen'rous and so noble. Eth. I thank thee, friend. [Soldier retires. (After a pause.) I like not this: behind those heaps I'll stand, And mark the manner of this distribution. [Retires. Enter Alwy and a petty Thane. Alwy. Brave warriors! ye are come at his desire, Who for each humble soldier, bold in arms, That has beneath his orders fought, still bears A brother's heart. You see these goodly spoils: He gives them not unto the cloister'd priests: His soldiers pray for him. [Soldiers shout. Thane (to Alwy). What is thy meaning? Alwy. Knowest thou not the king has now bestow'd The chiefest portion of his British spoil On Alban's abbey? Enter Ethwald. (Soldiers shouting very loud.) Long live brave Ethwald! health to noble Ethwald! Ethw. Thanks for these kindly greetings, valiant hearts! [Soldiers shout again very loud. In truth I stand before you, brave companions, Somewhat asham'd; for with my wishes match'd, These hands are poor and empty. [Loud acclamations. I thank you all again; for well I see You have respect unto the dear good will That must enrich these heaps of homely stuff. Soldiers. Long live our gen'rous leader! Ethw. (giving a soldier a helmet filled with lots). Here, take the lots and deal them fairly round. Heaven send to all of you, my valiant friends, A portion to your liking. This rough heap [Pointing to the arms. Will give at least to each some warlike trophy, Which henceforth, hung upon his humble walls, Shall tell his sons and grandsons yet to come In what proud fields, and with what gallant mates Their father fought. And I, methinks, well pleas'd, Resting, as heretofore I oft have done, My wand'ring steps beneath your friendly roofs, Shall, looking up, the friendly token spy, And in my host a fellow soldier hail. Soldiers (with loud acclamations). God bless you, noble chief! unto the death We'll hold to you, brave leader! Ethw. And if to you I hold not, valiant Mercians, No noble chief am I. This motley gear, [Pointing to the spoils. Would it were all composed of precious things, That to his gentle wife or favour'd maid, Each soldier might have borne some goodly gift! But tell them, British matrons cross the woof With coarser hands than theirs. 1st sol. Saint Alban bless his noble countenance! 'Twas fashion'd for bestowing. 2d sol. Heav'n store his halls with wealth! Ethw. (going familiarly amongst the soldiers as the lots are drawing). Well, Ogar, hast thou drawn? good luck to thee. And thou, good Baldwin, too? Yet fie upon it! The heaviest weapon of the British host Lacks weight of metal for thy sinewy arm.â Ha! health to thee, mine old and honest host! I'm glad to see thee with thine arm unbound. And ruddy too! thy dame should give me thanks: I send thee home to her a younger man Than I receiv'd thee. (To the soldier with the lots who is passing him.) Nay, stay thee, friend, I pray, nor pass me o'er, We all must share alike: hold out thy cap. [Smiling as he draws. The knave would leave me out. [Loud acclamations, the soldiers surrounding him and clashing their arms. Enter Selred and Followers. Sel. (to sol.) Ha! whence comes all this uproar? Sol. Know you not? Your noble brother 'midst his soldiers shares His British spoils. Sel. The grateful knaves! is all their joy for this? [To his followers. Well, go and add to it my portion also; 'Twill make them roar the louder. Do it quickly. [Exit. Soldiers (looking after Sel.). Heaven bless him too, plain, honest, careless soul! He gives as though he gave not. [Loud acclamations. Long live brave Ethwald, and the noble Selred! Ethw. (aside to Alwy, displeased). How came he here? Alwy. I cannot tell. Ethw. (to sol.) We are confined within this narrow space: Go range yourselves at large on yon green sward, And there we'll spread the lots. [Exeunt; the soldiers arranging themselves as they go. SCENE V. An apartment in a royal castle. Enter Ethelbert, and leans his back upon a pillar near the front of the stage, as if deeply engaged in gloomy thoughts: afterwards enters Ethwald by the opposite side, at the bottom of the stage, and approaches Eth. slowly, observing him attentively as he advances. Ethw. Thou art disturbed, Ethelbert. Eth. I am. Ethw. Thine eyes roll strangely, as though thou beheldst Some dreadful thing:â On what lookst thou? Eth. Upon my country's ruin. The land is full of blood: her savage birds O'er human carcases do scream and batten: The silent hamlet smokes not; in the field The aged grandsire turns the joyless soil: Dark spirits are abroad, and gentle worth Within the narrow house of death is laid, An early tenant. Ethw. Thou'rt beside thyself! Thinkst thou that I, with these good arms, will stand And suffer all this wreck? Eth. Ha! sayst thou so? Alas, it is thyself Who rul'st the tempest! [Shaking his head solemnly. Ethw. If that I bear the spirit of a man, Thou falsely seest! Thinkst thou I am a beast; A fanged wolf, reft of all kindly sense, That I should do such deeds? I am a man aspiring to be great, But loathing cruelty: who wears a sword That will protect and not destroy the feeble. [Putting his hand vehemently upon his sword. Eth. Ha! art thou roused? blessings on thy wrath! I'll trust thee still. But see, the ethling comes, And on his face he wears a smile of joy. Enter Edward, advancing gaily to Ethwald. Edw. A boon, a boon, great Mairnieth's Thane, I crave. Eth. You come not with a suppliant's face, my lord. Edw. Not much cast down for lack of confidence My suit to gain. That envious braggart there, The chief of Bournoth, says, no Mercian arm, Of man now living, can his grandsire's sword In warlike combat wield: and, in good sooth! I forfeit forty of my fattest kine If Ethwald's arm does not the feat achieve. (To Ethw.) What sayst thou, friend? Methinks thou'rt grave and silent: Hast thou so soon thy noble trade forgot? Have at it then! I'll rouse thy spirit up: I'll soldier thee again. [Drawing his sword playfully upon Ethwald, who defends himself in like manner. Fie on't! that was a wicked northern push: It tells of thine old sports in Mollo's walls. [Pauses and fights again. To it again! How listless thou art grown! Where is thy manhood gone? Ethw. Fear not, my lord, enough remains behind To win your forty kine. Edw. I'll take thy word for't now: in faith, I'm tired! I've been too eager in the morning's chace To fight your noonday battles. [Putting the point of his sword to the ground, and leaning familiarly upon Ethwald. My arm, I fear, would make but little gain With Bournoth's sword. By arms and brave men's love! I could not brook to see that wordy braggart Perching his paltry sire above thy pitch; It rais'd my fiend within. When I am great, I'll build a tower upon the very spot Where thou didst first the British army stay, And shame the grandsires of those mighty Thanes Six ages deep. Lean I too hard upon thee? Ethw. No, nothing hard: most pleasant and most kindly. Take your full rest, my lord. Edw. In truth, I do: methinks it does me good To rest upon thy brave and valiant breast. Eth. (stepping before them with great animation). Well said, most noble Edward! The bosom of the brave is that on which Rests many a head: but most of all, I trow, Th' exposed head of princely youth thereon Rests gracefully. [Steps back some paces, and looks at them with delight. Edw. You look upon us, Thane, with eager eyes And looks of meaning. Eth. Pardon me, I pray! My fancy oftentimes will wildly play, And strong conceits possess me. Indulge my passing freak: I am a man Upon whose grizzled head the work of time Hath been by care perform'd, and, with the young, Claiming the priv'lege of a man in years. [Taking the hands of Edw. and Ethw. and joining them together. This is a lovely sight! indulge my fancy: And on this sword, it is a brave man's sword, Swear that you will unto each other prove, As prince and subject, true. Edw. No, no, good Thane! As friends, true friends! that doth the whole include. I kiss the honour'd blade. (Kissing the sword held out by Eth.) Eth. (presenting the sword to Ethw.) And what says noble Ethwald? Ethw. All that the brave should say. (Kissing it also.) Eth. (triumphantly). Now, Mercia, thou art strong! give me your hands; Faith, I must lay them both upon my breast! [Pressing both their hands to his breast. This is a lovely sight! Ethw. (softened). You weep, good Ethelbert. Eth. (brushing off his tears with his hand). Yes, yes! such tears as doth the warm shower'd earth Show to the kindly sun. Edw. (to Eth., gently clapping his shoulder). I love this well: thou like a woman weepest, And fightest like a man. But look, I pray! There comes my arms-man with the braggart's sword: Let us essay it yonder. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. An apartment in a royal castle. Ethwald is discovered sitting in deep meditation by the side of a couch, with a lamp burning by him on a high stand: the rest of the stage entirely dark. Ethw. Why am I haunted with these thoughts? What boots it That from their weak and priest-beridden king The soldiers turn distasteful, and on me In mutter'd wishes call? What boots all this? Occasion fairly smiles, but I am shackled; Elsewhere I needs must turn my climbing thoughts, But where? The youthful see around them spread A boundless field of undetermin'd things, Towering in tempting greatness: But, to the closer scan of men matured, These fade away, and in the actual state Of times and circumstances each perceives A path which doth to his advancement lead, And only one; as to the dazzled eye Of the night rev'ller, o'er his emptied bowl, The multiplied and many whirling lights Do shrink at last into one single torch, Shedding a steady ray. I see my path: But what is that to me? my steps are chain'd. Amongst the mighty great, the earth's high lords, There is no place for me! I must lie down In the dark tomb with those, whose passing brightness Shines for a while, but leaves no ray behind. [Throws himself half upon the couch and groans heavily. Enter Boy. Boy. My lord, my lord! (Ethw. lifts up his head, and looks sternly at him.) Are you unwell, my lord? Ethw. What dost thou want? Boy. I could not sleep: and as I list'ning lay To the drear wind that whistles through these towers, Methought I heard you groan like one in pain. Ethw. Away, and go to sleep: I want thee not: I say, begone (sternly). [Exit boy. [He pauses awhile, then sighs very deeply. He hangs upon me like a dead man's grasp On the wreck'd swimmer's neckâhis boyish love Was not my seeking; it was fasten'd on me, And now it hath become an iron band To fetter down my powers. O that I were Amidst the warlike and ungentle cast To strive uncumber'd! What have I to do With soft affection? (Softened.) Yet it needs must be! His gen'rous love:âhis brave ungrudging love: His manly gentle loveâO that he had Mine equal friend been born, who in my rise Had fair advancement found, and by my side The next in honour stood! He drags me to the earth! I needs must lay My head i' the dust.âDull hopeless privacy! From it my soul recoils: unto my nature It is the death of death, horrid and hateful. (Starting up eagerly.) No, in the tossed bark, Commander of a rude tumultuous crew, On the wild ocean would I rather live; Or in the mined caverns of the earth Untamed bands of lawless men control, By crime and dire necessity enleagued: Yea, in the dread turmoil of midnight storms, If such there be, lead on the sable hosts Of restless sprites, than say to mortal man âThou art my master.â Enter Boy. What, here again? Boy. O pardon me, my lord! I am in fear; Strange sounds do howl and hurtle round my bed; I cannot rest. Ethw. Begone, thou wakeful pest! I say, be-gone! [Exit boy. [Ethw. walks several times across the stage and then pauses. Yet in my mind one ever-present thought Rises omnipotent o'er all the rest, And says, âThou shalt be great.â What may this mean? before me is no way. What deep endued seer will draw this veil Of dark futurity? Of such I've heard, But when the troubled seek for them, they are not. Re-enter Boy. (Stamping with his foot.) What! here a third time? Boy (falling at his feet). O, my noble master! If you should slay me I must come to you; For in my chamber fearful things there be, That sound i' the dark; O, do not chide me back. Ethw. Strange sound within thy chamber, foolish wight! Boy (starting). Good mercy, list! Ethw. It is some night-bird screaming on the tower. Boy. Ay, so belike it seemeth, but I knowâ Ethw. What dost thou know? Boy. It is no bird, my lord. Ethw. What wouldst thou say? Boy (clasping his hands together, and staring earnestly in Ethw.'s face). At dead of night, from the dark Druid's cave Up rise unhallow'd sprites, and o'er the earth Hold for the term their wicked rule. Aloft, Some mounted on the heavy sailing cloud, Oft pour down noisome streams or biting hail On the benighted hind, and from his home, With wayward eddying blasts, still beat him back. Some on the waters shriek like drowning men, And, when the pitying passenger springs forth, To lend his aid, the dark flood swallows him. Some on lone marshes shine like moving lights; And some on towers and castle turrets perch'd, Do scream like nightly birds, to scare the good, Or rouse the murd'rer to his bloody work. Ethw. The Druid's cave, sayst thou? What cave is that? Where is it? Who hath seen it? What scar'd fool Hath fill'd thine ears with all these horrid things? Boy. It is a cavern vast and terrible, Under the ground full deep; perhaps, my lord, Beneath our very feet, here as we stand; For few do know the spot and centre of it, Though many mouths it has and entries dark. Some are like hollow pits bor'd through the earth, O'er which the list'ning herdsman bends his ear, And hears afar their lakes of molten fire Swelt'ring and boiling like a mighty pot. Some like strait passes through the rifted rocks, From which oft issue shrieks, and whistling gusts, And wailings dismal. Nay, some, as they say, Deep hollow'd underneath the river's bed, Which show their narrow op'nings through the fern And tangling briars, like dank and noisome holes Wherein foul adders breed. But not far hence The chiefest mouth of all, 'midst beetling rocks And groves of blasted oaks, gapes terrible. Ethw. So near? but who are they who dwell within? Boy. The female high Arch Druid therein holds It is natural to suppose that the diviners or fortune-tellers of this period should, in their superstitions and pretensions, very much resemble the ancient Druidesses who were so much revered amongst the Britons as oracles and prophetesses, and that they should, amongst the vulgar, still retain the name of their great predecessors. In Henry's History of Britain, vol. i. p. 181., it will be found that the superstitious practices of the Druids continued long after their religion was abolished, and resisted for a long time the light of Christianity; and that even so late as the reign of Canute, it was necessary to make laws against it. With many Druids tending on her will, (Old, as they say, some hundred years or more) Her court, where horrid spells bind to her rule Spirits of earth and air. Ethw. Ay, so they tell thee, But who is he that has held converse with her? Boy. Crannock, the bloody prince, did visit her, And she did show to him the bloody end Whereto he soon should come; for all she knows That is, or has been, or shall come to pass. Ethw. Yes, in times past such intercourse might be, But who has seen them now? Boy. Thane Ethelbert. Ethw. (starting). What saidst thou, Ethelbert? Boy. Yes, truly; oft he goes to visit them What time the moon rides in her middle course. Ethw. Art thou assured of this? Boy. A youth who saw him issue from the cave; 'Twas he who told it me. Ethw. Mysterious man! (After a pause.) Where sleeps the Thane? Boy. If walls and doors may hold him, He sleeps not distant, in the southern tower. Ethw. Take thou that lamp, and go before me then. Boy. Where? Ethw. To the southern tower. Art thou afraid? Boy. No, my good lord, but keep you close behind. [Exeunt; Boy bearing the lamp, and looking often behind to see that Ethw. is near him. SCENE II. A small gallery or passage with a door in front, which is opened, and enter Ethwald, and Ethelbert with a lamp in his hand. Eth. Then, by the morrow's midnight moon, we meet At the Arch Sister's cave: till then, farewell! Ethw. Farewell! I will be punctual. [Exit. Eth. (looking after him for some time before he speaks). It ever is the mark'd propensity Of restless and aspiring minds to look Into the stretch of dark futurity. But be it so: it now may turn to good. [Exit, returning back again into the same chamber from which he came. SCENE III. A wide arched cave, rude but grand, seen by a sombre light, a small furnace burning near the front of the stage. Enter Ethwald and Ethelbert, who pause and look round for some time without speaking. Ethw. Gloomy, and void, and silent! Eth. Hush! Ethw. What hearest thou? Eth. Their hollow sounding steps. Lo! seest thou not? [Pointing to the further end of the stage, where, from an obscure recess, enter three Mystics robed in white, and ranged on one side of the stage, point to Ethwald: whilst from another obscure recess enter three Mystic Sisters, and ranged on the opposite side point to Ethwald: then from a mid recess enters the Arch Sister robed also in white, but more majestic than the others, and a train of Mystics and Mystic Sisters behind her. She advances half-way up the stage, then stops short, and points also to Ethwald. (All the Mystics, &amp;c. speaking at once.) Who art thou? Arch Sist. I know thee who thou art; the hand of Mercia. The hand that lifts itself above the head. I know thee who thou art. Ethw. Then haply ye do know my errand too. Arch Sist. I do; but turn thee back upon thy steps, And tempt thy fate no farther. Ethw. From the chaf'd shore turn back the swelling tide! I came to know my fate, and I will know it. 1st Mystic. Must we call up from the deep centre's womb The spirits of the night and their dread lord? 1st Myst. S. Must we do that which makes the entombed dead From coffins start? Ethw. Raise the whole host of darkness an ye will, But I must be obey'd. [The Arch Sister shrieks, and, throwing her mantle over her face, turns to go away. Ethw. If there be power in mortal arm to hold you, Ye stir not hence until I am obey'd. 1st Myst. And how compellest thou? Ethw. With this good sword. 1st Myst. Swords here are children's wands of no avail: There, warrior, is thy weapon. Ethw. Where, Mystic? say. 1st Myst. (pointing to the furnace). Behold within that fire A bar of burning iron! pluck it forth. Ethw. (resolutely). I will. [Goes to the furnace, and putting in his hand, pulls out what seems a red hot bar of iron. Arch Sist. (throwing off her mantle). Thou hast subdued me; thou shalt be obey'd. Ethw. (casting away the bar). Away, thou paltry terror! Arch Sist. (to Ethw.) We now begin our rites: be firm, be silent. [She stretches forth her hand with a commanding air, and the Mystics and Mystic Sisters begin their incantations at the bottom of the stage, moving round in several mazy circles one within another. Fire is at last seen flashing from the midst of the inner circle, and immediately they all begin a hollow muttering sound, which becomes louder and louder, till at length it is accompanied with dismal sounds from without, and distant music, solemn and wild. Ethw. (grasping Ethelbert 's hand). What dismal sounds are these? 'Tis like a wild responsive harmony, Tun'd to the answ'ring yells of damned souls. What follows this? Some horrid thing! Thou smilest: Nay, press thy hand, I pray thee, on my breast; There wilt thou find no fear, Eth. Hush! hear that distant noise. Ethw. 'Tis thunder in the bowels of the earth, Heard from afar. [A subterraneous noise like thunder is heard at a distance, becoming louder as it approaches. Upon hearing this, the Mystics suddenly leave off their rites; the music ceases, and they, opening their circles, range themselves on either side of the stage, leaving the Arch Sister alone in the middle. Arch Sist. (holding up her hand). Mystics, and Mystic Maids, and leagued bands! The master spirit comes: prepare. (All repeat after her). Prepare. 1st Mystic. Hark! through the darken'd realms below, Through the fiery regions glow: Through the massy mountain's core, Through the mines of living ore; Through the yawning caverns wide, Through the solid and the void; Through the dank and through the dry, Through th' unseen of mortal eye: Upon the earthquake's secret course, afar I hear the sounding of thy car: Sulphureous vapours load the rising gale; We know thy coming; mighty master, hail! (They all repeat.) Mighty master, hail! [The stage darkens by degrees, and a thick vapour begins to ascend at the bottom of the stage. 2d Mystic. Hark, hark! what murmurs fill the dome! Who are they who with thee come? Those who, in their upward flight, Rouse the tempests of the night: Those who ride in flood and fire; Those who rock the tumbling spire: Those who, on the bloody plain, Shriek with the voices of the slain: Those who through the darkness glare, And the sleepless murd'rer scare; Those who take their surly rest On the troubled dreamer's breast: Those who make their nightly den In the guilty haunts of men: Through the heavy air I hear Their hollow trooping onward bear: The torch's shrinking flame is dim and pale: I know thy coming; mighty master, hail! (All repeat again). Mighty master, hail! [The stage becomes still darker, and a thicker vapour ascends. 3d Mystic. Lo! the mystic volumes rise! Wherein are lapt from mortal eyes Horrid deeds as yet unthought, Bloody battles yet unfought: The sudden fall and deadly wound Of the tyrant yet uncrown'd; And his line of many dyes Who yet within the cradle lies. Moving forms, whose stilly bed Long hath been among the dead; Moving forms, whose living morn Breaks with the nations yet unborn, In mystic vision walk the horrid pale: We own thy presence; mighty master, hail! (All). Mighty master, hail! Enter from the farther end of the stage crowds of terrible spectres, dimly seen through the vapour, which now spreads itself over the whole stage. All the Mystics and Mystic Sisters bow themselves very low, and the Arch Sister, standing alone in the middle, bows to all the different sides of the cave. Ethw. (to 1st Mystic). To every side the mystic mistress bows, What meaneth this? mine eye no form perceives: Where is your mighty chief? 1st Mystic. Above, around you, and beneath. Ethw. Has he no form to vision sensible? 1st Mystic. In the night's noon, in the winter's noon, in the lustre's noon: Of times twice ten within the century's round Is he before our leagued bands confess'd In dread appearance: But in what form or in what circumstance May not be told; he dies who utters it. [Ethw. shrinks at this, and seems somewhat appalled. The Arch Sister, after tossing about her arms, and writhing her body in a violent agitation, fixes her eyes, like one waked from a dream, steadfastly upon Ethw.; then going suddenly up to him, grasps him by the hand with energy. Arch Sist. Thou who wouldst pierce the deep and awful shade Of dark futurity, to know the state Of after greatness waiting on thy will, For in thy power acceptance or rejection Is freely put, lift up thine eyes and say, What seest thou yonder? [Pointing to a dark arched opening in the roof of the cave, where an illuminated crown and sceptre appear. Ethw. (starting). Ha! e'en the inward vision of my soul In actual form pourtray'd! [His eyes brightening wonderfully. Sayst thou it shall be mine? Arch Sist. As thou shalt choose. Ethw. I ask of thee no more. [Stands gazing upon the appearance till it fades away. So soon extinguish'd? Hath this too a meaning? It says, perhaps, my greatness shall be short. Arch Sist. I speak to thee no further than I may, Therefore be satisfied. Ethw. And I am satisfied. Dread mystic maid, Receive my thanks. Arch Sist. Nay, Ethwald, our commission ends not here, Stay and behold what follows. [The stage becomes suddenly dark, and most terrible shrieks, and groans, and dismal lamentations, are heard from the farther end of the cave. Ethw. What horrid sounds are these? Arch Sist. The varied voice of woe, of Mercia's woe: Of those who shall, beneath thine iron hand, The cup of mis'ry drink. There, dost thou hear The dungeon'd captives' sighs, the shrilly shrieks Of childless mothers and distracted maids, Mix'd with the heavy groans of dying men! The widow's wailings, too, and infant's criesâ [Ethw. stops his ears in horror. Ay, stop thine ears; it is a horrid sound. Ethw. Forefend that e'er again I hear the like! What didst thou say? O, thou didst foully say! Do I not know my nature? heav'n and earth As soon shall changeâ (A voice above.) Swear not! (A voice beneath.) Swear not! (A voice on the same level, but distant.) Swear not! Arch Sist. Now, once again, and our commission ends. Look yonder, and behold that shadowy form. [Pointing to an arched recess, across which bursts a strong light, and discovers a crowned phantom, covered with wounds, and representing by its gestures one in agony. Ethw. looks and shrinks back. What dost thou see? Ethw. A miserable man: his breast is pierced With many wounds, and yet his gestures seem The agony of a distracted mind, More than of pain. Arch. Sist. But wears he not a crown? Ethw. Why does it look so fix'dly on me thus? What are its woes to me? Arch Sist. They are thy own. Knowst thou no traces of that alter'd form, Nor seest that crowned phantom is thyself? Ethw. (shudders, then after a pause). I may be doom'd to meet a tyrant's end, But not to be a tyrant. Did all the powers of hell attest the doom, I would belie it. Know I not my nature? By every dreaded power and hallow'd thingâ (Voice over the stage.) Swear not! (Voice under the stage.) Swear not! (Distant voice off the stage.) Swear not! [Thundering noise is heard under ground. The stage becomes instantly quite dark, and Mystics and Spirits, &amp;c. disappear, Ethw. and Eth. remaining alone. Eth. (after a pause). How art thou? Ethw. Is it thy voice? O, let me feel thy grasp! Mine ears ring strangely, and my head doth feel As though I were bereaved of my wits. Are they all gone? Where is thy hand, I pray? We've had a fearful bout! Eth. Thy touch is cold as death: let us ascend And breathe the upper air. I will not take upon me to say that, if I had never read Shakspeare's Macbeth, I should have thought of bringing Ethwald into a cavern under ground to inquire his destiny, though I believe this desire to look into futurity (particularly in a superstitious age) is a very constant attendant on ambition; but I hope the reader will not find in the above scene any offensive use made of the works of that great master. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A forest. Enter Ethwald with a bow in his hand, and a Boy carrying his arrows. Ethw. (looking off the stage). Ha! Alwy, soon return'd! and with him comes My faithful Ongar. Enter Alwy and Ongar with bows also, as if in quest of sport, by the opposite side. Thou comest, Alwy, with a busy face. (To boy.) Go, Boy; I shot mine arrow o'er those elms, Thou'lt find it far beyond. [Exit boy. Now, friend, what tidings? Alwy. Within the tufted centre of the wood The friendly chiefs are met, thus, like ourselves As careless ramblers guised, all to a man Fix'd in your cause. Their followers too are firm; For, much disgusted with the monkish face Their feeble monarch wears, a warlike leader, Far, far inferior to the noble Ethwald, May move them as he lists. Ethw. That time and circumstances on me call Imperiously, I am well assured. Good Ongar, what sayst thou? how thrives thy part Of this important task! Ong. Well as your heart could wish. At the next council, Held in the royal chamber, my good kinsman Commands the guard, and will not bar our way. Ethw. May I depend on this? Ong. You may, my lord. Ethw. Thanks to thee, Ongar! this is noble service, And shall be nobly thank'd. There is, good Alwy, Another point; hast thou unto the chiefs Yet touch'd upon it? Alwy. Yes, and they all agree 'tis most expedient That with Elburga's hand, since weaker minds Are blindly wedded to the royal line, Your right be strengthen'd. Ethw. And this they deem expedient? Alwy. You sigh, my lord; she is, indeed, less gentleâ Ethw. Regard it not, it is a passing thought, And it will have its sigh, and pass away. [Turning away for a little space, and then coming forward again. What means hast thou devised, that for a term Selred and Ethelbert may be remov'd? For faithful to the royal line they are, And will not swerve: their presence here were dang'rous: We must employ them in some distant strife. Alwy. I have devis'd a plan, but for the means Brave Ongar here stands pledged. Woggarwolfe, Who once before unweetingly has served us, Will do the same again. Ethw. How so? 'tis said that since his last affray, With the keen torment of his wounds subdu'd, On sick bed laid, by the transforming power Of artful monks, he has become most saintly. Alwy. Well, but we trust his saintship ne'ertheless May still be lur'd to do a sinner's work. To burn the castle of a hateful heretic Will make amends for all his bloody deeds: You catch the plan: nay, Hexulf and his priests Will be our helpmates here. Smile not; good Ongar Has pledged his word for this. Ethw. And I will trust to it. This will, indeed, Draw off the Thanes in haste. But who is near? Skulking behind yon thicket stands a man: Seest thou? [Pointing off the stage. Alwy. Go to him, Ongar, scan him well, And if his face betrays a list'ner's guiltâ Thou hast thy dagger there? Ong. Yes, trust me well. Ethw. Nay, Ongar, be not rash in shedding blood! Let not one drop be spilt that may be spar'd. Secure him if he wear a list'ner's face: We are too strong for stern and ruthless caution. [Exit Ongar. I'm glad he is withdrawn a little space, Ere we proceed to join the leagued chiefs. Hast thou agreed with Cuthbert? Is he sure? Alwy. Sure. 'Tis agreed when next the ethling hunts, To lead him in the feigned quest of game From his attendants; there, in ambush laid, Cuthbert and his adherents seize upon him, And will conduct him with the ev'ning's close To Arrick's rugged tower. All is prepar'd. Ethw. But hast thou charged him well that this be done With all becoming care and gentleness, That nothing may his noble nature gall More than the hard necessity compels? Alwy. Do not mistrust us so! your brow is dark: At Edward's name your changing countenance Is ever clouded. [Ethw. turns from him agitated. You are disturb'd, my lord. Ethw. I am disturb'd. (Turning round and grasping Alwy by the hand.) I'll tell thee, Alwyâyes, I am disturb'dâ No gleam of glory through my prospect breaks, But still his image, 'thwart the brightness cast, Shades it to night. Alwy. It will be always so: but wherefore should it? Glory is ever bought by those who earn it With loss of many lives most dear and precious. So is it destin'd. Let that be to him Which in the crowded breach or busy field All meet regardless from a foeman's hand. Do the still chamber, and the muflled tread, And th' unseen stroke that doth th' infliction deal, Alter its nature? Ethw. (pushing Alwy away from him vehemently, and putting up both his hands to his head). Forbear! forbear! I shut mine eyes, mine ears; All entrance bar that may into my mind Th' abhorred thing convey. Have I not said, Thou shalt not dare in word, in look, in gesture, In slightest indication of a thought, Hold with my mind such base communication? By my sword's strength! did I not surely think From this bold seizure of the sovereign pow'r, A pow'r for which I must full dearly pay, So says the destiny that o'er me hangs, To shield his weakness and restore again In room of Mercia's crown a nobler sway, Won by my sword, I would as liefâNorthumberland Invites my arms, and soon will be subdu'd; Of this full sure, a good amends may be To noble Edward made. Alwy (who during the last part of Ethwald 's speech has been smiling behind his back malignantly). O yes, full surely: And wand'ring harpers shall in hall and bower Sing of the marv'llous deed. Ethw. (turning short upon him, and perceiving his smile). Thou smil'st methinks. Full well I read the meaning of that look: 'Tis a fiend's smile, and it will prove a false one. [Turning away angrily, whilst Alwy walks to the bottom of the stage. (Aside, looking suspiciously after him.) Have I offended him? he is an agent Most needful to me. (Aloud, advancing to him.) Good Alwy, anxious minds will often chideâ (Aside, stopping short.) He hears me not, or is it but a feint? Alwy (looking off the stage). Your arrow-boy returns. Ethw. (aside, nodding to himself). No, 'tis a free and unoffended voice; I'm wrong. This is a bird whose fleshed beak The prey too strongly scents to fly away: I'll spare my courtesies. (Aloud.) What sayst thou, Alwy? Alwy (pointing). Your arrow-boy. Ethw. I'm glad he is return'd. Re-enter Boy. Boy. Nowhere, my lord, can I the arrow find. Ethw. Well, boy, it matters not; let us move on. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A narrow gallery in an abbey or cloister, with several doors opening into it. Enter Hexulf and Ongar and two monks. Hex. Fear not, brave Ongar, we, upon thy hint, Will quickly act; for here our eager wishes Are with the church's good most closely join'd. 1st monk. This is the time when he should walk abroad. (Listening.) I hear him at his door. Hex. Leave us, good Ongar. Ong. To your good skill I do commit it then; Having but only you, most rev'rend father, To take my part against this wizard Thane. 1st monk (still listening). Begone, he issues forth. [Exit Ongar. [One of the doors opens slowly, and enters Woggarwolfe, wrapped in a cloak, and his head bound. Hex. Good morrow, valiant Thane, whose pious gifts Have won heav'n's grace to renovate thy strength, And grant thee longer life, how goes thy health? Wog. I thank you, rev'rend father, greatly mended. 1st monk. The prayers of holy men have power to save, E'en on the very borders of the tomb, The humbled soul who doth with gifts enrich The holy church. 2d monk. Didst thou not feel within thee A peaceful calm, a cheering confidence, Soon as thy pious offering was accepted? Wog. (hesitating). Yes, rev'rend fathers,âI have thought indeedâ Perhaps you meant it soâthat since that time The devil has not scar'd me in my dreams So oft as he was wont, when sore with wounds I first was laid upon my bed of pain. Hex. Ay, that is much; but noble Woggarwolfe, Thinkest thou not the church doth merit well Some stable gift, some fix'd inheritance? Thou hast those lands that are so nearly join'd Unto Saint Alban's abbey. Wog. (much surprised). My lands! give up my lands? 1st monk. What are thy lands Compar'd to that which they will purchase for thee? 2d monk. To lay thy coffin'd body in the ground, Rob'd in the garb of holy men, and bless'd? 1st monk. To have thy tomb beneath the shading arch Of sacred roof, where nought profane may enter; While midnight spirits stand and yell without, But o'er the sacred threshold dare not trespass. Wog. (with a rueful countenance). What, do you think I shall be dead so soon? Hex. Life is uncertain; but how glorious, Thane, To look beyond this wicked world of strife, And for thyself a lofty seat provide With saints and holy men, and angel bands! Wog. Nay, father, I am not so highly bent; Do but secure me from the horrid fangs Of the terrific fiend: I am not proud, That will suffice me. Hex. Nay, herein thy humility we praise not, And much I fear, at such a humble pitch, He who so lately scar'd thee in thy dreams May reach thee still. 1st monk. O think of this! Hex. Dreadful it is, thou knowst, To see him in thy dreams; but when awake, Naked, and all uncloth'd of flesh and blood, As thou at last must be; how wilt thou bear To see him yelling o'er thee as his prey; Bearing aloft his dark and hideous form; Grinding his horrid jaws and darting on thee His eyes of vivid fire? [The monks sign themselves with great marks of fear, and Woggarwolfe looks terrified. Ah! thinkst thou, Thane, That many gifts, ay, half of all thou'rt worth, Would dearly purchase safety from such terrors? Wog. (in a quick perturbed voice). I have the plunder of two neighb'ring chiefs, Whom I surprised within their towers and slew; I'll give you allâif that suffices not, I'll fall upon a third, ay, though it were My next of kin, nor spare of all his goods One fragment for myself. O, holy fathers! I humbly crave saintly protection of you. Hex. Nay, Woggarwolfe, on shrines of holy saints No gift ere works with efficacious power By force and violence gain'd; unless, indeed, It be the spoil of some unsaintly Thane, Some faithless wizard or foul heretic. Thou hast a neighbour, impious Ethelbert; His towers to burn and consecrate his spoils, O'er all thy sins would cast a sacred robe, On which nor fiend nor devil durst fix a fang. But now thou lackest strength for such a work, And mayst be dead ere thou hast time to do it: Therefore I counsel thee, give up thy lands. Wog. O, no! I'm strong enough: my men are strong. Give us your rev'rend blessing o'er our heads, And we'll set out forthwith. Hex. Then nothing doubt that on your worthy zeal Will fall the blessing. Let us onward move. Where are thy followers? [Exeunt: Hex. talking busily to Wog., and the monks smiling to one another as they go out. SCENE VI. The royal apartment: the King is discovered with Hexulf, the seneschal, and several friends or councillors, seated round a council table. King (as if continuing to speak). It may be so: youth finds no obstacle, But I am old. Full many a storm on this grey head has beaten; And now, on my high station do I stand, Like the tired watchman in his air-rock'd tower, Who looketh for the hour of his release. I'm sick of worldly broils, and fain would rest With those who war no more. One gleam of light Did sweetly cheer the ev'ning of my day: Edward, my son! he was the kindliest prop That age did ever rest onâhe is gone, What should I fight for now? Sen. For thine own honour, for the weal of Mercia, With weapons in our hands, and strong in men, Who to the royal standard soon will flock, If summon'd by thy firm and gen'ral orders. Shall these men be our masters? Heaven forefend! Five thousand warriors might disperse the foe, Even with that devil Ethwald at their head; And shall we think of granting to those rebels Their insolent demands? King. Good seneschal, if that you think our strength Permits us still in open field to strive With hope of good, I am not yet so old But I can brace these stiffen'd limbs in iron, And do a soldier's service. (To 2d coun.) Thane of Mordath, Thy visage light'neth not upon these hopes; What are thy thoughts? 2d coun. E'en that these hopes will bring us to a state Reft of all hope. The rebel chiefs but seek their own enrichment, Not Ethwald's exaltation, good my lord; Bribe them, and treat for peace. Lack you the means? The church, for whose enriching you have rais'd This storm, can well supply it; and most surely Will do it cheerfully. [Turning to Hexulf. Hex. No, by the holy mass! that were to bring The curse of heav'n upon our impious heads. To spoil the holy church is sacrilege: And to advise such spoil in any wise Is sacrilegious and abominable. 1st coun. I am as faithful to the holy church As thou art, angry priest. I do defy theeâ Sen. What, have ye no respect unto the king? I do command you, peace. Who now intrudes? Enter a Servant in great terror. Serv. The rebel force! the castle is surprised! They are at handâthey have o'erpower'd the guard. 2d coun. Pray God thou liest! I think it cannot be. [They all rise up alarmed. Serv. It is as true as I do tread this spot. Enter a Soldier wounded. King (to sol.). Ha! what sayst thou? thou bearest for thy words A rueful witness. Sol. Take arms, and save the king, if it be possible. The rebel chieftains have the gate surprised, And gain'd, below, the entrance of this tower. They struggled for the pass; sharp was the broil; This speaks for me, that I have borne my part. [Falls down exhausted. Hex. (to King). Retire, my lord, into the higher chamber. Your arm can give but small assistance here. Until this horrid visit be o'erpast, You may conceal yourself. King. No, father, never shall the king of Mercia Be, from his hiding-place, like a mean man Pull'd forth. But, noble friends, it seems not wise That this necessity should reach to you. These rebels seek my life, and with that life They will be satisfied. In my defence, Thus taken as we are, all stand were useless; Therefore, if now you will obey your king, His last command, retire and save your lives For some more useful end. Finding me here, They will no farther search: retire, my friends. 2d coun. What, leave our king to face his foes alone! King. No, not alone; my friend, the seneschal, Will stay with me. We have been young together, And the same storms in our rough day of life Have beat upon us: be it now God's will, We will lay down our aged heads together In the still rest, and bid good night to strife. Have I said well, my friend? [Holding out his hand to the seneschal. Sen. (kissing his hand with great warmth, and putting one knee to the ground). O my lov'd master! many a bounteous favour Has shower'd upon me from your royal hand, But ne'er before was I so proudly honour'd. [Rising up with assumed grace. Retire, young men, for now I must be proud; Retire, your master will confront the foe As may become a king. (All calling out at once.) No, no! we will not leave him. [They all range themselves, drawing their swords, round the King, and the old seneschal stands, by pre-eminence, close to his master's side. 2d coun. Here is a wall through which they first must force A bloody way, ere on his royal head One silver hair be scath'd. Enter Ethwald, Alwy, and the Conspirators. Alwy. Now vengeance for injustice and oppression! 2d coun. On your own heads, then, be it, miscreant chiefs! [They fight round the King; his party defend him bravely, till many more conspirators enter, and it is overpowered. Ethw. (aside, angrily, to Alwy, on still seeing the King, standing in the midst, unhurt, and with great dignity, the seneschal by his side, and no one offering to attack him). Hast thou forgot? Where are thy chosen men? Is there no hand to do the needful work? This is but children's play. (To some of his party.) Come, let us search, that in the neighb'ring chamber No lurking foe escape. [Exit with some followers. Alwy (giving a sign to his followers, and going up insolently to the King). Oswal, resign thy sword. Sen. First take thou mine, thou base, ignoble traitor! [Giving Alwy a blow with his sword; upon which Alwy and his followers fall upon the King and the seneschal, and surrounding them on every side, kill them, with many wounds, the crowd gathering so close round them, that their fall cannot be seen. Re-enter Ethwald, and the crowd opening on each side shows the dead bodies of the King and the Seneschal. Ethw. (affecting surprise). What sight is this? Ah! ye have gone too far. Who did this deed? Alwy. My followers, much enraged at slight offence, Did fall upon him. Ethw. All have their end decreed, and this, alas! Has been his fated hour. Come, chiefs and valiant friends, why stand we here Looking on that which cannot be repair'd? All honour shall be paid unto the dead. And, were this deed of any single hand The willing crime, he should have vengeance too But let us now our task of night fulfil: Much have we still to do ere morning dawn. [Exeunt Ethw. and followers, and the scene closes. SCENE VII. A royal apartment: Enter Elburga, with her hair scattered upon her shoulders, and with the action of one in violent grief, followed by Dwina, who seems to be soothing her. Elb. Cease, cease! thy foolish kindness soothes me not; My morning is o'ercast; my glory sunk; Leave me alone to wring my hands and weep. Dwi. O no, my princely mistress! grieve not thus! Over our heads the blackest clouds do pass And brighter follow them. Elb. No, no, my sky is night! I was a princess, Almost a queen: in gorgeous pomp beheld, The public gaze was ever turn'd on me; Proud was the highest Thane or haughtiest dame To do my bidding, ev'ry count'nance watch'd Each changeful glance of my commanding eye, To read its meaning: now my state is chang'd: Scoffing and insult and degrading pity Abide the daughter of a murder'd king. Heaven's vengeance light upon them all! Begone! I hate the very light for looking on me! Begone! and soothe me not! Dwi. Forgive me, princess; do not thus despair; King Oswal's daughter many friends will find. Elb. Friends! hold thy peace!âOh it doth rend my heart! I have been wont to talk of subjects, vassals, Dependants, servants, slaves, but not of friends. Where shall I hide my head? Dwi. Surely, dear mistress, with Saint Cuthbert's nuns, Whose convent by your father's gifts is rich, You will protection find. There quiet rest, And holy converse of those pious maids, After a while will pour into your mind Soft consolation. [Putting her hands on Elburga 's soothingly. Elb. (pushing her away). Out upon thee, fool! Go, speak thy comforts To spirits tame and abject as thyself: They make me mad; they make me thus to tear My scatter'd locks and strew them to the winds. [Tearing her hair distractedly. Enter a Servant. (To ser.) What brings thee here? Ser. Ethwald, the king, is at the gate, and asks To be admitted to your presence, princess. Elb. (becoming suddenly calm). What, Ethwald, sayst thou? sayst thou truly so? Ser. Yes, truly, princess. Elb. Ethwald, that Thane whom thou dost call the king? Ser. Yes, he whom all the states and chiefs of Mercia Do call the king. Elb. He enters not. Tell him I am unwell, And will not be disturb'd. [Exit ser. What seeks he here? Fie, poorly fainting soul! Rouse! rouse thee up! To all the world beside Subdued and humbled would I rather be Than in the eyes of this proud man. Re-enter Servant. What sayst thou? Is he departed? Ser. No, he will not depart, but bids me say The entrance he has begg'd he now commands. I hear his steps behind me. Enter Ethwald. Elburga turns away from him proudly. Ethw. Elburga, turn and look upon a friend. Elb. (turning round haughtily, and looking on him with an assumed expression of anger and scornful contempt). Usurping rebel, who hast slain thy master; Take thou a look that well beseems thy worth, And hie thee hence, false traitor! Ethw. Yes, I will hie me hence, and with me lead A fair and beauteous subject to my will; That will which may not be gainsaid. For now High heaven, that hath decreed thy father's fall, Hath also me appointed king of Mercia, With right as fair as his: which I'll maintain And by the proudest in this lordly realm Will be obey'd, even by thy lofty self. Elb. Put shackles on my limbs and o'er my head Let your barr'd dungeons low'r; then mayst thou say, âWalk not abroad,â and so it needs must be: But thinkst thou to subdue, bold as thou art, The lofty spirit of king Oswal's daughter? Go, bind the wild winds in thy hollow shield, And bid them rage no more: they will obey thee. Ethw. Yes, proud Elburga, I will shackle thee. But on the throne of Mercia shalt thou sit, Not in the dungeon's gloom. Ay, and albeit the wild winds refuse To be subjected to my royal will, The lofty spirit of king Oswal's daughter I will subdue. (Taking her hand.) Elb. (throwing him off from her vehemently). Off with those bloody hands that slew my father! Thy touch is horrid to me! 'tis a fiend's grasp: Out from my presence! bloody Thane of Mairnieth! Ethw. Ay! frown on me, Elburga; proudly frown: I knew thy haughty spirit, and I lov'd it, Even when I saw thee first in gorgeous state; When, bearing high thy stately form, thou stoodst Like a proud queen, and on the gazing crowd, Somewhat offended with a late neglect, Darted thy looks of anger and disdain. High Thanes and dames shrank from thine eye, whilst I, Like one who from the mountain's summit sees, Beneath him far the harmless lightning play, With smiling admiration mark'd thee well, And own'd a kindred soul. Each angry flash Of thy dark eye was loveliness to me. But know, proud maid, my spirit outmasters thine, And heedeth not the anger nor the power Of living thing. Elb. Bold and amazing man! Ethw. And bold should be the man who weds Elburga. Elb. Away! it cannot be, it shall not be! My soul doth rise against thee, bloody chief, And bids thy power defiance. Ethw. Then art thou mine in truth, for never yet Did hostile thing confront me unsubdued; Defy me and thou'rt conquer'd. Elb. Thou most audacious chief! it shall not be. Ethw. It shall, it must be, maiden, I have sworn it; And here repeat it on that beauteous hand Which to no power but with my life I'll yield [Grasping her hand firmly, which she struggles to free. Frown not, Elburga! 'tis in vain to strive; My spirit outmasters thine. Elb. Sayst thou to me thou didst not slay my father? Sayst thou those hands are guiltless of his death? Ethw. Thinkst thou I'll plead, and say I have not slain A weak old man, whose inoffensive mind, And strong desire to quit the warring world For quiet religious rest, could be, in truth, No hindrance to my greatness? were this fitting In Mercia's king, and proud Elburga's lord? Elb. (turning away). Elburga's lord? Thou art presumptuous, prince: Go hence, and brave me not. Ethw. I will go hence forthwith; and, by my side, The fair selected partner of my throne I'll lead, where the assembled chiefs of Mercia Wait to receive from me their future queen. Elb. Distract me not! Ethw. Resistance is distraction. Who ever yet my fixed purpose cross'd? Did Ethwald ever yield? Come, queen of Mercia! This firm grasp shall conduct thee to a throne: [Taking her hand, which she feebly resists. Come forth, the frowning, haughty bride of Ethwald. Elb. Wonderful man! If hell or fortune fight for thee I know not, Nothing withstands thy power. [Exeunt: Ethw. leading off Elb. in triumph, and Dwina following, with her hands and eyes raised to heaven in astonishment. ACT V. SCENE I. An arched passage from a gateway in the royal castle. The sound of warlike music without. Enter Ethelbert and Selred with their followers, as if just come from a long march: enter, by the opposite side, Alwy, upon which they halt, the foremost of the followers but just appearing under the gateway. Alwy. Welcome, most valiant chieftains! Fame reports That crown'd with full success ye are return'd. Eth. Good sooth, we boast but little of our arms; Though Woggarwolfe, our base ignoble spoiler, Wounded and sorely shent, we've left behind, Again in cloister'd walls with ghostly men, Winding his soul, with many a heavy groan, Into a saintly frame! God speed the work! We are but just in time to save our halls. Sel. It is a shame that such a ruffian thief Should thus employ the arms of warlike Thanes. Alwy. In truth it is, but now there reigns in Mercia A warlike king, who better knows to deal With valiant men. The messenger inform'd you? Sel. He did; yet, be it own'd, to call him king Sounds strangely in our ears. How died king Oswal? Eth. (to Sel.) Patience, my friend! good time will show thee all. Yet pray inform us, Alwy, ere we part, Where is young Edward? in these late commotions What part had he? Alwy. Would to the holy saints I could inform you! Reports there are, incongruous and absurdâ Some say, in hunting from his followers stray'd, Passing at dusk of eve a high-swoln stream, Therein he perish'd; others do maintain That, loathing greatness, he conceals himself In some lone cave: but as I bear a heart True to King Ethwald and the public weal, I know of him no more. Sel. Thou liest! Eth. (pulling back Sel.) Peace, art thou mad? Alwy (pretending not to hear). What said brave Selred? Eth. A hasty exclamation of no meaning. Alwy. I must away, and bear the welcome tidings Of your arrival to the royal ear. Eth. But stop, before thou goest I fain would know How fared Elburga in the passing storm? Where has she refuge found? Alwy. Within these walls; she is the queen of Mercia. Eth. I am indebted to thee. [Exit Alwy. Sel. (staring with surprise upon Ethelbert). What dost thou think of this? Did we hear truly? To the usurper of her father's crown, And, if our fears be true, his murd'rer too! To him! O most unnatural! Eth. Ay, so it is. As one, who ventures forth After an earthquake's awful visitation, The country round in strange unwonted guise Beholds; here swelling heights and herby knolls, Where smok'd the cottage and the white flocks browz'd, Sunk into turbid pools; there rifted rocks, With all their shaggy woods upon their sides, In the low bosom of the flowery vale Resting uncouthlyâeven so does he, Who looks abroad after the storms of state, Strange changes see; unnatural and strange. Sel. It makes my spirit boilâthe gentle Edward! So gently brave! Eth. Yes, there is cause of grief And indignation too: but Ethwald reigns, Howe'er he gain'd his height, and he possesses The qualities that suit his lofty station. With them I fear he has his passions also, Hostile to public good: be it our part To use the influence we still retain O'er his ambitious mind for Mercia's weal! This is our duty now. Sel. I'll take thy counsel. (To the soldiers.) Follow, weary comrades. [Exeunt Eth. and Sel. and their followers, marching across the stage. SCENE II. A royal apartment. Elburga, as queen, discovered sitting on a chair of state, with Dwina, ladies, and officers of state attending. Elb. We've waited long: how goes the day? knowst thou? (To 1st officer.) 1st off. As comes the light across this arched roof From those high windows, it should wear, methinks, Upon noon-day. Elb. And the procession to the royal chapel Should at this hour begin. The king, perchance, Is with affairs detain'd: go thou and see. [Exit 1st officer. I am impatient now. [Voice heard without. What voice is that? First SONG without. Hark! the cock crows, and the wind blows, Away, my love, away! Quick, don thy weeds and tell thy beads, For soon it will be day. 1st lady. 'Tis sadly wild. Dwi. 'Tis sad, but wondrous sweet. Who may it be? List, list! she sings again. Second SONG without. Where layst thou thy careless head? On the cold heath is my bed, Where the moor-cock shuts his wing, And the brown snake weaves his ring. Safe and fearless will I be, The coiled adder stings not me. Elb. (rising, displeased, from her seat). Call those who wait without. What may this mean? Enter an Attendant. Whose voice is that which in a day of joy Such plaintive music makes? Atten. Pardon, my royal dame! be not offended! 'Tis a poor maid bereaved of her mind. Rent are her robes, her scatter'd locks unbound, Like one who long through rugged ways hath stray'd, Beat with the surly blast; but never yet, Though all so sorely shent, did I behold A fairer maid. She aims at no despite: She's wild, but gentle. Dwi. O hark again! Third SONG without. For this third song, which is the only literary assistance either in verse or prose that I have ever received, I am indebted to the pen of a friend. Once upon my cheek He said the roses grew, But now they're wash'd away With the cold ev'ning dew. For I wander through the night, When all but me take rest, And the moon's soft beams fall piteously Upon my troubled breast. [A pause. Fourth SONG. Ah, maiden! bear the biting smart, Nor thus thy loss deplore; The Thane's fair daughter has his heart, He will return no more. 1st lady. 'Tis strangely melancholy. Dwi. 'Tis like the mournful sounds which oftentimes The midnight watcher, in his lonely tower, Hears with the wailing blast most sweetly mingled. Elb. (to attendant). Go thou and lead her hither. Atten. I will, great queen.âBut here she comes unbidden. Enter Bertha, with a wild unsettled air, and her hair scattered upon her shoulders. The ladies gather about her with curiosity. 1st lady. How fair she is! 2d lady. Her eyes of lovely blue, Gentle, but restless. Dost thou see that glance? [To 1st lady. I fear to look upon her. Dwi. Fie, fie upon it! press not near her thus; She seems offended: I will speak to her. (To Berth.) Sweet lady, art thou sad? [Bertha looks steadfastly at her, then drops her head upon her breast, and makes no answer. We would be kind to thee. [Berth. then looks more gently on her, but is still silent. 1st lady. Dost thou not speak, thou who canst sing so well? Dwi. Who taught thee those sweet notes? Berth. The night was dark: I met spirits on my way: They sang me sweet songs, but they were sorrowful. Dwi. Ah, woe is me! and dost thou wander then, In the dark night alone, no one to tend thee? Berth. When the moon's dark, I follow the night-bird's cry, And it doth guide my way.âBut he'll return, So do they tell me, when sweet violets blow, And summer comes again. Dwi. And who is he? Berth. List, and the winds will tell thee as they pass: The stilly air will whisper it. But softly, Tell it to none again. They must not know How stern he is, for he was gentle once. Dwi. A cruel heart had he who could forsake thee! Ber. (putting her hand eagerly on Dwina 's mouth). Hush, hush! we'll not offend him. He is great, And must not be offended. Elb. (coming near her). What, sayst thou he is great? Rent are thy weeds, and thin thy ruffled robe: Why didst thou leave thy home thus unprotected? Ber. (turning hastily upon her). I saw his banner streaming in the air, And I did follow it. Elb. His banner in the air! What is thy love? Berth. (looking fiercely at her). They say he is a king. Elb. (smiling). Poor maid! 'tis ever thus with such as she; They still believe themselves of some high state, And mimic greatness. Berth. Thou art a fair dame and a gayâbut go; Take off thine eyes from me; I love thee not. [Shrinks from Elburga, walking backwards, and looking frowningly at her; then beckoning to Dwina, she speaks in her ear. They say a royal dame has won his faith, Stately and proud. But in a gloomy dream I heard it first, confused and terrible: And oftimes, since, the fiend of night repeats it, As on my pressed breast he sits and groans. I'll not believe it. Dwi. What is thy name, sweet lady? Berth. (rubbing her hand across her forehead as if trying to recollect). I had a name that kind friends call'd me by; And with a blessing did the holy man Bestow it on me. But I've wander'd far Through wood and wilds, and strangely on my head The numbing winds have beat, and I have lost it. Be not offended with meâ For, lady, thou art gentle, and I fear thee. [Bowing submissively to Dwina. Enter Ethelbert. Eth. (to Dwina, after looking at Bertha). What maid is that so haggard and so wild? Dwi. A wand'ring maniac, but so fair and gentle Thou needs must speak to her. Eth. (going up to Bertha). Fair lady, wilt thou sufferâgracious heaven! What see I here! the sweet and gentle Bertha! Ah, has it come to this! Alas, alas! Sweet maiden, dost thou know me? Berth. (after looking earnestly at him). I know thee well enough. They call thee mad; Thy wild and raving words oft made the ears Of holy men to tingle. Eth. She somewhat glances at the truth. Alas! I've seen her gay and blooming as the rose, And cheerful, too, as song of early lark, I've seen her prattle on her nurse's lap, Innocent bud! and now I see her thus. [Weeps. Berth. Ah! dost thou weep? are they unkind to thee? [Shaking her head. Yes, yes! from out the herd, like a mark'd deer, They drive the poor distraught. The storms of heaven Beat on him: gaping hinds stare at his woe; And no one stops to bid heav'n speed his way. Eth. (flourish of trumpets). Sweet maid, retire. Berth. Nay, nay! I will not go: there be without Those who will frown upon me. Eth. (endeavouring to lead her off). I pray thee be entreated! [Dwina takes hold of her also to lead her off, but she breaks from them furiously. Berth. Ye shall not force me! Wist ye who I am? The whirlwind in its strength contends with me, And I o'ermaster it. Eth. Stand round her then, I pray you, gentle ladies! The king must not behold her. [The ladies gather round Bertha, and conceal her. Enter Ethwald, followed by Thanes and Attendants. Ethw. (after returning the obeisance of the assembly). This gay and fair attendance on our person, And on our queen, most honour'd lords and dames, We much regard; and could my heart expressâ [Bertha, hearing his voice, shrieks out. What cry is that? Dwi. Regard it not: it is a wand'ring maid, Distracted in her mind, who is in search, As she conceits it, of some faithless lover. She sings sweet songs of wildest harmony, And at the queen's command we led her in. Ethw. Seeking her love! distracted in her mind! Have any of my followers wrong'd her? Speak! If so it be, by righteous heaven I swear! The man, whoe'er he be, shall dearly rue it. [Bertha shrieks again, and, breaking through the crowd, runs up to Ethwald. He starts back, and covers his eyes with one hand, whilst she, catching hold of the other, presses it to her breast. Berth. I've found thee now, and let the black fiend growl, I will not part with thee. I've follow'd thee Through crag and moor and wild. I've heard thy voice Sound from the dark hill's side, and follow'd thee. I've seen thee on the gath'ring twilight clouds, Ride with the stately spirits of the storm. But thou lookst sternly on me. O be not angry! I will kneel to thee; For thou art glorious now, as I am told, And must have worship. (Kneeling, and bowing her head meekly to the ground.) Ethw. (turning away). O God! O God! Where art thou, Ethelbert? Thou mightst have saved me this. [Looking round, and seeing that Ethelbert weeps, he also becomes softened, and turns to Bertha with great emotion. Berth. They say she's fair and glorious: woe is me! I am but form'd as simple maidens are. But scorn me not; I have a powerful spell, A Druid gave it me, which on mine arm When once enclasp'd, will make me fair as she; So thou wilt turn to me. Ethw. O Ethelbert! I pray thee pity me! This sight doth move me, e'en to agony. Remove her hence; but O deal gently with her! [Ethelbert endeavours again to lead her off, and the ladies crowd about her. She is then carried out, and is heard to scream as they are carrying her. Ethw. (in great disorder). Come, come away! we do but linger here. [Elburga, who, since Ethwald 's entering, has remained in the background, but agitated with passions, now advances angrily to him Elb. So thou hast known this maid? Ethw. Fie! speak not to me now. Elb. Away, away! Thou hast lodg'd softer passions in thy breast Than I have reckon'd on. Ethw. (shaking her off). Fie! turn thy face aside, and shade thine eyes! That no soft passion in thy bosom lives, Is thy opprobrium, woman, and thy shame. Elb. There are within my breast such thoughts, I trust, As suit my lofty state. Ethw. (aside to Elb.) Go, heartless pageant, go, Lead on thy senseless show, and move me not To do thee some despite. (Aloud to the ladies.) Move on, fair dames. [To Elb., who seems unwilling to go. The king commands it. [Exeunt Elburga and ladies. 1st off. (to Ethw., who stands with his eyes fixed on the ground). Please you, my lord, but if you move not also, The ceremony will, in sooth, appear As marr'd and cut in twain. Ethw. What sayst thou, marshal? 1st off. Please you, my lord, to move? Ethw. Ay, thou sayst well: in the soul's agony A meaner man might turn aside and weep. [Exit Ethw. with part of his train, the others ranging themselves in order to follow him. A great confusion and noise is then heard without, and a voice calling out âThe king is wounded.â The crowd press back again in disorder, and presently re-enter Ethw. supported. 1st off. My lord, how is it with you? Ethw. I fear but ill, my friend. Where is the man That gave me this fell stroke? 1st off. I cannot tell: they have surrounded him. Enter 2d Officer. 2d off. He is secured. Ethw. Is it a Mercian hand? 2d off. It is, my lord, but of no high degree. It is the frantic stroke of a poor groom, Who did his late lord love; and, for that crime, Last night, with wife and children weeping round him, Was by your soldiers turn'd into the cold, Houseless and bare. Ethw. Curse on their ruffian zeal! Torment him not, but let him die in peace. Would I might sayâ. I'm very faint, my friends: Support me hence, I pray you! [Exeunt, Ethw. supported. SCENE III. A royal apartment: an open door in front, showing an inner chamber, in which is discovered Ethwald lying upon a couch, and surrounded with the Thanes and Officers of his court, Selred and Ethelbert standing on each side of him. Sel. (after Ethw. has said something to him in a low voice). He is too much inclosed and longs for air: He'll breathe more freely in the outer chamber, Let us remove him. [They lift him in his couch, and bring him forward to the front of the stage. 1st off. How are you now, my lord? Ethw. Somewhat exhausted: and albeit, good Thanes, I greatly am indebted to your love, For a short space I fain would be alone. 1st off. Farewell! God send your highness rest! meantime We'll pray for your recovery. 2d off. And heaven will hear our prayers. Omnes. Amen, amen! Ethw. Pray heaven to order all things for the weal Of my good realm, and I shall be well pleased To live or die. Adieu! [Exeunt all but Ethw., Selred, and Ethelbert. After a pause, in which Ethw. seems agitated and uneasy. My dearest Selred, think it not unkind, But go thou too. [Exit Selred. [Raising himself on the couch, and taking both the hands of Ethelbert, which he presses in his, looking up in his face expressively for some time before he speaks. I am oppress'd. To them, even in this state, I still must be a king: to you, my friend, Let me put off all seeming and constraint, And be a poor weak man. (A pause.) Thou speakest not, Thy face is sad and solemn. Well I see Thou lookst upon me as a dying wretchâ There is no hope. Eth. Much will it profit thee To be prepared as though there were no hope; For if thou liv'st thou'lt live a better man, And if thou diest, may heav'n accept it of thee! Ethw. O that it would! But, my good Ethelbert, To be thus seized in my high career, With all my views of glory op'ning round meâ The Western state e'en now invites mine arms. And half Northumberland, in little time, Had been to Mercia join'd. Eth. Nay, think not now, I pray thee, of these matters! They mix uncouthly with the pious thoughts That do become your state. Ethw. I know it well; But they do press so closely on my heartâ O I did think to be remember'd long! Like those grand visitations of the earth, That on its alter'd face for ages leave The traces of their might. Alas, alas! I am a powerful, but a passing storm, That soon shall be forgotten! Eth. I do beseech thee think of better things! Ethw. Thou seest I weep.âBefore thee I may weep. [Dropping his head upon his breast, and groaning deeply. Long have I toil'd and stain'd my hands in blood To gain pre-eminence; and now, alas! Newly arrived at this towering height, With all my schemes of glory rip'ning round me, I close mine eyes in darkness, and am nothing. Eth. What, nothing sayst thou? Ethw. O no, Ethelbert! I look beyond this world, and look with dread, Where all for me is fearful and unknown. Death I have daily braved in fields of fight, And, when a boy, oft on the air-hung bough I've fearless trod, beneath me roaring far The deep swoln floods, with every erring step Instant destruction. Had I perish'd thenâ Would that I had, since it is come to this! [Raising up his hands vehemently to heaven. Eth. Be not so vehement: this will endanger The little chance thou still mayst have for life. The God we fear is merciful. Ethw. Ay, He is merciful; but may it reachâ O listen to me!âOswal I have murder'd, And Edward, brave and gentleâay, this bites With a fell tooth!âI vilely have enthrall'd; Of all his rights deprived. The loving Bertha: Too well thou knowst what I have been to herâ Ah! thinkest thou a thousand robed priests Can pray down mercy on a soul so foul? Eth. The inward sighs of humble penitence Rise to the ear of heav'n, when pealed hymns Are scatter'd with the sounds of common air; If I indeed may speak unto a king Of low humility. Ethw. Thy words bite keenly, friend. O king me not! Grant me but longer life, and thou shalt see What brave amends I'll make for past offences. Thou thinkest hardly of me; ne'ertheless, Rough as my warrior's life has been, good thoughts Have sometimes harbour'd here. [Putting his hand on his heart. If I had lived, It was my full intent that, in my power, My people should have found prosperity: I would have proved to them a gen'rous lord. If I had livedâAh! thinkst thou, Ethelbert, There is indeed no hope? Eth. I may not flatter you. Ethw. (holding up his clasped hands). Then heaven have mercy on a guilty soul! Good Ethelbert, full well thou knowst that I No coward am: from power of mortal thing I never shrank. O might I still contend With spear and helm, and shield and brandish'd blade! But I must go where spear and helm and shield Avail not: Where the skill'd warrior, cased in iron, stands Defenceless as the poor uncrusted worm. Some do conceit that disembodied spirits Have in them more capacity of woe Than flesh and blood maintain. I feel appall'd: Yes, Thane of Sexford, I do say appall'd. For, ah! thou knowst not in how short a space The soul of man within him may be changed. Eth. I know it all too well. But be more calm; Thou hast a task to do, and short perhaps May be the time allow'd thee. True repentance With reparation of offences past Is ever yok'd. Declare it as thy will That Edward do succeed unto his rights: And for poor Bertha, she shall be my charge; I'll tend and cheer her in my quiet home. Ethw. Thou dost prevent my boon: heaven bless thee for it! I give thee power to do whate'er thou thinkst I living should have done. 'Tis all I can, And gracious heaven accept it at my hands! Eth. Amen, my friend! I'll faithfully fulfil The important trustâHa! how thy visage changes! Thy mind's exertion has outrun thy strength. He faints away. Help! who attends without? Enter Selred with Attendants. Support the king: whether a sudden faint Or death be now upon him, trow I not, But quickly call the queen. Sel. Alas, my brother! [Assisting Eth. to raise Ethw.'s head. Eth. Raise him gently, Selred. For, if that life within him still remain, It may revive him. Sel. Ah, see how changed he is! Alas, my brother! Pride of my father's house, is this thy end? Enter Elburga, Nobles, &amp;c. Elb. Let me approach unto my royal lord. Good Ethelbert, thou long hast known thy king, Look'd he e'er thus before? [Looking on Ethw. Eth. No, royal dame; and yet 'tis but a faint; See, he revives again. Ethw. (opening his eyes). Who are about me now? Eth. The queen and nobles. Sel. And Selred, too, is here, my dearest Ethwald! Ethw. (holding out his hand to Sel.) Ay, noble brother, thou wert ever kind. Faintness returns again; stand round, my friends, And hear my dying words. It is my will That Ethelbert shall, after my decease, With the concurrence of the nation's council, The kingdom settle as may best appear To his experienced wisdom, and retain Until that settlement the kingly power. Faintness returns again; I say no more. Art thou displeas'd, my Selred? Sel. (kneeling and kissing his hand). No, brother, let your dying will bereave me E'en of my father's lands, and with my sword I will maintain it. Ethw. Thou art a gen'rous brother; fare thee well! Elb. What, is the queen, indeed, so poor a thing In Mercia's state that she should be o'erpass'd, Unhonour'd and unmention'd? Ethw. (to Elb., waving his hand faintly). Be at peace! Thou shalt have all things that become thy state. (To attendants.) Lower my head, I pray you. 1st off. He faints again. 2d off. He will not hold it long: The kingdom will be torn with dire contentions. And the Northumbrian soon will raise his head. Ethw. (raising himself eagerly with great vehemence). Northumberland! Oh I did purpose soon, With thrice five thousand of my chosen men, To have compass'd his proud towers. Death, death! thou art at hand, and all is ended! [Groans, and falls back upon the couch. 1st off. This is a faint from which I fear, brave Thanes, He will awake no more. 2d off. Sayst thou? go nearer and observe the face. 1st off. If that mine eyes did ever death behold, This is a dead man's visage. 2d off. Let us retire. My good lord Ethelbert, You shall not find me backward in your service. 1st off. Nor me. Omnes. Nor any of us. Eth. I thank you, Thanes! 'Tis fit you should retire; But Selred and myself, and, of your number, Two chosen by yourselves, will watch the body. [To Dwina, who supports Elburga, and seems soothing her. Ay, gentle Dwina, soothe your royal mistress, And lead her hence. [After looking steadfastly on the body. Think ye, indeed, that death hath dealt his blow? 1st off. Ah, yes, my lord! that countenance is death! [Selred kneels by the body, and hides his head. Eth. Then peace be to his spirit! A brave and daring soul is gone to rest. Thus powerful death th' ambitious man arrests, In midst of all his great and towering hopes, With heart high swoln; as the omnipotent frost Seizes the rough enchafed northern deep, And all its mighty billows, heav'd aloft, Boldly commixing with the clouds of heaven, Are fix'd to rage no more. [The curtain drops. PART SECOND. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Ethwald. Ethelbert. Selred. Edward. Alwy. Hereulf. Hexulf. Ongar. Thanes, soldiers, &amp;c. &amp;cWOMEN Elburga. Dwina. Ladies, attendants, &amp;c. &amp;c. ACT I. SCENE I. A gloomy apartment in an old Saxon castle, with small grated windows very high from the ground. Edward is discovered, sitting by a table, and tracing figures with chalk upon it, which he frequently rubs out again; at last, throwing away the chalk, he fixes his eyes upon the ground, and continues for some time in a melancholy musing posture. Enters to him the Keeper, carrying something in his hand. Edw. What brings thee now? it surely cannot be The time of food: my prison hours are wont To fly more heavily. Keep. It is not food: I bring wherewith, my lord, To stop a rent in these old walls, that oft Hath griev'd me, when I've thought of you o' nights; Through it the cold wind visits you. Edw. And let it enter! it shall not be stopp'd. Who visits me besides the winds of heaven? Who mourns with me but the sad sighing wind? Who bringeth to mine ear the mimick'd tones Of voices once belov'd, and sounds long past, But the light-wing'd and many voiced wind? Who fans the prisoner's lean and fever'd cheek, As kindly as the monarch's wreathed brows, But the free piteous wind? I will not have it stopp'd. Keep. My lord, the winter now creeps on apace: Hoar frost this morning on our shelter'd fields Lay thick, and glanced to the up-risen sun, Which scarce had power to melt it. Edw. Glanced to th' up-risen sun! Ay, such fair morns, When ev'ry bush doth put its glory on, Like to a gemmed bride! Your rustics, now, And early hinds, will set their clouted feet Through silver webs, so bright and finely wrought As royal dames ne'er fashion'd, yet plod on Their careless way, unheeding. Alas, how many glorious things there be To look upon! Wear not the forests, now, Their latest coat of richly varied dyes? Keep. Yes, good my lord, the cold chill year advances; Therefore, I pray you, let me close that wall. Edw. I tell thee no, man; if the north air bite, Bring me a cloak.âWhere is thy dog to-day? Keep. Indeed I wonder that he came not with me As he is wont. Edw. Bring him, I pray thee, when thou com'st again. He wags his tail and looks up to my face With the assured kindliness of one Who has not injur'd me. How goes your sport? Keep. Nobly, my lord; and much it pleases me To see your mind again so sooth'd and calm. Edw. I thank thee: knowst thou not that man is form'd For varied states; to top the throne of power, Or in a toad's hole squat, shut from the light? He can bear all things; yet, if thou hast grace, Lead me for once into the open air To see the woods, and fields, and country round, In the fair light of heaven. Keep. I must not do it; I am sworn to this; But all indulgence suited to this state Of close confinement, gladly will I grant. Edw. A faithful servant to a wicked lord, Whoe'er he be, art thou. Is Oswal dead? Or does some powerful Thane his power usurp? [A pause. Thou wilt not answer me. [A horn heard without. Keep. Ha! who is at the gate that sounds so boldly? I'll mount this tower and see. [Exit hastily, and Edward takes his seat again as before. Keep. (without, calling down from the tower). It is a company of armed men, Bearing a royal ensign. Edw. (starting from his seat). Then let me rise and brace my spirits up! They bring me death or freedom! Re-enter Keeper from the tower. (Eagerly to him.) What thinkst thou of it? Keep. I'll to the gate, and meet them instantly. [Exit crossing over the stage hastily. Edw. (alone). An it be death they'll do it speedily, And there's the end of all. Ah, liberty! An it be thou, enlarger of man's self!â My heart doth strangely beat as though it were. I hear their steps already: they come quickly: Ah! how step they who joyful tidings bear! Keep. (calling without to Edw. before they enter). My lord, my lord! you're a free man again! Edw. Am I? great God of heaven, how good Thou art! Enter two Thanes, conducted by the Keeper. Edw. (accosting them). Brave men, ye come upon a blessed errand, And let me bless you. 1st Th. With joy unto ourselves we bring, my lord, Your full enlargement from the highest power, That Mercia now obeys. Edw. Not from king Oswal? 2d Th. No, most noble ethling; From the Lord Regent Ethelbert we come. Edw. Mine uncle, then, is dead. 2d Th. E'en so, my lord. Edw. Ah! good and gentle, and to me most kind! (Weeps, hiding his face.) Died he peacefully? 1st Th. He is at peace. Edw. Ye are reserv'd with me. But ye are wise perhaps; time will declare it. Give me your hands; ye are my loving friends. And you, good guardian of this castle, too, You have not been to me a surly keeper. [Taking the Thanes warmly by the hand, and afterwards the keeper. [A second horn sounds without very loud. 1st Th. Ha! at our heels another messenger So quickly sent! [Exit keep. 2d Th. What may this mean? Edw. Nay, wait not for him here. Let us go forth from these inclosing walls, And meet him in the light and open day. 1st Th. 'Tis one, I hope, sent to confirm our errand: How came he on so quickly? Edw. Thou hopest, Thane? Oh! then thou doubtest too. [Pauses and looks earnestly in their faces. Enter Ongar, conducted by the keeper. 1st Th. (to Ongar). Thine errand? Ongar. That thou shalt know, and the authority Which warrants it. You here are come, grave Thanes, Upon the word of a scarce-named regent, To set this pris'ner free; but I am come With the sign'd will of Ethwald to forbid it; And here I do retain him. (Laying hold of Edw.) 1st Th Loose thy unhallow'd grasp, thou base deceiver! Nor face us out with a most wicked tale. We left the king at his extremity, And long are this he must have breath'd his last. Ongar. Art thou in league with death to know so well When he perforce must come to sick men's beds? King Ethwald lives, and will live longer too Than traitors wish for. Look upon these orders; Knowest thou not his sign? (Showing his warrant.) (Both Thanes, after reading it.) 'Tis wonderful! Ongar. Is it so wonderful A wounded man, fainting with loss of blood And rack'd with pain, should seem so near his end, And yet recover? 2d Th. Ethwald then lives? Ongar. Ay, and long live the king! Edw. What words are these? I am as one who in a misty dream, Listens to things wild and fantastical, Which no congruity nor kindred bear To preconceiv'd impressions. King Ethwald, said ye? and is Ethwald king? 1st Th. He did succeed your uncle. Edw. And by his orders am I here detain'd? 1st Th. Even so, my lord. Edw. It cannot be. (Turning to 2d Th.) Thou sayst not so, good Thane? 2d Th. I do believe it. Edw. Nay, nay, ye are deceiv'd. (Turning to Ongar.) What sayst thou? Was I by Ethwald's orders here imprison'd? Ongar. Yes, yes; who else had power or will to do it? Edw. (holding his clasped hands). Then hope farewell! My gleam is dark; my rest is in the dust! O that an enemy had done this wrong! But Ethwald, thou, who to my heart wert press'd As dearest brother never was by him Who shar'd his mother's breast! Thou in whose fame I gloriedâI who spoke not of my own!â When shouting crowds proclaim'd thy honour'd name, I ever join'd with an ungrudging heart: Yea, such true kindred feeling bore I to him, E'en at his praise I wept. I pray you, sirs! (Bursting into tears.) This hath o'ercome me. Ongar (to Thanes). Why do you tarry here? You've seen my warrant. Depart with me and leave the prisoner. 1st Th. What, shall we leave him in this piteous state, Lone and uncomforted? Ongar. It must be so, there is no time to lose. Come, follow me; my men are at the gate. [As they are all about to depart, Edward, starting furiously forward to the door, flies upon Ongar, and seizes him by the throat. Edw. What! leave me here, fiend! Am I not a man, Created free to breathe the circling air, And range the boundless earth as thy base self, Or thy more treach'rous lord? thou tyrant's slave! [As he struggles with him, Ongar calls loudly, and immediately the apartment is filled with armed men, who separate them. Ongar (to his followers). Remove that madman to the inner chamber. Keeper, attend your duty. (To the Thanes.) Follow me. [Exeunt Ongar and Thanes, &amp;c. Keep. (to Edw., as some remaining armed men are leading him off by the opposite side). Alas! alas! my lord, to see you thus, In closer bondage! Pray! good soldiers, pray! Let him in this apartment still remain: He'll be secure; I'll pledge my lifeâ Edw. No, no! Let them enchain me in a pitchy gulph! 'Twere better than this den of weariness, Which my soul loathes. What care I now for ease? [Exeunt, Edw. led off by the men. SCENE II. An apartment in the royal castle. Enter Ethelbert meeting with Selred, who enters at the same time from a door at the bottom of the stage. Eth. How didst thou leave the king? Sel. Recovering strength with every passing hour. His spirits too, that were so weak and gloomy, From frequent fainting and the loss of blood, Now buoyant rise, and much assist the cure Which all regard as wonderful. Eth. It has deceiv'd us, yet I've heard of such. Sel. Thou lookest sadly on it: how is this? With little cost of thought I could explain In any man but thee that cloudy brow; But well I know thou didst not prize the power With which thou wert invested. Eth. Selred, this hasty gloom will prove too short To work in Ethwald's mind the change we look'd for. And yet he promis'd well. Sel. Ay, and will well perform; mistrust him not. I must confess, nature has form'd his mind Too restless and aspiring: and of late. Having such mighty objects in his grasp, He has too reckless been of others' rights. But, now that all is gain'd, mistrust him not: He'll prove a noble king; a good one too. Eth. Thou art his brother. Sel. And thou his friend. Eth. I stand reprov'd before thee. A friend, indeed, should gentler thoughts maintain, And so I will endeavour. Sel. Give me thy valiant hand; full well I know The heart which it pertains to. Eth. I hear him, now, within his chamber stir. Sel. Thou'lt move him best alone. God speed thy zeal! I'll stand by thee the while and mark his eye. [Eth. remains on the front of the stage whilst Ethwald enters behind him from the door at the bottom of the stage, leaning upon an attendant. Ethw. (to Sel. as he goes up to Eth.) How, Ethelbert, our friend, so deep in thought? (To the attendant.) Leave me awhile methinks a brother's arm Will be a kindlier staff. [Exit attendant, and he leans upon Sel. How, Ethelbert, my friend! What vision from the nether world of sprites Now rises to thine eyes, thus on the ground So fix'd and sternly bent? Eth. Pardon, my lord! my mind should now be turn'd To cheerful thoughts, seeing you thus restor'd. How fares it with you? Ethw. E'en as with one, on a rude mountain's side, Who suddenly in seeming gloom enclos'd Of drizzly night, athwart the wearing mist Sees the veil'd sun break forth in heav'n's wide arch, And showing still a lengthen'd day before him. As with a trav'ller in a gloomy path, Whose close o'er-shaded end did scare his fancy With forms of hidden ill; who, wending on With fearful steps, before his eyes beholds On the sudden burst a fair and wide expanse Of open country, rich in promis'd good. As one o'erwhelmed in the battle's shock, Who, all oppress'd and number'd with the slain, Smother'd and lost, with sudden impulse strengthen'd, Shakes the foul load of dead men. from his back, And finds himself again standing erect, Unmaim'd and vigorous. As one who stoodâ But it may tire thee with such ample scope To tell indeed how it doth fare with me. Eth. You truly are from a dark gloom restor'd To cheerful day; and, if the passing shade Has well impress'd your mind, there lies before you A prospect fair indeed. Ay, fairer far Than that the gloom obscured. Ethw. How sayst thou? Eth. Did not that seeming cloud of death obscure To your keen forecast eye tumultuous scenes Of war and strife, and conquest yet to come, Bought with your people's blood? but now, my Ethwald, Your chasten'd mind, so rich in good resolves, Hath stretch'd before it future prospect fair, Such as a god might please. Ethw. How so, good Ethelbert? Eth. And dost thou not perceive? O see before thee Thy native land, freed from the ills of war, And hard oppressive power, a land of peace! Where yellow fields unspoil'd, and pastures green, Mottled with herds and flocks, who crop secure Their native herbage, nor have ever known A stranger's stall, smile gladly. See through its tufted alleys to heav'n's roof The curling smoke of quiet dwellings rise: Whose humble masters, with forgotten spear Hung on the webbed wall, and cheerful face In harvest fields embrown'd, do gaily talk Over their ev'ning meal, and bless king Ethwald, The valiant yet the peaceful, whose wise rule, Firm and rever'd, has brought them better days, Than e'er their fathers knew. Ethw. A scene, indeed, fair and desirable; But, ah, how much confin'd! Were it not work A god befitting, with exerted strength, By one great effort to enlarge its bounds, And spread the blessing wide? Eth. (starting back from him). Ha! there it is! that serpent bites thee still! O spurn it, strangle it! let it rise no more! Sel. (laying his hand affectionately on Ethwald 's breast). My dearest brother, let not such wild thoughts Again possess your mind! Ethw. Go to! go to! (To Sel.) But, Ethelbert, thou'rt mad. (Turning angrily to Eth.) Eth. Not mad, my royal friend, but something griev'd To see your restless mind still bent on that, Which will to you no real glory bring, And to your hapless people many woes. Ethw. Thou greatly errest from my meaning, friend. As truly as thyself I do regard My people's weal, and will employ the power Heav'n trusts me with, for that important end. But were it not ignoble to confine In narrow bounds the blessed power of blessing, Lest, for a little space, the face of war Should frown upon us? He who will not give Some portion of his ease, his blood, his wealth, For others' good, is a poor frozen churl. Eth. Well, then again a simple warrior be, And thine own ease, and blood, and treasure give: But whilst thou art a king, and wouldst bestow On people not thine own the blessed gift Of gentle rule, earn'd by the public force Of thine own subjects, thou dost give away That over which thou hast no right. Frown not: I will assert it, crown'd and royal lord, Though to your ears full rude the sound may be. Ethw. Chaf'd Thane, be more restrain'd. Thou knowest well, That, as a warlike chieftain, never yet The meanest of my soldiers grasp'd his spear To follow me constrain'd; and as a king, Thinkst thou I'll be less noble? Sel. Indeed, good Ethelbert, thou art too warm; Thou dealest hardly with him. Eth. I know, though peace dilates the heart of man And makes his stores increase, his count'nance smile, He is by nature form'd, like savage beasts, To take delight in war. 'Tis a strong passion in his bosom lodg'd, For ends most wise, curb'd and restrain'd to be; And they who for their own designs do take Advantage of his nature, act, in truth, Like cruel hinds who spirit the poor cock To rend and tear his fellow. O thou! whom I so often in my arms, A bold and gen'rous boy have fondly press'd, And now do proudly call my sov'reign lord, Be not a cruel master! O be gentle! Spare Mercian blood! Goodness and power make Most meet companions. The great Lord of all, Before whose awful presence, short while since, Thou didst expect to stand, almighty is, Also most merciful: And the bless'd Being He to earth did send To teach our soften'd hearts to call him Father, Most meekly did confine His heavenly power Unto the task assign'd Him. Think of this. O! dost thou listen to me? Ethw. (moved and softened). Yes, good Ethelbert. Be thou more calm: we will consider of it. We should desire our people's good, and peace Makes them to flourish. We confess all this; But circumstance oft takes away the power Of acting on it. Still our Western neighbours Are turbulent and bold; and, for the time, Though somewhat humbled, they again may rise And force us to the field. Sel. No, fear it not! they are inclin'd to peace; Tidings I've learnt, sent by a trusty messenger, Who from Caernarvon is with wondrous speed But just arriv'd: their valiant prince is dead. A sudden death has snatch'd him in his prime; And a weak infant, under tutorage Of three contending chiefs of little weight, Now rules the state, who, thou mayst well perceive, Can give thee no disturbance. Ethw. (eagerly, with his eyes lightening up, and his whole frame agitated). A trusty messenger has told thee this? O send him to me quickly! still fair fortune Offers her favours freely. Send him quickly! Ere yet aware of my returning health, Five thousand men might without risk be led E'en to their castle walls. Eth. What, meanst thou this? Uprous'd again unto this dev'lish pitch? Oh, it is horrid! Ethw. (in great heat). Be restrained, Thane. Eth. Be thou restrained, king. See how thou art, Thus feebly tott'ring on those wasted limbs? And wouldst thou spoil the weak? (Observing Ethw. who staggers from being agitated beyond his strength.) Ethw. (pushing away Selred, who supports him). I do not want thine aid: I'm well and vig'rous: My heart beats strongly, and my blood is warm; Though there are those who spy my weakness out To shackle me withal. Ho, thou without! [Enter his attendant, and Ethw., taking hold of him, walks across the stage; then turning about to Sel. and Eth. Brother, send quickly for your trusty messenger; And so, good day. Good morning, Thane of Sexford. (Looking sternly to Ethelbert.) Eth. Good morning, Mercia's king. [Exeunt by opposite sides, frowningly. SCENE III. A grand apartment, with a chair of state. Enter Hexulf and Alwy, engaged in close conversation. Alwy (continuing to speak). Distrust it not; The very honours and high exaltation Of Ethelbert, that did your zealous ire So much provoke, are now the very tools With which we'll work his ruin. Hex. But still proceed with caution; gain the queen; For she, from ev'ry hue of circumstance, Must be his enemy. Alwy. I have done that already, By counterfeiting Ethwald's signature Whilst in that still and deathlike state he lay, To hinder Ethelbert's rash treach'rous haste From setting Edward free, I have done that For which, though Ethwald thanks me, I must needs, On bended knee, for courtly pardon sue. The queen I have address'd with humble suit My cause to plead with her great lord, and she Will her magnificent and high protection Give to our party, e'en if on her mind No other motive press'd. Hex. I doubt it not, and yet I fear her spirit, Proud and aspiring, will desire to rule More than befits our purpose. Alwy. Fear it not. It is the show and worship of high state That she delights in, more than real power: She has more joy in stretching forth her hand And saying, âI command,â than, in good truth, Seeing her will obey'd. Enter Queen, with Dwina and Attendants. Hex. Saint Alban bless you, high and royal dame! We are not here, in an intruding spirit, Before your royal presence. Queen. I thank you, good lord bishop, with your friend. And nothing doubt of your respect and duty. Alwy. Thanks, gracious queen! This good and holy man Thus far supports me in your royal favour, Which is the only rock that I would cling to, Willing to give me friendly countenance. Queen. You have done well, good Alwy, and have need Of thanks more than of pardon; nevertheless, If any trouble light on thee for this, A royal hand shall be stretch'd forth to save you, Whom none in Mercia, whosoe'er they be, Will venture to oppose. I will protect thee, And have already much inclin'd the king To favour thee. Alwy (kneeling and kissing her hand). Receive my humble thanks, most honour'd queen. My conscience tells me I have merited, Of you and of the king, no stern rebuke; But that dark cunning Thane has many wiles To warp men's minds e'en from their proper good. He has attempted, or report speaks falsely, To lure King Ethwald to resign his crown. What may he not attempt! it makes me shrink! He trusts his treasons to no mortal men: Fiends meet him in his hall at dead of night, And are his counsellors. Queen (holding up her hands). Protect us, heaven! Hex. Saint Alban will protect you, gracious queen. Trust me, his love for pious Oswal's daughter Will guard you in the hour of danger. Hark! The king approaches. [Flourish of trumpets. Queen. Yes, at this hour he will receive in state The bold address of those seditious Thanes, Clam'ring for peace, when fair occasion smiles, And beckons him to arm and follow her. Hex. We know it well; of whom Thane Ethelbert, In secret is the chief, although young Hereulf By him is tutor'd in the spokesman's office. Enter Ethwald, attended by many Thanes and Officers of the Court, &amp;c. Queen (presenting Alwy to Ethw.). My lord, a humble culprit at your feet, Supported by my favour, craves forgiveness. [Alwy kneels, and Ethw. raises him graciously. Ethw. I grant his suit, supported by the favour Of that warm sense I wear within my breast Of his well-meaning zeal. (Looking contemptuously at the Queen, who turns haughtily away.) But wherefore, Alwy, Didst thou not boldly come to me at first And tell thy fault? Might not thy former services Out-balance well a greater crime than this? Alwy. I so, indeed, had done, but a shrewd Thane, Of mind revengeful, and most penetrating, Teaches us caution in whate'er regards His dealings with the state. I fear the man. Ethw. And wherefore dost thou fear him? Alwy (mysteriously). He has a cloudy brow, a stubborn gait; His dark soul is shut up from mortal man, And deeply broods upon its own conceits Of right and wrong. Hex. He has a soul black with foul atheism And heresies abominable. Nay, He has a tongue of such persuasive art, That all men listen to him. Queen (eagerly). More than men: Dark spirits meet him at the midnight hour, And horrid converse hold. Ethw. No, more I pray you! Ethelbert I know. Queen. Indeed, indeed, my lord, you know him not! Ethw. Be silent, wife! (Turning to Hex. and Al.) My tried and faithful Alwy, And pious Hexulf, in my private closet We further will discourse on things of moment, At more convenient time. The leagued Thanes advance. Retire, Elburga: Thou hast my leave. I gave thee no command To join thy presence to this stern solemnity. Soft female grace adorns the festive hall, And sheds a brighter lustre on high days Of pageant state; but in an hour like this, Destin'd for gravest audience, 'tis unmeet. Queen. What, is the queen an empty bauble, then, To gild thy state withal? Ethw. The queens of Mercia, first of Mercian dames, Still fair example give of meek obedience To their good lords. This is their privilege. [Seeing that she delays to go. It is my will. A good day to your highness. Queen (aside as she goes off). Be silent, wife! this Mollo's son doth say Unto the royal offspring of a king. [Exit Queen, frowning angrily, and followed by Dwina and attendants. The Thanes, who entered with Ethwald, and during his conversation with Alwy, &amp;c. had retired to the bottom of the stage, now come forward. Ethw. Now wait we for those grave and sluggish chiefs, Who would this kingdom, fam'd for warlike Thanes, Change into mere provision-land to feed A dull unwarlike race. Alwy. Ay, and our castles, Whose lofty walls are darken'd with the spoils Of glorious war, to barns and pinning folds, Where our brave hands, instead of sword and spear, The pruning knife and shepherd's staff must grasp. Hex. True; sinking you, in such base toils unskill'd, Beneath the wiser carl. This is their wish, But heav'n and our good saint will bring to nought Their wicked machinations. Enter an Officer of the castle. Off. Th' assembled Thanes, my lord, attend without. Ethw. Well, let them enter. Our seat beneath us will not shake, I trust, [Exit off. Being so fenced round. (Taking his seat, and bowing courteously with a smiling countenance to the Chiefs, &amp;c. who range themselves near him.) Enter several Thanes, with Hereulf at their head, and presently after followed by Ethelbert. Her. (stretching out his hand with respectful dignity). Our king and sire, in true and humble duty We come before you, earnestly entreating Your royal ear to our united voice. Ethw. Mine ear is ever open'd to the words Of faithful duty. Her. We are all men, who in th' embattled field Have by your side the front of danger braved, With greater lack of prudence than of daring; And have opposed our rough and scarred breasts To the fell push of war, with liberality Not yielding to the bravest of your Thanes, The sons of warlike sires. But we are men, Who in our cheerful halls have also been Lords of the daily feast; where, round our boards, The hoary headed warrior, from the toil Of arms releas'd, with the cheer'd stranger smiled: Who in the humble dwellings of our hinds Have seen a numerous and hardy race, Eating the bread of labour cheerfully, Dealt to them with no hard nor churlish hand. We, therefore, stand with graceful boldness forth The advocates of those who wish for peace. Worn with our rude and long continued wars, Our native land wears now the alter'd face Of an uncultur'd wild. To her fair fields, With weeds and thriftless docks now shagged o'er, The aged grandsire, bent and past his toil, Who in the sunny nook had plac'd his seat, And thought to toil no more, leads joyless forth His widow'd daughters and their orphan train, The master of a silent, cheerless band. The half-grown stripling, urged before his time To manhood's labour, steps, with feeble limbs And sallow cheek, around his unroof'd cot. The mother on her last remaining son With fearful bodings looks. The cheerful sound Of whistling ploughmen, and the reaper's song, And the flail's lusty stroke is heard no more. The youth and manhood of our land are laid In the cold earth, and shall we think of war? O, valiant Ethwald! listen to the calls Of gentle pity, in the brave most graceful, Nor, for the lust of more extended sway, Shed the last blood of Mercia. War is honourable In those who do their native rights maintain; In those whose swords an iron barrier are Between the lawless spoiler and the weak: But is in those who draw th' offensive blade For added power or gain, sordid and despicable, As meanest office of the worldly churl. Ethw. Chiefs and assembled Thanes, I much commend The love you bear unto your native land. Shame to the son nurs'd on her gen'rous breast Who loves her not! and be assured that I, Her reared child, her soldier, and her king, In true and warm affection yield to none Of all who have upon her turfy lap Their infant gambols held. To you her weal Is gain and pleasure; glory 'tis to me. To you her misery is loss and sorrow; To me disgrace and shame. Of this be satisfied; I feel her sacred claims, which these high ensigns Have fastened on me, and I will fulfil them: But for the course and manner of performance, Be that unto the royal wisdom left, Strengthen'd by those appointed by the state To aid and counsel it. Ye have our leave, With all respect and favour to retire. Her. We will retire, King Ethwald, as becomes Free, independent Thanes, who do of right Approach or quit at will the royal presence, And lacking no permission. Alwy. What, all so valiant in this princely hall, Ye who would shrink from the fair field of war, Where soldiers should be bold? Her. (laying his hand on his sword). Thou liest, mean boastful hireling of thy lord, And shalt be punish'd for it. 1st Th. (of Ethwald 's side). And dar'st thou threaten, mouth of bold sedition? We will maintain his words. [Draws his sword, and all the Thanes on the King's side do the same. Hereulf and the Thanes of his side also draw their swords. 1st Th. (of Hereulf 's side). Come on, base dealers in your country's blood. 1st Th. (of Ethwald 's side). Have at ye, rebel cowards! Ethw. (rising from his seat, and standing between the two parties in a commanding posture). I do command you: peace and silence, chiefs! He who with word or threat'ning gesture dares The presence of his king again to outrage, I put without the covert of the law, And on the instant punish. [They all put up their swords, and Ethwald, after looking round him for some moments with commanding sternness, walks off majestically, followed by his Thanes. Eth. (casting up his eyes to heaven as he turns to follow Hereulf and his party). Ah, Mercia, Mercia! on red fields of carnage Bleed thy remaining sons, and carrion birds Tear the cold limbs that should have turn'd thy soil. [Exeunt the two different parties by opposite sides. ACT II. SCENE I. A small cavern, in which is discovered a wizard, sitting by a fire of embers, baking his scanty meal of parched corn, and counting out some money from a bag; a book and other things belonging to his art are strewed near him on the ground. Wiz. (alone). Thanks to the restless soul of Mollo's son! Well thrives my trade. Here, the last hoarded coin Of the spare widow, trembling for the fate Of her remaining son, and the gay jewel Of fearful maid, who steals by fall of eve, With muffled face, to learn her warrior's doom, Lie in strange fellowship; so doth misfortune Make strange acquaintance meet. Enter a Scout. Brother, thou com'st in haste; what news, I pray? Scout. Put up thy book, and bag, and wizard's wand: This is no time for witchery and wiles. Thy cave, I trow, will soon be fill'd with those, Who are by present ills too roughly shent To look through vision'd spells on those to come. Wiz. What thou wouldst tell me, tell in plainer words. Scout. Well, plainly then, Ethwald, who thought full surely The British, in their weak-divided state, To the first onset of his arms would yield Their ill-defended towers, has found them strengthen'd With aid from Wessex. and unwillingly Led back with cautions skill the Mercian troops; Meaning to tempt the foe, as it is thought, To follow him into our open plains, Where they must needs with least advantage fight. Wiz. Who told thee this? Scout. Mine eyes have seen them. Scarcely three miles off, The armies, at this moment, are engaged In bloody battle. On my way I met A crowd of helpless women, from their homes Who fly with terror, each upon her back Bearing some helpless babe or valued piece Of household goods snatch'd up in haste. I hear Their crowding steps e'en now within your cave: They follow close behind. Enter a crowd of women, young and old, some leading children and carrying infants on their backs or in their arms, others carrying bundles and pieces of household stuff. Wiz. Who are ye, wretched women, Who, all so pale and haggard, bear along Those hapless infants, and those seeming wrecks, From desolation saved? What do you want? 1st wom. Nought but the friendly shelter of your cave, For now or house, or home, or blazing hearth, Good wizard. we have none. Wiz. And are the armies then so near your dwellings? 1st wom. Ay, round them, in them the loud battle clangs. Within our very walls fierce spearmen push, And weapon'd warriors cross their clashing blades. 2d wom. Ah, woe is me! our warm and cheerful hearths, And rushed floors, whereon our children play'd, Are now the bloody lair of dying men. Old wom. Ah, woe is me! those yellow thatched roofs, Which I have seen these sixty years and ten, Smoking so sweetly 'midst our tufted thorns, And the turf'd graves wherein our fathers sleep! Young wom. Ah, woe is me! my little helpless babes! Now must some mossy rock or shading tree Be your cold home, and the wild haws your food. No cheerful blazing fire and seething pot Shall now, returning from his daily toil, Your father cheer! if that, if that indeed Ye have a father still. [Bursting into tears. 3d wom. Alack, alack! of all my goodly stuff I've saved but only this! my winter's webs, And all the stores that I so dearly saved! I thought to have them to my dying day! Enter a young man leading in an idiot. Young wom. (running up to him). Ah, my dear Swithick! art thou safe indeed? Why didst thou leave me? Young man. To save our idiot brother, seest thou here? I could not leave him in that pitiless broil. Young wom. Well hast thou done! poor helpless Balderkin! We've fed thee long, unweeting of our care, And in our little dwelling still thou'st held The warmest nook; and wheresoe'er we be, So shalt thou still, albeit thou knowst it not. Enter man carrying an old man on his back. Young man. And see here, too, our neighbour Edwin comes, Bearing his bed-rid father on his back. Come in, good man. How dost thou, aged neighbour? Cheer up again! thou shalt be shelter'd still; The wizard has receiv'd us. Wiz. True, good folks; I wish my means were better for your sakes. But we are crowded here; that winding passage Leads us into an inner cave full wide, Where we may take our room and freely breathe; Come, let us enter there. [Exeunt, all following the wizard into the inner cave. SCENE II. A field of battle strewed with slain, and some people seen upon the background searching amongst the dead bodies. Enter Hereulf and Ethelbert. Her. (stopping short, and holding up his hands). Good mercy! see at what a bloody price Ethwald this doubtful victory has purchased, That, in the lofty height to which he climbs, Will be a little step of small advantage. Eth. (not attending to him, and after gazing for some time on the field). So thus ye lie, who, with the morning sun, Rose cheerily, and girt your armour on With all the vigour, and capacity, And comeliness of strong and youthful men. Ye also, taken in your manhood's wane, With grizzled pates, from mates, whose wither'd hands For some good thirty years had smooth'd your couch: Alas! and ye whose fair and early growth Did give you the similitude of men Ere your fond mothers ceas'd to tend you still, As nurslings of their care, ye lie together! Alas! alas! and many now there be, Smiling and crowing on their mother's breast, Twining, with all their little infant ways, Around her hopeful heart, who shall like these, Be laid i' the dust. Her. Ay, so it needs must be, since Mollo's son Thinks Mercia all too strait for his proud sway. But here come those who search among the dead For their lost friends; retire, and let us mark them. [They withdraw to one side. Enter two Ceorls, meeting a third, who enters by the opposite side. 1st Ceorl. (to 3d). Thou hast been o'er the field? 3d Ceorl. I have, good friend. 2d Ceorl. Thou hast seen a rueful sight. 3d Ceorl. Yes, I have seen that which no other sight Can from my fancy wear. Oh! there be some Whose writhed features, fix'd in all the strength Of grappling agony, do stare upon you, With their dead eyes half open'd.â And there be some, struck through with bristling darts, Whose clenched hands have torn the pebbles up; Whose gnashing teeth have ground the very sand. Nay; some I've seen among those bloody heaps, Defaced and 'reft e'en of the form of men, Who in convulsive motion yet retain Some shreds of life more horrible than death; I've heard their groans, oh, oh! (A voice from the ground.) Baldwick! 3d Ceorl. What voice is that? it comes from some one near. 1st Ceorl. See, yon stretch'd body moves its bloody hand: It must be he. (Voice again.) Baldwick! 3d Ceorl (going up to the body from whence the voice came). Who art thou, wretched man? I know thee not. Voice. Ah, but thou dost! I have sat by thy fire, And heard thy merry tales. and shared thy meal. 3d Ceorl. Good holy saints! and art thou Athelbald? Woe! woe is me to see thee in such case! What shall I do for thee? Voice. If thou hast any love or mercy in thee, Turn me on my face that I may die; For lying thus, seest thou this flooded gash? The glutting blood so bolsters up my life I cannot die. 3d Ceorl. I will, good Athelbald. Alack the day! That I should do for thee so sad a service! [Turns the soldier on his face. Voice. I thank thee, friend, farewell! [Dies. 3d Ceorl. Farewell! farewell! a merry soul thou wert, And sweet thy ploughman's whistle in our fields. 2d Ceorl (starting with horror). Good heaven forefend! it moves! 1st Ceorl. What dost thou see? 2d Ceorl. Look on that bloody corse, so smear'd and mangled, That it has lost all form of what it was; It moves! it moves! there is life in it still. 1st Ceorl. Methought it spoke, but faint and low the sound. 3d Ceorl. Ha! didst thou hear a voice? we'll go to it. Who art thou? Oh! who art thou? [To a fallen warrior, who makes signs to him to pull something from his breast. Yes, from thy breast; I understand the sign. [Pulling out a band or 'kerchief from his breast. It is some maiden's pledge. Fallen warrior (making signs). Upon mine arm, I pray thee, on mine arm. 3d Ceorl. I'll do it, but thy wounds are past all binding. Warrior. She who will search for me doth know this sign. 3d Ceorl. Alack, alack: he thinks of some sad maid! A rueful sight she'll see! He moves again: Heaven grant him peace! I'd give a goodly sum To see thee dead, poor wretch! Enter a woman, wailing and wringing her hands. 2d Ceorl. Ha! who comes wailing here? 3d Ceorl. Some wretched mother who has lost her son: I met her searching midst the farther dead, And heard her piteous moan. Mother. I rear'd him like a little playful kid, And ever by my side, where'er I went, He blithely trotted. And full soon, I ween, His little arms did strain their growing strength To bear my burden. Ay, and long before He had unto a stripling's height attain'd, He ever would my widow's cause maintain With all the steady boldness of a man. I was no widow then. 2d Ceorl. Be comforted, good mother. Mother. What sayst thou to me? Knowst thou where he lies? If thou hast kindness in thee, tell me truly; For dead or living still he is mine all, And let me have him. 3d Ceorl (aside to 2d). Lead her away, good friend; I know her now. Her boy is lying with the farther dead, Like a fell'd sapling: lead her from the field. [Exeunt mother and 2d Ceorl. 1st Ceorl. But who comes now, with such distracted gait, Tossing her snowy arms unto the wind, And gazing wildly o'er each mangled corse? Enter a young woman, searching distractedly amongst the dead. Young wom. No, no! thou art not here! thou art not here! Yet, if thou be like these, I shall not know thee. Oh! if they have so gash'd thee o'er with wounds, And marr'd thy comely form! I'll not believe it. Until these very eyes have seen thee dead, These very hands have press'd on thy cold heart, I'll not believe it. 3d Ceorl. Ah, gentle maiden! many a maiden's love, And many a goodly man lies on this field. Young wom. I know, too true it is, but none like him. Liest thou, indeed, amongst those grisly heaps? O thou! who ever wert of all most fair! If heav'n hath suffer'd this, amen, amen! Whilst I have strength to crawl upon the earth, I'll search thee out, and be where'er thou art, Thy mated love, e'en with the grisly dead. [Searching again amongst the dead, she perceives the band round the arm of the fallen warrior, and uttering a loud shriek, falls senseless upon the ground. The Ceorls run to her assistance, with Eth. and Her. who come forward from the place they had withdrawn to: Her. clenches his hand, and mutters curses upon Mollo 's son, as he crosses the stage. The scene closes. SCENE III. A castle not far from the field of battle. Enter Ethwald and Alwy, talking as they enter. Ethw. (calling angrily to some one off the stage). And see they do not linger on the road, With laggard steps; I will brook no delay. (To Alwy.) Why, even my very messengers, of late Slothful and sleepy-footed have become: They too must cross my will. [Throws himself upon a seat and sits for some time silent and gloomy. Alwy. Your highness seems disturb'd. What though your arms, amidst those British hills, Have not, as they were wont, victorious prov'd, And home retreating, even on your own soil, You've fought a doubtful battle: luckless turns Will often cross the lot of greatest kings; Let it not so o'ercome your noble spirit. Ethw. Thinkest thou it o'ercomes me? [Rising up proudly. Thou judgest poorly. I am form'd to yield To no opposed pressure, nor my purpose With crossing chance or circumstance to change. I in my march, to this attained height Have moved still with an advancing step, Direct and onward; But now the mountain's side more rugged grows, And he who would the cloudy summit gain, Must oft into its cragged rents descend The higher but to mount. Alwy. Or rather say, my lord, that having gain'd Its cloudy summit, there you must contend With the rude tempests that do beat upon it. Ethw. (smiling contemptuously). Is this thy fancy? Are thy thoughts of Ethwald So poorly limited, that thou dost think He has already gain'd his grandeur's height? Know that the lofty point which oft appears, To him who stands beneath, the mountain's top, Is to the daring climber who hath reach'd it Only a breathing place, from whence he sees Its real summit, bright and heav'n-illum'd, Towering majestic, grand, above him far, As is the lofty spot on which he stands To the dull plain below. The British once subdued, Northumberland, Thou seest well, could not withstand our arms. It too must fall; and with such added strength, What might not be achiev'd? Ay, by this arm! All that the mind suggests, even England's crown, United and entire. Thou gazest on me. I know full well the state is much exhausted Of men and means; and those curs'd Mercian women To cross my purposes, with hag-like spite, Do nought but females bear. But I will onward. Still conscious of its lofty destination, My spirit swells, and will not be subdued. Alwy. I, chidden, bow, and yield with admiration Unto the noble grandeur of your thoughts. But lowering clouds arise; events are adverse; Subdue your secret enemies at home, And reign securely o'er the ample realm You have so bravely won. Ethw. What! have I through the iron fields of war Proudly before th' admiring gaze of men, Unto this point with giant steps held on, Now to become a dwarf? Have I this crown In bloody battles won, mocking at death, To wear it now as those to whom it comes By dull and leaden-paced inheritance; As the dead shepherd's scrip and knotted crook Go to his milk-fed son? Like those dull images, On whose calm, tamed brows, the faint impression Of far preceding heroes faintly rests, As the weak colours of a fading rainbow On a spent cloud! I'd rather in the centre of the earth Inclosed be, to dig my upward way To the far distant light, than stay me thus, And, looking round upon my bounded state, Say, this is all. No; lower as it may, I'll to the bold aspirings of my mind Still steady prove, whilst that around my standard Harness doth clatter, or a falchion gleam. Alwy. What boot the bold aspirings of the great, When secret foes beneath his footsteps work Their treach'rous mine? Ethw. Ay, thou before hast hinted of such foes. Alwy. Fear for your safety, king, may make me err: But these combined chiefs, it is full plain, Under the mask of zeal for public good, Do court with many wiles your people's hearts; Breathing into their ears the praise of peace, Yea, and of peaceful kings. The thralled Edward, Whose prison-tower stands distant from this castle But scarce a leagueâ Ethw. (starting). Is it so near us? Alwy. It is, my lord. Nor is he so forgotten in the land, But that he still serves their dark purpose well. An easy gentle princeâso brave, yet peacefulâ With such impressions clogg'd your soldiers fight, And therefore 'tis that with a feeble foe Ethwald fights doubtful battles. Ethw. Thou art convinced of this? Alwy. Most perfectly. Ethw. I too have had such thoughts, and have repress'd them. Alwy. Did not those base petitioners for peace Withhold their gather'd forces, till beset On ev'ry side they saw your little army, Already much diminish'd? then came they, Like heaven-commission'd saviours, to your aid, And drew unto themselves the praise of all. This plainly speaks, your glory with disgrace They fain would dash, to set their idol up; For well they think, beneath the gentle Edward To lord it proudly, and his gen'rous nature Has won their love and pity. Ethelbert Now that such fair occasion offers to them, The prisoner's escape may well effect: He lacks not means. Ethw. (after a thoughtful pause). Didst thou not say, that castle's foggy air, And walls with dampness coated, to young blood Are hostile and creative of disease? In close confinement he has been full long; Is there no change upon him? Alwy. Some hardy natures will resist all change. [A long pause, in which Ethwald seems thoughtful and disturbed. Ethw. (abruptly). Once in the roving fantasies of night, Methought I slew him. Alwy. Dreams, as some think, oft show us things to come. [Another long pause, in which Ethwald seems greatly disturbed, and stands fixed to one spot, till catching Alwy 's eye fastened steadfastly upon his, he turns from him abruptly, and walks to the bottom of the stage with hasty strides. Going afterwards to the door, he turns suddenly round to Alwy just as he is about to go out. Ethw. What Thane was he, who, in a cavern'd vault, His next of kin so long imprison'd kept, Whilst on his lands he liv'd? Alwy. Yes, Ruthal's Thane he was; but dearly he The dark contrivance rued; fortune at last The weary thrall reliev'd, and ruin'd him. Ethw. (agitated). Go where thy duty calls thee; I will in: My head feels strangely; I have need of rest [Exit. Alwy (looking after him with a malicious satisfaction). Ay, dark perturbed thoughts will be thy rest. I see the busy workings of thy mind. The gentle Edward has not long to mourn His earthly thraldom. I have done my task, And soon shall be secure; for while he lives, And Ethelbert, who hates my artful rise, I live in jeopardy. [Exit. SCENE IV A small dark passage. Enter Ethwald with a lamp in his hand: enter at the same time, by the opposite side, a domestic officer; they both start back on seeing one another. Ethw. Who art thou? Off. Baldwin, my lord. But mercy on my sight, Your face is strangely alter'd. At this hour Awake, and wandering thus!âHave you seen aught? Ethw. No, nothing. Knowst thou which is Alwy's chamber? I would not wake my grooms. Off. It is that farther door; I'll lead you to it. [Pointing off the stage. Ethw. No, friend, I'll go myself. Good rest to thee. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A small dark chamber, with a low couch near the front of the stage, on which Alwy is discovered asleep. Enter Ethwald with a haggard countenance, bearing a lamp. Ethw. He sleepsâI hear him breatheâhe soundly sleeps, Seems not this circumstance to check my purpose, And bid me still to pause? (Setting down the lamp.) But wherefore pause? This deed must be, or, like a scared thief Who starts and trembles o'er his grasped store At ev'ry breezy whisper of the night, I now must wear this crown, which I have bought With brave men's blood, in fields of battle shed. Ah! would that all it cost had there been shed! This deed must be; for, like a haggard ghost His image haunts me wheresoe'er I move, And will not let me rest. His love hath been to me my bosom's sting; His gen'rous trust hath gnaw'd me like a worm. Oh! would a swelt'ring snake had wreath'd my neck When first his arms embraced me! He is by fortune made my bane, my curse, And, were he gentle as the breast of love, I needs must crush him. Prison'd or free, where'er he breathes, lives one Whom Ethwald fears. Alas! this thing must be, From th' imaged form of which I still have shrunk, And started back as from my fancy's fiend. The dark and silent cope of night is o'er us, When vision'd horrors, through perturbed sleep, Harden to deeds of blood the dreamer's breast; When from the nether world fell demons rise To guide with lurid flames the murd'rer's way. I'll wake him now; should morning dawn upon me, My soul again might from its purpose swerve. (In a loud energetic voice.) Alwy, awake! sleepest thou? sleepest thou, Alwy? (Alwy wakes.) Nay, rouse thyself, and be thou fully waking. What I would say must have thy mind's full bent; Must not be spoken to a drowsy ear. Alwy (rising quickly). I fully am awake; I hear, I see, As in the noon of day. Ethw. Nay, but thou dost not. Thy garish eye looks wildly on the light, Like a strange vistor. Alwy. So do the eyes of one pent in the dark, When sudden light breaks on them, though he slept not. But why, my lord, at this untimely hour, Are you awake, and come to seek me here? Ethw. Alwy, I cannot sleep: my mind is toss'd With many warring thoughts. I am push'd on To do the very act from which my soul Has still held back: fate doth compel me to it. Alwy. Being your fate, who may its power resist? Ethw. E'en call it so, for it, in truth, must be. Knowst thou one who would do a ruthless deed, And do it pitifully? Alwy. He who will do it surest, does it best! And he who surely strikes, strikes quickly too, And therefore pitifully strikes. I know A brawny ruffian, whose firm clenched gripe No struggles can unlock; whose lifted dagger, True to its aim, gives not a second stroke! Ethw. (covering his face hastily). Oh! must it needs be so? (Catching Alwy eagerly by the arm.) But hark thee well! I will have no foul butchery done upon him. Alwy. It shall be done, e'en to the smallest tittle, As you yourself shall order. Ethw. Nay, nay! do thou contrive the fashion of it, I've done enough. Alwy. But, good my lord! cast it not from you thus: There must be warrant and authority For such a deed, and strong protection too. Ethw. Well, well, thou hast it all: thou hast my word. Alwy. Ay, but the murder'd corse must be inspected, That no deceit be fear'd, nor after doubts; Nor bold impostors rising in the North, Protected by your treach'rous Thanes, and plum'd, To scare you afterwards with Edward's name. Ethw. Have not thine eyes on bloody death oft look'd? Do it thyself. Alwy. If you, my lord, will put this trust in me, Swear that when after-rumours shall arise, As like there may, your faith will be unshaken. Ethw. Yes; I will truly trust theeâ (Vehemently, after a short pause.) No, I will not! I'll trust to no man's vision but mine own. Is the moon dark to-night? Alwy. It is, an please you. Ethw. And will be so to-morrow? Alwy. Yes, my lord. Ethw. When all is still in sleepâI hear a noise. Alwy. Regard it not, it is the whisp'ring winds Along those pillar'd walls. Ethw. It is a strange sound, though. Come to my chamber, I will not here remain: come to my chamber, And do not leave me till the morning break. I am a wretched man! [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. A gloomy vaulted apartment in an old castle, with no windows to it, and a feeble light burning in one corner. Enter Edward from a dark recess near the bottom of the stage, with slow pensive steps, frequently stopping as he advances, and remaining for some time in a thoughtful posture. Edw. Doth the bright sun from the high arch of heaven In all his beauteous robes of flecker'd clouds, And ruddy vapours, and deep glowing flames, And softly varied shades, look gloriously? Do the green woods dance to the wind; the lakes Cast up their sparkling waters to the light? Do the sweet hamlets in their bushy dells Send winding up to heaven their curling smoke On the soft morning air? Do the flocks bleat, and the wild creatures bound In antic happiness, and mazy birds Wing the mid air in lightly skimming bands? Ay, all this is; all this men do behold; The poorest man. Even in this lonely vault, My dark and narrow world, oft do I hear The crowing of the cock so near my walls, And sadly think how small a space divides me From all this fair creation. From the wide spreading bounds of beauteous nature, I am alone shut out; I am forgotten. Peace, peace! He who regards the poorest worm Still cares for me, albeit He shends me sorely. This hath its end. Perhaps, small as these walls, A bound unseen divides my dreary state From a more beauteous world; that world of souls, Fear'd and desir'd by all: a veil unseen Which soon shall be withdrawn. [Casts up his eyes to heaven, and turning, walks silently to the bottom of the stage, then advancing again to the front. The air feels chill; methinks it should be night. I'll lay me down: perchance kind sleep will come, And open to my view an inward world Of garish fantasies, from which nor walls, Nor bars, nor tyrant's power, can shut me out. [He wraps himself in a cloak and lies down. Enter a ruffian, stealing up softly to him as supposing him asleep. Edward, hearing him, uncovers his face, and then starts up immediately. Edw. What art thou? Or man or sprite? Thou lookest wondrous stern, What dost thou want? Com'st thou to murder me? Ruff. Yes, I am come to do mine office on thee; Thy life is wretched, and my stroke is sure. Edw. Thou sayest true; yet, wretched as it is, It is my life, and I will grapple for it. Ruff. Full vainly wilt thou strive, for thinkest thou We enter walls like these with changeling hearts, To leave our work undone? Edw. We, sayest thou? There are more of you then? Ruff. Ay, ay, there are enow to make it sure; But, if thou wilt be quiet, I'll do't myself. Mine arm is strong; I'll give no second stroke; And all escape is hopeless. Edw. What, thinkest thou I'll calmly stretch my neck Until thou butch'rest me? No, by good heaven! I'll grapple with thee still, And die with my blood hot! [Putting himself in a posture of defence. Ruff. Well, since thou'lt have it so, thou soon shalt see If that my mates be lovelier than myself. [Exit. Edw. O that I still in some dark cell could rest, And wait the death of nature! [Looking wildly round upon the roof and walls of the vault. Nor stone, nor club, nor beam to serve my need! Out from the walls, ye flints, and fill my grasp! Nought! nought! Is there not yet within this nook Some bar or harden'd brand that I may clutch? [Exit hastily into the dark recess, and is followed immediately by two ruffians, who enter by the opposite side, and cross the stage after him. SCENE II. An apartment adjoining to the former, with a door leading to it at the bottom of the stage. Enter Alwy with a stern anxious face, and listens at the door; then enter, by the opposite side, Ethwald with a very haggard countenance. Ethw. Dost thou hear aught? Alwy. No, nothing. Ethw. But thou dost: Is it not done? Alwy. I hope it is, my lord. Ethw. Thou doubtest, then.âIt is long past the hour That should have lapp'd it. Hark! I hear a noise. [A noise heard within of people struggling. Alwy. They are dealing with him now. They struggle hard. Ethw. (turning away with horror, and putting his hands upon his ears). Ha! are we then so near it? This is horrid! [After a pause. Is it not done yet? Dost thou hear them still? Alwy. I hear them still: they struggle harder now. [The noise within heard more distinctly. Ethw. By hell's dark host, thy fiends are weak of arm, And cannot do their task! He will break forth, With all the bloody work half done upon him! [Running furiously to the door, and then shuddering, and turning away from it. No, no, I cannot go! do thou go in, And give thy strength. Let him be still'd i' the instant. [A noise heard within of one falling. Alwy. There's no need now: did you not hear him fall? [A groan heard within. And that groan too? List, list! The deed is done. [They both retire from the door, and Ethw. leaning his back against the wall, looks steadfastly towards it in silent expectation, whilst it is seen to open slowly a little way, then shut, then open again, without any one appearing. Ethw. What may this mean? This pause is horrible! Will they or enter quickly or forbear? Enter 1st ruffian, with his hands and clothes bloody, and all his hair and dress in disorder, like one who has been struggling hard. Enter soon after him 2d ruffian in a similar plight. Alwy (eagerly). Ye've done it: is he dead? 1st ruff. He is still'd now; but with such horrid strength He grappled with us! we have had fell work. Alwy. Then let us see the body. 1st ruff. Yes, enter if it please ye. Alwy. Be pleased, my lord. (To Ethw.) Ethw. Pray thee be satisfied: I cannot go. Alwy (to the ruffians). Bring ye the body hither. [Exeunt ruffians. [A silent pause.âRe-enter ruffians bearing the body, and laying it down before Ethw. Look here, my lord, and be well satisfied: It is his very face, though somewhat changed With long confinement in these sickly damps, And the convulsive throes of violent death. Ethw. (first shrinking from it with horror, then commanding himself, and looking upon it for some time steadfastly). Yes, changed indeed! and yet I know it well. Ah! changed indeed! Much he must needs have suffer'd In his lone prison-house. Thou bruised flower! And hast thou struggled all so bravely too For thy most wretched life? Base, bloody work! Remove it from my sight. [Turning hastily from it. Alwy. What farther orders would you give these men? Ethw. Away! speak to me not! thou'st made me curs'd! Would all the realm of Mercia I had lost, Ere it had come to this! Once in the battle's heat I sav'd his life. And he did bless me for it. [Beating his forehead distractedly. Alwy. Nay, good my lord, be not so keenly moved. Where shall we lay the body? Ethw. Thou and those fiends do with it as ye will: It is a damned work! [Exit hastily. Alwy (to 1st ruf.) Come thou with me. (To 2d ruf.) We will return anon; Meanwhile remain thou here and watch the corpse. [Exeunt Alwy and 1st ruf. 2d ruf. (alone). Watch it! I would not watch it here alone For all my ruffian's hire. [Throws a coarse cloth over the body, and exit hastily. SCENE III. A Saxon hall in the former castle. Enter Elb. and Dwina, talking earnestly as they enter. Elb. But didst thou truly question ev'ry groom, And the stern keeper of that postern gate? Dwi. I have, but no one knew that he is absent. 'Twas dark night when the king went forth, and Alwy Alone was with him. This is all I know. Elb Thus secretly, at night! Sexford's castle Is not far distant.âThat distracted maidâ If this be so, by the true royal blood That fills my veins, I'll be reveng'd! What meanst thou? [Seeing Dwina shake her head piteously. Dwi. Alas! you need not fear; far distant stand The towers of Ethelbert; and that poor maid With the quiet dead has found at last her rest. Elb. And is't not well? Why dost thou shake thy head, As though thou toldst sad news?âYet what avails it? I ne'ertheless must be a humble mate, With scarcely e'en the semblance of a queen, And bow my head whilst Mollo's son doth say, âBe silent, wife.ââShall I endure all this? O Edward! gentle ething! thou who once Didst bear the title of my future lord, Wouldst thou have used me thus? I'll not endure it. Dwi. Yet be more patient. Elb. Be patient, sayst thou? Go to, for I hate thee, When thou so calmly talkst. Though seemingly, I oft before his keen commanding eye Submissive am, thinkst thou I am subdued? No, by my royal race! I'll not endure it: I will unto the bishop with my wrongs; Rever'd and holy men shall do me right: And here he comes unsent for; this my hope Calls a good omen. Enter Hexulf. Good and holy father, I crave your blessing. Hex. Thou hast it, royal daughter. Art thou well? Thou seemst disorder'd. Elb. Yes, rev'rend father, I am sorely gall'd Beneath a heavy and ignoble yoke; My crowned head is in subjection bow'd, Like meanest household dame; and thinkest thou That it becomes the daughter of a king, The chief descendant of your royal race, To bear all this, and say that she is well? Hex. My daughter, your great lord indeed is form'd Of soul more stern than was the gentle Edward, On whom your maiden fancy first was taught To dwell with sanguine hope. Elb. O holy Hexulf! thou hast nam'd a name Which to my conscience gives such secret pangs: Oh! I have done such wrong to that sweet youth, My heart bleeds at the cruel thought. I wouldâ Yea, there is nothing that I would not do In reparation of the wrong I've done him. Speak, my good father, if thou aught canst say: Edward, 'tis said, has many powerful friends In secret still devoted to his cause, And not far distant stands his dreary tower. O speak to me!âThou turnst away thy head Disturb'd and frowningly: hast thou no counsel For a soul-smitten and distracted woman? [Laying her clasped hands earnestly on his shoulder, as he turns from her much displeased. Hex. Daughter, forbear! you are indeed distracted. Ethwald, by right of holy bands your lord, Is in his seat too firmly fix'd; and Edward Is only by some restless Thanes desired, Under the influence of that dark wizard, That heretic who still ensnares the young. Be wise then, I beseech you, and in peace Live in the meek subjection of a wife. Elb. (stepping back from him with haughty contempt). And so, meek, holy man, this is your counsel, Breath'd from the gentle spirit of your state. I've seen the chafings of your saintly ire Restrain'd with less concern for sober duty, When aught pertaining to your priestly rights Was therein touch'd. Dwi. Hush! Ethelbert approaches with his friends: They come, methinks, at an unwonted hour. Hex. That artful heretic regards not times; His spells still show to him the hour best suiting His wicked purposes. Dwi. Heaven save us all! methinks at his approach The air grows chill around us, and a hue Of strange unnatural paleness spreads o'er all. Elb. (to Dwi.) Peace, fool! thy fancy still o'ertops thy wit. Enter Selred, Ethelbert, and Hereulf. Eth. In your high presence, gracious dame, we are Thus early visitors, upon our way To crave admittance to the royal chamber. Is the king stirring yet? Forgive my boldness. Elb. Good Ethelbert, thou dost me no offence; And you, Lord Selred, and brave Hereulf too, I bid good morrow to you all. The king Is not within his chamber: unattended Of all but Alwy, at the close of night He did go forth, and is not yet return'd. Sel. This much amazes me: the moon was dark, And cold and rudely blew the northern blast. Dwi. (listening). Hark! footsteps sound along the secret passage: Look to yon door, for something moves the bolt. The king alone that sacred entry treads. Enter Ethwald from a small secret door, followed by Alwy, and starts back upon seeing Ethelbert, &amp;c. Ethw. (recovering from his confusion). A good and early morrow to you all: I little thoughtâyou are astir betimes. Eth. The same to you, my lord, with loving duty. Sel. And you too, royal brother, you are moving At an unwonted hour. But you are pale! A ghastly hollow look is in your eyes! What sudden stratagem of nightly war Has call'd you forth at such untimely season? The night was dark and cold, the north wind blew, And if that I can read that alter'd brow, You come not back unscath'd. Ethw. (confused). No, I am well.âThe blast has beat against me, And tossing boughs my tangled pathway cross'd: In sooth I've held contention with the night. Sel. Yea, in good sooth, thou lookest too like one Who has contention held with damned sprites. Hast thou not cross'd that glen where, as 'tis said, The restless ghost of a dead murd'rer stalks? Thou shudd'rest and art pale! O, thou hast seen it: Thou hast indeed the haggard face of one Who has seen fearful things. Ethw. Thou'rt wild and fanciful: I have seen nothing: I am forespent and faint; rest will restore me. Much good be to you all! (Going.) Eth. (preventing him). Nay, on your royal patience, gracious king. We must a moment's trespass make, to plead For one, upon whose brave but gentle soul The night of thraldom hangs.â Ethw. (shrinking back). I knowâI know thy meaningâspeak it not. It cannot beâthere was a timeâ'tis past. Sel. O say not so; the time for blessed mercy Is ever present. For the gentle Edward, We'll pledge our lives, and give such hostages As shall secure your peace. Eth. Turn not away; We plead for one whose meek and gen'rous soul Most unaspiring is, and full of truth; For one who lov'd you, Ethwald; one by nature Form'd for the placid love of all his kind; One who did ever in your growing fame Take most unenvious joy. Such is our thrall: Yea, and the boon that we do crave for him Is but the free use of his cramped limbs, And leave to breathe, beneath the cope of heaven. The wholesome air; to see the cheering sun; To be again reckon'd with living men. [Kneeling and clasping his knees. Ethw. Let go, dark Thane; thou rackst me with thy words; They are vain sounds:âthe wind has wail'd as thou dost, And pled as sadly too. But that must be What needs must be. Reckon'd with living men! Would that indeedâO would that this could be! The term of all is fix'd.âGood night to youâ IâI should say good morning, but this light Glares strangely on mine eyes. [Breaking from Eth. Sel. (following him). My dearest brother, by a brother's love! Ethw. (putting him away with great agitation). My heart no kindred holds with human thing. [Exit quickly, in great perturbation, followed by Alwy. Sel. and Hereulf (looking expressively at each other, and then at Ethelbert). Good Ethelbert, what ails thee? Her. Thy fix'd look has a dreadful meaning in it. Eth. Let us begone. Sel. No, do not yield it so. I still will plead The gentle Edward's cause: his frowns I fear not. Eth. Come, come; there is no cause; Edward is free. Sel. How so? thou speakst it with a woeful voice. Eth. Is not the disembodied spirit free? Sel. Ha! thinkst thou that?âNo, no; it cannot be. Her. (stamping on the ground, and grasping his sword). I'll glut my sword with the foul murd'rer's blood, If such foul deed hath been. Eth. Hush, hush, intemp'rate boy! Let us begone. [Exeunt Eth., Sel., and Her. Elb. (to Dwi.) Heardst thou how they conceive it? Dwi. Ay, mercy! and it is a fearful thought! It glanc'd e'en o'er my mind before they spoke. Elb. Thou'rt silent, rev'rend father; are thy thoughts Of such dark hue? (With solemn earnestness to Hex.) Hex. Heaven's will be done in all things! erring man Bows silently. Good health attend your greatness. Elb. Nay, go not yet, good Hexulf: in my closet I much desire some converse with thee. Thou, Belike, hast misconceiv'd what I have utter'd In unadvised passion, thinking surely It bore some meaning 'gainst my lord the king. Hex. No, gracious daughter, I indeed receiv'd it As words of passion. You are mov'd, I see: But let not this dismay you: if the king Has done the deed suspicion fastens on him, We o'er his mind shall hold the surer sway. A restless penitent will docile prove To priestly counsel: this will be our gain. But in your closet we'll discourse of this. Heaven's will be done in all things! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The King's chamber. Enter Ethwald with a thoughtful miserable look, and stands silently muttering to himself, when Alwy enters in haste, followed by an Officer. Alwy. Pardon, my lord; we bring you pressing tidings. Ethw. (angrily). Shall I ne'er rest in peace in mine own chamber? Ha! would that peace were there!âYou bring me tidings; And from what quarter come they? Alwy. From Utherbald, who holds your western fortress. Ethw. He doth not yield, I hope, unto the foe. It is my strongest hold, and may defy The strength of Wessex and of Britain join'd. Off. True, king, but famine all things will subdue. Ethw. He has surrender'd, then: by heaven and hell I'll have his head for this! Alwy. No, royal Ethwald, It is not yet so bad; but this brave man, Commission'd by himself, will tell you all. Ethw. Speak, warrior: then he holds the fortress still? Off. He does, my lord, but much he lives in fear, He shall not hold it long, unless your highness Will give your warrant to release the prisoners; Those ill designing Mercians whom your wisdom Under his guard has placed. He bade me say the step is dangerous; But, if it is not done, those idle mouths, Consuming much, will starve him and his men Into compliance with the foe's demand. What is your sov'reign will? for on the instant I must return. Ethw. Tell him this is no time for foolish hazard. Let them be put to death. Off. (shrinking back). Must I return with this? All put to death? Ethw. Yes, I have said: didst thou not hear my words? Off. I heard, in truth, but mine ears strangely rung. Good saints there are, my lord, within our walls, Close pris'ners kept, of war-bred men alone. Of whom, I trow, there scarcely is a man Who has not some fair stripling by his side Sharing the father's bonds, threescore and ten; And must they allâ Ethw. I understand thee, fool. Let them all die! have I not said it? Go: Linger not here, but bear thy message quickly. [Exit officer sorrowfully. (Angrily to Alwy.) What! thou lookest on me too, as if, forsooth, Thou wert amaz'd at this. Perceiv'st thou not How hardly I'm beset to keep the power I have so dearly bought? Shall this impede me? Let infants shrink! I have seen blood enough; And what have I to do with mercy now? [Stalking gloomily away, then returning. Selred and Ethelbert, and fiery Hereulf, Are to their castles sullenly retired, With many other warlike Thanes. The storm Is gath'ring round me, but we'll brave it nobly. Alwy. The discontented chiefs, as I'm inform'd By faithful spies, are in the halls of Hereulf Assembled, brooding o'er their secret treason. Ethw. Are they? Then let us send a chosen band, And seize them unprepared. A nightly march Will bring them near his castle. Let us then Immediate orders give; the time is precious. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. An apartment in the royal castle or chief residence of Ethwald. Dwina and several of the ladies serving the Queen are discovered at work; some spinning, some winding coloured yarns for the loom, and some embroidering after a rude fashion. Dwi. (looking over the 1st lady's work). How speeds thy work? The queen is now impatient; Thou must be diligent. 1st lady. Nine weary months have I, thou knowest well, O'er this spread garment bent, and yet thou seest The half is scarcely done. I lack assistance. Dwi. And so thou dost, but yet in the wide realm None can be found but such as lack the skill For such assistance. All those mingled colours, And mazy circles, and strange carved spots, Look, in good sooth, as though the stuff were strew'd With rich and curious things: though much I fear To tell you what would prove no easy task. 2d lady. There lives a dame in Kent, I have been told, Come from some foreign land, if that indeed She be no cunning fiend in woman's garb, Who, with her needle, can most cunningly The true and perfect semblance of real flowers, With stalk and leaves, as fairly fashion out As if upon a summer bank they grew. 1st lady. Ay, ay! no doubt! thou hearst strange tales, I ween. Didst thou not tell us how, in foreign lands Full far from this, the nice and lazy dames Do set foul worms to spin their silken yarn? Ha, ha! [They all laugh. 2d lady (angrily). I did not say so. 1st lady. Nay, nay, but thou didst! (Laughing.) 2d lady. Thou didst mistake me wilfully, in spite, Malicious as thou art! Dwi. I pray you wrangle not! when ladies work, They should tell pleasant tales or sweetly sing, Not quarrel rudely, thus, like villains' wives. Sing me, I pray you now, the song I love. You know it well: let all your voices join. Omnes. We will, good Dwina. SONG. Wake awhile and pleasant be, Gentle voice of melody! Say, sweet carol, who are they Who cheerly greet the rising day? Little birds in leafy bower; Swallows twitt'ring on the tower; Larks upon the light air borne; Hunters rous'd with shrilly horn; The woodman whistling on his way; The new-waked child at early play, Who barefoot prints the dewy green, Winking to the sunny sheen; And the meek maid who binds her yellow hair, And blithely doth her daily task prepare. Say, sweet carol, who are they Who welcome in the evening grey? The housewife trim and merry lout, Who sit the blazing fire about; The sage a conning o'er his book; The tired wight, in rushy nook, Who half asleep, but faintly hears The gossip's tale hum in his ears; The loosen'd steed in grassy stall; The proud Thanes feasting in the hall; But most of all the maid of cheerful soul, Who fills her peaceful warrior's flowing bowl. Well hast thou said! and thanks to thee, Voice of gentle melody! Dwi. (to 3d lady, who sits sad and pensive). What is the matter, Ella? thy sweet voice Was wont to join the song. Ella. Ah, woe is me! within these castle walls, Under this very tower in which we are, There be those, Dwina, who no sounds do hear But the chill winds that o'er their dungeons howl; Or the still tinkling of the water-drops Falling from their dank roofs, in dull succession, Like the death watch at sick men's beds. Alas! While you sing cheerly thus, I think of them. Dwi. Ay, many a diff'rent lot of joy and grief Within a little compass may be found. Under one roof the woeful and the gay Do oft abide; on the same pillow rest. And yet, if I may rightly judge, the king Has but small joy above his wretched thralls. Last night I listened to his restless steps, As oft he paced his chamber to and fro, Right o'er my head, and I did hear him utter Such heavy groans! 1st lady (with all the others gathering about Dwina curiously). Didst thou? And utter'd he no other sound? I've heard it whisper'd, at the dead of night He sees strange things. All (speaking together). O tell us, Dwina! tell us! Dwi. Out on you all! you hear such foolish tales! He is himself the ghost that walks the night, And cannot rest. Ella. Belike he is devising in his mind How he shall punish those poor prisoners, Who were in Hereulf's tower surpris'd so lately, And now are in these hollow vaults confin'd. 1st lady. No marvel that it should disturb him much, When his own brother is among the guilty. There will be bloody doings soon, I trow! Dwi. Into the hands of good and pious Hexulf The rebels will be put, so to be punish'd As he in holy zeal shall see it meet. Ella. Then they will dearly suffer. Dwi. That holy man no tortures will devise. Ella. Yes, so perchance, no tortures of the flesh; But there be those that do upon the soul The rack and pincer's work. Is he not grandson to that vengeful chief, Who, with the death-axe lifted o'er his head, Kept his imprison'd foe a live-long night, Nor, till the second cock had crow'd the morn, Dealt him the clemency of death? Full well He is his child I know! Dwi. What aileth thee? art thou bewitched also? Lamentest thou that cursed heretics Are put in good men's power? The sharpest punishment O'er-reaches not their crime. Ella. O Dwina, Dwina! thou hast watch'd by me When on a sick-bed laid, and held my head, And kindly wept to see my wasted cheek, And lov'st thou cruelty? It cannot be! Dwi. No, foolish maiden! mercy to such fiends Were cruelty. Ella. Such fiends! Alas! do not they look like men? Do they not to their needful brethren do The kindly deeds of men? Yea, Ethelbert Within his halls a houseless Thane maintain'd, Whose substance had been spent in base attempts To work his ruin. Dwi. The blackest fiends of all most saintly forms Oft wear. Go, go! thou strangely art deluded, I tremble for thee! get thee hence and pray, If that the wicked pity of thy heart May be forgiven thee. Enter a Lady eagerly. Lady. Come, damsels, come! along the gallery, In slow procession holy Hexulf walks, With saintly Woggarwolfe, a fierce chief once, But now a cowled priest of marv'llous grace. They bear some holy relies to the queen; Which, near the royal couch with blessings laid, Will to the king his wonted rest restore. Come, meet them on their way and gain a blessing. Dwi. We will all gladly go. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A royal apartment, lighted only by the moon through the high arched windows. Enter Ethwald, as if just risen from bed, loose and disordered, but bearing a drawn sword in his hand. Ethw. Still must this heavy closeness thus oppress me? Will no fresh stream of air breathe on my brow, And ruffle for a while this stilly gloom? O night, when good men rest, and infants sleep; Thou art to me no season of repose, But a fear'd time of waking more intense, Of life more keen, of misery more palpable! My rest must be when the broad sun doth glare; When armour rings and men walk to and fro; Like a tir'd hound stretch'd in the busy hall, I needs must lie; night will not cradle me. [Looking up anxiously to the windows. What, looks the moon still through that lofty arch? Will't ne'er be morn?âIf that again in strength I led mine army on the bold career So surely shapen in my fancy's eye, I might again have joy; but in these towers, Around, beneath me, hateful dungeons yawn, In every one of which some being lives To curse me. Ethelbert and Selred too, My father's son and my youth's oracle, Ye too are found with those, who raise to heav'n The prisoner's prayer against my hated head. I am a lofty tree of growth too great For its thin soil, from whose wide rooted fangs The very rocks and earth that foster'd it Sever and fall away.âI stand alone! I stand alone! I thought, alas! to spread My wide protecting boughs o'er my youth's friends; But they, like pois'nous brushwood at my root, Have chok'd my stately growth e'en more than all. [Musing for some time gloomily. How marr'd and stinted hath my greatness been! What am I now of that which long ere now I hop'd to be? O! it doth make me mad To think of this! By hell it shall not be! I would cut off this arm and cast it from me For vultures' meat, if it did let or hinder Its nobler fellow. Yes, they shall die! I to my fortune's height Will rear my lofty head, and stand alone, Fearless of storm of tempest. [Turns round his head upon hearing a noise, and seeing Elburga enter at the bottom of the stage, with a lamp in her hand, like one risen from bed, he starts back and gazes wildly upon her. What form is that? What art thou? Speak! speak quickly! If thou indeed be aught of living kind. Elb. Why didst thou start? Dost thou not know me? Ethw. No; Thy shadow seem'd to me a crested youth. Elb. And with that trusty weapon in thy grasp, Which thou, of late, e'en on thy nightly couch Hast sheathless kept, fearest thou living man? Ethw. It was not living man I fear'd. Elb. What then? Last night when open burst your chamber door With the rude blast, which it is wont to do, You gaz'd upon it with such fearful looks Of fix'd expectancy, as one, in truth, Looks for the ent'ring of some dreadful thing. Have you seen aught? Ethw. Get to thy couch. Thinkst thou I will be question'd? Elb. (putting her hand upon his shoulder soothingly). Nay, be not thus uncourtly! thou shalt tell me. Ethw. (shaking her off impatiently). Be not a fool! get thee to sleep, I say! What dost thou here? Elb. That which, in truth, degrades my royal, birth, And therefore should be chid; servilely soothing The fretful moods of one, who, new to greatness, Feels its unwieldy robe sit on his shoulders Constrain'd and gallingly. Ethw. (going up to her sternly and grasping her by the wrist). Thou paltry trapping of my regal state, Which with its other baubles I have snatch'd, Dar'st thou to front me thus? Thy foolish pride, Like the mock loftiness of mimic greatness, Makes us contemned in the public eye, And my tight rule more hateful. Get thee hence; And be with hooded nuns a gorgeous saint, For know thou lackest meekness for a queen. [Elb. seems much alarmed, but at the same time walks from him with great assumed haughtiness, and exit. Ethw. (alone). This woman racks me to the very pitch! Where I should look for gentle tenderness, There find I heartless pride. Ah! there was one Who would have sooth'd my troubles: there was one Who would have cheer'dâBut wherefore think I now? (Pausing thoughtfully.) Elburga has of late been to my will More pliant, oft assuming gentle looks: What may this mean? under this alter'd guise What treach'ry lurks? (Pausing again for some time.) And yet it should not be: Her greatness must upon my fortune hang, And this she knows full well. I've chid her roughly. Some have, from habit and united interest, Amidst the wreck of other human ties, The steadfast duty of a wife retain'd, E'en where no early love or soft endearments The bands have knit. Yes; I have been too rough. [Calling to her off the stage. Elburga! dost thou hear me, gentle wife? And thou com'st at my bidding: this is kindly. Enter Elburga, humbled. Elb. You have been stern, my lord. You think belike, That I have urged you in my zeal too far To give those rebel chieftains up to Hexulf, As best agreeing with the former ties That bound you to those base ungrateful men, And with the nature of their chiefest crime, Foul heresy; but, if in this I err, Zeal for your safety urged me to offend. Ethw. I've been too stern with thee, but heed it not. And in that matter thou hast urged so strongly, But that I much mistrust his cruelty, I would resign those miserable men To Hexulf's vengeful arm; for much he does Public opinion guide, and e'en to us, If now provok'd, might prove a dang'rous foe. Elb. Mistrust him not; he will by oath engage To use no torture. Ethw. And yet methinks, Selred might still be saved. A holy man might well devise the means To save a brother. Elb. He will think of it. Much do the soldiers the bold courage prize, And simple plainness of his honest mind; To slay him might be dangerous. Ethw. Ha! is it so? They've praised him much of late? Elb. Yes, he has grown into their favour greatly. Ethw. The changeful fools! I do remember well They shouted loudly o'er his paltry gift, Because so simply giv'n, when my rich spoils Seem'd little priz'd. I like not this. 'Twere well He were remov'd. We will consider this. Elb. Come to your chamber then. Ethw. No, no! into that dark oppressive den Of horrid thoughts I'll not return. Elb. Not so! I've trimm'd the smould'ring fire, and by your couch The holy things are laid: return and fear not. Ethw. I thank thy kindness; I, indeed, have need Of holy things, if that a stained soul May kindred hold with such. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A vaulted prison. Hereulf, Selred, and three Thanes of their party, are discovered walking gloomily and silently up and down. 1st Th. (to the 2d, who groans heavily). Ah! wherefore, noble partner, art thou thus? We all are brothers, equal in misfortune; Let us endure it nobly! 2d Th. Ay, so I would, but it o'ercometh me. E'en this same night, in my far distant home Fires blaze upon my towers, to guide my steps Through woody dells which I shall pass no more. E'en on this night I promis'd to return. 1st Th. Yet bear it up, and do not dash us thus; We all have pleasant homes as well as thou, To which I fear we shall no more return. Sel. (to 3d Thane, who advances from the bottom of the stage). What didst thou look at yonder? Where is Ethelbert? 3d Th. Within yon deep recess, upon his knees, Just now I saw him, and I turn'd aside, Knowing the modest nature of his worship. Enter Ethelbert from the recess, slowly advancing from the bottom of the stage. But see, he comes, and on his noble front A smiling calmness rests, like one whose mind Hath high communion held with blessed souls. Her. (to Eth.) Where has thou been, brave Ethelbert? Ah! now Full well I see; thy countenance declares. Didst thou remember us? A good man's prayers Will from the deepest dungeon climb heav'n's height, And bring a blessing down. Eth. Ye all are men who with undaunted hearts Most nobly have contended for the right. Your recompense is sure; ye shall be bless'd. 2d Th. How bless'd? With what assurance of the mind Hast thou pray'd for us? Tell us truly, Ethelbert; As those about to die, or those who yet Shall for a term this earthly state retain? Such strong impress'd ideas oft foreshow Th' event to follow. Eth. Man, ever eager to foresee his doom With such conceits his fancy fondly flatters, And I too much have given my mind to this; But let us now, like soldiers on the watch Put our soul's armour on, alike prepared For all a soldier's warfare brings. In heav'n He sits, who on the inward war of souls Looks down, as one beholds a well-fought field, And nobly will reward the brave man's struggle. [Raising his clasped hands fervently. O let Him now behold what His weak creatures, With many cares and fears of nature weak, Firmly relying on His righteous rule, Will suffer cheerfully! Be ye prepared! Her. We are prepared: what say ye, noble colleagues? 1st Th. If that I here a bloody death must meet, And in some nook unbless'd, far from the tombs Of all mine honour'd race, these bones be laid, I do submit me to the will of heaven. 3d Th. E'en so do I in deep submission bow. 2d Th. If that no more within my op'ning gates My children and my wife shall e'er again Greet my return, or this chill'd frame again E'er feel the kindly warmth of home, so be it! His blessed will be done who ruleth all! Her. If these nerv'd arms, full in the strength of youth, Must rot in the earth, and all my glorious hopes To free this land, with which high beat this heart, Must be cut off i' the midst, I bow my spirit To its Almighty Lord; I murmur not. Yet, O that it had been permitted me To have contended in that noble cause! Low must I sleep in an unnoted grave, While the oppressor of my native country Riots in brave men's blood! Eth. Peace, noble boy! he will not riot long. They shall arise, who for that noble cause, With better fortune, not with firmer hearts Than we to the work have yoked, will bravely strive. To future heroes shall our names be known; And in our graves of turf we shall be bless'd. Her. Well then, I'm satisfied: I'll smile in death; Yea, proudly will I smile! it wounds me not. Eth. How, Selred? thou alone art silent here: To heaven's high will what off'ring makest thou? Sel. Nothing, good Ethelbert. What can a man, Little enriched with the mind's rare treasure, And of th' unrighteous turmoil of this world Right weary grown, to his great Maker offer? Yet I can die as meekly as ye will, Albeit of His regard it is unworthy. Eth. Give me thy hand, brave man! Well hast thou said! In truth thy off'ring far outprizes all; Rich in humility. Come, valiant friends; It makes my breast beat high to see you thus For Fortune's worst prepar'd with quiet minds. I'll sit me down awhile; come, gather round me, And for a little space the time beguile With the free use and interchange of thought: Of that which no stern tyrant can control. [They all sit down on the ground. Her. (to Eth.) Nay, on my folded mantle do thou sit. Eth. I thank thee, but I feel no cold. My children! We do but want, methinks, a blazing fire, To make us thus a friendly chosen circle For converse met. Then we belike would talk Of sprites, and magic power, and marv'llous things, That shorten weary hours; now let us talk Of things that do th' inquiring mind of man With nobler wonder fill; that state unseen, With all its varied mansions of delight, To which the virtuous go, when like a dream Struck by the beams of op'ning day, this life, With all its shadowy forms, fades into nothing. 1st Th. Ay, Ethelbert, thou'rt full of sacred lore; Talk thou of this, and we will gladly heart thee. How thinkst thou we shall feel, when, like a nestling Burst from its shell, we wake to this new day? Eth. Why e'en, methinks, like to the very thing To which, good Thane, thou hast compared us; For here we are but nestlings, and I trow, Pent up i' the dark we are. When that shall open Which human eye hath ne'er beheld, nor mind To human body linked, hath e'er conceiv'd, Grand, awful, lovely:âO! what form of words Will body out my thoughts!âI'll hold my peace. [Covers his head with his hand and is silent for a moment. Then like a guised band, that for awhile Has mimick'd forth a sad and gloomy tale, We shall these worthless weeds of flesh cast off, And be the children of our Father's house. Her. (eagerly). But what sayst thou of those who doff these weeds To clothe themselves in flames and endless woe? Eth. Peace to thee! what have we to do with this? Let it be veil'd in night! Her. Nay, nay, good Ethelbert! I fain would know what foul oppression earns; And please my fancy with the after-doom Of tyrants, such as he beneath whose fangs Our wretched country bleeds. They shall be cursed: O say how deeply! Eth. Hereulf, the spirit of Him thou call'st thy master, Who died for guilty men, breathes not in thee. Dost thou rejoice that aught of human kind Shall be accursed? Her. (starting up). If not within the fiery gulf of woe His doom be cast, there is no power above! Eth. For shame, young man! this ill beseems thy state: Sit down and I will tell thee of this Ethwald. Sel. (rising up greatly agitated). O no! I pray thee do not talk of him! The blood of Mollo has been Mercia's curse. Eth. Sit down; I crave it of you both; sit down And wear within your breasts a manlier spirit. [Pointing to Her. to sit close by him. Nay here, my son, and let me take thy hand. Thus by my side, in his fair op'ning youth, Full oft has Ethwald sat and heard me talk, With, as I well believe, a heart inclined, Though somewhat dash'd with shades of darker hue, To truth and kindly deeds. But from this mixed seed of good and ill One baleful plant in dark strength rais'd its head, O'ertopping all the rest; which fav'ring circumstance Did feed and strengthen to a growth so monstrous, That underneath its wide and noxious shade Died all the native plants of feebler stem. O I have wept for him, as I have lain On my still midnight couch! I tried to save him, But ev'ry means against its end recoil'd. Good Selred, thou rememb'rest well that night When to the female Druid's awful cave I led thy brother. Sel. I remember well. All the Thanes (speaking at once, eagerly.) Ay, what of that? We've heard strange tales of it. Eth. At my request the Arch Sister there receiv'd him: And though she promis'd me she would unfold Such things as might a bold ambitious mind Scare from its wishes, she, unweetingly, Did but the more inflame them. Her. Ha! what sayst thou? Did she not show the form of things to come By fix'd decrees, unsubject to her will? Eth. She show'd him things, indeed, most wonderful; Whether by human arts to us unknown, Or magic, or the aid of powerful spirits Call'd forth, I wot not. Hark! I hear a noise. 1st Th. I hear without the tread of many feet. They pull our dungeon's bars: ha, see who come! Wear they not ruffians brows? 2d Th. And follow'd still by more: a num'rous crew. What is their business here? [Enter a band of armed men, accompanied by two priests, and carrying with them a block, an axe, and a large sheet or curtain, &amp;c. Eth. Do not the axe and block borne by those slaves Tell thee their errand? But we'll face them bravely. They do not come upon us unawares: We are prepar'd.âLet us take hands, my friends! Let us united stand, a worthy band Of girded trav'llers, ready to depart Unto a land unknown, but yet undreaded. [They all take hands, facing about, and waiting the approach of the men with a steady countenance. 1st priest. Why look you on us thus with lowering brows? Can linked hands the keen-edg'd steel resist? Her. No, priest, but linked hearts can bid defiance To the barb'd lightning, if so arm'd withal Thou didst encounter us. Quick do thine office! Here six brave heads abide thee, who ne'er yet Have meanly bow'd themselves to living wight. 1st priest. You are too forward, youth: less will suffice: One of those guilty heads beneath our axe Must fall, the rest shall live. So wills our chief. Lots shall decide our victim: in this urn Inclosed are your fates. [Setting down an urn in the middle of the stage upon a small tripod or stand, whilst the chiefs instantly let go hands, and stand gazing upon one another. Ha! have I then so suddenly unlink'd you? [With a malicious smile. Put forth your hands, brave chiefs; put forth your hands; And he who draws the sable lot of death, Full speedy be his doom! [A long pause: the chiefs still look upon one another, none of them offering to step forward to the urn. What pause ye thus, indeed? This hateful urn Doth but one death contain, and many lives, And shrink ye from it, brave and valiant Thanes? Then lots shall first be cast, who foremost shall Thrust in his hand into this vase of terrors. Eth. (stepping forth). No, thou rude servant of a gentle master, Doing disgrace to thy much honour'd garb, This shall not be: I am the eldest chief, And I of right should stand the foremost here. [Putting his hand into the urn What heaven appoints me, welcome! Sel. (putting in his hand). I am the next: heav'n send me what it lists! 1st Th. (putting in his hand). Here also let me take. If that the race Of noble Cormac shall be sunk in night, How small a thing determines! 2d Th. (putting in his hand). On which shall fix my grasp? (hesitating) or this? or this? No, cursed thing! whate'er thou art, I'll have thee. 3d Th. (putting out his hand with purturbation, misses the narrow mouth of the urn). I wist not how it is: where is its mouth? 1st priest. Direct thy hand more steadily, good Thane, And fear not thou wilt miss it. (To Hereulf.) Now, youthful chief, one lot remains for thee. [Hereulf pauses for a moment, and his countenance betrays perturbation, when Ethelbert steps forth again. Eth. No, this young chieftain's lot belongs to me; He shall not draw. [Putting in his hand quickly and taking out the last lot. Now, priest, the lots are finish'd. 1st priest. Well, open then your fates. [They each open their lots, whilst Hereulf stands looking eagerly in their faces as they open them. 2d Th. (opening his, and then holding up his hands in ecstasy). Wife, children, home! I am a living man! 1st Th. (having opened his). I number still with those who breathe the air, And look upon the light! blest heaven so wills it. 3d Th. (looking at his joyfully). Fate is with me! the race of Cormac lives! Her. (after looking anxiously first upon Ethelbert and then upon Selred). Selred, what is thy lot? is it not dark? Sel. No, Hereulf. Her. Oh, Ethelbert! thou smilest on me! alas! It is a dismal smile! thou art the victim! Thou shalt not die: the lot of right is mine. A shade of human weakness cross'd my soul, Such as before, not in the horrid fields Of crimson slaughter did I ever feel; But it is past; now I can bravely die, And I will have my right. Eth. (pushing him affectionately away). Away, my son! It is as it should be. Her. O if thou wilt entreat me as a man, Nor slur me with contempt! I do beseech thee Upon my bended knee! (Kneeling.) O if thou diest, I of all living things most wretched am! Eth. Be temperate, my son! thou art reserv'd For what the fervid strength of active youth Can best perform. O take him from me, friends! [The Thanes take Hereulf forcibly from clinging round Ethelbert, and he then assumes a softened solemnity. Now, my brave friends, we have together fought A noble warfare; I am call'd away! Let me in kind and true affection leave you. Thanes (speaking together). Alas, thou art our father and our friend! Alas, that thou shouldst meet this dismal end! Eth. Ay, true indeed, it is a dismal end To mortal feeling; yet within my breast Blest hope and love, and heav'nward confidence, With human frailty so combined are, That I do feel a wild and trembling pleasure. E'en on this awful verge, methinks I go, Like a chid infant, from his passing term Of short disgrace, back to his father's presence. [Holding up his hands with a dignified exultation. I feel an awful joy!âFarewell, my friends! Selred, we've fought in many a field together, And still as brothers been; take thou, I pray, This token of my love. And thou, good Wolfere, I've ever priz'd thy worth, wear thou this ring. (To the two other chiefs, giving them also tokens.) And you, brave chiefs, I've ever loved you both. And now, my noble Hereulf, Of all the youth to whom my soul e'er knit, As with a parent's love, in the good cause, Thee have I found most fervent and most firm; Be thine my sword, which in my native hall Hung o'er my noble father's arms thou'lt find, And be it in thy hands what well thou knowst It would have been in mine. Farewell, my friends! God bless you all! [They all crowd about him, some kissing his hands, some taking hold of his clothes, except Hereulf, who, starting away from him, throws himself upon the ground in an agony of grief. Ethelbert lifts up his eyes and his hands as if he were uttering a blessing over them. 1st priest. This may not be! down with those impious hands! Dar'st thou, foul heretic, before the face Of hallow'd men, thus mutter prayers accurst? Eth. Doth this offend you?âO it makes me feel A spirit for this awful hour unmeet, When I do think on you, ye hypocrites! 1st priest. Come, come! we waste our time, the headsman waits. (To Eth.) Prepare thee for the block. Eth. And will you in the sight of these my friends Your bloody task perform? Let them retire. 1st priest. Nay, nay, that may not be, our pious Hexulf Has given his orders. 2d priest. O be not so cruel! Though he has ordered so, yet, ne'ertheless, We may suspend this veil, and from their eyes The horrid sight conceal. 1st priest. Then be it so; I grant it. [A large cloth or curtain is suspended upon the points of two spears, held up by spearmen, concealing the block and executioner, &amp;c. from the Thanes. 1st priest (to the men behind the curtain, after a pause). Are ye ready? (Voices behind.) Yes, we are ready now. 1st priest (To Eth.). And thou? Eth. God be my strength! I'm ready also. [As the priest is leading Ethelbert behind the curtain, he turns about to give a last look to his friends; and they, laying their hands devoutly upon their breasts, bow to him very low. They then go behind the curtain, leaving the Thanes on the front of the stage, who stand fixed in silent and horrid expectation; except Selred, who sits down upon the ground with his face hid between his knees, and Hereulf, who, rising suddenly from the ground, looks wildly round, and seeing Ethelbert gone, throws himself down again in all the distraction of grief and despair.A voice behind (after some noise and bustle of preparation has been heard). Now doff his garment, and undo his vest. Fie on it, there! assist the prisoner. 2d voice. Let some one hold his hands. 3d voice. Do ye that office. [A pause of some length.Voice again. Headsman, let fall thy blow, he gives the sign. [The axe is seen lifted up above the curtain, and the sound of the stroke is heard. Thanes (shrinking involuntarily. and all speaking at once). The stroke of death is given! [The spearmen let fall the curtain, and the body of Ethelbert is discovered upon the ground, with a cloth over it; whilst his head is held up by the executioner, but seen very indistinctly through the spears and pikes of the surrounding soldiers. The Thanes start back and avert their faces. 1st priest. (coming forward). Rebellious Thanes, ye see a deed of justice. Here rest ye, and another day of life Enjoy together: at this hour to-morrow We'll visit you, and then, by lot determin'd, Another head must fall. So wills the king. 1st Th. What words are these? 2d Th. Do thine ears catch their sense? 3d Th. I cannot tell thee; mine confus'dly sound. 1st priest (raising his voice louder). To-morrow at this hour we'll visit you. And here again, selected by the lot, Another head must fall. Till then, farewell! Another day of life enjoy securely: Much happiness be with you. [An involuntary groan bursts from the Thanes, and Hereulf, starting furiously from the ground, clenches his hands in a menacing posture as the priests and spearmen, &amp;c. retire. The scene closes. Should this play ever have the honour of being represented upon any stage, a scene of this kind, in which so many inferior actors would be put into situations requiring the expression of strong passion, might be a disadvantage to it; I should, therefore, recommend having the front of the stage on which the Thanes are, during the last part of the scene, thrown into deep shade, and the light only to come across the background at the bottom of the stage: this would give to the whole a greater solemnity; and by this means no expression of countenance, but only that of gesture, would be required of them. ACT V SCENE I. An open space on the walls of the castle. Enter Alwy and Hexulf, talking as they enter with violent gesture. Hex. Escap'd, sayst thou, with all the rebel chiefs? Hereulf escap'd? th' arch fiend himself hath done it, If what thou sayst be true.âIt is impossible. Sayst thou they are escap'd? Alwy. In very truth they are. Hex. Then damned treachery has aided them! Alwy. Nay, rather say, thy artful cruelty Arm'd them with that which to the weakly frame Lends a nerved giant's strength, despair. From out The thick and massy wall, now somewhat loose And jagged grown with time, cemented heaps, Which scarce two teams of oxen could have mov'd, They've torn, and found a passage to the moat. What did it signify in what dire form Death frown'd upon them, so as they had died? Hex. Who can foresee events? As well as thou I would that one swift stroke had slain them all Rather than this had been. But Ethelbert And Selred are secur'd. Was it not Selred Who on the second night our victim fell? Alwy. It was, but better had it been for us Had they been left alive: had they been still In their own castles unmolested left. For like a wounded serpent, who, aloft, The surgy volumes of his mangled length In agony the more terrific rears Against his enemy, this maimed compact Will from thy stroke but the more fiercely rise, Now fiery Hereulf is their daring leader. And what have we to look for? Hex. Dire, bloody vengeance.âO some damned traitor Hath done this work! it could not else have been! Alwy. Well, do thou find him out then, if thou canst, And let thy vengeance fall where lies the sin. Hex. Doth the king know of this? Alwy. He doth not yet. Hex. Then must he be inform'd without delay. Alwy. As quickly as you please, if that you please To take that office on yourself, good father; But as for me, I must right plainly say I will not venture it: no, faith! of late The frame and temper of King Ethwald's mind Is chang'd. He ever was in former times Cheerful, collected, sanguine; for all turns Of fate prepar'd, like a fair ample lake, Whose breast receives the azure hue of heaven, And sparkles gaily in the breezy noon: But now, like a swoln flood, whose course has been O'er rude opposing rocks and rugged shelves; Whose turbid waters wear the sullen shade Of dark o'erhanging banks, and all enchaf'd Round ev'ry little pebble fiercely roars, Boiling in foamy circles, his chaf'd spirit Can bear th' encounter of no adverse thing To his stern will oppos'd. I may not tell him. Hex. Be not so fearful! art thou not a man Us'd to the sudden turns of great men's humours? Thou best can do it, Alwy. (Soothingly.) Alwy. Nay, father, better will it suit your age And rev'rend state. And he has need, I ween, Of ghostly counsel too; night after night He rises from his tossing sleepless couch, Oft wildly staring round the vacant chamber, As if his fancy peopled the dark void With horrid shapes. The queen hath told me this. Come, look to it, for something must be done. Hex. I will accompany your homeward steps, Whilst we consider of it. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A royal apartment, and a servant discovered busily employed in lighting it up. Enter to him another servant. 2d serv. Wilt thou ne'er finish lighting these grim walls? Will not those lamps suffice? 1st serv. No, by my faith, we want as many more; For still, thou seest, that pillar'd corner's dark, [Pointing to a gloomy recess on the other side of the stage. Wherein the eye of conscience-scared folks Might fearful things espy. I am commanded To lighten each apartment of this tower To noon-day pitch. 2d serv. Ay, Uthbert, these are fearful, bloody times! Ethwald, God knows, has on his conscience laid A weight of cruel deeds: the executioner Works for him now in the grim holds of death, Instead of armed warriors in the field; And now men steal abroad in twilight's gloom, To talk of fearful things, not by the blaze Of cheerful fires, in peaceful cottage, heap'd With sparkling faggots from the winter store. 1st serv. Ay, thou sayst well; it is a fearful time; No marvel Ethwald should not love the dark In which his fancy shapes all fearful things. 2d serv. What, dost thou think it is his fancy's shapes He looks upon? No, no: believe me, friend, Night and the darkness are inhabited By those who move near neighbours to the living; Close by their very sides, yet unperceiv'd By all, but those whose eyes unveiled are By heavenly power, in mercy or in wrath. Such proofs of this I've heard.âLast night thou knowst The royal grooms who near their master sleep, In the adjoining chamber much were scar'd With fearful sounds. 1st serv. I know it not.âWho was it told it thee? At midnight was it? (Eagerly.) 2d serv. Yes, come with me to Baldwick, he will tell thee; He heard it all: thou wilt return in time To finish, here, thy task. We'll have a horn Of foaming ale, and thou shalt hear it all. Good foaming ale: ay, mercy on us all' We live in fearful times! (Listening.) 1st serv. (listening also). What shall I do? I hear the king a speaking angrily, And coming hitherward. What shall I do? Shall I remain and face him? nay, good faith! I'll shun the storm; he is engag'd, perchance, Too much to notice my unfinish'd task. [Exeunt hastily. Enter Ethwald, talking angrily to a noble Thane. Ethw. Nay, nay, these are excuses, noble Edmar, Not reasons; all our northern troops ere now Might well have been in readiness. 'Tis plain Such backward sloth from disaffection springs. Look to it well:âif with the waning moon, He and his vassals have not join'd our standard, I'll hold him as a traitor. Th. My royal lord, be not so wrathful with him, Nor let your noble mind to dark suspicion So quickly yield. This is the season still, When unbraced warriors on the rushy floor Stretch them in pleasing sloth; list'ning to tales Of ancient crones, or merry harpers' lays, And batt'ning on the housewife's gusty cheer: Spring has not yet so temper'd the chill sky That men will change their warm and shelt'ring roofs For its cold canopy. Ethw. O foul befall their gluttony and sloth! Fie on't! there is no season to the brave For war unfit. With this moon's waning light I will, with those who dare their king to follow, My northern march begin. Th. Then, faith, my lord, I much suspect your army will be small: And what advantage may you well expect From all this haste? E'en three weeks later, still You will surprise the foe, but ill prepar'd To oppose invasion. Do then, gracious king, Listen to friendly counsel, and the while, Within these walls, where ev'ry pleasure courts you, Like a magnificent and royal king, Your princely home enjoy. Ethw. Out on it, man, thou knowst not what thou sayst! Home hath he none who once becomes a king! Behind the pillar'd masses of his halls The dagger'd traitor lurks; his vaulted roofs Do nightly echo to the whisper'd vows Of those who curse him; at his costly board With grinning smile the damned pois'ner sits; Yea, e'en the void recesses of his chamber, Void though they be unto all eyes but his, Are peopledâ [Stopping short. Th. (eagerly). Good my lord! what do you mean? Ethw. In the confusion of tumultuous war, 'Midst the terrific shouts of closing foes, And trampling steeds, and din of bick'ring arms; Where dying warriors groan unheard, and things Horrid to nature are as though they were not, Unwail'd, unheeded: Where the rough chance of each contentious day Blots out all irksome mem'ry of the past, All fear of that to follow: where like herds, Of savage beasts, on the bleak mountain's side, Drench'd with the rain, the weary warriors lie, Whilst nightly tempests howling o'er their heads Lull them to rest; there is my home, good Thane. Th. No marvel, then, my lord, if to the field You turn your eager thoughts! I only fear Your royal arms will in Northumberland Find no contention worthy of their force; For rumour says, the northern prince is gone With his best troops against the Scottish king. Ethw. If this be true, it is unto my fortune Most fair occasion; master of the north I soon shall be, and on the west again Pour like a torrent big with gather'd strength. Who told thee this? it breaks upon me, friend, Like bright'ning sunbeams thwart a low'ring sky. Th. A northern villain brought to me the tale, And told with circumstances of good credit. Ethw. Run thou and find him out; I'll wait thee here; I must have more assurance of this matter. Quickly, my worthy Edmar! [Exit Thane. (Alone.) If that this rumour bear a true report, Th' opposing rocks on which my rising tide So long has beat, before me now give way, And through the beach my onward waves shall roll To the wide limits of their destin'd reach. Full day, although tempestuous it may prove, Now breaks on me! now come the glorious height, And the proud front, and the full grasp of power! Fly, gloomy thoughts, and hideous fantasies, Back to the sprites that sent you! England's king Behind him casts the fears of Mercia's lord. The north subdued, then stretching to the west My growing strengthâ [Stretching out his arms in the vehemence of action, he turns himself round, directly facing the gloomy recess on the opposite side of the stage. Ha! doth some gloomy void still yawn before me, In fearful shade? [Turning his eyes away hastily from it. No; I saw nothing: shall I thus be moved With ev'ry murky nook? I'll look again. [Steals a fearful look to the recess, and then starting back, turns away from it with horror. O they're all there again! and ev'ry phantom Mark'd with its grisly wounds, e'en as before. Ho! who waits there? Hugon! I say, ho, Hugon! Come to me! quickly come! Enter a Groom of his chamber. Groom. Save you, my royal lord! What is your pleasure? Are you in pain? Your voice did sound, methought, With strange unnatural strength. Ethw. Bring me lights here. Groom. A hundred lamps would scarce suffice, I ween, To light this spacious chamber. Ethw. Then let a thousand do it; must I still In ev'ry shady corner of my house See hideousâquickly go, and do my bidding. Why star'st thou round thee thus? Dost thou see aught? Groom. No, nothing. [Looking round fearfully. Ethw. Thou needst not look; 'tis nothing; fancy oft Deceives the eye with strange and flitting things. Regard it not, but quickly bring more lamps Groom. Nay, good my lord, shall I remain with you, And call my fellow? Ethw. (angrily). Do as thou art commanded. [Exit groom. This man perceives the weakness of my mind. Am I, indeed, the warlike king of Mercia? [Re-enter two grooms with lamps, which they place in the recess. Ethwald, not venturing to look on it again till the lights are placed, now turns round to it, and seems relieved. Ye have done well. [After a pause, in which he walks several times across the stage, stopping short, and seeing the grooms still there. Why do ye linger here? I want ye not. Begone. [Exeunt grooms. But that I would not to those fools Betray the shameful secret of my mind, I fain would call them back. What are these horrors? A fearful visitation of a time That will o'erpass? O might I so believe it! Edmar, methinks, ere this might be return'd: I'll wait for him no more: I'll go myself And meet him. [Going towards the large arched door by which he entered, he starts back from it with horror. Ha! they are there again! E'en in the very door-way do they front me! Still foremost Ethelbert and Selred tower With their new-sever'd necks, and fix on me Their death-strain'd eye-balls: and behind them frowns The murder'd youth, and Oswal's scepter'd ghost: While seen, as if half-fading into air, The pale distracted maid shows her faint form. Thrice in this very form and order seen They have before me stood. What may it mean? I've heard that shapes like these will to the utterance Of human voice give back articulate sound, And having been adjured so, depart. [Stretching out both his hands, and clenching them resolutely. I'll do it, though behind them hell should yawn, With all its unveil'd horrors. [Turning again to the doorway with awful solemnity. If aught ye be but flitting fantasies, But empty semblance of the form ye wear; If aught ye be that can to human voice Real audience give, and a real sense receive Of that on which your fix'd and hollow eyes So stern and fix'dly glare; I do conjure you Depart from me, and come again no more! From me depart! Full well those ghastly wounds Have been return'd into this tortur'd breast: O drive me not unto the horrid brink Of dire distraction! Speak, Ethelbert! O speak, if voice thou hast! Tell me what sacrifice can soothe your spirits; Can still the unquiet sleepers of the grave: For this most horrid visitation is Beyond endurance of the boldest mind, In flesh and blood enrob'd.âIt takes no heed, But fix'dly glares upon me as before. I speak to empty air: it can be nothing. Is it not some delusion of the eyes? [Rubbing his eyes very hard, and rousing himself. Ah! still the hideous semblance is before me, Plain as at first. I cannot suffer this! [Runs to the lamps, and taking one in each hand, rushes forward in despair to the doorway. They are all gone! Before the searching light Resolv'd to nothing! Enter Hexulf and Alwy. Ethw. (turning hastily upon hearing them enter behind him). Ha! is it you? Most happily you come! Welcome you are, most welcome! Alwy. Thanks to you, good my lord! but on my life This holy bishop and myself are come, Unwillingly, with most untoward tidings. Ethw. Well, use not many words: what now befalls? Hex. The rebel Hereulf and his thralled mates Have, with more strength than human hands may own, For that the holy churchâ Ethw. Well, well, what meanest thou? And what should follow this? Alwy. They've brok'n their prison walls and are escap'd. Ethw. I am glad on't! be it so! in faith I'm glad! We have shed blood enough. Alwy. Nay, but my lord, unto their towers of strength They will return; where bruiting abroad Their piteous tale, as 'nighted travellers To the false plainings of some water fiend, All men will turn to them; nor can your troops In safety now begin their northern march With such fell foes behind them. Ethw. (roused). Ay, thou sayst true; it is a damned let! Here falls another rock to bar my way. But I will on! Come, let us instantly Set out, and foil them ere they gather strength. Alwy. This would be well, but that within these walls Some of their faithful friends are still confin'd, Who in our absence might disturbance breed, As but a feeble guard can now be spar'd To hold the castle. How shall this be settled? Shall we confine them in the stronger vaults? Ethw. (fiercely). No, no! I'll have no more imprisonments! Let them be slain; yea all: even to a man! This is no time for weak uncertain deeds. Saw you not Edmar as you hither came? Alwy. We saw him with a stranger much engaged, By a faint lamp, near to the eastern tower. Ethw. Then follow me, and let us find him out. Hex. We follow you, my lord. Ethw. (as he is about to go out, turning hastily round to Alwy). Bear thou a light. My house is like a faintly mooned cave, And hateful shadows cross each murky aisle. [Exeunt, Alwy bearing a light. SCENE III. The evening: a wood with a view of Ethwald's castle seen through the trees. Enter Hereulf disguised like a country hind: enter to him, by another path, a Thane, disguised also. Her. Welcome, my friend! art thou the first to join me? This as I guess should be th' appointed time: For o'er our heads have passed on homeward wing Dark flights of rooks and daws and flocking birds, Wheeling aloft with wild dissonant screams; And from each hollow glen and river's bed The white mist slowly steals in fleecy wreaths Up the dark wooded banks. And yet, methinks, The deeper shades of ev'ning come not after, As they are wont, but day is lengthen'd out Most strangely. Th. Seest thou those paly streams of shiv'ring light So widely spread along the northern sky? They to the twilight grey that brightness lend At which thou wonderest. Look up, I pray thee! Her. (turning and looking up). What may it mean? it is a beauteous light. Th. In truth I know not. Many a time have I On hill and heath beheld the changeful face Of awful night; I've seen the moving stars Shoot rapidly athwart the sombre sky, Red fiery meteors in the welkin blaze, And sheeted lightnings gleam, but ne'er before Saw I a sight like this. It is, belike, Some sign portentous of our coming fate: Had we not better pause and con awhile This daring scene, ere yet it be too late? Her. No, by this brave man's sword! not for an hour Will I the glorious vengeful deed delay, Though heav'n's high dome were flaming o'er my head, And earth beneath me shook. If it be aught Portentous, it must come from higher powers: For demons ride but on the lower clouds, Or raise their whirlwinds in the nether air. All blessed spirits still must favour those Who war on virtue's side: therefore, I say, Let us march boldly to the glorious work: It is a sign foretelling Ethwald's fall. Now for our valiant friends; they must be near. Ho! holla, ho! [Enter by different paths in the wood, the other chiefs, disguised, and gather round Hereulf, he receiving them joyfully. Welcome! all welcome! you good Thane, and you, And ev'ry valiant soul, together leagued In this bold enterprise. Well are we met. So far we prosper; and my glowing heart Tells me our daring shall be nobly crown'd. Now move we cheerly on our way: behold Those frowning towers, where, ere the morning watch, That shall be done, for which, e'en in our graves, Full many a gen'rous Mercian, yet unborn, Shall bless our honour'd names. Chiefs (speaking all together). We follow you, brave Hereulf. 1st chief. Ay, with true heart, or good or ill betide, We'll follow you. Her. Come on! ere this, with fifty chosen men, Our trusty colleague, near the northern gate, Attends our signal. Come, ye gen'rous few; Ye who have groan'd in the foul dungeon's gloom, Whose gen'rous bosoms have indignant heav'd To see free men beneath th' oppressor's yoke Like base-born villains press'd! Now comes the hour Of virtuous vengeance: on our side in secret Beats ev'ry Mercian heart: the tyrant now Trusts not to men: nightly within his chamber The watch-dog guards his couch, the only friend He now dare trust, but shall not guard it long. Follow my steps, and do the gen'rous deeds Of valiant freemen: heaven is on our side. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An open space within the walls of the castle, fronting one of the gates: the stage darkened, and the sky lighted up with the aurora borealis, very bright. Enter by opposite sides two Officers of the castle. 1st off. Ha! is it thou, my friend? Thou'st left thy post, I guess, as well as I, To view this awful sky. Look over head, Where like a mighty dome, from whose bright centre Shoot forth those quiv'ring rays of vivid light, Moving with rapid change on every side, Swifter than flitting thought, the heavens appear! While o'er the west in paler brightness gleam Full many a widely undulating tide Of silver light: and the dark low'ring east, Like to a bloody mantle stretched out, Seems to conceal behind its awful shade Some dread commotion of the heavenly powers, Soon to break forthâsome grand and unknown thing. 2d off. It is an awful sight! what may it mean? Doth it not woes and bloody strife foretell? I've heard my father talk of things like this.â When the king's passing sickness shall be gone, Which has detain'd him from his purpos'd march Against the rebel chiefs, doubt not, my friend, We shall have bloody work. 1st off. Ay, but ere that, mayhap, the man of blood May bleed; and Mercia from the tyrant's graspâ 2d off. Hush, hush! thou art unwise: some list'ning earâ 1st off. And if there should, what danger? all men now Harbour such secret thoughts; and those who once His youthful valour lov'd and warlike feats, Now loathe his cruelty. I'll tell thee somethingâ [Drawing nearer him mysteriously. 2d off. (frightened). Hush, hush! I will not hear thee! hold thy tongue! What will't avail, when on the bloody stake Thy head is fix'd, that all men think as thou dost: And he who fix'd thy cruel doom to-day Shall die to-morrow? 1st off. I'm mute, my friend: and now I plainly see How he may lord it o'er a prostrate land, Who trembles in his iron tower the while, With but a surly mastiff for his friend. 2d off. Nay, do not speak so loud. What men are these Who pass the gate just now? shall we not stop them? [Enter some of the leagued chiefs in disguise through the gate. 1st off. No, do not trouble them. They are, I guess, Some 'nighted rustics frighten'd with the sky, Who seek the shelter of man's habitation. In such an awful hour men crowd together, As gath'ring sea-fowl flock before a storm. With such a welkin blazing o'er our heads, Shall men each other vex? e'en let them pass. [Enter a crowd of frightened women and children. 2d off. See what a crowd of women this way come, With crying children clinging to their knees, And infants in their arms! How now, good matrons? Where do you run? 1st wom. O do not stop us! to St. Alban's shrine We run: there will we kneel, and lift our hands, For that his holy goodness may protect us In this most awful hour. 2d wom. On, sisters, on! The fiery welkin rages o'er our heads, And we are sinful souls: O quickly move! [Exeunt women and children. 2d off. I also am, alack! a sinful soul: I'll follow them and pray for mercy too. 1st off. I'll to the northern wall, from whence the heavens In full expanse are seen. [Exeunt severally. SCENE V. Ethwald's apartment: he is discovered sitting by his couch, with his elbows resting upon his knees, and supporting his head between both his hands; the Queen standing by him. Queen. Why sit you thus, my lord? it is not well: It wears your strength: I pray you go to rest. [A pause, and he makes no answer. These nightly watchings much retard your cure; Be then advis'd! [A pause, and he still takes no notice. Why are you thus unwilling? The tower is barr'd, and all things are secure. Ethw. How goes the hour? is it the second watch? Queen. No, near the window now, I heard the guard Exchange the word: the first is but half spent. Ethw. And does the fearful night still lie before me In all its hideous length? (Rising up with emotion.) O ye successive terms of gloomy quiet! Over my mind ye pass like rolling waves Of dense oppression; while deep underneath Lie all its noble powers and faculties O'erwhelmed. If such dark shades must henceforth cross My chequer'd life with still returning horrors, O let me rest in the foul reptile's hole, And take from me the being of a man! Queen. Too much thou givest way to racking thought: Take this: it is a draught by cunning skill Compounded curiously, and strongly charm'd; With secret virtue fill'dâit soothes the mind, And gives the body rest. [Offering him a cup. Ethw. Sayst thou? then in good sooth I need it much. I thank thee too; thou art a careful wife. [Takes the cup, and as he is about to put it to his lips, stops short and looks suspiciously at her. It has, methinks, a strange unkindly smell. Taste it thyself; dost thou not take my meaning? Do thou first drink of it. Queen. I am in health, my lord, and need it not. Ethw. By the dread powers of darkness, thou shalt drink it! Ay, to the very dregs! Queen. What, would you cast on me such vile suspicions, And treat a royal princess like your slave? Ethw. And so thou art. Thou rearst thy stately neck, And while I list, thou flarest in men's eyes A gorgeous queen; but unto me thou artâ I do command thee, drink it to the dregs. Queen (subdued, and lifting the cup to her lips). Then be convinced how wrongful are thy thoughts. Ethw. (preventing her). Forbear, I am too slightly mov'd to anger. I should have known the being of thy state Is all too closely with my fortune link'd. Give me the cup. Thou sayst it soothes the mind? If I indeed could rest-(Tastes it). It tastes not well; It is a bitter drug. Queen. Then give it me again; I'll hie to Dwina, And get from her that which shall make it sweet. [She walks to the door of another apartment, but as she is about to go out, Ethwald hurries after her, and catches her by the arm. Ethw. Thou shalt not go and leave me thus alone. Queen. I'll soon return again, and all around thee Is light as noon-day. Ethw. Nay, nay, good wife, it rises now before me In the full blaze of light. Queen. Ah! what meanst thou? Ethw. The faint and shadowy forms, That in obscurity were wont to rise In sad array, are with the darkness fled. But what avails the light? for now since sickness Has press'd upon my soul, in my lone moments, E'en in the full light of my torch-clad walls, A horrid spectre rises to my sight, Close by my side, and plain and palpable, In all good seeming and close circumstance, As man meets man. Queen. Merey upon us! what form does it wear? Ethw. My murder'd brother's form. He stands close by my side; his ghastly head Shakes horridly upon its sever'd neck As if new from the headsman's stroke; it moves Still as I move; and when I look upon it, It looksâNo, no! I can no utterance find To tell thee how it looks on me again. Queen. Yet, fear not now: I shall not long be absent; And thou mayst hear my footsteps all the while, It is so short a space. [Exit Queen. Ethw. (returning to the middle of the stage). I'll fix my steadfast eyes upon the ground, And turn to other things my tutor'd thoughts Intently. (After pausing for a little while, with his clenched hands crossed upon his breast, and his eyes fixed upon the ground.) It may not be; I feel upon my mind The horrid sense that preludes still its coming. Elburga! ho, Elburga! (Putting his hand before his eyes, and calling out with a strong voice of fear.) Enter Queen in haste. Queen. Has't come again? Ethw. No; but I felt upon my pausing soul The sure and horrid sense of its approach. Hadst thou not quickly come, it had ere now Been frowning by my side. The cup, the cup! [Drinks eagerly. Queen. Heaven grant thee peace! Wilt thou not send unto the holy priest, To give thee ghostly comfort? Ethw. (shaking his head). Away, away! to thee and to thy priests I have, alas! lent too much heed already. Queen. Let not your noble spirit thus be shent! Still bear good heart! these charmed drugs full soon Will make you strong and vig'rous as before; And in the rough sport of your northern war, You will forget these dreadful fantasies. Ethw. Ay, thou speakst wisely now: methinks I still, In the embattled field, 'midst circling hosts, Could do the high deeds of a warlike king; And what a glorious field now opens to me! But, oh! this cursed bar; this ill-timed sickness; It keeps me back ev'n like a bitted steed. But it was ever thus! What have avail'd My crimes, and cares, and blood, and iron toil? Queen. What have avail'd! art thou not king of Mercia? Ethw. Ay, ay, Elburga! 'tis enough for thee To tower in senseless state and be a queen; But to th' expanded and aspiring soul, To be but still the thing it long has been Is misery, e'en though enthron'd it were Under the cope of high imperial state. O cursed hind'rance! blasting fiends breathe on me. Putst thou not something in thy damned drugs That doth retard my cure? I might ere this With cased limbs have stridden the clanging field, And been myself again.âHark! some one comes. [Listening with alarm. Queen. Be not disturb'd, it is your faithful groom. Who brings the watch-dog; all things are secure. Ethw. Nay, but I heard the sound of other feet. [Running to the door, and pushing in a great bar. Say, who art thou without? Voice without. Your groom, my lord, who brings your faithful dog. Ethw. (to Queen). Didst thou not hear the sound of other feet? Queen. No, only his; your mind is too suspicious. Ethw. I in his countenance have mark'd of late That which I liked not: were this dreary night But once o'ermaster'd, he shall watch no more. [Opens the door suspiciously, and enters an armed man leading in a great watch-dog: the door is shut again hastily and the bar is replaced. (To the dog.) Come, rough and surly friend! Thou only dost remain on whom my mind Can surely trust. I'll have more dogs so train'd. [Looking steadfastly at the groom. Thy face is pale: thou hast a haggard look: Where hast thou been? [Seizing him by the neck. Answer me quickly! Say, where hast thou been? Gr. Looking upon the broad and fearful sky. Queen. What sayst thou? Gr. The heaven's are all a flaming o'er our heads, And fiery spears are shiv'ring through the air. Ethw. Hast thou seen this? Gr. Ay, by our holy saint! Queen. It is some prodigy, dark and portentous. Gr. A red and bloody mantle seems outstretch'd O'er the wide welkin, andâ Ethw. Peace, damned fool! Tell me no more: be to thy post withdrawn. [Exit groom by a small side-door, leading the dog with him. Ethw. (to himself, after musing for some time). Heaven warring o'er my head! there is in this Some fearful thing betoken'd. If that, in truth, the awful term is come, The fearful bound'ry of my mortal reach, O'er which I must into those regions pass Of horror and despair, to take my place With those who do their blood-earn'd crowns exchange For ruddy circles of devouring fire: Where hopeless woe and gnashing agony Writhe in the dens of torment; where things be Yet never imaged in the thoughts of man, Dark, horrible, unknownâ I'll mantle o'er my head, and think no more. [Covers his head with his cloak, and sinks down upon the couch. Queen. Nay, rather stretch you on the fleecy bed. Ethw. Rest, if thou canst, I do not hinder thee. Queen. Then truly I will lean my head awhile. I am o'erspent and weary. [Leans on the couch. Ethw. (hastily uncovering his face). Thou must not sleep: watch with meand be silent: It is an awful hour! [A long pause; then Ethwald starting up from the couch with alarm. I hear strange sounds ascend the winding stairs. Queen. I hear them too. Ethw. Ha! dost thou also hear it? Then it is real. (Listening.) I hear the clash of arms. Ho, guard! come forth. Re-enter Groom. Go, rouse my faithful dog: Dark treason is upon us. Gr. (disappears and then re-entering). He sleeps so sound, my lord, I cannot rouse him. Ethw. Then, villain, I'm betray'd! thou hast betray'd me! But set thy brawny strength against that door, And bar them out: if thou but seemst to flinch, This sword is in thy heart. [A noise of armed men is now heard at the door endeavouring to break it open, whilst Ethwald and the groom set their shoulders to it to prevent them. Enter Dwina hastily from an inner apartment, and with the Queen assists in putting their strength also to the door, as the force without increases. The door is at last broken open, and Hereulf, with the rebel chiefs, burst in sword in hand. Her. (to Ethwald). Now, thou fell ruthless lion, that hast made With bloody rage thy native forest waste! The spearmen are upon thee! to the strife Turn thy rough breast: thou canst no more escape. Ethw. Quick to thy villain's work, thou wordy coward, Who in the sick man's chamber seekst the fame Thou dar'st not in th' embattled field attain! I am prepar'd to front thee and thy mates, Were ye twice numbered o'er. [Sets his back to a pillar, and puts himself into a posture of defence. Her. The sick man's chamber! darest thou, indeed, Begrimed as thou art with blood and crimes 'Gainst man committed, human rights assume? Thou art a hideous and envenom'd snake, Whose wounded length even in his noisome hole, Men fiercely hunt, for love of human kind; And wert thou scotch'd to the last ring of life, E'en that poor remnant of thy curs'd existence Should be trod out in the dust. Ethw. Come on, thou boasting fool! give thy sword work, And spare thy cursed tongue. Her. Ay, surely will I! It is the sword of noble Ethelbert: Its master's blood weighs down its heavy strokes; His unseen hand directs them. [They fight: Ethwald defends himself furiously, but at last falls, and the conspirators raise a loud shout. 1st ch. Bless heaven, the work is done! 2d ch. Now Mercia is reveng'd, and free-born men May rest their toil'd limbs in their peaceful homes. 3d ch. (going nearer the body). Ha! does he groan? 2d ch. No, he dies sullenly, and to the wall Turns his writh'd form and death-distorted visage. [A solemn pause, whilst Ethwald, after some convulsive motions, expires. Her. Now hath his loaded soul gone to its place, And ne'er a pitying voice from all his kind Cries, âGod have merey on him!â 3d ch. I've vow'd to dip my weapon in his blood. st ch. And so have I. [Several of them advancing with their swords towards the body, a young man steps forth, and stretches out his arm to keep them off. Young man. My father in the British wars was seiz'd A British prisoner, and with all he had Unto a Mercian chief by lot consign'd; Mine aged grandsire, lowly at his feet, Rent his grey hair; Ethwald, a youthful warrior, Receiv'd the old man's pray'r and set him free; Yea, even to the last heifer of his herds Restor'd his wealth. For this good deed, do not insult the fallen. He was not ruthless once. [They all draw back, and retire from the body. The Queen, who has, during the fight, &amp;c., remained at a distance, agitated with terror and suspense, now comes forward to Hereulf with the air of one who supplicates for mercy, and Dwina, following close behind her, fulls upon her knees, as if to beseech him in favour of her mistress. Queen. If thou of good king Oswal, thine old master. Aught of remembrance hastâ Her. I do remember: And deeply grieve to think a child of his Has so belied her mild and gentle stock. Nothing hast thou to fear: in some safe place, In holy privacy, mayst thou repent The evil thou hast done; for know, proud dame, Thou art beneath our vengeance. But as for thine advisers, that dark villain, The artful Alwy, and that impious man, Who does dishonour to his sacred garb, Their crimes have earn'd for them a bitter meed, And they shall have it. 2d ch. Shall we not now the slumb'ring Mercians rouse, And tell our countrymen that they are free From the oppressor's yoke? Her. Yes, thou sayst well: through all the vexed land Let every heart bound at the joyful tidings! Thus from his frowning height the tyrant falls Like a dark mountain, whose interior fires, Raging in ceaseless tumult, have devour'd Its own foundations. Sunk in sudden ruin To the tremendous gulf, in the vast void No friendly rock rears its opposing head To stay the dreadful crash. The joyful hinds, with grave and chasten'd joy, Point to the traveller the hollow vale Where once it stood, and the now sunned cots, Where, near its base, they and their little ones Dwelt trembling in its deep and fearful shade.

An open space before the walls of a castle, with wild mountains beyond it; enter Glottenbal, armed as from the lists, but bare-headed and in disorder, and his arms soiled with earth or sand, which an Attendant is now and then brushing off, whilst another follows bearing his helmet; with him enters Maurice, followed by Rudigere, who is also armed, and keeps by himself, pacing to and fro at the bottom of the stage, whilst the others come forward. Glot. (speaking as he enters, loud and boastingly). Ay, let him triumph in his paltry honours, Won by mere trick and accident. Good faith! It were a shame to call it strength or skill, Were it not, Rudigere? [Calling to Rudigere, who answers not. Maur. His brow is dark, his tongue is lock'd, my lord; There come no words from him; he bears it not So manfully as thou dost, noble Glottenbal. Glot. Fy on't! I mind it not. Maur. And wherefore shouldst thou? This same Theobald, Count and co-burgherâmixture most unseemly Of base and noble,âknow we not right well What powers assist him? Mark'd you not, my lord, How he did turn him to the witchy north, When first he mounted; making his fierce steed, That paw'd and rear'd and shook its harness'd neck In generous pride, bend meekly to the earth Its maned crest, like one who made obeisance? Glot. Ha! didst thou really see it? Maur. Yes, brave Glottenbal, I did right truly; and besides myself, Many observ'd it. Glot. Then 'tis manifest How all this foil hath been. Who e'er before Saw one with such advantage of the field, Lose it so shamefully? By my good fay! Barring foul play and other dev'lish turns, I'd keep my courser's back with any lord, Or knight, or squire, that e'er bestrode a steed. Thinkst thou not, honest Maurice, that I could? Maur. Who doubts it, good my lord? This Falkenstein Is but a clown to you. Glot. Well let him boast. Boasting I scorn; but I will shortly show him What these good arms, with no foul play against them, Can honestly achieve. Maur. Yes, good my lord; but choose you well your day: A moonless Friday luck did never bring To honest combatant. Glot. Ha! blessing on thee! I ne'er thought of this: Now it is clear how our mischance befell. Be sure thou tell to every one thou meetst, Friday and a dark moon suit Theobald. Ho there! Sir Rudigere! hearst thou not this? Rud. (as he goes off, aside to Maur.) Flatter the fool awhile and let me go, I cannot join thee now. [Exit. Glot. (looking after Rud.) Is he so crestfallen? Maur. He lacks your noble spirit. Glot. Fye upon't! I heed it not. Yet, by my sword and spurs! 'Twas a foul turn, that for my rival earn'd A branch of victory from Orra's hand. Maur. Ay, foul indeed! My blood boil'd high to see it. Look where he proudly comes. Enter Theobald armed, with attendants, having a green sprig stuck in his helmet. Glot. (going up to Theobald). Comest thou to face me so? Audacious burgher! The Lady Orra's favour suits thee not, Though for a time thou hast upon me gain'd A seeming 'vantage. Theo. A seeming 'vantage!âThen it is not true, That thou, unhors'd, layst rolling in the dust, Asking for quarter?âLet me crave thy pardon; Some strange delusion hung upon our sight That we believed it so. Glot. Off with thy taunts! And pull that sprig from its audacious perch: The favour of a dame too high for thee. Theo. Too high indeed; and hadst thou also added, Too good, too fair, I had assented to it. Yet, be it known unto your courteous worth, That were this spring a queen's gift, or receiv'd From the brown hand of some poor mountain maid; Yea, or bestow'd upon my rambling head, As in the hairy sides of browsing kid The wild rose sticks a spray, unpriz'd, unbidden, I would not give it thee. Glot. Dost thou so face me out? Then I will have it. [Snatching at it with rage. Enter Hartman. Hart. (separating them). What! Malice! after fighting in the lists As noble courteous knights! Glot. (to Hartman). Go, paltry banneret! Such friends as thou Become such lords as he, whose ruin'd state Seeks the base fellowship of restless burghers; Thinking to humble still, with envious spite, The great and noble houses of the land. I know ye well, and I defy you both, With all your damned witchery to boot. [Exit grumbling, followed by Maurice, &amp;c. Manent Theopald and Hartman. Theo. How fierce the creature is, and full of folly! Like a shent cur to his own door retired, That bristles up his furious back, and there Each passenger annoys.âAnd this is he, Whom sordid and ambitious Hughobert, The guardian in the selfish father sunk, Destines for Orra's husband.âO foul shame! The carrion-crow and royal eagle join'd, Make not so cross a match.âBut thinkst thou, Hartman, She will submit to it? Hart. That may be as thou pleasest, Falkenstein. Theo. Away with mockery! Hart. I mock thee not. Theo. Nay, banneret, thou dost, Saving this favour, Which every victor in these listed combats From ladies' hands receives, nor then regards As more than due and stated courtesy, She ne'er hath honour'd me with word or look Such hope to warrant. Hart. Wait not thou for looks. Theo. Thou wouldst not have me to a dame like this, With rich domains and titled rights encompass'd, These simple limbs, girt in their soldier's gear, My barren hills and ruin'd tower present, And say, âAcceptâthese will I nobly give In fair exchange for thee and all thy wealth.â No, Rudolph Hartman, woo the maid thyself, If thou hast courage for it. Hart. Yes, Theobald of Falkenstein, I will, And win her too; but all for thy behoof. And when I do present, as thou hast said, Those simple limbs, girt in their soldier's gear, Adding thy barren hills and ruin'd tower, With some few items more of gen'rous worth, And native sense and manly fortitude, I'll give her in return for all that she Or any maid can in such barter yield, Its fair and ample worth. Theo. So dost thou reckon. Hart. And so will Orra. Do not shake thy head. I know the maid: for still she has receiv'd me As one who knew her noble father well, And in the bloody field in which he died Fought by his side, with kind familiarity: And her stern guardian, viewing these grey hairs And this rough visage with no jealous eye Hath still admitted it.âI'll woo her for thee. Theo. I do in truth believe thou meanst me well. Hart. And this is all thou sayst? Cold frozen words! What has bewitch'd thee, man? Is she not fair? Theo. O fair indeed as woman need be form'd To please and be belov'd! Though, to speak honestly, I've fairer seen; yet such a form as Orra's For ever in my busy fancy dwells, Whene'er I think of wiving my lone state. It is not this; she has too many lures; Why wilt thou urge me on to meet her scorn? I am not worthy of her. Hart. (pushing him away with gentle anger). Go to! I praised thy modesty short-wnile, And now with dull and senseless perseverance, Thon wouldst o'erlay me with it. Go thy ways! If through thy fault, thus shrinking from the onset, She should with this untoward cub be match'd, 'Twill haunt thy conscience like a damning sin, And may it gnaw thee shrewdly! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A small apartment in the castle. Enter Rudigere musing gloomily, and muttering to himself some time before he speaks aloud. Rud. No, no; it is to formless air dissolv'd, This cherish'd hope, this vision of my brain! [Pacing to and fro, and then stopping and musing as before. I daily stood contrasted in her sight With an ungainly fool; and when she smiled, MethoughtâBut wherefore still upon this thought, Which was perhaps but a delusion then, Brood I with ceaseless torment? Never, never! O never more on me, from Orra's eye, Approving glance shall light, or gentle look! This day's disgrace mars all my goodly dreams. My path to greatness is at once shut up. Still in the dust my grov'ling fortune lies. [Striking his breast in despair. Tame thine aspiring spirit, luckless wretch! There is no hope for thee! And shall I tame it? No, by saints and devils! The laws have cast me off from every claim Of house and kindred, and within my veins Turn'd noble blood to baseness and reproach: I'll cast them off: why should they be to me A bar, and no protection? [Pacing again to and fro, and muttering low for some time before he speaks aloud. Ay; this may still within my toils enthral her; This is the secret weakness of her mind On which I'll clutch my hold. Enter Cathrina behind him, laying her hand upon him. Cath. Ha! speakst thou to thyself? Rud. (starting). I did not speak. Cath. Thou didst; thy busy mind gave sound to thoughts Which thou didst utter with a thick harsh voice, Like one who speaks in sleep. Tell me their meaning. Rud. And dost thou so presume? Be wise; be humble. [After a pause. Has Orra oft of late requested thee To tell her stories of the restless dead; Of spectres rising at the midnight watch By the lone trav'ller's bed? Cath. Wherefore of late dost thou so oft inquire Of what she says and does? Rud. Be wise, and answer what I ask of thee; This is thy duty now. Cath. Alas, alas! I know that one false step Has o'er me set a stern and ruthless master. Rud. No, madam; 'tis thy grave and virtuous seeming; Thy saint-like carriage, rigid and demure, On which thy high repute so long has stood, Endowing thee with right of censorship O'er every simple maid, whose cheerful youth Wears not so thick a mask, that o'er thee sets This ruthless master. Hereon rests my power: I might expose, and therefore I command thee. Cath. Hush, hush! approaching steps! They'll find me here! I'll do whate'er thou wilt. Rud. It is but Maurice: hie thee to thy closet, Where I will shortly come to thee. Be thou My faithful agent in a weighty matter, On which I now am bent, and I will prove Thy stay and shelter from the world's contempt. Cath. Maurice to find me here! Where shall I hide me? Rud. Nowhere, but boldly pass him as he enters. I'll find some good excuse; he will be silent: He is my agent also. Cath. Dost thou trust him? Rud. Avarice his master is, as shame is thine: Therefore I trust to deal with both.âAway! Enter Maurice, passing Cathrina as she goes out. Maur. What, doth the grave and virtuous Cathrina Vouchsafe to give thee of her company? Rud. Yes, rigid saint! she has bestow'd upon me Some grave advice to bear with pious meekness My late discomfiture. Maur. Ay, and she call'd it, I could be sworn! heaven's judgment on thy pride. Rud. E'en so: thou'st guess'd it.âShall we to the ramparts And meet the western breeze? [Exeunt. SCENE III. A spacious apartment. Enter Hughobert and Urston. Hugh. (speaking with angry gesticulation as he enters). I feed and clothe these drones, and in return They cheat, deceive, abuse me; nay, belike, Laugh in their sleeve the while. By their advice, This cursed tournay I proclaim'd; for still They puff'd me up with praises of my sonâ His grace, his skill in arms, his horsemanshipâ Count Falkenstein to him was but a clownâ And so in Orra's eyes to give him honour, Full surely did I thinkâI'll hang them all: I'll starve them in a dungeon shut from light: I'll heap my boards no more with dainty fare To feed false flatterers. Urst. That indeed were wise: But art thou sure, when men shall speak the truth, That thou wilt feed them for it? I but hinted In gentle words to thee, that Glottenbal Was praised with partial or affected zeal, And thou receiv'dst it angrily. Hugh. Ay, true indeed: but thou didst speak of him As one bereft of all capacity. Now though, God wot! I look on his defects With no blind love, and even in my ire Will sometimes call him fool; yet ne'ertheless, He still has parts and talents, though obscur'd By some untoward failings.âHeaven be praised! He wants not strength at least and well turn'd limbs, Had they but taught him how to use them. Knaves! They have neglected him. Enter Glottenbal, who draws back on seeing his father. Advance, young sir: art thou afraid of me, That thus thou shrinkest like a skulking thief To make disgrace the more apparent on thee? Glot. Yes, call it then disgrace, or what you please; Had not my lance's point somewhat awry Glanced on his shieldâ Hugh. E'en so; I doubt it not; Thy lance's point, and every thing about thee Hath glanced awry. Go, rid my house, I say, Of all those feasting flatterers that deceive thee; They harbour here no more: dismiss them quickly. Glot. Do it yourself, my lord; you are, I trow, Angry enough to do it sharply. Hugh. (turning to Urston). Faith! He gibes me fairly here; there's reason in't; Fools speak not thus. (To Glottenbal.) Go to ! if I am angry, Thou art a graceless son to tell me so. Glot. Have you not bid me still to speak the truth? Hugh. (to Urston). Again thou hearst he makes an apt reply. Urst. He wants not words. Hugh. Nor meaning neither, father. Enter Eleanora. Well, dame; where hast thou been? El. I came from Orra. Hugh. Hast thou been pleading in our son's excuse? And how did she receive it? El. I tried to do it, but her present humour Is jest and merriment. She is behind me, Stopping to stroke a hound, that in the corridor Came to her fawningly to be caress'd. Glot. (listening). Ay, she is coming; light and quick her steps; So sound they when her spirits are unruly: But I am bold; she shall not mock me now. Enter Orra, tripping gaily, and playing with the folds of her scarf. Methinks you trip it briskly, gentle dame. Orra. Does it offend you, noble knight? Glot. Go to! I know your meaning. Wherefore smile you so? Orra. Because, good sooth! with tired and aching sides I have not power to laugh. Glot. Full well I know why thou so merry art. Thou thinkst of him to whom thou gav'st that sprig Of hopeful green, his rusty casque to grace, While at thy feet his honour'd glave he laid. Orra. Nay, rather say, of him, who at my feet, From his proud courser's back, more gallantly Laid his most precious self: then stole away, Through modesty, unthank'd, nor left behind Of all his gear that flutter'd in the dust, Or glove, or band, or fragment of torn hose, For dear remembrance-sake, that in my sleeve I might have placed it. O! thou wrongst me much, To think my merriment a ref'rence hath To any one but him. (Laughing.) El. Nay, Orra; these wild fits of uncurb'd laughter, Athwart the gloomy tenor of your mind, As it has low'r'd of late, so keenly cast, Unsuited seem and strange. Orra. O nothing strange, my gentle Eleanora! Didst thou ne'er see the swallow's veering breast, Winging the air beneath some murky cloud In the sunn'd glimpses of a stormy day, Shiver in silv'ry brightness: Or boatman's oar, as vivid lightning flash In the faint gleam, that like a spirit's path Tracks the still waters of some sullen lake: Or lonely tower, from its brown mass of woods, Give to the parting of a wintry sun One hasty glance in mockery of the night Closing in darkness round it? â Gentle friend! Chide not her mirth, who was sad yesterday, And may be so to-morrow. Glot. And wherefore art thou sad, unless it is From thine own wayward humour? Other dames, Were they so courted, would be gay and happy. Orra. Wayward it needs must be, since I am sad When such perfection woos me. Pray, good Glottenbal, How didst thou learn with such a wondrous grace So high in air to toss thine armed heels, And clutch with outspread hands the slipp'ry sand? I was the more amaz'd at thy dexterity, As this, of all thy many gallant feats Before-hand promised, most modestly Thou didst forbear to mention. Glot. Gibe away! I care not for thy gibing. With fair lists, And no black arts against meâ Hugh. (advancing angrily from the bottom of the stage to Glottenbal). Hold thy peace! (To Orra.) And, madam, be at least somewhat restrain'd In your unruly humour. Orra. Pardon, my lord; I knew not you were near me. My humour is unruly; with your leave, I will retire till I have curb'd it better. (To Eleanora.) I would not lose your company, sweet countess. El. We'll go together, then. [Exeunt Orra and Eleanora. Manet Hughobert; who paces angrily about the stage, while Glottenbal stands on the front, thumping his legs with his sheathed rapier. Hugh. There is no striving with a forward girl, Nor pushing on a fool. My harass'd life Day after day more irksome grows. Curs'd bane! I'll toil no more for this untoward match. Enter Rudigere, stealing behind, and listening. Rud. You are disturb'd, my lord. Hugh. What, is it thou? I am disturb'd in sooth. Rud. Ay, Orra has been here; and some light words Of girlish levity have mov'd you. How! Toil for this match no more! What else remains, If this should be abandon'd, noble Aldenberg, That can be worth your toil? Hugh. I'll match the cub elsewhere. Rud. What call ye matching? Hugh. Surely for him some other virtuous maid Of high descent, though not so richly dower'd, May be obtain'd. Rud. Within your walls, perhaps, Some waiting gentlewoman, who perchance May be some fifty generations back Descended from a king, he will himself Ere long obtain, without your aid, my lord. Hugh. Thou mak'st me mad! the dolt! the senseless dolt! What can I do for him? I cannot force A noble maid entrusted to my care: I, the sole guardian of her helpless youth! Rud. That were indeed unfit; but there are means To make her yield consent. Hugh. Then by my faith, good friend, I'll call thee wizard, If thou canst find them out. What means already, Short of compulsion, have we left untried? And now the term of my authority Wears to its close. Rud. I know it well; and therefore powerful means, And of quick operation, must be sought. Hugh. Speak plainly to me. Rud. I've watch'd her long. I've seen her cheek, flush'd with the rosy glow Of jocund spirits, deadly pale become At tale of nightly sprite or apparition, Such as all hear, 'tis true, with greedy ears, Saying, âSaints save us!â but forget as quickly. I've marked her long; she has with all her shrewdness And playful merriment, a gloomy fancy, That broods within itself on fearful things. Hugh. And what doth this avail us? Rud. Hear me out. Your ancient castle in the Suabian forest Hath, as too well you know, belonging to it, Or false or true, frightful reports. There hold her Strictly confin'd in sombre banishment; And doubt not but she will, ere long, full gladly Her freedom purchase at the price you name. Hugh. On what pretence can I confine her there? It were most odious. Rud. Can pretence be wanting? Has she not favour shown to Theobald, Who in your neighbourhood, with his sworn friend The Banneret of Basle, suspiciously Prolongs his stay? A poor and paltry count, Unmect to match with her. And want ye then A reason for removing her with speed To some remoter quarter? Out upon it! You are too scrupulous. Hugh. Thy scheme is good, but cruel. [Glottenbal has been drawing nearer to them, and attending to the last part of their discourse. Glot. O much I like it, dearly wicked Rudigere! She then will turn her mind to other thoughts Than scornful gibes at me. Hugh. I to her father swore I would protect her: I must fulfil his will. Rud. And, in that will, her father did desire She might be match'd with this your only son: Therefore you're firmly bound all means to use That may the end attain. Hugh. Walk forth with me, we'll talk of this at large. [Exeunt Hugh. and Rud. Manet Glottenbal, who comes forward from the bottom of the stage with the action of a knight advancing to the charge. Glot. Yes, thus it is; I have the sleight o't now; And were the combat yet to come, I'd show them I'm not a whit behind the bravest knight, Cross luck excepted. Enter Maurice. Maur. My lord, indulge us of your courtesy. Glot. In what, I pray? Maur. Did not Fernando tell you? We are all met within our social bower; And I have wager'd on your head, that none But you alone, within the count's domains, Can to the bottom drain the chased horn. Come do not linger here when glory calls you. Glot. Thinkst thou that Theobald could drink so stoutly? Maur. He, paltry chief! he herds with sober burghers; A goblet, half its size, would conquer him. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. A garden with trees, and shrubs, &amp;c. Orra, Theobald, and Hartman, are discovered in a shaded walk at the bottom of the stage, speaking in dumb show, which they cross, disappearing behind the trees; and are presently followed by Cathrina and Alice, who continue walking there. Orra, Theo., and Hart. then appear again, entering near the front of the stage. Orra (talking to Hart. as she enters). And so, since fate has made me, woe the day! That poor and good-for-nothing, helpless being. Woman yclept, I must consign myself With all my lands and rights into the hands Of some proud man, and say, âTake all, I pray, And do me in return the grace and favour To be my master.â Hart. Nay, gentle lady, you constrain my words. And load them with a meaning harsh and foreign To what they truly bear.âA master! No; A valiant gentle mate, who in the field Or in the council will maintain your right: A noble, equal partner. Orra (shaking her head). Well I know, In such a partnership, the share of power Allotted to the wife. See, noble Falkenstein Hath silent been the while, nor spoke one word In aid of all your specious arguments. (To Theo.) What's your advice, my lord? Theo. Ah, noble Orra, 'Twere like self-murder to give honest counsel; Then urge me not. I frankly do confess I should be more heroic than I am. Orra. Right well I see thy head approves my plan, And by-and-bye so will thy gen'rous heart. In short, I would, without another's leave, Improve the low condition of my peasants, And cherish them in peace. E'en now, methinks, Each little cottage of my native vale Swells out its earthen sides, up-heaves its roof, Like to a hillock mov'd by lab'ring mole, And with green trail-weeds clamb'ring up its walls, Roses and ev'ry gay and fragrant plant, Before my fancy stands, a fairy bower: Ay, and within it too do fairies dwell. [Looking playfully through her fingers like a show-glass. Peep through its wreathed window, if indeed The flowers grow not too close, and there within Thou'lt see some half a dozen rosy brats Eating from wooden bowls their dainty milk;â Those are my mountain elves. Seest thou not Their very forms distinctly? Theo. Distinctly; and most beautiful the sight! A sight which sweetly stirreth in the heart Feelings that gladden and ennoble it, Dancing like sun-beams on the rippled sea; A blessed picture! Foul befall the man Whose narrow, selfish soul would shade or mar it! Hart. To this right heartily I say Amen! But if there be a man whose gen'rous soul [Turning to Orra. Like ardour fills; who would with thee pursue Thy gen'rous plan; who would his harness donâ Orra (putting her hand on him in gentle interruption). Nay, valiant banneret, who would, an't please you, His harness doff: all feuds, all strife forbear, All military rivalship, all lust Of added power, and live in steady quietness, A mild and fost'ring lord. Know you of one That would so share my task?âYou answer not; And your brave friend, methinks, casts on the ground A thoughtful look: wots he of such a lord? [To Theo. Theo. Wot I of such a lord? No, noble Orra, I do not; nor does Hartman, though perhaps His friendship may betray his judgment. No; None such exist: we are all fierce, contentious, Restless and proud, and prone to vengeful feuds; The very distant sound of war excites us, Like the curb'd courser list'ning to the chase, Who paws, and frets, and bites the rein. Trust none To cross thy gentle, but most princely purpose, Who hath on head a circling helmet worn, Or ever grasp'd a glave.âBut ne'ertheless There isâI know a man.â Might I be bold? Orra. Being so honest, boldness is your right. Theo. Permitted then, I'll say, I know a man, Though most unworthy Orra's lord to be, Who, as her champion, friend, devoted soldier, Might yet commend himself; and, so received, Who would at her command, for her defence His sword right proudly draw. An honour'd sword, Like that which at the gate of Paradise From steps profane the blessed region guarded. Orra. Thanks to the gen'rous knight! I also know The man thou wouldst commend; and when my state Such service needeth, to no sword but his Will I that service owe. Theo. Most noble Orra! greatly is he honour'd; And will not murmur that a higher wish, Too high, and too presumptuous, is repress'd. [Kissing her hand with great respect. Orra. Nay, Rudolph Hartman, clear that cloudy brow, And look on Falkenstein and on myself As two co-burghers of thy native city (For such I mean ere long to be), and claiming From thee, as cadets from an elder born, Thy cheering equal kindness. Enter a Servant. Serv. The count is now at leisure to receive The lord of Falkenstein, and Rudolph Hartman. Hart. We shall attend him shortly. [Exit servant. (Aside to Theo.) Must we now Our purpos'd suit to some pretended matter Of slighter import change? Theo. (to Hart. aside). Assuredly.â Madam, I take my leave with all devotion. Hart. I with all friendly wishes. [Exeunt Theo. and Hart. Cathrina and Alice now advance through the shrubs, &amp;c. at the bottom of the stage, while Orra remains, wrapped in thought, on the front. Cath. Madam, you're thoughtful; something occupies Your busy mind. Orra. What was't we talk'd of, when the worthy banneret With Falkenstein upon our converse broke? Cath. How we should spend our time, when in your castle You shall maintain your state in ancient splendour, With all your vassals round you. Orra. Ay, so it was. Al. And you did say, my lady, It should not be a cold unsocial grandeur: That you would keep, the while, a merry house. Orra. O doubt it not! I'll gather round my board All that heav'n sends to me of way-worn folks, And noble travellers, and neighb'ring friends, Both young and old. Within my ample hall, The worn-out man of arms (of whom too many, Nobly descended, rove like reckless vagrants From one proud chieftain's castle to another, Half chid, half honour'd) shall o' tiptoe tread, Tossing his grey locks from his wrinkled brow With cheerful freedom, as he boasts his feats Of days gone by.âMusic we'll have; and oft The bick'ring dance upon our oaken floors Shall, thund'ring loud, strike on the distant ear Of'nighted trav'llers, who shall gladly bend Their doubtful footsteps tow'rds the cheering din. Solemn, and grave, and cloister'd, and demure We shall not be. Will this content ye, damsels? Al. O passing well! 'twill be a pleasant life; Free from all stern subjection; blithe and fanciful; We'll do whate'er we list. Cath. That right and prudent is, I hope thou meanest. Al. Why ever so suspicious and so strict? How couldst thou think I had another meaning? (To Orra.) And shall we ramble in the woods full oft With hound and horn?âthat is my dearest joy. Orra. Thou runn'st me fast, good Alice. Do not doubt This shall be wanting to us. Ev'ry season Shall have its suited pastime: even Winter In its deep noon, when mountains piled with snow, And chok'd up valleys from our mansion bar All entrance, and nor guest, nor traveller Sounds at our gate; the empty hall forsaking, In some warm chamber, by the crackling fire We'll hold our little, snug, domestic court, Plying our work with song and tale between. Cath. And stories too, I ween, of ghosts and spirits, And things unearthly, that on Michael's eve Rise from the yawning tombs. Orra. Thou thinkest then one night o'th' year is truly More horrid than the rest. Cath. Perhaps 'tis only silly superstition: But yet it is well known the count's brave father Would rather on a glacier's point have lain, By angry tempests rock'd, than on that night Sunk in a downy couch in Brunier's castle. Orra. How, pray? What fearful thing did scare him so? Cath. Hast thou ne'er heard the story of Count Hugo, His ancestor, who slew the hunter-knight? Orra (eagerly). Tell it, I pray thee. Al. Cathrina, tell it not; it is not right: Such stories ever change her cheerful spirits To gloomy pensiveness; her rosy bloom To the wan colour of a shrouded corse. (To Orra.) What pleasure is there, lady, when thy hand, Cold as the valley's ice, with hasty grasp Seizes on her who speaks, while thy shrunk form Cow'ring and shiv'ring stands with keen turn'd ear To catch what follows of the pausing tale? Orra. And let me cow'ring stand, and be my touch The valley's ice: there is a pleasure in it. Al. Sayst thou indeed there is a pleasure in it? Orra. Yea, when the cold blood shoots through every vein: When every pore upon my shrunken skin A knotted knoll becomes, and to mine ears Strange inward sounds awake, and to mine eyes Rush stranger tears, there is a joy in fear. [Catching hold of Cathrina. Tell it, Cathrina, for the life within me Beats thick, and stirs to hear He slew the hunter-knight? Cath. Since I must tell it, then, the story goes That grim Count Aldenberg, the ancestor Of Hughobert, and also of yourself, From hatred or from envy, to his castle A noble knight, who hunted in the forest, Well the Black Forest named, basely decoy'd, And there, within his chamber, murder'd himâ Orra. Merciful Heaven! and in my veins there runs A murderer's blood. Saidst thou not, murder'd him? Cath. Ay; as he lay asleep, at dead of night. Orra. A deed most horrible! Cath. It was on Michael's eve; and since that time, The neighb'ring hinds oft hear the midnight yell Of spectre-hounds, and see the spectre shapes Of huntsmen on their sable steeds, with still A noble hunter riding in their van To cheer the chase, shown by the moon's pale beams, When wanes its horn in long October nights. Orra. This hath been often seen? Cath. Ay, so they say. But, as the story goes, on Michael's eve, And on that night alone of all the year, The hunter-knight himself, having a horn Thrice sounded at the gate, the castle enters; And, in the very chamber where he died, Calls on his murd'rer, or in his default Some true descendant of his house, to loose His spirit from its torment; for his body Is laid i' the earth unbless'd, and none can tell The spot of its interment. Orra. Call on some true descendant of his race! It were to such a fearful interview. But in that chamber, on that night aloneâ Hath he elsewhere to any of the race Appeared? or hath he powerâ Al. Nay, nay, forbear: See how she looks. (To Orra.) I fear thou art not well. Orra. There is a sickly faintness come upon me. Al. And didst thou say there is a joy in fear? Orra. My mind of late has strange impressionsg ta'en. I know not how it is. Al. A few nights since, Stealing o' tiptoe, softly through your chamber, Towards my ownâ Orra. O heaven defend us! didst thou see aught there? Al. Only your sleeping self. But you appear'd Distress'd and troubled in your dreams; and once I thought to wake you ere I left the chamber, But I forbore. Orra. And glad I am thou didst. It is not dreams I fear; for still with me There is an indistinctness o'er them cast, Like the dull gloom of misty twilight, where Before mine eyes pass all incongruous things, Huge, horrible, and strange, on which I stare As idiots do upon this changeful world, With nor surprise nor speculation. No; Dreams I fear not: it is the dreadful waking, When, in deep midnight stillness, the roused fancy Takes up th' imperfect shadows of its sleep, Like a marr'd speech snatch'd from a bungler's mouth, Shaping their forms distinctively and vivid To visions horrible:âthis is my bane;â It is the dreadful waking that I fear. Al. Well, speak of other things. There in good time Your ghostly father comes with quicken'd steps, Like one who bears some tidings good or ill. Heaven grant they may be good! Enter Urston. Orra. Father, you seem disturb'd. Urst. Daughter, I am in truth disturb'd. The count All o' the sudden, being much enraged That Falkenstein still lingers near these walls, Resolves to send thee hence, to be awhile In banishment detain'd, till on his son Thou lookst with better favour. Orra. Ay, indeed! That is to say perpetual banishment: A sentence light or heavy, as the place Is sweet or irksome he would send me to. Urst. He will contrive to make it, doubt him not, Irksome enough. Therefore I would advise thee To feign at least, but for a little time, A disposition to obey his wishes. He's stern, but not relentless; and his dame, The gentle Eleanor, will still befriend you, When fit occasion serves. Orra. What saidst thou, father? To feign a disposition to obey! I did mistake thy words. Urst. No, gentle daughter; So press'd, thou mayest feign and yet be blameless. A trusty guardian's faith with thee he holds not, And therefore thou art free to meet his wrongs With what defence thou hast. Orra (proudly). Nay, pardon me; I, with an unshorn crown, Must hold the truth in plain simplicity, And am in nice distinctions most unskilful. Urst. Lady, have I deserv'd this sharpness? oft Thine infant hand has strok'd this shaven crown: Thou'st ne'er till now reproach'd it. Orra (bursting into tears). Pardon, O pardon me, my gentle Urston! Pardon a wayward child, whose eager temper Doth sometimes mar the kindness of her heart. Father, am I forgiven? (Hanging on him.) Urst. Thou art, thou art: Thou art forgiven; more than forgiven, my child. Orra. Then lead me to the count, I will myself Learn his stern purpose. Urst. In the hall he is, Seated in state, and waiting to receive you. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A spacious apartment, or baron's hall, with a chair of state. Hughobert, Eleanora, and Glottenbal enter near the front, speaking as they enter; and afterwards enter Vassals and Attendants, who range themselves at the bottom of the stage. Hugh. Cease, dame! I will not hear; thou striv'st in vain With thy weak pleadings. Orra hence must go Within the hour, unless she will engage Her plighted word to marry Glottenbal. Glot. Ay, and a mighty hardship, by the mass! Hugh. I've summon'd her in solemn form before me, That these my vassals should my act approve, Knowing my right of guardianship; and also That her late father, in his dying moments, Did will she should be married to my son; Which will, she now must promise to obey, Or take the consequence. El. But why so hasty? Hugh. Why, sayst thou? Falkenstein still in these parts Lingers with sly intent. Even now he left me, After an interview of small importance, Which he and Hartman, as a blind pretence For seeing Orra, formally requested. I say again she must forthwith obey me, Or take the consequence of wayward will. El. Nay, not for Orra do I now entreat So much as for thyself. Bethink thee well What honour thou shalt have, when it is known Thy ward from thy protecting roof was sent; Thou who shouldst be to her a friend, a father. Hugh. But do I send her unprotected? No! Brave Rudigere conducts her with a band Of trusty spearmen. In her new abode She will be safe as here. El. Ha! Rudigere! Putst thou such trust in him? Alas, my lord! His heart is full of cunning and deceit. Wilt thou to him the flower of all thy race Rashly intrust? O be advised, my lord! Hugh. Thy ghostly father tells thee so, I doubt not. Another priest confesses Rudigere, And Urston likes him not. But canst thou think, With aught but honest purpose, he would chose From all her women the severe Cathrina, So strictly virtuous, for her companion? This puts all doubt to silence. Say no more, Else I shall think thou pleadst against my son, More with a step-dame's than a mother's feelings. Glot. Ay, marry does she, father! And forsooth! Regards me as a fool. No marvel then That Orra scorns me; being taught by her,â How should she else?âSo to consider me! Hugh. (to Glottenbal). Tut! hold thy tongue. El. He wrongs me much, my lord. Hugh. No more, for here she comes. Enter Orra, attended by Urston, Alice and Cathrina, whilst Hughobert seats himself in his chair of state, the vassals, &amp;c. ranging themselves on each side. Hugh. (to Orra). Madam and ward, placed under mine authority, And to my charge committed by my kinsman, Ulric of Aldenberg, thy noble father: Having all gentle means essay'd to win thee To the fulfilment of his dying will, That did decree his heiress should be married With Glottenbal my heir; I solemnly Now call upon thee, ere that rougher means Be used for this good end, to promise truly Thou wilt, within a short and stated time, Before the altar give thy plighted faith To this my only son. I wait thine answer. Orra of Aldenberg, wilt thou do this? Orra. Count of the same, my lord and guardian, I will not. Hugh. Have a care, thou froward maid! 'Tis thy last opportunity: ere long Thou shalt, within a dreary dwelling pent, Count thy dull hours, told by the dead man's watch, And wish thou hadst not been so proudly wilful. Orra. And let my dull hours by the dead man's watch Be told; yea, make me too the dead man's mate, My dwelling place the nailed coffin; still I would prefer it to the living lord Your goodness offers me. Hugh. Art thou bewitch'd? Is he not young, well featured and well form'd? And dost thou put him in thy estimation With bones and sheeted clay? Beyond endurance is thy stubborn spirit. Right well thy father knew that all thy sex Stubborn and headstrong are; therefore, in wisdom, He vested me with power that might compel thee To what he will'd should be. Orra. O not in wisdom! Say rather in that weak, but gen'rous faith, Which said to him, the cope of heaven would fall And smother in its cradle his swath'd babe, Rather than thou. his mate in arms, his kinsman, Who by his side in many a field had fought, Shouldst take advantage of his confidence For sordid ends.â My brave and noble father! A voice comes from thy grave and cries against it, And bids me to be bold. Thine awful form Rises before me,âand that look of anguish On thy dark brow!âO no! I blame thee not. Hugh. Thou seemst beside thyself with such wild gestures And strangely-flashing eyes. Repress these fancies, And to plain reason listen. Thou hast said, For sordid ends I have advantage ta'en. Since thy brave father's death, by war and compact, Thou of thy lands hast lost a third; whilst I, By happy fortune, in my heir's behalf, Have doubled my domains to what they were When Ulric chose him as a match for thee. Orra. O, and what speaketh this, but that my father Domains regarded not; and thought a man Such as the son should be of such a man As thou to him appear'dst, a match more honourable Than one of ampler state. Take thou from Glottenbal The largely added lands of which thou boastest, And put, in lieu thereof, into his stores Some weight of manly sense and gen'rous worth, And I will say thou keepst faith with thy friend: But as it is, although a king's domains Increas'd thy wealth, thou poorly wouldst deceive him. Hugh. (rising from his chair in anger). Now, madam, be all counsel on this matter Between us closed. Prepare thee for thy journey. El. Nay, good my lord! consider. Hugh. (to Eleanora). What, again! Have I not said thou hast an alien's heart From me and mine. Learn to respect my will: âBe silent, as becomes a youthful dame. Urst. For a few days may she not still remain? Hugh. No, priest; not for an hour. It is my pleasure That she for Brunier's castle do set forth Without delay. Orra (with a faint starting movement). In Brunier's castle! Hugh. Ay; And doth this change the colour of thy cheek, And give thy alter'd voice a feebler sound? [Aside to Glottenbal. She shrinks, now to her, boy; this is thy time. Glot. (to Orra). Unless thou wilt, thou needst not go at all. There is full many a maiden would right gladly Accept the terms we offer, and remain. (A pause.) Wilt thou not answer me? Orra. I heard thee not.â I heard thy voice, but not thy words. What saidst thou? Glot. I say, there's many a maiden would right gladly Accept the terms we offer, and remain. The daughter of a king hath match'd ere now With mine inferior. We are link'd together As 'twere by right and natural property. And as I've said before I say again, I love thee too: what more couldst thou desire? Orra. I thank thee for thy courtship, though uncouth; For it confirms my purpose: and my strength Grows as thou speakst, firm like the deep-bas'd rock. (To Hughobert). Now for my journey when you will, my lord! I'm ready. Hugh. Be it so! on thine own head Rest all the blame! [Going from her. Perverse past all belief! [Turning round to her sternly. Orra of Aldenberg, wilt thou obey me? Orra. Count of that noble house, with all respect, Again I say I will not. [Exit Hughobert in anger, followed by Glottenbal, Urston, &amp;c. Manent anly Eleanora, Cathrina, Alice, and Orra, who keeps up with stately pride till Hughobert and all attendants are gone out, and then throwing herself into the arms of Eleanora, gives vent to her feelings. El. Sweet Orra! be not so depress'd; thou goest For a short term, soon to return again; The banishment is mine, who stays behind. But I will beg of heaven with ceaseless prayers To have thee soon restored: and, when I dare, Will plead with Hughobert in thy behalf; He is not always stern. Orra. Thanks, gentle friend! Thy voice to me doth ring Like the last tones of kindly nature; dearly In my remembrance shall they rest.âWhat sounds, What sights, what horrid intercourse I may, Ere we shall meet again, be doom'd to prove, High heaven alone doth know.âIf that indeed We e'er shall meet again! [Falls on her neck and weeps. El. Nay, nay! come to my chamber. There awhile Compose your spirits. Be not so depress'd. [Exeunt. [Rudigere, who has appeared, during the last part of the above scene, at the bottom of the stage, half concealed, as if upon the watch, now comes forward, speaking as he advances. Hold firm her pride till fairly from these walls Our journey is begun; then fortune hail! Thy favours are secured. [Looking off the stage. Ho, Maurice there! Enter Maurice. My faithful Maurice, I would speak with thee. I leave thee here behind me; to thy care, My int'rests I commit; be it thy charge To counteract thy lady's influence, Who will entreat her lord the term to shorten Of Orra's absence, maiming thus my plan, Which must, belike, have time to be effected. Be vigilant, be artful; and be sure Thy services I amply will repay. Maur. Ay, thou hast said so, and I have believ'd thee. Rud. And dost thou doubt? Maur. No; yet meantime, good sooth! If somewhat of thy bounty I might finger, 'Twere well: I like to have some actual proof. Didst thou not promise it? Rud. 'Tis true I did, But other pressing calls have drain'd my means. Maur. And other pressing calls my ebbing faith May also drain, and change my promis'd purpose. Rud. Go to! I know thou art a greedy leech, Though ne'ertheless thou lov'st me. [Taking a small case from his pocket, which he opens. Seest thou here? I have no coin; but look upon these jewels: I took them from a knight I slew in battle. When I am Orra's lord, thou shalt receive, Were it ten thousand crowns, whate'er their worth Shall by a skilful lapidary be In honesty esteem'd. [Gives him the jewels. Maur. I thank thee, but methinks their lustre's dim. I've seen the stones before upon thy breast In gala days, but never heard thee boast They were of so much value. Rud. I was too prudent: I had lost them else. To no one but thyself would I entrust The secret of their value. Enter Servant. Serv. Sir Rudigere, the spearmen are without, Waiting your further orders, for the journey. Rud. (to servant). I'll come to them anon. [Exit servant. Before I go, I'll speak to thee again. [Exeunt severally. ACT III. SCENE I A forest with a half-ruined castle in the background, seen through the trees by moonlight. Franko and several Outlaws are discovered sitting on the ground, round a fire, with flagons, &amp;c. by them, as if they had been drinking. Song of several voices. The chough and crow to roost are gone, The owl sits on the tree, The hush'd wind wails with feeble moan, Like infant charity. The wild-fire dances on the fen, The red star sheds its ray, Uprouse ye, then, my merry men! It is our op'ning day. Both child and nurse are fast asleep, And clos'd is every flower, And winking tapers faintly peep High from my lady's bower; Bewilder'd hinds with shorten'd ken Shrink on their murky way, Uprouse, ye, then, my merry men! It is our op'ning day. Nor board nor garner own we now, Nor roof nor latched door, Nor kind mate, bound by holy vow To bless a good man's store; Noon lulls us in a gloomy den, And night is grown our day, Uprouse ye, then, my merry men! And use it as ye may. Franko (to1st out.). How lik'st thou this, Fernando? 1st out. Well sung i' faith! but serving ill our turn, Who would all trav'llers and benighted folks Scare from our precincts. Such sweet harmony Will rather tempt invasion. Franko. Fear not, for mingled voices, heard afar, Through glade and glen and thicket, stealing on To distant list'ners, seem wild-goblin-sounds; At which the lonely trav'ller checks his steed, Pausing with long-drawn breath and keen-turn'd ear, And twilight pilferers cast down in haste Their ill-got burthens, while the homeward hind Turns from his path, full many a mile about, Through bog and mire to grope his blund'ring way. Such, to the startled ear of superstition, Were seraph's song, could we like seraphs sing. Enter 2d outlaw, hastily. 2d out. Disperse ye diff'rent ways: we are undone. Franko. How sayst thou, shrinking poltroon? we undone! Outlaw'd and ruin'd men, who live by daring! 2d out. A train of armed men, some noble dame Escorting (so their scatter'd words discover'd As, unperceiv'd, I hung upon their rear), Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night Within the castle. Franko. Some benighted travellers, Bold from their numbers, or who ne'er have heard The ghostly legend of this dreaded place. 1out. Let us keep close within our vaulted haunts; The way to which is tangled and perplex'd, And cannot be discover'd: with the morn They will depart. Franko. Nay, by the holy mass! within those walls Not for a night must trav'llers quietly rest, Or few or many. Would we live securely, We must uphold the terrors of the place: Therefore, let us prepare our midnight rouse. See, from the windows of the castle gleam [Lights seen from the castle. Quick passing lights, as though they moved within In hurried preparation; and that bell, [Bell heard. Which from yon turret its shrill 'larum sends, Betokens some unwonted stir. Come, hearts! Be all prepared, before the midnight watch, The fiend-like din of our infernal chace Around the walls to raise.âCome; night advances. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Gothic room in the castle, with the stage darkened. Enter Cathrina, bearing a light, followed by Orra. Orra (catching her by the robe and pulling her back). Advance no further: turn, I pray! This room More dismal and more ghastly seems than that Which we have left behind. Thy taper's light, As thus aloft thou wav'st it to and fro, The fretted ceiling gilds with feeble brightness; While over-head its carved ribs glide past Like edgy waves of a dark sea, returning To an eclipsed moon its sullen sheen. Cath. To me it seems less dismal than the other. See, here are chairs around the table set, As if its last inhabitants had left it Scarcely an hour ago. [Setting the light upon the table. Orra. Alas! how many hours and years have past Since human forms around this table sat, Or lamp or taper on its surface gleam'd! Methinks I hear the sound of time long past Still murm'ring o'er us in the lofty void Of those dark arches, like the ling'ring voices Of those who long within their graves have slept. It was their gloomy home; now it is mine. [Sits down, resting her arm upon the table, and covering her eyes with her hand. Enter Rudigere, beckoning Cathrina to come to him; and speaks to her in a low voice at the corner of the stage. Go and prepare thy lady's chamber; why Dost thou for ever closely near her keep? Cath. She charged me so to do. Rud. I charge thee also With paramount authority, to leave her: I for awhile will take thy station here. Thou art not mad? Thou dost not hesitate? [Fixing his eyes on her with a fierce threatening look, from which she shrinks. Exit Cath. Orra. This was the home of bloody lawless power. The very air rests thick and heavily Where murder hath been done. (Sighing heavily.) There is a strange oppression in my breast: Dost thou not feel a close unwholesome vapour? Rud. No; ev'ry air to me is light and healthful, That with thy sweet and heavenly breath is mix'd. Orra (starting up). Thou here! (Looking round.) Cathrina gone? Rud. Does Orra fear to be alone with one, Whose weal, whose being on her favour hangs? Orra. Retire, Sir Knight. I choose to be alone. Rud. And dost thou choose it, here, in such a place, Wearing so near the midnight hour?âAlas! How loath'd and irksome must my presence be! Orra. Dost thou deride my weakness? Rud. I deride it! No, noble maid! say rather that from thee I have a kindred weakness caught. In battle My courage never shrank, as my arm'd heel And crested helm do fairly testify: But now when midnight comes, I feel by sympathy, With thinking upon thee, fears rise within me I never knew before. Orra (in a softened kindlier voice). Ha! dost thou too Such human weakness own? Rud. I plainly feel We are all creatures, in the wakeful hour Of ghastly midnight, form'd to cower together, Forgetting all distinctions of thÃ© day, Beneath its awful and mysterious power. [Stealing closer to her as he speaks, and putting his arms round her. Orra (breaking from him). I pray thee hold thy parley further off: Why dost thou press so near me? Rud. And art thou so offended, lovely Orra? Ah! wherefore am I thus presumptuous deem'd? The blood that fills thy veins enriches mine; From the same stock we spring; though by that glance Of thy disdainful eye, too well I see My birth erroneously thou countest base. Orra. Erroneously! Rud. Yes, I will prove it so. Longer I'll not endure a galling wrong Which makes each word of tenderness that bursts From a full heart, bold and presumptuous seem, And severs us so far. Orra. No, subtile snake! It is the baseness of thy selfish mind, Full of all guile, and cunning, and deceit, That severs us so far, and shall do ever. Rud. Thou prov'st how far my passion will endure Unjust reproaches from a mouth so dear. Orra. Out on hypocrisy! who but thyself Did Hughobert advise to send me hither? And who the jailor's hateful office holds To make my thraldom sure? Rud. Upbraid me not for this: had I refused, One less thy friend had ta'en th' ungracious task. And, gentle Orra! dost thou know a man, Who might in ward all that his soul holds dear From danger keep, yet would the charge refuse, For that strict right such wardship doth condemn? O! still to be with thee; to look upon thee; To hear thy voice, makes even this place of horrors,â Where, as 'tis said, the spectre of a chief, Slain by our common grandsire, haunts the night, A paradiseâa place where I could live In penury and gloom, and be most bless'd. Ah! Orra! if there's misery in thraldom, Pity a wretch who breathes but in thy favour: Who till he look'd upon that beauteous face, Was free and happy.âPity me or kill me! [Kneeling and catching hold of her hand. Orra. Off, fiend! let snakes and vipers cling to me So thou dost keep aloof. Rud. (rising indignantly). And is my love with so much hatred met? Madam, beware lest scorn like this should change me E'en to the baleful thing your fears have fancied. Orra. Dar'st thou to threaten me? Rud. He, who is mad with love and gall'd with scorn, Dares any thing.âBut O! forgive such words From one who rather, humbled at your feet, Would of that gentleness, that gen'rous pity, The native inmate of each female breast, Receive the grace on which his life depends. There was a time when thou didst look on me With other eyes. Orra. Thou dost amaze me much. Whilst I believ'd thou wert an honest man, Being no fool, and an adventurous soldier, I look'd upon thee with good-will; if more Thou didst discover in my looks than this, Thy wisdom with thine honesty, in truth, Was fairly match'd. Rud. Madam, the proud derision of that smile Deceives me not. It is the lord of Falkenstein, Who better skill'd than I in tournay-war, Though not in th' actual field more valiant found, Engrosses now your partial thoughts. And yet What may he boast which, in a lover's suit, I may not urge? He's brave, and so am I. In birth I am his equal; for my mother, As I shall prove, was married to Count Albert, My noble father, though for reasons tedious Here to be stated, still their secret nuptials Were unacknowledg'd, and on me hath fallen A cruel stigma which degrades my fortunes. But were IâO forgive th' aspiring thought!â But were I Orra's lord, I should break forth Like the unclouded sun, by all acknowledg'd As ranking with the highest in the land. Orra. Do what thou wilt when thou art Orra's lord; But being as thou art, retire and leave me: I choose to be alone. (Very proudly.) Rud. Then be it so. Thy pleasure, mighty dame, I will not balk. This night, to-morrow's night, and every night, Shalt thou in solitude be left; if absence Of human beings can secure it for thee. [Pauses and looks on her, while she seems struck and disturbed. It wears already on the midnight hour; Good night! [Pauses again, she still more disturbed. Perhaps I understood too hastily Commands you may retract. Orra (recovering her state). Leave me, I say; that part of my commands I never can retract. Rud. You are obey'd. [Exit. Orra (paces up and down hastily for some time, then stops short, and after remaining a little while in a thoughtful posture). Can spirit from the tomb, or fiend from hell, More hateful, more malignant be than manâ Than villanous man? Although to look on such, Yea, even the very thought of looking on them, Makes natural blood to curdle in the veins, And loosen'd limbs to shake, There are who have endur'd the visitation Of supernatural beings.âO forefend it! I would close couch me to my deadliest foe Rather than for a moment bear alone The horrors of the sight. Who's there? who's there? [Looking round. Heard I not voices near? That door ajar Sends forth a cheerful light. Perhaps my women, Who now prepare my chamber. Grant it be! [Exit, running hastily to a door from which a light is seen. SCENE III. A chamber, with a small bed or couch in it. Enter Rudigere and Cathrina, wrangling together. Rud. I say begone, and occupy the chamber I have appointed for thee: here I'm fix'd, And here I pass the night. Cath. Thou saidst my chamber Should be adjoining that which Orra holds? I know thy wicked thoughts: they meditate Some dev'lish scheme; but think not I'll abet it. Rud. Thou wilt not!âangry, restive, simple fool! Dost thou stop short and say, âI'll go no further?â Thou, whom concealed shame hath bound so fast,â My tool,âmy instrument?âFulfil thy charge To the full bent of thy commission, else Thee, and thy bantling too, I'll from me cast To want and infamy. Cath. O, shameless man! Thou art the son of a degraded mother As low as I am, yet thou hast no pity. Rud. Ay, and dost thou reproach my bastardy To make more base the man who conquer'd thee, With all thy virtue, rigid and demure? Who would have thought less than a sovereign prince Could e'er have compass'd such achievement? Mean As he may be, thou'st given thyself a master, And must obey him.âDost thou yet resist? Thou know'st my meaning. [Tearing open his vest in vehemence of action. Cath. Under thy vest a dagger!âAh! too well, I know thy meaning, cruel, ruthless man! Rud. Have I discovered it?âI thought not of it: The vehemence of gesture hath betray'd me. I keep it not for thee, but for myself; A refuge from disgrace. Here is another: He who with high, but dangerous fortune grapples, Should he be foil'd, looks but to friends like these. [Pulling out two daggers from his vest. This steel is strong to give a vig'rous thrust; The other on its venom'd point hath that Which, in the feeblest hand, gives death as certain, As though a giant smote the destin'd prey. Cath. Thou desp'rate man! so arm'd against thyself! Rud. Ay; and against myself with such resolves, Consider well how I shall deal with those Who may withstand my will or mar my purpose. Thinkst thou I'll feeblyâ Cath. O be pacified. I will begone: I am a humbled wretch On whom thou tramplest with a tyrant's cruelty. [Exit. Rud. (looks after her with a malignant laugh, and then goes to the door of an adjoining chamber, to the lock of which he applies his ear). All still withinâI'm tired and heavy grown: I'll lay me down to rest. She is secure: No one can pass me here to gain her chamber. If she hold parley now with any thing, It must in truth be ghost or sprite.âHeigh ho! I'm tir'd, and will to bed. [Lays himself on the couch and falls asleep. The cry of hounds is then heard without at a distance, with the sound of a horn; and presently Orra enters, bursting from the door of the adjoining chamber, in great alarm. Orra. Cathrina! sleepest thou? Awake! awake! [Running up to the couch and starting back on seeing Rudigere. That hateful viper here! Is this my nightly guard? Detested wretch! I will steal back again. [Walks softly on tiptoe to the door of her chamber, when the cry of hounds, &amp;c. is again heard without, nearer than before. O no! I dare not. Though sleeping, and most hateful when awake, Still he is natural life and may be rous'd. [Listening again. 'Tis nearer now: that dismal thrilling blast! I must awake him. [Approaching the couch and shrinking back again. O no! no, no! Upon his face he wears a horrid smile That speaks bad thoughts. [Rud. speaks in his sleep. He mutters too my name.â I dare not do it. [Listening again. The dreadful sound is now upon the wind, Sullen and low, as if it wound its way Into the cavern'd earth that swallow'd it. I will abide in patient silence here; Though hateful and asleep, I feel me still Near something of my kind. [Crosses her arms, and leans in a cowering posture over the back of a chair at a distance from the couch; when presently the horn is heard without, louder than before, and she starts up. O it returns! as though the yawning earth Had given it up again, near to the walls. The horribly mingled din! 'tis nearer still: 'Tis close at hand: 'tis at the very gate! [Running up to the couch. Were he a murd'rer, clenching in his hands The bloody knife, I must awake him.âNo! That face of dark and subtle wickedness! I dare not do it. (Listening again.) Ay; 'tis at the gateâ Within the gate.â What rushing blast is that Shaking the doors? Some awful visitation Dread entrance makes! O mighty God of Heav'n! A sound ascends the stairs. Ho, Rudigere! Awake, awake! Ho! wake thee, Rudigere! Rud. (waking). What cry is that so terribly strong? â Ha! Orra! What is the matter? Orra. It is within the walls. Didst thou not hear it? Rud. What? The loud voice that called me? Orra. No, it was mine. Rud. It sounded in my ears With more than human strength. Orra. Did it so sound? There is around us, in this midnight air, A power surpassing nature. List, I pray: Although more distant now, dost thou not hear The yell of hounds; the spectre-huntsman's horn? Rud. I hear, indeed, a strangely mingled sound: The wind is howling round the battlements. But rest secure where safety is, sweet Orra! Within these arms, nor man nor fiend shall harm thee. [Approaching her with a softened winning voice, while she pushes him off with abhorrence. Orra. Vile reptile! touch me not. Rud. Ah! Orra! thou art warp'd by prejudice, And taught to think me base; but in my veins Lives noble blood, which I will justify. Orra. But in thy heart, false traitor! what lives there? Rud. Alas! thy angel-faultlessness conceives not The strong temptations of a soul impassion'd Beyond control of reason.âAt thy feetâ [Kneeling. O spurn me not! Enter several Servants, alarmed. Rud. What, all these fools upon us! Staring knaves, What brings ye here at this untimely hour? 1st serv. We have all heard itâ'twas the yell of hounds And clatt'ring steeds, and the shrill horn between. Rud. Out on such folly! 2d serv. In very truth it pass'd close to the walls; Did not your honour hear it? Rud. Ha! sayst thou so? thou art not wont to join In idle tales.âI'll to the battlements And watch it there: it may return again. [Exeunt severally, Rudigere followed by servants, and Orra into her own chamber. SCENE IV. The Outlaws' cave. Enter Theobald. Theo. (looking round). Here is a place in which some traces are Of late inhabitants. In yonder nook The embers faintly gleam, and on the walls Hang spears and ancient arms: I must be right A figure through the gloom moves towards me. Ho! there! Whoe'er you are: Holla! good friend! Enter an Outlaw. Out. A stranger! Who art thou, who art thus bold, To hail us here unbidden? Theo. That thou shalt shortly know. Thou art, I guess, One of the outlaw'd band who haunt this forest. Out. Be thy conjecture right or wrong, no more Shalt thou return to tell where thou hast found us. Now for thy life! [Drawing his sword. Theo. Hear me, I do entreat thee. Out. Nay, nay! no foolish pleadings; for thy life Is forfeit now; have at thee! [Falls fiercely upon Theobald, Who also draws and defends himself bravely, when another outlaw enters and falls likewise upon him. Theo. then recedes fighting, till he gets his back to the wall of the cavern, and there defends himself stoutly. Enter Franko. Franko. Desist, I charge you! Fighting with a stranger, Two swords to oneâa solitary stranger! 1st out. We are discover'd; had he master'd me, He had return'd to tell his mates above What neighbours in these nether caves they have. Let us despatch him. Franko. No, thou hateful butcher! Despatch a man alone and in our power! Who art thou, stranger, who dost use thy sword With no mean skill; and in this perilous case So bold an air and countenance maintainest? What brought thee hither? Theo. My name is Theobald of Falkenstein; To find the valiant captain of these bands, And crave assistance of his gen'rous arm: This is my business here. Franko (struck and agitated, to his men). Go, join your comrades in the further cave. [Exeunt outlaws. And thou art Falkenstein? In truth thou art. And who thinkst thou am I? Theo. Franko, the gen'rous leader of those outlaws. Franko. So am I call'd, and by that name alone They know me. Sporting on the mountain's side, Where Garva's wood waves green, in other days, Some fifteen years ago, they call'd me Albert. Theo. (rushing into his arms). Albert; my playmate Albert! Woe the day! What cruel fortune drove thee to this state? Franko. I'll tell thee all! but tell thou first to me What is the aid thou camest here to ask. Theo. Ay, thou wert ever thus: still forward bent To serve, not to be serv'd. But wave we this. Last night a lady to the castle came, In thraldom by a villain kept, whom I E'en with my life would rescue. Of armed force At present destitute, I come to thee Craving thy aid in counsel and in arms. Franko. When didst thou learn that outlaws harbour here, For 'tis but lately we have held these haunts? Theo. Not till within the precincts of the forest, Following the traces of that villain's course, One of your band I met, and recogniz'd As an old soldier, who, some few years back, Had under my command right bravely serv'd. Seeing himself discover'd, and encouraged By what I told him of my story, freely He offer'd to conduct me to his captain. But in a tangled path some space before me, Alarm'd at sight of spearmen through the brake, He started from his way, and so I miss'd him, Making my way alone to gain your cave. Franko. Thou'rt welcome here: and gladly I'll assist thee, Though not by arms, the force within the castle So far out-numbering mine. But other means may serve thy purpose better. Theo. What other means, I pray? Franko. From these low caves, a passage under ground Leads to the castleâto the very tower Where, as I guess, the lady is confin'd. When sleep has still'd the house, we'll make our way. Theo. Ay, by my faith it is a noble plan! Guarded or not, we well may overcome The few that may compose her midnight guard. Franko. We shall not shrink from that.âBut by my fay! To-morrow is St. Michael's eve: 'twere well To be the spectre-huntsman for a night, And bear her off, without pursuit or hindrance. Theo. I comprehend thee not. Franko. Thou shalt ere long. But stand not here; an inner room I have, Where thou shalt rest and some refreshment take, And then we will more fully talk of this, Which, slightly mention'd, seems chimerical. Follow me. [Turning to him as they go out. Hast thou still upon thine arm That mark which from mine arrow thou receiv'dst When sportively we shot? The wound was deep, And gall'd thee much, but thou mad'st light of it. Theo. Yes, here it is. [Pulling up his sleeve as they go out, and Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. The ramparts of the castle. Enter Orra and Cathrina. Cath. (after a pause, in which Orra walks once or twice across the stage, thoughtfully). Go in, I pray; thou wand'rest here too long. [A pause again. The air is cold; behind those further mountains The sun is set. I pray thee now go in. Orra. Ha! sets the sun already? Is the day Indeed drawn to its close? Cath. Yes, night approaches. See, many a gather'd flock of cawing rooks Are to their nests returning. Orra (solemnly). Night approaches!â This awful night which living beings shrink from; All now of every kind scour to their haunts, While darkness, peopled with its hosts unknown, Awful dominion holds. Mysterious night! What things unutterable thy dark hours May lap!âWhat from thy teeming darkness burst Of horrid visitations, ere that sun Again shall rise on the enlighten'd earth! [A pause. Cath. Why dost thou gaze intently on the sky? Seest thou aught wonderful? Orra. Look there, behold that strange gigantic form Which yon grim cloud assumes; rearing aloft The semblance of a warrior's plumed head, While from its half-shaped arm a streamy dart Shoots angrily! Behind him too, far stretch'd, Seems there not, verily, a serried line Of fainter misty forms? Cath. I see, indeed, A vasty cloud, of many clouds composed, Towering above the rest; and that behind In misty faintness seen, which hath some likeness To a long line of rocks with pine-wood crown'd: Or, if indeed the fancy so incline, A file of spearmen, seen through drifted smoke. Orra. Nay, look how perfect now the form becomes: Dost thou not see?âAy, and more perfect still. O thou gigantic lord, whose robed limbs Beneath their stride span half the heavens! art thou Of lifeless vapour formed? Art thou not rather Some air-clad spiritâsome portentous thingâ Some mission'd beingâSuch a sky as this Ne'er usher'd in a night of nature's rest. Cath. Nay, many such I've seen; regard it not. That form, already changing, will ere long Dissolve to nothing. Tarry here no longer. Go in, I pray. Orra. No; while one gleam remains Of the sun's blessed light, I will not go. Cath. Then let me fetch a cloak to keep thee warm, For chilly blows the breeze. Orra. Do as thou wilt. [Exit Cath. Enter an Outlaw, stealing softly behind her. Out. (in a low voice). Lady!âthe Lady Orra! Orra (starting). Heaven protect me! Sounds it beneath my feet, in earth or air? [He comes forward. Welcome is aught that wears a human face. Didst thou not hear a sound? Out. What sound, an't please you? Orra. A voice which call'd me now: it spoke, methought, In a low, hollow tone, suppress'd and low, Unlike a human voice. Out. It was my own. Orra. What wouldst thou have? Out. Here is a letter, lady. Orra. Who sent thee hither? Out. It will tell thee all. [Gives a letter. I must begone, your chieftain is at hand. [Exit. Orra. Comes it from Falkenstein? It is his seal. I may not read it here. I'll to my chamber. [Exit hastily, not perceiving Rudigere, who enters by the opposite side, before she has time to go off. Rud. A letter in her hand, and in such haste! Some secret agent here from Falkenstein? It must be so. [Hastening after her, Exit. SCENE II. The Outlaws cave. Enter Theobald and Franko by opposite sides. Theo. How now, good captain; draws it near the time? Are those the keys? Franko. They are: this doth unlock The entrance to the staircase, known alone To Gomez, ancient keeper of the castle, Who is my friend in secret, and deters The neighb'ring peasantry with dreadful tales From visiting by night our wide domains. The other doth unlock a secret door, That leads us to the chamber where she sleeps. Theo. Thanks, gen'rous friend! thou art my better genius. Didst thou not say, until the midnight horn Hath sounded thrice, we must remain conceal'd? Franko. Even so. And now I hear my men without Telling the second watch. Theo. How looks the night? Franko. As we could wish: the stars do faintly twinkle Through sever'd clouds, and shed but light sufficient To show each nearer object closing on you In dim unshapely blackness. Aught that moves Across your path, or sheep or straggling goat, Is now a pawing steed or grizzly bull, Large and terrific; every air-mov'd bush Or jutting crag, some strange gigantic thing. Theo. Is all still in the castle? Franko. There is an owl sits hooting on the tower, That answer from a distant mate receives, Like the faint echo of his dismal cry; While a poor houseless dog by dreary fits Sits howling at the gate. All else is still. Theo. Each petty circumstance is in our favour, That makes the night more dismal. Franko. Ay, all goes well; as I approach'd the walls, I heard two sentinelsâfor now, I ween, The boldest spearman will not watch aloneâ Together talk in the deep hollow voice Of those who speak at midnight, under awe Of the dead stillness round them. Theo. Then let us put ourselves in readiness, And heaven's good favour guide us! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A gloomy apartment. Enter Orra and Rudigere. Orra (aside). The room is darken'd: yesternight a lamp Did shed its light around on roof and walls, And made the dreary space appear less dismal. Rud. (overhearing her, and calling to a servant without). Ho! more lights here! [Servant enters with a light and exit. Thou art obey'd: in aught But in the company of human kind, Thou shalt be gratified. Thy lofty mind For higher superhuman fellowship, If such there be, may now prepare its strength. Orra. Thou ruthless tyrant! They who have in battle Fought valiantly, shrink like a helpless child From any intercourse with things unearthly. Art thou a man? And bearst thou in thy breast The feelings of a man? It cannot be! Rud. Yes, madam; in my breast I bear too keenly The feelings of a manâa man most wretched: A scorn'd, rejected man.âMake me less miserable; Nay rather should I say, make me most blest; And thenâ Attempting to take her hand, while she steps back from him, drawing herself up with an air stately and determined, and looking steadfastly in his face. I too am firm. Thou knowst my fix'd resolve: Give me thy solemn promise to be mine. This is the price, thou haughty, scornful maid, That will redeem thee from the hour of terror! This is the priceâ Orra. Which never shall be paid. [Walks from him to the further end of the apartment. Rud. (after a pause). Thou art determin'd, then. Be not so rash: Bethink thee well what flesh and blood can bear: The hour is near at hand. [She, turning round, waves him with her hand to leave her. Thou deignst no answer. Well; reap the fruits of thine unconquer'd pride. [Exit. Manet Orra. Orra. I am alone: that closing door divides me From every being owning nature's life.â And shall I be constrain'd to hold communion With that which owns it not? [After pacing to and fro for a little while. O that my mind Could raise its thoughts in strong and steady fervour To Him, the Lord of all existing things, Who lives, and is where'er existence is; Grasping its hold upon His skirted robe, Beneath whose mighty rule angels and spirits, Demons and nether powers, all living things, Hosts of the earth, with the departed dead In their dark state of mystery, alike Subjected are!âAnd I will strongly do it.â Ah! would I could! Some hidden powerful hindrance Doth hold me back, and mars all thought.â [After a pause, in which she stands fixed with her arms crossed on her breast. Dread intercourse! O! if it look on me with its dead eyes! If it should move its lock'd and earthy lips, And utt'rance give to the grave's hollow sounds! If it stretch forth its cold and bony graspâ O horror, horror! [Sinking lower at every successive idea, as she repeats these four last lines, till she is quite upon her knees on the ground. Would that beneath these planks of senseless matter I could, until the dreadful hour is past, As senseless be! [Striking the floor with her hands. O open and receive me, Ye happy things of still and lifeless being, That to the awful steps which tread upon ye Unconscious are! Enter Cathrina behind her. Who's there? Is't any thing? Cath. 'Tis I, my dearest lady; 'tis Cathrina. Orra (embracing her). How kind! such blessed kindness keep thee by me; I'll hold thee fast; an angel brought thee hither. I needs must weep to think thou art so kind In mine extremity.âWhere wert thou hid? Cath. In that small closet, since the supper hour, I've been conceal'd. For searching round the chamber, I found its door and enter'd. Fear not now, I will not leave thee till the break of day. Orra. Heaven bless thee for it! Till the break of day! The very thought of daybreak gives me life. If but this night were past, I have good hope That noble Theobald will soon be here For my deliv'rance. Cath. Wherefore thinkst thou so? Orra. A stranger, when thou leftst me on the ramparts, Gave me a letter, which I quickly open'd, As soon as I, methought, had gain'd my room In privacy; but close behind me came That demon, Rudigere, and, snatching at it, Forced me to cast it to the flames, from which, I struggling with him still, he could not save it. Cath. You have not read it then? Orra. No; but the seal Was Theobald's, and I could swear ere long He will be here to free me from this thraldom. Cath. God grant he may! Orra. If but this night were past! How goes the time? Has it not enter'd on the midnight watch? Cath. (pointing to a small slab at the corner of the stage on which is placed a sand-glass). That Glass I've set to measure it. As soon As all the sand is run, you are secure; The midnight watch is past. Orra (running to the glass, and looking at it eagerly). There is not much to run; O an't were finish'd! But it so slowly runs! Cath. Yes; watching it, It seemeth slow. But heed it not; the while, I'll tell thee some old tale, and ere I've finish'd, The midnight watch is gone. Sit down, I pray. [They sit, Orra drawing her chair close to Cathrina. What story shall I tell thee? Orra. Something, my friend, which thou thyself hast known, Touching the awful intercourse which spirits With mortal men have held at this dread hour. Didst thou thyself e'er meet with one whose eyes Had look'd upon the spectred deadâhad seen Forms from another world? Cath. Never but once. Orra (eagerly). Once then thou didst. O tell it! tell it me! Cath. Well, since I needs must tell it, once I knew A melancholy man, who did aver, That journeying on a time o'er a wild waste, By a fell storm o'erta'en, he was compell'd To pass the night in a deserted tower, Where a poor hind, the sole inhabitant Of the sad place, prepared for him a bed: And, as he told his tale, at dead of night, By the pale lamp that in his chamber burn'd As it might be an arm's-length from his bedâ Orra. So close upon him? Cath. Yes. Orra. Go on; what saw he? Cath. An upright form, wound in a clotted shroudâ Clotted and stiff, like one swath'd up in haste After a bloody death. Orra. O horrible! Cath. He started from his bed and gazed upon it. Orra. And did he speak to it? Cath. He could not speak. Its visage was uncover'd, and at first Seem'd fix'd and shrunk, like one in coffin'd sleep; But, as he gaz'd, there came, he wist not how, Into its beamless eyes a horrid glare, And turning towards him, for it did moveâ Why dost thou grasp me thus? Orra. Go on, go on! Cath. Nay, heaven forefend! Thy shrunk and sharpen'd features Are of the corse's colour, and thine eyes Are full of tears. How's this? Orra. I know not how. A horrid sympathy jarr'd on my heart, And forced into mine eyes these icy tears. A fearful kindredship there is between The living and the deadâan awful bond! Woe's me! that we do shudder at ourselvesâ At that which we must be!âA dismal thought! Where dost thou run? thy story is not told. [Seeing Cath. go towards the sand-glass. Cath. (showing the glass). A better story I will tell thee now; The midnight watch is past. Orra. Ha! let me see. Cath. There's not one sand to run. Orra. But it is barely past. Cath. 'Tis more than past. For I did set it later than the hour, To be assur'dly sure. Orra. Then it is gone indeed. O heaven be praised! The fearful gloom gone by! [Holding up her hands in gratitude to heaven, and then looking round her with cheerful animation. In truth, already I feel as if I breath'd the morning air; I'm marvellously lighten'd. Cath. Ne'ertheless, Thou art forespent; I'll run to my apartment, And fetch some cordial drops that will revive thee. Orra. Thou needst not go; I've ta'en thy drops already; I'm bold and buoyant grown. [Bounding lightly from the floor. Cath. I'll soon return; Thou art not fearful now? Orra. No; I breathe lightly; Valour within me grows most powerfully, Wouldst thou but stay to see it, gentle Cathrine! Cath. I will return to see it, ere thou canst Three times repeat the letters of thy name. [Exit hastily by the concealed door. Orra. (alone). This burst of courage shrinks most shamefully. I'll follow her.â [Striving to open the door. 'Tis fast; it will not open. I'll count my footsteps as I pace the floor Till she return again. [Paces up and down, muttering to herself, when a horn is heard without, pausing and sounding three times, each time louder than before. [Orra runs again to the door. Despair will give me strength; where is the door? Mine eyes are dark, I cannot find it now. O God! protect me in this awful pass! [After a pause, in which she stands with her body bent in a cowering posture, with her hands locked together, and trembling violently, she starts up and looks wildly round her. There's nothing, yet I felt a chilly hand Upon my shoulder press'd. With open'd eyes And ears intent I'll stand. Better it is Thus to abide the awful visitation, Than cower in blinded horror, strain'd intensely With ev'ry beating of my goaded heart. [Looking round her with a steady sternness, but shrinking again almost immediately. I cannot do it: on this spot I'll hold me In awful stillness. [Bending her body as before; then, after a momentary pause, pressing both her hands upon her head. The icy scalp of fear is on my head; The life stirs in my hair; it is a sense That tells the nearing of unearthly steps, Albeit my ringing ears no sounds distinguish. [Looking round, as if by irresistible impulse, to a great door at the bottom of the stage, which bursts open, and the form of a huntsman, clothed in black, with a horn in his hand, enters and advances towards her. She utters a loud shriek, and falls senseless on the ground. Theo. (running up to her, and raising her from the ground). No semblance, but real agony of fear. Orra, oh, Orra! knowst thou not my voice? Thy knight, thy champion, the devoted Theobald? Open thine eyes and look upon my face: [Unmasking. I am no fearful waker from the grave. Dost thou not feel? 'Tis the warm touch of life. Look up, and fear will vanish.âWords are vain! What a pale countenance of ghastly strength By horror chang'd! O idiot that I was To hazard thisâThe villain hath deceiv'd me: My letter she has ne'er receiv'd. O fool! That I should trust to this! [Beating his head distractedly. Enter Franko, by the same door. Franko. What is the matter? what strange turn is this? Theo. O cursed sanguine fool! could I not thinkâ She moves, she moves!ârouse thee, my gentle Orra! 'Tis no strange voice that calls thee; 'tis thy friend. Franko. She opens now her eyes. Theo. But, oh, that look! Franko. She knows thee not, but gives a stifled groan, And sinks again in stupor. Make no more fruitless lamentation here, But bear her hence: the cool and open air May soon restore her. Let us, while we may, Occasion seize, lest we should be surprised. [Exeunt: Orra borne off in a state of insensibility. ACT V. SCENE I. The great hall of the castle. Enter Rudigere, Cathrina, and Attendants, by different doors. Rud. (to attend.) Return'd again! Is any thing discover'd? Or door or passage, garment dropt in haste, Or footstep's track, or any mark of flight? 1st att. No, by my faith! though we have search'd the castle From its high turret to its deepest vault. Cath. 'Tis vain to trace the marks of trackless feet. If that in truth it hath convey'd her hence, The yawning earth has yielded them a passage, Or else, through rifted roofs, the buoyant air. Rud. Fools! search again. I'll raze the very walls From their foundations, but I will discover If door or pass there be to us unknown. Ho! Gomez, there! [Calling off the stage. He keeps himself aloof: Nor aids the search with true and hearty will. I am betray'dâHo! Gomez, there, I say! He shrinks away: go, drag the villain hither, And let the torture wring confession from him. [A loud knocking heard at the gate. Ha! who seeks entrance at this early hour In such a desert place? Cath. Some hind, perhaps, Who brings intelligence. Heaven grant it be! Enter an armed Vassal. Rud. Ha! one from Aldenberg! what brings thee hither? Vass. (seizing Rud.) Thou art my prisoner. (To attendants.) Upon you peril, Assist me to secure him. Rud. Audacious hind! by what authority Speakst thou such bold commands? Produce thy warrant. Vass. 'Tis at the gate, and such as thou must yield to: Count Hughobert himself, with armed men, A goodly band, his pleasure to enforce. [Secures him. Rud. What sudden freak is this? am I suspected Of aught but true and honourable faith? Vass. Ay, by our holy saints! more than suspected. Thy creature Maurice, whom thou thought'st to bribe With things of seeming value, hath discover'd The cunning fraud; on which his tender conscience, Good soul! did o' the sudden so upbraid him, That to his lord forthwith he made confession Of all the plots against the Lady Orra, In which thy wicked arts had tempted him To take a wicked part. All is discover'd. Cath. (aside). All is discover'd! Where then shall I hide me? (Aloud to vass.) What is discover'd? Vass. Ha! most virtuous lady! Art thou alarm'd? Fear not: the world well knows How good thou art; and to the countess shortly, Who with her lord is near, thou wilt no doubt Give good account of all that thou hast done. Cath. (aside, as she retires in agitation). O heaven forbid! What hole o' th' earth will hide me! [Exit. Enter by the opposite side, Hughobert, Eleanora, Alice, Glottenbal, Urston, Maurice, and Attendants. Hugh. (speaking as he enters). Is he secured? Vass. He is, my lord; behold! [Pointing to Rud. Hugh. (to Rud.) Black, artful traitor! Of a sacred trust, Blindly reposed in thee, the base betrayer For wicked ends; full well upon the ground Mayst thou decline those darkly frowning eyes, And gnaw thy lip in shame. Rud. And rests no shame with him, whose easy faith Entrusts a man unproved; or, having proved him, Lets a poor hireling's unsupported testimony Shake the firm confidence of many years? Hugh. Here the accuser stands; confront him boldly, And spare him not. [Bringing forward Maurice. Maur. (to Rud.) Deny it if thou canst. Thy brazen front, All brazen as it is, denies it not. Rud. (to Maur.) Fool! that of prying curiosity And av'rice art compounded! I in truth Did give to thee a counterfeited treasure To bribe thee to a counterfeited trust; Meet recompense! Ha, ha! Maintain thy tale, For I deny it not. [With careless derision. Maur. O, subtle traitor! Dost thou so varnish it with seeming mirth? Hugh. Sir Rudigere, thou dost, I must confess, Outface him well. But call the Lady Orra; If towards her thou hast thyself comported In honesty, she will declare it freely. (To attendant.) Bring Orra hither. 1st att. Would that we could; last night i' the midnight watch She disappear'd; but whether man or devil Hath borne her hence, in truth we cannot tell. Hugh. O both! Both man and devil together join'd. (To Rud. furiously.) Fiend, villain, murderer! Produce her instantly. Dead or alive, produce thy hapless charge. Rud. Restrain your rage, my lord; I would right gladly Obey you, were it possible: the place, And the mysterious means of her retreat, Are both to me unknown. Hugh. Thou liest! thou liest! Glot. (coming forward). Thou liest, beast, villain, traitor! thinkst thou still To fool us thus? Thou shalt be forced to speak. (To Hugh.) Why lose we time in words when other means Will quickly work? Straight to those pillars bind him, And let each sturdy varlet of your train Inflict correction on him. Maur. Ay, this alone will move him. Hugh. Thou sayst well: By heaven it shall be done! Rud. And will Count Hughobert degrade in me The blood of Aldenberg to shame himself? Hugh. That plea avails thee not; thy spurious birth Gives us full warrant, as thy conduct varies, To reckon thee or noble or debased. (To att.) Straight bind the traitor to the place of shame. [As they are struggling to bind Rud. he gets one of his hands free, and, pulling out a dagger from under his clothes, stabs himself. Rud. Now, take your will of me, and drag my corse Through mire and dust; your shameless fury now Can do me no disgrace. Urston (advancing). Rash, daring, thoughtless wretch! dost thou so close A wicked life in hardy desperation? Rud. Priest, spare thy words: I add not to my sins That of presumption, in pretending now To offer up to heaven the forced repentance Of some short moments for a life of crimes. Urst. My son, thou dost mistake me: let thy heart Confession makeâ Glot. (interrupting Urst.) Yes, dog! Confession make Of what thou'st done with Orra; else I'll spurn thee, And cast thy hateful carcass to the kites. Hugh. (pulling back Glot. as he is going to spurn Rud. with his foot, who is now fallen upon the ground). Nay, nay, forbear; such outrage is unmanly. [Eleanora, who with Alice had retired from the shocking sight of Rudigere, new comes forward to him. El. Oh, Rudigere! thou art a dying man, And we will speak to thee without upbraiding. Confess, I do entreat thee, ere thou goest To thy most awful change, and leave us not In this our horrible uncertainty. Is Orra here conceal'd? Al. Thou hast not slain her? Confession make, and heaven have mercy on thee! Rud. Yes, ladies; with these words of gentle meekness My heart is changed; and that you may perceive How greatly changed, let Glottenbal approach me; Spent am I now, and can but faintly speakâ E'en unto him in token of forgiveness I'll tell what ye desire. El. Thank heaven, thou art so changed! Hugh. (to Glot.) Go to him, boy. [Glottenbal goes to Rudigere, and stooping over him to hear what he has to say, Rudigere, taking a small dagger from his bosom, strikes Glottenbal on the neck. Glot. Oh, he has wounded me!âDetested traitor! Take that and that; would thou hadst still a life For every thrust. [Killing him. Hugh. (alarmed). Ha! has he wounded thee. my son? Glot. A scratch; 'Tis nothing more. He aim'd it at my throat, But had not strength to thrust. Hugh. Thank God, he had not! [A trumpet sounds without. Hark! martial notice of some high approach! (To attendants.) Go to the gate. [Exeunt attendants. El. Who may it be? This castle is remote From every route which armed leaders take. Enter a Servant. Serv. The Banneret of Basle is at the gate. Hugh. Is he in force? Serv. Yes, through the trees his distant bands are seen Some hundreds strong, I guess; though with himself Two followers only come. Enter Hartman attended. Hugh. Forgive me, banneret, if I receive thee With more surprise than courtesy. How is it? Com'st thou in peace? Hart. To you, my lord, I frankly will declare The purpose of my coming: having heard it, It is for you to say if I am come, As much I wish, in peace. (To El.) Countess, your presence much emboldens me To think it so shall be. Hugh. (impatiently). Proceed, I beg. When burghers gentle courtesy affect, It chafes me more than all their sturdy boasting. Hart. Then with a burgher's plainness, Hughobert, I'll try my tale to tell,ânice task I fear! So that it may not gall a baron's pride. Brave Theobald, the lord of Falkenstein, Co-burgher also of our ancient city, Whose cause of course is ours, declares himself The suitor of thy ward, the Lady Orra; And learning that within these walls she is, By thine authority, in durance kept, In his behalf I come to set her free; As an oppressed dame, such service claiming From ev'ry gen'rous knight. What is thy answer? Say, am I come in peace? Wilt thou release her? Hugh. Ah, would I could! In faith thou gall'st me shrewdly. Hart. I've been inform'd of all that now disturbs you, By one who held me waiting at the gate. Until the maid be found, if 'tis your pleasure, Cease enmity. Hugh. Then let it cease. A traitor has deceived me, And there he lies. [Pointing to the body of Rud. Hart. (looking at the body). A ghastly smile of fell malignity On his distorted face death has arrested. [Turning again to Hugh. And has he died, and no confession made? All means that may discover Orra's fate Shut from us? Hugh. Ah! the fiend hath utter'd nothing That could betray his secret. If she livesâ El. Alas, alas! think you he murder'd her? Al. Merciful heaven forefend! Enter a Soldier in haste. Sold. O, I have heard a voice, a dismal voice! Omnes. What hast thou heard? El. What voice? Sold. The Lady Orra's. El. Where? Lead us to the place. Hugh. Where didst thou heart it, soldier? Sold. In a deep-tangled thicket of the wood, Close to a ruin'd wall, o'ergrown with ivy, That marks the ancient outworks of the castle. Hugh. Haste; lead the way. [Exeunt all eagerly, without order, following the soldier, Glottenbal and one attendant excepted. Att. You do not go, my lord? Glot. I'm sick, and strangely dizzy grows my head, And pains shoot from my wound. It is a scratch, But from a devil's fang.âThere's mischief in it. Give me thine arm, and lead me to a couch: I'm very faint. Att. This way, my lord; there is a chamber near. [Exit Glottenbal, Supported by the attendant. SCENE II. The forest near the castle; in front a rocky bank crowned with a ruined wall overgrown with ivy, and the mouth of a cavern shaded with bushes. Enter Franko, conducting Hughobert, Hartman, Eleanora, Alice, and Urston, the Soldier following them. Franko (to Hugh.). This is the entry to our secret haunts. And now, my lord, having inform'd you truly Of the device, well meant, but most unhappy, By which the Lady Orra from her prison By Falkenstein was ta'en, myself, my outlaws, Unhappy menâwho better days have seen, Driv'n to this lawless life by hard necessity, Are on your mercy cast. Hugh. Which shall not fail you, valiant Franko. Much Am I indebted to thee: hadst thou not Of thine own free good will become our guide, As wand'ring here thou foundst us, we had ne'er The spot discover'd; for this honest soldier, A stranger to the forest, sought in vain To thread the tangled path. El. (to Franko). She is not well, thou sayst, and from her swoon Imperfectly recover'd. Franko. When I left her, She so appear'd.âBut enter not, I pray, Till I give notice.âHolla, you within! Come forth and fear no ill. [A shriek heard from the cave. Omnes. What dismal shriek is that? Al. 'Tis Orra's voice. El. No, no! it cannot be! It is some wretch, In maniac's fetters bound. Hart. The horrid thought that bursts into my mind! Forbid it, righteous Heaven! [Running into the cave, he is prevented by Theobald, who rushes out upon him. Theo. Hold, hold! no entry here but o'er my corse, When ye have master'd me. Hart. My Theobald, Dost thou not know thy friends? Theo. Ha! thou, my Hartman! Art thou come to me? Hart. Yes, I am come. What means that look of anguish? She is not dead! Theo. Oh, no! it is not death! Hart. What meanst thou? Is she well? Theo. Her body is. Hart. And not her mind?âOh! direst wreck of all! That noble mind!âBut 'tis some passing seizure, Some powerful movement of a transient nature; It is not madness? Theo. (shrinking from him, and bursting into tears). 'Tis heaven's infliction; let us call it so; Give it no other name. [Covering his face. El. (to Theo.) Nay, do not thus despair: when she beholds us, She'll know her friends, and, by our kindly soothing, Be gradually restored. Al. Let me go to her. Theo. Nay, forbear, I pray thee; I will myself with thee, my worthy Hartman, Go in and lead her forth. [Theobald and Hartman go into the cavern, while those without wait in deep silence, which is only broken once or twice by a scream from the cavern and the sound of Theobald's voice speaking soothingly, till they return, leading forth Orra, with her hair and dress disordered, and the appearance of wild distraction in her gait and countenance. Orra (shrinking back as she comes from under the shade of the trees, &amp;c. and dragging Theobald and Hartman back with her). Come back, come back! The fierce and fiery light! Theo. Shrink not, dear love! it is the light of day. Orra. Have cocks crow'd yet? Theo. Yes; twice I've heard already Their matin sound. Look up to the blue sky; Is it not daylight there? And these green boughs Are fresh and fragrant round thee: every sense Tells thee it is the cheerful early day. Orra. Ay, so it is; day takes his daily turn, Rising between the gulfy dells of night Like whiten'd billows on a gloomy sea; Till glow-worms gleam, and stars peep through the dark, And will-o'-the-wisp his dancing taper light, They will not come again. [Bending her ear to the ground. Hark, hark! Ay, hark! They are all there: I hear their hollow sound Full many a fathom down. Theo. Be still, poor troubled soul! they'll ne'er return: They are for ever gone. Be well assured Thou shalt from henceforth have a cheerful home With crackling faggots on thy midnight fire, Blazing like day around thee; and thy friendsâ Thy living, loving friends still by thy side, To speak to thee and cheer thee.âSee, my Orra! They are beside thee now; dost thou not know them? (Pointing to Eleanora and Alice.) Orra (gazing at them with her hand held up to shade her eyes). No, no! athwart the wav'ring garish light, Things move and seem to be, and yet are nothing. El. (going near her). My gentle Orra! hast thou then forgot me? Dost thou not know my voice? Orra. 'Tis like an old tune to my ear return'd. For there be those, who sit in cheerful halls, And breathe sweet air, and speak with pleasant sounds; And once I liv'd with such; some years gone by; I wot not now how long. Hugh. Keen words that rend my heart!âThou hadst a home, And one whose faith was pledged for thy protection. Urst. Be more composed, my lord, some faint remembrance Returns upon her with the well-known sound Of voices once familiar to her ear. Let Alice sing to her some fav'rite tune, That may lost thoughts recall. [Alice sings an old tune, and Orra, who listens eagerly and gazes on her while she sings, afterwards bursts into a wild laugh. Orra. Ha, ha! the witched air sings for thee bravely. Hoot owls through mantling fog for matin birds? It lures not me. â I know thee well enough: The bones of murder'd men thy measure beat, And fleshless heads nod to thee.âOff, I say! Why are ye here?âThat is the blessed sun. El. Ah, Orra! do not look upon us thus! These are the voices of thy loving friends That speak to thee: this is a friendly hand That presses thine so kindly. [Putting her hand upon Orra's, who gives a loud shriek, and shrinks from her with horror. Hart. O grievous state. (Going up to her.) What terror seizes thee? Orra. Take it away! It was the swathed dead! I know its clammy, chill, and bony touch. [Fixing her eyes fiercely on Eleanora. Come not again; I'm strong and terrible now: Mine eyes have look'd upon all dreadful things; And when the earth yawns, and the hell-blast sounds, I'll 'bide the trooping of unearthly steps With stiff-clench'd, terrible strength. [Holding her clenched hands over her head with an air of grandeur and defiance. Hugh. (beating his breast). A murd'rer is a guiltless wretch to me. Hart. Be patient; 'tis a momentary pitch; Let me encounter it. [Goes up to Orra, and fixes his eyes upon her, which she, after a moment, shrinks from and seeks to avoid, yet still, as if involuntarily, looks at him again. Orra. Take off from me thy strangely-fasten'd eye: I may not look upon thee, yet I must. [Still turning from him, and still snatching a hasty look at him as before. Unfix thy baleful glance: art thou a snake? Something of horrid power within thee dwells. Still, still that powerful eye doth such me in Like a dark eddy to its wheeling core. Spare me! O spare me, being of strange power, And at thy feet my subject head I'll lay! [Kneeling to Hartman and bending her head submissively. El. Alas the piteous sight! to see her thus; The noble generous, playful, stately Orra! Theo. (running to Hartman, and pushing him away with indignation). Out on thy hateful and ungenerous guile! Thinkst thou I'll suffer o'er her wretched state The slightest shadow of a base control? [Raising Orra from the ground. No, rise thou stately flower with rude blasts rent: As honour'd art thou with thy broken stem, And leaflets strew'd, as in thy summer's pride. I've seen thee worshipp'd like a regal dame With every studied form of mark'd devotion, Whilst I in distant silence, scarcely proffer'd E'en a plain soldier's courtesy; but now, No liege-man to his crowned mistress sworn, Bound and devoted is, as I to thee; And he who offers to thy alter'd state The slightest seeming of diminish'd revirence, Must in my bloodâ(To Hartman.) O pardon me, my friend! Thou'st wrung my heart. Hart. Nay, do thou pardon me: I am to blame: Thy nobler heart shall not again be wrung. But what can now be done? O'er such wild ravings There must be some control. Theo. O none! none, none! but gentle sympathy And watchfulness of love. My noble Orra! Wander where'er thou wilt; thy vagrant steps Shall follow'd be by one, who shall not weary, Nor e'er detach him from his hopeless task; Bound to thee now as fairest, gentlest beauty Could ne'er have bound him. Al. See how she gazes on him with a look, Subsiding gradually to softer sadness. Half saying that she knows him. El. There is a kindness in her changing eye. Yes, Orra, 'tis the valiant Theobald, Thy knight and champion, whom thou gazest on. Orra. The brave are like the brave; so should it be. He was a goodly manâa noble knight. (To Theobald.) What is thy name, young soldier?âWoe is me! For prayers of grace are said o'er dying men, Yet they have laid thy clay in unblest earthâ Shame! shame! not with the still'd and holy dead. This shall be rectified; I'll find it out; And masses shall be said for thy repose; Thou shalt not troop with these. El. 'Tis not the dead, 'tis Theobald himself, Alive and well, who standeth by thy side. Orra (looking wildly round). Where, where? All dreadful things are near me. round me, Beneath my feet and in the loaded air. Let him begone! The place is horrible! Baneful to flesh and blood.âThe dreadful blast! Their hounds now yell below i' the centre gulph; They may not rise again till solemn bells Have giv'n the stroke that severs night from morn. El. O rave not thus! Dost thou not know us, Orra? Orra (hastily). Ay, well enough I know ye. Urst. Ha! think ye that she does? El. It is a terrible smile of recognition, If such it be. Hart. Nay, do not thus your restless eye-balls move, But look upon us steadily, sweet Orra. Orra. Away! your faces waver to and fro; I'll know you better in your winding-sheets, When the moon shines upon you. Theo. Give o'er, my friends; you see it is in vain; Her mind within itself holds a dark world Of dismal phantasies and horrid forms! Contend with her no more. Enter an attendant in an abrupt disturbed manner. Att. (to Eleanora, aside). Lady, I bring to you most dismal news: Too grievous for my lord, so suddenly And unprepar'd to hear. El. (aside). What is it? Speak. Att. (aside to El) His son is dead, all swell'd and rack'd withpain; And on the dagger's point, which the sly traitor Still in his stiffen'd grasp retains, foul stains, Like those of limed poison, show full well The wicked cause of his untimely death. Hugh. (overhearing them). Who speaks of death? What didst thou whisper there? How is my son?âWhat look is that thou wearst? He is not dead?âThou dost not speak! O God! I have no son. [After a pause. I am bereft!âBut this! But only him!âHeaven's vengeance deals the stroke. Urst. Heaven oft in mercy smites, e'en when the blow Is most severe. Hugh. I had no other hope. Fell is the stroke, if mercy in it be! Could thisâcould this alone atone my crime? Urst. Submit thy soul to Heaven's all-wise decree. Perhaps his life had blasted more thy hopes Than e'en his grievous end. Hugh. He was not all a father's heart could wish; But, oh! he was my son!âmy only son: My childâthe thing that from his cradle grew, And was before me still.âOh, oh! Oh, oh! [Beating his breast and groaning deeply. Orra (running up to him). Ha! dost thou groan, old man? art thou in trouble? Out on it! though they lay him in the mould, He's near thee still.âI'll tell thee how it is: A hideous burst hath been: the damn'd and holy, The living and the dead, together are In horrid neighbourshipâ'Tis but thin vapour, Floating around thee, makes the wav'ring bound. Pooh! blow it off, and see th' uncurtain'd reach. See! from all points they come; earth casts them up! In grave-clothes swath'd are those but new in death; And there be some half bone, half cased in shreds Of that which flesh hath been; and there be some With wicker'd ribs, through which the darkness scowls. Back, back!âThey close upon us.âOh! the void Of hollow unball'd sockets staring grimly, And lipless jaws that move and clatter round us In mockery of speech!âBack, back, I say! Back, back! [Catching hold of Hughobert and Theobald, and dragging them back with her in all the wild strength of frantic horror, whilst the curtain drops. THE BEACON: A SERIOUS MUSICAL DRAMA, IN TWO ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Ulrick, lord of the island. Ermingard. Bastiani, friend of Ulrick. Garcio, friend of Ermingard. Page. Pope's Legate. Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. Fishermen, singers, attendants of the Legate, &amp;c.WOMEN Aurora. Terentia, a noble lady, and gouvernante to Aurora. Viola, lady attending on Aurora. Edda, lady attending on Aurora. Scene, a small island of the Mediterranean. Time, towards the middle of the 14th century. ACT I. SCENE I. A grove adjoining to a castellated building, part of which only is seen. Several people are discovered near the window of one of its towers who begin to sing as the curtain draws up. Song of several voices. Up! quit thy bower, late wears the hour; Long have the rooks caw'd round thy tower; On flower and tree, loud hums the bee; The wilding kid sports merrily: A day so bright, so fresh, so clear, Shineth when good fortune's near. Up! lady fair, and braid thy hair, And rouse thee in the breezy air; The lulling stream, that sooth'd thy dream, Is dancing in the sunny beam: And hours so sweet, so bright, so gay, Will waft good fortune on its way. Up! time will tell; the friar's bell Its service sound hath chimed well; The aged crone keeps house alone, And reapers to the fields are gone; The active day, so boon and bright, May bring good fortune ere the night. Enter Page. Page. Leave off your morning songs, they come too late; My lady hath been up these two good hours, And hath no heart to listen to your lays! You should have cheer'd her sooner. 1st sing. Her nightly vigils make the evening morn. And thus we reckon'd time. Page. Well, go ye now; Another day she'll hear your carols out. [Exeunt page and singers severally, by the bottom of the stage, while Ulrick and Terentia enter by the front, speaking as they enter. Ul. Thou pleadst in vain: this night shall be the last. Ter. Have patience, noble Ulrick; be assur'd, Hope, lacking nourishment, if left alone, Comes to a natural end. Then let Aurora, Night after night, upon the lofty cliff, Her beacon watch: despondency, ere long, Will steal upon the sad unvaried task. Ul. Sad and unvaried! Ay; to sober minds So doth it seem indeed. I've seen a child, Day after day, to his dead hedgeling bring The wonted mess, prepared against its waking, 'Till from its putrid breast each feather dropt: Or on the edge of a clear stream hold out His rod and baitless line from morn till noon, Eyeing the spotted trout, that past his snare A thousand times hath glided, till by force His angry dame hath dragg'd him from his station. Hope is of such a tough continuous nature, That, waiting thus its natural end, my life Shall to a close wear sadly. Patience, sayst thou! I have too long been patient. Ter. Then be it known to thee, despondency Already steals upon her; for she sits not So oft as she was wont upon the beach, But in her chamber keeps in sombre silence; And when the night is come, less eagerly She now inquires if yet the beacon's light Peer down the woody pass, that to the cliff Nightly conducts her toilsome steps. I guess, Soon of her own accord she'll watch no more. Ul. No, thou unwisely guessest. By that flame I do believe some spirit of the night Comes to her mystic call, and soothes her ear With whisper'd prophecies of good to come. Ter. In truth, my lord, you do yourself talk strangely. These are wild thoughts. Ul. Nay, be thou well assur'd, Spell-bound she is: night hath become her day; On all wild songs, and sounds, and ominous things (Shunning the sober intercourse of friends Such as affliction courts), her ear and fancy Do solely dwell. This visionary state Is foster'd by these nightly watchings; therefore, I say again, I will no more endure it; This night shall be the last. Ter. That Ermingard upon the plains of Palestine Fell on that fatal day, what sober mind Can truly doubt; although his corpse, defaced, Or hid by other slain, was ne'er discover'd. For well I am assured, had he survived it, Knowing thou wert his rival, and Aurora Left in this isle, where thou bearst sov'reign sway, He, with a lover's speed, had hasten'd back. All, whom the havoc of the battle spared, Have to their homes return'd.âThou shak'st thy head, Thou dost not doubt? Ul. We'll speak of this no more. I'm sick and weary of these calculations. We must and will consider him as dead; And let Aurora knowâ Enter Bastiani. (To Bast. angrily.) Why, Bastiani, Intrud'st thou thus, regardless of my state: These petty cares are grown most irksome to me; I cannot hear thee now. Bast. Indeed, my lord, it is no petty care Compels me to intrude. Within your port A vessel from the Holy Land has moor'd. Ul. (starting). Warriors from Palestine? Bast. No, good my lord! The holy legate on his way to Rome; Who by late tempests driven on our coasts, Means here his shatter'd pinnace to refit, And give refreshment to his weary train. Ul. In evil hour he comes to lord it here. Bast. He doth appear a meek and peaceful man. Ul. 'Tis seeming all. I would with mailed foes Far rather in th' embattled plain contend, Than strive with such my peaceful town within. Already landed, sayst thou? Bast. Yes, from the beach their grave procession comes. Between our gazing sight and the bright deep That glows behind them in the western sun, Crosses and spears and croziers show aloft Their darken'd spikes, in most distinct confusion; While grey-cowl'd monks, and purple-stoled priests, And crested chiefs, a closing group below, Motley and garish, yet right solemn too, Move slowly on.â Ul. Then must I haste to meet them. Bast. Or be most strangely wanting in respect. For every street and alley of your city Its eager swarm pours forth to gaze upon them: The very sick and dying, whose wan forms No more did think to meet the breath of heaven, Creep to their doors, and stretch their wither'd arms To catch a benediction. Blushing maids, Made bold by inward sense of sanctity, Come forth with threaded rosaries in their hands To have them by the holy prelate bless'd; And mothers hold their wond'ring infants up, That touch of passing cowl or sacred robe May bring them good. And in fair truth, my lord, Among the crowd the rev'rend legate seems Like a right noble and right gentle parent, Cheering a helpless race. Ul. Ay, 'tis right plain thou art besotted too. Were he less gentle I should fear him less. [Exit. Bast. He's in a blessed mood: what so disturbs him? Ter. What has disturb'd him long, as well thou knowest: Aurora's persevering fond belief That her beloved Ermingard still lives, And will return again. To guide his bark Upon our dang'rous coast, she nightly kindles Her watch-fire, sitting by the lonely flame; For so she promis'd, when he parted from her, To watch for his return. Bast. Ulrick in wisdom should have married them Before he went, for then the chance had been She had not watch'd so long. Your widow is a thing of more docility Than your lorn maiden.âPardon, fair Terentia. Ter. Thy tongue wags freely. Yet I must confess, Had Ulrick done what thou callst wisely, he The very thing had done which as her kinsman He was in duty bound to. But, alas! A wayward passion warp'd him from the right, And made him use his power ungen'rously Their union to prevent. Bast. But though the death of Ermingard were prov'd, Thinkst thou Aurora would bestow her hand On one who has so long her wishes cross'd, A lover cloth'd in stern authority? Ter. I know not; Ulrick fondly so believes; And I, although allied to him by blood, The playmate also of his early days, Dare not an opposite opinion utter. Bast. Hark there! I hear without th' approaching crowd. My duty on this public ceremony I must attend, for honour of the state. In petty courts like this, on such occasions, One spangled doublet more or less bears count. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. An arbour, supported by rustic wooden pillars, twined round with flowers and green plants, and a flowergarden seen in the background between the pillars. Enter Page, followed by Edda, speaking as she enters. Edda. Yes, do so, boy; Aurora is at hand.â But take with thee, beside, this little basket, And gather roses in the farther thicket, Close to the garden-gate.â Page (taking the basket). Give it me then. She chid me yesterday For gath'ring full-spread roses, whose loose leaves Fell on her lap: to-day I'll fill my basket With buds, and blossoms, and half open'd flowers, Such as nice dames do in their kerchiefs place. Edda. Prate less and move thee quicker. Get thee hence. See there, thy mistress comes: haste to thy task. [Exit page. Enter Aurora, and Terentia. Ter. Here you will find a more refreshing air; The western sun beats fiercely. Aur. Western sun! Is time so far advanced? I left my couch Scarcely an hour ago. Ter. You are deceiv'd. Three hours have past, but past by you unheeded; Who have the while in silent stillness been, Like one forlorn, that has no need of time. Aur. In truth I now but little have to do With time or any thing besides. It passes; Hour follows hour; day follows day; and year, If I so long shall last, will follow year: Like drops that through the cavern'd hermit's roof Some cold spring filters; glancing on his eye At measur'd intervals, but moving not His fix'd unvaried notice. Edda. Nay, dearest lady, be not so depress'd. You have not ask'd me for my song to-dayâ The song you prais'd so much. Shall I not sing it? I do but wait your bidding. Aur. I thank thy kindness; sing it if thou wilt. [Sits down on a low seat, her head supported between both her hands, with her elbows resting on her knees. SONG. Where distant billows meet the sky, A pale, dull light the seamen spy, As spent they stand and tempest-tost, Their vessel struck, their rudder lost; While distant homes where kinsmen weep, And graves full many a fathom deep, By turns their fitful, gloomy thoughts pourtray: â'Tis some delusion of the sight, Some northern streamer's paly light.â âFools!â saith rous'd Hope with gen'rous scorn, âIt is the blessed peep of morn, And aid and safety come when comes the day.â And so it is; the gradual shine Spreads o'er heaven's verge its lengthen'd line: Cloud after cloud begins to glow And tint the changeful deep below; Now sombre red, now amber bright, Till upward breaks the blazing light; Like floating fire the gleamy billows burn: Far distant on the ruddy tide, A black'ning sail is seen to glide; Loud bursts their eager joyful cry, Their hoisted signal waves on high, And life, and strength, and happy thoughts return. Ter. Is not her voice improv'd in power and sweetness? Edda. It is a cheering song. Aur. It cheers those who are cheer'd. [After a pause. Twelve years are past; Their daughters matrons grown, their infants youths, And they themselves with aged furrows mark'd; But none of all their kin are yet return'd; No, nor shall ever. Ter. Still run thy thoughts upon those hapless women Of that small hamlet, whose advent'rous peasants To Palestine with noble Baldwin went, And ne'er were heard of more? Aur. They perish'd there; and of their dismal fate No trace remain'dânone of them all return'd. Didst thou not say so?âHusbands, lovers, friends, Not one return'd again. Ter. So I believe. Aur. Thou but believest then? Ter. As I was toldâ Edda. Thou hast the story wrong. Four years gone by, one did return again; But marr'd, and maim'd, and chang'dâa woeful man. Aur. And what though every limb were hack'd and maim'd, And roughen'd o'er with scars?âhe did return. [Rising lightly from her seat. I would a pilgrimage to Iceland go, To the antipodes or burning zone, To see that man who did return again, And her who did receive him.âDid receive him.! O what a moving thought lurks here!âHow was't? Tell it me all: and oh, another time, Give me your tale ungarbled.â Enter Viola. Ha, Viola! 'tis my first sight of thee Since our long vigil. Thou hast had, I hope, A sound and kindly sleep. Viola. Kindly enough, but somewhat cross'd with dreams. Aur. How cross'd? what was thy dream? O tell it me! I have an ear that craves for every thing That hath the smallest sign or omen in it. It was not sad? Viola. Nay, rather strange; methought A christ'ning feast within your bower was held; But when the infant to the font was brought, It prov'd a full-grown man in armour clad. Aur. A full-grown man! (Considering for a moment, and then holding up her hands.)O blessing on thy dream! From death to life restor'd is joyful birth. It is, it is! come to my heart, sweet maid, [Embracing Viola. A blessing on thyself and on thy sleep! I feel a kindling life within me stir, That doth assure me it has shadow'd forth A joy that soon shall be. Ter. So may it prove! But trust not such vain fancies, nor appear Too much elated; for unhappy Ulrick Swears that your beacon, after this night's watch, Shall burn no more. Aur. He does! then will we have A noble fire. This night our lofty blaze Shall through the darkness shoot full many a league Its streamy rays, like to a bearded star Preceding changefulâay, and better times. It may in very truth. O if his bark (For many a bark within their widen'd reach The dark seas traverse) should our light descry! Should this be soâit may; perhaps it will. O that it might!âWe'll have a rousing blaze! Give me your hands. [Taking Viola and Terentia gaily by the hands. So lightly bounds my heart, I could like midnight goblins round the flame Unruly orgies hold.âHa! think ye not, When to the font our mail-clad infant comes, Ulrick will a right gracious gossip prove? Viola. Assuredly, so will his honour prompt. Aur. Nay, rather say his pride. Methinks I see him; His darken'd figure striding 'cross the hall, While his high plume, that noddeth to and fro, Show'th his perturb'd and restless courtesy. Good, noble, happy wight! Yet woe betide The luckless hound that fawns on him that day! His dismal yell disturbs the ceremony. Ha, ha! I needs must laugh. Ter. Indeed you let your fancy wildly run, And disappointment will but prove the sharper. Aur. Talk not of disappointment; be assur'd Some late intelligence hath Ulrick prompted To these stern orders. On our sea there sails, Or soon will sail, some vessel, which right gladly He would permit to founder on the coast, Or miss its course. But no, it will not be: In spite of all his hatred, to the shore, Through seas as dark as subterraneous night, It will arrive in safety. Ter. Nay, sweet Aurora, feed not thus thy wishes With wild unlikely thoughts; for Ulrick surely No such intelligence hath had, and thou But makest thy after-sorrow more acute, When these vain fancies fail. Aur. And let them fail: though duller thoughts succeed, The bliss e'en of a moment still is bliss. Viola (to Ter.) Thou wouldst not of her dewdrops spoil the thorn, Because her glory will not last till noon; Nor still the lightsome gambols of the colt, Whose neck to-morrow's yoke will gall. Fye on't! If this be wise, 'tis cruel. Aur. Thanks, gentle Viola; thou art ever kind. We'll think to-morrow still hath good in store, And make of this a blessing for to-day, Though good Terentia there may chide us for it. Ter. And thus a profitable life you'll lead, Which hath no present time, but is made up Entirely of to-morrows. Aur. Well, taunt me as thou wilt, I'll worship still The blessed morrow, storehouse of all good For wretched folks. They who lament to-day, May then rejoice: they who in misery bend E'en to the earth, be then in honour robed. O! who shall reckon what its brighten'd hours May of returning joy contain? To-morrow! The blest to-morrow! cheering, kind to-morrow! I were a heathen not to worship thee. (To Ter.) Frown not again; we must not wrangle now. Ter. Thou dost such vain and foolish fancies cherish, Thou forcest me to seem unkind and stern. Aur. Ah! be not stern. Edda will sing the song That makes feet beat and heads nod to its tune; And even grave Terentia will be moved To think of pleasant things. SONG. Wish'd-for gales, the light vane veering, Better dreams the dull night cheering, Lighter heart the morning greeting, Things of better omen meeting! Eyes each passing stranger watching, Ears each feeble rumour catching Say he existeth still on earthly ground, The absent will return, the long, long lost be found. In the tower the ward-bell ringing, In the court the carols singing, Busy hands the gay board dressing, Eager steps the threshold pressing, Open'd arms in haste advancing, Joyful looks through blind tears glancing, The gladsome bounding of his aged hound, Say he in truth is here, our long, long lost is found. Hymned thanks and beadsmen praying, With sheath'd sword the urchin playing, Blazon'd hall with torches burning, Cheerful morn in peace returning, Converse sweet that strangely borrows Present bliss from former sorrows; O who can tell each blessed sight and sound That says, he with us bides, our long, long lost is found. Aur. (who at first nods her head lightly to the measure, now bursts into tears, taking Edda's hands between hers, and pressing them gratefully). I thank thee: this shall be our daily song: It cheers my heart, although these foolish tears Seem to disgrace its sweetness. Enter Page. Viola (to Aur.) Here comes your page with lightly-bounding steps, As if he brought good tidings. Edda. Grant he may! Aur. (eagerly). What brings thee hither, boy? Page (to Aur.). A noble stranger of the legate's train, Come from the Holy Land, doth wait without, Near to the garden gate, where I have left him; He begs to be admitted to your presence; Pleading for such indulgence as the friend Of Ermingard, for so he bade me say. Aur. The friend of Ermingard! the Holy Land! [Pausing for a moment, and then tossing up her arms in ecstasy. O God! it is himself! [Runs eagerly some steps towards the garden, then catching hold of Terentia, who follows her. My head is dizzy grown; I cannot go. Haste, lead him hither, boy. [Waving her hand impatiently. Fly; hearst thou not? [Exit page. Ter. Be not so greatly moved. It is not likely This should be Ermingard. The boy has seen him, And would have known him. 'Tis belike some friend. Aur. No; every thrilling fibre of my frame Cries out âit is himself.â [Looking out. He comes not yet: how strange! how dull! how tardy! Ter. Your page hath scarce had time to reach the gate, Though he hath run right quickly. Aur. (pausing and looking out). He comes not yet. Ah! if it be not he; My sinking heart misgives me. O now he comes! the size and air are his. Ter. Not to my fancy; there is no resemblance. Aur. Nay, but there is: and see, he wears his cloak As he was wont to do; and o'er his cap The shading plume so hangs.âIt is! it is! Enter Garcio; and she, breaking from Terentia, runs towards him. My lost, my found, my blest! conceal thee not. [Going to catch him in her arms, when Garcio takes off his plumed cap, and bows profoundly. She utters a faint cry, and shrinks back. Gar. Lady, I see this doffed cap hath discover'd A face less welcome than the one you looked for. Pardon a stranger's presence; I've presumed Thus to intrude, as friend of Ermingard, Who bade meâ Aur. Bade thee! is he then at hand? Gar. Ah, would he were! 'Twas in a hostile and a distant land He did commit to me these precious tokens, Desiring me to give them to Aurora, And with them too his sad and last farewell. Aur. And he is dead! Gar. Nay, wring not thus your hands: He was alive and well when he entrusted me With what I now return. [Offering her a small casket. Aur. Alive and well, and sends me back my tokens! Gar. He sent them back to thee as Ulrick's wife; For such, forced by intelligence from hence Of strong authority, he did believe thee: And in that fatal fight, which shortly follow'd, He fought for death as shrewdly as for fame. Fame he indeed hath earn'd. Aur. But not the other? Ah, do not say he has! Among the slain His body was not found. Gar. As we have learnt, the Knights of blest St. John Did from the field of dying and of wounded Many convey, who in their house of charity All care and solace had; but with the names, Recorded as within their walls receiv'd, His is not found; therefore we must account him With those who, shrouded in an unknown fate, Are as the dead lamented, as the dead For ever from our worldly care dismiss'd. Aur. Lamented he shall be; but from my care Dismiss'd as are the deadâthat is impossible. Ter. Nay, listen to advice so wise and needful: It is the friend of Ermingard who says, Let him within thy mind be as the dead. Aur. My heart repels the thought; it cannot be. No, till his corse, bereft of life, is found, Till this is sworn, and prov'd, and witness'd to me, Within my breast he shall be living still. Ter. Wilt thou yet vainly watch night after night, To guide his bark who never will return? Aur. Who never will return! And thinkest thou To bear me down with such presumptuous words? Heaven makes me strong against thee: There is a Power above that calms the storm, Restrains the mighty, gives the dead to life: I will in humble faith my watch still keep; Force only shall restrain me. Gar. Force never shall, thou noble, ardent spirit! Thy gen'rous confidence would almost tempt me To think it will be justified. Aur. Ha! sayst thou so? A blessing rest upon thee For these most cheering words! Some guardian power Whispers within thee.âNo, we'll not despair. Enter Ulrick. Ul. (to Gar.) Your dismal mission is, I trust, fulfill'd; Then, gentle Garcio, deem it not unkind That I entreat you to retire; for they Who sorrow for the dead, love to be left To grieve without constraint. Aur. Thanks for your kind concern, most noble sir; And when we needs must sorrow for the dead, We'll freely grieve without constraint. But know, Until our corse is found, we ring no knell. If then your ear for funeral dirges long, Go to some other bower; hope still is here. Ul. Ha! still perversely bent? what can convince thee? This is distraction. Aur. Be it what it may, It owns not thy authority. Brave youth (to Gar.), I owe thy gentleness some kind acknowledgment: I'll find another time to give thee thanks. [Exit, followed by Viola and Edda. Ul. Such hope is madness! yield we to her humour? No, she must be to sober reason brought, By steady, firm control. Gar. Mean you by this, my lord, a fore'd control? Ul. Who shall inquire my meaning? Gar. The holy legate, patron of th' oppress'd, Will venture to inquire. Ul. Ay, as his nephew, thou presum'st, I see. But know, bold youth, I am unused to threats. Gar. Yet brook them as you may. I take my leave. [Exit. Manent Ulrick and Terentia. Ul. Did I not say these cursed meddling priestsâ These men of meekness, wheresoe'er they come, Would rule and power usurp? Woe worth the hour That brought them here!âand for this headstrong maniac. As such, I willâ Ter. Hush, hush! these precincts quit. It is not well, here to expose to view Thy weak ungovern'd passions. Thou'rt observ'd; Retire with me, where screen'd from ev'ry eye, With more possession of thy ruffled mind, Thou mayst consider of thy wayward state. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. A flat spot of ground on the top of a cliff, with broken craggy rocks on each side, and a large mass of rock in the middle, on which a great fire of wood is burning; a dark sea in the background; the scene to receive no light but from the fire. Two fishermen are discovered watching the fire, and supplying it with wood. SONG.1st Fisherman. âHigh is the tower, and the watch-dogs bay, And the flitting owlets shriek; I see thee wave thy mantle grey, But I cannot hear thee speak. âO, are they from the east or west, The tidings he bears to me? Or from the land that I love best, From the knight of the north countree?â Swift down the winding stair she rush'd, Like a gust of the summer wind; Her steps were light, her breath was hush'd, And she dared not look behind. She pass'd by stealth the narrow door, The postern way also, And thought each bush her robe that tore, The grasp of a warding foe. And she has climb'd the moat so steep, With chilly dread and fear, While th' evening fly humm'd dull and deep, Like a wardman whisp'ring near. âNow, who art thou, thou Palmer tall, Who beckonest so to me? Art thou from that dear and distant hall? Art thou from the north countree?â He rais'd his hood with wary wile, That cover'd his raven hair, And a manlier face and a sweeter smile Ne'er greeted lady fair. âMy coal-black steed feeds in the brake, Of gen'rous blood and true; He'll soon the nearest frontier make, Let they who list pursue. âThy pale cheek shows an alter'd mind, Thine eye the blinding tear; Come not with me if aught behind Is to thy heart more dear. âThy sire and dame are in that hall, Thy friend, thy mother's son; Come not with me, if one o'them all, E'er lov'd thee as I have done.â The lady mounted the coal-black steed, Behind her knight I ween, And they have pass'd through brake and mead, And plain, and woodland green. But hark, behind! the warders shout, And the hasty larums ring; And the mingled sound of a gath'ring rout The passing air doth bring. O noble steed! now 'quit thee well, And prove thy gen'rous kind! That fearful sound doth louder swell, It is not far behind. âThe frontier's nearâa span the plain, Press on and do not fail! Ah! on our steps fell horsemen gain, I hear their ringing mail.â 2d fish. Tush, man! give o'er; thy ballads have no end, When thou art in the mood. I hear below A sound of many voices on the shore: Some boat, belike, forced by the drifting current Upon the rocks, may be in jeopardy. 1st fish. 'Tis all a mock to cut my ditty short. Thou hast no mind to hear how it befell That those two lovers were by kinsmen stern O'erta'en; and how the knight,âby armed foes Beset, a bloody combat bravely held, And was the while robb'd of his lady fair. And how in Paynim land they met again. How, as a page disguised, she sought her knight, Left on the field as lifeless. How she cheer'd him; And how they married were, and home in stateâ 2d fish. Ha' done, ha' done! a hundred times I've heard it. My grandam lull'd me with it on her lap Full many a night; and as my father sat, Mending his nets upon the beach, he sang it. I would I knew my prayers as well.âBut hark! I hear a noise again.â [Goes to the bottom of the stage, as if he were looking down to the sea. Along the shore I see lights moving swiftly. 1st fish. Some fishermen, who, later than the rest, Their crazy boat bring in; while, to the beach, With flaming brands, their wives and children run. Rare sight, indeed, to take thy fancy so! (Sings again.) No fish stir in our heaving net, And the sky is dark, and the night is wet; And we must ply the lusty oar, For the tide is ebbing from the shore; And sad are they whose fagots burn, So kindly stored for our return. Our boat is small and the tempest raves, And nought is heard but the lashing waves, And the sullen roar of the angry sea, And the wild winds piping drearily; Yet sea and tempest rise in vain, We'll bless our blazing hearths again Push bravely, mates! Our guiding star Now from its towerlet streameth far. And now along the nearing strand, See, swiftly moves yon flaming brand: Before the midnight watch be past, We'll quaff our bowl and mock the blast. Bast. (without). Holla, good mate! Thou who so bravely singst! Come down, I pray thee. 1st fish. Who art thou who callst? 2d fish. I know the voice; 'tis Signor Bastiani. 1st fish. What! he, at such an hour, upon the cliff! (Calling down.) I cannot come. If, from my station here, This fire untended, I were found; good sooth! I had as lief the luckless friar be, Who spilt the abbot's wine. 2d fish. I'll go to him. [Exit. 1st fish. (muttering to himself). Ay; leave my watch, indeed! a rare entreaty! Enter Bastiani. Bast. Wilt thou not go? A boat near to the shore, In a most perilous state, calls for assistance: Who is like thee, good Stephen, bold and skilful? Haste to its aid, if there be pity in thee, Or any Christian grace. I will, meantime, Thy beacon watch; and should the lady come, Excuse thy absence. Haste; make no reply. 1st fish. I will; God help us all! [Exit. Bast. Here is, indeed, a splendid noble fire Left me in ward. It makes the darkness round, To its fierce light oppos'd, seem thick and palpable, And closed o'er head, like to the pitchy cope Of some vast cavern.âNear at hand, methinks, Soft female voices speak: I'll to my station. [Retires from the front of the stage behind the fire. Enter Aurora, Terentia and Viola. Viola. A rousing light! Good Stephen hath full well Obey'd your earnest bidding.âFays and witches Might round its blaze their midnight revelry Right fitly keep. Ter. Ay; thou lov'st wilds and darkness, And fire and storms, and things unsooth and strange: This suits thee well. Methinks, in gazing on it, Thy face a witch-like cagerness assumes. Viola. I'll be a goblin then, and round it dance. Did not Aurora say we thus should hold This nightly vigil. Yea, such were her words. Aur. They were light bubbles of some mantling thought, That now is flat and spiritless; and yet, If thou art so inclin'd, ask not my leave, Dance if thou wilt. Viola. Nay, not alone, sweet sooth! Witches, themselves, some fiend-like partners find. Ter. And so mayst thou. Look yonder; near the flame A crested figure stands. That is not Stephen. Aur. (eagerly). A crested figure! Where? O call to it! [Bast. comes forward. Ter. 'Tis Bastiani. Aur. Ay; 'tis Bastiani: 'Tis he, or any one; 'tis ever thus; So is my fancy mock'd. Bast. If I offend you, madam, 'tis unwillingly Stephen has for awhile gone to the beach, To help some fishermen, who, as I guess, Against the tide would force their boat to land. He'll soon return; meantime, I did entreat him To let me watch his beacon. Pardon me; I had not else intruded; though full oft I've clamber'd o'er these cliffs, e'en at this hour, To see the ocean from its sabled breast The flickering gleam of these bright flames return. Aur. Make no excuse, I pray thee. I am told By good Terentia thou dost wish me well, Though Ulrick long has been thy friend. I know A wanderer on the seas in early youth Thou wast, and still canst feel for all storm-toss'd On that rude element. Bast. 'Tis true, fair lady: I have been, ere now, Where such a warning light, sent from the shore, Had saved some precious lives; which makes the task, I now fulfil, more grateful. Aur. How many leagues from shore may such a light By the benighted mariner be seen? Bast. Some six or so, he will descry it faintly, Like a small star, or hermit's taper, peering From some cav'd rock that brows the dreary waste; Or like the lamp of some lone lazar-house, Which through the silent night the traveller spies Upon his doubtful way. Viola. Fie on such images! Thou shouldst have liken'd it to things more seemly. Thou mightst have said the peasant's evening fire That from his upland cot, through winter's gloom, What time his wife their evening meal prepares, Blinks on the traveller's eye, and cheers his heart; Or signal-torch, that from my lady's bower Tells wand'ring knights the revels are begun; Or blazing brand, that from the vintage-house O' long October nights, through the still air Looks rousingly.âTo have our gallant beacon Ta'en for a lazar-house! Bast. Well, maiden, as thou wilt: thy gentle mistress Of all these things may choose what likes her best, To paint more clearly how her noble fire The distant seamen cheer'd, who bless the while The hand that kindled it. Aur. Shall I be bless'dâ By wand'ring men returning to their homes? By those from shipwreck sav'd, again to cheer Their wives, their friends, their kindred? Bless'd by those! And shall it not a blessing call from heaven? It will; my heart leaps at the very thought: The seamen's blessing rests upon my head, To charm my wand'rer home.â Heap on more wood: Let it more brightly blaze.âGood Bastiani, Hie to thy task, and we'll assist thee gladly. [As they begin to occupy themselves with the fire, the sound of distant voices, singing in harmony, is heard under the stage as if ascending the cliff. Aur. What may it be? Viola. The songs of Paradise, But that our savage rocks and gloomy night So ill agree with peaceful soothing bliss. Ter. No blessed spirits in these evil days Hymn, through the stilly darkness, strains of grace. Aur. Nay, list; it comes again. [Voices heard nearer. Ter. The mingled sound comes nearer, and betrays Voices of mortal men. Viola. In such sweet harmony! I never heard the like. Aur. They must be good and holy who can utter Such heavenly sounds. Bast. I've surely heard before This solemn chorus chaunted by the knights, The holy brothers of Jerusalem. It is a carol sung by them full oft, When saved from peril dire of flood or field. Aur. The Knights of blest St. John from Palestine! Alas! why feel I thus? knowing too well They cannot bring the tidings I would hear. [Chorus rises again very near. Viola. List, list! they've gain'd the summit of the cliff: They are at hand; their voices are distinct; Yea, e'en the words they sing. [A solemn song or hymn, sung in harmony, heard without. Men preserv'd from storm and tide, And fire and battle, raging wide; What shall subdue our steady faith, Or of our heads a hair shall scath? Men preserv'd, in gladness weeping, Praise Him, who hath alway our souls in holy keeping. And wheresoe'er in earth or sea Our spot of rest at last shall be; Our swords in many a glorious field, Surviving heroes still shall wield, While we our faithful meed are reaping With Him, who hath alway our souls in holy keeping. Enter six Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in procession, with their followers behind them, who do not advance upon the stage, but remain partly concealed behind the rocks. Aur. Speak to them, Bastiani; thou'rt a soldier; Thy mind is more composed.âI pray thee do. [Motioning Bast. to accost them. Bast. This lady, noble warriors, greets you all, And offers you such hospitality As this late hour and scanty means afford. Will't please ye round this blazing fire to rest? After such perilous tossing on the waves, You needs must be forspent. 1st knight. We thank you, sir, and this most noble dame, Whose beacon hath from shipwreck sav'd us. Driven By adverse winds too near your rocky coast, Warn'd by its friendly light, we stood to sea: But soon discov'ring that our crazy bark Had sprung a dangerous leak, we took our boat And made for shore. The nearest point of land Beneath this cliff, with peril imminent, By help of some good fishermen we gain'd; And here, in God's good mercy, safe we are With grateful hearts. Aur. We praise that mercy also Which hath preserv'd you. 1st knight. Lady, take our thanks. And may the vessel of that friend beloved, For whom you watch, as we have now been told, Soon to your shore its welcome freight convey! Aur. Thanks for the wish; and may its prayers be heard! Renowned men ye are; holy and brave; In every field of honour and of arms Some of your noble brotherhood are found: Perhaps the valiant knights I now behold, Did on that luckless day against the Souldan With brave De Villeneuve for the cross contend. If this be so, you can, perhaps, inform me Of one who in the battle fought, whose fate Is still unknown. 1st knight. None of us all, fair dame, so honour'd were As in that field to be, save this young knight. Sir Bertram, wherefore, in thy mantle wrapt, Standst thou so far behind? Speak to him, lady: For in that battle he right nobly fought, And may, belike, wot of the friend you mention'd. Aur. (going up eagerly to the young knight). Didst thou there fight? then surely thou didst know The noble Ermingard, who from this isle With valiant Conrad went:â What fate had he upon that dismal day? Young knight. Whate'er his fate in that fell fight might be, He now is as the dead. Aur. Is as the dead! ha! then he is not dead: He's living still. O tell meâtell me this! Say he is still alive; and though he breathe In the foul pest-house; though a wretched wand'rer, Wounded and maim'd; yea, though his noble form With chains and stripes and slavery be disgraced, Say he is living still, and I will bless thee. Thou knowstâfull well thou knowst, but wilt not speak. What means that heavy groan? For love of God, speak to me! [Tears the mantle from his face, with which he had concealed it. My Ermingard! My blessed Ermingard! Thy very living self restored again! Why turn from me? Er. Ah! callst thou this restor'd? Aur. Do I not grasp thy real living hand? Dear, dear!âso dear! most dear!âmy lost, my found! Thou turnst and weepst; art thou not so to me? Er. Ah! would I were! alas, alas, I'm lost: Sever'd from thee for ever. Aur. How so? What mean such words? Er. (shaking his head, and pointing to the cross on his mantle). Look on this emblem of a holy vow, Which binds and weds me to a heavenly love: We are, my sweet Aurora, far divided; Out bliss is wreck'd for ever. Aur. No; thou art still alive, and that is bliss. Few moments since, what would I not have sacrificed, To know that in the lapse of many years I should again behold thee?âI had beenâ How strongly thou art moved!âThou heedst me not. Ter. (to Aur.) Were it not better he should leave this spot? Let me conduct him to my quiet bower. Rest and retirement may compose his mind. Aur. Ay, thou art right, Terentia. Ter. (to the other knights). Noble knights, And these your followers! gentle Bastiani Will to a place of better comfort lead you, Where ye shall find some hospitable cheer, And couches for repose.âHave we your leave That your companion be a little time Ta'en from your company? 1st knight. You have, good lady, Most readily we grant it.âHeaven be with you, And this your lovely charge! (To Bast.) Sir, to your guidance We yield ourselves right gladly. [Exeunt knights, &amp;c., by a path between the rocks, and Aurora and Ermingard, &amp;c., by another path. SCENE II. An ante-room in the house of Aurora. Enter Garcio, beckoning the page, who presently enters by the opposite side. Gar. Come hither, little friend, who didst before Serve me so willingly. Wilt thou from me Bear to Sir Ermingard a friendly message; And say his old companionâ Page. Nay, I dare not. The holy legate and the pope besides Might not disturb him now; for dame Terentia Hath so decreed. He is in her apartment, And yonder is the door. [Pointing off the stage. Gar. From which e'en now I saw thee turn? Page. I listen'd not for harm. Gar. Do I accuse thee, boy? Is he alone? Or is thy lady with him? Page. That I know not. Do folks groan heaviest when they are alone? Gar. Full oft they do; for then without restraint They utter what they feel. Page. Then, by my beard, I think he be alone! For as I slipp'd on tiptoe to the door, I heard him groan so deeply! Gar. Thou heardst him groan? Page. Ay; deeply. I thought when he return'd, we should be merry: So starting up at the good tidings, quickly, All darkling as I was, I donn'd my clothes: But, by my beard! I'd go to bed again, Did I not long most curiously to know What will betide. Gar. Speak softly, boy; thou, and thy beard to boot, Will badly fare if Ulrick should o'erhear thee. I know his angry voice: he is at hand. Page. Where shall I go?âHe will not tarry here: He will but pass to the adjoining hall. In this dark nook I'll hide me from his sight, Lest he should chide me. [Retires behind the pillar. Gar. Is there room for me? He'll greet me too with little courtesy, If I remain to front him. [Retires behind the pillar also. Enter Ulrick and Bastiani, speaking as they anter. Ul. And still thou sayst, forbear! Bast. Pass on, my lord. Ul. No, by the holy rood! I'll keep in sight Of that accursed door which gave him entrance. An hour's sand well hath run, which undisturb'd They have in converse or endearments spent. And yet I must forbear! Bast. They have not told the truth who told you so; It is not yet so long. Ul. It is! it is! I have within these walls, who for my service More faithfully have watch'd than Bastianiâ Ay, or Terentia either. Bast. Wrong us not. Since Ermingard returns by holy vows So bound, that as a rival to your love, You may, with honest thoughts of her you love, No more consider him; all jealousy Within your noble breast should be extinct. Then think not to disturb these few short moments Of unavailing sorrow; that were cruel. Ul. Thou pitiest others well; I am tormented, And no one pities me.âThat cursed beacon! I said in vain this night should be the last: It was a night too much: the sea had now Roll'd o'er his lifeless corse; I, been at peace. Bast. For mercy, good my lord! curb such fell thoughts: They bear no kindred to your better nature. Ul. My better nature! Mock me not with words; Who loves like me, no nature hath but one, And that so keenâWould the engulfing waves Had fifty fathom deep entombed him! Bast. Speak not so loud: pass on; we are within The observation of a prying household. Pass on, and presently I'll bring you notice Of what you would. I pray you, stop not here! [Exeunt Ul. and Bast., while Gar. and page come from their concealment. Page. He would have chid me shrewdly. Gar. He is, indeed, an angry, ruthless man, And Bastiani no slight task will have To keep his wrath from mischief. To the legate I'll hie me straight, and ask his better counsel: So far thee well, sweet child. Page. Nay, take me with you; I'm afraid to stay. I can my prayers and Ave-Maria say, The legate will not chide me. Gar. Nay, stay behind; thou art secure, poor elf! I'll soon return again. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The apartment of Terentia: Ermingard and Aurora are discovered with Terentia, who is withdrawn to a distance from them. Ermingard is seated with his body thrown back, and his face covered with both his hands, while Aurora stands by him in the attitude of one who is entreating or soothing him. Erm. O cease! Thy words, thy voice, thy hand on mine, That touch so dearly felt, do but enhance An agony too great.âUntoward fate! Thus to have lost thee! Aur. Say not, thou hast lost me. Heaven will subdue our minds, and we shall still, With what is spared us from our wreck of bliss, Be happy. Erm. Most unblest, untoward fate! After that hapless battle, where in vain I courted death, I kept my name conceal'd. E'en brave De Villeneuve, master of our Order, When he received my vows, did pledge his faith Not to declare it. Thus I kept myself From all communication with these shores, Perversely forwarding my rival's will. O blind and credulous fool! Aur. Nay, do not thus upbraid thyself: Heaven will'd it. Be not so keenly moved: there still is left What to the soul is dear.âWe'll still be happy. Erm. The chasten'd pilgrim o'er his lady's grave Sweet tears may shed, and may without reproach Thoughts of his past love blend with thoughts of heaven. He whom the treach'ry of some faithless maid Hath robb'd of bliss, may, in the sturdy pride Of a wrong'd man, the galling ill endure; But sever'd thus from thee, so true, so noble, By vows that all the soul's devotion claim, It makes me feelâmay God forgive the crime! A very hatred of all saintly things. Foolârash and credulous fool! to lose thee thus! Aur. Nay, say not so: thou still art mine. Short while, I would have given my whole of life besides To've seen but once again thy passing formâ Thy faceâthine eyes turn'd on me for a moment; Or only to have heard through the still air Thy voice distinctly call me, or the sound Of thy known steps upon my lonely floor: And shall I then, holding thy living hand In love and honour, say, thou art not mine? Erm. (shaking his head). This stateâthis sacred badge! Aur. O no! that holy cross upon thy breast Throws such a charm of valorous sanctity O'er thy lov'd form: my thoughts do forward glance To deeds of such high fame by thee achieved; That e'en methinks the bliss of wedded love Less dear, less noble is, than such strong bonds As may, without reproach, unite us still. Erm. O creature of a gen'rous constancy! Thou but the more distractest me! Fool, fool! [Starting from his seat, and pacing to and fro distractedly. Mean, misbelieving fool!âI thought her false, Credulous alone of evilâI have lost, And have deserv'd to lose her. Aur. Oh! be not thus! Have I no power to soothe thee? See, good Terentia weeps, and fain would try To speak thee comfort. Ter. (coming forward). Ay; bethink thee well, Most noble Ermingard, heaven grants thee still All that is truly precious of her love,â Her true and dear regard. Erm. Then heaven forgive my black ingratitude, For I am most unthankful! Ter. Nay, consider, Her heart is thine: you are in mind united. Erm. United! In the farthest nook o' th' earth I may in lonely solitude reflect, That in some spotâsome happier land she lives, And thinks of me. Is this to be united? Aur. I cannot, in a page's surtout clad, Thy steps attend as other maids have done To other knights. Erm. No, by the holy rood! Thou canst not, and thou shouldst not. Rather would I, Dear as thou art, weep o'er thee in thy grave, Than see thee so degraded. Aur. Hear me out. I cannot so attend theeânoon and eve Thy near companion be! but I have heard That near the sacred houses of your order, Convents of maids devout in Holy Land Establish'd areâmaids who in deeds of charity To pilgrims and to all in warfare maim'd, In sacred warfare for the holy cross, Are deem'd the humble partners of your zeal. Erm. Ay, such there are; but what availeth this? Aur. There will I dwell, a vow'd and humble sister. We shall not far be sever'd. The same winds That do o' nights through your still cloisters sigh, Our quiet cells visiting with mournful harmony, Shall lull my pillow too. Our window'd towers Shall sometimes show me on the neighbouring plains, Amidst thy brave companions, thy mail'd form Crested with glory, on thy pawing steed Returning from the wars. And when at last Thou art in sickness laidâwho will forbid The dear sad pleasureâlike a holy bride I'll by thy death-bed stand, and look to heaven Where all bless'd union is. O! at the thought, Methinks this span of life to nothing shrinks, And we are bless'd already. Thou art silent: Dost thou despise my words? Erm. O no! speak to me thus: say what thou wilt: I am subdued. And yet these bursting tears! My heart is rent in twain: I fearâI fear I am rebellious still. [Kneeling, and taking both her hands between his, and kissing them with great devotion. School me or chide me now: do what thou wilt: I am resign'd and humble. Ter. (advancing to them with alarm). Hear ye that noise without?âThey force the door, And angry Ulrick comes. Erm. (starting from his knees furiously). Thank heaven this hated rival front to front Shall now oppose me! God avenge the right! Enter Ulrick, bursting into the room, followed by Bastiani. Ul. (to Erm.) Vow'd, holy knight; from all vain earthly love Pure and divided; in a lady's chamber Do we surprise thee? Quit it instantly: It is a place for thee unfit: and know, In sacred wardship will I keep that maid. Erm. In sacred wardship! O unblushing face! What of thy baseness, treachery, and falsehood I could declare, my choking voice forbids, Which utterance hath not.âHere's a ready tongueâ [Drawing his sword. Defend thee, then, and heaven defend the right! [They both draw, and fight furiously, Bastiani endeavouring in vain to interpose; when the legate and his train, with Garcio and the Knights of St. John, enter, and separate them. Leg. Put up your weapons: to the holy church This cause belongs, and to her high award I charge you both that you in all humility Submit. Lord Ulrick, to the pope perforce You must account of this your wardship give, Or by yourself in person, or your deputy, To Rome forthwith despatch'd. [Ul. bows sullenly. As for the lady, to my guardian care, Till we before the holy father come, She must commit herself. And thou, Sir Ermingard, Shalt to the sovereign pontiff and the patron Of thy most valiant order, fully show Wherein thou'st been aggriev'd. If the bless'd cross Thou hast assum'd, supposing other vows That did before engage thee, were annull'd, By false reports deceived; the holy Urban, Our wise enlighten'd father, will, I trust, A dispensation grant, that shall empower thee To doff with honour this thy sacred mantle, And in its stead a bridegroom's robe assume. [Ermingard and Aurora both embrace the legate's knees, who raises them up gently. It is enough; forbear, forbear, my children; I am too richly thank'd. And now we must with sober minds confer: For when the wind is fair, we sail for Rome. Some days, perhaps, it may adversely blowâ Perhaps some weeks; for I have known it oft Hold vessels bound. Aur. (tossing up her arms joyfully as she speaks). No; it will change to-morrow. Erm. Dear ardent soul! canst thou command the winds? [Aur. shrinks back ashamed. Leg. Blush not, sweet maid; nor check thy ardent thoughts; That gen'rous, buoyant spirit is a power Which in the virtuous mind doth all things conquer. It bears the hero on to arduous deeds: It lifts the saint to heaven. [Curtain drops. ROMIERO: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Don Romiero, a noble Spaniard. Don Guzman, his friend. Don Maurice, a youth in love with Beatrice. Don Sebastian, father of Zorada. Jerome, domestic of Romiero. Pietro, domestic of Romiero. Mariners, passengers, domestics, &amp;c.WOMEN Zorada, the wife of Romiero. Beatrice, her friend. Nurse. Scene in or near the castle of Romiero, by the seashore of the Mediterranean. Time, during the reign of Peter the Cruel, King of Castile, towards the middle of the 14th century. ACT I. SCENE I. The sea-shore after a storm, with the masts of a wrecked vessel seen above the water at a distance, and casks and various chests, boards, &amp;c. floating on the waves. Enter shipwrecked mariners and passengers, followed by Sebastian, who keeps apart from the others. 1st pass. Well, sirs! to tread on firm dry earth again Makes the heart glad and thankful. 1st mar. With good cause; For a dry grave at home is, after all, The secret wish and prayer of every seaman, Ay, even the boldest of us. None hath so long or roughly lived at sea As to be careless where his bones are laid,â In sacred ground, or in the gulfy deep. And thou, too, thinkst so, if I read thee right. [To 2d passenger. 2d pass. Ay, so in truth thou dost; I said my prayers Devoutly as the tempest louder wax'd, Nor am ashamed to own it. 2d mar. Nor needs to be so; seaman as I am, Let me, as oft as fortune beckons me, On summer seas or rough December's waves, Career it boldly with my jolly mates; But let me die at last in mine own cot, With all my kinsfolk round me. My poor wife! She listens to the winds when others sleep, And thinks,âWell, well! we are all safe on shore. 3d mar. But, saving this, what have we else to cheer us? Men on dry land are hungry and lack food; We cannot live on safety only. See, Here comes a countryman. Ho! friend, I say! [Calling off the stage. (Voice answering without.) What dost thou say? I cannot hear thy words. 3d mar. Come hither, if thou hast a Christian heart, Or any charity; come near, I pray thee. Enter Pietro. Pie. What is your will with me? 3d mar. I pray thee, friend, What shore is this? Be there or food, or shelter, Or Christian pity in these parts? Thou seest What miserable shipwreck'd men we are. Pie. Yes, ye are cast upon a shore, where shelter And Christian pity never are withheld From those who want them. Seest thou through the trees That castle? There a noble lady dwells, Who will have pity on you. 3d mar. Thank Providence for this! Your noble ladies, When once they take to goodness, are most bountiful: The best of all; the men to them are nothing. 1st pass. She hath no lord then? Pie. He is absent now, Kept at the king's high court, as it is said, But my opinion isâ 3d mar. Whate'er it be, That is not our concern. What is his name? Pie. They call him Don Romiero. Seb. (advancing hastily). What saidst thou? Is he absent? Pie. He is, but his good lady will relieve you, Ye need not fear for that. Seb. We will not fear. Ye love that lady, then, Who is, ye say, so good? Pie. How should we else? A very brute would love her. Seb. Yes, thou sayst well; she was e'en from her birthâ I mean, all ladies sprung from noble blood Are, from their birth, to generous actions train'd; At least, it should be so. Pie. And is so, friend; for I have oft observ'd Good birth and breeding, as in my own lady, With gracious kindness join'd. Seb. What is her name? Pie. Donna Zorada. Thou hast heard, belike, How her poor fatherâ Seb. (turning away). No; I hear no stories; I am a man withdrawn from worldly coil, Who hears or cares for nothing. Pie. (to 3d mar.) This is no mariner? and he speaks strangely. 3d mar. The strangest thing is that he spoke at all. We took him up at sea from a small boat, Which, by the moonlight, we descried afar, Like a black cockle on the glimmering waves; But whether earth or hell had sent him to us, We doubted much. 1st mar. Nay; when the hurricane wax'd to its pitch We scarcely doubted, and were once resolved To cast him overboard. Yet, ne'ertheless, He hath escaped; and God be praised, we did not. Pie. Hush! he returns again. Go on, poor souls, In lucky hour ye come; for in that wood Not many paces hence, amongst the trees, Donna Zorada takes her morning walk; You'll find her there. Come, I will lead you to her: And, as we go, there are some words of counsel Which I shall give to you. They may be useful; For age, and some small share of shrewd observance, Have made me, though I say it, fit to counsel. 1st mar. Do so, good man, and heaven reward thy kindness! [Exeunt all but Sebastian. Seb. (alone). So near her! Led, as by the hand of heaven, Even to her very door! And I shall shortly See her again, and hold her to my heart! My child! my child! Oh! when those gentle eyes Look on my woe-worn face and alter'd form, And these coarse weeds, how will thy piteous heart Swell e'en to bursting! In that wood hard by,â So near me! Blessed heaven hath brought me here. [Exit. SCENE II. A wood, with various walks and alleys cut through it. Enter Zorada and Beatrice, speaking as they enter. Bea. In truth, I slept it out. At times, indeed, A sound came to my ears, as it had been The distant roar of wheels, and then I dreamt Of coursing chariots and approaching crowds, And courtly tournaments, and tried in vain To cast my richest mantle o'er my form, To meet the coming show! Zor. Thy mantle for the show! Bea. Yes, but perversely, Still, as one tassell'd end across my shoulders I had composed, the others to the ground Fell dangling all awry. Then I look'd down, And, O sight of confusion! Canst thou guess What saw I then? Zor. Some fearful thing, no doubt. Bea. My own bare feet unslipper'd and unhosed, That on the chequer'd floor began to move In dancing measure. Yea, the very blood Rush'd to my cheeks; I felt it in my dream. Zor. How could a dream so vain find harbourage In thy fantastic brain, my little friend, On such a dreadful night? Bea. It was the tempest's sound that brought the dream. Zor. So grand a cause producing thoughts so vain! Bea. Who takes account of that? Thou wert awake, Else thou, belike, hadst ta'en the mighty blast For the quick waving of some gallant's hat To cool thy glowing cheek, or the soft winnowing Of outstretch'd pinionsâCupid's wings, perhaps; Or those of downy swans, as I have seen them, Scared from the sedgy margin of the lake, Bending their hurried flight across thy path. Zor. I was, indeed, awake, and heard with awe The war of elements, whose mingled roar Brought to mine ear the howl of raging fiends, The lash of mountain billows, the wild shrieks Of sinking wretches; and at intervals Cross'd strangely with the near distinctive sounds Of clatt'ring casements, creaking beams and doors Burst from their fastenings, swinging in the blast. It was a fearful night; and many a soul, On sea and land, have found a dismal end. Bea. Ay, we shall hear sad tales of this ere long, When seated round our evening fire. Alas! It will be piteous; but, the ill then past, It will be soft and pleasing piteousness. Zor. Sad tales, I fear! O how my sympathy Follows the seaman's hardy, perilous life; And the poor passengers, torn from their homes To toss upon the rude and fathomless deep, Who shall no more on the dry land set foot, Nor find a peaceful rest e'en for their bones. It is a dismal thought. Bea. And yet how fair and bright the morning shines, As if it laugh'd at all the late turmoil! There's not a cloud in the whole azure sky. Zor. None, save those little wanderers, pure as snow, Those wild bewilder'd things, so hasting on Like sea-birds to their rock.âWhat men are these? Enter Mariners, &amp;c. 1st mar. We are, an' please ye, good and noble lady, Poor shipwreck'd seamen, cast upon your shore; Our all is lost; and we are spent and faint For want of food. Zor. Ye shall not want it long. Go to the castle, where all needful succour Will be provided for you.âFrom what port? But stop not now to answer idle questions. Are ye all mariners? 1st mar. (pointing to pass.) Those men are merchants; And he who lingers yonder 'midst the bushes, Is one we found at sea, some leagues from shore. We know not what he is. Zor. Why keeps he thus aloof? Call to him, friend. 1st mar. (calling off the stage.) Ho! there; come this way, sir; the lady calls ye. Zor. He has a noble air, though coarsely clad. How is it that he moves so tardily? 3d mar. He's wayward, lady; neither mores nor speaks Like other men. Zor. Nay, do not speak so harshly Of one so circumstanced; your fellow-sufferer. Enter Sebastian, bending his head, and keeping his eyes fixed on the ground. Good stranger, be assured you're welcome here, And be not so desponding. [He bows in silence, and she seems agitaled. (To the mariners, &amp;c.) Pass on, my friends; this lady will conduct you. Wilt thou, my Beatrice, do this kind office? And I will follow shortly. Tell my people To serve these shipwreek'd strangers bountifully. Mariners, &amp;c. (speaking all together). God bless your liberal heart, my noble lady! [Exeunt all but Zor. and Seb. Zor. (eagerly). Who art thou? Seb. Hush, till they be farther off. Zor. Oh! is it thou? Seb. Stand from me; no embrace; They may look back and see us. Zor. How slow they move! Will they ne'er gain the thicket? My yearning heart will burst; how slow they move! (Stands looking after them impatiently and trembling all over for a few minutes.) Now they are out of sight. (Rushing into his arms.) My father! my dear father! Seb. My dear child! Zor. Oh! art thou here in dread? come here to see me In peril of discovery? too, too kind! Dear father! kind, and good, and dear to me, How and where'er thou art. I fear, I fear Thou art not as I would: tears in thine eyes, And anguish on thy face! How hast thou fared? Seb. Thou shalt hear all when I have words to tell thee. Zor. Not now; take breath awhile, and be composed. Lean on the grass, and I will fetch thee nourishment. Seb. (preventing her from going). Not now, dear child I am composed again, and from my side Thou shalt not move, till I have told thee all. (After a pause.) Thou knowst the bitter wrongs and foul affront, Which my ungrateful monarch put upon me, As meet reward for many years of service. Ay, though I say it, valiant, faithful service In field and council. Zor. I know it all too well; a burning shame That he should so requite thee! Some base wretch Hath tempted him withâ Seb. Say his noble nature,â I think it once was noble,âwas abused By the base machinations of my foes. Say what thou wilt; I was a man, a soldier, And sought revenge, that baleful remedy For bitterness of heart. Zor. Nay, pause, I pray you! do not tell it now: Thou art too much distress'd. Seb. No, hear it now; 'tis short, and when once told, One misery is past. Leagued with three chiefs, Resentful as myself, we did in secret Derise the means, and soon had reach'd our mark. Zor. Your mark! O what was that? Seb. I see the fearful meaning of thine eye; But be not so disturb'd.âOur mark indeed Was vengeance, but not murder.âOn his throne We meant to place a nobler prince, whose hand Had even justice to his subjects dealt. We meant to place on Pedro's worthles brow That which became it better than a crown. Zor. I understand;âa monk's unseemly cowl. I'm glad you did not mean to shed his blood. Seb. My gentle child, we meant but as I say. And while revenging my especial wrongs, We should have freed Castile from a hard master, Who now sheds noble blood upon the scaffold, As lavishly as hinds the common water Of village pool cast o'er their arid fields. And yet to kindle in our native land The flames of civil discord, even this Has often rack'd my mind with many doubts, Recoiling thoughts, and feelings of remorse. Zor. Ha! that indeed had been a fearful consequence, Had your concerted enterprise succeeded. But speak not now of this. How did you fail? Seb. Amongst our number, one accursed traitor Like Judas lurk'd, and to the royal ear Divulged the whole.âBut we were warn'd of this, And fled, each as he might. I gain'd the coast, And lay disguised till I could find a boat, In which I reach'd last night that founder'd bark, Whose slender mast just peeps above the surge, Like some black wizard's wand, token of ill. Zor. No, not of ill, dear father, but of good. 'Tis heaven hath sent thee here. My lord did write to me some distant hints Of your sad story. When he shall return, He will protect you. Cherish'd here with us, You shall in secret live, till fair occasion Shall offer to convey you where you would,â Some land of safety. Seb. Thy lord's return! no, no! beware of that! He may not be my friend.âNay, it is said That he and others, from their kindred ties Suspected as abettors of our treason, To clear themselves, have sworn unto the king, Dead or alive, wherever they may find us, Our bodies to deliver to his power. Zor. 'Tis false! thou wrongst Romiero. Do not believe it. Some false Judas also Hath, in this point, deceived you. No, he did notâ He swore no oath so cruel and so base. Do not believe it.âHark! the castle bell! [Bell sounds. Seb. Some traveller of note must be arrived. Zor. And I must quit my dear and honour'd parent, With heartless ceremony to receive A most unwelcome guest.â Enter that tangled path; it leads to shelter, An aged woman's cot, where thou mayst rest And have refreshment. She will minister To thy necessity. O woe is me! That any hand but mine should have that office! Seb. When shall we meet again? Zor. At fall of eve beneath the castle wall, Near to the northern postern. Heaven watch o'er thee! There's some one coming! part as we were strangers, Without one sign of love. That is the path. [Exit Sebastian; and, after a pause, Don Maurice enters by the opposite side. Maur. Good tidings! Don Romiero is arrived. Zor. My lord return'd? and art thou sure 'tis he? Maur. Yes, I am sure; why should I doubt it, madam? His train is in the court, and joyful vassals, Hearing the notice bell, crowd in to greet him. I have not seen him yet, but am in haste Come to apprise you of it. [Observing Zorada motion with her hand, and point as to something at a distance. What man is that to whom you motion so? Zor. A shipwreck'd stranger, who inquired his way, But was about to take the erring path. Maur. He has a stately air, though mean his garb; I'll go myself and guide him through the wood. Zor. No, no! I pray thee, let us to the castle. Maur. I'll follow thee: but, 'faith, I fain would go And hold some parley with that stranger. Surely He is no common man. Zor. I do beseech thee! Maur. I'll soon return. [Going. Zor. O stay, Don Maurice, stay. Maur. Why? How is this? Zor. I cannot stir without thee. Maur. What is the matter, lady? You are pale. Zor. I've wrench'd my foot: I'm lame; I'm faint with pain. I pray thee let me lean upon thine arm. Maur. Ay, to the world's end. Nay, lean all thy weight, And let me bear thee up: thou dost but grasp me As if to hold me fast. The pain is violent. Zor. No, it is better now; 'tis almost gone, But I walk lamely still. Let us proceed. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. An open entrance hall in the castle. Jerome, vassals, and domestics, are discovered in waiting. Enter Pietro. Pie. (to Jer.) So, our good master is return'd in safety: May I not see him? Jer. No, not now, good Pietro. Pie. Not now! how so? It is my privilege, Which he has granted to this hoary head, To see him, unreproved, whene'er I list. I needs must greet him. Jer. Thou hadst better not! Donna Zorada is not in the castle To welcome his return: till he hath seen her, I think thy courtesy would have small chance Of courteous reception. Pie. Well, be it so: what changes wedlock makes, That Don Romiero should be so possess'd! He should have wedded earlier, as I think, Or not so young a bride. For, as they say, Let all things be in right and due proportion. Let not the hart play gambols with the fawn. Plant not a sapling olive by the side Of the broad oak. Link not the bony staghoundâ Jer. Truce with thy wisdom, now! see, he is coming. Enter Romiero, in a hurried, impatient manner, followed by Guzman. Rom. Not yet return'd! Go, Jerome, to the wood, That is her favourite walk. Jer. Please you, my lord, I have sent Blas already To search the wood, and now he is return'd. Enter Blas. Rom. Hast found her, Blas? Blas. Yes, she will soon be here; She's coming from the wood. Rom. With steps, I warrant, Light as the bounding roe. Blas. Nay, good my lord, Donna Zorada, somewhat lame, I guess, Comes with slow steps, supported on the arm Of young Don Maurice. Rom. I'll bear her in my arms: she is in pain. The very pressure of the velvet turf Will do her injury. [Exit hastily. Guz. (to Pie.) Thou wearst a surly smile upon thy face, Good Pietro, mine old friend; what may it mean? Thy lord, methinks, is a right tender husband. Pie. Ay, marry is he! I remember well His lady mother urged him oft to wed. âBecome a woman's toy!â quoth he: âam I Of such soft matter form'd, that you, forsooth Would make a husband of me?â Then he'd speak Of women, even the fairest and the best, With such sharp taunts, that she, good lady, sigh'd, And in despair forbore all further plea. Guz. But dost thou think he spake unfeignedly? Pie. Why should he feign with her who gave him birth? She was a woman of good parts, well taught Sober, and wise. Guz. And yet it might be so. Pie. I cannot tell; for now, as I remember, His love for Donna Laura none suspected, Till he was found at midnight in the vault Lamenting o'er her grave. 'Twas said that many a night a sheeted spectre Haunted the spot: that spectre was Romiero. Guz. It might be so: and yet he is not close, Concealing what he feels, but with his friends Free and confiding. Pie. Yes, St. Lawrence bless him. His thoughts must have their vent; but yet I say, And know it well, none did suspect his love Till he was found lamenting o'er her grave. Ah! many a cheerful face hides careful heart! This is a saying well approved by all. For sound experience teaches many things, Which, as my mother, heaven rest her soul, Was wont to sayâ Guz. Excuse me now, good Pietro; I'll stay and hear it all another time; I am in haste. [Exit. Pie. (looking after him with displeasure). He too in haste! That light and heedless youth, Full of their youthful sports, should be impatient When sober serious men begin to speak, Is nothing marvellous; it was always so. But now the evil still goes on increasing, And men of middle age and understanding Are e'en as light and foolish as the young. An evil sign, I trow, of evil times. Should it go on increasing, by my certes! Ere I have spoken half a sentence, off Each foolish varlet I address will run, And leave me most discourteously to find, As it may chance, another auditor For the remaining half.âO foolish times! Foolish and evil too! [Exit. SCENE II. Zorada's apartment. Enter Romiero and Zorada. Rom. Feelst thou no pain, my love? Thou art fatigued. Ah! why didst thou refuse thine own support? These arms that to the earth's far verge would bear, Blessing their toil, so sweet, so dear a burthen. Zor. Indeed, my lord, I needed no support; The pain had passed away: I walked with ease. Rom. The foolish envious pain which cast thee, sweet, Upon another's care. Thus, thus, and thus [Kissing her cheeks, and then both her hands, one after the other. I pay thee my devotion. Nay, look on me, Smile on me thy sweet smiles, and raise thine eyes, Sweet mate, sweet play-fellow, pretty Zorada! Zor. Nay, good my lord, these words are full of fondness, And yet they please me not. What shall I say? Speak to me as a wife, companion, friend, Not as a petted darling. Art thou well? How has it fared with thee since last we parted? My father tooâwhat dost thou know of him? Rom. Thou needst not fear for him; he has escaped; He is in safety in a foreign land, Where he, I hope, will end his days in peace. Zor. And shall I ne'er behold his face again? [He shakes his head. O but I will! I'll go to comfort him, And so wilt thou. Why dost thou turn from me? May it not be? Rom. Oh ask me not! I've swornâ Zor. What hast thou sworn? Rom. I cannot tell thee now. Zor. Then it is true! [Turning from him with violent gestures of distress and displeasure to the end of the chamber; then returning and looking in his face upbraidingly. How couldst thou; Oh! how couldst thou Swear to deliver to the tyrant's vengeance, Dead or alive, wherever thou shalt find him, My father, thine old friend, the brave Sebastian? Is it not so? If thou hast sworn an oath Less terrible than this, tell it me quickly. Rom. Dear love, he is in safety far from hence, This oath, as to his life, is nugatory; And, but for it, thou ne'er hadst seen thy husband. Thou knowst the cruel nature of Don Pedro. Ah! why that face of sorrow and displeasure? Alas! I see I am not welcome here. Zor. No; say not so. Rom. How can I then explain Thy sad averted looks? Where art thou going? Zor. I'm faint; I am not well; I'm sick at heart; I long to be alone. Rom. Life of my life! Indeed, thou art not well; Then wherefore leave this chamber? [Pointing to a couch. Here lay thee down, and I will watch by thee. Zor. I'll rest me in my closet for a while! I'm wayward grown, and love to be alone. Rom. No; say not so; I know thou art not wayward; It is not in thy nature; but distress, From filial duty, strain'd, perhaps, too far, Hath made thee so. Remain, my love, with me; Thou wilt forgive me when thou hast consider'd. Zor. I cannot now consider, with a heart Gored to the quick. I pray you, then, my lord, Permit me to retire. Rom. I'll lead thee to thy closet: lean on me. [She waves him off with her hand. Wilt thou not deign to do it? [Exit Zorada, still motioning him not to follow her; (stopping, with clasped hands, in a thoughtful posture, after having paced several times rapidly across the room.) An absent father and a present husband I' th' scales are put, and, to all outward seeming, The last doth kick the beam. Is it for thisâ For this that I have given my freedom up, Drawn every strong affection of my heart To one dear point?âand this the poor return! [After a second pause. My life in such a perilous circumstance, And now restored to her and to my home! This is of small account. O woman, woman! One corner of a gallant's passing fancy Pleaseth thee well; the whole devoted heart Of man matured is to thee as a yoke, A cumb'rous weight from which thou wouldst escape; And friendship, filial duty, every tie Defrauds thy husband of his dear-earned rights. [After pacing again through the room as before. I am a fool! I knew the heart of womanâ Knew what she had to give, and, Oh! too well, What might, at price of many an inward pang, To her be given; yet, ne'ertheless, forsooth! I murmur at my lot. [These last words spoken while Don Guzman is entering behind him. Guz. What art thou mutt'ring? Murmurs at thy lot! Were these the words I heard thee utter now In such a smother'd voice? With fair Zorada Within that lot comprised, wouldst thou exchange it For any other man's? Rom. No; not for his who fills th' imperial throne. Guz. What ails thee, then, possessing such a treasure? Rom. Ay, if I did possess it. Guz. Dost thou not? Rom. The heart I do not. Call ye it possessing, When any tie of friendship or of nature Crosses the vows which she has given to love? Guz. I do not understand fantastic notions And fine-spun niceties of sentiment. I'll comprehend thee better presently. Rom. 'Tis plain and simple matter. My return, Though from a perilous state, gives to Zorada Slight pleasure: her affections and concern Are all engross'd by what is duty call'd To her unhappy father. I am nothing. Guz. And is this all, indeed, that troubles thee? Rom. Should there be more? Why dost thou smile so strangely? Guz. At thy most simple folly, noble friend. Surely the men in these degenerate days, When every high-plumed youth and idle stripling Hath leave to play his gambols in the sight Of maids and married dames without reproof, And pour bewitching nonsense in their ears At feast or tourney, is most fortunate, Who can but charge a young and lovely wife With too much duteous love for her old father. [Laughing heartily. I needs must laugh: thou art fantastical. Rom. No; thou art light of heart and canst not judge: Having no care thyself, thou art incredulous Of any cause which others have for care. To speak to thee of what I feel, is folly, Though, from long habitude, I needs must do it. Thou hast no sympathy, and yet my heart Clings to thee as a friend. Guz. Nay; fie upon thee! Thou knowst full well that unto the world's end I'd run to serve thee, though my pliant lip Cannot approve of all thy fleeting notions. But we'll debate no more on things so irksome. I came to say that Maurice hath invited me To see some curious cave which yesterday He first discover'd, as along the shore In quest of sea-birds' eggs he idly wander'd. Rom. Has he been here so long? Guz. Doubtless he has. It is a curious sight This fairy cave, as he described it to me: I shall be absent for an hour or so; Perhaps, a little longer. [Exit. Rom. (alone). He is fortunate, Who can but charge a young and lively wife With too much duteous love for her old father! The smile that follow'd too,âthat had its meaning. Lame and not lame, and leaning on his arm! The stroke darts through me like an adder's sting, Though but so slightly given. Re-enter Guzman with Maurice. Guz. Maurice is come with me to tempt thee out, If we may be so bold. The fairy cave Is a short ride from hence, the day is cool, And we will wait thy pleasure. Maur. I pray you be entreated, good my lord. Rom. I thank ye both; I mean to stay at home. Maur. What! here alone, the ladies being retired? On such a day as this, when the blue waves Heaving and sinking in the sunny gleam. Show all the changes of their crisped sides Like the seam'd foldings of a silken robe; When every sea-bird is upon the wing Skimming and diving for his finny prey; When distant vessels, tacking to the breeze. Seem dames whose snowy kirtles are stretch'd out To the slow measure of some courtly dance;â On such a day as this to stay at home In gloomy chambers pentâ Rom. Surprises thee. Maur. In truth it does. Methinks on such a day, Did not we see above the glassy brine The mast of that wreck'd vessel still appear To tell the dismal tale of last night's storm, One would with buoyant heart say to the ocean, Let us career it o'er thy surgy fields To every coast o' th' earth. Rom. I doubt not, sir, 'tis a fair sight to those Who come so far afield to look upon it. Is thine old tutor dead, or dame Magera, That thou art rambling gallantly at large In this our distant province?âDost thou blush? That is a folly, if thou hast no cause. Maur. I fear, my lord, I have offended you. I am as free to ramble now at large As any he who reckons twice my years; Nor should my visit to this distant province Be deem'd an idle ramble; Don Fernandez, My aged kinsman, claims some duty of me: I am an inmate of his lonely tower. Guz. Pooh! boy, thou'st said enough, and somewhat more: Who cares about thy visit to thy kinsman? Rom. Who does not care? It is an age of duty; Nought now is cherish'd in the tender breast But ties of blood; and his good company, With all his lore and saws and thrice-told tales, Will well reward the virtue of this youth. Go to your cave, and see it in its beauty: The billows else may wash its shelly sides, And make it bare and little worth to-morrow. (Aside to Guzman.) Take him away: why do ye linger here? Guz. (aside to him). Why speakst thou so unkindly to the youth? Rom. (aside). Spoke I unkindly? Then 'twas unawares, I meant it not. Guz. (aside). Be civil to him then, and make amends; He stares and wonders at such taunting words. Rom. (aloud). A pleasant ride, my friends. [They turn to go, and he calls after them. And hark, Don Maurice! If thou preferr'st a wayward captious host (For such I do confess myself to be), With two fair ladies (both methinks are fair), To thine old kinsman's company, return, And be one night at least our honour'd guest. Maur. I do, with thanks, accept your courtesy. [Exeunt Maurice and Guzman. Rom. (looking after Maurice). The very eye and visage, light and thoughtless; A woman's varying blushes with the tint Of sun-burnt hunter mix'd; the very form, Slight as a stripling, statured as a man, Which hasâdetested spell! so oft beguiled The female fancy, prizing worthless show. (After a pause.) Can it be so? O no! it cannot be; I but distract myself. I'll crush within me All thoughts which this way tend, as pois'nous asps That sting the soul and turn its bliss to bane. (After another pause.) To think of it no more, indeed, were good, If it were possible. And yet to know The truth, if fair or foul, were better still; They are both placed beneath my observation; 'Tis well I did invite him for the night. [Rings a bell violently. Enter Jerome. [A pause, Romiero seeming unwilling to speak. Jer. What do you want, my lord? Rom. Thyself, good Jerome. Who follow'd thee? I heard a creaking step. Jer. It was mine own, my lord. Rom. 'Tis well; come nearer, man. How many oaks Have by my brawny foresters been fell'd, Since I left home? Jer. I do not know, my lord. Shall I inquire? Rom. Of what wouldst thou inquire? Jer. The oaks which you have just been speaking of. Do you not wish to knowâ Rom. True; but I have another thing to say. How many times hath this young don been here To visit Donna Beatrice? Jer. To visit her? Rom. Yes, fool! to visit her. Why dost thou look so strangely at the question? Answer it in few words and faithfully. Jer. He hath, for some days past, come to the gate, At noon-tide hour or so, but whom to visit It suits not me to say. Rom. Then! 'tis not Beatrice he comes to visit? Jer. It does not so appear; it may,âit may not. Rom. Why dost thou hesitate and stammer thus? Art thou afraid to speak? What is the matter? Jer. Nothing, my lord, but you did fix your eyes With such a keen intenseness on my face, I fear'd I might offend. Rom. How fear'd, unless the thing thou hast to say Should be of bad import? Jer. As I breathe life, Nothing of good or bad import have I To tell your honour. Rom. Well, well! be it so. Thy strange bewilder'd face made me suspect thee. Why dost thou wait? Jer. Your further pleasure, sir. Rom. There's nothing else.âYes, yes! go bid my huntsman Prepare him for to-morrow's early chace. Jer. Why, good my lord! he died the very day Before you left the castle. Rom. Ay, true, I had forgotten.âGet thee gone. [Exit Jerome. (Alone.) I like not his scar'd face and wary words: Something is always wrong when such as he Stammer, and stare, and weigh their phrases so. [Exit. SCENE III. Night. A grove near the walls of the castle, which is seen in the background, the moon appearing behind it. Enter Maurice. Maur. (after listening). No footstep near, no stirring of the boughs, Which cast their darken'd forms, distinct and motionless, Athwart the paly lustre of the moon! No gentle messenger to meet my hopes!â Ah Hope! who makest the lover still thy fool! Do I not know that she would give her presence To no man living at an hour like this, In such a spot as this, yet twice already Some birch's shiny stem or blossom'd shrub Have been to me her very form and semblance. She may despise my billetâtear itâburn it, Yet my heart beats as thoughâHa! here comes Jerome. Enter Jerome. What news? Jer. Good news. Maur. I'd smother thee with kisses, But that thou art such an unseemly hound. How look'd she? Was she angry? Was she pleas'd? Will she vouchsafe to hear me plead my suit? Jer. She will. Maur. And where? Jer. In the long gallery, Now unfrequented. I will be on watch That no intruder break upon your meeting. Maur. Prince of Castile, go doff thy hat and plume; I am a prouder, happier man than thou! Jer. Hush, hush! begone,âI hear a noise without. Maur. Where? Jer. To the right. We'll take the other path; Though I must needs return by this again. [Exeunt. Enter Zorada and Nurse by the opposite side. Zor. Stand thou aside, good nurse; I'll on some paces, And softly call; if he be near at hand, He'll know my voice. [Coming forward to a thicket near the front of the stage. Ho! art thou there? come forth;âcome forth and fear not. Perhaps he has mistaken thy direction, I think he is in covert farther on. I hear a rustling, yonder, to the left. [Returns again to the bottom of the stage, and enter Sebastian. They embrace each other, while nurse stands apart. Seb. My child! my dear Zorada! Zor. Dear, dear father! Seb. And thou must meet me as a man proscribed: Child of a parent, reft of name and honours, Bann'd by the church, and by the laws condemn'd E'en to the traitor's death of degradation: One whom to name were pain and insult to thee; One now despised of all, forgot, accurst. Zor. O not accurst! for I will bless thee, father, Though every other tongue should blast thy fame. O not forgotten! I'll remember thee; Ay; nightly, daily, hourly, in my thoughts Shalt thou have place; more cherish'dâmore endear'd, For that all hearts beside have shut thee out. O not despised! for I will honour thee, And in my pious thoughts, as now in act, Kneel at thine honour'd feet in faithful duty. Seb. Rise, dearest, kindest, best, mine own Zorada! Yes, child; thou shalt be all the world to me; But it must be a faint, ideal world. I may in dreams, in thought, in musing fancy Behold thy face, thy form,âmay hear thy voiceâ But many a league of ocean and of land Must lie between us. E'en my dying day Will not be lighten'd with one look of thine. Zor. (after weeping on his neck). We do not know what heaven appoints for us. Seb. Has Don Romiero spoken aught to thee Respecting my sad fate? Zor. He has: 'tis trueâthe dreadful tale is true. The king has bound him by the horrid oath Which thou didst mention to me.âBase compliance! Seb. Nay, blame him not; he took it in the faith That I was safe, beyond the reach of power. But this being so, I needs must rest in hiding, Secure and close, till thou canst find a vessel To take me from the coast. Zor. There is within the precincts of this wood An old abandon'd chapel, where the dead Rest undisturbed. No living tenant there, But owlet hooting on the ruin'd tower, Or twitt'ring swallow in his eaves-screen'd nest, Will share the dismal shelter: for a time Thou mayst be there secure. My good old nurse Has all things duly stored for food and rest, And will conduct thee to it. Come, dear nurse! Greet thine old master in his time of sorrow, And take of him good care. Nurse. Yea, that I will; for unto me and mine He hath been ever kind and bountiful. O woe the day! that I should have occasion To do him such a service! Seb. Ay, nurse; there be sad changes in men's fortunes. The day when first I saw thee to thy breast Lay this dear child, a little toothless infant, Whilst o'er ye both bent with fond beaming eyes The best and fairest lady of the land, For so she was,âthat was indeed a dayâ A day of brightness. Ah! how different From this most dismal hour! Nurse. She was a noble lady, fair and gentle! This wicked world did not deserve to hold her, And so her time was short. And for her babeâ My babe;âI call'd her mine, and still will call her,â A very cherub, peeping from the clouds, As our fair pictures show them, is less beautiful Than she half-covered with her cradle-clothes, When waking from her morning's sleep, appear'd. Ah me! the pleasant days that I remember! Zor. (alarmed). I hear a noise. Seb. Thou art, my dearest child, alarm'd for nothing. Zor. Yes; I fear every thing. But, right or wrong, Go instantly, nor linger longer here. Nay, go: we do not part: I'll see thee soon. Seb. Heaven bless thee, then! Come, nurse, I'm now thy child, Cherish me kindly. Nurse. Ay, bless your honour! I will do my best. I'd give the life-blood in this poor old heart For you and yours. [Exeunt Sebastian and nurse. Zorada goes by the opposite side, meeting Jerome, who enters at the same time, and hurries along, covering her face as she passes him. Jer. Who's that who starts aside with guilty haste? [Following her. Ho! damsel, mistress, whosoe'er thou be, Let me have words of thee. I swear, good faith! I'll take thee safely to thy rendezvous, If thou wilt trust me. [Following her off the stage, and then returning. What have I done? What have I seen? No face, For that was closely cover'd, but the figure, The robe, the air,âif it be not Zorada, I am a foolâa purblind, mazy fool, And do not know my right hand from my left. What brings her here? Were't any other woman, It were an easy thing to guess her purpose. Well, who lives long may see strange things, they say; And if I needs must give my thoughts the rein, I'll curb my tongue. [Exit. ACT III. SCENE I. An outer room in the apartments of Zorada, with a wide door opening in the bottom of the stage, which shows a magnificent bedchamber, where Romiero is discovered walking to and fro in a distracted manner; he then rushes hastily from it to the front of the stage, and bends his ear to listen. Rom. No footstep yet: all's still: 'tis past endurance. So late! the first night, too, of my return! Is it the tardiness of cold aversion? 'Tis more than that; some damned conference Elsewhere detains her. Ay, that airy fool Wore at the supper-board a conscious look, Glancing in concert with the half-check'd smile That moved his quiv'ring cheek, too well betraying His inward triumph: 'twas a cursed smile; I would have cast my javelin at his throat, But shame withheld me.âShe the while did sit With pensive fearful eye, that always fell, Beneath my keen inquiring look, reproved. Is virtue thus demure, restrain'd, mysterious? She, too, who was as cheerful as the light, Courting the notice of my looks! no, no! Some blasting change is here. What can be done? For something must be done. [A pause and listening. Ho there without! Who walks at this late hour?âA heavy step; Have they their emissaries on the watch To give them notice of my movements? Ho! Ho there without! Enter Servant. What dost thou up? Why art thou not abed? Serv. My lord, it is not yet our hour of rest. Rom. Thou liest! 'Tis late; 'tis past the midnight watch. Serv. I do believe scarce half an hour has past Since I did light your honour from the hall. Rom. Peace! thou art fool or knave, I know not which. I've pass'd since then two hours as truly told As sun on dial moves.âWhy shrinkst thou back? Serv. I hear my lady coming. Rom. Coming at last! Haste! leave me; go thy ways. [Exit servant. [Putting out a lamp which stands on a side table. Out light! The partial gleam from yonder door, Will, as she enters, fall upon her strongly; I'll stand aside, and mark her face unseen. Enter Zorada, who stops short to wipe tears from her eyes, &amp;c., as if preparing herself to appear composed; whilst Romiero, in the shade, after eyeing her suspiciously, bursts suddenly upon her. Have done with all this smoothing of thy features, And look as sad and rueful as thou wilt. The tardy, slow unwillingness, and all Thy strange demeanour of this day, too well Speak that which e'en the smiles of Hebe's cheek, Hadst thou more female art such smiles to copy, Could not gainsay.âWhere hast thou been so long? Wilt thou not answer me? Zor. You frighten me, Romiero, as I reckon 'Tis little past our usual hour of rest. Rom. Thou dost evade the question. Not the time;â Where hast thou been? Zor. Have patienceâO have patience! Where I have been I have done thee no wrong: Let that suffice thee. Rom. Ha! thou'rt quick, methinks, To apprehend suspicion. Done no wrong! What call'st thou wrong? Yea, by that sacred band Which linketh soul to soul in wedded love, Pure, fervent, and confiding,âevery thought, Fancy, and consciousness, that from thy husband, Unfitting for his ear, must be withheld, Is wrong to him, and is disgrace to thee. Zor. Then woe is me! Since wives must be so perfect, Why didst thou wed Zorada de Modinez? Rom. Dost thou upbraid me for it? Then too well I see the change.âYes, I will call it change, For I must still believe thou lovedst me once. Zor. Yes, yes! I loved thee once, I love thee now, And will for ever love thee, dear Romiero, If thou wilt suffer me. Rom. Suffer thee, dear Zorada! it is paradise To think thou lovest me, hell to doubt of it. Zor. Then doubt it not. If I am cold and sad, I have a cause,âI must repeat my words,â Which does to thee no wrong. Some few days hence Thou shalt know all, and thou wilt pity me. Did I e'er tell thee that which afterwards Thou foundst to be untrue? Rom. Thou never didst. Zor. Then why suspect me now? Rom. Give me thy dear, dear hand, my own sweet wife! Yes, I will trust thee, and do thou the while Think charitably of my stern rebuke. Love can be stern as well as tender, yet Be all the while most true and fervent love. But go to rest, dear child, and I will follow thee; For it indeed is late. [Stands musing as she retires, then turning suddenly. Zorada! Zor. (returning). What, my lord? Rom. Forget not, lore, That soothing ointment of such efficacy. Zor. For what, I pray? Rom. Didst thou not wrench thy foot? Zor. O, not at all. Rom. Didst thou not say thou hadst? Zor. O that was but a feint to cheat Don Maurice. Rom. To cheat him! wherefore cheat him? for what end? Was it a time for childish freaks like that? And the deep colour crimsoning thy cheekâ What does it say?âGo to! thou needst not speak. Zor. Indeed, indeed you err; my heedless wordsâ Rom. Were very, very heedless.âGo to bed; Go, go! my hour of rest is distant still. Linger not here, I say; retire to rest. [Exit Zorada into the chamber. (After musing some time.) I do not think her wicked, but there lurks Within her fancy vain and dangerous things. Those striplings,âthose light, beardless playfellows The devil himself hath not an imp more subtle Than one of these.âThey laugh, and mock, and mimic, And cast upon the lovely face of virtue, The gloomy veil of cloister'd melancholy, While vice is all so gay and deftly trick'd, That who can choose but range them on her side? To break down every sacred tie, what is it? 'Tis but a merry trick!â Ay, she was wary, too, in her expressions: âDid I e'er tell thee that which afterwards Thou foundst to be untrue.ââEquivocation, A half-corrupted woman's poor device. [Muses and mutters to himself a few moments longer, and then paces up and down with slow irresolute steps. âA half corrupted woman! If it be come to this, who shall restrain The hateful progress, which as rapidlyâ Restrain it! No! to hell's profoundest pit Let it conduct her, if she hath so far Debased her once pure mind, and injured me. I dare not think on't, yet I am compell'd; And at the very thought a raging fire Burns in my head, my heart, through every vein Of this distracted frame. I'll to the ramparts, And meet the chillness of the midnight wind; I cannot rest beneath this hateful roof. [Exit. SCENE II. An old Gothic gallery, with doors leading to different apartments. Enter Jerome, carrying a light, and followed by Don Maurice. Maur. I am the first at our appointed place, Which is beseeming in affairs of love. I hope, meantime, she is upon the way. List, dost thou hear a step? Jer. My ears are not so quick. Maur. Am I again deceived? and hearst thou nothing? Jer. I hear the swallows stirring in their nests, Disturb'd with sudden light. Such creatures build In ev'ry crevice of those mouldering arches. Maur. Didst thou not tell me these adjoining chambers Are all untenanted, and no one near us. Jer. (pointing). Yes, all are empty but that further room, In which Don Guzman chooses to abide, That from its lofty windows he may see A more extensive prospect. Maur. Would he were at the utmost verge of all That may be thence survey'd!âI like it not: He is a dangerous neighbour. Jer. But he is tired and gone, ere this, to rest: You need not fear to be disturb'd by him. Maur. I hear a footstep now she comes, she comes! O she is good and punctual to my wish! Do thou retire, good Jerome. Enter Beatrice attended, and Jerome with her female attendant keep on the background, while Maurice, running eagerly to her, leads her nearer the front. My charming Beatrice! may I indeed Believe that thou art here; that thou vouchsafest To come with thoughts of favour for thy slave? Bea. Perhaps I do but dream I am so bold. It is so strange,âmy mind is so bewilder'd! Maur. And why bewilder'd, love? There's nought to fear. Bea. I've heard sounds of alarm, and seen faint forms, That seem'd to follow me, and yet were nothing. I thought the very stones of the old walls Did call my name and know me as I pass'd. Maur. Fear nothing, love: this place is unfrequented: Swallows or bats may whisper of our meeting, But nought besides.âOh! how I have desired To tell thee all my heart; on bended knee To plead my cause!âMy fate is in thy hands; And since thou hast such pity of my pain As thus to listen to me, may I hope Thou wilt be better still? Bea. Go not so fast: perhaps I am but come To chide thee for thy most presumptuous message. Maur. And if thou do, I'll bear it all so meekly, That thou wilt say within thy cunning self, âThis man, in truth, is made to be a husband.â Bea. It were no cunning but a foolish self Could hold such inward parley. Every gallant Would laugh most certainly within himself, On hearing such a sober, grave conclusion Join'd to the noted name of gay Don Maurice. Maur. Nay, do not twit me now with all the freaks, And levities, and gambols charged upon me By every lean-faced dame that wears a hood. I will be grave, and dismal, and punctilious As heir at miser's funeral, if thou wilt, And all the while as blithe o' heart as he. I have as many fashions and demeanours, As mantles in a lady's wardrobe; choose,â I'll be whate'er thou wilt, if in return Thou wilt obey me but for some few hours. Bea. I hear a noise. Maur. Only the wind that moves yon creaking door. Step farther this way. [Leading her to the opposite side of the stage, near the door of Guzman's chamber. The time is precious, my most charming mistress! Let me speak plainly in few words. Thou knowst How much I fear Romiero's apt suspicion. Delay were dangerous: therefore by the dawn, In the dark grove of pines, meet me, prepared To quit with me the castle, and for life To share my lot. Deny me not: time presses: O let me urge thee!âAs for life I plead. Bea. (after a pause). What can I say?âI feel I should not say it, And yet I feel thou dost not plead in vain. Maur. Thou'lt meet me then,âdo not retract thy words. There is no time for slow deliberation. Thou'lt meet me by the dawn? Bea. Yes; I will meet thee in the grove of pines. Enter at the bottom of the stage a Servant, who whispers to Jerome, and then retires, upon which Jerome advances hastily to Maurice. Maur. What is the matter? Jer. Romiero is not yet in bed. A spy Who stood on watch without has given me notice. He wanders through the house like one possess'd, And may at last invade your privacy. Maur. He is not yet so near us. We shall hear him Ere he approach. Jer. His motions oft are sudden. Bea. Retire, retire! I'll meet thee by the dawn; So, till that time, adieu. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Don Guzman's chamber, who is discovered sleeping in his chair. Enter Romiero. Rom. Not yet abed! Ay, but he is asleep. Happy unwedded! Thou canst soundly sleep; Nor woman's fickleness, nor woman's guilt, Can bring disgrace or agony to thee. I'll not disturb him. [After remaining for awhile on the front of the stage musing and muttering to himself, he speaks, but in a low voice. The heart, the heart! What prize we but the heart! [Mutters again, then breaks out in loud and vehement utterance. No; though his lips had never touch'd her hand, If that be lost, I'm wretched! Guz. (waking). What sound is that? Who's there? Ha! thou, my friend! Rom. What has so startled thee? Guz. The voice that woke me. Thou must have heard it; 'twas a human voice. Rom. It was mine own, Don Guzman. Guz. What has befallen? Why wert thou so alarm'd? Or was it some sharp pang of bodily pain? Rom. No, no! it was not that; and I am here Only to share thy chamber for the night. Guz. And why? I am amazed. Rom. I've paced o'er ramparts, halls, and galleries, Till I have need of rest. Guz. And thou wouldst find it here? What strange caprice Debars thee from the fair Zorada's chamber; That place which gives the rest of paradise? Rom. Ah! so it did to me. It was a spot Where every lovelyâevery sweetest thing In seeming shelter, bloom'd i' th' early sun, Till the first sultry breath of southern winds Blasted its freshness, leaving nought behind But tainted fragranceâsere and faded flowers. It was the magic palace of a dream, Changed in an instant to some dismal den: It was a bower of healthful innocence, Changed to a lazar's vile and loathly ward: It wasâOh, oh! I know not what I say, Thinking of what I was and what I am. Guz. Nay; give thy ruffled thoughts a little pause; Be well assured things are not as thou fearst. She did appear so good. Rom. Alas! she did. If I but droop'd or look'd a little pale, The stroke of her soft hand, her kindly words, Her sweet breath on my cheek,âO! it did turn The hour of pain to bliss!âAnd all this happiness Was but delusionâbut a hov'ring vapour That covers for awhile the fenny pool. Guz. No, say not so! Is it not far more likely That the delusion rests with thee, my friend? Rom. (after musing, and without heeding what Guzman has said). Ay, if I did but droop, her look of sympathy Went to my soul. Or if I parted from her, Though only for a weekâa dayâ Guz. Cease, cease! Be well assured it is not as thou fearst. Try to compose thyself: what are thy proofs That she has been unfaithful? Rom. No; what a worldly judge would deem unfaithful I trust she has not been; but what avails it? He whom her fancy follows, he who pleases Her secret thoughts and wishes, is her lord, Let who will, by the power of legal right, Her body hold in thraldom.âNot unfaithful! If I have lost her heart, I've suffer'd all. No further outrage can enhance my wretchedness. [Turning quickly and taking hold of him. But thou believest that, e'en in this, my fears Are mere extravagance. [Pausing and looking earnestly in his face. Dost thou not think so? Dost thou not, Don Guzman? Guz. I hope they are. Rom. That hope implies a doubt; Ay, and a doubt which, when I saw thee last, Did not exist. Speak, speak! If thou mistrust her, It is on no slight grounds. Guz. Be more composed, and I will tell thee all. Rom. There's something then to tell; some damned thing. Guz. Nay, think not so; for, when I've told thee all, 'Twill make no certain proof against Zorada. And since thou thinkst her love for thee is changed, Caring but for her love, thou mayst the better Endure to learn the worst, if such should follow. Rom. (in a faint voice). I understand thee. Guz. Two hours since, perhapsâ I've been asleep, and cannot say how longâ But pause we now. Thy quiv'ring lips are white, Thine eyes are fix'd: lean upon me, my friend. Rom. A sickly faintness passes o'er my heart. Guz. (supporting him to the chair). Lean here awhile; thou canst not hear me yet. Rom. I'm better now. Guz. But we will pause awhile. Rom. Proceed, proceed! I'll listen, though thy words Were each the spik'd tooth of a martyr's wheel. Proceed:âSome two hours sinceâ Guz. Some two hours since, as, not disposed to sleep, I was perusing that old book of stories, I heard, and, as I judged, close to the door, Two persons speaking in the gallery. The voice of Maurice I could recognise, The other was a woman's. Rom. (starting from the chair). And Zorada's. Guz. Use not such frantic gestures of despair; I say not it was her's: perhaps it was not; Perhaps 'twas Donna Beatrice. Rom. No, no! It was Zorada. Absent from her chamber I found her at that time. When she return'd, At a late hour, we had some wrangling words, Gloz'd o'er, but poorly gloz'd, with female fraud, Which soon betray'd itself, and then I left her. Guz. 'Tis very strange; and what I heard them sayâ Rom. Ay, ay! proceed with that; and make no pause Till thou hast told the whole, though it should make me A very fiend of agony and shame. Guz. Thou grasp'st my throat so hard, I cannot speak. Rom. Well, well, then! Out with all their damned words, Till they have proved the blackest tint of guilt, And then will come the fatal end of all; The sabre clutch'd in strength; the stroke of vengeance; The horrible joy, that lasteth for a moment! Let all this be; let horror be unstinted! Let every misery light upon the head Of that most wantonâNo, the word would choke me; I will not utter it. Guz. Thou art beside thy wits; thou canst not hear me. The words they spoke, prove against her, and no one, An act of guilt, but only the intent. Rom. Intent! O monstrous! foul deliberation! If life-blood warm his heart another day, I am bereft, debased, and brutified, Unmeet to wear the outward form of manhood. Guz. Wilt thou not hear my story? Rom. I have heard it, Knowing the cursed purport; ne'ertheless, Relate it all, minutely as thou wilt, I'll listen to the end. Guz. I drew close to the door, and heard these words Distinctly spoken in Don Maurice's voice:â âThou knowst I fear Romiero's apt suspicion; âDelay were dangerous; therefore, by the dawn, âMeet me beneath the grove of pines, prepared âTo quit the castle. We will fly together:ââ Or words to this effect, which indistinctly Fell into softer whispers, till, alarm'd, As I suppose, they left the gallery. 'Twas my intent to give thee early notice; Therefore I shunn'd that tempting couch, and sought Here, in my chair, to snatch a little sleep, And be in readiness ere break of day. Rom. Thou hast done well. [After a pause. Come to this pitch of secret profligacy, Who was so modest and so timid once! Was I a tyrant, that she is so ready, To doff the virtuous and respected wifeâ For the base mistress of that minion too? Some spell, some devilish witchery, hath subdued her, Ere it could come to this. Guz. Ay, so I think, if that in verity It be Zorada. Rom. O 'tis she! 'tis she! Thinkst thou I am a fool to be deceived By such affected doubts, in pity utter'd? Speak truly, plainly, treat me as a man. Call themâyea call that woman, an' thou wilt,â Guz. Fy, fy! Zorada is not yet aâ Rom. (putting his hand on the lips of Guzman). Hold! Speak not the word; I'm weaker than I thought: Is it not near the dawn? Guz. I think 'tis distant still. Rom. Surely it is not. We'll to the eastern turret, and look forth: Should they escape!âMy brain burns at the thought. Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. A grove of pines, and the sky of morning, before sunrise, seen through them. Enter Romiero and Guzman, from a thicket at the bottom of the stage. Rom. The dull light through yon bank of misty clouds Hath changed its tanny hue for silver grey; 'Tis near, 'tis actually, 'tis past the time. Guz. Have patience; for the sun, I guess, is still Behind the eastern hills. Rom. Should they escape!âSome cursed emissary, Upon the watch, perhaps, hath given alarm. Should they escape us by some other path!â It must not be: I will look out. Guz. (drawing him back to the thicket as he is about to advance). Keep still. I see them now; but let us be conceal'd Till they are nearer. Rom. They move tardily, With their damn'd dalliance.âSo very fond That they forget the peril of their state, Lost in the present bliss.â Ay; smile with lips which shall, within an hour, Be closed in death; and glance your looks of love From eyes which shall, ere long, in coldness glare Like glassy icicles. Guz. Stay; rush not on them now. Rom. See that! see that! her hand, and then her lips! Shall I look on, and give another moment To such abhorred transport.âWhere's my weapon? [Snatching his sword from Guzman, who attempts to remove it. Guz. Be not a madman in thine ecstasy, And foil thine own intent.âSee, they advance. Enter Maurice, leading Beatrice muffled in her mantle. Maur. Come, sweetest mistress mine, move we more quickly; Our horses wait us some few paces off; And by the baiting hour, when labouring hinds, Under some tree, sit round the loosen'd scrip, Holding on homely fare a merry feast, We will, like them, in all security, Enjoy a welcome rest. Rom. (rushing forth). Which shall to doomsday last, thou damned villain! [Draws fiercely upon him, while Beatrice runs away. They fight, but she presently returns and rushes between them, favoured by Guzman. Rom. Forbear, thou shameless woman.âBeatrice! Bea. It is, my lord; and O have pity on me! It is myself who am the most to blame. Pardon my dear, dear Maurice.âYes, you will. Your look of strange amazement, changed to joy, Emboldens meâOur hearts have long been join'd; O do not sever us! Rom. No, simple girl: Sever ye! by the holy rood I will not! I am right glad that ye are so united. Stick to it then; be thrifty of your love, To make it last; be doves in constancy. Good sooth, young fools! I will not sever ye. Bea. (kissing his hand). Thanks, noble, kind Romiero! Maur. Thanks for this frank and unexpected pardon! I fear'd, my lord, that you might deem it right To thwart my suit with Beatrice, who lived, Protected, as her friends might haply think, Beneath your roof. Rom. And thou thoughtst justly too. In cooler blood so ought I to have felt. Beshrew me! whither fled my wits the while? I have most freely given what is not mine. (To Guzman.) Do thou, my friend, untie this ravell'd knot. (Turning again to Maurice.) I'll plead thy cause, at least, and prove, perhaps, A powerful advocate.âSpeak to them, Guzman; And promise in my name, without reserve, All that my honour warrants. I, meantime, Must make my peace where I have need of pardon. [Exit in eager haste. Maur. How placable and kind beyond belief! Would I had fairly own'd to him my love, Since he is thus inclined! But he appear'd Hostile, and stern, and fretful at my stay, Unreasonably prolong'd. I had not courage To risk my happiness, which his caprice, Stern sense of honourâcall it as you pleaseâ Might in a moment blast. Guz. I blame thee not; hadst thou at first declared it, Thou wouldst have found him hostile. Maur. Then, pray, Don Guzman, what strange freak hath changed him? Guz. That he is changed, is your good luck; improve it, Without inquiring why you are so favour'd. Maur. And so we will, sweet Beatrice; we will Delay our happiness, to make it surer. Bea. Yes, Maurice; run no further risk; we'll both Return again and bide within the castle. Guz. No; be advised. (To Beatrice.) Do thou return alone; Some foolish freak may yet disturb his mind. I know he'll favour Maurice most when absent. (To Maurice.) Dost thou not comprehend me? Maur. Not very clearly: jealousy of one Whose love is fix'd on an acknowledged mistress, So fair, so lovely, were absurdâimpossible. Guz. Nay, only say absurd; for there be husbands, Ay, lovers too, who, should you cross their way, New-mated with the Queen of Love herself, And their own dame or mistress were in form Black as an Ethiop, would ne'ertheless Suspect you of designs against their peace. Then wonder not, Zorada being fair, If fanciful conceits disturb his brain. Maur. But I'll be circumspect. Guz. Go, foolish boy! Thy very shadow on the wall will show Some indication of sinister wishes. School thou the substance as thou wilt. Go, go! And be assured I'll prove thy friend when absent, Maur. (to Beatrice). And must we part? Bea. We shall not part for long. Maur No, not for long, sweet maid: beneath thy window I'll hold my midnight watch; and when thy casement Moves slowly on its hinges, I'll look up, And see thy beauty, by the moon's pale light, Sending sweet smiles to bless me.â When thou walkst forth, I'll in some thicket lurk, To see thee passâperhaps to touch thy robe. Wilt thou not give me, dear, before we part, Some token of thy love? Bea. Yes, gentle Maurice, thou shalt have a token, Which every hour thou'lt look upon, and think How dear, how trueâ Guz. I'll leave you for awhile To settle all this nonsense as you will; That done, we'll meet again in yonder alley, And I'll conduct the lady to the castle. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The apartment of Zorada.â She enters with nurse, who carries a basket in her hand. Zor. (speaking as she enters). And see, good nurse, that where the cold wind enter'd Thou stop the crevice well. Oh! that his head, His dear and honour'd head, should so be laid, While I am couch'd on down! Thou sayst his face Look'd not so sadly as before. Nurse. Indeed I thought so, madam: he spoke cheerily, And listen'd to my stories of past days, As if he liked to hear them. Zor. Alas! the very sound of human words, Address'd to him in peace, is now a solace Enjoy'd but rarely.âI must talk and smile, And keep my station at the social board, While my sad heart is thinking of his silent And lonely state.âThere is my picture then, Since he desires to have it. [Giving her a picture, which she puts into the basket. Nurse. Yes, madam, he did earnestly desire it. He bade me say to you, no lover ever Gazed on the features of a plighted mistress With such intense and yearning love, as he Will gaze upon this image. Zor. Yes; he will look, and think that in return It looks with love on him; but woe is me! He cannot know how dearly in my heart His image is impress'd. I call to mind His kind caresses in my infant years; His noble form in warlike harness braced, When he returning caught me to his heart, And heard my simple welcome with delight, Filling his eyes with tears. I well rememberâ Dost thou not also, nurse? the voice of fondness With which, e'en when I cross'd his graver mood, He call'd me little Zada. O 'twas sweet! I thought so then; but now it haunts mine ear Like portion of some broken melody, Which mocking bird is so enamour'd of, He will not learn the whole.âAnd say, good nurse, That I will surely see him ere he go, If it be possible. [Exit nurse. (After a thoughtful pause.) âMy little Zada! tush, my little fool! I will not have thee for my playfellow, If thou be so perverse.â No more than this; this was my worst rebuke. He set no heartless stepdame o'er my head, Though many ladies strove to win his love. He was both sire and mother to his child, Gentle as her I lost. Then for his sake I'll willingly endure The present misery. O, my Romiero! Wilt thou not trust my conduct for a day?â Absent all night! To what a state of passion His brooding fancy must have work'd his mind! Alas, alas; 'tis his infirmity. Enter Romiero. Rom. My dear Zorada! dear, dear wife! thy pardon: I crave it on my knees. O pardon one Who has offended from excess of love. I might have thought all eyes that look'd upon thee, With more than admiration look'd; but, Oh! To think that thy pure mind could e'er be moved To aught which blessed saints might not approve, Was monstrous, vileâyea a most vile suggestionâ Though all the while 'twas an offence of love. Thou art amazed, I see, and well thou mayst. I have but now discover'd what my fearsâ Zor. Fears! What hast thou discover'd? Rom. Be not alarm'd; nought that can injure thee. For if thou hast been privy to their love, Though I might chide thee as a cunning wife, Who from her husband hath a secret kept, The bane of confidence; yet being myself So deep in trespass, I must needs be meek, And say thou art not very, very naughty. Zor. Thy words are wild; I do not comprehend them. Rom. Dost thou not know thy fair but thoughtless friend Has to young Maurice's suit such favour given, That she this morning, short while since, was caught Escaping in his company? I watch'd and stopp'd them in the grove of pines. How glad a sight it was to me, when, wild, With terror wild, she rush'd between our weapons To find it was but Beatrice! Zor. But Beatrice? whom didst thou fear to find? Rom. Oh! spare me! Crimson shame upon my cheek, Betrays too plainly that for which already I've craved forgiveness. Zor. (drawing herself up proudly). Yes, I comprehend thee. Rom. Oh! but that look, that air, that flush of anger Which ne'er before so stain'd thy lovely face, Speak not of pardon. [She turns away, and he follows her. I have much offended. But he who like offence hath ne'er committed: Who ne'er hath look'd on man's admiring eye Fix'd on the treasure of his heart, till fear, Suspicion, hatred hath bereft his soul Of every generous feeling; he who never Hath, in that state of torture, watch'd her face Till e'en the traits of saintly innocence Have worn the shade of conscious guilt; who never Hath, in his agony, for her dear sake Cursed all the sex;âmay, as the world conceives, Be a most wise, affectionate, good husband; But, by all ecstacy of soul, by all That lifts it to an angel's pitch, or sinks it E'en to perdition, he has loved but slightlyâ Loved with a love, that is, compared to mine, As cottage hearth where smould'ring embers lie To the surcharged unquenchable volcano. Zor. What creed is this which thy perturbed mind Repeats so boldly? Good my lord, discard it, As a false faith. I have believed true love Of such a noble, high, confiding nature, That neither scandal's breath, nor seeming show Of fitful change, could shake its gen'rous trust. 'Twere agony for me to think thee false; But till thou front me with a rivalâyea, Till thine own words have own'd that thou art faithlessâ I will believe thee true. Rom. Believe, believe it! and on these dear hands, A thousand times caress'd, let me be vow'd Ne'er to offend again thy noble nature With e'en the slightest movement of suspicion! Dost thou relent, Zorada? Dost thou love me? Zor. Indeed I do; have I not often said it? And yet, it seems, thou didst mistrust my words. Rom. Fye on that gibe! let me have perfect pardon. Zor. (embracing him). Thou art forgiven. Now; art thou satisfied? Rom. I were a Tartar else, or sullen Turk. Sweet partner, lovely mate, my gentle wife! O the soft touch of this dear hand thrills through me, So dear! as dear as when thou first wert mine. [Stroking her hand, and then pressing it to his forehead and cheek. If word, or look, or circumstance, again E'er tempt me to conceive unworthy thoughts, I am a vulgar wretch, debased and mean, Unworthy even to look thee in the face, Or hold myself akin to virtue. No; I will no more offend. Re-enter Nurse, who is busy arranging her basket, and then looking up, starts on seeing Romiero. Nay, start not, worthy nurse; pray thee advance. Nurse. I cameâI thought my lady was alone. Rom. And so she is; for we are so united In every thought and wish, that thou shouldst reckon When with each other, we are still alone. Is it not so?âThou comest for some good purpose, I'll swear. To whom bearst thou that tempting fruit? Nurse. To no one, sir; I come to show its beauty; It is my lady's basket. Rom. Thou'st cull'd the best: my lips are parch'd and dry. May Iâ [Putting his hand to the basket. Nurse. Nay, good my lord, I'll choose you one. Rom. (rejecting what she offers). Not that: the further peach my fancy pleases. [Putting his hand into the basket. But there be dainty viands and cakes besides! Zor. A charitable dole for age and want. [Looking to the nurse significantly. That is the reason why I bade her show it, Ere she should take it to the poor distress'd. Rom. Ha! let me then restore my robbery; And here, to make amends. [Putting money into the basket. What have we here? [Taking out a picture. Is this a present for your villager? Nurse. Yes, please you.âNo, she but desired to see it. Rom. (with bitter irony). A most refined and sentimental gossip! Or does she mean to use it as a charm To cure old aching bones? Nurse. You've guess'd it well, my lord. Quoth she to me, Could I but see your lady's blessed face! Quoth I to her, thou canst not, by good reason: My lord is now return'd. Quoth she again, Could I but see her picture, lack a day! Rom. Have done: I see thy drift. Be not so eager To tell me how it is. I'm satisfied. Zor. Come to my closet, nurse; there is besides What I must charge thee with. [Exeunt Zorada and nurse, the last speaking loudly as she retires. Ay, ay, quoth she, poor soul! I have a longing To see that picture. Foolish man, quoth I, 'Tis but a paintedâ [Her voice still heard as she retires. Rom. Foolish man, quoth I!âThe cunning jade Hath made a slip: it was a woman first. [A pause, and he stands musing and muttering to himself before he speaks aloud, then in a low smothered voice. Ay, and such thoughts Which in the breast had perish'd unreveal'd. Are by these cunning beldames brought to utterance. Words follow thoughts, acts follow words, and all The steps of infamy, from which the mind By nature shrinks, are thus familiar made: A blighting bane, corroding to their core Beauty and innocence. [Mimicking the voice of a nurse âMy dearest child! Thou needst not fear to tell thy thoughts to me; I know thy tender heart, I know thy fears.â Would the whole race were blasted from the earth! [In his own voice, and stamping on the ground. Enter Jerome. What brings thee here? Jer. Old Pietro is below, And craves to speak with you. Rom. The irksome fool! He trows that I am always in the humour To hear his prosing proverbs. Jer. He does, my lord; and oft presuming on it, Has grown familiar. Rom. Art thou his judge? Tell him I cannot see him now. To-morrow I'll find him in his cottage. Jer. But what he has to tell you, please you, sir, He bade me further add is of importance, And may not be delay'd. Rom. I'll see him, then, since it must needs be so. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An antechamber. Enter Pietro and a domestic. Pie. (speaking as he enters). A blessing on thy simple head! impatient! I have, good sooth! been wont to speak with him As though he were my fellow. Much shrewd counsel He hath received from me right pleasantly. He looks not grave or proud when poor men speak; At least I'm sure he was not so inclined Before he married. Enter Jerome behind him, and listens archly. Ay, he knows mankind, With all their knavish arts; ay, and he knows I know them also. Bless the day! full often He listen'd to me with a merry face: Much shrewd discoursing we have had together. Jer. (advancing). True, but such shrewd discoursing, as thou callst it, Should only upon rainy days take place, When idle folk, from field and sport debarr'd, Are glad to while away the weary time With aught to save the kicking of their heels. Pie. Will he not see me then? Jer. I said not so. He'll see thee presently; but do not tease him With a long-winded tale, choked up with saws; He is not in the humour for it now. It would, to say the least on't, be a present More prized by him who gives than who receives it. Pie. Go to! I have no need of thee to school me: I know as well as thou dost when to speak, And when to hold my tongue. Enter Romiero and Guzman, and the domestics withdraw. Rom. Good morrow, Pietro! thou wouldst speak with me. Pie. Yes, please your honour, I'm a simple man;â That is to say, I am not school'd or learn'd As many be, who set great store by it; But yet I think I can, as well as others, Scent mischief in its covert. Ah, good lack! This is a wicked world. Rom. I know it well. Thou'st told me so a thousand times, good Pietro. What is the matter now? Rehearse it briefly, And plainly too, my friend: enough of comment Will follow after. Speak,âwhat is the matter? Pie. Ay, something is the matter, take my word for't. For there be ill enough in this sad world,â In court and cot, in city and in village. Rom. (interrupting him impatiently). There is among your villagers, I hear, A person much afflicted. Pie. We were all well, both young and old of us, When I left home scarce half an hour since. No; My story is of other matters; villagers Are not therein concerned, unless it be As hired emissaries: for, I trow, No wealthy devil e'er lack'd poorer imp. No rich man ever wantsâ Rom. A truce with proverbs! What is it thou wouldst tell me? Pie. Marry, that mischief, in or near your castle, Is hatching secretly. Rom. Why dost thou think so? Pie. A ghost was seen by some benighted fools, As they report it, near the ancient chapel, Where light pour'd through the trees, and strangely vanish'd They know not how. I much suspect your ghosts. 'Tis said they're ominous of death; but weddings, Or worse than weddings oft'ner follow after. You have a rich and beauteous ward: Don Maurice Is young, ambitious, and cunning:âNo! It is no ghastly spectre haunts your woods. Rom. Was it a female form those fools beheld? Pie. Yes, by Saint Jago! and it wore, they say, Donna Zorada's air, who is, you know, Not much unlike, in size and gait, to Beatrice. Guz. We know all this already, worthy Pietro; Nought ill will follow it; be thou content. Rom. If Beatrice hath in the shades of night Gone forth to meet her lover, she hath err'd Beyond what we believed. (Calling loud.) Ho! Jerome there! Re-enter Jerome. Thou wert the secret agent of Don Maurice; In this thou'st sinn'd against thy master! Say, And I'll forgive thee all if thou speak truly, Did Donna Beatrice e'er, by night, steal forth To meet him in the forest? Jer. No, good my lord; that I will answer truly; She never did. Rom. Good Pietro tells a story Of frighten'd villagers, who have, at night, Seen wand'ring in the wood a female form. Thou seem'st confused; thou, too, hast heard of this? Jer. Not heard of it, my lord. Rom. Then thou hast seen it. Jer. I must confess I saw a form, last night, Glide hastily before me, through the wood: The face I could not see. Rom. It was a woman? Jer. It was, my lord. Rom. Its stature tall or short? Jer. Neither, my lord. Pie. Did I not say it seem'dâ Guz. (pulling Pietro back). Hush, thou art wise, and shouldst not waste thy words. Rom. (to Jerome). Did it resemble any female figure Familiar to thine eye? Why dost thou hesitate? Speak truth; speak freely; think not to deceive me: Seem'd it a form familiar to thine eye? Jer. I was confusedâI knew not. No, my lord, It was no well-known form. Rom. Thy words are false! [Walks perturbedly to and fro, then returning to them. Why stand ye here to gaze upon me? Go! Guz. (to Pietro). Retire, and do not speak to him again. Save thee, good Pietro; and thou, too, Jerome. [Exeunt Pietro and Jerome. (Going up to Romiero.) Thou art bereft of reason. In the dark A gliding form is seen, nor tall, nor short, Nor having any mark by which to prove It is, or is not any woman breathing; And thou in thy diseased conceit hast shapedâ Rom. Thou speakst in ignorance: I have good causeâ Cause which thou knowst not of. I'll tell thee more When I have breath to speak.â My dame, my wife, she whom I made my wife, Hath secret myst'riesâhath a beldame nurseâ Hath one conceal'd to whom she sendsâO shame!â Outrageous, frontless shame! the very picture Which I have gazed upon a thousand times, Tears in my eyes, and blessings on my lips. How little thought I onceâvain, vain remembrance! It is a thing most strange if she be honest. Guz. How strange?âthat thou thyself shouldst be deceived As many men have been, which is a marvel Of daily note, amongst the sons of Adam? Rom. Deceived! be there witch-powder in mine eyes, To make that seen which is not; in mine ears, To make them hear false sounds? I've seen; I've heard: I am deluded by no gossip's tale.â O would I were! I lovedâI worshipp'd her; She was the thing that stirr'd within my soul, Which had no other life. Despise me not; For tears will force their way.âShe was to meâ When I have power to speak, I'll tell thee all. Guz. Yes; pause awhile, my friend. Thou art too vehement. Rom. (lowering his voice). Have they o'erheard me? Has it come to this, That such as they should know my misery? I will match wiles with wiles, and borrow of her That damn'd hypocrisy. Come thou with me, And give me counsel: thou thyself wilt own It is no weak conceit disturbs me thus. But stop, and stand aside. [Stops on seeing nurse pass by a low window on the outside. Guz. What wouldst thou now? Rom. Here comes the beldame nurse of whom I spoke; Returning from her mission, as I guess. Stand thou aside whilst I engage with her, And, with her own deceits, deceive the witch. Do thou observe her visage as I speak. Guz. Nay; trust not to deceit; for at this moment Thou hast not o'er thyself as much control As would deceive the simplest soul on earth. She will outwit thee; leave the task to me, And do thou stand aside.âI hear her steps. Enter Nurse, while Romiero goes behind the arras. Ha! my good nurse; thou art a stirring person, And one of service in this family, If I mistake it not. How could fair damsels, And dainty dames, and other tender souls, Endure the thraldom of stern lords and masters, Brothers, and jealous guardians, and the like, Were it not for such useful friends as thou? Nurse. I know not what you mean by service, sir; I serve my mistress honestly and fairly. Guz. And secretly, when it must needs be so. Do I not know it well, and well approve Thy wary vigilance? Take this broad piece; (giving gold) A token of respect for all thy virtues. Thou art, I know, the agent of Zorada In all her secret charities: how fares it With that poor invalid? Nurse. What invalid? Guz. To whom thou tookst that basket of fair fruit. Let me attend thee when thou goest again; I have some skill in med'cine. Nurse. I thank you, sir; I have some skill myself, And that suffices. She will soon be well. Guz. It is a woman, then.âLook in my face: Look at me steadfastly.âI know it is not. It is a man; ay, and a man for whom Thy lady hath some secret, dear regard. And so, perhaps, hast thou: where is the harm? Nurse. And if there be, where is the harm of loving Those near akin to us? Guz. Yes, fairly said! Who can find harm in that? Nurse. Whom should we loveâI mean, whom should I love, But mine own flesh and blood? Guz. Thy flesh and blood! lies flesh and blood of thine So near us, and conceal'd?âA son, perhaps? Nurse. I have a son; but where he is conceal'd, Or far, or near, I know not. Guz. Nay, nay, good nurse; think of next month's confession, When lying must be paid for. Father Thomas For a small penance will not let thee off. [Here Romiero appears from behind the arras, with gestures of impatience, but draws back again. Guz. Knowst thou not where he is, this son of thine? A handsome youth, no doubt. Nurse. As ever stepp'd upon the blessed earth. When but an infant, he with fair Zorada Play'd like a brother. Such a pretty pair! And the sweet children loved each other dearly. Would he were here! but where he is I know not. Rom. (bursting out upon her). Vile wretch! thou liest; but thou shalt tell the truth. I'll press the breath from out thy cursed body, Unless thou tell me where thy son is hid. Nurse. My son, my lord! Rom. Ay, witch; I say thy son; The ugliest hound the sun e'er looked upon. Tell me, and instantly, if thou wouldst breathe Another moment. Tell me instantly. [Shaking her violently, while Guzman interposes, and Romiero, struggling with him, falls to the ground, and nurse escapes off the stage. Guz. (endeavouring to raise him). I pray thee, pardon me, my noble friend! When passion led thee to disgrace thyself, This was an act of friendship.âRise, Romiero. Rom. No; here upon the ground, my bed of agony, I will remain. Sunk to this deep disgrace, The centre of the earth were fitter for me Than its fair surface, and the light of heaven. Oh! this exceeds the worst imagination That e'er found entrance to this madden'd brain! That heâthis hateful, vulgar, shapeless creatureâ Fy, fy. Guz. If thou canst harbour such a thought, Thou art in verity beside thyself. It is not possible that such a one Could please Zorada, were she e'en unfaithful. Rom. (rising fiercely). Not please her! every thing will please a woman Who is bereft of virtue, gross, debased. Yea, black deformity will be to her A new and zestful object. Enter Zorada behind him. Guz. (making her a sign to retire). O lady! come not here. Zor. I heard Romiero loud; what is the matter? Rom. O nothing, madam; pray advance. O nothing! Nothing that you should be surprised to hear. That ladies can be fair and delicate, And to the world's eye e'en as saints devout, Yet all the while be coarse, debased, and stain'd With passions that disgrace the vulgar kmd. Zor. Alas! what mean you? Rom. Thou'st played me false; thou art a worthless woman; So base, so sunk, that those whose appellation Brings blushes to the cheeks of honest women Compared to thee are pure.âOff! do not speak! It is a sick'ning sight to look upon thee, Fair as thou art. Feign not to be surprised: Begone, I say, I cannot for a moment Say what I may not do. [Taking his dagger from his side, and giving it to Guzman, who snatches it hastily from him. Now thou art safe; but go, thou shameless creature Guz. Madam, I pray you go, for he is furious, And would not listen to a saint from heaven. [Exit Zorada, wringing her hands. Come, leave this spot, Romiero; some few hours, I am persuaded, will reveal this mystery. Meantime, let me constrain thee as a friend; Thou art not fit to speak or act with reason. Rom. Thinkst thou to bind and lead me like a maniac? Guz. Like what thou art: but here comes Beatrice. Wouldst thou to her expose thy sorry state? Enter Beatrice. Rom. To her or any one, what boot they now, Fair seemings and fair words? Bea. Are you not well, my lord? Rom. No, damsel; well was banish'd from the world, When woman came to it. Bea. Fy! say not so. For if deprived of women, what were men? Like leafless elms stripp'd of the clasping vine; Like unrigg'd barks, of sail and pennant bare; Like unstring'd viols, which yield no melody. Banish us all, and lay my life upon it, You will right quickly send for us again. Rom. Ay, as for parrots, jays, and kirtled apes, To make vain sport withal. It makes me sick To think of what you seem and what you are. Bea. But say not all, because there are a few. Guz. Fair lady, hold no further parley now. (To Rom.) And come with me, my friend. [Exeunt Romiero and Guzman. Bea. (looking after him). What strange tormenting fancy haunts him now? She leads a life worse than an Eastern slave, Who weds with such as he. Save me from that! Enter Maurice by the window, having previously peeped in to see if she were alone. Maur. Dear Beatrice! to find thee thus aloneâ Bea. Good heaven preserve us! What has brought thee back? Maur. To see and hear thee, love, and yet again To touch thy fair soft hand. Bea. An errand, truly, To make thee track thy steps so many miles! Maur. An errand worth the toil e'en ten times told. To see thy figure moving in thy veil, Is worth a course of five good miles at least; To see thy glowing face of welcome is, At lowest reck'ning, worth ten score of leagues By sea or land; and this soft thrilling pressure,â O! 'tis worth all the leagues that gird the globe. [Taking her hand. Bea. What idle words! how canst thou be so foolish? I needs must chide thee for it, thoughtless boy! Maur. Chide me, indeed, who am two years thy elder, And two good months to boot!âSuch high pretension! Have sixteen summers and a woman's robe Made thee so very wise and consequential? Bea. (giving him two mock blows on his shoulder). Take that, and that, for such discourteous words. Maur. (catching both her hands and kissing them separately). Ay, marry will I, and right gladly too, When this and this are added to the gift. Bea. Forbear such idle rapture, 'tis a folly: So tell me truly what has brought thee back To this disturb'd and miserable house. Maur. What, miserable still? Not yet convinced That thou, and not Zorada, art the queen Of my impassion'd heart? Bea. Of this, indeed, He is convinced; but what doth it avail? Some other fancy, yet I know not what, Again possesses him. Therefore depart; Quickly depart, nor linger longer here, When thou hast told me wherefore thou art come. Maur. When some way off, it came into my head That Don Romieroâthe occasion past, Which has excited him to favour usâ May be remiss, or may repent his promise. I therefore quickly turned my horse's head, Nor drew I bridle till within the forest I found me once again, close to the postern. Bea. What wouldst thou do? for in his present state Thou mayst not speak to him. Maur. But I would speak to Guzman; he has power To keep Romiero steadfast in his promise. I should have thought of this before I went, And urged him earnestly that no remissness With thy relations may retard our bliss. Bea. Are we not happy now? Is marriage bliss? I fear to think of it. Maur. Why shouldst thou fear? Shall I be jealous? O, my gentle Beatrice! I never will believe thee false to me, Until such proof as that heaven's sun is bright Shall flash upon me, and the agony Will be my death-blow and prevent upbraiding. Bea. And art thou, then, so tender in thy nature? In truth it makes me weep to think thou art. Maur. Let me wipe off those tears, my gentle love. Think hopefully and cheerfully, I pray thee. I feel within my breast a strong assurance Thou never wilt prove false, nor I suspicious. Where may I find Don Guzman? [Exeunt. ACT V. SCENE I. The scene dark; the forest. Enter Jerome and another domestic, by opposite sides of the stage. Jer. Hast thou seen any thing? Dom. No; but I spy a distant moving light Far to the left. Jer. Then run and see who bears it. [Exit domestic. Here come my lord and Guzman, slow and silent. Surely they have not seen it; and, perhaps, My comrade is deceived. Enter Romiero and Guzman. Rom. Ha! Jerome! is it thou! Jer. It is, my lord: Rom. Hast thou seen aught? hast thou heard any sound? Jer. Nothing, my lord. Rom. Yet still be on the watch: Revisit every path; let nought escape thee. Jer. No, nothing shall. I'll use both eyes and ears Intently; nothing shall unnoted be. An owlet shall not turn him in his nest But I shall be aware of it, nor hare Scud 'cross the path without my observation. Rom. Well, say no more: I trust thee. To thy duty! [Exit Jerome. Guz. I am persuaded we shall range this wood The livelong night, nor meet with any thing But such small denizens as Jerome mention'd, Or these benighted trees that skirt our path, So black and motionless. Rom. Oh! if the light of day return again, Nought being found to justify my fears, I'll hail it as the wretch whose op'ning dungeon Receives the light, as through its portal passes Some glad friend, bearing his reprieve. Oh, Guzman! The felon, chain'd to meet his shameful doom, Hath not more agony of thought, nor starteth With greater horror from the brink of death, Than I do from that moment of despair Which shall make manifest the thing I dread. Guz. I trust that moment never will arrive. Rom. Dost thou, my friend? dost thou, in very truth? I bless thee for that noble confidence: Would I could feel it too! Repeat thy words. Guz. I do believe that moment will not come. Rom. No, no! it was not thus: thy words are changed; Thy tone of voice is changed; thoughts of recoil Pass o'er thy mind, and turn their force to weakness. Thou dost not trust,âno, nor believe it neither. Guz. Indeed, I thinkâI hope thou art deceived. Rom. Shame on such timid tamp'ring with my passion, Provoking it the more! If she be guilty, I am prepared with dreadful preparation. If she be innocent,âtears choke my voice: To say, âif she be innocent!ââ Her look, her smile, her easy lightsome gait,â She was th'embodied form of innocence; The simple sweetness of a cottage child, Join'd to a lady's grace. Guz. Hers seem'd, indeed, the loveliness of virtue. Rom. Even so; but that is changed. She cannot now So look, so smile, so step; for if she could, I should defy all proof of circumstance To move me to suspicion. Guz. Nay, good Romiero, know thy nature better, A circumstance as trivial as the glance Or meaning smile of some young varlet page Would tempt thee to suspect a saint of heaven. But cease debate; your scout returns in haste. Enter Domestic. Dom. My lord, they're in the wood: I've seen them. Rom. Whom? Dom. The nurse, my lord, went first, and close behind her Donna Zorada stole like one afraid. Rom. (seizing him by the throat). Hell choke thy blasted breath, thou croaking fiend! Thou darest not say 'twas she. Dom. I did not say so, certainly. Rom. Thou didst. Dom. I spoke unwittingly; I will unsay it. Rom. (casting him away from him with violence). And be a damned liar for thy pains. All that my darkest fancy had conceived! Uncover'd shame, degrading infamy!â Come quick, unstinted, terrible revenge! If the base wantons live another hour, I am as base as they. Guz. Be not a maniac: think before thou act,â Before thou do what cannot be undone. Rom. Think ere I act! Cool, sober, gentle friend! Hadst thou not better say, âGood sir, be patient. Thy wife is faithless, and her minion bless'd; But pray, good sir, be patient.ââOh, my heart! The seat of life will burst ere it be done: Hold, hold till then! (To domestic.) Where were they? near the castle? Dom. No; in the beechen grove beyond the chapel, To which we did suspect their steps were bent, Taking, no doubt, that further winding path The better to avoid detection.âSee, There's light now faintly peering from its window. They must be there already. (To Guzman.) Look, Don Guzman! Guz. I do; it vanishes and re-appears, And vanishes again, and all is dark. Rom. Yes; all shall soon be dark: That flame of guilt, those glow-worms of the night, That bright deceitful sheen of foul corruption, Shall be extinct, trod out, earth bray'd with earth. Which of these paths leads to th' accursed spot? [Rushing into a path, and then turning back and taking another. I am bewilder'd! this will lead me right. [Exit. Guz. We must pursue his steps, and try, if possible, To keep his unrein'd ire from desp'rate acts. [Exeunt. Enter, by the opposite side, Beatrice and her woman. Bea. He should be here, or somewhere near this spot. I am afraid in these dark forest paths. Each crooked leafless stump or dwarfish bush Seems beast or man prepared to pounce upon us; And then to make a vain and short amends, Each slender, graceful sapling is my Maurice. I dare not venture further. Woman. Perhaps we're wrong, and have mista'en the place; Let us turn back, and try some other alley! Bea. Turn not; I hear his foot. (Listening.) Woman. My ears then must be dull, for I hear nothing. Bea. Yes, they are dull; thou hast not in thy heart That which doth quicken mine.âIt is his footstep; I know it well! Woman. Indeed, I should have guess'dâ Bea. Nay, hush, Theresa; I love to bend mine ear and listen to it. [Listens again as before, and presently enter Maurice. Is't thou, my friend? Maur. Yes, dearest; further on I waited for thee, and became impatient. Bea. How glad I am to hear thy voice again! Maur. What hast thou done? How hast thou sped with Guzman? Since thou wouldst take that office on thyself, I trust thy parley with him was successful. Bea. As heart could wish, although it was but short. He'll be our friend, and keep Romiero so; And will, besides, to my stern uncle speak, Who, as thou knowstâBut here comes one in haste. Enter Jerome. Jer. Remain no longer here; for Don Romiero, And Guzman with him, wanders through the wood; You may encounter him in any path. Maur. What shall we do? Jer. Be still, and follow me, And I will lead you to a safer spot, Free from intrusion, near the ruin'd chapel. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The inner porch of a ruined chapel. Enter Nurse and a Sea Captain, meeting. Nurse. Are all things ready then? Capt. The breeze is faint, But it is fair; my seamen are on board; We shall weigh anchor by the early dawn, And bear us out to sea. Go, tell my passenger To join us presently upon the beach. Nurse. I will, good captain: 'tis no thoughtless youth, Who trows the very winds should wait his bidding; He will be punctual. He hath seen good days, Although I may not tell thee who he is. Capt. Nor do I ask thee. Nurse. He hath seen good days, And evil too, and hath been buffeted By wayward fate. Capt. Good mother, so have I. But what of that? The foul, the fair will blow, And we must weather it even as we may. Speak not in such a lamentable tone; I will be kind to him. Nurse. I hope thou wilt. Heaven will reward thee, and Saint Jago too. Capt. Tut, woman! wherefore make so much ado About some kindness to a fellow sinner? I shall expect him ere the morning break; And give him notice, for the time is near. [Exit. Nurse (alone). I will not yet break on their sad farewell, But in the outer porch remain on watch. Ah, woe the day! that they must thus, by stealth, Take their last leave. I fear 'twill be their last. [Exit. SCENE III. An old Gothic chapel: Sebastian and Zorada are discovered in earnest conversation. Seb. And wilt thou bear these lessons in thy mind? Zor. I shall forget to say my daily prayers When I forget to think of thee, dear father! And, when I think of thee, thy words of kindness, And words of counsel too, shall be remember'd. Seb. Sweet child! stand back and let me look upon thee. Ay; so she look'd. O! it is sweet in thee To look so like thy mother, when mine eyes Must take their last impression, as a treasure Here (his hand on his heart) to be cell'd for ever. Many looks Thy varying face was wont to wear, yet never, But in some sad or pensive mood, assumed The likeness of that countenance;âto me Thy loveliest look; though, to all other eyes, Thy mother's beauty never equall'd thine. Zor. I still remember her: the sweetest face That e'er I look'd upon. I oft recall it, And strive to trace the features more distinctly. Seb. Be good as she was; and when I am gone, Never again let myst'ry and concealment, Tempting the weakness of thy husband's nature, Which but for this were noble, break the peace And harmony of marriage.âFor this oathâ This fatal oathâhe was constrain'd to take it. Then so consider it, nor let it rankle Within thy gentle breast: that were perverse. When I am gone, all will again be well, And I will write to thee and comfort thee. Our minds shall still hold intercourse, dear Zada, And that should satisfy. Zor. Alas! alas! When I shall read thy letters, my poor heart Will but the more yearn after thee, dear father! And pine to see thee. Suffer me to hope That we shall meet again.âCall it not vain, But suffer me to thinkâ Enter Nurse in alarm. What is the matter? Nurse. You are discover'd: Don Romiero comes; I heard his voice approaching through the trees. I heard the hollow tread of many feet. Zor. (to Sebastian). O fly! farewell! Seb. Farewell, my dearest child! Heaven bless and guard thee ever! O farewell! [Embraces her, and exit. Zor. If he should be discover'd! Nurse. Fear it not. He knows the nearest path, and on the beach The captain will receive him. Ere 'tis light, He will be safely in the vessel lodged. O all good saints of heav'n! he's here already. Enter Romiero. Rom. Most wretched and degraded woman! Now Thy shameful secret is discover'd. Now, Vice unveiled and detestable must have Its dreadful recompense. Where is thy minion? Zor. O cease! you frighten me with such fierce looks. I have done thee no wrong. Rom. Provoke me not with oft-repeated words, Which I do know are false as his who fell Apostate and accursed. Where is thy minion? [In a still louder voice, and stamping on the ground. Tell me without delay: speak briefly, truly, If thou hast hope to live another hour. Zor. O pity, pity! be not so enraged! Thou shalt be told the truth a few hours hence; Then, to that time, detest me as thou wilt, But spare my life. Re-enter Sebastian, while Romiero has, in his rage, stridden to the front of the stage. Zorada, uttering a shriek, runs to her father, and throws her veil over his face, endeavouring to push him back. Seb. What! fly and leave thee in a madman's power? I heard his stormy voice, and could not leave thee. [Romiero turns round, and, running furiously at them, stabs Zorada in aiming at Sebastian; Guzman, who enters in alarm, followed by Maurice and Beatrice, endeavouring, in vain, to prevent him. Guz. Hold! hold! thou wilt not strike a cover'd foe! Zor. (still clinging round her father). Strike me again; I will not quit my hold. I'll cling to him; within my dying grasp I'll hold him safe: thou wilt not kill him there. [Sinking to the ground, while the veil drops from the face of Sebastian. Rom. Her father! Zor. Yes; my father, dear Romiero! Thou wilt not slay us both. Let one suffice! Thou lovedst me once; I know thou lovest me now; Shall blood so dear to thee be shed in vain? Let it redeem my father!âI am faint, Else I would kneel to thee. [Endeavouring to kneel, but prevented and supported by nurse and Beatrice. Nurse. Do not, dear murder'd child! Bea. My dear, dear friend, forbear. He heeds thee not. Guz. Romiero, dost thou hear her sad request? Rom. I hear your voices murm'ring in mine ear Confused and dismal. Words I comprehend not. What have I done? Some dreadful thing, I fear. It is delusion this! she is not slain: Some horrible delusion. Zor. (aside to Sebastian). Fly, fly, dear father, while he is so wild. He will not know and will not follow thee. Seb. No, dearest child! let death come when it will, I'll now receive it thankfully. Romiero, Thou wretched murd'rer of thy spotless wifeâ Romiero de Cardona! Rom. Who is it calls me with that bitter voice? [Gazing on him; and then with a violent gesture of despair. I know thee;âyes, I know what I have done. Guz. Forbear such wild and frantic sorrow now, And speak to her while she is sensible, And can receive thy words. She looks on thee, And looks imploringly. Rom. Zorada, my Zorada! spotless saint! I lov'd thee far beyond all earthly things, But demons have been dealing with my soul, And I have been thy tyrant and destroyer, A wretch bereft of reason. Bea. She makes a sign as if she fain would speak, But her parch'd tongue refuses. (To Maurice.) Fetch some water To moisten those dear lips and cool that brow. [Exit Maurice. She strives again to speak. Rom. (stooping over her.) What wouldst thou say? What means that gentle motion? Zor. Come close to me; thou'rt pardon'd, love, thou'rt pardoned. Rom. No, say that I am blasted, ruin'd, cursed, Hateful to God and man. Re-enter Maurice with water, which she tastes. Zor. Thou art not cursed; O no! then be more calm. (Endeavouring to raise herself up.) Look here; he is my father: think of that. Thou'rt pardoned, love; thou'rt pardoned. Rom. She call'd me love. Did she not call me so? Guz. Yes, most endearingly. Rom. And she is gone, and I have murder'd her! [Throws himself on the body, moaning piteously; then starts up in despair, and looks furiously at Sebastian. Thou restless, selfish, proud, rebellious spirit! Thy pride has work'd our ruin, been our bane; The bane of love so bless'd! Draw, wretched man! I've sworn an oath, which I will sacred hold, That when Sebastian and myself should meet, He should to royal justice be deliver'd, Or, failing that, one of the twain should die. [Drawing his sword fiercely upon him. Guz. (holding him back). Hold, madman, hold! thy rage is cruel, monstrous, Outraging holy nature. Rom. (breaking from him.) Off! thinkst thou to restrain or bind despair With petty strength like thine?âProud rebel, draw! I am thy daughter's murderer, and thou Destroyer of us both. Seb. Yes, Don Romiero, we are match'd in ruin, And we will fight for that which cures despair. He who shall gain it is the conqueror. [They fight, each exposing himself rather than attacking his adversary. Rom. No; to't in earnest, if thou wouldst not have me Deliver thee a felon to the law. Defend thine honour, though thou scorn thy life! [They fight again, and Romiero falls. I thank thee, brave Sebastian: O forgive Harsh words that were but meant to urge contention. Thou'rt brave and noble; so my heart still deem'd thee, Though, by hard fate, compelled to be thy foe.â Come hither, Guzman: thou hast sworn no oath. Give me thy hand; preserve Sebastian's life, And lay me in the grave with my Zorada. [The curtain drops. HENRIQUEZ: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN The King of Castile (Alonzo, surnamed the Noble). Don Henriquez, his general. Don Carlos, a noble soldier, attached to Henriquez. Antonio, a young gentleman in love with Mencia. Balthazar. Blas, a youth in the service of Leonora. A Friar, confessor to Henriquez. Diego, steward to Henriquez. Courtiers, confessors, attendants, gaolers, &amp;c.WOMEN Leonora, wife of Henriquez. Mencia, sister to Leonora. Inez, an attendant of Leonora. Scene, the castle of Henriquez, a few leagues from the town of Zamora, and in the said town. Time, the beginning of the 13th century. ACT I. SCENE I. A grove near the castle. Enter Diego with a letter, muttering to himself before he speaks aloud. Diego. The honour of the house of Altavera, Of all those chiefs, whose bread I and my sires So many years have eaten without reproach, Must it be sullied now?âDiego Furnez Must take upon him, then, th' informer's office, With all its paltry baseness and concealment. To Altavera's lords, with manly freedom, My fathers spoke, and so have I. But then I did oppose this marriage which hath sunk His noble pride so low. Such information From me would be suspected; and his anger, When so excited, might, perhaps,âa blow! Diego Furnez could not live disgraced, And, dying unrevenged, would die disgraced. Ay, it must be; necessity compels me. Lays down the letter, then looking hastily about, snatches it up again. Surely I hear a stranger's voice approaching. I'll drop it farther on, and watch my time, When Don Henriquez may be sure to find it. [Exit. Enter Antonio and Mencia, speaking as they enter. Ant. Forget thee, Mencia! Yes, I will forget thee When means are found to make it possible. Thine image, independent of my will, Where'er I am, is with me; night and day Before my fancy's eye it smiles or weeps; Motions its arms, as thou wert wont to do, When distance barr'd our intercourse of words; Is present with me more than present things; And makes my wretched life a maniac's dream, Lost and unprofitable. Is there some potent spell to lay this sprite That haunts me to my ruin? Vain, vain words! Thou canst not be forgotten. Men. Thou but deceiv'st thyself: there are two spells, Absence and time, which have to many a lover His peace restored. Fate has between us now A barrier placed, which all my feeble strength Could not o'erleap; therefore I have consented. Ant. Consented! O to what hast thou consented? To more than the rejecting of my love, Which thy ambitious sister, since the day That raised her, as the wife of Don Henriquez, To greatness, which she knows not how to bear, Regards as too presumptuous. Thou art silent. To more than this hast thou consented, Mencia? Men. Question me not; I cannot tell thee now; Yet thou shouldst know. I have, alas! I have, O'ercome by prayers, and wearied with contention, Consented to bestow my luckless hand On one who tried, but could not win my heart: And I am boundâ Ant. Thou art not! no, thou art not! Men. Alas, I am! and so will hold myself. Ant. Thou shalt not! Holdst thou sacred every tie, But those that bind thee to thy earliest friend; To him who was thy playmate and thy guard; Who through thy native woods ran by thy side; Play'd with thee, sang with thee, built thy first bower, Where thou, his mimic mistress, kept thy state, Screen'd from the mid-day sun, when he, the while, Still pleased thee, as thou lentst thine eager ear, With tales of wonderment and tales of love? All claims but his! O say not so, sweet Mencia! Let me implore thee on my bended knee! Men. Hush! rise! we are observed; this spot is now Traversed by busy feet, in preparation For a gay feast to-night, held at the castle, In honour of Henriquez' safe return. Leave me, I pray! Ant. By unfrequented paths, Through rugged wilds I've travelled many a league: Three irksome days and nights in that deep grove, The ruin of an ancient sepulchre, Like some unhallow'd spirit, I have haunted To watch a lucky moment when thy steps Should lead thee near the place; and having found thee, Thinkst thou to cast me off with fev'rish haste, As thou wouldst shake an adder from thy robe? Men. Nay, nay! for yonder Don Henriquez comes; There's danger here. Ant. And come who will, and let what will betide, Despair thinks not of danger. Men. Retire, retire, and we shall meet again. Ant. When? where? this night? to-morrow? name the time. Men. To-morrow by the early dawn I'll meet thee. No; not to-morrow, but the following morn. Ant. And at that early hour? Men. Even so: retire. Ant. I have thy word for this? Men. Thou hast, thou hast. [Exit Antonio. (Alone.) Ay, he has loved me as no other will, And thus he is requited. Woe the day! Why did my timid spirit yield so poorly To an ambitious sister?âMust it be? Henriquez is a man whose native feelings Of honour and of justice rise indignant Against the slightest breach of honest faith. The interests of his house to him were nothing Opposed to generous tiesâto simple right. I will to himâah, no! I dare not do it. (Looking out.) He is at hand. That paper keeps his eye Intently occupied.âWhat can it be? Perhaps some letter dropp'd by poor Antonio, And then all is discover'd. Enter Henriquez. You twist that letter in your hand, my lord, As a most worthless thing. May I presume? I am not curious. Hen. Yet thou hast a mind, Not being curious, just to peep into it. Well; it might case thy silken threads, perhaps, Or wrap thy scented comfits. Take it then. [Offering her the letter, and then drawing it back. No; spells lurk in such crooked lines as these To work unhappy fancies out of nothing. Perhaps same hateful witch has mutter'd o'er it Her blasting benison; thou shalt not have it: I'll put it up to light my ev'ning lamp. Thou goest? Men. I have been too long truant here, And my neglected task calls me within. [Exit. Hen. (alone). Why look I still upon this foolish scroll? As foolish as 'tis spiteful. Leonora Has for her wicked solace in my absence My noble friendâmy second self received! Good likely tale! [Reads again. âAn unknown friend cautions thee to beware of Don Juan. He has played thee false in thine absence, and destroyed thy wife's virtue and thine own honour. Look to it, if thou wouldst not become the most contemptible of all doating husbands: for thy fond security will make them bold, and the world will point at thee ere long.â The common cant of all those friends unknown. Juan and Leonora! blest, most blest, In friendship and in love! This canker'd fiend Is stung therewith. Envy most devilish, Yet not uncommon in this wicked world. Well; it shall serve to light my evening lamp; God mend the wretch who wrote it. [Exit. SCENE II. A small ornamented apartment in the castle. Enter Blas and Inez, carrying different things in their hands, speaking as they enter. Inez. I leave thee too these cases of perfume, And this small book of tales and warlike sports. Place them as I have said, and be thou secret: Be sure thou tell to no one for what guest This chamber is prepared. Blas. But if I should, I should not break my word. I guess'd it out myself; thou didst not trust me. Inez. Yes, but I did confirm thy guess, more surely To rivet thee to secrecy. Thy lady Will greatly be displeased, shouldst thou divulge it; Therefore be prudent.âWhen thy task is done, Thou'lt find me in the lower corridor. [Exit. Blas. (murmuring to himself). Be secret, tell to no one, and thy lady Will greatly be displeased! What is't to me? And yet I do not like this strange concealment. [Employs himself in arranging different things, whilst he sings part of an old ballad. SONG. The watch-dog bays from the southern wall, And hounds and spaniels repeat his call; The warders in the court are speaking, The merlins on their perch are shrieking. The dame she started from her seat, And her lover's heart did quickly beat. âThe wall is gain'd, the drawbridge crost, Your lord is return'd, and we are lost.â âNay, fie upon thy witless fear! See, quickly don this woman's gear; And boldly cross the crowded hall, 'Mid serfs and grooms and spearmen all. âThey with glad greetings are, I trow, Too busy by far to heed thee now; Yet word or answer give to none, But straight to the portal and swiftly be gone.â The dame put on her joyous face, And she welcomed her lord with a hearty embrace. Quoth she to herself, âSome warlike fray Will call him forth another day.â A fray full soon hath called him forth, And he is gone to the restless north; But heâbeshrew the wayward wight! Returns again at the dead of night. The lover's face turn'd cold and pale, But never a whit did the lady quail. âA friar's cowl and frock thou'lt find Securely pent that chest behind: âBe thou a friar instantly, And to the castle's chapel fly, And in the pale lamp's flickering shine, Bend lowly at Saint Martin's shrine.â Enter Henriquez. Hen. And is it thou, good Blas, who singst so well? I heard thee as I cross'd the gallery, And was led hither by the well-known tune That, when a boy, I have so often heard. But cease not; sing the rest of that old story. Blas. In sooth, my lord, I have forgot the rhymes. Hen. But canst thou not, without the rhymes, remember The third escape which for her lawless lover The wily dame devised? Blas. Yes, in a groom's attire she sent him forth To hold her husband's stirrup at the gate, As he alighted from his warlike barb. Hen. Was not her simple lord at length revenged? And how was that, I pray? Blas. She had a step-son, who from Palestine Return'd, and hearing of his father's wrongs, Swore to revenge them. Hen. E'en so; I now remember it distinctly, And the concluding lines sound in my ears. They fought in the portal, They fought in the tower, They fought in the hall, and the lady's high bower, There they struggled and fought, till the lady at last, A pale bleeding corse, from the lattice was cast. Ay, many a time I've listened to that ditty: She was a wicked dame of whom it tells. Thinkst thou the rhymester knew of such a one? Or be there any such? Blas. I do not know: there mayâand there may not. Hen. May, or may not! thou needst not blush so deeply. What's thy employment here? Some new arrangement. Thy lady's private closet so disturb'd! Ay, and this curtain'd couch!âFor whom, I pray, Prepare ye this, good Blas? Blas. I do not know, my lord. Hen. Thou dost not know! Why dost thou blush so strangely as thou speakst? Compose thyself; I do not seek to know. What scented thing is this? it smells most sweetly. Blas. It is a box of aromatic gums. Hen. It needs must be some dainty fair, for whom Such delicacies are provided. Ay, And learned too, I guess, for here are books. A soldier's book! (Turning over its leaves.) Ha! 'tis mine own old friend. Blas. His name is then upon it. Hen. Thou seemst alarm'd, methinks: how's this? whose name? Blas. I do not know, my lord. Your own old friend. Hen. It was the book I call'd so: in my youth It was my favourite study. Blas. I had forgot; the book is yours, my lord, And only borrow'd now for his amusement. Hen. For her's, thou meanst: is't not a female guest? Blushing again! What mystery is here? Tell me for whom this chamber is prepared. [Pause. Thou wilt not answer. Nay, I will not force thee; But tell me onlyâis this guest a woman? What! silent still! 'tis not a woman then? Blas. No, good my lord. Hen. Some fav'rite page, perhaps, who for the night Must near his dame be lodged?âIt is not this? I do command thee tell me who it is; [Taking hold of him roughly. For by thy face I see too well thou knowest. What guest sleeps here to-night? Blas. Don Juan is the guest; this is the room Where he is wont to sleep. Hen. Is wont to sleep! Has he been here of late? Blas. 'Tis said he has been here; for me, I know not. [Henriquez, turning slowly from him, walks to the bottom of the stage. Blas (aside, looking after him). Surely he heard my words; yet calm and silent! No further question following my reply! Fool that I was to be so much afraid, Since he regards it lightly. Hen. (returning). Where is thy lady? Blas. She gives directions in the pillar'd hall; At least I left her there a short time since. Hen. Go, see, and bring me word. [Exit Blas. Question a youthâa menialâany one, Of what regards the honour of my wife! I married her in the full confidence That she possess'd all good and noble virtues Which should become a brave Castilian's wife, And from herself alone will I be certified Of what this hateful mystery imports. [After a pause, and then muttering indistinct words. Peace, bad suggestions, from mean baseness sprung! No! till I hear from her own falt'ring tongue The glossing poor pretences of the guilty, And see upon her once ingenuous face The varied hues of shame, I'll not believe it. I am a fool to take it so intently. This casket here, which was my earliest gift! And does it still contain that golden heart, The token of my love? I fain would know. [Looking at it near, and taking it in his hands. It is not lock'd; the lid is slightly latch'd: In mine own house, methinks, without reproach, I may undo the bauble. (Opens it.) What is here? Don Juan's picture, and a letter, too; I know the writing well. [Reads. âDear mistress of my soul! How shall I thank thee for that favour which has raised me from despair! Though thy heart has not always been mine, and I have sighed long to subdue it, yet I cherish my present felicity as if thou hadst loved me always, and no other had ever touched thy heart. I will come to the feast as a masquer, and for the reason suggested to me, unknown to Henriquez. The bearer of this will return with the key of the private door to the grove, and I shall come through the narrow path about nightfall.â (After a pause.) Things have been done, that, to the honest mind, Did seem as adverse and impossible, As if the very centre cope of heaven Should kiss the nether deep. And this man was my friend! To whom my soul, shut from all men besides, Was free and artless as an infant's love, Telling its guileless faults in simple trust. Oh the coil'd snake! It presses on me here (His hand on his heart) as it would stop the centre throb of life. [Returning to the casket, and taking out other papers. And sonnets, too, made on her matchless beauty, Named Celia, as his cruel shepherdess. Ay; she was matchless, and it seems was cruel, Till his infernal arts subdued her virtue. I'll read no more. What said he in the letter? [Reads again. âThe bearer will return with the key, and I'll come by the path at nightfall.â Night falls on some who never see the morn. Re-enter Blas. Blas. My lord, I've found her: Donna Leonora Has bid me say she will be with you instantly. Hen. I cannot see her now: I am not well. I shall be better shortly: tell her so. I'll rest me in my chamber for an hour, And would not be disturb'd. Prevent her coming; And say I would repose. Go, tell her quickly. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Enter Leonora and Mencia, followed by Diego, speaking as they enter. Diego. It shall be done; I understand you, madam; Those lofty plumes must grace the seat of honour, The chair of Don Henriquez. Leo. Yes; and the chair of Don Henriquez' wife: See that they both be graced. Diego. Never but once, (Lady, forgive the freedom of my words,) Never but once before was chair of state Beneath this roof so crested: years gone by, When Don Henriquez' father, from the king, Held in these parts, then threaten'd with commotions, A regent's power. And then his noble lady, Although the blood of kings ran in her veins, Did at due distance humbly take her place On a low stool, unmark'd by any honour. Leo. Ay, good Diego, such meek humble dames Have lived, as we are told, in former days. Do as I have desired thee. Diego (aside, murmuring as he goes out). Lofty dame! Making so proud a stir, like some pert hedgeling, Chirping and flutt'ring in an eagle's nest. [Exit. Men. Sister, you aggravate the mark'd dislike That old domestic bears you: be more gentle. Leo. O he dislikes me not; it is his humour. Dislike me! Have I not to him and his Been even profuse in gifts? The foolish thought! Men. Ay; but the meekness of his former lady, She, too, who had a king's blood in her veins, Dwells in his heart, and beggars all thy gifts. Leo. Thou'rt fanciful. Men. Nay, nay! and why so fond Of splendid pomp? Compared to what thou wast, Thy marriage with Henriquez made thee great; This doth not make thee greater; woe the day! Nor happier neither. Leo. Woe the day! Poor dove! That would beneath the cottage eaves for ever Sit moping in the shade with household birds, Nor spread thy silver plumage to the sun. Men. The sun hath scorch'd my wings, which were not made For such high soaring. He who would raise me to his nobler rank Will soon perceive that I but grace it poorly. Leo. Away with such benumbing diffidence! Let buoyant fancy first bear up thy merit, And fortune and the world's applause will soon Support the freight. When first I saw Henriquez, Though but the daughter of a humble house, I felt the simple band of meadow flowers That bound my hair give to my glowing temples The pressure of a princely coronet. I felt me worthy of his love, nor doubted That I should win his heart, and wear it too. Men. Thou dost, indeed, reign in his heart triumphant; Long may thy influence last. Leo. And fear not but it will. These pageantries Give to the even bliss of wedded love A varied vivifying power, which else Might die of very sloth. And for myself, My love for him, returning from the wars, Blazon'd with honours, as he now returns, Is livelier, happier, and, methinks, more ardent, Than when we first were married. Be assured All things will favour thee, if thou hast spirit To think it so shall be. Thou shak'st thy head. It is not reason, but thy humble wish, Thy low ignoble passion that deceives thee, And conjures up those fears. Weak wav'ring girl! Art thou not bound? Men. Weakness in yielding to your will, indeed, Has fetter'd me with bands my heart disowns. Leo. Fy! say not so. Hush! let not that sad face O'ercloud the joy my gen'rous lord will feel, When he discovers what we have conceal'd, With playful art, to make his joy the keener. Hush! here comes Blas again. Enter Blas. How is my lord? Will he not see me now? Blas. He will not yet. I have been watching near his chamber door, And when I gently knock'd, as you desired, He answer'd me with an impatient voice, Saying his head was drowsy, and lack'd rest. Leo. I'll go myself. Blas. Nay, madam, do not yet. I guess that some cross humour has disturb'd him; Sleep will compose it. Leo. Humour, dost thou say! He ne'er was cross with me. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. The private apartment of Henriquez, with his chair and table, and a lamp burning on the table; the stage lighted only by this lamp. Enter Henriquez with a sword in his hand, which he lays on the table in the light, shrinking back as he looks at it. Hen. The blood!âthis blood!âhis blood!âO dismal change! When rose the sun of this sad day; how gladly Would I have shed mine own, to have sav'd one drop Of what was then so dear! (Pushing it into the shade.) Be from my sight! It wrings my heart: and yet so black a stream, So base, so treacherous, did never stain The sword of holy justice. (After sitting down, and gazing some time on the ground.) This is a pause of rest from the first act, The needful act of righteous retribution. Oh! is it rest? The souls that fell from light Into the dark profound, cut off from bliss, Had rest like this. (Pressing his temples tightly with both hands.) How furiously these burning temples throb! Be still! be still! there's more behind to do; But no more blood: I will not shed her blood. (Knocking at the door.) Who's there? Voice. Are you awake, my lord? Hen. What dost thou want? Voice (without). The banquet is prepared, the guests assembled, Your grooms are waiting, and your vestments ready. Will you not please, my lord, to let them enter? Hen. (to himself). The guests assembled! Vile bewild'ring dream! I had forgot all this. I must appear. Voice (without). Will you be pleased, my lord, to let them enter? Hen. Be stillâbe still; I'll open to them presently. [Exit hastily into an inner chamber, taking the sword with him. SCENE II. The grand hall of the castle lighted up magnificently. Leonora, Mencia, Carlos, and company discovered; music, which presently ceases, and Enter a Servant. Leo. (aside to servant). How is thy master? Has he left his chamber? Serv. (aside to Leonora). Yes; he will soon appear; he is preparing. Leo. (aloud). Indeed, indeed, I have been much concern'd That Don Henriquez has, from sudden illness, Been tardy in respect to noble guests Whom he so truly honours; but I hopeâ (Flourish of trumpets.) Ha! who is this? Some guest in princely state. Enter Servant. Serv. The king is at the gate. Leo. The king! a great surprise! unlooked-for honour! I'll to the gate. (To the music.) Strike up a royal welcome! [Exeunt Leonora, Carlos, and others, while the music plays a grand martial air; then Re-enter Leonora, &amp;c., conducting the King, attended, who receives the homage, and continues speaking in dumb-show to many of the company, till the music ceases. King (to Leonora). Fair hostess, I am come in homely trim For such a gay assembly. Leo. Your poor servants Are greatly honour'd by this condescension; A glad surprise, so far beyond our hopes. King. Ay, and beyond mine own, fair dame; but finding From wrecks of mountain torrents, or neglect, The straight road to Zamora was impassable, I took the wider compass, and proceeding Through these domains by favour of the night, Your castle from its woods look'd temptingly, And beckon'd me afar to turn aside. The light from every lattice gaily stream'd, Lamps starr'd each dusky corridor, and torches Did from the courts beneath cast up the glare Of glowing flame upon the buttress'd walls And battlements, whilst the high towers aloft Show'd their jagg'd pinnacles in icy coldness, Clothed with the moon's pale beam. âIt pleased my fancy; And here I am, a hasty visitor, Who must Zamora reach by early day; Where many a lofty lord, and learned clerk, And all the rogues and robbers of the district Await my coming. Car. All of them, my liege? King. I spoke at random, like a graceless layman: More than the church's portion were presumption, A tithe of them will do.âHere is Henriquez. Enter Henriquez, richly dressed. Hen. My humble homage to your highness: welcome To my poor house, so honour'd by your presence. King. I thank thee, brave Henriquez, but I fear 'Tis an untimely visit; thou'rt unwell. Hen. Nought but a passing ailment; do not name it. King. In faith your face is wan, and strangely changed, And would become a sober beadsman's frock More than a festive mantle. How is't with you? Retire again to rest. Hen. My face speaks falsely, I am much recover'd. Here is the cup of welcome; will your grace Be pleased to honour me. [Taking a cup from a servant, and presenting it on one knee to the King. King. All good be on your head, and this fair dame's! [Bowing to Henriquez and Leonora, and then drinking. Fair ladies and brave lords, well be ye all! [Bowing to the company, and drinking again. Hen. (to the servant, who is pouring out a cup for him). Up; fill it to the brim. Health to the king, and a long happy reign! [Drinks. To all my honour'd guests health and good welcome! [Drinks again. King. A goodly company: here are, methinks, High blood enough, plumed hats and coronets, To furnish out a court. Leo. They honour this poor feast which I have fashion'd. To grace my lord's return. King. You have done well; and I should grace it too, Who was the greatest gainer by his absence, When he with brave companions like himself Against the Moors did for the state good service, As Alcantara, by their valour won, And now a noble hold for Christian knights, Can nobly testify. I speak not of the Navas de Tolosa, Where he upon that memorable day Broke through the Moslem chain of armed guards, Changing their strength to slaughter and dismay: We are too apt to speak of recent services. Former or recent, would I could repay them! Hen. Your bounty has already done it nobly. King. Fy, fy! a trifle; what would scarce maintain A rustic lord, who dozes life away In his porch'd hall, where hawks wink on the perch, And hounds lie sleeping round him. Take this ring: My royal father wore it many a day; And whatsoe'er thou shalt request of me, Returning to my hand this pledge again, It shall be granted, were it half the realm. Hen. (receiving it on his knee). I thus receive it with all humble duty. [Rising with forced animation. But let us now be gay: the time wears on. By early dawn I must attend your highness, To reach Zamora by th' appointed hour. Leo. I am rejoiced to see you so recovered. [To Henriquez. Hen. I thank you, lady; let your guests receive Your present courtesies.âWhere are the minstrels? Let them strike up a dance: we are too still. Leo. Doubt not we shall be gay; but we expect Some merry masquers here to join our revels; They should have come ere now. Hen. Wait ye for such? Are they not come already? Leo. How so, my lord? Hen. The world is full of them: Who knows the honest unclothed worth of those That by your side may stand, drink from your cup, Or in your bosom lie? We are all masquers. King. Your wine has cheer'd you to a gibing humour; You are severe, my lord, on this poor world. Hen. If I have said amiss, e'en let it pass: A foolish rev'ller may at random speak: Who heeds his idle words?âMusic strike up. [Music; the King retires with Henriquez to the bottom of the stage, and the guests prepare to dance, when Blas with a face of horror enters the hall, and beckons Carlos aside. Car. What dost thou want? Blas. A fearful thing has happen'd; And to my lord, or Donna Leonora, It may not hastily be told. Car. What is't? Blas. A murder'd body near the castle lies, But newly slain; and they who found it swear (For well they know his form and countenance), It is Don Juan's body. Leo. (who has stolen near them to listen). Don Juan's body, saidst thou? Is he dead? Blas. Yes, madam, they have found him in the wood Lifeless andâ Leo. Oh, I guess thy horrid look! And he is murder'd? Dreadful, barbarous deed! [Exclaiming aloud. [All quit their places for the dance, and crowd round Leonora, who is supported by Mencia, appearing also affected, whilst Henriquez, at a distance, observes them intently. Leo. (recovering). O Carlos! tell my lord the horrid tale. I must retire. [Exit with Mencia and other ladies. King (coming forward with Henriquez). Some strange commotion here! Hen. (to Carlos). What has befallen? Car. What will most keenly rend your noble heart; Yet to a soldier I should tell it plainly: Don Juan, from some secret villain's stroke, Has met his fate this night, and near your walls. Hen. Away! Howl not so wild a dirge to me: Far distant from these walls, full many a league, Don Juan surely is. Ye are deceived. Blas (shaking his head). No, no! O no! Car. I fear he tells us true. Hen. He wrote to me, not many days ago, A letter, dated from his northern seat, Which made no mention of his visit here: If what you say be true, it is most strange. I'll be assured if it, indeed, be so. [Going hastily. Car. (preventing him). Retire, and I will see it ascertain'd: You shall not look upon so sad a sight. King (to Henriquez). Retire, my lord: it were not fit you went. Your noble guests beseech you to retire. Hen. I will obey your grace. I thank ye all. [Exeunt Henriquez and Carlos severally. King (to the guests). Were it not well that we should all retire? Our banquet to a funeral wake is turn'd, And cannot cheer us now. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An inner court of the castle, lighted by a lamp over the gateway, the stage otherwise dark. Enter Diego and two servants, with dark lanterns, speaking loud and confusedly as they enter. 1st serv. I could be sworn to it. Go tell my lord: Why hold we here such idle altercation? Diego. He must not be disturbed. 1st serv. How not disturbed? Enter Carlos above, looking down from an open corridor. Car. Ho! who are ye who talk so eagerly? What is the matter? 1st serv. The murderer is found: come down, Don Carlos! For we would fain pursue him through the wood, But thus unarm'd we dare not. [Exit Carlos above. 2d serv. Ay, he is coming: he will be our warrant, And tell us what to do. Re-enter Carlos below. Car. Well, friends, what did you say? the murderer? 1st serv. Yes; I can swear 'tis so: I would have followed him, But, lacking arms, I durst not. 2d serv. So would I. 1st serv. Give us some stout companions and good weapons, And, scatt'ring different ways, we'll scour the wood, And seize him shortly. Car. In the wood ye found him? 2d serv. Yes; as we went, out-stripping our companions, To bear Don Juan's body to the castle. Car. How guess you 'tis the murderer? 1st serv. A youthful cavalier for several days Has been secreted in the wood. I've seen him; And the dark form that cross'd my light e'en now I could be sworn is he. Diego. It is not likely that the murderer Should be so near the slain. He would, methinks, Run from the spot forthwith. Car. True, ne'ertheless A mind distracted in a wood so tangled Might run and make no way. (To servants.) Go ye forth: I will myself assist your search. But, first, We'll fetch our weapons. Ha! what noise is that? [Noise without. 'Tis voices at the gate. 1st serv. It is the body. (Voice calling from the outer court.) Ho, there! Who watch within? Lend us your aid, We know not where to bear it. Omnes. It is the body. [Exeunt, running eagerly through the gateway. Enter Mencia below, who has appeared before listening in the corridor. Men. He will be found and seiz'd: they'll have no mercy. The dreadful doom! O heaven, have pity on him! Enter Inez. Inez. What is the matter, madam? Whither go you? Men. I cannot tell. Inez. Go in, I do beseech you, And stay in your apartment. I, mean time, Will be upon the watch, and bring you word When they return. Think you that there has been, For I have listen'd too, a cavalier Secreted in the wood? Men. No; heed me not; I know not what I say. Inez. Yet stay not here, lest you should raise suspicion; Return to your apartment; be entreated. [Exeunt, Inez leading off Mencia. SCENE IV. Enter Leonora and Carlos by opposite sides. Car. Madam, I have obey'd your summons; say Whate'er my humble service may perform. How fare you after this most dismal shock? Leo. As one who hath a friend and husband both In one dire tempest lost. And, noble Carlos, Grief triumphs over pride, when even to thee, Though knowing well thy friendly worth, I own it. He wasâI mean HenriquezâOh! he was To me most strangely alter'd ere this stroke. Car. You are deceived; expecting to retain The undiminish'd empire of his heart Beyond the usual term of bridegroom weakness. It could not be. Leo. No; I am not deceived. Sickness did yesterday for many hours Confine him to his chamber; yet in vain Did I entreat admittanceâI, who used To soothe his saddest hours, if any sad Could pass when I was near him.â And now again he is shut up alone, And has refused to see me. Worthy Carlos, Do me a kindness: go thou to his door, And beg admittance; then in my behalf, Since by another's influence I must move him, Crave audience even for a few short moments. Car. Nay, charming Leonora, urge him not: He will admit thee when he is disposed For soothing sympathy; to press it sooner Were uselessâwere unwise. Leo. Yet go to him; he will, perhaps, to thee, So long his fellow-soldier and his friend, Unburthen his sad heart. Car. You are in this deceived. His fellow-soldier I long have been. In the same fields we've fought; Slept in one tent, or on the rugged heath, Wrapt in our soldier's cloaks, have, side by side, Stretch'd out our weary length like savage beasts In the same cheerless lair; and many a time, When the dim twilight of our evening camp Has by my foolish minstrelsy been cheer'd, He has bent o'er me, pleased with the old strains That pleased him when a boy; therefore I may, As common phrase permits, be call'd his friend. But there existed one, and only one, To whom his mind, with all its nice reserve Above the sympathies of common men, He freely could unfold; and having lost him, Can I intrude upon his private thoughts Like one who would supply a vacant place? His heart, I know it well, would from such boldness Revolt, even with disgust. Leo. Yet Juan's death did seem to move him less Than such dear friendship might have warranted. Car. It was his custom to restrain his looks When strongly moved, or shun all observation. Leo. And I am now become that humble thing,â A wife shut out from equal confidence! Car. Have patience, madam, take it not so deeply. Leo. I would have patience,â Car. Hush! we're interrupted. Enter Blas. Blas (to Leonora). Don Juan's secretary is arrived, Who brings with himâso has he bid me sayâ Papers of great importance, which he begs May, and without delay, to Don Henriquez, In presence of due witnesses, be read. Leo. It is a happy thing; this call will rouse him; Be thou the bearer of this message, Carlos; He cannot think thee an intruder now. Car. I will obey you. Leo. And be sure immediately To give me notice how he has received it. Car. I will not fail. [Exeunt severally. SCENE V. A spacious apartment. Enter Balthazar, followed by Blas, carrying a case with papers, which he lays on a table. Bal. (after examining it). Is Don Henriquez ready, gentle youth? Blas. He'll soon be here; the lady is at hand, With others, who will witness what you read. Bal. I'm glad she comes to soothe his gloomy grief, For I have that to read will move him greatly. Blas. I doubt it not: Don Juan loved him well, As it was thought. Bal. Sayst thou, as it was thought! I've often seen them spend whole days together, Neglecting all the sports of hall or field, In some sequester'd corner, side by side, Pacing, though young, with the slow steps of age, Each like the other's shadow; while, by turns, Such power of words flow'd from them, and their eyes With pleasure or with gentle anger flush'd, As the keen wilful sporting of their minds Through some wild chace of thought pursued the game. I mark'd them oft: it was a pleasing sight. Blas. Were they, indeed, such dear and loving friends? Bal. Yes, gentle youth, they were. It seem'd, in truth, As though each kept his thoughts i' th' other's breast, Lock'd up e'en from himself, having when met, And only then, free use of his own treasure. Blas. So closely knit? Bal. Yes; I have seen Henriquez By Juan's sick-bed sit, night after night, Like tenderest nurse watching her infant charge; And then I've seen the tears course down his cheeks,â His youthful face all shrunk and pale with grief. Such dear and manly friendship knew I never. Enter Leonora and Carlos, followed by Diego, who then retires with Blas to the bottom of the stage. Leo. (after a pause). I think I hear him coming. Car. I think so too; yet grief is slow of foot, And those are rapid strides like one in haste. Enter Henriquez, who returns slight and sullen acknowledgments to their civilities, and going directly to a seat prepared for him, sits down without speaking. Bal. (to Henriquez, after a pause). My lord, here is a will, with other papers, Which your deceased friend, my noble master, Committed to my keeping six days since, When he departed from his native home. His ancient fav'rite hound howl'd piteously As from the gate we prick'd our steeds, and yet We took no heed of it, nor thought, alas! That he would ne'er return.âPlease you, my lord, That it should first be read? Hen. Proceed; I'll listen. Bal. From the great love, above all men besides, Which living he did bear youâ Hen. Nay, proceed; There needs no prologue to it. Bal. (reading). âThe last will of me, Juan de Torva, written and signed by mine own hand, as these characters testify, is this. I bequeath to my beloved, my early, my only friend, Don Henriquez d'Altavera, the whole of my lands, my castles, my dependencies, my treasures, to be possessed by him and his heirs for ever; and for as much as I have more confidence in the wisdom and generous propriety of his judgment than my own, I leave those whose names (also by mine own hand) are herein written, to be provided for, as he, thinking and acting for me when I shall no longer be able to think and act for myself, shall deem right. These, with the last love and blessing of my heart I bequeath to him; desiring that my poor earthly remains may be laid in the same spot where he himself shall be interred. May God have mercy on the soul of a humble sinner! Done with mine own signature. âJuan De Torva.â Here follow names of many old dependants, And witnesses who saw him sign this deed; Shall I repeat them? Hen. (motions him to forbcar, and after covering his face with his hands for a moment or two). You also spoke, I think, of other papers: The date of this is, as I guess, remote. Bal. Nay, it is recentâonly two months since. Hen. So late as that!âYou mention'd other deeds. Bal. Yes, good my lord; entrusted to my keeping, Here is besides a marriage contract made Between himself and the fair Mencia. Hen. (starting from his chair with violent gesture). What didst thou say? The sister of my wife? Say it again: I know not what thou saidst. Bal. It is, my lord, a marriage contract made Between himself and Donna Mencia, The sister of your wife; to whom by stealth, The lady being somewhat disinclined, He has of late made frequent visits; hoping Last night, with her consent, to have surprised you, When as a masquer he should join the guests, By asking from your love a brother's blessing. [Henriquez falls back into his chair, uttering a deep groan. Leo. (rushing to him in great alarm). Alas! so strong an agony is here, The hand of death is on him. Car. 'Tis but the pitch and crisis of his grief: Be not alarm'd; he will recover quickly. [Diego, coming forward, speaks aside to Leonora. Diego. Bid all withdraw, and be with him alone When he recovers. Leo. (aside). How when he recovers? Alone with him! I know not what thou meanst. Diego (speaking to her aloud). My lord has from his youth been thus affected, When press'd by grief; I've seen him so before. And when the fit goes off, I've known him also Utter wild ravings. Solitude and stillness Are necessary. Pardon me this boldness. Leo. Thou'st seen him thus before? Diego. It is a patural infirmity; Let all retire and leave him. Leo. (motions all to retire but Carlos). Don Carlos will remain. [To Diego. Diego. None but yourself, I do beseech you, madam; And I will watch by you till he recover. [Exeunt all but Diego, Leonora, and Henriquez, who, while she hangs over him, groans as before. Leo. That groan again! My dearâmy dear Henriquez! Alas! that look! thine agony is great: That motion too! (He rises.) Why dost thou stare around? We are alone; surely thou wilt not leave me. Where wouldst thou be? Hen. I' the blackest gulf of hell; The deepest den of misery and pain; Woe bound to woeâthe cursed with the cursed! Leo. What horrible words, if they have any meaning! If they have none, most piteous!â Henriquez; O, my lord!âMy noble husband! I thought not thou wouldst e'er have look'd on me As thou hast done, with such an eye of sternness. Alas! and hadst thou nothing dear on earth But him whom thou hast lost? Hen. I had, I had! Thy love was true and virtuous. And so it is: thy hand upon my breast. [Pressing her hand, which she has laid upon his breast. I feel itâO how dear! [Is about to kiss it, but casts it from him. It must not be! Would thou wert false! Would grinding contumely Had bow'd me to the earthâworn from my mind The very sense and nature of a man! Faithful to me! Go, loose thee from my side; Thy faithfulness is agony ineffable, It makes me more accursed. Cling not to me: To taste the slightest feeling of thy love Were baseâwere monstrous now.âFollow me not! The ecstasy of misery spurns all pity. [Exit. Diego. And do not follow him: O do not, madam! This fearful fit will soon exhaust its strength, And leave his reason free. Leo. God grant it may! It is a fearful fit. But thou thyself lookst strangely, and thy visage Seems haggard with a passing consciousnessâ Thou dost not thinkâ Diego. No, no! what should I think? Retire to your apartment: I meantime Will watch my lord, that none may cross his way Till he be safely lodged within his chamber. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. A narrow hall or passage. Enter Carlos and Balthazar. Car. (calling to somebody behind him as he enters). Go, bid those spearmen from the armourer Receive their pageant suits, and let the warder Hang o'er the battlements his sable flag! Bal. And will not Don Henriquez, then, in person Attend the funeral rites? Car. His ancient steward Has signified to me his lord's desire That I should fill his place in every thing Respecting this sad ceremony. Bal. Have you not seen himself? Car. No; grief so stern, so cover'd and profound, I never knew: he has refused to see me. Bal. They say his ghostly father hath been summon'd: He'll try to soften his untoward grief. Car. I hope he will; but pass we on, I pray. Bal. The murd'rer has, I hear, escaped their search. Car. He did escape, if it was any thing, Those frighten'd peasants saw. Bal. In truth it is a black, mysterious deed; And, as it strikes my mindâ Car. Some other time: Pass on, I pray, our business must proceed. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. The grand court of the castle. Enter a pompous funeral procession by an arched way at the right side of the bottom of the stage, and crossing it in a diagonal line, passes out by the left side of the front; which joins the massed richness of a perspective to the distinctness of a side view. SCENE II. A small private apartment. Enter Leonora, walking thoughtfully across the stage; then enter Diego, upon which she turns, and goes up to him, without speaking. Diego (after pausing for her to speak first). They told me, madam, you desired to see me. Leo. Yes, good Diego, I would speak with thee; Yet what I have to say comes of no sense,â Mere curiosity,âa woman's humour. Looking from my apartment not long since, Methought I saw thee in the inner court, Earnest in conversation with Balthazar. I mark'd you for a while, and his strange gestures Seem'd those of anger rather than of grief. Diego. He was, in truth, somewhat intemperate. Leo. What has disturb'd him? Diego. He is a man by nature cross and captious, And hardly to be satisfied. Leo. How so? Has aught been wanting in the funeral honours Paid to his master? Diego. No; it is not that. He rather thinks we have been more intent On idle pageantry, than truly zealous In finding out the murd'rer of his lord; 'Twas this did move him to unseemly warmth, And words which I may not repeat. Leo. (eagerly). What words? Does he suspectâNo; what should he suspect? [Pausing and gazing on Diego, who is silent. Thy face looks pale and haggard. Did he name him? Diego. Name whom? Leo. No, no one. This bewilder'd brain Will run on things too wildly fanciful. I'll speak to him myself; he shall be satisfied. Search shall be made without delay. Go to him, And tell him I would see him privately. Diego. He is not here. Leo. What! not within the walls? Diego. Mounted upon his master's swiftest steed, He left the castle short while since; ere this He must be near Zamora. Leo. Why such haste? Diego. I know not; 'tis, perhaps, to gain admission, Before the opening of his royal court, To the king's private ear. Leo. (alarmed). Most strange! some thoughtâ some dark imagination Has worked him to this frenzy.âTell me truly Where his suspicions rest: for he has spoken Words which thou wouldst conceal. Spoke he in hints? O tell me all!âHe did not name Henriquez? Diego. No; by the noble house of Altavera, Had he so done that word had been his last. Diego Furnez, aged as he is, Had ne'er stood by with rapier by his side To hear his master's honour rudely stain'd With horrid imputation. Leo. Hush! speak low. I meant not that! a thing too wild and frightful Even for a hasty thought.âBut does he know A lurking stranger in the wood was found, With scared and hasty fear, confessing guilt? [Mencia, entering behind them, and listening to the last words, rushes forward in grcat alarm. Men. Confessing guilt! O trust not his confession! Believe not what he says! a frenzied dream! For mercy's sake, my sister! O, for mercy! Leo. Mencia; what sudden madness seizes thee? Mercy! for whom dost thou implore my mercy? Men. Cruel thou art to ask! My first, my dearest: O had no other ever look'd upon me, This misery had not been. Leo. It is Antonio, then, for whom thou fearest? Is he the stranger who escaped their search? Men. Has he escaped? Then heaven be praised he has! Leo. And thou didst know that he was lurking here? Men. Catch not so eagerly my foolish words; I think of him when any youth is mention'd. Diego. Lady, we only said, âa lurking stranger:â It is yourself who marks him as a youth. Men. I know not what I say;âI'm most unhappy: I will retire. Leo. Yes; thou hadst best retire; And be appeased; Antonio is not found, Though now we know on whom to fix the charge. [Exit Mencia. (Gladly to Diego.) Now it is clear: it is a blest relief! My good Diego, faithful, kind, old friend; Even for the love which thou dost bear thy lord, I call thee friend;âit is a blest relief. (Taking his hand.) It comes upon my heart,âa loaded heart, That was with horror press'd, and brings these tears. Diego. God bless you, lady! Had I sooner known The steady truth and kindness of your nature, It had been well, for I have been perverse; But henceforth I will curb all wayward thoughts, And honour you as Don Henriquez' wife, And worthy so to be. Leo. Cease, friend; all thy perverseness is forgotten. Enter Carlos. In a good time thou com'st, my noble friend. Car. How's this? Strange joy has lighten'd up your eyes, Unsuited to these hours of sable sadness. Leo. We have discover'd Juan's murderer. Car. I'm glad to hear it: have you certain proof? Leo. Antonio, Mencia's lover; a wild youth, Whose most presumptuous love, not long ago, She had for Juan's nobler suit rejected, Is the mysterious stranger, here, by night, Found lurking in the wood, whose hasty flight So well betrayed his guilt. Car. I will, and instantly, Despatch a swift pursuit, to trace his flight. I've seen the youth, and can describe his mien, And slender, graceful form. O most unlike One who could do a fell and bloody deed! Leo. A gentle form the fellest heart may shroud. Diego. I have known such to anger and to blood More prone than sterner men. Car. You seem offended with me, but I meant not To question what you say. The time is precious: I'll send, without delay, on every track, Those who, I trust, will shortly seize upon him. Guilty or innocent. I came to say Those maids and holy men, as you appointed, Are in the chapel met, and wait your presence, To sing a nightly requiem for the dead, Who, in the vault beneath, his first still night Of the grave's rest doth pass. But we'll postpone these rites till we have done What must not be delayed. Leo. Ay; let us lose no time. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The burying vault of the castle, with monuments of the dead; and near the front of the stage, a newly covered grave, seen by the light of a lamp placed on a neighbouring tomb, the stage being otherwise dark. A solemn requiem for the dead is heard at a distance, sounding from above. As it draws to a close, Henriquez appears at the further end of the vault with a light in his hand, which he holds out from him, as if in search of some object, and, seeing the grave, casts the light from his hand, and rushes towards it Hen. (after gazing some time on the grave). And here thou liest with all thy noble parts, Thy lofty, liberal soul, and goodly form, And heart of love so thorough and so true! This is thy rest, the meed and recompense Thy generous worth hath from thy friend received! Thy friend! O savage heart and cruel hand! Fell, hateful, faithless, cowardly, and base! Of every baleful thing, by heaven cast off, Most cursed and miserable!â O that ere this the dust had cover'd me Like a crush'd snake, whose sting is yet unsheath'd! Would in the bloody trench some sabred Moor Had lanced this hold of lifeâthis latent seat Of cruelty! or rather that some dart, Shot erring in our days of boyish sport, Had pierced its core! Then by my early grave He had shed over me a brother's tears; He had sate there and wept and mourn'd for me, When from all human hearts but his alone All thoughts of me had been extinguished. Juan! My Juan, dear, dear friend! Juan de Torva! Thy name is on my lips, as it was wont; Thine image in my heart like stirring life; Thy form upon my fancy like that form Which bless'd my happy days. How he would look, When with his outspread arms, as he return'd After some absence!âOh, it tortures me! Let any image cross my mind but this! No, no! not this!âSable, sepulchral gloom! Embody to my sight some terrible thing, And I will brave it. (Pausing and looking round.) It doth! it doth! there's form and motion in it. Advance, thou awful shade, whate'er thou art! Those threat'ning gestures say thou art not Juan. [Rubbing his eyes. It was but fancy.âNo; the soul to Him Who is the Soul of souls ascended hath, Dust to its dust return'd. There is nought here But silent rest that can be rous'd no more. Beneath this mould, some few spans deep he lies. So near me, though conceal'd!âCurs'd as I am, The cords of love e'en through this earth have power, Like a strong charm, to draw me to him still. [Casting himself upon the grave. Burst, guilty heart! rend every nerve of life, And be resolved to senseless clay like this, So to enlap his dearer clay for ever. Enter Carlos. Car. (looking round him). He is not here: nought see I through the gloom Save the cold marble of those tombs which, touch'd With the wan light of yon sepulchral lamp, Show their scroll'd ends to the uncertain sight, Like shrouded bodies rising from the earth. [Going towards the grave. Ha! something stirring on the new raised earth! It is Henriquez, wrapped in frantic sorrow. [Advancing to him. Henriquez! hearst thou not, noble Henriquez? Nay, nay! rise from the earth: such frantic grief Doth not become a man, and least of all A man whose firm endurance of misfortune Has hitherto so graced his noble worth. Giv'st thou no answer but these heavy groans? Thou canst not from the tomb recall the dead, But rouse thy spirit to revenge his death. Hen. (raising his head). What saidst thou? Car. Quit this dismal bed of death, And rouse thee to revenge thy murder'd friend. Hen. He is revenged; heav'n deals with guilt so monstrous: The hand of man is nothing. Car. Ay, but the hand of man shall add its mite. [Taking hold of his hand to raise him. Up from the earth! I've found the murderer. Hen. (springing up fiercely, and seizing him by the throat). Layst thou thy hand on me? What is or is not, The God of heaven doth know, and He alone. Darest thou with mortal breath bestow that name, To the dishonour of a noble house, On one of ancient princely lineage born? Car. Let go thy frenzied grasp! Should brave Castilians Thus grapple hand to hand, like angry boys? Fit time and place shall justify my words, If they indeed offend.âOur watch hath seiz'd In hiding near the castle, most suspiciously, A youth who hath to Mencia's love pretended, Whose hand, we cannot doubt, hath done the deed; But if he be of such high lineage born, 'Tis more than he hath claim'd or we will credit. Why drop your arms thus listless by your side; Your eyes upon the ground? Will you not go And see the prisoner, and hear him question'd? Hen. Ay, ay, this is required: I'll go with thee; I comprehend thee now. Car. And yet thou mov'st not: Does any sudden pain arrest thy steps? Hen. I am benumb'd and faint.âI'll follow thee. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. A prison in the castle. Antonio discovered disconsolate near the front of the stage. A high door at the bottom, with stairs from it, leading down into the prison. Ant. (after shifting his posture several times, and sighing heavily, raises his eyes on hearing the door open gently). Another visit! do they vainly think, By oft-repeated questions, to betray A spent, enfeebled mind into confession? It is a woman! it is Mencia's self! Enter Mencia, descending the steps into the prison. And comest thou to visit me, to bless My dismal prison-house with what were bliss E'en in the lowest state of human misery? Sweet Mencia! thou hast pity on me then. Pity embedded lies where love hath been, And love again doth from that pity spring, As the dropp'd seed of some fair faded flower Shoots its sheath'd bud from the cleft mould, first peeping In timid beauty, after April showers, Then swelling, bursting, spreading its soft leaves To the free air, more fragrant than before. Yes, I am happy, gentle Mencia, In spite of fate, if thou still carest for me. Men. This is no time for words like these. I dread E'en but to look upon thee, wretched man! Take this disguise; it will ensure escape. There is a faithful friend who waits without, And by the postern will direct thy flight. Speak not, but throw these weeds about thee quickly; The time is precious. [Holding out garments which she bears over her arm. Ant. Thou dreadst to look upon me, yet thou comest To save my lifeâto save a murderer's life? Men. I said not so in pity of thy state; That bloody deed I know hath been the act Of frenzied passion: in some foreign land Live and repent: Heaven grant thee grace for this! Let not man's hand, the brand of public shame, Be on thy wretched head! Ant. The hand of man, the brand of public shame, Falls on the guilty head, by heaven's appointment. Thou riskest the salvation of thy soul In aiding my escape; and for my life, If of thy love bereft, I care not whether The headsman's axe, or the slow hand of nature, Shall rid me of it. Nay; the first were best. Men. O no! upon my knees I do conjure thee. [Attempting to kneel, but prevented by him. If I offend in this, heav'n will forgive me: For, oh! if thou art lost, I am most wretched. My misery or peace hangs on thy life; Therefore, upon my bended knees, I beg. [Sinking from his hold to the ground. 'Tis for myself I plead; fly instantly. Ant. (raising her). Ah dear, dear Mencia! And car'st thou thus, For a foul criminal,âa man of blood? What, then, had been thy careâmay I not sayâ What, then, had been thy loveâhad he been innocent? Men. Alas, alas! hadst thou been innocent, I had defied the world, with all its lures, Again to sever us. Yet, as thou artâ Ant. Misfortune, thanks! Thou hast done more for me Than the devoted care of many years. Come, then, defy the world to sever us, My generous Mencia; I am innocent. Men. Ha! dost thou say it? Saidst thou innocent? And sayst thou truly so? Hast thou not done it? Is it no mockery of joy? O no! That look, that smile! Yes, thou art innocent; And, heaven be praised, thou art! Ant. I am, indeed, of Juan's death most innocent. And though some circumstances do at present Accuse me strongly, yet, I trust in heaven, That on my trial so it will appear. Men. Nay; do not trust. O no! for Don Henriquez, Made savage by despair, will have a victim, And catch with eagerness at every proof, How slight soe'er it be. Fly; quickly fly, And I will follow thee and share thy fortune Or be it good or ill. Ant. O blessed words! my dear, my gen'rous love! My heart throbs at the thought, but cannot thank thee. And thou wilt follow me and share my fortune, Or good or ill! Ah! what of good can with a skulking outlaw In his far wand'rings, or his secret haunts, E'er be? O no! thou shalt not follow me. Men. Good may be found for faithful, virtuous love, In every spot; and for the wand'ring outlaw, The very sweetest nooks o' the earth are his. And be his passing home the goatherd's shed, The woodman's branchy hut, or fisher's cove, Whose pebbly threshold by the rippling tide Is softly washed, he may contented live, Ay, thankfully; fed like the fowls of heaven With daily food sent by a Father's hand. Ant. (pressing both her hands to his heart, and then kissing them). Thanks, gentle, virtuous Mencia; but, alas! Far different is the hapless outlaw's home From what thy gentle fancy fashioneth. With lawless men he must protection find. Some murky cavern where the light of day Hath never peer'dâwhere the pitch'd brand, instead, Sheds its red glare on the wild revelry Of fierce banditti; or the pirate's bark, Where stalks the sabred ruffian o'er the deck, Watching his distant preyâsome home-bound ship, With all its stores and freight of precious souls, Who ne'er shall greet their native shores again, Must be his guilty home. Men. Alas, alas! Ant. Thou shalt not follow me, nor will I fly. Sever'd from thee I will not live, sweet love, Nor shalt thou be the mate of one disgraced, And by the good disown'd. Here I'll remain, And heav'n will work for me a fair deliv'rance. Men. No, no! the present means for thy escape Are sent to thee by heav'n. Be not so stubborn! With or without me fly, even as thou wilt, But do not linger here. [Looking to the door on hearing it moce. The doorâO misery! we are surprised. It is Henriquez; Heaven have pity on us! Enter Henriquez, while Mencia shrinks behind Antonio. Hen. (advancing). Ha! not alone! Who is it? Wretched Mencia! Men. (rushing forward). Oh he is innocent! Have pity on us! Turn not away from me, noble Henriquez. [Catching hold of him eagerly. Heaven knows that he is innocent. Hen. Then, pray thee, be at peace; heav'n will protect him. Men. Frown not; my wretchedness has made me bold. Hen. Away, away! I do not frown on thee. Thou art the baleful cause of all this misery, And yet I blame thee not. Away, and leave us! Ant. Retire, dear Mencia; to thy chamber go; It is not fit that thou shouldst tarry here. [She retires unwillingly; Henriquez waving his hand to quicken her retreat, and waiting in gloomy silence till she is gone. Hen. Unhappy youth; thou hast to thine accusers Thine innocence asserted with the earnest And simple manliness of truth; yet truth, Supported only by the word of him Who is accused, will nought avail. How is it? If there be any circumstance that may Support or prove thy words, I do entreat thee To tell me freely, and I will, with speed, Use every means that may unfold it fully To aid thy exculpation. (Pauses.) Is there none? Bethink thee well: how slight soe'er it be, It may to others lead of more import. Ant. Thanks, generous man! Hen. Nay, nay! What is thine answer? Ant. Alas! four days within that fatal wood I have been hid; unseen of every one But Mencia, and those hinds who did pursue me. What circumstance can then avail me? No; Heaven, in its justice, will unfold the truth; In this I put my trust; proofs I have none. Hen. Take the deliv'rance, then, which heaven has sent thee. Fly, save thy life. (Offering a purse.) This will procure the means, When thou hast clear'd the precincts of the forest. All now is still, and favours thy escape. Ant. My lord, like one stunn'd with astonishment, I thank your gen'rous care. But, Don Henriquez, Though born of blood less noble than your own, An outlaw's fate, from friends and country banish'd, My honest fame blurr'd with imputed guilt, Is not deliv'rance such as I accept, Such as a true Castilian can accept. You offer it in pity of my youth, Therefore I thank you; but I'll here abide Such vindication as becomes mine honour. Hen. But should it fail thee, canst thou better brook A malefactor's death, the public gaze, The scaffold's open shame, the executioner, All the degrading ministry of death; Even that which so attainteth noble blood That ages wear not out th' abhorred blot, Disgracing all thy line? Ay, think of this: It makes me shudder as I utter it, Who have in battle faced all dreadful things. Ant. In truth, it makes your strengthen'd features wear A ghastly hue of horror. How is this, That such strong sympathy should move you so? You think me guiltless in the very front Of proof that should condemn me: then, belike, Some shrewd suspicion of the actual hand That did th' accursed deed lurks in your mind. Hen. Ha! Cast an accusation on mine honour! Ant. No, Don Henriquez; with a friendly wish To do me service cam'st thou here, and sacred Is all that thou in privacy hast done Or utter'd. Yea; though thou shouldst now confess That thou thyself wert Juan's murderer (Start not, these are but words of argument); Yea, e'en supposing this, and that my rescue From the uplifted axe depended on it, Yet would I not betray thee. Hen. (turning away haughtily). Thou art incorrigible: take thy will. [Returning and laying down a key. I leave thee this; thou wilt consider of it. Say, is there aught that thou wouldst have me do? Ant. Send me a priest. Though only such transgressions As youthful folly prompts rest on my mind, Yet would my soul, shrived by some holy man, His ghostly counsel take, and be at peace. Hen. And be at peace! Ay, ghostly counsel may To such as thou give peace. O could it alsoâ I know an aged friar, wise and prudent: Thou shalt be satisfied. [Exit. Ant. (after following him with his eye as he ascends the stair at the bottom of the stage). But that it were so horrid and unnatural, A thing at strife with all consistent thoughts, I could believeâNo; 'tis impossible. [Retires to the bottom of the stage, and the scene closes. SCENE II. An antechamber. Enter Carlos and Friar by opposite sides. Car. Good morning, father! you are early here. Whom come you to confess? Friar. I have already been with the poor prisoner. Car. And thou hast heard, no doubt, the horrid truth Which he denies to every one besides? Friar. I've heard all he confesses. Car. Ay; what strange tales, what secret horrid things, In thy long course of ghostly ministry, Have in thine ear been pour'd! By this good hand, But that I did prefer the jointed mail And weapon's stroke to haircloth and the scourge, The roar of battle to the chaunting choir, I had become a friar, to learn, like thee, All those dark mysteries of human nature, To which thy mind is conscious. Friar. Gentle son! Pardon my words; thou talkst in ignorance. A tale of guilt, wrung from the sinner's soul, Strikes not the fancy like a winter's tale Of moonlight witchery, or murder done I' th' secret chamber. No; a counter sympathy Doth quell the fancy then. Thou speakst in ignorance. Car. True, father, this may be. With your permission I will attend you to the gate. Friar. Not now. I'm summon'd: Don Henriquez waits for me. Car. At the confessional? Friar. So I believe; I meet him in the chapel. Car. I am right glad of this. We marvell'd much He did not sooner think of ghostly comfort. Friar. I have been summon'd by him once before; But when I came, capricious in his sorrow, He would not see me. Car. Speak comfort to him, and enjoin some penance For the indulgence of such frantic grief; So wayward, so excessive. May God bless thee! [Exit friar. Here comes our keen and fiery secretary. Enter Balthazar. Return'd so soon! And hath the royal ear Inclin'd to thy petition? Bal. Ay; every cot and castle in the realm At my command must open gate and hold, Chamber and bower; e'en the sepulchral vault, Whose sable scutcheon'd door hath not for years Upon its hinges jarr'd, must be unlock'd, And show its secrets to the searching light. But as I learn you have secured the murderer, I am content; here ends my brief commission. I pray you lead me to the prison-house: I burn to see the wretch. Car. Come, follow me [Exeunt. SCENE III. A chapel. Henriquez discorered on his knees by the confessional, the Friar bending over him, and muttering words in a low voice. Friar (aloud). Rise, son, in humble but assured faith! Repentance, and these penances endured, Will gain from heavenly grance full absolution Of this most guilty deedâof all thy sins. Rise, and be comforted! [Raising him, and leading him forward. Be comforted! The worst of sinners league not with despair, But by their own untoward disbelief, The greatest sin of all. Thou smit'st thy breast, And shak'st thy drooping head: thou must not doubt. All sin is finite, mercy infinite; Why shouldst thou doubt that God will pardon thee? Hen. I doubt it not. God's mercy pardons all Who truly do repent; and O how truly, How deeply, how intensely I repent! But in my breast there is a goading sense, An inward agony, a power repelling In dire abhorrence every better thought. The bliss of heaven for me! incongruous hope! My soul, my fancy, yea my very will Is link'd to misery; and happiness Comes to my thoughts like gleams of painful day To owls and bats, and things obscene and hateful, Fitted by nature for their dismal dens. O that I were like such! in the reft rock Of some dank mine coil'd up, dull and unconscious Of the loud hammer's sound, whose coming stroke Should crush me from existence! Friar. Alas, alas, my son, have better thoughts. Hen. Let them arise in better hearts, for mine A nest of stinged scorpions hath become, And only fit for such. Each recollection, Each waking fancy, like a barbed fang, Pierces its core with thrilling agony, Which yields to a succeeding, sharper sting, And that again to others keener still. So kind, so dear, such manly, true affection! Friendship so pure! such noble confidence! Love that surmounted all things! When, in passion, I did an outrage on his fiery blood, What would have hurl'd on any other head The instant stroke of deathâhe only waitedâ Friar. Give o'er, my son; thou art too vehement. Hen. He waited till my senseless rage was spent, Then smil'dâO such a sweet, upbraiding smile! Open'd his arms, and clasp'd me to his heart. That smile, those open'd arms, I see them now,â I see them constantly; where'er I turn, They front me like a vision of delight Changed to a gorgon terror. Yet no restraining love did plead for him: As though he had some common rev'ller been, All base suggestions were received against him, Were cherish'd, brooded on by dint of thought, Work'd to a semblance of consistent truth, Which, but for this, hateful ingratitude, All other crimes surpassing, ne'er had found Credence so wild. Iron heart and ruffian hand! Ye took your cursed will, and slew the noblest, The bravest, and the best, like a vile traitor! [Beating his forchead and striding away. Friar. My son, this is wild ecstasy of passion, Which leads not to that humble true repentance Our holy church enjoins. Hen. (returning). Or had I met him as an open foe, With accusation of defiance fairly Preceding vengeance; but unheard, i' th' dark! Tremble, ye venerable roofs, ye towers Of my brave fathers, men without reproach; Fall on my cursed head, and grind to dust What bears the honour'd semblance of their son, Although unmeet to bear the human form. Friar. Nay, nay! I pray forbear; this violent grief For thy soul's weal is most unprofitable. Betake thyself betimes to prayer and penance. The sufferings of the body will relieve The suff'rings of the mind. Hen. The sufferings of the body! They are powerless. [Showing his hand. See here, short while, in agony of thought, Pacing the armoury where hangs the mail Which Juan wore, when in Tolosa's field We fought the turban'd Moslems side by side; It was his gift, which I did beg of him, In the proud joy I felt at his high deeds. How swell'd my heart! A braver knight in arms Fought not that day. Bold heart and potent hand, And lofty mien and eyes that flash'd with valour! Where run my words? I have forgot their drift. Friar. Something which happen'd in the armoury. Hen. Ay, in the armoury, as I have said, I struck my hand, in vehemence of action, On a spik'd shield, nor knew till afterwards, When the wild fit was past, and oozing blood Loaded my clammy touch, that in my flesh The broken iron was sheath'd. No; what can corporeal pain or penance do? That which inflicts the mental wound, which rends The hold of pride, wrenching the bent of nature; 'Tis that alone hath power. Yet from the effort Nature starts back; my mind, stunn'd at the thought, Loses the use of thought. Friar. I do not understand you, good my lord. Hen. It matters not; you will, perhaps, hereafter. Friar. You are at present feeble and exhausted, And lack repose; retire awhile, my son. Hark! on the walls without, do you not hear The warder's call to note the rising morn? Hen. The morn! And what have I to do with morn? The redd'ning sky, the smoking camp, the stir Of tented sleepers rousing to the call, The snorting steed, in harness newly dight, Did please my fancy once. Ay; and the sweetness Of my still native woods, when, through the mist, They show'd at early dawn their stately oaks, Whose dark'ning forms did gradually appear Like slow approaching friends, known doubtfully. These pleased me once in better days; but now My very soul within me is abhorrent Of every pleasant thing; and that which cheers The stirring soldier or the waking hind, That which the traveller blesses, and the child Greets with a shout of joy, as from the door Of his pent cot he issues to the air, Does but increase my misery.â I loathe the light of heaven: let the night, The hideous unbless'd night, close o'er me now, And close for ever! Friar. Cease, cease! and cherish not such dark despair. Retire to your apartment, and in prayer Beseech Almighty Goodness to have pity On a perturbed soul. Hen. Pray thou for me; I will pray when I can. Friar. Hark! steps along the corridor; they come To say an early mass for the repose Of the interr'd: they must not find you here. Hen. And to the dead they give repose! What mass, What prayers, what chaunted hymns can to the living Give respite from this agony of soul? Alas, alas! there is no cure for this. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A small court before the door of the prison, which is open. Blas and other domestics discovered waiting near it. 1dom. (to Blas). Goes Don Henriquez with the prisoner? Blas. He does; his noble courser at the gate, Black Sultan, saddled stands, champing the bit, And casting from his mouth the flaky foam. Stand back; they're coming now. Enter Antonio, Carlos, Friar, Balthazar, and Diego, from the prison. Friar (to Antonio). Be not cast down, my son, but trust in heaven! Ant. And so I do; that is my stay, good father; And yet, methinks, these fetters might be spared. By Don Henriquez' orders am I thus Like a vile felon chain'd? Car. 'Tis by his orders; 'tis a stated form. I fear they gall you; are they clench'd too tightly? Bal. Who doth a felon's deeds must e'en submit To bear a felon's manacles. Ant. (to Baltiiazar). Yes; man of pens, and records, and old lore, Such is thy narrow and ungen'rous nature. [Turning to Carlos. This rough but noble soldier, bred in camps And midst the broil of battle, is more gentle. Henriquez seem'd inclined to pity me, To think me innocent; then, wherefore these? Car. Come, we lose time, we must begin our journey To reach the town by close of day, Henriquez Being intent to gain a royal audience Before the sitting of to-morrow's court. [Exeunt all but Diego, to whom enters Leonora, with something in her hand. Leo. My good Diego, hie thee to the gate; And ere thy master mount, give him this scarf, These gloves too, and his signet, which, in haste, He left behind. [Giving them to him. He has forbidden me to follow him, And he must be obeyed. Diego. He shall receive them. Leo. How look'd Antonio when they led him forth? Greatly dejected? Diego. No; he bears it stoutly. Leo. Asserting still that he is innocent? Diego. Ay, ay; but every villain does the same. Does not my lord believe that he is guilty? Leo. I cannot doubt it. When he left the chapel A long time in his chamber he remain'd; When he came forth again, I watch'd his eye, And it was calm, though gloomy. Then forthwith He gave his orders that a band of spearmen Should be in readiness to guard the prisoner Bound to Zamora; and were he in doubt, He were not now so calm, being before So greatly agitated. Hie thee quickly. [Exeunt severally. ACT V. SCENE I. The court at Zamora, a grand hall of audience. Nobles, prelates, officers, &amp;c. discovered in waiting; a flourish of trumpets. Enter the King and his train, who walks slowly, as he receives their homage, to a chair of state near the front of the stage. 1noble (presenting a petition). May't please your highness, look on this petition, Humbly presented to your royal notice By one of noble blood. King. And noble conduct, too, I hope, Don Pedro. What is its plea? [After reading the paper slightly. That he beneath a lady's window hath A most audacious suitor slain, who there Did charm her ear with love-sick ditties.âSlew him! A harsh device to win the lady's favour; Had she not ears to be again enthrall'd? Another song had been a fitter weapon Of opposition than a sword, methinks. [Giving the paper to a secretary. Note down that I will look on this again. 2d noble (giving a paper). Deign, royal sir, to look upon this paper. King. Freely, Don Blas; from such a noble hand It needs must be an honourable suit. [Reading the paper. Don Julian, of the noble house of Guzman, Hath, by the cadet of a meaner house, Been elbow'd from his place, who most nefariously Refused to yield to him the dexter side. [Reading on more slightly. Honour repair'dâthat he be forcedâa blow! [Shaking his head. We are too learned in this ancient kingdom. Nay, reverend prelate, no offence to you; The clergy stand acquitted of this charge. Prelate. I know not how to comprehend your highness. King. We should be spared full many a deadly broil, Did we not know our right hand from our left. We are in this, good sooth! too nicely learn'd, Which doth but scantily, in my opinion, Supply the want of every other lore. 2d noble (aside to 1st). Never may I again i' th' royal presence Wear hat and plume, if this is not derision. 1noble (aside). 'Tis Don Henriquez we may thank for this. He spoke not to us thus when the arm'd Moor Was nearer to his doors. King (to prelate). And now, my lord, let me receive your paper. Prelate. Most humbly to your highness I present it, From pious men, whose prayers are offer'd up For your prosperity. [Gives the paper. King (reading it slightly). âThat the free hinds of Tormes and their wives Refuse their wonted offerings to the convent, And therefore humblyâthe adjoining landsâ A royal compensation.ââSo it runs, And it must cost me many a fruitful field, Because those villagers love fatted pullets, As well as sober, self-denying monks! This also at our leisure we'll consider. [Gives the paper to the secretary, and sitting down, receives other petitions, when a confused noise is heard. What noise is that without? Enter an Officer. Offi. May't please you, Don Henriquez waits without. King. Henriquez, my brave general? How is this? Offi. He comes attended by a goodly train, Guarding a prisoner, and humbly begs To be admitted to the royal presence, Before your court shall sit. King. Most willingly: say, I am ready now To give him audience. [Exit officer. I marvel much How it should be. In this unwonted form To bring his prisoner!âBut here he comes. Enter Henriquez, followed by Carlos and Antonio, going up to the King, who rises to meet him. King. Thou too, my valiant friend, a suitor here? Hen. A humble supplicant. King. Who needs not sue. Say freely what thou wouldst, and it is granted. Hen. But what I beg, an earnest boon, must be Confirm'd to me with all solemnity, Before I utter it. King. A strange request! But that thy services have been to me Beyond all recompense, and that I know Thy country's welfare and thy sovereign's honour Are dear to thee, as thou full well hast proved, I should with some precaution give my word. But be it so; I say thy suit is granted. Hen. Nay, swear it on this sword. King. Where doth this tend? Doubtst thou my royal word? Hen. When honour'd lately by your princely presence, You gave to me this ring with words of favour; And said if I should e'er, by fortune press'd, Return the same to you, whatever grace I then might ask, should be conceded to me. [Giving the ring. Receive your royal token: my request Is that you swear upon my sword to grant This boon which I shall beg. [Holds out his sword to the King, who lays his hand on it. King. This sword, this honour'd blade, I know it well, Which thou in battle from the princely Moor So valiantly didst win: why should I shrink From any oath that shall be sworn on this? I swear, by the firm honour of a soldier, To grant thy boon, whatever it may be. Declare it then, Henriquez. [A pause. Thou art pale And silent too: I wait upon thy words. Hen. My breath forsook me. 'Tis a passing weakness: I have power now. There is a criminal, Whose guilt before your highness in due form Shall shortly be attested; and my boon Is, that your highness will not pardon him However strongly you may be inclined To royal clemency,âhowever strongly Entreated so to do. King. This much amazes me. Ever till now, Thou'st been inclined to mercy, not to blood. Hen. Yea; but this criminal, with selfish cruelty, With black ingratitude, with base disloyalty To all that sacred is in virtuous ties, Knitting man's heart to manâWhat shall I say? I have no room to breathe. [Tearing open his doublet with violence. He had a friend, Ingenuous, faithful, generous, and noble: E'en but to look on him had been full warrant Against th' accusing tongue of man or angel, To all the world beside,âand yet he slew him. A friend whose fost'ring love had been the stay, The guide, the solace of his wayward youth,â Love steady, tried, unwearied,âyet he slew him. A friend, who in his best devoted thoughts, His happiness on earth, his bliss in heaven, Intwined his image, and could nought devise Of sep'rate good,âand yet he basely slew him; Rush'd on him like a ruffian in the dark, And thrust him forth from life, from light, from nature, Unwitting, unprepared for th' awful change Death brings to all. This act so foul, so damned, This he hath done: therefore upon his head Let fall the law's unmitigated justice. King. And wherefore doubtst thou that from such a man I will withhold all grace? Were he my brother I would not pardon him. Produce your criminal. [Those who have Antonio in custody lead him forward. Hen. (motioning with his hand to forbid them). Undo his shackles; he is innocent. King. What meaneth this? Produce your criminal. Hen. (kneeling). My royal master, he is at your feet. [A cry of astonishment is heard through the hall; the King, staggering back from the spot, is supported by an attendant, while Carlos and Antonio, now free from his fetters, run to Henriquez, who continues kneeling, and bend over him in deep concern. King (recovering). A fearful shock! Mine ears are ringing still. Rise, Don Henriquez d'Altavera, rise! (Turning away his head.) Raise him: O do not let me see him thus! [Motions the crowd to withdraw, who go off, leaving the King, Henriquez, Carlos, and Antonio only on the stage. King (fiercely). Carlos, on thee my anger rests, who thus Stoodst by and suffer'dst me to be deceived. Car. Condemn me not, my liege; I was myself, Convinced this youth had done the deed, deceived. This on a soldier's honour I aver. King. Alas, Henriquez! thou hast practised on me With cruel guile. I would right gladly forfeit The fairest town thy sword e'er won for me, And be again at liberty to pardon Whatever thou hast done: a deed, most surely, By thy high nature all too rudely charged. Thou in the frenzy of some headlong passion Hast acted as a madman, who still wreaks His direst wrath on those he loves the most. Hen. No, no! it was an act of brooding thought, Of slow intent, of dark consideration. Our early love, with all his fair endowments And noble qualities, before my mind Did clearly pass; pass and return again, And strongly plead for him, and were rejected. King. Go to! thou hast a wild imagination, Which has o'erreach'd thy judgment.âSet me free. The public weal requires thy service: oaths Adverse to this do not, and should not, bind. Hen. There are within your kingdom many chiefs Who may do better service to the state, Though not with better will than I have done; [Laying his sword at the King's feet. Here do I part with ensigns, arms, and war; Nor soldier's brand, nor baton of command, This hand accursed shall ever grasp again. Your highness by the honour of a prince Stands bound to me in this, and you are bound. King. Ay, if it needs must be, determined spirit! Yet, think again; be it awhile deferr'd, This dismal trial, for a monthâa year. Hen. Not for a day. King. Thou art too boldly stubborn. By what authority dost thou oppose it, If 'tis my pleasure it should be deferr'd? Hen. The law's authority emboldens me. I am Don Juan's heir, and do by right Demand the speedy trial of his murderer. Nor think the law's delay would aught avail. How many secret ways there may be found To rid a wretch of life, who loathes to live. My soul demands this sacrificeâpants for it, As that which can alone restore to it The grace of heav'n and the respect of men. Car. Noble Henriquez, thy too stubborn virtueâ Hen. Nay, Carlos, hold thy peace. Be not my foe: He were my greatest enemy who should Impede this consummation. When 'tis past, Then let the favour of my princely master, Of loving camp-mates, and all virtuous men, Return to me again. A noble treasure That will redeem my memory from shame. King (embracing him). Living or dead, brave man, thou must be honour'd! I will no more contend with thy desires. Some preparation for this solemn ceremony Thou wilt require; Don Carlos will conduct thee Where thou mayst rest and find all needful aid. [Exit. Hen. Come, friends, till I am summon'd to my trial: The time is short, and we must husband it. [Going and stopping again. I shun not now thy friendly aid, good Carlos; My heart is lighten'd of its heavy load, And I can take a good man by the hand, And feel we are akin. Car. To all that is most great and admirable Thou art akin. I have no words to speak The thoughts I have of thee, thou noble man! Hen. (to Antonio). And thou too, gentle youth; give me thy hand. Thy noble confidence did point to me The true and honour'd path. For, hadst thou fled, I might have shrunk aside, and been on earth A sullen secret thing of wretchedness, Cursing the light of heaven. Gentle youth, I've felt the kindly pressure of thy hand, And all thy gen'rous sympathy: forgive me, That I did hold thy mind so long in doubt. Ant. O nothing did I doubt that thou didst know My innocence, and would protect it; yet, This noble, terrible act I ne'er divined. Would I had fled my prison at thy bidding, And lived a vagabond upon the earth, Ere this had been! What was my name or worth? But thouâ Hen. Cease, cease! repent it not, sweet youth; For all the friends on earth would not have done me Such true and worthy service! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A royal apartment. Enter Leonora and Friar. Friar. The king will from his council come ere long; Then wait, I pray, and take a little respite From this impatient fever of your mind. Leo. Take respite! this impatience! O, good father! Thou canst not know this agony, and speakst Like one secured from human misery. Heaven grant me patience! I have need of it; But it must come from heaven. Friar. See; now his highness enters. Enter King attended; and Leonora, running to him, casts herself at his feet, embracing his knees. King. The lady Leonora! rise, dear lady. Leo. No; to your knees I'll cling, nor quit my hold Till from your royal pity I obtain The mercy I implore.âMy lord Henriquezâ Your valiant generalâmy dear, dear husbandâ Say that he shall not die. This execution! This malefactor's end! O save him! save him! King (raising her). As far as I have power, your suit is granted. Leo. Then he is savedâhe lives? Is it not so? King. Alas! I would it were. Your lord refuses All royal mercy. I have sworn to him Never to pardon Juan's murderer. If thou canst move his stubborn spirit, kneel, And at his feet implore him to release me From this most fatal oath. Leo. Move him! Alas, alas! this will not be; I know him well: in what he deems the right, He is inflexible. But solemn oaths, E'en oaths upon the holy relics sworn, The holy church annuls: it will release you. Then say not you are bound. King. From oaths upon the holy relics sworn The church can loose, as thou, no doubt, hast learnt From sacred books and this good father's lore; But, solemnly, upon Henriquez' sword I've pledged a prince's wordâa soldier's honour, From which nought can release me, but the will And free consent of him to whom 'tis pledged. Hie, therefore, to thy lord: kneel at his feet, And may heav'n give thee power to touch his heart. Leo. Is all my hope in this! Unhappy woman! By heaven and man abandon'dâDismal doom! The woe of desperation! [Franticly wringing her hands, and then turning in anger to the King. There's mockery in this. Thou art a king, And canst command what I would beg in vain; Command him, as his royal liege and master, That he release thee from this fatal pledge. A king, and not obey'd! deceitful shadow! Doth not thy power o'er all things reign supreme? King. Not o'er men's wills.â This is a power heaven to itself retains, And ne'er did delegate to mortal being. Leo. (pacing about as before). Despair, despair! What see I but despair, Shame, infamy, a malefactor's end? King. Wring not thy hands so wildly, wretched lady! His life, indeed, we must despair to save; But infamy is from his name remov'd, As heaven from hell. Yea, his proud house shall boast Of this its noble malefactor, more Than all its trophied chiefs. When at the bar he stood arraign'd, and pled, Proving his secret guilt, against himself, Ne'er rose his form so nobly on the mind, Even in his days of triumph.â But when the fatal sentence was pronounced, He raised his head, and sent a look to heav'n Of pleased appeal and solemn thankfulness; A look of pious hope so dignified, He seem'd like some fall'n seraph that again Had won his way to bliss.âA general murmur Of admiration from deep silence rose. Old men did clasp their hands, and young men wept; And those who on his victories bestow'd A cold and niggard praise, now, with full hearts, Gave boundless tribute to his lofty virtue. Leo. And he was honour'd thus! high heaven be prais'd! [Bursting into tears. It makes me weep that they did weep for him. Heaven's will be done! I've been too stern and violent in my grief: God grant me more submission to His will, And I will learn to bear it. My Henriquez! The brave with tears of admiration grace Thy hapless end, and rescue thee from shame. King. Rescue! far more than rescue: his proud house The very implements of execution Will henceforth in their banners proudly weave. Leo. I needs must weep; but let my tears have vent, And I shall be resign'd. Enter Carlos and Antonio. King (to them). How is Henriquez? came ye from his tower? Car. Most admirably well; his soul is up: I left him shaking hands most cordially With his worst enemy, and he intends, Ere close the night's first watch, to spend an hour In social converse with some early friends, Who shared his first campaigns, and have desired To see his face once more.â His soul seems open'd now, and raised above That close reserve, which was his greatest blemish. King. Some noble minds do from misfortune rise, Yea, e'en from guilt, more noble than before; As by the hardest blow the smitten ball Bounds highest from the earth.â Retire, fair Leonora: this good man (pointing to friar) Will heavenly comfort to thy soul impart, And strengthen it to bear the coming trial. [Friar supports her on one side, while Antonio offers his aid also, as she goes off. Leo. (to Ant.) Not thou; the hidden cause of all this woe. Friar. Nay, daughter, be not angry with this youth. The will of heaven must be; the means appointed Must also be: he is most innocent, Since ignorant of ill. Leo. My grief is wayward still; but I'll subdue it. [Takes hold of Antonio, and exit with him and friar, while King, Carlos, and attendants go out by another door. SCENE III. Before the gate of the prison; the stage dark, excepting a lamp hung over the gate; sentinels discovered on watch. Enter Balthazar with a dark lantern. 1st sen. Stand! who art thou? Bal. A friend, connected with the noble prisoner. Sen. Stand there aloof; thou mayst not enter yet. Enter Friar by the opposite side. 1st sen. Ho there! Friar. A friend. 2d sen. A friend! What seekst thou here? Friar. I am a priest, confessor to Henriquez. 1st sen. Thou shalt have entrance presently. Friar. I thank thee. [Going up close to Bal. Thou art Balthazar? Bal. And thy servant, father. Friar. Thou'rt up betimes; it is still pitchy night. Bal. Nay; look thou eastward; you dull line of light, Bounding the sable darkness of the earth From the sky's fainter gloom: it is the dawn. Friar. Ha! runs the time so fast! what noise is that? Bal. The hum of distant voices, and the sound Of preparation for the awful morn. As I now pass'd along, in every street I heard the eager citizens astir, While light from many a lattice gleam'd. And onward, As I approach'd th' appointed place, I saw Round the fenced spot, already gather'd, groups Of men and women, young and old, whose faces Did seem, from darkness, as from nothing sprung, Touch'd with the torches' glaring light, which downward Stream'd from the lofty scaffold, whereon forms Of busy artists at their fatal work, And ghastly headsmen moving to and fro, Appear'd like blacken'd fiends. Dost thou not hear The stroke of hammers, and that sounding plank? There comes a strange and thrilling coldness o'er me. [A pause and noise without. I little thought to feel such ruth for him, The man who slew my good and noble master. Friar. Why shouldst thou not? the feeling does thee honour; And he doth for that rash and rueful deed Make dear and great amends. The gate is open'd. [Exeunt into the prison. SCENE IV. A passage way in the prison. Enter Friar and Gaoler, speaking as they enter. Gaoler. But it is past the hour; he must be waked. Friar. Waked! dost thou think he sleeps? Gaoler. Yes, father; he hath slept, I guess, since midnight. Friar. How knowst thou this? Gaoler. I've listen'd at his door From time to time, and nought have heard within But a deep silence, once or twice brok'n faintly By slow-heaved breathings, as of heavy sleep. Friar. So sound asleep, and such a morn to wake to! Gaoler. Nay, they who sleep before their day of doom Sleep often thus,âa deathlike, dreamless sleep. [Speaking as he goes off. I well remember one, who, on the mornâ [Exeunt. SCENE V. The prison chamber. Henriquez discovered asleep on a couch, near the front of the stage. Enter Friar and Gaoler. Friar. Still fast asleep: it grieves my soul to wake him. No trace of trouble on his face! He lies Like a tired hunter after toilsome chase. Call to him, friend, I cannot. Gaoler. Ho! Don Henriquez! ho, my lord! awake! Awake, my lord!âHe is in heavy sleep, Like the dull rest of death, which hath no ear. Friar. Oh that it were indeed the rest of death! It is a woeful service to awake him. How goes the time? Might he still sleep awhile? Gaoler. 'Tis past the hour at which he charged me strictly To call him up. Friar. Then he must be obey'd. Gaoler (touching him gently). Wake! Don Henriquez, wake! It is the hour. He moves him now: the sound is in his ears; The light annoys his eyes. Awake, my lord! [Touching him again. Hen. (raising his head). What is it? Gaoler. 'Tis the hour the morning breaks. Hen. (starting from his couch). Bring me my armour: have ye roused the camp? Bid every soldier dight him for the field: I've slept too long. Gaoler. It is the very hour At which you did give orders to be waked. Hen. Ha! Yes, I understand thee: it is morn,â The fated morn that brings to me no noon. Sleep from the tablet of my brain had razed All present things, and in my waking fancy Had led me back to what I was so lately. I thank you. Dawns the light? Friar and Gaoler (both at once). The morning breaks. Hen. Your voices sound like midnight, not like morn. Welcome, good father; thou art come, in truth, To wake me for the fight, and brace my strength, Not with corporeal arms. Friar. No, good my lord; A nobler armour, for a nobler warfare: And the Almighty King, whose valiant soldier Thou wilt this day approve thyself to be, Will gird thee for the field. Receive from him His high commission, worthy of a man. Hen. (looking upward, and then kneeling with his arms on his breast, and his head bowed to the ground). I do receive it, father, most devoutly. [Rising with solemnity. Let me be forward in my work, good father. I would retire, and give my thoughts to heaven Ere earthly things shall press to mingle with them. Come, then, and join thy fervent prayers with mine, And teach my dying voice to sue for mercy. [Exit with friar. Gaoler (looking after Henriquez). The right true metal this; 'twill bear the furnace. Ah! who would once have thought that from my custody He should pass forth to such a death? Heaven doom'd it. [Noise and bustle without. What noise is that without?âHo! who would enter? Voice (without). Open; it is the king. [Gaoler opens the door, and enter the King, Carlos, Antonio, and Balthazar. King (to gaoler). Where is thy noble charge? Gaoler. With his confessor, in the private chapel. King. How is he, gaoler? Has he through the night Had any rest? Gaoler. Yes, may it please your highness, He hath slept soundly. King. Sound sleep in such a state! Yet, wherefore marvel: He has been used to look death i' the face. Car. Ay, in the field; but many brave him there, Who on a scaffold feel their manhood quail. King. Is it so, gaoler? Thou hast good experience. Gaoler. Some years ago, two brothers suffer'd here, For an offence of state; the one a soldier, Stout, brave, and bold in war; the other bred To quiet life at home; but on the scaffold The man of peace did bear the loftier brow, And beat the hardy vet'ran shamefully. King. Strange creatures are we all! and who is known Until his trial comes?âI think, good Carlos Thou toldst me he conversed with cheerfulness Till a late hour last night. Car. Yes, good my liege, Having first settled all his worldly cares, Like one, who, from a heavy load released, Unclasps his vest to recreate himself, He with two ancient camp-mates and your liegeman Convers'd with kindlier, more enliven'd freedom Than he was wont: spoke of their old adventures, Prais'd many a valiant heart, fall'n in the field, And of the fate of others did inquire With kindly interest, as though his soul Upon the very parting verge of nature Felt nature's sympathies more warmly. Truly His spirit seem'd already to have doff'd Its earthly coat, and gain'd a purer being. King. Ay; he is passing to a higher state: So teach our holy men, and I believe them. Doth aught approaching to a final end Of dark extinction rise to meet it thus? It doth not;âno, it cannot. But first he settled all his worldly cares. And what are his bequests? Car. Balthazar, thou canst tell. Bal. He first of all provides a noble monument To Juan's mem'ry near his native town, Desiring he himself may be interr'd In the same vault with him, and by his side. For many friends, and all his ancient servants, Forgetting none, he hath made kind provision. His lady's dowry is enlarg'd, and Mencia Receives a noble portion to bestow Upon her early lover, this good youth, Whom he hath named with words of special love. King (to Antonio, who turns aside to weep.) Weep freely, gentle youth; whom he hath loved Shall ever in his prince's favour hold An honourable place.âPray thee, proceed. Bal. He hath, besides, for good and pious ends, A large benevolenceâ Car. Hush! he approaches. Re-enter Henriquez and Friar. King (advancing to meet him). My noble friend, I felt a strong desire Once moreâa short intrusion. Hen. Say not so. Your grace is come to wish me a good morrow, And cheer me on this outset of my way. King. Alas! a dismal cheer, a woful morrow! Hen. Nay, three successive days have dawn'd upon me Through such a gloom of hopeless misery, That this, comparatively, seems indeed A morn of cheer. Then so consider it. And now, in parting, I would beg of you To pardon whatsoe'er, in my long service, I've done, in ignorance or stubborn will, To prejudice the service of the state, Or to offend your grace. Once at Cuenca I rashly hazarded some brave men's lives; And, for th' unmeaning triumph of a day, Those brave men's lives were lost. My heart for this Has suffer'd many a pang; but pride till now Restrain'd confession. Pardon me for this. King. Thou needst from me no pardon; yet thou hast it, And with it, too, my thanks,âmy solemn thanks, For all the noble service thou hast done me. And is there no request thou hast to make? Hen. Yes, if I might presume. Here is a list [Giving the King a paper. Of some brave officers, whose worthy services Deserve promotion: let them, for my sake, Find favour with your grace. This is my suit. King. It shall be done. Oh that a suit of mine Could, in return, move thine obdurate bosom! Hen. What is't, my gracious master? King. If I have been to thee a gracious master, Be thou a gracious liegeman, and restoreâ Restore to me that honour of my reign, That pride, and fence, and bulwark of my land,â Restore to me again my gallant general, Henriquez d'Altavera. Hen. Alphonso of Castile, I've serv'd thee long,â Yea, though I say it, I have served thee bravely. Have I from fire, or flood, or havoc shrunk? What battle have I lost, what town abandon'd, That now I may not, like a noble Spaniard, My earthly station quit, from insult spared? I've owed you service as my rightful king; I've owed you service as my gracious master: But not for man on earth, nor saint in heaven, Would I submit a loathed life to live, After the horrid deed that I have done. Friar (laying his hand gently on Henriquez). My son, my son! where is the Christian meekness, Which, at the Throne of Grace, some moments since, Thou didst devoutly pray for? Hen. Father, I am reproved: my mortal frailty Was smother'd, not extinct. [Turning to the King. I will not, standing on this awful verge, To mortal greatness bend, else on my knees I'd crave forgiveness of this new offence: [Laying his hand sorrowfully on his breast. An unrein'd mind, offending to the last! [The King rushes into his arms and embraces him; then turns away, retiring to the bottom of the stage, to conceal strong emotion. Hen. Carlos, thou wilt not leave me till the end; But thou'lt forgive me now the many wrongs I've done thine honest worth, fastidiously Bestowing confidence on one alone. [Taking his hand affectionately. (Turning to Antonio.) And thou, brave youth, I know thy gen'rous soul. Though I have held thee long in doubt, I trust Thou partst with me in charity. Ant. (catching his hands, and kissing them fervently). In love, In deepest admiration, in devotion That for thy sake would make me welcome death, Yea, suffer shame, or be an outlaw'd wretch, Cast off from all my kind. Hen. Come to my heart! think of me when I'm gone; And be my fate thy warning. For I see Keen passions and affections in thy nature, Akin to those I felt in early youth. And when thou thinkst of me, consider this: The law condemneth not a man unheard, Be he the veriest wretch upon the earth: But I condemn'd my dearest friend unheard. Balthazar, thou dost know how very dearâ No, no! thou couldst not know how well I loved him. Farewell, good secretary, and be sure Thou mind thy charge. See that it be erected With strength and skill; a noble monument, That will resist the silent strokes of time. (Looking round.) Where is my ancient servant, good Diego? How is it that I do not see him here? Bal. On learning that your sentence was pronounced, He took his bed; and whether violent grief Or other means did speed his end, I know not: He died last night. Hen. Then I shall meet him shortly, where the servant, Freed from his master, fears his wrath no more. My poor Diego! he did live with me In too much awe: and yet he loved me well. I was to blame in this. Enter Leonora and Mencia. Car. Thy Leonora comes. Hen. Ah! would she had been spared this dismal parting! Car. She would not be restrain'd. Hen. My Leonora, wherefore art thou come? Yet thou art welcome to my heart once more. Farewell in love,âin true, in most dear love, My dearest wife! Leo. Oh no! thy cruel wife, The cause of all thy misery,âthy bane. Hen. (embracing her). Hush, hush! thou wast my torment and my bliss, But O! far more my bliss! So be content. I have had many days of prosperous life Before this storm of misery broke upon me, Thy love the flower and crown of all. Be comforted! And Mencia, too, sweet maid, I understand Thy mute farewell, which I accept. God bless thee! Antonio, take thy charge. [Putting Mencia's hand in his. Heaven bless thee, and farewell, my dearest wifel Leo. Not yet, not yet! my swelling heart will burst. It tries to utter what it cannot.âOh! [A bell tolls, and she, giving a loud shriek, falls into the arms of Mencia and Antonio. Hen. Bear her away; I may not look again! [As she is borne off, the King advances to the front. King. Farewell, thou noble man! Part we in charity? Hen. In charity; and on your royal head My dying blessing rest! [Exit King. Here comes the marshal. Enter Marshal and other officers. (To the marshal.) Are all things ready, then? [The marshal bows. (To Carlos and friar.) My faithful friends, Who still cling to my latest throb of life, I claim of you a kind but painful service! [He begins to move, the friar walking by his side, and Carlos following, while the bell tolls, and a large door in the centre of the back scene being thrown open, discovers a grand arched passage, lined with guards and other public officers, who, as he passes along, join the procession. The curtain drops. END OF THE PLAYS ON THE PASSIONS.</field>

A noise of voices and unruly merriment is heard, whilst the curtain draws up, and discovers Count Zaterloo, Bernard, Sebastian, and others of their band, seated round a table with wine, &amp;c. Zat. Ha, ha, ha, ha! with all this noisy mirth, Should some grave stranger, on his way misled, Now push the door ajar, and look upon us Thus set, what class of men should we be deem'd? A set of light hearts, snug in fortune's lap, Who will not go to bed because we may? Or club of sharpers, flush'd with full success, New from the spoiling of some simple fool? Or troop of strolling players, at our ease, After the labours of our kingly sorrows, With throats new cool'd at as great charge of wine As our tough lungs have cost of lady's tears? Ber. No, no, thou hast not hit upon it yet: He'd take thee for the heir of some old miser, Treating thy friends, as first fruits of thy kingdom, With flowing bumpers to the quiet rest Of thy good kinsman's soul. Zat. Yes, Bernard, thou sayst well: and thy dark visage, Lank and unsuited to all mirth, would mark thee The undertaker, who amongst the guests Had come on matters of his sable trade, Grinning a strange, uncomely, jaw-bone smile O'er the near prospect of his future gains. Seb. Methinks, at least, in this gay, jolly band, He scarcely would discover needy men, Who better days have seen. Zat. Tut, man! thou art too grave; thou art too graveâ Which of you sung that song with merry lay, Some few nights since? Come, let us have it now. SONG. Ye who fin would happy be, Give the hand, and join with me: They who toil the weary day, They who bend with locks of grey, They who tread the beaten way, Fools who work that we may play, Fold their weary arms to sleep, Come, let us our vigil keep. Fellows, join, and never fear; Ye who would be happy, hear. With the sober and the meek, Lighter flies the passing week? In his dwelling warm and sleek, Brighter smiles the rich man's cheek? Wiser things may wise men say, But we are wiser far than they. Come, light spirits, light and free, Wisest they who foolish be. He who hammers at the pot, He who brews for every sot, He who made my hose and coat, Is a better man I wot; Yet were we form'd, events declare, He to work and I to wear. Mistress of the misty shroud, O, lovely moon! come from thy cloud. When thou o'erlookst the ocean's brine, Ourselves we view in floods of wine. Our constancy resembles thine; Like thee in borrow'd robes we shine; Then let us, in thy kindred light, Still wake, the rulers of the night. Zat. It is a song of Halbert's, is it not? He was a social jolly-hearted mate, And had a knack of making ready rhymes. Ber. I knew him well: what has become of him? Zat. (pretending not to hear). Fill up your glass, and let the flask go round. Ber. What has become of Halbert, dost thou know? Zat. (still pretending not to hear). This wine is richly flavour'd, is it not? Ber. It is.âBut Halbert; know ye aught of him? Zat. The devil take thy question, asking spirit! For when thou getst a notion by the skirt, Thou, like an English bull-dog, keepst thy hold, And wilt not let it go.â He shot himself in prison some months since: Now, there's thine answer for thee; art thou satisfied? [A deep and long pause; then Zaterloo starts up as if he recollected something. He will be with us ere I've pav'd his way. Seb. Hast thou some new associate to propose? Zat. Know ye the younger branch of Valvo's house? Whose valiant father left him but his sword And his proud spirit, through this changeful world To shape his way, with heart as truly temper'd To all the softest witch'ries of refinement As e'er own'd cherish'd heir of wide domains, In palace nurs'd. Seb. I've seen him when a youth. But he since then has of a foreign state The soldier been; and had not now return'd, But in the hope, 'tis said, of being heir To his great uncle's vast and rich possessions, Of which that villain Hubert has depriv'd him With treach'rous wiles. Poor heart! he has my pity. 'Tis said a ling'ring fever seiz'd upon him From disappointment; and I marvel not; The stroke was most severe. Zat. And felt more keenly, For that he left behind him, in the country To which he now belongs, a gentle maid And his betroth'd, with whom he thought to share His promis'd wealth. But these things rest.âThus driven as we are To this uncertain, daring course of life, The stronger and the more respectable Our band, the greater chance of prospering. Our number is too small; and, by my soul, To see a mean, plebeian, vulgar knave, Admitted of our fellowship, still rubs Against my nature. Such a man as Rayner Is precious, and, once gain'd, is sure and steadfast. But few days since I met him, dark and thoughtful, With melancholy and unwonted gait Slow saunt'ring through lone, unfrequented paths, Like one whose soul from man's observing eye Shrinks gall'd, as shrinks the member newly torn From every slightest touch. Seeing him thus, I mark'd him for my man. Ber. Didst thou accost him? Zat. Yes; when to my greeting, âThou seest I am unhappy, go thy ways,â He fretful said, and turn'd. I still persisted, With soothing words which thrill'd against his heart, (For in our youthful days we once were playmates,) Like the sweet tones of some forgotten song, Till, like a pent-up flood swoln to the height, He pour'd his griefs into my breast with tears, Such as the manliest men in their cross'd lives Are sometimes forced to shed. Seb. And spoke he of his love? Zat. Nay, there indeed He was reserv'd; but that part of his story, Which I from sure authority have learnt, I still through broken words could shrewdly read, Although he named it not. Ber. Hast thou explain'd to him our course of life? Zat. No, that had been too much; but canst thou doubt, Suff'ring such wrongs as Hubert's artful baseness Has put upon him, he will scruple long, Thus circumstanced, to join his arm with ours In murd'ring the rich villain? Ber. (looking at Sebastian, who shrinks back). I pray thee call it shooting! that plain word Still makes Sebastian, like a squeamish dame, Shrink and look lily-faced. To shoot a man As one in battle shoots a fronted foe; As from the tavern's broil, in measured field, One shoots a friend, is nought: â but that word murderâ It hath a horrid sound; pray thee, good captain, Remember 'tis a band of gentlemen Thou dost command, and let such gentle phrase Fall from thy tongue as gentle ears may suit. [Omnes laughing loud at Sebastian. Zat. Hush! Rayner is at hand, I hear his steps. Enter Rayner. I give you welcome, Rayner, with my heart: These are my friends, of whom I well might boast, But that it seems like boasting of myself. Here, take your place, and join our fellowship. There is but little need of ceremony With those whom like misfortunes bring together. Ray. I take my seat, honour'd in such a place; And so far to misfortune am indebted, Which has procur'd it for me. [Sits down. Ber. (drinking to Rayner). This do I fill to future fellowship: To that which makes, at fortune's lowest ebb, A few brave men united, mock the world And all its plodding rules; enabling them Boldly to seize their portion of life's feast, Which griping av'rice or unjust oppression Would from them snatch, whilst with insulting scorn It scoffs at poverty and patient want. Ray. Thou truly sayst; at least I have observ'd That those who bear misfortunes over meekly Do but persuade mankind that they and want Are all too fitly match'd to be disjoin'd, And so to it they leave them. Ber. 'Tis ever so: E'en good men then neglect them; but the base, They, who by mean and undermining arts To o'ergrown wealth attain, like the ass's heel 'Gainst the sick lion's low and lanken breast, Spurn at them. Zat. Yes, good Bernard, thou speakst truly. For I myself, who, as thou knowst right well, Am not too meekly to misfortune bent, Have somewhat of the worthless ass's kick Against my bosom felt.â'Lone and unarm'dâ Had but one brave companion by my side My anger shared, full dearly had the knaveâ But let it pass,âhe had a brave man's curse, And that will rest upon him. Ber. But, pray thee, count, tell us the circumstance: Thou speakst in mystery. Zat. A few days since, returning near my home, Upon a narrow path raised from a road With mud choked up, behind me trampling came, A band of liv'ried rascals at his heels, In all his awkward state, a puff'd-up worldling, And rode me off my way; whilst looking back, He turn'd his head with a malicious grin At the poor spatter'd wretch, who in the mud Stood showering curses on him. Ray. Ay, 'tis the cursed insolence of wealth That makes the poor man poor. Thou wast unarm'd? Zat. I was; or by this hand, poor as I am, I should have spent a brace of bullets on him With much good-will. Ray. Knowst thou the villain's name? Zat. Faith, I'm almost ashamed to tell it thee. Thou knowst him well: he is a rich man now; His name is Hubert. Ray. There lives no blacker villain on the earth Than he who bears it.âBut thou knowst it all. When from a distant country, where with honour I earn'd a soldier's pittance, the fair promises Of a near kinsman tempted me, and I, Though by my nature most incautious, And little skill'd to gain by flatt'ring arts An old man's love, high in his favour stood; That villain Hubert roused his jealous nature With artful tales of slights and heir-like wishes, And covert mock'ry of his feeble age, Till, in the bitterness of changed love, All his vast wealth he did bequeath to him, And left me here, e'en in this stranger's land (For years of absence makes it so to me), A disappointed, friendless, unknown man, Poor and depress'd, such as you see me now. Ber. Double, detested, cruel-hearted villain! Zat. (starting up with affected vehemence). By heaven he dies, as I do wear this arm! [They all start up. Defended by a host of liv'ried knaves, I'd seek him out alone. Ber. Thou shalt not go alone; here, heart and hand We will all join thee in so good a cause. 1st gent. My arm is at thy will. 2d gent. Take my aid too; We never can be bold in better cause. 3d gent. (on receiving a sign from Zaterloo). Then, sirs, you must be speedy with your vengeance, For I am well inform'd that on to-morrow, With all his treasure, for a distant province He will begin his journey towards eve. Zat. Ha! then good fortune leads him to our hands; How goes he guarded? 3d gent. With a slender train. Zat. Then thanks to fortune's fav'ring smiles, which thus, Whilst we but seek revenge for a friend's wrongs, So kindly throws into our heedless way The easy cure of our necessities. Yes, let us seize the greedy glutted villain! Let us disgorge him of his ill-got gains! He long enough has rioted in ease, Whilst better men have felt the gripe of want. Ber. Yes, let it be so, let the villain die! Zat. What sayst thou, Rayner? thou alone art silent. Ray. The wrongs are mine, and if with indignation They fill your breasts, in strong desire of vengeance Ye well may guess I am not far behind: But there's a law above all human bonds, Which damps the eager beating of my heart, And says, âdo thou no murder.â Zat. Well, clear thy knitted brows, nor look thus strangely. We both are form'd, my friend, to know like feelings, Like wants and wishes, and from better days Both are reduced to fortune's lowest ebb: And I as well as thou, standing thus singly, Can feed my fancy up with strong conceits Of what in letter'd lore is virtue term'd, And bear its darkest frowns. There was a time, When sharing ev'ry wish and ev'ry view With one of weaker frame and softer soul; Yet forced by the dark frowns of adverse fortune To live a willing outlaw from her presence, Because I could not bear to come before her A poor despised man, reft of that comeliness And honest grace which independence gives, To bid her throw aside her flowing robes And decent ornaments of maiden pride, Unveil the sweetness of her shelter'd beauty To beating mid-day heats and chilling winds, And be a wand'ring vagrant by my side;â There was a time, my friend, when, thus beset, At view of any means to better fortune, A stronger pow'r had ris'n within my breast And mock'd at law. But, standing thus alone, I can as well as thou forego the gain Which this occasion offers.âLet it pass! There is within us, be it superstition, Th'unscann'd opinions from our childhood cherish'd, Or natural instinct, still a strong aversion To ev'ry act of blood. Let us yield to it: We will not strain our nature from its bent: We'll do no violent deed. Ray. (catching hold of Zaterloo with great agitation). O thou hast moved me! thou hast conjured thought! Wast thou â wast thou indeed thus circumstnaced? And thy deserted love; what was her fate? Zat. She felt not long the cruel separation: One lovely bush of the pale virgin thorn, Bent o'er a little heap of lowly turf, Is all the sad memorial of her worth; All that remains to mark where she is laid. Ray. Oh! Oh! and was it thus! Zat. But let us now shake off these dismal thoughts, This hour was meant for social fellowship: Resume your seats, my friends, and, gentle Rayner, Clear up thy cloudy brows and take thy place. Ray. I fain would be excused. Zat. (gently forcing him to sit down). Nay, no excuse: Thou must perforce a social hour or two Spend with us. To ye all, my noble friends, Drinks. I fill this cup. â Bernard, how goes thy suit? Hast thou yet to thy greedy lawyer's pocket Convey'd thy hindmost ducat? Ha, ha, ha! Had he, with arms in hand, ta'en from thee boldly Half of the sum, thou wouldst have called him robber. Ha, ha, ha! [Laughing heartily. Ber. Yes, thou mayst laugh: We nice distinctions make.âI had an uncle, Who once upon a timeâ Zat. I hope, good Bernard, Thy story will be shorter than thy suit. [Rayner, who has been sitting in gloomy thoughtfulness, without attending to any thing around him, whilst Zaterloo has been keeping an eye of observation on him, now rises up in great agitation to go away. Zat. What is the matter, Rayner? Ray. I am disturb'dâI know not how I amâ Let me take leave, I pray you. Zat. Thou shalt not quit us thus. What is the matter? Ray. Question me not: my thoughts are all confused: There is a strong temptation fasten'd on me. I am not well. Zat. (aside to Bernard). Ay, now it works upon him: This will doâ [Aloud, and preventing Rayner from going. If thou'rt unwell, art thou not with thy friends? Ray. If ye indeed are friends, not spirits enleagued To force me to my ruin, let me goâ Let me go to my home. Zat. What, dost thou call a bare unfurnish'd chamber, With griping landlord clam'ring in thine ears For what he knows thou canst not give, thy home? Ray. (sighing deeply). I have no other. Zat. Stay thou here with us: In the next chamber thou shalt rest awhile. Lead him, my kind Sebastian, by the hand: There is a sort of woman's kindliness About thy nature, which befits thee best To be a sick man's friend. I'll follow you. [Exit Rayner, leaning on Sebastian; turning about to his friends triumphantly as they go off. I have secured my man. [A voice heard without. But hark! a voice without! It is my mother's. Secure the latticed door. Plague on her kindness To haunt me here! I have forgot my promise. (To Bernard.) Make fast the latticed door and answer for me. Ber. (after fastening a door of lattice work through which the countess is seen). Who's there? what want ye? Countess (without). I want my son: I pray you is he here? Ber. He is not here. Countess (without). Nay, say not so, I think he is with you. O tell him I have sate these three long hours, Counting the weary beatings of the clock, Which slowly portion'd out the promised time That brought him not to bless me with his sight. If he is well, why does he thus forget? And if he is not, as I fear he is not, Tell me the worst, and let me be with him To smooth his couch and raise his sickly head. Zat. (aside to Bernard). Tell her it is unseemly for a mother To run about like a new foolish wife. Ber. If you complain thus movingly, fair widow, We shall believe you seek a second husband In lieu of your good son; and by my truth It were a better errand. Countess. O base of thought, as most unblest of speech! My son is not with you: it cannot be: I did him wrong to seek him in such company. Ber. (speaking loud after her as she retires from the door). Not far from hence, there is a nightly meeting Of worthy, sober, well-disposed folks, Who once a week do offer up their prayers And chant most saintly hymns till morning dawn, It is more likely you will find him there. [Omnes laughing. Zat. She's gone. Ber. Yes, yes; come from thy hiding place. Zat. Now what a most unreasonable woman! Thinks she, thus ripen'd to these manly years, That I must run whene'er my finger aches To lean my silly head upon her lap? 'Tis well I have no wife. Ber. Ay, so it is. There is no pleasing those high legal dames With endless claims upon a man's regard: Heaven save us from them all! Zat. Well, this I drink to precious liberty: He is a fool indeed who parts with that. [A loud voice and bustling heard without. What's this comes next to plague us? Ber. 'Tis Mira's voice. Zat. Hast thou not sent to say, that urgent bus'ness Detains me from her banquet? Ber. I have; I sent to her a written message. Zat. Keep fast the door, and I will stand conceal'd. [Conceals himself, and Mira appears through the latticed door.Mira (without.) Where is Count Zaterloo? Let me pass on. Ber. Affairs of greatest consequence detain him. My beauteous Mira; and I needs must say That now you may not pass.â He's much concern'd: early upon the morrow He will be with you. Mira. Upon the morrow! prate not thus to me! He shall to-night go with me where I list, Or never see my face again. To-morrow! Open the door, I say! this weakly barrier Shall not oppose my way. [Beating violently against the door. Zat. (aside to Bernard). Faith, I believe we must e'en let her in: She may do some rash thing, if we persist. [Bernard unbolts the door; Zaterloo comes from his concealment; and enter Mira, superbly dressed, and in a violent passion. Mira. Is this the way you keep your promises? Is this your faith? is this your gallantry? Zat. Mira, my gentle love, I pray thee hear me! I sent to tell thee business of great moment. Mira. Yes, yes! I have received your scurvy message, And well I know that ev'ry paltry matter Is cause sufficient for neglecting me. Zat. Thou knowst to be from thee is painful to me. Mira. So it should seem, by taking so much care To comfort you the while. [Pointing to the wine, &amp;c. You do your bus'ness jovially, methinks. Zat. Thou art too warm: accuse me as thou wilt Of aught but want of love. Mira. O, thou deceitful man! I know thee well: Thou talkst of love and thou wouldst break my heart. Zat. Indeed I am to blame, my gentle love; Yet be not thus: in token of forgiveness This friendly cup receive, and smile upon me. [Offering her a cup, which she dashes to the ground. Mira. Off with thy hateful gifts! nought from thy hands Will I receive; I scorn thy offering. E'en the rich robe thou hast so often promised, Ay and so oft forgot, so I must call it, I would now scorn, since thou dost slight my love. Zat. Indeed, my Mira, thou shalt have that robe Before two days be past: I swear to thee. Then do not look so frowningly, my love; I know thou hast a soft relenting nature; Smile my forgiveness. Mira. O thou provoking man! thou knowst full well It is thyself and not thy gifts I prize: Thou knowst too well how my fond doating heart Is moved with the soft witch'ry of thy tongue; Yet thou wilt vex me thus, and break my heart. Oh! 'tis too much! [Pretending to burst into tears. Zat. I cannot see thee weep: what wouldst thou have? Mira. I will have nought, unless you go with me. Zat. I cannot now, for I have urgent bus'ness. Mira. Then stay, and never see my face again. O that some friendly hand would end my days, Since I have lived to see me thus despised. Zat. (aside to Bernard). Bernard, I think I must e'en go with her. See thou to Rayner: I will soon return. (Aloud.) Then let us go, my love, thou dost compel me. Thy hand, sweet Mira. [Exeunt Zaterloo and Mira. Ber. Well, gentle friends, it is blest liberty Our noble chief enjoys. I must to Rayner. Stay if you will, and keep you merry here. Omnes. No, we are tir'd, we will retire to rest. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Rayner's lodgings. Enter Rayner alone. Ray. Be still, ye idle thoughts that toss me thus, Changing like restless waves, but ever dark; Or one of you above his fellows rise, And bear a steady rule. Adversity! Thou'st come upon me like an ambush'd foe In armed strength. If I had mark'd thy course, I might have girt myself for thine approach, While distant still, and met thee like a man. But when new-fetter'd in a lover's bonds, And dazzled too with hope's deceitful brightness, Cam'st thou like a thick cloud of desert sand, And in dark night o'erwhelm'd me: deepest night, Through which no waking vision ever gleams, Save thy grim visage only, loathly want, In all thy varied forms of misery. My night, my day dreams, ah! how are ye changed, Since in the new-betroth'd, the lover's fancy, Ye wove your sheeny maze of mingled thoughts, Like sparkling dew-webs in the early sun! [After a pause. Elizabeth! methinks e'en now I see her. As in the horrors of my last night's dream, When, after following her through flood and fire, She turn'd to me, and her weak arms stretch'd forth. But ah! how changed, how pale, and spent, and keen! As if already blighting poverty, That portion which her love must share with me, Had marr'dâcease, cease, base thought, it shall not be! Enter Herman with a knapsack on his back, as if prepared for a journey. What, my good Herman, art thou so soon ready? Her. Yes, my dear master, but if you think it too soon, I will not go to-day. Nay if it were not that you force me to go, I should as soon have thought of deserting my friend (pardon my boldness, sir) in a wild wood amongst savages, as leaving you here in this strange place in the state you are in at present. Pardon my boldness, sir. Ray. Thou hast no boldness to pardon, Herman: thou art well entitled to call thyself my friend; there is not one amongst those who have borne that name, who would have done more for me than thou hast done. Her. Ah, sir! Ray. (assuming a look of cheerfulness). Fy, do not look so sadly upon me, man; thanks to thy good nursing and the good broth thou hast made me, I am getting strong again: and as for the state of my coffers, for which thou so much concernest thyself, do not let that disturb thee. My tide of means is, to be sure, pretty well ebbed just now; but some wind or other will spring up to set it a flowing again. In the mean time thou knowest I would travel alone: perhaps I may ramble about a little while mysteriously, like the wandering Jew-or some of those lonely philosophers which thy old stories tell thee about, and there is no knowing what I may find out to do me good. The philosopher's stone, thou knowest, may as well fall into my hands as those of any other wanderer: so pray thee, man, don't look so ruefully upon me. Her. Ah, my dear master! there is something here that hangs heavy on my heart, and says, if I leave you now, some evil will befall you: I beseech you let me stay with you, I shall find something to do in this town, and I canâ Ray. No, no, no! Speak of this no moreâwe have argued this point already. And what is this which thou puttest down so slily upon the table? [Taking up a little packet which Herman has put secretly upon the table. Ha! the jewels I have given thee in room of thy wages! out upon it! thou wilt make me angry with thee now, and it grieves me to be angry with thee. Put it up, put it up: I command thee to do it; and thou knowest I have not often used this stern word. Her. O no, sir! You have not indeed used it; and I shall never meet with another master like you. Ray. Thou wilt meet, I hope, my dear Herman, with a far better master than I have been to thee, though not with one for whom thou wilt do so much kindly service as thou hast done for me; and for this cause, perhaps, thou wilt not love him so much. God prosper thee for it, wherever thou goest!â Take this embrace and blessing for all thou hast done for me. Farewell! farewell! thou must be gone now, indeed thou must. God bless thee, my good Herman. [Pushing Herman gently off the stage, who wipes his eyes and seems unwilling to go. [Exit Herman. Ray. (alone). Now, am I left alone: there's no one near me That e'er hath loved or cared for me. Methinks I now can better look i' th' surly face Mine alter'd state, and bear to be in want. I am alone, and I am glad of it. Alas! changed heart of mine! what is that state Which gives to thee such thoughts?âElizabethâ Again, again! This strong idea still! I am distracted when I think of this: Therefore I must not, if I would be honest. Those menâor are they men or are they devils? With whom I met last night; they've fasten'd on me Fell thoughts, which, though I spurn them, haunt me still. Would I had never met them! Here comes my landlord with his surly face Of debts and claims, and ev'ry irksome thing. Enter Landlord with a letter. Good morrow, landlord. Land. I thank you, sir; I am glad to hear you call me landlord; for I began to be afraid you had mistaken me for your host. Ray. I understand you well enough, and indeed I have proved your patience, or rather your impatience, much longer than I wished. You have a letter in your hand. Land. (giving it). There, sir; if it bring you the news of any good luck, I shall be glad of it. Ray. (agitated). From Elizabeth, Good morning âgood morning to you. Land. Read it, sir, and see if it bring you any good news; it is time now to look for some change in your favour. Ray. I cannot open it whilst thou art here. Have the goodness at least not to stand so near me. Land. So I must not occupy a place in my own house, forsooth, for fear of offending the good folks who do me the honour to live in it. [Retires to the bottom of the stage, muttering to himself. Ray. (after opening the letter with great emotion and reading it). O What is this?â Abandon'd by the friend with whom she liv'd, And coming here to join me with all speed! O God! O God! [Sinks down upon a chair in violent agitation. Land. (running up to him). What is the matter now? Ray. Begone, begone! I cannot answer thee. Enter Count Zaterloo. Zat. Ha, Rayner! how is't with thee? thou lookst wildly. (To landlord.) Speak to me, friend: he heeds not what I say: Has any new misfortune happen'd to him? Land. I fear there has, sir. Zat. Rouse thee up, brave Rayner, A friend is come to thee. Ray. (starting up). Ha, is it thou? Com'st thou upon me now, my tempter? now, E'en in my very moment of distraction? Thou knowst thy time: some fiend has whisper'd to thee. Ay, ay! say what thou wilt. Zat. Thou'rt surely mad; I came not, on my word, To say aught to thee which an honest ear Might not receive; nor will I even speak, Since it so moves theeâ Ray. (interrupting him eagerly). Ah, but thou must! Thou must speak that, which, in its darkest hour, Push'd to extremity, 'midst ringing dizziness The ear of desperation doth receive, And I must listen to it. Zat. What, sayst thou so? 'Tis well (aside), but be more prudent, We are o'erheard. [Looking suspiciously to landlord, who has retired a few paces behind. Come with me to my lodgings; There wait my friends; all things shall be concerted: Come with me, instantly; the time is precious. Ray. (in a tone of despair, clasping his hands vehemently). Ay, ay! I'll go with thee. [Exeunt Count Zaterloo and Rayner: Manet landlord. Landlord (coming forward). What's this I've overheard? Is this devil now going to tempt the poor distressed young man to do some foul deed in his necessity?âI have tempted him too, with my hard-hearted murmuring about the few wretched pounds that he owes me. I'll run after him and say, I don't care whether he pay me or not. (Running to the door and then stopping short.) No, no! softly, softly! I dare say it is only some sharping business they have got on hand, such as needy gentlemen are sometimes forced to follow: I have got my conscience newly cleared off at confession last week, and I am to make an offering next holy-day to the shrine of our patron St. Bernard; this is no time, good sooth, to lose such a sum upon scruples. [Exit. ACT II. SCENE I. A wood: dark night, with a pale gleam of distant lightning seen once or twice on the edge of the horizon. Advancing by the bottom of the stage, a few moving lights, as if from lanterns, are seen, and at the same time several signal calls and loud whistles are heard, with the distant answer returned to them from another part of the wood. Enter Count Zaterloo, Rayner, Sebastian, and others of the band, armed, and a few of them bearing in their hands dark lanterns. It is particularly requested, if this play should ever be acted, that no light may be permitted upon the stage but that which proceeds from the lanterns only. Zat. (to Seb.). They must be near: didst thou not hear their call? Seb. Methought I did; but who in this wild wood May credit give to either eye or ear? How oft we've been deceiv'd with our own voices, From rocky precipice or hollow cave, 'Midst the confused sound of rustling leaves, And creaking boughs, and cries of nightly birds, Returning seeming answer! Zat. Rayner, where standest thou? Ray. Here, on thy left. Zat. Surely these wild scenes have depriv'd thy tongue Of speech. Let's hear thy voice's sound, good man, To say thou art alive. Thou'rt marvellous silent: Didst thou not also hear them? Ray. I know not truly if I did. Around me, All seems like the dark mingled mimicry Of fev'rish sleep; in which the half-doubting mind, Wilder'd, and weary, with a deep-drawn breath, Says to itself, âShall I not wake?â Zat. Fy man! Wilt thou not keep thy soldier's spirit up? To-morrow's sun will be thy waking time, And thou wilt wake a rich man and a free. Ray. My waking time!âno, no! I must sleep on, And have no waking. Zat. Ha! does thy mind misgive thee on the brink? Ray. What passes in my mind, to thee is nothing, If my hand do the work that's fasten'd on me. Let's pass to it as quickly as thou wilt, And do not speak to me.â Enter Bernard and others, armed, &amp;c. Zat. Well met, my friends! well met! for we despair'd Of ever seeing you. Seb. Yet we have heard your voices many times, Now calling us on this side, now on that, As though you had from place to place still skipp'd, Like Will o'the Wisp, to lose us on our way. Ber. We've fared alike: so have we thought of you. Zat. Have you discover'd aught of those we seek? Ber. No; all is still, as far as we have traversed: No gleaming torch gives notice from afar, Nor trampling hoofs sound on the distant road. Zat. Then must we take again our sev'ral routes, That haply we may learn, ere he approach, What strength we have to face, and how he travels: And that we may not wander thus again, This aged oak shall be our meeting place; Where having join'd, we'll by a shorter compass Attack them near the centre of the wood. Seb. The night grows wondrous dark: deepswelling gusts And sultry stillness take the rule by turns; Whilst o'er our heads the black and heavy clouds Roll slowly on. This surely bodes a storm. Zat. I hope the devil will raise no tempest now, To save this child of his, and from his journey Make him turn back, crossing our fortunes. Ber. Fear not! For, be the tempest of the devil's raising, It will do thee no harm. To his good favour Thou hast (wrong not thy merit) claims too strong. Zat. Then come on, friends, and I shall be your warrant! Growl sky and earth and air, ne'er trouble ye; They are secure who have a friend at court. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A different part of the wood, wild and savage: the scene still darkened, and a storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied with hail. Enter Rayner. Ray. I know not where these men have shelter'd them. I've miss'd their signal: this loud stunning din Devours all other sounds. Where shall I go? Athwart this arch of deep embodied darkness, Swift shiv'ring lightnings glare, from end to end Mantling the welkin o'er in vivid flames; Or from aloft, like sheeted cataracts Of liquid fire, seem pour'd. E'en o'er my head The soft and misty-textured clouds seem changed To piles of harden'd rocks, which from their base, Like the up-breaking of a ruin'd world, Are hurl'd with force tremendous. Patt'ring hail Beats on my shrinking form with spiteful force: Where shall I shelter me? Ha! through the trees Peers, near at hand, a small but settled light: I will make quickly towards it; perhaps There may be some lone dwelling in the wood. [Exit. SCENE III. The inside of a cave: an old man discovered sitting by a small table made of coarse planks, with a lamp burning dimly upon it: the thunder heard still very loud. Old man. Doth angry heav'n still roll its loudest peal O'er th' unblest head? Ay, through its deaf'ning roar I hear the blood-avenging Spirit's voice, And, as each furious turmoil spends its strength, Still sounds upon the far-receding storm Their distant growl. 'Tis hell that sends its fire and devils up To lord it in the air. The very wind, Rising in fitful eddies, horribly sounds, Like bursts of damned howlings from beneath. Is this a storm of nature's elements? O, no, no, no! the blood-avenging spirits Ride on the madding clouds: there is no place, Not in the wildest den, wherein may rest The unblest head. [Knocking heard without. âHa! knocking at my door! [Pauses and listens, much alarmed: knocking heard still louder. Say, who art thou that knockst so furiously? Thinkst thou the clouds are sparing of their din, That thou must thunder too? Say who thou art, And what thou wouldst at such an hour as this, In such a place? Ray. (without). I am a lone and tempest-beaten traveller, Who humbly begs a shelter from the night. Old man. Then art thou come where guest yet never enter'd. Ray. (without). I do not ask admittance as a guest. Wouldst thou not save a creature from destruction, E'en a dumb animal? unbar the door, And let me lay my body under shelter. [Old man makes no answer; the storm heard very loud. Ray. (without). If thou'rt a man in nature as in voice, Thou canst not sit at peace beneath thy roof, And shut a stranger out to the rude night. I would, so circumstanced, have shelter'd thee. Old man. He tries to move me with a soothing voice. (Aloud.) Thou art a knave; I will not let thee in. Aside. Ray. (without). Belike I am, yet do not fear my wiles: All men are honest in a night like this. Old man. Then I will let thee in: whoe'er thou art: Thou hast some sense, shouldst thou lack better things. [He unbars a small door, and Rayner enters, much ruffled and exhausted by the storm, and without his hat. Ray. I'm much beholden to thee. Old man. No, thou art not. Ray. The violence of the night must plead my pardon, For breaking thus unask'd upon your rest. But wand'ring from my way, I know not how, And losing my companions of the road, Deep in the 'tangled wood the storm o'ertook me; When spying through the trees this glimm'ring lamp, And judging it, as now it doth appear, The midnight taper of some holy man, Such as do oft in dreary wilds like this Hold their abode, I ventured onwards. Old man (offering him bread and dried fruits). Perhaps thou'rt hungry. Ray. I thank you gratefully. Old man. There is no need. Fall to, if thou hast any mind to it. Ray. I thank you truly, but I am not hungry. Old man. Perhaps thou'rt dainty: I've nought else to give thee. Ray. I should despise myself, if any food Could bear such value in my estimation, As that it should to me a straw's worth seem, To feed on homeliest, or on richest fare. Old man. So much the better. [They sit down. Ray. If I may guess from all I see around me, The luxuries and follies of the world Have long been banish'd here. [Old man looks sternly at Rayner, who looks fixedly upon him again, and both remain for some time silent. Old man. Why lookst thou so? What is there in my face that thou wouldst scan? I'm old and live alone: what wouldst thou know? Ray. I crave your pardon, and repress all wishes That may disturb you. Old man. The night wears on, let us both go to rest. Ray. I thank you, for in truth I'm very tired. Old man (pointing to his couch). There is thy place. Ray. Nay, I am young; the ground shall be my couch. I will not take your bed. [Old man then gives Rayner a cloak, which he wraps about him, laying himself down in a corner of the cave. The storm now heard at a distance. After walking up and down for some time, the old man goes close up to Rayner, who appears asleep, and looks earnestly upon him; Rayner, openign his eyes, seems surprised. Old man. Be not afraid, I will not cut thy throat. Ray. (starting half up from the ground). Nay, heaven such deed forefend! I fear thee not. I can defend myself. [Grasping his sword. Old man. Be not offended; but methought thy looks Did seem as though thou wert afraid of me. Rest thou in peaceârest thou in peace, young man: I would not do thee harm for many worlds. Rayner goes to rest again, still keeping his drawn sword in his hand. The old man goes to rest likewise, but shortly after starts from his couch in great agitation. Old man. It is mine hour of horror: 'tis upon me! I hear th' approaching sound of feet unearthly: I feel the pent-up vapour's chilly breath Burst from the yawning vault:âIt is at hand. [Turning towards the door as if he saw some one enter. Ha! com'st thou still in white and sheeted weeds, With hand thus pointing to thy bloody side? Thy grave is deep enough in hallow'd ground! Why com'st thou ever on my midnight rest? What dost thou want? If thou hast power, as seeming, Stretch forth thine arm and take my life; then free From fleshy fears, in nature as thyself, I'll follow thee to hell, and there abide The searing flames: but here, upon this earth, Is placed between the living and the dead An awful mystery of separation, Which makes their meeting frightful and unhallow'd. [In the vehemence of his agitation he throws out his arm, and strikes it against Rayner, who, alarmed at his ravings, has left his resting-place, and stolen softly behind him. Ha! what art thou? [Starting, and turning round to Rayner. Ray. Nay, thou with bristling locks, loose knocking joints And fixed eyeballs starting in their sockets, Who speakst thus wildly to the vacant space, Say rather, what art thou? Old man. I am a murderer. [Rayner starts back from him, and drops his sword. Ah! wherefore dost thou stare so strangely on me? There's no blood on me now! 'tis long since past. Hast thou thyself no crime, that thus from me Thou dost in horror shrink? Ray. Most miserable man! Old man. Thou truly sayst, for I am miserable. Ray. And what am I? [After a disturbed pause. The storm did rage and bellow through the air, And the red lightning shiver'd: No traveller would venture on his way In such a night.âO, blessed, blessed storm! For yet it hath not been, and shall be never. Most Great and Merciful! saved from this gulf, May I to thee look up?âNo: in the dustâ [As he bows himself to the earth, and is about to kneel, the report of fire-arms is heard without, and he starts up again. 'Tis done!âO, it is done!âthe horrible act! [Exit, beating his forehead violently. Old man. What may this be? Some band of nightly robbers Is near my cave, committing violent deeds. Thy light, weak flame, shall not again betray me, And lure unwelcome visitors. [Puts out the lamp; and, after a dark pause, enter Count Zaterloo, supporting himself an first gentleman, who bears a dark lantern, which he sets down on the ground, and fastens the door of the cave carefully behind them. Zat. I am wounded grievously: who would have thought Of such a powerful guard of armed men Attending on his journey. He is slain: Didst thou not see him fall? 1st gent. Yes; we have kill'd our bird, but lost the eggs. Fortune has play'd us false, yet we've escaped: Here we may rest; this cave is tenanted With some lone being whom we may control, And take possessionâ [Discovering old man. Something living here! What art thou? Old man. I am a thing no better than yourselves. 1st gent. The better then for thee that thou art so. Zat. Conduct me onward: I perceive an opening Which leads, I guess, to some more close recess: Lay me down there, for I am very faint. 1st gent. I will obey thee,âCome thou too, old man; Not from my sight one moment must thou budge. Come on; for, mark me well, shouldst thou betray us, Though fetter'd down with chains in grated dungeons, Our arms were long enough to reach to thee. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Another part of the wood. At a distance, on the background, are discovered two men watching a dead body by the light of a torch stuck between the boughs of a tree: the stage otherwisc perfectly dark. Enter Gobus on the front of the stage. Gobus. I fear they will all escape from us amongst these 'tangled paths and vile perplexing thickets. A man cannot get on half a dozen paces here but some cursed clawing thing catches hold of him, and when he turns round to collar his enemy, with a good hearty curse in his mouth, it is nothing but a thorn-bush or a briar after all. A plague upon't! I'll run no more after them if they should never be taken. â Who's there? Enter a Companion. Com What, are you here, Gobus? I thought you had been in search of the robbers. Gobus So I was; but what does it signify? they have all got the start of us now, and we can scarcely expect they will have the civility to wait till we come up with them. Com. Ay, ay, Gobus, that is a lazy man's argument. Why, there was one of them seen by Bertram not five minutes since, with his head uncovered, stalking strangely amongst the trees like a madman, and he vows he will follow the scent through every path of the wood but he will have him, either alive or dead. Gobus. But if he be a young stout robber, he may knock Bertram on the head in the mean time, and relieve him from the obligation of keeping his vow. Com. Never fear that: his bugle-horn is by his side, and as soon as he comes up with him he will give his companions notice, and they will run to his assistance. Gobus. Well, well, let them manage it the best way they can, and let us join our friends yonder, who keep watch by the body; there is good store of dried sticks in that corner, we may make a fire, and warm ourselves till they return. [Horn heard without. Com. Ha! there is the signal, and close at hand too. He has caught his man and wants assistance; let us run to him, or the villain will escape. [Exeunt companion and Gobus, who follows rather unwillingly, whilst the men who were watching the body run eagerly to the front of the stage. 1st man. It sounded to the right hand of us; let us strike into this path. [Horn sounds again. 2d man. Ay, there it sounds again; it is to this hand of us, but it is so dark, there is no finding our way. 1st man. We have been so long by the torch-light that the darkness is darker to us: run back and fetch the light with thee. [Several other attendants from different parts of the wood run across the stage, calling to one another with great eagerness, whilst the 2d man, running back again to the bottom of the stage, snatches the torch from the tree, and comes forward with it. Enter Bertram, Gobus, and others, with Rayner as their prisoner. Gobus (speaking as they enter). Here is light! here is light, friends! bring him near it, I pray you, that we may see what kind of a fish we have caught in our net. Ay, just as I said now, as hanged a looking villain as ever scowled through the grates of a dungeon. See what a wild murderous look he has with his eyes! this is the very man that did the deed, I warrant ye. Let us pull the cords faster round his arms though: if he get one of his mischievous hands loose again, there is no knowing which of our brains he may knock out first. 1st man. It will never be thine, I am sure, thou'rt always safe when the knocking out of brains is going on. Gobus. As I'm a sinner he'll get one of his hands loose if we do not take care of him. (Attempting to tighten the cords round Rayner's arms.) Ber. (putting him away with indignation). For shame, man, he is bound tight enough; I will not suffer thee to lay a finger upon him; and as for the hanged face thou talkst of, alack a-day! it goes to my heart to see him, such a goodly-looking gentleman, for such I'll be sworn he is. Gobus. Ay, no doubt! it is ever thus with thee. Thou didst never in thy life see a thief go to the gallows without crying out, âalack a-day! what a fine looking fellow it is!â Ay, and if he could but make shift to howl out half a verse of a psalm along with his father confessor, thou wert sure to notch him down upon thy holiday tables as one of the new made saints. Ay, there be no such great saints now-a-days as those who pass, with the help of a Dominican, through the hangman's hands to the other world; he beats your pope and your cardinals all to nothing in smuggling a sinner cleverly in by the back door to heaven. Ber. So much the better for thee; it is the only chance thou hast of ever getting there.âStand off, I say (pushing Gobus away), and do not stare thus upon the prisoner! art thou not ashamed to stare in an unhappy man's face after this fashion? we don't know what hard fate may have brought him into these circumstances. (To the attendants.) Move on: we are losing time here. Gobus. What, will you not pinion him more closely? Ber. No, beast! I would rather flay the skin off that fool's back of thine than gall a hair's breadth of his body. (In a softened voice to Rayner.) Speak, sir, if the rope hurts your arms; we will not use you cruelly. Ray. What didst thou say to me? was there kindness in thy voice? Ber. Yes, sir, there was kindness in it. Do the ropes hurt your arms? if they do we will loosen them a little. Ray. I wist not that my arms were bound: but if thou hast any kindness in thee, give me a drink of water when thou canst get it, for my mouth is very parched. Ber. Yes, sir, that you shall not want, though I should pay gold for it.âMove on, comrades: the night is far advanced, and we must guard the prisoner and the dead body of our master back to the city before the morning break. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. A spacious court with a magnificent building in front; a great concourse of people are discovered as if waiting in expectation of some sight. 1st crowd. The court is marvellously long of breaking up; I'm tired of waiting; and yet I don't like to lose the sight, after having stayed so long for it. 2d crowd. I fear it will go hard with the young man. 3d crowd. I fear it will, poor gentleman! Woman crowd. Ah! poor young man! it is an awful end. 2d crowd. Ay, I remember well the last criminal that was condemned here; a strong-built man he was, though somewhat up in years. O, how pale he looked as they led him out from court! I think I stood upon this very spot as he passed by me; and the fixed strong look of his features tooâit was a piteous sight! 3d crowd. Ah, man! but that was nothing to the execution. I paid half a dollar for a place near the scaffold; and it would have made any body's heart drop blood to have seen him when he lifted up the handkerchief from his eyes, and took his last look of the day-light, and all the living creatures about him. 2d crowd. Ay, man, that a human creature should be thus thrust out of the world by human creatures like himself; it is a piteous thing? Enter a man from the court. Omnes (eagerly). What news? what news of the prisoner? Man. He has just finished his defence, in which he has acquitted himself so nobly, setting off his words too with such a manly grace, that it is thought by every body he will be set free. 2d crowd. Indeed! I should not have expected this now; spoke so nobly, sayst thou? 1st crowd. Yes, yes, noble blood makes noble speaking. Woman crowd. Well, and is it not best so? poor young man! I'm sure I'm glad of it. 1st crowd. And aint I so too, milk-faced doll! though I hate to be kept so long staring for nothing. I wonder what brought me here in a murrain to it! 2d woman. La! then we sha'n't see him pass by with the chains upon his legs. 1st crowd. No, no! nor nothing at all. Come, let me pass, I have been too long here. (Pressing through the crowd to get out.) Woman crowd. O, you tread upon my toes! 1st crowd. Devil take you and your toes both! can't you keep them out of people's way then? Woman crowd. Plague take it! what had we all to do to come here like so many fools! Enter a second man from the court. 2d crowd. Here comes another man from the court. (Calling to the man.) Ho, friend! is he acquitted yet? 2d man. No, nor like to be; the judge is just about to pronounce sentence upon him, but something came so cold over my heart, I could not stay to hear it. [Several of the mob climb eagerly up upon the walls of the building, and look in at the uindows. Crowd (below). What do you see there, sirs? Crowd (above). The judge is just risen from his seat, and the black signal is lifted up. Omnes. Hush! hush! and let us listen! [A deep parst. Crowd (above). Sentence is passed now. Crowd (below). God have mercy on him! 3d crowd. I would not wear my head upon his shoulders for all the prince's coffers. 1st crowd. Alas! poor man! he is but a youth. 2d crowd. Yet he must be cut off in the flower of his days. 1st crowd. It is an awful thing! Woman crowd. Ah! but a youth, and a goodly-looking youth too, I warrant ye. 2d woman. Alack a-day! many a one falls into crimes, but all do not pay the forfeit. 3d crowd. Ha! who comes this way so fair and so gentle in her mien; thus toss'd and 'tanglel amidst the pressing crowd, like a stalk of will flower in a bed of nettles? Come, clear the way there, and let the lady pass. Enter Elizabeth, attended by Richard, the crowd making way for her. Eliz. I'm much obliged to you. Richard. We thank you, good sirs! My mistress and I are both strangers in this town, and the nearest way to your best inn, as we are told, is through this court; but the crowd is so great I think we had better turn back again. Eliz. What is the meaning of this eager multitude, So gather'd round the entry to this palace? 3d crowd. It is no palace, madam, but a public court: there is a gentleman of noble birth who is just now condemned to death for murder, and we are waiting to see him led forth from his trial; you had better stop a little while and see the sight too. Eliz. O, no! I'm come here in an evil hour!â A gentleman of noble birthâAlas! but that the crime is murder, 'twere most piteous. Omnes (eagerly). There he comes! see, see! there he comes! Enter Rayner, fettered and guarded, from the court, followed by Bertram and others, and advances slowly towards the front of the stage, the crowd opening and making a lane for him on every side. 1st crowd. What a noble gait he has even in his shackles! 2d crowd. Oh! oh! that such a man should come to this! Eliz. (after gazing eagerly at the distant prisoner). Merciful heaven! the form has strong resemblance. Rich. Sweet mistress, be not terrified with forms; 'Tis but a distant form. Eliz. Ha! then it strikes thee too!âMerciful God! Rich. Patience, dear madam! now as he advances, We shall be certified of the deception. Rayner is not so tall as this young man, Nor of a make so slender; no, nor yetâ Eliz. Peace, peace! for he advances. [Watching the prisoner as he advances with a countenance of distracted eagerness, till he comes near her; then, uttering a loud shriek, falls down, and is supported by Richard and several of the crowd. Offi. (conducting Rayner). What fainting maid is this obstructs the way? Let not the crowd so closely press around her. Open the way, and let the pris'ner pass. Ray. (upon the crowd opening and discovering Elizabeth). O, sight of misery! my Elizabeth! The last and fellest stroke of angry heav'n Falls on this cursed head. Offi. What may this mean? let us pass on: we stop not, Whate'er betide. Ray. Nay, but you do: for here there is a power Stronger than law or judgment. Give me way: It is permitted me by ev'ry sense Of human sympathy, were I e'en bound With chains tenfold enlock'd. [Bending over Elizabeth. Thou loveliest and thou dearest! O thou part Of my most inmost self! art thou thus stricken? Falls this stroke on thee? [Kneeling down and endeavouring to support her, but finding himself prevented by his chain. Is there not strength in the soul's agony To burst e'en bands of iron? [Trying furiously to burst his fetters, but cannot; then, with a subdued voice, Am I indeed a base condemned wretch, Cut off from ev'ry claim and tie of nature? [Turning to the officer. Thou who dost wear the law's authority, May it not be permitted for the love Of piteous charity?âShall strangers' hands Whilst I am thusâO, do not let it be! Offi. No, no! move on: it cannot be permitted. Ray. (fiercely roused). What, sayst thou so? [Turning to the crowd. Ye who surround me, too, Each with the form and countenance of a man, Say ye 'tis not permitted? To you I do stretch forth these fetter'd hands, And call you men: O, let me not miscall you! Voices from the crowd. Fie on't! unbind his hands, unbind his hands, And we will stand his sureties. Ber. (stepping forward in a supplicating posture to the officer). Do but unbind his hands a little space, And shoot me through the head if he escape. My arm secured him; be my recompense This one request. Offi. (to Bertram). Go to; thou art a brave man, but a weak one. (To the guard.) Move on: we halt no longer. Crowd. By all good saints we stand by the brave Bertram, And he shall be unshackled. [Menacingly. Offi. Soldiers, present your muskets to these madmen, And let them speak; the pris'ner halts no longer; Move on. [A tumult between the crowd and the guard, and Rayner is forced off the stage by the soldiers. 1st crowd. Shame light on such hard-hearted cruelty! 2d crowd. If there had been but six of us with arms in our hands he durst not have put this affront upon us. 3d crowd. But who looks to the lady? She is amongst strangers it seems, and has only this poor old man to take care of her. Omnes. We will take care of her then; we will take care of her: ay, and she shall be waited upon like an empress. 2d crowd. Ay, so she shall, let the cost be what it will. I am only a poor cobbler, God knows, yet I will pawn the last awl in my stall but she shall be waited upon like an empress. See! see! she begins to revive again. Eliz. (opening her eyes with a heavy sigh). Is it all vanish'd? 'twas a dreadful vision! [Looking on the crowd around her. O, no! the crowd is here stillâit is real; And he is led awayâhorrible! horrible! [Faints again, and is carried off the stage by Richard and the crowd. SCENE II. A square court, surrounded on all sides by the gloomy walls of a prison, the windows of which are narrow and grated, and the heads of one or two of the prisoners seen looking ruefully through the grates. Enter Hardibrand, and looks round him for some time without speaking. Har. Gloomy enough, gloomy enough, in faith! Ah! what a wondrous mass of dreary walls, Whose frowning sides are riv'n in narrow slips, As I have seen full oft some sea-worn cliff, Pierced with the murky holes of savage birds. Ah! here the birds within are clipt o' wing, And cannot fly away. Enter Ohio with a tankard in his hand, crossing the stage. Holla, my friend! I pray thee not so fast; Inform me, if thou canst, where I may find The keeper of the prison. Ohio. Know you what prince you speak to? saucy knave! I'll have thee scorch'd and flay'd, and piece-meal torn, If thou dost call me friend. Har. Good words at least; I meant thee no offence. I see thou hast a tankard in thy hand, And will not question thy high dignity. Softly; here's money for thee. [Giving him money. Ohio. Silver pieces! He! he! he! he! hast thou got more of them! Har. Nay, thou art greedy; answer first my question; Tell me at which of all these gloomy doors I needs must knock to find out the chief gaoler. Thou lookst like some fetch-carry to the prisoners; Dost understand me? Ohio. Ay, there's the place, go knock at yonder door. Har. (after knocking). This door is close nail'd up, and cannot open. Ohio (grinning maliciously, and pointing to another door). No, thou art wrong; it is the door hard by, With those black portals. [Hardibrand knocks at the other door. Knock a little louder. Har. (after knocking some time). A plague upon't! there is no one within. Ohio (still grinning maliciously). No, thou art wrong again: it is not there: It is that door upon the other side. [Pointing to the opposite wall. Har. What, dost thou jest with me, malicious varlet? I'll beat thee if thou tell me false again. Ohio. Negroes be very stupid, master friend. Enter the Keeper of the prison. Keeper (to Ohio). Thou canker-worm! thou black-envenom'd toad! Art thou a-playing thy malicious tricks? Get from my sight, thou pitchy viper, go! [Exit Ohio. Har. What black thing is it? it appears, methinks, Not worth thine anger. Keeper. That man, may't please you, sir, was born a prince. Har. I do not catch thy jest. Keeper. I do not jest; I speak in sober earnest; He is an Afric prince of royal line. Har. What sayst thou? that poor wretch who sneaketh yonder Upon those two black shanks? [Pointing off the stage. Keeper. Yes, even he: When but a youth, stol'n from his noble parents, He for a slave was sold, and many hardships By sea and land hath pass'd. Har. And now to be the base thing that he is! Well, well, proceed. Keeper. At last a surly master brought him here, Who, thinking him unfit for further service, As then a fest'ring wound wore hard upon him, With but a scanty sum to bury him, Left him with me. He ne'ertheless recover'd; And though full proud and sullen at the first, Tamed by the love of wine which strongly tempts him, He by degrees forgot his princely pride, And has been long establish'd in these walls To carry liquor for the prisoners. But such a cursed, spite-envenom'd toad!â Har. Out on't! thou'st told a tale that wrings my heart. Of royal line; born to command, and dignified By sufferings and dangers past, which make The meanest man ennobled: yet behold him; [Pointing off the stage. How by the wall he sidelong straddles on With his base tankard!âO, the sneaking varlet! It makes me weep to hear his piteous tale, Yet my blood boils to run and cudgel him. But let us on our way. Keeper. You are a noble stranger, as I guess, And wish to be conducted through the prison. It is an ancient building of great strength, And many strangers visit it. Har. It is indeed a place of ancient note. Have you at present many criminals Within these walls? Keeper. Our number is, thank God! respectable, Though not what it has been in better days. Har. In better days!âWell, do thou lead the way. [As they are about to go off the stage, they are stopped by a voice singing from one of the highest windows. SONG. Sweetly dawns the early day, Rise, my love, and come away: Leave thy grim and grated tower, Bounding walls, and step-dame's lower; Don thy weeds and come with me, Light and happy are the free. No fair mansion hails me lord, Dainties smoke not on my board; Yet full careless by my side Shalt thou range the forest wide; Though finer far the rich may be, Light and happy are the free. Har. Alas, poor soul! I would that thou wert free! What weary thrall is this that sings so sweetly? Keeper. A restless, daring outlaw; A fellow who hath awed the country round, And levied contributions like a king, To feast his jolly mates in wood and wild; Yea, been the very arbiter of fortune, And as his freakish humours bit, hath lifted At one broad sweep the churl's saved store to leave it In the poor lab'rer's cot, whose hard-worn palm Had never chuck'd a ducat 'gainst its fellow. Har. 'Tis a brave heart! has he been long confined? But list! he sings again. SONG. Light on the hanging bough we'll swing, Or range the thicket cool, Or sit upon the bank and sing Or bathe us in the pool. Har. Poor pent up wretch! thy sou roves far from home. SONG. Well, good-man time, or blunt or keen, Move thee slow or take thy leisure, Longest day will bring its e'en, Weary lives but run a measure. Har. 'Tis even so, brave heart, or blunt or keen, Thy measure has its stint. Enter Bertram from one of the doors of the prison. I think thou hast the air of an old soldier: [To Bertram as he is burrying past him. Such, without greeting, never pass me by. Ha, Bertram! is it thou? Ber. What, mine old general? Har. Yes, and mine old soldier. How dost thou, man? how has it fared with thee Since thou hast left the service? Ber. I thank your honour; much as others find it; I have no cause to grumble at my lot. Har. 'Tis well, but what's the matter with thee now? Thine eyes are red with weeping, and thy face Looks ruefully. Ber. I've been to visit, here, a noble youth, Who is condemn'd to die. Har. A noble youth! Ber. Yea, a soldier too. Har. A soldier! Ber. Ay, your honour, and the son Of a most gallant soldier. Har. But he is innocent? Ber. He is condemn'd. Har. Shame on it! were he twenty times condemn'd, He's innocent as are these silver'd locks. [Laying his hand vehemently on his head. What is his name? Ber. Rayner. Har. Ha! son to my old comrade, Rayner! Out on the fools! I would as soon believe That this right hand of mine had pilfer'd gold As Rayner's son had done a deed of shame. Come, lead me back with thee, for I must see him. Ber. Heav'n bless your honour! O, if by your means He might have grace! Har. Come, let us go to him. Ber. Not now, an' please you: he is now engaged With one most dear to him. But an hour hence I will conduct you to his cell. Har. So be it! Mean time, stay thou with me, and tell me more Of this unhappy youth: I have a mind, With the good keeper's leave, to view the prison. [Exeunt. Enter Mira and Alice by opposite sides, both muffled up in cloaks and their faces concealed. Mira (stopping Alice). Nay, glide not past me thus with muffled face: 'Tis I, a visitor to these grim walls, On the same errand with thyself. How goes it With our enthralled colleague? doth he promise Silence to keep in that which touches us Of this transaction, for the which he's bound? Alice. He is but half persuaded; go thyself And use thy artsâhush, here's a stranger near us. [Enter a man who gives a letter mysteriously to Mira, and upon her making a sign to him, retires to the bottom of the stage whilst she reads it. What readst thou there, I pray thee, that thy brows Knit thus ungraciously at ev'ry line? Mira. Knowst thou that I must doff my silken robes, Despoil my hair of its fair ornaments, And clothe me in a gown of palmer's grey, With clouted shoon and pilgrim's staff in hand To bear me o'er rude glens and dreary wastes To share a stony couch and empty board, All for the proving of my right true love For one in great distress. Ha! ha! ha! ha! So doth this letter modestly request: I pray thee read it. Alice (reading the letter). âA deadly wound rankles in my side, and I have no skilful hand to dress it, and no kind friend to comfort me. I am laid upon the cold earth, and feel many wants I never knew before. If thou hast any love for me, and as thou hast often wished to prove that love, come to me quickly: but conceal thyself in the coarse weeds of a pilgrim; my life is a forfeit to the law if any one should discover where I am. A friend in disguise will give into thy hands this letter, and conduct thee to thy miserable Zaterloo.â (Returning the letter.) And what sayst thou to this? Mira. I have, in truth, upon my hands already Troubles enough; this is, thou knowst, no time To take upon me ruin'd men's distresses. Alice. But 'tis thyself hast brought this ruin on him: 'Twas thy extravagance. Mira. Thou art a fool! His life's a forfeit to the law: 'tis time, Good time, in faith! I should have done with him. Why dost thou bend these frowning looks on me? How many in my place would for the recompense Betray him to the officers of justice! But I, thou knowst right well, detest all baseness, Therefore I will not. Alice. Hush, hush! thou speakst too loud: Some one approaches. Enter Countess Zaterloo. Countess (to Mira). I pray you, madam, pardon this intrusion; Tracing your steps, I have made bold to follow you. I am the mother of an only son, Whom for these many days I have not seen: I know right well nought is conceal'd from you Of what concerns him; let me know, I pray you, Where I may find my child. Mira. Madam, you speak to one who in his secrets Has small concern. Countess. Nay, now, I pray you, do not keep it from me: I come not with a parent's stern rebuke: O tell me where he is, for love of grace: But, if you will not, say if he is sick, Or if he is distress'd with any want. Tell, for love's sake! I have no child but him. Mira (giving her the letter). There, madam; this is all I know of him. 'Twas yonder stranger gave it to my hand; [Pointing to the man. We need not interrupt you with our presence; And so good day. [Exeunt Mira and Alice. Countess (after reading the letter). Alas, my son! and art thou low and wounded? Stretch'd on the cold ground of thy hiding place In want and fear? Oh art thou come to this? Thou who didst smile in thy fair op'ning morn, As cherubs smile who point the way to heaven. And wouldst thou have a stranger come to thee? Alas! alas! where can thy aching head So softly rest as on a parent's lap? Yes, I will wrap me in the pilgrim's weeds, Nor storm nor rugged wild shall bar my way. And though declining years impair my strength, These arms shall yet support thy feeble frame, When fairer friends desert thee. (To the messenger, beckoning him to come forward.) Good friend, this is no place to question thee! Come with me to my home. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. The inside of the prison. Rayner and Elizabeth are discovered sitting sorrowfully by one another in earnest discourse. Ray. Thou sayest well, my sweet Elizabeth; In this I have against thy love offended. But in the brightness of fair days, in all The careless gaiety of unruffled youth, Smiling like others of thy sex, I loved thee; Nor knew that thou wert also form'd to strive With the braced firmness of unyielding virtue In the dark storms of lifeâalike to flourish In sunshine or in shade.âAlas! alas! It was the thoughts of seeing theeâbut cease! The die is cast; I'll speak of it no more: The gleam which shows to me thy wondrous excellence Glares also on the dark and lowering path That must our way divide. Eliz. O no! as are our hearts, one is our way, And cannot be divided. Strong affection Contends with all things, and o'ercometh all things. I will unto thee cling with strength so terrible, That human hands the hold will ne'er unlock. Ray. Alas, my love! these are thy words of woe, And have no meaning but to speak thy woe: Dark fate hangs o'er us, and we needs must part. The strong affection that o'ercometh all things, Shall fight for us indeed, and shall o'ercome: But in a better world the vantage lies Which it shall gain for us; here, from this earth We must take different roads and climb to it, As in some pitiless storm two 'nighted travellers Lose on a wild'ring heath their 'tangled way, And meet again. Eliz. Ay, but thy way, thy way, my gentle Raynerâ It is a terrible one. Oh flesh and blood shrinks from the horrid pass! Death comes to thee, not as he visiteth The sick man's bed, pillow'd with weeping friends: O no! nor yet as on the battle's field He meets the blood-warm'd soldier in his mail, Greeting him proudly.âThou must bend thy neck, This neck round which mine arms now circled close Do feel the loving warmth of youthful life: Thou must beneath the strokeâO horrid! horrid! Ray. (supporting her from sinking to the ground). My dear Elizabeth, my most beloved! Thou art affrighted with a horrid picture By thine own fancy traced; look not upon it: All is not dreadful in the actual proof Which on th' approach frowns darkly. Rouse thy spirit; And be not unto me at this dark push My heaviest let; thou who shouldst be my stay. [She groans heavily. What means that heavy groan? I'll speak its meaning, And say, that thou to nature's weakness hast The tribute paid, and now wilt rouse thyself To meet with noble firmness what perforce Must be; and to a lorn and luckless man, Who holds in this wide world but thee alone, Prove a firm, gen'rous, and heart-buoyant mate, In the dark hour. Do I not speak it rightly? Eliz. Thou dost, thou dost! if nature's weakness in me Would yield to the heart's will. [Falling on his neck in a burst of sorrow. Enter Father Mardonio. Mar. My children, ye have been in woful conference Too long: chide not my zeal that hither brings me To break upon it. On you both be shed Heav'n's pitying mercy! Ray. Amen, good father! thou dost call us children With a most piteous and kindly voice: Here is a daughter who in this bad world Will yet remain to want a father's care; Thus let me form a tie which shall be sacred; [Putting Elizabeth's hand into Mardonio's. She has no parent. Enter Keeper of the prison. What brings thee here? We would be left in peace. Keeper (to Rayner). I am by a right noble stranger urged, Who says he has in many a rough campaign Served with your valiant father in the wars, To let him have admittance to your presence. Bertram conducts him hither. Ray. Served with mine honour'd father! and thus circumstanced, Now comes to see his son! Well, be it so: This is no time for pride to wince and rear, And turn its back upon the patt'ring hail, Bearing the thunder's shock. Let it e'en be: Admit him instantly. [Calling him back. Nay, ere thou goest, What is he call'd? Keeper. The Gen'ral Hardibrand. Ray. An honour'd name. [Exit Keeper. (To Elizabeth.) Retire, my love: I cannot bear to have thy woes exposed Before a stranger's gaze. [She retires with Mardonio to an obscure part of the prison at the bottom of the stage. Enter Hardibrand and Bertram. Har. (to Bertram: stopping short as he enters, and gazing upon Rayner, who is turned away from them, and looking after Elizabeth). It is the son of Rayner: in his form And face, though thus half turn'd from us, I see His father. Still a soldier and a gentleman In ev'ry plight he seem'd. A clown or child Had sworn him such clad in a woollen rug. [Advancing to Rayner. Young soldier, I did know your gallant father; Regard me not as an intruding stranger. Ray. I thank you, courteous sir: in other days Such greeting to my heart had been most welcome. A gallant father and condemned son May in the letter'd registers of kindred Alliance have; but in the mind's pure record, They no relation bear: let your brave friend Still be to you as one who had no son. Har. No, boy; that sentiment bespeaks thy blood. Heed not those fetter'd hands: look in my face, Look in my face with the full confidence Of a brave man; for such I'll swear thou art. Thinkst thou that I am come to visit thee In whining pity as a guilty man? No, by the rood! if I had thought thee such, Being the son of him whose form thou wearst, I should have cursed thee. Thou by mis'ry press'd, Hast strongly tempted been, I know thy story: Bertram has told it me: and spite of courts, And black-robed judges, laws, and learn'd decisions, I do believe it as I do my creed. Shame on them! Is all favour and respect For brave and noble blood forgotten quite? Ray. Ah, do not fear! they will remember that, And nail some sable trappings to my coffin. Har. I would that to their grave and pompous chairs Their asses' ears were nail'd! Think they that men, Brave men, for thou thyselfâWhat corps, I pray thee, Didst thou belong to in thy prince's service? Ray. The first division of his fourth brigade Was that in which I served. Har. Thou hast companion been to no mean men. Those six brave officers of that division, Upon the famed redoubt, in his last siege, Who did in front o' th' en'my's fiercest fire Their daring lodgement make, must needs of course Be known to thee. Ray. I knew them well; five of them were my friends. Har. And not the sixth? Ray. He was, alas! my greatest enemy; To him I owe these bonds. Har. A curse light on his head, brave though he be! Ray. O curse him not, for woes enough already Rest on his wretched head. [Bowing low, and putting his hand on his head. Har. Ha! thou thyself,âthou wast thyself the sixth! Thank heav'n for this! Then let them if they will Upon a thousand scaffolds take thy life, And spike thy head a thousand feet aloft; Still will I say thy father had a son. [Rushing into his arms. Come to my soldier's heart, thou noble bird Of a brave nest!âmust thou indeed be pluck'd And cast to kites? By heav'n thou shalt not die! Shall such a man, as thou art, from his post Be shamed and push'd for one rash desp'rate act? It shall not be, my child! it shall not be! Ray. (smiling). In faith, good gen'ral, could your zeal prevent it, I am not yet so tired of this bad world, But I could well submit me to the change. Har. I'll with all speed unto the governor, Nor be discouraged, though he loudly prate That grace and pardon will but leave at liberty The perpetrators of such lawless deeds To do the like again, with such poor cant. [Elizabeth, who has been behind backs, listening eagerly to their conversation, and stealing nearer to them by degrees in her eagerness to hear it, now rushes forward, and throws herself at Hardibrand's feet. Eliz. We ask not liberty; we ask but life. O grant us this, and keep us where they will, Or as they will. We shall do no disquiet. O let them grant us life, and we will bless them! Ray. And wouldst thou have me live, Elizabeth, Forlorn and sad, in loathly dungeon pent, Kept from the very use of mine own limbs, A poor, lost, caged thing? Eliz. Would not I live with thee? would not I cheer thee? Wouldst thou be lonely then? wouldst thou be sad? I'd clear away the dark unwholesome air, And make a little parlour of thy cell: With cheerful labour eke our little means, And go abroad at times to fetch thee in The news and passing stories of the day. I'd read thee books: I'd sit and sing to thee: And every thing would to our willing minds Some observation bring to cheer our hours. Yea, e'en the varied voices of the wind O' winter nights would be a play to us. Nay, turn not from me thus, my gentle Rayner! How many suffer the extremes of pain, Ay, lop their limbs away, in lowest plight Few years to spend upon a weary couch With scarce a friend their sickly draughts to mingle! And dost thou grudge to spend thy life with me? Ray. I could live with thee in a pitchy mine; In the cleft crevice of a savage den, Where coils the snake, and bats and owlets roost, And cheerful light of day no entrance finds. But wouldst thou have me live degraded also; Humbled and low? No, liberty or nought Must be our boon. Har. And thou shalt have it too, my noble youth: Thou hast upon thy side a better advocate Than these grey hairs of mine. (To Elizabeth.) Bless that fair face! it was not made for nothing. We'll have our boon; such as befits us too. No, hang them if we stoop to halving it! [Taking her eagerly by the hand. Come with me quickly; let us lose no time: Angel from heaven thou art, and with heav'n's power Thou'lt plead and wilt prevail. Ray. In truth thou wilt expose thyself, my love, And draw some new misfortune on thy head. [Endeavouring to draw her away from Hardibrand. Eliz. (to Hardibrand). What new misfortune? can they kill thee twice? We're tardy: O move quickly! lose no time! Har. Yes, come, and Bertram here will guide our way: His heart is in the cause. Ber. Yes, heart and soul, my gen'ral. Would my zeal Could now make some amends for what those hands Against him have unwittingly committed. O that the fellest pains had shrunk their nerves Ere I had seized upon him! Ray. Cease, good Bertram! Cease to upbraid thyself. Thou didst thy duty Like a brave man, and thou art in my mind: Not he who seized, but he whose gen'rous pity Did, in my fallen state, first show me kindness. [Bertram kisses his hand. Go go! they wait for thee. Ber. They shall not wait. Would that we were return'd, Bearing good tidings! Har. O fear it not, my heart says that we shall. [Exeunt Elizabeth, Hardibrand, and Bertram. Manent Rayner and Mardonio. Mar. Hope oft, my son, unbraces the girt mind, And to the conflict turns it loosely forth, Weak and divided. I'm disturb'd for thee. Ray. I thank thee, father, but the crime of blood Your governor hath ne'er yet pardon'd; therefore Be not disturb'd for me; my hopes are small. Mar. So much the better. Now to pious thoughts We will directâWho comes to interrupt us? Enter the Turnkey. Ray. It is the turnkey; a poor man who, though His state in life favours not the kind growth Of soft affections, has shown kindness to me. He wears upon his face the awkwardness And hesitating look of one who comes To ask some favour; send him not away. (To turnkey.) What dost thou want, good friend? out with it, man! We are not very stern. Turnkey. Please you, it has to me long been a priv'lege To show the curious peasantry and boors, Who from the country flock o' holy days, Through his strait prison bars, the famous robber, That overhead is cell'd; and now a company Waits here without to see him, but he's sullen And will not show himself. If it might please you But for a moment opposite your grate To stand, without great wrong to any one, You might pass for him, and do me great kindness. Or the good father there, if he be willing To doff his cowl and turn him to the light, He hath a good thick beard, and a stern eye, That would be better still. Ray. (laughing). Ha! ha! ha! what say ye to it, father? [Laughing again more violently than at first. Mar. (turning out the turnkey in a passion, and returning sternly to Rayner). What means this wild and most unnatural mirth; This lightness of the soul, strange and unsuited To thy unhappy state? it shocks me much. Approaching death brings nought to scare the good, Yet has it wherewithal to awe the boldest: And there are seasons when the lightest soul Is call'd on to look inward on itself In awful seriousness. Ray. Thou dost me wrong; indeed thou dost me wrong. I laugh'd, but, faith! I am not light of soul: And he who most misfortune's scourge hath felt Will tell thee laughter is the child of mis'ry. Ere sin brought wretchedness into the world, The soberness of undisturbed bliss Held even empire o'er the minds of men, Like steady sunshine of a cloudless sky. But when it came, then came the roaring storm, Lowering and dark; wild, changeful, and perturb'd; Whilst through the rent clouds ofttimes shot the gleam More bright and powerful for the gloom around it. E'en 'midst the savage strife of warring passions, Distorted and fantastic, laughter came, Hasty and keen, like wild-fire in the night; And wretches learnt to catch the fitful thought That swells with antic and uneasy mirth The hollow care-lined cheek. I pray thee pardon! I am not light of soul. Death is to me an awful thing; nay, father, I fear to die. And were it in my power, By suffering of the keenest racking pains, To keep upon me still these weeds of nature, I could such things endure, that thou wouldst marvel, And cross thyself to see such coward-bravery. For oh! it goes against the mind of man To be turn'd out from its warm wonted home, Ere yet one rent admits the winter's chill. Mar. Come to my breast, my son! thou hast subdued me. [Embracing him. And now we will lift up our thoughts to Him Who hath in mercy saved thy hands from blood. Ray. Yes, in great mercy, for the which I'd bow In truer thankfulness, my good Mardonio, E'en with these fears of nature on my mind, Than for the blessing of my spared life, Were it now proffer'd me. [They retire into the obscurity of the dungeon, at the bottom of the stage, and the scene closes on them. SCENE II. A small apartment in a solitary cottage in the country. Enter Count Zaterloo, supported by an attendant, and followed by the Countess in the disguise of a pilgrim; both of them wearing masks. She places a pillow for his head on a couch or sickchair, and he is placed upon it, apparently with pain. Countess (to attendant). There, set him gently down; this will support him. (To Count Zaterloo.) How art thou now? I fear thou'rt very faint After so long a journey. (To attendant.) We have no farther need of thine assistance: Thou wilt retire, but be upon the watch. [Exit attendant. Zat. (unmasking). Now, charming Mira, lay disguise aside; Speak thine own natural voice, and be thyself: There is no eye to look upon us now; No more excuse for this mysteriousness. Let me now look upon thy face and bless it! Thou hast done well by me: thou'rt wondrous gentle. I knew thee fair and charming, but I knew not Thou wast of such a soft and kindly nature. [The countess unmasks and looks at him sorrowfully. Ha, mother! is it you? Countess. Who should it be? where shouldst thou look for kindness? When we are sick, where can we turn for suecour; When we are wretched, where can we complain; And when the world looks cold and surly on us, Where can we go to meet a warmer eye With such sure confidence as to a mother? The world may scowl, acquaintance may forsake, Friends may neglect, and lovers know a change, But when a mother doth forsake her child, Men lift their hands and cry, âa prodigy!â Zat. (taking hold of both her hands and kissing them.) O mother! I have been a thankless child! I've given thee hoary hairs before thy time; And added weight to thy declining years, Who should have been their stay. Countess. Be calm, my son, for I do not upbraid thee. Zat. Wretch that I am! I was an only son, And therefore bound by no divided tie To be to thee thy hold and thy support. I was a widow's son, and therefore bound By every generous and manly tie To be in filial duty most devoted. O I have vilely done! I feel it now; But if I live to be a man again, I'll prove a better son to thee, dear mother. Countess. I know thou wilt, my dearest Zaterloo; And do not thus upbraid thyself too sharply; I've been a foolish mother to thy youth, But thou wilt pardon me. Zat. Of this no moreâHow came you by my letter? If you did intercept it on its way, Mira is faithful still. Countess. It was from Mira's hand that I received it. She toss'd it at me with a jeering smile When I with anxious tears inquired for thee. Zat. (rising half from his seat in great passion). O faithless, faithless woman! she it was, Who made of me the cursed thing I am! I've been a fool indeed and well requited. Base, avaricious, and ungratefulâoh! [Putting his hand on his side, as if seized with sudden pain. Countess. Such agitation suits not with thy state: What ails thee now? Zat. The pain, the pain! it has return'd again With increased violence. Countess. God send thee ease! why dost thou look so wildly, And grasp my hand so hard? What is't disturts thee? Zat. My time on earth is short. Countess. Nay, say not so: thou mayst recorer still. O why this seeming agony of mind? 'Tis not the pain that racks thee. Zat. There's blood upon my head: I am accursed. Countess. Good heaven forefend! thou wand'rest? in thy speech. Thy life I know is forfeit to the law By some unlawful act, but oh no blood! Zat. O for a short respite! but 'twill not be: I feel my time is near. Countess. Thou wand'rest much: there's something on thy mind, Dark'ning thy fancy. Zat. 'Twas I that did itâI that murder'd him: He who must suffer for it did it not. Countess. What words are these? my blood rans cold to hear them. Zat. (alarmed). Be still, be still! there's some one at the door: All round me is exposed and insecure. [Countess Zaterloo goes to the door and receives something from a servant, shutting the door immediately. Countess. It is a servant come to fetch me something. Zat. Has he not heard it? he has heard it all! [In violent alarm and agitation. Countess. Be still, be still! it is impossible. Thou'st waked the pain again; I see thee tremble. Zat. (writhing as if in great pain). Ay, this will master me: 'twill have me now: What can be done? O for a short reprieve! Countess. Alas, my child! what wouldst thou have me do? Zat. I would have time turn'd backward in its course, And what is past ne'er to have been: myself A thing that no existence ever had. Canst thou do this for me? Countess. Alas! I cannot. Zat. Then cursed be thy early mother's cares! Would thou hadst lifted up my infant form And dash'd it on the stones! I had not livedâ I had not lived to curse thee for thy pains. Countess. And dost thou curse me then? Zat. (softened). O no! I do not! I did not curse thee, mother: was it so? Countess. No, no, thou didst not: yet I have deservedâ I was a mother selfish in my fondness; And with indulgence, senseless and extreme, Blasted the goodly promise of thy youth. Zat. (rising half up alarmed from his couch). Hark! there's a noise again! hast thou more servants Coming with errands to thee?âWe're discover'd! Countess. Be not so soon alarm'd: it is impossible. Zat. Is there an inner chamber? lead me there; [Pointing to a door. I cannot rest in this. [Stopping short eagerly as she is leading him out with great difficulty. âThine absence haply From thine own house, suspicion may create: Return to it again, and through the day Live there as thou art wont; by fall of eve Thou'lt come to me again.âI'm very weak; I must lean hard upon thee. [Exit, looking suspiciously behind him as if he heard a noise, and supported with great difficulty by his mother. SCENE III. The Countess Zaterloo's house. Enter Countess and a female attendant. Att. Ah! wherefore, madam, are you thus disturb'd Pacing from room to room with restless change, And turning still a keen and anxious ear To every noise? What can I do for you? Countess. Cease, cease! thou canst do nothing, my good girl: I have a cause, but do not seek to know it. Enter a Servant. Serv. There is a strangerâ Countess (starting with alarm). Ha! what dost thou say? A stranger! what appearance does he wear? Is there but one? Looks he suspiciously? Serv. Be not alarmed, madam; 'tis a woman. Countess (feigning composure). Thou art a fool to think I am alarm'd: Or man or woman, whosoe'er it be, I am unwell, and must not be disturb'd. Serv. It is a lady of distinguish'd mien, Though much in grief, and she so earnestly Pleads for admittance that I am compell'dâ Pardon me, madam; but to look upon her Would move your heart to pity. Countess. Let her enter. [Exit servant. Who may this be? why do I tremble thus? In grief!âthe wretched surely will not come In guileful seeming to betray the wretched. (To attendant.) Knowst thou who this may be? Att. Indeed I do not. Countess. Retire then to a distance: here she comes: But do not leave the chamber. [Attendant retires to the bottom of the stage, and enter Elizabeth with her hair and dress disordered, like one distracted with grief. Eliz. Madam, I come a stranger to your presence, By misery embolden'd, and urged on By desperation. In your pity only Lives all the hope of my most wretched state: O kill it not! push me not to the brink Of misery so deep and terrible! Have pity! O have pity on my woe! Thou art a woman, and a woman's heart Will not be shut against a wretched woman. Countess. What wouldst thou ask? thou dost with too much grief Conceal the point and object of thy suit. Eliz. There is in prison bound, condemn'd to die, And for a crime by other hands committed, A noble youth, and my betrothed love: Your sonâO shrink not back, nor look so sternly! Your son, as secret rumour hath inform'd me, Mortally wounded and with little hope Of life, can ample testimony give, Being himself of those who did the deed, That Rayner did it not:âO let him then, In whate'er secret place he lies conceal'd, In pity let him true confession make; And we will bless himâHeav'n will pardon him! Countess. Despair hath made thee mad! art thou aware What thou dost ask of me? Go to our governors; They may have pity on thee; but from me It were an act against the sense of nature. Eliz. Nay, say not so! I have for mercy sued At the proud feet of power, and been rejected: What injury can reach a dying man? Can his few hours of breathing poise the scales 'Gainst the whole term of a man's reckon'd life In youth's best strength? Countess. Go, thou hast been deceived with a false tale: And, were it true, hope ends not but with life; Heav'n only knows who is a dying man. Eliz. For blessed charity close not your pity Against all other feelings but your own! [Clasping the countess's knees and kissing her hand. Sweet lady! gentle lady! dearest lady! O be not ruthless to a soul bow'd down In extreme wretchedness! Countess. Cease, cease! unlock thy hold: embrace me not! Has he for whom thou pleadst from out o' thyself Received his being? press'd with infant lips Thy yearning bosom? smiled upon thy knees, And bless'd thine ear with his first voice of words? Away, away! despair has made thee mad, That thus thou hangst upon me. Eliz. O he for whom I plead is to my soul Its soul: is to my fancy its bound world, In which it lives and moves; all else beyond Darkness, annihilation. O have pity! For well thou sayst, despair has made me mad. Countess. Let go, let go! thou with a tigress strivest, Defending her bay'd whelp: I have no pity. Heav'n will have pity on thee! let me go; Unlock thy desp'rate hold! [Breaks from her and runs out, and Elizabeth, quite overcome, sinks upon the ground, the attendant rushing forward from the bottom of the stage to support her. Enter Father Mardonio. Mar. (raising her). My daughter, heaven will send in its good time The aid that is appointed for thy state. Contend no more, but to its righteous will Submit thyself. Let me conduct thee hence. [Exeunt, Mardonio and attendant supporting her. Re-enter the countess, looking fearfully round her as she enters. Countess. She is gone now: thank God that she is gone! There is a horrid conflict in my mind. What shall I do? I strongly am beset. I will go quickly to some holy man, And ghostly counsel ask. [Exit, crossing the stage with a quick, irresolute step, sometimes stopping to consider, and then hurrying on again. ACT V. SCENE I. A spacious outer room in the prison. Enter an Under-Gaoler and a Clown. Clown. I pray thee now, my good friend, here is a piece of money for theeâvery good money too; thou mayst look o' both sides of it an' thou wilt: it has been wrapped up in the foot of my old holiday stockings since last Michaelmas twelvemonth, and neither sun nor wind has blown upon it. Take it, man, thou art heartily welcome to it if thou canst put me into a good place near the scaffold; or a place where I may see him upon the scaffold; for I am five-and-thirty years old next Shrove Tuesday when the time comes round, and I have never yet seen in all my born days so much as a thief set i' the stocks. Gaoler. Poor man! thou hast lived in most deplorable ignorance indeed. But stand aside a little, here is the famous executioner of Olmutz acoming, who has been sent for expressly to do the job; for our own is but a titulary hangman; he has all the honours of the office, but little experience in the duties of it. Clown. O dickens, I'll creep into a corner then, and have a good look of him. A man that has cut off men's heads, save us all! he must have a strange bloody look about him for certain. Enter two Executioners, speaking as they enter. 1st ex. What! no execution in this town for these ten years past? Lord pity you all for a set of poor devils indeed! Why, I have known a smaller town than this keep ye up a first executioner for the capital business, with a second man under him for your petty cart-tail and pillory work; ay, and keep them handsomely employed too. No execution in such a town as this for these ten years past! One might as well live amongst the savages. 2d ex. It is a pitiful thing to be sure, but don't despise us altogether, Mr. Master: we shall improve by-and-bye; and here is a fair beginning for it too, if heaven prosper us. 1st ex. Ay, thou wilt, perhaps, have the honour of hanging a thief or two before thou art the age of Methuselah; but I warrant ye, the beheading of this young nobleman here by the famous executioner of Olmutz will be remembered amongst you for generations to come. It will be the grand date from which every thing will be reckoned; ay, your very grandchildren will boast that their fathers were present at the sight. 2d ex. I make no doubt on't, my master, but you are a very capital man in your way: heaven forbid that I should envy the greatness of any one; but I would have you to know that there have been others in the world as good as yourself ere now. My own father cut off Baron Koslam's head upon this very scaffold that we now hear them hammering at. 1st ex. Some wandering hocus-pocus baron, I suppose, that sold nostrums for the toothache. I always put such fellows into the hands of my underling to operate upon; I never count the dealing with them as your prime work, though for certain we must call it your head work; ha! ha! ha! (Holding out his axe in a vain-glorious manner.) Seest thou this axe of mine? The best blood of the country has been upon its edge. To have had one's father or brother under its stroke, let me tell thee, is equal to a patent of nobility. 2d ex. Well, be it so. I envy no man, though thou art set over my head upon this occasion. I have whipped, branded, and pilloried in great meekness and humility for these seven years past; but the humble shall be exalted at last, and I shall have better work to do by-and-bye. Let us have no more contention about it.âWho's there? (Observing gaoler and clown.) Ay, gaoler, do thou go and kick up the black prince, he is snoring in some corner near us, and send him for some brandy. [Gaoler coming forward, with the clown creeping after him, half afraid. Gaoler. The black prince is nowhere to be found; he has not been seen since the cells were locked. 2d ex. Go fetch us some liquor thyself then. 1st ex. But who is this sneaking behind thee, and afraid to show his face? Gaoler. Only a poor countryman, a friend of mine, who wanted to look at you as you passed. 1st ex. Yes, yes, everybody has a curiosity to look at extraordinary persons. (To clown.) Come forward, man, and don't be afraid. Didst thou ever before see any thing better than a poor parish priest, or a scrubby lord of the village? didst thou, eh? Clown (abashed). I don't know, please you: my brother did once stand within a team's length of the Prince of Carrara, when he passed through our village on his way to Franconia. 1st ex. So then thou art not the first of thy family that has seen a great man. But don't be afraid, my good fellow, I a'n't proud nor haughty as many of them be: thou shalt even shake hands with me an' thou wilt. [Holding out his hand to clown, who shrinks from him, and puts his hands behind his back. Clown. No, I thank you; I ben't much of a hand-shaker: I have got a little sore on my thumb, may it please you: I thank you all the same as though I did. 1st ex. Ay, thou art too mannerly to call it the thing that we wot of. Well, thou art a good sort of fellow; don't be abashed: thou seest I am very condescending to thee. Come, then, thou shalt drink a cup of liquor with me. Follow us into the next ward, my good friend. Clown (shrinking from him again). O na, save your presence! I'll go with the gaoler here. 1st ex. (to 2d executioner). Ay, he is but a poor bashful clown, and don't know how to behave himself in good company. [Exeunt executioners. Clown. Shake hands with him, Mary preserve us! it sets the very ends of my fingers a-dingling. Drink out of the same mug with him, too! (sputtering with his lips) poh! poh! poh! the taste of raw heads and carrion is on my lips at the thoughts of it. (To gaoler.) Come, let us go out of this place; I be long enough here. (Stepping short as he goes off.) What noise and hammering is this we hear? Gaoler. It is the workmen putting up the scaffold. Clown (starting). What, are we so near to it? mercy on us! let me get out of this place, for it puts me into a terrible quandary. Gaoler. If this be the mettle thou art made of, thou hadst better take thy money again, and I'll give thy place for the sight to somebody that has got a stouter heart than thou hast. Clown. Na, na, I won't do that neither; I have a huge desire to see how a man looks when he is going to have his head cut off, and I'll stay for the sight, though I should swoon for it. Poor man! poor man! what frightful things there be in this world, when one's mind sets a-thinking upon it!âIs he a tall man, now (to gaoler), or a short man? a palefaced man, orâay, pale enough, I warrant. Mercy on us! I shall think of him many a night after this, before I go to sleep. Poor man! poor man! what terrible things there be in this world, if a body does but think of them. [Exeunt clown and gaoler. SCENE II. A dungeon; Rayner discovered sitting at a table by the light of a lamp, with a book in his hand; the clock from a neighbouring steeple strikes three, and he, roused by the sound, lays down the book. Ray. This bell speaks with a deep and sullen voice: The time comes on apace with silent speed. Is it indeed so late? [Looking at his watch. It is even so. [Pausing, and looking still at the watch. How soon time flies away! yet, as I watch it, Methinks, by the slow progress of this hand, I should have lived an age since yesterday, And have an age to live. Still on it creeps, Each little moment at another's heels, Till hours, days, years, and ages are made up Of such small parts as these, and men look back, Worn and bewilder'd, wond'ring how it is. Thou trav'llest like a ship in the wide ocean, Which hath no bounding shore to mark its progress, O Time! ere long I shall have done with thee. When next thou leadest on thy nightly shades, Though many a weary heart thy steps may count, Thy midnight 'larum shall not waken me. Then shall I be a thing, at thought of which The roused soul swells boundless and sublime, Or wheels in wildness of unfathom'd fears: A thought; a consciousness; unbodied spirit. Who but would shrink from this? It goes hard with thee, Social connected man; it goes hard with thee To be turn'd out into a state unknown, From all thy kind, an individual being. But wherefore shrink? came we not thus to earth? And He who sent, prepared reception for us. Ay, glorious are the things that are prepared, As we believe!âyet, heaven pardon me! I fain would skulk beneath my wonted cov'ring, Mean as it is. Ah, Time! when next thou fillst thy nightly term, Where shall I be? Fy! fy upon thee still! E'en where weak infancy, and tim'rous age, And maiden fearfulness have gone before thee; And where, as well as he of firmest soul, The meanly-minded and the coward are. Then trust thy nature, at th'approaching push, The mind doth shape itself to its own wants, And can bear all things. [Rising from his seat, and walking several times backward and forward. I know not how it is, I'm wondrous heavy; Fain would I rest awhile. This weary frame Has but a little more to do for me, And yet it asks for rest. I'll lay me down: It may be possible that I shall sleep, After these weary tossings of the mind; I feel as though I should. [Goes to sleep, covering himself with a cloak. Enter Ohio, creeping out from a hiding-place at the bottom of the stage, and going softly up to Rayner, looks for some time upon him with a malicious grin. Ohio. Thou hast loved negroes' blood, I warrant thee. Dost sleep? ay, they will waken thee ere long, And cut thy head off. They'll put thee to rest; They'll close thine eyes for thee without thy leave; They'll bloat thy white skin for thee, lily-face. Come, less harm will I do thee than thy fellows: My sides are cold: a dead man needs no cloak. [Beginning gently to pull off Rayner's cloak, who starts from his sleep, and looks at him in amazement. Ray. Ha! what hole of the earth hath cast thee up? What thing art thou? and what wouldst thou with me? Ohio. My sides are cold; a dead man needs no cloak. Ray. 'Tis true indeed, but do not strip the living. Where dost thou run to now? where wast thou hid? Ohio (after running to his hiding-place, and fetching out a stick, which he presents to Rayner). Beat me thyself, but do not tell of me. Ray. I would not harm thee for a greater fault. I'm sorry thou art cold; here is my cloak: Thou hast said well; a dead man needs it not. I know thee now; thou art the wretched negro Who serves the prisoners; I have observ'd thee: I'm sorry for thee; thou art bare enough, And winter is at hand. Ohio. Ha! art thou sorry that the negro's cold? Where wast thou born who art so pitiful? I will not take thy cloak, but I will love thee. They shall not cut thy head off. Ray. Go thy ways; Go skulk within thy hiding-place again, And, when the cell is open'd, save thyself. Ohio. They sha'n't cut off thy head. Ray. Now, pray thee go. Ohio. I'll kiss thy feet; I'll spend my blood for thee. Ray. I do beseech thee go! there's some one coming: I hear them at the door. [Pushes him hastily off. Enter Hardibrand, advancing slowly to Rayner, his eyes cast upon the ground. Ray. Good morrow, general: where's thy friendly hand? Why dost thou turn thine eyes aside, and fear To look me in the face? Is there upon it Aught that betrays the workings of the mind Too strongly mark'd? I will confess to thee I've struggled hard, I've felt the fears of nature; But yet I have the spirit of a man That will uphold me: therefore, my brave friend, Do me the grace to look upon me boldly; I'll not disgrace thee. Har. No, my valiant boy! I know thou'lt not disgrace me, nor will I Put shame on thee by wearing on this morn A weeping face: I will be valiant too. We will not, Rayner, though thou'rt thusâOh! oh! [Bursting into tears. Ray. My gen'rous friend, my second father, why Wilt thou oppress me thus? Har. Bear with me, bear with me; I meant to brave it, And I will brave it. But to thee, my son, In thy distress, encompass'd as thou art, My heart so strongly has enlink'd itself, That to part from thee, boy, isâ [Falling on his neck, and bursting again into tears. Enter Mardonio. Mar. (after looking at them for some time, and in a solemn imposing tone of voice). The strength of man sinks in the hour of trial; But there doth live a pow'r that to the battle Girdeth the weak: heaven's vivifying grace, And strength, and holy confidence be thine, Who art in mercy stricken! [Holding up his right hand to heaven, whilst Rayner, approaching with reverence, bows himself beneath it very low. Ray. Thanks to thee, father! these are words of power, And I do feel their strength. Beneath that hand, Which hath in mercy stricken me, I bow; Yea bow, the nobler and the bolder grown For such humility.â(Familiarly.) How goes the time? Does day begin to dawn? Mar. Grey light peeps faintly o'er the eastern towers. Ray. The time is then advanced; we'll husband it. Come close to me, my friends. [Taking Hardibrand and Mardonio each by the hand, and pressing them close to his breast. Of worldly cares, upon my mind there rest But only those which I have mention'd to you. Yet, in this solemn hour, let me remind you:â My poor Elizabethâ Har. (eagerly). Thou'st said enough: She is my child and heiress of my lands To the last rood.âAh! what avails it now! Ray. How shall a dying man find thanks for this, Whose day is closed? I will attempt no thanks. The other wish that closely presses on me:â Mardonio, upon thee must hang this boon:â That miserable man of whom I've told you; Now living in the hell of his remorse, Cut off from human intercourse; whose vision Of midnight horrors saved this hand from blood: I fainâ Har. (again eagerly interrupting him). Fear not! fear not! he shall be saved; And shall with human beings yet consort In blessed charity, if ghostly care From holiest men procured, or off'rings made To ev'ry sacred shrine on christian ground Can give him peace. Ray. (smiling and pressing Hardibrand to his bosom). With all the prompt and gen'rous profusion Of eager youth dost thou, mine aged friend, Take every thing upon thee. Be it so. And good Mardonio with his sober counsel Will aid thy bounty. Here I join your hands: My worldly cares are closed. Enter Elizabeth, followed by Richard and Bertram, who remain on the background whilst she comes slowly forward; Rayner turning round on hearing them enter. Ah! who is this? Alas! alas! it is Elizabeth. [Holding out his hand to her. Advance, my love; thou'rt ever welcome here. How does it fare with thee? Eliz. It is all mist and darkness with me now; I know not how it fares with me. Ray. Alas! Thou gentle soul! a dark cloud o'er thee hangs, But through the gloom the sun again will break, And, in the soberness of calm remembrance, Thou wilt look back upon misfortunes past Like tempests that are laid. Thou dost not heed me: Thou dost not speak to me. Alas! Alas! What shall I say to thee? I've loved thee well, and would have loved thee long, Had it so beenâbut thou shalt be beloved! Heav'n will take charge of thee when I'm at rest: The kindly and the good shall be thy kindred, [Putting her hand in Hardibrand's. And ev'ry sorrowful and gentle heart Shall knit itself to thee, and call thee sister. [Elizabeth makes a motion with her hand as if she would speak, and he pauses, but she is silent. What meant, my love, that motion of thy hand? Mar. She fain would speak to thee, but has no voice. Ray. I know it well, Elizabeth; no voice Needst thou to tell me how thou'st dearly loved me, And dearly do I prize it; 'tis my pride; E'en humbled as I am, it is my pride. Heav'n's dearest blessings rest upon thy head!â And now, since we must part, do in thy love, Do for me this last grace; bid me farewell, And let my earthly sorrows now be closed. Heav'n's blessing rest upon thee! [He kisses her, and she turns to go away, Rayner looking after her as she goes, but presently returns again. Ray. Thou art return'd, my soul, what wouldst thou have? Eliz. (in a broken voice). A thoughtâa wish did press upon my heart, But it is gone. Ray. I thank thee for thy wish; It is a good one, though thou canst not speak it, And it will do me good. But leave me! leave me! Thou wilt unfit me for a task of strength. [Elizabeth again attempts to go away, but still returns. Ah, wherefore still! wilt thou be cruel to me? Eliz. O, no! O, no! I know not what I do: It is all mist and darkness with me now: I look upon thee, but I see thee not. Let me once more but feel thy hand in mine And send me where ye will: my being then Is at an end. [They embrace again, and she still continues to hang upon him. Ray. (to Bertram and Richard). O, lead her hence, and have some mercy on me! My father died i' the field a valiant death, And shall his son upon the scaffold die O'ercome and weak, reft of that decent firmness Which e'en the base and vulgar there assume? O lead her hence! in mercy lead her hence! [Bertram and Richard tear her from him, and lead her away, whilst he turns his back, and hides his face with his hands. Eliz. (stopping short, and tossing up her arms distractedly as they are leading her out). Reprieve, reprieve! I hear a voice i' the air! I hear it yet again! Ray. (uncovering his face, and looking about eagerly, whilst Hardibrand rushes forward impetuously from the bottom of the stage, where he has been pacing backward and forward with hasty strides). Is't any thing? Mar. Alas, no! all is silent: 'tis the fancy Of fond distraction list'ning to itself. Har. Nay, it was something: Bertram, thou didst hear it? Ber. No, I heard nothing. Har. What, nor thou, good Richard? Rich. No, nothing. Eliz. (holding up her arm distractedly as Richard and Bertram lead her off). And is it nothing? no redemption near! [Exeunt Elizabeth, Richard, and Bertram, whilst Rayner, uttering a deep groan, hides his face, and Hardibrand returns with hasty strides to the bottom of the stage. Ray. (uncovering his face). Is she gone now? Mar. She is. Ray. Thank God for it! Now to our task: [Stepping forward with assumed firmness. What of it now remains we shall o'er-master. Pray thee how goes the time? But pardon me! I have too oft inquired how goes the time: It is my weakness. Mar. The morning now advances. Ray. So I reckon'd. We too shall put ourselves in forwardness: And so, good father, to your ghostly guidance I do commend myself. Enter Gaoler. Gaoler. The officers of justice are arrived, And wait the presence of the prisoner. Ray. They come upon us sooner than we wist; But 'tis so much the better. (To Mardonio, aside.) Shall we have time allow'd us for retirement, Before they lead me forth? Mar. 'Tis ever so allow'd. Ray. Come then, I feel me stronger than I was: 'Twill soon be past; the work goes on apace. [Taking hold of Hardibrand and Mardonio as he goes out. Your arm, I pray:âI know not how it is; My head feels dizzy, but my limbs are firm. Good Hardibrand, thinkst thou I shall disgrace thee? Har. No, by the mass! I'll give them this old carcase To hack for crow's meat if thou shrinkst one hair's breadth From the comportment of a gallant soldier, And of a brave man's son. Ray. (smiling with a gratified look). I thank thee. Methinks I tread now, as I onward move, With more elastic and dilating step, As if a spirit of pride within me stirr'd Buoying me up on the swoln billow's ridge. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An outer garden-room or portico in the house where Zaterloo is concealed. Enter Countess and a confessor, with two attendants bearing Zaterloo on a small couch, which they set down on the middle of the stage; the attendants retire. Countess. The air revives him: look, I pray thee, father, How the fresh air revives him: say not then All hope is banish'd quite.âThou shak'st thy head: But whilst I see upon his moving breast One heave of breath, betok'ning life within, I'll grasp at hope, and will not let it go. (Bending over the couch.) My son, my son! hearst thou my voice, my son? Zat. Yes, mother: I have had a fearful struggle. 'Tis a strong enemy that grapples with me, And I must yield to him.âO pious father! Pray thou for mercy on me. Countess. Yes, my son, This holy man shall pray for thee; the shrines Of holiest saints be gifted for thee; masses And sacred hymns be chanted for thy peace:â And thou thyself, even 'midst thine agony, Hast spoken precious words of heav'nly grace; Therefore be comforted. Zat. (shaking his head). There is no comfort here: dark, veil'd, and terrible, That which abides me; and how short a spaceâ Countess. O thou mayst yet recover! Con. Lady, forbear! this is no time to soothe With flatt'ring hopes: his term is near its close; Therefore, I do again entreat it of you, Sond off the messenger with his confession, Lest it should be too late to save the innocent, And he be sent unto his long account With a most heavy charge upon his head. Countess. Thou mak'st me tremble.âHo! There, you without! Send here the messenger. (Calling off the stage.) âHis steed is ready: He shall forthwith depart. Enter Messenger. Con. (to messenger). Take thou this packet, and with full-bent speed Go to the city to the governor, And see that into his own hand thou give it, With charges that he read it instantly. It is of precious moment to his life Who on the scaffold should this morning suffer. Quick mount thy horse: few minutes' goaded speed Will take thee to the gates. Mes. Few minutes' goaded speed, five leagues to master! Con. Five leagues! thou'rt mad. Mes. No, marry! know ye not The flooded river hath last night broken down The nearer bridge? Con. What, art thou sure of this? Mes. I am now come from gazing on the sight. From bank to bank the red swoln river roars; And on the deep and slowly-rolling mass Of its strong centre-tide, grumly and dark, The wrecks of cottages, whole ricks of grain, Trunks of huge trees, torn by the roots,âay, save us! And floating carcases of perish'd things, Bloated and black, are borne along; whilst currents Cross-set and furious, meeting adverse streams On rude uneven surface, far beyond The water's natural bed, do loudly war And terrible contest hold; and swelt'ring eddies With dizzy whirling fury, toss aloft Their surgy waves i' the air, and scatter round Their ceaseless bick'ring gleams of jagged foam, All fiercely whit'ning in the morning light. Crowds now are standing upon either shore In awful silence; not a sound is heard But the flood's awful voice, and from the city A dismal bell heard through the air by starts, Already tolling for the execution. Con. What's to be done? fate seems to war against us. No, no! we'll not despair! Mount thy fleet horse, Life and death's in thy speed:â Let nought one moment stop thee on thy way: All things are possible to vig'rous zeal: Life and death's in thy speed: depart! depart! And heaven be with thine efforts. [Exit messenger, after receiving the packet. Zat. Is he gone? is it done? Con. Yes, he is gone: God grant he be in time, For unto human reck'ning 'tis impossible! [To countess, with an upbraiding look. Half an hour soonerâ Countess. Oh, torment me not! Who could foresee this hind'rance?âO, good father! Look to thy penitent. Upon his count'nance There's something new and terrible. Speak to him: Go close to him, good father. O my son! Zat. I feel within me nowâthis is the feeling: I am upon the brink, the dreadful brink: It is a fearful gulf I have to shoot. O yet support me! in this racking pain I still may hold a space the grasp of life, And keep back from the dark and horridâOh! (Uttering a deep groan.) It is upon me! [Struggles and expires with a faint groan. Countess, wringing her hands in agony of grief, is hurried off the stage by the Confessor and attendants, who rush in and take hold of her. SCENE IV. An open square before the great gate of the prison: a crowd of spectators, with guards, &amp;c., are discovered, waiting for the coming forth of Rayner to his execution, and a solemn bell is heard at intervals. The gate opens, and enter Rayner walking between Mardonio and Hardibrand, and followed by Richard and Bertram, preceded and followed by guards, officers, &amp;c. The procession moves slowly over the stage, and exeunt, followed by the greater part of the crowd, though a good many of them still remain upon the stage. Then re-enter Hardibrand and Richard, followed by one or two of the crowd: Hardibrand walking up and down in a perturbed manner, and Richard leaning his back against the side-scene, where he continues motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground. The murmur of the multitude is heard for some time without, and then ceases, followed by a dead silence. 1st crowd. The sound of the multitude is still now. 2d crowd (looking out). I fancy, by the crowd who stand all gathered round yonder in dead silence, he is now preparing for the block. 3d crowd. It must be so: mercy on us, what a mantle of human faces there be spread round on every side, and not one sound of voice amongst them all! Har. (starting and stopping suddenly, to 1st crowd). A long pause. Didst thou hear aught? 1st crowd. No, they are still silent. Har. Look out, I pray thee, and tell me what thou seest. What dost thou gaze at with so broad an eye? 1st crowd looks out. 1st crowd. The executioner is now mounted upon the platform, and the prisonerâO! I cannot look any more! [A loud confused noise is heard without. Har. What's that? 2d crowd. It is like the cry of a great multitude, when they look upon something that is terrible. 1st crowd. Then the stroke is given, and it is all over now. [Hardibrand turns hastily away, and rushes to the other end of the stage, whilst Richard gives a heavy groan, and still remains motionless. A shout is heard without. Har. (returning furiously from the bottom of the stage). More of that horrible din!â May they bring down the welkin on their heads! 2d crowd (to 1st crowd). What art thou looking at now? 1st crowd. Nay, there is nothing to look at now: the platform is down, and the crowd is returning home again. Enter Ohio, running across the stage. Ohio. I've done it! I've done it! I've done it! [Exit. Enter a messenger in great haste, followed by a civil Officer. 1st crowd. Where are you running to so fast? Mes. Is the execution over? 1st crowd. Yes, it is over. Mes. Ah! then I am too late. 1st crowd. What mean ye by that? Mes. I brought a pardon for him. Har. (rushing upon the messenger and collaring him). A pardon! O confound your tardy speed! Had you upon some paltry wager striv'n, You had run faster. O, thou cursed fool! O hadst thou sped, I'd make a rich man of thee! Mes. (disentangling himself). My steed and I across the high-swoln flood, Those on the shore shrieking to see our boldness, Have fearless swum some miles short of the pass Which we must else have gain'd, or, by my faith, I had been later. Har. Thou liest, thou cursed fool! thou shouldst have sped Swift as a bullet from the cannon's mouth. [Collaring him again. Enter Rayner, Mardonio, Bertram, and crowd. Mar. (to Hardibrand, pulling him back from the messenger). Hold, general! what hath the poor man done? Har. What has he done! he's brought a pardon, fiend! [The crowd give a great shout, crying out âPardon, pardon,â and Hardibrand, turning round at the noise, and seeing Rayner, springs forward, and catches him in his arms. God bless us all, and let us keep our wits! Is this true seeing that my eyes are blest with? O welcome, welcome! this is wonderful! My boy! my noble boy! my gallant boy! Thou art a man again, and IâI'm mad: My head wheels round, but 'tis a blessed madness. What sayst thou? art thou silent? Hast no voice? Ray. To be upon the verge of death is awful; And awful from that verge to be recall'd. God bless you! O God bless you! I am spent; But let me draw my breath a little while, And I will thank youâI willâBear with me: I cannot speak. [Recovering himself, and seeing the crowd gather round him with joyful and sympathising looks. Surely 'tis a kind world I have return'd to; There's sympathy and love in ev'ry heart. Mar. (to messenger). Where is the pardon? let me have it, friend, That I may read it. [Messenger gives him a paper, which he reads. We charge thee upon our authority to set theâ [Reading the rest low to himself. What! call ye this a pardon which acquits The prisoner as guiltless of the crime? May God be praised! how has all this been? Mess. Count Zaterloo, who on his death-bed lies, In deep remorse, a paper of confession, Attested by a priest and his own mother, Caused to be drawn, which to the governor I've brought, I wot, as quickly as I might, Though (pointing to Hardibrand) this good gentlemanâ Har. (embracing the messenger). O no! O no! thou'rt a brave fellow now, And, as I've said, I'll make a rich man of thee. But I'm bewilder'd still: how hath it been That he is saved, seeing no pardon reach'd him? Mar. Yes, thou mayst wonder! for some unknown friend Had sawn across the main prop of the scaffold, So that the headsman mounting first, the platform Fell with a crash; and he, all maim'd and bruised, Unfit to do his office, was perforceâ Har. Ay, ay, 'tis plain, thou needst not tell me more.â But he, the unknown friendâ Enter Ohio, running exultingly. Ohio. 'Twas I that did it! Beat me and scourge me as ye list: I did it! He offer'd me his cloak: he pitied me; And I have paid him back. Har. Ha! well done and well said, my brave black thing! Art thou a prince? in faith I think thou art. I'll take thee home, and make a man of thee. No, no! (Pointing to Rayner.) Here is my son, my heir, my child: All that I have is his: he will reward thee. Thou hast a gen'rous mind, although debased With vile oppression and unmanly scorn. Ray. (taking Ohio and Hardibrand both by the hand). What shall I say to you? my heart would speak What my voice cannot. O! and here comes one Who mocks all power of words. [Enter Elizabeth running, and rushes into Rayner's arms; the crowd then eagerly gathers round them, and closes upon them. Mar. (stepping out from the crowd, and looking upon them). Yes, gather round him, kindly souls, though rude, In the true artless sympathy of nature; For he is one o'er whom the storm has roll'd In awful power, but spared the thunderbolt.â When urged by strong temptation to the brink Of guilt and ruin, stands the virtuous mind With scarce a step between; all pitying heaven, Severe in mercy, chast'ning in its love, Ofttimes, in dark and awful visitation, Doth interpose, and leads the wand'rer back To the straight path, to be for ever after A firm, undaunted, onward-bearing traveller Strong in humility, who swerves no more.

Fortune-teller, citizens, attendants, &amp;c.WOMEN Valeria, wife of Constantine. Ella, daughter of Petronius. Lucia, a lady attendant on Valeria. Ladies and attendants. The Scene in Constantinople, and in the camp of Mahomet, near the city. ACT I. SCENE I. A large platform on the roof of the palace of Petronius, from which are seen spires and towers, and the broken roofs of houses, &amp;c., with the general appearance of a ruined city, the distant parts involved in smoke. Ella is discovered with an attendant, standing on a balcony belonging to a small tower, rising from the side of the platform. As the curtain draws up the sound of artillery is heard. Enter Othus and Marthon. Othus. Ah, see how sadly changed the prospect is Since first from our high station we beheld This dismal siege begin! 'Midst level ruin, Our city now shows but its batter'd towers, Like the jagg'd bones of some huge animal, Whose other parts the mould'ring hand of time To dust resolves. Mar. (coldly). It does indeed some faint resemblance hold To what thou hast compared it to. How is't? Art thou not from the walls? Othus. No, not immediately. Mar. Wast thou not there when Mahomet's huge cannon Open'd its brazen mouth and spoke to us? How brook'd thine ears that deep tremendous sound? The coasts of Asia and th' Olympian heights, Our land-begirded seas, and distant isles, Spoke back to him again, in his own voice, A deep and surly answer; but our city, This last imperial seat of Roman greatness: This head of the world, this superb successor Of the earth's mistress, where so many CÃ¦sars In proud successive lines have held their sway, What answer sent she back? Othus. Fy, hold thy tongue! Methinks thou hast a pleasure in the thought. This head o' the worldâthis superb successor Of the earth's mistress, as thou vainly speakst, Stands 'mid these ages, as in the wide ocean The last spared fragment of a spacious land, That in some grand and awful ministration Of mighty nature has ingulfed been, Doth lift aloft its dark and rocky cliffs O'er the wild waste around, and sadly frowns In lonely majesty. But shame upon it! Her feeble, worthless, and degen'rate sonsâ Mar. Yes, what sayst thou of them? they also are The fragments of a brave and mighty race, Left on this lonely rock. Othus. No, blast them! on its frowning sides they cluster Like silly sea-fowl from their burrow'd holes, Who, staring senseless on th' invader's toil, Stretch out their worthless necks, and cry âcaw! caw!â O, Paleologus! how art thou left, Thou and thy little band of valiant friends, To set your manly bosoms 'gainst the tide! Ye are the last sparks of a wasted pyre Which soon shall be trodd'n out.â Ye are the last green bough of an old oak, Blasted and bare: the lovelier do ye seem For its wan barrenness; but to its root The axe is brought, and with it ye must fall.â Ye areâO God! it grasps my swelling throat To think of what ye are. Mar. A brave band, truly:â But still our gallant emp'ror and his friends, Opposed to Mah'met and his num'rous host With all his warlike engines, are in truth As if one toss'd against the whirl'd-up sands Of their Arabian plains, one grasp of dust. Othus. Yes, they are few in number, but they are The essence and true spirit of their kind; The soul of thousands. A brave band they are, Not levied by the power and wealth of states; And the best feelings of the human heart Have been the agents of their princely chief, Recruiting nobly. Virtuous Sympathy, Who on the weaker and deserted side Her ample, lib'ral front doth ever range; Keen Indignation, who, with clenched hand And sternly-flashing eye, ever beholds The high o'erbearing crest of proud oppression; And gen'rous Admiration, above all, Of noble deeds, whose heav'n-enlighten'd smile, And imitative motion, ever wake With eager heart-throbs at the glorious sight Of manly daring, have unto their numbers Some score of dauntless spirits lately added; Such as would ride upon the whirlwind's back, If it might be, and with heaven's spearmen cope. With such a band, methinks, all things are possible. Mar. (smiling). Why, thou soft man of peace, Who in gay banquets spend'st thy giddy nights, And o'er some sculptured stone, or ancient lore, Each idle morning wast'st in the cool shade, Thou speakest with a bold and warlike voice! Othus (throwing back his cloak, and showing under it a warlike garb, with the scarf and devices belonging to the imperial band). Ay, and wear, too, a bold and warlike form. Behold what now I am? Thou shrinkest back, And lookest strangely on me: give thy lips No friendly blessing to my new estate? Mar. Heaven bless the brave! Othus. Amen! but thou art cold. [Sound of artillery is heard again. O hear that sound! Doth it not stir thee as it thund'ring growls Along the distant shore? [Shaking his head. It moves thee not. Is that the sound of female voices near us? Mar. Yes; seest thou not on yon high balcony That pale and fearful maid? her watchful ear Is ever turn'd to ev'ry distant sound. Othus. My gentle kinswoman upon the watch! I know for whom she fears; nor do I marvel; For she was present on that crowded shore, When Genoa's captain brought his gen'rous succour, And saw the brave contention of those men, In their proud vessels bearing boldly on, With wavy pendants floating on the wind, Whose armed sides, like to a goodly bank, Breasted the onward tide of opposition. [Speaking with a great deal of appropriate gesture. No wonder that her fancy has been moved! Oh, it did stir the women on our wallsâ The infantsâyea, the very household curs, That from their kennels turn'd to look upon it!â But for that motley crowd of moving things Which we miscall our menâNay, by the light, Thou too dost hear me with a frozen eye! Enter Ella hastily from the balcony, and puts her hand eagerly upon the shoulder of Othus, who turns round surprised. Ella. What sayest thou of him? where fights he now? Or on the land, or on some floating fence? Othus. Of whom speakst thou, fair Ella? Ella. Nay, nay! thou knowst right well. Did I not see thee, High as I stood, e'en now, tossing thine arms, And motioning thy tale with such fit gestures As image ships and sails, and daring deeds? Of whom speak even the beggars in our streets When they such action use? Thou knowst right well, Of Genoa's captain, and of none but him. Didst see him from the walls? Othus (smiling). My little kinswoman, Thou lookest with a keen and martial eye As thou dost question me: I saw him not; I come not from the walls. Ella. Didst thou not talk of him as I descended? Othus. Yes, of that noble fight.âBut dost thou see? There are more warriors in the world, Ella, [Pointing to his dress Though men do talk of us, it must be granted, With action more composed. Behold me now The brave Rodrigo's comrade, and the friend Of royal Constantine; who is in truth The noblest beast o' the herd, and on the foe Turns a bold front, whilst with him boldly join A few brave antlers from a timid crowd, That quakes and cowers behind. Ella. Yes, Othus, I did mark thy martial garb: Heaven's angels bless thee! Othus. And earth's too, gentle Ella. [Artillery heard again. Ella (to Othus, starting fearfully). O dost thou smile, and such light words affect, Whilst ruin growls so near us? hath sad use Made misery and sport, and death and merriment, amiliar neighbours?âI'll into my chamber. Enter Petronius and a disguised Turk. Pet. (sternly to Ella). Yes, to thy chamber go: thou liv'st, methinks On the house-top, or watching in the towers. I like it not; and maiden privacy Becomes thy state and years. (To Othus.) Ha! art thou Othus? Thou'rt well accoutred, sooth! I knew thee not. Mar. Yes, he is now a valiant soldier grown: His Grecian lute, and pen, and books of grace Are thrown aside, and the soft letter'd sage Grasps a rude lance. Ella. Nay, mock him not, for it is nobly done. Pet. (sternly to Ella). Art thou still here? [Exit Ella, abashed and chidden. And now, my lord,â [Turning to Othus. Othus (angrily). And now, my lord, good evening: I too, belike, shall trespass on your patience, If longer I remain. [Exit Pet. Well, let him go, it suits our purpose better. [Exit. But who could e'er have thought in warlike garb To see him guised? He, too, become a fool! Mar. He thought, as well I guess, to move me also His brave devoted brotherhood to join: This was his errand here. Pet. I do believe it well: for Constantine, With many fair and princely qualities That in his clear morn no attention drew, Now, on the brow of dark adversity, Hangs like a rainbow on a surly cloud, And all men look to him. But what avails This growing sentiment of admiration To our good means? Good Turk, where, is thy gold? Turk (giving him a bag). There, Christian, whom I may not well call good. Pet. That as thou wilt: but Mahomet, thy master, Shall find me still his faithful agent here. This very night, as I have promised to him, The people shall in insurrection rise, Clam'ring to have the city yielded up; And if your narrow caution stint me not In that which rules the storm, it shall be raised To the full pitch. Turk. And what is that, Petronius? Pet. More gold. Ay, by thy turban and thy beard! There is a way to make our timid sluggards The sultan's work within these walls perform Better than armed men. Turk. And what is that, I pray? Pet. Why, more gold still.â I have in pay, besides our mutinous rabble, Who bawl, and prate, and murmur in our streets, Prophets, and conjurors, and vision-seers, And wise men, not a few, whose secret haunts The timid flock to: many are the palms That must be touch'd.âThere are within our walls Of idle, slothful citizens, enow, If with their active master they should join, Still to defend them: therefore, be assured, He who shall keep this fickle, wav'ring herd From such wise union, shall to Mah'met give This mistress of the East. Turk. Fear not; thou shalt be satisfied. Pet. Right: let us now to work: 'tis near the time When, from the walls returning with his friends, The emperor his ev'ning hour enjoys, And puts off warlike cares: now let us forth, And urge those varlets on. (To Marthon.) Do thou into the eastern quarter go, And stir them up. Where is our trusty Gorbus? The western is his province. Send him hither: We must some counsel hold: meantime within I wait his coming. Be thou speedy, Marthon. [Exit Marthon. To the Turk.) Remember, friend. Turk. Thou shalt be satisfied. Pet. Good fortune smile upon us! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A state apartment in the imperial palace, with splendid sideboards, set forth, on which are seen cups and goblets, &amp;c. as if prepared for a grand repast, and several domestics crossing the stage, carrying different things in their hands. Enter Heugho, followed by a stranger and two inferior domestic officers. Heugho (after looking over every thing). Is nought omitted here? the rubied platters And the imperial cupâI see them not. 1st offi. What boots it now, encompass'd thus with foes, And death and ruin grinning at our side, To set forth all this sumptuous garniture, Which soon shall in a Turkish harem shine? The emp'ror heeds it not. Heugho (stamping with his foot). Dog, but I heed it! And were the floating remnant of a wreck, With the sea bellowing round it, all that now Remain'd of the eastern empire, I thereon, Until the last wave wash'd us from its side, Would humbly offer to brave Constantine The homage due to mine imperial lord. Out on thee, paltry hind! go fetch them hither. [Exit officer. Stranger. This is the hour, you say, when Constantine, Like a tired woodman from his daily toil, Unclasps his girded breast; and with his friends Enjoys his social meal right cheerfully For one so overshadow'd with dark fate. I am a stranger here, and, by your leave, I fain would tarry still to have one view Of his most noble countenance. Heugho. Thou'rt welcome. And, gentle stranger, thou wilt see a prince, Who ably might have reign'd, had not his heart To the soft shades of friendly intercourse Still turn'd, as to its true and native place: A prince with loving friends, but lacking troops: Rich in the dear good-will of gen'rous minds, But poor in kingly allies. One thou'lt see, Whose manly faculties, beset with gifts Of gentler grace, and soft domestic habits, And kindliest feelings, have within him grown Like a young forest-tree, beset and 'tangled, And almost hidd'n with sweet incumb'ring shrubs; That, till the rude blast rends this clust'ring robe, Its goodly hardy stem to the fair light Discovers not. Hark! now they come! [Flourish of trumpets. Stand thou secure, and see whate'er thou wilt. [Calling to some people off the stage Ho! you without! move there with more despatch. [Several domestics again cross the stage as before. Stranger. See, yonder come the brave imperial friends, If right I guess. They bear a noble mien. And who is he who foremost walks with steps Of gravely-measured length, and heavy eyes Fix'd on the ground? [Pointing off the stage. Heugho. That is Justiniani; a brave soldier, Who doth o' tiptoe walk, with jealous care, Upon the very point and highest ridge Of honour's path, demure and circumspect, Like nicest maid, proud of her spotless fame; A steady, cheerless friend. Stranger. And who is he with open, lib'ral front, Who follows next? Heugho. He is the brave Rodrigo; That Genoese, who, with four gallant ships, Did in the front of the whole Turkish fleet So lately force his passage to our port, Bearing us gen'rous and most needful succour. Does he not look like one, who in the fight Would fiercely strive, yet to the humbled foe Give quarter pleasantly? Stranger. And who comes after with more polish'd aspect, But yet, methinks, keen and intelligent? Heugho. Oh, that is Othus; a soft letter'd sage, Who wears his soldier's garb with its first gloss. Stranger. Constantine comes not yet? Heugho. No; first of all to his imperial dame, Who o'er his mind a greater influence has Than may, perhaps, with graver wisdom suit, Being a dame of keen and lofty passions, Though with fair virtues graced, he ever pays His dear devotions: he will join them shortly. But softly, here they are. Enter Justiniani, Rodrigo, Othus, and many others of the Emperor's friends, armed as if returned from the walls. Rod. (to Justiniani). Thou'rt sternly grave: has aught in this day's fight Befall'n, thy eager temper to disturb? Just. Your first directed fire should, in good right, Have been against that Turkish standard sent, Rear'd in their front. Rod. And shall we seriously expend our strength In paying worship to each Turkish rag That waves before our walls? But frown not on me, friend: perhaps I'm wrong. We who are bred upon a bark's rough side, And 'midst the rude contention of the waves, Must force our steady purpose, as we may, Right in the teeth of all opposing things, Wrestling with breakers on the scourged rock, Or tilting it with a seal's cub, good faith! As it may chance; nought do we know of forms. Othus. Another time, valiant Justiniani, With more respect to warlike ceremony We will conduct ourselves. Rodrigo well hath pled his own excuse; And I, thou knowest, am but new in arms. Just. Methinks, e'en to a child it had been plain That, when so circumstancedâ Othus. Hush, hush, I pray thee, now! the emp'ror comes: This is his hour of cheerful relaxation, Snatch'd from each circling day of busy cares, A faint gleam thrown across a dismal gloom, Let us not darken it with petty brawls. Enter Constantine. Con. (saluting them). A pleasant meeting to us all, brave friends, After our day of toil! There be among us Tired limbs that well have carn'd their hour of rest; This kindly-social hour, this fleeting bliss Of the tired labourer. Undo our bracings, And let us sup as lightly as we may. [Taking off his helmet, which he gives to an attendant. This galls me strangely; Mine armourer, methinks, has better skill To mar men's heads than save them. Nay all of you, I pray. [They all begin to take off their helmets, and part of their armour. And gentle Othus too, unbrace thyself: How likest thou the gripe of soldiers' gear? Othus. Worn in the cause, for which I wear it now, It feels like the close hug of a rough friend, Awkward but kindly. Con. Thanks, gen'rous Othus! it had pleased me better To've had the gentle service of thy pen. Thou couldst have told, if so it might have been, How brave men acted, and how brave men fell.â Well, let it be. [Turning aside to check his emotion, and then assuming a cheerful face. You gallant seamen, in th' applauding view Of the throng'd beach, amidst the tempest's rage, E'en on the last plank of your sever'd bark, Ride it careeringly, my brave Rodrigo! Rod. Yes, royal sir; with brave true-hearted mates All things we do and bear right cheerfully. Con. And so will we.âYour hand, my gallant friend! And yours, and yours, and yours, my brave Eubedesâ And noble Carlos tooâand all of youâ [Taking all their hands, one after another. I am indeed so mated. Bring me a cooling cup, I pray, good Heugho, My tongue is parch'd. [Heugho presents a cup to him, kneeling. What, wilt thou still upon thine aged limbs These cumbrous forms impose? These surly times Suit not such ceremony, worthy Heugho. Heugho. Be health and sweet refreshment in the draught, My royal master! Con. (tasting it). And so there is: few cups presented thus Come with such kindness. But I have, in truth, Shrunk, as a potentate, to such small grasp, That now I fairly may put in my claim To the affections of a man.âBrave friends, Health to you all! [Drinks, then turning with a smile to Justiniani. Justiniani, I with thee alone Have cause of quarrel in this day's long toil. Just. How so, and please your highness? The holy hermit, counting o'er his beads, Is not more scrupulous than I have been Nought of his sacred duty to omit. Con. Thou putst a gross affront upon the worth Of all thy warlike deeds; for thou from them Claimst not the privilege to save thyself From needless dangers. On the walls this day Thou hast exposed thyself like a raw stripling, Who is ashamed to turn one step aside When the first darts are whizzing past his ear. Rodrigo there, beneath a pannier Would save his head from the o'er-passing blow, Then, like a lion issuing from his den, Burst from his shelter with redoubled ardour. Pray thee put greater honour on thyself, And I will thank thee for it. Just. I stand reproved. Con. I'm glad thou dost.âNow to our social rites! No tired banditti in their nightly cave, Whose goblets sparkle to the ruddy gleam Of blazing faggots, eat their jolly meal With toils, and dangers, and uncertainty Of what to-morrow brings, more keenly season'd Than we do ours.âSpare not, I pray thee, Heugho, Thy gen'rous Tuscan cup: I have good friends Who prize its flavour much. [As he turns to go with his friends to the bottom of the stage, where a curtain between the pillars being drawn up, discovers their repast set out; a citizen enters in haste. Cit. I crave to speak unto the emperor. Con. What is thine errand? Cit. My royal sir, the city's in commotion: From ev'ry street and alley, ragged varlets In crowds pour forth, and threaten mighty things. But one, whom I outran, comes on my steps To bring a fuller tale. Con. (to citizen). Thou'rt sure of this? Cit. It is most certain. Con. (to Othus). What thinkst thou, good Othus? Othus. I doubt it not: 'tis a degraded herd That fills your walls. This proud imperial city Has been in ages past the great high-way Of nations driving their blind millions on To death and carnage. Through her gates have pass'd Pale cowled monarchs and red-sworded saints, Voluptuaries foul, and hard-eyed followers Of sordid gainâyea, all detested things. She hath a common lake or sludge-pool been, In which each passing tide has left behind Some noisome sediment. She is choked up With mud and garbage to the very brim. Her citizens within her would full quietly A pagan's slaves become, would he but promise The sure continuance of their slothful ease. Some few restraints upon their wonted habits And Mah'met's gold, no doubt, have roused the fools To this unwonted stir. Con. It may be so: I shall wait further tidings. Meantime, my friends, go ye, and as ye can, Snatch a short soldier's meal. [They hesitate. Nay, go I pray you! I must not to my friends say âI command.â [They all go immediately, and without any order standing round the table, begin to eat. (To the citizen remaining still on the front of the stage.) And so thou saystâBut lo! another messenger. Enter another Citizen in great haste. 2d cit. The citizens in crowdsâthe men and womenâ The very children tooâmine eyes have seen itâ In crowds they comeâ Con. Take breath, and tell thy tale Distinctly. From what quarter comest thou? 2d cit. I'm from the east. Enter 3d Citizen. 3d cit. I come to tell your highness that the city Is in commotion; e'en with flesh-forks arm'd, And all the implements of glutt'nous sloth, The people pour along in bawling crowds, Calling out, âbread,â and âMah'met,â and âsurrender,â Towards the royal palace. Con. And whence art thou? 3d cit. I'm from the western quarter. Con. Ha! spreads it then so wide? [Calling to his friends at the bottom of the stage. Friends, by your leave, I somewhat must upon your goodness bear. Give me my helmet and my sword again: This is no partial fray. [Beginning to arm, whilst all the rest follow his example. Rod. Well, let us jostle with these ragged craft, And see who grapples best. [Buckling on his armour gaily. Just. A soldier scorns to draw his honour'd blade On such mean foes: we'll beat them off with sticks. Othus. Words will, perhaps, our better weapons prove, When used as brave men's arms should ever be, With skill and boldness. Swords smite single foes, But thousands by a word are struck at once. [As they all gather round Constantine, and are ready to follow him, enter Valeria in great alarm, followed by Lucia, and several ladies. Val. (to Constantine). O, hast thou heard it? Con. Yes, my love, they've told me. Val. From the high tower my ladies have descried The dark spires redd'ning in their torches' light, Whilst, like the hoarse waves of a distant sea, Their mingled voices sweet as they approach. Con. It is a storm that soon will be o'erblown: I will oppose to them a fixed rock, Which they may beat against but cannot shake. Val. That is thyself.âO, no! thou shalt not go! Yea, I am bold! misfortune mocks at state, And strong affection scorns all reverence; Therefore, before these lords, e'en upon thee, Thou eastern CÃ¦sar, do I boldly lay My woman's hand, and say, âthou shalt not go.â Con. Thy woman's hand is stronger, sweet Valeria, Than warrior's iron grasp, But yet it may not hold me. Strong affection Makes thee most fearful where no danger is: Shall eastern CÃ¦sar, like a timid hind Scared from his watch, conceal his cowering head? And does an empire's dame require it of him? Val. Away, away! with all those pompous sounds! I know them not. I by thy side have shared The public gaze, and the applauding shouts Of bending crowds: but I have also shared The hour of thy heart's sorrow, still and silent, The hour of thy heart's joy. I have supported Thine aching head, like the poor wand'rer's wife, Who, on his seat of turf, beneath heaven's roof, Rests on his way.âThe storm beats fiercely on us: Our nature suits not with these worldly times, To it most adverse. Fortune loves us not; She hath for us no good: do we retain Her fetters only? No, thou shalt not go! [Twining her arms round him. By that which binds the peasant and the prince, The warrior and the slave, all that do bear The form and nature of a man, I stay thee! Thou shalt not go. Con. Wouldst thou degrade me thus? Val. Wouldst thou unto my bosom give death's pang? Thou lov'st me not. Con. (with emotion, stretching out his hands to his friends, who stand at some distance). My friends, ye see how I am fetter'd here. Ye who thus bravely to my fortunes cling With generous love, less to redeem their fall Than on my waning fate by noble deeds To shed a parting ray of dignity: Ye gen'rous and devoted; still with you I thought to share all dangers: go ye now, And to the current of this swelling tide Set your brave breasts alone! [Waving them off with his hand, and then turning to her. Now, wife, where wouldst thou lead me? Val. (pointing with great energy to the friends who are turning as if to go out). There, there! O, there! thou hast no other way. [Brushing away her tears hastily, and then assuming an air of dignity, she takes Constantine by the hand, and leading him across the stage, presents him to his friends. Most valiant, honour'd men, receive your chief, Worthy the graceful honours of your love, And heaven's protecting angel go with you! [Exeunt Constantine and his friends, paying obeisance to her as they retire, which she returns with the profoundest respect, continuing to look after them till they are out of sight; then returning to the front of the stage with a deep sigh, remains for some time with her eyes fixed on the ground. Lucia. My dear and royal mistress, be not thus! The people will their sov'reign lord respect. Val. Will they? Where is my little Georgian maid, Whose grandsire, though a brave and sov'reign prince, Was piecemeal torn by a ferocious crowd? Lucia. She told a wonderful surcharged tale, Perhaps to move your pity: heed it not. Val. Ah! whereunto do all these turmoils tendâ The wild contention of these fearful times? Each day comes bearing on its weight of ills, With a to-morrow shadow'd at its back, More fearful than itself.âA dark progressionâ And the dark end of all, what will it be? Lucia. Let not such gloomy thoughts your mind o'ercast; Our noble emperor has on his side The dark and potent powers. Val. What is thy meaning? Lucia. A rarely-gifted man, come from afar, Who sees strange visions rise before his sight Of things to come, hath solemnly pronounced it, That Paleologus has on his side The dark and potent powers. Val. Alas! alas! are they the friends of virtue? Who told thee this? Lucia. One unto whom he told such marv'llous things As did all natural knowledge far exceed. Val. Thou dost impress me with a strange desire, As though it were upon my mind impress'd By secret supernatural power. Methinks, Were this dread night with all its dangers past, I too would fainâHa! hark! what noise is that? [Listening with great alarm. Hark, hark! it is the sound of many sounds, Mingled and terrible, though heard afar. Lucia. Shall I ascend the tower, and give you notice Whate'er I see? Val. (eagerly). I'll go myself. [Exit in great alarm, followed by Lucia and ladies. ACT II. SCENE I. An open street before the imperial palace. A crowd of men, women, and children discovered, bearing in their hands torches, with clubs, sticks, &amp; c., and the stage entirely lighted by the red glare of their torches cast up against the walls of the building. The confused noise and clamour of a great crowd is heard as the curtain draws up. 1st crowd. Holla! let them come forth who trouble us, And love they blood and beating, they shall have it. 2d crowd. Surrender! bread and wine, and peaceful days! Surrender, devils, or ye shall pay the cost! [All the crowd call out clamorously, and brandish their torches, &amp;c., in a threatening manner against the palace. 3d crowd. Must we, men well instructed, rear'd, and cherish'd, The chiefest of all townsmen of the earth; We, whom all nations know and look upon With envious worshipâmust we from our meals And quiet couches, like your rude barbarians, Be scared and roused with the continued bellowing Of curst artillery? it is a shame. 1st crowd. It is a crying, an insulting shame. E'en Mahomet regards our polish'd race And rare acquirements; but for Constantineâ 2d crowd. Ay, ay! let him come forth with his base crew Of savage strangers; and should they refuse us, E'en with good teeth and nails, fail other means, We will do vultures' work upon them all. (All of them calling out together, and brandishing their torches, &amp;c., as before.) Holla! holla! we say to you again; Emperor! Constantine! come forth to us! [A grand door of the palace opens, from which two flights of stairs descend into the street, and Constantine, with his friends, appear coming out upon the landing-place. The crowd raise a great noise upon seeing him, and he stretches out his hand as if he wished to speak, but they still continue loud and clamorous. Con. Audience, if that your sov'reign may command it! 4th crowd. Yes, let us hear what he will say to us. (Several together.) There is no harm in that: peace all of you! Con. Behold me at your wish, assembled citizens: Was it the voice of children or of foes That call'd me forth? 3d crowd. Go to with mocking words! are we thy children? Con. Ye say, indeed, too truly! children do Support, and honour, and obey their sire: They put their aiding hand to every burden That presses on him: ever gather round him When dark misfortune lowers; and, strong in them, He lifts his honour'd head amidst the storm, Blessing and bless'd. But I have stood in the dark pass alone, Facing its fiercest onset. In your homes Ye've stretch'd your easy limbs and fann'd your brows, Whilst I in parching toil have spent the day, Aided by strangers. Ye too truly say âAre we thy children?ââWhen my sky was clear, Ye follow'd me with fond applauding love, And bade God bless your sire; but when it lower'd, Back to your homes ye shrank, and gen'rous strangers Are by my side where children should have stood. (A confused murmur rises amongst them, and some call out). He speaks good reason, neighbours. (Others call out.) Out on it! all fair words! (Others.) Peace, sirs! we'll hear him out. (Others.) No! no! no! no! [Brandishing their torches violently. Othoric (breaking through them with a great club in his hands). Peace, friends, I say! I am a strong Hungarian, And I will hear him out. [The clamour subsides. Con. Yes, when the tempest lower'd, ye shrank away. But if some gen'rous shame has moved you nowâ If, thus assembled, with repentant zeal Ye would return, behold these open'd arms! O there be still amongst you men sufficient To save your city, your domestic roofs, Your wives, your children, all that good men love; Were each one willing for a little term To face but half the dangers which perforce Not doing this, he stands exposed to; To bear but half the toils which I bear daily, And shall bear lovingly! 1st crowd. Go to! surrender and have done with it. Who thanksâwho calls upon thee for thy toils? Con. That voice, which, in the hour of trial, bids The good man give his soft and sensitive frame To death and torture, and e'en fearful woman Bend her fair neck unto the uplifted stroke, Calls upon meâyea, and I will obey it! Othoric. By the good saints, he speaks like a brave man. 1st crowd. Acts he like one? will he come down to us? (Several speaking together.) He does; he comes in truth! [Constantine, after speaking in dumb show to his friends, descends the stairs. 2d crowd. Ay, in good faith, he comes unarmed too! Con. No, citizens, unarm'd I am not come; For ev'ry good man here some weapon wears For my defence. 4th crowd. Yes, he says well; and we'll defend him too. (Several others.) And so we will; huzza! huzza! huzza! Long live brave Constantine, our noble Emperor! (Many speaking at once.) No, no! peace and surrender is our call! [Raising loud cries, and brandishing their torches with violent threatening gestures. 4th crowd. Hear him out, fools, and he'll perhaps consent To hon'rable surrender. Con. (to 4th crowd, and those who range themselves on his side). No, friends; if in this hope with me ye stand, Turn to your place again; for whilst I breathe, With men enough in these encompass'd walls To fire one gun, never shall Turkish banner Upon our turrets wave. In this firm mind, Upon those walls I am content to die, By foemen slain, or, if heav'n wills it so, Here on this spot, by those I will not name. Othoric. No! we will die first, be it as it may, Ere one hair of thy noble head shall fall! Crowd (on Constantine's side) Long live brave Constantine! brave Paleologus! Huzza! huzza! Crowd (on Constantine's side) No; bread, and peace, and Mahomet, say we! [Both parties call out tumultuously, and threaten one another, and Rodrigo, Justiniani, and Othus rush down amongst them, leaving their other friends to guard the door of the palace. 2d crowd (to Rodrigo). Ay, thou sea-lion! thou too needs must come To growl upon us. Rod. No, faith! I know you well: ye are at large A set of soft, luxurious, timid slaves, On whom a cat with muffled paws might mew, And ye would turn from it.âBut still amongst you, I would upon it pledge my mane and claws, There are some honest souls who have ere now Quaff'd their full bumpers to a brave man's health, And I, in sooth, am come, with their good leave, To shake hands with them all. [Holding out his hand invitingly to the opposite crowd. Come; who loves valiant worth and Paleologus, Give me his hand. (Many of the crowd giving him their hands.) There is one for thee. (Second.) Ay, and there. (Third.) And there. Rod. (to one who hesitates). And thou, too, for thou wearst upon thy brow A soldier's look: I must perforce have thee. [Casting up his hat in the air, and joined by all the crowd on his side. Long live brave Constantine! huzza! [This they continue to do till the opposite party are dispirited and beat off the stage. Rodrigo then presents his newly-acquired friends to Constantine. Con. I thank you all, my brave and zealous friends. Within the palace walls I'll now conduct you, And marshal there my new-gain'd strength, for which I give heaven thanks. [Exeunt; Constantine, followed by his friends, &amp;c. Rodrigo walking last, and just about to go off the stage, when Othoric re-enters by the opposite side, and calls after him. Othoric. Hark ye! a word with you, my noble captain. Rod. (returning). What wouldst thou say? Othoric. Look on my face; my name is Othoric; I'm strong, thou seest, and have a daring soul; Look on my face; my name is Othoric: Thinkst thou thou shalt remember me, though thou Shouldst ne'er again behold me? Rod. I shall, my friend: thou hast a daring countenance. Othoric. My deeds shall not belie it. With this crowd I came, a stranger of most desp'rate fortune, And hired by treach'rous men fell work to do. But now, unhired, I'll do for your brave master A deed that shall make Turkish ears to tingle, And Christian too, or fail it or succeed. Rod. What wilt thou do? Othoric. The consciousness of what one arm performs Let one heart keep. Rod. Heaven aid and prosper then thy secret thought, If it be good and honest! Fare thee well! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A small narrow street, before a private sombre-looking house. Enter Othus and Rodrigo. Othus. Move slowly here, for now we pass the fane, In which the mystic vision-seeing sage To ears of faith speaks his wild oracles. Rod. What, he of whom we've heard such marv'llous things? Othus. Yes; such perturbed times his harvest prove, When anxious minds, in dread of coming ill, Would draw aside, impatiently, the veil Of dark futurity.âSoftly, I pray: A female form now issues from the door: It moves, methinks, like Ella. Enter Ella from the house, with a female Attendant. Rod. (eagerly). It is herself, and I will speak to her. Fair maid, as well I guess by that light trip, Thy lover's fate hangs on a lucky thread; Tough, and well whiten'd in a kindly sun. Ella. Well hast thou guess'd: fortune is passing kind; She leads thee, fights for thee, and guards thy head From ev'ry foeman's stroke. Rod. Ay, but thy lover, Ella! was it not Of him we spoke? Ella. Fy, do not mock me thus! Othus. In truth he mocks thee, Ella, and no faith To fates foretold or mystic sages gives. Rod. Believe him not, sweet maid. We seamen, truly, Small dealings have with learned sorcery; Nor bead, nor book, nor ring, nor mutter'd rhymes, Are for our turn: but on the sea-rock's point, In shape of hern, or gull, or carrion-bird, Our un-feed wizards sit, and, with stretch'd throats, Speak strange mysterious things to wave-toss'd men, With many perils compass'd. Nay, ofttimes The mermaid, seated on her coral throne, Spreading her yellow hair to the sunn'd breeze, Will sing a song of future fortunes fair To him who has the luck to meet with her: And e'en the nightly winds will through our shrouds Distinctive voices utter unto those, Who in their storm-rock'd cradles lie, and think Of their far-distant homes.âI do believe That all good fortune shall betide thy love, Being thy love; for that doth far outdo All other fortune; and besides, no doubt, A fair and courtly youth. Ella. Go to! go to! thou mockest me again! I love a brave manâ Rod. And not passing fair, Nor very courtly? Othus. No, nor wearing now His youth's best bloom; but somewhat weatherbeaten, And sunn'd on sultry shores? Ella. Fy on you both, you hold me in derision! I'm young, and all unlearn'd, and well I know Not passing sage; but do I merit this? [Turns to go away from them in tears. Rod. By heavens thou shalt not go! [Catching hold of her hand to prevent her. Thou sweetest thing That e'er did fix its lightly-fibred sprays To the rude rock, ah! wouldst thou cling to me? Rough and storm-worn I am: but if thou lov'st me,â Thou truly dost,âI will love thee again With true and honest heart, though all unmeet To be the mate of such sweet gentleness. Othus. I hear a noise of footsteps: we'll retire; Let us pursue our way. [Looking behind as they go off. 'Tis one belonging to Valeria's train, Who hither comes with quick and eager gait. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A large sombre room, with mystical figures and strange characters painted upon the walls, and lighted only by one lamp, burning upon a table near the front of the stage. Enter a Conjuror in a long loose robe, and Petronius, meeting him, by opposite sides. Pet. Well, my good sage, how thrives thy mystic trade? Go all things prosperously? Con. As thou couldst wish: to many a citizen I have the fix'd decree of fate foretold, Which to the Sultan gives this mighty city, Making all opposition and defence Vain; and their superstition works for us Most powerfully. Pet. So far 'tis well; but be thou on thy guard; I am expressly come to caution thee. Should any visit thee, whom thou suspectest To be connected with th' imperial friends, Be sure thy visions speak to them of things Pleasant to loyal ears. Con. Fear not; I have already been forewarn'd, And have such caution follow'd. Pet. Thou hast done wisely: still keep on thy guard, And be not e'en surprised if thou, ere long, Shouldst have a royal visiter. My agents, Who in th' imperial palace are on watch, Have giv'n me notice that Valeria's mind Is this way bent. If so, let thy delusions Still tempt her in the city to remain, For herein is the Sultan much concern'd. Hash! we are interrupted. Enter a Servant. Serv. (to con.). A noble matron craves to speak with thee. Con. Dost thou not know her? Serv. No; in a black stole She's closely veil'd; yet noble is her gait; And her attendant underneath his cloak, But ill conceal'd, wears an imperial crest. Pet. and Con. (both together). Can it indeed be she? [Pausing to consider. Con. I'll venture it. (To servant.) Go and conduct her hither. [Exit servant. It must be she: I'll boldly venture it. Pet. Thou mayst with little risk: meantime, remember The caution I have given thee. Con. Trust to my skill, and be a while withdrawn, My noble patron. [Exit Petronius. Enter Valeria, concealed under a long black stole, followed by Lucia and two female attendants, who remain at the bottom of the stage whilst she comes forward. Con. Approach, great dame. Val. Yes, in misfortune so; That is my eminence: and unto thee I come, an anxious suitor, if that truly Th' unseen mysterious powers, with whom thou dealst, To human weal and woe alliance bear, And may unto the care-rack'd mind foreshow The path of awful fate that lies before it. I do beseech thee!â Con. Say thou dost command; For through that sable stole, were it as thick As midnight's curtain, still I could behold Thy keenly-glancing eye, and the dark arch Of royal brows accustom'd to command. Val. Ha! dost thou see me? Con. Yea; and who is he, Whose shadowy unreal form behind thee towers, As link'd with thine though absent? O'er his head Th' imperial eagle soars, and in his hand He grasps the emblem of supreme command. Val. (throwing back the stole with astonishment mixed with fear). O, most mysterious and wonderful! Nothing is hid from thee: thou seest afar The distant death's day of the swathed babe, Falling in hoary age, and the life's morn Of those who are not.âHere then all confess'd, A wretched empress and a trembling wife, I stand before thee. O let thy keen eye Through the dark mist that limits nature's sight, Follow that phantom o'er whose head doth soar Th' imperial bird! for, be it good or ill, His fate is mine, and in his fate alone I seek to know it. Con. And hast thou strength to bear it? art thou firm? For that which smites mine eye must smite thine ear. Val. (alarmed). Thou reck'nest then to look on dreadful things? Con. I may or may not; but with mind not braced In its full strength, seek not thy fate to know. Val. (after a hesitating pause of great agitation). I can bear all things but the dread uncertainty Of what I am to bear. Con. Then shall it be unto thee as thou wilt. [After some mysterious motions and muttering to himself, he turns his face towards the bottom of the stage, as if he had his eye steadfastly fixed upon some distant point; and continues so for some time without moving, whilst she stands, watching his countenance eagerly, with her face turned to the front of the stage. Val. (impatiently, after a pause). O! what dost thou behold? Con. Nay, nothing yet but the dark formless void. Be patient and attend.âI see him now: On the tower'd wall he stands: the dreadful battle Roars round him. Through dark smoke, and sheeted flames, And showers of hurtling darts, and hissing balls, He strides: beneath his sword falls many a foe: His dauntless breast to the full tide of battle He nobly gives. Still on through the dark storm Mine eye pursues him to his fate's high copeâ Val. His fate's high cope! merciful, awful heaven! [After a pause. O, wherefore dost thou pause? thine eyes roll terribly: What dost thou see? thou lookst on things most dreadful! O look not thus, but say what thou dost see! Con. I see a frowning chief, the crescent's champion, In bold defiance meet thy valiant lord. The fight is fierce and bloody.â Val. Again thou pausest yet more terribly.â Hast thou no utterance for what thou seest? O God! O God! thou lookst upon his death! [Clasping her hands violently. Dost thou not speak? wilt thou not answer me? Thou lookst upon his death! Con. I look on nothing, for thy frantic terrors Have broken the fabric of my air-shaped vision, And all is blank. Val. And will it not return to thee again? O fix thine eyes, and to it bend thy soul Intently, if it still may rise before thee, For thou hast made me frantic! Con. (after a pause, and fixing his eyes as before). The forms again returnâ The champions meet: the fight is fierce and terrible: The fateful stroke is given: and Constantineâ Val. Merciful heaven! Con. And Constantine lays the proud crescent low. Val. (pausing for a moment as if to be assured that she has heard right, and then holding up her hands in ecstasy). It is! it is! O words of bliss!âThou seest it! My Constantine lays the proud crescent low! Thou lookst upon it truly; and their forms Before thee move, e'en as the very forms Of living men? Con. Even so. Val. O blessed sight! It is not witch'ry's spell, but holy spirits Sent from a gracious heav'n that shapes such forms; And be it lawless or unhallow'd deem'd, Here will I kneel in humble gratitude. Con. (preventing her from kneeling). No, no, this must not be: attend again: There's more behind. Val. Ha! sayst thou more behind? Or good or evil? Con. Mixed I ween: 'tis still in darkness lapp'd. Val. In darkness let it rest: I've heard enough, I would not look upon thine eyes again, And in my fancy shape thy unseen sights, For all that e'erâIs that which lies behind A far extended vision? [Pausing anxiously. Thou wilt not answer meâwell, rest it so. But yet, O forward look for one short year, And say who then shall be this city's lord. Con. Thy husband and thy lord, most might dame, Shall at that period be this city's lord. Val. Then I am satisfied. Thou hast my thanks, My very grateful thanks. There is thy recompense, And this too added. [Giving him a purse, and then a ring from her hand. We shall meet again In happier days, when the proud crescent's low, And thou shalt have a princely recompense. [Turning to her attendants as she goes away. Come, Lucia; come, my friends; the storm will pass, And we shall smile in the fair light of heaven In happier days. [Exit, followed by her attendants. Con. (looking at his reward). Good sooth, this almost smites against my heart; But goes she not far happier than she came? Have I not earn'd it well? Re-enter Petronius. Pet. Thou hast well earn'd it. What! harbour such poor scruples in a breast So exercised in a trade like this? Fy on't! But if thy conscience is so nice, Know that thou hast in all good likelihood Predicted truly; and her lord and husband Shall be still, as thou sayst, this city's lord. Con. How so? Pet. Hast thou not skill enough to guess? Much has the Sultan of Valeria heard; And, with the future beauties of his palace, His fancy, in the most distinguish'd rank, Already places her. Thou wilt ere long, I can foretel by certain fleeting shapes Which at this moment dance before mine eyes, A favour'd, famous, courtly prophet be. My little Ella too, taught by my art, May play, perhaps, her part; and so together We'll amicably work.âMay it not be? Put up thy gold and say it is well earn'd. Con. It must be had, and therefore must be earn'd, Falsely or honestly.âDoes Constantine, As speaks this morning's rumour, send again Another embassy to Mahomet With terms of peace? Pet. He does, my friend: already in the palace He, and his band of self-devoted fools, Deliberate on it. Thou, at no great risk, Mayst prophecy the issue of their counsels. Con. I have adventured upon bolder guessing. Pet. Excepting that slight aid from Genoa, Which by the master of a coasting vessel. Kept secretly on watch, I am inform'd Is now almost within sight of the coast, No hope remains to Constantine. And this Shall not deceive him long; for I've despatch'd, In a swift-sailing skiff, a trusty agent, Who shall with costly bribes and false reports Deter their boldness from all desp'rate efforts To force a passage to the block'd-up port: A thing, Rodrigo's bold success alone Hath taught us to believe e'en possible. Con. Thanks for your information, my good lord: I'll profit by it. Pet. But use it prudently. And so good day. Well thrive thy trade, and all good luck attend us. [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. An apartment in the imperial palace, with a view through a grand arched door of another apartment, in which are discovered Constantine, Othus, Justiniani, Rodrigo, and others, arising from a council table. They enter and come forward. Con. Well, my brave friends, I to your care intrust This last attempt by honourable treaty To gain peace from the foe. Heav'n bless your efforts! Jus. All that strict honour will permit to us Shall be most truly done, imperial lord, And one step farther on we cannot go. Con. Had I wish'd more than this, Justiniani, I had sent other ministers.â Heav'n bless your efforts, brave ambassadors, And make you wise as brave! If we succeed not, As much I fear, it is my earnest wish, Ere the grand push that shall our fate decide, To meet you all in blessed charity, And join with you, perhaps, in the last rites Of Christian worship that within our walls Shall e'er be celebrated. Othus. Your wish shall be fulfill'd: we all desire it. Con. I thank you. In an hour hence be prepared To set out for the Sultan's camp. So brothers, Good day, and all good favour! [Exeunt all but Constantine and Othus. Con. (to Othus, as he is about to go after the others). Wilt thou go also, Othus? Othus. Not if your highness does command my stay. Con. Ah, gentle friend! I do no more command! But this distresses thee. Well, gen'rous man, Thou art commanded. [Pointing to a seat, and they both sit. Here, by thy friendly side, I'll give my heart a little breathing space; For oh! the gen'rous love of these brave men, Holding thus nobly to my sinking fate, Presses it sorely. From thee nor from myself can I conceal The hopeless state in which I am beset. No foreign prince a brother's hand extends In this my hour of need; no Christian state Sends forth its zealous armies to defend This our begirded cross: within our walls, Though with th' addition of our later friends, I cannot number soldiers e'en sufficient To hold a petty town 'gainst such vast odds. I needs must smile and wear a brow of hope, But with thee, gentle Othus, I put off All form and seeming; I am what I am, A weak and heart-rent man.âWilt thou forgive me? For I in truth must weep. Othus. Yes, unrestrained weep, thou valiant soul With many a wave o'er-ridden! Thou striv'st nobly Where hearts of sterner stuff perhaps had sunk: And o'er thy fall, if it be so decreed, Good men will mourn, and brave men will shed tears, Kindred to those which now thou shedst. Thy name Shall in succeeding ages be remember'd, When those of mighty monarchs are forgot. Con. Deceive me not; thy love deceiveth thee. Men's actions to futurity appear But as th' events to which they are conjoin'd Do give them consequence. A fallen state, In age and weakness fall'n, no hero hath; For none remain behind unto whose pride The cherish'd mem'ry of his acts pertains. O no, good Othus, fame I look not for. But to sustain in heav'n's all-seeing eye, Before my fellow men, in mine own sight, With graceful virtue and becoming pride, The dignity and honour of a man, Thus station'd as I am, I will do all That man may do, and I will suffer allâ My heart within me cries, that man can suffer. [Starting up with vehemence, and holding up both hands firmly clenched. Shall low-born men on scaffolds firmly tread, For that their humble townsmen should not blush And shall I shrink? No, by the living God! I will not shrink, albeit I shed these tears. Othus. To be in toils and perils, any in sufferings, With th' applauding sympathy of men Upon his side, is to the noble mind A state of happiness beyond the bliss Of calm inglorious ease. Con. O no, good Othus! thou misjudgest of me. I would, God knows, in a poor woodman's hut Have spent my peaceful days, and shared my crust With her who would have cheer'd me, rather far Than on this throne; but, being what I am, I'll be it nobly. Othus. Yes, thou wilt be it nobly, spirit as brave As e'er wore CÃ¦sar's name! Con. (smiling sorrowfully). Yes, there is cause for me; there is good cause. But for those valiant men, link'd in my fate, Who have in other lands their peaceful homes And dear domestic ties, on whom no claim Lays its strong holdâalas! what cause have they? What is their recompense? Fame is not mine; And unto themâO this doth press my heart! A heart surcharged with many cares, and press'd With that besides, which more than allâwith that Which I have wrestled withâwhich I have striv'nâ With that which comes between me and myselfâ The self that as a Christian and a man I strongly strove to beâ Othus. You have before some secret cause of trouble Hinted in broken words: will not your highness Unto a faithful friendâ Con. (turning away from him). No, no, good Othus! Sometimes I dream like a distracted man, And nurse dark fancies. Power and lawless willâ Defenceless beautyâMahometâValeriaâ Shape out of these wild words whate'er thou wilt, For I can say no more. Othus. Alas, I know it all! Con. And yet why should it thus disturb my mind? A thought, perhaps, that in no other breast Hath any shelter found.âIt is my weakness: I am ashamed of it.âI can look On my short fated span and its dark bound: I can, God strength'ning me, my earthly task Close as becomes a king; and, being closed, To that which in this world's tumultuous stage Shall happen after it, I am as nothing. Othus. Alas! my royal master, do not thus To racking thoughts give way! are there not means To free you from this pain, if you to use them Have courage? Let the empress be convey'd Far from these walls. It is a cruel remedy, But it will give you peace. Con. I did attempt it, but she has so closely Entwined herself upon meâO, my friend, It needs must pass! I in th'unconscious grave Shall be at rest. Othus. But does she know the nature of your fears? Con. O no! she does not! from that hateful subject, As from a hideous serpent, still with her I've kept aloof.âAlas! what can I do? I could as well into her noble heart Thrust the barb'd dart, as tell her what I fear. Othus. Perhaps she still, as from the common horrors Of a sack'd town, may be conjured to flee. And here she comes: be it at least attempted. Enter Valeria, Lucia, and attendant Ladies. Val. (to Constantine). I come to claim thy promise: one short hour, A hasty sunbeam through the cloud's dark skirt, Thou giv'st to me, and I must claim my right. Thy friends, too, ere they go, shall be my guests; I have brought powerful suitors to assist me. [Pointing to her ladies. Ha! what disturbs thee? how is this, my love? Thy face is changed and troubledâWhat new causeâ Con. O, no new cause! one that has much disturb'd me. Val. And one to me unknown? Con. Speak to her, Othus! Othus. By many various ills and cares oppress'd, Your royal lord is still most closely touch'd With that which does your weal regard. What fate May, in a storm-ta'en city, of dire sights And horrid cruelties, have in reserve, If such the city's doom, who can foresee? O, let him then his painful station hold, Gen'rous Valeria! from one care relieved, His heaviest care, the thought of leaving thee The involved witness of such horrid things! Val. What wouldst thou say in this? Thinkst thou the ruin In which he perishes will have for me Or form or circumstances? It will be Th' upbreaking crash of all existing things, That undistinguish'd is, and felt but once. Othus, thou talkst like an unskilful sage: It was not thus thy master bade thee speak. Con. Valeria, hard necessity compels us. I have already safe asylum sought For the last tender remnant of our race, That something might from this dire wreck be saved, And shall I not for theeâ Val. No; I am nothing But what I am for thee! When that is finish'dâ Con. Ah, my Valeria, but that will not finish! Thou still mayst be for meâthou still mayst bear Honour'd memorial amongst living men Of him who was thy lord.âGood Lucia, aid me, And gentle Servia, too, and all of you! [To the ladies. Cling round your mistress with your soothing love, And say that in a foreign land you'll be The faithful friends and soothers of her woe, Where ev'ry virtuous heart will bear to her The kindred ties of holiest sympathy. Say ye will be with her in kindliest zeal: Ye will not leave her? Lucia and the other ladies. No, we'll never leave her! [Gathering round her affectionately. Most dear and royal mistress, whilst life holds, In whate'er land, in whate'er state you are, We'll never leave you. Val. I know it well: thanks to your gen'rous love! But yet forbear, nor thus beset me round! [Putting them gently from her, and fixing her eyes upon Constantine. O, Paleologus! hast thou for me In fancy shaped a world and an existence Where thou art not? [Running to him and falling on his neck. Here is my world, my life, my land of refuge, And to no other will I ever flee. Here still is light and hope; turning from this, All else is round me as a yawning tomb. Con. My dearest love! my gen'rous honour'd love! My sweet Valeria! thou distractest me; But have thy way, for I can urge no more. Let dark fate come: I will abide its worst. Val. Nay, say not dark; there is a hope within me; 'Tis sure, 'tis strong, it cannot be deceitful. [A signal heard from without. Hark! Hark! a signal! (Voices are heard calling without.) Ships are in sight! supplies and warlike aid! Heaven sends us aid! Val. (holding up her hands). O blessed sound! there is salvation in it. Heaven sends us aid! [Voices again call out as before, and the signal is repeated. Again the blessed sound! And here Rodrigo comes, wearing a face Of welcome tidings. Enter Rodrigo. Succours, brave Rodrigo? Rod. Yes, ships from Genoa are now in sight, Bearing, no doubt, brave aid, if to the port They can make good their entrance. (All, except Constantine.) Good heaven be bless'd. Con. And says Rodrigo âif?â [Shaking his head. Val. Nay, fear not, they will enter; with them comes Another brave Rodrigo; through barr'd adamant, Did it oppose them, they will force their way. Rod. If they have but one jot of manhood in them, They'll do all possible things. Val. Ay, and all things are possible! Con. In truth, thou talkst with such exulting confidence, Thou almost temptest me to grasp at hope. [Voices call out as before, and a signal from the towers. Val. The animating sound! Come, come! O, come! And o'er the blue waves hail the blessed sight! [Runs out exultingly, every one following her with animated alacrity. ACT III. SCENE I. The Turkish camp; the tent of Mahomet, who is discovered sitting alone in the eastern manner, with a great sheet of parchment spread out before him, which he is considering attentively. Mah. (after tracing some lines with a pen or pencil). Ho, Osmir! art thou here? Enter Osmir. Come hither, vizir; follow with thine eye The various dispositions of this plan Which for our grand attack I here have traced. God and the Prophet being on our side, That mingled broil of fierce and dreadful fight, Which shall not cease till from the list of nations This eastern empire, with its long told line Of paltry CÃ¦sars, be expunged and blank, Shall not be long delay'd. Osmir. All things must yield unto the towering spirit And comprehensive genius of your highness. Permit your slave. [Looking over the plan. Conceived, indeed, with deep and wondrous skill! But, mighty lord, if that a worm may speak, Your van, methinks, is of a motley class, The vile refuse and garbage of the camp; Are Mussulmen led on in glory's path By such as these? Mah. (smiling fiercely). No; but brave Mussulmen o'er such as these May step to glory's path. Garbage, I trust, Is good enough for filling ditches up. Some thousand carcases, living and dead, Of those who first shall glut the en'my's rage, Push'd in, pell-mell, by those who press behind, Will rear for us a bridge to mount the breach Where ablest engineers had work'd in vain. Osmir. This did escape my more contracted thoughts. And here your highness stations Georgian troops: Are they sure men in such important service? Mah. (smiling again). Ay, sure as death; here is my surety for them. Seest thou what warriors in the rear are placed, With each a cord and hatchet in his hand? Those grizly hangmen, in their canvas sleeves, Fight for me better than an armed band Of Christian knights full cap-Ã -pie. Look o'er it: Something, perchance, may have escaped my thoughts. Osmir (after again examining it). No; every thing is consummately plann'd.â But, mighty sultan, this old officer, Whom you have station'd here with your new troops, Is not to be relied on. Mah. How so, Osmir? Osmir. It is suspected that he has received The en'my's gold; one thing, at least, is certain, He has had private meetings with the foe. Mah. What! art thou sure of this?âSend for him quickly. The fool 'mid blocks and bowstrings has so long His base head tott'ring worn, he thinks, no doubt, It needs must be his own. Send for him quickly, And see that which is needful done upon him. [Drawing the pen sternly across the name on the plan. There; from the world of living things I blot him; Another takes his place. (Giving a paper to Osmir.) These are the usual orders for the night; Assemble thou the sev'ral officers, And give to each his own particular charge. Osmir. Your slave obeys. [Exit. Mah. (alone, after musing for a little while). Have I done well to give this hoary vet'ran Who has for thirty years fought in our wars, To the death-cord unheard? [Sternly, after pausing a short space. I have done well. In my disguised rounds, but two nights since, List'ning at his tent-door, I heard him speak Words that methought approach'd to slight esteem Of my endowments and capacity. Yes, he is guilty. [After walking up and down several times he opens another scroll. But I will fear no treason: here is that On which I may rely. In mortal man I have no trust; they are all hollow slaves, Who tremble and detest, and would betray. But on the fates, and the dark secret powers, So say those sure unerring calculations Of deep astrology, I may depend. [Sitting down again, and considering the scroll. Ay, it must needs be so: this constellation In close conjunction with the warrior's star, Traced back in magic numbers three times three, And nine times nine, and added three again, Unto the hour of my nativity, Makes it infallible. Here have I mark'd it With my own science, num'ral, learn'd, and sure. Ha! ha! your foolish Christians now believe Men's future fortunes are by wizards seen, In airy forms pourtray'd, like mimic shows, And trust thereto with fond simplicity. [Othoric, who about the middle of this speech has made his appearance from behind the curtain of the tent, disguised like a Turk, but without a turban, now, stealing alose up to Maiiomet, lifts up his dagger to strike. What do I hear? Othoric. It is thy fate, blind Turk, uncalculated. [Striking. Mah. (parrying the blow with his sheathed scimitar, which he afterwands draws). Ho! help without! treason and parricide! Ho! guards without, I say! [Guards rush in, and Othoric is seized, after defending himself desperately. Mah. (to Othoric). Who art thou? What dark tyrant set thee on To do this murderous and horrid deed? Othoric. And thinkst thou such deeds horrid?âBut I came To act and not to speak. Mah. Say rather, villain, to be acted on. Do racks and burning iron please thee well That thou shouldst earn them with such desperate pains. (To the Guards.) Stretch out his arms, and let me look on them. [Looking at his arms, and surveying him all over, he shrinks back as from a danger escaped, and then smiles grimly. There will be tough work on those sinewy limbs When they are dealt with. Lead the traitor off. I will give orders for his fate ere long. [To Othoric, who is about to speak. Thou shalt not speak: I hate thy horrible face. Lead him away! [Exeunt Othoric and Guards, met by Petronius and Marthon, who enter as they are going out. Pet. What prisoner is this they lead along? Mah. A dark assassin in my tent conceal'd, Whose daring hand e'en now aim'd at my life. Pet. (casting up his eyes to heaven). The life of great and godlike Mahomet! It makes my blood turn cold. Mar. I too am stunn'd, and tremble at the thought. Mah. Yes, all may tremble who in the dark purpose Have part or knowledge had. Pet. and Mar. (both alarmed). What means my lord? [Mahomet walks several times across the stage with angry strides, whilst they look fearfully upon one another, and then going sternly up to them. Mah. I know the base transactions of last night: Ye stuff'd my gold into the dirty palms Of those who shook their torches in the air, And cried long live brave Paleologus. I know it all: think ye with upcast looks, And mumm'ry such as this, to blind mine eyes? Pet. (falling on his knees). As there's a God in heav'n, to you, great Sultan! We have been true! [Marthon kneels also. Mah. Up, crouching slaves! when men, so bred as you are, Thus lowly kneel, my very soul abhors them. Pet. Your death, great monarch, were to Paleologus Triumph and safety, but to us swift ruin. Mar. And shall suspicions so improbable Fall upon us, who in your secret service Have dangers braved, and from your hands alone Look for the recompense? Pet. If we last night have fail'dâ Mah. (stamping with his foot). I will not hear you! Enter Osmir. Osmir, knowst thou this horrible attempt? Osmir. I do, great prince, and bless the prophet's arm That has preserved you. What base enemy Has arm'd the desp'rate villain? Mah. Petronius here and his smooth Grecian friend Throw accusation on the emperor. Osmir. This moment in your camp there is arrived An embassage of his most honour'd friends, Sent by the emperor to treat of peace. Mah. At this unlikely hour? Osmir. Yes, time now presses, and, as I should guess, The hopes of succour from those friendly vessels That vainly have attempted through your fleets To force a passage, raising short-lived joy Full soon extinguish'd, has to this late hour Delay'd their coming. Hope gone, they now are humbled suitors. Here, Within your power, you have the chiefest men Of the brave friends on whom he most depends; This does not look like preconcerted plots Of secret murder, at this very hour To be attempted Mah. No, Osmir, there is reason in thy words. Osmir. But if your highness thinks it is expedient, I will straightway arrest them. Mah. (after hesitating). No; they are valiant men, and do as such Claim honour from a valiant foe. Go say, That by the morning's dawn they shall have audience; The open camp, with wide-mouth'd cannon cloth'd, And all my lofty garniture of war, Shall be my hall of state. Secure those men Until my farther orders! [Pointing to Petronius and Marthon, and exit, followed by Osmir. Remain Petronius and Marthon guarded. 1st guard. Come on, my masters, we'll conduct you safely. Mar. (to Petronius). Is it to plunge me in this dreadful gulf That your cursed lessons have seduced my youth? Pet. Upbraid me not. I have not for myself A better fate reserved. But we are noble, And of high lineage; fear not, for the Sultan Will still respect us. 2d guard. Ay, so belike he will; your noble heads May with the royal scimitar be sever'd, If he is much inclined to honour you. Some men ere now, in other Sultans' days, Have been so honour'd. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An open space in the camp, with the Janizaries and Turkish troops drawn up in order. Cannon and warlike engines seen mixed with the tents. A flourish of trumpets; enter Mahomet, with Osmir and his train, and places himself in a chair of state near the front of the stage. Another flourish of trumpets, and enter Othus, Justiniani, and Rodrigo, with a small train of attendants, walking slowly up the stage. Mah. (to Osmir, as they come forward). These men approach us with a hardy step, Nor wear the suppliant's humbled brow. Come they To sue or to command us? [To Othus and the other deputies, who make obeisance to him. You are permitted to declare your errand. If your hard-lesson'd chief, more prudent grown, Will now resign his proud imperial city Into the hands to whom high heaven's decree, And power on earth resistless, soon shall give it, I will receive that which he cannot hold With grace and favour. Othus. High heaven's decrees are known to mortal man But in th' event fulfill'd; and for earth's power, The cannon-flanked cohorts, and wide front Of far extended numbers, show it not To him, who in the small and secret fortress, E'en of one brave man's breast, more help discovers, Oft in th' astounding hour of the storm's pitch, Than in an armed host. Imperial Constantine Will live or die within his city's walls As may become their master.âNevertheless, He will so far to hard necessityâ Mah. I hear no more: your words are in effectual, And fall as powerless as the ruffian's sword, Whom now, within my tent, your royal master, Compell'd no doubt by hard necessity, Has hired to murder me. Just. (stepping boldly forward). Sultan, thou sittest where thou safely mayst Say what thou wilt, therefore of all mankind Thou most art bound to say but what is meet. Put those accusing words that thou hast utter'd Into the mouth of any other Turk, Wore he a giant's form, for in your camp I know that such there be, and I will prove it, With this good soldier's arm, a cursed falsehood. Othus (to Justiniani, pulling him back). Thou art not wise.âGreat Sultan, hear me speak. If any base attack upon your life Has been attempted, let the murd'rous villain, If still he breathes, be here before us brought. In presence of your highness we will question him: Perchance he will confess what secret foe Has armed his daring hand. Mah. (after giving orders to a guard in dumb show, who immediately goes out). Your suit is granted. These men speak boldly, vizir. [Aside to Osmir. Osmir (aside to Mahomet). They shrink not from the proof. Enter Othoric fettered and guarded. Mah. (to Othoric). As thou mayst hope a mitigated doom, I here command thee that thou truly answer Whate'er those Roman deputies demand. Othoric. I do not hope a mitigated doom, And therefore, Sultan, cannot be commanded: But if this brave man here will question me, [Pointing to Rodrigo. For in his presence I do feel my spirit To manhood's height braced up, I'll truly answer, Though every word did in my sinews fix The burning pincer's tooth. Rod. Ha! Othoric art thou not? the strong Hungarian? Othoric (smiling). Ay, thou rememberest my nameâI thank theeâ It pleases me to think thou'lt ne'er forget it. Ask what thou wilt, and I will answer thee; Bid me do what thou wilt, and I will do it, Barring the hind'rance of these chains. Rod. Thanks to thee! Then whatsoe'er the Sultan asks of thee, Answer him truly. He will point his questions Where his suspicion falls. Othoric. I will obey. Mah. (sternly). Who hired thee, thou bold and hard-brow'd villain, Such horrid deed to do? Othoric. I have been twice hired, mighty Mahomet, To do fell deeds, in which I've lack'd performance. Mah. And who first hired thee? Othoric. Thyself. Mah. Base traitor! Dar'st thou belie me to my very face? Othoric. That I belie thee not be this my token; My hire was given to me by Petronius, Told from a sable bag, on whose seal'd mouth Thy scimitar and crescent were impress'd. Othus. Petronius! Othoric. Yes, that smooth, subtle Greek. Mah. He hired thee not to take the life of Constantine? Othoric. True; I was hired for wasteful insurrection, Not for delib'rate murder. Though most wretched, A stranger, griped by hard necessity, The price he gave me ne'er had bought this arm To such an act. Mah. And who did hire thee for this second deed, Which thou must needs delib'rate murder call? Othoric. 'Twas Constantine. Just. Thou liest, foul, artful villain! Mah. Peace I command! ye shall not interrupt him. 'Twas Constantine that hired thee? Othoric. Yes, great Sultan! But not with gold, and he himself, I ween, Unconscious of the act. Mah. What did he bribe thee with? Othoric. With that which does but seldom prove the means Of like corruptionâgen'rous admiration Of noble manly virtue. I beheld him, Like a brave stag encompass'd by base curs, And it did tempt me.âOther bribe than this Have I had none; and to no mortal ear Did I reveal my purpose. [Mahomet puts his hand on his forehead and seems disturbed, whilst the deputies hold up their hands exultingly. Rod. (to Othoric). O for a galley mann'd with such as thou art, Therewith to face a hundred armed ships, Creatured with meaner life! Yet thou must die, brave heart! yet thou must die. Thou hast done that which in no circumstance Man's hand may do, and therefore thou must perish. But I'll remember thee: thy name is Othoric: I will remember thee. Osmir (to Mahomet, who covers his face and seems disturbed, after a pause). Your highness gives no orders to your slave Touching the prisoner. Mah. (uncovering his face angrily). His crime is plain: death be his instant doom. Osmir. And in what mode? or simple or with pains? Mah. Distract me not. Othoric. Vizir, be not so hasty. I bear with me what will redeem my life, And gain the Sultan's pardon. Osmir. Ah! thinkest thou to gain him with that bribe Which Constantine gave thee? [Shaking his head. Othoric. No, not with that. I wear upon this arm, A potent band, with subtile magic wrought, That, wheresoe'er 'tis on my body rubb'd With mutter'd words which I alone do know, Maketh the part firm and invulnerable To sword, or bullet, or the arrow's pointâ To all offensive things. Believe me not, But see the proof.âRelieve mine arms, I pray, That I may show this wonder. Mah. Unlock his fetters: if he tamper with us, His tortures are enhanced. Othoric (to the guard who stands next him, after he has been unfettered, and at the same time uncovering his left arm). Young Turk, thou wearst a dagger by thy side: To show that I am made as other men, Of flesh and blood as soft and sensitive, When with no charm secured, thrust it, I pray thee, Into this nerved flesh. Nay, do not shrink, For I shrink not. Mah. Do it, thou timid slave! [The guard slightly wounds Othoric 's arm with the point of the dagger. Othoric. You see it is an arm of flesh and blood; And so you'll find my body in all parts, Thrust where you will.âBut mark me; wheresoe'er I rub this band, your weapons have no power. [Opening his breast and rubbing it with a bracelet which he takes from his arm, at the same time muttering some mystical words to himself. Now try if e'er the stoutest arm amongst you, With pike, or spear, or keenly-temper'd blade, Can pierce this charmed breast. Mah. (to an attendant). Attempt it, brawny slave; thine arm is strong. (To Osmir.) Give him a stronger weapon.âNow the proof! [The slave, receiving a sword from Osmir, runs with full force upon Othoric, who falls down, pierced through the breast, and utters a convulsive laugh as he expires. Rod. (exultingly). O, bravely done, thou spirit of true proof! Just. Yes, nobly has he shunn'd the degradation Of slavish punishment. Othus. It was a lofty mind in a rude state Of wild distorted virtue; 'cross the fancy It stalks a gloomy, dark, gigantic shade, Angel or fiend we know not. Mah. (aside to himself, turning gloomily away). And Constantine is served by men like these! Othus (to Mahomet). Seeing that of this crime our royal master Doth clearly stand acquitted, by your word, Most mighty Mahomet, we are permitted To state his wishes. Mah. No, ambassadors; I have already said I hear no more Unless ye yield the city.âLeave ye have In safety to return.âYou and your chief O'er a volcano's thinly-bridged gulf Have ta'en your stand, and the dire crash is near. Othus. And with our chief in that tremendous ruin, If it must be, we will sink lovingly. Just. We will sink honourably. Rod. We will sink gloriously. Ay, by heaven's light, And cheerly too, great Sultan! [Passing the body of Othoric as they turn to go away. Thou noble wreck, thou wast rigg'd gallantly! [Exeunt Othus, Justiniani, Rodrigo, and their attendants. Mah. (coming forward to the front of the stage, and standing for some time in a thoughtful posture much disturbed). And Constantine is served by men like these! Osmir (to slaves, pointing to the body of Othoric). Take up the carcase of that savage ruffian, And stick it on a stake for vulture's food. Mah. (turning round angrily). No, reptiles, let it have a soldier's grave! Osmir. This is exceeding mercy; ne'ertheless, Your orders, mighty prince, shall be obey'd By those who are as dust beneath your feet. Mah. Yes, I do know that I shall be obey'd By those who areâI am begirt with slaves. [Turning away, and stamping on the ground as he walks. My enemy is served by men like these! I will give orders with all pressing speed That now my grand attack forthwith be made: What next may be attempted by such foes Who may divine? Osmir. That is the safest counsel. [Exeunt; Mahomet tossing his arms and muttering us he goes out. ACT IV. SCENE I. An outpost belonging to the Turkish camp, with a view of the city of Constantinople in the background seen in the dimness of cloudy moonlight. Enter several Turkish soldiers by different ways, meeting one another. 1st Turk. Ho! who are ye? our friends? 2d Turk. I know thy voice. 1st Turk. Yes, we are friends; but let us separate, And gain our tents as quickly as we may: For now through all the camp the busy stir Of warlike preparation is begun; And ere the morning dawn, each armed Turk Must hold him ready for th' approaching day Of havock, blood, and spoil. Come, let us on! 3d Turk. Yes; but, good comrades, do once more look back, And see, through the wan night, those buildings gleam With the last Christian fires that e'er shall burn Within those circling walls. 2d Turk. Ay, there the Prophet has prepared our rest. There soon, midst heap'd-up spoils, and the wild wailings Of fetter'd beauty, in our new-won homes, We'll cast our reeking scimitars aside, And lay us down in soft and lordly sloth. Comrades, it is an animating sight. But quickly let us gain our tents.âHush! hush! What Turk comes prowling this way, and alone? It looks like Mahomet. 1st Turk. It is the Sultan on his nightly rounds, Disguised; let us avoid him. 3d Turk. I'd rather cross a tiger on my way; For, as the humour hits, it may be fatal To know or not to know him. At the best We shall be deem'd but lawless stragglers here: Let us all separate and gain our tents. [Exeunt hastily, all by different ways. Enter Mahomet disguised, followed at a distance by the Vizir. Mah. (alone, after walking thoughtfully from the bottom of the stage, whilst Osmir remains in the background). What boots this restless wish? 'tis all blank silence On that for which my greedy ears still watch. There's ne'er a Turk, who, o'er his ev'ning pipe, Will not far rather talk of daring feats By petty robbers done, than all the fame And grand achievements of his sov'reign lord. 'Tis cheerless silence all! Dull stupid race! They arm them for to-morrrow's fight, 'tis true, With much alacrity, and talk of conquest, Carnage, and spoils; but for their Sultan's name, The name of Mahomet, through all the camp I've scarcely heard its sound. Nay, once I heard it In accents harsh pronounced, but as to listen I nearer drew, my steps the speaker scared, And all was into fearful silence hush'd. Their Sultan's name!âPest seize the stupid slaves! O, Constantine! it is not thus thy soldiers Do arm themselves for thee. Ho, Osmir! art thou near me? Osmir (advancing). Yes, my lord. Mah. Hast thou been list'ning too? Osmir. Yes, Sultan; and I find your Mussulmen Their arms preparing for to-morrow's battle, Beneath your royal standard most determin'd To conquer or to die. They under your approving eye will fight, As in the sunshine of propitious heaven. Mah. Yes, I am in their minds full truly grown A thing of gen'ral attributes composedâ A heaven of sunshine or of lowering storms: But as a man and leader, in whom live The mental and corporeal qualities Of MahometâPest seize the stupid slaves! Enter Petronius and Marthon muffled up in cloaks. But who comes here? twice on my rounds already Those men have cross'd me: am I known to them? By the great Prophet they shall bear their secret Where secrets are secure!âHo! stop slaves there! Stop, in the Sultan's name! [Running upon them furiously, and lifting his scimitar over the head of Petronius, who immediately discovers himself. Pet. Crush not a worm, my lord. Mah. A worm indeed! What treason brings ye here, Skulking, thus muffled up in dark disguise? Have I not warn'd ye both that ye do live Beneath mine iron power in strictest faultlessness? For that when ye are found but to transgress The galling limits of imposed duty Even a hair's breadth, there abideth you A recompense more dreadful than torn slaves, Writhing in horrid ecstasy, e'er knew. Beware: ye have no power to serve me now, And unsuccessful traitors are most hateful. Pet. It is, great Mahomet, to make amends For unsuccessful services, that here Thou findst us, on our way within the city To gain for thee some useful information Against to-morrow's push. Still in our power Some little aid remains. Mah. If thou sayst true, return to me again, Leading thy beauteous daughter in thy hand, Ere two hours pass, who shall within my tent A pledge remain for thy suspicious faith Until the city's ta'en.âBegone, I charge you, And answer not again. [Exeunt Petronius and Marthon. Are all my orders issued for the morrow? To each respective officer assign'd His task and station? and my rearward troops, My axe and cord-men, they are not forgotten? Osmir. No, please your highness, nothing is forgotten. And by the early dawnâ [A mixture of confused distant sounds heard from the city. Mah. What sounds are these? Osmir. Hast thou forgot we are so near the city? It is the murm'ring night sounds of her streets, Which the soft breeze wafts to thine ear, thus softly Mix'd with the chafings of the distant waves. Mah. (eagerly). And let me listen too! I love the sound! Like the last whispers of a dying enemy [Listening. It comes to my pleased ear. Spent art thou, proud imperial queen of nations, And thy last accents are upon the wind. Thou hast but one voice more to utter; one Loud, frantic, terrible, and then art thou Amongst the nations heard no more. List! list! I like it well! the lion hears afar Th' approaching prey, and shakes his bristling mane, And lashes with his tail his tawny sides, And so hear I this city's nightly sound. Osmir. It is indeed a rich and noble conquest Which heaven unto its favour'd warrior gives. Mah. Yes, Osmir; I shall wear a conqu'ror's name, And other ages shall of Mah'met speak, When these dumb slaves are crumbling in the dust. But now the night wears on, and with the dawn Must the grand work begin. Yet one thing still remains; I must remind thee That to my gen'ral orders this be added:â Silent shall be the march; nor drum, nor trump, Nor clash of arms, shall to the watchful foe Our near approach betray; silent and soft, As the pard's velvet foot on Libya's sands, Slow stealing with crouch'd shoulders on her prey. Osmir. I have already given the strictest orders. Mah. Then all is well: go where thy duty calls. In the meanwhile I'll snatch an hour of rest, And dream, perhaps, that lovely Grecian dames, Even with a crowned beauty in their band, Are lowly bent to kiss my purple feet. [A distant bell heard from the city. What deep and distant bell is this which sounds So solemnly on the still air of night? Osmir. It comes from St. Sophia's lofty dome, Where Constantine, with his small band of friends, As I have learnt, should at this hour assemble. To join together in religious rites Of solemn preparation for to-morrow, Which they regard as their last day of life, And this as their last act of social brotherhood. Mah. Brave men! do they so meet? [Pausing. But it must be. Why should it move me? Heaven decrees their doom: I act by high commission, though for instruments I have but these dumb slaves. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A pillared aisle or open space in the church of St. Sophia, with other parts of the church seen in perspective. The great bell heard. Enter Heugho, met by an inferior priest. Priest. Thou com'st before thy master and his friends: How far are they behind? Heugho. Not many paces. [Bell sounds again. Priest. Wherefore didst thou start? Heugho. It smote mine ear most strange and dolefully. Is there soul in its sound which sadly says, It is the last bell that shall Christians warn To holy rites within these fated walls? How many hundred years this sacred pavement Has with the tread of Christian feet been worn! And nowâHeaven's will be done! Priest. So must we say, if that our turn be come. We are a wicked and luxurious race, And we have pull'd this ruin on our heads. Heugho. But there are those who needs must fall beneath it, Whose noble worth deserved a better fate. Priest. Think ye the grand assault will be so soon? Heugho. 'Tis so believed: and see where now they come, In gen'rous love and brotherhood united, Who shall, perhaps, no more see evening's close, Or under social roof of living men E'er meet again. Priest. Nay, do not weep, good Heugho; For in that blessed place they shall be join'd Where great and good men meet.âBut I must haste To give my brethren notice. [Exit. Enter Constantine, with Othus, Rodrigo, Justiniani, and others of his friends, who walk with solemn steps and bareheaded towards the front of the stage, the great bell sounding for the last time as they advance. Constantine then stops, and stretching out his arm as if he wished to speak, they all gather respectfully round him. Con. My friends, there greatly presses on my heart Somewhat I've much desired to say to you, If a full heart will grant me so much voice. Othus. Then speak it, royal sire, we all attend With ears of love and most profound respect. Con. Thus station'd on a dark and awful verge, In company with you, my noble friends, I have desired, in this solemn act, To make my peace with God. But, on my soul, If any unforgiven wrong to man Yet rests, how shall I lift my hands to Him Who has made all men, and who cares for all, As children of one grand and wondrous house, Wherein the mightiest monarch of the earth Holds but a little nook? I have been one, placed on a giddy height Of seeming greatness, therefore liable, In nature's poor infirmity, to acts Of blind and foolish pride. I have been one In much real feebleness, upheld, defended, By voluntary aid and gen'rous zeal Of valiant strangers owing me no service; And therefore liable, in the mind's weakness, Its saddest weakness, to ungrateful thoughts Tinctured with jealousy. If towards you, My noble friends, I have contracted guilt, I trustâI knowâI begâwhat shall I say? Your gen'rous hearts to all your deeds of love Will add a last forgiveness. Othus. O no, most royal Constantine! to us And to all men thou'st ever worthy been, Noble and gracious; pardon at our hands Thou needest none. Omnes. O no, thou needest none! As we to thee have faithful followers been, Thou'st ever been to us a gen'rous lord. Con. Your love would make it so: would that, indeed, A voice within me seal'd its fair report! Alas! it doth not; therefore now indulge me. If there be one amongst you, unto whom, With dark forbidding brow, in a stern moment, I've given ungen'rous pain; one whose kind service I have with foolish and capricious humours More irksome made; one whose frank openness Of manly love, offer'd to me as man In gen'rous confidence, with heartless pride I coldly have repell'd; yea, if there be One of you all that ever from my presence I have with sadden'd heart unkindly sent, I here, in meek repentance, of him crave A brother's hand, in token of forgiveness. And be it in true charity stretch'd forth, As to a man of much infirmity, Who has with many trials been beset, Wounding ofttimes in bitterness of soul The love he should have honour'd. What! is there none that will to me hold out The palm of charity? Then I'll embrace you all, and, with eased heart Believe myself forgiven. [Embracing them all as they crowd affectionately to him, and coming last to Rodrigo. And thou, my bold Rodrigo, who canst brave The tempests when they rage, and onward bear, With the opposed strength of towering navies Black'ning before thee, com'st thou to my breast In soft forgiving love? I know thou dost. Rod. Ay, in that love that would forgive to thee The sum of all thy sins, though multiplied Ten thousand thousand fold.â That would do in thy serviceâO cursed limit! That there should be what to man's sinew'd strength, In all the burning zeal of righteous boldness, Impossible is. [Clenching his hands vehemently. Othus (to Rodrigo). Cease! dost thou not respect these holy walls? Rod. I do respect them, Othus; ne'er a head, Shorn to the scalp, doth bow itself more humbly Before heaven's throne than mine, albeit in truth My words unseemly are. Con. Come to my heart, my friend! He reigns above Who will forgive us both. [Embraces Rodrigo, and then observing Heugho, who has stood behind, not presuming to approach him with the rest. But there is one who stands from me aloof With modest backwardness, unto whose charity I must be debtor also. Worthy Heugho, Since earliest youth I from thy friendly hand Have daily kindly offices received, Proffer'd with love, exceeding far all duty Belonging to thy state; yet, ne'ertheless, I once, in a most vile and fretful mood, Vex'd with cross things, thine honour'd age forgot. Heugho. Oh, say not so, my dear and royal master. It breaks my heart that you should still remember. Con. Well, well, be not thus moved, my worthy Heugho, I know I am forgiv'n; but lay thy hand, Thine aged hand, upon thy master's head, And give him a last blessing. Thou art now Like to an ancient father with us grown, And my heart says that it will do me good. [Bowing his head, whilst Heugho, lifting up his aged hands over him, is unable to speak, but bursts into tears, and falls upon his master's neck. The band of friends close round and conceal them: afterwards they open to make way, and Constantine comes forward with a firm enlightened countenance. And now, my noble friends, it pleases me To think we all are knit in holy bands Of fellowship; prepared, in virtue's strength, Nobly to fight on earth, or meet in heaven. Othus. Yes, Constantine, we to each other will True brothers prove, and to our noble chief Devoted followers, whate'er betide. What say ye, valiant friends? Omnes. All, all of us! Con. I know you will, full well, I know you will. Oh, that on earth it had been granted me Your gen'rous love to've recompensed! alas! Ye can but share with meâ Omnes. No other recompense, But sharing fates with thee, our noble chief, Do we desire, and on thy royal hand Here will we seal it. Con. (eagerly preventing them as they are about to kneel and kiss his hands). Forbear! forbear! within these sacred walls Bend before worthless man the humble knee! Fy, let not such shame be! Am I your chief? then be it shown in this, That to the mighty Majesty of heaven I humbly bow, more lowly than ye all, And do, on your behalf, devoutly beg The blessing of our Master and our Sire. [Kneeling and bowing his head very low to the ground, then rising afterwards with dignified solemnity. Now to those sacred rites of our blest faith, In which the humble soul ennobled bows, In mem'ry of the dearest brothership That ever honour'd man, I lead you on, My noble brothers. [Exeunt Constantine, &amp;c., by another aisle, which may be supposed to lead to the altar of the church, whilst several priests are seen at a distance in their robes, as if waiting to receive them. SCENE III. A hall, or ante-room in the imperial palace. Enter Petronius and Marthon disguised. Pet. So far hath this well-counterfeited signet, And this disguise, befriended us: here stop: Whilst Constantine and his mad band are absent On their religious ceremony, here We will remain conceal'd until that Ella, Returning (for 'tis near her wonted time, As they have told us) from Valeria's chamber, Shall give us fair occasion.âRouse thee, Marthon; Thou seemst like one bereaved of all sense; What is the matter with thee? Mar. Nothing; but thus to pass with culprit feet Beneath the shade of night, these well-known courts, Which I so oft have trod in front of day, With the firm footsteps of an honest man, Doth make meâ Pet. Fy! thou art become a fool. Shake off such weakness: we're compell'd to this. We shall beneath the Sultan's iron sway, Disgraced from the late failure of our plots, Live like lash'd slaves, if the bewitching beauty Of my young Ella come not to our aid To bend his rugged nature. Strong in her, We shall not merely safe protection find, But highest favour and authority; And though by stealth I needs must bear her hence, Being my daughter, I, in nature's rightâ Mar. Hush! now I hear a lightly-sounding step. Draw back a little space. [They step aside, whilst Ella enters, and walks across the stage. Pet. (in a half voice, stealing softly up to her). Ella! Ella (starting). What voice is that which names me? Pet. Ella! Ella. Oh! 'tis the sound that I most dread to hear! Pet. Sayst thou so, Ella, of thy father's voice? Have my misfortunes, with the world's fair favour, Deprived me also of my only child? Ella. No, no! they have not: had misfortune only Cast its dark shade upon thee, I had loved thee And cherish'd thee in a lone desert, father! Butâbut thou artâ Pet. Ha! wherefore dost thou pause? What wouldst thou say? what is there in thy mind? Ella. Thoughts which I will not utterâOh, depart! Thou'rt not in safety. All men do condemn thee. Thou art not come for good.âOh, fly from hence! Ruin, and shame, and death abide thee here: Oh, fly, my wretched father! Pet. Yes I will fly, but thou shalt go with me; If not, I will remain and meet my fate. Ella. Good heaven forbid! thou'lt drive me to distraction. O misery! [Wrings her hands in great distress, whilst Marthon advances to Petronius with supplicating look. Pet. (to Marthon). Away! thou art a fool: we must be firm. (To Ella.) Wring not thy hands thus wildly, simple maid: Thou goest to be with me no wand'ring outlaw, But one in splendour greater than a queen: The favour'd mistress of the mighty Sultan. [Ella gives a loud shriek, and struggles to escape from him. Enter Rodrigo. Rod. Audacious villain! quit thy cursed hold, Or take death for thy pains. Ha! thou shrinkst back, and mufflest up thy face. Say who thou art, or through thy villain's heart I'll thrust this rapier. Ella (pulling Rodrigo back). Hold, I do beseech thee. For pity, hold! it is my wretched father. Rod. Wretched indeed! Ella. Ay, therefore pity him. Let him escape: he hath done me no harm. He is here as a fox in his last wiles, Who shelter seeks within the very kennel Of the roused pack: Oh, have some pity on him! He is my father. Rod. Sweet Ella, hang not thus upon mine arm: It hath no power to strike whom thou callst father, Shame as he is unto that honour'd name. But there are ties upon me, gentle maid: The safety and the interests of Constantine I am bound to defend: and shall a traitorâ Ella. Oh! oh! Rod. Fear not: our royal master is return'd From blessed rites of holiest charity With meekly chasten'd soul: whate'er his crimes He is in safetyâsafety as assured As thine own harmless self. Enter Constantine. Con. (to Rodrigo). Thou speakst with an unwonted earnestness; I've mark'd thy gestures; something moves thee much. Who are these strangers? [Turning to Petronius and Marthon, who, uncovering their faces, stand confessed before him. Ha! Marthon and Petronius! What new treason Is now on foot, that hereâbut judge I harshly? Ye are, perhaps, struck with the circumstances Of these most solemn times, repentant grown, And if ye be, in a good hour ye come; I am myself a wean'd and pardon'd man. Marthon, thou once wast wont to speak the truth; What brought you hither? Mar. Most gracious prince, with no repentant mind We hither came; but one of us, at least, Shall hence depart with a heart deeply smitten. Con. Confess then what new treason ye devised. Ella. No treason; none to thee, most royal Constantine. For me he came, arm'd with a parent's right, To bear me to the haughty Sultan's camp, To live in queenly state. But, Oh protect me! Let me remain and die with those I love In decent maiden pride. Retain me here, But pardon him: no treason brought him hither. Con. Petronius, has thy daughter told me true; Was this thine errand? Pet. (approaching Constantine). Yes, most gracious prince. Con. Off then, disgrace to nature and to manhood! Wouldst thou to shameful and degrading slavery Betray thy virtuous child? Say thou cam'st hither To thrust i' the dark thy dagger through my heart, And I will call thee sinless. Pet. Wherefore this stern and bitter execration? I came to place her but a few hours sooner, Saved from th' approaching storm, where your high dames, Yea, with their royal mistress at their head, Full shortly shall be placed. Con. Detested wretch! what fiend has whisper'd to thee Such hideous thoughts? man durst not utter them. Pet. Man might, at least, surveying the position And aspect of these times, in his own mind This plain and shrewd conjecture form. But not On such loose bottom do I ground my words; Mah'met himself hath sworn that your Valeria Shall at the head of his most favour'd wivesâ Con. Hold thy detested tongue! for one word more Is instant death. Tempt me not with these hands, Which hath the symbols touch'd of blessed peace, To do a horrible act. Pet. I but repeat that which the Sultan hath In public said. Con. Forbear! forbear! I tell thee. [Wrenching his sword, scabbard and all, from his side, and tossing it from him. There! there! Rodrigo: cast it from my reach: Let not a weapon be within my grasp, Or I shall be accursed. [After a violent struggle of passion. I dare speak to him now.âHo! guards without! Ella. Oh, mercy! mercy! Enter Guards. Con. (to guards). Take these two men, Petronius and his friend, And through the city to our outmost post Conduct them safely: there, in perfect liberty, Permit them to depart where'er they list. (To Petronius.) Now, I'm revenged upon thee: get thee hence, And utter not a word.âGo thou, Rodrigo, And with the gentle Ella in thy hand, Conduct them to the palace gate. Hence quickly! Mar. Nay, let Petronius go: I will remain, And with the meanest soldier on your walls Spend my last blood, if a true penitentâ Con. (waving him off impatiently). Well, be it as thou wilt: but hence and leave me! Rod. (to Ella, as he leads her out). Did I not tell thee he was safe, my Ella? [Exeunt all but Constantine, who, after walking up and down for some time in a perturbed manner, starts at the sound of Valeria 's voice without. Con. Ha! here she comes! alas! how shall I now Look on her face, and hear her voice of love! It is distraction! Enter Valeria. Val. My Constantine, art thou so long return'd, And yet to me no kindly summons sent, Long as I've watched for it? What is the matter? Thy brow is dark: these are disturbed looks: What is the matter? Con. Nothing, nothing. I am, thou knowst, with many cares perplex'd. Follow me to thine own apartment; here I cannot speak to thee. Val. (aside, looking eagerly at him as they go out.) What may this be? [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Valeria 's apartment. Enter Constantine, followed by Valeria, who both remain silent for some time, she looking anxiously with wistful expectation. Val. Now we are here, my lord, in the still privacy Of this my inmost bower, but thou art silent. [Pauses, and he is still silent. There is a look of sadness on thy face Of disturb'd wretchedness, that never yet, E'en in thy darkest hours, I've seen thee wear. Why art thou thus? Con. And dost thou ask? I've been, in deep humility, Making a sinner's peace with God and man, And nowâand nowâ [His voice faltering. Val. What would you say, my lord? Con. And now I am with thee. Val. And art thou sad for this? hast thou not still, Loose from all shackles of imposed state, Been with me in thine hours of joy or grief, Like a way-faring man, who sitting down On the green bank, his cumbrous vestment opens To the soft breeze? Con. Yes, my Valeria; I have been with thee As with a true yoked heart, so strong in love, That e'en the thought, which scudded o'er my mind With culprit's speed from shameful consciousness, Was not from thee conceal'd. But now the hour is come, when e'en with thee I must perform a taskâa task of pain. Val. Speak; what meanst thou? Con. All have, e'en in the dearest intercourse Of heart with heart, in some untoward moment Transgressors been, and proved the cause of pain Where most they should have banish'd it: and all, In quitting earthly ties, do anxiously Desire, in the true blessing of forgiveness, To part with those whom they have held most dear. Now dost thou understand me? [Holding out both his hands to her. Val. I do! I do! thou hast my dearest blessing; The dearest thoughts and worship of my heart. But oh! what dost thou say?âpart!âhow, my Constantine! Where dost thou go? thou dost not leave the city? Con. No, love, but on its wall I go ere long,â For in a little hour the day will break Which must its fate decide,âthat part to act, Which, before God and man, in honest pride, I'm call'd on to perform. Val. But from those walls victorious thou'lt return. [Constantine smiles sorrowfully. Nay, but thou shalt return: high heav'n decrees it; Virtue, and every good and blessed thing Have made it sure. E'en in a faith as strong As at this moment I do hold to this, Methinks, upon the chafed and tossing waves Of the wild deep I could thus firmly tread, Nor wet my sandal's thong. [Walking across the stage with firm steps of stately confidence, and then going up to him with an encouraging smile. Be thou assured! I know it shall be so. A mystic sage, Whom I, unknown to thee, have visitedâ Pardon this weakness of thine anxious wifeâ Darting his eye on forms of woven air, Saw thee in combat with a Turkish champion, And saw the crescent fall. Con. And mayst thou not believe, that ere they close Their mortal warfare, many a boastful Turk Beneath these arms shall fall? Val. Ay, but on surer words I rest my faith! For I did bid him onward cast his eye Into time's reach, and say, who of this city, After the course of twelve revolving moons, Should be the sov'reign lord; and he replied, In plain and simple words, thy lord and husband. Con. And named he Constantine? Val. What other name but that of Constantine Could to these appellations be conjoin'd? Thou turnest from me with perturbed looks: Thou shalt not turn away: tell me! O, tell me! What sudden thought is this that troubles thee? [Catching hold of him eagerly as he turns from her. Con. Ask not; Oh, do not ask! 'tis pass'd already As shoots a glaring meteor 'thwart the night, Frightful but hasty. Val. Thou must tell it me. Con. Distract me not. Val. Nay, nay, but thou must tell me. What other name but that of Constantine Could to my lord and husband joined be? Con. (sinking down upon a chair quite overcome, and covering his face with his hands, as he speaks with a quick perturbed voice). Mahomet! Mahomet! [Valeria steps back from him, holding up her hands in amazement; then he, after a pause, looking up to her with a self-upbraiding eye. I have offended in this very hour When my press'd soul sigh'd for that loving peace Which in its earthly close the soul desires. I have offended. Val. Yes, thou hast offended. All the offences thou hast ever done me Are in this fell and cruel stroke comprised; And any other stroke, compared to this. Had fall'n upon me lightly. Con. It was a thought that hasted fast away, And came unbidden. [Going up to her penitently. Val. (turning away in anger). There is no thought doth ever cross the mind, Till some preceding kindred sentiment Hath made a pathway for it. Con. Yes, my Valeria, thou indeed sayst true; But turn not from me angrily. My mind, Ere now, consider'd has the character, The faith, the power of Mahomet.âFrown not.â Valeria, thou art fair.âNay, do not frown! Val. What dost thou say? hast thou until this moment Reserved for me this base degradingâNo: Torn and defaced be every hated form Of outward grace! it is our curse, our shame! [Tearing her hair violently. Con. O be not thus!âforgive a hasty thought! Think how a doating husband is distracted, Who knows too well a lawless victor's power. Val. What is his power? it nought regardeth me. Con. Alas! the frowns of a detesting bride Deter him not! Val. (smiling contemptuously). But will he wed the dead? Con. (starting). What sayst thou? Oh, what meaning is there here! Yes, yes! I know it all! but it is dreadful: It makes the cold chill o'er my limbs to creep: It is not well: it is not holy. No! O no, my noble love, mine honour'd love! Give to thy fallen lord all that the soul To widow'd love may give, but oh, stop there! Heav'n will protect thee in the hour of need; And for the rest, erase it from thy thoughts, Give it no being there. Val. It hath no being there. Heav'n will protect me: And he who thinks me helpless thinks me mean. Con. I think thee all that e'er was tenanted Of noblest worth in loveliest female form: By nature excellent, defective only In this, that fortune has thy virtues link'd To the vex'd spirit of a ruin'd man, Who in his hours of anguish has not prized them As did become their worth. Val. (rushing into his arms). No, thou hast prized them, In thy blind love, far, far beyond their worth. My uncurb'd passions have alas! too oft Vexation added to that burden'd heart I should have cheer'd and lighten'd: on my head Rests all the blame that e'er between us pass'd, And I alone have need to be forgiven. [They weep on one another's necks without speaking, when an alarm bell is heard at a distance, and Constantine breaks suddenly from her. Con. It is the 'larum of my farther watch. Val. I scarcely heard it: art thou sure of it? [A second alarm bell heard nearer. Con. And hark! a nearer tower repeats the sound. The enemy's in motion.âI must arm, And instantly. Val. Then let me be with thee till the last moment! I have a holy relic of great power; It is, I trust, worth all thine arms beside; And from this hand of love thou shalt receive it. Con. (smiling sorrowfully). Thanks, sweet Valeria! from thy hand of love I will with love receive whate'er thou wilt. [A third alarm bell is heard still louder, and enter attendants in haste. Yes, yes, I heard it; go, prepare mine arms. [To attendants, and exeunt. SCENE V. A spacious hall in the palace. Enter Rodrigo, with Ella hanging fondly upon him, and continue their way as if intending to pass through it, when a trumpet sounds without, and they stop short. Rod. It is the sound that summons us to meet: There is no farther grace: therefore, sweet Ella, My pretty Ella, my good loving Ella, My gentle little one, that hangst upon me With such fond hold, in good sooth we must part, Here bid heav'n bless me, and no farther go. Ella. Must it be so? I will bid heaven bless thee, And all good saints watch o'er thy precious life; And they will bless and guard thee in the hour Of fearful death. In this I have true faith; Yet, on the very brink, to hold thee thus Clasp'd in my grasp, and think how soonâAlas! From many points will fly the whizzing balls, And showering darts, and jav'lins sent afar, Aim'd by fell strength; wilt thou escape all this? Rod. Fear not, sweet Ella! whizzing balls there be, That, in midway, are from their course declined By the poor orphan's little lisped prayer; And there be arrows that are turn'd aside, In their swift flight, by the soft sighs of love, Unheard of earthly ears. This is a creed, In the good faith of which poor seamen climb Their rocking masts, in the full roar of battle, And we'll believe it. Ella. It is a blessed one: I would believe it. Rod. Yes, we'll believe it. Whilst our battle roars, Thou'lt think of me in thy lone distant tower, And be to me a gallant armed mate, With prayers and wishes striving powerfully. Give me thy hand: we will not weep and wail: We will part cheerfully.âGod bless thee, Ella! Nay, hang not on me thus. Thou lov'st a brave man: be thou valiant then, As suits a brave man's love. Ella. O no! I've fondly fix'd myself upon thee, Most worthless and unsuited to thy worth. Like a poor weed on some proud turret's brow, I wave, and nod, and kiss the air around thee, But cannot be like thee. Rod. Heav'n bless thee, little flower! I prize thee more Than all the pride of female stateliness. Ella. Dost thou? then I am happy: I am proud: I will not wish me other than I am. Rod. Ah, if we part not instantly, my Ella, I feel in faith, rude as my nature is, I soon shall be like thee!âMy friends approach: Let us not meet their gazeâIt must be soâ Sweet one, farewell!âWilt thou still cling to me? Ella. O no, I go: they shall not see thee weep, Though I do bless thee for it. Rod. (leading her hastily back to the door by which they entered). Well then, brave lass, upon thy lovely head Heaven's favour rest!âNay, do not speak to me. [Preventing her as she is endeavouring to speak. Farewell! farewell! [Exit Ella, and he returns to the front of the stage, where he stands musing sorrowfully; when enters to him Justiniani, and, going up to him, touches his shoulder. What dost thou want? [Turning angrily. Jus. Thou'rt thoughtful. Rod. No, I think as others do With such day's work before them, in good truth, Not passing merrily. Jus. From the high tower I've seen th' approaching foe: It seems a dark and strangely-mixed mass Of life, wide moving in the misty light Of early dawn.âI've fought in many a field, As valiant men and armed warriors fight, But such a strange assemblage of new modes Of mingled war as we this day must face, I never yet encounter'd. Rod. Well, we shall know the scent and flavour of it, When we have tasted it. Jus. We shall be smother'd up with the mean press Of worthless matter, as a noble steed, Beneath the falling rafters of his shed Ignobly perishes. Rod. Fear not, proud soul; we shall have men to fight, And room enough in some nook of the breach To grapple with them too. Jus. Good fortune ever shone on thee, Rodrigo: Thou still hast been a bold careering bark, Outriding ev'ry storm. If thou shouldst e'er Again return to our dear native land, Tell to my countrymen whate'er thou knowst Pertaining to my fate this fateful day: Let me not be forgotten. Rod. I will, my friend: but better fate than thine I look not for, though still I bear myself As one assured of good.âThou'rt dark and gloomyâ Does aught rest on thy mind? Jus. (striding away from him gloomily). No, nothing, nothing! [A trumpet sounds without. Rod. Ay, hark! another of our gallant band Has join'd us with his followers. [Another trumpet sounds. And now another: are they all assembled? Enter Othus, and several of the imperial friends. Othus. On their high wooden turrets, and huge beams Of warlike engines, raised aloft in air, Gleams the first light of this high-fated day; And, wide expanded, through the farther mists Moves the dark Turkish host. Thou'rt a tried soul, Rodrigo, I but new To such tremendous, strange expectancy: Now is the hour when the soul knows itself. [Rising on tiptoe with a conscious smile. Rod. Ay, Othus, thou dost wear the countenance Of a true man: give me thine honest hand. Are all our friends assembled? [Trumpet sounds. Othus. This says they are: and here comes, last of all, Our northern friends. Enter more of the friends. Now we are all assembled. Constantine, He also comes; and sadly by his side, In mournful dignity, moves his high dame, Proudly contending with her woman's heart. Enter Constantine and Valeria, attended. Con. (returning the general salute of the chiefs). Good morrow, noble brothers and brave leaders: Are we all here convened? Othus. Yes, our great chief and brother: of your friends There lacks not one. Con. Then to their love, so help me, Mighty Power, Who holdst within thy grasp the souls of men! Neither shall we be lacking.âNow, Valeria. [Drawing himself up with a proud but tender smile, as if to encourage her to behave nobly. Val. I understand that smile. Here with thy gen'rous friends, whose love to thee Most dearly cell'd within my heart I wear, And unto whom I have desired much, Before we part, these grateful thanks to payâ [Making grateful obeisance to the chiefs. Here to those noble friends, and to God's keeping, I leave thee.âYet, be it permitted meâ For that thy noble head and lib'ral brow Have ever cheer'd me as my star of day, Blessings and blessings let me pour upon them! [Putting her hand upon his head fervently, and kissing his forehead. For that thy gen'rous breast has been the hold Of all my treasured wishes and dear thoughts, This fond embrace. [Embracing him. Yea, and for that thou art My sire, and sov'reign, and most honour'd lord, This humble homage of my heart receive! [Kneeling and kissing his hand. Con. (raising and embracing her with great emotion). No more, my dearest and most noble love! Spare me, O spare me! Heaven be thy protection! Farewell! Val. Farewell! [Valeria is led off by her attendants, whilst Constantine continues looking sadly after her for some time, then turning to his friends, who gather about him, without saying a word, they go all off the stage together in profound silence. ACT V. SCENE I. An open space near the walls of the city, with halfruined houses on each side, and a row of arched pillars thrown across the middle of the stage, as if it were the remains of some ruined public building; through which is seen, in the background, a breach in the walls, and the confused fighting of the besieged, enveloped in clouds of smoke and dust. The noise of artillery, the battering of engines, and the cries of the combatants heard as the curtain draws up, and many people discovered on the front of the stage, running about in great hurry and confusion, and some mounted upon the roofs of the houses overlooking the battle. Voice (calling from the wall). See! see! how, cluster'd on each other's backs, They mount like swarming bees, or locusts link'd In bolt'ring heaps! Pour fire upon their heads! 2d voice. Cast down huge beams upon them! 3d voice. Hurl down the loosen'd fragments of our wall! 4th voice. Ho! more help here! more stones! more beams! more fire! Weapons are useless now. 1st voice. See how that giant Turk, like an arch fiend, Climbs on you living mountain of curved backs! He gains the wall! O hurl him headlong down! He is hurl'd down. [A great shout from the besieged. 2d voice. Send to the emperor or to Rodrigo: They on their diff'rent stations hold it bravely; This is the weakest point. Ho! send for aid! [Exeunt several soldiers from the walls, as if running for succour. The noise of artillery, &amp;c. is heard as before, and afterwards a loud crash as of some building falling. Enter many people in great terror from the walls, running off by the front of the stage different ways, and enter at the same time Constantine and some of his friends, who stop them. Con. Turn, turn! O turn, my friends! another push! Let us still stop the breach, or fall like men. [Enter Justiniani from the walls with a hasty and disordered step, pale and writhing with pain. Merciful heav'n! do mine eyes serve me truly? Justiniani, with pale haggard face, Retiring from his post! Where are you going, chief! [Stopping him sternly. Just. Where nature, urged beyond the pith of nature, Compels me. 'Midst yon streams of liquid fires, And hurling ruins and o'erwhelming mass Of things unknown, unseen, uncalculable, All arms and occupation of a soldier Are lost and turn'd to nought: man's strength is nought: The fangs of hell are in my new-torn flesh: I must on for a space and breathe fresh air. Con. Go to! this moment is the quiv'ring ridge That stands between our success or our ruin:â The sight of thy turn'd back from their screw'd pitch Will turn more hearts than all the pressing foe: Thou must not go. Just. I am a mortal man: The fangs of fiends are in my new-torn flesh: Nature compels me, and I must have succour. [Exit hastily, and writhing with pain. Con. Alas! God pity him! one luckless moment Of weakness and of anguish brings to him A wound that cannot be up-bound. Poor nature! [Enter many fugitives from the walls. Turn, turn! O soldiers! let not this shame be! [To the fugitives. [As he is endeavouring with his friends to rally them and push forward, a terrible shout is heard, and enter a great crowd of fugitives from the walls. What shout was that? Fugitive. The Turks have gained the breach, and through it pour Like an o'erboiling flood. Con. Then is the city lostâthe dark hour comeâ And as an emperor my task is closed. God's will be done! [Throwing away the imperial purple. Now is there left for me these sinew'd arms, And this good sword, the wherewithal to earn A noble soldier's death. Come on with me who will, and share the fate Of a brave comrade. A fugitive (joined by several others). Yes, we'll share thy fate, Comrade or sov'reign, noble Constantine! We will die by thy side. [Exit Constantine, followed by his friends and several of the fugitives, and passing through the pillars to the background, rushes amidst the confusion of the fight. A terrible noise of arms, &amp;c. and presently one of the pillars in the middle of the stage falling down, a wider view of the battle is opened, and the Turks are seen rushing through the breach, and bearing every thing before them. Re-enter Constantine wounded, but still fighting bravely, though oppressed with numbers, and falls down near the front of the stage, the enemy passing on and leaving him. Con. Am I then left? Oh, is there ne'er a Christian soldier near me That will cut off my head? Ho! thou Turk there! [To a Turk who is going to pass him. Turk. Art thou not dead? Con. No, one half of me, Turk, is living still, [Raising himself half up from the ground. And still a match for thee. Turk. Ha! sayst thou so? we'll put it to the proof. Yet thou'rt a brave man, though thou art a Greek, I would far rather let thee die in peace. Con. No, no! have at thee! [Pushing at the Turk with his sword, who, turning against him as he is half raised from the ground, thrusts him through the body. I thank thee, friendly foeman, this will do: Thou hast done me good service. Turk. And thou art welcome to it. Fare thee well! A good death to thee! for thou art no Greek. [Exit. Con. Ay, this will do: this hath the true stern gripe Of potent speedy death. My task is closed. I now put off these weeds of flesh and blood, And, thanks be unto Him who clothed me in them! Untarnish'd with disgrace. What cometh after Full surely cometh well. 'Tis a dark pass.â [Catching at a dropped garment that has been left by some of the fugitives on the ground near him. Here is a ready shround to wrap my head: This death deals shrewdly with me. [Covers his face and dies, after a considerable struggle. Enter Rodrigo, Othus, and Marthon, with two or three of their followers, fighting bravely with a party of Turks, whom they beat off the stage. Othus. Now for a space those ruffians stand aloof: This is a pause that calls upon the mind: What shall we do? Rod. How do men act, when they together stand, On the last perch of the swift-sinking wreck? Do they not bravely give their parting cheer, And make their last voice loud and boldly sound Amidst the hollow roarings of the storm? E'en so will we: we'll bear our manhood up To the last push. Othus. Thou speakest well, brave seaman: thou dost speak What the heart owns: we will do even so. But oh, that our brave leader now were near us, Living or dead! Doth no one know his fate? I thought by him to have died. 1st fol. What corpse is this so cover'd? on its sandal It wears th' imperial bird in fretted gold. Othus. Then it is he! [Tearing off the covering eagerly from the head of Constantine. O thou brave heart! thou hast gone to thy rest With honour. Heav'n be praised that thou hast! Here round thee our last gathering point shall be: Here will we fight, nor shall thy honour'd body Suffer, whilst one of us has strength to fight, The slightest insult. Rod. Ay, they shall hack us into raven's meat, Ere on his gallant corpse there be impress'd One touch of impious hands! [A loud noise of shrieking and terror heard without. Othus. Hear the wild cries of terror and despair, Mix'd with the din of carnage! Now those cowards, Who let this brave man all unaided perish, Are suff'ring that which, in his fellest pinch, The valiant never suffers. But see, the enemy again returns With doubled fury! Rod. Come they? then we are ready for them. Yonder Stands a small walled dome, within whose portal We for a time may face ten thousand foes: There will we take our stand, and there will we Do our last deeds of men. Come on, brave mates! Take up our honour'd treasure; and, so burden'd, He that doth grapple with us had as lief Pull from the lion's hug his bosom'd whelp. [The followers take up the body, and Othus and Rodrigo retire, defending it bravely from a party of Turks, who enter and fall upon them as they are bearing it off. SCENE II. An apartment in one of the towers of the palace. Enter Valeria in great alarm, followed by Lucia and attendants. Val. Louder and louder still the dreadful sound Of battle swells. Is it not nearer us? This lofty tower the widest view commands; Open that lattice quickly. [Pointing to a window which Lucia opens, and then, rushing on eagerly to look, shrinks back again. I pray thee look thyself, mine eyes are dark, And I see nothing. Oh, what seest thou? Tell me, whate'er it be. Lucia (looking out). Nothing but clouds of smoke and eddying dust: A dun and grumly darkness spreads o'er all, From which arise those horrid sounds, but nought Distinctive of the sight can I discern. Val. (after pacing backward and forward with an unequal, restless, agitated step). Oh, will this state of tossing agony No termination have! Send out, I pray thee, Another messenger. Lucia. Indeed I have in little space of time Sent many forth, but none return again. Val. In little space! Oh it hath been a term Of horrible length! such as rack'd fiends do reckon Upon their tossing beds of surgy flames, Told by the lashes of each burning tide That o'er them breaks. Hark! the quick step of one With tidings fraught! Dost thou not hear it? Lucia. No; I hear it not. Val. Still is it the false coinage of my fears? Ah! hearing, sight, and every sense is now False and deceitful grown. I'll sit me down, And think no more, but let the black hour pass In still and fixed stupor o'er my head. [Sits down upon a low seat, and supports her bended head upon both her hands. Lucia (listening). Now I do hear the sound of real feet In haste approaching. Val. (starting up). Some one brings us tidings. What may they be? Quick steps should bring us good. Enter Messenger. Say all thou hast to say, and say it quickly. If it be good, hold up thy blessed hand, And I will bless the token. No, thou dost not! 'Tis evil then. How is it with my lord? What dangers still encompass him? Mes. No dangers. Val. And dost thou say so with that terrible look? Is he alive? Have all deserted him? Mes. No, round his body still some brave men fight, And will not quit him till they be as he is. [Valeria, uttering a loud shriek, falls back into the arms of her attendants, and is carried off, followed by Lucia and the messenger. SCENE III. A hall in the palace. Enter a crowd of frightened women, and seem hurrying on to some place of greater security. 1st woman (stopping). No, we are wrong; we'll to the eastern tower, That is the most retired; that last of all Will tempt their search. 2d woman. In the deep vaulted caverns of the palace, Might we not for a while conceal'd remain, Till heav'n shall send us means? Omnes. Ay, thou art right; that is the best of all: We'll to the vaults. [As they are all turning and hurrying back again, enter a domestic officer of the palace, and stops them. Offi. Where do ye run with such wild looks of fear? Think ye the Turks are passing through the city, Like the short visit of a summer's storm, That you in holes and rocks may safely hide Until it be o'erblown? 1st woman. Oh, no! we know that they are come for ever! Yet for a little while we fain would save us From fearful things. Offi. I come to tell you that by Mah'met's orders The cruel Turks have stopp'd their bloody work, And peace again is in our walls. 1st woman. Sayst thou? And art thou sure of this? and hast thou seen it? Offi. Yes, I have seen it. Like a sudden gleam Of fierce returning light at the storm's close, Glancing on horrid sights of waste and sorrow, Came the swift word of peace, and to the eye Gave consciousness of that which the wild uproar And dire confusion of the carnage hid. 1st woman. Alas! be there such sights within our walls? Offi. Yes, maid, such sights of blood! such sights of nature! In expectation of their horrid fate, Widows, and childless parents, and lorn dames, Sat by their unwept dead with fixed gaze, In horrible stillness. But when the voice of grace was heard aloud, So strongly stirr'd within their roused souls The love of life, that, even amidst those horrors, A joy was seenâjoy hateful and unlovely. I saw an aged man rise from a heap Of grizly dead, whereon, new murder'd, lay His sons and grandsons, yea, the very babe Whose cradle he had rock'd with palsied hands, And shake his grey locks at the sound of life With animation wild and horrible. I saw a mother with her murder'd infant Still in her arms fast lock'd, spring from the groundâ No, no! I saw it not! I saw it not! It was a hideous fancy of my mind: I have not seen it. But I forget my chiefest errand here. 1st woman. And what is that! Offi. It is to bid you tell your royal mistress, It may, perhaps, somewhat assuage her grief, That Othus and Rodrigo, with some followers, The last remains of the imperial band, Fighting, in all the strength of desperation, Around the body of their fallen chief, Have moved to gen'rous thoughts the Sultan's breast; Who has their valour honour'd with full leave, In blessed ground, with military pomp, Becoming his high state and valiant worth, To lay his dear remains. This with their lives On honourable terms he freely grants. 1st woman. And do those brave men live? Offi. They do; but Othus soon I fear will be With him he mourns.âDelay no more, I pray: Inform the empress speedily of this. 1st woman. Alas! she is not in a state to hear it: The phrenzy of her grief repels all comfort.â But softly!âhush!âmethinks I hear her voice. She's coming hither in the restless wand'rings Of her untamed mind.âStand we aside, And speak not to her yet. Enter Valeria with her hair dishevelled, and in all the wild disorder of violent sorrow, followed by Ella and Lucia, who seem endeavouring to soothe her. Val. Forbear all words, and follow me no more. I now am free to wander where I list; To howl i' the desert with the midnight winds, And fearless be amidst all fearful things. The storm has been with me, and I am left Torn and uprooted, and laid in the dust With those whom after-blasts rend not again. I am in the dark gulf where no light is. I am on the deep bed of sunken floods, Whose swoln and welt'ring billows rise no more To bear the tossed wreck back to the strand. Lucia. Oh, say not so! heav'n doth in its good time Send consolation to the sharpest woe. It still in kindness sends to the tried soul Its keenest suff'rings. So say holy men; And therein good men trust. Val. I hear, I hear thee! in mine ear thy voice Sounds like the feeble night-fly's humming noise, To him, who in the warfare of vex'd sleep, Strives with the phantoms of his inward world. Yes, there is comfort when the sun is dark, And time hath run his course, and the still'd sleepers Lift up their heads at the tremendous crash Of breaking worlds.âI know all this.âBut here, Upon this living earth, what is there found? It is a place of groans and hopeless woe. Let me then tear my hair and wring my hands, And raise my voice of anguish and despair, This is my portion now, all else is gone. Lucia. Nay, think not virtuous innocence forsaken: Put in high heav'n thy trust, it will sustain thee. Val. Ah! I did think when virtue bravely stood, Fronting its valiant breast to the fierce onset Of worthless power, that it full surely stood: That ev'ry spiritual and righteous power Was on its side: and in this faith, ofttimes, Methought I could into the furnace mouth Have thrust my hand, and grasp'd the molten flames. Yet on his head it fell: that noble head, Upon whose manly gracefulness was fix'd The gaze of ev'ry eye. Oh! on his lib'ral front there beam'd a look, Unto the which all good and gen'rous hearts Answer return'd.âIt was a gentle head, Bending in pleasant kindliness to all; So that the timid, who approach'd him trembling, With cheer'd and vaunting steps retired again. It was a crowned head, yet was it left Exposed and fenceless in the hour of danger: What should have been his safety was his bane. Away, poor mock'ry of a wretched state! [Tearing the regal ornaments from her neck, and scattering them about. Be ye strew'd to the winds! But for this let We had been blest; for he as truly loved, In simplest tenderness. as the poor hind, Who takes his humble house-mate by the hand, And says, âthis is my all.ââOff, cursed band! Which round our happiness hath been entwined Like to a straggling cord: upon the earth Be thou defaced and trampled! [Tearing the tiara from her head and stamping upon it, then pacing up and down distractedly. Lucia. Alas! my royal mistress, be entreated! This furious grief will but enhance its pain: Oh, bear yourself as more becomes your state! Val. Yes, I will bear me as becomes my state. I am a thing of wretchedness and ruin. That upon which my pride and being grew Lies in the dust, and be the dust my bed. [Throwing herself upon the ground, and pushing away Lucia and her other attendants, who endeavour to raise her up again. Forbear! forbear! and let me on the ground Spread out my wretched hands! It pleases me To think that in its bosom is a restâ Yea, there lie they unheeded and forgotten, To whom all tongues give praise, all hearts give blessing. Oh, ev'ry heart did bless him though he fell, And ne'er a saving hand was foundâOh! oh! [Bursting into an agony of grief, and laying her head upon the ground, covered with both her hands. Ella (to Lucia and attendants). Do not surround her thus! I'll sit and watch her. I will not speak, but sit and weep by her; And she shall feel, e'en through her heavy woe, That sympathy and kindness are beside her. Val. (raising her head). There spoke a gentle voice: is Ella near me? Ella. Yes, I am near, and shall be ever near you. Val. Wilt thou? I do believe, sweet maid, thou wilt. Lay thy soft hand on mine.âYes, it feels kindly. Had he, thy valiant love, been near his lordâ Ay, they did love each other with that love Which brave men knowâOh, ev'ry noble stranger, In admiration of his noble worth, Did call him lord; whilst they, his native subjects, They who had seen him grow within their walls,â Alas! where lightly tripp'd his infant steps; Where in gay sports his stripling's strength was tried; Where tower'd in graceful pride his manly bloom; Even there a lifeless, ghastly form he lies. Enter another domestic officer, and, seeing Valeria on the gr ound, steps back. Lucia (to the officer). What wouldst thou here? Offi. I must, perforce, speak my unwelcome tidings. The Sultan is already in the palace, And follows hard my steps with a fix'd purpose To see the empress. Val. (raising herself half from the ground). What fearful words are these? in my soul's anguish Comes this so quickly on me? Be it so! I cleave to th' earth! what have I now to do? I am a stilled thing, abased and crush'd; What boots it now who gazes on my woe? Enter Mahomet with Osmir and his train. Mah. (to Osmir, after looking at Valeria steadfastly). She stirs not, Osmir, e'en at my approach, She sits upon the ground, unmoved and still. Thou sorrow-clouded beauty, not less lovely [Going up to her. For this thy mournful state!âShe heeds me not. Empress and sov'reign dame, unto those titles Which thou shalt ever wear, vouchsafe regard. (To Osmir.) Still she regards me not. (After a pause.) Widow of Constantineâ Val. (rousing herself quickly). Ay, now thou callest on me by a name Which I do hear. There is strength in the sound To do all possible things! [Rising quickly from the ground, and accosting Mahomet with an air of high assumed state. What wouldst thou say to her who proudly wears That honour'd title? Mah. Widow of Constantine; I come not here In the stern spirit of a conqu'ror. The slaughter of your people, by my order, Is stopp'd; and to your bravely fallen lord I have decreed such fun'ral obsequies As suit a valiant warrior and a king. Othus, and brave Rodrigo, and those men Who to the last their master's corpse defended, I have with honour graced.âLacks there aught still That, from the dark cloud which so deeply shades That awful beauty, one approving ray Might softly draw? Speak, and it shall be done. Val. Ask aught from thee! Mah. Yes, whatsoe'er thou wilt: For now too well I feel I have no power That can oppose thy will. Val. I give you thanks: I have a thing to ask. Mah. Name it, and it is granted. Val. A place in the quiet tomb with my fall'n lord, Therein to rest my head. This is my boon. Mah. Well, and it shall be granted, fair Valeria, When that fair form is fitted for such rest. But whilstâ [Approaching her with an air of free admiration. Val. (putting him at a distance haughtily). No more:âI do not ask it sooner. Yet that it be a sealed deed between us, Permit me here to put into your hands A mark'd memorial. Some few paces off It is deposited; I will return And give it to you instantly. [Exit, attended by Lucia, Ella, &amp;c. Mah. (to Osmir, looking after her as she goes out). See, with what awful loveliness she moves! Did all our bower'd prisons e'er contain Aught like to that? Osmir. It does indeed a wondrous mixture seem Of woman's loveliness with manly state; And yet, methinks, I feel as though it were Strange, and perplexing, and unsuitable. 'Tis not in nature. Mah. Thinkst thou so, good vizir? Thou'rt right, belike, but it is wondrous graceful. [A loud shriek of women heard without. What shrieks are these? Run thou and learn the cause. [Osmir going, is prevented by Valeria, who re-enters with her robe wrapped across her breast, and supported by Lucia, and Ella, and her other attendants, who seem in great affliction round her. Val. (speaking as she enters). Mourn not; the thing is past that was to be. Conduct me to the Sultan: I have still Strength to fulfil my task. Mah. Great Prophet! what is this? (To Valeria.) What hast thou done? Val. Brought thee the mark'd memorial of my right. [Showing a dagger. And that I now am fitted for that rest, The honour'd rest which you have granted me, Being the fix'd condition of your promise, Here is the witness. [Opening her robe, and showing the wound in her breast. Mah. O sad and cruel sight! Is there no aid? O live, thou wondrous creature, and be aught Thy soul desires to be! Val. (after sinking back into a seat, supported by her attendants). I now am what my soul desires to be, And what one happy moment of strength wound Beyond the pitch of shrinking nature makes me; Widow of Constantine, without reproach, And worthy to partake the honour'd rest Of the brave lord whose living love I shared, As shares the noble wife a brave man's love. Mah. Prophet of God, be there such ties as these! Enter Rodrigo, and Othus wounded and supporting himself feebly upon his sheathed sword. Val. And here come, in good time, my living friends: I shall once more those gen'rous men behold, The sad remains of those who loved their lord. [Holding out a hand to each of them. You know, brave brothers, how it is with me; For such you were to him, and such to me My heart now truly owns you. Othus. Yes, we have heard: they told us as we enter'd. Most noble woman, worthy of thy lord! [Endeavouring feebly to kneel and kiss her hand, whilst Rodrigo does so on the other side of her. Val. This day's rough tempest's o'er, my good Rodrigo, And thou still liv'st to strive in other storms: Heaven's high blessing and my dying thanks Rest on thy gen'rous worth!âI would say more, But now I feel I may not. Where art thou, Ella? [Putting Ella 's hand in his. Here do I return The trust thou gavest me; and if the Sultan Will yet to me one last request vouchsafe, He will confirm this gift. Mah. It is confirm'd. Val. I thank you, gracious victor. Heaven bless you both! [To Ella and Rodrigo, who both kneel and kiss her hands. Othus, the dead go to their silent rest, [To Othus, looking fixedly at him. And are no more remember'd: but thy lordâ He whom thou lovedstâhe whom all hearts lovedâ He who so noble and so gentle wasâ Well skill'd art thou to paint the deeds of menâ Thou wilt not suffer him to be forgotten? What means that woeful motion of thy head? Mine eyes wax dim, or do I truly see thee? Thy visage has a strange and ghastly look: How is it with thee? Othus. As one who standeth at the city's gate, Through which his earlier friends have pass'd, and waits Impatiently, girt in his traveller's robe, To hear the welcome creaking of its bars. Val. Ah! art thou wounded then? Alas! alas! Art thou too of our company? sad trav'llers Unto a world unknown! Othus. Nay, say not sad, though to a world unknown. The foster'd nursling, at th' appointed season, Who leaves his narrow crib and cottage-home For the fair mansion of his lordly sire, Goes to a world unknown. Val. Ay, thou wouldst cheer me, and I will be cheer'd. There reigns above who casts His dark shade o'er us, Mantling us on our way to glorious light. I have offended, and I should be fearful, But there is sent in mercy to my heart, For which I humbly giveâO no, I may not! Death is upon me now.âElla and Lucia: Stand closer to me: let me firmly grasp Something that I have loved! [Catching hold of them with a convulsive grasp. It will soon cease: Farewell unto you all! [Dies. [A solemn pause, all standing round and gazing upon the body. Othus. And this is the last form that we do wear, Unto the sad and solemn gaze of those Who have beheld us in our days of joy. Honour and deepest rev'rence be to thee, Thou honour'd dead! [Bowing respectfully to the body. Mah. Great God of heav'n! was this a woman's spirit That took its flight? Rod. Let ev'ry proudest worship be upon her, For she is number'd with the gallant dead! Not in the trophied field, nor sculptured dome; No, nor beneath the dark and billowy deep Lies one, o'er whom the valiant living would With truer zeal their lofty banners wave, Or bid the deep-mouth'd cannon nobly tell How brave men mourn the brave. How is it, Othus? something in thine eye Of joyous sadness looks upon me wistfully. [To Othus, who takes him tenderly by the hand. Othus. Dost thou not guess?âBut I would speak to thee Of a brave soldier, who, in one short moment Of nature's weakness, has a wound received That will unto his life as fatal prove As fellest foeman's thrust: who in his rest Will not be mourn'd as brave men mourn the brave. Justiniani in his cave of shameâ Rod. And therein let him perish! He hath disgraced a soldier's honest fame: He hath disgraced the country of his birth: He hathâIt makes me stamp upon the ground To think that one, who grasp'd with brother's hand The noble Constantine, should basely turn. Name not his cursed name! Othus. Art thou so stern? In a lone cave he groans, On the damp earth, in deepest agony Of the soul's shrewdest sufferings. I have By an old soldier been advised of this, And I would go to him, but that I feel I needs must go where a more powerful call Doth summon me. Rod. (softened). Ah! must thou then so soon, my gen'rous Othus! Must thou so soon? Well, ask whate'er thou wilt: I give my chafed passion to the winds. Ah! goest thou? Do I the last remain Of those who loved the noble Constantine? The last of a brave band? Alas! alas! [Embracing Othus tenderly. Osmir (to Mahomet, who strides up and down in gloomy agitation). Most mighty Mahomet, what thus disturbs you? May not your slave in humble zeal be told? Mah. Away! away! thy humble zeal I know; Yea, and the humble zeal of such as thou art. The willing service of a brave man's heart, That precious pearl, upon the earth exists, But I have found it not. [Turning to Othus and Rodrigo. Ye valiant men who have so served your prince, There still is in the world a mighty monarch, Who, if he might retain you near his throne, Shall he say near his heart, in such dear zeal? Would think his greatness honour'd. Othus. Great Sultan, thou hast conquer'd with such arms As power has given to thee, th' imperial city Of royal Constantine; but other arms, That might the friends of Constantine subdue, Heav'n has denied thee. Rod. No, mighty prince; they who have served for love Cannot like flying pennons be transferr'd From bark to bark. Mah. (impatiently). I understand you well, and you are free. My arms, such as they are, of heav'n are bless'd; That is enough. Othus. That were indeed enough; but heaven ofttimes Success bestows where blessing is denied. A secret spirit whispers to my heart, That in these walls your weaken'd wretched race, Slaves of their slaves, in gloomy prison'd pomp, Shall shed each other's blood, and make these towers A place of groans and anguish, not of bliss: And think not when the good and valiant perish By worldly power o'erwhelm'd, that heav'n's high favour Shines not on them.âOh, no! then shines it most. For then in them it shows th' approving world The worth of its best work. And from their fate a glorious lesson springs; A lesson of such high ennobling power; Connecting us with such exalted things As all do feel, but none with such true force, Such joy, such triumph, as a dying man. [Falling back into the arms of Rodrigo. THE FAMILY LEGEND: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA TO WALTER SCOTT, ESQ., WHOSE FRIENDLY ZEAL ENCOURAGED ME TO OFFER IT TO THE NOTICE OF MY INDULGENT COUNTRYMEN. I INSCRIBE THIS PLAY. MEN Maclean, chief of the clan of that name. Earl of Argyll. John of Lorne, son to Argyll. Sir Hubert de Grey, friend to Lorne. Benlora, the kinsmen and chief vassals of Maclean. Lochtarish, the kinsmen and chief vassals of Maclean. Glenfadden, the kinsmen and chief vassals of Maclean. Morton. Dugald. Piper, fishermen, vassals, &amp;c.WOMEN Helen, daughter of Argyll, and wife of Maclean. Rosa. Fisherman's wife. Scene in the Island of Mull, and the opposite coast, &amp;c., and afterwards in Argyll 's castle. ACT I. SCENE I. Before the gate of Maclean's castle, in the Isle of Mull: several Highlanders discovered crossing the stage, carrying loads of fuel; whilst Benlora is seen on one side, in the background, pacing to and fro, and frequently stopping and muttering to himself. 1st high. This heavy load, I hope, will be the last: My back is almost broken. 2d high. Sure am I, Were all the beeves in Mull slain for the feast, Fuel enough already has been stow'd To roast them all: and must we still with burdens Our weary shoulders gall? Enter Morton. Mor. Ye lazy lubbards! Grumble ye thus?âYe would prefer, I trow, To sun your easy sides, like household curs, Each on his dung-hill stretch'd, in drowsy sloth. Fy on't! to grumble on a day like this, When to the clan a rousing feast is giv'n, In honour of an heir born to the chiefâ A brave Maclean, still to maintain the honours Of this your ancient race! 1st high. A brave Maclean indeed!âvile mongrel hound! Come from the south, where all strange mixtures be Of base and feeble! sprung of varlet's blood! What is our race to thee? 2d high. (to Morton). Thou'lt chew, I doubt not, Thy morsel in the hall with right good relish, Whether Maclean or Campbell be our lord. Morton. Ungracious surly lubbards! in, I say, And bring your burdens quicker. And, besides, Where are the heath and hare-bells, from the glen, To deck my lady's chamber? 2d high. To deck my lady's chamber! Morton. Heartless hounds! Is she not kind and gentle? spares she aught Her gen'rous stores afford, when you or yours Are sick, or lack relief? Hoards she in chests, When shipwreck'd strangers shiver on our coast, Or robe or costly mantle?âAll comes forth! And when the piercing shriek of drowning mariners Breaks through the night, up-starting from her couch, To snatch, with eager haste, the flaming torch, And from the tower give notice of relief, Who comes so swiftly as her noble self? And yet ye grumble. 1st high. Ay, we needs must own, That, were she not a Campbell, fit she were To be a queen, or e'en the thing she isâ Our very chieftain's dame. But, in these towers, The daughter of Argyll to be our lady! Morton. Out! mountain savages! is this your spite? Go to! 2d high. Speakst thou to us? thou Lowland loon! Thou wand'ring pedlar's son, or base mechanic! Com'st thou to lord it here o'er brave Macleans? We'll carry loads at leisure, or forbear, As suits our fancy best, nor wait thy bidding. [Exeunt highlanders grumbling, and followed by Morton. [Manet Benlora, who now comes forward, and after remaining some time on the front of the stage, wrapt in thought, not observing Lochtarish, who enters behind him. Heigh ho! heigh ho, the day! Loch. How so? What makes Benlora sigh so deeply? Ben. (turning round). And does Lochtarish ask? Full well thou knowst, The battles of our clan I've boldly fought, And well maintain'd its honour. Loch. Yes, we know it. Ben. Who dared, unpunish'd, a Maclean to injure? Yea; he who dared but with a scornful lip Our name insult, I thought it feeble vengeance If steed or beast within his walls were left, Or of his holds one tower unruin'd stood. Loch. Ay; who dared then to brave us? Ben. Thus dealt Benlora e'en with common foes; But in the warfare of our deadly feud, When rang the earth beneath our bloody strife, And brave Macleans brave Campbells boldly fronted, (Fiends as they are, I still must call them brave,) What sword more deeply drank the hated blood Than this which now I graspâbut idly grasp! Loch. There's ne'er a man of us that knows it not, That swears not by thy valour. Ben. Until that fatal day, by ambush ta'en, And in a dungeon kept, where, two long years, Nor light of day, nor human voice e'er cheer'd My loneliness, when did I ever yield, To e'en the bravest of that hateful name, One step of ground upon the embattled fieldâ One step of honour in the banner'd hall? Loch. Indeed thou hast our noble champion been; Deserving well the trust our chief deceased, This chieftain's father, did to thee consign. But when thou wast a captive, none to head us, But he, our youthful lord, yet green in arms, We fought not like Macleans; or else our foe, By fiends assisted, fought with fiend-like power, Farâfar beyond the Campbells' wonted pitch. E'en so it did befal:âwe lost the day:â That fatal day!âThen came this shameful peace. Ben. Ay, and this wedding; when, in form of honour Conferr'd upon us, Helen of Argyll Our sov'reign dame was made,âa bosom worm, Nursed in that viper's nest, to infuse its venom Through all our after race. This is my welcome! From dungeons freed, to find my once-loved home With such vile change disgraced; to me more hateful Than thraldom's murkiest den. But to be loosen'd From captive's chains to find my hands thus bound! Loch. It is, indeed, a vile and irksome peace. Ben. Peace, say they! who will bonds of friendship sign Between the teeming ocean's finny broods, And say, âSport these upon the hither waves, And leave to those that farther billowy reach?â A Campbell here to queen it o'er our heads, The potent dame o'er quell'd and beaten men, Rousing or soothing us, as proud Argyll Shall send her secret counsel!âhold, my heart! This, base degen'rate men!âthis, call ye peace? Forgive my weakness: with dry eyes I laid My mother in her grave, but now my cheeks Are, like a child's, with scalding drops disgraced. Loch. What I shall look upon, ere in the dust My weary head be laid to rest, heav'n knows, Since I have lived to see Benlora weep. Ben. One thing, at least, thou ne'er shalt live to seeâ Benlora crouching, where he has commanded. Go ye, who will, and crowd the chieftain's hall, And deal the feast, and nod your grizzled heads To martial pibrochs, play'd, in better days, To those who conquer'd, not who woo'd their foes; My soul abhors it. On the sea-beaten rock, Remov'd from ev'ry form and sound of man; In proud communion with the fitful winds Which speak, with many tongues, the fancied words Of those who long in silent dust have slept; While eagles scream, and sullen surges roarâ The boding sounds of ill;âI'll hold my feast,â My moody revelry. Loch. Nay, why so fierce? Thinkst thou we are a tame and mongrel pack? Dogs of true breed we are, though for a time Our master-hound forsakes us. Rouse him forth The noble chace to lead: his deep-toned yell Full well we know; and for the opening sport Pant keenly. Ben. Ha! is there amongst you still Spirit enough for this? Loch. Yes, when good opportunity shall favour. Of this, my friend, I'll speak to thee more fully When time shall better serve. Maclean, thou knowst, Is of a soft, unsteady, yielding nature; And this, too well, the crafty Campbell knew, When to our isle he sent this wily witch To mould, and govern, and besot his wits, As suits his crafty ends. I know the youth: This dame or we must hold his will in thraldom: Which of the two,âBut softly: steps approach. Of this again. Ben. As early as thou wilt. Loch. Then be it so: some staunch determined spirits This night in Irka's rocky cavern meet; There must thou join us. Wear thou here the while A brow less cloudy, suited to the times. Enter Glenfadden. See, here comes one who wears a merry face; Yet, ne'ertheless, a clan's-man staunch he is, Who hates a Campbell, worse than Ilcom's monks The horned fiend. Ben. Ha! does he so? [Turning graciously to Glenfadden. Glenfadden! How goes it with thee?âJoyous days are theseâ These days of peace. Glen. These days of foul disgrace! Com'st thou to cheer the piper in our hall, And goblets quaff to the young chieftain's health, From proud Argyll descended? Ben. (smiling grimly). Yes, Glenfadden, If ye will have it so; not else. Glen. Thy handâ Thy noble hand!âthou art Benlora still. [Shaking Benlora warmly by the hand, and then turning to Lochtarish. Know ye that banish'd Allen is return'dâ Allen of Dura? Loch. No; I knew it not. But in good time he comes. A daring knave! He will be useful. [After considering. Of Maclean we'll crave His banishment to cancel; marking well How he receives it. This will serve to show The present bent and bearing of his mind. [After considering again. Were it not also well, that to our council He were invited, at a later hour, When of our purpose we shall be assured? Glen. Methinks it were. Loch. In, then; now is our time. Ben. I'll follow thee when I awhile have paced Yon lonely path, and thought upon thy counsel. [Exeunt Lochtarish and Glenfadden into the castle, and Benlora by the opposite side. SCENE II. An apartment in the castle. Enter Morton and Rosa, speaking as they enter. Rosa. Speak with my lady privately? Mor. Ay, please you: Something I have to say, regards her nearly. And though I doubt not, madam, your attachmentâ Rosa. Good Morton, no apology: thy caution Is prudent; trust me not till thou hast proved me. But oh! watch o'er thy lady with an eye Of keen and guarded zeal! she is surroundedâ [Looking round the room. Does no one hear us?âO those baleful looks That, from beneath dark surly brows, by stealth, Are darted on her by those stern Macleans! Ay; and the gestures of those fearful men, As on the shore in savage groups they meet, Sending their loosen'd tartans to the wind, And tossing high their brawny arms where oft In vehement discourse, I have, of late, At distance mark'd them. Yes; thou shakest thy head: Thou hast observed them too. Mor. I have observed them oft. That calm Lochtarish, Calm as he is, the growing rancour fosters: For, fail the offspring of their chief, his sons Next in succession are. He hath his ends, For which he stirs their ancient hatred up; And all too well his dev'lish pains succeed. Rosa. Too well indeed! The very bed-rid crones To whom my lady sends, with kindly care, Her cheering cordials,âcouldst thou have believed it? Do mutter spells to fence from things unholy, And grumble, in a hollow smother'd voice, The name of Campbell, as unwillingly They stretch their wither'd hands to take her bounty. The wizards are in pay to rouse their fears With dismal tales of future ills foreseen, From Campbell and Maclean together join'd, In hateful union.âE'en the very children, Sporting the heath among, when they discover A loathsome toad or adder on their path, Crush it with stones, and, grinding wickedly Their teeth, in puny spite, call it a Campbell. Benlora, too, that savage gloomy manâ Morton. Ay, evil is the day that brings him back, Unjustly by a Campbell hath he been, The peaceful treaty of the clans unheeded, In thraldom kept; from which but now escaped, He like a furious tiger is enchafed, And thinks Argyll was privy to the wrong His vassal put upon him. Well I know His bloody vengeful nature: and Maclean, Weak and unsteady, moved by ev'ry counsel, Brave in the field, but still in purpose timid, Ofttimes the instrument in wicked hands Of wrongs he would abhor,âalas, I fear, Will ill defend the lovely spouse he swore To love and cherish. Rosa. Heavy steps approach: Hush! see who comes upon us!âsly Lochtarish, And his dark colleagues.âWherefore come they hither? [Morton retires to the bottom of the stage, and enter Lochtarish, Benlora, and Glenfadden. Loch. We thought, fair maid, to find the chieftain here. Rosa. He is in these apartments. Loch. Would it greatly Annoy your gentleness to tell his honour, We wait to speak with him upon affairs Of much concernment? Rosa. My service is not wanted; to your wish, See, there he comes unwarn'd, and with him too His noble lady. [Retiring to the bottom of the stage. Loch. Ha! there they come! see how he hangs upon her With boyish fondness! Glen. Ah, the goodly creature! How fair she is! how winning!âSee that form; Those limbs beneath their foldy vestments moving, As though in mountain clouds they robed were, And music of the air their motion measured. Loch. Ay, shrewd and crafty earl! 'tis not for nought Thou hither sent'st this jewel of thy race. A host of Campbells, each a chosen man, Could not enthral us, as, too soon I fear, This single Campbell will. Shrewd crafty foe! Ben. Hell lend me aid, if heaven deny its grace, But I will thwart him, crafty though he be! Loch. But now for your petition: see we now How he receives your suit. Enter Maclean and Helen. Ben. (eyeing her attentively as she enters). A potent foe it is: ay, by my faith, A fair and goodly creature! Mac. Again, good morrow to you, gallant kinsmen: Come ye to say I can with any favour The right good liking prove, and high regard I bear to you, who are my chiefest strength,â The pillars of my clan? Ben. Yes, we are come, Maclean, a boon to beg. Loch. A boon that, granted, will yourself enrich. Mac. Myself enrich? Loch. Yes; thereby wilt thou be One gallant man the richer. Hear us out. Allen of Dura, from his banishmentâ Mac. False reiver! name him not.âIs he return'd? Dares he again set foot upon this isle? Ben. Yes, chief; upon this isle set foot he hath: And on nor isle nor mainland doth there step A braver man than he.âLady, forgive me: The boldest Campbell never saw his back. Hel. Nay, good Benlora, ask not my forgiveness: I love to hear thee praise, with honest warmth, The valiant of thy name, which now is mine. Ben. (aside). Ha! good Benlora!âthis is queenly pride. (Aloud.) Madam, you honour us. Helen. If so, small thanks be to my courtesy, Sharing myself with pride the honest fame Of every brave Maclean.âI'll henceforth keep A proud account of all my gallant friends: And every valiant Campbell therein noted, On the opposing leaf, in letters fair, Shall with a brave Maclean be proudly match'd. [Benlora and Glenfadden bow in silence. Loch. Madam, our grateful duty waits upon you. (Aside to Benlora.) What thinkst thou of her, friend? Ben. (aside to Lochtarish). What think I of her? Incomparable hypocrite! Loch. (aloud). But to our suit: for words of courtesy It must not be forgotten.âChief, vouchsafe: Benlora here, who from his loathly prison, Which for your sake two years he hath endured, Begs earnestly this grace for him we mention'd, Allen of Dura. [Aside to Benlora. Kneel, man; be more pressing. Ben. (aside to Lochtarish). Nay, by my fay! if crouching pleases thee, Do it thyself. [Going up proudly to Maclean. Maclean; thy father put into these hands The government and guidance of thy nonage. How I the trust fulfill'd, this castle strengthen'd With walls and added towers, and stored, besides, With arms and trophies in rough warfare won From even the bravest of our western clans, Will testify. What I in recompense Have for my service earn'd, these galled wrists [Pushing up the sleeve from his arm. Do also testify.âSuch as I am, For an old friend I plainly beg this grace: Say if my boon be granted or denied. Mac. The man for whom thou pleadst is most unworthy; Yet let him safely from my shores depart: I harm him not. Ben. (turning from him indignantly). My suit is then denied. [To Lochtarish and Glenfadden. Go ye to Dura's Allen; near the shore He harbours in his aged mother's cot; Bid him upon the ocean drift again His shatter'd boat, and be a wanderer still. Helen (coming forward eagerly). His aged mother! (To Maclean.) Oh! and shall he go? No, no, he shall not! On this day of joy, Wilt thou to me refuse it? [Hanging upon him with looks of entreaty, till, seeing him relent, she then turns joyfully to Benlora. Bid your wanderer Safe with his aged mother still remain,â A banish'd man no more. Mac. This is not well: but be it as thou wilt; Thou hast prevail'd, my Helen. Loch. and Glen. (bowing low). We thank thee, lady. [Benlora bows slightly, in sullen silence. Mac. (to Benlora). Then let thy friend remain; he has my pardon. [Benlora bows again in silence. Clear up thy brow, Benlora; he is pardon'd. [Pauses, but Benlora is still silent. We trust to meet you shortly in the hall; And there, my friends, shall think our happy feast More happy for your presence. [Going up again, with anxious courtesy, to Benlora. Thy past services, Which great and many are, my brave Benlora, Shall be remember'd well. Thou hast my honour, And high regard. Helen. And mine to boot, good kinsman, if the value You put upon them makes them worth the having. Ben. (bows sullenly and retires; then muttering aside to himself as he goes out). Good kinsman! good Benlora! gracious words From this most high and potent dame, vouchsafed To one so poor and humble as myself. [Exit. Loch. (aside to Glenfadden). But thou forgettestâ Glen. (aside to Lochtarish). No; I'll stay behind, And move Maclean to join our nightly meeting. Midnight the hour when you desire his presence? Loch. Yes, even so; then will we be prepared. [Exit. Glen. (returning to Maclean). Chieftain, I would some words of privacy Speak with you, should your leisure now permit. Mac. Come to my closet, then, I'll hear thee gladly. [Exeunt Maclean and Glenfadden. Helen (to Rosa, who now comes forward). Where hast thou been, my Rosa, with my boy, Have they with wild flowers deck'd his cradle round? And peeps he through them like a little nestlingâ A little heath-cock broken from its shell, That through the bloom puts forth its tender beak, As steals some rustling footstep on its nest? Come, let me go and look upon him. Soon, Ere two months more go by, he'll look again In answer to my looks, as though he knew The wistful face that looks so oft upon him, And smiles so dearly, is his mother's. Thinkst thou He'll soon give heed and notice to my love? Rosa. I doubt it not: he is a lively infant, And moves his little limbs with vigour, spreading His fingers forth, as if in time they would A good claymore clench bravely. Helen. A good claymore clench bravely!âO! to see him A man!âa valiant youth!âa noble chieftain! And laying on his plaided shoulder, thus, A mother's hand, say proudly, âThis is mine!â I shall not then a lonely stranger be 'Mid those who bless me not: I shall not thenâ But silent be my tongue. [Weeps. Rosa. Dear madam, still in hope look forward cheerly. [Morton comes from the bottom of the stage. And here is Morton, with some tidings for you: God grant they comfort you!âI must withdraw: His wary faithfulness mistrusts my love, But I am not offended. [Offering to retire. Helen. Nay, remain. [Beckoning her back. Say what thou hast to say, my worthy Morton, For Rosa is as faithful as thyself. Mor. This morning, lady, 'mongst the farther cliffs, Dress'd like a fisher peasant, did I see The Lord of Lorne, your brother. Helen. Ha! sayst thou, The Lord of Lorne, my brother?âThou'rt deceived. Morton. No, no: in vain his sordid garb concealed him! His noble form and stately step I knew Before he spoke. Helen. He spoke to thee? Morton. He did. Helen. Was he alone? Morton. He was; but, near at hand, Another stranger, noble as himself, And in like garb disguised, amongst the rocks I mark'd, though he advanced not. Helen. Alas, alas, my brother! why is this? He spoke to thee, thou saystâI mean my brother: What did he say? Morton. He earnestly entreats To see you privately; and bids you say When this may be. Meantime he lies conceal'd Where I may call him forth at your command. Helen. O, why disguised?âThinkst thou he is not safe? Morton. Safe in his hiding-place he is: but yet The sooner he shall leave this coast, the better. Helen. To see him thus! O, how I am beset! Tell him at twilight, in my nurse's chamber, I will receive him. But be sure thou add, Himself alone will I receiveâaloneâ With no companion must he come. Forget not To say, that I entreat it earnestly. Morton. I will remember this. Helen. Go to him quickly then: and, till the hour, Still do thou hover near him. Watch his haunt, Lest some rude fisherman or surly hind Surprise him. Go thou quickly. O, be prudent! And be not for a moment off the watch. Morton. Madam, I will obey you: trust me well. [Exit. Helen (much disturbed). My brother on the coast; and with him too, As well I guess, the man I must not see! Rosa. Mean you the brave Sir Hubert? Helen. Yes, my Rosa. My noble brother in his powerful self So strong in virtue stands, he thinks full surely The daughter of his sire no weakness hath; And wists not how a simple heart must struggle To be what it would beâwhat it must beâ Ay, and so aid me, heaven! what it shall be. Rosa. And heaven will aid you, madam, doubt it not. Though on this subject still you have repress'd All communing, yet, ne'ertheless, I well Have mark'd your noble striving, and revered Your silent inward warfare, bravely held; In this more pressing combat firm and valiant, As is your noble brother in the field. Helen. I thank thee, gentle Rosa; thou art kindâ I should be franker with thee; but I know notâ Something restrains me here. [Laying her hand on her heart. I love and trust thee; And on thy breast I'll weep when I am sad; But ask not why I weep. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. An apartment in twilight, almost dark; the door of an inner chamber, standing a little ajar, at the bottom of the stage. Enter John of Lorne and Sir Hubert de Grey, disguised as peasants. De Grey. Nay, stop, I pray; advance we not too far? Lorne. Morton hath bid us in this place to wait. The nurse's chamber is adjoining to it; And, till her light within give notice, here Thou mayst remain; when I am call'd, thou'lt leave me. De Grey. Till thou art call'd! and may I stay to hear The sweetness of her voiceâher footstep's sound; Perhaps snatch in the torch's hasty light One momentary vision of that formâ The form that hath to me of earthly make No fellow? May it be without transgression? Lorne. Why shouldst thou not? De Grey, thou art too fearful; Here art thou come with no dishonest will; And well she knows thine honour. Her commands, Though we must yield to them, capricious seem; Seeing thou art with me, too nicely scrupulous; And therefore need no farther be obey'd Than needs must be. She puts thee not on honour. Were I so usedâ De Grey. 'Spite of thy pride, wouldst thou Revere her still the more.âO, no, brave Lorne, I blame her not. When she, a willing victim, To spare the blood of two contending clans, Against my faithful love her suffrage gave, I bless'd her; and the deep, but chasten'd sorrow With which she bade meâOh! that word! farewell, Is treasured in my bosom as its share Of all that earthly love hath power to give. It came from Helen, and, from her received, Shall not be worn with thankless dull repining. Lorne. A noble heart thou hast: such manly meekness Becomes thy gen'rous nature. But for me, More fierce and wilful, sorely was I chafed To see thy faithful heart robb'd of its hope, All for the propping up a hollow peace Between two warlike clans, who will, as long As bagpipes sound, and blades flash to the sun, Delighting in the noble sport of war, Some fierce opponents find. What doth it boot, If men in fields must fight, and blood be shed, What clans are in the ceaseless strife opposed? De Grey. Ah, John of Lorne! too keenly is thy soul To war inclinedâto wasteful, ruthless war. Lorne. The warlike minstrel's rousing lay thou lov'st: Shall bards i' the hall sing of our fathers' deeds To lull their sons to sleep? Vain simple wish! I love to hear the sound of holy bell, And peaceful men their praises lift to heaven: I love to see around their blazing fire The peasant and his cheerful family set, Eating their fearless meal. But, when the roar Of battle rises, and the closing clans, Dark'ning the sun-gleam'd heath, in dread affray Are mingled; blade with blade, and limb with limb, Nerve-strain'd, in terrible strength; yea, soul with soul Nobly contending; who would raise aloft The interdicting hand, and say, âBe still'd?â If this in me be sin, may heaven forgive me! That being am not I. De Grey. In very deed This is thy sin; and of thy manly nature The only blemish worthy of that name. More peaceful be, and thou wilt be more noble. Lorne. Well, here we will not wrangle for the point. None in th'embattled field who have beheld Hubert de Grey in mailed hauberk fight, Will guess how much that knight in peace delights. Still burns my heart that such a man as thou Wast for this weak, unsteady, poor Macleanâ De Grey. Nay, with contempt, I pray thee, name him not. Her husband, and despised! O, no, no, no! All that pertains to her, e'en from that hour, Honour'd and sacred is. Lorne. Thou gen'rous heart! more noble than myself! I will not grieve thee.âI'll to Helen go, With every look and word that might betray Indignant thoughts, or wound her gentle spirit, Strictly suppress'd: and to her ear will give Thy gen'rous greetings, and thy manly words Of cheering comfort;âall most faithfully Shall be remember'd. De Grey. Ay, and my request. Lorne. To see the child? De Grey. E'en so: to look upon it;â Upon the thing that is of her; this budâ This seedling of a flower so exquisite. [Light is seen in the inner chamber. Ha! light is in the chamber! moves the door? Some one approaches. O! but for a moment Let me behind thy friendly tartans be, And snatch one glance of what that light will give. [Conceals himself behind Lorne, who steps some paces back, setting his hand to his side, and tilting his plaid over his arms to favour him; while the door of the inner chamber opens, and Helen appears, bearing a lamp, which she afterwards sets upon a stone slab as she advances. Her formâher motionâyea, that mantled arm, Press'd closely to her breast, as she was wont When chilly winds assail'd.âThe faceâO, woe is me! It was not then so pale. Lorne (to him, in a low voice). Begone: begone. De Grey. Blest vision, I have seen thee! Fare thee well! [Exit in haste. Helen (coming forward, alarmed). What sound is that of steps that hasten from us? Is Morton on the watch. Lorne. Fear nothing; faithful Morton is at hand: The steps thou heardst were friendly. Helen (embracing Lorne). My brother! meet we thus,âdisguised, by stealth? Is this like peace? How is my noble father? Hath any ill befallen? Lorne. Argyll is well; And nothing ill, my sister, hath befallen, If thou art well and happy. Helen. Speakst thou truly? Why art thou come? Why thus upon our coast? O take it not unkindly that I say, âWhy art thou come?â Lorne. Near to the opposite shore, With no design, but on a lengthen'd chase, A lusty deer pursuing from the hills Of Morven, where Sir Hubert and myself Guests of the social lord two days had been, We found us; when a sudden strong desire To look upon the castle of Maclean, Seen from the coast, our eager fancy seized, And that indulged, forthwith we did agree The frith to cross, and to its chief and dame A hasty visit make. But as our boat Lay waiting to receive us, warn'd by one Whom well I knew (the vassal of a friend Whose word I could not doubt), that jealous rancour, Stirr'd up amongst the vassals of Maclean, Who, in their savage fury, had been heard To utter threats against thy innocent self, Made it unsafe in open guise to venture, Here in this garb we are to learn in secret The state in which thou art.âHow is it then? Morton's report has added to my fears: All is not well with thee. Helen. No, all is well. Lorne. A cold constrained voice that answer gave: All is not well.âMacleanâdares he neglect thee? Helen. Nay, wrong him not; kind and affectionate He still remains. Lorne. But it is said, his vassals with vile names Have dared to name thee, even in open clan: And have remain'd unpunish'd. Is it so? [Pauses for an answer, but she is silent. All is not well. Helen. Have I not said it is? Lorne. Ah! dost thou thus return a brother's love With cold reserve?âO speak to me, my Helen! Speak as a sister should.âHave they insulted thee? Has any wrongâmy heart within me burns If I but think upon it.âAnswer truly. Helen. What, am I question'd then? Thinkst thou to find me Like the spoil'd heiress of some Lowland lord, Peevish and dainty; who, with scorn regarding The ruder home she is by marriage placed in, Still holds herself an alien from its interest, With poor repining, losing every sense Of what she is, in what she has been? No.â I love thee, Lorne; I love my father's house: The meanest cur that round his threshold barks Is in my memory as some kindred thing: Yet take it not unkindly when I say, The lady of Maclean no grievance hath To tell the Lord of Lorne. Lorne. And has the vow, Constrain'd, unblest, and joyless as it was, Which gave thee to a lord unworthy of thee, Placed thee beyond the reach of kindred tiesâ The warmth of blood to bloodâthe sure affection That nature gives to allâa brother's love? No, by all sacred things! here is thy hold: Here is thy true, unshaken, native stay: One that shall fail thee never, though the while, A faithless, wavering, intervening band Seems to divide thee from it. [Grasping her hand vehemently, as if he would lead her away. Helen. What dost thou mean? What violent grasp is this? Com'st thou to lead me from my husband's house, Beneath the shade of night, with culprit stealth? Lorne. No, daughter of Argyll; when John of Lorne Shall come to lead thee from these hated walls Back to thy native home,âwith culprit stealth, Beneath the shades of night, it shall not be. With half our western warriors at his back, He'll proudly come. Thy listening timid chief Shall hear our martial steps upon his heath, With heavy measured fall, send, beat by beat, From the far-smitten earth, a sullen sound, Like deep-dell'd forests groaning to the strokes Of lusty woodmen. On the watch-tower's height, His straining eye shall mark our sheathless swords From rank to rank their lengthen'd blaze emit, Like streams of shiv'ring light, in hasty change, Upon the northern firmament.âBy stealth! No! not by stealth!âbelieve me, not by stealth Shalt thou these portals pass. Helen. Them have I enter'd, The pledge of peace: and here my place I'll hold As dame and mistress of the warlike clan Who yield obedience to their chief, my lord; And whatsoe'er their will to me may bear, Of good or ill, so will I hold me ever. Yea, did the Lord of Lorne, dear as he is, With all the warlike Campbells at his back Here hostile entrance threaten; on these walls, Failing the strength that might defend them better, I would myself, while by my side in arms One valiant clan's-man stood, against his powers, To the last push, with desp'rate opposition, This castle hold. Lorne. And wouldst thou so? so firm and valiant art thou? Forgive me, noble creature!âOh! the fateâ The wayward fate that binds thy gen'rous soul To poor unsteady weakness! Helen. Speakst thou thus? Thus pressing still upon the galled spot? Thou dealst unkindly with me. Yes, my brother, Unkindly and unwisely. Wherefore hast thou Brought to this coast the man thou knowest well I ought not in mysterious guise to see? And he himselfâseeks he again to move The hapless weakness I have striv'n to conquer? I thought him generous. Lorne. So think him still. His wishes tend not to disturb thy peace: Far other are his thoughts.âHe bids me tell thee To cheer thy gentle heart, nor think of him, As one who will in vain and stubborn grief His ruin'd bliss lament,âhe bids me say That he will even strive, if it be possible, Amongst the maidens of his land to seek Some faint resemblance of the good he lost, That thou mayst hear of him with less regret, As one by holy bands link'd to his kind. He bids me say, should ever child of his And child of thineâbut here his quivering lip And starting tears spoke what he could not speak. Helen. O noble, gen'rous heart; and does he offer Such cheering manly comfort? Heaven protect, And guide, and bless him! On his noble head Such prosp'rous bliss be pour'd, that hearing of it Shall, through the gloom of my untoward state, Like gleams of sunshine break, that from afar Look o'er the dull dun heath. Lorne. But one requestâ Helen. Ha! makes he one? Lorne. It is to see thy child. Helen. To see my child! Will he indeed regard it? Shall it be bless'd by him? Enter Morton in haste. Morton. Conceal yourself, my lord, or by this passage [Pointing off the stage. The nearest postern gain: I hear the sound Of heavy steps at hand, and voices stern. Helen. O fly, my brother! Morton will conduct thee. (To Morton.) Where is Sir Hubert? Morton. Safe he is without. Helen. Heaven keep him so! (To Lorne.) O leave me! I, the while, Will in, and, with mine infant in mine arms, Meet thee again, ere thou depart.âFly! fly! [Exeunt; Helen into the inner chamber, putting out the lamp as she goes, and Lorne and Morton by a side passage. SCENE II. A cave, lighted by flaming brands fixed aloft on its rugged sides, and shedding a fierce glaring light down upon the objects below. Lochtarish, Benlora, Glenfadden, with several of the chief vassals of Maclean, are discovered in a recess, formed by projecting rocks, at the bottom of the stage, engaged in earnest discourse, from which they move forward slowly, speaking as they advance. Loch. And thus ye see, by strong necessity, We are compell'd to this. 1st vas. Perhaps thou'rt right. Loch. Sayst thou perhaps? Dost thou not plainly see That ne'er a man amongst us can securely His lands possess, or say, âMy house is mine,â While, under tutorage of proud Argyll, This beauteous sorceress our besotted chief By soft enchantment holds? [Laying his hand on the 1st vassal. My brave Glenore, What are thy good deserts, that may uphold thee In favour with a Campbell?âDuncan's blood, Slain in his boat, with all its dashing oars Skirting our shore, while that his vaunting piper The Campbell's triumph play'd? Will this speak for thee? [Turning to 2d vassal. And, Thona, what good merit pleadest thou? The coal-black steed of Clone, thy moonlight plunder, Ta'en from the spiteful laird, will he, good sooth! Neigh favour on thee? [To 3d vassal. And my valiant Fallen, Bethink thee well if fair-hair'd Flora's cries Whom from her native bower by force thou tookst, Will plead for thee.âAnd say ye still perhapsâ Perhaps there is necessity? 1st vas. Strong should it be, Lochtarish; for the act Is fell and cruel thou wouldst push us to. Glen. (to 1st vas.) Ha, man of mercy! are thy lily hands From bloody taint unstain'd? What sights were those Thou look'dst upon in Brunock's burning tower, When infants through the flames their wailings sent, And yet unaided perish'd? Loch. (soothingly). Tush, Glenfadden! Too hasty art thou. (To the vassals.) Ye will say, belike, âOur safetyâour existence did demand Utter extinction of that hold of foes.â And well ye may.âA like necessity Compels us now, and yet ye hesitate. Glen. Our sighted seers the fun'ral lights have seen, Not moving onward in the wonted path On which by friends the peaceful dead are borne, But hov'ring o'er the heath like countless stars, Spent and extinguish'd on the very spot Where first they twinkled. This too well foreshows Interment of the slain, whose bloody graves Of the same mould are made on which they fell. 2d vas. Ha! so indeed! some awful tempest gathers. 1st vas. What sighted man hath seen it? Glen. He whose eye Can see on northern waves the found'ring bark, With all her shrieking crew, sink to the deep, While yet, with gentle winds, on dimpling surge She sails from port in all her gallant trim: John of the Isle hath seen it. Omnes (starting back). Then hangs some evil over us. Glen. Know ye not The mermaid hath been heard upon our rocks? Omnes (still more alarmed). Ha! when? Glen. Last night, upon the rugged crag That lifts its dark head through the cloudy smoke Of dashing billows, near the western cliff. Sweetly, but sadly, o'er the stilly deep The passing sound was borne. I need not say How fatal to our clan that boding sound Hath ever been. 3d vas. In faith thou makest me quake. 2d vas. Some fearful thing hangs o'er us. 1st vas. If 'tis fated Our clan before our ancient foe shall fall, Can we heav'n's will prevent? Why should we then The Campbells' wrath provoke? Ben. (stepping up fiercely to 1st vassal). Heav'n's will preventâthe Campbells' ire provoke! Is such base tameness utter'd by the son Of one, who would into the fiery pit Of damned fiends have leapt, so that his grasp Might pull a Campbell with him? Bastard blood! Thy father spoke not thus. Loch. (soothingly). Nay, brave Benlora, He means not as thou thinkst. Ben. If heaven decree Slaughter and ruin for us, come it then! But let our enemies, close grappled to us, In deadly strife, their ruin join with ours. Let corse to corse, upon the bloody heath, Maclean and Campbell, stiff'ning side by side, With all the gnashing ecstasy of hate Upon their ghastly visages impress'd, Lie horribly!âFor ev'ry widow's tear Shed in our clan, let matron Campbells howl! Loch. Indeed, my friends, although too much in ire, Benlora wisely speaks.âShall we in truth Wait for our ruin from a crafty foe, Who here maintains this keenly watchful spy In gentle kindness masked? Glen. Nor need we fear, As good Lochtarish hath already urged, Her death will rouse Argyll. It will be deem'd, As we shall grace it with all good respect Of funeral pomp, a natural visitation. Loch. Ay, and besides, we'll swear upon the book, And truly swear, if we are call'd upon, We have not shed her blood. Ben. I like not this. If ye her life will take, in open day Let her a public sacrifice be made. Let the loud trumpet far and near proclaim Our bloody feast, and at the rousing sound, Let every clans-man of the hated name His vengeful weapon clench.â I like it not, Lochtarish. What we do, Let it be boldly done.âWhy should we slay her? Let her in shame be from the castle sent; Which, to her haughty sire, will do, I ween, Far more despite than taking of her life.â A feeble woman's life!âI like it not. [Turning on his heel angrily, and striding to the bottom of the stage. Loch. (aside to Glen.) Go to him, friend, and soothe him to our purpose. The fiery fool! how madly wild he is! [Glenfadden goes to the bottom of the stage, and is seen remonstrating, in dumb-show, with Benlora, while Lochtarish speaks to the vassals on the front. Loch. My friends, why on each other look ye thus In gloomy silence? freely speak your thoughts. Mine have I freely spoken: that advising Which for the goodânay, I must say existence, Of this our ancient clan most needful is. When did Lochtarish ever for himself A separate 'vantage seek, in which the clan At large partook not? Am I doubted now? 2d vas. No, nothing do we doubt thy public zeal. Loch. Then is my long experience o' the sudden To childish folly turn'd? Thinkst thou, good Thona, We should beneath this artful mistress live, Hush'd in deceitful peace, till John of Lorne, For whom the office of a treacherous spy She doth right slily manage, with his powers Shall come upon us? Once ye would have spurn'd At thoughts so base; but now, when forth I stand To do what vengeance, safety, nay, existence, All loudly call for; even as though already The enemy's baleful influence hung o'er you, Like quell'd and passive men ye silent stand. 1st vas. (roused). Nay, cease, Loctarish! quell'd and passive men Thou knowst we are not. Loch. Yet a woman's life, And that a treacherous woman, moves you thus. Bold as your threats of dark revenge have been, A strong decisive deed appals you now. Our chieftain's feeble undetermined spirit Infects you all: ye dare not stand by me. Omnes. We dare not, sayst thou? Loch. Dare not, will I say! Well spoke the jeering Camerons, I trow, As past their fishing boats our vessel steer'd, When with push'd lip, and finger pointing thus, They call'd our crew the Campbell-cow'd Macleans. Omnes (roused fiercely). The Campbell-cow'd Macleans! 2d vas. Infernal devils! Dare they to call us so? Loch. Ay, by my truth! Nor think that from the Camerons alone Ye will such greeting have, if back ye shrink, And stand not by me now. Omnes (eagerly). We'll stand!âWe'll stand! 2d vas. Tempt us not more. There's ne'er a man of us That will not back thee boldly. Loch. Ay, indeed? Now are ye men! Give me your hands to this. [They all give him their hands. Now am I satisfied. [Looking off the stage. The chief approaches. Ye'know full well the spirit of the man That we must deal withal; therefore be bold. Omnes. Mistrust us not. Enter Maclean, who advances to the middle of the stage, while Lochtarish, Benlora, Glenfadden, and all the other vassals gather round him with stern determined looks. A pause; Maclean eyeing them all round with inquisitive anxiety. Mac. A goodly meeting at this hour convened. [A sullen pause. Benlora; Thona; Allen of Glenore; And all of you, our first and bravest kinsmen; What mystery in this sullen silence is? Hangs any threaten'd evil o'er the clan? Ben. Yes, chieftain; evil, that doth make the blood Within your grey-hair'd warriors' veins to burn, And their brogued feet to spurn the ground that bears them. Loch. Evil, that soon will wrap your tower in flames, Your ditches fill with blood, and carrion birds Glut with the butcher'd corses of your slain. Glen. Ay; evil, that doth make the hoary locks Of sighted men around their age-worn scalps Like quicken'd points of crackling flame to rise; Their teeth to grind, and strained eye-balls roll In fitful frenzy, at the horrid things, In terrible array before them raised. 1st vas. The mermaid hath been heard upon our rocks: The fatal song of waves. Glen. The northern deep Is heard with distant moanings from our coast, Uttering the dismal bodeful sounds of death. 2d vas. The funeral lights have shone upon our heath, Marking in countless groups the graves of thousands. Ben. Yea, chief; and sounds like to thy father's voice Have from the sacred mould wherein he lies, At dead of night, by wakeful men been heard Three times distinctly. [Turning to Glenfadden. Saidst thou not thrice? Glen. Yes; three times heard distinctly. Mac. Ye much amaze me, friends.âSuch things have been? Loch. Yea, chief; and thinkst thou we may lightly deem Of coming ills, by signs like these forewarn'd? Mac. Then an it be, high heav'n have mercy on us! Loch. (in a loud solemn voice). Thyself have mercy on us! Mac. How is this? Your words confuse and stun me.âHave I power To ward this evil off? Omnes. Thou hast! thou hast! Mac. Then God to me show mercy in my need, As I will do for you and for my clan Whate'er my slender power enables me. Omnes. Amen! and swear to it. Mac. (starting back). What words are these, With such wild fierceness utter'd? name the thing That ye would have me do. Ben. (stepping out from the rest). Ay, we will name it. Helen the Campbell, foster'd in your bosom, A serpent is, who wears a hidden sting For thee and all thy name; the oath-bound spy Of dark Argyll, our foe; the baleful plague To which ill-omen'd sounds and warnings point, As that on which existence or extinctionâ The name and being of our clan depend;â A witch of deep seduction.âCast her forth. The strange, unnatural union of two bloods, Adverse and hostile, most abhorred is. The heart of every warrior of your name Rises against it. Yea, the grave calls out, And says it may not be.âNay, shrink not, chief, When I again repeat it,âcast her off. Mac. Art thou a man? and bidst me cast her off, Bound as I am by sacred holy ties? Loch. Bound as thou art by that which thou regardest As sacred holy ties; what tie so sacred As those that to his name and kindred vassals The noble chieftain bind? If ties there be To these opposed, although a saint from heav'n Had bless'd them o'er the cross'd and holy things, They are annull'd and broken. Ben. Ay, Lochtarish; Sound doctrine hast thou utter'd. Such the creed Of ancient warriors was, and such the creed That we their sons will with our swords maintain. [Drawing his sword fiercely, whilst the rest follow his example. Mac. Ye much confound me with your violent words. I can in battle strive, as well ye know: But how to strive with you, ye violent men, My spirit knows not. Loch. Decideâdecide, Maclean: the choice is thine To be our chieftain, leading forth thy bands, As heretofore thy valiant father did, Against our ancient foe, or be the husband, Despised, forsaken, cursed, of her thou prizest More than thy clan and kindred. Glen. Make thy choice. Benlora, wont in better times to lead us Against the Campbells, with a chieftain's power, Shall, with the first blast of his warlike horn, If so he will it, round his standard gather Thy roused and valiant vassals to a man. Mac. (greatly startled). Ha! go your thoughts to this? Desert me so? My vassals so desert me? Loch. Ay, by my faith, our very women too: And in your hall remain, to serve your state, Nor child nor aged crone. Mac. (after great agitation). Decide, and cast her off!âHow far the thoughts To which these words ye yoke may go, I guess not. (Eagerly.) They reach not to her life? [Pauses and looks at them anxiously, but they are silent. Oh, oh! oh, oh! that stern and dreadful silence! Loch. We will not shed her blood. Mac. Then ye will spare her? Loch. Commit her to our keeping: ask us not How we shall deal with her. Mac. Some fearful mystery is in your words, Which covers cruel things. O woe the day, That I on this astounding ridge am poised! On every side a fearful ruin yawns. [A voice heard without, uttering wild incoherent words, mixed with shrieks of horror. What frenzied voice is that? Enter 4th vassal, as if terribly frightened. Loch. (to 4th vas.) What brings thee hither? 4th vas. He fixes wildly on the gloomy void His starting eyeballs, bent on fearful sights, That make the sinews of his aged limbs In agony to quiver. Loch. Who didst thou say? 4th vas. John of the Isle, the sighted awful man. Go, see yourselves: i' the outer cave he is. Entranced he stands; arrested on his way By horrid visions, as he hurried hither Enquiring for the chief. [Voice heard without, as before. Loch. Hark! hark, again! dread powers are dealing with him. Come, chieftainâcome and see the awful man. If heaven or hell hath power to move thy will, Thou canst not now withstand us. (Pausing for him to go.) Hearst thou not? And motionless? Mac. I am beset and stunn'd, And every sense bewilder'd. Violent men! If ye unto this fearful pitch are bent,â When such necessity is press'd upon me, What doth avail resistance? Woe the day! Even lead me where ye will. [Exit Maclean, exhausted and trembling, leaning on Lochtarish, and followed by Benlora and Glenfadden and vassals; two inferior vassals alone left upon the stage. 1st vas. (looking after Maclean). Ay, there he goes; so spent, and scared, and feeble! Without a prophet's skill, we may foretell, John of the Isle, by sly Lochtarish taught, Will work him soon to be an oath-bound wretch To this their fell design.âAre all things ready? 2d vas. All is in readiness. 2st vas. When ebbs the tide? 2d vas. At early dawn, when in the narrow creek Near to the castle, with our trusty mates, Our boat must be in waiting to receive her. 1st vas. The time so soon! alas, so young and fair! That slow and dismal death! To be at once Plunged in the closing deep many have suffer'd, But to sit waiting on a lonely rock For the approaching tide to throttle herâ But that she is a Campbell, I could weep. 2d vas. Weep, fool! think soon how we'll to war again With our old enemy; and, in the field, Our good claymores die with their hated blood: Think upon this, and change thy tears to joy. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The bed-chamber of Maclean. Enter Maclean, followed by Helen. Helen. Ah! wherefore art thou so disturb'd? the night Is almost spent: the morn will break ere long, And rest hast thou had none. Go to thy bed: I pray thee, go. Mac. I cannot: urge me not. Helen. Nay, try to rest: I'll sit and watch by thee. Mac. Thou'lt sit and watch! O woe betide the hour! And who will watch for thee? Helen. And why for me? Can any harm approach? When thou art near, Or sleeping or awake, I am secure. Mac. (pacing to and fro distractedly). O God! O God! Helen. Those exclamations! [Going up to him, while he avoids her. Turnst thou from me thus? Have I offended? dost thou doubt my faith? Hath any jealous thoughtâI freely own Love did not make me thine: but, being thine, To no love-wedded dame, bound in the ties Of dearest sympathy, will I in dutyâ In steady, willing, cheerful duty yield. Yea, and though here no thrilling rapture be, I look to spend with thee, by habit foster'd, The evening of my days in true affection. Mac. The evening of thy days! alas, alas! Would heaven had so decreed it! [Pulling away his hand from hers. Grasp me not! It is a fiend thou clingst to. [A knock at the door. Power of heaven! Are they already at the chamber door! Helen. Are those who knock without unwelcome?âhush! Withdraw thyself, and I will open to them. [Goes to the door. Mac. O go not! go not! [Runs after her to draw her back, when a vassal, rushing from behind the bed, lays hold of him. Vas. Art thou not sworn to us? Where is thy faith? Mac. I know, I know! the bands of hell have bound me. O fiends! ye've made of meâwhat words can speak The hateful wretch I am! Hark! hark! she cries! She shrieks and calls on me! [Helen 's cries heard without, first near and distinct, afterwards more and more distant as they bear her away; while the vassal leads Maclean forcibly off the stage by the opposite side, he breaks from him, and hastens towards that by which Helen went out. Vas. Thou art too strong for me. Do as thou wilt; But if thou bringst her back, even from that moment Benlora is our leader, and thyself, The Campbell's husband, chieftain and Maclean No more shalt be. We've sworn as well as thou. [Maclean stops irresolutely, and then suffers the vassal to lead him off by the opposite side. ACT III. SCENE I. A small island, composed of a rugged craggy rock, on the front of the stage, and the sea in the background. Enter two vassals dragging in Helen, as if just come out of their boat. Helen. O why is this? Speak, gloomy, ruthless men! Our voyage ends not here? 1st vas. It does: and now, Helen the Campbell, fare theeâ fare there well! 2d vas. Helen the Campbell, thy last greeting take From mortal thing. Helen. What! leave me on this rock, This sea-girt rock, to solitude and famine? 1st vas. Next rising tide will bring a sure relief To all the ills we leave thee. Helen (starting). I understand you. [Raising her clasped hands to heaven. Lord of heaven and earth; Of storms and tempests, and th' unfathom'd deep; Is this thy righteous will? [Grasping the hands of the men imploringly Ye cannot mean it! Ye cannot leave a human creature thus To perish by a slow approaching end, So awful and so terrible! Instant death Were merciful to this. 1st vas. If thou prefer it, we can shorten well Thy term of pain and terror: from this crag, Full fourteen fathom deep thou mayst be plunged. In shorter time than three strokes of an oar Thy pains will cease. 2d vas. Come, that were better for thee. [Both of them take her hands, and are going to hurry her to the brink of the rock, when she shrinks back. Helen. O no! the soul recoils from swift destruction! Pause ye awhile. [Considering for a moment. The downward terrible plunge! The coil of whelming waves!âO fearful nature! [Catching hold of a part of the rock near her. To the rough rock I'll cling: it still is something Of firm and desp'rate holdâDepart and leave me. [Waving her hand for the vassals to go, whilst she keeps close hold of the rock with the other. 1st vas. Thou still mayst live within a prison pent, If life be dear to thee. Helen (eagerly). If life be dear!âAlas, it is not dear! Although the passing fearful act of death So very fearful is.âSay how, even in a prison, I still may wait my quiet natural end. 1st vas. Whate'er thou art, such has thy conduct been, Thy wedded faith, e'en with thy fellest foes, Sure and undoubted stands:âSign thou this scroll, Owning the child, thy son, of bastard birth; And this made sure, Lochtarish bade me say Thy life shall yet be spared. Helen (pushing him away with indignation as he offers her the scroll). Off, off, vile agent of a wretch so devilish! Now do I see from whence my ruin comes: I and my infant foil his wicked hopes. O harmless babe! will heav'n abandon thee? It will not!âNo; it will not! [Assuming firmness and dignity. Depart and leave me. In my rising breast I feel returning strength. Heav'n aids my weakness: I'll meet its awful will. [Waving them off with her hand. 1st vas. Well, in its keeping rest thee: fare thee well, Helen the Campbell! 2d vas. Be thy suff'rings short! (Aside to the other.) Come, quickly let us go, nor look behind. Fell is the service we are put upon: Would we had never ta'en that cruel oath! [Exeunt vassals. Helen (alone, after standing some time gazing round her, paces backwards and forwards with agitated steps, then, stopping suddenly, bends her ear to the ground as if she listened earnestly to something). It is the sound; the heaving hollow swell That notes the turning tide.âTremendous agent! Mine executioner, that, step by step, Advances to the awful work of death.â Onward it wears: a little space removed The dreadful conflict is. [Raising her eyes to heaven, and moving her lips, as in the act of devotion, before she again speaks aloud. Thou art i' the blue coped skyâth' expanse immeasurable; I' the dark roll'd clouds, the thunder's awful home: Thou art i' the wide-shored earth,âthe pathless desert; And in the dread immensity of waters,â I' the fathomless deep Thou art. Awful but excellent! beneath Thy hand, With trembling confidence, I bow me low, And wait Thy will in peace. [Sits down on a crag of the rock, with her arms crossed over her breast in silent resignation; then, after a pause of some length, raises her head hastily. Is it a sound of voices in the wind? The breeze is on the rock: a gleam of sunshine Breaks through those farther clouds. It is like hope Upon a hopeless state. [Starting up, and gazing eagerly around her. I'll to that highest crag and take my stand: Some little speck upon the distant wave May to my eager gaze a vessel growâ Some onward wearing thing,âsome boatâsome raftâ Some drifted plank.âO hope! thou quitt'st us never! [Exit, disappearing amongst the rugged divisions of the rock. SCENE II. A small island, from which the former is seen in the distance, like a little pointed rock standing out of the sea. Enter Sir Hubert de Grey, followed by two fishermen. De Grey. This little swarded spot, that o'er the waves, Cloth'd in its green light, seem'd to beckon to us, Right pleasant is: until our comrades join, Here will we rest. I marvel much they stand So far behind. In truth, such lusty rowers Put shame upon their skill. 1st fish. A cross-set current bore them from the track, But see, they now bear on us rapidly. (Voices without.) Holla! 2d fish. They call to us.âHolla! holla! How fast they wear! they are at hand already. De Grey. Right glad I am: the Lord of Lorne, I fear, Will wait impatiently: he has already With rapid oars the nearer mainland gain'd, Where he appointed us to join him.âHo! [Calling off the stage. Make to that point, my lads. (To those near him.) Here, for a little while, upon the turf We'll snatch a hasty meal, and, so refresh'd, Take to our boats again. Enter three other Fishermen, as from their boat, on the other side of the stage. Well met, my friends! I'm glad you're here at last. How was it that you took that distant track? 3d fish. The current bore us wide of what we wist; And, were it not your honour is impatient Mainland to make, we had not come so soon. De Grey. What had detain'd you? 3d fish. As near you rock we bore, that o'er the waves Just shows its jetty point, and will, ere long, Beneath the tide be hidd'n, we heard the sound Of feeble lamentation. De Grey. A human voice? 3d fish. I cannot think it was; For on that rock, sea-girt, and at high tide Sea-cover'd, human thing there cannot be; Though, at the first, it sounded in our ears Like a faint woman's voice. De Grey. Perceived ye aught? 3d fish. Yes; something white that moved, and, as we think, Some wounded bird that there hath dropp'd its wing, And cannot make its way. 4th fish. Perhaps some dog, Whose master, at low water, there hath been, And left him. 3d fish. Something 'tis in woeful case, Whate'er it be. Right fain I would have gone To bear it off. De Grey (eagerly). And wherefore didst thou not? Return and save it. Be it what it may; Something it is, lone and in jeopardy, Which hath a feeling of its desperate state, And therefore doth to woe-worn, fearful man, A kindred nature bear.âReturn, good friend:â Quickly return and save it, ere the tide Shall wash it from its hold. I to the coast Will steer the while, and wait your coming there. 3d fish. Right gladly, noble sir. 4th fish. We'll gladly go: For, by my faith! at night I had not slept For thinking of that sound. De Grey. Heaven speed you then! whate'er ye bring to me Of living kind, I will reward you for it. Our different tracks we hold; nor longer here Will I remain. Soon may we meet: God speed you! [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A fisherman's house on the mainland. Enter John of Lorne and Sir Hubert de Grey. Lorne. Then wait thou for thy boat; I and my men Will onward to the town, where, as I hope, My trusty vassals and our steeds are station'd. But lose not time. De Grey. Fear not; I'll follow quickly. Lorne. I must unto the castle of Argyll Without delay proceed; therefore, whate'er Of living kind, bird, beast, or creeping thing, This boat of thine produces, bring it with thee; And, were it eaglet fierce, or wolf, or fox, On with us shall it travel, mounted bravely, Our homeward cavalcade to grace. Farewell! De Grey. Farewell, my friend! I shall not long delay Thy homeward journey. Lorne (calling off the stage). But ho! good host and hostess! (To De Grey.) Ere I go I must take leave of honest Duncan here, And of his rosy wife.âAy, here they come. Enter the host and his wife. (To host, &amp;c.) Farewell, my friends, and thanks be to you both! Good cheer, and kindly given, of you we've had. Thy hand, good host. May all the fish o' th' ocean Come crowding to thy nets!âAnd healthy brats, Fair dame, have thou! with such round rosy cheeks As brats of thine befit: and, by your leave, [Kissing her. So be they kiss'd by all kind comers too! Good luck betide you both! Host. And, sir, to you the same. Whoe'er you be, A brave man art thou, that I will be sworn. Wife. Come you this way again, I hope, good sir, You will not pass our door. Lorne. Fear not, good hostess; It is a pleasant, sunny, open door, And bids me enter of its own accord; I cannot pass it by.âGood luck betide you! [Exit, followed to the door by Sir Hubert. Host. I will be sworn it is some noble chieftain, Though homely be his garb. Wife. Ay, so will I: the Lord of Lorne himself Could not more courteous be. Host. Hush! hush! be quiet! We live not now amongst the Campbells, wife. Should some Maclean o'erhear theeâhush, I say. [Eyeing De Grey, who returns from the door. And this man, too; right noble is his mien; He is no common rambler. (To De Grey.) By your leave, If I may be so bold without offending, Your speech, methinks, smacks of a southern race; I guess at least of Lowland kin ye be. But think no shame of this; we'll ne'ertheless Regard thee: thieves and cowards be not all Who from the Lowlands come. Wife. No; no, in sooth! I knew a Lowlander, Some years gone by, who was as true and honestâ Ay, and I do believe well nigh as brave, As though, with brogued feet, he never else Had all his days than muir or mountain trodd'n. De Grey. Thanks for your gentle thoughts!âIt has indeed Been my misluck to draw my earliest breath Where meadows flower, and corn fields wave i' th' sun. But let us still be friends! Heaven gives us not To choose our birth-place, else these wilds, no doubt, Would be more thickly peopled. Host. Ay, true it is, indeed. Wife. And hard it were To quarrel with him too for his misfortune. [Noise heard without. De Grey. Ha! 'tis my boat return'd. Enter 1st Fisherman. 1st fish. Ay, here we are. De Grey. And aught saved from the rock? 1st fish. Yes, by my faith! but neither bird nor beast. Look there, my master. [Pointing to the door. Enter Helen, extremely exhausted, and almost senseless, wrapped closely up in one of their plaids, and supported by the other two Fishermen. De Grey. A woman! Heaven in mercy! was it then A human creature there exposed to perish? 1st fish. (opening the plaid to show her face). Ay, look; and such a creature! De Grey (starting back). Helen of Argyll! O God! was this the feeble wailing voice? [Clasping his arms about her knees, as she stands almost senseless, supported by the fishermen, and bursting into tears. Could heart of man so leave thee? thou, of all That lovely is, most lovely.âWoe is me! Some aid, I pray you. [To host and his wife. Bear her softly in, And wrap warm garments round her. Breathes she freely? Her eyes half open are, but life, alas! Is almost spent, and holds within her breast A weak uncertain seat. [Helen moves her hand. She moves her hand:â She knows my voice.âO heaven, in mercy save her! Bear her more gently, pray you:âSoftly, softly! How weak and spent she is! 1st fish. No marvel she is weak: we reach'd her not Until the swelling waters laved her girdle. And then to see herâ De Grey. Cease, I pray thee, friend, And tell me notâ 2d fish. Nay, faith, he tells you true: She stood above the water, with stretched arms Clung to the dripping rock, like the white pinionsâ De Grey. Peace, peace, I say! thy words are agony:â Give to my mind no image of the thing! [Exeunt, bearing Helen into an inner part of the house. ACT IV. SCENE I. A small Gothic hall, or ante-room, in Argyll's castle, a door at the bottom of the stage, leading to the apartment of the earl, before which is discovered the piper pacing backwards and forwards, playing on his bagpipe. Enter Dugald. Dugald. Now, pray thee, piper, cease! That stunning din Might do good service by the ears to set Two angry clans; but for a morning's rouse, Here at an old man's door, it does, good sooth, Exceed all reasonable use. The Earl Has pass'd a sleepless night: I pray thee now Give o'er, and spare thy pains. Piper. And spare my pains, sayst thou? I'll do mine office, As long as breath within my body is. Dug. Then mercy on us all! if wind thou meanst, There is within that sturdy trunk of thine, Old as it is, a still exhaustless store. A Lapland witch's bag could scarcely match it. Thou couldst, I doubt not, belly out the sails Of a three-masted vessel with thy mouth: But be thy mercy equal to thy might! I pray thee now give o'er: in faith the earl Has pass'd a sleepless night. Piper. Thinkst thou I am a Lowland, day-hired minstrel, To play or stop at bidding? Is Argyll The lord and chieftain of our ancient clan, More certainly, than I to him, as such, The high hereditary piper am? A sleepless night, forsooth! He's slept full oft On the hard heath, with fifty harness'd steeds Champing their fodder round him;âsoundly too. I'll do mine office, loon, chafe as thou wilt. [Continuing to pace up and down, and play as before. Dugald. Nay, thou the chafer art, red-crested cock! The Lord of Lorne has spoilt thee with indulging Thy wilful humours. Cease thy cursed din! See; here the earl himself comes forth to chide thee. [Exit. Enter Argyll, attended, from the chamber. Arg. Good morrow, piper! thou hast roused me bravely: A younger man might gird his tartans on With lightsome heart to martial sounds like these, But I am old. Piper. O no, my noble chieftain! It is not age subdues you. Arg. No; what else? Piper. Alack! the flower and blossom of your house The wind hath blown away to other towers. When she was here, and gladsome faces brighten'd With looking on her, and around your board Sweet lays were sung, and gallants in the hall Footed it trimly to our varied measures, There might, indeed, be found beneath your roof Those who might reckon years fourscore and odds, But of old folks, I warrant, ne'er a soul. No; we were all young then. Arg. (sighing deeply). 'Tis true, indeed, It was even as thou sayst. Our earthly joys Fly like the blossoms scatter'd by the wind. Enter a Servant. Serv. Please you, my lord, Some score of vassals in the hall attend To bid good morrow to you, and the hour Wears late: the chamberlain hath bid me say He will dismiss them, if it please your honour. Arg. Nay, many a mile have some of them, I know, With suit or purpose lurking in their minds, Ridd'n o'er rough paths to see me; disappointed Shall none of them return. I'm better now. I have been rather weary than unwell. Say, I will see them presently. [Exit servant. Re-enter Dugald in haste. (To Dugald.) Thou comest with a busy face: what tidings? Dugald. The Lord of Lorne's arrived, an' please your honour: Sir Hubert too, and all their jolly train; And with them have they brought a lady, closely In hood and mantle muffled: ne'er a glimpse May of her face be seen. Arg. A lady, sayst thou? Dugald. Yes; closely muffled up. Arg. (pacing up and down, somewhat disturbed). I like not this.âIt cannot surely beâ [Stopping short, and looking hard at Dugald. Whence comes he? Dugald. He a-hunting went, I know, To Cromack's ancient laird, whose youthful dame So famed for beauty is; but whence he comes, I cannot tell, my lord. Arg. (pacing up and down, as he speaks to himself in broken sentences, very much disturbed). To Cromack's ancient laird!âIf that indeedâ Beshrew me, if it be!âI'd rather lose Half of my lands, than son of mine such wrong, Such shameful wrong, should do. This sword I've drawn Like robbery to revenge, ne'er to abet it: And shall I now with hoary locksâNo, no!â My noble Lorne! he cannot be so base. Enter Lorne, going up to Argyll with agitation. Arg. (eyeing him suspiciously). Well, John, how is it? Welcome art thou home,} If thou returnst, as well I would believe, Deserving of a welcome. Lorne. Doubts my lord That I am so return'd? [Aside to Argyll, endeavouring to draw him apart from his attendants. Your ear, my father. Let these withdraw: I have a thing to tell you. Arg. (looking still more suspiciously upon Lorne, from seeing the eagerness and agitation with which he speaks, and turning from him indignantly). No, by this honest blade! if wrong thou'st done, Thou hast no shelter here. In open day, Before th' assembled vassals shalt thou tell it; And he whom thou hast injured be redress'd, While I have power to bid my Campbells fight I' the fair and honour'd cause. Lorne. I pray, my lordâ Will you vouchsafe to hear me? Arg. Thoughtless boy! How far unlike the noble Lorne I thought thee!â Proud as I am, far rather would I see thee Join'd to the daughter of my meanest vassal, Than see thy manly, noble worth engaged In such foul raid as this. Lorne. Nay, nay! be pacified! I'd rather take, in faith, the tawny hand Of homeliest maid, that doth, o' holidays, Her sun-burnt locks with worsted ribbon bind, Fairly and freely won, than brightest dame That e'er in stately bower or regal hall In graceful beauty shone, gain'd by such wrongâ By such base treachery as you have glanced at. These are plain words: then treat me like a man, Who hath been wont the manly truth to speak. Arg. Ha! now thy countenance and tone again Are John of Lorne's. That look, and whispering voice, So strange appear'd, in truth I liked it not. Give me thy hand.âWhere is the stranger dame? If she in trouble beâ Lorne (aside). Make these withdraw, And I will lead her hither. [Exit, while the earl waves his hand, and Dugald and attendants, &amp;c. go out: presently re-enter Lorne, leading in Helen, covered closely up in a mantle. Lorne. This is the dame, who, houseless and deserted, Seeks shelter here, nor fears to be rejected. Helen (sinking down, and clasping Argyll 's knees). My father! Arg. That voice!âO God!âunveilâunveil, for mercy! [Tearing off the mantle that conceals her. My child! my Helen! [Clasping her to his heart, and holding her there for some time, unable to speak. My child! my dearest child!âmy soul! my pride! Deserted!âhouseless!âcom'st thou to me thus? Here is thy houseâthy home: this aged bosom Thy shelter is, which thou shalt quit no more. My child! my child! [Embracing her again; Helen and he weeping upon one another's necks. Houseless! desertedâ'neath the cope of heaven Breathes there a wretch who could desert thee?âSpeak, If he hath so abused his precious trust, If heâit makes me tear these hoary locks To think what I have done!âOh thoughtless father! Thoughtless and selfish too! [Tearing his hair, beating his forehead with all the violent gestures of rage and grief. Helen. Oh, oh! forbear! It was not you, my father; I gave myself away: I did it willingly: We acted both for good; and now your love Repays me richlyâstands to me instead Of many blessings.âNoble Lorne, besidesâ O, he hath been to me so kindâso tender! [Taking her brother's hand, and pressing it to her breast; then joining her father's to it, and pressing them both ardently to her lips. Say not I am deserted: heaven hath chid meâ Hath chid me sorely: but hath bless'd me too,â O, dearly bless'd me! Arg. Hath chid thee sorely!âhow I burn to hear it! What hast thou suffer'd? Lorne. We will not tell thee now. Go to thy chamber, And be awhile composed. We have, my father, A tale to tell that will demand of thee Recruited strength to hear.âWe'll follow thee. [Exeunt; Lorne supporting his father and Helen into the chamber. SCENE II. The garden of the castle. Enter Argyll, Lorne, and Sir Hubert de Grey, speaking as they enter. Lorne. A month!âA week or two!âNo, not an hour Would I suspend our vengeance. Such atrocity Makes e'en the little term between our summons, And the dark crowding round our martial pipes Of plumed bonnets nodding to the wind, Most tedious seem; yea, makes the impatient foot To smite the very earth beneath its tread, For being fix'd and inert. Arg. Be less impatient, John: thou canst not doubt A father's keen resentment of such wrong: But let us still be wise; this short delay Will make revenge the surer; to its aim A just direction give. De Grey. The earl is right: We shall but work in the dark, impatient Lorne, If we too soon begin. Arg. How far Maclean Hath to this horrible attempt consented, Or privy been, we may be certified, By waiting silently to learn the tale That he will tell us of his lady's loss, When he shall send to give us notice of it, As doubtless soon he will. De Grey. If he, beset and threaten'd, to those fiends, Unknowing of their purpose, hath unwillingly Committed her, he will himself, belike, If pride prevent him not, your aid solicit To set him free from his disgraceful thraldom. Lorne. And if he should, shrunk be this sinew'd arm, If it unsheath a weapon in his cause! Let ev'ry ragged stripling on his lands In wanton mock'ry mouth him with contempt; Benlora head his vassals; and Lochtarishâ That serpent, full of ev'ry devilish wile, His prison-keeper and his master be! De Grey. Ay; and the keeper also of his son, The infant heir. Lorne (starting). I did not think of this. Arg. Then let thy headstrong fury pause upon it. Thanks to Sir Hubert's prudence! thou as yet Before thy followers hast restrained been; And who this lady is, whom to the castle, Like a mysterious stranger, ye have brought, From them remains conceal'd.âMy brave De Grey! This thy considerate foresight, join'd to all Thy other service in this woeful matter, Hath made us much thy debtor. De Grey. I have indeed, my lord, consider'd only What I believed would Helen's wishes be, Ere she herself could utter them; if this Hath proved equivalent to wiser foresight, Let it direct us still; let Helen's wishes Your measures guide. Arg. Ah, brave De Grey! would they had ever done so! I had not nowâ [Taking Sir Hubert's hand with emotion. Forgive me, noble youth! Alas, alas! the father's tenderness Before the chieftain's policy gave way, And all this wreck hath been. Lorne. 'Tis even so. That cursed peace; that coward's shadeless face Of smiles and promises, to all things yielding With weak, unmanly pliancy, so gain'd youâ Even you, the wise Argyll!âit made me mad! Who hath no point that he maintains against you, No firmness hath to hold him of your side: Who cannot sturdily against me stand, And say, âEncroach no farther,â friend of mine Shall never be. De Grey. Nay, Lorne, forbear!âforbear! Thine own impetuous wilfulness did make The other's pliant mind more specious seem; And thou thyself didst to that luckless union, Although unwittingly, assistance lend. Make now amends for it, and curb thy spirit, While that the Earl with calmer judgment waits His time for action. Lorne. Beshrew me, but thy counsel strangely smacks Of cautious timid age! In faith, De Grey, But that I know thy noble nature well, I could believe theeâ Arg. Peace, unruly spirit! Bold as thou art, methinks, with locks like these, Thy father still may say to thee, âBe silent!â Lorne (checking himself, and bowing very low to Argyll). And be obey'd devoutly.âO forgive me! Those locks are to your brows a kingly fillet Of strong authority, to which my heart No rebel is, though rude may be my words. [Taking Sir Hubert 's hand with an assured countenance. I ask not thee, De Grey, to pardon me. Resistance here with gentleness is join'd: Therefore I've loved thee, and have laid upon thee The hand of sure possession! claiming still A friend's endurance of my froward temper, Which, froward as it is, from thee hath borne What never human being but thyself Had dared to goad it with. De Grey. It is indeed Thy well-earn'd right thou askest, noble Lorne, And it is yielded to thee cheerfully. Arg. My aged limbs are tired with pacing here; Some one approaches: within that grove We'll find a shady seat, and there conclude This well-debated point. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A court within the castle, surrounded with buildings. Enter Dugald and a Vassal, two servants at the same time crossing the stage, with covered dishes in their hands. Vas. I'll wait until the Earl shall be at leisure; My business presses not. Where do they carry Those cover'd meats? Have ye within the castle Some noble prisoner? Dugald. Would so it were! but these are days of peace. They bear them to the stranger dame's apartment, Whom they have told thee of. There, at her door, An ancient faithful handmaid of the house, Whate'er they bring receives; for none beside Of all the household is admitted. Vas. Now, by my fay! my purse and dirk I'd give To know who this may be.âSome chieftain's lady Whom John of Lorneâ Dugald. Nay, there, I must believe, Thou guessest erringly.âI grant, indeed, He doffs his bonnet to each tacks-man's wife, And is with every coif amongst them all, Both young and old, in such high favour held, Nor maiden, wife, nor beldame of the clan But to the Earl doth her petition bring Through intercession of the Lord of Lorne; But never yet did husband, sire, or brother, Of wrong from him complain. Vas. I know it well. Dugald. But be she who she may, This stranger here; I doubt not, friend, ere long, We shall have bickering for her in the field With some fierce foe or other. Vas. So I trust: And by my honest faith! this peace of ours Right long and tiresome isâI thought, ere now, Some of our restless neighbours would have trespass'd And inroads made: but no; Argyll and Lorne Have grown a terror to them: all is quiet; And we ourselves must the aggressors be, Or still this dull and slothful life endure, Which makes our men of three-score years and ten To fret and murmur. Enter Rosa, with a servant conducting her. Serv. (to Dugald). A lady here, would see my Lord of Lorne. Dugald. Yes, still to him they come. [Looking at Rosa. Ha! see I rightly? Rosa from Mull? Rosa. Yes, Dugald; here thou seest A woeful bearer of unwelcome tidings. Dugald. What, hath thy lady sent thee? Rosa. Alas, alas! I have no lady now. Dugald. Ha! is she dead? not many days ago She was alive and well.âHast thou so soon The castle quittedâleft thy lady's corse? Rosa. Thinkst thou I would have left her?âOn the night When, as they say, she died, I from the castle By force was ta'en, and to mainland convey'd; Where in confinement I remain'd, till chance Gave me the means of breaking from my prison; And hither am I come, in woeful plight, The dismal tale to tell. Dugald. A tale, indeed, Most dismal, strange, and sudden. Rosa. How she died God knows; but much I fear foul play she had. Where is the Lord of Lorne? for first to him I wish to speak. Dugald. Come, I will lead thee to him.âHad foul play! Vassal. Fell fiends they are could shed her blood! If this Indeed hath been, 'twill make good cause, I wot; The warlike pipe will sound our summons soon. [Exeunt Dugald and Rosa, &amp;c., as Argyll and Sir Hubert enter by the opposite side. Arg. And wilt thou leave us then, my noble friend? May we not still for some few days retain thee? De Grey. Where'er I go, I carry in my heart A warm remembrance of the friendly home That still within these hospitable walls I've found; but longer urge me not to stay. In Helen's presence now, constrain'd and strange, With painful caution, chasing from my lips The ready thought, half-quiver'd into utterance, For cold corrected words, expressive only Of culprit consciousness,âI sit; nor e'en May look upon her face but as a thing On which I may not look; so painful now The mingled feeling is, since dark despair With one faint ray of hope hath temper'd been. I can no more endure it. She herself Perceives it, and it pains her.âLet me then Bid you farewell, my lord. When evening comes, I'll, under favour of the rising moon, Set forth. Arg. Indeed! so soon? and must it be? De Grey. Yes; to Northumberland without delay I fain would take my road. My aged father Looks now impatiently for my return. Arg. Then I'll no longer urge thee. To thy father, The noble baron, once, in better days, My camp-mate and my friend, I must resign thee. Bear to him every kind and cordial wish An ancient friend can send, andâ [A horn heard without. Hark! that horn! Some messenger of moment is arrived.â We'll speak of this again.âThe moon to-night Is near the full, and at an early hourâ Enter a Messenger, bearing a letter. Whose messenger art thou, who in thy hand That letter bearst with broad and sable seal, Which seems to bring to me some dismal tidings? Mess. From Mull, my lord, I come; and the Maclean, Our chief, commission'd me to give you this, Which is indeed with dismal tidings fraught. [Argyll opens the letter, and reads it with affected surprise and sorrow. Arg. Heavy, indeed, and sudden is the lossâ The sad calamity that hath befallen. The will of heaven be done! [Putting a handkerchief to his eyes, and leaning, as if for support, upon Sir Hubert; then, after a pause, turning to the messenger. How didst thou leave the chieftain? He, I hope, Permits not too much sorrow to o'er come His manhood. Doth he bear his grief composedly? Mess. O no, it is most violent! At the funeral, Had not the good Lochtarish, by his side, Supported him, he had with very grief Sunk to the earth.âAnd good Lochtarish too Was in right great affliction. Arg. Ay, good man; I doubt it not.âYe've had a splendid funeral? Mess. O yes, my lord! that have we had. Good truth! A grand and stately burial has it been. Three busy days and nights through all the isle Have bagpipes play'd, and sparkling beakers flow'd; And never corse, I trow, i' th' earth was laid With louder lamentations. Arg. Ay, I doubt not, Their grief was loud enough.âPray pass ye in. (To attendants at a distance.) Conduct him there; and see that he be treated, After his tedious journey, as befits A way-tired stranger. [Exeunt all but Argyll and Sir Hubert. This doth all hope and all belief exceed. Maclean will shortly follow this his notice, [Giving Sir Hubert the letter. To make me here a visit of condolence; And thus within our power they put themselves With most assured blindness. De Grey (after reading it). 'Tis Lochtarish, In all the arts of dark hypocrisy So deeply skill'd, who doth o'ershoot his mark, As such full often do. Arg. And let him come! At his own arts we trust to match him well.â Their force, I guess, is not in readiness; Therefore, meantime, to stifle all suspicion, This specious mummery he hath devised; And his most wretched chief, led by his will, Most wretchedly submits.âWell, let us go And tell to Lorne the news, lest too unguardedly He should receive it. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An apartment in the castle. Enter Sir Hubert de Grey, beckoning to Ross, who appears on the opposite side. De Grey. Rosa; I pray thee, spare me of thy leisure Some precious moments: something would I say: Wilt thou now favour me? Rosa. Most willingly. De Grey. As yet thy mistress knows not of the letter Sent by Maclean, announcing his design Of paying to the earl this sudden visitâ This mockery of condolence? Rosa. No; the earl Forbade me to inform her. De Grey. This is well; Her mind must be prepared. Meantime I go, And thou art here to comfort and attend her: O do it gently, Rosa! do it wisely! Rosa. You need not doubt my will.âGo ye so soon; And to Northumberland? De Grey. So I intended. And so Argyll and John of Lorne believe: But since this messenger from Mull arrived, Another thought has struck me.âSaidst thou not The childâthy lady's child, ta'en from the castle, Is to the keeping of Lochtarish' mother Committed, whose lone house is on the shore? Rosa. Yes, whilst in prison pent, so did I hear My keeper say, and much it troubled me. De Grey. Canst thou to some good islander commend me, Within whose house I might upon the watch Conceal'd remain?âIt is to Mull I go, And not to England. While Maclean is here, Attended by his vassals, the occasion I'll seize to save the infant. Rosa. Bless thee for it! Heaven bless thee for the thought!âI know a manâ An aged fisherman, who will receive you; Uncle to Morton: and if he himself Still in the island be, there will you find him, Most willing to assist you. De Grey. Hush, I pray I hear thy lady's steps. Rosa. Near to the castle gate, ere you depart, I'll be in waiting to inform you farther Of what may aid your purpose. De Grey. Do, good Rosa, And make me much thy debtor. But be secret. Rosa. You need not doubt me. Enter Helen, and De Grey goes up to her as if he would speak, but the words falter on his lips, and he is silent. Helen. Alas! I see it is thy parting visit; Thou com'st to say âfarewell!â De Grey. Yes, Helen: I am come to leave with thee A friend's dear benisonâa parting wishâ A lastârest ev'ry blessing on thy head! Be this permitted to me: [Kissing her hand with profound respect. Fare thee well! Heaven aid and comfort thee! Farewell! farewell! [Is about to retire hastily, whilst Helen follows to prevent him. Helen. O go not from me with that mournful look! Alas! thy gen'rous heart, depress'd and sunk, Looks on my state too sadly.â I am not, as thou thinkst, a thing so lost In woe and wretchedness.âBelieve not so! All whom misfortune with her rudest blasts Hath buffeted, to gloomy wretchedness Are not therefore abandon'd. Many souls From cloister'd cells, from hermits' caves, from holds Of lonely banishment, and from the dark And dreary prison-house, do raise their thoughts With humble cheerfulness to heaven, and feel A hallow'd quiet, almost akin to joy; And may not I, by heaven's kind mercy aided, Weak as I am, with some good courage bear What is appointed for me?âO be cheer'd! And let not sad and mournful thoughts of me Depress thee thus.âWhen thou art far away, Thou'lt hear, the while, that in my father's house I spend my peaceful days, and let it cheer thee. I too shall ev'ry southern stranger question, Whom chance may to these regions bring, and learn Thy fame and prosperous state. De Grey. My fame and prosperous state, while thou art thus! If thou in calm retirement liv'st contented, Lifting thy soul to heaven, what lack I more? My sword and spear, changed to a pilgrim's staff, Will be a prosperous state; and for my fame,â A feeble sound that after death remains, The echo of an unrepeated stroke That fades away to silence,âsurely this Thou dost not covet for me. Helen. Ah, I do! Yet, granting here I err, didst thou not promise To seek in wedded love and active duties Thy share of cheerful weal?âand dost thou now Shrink from thy gen'rous promise?âNo, thou shalt not. I hold thee boundâI claim it of thee boldly. It is my right. If thou, in sad seclusion, A lonely wanderer art, thou dost extinguish The ray that should have cheer'd my gloom: thou makest What else had been a calm and temper'd sorrow, A state of wretchedness.âO no! thou wilt not! Take to thy gen'rous heart some virtuous maid, And doubt not thou a kindred heart wilt find. The cheerful tenderness of woman's nature To thine is suited, and when join'd to thee, Will grow in virtue:âTake thou then this ring, If thou wilt honour so my humble gift, And put it on her hand; and be assured She who shall wear it,âshe whose happy fate Is link'd with thine, will prove a noble mate. De Grey. O there I am assured! she whose fate Is link'd with mine, if fix'd be such decree, Most rich in every soft and noble trait Of female virtue is: in this full well Assured I am.âI wouldâI thoughtâforgiveâ I speak but raving words:âa hasty spark, Blown and extinguish'd, makes me waver thus. Permit me then again. [Kissing her hand. High heaven protect thee! Farewell! Helen. Farewell! and heaven's good charge be thou! [They part, and both turn away to opposite sides of the stage, when Sir Hubert, looking round just as he is about to go off, and seeing Helen also looking after him sorrowfully, eagerly returns. De Grey. Ah! are those looksâ [Going to kneel at her feet, but immediately checking himself with much embarrassment. Alas! why come I back? Something there wasâthou gavest me a ring; I have not dropp'd it? Rosa (coming forward). No, 'tis on your finger. De Grey. Ay, true, good Rosa; but my wits are wilder'd; I knew not what I sought.â Farewell! farewell! [Exit De Grey hastily, while Helen and Rosa go off by the opposite side. ACT V. SCENE I. Argyll 's castle, the vestibule, or grand entrance; a noise of bustle and voices heard without, and servants seen crossing the stage, as the scene opens. Enter Dugald, meeting 1st servant. Dugald. They are arrived, Maclean and all his train; Run quickly, man, and give our chieftains notice. 1st serv. They know already: from the tower we spied The mournful cavalcade: the Earl and Lorne Are down the staircase hasting to receive them. Dugald. I've seen them light, a sooty-coated train, With lank and woeful faces, and their eyes Bent to the ground, as though our castle gate Had been the scutcheon'd portal of a tomb, Set open to receive them. 2d serv. Ay, on the pavement fall their heavy steps Measured and slow, as if her palled coffin They follow'd still. Dugald. Hush, man! Here comes the Earl, With face composed and stern; but look behind him How John of Lorne doth gnaw his nether lip, And beat his clenched hand against his thigh, Like one who tampers with half-bridled ire! 2d serv. Has any one offended him? Dugald. Be silent, For they will overhear thee.âYonder too [Pointing to the opposite side of the stage. Come the Macleans: let us our stations keep, And see them meet. [Retiring with the other to the bottom of the stage. Enter Argyll and Lorne, attended, and in deep mourning; while, at the same time, by the opposite side of the stage, enter Maclean, Benlora, Lochtarish, and Glenfadden, with attendants, also in deep mourning: Argyll and Maclean go up to one another, and formally embrace. Arg. Welcome! if such a cheerful word as this May with our deep affliction suited be. Lochtarish too, and brave Benlora, ay, And good Glenfadden also,âbe ye all With due respect received, as claims your worth. [Taking them severally by the hand as he names them. Maclean then advances to embrace Lorne, who shrinks back from him, but immediately correcting himself, bends his body another way, as if suddenly seized with some violent pain. Arg. (to Maclean). Regard him not: he hath imprudently A recent wound exposed to chiling air, And oft the pain with sudden pang attacks him. Loch. Ay, what is shrewder? we have felt the like, And know it well, my lord. Arg. (bowing to Lochtarish, but continuing to speak to Maclean). Yet, ne'ertheless, good son-in-law and chieftain, Believe thou well that with a brother's feelings, Proportion'd to the dire and dismal case That hath befallen, he now receives you; also Receiving these your friends with equal favour. This is indeed to us a woeful meeting, Chieftain of Mull. [Looking keenly in his face, while the other shuns his eye. I see full well the change Which violent grief upon that harrow'd visage So deeply hath impress'd. Mac. (still embarrassed, and shrinking from Argyll 's observation). Ah! ah! the woeful day!âI cannot speak. Alas, alas! Arg. Alas, in truth, Too much the woeful widower's alter'd looks, Upon thy face I see. Loch. (to Argyll). You see, my lord, his eyes with too much weeping Are weak, and shun the light. Nor should we marvel: What must to him the sudden loss have been, When even to us, who were more distantly Connected with her rare and matchless virtue, It brought such keen affliction? Arg. Yes, good Lochtarish, I did give her to youâ To your right worthy chief, a noble creature, With every kindly virtueâevery grace That might become a noble chieftain's wife: And that ye have so well esteem'dâso well Regarded, cherish'd, and respected her, As your excessive sorrow now declares, Receive from me a grateful father's thanks. Lochtarish, most of all to thy good love I am beholden. Loch. Ah! small was the merit Such goodness to respect. Arg. And thou, Benlora; A woman, and a stranger, on the brave Still potent claims maintain; and little doubt I They were by thee regarded. [Benlora steps back, frowning sternly, and remains silent. And, Glenfadden, Be not thy merits overlook'd. Glen. Alas! You overrate, my lord, such slender service. Arg. Wrong not, I pray, thy modest worth.âBut here, [Turning again to Maclean. Here most of all, from whom her gentle virtues, (And so indeed it right and fitting was,) Their best and dearest recompense received, To thee, most generous chieftain, let me pay The thanks that are thy due. Mac. Oh, oh! alas! Arg. Ay, in good sooth! I see thy grief-worn eyes Do shun the light. But grief is ever sparing of its words. In brief, I thank you all: and for the love Ye have so dearly shown to me and mine, I trust, before we part, to recompense you As suits your merit and my gratitude. Lorne (aside to Argyll). Ay, father; now ye speak to them shrewd words; And now I'm in the mood to back you well. Arg. (aside to Lorne). 'Tis well thou art; but check those eager looks; Lochtarish eyes thee keenly. [Directing a hasty glance to Lochtarish, who is whispering to Glenfadden, and looking suspiciously at Lorne. Lorne (stepping forward to Maclean, &amp;c.). Chieftain, and honour'd gentlemen, I pray The sullen, stern necessity excuse Which pain imposed upon me, and receive, Join'd with my noble father's, such poor thanks As I may offer to your loving worth. Arg. Pass on, I pray you; till the feast be ready, Rest ye above, where all things are prepared For your refreshment. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A narrow arched room or closet, adjoining to a gallery. Enter Lochtarish and Glenfadden. Loch. How likest thou this, Glenfadden? Doth the face Argyll assumes, of studied courtesy, Raise no suspicion? Glen. Faith, I know not well!â The speech, indeed, with which he welcomed us, Too wordy, and too artificial seem'd To be the native growth of what he felt. Loch. It so to me appear'd: and John of Lorne, First shrinking from Maclean, with sudden pain, As he pretended, struck; then stern and silent; Till presently assuming, like his father, A courtesy minute and over-studied, He glozed us with his thanks:â Didst thou not mark his keenly flashing eye, When spoke Argyll of recompensing us Before we part? Glen. I did indeed observe it. Loch. This hath a meaning. Glen. Faith, I do suspect Some rumour must have reach'd their ear; and yet Our agents faithful are; it cannot be. Loch. Or can, or can it not, beneath this roof A night I will not sleep. When evening comes Meet we again. If at this banquet, aught Shall happen to confirm our fears, forthwith Let us our safety seek in speedy flight. Glen. And leave Maclean behind us? Loch. Ay, and Benlora too. Affairs the better At Mull will thrive, when we have rid our hands Of both these hind'rances, who in our way Much longer may not be. [Listening. We're interrupted. Let us into the gallery return, And join the company with careless face, Like those who have from curiosity But stepp'd aside to view the house.âMake haste! It is Argyll and Lorne. [Exeunt, looking at the opposite side, alarmed, at which enter Argyll and Lorne. Lorne. Are you not now convinced? his conscious guilt Is in his downcast and embarrass'd looks, And careful shunning of all private converse Whene'er aside you've drawn him from his train, Too plainly seen: you cannot now, my lord, Doubt of his share in this atrocious deed. Arg. Yet, Lorne, I would, ere further we proceed, Prove it more fully still. The dinner hour Is now at hand. [Listening. What steps are those, That in the gallery, close to this door, Like some lone straggler from the company Withdrawn, sound quickly pacing to and fro? Look out and see. Lorne (going to the door, and calling back to Argyll in a low voice). It is Maclean himself. Arg. Beckon him hither then.âThank heaven for this! Now opportunity is fairly given, If that constrainedly he cloaks their guilt, To free him from their toils. Enter Maclean, conducted by Lorne. Arg. (to Maclean). My son, still in restraint before our vassals Have we conversed; but now in privacyâ Start not, I pray thee:âsit thee down, Maclean: I would have close and private words of thee: Sit down, I pray; my aged limbs are tired. [Argyll and Maclean sit down, whilst Lorne stands behind them, with his ear bent eagerly to listen, and his eyes fixed with a side-glance on Maclean. Chieftain, I need not say to thee, who deeply Lament'st with us our sad untimely loss, How keenly I have felt it.â And now indulge a father in his sorrow, And say how died my child.âWas her disease Painful as it was sudden? Mac. It wasâalas! I know not how it was. A fell disease!âHer end was so appointed. Lorne (behind). Ay, that I doubt not. Mac. A fearful malady! though it received All good assistance. Lorne (behind). That I doubt not either. Mac. A cruel ill!âbut how it dealt with her, My grief o'erwhelm'd me so, I could not tell. Arg. Sayâwast thou present? didst thou see her die? Mac. Oh, oh! the woeful sight, that I should see it! Arg. Thou didst not see it then? Mac. Alack! alack! O would that I had seenâO woe is me! Her painâher agony was short to mine! Lorne (behind, impatiently). Is this an answer, chieftain, to the question Argyll hath plainly ask'd theeâwast thou present When Helen died? didst thou behold her death? Mac. O yes; indeed I caught your meaning lamely; I meantâI thoughtâI know not certainly The very time and moment of her death, Although within my arms she breathed her last. Lorne (rushing forward eagerly). Now are we answered. [Argyll, covering his face with his hands, throws himself back in his chair for some time without speaking. Mac. (to Argyll). I fear, my lord, too much I have distress'd you. Arg. Somewhat you have indeed.âAnd further now I will not press your keen and recent sorrow With questions that so much renew its anguish. Mac. You did, belike, doubt of my tenderness. Arg. O no! I have no doubts. Within your arms She breathed her last? Mac. Within my arms she died. Arg. (looking hard at Maclean, and then turning away). His father was a brave and honest chief! Mac. What says my lord? Arg. A foolish exclamation, Of no determined meaning. [Bell sounds without. Dry our tears: The hall-bell warns us to the ready feast; And through the gallery I hear the sound Of many footsteps hastening to the call. Chieftain, I follow thee. [Exeunt Argyll and Maclean. Lorne (alone, stopping to listen). The castle, throng'd throughout with moving life, From every winding stair, and arched aisle, A mingled echo sends. Ay; light of foot, I hear their sounding steps A-trooping to the feast, who never more At feast shall sit, or social meal partake. O wretch! O fiend of vile hypocrisy! How fiercely burns my blood within my veins Till I am match'd with thee! [Exit. SCENE III. The great hall of the castle, with a feast set out, and the company already placed at table, with servants and attendants in waiting, who fill the stage in every part: Argyll is seated at the head of the table, with Maclean on his left hand, and a chair left empty on his right. Arg. (to Maclean, &amp;c.) Most worthy chief, and honour'd guests and kinsmen, I crave your pardon for this short delay: One of our company is wanting still, For whom we have reserved this empty place; Nor will the chief of Mull unkindly take it, That on our better hand this chair of honour Is for a lady kept. Omnes. A lady! [A general murmur of surprise is heard through the hall. Arg. Yes; Who henceforth of this house the mistress is; And were it palace of our Scottish king, Would so deserve to be. Omnes. We give you joy, my lord. [A confused murmur heard again. Mac. We give you joy, my lord: your age is bless'd. We little thought, in these our funeral weeds, A bridal feast to darken. Lorne. No, belike. Many who don their coat at break of day, Know not what shall befal them, therein girt, Ere evening close. [Assuming a gay tone. The Earl hath set a step-dame o'er my head To cow my prideâWhat think you, brave Maclean? This world so fleeting is and full of change, Some lose their wives, I trow, and others find them. Bridegrooms and widowers do, side by side, Their beakers quaff; and which of them at heart Most glad or sorry is, the subtle fiend, Who in men's hollow hearts his council holds, He wotteth best, though each good man will swear, His, lost or found, all other dames excell'd. Arg. Curb, Lorne, thy saucy tongue: Maclean himself Shall judge if sheâthe lady I have found, Equal in beauty her whom he hath lost. In worth I'm sure she does. But hush! she comes. [A great commotion through the hall amongst the attendants, &amp;c. Omnes. It is the lady. Arg. (rising from his seat, and making signs to the attendants nearest the door). Ho there! make room, and let the lady pass. [The servants, &amp;c. stand apart, ranging themselves on every side to let the lady pass; and enter Helen, magnificently dressed, with a deep white veil over her face; while Lorne, going forward to meet her, conducts her to her chair on Argyll 's right hand. Arg. (to the Campbells). Now, fill a cup of welcome to our friends! Loch. (to Maclean). Chieftain, forgettest thou to greet the lady? Mac. (turning to Argyll). Nay, rather give, my lord, might I presume, Our firstling cup to this fair lady's health, The noble dame of this right princely house. And though close veil'd she be, her beauty's lustre I little question. [Fills up a goblet, while Lochtarish, Benlora, &amp;c. follow his example, and standing up, bow to the lady. Your health, most noble dame! [Helen, rising also, bows to him, and throws back her veil: the cup falls from his hands; all the company start up from table; screams and exclamations of surprise are heard from all corners of the hall, and confused commotion seen every where. Maclean, Lochtarish, and Glenfadden, stand appalled and motionless; but Benlora, looking fiercely round him, draws his sword. Ben. What! are we here like deer bay'd in a nook? And think ye so to slay us, crafty foe? No, by my faith! like such we will not fall, Arms in our hands, though by a thousand foes Encompass'd. Cruel, murderous, ruthless men, Too good a warrant have you now to think us, But cowards never! Rouse ye, base Macleans! And thou, whose subtlety around us thus With wreckful skill these cursed toils hast wound, Sinks thy base spirit now? [To Lochtarish. Arg. (holding up his hand). Be silence in the hall! Macleans, ye are my guests; but if the feast Delight you not, free leave ye have to quit it. Lorne, see them all, with right due courtesy, Safely protected to the castle gate. [Turning to Maclean. Here, other name than chieftain or Maclean He may not give thee; but, without our walls, If he should call thee murderer, traitor, coward, Weapon to weapon, let your fierce contention Be fairly held, and he, who first shall yield, The liar be.â Campbells! I charge you there, Free passage for the chieftain and his train. [Maclean and Lochtarish, &amp;c., without speaking, quit the hall through the crowd of attendants, who divide, and form a line to let them pass. Helen, who had sunk down almost senseless upon her seat, seeing the hall cleared of the crowd, who go out after the Macleans, now starts up, and catches hold of Argyll with an imploring look of strong distress. Helen. O father! well I know foul are his crimes, But whatâO what, am I, that for my sake This bloody strife should be?âO think, my lord! He gave consent and sanction to my death, But thereon could not look: and at your gateâ E'en on your threshold, must his life be ta'en? For well I know the wrath of Lorne is deadly. And gallant Lorne himself, if scath should be,â O pity! pity!âO for pity stay them! Arg. Let go thy hold, weak woman: pity now! Rosa, support her hence. [Committing her to Rosa, who now comes forward, and tearing himself away. Helen (endeavouring to run after him, and catch hold of him again). O be not stern! beneath the ocean rather Would I had sunk to rest, than been the cause Of horrid strife like this! O pity! pity! [Exeunt, she running out after him distractedly. SCENE IV. Before the gate of the castle: a confused noise of an approaching crowd heard within, and presently enter, from the gate, Maclean, Benlora, Lochtarish, and Glenfadden, with their attendants, conducted by Lorne, and followed by a crowd of Campbells, who range themselves on both sides of the stage. Lorne (to Maclean). Now, chieftain, we the gate have pass'd,âthe bound That did restrain us. Host and guest no more, But deadly foes we stand, who from this spot Shall never both with life depart. Now, turn, And boldly say to him, if so thou darest, Who calls thee villain, murd'rer, traitor, coward, That he belies thee. Turn then, chief of Mull! Here, man to man, my single arm to thine, I give thee battle; or, refusing this, Our captive here retain thee to be tried Before the summon'd vassals of our clans, As suits thy rank and thine atrocious deeds. Take thou thy choice. Mac. Yes, John of Lorne, I turn. This turf on which we tread my death-bed is; This hour my latest term; this sky of light The last that I shall look on. Draw thy sword: The guilt of many crimes o'erwhelms my spirit But never will I shame my brave Macleans, By dying, as their chief, a coward's death. Ben. What! shalt thou fight alone, and we stand by Idly to look upon it? [Going up fiercely to Lorne. Turn me out The boldest, brawniest Campbell of your bands; Ay, more than one, as many as you will; And I the while, albeit these locks be grey, Leaning my aged back against this tree, Will show your youngsters how, in other days, Macleans did fight, when baited round with foes. Lorne. Be still, Benlora; other sword than these, Thy chief's and mine, shall not this day be drawn. If I prevail against him, here with us Our captives you remain. If I be conquer'd, Upon the faith and honour of a chieftain, Ye shall again to Mull in safety go. Ben. Spoken like a noble chieftain! Lorne. Ye shall, I say, to Mull in safety go. But there prepare ye to defend your coast Against a host of many thousand Campbells. In which, be well assured, swords as good As John of Lorne's, to better fortune join'd, Shall of your crimes a noble vengeance take. [Lorne and Maclean fight; and, after a combat of some length, Maclean is mortally wounded, and the Campbells give a loud shout. Mac. It is enough, brave Lorne; this wound is death: And better deed thou couldst not do upon me, Than rid me of a life disgraced and wretched. But guilty though I be, thou seest full well, That to the brave opposed, arms in hand, I am no coward.âOh! could I as bravely, In home-raised broils, with violent men have striv'n, It had been well: but there, alas! I proved A poor, irresolute, and nerveless wretch. [After a pause, and struggling for breath. To live, alas! in good men's memories Detested and contemn'd:âto be with her For whom I thought to beâCome, gloomy grave! Thou coverest all! [After another painful struggle, every one standing in deep silence round him, and Lorne bending over him compassionately. Pardon of man I ask not, And merit not.âBrave Lorne, I ask it not; Though in thy piteous eye a look I see That might embolden me.âThere is above One who doth know the weakness of our nature,â Our thoughts and conflicts:âall that e'er have breathed, The bann'd and bless'd must pass to Him:âmy soul Into His hands, in humble penitence, I do commit. [Dies. Lorne. And may Heaven pardon thee, unhappy man! Enter Argyll, and Helen following him, attended by Rosa. Lorne (to attendants). Alas, prevent her! [Endeavouring to keep her back. Helen, come not hither: This is no sight for thee. Helen (pressing forward, and seeing the body). Oh! oh! and hast thou dealt with him so quickly, Thou fell and ruthless Lorne?âNo time allow'd? [Kneeling by the body. O that within that form sense still were lodged! To hear my voice,âto know that in my heart No thought of theeâLet others scan thy deeds, Pitied and pardon'd art thou here. [Her hand on her breast. Alas! So quickly fell on thee th' avenging stroke, No sound of peace came to thy dying ear, No look of pity to thy closing eyes! Pitied and pardon'd art thou in this breast, But canst not know it now.âAlas! alas! Arg. (to attendants). Prepare ye speedily to move the body. Mean time, our prisoners within the castle Secure ye well. [To other attendants, who lay hold of Lochtarish and Glenfadden, while Benlora, drawing his sword, attacks furiously those who attempt to seize and disarm him, and they, closing round and endeavouring to overpower him, he is mortally wounded in the scuffle. Ben. Ay, bear me now within your prison walls; Alive indeed, thought ye to bind me? No. Two years within your dungeons have I lived, But lived for vengeance: closed that hope, the earth Close o'er me too!âAlive to bind Benlora! [Falls. Lorne (running up to him). Ha! have ye slain him?âFierce and warlike spirit! I'm glad that thou hast had a soldier's death, Arms in thy hands, all savage as thou art. [Turning to Lochtarish and Glenfadden. But thou, the artful, base, contriving villain, Who hast of an atrocious, devilish act The mover been, and this thy vile associate, Prepare ye for the villains' shameful end, Ye have so dearly earn'd. [Waving his hand for the attendants to lead them off. Loch. Be not so hasty, Lorne.âThinkst thou indeed Ye have us here within your grasp, and nought Of hostage or security retain'd For our protection? Lorne. What dost thou mean? Loch. Deal with us as ye will: But if within a week, return'd to Mull, In safety I appear not, with his blood, The helpless heir, thy sister's infant son, Who in my mother's house our pledge is kept, Must pay the forfeit. Helen (starting up from the body in an agony of alarm). O horrible! ye will not murder him? Murder a harmless infant! Loch. My aged mother, lady, loves her son As thou dost thine; and she has sworn to do it. Helen. Has sworn to do it! Oh! her ruthless nature Too well I know. (To Lorne eagerly.) Loose them, and let them go! Lorne. Let fiends like these escape? Arg. (to Helen). He does but threaten To move our fears: they dare not slay the child. Helen. They dare! they will!âO if thou art my father! If Nature's hand e'er twined me to thy heart As this poor child to mine, have pity on me! Loose them and let them go!âNay, do it quickly. O what is vengeance? Spare my infant's life! Unpitying Lorne!âart thou a brother too? The hapless father's blood is on thy sword, And wilt thou slay the child? O spare him! spare him! [Kneeling to Argyll and Lorne, who stand irresolute, when enter Sir Hubert De Grey, carrying something in his arms, wrapped up in a mantle, and followed by Morton. On seeing Sir Hubert, she springs from the ground, and rushes forward to him. Ha! art thou here? in blessed hour return'd To join thy prayers with mine,âto move their heartsâ Their flinty hearts;âto bid them spare my child! De Grey (lifting up the mantle, and showing a sleeping child). The prayer is heard already: look thou here Beneath this mantle where he soundly sleeps. [Helen utters a cry of joy, and holds out her arms for the child, but at the same time sinks to the ground, embracing the knees of Sir Hubert. Argyll and Lorne run up to him, and all their vassals, &amp;c., crowding round close them about on every side, while a general murmur of exultation is heard through the whole. Lochtarish and Glenfadden, remaining on the side of the stage with those who guard them, are struck with astonishment and consternation. Arg. (to those who guard Lochtarish, &amp;c. stepping forward from the crowd). Lead to the grated keep your prisoners, There to abide their doom. Upon the guilty Our vengeance falls, and only on the guilty. To all their clan beside, in which I know Full many a gallant heart included is, I still extend a hand of amity. If they reject it, fair and open war Between us be: and trust we still to find them The noble, brave Macleans, the valiant foes, That, ere the dark ambition of a villain, For wicked ends, their gallant minds had warp'd, We heretofore had found them. O that men In blood so near, in country, and in valour, Should spend in petty broils their manly strength, That might, united for the public weal, On foreign foes such noble service do! O that the day were come when gazing southron, Whilst these our mountain warriors, marshall'd forth To meet in foreign climes their country's foes, Along their crowded cities slowly march, To sound of warlike pipe, their plaided bands, Shall say, with eager fingers pointing thus, âBehold those men!âtheir sunn'd but thoughtful brows: Their sinewy limbs; their broad and portly chests, Lapp'd in their native vestments, rude but graceful!â Those be our hardy brothers of the north;â The bold and gen'rous race, who have, beneath The frozen circle and the burning line, The rights and freedom of our native land Undauntedly maintain'd.â That day will come, When in the grave this hoary head of mine, And many after heads, in death are laid; And happier men, our sons, shall live to see it. O may they prize it too with grateful hearts; And, looking back on these our stormy days Of other years, pity, admire, and pardon The fierce, contentious, ill-directed valour Of gallant fathers, born in darker times! [The curtain drops. THE MARTYR: A DRAMA, IN THREE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA MEN Nero, emperor of Rome. Cordenius Maro, officer of the imperial guard. Orceres, a Parthian prince, visiting Rome. Sulpicius, a senator. Sylvius, a brave centurion. Roman Pontiff. Christian father or bishop, Christian brother, &amp;c. A page, in the family of Sulpicius. Senators, Christians, soldiers, &amp;c.WOMEN Portia, daughter of Sulpicius. Christian women. Scene, Rome. ACT I. SCENE I. A private apartment in the house of Sulpicius. Enter Sulpicius and Orceres by opposite sides. Sul. So soon return'd!âI read not in thy face Aught to encourage or depress my wishes. How is it, noble friend? Or. E'en as it was ere I received my mission. Cordenius Maro is on public duty; I have not seen him.âWhen he knows your offer, His heart will bound with joy, like eaglet plumed, Whose outstretch'd pinions, wheeling round and round, Shape their first circles in the sunny air. Sul. And with good cause. Or. Methinks I see him now! A face with blushes mantling to the brow, Eyes with bright tears surcharged, and parted lips Quiv'ring to utter joy which hath no words. Sul. His face, indeed, as I have heard thee say, Is like a wave which sun and shadow cross; Each thought makes there its momentary mark. Or. And then his towering form, and vaulting step, As tenderness gives way to exultation! O! it had been a feast to look upon him; And still shall be. Sul. Art thou so well convinced He loves my little damsel?âShe is fair, But seems to me too simple, gay, and thoughtless, For noble Maro. Heiress as she is To all my wealth, had I suspected sooner, That he had smother'd wishes in his breast As too presumptuous, or that she in secret Preferr'd his silent homage to the praise Of any other man, I had most frankly Removed all hindrance to so fair a suit. For, in these changeling and degenerate days, I scarcely know a man of nobler worth. Or. Thou scarcely knowst! Say certainly thou dost not. He is, to honest right, as simply true As shepherd child on desert pasture bred, Where falsehood and deceit have never been; And to maintain them, ardent, skilful, potent, As the shrewd leader of unruly tribes. A simple heart and subtle spirit join'd Make such an union, as in Nero's court May pass for curious and unnatural. Sul. But is the public duty very urgent That so untowardly delays our happiness? Or. The punishment of those poor Nazarenes, Who, in defiance of imperial power, To their forbidden faith and rights adhere With obstinacy most astonishing. Sul. A stubborn contumacy, unaccountable! Or. There's sorcery in it, or some stronger power. But be it what it may, or good, or ill, They look on death in its most dreadful form, As martial heroes on a wreath of triumph. The fires are kindled in the place of death, And bells toll dismally. The life of Rome In one vast clust'ring mass hangs round the spot, And no one to his neighbour utters word, But in an alter'd voice, with breath restrain'd, Like those who speak at midnight near the dead. Cordenius heads the band that guards the pile; So station'd, who could speak to him of pleasure? My words had come like sounds of evil omen. Sul. Cease; here comes Portia, with a careless face: She knows not yet the happiness that waits her. Or. Who brings she with her thus, as if compell'd By playful force? Sul. 'Tis her Numidian page; a cunning imp, Who must be woo'd to do the thing he's proud of. Enter Portia, dragging Syphax after her, speaking as she enters. Portia. Come in, deceitful thing!âI know thee well; With all thy sly affected bashfulness, Thou'rt bold enough to sing in CÃ¦sar's court, With the whole senate present. (To Orceres.) Prince of Parthia, I knew not you were here; but yet I guess The song which this sly creature sings so well, Will please you also. Or. How can it fail, fair Portia, so commended? Sul. What is this boasted lay? Portia. That tune, my father, Which you so oft have tried to recollect; But link'd with other words, of new device, That please my fancy well.âCome, sing it, boy! Sul. Nay, sing it, Syphax, be not so abash'd, If thou art really so.âBegin, begin! But speak thy words distinctly as thou singst, That I may have their meaning perfectly. SONG. The storm is gath'ring far and wide, Yon mortal hero must abide. Power on earth, and power in air, Falchion's gleam and lightning's glare: Arrows hurtling through the blast; Stones from flaming meteor cast; Floods from burthen'd skies are pouring, Mingled strife of battle roaring; Nature's rage and Demon's ire, Belt him round with turmoil dire: Noble hero, earthly wight, Brace thee bravely for the fight! And so, indeed, thou tak'st thy stand, Shield on arm and glaive in hand; Breast encased in burnish'd steel, Helm on head, and pike on heel; And, more than meets the outward eye, The soul's high-temper'd panoply, Which every limb for action lightens, The form dilates, the visage brightens: Thus art thou, lofty, mortal wight, Full nobly harness'd for the fight! Or. The picture of some very noble hero These lines pourtray. Sul. So it should seem; one of the days of old. Portia. And why of olden days? There liveth now The very manâa manâI mean to say, There may be found among our Roman youth, One, who in form and feelings may compare With him, whose lofty virtues these few lines So well describe. Or. Thou meanst the lofty Gorbus. Portia. Out on the noisy braggart. Arms without He hath, indeed, well burnish'd and well plumed, But the poor soul, within, is pluck'd and bare, Like any homely thing. Or. Sertorius Galba then? Portia. O, stranger still! For if he hath no lack of courage, certes, He hath much lack of grace. Sertorius Galba! Or. Perhaps thou meanst Cordenius Maro, lady. Thy cheeks grow scarlet at the very name, Indignant that I still should err so strangely. Portia. No, not indignant, for thou errest not; Nor do I blush, albeit thou thinkst I do, To say, there is not of our Romans one, Whose martial form a truer image gives Of firm heroic courage. Sul. Cease, sweet Portia! He only laughs at thy simplicity. Or. Simplicity seen through a harmless wile, Like to the infant urchin, half conceal'd Behind his smiling dam's transparent veil. The song is not a stranger to mine ear, Methinks I've heard it passing through those wilds, Whose groves and caves, if rumour speak the truth, Are by the Nazarenes or Christians haunted. Sul. Let it no more be sung within my walls: A chaunt of their's to bring on pestilence! Sing it no more. What sounds are those I hear? Or. The dismal death-drum and the crowd without. They are this instant leading past your door Those wretched Christians to their dreadful doom. Sul. We'll go and see them pass. [Exeunt hastily, Sulpicius, Orceres. Portia (stopping her ears). I cannot look on them, nor hear the sound. I'll to my chamber. Page. May not I, I pray, Look on them as they pass? Portia. No; go not, child: 'Twill frighten thee; it is a horrid sight. Page. Yet, an it please you, lady, let me go. Portia. I say it is a horrid, piteous sight, Thou wilt be frighten'd at it. Page. Nay, be it e'er so piteous or so horrid, I have a longing, strong desire to see it. Portia. Go then; in this there is no affectation: There's all the harden'd cruelty of man Lodged in that tiny form, child as thou art. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. An open square, with buildings. Enter Cordenius Maro, at the head of his soldiers, who draw up on either side; then enters a long procession of public functionaries, &amp;c., conducting martyrs to the place of execution, who, as they pass on, sing together in unison: one, more noble than the others, walking first. SONG. A long farewell to sin and sorrow, To beam of day and evening shade; High in glory breaks our morrow, With light that cannot fade. We leave the hated and the hating, Existence sad in toil and strife; The great, the good, the brave are waiting To hail our opening life. Earth's faded sounds our ears forsaking, A moment's silence death shall be; Then to heaven's jubilee awaking, Faith ends in victory. [Exeunt martyrs, &amp;c. &amp;c. Cordenius with his officers and soldiers still remaining; the officers on the front, and Cordenius apart from them in a thoughtful posture. 1st offi. Brave Varus marches boldly at the head Of that deluded band. 2d offi. Are these the men who hateful orgies hold, In dens and deserts with enchantments wooing The intercourse of demons? 3d offi. Ay, with rites Cruel and wild. To crucify a babe, And, while it yet hangs shrieking on the rood, Fall down and worship it! device abominable! 1st offi. Dost thou believe it? 3d offi. I can believe or this or any thing Of the possess'd and mad. 1st offi. What demonry, thinkst thou, possesses Varus? 2d offi. That is well urged. (To the other.) Is he a maniac? Alas, that I should see so brave a soldier Thus, as a malefactor, led to death! 1st offi. Viewing his keen enliven'd countenance And stately step, one should have rather guess'd He led victorious soldiers to the charge: And they, indeed, appear'd to follow him With noble confidence. 3d offi. 'Tis all vain seeming. He is a man, who makes a show of valour To which his deeds have borne slight testimony. Cor. (advancing indignantly). Thou liest; a better and a braver soldier Ne'er fronted foe, nor closed in bloody strife. [Turning away angrily to the background. 1st offi. Our chief, methinks, is in a fretful mood, Which is not usual with him. 2d offi. He did not seem to listen to our words, Yet they have moved him keenly.â But see, he gives the signal to proceed; We must advance, and with our closing ranks The fatal pile encircle. [Exeunt in order, whilst a chorus of martyrs is heard at a distance. SCENE III. An apartment in a private house. Enter two Christian Women by opposite sides. 1st woman. Hast thou heard any thing? 2d woman. Nought, save the murmur of the multitude, Sinking at times to deep and awful silence, From which again a sudden burst will rise Like mingled exclamations, as of horror Or admiration. In these neighbouring streets I have not met a single citizen, The town appearing uninhabited. But wherefore art thou here? Thou shouldst have stay'd With the unhappy mother of poor CÃ¦lus. 1st woman. She sent me hither in her agony Of fear and fearful hope. 2d woman. Ha! does she hope deliverance from death? 1st woman. O no! thou wrongst her, friend; it is not that: Deliverance is her fear, and death her hope. A second time she bears a mother's throes For her young stripling, whose exalted birth To endless life is at this fearful crisis, Or earn'd or lost. May heaven forefend the last! He is a timid youth, and soft of nature: God grant him strength to bear that fearful proof! 2d woman. Here comes our reverend father. Enter a Christian Father. What tidings dost thou bring? are they in bliss? Father. Yes, daughter, as I trust, they are ere this In high immortal bliss. CÃ¦lus aloneâ 1st woman. He hath apostatised! O woe is me! O woe is me for his most wretched mother! Father Apostatised! No; stripling as he is, His fortitude, where all were braced and brave, Shone paramount. For his soft downy cheek and slender form Made them conceive they might subdue his firmness: Therefore he was reserved till noble Varus And his compeers had in the flames expired Then did they court and tempt him with fair promise Of all that earthly pleasure or ambition Can offer, to deny his holy faith. But he, who seem'd before so meek and timid, Now suddenly imbued with holy grace, Like the transition of some watery cloud In passing o'er the moon's refulgent disc, Glow'd with new life; and from his fervid tongue Words of most firm indignant constancy Pour'd eloquently forth; then to the pile Sprang he as lightly as a dauntless warrior Scaling the breach of honour; or, alas! As I have seen him 'midst his boyish mates, Vaulting aloft for very love of motion. 1st woman. High heaven be praised for this!â thine eyes beheld it? Father. I saw it not: the friend who witness'd it, Left him yet living 'midst devouring flame; Therefore I spoke of CÃ¦lus doubtfully, If he as yet belong'd to earth or heaven. [They cover their faces, and remain silent. Enter a Christian Brother. Brother. Lift up your heads, my sisters! let your voices In grateful thanks be raised! Those ye lament, Have earthly pangs for heavenly joy exchanged. The manly Varus, and the youthful CÃ¦lus, The lion and the dove, yoke-fellows link'd, Have equal bliss and equal honour gain'd. st woman. And praised be God, who makes the weakest strong! I'll to his mother with the blessed tidings. [Exit. Father. Let us retire and pray. How soon our lives May have like ending, God alone doth know! O! may like grace support us in our need! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An open space in front of a temple. Enter Cordelius, as returned from the execution with his soldiers, who, upon a signal from him, disperse and leave him alone. He walks a few paces slowly, then stops, and continues for a short time in a thoughtful posture. Cor. There is some power in this, or good or ill, Surpassing nature. When the soul is roused To desp'rate sacrifice, 'tis ardent passion, Or high exalted virtue that excites it. Can loathsome demonry in dauntless bearing Outdo the motives of the lofty brave? It cannot be! There is some power in this Mocking all thoughtâincomprehensible. [Remains for a moment silent and thoughtful, while Sylvius enters behind him unperceived. Delusion! ay, 'tis said the cheated sight Will see unreal things; the cheated ear List to sweet sounds that are not; even the reason Maintain conclusions wild and inconsistent. We hear of this:âthe weak may be deluded; But is the learn'd, th' enlighten'd noble Varus The victim of delusion?âCan it be? I'll not believe it. Sylvius (advancing to him). No, believe it not. Cor. (starting). Ha! one so near me! I have seen thy face before; but where? who art thou? Sylvius. E'en that Centurion of the Seventh Legion, Who, with Cordenius Maro, at the siege Of Fort Volundum, A strong fort in Armenia, taken by Corbullo in Nero's reign. mounted first the breach; And kept the clust'ring enemy in check, Till our encouraged Romans followed us. Cor. My old companion then, the valiant Sylvius, Thou'st done hard service since I saw thee last: Thy countenance is mark'd with graver lines Than in those greener days: I knew thee not. Where goest thou now? I'll bear thee company. Sylvius. I thank thee: yet thou mayst not go with me. The way that I am wending suits not thee, Though suiting well the noble and the brave. It were not well, in fiery times like these, To tempt thy generous mind. Cor. What dost thou mean? Sylvius (after looking cautiously round to see that nobody is near). Did I not hear thee commune with thyself Of that most blessed Martyr gone to rest, Varus Dobella? Cor. How blessed? My unsettled thoughts were busy With things mysterious; with those magic powers That work the mind to darkness and destruction; With the sad end of the deluded Varus. Sylvius. Not so, not so! The wisest prince on earth, With treasured wealth and armies at command, Ne'er earn'd withal such lofty exaltation As Varus now enjoys. Cor. Thy words amaze me, friend; what is their meaning? Sylvius. They cannot be explain'd with hasty speech In such a place. If thou wouldst really knowâ And may such lightâ Cor. Why dost thou check thy words, And look so much disturb'd, like one in doubt? Sylvius. What am I doing? Zeal, perhaps, betrays me. Yet, wherefore hide salvation from a man Who is so worthy of it? Cor. Why art thou agitated thus? What moves thee? Sylvius. And wouldst thou really know it? Cor. Dost thou doubt me? I have an earnest, most intense desire. Sylvius. Sent to thy heart, brave Roman, by a Power Which I may not resist. [Bowing his head. But go not with me now in open day. At fall of eve I'll meet thee in the suburb, Close to the pleasure-garden of Sulpicius; Where in a bushy crevice of the rock There is an entry to the catacombs, Known but to few. Cor. Ha! to the catacombs! Syl. A dismal place, I own, but heed not that; For there thou'lt learn what, to thy ardent mind, Will make this world but as a thorny pass To regions of delight; man's natural life, With all its varied turmoil of ambition, But as the training of a wayward child To manly excellence; yea, death itself But as a painful birth to life uncnding. The word eternal has not to thine ears, As yet, its awful, ample sense convey'd. Cor. Something possesses thee. Sylvius. Yes, noble Maro; But it is something which can ne'er possess A mind that is not virtuous.âLet us part; It is expedient now.âAll good be with thee! Cor. And good be with thee, also, valiant soldier! Sylvius (returning as he is about to go out). At close of day, and near the pleasure-garden,â The garden of Sulpicius. Cor. I know the spot, and will not fail to meet thee. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. The Catacombs, showing long low-roofed aisles, in different directions, supported by thick pillars of the rough unhewn rock, with rude tombs and heaps of human bones, and the walls in many places lined with human skulls. Enter Cordenius Maro, speaking to a Christian Father, on whose arm he leans, and followed by Sylvius. Cor. One day and two bless'd nights, spent in acquiring Your heavenly lore, so powerful and sublime.â Oh! what an alter'd creature they have made me! Father. Yes, gentle son, I trust that thou art alter'd. Cor. I am, methinks, like one who, with bent back And downward gazeâif such an one might beâ Hath only known the boundless azure sky By the strait circle of reflected beauty, Seen in the watery gleam of some deep pit: Till on a sudden roused, he stands erect, And wondering looks aloft and all around On the bright sunny firmament:âlike one (Granting again that such an one might be) Who hath but seen the element of fire On household hearth or woodman's smoky pile, And looks at once, 'mid 'stounding thunder-peals, On Jove's magnificence of lightning.âPardon, I pray you pardon me! I mean His lightning, Who is the Jove of Jove, the great Jehovah. Father (smiling). Be not disturb'd, my son; the lips will utter, From lengthen'd habit, what the mind rejects. Cor. These blessed hours, which I have pass'd with you, Have to my intellectual being given New feelings and expansion, like to that Which once I felt, on viewing by degrees The wide developement of nature's amplitude. Father. And how was that, my son? Cor. I well remember it; even at this moment Imagination sees it all again. 'Twas on a lofty mountain of Armenia, O'er which I led by night my martial cohort, To shun the fierce heat of a summer's day. Close round us hung, the vapours of the night Had form'd a woofy curtain, dim and pale, Through which the waning moon did faintly mark Its slender crescent. Father. Ay, the waned moon through midnight vapours seen, Fit emblem is of that retrenching light, Dubious and dim, which to the earliest patriarchs Was at the first vouchsafed; a moral guide, Soon clouded and obscured to their descendants, Who peopled far and wide, in scatter'd tribes, The fertile earth.âBut this is interruption. Proceed, my son. Cor. Well, on the lofty summit We halted, and the day's returning light On this exalted station found us. Then Our brighten'd curtain, wearing into shreds And rifted masses, through its opening gave Glimpse after glimpse of slow revealed beauty, Which held th' arrested senses magic-bound, In the intensity of charm'd attention. Father. From such an eminence the op'ning mist Would to the eye reveal most beauteous visions. Cor. First, far beneath us, woody peaks appear'd And knolls with cedars crested; then, beyond, And lower still, the herdsmen's cluster'd dwellings, With pasture slopes, and flocks just visible; Then, further still, soft wavy wastes of forest, In all the varied tints of sylvan verdure, Descending to the plain; then, wide and boundless, The plain itself, with towns and cultured tracts, And its fair river gleaming in the light, With all its sweepy windings, seen and lost, And seen again, till through the pale grey tint Of distant space, it seem'd a loosen'd cestus From virgin's tunic blown; and still beyond, The earth's extended vastness from the sight Wore like the boundless ocean. My heart beat rapidly at the fair sightâ This ample earth, man's natural habitation. But now, when to my mental eye reveal'd, His moral destiny, so grand and noble, Lies stretching on even to immensity, It overwhelms me with a flood of thoughts, Of happy thoughts. Father. Thanks be to God that thou dost feel it so! Cor. I am most thankful for the words of power Which from thy gifted lips and sacred scripture I have received. What feelings they have raised! O what a range of thought given to the mind! And to the soul what loftiness of hope! That future dreamy state of faint existence Which poets have described and sages taught, In which the brave and virtuous pined and droop'd In useless indolence, changed for a state Of social love, and joy, and active bliss,â A state of brotherhood,âa state of virtue, So grand, so purified;âO it is excellent! My soul is roused within me at the sound, Like some poor slave, who from a dungeon issues To range with free-born men his native land. Father. Thou mayst, indeed, my son, redeem'd from thraldom, Become the high compeer of blessed spirits. Cor. The high compeer of such!âThese gushing tears, Nature's mysterious tears, will have their way. Father. To give thy heart relief. Cor. And yet mysterious. Why do we weep At contemplation of exalted virtue? Perhaps in token of the fallen state In which we are, as thrilling sympathy Strangely acknowledges some sight and sound, Connected with a dear and distant home, Albeit the memory that link hath lost:â A kind of latent sense of what we were, Or might have been; a deep mysterious token. Father. Perhaps thou'rt right, my son; for e'en the wicked Will sometimes weep at lofty, generous deeds. Some broken traces of our noble nature Were yet preserved; therefore our great Creator Still loved His work, and thought it worth redemption: Therefore His generous Son, our blessed Master, Did, as the elder brother of that race, Whose form He took, lay down His life to save us, But I have read thee, from our sacred book, His gentle words of love. Cor. Thou hast! thou hast! they're stirring in my heart: Each fibre of my body thrills in answer To the high call.â Father. The Spirit of Power, my son, is dealing with thee. Cor. (after a pause). One thing amazes me,â yet it is excellent. Father. And what amazes thee? Unbosom freely What passes in thy mind. Cor. That this religion which dilates our thoughts Of God Supreme to an infinity Of awful greatness, yet connects us with him, As children, loved and cherish'd;â Adoring awe with tenderness united. Sylvius (eagerly). Ay, brave Cordenius, that same thought more moved My rude unletter'd mind than all the rest. I struck my hand against my soldier's mail, And cried, âThis faith is worthy of a man!â Cor. Our best philosophers have raised their thoughts To one great universal Lord of all, Lord even of Jove himself and all the gods; Yet who durst feel for that high, distant Essence, A warmer sentiment than deep submission? But now, adoring love and grateful confidence Cling to th' infinity of power and goodness, As the repentant child turns to his sire With yearning looks, that say, âAm I not thine?â I am too bold: I should be humbled first In penitence and sorrow, for the stains Of many a hateful vice and secret passion. Father. Check not the generous tenor of thy thoughts: O check it not! Love leads to penitence, And is the noblest, surest path; while fear Is dark and devious. To thy home return, And let thy mind well weigh what thou hast heard. If then thou feel within thee faith assured; That faith, which may, e'en through devouring flames, Its passage hold to heaven, baptismal rites Shall give thee entrance to a purer life, Receive thee, as thy Saviour's valiant soldier, For His high warfare arm'd. Cor. I am resolved, and feel that in my heart There lives that faith; baptize me ere we part. Father. So be it then. But yet that holy rite Must be deferr'd; for, lo! our brethren come, Bearing the ashes of our honour'd saints, Which must, with hymns of honour, be received. Enter Christians, seen advancing slowly along one of the aisles, and bearing a large veiled urn, which they set down near the front. They then lift off the veil and range themselves round it, while one sings and the rest join in the chorus at the end of each short verse. SONG. Departed brothers, generous brave, Who for the faith have died, Nor its pure source denied, Your bodies from devouring flames to save, CHORUS. Honour on earth, and bliss in heaven, Be to your saintly valour given! And we, who, left behind, pursue A pilgrim's weary way To realms of glorious day, Shall rouse our fainting souls with thoughts of you. Honour on earth, &amp;c. Your ashes, mingled with the dust, Shall yet be forms more fair Than e'er breathed vital air, When earth again gives up her precious trust. Honour on earth, &amp;c. The trump of angels shall proclaim, With tones far sent and sweet, Which countless hosts repeat, The generous martyr's never-fading name. Honour on earth, and bliss in heaven, Be to your saintly valour given! Cor. (to father). And ye believe those, who a few hours since Were clothed in flesh and blood, and here, before us, Lie thus, e'en to a few dry ashes changed, Are now exalted spirits, holding life With blessed powers, and agencies, and all Who have on earth a virtuous part fulfill'd? The dear redeem'd of Godlike love, again To their primeval destiny restored? It is a generous, powerful, noble faith. Sylvius. Did I not tell thee, as we pass'd along, It well became a Roman and a soldier? Father. Nay, worthy Sylvius, somewhat more of meekness And less of martial ardour were becoming In those, whose humble Lord stretch'd forth His hand, His saving hand, to e'en the meanest slave Who bends beneath an earthly master's rod. This faith is meet for all of human kind. Cor. Forgive him, father: see, he stands reproved; His heart is meek, though ardent; It is, indeed, a faith for all mankind. Father. We feel it such, my son, press'd as we are; On every side beset with threatening terrors. Look on these ghastly walls, these shapeless pillars, These heaps of human bones,âthis court of death; E'en here, as in a temple, we adore The Lord of Life, and sing our song of hope, That death has lost its sting, the grave its triumph. Cor. O make me then the partner of your hopes! [Taking the hand of Sylvius, and then of several other Christians. Brave men! high destined souls! immortal beings! The blessed faith and sense of what we are Comes on my heart, like streams of beamy light Pour'd from some opening cloud. O to conceive What lies beyond the dim, dividing veil Of regions bright, of blest and glorious being! Father. Ay, when it is withdrawn, we shall behold What heart hath ne'er conceived, nor tongue could utter. Cor. When but a boy, I've gazed upon the sky, With all its sparks of light, as a grand cope For the benighted world. But now my fancy Will greet each twinkling star, as the bright lamp Of some fair angel on his guardian watch. And think ye not, that from their lofty stations Our future glorious home, our Father's house, May lie within the vast and boundless ken Of such seraphic powers? Father. Thy fancy soars on wide and buoyant wings; Speak on, my son, I would not check thy ardour. Cor. This solid earth is press'd bencath our feet, But as a step from which to take our flight; What boots it then, if rough or smooth it be, Serving its end?âCome, noble Sylvius! We've been companions in the broil of battle, Now be we fellow-soldiers in that warfare Which best becomes the brave. Sylvius. Cordenius Maro, we shall be companions When this wide earth with all its fields of blood Where war hath raged, and all its towers of strength Which have begirded been with iron hosts, Are shrunk to nothing, and the flaming sun Is in his course extinguish'd. Cor. Come, lead me, father, to the holy fount, If I in humble penitence may be From worldly vileness clear'd. Father. I gladly will, my son. The Spirit of Grace Is dealing with thy spirit: be received, A ransom'd penitent, to the high fellowship Of all the good and bless'd in earth and heaven! Enter a Convert. Whence com'st thou, Fearon? Why wast thou prevented From joining in our last respectful homage To those, who have so nobly for the truth Laid down their lives? Convert. I have been watching near the grated dungeon Where Ethocles, the Grecian, is immured. Father. Thou sayst not so! A heavier loss than this, If they have seized on him, the righteous cause Could not have suffer'd. Art thou sure of it? We had not heard of his return from Syria. Convert. It is too true: he landed ten days since On the Brundusian coast, and, as he enter'd The gates of Rome, was seized and dragg'd to prison. Father. And we in utter ignorance of this! Convert. He travell'd late and unaccompanied, So this was done at nightfall and conceal'd. But see his writing given me by a guard, Who has for pity's sake betray'd his trust: It is address'd to thee. [Giving him a paper. Father (after reading it). Alas, alas! it is a brief account Of his successful labours in the East: For with his excellent gifts of eloquence, Learning, and prudence, he has made more converts Than all our zealous brotherhood beside. What can we do? He will be sacrificed: The church in him must bleed, if God so wills. It is a dreadful blow. Cor. (to the convert). I pray thee, in what prison is he kept? Convert. In Sylla's tower, that dwelling of despair. Cor. Guarded by Romans? Convert. Yes; and strongly guarded. Cor. Yet, he shall be released. Father (to Cordenius). Beware, my son, of rash, imprudent zeal: The truth hath suffer'd much from this; beware: Risk not thyself: thy life is also precious. Cor. My whole of life is precious: but this shred, This earthly portion of it, what is that, But as it is employ'd in holy acts? Am I Christ's soldier at a poorer rate Than I have served an earthly master? No; I feel within my glowing breast a power Which says I am commission'd for this service. Give me thy blessingâthy baptismal blessing, And then God's spirit guide me! Serving God, I will not count the cost but to discharge it. Father. His will direct thee then, my gen'rous son! His blessing be upon thee!âLead him, Sylvius, To the blest fount, where from his former sins He shall by heavenly grace be purified. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The garden of Sulpicius. Enter Sulpicius and Portia, with flowers in her hand. Portia. Was it not well to rise with early morn And pay my homage to sweet Flora? Never Were flowers by mid-day cull'd, so fair, so fragrant, With blending streaky tints, so fresh and bright. See: twinkling dew-drops lurk in every bell, And on the fibred leaves stray far apart, Like little rounded gems of silver sheen, While curling tendrils grasp with vigorous hold The stem that bears them! All looks young and fresh. The very spider through his circled cage Of wiry woof, amongst the buds suspended, Scarce seems a loathly thing, but like the small Imprison'd bird of some capricious nymph. Is it not so, my father? Sul. Yes, morn and youth and freshness sweetly join, And are the emblems of dear changeful days. By night those beauteous thingsâ Portia. And what of night? Why do you check your words? You are not sad? Sul. No, Portia; only angry with myself For crossing thy gay stream of youthful thoughts With those of sullen age. Away with them! What if those bright-leaved flowers, so soft and silken, Are gather'd into dank and wrinkled folds When evening chills them, or upon the earth, With broken stems and buds torn and dispersed, Lie prostrate, of fair form and fragrance reft When midnight winds pass o'er them; be it so! All things but have their term. In truth, my child, I'm glad that I indulged thee By coming forth at such an early hour To pay thy worship to so sweet a goddess, Upon her yearly feast. Portia. I thank you, father! On her feast, 'tis said, That she, from mortal eye conceal'd, vouchsafes Her presence in such sweet and flowery spots: And where due offerings on her shrine are laid, Blesses all seeds and shoots, and things of promise. Sul. How many places in one little day She needs must visit then! Portia. But she moves swift as thought. The hasty zephyr, That stirr'd each slender leaf, now as we enter'd, And made a sudden sound, by stillness follow'd, Might be the rapid rustling of her robe. Sul. A pleasing fancy, Portia, for the moment, Yet wild as pleasing. Portia. Wherefore call it wild? Full many a time I've listen'd when alone In such fair spots as this, and thought I heard Sweet mingled voices uttering varied tones Of question and reply, pass on the wind, And heard soft steps upon the ground; and then The notion of bright Venus or Diana, Or goddess-nymphs, would come so vividly Into my mind, that I am almost certain Their radiant forms were near me, though conceal'd By subtle drapery of the ambient air. And oh, how I have long'd to look upon them! An ardent strange desire, though mix'd with fear. Nay, do not smile, my father: such fair sights Were seen â were often seen in ancient days: The poets tell us so. But look, the Indian roses I have foster'd Are in full bloom; and I must gather them. [Exit eagerly. Sul. (alone). Go, gentle creature, thou art careless yet. Ah! couldst thou so remain, and still with me Be as in years gone by!âIt may not be; Nor should I wish it: all things have their season: She may not now remain an old man's treasure, With all her woman's beauty grown to blossom. Enter Orceres. The Parthian prince at such an early hour? Or. And who considers hours, whose heart is bent On what concerns a lover and a friend? Where is thy daughter? Sul. Within yon flowery thicket, blithe and careless; For though she loves, 'tis with sweet, maiden fancy, That, not impatient, looks in cheering hope To future years. Or. Ay, 'tis a shelter'd passion, A cradled love, by admiration foster'd: A showy, toward nurse for babe so bashful. Thus in the shell, athwart whose snowy lining Each changeful tint of the bright rainbow plays, A little pearl is found, in secret value Surpassing all the rest. Sul. But sayst thou nothing Of what I wish to hear? What of Cordenius? Or. By my good war-bow and its barbed shafts! By the best war-horse archer e'er bestrode! I'm still in ignorance; I have not seen him. Sul. Thou hast not seen him! this is very strange. Or. So it indeed appears.âMy wayward friend Has from his home been absent. Yesterday, There and elsewhere I sought, but found him not. This morning by the dawn again I sought him, Thinking to find him surely and alone; But his domestics, much amazed, have told me, He is not yet return'd. Sul. Hush! through yon thicket I perceive a man. Or. Some thief or spy. Sul. Let us withdraw awhile, And mark his motions; he observes us not. Enter Cordenius from a thicket in the background. Cor. (after looking round him with delight). Sweet light of day, fair sky, and verdant earth, Enrich'd with every beauteous herb and flower, And stately trees, that spread their boughs, like tents, For shade and shelter, how I hail you now! Ye are His works, who made such fair abodes For happy innocence, yet, in the wreck Of foul perversion, has not cast us off. [Stooping to look at the flowers. Ye little painted things, whose varied hues Charm, e'en to wonderment; that mighty hand Which dyes the mountain's peak with rosy tints Sent from the rising sun, and to the barb'd Destructive lightning gives its ruddy gleam, Grand and terrific, thus adorns even you! There is a father's full unstinted love Display'd o'er all, and thus on all I gaze With the keen thrill of new-waked ecstasy. What voice is that so near me and so sweet? Portia without, singing some notes of prelude, and then a song. SONG. The lady in her early bower Is blest as been in morning flower; The lady's eye is flashing bright, Like water in the morning light; The lady's song is sweet and loud, Like skylark o'er the morning cloud; The lady's smiles are smiles that pass Like morning's breath o'er wavy grass. She thinks of one, whose harness'd car In triumph comes from distant war; She thinks of one whose martial state Will darken Rome's imperial gate; She thinks of one, with laurel crown'd, Who shall with sweeter wreaths be bound. Voice, eye, and smiles, in mingled play, The lady's happy thoughts betray. Cor. Her voice indeed, and this my fav'rite song! It is that gentle creature, my sweet Portia. I call her mine, because she is the image Which hath possess'd my fancy. Such vain thoughts Must now give place. I will not linger here. This is the garden of Sulpicius; How have I miss'd my path? She sings again. [Sings without, as before. She wanders fitfully from lay to lay, But all of them some air that I have praised In happy hours gone by. SONG. The kind heart speaks with words so kindly sweet, That kindred hearts the catching tones repeat; And love, therewith, his soft sigh gently blending, Makes pleasing harmony. Thus softly sending Its passing cheer across the stilly main, While in the sounding water dips the oar, And glad response bursts from the nearing shore, Comes to our ears the home-bound seamen's strain, Who from the lofty deck hail their own land again. Cor. O gentle, sweet, and cheerful! form'd to be Whate'er my heart could prize of treasured love! Dear as thou art, I will not linger here. Re-enter Sulpicius and Orceres, breaking out upon him, and Orceres catching hold of his robe as he is going off. Or. Ha! noble Maro, to a coward turn'd, Shunning a spot of danger! Sul. Stay, Cordenius. The fellest foe thou shalt contend with here, Is she thou callst so gentle. As for me, I do not offer thee this hand more freely Than I will grant all that may make thee happy, If Portia has that power. Cor. And dost thou mean, in very earnest mean, That thou wilt give me Portiaâthy dear Portia? My fancy catches wildly at thy words. Sul. And truly too, Cordenius. She is thine, If thou wilt promise me to love her truly. Cor. (eagerly clasping the knees, and then kissing the hands of Sulpicius). Thanks, thanks! âthanks from my swoln, o'erflowing heart, Which has no words.âFriend, father, Portia's father! The thought creates in me such sudden joy, I am bewilder'd with it. Sul. Calm thy spirits.â Thou shouldst in meeter form have known it sooner, Had not the execution of those Christiansâ (Pests of the earth, whom on one burning pile, With all their kind, I would most gladly punish,) Till now prevented me. Thy friend, Orceresâ Thou owest him thanksâpled for thee powerfully, And had my leave. But dost thou listen to me? Thy face wears many colours, and big drops Burst from thy brow, whilst thy contracted lips Quiver, like one in pain. Or. What sudden illness racks thee? Cor. I may not tell you now: let me depart. Sul. (holding him). Thou art my promised son; I have a right To know whate'er concerns thee,âpain or pleasure. Cor. And so thou hast, and I may not deceive thee. Take, take, Sulpicius.âO such with'ring words! The sinking, sick'ning heart and parched mouth! I cannot utter them. Sul. Why in this agony of perturbation? Nay, strive not now to speak. Cor. I must, I must!â Take back thy proffer'd gift; all earth could give;â That which it cannot give I must retain. Sul. What words were these? If it were possible, I could believe thee touch'd with sorcery, The cursed art of those vile Nazarenes. Where hast thou pass'd the night? their haunts are near. Or. Nay, nay; repress thine anger; noble Maro May not be question'd thus. Sul. He may and shall. And yet I will not urge him, If he, with hand press'd on his breast, will say, That he detests those hateful Nazarenes. Cor. No; though my life, and what is dearer far, My Portia's love, depended on the words, I would not, and I durst not utter them. Sul. I see it well: thou art ensnared and blinded By their enchantments. Demoniac power Will drag thee to thy ruin. Cast it off; Defy it. Say thou wilt forbear all intercourse With this detested sect. Art thou a madman? Cor. If I am mad, that which possesses me Outvalues all philosophers e'er taught, Or poets e'er imagined.âListen to me. Call ye these Christians vile, because they suffer Pains nature shrinks from, rather than deny What seems to them the truth? Call ye them sorcerers, Because their words impart such high conceptions Of power creative and parental love, In one great Being join'd, as makes the heart Bound with ennobling thoughts? Call ye them curst, Who daily live in steady strong assurance Of endless blessedness? O, listen to me! Re-enter Portia, bursting from a thicket close to them. Portia. O, listen to him, father! Sul. Let go my robe, fond creature! Listen to him! The song of syrens were less fatal. Charms Of dire delusion, luring on to ruin, Are mingled with the words that speak their faith; They, who once hear them, flutter round destruction With giddy fascination, like the moth, Which, shorn of half its form, all scorch'd and shrivell'd, Still to the torch returns. I will not listen; No, Portia, nor shalt thou. Portia. O, say not so! For if you listen to him, you may save him, And win him from his errors. Sul. Vain hope! vain hope! What is man's natural reason Opposed to demon subtlety? Cordenius! Cordenius Maro! I adjure thee, go! Leave me; why wouldst thou pull destruction on me? On one who loved thee so, that though possess'd Of but one precious pearl, most dearly priz'd, Prized more than life, yet would have given it to thee. I needs must weep: e'en for thyself I weep. Cor. Weep not, my kind Sulpicius! I will leave thee, Albeit the pearl thou wouldst bestow upon me Is, in my estimation, dearer far Than life, or power, or fame, or earthly thing. When these fierce times are past, thou wilt, perhaps, Think of me with regard, but not with pity, How fell soe'er my earthly end hath been, For I shall then be blest. And thou, dear Portia, Wilt thou remember me? That thought, alas! Dissolves my soul in weakness.â O, to be spared, if it were possible, This stroke of agony! Is it not possible, That I might yetâAlmighty God forgive me! Weak thoughts will lurk in the devoted heart, But not be cherish'd there. I may not offer Aught short of all to Thee!â Farewell, farewell! sweet Portia, fare thee well! [Orceres catches hold of him to prevent his going. Retain me not: I am a Parthian now. My strength is in retreat. [Exit. Portia. That noble mind! and must it then be ruin'd? O save him, save him, father! Brave Orceres, Wilt thou not save thy friend, the noble Maro? Or. We will, sweet maid, if it be possible. We'll keep his faith a secret in our breasts; And he may yet, if not by circumstances Provoked to speak, conceal it from the world. Portia. And you, my father? Sul. I will not betray him. Portia. Then all may yet be well; for our great gods, Whom CÃ¦sar and his subject-nations worship, Will not abandon Rome's best, bravest soldier To power demoniac. That can never be, If they indeed regard us. Or. Were he in Parthia, our great god, the sun, Or rather he who in that star resides, Would not permit his power to be so thwarted For all the demonry that e'er exerted Its baleful influence on wretched men. Beshrew me! for a thought gleams through my brain It is this God, perhaps, with some new name, Which these bewilder'd Nazarenes adore. Sul. With impious rites, most strange and horrible. Or. If he, my friend, in impious rites hath join'd, Demons, indeed, have o'er the soul of man A power to change its nature. Ay, Sulpicius; And thou and I may, ere a day shall pass, Be very Nazarenes. We are in ignorance; We shoot our arrow in the dark, and cry, âIt is to wound a foe.â Come, gentle Portia; Be not so sad; the man thou lovest is virtuous, And brave, and loves thee well; why then despair? Portia. Alas! I know that he is brave and virtuous, Therefore, I do despair. Or. In Nero's court, Such men are ever on the brink of danger, But wouldst thou have him other than he is? Portia. O no! I would not; that were base and sordid; Yet shed I tears, even like a wayward child Who weeps for that which cannot be attain'd,â Virtue, and constancy, and safety join'd. I pray thee pardon me, for I am wretched, And that hath made me foolish and perverse. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. Before the gate of Nero's palace: guards, with their officers, discovered on duty. Enter to them another officer, speaking, as he enters, to the soldiers. 1st offi. Strike up some sacred strain of Roman triumph; The Pontiff comes to meet the summon'd council. Omit not this respect, else he will deem We are of those who love the Nazarenes. Sing loud and clearly. Enter Pontiff, attended. SACRED HYMN by the soldiers.That chief, who bends to Jove the suppliant knee, Shall firm in power and high in honour be; And who to Mars a soldier's homage yields, Shall laurell'd glory reap in bloody fields; Who vine-crown'd Bacchus, bounteous lord, adores, Shall gather still, unscath'd, his vintage stores; Who to fair Venus lib'ral off'ring gives, Enrich'd with love and sweet affection lives. Then, be your praises still our sacred theme, O Venus, Bacchus, Mars, and Jove supreme! Pontiff. I thank you, soldiers! Rome, indeed, hath triumph'd, Bless'd in the high protection of her gods, The sov'reign warrior-nation of the world; And, favour'd by great Jove and mighty Mars, So may she triumph still, nor meanly stoop To worship strange and meaner deities, Adverse to warlike glory. [Exit, with his train. 1st offi. The Pontiff seems disturb'd, his brow is lowering. 2d offi. Reproof and caution, mingled with his thanks, Though utter'd graciously. 1st offi. He is offended, Because of late so many valiant soldiers Have proselytes become to this new worship; A worship too, as he insinuates, Unsuited to the brave. 3d offi. Ay, ay! the sacred chickens are in danger. 2d offi. Sylvius is suspected, as I hear. 1st offi. Hush! let us to our duty; it is time To change the inner guard. [Exeunt, with music, into the gate of the palace. SCENE II. A council-chamber in the palace: Nero with his councillors discovered; Nero in the act of speaking. Nero. Yes, Servius; formerly we have admitted, As minor powers, amongst the ancient gods Of high imperial Rome, the foreign deities Of friendly nations; but these Nazarenes Scorn such association, proudly claiming For that which is the object of their faith, Sole, undivided homage: and our altars, Our stately temples, the majestic forms Of Mars, Apollo, thund'ring Jove himself, By sculptor's art divine so nobly wrought, Are held by these mad zealots in contempt. Examine, sayst thou! shall imperial CÃ¦sar Deign to examine what withstands his power? I marvel at thy folly, Servius Sillus. Enter an Officer. Offi. The Pontiff, mighty CÃ¦sar, waits without And craves admittance. Nero. Let him be admitted. Enter Pontiff. Pontiff, thy visage, if I read it well, Says that some weighty matter brings thee here: Thou hast our leave to speak. Pontiff. Imperial Nero, didst thou not condemn, That eloquent, but pestilential Nazarene, The Grecian Ethocles, whose specious words Wrap in delusion all who listen to him, Spreading his baleful errors o'er the world? Nero. Did I condemn him! E'en this very day, He in the Amphitheatre meets his doom; Having, I trust, no power of words to charm The enchafed lion, or the famish'd wolf. Pontiff. I am inform'd, and I believe it true, That this bold malefactor is enlarged. Nero. It is impossible! Cordenius Maro Is sworn to guard the prisoner; or, failing, (How could he fail?) to pay with his own life The forfeit. But behold his fav'rite friend, The Parthian prince, who will inform us truly. Enter Orceres, followed by Sulpicius. Orceres, is thy friend Cordenius coming? I have commanded him, and at this hour, To bring his guarded prisoner to the palace, Here to remain till the appointed time. Or. I know not; nor have I beheld Cordenius Since yesterday; when, at an early hour, Sulpicius and myself met him by chance: But for the prisoner, he is at hand, E'en at the palace gate; for as we enter'd We saw him there, well circled round with guards, Though in the martial throng we saw not Maro. Nero (to the pontiff). Said I not so? (To an officer.) Command them instantly To bring this wordy Grecian to our presence. [Exit officer. Sulpicius, thou hast known this Ethocles; Is he a madman or ambitious knave, Who sought on human folly to erect A kind of fancied greatness for himself? Sul. I know not which, great Nero. Nero. And didst thou not advise me earnestly To rid the state of such a pestilence? Sul. And so I still advise thee; for this Greek Is dang'rous above all, who with their lives, Have yet paid forfeit for their strange belief. They come: the prisoner in foreign garb So closely wrapp'd, I scarcely see his face. Enter prisoner, attended. Pontiff. If it in truth be he. Nero (to the pontiff). Dost thou still doubt? (To the prisoner.) Stand forth, audacious rebel to my will! Dost thou still brave it, false and subtle spirit? Cor. (throwing off his Grecian cloak, and advancing to Nero). I am not false, Augustus; but if subtle, Add to my punishment what shall be deem'd Meet retribution. I have truly sworn, Or to produce thy thrall, or, therein failing, To give my life for his; and here I stand. Ethocles, by a higher power than thine, Is yet reserved for great and blessed ends. Take thou the forfeit; I have kept my oath. Nero. I am amazed beyond the power of utt'rance! Grows it to such a pitch that Rome's brave captains Are by this wizard sorcery so charm'd? Then it is time, good sooth! that sweeping vengeance Should rid the earth of every tainted thing Which that curst sect hath touch'd. Cordenius Maro, Thou who hast fought our battles, graced our state, And borne a noble Roman's honour'd name, What, O what power could tempt thee to this shame? Cor. I have been tempted by that mighty Power Who gave to Rome her greatness, to the earth Form and existence; yea, and to the soul Of living, active man, sense and perception: But not to shame, O CÃ¦sar! not to shame! Nero. What, hast thou not become a Nazarene, As now I apprehended? Say, thou hast not; And though thy present act is most audacious, Yet will I spare thy life. Cor. If thou wouldst spare my life, and to that grace Add all the wealth of Rome, and all the power Of Rome's great lord, I would not for the bribe Be other than I am, or what I am Basely deny. Nero. Thou art a Christian, then? Thou art a maniac! Cor. I am a man, who, seeing in the flames Those dauntless Christians suffer, long'd to know What power could make them brave the fear of death, Disgrace, and infamy. And I have learnt That they adore a God,âone God, supreme, Who, over all men, His created sons, Rules as a father; and beholding sin, Growth of corruption, mar this earthly race, Sent down to earth His sinless heavenly son, Who left, with generous devoted love, His state of exaltation and of glory, To win them back to virtue, yea, to virtue Which shall be crown'd with never-ending bliss. I've learnt that they with deep adoring gratitude Pay homage to that Son, the sent of God, Who here became a willing sacrifice To save mankind from sin and punishment, And earn for them a better life hereafter, When mortal life is closed. The heart's deep homage Becometh well such creatures, so redeem'd. Nero. Out on that dreaming madness! Cor. Is it madness To be the humble follower of Him, Who left the bliss of heaven to be for us A man on earth, in spotless virtue living, As man ne'er lived: such words of comfort speaking, To rouse, and elevate, and cheer the heart, As man ne'er spoke; and suff'ring poverty, Contempt, and wrong, and pain, and death itself, As man ne'er suffer'd? O, if this be madness, Which makes each generous impulse of my nature Warm into ecstasy, each towering hope Rise to the noblest height of bold conception; That which is reason call'd, and yet has taught you To worship different gods in every clime, As dull and wicked as their worshippers, Compared to it, is poor, confined, and mean, As is the Scythian's curtain'd tent, compared With the wide range of fair, expanded nature. Nero. Away, away, with all those lofty words! They but bewilder thee. Cor. Yet hear them, Nero! O resist them not! Perhaps they are appointed for thy good, And for the good of thousands. When these hands Which have so oft done Rome a soldier's service, This tongue which speaks to thee, are turn'd to ashes, What now appears so wild and fanciful, May be remember'd with far other feelings. It is not life that I request of Nero, Although I said these hands have fought for Rome. No; in the presence of these senators, First bind thyself by every sacred oath To give this body to the flames, then hear me; O could I speak what might convince Rome's chief, Her senators, her tribes, her meanest slaves, Of Christ's most blessed truth, the fatal pile Would be to me a car of joyful triumph, Mounted more gladly than the laurell'd hero Vaults to his envied seat, while Rome's throng'd streets Resound his shouted name. Within me stirs The spirit of truth and power which spoke to me, And will upon thy mindâ Nero. I charge thee cease! Or. Nay, Emperor! might I entreat for him? Cor. (catching hold of Orceres eagerly). Not for my life. Or. No; not for that, brave Maro! (To Nero.) Let me entreat that he may freely speak. Fearst thou he should convince thee by his words? That were a foul affront to thine own reason, Or to the high divinities of Rome. Nero. Cease, Prince of Parthia! nor too far presume Upon a noble stranger's privilege. Pontiff. Shall words so bold be to thine car august So freely utter'd with impunity? Or. Pontiff; I much revere thy sacred office, But scorn thy paltry words. Not freely speak! Not with impunity! Is this a threat? Let Rome's great master, or his angry slaves, Shed one drop of my blood, and on our plains, Where heretofore full many a Roman corse, With Parthian arrows pierced, have vultures fed, Twice thirty thousand archers in array, Each with his bow strain'd for the distant mark, Shall quickly stand, impatient for revenge. Not with impunity! Sul. Nay, nay, Orceres! with such haughty words Thou'lt injure him thou pleadst for. Noble CÃ¦sar! Permit an aged man, a faithful servant, To speak his thoughts. This brave deluded youth Is now, as I sincerely do believe, Beneath the power of strong and dire enchantment. Hear not his raving words, but spare his life; And when its power (for all delusion holds Its power but for a season) shall be spent, He will himself entreat your clemency, And be again the soldier of the state, Brave and obedient. Do not hear him now: Command him to retire. Cor. I thank thee, good Sulpicius, but my life, For which thou pleadst, take no account of that; I yield it freely up to any death, Cruel or merciful, which the decree Of CÃ¦sar shall inflict, for leave to speak E'en but a few short moments. Princely Nero! The strong enchantment which deludes my soul Is, that I do believe myself the creature, Subject, and soldier, if I so may speak, Of an Almighty Father, King, and Lord, Before whose presence, when my soul shall be Of flesh and blood disrobed, I shall appear, There to remain with all the great and good That e'er have lived on earth, yea, and with spirits, Higher than earth e'er own'd, in such pure bliss As human heart conceives not,âif my life, With its imperfect virtue, find acceptance From pard'ning love and merey; but, if otherwise, That I shall pass into a state of misery With souls of wicked men and wrathful demons: That I believe this earth on which we stand Is but the vestibule to glorious mansions, Through which a moving crowd for ever press; And do regard the greatest Prince, who now Inflicts short torment on this flesh, as one Who but in passing rudely rends my robe. And thinkest thou that I, believing this, Will shrink to do His will whom I adore? Or thinkest thou this is a senseless charm, That soon will pass away? Nero. High words, indeed, if resting on good proof! A maniac's fancies may be grand and noble. Cor. Ay, now thou list'nest, as a man should listen, With an inquiring mind. Let me produce The proofs which have constrain'd me to believe, From written lore and well-attested facts;â Let me produce my proofs, and it may be The Spirit of Truth may touch thy yielding heart, And save thee from destruction. Nero. Ha! dost thou think to make of me a convert? Away, weak fool! and most audacious rebel! Give proofs of thy obedience, not thy faith, If thou wouldst earn thy pardon. Cor. If thou condemn me in the flames to die, I will and must obey thee; if to live, Disgraced by pardon won through treachery To God, my King supreme, and His bless'd Christ, I am, indeed, thy disobedient rebel. Nero. And shall as such most dearly pay the forfeit. Out!âtake him from my presence till the time Of public execution! Cordenius Maro, thou shalt fall this day By no ignoble foe;âa noble lion Famish'd and fierce shall be thy adversary. And dost thou smile and raise thy head at this, In stately confidence? Cor. God will deliver me from every adversary. And thou too smilest.âYes; he will deliver That which I call myself. For this poor form Which vests me round, I give it to destruction, As gladly as the storm-beat traveller, Who, having reach'd his destined place of shelter, Drops at the door his mantle's cumbrous weight. Nero (going). Then to thy visionary hopes I leave thee, Incorrigible man! Here, in this chamber Keep him secure till the appointed hour. [To the officers, &amp;c. Off, good Sulpicius! hang not on me thus! Sul. O mighty CÃ¦sar! countermand your orders: Delay it but a month, a week, a day. [Exeunt Nero, Sulpicius, senators, &amp;c., Sulpicius still keeping close to Nero in the act of supplication.âOrceres, Cordenius, and guards remain, the guards standing respectfully at a distance in the background. Or. Noble Cordenius! can thy martial spirit Thus brook to be a public spectacle, Fighting with savage beasts, the sport of fools, Till thou shalt fall, deform'd and horrible, Mangled and piecemeal torn? It must not be. Cor. Be not so moved, Orceres; I can bear it: The God I worship, who hath made me humble, Hath made me dauntless too. And for the shame Which, as I guess, disturbs thee most, my Master, The Lord and Leader I have sworn to follow, Did as a malefactor end his days, To save a lost, perverted race: shall I Feel degradation, then, in following Him? Or. In this, alas! thou'lt follow Him too surely; But whither, noble Maro? Cor. E'en to my destined home, my Father's [house. Or. And where is that? O, canst thou tell me where? Beyond the ocean, or beneath the earth? Be there more worlds than this, beyond our ken In regions vast, above the lofty stars? Could we through the far stretch of space descry E'en but the distant verge, though dimly mark'd, Of any other world, I would believe That virtuous men deceased have in good truth A destined place of rest. Cor. Believe itâO, believe it, brave Orceres! Or. I'll try to do it. I'll become a Christian, Were it but only to defy this tyrant. Cor. Thou must receive with a far different spirit The faith of Jesus Christ. Perhaps thou wilt. My heart leaps at the thought. When I am dead, Remain in Rome no longer. In the East Search thou for Ethocles, whom I have rescued; And if he shall convert thee, O how richly He will repay all I have done for him!â But I would now withdraw a little space, To pour my thoughts in prayer and thankfulness To Him, the great, the good, the wise, the just, Who holds man's spirit in His own high keeping, And now supports my soul, and will support it, Till my appointed task is done. In secret The hearts by Jesus taught were bid to pray, And, if it be permitted, so will I. (To the guards, who advance as he speaks to them.) My guards, and, some time past, my fellow soldiers, Let me remain alone a little while, And fear not my escape. If ye distrust me, Watch well the door, and bind my hands with chains! 1st offi. Yes, brave Cordenius, to another chamber Thou mayst retire, and we will watch without. But be thy person free: we will not bind, With felon cord or chain, those valiant hands, Which have so often for thy country fought, Until we are commanded. Cor. I thank you all, my friends, and I believe That I shall meet and thank you too hereafter; For there is something in you God must love. (To 1st officer.) And, loving, will not give to reprobation. Codrus, thou once didst put thy life in hazard, And suffer much to save a helpless Greek Who sought protection of thee. (Turning to the 2d officer.) Ay, and thou, Young Lelius, once a rich and tempting ransom Didst freely to a captive wretch remit. Ye are of those whom Jesus came to save: Yes; we shall meet hereafter. (To 3d officer.) And thou, my former enemy, weep'st thou? We're enemies no more; thou art my brother. I will retire; my little term of life Runs fleetly on; I must not spend it thus. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A crowded amphitheatre: Nero and the senators discovered in the background sitting in state; Portia, by the side of Nero, in the act of supplication. Enter Sulpicius on the front, meeting with another noble Roman. Sul. (eagerly). Is he advancing? Noble Roman. Yes, and close at hand, Surrounded by a group of martial friends. Oft have I seen him on a day of battle March to the charge with noble portly gait; But now he treads the ground with buoyant steps Which from its surface spring, as though he press'd Substance of renovating power. His form Seems stately and enlarged beyond its wont; And in his countenance, oft turn'd to heaven, There is a look as if some god dwelt in him. Sul. How do the people greet him? Noble Roman. Every face Gazing upon him, turns, with transit quick, Pity to admiration. Warlike veterans Are shedding tears like infants. As he pass'd The legion he commanded in Armenia, They raised a shout as if a victor came, Saluting him with long and loud applause, None daring to reprove them. [Noise without of shouting. Hark! he comes. Enter Cordenius, followed by Orceres and Sylvius, and attended by other friends, with guards, &amp;c. Sul. (advancing eagerly to meet him). Cordenius, Cordenius, hear a friend, A faithful ancient friend; thy Portia's father! At Nero's footstool she is pleading for thee, And will not plead in vain, if thou wilt testify A yielding mind, a willingness to live. Cor. I am so pleased to die, and am so honour'd In dying for the pure and holy truth, That nature's instinct seems in me extinguish'd. But if the Emperor freely pardon me, I shall believe it is the will of God That I should yet on earth promote His service, And, so believing, am content to live; Living or dying, to His will resign'd. Enter Portia on the front, and catching hold of Cordenius with eagerness and great agitation. Portia. Cordenius, thou art pardon'd! Nero spares thee, If thou wilt only say thou art a Roman, In heart and faith, as all thy fathers were, Or but forbear to say thou art a Christian. Cor. Thanks, gentle Portia! life preserved by thee, E'en to be spent in want and contumely, Rather than grieve thy kind and tender heart, My dearest, gentlest friend! I had accepted: But to deny my God, and put dishonour Upon the noblest, most exalted faith That ever was to human thoughts reveal'd, Is what I will notâyea, and though a Roman, A noble Roman, and a soldier too, I dare not do. Let Nero have this answer. Portia. No, not this answer, Maro; not this answer! Cast not life from thee, dear, most dear Cordenius! Life, too, which I should spend my life in cheering, Cast it not from thee like a worthless thing. Cor. Because it is not worthless but most precious, And now, when dear to thee, more precious far Than I have e'er esteem'd it, 'tis an offering More meet for God's acceptance; Withheld from Him, not even thyself, sweet maid, Couldst cheer its course, nor yet couldst thou be happy. Portia. Nay, but I could!âto see thee still alive, And by my side, mine own redeemed friend, Should I not then be happy? Cor. I should be by thy side, dear love! but thou, With all thy excellence, couldst have no happiness, Mated with one, whose living form alone Could move upon the earth, while far adrift His mind would dwell by ceaseless meditation, In other worlds of blessedness or woe; Lost to the one, and to the other link'd By horrid sympathy, till his wrench'd nature Should to a demon's fell and restless spirit At last be changed. Portia. Alas, alas! and dost thou then believe That nought remains for thee but death or misery? Cor. No, gentle Portia! firmly I believe That I shall live in endless happiness, And with the blest hereafter shall behold Thy blessed self with ecstasy of love, Exceeding every thought of earth-born passion, As the fair morning star in lovely brightness Excels a night-fly, twinkling through the gloom. Live in this hope, dear Portia! hold it fast; And may His blessing rest upon thy head, Who loves the loving and the innocent! Farewell, in love and hope! farewell, in peace! Farewell, in quick'ning faith,âin holy joy! Portia (clasping his knees). Nay, let me yet conjure thee! Make me not wretched, I who once was happy, And happiest of all in loving thee. Cor. This is my anguish and my suffering! O, good Sulpicius, bear her to her home. Sul. (leading her gently away, while she still clings to him). Forbear, my child, thy tears are all in vain. Enter a Lictor. Lictor. CÃ¦sar forbids all further interruption To his imperial sentence. Let Cordenius Forthwith prepare him for the fatal fight. This is mine office, and I must perform it. [Begins to disrobe Cordenius, while Portia shrieks aloud, and is carried off in the arms of her father. Disrobe thee, Maro, of those martial weeds. Cor. Gladly! for Him I serve;âmy glorious Master Hath braced me with an armour that defies All hostile things; in which I'll strive more proudly Than I have ever fought in field or breach With Rome's or Nero's foes. Lictor. CÃ¦sar desires thee also to remember, That no ignoble audience, e'en thy Emperor, And all the states of Rome, behold thy deeds. Cor. Tell him my deeds shall witness'd be by those Compared to whom the Emperor of Rome, With all her high estates, are but as insects Hov'ring at mid-day o'er some tainted marsh. I know full well that no ignoble audience Are present, though from mortal eyes conceal'd. Farewell, my friends! kind, noble friends, farewell! [Apart to Sylvius, while Orceres goes off, re-appearing in another part of the theatre. Sylvius, farewell! If thou shouldst e'er be call'd To die a holy martyr for the truth, God give thee then the joy which now I feel. But keep thy faith conceal'd, till useful service Shall call thee to maintain it. God be with thee! (Looking round.) Where is Orceres gone? I thought him near me. Sylvius. 'Tis but a moment since he left thy side With eager haste. Cor. He would not see my death. I'm glad he's gone. Say I inquired for him, and say I bless'd him. âNow I am ready. Earthly friends are gone. Angels and blessed spirits! to your fellowship A few short pangs will bring me. âO, Thou, who didst upon the cross for us A willing suff'rer die, receive my soul! Almighty God and Sire, supreme o'er all, Pardon my sins and take me to Thyself! Accept the last words of my earthly lips: High hallelujah to Thy holy name! [A lion now appears, issuing from a low door at the end of the stage, and Cordenius, advancing to meet it, enters the arena, when Orceres from a lofty stand amongst the spectators, sends an arrow from his bow, which pierces Cordenius through the heart. He then disappears, and re-entering below, catches hold of his hand as Sylvius supports him from falling to the ground. Or. (to Cordenius). Have I done well, my friend?âthis is a death More worthy of a Roman. I made a vow in secret to my heart, That thou shouldst ne'er be made a mangled sight For gazing crowds and Nero's ruthless eye. Sylvius. That dying look, which almost smiles upon thee, Tells thee thou hast done well; though words no more May pass from these clos'd lips, whose last, bless'd utterance Was the soul's purest and sublimest impulse. [The curtain drops. NOTE TO THE DRAMA. For the better understanding of different allusions in the foregoing drama. I beg to transcribe a few passages from Fox's History of Martyrs, taken from Book I., which contains an account of the ten persecutions of the primitive church. He says, on the authority of Justin Martyr,ââAnd whether earthquake, pestilence, or whatever public calamity befell, it was attributed to the Christians;â (then is added) âover and beside all these, a great occasion that stirred up the emperors against the Christians came by one Publius Tarquinius, the chief prelate of the idolatrous sacrifices, and Mamertinus, the chief governor of the city, in the time of Trajanus, who, partly with money, partly with sinister, pestilent counsaile, partly with infamous accusations, (as witnesseth Nauclerus,) incensed the mind of the emperor so much against God's people.â In the account of the third persecution (AN. 100, Eustasius, a great and victorious captain, is mentioned as suffering martyrdom, by order of the Emperor Adrian, who went to meet him on his return from conquest over the barbarians, but, upon Eustasius's refusing on the way to do sacrifice to Apollo for his victory, brought him to Rome and had him put to death. In the fourth persecution (AN. 162), it is mentioned that many Christian soldiers were found in the army of Marcus Aurelius:â âAs these aforesaid were going to their execution, there was a certain souldiour who in their defence took part against those who rayled upon them, for the which cause the people crying out against him, he was apprehended, and being constant in his profession, was forthwith beheaded.â In the persecutions of Decius, several soldiers are mentioned as martyrs, some of whom had before concealed their faith: and in the tenth persecution, Mauritius, the captain of the Theban band, with his soldiers, to the number of 6666 (a number probably greatly exaggerated), are recorded as having been slain as martyrs by the order of Maximinian. Tertullian, in his Apology for the Christians, mentions the slanderous accusations against them, of putting to death children and worshipping an ass's head. And when we consider how fond the ignorant are of excitement, arising from cruel, absurd, and wonderful stories, and how easily a misap-prehended and detached expression may be shaped by conjecture into a detailed transaction, such accusations were very probable and might be naturally expected; particularly when the unoffending meekness of their behaviour made supposed hidden atrocities more necessary for the justification of their persecutors. THE SEPARATION: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Garcio, an Italian count. Rovani, his friend. Gonzalos, an old officer. The Marquis of Tortona. Ludovico, seneschal of the castle. Gauvino, chamberlain. Pietro, servant. Gomez, servant. Hermit, &amp;c. &amp;c.WOMEN Margaret, wife to Garcio. Sophera, her attendant and friend. Nurse, &amp;c. Scene, a small state in Italy. ACT I. SCENE I. A chamber, with a great screen at the bottom of the stage, behind which part of a bed is seen, and voices heard as the curtain draws up, while Pietro and Gomez are discovered on the front, looking from a half-opened door, as if listening. Gomez. What said he last? the word died on his tongue. Pie. So much the better. Gomez. Makes he confession? Hast thou listen'd long? He ever wore, e'en in his days of health, The scowling eye of an unquiet mind, And some black deed disturbs his end. E'en so; Thy face confirms it. Pie. We shall be discover'd. [Exeunt, shutting the door softly, while Ludovico and Gauvino come forward from behind the screen. Gau. (looking earnestly at Ludovico, before he speaks). What thinkst thou of it? Lud. It is very strange. Gau. 'Tis but the fever'd ravings of disease: Hast thou more serious thoughts? Lud. I would our good confessor were arrived, Whate'er my thoughts may be. Gau. Ay; then I can divine them. To my judgment, He speaks like one more forced to utterance By agony of mind than the brain's sickness. The circumstances of the horrid deed; The wondrous fleetness of his gallant steed Which bore Count Garcio through the forest pathsâ Lud. Cease, cease! I would the father were arrived. Gau. It was his fav'rite steed, and yet he ne'er Made mention of its name or of its end, But, when we praised its fleetness, frown'd in silence. I've wonder'd oft at this, but thought no ill. Lud. Nor think it now. It is not credible,â Making, as then he did, a lover's suit To the fair Margaret, Ulrico's sister,â That he should murder him. Gau. He was the heir of all Ulrico's lands. Lud. True; so he was. Gau. Ulrico loved him not, and oft opposed His suit as most presumptuous. But for this, Her brother's sudden end, the lovely maid Had ne'er been Garcio's wife. Lud. All this is true; and yet, perhaps, those facts Have on the mind of this poor dying wretch Impress'd dark fancies, which the fever'd brain Shapes into actual deed. Oh, it is horrible! Canst thou believe one of his noble race Could do a deed befitting ruffian hands, And only such? Had he thus wickedly Devised Ulrico's death, some hired assassin Had done the bloody work, not his own hands. Gau. Well, but what thinkst thou of his strange aversion To this, the goodliest seat our country boasts? Although his countess oft hath urged him to it, He hath not since his marriage here resided,â Nay, hath not pass'd a night within these walls: And, but that he is absent at the wars, E'en though the recent earthquake has in ruins His other castle laid, and forced us thence, This mansion had remain'd untenanted. Lud. I would the ghostly father were arrived! (Voice heard behind the screen.) Blood will accuse: âam I not cursed for this? Lud. He speaks again: I thought that for the while He had been sunk into a state of stupor. Go thou and watch by him, Gauvino; haste! For steps approach, and none must be admitted. [Gauvino retires behind the screen; and Ludovico, running to the door, meets Sophera, and endeavours to prevent her entering. Thou mayst not come: he's still; he is asleep: Thou canst not see him. [Voice heard again. Soph. Asleep, sayst thou? do I not hear his voice? Nay, let me pass; I will not be withheld. My lady follows me with some good drug To chafe his brow, poor wretch! and give him comfort. Lud. Return, and tell the countess to forbear: She must not see him; foul unwholesome air Has made the chambers noxious. Hie thee back, And say she must not come. Soph. And dost thou think this will prevent her? Never, E'en from the sick-bed of her meanest servant, Hath she stood fearfully aloof, when comfort Could be administer'd. I've seen the pain-rack'd wretch smile in his pain To see his lady's sweetly pitying face Peep past his ragged curtain, like a gleam Of kindly sunshine, bidding him good morrow. And thinkst thou now, from this poor dying man, The oldest faithful follower of her lord, To keep her back with such a plea as this? Lud. Cease! urge no more. Return; she must not come: The sick man is distorted-grown, and changed, Fearful to look upon: a lady's gentleness May not such sight abide. Soph. A poor excuse! Hast thou forgotten when those wounded soldiers Lay near our walls, after a bloody skirmish Left on the field from which their comrades fled, How she did stand with steady master'd pity, 'Midst horrid sights from which her women fled With looks averted, till each bleeding wretch Was bound and comforted? Distorted, sayst thou! Who goes to chambers of discase and death To look on pleasant sights? (Voice again.) I did not murder him. Soph. He spoke of murder! [Ludovico pressing her back as she advances eagerly towards the screen, whilst Gauvino comes forward to assist him. Lud. Thou shalt as soon pass through my body, fool! Such cursed obstinacy! art thou mad? If thou regardst thy lady's peace of mind, Fly, I conjure thee, and prevent her coming. Enter Countess behind them. Countess. And why, good Ludovico? Lud. (who starts on seeing her). Gracious heaven! Countess. Why lookst thou so aghast! Is Baldwin dead? Lud. He is; and therefore go not. [She still endeavours to pass. No, no! he is not; be entreated, madam! Countess. What cause so strangely moves thee? Lud. A powerful cause, that must not be reveal'd. O, be entreated then! (Voice again.) Ulrico's blood was shed by Garcio's hand, Yet I must share the curse. Lud. Run to him quickly! wherefore didst thou leave him? [Gauvino again retires as before. Countess. What words were those he utter'd? Lud. Words of despair and frenzy; heed them not, But quit the chamber. O, for heaven's sake, go! [Exeunt; Ludovico hurrying off the Countess and Sophera. SCENE II. A small ante-room or passage. Enter Pietro and Gomez by opposite sides. Gomez. Is the confessor with poor Baldwin still? Pie. He is; but, as I guess, will leave him presently; I heard, just now, the chamber-door unlock'd. I'll keep my station here, and see him pass. Gomez. And so will I. Ha! yonder, see, he comes. Pietro. His head bends to the ground, and o'er his eyes His hood is drawn: would I could see his face! He is the cousin of our seneschal,â I'll speak to him. Enter a Friar, walking hastily across the stage. Good father! give your blessing: How is your penitent? [Friar waves him off with his hand, and exil. Gomez. He motions with his hand and will not speak. Pie. In so much haste to go! this is not well. [Shaking his head. No, no! it hath a dark and rueful look. Well; God be praised! these hands are free from blood. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The apartment of the Countess; she is discovered pacing to and fro with slow, thoughtful steps, then stops short, and stands in a musing posture some time before she speaks aloud. Countess. 'Tis often thus; so are we framed by nature. How oft the fitful wind or sullen bell Will utter to the ear distinctive words, According with the fancy's wild conceptions! So are the brains of sick and frenzied men Stored with unreal and strange imaginations. (After a short pause.) Am I become a maniac? Oh! have words, To which the firm conviction of my mind So strongly stands opposed, the baleful power To fix this misery on me? This is madness! Enter Sophera behind. Is't thou, Sophera? Soph. Yes, 'tis only I. Countess. Is every decent office of respect Done to the corse? Soph. Yes, nought has been omitted. Countess. 'Tis well; but what detains the good confessor? I wish'd to see him. Soph. He stay'd but till his wretched penitent Had breathed his last, and quickly left the castle. Countess. He is in haste, methinks; 'tis somewhat strange. Why lookst thou on me with that fearful eye? Thinkst thou the ravings of a frenzied mind Have power to move me? Soph. I only thoughtâI fear'dâyou wisely judge; Why should they move you? Well, the dismal story Of that most dismal murder, here committed By hands unknown, might to a sickly brain Such thoughts create of nothing. Countess. What sayst thou? here committed! Soph. Did not your hapless brother in this castle Come to his end? Countess. Yes, but a natural end. Soph. So grant it were! it is not so reported. Countess. Ha! what is else reported? Soph. The peasants round all idle stories credit; And say that in his castle, by his servants, He was discover'd in the eastern tower Murder'd. But, doubtless, 'tis a tale of falschood, Since 'tis to thee unknown. Countess (sinking back into a chair). It was to me unknown. (After a long pause.) Dear, dear! the friend, the brother of my heart, The playmate of my early, happy days, Could such a fate be thine! It makes me weep to think it possible, Yet I believe it not. Soph. You tremble much. Countess. I'm cold and chill: 'tis weariness of body; Do not regard it; I shall soon be better. [Trumpet sounds without. A trumpet! then some martial guest approaches. O most unwelcome! Soph. 'Tis Tortona's Marquis. Countess. He is not in these parts; it cannot be. Soph. He is upon his march with some gay troops To join the army, and hath made a halt Here in our nearest town to rest his men. So said his servant, whom I found this morning Lurking within the castle; and I guess His warlike lord is come. Countess. I cannot see him. Go thou; plead my excuse: I am unwell; Say what thou wilt, but let me be excused. Enter Rovani. Rovani here!âO, how is this? My lord? Rov. He is not far behind. I am, fair lady, The vanguard of his band; and, as I trust, Bearing no dismal tidings. Countess. O no! they should, indeed, be joyful, ifâ And, as in truth I trustâmy lord is well! Rov. Yes; from the wars, unhurt and strong in health, Garcio returns! where he has done the service Of an undaunted powerful combatant, To that of a right skilful leader join'd. He is not one of your reserved chiefs, Who, pointing with their dainty fingers, thus, Say, âGo, my friends, attack yon frowning ranks.â No, by my faith! with heavy scimitar He closes to the bloody work himself, And to the carnage of each grizly field Brings his full tale of death. Countess (shrinking back). Is he so ruthless, then? Rov. Ay, in the field. But in your hall or bower, where ladies smile, Who is more gentle? Thus it often is: A lady feels not on her soldier's hand, That softly presses her more gentle palm, The deaths which it has dealt. Soph. I'm sure, were but thy rapier like thy tongue, The count must have in thee an able second. Rov. I may not boast; but doth my circled finger More rudely press thy snowy arm, fair maid, Because this graven jewel was the gift Of a great Moorish princess, whose rude foe I slew before her eyes? Soph. Some angry puppy that with snarling mouth Snapp'd at her robe or sandal'd heels, belike. Rov. Nay, by my faith! a foe in worth mine equal. Soph. That I will grant thee readily. But say, How far behind thee is the noble count? Countess. Ay, is he near? Rov. Within a few short miles. The war has ended sooner than we guess'd, And we have made good speed. Countess. So near! Rov. How is it? This affects you strangely. Countess. Such unexpected news! I should be glad, But gladness comes with pain. I will retire, And for a moment strive to calm this tremor. To Sophera.) Follow me not. [Exit. Rov. (looking after her as she goes off). I have, ere now, beheld the sudden news Of a good lord's return from foreign lands By wedded dame received; but so received, Never till now. How's this? What is the matter? How shall a simple bachelor, as I am, Have thoughts of this bless'd state, if such as she Cold and capricious prove? Soph. Blame her not hastily; she is depress'd: Old Baldwin, whom his master left behind, That faithful servant, died with us this morning. Rov. Alas, poor soul! and he is gone at last! Well, we have brought you thirsty throats enow To drink his fun'ral wassails. Ay, poor Baldwin! A hardy knave thou wast in better days. If I had known of this, heav'n rest his soul! I had not sounded my approach so cheerly. Soph. To tell the truth, that martial sound deceived us. We took you for Tortona's warlike lord, Who, to refresh his passing troops, we hear, Has made a halt:âI thoughtâ Rov. Out with thy thought! Why dost thou hesitate?âI will explain it. I've brought you disappointment. Soph. You mistake me. Rov. Nay, pardon me; I linger here too long: But,âere I go,âhow does the infant heir? I must tell Garcio I have seen his boy, Soph. With pleasure I'll conduct thee. 'Tis an urchin Provoking smiles of love from every face That looks upon him, be it e'er so stern. Rov. How then will a fond father feel!âHow oftâ How oft and fondly hath he talk'd of him! Though but a little grasp of shapeless life, With puling whine, just winking to the light, As I remember well, when Garcio left him. Soph. Is Garcio, then, so tender? Rov. Dost thou doubt it? The bear doth love his cub, bear though he be: But Garcio is a man of strong affections. Come, pray thee, lead. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. A wild alley with a grove behind. Martial music heard without. Then enter Garcio with his soldiers on march, and Gonzalos. Gar. Halt, my brave comrades; here we'll rest awhile Till sultry noon be past. Those spreading trees Will give you shade. To Gonzalos.) Seest thou Rovani coming? Gon. No, good my lord; but through the trees I see Your castle's turrets brighten'd with the sun. Look there! it is a fair, enliv'ning sight. Gar. turning away, after a hasty look). I see, I see.âBut wherefore stays Rovani! To soldiers.) Go, choose, each as he lists, his spot of rest; I'll keep me here. [Gonzalos and the soldiers retire to the bottom of the stage, but still appear partially through the trees. After musing some time.) An infant's life! What is an infant's life? the chilly blast, That nips the blossom, o'er the cradle breathes, And child and dam like blighted sweetness fade. If this should be! O, dear, uncertain bliss! Shame on his tardy steps!âHa! here he comes! Enter Rovani, while Garcio runs up to him eagerly. They are alive? they're well? And thou hast seen them? Rov. Your lady and your son? Gar. impatiently). Ay, ay! Rov. They're well. Gar. Thank heav'n, they are!âBut yet thy words are slow: Does she not follow thee? Waits she my coming? Rov. She surely does expect it. Gar. What voice, what looks are these? O speak more freely! If there be merey in thee, speak more freely! [Pauses and looks earnestly at him. Something is wrongâI have nor wife nor child! Rov. They are both well: have I not spoken plain words? Gar. Plain words! yes, baldly plain; reserved and heartless. Thou dost not use me like a fellow soldier, In the same warfare worn.âWhat hast thou seen? Thou sayst my lady's well: did she receive, With a wife's joy, the news of my return? Rov. I am not skill'd to say; for dispositions Of various hues are variously affected. The news were sudden and unlook'd for: oft The joy of such is clouded and disturb'd. She did withdraw in secrecy to hide Her strong emotions. Gar. She was strongly moved? Rov. I know not how it was. The servants, too, Whisper'd together as I pass'd, and look'd With a strange staring gravity upon me. Dull clowns! who should have cast their caps in air For joy of your return. Baldwin is dead; And if for him they wear those sombre looks, Good piteous souls they are. A courtly damsel, Attending on the countess, did, forsooth! Mistake my trumpet for the glad arrival Of some gay visitor, who was expected; Whose buxom train, no doubt, contains some youth More grateful to her sight than war-worn knight, Such as my paltry self. Gar. What visitor? Rov. That very martial lord, The Marquis of Tortona, save his worth! For he conducts his soldiers through these parts, And makes a halt in this fair neighbourhood, Some days or so, for needful recreation. [A pause. What! stay we here to ruminate upon it? Will that avail?âCome, onward to the castle! And, be our welcome there or cold or kind, 'Tis what heav'n sends us. Gar. Off; disturb me not! Thy heart is light. Rov. No, Garcio; 'tis not light If thine be heavy. I have told my tale Too well I see it nowâbut foolishly: Yet their cold looks provoked me.âBrood not on it: There is one face, at least, within your walls Will smile on you with sweet and guileless smiles: A noble boy,âmight call a monarch father, Ay, by my faith! and do him honour, too. Gar. Does he lisp sounds already?âAnd so lovely? I've found tears now, press'd being that I am! Come then; I'll summon strength: whate'er betide, Or good or ill, I'll meet it. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An apartment in the castle. Enter Countess and Sophera. Countess. He is within the gates; here will I stop, Nor wander further: I'll receive him here. Listening.) Heaven give me strength! his well known steps so near me! Enter Garcio; he runs eagerly to embrace the Countess, who faints. Gar. So moved! Can this be joy? [Sophera chafes her hands and temples, while Garcio gazes on her with keen observation: she recovers. My gentle love, Who wast my gentle love, come I upon thee Like some unlook'd for,âsome unwelcome thing? Countess. Is it thy voice, my Garcio, in mine cars Sounding, as it was wont, the voice of love? Gar. How should it sound to thee? The wars have spared me: The bullet and the sabre's stroke have err'd, To spare this head, where thousands fell around me; For I believed thy saintly prayers did mar Their death-commission'd power. Yes; I believed it. Countess. And still believe it. Yes, my prayers were raised Most fervently to heav'n: and I will bless it, That thou art safe. [Takes his hand in hers tenderly, and is about to press it to her breast, when a shuddering seizes her, and she lets it drop. Gar. What is the matter? Thou art strangely seized. Does sudden illness chill thee? Soph. The countess, good my lord, is much o'ercome. Her health is weak at present: agitation Strongly affects her. But she'll soon recover. Gar. Thou answ'rest for her readily, young lady, And wisely too. Enter Rovani, followed by Nurse, carrying a sleeping infant. Rov. Come on, good nurse; thou needst not be ashamed To show thy bantling, sleeping or awake. A nobler, comelier, curly-pated urchin Ne'er changed the face of stern and warlike sire To tearful tenderness. Look here, my lord. Gar. turning eagerly round). The child! my child! [Lifting the mantle that covers it, and gazing on the infant. Rov. Ay, there are cheeks and lips like roses glowing; And, see, half-open'd eyelids show within The dewy azure of his sleeping eyes, Like loopholes in a cloud. Awake, sweet imp! Gar. Nay, wake him not; his sleep is beautiful. Let me supportâCome to my stirring heart, And here be cradled, thing of wondrous joy! [Taking the child. Here, in the inmost core of beating life, I'd lodge thee. Mine thou art! yes, thou art mine! Here is my treasured being: thou wilt love me. [Laying his face close to the child's. Bless'd softness! little hand and little cheek! This is a touch so sweet! a blessed touch! There is love in it; love that will not change! [Bursting into tears, while the nurse takes the child again. Countess (aside, observing his emotion). O heaven, he weeps!âthe tears of strong affection! Away, base doubts! [Running to him, and clasping her arms round him. Garcio, dear Garcio! husband of my heart, And father of my boy! is there within thee Such soft and strong affection? O, there is! And with it every good and generous feeling. Forgive me, O forgive me! Gar. How, my love? How wakes this sudden burst of tenderness? Dost thou at last feel for thy wretched husband The love of other days?âI've thought of theeâ I've thought of this our meeting, but, alas! Not so my fancy shaped it. Countess. O, forgive me! My mind was weak and brooded on dark thoughts. We'll cast them from us.âYes, thy child, thy boy! Look on him still: they say that in his face There are some traits of thine. Observe his mouth; That smileâ Gar. Nay, that sweet smile I could not give him; No, nor those lips. He much resembles thee. Countess. Thinkest thou so? Then haply thou perceiv'st Another likeness some have sadly traced; Dost thou perceive it? Gar. No: another likeness? Countess. In my sad lonely hours, I have imagined, And sooth'd me with the pleasing, mournful thought, He bears some faint resemblance to my brother, My poor Ulrico. [Garcio 's countenance becomes stern, and looking again steadfastly on the child, he turns away in silence. It does not strike thee, then? Gar. (motioning the nurse to retire). We shall disturb his slumbers. Countess (to him reproachfully). Sent off without a kiss of kind endearment? Gar. We should disturb him. [Looking after the child as he is carried off. Countess. Thine eye pursues him with a mournful look: Thou fearst, perhaps, an early fate may snap His thread of life, like his lamented uncle's. Gar. No; past and future are but shadowy visions; Dark cumbrous things which we must cast aside To make the present hour endurable. Who waits without?âA cup of wine, I pray; I'm tired and faint. Countess. Indeed, thou seemst unwell: I fear thou bringst not back thy wonted health. Gar. I'm well,âI was in health, but this damp region, I breath not in it but with breath suppress'd. Thou knowst right well I never liked this place: Why art thou here? Countess. It is necessity. Gar. I know: I know; but other homes there are; We'll hence to-morrow. Countess. Ha! so soon, my lord? Gar. It must be so. I would retire awhile; Where is my chamber? Countess. In the western tower. Gar. No; I'll remainâI will not yet retire. [Pacing to and fro, and then returning to her. I know not how it is; I'm fanciful; I like a southern chamber. Countess in a faint voice, gazing fearfully upon him). E'en as you will. [Sophera, who has during the greater part of this scene retired to the bottom of the stage with Rovani, now comes forward. Soph. Please you, my lord, to go, I will conduct you Where many fair apartments wait your choice. Gar. I thank thee, courteous maid. [Exit Sophera, followed by Garcio; and the Countess, after a thoughtful pause, is about to break into strong exclamations, when, perceiving Rovani, she checks herself and goes out hastily. Rov. coming forward, and looking after her). All is not well: that step, those looks, those gestures, So quickly check'd when she perceived me near, Betray too visibly a mind disturb'd And far removed from joy. Garcio is come Unwelcomely upon her. Yet that burst Of what appear'd like tenderness and love When he caress'd his child!âI cannot think She has in act been false; though much I doubt. Enter Gonzalos behind him. Gon. Ha! mutt'ring to thyself! what are thy thoughts? Rov. Faith! ill-condition'd, moody, foolish thoughts, Such as lone men, whose heart no kind mate cheers, Alone could harbour.âHeaven forgive me for it! I think our lady here had been well pleased If this, her valiant lord, had from the wars Return'd more leisurely.âHer quondam lover, The Marquis of Tortona, in the neighbourhood With his gay troops, bound for some petty fray By them, in lofty phrase, ycleped war, Has made a halt, andâ Gon. Fie! thou canst not think That she could turn her heart from valiant Garcio To such a fool as he? Rov. Yet such strange things have happen'd.â True, indeed, So vile a change could not at once be made. But let us now imagine some soft dame, Whose valiant lord is absent, in her castle Spending her dull lone days. [Changing his voice, and speaking fantastically. âHa! who comes here?ââ âGood madam,â saith her waiting gentlewoman, âA knight is at your gate.âââHe shall not enter: It is a fool; go, bid him wend his way.ââ âAnd will you be so rude?âââAy, true indeed; Then, for good courtesy, since it must be, E'en bid him enter:â'tis a harmless fool.ââ âGood day, fair dame.âââThe same to you, Sir Knight.ââ âMight I presumeâbut how can words express it, The sunshine of your beauty dazzles so!â You will not chide me hence? What gentle goodness! Dear, precious moments, but so swiftly gone!ââ Then whispers low the waiting gentlewoman, âMadam, may he return another day?ââ âWell, well, he may, since thou wilt have it so. It is in truth an amiable fool.â Gon. Fy, fy, Rovani! art thou not ashamed? Who would believe, in hearing thee expatiate On woman's weakness thus, that thou thyself Art but a poor dependent on her favour For all the bloom and sparkle of thy beingâ A very daily beggar of her smiles! Rov. I, sayst thou? Where, in what nook of the earth, Lives she for whom I sigh? Gon. Nay, rather ask in what nook of the earth She liveth not. There's ne'er a moving thing, That wears upon its form a woman's weed, Be it or short or tall, or pale or buxom, Or young or old, but thou dost roll thine eye, And writhe thy body to fantastic shapes Of affectation, to attract her notice. Rov. Nay, spare me, good Gonzalos! I, perhaps, May, as I speak my jest or merry tale, With restless eye keep peering to the side Where beauty listens, too apparently; But think not this attack on female constancyâ I mean this present individual pushâ By any other motive has been prompted, Than love and true regard for noble Garcio. After the toils and dangers he has pass'd, To see him thus received provokes me much. Gon. Hush! be more prudent; speak thy mind less freely. Thy brain is ever full of idle fancies: Come to the air, and cool thy fev'rish spleen. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Before the gate of the castle. Enter Ludovico, Gauvino, and some inferior domestics from the gate, while martial music is heard without. Gau. (to Ludovico, after looking off the stage). 'Tis as I guess'd; look, Mr. Seneschal! They bear the ensigns of Tortona. See! Their chief himself is marching in the van. Lud. And, by my fay! a warlike face he wears, Lofty and grim. Gau. Ay; full of awful terrors For quaking drum-boys and poor piping elves. Lud. Comes he to visit thus our valiant lord, And show his warlike state? Heaven mend his wit! Enter Tortona, with a few followers, in martial array. Tor. Be not alarm'd, good sirs: though thus in arms, We at your lady's gate are harmless visitors, Who humbly crave admittance. [Ludovico, as seneschal, steps forward to receive him with courtesy, while Gauvino mutters to himself. Gau. Mighty man! What bless'd forbearance! For our lady's sake, He will not slay and eat us for a meal! Tor. to Ludovico). Good Mr. Seneschal, inform thy lady That I, Tortona's Marquis, and her slave, Most humbly beg permission at her feetâ But here comes opportunity more tempting: A gentler messenger. Enter Sophera. Gau. aside to Ludovico). Great condescending man! superb humility! Tor. to Sophera). Fair lady! most becoming, as I guess, The beauteous dame you serve; do me the favour [Speaking in a lower voice, and leading her aside. To tell the noble mistress of this castle That one, devoted dearly to her service, Who breathes the air in which she breathes, as gales Wafted from Paradise, begs in her presence With all devotion to present himself. Soph. in a loud voice). The Marquis of Tortona, as I guess. Tor. The same; and let not in your peaceful halls Our warlike mien alarm you. In the field Whate'er our power may be, forget it here. Within her precincts, Mars himself would doff His nodding helm, and bend in meek submission. Soph. True, valiant lord; the brave are ever gentle In hall and bower. But think not warlike guise Will so alarm us now: there are within Whose nodding plumes, indeed, less downy are, Whose well-hack'd armour wears a dimmer hue, Who have already taught our timid eyes To look more boldly on such awful things. Tor. How, those within? What meanst thou? Soph. Ha, my lord! You come not then to wish the gentle countess Joy of her lord's return. Tor. Is he return'd? It surely cannot be. Soph. He is, in truth. This morning he arrived With many valiant soldiers from the wars, Where they have seen rough service. Tor. That war so quickly ended? Soph. Yes, my lord, And fortunately too. The Moors submit To the victorious arms of noble Garcio; Who, ere he left their coast, did for his prince A happy peace conclude. Will it not please you To enter, then, and bid him welcome home? Tor. I should indeed,âbut 'twill intrude upon him. He and his lady may, perhaps, desire Some hours of privacy.âOblige me, then, And offer my respectâcongratulationâ I do but ill express the joy I feel. I will no longer trespass. [Hurrying away, and then returning. 'Tis delicacy makes me thus in haste, As thou wilt comprehend. Should time permit, Though much I fear to-morrow's sun will light us To other scenes, I will return and pay To the most noble count all courtesy. Fair maiden, fare thee well! [Hurrying away, and returning again; then drawing her further aside and speaking softly in her ear. The count, as I am told, dislikes this castle: His stay, perhaps, may be of short duration? Soph. Belike it may. Tor. Though quitting this vicinity, My station for a time will not be distant. Couldst thou in such a case indite to me A little note of favour? Taking her hand.) Pretty hand! A billet penn'd by thee must needs contain Words of sweet import.âFingers light and slender! Offering to put on a ring.) Let this be favour'd. Soph. Nay, my lord, excuse me. The pen these fingers use indites no billets Of such sweet import as you fondly guess: A housewife's recipe, or homely letter Of kind inquiry to some absent friend, Exhausts its power. Unskill'd to earn such gifts, I may not wear them.âYonder comes Rovani, A noble soldier; stay and learn from him The story of the war. Word-bound he is not: He'll tell it willingly. [Rovani, who has appeared at the gate, during the latter part of their discourse, observing them suspiciously, now comes forward. Tor. No, no! I am in haste, farewell, farewell! [Exit with his followers. Lud. He goes, I trow, less grandly than he came. Gau. Such hasty steps, indeed, somewhat derange The order of his high nobility. Lud. Yet, pompous as he is, I have been told He is no coward. Gau. I suspect him much. Lud. But thou art wrong: although he doth assume Those foolish airs of martial gallantry, He is as brave as others. Rov. who has placed himself directly in front of Sophera, and has been looking for some time significantly in her face). So, gentle maid, your martial visitor Retreats right speedily. How fortunate, To meet so opportunely at the gate A prudent friend, to tell him what, perhaps, May save his bones, although it damp his pleasure! Nay, smile not: I commend thee in good earnest. Thou art a prudent maid, endow'd with virtues That suit thy station. This is ample praise. Soph. Ample; and spoken too with meaning tones. What face is this thou wearst of sly significance? Go to! thou dup'st thyself with too much shrewdness; And canst not see what plainly lies before thee, Because thou aimst at seeing more. I'll in, And bear Tortona's greeting to my lord And to his countess. Rov. Do; and give it allâ The message and its postscript: words of audience, And those of gentle whisper following after. Let nothing be forgotten. Soph. Nothing shall. Good day, and heaven curtail thee of thy wits To make thee wiser! [Exit into the gate, and followed by Ludovico, &amp;c. &amp;c. Rov. alone). Ay, ay! a very woman! pleased and flatter'd With the stale flatt'ry of a practised coxcomb, Though plainly sueing for another's favour. A very, very woman!âAs I guess'd, Some secret intercourse hath been in train, Although how far in blameful act advanced I know not.âNow, 'tis cross'd and interrupted. So will I e'en believe, and fret no more. What good have I in living free from wedlock, If I for husband's honour thus take thought? Better it were to wear the horns myself, Knowing it not, than fret for other men. [Exit. ACT III. SCENE I. An apartment in the castle. Enter Garcio and Ludovico, speaking as they enter. Gar. Ha! with a priest! conferring with a priest! Have they been long together? Lud. Full an hour. Gar. And does she oft such ghostly counsel take? Has she of late? Lud. My lord? Gar. O, nothing! nothing! Stare not as if I meant to question thee: I had no more to say. [Motioning him away. [Exit Ludovico. Alone.) At such a time retired with her confessor! What! hath her lord's return caused in her mind Such sudden need of ghostly counsel?âStrange! Something hath been amiss: if not in act, She is, I fear, in will and fancy tainted. Rovani enters behind him unperceived. Rov. Nay, pure or tainted, leave the fancy free. Of her concerns who may cognizance take? Although cowl'd priests beneath their jurisdiction Pretend to hold her, be not thou so strict. Gar. Thou knowst, then, that my wife is with her priest. Rov. I knew it not.âShe is a pious dame: She seemsâshe is a very pious dame. Gar. Nay, speak thy mind! thou needst not hesitate. We have been fellow-soldiers nine long years: Thou ne'er wast wont to weigh thy words with me. What dost thou think? There is some cause for this. Rov. Women are full of strange and fitful humours. Gar. Not so; it is not that.âYet, were she false, Methinks her shame-flush'd face would turn aside, Nor look on me so oft and earnestly As I have seen her gaze.âIt cannot be! In act she is not false.âBut if her heart, Where every kind and dear affection dwelt,â If it be changedâstamping on the ground) Some fiend hath been at work,â Some cursed agent hath been tamp'ring with her. [Pacing to and fro in violent agitation. Rov. Be not so wretched for a doubtful ill, Which, if it be at allâ Gar. A doubtful ill! Oh, if my head but ached, or fev'rish sleep, Or the more potent secret cause forced from me One groan or sigh, what tones of kind alarm! And the soft pressure of her gentle hand In mute affliction, till I smiled again! Here, on my bursting heart I feel it still, Though cold and changed she be. After a gloomy pause.) Perhaps some awful and mysterious power Within these fated precincts doth for me Love to aversion turn. Rov. What dost thou mean by a mysterious power? And but e'en now methought I heard thee name A potent secret cause.âThou hast been wont Freely to make me sharer of thy thoughtsâ Of all thy secret wishes. Gar. So I have: Nought for thy good to hear or mine to utter, Have I conceal'd from thee.âI hear a noise. Rov. No; I hear nothing. Gar. But my ear is quick;â Too quick, perhaps, in fancying sounds that are not. Rov. Ay, thou art right: Sophera moved the latch. Enter Sophera. Gar. to Sophera). Com'st thou to tell me that the priest is gone? Soph. The countess did command me to inform you She is not well, and begs that for the night She may in solitude recruit her spirits. She wishes you good night and peaceful sleep. She bade me say, my lord, her malady Is of no ardent kind that should alarm you; But, as she hopes, will pass away ere morn. Aside to Rovani, while Garcio turns away in silence.) He takes it deeply. Rov. aside to her). No, faith! a soldier is too well inured To disappointment; knowing not at daybreak Whether his next night's slumber shall be had On silken couch, by some fair princess fann'd, Or on the cold damp earth, with dead men's bones His wounded head to pillow. No, sweet maid! We bear such evils lightly. Soph. 'Tis well ye do; and so, brave sir, good night! [Exit. Gar. returning to Rovani). What thinkst thou of this message? Rov. I know not what to think. Gar. Thou dost! thou dost! for in thine eyes I read A shameful thought, that must remain unutter'd. Ruin, and shame, and misery come upon me! Heav'n pours its vengeance on this cursed head! Rov. Nay, do not thus give way: be well assured Ere thou give loose to passion. Gar. Assured! and how assured? What can I do?â Become a calm inquisitor of shame? Rov. Restrain thyself, and go to thine apartment, As if to pass the night. But, some hours later, When all are gone to rest, steal softly forth Into thy lady's chamber. There thou'lt see If she indeed be sick, or if she hold The vigil of a guilt-distracted mind. Gar. I like thy counsel well: I'll to my chamber. Good night, my friend. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The bedchamber of the Countess, who is discovered sitting on a low seat by the side of the bed, with her head and arms thrown upon the bed. She raises her head, and, after a thoughtful pause, starts up eagerly. Countess. It cannot be! The roused and angry deep Lashes its foaming billows o'er the bark That bears th' accursed freight, till the scared crew Into its yawning gulf cast forth the murderer. On the embattled field, in armour cased, His manly strength to blasted weakness turns. Yea, in their peaceful homes, men, as by instinct, From the dark rolling of his eye will turn They know not why, so legibly has Nature Set on his brow the mark of bloody Cain. And shall I think the prosp'rous Garcio,âhe Whose countenance allured all eyes, whose smiles, Whose voice was love, whose frame with strong affection I've seen so dearly moved; who in my arms, Who in my heart hath livedâNo! let dark priests, From the wild fancies of a dying man, Accuse him as they will, I'll not believe it. After another pause.) Would in this better faith my mind had strength To hold itself unshaken! Doubt is misery. I'll go to him myself and tell my wretchedness. O! if his kindling eye with generous ire Repel the charge;âif his blest voice deny it, Though one raised from the dead swore to its truth, I'll not believe it. Enter Sophera. What brings thee here again? Did I not charge thee To go to bed? Soph. And so I did intend. But in my chamber, half prepared for rest, Op'ning the drawer of an ancient cabinet To lay some baubles by, I found withinâ Countess. What hast thou found? Soph. Have I not heard you say, that shortly after Your marriage with the count, from your apartment, A picture of your brother, clad in mail, A strong resemblance, over which your tears Had oft been shed, was stol'n away? Countess. Thou hast. How it was stol'n, for value it had none For any but myself, I often wonder'd. Thou hast not found it? Soph. See! this I have found. [Giving her a picture, which she seizes eagerly. Countess. Indeed, indeed it is! [After gazing mournfully on it. Retire, I pray thee, nor, till morning break, Return again, for I must be alone. [Exit Sophera. (After gazing again on the picture.) Alas! that lip, that eye, that arching brow; That thoughtful look which I have often mark'd, So like my noble father! [Kissing it. This for his dear, dear sake, and this for thine: Ye sleep i' the dust together.â Alas! how sweetly mantled thus thy cheek At sight of those thou lovedst!âWhat things have been What hours, what years of trouble have gone by, Since thus in happy careless youth thou wast Dearest and nearest to my simple heart. [Kisses it again, and presses it to her breast, while Garcio, who has entered behind by a concealed door at the bottom of the stage, comes silently upon her, and she utters a scream of surprise. Gar. This is thy rest, then, and the quiet sleep That should restore thy health: thou giv'st these hours To the caressing of a minion's image Which to a faithful husband are denied. Oh, oh! they but on morning vapour tread, Who ground their happiness on woman's faith. Some reptile too! [Stamping on the ground. A paltry, worthless minion! Countess. Ha! was it jealousy so much disturb'd thee? If this be so, we shall be happy still. The love I bear the dead, dear though it be, Surely does thee no wrong. Gar. No, artful woman! give it to my hand. [Snatching at the picture. That is the image of a living gallant. Countess. O would it were! [Gives it to him, and he, starting as he looks upon it, staggers back some paces, till he is arrested by the pillar of the bed, against which he leans in a kind of stupor, letting the picture fall from his hands. Merciful God! he's guilty!âam I thus? Heav'n lend me strength! I'll be in doubt no longer. [Running up to him, and clasping her hands together. Garcio, a fearful thing is in my mind, And curse me not that I have harbour'd it, If that it be not so.âThe wretched Baldwin, Upon his death-bed, in his frenzied ravings, Accused thee as the murderer of my brother: O pardon me that such a monstrous tale Had any power to move me!âLook upon me! Say that thou didst it not, and I'll believe thee. [A pause. Thou dost not speak. What fearful look is that? That blanching cheek! that quiv'ring lip!âO horrible! [Catching hold of his clothes. Open thy lips! relieve me from this misery! Say that thou didst not do it. [He remains silent, making a rueful motion of the head. O God! thou didst, thou didst! [Holds up her hands to heaven in despair, and then, recoiling from him to a distant part of the chamber, stands gazing on him with horror. Garcio, after great agitation, begins to approach her irresolutely. I've shared thy love, been in thy bosom cherish'd, But come not near me! touch me not! the earth Yawning beneath my feet will shelter me From thine accursed hand. Gar. O Margaret! Can gentlest love to such fierce detestation Be in an instant changed, for one sad deed, The hasty act of a most horrid moment, When hell and strong temptation master'd me? And yet why marvel? for thou canst not more Detest that deed than I, the wretched doer. Countess. Ah, ah! why didst thou? Gar. Listen to my story. But, oh! the while, unfasten from my face Those looks of horror, else I cannot tell it. Countess. Speak then, I hear thee. Gar. Thou knowst too well with what fierce pride Ulrico Refused, on thy behalf, my suit of love; Deeming a soldier, though of noble birth, E'en his own blood, possessing but his arms And some slight wreaths of fame, a match unmeet For one whom lords of princely territory Did strive to gain:âand here, indeed, I own He rightly deem'd; my suit was most presumptuous. Countess. Well, pass this o'er;âI know with too much pride He did oppose thy suit. Gar. That night! It was in dreary, dull November, When at the close of day, with faithful Baldwin, I reach'd this castle with the vain intent To make a last attempt to move his pity. I made it, and I fail'd. With much contempt And aggravating passion, he dismiss'd me To the dark night. Countess. You left him then? You left him? Gar. O yes! I left him. In my swelling breast My proud blood boil'd. Through the wild wood I took My darkling way. A violent storm arose; The black dense clouds pour'd down their torrents on me; The roaring winds aloft with the vex'd trees Held strong contention, whilst my buffeted breast The crushing tangled boughs and torn-up shrubs Vainly opposed. Cross lay the wild'ring paths. I miss'd the road; and after many turnings, Seeing between the trees a steady light, As from a window gleam, I hasten'd to it. It was a lower window, and within, The lighted chamber showed me but too well, We had unwittingly a circuit made Back to the very walls from whence we came. Countess. Ah, fated, fatal error! most perverse! Gar. But, oh! what feelings, thinkst thou, rose within me? What thoughts, what urging thoughts, what keen suggestions Crowded upon me like a band of fiends, When, on a nearer view, within the chamber, Upon an open couch, alone and sleeping, I saw Ulrico? Countess. Didst thou slay him sleeping? The horrible deed!âThou couldst not! O thou couldst not! Gar. Well mayst thou say it! I've become, sweet Margaret, Living, though most unworthy as I was, Companion of thy virtues, one, whose heart Has been to good affections form'd and bent; But then it was not so.âMy hapless youth In bloody, savage, predatory war Was rear'd. It was no shock to my rude childhood To see whole bands of drunk or sleeping men In cold blood butcher'd. Could I tell to thee The things that I have seen: things, too, in which My young hand took its part; thou wouldst not wonder, That, seeing thus my enemy in my power, Love, fortune, honours, all within the purchase Of one fell stroke, I raised my arm and gave it. Countess. Fearful temptation! Gar. After a fearful pause, I softly enter'd. The deed was done; and, hastening from the chamber With breathless speed back to the spot where Baldwin Held my brave steed, I mounted, favour'd now By a new-risen moon and waning storm; And to the fleetness of that noble creature I owe it, that though heir to him I slew, No whisper of suspicion upon me E'er breathed as perpetrator of the deed. Countess. And I have been the while thy bosom's mate, Pressing in plighted love the bloody hand That slew my brother! Gar. Thou, indeed, hast been An angel pure, link'd to a fiend. Yet, think not I have enjoy'd what guilt so deep had earn'd. Oh no! I've borne about, where'er I went, A secret wretchedness within my breast Turning delight to torment. Now thou knowest Why on my midnight couch thou'st heard me oft Utter deep groans, when thou, waked from thy sleep, Hast thought some nightmare press'd me. Oh! were the deed undone, not all the diff'rence Of sublunary bliss that lies between A world's proud monarch and the loathliest wretch That gleans subsistence from the fetid dunghill, Would tempt me to embrue my hands in murder. [Speaking these last words loudly and vehemently. Countess. Hush! speak not thus! thou'lt be o'erheard: some list'ner Is at the door. I thought I heard a noise. [Going to the door, opening it, then shutting it softly and returning. No; there is nothing: 'twas my fears deceived me. Gar. And dost thou fear for me? Are there within thee Still some remains of love for one so guilty? Thou wilt not then, in utter detestation, Heap curses on my head. Countess. Guilty as thou hast been, I cannot curse thee. O no! I'll nightly from my cloister'd cell Send up to pitying heaven my prayers for thee. Gar. Thy cloister'd cell! What mean those threat'ning words? Countess. Garcio, we must part. Gar. No; never! Any punishment but this! We shall not part. Countess. We must, we must! 'Twere monstrous, 'twere unholy Longer to live with thee. Gar. No, Margaret, no! Thinkst thou I will indeed Submit to this, e'en cursed as I am? No; were I black as hell's black fiends, and thou Pure as celestial spirits (and so thou art), Still thou art mine; my sworn, my wedded love, And still as such I'll hold thee. Countess. Heav'n bids us part: yea, nature bids us part. Gar. Heav'n bids us part! Then let it send its lightning To strike me from thy side. Let yawning earth, Op'ning beneath my feet, divide us. Then, And not till then, will I from thee be sever'd. Countess. Let go thy terrible grasp: thou wouldst not o'er me A dreaded tyrant rule? Beneath thy power Thou mayst indeed retain me, crush'd, degraded, Watching in secret horror every glance Of thy perturbed eye, like a quell'd slave, If this suffice thee; but each tie of loveâ All sympathy between us now is broken And lost for ever. Gar. And canst thou be so ruthless? No, thou canst not! Let heav'n in its just vengeance deal with me! Let pain, remorse, disease, and every ill Here in this world of nature be my portion! And in the world of spirits too well I know The murd'rer's doom abides me. Is this too little for thy cruelty? No; by the living God! on my curst head Light every ill but this! We shall not part. Countess. Let go thy desp'rate hold, thou desp'rate man! Thou dost constrain me to an oath as dreadful; And by that awful nameâ Gar. Forbear, forbear! Then it must be; there is no mitigation. [Throws himself on the ground, uttering a deep groan, when Rovani and Sophera burst in upon them from opposite sides. Rov. (to the Countess). What is the matter? Hath he on himself Done some rash act? I heard him loud and stormy. Soph. She cannot answer thee: look to the count, And I will place her gently on her couch; For they are both most wretched. [Sophera supports the Countess, while Rovani endeavours to raise Garcio from the ground, and the scene closes. SCENE III. The inside of a rustic hermitage; the hermit discovered marking a figure on the wall. Hermit. This day to all the lonely days here spent; Making a term of thirty years' repentance For forty years of sin. Heav'n of its mercy Accept the sacrifice! Who knocks without? [Knocking at the door. 'Tis nothing but my fancy. Break of day Yet scarcely peeps, nor hath a new-waked bird Chirp'd on my branchy roof. [Knocking again. Nay, something does. Lift up the latch, whoe'er thou art; nor lock Nor bar, nor any hind'rance e'er prevents Those who would enter here. Enter Rovani. Rov. O pardon, holy hermit, this intrusion At such untimely hour; for misery Makes free with times and seasons. Hermit. Thou sayest well: it will doff ceremony E'en in a monarch's court. Sit down, I pray: I am myself a poor repentant sinner, But, as I trust, a brand saved from the fire. Then tell thy tale, and give thy sorrows vent: What can I do for myself entreat thy pity Rov. I do not for myself entreat thy pity But I am come from an unhappy man, Who, inly torn with agony of mind, Hath need of ghostly aid. Hermit. I am no priest. Rov. I know thou art not, but far better, father, For that which I entreat thee: The cowled monk, in peaceful cloisters bred, Who hath for half a cent'ry undisturb'd Told o'er his beads; what sympathy hath he For perturb'd souls, storm-toss'd i' the wicked world? Therefore Count Garcio most desires to see thee, And will to thee alone unlock his breast. Hermit. Garcio, the lord of this domain? Rov. The same. Hermit. The blest in love, the rich, the prosp'rous Garcio? Rov. He hath since dead of night traversed his chamber Like one distraught, or cast him on the ground In all the frantic violence of despair. I have watch'd by him, but from thee alone He will hear words of counsel or of peace. Thy voice, perhaps, will calm a stormy spirit That ne'er has known control. Hermit. God grant it may! We'll lose no time, my son; I follow thee. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. An ante-room; Rovani discovered pacing to and fro. Rov. Their conference is long. The gentle hermit Has had, I fear, no easy task.âHe comes! Enter Hermit. Save thee, good father! hath thy shriving sped? How is thy penitent? Hermit. Better, I hope: may heav'n preserve his mind In the meek frame in which I left it! Never, In all my intercourse with wretched sinners, Have I with a more keen ungovern'd spirit Stronger contention held. Rov. I well believe thee: For I have seen ere now his spirit strive In all the restless energy of passion. Thou hast at last subdued him? Hermit. Thank God, I have! Meek and resign'd to heav'n He now appears. But go to him, my son; He needs thy presence much. Within an hour He leaves the castle,âleaves his wife and child; It is not fit that he should be alone. Go, good Rovani, and with soothing words Keep thou his resolution to the bent. Rov. Ah! such a resolution! Heard I right? To leave his wife and child? Hermit. Question me not, my son; there is good cause: 'Tis meet that he should go. Rov. Forgive me, father! That solemn voice and sorrowing eye too well Asserts there is a cause,âa fearful cause. I will obey thee. [Going, but returns again. Is there aught further thou wouldst have me do? Hermit. He will, perhaps, desire to see his lady; But till he be prepared to leave the castle, And take his last farewell, methinks 'twere better They should not meet. Rov. I understand you, father. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The apartment of the Countess, who is discovered sitting on a low seat, her elbows resting on her lap, and her face covered with her clasped hands. She raises her head suddenly, listens for a moment, and then springs from her seat. Countess. I am not now deceived. [Goes to the door and listens, then returns. I heard his steps,â Yea, and his voice,âand it was nothing. Ah! My mind and senses so confused are grown, That all this wretchedness seems like a dream; A dream, alas! from which there is no waking. I hear him now: it is a distant step: I may be yet deceived. [Going near the door, and listening again. It is, it is! Heav'n give me strength! my trial is at hand! Enter Garcio, who approaches her, and then stopping short, gazes at her sadly, while she stands with her eyes fixed on the ground. Gar. Marg'ret, I thoughtâI hopedâI hopedâI was persuaded The farewell yearnings of a broken heart Would move thee to some pity of my state; But that averted face, that downcast eye,â There is abhorrence in it. Countess. O no! I fear'd to look; 'tis not abhorrence. [Raises her eyes to him, and shrinks back. Gar. What moves thee thus? Countess. Alas! thou'rt greatly alter'd: So pale thy cheek, thine eyes so quench'd and sunk! Hath one short night so changed thee? Gar. A night spent in the tossings of despair, When the fierce turmoil of contending passions To deepest self-abasement and contrition, Sabside;âa night in which I have consented To tear my bosom upâto rend in twain Its dearest, only tiesâay, such a night Works on the mortal frame the scath of years. Countess. Alas! thy frame will feel, I fear, too soon The scath of years. Sorrow and sickness then Will bow thee down, while cold unkindly strangers Neglect thy couch, nor give thee needful succour. Gar. And wherefore grieve for this? So much the better: They least befriend the wretched who retard The hour of his relcase.âWhy should I live If heav'n accept my penitence? Hath earth Aught still to raise a wish, or gleam the path Of one so darken'd round with misery? Countess. Nay, say not so: thy child, thy boy, to see him In strength and stature grown,âwould not this tempt thee To wish some years of life? Gar. Others shall rear him; others mark his change From the sweet cherub to the playful boy; Shall, with such pity as an orphan claims, Share in his harmless sports and catch his love; While I, if that I live and am by heav'n Permitted, coming as a way-worn stranger, At distant intervals, to gaze upon him, And strain him to my heart, shall from his eye The cold and cheerless stare of wonderment Instead of love receive. Countess. O think not so! he shall be taught to love thee; He shall be taught to lisp thy name, and raise His little hands to heav'n for blessings on thee As one most dear, though absent. Gar. I do believe that thou wilt teach him so. I know that in my lonely state of penitence, Sever'd from earthly bliss, I to thy mind Shall be like one whom death hath purified. O that, indeed, or death or any suff'rings, By earthly frame or frameless spirit endured, Could give me such a nature as again Might be with thine united! Could I but forward look and trust to this, Whatever suff'rings of a lengthen'd life Before me lay, would be to me as nothing; As the rough billows of some stormy frith, Upon whose further shore fair regions smile; As the rent shroudings of a murky cloud, Through which the mountain traveller, as he bends His mantled shoulders to the pelting storm, Sees sunny brightness peer. Could I but thinkâ Countess. Think it! believe it! with a rooted faith, Trust to it surely. Deep as thy repentance, Aspiring be thy faith! Gar. Ay, were my faith Strong as my penitence, 'twere well indeed. My scourge and bed of earth would then be temper'd Almost to happiness. Countess. Thy scourge and bed of earth! alas, alas! And meanst thou then to wreak upon thyself Such cruel punishment? O no, my Garcio! God doth accept the sorrow of the heart Before all studied penance. 'Tis not well: Where'er thou art, live thou with worthy men, And as becomes thy state. Gar. No; when from hence a banish'd man I go; I'll leave behind me all my crime did purchase. Deprived of thee, its first and dearest meed, Shall I retain its base and paltry earnings To live with strangers more regarded? No; Poor as I was when first my luckless steps This fatal threshold pass'd,âI will depart. Countess. And wilt thou then a houseless wand'rer be? Shall I, in warm robe wrapp'd, by winter fire List to the pelting blast, and think the while Of thy unshelter'd head?â Or eat my bread in peace, and think that Garcioâ Reduce me not to such keen misery. [Bursting into an agony of tears. Gar. And dost thou still feel so much pity for me? Retain I yet some portion of thy love? O, if I do! I am not yet abandon'd To utter reprobation. [Falling at her feet, and embracing her knees. Margaret! wife! May I still call thee by that name so dear? Countess (disentangling herself from his hold, and removing to some distance). O, leave me, leave me! for heav'n's mercy leave me! Gar. following her, and bending one knee to the ground). Marg'ret, beloved wife! keenly beloved! Countess. Oh, move me not! forbear, forbear in pity! Fearful, and horrible, and dear thou art! Both heaven and hell are in thee! Leave me then,â Leave me to do that which is right and holy. Gar. Yes, what is right and holy thou shalt do; Stain'd as I am with blood,âwith kindred blood, How could I live with thee? O do not think I basely seek to move thee from thy purpose. O, no! Farewell, most dear and honoured Marg'ret! Yet, ere I go, couldst thou without abhorrenceâ [Pauses. Countess. What wouldst thou, Garcio? Gar. If but that hand beloved were to my lips Once more in parting press'd, methinks I'd go With lighten'd misery.âAlas! thou canst not! Thou canst not to such guiltâ Countess. I can! I will! And heaven in mercy pardon me this sin, If sin it be. [Embraces him, and after weeping on his neck, breaks suddenly away and exit, while Garcio stands gazing after her. Gar. Have I not seen my last?âI've seen my last. Then wherefore wait I here?â The world before me lies.âa desert world, In which a banish'd wand'rer I must be. [A pause. Wander from hence, and leave her so defenceless In these unruly times! I cannot do it! I'll seem to go, yet hover near her still, Like spell-bound spirit near th' embalmed dust It can no more reanimate. Mine eyes May see her distant form, mine ears may hear Her sweet voice through the air, while she believes Kingdoms or seas divide us. The hermit is my friend, to him I'll go. Rest for the present, eager crowding thoughts! I must not linger here. [Exit. SCENE III. An outer court of the castle; an arched gateway in front with a stone bench on one side of it. Enter Ludovico, Gauvino, and Pietro, and seat themselves on the bench. Gau. The ev'ning breeze will cool us better here. Lud. After the sultry day it is refreshing. Pie. (to Gauvino). Well, as I was a-saying to the seneschal, I wonder that the count should think of choosing That noodle Gomez to attend upon him. Gau. He has some reason for it, be assured Lud. How so, good chamberlain? Gau. Heaven knows! but this fantastical Rovani, Whom as his deputy he leaves behind, Already takes upon him, by my faith! As if his kingdom were to last for ever. Lud. Thou speakst in spleen; he seems to me right gracious. Gau. I say not in the way of tyranny He takes upon him; 'tis his very graciousness, His condescending vanity I hate. A vain, assuming coxcomb! E'en when Garcio Frown'd like a master o'er us, yet my heart Acknowledged him as such, and loved him oft The better for his sternness. Lud. Didst thou? I'm sure full many a time and oft Thou'st grumbled like a fiend, whene'er his orders, Too roughly given, have cross'd thy wiser will. Gau. Well, well; perhaps I have! yet, ne'ertheless, Would he were with us still! Pie. Ay, would he were! Lud. Perhaps he'll soon return. Gau. (significantly). He'll ne'er return.âWe'll see him here no more. Lud. Why sayst thou so? Gau. I have my reasons: he hath been too prosperous. Pie. And what of that? Gau. The power that has upheld him, Will, when his term is up, dire reck'ning take. Pie. What dost thou mean? Gau. Nay, if thou canst not guess, I will not utter more. Lud. Ha! yonder Gomez comes! Pie. Gomez, indeed! [All rising to meet him. Lud. His lord is then return'd. Enter Gomez. Omnes. Return'd already, man! Where is thy master? Lud. Is he not with thee? Gomez. I would he were. I left him some leagues hence; By his command charged to return again, And follow him no more. Long I entreated To be permitted still to share his fate, But was at last constrain'd to leave him. Gau. Ha! Constrain'd! 'tis very strange. Where didst thou leave him? Gomez. In the dark centre of a gloomy forest, Dismounting, to my care he gave his steed, And, as I said before, so strictly charged me, I was constrain'd to leave him. Gau. A dark forest? Lud. Sawst thou where he went? Gomez. He turn'd away, and I with heavy cheerâ Gau. (very eagerly). Didst thou not look behind thee in retreating To see what path he took? Gomez. I look'd behind, But in a moment lost him from my sight. Gau. (shaking his head). 'Tis marvellous strange! Was there nor pit, nor cave, nor flood at hand? Gomez. Not that I noticed. Why dost shake thy head? Gau. He'll never more upon this earth be seen. Whether or cave, or gulf, or flood received him, He is, ere this, I fear, beneath the earth Full deep enough, reck'ning with him who bought him. Pie. Reck'ning with him who bought him! Be there then Such fearful compacts with the wicked power? Gau. Have ye not heard of John the Prosperous, Who, starting at the sound of piping winds, That burst his chamber door, full sore aghast, With trembling steps his gorgeous chamber left, And, by himself in a small boat embark'd, Steering his way to the black wheeling eddy In centre of the lake, which swallow'd him? Pie. My flesh creeps at the thought? Gomez. Dost thou believe it? Gau. Ay; or what think ye of the Count Avergo, Who, after years of such successful crimes, Took leave of all his friends, at warning given By sound of midnight trumpet at his gate; Round which, 'tis said, a band of plumed spectres, Whose whiten'd bony jaws and eyeless sockets Did from their open'd beavers to the moon Stare horribly, stood ready to receive him? Omnes. And went he with them? Gau. Ay, certes, did he! for above the ground With mortal men he never more was seen. (To Gomez.) But enter, man, and have a stoup of wine; Thou seemest faint and spent. Omnes. Ay, give him wine, for see how pale he is. Pie. Like one who hath been near unearthly things. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The garden. Enter the Countess and Sophera. Soph. (speaking as they enter). And look, I pray, how sweet and fresh and fragrant The dewy morning is. There, o'er our heads The birds conven'd like busy gossips sit, Trimming their speckled feathers. In the thick And tufted herbage, with a humming noise Stirs many a new-waked thing; among the grass Beetles, and lady-birds, and lizards glide, Showing their shining coats like tinted gold. Countess. Yes, all things, in a sunny morn like this, That social being have and fellowship With others of their kind, begin the day Gladly and actively. Ah! how wakes he, His day of lonesome silence to begin, Who, of all social intercourse bereft, On the cold earth hath pass'd the dismal night? Cheerful domestic stir, nor crowing cock, Nor greeting friend, nor fawning dog hath he To give him his good-morrow. Soph. Nay, do not let your fancy brood on this. Think not my lord, though he with Gomez parted In a lone wood, will wander o'er the earth In dreary solitude. In every country Kind hearts are found to cheer the stranger's way. Countess. Heaven grant he meet with such! Soph. Then be not so cast down. Last night the air Was still and pleasant; sweetly through the trees, Which moved not, look'd the stars and crescent moon: The night-bird's lengthen'd call with fitful lapse, And the soft ceaseless sound of distant rills Upon the list'ning ear came soothingly; While the cool freshness of the air was mix'd With rising odours from the flowery earth. In such sweet summer nights, be well assured The unhoused head sleeps soundest. Countess. The unhoused head! and Garcio's now is such! I could not sleep; and, as I paced my chamber, Alas! thought I, how long a term is night To lonely watchers! e'en a summer's night. And in the lengthen'd gloom of chill Decemberâ Why dost thou move? Soph. There is a stranger coming. Countess. Perhaps it is some message from my lord. Soph. I rather fear it is Tortona's lord. Countess. I wish my gate had not been open'd to him. Will he persist to press his presence on me? Enter Tortona. Tor. Pardon me, madam, this too bold intrusion, But hov'ring round your walls, like the poor moth Circling the fatal flame, I needs must enter. I was compell'd to do it. May I hope I see you well as lovely, and inclined, From the angelic sweetness of your nature, To pardon me? Countess. You still preserve, my lord, I do perceive, The bountiful profusion of a tongue Well stored with courteous words. Tor. Nay, rather say, A tongue that is of all expression beggar'd, That can the inward sentiments declare Which your angelic presence still inspires. (Pointing to Sophera.) This lady knows how deep, how true they are. She did refuse, yet, ne'ertheless, I trust She bore my secret message to your ear. Soph. 'Twas well for you I did not, good my lord; You had not else, I trow, found entrance here. Countess. It had, in truth, prevented this presumption. A secret message, saidst thou, for the ear Of Garcio's wife! Tor. And does the man who quits thee,â Like a dull dolt such heavenly beauty quits,â Deserve the name of husband? No, sweet Marg'ret; Gloze not to me thy secret wrongs: I know, Full well I know them; nor shall formal names And senseless ties my ardent love repel. [Catching hold of her hand. Countess (shaking him off). Base and audacious fool! did not thy folly Almost excuse thy crime, thou shouldst most dearly Repent this insult. Thinkest thou my lord Has left me unprotected?âHo! Rovani! Move with a quicker step. Enter Rovani, followed by Gonzalos. (To Tortona, pointing to Rovani.) Behold, my lord, the friend of absent Garcio, And in his absence holder of this castle. To his fair courtesy, as it is meet, I now consign you with all due respect; And so farewell. [Exit, followed by Sophera. Tor. I might, indeed, have known that modern dames An absent husband's substitute can find Right speedily. Rov. (aside to Gonzalos). Jealous of me, I hear. It makes my soldier's plume more proudly wave To think such fancies twitch him. [Aloud to Tortona, advancing to meet him. Noble marquis! Proud of the lady's honourable charge. That to my care entrusts a guest so valued, Let me entreat you to partake within Some slight refreshment. After such fatigue, So early and so gallantly encounter'd, (Two leagues at least upon an ambling steed Your morning's hardships fairly may be reckon'd,) You must require refreshment. Tor. Paltry coxcomb! Rov. Yes, paltry as a coxcomb. good my lord, Compared to greater. Pardon a deficiency Your presence has occasion'd, and permit That I conduct youâ Tor. Most contemptible! Follow me not! My way from this curst place I'll find without a guide. Rov. Then be it so. If it so please you: and, farewell, my lord, Until within these walls you shall again Vouchsafe to honour us. Tor. Which may be, jeering minion, somewhat sooner Than thou dost reckon for. Rov. Whene'er you will, we're ready to receive you. [Exit Tortona. He calls me minion: seest thou not, Gonzalos, Which way suspicion leans? The fool is jealous,â Jealous of me! Hath any one besides Harbour'd such foolish fancies? Gon. No, by St. Francis! ne'er a soul besides Hath such a thought conceived, or ever will. Rov. Thou'rt angry: dost thou think my thoughts are evil? Gon. No; evil thoughts thrive not within thy breast, Valiant Rovani; this I know right well: But vain ones there a fatt'ning culture find, And reach a marv'llous growth. Rov. Well, do not chide: I will with scrupulous honour Fulfil my trust; and do but wish my arms The lady and this castle might defend Against a worthier foe than that light braggart. Gon. But thou knowst well, or ought to know, Rovani, A braggart may be brave. Faith! were it not For some small grains of wit and honest worth Which poor Tortona lacks, thyself and he In natural temper'ment and spirit are So nearly match'd, you might twin nestlings be From the same shell.âBe not so rash, I pray! Tortona is no coward; and his forces Greater than thou in ruin'd walls like these Canst prudently oppose: therefore be wise, And send for timely aid, lest he surprise thee. Rov. I will be hang'd before another soldier Shall be admitted here. Gon. See to it then. Rov. And so I will; it is not thy concern. [Exit Gonzalos. Rov. (alone). He, too, 'tis manifest, has some suspicion That Marg'ret favours me. [Muttering, and smiling to himself, then speaking aloud. Ay, those same looks. Well, well, and if it be, It touches not our honour.âFair advice! Call in some neighbouring leader of banditti To share the honour of defending her! I know his spite. Twin nestlings from the shell With such a fool! I know his jealous spite. I will be hang'd before another soldier Shall cross the bridge or man our moated wall. [Exit. ACT V. SCENE I. The outer court of the castle. Hermit, pilgrim, and several mendicants, discovered standing round the gateway at the bottom of the stage. Enter, on the front, Ludovico, Gauvino, and Gomez. Gau. The rumour of our lady's bounteous alms Spreads o'er the country quickly; every morning Adds to the number of those mendicants,â Those slothful pests, who thus beset our gates. Lud. Rail not so bitterly; there are, thou seest, The sick and maim'd, and truly miserable, Although some idle vagrants with the crowd Have enter'd cunningly. Dost thou not see Our hermit is among them? Gau. What, comes he too a-begging? Shame upon him! His cot is stored with every dainty thing Our peasant housewives rear, poor simple souls! And prowls he here for more? Gomez. He never came before. Lud. Ay, and belike He rather comes to give than to receive. Gau. And what hath he to give? God mend thy wit! A broken rosary? Lud. A good man's blessing. Gau. Pooh, pooh! what folks are wont to sell at home, They will not go abroad to give for nothing. Gomez. And see yon aged pilgrim by his side, How spent and spare he seems! Gau. Hovels, and caves, and lazar-houses soon Will pour their pests upon us. Lud. Hush, man! thou art a surly heartless churl! Yonder the lady comes. Enter Countess.Mendicants (advancing, and all speaking at once as she enters). Blessings upon your head, most noble lady! Countess. I thank you all: have they been careful of you? Mendicants. Ay, bless you! they have served us bountifully. Countess. But wherefore stand ye here? Retire within, Where ye may sit at case and eat your morsel. Good pilgrim, thou art weary and lackst rest; I fear the hardships of thy wand'ring life Have blanch'd thy scanty locks more than thine years. Pilgrim. No, gentle lady: heav'n provides for me. When ev'ning closes, still some shelt'ring cave, Or peasant's cot, or goatherd's shed is near; And, should the night in desert parts o'ertake me, It pleases me to think the beating blast Has its commission, by rough discipline To profit me withal. Countess. The beating blasts have well fulfill'd on thee Their high commission. But, oh! exceed not! Wander forth no more. If thou hast home, or wife, or child, or aught Of human kind that loves thee, O return! Return to them, and end thy days in peace. Didst thou but know the misery of those Who hear the night-blast rock their walls, and think The head to them most dear may be unshelter'd, Thou couldst not be so cruelâ (Turning round.) Who twitch'd my robe? Lud. It was our holy hermit, Who press'd, e'en now, its border to his lips, Then shrank aside. Countess. But how is this? He hurries fast away. Lud. He is a bashful man, whose hooded face On woman never looks. Countess. Has he some vow upon him? Lud. 'Tis like he may; but he will pray for you. Countess. And good men's prayers prevail, I do believe. Lud. Ay, madam, all the peasants round, I trow, Set by his prayers great store. E'en mothers leave The very cradles of their dying infants To beg them. Wives, whose husbands are at sea, Or absent, or in any jeopardy, Hie to his cell to crave his intercession. Countess. Do they? Most blessed man! [Beckoning to the hermit, who stands aloof. I have words for thine ear; approach, I pray. [Leading him apart, on the front of the stage. The absent and in jeopardy by thee Remember'd are, and heav'n receives thy prayers: Then, oh! remember one, who for himself, Depress'd, discouraged, may not to God's throne Meet supplication make! [Taking him further apart, and in a lower voice. There is a lonely wand'rer in the world Of whom thou wottest. When the vespers sweet And ev'ning orisons of holy men Sound through the air, and in his humble cot, With all his family round, th' unlearn'd hind Lifts up his soul to heaven; when e'en the babe, Tutor'd to goodness, by its mother kneels To lisp some holy word,âon the cold ground, Unbleer'd of earthly thing, he'll lay him down Unblest, I fear, and silent. Such a one Thou wottest of, good father; pray for him. How's this? thou'rt greatly moved, and dost not answer. Have I requested what thou mayst not grant? Heav'n hath not cast him off. O do not think it! The heart that loved him hath not cast him off, And do not thou. Pray for him: God will hear thee. [He retires from her; she still following him. I do entreat, I do beseech thee, father! I saw thy big tears glancing as they fell, Though shrouded be thy face. Wilt thou not speak? Hermit (in a disguised voice). I will obey thee, lady. Countess (to herself). He hath a strange, mistuned, and hollow voice, For one of so much sympathy. [Alarm bell without. Ha! the alarm! What may it be? Ho! Pietro. Enter Pietro, in haste. Pie. Haste, shut the castle gates, and with all speed Muster our strength,âthere is no time to lose. Madam, give orders quickly. Where's Rovani? Countess. What is the matter? Why this loud alarm? Pie. The Marquis of Tortona, not far distant, With hasty march approaches, as I guess Three thousand strong. [Alarm rings again, and enter Rovani, Gonzalos, and others, from different sides. Countess. Heav'n be our trust! Hearest thou this, Rovani? Rov. I've heard the larum bell and strange confusion. Countess. Tortona with his hostile force approachesâ (To Pietro.) Tell it thyself; saidst thou three thousand strong? Pie. Yes, madam, so I did compute his numbers; And with him, too, one of those horrid engines So lately known, which from its roaring mouth Sends horrible destruction. Not two leagues off I met him in array Skirting the forest; and through dell and stream, Fast as my feet could bear me, I have run To give you notice. Countess. Heaven aid the weak! I fear our slender force Will be as nothing 'gainst such fearful odds. What thinkest thou, Rovani? for on thee Our fate depends. Rov. Fear not, my noble mistress! I will defend you. In your service bold, Each of your men will ten men's strength possess. Withdraw, then, I entreat you, to your tower, And these good folks dismiss. [Pointing to the mendicants that still remain. [Exeunt Countess and all the mendicants except the hermit, who retires to a corner of the stage. Gon. (advancing to Rovani on the front). Rovani, be thou bold, yet be not rash. I warn'd thee well of this; but let that pass: Only be wiser now. There is a leader Of bold condottieri, not far distant; Send to him instantly: there may be time. Rov. I will not: we can well defend these walls 'Gainst greater odds; and I could swear that coward Has number'd, in his fright, Tortona's soldiers Threefold beyond the truth. Go to thy duty: Muster the men within, while I, meantime, From place to place all needful orders give. [Exeunt Gonzalos and Rovani severally, while many people cross the stage in hurry and confusion, Rovani calling to them sometimes on one side, sometimes on another, as he goes off. Gomez (to Ludovico, following Rovani with his eye). A brave man this, and gives his orders promptly. Lud. Ay; brave enough, but rash. Alack the day! Would that our valiant lord were here himself, His own fair dame and castle to defend. Alas! that evil deed e'er stain'd his hand,â If this were so: we'll see his like no more. Hermit (going close to Ludovico). Fear not, good man, who lov'st thy hapless lord; Give me thine ear. [Whispers to him. Lud. (aside to hermit). Conceal thee in that tower! Hermit. Hush, hush! and come with me: I will convince thee That what I ask is for thy lady's good. [Exeunt, hermit leading off Ludovico from Gomez. SCENE II. The great hall of the castle. Enter the Countess, meeting Sophera; a confused noise heard without, and a discharge of cannon. Countess. What sawst thou from the turrets, for thy face Looks pale and terrified? The din increases; They have not made a breach? Soph. I hope they have not; but that fearful engine Is now against our weakest buttress pointed. [Cannon heard again. It roars again; have mercy on us, heaven! How the walls shake, as if an earthquake rock'd them! Countess. My child, my child! I'll to the lowest vaults Convey him instantly. Soph. But you forget th' attack is still directed Against the eastern side; here he is safe. Countess. And may th' Almighty ever keep him so! [Cannon without. Soph. Again the horrible roar! Countess. Our ruin'd walls are weak, our warriors few: Should they effect a breach!âO Garcio, Garcio! Where wand'rest thou, unblest, unhappy man, Who hadst our safeguard been! Enter Pietro. Ha! bringst thou tidings? Pie. Ay, and fearful tidings. The foe have made a breach, and through the moat, Now grown so shallow with the summer drought, Have made their way. Countess. Where does Rovani fight? Pie. He did fight in the breach most valiantly; But now the foemen o'er his body pass, For he is slain, and all, I fear, is lost. Countess. It must not be: I'll to the walls myself; My soldiers will with desperate courage fight, When they behold their wretched mistress near. Soph. (endeavouring to prevent her). O, madam, do not go! Alas, alas! our miserable fate! Countess. Restrain me not with senseless lamentations; Driven to this desp'rate state, what is my choice? For now I must be bold, or despicable. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The ramparts. Women discovered looking down from one of the lower battlements of the castle; the din and clashing of arms heard without, as if close at hand; then Tortona and his soldiers cross the stage, fighting with the soldiers of the castle. 1st woman. See, there! see how our noble lady stands, And bravely cheers them! 2d woman. If they have any soul or manhood in them, They'll fight like raging lions for her sake. Gon. (without). Fie, fie! give way before your lady's eyes! 1st woman. Ay, brave Gonzalos there right nobly strives; But all in vain,âthe enemy advance; They gain the pass, and our base varlets yield. (Voice without.) Bear in the lady there; 'tis desperation! (2d voice without.) Resistance now is vain; bear in the lady! (3d voice without.) A miracle! a miracle! 1st woman. What is't? Why call they out a miracle? 2d woman. Hast thou not eyes to see? Upon our side The hermit combats, coiling round one arm His twisted garments, whilst the other wields A monstrous brand, might grace a giant's grasp. O brave! look how he fights! he doth not fight Like mortal man: heav'n sends him to our aid. 1st woman. And see! there is another miracle! See Ludovico fighting by his side! Who could have thought our gentle seneschal Had pith and soul enough to fight so bravely? 2d woman. See, see! the vile Tortonians stand aghast: They turn, they fly! [Loud shouts heard without, and re-enter Tortona and his party, pursued by the soldiers of the castle, led on by the hermit. Hermit. Turn, valiant chieftain! the most gen'rous foe Of dames, whose lords are absent; turn, for shame! Do not disgrace thy noble enterprise With wounds received behind. Whate'er their cause, Tortona's lords have still been soldiers. Turn, Or be the scorn of every beardless boy, Whose heart beats at the sound of warlike coil. Thou canst not fear a man unhelm'd, unmail'd? Tor. No; if a man thou art, I fear thee not! Hermit. Well, to it, then, and prove me flesh and blood. Tor. Whate'er thou art, I'll bear thy scorn no longer. [Exeunt, fighting furiously. SCENE IV. The great hall: a shouting heard without. Enter Pietro, calling as he enters. Pie. Where is the countess? Enter Sophera, by the opposite side. Soph. Thy voice calls gladly; dost thou bring good tidings? Pie. I do; but stop me not! Where is the countess? Enter Countess in haste. Countess. What joyful shouts were those? My soldiers' voices! Some happy chance has changed the fate of battle. Pie. Ay, changed most happily. Countess. And heaven be praised! How has it been, good Pietro? Tell me quickly. Pie. When we were panic-strick'n, reft of our wits, Treading, like senseless sheep, each other down, Heav'n sent us aid. Countess. And be its goodness praised! So near the verge of merciless destruction, What blessed aid was sent? Pie. By our fierce enemy, as I have said, So sorely press'd, a powerful voice was heard Calling our courage back; and on the sudden, As if the yawning earth had sent it up, A noble form, clad in the hermit's weeds, But fighting with such fury irresistible As armed warrior, no, nor mortal man Did ever fight, upon our side appear'd, Inspiring us with valour. Instantly We turn'd again on our astonish'd foe, Who fled to gain the breach by which they enter'd. Few have escaped; and by our noble hermit Tortona's lord is slain. Countess (after looking up to heaven in silent adoration). That mighty Arm which still protects the innocent. Weak woman, helpless infancy, and all Bereft and desolate, hath fought for us! But he, the blessed agent of its power, Our brave deliv'rer, lead me to him instantly! Where is the marv'llous man? Pie. I left him, madam, on the eastern rampart, Just as Tortona fell.âSee Ludovico, Who still fought nearest to him; he'll inform you. Enter Ludovico. Countess. Brave Ludovico!âBut that woeful look, In such a moment of unhoped-for triumph! Is the brave being safe who hath preserved us? Lud. Alas! e'en as we shouted at the fall Of proud Tortona, conquer'd by his arm; E'en as he stoop'd to soothe his dying foe, The hateful caitiff drew a hidden dagger And plunged it in his breast. Countess. Alas, alas! and is his life the forfeit Of his most gen'rous aid! O lead me to him! let me thank and bless him, If yet his noble mind be sensible To words of gratitude. Lud. They bring him hither. He himself desired That they should bear him to your presence. See! With sad slow steps they come. Enter soldiers bearing the hermit on a low bier, and set him down near the front of the stage. The Countess stands in woeful silence till he is placed, and then throws herself at his feet, embracing them. Countess. Devoted, generous man! Heav'n's blessed minister! Who hast, to save us from impending ruin, Thy life so nobly sacrificed; receive,â While yet thy soul hath taste of earthly things,â Receive my thanks, my tears, my love, my blessing; The yearning admiration of a heart Most grateful! Generous man, whoe'er thou art, Thy deeds have made thee blood and kindred to me. O that my prayers and tears could move thy God, Who sent such aid, to spare thy precious life! Hermit (uncovering his head, and discovering the face of Garcio). Margaret! Countess. My Garcio! [Throwing her arms round him for some time, then raising herself from the bier, and wringing her hands in an agony of grief. This is my wretched work! Heaven was his judge, Yet I, with cruel unrelenting sternness, Have push'd him on his fate. O Garcio, Garcio! Gar. Do not upbraid thyself: thou hast done well: For no repentance e'er could make me worthy To live with thee, though it has made me worthy To die for thee. Countess. My dear and generous Garcio! Alas, alas! Gar. O calm that frantic grief! For had my life been spared, my dearest Margaret, A wand'ring banish'd wretch I must have been, Lonely and sad: but now, forgiven by thee,â For so my heart assures me that I am,â To breathe my parting spirit in thy presence, For one who has so heavily offended, Is a most happy end. It is so happy That I have faith to think my deep contrition Is by my God and Judge accepted now, Instead of years of wretchedness and penance. Be satisfied and cheer'd, my dearest wife! Heaven deals with me in mercy. Where is thy hand? Farewell, a long farewell! Soph. See, he revives, and strives to speak again. Gar. Could I but live till I have seen my child! It may not be: the gripe of death is here. Give him my dying love. [Dies. [Curtain drops. THE PHANTOM: A MUSICAL DRAMA, IN TWO ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Dunarden, Highland chief. Malcolm, his son. The Provost of Glasgow. Claude, his son. Crawford, friend of Claude. Graham. Allen, Culloch, and other Highlanders. Sexton, servants, and other inhabitants of Glasgow.WOMEN Alice, daughter of the Provost of Glasgow. Marian, daughter of Dunarden. Jessie, attending on Marian. Bride, bridemaids, housekeeper, &amp;c. Scene, in the Western Highlands of Scotland, and afterwards in the city of Glasgow. ACT I. SCENE I. A green lawn, surrounded with rocks, and mountains seen in the distance. An assembly of Highlanders are discovered, holding bridal revelry: bagpipes playing, and a noise of voices heard, as the curtain draws up. Enter Allen. 1st high. Welcome, brave Allen! we began to fear The water-kelpy, with her swathing arms, Had drown'd thee at the ford. 2d high. Faith did we, man! thee and thy shelty too. Allen. Am I so late? There's time enough, I hope, To foot a measure with the bonnie bride, And maidens too.â'Tis well I'm come at all: I met the ill-eyed carline on my way. 1st high. And suffer'd scath by her? Allen. Ay, scath enough: My shelty, in the twinkling of an eye, Became so restive, neither switch nor heel Could move him one step further. 2d high. And so you were obliged to come on foot. Allen. What could I do? It was not with the beast I held contention, but the evil spell Of that untoward witch.âAy, but for that, I would defy the wildest four-legg'd thing In all Lochaber so to master me! 1st high. Well, well; the pipes are playing merrily,â Make up lost time as fleetly as thou canst. Allen. And so I will; for here are rosy partners, Ribbon'd and cockernonied, by my faith! Like very queens. They make, here as I stand, Each garter'd leg to thrill, and toes to tickle. [Seizing one of a group of girls, advancing from the dancers at the bottom of the stage. Come, winsome Jean! I'll have a reel with thee. Look not so coy: where did I meet thee last? We have not had a merry-making here Since Duncan Mory's latewake. Jean. Say nought of latewakes here, I warn you well: Wot ye who is the bridesmaid? Allen. Some gentle dame, belike. Jean. Some gentle dame! Dumbarton Mary, with her Lowland airs. Allen. Ay! she that look'd so stern, and said it was A savage thing, or some such word as that, To dance at old Glenlyon's funeral.â But, could the laird himself have raised his head, He with his ivory stick had rapp'd her pate For marring with her mincing gentleness The decent bravery of his last rouse.â Come, let us have a merry reel together. [They mix with dancers, who now advance to the front, where a bumpkin, or dance of many interwoven reels, is performed; after which the bride is led to a seat, and some of her maidens sit by her. Bridegroom. Now, while the bride and bonnie maidens all Take needful rest, we'll pass the cheering cup. And, Rory of Glenoruch, clear thy throat, And sing some merry song, meet for a wedding, Where all are boon and gay. Bride. O, never mind for that! give us the song Which thou wast wont on Clachen braes to sing, And we to praise. Thou knowst the song I mean. Rory. On bridal day the bride must be obey'd: But 'tis a song devised for gentle-folks, Made by the youthful laird of Ballamorin, And not for common clansfolk like ourselves. Bride. But let us have it ne'ertheless, good Rory; It shows how sweetly thwarted lovers meet O' moonlight nights, and talk of happy times Which fortune has in store for faithful hearts: The silliest moorland herd can follow that. Rory. Then be it as you please: I'll do my best. SONG. I've seen the moon gleam through the cave, And minute drops like diamonds glancing; I've seen, upon a heaving wave, The tressy-headed mermaid dancing: But ne'er was seen, in summer night, Beneath the moon, in brightness riding, A moving thing, to charm the sight, Like Flora to her Malcolm gliding. I've heard a pibroch, through the wind, As absent chief his home was nearing; A half-stripp'd infant, sweetly kind, With mimic words its mother cheering: But ne'er were evening sounds so sweet, As, near the spot of promise stealing, The quick, soft tread of Flora's feet, Then whisper'd words, herself revealing. My boat I've fastened to the stake, And on the shelly beach am pacing, While she is passing moor and brake, On heather braes her shadow tracing; And here we'll pass a happy hour, For hours and years of bliss preparing, When we shall grace our girdled tower, Lands, life, and love, together sharing. Enter Culloch. Allen. Ha! our young chief must be return'd, for here Comes Culloch, with his staring freckled face. Omnes (gathering round Culloch). Well, man, what are thy news? where hast thou been? Cul. We've been at Glasgow. 1st high. Glasgow! Save us all! Allen (half aside to 1st high.). I doubt it not: his master, I hear say, Goes oftener there than his good father wots of; Ay, or his sister either. I suspect There is some dainty ladyâ 1st high. Hush! say nothing. Allen. And so, brave Culloch, thou hast travell'd far: And what is Glasgow like? Cul. Like all Drumleary craigs set up in rows, And chimneys smoking on the top of them. It is an awful sight! 1st high. And what sawst thou besides the craigs and chimneys? Cul. There be six kirks,âI told them on my fingers; And, rising from the slates of every kirk, There is a tower, where great bells ring so loud, That you might hear them, standing on this sward, Were they on great Benlawers. 1st high. Tut! tut! thy ears are better than thy wits. Bride. And sawst thou any silken ladies there, With all their bravery on? Cul. Ay, ladies, gentlemen, and red-coat soldiers, And plaided drovers, standing at the cross, As close as heather stalks on Hurroch moss. Ah! well I trow it is an awful place! Allen (aside as before). And well I trow the chief has business there He wishes no observer to discover, When he, of all the idle household loons, Took such an oaf as Culloch to attend him. But I'll e'en go, before he join the dance, And have a private word of him, to favour My poor old mother in her ruin'd cot. I know full well he will not say me nay, Though the old laird himself be cold and close. 1st high. Go, then, and speed thee well! [Exit Allen. Bridegroom. Hear, bonnie lassies! the young laird himself Will soon be here, and foot it with you featly. Old woman. O, bless his comely face! among you all There is not one that foots the floor like him,â With such a merry glee and manly grace! Bridegroom. We'll have no further dancing till he come. Meantime, good Rory, sing another song; Both bride and maidens like thy chanting well: And those who list may join the chorus rhyme. SONG. Upon her saddle's quilted seat, High sat the bonnie Lowland bride; Squires rode before, and maidens sweet Were gently ambling by her side. What makes her look so pale and wan?â She's parted from her Highlandman. What makes her look, &amp;c. Where'er they pass'd, at every door Stood maids and wives the sight to see; Curs bark'd, and bairnies by the score Ran bawling loud and merrily, But still the bride looks dull and wan; She's thinking of her Highlandman. But still the bride, &amp;c. The Lowland laird, in bridegroom's gear, Prick'd forth to meet the fair array; His eye was bright, his voice was clear, And every word was boon and gay. Ah! little did he reckon then Of bold and burly Highlandmen. Ah! little did he reckon, &amp;c. The bride she raised her drooping brow, And red as crimson turn'd her cheek.â What sound is that? The war-pipe now Descending from yon broomy peak. It sounds like marching of a clan; O can it be her Highlandman? It sounds like, &amp;c. Their bonnets deck'd with heather green, Their shoulders broad with tartans bound, Their checker'd hose were plainly seen Right fleetly moving to the sound. Quick beat her heart, within a ken, To see the valiant Highlandmen. Quick beat her heart, &amp;c. Now challenge-shout is heard, and soon The bare claymores are flashing bright; And off scour'd many a Lowland loon, Who ill could brook the fearful sight. âThe fiend,â quoth they, âfrom cave and glen Has pour'd those stalwart Highlandmen. âThe fiend,â quoth they, &amp;c. Then pistols from their holsters sprang, Then wax'd the skirmish fierce and hot, Blades clashing fell, and harness rang, And loudly bluster'd fire and shot; For, sooth to say, the bridegroom then Full bravely met the Highlandmen. For, sooth to say, &amp;c. And so did all his near o' kin, As Lowland race such stour may bide: But sank, at last, the mingled din, And where was then the bonnie bride? Ay, ask at those who answer can; Ask at the cunning Highlandman. Ay, ask at those, &amp;c. The bridegroom, in a woeful plight, Back to his furnish'd hall has gone, Where spread on boards so gaily dight, Cold has the wedding banquet grown. How changed since break of morning, when He thought not of the Highlandmen! How changed since, &amp;c. And who, upon Benledi's side, Beneath his shieling blest and gay, Is sitting by that bonnie bride, While round them moves the light strathspey? It is the flower of all his clan,â It is her gallant Highlandman. It is the flower, &amp;c. Re-enter Allen, snapping his fingers, and footing the ground, as he speaks. Allen. I've seen him, sirs; I have had words of him. 1st high. Had words of whom? Allen. Of the young laird himself. Omnes. Hast thou? and is he coming to the green? Allen. He bade me say he'll join you in the evening. Omnes. And not till then? Allen. Some strangers have arrived. And I have seen them too: the lady's mounted Upon a milk-white nag; and o'er her saddle A scarlet cloth is spread, both deep and wide, With bobs and fringes deck'd right gallantly; And in her riding gear she sits with grace That might become the daughter of a chief, Ay, or the king himself. 1st high. Perhaps it is the Glasgow provost's daughter, Who is, as they have said, the very match That our old laird is planning for his son. Allen. Ay, he may plan, but love will have its way,â Free, fitful love thinks scorn of prudent planning. No, young Dunarden went not to the town With simple Culloch for his sole attendant, To see the provost's daughter. Bride (to Allen). And so he will not join us till the evening? Allen. No, damsels; but here are ribands for the bride, And for you all, which he has sent by me. Now they who have the nimblest hands among you, Will catch their favourite colours as they fly. [Pulls out ribands from his pouch, and dances about in a whirling figure to the bottom of the stage, strewing about pieces of ribands, while the girls follow, to catch them as they fall. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The hall in the tower of Dunarden. Enter Dunarden and Marian. Dun. (speaking as they enter). In sooth, she well may grace a noble mansion, Or chieftain's hall, or palace of a prince, Albeit her veins swell not with ancient blood. If so much grace and sweetness cannot please him, He must be ill to win. And by my faith! Perhaps she is this same mysterious lady, To whom, as thou suspectest, his late visits, So frequent and so long, have been devoted. Marian. Ah, no! I fear another has his heart,â His constant heart, whom he, at least, will think Fairer than this sweet maid, or all besides. Dun. And if it should be so, will nothing please him But the top-flower of beauty and perfection? The second best, methinks, ay, or the third, Where fortune gilds the prize, might suit him well. Why dost thou shake thy head? Marian. What might be, and what is, stand far apart, When age and youth on the same objects look. Dun. Was I not young, when, of thy grandsire's daughters, I chose the fairest, and was plainly told Her heart and hand were promised to another? But did I then perversely mope and pine? No, I trow not: I clear'd my cloudy brow, And woo'd the second fairest, thy poor mother. Marian. So will not he. Dun. Why so: belike he will not, If thou abet his folly, as, methinks, Thou art inclined to do. Marian. No, father; not inclined: I shall regret As much as you, if any prepossession Prevent him from approving this fair maid, Who is, indeed, most gentle and engaging. Dun. Out on thy prepossessions! Younger sons, Who may be soldiers, sailors, drovers, ay, Or tinkers if they will, may choose a mate With whom, o'er sea or land, through burgh or city, To scour the world. But for the elder born, Who must uphold the honours of the race,â His ancient race,âhe is not thus at liberty To please a youthful fancy. Marian. But yet, dear sir, you may be ignorantâ Dun. What! am I ignorant? Do I not know The world sufficiently to guide and counsel Those through whose body my own blood is flowing? Not many men have had more opportunity To know men and their ways, and I have turn'd it To some account; at least I fain would think so. I have been thrice in Edinburgh, as thou knowest, In London once, in Glasgow many times; And I, forsooth, am ignorant! Marian. Dear father! You would not hear me out: I did not mean That you were ignorant of aught belonging To worldly wisdom; but his secret heart, As I have said before, his prepossessionsâ Dun. And what has he to do with prepossessions? He is, of all men, bound to wed for wealth, Since he, with his unceasing liberalities, Would bare me to the quick. No tacksman dies, But he must have appointed for his widow A house, with right of browsing for her goats, And pasture for a cow, all free of charge. The bedrid carlines, too, and orphan brats, Come all on me, through his petitioning; And I, God help me! have been weak enough To grant such suits too often. Marian. You will not say so on your dying day. Dun. For that, indeed, it may be well enough; But for our living days, I needs must say, It doth not suit at all.âIf he were frugal, And would with care lay up what is our own, Having some hoarded store, he might more reasonably Indulge his prepossessions, as you phrase it. Marian. Nay, be not angry with him. Dun. Angry with him! Such want of reason would provoke a saint! Is he to spend the rents with open hand, Stretch'd out to all who need, or all who ask; And please himself besides, by an alliance With some slight May, who brings but smiles and bloom To pay the yearly charges of her state? Marian. We do not know her yet, and cannot say That she is poor. Dun. But we may shrewdly guess. Else why those stealthy visits,âthis concealment? Oh, 'tis provoking! This, our Provost's daughter, Is just the match that would have suited us,â That would support our house, and clear our lands, And he, forsooth!âI'll cast him from my favour! Marian. I know you will not. Dun. Lady Achinmore, If he persist, I'll say and do it too. His prepossessions truly! mighty plea! Supported, too, by Lady Achinmore. [Walking in wrath to the other end of the hall. Marian (aside). I'll hold my tongue, and let the storm subside; For when he calls me Lady Achinmore, Reply is worse than useless. Dun. (returning). Methinks the lady tarries in her chamber. Marian. To lay aside her travelling attire, And put her robe or fashion'd mantua on, Requires some time. Dun. And where is Malcolm? Surely he should be In readiness, for very decency, To bid a stranger lady welcome here. Marian. He will appear ere long, and is, perhaps, Attending on her brother. Dun. No, he is not. I saw young Denison walk forth alone, As if to look for him. Marian. Here comes the lady. Enter Alice. Dun. Ah, gentle lady! were I half the man That once I was how many years gone by We shall not say), you should to this poor hold,â To these old walls which your fair presence brightens, A rousing welcome have. But times are changed, And fashion now makes all things dull and spiritless. Alice. My welcome, as it is, gives me such pleasure, I will not think of what it might have been. Your daughter has received me with a kindness That has already freed me from restraint, And given me courage to express my pleasure. Marian (to her). Thanks to thee, gentle friend! so may I call thee, Knowing so well thy worth. Might we retain thee Some weeks beneath our roof, then we might boast That our poor welcome had not miss'd its aim. Dun. Some weeks! We'll try to turn those weeks to months, And then, who knows but that our mountain soil May e'en prove warm enough for Lowland flow'r Therein to flourish sweetly. Alice. Thanks, noble sir; but we must go tomorrow. Dun. So soon! the daughter of my early friend Beneath my roof, seen like a Will o' th' wisp, Glancing and vanishing! It must not be. Were I but half the man that once I was, I'd fight thy stubborn brother hand to hand, And glaive to glaive, but he should tarry longer, Or leave his charge behind him. Alice. Nay, blame him not: it was his own good will That made him from our nearest homeward route, Though press'd for time, start these long miles aside, To pay his father's friend a passing visit; For Malcolm, he believed, was still in Glasgow, So rumour said. Dun. I thank his courtesy; But, if my name be Fergus of Dunarden, Neither the morrow, nor next morrow's morrow Shall see thee quit my tow'r. I'll go and find him, And tell him thou thyself art captive here, Though others be in thraldom of thy beauty, And shalt not be released. [Exit. Marian. Thou seest how gallantly old hearts will warm At sight of winning youth. He almost woos thee: And yet I would not pay a stepdame's duty, Where I would rather yield a sister's love. Alice. These words of kindness! Oh, you will undo me With so much kindness! [Bursts into tears. Marian. Dear, gentle creature! Have I given thee pain? I have unwittinglyâ Alice. Done nought amiss. I have a silly weakness in my nature: I can bear frowning coldness or neglect, But kindness makes me weep. Marian. And can it be that coldness or neglect Should e'er be thine to bear? Alice. Better than I have borne it. Marian. Better than thou! In all your stately city, Is there a lady fairer than thyself? Alice. Yes, Lady Achinmore, there is a creature Whose beauty changes every other face To an unnoticed blank; whose native grace Turns dames of courtly guise to household damsels; Whose voice of winning sweetness makes the tones Of every other voice intruding harshness. Marian. And if there be, conceit will mar it all; For too much homage, like the mid-day sun, Withers the flower it brightens. Alice. It may be so with others, not with her. Marian. Thou lovest her, then? Alice. O, yes! I love her dearly; And if I did not, I should hate myself. Heed not these tears, nor think, because I weep In saying that I love her, aught lurks here, Begrudging her felicity. O, no! Marian (taking her hands affectionately). Sweet Alice! why so moved? Alice. 'Tis my infirmity: I am a fool, And should not go from home, so to expose A mind bereft of all becoming firmness. Marian (embracing her). Come to my bosom; thou hast but exposed That which the more endears thee to my heart; And, wert thou firmer, I should love thee less. But, hush! let me kiss off those falling tears From thy soft cheek. I hear thy brother coming. Alice. Thy brother? Marian. No; thine own,âthy brother Claude. Ha! Malcolm, too, is with him! this is well. Enter Malcolm and Claude, whilst Alice composes herself, and endeavours to look cheerful. Mal. Fair Alice, welcome to our Highland mountains! Which, as your brother tells me, you admire, In spite of all their lone and silent barrenness. Alice. He tells you true: our fertile Lowland dales, With all their crofts and woodlands richly chequer'd, Have less variety than their bare sides. Mal. Yes, when fleet shadows of the summer clouds, Like stag-hounds on the chase, each other follow Along their purple slopes; or when soft haze Spreads o'er them its light veil of pearly grey, Through the slight rents of which the sunshine steals, Showing bright colour'd moss and mottled stones, Like spots of polish'd beauty,âthey appear Objects of varied vision most attractive. Alice. Then, to behold them in their winter guise, As I have never done! Mal. You might then see their forms enlarged and dark, Through the dim drapery of drifted rain, Like grim gigantic chieftains in array, Bidding defiance to approaching host; Or lifting their black shoulders o'er the mass Of volumed vapour gather'd round their base, Which seem like islands raised above the earth In purer regions of the firmament. Alice. And then how sweet the bushy glens between them, Where waterfalls shoot from the rocks, and streams Course on their wimpled way with brawling din! Mal. Where low-roof'd cots, with curling smoke are seen, Each with its little stack of winter fuel, And scanty lot of furrow'd corn-land near; And groups of hardy imps, who range at will, Or paddle in the brook, while bearded goats Browse on the rocky knolls, and kids are sporting Among the yellow broom. Claude. Pray thee have done, good Malcolm; thou wilt fill This girl's fancy with romantic visions, Which may, perhaps, make the rich, fertile fields Of her own country seem insipid things. Marian (to Claude). One thing, you would observe, he hasomitted In the description of his bonnie glen,â The cottage matron, with her cumbrous spade, Digging the stubborn soil; and lazy husband Stretch'd on the ground, or seated by the door, Or on his bagpipe droning some dull dirge. Mal. Well, freely I confess our mountain matrons In useful virtues do excel their mates; And in what earthly region is it otherwise? Claude. I dare not contradict thee, and be deem'd Ungallant for my pains. Enter a Servant, who delivers a packet to Claude. Alice. Is it from Glasgow? Is there within the cover aught for me? Claude. There is a letter with thy name upon it. [Malcolm withdraws some paces from her. Alice. Which, ne'ertheless, thou keepest to thyself, With eyes intently fix'd upon the writing. Is it a stranger's hand to thee unknown? Claude (giving the letter). No, not unknown. Alice. It is from Emma Graham (to Marian), and with your leave, I'll read it by this window. [Turns round, and starts upon finding Malcolm close to her. Marian. Why do you start? Alice. I knew not he was near me. Mal. (in confusion). I crave your pardon: 'twas unwittingly; I scarcely know myself why I return'd. [Alice opens the letter, whilst Claude and Malcolm stand gazing anxiously on her as she reads it to herself. Mal. (to Alice, who seems to have come to the conclusion). Your friends are well, I hope; all's well in Glasgow? Alice. She says a deadly fever rages there, And nought is seen along their dismal streets But funeral processions; nothing heard But death-bells tolling, and the hammer's sound Nailing in haste the corse's narrow house. Mal. (agitated). And she herself amidst this wreck of life! Alice. She is, ere this, removed from the contagion; For these concluding lines inform me plainly, That she and all her family were prepared To leave the town upon the following day To that on which her letter has its date. Mal. (eagerly). I thank thee, Alice. Claude (peevishly). Wherefore dost thou thank her? Mal. (haughtily). Whate'er thou hast a right to ask of me Shall have its answer. Marian (to Claude). When Highland pride is touch'd, some lack of courtesy Must be excused. You have not from this window Admired the falling of our mountain stream. [Leads him to the bottom of the hall, and detains him there in apparent conversation. Mal. (in a softened voice). So, gentle Alice, thou'rt in friendship knit With Emma Graham! and meet companions are ye! [Looking closer to the letter, which she still holds open in her hand. Forgive me; Lowland ladies far surpass, As fair and ready scribes, our mountain maids: I ne'er before saw lines by her indited. Alice (putting it up hastily; then hesitating, then recovering herself.) No; why should I withhold it from thine eye; For still the sweet expressions from her pen Excel the beauty of its characters. [Gives it to him. Peruse it then (aside, as she turns from him) while I peruse myself. Mal. (returning the letter, after having read it). Thou art in tears, sweet Alice; has thy mind Some boding apprehensions for her safety? Alice. No, God forbid! I have a feeble body, The worn-out case of a more feeble mind, And oft will weep for nothing. Heed me not Mal. No, say not so: thy mind and body both Are lovely yoke-fellows, and will togetherâ God grant it be so!âhold their prosp'rous course For many years. (Seeing her endeavours to speak.) Strive not to answer me; This wish, though most sincere, deserves no thanks. Enter Dunarden, followed by Servants, carrying dishes of meat, &amp;c. Dun. Come, honour'd guests, the first dish of our meal, Poor though it be, is passing to the board; Shall we not follow it? Although, in verity, I am ashamed that such a poor reception Is offer'd to such friends. Marian. Dear sir, they will forgive what things are lacking, The heart's kind cheer not being of the number. Dun. (to Alice). Had I had timely notice of your coming, I had sent messengers for thirty miles, Cross moor and mountain, to invite our neighbours; And tables had been cover'd in this hall, Round which we should have held a merry feast. And this same wedding, too, detains the clan: So that our wings are clipt on every side. Alice. Your courtesy is great: but surely, sir, A merry wedding well may make amends For a lost feast, e'en in Dunarden hall. Dun. And so it shall, fair Alice.âPardon me That I should be so bold to name you thus! At fall of eve we'll join their merriment; And thou shalt be my partner in the dance. [Taking her hand gallantly. I'll have thee all and solely to myself; Unless, perhaps, if these old legs should fail, Thou wilt accept of this young Highlander [Pointing to Malcolm. To be my substitute.âCome, gentles all! By this soft lily hand let me conduct The daughter of my old and honour'd friend; My trysted partner too. Aha! aha! [Leading off Alice gaily with a strathspey step. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A lobby or entrance-room, with fire-arms, swords, and fishing-tackle hung on the walls. Servants are seen passing to and fro with plaids and bundles of heath in their hands. Enter Housekeeper. House. Make all the speed ye may: in the long chamber There must be twenty bed-frames quickly set, And stuff'd with heather for the tacksmen; ay, And for their women, in the further room, Fourteen besides, with plaidings for them all. The wedding folks have broken up their sport, And will be here before we are prepared. Enter the Butler. Butler. And what are twenty beds, when all the drovers, And all the shieling herdsmen from Bengorach, Must have a lair provided for the night. House. And who says so? Butler. E'en the young laird himself. House. 'Tis always so; Dunarden's courtesy, With all his honied words, costs far less trouble Than young Dunarden's thoughtless kindness doth. The foul fiend take them all! Have we got plaids For loons like them! Butler. Faith, we at least must try to find them bedding. House. Let each of them find on the green hill sward The breadth of his own back, and that, I trow, Is bed enough for them. Herdsmen, indeed! [Several servants coming all about together. More plaids! more plaids! we have not yet enow. Another servant. An Elspy says the gentlefolks must have Pillows and other gear. House. Out on you! clamouring round me with your wants, Like daws about the ruin'd turret! think ye That IâI am distracted with you all! Butler (aside). And with some cups of good Ferntosh besides. House. Howe'er the shieling herdsmen may be lodged, I have provided for the Lowland strangers Right handsomely. Butler. The bed of state, no doubt, is for the lady, And for the gentleman the arras chamber. House. Thou art all wrong: the arras is so ragged, And bat holes in the cornice are so rife, That Lady Achinmore bade me prepare His lodging in the north side of the tower, Beside Dunarden's chamber. Butler. They leave the house to-morrow, waiting only To take a social breakfast. My best wine And good Ferntosh must be upon the table, To which the beef, and fish, and old ewe cheese Will give a relish. And your pretty playthings Of china saucers, with their fairy cups, In which a wren could scarcely lay her egg,â Your tea-pot, pouring from its slender beak Hot water, as it were some precious drug, Must be, for fashion's sake, set in array To please the Lowland lady. House. Mind thy concerns, and I will look to mine. My pretty playthings are in daily use, As I hear say, in the great town of Edinburgh; And 'tis a delicate and wholesome beverage Which they are filled withal. I like, myself, To sip a little of it. Butler. Dainty dear! No doubt thou dost; aught stronger would offend thee. Thou wouldst, I think, call rue or wormwood sweet, Were it the fashion in your town of Edinburgh. But, hark! the bridal folks are at the door; We must not parley longer. [Music without. I hear their piper playing the âGood-night.â Enter Allen. Butler. They are at hand, I hear: and have ye had A merry evening, Allen? Allen. That we have. Dunarden danced with that sweet Lowland lady, As though it made him twenty years the younger. House. Dunarden! Danced she not with young Dunarden, Who is, so says report, her destined husband? Allen. Yes; at the end, for one dull reel or two They footed it together. But, believe me, If this rich Provost's daughter be not satisfied With being woo'd by substitute, which homage The old laird offers her abundantly, She'll ne'er be lady of this mansion; no, Nor of her many, many thousand marks, One golden piece enrich Dunarden's house. House. Woe's me! our Malcolm is a wilful youth! And Lady Achinmore would dance with Claude? Allen. She danced with him, and with the bridegroom also. House. That, too, would be a match of furtherance To the prosperity of our old house. Butler. But that she is a widow, and, I reckon, Some years his elder, it might likely be. House. And why should that be such a mighty hindrance? Allen. Fie, butler! dost thou utter, in such presence, Disqualifying words of age and widowhood? House. You are mislearn'd and saucy, both of you.â But now they are at hand. SONG without, of several voices. The sun is down, and time gone by, The stars are twinkling in the sky, Nor torch nor taper longer may Eke out a blithe but stinted day; The hours have pass'd with stealthy flight, We needs must part: good night, good night! The bride unto her bower is sent, And ribald song and jesting spent; The lover's whisper'd words and few Have bid the bashful maid adieu; The dancing floor is silent quite, No foot bounds there: good night, good night! The lady in her curtain'd bed, The herdsman in his wattled shed, The clansmen in the heather'd hall, Sweet sleep be with you, one and all! We part in hopes of days as bright As this gone by: good night, good night! Sweet sleep be with us, one and all! And if upon its stillness fall The visions of a busy brain, We'll have our pleasure o'er again, To warm the heart, to charm the sight, Gay dreams to all! good night, good night! House. We've listened here too long: go all of you And get the rooms prepared! My head's distracted! [Exeunt all, different ways. SCENE IV. A bed-chamber. Enter Alice and Marian, with a Servant before them, carrying lights. Marian. You must be tired with all this noisy merriment So closely following a lengthen'd journey. Alice. To be among the happy and the kind Keeps weariness at bay; and yet I own I shall be glad to rest. Marian. And may you find it, sound and undisturb'd! There is among our household damsels here, A humble friend of yours, the child of one Who was your father's servant. Alice. Ha! little Jessie, once my playfellow, And since well known to me, as the attendant Of a relation, in whose house I found her, Some two years past: a gentle, faithful creature. Marian. The same, she will attend upon you gladly, And do what you require. See, here she is. Enter Jessie. Alice. Jessie, my old acquaintance! I am glad To find thee thus, domesticated happily In such a home. I hope thou hast been well, Since I last met with thee. Jessie. I thank you, madam; I am right well; and, were I otherwise, To see you here would make me well again, Marian (to Alice). The greatest kindness I can show thee now Is to retire, and leave thee to prepare For what thou needst so much. [Kissing her. May sweet sound sleep refresh thee! Oh! it grieves me To think that we must part with thee so soon; And that ye are determined to return To that infected city. Alice. Be not afraid for us. We shall pass through it, And only tarry for an hour or two. Good night, and thanks for all your gentle kindness! Thanks, in few words, but from my inmost heart! [Exit Marian. And thou art here, good Jessie. I am glad,â Right glad to see thee; but I'm tired and spent, And (take it not unkindly) cannot speak As I was wont to do. [Throws herself into a chair, whilst Jessie begins to uncoil her hair, and take out the ornaments. Jessie. I will prepare you for your bed, dear madam, As quickly as I can. To-morrow morning Your strength and spirits too will be restored. Alice. Thou'rt a good creature. Dost thou still remember The pretty songs thou used to sing so sweetly? SONG. Jessie (singing gaily). My heart is light, my limbs are light, My purse is light, my dear; Yet follow me, my maiden bright, In faith! thou needst not fear. The wallet on a rover's back Is scanty dower for thee, But we shall have what lordies lack For all their golden fee. The plume upon my bonnet bound, And broadsword by my side, We'll follow to the war-pipe's sound, With fortune for our guide. Light are my limbs, my purse, my heart, Yet follow me, my dear; Bid Care good-bye, with kinsfolk part; In faith! thou needst not fear. Alice. I thank thee: that was once a favourite song. I know not how it was; I liked it then For the gay reckless spirit of the tune. But there is one which I remember well, One my poor aunt was wont to bid thee sing; Let me have that, I pray thee. SONG. They who may tell love's wistful tale, Of half its cares are lighten'd; Their bark is tacking to the gale, The sever'd cloud is brighten'd. Love like the silent stream is found Beneath the willows lurking, The deeper, that it hath no sound To tell its ceaseless working. Submit, my heart; thy lot is cast, I feel its inward token; I feel this mis'ry will not last, Yet last till thou art broken. Alice. Thou singest sweetly, ay, and sadly too, Even as it should be sung. I thank thee, Jessie. Jessie (after having entirely undone her hair, and taken the fastenings from other parts of her dress). Now, madam, let me fetch your gown and coif. Alice. I want no further service, my good Jessie, I'll do the rest myself: and so, good night; I shall be soon in bed. Good night, and thanks. Jessie. Not yet good night; I will return again, And take away the light. Alice. Well; as thou wilt: but leave me for a while. [Exit Jessie. This day, with all its trials, is at length Come to an end. My wrung and wrestling heart! How is it with thee now? Thy fond delusions Lie strew'd and broken round thee, like the wrecks Of western clouds when the bright sun is set. We look upon them glowing in his blaze, And sloping wood, and purple promontory, And castled rock distinctly charm the eye: What now remains but a few streaky fragments Of melting vapour, cold and colourless? [After a thoughtful pause. There's rest when hope is goneâthere should be rest. And when I think of her who is the cause, Should I complain? To be preferr'd to her! Preferr'd to Emma Graham, whom I myself Cannot behold but with an admiration That sinks into the heart, and in the fancy Goes hand in hand with every gentle virtue That woman may possess or man desire!â The thought was childish imbecility. Away, away! I will not weep for this. Heaven granting me the grace for which I'll pray Humbly and earnestly, I shall recover From this sad state of weakness. If she love him, She'll make him happier far than I could do; And if she love him not, there is good cause That I should pity him; not selfishly On my own misery dwell.âAy, this should be; But will it be?âOh, these rebellious tears! [Covering her face with her hands, and throwing herself back in her chair, in a state of abandonment. Enter, by the other end of the chamber, the phantom of a beautiful young woman, which advances a few paces, and then remains still. Alice (raising her face). Who's there?âIs there true vision in mine eyes? [Rising quickly, and going with open arms towards the phantom. Dear Emma! dear, dear Emma! how is this, That thou art here, unlook'd for at this hour, So many miles from home? Alas! that face Of ghastly paleness, and that alter'd look Of sad solemnity!âSpeak to me quickly; I dare approach no nearer, till I hear Words of thy natural voice. Art thou alive? Phantom. A term, short as the passing of a thought, Hath brought me from the chamber where my friends Are now lamenting round my lifeless body. Alice. And 'tis thy spirit which before mine eyes Thy body's semblance wears: and thou art nothing That mortal hands may touch or arms encircle! O look not on me with that fixed look! Thou lovest me still, else thou hadst not been here, And yet I fear thee. Phantom. Fear me not, dear Alice! I yearn'd to look upon thee ere I pass That gulf which parts the living from the dead: And I have words to utter which thine ear Must listen to, thy mind retain distinctly. Alice. Say what thou wilt; thou art a blessed spirit. And canst not do me harm.â I know it well: but let thy words be few; The fears of nature are increasing on me. [Bending one knee to the ground. O God! Lord of all beings, dead and living! Strengthen and keep me in this awful hour! Phantom. And to thy fervent prayer I say, Amen. Let this assure thee, that, though diff'rent natures Invest us now, we are the children still Of one great Parent; thou in mortal weeds Of flesh and blood; I in a state inexplicable To human comprehension.âHear my words. Alice. I listen most intently. Phantom. The room in which I died, hath a recess Conceal'd behind the arras, long disused And now forgotten; in it stands a casket, The clam shell of our house is traced upon it; Open, and read the paper therein lodged. When my poor body is to earth committed, Do this without delay. And now, farewell! I must depart. Alice. Ah! whither, dearest Emma? Will a moment Transport thee to heaven's court of blessedness, To ecstasy and glory? Phantom. These are presumptuous words. My place, appointed In mercy to a weak and sinful creature, I soon shall know. Farewell, till we shall meet, From sin, and fear, and doubt, released for ever! [Exit. [Alice stands trembling and gazing, as the phantom disappears, and then falls on the ground in a swoon. Presently re-enter Jessie. Jessie. Mercy upon us! lying on the ground! Life is not gone; God grant it be not so! Lady, dear lady! No; she does not hear. [Endeavours in vain to raise her, then runs off in great alarm, and is heard without, knocking and calling at the door of another chamber. (Without.) Open the door! Rise, Lady Achinmore. Marian (without). I am not yet undress'd: what is the matter? Jessie (without). Come to the lady's chamber: follow me. Mal. (without, opening the door of his apartment). What has befallen? Is any one unwell? Re-enter Jessie, followed by Marian, who both run to Alice, raising her from the floor, and one supporting her head, while the other chafes her temples and the palms of her hands, &amp;c. Marian. Support her drooping head, while from my closet I fetch some water, and restoring drugs, Whose potent smell revives suspended life. Mal. (looking in upon them from the door). O leave her not! I'll find whate'er is wanting. [Exit. Marian. There is a little motion of her lip; Her bosom heaves: thank God! life is not fled. How long hadst thou been absent from the room? Jessie. Some little time; and thought, on my return, To find her gone to bed. Marian. How was she when thou leftst her? Jessie. She was well then. Marian. It hath been very sudden. Re-enter Malcolm, with phials, &amp;c. Mal. (applying herbs to her nostrils, while Marian pours out essence from the phial, and rubs her temples and hands). Life is returning; she is laid uneasily; Let me support her on a stronger arm. [Taking her from Marian, and supporting her. There's motion on her lips, and on her eyelids. Her eyes begin, through their soft raven lashes, To peer like dew-drops from the harebell's core, As the warm air of day by slow degrees The closed leaves gently severs.âYes; she moves. How art thou now, sweet Alice? Marian. See, she looks up, and gazes on us too; But, oh, how strangely! Mal. Why do her eyes thus wander round the chamber? (To Alice.) Whom dost thou seek for, Alice? Alice. She's gone; I need not look; a mortal eye Shall never, never look on her again. [A peal of thunder heard. Hear ye that sound? She is upon her way. Marian. What does she mean? It was a sultry night, And threaten'd storm and lightning. Mal. (to Alice). Thou'st been asleep, and scarcely yet art waking, Thy fancy is still busied with its dream. Alice (raising herself more, and looking towards the place where the phantom disappeared). It was no dream: upon that spot it stood; I saw it,âsaw it for a lengthen'd time,â Saw it distinctively. Mal. Whom didst thou see? No living creature could have enter'd here. Alice. O would that it had been a living creature! Her beauty was the beauty of a corse Newly composed in death; yet her dark eyes Were open, gazing wistfully upon me. Mal. (hastily withdrawing his arms from her, and clasping his hands together in agony). Thou hast seen Emma Graham! Alice (rousing herself). Is Malcolm here? I am confused,âbewilder'd; I know not what I've seen, or what I've said: Perhaps it was a dream. Mal. It was no dream; Or if it was, 'twas one of sad import. Oh, if it be!âthere is distraction in it. [Tossing his arms, &amp;c. Marian. Dear brother! such wild gestures of despair For the mere shapings of a sleepy brain! Mal. It was not sleep from which we have revived her. Marian. And grant it were not, swooning, I've been told, Will sometimes have its dream as well as sleep. Alice. I was not well; I have been long unwell; Weakness and wretchedness disturb the brain; Perhaps it was the vision of a swoon. Be not so miserable, gentle Malcolm! O that this vision did foretell my death, If she were well and happy! Mal. Forgive me, dearest Alice! O, forgive me! When paining thee, I'm hateful to myself. [Taking both her hands, which he presses to his lips. Marian. Leave us, dear brother! go to thine apartment. Mal. I'll go where yearning nature urges me. [Going, then returning again to Alice. And didst thou hear her voice? Enter Claude. Claude. Is Alice well? I heard a busy noise. How art thou, sister? Alice. I have had a swoon, But am recover'd from it. Go to rest. [Aside to Marian and Malcolm. Say nothing of the vision. O, be silent! Mal. (aside to himself, as he goes off). Is he so much concern'd? No, no, he is not: He does not,âcannot feel what tortures me. Claude. Dost thou avoid me, Malcolm? Dost thou think That kindness to my sister can offend me? Mal. I've other thoughts, which do no wrong to thee, And owe thee no account. [Exit. Claude (aside). He is offended. (Aloud to Marian.) Thanks to you, dear madam! For your kind care of Alice. Rest, I hope, Will perfectly restore her. The fatigue Of her long journey, and the evening pastime Has been too much for one so delicate. (To Alice.) Undress and go to bed, poor harass'd creature! I trust to-morrow thou wilt wake refresh'd. Alice. I hope so too, dear Claude; and so good night. Remain no longer here. (Exit Claude.) I'm glad he's gone. [Apeal of thunder as before. That awful sound again! she's on her way: But storm or thunderbolt can do no harm To disembodied spirits. Marian. I may not leave thee here, my gentle friend; In my apartment thou shalt pass the night. Come then with me: I dare not leave thee here, Where, sleeping or awake, thou hast received Some painful shockâRise: lean upon my arm. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A rudely paved court, with a low building in front. The stage perfectly dark, and thunder heard at a distance. Enter Malcolm, who goes to the door of the building, and knocks. Mal. Ho! Culloch! art thou waking? Rouse thee, Culloch! I hear him snoring in his heavy sleep, Press'd with the glutton feasting of the day. [Knocking louder than before. Canst thou not hear? Holla! ho! rouse thee, Culloch! The heavy sluggard! Ha! he's stirring now. [Laying his ear close to the door. Cul. (within). Who's there? Mal. It is thy master. Cul. What is wanted? It is not morning yet. Mal. That drawling voice! He is not yet awake. Very loud.) Rise, man, immediately: Open the door, and do what I desire thee. [To himself, after a short pause. Six hours upon my gallant steed will end This agony of doubt.âI'll know my fateâ Joy or despair.âHe is asleep again. [Knocking as before. Make haste, make haste, I say! inert and sluggish! O that, like spirits, on the tempest borne, The transit could be made! Alas! alas! If what I fear hath happen'd, speed or stillness, Or day or midnight,âevery circumstance Of mortal being will to me be nothing. Not ready yet!âHa! now I see the light. [Light seen from the window. Six hours of my brave steed, and if my fears Are then confirm'dâforgive me, noble creature! We'll lay our burdens down and die together. Enter Culloch slowly from the building, rubbing his eyes with one hand, and holding a candle in the other. Haste, tardy creature! art thou sleeping still? Cul. What is your honour's will? O hone! O hone! It is a murky night. Mal. I know it is. Unlock the stable door, and saddle quickly My gallant Oscar. [Thunder again. Cul. Does your honour hear it? Mal. Hear what? Cul. The thunder growling o'er Benmore: And that was lightning too that flared so fleetly: The welkin's black as pitch. Mal. And let it growl; and be the welkin pall'd In sackcloth! To the spot where I am going We'll find the way by instinct.âLinger not: Do what I have desired thee instantly. Cul. Ay, ay! the saddle upon Oscar's back. The bran new saddle would your honour have? Mal. Yes, fool, and set about it instantly. [Exit Culloch. These dark and heavy bodings of my mind Come from no natural bent of apprehension. It must be so. Yet, be it dream or vision, Unmeaning chance, or preternatural notice, As oft hath been vouchsafed, if living seers Or old tradition lie not,âthis uncertainty Ere morning dawn would drive my brain distracted, Were I inactively to wait for day; Therefore, to horse! [Thunder louder than before. That sound is in accordance with the storm In this perturbed breast. Is it not ominous Of that which soon shall strike me to the dust, A blasted lonely remnant?â Methinks he should ere thisâtime flies apace; The listless sluggard must be urged to hasten His so unwilling task. [Exit hastily. ACT II. SCENE I. The cross of Glasgow. A great crowd of people are discovered, and bells heard tolling occasionally from the neighbouring churches. 1st crowd. Ah! woe is me! so bonnie and so young! Of all that death hath ta'en in this fell ravage, None hath he ta'en that seem'd so ill to suit The coffin and the mould. Ah! woe is me! 2d crowd. Ay, neighbour, she was one mark'd from them all. Though we have many fair and gracious ladies, We had not one who could be pair'd with her: The bonniest lass in all the west of Scotland. 1st crowd. Ay, thou mayst say, the bonniest and the best. 3d crowd. Nay, softly, David! for the point of goodness, That is a matter, on her burial day, We may not question; yet, if it be trueâ 1st crowd. If it be true! It is not: nought is true That can throw speck or spot upon her virtue. 1st crowd woman (to 1st crowd). Be not so angry, man; my husband means Against her maiden virtue no reproach, E'en if her faith was papishly inclined. 1st crowd. She was no Papish; I'll take oath upon it. The cloven foot of Satan in my shoe Is at this point of time as surely buckled, As that she was aught but a pure believerâ A good and godly lady. 1st crowd woman. That gentleman, so brave and soldierly, Who lately has return'd from foreign wars, Is a rank Romanist, and has been oft Received by her. But, Lord preserve us all! We, by God's grace, may sit by Satan's side,â Ay, on the self-same settle, yet the while, Be ne'er one whit the worse. 3d crowd. And I should guessâ 2d crowd. Hist, hist! the funeral's coming: I hear the heavy wheels, and o'er the top Of all those cluster'd heads I see the feathers,â The snow-white feathers of the high-coped hearse Move slowly. Woe the day! oh, woe the day! How changed her state! She was on milk-white steed Mounted right gallantly, with cap and plume, When I beheld her last. Voice (without). Make way, good folks, and let the ladies pass. 2d crowd (to him without). None can pass here on horseback. Voice (without). It is the Provost's family: make way. 2d crowd (as before). An 'twere the king's, they must dismount, I trow, Or wait till the procession be gone by. Enter Alice, Marian, and Claude. Claude (to crowd). What makes so great a concourse; and those bells To toll so dismally? Whose funeral Are ye convened to see? 1st crowd. Ah, sir! the fairest lady of the place. I warrant you have seen her many a time; They call'd her Emma Graham. Claude. It cannot be! What didst thou call her? Speak; Repeat her name. 1st crowd. Her name is Emma Graham; her father isâ Claude. No more! no more! too well I comprehend it. And death hath dealt his blow on what was life's Completest, dearest, best. [Covers his face with his cloak. Marian (turning to Alice, and supporting her). Dear Alice, thou art pale, and faint, and ill; Lean upon me, my friend. Alice. Think not of me: poor Claude! my heart-struck brother! His wound is deep and sudden: for this stroke I was prepared. Voices (without). Stand back; stand closer: it is now at hand. [A funeral procession crosses the stage: the mourners following the hearse on foot. 1st crowd. Ah! never corse was follow'd to the grave With deeper sorrow! 1st crowd woman. Ay, tears are following tears down manly cheeks, As gouts fall in Saint Mungo's dripping aisle, Near which the grave is dug that shall receive her. 1st crowd. That is her grey-hair'd father, so bow'd down; And those her brothers walking by his side. 2d crowd. Then all the kindred walking, two and two. 3d crowd. But who is he that follows after all, In mourner's cloak so muffled to the eyes? He walks alone, not mated like the rest; And yet, methinks, his gait and motion say The greatest weight of grief falls to his share. Claude. God knows who hath the greatest share! Not he. [Pushing eagerly through the crowd. Alice. Where goest thou, Claude? [Endeavouring to hold him. Claude. Prevent me not. Shall mourning weeds alone Have privilege, and sorrow be debarr'd. [Exit hastily after the funeral, and the crowd disperses different ways, Alice, Marian, and their servants alone occupying the front of the stage. Marian. Dear Alice! how thou tremblest every limb, As in an ague fit! Alice. It was no dream; It was no strong delusion of the fancy. Marian. This is indeed an awful confirmation. But stay no longer here: go to thy home; Thou hast great need of rest. Alice. I have more need, Within my closet, on my bended knees, To pray for mercy on my sinful self, And those to me most dear,âpoor sinners all. This is a sad and awful visitation. Marian. But didst thou not expect to find it so? I thought thou wast prepared. Alice. I thought so too; But certainty makes previous expectation Seem, by comparison, a state of hope. Marian. We now are free to hold upon our way. Let us proceed: come on with me, dear Alice! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The house of the provost, and the apartment of Claude, who enters, followed by Crawford, and throws himself back into a chair with the action of deep distress. Claude. Follow me not, my friend; it is in vain That friendly soothing would assuage my grief. Craw. Grieve not for that which is, indeed, most grievous, Beyond all measure. Claude. Can we measure grief, And say, so much of it shall be my portion, And only this? A prudent, lesson'd sorrow, Usurps the name it bears.âShe was the light That brighten'd every object; made this world A place worth living in. This beauteous flame Hath in the socket sunk: I am in darkness, And no returning ray shall cheer my sight. This earth, and every thing that it contains, Is a dull blank around me. Craw. Say not so! It grieves my heart to hear thee. Say not so. Claude. I will not grieve thee then; I'll hold my tongue; But shall I feel the less?âOh, had she lived! Craw. Perhaps she had but caused thee greater sorrow; For how wouldst thou have brook'd to see her hand, Had it so been, bestow'd upon another? Claude. Why should I entertain a thought so painful? [Raising his head proudly, after a thoughtful pause. Yes, I can entertain it, and believe That, even as another's, it were happiness To see her yet alive; to see her still Looking as never eyes but hers did look; Speaking such words as she alone could speak, Whose soften'd sounds thrill'd through the nerves, and dwelt, When heard no more, on the delighted fancy, Like chanted sweetness!âAll is now extinct!â Like some base thing, unmeet for mortal eye, The sod hath cover'd all. [After a thoughtful pause. Hath cover'd all! Craw. Dear Claude! why wilt thou dwell on things so dismal? Let me read to thee from some pious book; Wilt thou permit me? [He remains silent and thoughtful. Dost thou hear me, Claude? Claude (muttering to himself, without attending to Crawford). The sexton has the key; and if he had not, The wall may yet be clear'd.â The banded mourners scatter to their homes, Where kinsfolk meet, and social hearths blaze bright, And leave the grave in midnight loneliness! But should it be? Craw. (listening to him). I understand these words. But if he go, he shall not go alone. Enter a Servant. Claude (impatiently). What brings thee here? Serv. A gentleman desires to see you, sir. Claude. Tell him I am gone forth.âSuch ill-timed visits! Is the sore heart a sear'd and harden'd thing For every fool to handle? [Exit. Craw. I'll follow him: he should not be alone. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A large room, with rich furniture, and the walls hung with pictures. Enter the Provost and Marian, by different doors. Provost. How is poor Alice? Marian. She is more composed; For tears have flow'd uncheck'd, and have relieved her. I have persuaded her to take an hour Of needful rest upon her bed; and Jessie, That kindly creature, watches her the while. Provost. Ay, that is right. And now, my right good lady, Let me in plain but grateful words repeat, That your great kindness, leaving thus your home, And taking such a journey for the comfort Of my poor child, is felt by me most truly, As it deserves. May God reward you for it! Marian. I will not, sir, receive such thanks unqualified; They are not due to me. Regard for Alice,â And who that knows her feels not such regard,â Was closely blended with another motive, When I determined on this sudden journey. Provost. Another motive! Marian. Has not Claude inform'd you That Malcolm left Dunarden secretly, The night before we did ourselves set forth? Provost. He has not. Ha! and wot you where he went? Marian. I wot not, but I guess: and it was he, As I am almost confident, who walk'd The last of all the mourners, by himself, In this day's sad procession. Provost (pulling a letter hastily from his pocket). Madam, sit down; I'll cast mine eyes again O'er this your father's letter. Pray sit down! I may not see you thus. [Setting a chair with much courtesy, and obliging her to sit, whilst he goes aside and reads a letter earnestly. He then returns to her. My friend has many words of courtesy; It is his habit; but subtracting from them The plain unvarnish'd sense, and thereto adding What, from this secret journey of your brother, May be inferr'd,âthe real truth is thisâ At least it so appears to my poor reasonâ [Preventing her as she rises from her seat. Nay, sit, I pray you, Lady Achinmore; We'll talk this matter over thoroughly, And leave no bashful doubts hid in a corner, For lack of honest courage to produce them. [Sits down by her. Marian. Proceed, good sir, I listen earnestly. Provost. As it appears to me, the truth is this, That Malcolm, whom your father doth admit, Albeit a great admirer of my daughter, To be at present somewhat disinclined To give up youthful liberty so early, As he from more acquaintance with her virtues Ere long will of his own accord desire,â (Pointing to the letter) âso he expresses it. Marian. And with sincerity. Provost. Well, grant it, lady! The truth doth ne'ertheless appear to be, That this young gallant, Malcolm of Dunarden, With all her virtues, loves not Alice Denison, And loves another. Marian. Rather say, hath loved. Provost. I'll not unsay my words. His heart is with her, Low as she lies: and she who won his heart From such a maid as Alice Denison, Will keep it too, e'en in her shroud. No, no! We've spread our vaunting sails against the wind, And cannot reach our port but with such peril As will o'ermatch the vantage. Marian. Say not so. Time will make all things as we wish to have them. Provost. Time works rare changes, which they may abide Who are intent upon them. Shall I carry My vessel where her cargo is not wanted?â Tobacco to th' Antipodes, and wait Till they have learn'd to use and relish it?â Shall I do this, when other marts are near With open harbours ready to receive her? Marian. Dear sir, you must not think I will assent To what would mar the long and cherish'd wish Of me and mine. And we had fondly hoped That you had been desirous of this union Between our families. Provost. Your father won my friendship years ago, When with his goodly mien and belted plaid, His merry courtesy and stately step, He moved amongst our burghers at the Cross, As though he had been chieftain o'er us all; And I have since enjoy'd his hospitality, In his proud mountain hold. Marian. I recollect it: proud and glad he was Of such a guest. Provost. Dost thou? Ay, then it was, That, seeing his fair stripling by his sideâ A graceful creature, full of honest sense And manly courageâI did like the notion, That Alice, then a little skipping child, With years before her still to play about me, Should in some future time become the lady Of that young Highland chief. But years bring thoughts Of a more sober and domestic hue. Why should I covet distant vanities, And banish from my sight its dearest object? (Rising from his chair.) Have you observed those pictures? Marian (rising also). I have. They are the portraits of your parents: Their features bear resemblance to your own. Provost. My mother's do: and look at her, dear madam! With all the bravery of that satin dress Clasp'd up with jewels, and those roses stuck Amongst her braided hair, she was the daughter And sober heiress of a saving burgher, Whose hoarded pelf in my brave father's hands Raised such industrious stir in this good city, As changed her from a haunt of listless sluggards To the fair town she is. What need have I To eke my consequence with foreign matches? Alice shall wed, I hope, some prosperous merchant, And live contentedly, my next door neighbour, With all her imps about her. Marian. Wed whom she may, I hope she will be happy. Provost. I do believe that is your hearty wish: And having plainly told you what I think Of this projected match, as it concerns My daughter and myself,âI will proceed To that which may concern my ancient friend. Should any mortgage press on his estate, Or any purchase of adjoining lands Make money a desired object with him, He need but speak the word; at easy int'rest He shall receive what sums he may require, And need not fear that I shall e'er distress him With hard ill-timed demands. In faith, he need not! Marian. Dear sir, he knows full well your gen'rous heart Hath for its minister a liberal hand: In truth, he would not fear to be your debtor. Provost. Not all the rum and sugar of Jamaica, In one huge warehouse stored, should make me press him, Though apt occasion offer'd e'er so temptingly. Then why should Malcolm bend his youthful neck To wedlock's yoke for sordid purposes? The boy shall be my friend; and when his mind Is free to think upon another love, I'll guide him to a very comely ladyâ Yea, more than one, that he may have a choiceâ Who may prove both a match of love and profit; But hear you plainly, not to Alice Denison. Marian. Oh, you are kind and noble! but my fatherâ Provost. Say nought for him; he'll answer for himself: And through his maze of friendly compliments, I'll trace at last his veritable thoughts. [Taking her hand kindly. Now, having thus so plainly told my mind, Look on me as a man to whom again You may as freely speak. Marian. And so I will: The happiness of one, dear to us both, Requires that I should do it. Provost (surprised). How so? is it of Alice you would speak? Marian. Yes, but another time; for here comes Jessie. Enter Jessie. (To Jessie.) How is she now? I hope she is asleep. Jessie. She has not slept, but lies composed and easy, And wishes now to see you. [Exit Marian. Provost. How art thou, Jessie? Jessie. Well, an' please your honour. Provost. I hear thou hast become a Highland lass; But, if thou really like the Lowlands better, Thy native country, tell me honestly: I'll make thy husband, whomsoe'er thou choose, A freeman of this town. If he have brains, And some few marks beside, he'll thrive upon it. Jessie. I thank you, sir: his marks are few indeed. Provost. Well, never mind; let us but have the brains, And we will make the best of it.âPoor Jessie! I well remember thee a barefoot girl, With all thy yellow hair bound in a snood: Thy father too. Jessie. Do you remember him? Provost. Yes, Saunders Fairlie. Better man than Saunders In factory or warehouse never bustled. Enter Servant. Provost. What is the matter, Archy? On thy face Thou wearst a curious grin: what is the matter? Serv. The baillie bid me to inform your honour, The country hucksters and the market wives Have quarrell'd, and are now at deadly strife, With all the brats and schoolboys of the town Shouting and bawling round them. Provost. Good sooth! whene'er those wives with hands and tongue Join in the fray, the matter must be look'd to. I will be with them soon. [Exit servant. To think now of those creatures! E'en at the time when death is in the city Doing his awful work, and our sad streets Blacken'd with funerals, that they must quarrel About their worldly fractions! Woe is me! For all our preachings and our Sabbath worship, We are, I fear, but an ungodly race. Enter another Servant. And what has brought thee, too? Serv. There is a woman come from Anderston, Whose neighbour, on pretence of some false debt, Has pounded her milch cow,âher only cow. Provost. Is that a case to occupy my time? Let her go with it to the younger baillie. Serv. I told her so, your honour, but she weeps, And says the younger baillie is so proud, She dare not speak to him. Provost. Poor simpleton! Well, then, I needs must see her. Re-enter 1st Servant. Tut! here again! What is the matter now? 1st serv. A servant all cross'd o'er wi' livery lace, As proud and grand as any trumpeter, Is straight from Blantyre come, and says, my lord Would greatly be obliged, if that your honour Would put off hearing of that suit to-morrow, As he must go to Edinburgh. Provost. Tell the messenger To give my humble service to his lordship, And say, I could not, but with great injustice To the complaining party, grant delay, Who, being poor, should not be further burden'd With more attendance; I will therefore hear The cause to-morrow, at the hour appointed. Exit 1st, and re-enter 2d Servant. Still more demands! For what foul sin of mine Was I promoted to this dignity? From morn till eve, there is no peace for me. [Exit Provost, speaking to the servants as they go out. SCENE IV. Before the walls of a churchyard, a narrow iron gate at the bottom of the stage, behind which the gleaming of a torch is faintly seen; the front of the stage entirely dark. Solemn music is heard, as the scene opens. Enter a Sexton, with keys, followed by Claude and Crawford. Claude. Music! and from the spot! what may it be? Sexton. Leave was requested that a solemn dirge Should be this night sung by some grave; but whose, Or e'en by whom requested, I am ignorant. Some Papist, like enough: but what of that? Craw. (to sexton). How many graves thou'st made in one short week! Thou hast been busy in thy sad vocation. Sexton. I have, good sooth, and knew it would be so, A month before the fell disease began. Craw. How knew it? Sexton. He, the sighted man from Skye, Was in the town; and, at the crowded cross, Fell into strong convulsions, at the sight Which there appear'd to him. Craw. What did he see? Sexton. Merchants, and lairds, and deacons, making bargains, And setting trystes, and joking carelessly, Swathed in their shrouds; some to the very chin, Some breast-high, others only to the loins. It was a dismal, an appalling sight; And when I heard of it, I knew right well My busy time was coming. Claude (to sexton, impatiently). Didst thou say That leave has been requested for a dirge To be this night sung by some Papist's grave? Sexton. Papist or not I cannot surely say, I ask'd no questions. Craw. Having cause, no doubt, To be well satisfied no harm would ensue. Sexton. No harm. In this retired nook it cannot Annoy the living; and for the departed, Nought can disturb their rest. Craw. Hast thou not heard of restless souls returning? Perhaps thou'st seen it, during thirty years In which thou hast been sexton of this parish. Sexton. In all that time I ne'er could say with certainty That aught of such a nature pass'd before me; But I have seen uncertain shadows move As 'twere confusedly, and heard strange sounds,â Stranger than wind or natural cause could utter. Craw. And thou wast sure they were unnatural sounds? And hast thou heard them often? Sexton. Many times: But that was in the first years of mine office. I am not now alarm'd: use makes me feel As if no harm could e'er befall the sexton: And e'en my wife will in dark winter nights Enter the church alone and toll the bell. Craw. And ne'er has been alarm'd by any sight Of apparition or unearthly thing? Sexton. Yes; she was once alarm'd. Craw. (eagerly). And what appear'd? Sexton. It was, as nearly as I can remember, Upon a Friday nightâ Craw. (quickly). Ne'er mind the night: what was it that she saw? Sexton. Nay, she herself saw nothing; but the dog That follow'd her bark'd briskly, then stopp'd short, And, with a kind of stifled choking howl, Look'd in her face, then cower'd by her side, Trembling for fear; and then right well she knew Some elrich thing was near her, though its form Was only visible to the poor brute. Craw. You think the dog saw something. Sexton. Certes did he! And had he not been dumb, he could, no doubt, Have told a tale to set our hair on end. Claude (who, during their discourse, has been pacing to and fro impatiently, to sexton). You know not who it was? Sexton. The Lord preserve us, sir! for she saw nothing. Claude. What dost thou mean? Couldst thou not guess, at least, Who 'twas who made request to chant the dirge? Sexton. Ay, ay! the dirge. In truth I cannot say. It was a man I never saw before. Claude (eagerly). Stately, and of a stature somewhat taller Than middle size, of countenance somewhat younger Than middle age? Sexton. No; short, and grave, and ancient, like a priest From foreign parts. [Music sounds again. Craw. Be still and hear the dirge. DIRGE sung by several voices without. Dear spirit! freed from earthy cell, From mortal thraldom freed; The blessed Virgin keep thee well, And thy dread passage speed! Quick be thy progress, gentle soul! Through purifying pain, To the saved Christian's happy goal, Thy Father's bright domain! Beloved on earth! by love redeem'd, Which earthly love transcends, Earth's show,âthe dream that thou hast dream'd, In waking transport ends. Then, bathed in fountains of delight, Mayst thou God's mercy prove, His glory open'd to thy sight, And to thy heart His love! There may thy blessed dwelling be, For ever to endure With those who were on earth like thee, The guileless and the pure! Dear spirit! from thy earthy cell, From mortal thraldom freed, &amp;c. &amp;c. Claude (seeing the light disappear). They are all gone at last: unlock the gate. [The sexton applies the key, but in vain. Canst thou not open it? what is the matter? Sexton. I've brought a key made for another gate; Woe worth my stupid head! Claude. I'll climb the wall. Sexton. Be not so very hasty, please your honour. This key unlocks the southern gate: I pray you To follow me, and you will soon have entrance. Woe worth my stupid head! [Exeunt. SCENE V. The churchyard, near the walls of St. Mungo's church, which occupies the bottom of the stage. A newly covered grave is dimly seen near the front; the stage darkened, but not entirely so; a degree of light, as from a new-risen moon in a cloudy night, showing objects imperfectly. Enter Malcolm, who bends over the grave for some time in silence. Mal. And here beneath this trampled sod she lies, Stiffen'd and cold, and swathed in coffin-weeds, Who, short while since, moved like a gleam of brightness, Lighting each face, and cheering every heart. Oh, Emma, Emma Graham, is this thy place? Dearer than thou a lover's soul ne'er worshipp'd; Fairer than thou a virgin's robe ne'er wrapt; Better than thou a parent's tongue ne'er bless'd. Oh, Emma Graham, the dearest, fairest, best! Pair'd with thee in the dance, this hand in thine, I've led thee through the whirl of mazy transport, And o'er thy chair have hung with wistful ear, Catching thy words like strains of melody, To be with fancy's treasures stored for ever. I've waited near thy portal many an hour, To see thy hasty transit from its steps To the grim gaping coach, that seem'd to swallow, Like a leviathan, its beauteous prey. And now alas! I come to seek thee here! I come to seek thee here, but not to find. This heart, which yearns through its ribb'd fence to break Into the darken'd cell where thou art laid In Nature's thraldom, is from thee divided As by a gulf impassable. Oh, oh! So short a time! such fearful, sad transition! My day is turn'd to night; my youth to age; May life to death be the next welcome change! [Throws himself on the grave in a burst of sorrow. Sweet love, who sleepst beneath, canst thou not hear me? Oh, if thou couldst! Alas! alas! thou canst not! [After a pause, and half-raising himself from the grave. But is it well, and is it holy, thus, On such a sacred spot, to mourn the dead, As lost and perish'd treasure? God forgive me! The silver lamp, with all its rich embossments Of beauteous workmanship, is struck and broken, But is the flame extinguish'd? God forgive me! Forgive a wretched and distracted man, And grant me better thoughts!âThe unclothed spirit In blessed purity hath still existence. Perhaps, in its high state is not unconscious Of what remains behind; perhaps, beholds The very spot. Oh, if she does! her pityâ Her pity, yea, her love now rests upon me. Her spirit, from the body newly freed, Was in my father's house, ere it departed To its celestial home; was it not sympathy? O! Emma, Emma! could I surely know That I was dear to thee, a word,âa token Had been to me a cherish'd, rich possession, Outvaluing all that martial chiefs contend for On their embattled fields.âHa! who approaches? Enter Claude. Come not, I warn thee, near this sacred spot. [Springing up from the ground. Claude. A sacred spot, indeed! but yet to all Who loved in life the dead whom it contains, Free as the house of God. Mal. I say it is not. In this, her first night of the grave, the man Who loved her best when living, claims a right To watch the new-closed tomb, and none beside. Claude. Then yield to me that right, for it is mine; For I have loved her longest,âlong ere thou Hadst look'd upon her face, or heard her name. Mal. 'Tis not the date, but potency of love Which bears account: I say, approach no nearer. Claude. Must I endure such passion? Frantic man! Are we not both in grief smitten to the earth? May we not both weep o'er this sacred spot, Partners in wretchedness? Mal. Away, away! I own no partnership; He who hath spok'n such word hath thereby proved The poorness of his love. Approach no nearer. I'll yield my heart's blood rather than resign This my sad eminence in widow'd sorrow. Claude. Dar'st thou to hinder me? Mal. I dare and will. [They grapple fiercely. Enter Crawford. Craw. (separating them.) For shame! for shame! to hold contention here! Mutual affliction should make friends of foes, Not foes of friends. The grave of one beloved Should be respected e'en as holy ground,â Should have a charm to smother all resentment. Mal. And so it should, and shall.âForgive me, Claude; I have been froward in my wretchedness. Claude. And I, dear Malcolm, was to blame, so suddenly To break upon thy sorrow. Craw. The provost hath despatch'd a messenger Upon our track, who found me out e'en now, Requesting both of you to give your presence On an occasion solemn and important. Claude. What may it be? Craw. Within the late apartment of the dead, Your sister has a duty to perform, Enjoin'd her by the dead. And 'tis her wish That ye should both be present. Claude and Mal. (together). We will obey her shortly. Go before us. [Exeunt Crawford and Malcolm; and Claude, after bending in silence for a few moments over the grave, follows them. SCENE VI. An apartment, the walls of which are lined with oak, and partly hung with arras. Enter a Maid Servant, carrying a lamp and a basket, &amp;c. Maid (speaking as she enters). I trow, when we have burnt this second parcel, The sickly air must needs be purified. But what does all this fuming signify, Since we must die at our appointed time? What dost thou thinkâ (looking round and seeming alarmed) âShe has not follow'd me. I thought she was behind me. Lord preserve us! Here in this ghastly chamber all alone! [Going to the door and calling. Art thou not coming. Marjory? Where art thou? I say, where art thou? I have need of thee. Enter a 2d Maid. 2d maid. Why didst thou call so loud? What is the matter? 1st maid. I thought thou wast behind me: merey on us! A kind of qualm came o'er me, when I look'd On all within this silent dismal room, And to that corner where the death-bed stood,â A sudden qualm came o'er me. 2d maid. Let us be busyâthere's no time to lose; The provost and his daughter will be here Ere we have done our work. [They take gums and dried herbs from the basket, which they set fire to by the lamp, and fumigate the chamber, speaking the while occasionally. 1st maid. The Lord preserve us! 'tis an awful thing. 2d maid. It was a sudden call: so young,âso good! 1st maid. Ay, many a sore heart thinks of her this night. 2d maid. And he, the most of all, that noble gentleman: Lord pardon him for being what he is! 1st maid. And what is that? 2d maid. A rank and Roman papist. 1st maid. The Lord forgive him that, if it be so!â And quickly, too; for this same deadly fever, As I hear say, has seized upon him also. Enter Provost. Provost. That's well, good damsels; you have done your task Right thoroughly: a whelesome, fragrant smell Is floating all about. Where is your master? 1st maid. In his own chamber. When he knows your honour Is in the house, he will attend you presently. 2d maid. And it will do him good to see your honour. Provost. I fear, my joe, the good that I can do him, Or e'en the minister, if he were here, Would be but little. Grief must have its time. Some opiate drug would be to him, I reckon, Worth all my company, and something more. Howbeit, I'll go to him. My good old friend! My heart bleeds for him.âYe have done enough; The ladies are at hand. [Exit by the opposite side. Enter Alice and Marian. Marian. Take hold of me; thy summon'd strength, I fear, Forsakes thee now. [She supports Alice, and they walk slowly to the middle of the room. Ay, thou lookst round, as if in search of something? Alice. They have removed it. Marian. What have they removed? Alice. The bed on which she lay. Oh, woe is me! The last time I was in this chamber, Marian, Becoming suddenly, from some slight cause, A passing sufferer, she laid my head On her own pillow, and her own soft hand Press'd me so gently; I was then the patient, And she the tender nurse. I little thought So short a timeâAlas! my dear, dear friend! Marian. Short time indeed for such a dismal change: I may not chide thy tears. Alice. Here are the virginals on which she play'd; And here's her musie, too. [Taking up a book from the virginals, and opening it. Ah, woe is me! The very tune which last she play'd to me Has open'd to my hand, and 'twixt the leaves The little flower lies press'd which then I gave her! Marian. 'Tis sweet to find it so. Alice. But, oh! how sad! She wasâshe wasâ [Bursting into tears. Well may I weep for her! Marian. Be comforted, dear Alice! she is gone Where neither pain nor woe can touch her more. Alice. I knowâI know it well: but she is gone! She who was fair, and gifted, and beloved: And so beloved!âHad it been heaven's blest will To take me in her stead, tears had been shed, But what had been their woe, compared to this? Marian. Whose woe, dear Alice? Alice. His woeâtheir woe; poor Claude's, and Malcolm's too. Death seizes on the dearest and the best! Marian (embracing her). I will not hear thee say so, gentle Alice. A dearer and a better than thyself 'Twere hard to find. No; nor do I believe That she whom thou lamentest did surpass thee. Alice. Hush! say it not!âI pray thee, say not so: In pitying me thou must not rob the dead. That he preferr'd a creature of such excellence, Took from the wound its sting and bitterness. Thou mayst not wrong the dead! Marian. I will not, then, Alice (looking round). There is the arras that conceals the place: Her awful words are sounding in my ears, Which bade me search. I feel a secret awe! But that her spirit from the earth has ta'enâ As I am well assuredâits final leave, I could believe that she is near me still, To see the very act! [Looking round her fearfully. Marian. Nay, check thy ardent fancy: 'tis not good To let such dismal notions haunt thee soâ Thy father comes, with his afflicted friend. Enter Provost, leading Graham by the hand. [Alice advances affectionately to Graham, who opens his arms to receive her, and she weeps upon his neck, without speaking. She then leads him to a chair, and seats herself upon a stool at his feet, taking his hand in hers, and bending over it, while the Provost and Marian remain in the front. Provost (looking at them). That poor old man! he utters not a word Of sorrow or complaint; and all the more I grieve for him. God help him! in whose hands The hearts of men are kept. Marian. And he is help'd, for he is weeping now. Provost. He did not weep when we for him were weeping, And he will weep when all our tears are dried. âOur two young men, methinks, are long of coming. Marian. But are you sure your messenger hath found them? Provost. I scarcely doubt it. I have those in pay, But little better than the prey they follow, Who are expert in dogging stealthy rogues; And it were strange indeed if artless men Should foil their skill.â And I am rightâI hear their coming steps! Enter Malcolm and Claude. Mal. (after doing silent obeisance to the Provost and Graham, who, with Alice, come forward to meet them, speaks in a low voice to Claude). And here, night after night, in all her beauty, She took her curtain'd rest, and here she died! But that which I expected is not here: Is this the very chamber? Alice (overhearing him, and in a low voice). It is: but what thou lookst for is removed. (Pointing.) Upon that spot it stood. Mal. Yes, thou hast read my thought, most gentle Alice! [Goes to the spot, where he remains in silence, covering his face with his hands. Provost. Shall we not now proceed upon the business For which we are convened? (To Graham.) To you, my ancient friend, I have explain'd it. Malcolm and Claude, know ye why in this chamber Your presence has been solemnly requested. Claude. I guess it well. My sister has inform'd me Of Emma's last request; and I to Malcolm, As we came hither, have repeated it. Provost (to Alice). Now, dearest child! it is for thee to act. [Leads Alice to the bottom of the stage, where, taking aside the arras which covers the wall, a small door is discovered. Claude (to Malcolm, seeing him take a book from a book-case). Why dost thou snatch that book so eagerly? Malcolm. It is the book I praised to her so much A short while since; and see, she has procured it! Claude. Ah! thou mayst well be proud. But how is this? Thy countenance all o' the sudden changed! [Malcolm lets the book drop from his hand, and Claude takes it up eagerly, and opens it, reading. âThe gift of one most dear.ââOf one most dear! Thou didst not give it to her? Mal. No; nor thou! Marian. Hush, hush! words of ungentle rivalry Do ill become this solemn place. Be calm. See! Alice in the cabinet hath found That which the vision'd form so earnestly Directed her to search for. [Alice, returning to the front with a small box in her hands, places it on a table, the rest gathering eagerly round her, and endeavours to open it. Alice. I know this box: alas! I know it well, And many a time have open'd it; but nowâ Provost. Thy hands have lost all power, thou tremblest so. [Taking it from her and from Graham, who attempts to assist her. Nay, friend, thou tremblest also: I will do it. [Opens the box, and takes out a written paper. Omnes. What is it? Provost. Give me time to look upon it. Gra. Some deed or testament. Alas, poor child! Had she prepared for such an early death? Provost. It is no testament. Mal. (impatiently). What is it then? Claude. Nay, father, do not keep us in suspense! Provost. It is a formal contract of betrothment; Vows sworn between herself and Basil Gordon. Gra. That popish cadet of a hostile house To me and mine!âLet mine own eyes examine it. Contracted secretly! to him contracted! But she is in her grave, and IâO God! Grant me with patience to endure Thy chastening! Contracted! married! Provost. Not married; no,âa mutual solemn promise, Made to each other in the sight of heav'n. Thus run the words:â (Reads.) âI, Basil Gordon, will no woman wed But Emma Graham.ââThen follows her engagement:â âI, Emma Graham, will wed no other man Than Basil Gordon: yet will never marry But with consent of my much honour'd father, When he, less prejudiced, shall know and own The worth of him I love.â [Spreading out the paper. This is her writing, as you plainly see; And this is Gordon's, for I know it well. Gra. (beating his breast). This blow! this blow! a Gordon and a papist! Provost. True, he is both: the last, I must confess, No trivial fault. Howbeit he is, in truth, A brave and noble gentleman. Alice. Indeed he is, dear sir. Your gentle Emma Could love no other. Valiant in the field, As frequent foreign records have attested: In private conduct good and honourable; And loving her he loved, as he has done, With ardent, tender constancyâ Mal. Hold! hold! He loved her notâby heav'n he loved her not! When all who ever knew her, drown'd in sorrow, Follow'd her hearse, heâhe alone was absent. Where was he then, I pray? Provost. I'll tell thee where: Stretch'd on a sick-bedâsmitten by the same Most pestilent disease that slew his mistress. Mal. Ha! is it so! (Turning to Claude.) Then we must hold our peace. Claude. And with each other be at peace, dear Malcolm: What is there now of rivalry between us? Mal. Speak not so gently to me, noble Claude! I've been to thee so wayward and unjust, Thy kindness wrings the heart which it should soften. (After a pause.) And all our fond delusion ends in this! We've tack'd our shallow barks for the same course! And the fair mimie isle, like Paradise, Which seem'd to beckon us, was but a bank Of ocean's fog, now into air dissolved! Alice. No; say not beckon'd. She was honourable As she was fair: no wily woman's art Did e'er disgrace her worth:âbelieve me, Malcolm. Mal. Yes; I believe thee, and I bless thee too, Thou best and loveliest friend of one so lovely! Pardon me, dearest Alice! generous Alice! Pardon the hasty error of a word Which had no meaningâno intended meaning To cast one shade of blame on thy dear friend; For henceforth by no other appellation But thy dear friend shall she be named by me. [Turning to Graham. And you, dear sir! look not so sternly sad. Her love outran her duty one short step, But would no farther go, though happiness Was thereby peril'd. Though his house and yours, His creed and yours, were so at variance, still, She might expect his noble qualities Would in the end subdue a father's heart, Who did so fondly love her. Gra. Cease! I am weak, bereft, and desolate,â A poor old man, my pride of wisdom sear'd And ground to dust: what power have I to judge? May God forgive me if I did amiss! Claude (to Provost). Did Gordon see her ere she breathed her last? Provost. He did. The nurse, who was her close attendant, Says, that he came by stealth into her chamber, And with her words and looks of tenderness Exchanged, though near her last extremity. And there he caught the fatal malady. Claude. A happy end for him, if it should prove so. Enter a Servant, who draws the Provost aside. Provost (aside to servant). Thou hast a woeful face! what has befallen? [Servant speaks to him in a whisper. Marian (to Alice). Thy father has received some woeful tidings. Alice. I fear he has; he stands in thoughtful silence. Father, how is't? your thoughts are very sad. Provost. Ay; were this span of earthly being all, 'Twere sad to think how wealth and domination, Man's valour, landed pride, and woman's beauty, When over them the blighting wind hath pass'd, Are turned to vanity, and known no more! [The bell of a neighbouring church tolls five times. Mal. What bell is that? Claude. Some spirit is released from mortal thraldom. Alice. And passing on its way, we humbly hope, To endless happiness. Provost. I trust it is, though stern divines may doubt: 'Tis Basil Gordon's knell! [The bell tolls again at measured intervals, and, after a solemn pause, the curtain drops. THE BRIDE: A DRAMA, IN THREE ACTS. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Rasinga. Samarkoon, his brother-in-law. Juan de Creda, a Spanish physician. Samar, a child, and son of Rasinga. Ehleypoolie, officer of Rasinga. Mihdoony, officer of Rasinga. Officers, domestics, robbers, spearmen, &amp;c.WOMEN Artina, wife of Rasinga, and sister of Samarkoon. Montebesa, mother of Rasinga. The Bride. SabawattÃ©. Nurse, attendants, &amp;c. Scene, in Ceylon. ACT I. SCENE I. Before the castle of Rasinga. Enter Ehleypoolie, meeting Mihdoony and two officers of the chieftain's household. Ehley. Well met, my comrades! I have words for you. Mih. We doubt it not; thou'rt bountiful in words. 1st offi. Thou never wast a niggard of such treasure. Ehley. Ay, but the words which ye shall now receive, Are not the passing ware of daily traffic, But such as in each list'ner's fancy wakes Responding sounds, such, as from twisted shell On sea-beach found, comes to the bended ear Of wand'ring child; sounds strange and full of omen. Mih. What! evil omen? storms and hurricanes? Ehley. Fy on't! A stirring, tinkling, hopeful sound: The ring of scatter'd largess, sweeter far Than pipe, or chord, or chant of forest birds: The sound of mummery and merriment: The soundâ But wherefore stare ye on me thus? List: I will tell you what concerns us all. Mih. Out with it then! for it concerns us all To be no more tormented with thy folly. Ehley. Our Lord Rasinga wills, that we, brave mates, With fifty armed followers and their followers, Shall be in readiness by early dawn, To march in goodly order to the mountains. 1st offi. I like not mountain warfare. 2d offi. No, nor I. Mih. To force our toilsome way through thick rank woods, With bleeding limbs drained by a hundred leeches! Very small leeches which infest many of the woods of Ceylon, and torment travellers. Ehley. Fy, lazy cowards! shrink ye from adventures Which gentle lady, in her palanquin, Will share with you? Mih. A gentle lady, sayst thou? Ehley. Yes, ye dull dolts, I say so.âBrave Rasinga Has with one wife, for a good term of years, (Lulled by some charm of sorcery) been satisfied. It is good time that he, like other chiefs, Should have a first sultana and a second, Or any such arrangement as becomes His age and dignity. So, in gay trim With our arm'd band, we by to-morrow's dawn Must be in readiness.âThese are your orders, Sent by our lord through me. Mih. Who is this honour'd lady of the mountains? Ehley. Caust thou not guess?âThe aged chieftain's daughter, Whose petty hold was sack'd by daring robbers, Not many weeks gone by. He and his daughter Were dragg'd as prisoners from their ruin'd home. In this sad plight, our chief, with Samarkoon, The valiant brother of his present wife, And a good strength of spearmen, met them; charged The bootied spoilers, conquer'd and released Their wretched prey.âAnd ye may well suppose The lady's veil, amidst the strange confusion, Could not be clutch'd so close, but that Rasinga Might see the lovely face it should have cover'd. Mih. O now I understand it; for, methinks, Rasinga had not else brought to his house Another bride to share it with Artina. [Samarkoon, who has entered behind them unperceived, and overheard part of the preceding dialogue, now rushes forward indignantly. Sam. Ye foul-tongued knaves, who so belie your master! What words are these which ye have dared to utter? Ehley. My lord, I crave your pardon; I have utter'd The orders which Rasinga charged me with, That these (pointing to Mihdoony and officers) should straight prepare an armed band To take their way to-morrow for the mountains. Sam. To bring a bride from thence? Speak out, I charge thee, Thou lying knave! Went not thy words thus far? Ehley. If they be true or lying words, I wot not. What may within a guarded palanquin Be from the mountains brought, I may but guess. Perhaps some speaking bird or jabb'ring ape. Sam. (striking him). Take thatâand thatâthou false audacious slave: Dar'st thou to answer me with mockery? [Exit Ehleypoolie sulkily, followed by Mihdoony and officers. Manet Samarkoon. Base sordid reptiles! for some paltry largess And passing revelry, they would right gladly See peace and order and domestic bliss To misery and wild confusion changed. Hateful suggestions! base and vague conjectures, That vulgar minds on slight foundation rear! All false!â And yet they are upon my heart Like the compressure of a coiled boa, Loathly, but irresistible. A bride! It cannot be!âalthough her unveil'd face Was of surprising beautyâOh how lovely! Yet he bestow'd on her but frigid praise, And still continued to repress my ardour, Whene'er I spoke of the fair mountain maid, With silent stern reserve.âIs this like love? It is not natural. Ah! but it is; It is too natural,âdeep subtle nature. How was my idiot soul so far beguiled That I ne'er thought of this? Yes, yes, he loves her! Loves her whom I so wellâso dearly love, That every female image but her own Is from my heart effaced, like curling mists That, rising from the vale, cling for awhile To the tall cliff's brown breast, till the warm sun Dissolves them utterly.â'Tis so; e'en she Whom I have thought of, dreamt of, talk'd of,âay, And talk'd to, though in absence, as a thing Present and conscious of my words, and living, Like the pure air around me, every where. (After a pause.) And he must have this creature of perfection! It shall not be, whatever else may be! As there is blood and manhood in this body, It shall not be! And thou, my gentle sister, Must thy long course of wedded love and honour Come to such end!âThy noble heart will break, When love and friendly confidence are fled. Thou art not form'd to sit within thy bower Like a dress'd idol in its carved alcove, A thing of silk and gems and cold repose: Thy keen but generous natureâShall it be? I'll sooner to the trampling elephant Lay down this mortal frame, than see thee wrong'd. (After a considerable pause.) Nay, nay! I am a madman in my rage. The words of that base varlet may be false. Good Montebesa shall resolve my doubts. Her son confides to her his secret thoughts: To her I'll go, and be relieved from torment, Or know the worst at once. [Exit. SCENE II. The apartment of Montebesa. SabawattÃ© is discovered at work and singing. SONG. The gliding fish that takes his play In shady nook of streamlet cool, Thinks not how waters pass away, And summer dries the pool. The bird beneath his leafy dome, Who trills his carol, loud and clear, Thinks not how soon his verdant home The lightning's breath may sear. Shall I within my bridegroom's bower, With braids of budding roses twined, Look forward to a coming hour When he may prove unkind? The bee reigns in his waxen cell, The chieftain in his stately hold, To-morrow's earthquake,âwho can tell? May both in ruin fold. Enter Montebesa, as the song is concluded. Mont. Did I not hear thee singing, as I came, The song my dear Artina loves to hear? Sab. E'en so, good lady; many a time I sang it When first I was attendant in her bower; Ere, at your own desire, and for my honour, She did resign me to your higher service. Mont. Sing it no more: alas! she thought not then Of its contain'd allusions to a fate Which now abides herself. Sab. No, not her fate; you surely mean not so: She is a happy wife, the only wife Of brave Rasinga, honour'd and beloved. Mont. She was and is as yet his only wife. Sab. As yet his only wife! and think you then She will not so continue? Mont. SabawattÃ©, It grieves me much to tell thee what perforce Must soon be known to all; my son Rasinga Hath set his heart upon a younger bride, Perhaps a fairer too. Sab. (eagerly). No; not a fairer. I'd peril life and limb upon the bet, She is not half so fair, nor half so good. Mont. Be not so hasty.âWhy dost thou regard it As such a grievous thing? She has already Enjoy'd his undivided love much longer Than other dames have done with other lords, And reason teaches she should now give place. Sab. Reason and cruelty sort ill together; A loorie haunting with a spotted pard. Ah! woe the day! Why have you told me this? Mont. Because I would upon your sadden'd brow Print traces that may lead our poor Artina To question thee; and thou, who art her friend, Canst by degrees, with gentle, wise precaution, Reveal to her what she must needs be told. Sab. I cannot: put not such a task on me, I do implore your goodness!âNo, I cannot. Mont. Hush, hush! I hear the footsteps of a man, But not Rasinga.âIt is Samarkoon; I know his rapid tread.âBe wise; be silent; For he awhile must live in ignorance. Enter Samarkoon, and SabawattÃ© retires to some distance. A happy morning to you, youthful kinsman! Sam. As it may prove, good lady: happy morning Oft leads to woeful eve, ay, woeful noon. Mont. These are strange sombre words; what is the matter? Why dost thou look both sorrowful and stern? Sam. I have good cause, if that which I have heard Be aught but a malignant, hateful tale, On mere conjecture founded. Answer me, If thou knowst nothing of a num'rous train In preparation, by Rasinga's orders, To fetch home to his house a fair young bride? There's no such thing.âSpeakâspeak! I will believe thee; For if to thee unknown, there's no such thing.â [A pause, he looking inquisitively in her face. Thou dost not speak; thou dost not answer me; There's trouble in thine eye.âA with'ring curse Light on his heartless heart, if this be true! Mont. Brave Samarkoon! thou art not wise, so fiercely To question me of that which well may be Without my knowledge;âthat which, if it be, Nor thou nor I have any power to alter. Sam. Which if it be! that if betrays an answer; A shameful answer, shunning open words. Dear, dear Artina! thou hast climb'd already The sunny side of Doombra's mountain ridge , A high mountainous ridge in Ceylon, where the one side is sunny, clear, and warm, the other cloudy, wet, and cold. And now with one short step must pass the bounds Dividing ardent heat from chilling clouds With drenching mist surcharged. So suddenly To bring this change upon her! Cruel craft! He knows that it will break her tender heart, And serve his fatal purpose. Mont. Frantic man! Thou art unjust, ungenerous, unwise; For should Rasingaâno uncommon act, Take to his princely bower a second bride, Would not Artina still be held in honour, Her children cherish'd, and their rank secured? Sam. Such honour as unfeeling worldlings give To fall'n deserted merit, she will have; And such security as should-be heirs, Who stand i' the way of younger, petted minions, Find in the house of an estranged sire, Her children will receive. Alas, alas! The very bonds of soul-devoted love, That did so long entwine a husband's heart, For her own life the cord of execution Will surely prove. Detested cruelty! But is it so? My head is all confusion, My heart all fire;âI know not what thou saidst. Mont. Indeed, young kinsman, thou art now unfit To hold discourse on such a wayward subject. She whom thou lovst so dearly as a brother, I as a mother do most truly love. Let this suffice thee, and retire awhile, For I expect Artina, and 'tis meet She be not now o'erwhelm'd with thy distress. Ha! she is here already; tripping lightly With sparkling eyes, like any happy child, Who bears away the new-robb'd rock-bird's spoil. Enter Artina, gaily, with an embroidered scarf of many colours in her hand, and running up to Montebesa. Art. Dear mother, look at this! such tints, such flowers! The spirits of the Peak have done this work; Not hands of flesh and blood. Nay, look more closely. And thou too, Samarkoon. How cam'st thou here? I pray you both admire the beauteous giftâ Rasinga's giftâwhich I have just received. Sam. (eagerly). Received from his own hand, so lately too? Art. E'en now. But did I say, from his own hand? He sent it to me, the capricious man! Ay, and another present, some days since, Was also sent. Ay, so it was indeed. Sam. Was he not wont to bring such gifts himself? Art. With what a face of gravity thou askst This most important question! Never mind: I can devise a means to be revenged For all this seeming lack of courtesy. Mont. Devise a means to be revenged! and how? Art. I'll dress old nurse as my ambassadress, With robe, and veil, and pall majestical, And she shall thank him in a tiresome speech, (He hates her formal prosing)âthat I trow, Will cure him of such princely modes of sending His gifts to me. But ye are wondrous grave. What ails thee, brother? Speak, good Montebesa; I fear he is not well. Mont. He is not very well. Art. (taking his hand affectionately). Indeed he is not. Sam. (turning away his face). A passing fit of fever has disturb'd me, But mind it not, Artina. Art. Nay, nay, but I will mind it, gentle brother. And I have learnt this morning cheering news, Good news for thee and all sick folk beside. Mont. We want good news; what is it thou hast heard? Art. De Creda, who, by physic magical, Did cure Rasinga of his fearful malady, When at the point of death, is just arrived. Where he hath been these two long years and more, There's not a creature knows. Perhaps i' the moon, If magic knows the way to climb so high. Mont. Perhaps in his own land. Art. Ay, certes, Europe is a wondrous kingdom, And well worth visiting, which sends forth men So gifted and so good. Sam. I pray thee say not men, but only man. Hath it e'er sent another like to him? Yet wherefore came he to these happier regions With such a wicked crew? Art. Nay, blame him not: His fate hath been disastrous and sad, As I have heard him say; and, woe is me! Misfortune is not dainty in associates. Sam. Associates! Solitude, in trackless deserts, Where locusts, ants, and lizards poorly thrive,â On the bare summit of a rugged peak, Where birds of prey in dusky circles wing The troubled air with loud and clam'rous din, Were to an honest heart endurable, Rather than such associates. Art. Ha! does this rouse thee so? Yet, ne'ertheless, I'll send for him, and he will make thee well. Sam. I'm well if thou art so, my gentle sister. Art. And I am so; how canst thou doubt it, brother, Being so loving and so well beloved. Sam. O yes! thou art indeed beloved most dearly, Both thee and thine, and so shall ever be, While life gives motion to thy brother's heart. Art. A brother's heart!âHow so? there is a meaning,â A meaning and a mystery in this. Tears, too, are on my hand, dropt from thine eyes;â O, speak, and tell the worst! Sam. I may not now. I pray thee, let me go; I cannot speak. [Breaks from her and exit. Then SabawattÃ© comes forward and takes hold of her robe with an action of soothing tenderness. Art. (to SabawattÃ©). Dost thou, too, look on me with pity? Speak; I charge thee speak, and tell the fearful cause, Since no one else will do it. Mont. My dear Artina, thou shalt know the truth, Which can no longer be conceal'd; but listen, Listen with patience to the previous story, And thou wilt see how fated, strange events Have caused within Rasinga's noble heart, E'en he who has so long and dearly loved thee, A growing possibility of change. Art. If he is changed, why should I know the rest? All is comprised in this. [With actions of despair. Mont. Nay, do not wring thy hands, but listen to me. Sit on this seat and call up strength to hear me. Thou giv'st no heed to me; thou dost not hear. Art. (in a low voice, after a pause). I'm faint and very cold; mine ears ring strangely; But I will try to do whate'er thou wilt. [After another pause. There is a story then: I'll hear it now. Mont. Rasinga, as thou knowst, did, short while since, A mountain chief and his fair daughter rescue From ruffian robbers. In its youthful charms He saw the virgin's unveiled face. Alas! A sight so rare he could not see unmoved. Restless and troubled, like a stricken wretch Whom sorcery possesses, for awhile He strove against his passion, but at length Nature gave way; and thou mayst guess what follows. Art. What follows! What has followed? Mont. Our gates must soon receive this youthful bride; And thou, dear daughter, must prepare thyself To bear some natural change. [Artina faints away in the arms of SabawattÃ©. Sab. I knew it would be so! Oh, my dear mistress! These cruel words have dealt the fatal blow. Mont. Be not afraid of this infirmity, Which, though it seems appalling, brings relief, E'en like NiwanÃ©, when the virtuous soul The final reward of the virtuous after death, according to the Boodhoo religion, is perfect rest or insensibility; and that state, or the region in which it takes place, is called NiwanÃ©. Hath run, through many a change, its troubled course. Let us remove her gently to my couch! [Exeunt. SCENE III. The apartments of Rasinga. He enters, followed by Ehleypoolie and Mihdoony, and is speaking as he enters. Ras. (to Ehleypoolie). Thou hast done well. Ehley. I am not given to boasting, Yet I must say all things are so arranged, That never bride's array, on such short notice, Was better order'd, or for gallant show, Or for security. Ras. 'Tis rich and splendid? Ehley. Our palanquin, with all its colour'd streamers, Will shine above the guards' encircling heads, Like any crested mancka, proudly perch'd Upon the summit of her bushy knoll. Ras. And have ye pioneers to clear its way? Ehley. Ay, pioneers who through a tangled thicket Make room as quickly as the supple trunk Of a wild elephant; whilst forest birds, From their rent haunts dislodged, fly up and wheel In mazy circles, raising clam'rous cries, And casting noon-day shadows, like a cloud, On the green woods beneath. Mih. In truth, my lord, he makes it well appear He is not given to boasting. Ras. (smiling). Not a whit! As meek and modest as a Padur's child. And having done so much for show and speed, Good Ehleypoolie, I will take for granted The chiefest point of all, security, Has not been overlook'd; for mountain robbers May yet be lurking near some narrow pass. Ehley. Well, let them lurk, and burst upon us too; 'Twill be as though a troop of mowing monkeys, With antic mimic motions of defiance, Should front the brinded tiger and his brood. Full soon, I trow, their hinder parts they turn, Lank and unseemly, to the enemy, In scamp'ring haste, to gain the nearest shelter. It were good sport if they should dare to stand. Mih. You see, my lord, he is in all things perfect. Ras. I see it plainly. Thanks for all thy pains, Brave Ehleypoolie. Ehley. Shall we take with us The pipes and doulas Doulas, a kind of drums, beat on one end by the hand and on the other with a stick. that have hung so long In the recess of Dame Artina's garden? Of all your instruments there are not any That sound so loud and clear. Ras. (sternly). No, no! I charge thee, Let nothing there be changed. Thy witless words Have struck upon my heart a dismal note, Depressing all its life and buoyancy. Alas! my joy is like the shimm'ring brightness Of moving waves, touch'd by the half-risen moon, Tracing her narrow pathway on the deep: Between each brighten'd ridge black darkness lies, le far on either side, the wat'ry waste Spreads dim, and vague, and cheerless. Mih. If such thy thoughts, dost thou repent thy purpose? Ras. Not so; there's ecstacy in those bright gleams; Ay, and though cross'd with darkness black as midnight, I will enjoy this momentary radiance. Enter a Slave, in haste. What brings thee here with such a staring face? Slave. The lady's coming; she is close at hand. Ras. Ha! from her father's house, unsent for, come? Slave. No, not that lady, sir; it is Artina. Ras. (much disturbed). I thought my mother would have spared me this. Is Montebesa with her? Slave. No, my lord; She has her children with her. Ras. Wretched moment! The sight of them will change my strength to cowardice: What shall I do? Ehley. I'll quickly run and say that you are busy, And cannot see her. Ras. (pulling Ehleypoolie back as he is about to go out). Restrain thy heartless zeal; it is most odious. Shall she be so debarr'd from entrance here, Whose presence was a blessing and a grace! Enter Artina, leading her youngest child, and followed by Samar, leading his little sister. Rasinga hastens to meet her, and leads her in silence to the principal seat, at the same time motioning to Ehleypoolie and Mihdoony to withdraw, who immediately leave the apartment. Here, take this seat, Artina. Art. No, my lord; I come not here to sit; I come to kneel, As now beseems a scorn'd forsaken wife, Who pleads with strong affection for her children: Who pleads in painful memory of love Which thou for many years hast lavish'd on her, Till, in the gladness of a foolish heart, She did believe that she was worthy of it. Ras. Yes, dear Artina, thou wast worthy of it! Thou wast, and art, and shalt be loved and honour'd While there is life within Rasinga's bosom. Why didst thou think it could be otherwise, Although another mate within my house May take her place, to be with thee associated, As younger sister with an elder born? Such union is in many houses found. Art. I have no skill in wordsâno power to reason: How others live I little care to know: But this I feel, there is no life for me, No love, no honour, if thy alter'd heart Hath put me from it for another mate. Oh, woe is me! these children on thy knees, That were so oft caress'd, so dearly cherish'd, Must then divide thy love with younger fav'rites, Of younger mother born? Alas! alas! Small will the portion be that falls to them. Ras. Nay, say not so, Artina; say not so. Art. I know it well. Thou thinkest now, belike, That thou wilt love them still; but ah! too soon They'll be as things who do but haunt thy house, Lacking another home, uncheer'd, uncared for And who will heed their wants, will soothe their sorrow, When their poor mother moulders in the grave, And her vex'd spirit, in some other form, Is on its way to gain the dreamless sleep? Kneel, Samar, kneel! thy father loved thee first, In our first happy days.âWilt thou not, boy? Why dost thou stand so sullen and so still? Sam. Ne loves us not. Art. Nay, nay, but he will love us. Down on thy knees! up with thy clasped hands! Rasinga, O Rasinga! did I think So to implore thy pityâI and mine So to implore thy pity, and in vain! [Sinks on the ground exhausted with agitation. Ras. (raising her gently in his arms). Dearest Artina! still most dear to me: Thy passionate affections waste thy strength; Let me support thee to another chamber, More fitting for retirement and for rest. Come also, children.âCome, my little playmates! Sam. We're not thy playmates now. Ras. What dost thou say? Sam. Thou dost not speak and smile and sport with us As thou wast wont: we're not thy playmates now. Ras. Thou art a fearless knave to tell me so. [Exeunt, Artina leaning on her husband, and the children following. SCENE IV. A retired grove near the castle of Rasinga. Enter Samarkoon and a forest freebooter. Sam. Now, stop we here; in this sequester'd spot, We may with freedom commune on the purpose For which I would engage thy speedy aid. Thou knowest who I am; and dost remember Where, how, and when I last encounter'd thee? Free. I do, my lord; but though thou findst me thus, Alone and slightly arm'd, be well assured I will defend my life and liberty, Against thyself (looking suspiciously around) or any ambush'd band, To the last bloody push of desperation. Sam. I know thou wilt; it is thy desp'rate prowess That makes me now, all robber as thou art, And lurking here disguised, as well I guess, For no good end,âto seek thy amity. Free. My amity! the noble Samarkoonâ A chief of rank, and brother of Rasinga! Sam. Strong passion by strong provocation roused, Is not a scrup'lous chooser of its means. How many of these armed desperadoes, From whose fell hands we did so lately rescue That petty chieftain and his child, couldst thou Within short time assemble? Free. Few remain Of those who once, at sound of my shrill horn, With spear and bow in hand, and quiver'd back The deadly arrows bearing, issued forth From cave or woody jungle, fierce but stealthy, Like glaring, tawny pards,âfew, few remain. Sam. But some remain? Free. Ay, some. Sam. And they are brave? Free. No braver bandits e'er in deadly strife With man or tiger grappled. Sam. Enough! hie quickly to thy forest haunts, And near the narrow pass where ye sustain'd The onset of Rasinga, wait my coming With all the armed mates thou canst assemble; And there I'll join thee with a trusty band. Do this, and thou shalt be rewarded richly. Free. I will; nor do I doubt the recompense From such a noble chief will be most bountiful. Sam. Tis well; be speedy, secret, faithful,âbrave, I need not say. So let us separate, Nor stay for further parley; time is precious. Free. I will but go to leave an offering At the WiharÃ© yonder; then with speed Wend to our woods.âBut wherefore smilest thou? Sam. Dost thou regard such duties? Free. Ay, good sooth! Who has more need of favour from the gods Than he who leads a life of lawless peril? [Exit. Sam. (exultingly). Ay, now, Rasinga, set thy costly chamber, While poor Artina sighs and weeps unheeded, In gallant order for thy fair new bride! Another bridegroom and another chamber Abide her which thou little thinkest of. [Exit. ACT II. SCENE I. The castle of Samarkoon. Loud shouting heard without. Enter several Domestics in confusion. 1st dom. What shouts are those? do enemies approach? What can we do in our brave master's absence? 2d dom. Ha! hear it now! it is no enemy; It is our lord himself; I know the sound. And lo! his messenger arrived with tidings. Enter a Messenger. What are thy news? Mess. Right joyful news, I warrant. Our master brings a bride, by conquest won, To be the bliss and sunshine of his house; A bride fair as the goddess, bright PatinÃ©. 1st dom. Most unexpected tidings; won by conquest? 2d dom. With whom has he been fighting for such prize? Mess. Fy, fy, despatch and make such preparation As may be fitting for a bride's reception: There is no time for telling stories now. Despatch, I say; do ye not hear them nearer? They are not many furlongs from the gate. [Exeunt in haste, different ways. SCENE II. The hall or principal room of the castle. Enter Samarkoon, leading in a lady covered with a veil, and followed by two female attendants; then a band of musicians and a train of armed men, with Ehleypoolie and several of his soldiers as prisoners. A nuptial chaunt or song is struck up. SONG. Open wide the frontal gate, The lady comes in bridal state; Than wafted spices sweeter far, Brighter than the morning star; Modest as the lily wild, Gentle as a nurse's child. A lovelier prize, of prouder boast, Never chieftain's threshold corss'd. Like the beams of early day, Her eyes' quick flashes brightly play; Brightly play and gladden all On whom their kindly glances fall. Her lips in smiling weave a charm To keep the peopled house from harm. In happy moment is she come To bless a noble chieftain's home. Happy be her dwelling here, Many a day and month and year! Happy as the nested dove In her fruitful ark of love! Happy in her tented screen! Happy in her garden green! Thus we welcome, one and all, The lady to her chieftain's hall. Sam. I give you all large thanks, my valiant warriors, For the good service ye have done to me Upon this day of happy fate. Ere long, This gentle lady too, I trust, will thank you, Albeit her present tears and alter'd state Have made her shrink and droop in cheerless silence. An ample recompense ye well have won, That shall not with a sparing hand be dealt. Meantime, partake our cheer and revelry; And let the wounded have attendance due; Let sorcery and medicine combine To mitigate their pain. (Turning to the prisoners.) Nay, Ehleypoolie, Why from beneath those low'ring brows dost thou Cast on the ground such wan and wither'd looks? Thy martial enterprise fell somewhat short Of thy predictions and thy master's pleasure; But thou and all thy band have bravely fought, And no disgrace is coupled with your failure. Ehley. Had not my amulets from this right arm Been at the onset torn, e'en ambush'd foes Had not so master'd us. Sam. Well, be it so; good amulets hereafter Thou mayst secure, and fight with better luck. Ehley. Ay, luck was on your side, good sooth! such luck As fiends and magic give. Another timeâ Sam. What thou wilt do another time, at present We have no time to learn. (To his followers generally.) Go where cool sparkling cups and sav'ry viands Will wasted strength recruit, and cheer your hearts. Ere long I'll join you at the board, and fill A hearty cup of health and thanks to all. [Exeunt all but Samarkoon, the bride, and her female attendants. And now, dear maid, thou pearl and gem of beauty, The prize for which this bloody fray was fought, Wilt thou forgive a youthful lover's boldness, And the rude outrage by his love committed? Wilt thou not speak to me? Bride. What can I say? I was the destined bride of great Rasinga; My father told me so. Sam. But did thy heartâ Did thine own heart, sweet maid, repeat the tale? And did it say to thee, âThe elder chieftain Is he whom I approve; his younger rival Unworthy of my choice? Bride. My choice! a modest virgin hath no choice. That I have seen you both; that both have seen My unveil'd face, alas! is my dishonour, Albeit most innocent of such exposure. Sam. Say not dishonour; innocence is honour; And thou art innocent and therefore honourable, Though every slave and spearman of our train Had gazed upon thy face. The morning star Receives no taint for that a thousand eyes, All heavenward turn'd, admire its lovely brightness. Let me again look in thy dark soft eyes, And read my pardon in one beamy smile. [Attempting to draw aside her veil, while she gathers it the closer. Bride. Forbear, forbear! this is indignity. Sam. And this, dear maid, is childish bashfulness. [The upper fastening of the veil gives way and falls over her hand. And look, the silly fence drops of itself; An omen of good fortune to my love. Oh! while those eyes are fix'd upon the ground, Defended from too ardent admiration, With patience hear my suit.âTwo rival chiefs Have look'd upon thy face, and thou perforce Must choose or one or other for thy husband. Rasinga, in his rich and noble mansion, Hath years already pass'd in wedded love; And is the husband of a virtuous dame, Whose faithful heart, in giving place to thee, Will be asunder torn. My house is humble; No gay and costly treasures deck its walls; But I am young, unmarried, and my heart Shall be thine own, whilst thou reignst mistress here, As shares the lion's mate his forest cave, In proud equality. Thou smilst at this; And it doth please thy fancy;âyea, a tear Falls on that smiling cheek; yes, thou art mine. Bride. Too quickly dost thou scan a passing thought. Sam. Thanks, thanks! O take my thanks for such dear words! And speak them yet again with that sweet voice Which makes my heart dance in its glowing cell. 1st att. (advancing to Samarkoon). My lady is forspent with all this coil; She has much need of quiet rest. I pray, On her behalf, let this be granted to her. Bride (to 1st att.). I thank thee, nurse! (To Samarkoon.) My lord, I would retire. Sam. I will retire, or do whate'er thou wilt. Thy word or wish commands myself and mine. [Exit. 1st att. Thyself and thine! a mighty rich dominion! Alack, alack-a-day, the woeful change! This rude unfurnish'd tower for the fair mansion Of great Rasinga! Evil was the hour When those fell demons stopped us on our way. Bride. O, say not so! in great Rasinga's house A noble wife already holds her state, And here I shall have no divided pleasure. 1st att. Divided! Doth an elder faded wife In love, in honour, or in riches share Like portion with a youthful beauty? No! She doth herself become the flatt'ring subject Of her through whom the husband's favours flow; And thereby doth increase her rival's power Her state and dignity. Thou art a simple child, and hast no sense Of happiness or honour. Woe the day, When those fell demons stopp'd our high career! Bride. But for my father's anger, and the blood Which has been shed in this untoward fray, The day were one of joy and not of woe, In my poor estimation. 1st att. Poor, indeed! 2d att. (advancing). Fy, nurse! how canst thou so forget thyself? Thy words are rude; my lady is offended. 1st att. Who would not, so provoked, forget herself? Ah! the rich treasures of Rasinga's palace! His gaudy slaves, his splendid palanquins! They have pass'd from us like a mummer's show, Seen for an hour and gone. Enter a female domestic. Dom. My master bids me say, the lady's chamber Is now in readiness. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The court of the castle. Enter two domestics, meeting. 1st dom. The merry revelry continues still As if but just begun, though Samarkoon Reminds them anxiously, that preparation For the defence of this neglected hold, Is pressing matter of necessity. 2d dom. Those glutton bandits will not leave a board, On which good viands smoke or wine-cups sparkle, For all the words of threat'ning or entreaty, That mortal tongue can utter. Enter a third domestic, in great alarm. 3d dom. Where is our master? 1st dom. What alarms thee so? 3d dom. There is a power of armed men advancing. I saw their dark heads winding through the pass Above the bushes shown; a lengthen'd line, Two hundred strong, I guess. 1st dom. It is Rasinga. 2d dom. Ring the larum bell, And rouse those drunken thieves from their debauch. 3d dom. But I must find our master; where is he? 1st dom. He was i' th' inner court some minutes since. [The alarum bell has rang, and many people is confusion cross the stage as the scene closes. SCENE IV. An open space before the gate of the castle; armed men are discovered on the walls. Enter Rasinga and his force. Ras. (to those on the walls). Where is that villain whom ye call your lord? Let him appear, and say, why, like a robber,â A reckless, lawless traitor, he hath dared My servants to attack, my bride to capture, And do most foul dishonour to my state. Am I a driv'ling fool,âa nerveless stripling,â A widow'd Rany, propping infants' rights, That thus he reckons with impunity To pour on me such outrage? Enter Samarkoon above, and stands on the wall over the gate. Sam. Rasinga, thou art robb'd and thou art wrong'd, And hast good cause to utter stormy words. Ras. Ay, and good cause to back those stormy words With stormy blows, which soon shall force that gate, Make desp'rate entrance through the rifted walls, And leave within your paltry tower, of all Who dare oppose my arms, no living thing, Unless thou do restore the mountain beauty, And all the spoil thou hast so basely won. Sam. Though I have dared to wrong thee, brave Rasinga, I've done it in the heat and agony Of passions that, within a generous breast, Are irresistible, and, be assured, With no weak calculations of impunity. The living treasure I have robb'd thee of I will defend to the extremity Of desp'rate effort, e'en in this poor hold, Mann'd as it is.âI well might speak to thee Of equal claims to that fair beauty's favour; Of secret love; of strong fraternal sympathy With her whose honour'd name I will not utter; But that were vain. Ras. Vain as a sea-bird's screams, To check the wind-scourg'd ocean's rising billows: So far thou speakest wisely.âStern defiance I cast to thee; receive it as thou mayst, Audacious traitor! Sam. And I to thee do cast it back again With words and heart as dauntless as thine own. Ras. (to his followers). Here ends our waste of breath and waste of time. On, pioneers, and let your pond'rous mallets Break down the gate! To it, my valiant bowmen! Discharge a shower of arrows on that wall, And clear it of yon load of miscreant life. [Rasinga' s followers raise a shout, which is answered by one equally loud from the adverse party, and the attack commences. After great efforts of attack and defence, the gate is at last forced, and Rasinga, with his force, enters the castle. The scene then closes. SCENE V. A wild mountain pass, with a bridge swung from one high perpendicular rock to another. The course of a small stream, with its herby margin, seen beneath. Martial music is heard, and a military procession seen at some distance, winding among the rocks, and at length crossing the bridge. Then come the followers of Rasinga in triumph, leading Samarkoon in chains, followed by men bearing a palanquin, and in the rear Rasinga himself, with his principal officers. As he is on the middle of the bridge, Juan De Creda enters below, and calls to him with a loud voice. Juan. Rasinga, ho! thou noble chief, Rasinga! Ras. (above). Who calls on me? Juan. Dost thou not know my voice? Ras. Juan de Creda, is it thou indeed? Why do I find thee here? Juan. Because the power, that rules o'er heaven and earth, Hath laid its high commission on my soul Here to arrest thee on thy fatal way. Ras. What mean such solemn words? Juan. Descend to me, and thou shalt know their meaning. [Rasinga crosses the bridge and re-appears below. Ras. I have obey'd thee, and do bid thee welcome To this fair land again.âBut thou shrinkst back, Casting on me looks of upbraiding sorrow: With thee I may not lordly rights assert; What is thy pleasure? Juan. Is he, the prisoner now led before thee, Loaded with chains, like a vile criminal, Is he the noble Samarkoon, thy brother? Ras. Miscall not by such names that fetter'd villain: He, who once wore them with fair specious seeming, Is now extinct to honour, base and treacherous. The vilest carcass, trampled under foot By pond'rous elephant, for lawless deeds, Was ne'er inhabited by soul more worthless. Juan. Thy bitter wrath ascribes to his offence A ten-fold turpitude. Suspect thy judgment. When two days' thought has communed with thy conscience, Of all the strong temptations that beset Unwary youth by potent passions urged, Thou wilt not pass on him so harsh a censure. Ras. When two days' thought! If that he be alive, And wear a human semblance two days hence, In the fell serpent's folds, the tiger's paws, Or earthquake's pitchy crevice, with like speed, Be my abhorred end! Juan. Hold, hold, Rasinga! The God, in whose high keeping is the fate Of every mortal man, or prince, or slave, Hath this behest declared,âthat sinful man Should pardon grant to a repentant brother; Yea, more than this,âto his repentant enemies. So God commands: and wilt thou prove rebellious? Ras. Ha! hast thou been in heaven since last we met, To bring from hence this precious message? Truly Thou speakst as if thou hadst. Juan. No, I have found it in my native land, Within the pages of a sacred book, Which I and my compatriots do believe Contains the high revealed will of God. Ras. Ha! then those Europeans, whom the sea Hath cast like fiends upon our eastern shores, To wrong and spoil and steep the soil with blood, Are not compatriots of thy book-taught land. What! dost thou cast thine eyes upon the ground? The stain of rushing blood is on thy cheek. If they be so, methinks they have obey'd That heavenly message sparingly.âGo to! Tell me no more of this fantastic virtue,â This mercy and forgiveness. E'en a woman, A child, a simpleton would laugh to scorn Such strange unnatural duty. Juan. Call it not so till I have told thee furtherâ [Taking his hand. Ras. Detain me not. But that to thee I owe My life from fatal sickness rescued,âdearly, Full dearly shouldst thou pay for such presumption. Let go thy hold! Juan. I will not till thou promise, Before thy vengeful purpose be effected, To see me once again. Ras. I promise then, thou proud and dauntless stranger; For benefits are traced in my remembrance With lines as ineffaceable as wrongs. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The house of Montebesa; who enters, meeting a servant from the opposite side. Mont. What com'st thou to impart? thy busy face Is full of mingled meaning, grief and gladness. Serv. My Lord Rasinga, madam, is returned,â Return'd victorious; and the fair young bride Again is rescued by his matchless valour. Mont. All this is good; hast thou no more to tell? Serv. Alas! I have; for, by his spearmen guarded, Loaded with chains, most rueful to behold, Comes Samarkoon. For now it doth appear, That he, enleagued with robbers, was the spoiler, Who beat the gallant train of Ehleypoolie, And bore away their prize. Mont. Oh, this is dreadful! Clouds o'erlapping clouds Are weaving o'er our house an evil woof,â A fearful canopy. It was to us That ominous sign was sent, but few days past, When Boodhoo's rays, beneath the noon's blue dome Bright rays which appear in the middle of the day, surpassing the brightness of the sun, and are supposed to foretel evil. With shiv'ring motion gleam'd in streaky brightness, Surpassing mid-day splendour. Woe is me! I saw it not unmoved; but little thought, Ah! little thought of misery like this. Enter Juan de Creda. Welcome, De Creda; thou in hour of need Art ever wise and helpful. Dost thou know Of this most strange event? Of Samarkoon As lawless spoiler by Rasinga conquer'd, And ledâ Juan. I do; and come to entreat thee, lady, That thou with thy enchafed and vengeful son Mayst use a mother's influence to save him. Mont. Entreaties are not wanted, good De Creda, For herein I am zealous as thyself. Juan. He must not die. Mont. Nor shall, if I can save him. Juan. Then let us meet Rasinga, as he passes, Ere he can reach the shelter of his chamber, Where men are wont to cherish moody wrath; And we will so beset him with our prayers, That we shall move his soul, if it be possible. The fair Artina too must come with us To beg her brother's life. Mont. Yes, be it so; but first let us apprise her, And do it warily, lest sudden grief O'erwhelm her totally. Juan. That will be necessary. And, lady, let us find her instantly; We have no time to spare. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. A gallery or passage leading to Rasinga' s chamber. Enter Rasinga, speaking to an officer, who follows him. Ras. And let his dungeon be secured to the utmost With bolts and bars; and set a double guard To watch the entry. Make it sure, I say: For if thy prisoner escape, thy life Shall pay the forfeit. This thou knowest well, Therefore be vigilant. [Exit officer. The very blood is boiling in my veins, Whilst the audacious braver of my rights, My arms, my honour, e'en within a dungeon And manacled with iron, breathes vital air. Enter Montebesa by the farther end of the gallery, followed by Artina and Juan de Creda, who remain without advancing further, whilst she approaches her son with an air of dignity. Mont. Rasinga, let a mother, who rejoices In every victory thy arms achieve, Be it o'er foreign, yea, or kindred foe, Greet thee right heartily! Ras. I thank you, lady! Mont. But that my pride in thee may be unmix'd With any sense of aught to taint thy glory, Grant me a boon that will enhance thy triumph, And make me say, with full, elated heart, Rasinga is my son. Ras. Name it; whate'er a man may grant is thine. Mont. The life of Samarkoon: that is my boon. Ras. The life of Samarkoon! then thou dost ask The foul disgrace and ruin of thy son. Mont. Not so; for thine own peace and future weal, I do adjure thee to be merciful. Ras. And wouldst thou see the son whom thou didst bear, An unrevenged, despised, derided man? And have I gain'd from thee and my brave sire This manly stature and these hands of strength To play an idiot's or a woman's part? If such indeed be Montebesa's wish, Poor slight-boned, puny, shambling drivellers, Or sickly maidens, should have been the offspring Produced by her to mock a noble house. Mont. O say not so! there will be no dishonour. Ras. What! no dishonour in the mocking lips, And pointing fingers of the meanest peasant, Who would his whetted blade sheath in the heart Of his own mother's son for half the wrong,â Ay, half the wrong which that audacious traitor Has done to me! Cease, lady; say no more: I cannot henceforth live in ignominy; Therefore, good sooth! I cannot grant your boon. Art. (rushing forward and catching hold of his hand and his garments). Dear, dear Rasinga! wilt thou make my life One load of wretchedness? Thou'st cast me off,â I who so loved thee and love thee still,â Thou'st cast me off, and I will meekly bear it. Then, wilt thou not make some amends to me, In a saved brother's life, for all the tears, The bitter tears and anguish this has caused me? Ras. (shaking her off). Thy plea is also vain; away, away! Thy tears and anguish had been better comforted, Had he a more successful spoiler proved. [Turning fiercely on Juan de Creda, who now advances. Ha! thou too art upon me! Thou whose kindred And colleagues are of those who read good lore, And speak like holy saints, and act like fiends. By my brave father's soul, where'er it be, Thou art a seemly suitor for such favour! [Bursts away from them and exit. Art. De Creda, good De Creda, dear De Creda! Wilt thou not follow him? Juan. Not now; it were in vain; I might as well, While wreck of unroof'd cots and forest boughs, And sand and rooted herbage whirl aloft, Dark'ning the sky, bid the outrageous hurricane Spare a rock-cresting palm. But yet despair not; I'll find a season. Let me lead thee hence. Mont. I fear the fierceness of his untamed spirit Will never yield until it be too late; And then he will, in brooding, vain repentance, The more relentless be to future criminals; As though the death of one he should have spared Made it injustice e'er to spare another. I know his dangerous nature all too well. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. A prison. Samarkoon is discovered in chains; a lamp burning on the ground near him, and a pitcher of water by it. Sam. And now the close of this my present being, With all its hopes, its happiness, and pain. Is near at hand,âa violent bloody close, Perhaps with added torture and disgrace. Oh, Kattragam, terrific deity! The name of the Cingalese Spirit of Evil, or God of Destruction. Thy stern decrees have compass'd all this misery. Short, turbulent, and changeful, and disastrous, Hath been this stage of my existence. What, When this is past, abides me in my progress To the still blessing of unvision'd rest, Who may imagine or conjecture?âBlessing! Alas! it is a dull unjoyous blessing To lose, with consciousness of pain, all consciousness: The pleasure of sweet sounds and beauteous sights. Bride, sister, friends,âall vanish'd and extinct, That stilly, endless rest may be unbroken. Oh, oh! he is a miserable man, Who covets such a blessing!âHush, bad thoughts! Rebellious, faithless thoughts! My misery Is deep enough to make e'en this a blessing. Enter Artina. It cannot be! is it some fantasy? Who and what art thou? Art. (approaching him softly). The thing I seem; thy miserable sister. Sam. My gen'rous, loving sister, in her love Running such fearful risk to comfort me. Art. Nay, more than this, dear brother; more than comfort; I come to set thee free. Sam. Has he relented? Art. No, no! Rasinga is most ruthless. I, By means of this (showing a signet), which, in our better days, It was my privilege to use at will, Have pass'd the guards, and may a short while hence By the same means return,âreturn in safety. Meantime let me undo those galling fetters; I've brought fit tools, and thou shalt teach me how. Sam. But canst thou think the guards will let thee pass, E'en with thy signet, leading a companion? It cannot be; thou dost deceive thyself; Thy mis'ry and affection make thee foolish. Art. Not so; there is a secret passage yonder. That stone (pointing to it) like many others in the wall, But rougher still (goes close to the stone and touches it), look at it! take good heed, Has in its core a groove on which it turns: A man's full strength will move it, and despair Will make thee strong. Sam. Were two men's strength required, I feel within me The means for such deliverance; if, indeed, Thou hast not been deceived by some false tale. Art. I'm not deceived. But wait, when I am gone, With limbs yet seemingly enthrall'd, until The wary guard hath come to ascertain Thy presence here; and then, when he retires,â Thou knowst the rest.âHaste, let me loose thy shackles. Is this the way? [Kneeling down and using her implements for breaking the chains, which she draws from the folds of her robe. Sam. Well done, my most incomparable sister! Affection seems to teach thee craftsman's skill. Art. This link is broken. Sam. So it is indeed. If I am fated yet to live on earth, A prosp'rous man, I'll have thy figure graven, As now thou art, with implements in hand, And make of it a tutelary idol. Art. (still working at the chains.) Ha! thou speakst cheerly now; and thy changed voice Is a good omen. Dost thou not remember How once in play I bound thy stripling limbs With braided reeds, as a mock criminal? We little thoughtâAnother link is conquer'd; And one alone remains. [Tries to unloose it. But it is stubborn. Oh, if that I should now lack needed strength! Vile, hateful link, give way! Enter Rasinga, and she starts up, letting fall her tools on the ground. Ras. And thou art here, thou most rebellious woman! A faithful spy had given me notice of it, And yet, methought, it was impossible Thou couldst be so rebellious, so bereft Of female honour, matronly allegiance. Art. Upbraid me not, my lord; I've at your feet Implored you to relent and spare his life, The last shoot of my father's honour'd house. But thou, with unrelenting tyranny, Hast chid me from thee.âMatronly allegiance, E'en in a favour'd and beloved wife, O'errules not every duty; and to her, Who is despised, abandon'd, and disgraced, Can it be more imperious? No, Rasinga; I were unmeet to wear a woman's form, If, with the means to save my brother's life, Not implicating thine, I had, from fear Of thy displeasure, grievous as it is, Forborne to use them. Ras. Ha! such bold words to justify the act, Making rebellion virtue! Such audacity Calls for the punishment which law provides For faithless and for disobedient wives. Sam. Rasinga, if that shameful threat be serious, Thou art the fellest, fiercest, meanest tyrant, That e'er joined human form to demon's spirit. Ras. And dost thou also front me with a storm Of loud injurious clamour?âHo, without! [Calling aloud. I came not here to hold a wordy war With criminals and women.âHo! I say. Enter Guards. Secure the prisoner, and fasten tightly His unlock'd chains.âAnd, lady, come thou instantly To such enthralment as becomes thy crime. [Exeunt Rasinga and Artina, who is led off by guards, while motioning her last farewell to Samarkoon. The scene closes. SCENE IX. An apartment in the house of Montebesa. Samar is discovered playing on the floor with toys, and Sabaw attÃ© sitting by him. Samar (holding up a toy). This is the prettiest plaything of them all: I will not use it till my mother come, That she may see it fresh and beautiful. Sab. Alas, sweet Samar! would that she were here! Samar. Will she not soon? how long she stays away! And she has been so kind to me of late. Sab. Was she not always kind? Samar. Yes, always very kind; but since my father Has thought of that new brideâI hate that brideâ And spoken to me seldom and with looks Not like his wonted looks, she has been kinder; Has kiss'd me oftener, and has held me closer To her soft bosom. O she loves me dearly! And dearly I love her!âWhere is she now, That thou shouldst say, âI would that she were here!â Sab. Dear boy; I may not tell thee. Samar. May not tell me! Then she is in some sad and hateful place, And I will go to her. Sab. Ah no! thou canst not. Samar. I will; what shall withhold me, SabawattÃ©? Sab. Strong bolts and bars, dear child! Samar. Is she in prison? Sab. She is. Samar. And who hath dared to put her there? Sab. Thy father. Samar. Then he is a wicked man, Most cruel and most wicked. I'll stay no longer here; I'll go to her; And if through bolts and bars I may not pass, I at her door will live, as my poor dog Close by my threshold lies and pines and moans, When he's shut out from me.âI needs must go; Rooms are too good for me when she's in prison. Come, lead me to the place; I charge thee, do; I'll stay no longer here. Enter Montebesa, and he runs to her, clasping her knees, and bursting into tears. Mont. What is the matter with thee, my dear child? (To SabawattÃ©.) Does he know aught? Sab. I could not keep it from him. Samar. I know it all; I know it all, good granddame. O take me to her! take me to her prison! I'll be with her; I'll be and bide with her; No other place shall hold me. Mont. Be pacified, dear child! be pacified, And I myself will take thee to thy mother: The guards will not refuse to let me pass. Weep not so bitterly, my own dear Samar! Fy! wipe away those tears and come with me. Sab. A blessing on you, madam, for this goodness! It had been cruelty to keep him here. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. The private chamber of Rasinga, who is discovered walking backwards and forwards in great agitation. Ras. That Iâthat I alone must be restrain'd! The very meanest chief who holds a mansion May therein take his pleasure with a second, When that his earlier wife begins to fade, Or that his wearied heart longs for another. Ay, this may be; but I am deem'd a slave, A tamedâa woman boundâa simple fool. [After a pause. Nor did I seek for it; fate was my tempter. That face of beauty was by fate unveil'd; And I must needs forbear to look upon it, Or looking, must forbear to love.âBold traitor! That he should also, in that very moment, Catch the bright glimpse and dare to be my rival! Fy, fy! His jealous sister set him on. Why is my mind so rack'd and rent with this? Jealous, rebellious, spiteful, as she is, I need not, will not look upon her punishment. Beneath the wat'ry gleam one moment's struggle,â No more but this. [Tossing his arms in agony. Oh, oh! there was a time, A time but shortly passed, when such a thought Had beenâthe cords of life had snapt asunder At such a thought.âAnd it must come to this! [After another perturbed pause. It needs must be: I'm driven to the brink. What is a woman's life, or any life That poisons his repose for whom it flourish'd? I would have cherish'd, honour'd her, yet she, Rejecting all, has e'en to this extremityâ No, no! it is that hateful fiend her brother, Who for his damn'd desires and my dishonour Hath urged her on.âThe blood from his shorn trunk Shall to mine eyes be as the gushing fount To the parch'd pilgrimâBlood! but that his rank Forbids such execution, his marr'd carcass, A trampled massâa spectacle of horror, Shouldâthe detested traitor! [Noise at the door. Who is there? Juan (without). Juan de Creda: pray undo thy door. Ras. No, not to thee; not e'en to thee, De Creda. Juan (without). Nay, but thou must, or fail in honest truth. I have thy promise once again to see me Ere thy revengeful purpose take effect; Yea, and I hold thee to it. Ras. Turn from my door, for thou since then hast seen me, And hast no further claim. Juan (without). Tamper not so unfairly with thy words: I saw thee as the forest peasant sees A hunted tiger passing to his lair. Is this sufficient to acquit thee? No; I claim thy promise still, as unredeem'd. Unbar thy chamber door and let me in. Ras. (opening the door, and as Juan enters). Come in, come in then, if it must be so. Is misery a pleasant sight to thee, That thou dost beg and pray to look upon it? Juan. Forgive me, brave Rasinga, if I say, The mis'ry of thine alter'd face, to me Is sight more welcome than a brow composed. But 'tis again to change that haggard face To the composure of a peaceful mind, That I am come.âO deign to listen to me! Let me beseech thee not to wreck thy happiness For fell revenge! Ras. Well, well; and were it so, I wreck my happiness to save my honour. Juan. To save thine honour? Ras. Yes; the meanest salve That turns the stubborn soil with dropping brow, Would hold an outraged, unrevenged chief, As more contemptible than torpid reptile That cannot sting the foot which treads upon it. Juan. When fear or sordid motives are imputed As causes why revenge hath been forborne, Contempt will follow, from the natural feelings Of every breast, or savage or instructed. But when the valiant and the gen'rous pardon, E'en instantly as lightning rends the trunk Of the strong Nahagaha The iron tree. pride of the wood, A kindred glow of admiration passes Through every manly bosom, proving surely, That men are brethren, children of one sire, The Lord of heaven and earth. Ras. Perplex me not with vain and lofty words, That to the stunn'd ear of an injured man Are like the fitful sounds of a swoln torrent, Noble, but void of all distinctive meaning. Juan. Their meaning is distinct as well as noble, Teaching to froward man the will of God. Ras. And who taught thee to know this will of God? Juan. Our sacred Scripture. Ras. What? your Christian Scripture, Which, as I have been told, hath bred more discord Than all the other firebrands of the earth, With church opposed to church, and sect to sect, In fierce contention; ay, fell bloody strife. Certes, if all from the same book be taught, Its words may give, as I before have said, A noble sound, but no distinctive meaning. Juan. That which thou hast been told of shameful discord, Perversely drawn from the pure source of peace, Is true; and yet it is a book of wisdom, Whose clear, important, general truths may guide The simplest and the wisest: truths which still Have been by every church and sect acknowledged. Ras. And what, I pray, are these acknowledged precepts, Which they but learn, it seems, to disobey? Juan. The love of God and of that blessed Being, Sent in His love to teach His will to men, Imploring them their hearts to purify From hatred, wrong, and ev'ry sensual excess, That in a happier world, when this is past, They may enjoy true blessedness for ever. Ras. Then why hold all this coil concerning that Which is so plain, and excellent, and acknowledged? Juan. Because they have in busy restless zeal Raised to importance slight and trivial parts; Contending for them, till they have at last Believed them of more moment, e'en than all The plain and lib'ral tenor of the whole. As if we should maintain a wart or mole To be the main distinctions of a man, Rather than the fair brow and upright form,â The graceful, general lineaments of nature. Ras. This is indeed most strange: how hath it been? Juan. The Scripture lay before them like the sky, With all its glorious stars, in some smooth pool Clearly reflected, till in busy idleness, Like children gath'ring pebbles on its brink, Each needs must cast his mite of learning in To try its depth, till sky, and stars, and glory, Become one wrinkled maze of wild confusion. But that good Scripture and its blessed Author Stand far apart from such perplex'd contention, As the bright sky from the distorted surface Of broken waters wherein it was imaged. Ras. And this good Scripture does, as thou believest, Contain the will of God. Juan. I do believe it. And therein is a noble duty taught, To pardon injuries,âto pardon enemies. Ras. I do not doubt it. 'Tis an easy matter For holy sage or prophet in his cell, Who lives aloof from wrongs and injuries Which other men endure, to teach such precepts. Juan. Most justly urged: but He who utter'd this Did not enforce it at a rate so easy. Though proved by many good and marv'llous acts To be the mission'd Son of the Most High, He meekly bore the wrongs of wicked men; And in the agonies of crucifixion,â The cruel death He died,âdid from His cross Look up to heav'n in earnest supplication E'en for the men who were inflicting on Him Those shameful suff'rings,âpardon e'en for them. Ras. (bowing his head, and covering his face with his hands). Indeed, indeed, this was a noble Being. Juan. Ay, brave Rasinga; ireful as thou art, Thou hast a heart to own such excellence. [Laying his hand soothingly on Rasinga's. And do consider too how he who wrong'd thee,â The youthful Samarkoonâ Ras. (shaking off his hand impatiently). Name not the villain! Juan. That epithet belongs not to a youth, Who in the fever'd madness of strong passion, By beauty kindled. goaded by despair, Perhaps with sympathy, for that he deem'd A sister's sorrowsâ Ras. Hold thy peace, De Creda; Thy words exasperate and stir within me The half-spent flames of wrath. He is a villain, an audacious villain; A most ungrateful, cunning, artful villain. Leave me, I charge thee, lest thou utter that Which might provoke me to unseemly outrage. Lowe my life to thee, and but for thatâ Leave me, I charge thee. Juan. I do not fear what thou mayst do to me. Ras. No; but I fear it: therefore quit me instantly. Out, out! [Opening the door and pushing him away. Ho! Ehleypoolie! ye who wait without, I want your presence here. [Exit Juan Enter Ehleypoolie and Mihdoony. Ehley. (after having waited some time to receive the commands of his master, who, without noticing him, walks about the chamber in violent agitation). My lord, we humbly wait for your commands. (Aside to Mihdoony.) He heeds us not: as though we were not here. (Aloud.) We humbly wait, my lord, to know your pleasure. Ras. My pleasure isâ [Stopping, and looking bewildered. I know not what it is. Mih. Perhaps, my lord, you wish to countermand Some orders that regard the executions Fix'd for to-morrow, at an hour so early. Ras. When did Rasinga countermand his orders, So call'd for, and so given?âWhy wait ye here! Ehley. You summon'd us, my lord; and well you know That Ehleypoolie hath a ready aptness Forâ Ras. Boasting, fooling, flattery, and lies. Begone, I say; I did not summon you. At least I meant it not. [Turns away hastily, and exit by another door. Ehley. For boasting, fooling, flattery, and lies! How angry men pervert all sober judgment! If I commend myself, who, like myself, Can know so well my actual claims to praise? Mih. Most true; for surely no one else doth know it. Ehley. And fooling is an angry name for wit. Mih. Thy wit is fooling; therefore should it seem, Thy fooling may be wit. Then for thy flattery, What dost thou say to that? Ehley. Had he disliked it, It had been dealt to him in scantier measure. And liesâto hear a prince whose fitful humours Can mar or make the vassals who surround him, Name this as special charge on any one! His violent passions have reduced his judgment To very childishness. Mih. But dost thou think the fierceness of his wrath Will make him really bring to execution A wife who has so long and dearly loved him? Ehley. How should I know what he will really do? The words he spoke to me e'en now may show thee His judgment is obscured. But if he do; Where is the harm when faded wives are cross And will not live in quietness with a younger, To help them on a step to their NewanÃ©? She never favour'd me, that dame Artina, And I foresaw she would not come to good. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A large court, or open space, with every thing prepared for the execution of Samarkoon: a seat of state near the front of the stage. Spectators and guards discovered. 1st spec. There is a mass of life assembled here: All eyes, no voice; there is not e'en the murmur Of stifled whispers.âDeep and solemn silence! 2d spec. Hush, hush! Artina comes, and by her side, Her son in the habiliments of one Prepared for death. This surely cannot be: It is impossible. 1st spec. I hope it is. Enter Artina and Samar, with SabawattÃ© on the one side of them, and Juan de Creda on the other; attendants following. Art. Alas, for thee, my noble, generous child! Samar. Fear not for me, dear mother! Lean upon me. Nay, let me feel your hand upon my shoulder, And press'd more heavily. It pleases me, Weak as I am, to think I am thy prop. Art. O what a prop thou wouldst have been to me! And what a creature for a loathly grave,â For death to prey upon!âTurn, turn! Oh, turn! Advance no further on this dreadful path Samar. I came not here to turn; and for the path, And what it leads to, if you can endure it, Then so can I:âfear not for me, dear mother! Nay, do not fear at all; 'twill soon be over. Art. Oh! my brave heart! my anguish and my pride, E'en on the very margin of the grave.â Good SabawattÃ©! hold him; take him from me. Sab. I cannot, madam; and De Creda says, 'Tis best that you should yield to his desire. Art. It is a fearfulâan appalling risk. Sab. Is there aught else that you would charge me with? Art. Yes, dearest friend, there isâit is my last. Let not my little daughters know of this; They are too young to miss me. Little Moora Will soon forget that she has seen my face; Therefore whoe'er is kind to them they'll love. Say this to her, who will so shortly fill Their mother's place, and she will pity them. Add, if thou wilt, that I such gentle dealings Expected from her hands, and bade thee teach them To love and honour her. Sab. My heart will burst in uttering such words. Art. Yet for my sake thou'lt do it; wilt thou not? [SabawattÃ© motions assent, but cannot speak. Enter Samarkoon chained and guarded. Art. (rushing on to meet him). My brother, my young Samarkoon; my brother, Whom I so loved in early, happy days; Thou top and blossom of my father's house! Sam. Weep not, my sister; death brings sure relief; And many a brave man's son has died the death That now abideth me. Art. Alas! ere that bright sun which shines so brightly Shall reach his noon, of my brave father's race No male descendant shall remain alive,â Not one to wear the honours of his name,â And I the cursed cause of all this wreck! Oh, what was I, that I presumptuously Should think to keep his undivided heart! 'Twere better I had lived a drudge,âa slave, To do the meanest service of his house, Than see thee thus, my hapless, noble brother. Sam. Lament not, gentle sister; to have seen thee Debased and scorn'd, and that most wondrous creature, Whose name I will not utter, made the means Of vexing theeâit would have driven me frantic. Then do not thus lament; nor think that I Of aught accuse thee. No; still let us be In love most dearly link'd, which only death Has power to sever.â [To Samar, as first observing him. Boy, why art thou here? Samar. To be my mother's partner and companion. 'Tis meet; for who but me should cling to her? Enter Rasinga, and places himself in the seat: a deep silence follows for a considerable time. Mih. (who has kept guard with his spearmen over Samarkoon, now approaching Rasinga). The hour is past, my lord, that was appointed; And you commanded me to give you notice. Is it your pleasure that the executioners Proceed to do their office on the prisoners, Who are all three prepared? Ras. What dost thou say? Mih. The three prepared for death abide your signal. Ras. There are but two. Mih. Forgive opposing words; there is a third. Ras. A third, sayst thou? and who? Mih. Your son, my lord; A volunteer for death, whom no persuasion Can move to be divided from his mother. Ras. I cannot credit this; it is some craft,â Some poor device. Go, bring the boy to me. [Mihdoony leads Samar to his father. Why art thou here, my child? and is it so, That thou dost wish to die? Samar. I wish to be where'er my mother is, Alive or dead. Ras. Think well of what thou sayst It shall be so if thou indeed desire it. But be advised! death is a dreadful thing. Samar. They say it is: but I will be with her; I'll die her death, and feel but what she suffers. Ras. And art thou not afraid? Thou'rt ignorant; Thou dost not know the misery of drowning;â The booming waters closing over thee, And thou still sinking, struggling in the tank, On whose deep bottom weeds and water snakes, And filthy lizards will around thee twine, While thou art choking. It is horrible. Samar. The death that is appointed for my mother Is good enough for me. We'll be together: Clinging to her, I shall not be afraid, No, nor will she. Ras. But wherefore wilt thou leave thy father, Samar? Thou'st not offended me; I love thee dearly; I have no son but thee. Samar. But thou wilt soon, Thy new young wife will give thee soon another, And he will be thy son; but I will be Son of Artina. We'll be still together: When, in the form of antelope or loorie, She wends her way to Boodhoo, I shall still Be as her young one, sporting by her side. Ras. (catching him in his arms, and bursting into tears). My generous boy! my noble valiant boy! O such a son bestow'd on such a father! Live, noble creature! and thy mother also! Her crime is pardon'd, if it was a crime; Ye shall not be divided. Samar (running back to Artina). O mother! raise your eyes! you are to live; We're both to live; my father says we are. And he has wept, and he has kiss'd me too, As he was wont to do, ay, fonder far. Come, come! [Pulling her towards Rasinga. He's good, you need not fear him now. Ras. Artina, that brave child has won thy life; And he hath won for meâI have no words That can express what he hath won for me. But thou art sad and silent; how is this, With life, and such a son to make life sweet? Art. I have a son, but my brave father, soon,â Who died an honour'd death, and in his grave Lies like an honour'd chief,âwill have no son, No male descendant, living on the earth, To keep his name and lineage from extinction. [Rasinga throws himself into his seat and buries his face in his mantle. 1st spec. (in a low voice). Well timed and wisely spoken: 'tis a woman Worthy to be the mother of that boy. 2d spec. (in a low voice to the first). Look, look, I pray thee, how Rasinga's breast Rises and falls beneath its silken vesture. 1st spec. (as before). There is within a dreadful conflict passing, Known by these tokens, as swoln waves aloft Betray the secret earthquake's deep-pent struggles. 2d spec. (as before). But he is calmer now, and puts away The cover from his face: he seems relieved. Ras. (looking round him). Approach, De Creda; thou hast stood aloof: Thou feelst my late rude passion and unkindness. Misery makes better men than I unkind; But pardon me, and I will make amends. I would not listen to thy friendly counsel, But now I will most freely grant to thee Whatever grace or favour thou desirest: Even now, before thou nam'st it. Juan. Thanks, thanks, Rasinga! this is brave amends. [Runs to Samarkoon, and commands his chains to be knocked off, speaking impatiently as it is doing. Out on such tardy bungling! Ye are craftsmen Who know full well the art to bind men's limbs, But not to set them free. [Leads Samarkoon when unbound towards Rasinga, speaking to him as they go. Come, noble Samarkoon! nay, look more gracious: If thou disdainst to thank him for thy life, That falls to me, and I will do it gladly. [Presenting Samarkoon to Rasinga. This is the boon which thou hast granted me, The life of Samarkoon: a boon more precious To him who grants than who receives it. Yet Take my most ardent thanks; take many thanks From other grateful bosoms, beating near thee. Art. (kneeling to embrace the knees of Rasinga). And mine; O mine! wilt thou not look upon me? I do not now repine that thou art changed: Be happy with another fairer dame, It shall not grieve me now. Ras. (raising her). Away, Artina, do not thank me thus. Remove her, Samarkoon, a little space. [Waving them off. Juan de Creda, art thou satisfied? Have I done well? Juan. Yes, I am satisfied. Ras. (drawing himself up with dignity). But I am not; and that which I have done Would not have satisfied the generous Saviour Who died upon the cross. Thy friend is pardon'd, And more than pardon'd;âhe is now my brother, And I to him resign the mountain bride. [A shout of joy bursts from all around: Artina folds Samar to her breast, and Samarkoon falls at the feet of Rasinga. Sam. My noble generous foe, whom I have wrong'd; Urged by strong passions, wrong'd most grievously! Now may I kneel to thee without disgrace, For thou hast bound me with those bands of strength That do ennoble, not disgrace the bravest. Ras. Rise, Samarkoon; I do accept thy thanks Since that which I resign is worthâBut cease! Speak not of thisâif it be possible, We'll think of this no more. (Turning to Artina.) And now, my only and my noble wife, And thou, my dauntless boy, stand by my side, And I, so flank'd, will feel myself in honour,â Honour that lifts and warms and cheers the heart. And we shall have a feast within our walls; Our good De Creda, he will tarry with us; He will not go to-morrow as he threaten'd. Juan. I'll stay with you a day beyond the time, And then I must depart; a pressing duty Compels me so to do. Ras. But thou'lt return again, and bring with thee The sacred Book which thou hast told me of? Juan. I will return again and bring that book, If Heaven permit. But man's uncertain life Is like a rain-drop hanging on the bough, Among ten thousand of its sparkling kindred, The remnants of some passing thunder shower, Which have their moments, dropping one by one, And which shall soonest lose its perilous hold We cannot guess.â I, on the continent, must for a time A wand'rer be; if I return no more, You may conclude death has prevented me. Enter Montebesa. Ras. Ha, mother! welcome, welcome, Montebesa! There; take again your daughter and her boy. We've striven stoutly with a fearful storm, But, thanks to good De Creda, it is past; And all the brighter shall our sky appear, For that the clouds which have obscured its face Were of a denseness dark and terrible.

      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POETRY. METRICAL LEGENDS. A METRICAL LEGEND OF WILLIAM WALLACE. I. Insensible to high heroic deeds, Is there a spirit clothed in mortal weeds, Who at the Patriot's moving story, Devoted to his country's good, Devoted to his country's glory, Shedding for freemen's rights his generous blood;â List'neth not with breath heaved high, Quiv'ring nerve, and glistening eye, Feeling within a spark of heavenly flame, That with the hero's worth may humble kindred claim? If such there be, still let him plod On the dull foggy paths of care, Nor raise his eyes from the dank sod To view creation fair: What boots to him the wondrous works of God? His soul with brutal things hath ta'en its earthy lair. II. Come, youths, whose eyes are forward cast, And in the future see the past,â The past, as winnow'd in the early mind, With husk and prickle left behind! Come; whether under lowland vest, Or, by the mountain-tartan prest, Your gen'rous bosoms heave; Pausing a while in thoughtful rest, My legend lay receive. Come, aged sires, who love to tell What fields were fought, what deeds were done; What things in olden times befell,â Those good old times, whose term is run! Come ye, whose manly strength with pride Is breasting now the present tide Of worldly strife, and cast aside A hasty glance at what hath been! Come, courtly dames, in silken sheen, And ye, who under thatched roofs abide; Yea, e'en the barefoot child by cottage fire, Who doth some shreds of northern lore acquire, By the stirr'd embers' scanty light,â List to my legend lay of Wallace wight. III. Scotland, with breast unmail'd, had sheath'd her sword, Stifling each rising curse and hopeless prayer, And sunk beneath the Southron's faithless lord, In sullen, deep despair. The holds and castles of the land Were by her hateful foemen mann'd. To revels in each stately hall, Did tongues of foreign accent call, Where her quell'd chiefs must tamely bear From braggart pride the taunting jeer. Her harvest-fields, by strangers reap'd. Were in the stranger's garner heap'd. The tenant of the poorest cot, Seeing the spoiler from his door Bear unreproved his hard-earn'd store, Blush'd thus to be, and be a Scot. The very infant at his mother's beck, Though with writh'd lip and scowling eye, Was taught to keep his lisping tongue in cheek, Nor curse the Southron passing by. IV. Baron brave and girded knight, The tyrant's hireling slaves could be: Nor graced their state, nor held their right. Alone upon his rocky height, The eagle rear'd his unstain'd crest, And soaring from his cloudy nest, Turn'd to the sun his daring eye, And wing'd at will the azure sky, For he alone was free. V. Oh! who so base as not to feel The pride of freedom once enjoy'd, Though hostile gold or hostile steel Have long that bliss destroy'd! The meanest drudge will sometimes vaunt Of independent sires, who bore Names known to fame in days of yore, 'Spite of the smiling stranger's taunt; But recent freedom lostâwhat heart Can bear the humbling thoughtâthe quick'ning, madd'ning smart! VI. Yes, Caledonian hearts did burn, And their base chain in secret spurn; And, bold upon some future day, Swore to assert Old Scotland's native sway; But 'twas in fitful thoughts that pass'd in thought away. Though musing in lone cave or forest deep, Some generous youths might all indignant weep; Or in the vision'd hours of sleep, Gird on their swords for Scotland's right, And from her soil the spoiler sweep, Yet all this bold emprise pass'd with the passing night. VII. But in the woods of Allerslie, Within the walls of good Dundee, Or by the pleasant banks of Ayr, Wand'ring o'er heath or upland fair, Existed worth without alloy, In form a man, in years a boy, Whose nightly thoughts for Scotland's weal, Which clothed his form in mimic steel, Which helm'd his brow, and glaved his hand To drive the tyrant from the land, Pass'd not away with passing sleep; But did, as danger nearer drew, Their purposed bent the firmer keep, And still the bolder grew. VIII. 'Tis pleasant in his early frolic feats, Which fond tradition long and oft repeats, The op'ning of some dauntless soul to trace, Whose bright career of fame, a country's annals grace; Yet this brief legend must forbear to tell The bold adventures that befell The stripling Wallace, light and strong, The shady woods of Clyde among, Where, roaring o'er its rocky walls, The water's headlong torrent falls, Full, rapid, powerful, flashing to the light, Till sunk the boiling gulf beneath, It mounts again like snowy wreath, Which, scatter'd by contending blasts, Back to the clouds their treasure casts, A ceaseless wild turmoil, a grand and wondrous sight! Or, climbing Cartland's Craigs, that high O'er their pent river strike the eye, Wall above wall, half veil'd, half seen, The pendant folds of wood between, With jagged breach, and rift, and scar, Like the scorch'd wreck of ancient war, And seem, to musing fancy's gaze, The ruin'd holds of other days. His native scenes, sublime and wild, Where oft the youth his hours beguiled, As forester with bugle horn; As angler in the pooly wave; As fugitive in lonely cave, Forsaken and forlorn! When still, as foemen cross'd his way, Alone, defenceless, or at bay, He raised his arm for freeman's right, And on proud robbers fell the power of Wallace wight. IX. There is a melancholy pleasure In tales of hapless love;âa treasure From which the sadden'd bosom borrows A respite short from present sorrows, And e'en the gay delight to feel, As down young cheeks the soft tears steal; Yet will I not that woeful tale renew, And in light hasty words relate How the base Southron's arm a woman slew, And robb'd him of his wedded mate. The name of her who shared his noble breast, Shall be remember'd and be blest. A sweeter lay, a gentler song, To those sad woes belong! X. As lightning from some twilight cloud, At first but like a streaky line In the hush'd sky, with fitful shine Its unregarded brightness pours, Till from its spreading, darkly volumed shroud The bursting tempest roars; His countrymen with faithless gaze Beheld his valour's early blaze. XI. But rose at length with swelling fame The honours of his deathless name; Till to the country's farthest bound, All gen'rous hearts stirr'd at the sound; Then Scotland's youth with new-waked pride, Flock'd gladly to the hero's side, In harness braced, with burnish'd brand, A brave and noble band! XII. Lenox, Douglas, Campbell, Hay, Boyd, Scrimgeour, Ruthven, Haliday, Gordon, Crawford, Keith were there; Lauder, Lundy. Clealand, Kerr, Steven, Ireland's vagrant lord; Newbiggen, Fraser, Rutherford, Dundas and Tinto, Currie, Scott; Nor be in this brave list forgot A Wallace of the hero's blood, With many patriots staunch and good; And first, though latest named, there came, Within his gen'rous breast to hold A brother's place, true war-mate bold! The good, the gallant Grame. XIII. Thus grown to strength, on Bigger's well-fought field He made on marshall'd host his first essay; Where Edward's gather'd powers, in strong array, Did to superior skill and valour yield, And gain'd the glorious day. XIV. Then at the Forest kirk, that spot of ground Long to be honour'd, flush'd with victory, Crowded the Scottish worthies, bold and free, Their noble chieftain round; Where many a generous heart beat high With glowing cheek and flashing eye, And many a portly figure trode With stately steps the trampled sod. Banners in the wind were streaming; In the morning light were gleaming Sword, and spear, and burnish'd mail, And crested helm, and avantail, And tartan plaids, of many a hue, In flickering sunbeams brighter grew, While youthful warriors' weapons ring With hopeful, wanton brandishing. XV. There, midmost in the warlike throng, Stood William Wallace, tall and strong; Towering far above the rest, With portly mien and ample breast, Brow and eye of high command; Visage fair, and figure grand: E'en to the dullest peasant standing by, Who fasten'd still on him a wondering eye, He seem'd the master-spirit of the land. XVI. O for some magie power to give In vision'd form what then did live! That group of heroes to portray, Who from their trammell'd country broke The hateful tyrant's galling yoke On that eventful day! XVII. Behold! like changeful streamers of the North, Which tinge at times the wintry night, With many hues of glowing light, Their momentary forms break forth To Fancy's gifted sight. Each in his warlike panoply With sable plumage waving high, And burnish'd sword in sinewy hand, Appears a chieftain of command, Whose will, by look or sign to eatch, A thousand eager vassals watch. What though those warriors, gleaming round, On peaceful death-bed never lay, But each, upon his fated day, His end on field or scaffold found; Oh! start not at the vision bright, As if it were a ghastly sight! For, 'midst their earthly coil, they knew Feelings of joy so keen, so true, As he who feels, with up-raised eye, Thanks heaven for life, and cannot rue The gift, be what it may the death that he shall die. XVIII. Warden of Scotland (not ashamed A native right of rule to own In worth and valour matchless shown) They William Wallace there proclaim'd; And there, exultingly, each gallant soul, E'en proudly yielded to such high controul. Greater than aught a tyrant ere achieved, Was power so given, and so received. XIX. This truth full well King Edward knew, And back his scatter'd host he drew, Suing for peace with prudent guile; And Wallace in his mind, the while, Scanning with wary, wise debate The various dangers of the state, Desire of further high revenge foregoes To give the land repose. But smother'd hatred, in the garb of peace, Did not, mean time, from hostile cunning cease; But still more cruel deeds devised, In that deceitful seeming guised. XX. The Southron rulers, phrasing fair Their notice, summon'd lord, and laird, and knight, To hold with them an ancient court of right, At the good town, so named, their court of Ayr. And at this general summons came The pride and hope of many a name, The love and anxious care of many a gentle dame. XXI. Ent'ring the fatal Barns, fair sight! Went one by one the manly train, But neither baron, laird, nor knight, Did e'er return again. A heaven-commission'd friend that day Stopp'd Wallace, hast'ning on his way, (Who, by some seeming chance detain'd, Had later at his home remain'd,) The horse's bridle sternly grasp'd, And then for rueful utterance gasp'd. âOh! go not to the Barns of Ayr! âKindred and friends are murder'd there. âThe faithless Southrons, one by one, âOn them the hangman's task have done. âOh! turn thy steed, and fearful ruin shun!â He, shudd'ring, heard, with visage pale, Which quickly changed to wrath's terrific hue; And then apace came sorrow's bursting wail; The noble heart could weep that could not quail, âMy friends, my kinsmen, war-mates, bold and true! âMet ye a villain's end! Oh is it so with you!â XXII. The hero turn'd his chafing steed, And to the wild woods bent his speed. But not to keep in hiding there, Or give his sorrow to despair, For the fierce tumult in his breast To speedy, dreadful action press'd. And there within a tangled glade, List'ning the courser's coming tread, With hearts that shared his ire and grief, A faithful band received their chief. XXIII. In Ayr the guilty Southrons held a feast, When that dire day its direful course had run, And laid them down, their weary limbs to rest Where the foul deed was done. But ere beneath the cottage thatch Cocks had crow'd the second watch; When sleepers breathe in heavy plight, Press'd with the visions of the night, And spirits, from unhallow'd ground, Ascend, to walk their silent round; When trembles dell, or desert heath, The witches' orgies-dance beneath,â To the roused Warder's fearful gaze, The Barns of Ayr were in a blaze. XXIV. The dense, dun smoke was mounting slow And stately, from the flaming wreck below, And mantling far aloft in many a volumed wreath; Whilst town and woods, and ocean wide did lie, Tinctured like glowing furnace-iron, beneath Its awful canopy. Red mazy sparks soon with the dense smoke blended, And far around like fiery sleet descended. From the scorch'd and crackling pile Fierce burst the growing flames the while; Through creviced wall and buttress strong, Sweeping the rafter'd roofs along; Which, as with sudden crash they fell, Their raging fierceness seem'd to quell, And for a passing instant spread O'er land and sea a lurid shade; Then with increasing brightness, high In spiral form, shot to the sky With momentary height so grand, That chill'd beholders breathless stand. XXV. Thus rose and fell the flaming surgy flood, 'Till feneing round the gulphy light, Black, jagg'd, and bare, a fearful sight! Like ruin grim of former days, Seen 'thwart the broad sun's setting rays, The guilty fabric stood. XXVI. And dreadful are the deaths, I ween, Which midst that fearful wreck have been. The pike and sword, and smoke and fire, Have minister'd to vengeful ire. New-waked wretches stood aghast To see the fire-flood in their rear, Close to their breast the pointed spear, And in wild horror yell'd their last. XXVII. But what dark figures now emerge From the dread gulph and cross the light, Appearing on its fearful verge, Each like an armed sprite? Whilst one above the rest doth tower,â A form of stern gigantic power, Whirling from his lofty stand The smould'ring stone or burning brand? Those are the leagued for Scotland's native right, Whose clashing arms rang Southron's knell, When to their fearful work they fell,â That form is Wallace wight. XXVIII. And he like heaven's impetuous blast Which stops not on its mission'd way, By early morn, in strong array, Onward to Glasgow pass'd; Where English Piercy held the rule; Too noble and too brave to be a tyrant's tool. A summon'd court should there have been, But there far other coil was seen. With fellest rage, in lane and street, Did harness'd Scot and Southron meet; Well fought and bloody was the fierce affray: But Piercy was by Wallace slain, Who put to rout his num'rous train, And gain'd the town by noon of day. XXIX. Nor paused he there, for ev'ning tide Saw him at Bothwell's hostile gate, Which might not long assault abide, But yielded to its fate. And on from thence, with growing force, He held his rapid, glorious course; Whilst his roused clansmen, braced and bold, As town and castle, tower and hold, To the resistless victor fell, His patriot numbers swell. Thus when with current full and strong, The wintry river bears along Through mountain pass, and frith, and plain;â Streams that from many sources pour, Answer from far its kindred roar, And deep'ning echoes roar again. From its hill of heathy brown, The muirland streamlet hastens down; The mountain torrent from its rock, Shoots to the glen with furious shock; E'en brooklet low, and sluggish burn, Speed to their chief with many a mazy turn. And in his mingled strength, roll proudly to the main. XXX. O'er Stirling's towers his standard plays, Lorn owns his rule, Argyle obeys. In Angus, Merns, and Aberdeen, Nor English lord, nor serf is seen; Dundee alone averts King Edward's fate, And Scotland's warden thunders at her gate. XXXI. But there his eager hopes are crost, For news are brought of English host, Which fast approaching through the land, At Stirling mean to make their stand. Faint speaks the haggard breathless scout, Like one escaped from bloody rout,â âOn, Cressingham and Warren lead âThe marshall'd host with stalwart speed, âIt numbers thirty thousand men, âAnd thine, bold chieftain, only ten.â XXXII. But higher tower'd the chieftain's head, Broad grew his breast with ampler spread; O'er cheek and brow the deep flush pass'd, And to high heaven his eyes he cast: Right plainly spoke that silent prayer, âMy strength and aid are there!â Then look'd he round with kindly cheer On his brave war-mates standing near, Who scann'd his face with eager eye His secret feelings to descry. âCome, Hearts! who, on your native soil, âFor Scotland's cause have bravely stood, âCome, brace ye for another broil, âAnd prove your generous blood. âLet us but front the tyrant's train, âAnd he who lists may count their numbers then!â XXXIII. Nor dull of heart, nor slow were they Their noble leader to obey. Cheer'd with loud shouts he gave his prompt command. Forthwith to bound them on their way. And straight their eager march they take O'er hill and heath, o'er burn and brake, Till marshall'd soon in dark array, Upon their destined field of war they stand. XXXIV. Behind them lay the hardy north; Before, the slowly winding Forth Flow'd o'er the noiseless sand; Its full broad tide with fossy sides, Which east and west the land divides, By wooden bridge was spann'd. Beyond it, on a craggy slope, Whose chimney'd roofs the steep ridge cope, There smoked an ancient town; While higher on the firm-based rock, Which oft had braved war's thunder-shock, Embattled turrets frown. A frith with fields and woods, and hamlets gay, And mazy waters, slily seen, Glancing through shades of Alder green, Wore eastward from the sight to distance grey; While broomy knoll and rocky peak, And heathy mountains, bare and bleak, A lofty screen on either hand, Majestic rose, and grand. XXXV. Such was the field on which with dauntless pride They did their coming foe abide; Nor waited long till from afar Were spy'd their moving ranks of war, Like rising storm, which, from the western main, Bears on in seried length its cloudy train;â Slowly approaching on the burthen'd wind, Moves each dark mass, and still another lowers behind. And soon upon the bridge appears, Darkly rising on the light, Nodding plumes and pointed spears, And, crowding close, full many a warlike knight, Who from its narrow gorge successive pour To form their ranks upon the northern shore. XXXVI. Now, with notes of practised skill, English trumpets, sounding shrill, The battle's boastful prelude give, Which answer prompt and bold receive From Scottish drum's long rolling beat, And,âsound to valiant clansmen sweet!â The highland pipe, whose lengthen'd swell Of warlike pibroch, rose and fell, Like wailings of the midnight wind, With voice of distant streams combined, While mountain, rock, and dell, the martial din repeat. XXXVII. Then many a high-plumed gallant rear'd his head, And proudly smote the ground with firmer tread, Who did ere close of ev'ning, lie With ghastly face turn'd to the sky, No more again the rouse of war to hear. And many for the combat burn'd, Who never from its broil return'd, Kindred or home to cheer. How short the term that shall divide The firm-nerved youth's exerted force,â The warrior, glowing in his pride, From the cold stiffen'd corse! A little term pass'd with such speed, As would in courtly revel scarce suffice, Mated with lady fair in silken guise, The measured dance to lead. XXXVIII. His soldiers firm as living rock, Now braced them for the battle's shock; And watch'd their chieftain's keen looks glancing From marshall'd clans to foes advancing; Smiled with the smile his eye that lighten'd, Glow'd with the glow his brow that brighten'd: But when his burnish'd brand he drew, His towering form terrific grew, And every Scotchman, at the sight, Felt through his nerves a giant's might, And drew his patriot sword with Wallace wight. XXXIX. For what of thrilling sympathy, Did e'er in human bosom vie With that which stirs the soldier's breast, When, high in god-like worth confest, Some noble leader gives command, To combat for his native land? No; friendship's freely-flowing tide, The soul expanding; filial pride, That hears with craving, fond desire The bearings of a gallant sire; The yearnings of domestic bliss, E'en love itself will yield to this. XL. Few words the lofty hero utter'd, But deep response was widely mutter'd, Like echo'd echoes, circling round Some mountain lake's steep rocky bound. XLI. Then rush'd they fiercely on their foes, And loud o'er drum and war-pipe rose The battle's mingled roar. The eager shout, the weapon's clash; The adverse ranks' first closing crash, The sullen hum of striving life, The busy beat of trampling strife, From castle, rocks, and mountains round, Down the long firth, a grand and awful sound, A thousand echoes bore. XLII. Spears cross'd spears, a bending grove, As front to front the warriors strove. Through the dust-clouds, rising dun, Their burnish'd brands flash'd to the sun With quickly changing, shiv'ring light, Like streamers on the northern night, While arrow-showers came hurtling past, Like splinter'd wreck driven by the blast, What time fierce winter is contending With Norway's pines, their branches rending. XLIII. Long pennants, flags, and banners move The fearful strife of arms above, Not as display'd in colours fair, They floated on the morning air; But with a quick, ungentle motion, As sheeted sails, torn by the blast, Flap round some vessel's rocking mast Upon a stormy ocean. XLIV. Opposing ranks that onward bore, In tumult mix'd are ranks no more; Nor aught discern'd of skill or form;â All a wild, bick'ring, steely storm! While oft around some fav'rite chieftain's crest, The turmoil thick'ning, darkly rose, As on rough seas the billow grows, O'er lesser waves high-heaved, but soon depress'd. So gallant Grame, thou noble Scot! Around thee rose the fearful fray, And other brave compeers of bold essay, Who did not spare their mothers' sons that day, And ne'er shall be forgot. XLV. But where the mighty Wallace fought, Like spirit quick, like giant strong, Plunging the foe's thick ranks among, Wide room in little time was hew'd, And grizly sights around were strew'd; Recoil'd aghast the helmed throng, And every hostile thing to earth was brought. Full strong and hardy was the foe To whom he gave a second blow. Many a knight and lord Fell victims to his sword, And Cressingham's proud crest lay low. XLVI. And yet, all Southrons as they were, Their ranks dispersed, their leader slain, Passing the bridge with dauntless air, They still came pouring on the plain; But weaken'd of its rafter'd strength, 'Tis said by warlike craft, and trod By such successive crowds, at length The fabric fell with all its living load. Loud was the shriek the sinking Southrons gave, Thus dash'd into the deep and booming wave. For there a fearful death had they, Clutching each floating thing in vain, And struggling rose and sank again, Who, 'midst the battle's loud affray, Had the fair meed of honour sought, And on the field like lions fought. XLVII. And there, upon that fieldâa bloody field, Where many a wounded youth was lying, And many dead and many dying, Did England's arms to Scotland's heroes yield. The close confusion opening round, The wild pursuit's receding sound, Is ringing in their ears, who low On clotted earth are laid, nor know, When those who chase, and those who fly, With hasty feet come clatt'ring by, Or who hath won or who hath lost; Save when some dying Scotchman lifts his head, And, asking faintly how the day hath sped, At the glad news, half from the ground Starts up, and gives a cheering sound, And waves his hand and yields the ghost. A smile is on the corse's cheek, Stretch'd by the heather bush, on death-bed bare and bleak. XLVIII. With rueful eyes the wreck of that dire hour, The Southron's yet unbroken power, As on the river's adverse shore they stood, Silent beheld, till, like a mountain flood, Rush'd Stirling's castled warriors to the plain; Attack'd their now desponding force, And fiercely press'd their hasty course Back to their boasted native soil again. XLIX. Of foes so long detested,âfear'd, Were towns and castles quickly clear'd; Through all the land at will might free men range: Nor slave nor tyrant there appear'd; It was a blessed change! L. The peasant's cot and homely farm, Hall-house and tower, secure from harm Or lawless spoil, again became The cheerful charge of wife or dame. 'Neath humble roofs, from rafter slung The harmless spear, on which was hung The flaxen yarn in spindles coil'd, And leathern pouch and hosen soil'd, And rush or osier creel, that held Both field and household gear; whilst swell'd With store of Scotland's fav'rite food, The seemly sack in corner stood; Remains of what the foe had left; Glad sight to folks so long bereft! And look'd at oft and wisely spared, Though still with poorer neighbours shared. The wooden quaigh and trencher placed On the shelved wall, its rudeness graced. Beneath the pot red fagots glanced, And on the hearth the spindle danced, As housewife's slight, so finely true, The lengthen'd thread from distaff drew, While she, belike, sang ditty shrill Of Southron loons with lengthen'd trill. LI. In castle hall with open gate, The noble lady kept her state, With girdle clasp'd by gem of price, Buckle or hasp of rare device, Which held, constrain'd o'er bodice tight, Her woollen robe of colours bright; And with bent head and tranquil eye, And gesture of fair courtesy, The stranger guest bade to her board Though far a-field her warlike lord. A board where smoked on dishes clear Of massy pewter, sav'ry cheer, And potent ale was foaming seen O'er tankards bright of silver sheen, Which erst, when foemen bore the sway, Beneath the sod deep buried lay. For household goods, from many a hoard, Were now to household use restored. LII. Neighbours with neighbours join'd, begin Their cheerful toil, whilst mingled din Of saw or hammer cleave the air, The roofless bigging to repair, The woodman fells the gnarled tree, The ploughman whistles on the lea; The falc'ner keen his bird lets fly, As lordlings gaze with upcast eye; The arrow'd sportsman strays at will, And fearless roams o'er moor and hill; The traveller pricks along the plain; The herdboys shout and children play; Scotland is Scotland once again, And all are boon and gay. LIII. Thus, freedom from a grievous yoke, Like gleam of sunshine o'er them broke; And souls, when joy and peace were new, Of every nature, kindlier grew. It was a term of liberal dealing, And active hope and friendly feeling, Through all the land might freemen range, It was a blessed change! LIV. So, when through forest wild hath pass'd The mingled fray of shower and blast, Tissue of threaded gems is worn By flower and fern and briar and thorn, While the scourged oak and shaken pine, Aloft in brighten'd verdure shine. Then Wallace to St. Johnston went, And through the country quickly sent Summons to burgher, knight, and lord, Who, there convened, with one accord, Took solemn oath with short debate, Of fealty to the state, Until a king's acknowledged, rightful sway,â A native king, they should with loyal hearts obey. And he with foresight wise, to spare Poor Scotland, scourged, exhausted, bare, Whose fields unplough'd, and pastures scant, Had brought her hardy sons to want, His conquering army southward led, Which was on England's plenty fed: And there, I trow, for many months they took Spoil of the land which ill that hateful change could brook. LV. Edward, meantime, ashamed and wroth At such unseemly foil, and loath So to be bearded, sent defiance To Scotland's chief, in sure reliance That he, with all which he may southward bring, Of warlike force, dare not encounter England's king. LVI. But Wallace, on the day appointed, Before this scepter'd and anointed, Who, strengthen'd with a numerous host, There halted, to maintain his boast, On Stanmore's height, their battle ground, With all his valiant Scots was found. A narrow space of stony moor, With heath and lichens mottled o'er, And cross'd with dew-webs wiry sheen, The adverse armies lay between. When upland mists had worn away, And blue sky over-head was clearing, And things of distant ken appearing, Fair on the vision burst that martial grand array. The force on haughty Edward's side, Spearmen and archers were descry'd, Line beyond line, spread far and wide, Receding from the eye; While bristling pikes distinct and dark, As traced aloft with edgy mark, Seem'd graven on the sky; And armed knights arm'd steeds bestriding, Their morions glancing bright, And to and fro their gay squires riding In warlike gear bedight. O'er all the royal standard flew, With crimson folds of gorgeous hne, And near it, ranged, in colours gay, Inferior flags and banners play, As broad-wing'd hawk keeps soaring high, Circled by lesser birds, that wheeling round him fly. Huge waggon, sledded car, and wain, With dark, piled loads, a heavy train, Store-place of arms and yeoman's cheer, Frown'd in the further rear. LVII. And marshall'd on the northern side, The northern ranks the charge abide, In numbers few, but stout of heart, Their nation's honour to assert. LVIII. Thus on the field with clans and liegemen good, England's great King, and Scotland's Warden stood. That Monarch proud did rightly claim 'Mongst Europe's lords the fairest fame, And had, in cause of Christentie, Fought with bold Saracens right gallantly. That Warden was the noblest man That e'er graced nation, race, or clan, And grasp'd within his brave right hand A sword, which from the dust had raised his native land. LIX. Who had not cried, that look'd upon So brave and grand a sight, âWhat stalwart deeds shall here be done âBefore the close of night!â But Edward mark'd with falt'ring will, The Scottish battle ranged with skill, Which spoke the Leader's powerful mind. On England's host that number'd twice their foes, But newly raised, nor yet enured to blows, He rueful look'd, his purpose fail'd, He look'd again, his spirit quail'd, And battle-gage declined. LX. And thus did he to Wallace yield, The bloodless honours of the field. But as the Southron ranks withdraw, Scarcely believing what he saw, The wary Chief might not expose His soldiers to returning foes, Or ambush'd snare, and gave the order, With beat of drum and trumpet sounding, The air with joyous shouts resounding, To cross with homeward steps the English border. LXI. Scotland thus, from foes secure, Her prudent Chieftain, to enure His nobles still to martial toil, Sought contest on a distant soil: And many a young and valiant knight, For foreign wars were with their leader dight. And soon upon the seas careering In gallant ship, whose pennants play, Waving and curling in the air, With changeful hues of colour fair, Themselves as gallant, boon, and gay, Their course with fav'ring breezes steering, To friendly France they held their way. LXII. And they upon the ocean met With warlike fleet, and sails full set, De Longueville, that bold outlaw, Whose name kept mariners in awe. This man, with all his desp'rate crew Did Wallace on the waves subdue. One Scottish ship the pirate thought As on her boarded deck he fought, Cheer'd by his sea-mates' warlike cries, A sure and easy prize. But Wallace' mighty arm he felt: Yea, at his conqueror's feet he knelt; And there disdained not to crave And take the merey of the brave; For still, as thing by nature fit, The brave unto the brave are knit. Thus natives of one parent land, In crowded mart, on foreign strand, With quick glance recognize each other; âThat mien! that step! it is a brother! âThough mingled with a meaner race, âIn foreign garb, I know that face, âHis features beam like those I love, âHis limbs with mountain-vigour move, âAnd though so strange and alien grown, âThe kindred tie my soul will own.â De Longueville, e'en from that hour, a knight, True to his native King, true to the right, Fought with the Scottish hero to the end, In many a bloody field, his tried and valiant friend. LXIII. And nobly in the lists of France, Those noble Scots with brand and lance, 'Midst foreign knights and warriors blended, In generous rivalry contended, Whilst their brave Chieftain taught them still The soldier's dext'rous art and leader's nobler skill. LXIV. But English Edward, tired the while Of life inert and covert guile, Most faithless to the peace so lately made, Was northward bound again, poor Scotland to invade. Then Wallace, with his valiant band, By Scotland's faithful sons recall'd, Whom foreign yoke full sorely gall'd, Must raise again his glaved hand To smite the shackles from his native land. LXV. Brave hearts, who had in secret burn'd, To see their country bear the yoke, Hearing their Warden was return'd Forth from their secret hidings broke, Wood, cave, or mountain-cliff, and ran To join the wondrous man. LXVI. It was a sight to chase despair, His standard floating on the air, Which, curling oft with courteous wave, Still seem'd to beckon to the brave. And when approach'd within short space, They saw his form and knew his face,â That brow of hope, that step of power, Which stateliest strode in danger's hour,â How glow'd each heart!ââHimself we see! âWhat, though but few and spent we be! âThe valiant heart despaireth never; âThe rightful cause is strongest ever; âWhile Wallace lives, the land is free.â LXVII. And he this flatt'ring hope pursued, And war with England's King renew'd. By martial stratagem he took St. Johnston's stubborn town, a hold So oft to faithless tyrants sold; And cautious patriots then forsook Ignoble shelter, kept so long, And join'd in arms the ardent throng, Who with the Warden southward pass'd, Like clouds increasing on the blast. LXVIII. Fife from the enemy he won, And in his prosp'rous course held on, Till Edward's strength, borne quickly down, Held scarcely castle, tower, or town, In all the southern shires; and then He turn'd him to the north again; Where from each wall'd defence, the foe expell'd, Fled fast, Dundee alone still for King Edward held. LXIX. But the oppressor, blushing on his throne To see the Scotch his warriors homeward chase, And those, so lately crush'd, so powerful grown, But ill could brook this sudden foul disgrace. And he a base, unprincely compact made With the Red Comyn, traitor, black of heart! Who to their wicked plot, in secret laid, Some other chieftains gain'd with wily art. And he hath dared again to send A noble army, all too brave For such unmanly, hateful end, A land of freedom to enslave. At Falkirk soon was England's proudest boast Marshall'd in grand array, a brave and powerful host. LXX. But there with valiant foe to cope, Soon on the field stood Scotland's hope, E'en thirty thousand warriors, led By noble Wallace; each, that day, Had cheerfully his heart's blood shed The land to free from Southron's sway. Alas! had all her high-born chieftains been But as their leader and their clansmen true, She on that field a glorious day had seen, And made, though match'd with them, in number few, King Edward's vaunted host that fatal day to rue. LXXI. But envy of a hero's fame, Which so obscured each lofty name, Was meanly harbour'd in the breast Of those who bore an honour'd crest. But most of all Red Comyn nursed In his dark breast this bane accursed, That, with the lust of power combined, O'er-master'd all his wretched mind. Then to Lord Stewart, secretly, Spoke with smooth words the traitor sly, Advising that, to grace his name, Being by right confess'd the man, Who ought to lead the Scottish van, He should the proud distinction claim. And thus, as one of low estate, With lip of scorn, and brow elate, Did he, by traitors back'd, the godlike Wallace bate. LXXII. âMust noble chiefs of high degree, âScotland's best blood, be led by thee? âThou, who art great but as the owl, âWho plumed her wing from every fowl, âAnd, hooting on her blasted tree, âWould greater than the eagle be.â LXXIII. âI stood,â said Wallace, âfor the right, âWhen ye in holes shrank from the light; âMy plumes spread to the blazing sun âWhich coweringly ye sought to shun. âYe are the owls, who from the gloom âOf cleft and cranny boasting come; âYet, hoot and chatter as ye may, âI'll not to living man this day âResign the baton of command, âWhich Scotland's will gave to my hand, âWhen spoil'd, divided, conquer'd, maim'd, âNone the dangerous honour claim'd; âNor. till my head lie in the dust, âWill it betray her sacred trust.â LXXIV. With flashing eye, and dark red brow, He utter'd then a hasty vow, Seeing the snare by treason laid, So strongly wov'n, so widely spread, And slowly from the field withdrew; While, slow and silent at his back, March'd on his wayward, cheerless track, Ten thousand Scotchmen staunch and true, Who would, let good or ill betide, By noble Wallace still abide. LXXV. To them it was a strange and irksome sight, As on a gentle hill apart they stood, To see arm'd squadrons closing in the fight, And the fierce onset to their work of blood. To see their well-known banners as they moved When dark opposing ranks with ranks are blending, To see the lofty plumes of those they loved Wave to and fro, with the brave foe contending. LXXVI. It hath been said that gifted seer, On the dark mountain's cloudy screen, Forms of departed chiefs hath seen, In seeming armour braced with sword and spear, O'erlooking some dire field of death, Where warriors, warm with vital breath, Of kindred lineage, urge the glorious strife; They grasp their shadowy spears, and forward bend In eager sympathy, as if to lend Their aid to those, with whom in mortal life, They did such rousing, noble conflict share,â As if their phantom-forms of empty air Still own'd a kindred sense of what on earth they were. LXXVII. So Wallace and his faithful band survey'd The fatal fight, when Scotland was betray'd By the false Comyn, who most basely fled, And from the field a thousand warriors led. O how his noble spirit burn'd, When from his post the traitor turn'd, Leaving the Stewart sorely prest! Who with his hardy Scots the wave Of hostile strength did stoutly breast, Like clansmeu true and brave. His visage flush'd with angry glow, He clench'd his hand, and struck his brow. His heart within his bosom beat As it would break from mortal seat. And when at last they yielded space, And ye beheld their piteous case, Big scalding tears coursed down his manly face. LXXVIII. But, ah! that fatal vow, that pride Which doth in mortal breast reside, Of noble minds the earthly bane, His gen'rous impulse to restrain, Had power in that dark moment! still It struggled with his better will. And who, superior to this tempter's power, Hath ever braved it in the trying hour? Oh! only he, who, strong in heavenly grace, Taking from wretched thralls, of woman born, Their wicked mockery, their stripes, their scorn, Gave his devoted life for all the human race. He viewed the dire disastrous fight, Like a fall'n cherub of the light, Whose tossing form now tow'rs, now bends, And with its darken'd self contends, Till many a brave and honour'd head Lay still'd upon a bloody bed, And Stewart, midst his clans, was number'd with the dead. LXXIX. Then rose he, like a rushing wind, Which strath or cavern hath confin'd, And straight through England's dark array, With his bold mates, hew'd out his bloody way: A perilous daring way, and dear the cost! For there the good, the gallant Grame he lost. The gallant Grame, whose name shall long Remember'd be in Scottish song. And second still to Wallace wight In lowland tale of winter's night, Who loved him as he never loved another. Low to the dust he bent his head, Deep was his anguish o'er the dead.â âThat daring hand, that gentle heart! âThat lofty mind! and must we part? âMy brother, oh, my brother!â LXXX. But how shall verse feign'd accents borrow, To speak with words their speechless sorrow, Who, on the trampled, blood-stain'd green Of battle-field, must leave behind What to their souls hath dearest been, To stiffen in the wind? The soldier there, or kern or chief, Short parley holds with shrewdest grief; Passing to noisy strife from what, alas! Shall from his sadden'd fancy never pass,â The look that e'en through writhing pain, Says, âShall we never meet again?â The grasping hand or sign but known, Of tenderness, to one alone: The lip convulsed, the life's last shiver; The new-closed eye, yet closed for ever, The brave must quit;âbut, from the ground, They, like th' enchafed lion bound. Rage is their sorrow, grimly fed, And blood the tears they shed. LXXXI. Too bold it were for me to tell, How Wallace fought; how on the brave The ruin of his anguish fell, Ere from the field, his bands to save, He broke away, and sternly bore Along the stony Carron's shore. The dark brown water, hurrying past, O'er stone and rocky fragment cast The white churn'd foam with angry bray, And wheel'd and bubbled on its way, And lash'd the margin's flinty guard, By him unheeded and unheard! Albeit, his mind, dark with despair, And grief, and rage, was imaged there. LXXXII. And there, 'tis said, the Bruce descried Him marching on the rival side. The Bruce, whose right the country own'd, (Had he possess'd a princely soul. Disdaining Edward's base controul,) To be upon her chair of power enthron'd. LXXXIII. âHo, chieftain!â said the princely slave, âThou who pretendst the land to save âWith rebel sword, opposed to me, âWho should of right thy sovereign be; âThinkst thou the Scottish crown to wear, âOpposed by foreign power so great, âBy those at home of high estate? âCast the vain thought to empty air, âThy fatal mad ambition to despair.â LXXXIV. âNo!â Wallace answer'd; âI have shown âThis sword to gain or power or throne âWas never drawn; no act of mine âDid e'er with selfish thought combine. âCourage to dare, when others lay âIn brutish sloth, beneath the sway âOf foreign tyranny; to save âFrom thraldom, hateful to the brave, âMy friends, my countrymen; to stand âFor right and honour of the land, âWhen nobler arms shrank from the task, âIn a vile tyrant's smiles to bask, âHath been my simple warrant of command. âAnd Scotland hath confirm'd it.âNo; âNor shall this hand her charge forego, âWhile Southron in the land is found âTo lord it o'er one rood of Scottish ground, âOr till my head be low.â LXXXV. Deep blush'd the Bruce, shame's conscious glow! And own'd the hero's words were true; Then with his followers, sad and slow, To Edward's camp withdrew. LXXXVI. But fleeting was the mighty tyrant's boast, (So says the learned clerk of old, Who first our hero's story told,) Fleeting the triumph of his numerous host. For with the morning's early dawn The Scottish soldiers, scatter'd wide, Hath Wallace round his standard drawn, Hath cheer'd their spirits, roused their pride, And led them, where their foes they found, All listless, scatter'd on the ground. On whom with furious charge they set; And many a valiant Southron met A bloody death, waked from the gleam And inward vision of a morning's dream; Where Fancy in his native home Led him through well-known fields to roam, Where orchard, cot, and copse appear, And moving forms of kindred dear;â For in the rugged soldier's brain She oft will fairy court maintain Full gently, as beneath the dusk Of hard-ribb'd shell, the fair pearl lies, Or silken bud in prickly husk;â He from her visions sweet unseals his eyes To see the stern foe o'er him darkly bending, To feel the deep-thrust blade his bosom rending. LXXXVII. So many Southrons there were slain, So fatal was the vengeance ta'en, That Edward, with enfeebled force, Check'd mad ambition's unbless'd course, And to his own fair land return'd again. LXXXVIII. Then Wallace thought from tower and town And castled hold, as heretofore, To pull each English banner down And free the land once more. But ah! the generous hope he must forego! Envy and pride have Scotland's cause betray'd; All now are backward, listless, cold, and slow His patriot arm to aid. LXXXIX. Then to St. Johnston, at his call, Met burghers, knights, and nobles all, Who on the pressing summons wait, A full assembly of the state. There he resign'd his ensigns of command, Which erst had kept the proudest Thanes in awe; Retaining in that potent hand Which thrice redeem'd its native land, His simple sword alone, with which he stood 'Midst all her haughty peers of princely blood, The noblest man e'er Scotland saw. XC. And thus did Scottish lords requite Him, who, in many a bloody fight, The country's champion stood; her people's Wallace wight. O black ingratitude! thy seemly place Is in the brutish, mean, and envious heart; How is it, then, thou dost so oft disgrace The learn'd, the wise, the highly born, and art Like cank'ring blights, the oak that scathe, While fern and brushwood thrive beneath; Like dank mould on the marble tomb, While graves of turf with violets bloom. Selfish ambition makes the lordliest Thane A meaner man than he, who drives the loaded wain. XCI. And he with heavy heart his native shore Forsook to join his old ally once more. And in Guienne right valiant deeds he wrought; Till under iron yoke oppress'd, From north to south, from east to west, His most unhappy groaning country sought The generous aid she never sought in vain; And with a son's unwearied love, Which fortune, time, nor wrongs could move, He to maintain her cause again repass'd the main. The which right bravely he maintain'd; And divers castles soon regain'd. The sound e'en of his whisper'd name Revived in faithful hearts the smother'd flame, And many secretly to join his standard came. St. Johnston's leaguer'd walls at length Were yielded to his growing strength; And on, with still increasing force, He southward held his glorious course. XCII. Then Edward thought the chief to gain, And win him to his princely side With treasured gold and honours vain, And English manors fair and wide. But with flush'd brow and angry eye And words that shrewdly from him broke, Stately and stern, he thus bespoke The secret embassy. âThese kingly proffers made to me! âReturn and say it may not be. âLions shall troop with herdsmen's droves, âAnd eagles roost with household doves, âEre William Wallace draw his blade âWith those who Scotland's rights invade. âYea, e'en the touch of bondsman's chain, âWould in my thrilling members wake âA loathful sense of rankling pain âLike coiling of a venom'd snake.â The King abash'd, in courtly hold, Received this answer sooth and bold. XCIII. But ah! the fated hour drew near That stopp'd him in his bold career. Menteith, a name which from that day, I ween, Hateful to ever Scottish ear hath been, Which highland kern and lowland hind Have still with treacherous guile combined,â The false Menteith, who under show Of friendship, sold him to the foe, Stole on a weary secret hour, As sleeping and disarm'd he lay, And to King Edward's vengeful power Gave up the mighty prey. XCIV. At sight of noble Wallace bound, The Southrons raised a vaunting sound, As if the bands which round his limbs they drew, Had fetter'd Scotland too. They gazed and wonder'd at their mighty thrall; Then nearer drew with movements slow, And spoke in whispers deep and low.â âThis is the man to whom did yield âThe doughtiest knight in banner'd field, âWhose threat'ning frown the boldest did appal!â And, as his clanging fetters shook, Cast on him oft a fearful look, As doubting if in verity Such limbs with iron might holden be. While boldest spearmen by the pris'ner's side With beating heart and haggard visage ride. XCV. Thus on to London they have pass'd And in the Tower's dark dungeons cast The hero; where, in silent gloom, He must abide his fatal doom. There pent, from earthly strife apart, Scotland still rested on his heart. Ay; every son that breathed her air On cultured plain, on mountain bare, From chief in princely castle bred To herdsman in his sheeling shed, From war-dight youth to barefoot child, Who picks in brake the berry wild;â Her gleamy lakes and torrents clear, Her towns, her towers, her forests green, Her fields where warlike coil hath been, Are to his soul most dear. XCVI. His fetter'd hands support a head, Whose nodding plume had terror spread O'er many a face, e'en seen from far, When moving in the ranks of war. Lonely and dark, unseen of man, But in that Presence, whose keen eye Can darkest breast of mortal scan, The bitter thought and heavy sigh Have way uncheck'd, and utter'd grief Gave to his burthen'd heart a soothing, sad relief. XCVII. âIt hath not to this arm been given âFrom the fell tyrant's grinding hand âTo set thee free, my native land! âI bow me to the will of Heaven! âBut have I run my course in vain? âShalt thou in bondage still remain? âThe spoiler o'er thee still have sway, âTill virtue, strength, and pride decay? âO no! still panting to be free, âThy noblest hearts will think of me. âSome brave, devoted, happier son âWill do the work I would have done; âAnd blest be he, who nobly draws âHis sword in Scotland's cause!â XCVIII. Perhaps his vision'd eye might turn To him who fought at Bannockburn. Or is it wildness to believe A dying patriot may receive, (Who sees his mortal span diminish'd To nought, his generous task unfinish'd,) A seeming fruitless end to cheer, Some glimpses of the gifted seer? O no! 'tis to his closing sight A beacon on a distant height,â The moon's new crescent, seen in cloudy kirtled noght. XCIX. And much he strove with Christian grace, Of those who Scotland's foes had been, His soul's strong hatred to efface, A work of grace, I ween! Meekly he bow'd o'er bead and book, And every worldly thought forsook. C. But when he on the scaffold stood, And cast aside his mantling hood, He eyed the crowd, whose sullen hum, Did from ten thousand upcast faces come, And armed guardsmen standing round, As he was wont on battle-ground, Where still with calm and portly air, He faced the foe with visage bare; As if with baton of command And vassal chiefs on either hand, Towering her marshall'd files between, He Scotland's warden still had been. This flash of mortal feeling past,â This gleam of pride, it was the last. As on the cloud's dense skirt will play, While the dark tempest rolls away, One parting blaze; then thunders cease, The sky is clear, and all is peace. And he with ready will a nobler head Than e'er was circled with a kingly crown, Upon the block to headsman's stroke laid down, And for his native land a generous victim bled. CI. What though that head o'er gate or tower, Like felons on the cursed tree, Visited by sun and shower, A ghastly spectacle may be! A fair renown, as years wear on, Shall Scotland give her noblest son. The course of ages shall not dim The love that she shall bear to him. CII. In many a castle, town, and plain, Mountain and forest, still remain Fondly cherish'd spots, which claim The proud distinction of his honour'd name. CIII. Swells the huge ruin's massy heap In castled court, 'tis Wallace' keep. What stateliest o'er the rest may lower Of time-worn wall, where rook and daw, With wheeling flight and ceaseless caw, Keep busy stir, is Wallace' tower. If through the green wood's hanging screen, High o'er the deeply-bedded wave, The mouth of arching cleft is seen Dark yawning, it is Wallace' cave. If o'er its jutting barrier grey, Tinted by time, with furious din, The rude crags silver'd with its spray, Shoots the wild flood, 'tis Wallace' lin. And many a wood remains, and hill, and glen Haunted, 'tis said, of old by Wallace and his men. CIV. There schoolboy still doth haunt the sacred ground, And musing oft its pleasing influence own, As starting at his footsteps' echo'd sound, He feels himself alone. CV. Yea, e'en the cottage matron, at her wheel, Although with daily care and labour crost, Will o'er her heart the soothing magic feel, And of her country's ancient prowess boast; While on the little shelf of treasured books, For what can most of all her soul delight, Beyond or ballad, tale, or jest, she looks,â The history renown'd of Wallace wight. CVI. But chiefly to the soldier's breast A thought of him will kindling come, As waving high his bonnet's crest, He listens to the rolling drum, And trumpet's call and thrilling fife, And bagpipe's loud and stormy strain, Meet prelude to tumultuous strife On the embattled plain. CVII. Whether in highland garb array'd, With kirtle short and highland plaid, Or button'd close in lowland vest, Within his doughty grasp, broad sword, or gun be press'd,â Rememb'ring him, he still maintains His country's cause on foreign plains, To grace her name and earn her praise, Led by the brave of modern days. CVIII. Such, Abercrombie, fought with thee On Egypt's dark embattled shore, And near Corunna's bark-clad sea With great and gallant Moore; With Baird, with Ferguson, and Grame, A leader worthy of the name, And fought in pride of Scotland's ancient fame With firmer nerve and warmer will: And wheresoe'er on hostile ground, Or Scot or hardy Celt are found, Thy spirit, noble Wallace, fighteth still! CXIX. O Scotland! proud may be thy boast! Since Time his course through circling years hath run, There hath not shone, in Fame's bright host, A nobler hero than thy patriot son. CX. Manly and most devoted was the love With which for thee unweariedly he strove; No selfish lust of power, not e'en of fame, Gave ardour to the pure and generous flame. Rapid in action, terrible in fight, In counsel wise, inflexible in right, Was he, who did so oft, in olden days, Thy humbled head from base oppression raise. Then be it by thy generous spirit known, Ready in freedom's cause to bleed, Spurning corruption's worthless meed, That in thy heart thou feelst this hero was thine own! THE LEGEND OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. Is there a man, that, from some lofty steep, Views in his wide survey the boundless deep, When its vast waters, lined with sun and shade, Wave beyond wave, in serried distance, fade To the pale sky;âor views it, dimly seen, The shifting skreens of drifted mist between, As the huge cloud dilates its sable form, When grandly curtain'd by th' approaching storm,â Who feels not his awed soul with wonder rise To Him whose power created sea and skies, Mountains and deserts, giving to the sight The wonders of the day and of the night? But let some fleet be seen in warlike pride, Whose stately ships the restless billows ride, While each, with lofty masts and bright'ning sheen, Of fair spread sails, moves like a vested queen;â Or rather, be some distant bark, astray, Seen like a pilgrim on his lonely way, Holding its steady course from port and shore, A form distinct, a speck, and seen no more,â How doth the pride, the sympathy, the flame, Of human feeling stir his thrilling frame! âO Thou! whose mandate dust inert obey'd! âWhat is this creature man whom Thou hast made?â I. On Palos' shore, whose crowded strand Bore priests and nobles of the land, And rustic hinds and townsmen trim, And harness'd soldiers stern and grim, And lowly maids and dames of pride, And infants by their mothers' side,â The boldest seaman stood that e'er Did bark or ship through tempest steer; And wise as bold, and good as wise; The magnet of a thousand eyes, That on his form and features cast, His noble mien and simple guise, In wonder seem'd to look their last: A form which conscious worth is gracing, A face where hope, the lines effacing Of thought and care, bestow'd, in truth, To the quick eyes' imperfect tracing The look and air of youth. II. Who, in his lofty gait, and high Expression of th' enlighten'd eye, Had recognised in that bright hour The disappointed suppliant of dull power, Who had in vain of states and kings desired The pittance for his vast emprise required?â The patient sage, who, by his lamp's faint light, O'er chart and map spent the long silent night?â The man who meekly fortune's buffets bore, Trusting in One alone, whom heaven and earth adore? III. Another world is in his mind, Peopled with creatures of his kind, With hearts to feel, with minds to soar, Thoughts to consider and explore; Souls, who might find, from trespass shriven, Virtue on earth and joy in heaven. That Power divine, whom storms obey, (Whisper'd his heart,) a leading star, Will guide him on his blessed way; Brothers to join, by fate divided far. Vain thoughts! which heaven doth but ordain In part to be, the rest, alas! how vain! IV. But hath there lived of mortal mould, Whose fortunes with his thoughts could hold An even race? Earth's greatest son That e'er earn'd fame, or empire won, Hath but fulfill'd, within a narrow scope, A stinted portion of his ample hope. With heavy sigh and look depress'd, The greatest men will sometimes hear The story of their acts address'd To the young stranger's wond'ring ear, And check the half-swoln tear. Is it or modesty or pride Which may not open praise abide? No; read his inward thoughts: they tell, His deeds of fame he prizes well. But, ah! they in his fancy stand, As relies of a blighted band, Who, lost to man's approving sight, Have perish'd in the gloom of night; Ere yet the glorious light of day Had glitter'd on their bright array. His mightiest feat had once another, Of high Imagination born,â A loftier and a nobler brother, From dear existence torn; And she for those, who are not, steeps Her soul in woe,âlike Rachel, weeps. V. The signal given, with hasty strides The sailors climb'd their ships' dark sides; Their anchors weigh'd; and from the shore Each stately vessel slowly bore. High o'er the deeply shadow'd flood, Upon his deck their leader stood, And turn'd him to the parted land, And bow'd his head and waved his hand. And then, along the crowded strand, A sound of many sounds combined, That wax'd and waned upon the wind, Burst like heaven's thunder, deep and grand; A lengthen'd peal, which paused, and then Renew'd, like that which loathly parts, Oft on the ear return'd again, The impulse of a thousand hearts; But as the lengthen'd shouts subside, Distincter accents strike the ear, Wafting across the current wide, Heart-utter'd words of parting cheer: âOh! shall we ever see again âThose gallant souls re-cross the main? âGod keep the brave! God be their guide! âGod bear them safe through storm and tide! âTheir sails with fav'ring breezes swell! âO brave Columbus! fare thee well!â VI. From shore and strait, and gulph and bay, The vessels held their daring way, Left far behind, in distance thrown, All land to Moor or Christian known, Left far behind the misty isle, Whose fitful shroud, withdrawn the while, Shows wood and hill and headland bright To later seamen's wond'ring sight, And tide and sea left far behind That e'er bore freight of human kind; Where ship or bark to shifting gales E'er tack'd their course or spread their sails. Around them lay a boundless main In which to hold their silent reign; But for the passing current's flow, And cleft waves, brawling round the prow, They might have thought some magic spell Had bound them, weary fate! for ever there to dwell. VII. What did this trackless waste supply To soothe the mind or please the eye? The rising morn through dim mist breaking, The flicker'd east with purple streaking; The mid-day cloud through thin air flying, With deeper blue the blue sea dying; Long ridgy waves their white manes rearing, And in the broad gleam disappearing; The broaden'd blazing sun declining, And western waves like fire-flood shining; The sky's vast dome to darkness given, And all the glorious host of heaven. VIII. Full oft upon the deck, while others slept, To mark the bearing of each well-known star That shone aloft, or on th' horizon far, The anxious Chief his lonely vigil kept; The mournful wind, the hoarse wave breaking near, The breathing groans of sleep, the plunging lead, The steersman's call, and his own stilly tread, Are all the sounds of night that reach his ear. His darker form stalk'd through the sable gloom With gestures discomposed and features keen, That might not in the face of day be seen, Like some unblessed spirit from the tomb. Night after night, and day succeeding day, So pass'd their dull, unvaried time away; Till Hope, the seaman's worship'd queen, had flown From every valiant heart but his alone; Where still, by day, enthroned, she held her state With sunny look and brow elate. IX. But soon his dauntless soul, which nought could bend, Nor hope delay'd, nor adverse fate subdue, With more redoubled danger must contend Than storm or waveâa fierce and angry crew. âDearly,â say they, âmay we those visions rue âWhich lured us from our native land, âA wretched, lost, devoted band, âLed on by hope's delusive gleam, âThe victims of a madman's dream; âNor gold shall e'er be ours, nor fame; âNot e'en the remnant of a name, âOn some rude-letter'd stone to tell âOn what strange coast our wreck befell. âFor us no requiem shall be sung, âNor prayer be said, nor passing knell âIn holy church be rung.â X. To thoughts like these, all forms give way Of duty to a leader's sway; All habits of respect, that bind With easy tie the human mind. E'en love and admiration throw Their nobler bands aside, nor show A gentler mien; relations, friends, Glare on him now like angry fiends; And, as he moves, ah, wretched cheer! Their mutter'd curses reach his ear, But all undaunted, firm and sage, He scorns their threats, yet thus he soothes their rage: âI brought you from your native shore âAn unknown ocean to explore. âI brought you, partners, by my side, âWant, toil, and danger, to abide. âYet weary stillness hath so soon subdued âThe buoyant soul, the heart of pride, âMen who in battle's brunt full oft have firmly stood. âThat to some nearing coast we bear, âHow many cheering signs declare! âWay-faring birds the blue air ranging, âTheir shadowy line to blue air changing, âPass o'er our heads in frequent flocks; âWhile sea-weed from the parent rocks âWith fibry roots, but newly torn, âIn tressy lengthen'd wreaths are on the clear wave borne. âNay, has not e'en the drifting current brought âThings of rude art,âof human cunning wrought? âBe yet two days your patience tried, âAnd if no shore be then descried, âE'en turn your dastard prows again, âAnd cast your leader to the main.â XI. And thus awhile with steady hand He kept in check a wayward band, Who but with half-express'd disdain Their rebel spirit could restrain. The vet'ran rough as war-worn steel, Oft spurn'd the deck with grating heel; The seaman, bending o'er the flood, With stony gaze all listless stood; The sturdy bandit, wildly rude, Sang, as he strode, some garbled strain, Expressive of each fitful mood. Timed by his sabre's jangling chain The proud Castilian, boasted name! Child of an ancient race Which proudly prized its spotless fame, And deem'd all fear disgrace, Felt quench'd within him honour's generous flame, And in his gather'd mantle wrapp'd his face. XII. So pass'd the day, the night, the second day With its red setting sun's extinguish'd ray. Dark, solemn midnight coped the ocean wide, When from his watchful stand Columbus cried, âA light, a light!ââblest sounds that rang In every ear.âAt once they sprang With haste aloft, and, peering bright, Descried afar the blessed sight. âIt moves, it slowly moves, like ray âOf torch that guides some wand'rer's way! âAnd other lights more distant, seeming âAs if from town or hamlet streaming! â'Tis land, 'tis peopled land; man dwelleth there, âAnd thou, O God of Heaven! hast heard thy servant's prayer!â XIII. Returning day gave to their view The distant shore and headlands blue Of long-sought land. Then rose on air Loud shouts of joy, mix'd wildly strange With voice of weeping and of prayer, Expressive of their blessed change From death to life, from fierce to kind, From all that sinks, to all that elevates the mind. Those who by faithless fear ensnared, Had their brave chief so rudely dared, Now, with keen self-upbraiding stung, With every manly feeling wrung, Repentant tears, looks that entreat, Are kneeling at his worship'd feet. âO pardon blinded, stubborn guilt! âO henceforth make us what thou wilt! âOur hands, our hearts, our lives are thine, âThou wondrous man! led on by power divine!â XIV. Ah! would some magie could arrest The generous feelings of the breast, Which 'thwart the common baser mass Of sordid thoughts, so fleetly pass,â A sun glimpse through the storm! The rent cloud closes, tempests swell, And its late path we cannot tell; Lost is its trace and form. No; not on earth such fugitives are bound; In some veil'd future state will the bless'd charm be found. XV. Columbus led them to the shore, Which ship had never touch'd before; And there he knelt upon the strand To thank the God of sea and land; And there, with mien and look elate, Gave welcome to each toil-worn mate. And lured with courteous signs of cheer, The dusky natives gath'ring near; Who on them gazed with wond'ring eyes, As mission'd spirits from the skies. And there did he possession claim, In Isabella's royal name. XVI. It was a land, unmarr'd by art, To please the eye and cheer the heart: The natives' simple huts were seen Peeping their palmy groves between,â Groves, where each dome of sweepy leaves In air of morning gently heaves, And, as the deep vans fall and rise, Changes its richly verdant dies; A land whose simple sons till now Had scarcely seen a careful brow; They spent at will each passing day In lightsome toil or active play. Some their light canoes were guiding, Along the shore's sweet margin gliding. Some in the sunny sea were swimming, The bright waves o'er their dark forms gleaming; Some on the beach for shell-fish stooping Or on the smooth sand gaily trooping; Or in link'd circles featly dancing With golden braid and bracelet glancing. By shelter'd door were infants creeping, Or on the shaded herbage sleeping; Gay feather'd birds the air were winging, And parrots on their high perch swinging, While humming-birds, like sparks of light, Twinkled and vanish'd from the sight. XVII. They eyed the wondrous strangers o'er and o'er,â Those beings of the ocean and the air, With humble, timid rev'rence; all their store Of gather'd wealth inviting them to share; To share whate'er their lowly cabins hold; Their feather'd crowns, their fruits, their arms, their gold. Their gold, that fatal gift!âO foul disgrace! Repaid with cruel wreck of all their harmless race. XVIII. There some short, pleasing days with them he dwelt, And all their simple kindness dearly felt, But they of other countries told, Not distant, where the sun declines, Where reign Caziques o'er warriors bold, Rich with the gold of countless mines. And he to other islands sail'd, And was by other natives hail'd. Then on Hispaniola's shore, Where bays and harbours to explore Much time he spent, a simple tower Of wood he built, the seat to be And shelter of Spain's infant power; Hoping the nurseling fair to see, Amidst those harmless people shoot Its stately stem from slender root. There nine and thirty chosen men he placed, Gave parting words of counsel and of cheer; One after one his nobler friends embraced, And to the Indian chieftain, standing near, âBefriend my friends, and give them aid, âWhen I am gone,â he kindly said, Bless'd them, and left them there his homeward course to steer. XIX. His prayer to heaven for them preferr'd Was not, alas! with favour heard. Oft, as his ship the land forsook, He landward turn'd his farewell look, And cheer'd his Spaniards cross the wave, Who distant answer faintly gave; Distant but cheerful. On the strand He saw their clothed figures stand With naked forms link'd hand in hand;â Saw thus caress'd, assured, and bold, Those he should never more behold. Some simple Indians, gently won, To visit land, where sets the sun In clouds of amber, and behold, The wonders oft by Spaniards told; Stood silent by themselves apart, With nature's yearnings at their heart, And saw the coast of fading blue Wear soft and sadly from their view. But soon by their new comrades cheer'd, As o'er the waves the ship career'd, Their wond'ring eyes aloft were cast On white swoln sails and stately mast, And check'ring shrouds, depicted fair, On azure sea and azure air; And felt, as feels the truant boy, Who, having climb'd some crumbling mound Or ruin'd tower, looks wildly round,â A thrilling, fearful joy. XX. Then with his two small barks again The dauntless Chief traversed the main; But not with fair and fav'ring gales That erst had fill'd his western sails: Fierce winds with adverse winds contended; Rose the dark deep,âdark heaven descended, And threaten'd, in the furious strife, The ships to sink with all their freight of precious life. XXI. In this dread case, well may be guess'd What dismal thoughts his soul depress'd: âAnd must I in th' o'erwhelming deep, âOur bold achievement all unknown, âWith these my brave adventurers sleep,â âWhat we have done to dark oblivion thrown? âSink, body! to thy wat'ry grave, âIf so God will; but let me save âThis noble fruitage of my mind, âAnd leave my name and decds behind!â XXII. Upon a scroll, with hasty pen, His wondrous tale he traced, View'd it with tearful eyes, and then Within a casket placed. âPerhaps,â said he, âby vessel bound âOn western cruize thou wilt be found; âOr make, sped by the current swift, âTo Christian shore thy happy drift. âThy story may by friendly eyes be read; âO'er our untimely fate warm tears be shed; âOur deeds rehearsed by many an eager tongue, âAnd requiems for our parted souls be sung.â This casket to the sea he gave; Quick sank and rose the freightage light,â Appear'd on many a booming wave, Then floated far away from his still gazing sight. Yet after many a peril braved,â Of many an adverse wind the sport, He, by his Great Preserver saved, Anchor'd again in Palos' port. XXIII. O, who can tell the acclamation loud That, bursting, rose from the assembled crowd, To hail the Hero and his gallant train, From such adventure bold return'd again!â The warm embrace, the oft-repeated cheer, And many a wistful smile and many a tear! How, pressing close, they stood; Look'd on Columbus with amaze,â âIs he,â so spake their wond'ring gaze, âA man of flesh and blood?â While cannon far along the shore His welcome gave with deaf'ning roar. XXIV. And then with measured steps, sedate and slow, They to the Christian's sacred temple go. Soon as the chief within the house of God Upon the hallow'd pavement trode, He bow'd with holy fear:â âThe God of wisdom, merey, might, âCreator of the day and night, âThis sea-girt globe, and every star of light, âIs worship'd here.â Then on the altar's steps he knelt, And what his inward spirit felt, Was said unheard within that cell Where saintly thoughts and feelings dwell; But as the choral chaunters raise Through dome and aisle the hymn of praise, To heaven his glist'ning eyes were turn'd, With sacred love his bosom burn'd. On all the motley crowd The gen'rous impulse seized; high Dons of pride Wept like the meekest beadsman by their side, And women sobb'd aloud. XXV. Nor statesmen met in high debate Deciding on a country's fate, Nor saintly chiefs with fearless zeal Contending for their churches' weal, Nor warriors, 'midst the battle's roar, Who fiercely guard their native shore;â No power by earthly coil possest To agitate the human breast, Shows, from its native source diverted, Man's nature noble, though perverted, So strongly as the transient power Of link'd devotion's sympathetic hour. It clothes with soft unwonted grace The traits of many a rugged face, As bend the knees unused to kneel, And glow the hearts unused to feel; While every soul, with holy passion moved, Claims one Almighty Sire, fear'd, and adored, and loved. XXVI. With western treasures, borne in fair display, To Barcelona's walls, in grand array, Columbus slowly held his inland way. And still where'er he pass'd along, In eager crowds the people throng. The wildest way o'er desert drear Did like a city's mart appear. The shepherd swain forsook his sheep; The goat-herd from his craggy steep Shot like an arrow to the plain; Mechanics, housewives, left amain Their broken tasks, and press'd beside The truant youth they meant to chide: The dull Hidalgo left his tower, The donna fair her latticed bower; Together press'd, fair and uncouth, All motley forms of age and youth. And, still along the dark-ranged pile Of clust'ring life, was heard the while Mix'd brawling joy, and shouts that rung From many a loud and deaf'ning tongue. Ah! little thought the gazing throng, As pass'd that pageant show along, How Spain should rue, in future times, With desert plains and fields untill'd, And towns with listless loit'rers fill'd, The with'ring spoil received from foreign climes! Columbus gave thee, thankless Spain! A new-found world o'er which to reign; But could not with the gift impart A portion of his liberal heart And manly mind, to bid thee soar Above a robber's lust of ore, Which hath a curse entail'd on all thy countless store. XXVII. To Barcelona come, with honours meet Such glorious deeds to grace, his sov'reigns greet Their mariner's return. Or hall, Or room of state was deem'd too small For such reception. Pageant rare! Beneath heaven's dome, in open square, Their gorgeous thrones were placed; And near them on a humbler seat, While on each hand the titled great, Standing in dizen'd rows, were seen, Priests, guards, and crowds, a living screen,â Columbus sat, with noble mien, With princely honours graced. There to the royal pair his tale he told: A wondrous tale, that did not want Or studied words or braggart's vaunt; When at their royal feet were laid Gems, pearls, and plumes of many a shade, And stores of virgin gold, Whilst, in their feather'd guise array'd, The Indians low obeisance paid. And at that wondrous story's close The royal pair with rev'rence rose, And kneeling on the ground, aloud Gave thanks to heaven. Then all the crowd, Joining from impulse of the heart The banded priests' ecstatic art, With mingled voice Te Deum sang; With the grand choral burst, walls, towers, and welkin rang. XXVIII. This was his brightest hour, too bright For human weal;âa glaring light, Like sunbeam through the rent cloud pouring On the broad lake, when storms are roaring; Bright centre of a wild and sombre scene; More keenly bright than Summer's settled sheen. XXIX. With kingly favour brighten'd, all His favour court, obey his call. At princely boards, above the rest, He took his place, admired, caress'd: Proud was the don of high degree, Whose honour'd guest he deign'd to be. Whate'er his purposed service wanted With ready courtesy was granted: No envious foe durst cross his will. While eager shipwrights ply their skill, To busy dock-yard, quay, or port, Priests, lords, and citizens resort: There wains the heavy planks are bringing, And hammers on the anvil ringing, The far-toss'd boards on boards are falling, And brawny mate to work-mate calling: The cable strong on windlass winding; On wheel of stone the edge-tool grinding; Red fire beneath the caldron gleaming, And pitchy fumes from caldron steaming. To sea and land's men too, I ween, It was a gay, attractive scene; Beheld, enjoy'd, day after day, Till all his ships, in fair array, Were bounden for their course at last; And amply stored and bravely mann'd Bore far from blue, receding land. Thus soon again, th' Atlantic vast With gallant fleet he past. XXX. By peaceful natives hail'd with kindly smiles, He shortly touch'd at various pleasant isles; And when at length her well-known shore appear'd, And he to fair Hispaniola near'd, Upon the deck, with eager eye, Some friendly signal to descry, He stood; then fired his signal shot, But answ'ring fire received not. âWhat may this dismal silence mean? âNo floating flag in air is seen, âNor e'en the tower itself, though well âIts lofty site those landmarks tell. âHa! have they so regardless proved âOf my command?âtheir station moved!â As closer to the shore they drew, To hail them came no light canoe; The beach was silent and forsaken: Nor clothed nor naked forms appear'd, Nor sound of human voice was heard; Nought but the sea-birds from the rock With busy stir that flutt'ring broke; Sad signs, which in his mind portentous fears awaken. XXXI. Then eagerly on shore he went, His scouts abroad for tidings sent; But to his own loud echo'd cry An Indian came with fearful eye, Who guess'd his questions' hurried sound, And pointed to a little mound, Not distant far. With eager haste The loosen'd mould aside was cast. Bodies, alas! within that grave were found, Which had not long been laid to rest, Though so by changeful death defaced, Nor form, nor visage could be traced,â In Spanish garments dress'd. Back from each living Spaniard's cheek the blood Ran chill, as round their noble chief they stood, Who sternly spoke to check the rising tear. âEight of my valiant men are buried here; âWhere are the rest?â the timid Indian shook In every limb, and slow and faintly spoke. âSome are dead, some sick, some flown; âThe rest are up the country gone, âFar, far away.â A heavy groan Utters the chief; his blanch'd lips quiver; He knows that they are gone for ever. XXXII. But here 'twere tedious and unmeet A dismal story to repeat, Which was from mild Cazique received, Their former friend, and half believed. Him, in his cabin far apart. Wounded they found, by Carib dart; Received, said he, from savage foe Spaniards defending. Then with accents low He spoke, and ruefully began to tell, What to those hapless mariners befell. How that from lust of pleasure and of gold, And mutual strife and war on Caribs made, Their strength divided was, and burnt their hold, And their unhappy heads beneath the still earth laid. XXXIII. Yet, spite of adverse fate, he in those climes Spain's infant power establish'd; after-times Have seen it flourish, and her sway maintain In either world, o'er many a fair domain. But wayward was his irksome lot the while, Striving with malice, mutiny, and guile; Yet vainly striving: that which most His generous bosom sought to shun, Each wise and lib'ral purpose cross'd, Must now at Mammon's ruthless call be done. Upon their native soil, They who were wont in harmless play To frolic out the passing day, Must pine with hateful toil. XXXIV. Yea; this he did against his better will; For who may stern ambition serve, and still His nobler nature trust? May on unshaken strength rely, Cast Fortune as she will her die, And say âI will be just?â XXXV. Envy mean, that in the dark Strikes surely at its noble mark, Against him rose with hatred fell, Which he could brave, but could not quell. Then he to Spain indignant went, And to his sov'reigns made complaint, With manly freedom, of their trust, Placed, to his cost, in men unjust, And turbulent. They graciously His plaint and plea received; and hoisting high His famed and gallant flag upon the main, He to his western world return'd again. Where he, the sea's unwearied, dauntless rover, Through many a gulph and strait, did first discover That continent, whose mighty reach From th' utmost frozen north doth stretch E'en to the frozen south; a land Of surface fair and structure grand. XXXVI. There, through vast regions rivers pour, Whose midway skiff scarce sees the shore; Which, rolling on in lordly pride, Give to the main their ample tide; And dauntless then, with current strong, Impetuous, roaring, bear along, And still their separate honours keep, In bold contention with the mighty deep. XXXVII. There broad-based mountains from the sight Conceal in clouds their vasty height, Whose frozen peaks, a vision rare, Above the girdling clouds rear'd far in upper air, At times appear, and soothly seem To the far distant, upcast eye, Like snowy watch-towers of the sky,â Like passing visions of a dream. XXXVIII. There forests grand of olden birth O'er-canopy the darken'd earth, Whose trees, growth of unreckon'd time, Rear o'er whole regions far and wide A checker'd dome of lofty pride, Silent, solemn, and sublime.â A pillar'd lab'rinth, in whose trackless gloom Unguided feet might stray till close of mortal doom. XXXIX. There grassy plains of verdant green Spread far beyond man's ken are seen, Whose darker bushy spots that lie Strew'd o'er the level vast, descry Admiring strangers, from the brow Of hill or upland steep, and show, Like a calm ocean's peaceful isles, When morning light through rising vapours smiles. XL. O'er this, his lastâhis proudest fame, He did assert his mission'd claim. Yet dark ambitious envy, more Incensed and violent than before, With crafty machinations gain'd His royal master's ear, who stain'd His princely faith, and gave it power To triumph, in a shameful hour. A mission'd gownsman o'er the sea Was sent his rights to supersede, And all his noble schemes impede,â His tyrant, spy, and judge to be. With parchment scrolls and deeds he came To kindle fierce and wasteful flame. Columbus' firm and dauntless soul Submitted not to base control. For who that hath high deeds achieved, Whose mind hath mighty plans conceived, Can of learn'd ignorance and pride The petty vexing rule abide? The lion trampled by an ass!â No; this all-school'd forbearance would surpass. Insulted with a felon's chain, This noble man must cross the main, And answer his foul charge to cold, ungrateful Spain. XLI. By India's gentle race alone Was pity to his suff'rings shown. They on his parting wait, And looks of kindness on him cast, Or touch'd his mantle as he pass'd, And mourn'd his alter'd state. âMay the Great Spirit smooth the tide âWith gentle gales, and be thy guide!â And when his vessel wore from land, With meaning nods and gestures kind, He saw them still upon the strand Tossing their dark arms on the wind. He saw them like a helpless flock Who soon must bear the cruel shock Of savage wolves, yet reckless still, Feel but the pain of present ill. He saw the fate he could not now control. And groan'd in bitter agony of soul. XLII. He trode the narrow deck with pain, And oft survey'd his rankling chain. The ship's brave captain grieved to see Base irons his noble pris'ner gall, And kindly sued to set him free; But proudly spoke the lofty thrall, âUntil the King whom I have served, âWho thinks this recompense deserved, âHimself command th' unclasping stroke, âThese gyved limbs will wear their yoke. âYea, when my head lies in the dust, âThese chains shall in my coffin rust. âBetter than lesson'd saw, though rude, âAs token, long preserved, of black ingratitude!â XLIII. Thus pent, his manly fortitude gave way To brooding passion's dark tumultuous sway. Dark was the gloom within, and darker grew Th' impending gloom without, as onward drew Th' embattled storm that, deep'ning on its way, With all its marshall'd host obscured the day. Volume o'er volume, roll'd the heavy clouds, And oft in dark dim masses, sinking slow, Hung in the nether air, like misty shrouds, Veiling the sombre, silent deep below; Like eddying snow-flakes from a lowering sky, Athwart the dismal gloom the frighten'd sea-fowl fly. Then from the solemn stillness round Utters the storm its awful sound. It groans upon the distant waves; O'er the mid-ocean wildly raves; Recedes afar with dying strain, That sadly through the troubled air Comes like the wailings of despair, And with redoubled strength returns again: Through shrouds and rigging, boards and mast, Whistles and howls, and roars th' outrageous blast. XLIV. From its vast bed profound with heaving throes The mighty waste of welt'ring waters rose. O'er countless waves, now mounting, now deprest, The ridgy surges swell with foaming crest, Like Alpine barriers of some distant shore, Now seen, now lost amidst the deaf'ning roar; While, higher still, on broad and sweepy base, Their growing bulk the mountain billows raise, Each far aloft in lordly grandeur rides, With many a vassal wave rough'ning his furrow'd sides, Heaved to its height, the dizzy skiff Shoots like an eagle from his cliff Down to the fearful gulf, and then On the swoln waters mounts again,â A fearful way! a fearful state For vessel charged with living freight! XLV. Within, without the tossing tempests rage This was, of all his earthly pilgrimage, The injured Hero's fellest, darkest hour. Yet swiftly pass'd its gloomy power; For as the wild winds louder blew, His troubled breast the calmer grew; And, long before the mighty hand, That rules the ocean and the land, Had calm'd the sea, with pious rev'rence fill'd, The warring passions of his soul were still'd. Through softly parting clouds the blue sky peer'd, And heavenward turn'd his eye with better feelings cheer'd. Meek are the wise, the great, the good;â He sigh'd, and thought of Him, who died on holy rood. XLVI. No more the angry tempest's sport, The vessel reach'd its destined port. A town of Christendom he greets. And treads again its well-known streets; A sight of wonder, grief, and shame To those who on his landing came, And on his state in silence gazed. âThis is the man whose dauntless soulââ So spoke their looksââSpain's power hath raised, âTo hold o'er worlds her proud controul! âHis honour'd brows with laurel crown'd, âHis hands with felon fetters bound!â XLVII. And he before his Sov'reign Dame And her stern Lord, indignant came; And bold in conscious honour, broke The silence of his smother'd flame, In words that all his inward anguish spoke. The gentle Queen's more noble breast Its generous sympathy express'd; And as his varied story show'd What wrongs from guileful malice flowed, Th' indignant eye and flushing cheek Did oft her mind's emotion speak. The sordid King, with brow severe, Could, all unmoved, his pleadings hear; Save that, in spite of royal pride, Which self-reproach can ill abide, His crimson'd face did meanly show Of conscious shame th' unworthy glow. Baffled, disgraced, his enemies remain'd, And base ambition for a time restrain'd. XLVIII. With four small vessels, small supply I trow! yet granted tardily, For such high service, he once more The western ocean to explore Directs his course. On many an isle He touch'd, where cheerly, for a while, His mariners their cares beguile Upon the busy shore. And there what wiles of barter keen Spaniard and native pass between; As feather'd crowns, whose colours change To every hue, with vizards strange, And gold and pearls are giv'n away, For bead, or bell, or bauble gay! Full oft the mutt'ring Indian eyes With conscious smile his wondrous prize, Beneath the shady plaintain seated, And thinks he hath the stranger cheated; Or foots the ground like vaunting child, Snapping his thumbs with anties wild. XLIX. But if, at length, tired of their guests, Consuming like those hateful pests, Locusts or ants, provisions stored For many days. they will afford No more, withholding fresh supplies, And strife and threat'ning clamours rise,â Columbus gentle craft pursues, And soon their noisy wrath subdues. Thus speaks the chief,ââRefuse us aid âFrom stores which heaven for all hath made! âThe moon, your mistress, will this night âFrom you withhold her blessed light, âHer ire to show; take ye the risk.â Then, as half-frighten'd, half in jest, They turn'd their faces to the east, From ocean rose her broaden'd disk; But when the deep eclipse came on, By science sure to him foreknown, How cower'd each savage at his feet, Like spaniel couching to his lord, Awed by the whip or angry word, His pardon to entreat! âTake all we have, thou heavenly man! âAnd let our mistress smile again!â L. Or, should the ship, above, below, Be fill'd with crowds, who will not go; Again, to spare more hurtful force, To harmless guile he has recourse. âHo! Gunner! let these scramblers know âThe power we do not use;â when, lo! From cannon's mouth the silv'ry cloud Breaks forth, soft curling on the air, Through which appears the lightning's glare, And bellowing roars the thunder loud. Quickly from bowsprit, shroud, or mast, Or vessel's side, the Indians cast Their naked forms, the water dashing O'er their dark heads, as stoutly lashing The briny waves with arms outspread, They gain the shore with terror's speed. LI. Thus checker'd still with shade and sheen Pass'd in the West his latter scene, As through the oak's toss'd branches pass Soft moon-beams, flickering on the grass; As on the lake's dark surface pour Broad flashing drops of summer-shower;â As the rude cavern's sparry sides When past the miner's taper glides. So roam'd the Chief, and many a sea Fathom'd and search'd unweariedly, Hoping a western way to gain To eastern climes,âan effort vain; For mighty thoughts, with error uncombined, Were never yet the meed of mortal mind. LII. At length, by wayward fortune cross'd, And oft-renew'd and irksome strife Of sordid men,âby tempests tost, And tired with turmoil of a wand'rer's life, He sail'd again for Europe's ancient shore, So will'd high heav'n! to cross the seas no more. His anchor fix'd, his sails for ever furl'd,â A toil-worn pilgrim in a weary world. LIII. And thus the Hero's sun went down, Closing his day of bright renown. Eight times through breeze and storm he pass'd O'er surge and wave th' Atlantic vast; And left on many an island fair Foundations, which the after-care Of meaner chieftains shortly rear'd To seats of power, served, envied, fear'd. No kingly conqueror, since time began The long career of ages, hath to man A scope so ample given for trade's bold range, Or caused on earth's wide stage such rapid mighty change. LIV. He, on the bed of sickness laid, Saw, unappall'd, death's closing shade! And there, in charity and love To man on earth and God above, Meekly to heaven his soul resign'd, His body to the earth consign'd. 'Twas in Valladolid he breathed his last, And to a better, heavenly city past; But St. Domingo, in her sacred fane. Doth his blest spot of rest and sculptured tomb contain. LV. There burghers, knights, adventurers brave Stood round in fun'ral weeds bedight; And bow'd them to the closing grave, And wish'd his soul good night. LVI. Now all the bold companions of his toil, Tenants of many a clime, who wont to come, (So fancy trows) when vex'd with worldly coil, And linger sadly by his narrow home;â Repentant enemies, and friends that grieve In self-upbraiding tenderness, and say, âCold was the love he did from us receive,ââ The fleeting restless spirits of a day, All to their dread account are pass'd away. LVII. Silence, solemn, awful, deep, Doth in that hall of death her empire keep; Save when at times the hollow pavement, smote By solitary wand'rer's foot, amain From lofty dome and arch and aisle remote A circling loud response receives again. The stranger starts to hear the growing sound, And sees the blazon'd trophies waving near;â âHa! tread my feet so near that sacred ground!â He stops and bows his head:ââColumbus resteth here!â LVIII. Some ardent youth, perhaps, ere from his home He launch his venturous bark, will hither come, Read fondly o'er and o'er his graven name With feelings keenly touch'd,âwith heart of flame; Till wrapp'd in fancy's wild delusive dream, Times past and long forgotten, present seem. To his charm'd ear, the east wind rising shrill Seems through the Hero's shroud to whistle still. The clock's deep pendulum swinging, through the blast, Sounds like the rocking of his lofty mast; While fitful gusts rave like his clam'rous band, Mix'd with the accents of his high command. Slowly the stripling quits the pensive scene, And burns, and sighs, and weeps to be what he has been. LIX. O! who shall lightly say that fame Is nothing but an empty name? Whilst in that sound there is a charm The nerves to brace, the heart to warm, As, thinking of the mighty dead, The young, from slothful couch will start, And vow, with lifted hands outspread, Like them to act a noble part! LX. O! who shall lightly say that fame Is nothing but an empty name? When, but for those, our mighty dead, All ages past, a blank would be, Sunk in oblivion's murky bed,â A desert bare, a shipless sea! They are the distant objects seen,â The lofty marks of what hath been. LXI. O! who shall lightly say that fame Is nothing but an empty name? When records of the mighty dead To earth-worn pilgrim's wistful eye The brightest rays of cheering shed, That point to immortality! LXII. A twinkling speck, but fix'd and bright, To guide us through the dreary night, Each hero shines, and lures the soul To gain the distant happy goal. For is there one who, musing o'er the grave Where lies interr'd the good, the wise, the brave, Can poorly think, beneath the mould'ring heap, That noble being shall for ever sleep? No; saith the gen'rous heart, and proudly swells,â âThough his cered corse lies here, with God his spirit dwells.â THE LEGEND OF LADY GRISELD BAILLIE. When sapient, dauntless, strong, heroic man! Our busy thoughts thy noble nature scan, Whose active mind, its hidden cell within, Frames that from which the mightiest works begin, Whose secret thoughts are light to ages lending, Whose potent arm is right and life defending, For helpless thousands, all on one high soul depending:â We pause, delighted with the fair survey, And haply in our wistful musings say, What mate, to match this noble work of heaven, Hath the all-wise and mighty Master given? One gifted like himself, whose head devises High things, whose soul at sound of battle rises, Who with glaved hand will through arm'd squadrons ride, And, death confronting, combat by his side; Will share with equal wisdom grave debate, And all the cares of chieftain, kingly state? Ay, such, I trow, in female form hath been Of olden times, and may again be seen, When cares of empire or strong impulse swell The generous breast, and to high deeds impel; For who can these as meaner times upbraid, Who think of Saragossa's valiant maid? But she of gentler nature, softer, dearer, Of daily life the active, kindly cheerer; With generous bosom, age or childhood shielding, And in the storms of life, though moved, unyielding; Strength in her gentleness, hope in her sorrow, Whose darkest hours some ray of brightness borrow From better days to come, whose meek devotion Calms every wayward passion's wild commotion; In want and suff'ring, soothing, useful, sprightly, Bearing the press of evil hap so lightly, Till evil's self seems its strong hold betraying To the sweet witch'ry of such winsome playing; Bold from affection, if by nature fearful, With varying brow, sad, tender, anxious, cheerful,â This is meet partner for the loftiest mind, With crown or helmet graced,âyea, this is womankind! Come ye, whose grateful memory retains Dear recollection of her tender pains, To whom your oft-conn'd lesson, daily said, With kiss and cheering praises was repaid; To gain whose smile, to shun whose mild rebuke, Your irksome task was learnt in silent nook, Though truant thoughts the while, your lot exchanging With freer elves, were wood and meadow ranging;â And ye, who best the faithful virtues know Of a link'd partner, tried in weal and woe, Like the slight willow, now aloft, now bending, But still unbroken, with the blast contending, Whose very look call'd virtuous vigour forth, Compelling you to match her noble worth;â And ye, who in a sister's modest praise Feel manly pride, and think of other days, Pleased that the playmate of your native home Hath in her prime an honour'd name become;â And ye, who in a duteous child have known A daughter, helpmate, sister, blent in one, From whose dear hand, which to no hireling leaves Its task of love, your age sweet aid receives, Who reckless marks youth's waning faded hue, And thinks her bloom well spent, when spent for you;â Come all, whose thoughts such dear remembrance bear, And to my short and faithful lay give ear! I. Within a prison's hateful cell, Where, from the lofty window fell, Through grated bars, the sloping beam, Defined, but faint, on couch of stone, There sat a pris'ner sad and lone, Like the dim tenant of a dismal dream. Deep in the shade, by low-arch'd door, With iron nails thick studded o'er, Whose threshold black is cross'd by those Who here their earthly being close, Or issue to the light again A scaffold with their blood to stain,â Moved something softly. Wistful ears Are quick of sense, and from his book The pris'ner raised his eyes with eager look,â âIs it a real form that through the gloom appears?â II. It was indeed of flesh and blood, The form that quickly by him stood; Of stature low, of figure light, In motion like some happy sprite; Yet meaning eyes and varying cheek, Now red, now pale, seem'd to bespeak Of riper years the cares and feeling Which with a gentle heart were dealing. âSuch sense in eyes so simply mild! âIs it a woman or a child? âWho art thou, damsel sweet? are not mine eyes beguiled?â III. âNo; from the Redbraes' tower I come; âMy father is Sir Patrick Hume; âAnd he has sent me for thy good, âHis dearly honour'd Jerviswood. âLong have I round these walls been straying, âAs if with other children playing; âLong near the gate have kept my watch âThe sentry's changing time to catch. âWith stealthy steps I gain'd the shade âBy the close-winding staircase made, âAnd when the surly turnkey enter'd, âBut little dreaming in his mind âWho follow'd him so close behind, âInto this darken'd cell, with beating heart, I ventur'd.â IV. Then from the simple vest that braced Her gentle breast, a letter traced With well-known characters, she took, And with an eager, joyful look, Her eyes up to his visage cast, His changing countenance to scan, As o'er the lines his keen glance past. She saw a faint glow tinge the sickly wan; She saw his eyes through tear-drops raise To heaven their look of silent praise, And hope's fresh touch undoing lines of care Which stress of evil times had deeply graven there. Meanwhile, the joy of sympathy to trace Upon her innocent and lovely face, Had to the sternest, darkest sceptic given Some love of human kind, some faith in righteous heaven. V. What blessings on her youthful head Were by the grateful patriot shed, (For such he was, good and devoted, And had at risk of life promoted His country's freedom and her faith, Nor reck'ning made of worldly scath) How warm, confiding, and sincere, He gave to her attentive ear The answer which her cautious sire Did to his secret note require;â How after this with queries kind, He ask'd for all she left behind In Redbraes' tower, her native dwelling, And set her artless tongue a-telling, Which urchin dear had tallest grown, And which the greatest learning shown, Of lesson, sermon, psalm, and note, And sabbath questions learnt by rote, And merry tricks and gambols play'd By ev'ning fire, and forfeits paid,â I will not here rehearse, nor will I say, How, on that bless'd and long-remember'd day, The pris'ner's son, deserving such a sire, First saw the tiny maid, and did admire, That one so young and wise and good and fair Should be an earthly thing that breathed this nether air. VI. E'en let my reader courteously suppose, That from this visit happier days arose; Suppose the pris'ner from his thraldom freed, And with our lay proceed. VII. The damsel, glad her mission'd task was done, Back to her home long since had blithely gone; And there remain'd, a meek and duteous child, Where useful toil, with play between, And pastime on the sunny green, The weeks and months of passing years beguil'd. VIII. Scotland the while convulsive lay Beneath a hateful tyrant's sway; For James's bigot mind th' ascendant gain'd, And fiercely raged blind ruthless power; While men, who true to conscience' voice remain'd, Were forced in caves and dens to cower: Bereft of home or hold or worldly wealth Upon the bleak and blasted heath, They sang their glorious Maker's praise by stealth, Th' inclement sky beneath. And some were forced to flee their native land, Or in the grated prison's gloom, Dealt to them by corruption's hateful hand, Abide their fatal doom. IX. And there our former thrall, the good, The firm, the gentle Jerviswood Again was pent, with sickness worn, Watching each pulse's feebler beat, Which promised, ere the fated morn, The scaffold of its prey to cheat. X. And now that patriot's ancient, faithful friend, Our maiden's sire, must to the tempest bend. He too must quit his social hearth, The place where cheerful friends resort, And trav'llers rest and children sport, To lay him on the mould'ring earth; Through days of lonely gloom to rest his head With them, who, in those times unblest, Alone had sure and fearless rest, The still, the envied dead. XI. Sad was his hiding-place, I ween, A fearful place, where sights had been, Full oft, by the benighted rustic seen; Ay, elrich forms in sheeted white, Which, in the waning moonlight blast, Pass by, nor shadow onward cast, Like any earthly wight: A place, where midnight lights had shone Through charnel windows, and the glancing Of wand'ring flame, on church-path lone, Betray'd the hour when fiends and hags were dancing, Or to their vigil foul with trooping haste advancing: A place, whose gate with weeds o'ergrown, Hemlock and dock of deep dull green, That climbing rank the lintels screen, What time the moon is riding high, The very hounds went cowering by, Or watch'd afar with howling moan; For brutes, 'tis said, will see what meets no human eye. XII. You well may guess his faithful wife A heart of heavy cheer had then, List'ning her household's hum of life, And thinking of his silent den. âOh! who will to that vault of death, âAt night's still watch repair, âThe dark and chilly sky beneath, âAnd needful succour bear? âMany his wants, who bideth lonely there!â XIII. Pleased had you been to have beheld, Like fire-sparks from the stricken stone, Like sun-beams on the rain-drop thrown, The kindling eye of sweet Griseld, When thus her mother spoke, for known Was his retreat to her alone. The wary dame to none beside The dangerous secret might confide. âO fear not, mother! I will go, âBetide me good or ill: âNor quick nor dead shall daunt me; no; âNor witch-fires, dancing in the dark, âNor owlet's shriek, nor watch-dog's bark, âFor I shall think, the while, I do God's blessed will. âI'll be his active Brownie sprite, âTo bring him needful food, and share his lonely night.â XIV. And she, ere stroke of midnight bell, Did bound her for that dismal cell; And took that haunted, fearful way, Which, till that hour, in twilight grey, She never by herself had past, Or e'en athwart its copse-wood cast A hasty glance, for dread of seeing The form of some unearthly being. But now, far other forms of fear To her scared sight appear, And, like a sudden fit of ague move her; The stump of some old, blasted tree, Or upright stone, or colt broke free To range at will the dewy lea, Seem lurking spy or rustic lover, Who may, e'en through the dark, her secret drift discover. XV. She pauses oft.ââWhat whispers near?â âThe babbling bourn sounds in mine ear. âSome hasty form the pathway crosses:â â'Tis but a branch the light wind tosses. âWhat thing is that by church-yard gate, âThat seems like spearman tall to wait? â'Tis but the martyr's slender stone âWhich stands so stately and alone: âWhy should I shrink? why should I fear? âThe vault's black door is near.â And she with icy fingers knock'd, And heard with joy the door unlock'd, And felt the yawning fence give way As deep and harsh the sounding hinges bray. XVI. But to describe their tender meeting, Tears shed unseen, affection utter'd In broken words, and blessings mutter'd, With many a kiss and kindly greeting, I know not; would my feeble skill Were meeter yoke-mate to my will! XVII. Then from the struck flint flew the spark, And lighted taper, faint and small, Gave out its dun-rays through the dark, On vaulted roof and crusted wall; On stones reversed in crumbling mould, And blacken'd poles of bier decay'd That lumb'ring on the ground were laid; On sculptured wrecks, defaced and old, And shreds of painted 'scutcheons torn, Which once, in pointed lozenge spread, The pillar'd church aloft had worn; While new-swept nook and lowly bed, Strange sight in such a place! Betray'd a piteous case,â Man from man's converse torn, the living with the dead. XVIII. The basket's store of viands and bread, Produced with looks of kind inviting, Her hands with busy kindness spread; And he her kindly care requiting, Fell to with thanks and relish keen, Nodded and quaff'd her health between, While she his glee return'd, her smiles with tears uniting. No lordling at his banquet rare E'er tasted such delicious fare; No beauty on her silken seat, With lover kneeling at her feet, E'er wept and smiled by turns with smiles so fondly sweet. XIX. But soon youth's buoyant gladsome nature Spreads joy unmix'd o'er every feature, As she her tale is archly telling Of feuds within their busy dwelling, While, round the sav'ry table sitting, She gleans his meal, the rest unwitting, How she, their open eyes deceiving, So dext'rous has become in thieving. She tells, how, of some trifle prating, She stirs them all to keen debating, While into napkin'd lap she's sliding Her portion, oft renew'd, and hiding, Beneath the board, her store; amazing Her jealous Frere, oft on her gazing. Then with his voice and eager eye, She speaks in harmless mimicry. âMother! was e'er the like beheld? âSome wolf possesses our Griseld; âShe clears her dish, as I'm a sinner! âLike ploughman at his new-year's dinner.â XX. And what each urchin, one by one, Had best in sport or lesson done, She fail'd not to repeat: Though sorry tales they might appear To a fastidious critic's ear, They were to him most sweet. XXI. But they must part till o'er the sky Night cast again her sable dye; For ah! her term is almost over! How fleetly hath it flown! As fleetly as with trysted lover The stealthy hour is gone. And could there be in lovers' meeting More powerful chords to move the mind, Fond heart to heart responsive beating, Than in that tender hour, pure, pious love entwined? XXII. Thus, night succeeding night, her love Did its unwearied nature prove, Tender and fearless; till, obscured by crimes, Again so darkly lower'd the changeful times, That her good sire, though shut from light of day, Might in that lowly den no longer stay. XXIII. From Edinburgh town a courier came, And round him flock'd the castle's dame, Children and servants, young and old. âWhat news? what news? thy visage sad âBetrays too plainly tidings bad.â And so it did; alas! sad was the tale he told. âFrom the oppressor's deadly hate âGood Jerviswood has met his fate âUpon the lofty scaffold, where âHe bore himself with dauntless air; âAlbeit, with mortal sickness spent, âUpon a woman's arm he leant. âFrom earth to heaven at yestere'en he went.â XXIV. In silence deep the list'ners stood, An instant horror chill'd their blood. The lady groan'd, and turn'd aside Her fears and troubled thoughts to hide. The children wept, then went to play; The servants cried âAh! well a day!â But oh! what inward sights, which borrow The forms that are not, changing still, Like shadows on a broken rill, Were blended with our damsel's sorrow! Those lips, those eyes so sweetly mild, That bless'd her as a humble child; The block in sable, deadly trim, The kneeling form, the headsman grim, The sever'd head with life-blood streaming,â Were ever 'thwart her fancy gleaming. Her father, too, in perilous state, He may be seiz'd, and like his friend Upon the fatal scaffold bend. May heaven preserve him still from such a dreadful end! And then she thought, if this must be, Who, honour'd sire, will wait on thee, And serve thy wants with decent pride, Like Baillie's kinswoman, subduing fear With fearless love, thy last sad scene to cheer, E'en on the scaffold standing by thy side? A friend like his, dear father, thou shalt have, To serve thee to the last, and linger round thy grave. XXV. Her father then, who narrowly With life escaped, was forced to fly His dangerous home, a home no more, And cross the sea. A friendly shore Received the fugitive, and there, Like prey brok'n from the spoiler's snare, To join her hapless lord, the dame Ere long with all her children came; And found asylum, where th' opprest Of Scotland's patriot sons had rest, Like sea-fowl clust'ring in the rock To shun some rising tempest's shock. XXVI. But said I all the children? no: Word incorrect! it was not so: For one, the youngest child, confin'd With fell disease, was left behind; While certain things, as thus by stealth They fled, regarding worldly wealth Of much import, were left undone; And who will now that peril run, Again to visit Scotland's shore, From whence they did in fear depart, And to each parent's yearning heart The darling child restore? XXVII. And who did for affection's sake This task of peril undertake? O! who but she, whose bosom swell'd With feelings high, whose self-devotion Follow'd each gen'rous, strong emotion, The young, the sweet, the good, the brave Griseld! XXVIII. Yes; she again cross'd o'er the main, And things of moment left undone, Though o'er her head had scarcely run Her nineteenth year, no whit deluded By wily fraud, she there concluded, And bore the youngling to its own again. XXIX. But when she reach'd the Belgian strand, Hard was her lot. Fast fell the rain, And there lay many miles of land, A stranger's land, ere she might gain The nearest town. With hardship cross'd, The wayward child its shoes had lost; Their coin was spent, their garments light, And dark and dreary was the night, Then like some gypsy girl on desert moor, Her helpless charge upon her back she bore. Who then had guess'd that figure slight, So bending in such humble plight, Was one of proud and gentle race; Possessing all that well became Th' accomplish'd maid or high-born dame, Befitting princely hall or monarch's court to grace? XXX. Their minds from many racking cares relieved, The gladsome parents to their arms received Her and the infant dear, caressing The twain by turns; while many a blessing, Which sweetly all her toil repaid, Was shed upon their gen'rous maid: And though the inmates of a humble home, To which they had as wretched outlaws come, Though hard their alter'd lot might be, In crowded city pent, They lived with mind and body free In grateful, quiet content. XXXI. And well, with ready hand and heart, Each task of toilsome duty taking, Did one dear inmate play her part, The last asleep, the earliest waking. Her hands each nightly couch prepared, And frugal meal on which they fared; Unfolding spread the servet white, And deck'd the board with tankard bright. Through fretted hose and garment rent, Her tiny needle deftly went, Till hateful penury, so graced, Was scarcely in their dwelling traced. With rev'rence to the old she clung, With sweet affection to the young. To her was crabbed lesson said, To her the sly petition made. To her was told each petty care: To her was lisp'd the tardy prayer, What time the urchin, half undrest And half asleep, was put to rest. XXXII. There is a sight all hearts beguiling,â A youthful mother to her infant smiling, Who, with spread arms and dancing feet, And cooing voice, returns its answer sweet. Who does not love to see the grandame mild, Lesson with yearning looks the list'ning child? But 'tis a thing of saintlier nature, Amidst her friends of pigmy stature, To see the maid in youth's fair bloom, A guardian sister's charge assume, And, like a touch of angel's bliss, Receive from each its grateful kiss;â To see them, when their hour of lore is past, Aside their grave demeanour cast. With her in mimic war they wrestle; Beneath her twisted robe they nestle; Upon her glowing cheek they revel, Low bended to their tiny level; While oft, her lovely neck bestriding, Crows some arch imp, like huntsman riding. This is a sight the coldest heart may feel; To make down rugged cheeks the kindly tear to steal. XXXIII. But when the toilsome sun was set, And ev'ning groups together met, (For other strangers shelter'd there Would seek with them to lighten care,) Her feet still in the dance moved lightest, Her eye with merry glance beam'd brightest, Her braided locks were coil'd the neatest, Her carol song was trill'd the sweetest; And round the fire, in winter cold, No archer tale than hers was told. XXXIV. O! spirits gay, and kindly heart! Precious the blessings ye impart! Though all unwittingly the while, Ye make the pining exile smile, And transient gladness charm his pain, Who ne'er shall see his home again. Ye make the stern misanthrope's brow With tint of passing kindness glow, And age spring from his elbow-chair The sport of lightsome glee to share. Thus did our joyous maid bestow Her beamy soul on want and woe; While proud, poor men, in threadbare suit, Frisk'd on the floor with lightsome foot, And from her magic circle chase The fiends that vex the human race. XXXV. And do not, gentle reader, chide, If I record her harmless pride, Who sacrificed the hours of sleep, Some show of better times to keep; That, though as humble soldier dight, A stripling brother might more trimly stand With pointed cuff and collar white, Like one of gentle race mix'd with a homelier band. And in that band of low degree Another youth of gentle blood Was found, who late had cross'd the sea, The son of virtuous Jerviswood, Who did as common sentry wait Before a foreign prince's gate. And if his eye oft on the watch, One look of sweet Griseld might catch, It was to him no dull nor irksome state. XXXVI. And thus some happy years stole by; Adversity with Virtue mated Her state of low obscurity Set forth but as deep shadows, fated By Heaven's high will to make the light Of future skies appear more bright. And thus, at lowest ebb, man's thoughts are oft elated. He deems not that the very struggle Of active virtue, in the war She bravely holds with present ill, Sustain'd by hope, does by the skill Of some conceal'd and happy juggle, Become itself the good which yet seems distant far. So, when their lamp of fortune burn'd With brightest ray, our worthies turn'd A recollection, fondly bent, On these, their happiest years, in humble dwelling spent. XXXVII. At length the sky, so long with clouds o'ercast, Unveil'd its cope of azure hue, And gave its fair expanse to view;â The pelting storm of tyranny was past. XXXVIII. For he, the Prince of glorious memory, The Prince, who shall, as passing ages fly, Be blest; whose wise, enlighten'd, manly mind, E'en when but with a stripling's years combined, Had with unyielding courage oft contended For Europe's freedom,âfor religion, blended With just, forbearing charity, and all To man most dear;ânow, at the honour'd call Of Britain's patriot sons, the ocean plough'd With gallant fleet, encompass'd by a crowd Of soldiers, statesmen, souls of proof, who vow'd Firm by his side to stand, let good or ill befall. And with those worthies, 'twas a happy doom, Right fairly earn'd, embark'd Sir Patrick Hume. Their fleet, though long at sea, and tempest-toss'd, In happy hour at last arrived on England's coast. XXXIX. Meantime his Dame and our fair Maid Still on the coast of Holland stay'd, With anxious and misgiving minds, List'ning the sound of warring winds: The ocean rose with deaf'ning roar, And beat upon the trembling shore, Whilst breakers dash'd their whit'ning spray O'er mound and dyke with angry bray, As if it would engulf again The land once rescued from its wild domain. XL. Oft on the beach our damsel stood 'Midst groups of many a fearful wight, Who view'd, like her, the billowy flood, Silent and sad, with visage shrunk and white, While bloated corse and splinter'd mast, And bale and cask on shore were cast,â A sad and rueful sight! But when, at the Almighty will, The tempest ceased, and sea was still, From Britain's isle glad tidings came, Received with loud and long acclaim. XLI. But joy appears with shrouded head To those who sorrow o'er the dead; For, struck with sore disease, while there They tarried pent in noisome air, The sister of her heart, whom she Had watch'd and tended lovingly, Like blighted branch whose blossoms fade, That day was in her coffin laid. She heard the chim'd bells loudly ringing, She heard the carol'd triumph singing, And clam'rous throng, and shouting boys, And thought how vain are human joys! XLII. Howbeit, her grief at length gives way To happier thoughts, as dawns the day When her kind parent and herself depart, In royal Mary's gentle train, To join, ere long, the dearest to her heart, In their own native land again. They soon their own fair island hail'd, As on the rippling sea they sail'd. Ye well may guess their joyful cry, With up-raised hands and glist'ning eye, When, rising from the ocean blue, Her chalky cliffs first met their view, Whose white verge on th' horizon rear'd, Like wall of noon-day clouds appear'd. XLIII. These ye may guess, for well the show And outward signs of joy we know. But cease we on this theme to dwell, For pen or pencil cannot tell The thrill of keen delight from which they flow. Such moments of ecstatic pleasure Are fancy's fairest, brightest treasure, Gilding the scope of duller days With oft-recurring retrospect, With which right happily she plays. E'en as a moving mirror will reflect Its glancing rays on shady side Of holme or glen, when school-boys guide With skilful hands their mimic sun To heaven's bright sun opposed; we see Its borrow'd sheen on fallow dun, On meadow green, on rock and tree, On broomy steep, on rippling spring, On cottage thatch, and every thing. XLIV. And Britain's virtuous Queen admired Our gentle Maid, and in her train Of ladies will'd her to remain; What more could young ambition have desired? But, like the blossom to the bough, Or wall-flower to the ruin's brow, Or tendril to the fost'ring stock, Or sea-weed to the briny rock, Or mistletoe to sacred tree, Or daisy to the swarded lea So truly to her own she clung;â Nor cared for honours vain, from courtly favour sprung. XLV. Nor would she in her native North, When woo'd by one of wealth and worth, The neighbour of her happy home, Though by her gentle parents press'd, And flatter'd, courted and caress'd, A splendid bride become. âI may not,â said her gentle heart, âThe very thought endure, âThat those so kind should feel the smart âA daughter's wants might oft impart, âFor Jerviswood is poor. âBut yet, though poor, why should I smother âThis dear regard? he'll be my brother, âAnd thus through life we'll love each other. âWhat though, as changing years flit by, âGrey grow my head, and dim his eye! âWe'll meekly bear our way ward fate, âAnd scorn their petty spite who rate, âWith senseless gibes, the single state, âTill we are join'd, at last, in heavenly bliss on high.â XLVI. But heaven for them decreed a happier lot: The father of the virtuous youth, Who died devoted for the truth, Was not, when better times return'd, forgot: To the right heir was given his father's land, And with his lady's love, he won her hand. XLVII. Their long-tried faith in honour plighted, They were a pair by heaven united, Whose wedded love, through lengthen'd years, The trace of early fondness wears. Her heart first guess'd his doubtful choice, Her ear first caught his distant voice, And from afar, her wistful eye Would first his graceful form descry. E'en when he hied him forth to meet The open air in lawn or street, She to her casement went, And after him, with smile so sweet, Her look of blessing sent. The heart's affection,âsecret thing! Is like the cleft rock's ceaseless spring, Which free and independent flows Of summer rains or winter snows. The fox-glove from its side may fall, The heath-bloom fade or moss-flower white, But still its streamlet, bright though small, Will issue sweetly to the light. XLVIII. How long an honour'd and a happy pair, They held their seemly state in mansion fair, I will not here in chiming verses say, To tire my reader with a lengthen'd lay; For tranquil bliss is as a summer day O'er broad Savannah shining; fair it lies, And rich the trackless scene, but soon our eyes, In search of meaner things, turn heavily away. XLIX. But no new ties of wedded life, That bind the mother and the wife, Her tender, filial heart could change, Or from its earliest friends estrange. The child, by strong affection led, Who braved her terror of the dead To save an outlaw'd parent, still In age was subject to his will. She then was seen with matron air, A dame of years, with count'nance fair, Though faded, sitting by his easy chair: A sight that might the heart's best feelings move! Behold her seated at her task of love! Books, papers, pencil, pen, and slate, And column'd scrolls of ancient date, Before her lie, on which she looks With searching glance, and gladly brooks An irksome task, that else might vex His temper, or his brain perplex; While, haply, on the matted floor, Close nestling at her kirtled feet, Its lap enrich'd with childish store, Sits, hush'd and still, a grandchild sweet, Who looks at times with eye intent, Full on its grandame's parent bent, Viewing his deeply furrow'd brow, And sunken lip and locks of snow, In serious wonderment. Well said that grateful sire, I ween! Still through life's many a varied scene, Griseld our dear and helpful child hath been. L. Though ever cheerfully possessing In its full zest the present blessing, Her grateful heart remembrance cherish'd Of all to former happiness allied, Nor in her fost'ring fancy perish'd E'en things inanimate that had supplied Means of enjoyment once. Maternal love, Active and warm, which nothing might restrain, Led her once more, in years advanced, to rove To distant southern climes, and once again Her footsteps press'd the Belgian shore, The town, the very street that was her home of yore. LI. Fondly that homely house she eyed, The door, the windows, every thing Which to her back-cast thoughts could bring The scenes of other days.âThen she applied To knocker bright her thrilling hand, And begg'd, as strangers in the land, Admittance from the household dame, And thus preferr'd her gentle claim: âThis house was once my happy home, âIts rooms, its stair, I fain would see; âIts meanest nook is dear to me, âLet me and mine within its threshold come.â But no; this might not be! Their feet might soil her polish'd floor, The dame held fast the hostile door, A Belgian housewife she. âFear not such harm! we'll doff our shoes: âDo not our earnest suit refuse! âWe'll give thee thanks, we'll give thee gold; âDo not kind courtesy withhold!â But still it might not be; The dull unpliant dame refused her gentle plea. LII. With her and her good lord, who still Sweet union held of mated will, Years pass'd away with lightsome speed; But ah! their bands of bliss at length were riven; And she was clothed in widow's sable weed, Submitting to the will of heaven. And then a prosp'rous race of children good And tender, round their noble mother stood. And she the while, cheer'd with their pious love, Waited her welcome summons from above. LIII. But whatsoe'er the weal or woe That heaven across her lot might throw, Full well her Christian spirit knew Its path of virtue, straight and true. When came the shock of evil times, menacing The peaceful landâwhen blood and lineage tracing As the sole claim to Britain's throne, in spite Of Britain's weal or will, chiefs of the North, In warlike muster, led their clansmen forth, Brave, faithful, strong and toughly nerved, Would they a better cause had served! For Stuart's dynasty to fight, Distress to many a family came, Who dreaded more th' approaching shame Of penury's ill-favour'd mien, Than e'en the pang of hunger keen. How softly then her pity flow'd! How freely then her hand bestow'd! She did not question their opinion Of party, kingship, or dominion: She would not e'en their folly chide, But like the sun and showers of heaven, Which to the false and true are given, Want and distress relieved on either side. LIV. But soon, from fear of future change, The evil took a wider range. The Northern farmers, spoil'd and bare, No more could rent or produce spare To the soil's lords. All were distress'd, And on our noble dame this evil sorely press'd. Her household numerous, her means withheld; Shall she her helpless servants now dismiss To rob or starve, in such a time as this, Or wrong to others do? But nothing quell'd Her calm and upright mind.ââGo, summon here Those who have served me many a year.â The summons went; each lowly name Full swiftly to her presence came, And thus she spoke: âYe've served me long, âPure, as I think, from fraud or wrong, âAnd now, my friendly neighbours, true âAnd simply I will deal with you. âThe times are shrewd, my treasures spent, âMy farms have ceased to yield me rent; âAnd it may chance that rent or grain âI never shall receive again. âThe dainties which my table fed âWill now be changed for daily bread, âDealt sparely, and for this I must âBe debtor to your patient trust, âIf ye consent.ââSwift through the hall, With eager haste, spoke one and all. âNo, noble dame! this must not be! âWith heart as warm and hand as free, âStill thee and thine we'll serve with pride, âAs when fair fortune graced your side. âThe best of all our stores afford âShall daily smoke upon thy board; âAnd shouldst thou never clear the score, âHeav'n for thy sake will bless our store.â She bent her head with courtesy, The big tear swelling in her eye, And thank'd them all. Yet plain and spare, She order'd still her household fare, Till fortune's better die we cast, And adverse times were past. LV. Good, tender, gen'rous, firm, and sage, Through grief and gladness, shade and sheen, As fortune changed life's motley scene, Thus pass'd she on to rev'rend age. And when the heavenly summons came, Her spirit from its mortal frame And weight of mortal cares to free, It was a blessed sight to see, The parting saint her state of honour keeping In gifted dauntless faith, whilst round her, weeping, Her children's children mourn'd on bended knee. LVI. In London's fair imperial town She laid her earthly burthen down. In Mellerstain, her northern home, Was raised for her a graven tomb Which gives to other days her modest, just renown. And now, ye polish'd fair of modern times, If such indeed will listen to my rhymes, What think ye of her simple, modest worth, Whom I have faintly tried to shadow forth? How vain the thought! as if ye stood in need Of pattern ladies in dull books to read. Will she such antiquated virtues prize, Who with superb Signoras proudly vies; Trilling before the dear admiring crowd, With out-stretch'd straining throat, bravuras loud, Her high heaved breast press'd hard, as if to boast The inward pain such mighty efforts cost? Or who on white-chalk'd floor, at midnight hour, Her head with many a flaunting full-blown flower And bartizan of braided locks enlarged, Her flimsy gown with twenty flounces charged, Wheels gaily round the room on pointed toe, Softly supported by some dandy beau:â Will she, forsooth! or any belle of spirit, Regard such old, forgotten, homely merit? Or she, whose cultured, high-strain'd talents soar Through all th' ambitious range of letter'd lore With soul enthusiastic, fondly smitten With all that e'er in classic page was written, And whilst her wit in critic task engages, The echoed praise of all praised things outrages; Whose finger, white and small, with ink-stain tipt, Still scorns with vulgar thimble to be clipt; Who doth with proud pretence her claims advance To philosophic, honour'd ignorance Of all, that, in divided occupation, Gives the base stamp of female degradation; Protests she knows not colour, stripe, nor shade, Nor of what stuff her flowing robe is made, But wears, from petty, frivolous fancies free, Whatever careful Betty may decree; As certes, well she may, for Betty's skill Leaves her in purfle, furbelow, or frill, No whit behind the very costliest fair That wooes with daily pains the public stare; Who seems almost ashamed to be a woman, And yet the palm of parts will yield to no man, But holds on battle-ground eternal wrangling, The plainest case in mazy words entangling:â Will she, I trow, or any kirtled sage, Admire the subject of my artless page? And yet there be of British fair, I know, Who to this legend will some favour show From kindred sympathy; whose life proceeds In one unwearied course of gentle deeds, Who pass untainted through the earthly throng, Like souls that to some better world belong. Nor will I think, as sullen cynics do, Still libelling present times, their number few. Yea, leagued for good they act, a virtuous band, The young, the rich, the loveliest of the land, Who clothe the naked, and each passing week, The wretched poor in their sad dwellings seek, Who, cheer'd and grateful, feebly press and bless The hands which princes might be proud to kissâ Such will regard my tale, and give to fame A generous helpful Maid,âa good and noble Dame. LORD JOHN OF THE EAST: A BALLAD. The fires blazed bright till deep midnight, And the guests sat in the hall, And the lord of the feast, Lord John of the East, Was the merriest of them all. His dark-grey eye, that wont so sly Beneath his helm to scowl, Flash'd keenly bright, like a new-waked sprite, As pass'd the circling bowl. In laughter light, or jocund lay, That voice was heard, whose sound, Stern, loud, and deep, in battle-fray Did foe-men fierce astound; And stretch'd, as balm, like lady's palm, To every jester near, That hand which through a prostrate foe Oft thrust the ruthless spear. The gallants sang, and the goblets rang, And they revell'd in careless state, Till a thund'ring sound, that shook the ground, Was heard at the castle gate. âWho knocks without, so loud and stout? âSome wand'ring knight, I ween, âWho from afar, like a guiding star, âOur blazing hall hath seen. âIf a stranger it be of high degree, â(No churl durst make such din,) âStep forth amain, my pages twain, âAnd soothly ask him in. âTell him our cheer is the forest deer, âOur bowl is mantling high, âAnd the lord of the feast is John of the East, âWho welcomes him courteously.â The pages twain return'd again, And a wild, scared look had they; âWhy look ye so?âis it friend or foe?â Did the angry baron say. âA stately knight without doth wait, âBut further he will not hie, âTill the baron himself shall come to the gate, âAnd ask him courteously.ââ âBy my mother's shroud, he is full proud! âWhat earthly man is he?â âI know not, in truth,â quoth the trembling youth, âIf earthly-man it be. âIn reveller's plight, he is bedight, âWith a vest of cramoisie meet; âBut his mantle behind, that streams on the wind, âIs a corse's bloody sheet.â âOut, paltry child! thy wits are wild, âThy comrade will tell me true: âSay plainly, then, what hast thou seen? âOr dearly shalt thou rue.â Faint spoke the second page with fear, And bent him on his knee, âWere I on your father's sword to swear, âThe same it appear'd to me.â Then dark, dark lower'd the baron's eye, And his red cheek changed to wan; For again at the gate more furiously, The thund'ring din began. âAnd is there ne'er of my vassals here, âOf high or low degree, âThat will unto this stranger go,â âWill go for the love of me?â Then spoke and said, fierce Donald the Red,â (A fearless man was he,) âYes; I will straight to the castle gate, âLord John, for the love of thee.â With heart full stout, he hied him out, Whilst silent all remain: Nor moved a tongue those gallants among, Till Donald return'd again. âO speak,â said his lord, âby thy hopes of grace, âWhat stranger must we hail?â But the haggard look of Donald's face Made his falt'ring words to fail. âIt is a knight in some foreign guise, âHis like did I never behold; âFor the stony look of his beamless eyes âMade my very life-blood cold. âI did him greet in fashion meet, âAnd bade him your feast partake, âBut the voice that spoke, when he silence broke, âMade the earth beneath me quake. âO such a tone did tongue ne'er own âThat dwelt in mortal head;â âIt is like a sound from the hollow ground,â âLike the voice of the coffin'd dead. âI bade him to your social board, âBut in he will not hie, âUntil at the gate this castle's lord âShall entreat him courteously. âAnd he stretch'd him the while with a ghastly smile, âAnd sternly bade me say, â'Twas no depute's task your guest to ask âTo the feast of the woody bay.â Pale grew the baron, and faintly said, As he heaved his breath with pain, âFrom such a feast as there was spread, âDo any return again? âI bade my guest to a bloody feast, âWhere the death's wound was his fare, âAnd the isle's bright maid, who my love betray'd, âShe tore her raven hair. âThe sea-fowl screams, and the watch-tower gleams, âAnd the deaf'ning billows roar, âWhere he unblest was put to rest, âOn a wild and distant shore. âDo the hollow grave and the whelming wave âGive up their dead again? âDoth the surgy waste waft o'er its breast âThe spirits of the slain?â But his loosen'd limbs shook fast, and pour'd The big drops from his brow, As louder still the third time roar'd The thund'ring gate below. âO rouse thee, baron, for manhood's worth! âLet good or ill befall, âThou must to the stranger knight go forth, âAnd ask him to your hall.â âRouse thy bold breast,â said each eager guest, âWhat boots it shrinking so? âBe it fiend or sprite, or murder'd knight, âIn heaven's name thou must go. âWhy shouldst thou fear? dost thou not wear âA gift from the great Glendower, âSandals blest by a holy priest, âO'er which nought ill hath power?â All ghastly pale did the baron quail, As he turn'd him to the door, And his sandals blest by a holy priest Sound feebly on the floor. Then back to the hall and his merry mates all, He cast his parting eye. âGod send thee amain, safe back again!â He heaved a heavy sigh. Then listen'd they, on the lengthen'd way, To his faint and less'ning tread, And, when that was past, to the wailing blast, That wail'd as for the dead. But wilder it grew, and stronger it blew, And it rose with an elrich sound, Till the lofty keep on its rocky steep, Fell hurtling to the ground. Each fearful eye then glanced on high, To the lofty-window'd wall, When a fiery trace of the baron's face Through the casements shone on all. But the vision'd glare pass'd through the air, And the raging tempest ceased, And never more, on sea or shore, Was seen Lord John of the East. The sandals, blest by a holy priest, Lay unscathed on the swarded green, But never again, on land or main, Lord John of the East was seen. MALCOLM'S HEIR: A TALE OF WONDER. O go not by Duntorloch's Walls When the moon is in the wane, And cross not o'er Duntorloch's Bridge, The farther bank to gain. For there the Lady of the Stream In dripping robes you'll spy, A-singing to her pale wan babe, An elrich lullaby. And stop not at the house of Merne, On the eve of good Saint John, For then the Swathed Knight walks his rounds With many a heavy moan. All swathed is he in coffin weeds, And a wound is in his breast, And he points still to the gloomy vault, Where they say his corse doth rest. But pass not near Glencromar's Tower, Though the sun shine e'er so bright; More dreaded is this in the noon of day, Than those in the noon of night. The night-shade rank grows in the court, And snakes coil in the wall, And bats lodge in the rifted spire, And owls in the murky hall. On it there shines no cheerful light, But the deep-red setting sun Gleams bloody red on its battlements When day's fair course is run. And fearfully in night's pale beams, When the moon peers o'er the wood, Its shadow grim stretch'd o'er the ground Lies blackening many a rood. No sweet bird's chirping there is heard, No herd-boy's horn doth blow; But the owlet hoots and the pent blast sobs, And loud croaks the carrion-crow. No marvel! for within its walls Was done the deed unblest, And in its noisome vaults the bones Of a father's murderer rest. He laid his father in the tomb With deep and solemn woe, As rumour tells, but righteous heaven Would not be mocked so. There rest his bones in the mouldering earth, By lord and by carle forgot; But the foul, fell spirit that in them dwelt, Rest hath it none, I wot! âAnother night,â quoth Malcolm's heir, As he turn'd him fiercely round, And closely clench'd his ireful hand, And stamp'd upon the ground: âAnother night within your walls âI will not lay my head, âThough the clouds of heaven my roof should be, âAnd the cold dank earth my bed. âYour younger son has now your love, âAnd my stepdame false your ear; âAnd his are your hawks and his are your hounds, âAnd his your dark-brown deer. âTo him you have given your noble steed, âAs fleet as the passing wind; âBut me have you shamed before my friends, âLike the son of a base-born hind:â Then answer'd him the white-hair'd chief, Dim was his tearful eye, âProud son, thy anger is all too keen, âThy spirit is all too high. âYet rest this night beneath my roof, âThe wind blows cold and shrill, âWith to-morrow's dawn, if so it must be, âE'en follow thy wayward will.â Yet nothing moved was Malcolm's heir, And never a word did he say, But cursed his father in his heart, And sternly strode away. And his coal-black steed he mounted straight, As twilight gather'd round, And at his feet with eager speed Ran Swain, his faithful hound. Loud rose the blast, yet ne'ertheless With furious speed rode he, Till night, like the gloom of a cavern'd mine, Had closed o'er tower and tree. Loud rose the blast, thick fell the rain, Keen flash'd the light'ning red, And loud the awful thunder roar'd O'er his unshelter'd head. At length full close before him shot A flash of sheeted light, And the high-arch'd gate of Glencromar's tower, Glared on his dazzled sight. His steed stood still, nor step would move, Up look'd his wistful Swain, And wagg'd his tail, and feebly whined; He lighted down amain. Through porch and court he pass'd, and still His list'ning ear he bow'd, Till beneath the hoofs of his trampling steed The paved hall echo'd loud. And other echoes answer gave From arches far and grand; Close to his horse and his faithful dog He took his fearful stand. The night-birds shriek'd from the creviced roof, And the fitful blast sang shrill, Yet ere the mid-watch of the night, Were all things hush'd and still. But in the mid-watch of the night, When hush'd was every sound, Faint, doleful music struck his ear, As if waked from the hollow ground. And loud and louder still it grew, And upward still it wore, Till it seem'd at the end of the farthest aisle To enter the eastern door. O! never did music of mortal make Such dismal sounds contain; A horrid elrich dirge it seem'dâ A wild unearthly strain. The yell of pain, and the wail of woe, And the short shrill shriek of fear, Through the winnowing sound of a furnace flame, Confusedly struck his ear. And the serpent's hiss, and the tiger's growl, And the famish'd vulture's cry, Were mix'd at times, as with measured skill, In this horrid harmony. Up bristled the locks of Malcolm's heir, And his heart it quickly beat, And his trembling steed shook under his hand, And Swain cower'd close to his feet. When lo! a faint light through the porch Still strong and stronger grew, And shed o'er the walls and the lofty roof Its wan and dismal hue. And slowly ent'ring then appear'd, Approaching with soundless tread, A funeral band in dark array, As in honour of the dead. The first that walk'd were torchmen ten, To lighten their gloomy road, And each wore the face of an angry fiend, And on cloven goats' feet trode. And the next that walk'd as mourners meet, Were murderers twain and twain, With bloody hands and surtout red, Befoul'd with many a stain. Each with a cut-cord round his neck, And red-strain'd, starting een, Show'd that upon the gibbet tree, His earthly end had been. And after these, in solemn state, There came an open bier, Borne on black, shapeless rampant forms, That did but half appear. And on that bier a corse was laid, As corse could never lie, That did by decent hands composed In nature's struggles die. Nor stretch'd, nor swathed, but every limb In strong distortion lay, As in the throes of a violent death Is fix'd the lifeless clay. And in its breast was a broken knife, With the black blood bolter'd round; And its face was the face of an aged man, With the filleted locks unbound. Its features were fix'd in horrid strength, And the glaze of its half-closed eye, A last dread parting look express'd, Of woe and agony. But, oh! the horrid form to trace, That follow'd it close behind, In fashion of the chief-mourner, What words shall minstrel find? In his lifted hand, with straining grasp, A broken knife he press'd, The other half of the cursed blade Was that in the corse's breast. And in his blasted, horrid face, Full strongly mark'd, I ween, The features of the aged corse In life's full prime were seen. Ay, gnash thy teeth and tear thy hair, And roll thine eye-balls wild, Thou horrible accursed son, With a father's blood defiled! Back from the bier with strong recoil, Still onward as they go, Doth he in vain his harrow'd head, And writhing body throw. For, closing round, a band of fiends Full fiercely with him deal, And force him o'er the bier to bend, With their fangs of red-hot steel. Still on they moved, and stopp'd at length, In the midst of the trembling hall, When the dismal dirge, from its loudest pitch, Sank to a dying fall. But what of horror next ensued, No mortal tongue can tell, For the thrill'd life paused in Malcolm's heir, In a death-like trance he fell. The morning rose with cheerful light, On the country far and near, But neither in country, tower, nor town, Could they find Sir Malcolm's heir. They sought him east, they sought him west, O'er hill and vale they ran, And met him at last on the blasted heath, A crazed and wretched man. He will to no one utter his tale, But the priest of St. Cuthbert's cell, And aye, when the midnight warning sounds, He hastens his beads to tell. THE ELDEN TREE: AN ANCIENT BALLAD. A feast was spread in the baron's hall, And loud was the merry sound, As minstrels played at lady's call, And the cup went sparkling round. For gentle dames sat there, I trow, By men of mickle might, And many a chief with dark red-brow, And many a burly knight. Each had fought in war's grim ranks, And some on the surgy sea, And some on Jordan's sacred banks, For the cause of Christentie. But who thinks now of blood or strife, Or Moorish or Paynim foe? Their eyes beam bright with social life, And their hearts with kindness glow. âGramercie Chieftain, on thy tale! âIt smacks of thy merry mood.ââ âAy, monks are sly, and women frail, âSince rock and mountain stood.â âFy, fy! sir knight, thy tongue is keen, â'Tis sharper than thy steel.ââ âSo, gentle lady, are thine eyen, âAs we poor lovers feel.â âCome, pledge me well, my lady gay, âCome, pledge me, noble frere; âEach cheerful mate on such a day, âIs friend or mistress dear.â And louder still comes jeer and boast, As the flagons faster pour, Till song, and tale, and laugh are lost, In a wildly mingled roar. Ay, certes, 'tis an hour of glee, For the baron himself doth smile, And nods his head right cheerily, And quaffs his cup the while. What recks he now of midnight fear, Or the night wind's dismal moan? As it tosses the boughs of that Elden Tree, Which he thinketh so oft upon? Long years have past since a deed was done, By its doer only seen, And there lives not a man beneath the sun, Who wotteth that deed hath been. So gay was he, so gay were all, They mark'd not the growing gloom; Nor wist they how the dark'ning hall, Lower'd like the close of doom. Dull grew the goblet's sheen, and grim The features of every guest, And colourless banners aloft hung dim, Like the clouds of the drizzly west. Hath time pass'd then so swift of pace? Is this the twilight grey? A flash of light pass'd through the place, Like the glaring noon of day. Fierce glanced the momentary blaze O'er all the gallant train, And each visage pale, with dazzled gaze, Was seen and lost again. And the thunder's rolling peal, from far, Then on and onward drew, And varied its sound like the broil of war, And loud and louder grew. Still glares the lightning blue and pale, And roars th' astounding din; And rattle the windows with bickering hail, And the rafters ring within. And cowering hounds the board beneath Are howling with piteous moan, While lords and dames sit still as death, And words are utter'd none. At length in the waning tempest's fall, As light from the welkin broke, A frighten'd man rush'd through the hall, And words to the baron spoke. âThe thunder hath stricken your tree so fair, âIts roots on green-sward lie,ââ âWhat tree?âââThe Elden planted there âSome thirty years gone by.â âAnd wherefore starest thou on me so, âWith a face so ghastly wild?ââ âWhite bones are found in the mould below, âLike the bones of a stripling child.â Pale he became as the shrouded dead, And his eye-balls fix'd as stone; And down on his bosom dropp'd his head, And he utter'd a stifled groan. Then from the board, each guest amazed, Sprang up, and curiously Upon his sudden misery gazed, And wonder'd what might be. Out spoke the ancient seneschal, âI pray you stand apart, âBoth gentle dames and nobles all, âThis grief is at his heart. âGo, call St. Cuthbert's monk with speed, âAnd let him be quickly shriven, âAnd fetch ye a leech for his body's need, âTo dight him for earth or heaven.â âNo, fetch me a priest,â the baron said, In a voice that seem'd utter'd with pain; And he shudder'd and shrank as he faintly bade His noble guests remain. âHeaven's eye each secret deed doth scan, âHeaven's justice all should fear: âWhat I confess to the holy man, âBoth heaven and you shall hear.â And soon St. Cuthbert's monk stood by With visage sad, but sweet, And cast on the baron a piteous eye, And the baron knelt low at his feet. âO Father! I have done a deed âWhich God alone did know; âA brother's blood these hands have shed, âWith many a fiend-like blow: âFor fiends lent strength like a powerful charm, âAnd my youthful breast impell'd, âAnd I laugh'd to see beneath my arm âThe sickly stripling quell'd. âA mattock from its pit I took, âDug deep for the Elden Tree, âAnd I tempted the youth therein to look âSome curious sight to see. âThe woodmen to their meal were gone, âAnd ere they return'd again, âI had planted that tree with my strength alone, âO'er the body of the slain. âAh! gladly smiled my father then, âAnd seldom he smiled on me, âWhen he heard that my skill, like the skill of men, âHad planted the Elden Tree. âBut where was his eldest son so dear, âWho nearest his heart had been? âThey sought him far, they sought him near, âBut the boy no more was seen. âAnd thus his life and lands he lost, âAnd his father's love beside; âThe thought that ever rankled most âIn this heart of secret pride. âAh! could the partial parent wot âThe cruel pang he gives, âTo the child neglected and forgot, âWho under his cold eye lives! âHis elder rights did my envy move, âThese lands and their princely hall; âBut it was our father's partial love, âI envied him most of all. âNow thirty years have o'er me past, âAnd, to the eye of man, âMy lot was with the happy cast, âMy heart it could not scan. âOh! I have heard in the dead of night, âMy murther'd brother's groan, âAnd shudder'd, as the pale moon-light âOn the mangled body shone. âMy very miners pent in gloom, âWhose toil my coffers stored, âWho cursed belike their cheerless doom, âWere happier than their lord. âO holy man! my tale is told âWith pain, with tears, with shame; âMay penance hard, may alms of gold, âSome ghostly favour claim? âThe knotted scourge shall drink my blood, âThe earth my bed shall be, âAnd bitter tears my daily food, âTo earn heaven's grace for me.â Now, where that rueful deed was done Endow'd with rights and lands, Its sharp spires bright'ning in the sun, A stately abbey stands. And the meekest monk, whose life is there Still spent on bended knee, Is he who built that abbey fair, And planted the Elden Tree. THE GHOST OF FADON. On Gask's deserted ancient hall Was twilight closing fast, And, in its dismal shadows, all Seem'd lofty, void, and vast. All sounds of life, now reft and bare, From its walls had pass'd away, But the stir of small birds shelter'd there, Dull owl, or clatt'ring jay. Loop-hole and window, dimly seen, With faint light passing through, Grew dimmer still, and the dreary scene Was fading from the view; When the trampling sound of banded men Came from the court without; Words of debate and call, and then A loud and angry shout. But mingled echoes from within A mimic mock'ry made, And the bursting door with furious din, On jarring hinges bray'd. An eager band, press'd rear on van, Rush'd in with clam'rous sound, And their chief, the goodliest, bravest man, That e'er trode Scottish ground. Then spoke forthwith that leader bold, âWe war with wayward fate; âThese walls are bare, the hearth is cold, âAnd all is desolate. âWith fast unbroken and thirst unslaked âMust we on the hard ground sleep? âOr, like ghosts from vaulted charnel waked âOur cheerless vigil keep? âHard hap this day in bloody field, âYe bravely have sustain'd, âAnd for your pains this dismal bield, âAnd empty board have gain'd. âHie, Malcolm, to that varlet's steed, âAnd search if yet remain âSome homely store, but good at need, âSpent nature to sustain. âCheer up, my friends! still, heart in hand, âThough few and spent we be, âWe are the pith of our native land, âAnd she shall still be free. âCheer up! though scant and coarse our meal, âIn this our sad retreat, âWe'll fill our horn to Scotland's weal, âAnd that will make it sweet.â Then all, full cheerly, as they could, Their willing service lent, Some broke the boughs, some heap'd the wood, Some struck the sparkling flint. And a fire they kindled speedily, Where the hall's last fire had been, And pavement, walls, and rafters high, In the rising blaze were seen. Red gleam on each tall buttress pour'd, The lengthen'd hall along, And tall and black behind them lower'd, Their shadows deep and strong. The ceiling, ribb'd with massy oak, From bick'ring flames below, As light and shadow o'er it broke, Seem'd wav'ring to and fro. Their scanty meal was on the ground, Spread by the friendly light, And they made the brown-horn circle round, As cheerly as they might. Some talk of horses, weapons, mail, Some of their late defeat, By treach'ry caused, and many a tale Of Southron spy's retreat. âAy, well,â says one, âmy sinking heart âDid some disaster bode, âWhen faithless Fadon's wily art âBeguiled us from the road. âBut well repaid by Providence âAre such false deeds we see; âHe's had his rightful recompence, âAnd cursed let him be.â âOh! curse him not! I needs must rue âThat stroke so rashly given: âIf he to us were false or true, âIs known to righteous heaven.â So spoke their chief, then silent all Remain'd in sombre mood, Till they heard a bugle's larum call Sound distant through the wood. âRouse ye, my friends!â the chieftain said, âThat blast, from friend or foe, âComes from the west; through forest shade âWith wary caution go. âAnd bring me tidings. Speed ye well!â Forth three bold warriors pass'd: Then from the east with fuller swell Was heard the bugle blast. Out pass'd three warriors more: then shrill The horn blew from the north, And other eager warriors still, As banded scouts, went forth. Till from their chief each war-mate good Had to the forest gone, And he, who feared not flesh and blood, Stood by the fire alone. He stood, wrapp'd in a musing dream, Nor raised his drooping head, Till a sudden, alter'd, paly gleam On all around was spread. Such dull, diminish'd, sombre sheen From moon eclipsed, by swain Belated, or lone herd is seen, O'er-mantling hill and plain. Then to the fitful fire he turn'd, Which higher and brighter grew, Till the flame like a baleful meteor burn'd, Of clear sulphureous blue. Then wist the chief, some soul unblest, Or spirit of power was near; And his eyes adown the hall he cast, Yet nought did there appear. But he felt a strange unearthly breath Upon the chill air borne, And he heard at the gate, like a blast of wrath, The sound of Fadon's horn. Owls, bats, and swallows, flutt'ring, out From hole and crevice flew, Circling the lofty roof about, As loud and long it blew. His noble hound sprang from his lair, The midnight rouse to greet, Then, like a timid trembling hare, Crouch'd at his master's feet. Between his legs his drooping tail, Like dog of vulgar race, He hid, and with strange piteous wail, Look'd in his master's face. The porch seem'd void, but vapour dim Soon fill'd the lowering room, Then was he aware of a figure grim Approaching through the gloom. And striding as it onward came, The vapour wore away, Till it stood distinctly by the flame, Like a form in the noon of day. Well Wallace knew that form, that head, That throat unbraced and bare, Mark'd deep with streaming circlet red, And he utter'd a rapid prayer. But when the spectre raised its arm, And brandish'd its glitt'ring blade, That moment broke fear's chilly charm On noble Wallace laid. The threaten'd combat was to him Relief; with weapon bare, He rush'd upon the warrior grim, But his sword shore empty air Then the spectre smiled with a ghastly grin, And its warrior-semblance fled, And its features grew stony, fix'd, and thin, Like the face of the stiffen'd dead. The head a further moment crown'd The body's stately wreck, Shook hideously, and to the ground Dropp'd from the bolter'd neck. Back shrank the noble chief aghast, And longer tarried not, Then quickly to the portal pass'd, To shun the horrid spot. But in the portal, stiff and tall, The apparition stood, And Wallace turn'd and cross'd the hall, Where entrance to the wood By other door he hoped to snatch, Whose pent arch darkly lower'd, But there, like sentry on his watch, The dreadful phantom tower'd. Then up the ruin'd stairs so steep, He ran with panting breath, And from a windowâdesp'rate leap! Sprang to the court beneath. O'er wall and ditch he quickly got, Through brake and bushy stream, When suddenly through darkness shot A red and lurid gleam. He look'd behind, and that lurid light Forth from the castle came; Within its circuit through the night Appear'd an elrich flame. Red glow'd each window, slit, and door, Like mouths of furnace hot, And tint of deepest blackness wore The walls and steepy moat. But soon it rose with bright'ning power, Till bush and ivy green, And wall-flower, fringing breach and tower, Distinctly might be seen. A spreading blaze, with eddying sweep, Its spiral surges rear'd; Aloft then on the stately keep, Lo! Fadon's Ghost appear'd. A burning rafter, blazing bright, It wielded in its hand; And its warrior-form of human height, Dilated grew, and grand. Coped by a curling tawny cloud, With tints sulphureous blent, It rose with burst of thunder loud, And up the welkin went. High, high it rose with wid'ning glare, Sent far o'er land and main, And shot into the lofty air, And all was dark again. A spell of horror lapp'd him round, Chill'd, motionless, amazed, His very pulse of life was bound As on black night he gazed. Till harness'd warriors' heavy tread, From echoing dell arose; âThank God!â with utter'd voice, he said, âFor here come living foes.â With kindling soul that brand he drew Which boldest Southron fears, But soon the friendly call he knew, Of his gallant brave compeers. With haste each wondrous tale was told, How still, in vain pursuit, They follow'd the horn through wood and wold, And Wallace alone was mute. Day rose; but silent, sad, and pale, Stood the bravest of Scottish race; And each warrior's heart began to quail, When he look'd in his leader's face. FUGITIVE VERSES. TO SAMUEL ROGERS, ESQ., THIS BOOK IS GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR. A WINTER'S DAY. The cock, warm roosting 'mid his feather'd mates, Now lifts his beak and snuffs the morning air, Stretches his neck and claps his heavy wings, Gives three hoarse crows, and glad his task is done, Low chuckling turns himself upon the roost, Then nestles down again into his place. The labouring hind, who, on his bed of straw Beneath his home-made coverings, coarse but warm, Lock'd in the kindly arms of her who spun them, Dreams of the gain that next year's crop should bring; Or at some fair, disposing of his wool, Or by some lucky and unlook'd-for bargain, Fills his skin purse with store of tempting gold; Now wakes from sleep at the unwelcome call, And finds himself but just the same poor man As when he went to rest. He hears the blast against his window beat, And wishes to himself he were a laird, That he might lie a-bed. It may not be: He rubs his eyes and stretches out his arms; Heigh oh! heigh oh! he drawls with gaping mouth, Then, most unwillingly creeps from his lair, And without looking-glass puts on his clothes. With rueful face he blows the smother'd fire, And lights his candle at the reddening coal; First sees that all be right among his cattle, Then hies him to the barn with heavy tread, Printing his footsteps on the new-fall'n snow. From out the heap'd-up now he draws his sheaves, Dislodging the poor red-breast from his shelter Where all the live-long night he slept secure; But now, affrighted, with uncertain flight, Flutters round walls, and roof, to find some hole Through which he may escape. Then whirling o'er his head, the heavy flail Descends with force upon the jumping sheaves, While every rugged wall and neighbouring cot The noise re-echoes of his sturdy strokes. The family cares call next upon the wife To quit her mean but comfortable bed. And first she stirs the fire and fans the flame, Then from her heap of sticks for winter stored An armful brings; loud crackling as they burn, Thick fly the red sparks upward to the roof, While slowly mounts the smoke in wreathy clouds. On goes the seething pot with morning cheer, For which some little wistful folk await, Who, peeping from the bed-clothes, spy well pleased The cheery light that blazes on the wall, And bawl for leave to rise. Their busy mother knows not where to turn, Her morning's work comes now so thick upon her. One she must help to tie his little coat, Unpin another's cap, or seek his shoe Or hosen lost, confusion soon o'er-master'd! When all is o'er, out to the door they run With new-comb'd sleeky hair and glistening faces, Each with some little project in his head. His new-soled shoes one on the ice must try; To view his well-set trap another hies, In hopes to find some poor unwary bird (No worthless prize) entangled in his snare; While one, less active, with round rosy cheeks, Spreads out his purple fingers to the fire, And peeps most wistfully into the pot. But let us leave the warm and cheerful house To view the bleak and dreary scene without, And mark the dawning of a Winter day. The morning vapour rests upon the heights, Lurid and red, while growing gradual shades Of pale and sickly light spread o'er the sky. Then slowly from behind the southern hills Enlarged and ruddy comes the rising sun, Shooting athwart the hoary waste his beams That gild the brow of every ridgy bank, And deepen every valley with a shade, The crusted window of each scatter'd cot, The icicles that fringe the thatched roof, The new-swept slide upon the frozen pool, All keenly glance, new kindled with his rays; And e'en the rugged face of scowling Winter Looks somewhat gay. But only for a time He shows his glory to the brightening earth, Then hides his face behind a sullen cloud. The birds now quit their holes and lurking sheds, Most mute and melancholy, where through night, All nestling close to keep each other warm, In downy sleep they had forgot their hardships; But not to chant and carol in the air, Or lightly swing upon some waving bough, And merrily return each other's notes; No; silently they hop from bush to bush, Can find no seeds to stop their craving want, Then bend their flight to the low smoking cot, Chirp on the roof, or at the window peck, To tell their wants to those who lodge within. The poor lank hare flies homeward to his den, But little burthen'd with his nightly meal Of wither'd coleworts from the farmer's garden; A wretched scanty portion, snatch'd in fear; And fearful creatures, forced abroad by hunger, Are now to every enemy a prey. The husbandman lays by his heavy flail, And to the house returns, where for him wait His smoking breakfast and impatient children, Who, spoon in hand, and ready to begin, Toward the door cast many an eager look To see their dad come in. Then round they sit, a cheerful company; All quickly set to work, and with heap'd spoons From ear to ear besmear their rosy cheeks. The faithful dog stands by his master's side Wagging his tail and looking in his face; While humble puss pays court to all around, And purs and rubs them with her furry sides, Nor goes this little flattery unrewarded. But the laborious sit not long at table; The grateful father lifts his eyes to heaven To bless his God, whose ever bounteous hand Him and his little ones doth daily feed, Then rises satisfied to work again. The varied rousing sounds of industry Are heard through all the village. The humming wheel, the thrifty housewife's tongue, Who scolds to keep her maidens to their work, The wool-card's grating, most unmusical! Issue from every house. But hark! the sportsman from the neighbouring hedge His thunder sends! loud bark the village curs; Up from her cards or wheel the maiden starts And hastens to the door; the housewife chides, Yet runs herself to look, in spite of thrift, And all the little town is in a stir. Strutting before, the cock leads forth his train, And chuckling near the barn-door 'mid the straw, Reminds the farmer of his morning's service. His grateful master throws a liberal handful; They flock about it, while the hungry sparrows Perch'd on the roof, look down with envious eye, Then, aiming well, amidst the feeders light, And seize upon the feast with greedy bill, Till angry partlets peck them off the field. But at a distance, on the leafless tree, All woe-begone, the lonely blackbird sits; The cold north wind ruffles his glossy feathers; Full oft he looks, but dares not make approach, Then turns his yellow beak to peck his side And claps his wings close to his sharpen'd breast. The wandering fowler from behind the hedge, Fastens his eye upon him, points his gun, And firing wantonly, as at a mark, Of life bereaves him in the cheerful spot That oft hath echo'd to his summer's song. The mid-day hour is near, the pent-up kine Are driven from their stalls to take the air. How stupidly they stare! and feel how strange! They open wide their smoking mouths to low, But scarcely can their feeble sound be heard, Then turn and lick themselves, and step by step, Move, dull and heavy, to their stalls again. In scatter'd groups the little idle boys, With purple fingers moulding in the snow Their icy ammunition, pant for war; And drawing up in opposite array, Send forth a mighty shower of well-aim'd balls. Each tiny hero tries his growing strength, And burns to beat the foe-men off the field. Or on the well-worn ice in eager throngs, After short race, shoot rapidly along, Trip up each other's heels, and on the surface With studded shoes draw many a chalky line. Untired and glowing with the healthful sport They cease not till the sun hath run his course, And threatening clouds, slow rising from the north, Spread leaden darkness o'er the face of heaven; Then by degrees they scatter to their homes, Some with a broken head or bloody nose, To claim their mother's pity, who, most skilful! Cures all their troubles with a bit of bread. The night comes on apaceâ Chill blows the blast and drives the snow in wreaths; Now every creature looks around for shelter, And whether man or beast, all move alike Towards their homes, and happy they who have A house to screen them from the piercing cold! Lo, o'er the frost a reverend form advances! His hair white as the snow on which he treads, His forehead mark'd with many a care-worn furrow, Whose feeble body bending o'er a staff, Shows still that once it was the seat of strength, Though now it shakes like some old ruin'd tower. Clothed indeed, but not disgraced with rags, He still maintains that decent dignity Which well becomes those who have served their country. With tottering steps he gains the cottage door; The wife within, who hears his hollow cough, And pattering of his stick upon the threshold, Sends out her little boy to see who's there. The child looks up to mark the stranger's face, And, seeing it enlighten'd with a smile, Holds out his tiny hand to lead him in. Round from her work the mother turns her head, And views them, not ill pleased. The stranger whines not with a piteous tale, But only asks a little to relieve A poor old soldier's wants. The gentle matron brings the ready chair And bids him sit to rest his weary limbs, And warm himself before her blazing fire. The children, full of curiosity, Flock round, and with their fingers in their mouths Stand staring at him, while the stranger, pleased, Takes up the youngest urchin on his knee. Proud of its seat, it wags its little feet, And prates and laughs and plays with his white locks. But soon a change comes o'er the soldier's face; His thoughtful mind is turn'd on other days, When his own boys were wont to play around him, Who now lie distant from their native land In honourable but untimely graves: He feels how helpless and forlorn he is, And big, round tears course down his wither'd cheeks. His toilsome daily labour at an end, In comes the wearied master of the house, And marks with satisfaction his old guest, In the chief seat, with all the children round him. His honest heart is fill'd with manly kindness, He bids him stay and share their homely meal, And take with them his quarters for the night, The aged wanderer thankfully accepts, And by the simple hospitable board, Forgets the by-past hardships of the day. When all are satisfied, about the fire They draw their seats and form a cheerful ring, The thrifty housewife turns her spinning-wheel; The husband, useful even in his hour Of ease and rest, a stocking knits, belike, Or plaits stored rushes, which with after skill Into a basket form'd may do good service, With eggs or butter fill'd at fair or market. Some idle neighbours now come dropping in, Draw round their chairs and widen out the circle; And every one in his own native way Does what he can to cheer the social group. Each tells some little story of himself, That constant subject upon which mankind, Whether in court or country, love to dwell. How at a fair he saved a simple clown From being trick'd in buying of a cow; Or laid a bet on his own horse's head Against his neighbour's bought at twice his cost, Which fail'd not to repay his better skill; Or on a harvest day bound in an hour More sheaves of corn than any of his fellows, Though ere so stark, could do in twice the time; Or won the bridal race with savoury broose And first kiss of the bonny bride, though all The fleetest youngsters of the parish strove In rivalry against him. But chiefly the good man, by his own fire, Hath privilege of being listen'd to, Nor dares a little prattling tongue presume Though but in play, to break upon his story. The children sit and listen with the rest; And should the youngest raise its lisping voice, The careful mother, ever on the watch, And ever pleased with what her husband says, Gives it a gentle tap upon the fingers, Or stops its ill-timed prattle with a kiss. The soldier next, but not unask'd, begins His tale of war and blood. They gaze upon him, And almost weep to see the man so poor, So bent and feeble, helpless and forlorn, Who has undaunted stood the battle's brunt While roaring cannons shook the quaking earth, And bullets hiss'd round his defenceless head. Thus passes quickly on the evening hour, Till sober folks must needs retire to rest; Then all break up, and, by their several paths, Hie homeward, with the evening pastime cheer'd Far more, belike, than those who issue forth From city theatre's gay scenic show, Or crowded ball-room's splendid moving maze. But where the song and story, joke and gibe, So lately circled, what a solemn change In little time takes place! The sound of psalms, by mingled voices raised Of young and old, upon the night air borne, Haply to some benighted traveller, Or the late parted neighbours on their way, A pleasing notice gives, that those whose sires In former days on the bare mountain's side, In deserts, heaths, and caverns, praise and prayer, At peril of their lives, in their own form Of covenanted worship offered up, In peace and safety in their own quiet home Areâ(as in quaint and modest phrase is termed) Engaged now in evening exercise. But long accustom'd to observe the weather, The farmer cannot lay him down in peace Till he has look'd to mark what bodes the night. He lifts the latch, and moves the heavy door, Sees wreaths of snow heap'd up on every side, And black and dismal all above his head. Anon the northern blast begins to rise, He hears its hollow growling from afar, Which, gathering strength, rolls on with doubled might, And raves and bellows o'er his head. The trees Like pithless saplings bend. He shuts his door, And, thankful for the roof that covers him, Hies him to bed. A SUMMER'S DAY. The dark-blue clouds of night, in dusky lines Drawn wide and streaky o'er the purer sky, Wear faintly morning purple on their skirts. The stars, that full and bright shone in the west, But dimly twinkle to the steadfast eye, And seen and vanishing and seen again, Like dying tapers winking in the socket, Are by degrees shut from the face of heaven; The fitful lightning of the summer cloud, And every lesser flame that shone by night; The wandering fire that seems, across the marsh, A beaming candle in a lonely cot, Cheering the hopes of the benighted hind, Till, swifter than the very change of thought, It shifts from place to place, eludes his sight, And makes him wondering rub his faithless eyes; The humble glow-worm and the silver moth, That cast a doubtful glimmering o'er the green,â All die away. For now the sun, slow moving in his glory, Above the eastern mountains lifts his head; The webs of dew spread o'er the hoary lawn, The smooth, clear bosom of the settled pool, The polish'd ploughshare on the distant field, Catch fire from him, and dart their new-gain'd beams Upon the gazing rustic's dazzled sight. The waken'd birds upon the branches hop, Peck their soft down, and bristle out their feathers, Then stretch their throats and trill their morning song; While dusky crows, high swinging over head, Upon the topmost boughs, in lordly pride, Mix their hoarse croaking with the linnet's note, Till in a gather'd band of close array, They take their flight to seek their daily food. The villager wakes with the early light, That through the window of his cot appears, And quits his easy bed; then o'er the fields With lengthen'd active strides betakes his way, Bearing his spade or hoe across his shoulder, Seen glancing as he moves, and with good will His daily work begins. The sturdy sun-burnt boy drives forth the cattle, And, pleased with power, bawls to the lagging kine With stern authority, who fain would stop To crop the tempting bushes as they pass. At every open door, in lawn or lane, Half naked children half awake are seen, Scratching their heads and blinking to the light, Till, rousing by degrees, they run about, Roll on the sward and in some sandy nook Dig caves, and houses build, full oft defaced And oft begun again, a daily pastime. The housewife, up by times, her morning cares Tends busily; from tubs of curdled milk With skilful patience draws the clear green whey From the press'd bosom of the snowy curd, While her brown comely maid, with tuck'd-up sleeves And swelling arm, assists her. Work proceeds, Pots smoke, pails rattle, and the warm confusion Still more confused becomes, till in the mould With heavy hands the well-squeezed curd is placed. So goes the morning till the powerful sun, High in the heavens, sends down his strengthen'd beams, And all the freshness of the morn is fled. The idle horse upon the grassy field Rolls on his back; the swain leaves off his toil, And to his house with heavy steps returns, Where on the board his ready breakfast placed Looks most invitingly, and his good mate Serves him with cheerful kindness. Upon the grass no longer hangs the dew; Forth hies the mower with his glittering seythe, In snowy shirt bedight and all unbraced, He moves athwart the mead with sideling bend, And lays the grass in many a swathey line; In every field, in every lawn and meadow The rousing voice of industry is heard; The hay-cock rises, and the frequent rake Sweeps on the fragrant hay in heavy wreaths. The old and young, the weak and strong are there, And, as they can, help on the cheerful work. The father jeers his awkward half-grown lad, Who trails his tawdry armful o'er the field, Nor does he fear the jeering to repay. The village oracle and simple maid Jest in their turns and raise the ready laugh; All are companions in the general glee; Authority, hard favour'd, frowns not there. Some, more advanced, raise up the lofty rick, Whilst on its top doth stand the parish toast In loose attire, with swelling ruddy cheek. With taunts and harmless mockery she receives The toss'd-up heaps from fork of simple youth, Who, staring on her, takes his aim awry, While half the load falls back upon himself. Loud is her laugh, her voice is heard afar; The mower busied on the distant lawn, The carter trudging on his dusty way, The shrill sound know, their bonnets toss in the air, And roar across the field to catch her notice: She waves her arm to them, and shakes her head, And then renews her work with double spirit. Thus do they jest and laugh away their toil Till the bright sun, now past his middle course, Shoots down his fiercest beams which none may brave. The stoutest arm feels listless, and the swart And brawny-shoulder'd clown begins to fail. But to the weary, loâthere comes relief! A troop of welcome children o'er the lawn With slow and wary steps approach, some bear In baskets oaten cakes or barley scones, And gusty cheese and stoups of milk or whey. Beneath the branches of a spreading tree, Or by the shady side of the tall rick, They spread their homely fare, and seated round, Taste every pleasure that a feast can give. A drowsy indolence now hangs on all; Each creature seeks some place of rest, some shelter From the oppressive heat; silence prevails; Nor low nor bark nor chirping bird are heard. In shady nooks the sheep and kine convene; Within the narrow shadow of the cot The sleepy dog lies stretch'd upon his side, Nor heeds the footsteps of the passer-by, Or at the sound but raises half an eye-lid, Then gives a feeble growl and sleeps again; While puss composed and grave on threshold stone Sits winking in the light. No sound is heard but humming of the bee, For she alone retires not from her labour, Nor leaves a meadow flower unsought for gain. Heavy and slow, so pass the sultry hours, Till gently bending on the ridge's top The drooping seedy grass begins to wave, And the high branches of the aspen tree Shiver the leaves and gentle rustling make. Cool breathes the rising breeze, and with it wakes The languid spirit from its state of stupor. The lazy boy springs from his mossy lair To chase the gaudy butterfly, which oft Lights at his feet as if within his reach, Spreading upon the ground its mealy wings, Yet still eludes his grasp, and high in air Takes many a circling flight, tempting his eye And tiring his young limbs. The drowsy dog, who feels the kindly air That passing o'er him lifts his shaggy ear, Begins to stretch him, on his legs half-raised, Till fully waked, with bristling cock'd-up tail, He makes the village echo to his bark. But let us not forget the busy maid, Who by the side of the clear pebbly stream Spreads out her snowy linens to the sun, And sheds with liberal hand the crystal shower O'er many a favourite piece of fair attire, Revolving in her mind her gay appearance, So nicely trick'd, at some approaching fair. The dimpling half-check'd smile and muttering lip Her secret thoughts betray. With shiny feet, There, little active bands of truant boys Sport in the stream and dash the water round, Or try with wily art to catch the trout, Or with their fingers grasp the slippery eel. The shepherd-lad sits singing on the bank To while away the weary lonely hours, Weaving with art his pointed crown of rushes, A guiltless easy crown, which, having made, He places on his head, and skips about, A chaunted rhyme repeats, or calls full loud To some companion lonely as himself, Far on the distant bank; or else delighted To hear the echo'd sound of his own voice, Returning answer from some neighbouring rock, Or roofless barn, holds converse with himself. Now weary labourers perceive well pleased The shadows lengthen, and the oppressive day With all its toil fast wearing to an end. The sun, far in the west, with level beam Gleams on the cocks of hay, on bush or ridge, And fields are checker'd with fantastic shapes, Or tree or shrub or gate or human form, All lengthen'd out in antic disproportion Upon the darken'd ground. Their task is finish'd, Their rakes and scatter'd garments gather'd up, And all right gladly to their homes return. The village, lone and silent through the day, Receiving from the fields its merry bands, Sends forth its evening sound, confused but cheerful; Yelping of curs, and voices stern and shrill, And true-love ballads in no plaintive strain, By household maid at open window sung; And lowing of the home-returning kine, And herd's dull droning trump and tinkling bell, Tied to the collar of the master-sheep, Make no contemptible variety To ears not over nice. With careless lounging gait the favour'd youth Upon his sweetheart's open window leans, Diverting her with joke and harmless taunt. Close by the cottage door, with placid mien, The old man sits upon his seat of turf, His staff with crooked head laid by his side, Which oft some tricky youngling steals away, And straddling o'er it shows his horsemanship By raising clouds of sand; he smiles thereat, But seems to chide him sharply: His silver locks upon his shoulders fall, And not ungraceful is his stoop of age. No stranger passes him without regard, And neighbours stop to wish him a good e'en, And ask him his opinion of the weather. They fret not at the length of his remarks Upon the various seasons he remembers; For well he knows the many divers signs That do foretell high winds, or rain, or drought, Or aught that may affect the rising crops. The silken-clad, who courtly breeding boast, Their own discourse still sweetest to their ear, May at the old man's lengthen'd story fret, Impatiently, but here it is not so. From every chimney mounts the curling smoke, Muddy and grey, of the new evening fire; On every window smokes the family supper, Set out to cool by the attentive housewife, While cheerful groups, at every door convened, Bawl 'cross the narrow lane the parish news, And oft the bursting laugh disturbs the air. But see who comes to set them all agape; The weary-footed pedlar with his pack; Stiffly he bends beneath his bulky load, Cover'd with dust, slip-shod and out at elbows; His greasy hat set backwards on his head; His thin straight hair, divided on his brow, Hangs lank on either side his glist'ning cheeks, And woe-begone yet vacant is his face. His box he opens and displays his ware. Full many a varied row of precious stones Cast forth their dazzling lustre to the light And ruby rings and china buttons, stamp'd With love devices, the desiring maid And simple youth attract; while streaming garters, Of many colours, fasten'd to a pole, Aloft in air their gaudy stripes display, And from afar the distant stragglers lure. The children leave their play and round him flock; Even sober, aged grandame quits her seat, Where by the door she twines her lengthen'd threads, Her spindle stops, and lays her distaff by, Then joins with step sedate the curious throng. She praises much the fashions of her youth, And scorns each useless nonsense of the day; Yet not ill-pleased the glossy riband views, Unroll'd and changing hues with every fold, Just measured out to deck her grandchild's head. Now red but languid the last beams appear Of the departed sun, across the lawn, Gilding each sweepy ridge on many a field, And from the openings of the distant hills A level brightness pouring, sad though bright; Like farewell smiles from some dear friend they seem, And only serve to deepen the low vale, And make the shadows of the night more gloomy. The varied noises of the cheerful village By slow degrees now faintly die away, And more distinctly distant sounds are heard That gently steal adown the river's bed, Or through the wood come on the ruffing breeze. The white mist rises from the meads, and from The dappled skirting of the sober sky Looks out with steady gleam the evening star. The lover, skulking in some neighbouring copse, (Whose half-seen form, shown through the dusky air Large and majestic, makes the traveller start, And spreads the story of a haunted grove,) Curses the owl, whose loud ill-omen'd hoot With ceaseless spite takes from his listening ear The well-known footsteps of his darling maid, And fretful chases from his face the night-fly, That, buzzing round his head, doth often skim With fluttering wings across his glowing cheek For all but him in quiet balmy sleep Forget the toils of the oppressive day; Shut is the door of every scatter'd cot. And silence dwells within. NIGHT SCENES OF OTHER TIMES. A POEM, IN THREE PARTS. PART I. âThe night winds bellow o'er my head, Dim grows the fading light; Where shall I find some friendly shed To screen me from the night? âAh! round me lies a desert vast, No habitation near; And dark and pathless is the waste, And fills my mind with fear. âThou distant tree, whose lonely top Has bent to many a storm, No more canst thou deceive my hope And take my lover's form; âFor o'er thy head the dark cloud rolls, Dark as thy blasted pride; How deep the angry tempest growls Along the mountain's side! âSafely within the shaggy brake Are crouch'd the mountain deer; A sound unbroken sleep they take; No haunts of men are near. âBeneath the fern the moorcock sleeps And twisted adders lie; Back to his rock the night-bird creeps, Nor gives his wonted cry. âFor angry spirits of the night Ride on the troubled air, And to their dens in strange affright The beasts of prey repair. âBut thou, my love! where dost thou rest? What shelter covers thee? O may this cold and wintry blast But only beat on me! âSome friendly dwelling mayst thou find, Where sleep may banish care, And thou feel not the chilly wind That scatters Margaret's hair. âAh no! for thou didst give thy word To meet me on the way: Nor friendly roof nor social board Will tempt a lover's stay. âO raise thy voice if thou art near! Its weakest sound were bliss; What other sound my heart can cheer In such a gloom as this? âBut from the hills with deafening roar The dashing torrents fall, And heavy beats the drifted shower, And mocks a lover's call. âHa! see across the dreary waste, A moving form appears, It is my love, my cares are past; How vain were all my fears!â The form advanced, but sad and slow, Not with a lover's tread; And from his cheek the youthful glow And greeting smile were fled. Dim sadness sat upon his brow; Fix'd was his beamless eye; His face was like a moonlight bow Upon a wintry sky. And fix'd and ghastly to the sight His strengthen'd features rose, And bended was his graceful height, And bloody were his clothes. âMy Margaret, calm thy troubled breast; Thy sorrow now is vain! Thy Edward from his peaceful rest Shall ne'er return again. âA treacherous friend has laid me low, Has fix'd my early doom, And laid my corse with feigned woe Beneath a vaulted tomb. âTo take thee to my home I sware, And here we were to meet; Wilt thou a narrow coffin share, And part my winding-sheet? âBut late the lord of many lands. And now a grave is all: My blood is warm upon his hands Who revels in my hall. âYet think, thy father's hoary hair Is water'd with his tears; He has but thee to soothe his care, And drop his load of years. âRemember Edward when he's gone! He only lived for thee; And when thou art pensive and alone, Dear Margaret, call on me! âThough deep beneath the mouldering clod I rest my wounded head, And terrible that call and loud Which shall awake the dead!â âNo, Edward; I will follow thee, And share thy hapless doom; Companions shall our spirits be, Though distant is thy tomb. âOh! never to my father's tower Will I return again; A bleeding heart has little power To ease another's pain. âUpon the wing my spirit flies, I feel my course is run; Nor shall these dim and weary eyes Behold to-morrow's sun.â Like early dew, or hoary frost Spent with the beaming day, So shrank the pale and watery ghost, And dimly wore away. No longer Margaret felt the storm, She bow'd her lovely head, And, with her lover's fleeting form, Her gentle spirit fled. PART II. âLoud roars the wind that shakes the wall, It is no common blast: Deep hollow sounds pass through my hall: O would the night were past! âMethinks the demons of the air Upon the turrets growl, While down the empty winding stair Their deep'ning murmurs roll. âThe glimmering fire cheers not the gloom, Blue burns the quivering ray, And, like a taper in a tomb, But spreads the more dismay. âAthwart its melancholy light The lengthen'd shadow falls; My grandsires to my troubled sight Lower on me from these walls. âMethinks yon angry warrior's head Doth in its panel frown, And dart a look, as if it said, âWhere hast thou laid my son?â âBut will these fancies never cease? O would the night were run! My troubled soul can find no peace But with the morning sun. âVain hope! the guilty never rest: Dismay is always near; There is a midnight in the breast No morn shall ever cheer. âNow soundly sleeps the weary hind, Though lowly lies his head; An easy lair the guiltless find Upon the hardest bed. âThe beggar, in his wretched haunt, May now a monarch be; Forget his woe, forget his want, For all can sleep but me. âI've dared whate'er the boldest can, Then why this childish dread? I never fear'd a living man, And shall I fear the dead? âNo; whistling blasts may shake my tower, And passing spirits scream: Their shadowy arms are void of power, And but a gloomy dream. âBut lo! a form advancing slow Across the dusky hall, Art thou a friend?âart thou a foe? O answer to my call!â Still nearer to the glimmering light The stately figure strode, Till full, and horrid to the sight, The murther'd Edward stood. A broken shaft his right hand sway'd, Like Time's dark threat'ning dart, And pointed to a rugged blade That quiver'd in his heart. The blood still trickled from his head, And clotted was his hair: His severed vesture stain'd and red; His mangled breast was bare. His face was like a muddy sky Before the coming snow; And dark and dreadful was his eye, And cloudy was his brow. Pale Conrad shrank, but drew his swordâ Fear thrill'd in every vein; His quivering lips gave out no word; He paused, and shrank again. Then utterance cameââAt this dread hour Why dost thou haunt the night? Has the deep gloomy vault no power To keep thee from my sight? âWhy dost thou glare and slowly wave That fatal shaft of strife? The deed is done, and from the grave Who can recall to life? âWhy roll thine eyes beneath thy brow Dark as the midnight storm? What dost thou want? O let me know, But hide thy dreadful form. âI'd give the life-blood from my heart To wash my crime away: If thou a spirit be, depart, Nor haunt a wretch of clay! âSay, dost thou with the blessed dwell?â Return and blessed be! Or com'st thou from the lowest hell?â I am more cursed than thee.â The form advanced with solemn steps As if it meant to speak, And seem'd to move its pallid lips, But silence did not break. Then sternly stalk'd with heavy pace Which shook the floor and wall, And turn'd away its fearful face, And vanish'd from the hall. Transfix'd and powerless, Conrad stood; Ears ring, and eyeballs swell; Back to his heart runs the cold blood; Into a trance he fell. Night fled, and through the windows 'gan The early light to play; But on a more unhappy man Ne'er shone the dawning day. The gladsome sun all nature cheers, But cannot charm his cares; Still dwells his mind with gloomy fears, And murder'd Edward glares. PART III. âNo rest nor comfort can I find: I watch the midnight hour; I sit and listen to the wind That beats upon my tower. âMethinks low voices from the ground Break mournful on my ear, And through these empty chambers sound, So dismal and so drear! âThe ghost of some departed friend Doth in my sorrows share; Or is it but the rushing wind That mocketh my despair? âSad through the hall the pale lamp gleams Upon my father's arms; My soul is filled with gloomy dreams, I fear unknown alarms. âO, I have known this lonely place With every blessing stored, And many a friend with cheerful face Sit smiling at my board! âWhile round the hearth, in early bloom, My harmless children play'd, Who now within the narrow tomb Are with their mother laid. âNow sadly bends my wretched head, And those I loved are gone: My friends, my family, all are fled, And I am left alone. âOft as the cheerless fire declines, In it I sadly trace, As lone I sit, the half-form'd lines Of many a much-loved face. âBut chiefly, Margaret, to my mind, Thy lovely features rise; I strive to think thee less unkind, And wipe my streaming eyes. âFor only thee I had to vaunt, Thou wast thy mother's pride; She left thee like a shooting plant, To screen my widow'd side. âBut thou forsakest me, weak, forlorn, And chill'd with age's frost, To count my weary days and mourn The comforts I have lost. âUnkindly child! why didst thou go? O, had I known the truth! Though Edward's father was my foe, I would have bless'd the youth. âCould I but see that face again, Whose smile calm'd every strife, And hear that voice which soothed my pain And made me wish for life! âThy harp hangs silent by the wall: My nights are sad and long, And thou art in a distant hall, Where strangers raise the song. âHa! some delusion of the mind My senses doth confound! It was the harp, and not the wind, That did so sweetly sound.â Old Arno rose all wan as death, And turn'd his eager ear, And check'd the while his quicken'd breath The sound again to hear. When, like a full, but distant choir, The swelling notes return'd; And with the softly trembling wire Surrounding echoes mourn'd; Then softly whisper'd o'er the song That Margaret loved to play; Its well-known measure linger'd long, And faintly died away. His dim-worn eyes to heaven he cast, Where all his griefs were known, And smote upon his troubled breast, And heaved a heavy groan. âI know it is my daughter's hand, But 'tis no hand of clay; And here a lonely wretch I stand, All childless, bent, and gray. âAnd art thou low, my lovely child, And hast thou met thy doom, And has thy flattering morning smiled To lead but to the tomb? âO let me see thee ere we part, For souls like thine are blest; O let me fold thee to my heart, If aught of form thou hast! âThis passing mist conceals thy shape, But it is shrunk or flown; Why dost thou from mine arms escape, Art thou not still mine own? âThou'rt fled like the low evening breath, That sighs upon the hill: O stay! though in thy weeds of death,â Thou art my daughter still.â Loud waked the sound, then fainter grew, And long and sadly mourn'd, And softly sigh'd a long adieu, And never more return'd. Old Arno stretch'd him on the ground; Thick as the gloom of night, Death's misty shadows gather'd round, And swam before his sight. He heaved a deep and deadly groan, That rent his labouring breast, And long before the morning shone, His spirit was at rest. ADDRESS TO THE MUSES. Ye tuneful sisters of the lyre, Who dreams and fantasies inspire, Who over poesy preside, And on a lofty hill abide Above the ken of mortal sight, Fain would I sing of you, could I address you right. Thus known, your power of old was sung. And temples with your praises rung; And when the song of battle rose, Or kindling wine or lover's woes, The Poet's spirit inly burn'd, And still to you his upcast eyes were turn'd. The youth, all wrapp'd in vision bright, Beheld your robes of flowing white; And knew your forms benignly grand,â An awful but a lovely band; And felt your inspiration strong, And warmly pour'd his rapid lay along. The aged bard all heavenward glow'd, And hail'd you daughters of a God. Though by his dimmer eyes were seen Nor graceful form nor heavenly mien, Full well he felt that ye were near, And heard you in the breeze that raised his hoary hair. Ye lighten'd up the valley's bloom, And gave the forest deeper gloom; The mountain peak sublimer stood, And grander rose the mighty flood; For then Religion lent her aid, And o'er the mind of man your sacred empire spread. Though rolling ages now are past, And altars low and temples waste; Though rites and oracles are o'er, And Gods and heroes rule no more, Your fading honours still remain, And still your votaries call, a long and motley train. They seek you not on hill or plain, Nor court you in the sacred fane; Nor meet you in the mid-day dream, Upon the bank of hallow'd stream; Yet still for inspiration sue, And still each lifts his fervent prayer to you. He woos you not in woodland gloom, But in the close and shelfed room, And seeks you in the dusty nook, And meets you in the letter'd book: Full well he knows you by your names, And still with poet's faith your presence claims. Now youthful Poet, pen in hand, All by the side of blotted stand, In reverie deep which none may break, Sits rubbing of his beardless cheek, And well his inspiration knows, E'en by the dewy drops that trickle o'er his nose. The tuneful sage, of riper fame, Perceives you not in heated frame; But at conclusion of his verse, Which still his muttering lips rehearse, Oft waves his hand in grateful pride, And owns the heavenly power that did his fancy guide. O lovely Sisters! is it true That they are all inspired by you, And write by inward magic charm'd, And high enthusiasm warm'd? We dare not question heavenly lays, And well, I wot, they give you all the praise. O lovely Sisters! well it shows How wide and far your bounty flows. Then why from me withhold your beams? Unvisited of vision'd dreams, Whene'er I aim at heights sublime, Still downward am I call'd to seek some stubborn rhyme. No hasty lightning breaks my gloom, Nor flashing thoughts unsought for come, Nor fancies wake in time of need: I labour much with little speed, And when my studied task is done, Too well, alas! I mark it for my own. Yet should you never smile on me, And rugged still my verses be, Unpleasing to the tuneful train, Who only prize a flowing strain, And still the learned scorn my lays, I'll lift my heart to you and sing your praise. Your varied ministry of grace, Your honour'd names and godlike race, Your sacred caves where fountains flow They will rehearse, who better know; I praise you not with Grecian lyre, Nor hail you daughters of a heathen sire. Ye are the spirits who preside In earth and air and ocean wide, In rushing flood and crackling fire, In horror dread and tumult dire, In stilly calm and stormy wind, And rule the answering changes in the human mind! High on the tempest-beaten hill, Your misty shapes ye shift at will; The wild fantastic clouds ye form; Your voice is in the midnight storm; While in the dark and lonely hour Oft starts the boldest heart, and owns your secret power. When lightning ceases on the waste, And when the battle's broil is past, When scenes of strife and blood are o'er, And groans of death are heard no more. Ye then renew each sound and form, Like after echoing of the o'erpassed storm. The shining day and nightly shade, The cheerful plain and sunny glade; The homeward kine, the children's play, The busy hamlet's closing day, Give pleasure to the peasant's heart, Who lacks the gift his feelings to impart. Oft when the moon looks from on high, And black around the shadows lie, And bright the sparkling waters gleam, And rushes rustle by the stream, Voices and fairy forms are known By simple folk who wander late alone. Ye kindle up the inward glow, Ye strengthen every outward show, Ye overleap the strongest bar And join what nature sunders far, And visit oft, in fancies wild, The breast of learned sage and simple child. From him who wears a monarch's crown To the unletter'd simple clown, All in some fitful, lonely hour Have felt, unsought, your secret power, And loved your inward visions well; You add but to the bard the art to tell. Ye mighty spirits of the song, To whom the poet's prayers belong, My lowly bosom to inspire And kindle with your sacred fire, Your wild and dizzy heights to brave, Is boon, alas! too great for me to crave. But O, such sense of nature bring! As they who feel, and never sing, Wear on their hearts; it will avail With simple words to tell my tale; And still contented will I be, Though greater inspiration never fall to me. A MELANCHOLY LOVER'S FAREWELL TO HIS MISTRESS. Dear Phillis, all my hopes are o'er, And I shall see thy face no more. Since every secret wish is vain, I will not stay to give thee pain. Then do not drop thy lowering brow, But let me bless thee ere I go; Oh! do not scorn my last adieu! I've loved thee long, and loved thee true The prospects of my youth are crost, My health is flown, my vigour lost; My soothing friends augment my pain, And cheerless is my native plain; Dark o'er my spirit hangs the gloom, And thy disdain has fix'd my doom. But light waves ripple o'er the sea That soon shall bear me far from thee; And, wheresoe'er our course be cast, I know 'twill bear me to my rest. Full deep beneath the briny wave, Where lie the venturous and brave, A place may be for me decreed; But, should the winds my passage speed, Far hence upon a foreign land, Whose sons perhaps with friendly hand The stranger's lowly tomb may raise, A broken heart will end my days. But heaven's blessing on thee rest! And may no troubles vex thy breast! Perhaps, when pensive and alone, You'll think of me when I am gone, And gentle tears of pity shed, When I am in my narrow bed. But softly will thy sorrows flow, And greater mayst thou never know! Free from all worldly care and strife, Long mayst thou live a happy life! And every earthly blessing find, Thou loveliest of woman kind: Yea, blest thy secret wishes be, Though cruel thou hast proved to me! And dost thou then thine arm extend? And may I take thy lovely hand? And do thine eyes thus gently look, As though some kindly wish they spoke? My gentle Phillis, though severe, I do not grudge the ills I bear; But still my greatest grief will be To think my love has troubled thee. Oh do not scorn this swelling grief! The laden bosom seeks relief; Nor yet this infant weakness blame, For thou hast made me what I am. Hark now! the sailors call away, No longer may I lingering stay. May peace within thy mansion dwell! O gentle Phillis, fare thee well! A CHEERFUL-TEMPERED LOVER'S FAREWELL TO HIS MISTRESS The light winds on the streamers play That soon shall bear me far away; My comrades give the parting cheer, And I alone have linger'd here. Now, dearest Phill, since it will be, And I must bid farewell to theeâ Since every cherish'd hope is flown, Send me not from thee with a frown, But kindly let me take thy hand, And bid God bless me in a foreign land. No more I'll loiter by thy side, Well pleased thy gamesome taunts to bide; Nor lover's gambols lightly try To make me graceful in thine eye; Nor sing a merry roundelay To cheer thee at the close of day. Yet ne'ertheless, though we must part, I'll have thee still within my heart; Still to thy health my glass I'll fill, And drink it with a right good-will. Far hence upon a foreign shore, There will I keep an open door, And there my little fortune share With all who ever breathed my native air. And he who once thy face hath seen, Or ever near thy dwelling been, Shall freely push the flowing bowl And be the master of the whole. And every woman, for thy sake, Shall of my slender store partake, Shall in my home protection find, Thou fairest of a fickle kind! O dearly, dearly have I paid, Thou little, haughty, cruel maid! To give that inward peace to thee, Which thou hast ta'en away from me. Soft hast thou slept with bosom light, While I have watch'd the weary night; And now I cross the surgy deep That thou mayst still untroubled sleep. But in thine eyes what do I see That looks as though they pitied me? I thank thee, Phillis; be not sad, I leave no blame upon thy head. To gain thy gentle heart I strove, But ne'er was worthy of thy love. And yet, perhaps, when I shall dwell Far hence, thou'lt sometimes think how wellâ I dare not stay, since we must part, To expose a fond and foolish heart; Where'er it goes, it beats for you, God bless you, Phill, adieu! adieu! A PROUD LOVER'S FAREWELL TO HIS MISTRESS. Farewell, thou haughty, cruel fair! Upon thy brow no longer wear That sombre look of cold disdain; I ne'er shall see thy face again. Now every foolish wish is o'er, And fears and doubtings are no more. All cruel as thou art to me, Long has my heart been fix'd on thee. I've track'd thy footsteps o'er the green, And shared thy rambles oft unseen; I've linger'd near thee night and day, When thou hast thought me far away! I've watch'd the changes of thy face, And fondly mark'd thy moving grace; I've wept with joy thy smiles to see; I've been a fool for love of thee. Yet do not think I stay the while Thy feeble pity to beguile: Let favour forced still fruitless prove! The pity cursed that brings not love! No woman e'er shall give me pain, Or ever break my rest again: Nor aught that comes of womankind Again have power to move my mind. Far on a foreign shore I'll seek Some lonely island bare and bleak; There find some wild and rocky cell, And with the untamed creatures dwell. To hear their cries is now my choice, Rather than man's deceitful voice; To hear the tempest's boisterous song, Than woman's softly witching tongue; They wear no guise, nor promise good, But rugged seem as they are rude. O Phillis! thou hast wreck'd a heart That proudly bears, but feels the smart. Adieu, adieu! shouldst thou e'er prove The pangs of ill requited love, Thou'lt know what I have borne for thee, And then thou wilt remember me. A POETICAL OR SOUND-HEARTED LOVER'S FAREWELL TO HIS MISTRESS. Fair Nymph, who dost my fate controul, And reignest Mistress of my soul, Where thou all bright in beauty's ray Hast held a long tyrannic sway! They who the hardest rule maintain, In their commands do still refrain From what impossible must prove, Yet thou hast bid me cease to love. Ah! when the magnet's power is o'er, The needle then will point no more, And when no verdure clothes the spring, The tuneful birds forget to sing; But thou, all sweet and heavenly fair, Wouldst have thy swain from love forbear. In pity let thine own dear hand A death's-wound to this bosom send: This tender heart of purest faith May then resign thee with its breath; And in the sun-beam of thine eye A proud and willing victim die. But since thou wilt not have it so, Far from thy presence will I go; Far from my heart's dear bliss I'll stray, Since I no longer can obey. In foreign climes I'll henceforth roam, No more to hail my native home: To foreign swains I'll pour my woe, In foreign plains my tears shall flow; By murmuring stream and shady grove Shall other echoes tell my love; And richer flowers of vivid hue Upon my grave shall other maidens strew. Adieu, dear Phillis! shouldst thou e'er Some soft and plaintive story hear Of hapless youth who vainly strove With wayward fate, and died for love, O think of me! nor then deny The gentle tribute of a sigh! A REVERIE. Beside a spreading elm, from whose high boughs Like knotted tufts the crow's light dwelling shows, Screen'd from the northern blast and winter-proof, Snug stands the parson's barn with thatched roof. At chaff-strew'd door where in the morning ray The gilded motes in mazy circles play, And sleepy Comrade in the sun is laid, More grateful to the cur than neighb'ring shade: In snowy shirt, unbraced, brown Robin stood, And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood. His ruddy cheeks that wear their deepest hue, His forehead brown that glist'ning drops bedew, His neck-band loose and hosen rumpled low, A careful lad, nor slack at labour, show. Nor scraping chickens chirping in the straw, Nor croaking rook o'er-head, nor chattering daw, Loud-breathing cow among the juicy weeds, Nor grunting sow that in the furrow feeds, Nor sudden breeze that stirs the quaking leaves And makes disturbance 'mong the scatter'd sheaves, Nor floating straw that skims athwart his nose, The deeply musing youth may discompose. For Nelly fair, and blithest village maid, Whose tuneful voice beneath the hedge-row shade, At early milking o'er the meadow borne, E'er cheer'd the ploughman's toil at rising morn; The neatest maid that e'er in linen gown Bore cream and butter to the market town; The tightest lass that e'er at wake or fair Footed the ale-house floor with lightsome air, Since Easter last had Robin's heart possess'd, And many a time disturb'd his nightly rest. Full oft returning from the loosen'd plough, He slack'd his pace, and knit his careful brow; And oft, ere half his thresher's task was o'er, Would muse with arms across at cooling door. His mind thus bent, with downcast eyes he stood, And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood. His soul o'er many a soft remembrance ran, And muttering to himself the youth began. âAh! happy is the man whose early lot Hath made him master of a furnish'd cot; Who trains the vine that round his window grows, And after setting sun his garden hoes; Whose wattled pales his own enclosure shield, Who toils not daily in another's field. Where'er he goes, to church or market town, With more respect he and his dog are known, With brisker face at pedlar's booth he stands, And takes each tempting gew-gaw in his hands, And buys at will or ribands, gloves, or beads, And willing partners to the green he leads: And oh! secure from toils that cumber life, He makes the maid he loves an easy wife. Ah! Nelly! canst thou with contented mind Become the help-mate of a labouring hind, And share his lot, whate'er the chances be, Who hath no dower but love to fix on thee? Yes; gayest maid may meekest matron prove, And things of little note betoken love. When from the church thou cam'st at eventide, And I and red-hair'd Susan by thy side, I pull'd the blossoms from the bending tree, And some to Susan gave and some to thee; Thine were the fairest, and thy smiling eye The difference mark'd, and guess'd the reason why. When on that holiday we rambling stray'd, And passed Old Hodge's cottage in the glade; Neat was the garden dress'd, sweet humm'd the bee, I wish'd the Cot and Nelly made for me; And well, methought, thy very eyes reveal'd The self-same wish within thy breast conceal'd; When artful, once, I sought my love to tell, And spoke to thee of one who loved thee well, You saw the cheat, and jeering homeward hied, Yet secret pleasure in thy looks I spied. Ay, gayest maid may meekest matron prove, And smaller signs than these betoken love.â Now at a distance on the neighb'ring plain, With creaking wheels slow comes the harvest wain, High on its shaking load a maid appears, And Nelly's voice sounds shrill in Robin's ears. Quick from his hand he throws the cumbrous flail, And leaps with lightsome limbs the enclosing pale. O'er field and fence he scours, and furrow wide, With waken'd Comrade barking by his side; While tracks of trodden grain and tangled hay, And broken hedge-flowers sweet, mark his impetuous way. A DISAPPOINTMENT. On village green whose smooth and well-worn sod, Cross path'd, with many a gossip's foot is trod; By cottage door where playful children run, And cats and curs sit basking in the sun; Where o'er an earthen seat the thorn is bent, Cross-arm'd and back to wall poor William leant. His bonnet all awry, his gather'd brow, His hanging lip and lengthen'd visage show A mind but ill at ease. With motions strange His listless limbs their wayward postures change; While many a crooked line and curious maze With clouted shoon he on the sand pourtrays. At length the half-chew'd straw fell from his mouth, And to himself low spoke the moody youth. âHow simple is the lad, and reft of skill, Who thinks with love to fix a woman's will! Who every Sunday morn to please her sight, Knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white; Who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare, And half his wages spends on pedlar's ware; When every niggard clown or dotard old, Who hides in secret nooks his oft-told gold, Whose field or orchard tempts, with all her pride, At little cost may win her for his bride! While all the meed her silly lover gains, Is but the neighbours' jeering for his pains. On Sunday last, when Susan's banns were read, And I astonish'd sat with hanging head, Cold grew my shrinking frame, and loose my knee, While every neighbour's eye was fix'd on me. Ah Sue! when last we work'd at Hodge's hay, And still at me you mock'd in wanton playâ When last at fair, well pleased by chapman's stand, You took the new-bought fairing from my handâ When at old Hobb's you sang that song so gay, âSweet William,â still the burthen of the lay,â I little thought, alas! the lots were cast, That thou shouldst be another's bride at last: And had, when last we tripp'd it on the green, And laugh'd at stiff-back'd Rob, small thoughts I ween, Ere yet another scanty month was flown To see thee wedded to the hateful clown; Ay, lucky churl! more gold thy pockets line; But did these shapely limbs resemble thine, I'd stay at home and tend the household gear, Nor on the green with other lads appear. Ay, lucky churl! no store thy cottage lacks, And round thy barn thick stand the shelter'd stacks, But did such features coarse my visage grace, I'd never budge the bonnet from my face. Yet let it be; it shall not break my ease; He best deserves who doth the maiden please. Such silly cause no more shall give me pain, Nor ever maiden cross my rest again. Such grizzled suitors with their taste agree, And the black fiend may have them all for me!â Now through the village rise confused sounds, Hoarse lads, and children shrill, and yelping hounds. Straight every housewife at her door is seen, And pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean. At every narrow lane and alley's mouth, Loud-laughing lasses stand, and joking youth. A bridal band trick'd out in colours gay, With minstrels blithe before to cheer the way, From clouds of curling dust that onward fly, In rural splendour breaks upon the eye. As in their way they hold so gaily on, Caps, beads, and buttons, glancing to the sun, Each village wag with eye of roguish cast Some maiden jogs, and vents the ready jest; While village toasts the passing belles deride, And sober matrons marvel at their pride. But William, head erect with settled brow, In sullen silence view'd the passing show; And oft he scratch'd his pate with careless grace, And scorn'd to pull the bonnet o'er his face; But did with steady look unalter'd wait, Till hindmost man had pass'd the churchyard gate, Then turn'd him to his cot with visage flat, Where honest Lightfoot on the threshold sat. Up leap'd the kindly beast his hand to lick, And for his pains received an angry kick. Loud shuts the door with harsh and thundering din; The echoes round their circling course begin. From cot to cot, church tower, and rocky dell, It grows amain with wide progressive swell, And Lightfoot joins the coil with loud and piteous yell. A LAMENTATION. Where ancient broken wall encloses round, From tread of lawless feet, the hallow'd ground, And sombre yews their dewy branches wave, O'er many a graven stone and mounded grave; Where parish church, confusedly to the sight, With deeper darkness prints the shades of night, In garb deranged and loose, with scatter'd hair, His bosom open to the nightly air, Lone, o'er a new-heap'd grave poor Basil bent, And to himself began his simple plaint. âAlas, how cold thy home, how low thou art, Who wast the pride and mistress of my heart! The fallen leaves now rustling o'er thee pass, And o'er thee waves the dank and dewy grass, The new laid sods and twisted osier tell, How narrow is the space where thou must dwell. Now rough and wintry winds may on thee beat, Chill rain, and drifting snow, and summer's heat; Each passing season's rub, for woe is me! Or gloom or sunshine is the same to thee. Ah Mary! lovely was thy slender form, And bright thy cheerful brow that knew no storm. Thy steps were graceful on the village green, As though thou hadst some courtly lady been. At church or market still the gayest lass, Each youngster slack'd his speed to see thee pass. At early milking tuneful was thy lay, And sweet thy homeward song at close of day; But sweeter far, and every youth's desire, Thy cheerful converse by the evening fire. Alas! no more thou'lt foot the village sward, No song of thine shall ever more be heard, And they full soon will trip it on the green, As blithe and gay as thou hadst never been. Around the evening fire with little care Will neighbours sit, and scarcely miss thee there; And when the sober parting hour comes round, Will to their rest retire, and slumber sound, But Basil cannot rest; his days are sad, And long his nights upon the weary bed. Yet still in broken dreams thy form appears, And still my bosom proves a lover's fears. I guide thy footsteps through the tangled wood; I catch thee sinking in the boisterous flood; I shield thy bosom from the threaten'd stroke; I clasp thee falling from the headlong rock; But ere we reach the dark and dreadful deep, High heaves my troubled breast, I wake and weep. At every wailing of the midnight wind, Thy lowly dwelling comes into my mind. When rain beats on my roof, wild storms abroad, I think upon thy bare and beaten sod; I hate the comfort of a shelter'd home, And hie me forth, o'er pathless fields to roam. âO Mary! loss of thee hath fix'd my doom, This world around me is a weary gloom, Dull heavy musings lead my mind astray, I cannot sleep by night nor work by day. Or wealth or pleasure dullest hinds inspire, But cheerless is their toil who nought desire; Let happier friends divide my farmer's stock, Cut down my grain, and shear my little flock; For now my only care on earth will be Here every Sunday morn to visit thee, And in the holy church with heart sincere And humble mind our worthy curate hear; He best can tell, when earthly woes are past, The surest way to meet with thee at last. I'll thus awhile a weary life abide, Till wasting time hath laid me by thy side; For now on earth there is no place for me, Nor peace nor slumber till I rest with thee.â Loud from the lofty spire, with piercing knell, Solemn and awful, toll'd the parish bell, A later hour than rustics deem it meet That churchyard ground be trod by mortal feet. The wailing lover started at the sound, And raised his head and cast his eyes around. The gloomy pile in strengthen'd horror lower'd, Large and majestic every object tower'd; Dun through the gloom, they show'd like forms unknown, And tall and ghastly rose each whiten'd stone; Aloft the dismal screech-owl 'gan to sing, And past him skimm'd the bat with flapping wing. The fears of nature woke within his breast, He left the hallow'd spot of Mary's rest, And sped his way the churchyard wall to gain, Then check'd his fear and stopp'd and would remain. But shadows round a deeper horror wear; A deeper silence falls upon his ear; An awful stillness broods upon the scene, His fluttering heart recoils, he turns again. With hasty steps he measures back the ground, And leaps with summon'd force the churchyard bound; Then home, with shaking limbs and quicken'd breath, His footsteps urges from the place of death. A MOTHER TO HER WAKING INFANT. Now in thy dazzled half-oped eye, Thy curled nose and lip awry, Up-hoisted arms and noddling head, And little chin with crystal spread, Poor helpless thing! what do I see, That I should sing of thee? From thy poor tongue no accents come, Which can but rub thy toothless gum: Small understanding boasts thy face, Thy shapeless limbs nor step nor grace: A few short words thy feats may tell, And yet I love thee well. When wakes the sudden bitter shriek, And redder swells thy little cheek; When rattled keys thy woes beguile, And through thine eyelids gleams the smile, Still for thy weakly self is spent Thy little silly plaint. But when thy friends are in distress, Thou'lt laugh and chuckle ne'ertheless, Nor with kind sympathy be smitten, Though all are sad but thee and kitten; Yet puny varlet that thou art, Thou twitchest at the heart. Thy smooth round cheek so soft and warm; Thy pinky hand and dimpled arm; Thy silken locks that scantly peep, With gold tipp'd ends, where circles deep, Around thy neck in harmless grace, So soft and sleekly hold their place, Might harder hearts with kindness fill, And gain our right goodwill. Each passing clown bestows his blessing, Thy mouth is worn with old wives' kissing; E'en lighter looks the gloomy eye Of surly sense when thou art by; And yet, I think, whoe'er they be, They love thee not like me. Perhaps when time shall add a few Short months to thee, thou'lt love me too; And after that, through life's long way, Become my sure and cheering stay; Wilt care for me and be my hold, When I am weak and old. Thou'lt listen to my lengthen'd tale, And pity me when I am frailâ But see, the sweepy spinning fly Upon the window takes thine eye. Go to thy little senseless play; Thou dost not heed my lay. A CHILD TO HIS SICK GRANDFATHER. Grand-dad, they say you're old and frail, Your stiffen'd legs begin to fail: Your staff, no more my pony now, Supports your body bending low, While back to wall you lean so sad, I'm vex'd to see you, Dad. You used to smile and stroke my head, And tell me how good children did; But now, I wot not how it be, You take me seldom on your knee: Yet ne'ertheless I am right glad, To sit beside you, Dad. How lank and thin your beard hangs down! Scant are the white hairs on your crown: How wan and hollow are your cheeks! Your brow is cross'd with many streaks; But yet although his strength be fled, I love my own old Dad. The housewives round their potions brew, And gossips come to ask for you; And for your weal each neighbour cares; And good men kneel and say their prayers; And every body looks so sad, When you are ailing, Dad. You will not die and leave us, then? Rouse up and be our Dad again. When you are quiet and laid in bed, We'll doff our shoes and softly tread; And when you wake we'll still be near, To fill old Dad his cheer. When through the house you change your stand, I'll lead you kindly by the hand: When dinner's set I'll with you bide, And aye be serving by your side; And when the weary fire burns blue, I'll sit and talk with you. I have a tale both long and good, About a partlet and her brood, And greedy cunning fox that stole By dead of midnight through a hole, Which slily to the hen-roost led,â You love a story, Dad? And then I have a wondrous tale Of men all clad in coats of mail, With glittering swords,âyou nod,âI think Your heavy eyes begin to wink;â Down on your bosom sinks your head:â You do not hear me, Dad. THUNDER Spirit of strength! to whom in wrath 'tis given, To mar the earth and shake its vasty dome, Behold the sombre robes whose gathering folds Thy secret majesty conceal. Their skirts Spread on mid air move slow and silently, O'er noon-day's beam thy sultry shroud is cast, Advancing clouds from every point of heaven, Like hosts of gathering foes in pitchy volumes, Grandly dilated, clothe the fields of air, And brood aloft o'er the empurpled earth. Spirit of strength! it is thy awful hour; The wind of every hill is laid to rest, And far o'er sea and land deep silence reigns. Wild creatures of the forest homeward hie, And in their dens with fear unwonted cower; Pride in the lordly palace is put down, While in his humble cot the poor man sits With all his family round him hush'd and still, In awful expectation. On his way The traveller stands aghast and looks to heaven. On the horizon's verge thy lightning gleams, And the first utterance of thy deep voice Is heard in reverence and holy fear. From nearer clouds bright burst more vivid gleams, As instantly in closing darkness lost; Pale sheeted flashes cross the wide expanse, While over boggy moor, or swampy plain, A streaming cataract of flame appears, To meet a nether fire from earth cast up, Commingling terribly; appalling gloom Succeeds, and lo! the rifted centre pours A general blaze, and from the war of clouds, Red, writhing, falls the embodied bolt of heaven. Then swells the rolling peal, full, deep'ning, grand, And in its strength lifts the tremendous roar, With mingled discord, rattling, hissing, growling: Crashing like rocky fragments downward hurl'd, Like the upbreaking of a ruin'd world, In awful majesty the explosion bursts Wide and astounding o'er the trembling land. Mountain, and cliff, repeat the dread turmoil, And all, to man's distinctive senses known, Is lost in the immensity of sound. Peal after peal succeeds with waning strength, And hush'd and deep each solemn pause between. Upon the lofty mountain's side The kindled forest blazes wide; Huge fragments of the rugged steep Are tumbled to the lashing deep; Firm rooted in his cloven rock, Crashing falls the stubborn oak. The lightning keen in wasteful ire Darts fiercely on the pointed spire, Rending in twain the iron-knit stone, And stately towers to earth are thrown. No human strength may brave the storm, Nor shelter screen the shrinking form, Nor castle wall its fury stay, Nor massy gate impede its way: It visits those of low estate, It shakes the dwellings of the great, It looks athwart the vaulted tomb, And glares upon the prison's gloom. Then dungeons black in unknown light Flash hideous on the wretches' sight, And strangely groans the downward cell, Where silence deep is wont to dwell. Now eyes, to heaven up-cast, adore, Knees bend that never bent before, The stoutest hearts begin to fail, And many a manly face is pale; Benumbing fear awhile up-binds The palsied action of their minds, Till waked to dreadful sense they lift their eyes, And round the stricken corse shrill shrieks of horror rise. Now rattling hailstones, bounding as they fall To earth, spread motley winter o'er the plain; Receding peals sound fainter on the ear, And roll their distant grumbling far away: The lightning doth in paler flashes gleam, And through the rent cloud, silver'd with his rays, The sun on all this wild affray looks down, As, high enthroned above all mortal ken, A higher Power beholds the strife of men. THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER. Braced in the sinewy vigour of thy breed, In pride of generous strength, thou stately steed; Thy broad chest to the battle's front is given, Thy mane fair floating to the winds of heaven; Thy stamping hoofs the flinty pebbles break; Graceful the rising of thine arched neck; Thy bridle-bits white flakes of foam enlock; From thy moved nostrils bursts the curling smoke; Thy kindling eye-balls brave the glaring south, And dreadful is the thunder of thy mouth: Whilst low to earth thy curving haunches bend, Thy sweepy tail involved in clouds of sand, Erect in air thou rearst thy front of pride, And ringst the plated harness on thy side! But lo! what creature, goodly to the sight, Dares thus bestride thee, chafing in thy might; Of portly stature and determined mien, Whose dark eye dwells beneath a brow serene, And forward looks unmoved to scenes of death, Who smiling, gently strokes thee in thy wrath: Whose right hand doth its flashing falchion wield? A British soldier girded for the field! FRAGMENT OF A POEM Gloomy and still was the broad solemn deep, Whose rolling tides for twice a hundred years Had lash'd the rugged walls of Tora's Towers, The strong abode of Curdmore's haughty kings. Its frowning battlements o'erhung the sea, Where in the fair serene of summer days, Each answering Tower a nether heaven did meet, And cast its pictured shadow on the waves. But now, no mild blue sky in gentle grandeur Did lend its azure covering to the main, Softening the most majestic work of nature, Nor even a sunbeam through the rifted cloud Glanced on the distant wave. Dull heavy clouds hung in the lower air, Misty and shapeless, like the humid chaos, Ere God divided it, and called it water. The creatures of the deep forgot their prey, Leaving the upper waves to seek the bottom; The flocking sea-fowl homeward bent their flight, In dusky bands, to cavern'd rock or cliff. A deadly calm reign'd in the stately woods, That hung aloft upon the hardy shore; The mingled music of the forest ceased Before the day had run its wonted term, Yet birds of night forgot their twilight song, And every creature, whether fierce or tame, Skulk'd in its hole, seized with unwonted fear. Nor was that creature styled the lord of earth Without his fear; that secret worst of fears, The mind unknowing what it has to dread. Fenced in the seeming safety of his home, Man's sometime-haughty spirit sank within him, And dark uncertainty of ill unseen Increased the sombre gloom of Tora's Halls. The sullen watch did lean upon their arms, With quicken'd breath half-check'd and listening ear, In expectation of some unknown thing. Each smother'd in his breast his untold fears And wish'd within himself the hours might speed, But that the night with tenfold horror came, To close the frightful day. No cheerful converse graced the evening board, Slow went the goblet round, each face was grave: And ere the first dark watch fulfill'd its term, All were retired to rest in Tora's Halls. Sleep came, and closed full many a weary eye, But not that gentle kindly visitor, That ofttimes bringeth to the poor man's cot More wealth than e'er enjoy'd his haughty lord; Or to the couch of the dejected lover Brings true love-knots, and kind remembrances, And cheering glances, making him by night The favour'd man he fain would be by day; Nor yet that haggard tyrant of the night, Who comes ofttimes to shake the ill man's bed, Tearing him from his heaps of silk and down To hang his quivering carcass o'er the gulf, Or through the air by foul fiends goaded on Bears him with dizzy, furious speed along; But she, stiff shrouded in her blackest weed, And swathed with leaden bands, awful and still, Who by the couch of the condemned wretch, Harass'd and spent, before the morning breaks, Whose setting sun he never shall behold, Oft takes her stand, and scarce is known from death. But still the red lamp, pendent from the roof, Did cast its trembling and unjoyous light Athwart the lofty chamber of the king; For he alone felt not her weighty power. A load of cares lay heavy at his heart; His thoughtful eyes were bent upon the ground; And the unsuiting gravity of age Had sadly sober'd o'er his cheek of youth, That newly blush'd beneath a galling crown. Long had his warlike father ruled the land, Whose vengeful bloody sword no scabbard knew. Wild was his fury in the field of battle, And dreadful was his wrath to nations round, But kind and glowing yearn'd his manly heart To the brave hardy sons of his blue hills. He own'd a friend and brother of the field In each broad-chested brawny warrior, Who follow'd to the fight his daring steps. One deed of fame, done by a son of Curdmore, He prized more than the wealth of peaceful realms, And dealt them death and ruin in his love. Unshaped and rude the state, and knew no law, Save that plain sense, which nature gives to all, Of right and wrong within the monarch's breast; And when no storm of passion shook his soul, It was a court of mildest equity. One distant nation only in the field Could meet his boasted arms with equal strength. Impetuous, rushing from their mountains rude, Oft had they striven like two adverse winds, That bursting from their spent and narrow glens, On the wide desert meet,âin wild contention Tossing aloft in air dun clouds of sand, Tearing the blasted herbage from its bed, And bloating the clear face of beauteous heaven With the dissever'd fragments of the earth, Till spent their force, low growling they retire, And for a time within their caverns keep, Gathering new force with which they issue forth To rage and roar again.âSo held they strife. But e'en while Corvan gloried in his might, Death came and laid him low. His spear was hung high in the sombre hall, Whose lofty walls with darkening armour clad Spoke to the valiant of departed heroes, A fellow now to those which rest ungrasp'd, Unburnished, and know no master's hand. A hardy people, scatter'd o'er the hills, And wild uncultivated plains of Curdmore, Depending more upon to-morrow's chace, Than on the scanty produce of their fields, Where the proud warrior, as debased by toil, Throws down unwillingly his boasted weapons, To mar the mossy earth with his rude tillage, Bedding his dwarfish grain in tracks less deep Than he would plough the bosom of a foe; A people rude but generous now look'd up, With wistful and expecting eyes, to Allener, The son of their beloved, their only hope. The general burthen, though but new to care, Was laid on him. His heart within him whisper'd That he was left in rough and perilous times, Like elder brother of a needy race, To watch and care for all, and it was thoughtful; Sombre and thoughtful as unjoyous age. But never had he felt his mind so dark, As in this heavy and mysterious hour. With drooping head and arms cross'd o'er his breast, His spirit all collected in itself, As it had ceased to animate the body, He sat, when, like pent air from a dank cave, He felt a cold and shivering wind pass o'er him, And from his sinking bosom raised his head. A thick and mazy mist had fill'd the chamber, Through which the feeble lamp its blue flame show'd With a pale moony circlet compass'd round, As when the stars through dank unwholesome air Show through the night their blunted heads, enlarged, Foretelling plagues to some affrighted land. When, lo! a strange light, breaking through the gloom, Struck his astonish'd mind with awe and wonder. It rose before him in a streamy column, As, seen upon the dim benighted ocean, By partial moon-beams through some sever'd cloud, The towering, wan, majestic waterspout Delights and awes the wondering mariner. Soul-awed within himself shrank Curdmore's king; Thick beat his fluttering heart against his breast, As towards him the moving light approach'd, While opening by degrees its beamy sides A mighty phantom show'd his awful form, Gigantic, far above the sons of men. A robe of watery blue in wreathy folds Did lightly float o'er his majestic limbs: Firm in their strength more than was ever pictured Of fabled heroes in their fields of war. One hand was wide outstretch'd in threaten'd act, As if to draw down vengeance from the skies; The other, spread upon his ample breast, Seem'd to betoken what restrain'd its fellow. Thus far to mortal eye he stood reveal'd, But misty vapour shrouded all above, Save that a ruddy glow did oft break through With hasty flash, according with the vehemence And agitation of the form beneath, Speaking the terrors of that countenance The friendly darkness veil'd. Commotions strange disturb'd the heaving earth. A hollow muffled rumbling from beneath Roll'd deeply in its dark and secret course. The castle trembled on its rocky base; And loosen'd fragments from the nodding towers Fell on the flinty ground with hideous crash. The bursting gates against the portal rang, And windows clatter'd in their trembling walls; While as the phantom trode, far echoing loud, The smitten pavement gave a fearful sound. He stopp'd, the trembling walls their motions ceased, The earth was still; he raised his awful voice. âThou creature, set o'er creatures like thyself, To bear the rule for an appointed season, Bethink thee well, and commune with thy heart. If one man's blood can mark the unblest front, And visit with extreme of inward pangs The dark breast of the secret murderer, Canst thou have strength all singly in thyself To bear the blood of thousands on thy head, And wrongs which cry to heaven and shall be heard? Kings to the slaughter lead their people forth, And home return again with thinned bands, Bearing to every house its share of mourning, Whilst high in air they hang their trophied spoils, And call themselves the heroes of the earth. âThy race is stain'd with blood: such were thy fathers: But they are pass'd away and have their place, And thou still breathest in thy weeds of clay; Therefore to thee their doom is veil'd in night. Yet mayst thou be assured, that mighty Power Who gave to thee thy form of breathing flesh, Of such like creatures as thyself endow'd, Although innumerable on this earth, Doth knowledge take, and careth for the least, And will prepare His vengeance for the man Whose wasteful pride uproots what he hath sown. And now he sets two paths before thy choice, Which are permitted thee: even thou thyself Mayst fix thy doom,âa doom which cannot change. Wilt thou draw out securely on thy throne A life of such content and happiness As thy wild country and rude people yield, Laying thee late to rest in peaceful age, Where thy forefathers sleep; thy name respected, Thy children after thee to fill thy seat? Or wilt thou, as thy secret thoughts incline, Across the untried deep conduct thy bands, Attack the foe on their unguarded coast, O'ercome their strength at little cost of blood, And raise thy trophies on a distant shore, Where none of all thy race have footing gain'd,â Gaining for Curdmore wealth, and power, and fame, But not that better gain, content and happiness? Wealth, power, renown, thou mayst for Curdmore earn, But mayst not live to see her rising state: For far from hence, upon that hostile shore, A sepulchre which owns no kindred bone, Gapes to receive thee in the pride of youth. This is the will of heaven: then choose thy fate; Weak son of earth, I leave thee to thy troubles; A little while shall make us more alike, A spirit shalt thou be when next we meet.â It vanish'd. Black mist thicken'd where it stood, A hollow sounding wind rush'd through the chamber, And rent in twain the deep embodied darkness Which, curling round in many a pitchy volume, On either side, did slowly roll away, Like two huge waves of death. And now the waving banners of the castle In early breath of morn began to play, And faintly through the lofty windows look'd The doubtful grey-light on the silent chambers. Sleep's deadly heaviness fled with the night, And lighter airy fancies of the dawn Confusedly floated in the half-waked mind, Till roused with fuller beams of powerful light, Up sprang the dreamers from their easy beds, And saw with a relieved and thankful heart The fair blue sky, the uncapp'd distant hills, The woods, and streams, and valleys brightening gladly In the blest light of heaven. But neither hill, nor vale, nor wood, nor stream, Nor yet the sun high riding in his strength, That beauty gave to all, cheer'd Allener, Who wist not when it rose, nor when it set. Silent but troubled in his lofty chamber Two days he sat and shunn'd the searching eyes, The sidelong looks of many a friendly chief. Oft in his downcast eye the round tear hung, Whilst by his side he clench'd his trembling hand, As if to rouse the ardour of his soul. His seat beneath him shook,âhigh heaved his breast, And burst the bracings of its tighten'd vestment. The changing passions of his troubled soul Pass'd with dark speed across his varied face; Each passing shadow follow'd by a brother, Like clouds across the moon in a wild storm: So warr'd his doubtful mind, till by degrees The storm subsided, calmer thoughts prevail'd; Slow wore the gloom away like morning mist; A gleam of joy spread o'er his lighten'd visage, And from his eye-balls shot that vivid fire Which kindles in the bosoms of the brave, When the loud trumpet calls them forth to battle. âGird on mine armour,â said the rising youth, âI am the son of Corvan!â MISCELLANEOUS POETRY WRITTEN SINCE THE YEAR 1790. LINES ON THE DEATH OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. Thou pleasant noble Bard, of fame far spread, Now art thou gather'd to the mighty dead, And the dark coffin and the girdling mould All that of thee is perishable, hold. Mourners and mutes and weeping friends are gone; The pageant's closed, and thou art left alone; The cover'd treasure of a sacred spot, That in the course of time shall never be forgot. Soon those who loved, admired, and honoured thee, In death's still garner-house will gathered be; And great their number is, who have with pride Look'd in thy manly face, sat by thy side, And heard thy social converse,âwords of cheer, And words of power to charm the listening ear! At death's despotic summons will they come, Each in his turn from many a different home: From town and muirland, cot and mansion warm, The regal palace, and the homely farm. Soldier and lawyer, merchant, priest and peer, The squire, the laird of forty pounds a-year, The crowned monarch and the simple hind, Did all in thee a meet companion find. For thee the peasant's wife her elbow chair, Smiling a weicome, kindly set, and there With fair exchange of story, saw and jest, Thou wast to her a free and pleasant guest; While nature, undisguised, repaid thee well For time so spent. She and her mate could tell Unawed, to such a man, their inmost mind; They claim'd thee as their own, their kin, their kind. From nature's book thou couldst extract a store, More precious than the scholar's classic lore. And how felt he, whose early rhymes had been To perilous inspection given, and seen By one whose brows were graced from every land, With chaplets twined by many a skilful hand? How beat his heart, as with the morning ray, To Abbotsford he took his anxious way, Imagining what shortly he must see, Him in whose presence he so soon will be? And how felt he, thy study's threshold pass'd, When on thy real face his eyes were cast? Thine open brow with glow of fancy heated; Thy purring cat upon the table seated; Thy sleeping hound that hath his easy lair Close on the precincts of his master's chair; The honest welcome of that sudden smile, And outstretch'd hand, misgiving thoughts beguile. But when thy cheerful greeting met his ear, âFie on thee! foolish heart, a man like this to fear!â Thou wast to him, when blush'd the eastern sky, A sage of awful mien and lofty eye; When noon-day heat called forth th' industrious bee, Thou wast the monitor both kind and free; But when the changeful day was at an end, Thou wast his easy cheerful host,âhis friend. When all whose eyes have e'er beheld thy face, Departed are to their long resting-place, Thou wilt exist in all thy magic then, The cherish'd, speaking friend of living men. In torrid climes, in regions cold and bleak, In every land and language wilt thou speak. Within the sick man's curtain'd couch thou'lt dwell; Within the languid prisoner's cheerless cell; Within the seaman's cabin, where the sound Of many leagues of water murmurs round. The buoyant school-boy will forego his play, In secret nook alone with thee to stray; The sober sage wise tomes will cast aside, An hour with theeâa pleasant hour to bide. Men of all nations, of all creeds, all ranks, Will owe to thee an endless meed of thanks, Which more than in thy passing, checker'd day Of mortal life, they will delight to pay. For who shall virtuous sympathies resign, Or feed foul fancies from a page of thine? No, none! thy writings as thy life are pure, And their fair fame and influence will endure. Not so with those where perverse skill pourtrays Distorted, blighting passions; and displays, Wild, maniac, selfish fiends to be admired, As heroes with sublimest ardour fired. Such are, to what thy faithful pen hath traced, With all the shades of varied nature graced, Like grim cartoons, for Flemish looms prepared, To Titian's or Murillo's forms compared; Stately or mean, theirs still are forms of truth, Charming unlearn'd and learnedâage and youth: Not ecstasies express'd in critic phrase, But silent smiles of pleasure speak their praise. When those, who now thy recent death deplore, Lie in the dust, thought of and known no more, As poet and romancer, thy great name Will brightly shine with undiminish'd fame; And future sons of fancy fondly strive To their compatriots works like thine to give. But of the many who on her wide sea Shall boldly spread their sails to follow thee, More as romancers on thy track will gain, Than those who emulate the poet's strain. A tale like Waverley we yet may con, But shall we read a lay like Marmion? And fearlessly I say it, though I know The voice of public favour says not so: For story-telling is an art, I ween, Which hath of old most fascinating been, And will be ever,âstrong in ready power, To combat languor and the present hour; And o'er these common foes will oft prevail, When Homer's theme and Milton's song would fail. But strong in both, there is in sooth no need Against thy left hand for thy right to plead: Think as we list, one truth, alas! is plain, We ne'er shall look upon thy like again. Thy country, bounded by her subject sea, Adds to her fame by giving birth to thee; In distant lands yon fancied group behold, Where busy traders meet in quest of gold; Motley and keen, all gather'd round a youth, Who simply stands unconscious of the truth, Look at him wistfully, and hark, they speakâ The Turk and Jew, Armenian and Greek, Their rapid lips the whisper'd words betrayingâ âHe's from the land of Walter Scott,â they're saying. That Caledonian, too, with more good will They greet as of thy closer kindred still: But who is he, who, standing by their side, Raises his head with quickly-kindled pride, As if he meant to look the others down? Ay; he is from thine own romantic town. Thou art in time's long course a land-mark high, A beacon blazing to the nether sky, To which, as far and wide it shoots its rays, Landsmen and mariners, with wistful gaze, From ship, and shore, and mountain turn their sight, And hail the glorious signal of the night. Oh Dryburgh! often trod by pilgrim feet Shall be thy hallow'd turf; solemn and sweet, Will be the gentle sorrow utter'd there, The whisper'd blessing and the quiet prayer. Flower, herb, or leaf by children yet unborn Will often from thy verdant turf be torn, And kept in dear memorial of the place Where thou art laid with a departed race; Where every thing around, tower, turret, tree, River, and glen, and mountain, wood and lea, And ancient ruin, by the moonlight made More stately with alternate light and shade, Thy once beloved Melrose,âall speak of thee, With mingled voices through the gale of morn, Of evening, noon, and night, most sadly borne, A dirge-like wailing, a mysterious moan, That sadly seems to utter âHe is gone!â To God's forgiving mercy and his loveâ To fellowship with blessed souls aboveâ Bright hosts redeem'd by Him whose voice of hope Revealed th' immortal spirit's boundless scopeâ We leave thee, though within its narrow cell, Thy honour'd dust must for a season dwellâ Our friend, our bard, our brother,âfare thee well! Hampstead, November, 1832. EPILOGUE TO THE THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION AT STRAWBERRY HILL. WRITTEN BY JOANNA BAILLIE, AND SPOKEN BY THE HON. ANNE S. DAMER, NOVEMBER, 1800. While fogs along the Thames' damp margin creep, And cold winds through his leafless willows sweep; While fairy elves, whose summer sport had been To foot it lightly on the moonlight green, Now, hooded close, in many a cowering form, Troop with the surly spirits of the storm; While by the blazing fire, with saddled nose, The sage turns o'er his leaves of tedious prose, And o'er their new-dealt cards, with eager eye, Good dowagers exult, or inly sigh, And blooming maids from silken work-bags pour (Like tangled sea-weed on the vexed shore) Of patchwork, netting, fringe, a strange and motley store; While all, attempting many a different mode, Would from their shoulders hitch time's heavy load, This is our choice, in comic sock bedight, To wrestle with a long November night.â âIn comic sock!â methinks indignant cries Some grave fastidious friend with angry eyes, Scowling severe, âNo more the phrase abuse; So shod, indeed there had been some excuse; But in these walls, a once well-known retreat, Where taste and learning kept a favourite seat, Where Gothic arches with a solemn shade Should o'er the thoughtful mind their influence spread; Where pictures, vases, busts, and precious things Still speak of sages, poets, heroes, kings, On which the stranger looks with pensive gaze, And thinks upon the worth of other days: Like foolish children, in their mimic play, Confined at grandame's in a rainy day, With paltry farce and all its bastard train, Grotesque and broad, such precincts to profane! It is a shame!âBut no, I will not speak, I feel the blood rise mantling to my cheek.â Indeed, wise sir!â But he who o'er our heads those arches bent, And stored these relies dear to sentiment, More mild than you with grave pedantic pride, Would not have ranged him on your surly side. But now to you, who on our frolic scene, Have look'd well pleased, and gentle critics been; Nor would our homely humour proudly spurn, To you the good, the gay, the fair, I turn, And thank you all. If here our feeble powers Have lightly wing'd for you some wintry hours; Should these remember'd scenes in fancy live, And to some future minutes pleasure give, To right good end we've worn our mumming guise, And we're repaid and happyâay, and wise. Who says we are not, on his sombre birth Gay fancy smiled not, nor heart-light'ning mirth: Home let him hie to his unsocial rest, And heavy sit the nightmare on his breast! THE BANISHED MAN. ON A DISTANT VIEW OF HIS COUNTRY, WHICH HE IS QUITTING FOR EVER. Dear distant land, whose mountains blue Still bound this wild and watery view,â Dear distant land, where fate has thrown All that my heart delights to own! Blest be yon gleam of partial light, Which gives thee to my parting sight! Those well-known cliffs, whose shadows throw Soft coolness o'er the beach below, Where I so oft, a happy child, Picking or shell or weed, beguiled Light reckless hours, that pass'd away, Like night-sparks on the briny spray,â Dear pleasant shore, thy sandy bed, These feet unblest no more shall tread! Still thy rich vales with autumn's store, And cheerful hamlets mottled o'er; Thy up-land peaks whose stately forms Are mantled oft in gathering storms; Thy blue streams widening on their way, Thy broad lakes gleaming to the day; Thy smoking towns, whose towers of war And dusky spires are seen afar, Thy children's boastful pride will raise, And fix the admiring stranger's gaze,â But now, for ever lost to me, These eyes unblest no more shall see. Thy wild pipe, touch'd with rustic hands, Thy reapers' song from merry bands, Thy boatman's call and dashing oar, Thy falling torrent's deafening roar, Thy busy city's humming sound, With all its sweet bells chiming round, Far, on a strange and cheerless shore, These ears unblest shall hear no more. Happy is he, beyond all gain, Who holds in thee his free domain, And roves with careless feet at will O'er his paternal mead and hill, And stores the fruit his harvests yield From his own orchard and his field! Happy is he who leads at dawn His harness'd steers across thy lawn! Yea, happy he, bent down with toil, Whose glistening brow bedews thy soil! How gently heaves the evening sea, As all things homeward tend to thee! Borne lightly on the gentle gale, Now homeward points each little sail; Far, screaming from their airy height, The sea-fowl homeward take their flight; The floating plank and spreading weed. Upon the setting current speed; The light cloud passes on the wind, While I alone am left behind. Ah, woe is me! where shall I stray, And whither bend my reckless way? A waste of world before me lies, But in the thought my spirit dies. There is no home nor joy for me, My native land, removed from thee. For me the sun of heaven doth shine Upon no hills, no plains, but thine; For me the voice of kindness sounds Only within thy cheerful bounds. Rise, surgy deep; ye wild winds, blow, And whelm my bark these waves below! Then bear me to my native land, A breathless corse upon her strand: Some hand, in pity of the dead, Will lay her greensward on my head, And there for ever let me rest, As sleeps the froward child, still'd on his mother's breast! TO A CHILD. Whose imp art thou, with dimpled cheek, And curly pate, and merry eye, And arm and shoulder round and sleek, And soft and fair?âthou urchin sly! What boots it who with sweet caresses First call'd thee his,âor squire or hind? Since thou in every wight that passes, Dost now a friendly play-mate find. Thy downcast glances, grave, but cunning, As fringed eye-lids rise and fall; Thy shyness, swiftly from me running, Is infantine coquetry all. But far a-field thou hast not flown; With mocks and threats, half lisp'd, half spoken, I feel thee pulling at my gown, Of right good will thy simple token. And thou must laugh and wrestle too, A mimic warfare with me waging; To make, as wily lovers do, Thy after-kindness more engaging. The wilding rose, sweet as thyself, And new-cropt daisies are thy treasure: I'd gladly part with worldly pelf To taste again thy youthful pleasure. But yet, for all thy merry look, Thy frisks and wiles, the time is coming, When thou shalt sit in cheerless nook, The weary spell or horn-book thumbing. Well; let it be!âthrough weal and wo, Thou knowst not now thy future range; Life is a motley, shifting show, And thou a thing of hope and change! SONG (TO THE SCOTCH AIR OF âMY NANNY O.â) Wi' lang-legg'd Tam the broose I tried, Though best o' foot, what wan he O? The first kiss of the blowzy bride, But I the heart of Nanny O. Like swallow wheeling round her tower, Like rock-bird round her cranny O, Sinsyne I hover near her bower, And list and look for Nanny O. I'm nearly wild, I'm nearly daft, Wad fain be douce, but canna' O; There's ne'er a laird of muir or craft, Sae blithe as I wi' Nanny O. She's sweet, she's young, she's fair, she's good, The brightest maid of many O, Though a' the world our love withstood, I'd woo and win my Nanny O. Her angry mither scaulds sae loud, And darkly glooms her granny O; But think they he can e'er be cow'd, Wha loves and lives for Nanny O? The spae-wife on my loof that blink't Is but a leeing ranny O, For weel kens she my fate is link't In spite of a' to Nanny O. LONDON. It is a goodly sight through the clear air, From Hampstead's heathy height to see at once England's vast capital in fair expanse, Towers, belfries, lengthen'd streets, and structures fair. St. Paul's high dome amidst the vassal bands Of neighb'ring spires, a regal chieftain stands, And over fields of ridgy roofs appear, With distance softly tinted, side by side, In kindred grace, like twain of sisters dear, The Towers of Westminster, her Abbey's pride; While, far beyond, the hills of Surrey shine Through thin soft haze, and show their wavy line. View'd thus, a goodly sight! but when survey'd Through denser air when moisten'd winds prevail, In her grand panoply of smoke array'd, While clouds aloft in heavy volumes sail, She is sublime.âShe seems a curtain'd gloom Connecting heaven and earth,âa threat'ning sign of doom. With more than natural height, rear'd in the sky 'Tis then St. Paul's arrests the wondering eye; The lower parts in swathing mist conceal'd, The higher through some half spent shower reveal'd, So far from earth removed, that well, I trow, Did not its form man's artful structure show, It might some lofty alpine peak be deem'd, The eagle's haunt, with cave and crevice seam'd. Stretch'd wide on either hand, a rugged screen, In lurid dimness, nearer streets are seen Like shoreward billows of a troubled main, Arrested in their rage. Through drizzly rain, Cataracts of tawny sheen pour from the skies, Of furnace smoke black curling columns rise, And many tinted vapours, slowly pass O'er the wide draping of that pictured mass. So shows by day this grand imperial town, And, when o'er all the night's black stole is thrown, The distant traveller doth with wonder mark Her luminous canopy athwart the dark, Cast up, from myriads of lamps that shine Along her streets in many a starry line:â He wondering looks from his yet distant road, And thinks the northern streamers are abroad. âWhat hollow sound is that?â approaching near, The roar of many wheels breaks on his ear. It is the flood of human life in motion! It is the voice of a tempestuous ocean! With sad but pleasing awe his soul is fill'd, Scarce heaves his breast, and all within is still'd, As many thoughts and feelings cross his mind,â Thoughts, mingled, melancholy, undefined, Of restless, reckless man, and years gone by, And Time fast wending to Eternity. LINES ON THE DEATH OF WILLIAM SOTHEBY, ESQ. Learning and fancy were combined To stimulate his manly mind; Open, generous, and acute, Steady of purpose, in pursuit Ardent and hopeful; all the while In child-like ignorance of guile. There are who say that envy lurks conceal'd Where genius strives, by slightest traits reveal'd, A truth, if truth it be, by him forgot, He turn'd his eyes away and saw it not. Success in others, frank and free, He hail'd with words of friendly glee. Praise given to them he could not feel Did aught from his own portion steal; And when offence, design'd and rude, Did on his peaceful path obtrude, He soon forgave the paltry pain, Nor could resentment in his breast retain. His was the charity of right goodwill, That loves, confides, believes and thinks no ill. He, by his Saviour's noble precepts led, Still follow'd what was right with heart and head. Religion did with lofty honour dwell Within his bosom's sacred cell. But said I learning did in him agree With fancy, union rare! how could it be? His eighteenth year beheld him fondly cheering His warlike steed and on its back careering; A gay dragoon with spur on heel, And brandish'd blade of flashing steel; With wealth at will, the world before him, To go where whim or fashion bore him; No friendly tutor by his side, His academic course to guide; No classic honours to invite, No emulation to excite. But, in default of these, his soul With native fire supplied the whole; And neither Hall nor College claim Honour from him, whose honour'd name Shall henceforth with the highest stand, The most efficient scholars of our land. To him what meed of thanks th' unlearned owe! And e'en the learned, who best his merits know. With Homer, Virgil, Wieland, all converse Like true compatriots in his pliant verse. Pliant, but elevated, graceful, bold, And worthy of the Bards of old. Nor will we thanklessly peruse The beauties of his native muse, Where lofty thoughts and feelings sweet, And moral truths commingling meet, Where fancy spreads her absent scene, The flowery mead, the forest green; The plains, the mountain peaks, the fanes sublime, The ruins long revered of Italy's fair clime. Yea, thanks be his, heart-given and kind, For all his pen has left behind! Though bitters in his cup were mix'd, And in his heart sharp arrows fix'd, The current of his life ran clear; With virtuous love and duteous children blest, He journey'd onward to the Christian's rest, And happy was his long career. Social and joyous to the end, Around him gather'd many a friend, Whose minds his dear remembrance hold, Though seventy years and more His head had silver'd o'er, As one who ne'er was old. Rejoicing in his well-earn'd fame, They oft repeat his honour'd name, And as their thoughts on all his virtues dwell, With sorrow, cheer'd and sweet, bid him a last farewell. VERSES TO OUR OWN FLOWERY KIRTLED SPRING. Welcome, sweet time of buds and bloom, renewing The earliest objects of delight, and wooing The notice of the grateful heart! for then Long hidden, beauteous friends are seen again; From the cleft soil, like babes from cradle peeping, At the glad light, where soundly they've been sleeping; Like chickens in their downy coats, just freeing From the chipp'd shell, their new-found active being; Like spotted butterfly, its wings up-rearing, Half from the bursting chrysalis appearing. Sweet season, so bedight, so gay, so kind, Right welcome to the sight and to the mind! Now many a âthing that pretty isâ delays The wanderer's steps beneath the sun's soft rays; Gay daffodils, bent o'er the watery gleam, Doubling their flicker'd image in the stream; The woody nook where bells of brighter blue Have clothed the ground in heaven's ethereal hue; The lane's high sloping bank, where pale primrose With hundreds of its gentle kindred blows; And speckled daisies that on uplands bare Their round eyes opening, scatter gladness there. Man looks on Nature with a grateful smile, And thinks of Nature's bounteous Lord the while. Now urchins range the brake in joyous bands, With new-cull'd nosegays in their dimpled hands. The cottage maid her household task-work cheats In mead or glen to pick the choicest sweets, With skilful care preserved for Sunday morn, Her bosom's simple kerchief to adorn. And e'en the beldame, as with sober tread, She takes her sunning in the grassy mead, Stoops down with eager look and finds, well pleased, Such herbs, as in a chest or Bible squeezed, In former days were deem'd, by folks of sense, A fragrant wholesome virtue to dispense, And oft on rafter'd roof, in bunches strung, With other winter stores were duly hung. But not alone in simple scenes like these, Thy beauteous offspring our soothed senses please; I' the city's busy streets, by rich men's doors, On whose white steps the flower-girl sets her stores, In wicker basket group'd to lure the sight, They stop and tempt full many a wistful wight. Flowers though they be by artful culture bred, Upon the suburb seedsman's crowded bed, By fetid manure cherish'd, gorgeous, bright, Like civic madams dress'd for festive night, Anemonies of crimson, purple, yellow, And tulips streak'd with colours rich and mellow, Brown wallflowers and jonquils of golden glare, In dapper posies tied like shop-man's ware, Yet still they whisper something to the heart, Which feelings kind and gentle thoughts impart. Gay sight! that oft a touch of pleasure gives E'en to the saddest, rudest soul that livesâ Gay sight! the passing carman grins thereat, And sticks a purchased posie in his hat, And cracks his whip and treads the rugged streets With waggish air, and jokes with all he meets: The sickly child from nursery window spies The tempting show and for a nosegay cries, Which placed in china mug, by linnet's cage, Will for a time his listless mind engage: The dame precise moves at the flower-girl's cry, Laying her patch-work or her netting by, And from the parlour window casts her eye, Then sends across the way her tiny maid; And presently on mantelpiece display'd, Between fair ornaments of china ware, Small busts and lacker'd parrots station'd there, Tulips, anemonies, and wallflowers shine, And strangely with their new compeers combine Each visitor with wonder to excite, Who looks and smiles and lauds the motley sight: That even to the prison's wretched thrall, Those simple gems of nature will recall. What soothes the sadness of his dreary state, Yon narrow windows, through whose iron grate A squalid countenance is dimly traced, Gazing on flowers in broken pitcher placed Upon the sooty sill, and withering there, Sad emblems of himself! most piteously declare. Of what in gentle lady's curtain'd room, On storied stands and gilded tripods bloom, The richest, rarest flowers of every clime, Whose learned names suit not my simple rhyme, I speak not! lovely as they are, we find They visit more the senses than the mind. Their nurture comes not from the clouds of heaven, But from a painted watering-pot is given; And, in return for daily care, with faint And sickly sweetness hall and chamber taint. I will not speak of those; we feel and see They have no kindred, our own Spring, with thee! Welcome, sweet season! though with rapid pace Thy course is run, and we can scarcely grace Thy joyous coming with a grateful cheer, Ere loose-leaved flowers and leaflets shrunk and sere, And flaccid bending stems, sad bodings! tell We soon must bid our fleeting friend farewell. LINES TO A PARROT. In these our days of sentiment When youthful poets all lament Some dear lost joy, some cruel maid; Old friendship changed and faith betray'd; The world's cold frown and every ill That tender hearts with anguish fill; Loathing this world and all its folly, In lays most musical and melancholy,â Touching a low and homely string, May poet of a Parrot sing With dignity uninjured? say!â No; but a simple rhymester may. Well then, I see thee calm and sage, Perch'd on the summit of thy cage, With broad, hook'd beak, and plumage green, Changing to azure in the light, Gay pinions tipp'd with scarlet bright And, strong for mischief, use or play, Thick talons, crisp'd with silver gray,â A gallant bird, I ween! What courtly dame, for ball-room drestâ What garter'd lord in silken vestâ On wedding morn what country bride With groom bedizen'd by her sideâ What youngsters in their fair-day gear, Did ever half so fine appear? Alas! at ball, or church, or fair, Were ne'er assembled visions rare Of moving creatures all so gay As in thy native woods, where day In blazing torrid brightness play'd Through checker'd boughs, and gently made A ceaseless morris-dance of sheen and shade! In those blest woods, removed from man, Thy early being first began, 'Mid gay compeers, who, blest as thou, Hopp'd busily from bough to bough, Robbing each loaded branch at pleasure Of berries, buds, and kernel'd treasure. Then rose aloft with outspread wing, Then stoop'd on flexile twig to swing, Then coursed and circled through the air, Mate chasing mate, full many a pair. It would have set one's heart a-dancing To've seen their varied feathers glancing, And thought how many happy things Creative Goodness into being brings. But now how changed! it is thy doom Within a wall'd and window'd room To hold thy home, and (all forgot The traces of thy former lot), Clutching the wires with progress slow, Still round and round thy cage to go; Or cross the carpet:âalter'd case! This now is all thy daily travel's space. Yet here thou art a cherish'd droll, Known by the name of Pretty Poll; Oft fed by lady's gentle hand With sops and sugar at command, And sometimes too a nut or cherry, Which in thy claws to beak and eye Thou seemst to raise right daintily, Turning it oft, as if thou still Wert scanning it with cautious skill, Provoking urchins near to laughter loud and merry. See, gather'd round, a rosy band, With eager upcast eyes they stand, Marking thy motions and withal Delighting on thy name to call; And hear, like human speech, reply Come from thy beak most curiously. They shout, they mow, they grin, they giggle, Clap hands, hoist arms, and shoulders wriggle; O here, well may we say or sing, That learning is a charming thing! For thou, 'neath thy wire-woven dome, A learned creature hast become; And hast, by dint of oft repeating, Got words by rote, the vulgar cheating, Which, once in ten times well applied, Are to the skies with praises cried. So letter'd dunces oft impose On simple fools their studied prose. Ay; o'er thy round though unwigg'd head, Full many a circling year has sped, Since thou kept terms within thy college, From many tutors, short and tall, In braid or bonnet, cap or caul, Imbibing wondrous stores of seeming knowledge. And rarely Bachelor of Arts Or Master (dare we say it?) imparts To others such undoubted pleasure From all his stores of classic treasure: And ladies sage, whose learned saws To cognoscenti friends give laws, Rarely, I trow, can so excite A listening circle with delight, And rarely their acquirements shine Through such a lengthen'd course as thine. The grannams of this group so gay, Who round thee now their homage pay, Belike have in such youthful glee With admiration gazed on thee; And yet no wrinkled line betrays The long course of thy lengthen'd days. Thy bark of life has kept afloat As on a shoreless sea, where not Or change or progress may be traced; Time hath with thee been leaden-paced. But ah! proud beauty, on whose head Some three-score years no blight have shed, Untoward days will come at length, When thou, of spirit reft and strength, Wilt mope and pine, year after year, Which all one moulting-time appear, And this bright plumage, dull and rusty, Will seem neglected, shrunk and dusty, And scarce a feather's rugged stump Be left to grace thy fretted rump. Mew'd in a corner of thy home, Having but little heart to roam, Thou'lt wink and peerâa wayward elf, And croon and clutter to thyself, Screaming at visitors with spite, And opening wide thy beak to bite. Yet in old age still wilt thou find Some constant friend thy wants to mind, Whose voice thou'lt know, whose hand thou'lt seek, Turning to it thy feather'd cheek; Grateful to her, though cross and froward To all beside, and it will go hard But she will love thee, e'en when life's last goal Thou'st reach'd, and call thee still her Pretty Poll. Now from these lines, young friends, I know A lesson might be drawn to show, How, like our bird, on life's vain stage, Pass human childhood, prime, and age: But conn'd comparisons, I doubt, Might put your patience to the rout, And all my pains small thanks receive; So this to wiser folks I leave. LINES TO A TEAPOT. On thy carved sides, where many a vivid dye In easy progress leads the wandering eye, A distant nation's manners we behold, To the quick fancy whimsically told. The small-eyed beauty and her Mandarin, Who o'er the rail of garden arbour lean, In listless ease; and rocks of arid brown, On whose sharp crags, in gay profusion blown, The ample loose-leaved rose appears to grace The skilful culture of the wondrous place; The little verdant plat, where with his mate The golden pheasant holds his gorgeous state, With gaily crested pate and twisted neck, Turn'd jauntily his glossy wings to peck; The smooth-streak'd water of a paly gray, O'er which the checker'd bridge lends ready way, While, by its margin moor'd, the little boat Doth with its oars and netted awning float; A scene present all soft delights to take in, A paradise for grave Grandee of Pekin. With straight small spout, that from thy body fair Diverges with a smart vivacious air, And round, arch'd handle with gold tracery bound, And dome-shaped lid with bud or button crown'd, Thou standst complete, fair subject of my rhymes, A goodly vessel of the olden times! But far less pleasure yields this fair display Than that enjoy'd upon thy natal day, When round the potter's wheel their chins upraising, An urchin group in silent wonder gazing, Stood and beheld, as, touch'd with magic skill, The whirling clay was fashion'd to his will,â Saw mazy motion stopp'd, and then the toy Complete before their eyes, and grinn'd for joy; Clapping their naked sides with blythe halloo, And curtail'd words of praise, like ting, tung, too! The brown-skinn'd artist, with his unclothed waist And girded loins, who, slow and patient, traced, Beneath his humble shed, this fair array Of pictured forms upon thy surface gay, I will not stop in fancy's sight to place, But speed me on my way with quicken'd pace. Pack'd in a chest with others of thy kind, The sport of waves and every shifting wind, The Ocean thou hast cross'd, and thou mayst claim The passing of the Line to swell thy fame, With as good observation of the thing As some of those who in a hammock swing. And now thou'rt seen in Britain's polish'd land, Held up to public view in waving hand Of boastful auctioneer, whilst dames of pride In morning farthingals, scarce two yards wide, With collar'd lap-dogs snarling in their arms, Contend in rival keenness for thy charms. And certes well they might, for there they found thee With all thy train of vassal cups around thee, A prize which thoughts by day, and dreams by night, Could dwell on for a week with fresh delight. Our pleased imagination now pourtrays The glory of thy high official days, When thou on board of rich japan wast set, Round whose supporting table gaily met At close of eve, the young, the learn'd, the fair, And e'en philosophy and wit were there. 'Midst basons, cream-pots, cups and saucers small, Thou stoodst the ruling chieftain of them all; And e'en the kettle of Potosi's ore, Whose ample cell supplied thy liquid store, Beneath whose base the sapphire flame was burning, Above whose lid the wreathy smoke was turning, Though richly chased and burnish'd it might be, Was yet, confess'd, subordinate to thee. But O! when beauty's hand thy weight sustain'd, The climax of thy glory was attain'd! Back from her elevated elbow fell Its three-tired ruffle, and display'd the swell And gentle rounding of her lily arm, The eyes of wistful sage or beau to charmâ A sight at other times but dimly seen Through veiling folds of point or colberteen. With pleasing toil, red glow'd her dimpled cheek, Bright glanced her eyes beneath her forehead sleek, And as she pour'd the beverage, through the room Was spread its fleeting, delicate perfume. Then did bright wit and cheerful fancy play With all the passing topics of the day. So delicate, so varied, and so free Was the heart's pastime, then inspired by thee, That goblet, bowl, or flask could boast no power Of high excitement, in their reigning hour, Compared to thine;âred wildfire of the fen, To summer moonshine of some fairy glen. But now the honours of thy course are past, For what of earthly happiness may last! Although in modern drawing-room, a board May fragrant tea from menial hands afford, Which, pour'd in dull obscurity hath been, From pot of vulgar ware, in nook unseen, And pass'd in hasty rounds our eyes before, Thou in thy graceful state art seen no more. And what the changeful fleeting crowd, who sip The unhonour'd beverage with contemptuous lip, Enjoy amidst the tangled, giddy maze, Their languid eyeâtheir listless air betrays. What though at times we see a youthful fair By white clothed board her watery drug prepare, At further corner of a noisy room, Where only casual stragglers deign to come, Like tavern's busy bar-maid; still I say, The honours of thy course are pass'd away. Again hath auctioneer thy value praised, Again have rival bidders on thee gazed, But not the gay, the young, the fair, I trow! No; sober connoisseurs, with wrinkled brow And spectacles on nose, thy parts inspect, And by grave rules approve thee or reject. For all the bliss which china charms afford, My lady now has ceded to her lord. And wisely too does she forego the prize, Since modern pin-money will scarce suffice For all the trimmings, flounces, beads and lace, The thousand needful things that needs must grace Her daily changed attire.âAnd now on shelf Of china closet placed, a cheerless elf, Like moody statesman in his rural den, From power dismiss'dâlike prosperous citizen, From shop or change set freeâuntoward bliss! Thou rest'st in most ignoble uselessness. THE MOODY SEER: A BALLAD. âThe sun shines in a cloudless sky, The lake is blue and still; Up, Flora! on thine errand hie, And climb the eyrie hill; âAnd tell my ancient kinsman there To leave his lonely tower, And at our yearly feast to share The merry social hour.â âOh mother! do not bid me go; I scarce can draw my breath, When I see his eyes move to and fro, His lowering brows beneath; âHis moving lips, that give no sound, My very spirits quell, When he stares upon the harmless ground As 'twere the mouth of hell.â âFy, foolish child!âon such a day Aught ill thou needst not fear, And thy cousin Malcolm will the way With tale or ballad cheer.â The maiden blush'd and turn'd her head, And saw young Malcolm near, And she thought no more of scath or dread, Or the looks of the moody Seer. And now, bound for the mountain hold, The youthful pair are seen, He like a stripling frank and bold, She like a fairy queen. With merry songs and merry talk The long way cheated he, And pluck'd her blue-bells from the stalk, And blossoms from the tree. Time (how they wist not) swiftly ran, Till scarcely half a rood From the opening gate of the gifted man, With beating hearts they stood. Then issued from that creaking gate A figure bent and spare, In checker'd garb of ancient state, With grizzled, shaggy hair. By motion, look, and mien, he seem'd Of gentle pedigree, Well struck with years, you might have deem'd, But more with misery. He raised his face to the youthful pair, Gramercy! can it be? There passeth a glance of pleasure there, And a smile of courtesy. âMy cousin's daughter near my hold! Some message kind, I trow. But no, fair maid, I am too old To mix in revels now. âAnd who is this so gay and young?â No, no! thou needst not tell; His mother is from Garelace sprung, His sire from bold Glenfell. âHis mother's smile is on his face, His father's form I see, Those well-knit limbs of active grace, Those feetâit cannot be! âOut, out! mine eyes see falsely! toss'd And drifted by the wind, Some beldame's kerchief hath been lost, And round his brogues hath twined.â Thus muttering low, with voice unsweet, He turn'd his face aside, And hastily snatch'd at Malcolm's feet, But the close-clutch'd palm was void. âWhy gropest thou with thy trembling hand? Thinkst thou my feet are bound? Let loose thy house-guard, famous Brand, And I'll out-run the hound.â âAh! swiftest race is soonest o'er, Like stream of the mountain brook: Go home, and con some sober lore, Betake thee to bead and book.â âYes, I will pray to Mary mild, And my first request shall be, That from all fancies grim and wild, Thou mayst deliver'd be.â Then anger tinged the maid's round checkâ âCome, Malcolm, come away! When Hallow-e'en blows chill and bleak, Macvorely will join our play.â âWhen Hallow-e'en blows bleak and chill An old man's seat prepare, For if life and strength be in him still, Macvorely will be there.â The old man sigh'd, as down the hill They took their homeward way, And he heard afar so loud and shrill Young Malcolm's joyous lay. 'Tis Hallow-e'en in Flora's home, Bright shines the fir-wood flame; From distant halls and holds are come Maid, youngster, laird, and dame. Their friets are tried true love to proveâ Friets taught by warlock lore, And mingled lovers gladly move Upon the crowded floor. And flaming nuts are keenly watch'd By many a youthful eye, And coleworts, from the dark mould snatch'd, Are borne triumphantly. Then gay strathspeys are featly danced To the pibroch's gallant sound, While the sighted man like one intranced, In the honour'd chair is found. But who comes now so buoyantly, In flaunting kirtle dress'd, Who snaps her fingers, capers high, And foots it with the best? She leaps and crosses, wheels and turns, Like mawkin on the lea, Till every kindred bosom burns Such joyous sight to see. Her dark eyes gleam'd, and her ribands stream'd, And bells and bracelets rung, And the charm'd rout raised a joyous shout As her arms aloft she flung. Out spoke a bachelor, Glenore, Of threescore years and ten, And well respected heretofore By prudent, wary men: âO were I now as I have been (Vain wish! alas how vain!) I would plight my faith to that winsome queen, And with my freedom twain.â But nought cared she for laugh, or shout, Or cheers from every tongue; She circled in, and she circled out, Through all the yielding throng, Until before the honour'd chair With sliding step she came, And dropp'd a sober curtsey there To the Seer of elrich fame. But ah! how different is his face From those so blithe and boon! Tears down his cheeks the big tears chase, Like thunder-drops in June. âNay, weep not, kind though hapless Seer; Forgive my foolish glee, That, flaunting thus in woman's gear, Thought to deceive e'en thee. âI've danced before thee, vain and proud, In crimson kirtle drest.â âThou'st danced before me in a shroud, Raised mid-way to thy breast.â Dull grew the sound of the crowded hall, Yet Malcolm danced again, And did for rousing pibrochs call, But pipers piped in vain. Before the early cock had crow'd, Withdrawn was every guest; Ere on high Ben a sun-beam glow'd, All were retired to rest. A goodly ship at anchor rides, With freight of British store, And a little boat from her shadow glides, Swift nearing to the shore. And, on that shore, kind hearts and true, Small groups of kinsfolk stand, To bid a much-loved youth adieu, Who quits his native land. There Flora and her mother dear Heave many a heavy sigh, And by them is the moody Seer, With red and lowering eye. âWeep not, dear aunt!â says the parting wight, âWeep not, my play-mate sweet! Hope beckons me to fortune bright, And we again shall meet. âAnd, good Macvorely, send me hence With thy blessing; on me pour Some mutter'd spell of sure defence, When wild waves round me roar. âThis band that round my neck is tied, Is the gift of a maiden dear, Fenced with thy potent spell beside, What danger need I fear?â âI see no band around thy neck, But the white shroud gather'd high: Yon breakers rage, and a stranded wreck Doth on the dark rocks lie. âA solemn requiem for the dead Is the gift I will give to thee; O that, to save thee, in thy stead, The same were sung for me!â Yet still the youth, with parting cheer, Extends to all his hand; Embraces those who are most dear, And hastens from the land. His form reflected on the wave, As the lessening boat withdrew, Of that joyous youth, so boon and brave, Was their last heart-moving view. In Flora's home the midnight blast Rose with a wailing moan, And all had to their chambers past, And the maiden sat alone. She thought of the seaman's perilous case As the loud gust went and came, And she gazed on the fire with a woeful face, And watch'd the flickering flame. The flickering flame burnt dull and blue, And the icy chill of fear Pass'd o'er her head; then well she knew Some ghastly thing was near. She turn'd her head the room to scan, To wot if aught was there; And she saw a figure wet and wan Three paces from her chair. Fix'd were the eyes of its pallid face, Like those who walk in sleep, And she started up and pray'd for grace With a voice suppress'd and deep. Then gazing on that face, at length, She knew the features dear; She spoke,âaffection lent her strength, âMalcolm, how cam'st thou here?â âHow spirits travel, dear, dear maid! No living wight may know, But far from hence my corse is laid, The deep green waves below.â âO Malcolm say, in this world of care Is there aught I can do for thee?â âWhen thou bendest thy knees in humble prayer, My Flora, pray for me; âAnd let my kinsfolk know the fate Of one so young and vain. And now farewell, till time's last date, When we shall meet again.â The figure faded from her sight, And the angry tempest fell, And she heard through the stilly air of night A distant passing bell. THE MERRY BACHELOR (FOUNDED ON THE OLD SCOTCH SONG OF âWILLIE WAS A WANTON WAG.â) Willie was a wanton wag, The blithest lad that e'er I saw; Of field and floor he was the brag, And carried a' the gree awa'. And was na' Willie stark and keen, When he gaed to the wappen-schaw; He won the prizes on the green, And cheer'd the feasters in the ha'. His head was wise, his heart was leal, His truth was fair without a flaw; And aye by every honest chiel His word was holden as a law. And was na' Willie still our pride When, in his gallant gear array'd, He wan the broose and kiss'd the bride, While pipes the wedding welcome play'd. And aye he led the foremost dance, Wi' winsome maidens buskit braw, And gave to each a merry glance That stole, awhile, her heart awa'. The bride forgot her simple groom, And every lass her trysted Jo; Yet nae man's brow on Will could gloom, They liked his rousing blitheness so. Our good Mess John laugh'd wi' the lave; The dominie for a' his lere Could scarcely like himsell behave, While a' was glee and revel there. A joyous sight was Willie's face, Baith far and near in ilka spot; In ha' received wi' kindly grace, And welcomed to the lowly cot. The carline left her housewife's wark, The bairnies shouted Willie's name; The colley too would fidge and bark And wag his tail when Willie came. But Willie now has cross'd the main, And he has been sae lang awa'! Oh! would he were return'd again To drive the dowffness frae us a'! TWO SONGS. I. Come rouse thee, lady fair, The sun is shining brightly, High through the cloadless air The sea-bird roving lightly. Come, from thy lattice look; With many an oar in motion, Boats have the creek forsook, And course the azure ocean. See on the dim waves borne, White distant sails are gliding; Good, on so fair a morn, Is every heart abiding. II. (FOR FISHERMEN.) The waves are rippling on the sand, The winds are still, the air is clear; Then gather round, my merry band, We'll hold on shore an hour of cheer! The lord keeps vigil in his hall, The dame in bower or turret high; But meet the merriest mates of all Beneath the summer's starlight sky! SONG WRITTEN FOR THE STRAWBERRY HILL FOUNDING PLAY, AND SUNG BY MRS. JORDAN With the rough blast heaves the billow, In the light air waves the willow, Every thing of moving kind Varies with the veering wind; What have I to do with thee, Dull, unjoyous Constancy? After fretted, pouting sorrow, Sweet will be thy smile to-morrow Changing still, each passing thing Fairest is upon the wing: What have I to do with thee, Dull, unjoyous Constancy? Song of love and satire witty, Sprightly glee and doleful ditty; Every mood and every lay, Welcome all, but do not stay; For what have I to do with thee, Dull, unjoyous Constancy? TO SOPHIA J.BAILLIE. AN INFANT. Sweet bud of promise, fresh and fair, Just moving in the morning air. The morn of life but just begun, The sands of time just set to run! Sweet babe with cheek of pinky hue, With eyes of soft ethereal blue, With raven hair like finest down Of unfledged bird, and scantly shown Beneath the cap of cumbrous lace, That circles round thy placid face! Ah, baby! little dost thou know How many yearning bosoms glow, How many lips in blessings move, How many eyes beam looks of love At sight of thee! Some future day, And grant it, Heaven! thou wilt repay The early love of loving friends With oft renew'd and dear amends. Affection true, as with a spell, Hath many ways her tale to tell: And thou, with lightsome laughing eye, Thy artless love wilt testify By proffer'd kisses oft repeated, And words at will, when thou art seated On the paternal knee, in glory, Rehearsing there thy mimic storyâ By little errands, run so fleetly For dear mamma; and when so featly Thou dost for her the Dunsbourne heather, The primrose and the daisy gather, The daisy fresh with unbruised stem, Like thee a âbright and bonny gemââ All this, and more than I can say, Will show thy love some future day; Sweet bud of hope, beloved, carest, Upon thy head heaven's blessing rest! THE KITTEN. Wanton droll, whose harmless play Beguiles the rustic's closing day, When, drawn the evening fire about, Sit aged crone and thoughtless lout, And child upon his three-foot stool, Waiting until his supper cool, And maid, whose cheek outblooms the rose, As bright the blazing fagot glows, Who, bending to the friendly light, Plies her task with busy sleight; Come, show thy tricks and sportive graces, Thus circled round with merry faces! Backward coil'd and crouching low, With glaring eyeballs watch thy foe, The housewife's spindle whirling round, Or thread or straw that on the ground Its shadow throws, by urchin sly Held out to lure thy roving eye; Then stealing onward, fiercely spring Upon the tempting faithless thing. Now, wheeling round with bootless skill, Thy bo-peep tail provokes thee still, As still beyond thy curving side Its jetty tip is seen to glide; Till from thy centre starting far, Thou sidelong veerst with rump in air Erected stiff, and gait awry, Like madam in her tantrums high; Though ne'er a madam of them all, Whose silken kirtle sweeps the hall, More varied trick and whim displays To catch the admiring stranger's gaze. Doth power in measured verses dwell, All thy vagaries wild to tell? Ah no! the start, the jet, the bound, The giddy scamper round and round, With leap and toss and high curvet, And many a whirling somerset, (Permitted by the modern muse Expression technical to use) These mock the deftest rhymester's skill, But poor in art, though rich in will. The featest tumbler, stage bedight, To thee is but a clumsy wight, Who every limb and sinew strains To do what costs thee little pains; For which, I trow, the gaping crowd Requite him oft with plaudits loud. But, stopp'd the while thy wanton play, Applauses too thy pains repay: For then, beneath some urchin's hand With modest pride thou tak'st thy stand, While many a stroke of kindness glides Along thy back and tabby sides. Dilated swells thy glossy fur, And loudly croons thy busy purr, As, timing well the equal sound, Thy clutching feet bepat the ground, And all their harmless claws disclose Like prickles of an early rose, While softly from thy whisker'd cheek Thy half-closed eyes peer, mild and meek. But not alone by cottage fire Do rustics rude thy feats admire. The learned sage, whose thoughts explore The widest range of human lore, Or with unfetter'd fancy fly Through airy heights of poesy, Pausing smiles with alter'd air To see thee climb his elbow-chair, Or, struggling on the mat below, Hold warfare with his slipper'd toe. The widow'd dame or lonely maid, Who, in the still but cheerless shade Of home unsocial, spends her age, And rarely turns a letter'd page, Upon her hearth for thee lets fall The rounded cork or paper ball, Nor childes thee on thy wicked watch, The ends of ravell'd skein to catch, But lets thee have thy wayward will, Perplexing oft her better skill. E'en he, whose mind of gloomy bent, In lonely tower or prison pent, Reviews the coil of former days, And loathes the world and all its ways, What time the lamp's unsteady gleam Hath roused him from his moody dream, Feels, as thou gambol'st round his seat, His heart of pride less fiercely beat, And smiles, a link in thee to find, That joins it still to living kind. Whence hast thou then, thou witless puss! The magic power to charm us thus? Is it that in thy glaring eye And rapid movements, we descryâ Whilst we at ease, secure from ill, The chimney corner snugly fillâ A lion darting on his prey, A tiger at his ruthless play? Or is it that in thee we trace, With all thy varied wanton grace, An emblem, view'd with kindred eye, Of tricky, restless infancy? Ah! many a lightly sportive child, Who hath like thee our wits beguiled, To dull and sober manhood grown, With strange recoil our hearts disown. And so, poor kit! must thou endure, When thou becom'st a cat demure, Full many a cuff and angry word, Chased roughly from the tempting board. But yet, for that thou hast, I ween, So oft our favour'd play-mate been, Soft be the change which thou shalt prove! When time hath spoil'd thee of our love, Still be thou deem'd by housewife fat A comely, careful, mousing cat, Whose dish is, for the public good, Replenish'd oft with savoury food, Nor, when thy span of life is past, Be thou to pond or dung-hill cast, But, gently borne on goodman's spade, Beneath the decent sod be laid; And children show with glistening eyes The place where poor old pussy lies. SCHOOL RHYMES FOR NEGRO CHILDREN. How happy are we in that hour we love, When shadows grow longer and branches move; Blithe urchins then we be! From the school's low porch, with a joyous shout, We rush and we run and we gambol about, So careless, light, and free! And the good child merrily plays his part, For all is well in his guileless heart, The glance of his eye is bright. We hop and we leap and we toss the ball; Some dance to their shadows upon the wall, And spread out their hands with delight. The parrot that sits on her bough a-swinging, The bird and the butterfly, light air winging, Are scarcely more happy, I trow. Then hey for the meadow, the glade, and the grove, For evening is coming and branches move, We'll have merry pastime now! RHYMES. Busy work brings after ease; Ease brings sport and sport brings rest; For young and old, of all degrees, The mingled lot is best. And pain brings pity; then I hear My mother's sweet and gentle voice, She strokes my cheek, the touch is dear, And makes my heart rejoice. Then welcome work and pain and play; When all is o'er, like bird in nest, We soundly sleep;âwell says our lay The mingled lot is best. RHYMES FOR CHANTING. Butterfly, butterfly, speed through the air, The ring-bird follows thee fast, And the monkey looks up with a greedy stare; Speed on till the peril be past! O, wert thou but safe in my garden bower. And wouldst thou no further stray. Thou shouldst feed on the rose and the gilliflower, And be my play-mate gay. DEVOTIONAL SONG FOR A NEGRO CHILD. When at rising morn we lave Our dark limbs in the shiny wave, When beneath the palm-tree shade We rest awhile in freshness laid, And, when our early task is done, Whom should we love to think upon? When we noonday slumber take, In grassy glade or bowery brake, Where humming birds come glancing by, And stingless snakes untwisted lie, And quietly sounds the beetle's drone, Whom should we love to think upon? When, all awake, we shout and sing, And dance and gambol in a ring, Or, healthful hunger to relieve, Our stated wholesome meals receive,â When this is past and day is done, Whom should we love to think upon? On God, the giver of all good, Who gives us life, and rest, and food, And cheerful pastime, late and early, And parents kind who love us dearly;â God hath our hearts with goodness won, Him will we love to think upon! SECOND DEVOTIONAL SONG. Our heavenly Father sent His Son From hateful sin to save us, And precious blessings many a one, Health, friends, and freedom gave us. And all we see, each beauteous sight, The woods, the fields, the ocean, The sun by day, the moon by night, Should fill us with devotion. Then let our praises be express'd In light and lively measure, He loves the grateful homage best That is bestow'd with pleasure! THIRD DEVOTIONAL SONG. Our Father and Almighty Lord, By angels and by saints ador'd, With starry brightness circled round, Gleam beyond gleam, which hath no bound, Though He is high and we are low, Accepts the grateful thanks that flow From infant lips, and to the skies, Like morning's early vapour rise:â The simplest child who lisps a prayer His mercy and His love will share. A NURSERY LESSON (DEVOTIONAL). Say, little child, who gives to thee Thy life and limbs, so light and free? Thy moving eyes to look around, Thy ears to catch the softest sound? Thy food and clothing, friends and home? 'Tis God from whom those blessings come; And what shouldst thou do? canst thou guess? To prove to Him thy thankfulness For life and friends, for clothes and food?â âBe good.â And tell me, little-one, I pray, Who gives thee pleasure in thy play? Who makes the happy girl and boy To run, and leap, and shout for joy, When looking on the clear blue sky; The clouds that float, the birds that fly; Trees, flowers, and every pretty thing? 'Tis God from whom those blessings spring; And in return what shouldst thou do? âBe good, and love Him too.â SECOND NURSERY LESSON (ADMONITORY). Fat Tommy on the carpet lay, And held with sprightly kit his play. To her the twisted cord he flung, At which with teeth and claws she sprung; His worsted ball then past her roll'd, Which soon within her clutching hold She whirl'd, and check'd, and tugg'd, and tore, Then sent it rolling as before. Tommyâhis blue eyes glancing bright, View'd all these antics with delight; Then fondly stroked her tabby fur, And smiled to see her wink and purr; And then her ears began to touch, Which she endured, but liked not much; Then did her hinder parts assail, And pinch'd and pull'd her by the tail. On this her sudden anger rose, She turn'd and growl'd, and scratch'd his nose. Then Tommy roar'd like any bull And saidâhis eyes with tears brim fullâ âMamma, beat kit.âââAnd why?â quoth she. âBeat naughty kit for scratching me, And teach her not to scratch again.â âNo child, such teaching were in vain. She can feel pain, but lacks the wit To learn a lesson; but we'll hit Upon a plan more plain and easy. Tommy has sense to learn, so, please ye, Let him be taught this simple lore, To pull his play-mate's tail no more.â HYMN. Father and Lord! Almighty and all-wise! How ardently devout affections rise, When rushing thoughts, unsought for, swift and free, Crowd on th' expanded heart, and speak of Thee! All mingling, soaring, brightening, how they shine In truth's strong light, and say that we are Thine! This world a temple is, where man descries Signs visible, where'er he turns his eyes, That Thou art good as wise and mighty; love The active power that doth through all things move. A vasty temple, paved with sea and land, Adorn'd with forests, hills and mountains grand, And coped aloft with beauty, ever changing As white clouds o'er cerulean blue are ranging, As rosy splendour glows, line after line, At day's glad waking, or at day's decline; As full or crescent moons shine softly bright Through the air-floated awnings of the night; As stars from deepen'd darkness, fiercely burning, Keep round their northern guide for ever turning! Such thoughts do visit us like friends indeed, Who help and comfort in the hour of need; And sacred lore repeat, e'en that bless'd line, âliving and dying, we are Thine.â The dying soldier stretch'd on battle ground, While swells amain the deep and ghastly wound, Amidst his fallen comrades laid, The maim'd, the dying, and the dead; Thinks of his home, the distant and the dear, Then in his heart repeats these words of cheer. She, too, whose little flock of love are led To stand once more around her dying bed, Blesses them one by one, and when the last Hath from her fondly lingering vision past, Raises her eyes to worship and adore, And feels the bitterness of death is o'er; Casting behind her mortal love and fear, She feels that she is Thine, and Thou art near. The man who in this mingled world of woe, Dire warfare holds with many a galling foe; With poverty, disgrace, disease, and pain, And bravely fronting all, can still maintain, Like gallant liegeman, his appointed post, Hath succour still at hand when wanted most.â âLet all these foes to work my woe combine, Living and dying, Father, I am Thine.â But oh! to trace what forms of mortal ill This thought hath conquer'd, baffles human skill. Yes, we are Thine, Almighty Lord and Sire, With souls endow'd to reason and aspire: Reason, Thy gifted spark of heavenly flame, The noblest inmate of the human frame; By which, in all Thy works, Thyself we see, And love, obey, adore, and worship Thee! RECOLLECTIONS OF A DEAR AND STEADY FRIEND. When life's long pilgrimage draws to a close, A backward glance the weary traveller throws On many a league traversed, and views the road, Distant and near, in long perspective trod By him and by companions on his way, Who still hold onward, whether grave or gay, Through gloom and gleam; a cheeker'd path, I ween, Where forms within the memory's ken are seen, Forms faint or vivid, varying oft, that seem Like moving objects in a seried dream: Till one right dearly on the mind impress'd Bears for a time his thoughts from all the rest. And, undisturb'd upon his peaceful station. His busy mind enjoys its mournful occupation. There she appears, as when in virgin grace I first beheld her laughing, lovely face, Intelligent withal, in which combined Seem'd every hopeful quality of mind, Solace, and cheer, and counsel, to impart, All that should win and hold a manly, generous heart. I see her mated with a moody lord, Whose fame she prized, whose genius she adored. There by his side she stands, pale, grave, and sad; The brightness of her greeting smile is fled. Like some fair flower ta'en from its genial mould To deck a garden-border, loose and cold, Its former kindred fences all destroy'd, Shook by the breeze and by the rake annoy'd. She seem'd, alas!âI look'd, and look'd again, Tracing the sweet but alter'd face in vain. I see her next in agony of soul: Her surcharged feelings broke from all control. The hand upon her forehead closely press'd, The trembling frame and quivering lips express'd, Though scarcely audible the feeble mutter, Far more than full articulate sounds could utter. I see her when by pure religion taught Her heart is lighten'd of its heavy fraught. Her canopy of murky clouds hath pass'd, In air dissolved, and sunshine gleams at last. Her heart, with Christian charity imbued, Hath every hard vindictive thought subdued. Oh, then how fair a sight it was to trace That blessed state upon her placid face! And yet, when weary of the gossip sound From morning visitors convening round, She would at times unusual silence hold, Some, ah how erringly! believed her stiff and cold. I see her from the world retired caressing Her infant daughter, her assured blessing; Teaching the comely creature, in despite Of froward freaks, to feel and act aright; Well suiting to the task her voice and look With fondling playfulness or grave rebuke. Now, with expression changed, but sweet, she cheers Her widow'd father's weary weight of years. How slily does her gentle hint recall Some half forgotten tale of cot or hall, To raise his hearty laugh, as by the fire In easy chair he sits! old tales that never tire. To early friends her love was firm and fast; Beneath her roof they gather'd oft and cast A faint reflected gleam of days gone by, And kindly smiled on them her soft blue eye. One dearly prized may special notice claim, Mary Montgomery! nobly sounding name, And worthy she to bear it. Oft would come Their youthful kindred; to an easy home, Where they might still their fairy gambols hold, Nor in her presence fear to be too bold. Though tired and languid, laid awhile to rest, Around her still the active urchins press'd, Would o'er the tumbled covering strive and wrestle, And e'en at times behind her snugly nestle. At hide and seek where did they lurk and crouch? Ay, where forsooth but in my lady's couch! Mock frowns from her but small impression made, They gambol'd on, and would not be afraid. Books were her solace, whether grave or gay, But most she loved the poet's plaintive lay; And e'en at times with knit considerate brow Would with her pen a native talent show. When fancy, link'd with feelings kind and dear, Was found in lines that did not please the ear, Oh then, with what a countenance she met Her certain fate, by critics sore beset! She met it all with simple kindly air, The first to own and then the fault repair. Mistress at length of wealth and large domain, Behold her now a modest state maintain, With generous heart and liberal hand bestowing,â A spring of friendly kindness, ever flowing. She did with such a gentle ease relieve, From her it was a pleasure to receive. With the consideration of a friend, All was arranged to serve a useful end, And no humiliation could ensue To make the wounded heart her bounty rue. Nay, rather its condition seem'd to rise, Knit to her then as if by kindred ties. For worth distress'd there was in sooth no need In earnest pitcous words with her to plead, Nor feel, because of some slight boons obtain'd, But recently perhaps, shy and restrain'd: Her cheerful eye gave answer short and plain, âThink not of that, but come and come again.â The humming of her school, its morning sound, With all her youthful scholars gather'd round; Their shout, when issuing forth at mid-day hour, Each active lad exerting all his pow'r To do the sturdy labour of a man, As through the groups quick emulation ran, Was music to her ear; warm thrill'd her blood; She felt she was promoting public good. And have I seen her proud or heard her boast? Yes, once I did; when, counting use and cost, She gravely added, that her boys thus train'd, Employment afterwards more surely gain'd From farmer, or from village artisan, Who trusted each would prove a steady man. In truth, her school had in its humble station Acquired an honest fame and reputation. I've seen, when in a daughter's happy lot Her own was brighten'd, woes and cares forgot. While with a roguish grandchild few could quell, A sturdy imp that loved his grandame well, She lowly sate upon the carpet playing, The former frolics of her youth betraying,â A pleasing sight, that led to deep reflection; To pain and pleasure link'd in close connection. And now within her chamber-walls confined She sadly dwells and strives to be resign'd. Her span of life, yet short, though rough the past, May still through further years of languor last, Or health to other years may yet be given To do her Master's willâthe will of heaven. But should her lot be pain and sickness still, She hath her task of duty to fulfillâ Her task of love, cheer'd by her noble trust, The Christian's lofty faith, that from the dust Lifts up the Christian's head, gleams in his eye, Bracing his wasted strength to live or die. Ay, 'tis a noble faith, not fenced and bound By orthodoxy's narrow plot of ground. The Bible, not the Church, directs her way, Nor does she through entangled labyrinths stray. Before her stands a prospect fair and wide, To endless distance stretch'd on either side; A gen'rous Saviour, beckoning us to come Where mercy has prepared our peaceful home; Where God, His God, supreme all powers above, Receives us in the realms of sanctity and love. If late or early from her house of clay, The lease expired, her soul be turn'd away, What boots it? ready for her Master's call, Death's gloomy pass no longer can appal. The covering o'er a pallid face is thrown, The coffin closed, and all the rest unknownâ âNo, not unknown,â a conscious spirit cries, Stirring within us quickly; we shall rise To nobler being waked; heaven's glorious show, The varied wonders of the earth below, And He who spake as never man did speak, All tell of future happiness to break On the departed just, whilst Nature's voice Of many tones doth in that mighty sound rejoice. But in what order we shall leave this scene, Where all our joys, affections, cares have been, Ah! who can say? the young and strong may stand Close to the hidden confines of that land From which no traveller returns again, Whose sights and sounds in mystery remain: But there full surely do the aged wait An hourly summons to the unknown state. Report perhaps of my decease may find Her on a weary couch of pain reclined, And some dear silent watcher then may see Her soft eye glistening with a tear for meâ But cease we hereâo'er fancy's sight is thrown A closing veilâmy vision'd thoughts are gone. TWO BROTHERS. Who presses on my knee this kindly pat, And with a merry archness in my face Looks up?âa youngling of my own leal race: Com'st thou to woo my notice, little Matt? I think thou dost, and thou shalt have it too, For, whatsoe'er thou dost or dost not do, Thou hast upon my heart a potent claim,â Matthew Baillie is thy name; And worn by thee, O never may The light transmitted fade away! The virtues of thy grandsire's manly breast, May they within thy bosom ever rest! Far be from thee, dear child, e'en in thy play, A crooked cunning trick or selfish way,â All greedy grasping, or of cake or toy! Thou must be generous, kind, and true, my boy! And if, in after days, thou needst must fight With angry schoolmates, wrestle for the right. Whate'er the poor or wealthy do, thou must Frank and straightforward be, faithful and just. No seeking favour with fair glozing words! No dangling after little patron lords! In thee, or man or boy, still let us see Traces of him whose name now honours thee. He pass'd through life with conscience for his guide, Nor hesitated, wink'd, nor turn'd aside. He lived in courts, all courtly failings near, And knew not feigning, flattery, or fear. Be thou a Matthew then from right unswerving. And of thy name deserving. Ah, little man! thy roguish eye When those thou lov'st are standing by, Thy scowling brow and stormy voice, When thwarted of thy will or choice, Show thou wilt have no easy play Old aunty's precepts to obey. Ay! and wee Willie too is near, His gladsome, cooing voice, I hear; And there he comes in all his charms, Set perching in his nurse's arms. In his sweet face beam smiles of love That o'er cheeks, chin, and forehead move; Fat dimpled arms, and shoulders bare, The same emotion seem to share; Yea, could we see thee all, we should discover Thou art one living smile all over. Thy small foot too, tinged like the rose, With all its spread and stirring toes, Its tiny heel and ankle stout, From muslin coaties peeping outâ What part of thee can we behold That is not worth a mine of gold? Thy open mouth that offers kisses So winningly, and seldom misses A kind return, full twenty-fold, From stern or gentle, young or old; Come sweet temptation! nearâmore near, And let me feel its pressure dear! Thou little, loving, harmless baby, Ah! what progressive changes may be; When, with thy youth and manbood, future years Have dealt, and on thy countenance appears The mark'd expression of thy inward worth, By joy, and grief, and love, and generous ire drawn forth! Could we e'en now thy future fortunes know, Thy character and thy endowments!âNo; Why look through onward time to see What thou, dear baby, then mayst be? I will not from the present part, Loving so dearly what thou art. Matthew and William, brothers twain, God's blessing on your heads remain! Soft pretty signs and tokens tell That now ye love each other well, And nature's self and parents kind Will round your hearts this blessing bind. In sacred words to each dear brother, A grand-aunt's say concludes,ââlove one another.â LINES TO AGNES BAILLIE ON HER BIRTHDAY. Dear Agnes, gleam'd with joy and dash'd with tears, O'er us have glided almost sixty years Since we on Bothwell's bonny braes were seen, By those whose eyes long closed in death have been, Two tiny imps, who scarcely stoop'd to gather The slender harebell, or the purple heather; No taller than the foxglove's spiky stem, That dew of morning studs with silvery gem. Then every butterfly that cross'd our view With joyful shout was greeted as it flew, And moth and lady-bird and beetle bright In sheeny gold were each a wondrous sight. Then as we paddled barefoot, side by side, Among the sunny shallows of the Clyde, Minnows or spotted par with twinkling fin, Swimming in mazy rings the pool within, A thrill of gladness through our bosoms sent, Seen in the power of early wonderment. A long perspective to my mind appears, Looking behind me to that line of years, And yet through every stage I still can trace Thy vision'd form, from childhood's morning grace To woman's early bloom, changing how soon! To the expressive glow of woman's noon; And now to what thou art, in comely age, Active and ardent. Let what will engage Thy present moment, whether hopeful seeds In garden-plat thou sow, or noxious weeds From the fair flower remove, or ancient lore In chronicle or legend rare explore, Or on the parlour hearth with kitten play, Stroking its tabby sides, or take thy way To gain with hasty steps some cottage door, On helpful errand to the neighbouring poor, Active and ardent, to my fancy's eye Thou still art young in spite of time gone by. Though oft of patience brief and temper keen, Well may it please me, in life's latter scene, To think what now thou art, and long to me hast been. 'Twas thou who woo'dst me first to look Upon the page of printed book, That thing by me abhorr'd, and with address Didst win me from my thoughtless idleness, When all too old become with bootless haste In fitful sports the precious time to waste. Thy love of tale and story was the stroke At which my dormant fancy first awoke, And ghosts and witches in my busy brain Arose in sombre show, a motley train. This new-found path attempting, proud was I, Lurking approval on thy face to spy, Or hear thee say, as grew thy roused attention, âWhat! is this story all thine own invention?â Then, as advancing through this mortal span, Our intercourse with the mix'd world began, Thy fairer face and sprightlier courtesy (A truth that from my youthful vanity Lay not conceal'd) did for the sisters twain, Where'er we went, the greater favour gain; While, but for thee, vex'd with its tossing tide, I from the busy world had shrunk aside. And now in later years, with better grace Thou helpst me still to hold a welcome place With those, whom nearer neighbourhood has made The friendly cheerers of our evening shade. With thee my humours, whether grave or gay, Or gracious or untoward, have their way. Silent if dullâO precious privilege! I sit by thee; or if, cull'd from the page Of some huge, ponderous tome, which, but thyself, None e'er had taken from its dusty shelf, Thou read me curious passages to speed The winter night, I take but little heed And thankless say âI cannot listen now,â 'Tis no offence; albeit, much do I owe To these, thy nightly offerings of affection, Drawn from thy ready talent for selection; For still it seem'd in thee a natural gift The letter'd grain from letter'd chaff to sift. By daily use and circumstance endear'd, Things are of value now that once appear'd Of no account, and without notice past, Which o'er dull life a simple cheering cast; To hear thy morning steps the stair descending, Thy voice with other sounds domestic blending; After each stated nightly absence, met To see thee by the morning table set, Pouring from smoky spout the amber stream Which sends from saucer'd cup its fragrant steam; To see thee cheerly on thethreshold stand, On summer morn, with trowel in thy hand For garden-work prepared; in winter's gloom From thy cold noonday walk to see thee come, In furry garment lapp'd, with spatter'd feet, And by the fire resume thy wonted seat; Ay, e'en o'er things like these, soothed age has thrown A sober charm they did not always own: As winter-hoarfrost makes minutest spray Of bush or hedge-weed sparkle to the day, In magnitude and beauty, which bereaved Of such investment, eye had ne'er perceived. The change of good and evil to abide, As partners link'd, long have we side by side Our earthly journey held, and who can say How near the end of our united way? By nature's course not distant; sad and 'reft Will she remain,âthe lonely pilgrim left. If thou be taken first, who can to me Like sister, friend, and home-companion be? Or who, of wonted daily kindness shorn, Shall feel such loss, or mourn as I shall mourn? And if I should be fated first to leave This earthly house, though gentle friends may grieve, And he above them all, so truly proved A friend and brother, long and justly loved, There is no living wight, of woman born, Who then shall mourn for me as thou wilt mourn. Thou ardent, liberal spirit! quickly feeling The touch of sympathy and kindly dealing With sorrow or distress, for ever sharing The unhoarded mite, nor for to-morrow caring,â Accept, dear Agnes, on thy natal day, An unadorn'd but not a careless lay. Nor think this tribute to thy virtues paid From tardy love proceeds, though long delay'd. Words of affection, howsoe'er express'd, The latest spoken still are deem'd the best: Few are the measured rhymes I now may write; These are, perhaps, the last I shall endite. VERSES SENT TO MRS. BAILLIE ON HER BIRTHDAY, 1813. A judgment clear, a pensive mind With feelings tender and refined; A generous heart in kindness glowing, An open hand on all bestowing; A temper sweet, and calm, and even Through petty provocations given; A soul benign, whose cheerful leisure Considers still of others' pleasure, Or, in its lonely, graver mood, Considers still of others' good; And join'd to these the vision'd eye, And tuneful ear of poesy; Blest wight, in whom those gifts combine, Our dear Sophia, sister mine! How comes it that, from year to year, This day hath pass'd without its cheer,â No token passing time to trace, No rhymester's lay to do it grace? Love was not wanting, but the muse, Reserved, unpliant, and recluse, Sat in her unreal kingdom, dreaming Through baseless scenes of airy seeming, And could not turn her 'wilder'd eye On plain, unfancied verity. Yet be it so! once in my life I'll hold with her a generous strife; With or without her aid, my lay Shall hail with grateful lines this happy day: The day when first thy infant heart Did from inactive being start, And in thy baby bosom beat, Its doubtful, dangerous, fragile seat,â A heavenly spark that downward came To mount again a brighter flame. Meantime, a warm and fostering blessing. More precious felt in long possessing, 'Tis lent to those who daily prove Its gentle offices of love. Ah! for their sake, long be the date Of this its more ignoble state! I who, so near its influence set, Owe it a long and pleasing debt, In course of being launch'd before From mortal nature's foggy shore, Would fain behind me leave some token Of friendly kindred love unbroken. Which in some hour, retired and lone. Thine eyes may sometimes look upon, While in thy sadden'd tender breast,â Ah, no! I may not think the rest, Lest, both bereft of words and strain My silent thoughts alone remain: This token then do thou receive. I will not tell thee to believe How in my heart its spirit glows, How soothly from my pen it flows. Through years unmark'd by woe or pain, Oft may this day return again, Blessed by him whose rough career Of toil and care thy love doth cheer, Whose manly worth by heaven was fated To be through life thus fitly mated; Blessed by those thy youthful twain, Who by thy side their place maintain, Still nestling closer to thy bosom As the fair flowers of reason blossom; By all who thy dear kindred claim, And love to see thy face, and love to hear thy name. And so I end my simple writing. The muse in fault, but love enditing That which, but for this love alone, I thought not ever to have done,â A birth-day lay. Then sister mine, Keep thou in kindness this propine, And through life's yet untrodden scene Still be to me what thou hast been! VERSES WRITTEN IN FEBRUARY, 1827. Like gleam of sunshine on the mountain's side, Fair, bright, and beautiful, while all beside, Slope, cliff, and pinnacle, in shadow lie Beneath the awning of a wintry sky, Through loop-hole in its cloudy texture beaming A cataract of light so softly streaming,â Shines one blest deed of ruth when war's grim form O'er a scourged nation guides his passing storm. Like verdant islet-spots, that softly peer Through the dull mist, as morning breezes clear The brooding vapour from the wide-stretch'd vale, So in a land where Mammon's cares prevail, Do frequent deeds of gentle charity Refresh the moral gazer's mental eye. Britain, thou art in arms and commerce graced With many generous acts, that, fairly traced On thy long annals, give a lustre far Exceeding those of wealth or trophied war; And may we not say truthfully of thee, Thou art a land of mercy?âMay it be! What forms are those with lean gall'd sides? In vain Their lax'd and ropy sinews sorely strain Heap'd loads to draw, with lash and goad urged on. They were in other days, but lately gone, The useful servants, dearly prized, of those Who to their failing age give no repose,â Of thankless, heartless owners. Then full oft Their arched graceful necks so sleek and soft Beneath a master's stroking hand would rear Right proudly, as they neigh'd his well-known voice to hear. But now how changed!âAnd what marr'd things are these, Starved, hooted, scarr'd, denied or food or ease; Whose humbled looks their bitter thraldom show, Familiar with the kick, the pinch, the blow? Alas! in this sad fellowship are found The playful kitten and the faithful hound, The gallant cock that hailed the morning light, All now hard-fated mates in woeful plight. Ah no! a land of mercy is a name Which thou in all thy glory mayst not claim! But yet there dwell in thee the good, the bold, Who in thy streets, courts, senates, bravely hold Contention with thy wayward cruelty, And shall subdue it ere this age glide by. Meantime, as they their manly power exert, âGod speed you well!â bursts from each kindly heart. And they will speed; for this foul blot of shame Must be wash'd out from Britain's honour'd name, And she among enlighten'd nations stand, A brave, a merciful, and generous land. THE TRAVELLER BY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER. He, who with journey well begun, Beneath the morning's cheerful sun Stretches his view o'er hill and dale, And distant city, (through its veil Of smoke, dark spires and chimneys seen,) O'er harvest-lands and meadows green, What time the roused and busy, meeting On king's high-way exchange their greeting, Feels his cheer'd heart with pleasure beat, As on his way he holds. And great Delight hath he who travels late When the fair moon doth hold her state In the clear sky, while down and dale Repose in light so pure and pale! While lake and pool and stream are seen Weaving their maze of silvery sheen, And cot and mansion, rock and glade, And tower and street in light and shade Strongly contrasted are. I trow, Better than noonday seems his show, Soothing the pensive mind. And yet, When moon is dark and sun is set, Not reft of pleasure is the wight, Who, in snug chaise, at close of night, Begins his journey in the dark, With crack of whip and ban-dogs' bark, And jarring wheels and children bawling, And voice of surly ostler, calling To post-boy, through the mingled din, Some message to a neighbouring inn. All sounds confusedly in his ear; The lonely way's commencing cheer. With dull November's starless sky O'er head, his fancy soars not high. The carriage lamps a white light throw Along the road, and strangely show Familiar things that cheat the eyes, Like friends in motley masker's guise. âWhat's that? or dame, or mantled maid, Or herd-boy gather'd in his plaid, Who leans against yon wall his back?â âNo 'tis in sooth a tiny stack Of peat, or turf, or cloven woodâ For cottage fire the winter's food.â âHa! yonder shady nook discovers A gentle pair of rustic lovers.â âOut on't! a pair of harmless calves, Through ragged bushes seen by halves.â âWhat thing of strange, unshapely height, Approaches slowly on the light, That like a hunch-back'd giant seems, And now is whitening in its beams?â â'Tis but a hind, whose burly back Is bearing home a well-fill'd sack.â âWhat's that like spots of flecker'd snow On the road's margin cluster'd so?â â'Tis linen left to bleach by night.ââ âGramercy on us! see I right? Some witch is casting cantraps there, The linen hovers in the air!â âPooh! soon or late all wonders cease We have but scared a flock of geese.â Thus oft through life we do misdeem Of things that are not what they seem. Ah! could we there with as slight scath Divest us of our cheated faith! And then, belike, when chiming bells The near approach of waggon tells, He wistful looks to see it come, Its bulk emerging from the gloom, With dun tarpauling o'er it thrown, Like a huge Mammoth moving on. But still more pleased, through murky air He spies the distant bonfire's glare; And, nearer to the spot advancing, Black imps and goblins round it dancing; And nearer still, distinctly traces The featured disks of happy faces, Grinning and roaring in their glory, Like Bacchants wild of ancient story, Making wild gestures to the flame As it were play-mate in the game. Full well, I trow, could modern stage Such acting for the nonce engage, A crowded audience, every night, Would press to see the jovial sight; And this, from cost and squeezing free, November's nightly travellers see. Through village, lane, or hamlet going, The light from cottage window, showing Its inmates at their evening fare, By rousing fire, where earthenware With pewter trenchers, on the shelf, Give some display of worldly pelf, Is transient vision to the eye Of him our hasty passer by; Yet much of pleasing import tells, And cherish'd in his fancy dwells, Where simple innocence and mirth Encircle still the cottage hearth. Across the road a fiery glare Doth now the blacksmith's forge declare, Where fnrnace-blast, and measured dim Of heavy hammers, and within The brawny mates their labour plying, From heated bar the red sparks flying, Some idle neighbours standing by With open mouth and dazzled eye; The rough and sooty walls with store Of chains and horse shoes studded o'er, And rusty blades and bars between, All momently are heard and seen. Nor does he often fail to meet, In market town's dark, narrow street, (E'en when the night with onward wings The sober hour of bed-time brings,) Amusement. From the alehouse door, Having full bravely paid his score, Issues the tipsy artizan, With some sworn brother of the can, While each to keep his footing tries, And utters words solemn and wise. The dame demure, from visit late, Her lantern borne before in state By sloven footboy, paces slow With patten'd feet and hooded brow. Where the seam'd window-board betrays Interior light, right closely lays The caves-dropper his curious ear, Some neighbour's fire-side talk to hear; While, from an upper casement bending, A household maid, perhaps, is sending From jug or pot, a sloppy shower That makes him homeward fleetly scour. From lower rooms few gleams are sent Through shorten'd shutter-hole or rent; But from the loftier chambers peer (Where damsels doff their gentle gear For rest preparing) tapers bright, That give a momentary sight Of some fair form with visage glowing, With loosen'd braids and tresses flowing, Which busied by the mirror stands With bending head and upraised hands, Whose moving shadow strangely falls With size enlarged on roof and walls. Ah! lovely are the things, I ween, By speed's light passing glam'rie seen! Fancy so touch'd will oft restore Things once beheld and seen no more. But now he spies the flaring door Of bridled Swan or gilded Boar, At which the bowing waiter stands To know the alighting guest's commands. A place of bustle, dirt and din, Swearing without, scolding within; Of narrow means and ample boast, The traveller's stated halting post, Where trunks are missing or deranged, And parcels lost and horses changed. Yet this short scene of noisy coil But serves our traveller as a foil, Enhancing what succeeds, and lending A charm to pensive quiet, sending To home and friends, left far behind, The kindliest musings of his mind; Or, should they stray to thoughts of pain, A dimness o'er the haggard train A mood and hour like this will throw, As vex'd and burthen'd spirits know. Night, loneliness, and motion are Agents of power to distance care; To distance, not discard; for then, Withdrawn from busy haunts of men, Necessity to act suspended, The present, past, and future blended, Like figures of a mazy dance, Weave round the soul a dreamy trance, Till jolting stone or turnpike gate Arouse him from the soothing state. And when the midnight hour is past, If through the night his journey last, When still and lonely is the road, Nor living creature moves abroad, Then most of all, like fabled wizard, Night slily dons her cloak and vizard, His eyes at every corner meeting With some new sleight of dexterous cheating, And cunningly his sight betrays E'en with his own lamp's partial rays. The road, that in fair, honest day, Through pasture-land or corn-fields lay, A broken hedge-row's ragged screen Skirting its margin rank and green, With boughs projecting, interlaced With thorn and briar, distinctly traced On the deep shadows at their back, That deeper sink to pitchy black, Appearing soothly to the eye Like woven boughs of tapestrie,â Seems now to wind through tangled wood, Or forest wild, where Robin Hood With all his outlaws stout and bold In olden days his reign might hold. Yea, roofless barn and ruin'd walls, As passing light upon them falls, When favour'd by surrounding gloom, The castle's stately form assume. The steaming vapour that proceeds From moisten'd hide of weary steeds, And high on either side will rise, Like clouds storm-drifted, past him flies; While mire cast up by their hoof'd feet Adds curious magic to deceit, Glancing presumptuously before him, Like yellow diamonds of Cairngorum. How many are the sultle ways By which sly night the eye betrays, When in her wild fantastic mood, By lone and wakeful traveller woo'd! Shall I proceed? O no! for now Upon the black horizon's brow Appears a line of tawny light; Thy reign is ended, witching night! And soon thy place a wizard elf, (But only second to thyself In glam'rie's art) will quietly take, And spread o'er meadow, vale, and brake, Her misty shroud of pearly white; A modest though deceitful wight, Who in a softer, gentler way Will with the wakeful fancy play, When woody knolls, their bases losing, Are islands on a lake reposing, And streeted town of high pretence, As rolls away the vapour dense With all its wavy, curling billows, Is but a row of pollard willows. O no! our traveller, still and lone, A far, fatiguing way hath gone; His eyes are dim, he stoops his crest, And folds his arms and goes to rest. LINES FOR A FRIEND'S ALBUM. Lines, in addition to the treasure Of poesy, cull'd for the pleasure Of beau, and belle, and gentle dame, When seated round the evening flame, What time the social hour is waning, And tardy coachman guests detaining,â A courteous friend hath bid me write Upon her Album's pages white. But age the casy grace hath lost That would become such pages most, While of a quondam rhymester's skill, Scarce aught is extant but the will; And sober, stinted age must use The school-girl's worn and stale excuse, When, long her correspondent's debtor, The apology becomes the letter. Apologies for those who need'em! An Album is a thing of freedom, Receiving all with right good will That fortune sends from many a quill, And then displays like scaly store Which fisher's net brings to the shore: The herring sheath'd in silvery green, The whiting in its pearly sheen, The lithe and wavy eel that glides Athwart the mackerel's tabbied sides; John Dory with his dolphin head, Where amber fins like horns are spread, And flounder, sole, and thornback, all In turn on some observer call, To mark each varied form and tint; And from this simile a hint Of some encouragement I take, And humbly this my offering make, Which if received with favour, truly Will show that I have reckon'd duly On what might homelier things commend,â On the good nature of a friend. ADDRESS TO A STEAMVESSEL. Freighted with passengers of every sort, A motley throng, thou leav'st the busy port: Thy long and ample deck,âwhere scatter'd lie Baskets and cloaks and shawls of crimson dye; Where dogs and children through the crowd are straying, And on his bench apart the fiddler playing, While matron dames to tressel'd seats repair,â Seems, on the glassy waves, a floating fair. Its dark form on the sky's pale azure cast, Towers from this clustering group thy pillar'd mast; The dense smoke, issuing from its narrow vent, Is to the air in curly volumes sent, Which coiling and uncoiling on the wind, Trail, like a writhing serpent, far behind. Beneath, as each merged wheel its motion plies, On either side the white-churn'd waters rise, And newly parted from the noisy fray, Track with light ridgy foam thy recent way, Then far diverged, in many a lustrous line On the still-moving distant surface shine. Thou holdst thy course in independent pride; No leave ask'st thou of either wind or tide. To whate'er point the breeze inconstant veer, Still doth thy careless helmsman onward steer; As if the stroke of some magician's wand Had lent thee power the ocean to command. What is this power which thus within thee lurk And all unseen, like a mask'd giant works? E'en that which gentle dames at morning tea, From silver urn ascending, daily see With tressy wreathings borne upon the air Like loosen'd ringlets of a lady's hair; Or rising from th' enamell'd cup beneath, With the soft fragrance of an infant's breath: That which within the peasant's humble cot Comes from the uncover'd mouth of savoury pot, As his kind mate prepares his noonday fare, Which cur and cat and rosy urchins share; That which, all silver'd by the moon's pale beam Precedes the mighty Geyser's up-cast stream, What time, with bellowing din, exploded forth, It decks the midnight of the frozen north, While travellers from their skin-spread couches rise To gaze upon the sight with wondering eyes. Thou hast to those âin populous city pentâ Glimpses of wild and beauteous nature lent, A bright remembrance ne'er to be destroy'd, That proves to them a treasure long enjoy'd, And for this scope to beings erst confined, I fain would hail thee with a grateful mind. They who had nought of verdant freshness seen, But suburb orchards choked with coleworts green, Now, seated at their ease, may glide along. Loch Lomond's fair and fairy isles among; Where bushy promontories fondly peep At their own beauty in the nether deep, O'er drooping birch and rowan red that lave Their fragrant branches in the glassy wave: They who on higher objects scarce have counted Than church-spire with its gilded vane surmounted, May view within their near, distinctive ken The rocky summits of the lofty Ben; Or see his purple shoulders darkly lower Through the dim drapery of a summer shower. Where, spread in broad and fair expanse, the Clyde Mingles his waters with the briny tide, Along the lesser Cumbray's rocky shore, With moss and crusted lichens flecker'd o'er, He who but warfare held with thievish cat, Or from his cupboard chaced a hungry rat, The city cobbler,âscares the wild sea-mew In its mid-flight with loud and shrill halloo; Or valiantly with fearful threatening shakes His lank and greasy head at Kittywakes.â The eyes that have no fairer outline seen, Than chimney'd walls with slated roofs between, Which hard and harshly edge the smoky sky, May Arran's softly-vision'd peaks descry, Coping with graceful state her steepy sides O'er which the cloud's broad shadow swiftly glides, And interlacing slopes that gently merge Into the pearly mist of ocean's verge. Eyes which admired that work of sordid skill, The storied structure of a cotton mill, May wondering now behold the unnumber'd host Of marshall'd pillars on fair Ireland's coast, Phalanx on phalanx ranged with sidelong bend, Or broken ranks that to the main descend, Like Pharaoh's army on the Red Sea shore, Which deep and deeper sank, to rise no more. Yet ne'ertheless, whate'er we owe to thee, Rover at will on river, lake, and sea, As profit's bait or pleasure's lure engage, Offspring of Watt, that philosophic sage, Who in the heraldry of science ranks With those to whom men owe high meed of thanks For genius usefully employ'd, whose fame Shall still be link'd with Davy's splendid name; Dearer to fancy, to the eye more fair Are the light skiffs, that to the breezy air Unfurl their swelling sails of snowy hue Upon the moving lap of ocean blue: As the proud swan on summer lake displays, With plumage brightening in the morning rays, Her fair pavilion of erected wings, They change, and veer, and turn like living things. With ample store of shrouding, sails, and mast, To brave with manly skill the winter blast Of every clime,âin vessels rigg'd like these Did great Columbus cross the western seas, And to the stinted thoughts of man reveal'd What yet the course of ages had conceal'd: In such as these, on high adventure bent, Round the vast world Magellan's comrades went. To such as these are hardy seamen found As with the ties of kindred feeling bound, Boasting, while cans of cheering grog they sip, The varied fortunes of âour gallant ship:â The offspring these of bold sagacious man, Ere yet the reign of letter'd lore began. In very truth, compared to these, thou art A daily labourer, a mechanic swart, In working weeds array'd of homely gray, Opposed to gentle nymph or lady gay, To whose free robes the graceful right is given To play and dally with the winds of heaven. Beholding thee, the great of other days And modern men with all their alter'd ways, Across my mind with hasty transit gleam, Like fleeting shadows of a feverish dream: Fitful I gaze, with adverse humours teased, Half sad, half proud, half angry, and half pleased. SONG, WOO'D AND MARRIED AND A', (VERSION TAKEN FROM AN OLD SONG OF THAT NAME.) The bride she is winsome and bonny, Her hair it is snooded sae sleek, And faithfu' and kind is her Johnny, Yet fast fa' the tears on her cheek. New pearlins are cause of her sorrow, New pearlins and plenishing too, The bride that has a' to borrow, Has e'en right mickle ado, Woo'd and married and a'! Woo'd and married and a'! Is na' she very weel aff To be woo'd and married at a'? Her mither then hastily spak, âThe lassie is glaikit wi' pride; In my pouch I had never a plack On the day when I was a bride. E'en tak' to your wheel, and be clever, And draw out your thread in the sun; The gear that is gifted, it never Will last like the gear that is won. Woo'd and married and a'! Wi' havins and toucher sae sma'! I think ye are very weel aff, To be woo'd and married at a'!â âToot, toot!â quo' her grey-headed faither, âShe's less o' a bride than a bairn, She's ta'en like a cout frae the heather, Wi' sense and discretion to learn. Half husband, I trow, and half daddy, As humour inconstantly leans, The chiel maun be patient and steady, That yokes wi' a mate in her teens. A kerchief sae douce and sae neat, O'er her locks that the winds used to blaw! I'm baith like to laugh and to greet, When I think o'her married at a'!â Then out spak' the wily bridegroom, Weel waled were his wordies, I ween, âI'm rich, though my coffer be toom, Wi' the blinks o' your bonny blue een. I'm prouder o' thee by my side, Though thy ruffles or ribbons be few, Than if Kate o' the Croft were my bride, Wi' purfles and pearlins enow. Dear and dearest of ony! Ye're woo'd and buikit and a'!â And do ye think scorn o' your Johnny, And grieve to be married at a'?â She turn'd, and she blush'd, and she smiled, And she looket sae bashfully down; The pride o' her heart was beguiled, And she played wi' the sleeves o' her gown; She twirled the tag o' her lace, And she nippet her boddice sae blue, Syne blinket sae sweet in his face, And aff like a maukin she flew. Woo'd and married and a'! Wi' Johnny to roose her and a'! She thinks hersel very weel aff, To be woo'd and married at a'! A SONG (WRITTEN FOR MR. STRUTHER'S COLLECTION OF SONGS.) It was on a morn, when we were thrang, The kirn it croon'd, the cheese was making, And bannocks on the girdle baking, When ane at the door chapp't loud and lang. Yet the auld gudewife and her mays sae tight, Of a' this bauld din took sma' notice I ween; For a chap at the door in braid day-light, Is no like a chap that's heard at e'en. But the docksy auld laird of the Warlock glen, Wha waited without, half blate, half cheery, And lang'd for a sight o' his winsome deary, Raised up the latch, and cam' crousely ben. His coat it was new, and his o'erlay was white, His mittens and hose were cozie and bien; But a wooer that comes in braid day-light, Is no like a wooer that comes at e'en. He greeted the carline and lasses sae braw, And his bare lyart pow, sae smoothly he straikit, And he looket about, like a body half glaikit, On bonny sweet Nanny, the youngest of a'. âHa laird!â quo' the carline, âand look ye that way? Fy, let na' sic fancies bewilder you clean: An elderlin man, in the noon o' the day, Should be wiser than youngsters that come at e'en.â âNa, na,â quo' the pawky auld wife, âI trow, You'll no' fash your head wi' a youthfu' gilly, As wild and as skeigh as a muirland filly; Black Madge is far better and fitter for you.â He hem'd and he haw'd, and he drew in his mouth, And he squeezed the blue bannet his twa hands between, For a wooer that comes when the sun's i'the south, Is mair landward than wooers that come at e'en. âBlack Madge is sae carefuâ'ââWhat's that to me?â âShe's sober and eydent, has sense in her noddle: She's douce and respeckitâââI care na' a bodle: Love winna be guided, and fancy's free.â Madge toss'd back her head wi' a saucy slight, And Nanny, loud laughing, ran out to the green; For a wooer that comes when the sun shines bright Is no like a wooer that comes at e'en. Then away flung the laird, and loud mutter'd he, âA' the daughters of Eve, between Orkney and Tweed, O! Black or fair, young or auld, dame or damsel or widow, May gang in their pride to the de'il for me!â But the auld gudewife and her mays sae tight Cared little for a' his stour banning, I ween; For a wooer that comes in braid day-light, Is no like a wooer that comes at e'en. FY, LET US A' TO THE WEDDING. (AN AULD SANG, NEW BUSKIT.) Fy, let us a' to the wedding, For they will be lilting there; For Jock's to be married to Maggy, The lass wi' the gowden hair. And there will be jibing and jeering, And glancing of bouny dark een, Loud laughing and smooth-gabbit speering O' questions baith pawky and keen. And there will be Bessy the beauty, Wha raises her cockup sae hie, And giggles at preachings and duty, Guid grant that she gang na' ajee! And there will be auld Geordie Taunser, Wha coft a young wife wi' his gowd; She'll flaunt wi' a silk gown upon her, But wow! he looks dowie and cow'd. And brown Tibby Fouler the Heiress Will perk at the tap o' the ha', Encircled wi' suitors, wha's care is To catch up her gloves when they fa',â Repeat a' her jokes as they're cleckit, And haver and glower in her face, When tocherless mays are negleckit,â A crying and scandalous case. And Mysie, wha's clavering aunty Wad match her wi' Laurie the Laird, And learns the young fule to be vaunty, But neither to spin nor to caird. And Andrew, wha's Granny is yearning To see him a clerical blade, Was sent to the college for learning, And cam' back a coof as he gaed. And there will be auld Widow Martin, That ca's hersel thritty and twa! And thraw-gabbit Madge wha for certain Was jilted by Hab o' the Shaw. And Elspy the sewster sae genty, A pattern of havens and sense, Will straik on her mittens sae dainty, And crack wi' Mess John i' the spence. And Angus, the seer o' ferlies, That sits on the stane at his door, And tells about bogles, and mair lies Than tongue ever utter'd before. And there will be Bauldy the boaster, Sae ready wi' hands and wi' tongue; Proud Paty and silly Sam Foster, Wha quarrel wi' auld and wi' young: And Hugh the town-writer, I'm thinking, That trades in his lawerly skill, Will egg on the fighting and drinking To bring after-grist to his mill: And Maggyâna, na! we'll be civil, And let the wee bridie a-be; A vilipend tongue is the devil, And ne'er was encouraged by me. Then fy, let us a' to the wedding, For they will be lilting there, Frae mony a far-distant ha'ding, The fun and the feasting to share. For they will get sheep's head, and haggis, And browst o' the barley-mow; E'en he that comes latest, and lag is, May feast upon dainties enow: Veal florentines in the o'en baken, Weel plenish'd wi' raisins and fat Beef, mutton, and chuckies, a' taken Het reeking frae spit and frae pat: And glasses (I trow 'tis na' said ill), To drink the young couple good luck, Weel fill'd wi' a braw beechen ladle Frae punch-bowl as big as Dumbuck. And then will come dancing and daffing, And reelin and crossin o' hans, Till even auld Lucky is laughing, As back by the aumry she stans. Sic bobbing and flinging and whirling, While fiddlers are making their din; And pipers are droning and skirling, As loud as the roar o' the lin. Then fy, let us a' to the wedding, For they will be lilting there, For Jock's to be married to Maggy, The lass wi' the gowden hair. HOOLY AND FAIRLY. (FOUNDED ON AN OLD SCOTCH SONG.) Oh, neighbours! what had I a-do for to marry! My wife she drinks posset and wine o' Canary, And ca's me a niggardly, thraw-gabbit cairly, O, gin my wife wad drink hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad drink hooly and fairly! She sups wi' her kimmers on dainties enow, Aye bowing and smirking and wiping her mou', While I sit aside, and am helpit but sparely, O, gin my wife wad feast hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad feast hooly and fairly! To fairs and to bridals and preachings and a', She gangs sae light headed and buskit sae braw, In ribbons and mantuas that gar me gae barely! O, gin my wife wad spend hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad spend hooly and fairly! I' the kirk sic commotion last Sabbath she made, Wi' babs o' red roses and breast-knots o'erlaid! The Dominie stickit the psalm very nearly: O, gin my wife wad dress hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad dress hooly and fairly! She's warring and flyting frae morning till e'en, And if ye gainsay her, her een glow'r sae keen, Then tongue, nieve, and cudgel she'll lay on ye sairly: O, gin my wife wad strike hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad strike hooly and fairly! When tired wi' her cantrips, she lies in her bed, The wark a' negleckit, the chaumer unred, While a' our guid neighbours are stirring sae early: O, gin my wife wad wurk timely and fairly! Timely and fairly, timely and fairly, O, gin my wife wad wurk timely and fairly! A word o' guid counsel or grace she'll hear none; She bandies the Elders, and mocks at Mess John, While back in his teeth his own text she flings rarely: O, gin my wife wad speak hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, O, gin my wife wad speak hooly and fairly! I wish I were single, I wish I were freed; I wish I were doited, I wish I were dead, Or she in the mouls, to dement me nae mair, lay! What does it 'vail to cry hooly and fairly! Hooly and fairly, hooly and fairly, Wasting my breath to cry hooly and fairly! THE LADY IN HER CAR. (A NIGHT-SCENE BY THE SEA.) There is darkness on a dangerous coast, Where waves on waves are wildly toss'd. High cliffs, and rifted rocks between; The strife is terrific, and all unseen. Ay, loud is the roar of winds and waves, As strong contention wildly raves; A fearful sound of a fearful commotion,â The many angry voices of the ocean. Along the shore from cottage homes No sound of stirring inmate comes, Though some on restless beds there be Whose thoughts are with the wanderers of the sea. Hark! from the mingled din an utter'd sound, Distinct and awful, booming through the air, A signal of distress; some ship aground, With all her hardy crew to perish there! Another booming sound! must they be lost, Within man's hearing, on this ruthless coast? No, from the lady's window lights appear; There's stirring life within, and blessed help is near. And sooth to say, in some few minutes more The lady's car is at the door Herself into the seat is lifted, And to her hands the reins are shifted. But who is she, whose deeds fulfill The generous impulse of her will So quickly?âOne, with limbs nerve-bound, Whose feet have never trod the ground; Who loves, in tomes of Runick lore, To scan the curious tales of yore, Of gods and heroes, dimly wild; And hath intently oft beguiled Her passing hours with mystic rhymes, Legends by bards rehearsed of other times: Learned, and loving learning well; For college hall or cloister'd cell A student meet, yet all the while As meet with repartee and smile, 'Mid easy converse, polish'd, blithe, and boon, To join the circles of a gay saloon: From childhood rear'd in wealth and ease, The daily care herself to please, For selfish nature here below A dangerous state, I trow. Such is the dame who, reins in hand, Drives forth, and checks her courser on the strand, Where torches blaze, and figures rude Pictured on darkness, round her stood; And she on th' instant in that trying hour Becomes to them a spirit, and a pow'r To rouse, and to command,â Those hardy seamen she had taught To guide the life-boat with its fraught Of living souls, through surf and surge, And brave the whirling eddy's scourge. But now, all daunted, in amaze They doggedly upon her gaze, And sternly murmur short reply.â âWill ye then all stand coldly by; With faint hearts shrinking in dismay Let the dark deep devour its prey, Your friends, your brothers, gallant men, Who ne'er must see their homes again? But noâmy words her words may not express: Their generous import your own hearts will guess And they their lady's voice obey, Unto the boat-house wend their way, Launch the light vessel from the shore Amid the angry surges' roar; Vaulting and sinking, as they go The waves above, or waves below; While their mix'd words of terror, or of cheer, Sad friends upon the shore confus'dly hear. It was an awful thing for them to wait The issue of their comrades' doubtful fate.â Minutes like hours have slowly past, Each sadder, slower than the last, While fancied voices oft betray The wistful ear, and pass away. At length in sooth a nearing sound, though faint, Of oars and tongues from moderate distance sent! It cannot be the mocking tempest's cry. It comes again, must be reality; The boat, the boat! its iron tackles ringing! And from its sides man after man is springing, Who strangely rock and stagger on the land, As though they knew not how to stand. It is our own: they've nobly braved, And brought to shore their dearly saved. Loud shouts of thankful joy and pride From the beach inland echo far and wide. The Lady's grateful heart basis high, Whilst quick of thought, and quick of eye, She gives directions on the spot; And forthwith each in kindly cot, With raiment, food, and bed supplied, Cheered with soothing words beside, Five hardy seamen lay them down to sleep, Who else had seen no more the sun's glad ray, Whose place of rest before the peep of day Had been the yawning deep: Men, brave and useful, stark and strong, Who each to some loved home belong, Where loving mates and kinsfolk dear Think of their absent mariner with fear. Still on the beach some thoughtful stragglers stay To watch the earliest streak of coming day, As there it dimly marks the distant main: And the lady returns to her home again, With the sound of blessings in her ear From young and old her heart to cheer: Sweet thoughts within her secret soul to cherishâ The blessings of those who were ready to perish; And there lays her down on her peaceful pillow, Bless'd by the Lord of the wind and the billow. TO JAMES B. BAILLIE, AN INFANT. God's blessing rest upon thy harmless head, My little James! Well mayst thou ever speed On life's uncertain journey, firm and straight Thy onward steps unto the opening gate, At which the good and just shall enter in, And there a higher, happier life begin! Or rough or smooth the way that must be past, What boots it, if thou gain thy home at last? Yet, ne'ertheless I fain would hope that thou Shalt with thy playmates three be happy now, And throw a brightness round the native hearth, To cheer their grateful hearts who gave thee birth. Thy steps of eager speed at early day, Thine eyes of glancing joy in buoyant play, Thy words of sweet affection may delight Their yearning fondness, and dear hopes excite: Yea, Heaven perhaps thine aged Aunt may spare Some years in these thy childhood's beams to share; Thy fair beginning may her ending cheer, But aught beyond will not to her appear, And when to man's estate thou dost attain, No trace of her will in thy mind remain. Ay, so it needs must be, and be it so, Though ne'er for thee will heart more warmly glow! Thou wearst his name, who in his stinted span Of human life, a generous useful man, Did well the pastor's honour'd task perform. The toilsome way, the winter's beating storm, Ne'er kept him from the peasant's distant cot Where want or suffering were the inmate's lot, Who look'd for comfort in his friendly face, As by the sick-bed's side he took his place. A peace-maker in each divided home To him all strife-perplexed folk would come. In after years how earnestly he strove In sacred lore his students to improve! As they met round the academic chair Each felt a zealous friend address'd him there. He was thy grandsire's sire, who in his day, That, many years gone by, hath pass'd away, On human gratitude had many claims;â Be thou as good a man, my little James! THE WEARY PUND O' TOW. A young gudewife is in my house, And thrifty means to be, But aye she's runnin' to the town, Some ferlie there to see. The weary pund, the weary pund, the weary pund o' tow, I soothly think, ere it be spun, I'll wear a lyart pow. And when she sets her to her wheel To draw her threads wi' care, In comes the chapman wi' his gear, And she can spin nae mair. The weary pund, &amp; c. And she, like ony merry may, At fairs maun still be seen, At kirkyard preachings near the tent, At dances on the green. The weary pund, &amp; c. Her dainty ear a fiddle charms, A bagpipe's her delight, But for the crooning o' her wheel She disna care a mite. The weary pund, &amp; c. You spake, my Kate, of snaw-white webs, Made o' your linkum twine, But, ah! I fear our bonny burn Will ne'er lave web o' thine. The weary pund, &amp; c. Nay, smile again, my winsome mate, Sic jeering means nae ill, Should I gae sarkless to my grave, I'll lo'e and bless thee still. The weary pund, &amp; c. TAM O' THE LIN. Tam o' the Lin was fu' o' pride, And his weapon he girt to his valorous side, A scabbard o' leather wi' deil-haet within,â âAttack me wha daur!â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin he bought a mear, She cost him five shilling, she was na' dear, Her back stuck up and her sides fell in,â âA fiery yaud,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin he courted a may, She stared at him sourly and said him nay, But he stroked down his jerkin and cock'd up his chin,â âShe aims at a laird then,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin he gaed to the fair, Yet he look'd wi' disdain on the chapman's ware, Then chuck'd out a saxpence, the saxpence was tin,â âThere's coin for the fiddlers,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin wad show his lare, And he scann'd o'er the book wi' a wiselike stare, He mutter'd confusedly but didna begin,â âThis is Dominie's business,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin had a cow wi' ae horn, That liket to feed on his neighbour's corn, The stanes he threw at her fell short o' her skin,â âShe's a lucky auld reiver,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin he married a wife, And she was the torment, the plague o' his life; She lays sae about her, and makes sic a din,â âShe frightens the bailie,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin grew dowie and douce, And he sat on a stane at the end o' his house: What ails thee, auld chield? he looks haggard and thin,â âI'm no vera cheery,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. Tam o' the Lin lay down to die, And his friends whisper'd softly and woefully, We'll buy you some masses to scour away sin,â âAnd drink at my latewake,â quo' Tam o' the Lin. NEW WORDS TO THE OLD SCOTCH AIR OF âTHE WEE PICKLE TOW.â A lively young lass had a wee pickle tow, And she thought to try the spinning o't; She sat by the fire and her rock took a low, And that was an ill beginning o't. Loud and shrill was the cry that she utter'd, I ween; The sudden mischanter brought tears to her een; Her face it was fair, but her temper was keen; O dole for the ill beginning o't! She stamp'd on the floor and her twa hands she wrung, Her bonnie sweet mon' she crooket O! And fell was the outbreak o' words fra her tongue; Like one sair demented she looket O! âFoul fa' the inventor o' rock and o' reel! I hope, guid forgie me, he's now wi' the deil, He brought us mair trouble than help, wot I weel, O dole for the ill beginning o't!â And now when they're spinning and kemping awa', They'll talk o' my rock, and the burning o't, While Tibbie, and Mysie, and Maggie, and a' Into some silly joke will be turning it; They'll say I was doited, they'll say I was fou', They'll say I was dowie, and Robin untrue, They'll say in the fire some luve-pouther I threw, And that made the ill beginning o't! O curst be the day and unchancy the hour, When I sat me adown to the spinning o't! Then some evil spirit or warlock had pow'r, And made sic an ill beginning o't: May Spunkie my feet to the boggie betray, The lunzie folk steal my new kirtle away, And Robin forsake me for douce Effie Gray, The next time I try the spinning o't! SONG, CALLED âTHE COUNTRY LADY'S REVEILLIE.â From early fire wending The smoke is ascending, And with the clouds blending, Awake, awake! From green covert creeping Wild creatures are peeping, Fy! sloth of dull sleeping Forsake, forsake! The cocks are a-crowing, The kine are a-lowing, The milk-pail is flowing, Awake, awake! The dew-drops are gleaming, And bright eyes are beaming, The mist of pale dreaming Forsake, forsake! Now maidens are bracing, And bodices lacing, The slender form gracing, Awake, awake! On slipper'd toe stealing, Thy fair face revealing, The curtain's dark sheeling Forsake, forsake! VOLUNTEER'S SONG, WRITTEN IN 1803. Ye who Britain's soldiers be,â Freemen, children of the free, Who quickly come at danger's call, From shop and palace, cot and hall, And brace ye bravely up in warlike gear, For all that ye hold dear; Blest in your hands be sword and spear! There is no banded Briton here On whom some fond mate hath not smiled, Or hung in love some lisping child, Or aged parent, grasping his last stay, With locks of honour'd gray. Such men behold with steady pride, The threaten'd tempest gathering wide, And list with onward form inclined To sound of foe-men on the wind, And bravely act amid the battle's roar, In seenes untried before. Let veterans boast, as well they may, Nerves steel'd in many a bloody day; The generous heart, who takes his stand Upon his free and native land, Doth, with the first sound of the hostile drum, A fearless man become. Then come, ye hosts, that madly pour From wave-toss'd floats upon our shore! If fell or gentle, false or true, Let those inquire, who wish to sue: Nor fiend nor hero from a foreign strand, Shall lord it in our land. Come, then, ye hosts that madly pour From wave-toss'd floats upon our shore! An adverse wind or breezeless main Lock'd in their ports our tars detain, To waste their eager spirits, vainly keen, Else here ye had not been. Yet ne'ertheless, in strong array, Prepare ye for a well-fought day. Let banners wave and trumpets sound, And closing cohorts darken round, And the fierce onset raise its mingled roar, New sound on England's shore! Freemen, children of the free, Are brave alike on land or sea; And every rood of British ground, On which a hostile spear is found, Proves under their firm tread and vigorous stroke, A deck of royal oak. SONG, WRITTEN FOR AN IRISH AIR. The morning air plays on my face, And through the grey mist peering The soften'd sun I sweetly trace, Wood, moor, and mountain cheering, Larks aloft are singing, Hares from covert springing, And o'er the fen the wild-duck brood Their early way are winging. Bright every dewy hawthorn shines, Sweet every herb is growing, To him whose willing heart inclines The way that he is going. Clearly do I see now What will shortly be now; I'm patting at her door poor Tray, Who fawns and welcomes me now. How slowly moves the rising latch! How quick my heart is beating! That worldly dame is on the watch To frown upon our meeting. Fy! why should I mind her, See who stands behind her, Whose eye upon her traveller looks The sweeter and the kinder. O every bounding step I take, Each hour the clock is telling, Bears me o'er mountain, bourn, and brake, Still nearer to her dwelling. Day is shining brighter, Limbs are moving lighter, While every thought to Nora's love But binds my love the tighter. SONG, FOR AN IRISH AIR. Come, form we round a cheerful ring, And broach the foaming ale, And let the merry maiden sing, The beldame tell her tale. And let the sightless harper sit The blazing fagot near; And let the jester vent his wit, The nurse her bantling cheer. Who shakes the door with angry din, And would admitted be? No, Gossip Winter! snug within, We have no room for thee. Go scud it o'er Killarney's lake, And shake the willows bare, Where water-elves their pastime take, Thou'lt find thy comrades there. Will-o'-the-wisp skips in the dell, The owl hoots on the tree, They hold their nightly vigil well, And so the while will we. Then strike we up the rousing glee, And pass the beaker round, Till every head, right merrily, Is moving to the sound! A SCOTCH SONG. The gowan glitters on the sward, The lavrock's in the sky, And collie on my plaid keeps ward, And time is passing by. Oh no! sad and slow And lengthen'd on the ground, The shadow of our trysting bush, It wears so slowly round! My sheep-bell tinkles frae the west, My lambs are bleating near, But still the sound that I lo'e best, Alack! I canna' hear. Oh no! sad and slow, The shadow lingers still, And like a lanely ghaist I stand And croon upon the hill. I hear below the water roar, The mill wi' clacking din, And Lucky scolding frae her door, To ca' the bairnies in. Oh no! sad and slow, These are na' sounds for me, The shadow of our trysting bush, It creeps sae drearily! I coft yestreen, frae Chapman Tam, A snood of bonny blue, And promised when our trysting cam', To tie it round her brow. Oh no! sad and slow, The mark it winna' pass; The shadow of that weary thorn, Is tether'd on the grass. O now I see her on the way, She's past the witch's knowe, She's climbing up the Browny's brae, My heart is in a lowe! Oh no! tis no' so, 'Tis glam'rie I have seen; The shadow of that hawthorn bush, Will move na' mair till e'en. My book o' grace I'll try to read, Though conn'd wi' little skill, When collie barks I'll raise my head, And find her on the hill; Oh no! sad and slow, The time will ne'er be gane, The shadow of the trysting bush, Is fix'd like ony stane. SONG, POVERTY PARTS GOOD COMPANY, (FOR AN OLD SCOTCH AIR.) When my o'erlay was white as the foam o' the lin, And siller was chinkin my pouches within, When my lambkins were bleatin on meadow and brae, As I went to my love in new cleeding sae gay, Kind was she, and my friends were free, But poverty parts good company. How swift pass'd the minutes and hours of delight, When piper play'd cheerly, and crusie burn'd bright, And link'd in my hand was the maiden sae dear, As she footed the floor in her holyday gear! Woe is me; and can it then be, That poverty parts sic company? We met at the fair, and we met at the kirk, We met i' the sunshine, we met i' the mirk; And the sound o' her voice, and the blinks o' her een, The cheering and life of my bosom hae been. Leaves frae the tree, at Martinmass flee, And poverty parts sweet company. At bridal and infare, I braced me wi' pride, The broose I hae won, and a kiss o' the bride; And loud was the laughter good fellows among, As I utter'd my banter or chorus'd my song; Dowie and dree are jestin and glee, When poverty spoils good company. Wherever I gaed kindly lasses look'd sweet, And mithers and aunties were unco discreet; While kebbuck and bicker were set on the board; But now they pass by me, and never a word! Sae let it be, for the worldly and slee Wi' poverty keep nae company. But the hope of my love is a cure for its smart, And the spae-wife has tauld me to keep up my heart, For, wi' my last saxpence, her loof I hae crost, And the bliss that is fated can never be lost. Though cruelly we may ilka day see How poverty parts dear company. SONG, (FOR A SCOTCH AIR). O swiftly glides the bonny boat Just parted from the shore, And, to the fisher's chorus note, Soft moves the dipping oar! His toils are borne with lightsome cheer. And ever may they speed, Who feeble age, and helpmates dear, And tender bairnies feed. CHORUS. We cast our lines in Largo Bay, Our nets are floating wide, Our bonny boat with yielding sway Rocks lightly on the tide; And happy prove our daily lot, Upon the summer sea! And blest on land our kindly cot, Where all our treasures be! The Mermaid on her rock may sing, The Witch may weave her charm, Nor Water-Sprite, nor elrich thing The bonny boat can harm. It safely bears its scaly store Through many a stormy gale, While joyful shouts rise from the shore, Its homeward prow to hail. CHORUS. We cast our lines, &amp; c. A SAILOR'S SONG. While clouds on high are riding, The wintry moonshine hiding, The raging blast abiding, O'er mountain waves we go, We go, we go, we go, Bravely we go, we go. With hind, the dry land reaping,â With townsman, shelter keeping,â With lord, on soft down sleeping,â Change we our lot? O no! O no! O no! O no! Change we our lot? O no! On stormy main careering, Each sea-mate, sea-mate cheering, With dauntless helmsman steering, Our forthward course we hold, We hold, we hold, we hold, Our forthward course we hold, we hold. Their sails with sunbeams whiten'd, Themselves with glory brighten'd, From care their bosoms lighten'd, Who shall return?âthe bold; The bold, the bold, the bold; Only the bold! the bold! SONG, (A NEW VERSION OF AN OLD SCOTCH SONG) âSaw ye Johnny comin?â quo' she, âSaw ye Johnny comin? Wi' his blue bonnet on his head, And his doggie runnin? Yestreen about the gloamin time I chanced to see him comin, Whistling merrily the tune That I am a' day hummin,â quo' she, âI am a' day hummin.â âFee him, faither, fee him,â quo' she, âFee him, faither, fee him; A' the wark about the house Gaes wi' me when I see him: A' the wark about the house, I gang sae lightly through it; And though ye pay some merks o' gear, Hoot! ye winna rue it,â quo' she, âNo; ye winna rue it.â âWhat wad I do wi' him, hizzy? What wad I do wi' him? He's ne'er a sark upon his back, And I hae nane to gie him.â âI hae twa sarks into my kist, And ane o' them I'll gie him; And for a merk o' mair fee, O, dinna stand wi' him,â quo' she, âDinna stand wi' him.â âWeel do I lo'e him,â quo' she, âWeel do I lo'e him, The brawest lads about the place Are a' but haverels to him. O fee him, faither; lang I trow We've dull and dowie been; He'll haud the plough, thrash i' the barn, And crack wi' me at e'en,â quo' she, âCrack wi' me at e'en.â SIR MAURICE: A BALLAD. Sir Maurice was a wealthy lord, He lived in the north countrie; Well could he cope with foeman's sword, Or the glance of a lady's eye. Now all his armed vassals wait, A staunch and burly band, Before his stately Castle's gate, Bound for the Holy Land. Above the spearmen's lengthen'd file, Are pictured ensigns flying; Stroked by their keeper's hand the while, Are harness'd chargers neighing. And looks of woe, and looks of cheer, And looks the two between, On many a warlike face appear, Where tears have lately been. For all they love is left behind, Hope beckons them before; Their parting sails swell with the wind, Blown from their native shore. Then through the crowded portal pass'd Six goodly knights and tall, Sir Maurice himself, who came the last, Was goodliest of them all. And proudly roved his hasty eye O'er all the warlike train;â âSave ye! brave comrades!âprosperously, Heaven send us cross the main! âBut see I right?âan armed band From Moorham's lordless hall; And he, who bears the high command, Its ancient Seneschal! âReturn, your stately keep defend; Defend your lady's bower, Lest rude and lawless hands should rend That lone and lovely flower.â âGod will defend our lady dear, And we will cross the sea, From slavery's chain, his lot severe, Our noble lord to free.â âNay, nay! some wandering minstrel's tongue, Hath framed a story vain; Thy lord, his liege-men brave among, Near Acre's wall was slain.â âNay, good my lord! for had his life Been lost on battle-ground, When ceased that fell and fatal strife, His body had been found.â âNo faith to such delusion give; His mortal term is pastââ âNot so, not so! he is alive, And will be found at last!â These latter words, right eagerly, From a slender stripling broke, Who stood the ancient warrior by, And trembled as he spoke. Sir Maurice started at the sound, And all, from top to toe, The stripling scann'd, who to the ground, His blushing face bent low. âIs this thy kinsman, Seneschal? Thy own or thy sister's son? A gentler page, in tent or hall, Mine eyes ne'er look'd upon. âTo thine own home return, fair youth! To thine own home return; Give ear to likely, sober truth, Nor prudent counsel spurn. âWar suits thee not if boy thou art; And if a sweeter name Befit thee, do not lightly part With maiden's honour'd fame.â He turn'd him from his liege-men all, Who round their chieftain press'd; His very shadow on the wall His troubled mind express'd. As sometimes slow and sometimes fast He paced to and fro, His plumy crest now upwards cast In air, now drooping low. Sometimes, like one in frantic mood, Short words of sound he utter'd, And sometimes, stopping short, he stood As to himself he mutter'd: âA daughter's love, a maiden's pride! And may they not agree? Could man desire a lovelier bride, A truer friend than she? âDown, cursed thought! a stripling's garb, Betrays not wanton will; Yet sharper than an arrow's barb, That fear might wound me still.â He mutter'd long, then to the gate Return'd and look'd around, But the Seneschal and his stripling mate Were nowhere to be found. With outward cheer and inward smart In warlike, fair array, Did Maurice with his bands depart, And shoreward bent his way. Their stately ship rode near to port, The warriors to receive, And there, with blessings kind but short, Did friends of friends take leave. And soon they saw the crowded strand Wear dimly from their view, And soon they saw the distant land, A line of hazy blue. The white-sail'd ship with favouring breeze, In all her gallant pride, Moved like the mistress of the seas, That rippled far and wide. Sometimes with steady course she went, O'er wave and surge careering, Sometimes with sidelong mast she bent, Her wings the sea-foam sheering. Sometimes with poles and rigging bare She scudded before the blast, But safely by the Syrian shore Her anchor dropp'd at last. What martial honours Maurice won, Join'd with the brave and great, From the fierce, faithless Saracen, I may not here relate. With boldest band on bridge or moat, With champion on the plain, I' the narrow bloody breach he fought, Choked up with grisly slain. Most valiant by the valiant deem'd, Their praise his deeds proclaim'd, And the eyes of his liege-men brightly beam'd, When they heard their leader named. But fate will quell the hero's strength, And dim the loftiest brow, And this our noble chief at length Was in the dust laid low. He lay the heaps of dead beneath, As sank life's flickering flame, And thought it was the trance of death, That o'er his senses came. And when again day's blessed light Did on his vision fall, There stood by his sideâa wondrous sightâ The ancient Seneschal. He strove, but could not utter word; His misty senses fled; Again he woke, and Moorham's lord Was bending o'er his bed. A third time sank he as if dead, And then his eye-lids raising, He saw a chief with turban'd head, Intently on him gazing. âThe Prophet's zealous servant I; His battles I've fought and won: Christians I scorn, their creeds deny, But honour Mary's Son. âAnd I have wedded an English dame, And set her parent free; And none who bear an English name, Shall e'er be thrall'd by me. âFor her dear sake I can endure All wrong, all hatred smother; Whate'er I feel, thou art secure, As though thou wert my brother.â âAnd thou hast wedded an English dame!â Sir Maurice said no more, For o'er his heart soft weakness came, He sigh'd and wept full sore. And many a dreary day and night, With the Moslem Chief stay'd he, But ne'er could catch, to bless his sight, One glimpse of the fair lady. Oft gazed he on her lattice high, As he paced the court below, And turn'd his listening ear to try, If word or accent low Might haply reach him there; and oft Traversed the garden green, And thought some footstep, small and soft, Might on the turf be seen. And oft to Moorham's lord he gave His eager ear, who told How he became a wretched slave, Within that Syrian hold; What time from liege-men parted far, Upon the battle-field, By stern and adverse fate of war, He was compell'd to yield: And how his daughter did by stealth, So boldly cross the sea, With secret store of gather'd wealth, To set her father free: And how into the foeman's hands She and her people fell; And how (herself in captive bands) She sought him in his cell; And but a captive boy appear'd, Till grief her sex betray'd; And the fierce Saracen, so fear'd, Spoke kindly to the maid: How for her plighted hand sued he, And solemn promise gave, Her noble father should be free, With every Christian slave; (For many there, in bondage kept, Felt the base rule of vice,) How long she ponder'd, sorely wept, Then paid the fearful price. A tale that made his bosom thrill,â His faded eyes to weep; He waking thought upon it still, And saw it in his sleep. But harness rings, and the trumpet's bray Again to battle calls, And Christian Powers in grand array, Are near those Moslem walls. Sir Maurice heard; untoward fate! Sad to be thought upon! But the castle's lord unlock'd its gate, And bade his guest be gone. âFight thou for faith by thee adored, By thee so well maintain'd; But never may this trusty sword, With blood of thine be stain'd!â Sir Maurice took him by the hand, âGod bless thee too!ââhe cried; Then to the nearest Christian band, With mingled feelings hied. The battle join'd, with dauntless pride, 'Gainst foemen, foemen stood, And soon the fatal field was dyed With many a brave man's blood. At length gave way the Moslem force; Their valiant chief was slain; Maurice protected his lifeless corse, And bore it from the plain. There's mourning in the Moslem halls, A dull and dismal sound; The lady left its 'leaguer'd walls, And safe protection found. When months were past, the widow'd dame Look'd calm and cheerfully; Then Maurice to her presence came, And bent him on his knee. What words of penitence or suit He utter'd, pass we by; The lady wept, awhile was mute, Then gave this firm reply; âThat thou didst doubt my maiden pride, (A thought that rose and vanish'd So fleetingly) I will not chide; 'Tis from remembrance banish'd. âBut thy fair fame, earn'd by that sword, Still spotless shall it be: I was the bride of a Moslem lord, And will never be bride to thee.â So firm though gentle was her look, Hope on the instant fled; A solemn, dear farewell he took, And from her presence sped. And she a plighted nun became, God serving day and night; And he of blest Jerusalem, A brave and zealous knight, But that their lot was one of woe, Wot ye, because of this Their separate single state?âif so, In sooth ye judge amiss. She tends the helpless stranger's bed, For alms her wealth is stored; On her meek worth God's grace is shed, Man's grateful blessings pour'd. He still in warlike mail doth stalk, In arms his prowess prove; And oft of siege or battle talk, And sometimes of his love. His noble countenance the while, Would youthful listeners please, When with alter'd voice, and a sweet sad smile He utter'd such words as these: âShe was the fairest of the fair, The gentlest of the kind; Search ye the wide world every where, Her like ye shall not find. âShe was the fairest, is the best, Too good for a monarch's bride; I would not give her, in nun's coif drest, For all her sex beside.â TO MRS. SIDDONS. Gifted of heaven! who hast, in days gone by, Moved every heart, delighted every eye; While age and youth, of high and low degree, In sympathy were join'd, beholding thee, As in the Drama's ever changing scene, Thou heldst thy splendid state, our tragic queen! No barriers there thy fair domains confined, Thy sovereign sway was o'er the human mind; And, in the triumph of that witching hour, Thy lofty bearing well became thy power. The impassion'd changes of thy beauteous face, Thy stately form, and high imperial grace; Thine arms impetuous toss'd, thy robe's wide flow, And the dark tempest gather'd on thy brow; What time thy flashing eye and lip of scorn Down to the dust thy mimic foes have borne; Remorseful musings, sunk to deep dejection, The fix'd and yearning looks of strong affection; The active turmoil a wrought bosom rending, When pity, love, and honour, are contending: They who beheld all this, right well, I ween, A lovely, grand, and wondrous sight have seen. Thy varied accents, rapid, fitful, slow, Loud rage, and fear's snatch'd whisper, quick and low; The burst of stifled love, the wail of grief, And tones of high command, full, solemn, brief; The change of voice, and emphasis that threw Light on obscurity, and brought to view Distinctions nice, when grave or comic mood, Or mingled humours, terse and new, elude Common perception, as earth's smallest things To size and form, the vesting hoar-frost brings, That seem'd as if some secret voice, to clear The ravell'd meaning, whisper'd in thine ear, And thou hadst e'en with him communion kept, Who hath so long in Stratford's chancel slept; Whose lines, where nature's brightest traces shine, Alone were worthy deem'd of powers like thine; They who have heard all this, have proved full well Of soul-exciting sound, the mightiest spell. But though time's lengthen'd shadows o'er thee glide, And pomp of regal state is cast aside, Think not the glory of thy course is spent, There's moonlight radiance to thy evening lent, That, to the mental world can never fade, Till all who saw thee, in the grave are laid. Thy graceful form still moves in nightly dreams, And what thou wast, to the lull'd sleeper seems: While feverish fancy oft doth fondly trace Within her curtain'd couch thy wondrous face. Yea; and to many a wight, bereft and lone, In musing hours, though all to thee unknown, Soothing his earthly course of good and ill, With all thy potent charm, thou actest still. And now in crowded room or rich saloon, Thy stately presence recognized, how soon On thee the glance of many an eye is cast, In grateful memory of pleasures past! Pleased to behold thee, with becoming grace, Take, as befits thee well, an honour'd place (Where blest by many a heart, long mayst thou stand!) Among the virtuous matrons of our land. A SONG, WRITTEN FOR AN IRISH MELODY. His boat comes on the sunny tide, And briskly moves the flashing oar, The boatmen carol by his side, And blithely near the welcome shore. How softly Shannon's currents flow, His shadow in the stream I see; The very waters seem to know, Dear is the freight they bear to me. His eager bound, his hasty tread, His well-known voice I'll shortly hear; And oh, those arms so kindly spread! That greeting smile! that manly tear! In other lands, when far away, My love and hope were never twain; I saw him thus, both night and day, To Shannon's banks return'd again. SONG, FOR AN IRISH MELODY. The harper who sat on his green mossy seat, And harp'd to the youngsters so loud and so sweet, The far distant hum of the children at play, And the maiden's soft carol at close of the day,â Ah! this was the music delighted my ear, And to think of it now is so sad and so dear! Ah! to listen again, by mine own cottage door, To the sound of mine own native village once more! I knew every dame in her holiday airs; I knew every maiden that danced at our fairs; I knew every farmer to market who came, And the dog that ran after him call'd by its name. And whom know I now in this far distant land, But the stiff collar'd sergeant, and red-coated band? No kinsman to comfort his own flesh and blood; No merry-eyed damsel to do my heart good! To mine eye or mine ear no gay cheering e'er comes, But the flare of our colours, the tuck of our drums; The fierce flashing steel of our long muster'd file, And the sharp shrilly fifers a-playing the while. At night, as I keep on the wearisome watch, The sound of the west wind I greedily catch, Then the shores of dear Ireland will rise to my sight, And mine own native valley, that spot of delight! Divided so far by a wide stormy main, Shall I ever return to our valley again? Ah! to listen at ease by mine own cottage door, To the sound of mine own native village once more! SONG. Bird soaring high, cloud in the sky, Where go ye? O where go ye? Where the smoke from the gipsy's fire is veering, And our gay little boat, o'er the blue frith steering, Will soon bear me. My thoughts before, on yonder shore, Are free as wind, are free as wind, While this body of mine on its palfry riding, Right lazy of pace, or on smooth wave gliding, Is far behind. But see I not, yon distant spot? O now I see, O now I see! Where the mist up the distant hill is creeping, And woods through the morning cloud are peeping, There dwelleth she. Doth gentle sleep her senses steep? Or does she wake? or does she wake? E'en now, perhaps, her dark hair raising, At her casement she stands, o'er the waters she's gazing, All for my sake. Her face is gay as the joyous day, And O how sweet! and O how sweet! Her voice as she utters her modest greeting, While my heart at the sound is so quickly beating, Whene'er we meet! When time runs on, and weeks are gone, Then on that shore, then on that shore, I'll meet her with all my gay bridesmen bounding, In light-hearted glee to the minstrel's sounding, And part no more. SONG. WRITTEN AT MR. THOMSON'S REQUEST, AS A KIND OF INTRODUCTION TO HIS IRISH MELODIES. Sweet power of song! that canst impart To lowland swain or mountaineer A gladness thrilling through the heart, A joy so tender and so dear! Sweet power! that on a foreign strand Canst the rough soldier's bosom move With feelings of his native land, As gentle as an infant's love! Sweet power! that makest youthful heads, With thistle, leek, or shamrock crown'd, Nod proudly as the carol sheds Its spirit through the social round! Sweet power! that cheer'st the daily toil Of cottage maid or beldame poor, The ploughman on the furrow'd soil, Or herd-boy on the lonely moor: Or he by bards the shepherd hight, Who mourns his maiden's broken tie, Till the sweet plaint, in woe's despite, Hath made a bliss of agony: Sweet power of song! thanks flow to thee From every kind and gentle breast! Let Erin'sâCambria's minstrels be With Burns's tuneful spirit blest! THE BLACK COCK, WRITTEN FOR A WELSH AIR, CALLED âTHE NOTE OF THE BLACK COCK.â Good morrow to thy sable beak, And glossy plumage, dark and sleek, Thy crimson moon and azure eye, Cock of the heath, so wildly shy! I see thee, slily cowering, through That wiry web of silver dew, That twinkles in the morning air, Like casement of my lady fair. A maid there is in yonder tower, Who, peeping from her early bower, Half shows, like thee, with simple wile, Her braided hair and morning smile. The rarest things with wayward will, Beneath the covert hide them still: The rarest things to light of day Look shortly forth, and shrink away. One fleeting moment of delight, I sunn'd me in her cheering sight; And short, I ween, the term will be, That I shall parley hold with thee. Through Snowdon's mist red beams the day; The climbing herdboy chaunts his lay; The gnat-flies dance their sunny ring; Thou art already on the wing! SONG, WRITTEN FOR A WELSH AIR, CALLED âTHE PURSUIT OF LOVE.â O, welcome, bat and owlet gray, Thus winging low your airy way! And welcome, moth and drowsy fly, That to mine ear come humming by! And welcome, shadows dim and deep, And stars that through the pale sky peep! O welcome all! to me ye say, My woodland love is on her way. Upon the soft wind floats her hair; Her breath is in the dewy air; Her steps are in the whisper'd sound That steals along the stilly ground. O dawn of day, in rosy bower, What art thou to this witching hour? O noon of day, in sunshine bright, What art thou to the fall of night? SONG, WRITTEN FOR A WELSH AIR, CALLED âTHE NEW YEAR'S GIFT.â All white hang the bushes o'er Elaw's sweet stream, And pale from the rock the long icicles gleam; The first peep of morning just peers from the sky, And here at thy door, gentle Mary, am I. With the dawn of the year, and the dawn of the light, The one who best loves thee stands first in thy sight, Then welcome, dear maid! with my gift let me beâ A ribbon, a kiss, and a blessing for thee! Last year, of earth's treasures I gave thee my part, The new year before it, I gave thee my heart; And now, gentle Mary, I greet thee again, When only this band and a blessing remain. Though Time should run on with his sack full of care, And wrinkle thy cheek, dear, and whiten thy hair, Yet still on this morn shall my offering be, A ribbon, a kiss, and a blessing for thee. SONG, WRITTEN FOR A WELSH MELODY. I've no sheep on the mountain, nor boat on the lake, Nor coin in my coffer to keep me awake, Nor corn in my garner, nor fruit on my tree, Yet the Maid of Llanwellyn smiles sweetly on me. Softly tapping at eve to her window I came, And loud bay'd the watch-dog, loud scolded the dame; For shame, silly Lightfoot! what is it to thee, Though the Maid of Llanwellyn smiles sweetly on me? The farmer rides proudly to market or fair, The clerk at the alehouse still claims the great chair, But, of all our proud fellows, the proudest I'll be, While the Maid of Llanwellyn smiles sweetly on me. For blythe as the urchin at holiday play, And meek as a matron in mantle of gray, And trim as a lady of gentle degree, Is the Maid of Llanwellyn, who smiles upon me. SONG. What voice is this, thou evening gale! That mingles with thy rising wail; And, as it passes, sadly seems The faint return of youthful dreams? Though now its strain is wild and drear, Blythe was it once as sky-lark's cheerâ Sweet as the night-bird's sweetest song,â Dear as the lisp of infant's tongue. It was the voice, at whose sweet flow The heart did beat, and cheek did glow, And lip did smile, and eye did weep, And motion'd love the measure keep. Oft be thy sound, soft gale of even, Thus to my wistful fancy given; And, as I list the swelling strain, The dead shall seem to live again! ON THE DEATH OF A VERY DEAR FRIEND. A spirit hath pass'd from her breezy hill, From the sound of her trees and her tinkling rill, From her broomy nooks and her twisted bowers, And the splendid show of her cherish'd flowers, As the sun shone out on her garden gay, And dew-drops sparkled on stem and spray; From the peasant's cot, where the housewife neat Prepared for her the oft-wiped seat; From the farmer's hold, where the dame's glad eye Enhanced the parlour courtesy; From the place, above all, she loved the best, That mansion fair, her home of rest, Where inmates dear were ever found And sisterly affection sweetly fenced her round. This spirit, when clothed in mortal weeds, Was full of Christian thoughts and deeds. The simple sound of her well-known voice Made lonely widow'd hearts rejoice; And the sickly hind look'd from his bed As he heard her steps on his threshold tread, And, smiling momently, forgot The pine and pain of his weary lot. Beneath his mistress, frank and kind, Her gardener work'd with willing mind, As though the very flowers would bloom To please her with their rich perfume. And when at times with spud or rake She did his lighter toil partake, Some neighbour's child would slily peep Through wicket-fence, and near her creep, Encouraged by a nod or smile, And by her side chat busily the while; For with such urchin folk right dearly She loved to hold a playful parley. Nor did such toward spots alone declare Her pleasing fancy and her skilful care; The long-neglected quarry, grim and gray, Where rubbish in uncouth confusion lay,â Loose stones and sand with weeds and brush-wood rotten, And everything or worthless or forgotten,â Seem'd to obey her will, as though by duty Constrain'd, and soon became a place of beauty. Its fairy floor is mossy green, And o'er its creviced walls, I ween, The harebell, foxglove, fern, and heather, Mingle most lovingly together; While from the upper screen, as bent to see What might be hid below, the rowan tree And drooping birch seem to look curiously, A friendly place where birds for shelter come, And bees and flies and moths raise a soft summer hum, Justina's Quarry! a name most dear Will henceforth sweetly, sadly soothe the ear. Happy, and making others so, Her life's pure stream did gently flow. Like a warm morning's kindly sheen, Oft was the light of her presence seen Reflected from the brow and eye Of those whose hearts beat quick when she was nigh. Her gentle voice and joyous smile And sprightly converse could beguile The winter's night of half its measure, The rainy day of half its listless leisure. The gifts of fortune were by her possess'd As only held in trust; she felt that best She served her bounteous Master when she gave What He to her had given, His poor to save From pain or penury, and could upbind The suffering body or the wounded mind. How generously her hand bestow'd! How gratefully her bosom glow'd! The God she loved did to her heart His own beneficence impart, And still she thought her gifts too small To prove her gratitude to Him who gave her all. To woe and suffering she clung, And her protecting arms around the helpless flung. But not in gentleness alone The nature of her mind was known; High intellect, acute and strong, Did to this gifted friend belong, In time of need a present aid To comfort, counsel, or persuade, To hold o'er other minds a sway, Ruling their will when seeming to obey. And thus in health and wealth her life she pass'd, But death his stern commission gain'd at last, Empower'd her yet fair earthly robe to rend, And with frail timid nature to contend. But He, the Saviour, whom she loved through life, Had nobly braced her for the fearful strife, And she with mind composed and steadfast eye Could meet the grizzly foe right valiantly. In every interval of pain Her buoyant spirits rose again. At open window she would sit, And see the swallow past her flit, And see the blue sky pure and fair, And white clouds floating in the air, And feel the kindly cooling breeze That stirr'd among the waving trees; Or call some youngling of her race To look upon its lovely face; Then on her sisters sweetly smile, And for a time their woe beguile With cheerful words of other years, While they, belike, sat smiling through their tears. But now, alas! the rathless foe Must deal his final blow; Her brief, but honour'd course is run, Her Christian warfare done. 'Twas then her brightening eyes she raised, And towards heaven intently gazed, As if some beckoning vision there Were hovering in the viewless air. And then her eyelids slowly dropp'd, Her features blanch'd, her pulses stopp'd, And to the blessed realms of brighter day The beautiful spirit hath pass'd away. VERSES ON SACRED SUBJECTS. HYMN. My God! would that, from earthly trammels free, My thoughts could win their upward way to Thee, And there awhile in lofty regions prove The purifying glow of holy love! The solemn dome of night is o'er my head, Where countless stars in grand array are spreadâ Thy mighty host, that to our wond'ring eyes One maze of glory is; while sombre lies Beneath its vasty span the darken'd face Of many a land, where many a motley race, With all their worldly care, in sleep are lapt. O, might my soul, in adoration rapt, Her high concentred thoughts still raise to Thee, With steady power! Alas, this may not be! My thoughts are twilight birds, in seasons rare, That skim, and rise, and flit in nether air; That wheel, and turn, and cross, and soar, and swoop, With seeming bootless speed, then feebly droop Their weary wings, which may no more sustain Such flight, and hie to murky haunts again. My God, who knowst the creature thou hast made, Pity my weakness, nor as sin be laid Upon my head, this feebleness of mind; And if sublimer thoughts I may not bind, As the abiding treasure of my heartâ Inmates, who rarely from their cell depart; Vouchsafe such grace, that many a transient notion May oft within me kindle true devotion; And, moving as a meteor of the night, Be for a passing, glorious moment bright,â A moment, uttering in words of fire, âThou art our Mighty Lord, our good and bounteous Sire!â HYMN. The frith is cross'd, the previous warfare past, Through swampy plains, dark woods and deserts vast, O'er heaths and flowery slopes, and valleys fair, And gloomy mountain passes, steep and bare,â All disembark'd the pilgrims stand On the unknown and beauteous land, While Hope, who needs support no more, Hath dropp'd her anchor by the shore, A strangely mingled band! And lo, with many a lofty dome, Before them stands that ample home, Of many mansions, halls of rest, And heavenly converse for the blest, Where charity and love abide; While through its precincts, fair and wide, Research, and knowledge, and devotion, Together wend with onward motion,â A home to which, the entrance free, Come from all tribes of each degree, And from all lands, the lord, and slave, The firm, the timid, and the brave; The nursling from its mother's arms, The maid in all her early charms, The stately dame, the weary drudge, The priest, the penitent, the panel, and the judge,â The learn'd philosopher, historian sage, And he who could not scan a letter'd page, Who look with wonderment, yet look with love, On their companions, and most sweetly prove The new-born fellowship of blessed souls above. Yea, there do enemies and rivals meet, And with a strange good-will each other greet, Like urchins who in feign'd array, Of war, on school-tide holiday, Have sparr'd and jostled on the green, And for a moment angry been, Yea, feel such presence hath within them given A quicken'd zest even for the joys of heaven; For o'er them charity, like unseen air, Diffusing balmy sweetness every where, Shall softly brood; and minds of every hue, From rosy paleness to empurpled blue, Like the fair rainbow's mingled harmony, Give soften'd splendour to the mental eye. For wisdom, as the generous Saviour said, When peevish censure reckless charges madeâ Wisdom, unshackled, works on every side, And is of all her children justified. The pilgrim crowds advance. But O, that sight Before them opening, beautiful and bright, As lessening distance gives to view Their Father's house, while they pursue Their onward path,âNo! nor by word nor thought, To man's imagination can be brought, That awful glory: cease, vain muser! cease! Bless God in humble hope, and be at peace! HYMN. Almighty God, from whom our being came, To whom it tends, blest be Thy holy name! Blest when through pillar'd aisles we roam, Or kneel beneath the lofty dome, As full o'er-head, and all around, Swell harmonies of long-drawn sound, While storied windows with deep tinctured beam, On chisell'd forms and graven pavements gleam! Blest in the low-brow'd house of prayer, Where homely pews and rafters bare Encompass those, who meekly look Upon the cherish'd, holy book! Blest in the cot where, on the ground, The patriarch peasant kneels with all his family round! But oh! most blest where Thy adorer stands, Within a temple not uprear'd by hands! O'er-canopied by pure ethereal blue, On which fair clouds, of white and silvery hue, In wide array with slow progression range, And varied forms assume in endless change; The granite peak, by storms of ages beat, The pavement is on which he sets his feet, And there a goodly scope surveys, Enlighten'd by the morning rays. Below, distinctly mark'd, are seen, Fields, hamlets, towns, and woodlands green; And then beyond, but less defined, A sweep of hills and vales combined, Where brooding vapours scarce betray Some river winding on its way; And far beyond, by distance made, A fainter line of light and shade, While further still, in distance lost, Lie sea, and shore, and clifted coast,â A vasty circle, dim and pale, Of mortal ken the closing veil. In this Thy Temple, fair and grand, Doth Thine adoring creature stand, His eyes in ecstacy of wonder raising, His glowing, throbbing heart Thy goodness praising, Till tears run coursing down his cheeks, And every thrilling member speaks The one absorbing thought his soul containeth, Of love and awe composed, âthe Lord omnipotent reigneth.â HYMN. What thoughts come to the Christian's aid, Upon a bed of sickness laid, While nightly watchers silence keep, Or close their weary eyes to sleep, When lamp and fagots waste away, As dimly dawns approaching day? âThough here this frame of dust may end, My spirit shall to God ascend, And, for His sake who died to save Poor sinners from a hopeless grave, With all its sins and faults forgiven, A peaceful shelter find in heaven; A Father's house, a home of love: Praised be His name, all praise above! Who, even in ruin, loved us still, And would not soul and body kill! And blessed be His generous Son, Who has for us such mercy won! His gospel sheds a cheering light Upon our darkling way, through dreary night. A gleam falls from a sever'd cloud, Upon the coffin, and the shroud; While, high in air, with buoyant swell, Sounds like a friendly call, the passing bell.â HYMN. My soul! and dost thou faintly shrink, Thus trembling on an awful brink? Or rough, or smooth, but one step more, And thy long pilgrimage is o'er. Thy pilgrim's cloak that clipp'd thee round, Like a sear'd leaf, dropp'd on the ground, A base and mouldering thing shall lie, Its form and uses all gone by. Behind thee, closing darkness all Shall cover, like a midnight pall; Before theeâNo! I may not dare To think, or fancy, what lies there.â Doth the unbodied spirit take its flight, Unto its destined, distant, sphere of light, Upon the buoyant wings of morn, All conscious of its glory borne: Or with an instant transit, make The awful change, and then awake, As from a slumber, sound and deep, A wakes an infant from its sleep, With limbs refresh'd and vigour new A gradual progress to pursue; Allied to infancy, with earthly charms, Once fondled in an elder brother's arms, Who said to men, by worldly passions driven, âLo! such as these possess the realms of heaven.â Or shall it powerful, and at once Start up as from a gloomy trance, With sudden, glorious light astounded, By the blest brotherhood of saints surrounded, Where those, who have been loved and lost, appear With kindred looks of greeting and of cheer? Away, ye pictured thoughts that pass Like figures on a magic glass, Or fitful light with arrowy rays That on the northern welkin plays! A steady gleam that will not flit, Comes from the words of Holy Writ. âEye hath not seen, and ear hath never heard, Nor heart conceived the things by God prepared, For those who love Him.ââO such love impart, Repentant, fervent, and adoring, From every taint of sin restoring, My Father and my God! to this poor heart! HYMN FOR THE SCOTCH KIRK. O God! who madest earth, sea, air, And living creatures, free and fair, Thy hallow'd praise is every where, Hallelujah! All blended in the swelling song, Are wise and simple, weak and strong, Sweet woman's voice and infant's tongue, Hallelujah! Yea, woods, and winds, and waves convey To the rapt ear a hymn, and say âHim who hath made us we obey, Hallelujah!â A SECOND HYMN FOR THE KIRK. Be heaven's almighty King adored, Of all good things the Giver! Sing Hallelujah to the Lord For ever, and for ever! Let closed lips, moved at the word, With glowing accents sever! O Hallelujah to the Lord For ever, and for ever! Can other strains such sounds afford, Of ecstasy? O never! Sing Hallelujah to the Lord, For ever, and for ever! A THIRD HYMN FOR THE KIRK. Up, sluggard soul! awake, and raise To thy blest Lord a song of praise, Who lifts thee from the gloomy grave, When low on earth thou liest,â To Him who lived and died to save, Hosanna in the highest! To Him, thy friend of friends, whose love Invites thee to a home above, When thou, the world's poor outcast slave, In grief and anguish criest,â To Him who lived and died to save, Hosanna in the highest! His love a living stream hath found For pilgrims faint, on barren ground, Their parch'd and languid souls to lave, When earthly streams are dryest,â To Him who lived and died to save, Hosanna in the highest! ST. MATTHEW, v. 9. âBlessed are the peace-makers, for they God's children shall be called!ââso spake The Prince of Peace, in mortal clay, Who veil'd His glory, for our sake. The stormy passions of the mind, The boastful tongue and brow of pride, Their soothing counsels, wise and kind, Make to a gentle calm subside. That eye upon the ground is cast, Which glanced with restless angry glare, That heart to hostile heart is prest, Which thought to place a scorpion there. Contentious tribes upon the ground Cast bow and spear at their charm'd voice, And, link'd in many a friendly round, Will o'er the pledge of peace rejoice. Then flourish fields and gardens gay, Where leaders charged with martial train; And infants 'mid the herbage play, Where lately lay the ghastly slain. Blest are the peace-makers! for they To God's blest family belong; Honour'd in this our earthly lay, And in a sweeter, loftier song. ST.LUKE, XVIII. 16. âLet little children come to me,â Our Lord and Saviour said, As on a humble, harmless brow His gentle hand was laid. The teachable and simple heart Fears not to be beguiled; Who enters heaven must love and trust, E'en as a little child. The mightiest king, the wisest sage, Who knows his God aright, Himself a helpless infant feels In the Almighty's sight. A nursling at his lesson set, Who hopes at last to know, Is the most learn'd of Adam's race, In this our home below. An urchin with his borrow'd rod, Who smites with guided hand, Earth's greatest conqueror hath been The lord of many a land. âLet little children come to me!â A cheering welcome given To all with guileless, humble hearts, Who seek the way to heaven. ST.JOHN, XXI. 1. Toil-worn upon their wavy sea, With empty nets and wasted store, The fishermen of Galilee Are steering cheerless to the shore. But lo! upon the shelving strand, A form like one of Abraham's race, Beckons with friendly outstretch'd hand, Yet moves with more than mortal grace. And words came wafted on the wind,â âFriends, have ye meat?â they answer'd âNone.â âCast to the right and ye shall find,â And to the right their nets were thrown: When all the treasures of the deep Into their meshy cells were pour'd. Who may it may be? within them leap Their yearning heartsââit is the Lord.â So he, traversing life's broad main, Who long hath toil'd and nothing won, Will feel how profitless and vain A worldling's task when it is done! His hands hang listless by his side, With languid eye and gather'd brow, He wanders, hope no more his guide, For what hath she to offer now? But hark, a voice! he turns his head; A treasure rich before him lies; And rays of light from heaven are shed, To gleam the fair unfolded prize. Who doth this better gift impart, Than earth or ocean can afford? O, feel and rouse thee, grateful heart! And gladly own it is the Lord. ST. LUKE, VII. 12. In silent sorrow from the gates of Nain, Bearing their dead, the widow's only son, A band of friends went forth; and with that train E'en she, the most bereft, moved sadly on. But when the Lord beheld the piteous sight, He had compassion on her; from Him broke Soft tenderness of soul, with saving might, And âWeep notâ were the gracious words He spoke. In deep affliction 'tis that voice we hear, When pitying, helpless friends keep silence round: Weep not! there's saving power, there's comfort near, That will e'en in the darkest hour be found. It is an hour of darkest, deepest woe, When those we love are sever'd from our side, Yet weep not, for we soon and surely go Upon their steps, led by the same blest Guide. It is a darken'd hour, when evil fame And evil fortune mingle in our lot; Yet weep not; He, who scorn, rebuke, and shame Bore for our worthless sakes, deserts us not. It is an hour of darkness, when the soul, She knows not why, dreads an impending doom, While heaven and earth seem one black, formless scroll, But weep not, light will yet break through the gloom. Poor soul! He who beheld the widow's grief, And touch'd the bier, and from death's bands set free Her only son, hath for all woes relief, And âWeep notâ are the words He speaks to thee. JOB, XIII. 15. O God, who by Thy boundless might, This earth, heaven's dome and stars of light, Hast form'd in wisdom and in love! Let every human bosom move With grateful thoughts, and gladly raise In swelling notes a psalm of praise! Let high and low, and bond and free, Bless Thy great name, and trust in Thee! This is our strong and steadfast stay, When health and wealth have flown away; When every joy of life is past, Our greatest comfort and our last. When laid upon the bed of death, These thoughts will join our latest breath. âI will, O Lord, though crush'd and spent I be, Yea, though Thou slay me, trust in Thee.â A generous virtue, nobly sprung, Faith towers our inward powers among, Like armed chief, like warrior true, Whose courage nothing can subdue, But bravely combats to the last, Then says with looks high-heavenward cast, âI will, O Lord, in this extremity, E'en though thou slay me, trust in thee.â HYMN. Those Lord, who raise their souls to Thee, Not always sink on bended knee. On earth's vast space of sea and landâ Thy sky-coped temple wide and grand, Swift passing thoughts of praise and prayer To Thee are wafted every where, From grateful hearts, who feel, and love To feel, that 'tis in Thee they live and move. In hours of triumph or of woe; On fortune's sunny heights, or low In gloomy deeps of mortal doom, The quickening thought will swiftly come, As from veil'd heaven the lightning keen Doth pass the sever'd clouds between, And penetrates with equal power The humble cottage or the lordly tower. The marching soldier, stern and stark,â The seaman in his wave-toss'd ark,â The king on guarded throne sustain'd,â The prisoner fetter'd and arraign'd,â Will feel, like links of living fire, Their kindred to a Heavenly Sire, And in their bosoms' secret core, With speechless praise, His mighty name adore. The guileless youth, in halls of pleasure, Whose light feet time the tuneful measure, May, with thrill'd heart and flashing eye, Blend holy thanks with revelry; The very child, at gambols seen With play-mates on the sunny green, Who feels it bliss to be alive, Will to life's Lord a transient worship give. These nature's inward Hallelujahs are, Warm, though with words unclothed; here let them wear Thy robe of woven sounds, sweet harmony, And wend in floating beauty to the sky! A HYMN FOR THE KIRK. O Lord of earth and heaven, Whose love and power have given The solid ground, and floating air, And circling ocean, regions fair, To be the home of moving life, The busy seats of joy and strife,â To Thee with fear and love we raise A song of praise. How many links there be To bind man's heart to Thee; Affections of the human breast For children, kindred, friend, and guest; Yea, those in generous minds that flow From virtues of a noble foe! All form a woven mystic cord,â Thy bands, O Lord; Thy streaming rays of love, That glow in heaven above, And draw the ransom'd soul to Thee, And set it from low thraldom free! As the snared bird, when loosen'd, flies On outspread pinions to the skies, With love that conquers fear, we raise Our song of praise. A HYMN. O Lord supreme, whose works so fair, Sublime and varied, every where The gazing eye delight! Thy wisdom, power, and love, the day Doth in its splendid course display, As doth the glorious night. We look upon the ocean wide, Where ships upon the billows ride, And sea-birds wing the air, And feel, as o'er the blue expanse Soft shadows pass and sunbeams glance, Thy power and love are there: And also on the checker'd land, Where mountain peaks, and forests grand, With peopled plains between, And rising slow from man's abode The grey smoke on its heavenward road, In fair array are seen. Thus day and night, and land, and sea, Each in its turn, O Lord! of thee Speaks to the mental ear: And still the thoughts that they impart Are, to the Christian Pilgrim's heart, Most cherish'd and most dear. SELECT VERSES FROM THE 147TH PSALM. Praise ye the Lord with cheerful voice, In swelling strains His praises sing, It makes the grateful heart rejoice, It is a blest and pleasant thing. He who the broken heart doth brace, And bindeth up the wounded frame, Numbers the host through heaven's vast space, And gives to every star its name. With fleecy clouds he clothes the sky, He stores the moisten'd earth with good, From him the ravens when they cry, And savage beasts receive their food. He sends afar His high behests, Which sea and land with blessings fill; Swift flies His word, no power arrests The course of His almighty will. THOUGHTS TAKEN FROM THE 93RD PSALM. Clothed in majesty sublime, And girt with strength th' Almighty reigns; And, through the wreckful course of time, His hand the steadfast world sustains. Wide doth the mighty thunder fill The darken'd earth with dread dismay, But mightier far is He whose will The lightning and the storm obey. Deep, heaving under land and sea, The earthquake uttereth his sound, Awful though low; more awful He Who holds its rage in prison bound. The powerful billows, huge and grand, Rise swelling from the troubled main, More powerful is the powerful hand That doth their threatening rage restrain. O Lord, adored! from race to race, Men shall thy righteous laws proclaim, And holiness become the place Call'd by Thy great and glorious name. AHALYA BAEE: A POEM. A voice from Sinai's sacred summit came, What time, enrobed and hid in smoke and flame, Israel's assembled hosts the wonder saw From its extended base, a sight of awe, In stilly silence waiting to behold What dreadful vision'd change it might unfold; With up-cast, pallid faces, shrunk with fear, They stood, the awful words of God to hear: They heard and felt that Israel's God alone Is Lord of heaven and earth, and shares His power with none. The terrors of that awful day, though past, Have on the tide of time their glory cast: As when the sun, whom cloudy state conceals, From his pavilion's curtain'd side reveals Some scatter'd rays, that, through the general gloom, Headland, or tower, or desert rocks illume; So did that mighty revelation throw, O'er Prophets, Judges, Seers, a feeble glow Of pure religious light, and Judah's king With psalms of praise made his struck harp to ringâ A soul-reviving light, that did impart Devotion's warmth to many a noble heart; Till He appear'd, in whom God's Spirit dwelt, Unmeasured, and for helpless mortals felt More than a brother's love, whose majesty, Subdued and mild, struck not man's garish eye. His mien, His motions, spoke of inward loveâ His blessed words and acts of power above All human excellence;âtill, in the eternal name, The Son of God, the Son of Man, the Son of David came. But deem not that the Parent of mankind, Maker of all, hath to one race confined The gifts His blessed Spirit can bestow On all Earth's scatter'd nations here below. His revelations to a chosen race With pow'r were manifested, yet we trace In the bewilder'd heathen's heart, who bows To Idols dumb, and pays devoted vows To Wood and Stone, a conscious inward feeling Of higher things o'er heart and fancy stealing; Perhaps a sudden quickening thought Across his musings strangely brought; Ay, then God's Spirit with his soul is dealing. And have not the philosopher and sage, The generous and good of every age, In silent hours of meditation high, Contemplating the sun, the stars, and sky, The earth, the ocean,âall that bounteous store Of fair and good,âbeen strengthen'd to adore One Mighty Lord, and Parent of all good: Nature's own worship, not to be withstood By partial rites which heathen power imposed? And have not those to other minds disclosed Their elevated thoughts, and held communion With kindred minds,âa blest, ennobling union? 'Mid shepherd hordes, for ever changing Their tented-homes, o'er deserts ranging; 'Mid seamen on the ocean bred; 'Mid bandits fierce on plunder fed; Wherever mental light hath shone In circling darkness, bright and lone, As beacon on a distant hill This message beams, though hush'd and still The midnight air broods on the ear,â âGird on your mail, the foe is near!ââ It is a mission'd light from heaven, By the Almighty Father given, And hath its sacred mission well fulfill'd, Although its path to trace we mortals are unskill'd. Behold that female form so meekly bending O'er a pale youth, who is the night-air rending With many a sudden shriek, and many a cry And lengthen'd groan of utter misery! It is a regent Mother, one whose fate By heav'n is fix'd to rule a warlike state; Who, by the laws or custom of the land, Appointed is to hold supreme command. Yet one of gentle mind, who had been meet On Sion's hill to sit at her Redeemer's feet, And listen to His words with humble love, And see His looks benign her pious heart approve. But she hath been in heathen darkness nursed, Hath been with much misguiding lore accursed, Which with the worship of one God supreme Had woven in full many an odious dream. Vague and perplexing seem'd her future doom: Her present world is dark, and darker that to come. Close in her own his burning hands she press'd, And to some pow'r unseen were words like these address'd.â âLeave him, fierce Spirit of th' unhallow'd dead! O, let him rest awhile his wretched head! O, quit possession of his wasted frame! Nor with his lips and alter'd voice blaspheme To bring down blasting vengeance from the skies; Upon him now enough of misery lies. He slew thee wrongfully, and for that deed Remorse has dealt to him a fearful meed. It was the sudden act of jealous youth:â He was deceived, and could not know the truth. But he has tried to make amends; rich stores He on thy widow and thy children pours. An honourable tomb shall give to fame With graven record thy unsullied name. O from this wretched body, Spirit dire! Come forth; what does thy fell revenge require? Can all his misery, can all his pain, E'er make thyself a living man again?â Thus day and night full many tears she shed, And watch'd, and pray'd, and struggled by his bed, Where'er his fiercest, wildest fits prevail'd; But neither watching, prayers, nor tears avail'd. At length deep silence through the palace reign'd, And for a solemn term its rule maintain'd. The dire disease its cruel task hath done; The princely stripling's mortal course is run. What lamentations, mingled, loud, and shrill, Did courts and halls and stately chambers fill, Bursting from that deep silence and repose, We say not, but the scene of sadness close. The corse is on its pile consumed, The bones within their urn inhumed. But the sad Mother, so bereft, Had she no tie of comfort left? Yes, heaven extremes of woe restrain'd; One little daughter yet remain'd. She to console her Mother tried, And play'd and prattled by her side. Her own soft cheek to hers she laid, And simple words of kindness said Right coaxingly, that sometimes broke The spell of grief; a gentle stroke Slow sliding down her mother's arm, Repeated oft, work'd like a charm; Then would her dark eyes glance around To see what farther comfort might be found. With feather'd fan she cool'd her brow, And when the tears began to flow, Her small hand plied its kerchief well, And softly wiped them as they fell. Her fingers next, belike, would try The Rany's raven-locks in braids to tie, That, like torn, tangled wreaths, from altars flung, Dishevell'd, o'er her stooping shoulders hung. Ay, every simple, youthful, winning art This gentle creature used to soothe the wounded heart. Nor was that simple ministry in vain; Her Mother's heart was soothed, and she again Caress'd her little Maid, as heretofore, And dearly loved her in her bosom's core. But Brahma to her care consign'd A family of far other kind,â Of various casts a mingled brood, Dull and untoward, fierce and rude; And she must brace her for the task, Nor leave of tend'rer passions ask. Offers of large possessions to resign The right of sov'reignty did she decline Indignantly, with duty still in view To her own house and to her people true; And gave effect to her determination With prompt display of warlike preparation. Each soldier of her race, with glancing eyes, Upon her elephant's arm'd howdah spies Quivers with arrows stored, and bows unstrung, Just ready for the bend in order hung, That to their warm devoted hearts declare, She will with them their fate and dangers share. Yet, in his place, whose hapless race is run, She must adopt another heir and son, That in his settled right she still may guide The councils of the state,âmay still preside, The careful regent Mother, over all, And to her aid, troops, chieftains, Brahmins call. And hath she chosen wilily An Infant on the Nurse's knee, Whose lengthen'd nonage may maintain O'er subject lands her settled reign, As prudent Ranies who pursue One selfish end are wont to do? O no; her noble nature spurn'd Such narrow thoughts; her choice she turn'd Upon a soldier tried and brave, Faithful of heart, and firm to save The country from all threaten'd wrong By hostile Rajahs fierce and strong; Of generous nature too, who fought Beneath a woman's rule, nor sought Undue extension of his power, Her active champion, till her dying hour. He call'd her Mother, though his life had run More years by far than hersâa true and noble son. Of holkar's valiant race was he, Though somewhat distant in degree. But no suspicions e'er found way To her most generous mind, which lay In steady confidence, reposing On his tried worth, nor once disclosing, By word or look, an inward doubt Of his fidelity throughout A lengthen'd course of years, in which he served Nobly his noble Dame, nor from strict duty swerved. They were a state-constructed Son and Mother, A blessed twain, each worthy of the other; United firmly to their native land, She the considerate head, and he the ready hand. War on her distant frontiers never ending, Was waged by chiefs for booty still contending E'en more than power; but round her seat of sway, Peaceful and bright, a charmed circle lay. There she the even scales of justice held, And all oppressive wrong and faction quell'd. There to her subjects, of whate'er degree, It was, I trow, a joyous sight to see Their noble Baee her seat of judgment fill, Dispensing justice with impartial skill. They gather'd round her unrestrain'd, Buoyant and happy if they gain'd Such words of her sonorous speech, As might their distant station reach, Some looks of meaning from her eye While perjured knaves, belike, would try A simple statement to perplex, The poor unwary hind to vex. And, if no better they might have, E'en o'er the crowd to see her wave Her little hand with queenly grace, Warm'd the good Ryot's heart and gleam'd his dusky face. The children raised a joyous cry, When from afar they could descry Her palanquin so gay and bright, By coolies borneâa burden light! And cluster'd in the narrowest lane To see her pass with all her train; And urchins dared aloud to call, âShe is our Mother, and she loves us all.â The Parish, or the meanest hind, Did to her presence access find; To her might tell with much detail His wearisome and lengthy tale, Circuitous and slow, nor fear To tire her patient ear. But when she question'd him again To make the knotted matter plain, Away would awe and caution wend; He felt conversing with a friend. And her shrewd mind, the while, quick to discern The human character, did useful knowledge learn. Woe, want, and suff'ring to assuage, Would still her daily thoughts engage; On this her mind was most intent; She knew she was by Brahma sent; For works of mercy, by her hand To be dispensed through all the land, He had committed to her care, Nor might she toil nor trouble spare. She thought upon the pilgrim's woes, Who over plain and mountain goes, His sinking steps, his visage gaunt, And eager glare of hungry want, His still increasing hourly pain, Ere he may reach his Idol's distant fane. She thought upon wayfaring strangers, Braving of wood and wild the dangers, Who yet by thirst subdued are found Stretch'd fainting on the parched ground. She thought of age and infancy Left on the river's brink to die: Yea, e'en on animals her thoughts would dwell, Who have no words their sufferings to tell. And still to kindly thoughts succeed Full many a charitable deed; Her agents watch'd the pilgrim's track, To give him what his need might lack; From river's weedy margin took the child, And bade the aged live in accents mild. They caravanseras would build, Poor strangers from the night to shield, And many a well and cooling tank Upon the traveller's route they sank. The thirsty oxen in the plough, See help at hand, and stop to bow Their heads unto the trough beneath, And drink the welcome draught with seething, long-drawn breath. Upon her heart they had their claim, Yea, Ahalya Baee e'en cared for them. And here with humble zeal I must disclose A further bounty, strange, belike, to those, Who in a better, purer faith were born: Yet pause awhile, I pray, and check your scorn; Ye who acknowledge freely your descent From those, in former days, who humbly bent At shrines of many a carved and gilded saintâ Ay, saints who when their earthly race was run, Full many a black and ruthless deed had done; Will ye despise the simple blinded zeal Which now my truthful legend must reveal? Water in vessels closely pent, From Ganges' sacred waves she sent The holy idols to bedew, And at their shrines her vows would oft renew. Brahma supreme o'er all above, She did as humble daughter love; And other gods, set by his will O'er Hindus' race for good or ill, She would invoke, at needful hours, Subordinate but awful powers. Fell powers, who ruled in nether air, Who bade War's weapons kill or spare; Sent pestilence, all human joy To blast, to poison, and destroy,â Those still she tried her friends to make, For her own weal, and for her people's sake. With wise and learned Brahmins to converse, To hear them many lines of lore rehearse; And from the sacred shasters to recite Maxims, and rules, and laws, was her delight; And many a solemn, wide-sleeved sage, I ween, Was in her special courtly circle seen, Mingled with stately chiefs of high degree, And watchful, wary scribes, and merchants free. But ne'er a Brahmin of them all Could win her for his blinded thrall, Could e'er her noble mind persuade To do what inward rectitude forbade. And if from district far or near, Some fact of ruthless rapine reach'd her ear, Or base oppression to the poor, Who must too oft such grievous wrong endure, How quickly did her alter'd brow, Her inward indignation show! Nor durst the boldest culprits dare To front her presence; and if there They were at her imperious call assembled, The bravest chief and holiest Brahmin trembled. Her countenance, so mild by nature, Grew sternly fix'd in ev'ry feature; Her dark eye flash'd like kindled leven Sent from a rifted cloud of heaven; Her stature low and figure slight, Strangely dilated grew, and grand, Like ruling spirit of the night, Through misty vapour seen, by some benighted band. Her voice, whose tones so kindly sweet, Made widows' hearts with gladness beat, Is now a sound of awe and fear, Swelling like onward thunder to the ear; In sooth, a strange, unwonted sound to hear! It was her solace and her pride O'er peaceful districts to preside, And keep around, remote or nigh, Her country in prosperity. Erewhile, her blessed reign before, It was a country to deplore; Where war and bloodshed, want and strife, Had made a hell for human life. Chiefs were by turns, or weak or strong, All interlaced in deeds of wrong; Fiercely attacking town and village, And fenced forts for sordid pillage; Treasure they did so vainly reap, Which all could gain, but none could keep. He who to-day had home and hold, Grain on his fields, sheep in his fold, To-morrow with his family fled, And had not where to lay his head. He who to-day hath kept his state In princely hall where menials wait, May soon in ruin'd haunts abide, Or in the perilous jungle hide, Where foul and fair are side by side; A place of fear and admiration. There The brindled tiger in his reedy lair, Purrs gruffly, while aloft is singing The Loorie gay, on light spray swinging; There oft the baleful snake is seen, Through flow'ry slopes and thickets green, Where roses blush and blossoms blow, And lilies sweet profusely grow, Moving his sluggish, loathly length, Then rearing up his stiffen'd strength, At moving prey to take his aim, And swathe and crush the vital frame. Horsemen and spearmen o'er the plains In dusky masses moved, while trains Of heavy cannon in the rear, By harness'd bullocks dragg'd, appear; And high, belike, above the crowd, Upon his elephant some chieftain proud, Sits stately, though less rational in nature Than that on which he rides,âa noble sapient creature. But now, how changed! Upon the frontiers far Her brave adopted son waged ceaseless war With every restless robber-chief, who dared Her rightful boundary to invade, and spared The centre districts. Peaceful, still, and bright, They gleam'd on the admiring stranger's sight, Like green oases of some desert land, Encircled round with brown and barren sand; As many learned travellers endite Who of far distant countries love to write: For all, within the guarded girdle bound, Were peace and wealth, content and comfort found. The Ryot plough'd his native soil,â His Father's fields, a pleasing toil; Who, as he guides his sturdy steers, With kindly voice their labour cheers; For well he knows the produce will In season due his garner fill,â Will, on his quiet, daily board Food for his mate and little ones afford. Beside her door the Matron stands And deftly draws, with busy hands, The snowy yarn from distaff tall, For turban fine, or gorgeous shawl. The weaver plies his useful trade, In humid cell beneath the shade, Through the strain'd warp his shuttle throws, And as his web more lengthy grows, Thinks of the golden price that will be paid When in the throng'd bazaars its beauty is display'd. In flow'ry nooks the children play, Or through the shady copses stray In quest of fruit; while from the bough Offended monkeys grin and mow. The gentle lady, all bedight, In gilded palanquin so bright, Goes forth secure, on visit kind Or ceremonious, to some distant friend; Nor fears that on her lengthen'd way She may become some lurking bandit's prey. But wherefore needless words increase? With wise and equal rule the land was bless'dâand peace. But who through life's uncertain day hath run With still, o'er head, a clear unclouded sun; When noon is past he hears the tempest roar, And on his shoulders pelting torrents pour. The weary pilgrim rests him void of fear, Unwitting of the lurking tiger near. The loaded raft floats smoothly on the tide, Though fatal rocks beneath the waters hide; And when the steersman thinks he nears the shore A stroke is felt,âthey sink, and rise no more. Our Rany, as this legend soothly said Had, for her solace sweet, a little Maid. Her after-lot was bright; one happy scene Of married love her easy life had been. But now, alas! her happiness is flown; Death has o'er all his sable mantle thrown. Who now are seen within that spacious room, Where rests an ominous and dismal gloom? She, seated by yon deck'd and rose-strew'd bier, Who neither heaves a sigh nor sheds a tear; She stooping over her and gently speaking, To stem her wayward sorrow vainly seeking! The one is Ahalya's widow'd child; The other is herself, composed and mild, Trying the fatal purpose to avertâ Composed, indeed, but with a bleeding heart. Ay, all in vain her gentle words; for hear What words of woe the tardy answers bear âO Mother, do not grieve me so, My lot is cast and I must go. Shall Jeswunt Row, my noble mate, On pyre be laid in lonely state, While I, who was the only flower He watch'd and cherish'd in his bower, A craven wife shall from the brink Of love's last trial meanly shrink? Forbid it, Brahma, Lord above! Forbid it, faithfulness and love!ââ âAnd dost thou think that Brahma's will I did not righteously fulfil, When I, bereft and sad, did strive Thy noble father to survive? And was not his high blessing pour'd On one so sever'd from her lord? And characters, distinct and fair, Did his approval well declare, When flourishing beneath my sway My people and my kingdom lay. Yes; though a widow so bereft, My heart had other blessings left. But still, as cell'd within my breast, Thou wast my dearest and my best; Thou wast as my own youngling still, Who didst my first affections fill. And wilt thou leave me sad and lone? How shall I live when thou art gone? Whom shall I fondly love and trust? O, do not bow me to the dust!ââ âO no! committed to thy care, Thou hast thy children every where, Their daily benefits will be The comfort Brahma sends to thee. And, dearest mother! thou art oldâ Thy grains of life will soon be told; And what to me will then remain? My Lost will ne'er return again! I through these lonely rooms shall roam A living thing, whose heart hath with the dead its home. Then, best and dearest, to my passion bend, And let my sorrows have an honour'd end!ââ âAn honour'd end will close her life, Who was a good and faithful wife; Die when she will, the funeral flame Gives but a fruitless fleeting fame.ââ âI seek not fame, O say not so! O, add not agony to woe! Life would be death to me, and worse: The inward working of remorse Would make my day as darkness seem, My haunted night a fearful dream. For then he would be ever near, And his upbraiding eyes appear To glare upon a wife, whose love Could not one moment rise above Base fears, but from her last sad duty started And left his lonely bier unhonour'd and deserted.â All interchange of words were vainâ The Rany answer'd not again; But long fix'd looks of anguish fell Upon her daughter's face, and well Spoke that which language could not tell; While actions too did piteously entreat, The mother kneeling at her daughter's feet:â But all in vain; nought may arrest The purpose of her wounded breast. The parent bent her to the cruel blow, And left the dismal chamber, sad and slow; And, closely shut within her secret bower, With humble penitence and prayer Did her afflicted soul prepare For the approaching, dreadful hour: Her prayers were heard, and mercy gave A stinted strength the dreadful hour to brave. That hour is come; and from the palace gate There issues forth in melancholy state, A gorgeous pageant.âStandards borne on high, Moved by the fanning air, arrest the eye, On which devices, traced in colours gay, Emblems of ranks and races make display. First portly Brahmins, sombre and profound, Walk, loosely robed, with eyes cast on the ground. Next turban'd chiefs, with fierce and warlike mien, Cinctured with shawls and flashing arms, are seen; Then high authorities, the letter'd scribe, And mission'd men from many a different tribe, Move slowly on, all ranged in sad array, Proceeding on their mournful, destined way, With heavy steps, that from the ground Send up a muffled, sullen sound. Then doth from portal-arch appear, Circled by friends, the stately bier, On which the princely corse is laid, In rich and splendid robes array'd, Whose features, like to chisel'd stone, Do still an awful beauty own. The crowd on him intently gaze And deeply murmur words of praise. Anon they drop their eyes to find The youthful widow, close behind. She moved, with brow and step sedate, As one who of her lifeless mate Alone had conscious thoughts, and she Worthy appear'd his mate to be. But when by priestly Brahmins, stern and strong, They saw their own loved Rany led along, On her at once all eager eyes were turn'd, And grateful sympathy within each bosom burn'd: Their inward sorrow broke through all restraint, And all around a loud and mingled wailing sent. Now onward as the long procession goes, A different mournful harmony arose From many instruments, whose mingled sound Is floating on the air, and rising from the ground. But when it reach'd the fatal spot, All soft excitement was forgot; A deep and solemn pause ensued, Silence with strange mysterious awe embued. Alas! what measured words can tell The anguish of their last farewell, When that young widow with that Mother parted? From the intense embrace the younger started, As if afraid. Her failing steps sustain'd The bier of death she has already gain'd, Hath on her lap with gentle kindness placed The lifeless head, and its cold form embraced. To the heap'd pile the torch hath been applied, And from between the fagots are descried Pale curving streams of smoke, that wind and sweep, Coil and uncoil, like serpents waked from sleep, Then broadening and ascending hang on high, A dusky, fearful canopy; While pointed tongues of flame below Burst forth: and soon one general glow Involves, in fierce consuming fire, Roaring and red, the funeral pyre. Then drum and trumpet, cymbal, gong, And stringed viols, harsh and strong, Discordant minstrelsy, begin To raise a loud and deaf'ning din; While faintly come to fancy's ear Shrieks from the burning bier. Ay, there are dismal shrieks I wot, But from the flames proceeding not. 'Tis Ahalya in despair, Who, though by friendly force restrain'd Convulsively hath freedom gain'd, And beats her breast and tears her hair. Her gnashing teeth and bleeding hand Too plainly show that self-command Is from her princely spirit taken, Of all its wonted power forsaken. And pause we here! That noble mind To dull unconsciousness was for awhile consign'd. But heaven's all merciful and potent Lord To health of mind the Rany soon restored. He raised again her drooping head; From him received, as from the dead, The people saw their noble Dame, And bade her hail with loud and long acclaim. Still wasteful war, though raging round, Within her precincts was not found, The husbandman scarce turn'd his ear Some far-off tale of love to hear, How bandits, on the distant border, With bandits strove in wild disorder; Where sordid chiefs to robbers turn'd, Made might their right, and justice spurn'd: What cares he for their ceaseless coil? She lives and reigns who will protect his toil. In sooth, o'er all the watch she kept, And waked, and thought, when others slept. When early dawn appear'd, she rose, Nor longer would indulge repose, But to herself (for she could read) Grave books perused. Then would succeed Hours of reflection and of pray'r, That cleared her mind and soothed her care; And oft her day, so well begun, An easy, prosp'rous course would run. Herself sagacious, firm, and just, She put in others gen'rous trust; And when their merit well was proved, Her ministers she ne'er removed. With all the Rajah pow'rs of ev'ry nation, From time to time, she held communication: Could points of policy with art contest, But ever loved the simple method best. And in good sooth, to reason cool, The simplest was the wisest rule. For who would venture to gainsay Or doubt the faith of Ahaly a Baee? To death at last the mission'd power was given To call her hence; her earthly ties were riven. Through all the land a woeful wailing went, From cot to cot, from town to village sent; A tender woe, like which there is no other,â Bereaved children weeping for a mother. Her life and reign were closed in glory, And thus concludes my Legend's faithful story. For thirty yearsâher reign of peaceâ The land in blessings did increase; And she was bless'd by every tongue, By stern and gentle, old and young. And where her works of love remain, On mountain pass, on hill or plain, There stops the traveller awhile, And eyes it with a mournful smile, With muttering lips, that seem to say, âThis was the work of Ahalya Baee.â The learned Sage, who loves to muse, And many a linked thought pursues, Says to himself, and heaves a sigh For things to come and things gone by, âO that our restless chiefs, by misery school'd, Would rule their states as that brave woman ruled!â Yea, even children at their mothers' feet, Are taught such homely rhyming to repeat:â âIn better days, from Brahma came, To rule our land, a noble Dame; Kind was her heart, and bright her fame, And Ahalya was her honour'd name!â THE END.</field>
