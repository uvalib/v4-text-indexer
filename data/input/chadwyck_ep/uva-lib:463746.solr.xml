      <field name="fulltext">[Loe this is he whose infant Muse begann] Loe this is he whose infant Muse begann To braue the World before yeares stil'd him Man; Though praise he sleight &amp; scornes to make his Rymes Begg fauors or opinion of the Tymes, Yet few by good men haue bine more approu'd None so vnseene, so generally lou'd S?. T. I. TO The Reader upon these POEMES. These Iuvenilia (or these youth-pastimes) Set forth in homely and unpolish't Rhimes, Let none despise: for whatsoere they seeme They have their fate, their use, and their esteeme. And will be read; when those more seeming wise, Have farre lesse use and shorter Destinies. Nor read you them, with that Censorious eye, As if you look't for curiou'st Poesey. If that be sought for others can afford Large volumes, and with Art far better stor'd. And this our Author answers our desire, If for his riper labours you enquire. Here you shall see what Nature could impart, E'er he had Time or Meanes, to compasse Art: What straines a native honesty could reach; What knowledge and, what boldnesse it can teach: And, that in Truth a Majestie there is, Though masked in despised simplenesse. Among the Learn'd, this Author hath no name, Nor did he this way thinke to purchase Fame; For when he this composed it was more, Then he had read in twice twelve Moneths before. And by his latter Studies, some discerne, That first he writ and then began to learne. Be't what it will; tis that he meanes shall passe, To shew how foolish, and how wise he was. No Criticke now doth in these Poemes see, A blemish or a scape more soone than he. He knowes as well as they, what seemes amisse In these inventions, and what childish is. He knowes how farre they differ from those Layes, By which the learned Poet hunts for praise: And wherein those absurdities doe lie, Which to their thinking marre his Poesie. And yet he will not mend them: For his name I loved more and higher flies his Fame, By these despised Numbers than their pride Can raise them yet, who did his lines deride. And that his Matter will be priz'd he knowes; When their fil'd language out of fashion growes. Thus therefore uncorrected and untrim'd, You have these Poemes, as they first were limb'd: Which (though some may dislike) some wil approve. For many men will leave a pruned Grove, And curious Garden-Allies, to goe see, What pleasures in untilled Mountaines be: And much delights in Woods to take the shade, Of artlesse Arbors, by rude Nature made. Beside; as there be many men who long To see of what complexion being young Their bodies were, and to that purpose save, Vnalter'd those their Pictures which they have. So, he thus having drawne (as here you find) In childish yeeres the picture of his Minde, Vnalter'd leaves it that in time to come It may appeare how much he changeth from The same he was: And that beseene it may, How he amends, growes worse, or keepes a stay. Then whether he could better this or no, His purpose is some other way to show. ABUSES STRIPT and VVHIPT: OR, SATYRICALL ESSAYES. ??????? ??? ?? ????? ???? ??????????? ????. Despise not this, what ere I seeme in show: A foole to purpose speakes sometime you know. To himselfe, G. W. wisheth all Happinesse. To Time. Epigr. 1. Now swift devouring, bald and ill-fac't Time. Dost not thou blush to see thy selfe uncloak't? Oh that I knew but how to laugh in Rime! Faith I would doe it, though thou wish't me choakt. Didst thou but see how thy faire antique shape, Is now transformed to a shapelesse hew: How like thou look'st to some Barbarian Ape, And could'st thine owne deformities ore-view, Thou would'st be Metamorphosed anew, Run quite away, and either all amend; Or wish thy selfe, and all things at an end. And yet despaire not Time, though thou art ill; (The worst that o'er (I thinke) was knowne to be,) Thou shalt not thus deform'd, continue still, For I much better dayes, yet hope to see. When Vice, and Wrong, and Malice, acted haye, Their furious parts upon confusions stage; Faire Vertue shall be raised from her grave, And bring along with her a golden age, Then we will laugh to scorne the worlds vaine rage. And sit and tell with joy, what stormes are past. And what faire daies we hoped for at last. Epigram. 2. I heare that some aske how I dare so plaine, Taxe the Abuses that I now see raigne; I muse as much they dare say ill unto it, Or dare to aske me how I dare to doe it. 3. To the Stranger. Thou that wert so unhappy first to breath Without the compasse of great Britaines power And blest againe that Fate did thee bequeath, The knowledge of so rich a tongue as our; If (understanding) thou dost hap to read This Booke, wherein thou secst my Nations shame, Yet doe not thou against my Countrey plead; For thine (thou know'st) doth merit greater blame: Our faults are many, this indeed is true; But were they moe; we are no worse than you. 4. To the Satyro-mastix. Oh Lord Sir, y'are deceiv'd; I'm none of those That write in Anger or malicious spleene; I have not taken Pepper in the Nose, Nor base inventer of false libels beene. Such ones there be indeed such I have seene; I envy no man for his greatnesse; I, Nor seeke I any honest mans disgrace: I joy in every ones prosperity; I'l not the credit of a dogge deface, My adversary shall not prove the case. Then stand back (sirrah Whip-jack) with your scourge Doe not incense my Satyr for thy life: Hee's patient enough unlesse thou urge, Contentions now a daies are growne too rife, And He, is very backward unto strife. If you esteeme your peace provoke not me. For whilst I finde good cause and reason why, In spight of all that foes to Satyrs be; He shall (if I list) taxe iniquity, And tis a matter of necessity. What? you would faine have all the Great ones freed; They must not for their vices be controld. Beware; that were a saucinesse indeed: But i the Great ones to offend be bold, I see no reason but they should be told. Yea and they shall; their faults most hurtfull be, And (though I will not put them to that shame) No great injustice in it I did see, If they were taxed by their proper name. For no sin can on earth have her full blame. Then Scourge of Satyrs hold thy whip from mine Or I will make my rod, lash thee and thine. To the gald Reader. Sir, he that's night-gald, or hath cornes on's toes; May blame the Shoomaker and curse his shooes, But those that are acquainted with the fault, Can tell the reason wherefore he doth halt: So thou maist think (perpaps) these Satyrs sting thee, Where only thine own guiltinesse doth wring thee. For if thou wert from these diseases free, Thou would'st be quiet as some others be. But 'tis well knowne a ticklish beast hath ticks: And the old Proverbe saith A gald Iade kicks. But I'l advise thee; if thou feele it smart, Be rul'd by mee and play not the fooles part; Keep't to thy selfe, and there are few shrill know If thou art touched in this Booke or no. Thou seest thou neither art mark't out nor nam'd; And therefore onely to thy selfe art sham'd: Now if thou stirre, at best thou shalt but make The Countrey of thy faults more knowledge take: And (as indeed it justly may) divine, The worst faults that I write against are thine. Then sith to be reproved seemes a curse, And to be moved makes the matter worse, Either to amend thy wicked life have care, Or like a pack-horse and an Asse still beare. To the impartiall Author. George, I did ever thinke thy faithfull breast Contain'd a minde beyond the common sort; Phy very looke and honest heart exprest, And seem'd an awfull mildnesse to import. Poets may vaunt of smooth and lofty straines; Thine with thy subject fitly doe agree. But then thy Muse a better praise obtaines, For whilst the greatest but Time-pleasures be, Thou unappald and freely speak'st the truth; Not any one for feare or lucre sparing: A vertue rare in age more rare in youth; Another Cato but I thinke more daring. Well maist thou speed in these tempestuous times; Thou soone beginst to make the world thy foe, Yet I so well doe like thine honest Rimes, That I could wish all Poets would write so: For thou the way of truth so rightly tend'st, I hold them double prais'd whom thou commend'st. Thy deare friend, Th. C. THE FIRST BOOK THE OCCASION of this WORKE. When nimble time that all things over-runs Made me forsake my tops and eldren guns, Reaching those yeeres in w?? the schoole-boyes brag, In leaving off the bottle and the bag: The very Spring before I grew so old, That I had almost thrice five Winters told; Noting my other fellow-pupils hast, That to our English Athens flockt so fast: Lest others for a Truant should suspect me, That had the selfesame Tutor to direct me, And in a manner counting it a shame To under-goe so long a Schoole-boyes name, Thither went I. For though I'l not compare With many of them that my fellowes were; Yet to my Teachers praise (I speake it now) I all the formes in schoole had quite run through, And was no whit, for Grammer Rules to seeke, In Lillies Latine, nor in Camdens Greeke; But so well grounded, that another day, I could not with our idle Students say For my excuse, I was not enter'd well, For that I was so, can my fellowes tell. And therefore since I came no wiser thence; I must confesse it was my negligence: Yet daily longing to behold and see The places where the sacred Sisters be; I was so happy, to that Foard I came Which of the laboring Oxe doth beare the name, It is a spring of knowledge that imparts A thousand severall Sciences and Arts, A pure cleare Fount, whose water is by ods Farre sweeter than the Nectar of the Gods: Or rather (truly to entitle it) It is the wholesome nurcery of Wit. There once arriv'd, in yeeres and knowledge raw, I fell to wondring at each thing I saw: And for my learning made a month's Vacation, In noting of the places situation, The Palaces and Temples that were due Vnto the wise Minervaes hallowed crew, Their Cloysters, Walks, &amp; Groves; all which survei'd, And in my new admittance well apaid; I did (as other idle Freshmen doe) Long to goe see the Bell of Osney too: And yet for certainty I cannot tell That e'er I dranke at Aristotles Well. And that perhaps may be the reason why I know so little in Philosophy. Yet old Sir Harry Bath was not forgot, In the remembrance of whose wondrous shot The Forrest by (Believe it they that will) Was nam'd Shot-over, as we call it still. But having this experience, and withall, Atchiev'd some cunning at the Tennis-ball; My Tutor (telling me I was not sent To have my time, there vaine and idly spent) From childish humours gently cal'd me in, And with his brave instructions did begin To teach, and by his good perswasion sought To bring me to a love of what he taught. Then after that he labour'd to impart, The hidden secrets of the Logicke Art; In stead of Grammar rules he read me then, Old Scotus, Seton, and new Keckerman. He shew'd me which the PrÃ¦dicables be, As Genus, Species, and the other three: So having said enough of their contents; Handles in order th' ten PrÃ¦dicaments; Next Post-prÃ¦dicamenta with Priorum, Perhermenias and Posteriorum. He with the Topickes opens; and descries Elenchi, full of subtile fallacies: These to unfold (indeed) he tooke much paine, But to my dull capacity in vaine: For all he spake was to as little passe, As in old time unto the vulgar was The Latine Masse, which (whether bad or good) The poore unlearned never understood; But of the meaning were as farre to seeke, As Coriats horse was of his masters Greeke, When in that tongue he made a Speech unto him; That he the greatnes of his strength might shew him. For I his meaning did no more conjecture, Than if he had beene reading Hebrew Lecture. His Infinites, Individuities, Contraries, and Subcontrarieties, Divisions, Subdivisions, and a crew Of tearmes and words, such as I never knew, My shallow understanding so confounded, That I was gravell'd, like a ship that's grounded; And in despaire the Mystery to gaine, Neglecting all tooke neither heed nor paine. Yea, I remain'd in that amazed plight, Till Cynthia six times lost her borrowed light: But then asham'd to finde my selfe still mute, And other little dantiprats dispute, That could distinguish upon Rationale, Yet scarcely heard of Verbum Personale; Or could by heart (like Parrots) in the Schooles, Stand pratling, these (me thought) were pretty fooles, And therefore in some hope to profit so, That I like them (at least) might make a show; I reacht my Bookes that I had cast about, To see if I could picke his meaning out: And prying on them with some diligence, At length, I felt my dull intelligence Begin to open; and perceived more In halfe an houre, than halfe a yeÃ«re before. And (which is strange) the things I had forgot, And till that very day remembred not, Since first my Tutor read them; those did then Returne into my memory agen: So, that with which I had so much to doe, A weeke made easie, yea, and pleasing too. And then not therewith thorowly content, I practic'd to maintaine an argument: And having waded thorow Sophistrie, A little lookt into Philosophie, And thinking there the Ethicks not enough, I had a further longing yet to know The cause of Snow, Haile, Thunder, Frost and Rain. The Lightnings, Meteors, and what here 'twere vain For me to speake of, sith I shall but show it, To those that better than my selfe doe know it. Then from the causes of things naturall I went to matters Metaphysicall. Of which when I a little newes could tell, I (with the rest in Schooles to wrangling fell.) And (as example taught me) to disgrace her, When I oppos'd the Truth, I could out-face her. But now ensues the worst; I getting foot, And thus digesting Learnings bitter root: Was ready to have reacht the fruit and thought I should a calling in that place have sought, I found that for other ends ordain'd, Was from that course perforce to be constrain'd. For Fortune that full many a boone hath lost me, Thus in the reaping my contentment, crost me. You sir (quoth she) that I must make my slave, For whom in store a thousand plagues I have, Come home I pray and learne to hold the plough, For you have read Philosophy enough. If wrangling in the Schooles be such a sport, Goe fee those Ploydens at the Innes of Court: For (aske your parish-neighbours who can tell) Those fellowes doe maintaine contention well. For art in numbers, you no coyle need keepe. A little skill shall serve to tell your sheepe. Seeke not the Starres thy evils should relate, Lest when thou know them thou grow desperate; And let alone Geometry ('tis vaine) I'l finde you worke enough to marre your braine: Or would you study Musick? else 'twere pitty, And yet it needs not, you shall finde I'l fit ye: I'l teach you how to frame a song, and will Provide you cares to be the subject still. This, Fortune or my Fate did seeme to tell me, And such a chance, indeed, ere long befell me. For ere my yeares would suffer me to be Admitted to require the low'st degree: By Fates appointment (that no stay can brooke) The Paradise of England I forsooke To Art and Study both, I bad farewell, With all that good my thoughts did once foretell: The sweetest of my hopes I left and went In quest of Care, Despaire, and Discontent. For seeing I was forc'd to leave those Mountaines. Fine groves, faire walks, &amp; sweet delightful Fountains And saw it might not unto me be granted To keepe those places where the Muses haunted, I home returned somewhat discontent, And to our Bentworth beechy shadowes went, Bewailing these my first endeavours lost, And so to be by angry fortune crost, Who though she daily doth much mischiefe to me, Can never whilst I live a greater doe me, Yet there, e'er she on me procur'd her will, I learn'd enough to scorne at fortune still: Yea, use had made her envy seeme so vaine, That I grew almost proud of her disdaine: And having through her first malice worne, Began to take a pleasure in her scorne. But after I returned as is said, And had a season in the Countrey stai'd, I there perceiv'd (as I had long suspected) My selfe of some unjustly ill-affected: And that e'en those whom I had truly loved, Had foes unto my good ungently proved, I found though they in shew my friends had been, (And kept their hidden malice long unseene, With such faire shewes as if they sought my good,) None my advancement with more spight withstood. For, (seeming kinde) they often did perswade My friends to learne me some Mechanick Trade, Vrging expence (perhaps) and telling how That Learning is but little made of now; When 'twas through malice, cause they fear'd that I Might come to understand my selfe thereby, Exceed their knowledge and attaine to doe My selfe more good than they would wish me to: Some such, or worse, at best a wicked end, Thus mov'd this selfe-conceited crew to bend Their spightfull heads by secret meanes to crosse My wisht desire and propagate my losse. But having noted this their hollownesse, And finding that meere Countrey businesse Was not my Calling; to avoid the spight, (Which at that season was not showne out-right) And to escape the over-dangerous smiles, Of those new-found up-landish Crocodiles; Vpon some hopes I soone forsooke againe The shady Grove and sweet delightfull plaine, To see the place of this great Iles resort, And try, if either there or at the Court. I might by good endeavour action finde, Agreeing with the nature of my minde. But there I view'd another world me thought; And little hope or none of that I sought. I saw I must (if there I ought would doe) First learne new fashions, and new language too. If I should hang'd have beene I knew not how To teach my body how to cringe or bow, Or to embrace a fellowes hinder quarters, As if I meant to steale away his garters; When any stoopt to me with conges trim, All I could doe was stand and laugh at him Blesse me tought I, what will this Coxcomb doe, When I perceiv'd one reaching at my shooe. But when I heard him speake, why, I was fully Possest, we learn'd but-barbarisme in Tully. There was nor street, nor lane, but had a Wench, That at once c?ming could have learn'd them French Grecians had little there to doe (poore soules,) Vnlesse to talke with beggermen in Pauls. All our Schoole-Latine would not serve to draw An Instrument; adjudged good in law: Nay which is more, they would have taught me faine To goe new learne my English tongue againe; As if there had beene reason to suspect Our ancient-used Hampshire Dialect. There I perceiv'd those brutish thronging swarmes, That were transformed by lew'd Cyrces charmes, There heard I wanton Syrens tune the lay, That worke th' unwary travellers decay. The cruell Lycanthropi walkt in sight, So did the beastly loose Hermaphrodite. I saw Chimera's, Furies fearefull things, And fiends whose tongues are such envenum'd stings, As plague not onely bodies that have breath, But make a wound that oft uncur'd by death; The next in bloud doth poyson and goes nigh To ruine a mans posterity. There I saw Guls that have no braine at all, And certaine Monsters which they Gallants call; New brood of Centaures that were onely proud Of having their beginning from a Cloud. These with a thousand other creatures more, Such as I never saw the like before, In stranger shaps, and more deform'd and vile, Than ever yet appear'd to Mandivile, Flockt there; that I almost to doubt began, How I might passe the straights of Magalan, Or gotten on the sudden (with such case) To see the wonders at th' Antipodes. O Lord thought I, what doe I meane to runne, Out of Gods blessing thus into the Sunne! What comfort or what goodnesse here can I Expect among these Anthropophagi, Where like the droves of Neptune in the water, The lesse are made a prey to feed the greater! Certaine it is I never shall be able, To make my humour suit to please this rabble; Better it were I liv'd at home with wants, Than here with all these strange inhabitants, Whose natures doe with me so disagree, I shall scoffe at them though they ruine me: Yet being loth to turne till I had try'd, What fate my new adventure would betide, I staid for my experience and withall Flattered my selfe, with hope there would befall, Something unto my share well worth my sute, Which honesty might serve to execute, Without respecting how to please the rude, And Apish humours of this multitude. But all in vaine I that preferment sought, Ill fortune still my hopes confusion wrought. Which though for ominous some understood, Yet I presum'd upon some future good; And (though I scarce am wish't so well of some) Beleeve there is a happy time to come: Which when I have most need of comfort, shall Send me true Ioy to make amends for all. But say it be not whilst I draw this aire, I have a heart (I hope) shall ne'er despaire; Because there is a God, with whom I trust, My soule shall triumph when my bodie's dust. Yet when I found that my endeavours still Fell out as they would have't that wisht me ill; And when I saw the world was growne so coy, To curbe me as too young then to imploy: And that her greatnesse though she did not want me, Or found no calling bad enough to grant me: (And having scap't some envies which to touch, Vnto this purpose appertaines not much) Weighing both that and therewith also this; How great a shame and what reproach it is To be still idle; and because I spy'd How glad they would be that my state envi'd, To finde me so although the world doth scorne T'allow me action, as if I were borne Before my time; yet e'en to let her see, In spight of Fortune I'd employed be; Casting preferments too much care aside, And leaving that to God that can provide; The actions of the present time I ey'd, And all her secret villanies descry'd: I stript Abuse from all her colours quite, And laid her ugly face to open sight. I labour'd to observe her waies, and then In generall the state and tricks of men. Wherein although my labour were not seene, Yet (trust me) the discovery hath beene My great content: and I haue for my paine, Although no outward yet an inward gaine. In which because I can with all my heart, Allow my Countrey-men to share my part, And cause I thinke it may doe some a pleasure, One opportunity Ile now take leasure. And summon up my Muse to make relation; I may b'imployd ere long, now's my Vacation. An Jntroduction. Come then Invention, and call Iudgement in, Knowledge and Reason fie where have you bin? Goe whistle of my Muse that wanton, With Epigrams, Love-Sonnets, Roundelayes, And such like trifling gaine: bid her come on, I have found braver prey to seize upon. Some new inspired power warmes my heart, And addes fresh courage unto every part: New bloud hath fild up all my Love-dride veines, A sacred Fury hath possest my braines: Something there is swels in my troubled brest, Till it be utter'd I expect no rest; For full with matter like a Sibyl Nun, I shall grow furious if't be long undone. Then rouse thee Muse, each little Hobby plies, At Scarabes, and painted Butterflies: Leave thou such trash, it is not now for us To flie for pleasure; wee'l in earnest trusse Leave base attempts to buzzards or the kite, And checke the bravest in their proudest flight. But thou me thinks seem'st sickly feathered, As if thy sprightly heart extinguished, Had left thee nothing of the same thou wert, Dejection hath possessed every part, And thou look'st dull unfit for lofty-things, As if thy wanton flight had tir'd thy wings. Lest therefore thou should'st faint, forsake the first, And turne thy selfe into a Satyrist; Not of the roughest; nor the mildest sort: Be most in earnest, but sometimes in sport. What e'er thou finde to speake be not affraid, But for assistance crave th' Almighties aide. And to that grace and power which he shall daigne, Adde all thy best endeavours to attaine So thriving an event that men may see, Heauen had decreed to helpe and favour thee. Looke to thy taske for know thou must unfold The strangest nature that was ever told: Lanch that foule deepe impostumated sore: Which shamelesse time hath so well skinned ore. As ripping up thereof some smart will be: Yet strike it home, and none shall hinder thee; Search if thou canst, till thou the bottome sound, Set not too farre lest thou thy selfe confound, And (by too neere inquirie) smothered lye, In the unfathom'd depths of villany; For (doe not mis-conceive what I intend) No message to th' Antipodes I send: Nor have I any meaning thou should'st goe To search th' Earths center, what lies hid below, Or undermine it for rich Minerals: Thou shalt not have to doe with Vegetals. Strange natures have both stones, trees, herbs &amp; plants Which let them seeke for that imployment wants. There is a Herbe some say whose vertue's such, It in the pasture onely with a touch Vnshooes the new-shod Steed. Within the North The Scottish Iles eal'd Orcades bring forth Trees, (or else Writers faine it) from whose seeds, A certaine kinde of water-foule proceeds. The Loadstone also drawes the steele unto it, Yet hath no ginne nor instrument to doe it: Rare powers in Nature; and yet none of these, Nor what lies hidden in the vast wilde Seas, Meane I to speake of: I no knowledge have, What monsters play with Neptunes boystrous waves: Nor quality of birds, or beasts I sound, For soone their open natures may be found: Mans wisdome may, with little inquisition Finde out the brutish creatures true condition. For by experience we for certaine know The Elephant much love to man will show. The Tygers, Wolves, and Lions, we doe finde, Are ravenous, fierce, and cruell even by kinde. We know at carryon we shall finde the Crowes, And that the Cock the time of midnight knowes: By a few daies experience we may see, Whether the Mastife curst or gentle be. And many other natures we finde out, Of which we have no cause at all to doubt: But there's another Creature called Man, Note him who will, and tell me if he can, What his condition is; observe his deeds, His speech his raiment, yea, and how he feeds, Try him a yeere, a month, an age, and when You have so try'd him; say, what is he then? Retaines he either unto PrÃ¦ster Iohn, Or else unto the whore of Babylon? If that you know not which of them to grant, Is he a Brownist, or a Protestant? If in an age you cannot finde out whether, Are you so much as sure that he is either? Is his heart proud or humble? know you where Or when he hates, or loves, or stands in feare? Or who can say (in Conscience I thinke none) That this mans words and deeds, &amp; thoughts are one Where shall you him so well resolved finde, That wants a wandring and a wavering? Nay he of whom you have most triall, when You see him dying will you trust him then? Perhaps you may yet questionlesse he leaves you A minde misdoubting still that he deceives you. And no great wonder, for he's such an elfe, That ever is uncertaine of himselfe, He is not semper idem in his will, Nor stands on this or that opinion still, But varies; he both will and will not too, Yea even the thing he thinkes and sweares to doe He many times omits and not alone Hath from anothers expectation gone, But least to any one he should prove just, Himselfe he guiles if in himselfe he trust. But this same diverse and inconstant creature, That is so contrary in his owne nature, 'Tis he that now my Muse must here devise, Whilst he is living to Anatomize; 'Tis his Abusive and ill-taught condition (Although it be beyond all definition) She must discover with the boundlesse rage, Of the unbridled humours of this age Yet 'tis a mighty taske, whose undertaking, Would make all Argus eyes, forget their waking: And I doe feare I may attempt as well, To dragge againe to light the dogge of hell. For all Alcides toiles had not beene more, Though his twice-sixe had beene twice-sixty-score. So infinite is this I must unfold; That I might write and speake till I were old, I know that I should leave unspoken then, Most of those humours I ave seene in Man; And still confesse in him that hidden be Thousands of humors more than I can see, Somewhat he hath to doe would trace him out In every action that he goes about: Or but looke after him and see the path, He trtades, what contraries it hath. To finde him by his words were to assay, To seeke a fish out by his watry way; Or chase the Swallow to her home at night, Through all the pathlesse windings in her flight, But to observe him in his thoughts were more Than all the labours mentioned before. The never ending, winding, turning way That the unbounded minde of man doth stray, So full of wonder is that admiration Hath nigh confounded my imagination With too much musing thereupon: but yet Sith either want of yeeres or want of wit, Or lacke of worke, or lacke of all, hath brought me To be more needfull than a number thought me; Sith it some time and study too hath cost me, And many an humour of mine owne hath lost me; Sith it hurts none and sith perhaps some may Be benefited by't another day: Though as I said, the taske be not alone, Too huge to be perform'd by any one, But more than all the world can well dispatch; Looke what I could by observation catch, And my weake memory well bare away, I registred against another day: Nor will I ought that I remember spare, Save things unfit and such as needlesse are; Here I will teach my rough Satyricke Rimes To be as madde and idle as the times Freely I will discover what I spy, And in despight of curiosity, Maske in a homely phrase as simply plaine, As other men are mystically vaine; I'l breake the closet of mans private sin, Search out the villanies conceal'd therein; And if their sight may not infectious be, Draw them to view in spight of secrecie; Greatnesse and Custome shall not have their will Without controule so to Authorize still, That though much be amisse, yet no man dare Seeme to take notice that offences are. Weele brand them, and so brand them all shall see, We durst not onely say such faults there be; But startle those who had securely long Slept senselesse of all shame and others wrong. None will I spare for favour or degree, My verse like death shall so impartiall be, If that my father or my brother halt, Though I spare them, I will not spare their fault: No, mine owne follies that are most belov'd, Shall not escape their censures unreprov'd, Now some will say, fit 'twere I held my tongue, For such a taske as this I am too young: I ne'er had dealings in the world with men, How can I speake of their conditions then? I cannot, they conclude: strong reason, why, Know none how market goes but such as buy? We finde that it is oft and daily seene When a deceitfull shifting knave hath beene Playing at Cards with some unskilfull gull, Whose purse is lin'd with crownes and penny-full, He by some nimble passage may deceive, Which though the simple Gamester nere perceive Another may the Cheaters craft espie That is no Player, but a stander by. So I aloofe may view without suspition, Mens idle humors and their weake condition, Plainer perhaps than many that have seene More daies and on Earth stage have actors beene. And tis no marvell: for imployments takes them Quite from themselves, &amp; so dim-sighted make them They cannot see the fooleries they doe, Nor what ill Passions they are subject to: Then who e'er carpe, the course I have begun, If God assist me spight of them I'l runne: And lest the Exordium hath too tedious bin, What I intended loe I now begin. Of Man. Mounted aloft on Contemplations wings, And noting with my selfe the state of things I plainly did perceive as on a Stage, The confus'd actions of this present age; I view'd the World, and viewing saw my fill, Because that all I saw therein was ill. I weigh'd it well, and found it was the Scene Of Villanie, of Lust, and all uncleane And loath'd Corruption. Seeing which, my minde, (That by some inspiration gan to finde The place was not in fault for this) search't on To finde the cause of this Confusion. And noting every creature there, I found That onely man was the chiefe spring and ground Of all this uprore: Yea, I soone did see, Hee there was all in all, and none but Hee. Then having also a desire to know Mans true condition; I began to grow Yet more inquisitive. An old Record At last I hapt upon, which did afford Much sacred light. It shew'd, He was a Creature, First made by God, just and upright by nature. That in his likenesse fram'd he was compounded Of Soule and Body: That, this last was founded Of earth: The first, infus'd by inspiration. And that, the finall cause of his creation Was to set forth the glory of his Maker; And with him to be made a joynt-partaker Of endlesse happinesse. Growne much amaz'd To read this of him, for a time I paus'd. And finding now in Man no mark or signe That ere he was a Creature so divine; I knew not what to thinke unlesse the same Should meane some other creature of that name: But prying further on, I there found out The resolution of my present doubt: I saw the cause of's fall; How with Free-will, He fell from his first goodnesse unto ill: I saw how he from happinesse did slide, Through disobedience and unthankfull pride: Yea, and I found, how by that cursed Fall He was bereaved and quite stript of all That so adorn'd him. His first holinesse Was chang'd to a corrupted filthinesse; Then he began to draw a painfull breath, And was a slave, made captive unto Death: His body was expos'd to labour, sweat, And much disquieting. He got his meat With sorrow, care, and many perturbations, And then his soule grew subject unto Passions And strange distempratures. Moreover, he So perfect miserable grew to be, That if he had not a Re-generation, Nothing was left him but meere desperation. This, having seen, I made no question than, But it was spoken of that Creature Man, Which I sought after. Searching further yet, On some Apocryphall Records I hit. The works of wise Philosophers; from whence I yet received more intelligence Concerning him: for there they do unfold Each part about his body, and have told Secrets of nature very rare to finde. They have considered also of the Mind The Vnderstanding part: and do relate The nature of his Soule, and her estate. Deep Mysteries they be: but seeing, I Have never searched that Philosophie, So far as those: And sith, I shall but tell Such things, as no man can explain so well As they themselves: I leave you to their books. In which, who ere with good advisement lookt, Shall finde it largely handled. As for me, I mean to speak but what I know, and see By tri'd experience; which perhaps may give (Although I have but now begun to live) Some profitable notes. First, I avow What-ever Man hath been; that, he is now A reasonable living Creature; who Consisteth of a Soul and Body too. His Body flesh and bloud, to sinne subjected, And from his very birth therewith infected, Grows riper in uncleannesse. Then his Soule, A pure and lasting substance, is made foule Through th' others filthinesse, and much supprest By divers hurtfull passions, which molest And hinder her proceedings: yea, hee's this, A Creature that exceeding wretched is: And that he may be sure no fault to want, Vain, Fickle, Weak, and wondrous Arrogant And though his nature heretofore were pure, Now nothing is more fading or unsure. But Ile omit at this time to relate The courses I've observ'd in's outward state: For though the Body that before the Fall Sustain'd no sorrow, were it ne're so small, Doth now feel hunger, with heat, thirst, and cold, A feeble birth, defects in being old, With thousands more; &amp; though each gasp of breath In misery he draw untill his death: Yet all this outward change which I do finde, Is nothing when I do behold the minde. For, there inordinate and brutish Passion Keeps umpire; and hath got predomination. Full many a pensive thought doth now molest His troubled minde, whose conscience slept in rest. His best contents but discontentments are: His chiefe of pleasures are so mixt with care, And with so little comfort he obtains them; Or with such smart, and danger, he retains them; Or with such feare of losing them, enjoyes them; That those distastings, in the taste, destroyes them. Amongst his own desires do hourely rise So many wondrous Contrarieties, And vain repentings of what's done before; As all his good, makes but his ill the more. This day hee's cheerefull, and to morrow sad, E'ne from the same occasion made him glad. The Minde, which sometime harbor'd so much good, That evill but in name, was understood; Knows ill so well, as of that good bereft, The name of goodnesse now is scarcely left. And unto me a wonder 'tis become To see, what glories man is fallen from. The best are bad, yet I observed still, There are degrees amongst men in their ill. The basest creatures that here breathe on earth, (Inheriting corruption by their birth,) In the condition of their life, are farre Lesse different from what the worst men are, Than they are from the best. Perhaps the shapes (Vnlesse it be some strange disguised Apes) Remain alike: but their poore soules are quite Exchang'd to that which we call Appetite. For, who can name of reasonable give, To what is made but meerely sensitive? It was a throne where Vertue ruling sate, Ioyntly with Reason, her beloved mate: And they two under sweet obedience, then, Kept that fair place, th' unblemish't Ile of Man: But sith with Good vie learn'd to know the Ill, In stead of Reason, wee have set up Will. The minde is nothing but a mint of jarres, Or Little-world of mad domestique warres: Vertue's depos'd thence, and Vice rule obtaines; Yea, Vice from Vice there by succession reignes: Expelling those whom Vertues presence graceth, And in their steads these hurtfull Monsters placeth; Fond Love, and Lust, Ambition, Enmitie, Foolish Compassion, Ioy and Iealousie, Feare, Hope, Despaire and Sadnesse, with the Vice Call'd Hate, Revenge, and greedy Avarice, Choler and Cruelty: which I perceiv'd To be the onely causes Man's bereav'd Of quietnesse and rest. Yea, these I found To be the principall and onely ground Of all pernicious mischiefs that now rage, Or have disturbed him in any age. These losing Reason, their true Prince, began To breed disturbance in the heart of Man. Each laid a severall claim (forsooth) and hee Would be the Monarch in this Emperie Ruine had got the upper hand, and they Would be Commanders, that were made t'obey. Love, (wh? as Reason rul'd) you would have thought Would never have been forc't or drawn to naught. When God, the Chaos did divide; then he Set it to look things should not disagree; And taught it sweetly how to move the minde, Both for increasing and preserving kinde. But now, the bound it had, contenteth not; A vein of domineering it hath got. And the whole Man is held in slavery, Within the compasse of that Tyranny. Such apishnesse it now hath entertain'd, That all the credit which it had is stain'd. Yea, 'tis as far from what it was, as we From our more honour'd ancient English be, And so unlike unto it selfe doth prove, We fearce dare give it now the name of Love. Ambition, that erst gently mov'd Desire To nought else but to good things to aspire; Now must be Lord of Mis-rule, and will force The Minde beyond her bound, from bad to worse, Revenge doth claim a Princedome, and will be The sole Commander in this Seignorie. That cruell Ruffian, that in vain doth strive, His Of-spring from true Valour to derive. Despaire and Feare (two Rake-hels more) that Man Had never knowledge of, till Sinne began; With mighty troops of terrours, play their part, To overthrow th' weak fortresse of the heart. Yea, every Passion strives that onely he Might Ruler in that Microcosmos be. Ev'n Hope, (that when this discord first fell out, Was sent to keep Despaires rude forces out, And be a comfort to this troubled state,) Becomes an Actor in this foule debate. And when she had got footing in his brest, Vnder the colour of procuring rest, Built Castles in the ayre; from whence did grow; Another meanes of Reasons overthrow: Yea, Choler, jealousie, black Envy, Hate, And bloudy Cruelty aim'd at this state. Ioy, (though fare shew it made of discontent,) And kinde Compassion (though she weeping went,) Made private means to sway all to their wils, Without the least care of ensuing ills. That by their discord (I perceive) began All whatsoever is amisse in Man. And therefore I do here intend to show, Ere I go farther, what ill humours flow From these fore-named: and I will declare, To what Abuses most men subject are, Through every of them: for, when I took view, Although I saw not all, I found a few. And here because I will not order break, I will asunder of each Passion speak. Of the Passion of Love. Satyre 1. First Love, the same I here the first do call, Because that Passion is most naturall; And of it selfe could not be discommended, Wert not with many a foule Abuse attended. Or so much out of measure, as we see By those in whom it reignes it oft will be. For, look where't grows into extremity, It soon becometh Vertues Lethargie; Makes them set light by Reasons sound direction, And beares them headlong by untam'd affection. Counsel's in vain; cause when this fit doth take them, Reason and Vnderstanding both forsake them, It makes them sometimes merry, sometimes sad; Vntam'd men milde, and many a milde man mad. To fools it wisedome gives, and makes the witty To shew th?selves most fools (the more's the pitty.) Some it makes purblinde, that they do not know The snow-white Cygnet from the cole-black Crow. And one to gold compares his Mistris haire, When 'tis like Fox-fur; and doth think shee's faire, Though she in beauty be not far before The swart West-Indian or the tawny Moore. Oh, those faire star-like eyes of thine! one saies, When to my thinking, she hath look't nine waies; And that sweet breath; when I think (out upon't) Twould blast a flower if she breathed on't. Another having got a dainty peece, (Prouder than Iason with his golden Fleece) Comm?ds her vertues (which must needs have many Because she never maketh use of any;) Yea, swears shee's chast, and takes her for no lesse, When all that know her, know her ficklenesse. Another groweth carelesse of his health, Neglects his credite, and consumes his wealth; Hath found a pretty Peat, procur'd her favour, And sweares that he, in spight of all, will have her; Well, let him take her, sith they are contented, But such rash matches are the soon'st repented. Then there is one who having found a peere In all things worthy to be counted deere, Wanting both art and heart his minde to break, Sits sighing (Woe is me) and will not speak. All company he hates, is oft alone, Growes melancholy, weeps, respecteth none, And in despaire, seeks out a way to dye, When he might live and finde a remedy. But how now; Wast not you (sayes one) that late So humbly begg'd a Boon at Beauties gate? Was it not you that to a female Saint Indited your Philaretes complaint, With many dolefull Sonnets? was't not you? Sure twas, saies he: but then how comes it now You carp at Love thus in a Satyr's vain? Take heed you fall not in t'her hands again: Sure if you do, you shall in open Court, Be forc't to sing a Palinodia for't. What? are your brains drie, or your bloud grown cold? Or are you on a sudden waxen old, To flout at Love, which men of greatest wit Allow in youth as naturall and fit? What reason have you for't else? what pretence Have you to make excuse for this offence? To him I answer, That indeed, even I Was lately subject to this maladie: Lik't what I now dislike; imploy'd good times In the composing of such idle Rimes As are objected: From my heart I sent Full many a heavy sigh, and sometimes spent Vnmanly teares. I thought, I must confesse, If she I lov'd had smil'd, no happinesse Might equalize it, and her frown much worse (O God forgive me!) than the Churches curse. I did (as some do) not much matter make, To hazard soule and body for her sake. Having no hope, sometime I did despaire, Sometime (too much) built Castles in the aire. In many a foolish humour I have been As well as others. Look where I have seen Her (whom I lov'd) to walk when she was gone, Thither I often have repair'd alone; As if I thought the places did contain Some poore contentment, (Oh exceeding vain!) Yet, what if I have been thus idly bent, Shall I be now ashamed to repent? Moreover I was in my Childehood then, And am scarce yet reputed for a man. And therefore neither cold, nor old, nor dry, Nor cloy'd with any foule disease am I, Whereby the strength of nature is declin'd, 'Tis no such cause that made me change my minde: But my affection, that before was blinde, Rash, and unruly, now begins to finde That it had run a large and fruitlesse race, And thereupon hath given Reason place. So that by Reason, what no Reason might Perswade me from before, I have out-right Iustly forsaken; for because I see 'Twas vain, absurd, and nought but fooler Yet for all this, look where I lov'd of late, I have not turn'd it in a spleen to hate; No; for 'twas first her vertue and her wit, Taught me to see how much I wanted it. Then as for Love, I do allow it still, I never did dislik't, nor never will; So it be vertuous, and contain'd within The bounds of reason: but when 'twill begin To run at randome, and her limits break, I must, because I cannot chuse but speak. But I forget my selfe: Wherefore am I So tedious in my own Apologie? It needed not at all; I'le on again, And shew what kinde of Lovers yet remain. One sort I finde yet of this loving crew, Whose quality I think, is known to few; These seek by all the means they can to gain Each Virgins liking: Sometime not in vain. The thing they would, they have, but when 'tis got. Sorry they are, and wish they had it not: For peradventure they have plac't their love, So as it cannot, or it must not move. And yet if they should faile but to procure it, 'Twould grieve them so they hardly would endure it. Yea, though in shew (at least) they have said nay, Their loves with like affection to repay, If they perceiv't abate, as it will doe, Both this and that will make them sorry too. But such as do into that weaknesse fall, Vnsteady and unconstant I may call. Moreover, some such humours do infect, That the same man doth diversly affect: Now he the Faire approves, anon the grace Appeares not in the colour of a face. He spies the Brown, and then that most esteems, Cause the proportion much more pleasant seems. Then, he the Wanton likes; then modest Eyes; Then loves the simple Lasse; and then the Wise: One for her pase; and for her gesture one Must be the Mistresse he adores alone; Yet peradventure ere a little while, Another wins her from him with a smile. This, with a look nigh languishing, moves pitty: That, he commends because shee's bold and witty. And longs for what anon again he loaths. Because she seem'd faire in her gaudy clothes. True worth moves few: but sure I am, not many Have for bare Vertues sake affected any. Wealth wins the most, yet they by triall prove, Though it breeds liking, yet it gains not love. Then to obtain his Mistresse one man tries How he can strain his wits to Poetize: His Passion to relate, his skill he proves? But in this blockish age it little moves: Nor do I wonder much true meaning fails, And wit so little in this case avails, Sith Dunces can have Sonnets fram'd, and send them As their inventions, when some others pen'd them. Another seeks by valour to obtain His wished prize; but now that triall's vain. The third brings wealth, and if he do not speed, The Woman's worth the suing for indeed. Then he that's neither valorous nor wise, Comes ruffling in with shamelesse brags and lies, Making a stately, proud, vain-glorious show Of much good matter, when tis nothing so. In stead of lands, to which he neere was heire, He tells her tales of Castles in the ayre: For martiall matters, he relates of fraies, Where many drew their swords, and ran their waies: His Poetry is such as he can cull From Plaies he heard at Curtain, or at Bull; And yet his fine coy Mistresse, Mary-Muffe, The soonest taken with such broken stuffe. Another shallow brain hath no device, But prates of some strange casts he had at Dice; Brags of his play; yea, sure it doth befall, He vaunts oft times of that which marreth all. But some I note (now fie on such a man) That make themselves as like them as they can, Thereby to win their loves: they fain their pase, Order their looks, and strive to set their face To be demure. Some woe by nods and looks; Some by their sighs, and others by their books. Some have a nature must not be denaid, And will grow furious if they be delaid. Other again have such a fancy got, If they soon speed, then they esteem them not. When women woo some men do most affect them, And some again for wantons do suspect them: Besides, we see that fools themselves they make, What toyes they count of for their Wenches sake. One, for some certain months, or weeks, or daies, Weares in his hat a branch of wither'd Bayes; Or sweareth to imploy his utmost power, But to preserve some stale neglected flower. He weares such colours as for Lovers be, Drinks vowed healths upon his bared knee: Sues mainly for a shoo-string, and doth crave her To grant him but a busk-point for a favour. And then to note (as I have seen) an Asse That by her window whom he loves must passe, With what a fained pase the Woodcock stalks; How scurvily he fleareth as he walks: And if he ride, how he rebounds and trots, As if his horse were troubled with the bots: 'Twould make one swell with laughing. In a day He makes more errands than he needs that way, Bearing himselfe as if she still espide him; When as perhaps she flouts, or looks beside him. Nay, should I tell you all the Vanitie I have observed in this maladie, I should shame Lovers: bus Ile now be husht, For had I said more, I my selfe had blusht. Yet know; although this passion I have tide To love of Women, it concludes beside All whatsoever kinde of loves there be, Vnlesse they keep the minde from troubles free; And yeeld to Reason: but of such-like Lovers, My Muse hereafter other feats discovers. Of Desire, or Lust. Satyre 2. Lvstfull Desire (although twere rather fit To some bruit Creature to attribute it) Shall be presented in the second place; Because it shrowds a vile deformed face Beneath Loves Vizard, and assumes that name, Hiding it own fault with the others blame. 'Tis a base Passion, from whose sink doth flow Many base humours. 'Tis the overthrow Of all in whom it enters. 'Tis an evill Worse than to be possessed with a Devill. This, this is that which oft caus'd publike strife, And private discord. This makes man and wife Grow each to other cold in their affection, And to the very marrow sends infection. This spoiles the body; this doth make the face Look wan, pale, yellow, and doth much disgrace The beauty of it. This bereaveth quite, The bones of marrow, and the eyes of sight. It shrinks the sinews; and from thence doth sprout Griefes of the stomake, Leprosie and Gout, With other such: beside, it doth decay Not life alone; but also takes away Both memory and understanding too; And many other mischiefes else will doe. And which way comes that foule disease to us We call the French, so vile and odious? I'st not by Lust? Breed not such-like desires Children begotten by unlawfull Sires? Strange generations; beds so oft defilde, That many a Father scarcely knowes his childe? Or, is't not hence this common Proverbe growes, 'Tis a wise childe that his own Father knowes? Doth it not others reputation foyle? And them e'ne of their dearest jewells spoile? Yes, and from hence a thousand other crimes Do daily spring: and yet in these our times 'Tis highly made of. Yea, 'tis Lust doth weare The richest garments, and hath curious'st fare: The softest beds it hath to take repose With sweet perfumes; but sure ther's need of those. Drawn in a Coach it visits, now and then, Some neare acquaintance 'mongst the Noblemen. And yet the Court alone frequents it not, But in the City residence hath got, Where, in a daily service it imployes, Young Cocknies, Burgomasters, Roaring-Boyes, Yea, Porters, Prentises, and all that may Be service able to it any way. 'Twere much to note the pain that some endure, And at how high a rate they do procure Their beastly wills. Ther's many spend their stocks In Ruffes, Gowns, Kirtles, Petty-coats, and Smocks. For which, on's paid with that shall make him craul (If he be friended to some Hospitall. Another quitted for his well-spent stuffe, By some grim Serjeant with a Counter-buffe: A third it brings (if long that course he follows) First to the Gaole, and so-forth to the Gallowes. And what have you observed to have bin The usuall associates of this sin? But filthy speeches, bold fac't impudence, Vnseemly actions, riot, negligence; Or such as these. Yea, to procure their lust It makes them into any mischiefs thrust, (How hatefull or apparant ere they be) Or put in practise any villanie. Moreover, where it enters once, the minde Can no true rest, nor any quiet finde. We see it also maketh them to crave, Not what is best, but what they long to have. Yea, Lust hath many mischiefs that ensue it, Which most men see, but few the lesse eschew it. Men rather now, as if 'twere no offence, Are grown to such a shamelesse impudence, They vaunt and brag of their lascivious facts, No lesse than some of brave heroick acts. And, not a few of this same humour be, That would be thought the foes of Chastitie. By whom, if I see ill, Ile sure conceale it; For they themselves will, to their shames, reveale it. Ther's others, who disliking so to vaunt, Will, Si non castÃ¨, tamen cautÃ¨, grant, (For that's their Motto) they make modest showes, But what they do in secret, man nere knows. Some makes a Baud of the divine profession, (Like Shavelings in Auricular Confession.) Th' other are bad, and sure of God accurst: But, of all others, these I deem the worst. Ther's other Gallants would desire but this, Without suspition to confer and kisse: For other pleasures they would never crave them, Nay, if they might, they sweare they wil not have th?. So mean perhaps, but time brings alteration; And a faire woman is a shrewd temptation. Then many make their feigned love to be A cloak to cover their immodestie: These will protest, and vow, and sweare their life Consists in having whom they woo to wife. Yet, if the villains can their lust fulfill, They will forswear them, and be living still. Some do court all (and not alone to prove; But for because with all they are in love.) With such deep Passion, that they cannot smother Their hot affection till they meet another. But why will Man against himselfe and Reason Consent to such a Tyrant in his Treason? Why will he so his liberty forgoe, To be a slave to such a monstrous foe? For what is this same Passion we call Lust? Is't not a Brutish longing? an unjust And foule desire, unlawfully to gain Some evill pleasure? Or, to speak more plain; A furious burning passion, whose hot fumes Corrupt the understanding, and consumes The very flesh of man? Then what's the fact? What may I terme that vile and shamefull act, But this; The execution of an ill, Out of set purpose, and with a good will, In spight of Reason? Tell me, is't not base? When men shall so their worthy sex disgrace, To give their bodies in a deed unclean, With a foule nastie prostituted quean? Or, in their understanding be so dull, As to observe an idle short-heel'd Trull? A puling female Devil, that hath smiles Like Syrens Songs, and teares like Crocodyles. Yet there be some (I will not name them now) Whom I have seen unto such puppets bow, And be as serviceable as a Groome That fears another man will beg his roome. They have been glad full oft to please their pride With costly gifts, and forced to abide Imperious scoffes, with many scornfull words, Such as the humour they are in affords. And yet for these they'l venture honours, lives, If they command it: when on their poore Wives (Though they in beauty love, and true delight, Exceed them more than day-time doth the night) Those common Courtesies they'l scarce bestow Which they to ev'ry stranger use to show: Yea, &amp; their Lust doth wrap them in such blindnesse, They cannot give them one poore look in kindnesse. Moreover, for their lusts they have not laid Base plots alone, like him that was convey'd In a close trunk, because in secresie He would (unseen) enjoy his venery. I say not onely therein have they reacht Their damn'd inventions: it hath also stretcht Vnto strange Lusts, of which I will not speak, Because I may offend the minde that's weak: Or, least I to some simple one should show Those sinnes by naming he did never know. Then here Ile leave: there's lurking holes such store, This stinking Vermine I will hunt no more. Of Hate. Satyre 3. Bvt I have rouz'd another here as bad, They call it Hate; a worse I never had Before in chase: I scarce can keep (in sooth) My selfe from danger of his venom'd tooth. This is the Passion that doth use to move The minde a clean contrarie way to Love. It is an inspiration of the Devill, That makes men long for one anothers evill. It cankers in the heart, and plagueth most, Not him that's hated, but the hatefull host. And yet there's too too many I do know, Whose hearts with this foule poyson over-flow: Of which I have a true intelligence, By the sharp scoffes and slanders springing thence: But, where it rules, they cannot well conceale it, But either words, or deeds, or both reveale it. Were it just causes that did still ingender. This passion in them; or if they could render A reason for't, 'twere somewhat. But their will Carries them on in spight of reason still. These are their humours. For a slight offence They'l hate th' offender for a recompence. Some malice all that any way excell, Although they know it farre from doing well. And many have abhorred (God amend them) The Stranger that did never yet offend them: Which they are not ashamed to confesse, Yet in their hate continue neere the lesse. But though that they can yeeld no reason why They beare them causelesse malice, yet can I. Their hearts are ill, and it is seldome known, That a sweet brook from bitter springs hath flown. Ther's some too, when they see a man respected, Though they are nothing by that means neglected, They inly grudge, and outwardly disdain, Being alike condition'd as was Cain. Some hate their friends that love and count them dear, As by the sequell plainly shall appeare; One that a seeming friendship had profest me, Vpon a time did earnestly request me, That I would plainly my opinion shew, What I of his conditions thought or knew: And that I would without exceptions tell What things in him did not become him well. I scorning flattery, with a single heart, 'Twixt him and me my minde did soon impart; And as a friend that is unfeigned, ought, Left nothing unreveal'd of that I thought: Yea, without soothing, him I reprehended, If I perceiv'd hee any way offended; Provided alwaies that I did not swerve From a decorum fitting to observe. But mark Mans nature: he perceiving I Had taken note of some infirmity He would not have unript; And seeing I Saw more than he wisht any man should spie Of his ill humours; (though I must confesse Being my friend, I lov'd him nothing lesse:) In stead of thanks and liking for my pains, My company and sight he now refrains; And for my kindnesse, like a thanklesse mate, Doth ill repay me with a loathing hate. This one I know, and by that one I finde, That there be many beare as bad a minde. But let us for their true conversion pray; For never Age could this more justly say, Truth hatred gets (she of such gain is sped) While Love and Charity to heaven are fled. Againe, the wicked hate beyond all measure The righteous man that contradicts their pleasure; And that's the fundamentall cause I know, That many men doe hate their teachers so. These common humours are observ'd of few, Yet may a young experience finde them true; And boldly say, that all in whom th' are found Have poysoned hearts, polluted and unsound. Yet they are more corrupt than all the rest, Who hate their friends they should account of best. But, let Men strive and study to remove This Passion from their hearts, and graft on Love. Let them not harbour such a hellish sinne; Which being entred marreth all within. Nor let them think my counsell merits laughter, Sith Scripture saies, To hate our brother's slaughter. Of Envie. Satyre 4. Then some envenom'd with an envious touch, Think ev'ry thing their neighbour hath too much, O Lord say they (if in the field they be) What goodly Corn and well-fed beasts hath he? (If in the house) they never in their lives Saw fairer women than their neighbours wives: Tis pitty she (a Lasse of such renown) Should be embraced by so rude a Clown. That house is too well furnisht, or doth stand Better than his: or it hath finer land. This Farme he thinketh more commodious much, For wood and water he had never such. Yea, so he grudges inwardly and frets At every good thing that his neighbour gets Of these besides there are, that when they see Any beloved, or in favour be, Especially in Courts and Great mens houses, Then the heart swelleth, and the envious rouses; Ne're resting till that like a spightfull Elfe, He do displace them, or disgrace himselfe. Now some are in the minde that Hate and this Still go together and one Passion is. Indeed, they foul injurious humors be, So like, they seem to have affinitie. And yet they differ (as oft kindred do) Enough at least I'me sure to make them two. Hate many times from wrongs receiv'd hath grown; Envy is seen where injuries are none. Her malice also is more generall; For Hate to some extends, and she to all. Yet envious men do least spight such as be Of ill report, or of a low degree: But rather they do take their aime at such, Who either well-beloved are, or rich. And therefore some do fitly liken these Vnto those flies we call Cantharides: Sith for the most part they alight on none But on the flowe as that are fairest blowne. Or to the boistrous winde, which sooner grubs The stately Cedar than the humble shrubs. Yet I have known it shake the bush below, And move the leafe that's wither'd long ago; As if it had not shown sufficient spight, Vnlesse it also could o'erwhelm it quite, Or bury it in earth. Yea, I have found The blast of Envy flies as low's the ground. And when it hath already brought a man Even to the very meanest state it can, Yet 'tis not satisfi'd, but still devising Which way it also may disturbe his rising. This is most true, or else it could not be That any man should hate or envy me, Being a creature (ore would think) that's plac't Too far below the touch of Envies blast. And yet they do; I see men have espi'd Something in me too that may be envi'd. But I have found it now and know the matter, The reason's, They are great, and Ile not flatter. Or else because they see that I do scorn To be their slave whose equall I am born. I heard (although twere spoken in a cloud) They censure, that my knowledge makes me proud: And that I teach so farre beyond my calling, They every houre do expect my falling; With many a prayer and prognostication, To shew their love not worthy revelation. But what care I? to quit their good surmising, I do desire fall may be their rising. Which say should once be, as I hope twill never, My hope is sure it shall not be for ever; Or else, because I know it cannot be Much lower than it is, it grieves not me. And where they say, my wit augments my pride; My conscience tells me that I am belide. For, that poore dram which heaven on me bestowes, Such lack (of what is yet more needfull) showes That I am sad to think how much I come Short of those gifts which are bestow'd on some: And knowledge of that want doth grieve me so, I have no joy to boast of that I know. But let them scandall as I heare they do, And see whose lot the shame will fall unto. The shafts are aim'd at me, but I reject them, And on the shooters may perhaps reflect them, I care not for their envy, sith they show it; Nor do I feare their malice now I know it. For to prevent the venome of their throat, I'le of their poyson make an Antidote: And their presaging (though it be abuse) I hope will serve me to an excellent use: For, where before I should have took no heed, Their words shall make mee circumspect indeed. Yea, I will be more carefull to do well, Which were a plague for them as bad as hell. Some I do know, yea, too too well I know them, And in this place do a remembrance owe them: These men when through their envy they intend To bring one out of favour with his friend, Will make as though they some great vices knew That he is guilty of, (and not a few) They'l shake their heads as if they did detest The course he follows; and that not in jest. If to the Father they dispraise the Sonne, It shall be slily indirectly done: As thus; (I hope there's some will understand) He lives, I tell you at a second hand. Should I say all I know 'twould much offend you, But more such children I pray God ne're send you. With other words of doubt to breed suspition, But dare not (being of a base condition) To name them any fault: And good cause why, It should be prov'd unto their shames a lie. Now 'tis a quality I do despise, As such an one doth him whom he envies; If any therefore do that love professe me, Lord, from their friendship I beseech thee blesse me. Some crafty ones will honour to their face Those whom they dare not openly disgrace; Yet underhand their fames they'l undermine, As lately did a seeming friend of mine. They'l sow their slander as if they with griefe Were forc'd to speak it: or that their beleefe Were loth to credit it, when 'tis well known That damn'd invention was at first their own. Some do not care how grossely they dispraise, Or how unlikely a report they raise; Because they know if't be so false and ill That one beleeves it not another will: And so their envy very seldome failes, But one way or another still prevailes. Oh vilanous conceit! an engine bent To overthrow the truest innocent: For well they know when once a slander's sown, And that a false report abroad is blown, Though they would wipe it out yet they can never: Because some scarre will stick behinde for ever. But what is this that men are so inclinde And subject to it? How may't be definde? Sure if the same be rightly understood, 'Tis but a griefe that springs from others good. Tormenting them when ever they heare tell That other mens endevours prosper well; It makes them grieve if any man be friended, Or in their hearing praised or commended. Contrariwise again, such is their spight, In other mens misfortunes they delight; Yea, notwithstanding it be not a whit Vnto their profits or their benefit. Others prosperity doth make them lean: It nigh devoureth or consumes them clean: But if they see them in much griefe, why that Doth onely make them jocund, full, and fat. Of kingdomes ruines they best love to heare, And tragicall reports do onely cheere Their hellish thoughts: and then their bleared eies Can look on nothing but black infamies. Reproachfull actions, and the foulest deeds Of shame that mans corrupted nature breeds: But they must wink when Vertue shineth bright, For feare her lustre marre their weakened sight. They do not love Encomiastick stories, Nor books that shew their predecessors glories; For good report to all men they denie, And both the living and the dead envy: Yea, many of them I do think had rather Lose all good fame, than share it with their father. The byting Satyre they do onely like, And that at some particulars must strike, Or all's worth nothing. If they can apply Some part of this to him they do envy, (As well perhaps they may) then they'l commend it: And (spight of their ill natures) I that pend it Shall have some thank. But why? not cause they deem Me or my writing either worth esteem. No, her's the reason they my labour like, They think I mean him they suppose to strike. So shall my well-meant lines become to be A wrong to others, and a snare to me. Heaven shield me fr? such monsters; for their breath Is worse than blasting, and their praise is death. And let them finde no matter here, but what May tend unto their glories whom they hate; To make them either this ill Passion flie, Or swoln with their own venome burst and die: Foule Hag of Envy, let thy snakie Elves Keep Hell with thee, and there torment themselves Your poysond conversation fitteth men For no society, but some grim den Where nothing can be heard nor seen appeare, But grones and sighes of misery and feare. Who have you yet possest that pleased stood With any private, or with publike good? VVhat mans endeavours think you prosper should If the event of things were as these would? (None can resolve me that, for it's unknown) Nor parents, no nor children, scarce their own: (I say) their own hand-works are seldome free; But subject to their proper envies be. Witnesse a certain Rich-man who of late Much pitying a neighbours wofull state, Put to his helping hand and set him cleare From all his former misery and feare. But when he saw that through his thrift and heed, He had well cur'd again his former need, And grew to pretty means, though he no whit Vnthankfull was for that his benefit: Yet being of a nature that did long, And joy to see anothers case go wrong, Having no cause, but a repining now That he once helpt him; all his studie's how To ruinate the poore mans case again, And make (through Envy) his own labour vain. Oh, that a man should so from reason range, Or entertain an humour that's so strange And so unprofitable! Tell me, Why Should we the honours or the wealth envy Of other men? If we delight to see Our brethren when in evill case they be, Lets wish them riches, titles, and promotion, 'Twill make them greedy, proud, &amp; choke devotion: 'Twill plunge them in a floud of misery, In the respect of which, the beggery We think so vile is heaven. Yea, I know It is a thousand more mens overthrow Than poverty can be. That if we hate, Or would envy who are in happy state, In my opinion they must not be such That titles have attain'd, or to be rich: But poore men rather, who are combred lesse, And have indeed the truest happinesse. But be they rich or poore I passe not whether, For my part I am sure I envy neither. So I but reach the glory I desire, I do not care how many mount up higher: And if I want not, what hurt is't to me If I the poorest in the Kingdome be. Yet from this Passion I beleeve not many Can be exempted (if there may be any) But sure more mischiefe alway doth betide To th' envious, than to him that is envide; And they have often (who would them bemoan?) Lost both their eyes to lose their neighbour one. Yea, there is many a perjur'd envious Noddy Damnes his own soule to hurt his neighbours body, But now such men may best by this be known, They'l speak to no mans honour but their own. And in their presence if you praise a man, They'l from his worth detract ev'n all they can. Such dogs as these are the detracting Momes, And he whose eyes on each new Treatise romes, To feed his humour by disgracing it, More than for his delight or benefit. But these most commonly do disalow What they would mend th?selves if they knew how. But what are they that keep the Criticks Court? Not any doubtlesse of the wiser fort, But such poore Pedants as would fain appeare A great deal abler than indeed they are. Yea, such as (when among the learn'd they chance) Are often set by for their ignorance. For, howsoever their insinuation Hath gain'd a little vulgar reputation, They are but Glow-worms that are brisk by night; And never can be seen when Sun gives light. Ill-tongu'd and envious, ignorant of shame; And vile detractors of anothers fame: But let them carp on what need any care, Sith they are known for fools without compare? But think, oh think to know and shun this evil, This matchlesse inspiration of the Devill. Remember 'tis a known apparant foe To Charitie, and friendships overthrow: A vicious humour that with hell acquaints, And hinders the Communion of Saints. Consider that, and how it makes unable To be partaker of the holy Table. Do so; survey your selves: and if you finde Such guests within you, root them from your minde: Banish that gnawing fury from your heart: And as one wisely counsells, lay apart Dissembling, Envy, Slander, Malice, Guile, With evill-speaking, as most bad and vile; In those men chiefly, whose Religion saith, Her mainest Pillar is True-Love; next Faith. Of Revenge. Satyre 5. Rome for Revenge; hee's no Comedian That acts for pleasure, but a grim Tragedian? A foul stern Monster, which if we displease him Death, wounds, and bloud, or nothing can appease him. This most inhumane Passion now and than With violence and fury hurries Man So far from that sweet mildnesse wherewith he, Being himselfe, should ever temper'd be. That Man nor Devill can we terme him well, For part he hath of earth, and part of hell. Yet this (so much of all good men disdain'd) Many there are have rashly entertain'd And hugged as a sweet contenting Passion, Though in a various and unlikely fashion. Some are so staid they can their purpose keep Long time conceal'd, to make the wound more deep; And these it is not heat of bloud that blinde, But rather the fell canker of the minde. Some by respect to time and place are staid, And some again by nothing are alaid; But them mad rage oft furiously will carry, Without respect of Friends or Sanctuary. Then some of them are fearfull, some are bolder: Some are too hot, and some again are colder. Oh, I have seen, and laught at heart to see't, Some of our hot-spurs drawing in the street, As though they could not Passions rage withstand, But must betake them to it out of hand. But why i'th street? Oh, company doth heart them, And men may see their valourous acts and part them. And yet that humour rather I commend, Than theirs whose fury hath no stay nor end, Till of their lives they have bereft their foes; The onely way to both their overthrows. Oh, poore revenge! behold, he thou hast slain, Sleeping in rest, lies free from care and pain. Death is the good mans refuge, which his God Ordain'd to be his sorrows period. And he, perhaps, thou in revenge didst slay, Enjoyes more blisse than thou canst take away; Whilst thou surviving feel'st the horrid smart Of many thousand tortures in thy heart. For say thou scape the rigor of the law, Thy wounded conscience will have many a flaw; Feares thou shalt passe by day, and then at night Dreams all of terrour thy scar'd soule affright. Orphanes and widowes curses thou shalt have To bring thee with confusion to thy grave. Which if in mercy God do shield thee from, Iustice hath set this unavoided doom, The plague of bloudshed on thy stock shall lie, Till she be quit in thy posterity. Poore world, if these thy best contentments be, Seek bloud and vengeance you that list for me. If this be sweet, heaven grant I may forgive, And never seek for vengeance whil'st I live. But now (me thinks) I heare our Hacsters tell me, With thundring words as if their breath wold fell me, I am a Coward if I will not fight. True, Cavalieros, you have spoken right: And if upon good termes you urge me to it, I have both strength and heart enough to do it, Which you should finde; yet minded am I still (Though I am mov'd) to punish, not to kill. Yet breathes there to my knowledge many a man, That in his bloudy actions glory can; He thinks it honour to be said that he Was the destruction of some two or three. A brave tall man I promise ye, and may Take Tyburne for preferment in his way. What poore renown is there is in such a deed, For which a good mans heart would inly bleed? What valour's in't sith a poore flie or gnat Doth many times performe as much as that? But I perceive the chiefest cause of this, Th' opinion of the rascall Vulgar is. They puffe men up with their infectious breath, Till swoln it break out to their shame, or death. But though they think that he which kills his foe Is most couragious, Reason tells them no: For he that hath a heart that fact to doe Is both a Tyrant and a Coward too. But how is he a Coward (some will say) That takes in fight anothers life away? Thus he is one: He having by his might A power on him with whom he haps to fight, Thinks if he spare his life in such a case, He one day may revenge his foule disgrace; And that with feare of future dangers fills him, Which to prevent, he like a Coward kills him. Yet those whose present safety cannot be Without the ruine of their enemy, Blamelesse I count, fith nature gives us way, Things violent by violence to stay. Yet thou what e're thou be that hast a foe, Seek not to be his wilfull ouerthrow. Sith life's a matter of the greatest weight; If there be any way though ne're so straight, Whereby thou maist from such an act be free, Part not such friends as Soule and Body be. Rather if't may be, keep him living still, For foes oft prove a necessary ill. And for thy mercy thou shalt one day finde Much comfort and contentment in thy minde. Foes I have some, whose lives I do not grutch, For they have done me service very much, And will do still. These wheresoe'er I go, Do make me carefull what I speak or doe: And if I step aside have so much grace, To tell me all my folly to my face: Whereas my friend, till I were quite undone, VVould let me still in my old vainnesse run. Or, if he warne me, it is so in sport. That I am scarce a whit the better for't. But this good-evill few of us can use, For we do better things than these abuse. Mans natur's ill, and I have noted this, If we upbraided be with what's amisse, We cannot brook it, but are readier still To hate them that reprove, than mende what's ill: Nay, to the mildest sort men know not how To speak their mindes without exceptions now: We must not our mad lusty-blouds gain-say, No, not so much as in a yea, or nay; But presently we die for't, (if we will) They have both hand and heart prepar'd to kill. Let them but thinke a man to them injurious, Although he be not so, they'l straight grow furious, And are so quickly up in a Bravado, They are for nothing but the Imbrocado: And in this humor they respect not whether They be unto them friends or foes or neither; All are alike and their hot Choler ends Not onely love and friendship but their friends. I know twere vaine if I should tell to these The peacefull minde of ancient Socrates: Or if I should Lycurgus vengeance show, How he behav'd himselfe unto his foe. 'Twere but much labour lost; forthere's no doubt Our Bedlam Gallants would but grin and flout At their well-temper'd passions, sith they deem Nought but their brainlesse humours worth esteem. The small discretion that doth guide this age, Hath left them so to their unbridled rage That men most foolish desperate, who care For nought, but little wit enough to dare Some beast-like combate (without lawfull ground) Are now the onely men that are renown'd Amongst the vulgar. And forsooth, to gain A little fame that way, though ne'er so vain, They'l put their lives in danger: nay, there's some Had rather have it than the life to come. Alas, poore men, what hath bewitch't your mind? How are you grown so senselesse and so blinde, Thus to affect vain shadows, and let slide The truer substance as a thing unspi'd? Is Reason in you grown so great a stranger, To suffer an affection of such danger, To settle in you? Banish't from your brest, And there let mercy and forgivenesse rest; It is a token of a humane mildenesse: But vengeance is a signe of Brutish wildenesse, Not fitting any but the Tyger, Beare, Or such like creatures that remorselesse teare What ere they light on. Cast it from you then, Be in condition, as in shape ye'are Men, And stand unmov'd, for innocence ere long, Will shew herselfe abroad in spight of wrong: When of your patience you shall not repent, But be avenged to your own content. Yet some may say, the counsell I have given, Is hard to follow, strict, and too uneven; And whatsoever show I seem to make, Such as my selfe would hardly undertake. Know you that think so, I am not afraid, If that it be a burthen I have laid To bear't my selfe; nay, I have undergone, If this be hard, a more uneasie one. For, but of late a friend of mine in show, Being (indeed) a spightfull secret foe; I know not why, (for I did ne're in ought Wrong him so much as in a word or thought) Yet this man having wisely watcht his time, When I (a stranger in another Clime) Left mine own Countrey: did mean while repaire To my best friends, and with dissemblings faire, And shows of love and griefe, did there unfold The grossest slander ever villain told. A damn'd invention, so exceeding vile, That Gallants, 'twould have made your bloud to boil And out of your abused bodies start, I know it would have broken veins or heart. If you had felt that tongues envenom'd sting, You would have fret, fum'd, stampt, done any thing, Or angry, rag'd, like mad-men in your fit, Till mercilesse revenge had quenched it. And what did I? At first I must confesse, I was extreamly mov'd, who could be lesse? But when I felt my troubled thoughts begin To joyne with brutish Passion's force within, And raise disquiet humours in my breast, I fear'd if I should yeeld 'twould mar my rest. And therefore to my selfe I patience took, Which, whilst I have about me, I can brook Any misfortune. Then that patience Grew so much stronger through my innocence, That I, as much as flesh and bloud could do, Forgot both injurie and vengeance too. Yet might I wanted not to do him ill; All the defect that was, was in my will. It is well known the Coward dares not stand, T'abide the Vengeance of my wronged hand, Were his strength tripled: nay, were I in bands Of impotencie wrapt and had no hands. Yet I have friends (whom if I had not prai'd, And beg'd unto to have their fury stai'd) Had heapt confusion on him for my sake. Yea I am halfe perswaded he would quake A twelve-moneth after; had he but the daring To thinke upon the Vengeance was preparing For that lewd slanderous tale of his which he Aswell might raise on one unborne, as me. But when that course my Reason did gaine-say, I was allow'd Revenge a better way. Both Law and Iustice profer'd me the scourge, To whip him for it: which though friends did urge, (Shewing me motives to allure me to it) Yet was I much unwilling still to doe it: For though I might (beside submission) gaine No little summes, my heart doth much disdaine To adde unto my substance through his shame; Or raise it with the ruine of his fame. Yet cause perhaps there's some may thinke I faine, Or speake a matter fram'd out of my braine: Know; this backe-biter lives and may doe long To doe me more, and many others wrong. And but that I am loth to staine my Verse, The name of such a Monster to rehearse; For others satisfaction (to disgrace it) Vpon the Margent here my pen should place it. Yet that perhaps would Vengeance counted be, For that would never be reveng'd by me. Nor had I thus much said but to make knowne, So truly these opinions are mine owne, That I doe wish no other men unto, More then I gladly of my selfe would doe. Thus was I wronged and I thus withstood My own mad Passion in the heat of bloud: Yet thinke my selfe in as good case as those, That have reveng'd themselves with stabs and blows. In my opinion it is now as well As if that I should pack his soule to hell With danger of mine owne, and here remaine To grieve and wish he were alive againe; Nay, now 'tis best, for why? he may repent, Whil'st I with a safe conscience live content. But grant that some misdeem'd my innocence, (Because they saw that I with Patience Endur'd the wrong) by thinking I did know Myselfe in fault because I tooke it so: What's that to me? Indeed if all my care, But to make shew of what I should be were, I might be much displeased when I see Men thinke me not, what I would seeme to be. But he whose onely aime is Vertues path, And that true aime by his endeavour hath (Which God grant me) so much sweet comfort gains Within his conscience, that he nought complaines Of Mens opinions; but above them borne, Doth both their censures and supposings scorne. And why should I doe lesse who never weigh'd My innocence by that which others said? Whether I patient were, or storm'd at it It quits me of the slander ne'er awhit. He that condemnes my milde and gentle course, May in his wisdome light upon a worse. I must confesse I let his errour passe; Nor have I done amisse; for say an Asse Had struck me with his heels; how should I quit The harme he doth me? You would blame my wit If I should kill him. If I went to law Who would not count me the most Asse? a Daw, Or worst of fools? And pray, what were I lesse If I had don't to his unworthinesse? One that's so ignorant of his offence, He seems as if hee had no spark nor sense Of understanding: one, whom if I touch, Or offer to lay hands on, tis as much As if I in my anger would begin To break the stool that erst had broke my shin. In this and that I found the cause was one, And therefore did I let revenge alone: Onely I mark't him (for this cause indeed) That other men might (knowing him) take heed; And he himselfe, with a repining shame, Reading his follies Emblem in his name, Might grieve he did into that errour run. Which hoping he by this time now hath done, I cease to brand him, and forgive him too: Others might thus by my example do. But to thy task my Muse, for there remain Mad humours many more yet to explain; Such as are theirs who use to take in hand A lawlesse pilgrimage to Calice sand; And think if they by tricks can blinde the Law, Of God they never need to stand in awe. These onely deale in blows. But there be other Who their revengefull mindes as ill can smother; Yet cause they have not hearts to deale with swords, Like valiant Champions fight it out with words. Such fraies have made me oftentimes to smile, And yet they prove shrewd combates other-while: For from such brawls do sudden stabs arise, And sometimes in revenge the quart-pot flies; Ioyn'd-stools and glasses make a bustling rumour, Yea, this is grown a Gentle-man-like humour. But in my minde he that so well can fight, Deserveth to be dub'd an Alchouse-knight. Is't not a shame that men should at their meeting Welcome each other with a friendly greeting, As I have seen, and yet before they part, Bandy their swords at one anothers heart? Wondrous inhumane! Oh, the savage Bore, Or wilde Armenian herds can do no more: But such beleeve not it is God hath said, Vengeance is mine and I will see't repaid. For if they did they would not dare to be Such carvers for themselves as now we see. No good remaines, if long this fit endure, Friendship is quite extinguished: and sure The Devill doth so much possesse them than, They have no honest thought of God or man: Which you may note, if you do ever see Two hare-brain Ruffians when at ods they be, All th' ones ambition is the others fall, Without compassion or respect at all. Which fury so unlimited doth prove, They have to man-ward not a sparke of love: Nor no regard of God shall you espie, If you observe their damned blasphemy, When Standers by would stop their bloudy will; Stark mad with rage, the heav'ns wide eares they fill With horrid, bloudy, fearefull cannon-oathes, Such as no honest Christian man but loathes Almost to heare them nam'd. Yea seeme to teare Christs man-hood peece-meale from him when they sweare For foote, heart, nailes, still using God withall Their fowle-mouth'd-rackets, like a tennis-ball Doe bandy to and fro: His bloud and wounds, Adde to their hellish bravings such strange sounds, As if the powers of heaven they did contemne, And meant in this wilde fit to challenge them. Oh base proud clay! who by their deeds can gather These men beleeve a power above, but rather That they are viler than the brutest creature: For that is taught more reverence by nature. But these bold Champions dare him: yea when they Cannot have Vengeance their desired way (As if they scorn'd the threatning of his rod) Thus thinke they to avenge themselves on God; Who were he not as mercifull as just, Might with a blast consume them into dust. Of Choler. Satyre 6. Bvt now the cause of mans Revengefull thirst Proceeds from rash unbridled Choler first: Which Passion flowes from imbecility, And bring us unto much absurdity: Yea, those that are infected with this crime, Are (in a manner) mad-men for the time. 'Tis a short Fury, wherewith man possest, Resembles most a wilde untamed beast. It makes the wisest so beside their wit, They speake and practise many a thing unfit: Yea, those in whom I finde this Passion raigne, I have oft seene to storme for things but vaine; And chasing fret at poore halfe-penny losses, As if for some intolerable crosses. In a slight trifle or some flender toy, You would suppose consisted all their joy: For should a wise man every sorrow prove This world could heape, it would not so much move His setled patience as one Rascall fit Would on no ground in these distemper it. There is this weakenesse, which in Cholerick men, I have observed raigning now, and then, They are not onely ready to beleeve The least report that may occasion give Of discontents; but so doth anger blinde them, As, if no causes be, they'l seeke to finde them, And (in light matters, if they should contend) Would pick a quarrell with their dearest friend. Yea, I have seen where friends, (nay more) where brothers That be, or should be, dearer far than others, Have in their heat of anger, turned foes, And mixed strange words with far sharper blowes. Nor doe, nor can they in this humour spare Any degree. For reverence nor care Doth them remaine; although they be most sure Their heedlesse words not foes alone procure, But lose their friends: nor doe they in that case, Respect the time, nor company, nor place. Besides, there is this over-sight in some (Where Choler doth the Reason overcome) They doe not onely blame him that offends, But are displeas'd even with their dearest friends; And with the like displeasure do pursue All that are in their presence or their view. Yet if that any should but tell these men Such anger were without just reason, then, Although it be so, and they know it right. Their fury would the more increase with spight: They cannot bear controule; neither can they Brook him ought better that doth nothing say; For then indeed they presently suspect, He carelesly their anger doth neglect. Some Masters and some Tutors I espie Too much orecome with this infirmity. They are so hot and confident in this, That all their anger still with reason is: As if they think their servants do offend, They must not their suspected crimes defend, Guilty or no; but yeeld to all they say What-ever shame or wrong betide them may. And so be sure to make it an offence, Though but by wronging their own innocence, Which is meer tyranny. And he that can Force to such slavery the minde of man, By my opinion shall for ever passe For an imperious, foolish, wayward Asse, Who looks so much what duty others owe, That he himselfe doth scarcely manners know. This Anger is a wondrous head-strong Passion, And hath a beastly frantick operation; From which how can we any man release, When we must neither speak nor hold our peace? Some will be angry if they cannot make All others their opinions undertake. But let them keep from me, or I should chaufe them, For out of that fond humour I would laugh them. Others have meanings but they cannot show them. And therefore fret at all that do not know them. And I have seene (that anger may be holy) A good man moved for anothers folly. The hurt that through this Passion doth ensue Is great although observ'd by very few. For that which hath ensu'd on one mans spleene, The ruine of a State hath often beene. And therefore (though I none excuse the while,) I hold it much lesse seemely and more vile In men authoriz'd, than in those that be Borne to a lower fortune or degree, For, when this fit possesseth private men, They trouble but themselves; or now and then Their private families: when if it ceaze On eminent and mighty personages. It doth distemper thousands and thereby Whole Provinces do oft oppressed lye. In my opinion, hee's unfit to weeld The sword of Iustice, that doth basely yeeld To such a brutish Passion: howsoe'er In other things he most sufficient were: Though some in places of esteeme there be, Whom therewith strangely overcome we see. Oh why should they to governe others fit Who know not how to rule themselves as yet? The angry and incensed Magistrate, On them to be aveng'd whom he doth hate For private causes, drawes the publike sword; And all extremity the Lawes afford He makes to serve his rage. And if that faile, Hee'l straine his conscience, but he will prevaile. But divers thinke, that such as hasty be, (For so they title this infirmitie) Best-natur'd are. But yet I see not how, I that Position may for truth allow. For, (whosoere 'twas first that saying taught) If they are best, I'le sweare the best is naught. Moreover, there be many doe suppose, It is a signe of courage. What meane those? Where is their judgment? they me thinks should gather That it were weakenesse did produce it rather: Or else, why should the feeble and the sick, Women and Children be most cholerick? Againe, there's some whose judgement is as rude As to suppose it quickens Fortitude. Which cannot be; for they must grant me then, That Vice, assist to perfect Vertue can: Which I cannot beleeve nor come to see How fortitude and anger can agree. For one a resolution is that's steady, And rul'd by reason, th' other rash and heady: Yea, th' one doth nothing but on consultation, The other cannot take deliberation, But head-long unadvisedly doth tend, Till it in sorrow, shame or ruine end. And though some thence much help would seeme gather To whet true valour on; it hinders rather: Yea so unreasonable is this Passion, It overthrowes in man all seemely fashion; Making him speake if ought but discontent him, Yea doe the thing of which he shall repent him: And such a dangerous kinde of Lunatick Is he who useth to be Cholerick That of a friend if I might chuser be, I'd rather have a man that's mad than he. Yet men doe rarely seeke to stop this ill But as they grow in yeares, that groweth still. As if it were a humour whence could rise, Not any thing which them might prejudice. And they so yeeld themselves to the invasion Of this strange frenzy on the least occasion: That when they thinke the fury to suppresse Of this disease, they can doe nothing lesse. For he that will a certaine med'cine finde For such a malady must have a minde Setled in good, and an unfain'd intent To prosecute what he in shew hath meant. Light trust he must not give to all reports, Nor take too much delight in idle sports. On toyes his love should never so be set, To make him for their absence grieve or fret. He must be wary still, not to adore Treasure or Honours (heapt upon him) more Than will befit such things as needs must perish, For oft that folly doth this Passion cherish. Let Dogs, nor Hawkes, nor any pleasure move, But as it doth indifferent things behooue. At no time let him rashly speake or doe, What selfe-conceit doth urge or prompt him to, And not alone this my advice embrace, But learne of Cotis, that wise King of Thrace, Who having many precious vessels sent Of britle metall (fearing discontent) Might for their losse another day arise The Messenger he richly gratifies; And then before his face against the stones Dashes the costly present for the nones: To shew that those, who angers flames would hinder Must first remove the Fuell and the Tinder. Of Iealousie. Satyre VII. Bvt though these angrie ones soon bread a braul, And are pernicious to converse withall; Not one jot better is the jealous head, That ever seares his wife hath wrong'd his bed. Sometime this Passion (as it may appeare) Proceeds out of a too much love, with feare, Sometime again the mischiefe doth arise, When he that worth in his beloved spies, Is forced that deserving to confesse, And privy to a selfe-unworthinesse. Which is indeed the cause that brings the smart Of Iealousie upon the greatest part. The first is seldomest, and it is sent Of God, as a peculiar punishment To those who do the creature so affect, As thereby their Creatour they neglect. Love is the highest and the noblest blisse. That for mankinde on earth ordained is: But when true measure it exceeds, and gets Beyond the decent bounds that reason sets, God turnes it to a plague, whereby he will Shew them their folly, and correct the ill. He adds, a feare of losing of their joy In that they love: which quickly doth destroy All their delight; and strewing good with ill, Makes things seem lost though they are with th? still Thus doth it oftentimes with that man prove Who keeps not moderation in his love. He having got a wife not onely faire, But modest, honest, wise and debonaire, At first so wondrous meritorious deems her, As worthy all affection he esteems her, And waxeth so assur'd hee dares be bold She will not be allur'd to ill by gold, Honour, nor beauty: but as she is chast, So is perswaded will be to the last. And to himselfe so well doth seem to thrive, He thinks his own the happiest choise alive. All which is good, and if no more I tell, You cannot say wherein he doth not well: But there he doth not his affection stay, Further it tends, and further it will stray This man not having learned to possesse With temperance so great a happinesse; Oft his affections grow to that extreame, As well he knows not if he wake or dreame, Then doth his Love, (such love will ever do it) For a Companion take in Feare unto it. A feare of losing what he loves so much: And then the nature of this feare is such, That it begets suspect; which creeping in, Doth by a little at the first begin To make him doubt his Spouse may loosely live. But then her well-known vertuous minde doth give Such blamelesse testimony of her good, As that surmise is for a time withstood, Till this disease upon him growes more strong, Then he begins to think she doth him wrong: Which if he doe, that one false thought's enough To give all former truthes the overthrow. And why? Suspect grows thereupon so great, She thrusts true judgment quite besides her seat. Which being done, then straight begins to wane The good conceit he of his blisse had tane: His onely labour's how to bring't about, To be assur'd of what he seeketh out. A Cuckold he esteemes himselfe, and he Were e'en as good indeed a Cuckold be: Nay, rather than he'll be deceiv'd, the elfe Will try to make a Cuckold of himselfe. In borrowed shapes to bed her he will trie; Sometimes he courts her by a deputy: And if all fail to tempt her unto ill; Yet, he remains himselfe a Coxcombe still. For if his friend do to his house repaire, He thinks tis onely 'cause his wise is fair: Or if a stranger come he'le pawn his life All his intent is to corrupt his wife: Yea, though the businesse to himselfe he finde, He thinks 'tis but a Hood to keep him blinde. Thus all the sweet he had is turn'd to sowre, Fain would he think well, but hath not the power; Much care torments his heart, and yet he will Be prying farther to increase it still: Yea, he will seek, although he truly know, The more he seeks, the more he findes his woe. Besides, Suspect reviveth in the head All things that may be mis-interpreted; And the best thought her vertue's like to win Is onely this; It serv'd to cloak her sinne. In briefe, his former love he marreth quite, And there he loathes, where once he took delight But wherefore? onely 'cause he doth mistrust, And not on any proofe that shee's unjust. Vnhappy man, thus thy ill nature shall Convert the hony of thy life to gall. And haplesse woman she that comes to wed So meere a sot, and such a jealous head; An Owl-ey'd buzzard that by day is blinde, And sees not things apparant, yet can finde That out which never was. The feare to lose The jewell he above all gemmes did choose; That feare, I say, of wit doth so bereave him, He thinks that's gone which means not yet to leave him. Oh, foolish man, that having gain'd a blisse, Dost make't a curse, by using it amisse; If judgment be not blinded in thee, look; Try if thou hast not all this while mistook: Is not thy wife still faire? and to the eye Seems she not yet to have that modesty Thou didst commend her for? Is she not wary With whom she walks, or speaks, or where to tarry: Is she not still as carefull how to please; As loving too as in her former daies? In shew he sees it, but he thinks 'tis fein'd. Out blockish dolt that art most justly pain'd: Thou but a few supposed shadows hast That makes thee to account thy wife unchast; But many firme substantiall proofes make cleare That shee's unstain'd, and ought to be as deare As e're she was: Why then should faults in thee Make her seeme evill untill such she be? A woman that is faire shall much be view'd, And have perhaps unlook't-for favours shew'd. She shall be courted wher'er she will or no; Nay, be resorted to: and though she show Scarcely so much as common courtesies, Shee shall be censur'd by mis-judging eyes, And false reports will flie: But what of this? Wilt thou that hast had triall what she is, And never knewst her erre, wilt thou, I say, Cast all the good conceit thou hadst away, And straight grow jealous, trusting the surmise Of the lew'd Vulgar more than thine own eies? It were mad folly; and yet I do know Some that are thus besotted: more's their wo. And pitty 'twere but they had horned him, Wer't not a greater pitty so to sinne. Should you but sit with such an one at table, To hold from laughter you were scarcely able, To see what note the jealous Woodcock takes Of his wives words, and every look she makes; In what a feare he eats his meat, and drinks, What signes he uses, how he nods and winks, With twenty scurvy gestures, though he see No reason he should so suspicious be. Now some have cause enough, and I beleeve Such seem to have a colour why they grieve. But yet ther's no just reason any one Should over-strive to hold what will be gone, Vexing himselfe so for anothers ill, Which he can never help. Let him that will. This I know true, to seek much to restrain A womans will, is labour spent in vain; And he that tries to do it might have bin One of the Crew that bedg'd the Cuckow in. Why should a man go put himselfe to pain, As some have done, a businesse to fain? And then at night come lurk about his house, Where be it but the stirring of a Mouse He doth observe it: Wherefore doth he so? Since, if thereby he ought amisse do know, The greatest good that he shall hereby finde, Is more vexation to molest his minde: For then the mischiefe he but fear'd before, Hee's certain of, and need not doubt it more. A goodly meed: but sure those wretched elves, Take pleasure in tormenting of themselves. They hearken, watch, set spies, and alway long To heare some tales or inkling of their wrong. And he that can but whisper some such fable, Shall be the welcom'st guest that sits at table. (Though it be ne'er so false) they love so well To feel the torture of this earthly hell. But I do muse what Devill keeps their heart, They should affect the causes of their smart; Those ever-buzzing-deadly-stinging flies; Those that of Ecchoes onely can devise A slander 'gainst thy selfe. What e're they say, Thy love from her thou must not draw away On bare reports. Thou must behold the crime, Or keep her as thy best belov'd her time. Better or worse, thou surely must abide her, Till from thy selfe the death of One divide her. Then tell me, were it not (by much) lesse pain A good opinion of her to retain? Could'st thou not be contented by thy will, At least to think that she were honest still? Yes, in thy heart I know thou would'st be glad, Vnlesse that thou wert void of sense, or mad. Why, shake off all these claw-backs then that use Thy soon-beleeving nature to abuse; For (trust me) they are but some spightfull elves, Who 'cause they have not the like blisse themselves, Would fain mar thine; or else I dare be bold, If thou the truth couldst warily unfold, They are some lust-stung Villaines that did court Thy honest wife to some unlawfull sport: And finding her too chast to serve their turne, Whose evill hearts with foule desires did burne; To spight her (being farre more evill doers Than Daniels Elders, faire Susanna's wooers) To thee they do accuse her of an ill, Whereto they labour'd to allure her will. Let me advise thee then, what e're he be That of such dealings first informeth thee. Believe him not what proofes soe're he bring, Do not give eare to him for any thing: And though he be the nearest friend thou hast, From such like knowledge shut all sense up fast; Flie and avoid him as thou wouldst the Devill, Or one that brings thee messages of evill. Let him be to thee as thy deadliest foe, A Fury, or some one thou loath'st to know. And be assured, whatsoe'er he shewes, He is no friend of thine that brings that newes; Sith if that thou wert his most deadly foe; For any wrong it were revenge enough. Now some men I have noted love as well The husbands faults unto the wife to tell, And aggravate them too: as if thereby They either meant to feed their jealousie, Or else stir up their unbeseeming hates, Against their guiltlesse welbeloved mates. But of these monsters (fairest Sex) beware, Of their insinuations have a care: Beleeve them not, they will coyne tales untrue, To sow foule strife betwixt your loves and you Out of ill-will: or else here is my doome, They hope to get into your husbands roome, Through the advantage of the discontent They would work in you. But this their intent They'l so disguise, that you shall never spie it, Till you are snar'd too surely to deny it. But oh! consider you, whose excellence Had reasonable once for difference, This Passion well: if ill your Spouses do, Amend your selves, and they'l grow better too. Look not upon them with o'er-blinded eyes, Nor grieve you them with causelesse jealousies: For most of them have ever this condition, Though they are bad they cannot brook suspition. Strive not with them too much. For as the Powder Being fast stopt, makes the report the louder, Sending the bullet with the greater force: So he that seeks to barre a womans course, Makes her more eager, and can ne'er out-strive her, But on she will because the Devill doth drive her. Let those then that thus matched are, begin By love and gentle means their wives to win. And though no hope they see, yet patience take, So there is none shall know their heads do ake. And let all wary be that no surmises, Or flying tale some envious head devises, Make them to wrong their chast and modest wives, Who have with vertue led unspotted lives: For though they stand unmov'd, yet that's the way To make a woman soonest go astray. And so I will conclude these jealous humours, Which part I found b'experience, part by rumours; I feel it not, yet know it is a smart That plagues the minde, and doth torment the heart. And I could wish but for the others sake, Their thoughts-tormenting-pain might never slake: For, none's so jealous, I durst pawn my life, As he that hath defil'd anothers wife. Of Covetousnes. Satyre 8. Bvt how mist I of Avarice to tell, Whose longing is as infinite as hell? There is no Passion that's more vile or base, And yet as common as to have a face, I muse it scap't so long, for I'le be plain, I no where look but there I see it reigne. In all this spacious Round I know so few That can this slavish dung-hill vice eschew; I neither will excuse sex nor degree, Young folks, nor such as middle-aged be. Nay, I perceive them given most to crave, When they had need to dig themselves a grave. Like earth-bred Moles still scrambling in the dust, Not for the treasure that shall never rust, But for vile cankred drosse is all their care, As if the same their Summum bonum were: When all that they have with their labour bought (If well consider'd) is not worth a thought. I have known Chuffes, that having well to live, Sufficient also both to lend and give, Yet nathelesse, toyl, moyl, and take more pain Than a Iews bond-slave, or a Moore in Spain. All day they brook the rain, hail, frost and snow, And then, as if they had not drudg'd enough, They lie and think all night with care and sorrow, How they may take as little rest to morrow. 'Tis strange their mindes so much for gold doth itch, And being gotten, that it should bewitch: For 'tis by nature in a prison pent, Vnder our feet i'th basest Element: And should wee pluck't from dungeon, filth, &amp; mire, To giv't the chiefest seat in our desire? 'Twere want of judgment; which brave spirits know, Counting it base with those that prize it so. I've heard those say that travell to the West Whence this beloved metall is encreast, That in the places where such Minerals be, Is neither grasse, nor herbe, nor plant, nor tree. And like enough; for this at home I finde Those who too earnestly employ the minde About that trash, have hearts (I dare uphold) As barren as the place where men dig gold. This humour hath no bounds; 'tis a desire (Or disease rather) nothing can expire: 'Tis hell, for had it all the world, why yet 'Twould long as much as if't had ne'er awhit; And I with pitty do lament their pain Who have this never-quenched thirst of gain; This ever-gaping whirle-poole, that receives Still, yet the selfe-same roome still empty leaves. Hee's mad that food to such a Vulture gives That's never full: and ev'n as good fill sives. Or vessells bottomlesse, as still endeavour To gorge a Monster that will hunger ever. All that men can perform will be in vain, And longing will for evermore remain. Like those foule issues that must still have vent, Till strength of nature and the life be spent. It makes men tire themselves like him that drinks Brine, or salt-water, and still thereby thinks To slake his thirst, although he feel it more Augmented at each draught than 'twas before. Yea, wealth doth as much lessen this desire Of Avarice in men, as flames of fire Alay the heat: Besides, though they have store, This makes them to themselves exceeding poore. And howsoever they may seem, yet such Vntill their dying-day are never rich. They very seldome have respect or care To promise or religion: they'l not spare To wrong their neighbour, friend, or God himselfe, Thereby to adde unto their cursed pelfe. They neither reverence the right of laws; Nor are they touched with the poore mans cause. They could be well content to shed their blouds, Lose soule and heaven but to save their goods. To talk to them of better things twere vain, For they are onely capable of gain. They never live in true society, Nor know they friendship, love, or piety. And in a word those that are thereby led Never do good till they be sick or dead. And therfore with those vermine we may place them That serve us to no use till wee uncase them. And I've observ'd that such mens children be Borne many times to greatest miserie. For they have neither meanes nor education According to their kindred, state, or nation; Whereby we see that they do often run Into vile actions, and are quite undone. And then perhaps the Parent grieves at this, But ne'er considers that his fault it is. 'Tis greedinesse that makes a man a slave To that which for his servant he should have: And teaches him oft to esteem of more The vicious Rich-man, than the honest-poore. How many in the world now could I name Injurious villaines; that but to defame Or spight their neighbour, would their God forswear As if they thought that no damnation were? (Provided when they thus their conscience strain It be out of a hatred, or for gain.) Yea, there be idle theeving drones a many, That have no vertue (nor will ne'er have any) That for their wealth shall highly be respected, When honest men (their betters) are neglected: And then we also see that most men do Impose such worthy titles on them too, That such base scums shall oft intreated be With, Good your worship, and with cap and knee. But sure the world is now become a gull To think such scoundrels can be worshipfull. For in these dayes, if men have gotten riches, Though they be Hangmen, Vsurers, or Witches, Devils-incarnate, such as have no shame To act the thing that I should blush to name; Doth that disgrace them any whit? Fie no; The world ne'er meant to use her Minions so. There is no shame for Rich-men in these times, For wealth will serve to cover any crimes. Wert thou a Crook-back't Dwarfe, deform'd in shape Thyrsites-like, condition'd like an Ape; Did'st never do a deed a good man ought, Nor spake true word, nor hadst an honest thought; If thou be rich, and hap to disagree With one that's poore, although indeed he be In every part a man; and hath a spirit That's truly noble, worthy well to merit Ev'n praise of Envy; yet if thou wilt seem A man far worthier, and of more esteem, Although thou canst invent no means to blame him, Yet I can tell a trick how thou shalt shame him: And that's but this, Report that he is poore, And there is no way to disgrace him more. For, so this Passion doth mens judgment blinde, That him in whom they most perfection finde, If so he be not rich they count him base; And oft hee's fain to give a Villain place. Moreover, the desire to gain this pelfe, Makes many a brave man to forget himselfe. Some I have known that for their worthy parts, Their vertue and their skill in many Arts, Deserved honour; and (if any can Iudge by the outward look the inward man) They to command m? (you would think) were born, And seem'd a slavish servitude to scorn, Yet have I seen when such as these (alas!) In hope of gain have croucht unto an Asse; Observ'd a Dolt, and much debas'd their merits To men of vulgar and ignoble spirits. How many of our finest wits have spent Their times and studies in meere complement; Greasing with praises many a fat-fed Bore, Of whom the world hath thought too well before? How many now that follow'd Mars his troop, Whom force of death could never make to stoop? How many also of our great Divines, That should seek treasure not in earthly mines, Descend to basenesse and against the haire (As goes the common Proverb) can speake faire? Flatter for gaine and humour such base groomes As are not wovthy of their horse-boyes roomes? They wrong themselves: but those are counted wise That now adaies know how to temporize. Yet I abhorr'd it ever and I vow; Ere I to any golden Calfe will bow, Flatter against my conscience, or else smother What were to be reveal'd to please another: Ere I for gaine would fawne upon a Clowne, Or feed Great fooles with tales of the renowne Of their reputed fathers, when (God mend them) Themselves have nothing why we should commend them: Or e're I'd coine a lie be't ne'er so small, For e'er a bragging Thraso of them all In hope of profit: I'd give up my play, Begin to labor for a groat a day; In no more cloathing than a mantle goe; And feed on Sham-rootes, as the Irish doe. For what contentment can in riches be, Vnlesse the body and the minde be free? But tush: what's freedome look where gold beares sway, It takes all care of what is fit away; Corrupts the Iudgement and can make the lawes Oft-times to favour an ungodly cause. Moreover, worldly men doe so affect, Where wealth abounds, and beare so much respect To those that have it, that their vice they deeme To be a vertue, and so make it seeme. For, say they use extortion, no men more, Vndoe their Country, hurt and wrong the poore, Be such damn'd Vsurers, they keepe a house That yeelds not crummes enough to feed a Mouse; Yet they'l not say they are covetous; oh no, But thrifty and good wary men, or so. Another though in pride he doth excell; Be more ambitious than the Prince of Hell; If his apparell be in part like us, Italian, Spanish, French and Barbarous; Although it be of twenty severall fashions, All borrowed from as many severall Nations; Yet hee's not vaine nor proud; What is he then? Marry a proper, fine, neat Gentleman. Or if there be a Ruffian that can swagger, Make strange brauadoes, weare an Ale-house-dagger, Instead of valour, quarrelling professe, Turne Hospitality to lewd excesse; Quaffe Soule-sicke healths untill his eies doe stare, Sing baudy Songs and Rounds, and curse and sweare; Though he use gaming, as the Cards and Dice, So out of measure that hee mak't a vice; Convert his house into a loathsome stewes, Keep whores and knaves and baudes (and that's no newes) Yet if he be a rich man, what is he? A rude ranke Ruffian, if he aske of me. A Ruffian? Gup Iack-sauce-box with a wannion, Nay hee's a merry and a boone Companion. This is the worlds milde Censure. Yet beside, Another quality I have espide. For that disease in which they shun the poore, They doe abhorre a rich man ne'er the more. Him I have knowne that hath disdain'd to sup Water or beere out of a poore-mans cup, For feare of poysoning or some thing as bad, Although he knew no malady he had; Yet have I often seene that curious Asse Pledging a rich-man in the selfe-same glasse, When he hath knowne the party sweating lie Of the abhorred French foule malady. Which proves this Proverbe true; Birds of a feather Will fearelesse use to flocke and feed together. But I oft wonder and doe yet admire, Men hunt for riches with such strange desire. For being once possest thereof it fils The owners of it with a thousand ils, More than they can conceive. For first we finde It choakes and marres the vertue of the minde. Then (by much businesse) it brings annoies Vnto the minde; and hinders truer joyes From seating there &amp; though some stormes it cleare It drives men into flouds of greater feare: That oft the rich are more in sorrow tost, Than those that have no riches to be lost. But further over and above all this, Hence a much greater disadvantage is; It makes us to grow arrogant, unjust; Drawes unto pleasure and provokes to lust: More powerfull in a deed of villanie, Than helpefull in a worke of honesty. It ne'er contents the owners that enjoy it; And those that have it many times imploy it To corrupt justice, or else to allure Matrons or Virgins to an act impure. It hireth murtherers, makes men seditious, Full of suspect and envy or ambitious: It breedeth claw-backs, pick-thanks, flattery, Makes many theeves and causeth perjury. It hinders knowledge; for most that have lands, Live neither by their wisdome nor their hands, But following sloth and pleasure hate the schooles, To leave much wealth unto a race of fooles. This is the fruit of riches, which alone Is now the faire reward that every one Endevours for; and that which to attaine, (Or keepe once gotten) none refuseth paine, Labour nor danger, nay oft men expresse In the pursute thereof, such earnestnesse, As if that onely did indeed appeare The speciall end that they were plac'd for here. Oh Gold! what mortall god is so divine? What beauty is there so ador'd as thine? The fairest creature never so much mov'd, As that it was of every one belov'd. The little infant in his cradle lying, One promise of a penny staies his crying: Those that in youth for nothing seeme to care, To keepe thee still their friend, respective are. Old dotards almost dropt into the grave, That neither sense of sight nor hearing have Are by their touching thee preserv'd alive, And will maintaine thou art restorative. Fooles that know nothing, know the use of thee, And for thy sake will oft perswaded be. The wise men of the World that disapprove Young mens affections and make scoffes at love; He, who out of his judgement cals him Asse, That dotes upon the beauty of a face, Can play the Idiot twice as much himselfe, By doting on a heape of duty pelfe. Nay further, to their conscience I appeale That seeme nought else almost but faith and Zeale, Whether with all their show of Sanctity, They doe not oft commit Idolatry, And this great Mammon secretly adore: I feare they doe, and more his helpe implore Than their Creator's. For this cursed Riches So much the soule of every man bewitches, That very oft times they forgetfull be Of what beseemes profession and degree. What He, on earth, so great or mighty is, (Or who so proud) that will not bow to this? Where's he though Noble that will now disdaine To be a suter for his private gaine? See we not those that seem'd to looke more hie, Turne all their worship to this Deitie? It is apparant, Great men that were wont For honour onely, in times past to hunt, Both pawne and forfeit it for Riches sake: And they whose glory 'twas to undertake Such things as might their Country benefit, Seeke rather now how they may begger it. What Monopolies, what new tricks can they Find to increase their profit every day? What Rascall poling sutes doe they devise, To adde new Summes unto their Treasuries? Which had their noble Predecessors sought, Such meanes of gaine for ever had beene thought Dishonour, and a staine of Infamie Enough to taint their whole Posteritie. And then, beside their ever shamelesse craving, They oft times also are as basely saving: And so much doth their avarice abate Of that becomming and commended state Which their fore-fathers kept; they would not know them (If they were living) or for shame not owe them. Those that have much on Ancient gentry stood, And will to this day glory in their bloud, Doe not disdaine (if there be wealth) to grace With their dear'st issue some ranke peasants rac Or take himselfe (if there be wealth to wed) An old Mechanick widdow to his bed. The childe for this, the parent will undoe: And parents sell the childs contentment too. It is of power sufficient to preferre The untaught sonne of a rude Scavenger, To some Lords daughter and in twelve-moneths can Make a known peasant deem'd a Gentleman. Beare Armes confirm'd, and shew a pedigree Shall from before the Norman Conquest be. And in his pride, some one for gentry brave Vnto whose father, his was sworne a slave. Nay so much sway the love of gold doth beare, He that but sonne unto the hangman were, A noted villaine of as false a heart, As ever rode to Tyburne in a Cart, One whom that place had long time groned for, And all men as earth's scum did most abhorre; Yet if this rake-hell could but thrive so much By any villanie, as to be rich One yeere or two, would not alone agen Get him more credit than three honest men; But great ones would salute and speake him faire, Labour how they might be inscrib'd his heire; And still observe him so obsequiously, As if the world within his gift did lie. Or which is more, he that once scorn'd to see Himselfe attended, by such groomes as he, Will yeeld this beast his only child should wed, And force her peradventure to his bed. Where spight of Vertue this damn'd ruffian shall Vnworthily, enjoy a blisse which all The most deserving of the Land would woe. (And when he hath her once, despise her too) But doubtlesse, if he can but at his death, When he is forc't to leave the world, bequeath A petty legacy unto the poore; Somewhat to stay the railing of his whore; And leave rich heires behind: why then the Asse, On a faire pile of Marble, Iet and Brasse, Shall have a Table faire engrav'd, to shew A Catalogue of Vertues he nere knew. Thus much can gold performe, and such you see The goodly fruits of this foule Passion be: That were there not a greater power which still A secret judgement heaped on this ill; It were enough to make all men despise The love of Vertue, and nought else devise Save to be rich: which way they soone may finde, That thereto onely doe apply the minde. But as herein men often doe amisse, So are they in the opposite to this; The Prodigall runs out as farre astray From this absurdity another way. And e'en as greedy men are set on fire With an unquenched and a foule desire Of hoording Riches (God in heaven amend them) So doth he strive and hie as fast to spend them. And as the first in elder folks is stronger, This raignes most violently in the younger, Their humors diverse. Some vaine-glorious asses, Consum't in gaudy cloathes and looking-glasses, Others blowne up e'en with the selfe same bellowes, Seeke to obtaine the love of all good-fellowes: These at the Ale-house have their daily pots, Though they be there or no, and looke what shots Are in their presence, spent though ne'er so many He doth them wrong that thinks to pay a penny. These feast at Tavernes their supposed friends That pay with Thanks, We ne'er shall make amends. Yea, and in more things they have lavish bin; But those are paths I've no experience in. Yet such no doubt e're many yeeres be past, Will wish that they had held their purses fast, When for their kindnesse and their former cheere, They hardly shall procure a cup of Beere. But there must needs be some men borne thereto, Or how the Divell shall our sharkers doe? Yet can I not say rightly that these be From Avarice and greedinesse quite free: For though they doe consume it knavishly, And spend on vaine pleasures lavishly, They gladly would their evill course maintaine, And therefore over slip no meanes of gaine. Some have bin forc'd to (through this indiscretion) Secret and open Robberies, Oppression, And diuers tricks: which shew the Spending vice May have a reference to Avarice. Others there are (but few) who having store, Neglect their wealth and rather would be poore; And why? It stops the way to heaven they say: Sure, being misimploied, so it may. And therefore rather than they should abuse it, 'Twere good they had it that knew how to use it. For such are lightly weake in resolution, And men but of a simple constitution; Or else by some seducing Villaine taught, That their goods rather than their good have sought. Now I suppose the man that well obtaines His wealth and in an honest calling gaines, More wisdome shewes in using it aright, Than such a Cynicke that contemnes it quite: Men will be in extreames; but sure the lesse Is to neglect wealth: for much greedinesse Makes not the body onely leane and foule, But also spreads infection to his soule, And clogs her so with things of no account, That she is over-poiz'd too much to mount. But those men that doe goe astray are loth, Must use endeavours to avoide them both. Of Ambition. Satyre 9. Here next to be arraign'd a Monster stands, Worse than the Giant with the hundred hands Stay you that seeke or love the peace of man, And I'le describe his nature if I can. This is the same that we doe call Ambition, The principallest stirrer of sedition. 'Tis a proud humour which doth ever search The stout-high-minded, and attempts to pearch In men of spirit. It doth farre surmount The force of Love and makes but small account Of Nature or Religion. Tis not law, Nor Conscience that can keepe this fiend in awe. It is supposed that it hath no bound; For never was there limit in it found. And such are these in whom it overswaies, No strength of reason there aspiring staies. Till like the fire whose fuell quite is spent, They flash and die for want of nourishment. There's no estate contents them; peace and strife Are both alike to them: yea death and life, Wives, children, friends, no, none but such as may Be unto their Ambitious plots a stay Shall be respected, and so they may reape What they desire they will not stick to heape Murther on murthers: yea, and think't no sinne, Be it of strangers or their nearest kinne: They have such flinty-breasts they can out-beard Danger it selfe and be no whit afeard. Yea, (maugre all their daring) just Confusion Of such proud spirits proves the said Conclusion. And he that first was ruin'd by this evill, Was he that first was guilty of't, the Devill: Who did aspire so high that higher Powers Wrought his just fall, and now he seeketh ours. Ev'n he first shed this ill into our breasts, Thereby to hinder and disturbe our rests. This most unreasonable, strong desire, And too exccessive longing to aspire To honour and promotion (which indeed Doth from a sottish, ignorance proceed) Is both a wilde and a disordred Passion, And a great enemy to Contentation. For whatsoever state man hath attain'd. 'Tis e'en as if that he had nothing gain'd; Sith he thereby hath still a farther scope, And never reaches to the end of's hope. That which he doth possesse he nought respecteth, But altogether things unknowne affecteth, And counts them best; which whatsoever they seem'd Being once gotten too, are not esteemd. Now, what's the reason that they doe abhor The things possest that they have labour'd for? What may the cause be that they doe contemne (Or cannot use things) having gained them? Sure hence it is; They doe not truly know What the things are that they doe long for so, And they obtaine them oft, ere they have might Or knowledge how to governe them aright. Had many of our reaching Yeomanry, That have grown wealthy through good husbandry, (And some of our proud Gentry that have sought Titles and undeserved Honours bought) But knowne before hand what disgracefull shame And beggery would follow on the same, In knowing not, to what they did aspire; Those Dignities had yet beene to desire: And so indeed they might have walkt the street, And not have fear'd the Counters nor the Fleet; Or might with Good-man have contented bin, Where now there's scarce a good man of the kin. Ambitious men will ever envious be, Regarding neither love nor amity; And though that they may make a goodly show, With reason it can never stand I know They should be faithfull or with justice deale, Either for Prince or Friend or Common-weale. For why? this humour makes them to attend, Yea all their labours, and best counsell spend In their owne plots: and so they have no losse, They care not whose proceedings they doe crosse. Vertuous endeavours this doth also let; Yea, makes men many a good thing to forget. And though I'me loth to speake it, I protest I thinke it raignes not in the Clergie least. For you at first great humblenesse shall see, While their estates and fortunes meaner be. They are industrious and take pains to teach, And twice a week shall be the least they'l preach: Or in their poverty they will not stick For Catechising, visiting the sick, With such like sacred works of piety As do belong to that fraternity. But if they once atchieve a Vicarage, Or be inducted to some Parsonage, Men must content themselves, and think it well If once a Month they heare the Sermon-bell. And if to any higher place they reach, Once in a twelve-month is enough to preach. Alas! we must consider that Devotion Is but a busie thing that lets Promotion; And if that they should give their mindes to't all, Who should have greater places when they fall? No, no, 'twere fitter they their ease did take, And see what friends and Patrons they can make For the next Bishoprick; or study how To humour and to please the Great-ones now: And if they can in that adventure speed, They'l be more painfull. Yes; 'tis like indeed, If in their climing they so high can wex, To gain the title of a Pontifex, 'Tis very like (perhaps) that we shall heare, They use the pulpit once or twice a yeare. Nay, it is well if it be done so oft. For this Ambition beares men so aloft, They from performance of their duties slide. But of all others this same Clergie-pride I hold not onely to be odious To God and men, but most pernicious To Prince, to Church, and to the Common-good. Witnesse the Beast of Rome, and his foule brood Of climing Cardinals; who from base states Are gotten to be Kings and Princes mates; Yea, their Superiors too; and all by this, A painted show of Humble holinesse. Even this is it of which the divell makes That cruell engine wherewithall he shakes Religions soundnesse: and rends in it chinks, Which he dawbes up againe, with what he thinks Shall ruine all in time. And is't not hence He had his meanes to marre the innocence Of Romes first Bishops? godlinesse grew strong; And flourisht while it was supprest with wrong. But when the worthy Emperours embrac'd The Sacred truth, and with their favours grac'd Their good proceedings, they soone gan to leave Their humble nature off, and closely weave Vnto religious shewes (not a bare Miter, It fits not the successors of Saint Peter) A triple Diadem and such a state, As never any earthly Potentate Enjoi'd a greater (all with humble Preaching) A long degree I tak't, beyond the reaching Of temporall Ambition, Heav'n I pray, Ere the first beast his time be done away, There rise not up another Monster here 'Mongst our ambitious Churchmen I should feare A second Antichrist, but that I hope They either shall be kept within their scope; Or the last judgement whose nigh time unknowne Shall cut him off ere he be wholy growne. Thus much some reason makes me bold to speake, And there is no mans sight I thinke so weake, But sees the same. Which though (I know full well) Twould better others fit than me to tell; Sith all neglect it, I have thus begun To Satyrize and o'er their follies run. Yet by my former words let none suppose, That I th' opinion do maintaine of those That doe our Bishops disallow, Let them that can; for sure I know not how. Nor would I have the world to understand That I tax all the Clergey in the Land, Or the whole Hierarchy: Thinke not so; For why? this presently Age doth yeeld I know Men that are truely worthy: and so many, That I beleeve few times (since Christ) had any More knowing or more painefull than some few. And whatsoe'er men thinke, yet here to shew, Though I Satyrically carpe at those That follow Vice and are true Vertues foes; I have not such a spitefull cankerd spirit, As to conceale or smother Worth and Merit. For I'l in Canturburies praise be bold This on my owne experience to uphold, The Sea was never governed as yet, By any one more rev'rend or more fit. For over and above his Country cares, Wherein he neither time nor counsell spares; Besides Church-businesse, whereto he applies His minde to further it, what in him lies, Besides all this his publike care at large, Few Ministers have in their private charge Tooke greater paine. That now the truth I tell, London and Lambeth both can witnesse well. And thou unhappy wert O London, then, When thou didst lose this rare one amongst men: Yet thou wert blest againe thy fate did bring In place of such a Father, such a King; So vigilent a watch-man in his place, That were it not my purpose here to trace The worlds mad humors, I from these had matter To make a Panegyrick of a Satyr. Yet is my Muse so constant in her frowne, Shee shall not sooth a King for halfe his Crowne Nor would slie thus much here have sung their praise Had she not thought them to be what she saies. But peradventure some will now condemne This my particular commending them. As if my setting of their vertues forth, Would be detraction from anothers worth. Which cannot be. For as this addes no more Vnto that reall worth these had before: So neither can I lessen, blot nor smother The good that is apparant in another. Nor doe I wish it should for might I here Stand to make bead-rols of who worthy were, I could adde divers that may claime this day As much to be extold by me, as they. Here I could name some other of their place That cannot basely fawne to winne them grace: Nor pick a Thank by seeking to condemne Those that are not in place to answer them. I know there's some who seeke the Churches good, And never at their Princes elbow stood With their lowd whisperings to stop his eare, Lest he should what did more concerne him here. I know there's such, and they will praised be, Though never knowne, not mentioned by m. But let this passe; whilst I so busie am About the Clergie, some are much to blame. The Court is factious growne through the desire Tha every one hath gotten to aspire. None doe esteeme their owne, but by compare: All would be somewhat more than others are. Yet he that's greatst, 'mong those that greatest seeme Is only great in other mens esteeme. And therefore sure hee's vaine who for such winde Can feed a restlesse humour in his minde, That's so unprofitable as at best It makes him onely in appearance blest. But when I weigh it, then I wonder much; Mans love unto this Passion should be such, As without understanding to let lie A reall good for an uncertainty. Those I have seene that have had riches store, Great Offices, and favours no men more; Honour and credit, yea and wisdome too: But (loe what an ambitious head will doe) Climing too hie, they got so low a fall, They forfeited their honours lives and all. Me thinks ere they in such an act should stur, 'Twere not amisse to thinke on Ãsops Cur, Who catching but to get a shaddow more, Did lose the substance which he had before. I might a while upon examples stand Of former times; but that within this Land, The present Age which I will onely view, Can yeeld enough to prove my sayings true And here, of many in this Kingdome showne, I at this present will remember one; And that shall be the late Ambitious plot, The like whereof the world sure yeeldeth not; I meane the Powder-treason, an Invention, Brought (had not God assisted) past prevention. And yet, ere they could clime to their desire, Ev'n when they were to mount but one step higher. (Let God be honour'd for't) downe tumbled all, And gave these Monsters a deserved fall. Which blest deliverance, if no happier song Tune in our too-forgetfull eares ere long (If heaven assist my purpose and the Times Be but auspicious to my homely Rimes) I meane to sing thereof, that after daies, Seeing Gods love to us, may tell his praise; And in such colours paint that hellish plot, It shall not for some Ages be forgot: But unto men unborne a Treason show More vile than ever any Age did know. And let them see that Ruine and Perdition Are the last periods to conclude Ambition, But to that purpose I may labour spend, And peradventure all to little end: Men will not thinke thereon, but still we see So lofty minded in their actions be, And with such thirst of titles have they sought them, As at deere rates they many times have bought them. Some have ambitious heads, but cannot rise, Because the want of meanes and friends denies What they aspire unto: whereat they vex, And their unquiet soules oft times perplex Beyond all reason. Oh strange humor'd men! Leave off this folly and grow wise agen. Be with your states content: for who doth know If his desire be for his good or no? Yea sure, one thinks; if I could but attaine Such offices; or so much wealth to gaine As this or that man hath, my wish were ended And such or such a fault should be amended. With that thou hast not yet how dost thou know Whether thou canst be well content or no? I tell thee this, though thou maist thinke it strange, With the estate tht minde doth also change: And when in one thing thou hast thy desire, Thou wilt not stay there but mount som what higher And higher still, untill thou dost attaine Vnto the top, or tumble downe againe. Be wary then you that ambitious are, And to restraine this madnesse have a care: Else at the last 'twill certainely deceive you: But you must have your wils, to which I leave you. Of Feare. Satyre 10. See you this Passion here that followes next, That shakes and lookes as with a fever vext? This is the pale and trembling caitife, Feare, Whose dastard humors I will make appeare. Note him and know him; This is he that mars All our delights on earth: 'tis he that bars Man the right use of pleasure, and 'tis hee That was at first ordain'd our plague to be. Come not too neare him, you that look for rest, Lest he insinuate into your brest: For entred once, it doth the body num, Makes it distemper'd or deform'd become, And sometime with illusions grim and foule, Doth startle and affright the very soule: The cause of it (if I may trust my skill) Is but a false opinion of some ill, That's present or to come. It inly stings; And for companions ever with it brings Both Paine and Shame: And diverse have I seen That with this Passion much abus'd have been. Some men there are, whose feare so foolish proves It many unto game and laughter moves. One came in lately almost out of breath; As if he hardly had escaped death, What was his feare? Alas, I tell you hee Tooke a white poast some walking sprite to be; Which strong surmise doth such impression take, That though he since hath seen 'twas but a stake, If on occasion, he be there be-nighted, Hee's yet with presence of the place affrighted. Another once I knew halfe staring mad, And he had seene the Divell, that he had, In an old house, sit cowring on a block, When all at last prov'd but a Turky-cock. Thus men oft feare when cause of feare is none, Making themselves a jest for every one; Yea, feare hath made a number so affraid, That they have oft their dearest friends betraid: For which cause onely I doe nere intend To chose a coward to become my friend. And if that women will advised be, To make in this a Counsellor of me, Let them admit no Coward in their love, Left their conclusions doe as hopelesse prove, As that poore Lasses unto whom befell This sad adventure which I meane to tell. Not farre from hence there dwelt not long agoe, As blithe a Girle as any one I know, A Gentlewoman of so good a ranke, Her favour seem'd t'have well deserved thanke. And cause in face and dowry few did match her, Many a Gallant tride his wit to catch her; While being kept but narrowly at home, She car'd not so she might be gone, with whom. And so, blind Fortune (that will seldome part Her favours unto men of more desert) Brings to the house a fellow that in show Seem'd worthy of the prize, but was not so. Yet having opportunity he tries, Gets her good will, and with his purchase flies. But ere 'twas long, the parents mist their daughter, Rais'd all the towne and following closely after, Were by meere chance unto an old house led, Where this young couple were new gone to bed. You that have ever in such taking bin, Iudge what a case these naked folkes were in. But what was done? The gallant left his prey, And like a fearefull Coward slunke away. Out on such asses, how could he for shame So leave a woman to beare all the blame? And for the griefe she suffers with her friends, How can the villaine make the whore amends? I know not: but for playing such a part, 'Tis certaine he hath lost the wenches heart: And she for climing to a cowards bed, Hath lost her credit with her Maiden-head. Here's one effect of feare. And yet from hence Springs also Cruelty, Impatience, Breach of our promises, with much Envying; That hurtfull and abhorred vice of Lying, Murthers and Treasons: nay, there's nought so base, So full of villanie, shame or disgrace, The fearefull would not act withall his heart, To free himselfe from feare of death or smart. Yea, some would be contented very well So they might scape death, to goe quick to hell. Such is the nature of it that I've seen Feare cause those evils that had else not been. To some it sicknesse brings and some beside E'en with the very feare of death have di'd: And many of them have so carefull bin To rid themselves from feares that they were in; That as the Ship which doth Charybdis shun, They ranne on Scylla, and were quite undone. The reason is they so amazed be With apprehending dangers which they see Pursuing of them, as they thinke not on The other mischiefes they may runne upon. And evermore it is the Cowards error To thinke the present danger ful'st of terrour. The feare of evill more tormenteth some, Than doth the thing they fear'd when once 'tis come Men dread what is, what will be, and (alas!) Many a thing that nere shall come to passe: For if they only fear'd apparant things (That likely-hood of some affrighting brings) As troops of enemies, or theeves, or treason, Pirats or stormes at sea, there were some reason, Or colour for it then, but they will quake At fictions: at meere nothings, their hearts ake At their owne fancies superstitions, At tales of Fairies or of Visions: Yea, I have seene one melancholly sad Vpon some foolish dreame that he hath had. Oh what meanes man that having mischifes store, Must in his owne conceit needs make them more? Thinks he those will not grim enough appeare, Vnlesse he apprehend them first by feare? Sure 'tis a plague the Divell did invent, To worke in man a lasting discontent, And taught it Adam; whereupon he said, I saw my nakednesse and was affraid. It is our weaknesse: yet I cannot see A reason why we should so fearefull be. May we not joy and be as merry still With hope of good, as sad with feare of ill? Sure I thinke yes; and will on hope so feed, No ill shall feare me till tis come indeed: For that which seemeth likeliest to betide me, God in his mercy yet may put beside me. And though much proofe had bred within my brest That resolution yet, of all the rest This last confirm'd it most: for the other day, When the hard frost had stopt the Scullers way, And left faire Thames with Ice so strongly archt That on the melting pavement people march'd: Amongst the rest one bolder than was fit, All heedelesse of his way fell out of it, Vpon a peece of Ice, which with a cracke, Rent from the maine, and stopt his going backe: This Icie fragment from the rest did swim, And to the Bridge a prisoner carried him, Where the spectators signes of pitty gave, And had a will but not a power to save. Which in his Passion then conceiving well Downe on his knees in that poore Arke he fell, And lifting up his hands did him implore That sav'd old Ionas without Saile or Oare. And see Gods mercy: when he drew so neare, No hope of safeguard seemed to appeare; When he had there just three times whirled bin, And that the Arch was like to suck him in. Then quite beyond all hope, e'en in a trice, There thrust-betweene a greater peece of Ice, Which comming downe as if it scorn'd to stay, Beat by the lesser peece to give it way. A while that staid: yet he had beene faine, When that was gone to take his turne againe, But that, next God the people stood his friend, And sav'd him by a rope, that's some mans end. Whereby I gather, we may sometime now Escape a mischiefe though we see not how. And in my minde this argument is cleare, That we have as much cause to hope, as feare. More trembling humors I might here unfold, Which some will be unwilling should be told And therefore passe them But I doe protest This hurtfull Monster I so much detest, That I am much unwilling to omit The least occasion of disgracing it. Yet doe I not allow their resolution, Who meerely of a hellish constitution, Have hearts obdurate, and so hard in evill, They neither seeme affraid of God nor Devill. Such I have noted too, but truly they Are in as bad though in another way. They prate and sweare as if they could affright, Or make Hobgoblin run away by night; When questionlesse as bold as they appeare, They are perplexed with an inward feare: Yea, I have knowne a trifle or a blast, Hath made such Champions oftentimes agast. There is an honest Feare that hinders sin, Which hath of all good men allowed beene: And there's a feare that keepes a Kingdomes state From ruine if it be not tane too late. It is not Servile feare that slavish crime; But rather 'tis a providence betime, That makes men very heedfull to fore-thinke Danger to come and not (as we doe) winke At our owne nakednesse; as without care Who spide it; so our selves we see not bare. This Feare it is that makes men to provide Against a storme, they may the better bide The fury of it: this tis keepes off wrong. And makes a Citie or a Kingdome strong. And I much doubt, the wanting of these feares Will make us smart for't yet ere many yeares. For since we are become a pretty number Although we can but one another cumber, Or serve to make a Hubbub; we suppose There are no Nations dare to be our foes. We thinke a wonderous policy we shew, If once in foure yeares we doe take a view Or count the number of our able men. Flattering our selves therewith; as if that then (Having so great and huge a multitude, Though we were ne'er so inexpert and rude) There were no cause of feare. But a Realmes might Consists not in the number that must fight; As in their skill, and of good Souldiers ten Will foile an hundred unexperienc'd men, Such as are we. For 'tis a shame to speake How wonderfull unfitly, and how weake This ignorance makes most of us; except Whom brave South-hamptons government hath kept In warlike order; I doe meane indeed Our Hampshire Ilanders; of whom for need A hundred Boies that ne'er had haire on chin, Shall from five hundred of up-landish, win Both field and Towne. Whereby it may appeare, Good government, with profitable feare, Within a few short yeares so well will thrive, One shall become to have the ods of five. Those therefore that are wise enough to tell When they do any thing amisse, or well, Still in this Passion doe observe a meane, And not to Feare, or to Presumption leane. Of Despaire. Satyre 11. No more of Feare, for lo, his impious brat Looks now to be admitted. This is that We call Despaire: with gastly look he stands, And Poysons, ropes, or poniards fill his hands, Still ready to do hurt: one step (no more) Reaches from hence unto damnations dore. This is that Passion giveth man instruction To wrest the Scripture to his own destruction: And makes him think, while he on earth doth dwell, He feels the tortures and the plagues of hell. It makes men rave like Furies, scritch and howle, With exclamations horrible and foule More Monster like than men. Onely damnation Is in their mouthes; no mercy, no salvation, Can they have hope of, but possesse a feare, Whence monstrous shapes and visions do appeare To their imaginations: and the pain That they in soule and conscience do sustain, All earthly tortures doth so much exceed, As if they had within them hell indeed. This is that last-worst instrument of Feare, Which our Grand-foe (and hells great Enginere) Raiseth against the fortresse of the heart: But many times God frustrates quite his art. For when he doth assaile the same (with trust He from their fortresse faith and hope shall thrust) It makes them unto Christ their Captain flie, Leave to be too secure and fortifie. God also makes this Passion now and then His scourge to lash the proud presumptuous man, And tame the Reprobate, who by this rod Is made sometimes to feel there is a God. By this strange wonders brought to passe I've seen, Those humbled that have once the proudest been: Yea, some I've known whose hearts have been so hard They with no feare of judgment could be scar'd; Yet after this hath seiz'd them, it hath made These daring spirits tremble at their shade. Shake at meere apparitions; nay, at nought But what hath being onely in their thought. And in respect of what they were, no change That ever I observed seems so strange. Those friends and pleasures that once seem'd most deare, Most odious to them in such fits appeare: And greatest comfort they do finde in them, Whose waies and persons they did most condemne. Oh, what repentant lives some vow to live, If God would but once more vouchsafe to give Them health &amp; hope again! then they would spend Their lives and goods unto no other end Save wholly for his glory: yet there's now Some living that have quite forgot that vow, God give them grace to look into their errour, Or they will one day feele a double terrour. But many in this agony hath nought More than the way unto their ruine sought; And still our busie enemie the Devill, Author and chiefe procurer of this evill (Vnlesse Gods mercie his black plots prevents) Is ready to provide him Instruments, But I ev'n quake to think what humours be Attending on this hellish maladie. Which I had rather labour to eschew, Than to be overcurious here to shew. Now, some do think this Passion being taken, Can very hardly be again forsaken: For (far above all mischiefs raging) This The cursed traytor to our safety is; And will not means permit us to apply Ought that may bring us ease or remedy. But there are courses to prevent this sinne: And (though it be insinuated in) God that doth ever pitty our distresse, Will not forsake us in our heavinesse. Nor can we say that he hath left us voide Of help, for ought wherewith we are annoyd Through Sathans guile. He pittieth our case, And daily makes us offers of his grace, If wee'll lay hold on't. For, how truely deare We to the Father of all mercie are, He shew'd in giving for a Sacrifice His sonne, to pay for our iniquities. In whom (if unbeleeving make not blinde) For every griefe of body and of minde, There is a Salve. And every Christian knows (Or should at least) a Sacred Spring, whence flows A precious liquor; whose rare vertue can Cure ev'ry griefe of minde that tortures Man. But we must be advis'd how to apply This med'cine rightly to our malady: For some that have presumed on their skill, Out of things good, have drawn effects as ill, And so the Sacred-Truth is now and then So wrested by the false conceits of men; As thence they gather means to sooth their Passion, And make more obstinate their Desperation: Which from your soules pray heaven to keep as farre, As is earths center from the highest starre. But there's a two-fold Desperation reignes; One sort is that which a distrust constrains In things that do concern the soules salvation: The horriblest and feareful'st Desperation. But th' other is alone of earthly things, And nothing so much disadvantage brings; Yet like enough in little time to grow Vertues main let, or utter overthrow. For where it entrance gets, it makes men loth To undertake great matters, cause through sloth They do despaire to reach them. Yea, it breeds A carelesnesse in man, and thence proceeds Not a few Treasons; for one breach of Law Brings many times offenders in such awe, That in despaire of pardon for their ill, They not alone hold out their errour still; But being guilty of one crime before, To scape the lash for that, adde twenty more: And cause at first they thought themselves undone, At last to desperate Rebellion runne. Besides, there's some despairing of their cause, Who being brought to triall by the lawes For their offence are obstinately mute: And unto these (forsooth) some do impute A manly resolution; 'cause thereby They carefull seem of their posterity. But sure there is no wiseman will commend Him that so desperately seekes his end, Or thorow wilfulnesse undoes himselfe, (Body and soul perhaps) to save his pelfe To some Survivours; whereas if he bide On hope, and stand contented to be tri'd According to the Laws, he may be clear'd, And quitted of the danger he so fear'd, As some have been. Besides, When we endure Any small pain, if we despaire of cure, Ease, or amends, 'twill make it seem to be Almost unsufferable. But if we Have any hope, the rest we look to win, Will mitigate the torture we are in. His winter-toyle what Plough-man could sustain If he despaired of his harvest-gain? And the strong'st army needs must faint and flie, If it distrust before of victorie. But to conclude this; be it understood, Despair's a thing that doth so little good, As to this day I cannot yet observe That purpose whereto man might make it serve, Vnlesse to help a troop of Cowards fight: For, could a man lead them past hope of flight, Where they should see there were no remedie But they must die, or get the victorie; Despaire in that case might give them the day, Who would have lost it to have run away. Of Hope. Satyre 12. Thrice welcome Hope; the Devill keep home the tother. Despaire and Feare are fitting for no other. This is the Passion that of all the rest We have most reason to esteem of best. For if it be with good advice applide, A salve it is God did himselfe provide To ease not onely every outward griefe; But when the Soul wants comfort or releefe It will redresse her pain; although it were The shaking off that hideous Monster, Feare. This is a Balme so precious, had we power To take it to our selves at such an houre When black Despaire doth pinch us; this indeed Would so expell it, as we should not need The drugges of Rome: But what (alas!) can wee Rightly apply, and not instructed be? Vnlesse some power assist us, it is true Our nature so unapt is to pursue The way it should, that we do follow still The crooked'st paths and lose our selves in i'l. Hope is a blessing but we so abuse it, As to our hurt more than our good we use it. Yea this, that was of all the Passions best, We have as much corrupted as the rest; Ev'n that, on which our chiefest good depends, And to our highest of contentment tends. For we must note well that this Passion's double, One Hope is certain, th' other full of trouble, And most uncertain. Now the first attends Things meere immortall, and alone depends On th' expectation of the certain'st things, With that perfection of true joy, which brings No trouble with it. This, through Faith we gain; And 'tis sufficient to make any pain Seem short and easie. 'Tis the life of man, And such a comfort as no mortall can Live if he want it. And yet sometime this Each way as idle as the other is. For oftentimes we see the same is found To be erected on no other ground But ignorance, or meere securitie. Which ruine all who do on them relie. Some praise their own deserts, and on that sand Would fain have the divinest hope to stand. Which no contentment doubtlesse can assure, Nor without wav'ring to the end endure. And if it do not, to small end will be That idle trust and confidence which we Can have elsewhere; since every other kinde Of Hope, which I amongst us men do finde, Is of uncertain earthly things; and such As neither long endure, nor please us much. Then the best likelihoods that may be shown, And the strong'st humane reasons that are known, Are nothing worth to ground a hope upon, But in the turning of a hand, all's gone. Were all the men on earth procured to Some thing that lay in one mans power to doe. And all were well resolv'd to see it done: (Yea wer't but one daies work, and that begun) Well might we hope that they would bring to passe So small a thing as that; but yet (alas!) None can assure so much, because none know A warrant from above it shall be so. And therefore though I wish that every man Should take upon him the best hope he can In all his outward actions, yet should he Take care on honest grounds it builded be. And therewith be so wel-prepared still, That if his doubtfull hope do fall out ill, He ne'er repine, but tak't as if the same Had been expected long before it came. And sith that fickle-trust did nought availe him, Depend on the true-hope shall never faile him. For what is plac'd on humane wit or strength, Is vain, and most uncertain; 'cause at length How-e'er it may seem sure, it may deceive him, And when he hath most need of comfort leave him. This Hope is now become the Patronesse, And chiefe maintainer of mans wickednesse: Ther's not a villany man doth intend, Vnlesse that he have this to be his friend. Hope egges him on, and with a thousand wiles His much abused confidence beguiles. Hope tells the theefe, if he will rob, he may Have twenty means to hide himselfe away. Hope doth entise the Prodigall to spend, And will not let him thinke upon his end; But doth perswade him, some good boty shall Hap at the last to make amends for all. And never ceaseth thus to beare him faire, Till she undoes, and leaves him to despaire. Shee soothes the Gamester in his trifles vaine; And draws the Pirate on with hope of gaine. She makes the Courtier into treason run; Our Great-mens Followers serve till they're undone, And for the present (having nought to give) Vpon reversions all her servants live. Now every man unto this hope is led By sundry other Passions in him bred, As Love, Ambition, Avarice, or such: And true it is, in these our hope is much. But oftentimes we into errours run So blindely on that we are quite undone, Because indeed we hopefully expect Many such things as we can ne'er effect; And give to our desires a larger scope Than will admit of any likely hope. So we our selves abuse, and are disgrac'd Oft-times with that, which wer't with reason plac'd Vpon an honest and a certain ground, Would seldome be so vainly frustrate found. But Lovers hopes, and such as are so bold On every paultry trifle to lay hold, Neither last long, nor for the time indeed Can they one jot of true contentment breed. Ambitious men, what e'er they do intend, Have still new hopes to bring their plots to end. But they are all so built on such weak props, That e'er they be possessed of their hopes, All overthrown we in a moment spie, And they with their inventions ruin'd lie. Into which mischiefe he yet never fell That knew but how to use this Passion well. Of Compassion. Satyre 13. Bvt as the former Passion was abus'd, So this that follows is but hardly us'd. Yet it is known a kinde and tender Passion, In it own nature worthy commendation: And if discretion guide it, well may be Of neere alliance unto Charitie. If not; it with the rest from vertue swerves, And so with them alike reproofe deserves. Which some will wonder at; such as suppose A man through pitty cannot erre: yet those, If they have any judgment of their own, Shall say, Compassion may amisse be shown. Or if you put no confidence in me, Come to our Courts of Iustice, and there see How shee's abus'd: there mark and you shall finde, It makes the Iuror many times so blinde, They see, but stumbling by do tread, Beside the way their Evidences lead There you may spie the reverend Iudge compeld Through an effeminate tendernesse, to yeeld Vnto this melting Passion: Sometime by A Personall respect tane by the eye; Sometime because th' offender (it may be) Already hath sustain'd much miserie. And this think they is Charitie aright; (Through ignorance indeed) forgetting quite, Whil'st they an ill deserved life prolong, Therein they do not onely justice wrong; But by their indiscreet and fond Compassion, Vnwisely hazard e'en their own discretion. Some through this pitty (when they much implore) Though they unjustly favour him that's poore, Deeme they do not amisse, and why? they trust, (Because their meaning's good, their doing's just. Some there are also, who would fain be deem'd Wise men, that have through weaknesse mis-esteem'd Those orders which for wandring rogues are made, As though that begging were a lawfull trade; They pitty those that justly punish'd be: And often erring in their Charitie, They boldly have accus'd the laws therefore, As if their rigour injured the poore. But he I feare whose judgment is so slender, Or hath a yeelding heart so fondly tender To stoop unto this Passion; neither spares The lawes of God nor man; but oft times dares Pervert them both; supposing his intent Shall free him from deserved punishment. And though that God himselfe saies Kill, reply With, No, alas, 'tis pitty he should die. And for their weaknesse merit equall check With him that spar'd the King of Amaleck, For verily, as vertuous as it shows, A foolish pitty quickly overthrows In warre an Army, and in peace a State: And this I'le stand to, 'Tis as bad as Hate: For that and bribes to such a power is grown, Iustice and conscience are quite overthrown. Certain it is (and cannot be withstood) That Pitty sometimes hurts the Common-good. Yea, God himselfe it many waies offends, And therefore that man who indeed intends To beare himselfe uprightly, ought to see How far this Passion may admitted be. For seem how 'twill, all pitty is unfit, Vnlesse Gods laws and mans do warrant it. But I have seen a tender-hearted Asse That's worth the laughing at, and doth surpasse For foolish pitty (but he, he alone Is hurtfull to himselfe, or else to none) To such as he read but some Tragedie; Or any peece of mournfull historie; And if the matter which you do relate Be sorrowfull or something passionate, Though it were done a thousand yeares ago, And in a Countrey he did never know, Yet will he weep (kinde-heart) as if those men Were of his friends, and the mischance but then Before their eies in action: nay, unfold Some new made tale that never yet was told, So it be dolefull, and do represent A strange and lamentable accident: Although not onely (as I said before) It be a matter meerly fein'd, but more, Although he know it so, he cannot keep His melting eyes from teares but he must weep Which is a weaknesse whence more mischiefs grows Than any at first thinking would suppose. I might touch Parents also in the City That marre their children by their cockring pitty, If other Passions call'd me not away. And yet before I leave, thus much I'le say; Want of rebuke elsewhere, and rods in Schools, Hath almost fill'd the land with knaves and fools. Then you that think we need no pitty shun, Forsake the errour whereinto you run, With those Divines that admonitions spare, Or in reproving over-easie are; With many more of different degree, But unto these I'le not o're-bitter be. And you that are, or you that would at least Be counted men, and beare within your breast That vertue which befitting manhood is, Shun such base humours as fond Pitty is. For why should you be there-with over-born, When 'tis a Passion that now women scorn? Of Crueltie. Satyre 14. Bvt here's another beares us further wide, (If we embrace it) on the other side. And therefore whilst we seek how to beware Of foolish Pitty; we must have a care, But this do over-run us: 'tis a thing Whose very name doth seem enough to bring All men in their opinion to confesse, Tis an inhumane hellish wickednesse. A monstrous Passion, so unfit to rest, Or harbour in a reasonable brest, That beasts, in whom it rather should remain, Do, for the greatest part, the same refrain. And yet as odious as it doth appeare, Vnlesse men look to their affections neare, 'Twill steal upon them, and they shall begin Not onely to be quickly snar'd therein: But (though at first they do abhorre it much) The nature of this Passion still is such, It will become delightfuller, and make So deep impression in the heart, and take So sure a root, 'twill hardly be displac'd, Whilst that the body by the soule is grac'd. Though many doe suppose it may with ease Be left or taken as each man shall please: Such men are wide; and they are over-bold And too much trusting to themselves that hold We need not this same Passion discommend; Since nature of her selfe doth reprehend So vile a fault. For thus, say they, Our Reason never can so much decay To make us our humanity defile With any Passion that is known so vile. Indeed, it is a monstrous villany, And most, I think, can rail at Cruelty: Yet let none be secure for this is true, Those odious vices we do most eschew, Grow pleasing by degrees. When Hazael Was told what he should do to Israel, Full little thought he then his gentle heart Should ever give consent to act a part Of such a Tragick Scene; and yet we finde He be came after of another minde, For mans intents and best affections be Exceeding subject to uncertainty What least we think to doe (unlesse each hower We have remembrances) such state is our, We often minde not. For which cause the Sire Of that bold Grecian King, who did aspire To be the worlds third Monarch; knowing well Himselfe to be a man, mistrusted still To what he might through humane frailty fall, And therefore still appointed one to call Thus at his window (e'er the day began) Philip, Remember that thou art a man. And sure as hatefull as this Passion is, To have some caveat is not much amisse. For though no such things in our selves we spie, In secret oftentimes 'twill lurking lie. And when it breakes forth into any act, With colour of some vertue hides the fact, As justice, or the like: and then it will So harden by degrees the heart in ill, As that we shall not think we do amisse, When as our Cruelty extreamest is. He deemes himselfe no such that without shame Doth rob another of his honest name By raising false reports; nor that hard lord, Who to his tenant grudges to afford What law and conscience gives: nor he that takes The common profit to himselfe, and makes His own good of it, when he knows thereby Many a poore man's brought to beggery. These think with cruelty they do not deal, What wrongs soe'er they do the Common-weal, This vice so hardens them. The damn'd Vsurers, And cut-throat Brokers, Mammons Treasurers (Who by the small use they of riches make, Do for another seem their care to take) Though not content with Statute-vsury, A thousand other polling tricks they trie; Increasing their lewd gains by bribes and gifts, And many viler or more lawlesse shifts: Though they do make no conscience what they doe So they may act it, and scape justice too, Pinching poore Debtors, till their greedy hands Have got possession both of goods and lands, Would not be cruell thought, although that this Be as true Cruelty as any is. And what are Lawyers that can brook to see Christians like beasts that still at variance be; And when it lieth in their power to part them, Do, for their own gain, unto discord hart them? Or nourish still the strife by adding fuell To discords flame? Trust me, I think them cruell: What-e're they deem themselves: and not alone The mercilesse offender; but each one, Who when he doth perceive that there is need, Is slack to do a charitable deed. What may be thought of them whose chiefest care Is pampering the flesh with curious fare; Largely providing for the bodies good, Whilst the poore soule is hunger-starv'd for food? Are not they cruell? Is it like that such Who can neglect their dearest souls so much, Are mercifull to others? You well say Murder is cruelty. Then what are they That by false doctrine, fraught with errours foule, Do murder, or do worse than kill the soule? Them to be guilty none can will deny. But you will say, 'Tis not that Cruelty You understood: As if you did suppose None through this Passion did offend but those That seek for bloud. Indeed, that is the worst, And of all cruelty the most accurst; Which for no other purpos'd end is us'd, But a meere longing to see things abus'd. Then 'tis at highest when men use to see Or act some deed that's full of Crueltie; Onely for that 'tis so; or 'cause their will Findes devillish contentments in their ill. Such was his humour, who (out of desire To see how Troy burnt when it was on fire) Caus'd Rome in many a place at once to flame; And longing to behold from whence he came, Ript up his mothers wombe. So in the height Was also his that took so much delight In seeing men extreamly tortured, That he out of his bounty promised A large reward to him that could invent The cruell'st and unusuall'st punishment. Which Phalaris demanding, was therefore The first that made his brazen Bull to roare. Such is theirs also whose unmanly natures Can be the needlesse death of any creatures, Or torture, or behold them pleasingly, Whilst they abused and tormented die. Trust me; bee't but a dog, nature denies,, And God forbids that we should tyrannize. Much more on man: yet there is many a one That to this hellish Passion is so prone, With boasts he glories in his mischiefes too, And uncompell'd would make no more adoe To murder till a Countrey were unman'd, Than doth a School-boy with a walking wand To lop down Thistles. But all such men be Extreamly cruell in the high'st degree. And though the first rehearsed be not so, Yet thereto they may very quickly grow; (Vnlesse they have oft warning to beware) Sith they already halfe-way entred are. Especially the greedy hungry Elfe, That would for profit gladly damne himselfe. For Avarice doth harden so the heart, In any mischiefe he may beare a part: No cruelty the Covetous refrains, Murther nor Treason so he may have gains. More I could say against this Passion yet: But would men of themselves well ponder it, A little meditation of their own Might profit more than all that I have shown. And therefore I will here conclude with this, As he is blessed that meek-hearted is: So on the Cruell lightly doth attend, A heavy curse, and a most fearfull end. Of Ioy. Satyre 15. Of all the Passions handled hitherto, With this that follows I had least to doe. By some small trials though that I have had, I finde 'tis better far than being sad: And that no greater good on earth might be, If it would last, and were from combrance free. But that can never be, our state is such; And Destiny moreover seems to grutch Ought should be perfect in mortality, Lest we should leave to seek Eternitie. Never could any yet that Ioy obtain On which there follow'd neither shame nor pain: For he (no question) that's allowed most, Doth dearely pay for what is quickly lost. But sure the reason why mans joy so soon Is chang'd to sorrow, is because there's none, Or very few, that do their gladnesse found Vpon a solide, firme, substantiall ground: But on such subjects, as no marvell though, It doth receive so quick an overthrow, And brings so sharp a farewell. For one joyes In Dogs, Apes, Monkies, or some such like toies; And when they faile, (as how can they last long?) Their mirth is finish'd, they must change their song. Some in their honour all their joy do place; And then if but a frown or some disgrace Adde the least motion unto Fortunes wheele, Sorrow takes place, and little joy they feele. Take but away his substance, you destroy The miserable Richmans onely joy. And soon by sicknesse that delight's defac'd, Which man in beauty, or in strength hath plac'd. Yea, the best joy in transitory things, They being lost, at last a sorrow brings. All men should therefore make a carefull choice Of that wherein their meaning's to rejoyce, And not affect things so extreamly vain, As make them to repent their joy again. Yet many do so settle their delight On things unworthy, that they are e'en quite Bereft of understanding when they see They must of them again deprived be. One foole hath lost his Hawk to day, and he Can neither eate, nor drink, nor merry be: There was his onely joy, and now 'tis gone, Without all doubt the Gentleman's undone. Young Mistresse Vanity is also sad Because the Parrat's dead she lately had. Alas! and blame her not if that she houle, The Parrat was (I warrant) halfe her soule. But weigh this you that have your better parts Of an immortall fame, awake your hearts, And from delight in drosse and clay remove Your joyes, to place them on the things above: So shall you still have reason to rejoyce, And not with sorrow thus repent your choyce. This that you so much doat on is a toy So far from meriting the name of Ioy, That either 'tis not thorowly obtained; Or if it be in such a measure gained As you would wish it, then you are no lesse Endanger'd by an over-joyfulnesse. For had you seen men that were calm'd at Sea, And forc'd the leasure of the windes to stay, Halfe starv'd for food, brought to some happy shore, Where is of victualling with all things store, And there through hunger greedily begin To glut their stomacks that have fasting bin, With the long-wish'd-for cates; Lo, while they eate, They grow extreamly faint with wholsome meat: And thorow weaknesse by disuse of food, That which was for their comfort and their good Turnes to their bane. Right so it fares in this; For he that long time in some sorrow is, And tost upon the boistrous seas of care, If for his comfort he be landed there Where joy abounds; his heart (where none hath bin Full many a day before) receives it in So out of measure, that it even makes The soule unquiet; and thereby he takes A surfeit: whose strong violence is such, The body faints, or is endanger'd much. Some of mine own acquaintance I have seen That with this Passion have o'er-charged been And at relating of some news that's good, Have almost senselesse and amazed stood: Yea, been so ravish'd with the joy they took, That they have for a time their lives forsook. But neither can not will I e'er commend Such joy as this; for when we apprehend That we delight in with too deep content, God laies that on us for a punishment; To shew what danger and uncertainty Is in the best of earths felicity: And that no joy can sweet or lasting prove, Which from his speciall favour doth not move. Somewhat still follows every other joy, That doth with bitternesse the sweet destroy: And sure this may some reason of it be, Men in their mirth are carelesse to foresee What ill may follow, and (beyond all measure) Give way unto their false conceived pleasure. Which hurtfull liberty they must restrain, If they will any true contentment gain. And I am of this minde, If every man Would curb rebellious thoughts but what he can, Armes of resistance he might better weeld, And not so basely to this Passion yeeld. Neither befits it Man that ought to be At all times fenc'd with magnanimitie, To suffer any mischiefe to annoy His minde, through either too much care or joy: But so the one should of the other borrow. He might be sad with mirth, and glad with sorrow. Thus I advise; and here my pen shall stay; The reason is, I have no more to say: But when with joy I am acquainted better, I'le tell you more, or else remain you debter. Of Sorrow. Satyr. 16. Of this sad Passion I may knowledge take, And well say somewhat for acquaintance sake. 'Tis a disease that doth possesse so many, It neither doth forbeare nor favour any. Come when it will an ill report it gains, And every one of his hard usage plains. Then, tis beside so troublesome a guest: None that do harbour it have any rest: And which is worse, though he his host diseases, 'Tis thought he cannot rid him when he pleases. And yet methinks if man would use his might, He may asswage, if not out-weare it quite: It is at least his duty; for should he That must on earth th' Almighties Viceroy be? Should he to whom the Soveraigne Lord hath given A countenance that should behold the heaven? With Sorrows visage hide his manly grace, And groveling turn to earth his blubber'd face? Is't not a shame to see the man who saith, That he a Christian is, and seems t'have faith, Should for misfortune without remedie, Be passionate in such extremity, That childish teares not onely stain his face, (Which may be born withall in many a case) But also raves, grows furious; and extends His griefe past reasons limits? who commends A man for that? Say, is it any lesse, Than to deny by deed what words professe? For who would think which sees how he bewailes The losse of breath that in a moment fails That he beleeves, but rather thinks 'tis vain To hope or trust the flesh shall rise again? Or that there were, as holy Scripture saith, Any reward for them that die in faith. It's a plain token of a mis-beleefe, When Christians so o'er-whelm themselves in griefe: And therefore, though I do not discommend The moderate bewailing of a friend; I wish th' extream hereof men might despise, Lest their profession they do scandalize. Beside, (though as I seem'd to say before) Vnles't be common, 'tis no common sore, Because it hurts but those that entertain it, Yet good it were if all men could refrain it. For it not onely makes mans visage be Wried, deform'd and wrinkled as we see; Himselfe exiling from the common eye, To vex and grieve alone he knows not why: But also brings diseases with his death, By the untimely stopping of his breath. It makes his friends to loath his company, And greatly hinders his commodity. For who to deale in his affaires is fit, Vnlesse with good-will he attendeth it? And howsoe'er it seeme; yet surely this, As farre from vertue as bad pleasure is: For as through th' one we to much evill run, So many good things the other leaves undone. I wonder that this Passion should touch The hearts of men to make them grieve so much As many doe for present miseries? Have they no feeling of felicities That are to come? If that they be in paine, Let hope give ease; it will not alwaies raine. Calmes doe the roughest stormes that are attend, And the longst night that is, will have an end. But 'tis still bad thou saist: take't patiently, An Age is nothing to Eternity. Thy time's not here; envie not, though that some Seeme to thee happy; their bad day's to come: And if thou knewst the griefe they must sustaine, Thou would'st not thinke so hardly of thy paine. I must confesse, 'twas once a fault of mine At every misadventure to repine. I sought preferment and it fled me still, Whereat I griev'd, and thought my fortune ill. I vext to see some in prosperity, Deride and scoffe at my adversity. But since, advis'd and weighing in my minde The course of things I soone began to finde The vainenesse of them. Those I saw of late In blisse (as I thought) scorning my estate, I see now ebbing and the once full tide That overflow'd the lofty banks of pride, Hath left them like the sand-shore, bare and dry, And almost in as poore a case as I. Besides I view'd my daies now gone and past, And how my fortunes from the first to th' last Were link'd together: I observ'd, I say, Each chance and deed of mine, from day to day, That memorie could keepe; yet found I none, Not one thing in my life that was alone, But still it either did depend on some That was already passed or to come Yea the most childish, idle, trifling thing, That seemed no necessity to bring, In that, hath the beginnings oft bin hid, Of some the weightiest things that ere I did. But chiefly to abate th' excessive joying In worldly things, and to prevent th' annoying Of any sorrow, this I noted thence, (And eversince have made it a defence For both these Passions) I have truly seene; That those things wherewith I have joyed beene Highly delighted and the dearest lov'd; E'en those same very things have often prov'd My chiefest care. And I have found againe, That which I deem'd my greatest losse or paine, And wherewithall I have beene most annoi'd, And should have deem'd a blessing to avoid; That which my heart hath ask'd for: and wherein I thought me most unhappy, that hath bin The ground of my best joyes. For which cause, I Advise all men that are in miserie To stand unmov'd. For why, they doe not know Whether it be to them for good or no. They ought not for to murmure, or to pine At any thing, shall please the power divine To lay upon them, for my minde is this, Each sorrow is an entrance into blisse. And that the greatest pleasure we attaine, Is but a signe of some ensuing paine. But to be plainer; this our life's a toy, That hath nought in it worth our griefe or joy. But there are some base-minded dunghill Elves, That sorrow not for any but themselves. Or if they doe, tis onely for the losse Of some old crest-falne Iade: but that's a crosse Past bearing; be it but a rotten sheepe, Or two stale egges, they will such yelling keepe As if thereby had perished a brood In which consisteth halfe the kingdomes good. But I intreat them (since cares must befall) They would be patient; Who can doe withall? And also let them of much griefe beware: For they have heard what dangers therein, are. And every one almost can tell them, that 'Tis an old saying, Cars will kill a Cat. Then let them take heart: chiefly, sith they see None live but sometime they must losers be. Which is an ease: for I have heard them tell, With mates they care not if they goe to hell. But in good earnest now let us not run Willingly here into as we have done. Avoid it rather as a hurtfull foe, That can effect nought but our overthrow. And for the same receive into our brest An honest mirth, which is a better guest. And whatsoe'er our former griefe hath bin Let us ne'er sorrow more but for our sinne. So with this Passion end the rest will I, Because it ends not till our end is nigh. The Conclusion. Thus have I labour'd some effects to show, That doe from mens abused Passions flow: Which with examples of old ages past, And wisemens sayings I might more have grac'd. But that I am resolv'd to tie my Rimes As much as may be to the present Times. I also might amongst these here have told, The bodies passions, as Hunger, Cold, Heat, Thirst, and such like: but their force is seene, And most men have sufficient carefull beene How to prevent them. They last not so long, Nor are by much so violent and strong, Or dangerous as these. But if men knew, Or with the eie of Reason would o'er-view These soule-bred maladies (as sure they ought) They would with greater diligence have sought The cure of them, before the worst disease, That doth the body and no more displease. But now the reason men disturbed are For the most part with such preposterous Care, Is this; Through their corrupted judgement they Doe only on things seene depend and stay. Which being most apparant to the sense, So muffles up the weake intelligence, And blinds her that shee hath no power to see The better things that more subsisting be. When if they could conceive but halfe so well The soules estate they'd labour to expell All those corruptions that may cause her woe, And those fell Passions that molest her so. But some men have in this opinion stood, That every Passion's naturall and good. Indeed Philosophers the same doe call, A motion of the soule that's naturall. And in some sort, we may not be affraid To hold for truth as much as they have said. But we must make a difference of it then; And grant that two-fold Passions are in men: One sort unto the noblest things aspiring And such as what is meerely good desiring, Therein rejoyceth: moderate and weake In operation. And the truth to speake, We have it rather by Gods inspiration, Than bred within us at our generation. The other (as the effects thereof doe show) Doth by our owne corrupted nature grow; For, it is head-strong, rash, insatiate, Wonderous disordred and immoderate. Of which kinde these are, whereof I have spoken, And they are oft the cause mens sleepes are broken 'Tis that, which makes them rave or grieve, or joy So out of measure for a trifling toy. Yea, that tis onely makes them oft so teastie; Their friends seeme troublesome, their beds uneasie. And lastly these are the occasions still Of all misfortunes and of every ill. Th' effects they doe produce we also see. Contrary to our expectations be. For he that hopes or lookes for to attaine Great joy and pleasure, haps on griefe and paine. But by what meanes may men these Passions kill? Sure, not by the procuring of their will, As some imagine. For first it may be A thing that's not in possibility For them to reach unto. But say it were, Will the ambitious minded-man forbeare To be ambitious if he once fulfill His longing thoughts? No, he will rather still Increase that Passion which at first he had, Or fall into some other that's as bad. For altering the condition or estate, The soules vexation doth no more abate, Than changing roomes or beds doth ease his paines That hath a Fever: sith the cause remaines Still in himselfe. But how and which way then May these diseases be recur'd in men? Why, by Philosophy, Counsell and Reason: These being well appli'd in their due season, May doe much good. Else seeke the cause whence rise These hurtfull and pernitious maladies. Let them consider that, and so they may Cut off th' effect by taking it away. But if they cannot the occasions finde, Ile tell them, tis a basenesse of the minde; Or else a false opinion that's in some, Of good or evill present or to come. Respecting good things thus: They doe desire And are too vehemently set on fire With coveting what seemes so; or annoying Themselves with an excessiue Over-joying In the obtaining. In regard of ill, They are oppressed with some sorrow still. So that we see if men would goe about To change their minds and drive that basenesse out Through magnanimity (And note well this, That Passion but some false opinion is, Fram'd by the will and drawne by the direction Of judgement that's corrupted by affection) Me thinks they might by reasons helpe confound The former terrors that have tane such ground In their weake hearts and learne for to esteeme That which doth neither good nor evill seeme (And in their soules such perturbation wrought) As things nor good nor ill; and that which ought (Being unworthy) neither to molest, Nor breed no passions in their carefull brest. By these, and other such like meanes as these, The wise Philosophers in elder daies Kept out those furies. And 'twere now a shame If that we Christians could not doe the same; Having besides these helpes whereon they staid, A certaine promise of a better aide, If wee'l but aske it. Let's demand it then, To rid these evils from our soules agen. If that wee feele them yet not stirring in us, Let us preuent them ere by force they win us. For 'tis more easie (every one doth know) To keepe him out, than to expell a foe. If any thinke I from my purpose swerve, Cause my intent was chiefly to observe, And not to Teach: let them not blame me tho; For who can see his friends lie sick, and know Which way to cure them? But you'l say my skill Cannot instruct you: yet may my good will Be worth accepting: and that howsoever Is not to be rejected altogether. For, I have seene when in a knowne disease, Doctors withall their Art could give no ease To their weake patient; a poore Country dame Hath with a home-made med'cine cur'd the same: And why not I in this? Yes, Ile abide it; Being well us'd, it helpes for I have tride it. Thus much for that; but still there doe remaine Some other Observations to explaine: I have not done; for I am further taskt, And there's more humors yet to be unmaskt, Wherein because I will not step astray, Nor swerve from Truth a jot beside the way, I'l say no more (lest men should seeme belide) Than what my owne experience hath espide: And then, if any frowne (as sure they dare not) So I speake Truth let them frowne still I care not. But if my Muse you should so sawcy finde, Sometime to leave her notes and speake her minde As oft she will when she perchance doth see How vaine, or weake, or fickle most men be. Yet blame me not, 'tis out of much good will I beare to you and hatred unto ill. Which when I see my purpos'd course I breake, Because indeed, I am compell'd to speake. Yet thinke not, though I some-where bitter be, I count my selfe from all those vices free: Rather imagine 'tis to me well knowne, That here with others faults I tell mine owne. The end of the first Booke. THE SECOND BOOK Of the Vanity, Inconstancie, Weaknesse, and Presumption of Men. PRECATIO. Thou that createdst all things in a Weeke, Great God (whose favour I do only seek,) E'en thou by whose desired inspirations I undertooke to make these observations; Oh grant, I pray sith thou hast deign'd to show Thy servant that which thousands doe not know, That this my noting of mans hum'rous Passion, May worke within me some good alteration, And make me so for mine owne follies sorry, That I may lead a life unto thy glory. Let not ambition nor a foule desire, Nor hate, nor envy set my heart on fire: Revenge, nor Choler, no nor Iealousie; And keepe me from Despaire and Cruelty, Fond hope expell; and I beseech thee blesse My soule from Feare and too much Heavinesse. But give me speciall grace to shun the vice That is so common, beastly Avarice: And grant me power I not only know, But flye those evils that from passion flow, Moreover now inspire my soule with art, And grant me thy assistance to impart The rest of mens ill Customes yet remaining, And their vaine humors; that by my explaining, They may perceive how odious I can make them, Blush at the reading, and at last forsake them. Yea let my muse in this, and things to come, Sing to thy glory, Lord, or else be dumbe. Of Vanity. Satyr. 1. My Muse, that now hath done the best she can To blaze corrupted Passion bred in man, Goes further here, and meaneth to undoe Another knot of ils hee's prone unto. From which as out of the maine root there growes All whatsoever evill, Mankind knowes. With thousands of bad humors; of which some Such as to minde by observation come; As also such as are the proper crimes Of these ungodly and disorder'd times) She meanes to treat of. The chiefe heads be these, Consider of them Reader if thou please.) First, wanton and light-headed Vanity, Next that, Chamelion-like Inconstancy; Then, miserable Weakenesse; lastly this, Damned Presumption, that so daring is. But ere I doe begin this worke, that I May speake to purpose with sincerity, Lord, I beseeeh thee helpe me to explaine, And teach me to contemne the thing that's vaine. I have begun in thee this my endeavour, And constancy vouchsafe me to persever: My knowledge I confesse to be but weake, Yet through thy Strength and Truth I hope to break! These mires of sin, from which mankinde (kept under) Must be let loose like beds of Eeles by thunder. Then that I may mans pride the better see, From all Presumption Lord deliver me. Likewise disperse those foggie mists of sin, That to my purpose have an hindrance bin: And th' evill by thy wisedome I perceive, Lord let thy mercy give me grace to leave: That being free my selfe, I may not coldly Tax others faults, but reprehend them boldly. So having for this good assistance prai'd, My Muse goes forward trusting to thine aide To guide me through the wildernesse of sin, Great Vanities Survey: for being in I see now 'tis an intricate MÃ¦ander, In which (I feare) I shall confus'dly wander. It is a Labyrinth so full of waies, And seemes so endlesse if my pen once straies, As doth the Fisherman amazed stand, That knoweth not which way to rowe to land, When all alone in some close misty day, Farre from the Haven he hath lost his way; Knowing we may as well strike up the maine, As turne unto the wished shore againe: So I doe feare lest this may carry me Into an Ocean where no Sea-markes be. Because what way soere my course I bend, There Vanity I see without all end. Which hath not under her subjection gain'd. Such things alone as are on earth contain'd, Or underneath the Orbs of Aire and Fire, But reaches further and encroches higher: According to his meaning who said plaine, That all things underneath the Sun were vaine. But now I thinke it may a question be, Whether the Sun, the Moon and Stars be free: For sometimes false predictions they impart, Or are belied by abused Art. But of man onely here my Muse must tel's, Who is by much more vaine than all things else. For Vanity his reason over-swaies; Not onely one some certaine Moneths and Daies, But is at all times in him resident, As if it were his proper accident. Neither doth age in which he groweth on, Any thing lessen the proportion Of Vanity he had. But in the steed Of some rejected follies there succeed Others as bad. For we perceive when Boies Begin to man (asham'd of childish toyes) They then leave off their former idle chat, And foolish games; but what's the cause of that? For being ill; no rather they contemne Those bad things, as not bad enough for them. And as one poore plaies first for points and pins; Once waxing rich, leaves that game and begins To venter crownes, and so from day to day Growes more and more asham'd of slender play As he growes abler: So, young men forsake The rope-ripe tricks, that their first age did take Chiefe pleasure in; nor cause they wicked deem them, But being men, they thinke twill not beseeme them. Then hounds and hawks and whores are their delight Quarrels and Brawles doe fit their humors right, Disordred meetings, drunken Revellings, Consuming Dice, and lavish Banquetings, Proud costly Robes. This is the Youngmans veine: Which he that elder is dislikes againe. Not since ill neither: but because his yeeres Him unto other Vanities endeares. As Selfe-conceipt, much care for worldly pelfe, Heaping up what he neare enjoyes himselfe. Prone to Contentions, much desiring still, Be it his weale or woe, to have his will. Extreamly loving lies, and given to prate, Yet making shew as if he both did hate. Yea old men boast of what they did in youth, Which none disprooving, we must take for truth: And thousands more (or else they are belide) Each age is pestred with; And yet beside, Vanities proper unto each degree, Millions of thousands I suppose there be. Princes have these; They very basely can Suffer themselves that have the rule of Man, To be o'er-borne by villaines: so insteed Of Kings they stand, when they are slaves indeed. By bloud and wrong a heavenly Crown they'l danger T'assure their State here (often to a stranger.) They quickly yeeld unto the batteries Of slie insinuating flatteries; Most bountifull to fooles, too full of feare, And farre too credulous of what they heare; So given to pleasure, as if in that thing Consisted all the Office of a King. But if herein my harmelesse halting Rimes, Were onely ti'd unto this Place and Times, And should of none but of my Soveraigne tell, Spight of her heart she could not speake but well. For I suppose (the Truth I must confesse) That Vanity no Prince ere harbor'd lesse Than he hath done, unlesse corrupted stories Rob former ages of deserved glories. If any say, to sooth I now devise, His heart I know will tell his tongue he lies: And did not I thinke true what here I sing, Iustice I would not wrong to please the King. Great men are vaine too, in much seeking fames, With Nimrod and his mates; they raise their names By building Babels. Yea and they suppose, Honour consists in titles and in showes. They Thraso-like in Parasites delight, That doe in presence claw, in absence bite. They use their pleasures not as pleasures now, Or recreations as 'twere fit: but how? 'Tis all their care; their chiefe and only joy; In satisfying which they doe imploy Both wealth and wit and all. If they would take Something in hand for recreations sake, They are with pleasures so o'er-cloid we see, It must be that which their affaires should be: A wondrous Vanity! And all their care Is for rich raiment and the curious fare; Pampring their flesh when all is but in vaine, For dust it was and shall to dust againe. Then sith their evils we seeme not to see, (In vaine) they thinke that they well thought of be. Tush; men doe spare their lewdnesse to repeat; Why? cause th' are faultlesse; No, because th' are great. But for their vices, though now none dare show them Vnlesse they mend, another Age shall know them: And therefore if they count their Honours deare, Let them be good as well as great-men here. Let them leave Vanity, and not suppose The world will ever blinded be with showes. For that great mighty Peere that died lately, Ere while was mighty, powerfull and stately: He was much croucht unto, and much implor'd; Yea, almost, like a Demi-god ador'd. He onely (as my selfe have heard some prate) Was the upholder of the Britanes State. And all the wit this Kingdome did containe, Some thought was harbour'd in his little braine: And had he liv'd (if all be true men say) He might have well beene Pater PatriÃ¦. But now (alas) hee's gone, and all his Fame You see not able to preserve his Name From foule reproch: but each one breakes his mind: Which shewes that though they winkt they were not blind In spight of all his greatnesse, 'tis well known That store of rimes and libels now are sown In his disgrace. But I here divers say. That they are slanders. (Then the more knaves they That were the Authors) but if so it be He were from those vile imputations free; If that his vertue's paid with such a curse, What shall they look for, that are ten-times worse Well Nobles; I'l the Court ere long survay: And if I finde among you such as stray Through vanity or pride (unlesse they be Offences flowing from infirmity) If there be no man that dare tax you for't, My Muse shall doe it; e'en to make me sport. For though she keepe but a plaine hobbling forme, She shall have wit enough to make you storme. I will not spare you thus, till death doth fet yee; But rub you whilst you are alive to fret yee. Yet doe not think I meane to blaze your shame In scattered libels that shall want a name: No, I hate that: I'l tell the ils you doe, And put my name for witnesse thereunto. Then 'tis but fetching me ad Magistratum, And laying to me Scandalum Magnatum: Which though you prove not, rather yet than faile You were best hang or clap me in to Iaile To stay my tongue, so much you may doe to me, And that's the worst I know that you can doe me. But whither runs my over-sawcy pen? There's vanity besides in Noblemen. The Gentleman for some repute but vaine, Beyond his power often times doth straine. Our Yeomen too, that never Armes have borne. To Gentilize it makes themselves a scorne: But their gaine's envy, with a greater charge; Yet of these fooles the Catalogue is large. Then ere that lesson be halfe taken forth, They must adde knight-hood, or 'tis nothing worth. Mony may get it, therefore many sue it, Although with shame and beggery they rue it. And credit they expect in vaine thereby, For it turnes rather to their infamy; Because it is bestowed without deserts: And yet in troth our Knights have done their parts: For most have well deserv'd it; but as how? Bravely in Field; e'en in a field at plow. But why looke we in meere humanity, For that which savours not of vanity; Sith Divine mattars cannot quite be free, But with the same must oft corrupted be? Divines strive not so much how to impart The truest doctrines; as to shew their art. They grace their speech, more with vaine words for sound Than with grave sayings needfull and profound, But 'tis a vaine thing, wondrous full of shame, And in my judgement highly merits blame, To paint o'er that, whose beauty's never fuller Than when it shines forth in its proper colour. Againe, on Accidents they arguing sit, And doe meane while the substance oft omit Of most essentiall matters. And so they stand (With many wrangling spirits in this Land) Vpon such idle questions as they know 'Tis no great matter on which side they goe: And such as best (in my conceit) befits None but unquiet and seditious wits. Here's my opinion: be they not the chiefe Grounds of Religion, or the same Beliefe Salvation comes by, that men goe about By their new-fanglednesse to bring in doubt. So't be not that they touch (as sure they dare not) Let all the rest goe which way twill, I care not. Have not our Lawyers many vaine delaies, Vnnecessary Writs and idle staies, To lengthen out mens suits, when they might foyle The party faulty e'en with halfe that quoyle? They'l for their fee relate some pretty Tale, Like the wise story of old Iackei'th vale, Which (if they once have thorowly begun) Vndoes them quite that tarry til't be done, Iacke Doe, Dicke Roe, with whom y'ad ne'er to doe, They'l bring to help your cause, and God knows who And for your benefit they can afford Many a foolish, senselesse, idle word. Which they I know will not account as vaine, Sith that 'tis with a Vengeance brings them gaine. Besides, as I suppose their Lawes are pend In their old Pedlers French, unto this end The Vulgar should no farther knowledge reach, Than what shall please their Masterships to teach: Or else they have the selfe-same policie That mov'd those Patrons of the Papacy Who Sacred Writ in forraine tongues conceal'd Lest that their knavish tricks should be reveal'd. But, can they not in our owne language finde Words of sufficient force t'expresse their minde? That cannot be denied: but tis a trouble, So easie to counterfeit and double In a knowne tongue; when the other but a few Can understand, but that obstreperous Crew. These make the Lawes almost to none effect; Their courses are so wondrous indirect. To them they favour they delaies can grant, Though Iustice her due expedition want. Sometimes upon one matter we may see, That sundry judgements shall pronounced be: Now there's a motion granted, next day crost, So fee and labours to no purpose lost: And still the Client shall be so deluded, That when he hopes al's done, there's nought concluded Nay though we heare the utmost sentence past, Which by all course of Law should be the last, Why then I say (though all seeme wholy ended) Yet may the Execution be suspended: And for some trifle to the poore mans terror, Be cald in question by a Writ of Error. So that the right oft yeelds unto the stronger, When poore mens purses can hold out no longer. Oh miserable state! What should we say? May not the Country thinke themselves a prey These Ravens live on? May we not suppose By their delaies, and some such tricks as those, They practise onely how to cheat and gull; And on our ruines fill their gorges full? Yes questionlesse, for they themselves doe raise Vnto this height on other mens decaies; Not their owne vertues. Oh, though'it be too late, Yet let me wish that we had kept the state And simple Innocence we once retain'd. For then we had not of this ill complain'd; Nor yet those movers of sedition knowne (Now to a many-headed Monster growne.) But sith that time is past we may complaine, Yet must ne'er looke to see those daies againe. We have good Lawes, but they (too) seem in vaine Sith they according to each Lawyers braine May be now wrested to and fro, to make The matter good that he doth undertake. I'l say it plainely and yet not belie them; There's few but rich men can have justice by them. And pray you judge if that Law be not vaine, Which when it is enacted (to restraine Some priviledge or custome that hath stood As a great hindrance to the publike good) Should of its vertue be so slightly gull'd, As by a licence to be disanull'd. Moreover there be some too much to blame, Or PÅnall Lawes are onely made in vaine; Made in terrorem tantum, to affright, And not for execution of the right. And I may liken them unto those logs That Iupiter threw downe to rule the Frogs: At first they come forth with such thundring terror, That we doe tremble to commit an error: But in a day or two they are so still, For ought I see we may doe what we will: Vnlesse that we be poore, or some despight us. Then peradventure they'l go neere to fright us A twelve-moneth after. If so long they last, Twenty to one then all the furie's past. Did you but note it, you would much admire To see how strictly Iustices enquire On daies of sitting, what abuses raigne: How those they threat, that slackly doe complaine; How they will raile, and fume, and chase, and storme, As if all evils they will quite reforme Within a moment. But things violent Cannot you know be long time permanent. Nor is their zeale, for surely (God amend it) One twice-twelve houres will both begin and end it. But why are they so earnest then? Oh know, That the small springs within the daies below, Glide gently on untill a Land-floud fils Their empty channels from the higher hils, And then they'l swell untill they can discharge Their burthens in some plaine to runne at large: So these low Magistrates would gladly sleepe, And their owne easie crooked channels keepe; But when that any streame of Iustice showers, And comes downe to them from the higher powers, Then peradventure they'l grow big a day, And Iustice shall have course the nearest way: Then in a little space she must be faine To run within their winding banks againe. Some falsely have affirmed Iustice blinde, Yet I am sure she knoweth where to finde (If that shee be disposed there to looke) Who gives her day-workes by her counting-booke. Nay she knowes Capon, Turkie, Goose and Swan, And thee I warrant, from another man What ere thou be. But whilest she sees so plaine, It is no wonder we have Lawes in vaine. Also when officers doe undertake Their charge at first, Lord, what a quoyle they make, A Drunkard cannot with his capring feet Cut out indentures as he walkes the street, But hee's straight stockt for it; or for his offence, By fining to the poore he must dispence. Then those perhaps that slackly doe frequent Gods divine service, somewhat shall be shent; And many other goodly deeds they'l doe, But these grow quickly weary of them too. Againe, sometimes comes out a Proclamation, Which threatens on the paine of Confiscation, That no Recusant doe presume to stay Within ten miles oth' Court, from such a day. Yet sure 'tis notwithstanding meant that some Should dayly to the Presence-chamber come; And shrowd within a furlong on't or two. Some Great-ones may: and so I hope they doe, And by their owne Authority no doubt. May keepe the rest from danger thereabout. Pish; they at such a matter will but scoff, Cause they know surely how to put it off, Yet I'l not say it is in vaine, for why? The peoples heads are set on worke thereby: And 'tis moreover for our satisfaction, Who else might thinke the State were out of action. But oh you noble English Senators, Our Kingdomes Guard, and Princes Counsellors, How can you see your labours so misus'd? Or brooke to have your Soveraigne so abus'd; Doe you suppose that it deserves no blame, To make a Scar-crow of the Regall Name? And to erect it on some common stall, There to be gaz'd on, to no end at all: Respect it more and use it not for course Or fashions sake, but shew it hath some force. Pluck out those vipers that for feare of harme Their chilled spirits in your bosomes warme. Perceive you not their stings? No danger feare yee; Oh 'tis apparent let them not shrowd neare yee; For if they doe, 'tis doubtlesse the conclusion, If God prevent not, will be your confusion. Yet all (for ought I see) should still remaine, Were there not some, who (out of zeale to gaine More than Religion, or their Countries weale) Their scurvy base conditions to reveale, In begging and in trifling of some few. But they their owne corruptions rather shew Than redresse any. More I here could utter But I me thinks already heare some mutter, As if I should be sure of Romes great curse: But then I'me sure I shall be ne'er the worse. Yea, let them goe to Rome, curse, ban and spare not, I'l sit at home and laugh; because I care not. But why do I of Lawes alone complaine, Sith all man deales in, is in some sort vaine? Religion is with Ceremonies stuft, And with vaine-glory and presumption puft. Now our Almes-deeds, and gifts of charity, Are done for shew and with hypocrisie. Yea, all's made vaine: for if you would but view Our Vniversities, indeed 'tis true There you may yet see, how that heretofore, In better daies, have beene erected store Of Palaces; (which curious built are still A faire remembrance of the worke-mens skill) Which, lest that knowledge in the land should fade, Were by the Patrons of good learning made, That there the Muses (shelter'd from the rages Of former, present, and succeeding ages) Might safely live, and not beholding be To Pyren for his hospitality. 'Tis also true, there wants not to sustaine Their proper needs, nor yet to entertain Such as desire knowledge. There's enough; The worthy Founders have provided so. But of these profits why now make they stay? Best sell't, or let some Courtier beg't away. For publike gifts ere turn'd to private uses, Faire Colledges are full of foule abuses. And their Revenues I account as vaine, Because they lazie Dunces do maintaine, Who to themselves doe claime the profits, by Nothing but witlesse Seniority. Such as have Beard (with reverence be't spoken) Of profound learning have not marke, nor token. Good Founders dreaming not of these Abuses, Gave them at first to charitable uses: But we finde now all alter'd, and the due Which should by right upon desert ensue, Like sfioces in Court, is bought and sold: And places may be had, but how? for gold. There as elsewhere they now are growne so bad, Without Quid dabis, nothing can be had. 'Tis strange to see what Avarice can doe. But, are the Muses taken with it too? Oh no: for they esteeme such gaine a losse; And their high spirits scorne such earthly drosse. How then? There are some Cormorants crept in, Who in their youth pretended to have bin Addicted unto knowledge; when alas, 'Tis well seene since that all their purpose was To snort in ease; augmenting still their store, Till they grew wealthy and their houses poore. Foule Droanes whose voices must be hir'd with mony Starving the bees while they devoure the hony. But oh you birds of Athens, cleere your hals, And drive those lazie Hornets from your stals. Through them it is men thinke you covetous, They make your groves and walks grow scandalous. But how will you discerne them? marry thus Sith they have made themselves notorious, I'l point them out: And though their heads they shrowd As Venus did Ãneas in a cloud, I'l so unmaske them; if their eares they show, You shall be able to say, There they goe. First note them, there are some by bribes and fees Can soone passe thorow two or three degrees: And if they sue for ought are not deni'd it, When better Students must be put beside it. Then there be others who their nests to feather, Can keepe an Office nineteene yeeres together, Enforcing many unto penury, To have therewith to feed their luxury. Note you not some at fifty winters study, That have their wits so thin, and braines so muddy, They must procure of other men to doe Those exercises they were cal'd unto? And sit there not of Dunces pretty store From Sun to Sun at every Tradesmans dore? Huge fat curmudgeons? Tell me (I thinke no) Doe commons of three halfe-pence feed them so? Or can such puffes so Humberkin-like set, Into a Pulpet once in seven yeere get? Sure if they doe, their memories so weake, When they come there they know not what to speak. Nor are they halfe so fit if't came to proofe, To serve for Pastors as to hang at roofe. It is no marvell then that blockish rout Retaine their places and keepe better out; For no good patron that doth conscience raake, Will unto them the charge of soules betake, Because, if such the flocke of Christ should keepe, No question they would make but carrion sheepe. Then they must stay; yet in their stay they'l be A plague unto the Vniversitie. For over and above the mischiefes nam'd, The Vice for which the younger sort is blam'd They are most guilty of. For forced to tarry, Through want, and by their lawes forbid to marry: Thence springs it that the Townesmen are reputed, Thus by a common voice to be cornuted. For I have knowne that such have daily beene Where younger schollers never durst be seene. And all (unlesse that they have eies like Moles) May see those Foxes use the Badgers holes. Nor hath their lewdnesse in the action staid, But on the place a fouler blemish laid. Which here indeed I doe forbeare to name, Lest it be to the place I love, a shame. And for because I feare some spitefull mate May tax them with it who such dealing hate, Brought in by them, for who is so impure, But he that liveth like an Epicure? Oh Muses, seeke in time to roote these weeds, That marre your gardens and corrupt your seeds. And you that are appointed Visitors, Who ought to have bene strict inquisitors, To search the foule abuses of these times And see them punish'd; Oh let these my rimes Move you to helpe reforme this villanie; Or let the hate of damned perjurie Stir up your zeal these evils to restraine, It not for love of good for feare of paine. Which else (though you set light as at your heele) As sure as God is just your soules shall feele. Doe you not see now, all the wondrous cost Of worthy Benefactors vainly lost? The Lands, Revenues, Customs, Charters, Rents Which they have left for divers good intents, Vainely imploi'd? See the Student poore For whom it was ordain'd, stands at the doore And may not enter; whilst the golden Asse Is quietly admitted in to passe. And shroud himselfe within those sacred gates, Which were't not for commoditie, he hates. You sacred Genii that did once attend Those well devoted Patrons to their end; Although your bodies be entomb'd in clay, Since you survive (because you live for aye) Looke downe on your abused gifts, and see What ods twixt th' use and your good meanings be. Come and behold, how the laborious sits Sharing some hungry Commons, scarce two bits; (And that but when a double gauday haps, Full glad alas at other times with scraps) While that the lazie Dunce on dainties feeds. Oh come (I say) if you respect your deeds, And fright them with some ghastly visions thence, They may have more remorse for their offence. If I could take on me some hideous forme, I'de either make them their bad lives reforme, Or feare them quick to hell. But I am vaine, To call for your assistance or complaine, Because I doubt this fault will ne'er be mended Vntill all evill with the world be ended. Learning is vaine too; or so made at least, Consider it, I speake it not in jest: Doe we not see that those who have consum'd Halfe a mans age in Schooles, and have assum'd Degrees of Art, and hourely overlooke Many a leafe, many a wisemans booke, Still study to know, fellowes that can, As they themselves thinke put downe any man That dares of PrÃ¦dicables to dispute, Yea, such as can too if need be, refute Knowne truths; and that in Metaphysicall, Much more I think, in matters Naturall Seeme greatly read, doe we not see, I say? That these from study being tane away For some imployments in the Publike-weale, Are such as it might shame them to reveale Their simple cariage, sooner they'l speak Treason, Than any thing that shall be law or reason. Aske their opinion but of this or that, They'l tell a tale they scarcely know of what: And at the last, you must be well appaid, With This the Poet, or This Tully said. So other mens opinions shall be showne, But very seldome any of their owne. What is't to heare up a great multitude Of words and sayings like a Chaos rude? To say a Latine Disticke out of Cato, Cite Aristotle or some peece of Plato. And divers more, yet like a blockish Elfe, Be able to say nought at all himselfe? As if it were all well, and he had plaid it, If he can once say, Such a man hath said it. Then by their actions who gather can They have more knowledge than another man; Sith they doe worse absurdities commit Than those that seeme their juniors in wit? As if they thought it were enough to know, And not with knowledge unto practise go. Those may be learned, and of learning prate; But for affaires of Country or of State, In my conceipt they are as farre unfit As fooles and madmen that have lost their wit: And notwithstanding all their studious paine, I count their Learning and their Knowledge vaine. But thinke not that I Knowledge fruitlesse deem, Or count those men who in the Academe Doe spend their times, unfitting men to deale About imployments of the Common-weale. No; for I ever this account did make, That there are those know best to undertake Great Offices; and surely such as have Both knowledge and desert: yet shall they save But their owne credits. Th' other who are known To have no gifts of nature of their own, For all their knowledge gotten in the Schooles, Are worse by much ods than unlearned Fooles. Now thou that wouldst know rightly these mens state Goe but a while and talke with Coriate, And thou wilt soone be able to maintaine, And say with me, that Learning's some-where vaine, Then if there were ordain'd no other place, Where now despised-vertue should have grace, She were vaine too, and those that lov'd her best, Were to be counted vaine above the rest. For they be sure of all these worldly crosses, That whosoever gaine, their's must be the losses, Iustice is wanting so: for if that men Commit an ill the Law gives smart; but when They doe performe a vertuous deed (tis hard) There's no Law here that gives them a reward. Nay, if a man by wrong suspition be Brought into any wofull misery, If he be rackt and tortur'd so, that Death May pleasure him by stopping of his breath: And if at last by proofes it doth appeare. That he of the suspected crime is cleare, Onely he may his life by that meanes save, But shall no other satisfaction have. Yea, and he must be glad and well content He hath his life for being innocent: Where of he would full glad have ridden bin, To scape the torments they had plung'd him in. 'Tis meere Injustice. And I say againe, In this Age to be good it were in vaine. But that it one day shall rewarded be By heavens Chiefe-Iustice, with Eternity. I will not here endeavour to reveale, The vaine Trades crept into our common-weale: Onely I say (and so I thinke will any,) Would lesse there were for such there be too many. But I must needs declare their vanity Who build their treasure and felicity On things meere frivolous as honour, strength, Pleasure and wealth and beauty; which at length, Yea in short time must fade. High Titles plac'd Without desert are not alone disgrac'd, And lose that reputation of their owne; But shame them too, on whom they are bestowne. What's Noblenesse of birth but meerely vaine? Vnlesse that in the linage there remaine Some noble qualities, which in them bred, They have deriv'd from predecessors dead? What's honour, but e'en smoke and idle fame? A thing consisting onely in a name; Which if you take away then you take all, For Alexanders glory was not small: Yet were he namelesse, what would then remaine, His honourable Titles to retaine, Sith that his best part from the earth is fled, And th' other, though remaining here, now dead? Then if that honour no advantage bring To soule nor body, but doth wholly cling Vnto the name who care or paines would take, (If he be wise) a Trophie vaine to make Vnto the same, which may enjoyed be By many thousand other men; whilst he Rots. And which three mens vertues (I'l maintaine) Grace not so much, as one mans vice shall staine? Were't onely for a name that men did well, And strove in vertues others to excell, What good had Simon the Apostle gain'd More than the wicked Sorcerer obtain'd? And how should we give each of them his fame, Who living, being two, had but one name? Were outward honour all that vertue got, He were a wise man that esteem'd it not. But shee's the bodies comfort till it die, And soules companion to eternity. Vulgar Repute; what is thereby acquir'd? Why is't so glorious, and so much desir'd? But I doe chiefly marvell what they ment, That have preferr'd it before their owne content. I hold it vaine and wondrous frivolous, Extreamely foolish and ridiculous, That any man should stand in greater feare What he doth unto other men appeare Than to himselfe; or strive so much (poore Elves) To seeme to other Gods; when to themselves, Th' are worse than divels. Why, I say, should they With vaine repute be so much born away? And why boast men of strength that last no longer And seeing the bruit creatures are farre stronger. A woman may blind Sampson with her charmes, And little David slay a man at armes; For God doth make (as holy Scriptures speake,) Strong things to be confounded by the weake. Then some are vaine in pleasures; like to him Who for because he in delights would swim, (In these our daies) to please his bestiall senses, Made twenty hundred crownes one nights expences, I onely doe forbeare to tell his name, Lest he should hap to vaunt upon the same. But why in Beauty should men glory so; As well we may perceive there's many do; Sith 'tis no better than a fading flower, That flourishes and withers in an hower? It would not save the good King Davids sonne, From being justly by his foes undone: Nay there's scarce any that enjoy the same Can keepe unto themselves an honest Name. We see moreover men vaine-glorious grow, In building and apparell; all's for shew; And yet the Prince that's gorgious in array, Must lie as naked as his Groome in clay. And though that men to build so curious be, How worthy of contempt it is we see, In that th' arch-King of heaven, earth and all, Was very well contented with a Stall. What minde are they in, who suppose to raise By such a vanity an endlesse praise? When as they daily see by observation, Time utterly decaies the strong'st Foundation. Where are those wonderous high Pyramides, That were admired at in former daies? And of those huge Colossi what remaines? (Which to erect now were an endlesse paines) Nothing almost; no scarce his name that spent The paine and cost of such a Monument: If that be so, how much more vanity Is it to hope for Fames eternity, By such slight trifles whose ground-worke needs mending Before the roofe be brought unto an ending? Again, some thinke how ere their lives they spend, Yet if they can attaine to in the end A glorious Funerall and be interr'd With idle pompe and show, or be preferr'd In a bald Sermon for some one good deed They did the Common-wealth, for their own need: Or by their owne, or friends procurement have On their unworthy scarce-deserved grave A goodly Epitaph; they thinke al's well. Alas poore silly men! what can they tell How long 'twill stand before't be razed downe? But say it bide a while; what faire renowne Can in a peece of Carved Marble be? What can a gilded Tombe then profit thee? Preserve thy fame, I know it cannot passe The wondrous heape that once erected was, And yet e'en at this present doth remaine Not farre from Sarum on the Westerne plaine. Yet who can say directly (or what story Doth absolutely mention) for whose glory That first was founded? or by whom? or why? And if a deed of such great wonder die. Dost thou suppose by a few carved stones, (Scarcely enough to cover o'er thy bones) To be immortall if thou long to live After thy death, let noble vertue give And adde that living glory to thy name. Let her sound forth the trumpet of thy fame, And it shall last. For she knowes how to place it: Where Time nor Envy shall have power to race it. I say, endeavour to be vertuous here, So shall thy sacred memory be deere To those that live; and whilst thy body lies Entomb'd on earth, thy soule shall mount the skies. But if in pleasure thou hast lived long, And tooke delight in seeking bloud and wrong: When that the evill day shall come to end thee, The curse of the oppressed shall attend thee, Thy soule shall pray for't, and the selfesame grave Thou for thy honour didst suppose to have, Shall be thy shame; for those that travell by it, Shall often curse it, yea deride, defie it; And to each other say, There doth he lye, That acted such or such a villany. Then why should gay clothes be delighted in Sith they are but a badge of our first sin? And yet 'tis strange to know how many fashions We borrow now adaies from other Nations. Some we have seene in Irish trouzes goe, And they must make it with a codpeece too, Some (as the fashion they best like) have chose The spruce diminutive neat French-mans hose. Another lik't it once but now he chops, That fashion for the drunken Switzers slops. And cause sometimes the fashions we disdaine Of Italy, France, Netherland and Spaine, Weele fetch them farther off. For by your leaves, We have Morisco gownes, Barbarian sleeves, Polonian shooes, with divers far-fetcht trifles, Such as the wandring English Gallant rifles Strange Countries for. Besides our Taylors know How best to set apparrell out for show. It either shall be gathered stitcht or lac'd, Else plaited, printed, jagd, or cut and rac'd, Or any way according to your will, For wee have now adaies learn'd much vain skill. But note you, when these gue-gawes once be made, And that this cunning Master of his Trade Must bring it home. For, there lies all the jest, To see when the poore slave hath done his best To mend what faults he can (for by his trade, He can set right what Nature crooked made) When he hath fitted to his power, and trickt, Whom he would please when he hath brusht &amp; pickt E'en till he sweat againe: Yet (though he spies Scarce any fault) You rogue, the Gallant cries, A plague confound thee; looke here how this sits; Zounds, 'tis a mile too wide, where were thy wits? See, this is halfe too long, that halfe too short, 'Sblood I could find in heart to knocke thee for't. Then for the faults behind he lookes in Glasse: Strait raves againe; and cals his Taylor Asse, Villaine, and all the Court-like names he can, Why I'l be judg'd (saies he) here by my man, If my left shoulder seeme yet, in his sight, For all this bumbast, halfe so big's the right. How is he serv'd? This day he should have went With such a Lord or Lady into Kent; To Hampton-Court to morrow comes the Queen, And there should he with certaine friends have been Villaine (he cries) goe instantly and mend it: And see with all the speed you can, you send it: Or by his sword the Gallant sweares, he will Make thee to wait twice twelve-months with thy bill If ere he pay thee. Then the other takes it, Carries it home againe, turnes, rubs and shakes it, Lets it lie still an houre or so, and then As if 'twere alter'd, beares it back againe; Then 'tis so fit, our Gallant cannot tell, That ere he had apparell made so well. Ere while saies he, faith I was angr'd sore, Why couldst thou not have done it thus afore? With many gentle speeches in amends, And so these two, vaine fooles, grow quickly friends What shall I say of our superfluous fare? Our beastly veine, and to excessive care To please the belly? We, that once did feed On homely roots and hearbs, doe now exceed The Persian Kings for dainties. In those Cotes A man would thinke they liv'd with Hay and Oates The Diet they are growne unto of late, Excels the Feasts that men of high estate Had in times past. For, there's both flesh and fish; With many a dainty new devised dish. For bread, they can compare with Lord and Knight, They have both, raveld, manchet, browne and white, Of finest Wheat. Their drinks, are good and stale: Of Perry, Cider, Mead, Metheglin, Ale, Or Beere they have abundantly. But then This must not serve the richer sort of men. They with all sorts of forraigne Wines are sped; Their cellars are oft fraught with White and Red, Be't French, Italian, Spanish, if they crave it: Nay, Grecian or Canarian, they may have it. Cate, Pument, Vervage (if they doe desire) Or Romney, Bastard, Capricke, Osey, Tire, Muscadell, Malmsey, Clarey; what they will, Both head and belly each may have their fill. Then if their stomacks doe disdaine to eate Beefe, Mutton, Lambe, or such like Butchers meat: If that they cannot feed of Capon, Swan, Ducke, Goose, or common houshould Poultry; then Their store-house will not very often faile, To yeeld them Partrich, Phesant, Plover, Quaile, Or any dainty fowle that may delight Their gluttonous, and beastly appetite. So they are pampred whilst the pooreman starves. Yet there's not all; for Custards, Tarts, Conserves, Must follow too; And yet they are no let For Suckers, March-panes, nor for Marmalet; Fruite, Florentines, sweet Sugar-meates and spices, (With many other idle fond devices) Such as I cannot name, nor care to know. And then besides, the taste, this made for show. For they must have it colour'd, gilded, printed, With shapes of beasts and fowles: cut, pincht, indented So idlely, that in my conceit 'tis plaine, They are both foolish and exceeding vaine. And howsoe'er they of religion boast, Their belly is the God they honour most. But see whereto this daintinesse hath brought us, The time hath beene that if a Famine caught us, And left us neither sheepe, nor Oxe, nor Corne, Yet unto such a diet were we borne, (Were we not in our Townes kept in by th' Foe) The woods and fields had yeelded us enough To content Nature: And then in our needs Had we found either leaves, or grasse, or weeds, We could have liv'd as now there doth and can With good contentment many an Irish man. But in this age if onely wheat doe rise To any extraordinary prize: Or if we have but cheese or butter scant, (Though almost nothing else that is, we want) Yord how we murmur, grumble, fret and pine, As if we would upbraide the Powers Divine! Tea, daily to provoke God, as the Iewes Did in the wildernesse is now no newes. But you that are so like to sterve in plenties, Because you are a little barr'd your dainties: Leave off your Luxurie, let me intreat; Or there will come a Famine shall be great; When soule nor body neither shall have food, Or any thing to comfort them that's good. We talke of scarcity: yet here there came No want this twenty ages worth the name Of Famine, but our gentle God hath bin Exceeding mercifull unto our sin, Wheat at ten shillings, makes no dearth of bread, Like theirs where once (we read) an Asses head Cost fourescore silver peeces: Doves dung Was highly priz'd: and Mothers eate their young. There Famine raign'd. Pray in the like we fall not If we can fast with Ninivie we shall not. But truly much I feare the same; unlesse, We doe leave off our gluttonous excesse. For though we quaffe and swill much time away, Yet three set-meales will scarce suffice a day To satisfie our lust; whereas but one Suffic'd our Predecessors, sometime none It were a worke too tedious here to quote The sundry Vanities that we may note Sprung from this Greedinesse. As our Long sitting. A custome, rather, in my minde, befitting Pagans and Epicures, than honest men, But 'tis a use now common growne. And then, This Foolery we have: We nothing deeme That merits our desiring, or esteeme, Save that which we have either dearely bought, Or far-away from forraigne kingdomes brought. Yea notwithstanding here in this our Land, Those things be better and more neere at hand; Yet we out of an idle humour are So much more pleased with all forraine ware Than with our owne that we the same detest; And this our vainenesse doth not onely rest In meats and in apparell; but 'tis shown In many things we least affect our owne. Our home-made cloth, is now too course a ware, For Chyna and for Indian stuffs we are. For Turkey Grow-graines Chamblets, silken Rash, And such like new devised forraine trash. Yea, though our native Country-men excell In any Trade, we like them not so well As we doe Strangers: and (in very deed) I thinke for vaine inventions they exceed. And then more over; when we doe not want Any good wholesome, Hearb, or Fruit, or Plant, That may be necessary, fit or good, Either to serve for Physick or for food, Yet, those we sleight, as if we did abhor them, And send to seeke in other Kingdomes for them, So, while we onely make our use of them; Our better home-bred Simples we contemne. (Oh Vanity) our Country yeelds enough, What need we GrÃ¦cian or Arabian stuffe? Why send we for them to those Countries thus? 'Twas planted there for them, and not for us. What though it helpe them of diseases there? The Climate, yea, and our complexions are So different (for ought that I can gather,) Here't may not helpe our griefes, but poyson's rather, That Opium which a Turk in safety will Devoure at once, two Englishmen would kill. And as I've heard experienc'd men to say, That which will salve their wounds within a day Who of the farthest Easterne Countries be, Will not re-cure an Englishman in three. Then sure if we should use that med'cine here, It would not helpe nor cure us in a yeere. Trust me; I think, this over-much respecting Of forraigne drugs, and foolishly neglecting Our native simples, is the cause that we So little better for our Physick be. Some in their writings praise Tobacco much: Perhaps the vertue of it may be such As they have said; where first the simple grew. But, if it be re-planted here a new, From it owne soile where Natures hand did place it; I dare not with those properties to grace it Which there it had: Nor can the vertue bide, When 'tis transported to our Region dri'd. Yet, 'tis almost a wonder to behold, How generally now both young and old Suck on that Foraine weed. For so they use it, Or rather (to speake right) so they abuse it, In too oft taking; that a man would thinke It were more needfull than their meat or drink: But what's their reason? Doe not aske them why, For neither can they tell you that, nor I: Vnlesse't be this: So they have seene some doe: And therefore they forsooth must use it too. Nay wonder not: The Sun lights not a Nation That more affecte hapish imitation, Than doe we English. Should we some man see To weare his doublet where his hose should be, Pluck gloves on's feet, and put his hands in's shooes, Or weare his Rings or Iewels on his toes; And come so tired to our English Court, Attended in some strange prepost'rous sort. Some of our Courtiers would make much ado, But they would get into that fashion too. For they so idle are that if they see Those that with Rhume a little troubled be, Weare on their faces a round Mastick patch, Their fondnesse I perceive is apt to catch That for a fashion. Nay, we cannot name That thing so full of Barbarisme and shame That they'l not imitate. Witnesse this smoake, Which, though at first it was enough to choake Or stifle up the sense; though twere unpleasing In tast and savour; oftentimes diseasing The takers bodies. Yet, like men halfe mad, (Not knowing neither what effect it had) Onely because a rude and savage Nation Took't for some unknowne need, they'l make't a fashion. Alas, what profit England at thy need Hast thou attain'd to, by this Indian weed? What hath it lengthen'd life, or maintain'd health, Or hath it brought thee more increase of wealth? It dries superfluous moisture, doth't indeed? Tane with discretion it may stand in need: And surely it deserves to be excus'd, Being with honest moderation us'd. But I doe greatly wonder what they ment, That first did tak't in way of Complement. For now it is as common at each meeting, As how'd yee, or God save yee, for a greeting. Hee's no good fellow that's without the Pox, Burnt pipes, Tobacco and his tinder-box. And there, there be some who scarce abide it, Yet alwaies will for company provide it: With whom (though they alone the same eschew) They'l take it ill they spet and cough and spue. Me thinks they may as well sith this they'l doe, At all their meetings take purgations too. There's not a Tinker, Cobler, Shepheard now, Or rascall Ragamuffin that knowes how, In a blinde Alehouse to carouse a pot, Or swagger kindly, if he have it not. You shall have some among them will not sticke To sweare that they are for Tobacco sick; When by their raged out-sides you would gather It were for want of bread or victuals rather. And so I tak't. But now if you deny Th' affecting forraigne drugs, a vanity, Yet you I hope will grant (because 'tis plaine) The using of Tobacco thus is vaine: I meane in those that daily sit and smoake Alehouse and Taverne, till the windowes roake. And you must yeeld that we now justly sumus E'en as the old verse sayes, flos, fÅnum, fumus. Some vainly much Acquaintance seeke to get, And often in a Strangers cause will sweat: Yet these, where their best services are due, So much their charity will scarsely shew. The love of men some labour to attaine, And they have just the travell for their paine. For what's the favour or the love of Men? A thing long getting and soone lost agen. Him I have knowne whose company hath seem'd In the appearance to be so esteem'd By many that in shew he hath appear'd To be more nearely to their soules indear'd Than their owne bloud. And surely for the time, (But that Inconstancie's a humane crime) He hath beene so: For when he hath departed, As if his absence inwardly had smarted, Out of their eies full oft against their will, I have seene sorrow look and teares to trill. And yet againe hath my Experience seene The selfe-same Man that hath so made of beene, Even of those men he hath beene so respected, After some absence, either much neglected, Wholly forgotten or they so estranged, As if their love and good conceit were changed. Which having found, weighed well the end, And thought them vaine that on the like depend. Also, me thinks it makes me pretty sport To note the vainenesse of the greater sort: How full of congees, courtesies and greetings, Embracements, and kind words they are at meetings; And oft what memorandums past betweene, Of great good turnes, that nere perhaps have been, What commendations and Ioyes there be, For one anothers good prosperity; When howsoever they their malice smother, They care not what becomes of one another. To see me well, hee's glad at heart one cries, When 'tis well known, that in his heart he lies. Another bids me welcome to my face, When he would leave my presence for my place. Yea, and to sweare it too, he will not tremble, Although he knowes I know he doth dissemble. Which in my judgement is a vanity Too full of shamelesse grosse absurdity; And I much wonder men delight to spend Time that's so precious, to so little end, As to consum't in idle complement, And not so much as to a good intent: Crouching and kneeling, when each peasant knowes, Much courtesie, much craft, the Proverb goes. A quality beseeming men I deeme't, Ay to be courteous and I much esteem't: Yet sure, without good meaning 'tis unfit, And extreame vaine when men are cloyd with it. When some mans Table's furnished with stole, Of dainties that a Prince can have no more, Hee'l bid you welcome, though that by your cheare It doth not (as hee'l say himselfe) appeare: And yet he sees and knowes well that his Board. Have what the Water, Earth and Ayre affords: With Pray ye eate, I drink t'yee, nay be merry, And such like words; I oft have beene as weary To thanke, to pledge, and say I doe not spare, As ere was Sommers of his trotting Mare. I often have observed in our Feasts, A vanity which each free minde detests; And this it is; when any one intends For merriment to entertaine his friends, And for them all things needfull doth prepare, That they may well perceive they welcome are; He marres the bounty of his loving feast By his ill chusing some untastefull guest. For so it often haps he doth invite Some lofty State-man or proud neighboring-Knight Who marres their freedome by his expectation Of more than necessary observation. And he must be a slave unto that guest, Contenting him, though he displease the rest. This folly is: Were I as he; my Board Should never entertaine the Knight or Lord In way of feasting, that allow'd not mee To be as merry and as blith as hee: Or that through his disdaine would think amisse To beare some jests of mine, as I beare his: For who but fools would while their guest is baiting Stand with bare-heads, like Ale-house keepers waiting (As if they were some strangers wanted chearing) In their owne houses, while they domineering Say what they list. Be therefore rul'd by me, Bid none but equals if you'l merry be. At least let them be such as can abide, To lay Superiority aside. Moreover (if they have the providence To bid their friends and keep their Mar-feasts thence) They are too lavish and doe much devise, How the they appetite may best suffice. But 'tis a signe their understanding's small That can afford them no discourse at all, It shewes a shallow pate and muddy braine, When men have nothing else to entertaine Their friends withall, but whiffes of smoke, or drink, Or curious fare; as if that they did think They could not shew their honest love unlesse They did abound in Gluttonons excesse. But there be many greedy-guts indeed, That will finde fault unlesse their Cates exceed. Such Socrates shewes how to answer best; Who having for his friends prepar'd a feast, And hearing one to discommend his store, Told him directly, Friend, there needs no more: For be they vertuous, here's enough for such; If otherwise (quoth he) there is too much. A fitter answer we can never find For such nice Gluttons; differing in mind From certaine deare and learned Friends of mine; Whom when I late requested had to dine Or sup with we one night would not agree, Vnlesse I dresse what they appointed me, I will, said I, and not a bit beside: Why then (quoth they) we charge thee to provide One dish, no more. (We love not him that crams:) And let our second course be Epigrams. So much they found with more good mirth &amp; laughing Than those that had their dainties and their quaffing. Who can declare what vanity man shewes In hearing and reporting idle newes? The foolish tales and lies, that he doth faine, Are more than any numbers can contain. And now I think on that same lying-evill, (A mischiefe first invented by the Devill) I cannot chuse but greatly wonder why Men should delight so in that Vanity. It is not onely vicious and base, But also doth their credits quite deface. And Truth out of their mouthes is mis-esteem'd, Because, oft lying, they are lyers deem'd. I mean not any falshoods to maintain, No though they be Officious or for gain. Yet worse do like them, who their wits do bend To coyn new tales unto no other end But to provide the company some talk, And cause they love to heare their own tongues walk. Some I have known (judge of their vanity) That have told tales to their own infamie, And yet untrue, 'tis like they have small care Of others credits, when they will not spare To wrong themselves. Another crew beside Among these Lyars I have also spide, Who (as it may appeare) did like so well Strange news and matters past beleefe to tell, That notwithstanding they do surely know It makes not onely modest eares to glow, But that 'tis known they lie, yet still they dare Gainst Truth, their own, &amp; all mens knowledge sweare: Yea, when they may as well, and speak as right, Swear that each man is blinde, and all crows white. Which is a daring and a lew'd offence, Sprung from a brazen, hellish impudence. Then there's a number too, that do suppose, All that beyond their little reason growes Is surely false; And vainly do uphold, That all reports which Travellers unfold Of forreigne Lands are lies, because they see No such strange things in their own Parish be; If that I may not tearme such fellows vain, Ile say they're dull, and of a shallow brain: And him I count no wise man that imparts To men of such base misconceiving hearts Any rare matter, for their bruitish wit Will very quickly wrong both him and it. For thus the saying goes, and I hold it so, Ignorance onely is true wisdomes foe. Then thou art vain that wilt vouchsafe to spend Thy breath with witlesse people to contend In weighty matters; when it is well known They'l like of no opinions but their own: Ever disabling what thou didst recite, Yea, notwithstanding it be ne'er so right. And be their own case false, and all amisse, They'l prove it true, How? Thus, Because it is. So if there be no more wise-men in place, Thou bear'st the shame, and they'l have all the grace And yet the mischiefe hath not there an end: For tell me, you that ever did contend With such; is not their wayward disputation A meer confusion, and a strong vexation? I know 'tis so, for I my selfe have tride it, And since that time could never yet abide it. But let those follow vanity together With purblinde ignorance; and Ile send thither To keep them company those that take pleasure In tedious discourse; they be at leasure: And those that love to heare their own tongues walk Still seeking opportunity of talk, Shall not stay from them. Yet I have beheld More vanities which must not be conceal'd: As foolish wishes. Many a silly Asse Covets those things that cannot come to passe. Another, that in wishing is as heedlesse, Desires some trifling bables which are needlesse. Nay I have heard without regard or shame Such beastly wishes as I blush to name. What damn'd infernall curses can each brother In every angry fit wish one another? When such as these their jesting words they'l make yee, A Pox, a Pestilence, and a Murraine take yee. Which if the Lord should in his justice send them, Their own vain wishes would e're long time end th? Some free-born men I have observed too, Who are thought wise, yet very vainly doe. These, as if they lack'd troubles of their own, For other men are slaves and drudges grown. I tax not such as honestly have stood In the maintaining a poore neighbours good; But rather those who are so out of measure Enur'd to be for other men at leasure, That they can finde almost no time to be Employd about their own commoditie. Others there are more knavish, and as vain, Who seeming carefull of anothers gain, Intrude themselves into their actions; when 'Tis not for any good they wish the men, But for this cause, and sure for nothing more, In each mans Boat they love to have an Oare. 'Tis good to look to their affaires; but yet I hold it for a vain thing and unfit We should be vexed with such extream care In following them, as many times we are: For, unto me it seems, the greatest part, Take businesse not in hand now, but in heart. What mean our wealthy Vsurers to hoord More up for others than they can afford Vnto themselves? Whereas they do not know Whether it shall be for a friend or foe, Sure such me thinks should be deservedly. Recorded for their sottish vanity. Now, as the most of wealth too-well do deem, So others make thereof too-small esteem, As of a thing whose use were of no weight, But both are led away with vain conceit. Then some mans care is, that when this life ends, He dying, may be buried with his friends; As if he fear'd his foes had not forgotten To do him mischiefe though their bones were rotten Others extreamly are distempered, To think what men will do when they are dead; And vainly sit (more wit God one day send) Lamenting what they know not how to mend. For worthlesse matters some are wondrous sad: Whom if I call not vain, I must terme mad. If that their noses bleed some certain drops, And then again upon the sudden stops: Or if the babling fowl we call a Iay, A Squirrell, or a Hare but crosse the way: Or if the salt fall towards them at table, Or any such like superstitious bable, Their mirth is spoil'd, because they hold it true That some mischance must thereupon ensue. But I do know no little numbers be Seduced with this foolish vanitie. And questionlesse although I discommend it, There want not some that stoutly will defend it! But all their proofe is onely this I know, By daily triall they do finde it so, Indeed 'tis true, God often by permission, To see if they will trust to superstition More than to him, doth willingly supply What they so look'd for by their Augurie. Then some to be esteemed men of state, Of nothing but the Court affaires do prate If they but come amongst us Countrey-men, Lord, what Magnificoes they will be then! Yea, though they blow but the Kings Organ-bellows, We must suppose them Earls and Barons fellows Or else we wrong them. 'Twas my chance to light In a friends house, where one of these that night Took up his lodging; at the first I deem'd him A man of some great place, and so esteem'd him; And he took me for some soft Countrey gull, Thinking my wit (as 'tis indeed) but dull. But I perceiv'd his pride, I must confesse, And seem'd as if I had a great deale lesse. I made him more fine Congees by a score, Than e're he had at Court in's life before, The worship and the honour too I gave him, But from the charge of either I dare save him. Yet my high termes so pleas'd the Courtiers vein, That up he rips the news of France and Spain, Of Germany, of Denmark, and of Sweed; And he had French store, therefore I took heed. Then next he tells me all their life at Court, Relates S. Georges showes, and Christmas sport, With such like talk; which I in shew desir'd, And (as I ne'er had seen't before) admir'd: Which he perceiving falleth to devise More strange reports, and tells me sundry lies, Which still I wondred at; and in his talk I noted, though his tongue did ever walk He never spake of others than the best: For Earls, and Lords, and Ladies were the least I heard him mentioning; when sure the foole Is but some servant to the Groom 'oth stoole. But howsoever for this once he passes, To shew the nature of his fellow-Asses. I am afraid 'twill be to little end, If I should words and precious leasure spend To tell our Gallants what vain frivolous Discourse they have, and how ridiculous They are at meetings. I have been for laughter Often beholding to them a week after. And trust me, Ile not give a Cue so soon To see an Ape, a Monkey, or Baboon Play his forc'd tricks; as I would give a Tester, To come and view them and their Apish gesture, When they are either frolike in their Cans, Or courting of their light-heel'd Curtezans. They think themselves fine men (I know they doe) What will they give me and Ile think so too? And yet I shall not sure, do what I can, They have so little in them that is man For my few yeares have noted many fruits Producted in fine silks and satten sutes Worth observation: I could now recite Their brave behaviour in their Mistresse sight: But sure they'l ne'er endur't, they cannot do't, Yet if I list now I could force them to't. But lo I spare them, th' are beholding to me, And may (perhaps) as great a favour do me. But faith I may not, nor I cannot hold: To keep in all their vanities untold, At least one humorous trick I must not misse, Which lately I observ'd, and that was this; Two Lads of late disposed to be merry, Met at a town not far from Canturbury. Where though their businesse scarce would let them stay, They'd frolike out a night and then away. So there they supt and slept; where I let passe To tell their mirth in what good fashion 'twas: But as I heard, the parish-clock strook one Before their merry-mad-conceits were done: And then they went to bed, where I dare say They'd more devotion to go sleep than pray. Next morn th' one waking suddenly upstart, And lightly girt out such a boistrousâ It wak'd his fellow, who surpriz'd with wonder, Leapt up amaz'd, and swore he heard it thunder. Now whether storme there were or no, 'twas sed, The Chamberpot o're-flow'd and drown'd the bed. But, having pray'd a curse or two, th' one rises, Then of his businesse with himselfe devises, And thereupon doth like a carefull man, Sweare he will thence with all the speed he can. Come prethee rise (quoth he) and let's be gon, Yes, yes (quoth th' other) I will come anon. Zounds hark, I think the clock striks eight. Why when! Oh, soon enough to break my fast by ten. Then Chamberlain, one call's aloud, do'st heare, Come, bring us up a double-jug of Beer. So either having drunk a good carouse, Down come the Gallants to discharge the house. But taking leave, oh, what d'ye think they mist Their Hostesse (pretty woman) must be kist. Then up shee's call'd, and in her night attire, Down claps she on a stoole before the fire; Where having bid her welcome from her nest, Come say (quoth one) what wine is't you like best? Truely (quoth she) I use to drink no wine, Yet your best mornings-draught is Muskadine. With that the Drawer's call'd to fill a quart, (Oh! 'tis a wholsome liquor next the heart.) And having drunk it whilst their heads were steady, They bad the Hostler make their horses ready: Nay (quoth the Hostesse) what needs all this hast? In faith you shall not go till dinner's past? I have a dish prepared for the nones, A rich Potato-Pie, and Marrow-bones; Yea, and a bit which Gallants, I protest I will not part with unto every guest. With that the Punics lay aside their cloaks, The glasses walk, and the Tobacco smoaks, Till dinner comes, with which when they are fraught To get on horse-back by and by 'tis naught, As having supp'd, 'tis good to walk a mile, So after dinner men must sit a while. But what? will they sit idle? 'twere a shame, Reach them the Tables, they must play a game, Yet, set them by again, for now I think They know not when to leave: they'll rather drink A health or two to some especiall friend, And then ifaith they mean to make an end. Then one calls, Drawer: he cries, What d'yee lack? Rogue, bring us up a Gallon more of Sack. When that's turn'd up, Zounds one wil drink no more But bids the Hostler bring his horse to dore: The fellow might perform it without stay, For why? they had been bridl'd up all day. Then like good husbands without any words, Again they buckled on their cloaks and swords; But stepping out of dore their Hostesse meets them, And with a full-fill'd boule demurely greets them. This was her Pinte, but they'll give her the tother, Which drew the third down, and the third another Vntill these Gallants felt their heads so addle, Their bodies scarce could sit upright i'th saddle. Then more to settle their unsteady brain, They fell to their Tobacco once again: At which they suck'd so long, they thought no more On the poore jades which they left ty'd at dore: Till that the Sunne declin'd unto the West. Then starting up, th' one swore he thought 'twere best That they went thence; and to his fellow said, Come, we shall be benighted I'me afraid. What if we be (quoth tother) by this light, I know the time when I have rid all night: By twelve a clock Il'e be at home, I vow, Yet Hostesse, by this kisse, I'le sup with you. And so they did; but after Supper th' one Hastens the other that they may be gone. Nay, be advised (quoth his copesmate) harke, Let's stay all night, for it grows pestlence dark. I marry (quoth the Host) perswaded be, There's many murthers now, I promise yee. Ile bid my servants to shut up the gate, No guests shall go out of my house so late. No surely (quoth their Hostesse) by Saint Anne You may be mischieft; stay and save a man. Well, they'l be rul'd for once; but sweare they'l go The following morning ere the Cock do crow: In troth at farthest, e're the day gives light. Then, having kist their Hostesse over-night, To bed againe these roystring Youngsters went, Forgetting whereto they before were bent. But when the Morn her turne again did take, And that it grew high time for them to wake; Then up they bustled, and began to lay The fault from one th' other of their stay. For this (the first said) we may thank your sloth; (But I think therein they were guilty both) Nay (quoth the other) might you have your will, You'd drink Tabrcco and be quaffing still. Who I (quoth he) I weigh it not two chips: I could not get you from my Hostesse lips. You do me wrong (saith th' other) for I sweare I seldome touch'd them: but you still hung there. To beare the burthen he grew discontent, And swore he would not drink before he went. But call'd; Our horses Ostler, and our wands, And, Sirrah Tapster, water for our hands. Yet (quoth the other) thou'lt be rul'd I think, Prethee let m'intreat thee now to drink Before thou wash; Our fathers that were wise, Were wont to say, 'Twas wholesome for the eyes. Well; if he drink, a draught shall be the most, That must be spiced with a nut-brown tost. And then 'twere good they had a bit beside, For they considered they had far to ride. So he that would not drink a-late for haste, Is now content to stay and break his fast. Which e'er 'twere ended, up their Host was got; And then the Drunkard needs must have his pot, And so he had: but I commend my Cozen, The Cuckolds one Can, cost the fools a dozen. But then perceiving they began to stay, Quoth Guts, My Bullies, bark ye, what d'yee say Can you this morning on a rasher feed? Oh, yes, say they, that's kingly meat indeed. They ask'd it, and they had it, but this cheere Quickly drew down a dozen more of Beere: Which being drunk they had got out of towne, But that their Hostesse newly was come down; With whom they spent e'er they could get away, In kissing and in quaffing halfe that day. And five times, as I heard, they took the pain To get on horseback, and come off again. But at the last, just as the clock strooke two, They were the sixt time horst with much adoe. But then (as 'tis the Drunkards use) they sate Tipling some hower and a halfe at gate: So that the night drew on apace, and then Thither came riding other Gentlemen, And ment to lodge there. They had friendship shown, Th' other were stale guests, and their money flown: Their honest Host for all their large expence, And former kindenesse quickly got him thence. Yea, their sweet Hostesse that so worthy deem'd them Slunk out of sight, as if she nought esteem'd them. And as most will that meet with such a crew, Left them old Guls, to enterleague with new; Who at their parting purpos'd to have kist her, But were so drunken that they never mist her. For there they quaft so long they did not know Which way, nor whither, nor yet when to go; That some suppose, yea, and they think so still, Their horses brought them thence against their will. For, if so be their beasts had wanted wit To come themselves, the fools had been there yet. If you 'twas made by read with discontent, You are too blame; none knows by wh? twas meant: There is no cause you should dislike my rime, That learns you wit against another time. When others are thus vain, could you forbeare it, And note the follies in't, you would forsweare it, And so that those who thus you entertain, Will flout and use the next as well for gain, Now what do you unto these Gallants say? Were they not pretty witty ones, I pray? It may be they will frown at this to see't, And I am very sorry for't: but yet One humour more which I have noted vain, Here to be told of they must not disdain. It may annoy them if they do not mend it, Yea notwithstanding they so much defend it. 'Tis this; They too much of their valour vaunt, And so extreamly for vain-glory haunt, That to procure themselves a valiant name, Or peradventure one halfe houres fame, They'l hazard life and limb, yea, soule and all, Rather than in their bravery they'l let fall A vain repute. Oh silly senselesse men! What will the breath of fame availe you, when You lie in dust, and moulded up in clay? Perhaps you shall be spoken of a day In some poore Village where your bodies lie: To all the earth besides your fame shall die. And it may be whereas you look for glorie, You shall but serve to make more long the story Of hair-brain'd fools; &amp; such (how e'er some deem you Men that have understanding will esteem you. But yet there is a crew that much annoyes The Common-weal, some call them Roaring-boyes London doth harbour many at this time, And now I think their Order's in the prime And flourishing estate. Divers are proud To bee of that base brotherhood allow'd. And reason too: For why? they are indeed No common fellows, for they all exceed: They do so, but in what things are they think ye? In villany, for these be they will drink ye, From morn till night, from night till morn again, Emptying themselves like Conduits, and remain Ready for more still. Earth drinks not the showers Faster than their infernall throats devours Wine and strong liquors. These be they will sweare As if they would the veile of heaven teare, And compell God to heare their blasphemy. These are the Patrons of all villany; Whores Champions: deceit and trecherie, With the most lothsome vice of lechery Is all their practice. Thunder when it roars, Ioyn'd with the raging waves that beat the shoars Together with the windes most rude intrusion, Make not a noyse more full of mad confusion Than do these Hell-hounds where they use to house, And make their most uncivill Rendevouze: For a more godlesse crew there cannot well Be pick'd out of the boundlesse pit of Hell. Yet these base slaves (whose lewdnesse I confesse I cannot finde words able to expresse) Are Great-mens darlings; (as some understand) The absolutest Gallants in this land, And onely men of Spirit of our time; But this opinion's but a vulgar crime; For they which understanding have, see plain, That these, and all their favourites are vain: And sure 'twere good if such were forc'd to give A strict account by whom and how they live. Thus have I brought to light as well's I can Some of the vanities I finde in Man. But I do feare in taking so much pain, I have but shown my selfe to be most vain; Because I have spent time and reprehended That which will ne'er the sooner be amended, But yet there's hope it may; and therefore I Say thus much more, that this foule Vanitie Consisteth not alone in words and works, It hath tane root within, and also lurks About the heart: and if it there be sought, I know it also may be found in thought. And that is it makes one man sit and plot What is by trasticke with Virginia got: What it may cost to furnish him a Fleet That shall with all the Spanish Navy meet; Or how he may by art or practice finde A nearer passage to the Eastern-Inde, When as perhaps (poore foole) besides his coat, He is not worth a Portsmouth passage boat: Nor never means to travell so much Sea, As from Hith-ferry to South-hampton-key. Another Woodcock is as fondly vain, And to no purpose doth molest his brain, To study if he were a Nobleman, What kinde of cariage would befit him then. How, and in what set words he would complain Of the Abuses that he now sees reigne: Where he would make his place of residence, How he would keep his house with providence, And yet what plenty daily at his doore Should be distributed unto the poore. What certain sheep and oxen should be slain, And what provision weekly to maintain His Lordly port. How many Servingmen He meant to keep; and peradventure then What pleasure he wil have, what hawks, what hounds What game he will preserve about his grounds. Or else he falls to cast what profits cleare His gifts and bribes will come to in a yeare; How hee'l put off his hat, cause people then Shall say, he is a courteous Nobleman. Then upon this again he falls to plot, How when that he the peoples love hath got, If that the King and all his kindred die, And if none may be found that will supply The Regall office, the respect they beare him Vnto that Princely dignity may reare him. Then doth his thoughts on that estate so feed, That he forgetteth what he is indeed. And if a man could hit so just a time, To come upon him when his thought's in prime, And give him unawares a sudden knock, Conceit his understanding so would lock, That I suppose (because it stands with reason) He would go neare to start, and call out Treason: For oftentimes mens hearts are so annoy'd With those vain thoughts wheron they are imploy'd, That for a time they so forgetfull grow, As what they are or where they do not know. But now, sith you may see there doth remain Nothing in man but in some sort is vain; And sith I must be driven to confesse, His vanities are great and numberlesse, Ile go no farther in this large Survay, For feare discourse should carry me away: And peradventure so I may become Lesse pleasing and more tedious unto some. Which to avoid, though I no end espie, Yet here I end to treat of Vanity. Of Inconstancie. Satyre 2. Yet there's another propertie in Men That means to set my Muse to work agen, Inconstancie: and that no other is, (Vnlesse I understand the same amisse) But an unsetled humour of the minde, Which so unstable is, it cannot finde By any study that Opinion Which long it dares to be resolved on: 'Tis meere irresolution, and estranging From what is purpos'd by a fickle changing, But sith this vice I threaten to detect, Women I know will earnestly expect To be sore rail'd on. But Ile gently use them, Because I see their consciences accuse them, And notwithstanding they deserve much blame, Yet I'le not speak of ought unto their shame. So they will think I mean them also, when I treat of the inconstancie of Men: And though their faults I seem not to upbraid, 'Cause nothing is directly of them said, Yet they I hope will ne'er the more disdain To be thought fickle, proud, and weak, and vain. But now for Man; whereas I did complain, He both in Deed, and Word, and Thought was vain So I in this (I see) the like may doe, Sith he in all these is inconstant too. It is a wondrous thing me thinks to see How variable all his actions be; He labours now, and's altogether set Vpon the world, how he much wealth may get; Vpon a sudden (then he thinks to mend it) Hee's in an humour and a course to spend it: Sometime he is consenting with the Devill, And ready to doe any act that's evill. Which he (perhaps) repenting, some divine Or heavenly matter doth his thoughts refine, So that he is resolv'd to spend that day In reading what Gods holy Prophets say; Which in his minde it may be worketh so, He leaves it and will to a Sermon go; But by the way a Bill he doth espie, Which shews there's acted some new Comedy; Then thither he is full and wholly bent, There's nothing that shall hinder his intent. But e'er he to the Theater can come, He heares perhaps the sounding of a Drum; Thereat he leaves both Stage-play and Devotion, And will (forsooth) go see some idle motion. E'er hee gets in his rowling wandring eyes Behold some Fencer prest to play his prize, Faith, then there is no remedy hee'll see't. But e'er he can get halfe-way o'er the street, Some very neare acquaintance doth salute him, Who for a miser would perhaps repute him, Vnlesse he kindely offer to bestow The wine, or Beere at least, before he goe: Well then, he will; but while they do devise What Wine to have, perhaps they heare the cries And howling which the eager Mastiffes make, When they behold a Bull or Beare at stake; Oh, on a sudden then they will be gone, They'l see that first, and come and drink anon. But just as he out of the Taverne peeps, Some gallant Lasse along before him sweeps; Whose youthfull brow adorn'd with beauty trim, And lovely making doth so ravish him, That as if he were bound her to attend, He leaves Play, Fencer, Wine, Bull, Dogs, and Friend. By which we see his minde is alwaies varying, And seldome constant on one object tarrying. But still that thing with most desire is sought, Which is presented last unto his thought. One while he likes best of the Country-sport, Anon prefers the pleasure of the Court. Another his mind's travelling to Spain, Then unto France, and hither straight again. Now he thinks highly of a single life, And hates the marriage bed, as full of strife: And yet e'en in the turning of a hand, Hee's glad to make a joynture of his land, And woo with much entreaty to obtain That wife which he did but of late disdain. One while he zealously professeth Christ, Another while becomes an Atheist. In Turkey he will Mahomet adore, Among the cursed Pagans can implore A Carved stone; in Rome he hath profest The worship of the Antichristian beast; And yet in England here with us he grants No sound Religion but the Protestants. And not alone according to the place, Can these Camelions alter thus their case; But for a shift themselves they do apply, To answer both the Time and Company. Gallants shall finde them formall, Youngmen wilde, Plain-men shall think them simple, Old-men milde. And for the time with Edward they will be (Ile warrant) Protestants as well as he. And when his Sister Mary comes to reigne, They can be Papists easily again. Nay, I do feare me, though we have had teaching, And almost threescore yeares the Gospels preaching. (Vnconstant mankinde is so prone to ill, And to be changing hath so good a will) Too many both of old men and of youth, Might soon be drawn for lies to leave the truth. Lets note it, and it will be strange to see What contradictions in our actions be: Sometime that man we doe with Trophies raise Whom we did but a while before dispraise: Nor can we alway in one Passion keep, But often for one thing rejoyce and weep. Is't not a signe of humane ficklenesse, And a true note of our unsetlednesse, When not alone some one, or two, or few, But a great number, a selected Crew, Pick'd out of all estates, and they the wisest, The understanding'st, yea, and the precisest Of a whole Empire, that when these (I say) Have argued pro &amp; con from day to day, From week to week, to have (perhaps) enacted One Law or Statute, yet when all's compacted, And every thing seems clearly done and ended, Then to have something in't to be amended? Yea, and when this is done, and the Records Fram'd in the plain'st and most effectuall words, T'expresse their meaning, and they think it plain; Yet at next reading 'tis dislik'd again? This yeare they make a law, repeal't the next, Then re-inact it, and then change the text; Either by taking from, or adding to, And so they have an endlesse work to doe. But some may tell me that thus stands the case, They must have both respect to time and place, And that no Law devis'd by humane wit, Can be for ev'ry place and season fit. All which I yeeld for truth indeed, but then Wee must confesse a misery in men, That they (Camelion-like) must have a minde, With every object unto change inclin'd. I might speak of the changes which I see In mens externall fortunes also be: For this day he hath friends, to morrow none: Now he hath wealth, and in an houre 'tis gone. Some in their youth there be have all things store, And yet do often live till they are poore. Again, there's some in youth at beggers states, Become in age to be great Potentates. Some are of Kings made slaves, and Kings again, Whilst others with the contrary complain. For poore Eumenes, of a Potters sonne, By fickle Fortunes help a kingdome won; Who for him such a diet did provide, That shortly after he of hunger dy'd, I many such examples might infer, But that would waste more time and make me erre From my intent, who purpose to relate, The ficklenesse of Man, not his estate. Moreover, hee's a creature knows not how To do an act which he shall long allow, Or well himselfe approve. He cannot tell What he would have, nor what he would not, well. For peradventure he is now content To doe what he will in an houre repent. He does and undoes what he did before, Is discontented, and with no man more Than with himselfe. In word hee's fickle too, For he will promise what hee'll never doe. If that he tell me he will be in Pauls, Ile go look for him in the Temple-Halls; For soonest to that place resort doth hee, Whereas he saies or sweares he will not be. Oh! had there been in words a constant trust, I needed not t'have done as now I must; I should have had no cause to have bewail'd That which I once thought would have never fail'd: But sith 'tis thus, at nothing more I grieve, Than that unconstant words made me beleeve. Were promises worth trust, what needed then Such written contracts between Man and Man? And wherefore should they make so much adoe To have hands, seales, and witnesse thereunto? Vnlesse it be for proofes to make it plain, Their words are both inconstant, false, and vain. To morrow he will earnestly gain-say What stoutly is affirm'd by him to day: Yea, truely hee's so wavering and unjust, That scarce a word of his deserveth trust, But as a creature of all good forlorn, Sweares what's deny'd, and straight denies what's sworn. That I suppose himselfe he doth but mock, And is more changing than a Weather-cock. For e'en the thought that's likliest to remain, Another that's unlike puts out again. Meer appetite (not reason) guides him still, Which makes him so inconstant in his will. Had he a suit at first made but of leather, And cloathes enough to keep away the weather, 'Twere all his wish; well, so much let us grant, And ten to one he something else will want; But swears that he for more would never care, Than to be able to have cloth to weare; Which if he get, then would he very fain Reach to have silks, for cloath he thinks too plain; And so his wishes seldome would have stay, Vntill that he hath wish'd for all he may. But though from this infirmity there's no man That I can well except, it is so common; Yet surely I most properly may cal't, Or tearm't to be the common peoples fault. Think not I wrong them, for if it may not be A fault so to digresse, you soon should see Their nature and condition; but I hate it: And here in this place I will now relate it. Let therefore none condemne me if I break My course awhile; for I of them will speak; Something, I say, my Muse of them must tell, She cannot beare it any farther well. And yet expect not all, for Ile but shew Of many hundred-thousand-faults a few. And to be briefe: The vulgar are as rude, A strange-inconstant-hare-braind multitude: Born to and fro with every idle Passion; And by Opinion led beside all fashion. For novelty they hunt, and to a Song, Or idle tale they'l listen all day long. Good things soon tyre them, and they ever try To all reports how they may adde a lie, Like that of Scoggins Crows: and with them still Custome hath born most sway, and ever will. Or good or bad what their forefathers do, They are resolv'd to put in practise too. They are seditious, and so given to range In their opinions, that they thirst for change. For if their Countrey be turmoyl'd with war, They think that peace is more commodious farre. If they be quiet, they would very fain Begin to set the warres abroach again. I well remember when an Irish Presse Had made a Parish but a man the lesse, Lord, what a hurly-burly there was then! These warres (say they) hath cost us many a man, The Countrey is impoverish'd by't, and we Rob'd of our husbands and our children be; With many sad complainings: But now peace Hath made Bellona's bloudy anger cease, Their ever-discontented natures grutch, And think this happy peace we have, too much, Yea, and their wisedomes beares us now in hand, That it is war that doth enrich the land. But what are these? not men of any merit, That speak it from a bold and daring spirit, But lightly some faint-hearted braving Momes That rather had be hang'd at their own homes Than for the welfare of their Countrey stay The brunt of one pitch'd-battell but a day: Or such as would distraught with feare become, To heare the thundring of a martiall Drum. They cannot keep a mean (a naughty crime) Nor never are contented with the time; But better like the state they have been in, Although the present hath the better bin. E'en as the Iews that loathing Manna fain Would be in Ãgypt at their flesh again, Though they were there in bondage. So do these Wish for the world as in Queen Maries dayes, With all the blindnesse and the trumpery That was expel'd the Land with Popery. Why? things were cheap, and 'twas a goodly meny When we had foure and twenty egges a penny: But sure they ate them stale for want of wit, And that hath made them addle-headed yet. Then this (moreover) I have in them seen, They alwaies to the good have envious been. Milde men they reckon fools, and do uphold Him to be valiant that is over-bold: When he with wisemen is and ever was Counted no better than a desperate Asse. He that doth trust unto their love shall finde 'Tis more unconstant than the wavering winde: Which since my time a man that many knew, Relying on it, at his death found true. Then they have oft unthankfully withstood Those that have labour'd for the Common good. And, being basely minded, evermore Seek lesse the publike than the private store. Moreover, such a Prince as yet was never, Of whom the people could speak well of ever. Nor can a man a Governour invent them, How good soever that should long content them. Their honesty as I do plainly finde, Is not the disposition of their minde; But they are forc'd unto the same through feare: As in those villaines it may well appeare, Who having found some vile ungodly cause, If there be any means to wrest the Laws By tricks or shifts to make the matter go As they would have it, all is well enough: Although the wrong and injury they proffer, Be too apparant for a Iew to offer. They know not Iustice; and oft causelesse hate: Or where they should not, are compassionate. As at an Execution I have seene, Where malefactors have rewarded beene, According to desert; before they know, If the accused guilty be or no: They on report, this hasty censure give; He is a villaine, and unfit to live: But when that he is once arraign'd and found Guilty by law, and worthily led bound Vnto the Scaffold, then they doe relent And pitty his deserved punishment. Those that will now brave gallant men be deem'd, And with the common people be esteem'd, Let them turne Hacksters as they walke the street, Quarrell and fight with every one they meet, Learne a Welsh song to scoffe the British bloud, Or breake a jest on Scotchmen that's as good: Or if they would that fools should highly prize them, They should be Iugglers if I might advise them: But if they want such feats to make them glorious, By making Ballads they shall grow notorious. Yet this is nothing, if they looke for fame, And meane to have an everlasting name Amongst the Vulgar, let them seeke for gaine With Ward the Pirat, on the boisterous Maine; Or else well-mounted keepe themselves on land, And bid our wealthy Travellers to stand Emptying their full-cram'd-bags: for they'l not stick To speake in honour still of Cutting-dick. But some may tell me, though that it be such, It doth not goe against their conscience much: And though there's boldnesse showne in such a case, Yet Tyburne is a scurvy dying-place: No, 'tis their credit; for the people then, Will say, 'Tis pitty, they were proper men, And with a thousand such like humors naught, I doe perceive the common-people fraught. Then by the opinion of some it seemes, How much the Vulgar sort of men esteemes Of Art and Learning. Certaine neighbouring swaines (That think none wise men but whose wisdome gains Where knowledge be it morall or divine, Is valued as an Orient Pearle with Swine) Meeting me in an Evening in my walke. Being gone past me, thus began to talke: First an old Chuffe whose roofe I dare be bold, Hath Bacon hangs in't above five yeeres old, Said, that's his sonne that's owner of the grounds That on these pleasant Beechy Mountaine bounds; D'ye marke me neighbours? This same yong mans vather (Had a bin my zon, chad a hang'd him rather) Assoone as he perceiv'd the little voole Could creepe about the house, putten to schoole: Whither he went not now and then a spurt, As't had been good to keepe him from the durt; Nor yet at leasure times (that's my zonnes stint) Vor then indeed there had bin reason in't. But for continuance, and beyond all zesse A held him too 't six daies a weeke no lesse; That, by S. Anne, it was a great presumption It brought him not his end with a consumption. And then besides he was not so content, To putten there whereas our childers went, (To learne the Horne-book and the Abcce through) No that he thought not learning halfe enough, But we must seeke the Country all about, Where he might finde a better teacher out. And then he buyes him (now a pips befall it) A vlapping booke: (I know not what they call it) 'Tis Latine all; and thus begins: In speech, And that's in English, Boy, beware your breech. One day my Dick a leafe on't with him brought, (Which he out of his fellowes booke had raught) And to his mother and my selfe did reade it: But we indeed did so extreamely dread it, We gave him charge no more thereon to looke, Vor veare it had beene of a conjuring booke. But if you thinke I jest, goe aske my Wife, If ere she heard such gibberish in her life. But when he yong had cond the same by heart, And of a meny moe the better part; He went to Oxford, where he did remaine Some certaine yeeres, whence hee's return'd again. Now who can tell (it in my stomacke sticks) And I doe veare he hath some Oxford tricks But if't be zo, would he had ne'er come hither, Vor we shall still be sure of blustering weather. To what end else is all his vathers cost? Th' ones charges, and the tothers labour's lost. I warrant he so long a learning went, That he almost a brothers portion spent; And now it nought availes him: By this Holly I thinke all learning in the world a folly, And them I take to be the veriest vooles, That all their lifetime doe frequent the Schooles. Goe aske him now, and see if all his wits Can tell you when a Barley season hits; When Meddowes must be left to spring, when mown, When Wheat, or Tarcs, or Rye, or Pease be sown: He knowes it not; nor when 'tis meet to fold, How to manure the ground that's wet and cold: What Lands are fit for Pasture, what for Corne, Or how to hearten what is over-worne. Nay he scarce knowes a Gelding from a Mare, A Barrow from a Sow, nor takes he care Of such like things as these. He knowes not whether There be a difference twixt the Ewe and Wether. Can he resolve you (No, nor many more) If Cowes doe want their upper teeth before? Nay, I durst pawne a groat he cannot tell How many legs a Sheepe hath very well. Is't not a wiseman thinke yee? By the Masse Cham glad at heart my zonne's not zuch an asse: Why he can tell already all this geare, As well almost as any of us here. And neighbours, yet I'l tell you more; my Dick Hath very pretty skill in Arsemetrick: Can cast account, write's name, and Dunces daughter Tought him to spell the hardest words ith Zauter, And yet the Boy I'l warrant you knowes how As well as you or I, to hold the Plow: And this I noted in the V'rchen ever, Bid him to take a booke he had as lether All day have drawne a Harrow; truth is so, I like'd it well although I made no show; For to my comfort I did plainely see, That he hereafter would not bookish be. Then when that having nought at home to doe, I sometime forc'd him to the Schoole to goe, You would have griev'd in heart to heare him whine; And then how glad he was to keepe the swine, I yet remember, and what tricks the Mome Would have invented to but stay at home, You would have wondred. But 'tis such another, A has a wit for all the world like's Mother. Yet once a moneth although it grieves him then, Hee'l looke you in a book doe what ye can: That Mother, Sister, Brother, all we foure Can scarce perswade him from't in halfe an houre. But oft I thinke he does it more of spight To anger us, than any true delight: Vor why? his Mother thinks as others doe, (And I am halfe of that opinion too) Although a little learning be not bad, Those that are bookish are the soonest mad. And therefore, sith much wit makes vooles of many, Chill take an order, mine shall ne'er have any. Byr Lady, you'r the wiser (quoth the rest) The course you take in our conceit's the best: Your zonne may live in any place i'th land By his industrious and laborious hand; Whilst he (but that his Parents are his stay) Hath not the meanes to keepe himselfe a day. His study to our sight no pleasure gives, Nor meanes, nor profit, and thereby he lives So little thing the better, none needs doubt it, He might have beene a happier man without it: For though he now can speake a little better, It is not words you know will free the debter. Thus some, whose speeches shew well what they be For want of matter fell to talke of me: Of whom, though something they have said be true, Yet sith in stead of giving Art her due, They have disgrac'd it. Notwithstanding, I Have not the knowledge that these Dolts envy, Or can so much without incurring blame, As take unto my selfe a Schollers name: Yet now my reputation here to save, (Sith I must make account of what I have) Ile let you know though they so lightly deeme it, What gaine's in knowledge, and how I esteeme it. As often as I call to minde the blisse, That in my little knowledge heaped is; The many comforts, of all which the least More joyes my heart than can be well exprest: How happy then thinke I, are they whose soules More wisedome by a thousand part inroules; Whose understanding hearts are so divine, They can perceive a million more than mine? Such have content indeed. And who that's Man, And should know reason, is so senselesse then To spurne at Knowledge, Art or Learning, when That onely showes they are the race of Men? And what may I then of these peasants deeme, Which doe of wisedome make so small esteeme; But that, indeed, such blockish, senselesse logs, Sprang from those Clownes Latona turn'd to frogs: Alas! Suppose they nothing can be got By precious stones, 'cause Swine esteeme them not? Or doe they thinke because they cannot use it, That those that may have Knowledge, will refuse it? Well, if their shallow coxcombes can containe A reason when 'tis told them; I'l explaine How that same little knowledge I have got, Much pleasures me (though they perceive it not,) For first thereby, though none can here attaine For to renew their first estate againe, A part revives (although it be but small) Of that I lost by my first Fathers fall. And makes me man; which was before (at least) As haplesse, if not more, than is the beast, That reason wants: for his condition still, Remaines according to his Makers will. They never dreame of that. And then by this, I finde what godly and what evill is: That knowing both, I may the best ensue; And as I ought, the worser part eschew. Then I have learn'd to count that drosse but vaine, For which such Boores consume themselves with pain I can endure all discontentments, crosses, Be Ioviall in my want and smile at losses; Keepe under Passions, stop those insurrections, Rais'd in my Microcosmus by affections, Be nothing grieved for adversity, Nor ne'er the prouder for prosperity. How to respect my Friends I partly know, And in like manner how to use my Foe. I can see others lay their Soules to pawne, Looke upon Great-men, and yet scorne to fawne; Am still content; and dare whilst God gives grace, E'en looke my grimmest fortunes in the face. I feare mens censures as the char-coale sparks, Or as I doe a toothlesse Dog that barks; The one frights children, th' other threats to burne; But sparkes will die, and brawling Curres returne. Yea, I have learn'd that still my care shall be A rush for him that cares a straw for me. Now what would men have more? Are these no pleasures; Or doe they not deserve the name of treasures? Sure yes; and he that hath good learning store, Shall finde these in't, besides a thousand more. O! but our Chuffs thinke these delights but course, If we compare them to their Hobby-horse: And they beleeve not any pleasure can Make them so merry as Maid-marian. Nor is the Lawyer prouder of his fee, Than these will of a Cuckooe Lordship be: Though their sweet Ladies make them father that Some other at their Whilson-Ales begat. But he whose carriage is of so good note, To be thought worthy of their lords fooles coat, That's a great credit; for because that he Is ever thought the wisest man to be. But, as there's vertue where the Divel's precisest, So ther's much knowledge where a foole's the wisest But what meane I? let earth content these Moles, And their high'st pleasure be their Summer-poles; Round which I leave their Masterships to dance, And much good doe't them, with their ignorance. So this I hope will well enough declare How rude these vulgar sort of people are. But here upon there's some may question make, Whether I onely for the vulgar take Such men as these. To whom I answer, no; For let them hereby understand and know, I doe not meane these meaner sort alone Tradesmen or Labourers; but every one, Be he Esquire, Knight, Baron, Earle, or more, For if he have not learn'd of Vertues lore, But followes vulgar Passions; then e'en he, Amongst the vulgar shall for one man be And that poore Groom whom he thinks shold adore him, Shall for his vertue be preferr'd before him: For though the world doe such men much despise, They seeme most noble in a wise-mans eies. And notwithstanding some doe noblest deeme Such as are sprung of great and high esteeme, And those to whom the Country doth afford The title of a Marquesse or a Lord, Though 'twere atchieved by their fathers merit, And they themselves men of a dunghill spirit; Cowards or fooles, (and such as ever be Prating or boasting of their pedegree) When they are nothing but a blot or shame, Vnto the noble house from whence they came: Yet these (I say) unlesse that they have wit, To guide the Common-wealth, as it is fit They should; and as their good fore-fathers did How ere their faults may seeme by greatnesse hid, They shall appeare; and that poore Yeomans sonne, Whose proper vertue hath true honour wonne; Preferred be; for though Nobility That comes by birth hath most antiquity; And though the greater sort, befooled shall, That new enobled man, an upstart call, Yet, him most honour I, whose noblenesse By vertue comes; yea such mens worthinesse Most ancient is. For that is just the same, By which all Great-men first obtain'd their fame. I therefore hope 'twill not offend the Court, That I count some therewith the Vulgar sort, And outset others though men thinke me bold, That this opinion I presume to hold. But shall I care what others thinke or say? There is a path besides the beaten way; Yea and a safer. For here's Christs instruction, The broadest way leads soonest to Destruction. And truly no opinions deceive Sooner than those the Vulgar sort receive: And therefore, he that would indeed be wise, Must learne their rude conditions to despise, And shun their presence; for we have beene taught, Diseases in a presse are quickly caught. Now Satyr, leave them till another time, And spare to scourge the Vulgar with thy Rime: If any thinke thou hast digrest too long, They may passe over this, and doe no wrong. But in my former matter to proceed; Who (being of mans Race) is so much freed From ficklenesse, that he is sure to find Himselfe to morrow in that very mind Hee's in to day? though he not onely know No reason wherefore he should not be so, But also though he plainly doe perceive Much cause he should not that opinion leave. If no man finde it so, who justly can Be forced to relye, or trust in Man; Whose thoughts are changing, and so oft amisse, That by himselfe, himselfe deceived is: Who is so sottish as to build Salvation On such a feeble tottering foundation As Man? Who is't that having a respect To his soules safety, will so much neglect That precious assurance, as to lay His confidence on that false peece of clay, Which being fickle, merits farre lesse trust, Than letters written in the sand or dust: Doe they not see those they have soundest deem'd, And for their constantst Writers long esteem'd, All wavering in assertions? yea, but looke, And you shall finde in one and the same booke, Such contradiction in opinion, As shewes their thoughts are scarce at union. Where finde you him that dares be absolute, Or alwaies in his sayings resolute? There's none; I by mine owne experience speake, Who have a feeling that we men are weake: Whereon much musing makes me inly mourne, And grieve almost that I a man was borne. (Yet hereupon I doe desire that no man, Would gather that I long to be a woman.) Alas! how often had I good intendments And with my whol hart vow'd &amp; swore amendments; Yea purpos'd that, wherein I once thought never Ynconstancy should let me to persever? And yet for all my purpose and my vow, I am oft altered ere my selfe knowes how. But therefore, sith it is not I alone, Or any certaine number that is knowne, To be unstable, but e'en all that be; Sith none (I say) is from this frailty free, Let us confesse it all, and all implore Our nere-repenting God that evermore Remaines the same, we may be (as we ought) More certaine both in word and deed and thought: That he will keepe us from Inconstancie, Yea, from all damned, lewd Apostacie; And howsoever our affections change And we in slight opinions hap to range; Yet, pray his Truth in us be so ingraved, That biding to the end we may be saved. Of Weaknesse. Satyr. 3. Bvt, oh looke here; for I have surely found The maine chiefe roote, the very spring &amp; ground Of our Inconstancie It is not chance That so disables our perseverance; But a base Weakenesse: which to tearme aright, Is meerely a privation of our might, Or a detraction from that little power Which should be in those limbs and mindes of our. We boast of strength; but tell me, can our daies Afford a Milo, or a Hercules? Can all the world (and that is large enough) A match for Hector or Achilles show? Have we a Champion strong enough to wield. His Buckler? or Sir Aiax seven-fold Shield? I thinke we have not: (but I durst so grant, There be some living shall with Ajax vaunt.) Nay, now in these daies it is doubted much, Whether that any former age had such As these fore-nam'd; but indeed our faith Binds us to credit, that as Scripture saith; There was a Sampson, who could fright whole hosts And rent downe Gaza's barred gates and posts, Whose mighty Armes unarm'd could bring to passe E'en with a rotten Iaw-bone of an Asse, A thousands ruine; and yet 'twill be long Ere he shall thereby proove that man is strong. For first, the strength he seem'd to have was known To be the Spirit of God, and not his own: And then his proper weaknesse did appeare, When after his brave act he had wel-neare Beene dead for thirst, whereas if he in spight Of Nature had beene able, by his might Out of that little Bony-rocke to wring, To quench his present thirst, some flowing spring, As did a stronger one: or if his power Could have compel'd the melting clouds to showre For present need such plenteous drops of raine He might have had no reason to complaine, Or crave more aide; Sure then we might at length, Suppose that men had in themselves a strength, But ne'r till then. Hee's mighty that can make The Heavens, Earth and Hell, with's breath to shake That in his Spheare the Suns swift course can stop, And Atlas with his burthen under-prop, He that with ease this Massie Globe can rowle, And wrap up heaven like a parchment scrowle; He that for no disease nor paine will droope, Nor unto any plague infernall stoope: He that can meate and drinke and sleepe refraine, O hath the power to die and rise againe; Hee's strong indeed; but he that can but teare O, rend in two a Lion or a Beare, O, doe some such like act, and then goe lie Himselfe ore-come by some infirmitie, How ere with vaunts he seemes his deeds to grace, He is both miserable, weake and base. What creature is there borne so weake as Man, And so unable? tell me be that can. Or (if that they could numbred be by any) Count his diseases, and what hath so many? Or else what creature is there, if he be In bone and flesh of the same quantity, So fraile as Man? or that can worse sustaine Hunger, or thirst, or cold, or heate, or paine? Sure none; and yet in Histories we find, Till Luxury had weakned thus mankind, They were much stronger; could endure the heat, Travell a long time without drinke or meat: And their best dainty was no costlier thing, Than a wilde roote, or water from the spring. With which small commons Nature was content; Yea, in our climate people naked went; And yet no question felt as little cold, As we wrapt up in halfe a dozen fold. They had no wast-coats; night-caps for their heads, Nor downy pillowes, nor soft feather-beds: They scornd as much to have such things about them As we in this Age scorne to be without them. Their heads some stone bare up: their brawny sides, With ease the hardnesse of the earth abides. Gluttonous fare that so the palate pleases, Nere fild their bodies full of foule diseases; Nor any pleasing liquors with excesse, Made them grow weak through beastly drunkennesse No lust-provoking meats made them unchaste, Nor unto carnall copulation haste. For I am in the mind they ne'er requir'd it, Till Nature, come to her full strength desir'd it: And that is it alone which made them be More stout, more strong, and braver men than we: It was a noble care in them indeed. But how Are we become such Dwarfes and Pigmies now? How are our limbs so weake and feeble growne? I think I need not tell it, 'tis well knowne; Nice tender breeding, which we well might spare, Much drunkennesse and our luxurious fare? Which addes not strength, as some doe vainely say, But rather takes both strength and health away. Yet chiefly this same imbecility. Comes by too soon and frequent venery. A beardlesse boy now cannot keepe his bed, Vnlesse that he be of his night-geere sped, And many Giglets I have married seene, Ere they (forsooth) could reach eleventeene. Nay 'tis no wonder we are growne so weake, For now they'r matching brats ere they can speake: And though we yet say that the men are stronger, Yet he (I thinke) that lives but so much longer, The revolution of an Age to see, Will say that men the weaker vessels be. But now our strength of body, which indeed, Deserves no more respect than doth a Reed, Is not the strength of which I meant to speake, For we are yet another way too weake. Our minds have lost their Magnanimity, And are so feeble through infirmity; That either to be resolute we care not, Or else because of some base feare we dare not. Where can we almost finde a man so hardy, Who through his weakenesse is not sometime tardy To speake the truth? or to declare his minde, Though he doe many just occasions finde? Hee'l winke at's friends offence, and passe it blindly, Lest (peradventure) he should take't unkindly. And if it be a Great man that offends, Shew me but him that boldly reprehends, And I'l admire him. Nay, wee'l rather now Bend our endeavour, and our study how To sooth and fawne; or to their lewdnesse tell That all they doe (be't ne'er so bad) is well. Their very lookes and presence we so feare, As if that they some monstrous Cyclops were; Which makes them worse. But howsoere they trust Vnto their might, I'l tell them (for I must) Although they threaten and can slanders make Of just reproofes my heart shall never quake T'informe their Honors, thus 'tis censur'd by men, If they be Great ones, Tanto majus crimen: One knowes the truth, but dares not to defend it, Because he heares another discommend it; Yea divers follow Vertues waies but coldly, Because they dare not doe a good thing boldly: And doe we not perceive that many a man Fearing to be entituled, Puritan, Simply neglects the meanes of his salvation, Much hazarding thereby his soules damnation? Some cannot well endure this or that; Others distemper'd with I know not what, Shew an exceeding frailty: few can brooke With any patience that men should looke Into their actions; and though they should love them They rather hate them for't that doe reprove them. Is there a man so strong that he forbeares Choler or Envy, when by chance he heares Himselfe revil'd, reproached and disgrac'd? If there be such an one, he shall be plac'd Amongst the Worthies, with the formost three For in my judgement none more worthy be To have renowne for strength than those that can On their rebellious Passions play the man. This Weakenesse I doe also finde in men, They know not their owne happinesse till then When they have lost it: and they doe esteeme Men for their wealth and doe them blessed deeme That are most rich; supposing no man more Accursed or unhappy than the poore. Some basely do condemne each strange report To be untrue, because it doth not sort With their weake reasons. Some againe will be Astonished at every novelty: But too much wondering doth discover plaine, Where ignorance and frailty doth remaine. Is it not weakenesse, when some petty losses, Some hindrance in preferment, or such crosses, Shall make men grieve? Is it not weakenesse, when Adversity shall so disquiet men, That they should not with patience sustaine, Or under-goe a little crosse and paine? Yes, questionlesse it is; for were they strong, They would so arme themselves gainst grief &amp; wrong That no disastrous or ill hap should fright them, Though fortune did the worst she can to slight them: Nor would they those as the unworthiest deeme, To whom Dame Fortune doth most froward seeme; But rather such as all their lifetime be In quiet state, and from disturbance free: For she oft gives what their base longing craves, Because she scornes to vexe dejected slaves. I have knowne brave-men, brave at least in show (And in this Age now that is brave enow) That in appearance for brave Champions past, And yet have basely yeelded at the last. Besides, there's many who thought scorn to droope By Fortunes power, have beene made to stoope, And with discredit shamefully left undone What they with honour at the first begun: And their weake hearts (which frailty I much hate) Dejected, have growne base with their estate: Whereas (me thinks) the mind should never be Subject to Fortunes frownes nor tyranny. But here through weaknes some offence may take, That I of Fortune should recitall make: For they by Fortune say there's nothing done: But all things ars both ended and begun By Gods appointment. I confesse indeed That he knowes all, and all hath fore-decreed, In the respect of whom, I cannot say Ought comes by chance: respecting us, I may. So they are answer'd: but how can men be So over-borne with this infirmity: As those who are in every matter led By Parasites and Apes: Where is their head? I meane their will, their reason and their sense? What is become of their intelligence? How ist that they have such a partiall eare, They can judge nothing true, but what they heare Come from the tongue of some slie Sycophant: But for because they strength of judgement want? Those that themselves to flatteries inure, I have perceived basely to endure Too plainely to be soothed, mockt and flouted, Made coxcombs to their faces; yet not doubted That they were highly reverenc'd, respected, And by those fawning Parasites affected. And why forsooth? they often here them prate In commendation of their happy state: Yes, and they tell them that they vertuous be, Wise, courteous, strong, and beautifull to see: When if the eie of reason were not lockt, They plainely might perceive that they were mockt, For what is't else when they are prais'd for many Goodly conditions that had never any? This frailty also merits to be blam'd, When fearefull of reproach we are asham'd Our ignorance in those things to explain, Wherein 'twere fit more knowledge to attain. 'Tis weaknesse also when a bargaine's bought, Then to dispraise the penniworth, as nought, And tell what might have been, or fondly prate Of counsell when he sees it is too late. Nor is it any lesse to seeke to stay Him that we know doth hasten on his way; Or be importunate for that which will Be nothing for our good, yet others ill. Also to be affraid for to gain-say What men doe know untrue: or to delay The right of any matter to declare; Because they feare they unbeleeved are: For notwithstanding Truth doth oft bring blame, It may be freely spoken without shame. Divers more waies, of which I needs must speake, There's many men doe shew themselves but weake. In some but lately I observed this, And must needs say, their nature evill is: If friends to them have any kindnesse showne, Or entertainments willingly bestowne, That they confesse they are indebted for it: Yet such is their condition (I abhorre it) If then those friends do hap to take the pain: To come sometime and visite them again In meere good will, because these great ones see They cannot then so well provided be To bid them welcome as their loves require, (Though more than love, their loves did ne'er desire) A foolish shame so blinds them, that they shal (For giving them too much) have nought at all: Yea, for because they want excessive fare, Or some such things; for which their friends ne'er care (Though by their will it otherwise had beene) They neither will be knowne at home, nor seene: Which doth not onely shew impiety, But hindereth love, and barres societie. Yet now the greatest weakenesse that I finde To be in man, is ignorance of minde: It makes a poore man, hee's scarce good for ought; If rich men have it, they are worse than nought. For having riches store and wanting might Or strength of minde to use the same aright, 'Tis Arrogancies and Ambitions fuel, It makes them Covetous, Inconstant, Cruell, Intemperate, Vnjust and wondrous heady: Yea, in their actions rude, and so unsteady They cannot follow any sound direction But are still carried with a wild affection: This is their nature; (it is quickly noted) If they to honour be by hap promoted, Then they grow insolent beyond all reason, Apt for Ambition, Quarrels, Murthers, Treason, Or any villany that followes those Who doe the summe of happinesse repose In worldly glory. But if Fortune frowne, And from her fickle wheele once cast them downe; Then their dejected hearts againe grew base, They are impatient of their present case, Rave or run mad, and can doe nought poore Elves, Vnlesse it be goe hang or drowne themselves. Moreover, the same weakenesse that proceeds From ignorance this mischiefe also breeds; It makes men well conceited of their will, Which they will follow be it ne'er so ill: And they thinke all things needs must fall out bad Wherein their wise advise must not be had. But here's the hell; to them all counsell's vain, Cause they all others wisedome do disdain, And wholly on their own devises rest, As men perswaded that their owne are best. But, as all such are weake, e'en so I say Is every one that rashly doth repay Vengeance in anger: Or that's male-content Oft, or oft moved and impatient; Or those that judge of counsels by th' event; Or that perswade themselves, if their intent Be good and honest that it doth not skill Although the matter of it selfe be ill; Which were it true, then David might complaine, That Vzzah for his good intent was slaine. Others againe thinke superstitious Rites To be the service wherein God delights: But sith I'me forc'd my minde of them to speake, I must needs say their judgements are but weake. The like I must of them who dis-esteeme All former customes, and doe onely deeme Their owne praise-worthy: As also such as doe Thinke those things best they cannot reach unto; Yet in the Vulgar this weake humor's bred: They'l sooner be with idle customes led, Or fond opinions (such as they have store) Than learne of reason or of Vertues lore. We thinke that we are strong; but what alas Is there that our great might can bring to passe? Sith though we thereto bend e'en all our will, We neither can be good nor wholly ill. God gives us needfull blessings for to use them; Which wanting power to doe, we oft abuse them. Some hold them wise and vertuous that possesse An Heremitall solitarinesse: But it proceeds from Imbicility; And for because through Non-ability, Those things they cannot well indure to doe, Which they indeed should be inur'd unto Besides they wrong their Country and their Friends; For Man (saith Tully's) borne to other ends Than for to please himselfe: a part to have The Common-wealth doth look; and Parents crave A part; so doe his friends. Then deales he well, That closely mew'd up in a carelesse Cell Keepes all himselfe? and for a little ease, Can in his conscience find to rob all these? I say he's weak, and so again I must; But adde withall, he's slothfull and unjust. Then as he's vain that precious time doth spend In fond and idle pleasure to no end: So are those weake that with contempt disdain All pleasure and delight on earth as vain; And though they would be zealous thought, &amp; wise, I shall but count them foolishly precise: For man hath cares and pleasures mixt withall Are needfull; yea, both just and naturall. We are no Angels, that our recreation Consist should only in meere contemplation: But we have bodies too, of whose due pleasure, The soules must find sometimes to be at leasure, For to participate. But in this kind, Though some find fault we are not much behind. Then 'tis through humane weaknes, when that we Of a good turn will soon forgetfull be; And readier to revenge a small offence, Than for that good to make a recompence. And so 'tis also when that we eschew, Or shun them unto whom from us is due Both love and money: this, because their own; Th' other, 'cause friendship at our need was shown. But 'tis well seen there's many so abhor To be in presence with their Creditor, That (thanklesse Elves) though he be stil their friend, They rather would desire to see his end. Hee's weak too, that's not able to withstand Any unlawfull or unjust demand: As well as he that knows not to denie Servingmens kindnesse, or Pot-curtesie. Some simple fellows, 'cause that silken-Fools (Who had their bringing up in Bacchus schools) In shew of love but deign to drink unto them, Think presently they such a favour do them, That though they feel their stomack well-nigh sick, Yet if to pledge these kinde-ones they should stick, Or for a draught, or two or three refuse them, They think in conscience they should much abuse th? Nay, there be some, and wisemen you would think That are not able to refuse their drink, Through this their weaknes, though that they be sure Tis more than their weak stomacks can endure. And why? Oh 'tis the health of some great Peere, His Masters, or his Friends he counteth deare. What then? if so the party vertuous be, Hee'l not esteem of such a foolery; If not, who e'ert be, this is my minde still, A straw for's love, his friendship, or good-will. Some muse to see those that have knowledge gain'd, And to degrees of Art in Schooles attain'd, Should have opinions stuft with heresie, And in their actions such simplicity As many have. At first, without a pause, As meere a boy as I, may tell the cause: Is't not the reason their acquired parts And knowledge they have reach'd unto by Arts, Is growne a match too great and farre unfit For to be joyned with their naturall wit? 'Tis so: and they instead of rightfull using, Draw from their learning errors by abusing. Plaine reason shewes, and every man that's wise Knowes, though that Learning be a dainty prize, Yet if that fate with such a weakling place it, Who hath no helps of Nature for to grace it, Of one whose proper knowledge is so small Hee is beholding to his booke for all; It onely breeds (unlesse it be some Treasons) Crippled opinions and prodigious Reasons: Which being favour'd, bring, in the conclusion; Publike dissentions, or their owne confusion. For I may liken learning to a Shield, With a strong Armour, lying in a field Ready for any man that hath the wit To take it up, and arme himselfe with it. Now if he be a man of strength and might, That happens on that furniture to light, He may doe wonders; As offend his foe, And keepe himselfe and his from overthrow: But if a weake and feeble man should take These instruments of Mars, what would they make For his advantage? Surely I should gather They would goe neere to overthrow him rather: For they would load him so, a man more strong, Although he be unarm'd, may do him wrong. So he that is depriv'd of natures gifts, With all his learning, maketh harder shifts, Through his own weaknesse, and incurs more shames Than many that want art to write their names. We have some fellows that would scorn to be Tearm'd weak I know, especially by me, Because they see that my ungentle fate Allow'd me not to be a Graduate; Yet whatsoever they will say unto it, For all their scorning I am like to do it. And to be briefe, they are no simple fools, But such as have yauld Ergo in the Schooles; Who being by some men of Worship thought Fit men by whom their children may be taught, And learn'd enough, for that they are allow'd The name of Teachers; whereof growing proud, Because (perhaps) they heare that now and then They are admir'd at by the Servingmen; Or else by reason something they have said, Hath been applauded by the Chamber-maid; They thereupon suppose that no man may Hold any thing for truth but what they say: And in discourse their tongues so much will walk, You may not heare a man of reason talk; They are halfe Preachers; if your question be Of matters that concern Divinity. If it be Law, Ile warrant they'l out-face A dozen Ploydens to maintain their case: But if it be of Physick you contend, Old Galen and Hypocrates may send For their opinion; nay, they dare prosesse Knowledge in all things, though there's none know lesse: Now I should wonder they prevail'd so much Did not the Common-people favour such; But they are known, although their verdit passes, Proud Dogmatists, and selfe-conceited Asses; Whom I may term (though I cannot out-scold them) Weak simple fools, and those that do uphold them. Moreover, some (but foolishly precise, And in my judgement far more weak than wise) Mis-judge of Poetrie, as if the same Did worthily deserve reproach and blame: If any Book in verse they hap to spie, Oh, out upon't, away, prophane, they cry; Burn't, read it not, for sure it doth contain Nothing but fables of a lying brain; All-asse take heed, indeed it oft pollutes The outside of thy false-vain-glorious-sutes: And to the blinded people makes it plain, The colour thou so counterfeits will stain. Because we see that men are drunk with Wine, Shall we contemne the liquor of the Vine? And sith there's some that do this Art misuse, Wilt therefore thou the Art it selfe abuse? 'Twere meer injustice: For Divinity Hath with no Science more affinity Than this; and howsoe'er this scruple rose, Rime hath exprest as sacred things as Prose; When both in this age and in former time, Prose hath bin ten-times more profane than Rime. But they say still that Poetry is lies And fables; such as idle heads devise; Made to please fools: but now we may by this Perceive their weaknesse plainly what it is: Yea, this both weak and ignorant doth prove them, In that they'l censure things that are above them: For if that worthy Poets did not teach A way beyond their dull conceited reach, I think their shallow wisdomes would espie, A Parable did differ from a Lie. Yea, if their judgement be not quite bereft; Or if that they had any reason left, The precious Truthes within their Fables wrapt, Had not upon so rude a censure hapt. But though that kinde of teaching some dispraise, As there's few good things lik't of now adaies: Yet I dare say, because the Scriptures show it, The best e'er taught on earth taught like a Poet: And whereas Poets now are counted base, And in this worthlesse age in much disgrace; I of the cause cannot refrain to speak; And this it is; Mens judgements are grown weak, They know not true desert; for if they did, Their well-deservings could not so be hid. And sure if there be any doth despise Such as they are, it is cause he envies Their worthinesse, and is a secret foe To every one that truely learnes to know: For of all sorts of men, her's my beliefe, The Poet is most worthy and the chiefe. His Science is the absolut'st and best, And deserves honour above all the rest; For 'tis no humane knowledge gain'd by Art, But rather 'tis inspir'd into the heart By Divine meanes; and I do muse men dare Twixt it and their professions make compare. For why should he that's but Philosopher, Geometrician, or Astrologer, Paysitian, Lawyer, Rhetorician, Historian, Arithmetician, Or some such like; why should he (having found The means but by one art to be renown'd) Compare with him that claims to have a part And interest almost in every Art? And if that men may adde unto their name, By one of these an everlasting fame, How much more should it unto them befall, That have not onely one of these, but all, As Poets have? For do but search their works And you shall finde within their writtngs lurks All knowledge; if they undertake Of Divine matters any speech to make, You'll think them Doctors. If they need to tell The course of Starres, they seem for to excell Great Ptolomey; intend they to perswade, You'l think that they were Rhetoricians made. What Law, what Physick, or what History Can these not treat of? Nay, what Mysterie Are they not learn'd in? If of Trades they write, Have they not all their tearmes and words as right As if they had serv'd an Apprentiship? Can they not name all tools for Workmanship? We see 'tis true. If once he treat of Warres, Of cruell bloudy fraies, of wounds, of scarres; Why then he speaks so like a Souldier there, That he hath been begot in armes thou'lt sweare. Again, he writes so like a Navigator, As if he had serv'd Neptune in the water; And thou wouldst think he might of travell make As great a volume as our famous Drake. Old Proteus and Vertumnus are but Apes Compar'd to these for shifting of their shapes; There is no humorous Passion so strange, To which they cannot in a moment change: Note but their Dramaticks and you shall see They'l speak for every sex, for each degree, And in all causes; as if they had been In every thing, or at least all things seen. If need be they can like a Lawyer prate, Or talk more gravely like a man of State; They'l have a Tradesmans tongue to praise their ware, And counterfeit him right (but they'l not sweare.) The curioust Physitians (if they please) Shall not coyne words to give their Patient ease So well as they; and if occasion urge, They'l Choler, yea and Melancholy purge, Onely with Charmes and words; and yet it shall Be honest means, and meerely naturall: Are they dispos'd to gossip't like a woman, They'l shew their tricks so right, that almost no man But would so think them: Virgins that are purest, And Matrons that make shew to be demurest, Speak not so like chast Cynthia as they can, Nor Newbery so like a Curtezan. They'l give words either fitting for a Clown, Or such as shall not unbeseem a Crown. In shew they will be cholerick, ambitious, Desperate, jealous, mad, or envious; In sorrow, or in any Passion be; But yet remain still from all Passions free: For they have onely to this end exprest them, That men may see them plainer, and detest them. But some will say that these have on the Stage So painted out the vices of this Age, That it not onely tells that they have bin Experienc'd in every kinde of sin; But that it also doth corrupt and show How men should act those sinnes they did not know. Oh hatefull saying! not pronounc'd by chance, But spew'd out of malicious ignorance. Weigh it, and you will either think these weak, Or say that they do out of envy speak. Can none declare th' effect of Drunkennesse, Vnlesse they used such like beastlinesse? Are all men ignorant what comes by Lust, Excepting those that were themselves unjust? Or think they no man can describe a sin, But that which he himselfe hath wallowed in? If they suppose so, I no cause can tell, But they may also boldly say as well They are Apprentises to every Trade, Of which they finde they have descriptions made; Or else because they see them write those things That do belong to Rule, best say th' are Kings: As though that sacred Poesie inspir'd No other knowledge than might be acquir'd By the dull outward sense; yes, this is she That shows us not alone all things that be, But by her power laies before our view, Such wondrous things as Nature never knew. And then whereas they say that men are worse By reading that these write, 'tis their own curse; For, is the flower faulty cause we see The loathsome Spider, and the painfull Bee Make divers use on't? No, it is the same Vnto the Spider, though she cannot frame Like sweetnesse as the Bee thence. But indeed I must confesse that this bad age doth breed Too many that without respect presume This worthy title on them to assume, And undeserv'd; base fellows, whom meer time Hath made sufficient to bring forth a Rime. A Curtain Iigge, a Libell, or a Ballet, For Fidlers or some Rogues with staffe and wallet To sing at doores: men onely wise enough, Out of some rotten-old-worm-eaten stuffe To patch up a bald witlesse Comedy, And trim it here and there with ribauldry Learn'd at a Bawdy-house? I say there's such, And they can never be disgrac'd too much. For though the name of Poet such abuses, Yet they are enemies to all the Muses, And dare not sort with them for feare they will Tumble them headlong down Parnassus hill. Why then should their usurping of it, wrong That title which doth not to them belong? And wherefore should the shame of this lew'd crew Betide them unto whom true honour's due? It shall not, for how ere they use the name, Their works will shew how they do merit fame; And though it be disgrac'd through ignorance, The generous will Poesie advance, As the most antique Science that is found, And that which hath been the first root and ground Of every Art; yea, that which onely brings Content, and hath been the delight of Kings. Great Iames our King both loves and lives a Poet, (His books now extant do directly show it) And that shall adde unto his worthy name A better glory, and a greater fame Than Britains Monarchie; for few but he (I think) will both a King and Poet be; And for the last, although some fools debase it, Ime in the minde that Angells do imbrace it: And though God giv't here but in part to some, All shall have't perfect in the World to come. This in defence of Poesie to say I am compell'd, because that at this day Weaknesse and Ignorance have wrong'd it sore: But what need any man therein speak more Than Divine Sidney hath already done? For whom (though he deceas'd e'er I begun) I have oft sighed and bewaild my fate, That brought me forth so many yeares too late To view that Worthy; And now think not you Oh Daniel, Drayton, Iohnson, Chapman, how I long to see you, with your fellow Peers, Sylvester matchlesse, glory of these yeares: I hitherto have onely heard your fames, And know you yet but by your Works and Names: The little time I on the earth have spent, Would not allow me any more content: I long to know you better, that's the truth, I am in hope you'l not disdain my Youth: For know, you Muses-Darlings, Ile not crave A fellowship amongst you for to have: Oh no; for though my ever-willing heart Hath vow'd to love and praise You and your Art, And though that I your stile do now assume, I do not, nor I will not so presume; I claime not that too-worthy name of Poet; It is not yet deserv'd by me, I know it: Grant me I may but on your Muses tend, And be enrol'd their Servant, or their Friend; And if desert hereafter worthy make me, Then for a Fellow (if it please you) take me. But yet I must not here give off to speak, To tell men wherein I have found them weak, And chiefly those which cannot brook to heare Mention of death, but with much griefe and feare: For many are not able once to take That thought into them, but their Soules will quake. Poore feeble spirits, would you ne'er away, But dwell for ever in a piece of clay? What finde you here wherein you do delight, Or what's to seeing that is worth the sight? What? do the heavens thy endeavours blesse, And wouldst thou therefore live still to possesse The joy thou hast? Seek't not; perhaps to morrow Thou'lt wish t'have di'd to day to scape the sorrow Thou then shalt see: for shame take stronger hearts, And adde more courage to your better parts: For death's not to be fear'd, sith 'tis a friend That of your sorrows makes a gentle end. But here a quality I call to minde, That I amongst the common people finde; This 'tis, a weak one too; When they perceive A Friend ne'er death, and ready for to leave This wretched life; and if they heare him say Some parting words, as if he might not stay, Nay, say not so (these Comforters reply) Take heart, your time's not come, ye shall not die: What man, and grace of God you shall be stronger, And live no doubt yet many a fair day longer; Think not on death; With many such like words, Such as their understanding best affords: But where is now become this peoples wit? What do their knowledges esteem more fit Than death to think on? chiefly when men be About to put off their mortalitie. Me thinks they rather should perswade them then Fearelesse to be resolv'd to die like men: For, want of such a resolution stings At point of death; and dreadfull horrour brings E'en to the Soule; cause wanting preparation, She lies despairing of her own salvation. Yea, and moreover this full well know I He that's at any time afraid to die, Is in weak case; and whatsoe'er he saith, Hath but a wavering and a feeble faith. But what need I go further to relate The frailty I have seen in Mans estate? Sith this I have already said makes cleare, That of all creatures God hath placed here, (Provided we respect them in their kinde) Wee cannot any more unable finde; For of our selves we have not power to speak, No, nor to frame a thought we are so weak. Against our bodies every thing prevailes, And oft our knowledge and our judgement fails: Yea, if that one mans strength were now no lesse Than all men do in generall possesse; Or if he had attain'd to ten times more Than all Gods creatures joyn'd in one before; Yet would his power be ev'n then so small When he stands surest hee's but sure to fall. 'Tis onely weaknesse that doth make us droop, And unto crosses and diseases stoop; That makes us vain, inconstant, and unsure, Vnable any good things to endure: It brings us to the servile base subjection Of all loose passion and untam'd affection: It leads us and compells us oft to stray Both bsiede truth, and out of Reasons way: And lastly wee, and that because of this, Either do nothing, or do all amisse. Which being so we may with David then Confesse that we are rather Wormes than Men. Of Presumption. Satyr. 4. Soft heedlesse Muse, thou no advisement tak'st; Wast not of Men that last of all thou spak'st? It was, and of the weaknesse too of Men: Come then with shame now and deni't agen: Recant; for so the matter thou did'st handle, Thou maist be curst for't with bell, book, and candle. Is mankinde weak? Who then can by their powers Into the aire hurle Palaces and Towers? And with one blast e'en in a moment make Whole Kingdomes and brave Monarchies to shake? Or what are they that dare for to aspire Unto Gods seat, and if it might be, higher: That forgive sinnes as fast as men can doe them, And make Iehovah be beholding to them? I've heard of such; What are they? would I wist; They can make Saints (they say) of whom they list: And being made, above the stars can seat them, Yea, with their own hands make their gods; &amp; eat th? Ha? Are they men? how dar'st thou then to speak Such blasphemy, to say, Mankinde is weak? I tell thee this, Muse, either man is strong, And through thy babling thou hast done him wrong; Or else beyond his limits he doth erre, And for Presumption puts down Lucifer. Is't so? Nay then I prethee Muse go on, And let us heare of his Presumption: For I do know, cause I have heard him vaunt, That hee's a Creature proud and arrogant: And it may be he is not of such might As he makes shew for; but usurps some's right. Ther'e goes indeed: For though he be so base, So weak, and in such miserable case, That I want words of a sufficient worth To paint his most abhorred vildenesse forth; Yet such is also his detested pride, That I suppose the Devill is beli'd By every man that shall affirme or say He is more proud. For do but mark I pray This Creature Man: Did Natures powerfull King (GOD, that of nothing framed every thing) Mould out of Clay a piece which he had rent E'en from the Earth, the basest Element? And whereas he might have been made a Thrall, Yea, and the very Vnderling of all; That God with title of Chiefe-Ruler grac'd him, And as a Steward over all things plac'd him: Gave him a pleasant Garden for to till, And leave to eate of ev'ry Tree at will; Onely of one indeed he did deny him, And peradventure of that one to try him. But see his insolence, though God did threat Death if he eate, and though that God was great, And so exceeding just, that he well knew All that he threatned doubtlesse would ensue: Thogh God were strong, &amp; could, had man bin prouder (Poor clay-bred worm) have stampt him into pouder; Yet (notwithstanding all this same) did he Presume to taste of that Forbidden-tree. A rash beginning, but he sped so ill, D'yee think he held on this presumption still? To heare he had left that offence 'twere news; But Cain and Nimrod, Pharaoh and the Iewes Shew'd it continued; and grew much more, Rather than lesser than it was before. Cain in his murder and his proud reply; Nimrod, in that he dar'd to build so high; Pharaoh, by boldly tempting God, to show His sundry plagues to Ãgypts overthrow: And many waies the last. But what need I Recite examples of Antiquity? Or thus to tax old ages of that crime, Sith there was ne'er a more presumptuous time Than this that's now. What dare not men to do, If they have any list or minde thereto? Their fellow-creatures they do much contemne, Vaunting that all things were ordain'd for them; Yea, both the gladsome daies, and quiet nights, Sun, Moon, and Heaven, with those glorious lights, Which so bespangle that fair azure roofe: They think were onely made for their behoofe: Whenas, alas, their power and weak command, Cannot extend so far as to withstand The least Stars force; o're them and their estate, Sunne, Moon, and Starres too do predominate. Before our Fall indeed we did excell All other Creatures that on earth did dwell; But now I think the very worst that be, Have just as much to boast upon as wee, Our Soul's defil'd; And therefore if in Sense We place our worth and chiefe preheminence, Tis known that there be divers creatures then Will have the upper hand; for they passe men: And though we still presume upon't, 'tis vain To challenge our old Soveraignty again: For when that we from our obedience fell, All things against us also did rebell; Lions, and Beares, and Tygers sought our bloud, The barren earth deni'd to yeeld us food: The clouds rain'd plagues, and yet dare we go on, We take such pleasure in Presumption. But for because there's some do scarcely know How we do in that fault offend, Ile show: First, when that they new worshippings invent, And cannot hold themselves so well content With that which God doth in his Word ordain, As with inventions of their own weak brain; It seems they think their fancies to fulfill, Would please him better than to have his will. Next, I do reckon them that over-bold Gods sacred Legend have at will controld; And maugre his grand curse, some places chang'd; Added to some; and some again estrang'd. Then those great Masters I presumptuous deem, That of their knowledge do so well esteem: They will force others as the Papists do For to allow of their opinions too; Yea, though it be a meer imagination, That neither hath good ground, nor just foundation: Some will be prying, though they are forbidden, Into those secrets God meant should be hidden. So do some Students in Astrologie, Though they can make a faire Apologie. And so do those that very vainly trie To finde our fortunes by their Palmistrie: These do presume, but much more such as say, At this or that time comes the judgment-day. Or such as ask, or dare for to relate What God was doing e'er he did create Heaven and Earth: or where he did abide, How and by whom he then was glorifi'd. But those that into such deep secrets winde, A slender profit in their labour finde; For to make known how highly they offend, A desperate madnesse is oft times their end. Yet such their nature is, they'll not beware, But to be prying further still they dare: For sure that longing can no way be staid: Which well the Poet seem'd to know, who said; Man, what he is forbidden, still desires, And what he is deni'd of most requires. Rather than many will a man gain-say, They dare make bold with God; they think they may, Because it seems they deem him not so strong, Or so well able to revenge a wrong. Some such great power to themselves assume, And on their own strength do so much presume, They seldome do for Gods assistance crave; As if it were a needlesse thing to have Which is the cause that often the conclusion Proves their own shame, their hindrance, &amp; confusion In praying men presume, unlesse they be With every one in love and charitie: Or if in their Petitions they desire Such things as are unlawfull to require. Death's their reward we know, that break the law; But neither that, nor yet damnations awe Keeps us from sinne: a thousand God-heads more Than one we make, and dare for to adore Our own hand-works: the Sabbath we disdain, And dreadlesse take the Name of God in vain. If but by his Lords hand an Irish sweare, To violate that oath he stands in feare; Lest him both of his lands and goods he spoile, For making him the instrument of guile: And yet dare we (poore worms) before his face, (Respecting whom, the greatest Lords are base) Both sweare, and forsweare, using that great Name At pleasure, without any feare of blame. Why should not we as well suppose that he Who in our hearts would have no fraud to be; Will miserable, poore, and naked leave us, Yea, of those blessings and estates bereave us We now hold of him, if we thus contemne, And still abuse his sacred Name, and him? But men secure in wickednesse persist, As if they could please God with what they list; If they can, Lord have mercy on them, say, And mumble some few praiers once a day, There needs no more: nay surely, there be such, That think it is enough, if not too much. But what's the reason? God made all the man, Why should he have but part allow'd him then? He in their service nothing doth delight, Vnlesse it be with all their strength and might, With their whole heart and soule, and that way too As he appoints them in his Word to do. Some men there are who hope by honesty, By their Almes-deeds and works of Charitie To win Gods favour, and so to obtain Salvation by it; but their hope's in vain. Others there are, who for because th' have faith For to beleeve 'tis true the Scripture saith; Sith they have knowledge in Religion, And make thereof a strict profession; Or do observe the outward worship duly. Do think that therein they have pleas'd God truly. Now these are just as far as th' other wide, For they Gods worship do by halves divide; And for his due which is e'en all the heart, Do dare presume to offer him a part. But th' one must know he will not pleased be With a Religion that wants honestie: And th' other that as little good will doe, His honest shews without Religion too. If this be so (as so it is indeed) How then will those presumptuous fellows speed Who think (forsooth) because that once a yeare They can afford the poore some slender cheere, Observe their Countrey feasts, or Common doles, And entertain their Christmas Wassaile-bowles Or else because that for the Churches good, They in defence of Hock-tide custome stood, A Whitson-Ale, or some such goodly motion, The better to procure Youngmens devotion? What will they do, I say, that think to please Their mighty God with such vain things as these? Sure very ill; for though that they can mone, And say that Love and Charitie is gone, As old folks do, because their banquettings, Their ancient Drunken Summer-revellings Are out of date, though they can say, through teaching And since the Gospell hath had open preaching, Men are grown worse; though they can soon espie A little mote in their own neighbours eye; Yea, though that they their Pater-noster can, And call their honest neighbour Puritan; How e'er they in their own conceits may smile, Yet sure they are Presumptuous, weak, and vile. Also in this abominable time, It is amongst us now a common crime, To flout and scoffe at those which we espie Willing to shake off humane Vanity; And those that gladly do themselves enforce Vnto a strict and more religious course Than most men do; although they truly know No men are able to pay halfe they owe Vnto their God; (as though their wisdomes thought He might be served better than he ought) They count precise and curious more than needs, They try their sayings, and weigh all their deeds: A thousand things that they well do, shall be Sleightly past over, as if none did see: But one thing ill done (though the best does ill) They shall be certain for to heare of still; Yea, notwithstanding they can daily smother Millions of ten-times-greater faults in other. Who are so hated, or so often blam'd? Or so revil'd, or scorn'd, or so misnam'd? To whom do we now our contentions lay? Who are so much term'd Puritans as they That feare God most? But 'tis no marvell men Presume so much to wrong his children, when As if they fear'd not his revengefull rod, They can blaspheme, and dare to anger God. Now by these words to some men it may seem, That I have Puritanes in high esteem; Indeed, if by that name you understand Those whom the vulgar Atheists of this land Do daily terme so; that is such as are Fore-named here; and have the greatest care To know and please their Maker: then 'tis true I love them well, for love to such is due: But if you mean, The busie-headed sect, The hollow crew, the counterfeit Elect: Our Dogmatists, and ever-wrangling spirits, That do as well contemne good works as merits: If you mean those that make their care seem great To get soules food, when 'tis for bodies meat; Or those, all whose religion doth depend On this, That they know how to discommend A May-game, or a Summer-pole defie, Or shake the head, or else turn up the eye: If you mean those, however they appear, This I say of them, (would they all might heare) Though in a zealous habite they do wander, Yet they are Gods foes and the Churches slander; And though they humble be in shew to many, They are as haughty every way as any. What need I here the lewd presumptions tell Of Papists in these daies? 'tis known too well. For them thereof each Peasant now convinces, In things as well concerning God as Princes. Others I finde too that do dare presume, The office of a Teacher to assume, And being blinde themselves and gone astray, Take on them to shew other men the way. Yea some there be who have small gifts of spirit, No kinde of knowledge, and as little merit, That with the world have made a firm conjunction, Yet dare to undergoe the sacred function Of Christ his Pastor. Yea, such is their daring, That (neither for their Charge nor Duty caring) Instead of giving good and sound instruction, They lead themselves and others to destruction. We read that Ieremie and Moses both, To undertake this charge were wondrous loth. (The greatnesse of the same so much appall'd them) Yea, though that God himselfe directly call'd them; But our brave Clarks, as if they did condemne The too much bashfull backwardnesse of them; Or else as if themselves they abler thought; Those Divine callings have not onely sought Without respect of their ability, A Christian Conscience or civilitie; But being of old Simon Magus tribe, Purchase it often with a hatefull bribe; Which shewes that they such places do desire, Not for the good of others, but their hire. But Patrons, feare ye neither God nor Hell? Dare ye the Churches patrimony sell For filthy lucre, in despight of Law Sacred or humane? Pedants, dare ye? Haw! Dare ye buy't of them? By Gods help, unlesse This villanie e'er long have some redresse, Ile finde a means, or else let me have blame, To bring some smart, or else eternall shame Vpon you for't; It may be you do sent it, But all your policy shall not prevent it. What do you look for? Hell and your Damnation? Well, you shall have it by impropriation; I know now you have entred Simony, You'll double-damne your Souls with Perjury. For they as oft together may be seen, As is the chilling Fever and the Spleen. But, oh, deare Countreymen, be more advis'd; Think what God is, he may not be despis'd. Could you well weigh his justice and his power, How many infinites it passeth our, And knew his judgements, you would not dissemble An outward feigned reverence, but tremble And shake with horror; you'd not dare to venter Sanctum Sanclorum so unfit to enter. His Churches good you rather would advance, Than rob it thus of her inheritance; Or make the same as men still unbeleeving, Like to a house of merchandise and theeving. You to whom deeds of former times are known, Mark to what passe this age of ours is grown, Even with us that do strictest seem to be In the professing of Christianitie; You know men have been carefull to augment The Churches portion, and have been content To adde unto it out of their estate; And Sacriledge all Nations did so hate, That the meer Irish, who seem'd not to care For God nor man, had the respect to spare The Churches profits; yea, their heed was such, That in the time of need they would not touch The known provisions they daily saw Stor'd up in Churches: in such feare and awe The places held them; though that they did know The things therein belonged to their foe; But now the world and mans good nature's chang'd, From this opinion most men are estrang'd; We rob the Church, and what we can attain By Sacriledge and Theft is our best gain. In paying dues, the refues of our stock, The barrenest and leanest of our flock Shall serve our Pastor: whom for to deceive, We think no sinne. Nay further (by your leave) Men seek not to impropriate a part Vnto themselves; but they can finde in heart T'engrosse up all: which vile Presumption Hath broght church-livings to a strange consumption. And if this strong disease do not abate, 'Twill be the poorest member in the state. No marvell though in stead of learned Preachers, We have been pester'd with such simple Teachers, Such poore, mute, tongue-tide Readers, as scarce know Whether that God made Adam first, or no: Thence it proceeds, and there's the cause that Place And Office at this time incurres disgrace. For men of judgment, or good dispositions Scorne to be ty'd to any base conditions, Like to our hungry Pedants, who'l engage Their soules for any curtail'd Vicarage. I say, there's none of knowledge wit, or merit, But such as are of a most servile spirit, That will so wrong the Church as to presume Some poore-halfe-demi-Parsonage to assume In name of all; no, they had rather quite Be put beside the same, than wrong Gods right. Well, they must entertain such Pedants then, Fitter to feed Swine than the soules of men, But Patrons think such best, for there's no feare They will speak any thing they loathe to heare: They may run foolishly to their damnation Without reproofe, or any disturbation; To let them see their vice they may be bold, And yet not stand in doubt to be controld: Those in their houses may keep private Schooles, And either serve for jesters or for fools, And will suppose that they are highly grac'd, Be they but at their Patrons table plac'd: And there if they be cal'd but Priests in scoffe, Straight they duck down, and all their caps come off, Supposing it for to be done in kindnesse, Which shews their weaknesse &amp; apparant blindenesse Moreover, 'tis well known that former time Held it to be a vile presumptuous crime, Such men in sacred Offices to place Whom they knew touch'd with any foule disgrace, Or to allow those whom they did suspect To have an outward bodily defect: But be they now not onely crooked, lame, Dismember'd, and of the unshapeliest frame That ever Nature form'd; though they be blinde, Not in sight onely, but as well in minde; Though they be such, who if they came to shreeving, Might confesse murther, whordome, slander, theeving, And all damn'd villany; yet these men will be Admitted to the sacred Ministrie. But most of us do now disdain that place, Accounting it unworthy, mean, and base; Yea, like to Ieroboams Priests wee see They of the lowest of the people be; And though we know the Israelites allow'd God the First-born for his; we are so proud, Vnlesse they either do want shape, or wit, Or seem for worldly businesse unfit, Few think Gods service worthy the bestowing Their Childe upon it; or such duty owing Vnto the same; but rather that vocation They count a blemish to their reputation. But where's your understanding, oh you men? Turn from your brutish dulnesse once agen; Honour Gods messengers; for why? 'tis true To them both reverence and honour's due: Think what they are, and be not still self-minded, Suffer not reason to be so much blinded; If not for love that you to justice beare, Yet follow her (although it be) for feare: And see that this Presumption you amend, Or look some heavy plague shall be your end. Then it is also a Presumptuous act, With knowledge to commit a sinfull fact, Though ne'er so small: for sinne's a subtle elfe, That by degrees insinuates it selfe Into our soules; and in a little space Becomes too huge a Monster to displace: Yea, it is certain that one sinne, though small, Will make an entrance great enough for all; And what is't but Presumption to abuse, And without feare and reverence to use Gods Sacred Word? Yet we that Christ professe Think it no fault, or that there's no fault lesse: Else sure we would not in our common talk, Let our loose tongues so much at randome walk; We would not dare our jests of that to make, At uttering where of the heavens shake; For if God had reveal'd his Gospell news To us, as heretofore unto the Iews He did the Law: who heard him to their wonder, Speaking through fearfull firy flames of Thunder; We would not dread in any evill fashion, To use that sacred means of our salvation. Our cursed Pagan unbeleeving foe, I meane the Turk, more reverence doth show In those his damn'd erroneous Rites, than we In the true Worship: for 'tis known that he Will not so much as touch his Alcharon, That doth contain his false Religion, With unwash'd hands; nor till he hath o'er-went All that his vain and confus'd rabblement Of Ceremonies us'd, much lesse dares look On the Contents of that unhallowed Book: But we in midst of all our villany, In our Pot-conference and Ribaldrie, Irreverently can the same apply, As if't were some of Pasquils-Letany. But soft, my Muse in her perambulation Hath hapt upon an Excommunication: And though that her Commission she wanted, Yet she made bold to search wherefore 'twas granted; Which if you would know too; why, it may be Some were so pleas'd because they lack'd a fee: For had the Officers been well contented, They say the matter might have been prevented. But you that have the wisedomes to discerne When abuse is, pray tell me, I would learne: Misuse we not Excommunication? You know, It is a Separation From God: and a most fearfull banishment, From the partaking of his Sacrament, And good mens fellowship; a sad exile (Perhaps for ever, at the least a while) From the true Church, and oh (most horrid evill) A giving of men over to the Devill. And therefore was ordain'd in better times Onely for such, who in their hainous crimes, With hardned obstinacie did persist, As may appeare: but now, we at our list, As if the same but some sleight matter were, For every trifle to pronounce it dare; And peradventure too, on such as be More honest far, and better much than we. But sith my Muse hath her endeavour done, To note how men into this fault do run; I will be bold to let you understand One strange Presumption noted in our Land, Worth the amending: and indeed 'tis this (Reader, pray judge how dangerous it is.) We seeing God hath now removed farre, From this our Country his just plague of warre, And made us through his mercy so much blest, We doe in spight of all our foes yet rest Exempt from danger: by us it appeares Through the great blessing of these quiet yeares, We are so fearelesse, carelesse, and secure, In this our happy peace, and so cock-sure, As if we did suppose, or heard it said, Old Mars were strangled, or the Divell dead: Else can I not beleeve we would so lightly Esteem our safety, and let passe so slightly Our former care of Martiall Discipline, For exercises meerely feminine: We would not see our Armes so soil'd in dust, Nor our bright blades eate up with cankerd rust, As now they be: our Bowes they lye and rot, Both Musket and Caliver is forgot; And we lie open to all forraigne dangers For want of discipline: 'tis known to Strangers, Though we'l not see't. Alas, will not our pleasure Let us be once in seven yeeres at leasure To take a muster, and to give instruction? No, rather pleasure will be our destruction. For that first caus'd the law that now prevents And barres the use of Pouder-instruments To be enacted. Why? for to preserve As idle Game, the which I wish might sterve Amids our plenty, so that with their curse The Land and People might be nothing worse; 'Cause for that trifle to the Realmes abuse, The Hand-gun hath beene so much out of use. Scarce one in forty, if to proofe it came, Dares, or knowes well how to discharge the same. Oh valiant English, we are like to hold The glory that our fathers had of old: But sure I thinke some undermining-hand, That studies for the ruine of the Land, Is cause of this; in hope thereby at length To weaken ours, and let in Forraigne strength. What do we think, cause there's a truce with Spain That we are safe? alas, that thought is vaine: Our dangers rather more. For while they dar'd To proffer wrong they found us still prepar'd: The profitable feare that we were in Prevented danger that might else have bin. But now the cause of forraigne feare is gone, We have not onely let all care alone, But also are so drunken with delights, And drown'd in pleasures that our dulled sprites, Are so o'er-clogd with Luxury, we droope, More fit for Venus than for Mars his troope: That if our foes should now so ventrous be As to invade the Land, unlesse that we With speed amend this error here's my minde, The way to worke our ruine they'l soon finde: For just the Troians last nights watch we keep, Who then were buried all in wine and sleepe. We read, when Cato should a Captaine chuse For the Pannonian fight, he did refuse His kinsman Publius, 'cause that from the warre He often had return'd without a scarre, And went perfum'd. But if such faults as these Displeas'd the Censor, sure then in our daies, He scarcely would in Towne or Country finde A man with us according to his minde Such is our daintinesse. Besides, to strangers (As if there were no cause to doubt of dangers) We doe not onely our great riches show, (A shrewd temptation to allure a foe) But we moreover plainely doe declare By fond apparell, too superfluous fare, Much idlenesse and other wanton parts, That we have weake effeminated hearts, Which being known are sure a great perswasion Vnto our enemies to make invasion. But we doe say, in God's our only trust, On him we doe depend: Well, so we must, And yet we ought not therefore to disdaine The lawfull meanes by which he doth ordaine To worke our safety then: for that's a signe We rather love to tempt the Powers Divine, Than trust unto them. Worthy Brittaines then, Leave this presumption, once againe be men, Not weake Sardanapali; leave those toyes To idle Women, wanton Girles and Boies: Vnto our foes I wish you could betake them, Or unto any, so you would forsake them. Let Martialists that long have been disgrac'd Be lov'd again and in our favours plac'd: Count not them Rogues, out rather such as can So much degenerate themselves from Man, In tyre and gesture both to womanize. Goe call a Parliament, and there devise An act to have them whipt now: oh 'twere good, A deed well worthy such a noble brood Meane while lets trim our rusty Armes and scoure Those long unused well-steel'd-blades of our; (We shall not doe the Spiders any wrong, For they have rent-free held their house-roome long In Morains, Helmets, Gauntlets, Bandileeres: Displace them thence, they have had all their yeeres) And give them such a lustre that the light May dimme the Moon-shine in a Winters night; Away with idle Citherns, Lutes and Tabers, Let knocks requite the Fidlers for their labours. Bring in the warlike Drum, 'twill musick make ye, That from your drousie pleasures will awake ye: Or else that hartning Trumpet that from farre May sound unto you all the points of warre. Let dances turne to marches; you ere long May know what doth to Ranks and Files belong. And let your thundering shot so smoke and rore, Strangers may tremble to behold the shore, And know you sleepe not. But now to what end, Doe you suppose that I these words doe spend? Beleeve me, I'm not male content with peace, Nor doe desire this happy time might cease; I would not have you foule seditions make, Or any unjust warres to undertake: But I desire you leave those idle fashions, That have beene the just fall of many Nations. Looke well unto your selves and not suppose. 'Cause there's a league with Spaine, we have no foes. For, if Warres ever make this Land complaine, It will be thought some Truce it had with Spaine. But here I bid you once againe beware, Delay not time, but with all speed prepare; Repaire your Forts again, and man them well, Place better Captaines in them: I can tell Some are growne covetous, and there's no trust To such as they; that vice makes men unjust. They pocket up the wages of their men, And one poore Souldier serves alone for ten. Looke to the Navy-Royall: were't well scand, I doubt it would be found but simply man'd: The Pursers study (if some not belie them) Onely which way they may have profit by them: But see unto it you to whom't belongs, See the abuses done, redresse the wrongs. And oh! renew the forces of this Land, For there's a fearefull bloudy day at hand; Though not fore-seene, a bloudy day for some, Nor will the same be long before it come. There is a tempest brewing in the South, A horrid Vapour forc'd from hels own mouth. 'Tis spread already farre into the West, And now begins to gather in the East, When 'tis at full once, it will straight come forth To showre downe all its vengeance on the North. But feare not little Ile, thy cause is right; And if thou hast not cast all care off quite, Nor art secure, why by that token then Thou shalt drive backe that threatning storme agen, Through Gods assistance; even to ruine those; By and amongst whom first of all it rose. But if that still thou carelesse snorting lie In thy presuming blind security, Take't for a signe that now thy sins are ripe, And thou shalt surely feele the death-full stripe Of that ensuing ill, unto thy shame And extirpation of thy former fame. But yet I hope, this oversight will end, And we shall this presumptuous fault amend: I hope, I say (and yet I hope no harmes) To see our English youth, trickt up in Armes; And so well traind that all their foes shall heare No newes from them, but horror, death and feare: Yea, and their March, like Iehu's King of Iury, Shall shew they come with vengeance, speed and fury. I would we could as easily forsake Other presumptions; and that we could take But halfe the care and diligence to arme Our soules in danger of a greater harme. Would we the holy weapons could assume Of Christian warfare, and not still presume To leave our better parts all open so, For the advantage of the greater foe Than Rome or Spaine. Oh would we could begin To feele the danger of presumptuous sin! Which soone would be, if we could once be brought But to consider, with an equall thought, Our base beginning and infirmity, Our wavering and wond'rous misery. And with this wretched poore estate of our Gods infinite and all-sufficient power; His justice, with his hatred unto ill, And threatnings if we disobey his will: Or else remember he doth still behold, And see us when we sin; for who so bold, Vnlesse depriv'd of grace, then to offend? But it should seeme, we our endeavours bend To anger God; for we of sinne complaine, Yet with our will, sinne in his sight againe. Say were't not a presumption very great, If comming to a King, one should intreat A pardon for some murther and yet bring The bloudy blade with which he did that thing He would have mercy for? And whilst he speaking, Sheath it againe with bloud and gore yet reaking, In the Kings sonne before his Fathers face; And yet still bide, as if he hop'd for grace? Should we not think him mad? Sure yes; yet we Cannot that madnesse in our own selves see: For, we dare come before the almighty King To sue for pardon for our sins, yet bring The selfe-same bad mind, still conceiving murther Against his children to provoke him further: And look what ill is but in thought begun With him's all one, as if the same were done. It is no marvell that no humane law Can keepe our over-daring hearts in awe; Sith that we doe so little dread the rod Of such a powerfull, and so just a God: And if in mans and Gods own sight we dare So fearelesse sin without respect or care; It seemes that we doe little conscience make What mischiefes by our selves we undertake: Or thinke it no presumption to commit Something alone in our owne sight unfit, Oh grosse and ignorant! why, that's the worst Of all presumptions the most accurst, And full'st of danger. Silly man take heed, Doe not before thy selfe an evill deed; For when God doth forgive, and man forget, Thine owne ill conscience will oppose and set Her selfe against thee, tell thee thine offending, And keep thee backe from ever apprehending Grace or forgivenesse; neither will afford The smallest comfort of the Sacred Word: But rather to thy sad remembrance call Each saying that may serve to prove thy fall: And though that fire wondrous tortures brings Vnto the body, yet when conscience stings, Nor fire, nor sword, nor hell it selfe can yeeld A worser torment. God defend and shield Me from the like; and give me grace to feare, So that I may preserve my conscience cleare In all my actions: and then I shall be In better case a thousand fold than he That unto wealth and honour hath attain'd With a craz'd conscience that is blurd and stain'd. Alas how easie were't to clime or mount To worldly reputation and account? How soone could I if I had an intention To plot and to contrive a damn'd invention Get golden heaps? yea, and so privily; That though 'twere done by craft and villany, I by the blinded world would be deemed Perhaps more honest; but much more esteemed Than now I am. But God forbid that I Such base vaine trash and dunghill stuffe should buy At such a rate. For there's no Iewell dearer, Nor any losse a man can have goes nearer Than peace of conscience. Which to be most true, The ancient Poets very wisely knew, And therefore fain'd their furies, with intent So to declare the inward punishment Of guilty minds, which sure they might do well; For there are in them Divels, yea and Hell, With all her torture. What else was the cause Nero (who knew no God, nor feared lawes) When he had killed his Mother tooke no rest, But thought he saw her comming to molest And plague him for't? What made him to surmise He was still tortur'd in such hellish wise, That Furies did to his appearance scorch Is living body with a burning torch? Was't not his conscience that had privy beene Unto the fact? Was not the cause within His owne bad selfe? If 'twere, lets to amending Of our presumptuous sinnes, and bold offending; If, neither in regard of God nor men, Oh let's for feare of our owne conscience then. Yet ther's another thing which wer't well weigh'd Our rash presumption would be somewhat stai'd. The end of life with the neere ending paine God for presumptuous sinners doth ordaine. Could we note that; with deaths uncertaine times, And how it takes men acting of their crimes Even in the very nicke of their offence, And beares them (ere they can repent them) hence To such a place where nothing shall appeare, But all the ghastly objects of grimme feare. Where every sense shall severally sustaine, The miserable smart of endlesse paine. The tender feeling, shall in every part, Be subject to th' intolerable smart Of hellish flames, commixt with chilling cold: Tortures beyond conceit; not to be told. The dainty mouth that had the curious taste And of the choisest cates still made repast, Shall filled be, yea belly, throat, and all, With filth more loathsome than the bitterest gall: The once-perfumed nostrill, there shall drink Foule noysome smels beside the sulphurous stinke Of choaking flames. And there, the listning eare, Fed with the sound of pleasant musick here, Shall change it for the wofull skreeching cry Of damned soules that in hels tortures lie; Whose hideous howlings can by no defence, Be kept from piercing that amazed sense. And then while they shall trembling think to flie From those amazements that doe seeme so nie, Loe, there the feareful'st object of the sight Their quite despairing mindes shal more affright: For garish formes of foule mishapen fiends, And ugly Bugs for evermore attends, To thwart each looke. But if this doe not make Thy over-hardned heart (oh man) to quake: If this relation be too weake to winne, Or to reclaime thee from thy wonted sinne; Reader, if this doe no impression leave, So that thou canst not any feare conceive Through this description; think upon't at night, Soone in thy bed when earth's depriv'd of light: I say at mid-night when thou wak'st from sleepe, And lonely darkenesse doth in silence keep The grim-fac'd night. And but imagine then Thou wert borne all alone to some darke den, And there set naked though thou felt no paine, Yet seeing no way to get out againe, If thou should'st in that naked lonenesse heare Some yelling voice, or some strange noise draw neare, With threatning; or but calling on thy name: Oh with what patience could'st thou bide the same! But if withall thy wandering eies should marke, And now and then see peering through the darke Some monstrous visages or ugly faces, Which would make proffer of some rude embraces, And sometime seeme as if they would begin With griping pawes to seaze thy trembling skin, Or but suppose that in thy chamber there, Where cannot be the hundreth part of feare Because to thee the place well knowne will be, And thou maist have therewith to cover thee) Yet there I say suppose thou shouldst behold, Not such grim objects as are here foretold, But onely heare the dolefull voice of men Complaining in the darke; And now and then, Behold the ghastly shape of friends long dead, Wrapt in their sheets as they were buried; Or else from out thy chamber floore to rise A troope of bony, pik'd Anatomies. Come pointing to thee, as if thou wert he That must ere long their bare companion be. Then wouldst thou feare I know, and thinke on him, Whose might and feareful power thou didst contemn, Thou wouldst consider better of the feare And hellish horror I have mention'd here. Thy dangerous estate thou wouldst conceive, And somewhat thy presumptuous actions leave; Thou wouldst not so cast all thy care behind thee, But watch thy self for feare lest death shold find thee Doing some ill; nor would'st thou thus delay Times of Repentance still from day to day. But oh! how shall I hope that this I pleade, Will worke in them that shall but barely reade What I have writ? sith I my selfe that know, And have some inward feeling of that woe Forget my selfe. I thinke when I shall be From such and such like cares and troubles free. Then will I all my vanities forsake, A better course of life I'l undertake, And only seeke the glory of his Name By whom I live. That day ere long time came, Then I had other lets, but if that they, (As I did seeke they might) were once a way, I would indeed my duty better doe: Well, so it pleas'd God, I ore-past them too. Yet something hindred still that I could never In my intended Christian course persever: But ever found unto my griefe and sorrow, That I was bad to day and worse to morrow: But oh! thou God that know'st my hearts desire, Doe not; oh doe at my hands require My youthfull sins; though this my flesh be fraile. And my affections often doe prevaile: Seeing thou know'st the weake estate of man, And what a little his small power can, Accept my will, and let thy bloud suffice To quit the rest of mine iniquities. But now, because I have observ'd such store, I needs must tell a few presumptions more. Some in contemning others wisdome; show That they presume themselves doe all things know: But that vile selfe-conceit nere raised any, Certaine I am it is the fall of many. Others (and they in this kind too offend) On their owne memories too much depend: Such I have heard so confidently speake, As if they had no thought that men were weake Yea those; though twenty men have all gain-said What they affirmed, were not yet affraid Their owne bare affirmation to out-face With sundry oathes: such wondrous trust they place In their remembrance; yea, my selfe ere now Have beene oft times more ready to avow What I thought truth; than ere I'l be againe: For what I deem'd to be so sure and plaine, That I not onely stood in't to my might, But would have pawn'd my life't had been the right That to my shame I have my selfe alone, Found to be false, when all the rest were gone Which griev'd me so, that I'l ne'er more relie Or trust so much to mine owne memorie. But what may I tearme those who for a name, Or else to get some vile preposterous fame, Will desperately for the nonce begin To put in action some ungodly sin, That all men loath; and onely (as they say) For to be talkt of. What are such I pray? Presumptuous, vaine or weake or all that's bad: The last I think; and ten-times more than mad. Yet we have Gallants and great store of such, That in their great bravado's care not much What villanies they doe. But 'tis their humour Onely to fill mens mouthes with idle rumour; And cause they know the vulgar sort do deem them Youthes of great spirit and do much esteeme them. But amongst wisemen, they are sure to gaine Reproachfull shame and well deserv'd disdaine; And yet to adde some fame unto this story, We will bequeath them Erostratus glory. Nor have our old men left that humour yet, For though through feeblenesse they are unfit To put in practice their old tricks againe: Yet for to shew they like them and would faine; They'l often with a lie or two recite them; And the remembrance doth so much delight them, That whereas they ought rather to repent, And with a grieved heart for to lament Their former folly; they with joy and laughter Seeme to approv't in those that shall come after. There's yet another crew, my Muse well knowes, To whom she here a Memorandum owes, Although no commendations; for they are But busie fellowes, and do boldly dare Take on them in their comments, forth to finde The secret meaning of each Authors minde; And do apply that, in particular, Which doth extend to all ingenerall: And in this little Booke perhaps, they can Say, here I meant one, there another man; And by their names they will not stick to shew them When as perhaps I nere so much as knew them. So from my honest meaning they will reare them A slander for some private grudge they beare them. But though these are so bold, yet I beleeve, Or hope at least, no men of wisdome give Credit to any such interpretations, That are but idle false imaginations; Sith each of these what stile soe'er he crave, Doth shew himselfe presumptuous foole and knave. But here all you that are quite voide of care, What you presume in: chiefly you that dare, Mauger Gods threats, goe forward to fulfill Your naughty, rash, unbridled haire-braine will: As if you thought that you your selves made all, And that indeed there were no God at all. Know this, ere long time it shall come to passe, That you shall howling fit and cry, alas: Cursing your birth and miserable state, With sad repentance when it is too late, Vnlesse you now take time. Oh wormes! oh men! Forsake your follies, oh forsake them then. What will ye doe else when once seaz'd by death, Ready to draw the latest gaspe of breath; When as you are so weake that you would faine But cannot move your tongues for to complaine What would you doe if then there should appeare The Authors of most miserable feare, Your guilty consciences, and there unroule To your remembrances the dreadfull scroule Of your presumptions? and withall present A vision of th' infernall punishment, Prepar'd for such; and if in that bad case You should behold him you esteem'd so base Sit with such power, that at each frown he makes The earth doth tremble, and the heaven shakes: What would you doe? oh any thing: I'm sure No paine there is but you would then endure To scape his wrath (if you doe not despaire) Then will you beg, intreat, and promise faire Or any thing, if so it were you might, Returne to life againe; then would you quite Alter your doeings; then forsooth you'l be A patterne unto all posterity; You would be humble, meeke, devout and chaste: But now there's time, and then it may be past. Yet I my selfe have heard those that have vow'd Much in their anguish, and God hath allow'd A longer time, yea, hath vouchsaf'd to save And give them life againe, e'en at the grave: And yet have these forgot their former paine, And turn'd unto their owne ill-waies againe: Which having seene, this for us men I'l speake, Not without griefe, though nothing be so weake: Yet are we in our owne conceipts so tall, That for presumption we doe out-passe all: And if so be that this same hardning sin Doe seaze upon the heart once, and get in; My minde is this, 'twill ne'er be purg'd thence well, No, not with all the feares and pangs of Hell. EPILOGVS. So in some measure I have now made knowne What foule Abuses Time to me hath showne; And what Man is, I have explain'd some crimes That I have noted in these present times. Then though I have by some beene counted idle, This shewes I have not given Time the bridle To runne away unmannag'd; but did use it Then best; when I most seemed to abuse it. Here sinfull man thou maist behold in part Thy miserable estate and what thou art. Thy Passions; thy vanities here see, In part (I say) for all there cannot be: Thy waverings and thy frailties I've explain'd, With thy presumption and have nothing fain'd. If thou hast read it then I hope thou know'st, Though thou seem'st bad, thou worse art then thou show'st And I doe trust thy wretchednesse espide, Will quell thy most intolerable pride. I mus'd a while thou wert so prone to sinning, But 'twas thy fault I see from the beginning: And as the Lord himselfe once said, so still, Th' imaginations of thy heart are ill. That's one maine cause; then to performe an evill, Thou hast the pronenesse of the flesh; the Divell; With bad examples for thy instigation; Besides in ill the Worlds rash approbation. But yet would I not have thee think (oh man!) That I with Tymon the Athenian, Desire to make thee so much feele: by woe, To goe and hang thy selfe; I meane not so, Nor seeke to drive thee thereby to despaire, 'Tis not my purpose my intent's more faire. This I would have thee doe, sith flesh is fraile, And Satan will be busie to prevaile, With heed and care watch over thy affection, And in thy doings follow this direction. First, see if't be thy flesh that mooves thee to Those things thou art so oft about to do. Next, to consider well it doth behove thee, What kind of men they are that doe approve thee. For true it is, (as I have oft beene taught) What flesh desires and most approves is naught. And sith to thrust thee forward unto evill, Thou hast an ill heart, proud flesh, and the devill, With bad example; learne (oh man) to season Thy heart with sacred thoughts, with truth and reason Thy flesh with labour, and with fasting, tame, And 'twill not be so subject unto blame. Prevent the divels baits and his temptations With earnest prayers and good Meditations: And see thou heed to thy companions giv'st, Sith thou wilt be as those with whom thou liv'st; Yea, sith thou art so subject unto sin, Shun all occasions that may draw thee in. So when thy God shall see thou hast a will, And truly dost desire to mend what's ill; He will accept it (for his sonnes deere sake) And thee more willing and more able make. Yea, should thy sinnes more red than scarlet grow, Yet he would make them whiter than the snow. Thy now black soule (were it thrice more defil'd) As innocent as is the new-borne child: And thy most miserable body farre More glorious than is the brightest Starre. But if thou, without care or heed, dost leane Vnto those lusts of flesh that are uncleane, If thou take pleasure and delight to doe them, Quite giving over thy desires unto them, They both in soule and body too, will make thee So foule a Leper that God will forsake thee; His holy Angels and his Saints abhorre thee, And onely devils make entreaty for thee; Yea, thou shalt in Gehynnon, waile with them, That are excluded new Ierusalem. The end of the second Book. The Scourge. My Muse, I purpos'd to have rested here; And so she should indeed but that I feare A gentle warning will not now suffice, To make men leave off their iniquities: Yea, I doe know their negligence so great, 'Tis not enough we should perswade, or threat, And therefore I'me resolved ere I part, To give them a remembrance to their smart. And though full loth (cause their ill natures urge) I'l send abroad a Satyr with a scourge; That to their shame for this Abuse shall strip them, And being naked in their vices whip them. And to be sure of those that are most rash, Not one shall scape him that deserves the lash. But some will kick. Yea, let them kick and spare not So he may come to jerke them well I care not; For be they rich, or poore, or weake, or strong, I'l make him finde them that delight in wrong. Not in despight to make revengefull rumours; Rather in sport to mocke the worlds base humors. But lest I make my Prologue overlarge, I'l let my whipping Satyr know his charge. First, though we have but little manners got, Bred in the woods, where many use them not, He shall be sent to over-looke the Court, And dance the Witch, and make the King some sport. Doe Satyr, goe; thou shalt not be disdain'd; Love without merit hath beene entertian'd And so may thine; that Progenie's the most, Yea, all indeed of which the world can boast: And that so worthy ('tis a wondrous matter) Commend it how thou wilt, thou canst not flatter. If thou maist get their favour that be best, There is no cause why thou should'st feare the rest: The good will helpe, but never hurt. Then care not Although the wicked world offend, they dare not. First, lash the Great-ones; but if thou be wise, In generall and doe not speciallize: Yet if thou doe, so wisely let it be, None may except but those that faulty be. Now peradventure, some will rage or storme; But that's no matter, thou art freely borne: And though their eies sparke fire, and they look big, Be thou as sterne, thou need'st not care a fig; And tell them plainely 'tis not all their show, Can make men think them better than they know: 'Tis not great words, nor yet a large possession, Shall free them from the scandall of oppression; Though they can now, to get themselves a name, Build Babel up a-new; and quickly frame Such lofty Palaces, as if they meant To threaten heaven from the battlement. Who wonders at it? none I thinke, and why? Who is so mad to tell them that? not I, Yet Satyr, looke that thou before thou part, Give them one jerke to make their Honours smart. Their stately houses, say, are things but vaine, An Age or two, shall rot them downe againe, And for their vice, if there be none dare show it, Say I have vow'd to make the world to know it. Then 'tis not tombes, nor yet a heape of stones, Shall make men thinke the better of their bones: No, it shall speake their avarice and pride, Which those they scorn'd &amp; wrongd shal then deride. So let them goe their soveraigne to attend, And those that be not at the best, amend. Search on for more, but if thou hap to finde Any among them of the female kind, Women or Angels, bad or good, thine eies Shall not looke toward their infirmities. What ere some say no woman will or can Wrong him (I'l warrant) that's an honest man. For they are good and surely would be still Were't not that men did often make them ill: Those that are angry with them let them show it, I'l say th' are vertuous, for because I know it. Mens faults I tell: so may he womans too That's plagu'd by whores, with whom he had to doe These if thou hap to see I charge thee skip, And search in every office with thy whip; There, there are those that for their private store, Make both th' Exchequer, and the Commons poore, Extortion doth maintaine their bravery; Yet lay not open all their knavery: But tell them they a new account must bring; That lash perhaps their guilty soules will sting. Thou shalt in Court another troope espie Such as in show are full of honesty; Faire tongu'd; but he that such fine followers wants Is happy; for they are but Sycophants, Dissembling villaines doe but note them well, And thou wilt say they are the brood of hell. For pluck away their fain'd fidelity, And they are e'en a heape of villany: To make them smart these words to them commend That beggery and shame shall be their end. Yet thou shalt finde depending on the Court, Some that will jest to make their betters sport: But sift them (I durst pawne a brace of testers) If truth were known, they are more fools than Iesters And so they are suppos'd; although indeed, They are more knaves than fools: but take thou heed Come not within the compasse of their bable, Then call them knaves as lowd as thou art able. If thou come thither at some publike show, (As there thou shalt be whether they will or no) Remember that thou make a shift to creepe Neere to the place where they their revels keep. There stand a while unseene, and doe no more, But note those fellowes that doe keepe the doore, If thou perceive some, as some will do then, Keep out a many worthy Gentlemen, And let a Laundresse or a scoundrell passe, Give him a jerke, and tell him he's an Asse. But lest thou spie what may make thee asham'd: (Or speake of that for which thou maist be blam'd) Leave thou the Court, if thine owne selfe thou pitty, And come a while to walke about the Citie. As soone as there thou entrest, thou shalt meet, Great store of Gallants passing out the street. A part from dice, or Fence, or dancing come, And peradventure from a whore-house some: These are good fellowes that will frankely spend, While lands doe last, or any man will lend: And yet to see (more fooles the world had never) They are so proud as if 'twould last for ever. And though these lightly cannot have a worse, Or deadlier sicknesse than an empty purse, Which will ensue; yet tell them they must meet, At the Kings-bench, the Counters or the Fleet. Then step unto the Lawyers: peradventure They'l by some Writ command thee not to enter, Yet feare them not; but looke and thou shalt spie Vnder their gownes a masse of knavery. Pluck off the maske of Law, that cloaks their drifts, And thou shalt see a world of lawlesse shifts. But tell them there's a Iudge wil not be feed: And that perhaps will make their conscience bleed. Then tell the Scriveners as thou passest by, That they were best to leave their forgery, Or else why is't their eares doe scape so well? The devill meanes to beare them whole to hell. Tell the Physitians (if thou meet with any) Their potions and their drugs have murther'd many. For which thou would'st have lasht but dost delay th? Because the Devill meanes to pay them: But if they'l proove conclusions bid them then, Try't on themselves, and not on other men. Desire the Brokers that they would not yawne After the forfeit of anothers pawne. It is their right by law they'l say, 'tis true; And so's their soule, perhaps anothers due, But sting them; if their conscience quite be fled, Then shall they pay, what they have forfeited. Entreat the Taylor next, if that he can, To leave his theft and prove an honest man. And if he thinke the matter be too hard, Knock him about the noddle with his yard. If he be rich and take the same in snuffe Tell him his substance is but stollen stuffe: And that the Iay would hardly brook the weather, If every bird should take away her feather. So having whipt him, let the Priest go shrieve him, And (if he have authority) forgive him. Go warn the Crafts-man that he do not lurk All day at Ale-house, and neglect his work: And then survey the ware of every Trade, For much (I tell thee) is deceitful made. Which if thou finde, I charge thee do not friend it, But call him knave, and bid him go and mend it. Oh, see if thou the Merchant-man canst finde, For hee'l be gone at turning of the winde: Bid him keep touch, or tell his worship how His heart will tremble when the Seas are rough: Desire him too, if he do travell thither Where conscience is, that he wold bring some hither; Heer's little, some will have it; if none will, He shall gain by it, though he keep it still, If he bring none, 'twere charity I think, To pray some storm may make his vessell sink. Look in the Ships, for I have known deceit Hath been in both the owner and the freight; Yea note them well, and thou shalt finde their books Are Woodcocks-gins, and barbed-fishing-hooks: But he thereby great store of wealth obtains, And cares not how, so he increase his gains: Yet lest his riches hap to make him proud, Satyr, I pray thee tell him this aloud To make him smart; That whilst he like a Mome Plaies fast abroad, his wise plaies loose at home: Nor shall his ill-got masse of wealth hold out, But he or his, become a banquerout. Now to thy rest, 'tis night. But here approaches A troope with torches, hurried in their coaches. Stay and behold, what are they? I can tell, Some bound for Shorditch or for Clarken-well: Oh these are they which thinke that Fornication, Is but a youthfull, sportfull, recreation: These to hold out the game, maintaine the back, With Marrow-pies, Potato-roots and Sack: And when that Nature hath consum'd her part, Can hold out a luxurious course by Art: Goe, stop the horses quickly (least thou misse) And tell the Coachmans wanton carriage this, They of their guide must be advised well, For they are running downe the hill to hell. Their venery, will soone consume their stocks, And bring them to repentance with a pocks. For other crimes committed without light, Let such reveale as see like Owles by night: For many men a secret fault can finde, But in apparant rogueries are blinde, Or else they will not see, but thou wert best Leave whipping and betake thee to thy rest. If in an Inne it be, before thou sup, Will that the Tapster call his Master up, And bid him kindly, sith there lodge thou must, To use plain dealing like an honest Host. Dissemblings naught, hard reckonings they are worse; Light gaines (they say) will make a heavy purse. And let him not (a fault with many rife) For base advantage prostitute his wife; For many men (who are not as they should be) Doe make their wives more wanton than they would be. Thereby they gaine, their Innes are ill frequented; But such ill courses are too late repented. So schoole him well, but doe thy whip refraine, And send him to his other guests againe. Then thou shalt see the nimble Tapster fly, Still yauling, Here, anon sir, by and by. So diligent that time more known must make him, Or for an honest man thou wilt mistake him, His best revenue is by nick and froth; Which priviledge to lose he would be loth. And there's an old shift (if they leave it not) There must be something added to the shot. But wilt thou swagger with him for it? No: But take him as he is, and let him goe. Now for most Hostlers, if you hap to try them; Knaves thou maist say they are, and not belie them, For they deceive the poore dumbe travelling beast, And for the fame deserve a jerke at least; Yet doe thou spare them for there is no doubt Some guest will find a time to pay the Lout. Well having rested, and discharg'd thine Host, I'l send thee downe into the Country, post: For I have businesse, no man would beleeve, With whom d'ye think? e'en with the under-Shrieve. Tell him thou heardst (and that's a fault indeed) That in some causes he is double-fee'd. And that moreover he deserves a portion With those that are indited for extortion; Yea and for other things as well as that. Tell him the Country termes him, he knowes what: Whereat if thou perceive, he make a sport Thou whip him shalt, till he be sorry for't. Say to our Knights; their much formality, Hath made them leave their hospitality: And say (although they angry be therefore) That many of themselves are not onely poore, But that they have too (or they are belide) Quite begger'd their posterity with pride. And sith thou art so neere them; doe not cease Vntill thou see our Iustices of peace: There try if thou canst get but so much favour, To binde the Country to the good behaviour. And tell them how thou hast informed beene, That they have granted Warrant upon spleene; Are partiall, and have over sway'd by might The poore mans cause that's innocent and right: If this thou finde be true, thou hast permission To lash or put them out of the commission. The Constable, if he were bid, I wisse, Be good in's office twere not much amisse: For he, they say, a many meanes may have If so he be dispos'd to play the knave; See how he deales, and make thy message known, For he hath stocks and whipping posts of's own. There are Church-wardens too, I shame to see How they run into wilfull perjurie. Partly in favour and in part for feare, They wink at much disorder in a yeare: But if thou hap to take them in the lurch, Ierke them, as evill members of the Church. If they reply, offenders are so friended Though they present, 'tis little thing amended: Yet tell them 'tis their duty to discharge Their consciences in every thing at large; Which if they doe, ill doers shall be sham'd, Or the corrupted visitors be blam'd. And prethee tell the B. Chancellors That thou art sent to be their counsellors And will them if they meane not to be stript, And to be once againe like schooleboies whipt, Their worships should not so corrupted be, To hinder Iustice for a scurvy fee. Then next goe tell their reverend good Masters, That thou and they are like to fall to wasters: Faith thou shalt finde their Doctorships perhaps, Disputing of their Surplesses and Caps, About the holy Crosse, a Gown, a Hood, Or some such matter for the Churches good, But tell them, there are other things to do, A great deale fitter to be look't into; And if they please to goe their Visitation, There's weightier matters looke for reformation. Yea, say there's many an infirmity Which they both may, and ought to remedy: But touch them with remembrance of their place, And they perhaps will alter then the case. Then bid those Dunces in our Colledges, That they provide them good Apologies, For 'tis reported lately they have both Betooke themselves to venery and sloth, And seeke not learning onely, as they should, But are back-friends to many a man that would 'Twere fit they made a publike recantation, And were well whipt before a Congregation. So leaving them their wits for to refine, Thou shalt be bold to looke on the Divine; They say, he's grown more carefull of his stock, Of profits and of tithes, than of his flock: Now if thou finde report hath not beli'd him, With good respect unto his Calling, chide him. I had almost forgot our civill Doctors; I pray thee warne them and their lazie Proctors, They would not use to make so many pauses, Before they doe determine poore mens causes, And let them not suppose their fees are small, Sith they at last will get the Divell and all. There be Court Barons, many in thy way, Thus maist thou to the Steward of them say; Their policie in raising fines and rents, Hath put poore men besides their Tenements: And tell them (let them answer if they can) Their false Court-roles have undone many a man. Say thou hast seene what to their place belong'd; And knowst oft times both Lord and tenants wrongd Yet spare thy whip, for why? the Peoples curse Already hath prepared them a worse. So when thou thus hast punisht vices slaves, And roundly jerkt the Country petty knaves, Then march thou to the Campe, and tell thou there The lusty ruffling shuffling Cavaliere, (Whose hardned heart can brooke to rob and spill His friend or foe; to ruine, wound or kill) That he will one day finde a misery Will dog him to revenge his cruelty: And see that thou the ruffians courage quaile, Or lash him till the stocke and whip-coard faile. Walke but the Round, and thou maist hap to catch The carelesse souldiers sleeping in their watch; Or in a march, perhaps they'l goe astray: But if thou see them out of their array, And without leave and warrant roming out, To fetch some desperate booty thereabout, Remember them; and for their stout bravado's, See thou reward them with sound bastinado's. Then bid the Captaines in their Garisons, Not lay to pawne their rich Caparisons, Nor run upon the score till they are forc'd, To be disarm'd for payment, or unhors'd, Nor keepe the Souldiers hire, lest they be faine To make an insurrection, or complaine. For that indeed proves often times the cause They doe so much transgresse the Martiall lawes. Yea, tell them 'tis a scandall to be drunke, And drown their valour; or maintaine a Punke. Then if they mend it not, to blot their fame, In stead of honour, whip them for't with shame. Lustly, there are some selfe-conceited wits, Whose stomack's nought, but their own humor fits; Detracting Criticks; who e'en at the best, Doe bite with envy, or else snarle at least: And in thy progresse if discern'd thou be, 'Tis out of question they will snap at thee. To spight them then, the way's not to out-brawle them: But say thou car'st not, and that lash will gaule them. Now Satyr, leave me to my selfe alone; Thou hast thy message, and thou maist be gone: Whip any that shall offer to withstand thee In executing that which I command thee. And yet, (so ho, ho, ho,) come backe againe, Be sure that thou doe understand me plaine. First note; I from my scourge doe here except The guard by whom the kingdomes peace is kept, The vertuous Peers know that I nothing grutch them And on my blessing see thou doe not touch them. And if in all our Offices there's any That is an honest man, among so many, Him did I ever meane that thou should'st spare; Because I know that such an one is rare. Physicke and Law I honour (as 'tis fit,) With every vertuous man professing it; I doe not aime at such as they: Nor when I stout our Gallants, meane I Gentlemen, That well and decently maintained be According to their fashion and degree: No, those I love; and what can I lesse doe, Sith I of them am well-beloved too? To blame all Merchants, never was my will Nor doe I think all Tradesmens worke is ill: My meaning must not so be understood; For the last shooes I had, were very good. Yea, and so farre am I from such a thought Thou should'st against the Vertuous doe ought: That if thou but an honest Tapster see, Tell him I wish we might acquainted be; And I'l that Hostler love, which in amends Will use my horse well, that we may be friends. And to be briefe; good Satyr understand, That thou maist not mistake what I command: 'Tis not my meaning, neither doe I like That thou at this time should'st in speciall strike: Because my hatred might appeare as then, Not to the vice, but rather to the men. Which is not so; for though some malice me, With every one I am in charity. And if that thou doe ever come to sight, And bring thy yet concealed charge to light; I wish it might be tooke as 'twas intended, And then no vertuous man will be offended. But if that any man will thinke amisse, Vpon my life that party guilty is: And therefore lash him. So, get th' out of dore; Come what come will, I'l call thee backe no more. Well, now he's gone the way that I direct him, And goe he shall how ere the world respect him: If any mervaile why he was not bolder, Perhaps he may be when that he is older: He hath too smooth a chin, a looke too milde, A token that he is not wholly wilde; But may I reach the yeeres of other men, If this loose world be not amended then, I'l send a Satyr rougher than a Beare, That shall not chide and whip, but scratch and teare: And so I'l teach him, he shall be too strong. For all your Paris-garden dogs to wrong. This Satyr hath a Scourge, (but it wants weight: Your Spanish whips were worse in eighty-eight) That, shall not onely make them howle for paine, But touse them till they hold their peace againe. Now, if the world doe frowne upon me for't: Shall I be sorry? No, 'twill mend my sport; But what if I my selfe should hap to stray Out of my bounds into my Satyrs way? Why then; (and that's as much as I need do) I'l give him leave to come and lash me too. So now my Muse a resting time requires, For shees o'er-wearied and her spirit tires. ??????? ???? ???. FINIS. Certaine Epigrams to the Kings most excellent Maiestie, the Queen, the Prince, the Princesse, and other Noble and Honourable Personages, and Friends; to whom the Author gave many of his Books. To the Kings Maiestie. Epigram 1. Lo here dread Soveraign and great Britains King First, to thy view, I have presum'd to bring These my Essaies; on which but gently looke, I doe not make thee Patron of my Book, For 'tis not sit our Faiths Defender (still) Take the protection of each trifling quill. No, yet because thy wisdome able is Of all things to make use, I give thee this: The picture of a beast in Humane shape; 'Tis neither Monkey nor Baboone, nor Ape, Though neere condition'd. I have not sought it In Affrick Desarts, neither have I brought it Out of Ignota terra, those wilde lands Beyond the farthest Magellanick strands Yeeld not the like; the Fiend lives in this Ile, And I much mus'd thou spi'dst not all this while That man-like Monster. But (alas!) I saw, The looke of Majesty kept him in awe: He will not, (for he dares not) before thee Shew what (indeed) it is his use to be. But in thy presence he is meeke, demure, Devout, chaste, honest, innocent and pure: (Seeming an Angel, free from thought of ill,) And therefore thou must needs so thinke him still. But, for because thy Soveraigne place denies The sight of what is view'd by meaner eies, This I have brought thee with much care and paine: 'Twas like to have beene forced backe againe. So loth the world was that thine eie should view The portraiture that I have drawne so true: Yea, yet (I feare) she findes her selfe so gal'd, That some will studie how to hav't recal'd: But 'tis too late; for now my Muse doth trust. When thou hast seen't, thou wilt approve what's just. And if I may but once perceive, or heare, That this sounds pleasing in thy Kingly eare, I'l make my Muses to describe him fuller, And paint him forth in a more lively colour. Yea I will to the worlds great shame unfold That which is knowne, but never yet was told. Mean-while, great King, a happy Monarch raigne, Inspight of Rome, the Divell, Hell and Spaine. Another to his Maiestie. Epigram 2. As he that feeds on no worse meat than Quailes, And with choice dainties pleaseth appetite, Will never have great lust to gnaw his nailes, Or in a course thin diet take delight: So thou great King, that still dost over-looke The learned works that are most deep, most rare, Canst not perhaps my ruder Satyrs brooke, Nor dost thou for such sharp-fangd criticks care. Oh doe not yet thy selfe so much estrange From wonted courtesie to others showne, A Country dish doth often serve for change; And something here is worthy to be knowne. Sharpe sauce gives sweetest meat a better taste, And though that this to many bitter be, Thou no such sicknesse in thy stomack hast, And therefore 'twill be pleasing unto thee. What though I neither flatter, fawne, nor sooth, My honest plainnesse shall more truly praise thee, Than those that in Court-language filed smooth Strive unbeleeved Tropheis for to raise thee; My loyall heart cannot so well impart The love it beares your Majesty as others: The want of Time Encouragement and Art, My purpose in the Embrio still smothers. Obscurity, crosse-fates, and want of means, Would have made Romes great Maro harshly sing, But if once CÃ¦sar to his musick leans, His tunes through all the world will sweetly ring. And this made English wits, late famous grown, Eliza's princely hand did oft peruse Their well-tun'd Poem's; and her bounty shown And that gives light and life to every Muse. Oh! had I such a Star for Pole to mine, I'de reach a Straine should ravish all the Nine. To the Queens Majestie. Epigram 3. Daughter, Wife, Sister, Mother to a King, And Empresse of the North, enrich thy Name: Yet thou dost chastity and wisedome bring, Beauty and bounty to make up thy fame. Which sith (fair Queen) my Muse hath understood, She's bold into thy presence to intrude; Assured, honest meanings that are good Shall finde acceptance there, though they seem rude. Look and behold the Vanities of Men, Their Miseries, their Weaknesse, &amp; their Pride, And when described by my rurall Pen, Thou each particular hast here espide: Think with thy selfe how blest thy Fortunes be T'enjoy so rare a Prince, that both knows how To keep himselfe from such fell Passion free, And make so many mad wilde creatures bow: Indeed her's Vices tablet plainly drawn; Not veiled over, or obscurely drawn; 'Tis in a colour which shall never fade, That men may blush on such a Hag to fawn. But if your Grace will favour what I sing, Though Vertue be in durance, I'll repreeve her, That now-despised Nymph to honour bring, Set all her hidden beauties forth; and give her So sweet a look, and such a deft attyre, Men shal grow love-sick, and burn with desire. To Charles, Prince of Wales. Epigram 4. See here fair Off-spring of the Royall Stem, What all the world almost is subject to; Behold it so, thou truely maist contemne, And from thy heart abhorre what others do; Now is the fit and onely time to season That young rare-understanding breast of thine With sacred precepts, good advice and reason. But there's no doubt thou wilt to good incline: Inheritance, great Prince, will make it thine, And were Mans nature yet more prone to fall, So to be born and taught would help it all. To the Princesse. Epigram 5. Sweet Princesse, tho my Muse sing not the glories Of far advent'rous Knights, or Ladies loves Though here be no Encomiastick stories, That tender hearts to gentle pitty moves: Yet in an honest homely Rustick strain, She lims such Creatures as may you ne'er know. Forgive her, though she be severe or plain, Truth, that may warrant it, commanded so. Yea, view it over with beliefe, but then I am afraid you will abhorre a man. And yet you need not; all deserve not blame, For that great Prince that woeth to be yours, (If that his worth but equalize his fame) Is free from any Satyr here of ours. Nay, they shal praise him; for though they have whips To make the wicked their offences rue, And dare to scourge the greatest when he trips, Vertue shall still be certain of her due. But for your sake (if that you entertain him) Oh, would he were a man as I could fain him. Yet sweet Elizabeth; that happy name, If wee lost nothing else by losing thee, So deare to England is, we are too blame If without tears and sighs we parted be: But if thou must make blest another Clime, Remember Our: and for that though I use A crabbed subject and a churlish rime, Deigne but to be the Mistrisse of my Muse; And I'll change Theames, and in a lofty stile Keep thee alive for ever in this Ile. To the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable Privie-Councell. Epigram 6. Most honour'd Lords; I here present this Book To your grave Censures, not to shew my Art: N'er did you on so rude a matter look; Yet 'tis the token of an honest heart. I did it not to please or flatter any, Nor have I made it for the thirst of gain; For I am sure it will not humour many, And I expect much hatred for my pain. Here something you may see that now requires Your care and providence to hav't amended: That is the height, to which my Muse aspires, And whereto I have all my labour tended. It may be there be some out of their hate Will mis-interpret what is plainly meant; Or taxe me as too saucy with the State, In hope to make me for the truth be shent: Yet know, Great Lords, I do acknowledge here, It is your wisedomes that next God maintains This Kingdomes good. And from my heart I beare A reverent respect unto your pains. I do not, as such fain would have it seem, Presume to teach your wisedomes what is best; I do not my own knowledge so esteem: Vile self-conceit I (from my heart) detest. But for because I know the piercing'st eye Can never into all abuses see: And sith the greatest in authoritie May not behold sometime so much as wee: What therefore I have thought to be amisse, And worth amending I have told it here: I know your Honours will be pleas'd in this, Though some (it may be) cannot rage forbeare. But if there's any take this writing badly, Had it told all, it would have vext him madly. To Henry Earl of South-hampton. Epigram 7. South-hampton, sith thy Province brought me forth And on those pleasant mountains I yet keep, I ought to be no stranger to thy worth, Nor let thy vertues in oblivion sleep. Nor will I, if my fortunes give me time: Mean while read this, and see what others bee. If thou canst lik't, and wilt but grace my Rime, I will so blaze thy Hampshire Springs and Thee, Thy Arle, Test, Stowre, and Avon shall share Fame Either with Humber, Severn, Trent, or Thame. To William, Earl of Pembroke. Epigram 8. Thou whom no private ends can make unjust, (True noble Spirit, free from hate or guile) Thou, whom thy Prince for thy great care and trust Hath plac'd to keep the entrance of this Ile. See here th' Abuses of these wicked times; I have expos'd them open to thy view Thy judgement is not blinded with like crimes, And therefore maist perceive that all is true. Take't; for though I seem a stranger, I know thee; And for thy vertues (Pembroke) this I owe thee. To the Lord Lisle, Lord Chamberlain to the Queen. Epigram 9. A Sidney being, and so nere alli'd To him whose matchlesse rare immortall Pen Procur'd of Fame to have him deifi'd, And live for ever in the hearts of men: The love my soule hath ever born that name, Would certainly perswade me for your sake, In honest service to adventure blame, Or any open dangers undertake: Yet shall not that, your titles, nor your place, Your honours, nor your might, nor all you have, Cause me to flatter for regard or grace, Fortune shall never make my minde a slave. But seeing that your vertue shines apparant, And honourable acts do speak your praise: Sith Good-report hath given forth her warrant, Which none (so much as by himselfe) gain-saies That (and nought else but that) compells my Muse To sing your worth, and to present her own. If this imperfect issue you'l peruse, I'll make her in a better form be known, And teach her that is now so rude and plain, To sore a pitch above the common strain. To the Lady Mary Wroth. Epigram 10. Madame, to call you best, or the most faire, The vertu'st and the Wisest in our daies, Is now not commendations worth a haire, For that's become to be each huswives praise. There's no degree below Superlative Will serve some soothing Epigrammatists: The Worst they praise exceeds Comparative, And Best can get no more out of their fists. But Arts sweet Lover (unto whom I know, There is no happy Muse this day remains, That doth not to your worth and service owe, At least the best and sweetest of his strains) Vouchsafe to let this Book your favour finde: And as I here have Mans abuses shown; Those Muses unto whom you are inclin'd, Shall make your worth and vertues so well known: While others false praise shall in one's mouth be, All shall commend you in the high'st degree. To the Lord Ridgevvay. Sir, you first grac'd and gratifi'd my Muse, Which ne'er durst trie till th? what she could do: That which I did, unto my selfe was news, A matter I was little us'd unto: Had you those first endeavours not approv'd, Perhaps I had for ever silence kept; But now your good encouragement hath mov'd, And rouz'd my Spirits that before time slept; For which I vow'd a gift that should be better, Accept this for't, and Ile be still your debter. Here you shall see the Images of Men More savage than the wildest Irish kern: Abuses whipt and stript, and whipt agen; I know your judgement can the truth discerne. Now so you well will think of this my Rime, I've such a minde yet to Saint Patricks Ile, That if my Fate and Fortunes give me time; I purpose to revisite you a while, And make those sparks of honour to flame high That rak'd up in oblivions cinders lie. To his Father. Epigram 12. Others may glory that their Fathers hands Have scrap'd together mighty sums of gold, Boast in the circuit of new purchast lands, Or heards of cattell more than can be told. God give them joy, their wealth Ile ne'er envy, For you have gotten me a greater store, And though I have not their prosperity, In my conceit I am not halfe so poore. You learn'd me with a little to content me, Shew'd how to bridle passion in some measure; And through your meanes I have a Talent lent me, Which I more value than all Indies treasure. For, when the almost boundlesse Patrimonies Are wasted; those by which our Great-ones trust To be eterniz'd; when their braveries Shall be forgotten, and their Tombes be dust; Then to the glory of your future line, Your own and my friends sacred memorie, This little poore despised wealth of mine Shall raise a Trophee of Eternitie; Which fretting Envy, not consuming Time, Shall e'er abolish or one whit offend; A toplesse Statue that to Starres shall climbe, Such fortune shall my honest minde attend. But I must needs confesse, 'tis true, I yet Reap little profit in the eies of men. My Talent yeelds small outward benefit, Yet I'le not leave it for the world agen. Though't bring no gain that you by artfull sleight Can measure out the earth in part, or whole, Sound out the Centers depth, and take the height Either of th' Artick or Antartick Pole; Yet 'tis your pleasure, it contentment brings; And so my Muse is my content and joy: I would not misse her to be rank'd with Kings, How-ever some account it as a toy. But having then (and by your means) obtain'd So rich a Patrimonie for my share, (For which with links of love I'me ever chain'd) What duties fitting for such bounties are. Moreover, Nature brought me in your debt, And still I owe you for your cares and fears: Your pains and charges I do not forget, Besides the interest of many yeares. What way is there to make requitall for it, Much I shall leave unpaid do what I can: Should I be then unthankfull, I abhor it, The will may serve when power wants in man, This book I give you then, here you shall finde Somewhat to countervaile your former cost: It is a little Index of my minde; Time spent in reading it will not be lost. Accept it, and when I have to my might Paid all I can to you; if Powers Divine Shall so much in my happinesse delight, To make you Grandsire to a Sonne of mine; Look what remains, and may by right be due, I'll pay it him, as 'twas receiv'd from you. Your loving Sonne, George Wither. To his Mother. Epigram 13. Vngratefull is the childe that can forget The Mothers many pains, her cares, her feares, And therefore, though I cannot pay the debt Due for the smallest drop of your kinde teares; This Book I for acknowledgement do give you, Wherein you may perceive my heart and minde; Let never false report of me more grieve you, And you shall sure no just occasion finde. Love made you apt to feare those slanders true, Which in my absence were but lately sown; It was a motherly distrust in you, But those that rais'd them are false villains known. For though I must confesse I am indeed The vilest to my selfe that lives this time; Yet to the world-ward I have tane such heed, There's none can spot me with a haynous crime. This I am forc'd to speak, you best know why; And I dare strike him that dare say I lye? To his deare Friend, Mr. Thomas Cranly. Epigram 14. Brother, for so I call thee, not because Thou wert my Fathers or my Mothers sonne; Not consanguinity, nor wedlock laws, Could such a kindred twixt us have begun: We are not of one bloud, nor yet name neither, Nor sworn in brotherhood with Alehouse quarts; We never were so much as drunk together, 'Twas no such sleight acquaintance joyn'd our hearts; But a long knowledge with much trial did it; Which are to chuse a friend the best directions) And though we lov'd both well, at first both hid it, Till 'twas discover'd by alike affections. Since which thou hast o'er-gone me far in shewing The office of a Friend. Do so and spare not: (Lo here's a Memorandum for what's owing;) But know, for all thy kind respect I care not Vnlesse thou'lt shew how I may service do thee, Then I will sweare I am beholding to thee. Thine G. W. To his loving Friend and Cousen-German, Mr. William Wither. Epigram 15. If that the Standerds of the house bewray What Fortunes to the owners may betide; Or if their destinies, as some men say, Be in the names of any signifi'd, 'Tis so in thine: for that faire antique Shield Born by thy Predecessors long agoe, Depainted with a cleare pure Argent field, The innocencie of thy line did show. Three sable Crescents with a Cheveron gul'd: Tells that black fates obscur'd our houses light; Because the Planet that our fortunes rul'd, Lost her own lustre, and was darkned quite: And as indeed our adversaries say, The very name of Wither shews decay. But yet despaire not, keep thy white unstain'd, And then it skills not what thy Crescents be. What thogh the Moon be now increas'd, now wan'd! Learne thence to know thy lives inconstancie; Be carefull as thou hitherto hast bin To shun th' abuses man is tax'd for here: And then that brightnesse, now eclips'd with sin, When Moon and Sun are darkned shall look cleare: And whatsoe'er thy name may seem to threat, That quality brave things doth promise thee; E'er thou shalt want thy Hare will bring thee meat, And to kill care, her selfe thy make-sport be: Yea, (though yet Envies mists do make them dull) I hope to see the waned Orbes at full. To his School-Master, Mr. Iohn Greaves. Epigram 16. If ever I do wish I may be rich, (As oft perhaps such idle breath I spend) I do it not for any thing so much, As to have wherewithall to pay my Friend. For (trust me) there is nothing grieves me more Than this; that I should still much kindnesse take, And have a fortune (to my minde) so poore, That (though I would) amends I cannot make: Yet, to be still as thankfull as I may; (Sith my estate no better means affords) What I indeed receive, I do repay In willingnesse, in thanks, and gentle words: Then though your love doth well deserve to have Better requitalls than are in my power, Knowing you'l nothing ultra posse crave, Here I have brought you some Essaies of our. You may think much (perhaps) sith there's so many Learn'd Graduats that have your Pupils been; I who am none, and more unfit than any, Should first presume in publike to be seen. But you have heard, those horses in the Teem That with their work are ablest to go through, So forward seldome as blind Bayard seem, Or give so many twiches to the Plough: And so though they may better their intent Is not, perhaps, to foole themselves in print. To the captious Reader. What thou maist say or think now, 'tis no matter; But if thou busily imagine here, Sith most of these are great ones that I flatter; Know, sacred Iustice is to me so deare, Did not their vertues in my thoughts thus raise th?, To get an Empire by them, I'de not praise them. FINIS. Prince HENRIES Obsequies; OR Mournfull Elegies upon his Death. To the Right Honourable ROBERT Lord Sidney of Penshurst, Vicount Lisley, Lord Chamberlain to the Queens Majesty, and L. Governour of Vlushing, and the Castle of Ramekins. George Wither presents these Elegiak-Sonnets, and wisheth double Comfort after his two-fold Sorrow. Anagrams on the name of Sir William Sidney Knight, deceased. Gulielmus Sidneius. En vilis gelidus sum. ?But? E't nil luge, sidus sum. Besides our great and universall care, (Wherein you one of our chiefe sharers are) To adde more griefe unto your griefes begun, Whilest we a Father lost, you lost a Son, Whose haplesse want had more apparent been, But darkned by the Other 'twas unseen, Which well perceiving, loth indeed was I The Memory of one so deare should die: Occasion thereupon I therefore took Thus to present your Honour with this Book. (Vnfained and true mournfull Elegies, And for our Henry my last Obsequies) That he which did your Sons late death obscure, Might be the mean to make his fame endure. But this may but renew your former woe: Indeed and I might well have doubted so, Had not I known that Vertue which did place you Above the Common sort, did also grace you With gifts of minde to make you more excell, And far more able Passions rage to quell. You can and may with moderation moan, For all your comfort is not lost with one: Children you have whose Vertues may renew The comfort of decaying Hopes in you. Praised be God for such great blessings giving, And happy you to have such comforts living. Nor do I think it can be rightly sed You are unhappy in this One that's dead: For notwithstanding his first Anagram Frights, with Behold, now cold and vile I am: Yet in his last he seems more cheerfull far, And joyes, with The English of this Anagram. Soft, mourn not, I am a Star, Oh, great preferment! What could he aspire That was more high, or you could more desire? Well, since his soule in heaven such glory hath, My Love bequeathes his Grave this Epitaph. Epitaph. Here under lies a Sidney: And what then? Dost think here lies but reliques of a man? Know 'tis a Cabinet did once include, Wit, Beauty, Sweetnesse, Court'sie, Fortitude. So let him rest to Memorie still deare, Till his Redeemer in the Clouds appeare. Mean while, accept his will, who meaning plain, Doth neither write for Praise, nor hope of Gain. And now your Tears and private Griefe forbeare, To turne unto our Great and Publike Care. Your Honours true honourer, GEORGE WITHER. To the whole VVorld in generall, and more particularly to the Iles of Great-Britaine and Ireland, &amp;c. Big-swoln with sighs, &amp; almost drown'd in tears, My Muse out of a dying trance up-rears; Who yet not able to expresse her moans, (Instead of better utterance) here grones. And lest my close-breast should her health impaire Is thus amongst you come to take the aire. I need not name the griefs that on her seaze, Th' are known by this beyond th' Antipodes. But to your view some heavy rounds she brings, That you may beare the burthen when she sings: And that's but Woe, which you so high should strain, That heavens high vault might Eccho't back again. Then, though I have not strived to seem witty, Yet read, and reading note, and noting pitty. What though there's others show in this more Art? I have as true, as sorrowfull a heart: What though Opinion give me not a Name, And I was ne'er beholding yet to Fame: Fate would (perhaps) my Muse, as yet unknown, Should first in Sorrows livery be shown. Then be the witnesse of my discontent, And see if griefes have made me Eloquent: For here I mourne for your-our publike losse, And do my penance at the Weeping-crosse. The most sorrowfull, G. W. [Death that by stealth did wound P. Henries heart] Death that by stealth did wound P. Henries heart Is now tane Captive, and doth act the part Of one o'ercome, by being too too fierce, And lies himselfe dead under Henries hearse: He therefore now in heavenly tunes doth sing, Hell, where's thy triumph? Death, where is thy sting? Prince HENRIES Obsequies; OR Mournfull Elegies upon his Death. [Eleg. 1.] Now that beloved Henries glasse is run, And others duties to his body shown; Now that his sad-sad Obsequies be done, And publike sorrows well-nigh over-blown: Now give me leave to leave all joyes at one For a dull melancholy lonelinesse; To pine my selfe with a selfe-pining moan, And fat my griefe with solitarinesse. For if it be a comfort in distresse, (As some think) to have sharers in our woes, Then my desire is to be comfortlesse, My soule in publike griefe no pleasure knows.) Yea, I could wish, and for that wish would die, That there were none had cause to grieve but I. Eleg. 2. [For were there none had cause to grieve but I] For were there none had cause to grieve but I, 'Twould from my Sorrows many sorrows take; And I should mourn but for one misery, Where now for thousands my poore heart doth ake. Bide from me Ioy then, that oft from me bid'st, Be present Care, that often present art: Hide from me Comfort, that at all times hid'st, For I will grieve with a true-grieving heart. Ile glut my selfe with sorrow for the nonce, What though my Reason would the same gain-say! Oh, beare with my unbridled Passion once, I hope it shall not much from Vertue stray, Sith griefe, for such a losse, at such a season, Past measure may be, but not out of reason. Eleg. 3. [What need I for th' infernall Furies hallo?] What need I for th' infernall Furies hallo? Call upon darknesse, and the lonely night? Or summon up Minerva or Apollo, To help me dolefull Elegies endite? Here wants no mention of the fears of Styx, Of black Cocytus, or such fained stuffe; Those may paint out their griefes with forced tricks, That have not in them reall cause enough; I need it not; yet for no private crosse Droopes my sad soule, nor do I mourn for fashion, For why? a generall, a publike losse In me hath kindled a right wofull Passion. Then oh (alas) what need hath he to borrow, That's pinch'd already with a feeling sorrow? Eleg. 4. [First for thy losse, poore World-divided Ile] First for thy losse, poore World-divided Ile, My eyes pay griefs drink-offering of teares: And I set-by all other thoughts awhile, To feed my minde the better on my cares. I saw how happy thou wert but of late In thy sweet Henries hopes, yea, I saw too How thou didst glory in thy blessed state: Which thou indeed hadst cause enough to doe. But when I saw thee place all thy delight Vpon his worth; and then when thou didst place it, (And thy joy almost mounted to her height) His haplesse end so suddenly deface it; Me thought I felt it go so neare my heart, Mine ak'd too with a sympathizing smart. Eleg. 5. [For thee, Great Iames, my springs of sorrow run] For thee, Great Iames, my springs of sorrow run, For thee my Muse a heavy song doth sing, That hast lost more in losing of thy Sonne, Than they that lose the title of a King. Needs must the pains that do disturbe the head Disease the body throughout every part; I therefore should have seem'd a member dead, If I had had no feeling of this smart; But oh, I grieve, and yet I grieve the lesse, Thy Kingly gift so well prevail'd to make him Fit for a Crown of endlesse happinesse, And that it was th' Almighties hand did take him, Who was himselfe a book for Kings to pore on, And might have bin thy ????????? ?????. Eleg. 6. [For our faire Queen my griefe is no lesse moving] For our faire Queen my griefe is no lesse moving, There's none could e'er more justly boast of childe; For he was ev'ry way most nobly loving, Most full of manly courage, and yet milde. Me thinks I see what heavy discontent Beclouds her brow, and over-shades her eyne: Yea, I do feel her loving heart lament, An earnest thought conveys the griefe to mine. I see shee notes the sadnesse of the Court, Thinks how that here or there she saw him last: Remembers his sweet speech, his gracefull sport, And such like things to make her Passion last. But what mean I? let griefe my speeches smother, No tongue can tell the sorrows of the Mother. Eleg. 7. [Nor thine sweet Charles, nor thine Elizabeth] Nor thine sweet Charles, nor thine Elizabeth, Though one of you have gaind a Princedome by't; The griefe he hath to have it by the death Of his sole Brother, makes his heart deny't, Yet let not sorrows black obscuring clowd Quite cover and eclipse all comforts light, Though one fair Star above our height doth shrow'd Let not the earth be left in darknesse quite. Thou Charles art now our hope, God grant it be More certain than our last; we trust it will: Yet we shall have a loving feare of thee, The burned childe the fire much dreadeth still. But God loves his, and what e'er sorrows threat, I one day hope to see him Charles the Great. Eleg. 8. [Then droop not Charles to make our griefes the more] Then droop not Charles to make our griefes the more; God that to scourge us took away thy brother; To comfort us again kept thee in store: And now I think on't, Fate could do no other. Thy Father both a Sunne and PhÅnix is, Prince Henry was a Sunne and PhÅnix too, And if his Orbe had been as high as his, His beams had shone as bright's his Fathers doe. Nature saw this and took him quite away: And now dost thou to be a PhÅnix trie; Well, so thou shalt (no doubt) another day, But then thy Father (Charles) or thou must die. For 'twas decreed when first the world begun, Earth should have but one PhÅnix, heaven one Sun. Eleg. 9. [But shall I not bemone the sad Elector?] But shall I not bemone the sad Elector? Yes, Frederick, I needs must grieve for thee, Thou woest with woe now, but our best Protector Gives joyfull ends where hard beginnings be. Had we no shews to welcome thee to Court? No solemne sight but a sad Funerall? Is all our former masking and our sports Transform'd to sighs? Are all things tragicall? Had'st thou been here at Summer, or at Spring, Thou should'st not then have seen us drooping thus; But now 'tis Autumne that spoiles every thing, Vulgarly tearm'd the Fall o'th Leafe with us. And not amisse; for well may't be the Fall, That brings down blossoms, fruit, leaves, tree &amp; all Eleg. 10. [Then Stranger Prince, if thou neglected seem] Then Stranger Prince, if thou neglected seem, And hast not entertainment to thy state, Our loves yet therefore do not mis-esteem; But lay the fault upon unhappy Fate. Thou foundst us glad of thy arrivall here; And saw'st him whom we lov'd (poore wretched Elves;) Say? did'st thou e'er of one more worthy heare? No, no, and therefore now we hate our selves. We being then of such a Gem bereft, Beare with our Passions; and since one is gone; And thou must have the halfe of what is left; Oh think on us for good when you are gone: And as thou now dost beare one halfe of's name, Help beare out griefe, and share thou all his Fame. Eleg. 11. [See, see, fair Princesse, I but nam'd thee yet] See, see, fair Princesse, I but nam'd thee yet, Meaning thy woes within my breast to smother: But on my thoughts they do so lively beat, As if I heard thee sighing, Oh my Brother: Me thinks I heard thee calling on his name, With plaining on his too ungentle fate: And sure the Sisters were well worthy blame, To shew such spite to one that none did hate, I know thou sometime musest on his face, (Fair as a womans, but more manly-fair.) Sometime upon his shape, his speech, and pase, A thousand waies thy griefes themselves repaire. And oh! no marvell since your sure-pure loves Were nearer, dearer, than the Turtle Doves. Eleg. 12. [How often, oh how often did he vow] How often, oh how often did he vow To grace thy joyfull look'd-for Nuptialls: But oh how wofull, oh how wofull now, Will they be made through these sad Funeralls! All pleasing parlies that betwixt you two, Publike or private have exchanged been, All thou hast heard him promise for to doe. Or by him in his life performed seen, Calls on remembrance; the sweet name of Sister, So oft pronounc'd by him, seems to take place Of Queen &amp; Empresse, now my thoughts do whisper, Those titles one day shall thy vertues grace. If I speak true, for his sweet sake that's dead, Seek how to raise dejected Britains head. Eleg. 13. [Seek how to raise dejected Britains head] Seek how to raise dejected Britains head, So she shall study how to raise up thine And now leave off thy tears in vain to shed, For why? to spare them I have powr'd out mine. Pitty thy selfe, and us, and mournfull Rhine, That hides his fair banks under flouds of griefe, Thy Prince, thy Duke, thy brave Count Palatine, 'Tis time his sorrows should have some reliefe. Hee's come to be another brother to thee, And help thy father to another Sonne: He vows thee all the service love can do thee; And though acquaintance hath with griefe begun. 'Tis but to make you have the better taste Of that true blisse you shall enjoy at last. Eleg. 14. [Thy brother's well, and would not change estates] Thy brother's well, and would not change estates With any Prince that reignes beneath the skie: No, not with all the worlds great Potentates, His plumes have born him to Eternity. He reignes ore Saturn rul'd in the hower of his death. Saturn now that reign'd o're him, He fears no Planets dangerous aspect: But doth above their Constellations clime, And earthly joyes and sorrows both neglect. Wee saw he had his Spring amongst us here, He saw his Sommer, but he skipt it over, And Autumne now hath tane away our Deare, The reason's this which we may plain discover, He shall escape (for so th' Almighty wills) The stormy Winter of ensuing ills. Eleg. 15. [I grieve to see the wofull face o'th' Court] I grieve to see the wofull face o'th' Court, And for each grieved member of the land; I grieve for those that make these griefes their sport, And cannot their own evill understand. I also grieve to see how vices swarme, And vertue as despis'd grow out of date: How they receive most hurt that do least harme, And how poore honest Truth incurreth hate. But more, much more I grieve that we do misse The joy we lately had; and that hee's gone Whose living presence might have helpt all this: His everlasting absence makes me mone. Yea, most I grieve that Britains Hope is fled, And that her Darling brave Prince Henrie's dead. Eleg. 16. [Prince Henrie dead! what voice is that we heare] Prince Henrie dead! what voice is that we heare Am I awake, or dreame I, tell me whether? If this be true, if this be true, my Deare, Why do I stay behinde thee to do either? Alas, my fate compells me; I must bide To share the mischiefs of this present age: I am ordaind to live till I have tri'd The very worst and utmost of their rage. But then why mourn I not to open view? In sable Robes according to the Rites? Why is my hat without a branch of Yeugh? Alas, my minde no complement delights; Because my griefe that Ceremony lothes, Had rather be in heart, than seem in clothes. Eleg. 17. [Thrice happy had I been, if I had kept] Thrice happy had I been, if I had kept Within the circuit of some little Village, In ignorance of Courts and Princes slept, Manuring of an honest halfe-plough tillage: Or else I would I were as young agen As when Eliza our last PhÅnix di'd: My childish yeares had not conceived then What 'twas to lose a Prince so dignifi'd. But now I know: And what now doth't avail? Alas, whilst others merry feel no pain, I melancholy sit alone and wail: Thus sweetest profit yeelds the bitter'st gain. By disobedience we did knowledge get, And sorrow ever since hath followed it. Eleg. 18. [When as the first sad rumour fill'd mine eare] When as the first sad rumour fill'd mine eare Of Henries sicknesse; an amazing terrour Struck through my body with a shuddring feare, Which I expounded but my frailties errour. For though a quick misdoubting of the worst, Seem'd to foretell my soule what would ensue: God will forbid, thought I, that such a curst Or ill presaging thought should fall out true: It cannot sink into imagination, That He whose future glories we may see To be at least all Europes expectation, Should in the prime of age despoiled be; For if a Hope so likely nought avail us, It is no wonder if all other fail us. Eleg. 19. [Again, when one had forc'd unto mine eare] Again, when one had forc'd unto mine eare My Prince was dead; although he much protested, I could not with beliefe his sad news heare, But would have sworn and sworn again he jested. At such a word, me thought, the town should sink, The earth should down unto the Center cleave, Devouring all in her hell-gaping chink, And not so much as Sea or Iland leave. Some Comet, or some monstrous blazing Starre Should have appear'd, or some strange Prodigie, Death might have shown't us, though't had bin afar That he intended some such tyranny. But God (it seemeth) did thereof dislike, To shew that he will on a sudden strike. Eleg. 20. [Thus unbeleeving I did oft enquire] Thus unbeleeving I did oft enquire Of one, of two, of three, and so of many: And still I heard what I did least desire, Yet grounded hope would give no faith to any. Then at the last my heart began to feare, But as I credence to my fears was giving, A voice of comfort I began to heare: Which to my fruitlesse Ioy, said, Henrie's living; At that same word my Hope, that was forsaking My heart, and yeelding wholly to despaire; Revived straight, and better courage taking, Her crazed parts so strongly did repaire. I thought she would have held it out, but vain, For oh, e'er long she lost it quite again. Eleg. 21. [But now my tongue can never make relation] But now my tongue can never make relation, What I sustain'd in my last foughten field; My minde assailed with a three-fold passion, Hope, Feare, Despaire, could unto neither yeeld. Feare willed me to view the skies black colour, Hope said, Vpon his hopefull vertues look; Despaire shew'd me an universall dolour, Yet fruitlesse doubt my hearts possession took: But when I saw the Hearse, then I beleev'd, And then my sorrow was at full, alas: Beside, to shew I had not causelesse griev'd, I was inform'd that he embowel'd was. And 'twas subscrib'd, they found he had no gall, Which I beleev'd, for he was sweetnesse all. Eleg. 22. [Oh cruell and insatiable Death!] Oh cruell and insatiable Death! Would none suffice, would none suffice but hee? What pleasure was it more to stop his breath, Than to have choak'd, or kill'd, or poyson'd me? My life for his, with thrice three millions more, We would have given as a ransome to thee; But since thou in his losse hast made us poore, Foule Tyrant, it shall never honour do thee: For thou hast shown thy selfe a spightfull fiend; Yea, Death, thou didst envie his happy state, And therefore thought'st to bring it to an end; But see, see whereto God hath turn'd thy hate: Thou meant'st to mar the blisse he had before, And by thy spight hast made it ten times more. Eleg. 23. ['Tis true, I know, Death with an equall spurn] 'Tis true, I know, Death with an equall spurn, The lofty Turret, and low Cottage beats: And takes imperially each one in his turn, Yea, though he bribes, praies, promises, or threats. Nor Man, Beast, Plant, nor Sex, Age nor Degree Prevailes against his dead-sure striking hand: For then, e'er we would thus despoiled be, All these conjoyn'd his fury should withstand. But oh! unseen he strikes at unaware, Disguised like a murthering Iesuite: Friends cannot stop him that in presence are; And which is worse, when he hath done his spite, He carries him so far away from hence, None lives that hath the power to fetch him thence. Eleg. 24. [Nor would we now, because we do beleeve] Nor would we now, because we do beleeve, His God (to whom indeed he did belong) To crown him where he hath no cause to grieve, Took him from death that sought to do him wrong. But were this deare-beloved Prince of ours Living in any corner of this All, Though kept by Romes &amp; Mahomets chiefe powers; They should not long detain him there in thrall: We would rake Europe rather, plain the East; Dispeople the whole Earth before the doome: Stamp halfe to powder, and fire all the rest; No craft nor force should him divide us from: We would break down what e'er shold him confine Though 'twere the Alps, or hills of Apenine. Eleg. 25. [But what? shall we go now dispute with God] But what? shall we go now dispute with God, And in our hearts upbraid him that's so just? Let's pray him rather to withdraw his rod, Lest in his wrath he bruise us unto dust. Why should we lay his death to fate, or times? I know there hath no second causes bin, But our loud-crying and abhorred crimes, Nay, I can name the chiefest murth'ring sin: And this it was, how-e'er it hath been hid; Trust not (saith David) trust not to a Prince; Yet we hop'd lesse in God (I feare we did) In jealousie he therefore took him hence. Thus we abuse good things, &amp; throgh our blindnes Have hurt our selves, &amp; kil'd our Prince with kindenesse. Eleg. 26. [Let all the world come and bewail our lot] Let all the world come and bewail our lot, Come Europe, Asia, Affrica, come all: Mourn English, Irish, British, and mourn Scot, For his, (no I mistake it) for our fall. The prop of Vertue and mankindes delight Hath fled the earth, and quite forsaken us: We had but of his excellence a sight, To make our longings like to Tantalus. What seek you in a man that he enjoy'd not? Wer't either gift of body or of spirit; Nay, which is more, What had he, he imploy'd not, To help his Countrey, and her love to merit? But see what high preferment Vertues bring, Hee's of a Servant now become a King. Eleg. 27. [But soft, I mean not here to blaze his praise] But soft, I mean not here to blaze his praise, It is a work too mighty, and requires Many a pen, and many yeares of daies: My humble quill to no such task aspires; Onely I mourn with deep-deep-sighing grones, Yet could I wish the other might be done, Though al the Muses were imploy'd at once, And write as long as Helicon would run; But oh, I feare the Spring's already dry, Or else why flags my lazy Muse so low? Why vent I such dull-sprighted Poesie? Surely 'tis sunk; I lye, it is not so: For how is't likely that should want supplies, When all wee feed it with our weeping eyes? Eleg. 28. [May not I liken London now to Troy] May not I liken London now to Troy, As she was that same day she lost her Hector? When proud Achilles spoil'd her of her joy, (And triumph'd on her losses) being Victor? May not I liken Henry to that Greek, That having a whole world unto his share, Intended other worlds to go and seek? Oh no I may not, they unworthy are. Say, whereto England, whereto then shall I Compare that sweet departed Prince, and thee? That noble King, bewail'd by Ieremie, Of thee (Great Prince) shall the example be. And in our mourning we will equall them Of wofull Iuda and Ierusalem. Eleg. 29. [You that beheld it when the mournfull Train] You that beheld it when the mournfull Train Past by the wall of his forsaken Park, Did not the very Grove seem to complain With a still murmure, and to look more dark? Did not those pleasant walks (oh pleasing then Whilest there hee (healthfull) used to resort) Look like the shades of Death neare some foule den? And that place there where once he kept his Court, Did it not at his parting seem to sink? And all forsake it like a cave of Sprights? Did not the earth beneath his Chariot shrink, As grieved for the losse of our delights? Yea, his dumb steed, that erst for none would tarry, Pac'd slow as if he scarce himselfe could carry. Eleg. 30 [But oh! when it approach'd th' impaled Court] But oh! when it approach'd th' impaled Court, Where Mars himselfe envi'd his future glory And whither he in arms did oft resort; My heart conceived a right Tragick story. Whither, Great Prince, oh, whither dost thou goe? (Me thought the very place thus seem'd to say) Why in black roabs art thou attended so? Do not, oh do not make such hast away. But art thou captive, and in triumph too? Oh me! and worse too, livelesse, breathlesse, dead. How could the Monster-Death this mischiefe doe? Surely the Coward took thee in thy bed. For whilst that thou art arm'd within my list, He dar'd not meet thee like a Martialist. Eleg. 31. [Alas, who now shall grace my Turnaments.] Alas, who now shall grace my Turnaments. Or honour me with deeds of Chivalry? What shall become of all my merriments, My Ceremonies, showes of Heraldry And other Rites? who? who shall now adorn Thy Sisters Nuptialls with so sweet a presence? Wilt thou forsake us, leave us quite forlorne, And of all joy at once make a defeasance? Was this the time pick'd out by destiny? Farewell deare Prince then, sith thou wilt be gone, In spight of death go live eternally, Exempt from sorrow, whilst we mortalls mone: But this ill hap instruct me shall to feare, When we are joyfull'st, there's most sorrow neare. Eleg. 32. [Then as he past along you might espie] Then as he past along you might espie, How the griev'd vulgar that shed many a teare; Cast after an unwilling-parting eye, As loth to lose the sight they held so deare. When they had lost the figure of his face, Then they beheld his Roabs; his Chariot then, Which being hid, their look aim'd at the place, Still longing to behold him once agen: But when he was quite past, and they could finde No object to imploy their sight upon, Sorrow became more busie with the minde, And drew an Army of sad passions on; Which made them so particularly mone, Each amongst thousands seem'd as if alone. Eleg. 33. [And well might we of weakest substance melt] And well might we of weakest substance melt With tender passion for his timelesse end, Sith (as it seem'd) the purer bodies felt Some griefe for this their sweet departed friend; The Sunne wrapt up in clowds of mournfull black, Frown'd as displeas'd with such a hainous deed, And would have staid, or turn'd his horses back, If Nature had not forc'd him on with speed: Yea, and the heavens wept a pearly dew, Like very tears, not so as if it rain'd, His Grandsires Tombes, as if the stones did rue Our wofull losses, were with moisture stain'd: Yea, either 'twas my easie mindes beliefe; Or all things were disposed unto griefe. Eleg. 34. [Black was White-hall. The windows that did shine] Black was White-hall. The windows that did shine, And double-glazed were with beauties bright, Which Sun-like erst did dim the gazers eyne, As if that from within them came the light. Those to my thinking seemed nothing fair, And were obscur'd with wo, as they had been Hung all with sack, or sable-cloth of haire, Griefe was without, and so't appear'd within Great was the multitude, yet quiet tho, As if they were attentive unto sorrow: The very windes did then forbeare to blow, The Time of flight, her stilnesse seem'd to borrow. Yea, all the troop pac'd slow, as loth to rend The earth that should embrace their Lord &amp; friend. Eleg. 35. [Me thought e'er-while I saw Prince Henri's Armes] Me thought e'er-while I saw Prince Henri's Armes Advanc'd above the Capitoll of Rome, And his keen blade, in spight of steele or charmes, Give many mighty enemies their doom; Yea, I had many hopes, but now I see, They are ordain'd to be anothers task, Yet of the Stewards line a branch shall be, T'advance beyond the Alpes his plumed Cask; Then I perhaps that now tune dolefull laies, Amongst their zealous triumphs may presume To sing at least some petty Captains praise: Mean-while I will some other work assume. Or rather, sith my hopefulst Patron's dead, Go to some desart and there hide my head. Eleg. 36. [Had he been but my Prince and wanted all] Had he been but my Prince and wanted all Those ornaments of Vertue that so grac'd him, My love and life had both been at his call, For that his Fortune had above us plac'd him: But his rare hopefulnesse, his flying Fame, His knowledge and his honest policie, His courage much admir'd, his very name, His publike love, and private curtesie: Ioyn'd with religious firmnesse, might have mov'd Pale Envy to have prais'd him, and sure he, Had he been of mean birth had bin belov'd; For trust me his sweet parts so ravish'd me, That if I erre, yet pardon me therefore, I lov'd him as my Prince, as Henry more. Eleg. 37. [Me thought his royall person did fore-tell] Me thought his royall person did fore-tell A Kingly statelinesse, from all pride cleare: His look majestick seemed to compell All men to love him, rather than to feare. And yet though he were ev'ry good mans joy, And the alonely comfort of his own, His very name with terrour did annoy His forraigne foes so farre as he was known. Hell droop'd for feare, the Turkey-Moon look'd pale Spain trembled; and the most tempestuous Sea, (Where Behemoth the Babylonish Whale Keeps all his bloudy and imperious plea) Was swoln with rage for feare heed stop the tide Of her o'er-daring and insulting pride. Eleg. 38. [For amongst divers Vertues rare to finde] For amongst divers Vertues rare to finde, Though many I observ'd, I mark'd none more Than in Religion his firme constant minde, Which I set deep upon Remembrance score. And that made Romists for his fortunes sorry: When therefore they shall heare of this ill hap, Those mints of mischiefes will extreamly glory, That he is caught by him whom none shall scape, Yet boast not Babel, thou insult'st in vain, Thou hast not yet obtain'd the victory, We have a Prince still, and our King doth reigne, So shall his seed and their posterity. For know God that loves his &amp; their good tenders, Will never leave his faith without defenders. Eleg. 39. [Amidst our sacred sports that very season] Amidst our sacred sports that very season, Whilst for our Countrey and beloved Iames, Preserved from that hell-bred Powder-Treason, We rung and sung with shouts and joyfull flames: Me thought upon the sudden I espi'd Romes damned fiends an antick dance begin, The Furies led it that our blisse envi'd, And at our rites the hell-hounds seem'd to grin. How now, thought I! more plots! and with that thought Prince Henry dead, I plainly heard one cry. O Lord (quoth I) now they have that they sought, Yet let not our gladst-day, our sadst-day dye. God seem'd to heare, for he to ease our sorrow, Reviv'd that day, to die again the morrow. Eleg. 40. [But Britain, Britain, tell me, tell me this] But Britain, Britain, tell me, tell me this, What was the reason thy chiefe curse befell So just upon the time of thy chiefe blisse? Dost thou not know it? heare me then, Ile tell: Thou wert not halfe-halfe thankfull for his care And mercy that so well preserved thee; His own he never did so often spare: Yea, he thy Lord himselfe hath served thee: Yet Laodicia thou, nor hot nor cold, Secure and carelesse dost not yet repent, Thou wilt be ever over-daring bold, Till thou hast vengeance upon vengeance hent. But (oh) see how Hypocrisie doth reigne, I villain that am worst do first complain. Eleg. 41. [A foule consuming Pestilence did waste] A foule consuming Pestilence did waste, And lately spoil'd thee, England, to thy terrour; But now, alas, a greater plague thou hast, Because in time thou couldst not see thy error: Hard Frosts thy fields and gardens have deflowred, Hot Summers hath thy fruits consumption bin; Fire, many places of thee hath devoured, And all fore-warnings to repent thy sinne. Yet still thou didst defer't, and carelesse sleep, Which heav? perceiving with black clouds did frown And into flouds for very anger weep, Yea, the salt Sea, a part of thee did drown. She drown'd a part, but oh, that part was small, Now teares more salt have overwhelm'd us all. Eleg. 42. [Say, why was Henries Herse so glorious?] Say, why was Henries Herse so glorious? And his sad Funerall so full of state? Why went he to his Tombe as one victorious, Seeming as blithe as when he liv'd of late? What needed all that Ceremonious show? And that dead living Image which they bare? Could not Remembrance make us smart enough, Vnlesse we did afresh renew it there? What was it but some antique curious Rite, Onely to feed the vain beholders eyes, To make men in their sorrows more delight, Or may we rather on it morallize? Yes, yes, it shew'd, that though he wanted breath, Yet he should ride in triumph over death. Eleg. 43. [How welcome now would our deare Henry be] How welcome now would our deare Henry be After these griefes; were he no more than straid, And thus deem'd dead? but fie! what Fantasie Feeds my vain thought on? Fate hath that denay'd. But since hee's gone, we now can call to minde, His latest words, and whereto they did tend: Yea, now our blunt capacities can finde, They plainly did prognosticate his end. Beside, we finde our Prophesies of old, And would perswade our selves 'twas known of yore By skilfull Wizards, and by them fore-told, But then why found we not so much before? Oh mark this ever, we n'er know our state, Nor see our losse before it be too late. Eleg. 44. [From passion thus to passion could I run] From passion thus to passion could I run, Till I had over-run a world of words, My Muse might she be heard would n'er have done, The subject matter infinite affords, But there's a mean in all; with too much grieving We must not of Gods providence despaire, Like cursed Pagans, or men unbeleeving. 'Tis true, the Hopes that we have lost were faire: But we beheld him with an outward eye, And though he in our sight most worthy seem'd, Yet God saw more, whose secrets none can spie, And finds another whom we lesse esteem'd: So Iesses eldest sonnes had most renown, But little David did obtain the Crown. Eleg. 45. [Let us our trust alone in God repose] Let us our trust alone in God repose, Since Princes fail; and maugre Turk or Pope, He will provide one that shall quail our foes. We saw he did it when we had lesse hope: Let's place our joyes in him, and weep for sinne, Yea, let's in time amend it, and foresee, (If losse of earthly hope hath grievous been) How great the losse of heavens true joyes may be: This if we doe? God will stretch forth his hand, To stop those plagues he did intend to bring, And powre such blessings on this mournfull Land, We shall for IO, Hallelujah sing: And our deare Iames, if we herein persever, Shall have a Sonne to grace his Throne for ever. An Epitaph, Vpon the most Hopefull and All-vertuous Henry Prince of Wales. Stay Traveller and read, didst never heare, In all thy journeys any news or tales Of him whom our divided world esteem'd so deare, And named Henry, the brave Prince of Wales. Look here, within this little place he lies, Ev'n he that was the Vniversall Hope: And almost made this Ile Idolatrize, See, hee's contented with a little scope. And as the Canutus. Dane that on Southamptons strand His Courtiers idle flatteries did chide, (Who term'd him both the God of sea and land,) By shewing he could not command the Tide; So this, to mock vain Hopes in him began, Di'd and here lies, to shew he was a man. A supposed Inter-locution between the Spirit of Prince Henry, and Great Britain. Britain. Awake brave Prince, thou dost thy Countrey wrong, Shake off thy slumber thou hast slept too long, Open thy eye-lids, and raise up thy head, Thy Country and thy Friends suppose thee dead. Look up, look up, the daies are grown more short Thy Officers prepare to leave thy Court. The stains of sorrow are in every face, And Charles is call'd upon to take thy Place. Awake, I say, in time; and wake the rather, Lest melancholy hurt thy Royall Father. Thy weeping Mother wailes and wrings her hands, Thy Brother and thy Sister mourning stands, The want of that sweet company of thine Inly torments the loving Prince of Rhine. The Beauties of the Court are sullied o'er, They seem not cheerfull as they did before. The heavy Clergie in their Pulpits mourn, And thy Attendants look like men forlorn. Once more (I say) sweet Prince, once more arise, See how the teares have drown'd my watry eyes; All my sweet tunes and former signes of gladnesse, Are turn'd to Elegies and Songs of sadnesse. The Trumpet with harsh notes the aire doth wound And Dump is all the cheerfull Drum can sound. Through Wales a dolefull Elegie now rings: And heavy Songs of sorrow each man sings: Distressed Ireland too, as sad as wee, Cries loud, Oh hone, oh hone, for want of thee. But more, Romes Locusts do begin to swarm, And their attempts with stronger Hopes they arm, For taking hold of this thy Trans-mutation, They plot again a damned Toleration. Yea Hell, to double this our sorrows weight, Is new contriving of old Eighty eight. Come then and stand against it to defend us, Or else their guile, their plots, or force will end us. This last-last time, sweet Prince, I bid thee rise, Great Britons droup already, each man flies, And if thou save us not from our great foes, They quickly will effect our overthrows. Oh, yet he moves not up his living head, And now I fear indeed he's dead. Spir. He's dead. Brit. What voice was that, which from the vaulted roofe Of my last words did make so plain a proofe? What was it seem'd to speak above me so, And saies, He's dead? Was't Eccho, yea, or no? Sp. No. Br. What? Is it some dispos'd to flout my mone? Appeare; Hast thou a body, or hast none? Sp. None. Br. Sure some illusion, oh what art? come hither, My Princes Ghost, or fiend, or neither? Sp. Neither. Br. Indeed his Ghost in heaven rests I know, Art thou some Angel for him, Is it so? Sp. So. Br. Do not my reall griefs with visions feed, In earnest speak, Art so indeed? Sp. Indeed. Brit. What power sent thee now into my Coast? Was it my Darling Henries Ghost? Sp. s' Ghost. Br. Th' art welcome then, thy presence gratefull is, But tell me, Lives he happily in blisse? Sp. y's. Br. If so much of thee may be understood, Is the intent of this thy comming good? Sp God. Br. Say, hath he there the fame that here he had? Or doth the place unto his glory adde? Sp. Adde. Br. May I demand what thy good errands be, To whom is that he told to thee? Sp. To thee. Br. Oh, doth he minde me yet, sweet Spirit say, What is thy message? Ile obey: Sp. Obey. Br. I will not to my power one tittle misse, Do but command and say, Doe this: Sp. Doe this. Br. But stay; it seems that thou hast made thy choyse To speak with Eccho's most imperfect voyce: In plainer wise declare why thou art sent, That I may heare with more content: Sp. Content. The Spirit leaves his Eccho, and speaks on. Sp. Then heare me Britain, heare me, and beleeve Thy Henri's there now where he cannot grieve. He is not subject to the sly invasion Of any humane or corrupted Passion. For then (although he sorrow now forbeares) He would have wept himselfe to see thy tears. But he (as good Saints are) of joyes partaker, Is jealous of the glory of his Maker: And though the Saints of Rome may take it to them, (Much help to their damnation it will doe them) He will not on his Masters right presume, Nor his small'st due unto himselfe assume. And therefore Britain in the name of God, And on the pain of his revengefull rod, He here conjures thee in thy tribulation To make to God alone thy invocation; Who took him from thee that but late was living, For too much trust unto his weaknesse giving. Yet call'st thou on thy Prince still, as if he Could either Saviour or Redeemer be: Thou tell'st him of the wicked Whore of Rome, As if that he were Iudge to give her doome. But thou might'st see, were not thy sight so dim, Thou mak'st mean while another Whore of him. For what is't for a Creatures aide to crie But Spirits whordome? (that's idolatry.) Their most unpleasing breaths that so invoke, The passage of th' Almighties mercies choke: And therefore if thy sorrows shall have end, To God thou must thy whole devotions bend. Then will thy King that he leave off to mone, God hath tane His, yet left him more than one. And that he hath not so severely done, As when he crav'd the Hebrewes onely sonne; Because beside this little blessed store, There's yet a possibility of more. Goe tell the Queen his Mother that's lamenting, There is no cause of that her discontenting. And say, there is another in his place, Shall do his loving Sisters Nuptialls grace. Enforme the Palatine his Nymph of Thame, Shall give his glorious Rhine a treble Fame: And unto Charles, to whom he leaves his place, Let this related be in any case; Tell him he may a full possession take Of what his Brother did so late forsake; But bid him look what to his place is due, And every vice ingenerall eschew: Let him consider why he was his Brother, And plac'd above so many thousand other. Great honours have great burthens; if y'are high, The stricters your account, and the more nigh: Let him shun flatterers at any hand, And ever firmly in Religion stand, Gird on his Sword; call for th' Almighties might, Keep a good conscience, fight the Lambs great fight. For when his Father shall surrender make, The Faith's protection he must undertake. Then Charles take heed, for thou shalt heare a-far, Some cry, Peace, peace, that have their hearts on war. Let Policie Religion obey, But let not Policie Religion sway: Shut from thy Counsells such as have profest The worship of that Antichristian beast. For howsoe'er they dawb't with colours trim, Their hands do beare his mark, their hearts on him; And though they seem to seek the Commons weale, 'Tis but the Monsters deadly wound to heale. Banish all Romish Statists, do not sup Of that dy'd-painted Drabs infectious Cup, Yea, use thy utmost strength, and all thy power To scatter them that would buil'd Babels tower. Thou must sometime be Iudge of equity, And oft survey e'en thine own Family: That at thy Table none part ker bee, That will not at Christ's board partake with thee. The Lords great Day is neare, 'tis neare at hand, Vnto thy combate see thou bravely stand. For him that overcomes Christ keeps a Crown, And the great'st conquest hath the great'st renown. Be mercifull, and yet in mercy just: Chase from thy Court both wantonnesse and lust. Disguised fashions from the land casheere, Women may women, and men, men appeare. The wide-wide mouth of the blasphemer tears His passage unto God through all the Sphears, Provoking him to turn his peacefull Word Into a bloudy double-edged sword: But cut his tongue, the clapper of damnation, He may fright others with his Vlulation. The Drunkard and Adulterer, from whence Proceeds the cause of dearth and pestilence, Punish with losse of substance and of limbe, He rather maimed unto heaven may climbe, Than tumble whole to Hell, and by his sin Endanger the whole state he liveth in. Down, down with Pride, and overthrow Ambition; Grace true devotion, root out superstition; Love them that love the Truth, and Vertue graces, Let honesty, not wealth, obtain great places; Begin but such a course, and so persever, Thou shalt have love here, and true blisse for ever. Thus much for thy new Prince: now this to thee, Britain, it shall thy charge and duty be, To tell him now what thou hast heard me say, And whensoever he commands, obey: So if thou wilt in minde this counsell beare; Vnto thy state have due regard and care; And without stay unto amendment hie, Thou shalt be deare to those to whom I flie. Br. Oh, stay, and do not leave me yet alone. Sp. My errand's at an end I must be gone. Brit. Go then; but let me aske one word before. Spir. My speech now fails, I may discourse no more. Brit. Yet let me crave thus much, if so I may, By Eccho thou reply to what I say. Sp. Say. Br. First, tell me for his sake thou count'st most deare, Is Babel's fall, and Iacob's rising neare? Sp. Neare. Br. Canst thou declare what day that work shall end, Or rather must we yet attend? Sp. Attend. Br. Some land must yeeld a Prince that blow to strike May I be that same land or no, is't like? Sp. Like. Br. Then therfore 'tis that Rome bears us such spight. Is she not plotting now to wrong our right? Sp. right. Brit. But from her mischiefe, and her hands impure, Canst thou our safe deliverance assure? Sp Sure. Brit. Then notwithstanding this late losse befell, And we fear'd much, I trust 'tis well? Sp. 'Tis well. Brit. Then flie thou to thy place, if this be true, Thou God be prais'd, and griefes adieu. Sp. Adieu. A Sonnet of Death, Composed in Latine Rimes, and Paraphrastically translated into the same kinde of verse; both by the former Author. Latin verse has been omitted from this poem. Hark, hark, Death knocks us up with importunity, There's none shall ever make boast of impunitie. The Doctor toyles in vain, mans life's not durable, No med'cine can prevail, this wound's incurable. What will the countenance of Lords or Noblemen, Or idle peoples love help or avail thee then? Nor the worlds bravery, nor yet Court-vanity, Can stay this Monsters hand, foe to humanity. He knows no reverence, nor cares for any state, Sweet beauties move him not, thogh ne'er so delicate, Princes must stoop to him, he rides on martially, And spares not any man, but strikes impartially. The rich-mans money-bags are no perswasion, The beggers wofull cry stirs up no passion, Hee'l not beguiled be by any fallacy, Nor yeeld to Rhetorick, wit, art, nor policy. His look's both pale and wan, yet doth it terrifie, He masters any man, (alas, what remedy!) Hee's nothing curious which way the measures be, But all dance after him that heare his melody. But wo! of all the rest this seems most terrible, He comes when we know least, and then invisible, Then quite there endeth all worldly prosperity, Such is this lives estate, such his severity. Then oh you wretched men! sith this is evident, See you more carefull be, oh be more provident! And when he takes this life, full of incertainty; You shall live evermore to all eternity. FINIS. A SATYRE, Written To the Kings most Excellent Majestie, BY George Wither, When he was Prisoner in the Marshalsey, for his first Book. The Satyre to the meer Courtiers. Sirs, I do know your minds, you look for fees; For more respect than needs, for caps and knees: But be content, I haue not for you now, Nor will I have at all to do with you. For though I seem opprest, and you suppose I must be fain to crouch to Vertues foes; Yet know, your favours I do sleight them more In this distresse, than e'er I did before. Here to my Liege a message I must tell, If you will let me passe you shall do well; If you deny admittance, why then know I mean to have it where you will or no. Your formall wisdome which hath never been In ought but in some fond invention seen: And you that think men born to no intent But to be train'd in apish complement; Doth now perhaps suppose me indiscreet, And such unused messages unmeet. But what of that? Shall I go suit my matter Vnto your wits, that have but wit to flatter? Shall I of your opinions so much prize, To lose my will, that you may think me wise, Who never yet to any liking had, Vnlesse he were a Knave, a Fool, or mad? You Mushroms know, so much I weigh your powers, I neither value you, nor what is yours. Nay, though my crosses had me quite out-worn. Spirit enough I'de finde, your spite to scorn Of which resolv'd, to further my adventure, Vnto my King, without your leaves I enter. To the Honest Courtiers. Bvt You, whose onely worth doth colour give To Them that they do worthy seem to live, Kinde Gentlemen, your aide I crave to bring A Satyre to the presence of his King, A show of rudenesse doth my forehead arm, Yet you may rust him, he intends no harm. He that hath sent him, loyall is, and true, And one whose love (I know) is much to you: But now he lies bound to a narrow scope; Almost beyond the Cape of all good Hope. Long hath he sought to free himselfe, but fails: And therefore seeing nothing else prevails, Me to acquaint his Soveraigne here he sends, As one desparing of all other friends. I do presume that you will favour show him, Now that a messenger from thence you know him, For many thousands that his face ne'er knew, Blame his Accusers, and his fortunes rue: And by the help which your good word may doe, He hopes for pitty from his Soveraigne too. Then in his presence with your favours grace him, And there's no Vice so great shall dare out-face him. To the Kings most Excellent Majestie. A Satyre. Quid tu, si pereo? What once the Poet said, I may avow, 'Tis a hard thing not to write Satyrs now. Since what we speak (abuse reigns so in all) Spight of our hearts will be Satyricall. Let it not therefore now be deemed strange, My unsmooth'd lines their rudenesse do not change, Nor be distastfull to my gracious King, That in the Cage my old harsh notes I sing: And rudely make a Satyre here unfold, What others would in neater tearms have told. And why? my friends and means in Court are scant, Knowledge of curious phrase and form I want. I cannot bear't to run my selfe in debt, To hire the Groom, to bid the Page intreat Some favour'd Follower to vouchsafe his word, To get me a cold comfort from his Lord. I cannot sooth, (though it my life might save) Each Favourite, nor crouch to ev'ry Knave. I cannot brook delaies, as some men doe, With scoffes and scornes, and tak't in kindnesse too. For e'er I'de binde my selfe for some sleight grace To one that hath no more worth than his place: Or, by a base meane free my selfe from trouble, I rather would endure my penance double. Cause to be forc'd to what my minde disdains, Is worse to me than tortures, racks, and chaines. And therefore unto Thee I onely flye, To whom there needs no mean but honesty. To Thee that lov'st nor Parasite or Minion, Should e'er I speak possesse thee with opinion. To Thee that dost what thou wilt undertake, For love of Iustice, not the persons sake. To Thee that knowst how vain all fair shews be, That flow not from the hearts sincerity; And canst, though shadowed in the simplest vail, Discern both Love and Truth, and where they fail. To Thee I do appeal, in whom heaven knows, I next to God my confidence repose. For, can it be thy Grace should ever shine, And not enlighten such a cause as mine? Can my hopes (fixt in thee great King) be dead; Or thou those Satyres hate thy Forrests bred? Where shall my second hopes be founded then, If ever I have heart to hope agen? Can I suppose a favour may be got In any place, when thy Court yeelds it not? Or that I may obtain it in the land, When I shall be deni'd it at thy hand? And if I might, could I delighted be To tak't of others, when I mist of thee? Or if I were, could I have comfort by it, When I should think my Soveraigne did deny it? No, were I sure I to thy hate were born, To seek for others favours I would scorn. For if the best-worth-loves I could not gain, To labour for the rest I would disdain. But why should I thy favour here distrust, That have a cause so known, and known so just? Which not alone my inward comfort doubles, But all suppose me wrong'd that heare my troubles. Nay, though my fault were reall, I beleeve, Thou art so Royall that thou wouldst forgive. For, well I know thy sacred Majesty Hath ever been admir'd for Clemencie, And at thy gentlenesse the world hath wondred, For making Sun-shine where thou mightst have thundred. Yea, thou in mercy life to them didst give That could not be content to see thee live. And can I think that thou wilt make me then, The most unhappy of all other men? Or let thy loyall subject against reason, Be punish'd more for Love than some for Treason? No thou didst never yet thy glory stain With an injustice to the meanest Swain. 'Tis not thy will I'm wrong'd, nor dost thou know If I have suffred injuries or no. For if I have not heard false rumours flie, Th' ast grac'd me with the stile of honesty. And if it were so, (as some think it was) I cannot see how it should come to passe, That thou, from whose free tongue proceedeth nought Which is not correspondent with thy thought. Those thoughts too, being fram'd in Reasons mould, Should speak that once which should not ever hold. But passing it as an uncertainty, I humbly beg thee by that Majesty, Whose sacred Glory strikes a loving-feare Into the hearts of all to whom 'tis deare: To deigne me so much favour, without merit, As read this plant of a distempered spirit: And think, unlesse I saw some hideous storme, Too great to be endur'd by such a worme, I had not thus presum'd unto a King, With Ãsops Fly to seek an Eagles wing. Know, I am he that entred once the list Gainst all the world to play the Satyrist: 'Twas I that made my measures rough and rude, Danc'd, arm'd with whips, amidst the multitude, And unappaled with my charmed Scrowls, Teaz'd angry Monsters in their lurking holes. I've plaid with Wasps and Hornets without fears, Till mad they grew and swarm'd about my eares. I've done it; and me thinks 'tis such brave sport, I may be stung, but n'er be sorry for't. For all my griefe is, that I was so sparing, And had to more in't worth the name of daring. He that will tax these times must be more bitter, Tart lines of Vinegar and Gall are fitter. My fingers and my spirits were benum'd, My Ink ran forth too smooth, 'twas too much gum'd; I'd have my Pen so paint it where it traces, Each accent should draw bloud into their faces; And make them when their Villanies are blazed, Shudder and startle as men halfe amazed, For feare my verse should make so loud a din, Heaven hearing might rain vengeance on their sin, Oh, now for such a Strain! would Art could teach it. Though halfe my spirits I consum'd to reach it I'd learn my Muse so brave a course to flie, Men should admire the power of Poesie. And those that dar'd her greatnesse to resist, Quake even at naming of a Satyrist. But wh? his scourging numbers flow'd with wonder, Should cry, God blesse us, as they did at thunder. Alas! my lines came from me too-too dully, They did not fill a Satyrs mouth up fully. Hot bloud and youth, enrag'd with passions store, Taught me to reach a strain, ne'er touch'd before. But it was coldly done, I throughly chid not, And somewhat there is yet to do, I did not. More soundly could my Scourge have yerked many, Which I omitted not for feare of any. For, want of action, discontentments, rage, Base dis-respect of Vertue (in this age) With other things which were to goodnesse wrong, Made me so fearlesse in my carelesse Song: That had not reason within compasse won me, I had told truth enough to have undone me (Nay, have already, if that her divine And unseen power can do no more than mine.) For though foreseeing warinesse was good, I fram'd my stile unto a milder mood; And clogging her high-towring wings with mire, Made her halfe earth; that was before all fire. Though as you saw, in a disguised shew, I brought my Satyres to the open view: Hoping (their out-sides, being mis-esteem'd) They might have passed but for what they seem'd: Yet some, whose Comments jump not with my minde, In that low phrase a higher reach would finde, And out of their deep judgements seem to know What 'tis uncertain if I meant or no; Ayming thereby out of some private hate, To work my shame, or over-throw my state. For amongst many wrongs my foe doth do me, And many imputations laid unto me, (Deceived in his aym) he doth mis-conster, That which I have enstil'd a Man-like-Monster, To mean some private person in the state, Whose worth I sought to wrong out of my hate; Vpbraiding me, I from my word do start, Either for want of better ground, or heart. Cause from his expectation I did vary, In the denying of his Commentary; Whereas 'tis known I meant Abuse the while, Not thinking any one to be so vile To merit all those Epithites of shame, How ever any do deserve much blame. But say, (I grant) that I had an intent To have it so (as he interprets) meant; And let my gracious Liege suppose there were One whom the State may have just cause to feare; Or think there were a man, and great in Court, That had more faults than I could well report, Suppose I knew him, and had gone about By some particular marks to paint him out, That he best knowing his own faults might see He was the man (I would) should noted be: Imagine now such doings in this age, And that this man so pointed at should rage; Call me in question, and by his much threatning, By long imprisonment, and ill-intreating Vrge a Confession, wert not a mad part For me to tell him what lay in my heart? Do not I know a Great mans power and might In spight of innocence can smother right, Coulour his Villanies to get esteem? And make the honest man, the villain seem? And that the truth I told should in conclusion, For want of power and friends be my confusion! I know it, and the world doth know 'tis true; Yet I protest, if such a man I knew, That might my Countrey prejudice, or Thee, Were he the greatest or the proudest Hee That breathes this day: (if so it might be found, That any good to either might redound.) So far Ile be (though Fate against me run) From starting off from that I have begun, I un-appaled dare in such a case, Rip up his foulest crimes before his face; Though for my labour I were sure to drop Into the mouth of ruine without hope. But such strange far-fetch'd meanings they have sought; As I was never privie to in thought, And that unto particulars would tie Which I intended universally. Whereat Some, with displeasure over-gone, (Those I scarce dream'd of, saw, or thought upon) Maugre those caveats on my Satyres brow, Their honest and just passage disallow. And on their heads so many censures take, That spight of me themselves they'l guilty make. Nor is't enough to swage their discontent, To say I am, (or to be) innocent. For as when once the Lyon made decree, No horned-beast should nigh his presence be, That on whose forehead onely did appeare A bunch of flesh, or but some tuft of haire, Was even as far in danger as the rest, If he but said, it was a horned beast. So there be now, who think in that their power Is of much force, and greater far than our, It is enough to prove a guilt in me, Because (mistaking) they so think't to be. Yet 'tis my comfort, they are not so high, But they must stoop to Thee and Equity. And this I know though prick't; they storm agen The world doth deem them ne'er the better men. To stir in filth makes not the stench the lesse, Nor doth Truth feare the frown of Mightinesse. Because those numbers she doth daigne to grace, Men may suppresse a while, but ne'er deface. I wonder, and 'tis wondred at by many, My harmlesse lines should breed distast in any: And so, that (whereas most good men approve My labour to be worthy thanks and love) I as a Villain and my Countryes foe Should be imprison'd, and so strictly too, That not alone my liberty is barr'd, But the resort of friends (which is more hard) And whilst each wanton, or loose Rimers Pen, With oyly words sleeks o'er the sinnes of men, Vayling his wits to every Puppets beck; Which e'er I'le do, I'le joy to break my neck. (I say) while such as they in every place Can finde protection, patronage, and grace; If any look on me, 'tis but a skaunce, Or if I get a favour 'tis by chance. I must protect my selfe: poore truth and I Can have scarce one speak for our honesty. Then whereas they can gold and gifts attain, Malicious hate and envy is my gain, And not alone have here my Freedome lost, Whereby my best hope's likely to be crost: But have been put to more charge in one day, Than all my Patrons bounties yet will pay. What I have done was not for thirst of gain, Or out of hope preferments to attain: Since to condemne them would more profit me, Then all the glories in the world that be: Yet they are helps to Vertue us'd aright, And when they wanting be, she wants her might. For Eagles mindes ne'er fit a Ravens feather. To dare and to be able suit together. But what is't I have done so worty blame, That some so eagerly pursue my fame? Vouchsafe to view't with thine own eyes, and trie (Save want of Art) what fault thou canst espie. I have not sought to scandalize the state, Nor sown sedition, nor made publike bate: I have not aim'd at any good mans fame, Nor tax'd directly any one by name. I am not be that am grown discontent With the Religion, or the Government. I meant no Ceremonies to protect, Nor do I favour any new-sprung Sect; But to my Satyres gave this onely warrant, To apprehend and punish Vice apparant. Who aiming in particular at none, In generall upbraided every one, That each (unshamed of himselfe) might view That in himselfe, which no man dares to shew. And hath this Age bred up neat Vice so tenderly, She cannot brook it to be touch'd so slenderly? Will she not bide my gentle Satyres bites? Harme take her then, what makes she in their sightes? If with impatience she my whip-cord feel, How had she raged at my lash of Steel? But, am I cal'd in question for her cause? Is't Vice that these afflictions on me draws? And need I now thus to Apologize, Onely because I scourged villanies? Must I be fain to give a reason why, And how I dare allow of honesty? Whilst that each fleering Parasite is bold, Thy Royall brow undaunted to behold: And every Temporizer strikes a string, That's Musick for the hearing of a King? Shall not he reach out to obtain as much, Who dares more for thee than a hundred such? Heaven grant her patience, my Muse takes't so badly, I feare shee'l lose her wits, for she raves madly. Yet let not my dread Soveraigne too much blame her, Whose awfull presence now hath made her tamer. For if there be no Flie but hath her spleen, Nor a poore Pismire but will wreak her teen; How shall I then that have both spleen and gall, Being unjustly dealt with, beare with all? I yet with patience take what I have born, And all the worlds ensuing hate can scorn: But 'twere in me as much stupiditie Not to have feeling of an injury, As it were weaknesse not to brook it well; What others therefore think I cannot tell; But, he that'e lesse than mad is more than Man, Who sees when he hath done the best he can To keep within the bounds of Innocence, Sought to discharge his due to God and Prince; That he, whilst Villains unreproved go, Scoffing to see him overtaken so, Should have his good endeavours misconceiv'd, Be of his dearest liberty bereav'd, And which is worse, without a reason why, Be frownd on by Authorities grim eye. By that great Power my soule so much doth feare, Shee scornes the sternest frowns of a mortall Peer, But that I Vertue love for her own sake; It were enough to make me undertake To speak as much in praise of Vice agen, And practise some to plague these shames of men. I mean those my Accusers, who mistaking My ayms, do frame conceits of their own making. But if I list, I need not buy so deare, The just revenge might be inflicted here. Now could I measures frame in this just fury, Should sooner finde some guilty than a Iury: The words like swords (tempred with Art) should pierce, And hang, and draw, and quarter them in Verse: Or I could rack them on the wings of Fame, (And hee's halfe hang'd (they say) hath an ill name) Yea, I'd go neare to make those guilty elves Lycambes-like be glad to hang themselves: And though this Age will not abide to heare The faults reprov'd that Custome hath made deare; Yet if I pleased, I could write their crimes, And pile them up in walls for after-times: For they'l be glad (perhaps) that shall ensue, To see some story of their Fathers true. Or should I smother'd be in darknesse still, I might not use the freedome of a quill; 'Twould raise up braver Spirits than mine own, To make my cause, and this their guilt more known: Who by that subject should get love and fame, Vnto my Foes disgrace and endlesse shame: Those I do mean whose Comments have misus'd me, And to those Peers I honour have accus'd me: Making against my innocence their batteries, And wronging them by their base flatteries: But of revenge I am not yet so fain, To put my selfe unto that needlesse pain: Because I know a greater Power there is, That noteth smaller injuries than this; And being still as just as it is strong, Apportions due revenge for every wrong. But why (some say) should his too saucy Rimes Thus tax the wise and great ones of our times? It suits not with his yeares to be so bould, Nor fits it us by him to be controld. I must confesse ('tis very true indeed) Such should not of my censure stand in need. But blame me not, I saw good Vertue poore, Desert among the most thrust out of doore, Honesty hated, Courtesie banished, Rich-men excessive, Poore-men famished: Coldnesse in Zeale, in Lawes partiallity, Friendship but Complement, and vain Formalitie. Art I perceive contemn'd, while most advance (To offices of worth) Rich Ignorance: And those that should our Lights and Teachers be Live (if not worse) as wantonly as we. Yea, I saw Nature from her course run back, Disorders grow, good orders go to wrack. So to increase what all the rest began, I to this current of confusion ran: And seeing Age left of the place of guiding, Thus plaid the saucy wag, and fell to chiding. Wherein, however some (perhaps) may deem, I am not so much faulty as I seem: For when the Elders wrong'd Susanna's honour, And none withstood the shame they laid upon her; A Childe rose up to stand in her defence, And spight of wrong confirm'd her Innocence. To shew, Those must not that good undertake Strain curt'sie who should do't for manners sake. Nor do I know whether to me God gave A boldnesse more than many others have, That I might shew the world what shamefull blot Vertue by her lascivious Elders got. Nor is't a wonder, as some do suppose, My youth so much corruption can disclose; Since every day the Sun doth light mine eyes, I am informed of new villanies: But it is rather to be wondred how I either can, or, dare be honest now. And though again there be some others rage, That I should dare (so much above mine age) Thus censure each degree both young and old, I see not wherein I am over-bold. For if I have been plain with Vice, I care not, There's nought that I know good &amp; can, &amp; dare not. Onely this one thing doth my minde deterre, Even a feare (through ignorance) to erre. But oh! knew I what thou wouldst well approve, Or might the small'st respect within thee move; So in the sight of God it might be good, And with the quiet of my conscience stood: As well I know thy true integrity Would command nothing against piety:) There's nought so dangerous, or full of feare, That for my Soveraignes sake I would not dare: Which good beliefe, would it did not possesse thee, Provided some just triall might re-blesse me. Yea though a while I did endure the gall Of thy displeasure in this lothsome thrall. For notwithstanding in this place I lie By the command of that Authority, Of which I have so much respective care, That in mine own (and just defence) I feare To use the free speech that I do intend, Lest ignorance or rashnesse should offend. Yet is my meaning and my thought as free From wilfull wronging of thy laws or thee, As he to whom thy Place and Person's dearest, Or to himselfe that findes his conscience clearest. If there be wrong, 'tis not my making it, All the offence is somes mistaking it. And is there any Iustice borne of late, Makes those faults mine which others perpetrate? What man could ever any Age yet finde, That spent his spirits in this thanklesse kinde, Shewing his meaning, to such words could tie it, that none could either wrong, or mis-apply it? Nay, your own Laws which (as you do intend) In plainst and most effectuall words are penn'd, Cannot be fram'd so well to your intent, But some there be will erre from what you meant. And yet (alas) I must be tide unto What never any man before could do. Must all I speake or write so well be done, That none may pick more meanings thence than one? Then all the world I hope will leave dis-union, And every man become of one opinion, But since some may, what care soe'er we take, Divers constructions of our writings make, The honest Readers ever will conceive The best intentions, and all others leave, Chiefly in that where I forehand protest, My meaning ever was the honestest: And if I say so, what is he may know So much as to affirme it was not so? Sit other men so near my thoughts to show it, Or is my heart so open that all know it? Sure if it were they would no such things see, As those whereof some have accused me. But I care lesse how it be understood, Because the heav'ns know, my intent was good. And if it be so that my too-free Rimes Do much displease the world, and these bad times; 'Tis not my fault; for had I been imploy'd In something else, all this had now been void. Or if the world would but have granted me Wealth, or affaires whereon to busie me, I now unheard of, peradventure then Had been as mute as some rich Clergie-man. But they are much deceiv'd that think my minde Will e'er be still, while it can doing finde; Or that unto the world so much it leans, As to be curtall'd for default of means. No, though most be, all Spirits are not earth, Nor suiting with the fortunes of their birth. My bodie's subject unto many powers, But my soul's as free as is the Emperours: And though to curb her in I oft assay, Shee'll break in't action spite of durt and clay. And is't not better than to take this course, Than fall to studie mischiefe, and do worse? I say she must have action, and she shall, For if she will, how can I do withall? And let those that o'er busie think me, know, He made me that knew why he made me so. And though there's some do say, my thoughts do flie A pitch beyond my states sufficiency; My humble minde, I give my Saviour thank, Aspires nought yet 'bove my fortunes rank. But say it did, wilt not befit a man To raise his thoughts as near heaven as he can? Must the free-spirit ty'd and curbed be According to the bodies povertie? Or can it ever be so subject to Base Change, to rise and fall as fortunes do? Men born to noble means, and vulgar mindes, Enjoy their wealth; and there's no law that bindes Such to abate their substance, though their pates Want brains, and they worth to possesse their states. So God to some doth onely great mindes give; And little other means whereon to live. What law or conscience then shall make th? smother Their spirit, which is their life, more than other To bate their substance? since if 'twere confest, That a brave minde could ever be supprest, Wer't reason any should himselfe deprive Of what the whole world hath not pow'r to give? For wealth is common, and fools get it too, When to give spirit's more than Kings can do. I speak not this because I think there be More than the ordinarest gifts in me; But against those who think I do presume On more than doth befit me to assume; Or would have all whom Fortune bars from store, Make themselves wretched as she makes them poore And cause in other things she is unkinde, Smother the matchlesse blessings of their minde: Whereas (although her favours do forsake them) Their mindes are richer than the world can maketh Why should a good attempt disgraced seem Because the person is of mean esteem? Vertu's a chast Queen, and yet doth not scorn To be embrac'd by him that's meanest born; Shee is the prop that Majesties support, Yet one whom Slaves as well as Kings may court, She loveth all that beare affection to her, And yeelds to any that hath heart to wo her. So Vice, how high so e'er she be in place, Is that which Grooms may spit at in disgrace: Shee is a strumpet and may be abhor'd, Yea, spurn'd at in the bosome of a Lord. Yet had I spoke her fair I had been free, As many other of her Lovers be. If her escapes I had not chanc'd to tell, I might have been a Villain, and done well: Gotten some speciall favour, and not sate As now I do shut up within a grate. Or if I could have hap't on some loose strain, That might have pleas'd the wanton Readers vain: Or but claw'd Pride, I now had been unblam'd, (Or else at least there's some would not have sham'd To plead my cause) but see my fatall curse, Sure I was either mad, or somewhat worse. For I saw vices followers bravely kept, In Silks they walk'd, on beds of Down they slept, Richly they fed on dainties evermore, They had their pleasure, they had all things store: (Whilst Vertue begg'd, yea, favours had so many, I knew they brook'd not to be touch'd of any: Yet could not I like other men be wise, And learn for all this how to temporize; But must (with two much honesty made blinde, Vpbraid this loved Darling of mankinde: Whereas I might have better thriv'd by faining: Or if I could not chuse but be complaining, More safe I might have raill'd on Vertue sure, Because her lovers and her friends are fewer. I might have brought some other things to passe, Made Fidlers-Songs or Ballads, like an Asse, Or any thing almost indeed but this. Yet since 'tis thus, I'm glad 'tis so amisse; Because, if I am guilty of a crime, 'Tis that wherein the best of every time Hath been found faulty, (if they faulty be) That do reprove Abuse and Villany. For what I'm taxt, I can examples shew, In such old Authors as this State allow: And I would fain once learn a reason why They can have better usage here than I? I muse men do not now in question call Seneca, Horace, Persius, Iuvenal, And such as they? Or why did not that age In which they lived put them in a Cage? If I should say that men were juster then, I should neare hand be mad unsay't agen: And therefore sure I think I were as good, Leave it to others to be understood. Yet I as well may speak as deem amisse; For such this Ages curious cunning is, I scarcely dare to let my heart think ought, For there be some will seem to know my thought; Who may out-face me that I think a-wry, When there's no witnesse but my Conscience by: And then I likely am as well to speed, As if I spak, or did amisse indeed. Yet lest those, who (perhaps) may malice this, Interpret also these few lines amisse; Let them that after Thee shall read or heare, From a rash censure of my thoughts forbeare,: Let them not mold the sense that this contains According to the forming of their brains; Or think I dare or can here tax those Peers, Whose worths their Honours to my soule endears; (Those by whose loved-fear'd authority I am restrained of my liberty: For least there yet may be a man so ill, To haunt my lines with his black Coment still, (In hope my luck again may be so good To have my words once rightly understood) This I protest, that I do not condemne Ought as unjust that hath been done by them; For though my honest heart not guilty be Of the least thought that may disparage me; Yet when such men as I shall have such foes Accuse me of such crimes to such as those, Till I had means my Innocence to show, Their Iustice could have done no lesse than so. Nor have I such a proud conceited wit, Or selfe-opinion of my knowledge yet, To think it may not be that I have run Vpon some errours in what I have done, Worthy this punishment which I endure; (I say I cannot so my selfe assure) For 'tis no wonder if their wisedomes can Discover imperfections in a man So weak as I, (more than himselfe doth see) Since my sight dull with insufficiencie, In men more grave and wiser far than I, Innumerable errours doth espie; Which they with all their knowledge I'l be bould, Cannot (or will not) in themselves behold. But e'er I will my selfe accuse my Song, Or keep a tongue shall do my heart that wrong, To say I willingly in what I pen'd, Did ought that might a Goodmans sight offend; Or with my knowledge did insert one word That might disparage a true honour'd Lord; Let it be in my mouth a helplesse sore, And never speak to be beleeved more. Yet man irresolute is, unconstant, weak, And doth his purpose oft through frailty break. Lest therefore I by force hereafter may Be brought from this minde, and these words unsay, Here to the world I do proclaim before, If e'er my resolution be so poore, 'Tis not the Right, but might that makes me do it; Yea nought but fearefull basenesse brings me to it; Which if I still hate, as I now detest, Never can come to harbour in my brest. Thus my fault then, (if they a fault imply) Is not alone an ill unwillingly, But also might I know it, I entend, Not onely to acknowledge, but amend: Hoping that thou wilt not be so severe, To punish me above all other here. But for m'intents sake, and my love to Truth; Impute my errours to the heat of Youth, Or rather ignorance, then to my will, Which sure I am was good, what e'er be ill, And like to him now in whose place thou art, What e'er the residue be, accept the Heart. But I grow tedious, and my love abus'd, Disturbs my thoughts, and makes my lines confus'd. Yet pardon me, and daigne a gracious eye, On this my rude unfil'd Apologie. Let not the bluntnesse of my phrase offend, Weigh but the matter, and not how 'tis penn'd, By these abrupt lines in my just defence, Iudge what I might say for my innocence. And think I more could speak, that here I spare, Because my power suits not to what I dare. My unaffected stile retains (you see) Her old Frize-Cloak of young Rusticitie: If others will use neater tearmes, they may, Ruder I am, yet love as well as they: And (though if I would smooth't I cannot doo't) My humble heart I bend beneath thy foot; While here my Muse her discontent doth sing, To thee her great Apollo and my King: Emploring thee by that high sacred Name, By Iustice, by those Powers that I could name: By whatsoe'er may move entreat I thee, To be what thou art unto all, to me; I feare it not, yet give me leave to pray, I may have foes, whose power doth beare such sway, If they but say I'm guilty of offence, 'Twere vain for me to plead my innocence. But as the Name of God thou bear'st, I trust Thou immitat'st him too in beeing just: That when the right of truth thou com'st to scan, Thou'lt not respect the person of the man; For if thou do, then is my hope undone, The head-long-way to ruine I must run. For whil'st that they have all the helps which may Procure their pleasure with my soon decay: How is it like that I my peace can win me, When all the ayde I have comes from within me? Therefore (good King) that mak'st thy bounty shine Sometime on those whose worth's are small as mine; Oh! save me now from Envies dangerous shelfe, Or make me able, and I'l save my selfe. Let not the want of that make me a scorn, To which there are more Fools than Wisemen born. Let me not for my meannesse be despis'd, Nor others greatnesse make their words more priz'd, For what soe'er my outward Fate appears, My soul's as good, my heart's as great as theirs: My love unto my Countrey, and to Thee As much as his that more would seem to be. And would this age allow but means to show it, Those that misdoubt it, should e'er long time know it. Pitty my youth then, and let me not lie Wasting my time in fruitlesse misery. Though I am mean, I may be born unto That service which another cannot doe. In vain the little Mouse the Lyon spar'd not, Shee did him pleasure when a greater dar'd not. If ought that I have done do thee displease, Thy misconceived wrath I will appease, Or sacrifice my heart; but why should I Suffer for God knows whom, I know not why? If that my words through some mistake offends, Let them conceive them right and make amends. Or were I guilty of offence indeed, One fault (they say) doth but one pardon need. Yet one I had, and now I want one more; For once I stood accus'd for this before. As I remember, I so long agon Sung Thame and Rhynes Epithalamion; When Shee, that from thy Royall Self derives Those gracious vertues that best title gives: Shee that makes Rhyne proud of her Excellence, And me oft mind her here with reverence, Daign'd in her great-good Nature to incline Her gentle eare to such a Cause as mine; And which is more, vouchsaf'd her word to cleare Me from all dangers (if there any were) So that I do not now intreat, or sue For any great boon, or request that's new: But onely this, (though absent from the land) Her former favour still in force might stand; And that her word (who present was so deare) Might be as powerfull as when she was here. Which if I finde, and with thy favour may Have leave to shake my loathed bands away, (As I do hope I shall) and be set free From all the trouble this hath brought on me; I'l make her Name give life unto a Song, Whose never-dying note shall last as long As there is either River, Grove, or Spring, Or Down for Sheep, or Shepheards Lad to sing. Yea, I will teach my Muse to touch a strain, That was ne'er reach'd to yet by any Swain. For though that many deem my years unripe, Yet I have learn'd to tune an Oaten Pipe, Whereon I'l try what musick I can make me, (Vntill Bellona with her Trump awake me.) And since the world will not have Vice thus shown, By blazing Vertue I will make it known. Then if the Court will not my lines approve, I'l go unto some mountain, or thick grove: There to my fellow' Shepheards will I Sing, Tuning my Reed unto some dancing Spring; In such a note that none should dare to trouble it, Till the hills answer, and the woods redouble it. And peradventure I may then go neare To speak of something thou'lt be pleas'd to heare: And that which those who now my tunes abhor, Shall read, and like, and daigne to love me for. But the mean while, oh passe not this suit by, Let thy free hand signe me my liberty: And if my love may move thee more to doe, Good King consider this my trouble too. Others have found thy favour in distresse, Whose love to thee and thine I think was lesse. And I might fitter for thy service live, On what would not be much for thee to give. And yet I ask it not, for that I feare The outward means of life should fail me here: For though I want to compasse those good ends I aim at for my Countrey and my Friends, In this poore state I can as well content me, As if that I had wealth and honours lent me. Nor for my own sake do I seek to shun, This thraldome, wherein now I seem undone: For though I prize my freedome more than Gold, And use the means to free my selfe from hold, Yet with a minde (I hope) unchang'd and free, Here can I live and play with miserie, Yea, in despight of want and slavery, Laugh at the world in all her bravery. Here have I learn'd to make my greatest wrongs, Matter of mirth, and subjects but for Songs: Here can I smile to see my selfe neglected, And how the mean-mans suit is dis-respected; Whilst those that are more rich, and better friended, Can have twice greater faults, thrice sooner ended. All this, yea more, I see and suffer too, Yet live content midst discontents I doe. Which whilst I can it is all one to me, Whether in prison, or abroad it be. For should I still lie here distrest and poore, It shall not make me breathe a sigh the more. Since to my selfe it is indifferent, Where the small remnant of my daies be spent. But for Thy sake, my Countries, and my Friends, For whom, more than my selfe, God this life lends, I would not, could I help it, be a scorn, But (if I might) live free as I was born: Or rather for my Mistris vertues sake, Fair Vertue, of whom most account I make, If I can chuse, I will not be debas'd In this last action, lest She be disgrac'd: For 'twas the love of her that brought me to What spleen nor envy could not make me do. And if her servants be no more regarded, If enemies of Vice be thus rewarded; And I should also Vertues wrongs conceale, As if none liv'd to home she dar'd appeal: Will they that do not yet her worth approve, Be ever drawn to entertain her love,, When they shall see him plagu'd as an offender, Who for the love he beares her, doth commend her This may to others more offensive be, Than prejudiciall any way to me, For who will his endeavours ever bend To follow her whom there is none will friend? Some I do hope there be that nothing may From love of truth and honesty dismay. But who will (that shall see my evill Fortune) The remedy of times abuse importune? Who will again, when they have smother'd me, Dare to oppose the face of Villany? Whereas he must be fain to undertake A combate with a second Lernean Snake; Whose ever-growing heads when as he crops, Not onely two springs for each one he lops, But also he shall see in midst of dangers, Those he thought friends, turn foes, at least-wise strangers. More I could speak, but sure if this do fail me I never shall doe ought that will avail me; Nor care to speak again, unlesse it be To him that knows how heart and tongue agree; No nor to live, when none dares undertake To speak one word for honest Vertues sake. But let his will be done that best knows what Will be my future good, and what will not. Hap well, or ill, my spotlesse meaning's faire, And for Thee, this shall ever be my prayer, That thou maist here enjoy a long-blest Reigne, And dying be in heaven re-crown'd again. So now, if thou hast daign'd my lines to heare, There's nothing can befall me that I feare: For if thou hast compassion on my trouble, The joy I shall receive will be made double; And if I fall, it may some glory be, That none but Iove himselfe did ruine me. Your Majesties loyall Subject, and yet Prisoner in the Marshalsey George Wither. Finis. A Metricall Paraphrase upon the CREEDE. Since it befits that I account should give What way unto salvation I beleeve; Of my profession here the summe I gather. First, I confesse a Faith in God the Father: In God, who (without helper or partaker) Was of himselfe the worlds Almighty maker, And first gave time his being: who gave birth To all the Creatures both of heaven and earth Our everlasting welfare doth consist In his great mercies, and in Iesus Christ: (The second person of that Three in one) The Fathers equall and his onely Sonne; That ever blessed and incarnate Word, Which our Redeemer is, our life, our Lord. For when by Satans guile we were deceived, Christ was that meanes of help, which was conceived Yea (wh? we were in d?ger to be lost) Conceived for us, by the Holy Ghost. And that we might not ever be for-lorne, For our eternall safety he was Borne; Born as a Man (that man might not miscarry) Even of the substance of the Virgin Mary, And loe, a greater mercy, and a wonder; He that can make all suffer, suffered under The Iewish spite (which all the world revile at And Romish tyrannies of Pontius Pilate. In him doe I beleeve, who was envied, Who with extreamest hate was Crucified: Who being Life it selfe (to make assured Our soules of safety) was both dead and buried And that no servile feare in us might dwell, To conquer, He descended into hell: Where no infernall Power had power to lay Command upon him; but on the third day The force of death and hell he did constraine And so in Triumph, he arose againe. Yea the Almighty power advanc'd his head, Aswel above al things, as from the dead Then that from thence gifts might to men be given With glory, He ascended into heaven: Where that supreme and everlasting throne, Which was prepard, he climb'd; and sitteth on That blessed seate where he shall make abode To plead for us, at the right hand of God. And no where should he be entroned rather, Than there: for he is God, as is the Father. And therefore with an equal love delight I To praise &amp; serve them both, as one Almighty Yet in their office there's a difference, And I beleeve that Iesus Christ, from thence, Shall in the great and universall doome, Returne, and that with Angels. He shall come, To question such as at his Empire grudge; Even those who have presumed him to judge And that black day shall be so Catholicke, As I beleeve not onely that the quick To that assise shall all be summoned; But, he will both adjudge them, and the dead. Moreover, in the God-head I conceive Another Person, in whom I beleeve: For all my hope of blessednesse were lost, If I beleev'd not in the Holy Ghost. And though vain schismaticks through pride and folly Contemne her power, I doe beleeve the holy Chast spouse of Christ for wh? so many search By marks uncertain the true Cath'like Church I doe beleeve (God keepe us in this union) That there shall be for ever the Communion Of Gods elect: and that he still acquaints His children in the fellowship of Saints. Though damned be m?s nature or condition By grace in Christ I looke for the remission Of all my soule misdeeds; for there begins Deaths end, which is the punishment of sins, Moreover, I the Sadduces infection Abhorre and doe beleeve the resurrection: Yea, though I turn to dust; yet through God I Expect a glorious rising of the body; And that, exempted from the cares here rife, I shall enjoy perfection and the life That is not subject unto change or wasting; But ever blessed and for everlasting. This is my faith, which that it faile not wh? It most should steed me, let God say, Amen. To wh? that he so much vouchsafe we may, Thus as a member of his Church, I pray Lord at thy mercy seat our selves we gather, To doe our duties unto thee Our Father. To whom all praise, all honour should be given: For thou art that great God which art in heaven. Thou by thy wisdome rul'st the worlds whole frame For ever therefore, Hallowed be thy Name. Let never more delayes devide us from Thy glories view, but let Thy kingdome come. Let thy commands opposed be by none, But thy good pleasure, and Thy will be done. And let our promptnesse to obey, be even The very same in earth, as 'tis in heaven. Then for our selves, O Lord, we also pray, Thou woul'st be pleased to Give us this day, That food of life wherewith our soules are fed, Contented raiment, and our daily bread. With ev'ry needfull thing doe thou relieve us: And of thy mercy, pitty And forgive us All our misdeeds in him whom thou didst please, To take in offering for our trespasses. And for as much, O Lord, as we beleeve, Thou so wilt pardon us, as we forgive: Let that love teach us, wherewith thou acquaints us, To pardon all them, that trespasse against us. And though sometimes thou find'st we have forgot This love, or thee; yet helpe, And leade us not. Through soule or bodies want, to desperation Nor let aboundance, drive into temptation, Let not the soule of any true Beleever, Fall in the time of tryall: But deliver Yea save him from the malice of the devill; And both in life and death keepe us from evill. Thus pray we Lord: And but of thee, from whom Can this be had? For thine is the kingdome. The world is of the workes the graven story, To thee belongs the power, and the glory. And this thy happinesse hath ending never; But shall remaine for ever, and or ever. This we confesse, and will confesse agen, Till we shall say eternally, Amen. Thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and upon thy gates. Deut. 69. FINIS. Wither's Motto The Explanation of the Embleme. This little Embleme here doth represent, The blest condition, of a man content. The Place he lyes on, is a mighty Rocke: To shew that he contemnes and makes a mocke Of Force, or Vnderminers. We expresse, What others thinke him, by his Nakednesse. His Mantle with Hearts-ease ywrought, doth show, What He, doth of his owne well-being know. The Pillar, on whose Base, his head doth rest; Hath Fortitude and Constancie exprest. The Cornu-Copia that so neere him lyes; Declares, that He enough hath to suffice: And that he can be pleas'd, with what the Fields, Or what the fruitfull Tree, by Nature yeelds. That pleasant Prospective, in which you see, Groves, Rivers, Laundes, and Palaces there be; Lyes farre below Him; and is that, in which The truest happy Man is seldome rich. The words, NEC HABEO, he doth there bestow And what he meanes, doth with his finger show. Above him hover Angels, and his Eye, He fixing, on the glorious Heavens on high; (From whence a Ray into his brest descends) His other word, NEC CAREO, thither sends: To intimate, that He can nothing need, Whom Angels guard, and God himselfe doth feed: By force, or slye Temptations, to prevaile Both Temporall, and Ghostly Foes assaile, His naked person' but without a wound, Their Darts are broake; or, backe on them rebound. So with NEC CVRO, Those he entertaines: And to expresse, how highly He disdaines The best Contents, the World affoord him may; A Globe Terrestriall he doth spurne away. Wither's Motto. Nec Habeo, nec Careo, nec Curo. Nor Have I, nor Want I, nor Care I. Hah! will they storme? why let th?; who needs care? Or who dares frown on what the Muses dare, Who when they list can for a tempest call, Which thunder louder then their fury shall? And if men causelesly their power contemne, Will more then mortall vengeance fling on them? With thine owne trembling spirit, thou didst view These free-borne lines; that doubtst what may ensue: For if thou selest the temper of my soule, And knewst my heart, thou wouldst not feare controul. Doe not I know, my honest thoughts are cleare From any private spleene, or malice here? Doe not I know that none will frowne at this, But such as have apparant guiltinesse; Or such as must to flame and ruine runne, As some, once ayming at my fall have done? And can I feare those Idle scar-crowes then? Those bugg-beare perils, those meere shades of men? At whose displeasure they for terror sweat, Whose heart upon the worlds vaine love is set? No; when this Motto first, I mine did make, To me I tooke it, not for fashions sake: But that it might expresse me as I am, And keepe me mindefull to be still the same. Which I resolve to be: For, could the eye Of other men within my breast espie My resolution, and the Cause thereof; They durst not at this boldnesse make a scoffe. Shall I be fearefull of my selfe to speake; For doubt some other may exceptions take? If this age hold; ere long we shall goe neere Of ev'ry word of our, to stand in feare. And (five to one) if any should confesse Those sinnes in publike, which his soule oppresse: Some guilty fellow (moou'd thereat) would take it Vnto himselfe; and so, a Libell make it. Nay; We shall hardly be allowd to pray Against a crying-sinne; lest great men may Suspect, that by a figure we intend To point out them: and how they doe offend: As I have hope to prosper; e're I'le fall To such a bondage, I'le adventure all: And make the whole world mad, to heare how I Will fearelesse write and raile at Villany. But oh! beware (gray hayrd discretion sayes) The Dogge fights well that out of danger playes. For now, these guilty Times so captious be, That such, as love in speaking to be free; May for their freedome, to their cost be shent, How harmelesse er'e they be, in their intent: And such as of their future peace have care, Vnto the Times a little servile are. Pish, tell not me of Times, or danger thus: To doe a villany is dangerous; But in an honest action, my heart knowes No more of feares, then dead men doe of blowes. And to be slave to Times, is worse to me Then to be that, which most men feare to be. I tell thee Criticke, whatsoever Thou, Or any man, of me shall censure now: They, who for ought here written doe accuse, Or with a minde malitious, taxe my Muse; Shall nor by day awake, nor sleepe by night, With more contentment, in their glories height; Then I will doe, though they should lay me where I must in darkenesse, bolts of Iron weare, For, I am not so ignorant, but that I partly know what things I may relate: And what an honest man should still conceale, I know as well, as what he may reveale. If they be poore and base, that feare my straine: These poore base fellowes are afraid in vaine. I scorne to spurne a dogge, or strike a flye, Or with such Groomes to soile my Poesie. If great they were, and fallen; let them know, I doe abhor to touch a wounded foe. If on the top of honour yet they be: 'Tis poore weake honour, if ought done by me May blot, or shake the same: yea, whatsoere Their Titles cost, or they would faine appeare, They are ignoble, and beneath me farre; If with these measures they distempered are. For, if they had true Greatnesse, they would know, The spight of all the World, were farre below The seate of Noblest Honour, and that He In whom true worth and reall Vertues be, So well is arm'd: as that he feares no wrong From any Tyrants hand, or Villaines tongue. Much lesse be startled at those Numbers would; Where Uertue's praised, and proud Uice contrould. Is any man the worse if I expresse My Wants, my Riches, or my Carelesnesse? Or can my honest thoughts, or my content, Be turn'd to any mans disparagement, If he be honest? Nay, those men will finde A pleasure in this Picture of my minde, Who honour Vertue, and instead of blame, Will (as they have done) love me for the same. You are deceiv'd, if the Bohemian State You thinke I touch; or the Palatinate: Or that this ought of Eighty-eight containes; The Powder-plot, or any thing of Spaines: That their Ambassadour neede question me, Or bring me iustly for it on my knee. The state of those Occurrences I know Too well; my Raptures that way to bestow. Nor neede you doubt, but any friend you have, May play the foole, and if he lift the knave, For ought here written; For it is not such As you suppose; nor what you feare so much, If I had beene dispos'd to Satyrize, Would I have tam'd my Numbers in this wise? No: I have Furies that lye ty'de in chaines, Bold (English mastiffe like) adventrous Straines, Who fearelesse dare on any Monster flye, That weares a body of Mortality. And I had let them loose, if I had list, To play againe the sharpe fang'd Satyrist. That therefore you no more mis title This, I say, it is my Motto, and it is. I'le have it so: for, if it please not me; It shall not be a Satyr, though it be. What is't to you (or any man) if I, This little Poem terme as foolishly, As some men doe their children? Is it not Mine owne Minerva, of my braines begot? For ought I know, I never did intrude, To name your Whelpes, and if you be so rude, To meddle with my Kitling (though in sport) 'Tis oddes, but shee'l goe neere to scratch you for't. Play with your Monkey then, and let it lye: Or (if you be not angry) take it pray, And read it over. ? ?So, the Criticke's gone, Who at these Numbers carpt, and We alone: Proceede we to the matter.â Nec Habeo, nec Careo, nec Curo. Some having seene where I this Motto writ Beneath my Picture; ask't, what meaned it. And many in my absence, doe assay, What by these words, they best coniecture may: Some have supposed, that it doth expresse, An unadvised, desperate Carelesnesse. Some others doe imagine, that I meant In little, to set forth a great Content. Some, on each member of the Sentence dwell: And (first) will, what I have not, seeme to tell: What things I want not, they will next declare: And then they gesse, for what I doe not care. But that they might not from my meaning erre, I'le now become my owne Interpreter. Some things I haue, which here I will not show; Some things I want, which you shall never know: And sometime I (perchance) doe Carefull grow. But we, with that, will nothing have to doe. If good occasion be thereof to speake, Another time, we may the pleasure take. That, which to treat of, I now purpose (therefore,) Is what I neither have, nor want, nor care for. Nec Habeo. And first, that no man else may censure me, For vaunting what belongeth not to me: Heare what I have not; for, I'le not deny To make confession of my poverty. I have not of my selfe the power or grace, To be, or not to be; one minute-space. I have not strength another word to write, Or tell you what I purpose to indite: Or thinke out halfe a thought, before my death, But by the leave of him that gave me breath. I have no native goodnesse in my soul: But I was over all corrupt and foule, And till another cleans'd me, I had nought That was not stain'd within me: not a thought. J have no proper merit, neither will, Or to resolve, or act but what is ill. I have no meanes of safety, or content, In ought which mine owne wisedome can invent, Nor have I reason to be desperate tho: Because for this a remedy I know. J have no portion in the world like this, That I may breath that ayre, which common is: Nor have I seene within this spacious Round, What I have worth my Ioy or sorrow found. Except it hath for these that follow bin, The Love of my Redeemer, and my sinn. I none of those great Priviledges have, Which make the Minions of the Time, so brave. I have no sumptuous Palaces or Bowers That overtop my neighbours with their Towrs. I have no large Demeanes or Princely Rents, Like those Heroes, nor their discontents. I have no glories from mine Ancesters; For want of reall worth to bragge of theirs. Nor have I basenesse in my pedigree; For it is noble, though obscure it be. I haue no gold those honours to obtaine, Which men might heretofore, by Uertue gaine, Nor have I wit, if wealth were given me; To thinke bought Place or Title honour'd me. I (yet) have no beliefe that they are wise, Who forbase ends, can basely temporise: Or that it will at length be ill for me, That I liv'd poore, to keepe my Spirit free. I have no Causes in our Pleading Courts, Nor start I at our Chancery Reports. No fearefull Bill hath yet affrighted me; No Motion, Order, Iudgement, or Decree. Nor have I forced beene to tedious Iourneys, Betwixt my Counsellors and my Attourneys. I have no neede of those long-gowned warriers, Who play at Westminster, unarm'd at Barriers: Nor gamster for those Common pleas am I, Whose sport is marred by the Chancery. I have no iuggling hand, no double tongue; Nor any minde to take, or doe a wrong. I have no shifts or cunning sleights, on which I feed my selfe, with hope of being rich. Nor have I one of these, to make me poore; Hounds, Humors, running Horses, Hawkes, or Whore, I have no pleasure in acquaintance, where The Rules of State, and Ceremony, are Obseru'd so seriously; that I must dance, And act o're all the Complements of France And Spaine, and Italy; before I can Be taken, for a well-bred Englishman: And every time we meet, be forc't agen, To put in action that most idle Sceane. Mong these, much precious time (unto my cost) And much true-hearty meaning have I lost. Which having found: I doe resolve therefore, To lose my Time, and Friendship, so no more. I have no Complements; but what may show, That I doe manners and good breeding know. For much I hate, the forced, Apish tricks, Of those our home disdaining Politicks: Who to the Forraine guise are so affected, That English Honesty is quite rejected: And in the stead thereof, they furnisht home, With shadowes of Humanity doe come. Oh! how judicious in their owne esteeme, And how compleately; Travelled they seeme; If in the place of reall kindnesses, (Which Nature could have taught them to expresse) They can with gestures, lookes, and language sweet, Fawne like a Curtezan, on all they meet: And vie, in humble and kind speeches; when They doe most proudly, and most falsely meane. On this; too many falsely set their face, Of Courtship and of wisedome: but 'tis base. For, servile (unto me) it doth appeare, When we descend, to sooth and flatter, where We want affection: yea, I hate it more, Then to be borne a slave; or to be poore. I have no pleasure, or delight in ought, That by dissembling, must to passe be brought. If I dislike, I'le sooner tell them so, Then hide my face, beneath a friendly show. For he, who to be iust, hath an intent, Needs not dissemble, nor a lye invent. I rather wish to faile with honesty, Then to prevaile in ought by treachery. And with his minde I'le safer sleepe, then all Our Machavillian Polititians shall. I have no minde to flatter; though I might Be made some Lords companion; or a Knight. Nor shall my Verse for me on begging goe, Though I might starve, unlesse it did doe so. I have no Muses that will serve the turne, At every Triumph, and reioyce or mourne, Vpon a minutes warning for their hire; If with old Sherry they themselves inspire. I am not of a temper like to those, That can provide an houres sad talke in Prose, For any Funerall; and then goe Dine, And choke my griefe, with Sugar plums and Wine. I cannot at the Claret sit and laugh, And then halfe tipsie, write an Epitaph; Or howle an EpicÅdium for each Groome, That is, by Fraud or Nigardize, become A wealthy Alderman: Nor, for each Gull, That hath acquir'd the stile of Worshipfull, I cannot for reward, adorne the Hearse Of some old rotten Miser, with my Verse: Nor like the Poetasters of the Time, Goe howle a dolefull Elegie in Ryme, For euery Lord or Ladiship that dyes: And then perplexe their Heires, to Patronize That muddy Poesie. Oh! how I scorne, Those Raptures, which are free, and nobly borne, Should Fidler-like, for entertainement scrape At strangers windowes: and goe play the Ape, In counterfeiting Passion, when there's none, Or in good earnest, foolishly bemoane (In hope of cursed bounty) their just death; Who, (living) merit not a minutes breath To keepe their Fame alive, unlesse to blow Some Trumpet which their blacke disgrace may show. I cannot (for my life) my Pen compell, Vpon the praise of any man to dwell: Vnlesse I know, (or thinke at least) his worth, To be the same, which I have blazed forth. Had I some honest Suite, the gaine of which, Would make me noble, eminent, and rich: And that to compasse it, no meanes there were, Vnlesse I basely flattered some great Peere; Would with that Suite, my ruine I might get: If on those termes I would endeavour it. I have not bin to their condition borne, Who are inclined to respect and scorne, As men in their estates, doe rise or fall: Or rich, or poore, I Vertue love in all. And where I finde it not, I doe despise To fawne on them; how high so e're they rise: For, where proud Greatnesse without worth I see, Old Mordicay had not a stiffer knee. I cannot giue a Plaudit (I protest) When as his Lordship thinkes, he breakes a jeast, Vnlesse it move me, neither can I grin, When he a causelesse laughter doth begin. I cannot sweare him, truely honourable; Because he once receiv'd me to his table, And talk't as if the Muses glad might be, That the vouchsafed such a grace to me. His slender worth, I could not blazon so, By strange Hyperboles, as some would do. Or wonder at it, as if none had bin His equall, since King William first came in. Nor can I thinke true Uertue ever car'd To give or take, (for praise) what I have heard. For if we peyze them well; what goodly grace, Have outward Beauties, Riches, Titles, Place, Or such; that we, the owners should commend, When no true vertues, doe on these attend? If beautifull he be, what honour's that? As faire as he, is many a Beggers brat. If we, his noble Titles would extoll; Those Titles, he may have and be a foole. If Seats of Iustice he hath climb'd (we say) So Tyrants, and corrupt oppressors may. If for a large estate his praise we tell: A thousand Villanies, may be prais'd as well. If he, his Princes good esteeme be in; Why, so hath many a bloudy Traytor bin. And if in these things he alone excell, Let those that list upon his praises dwell. Some other worth I finde, e're I have sense Of any praise-deserving excellence. I have no friends, that once affected were, But to my heart, they sit this day as neare, As when I most endear'd them (though they seeme To fall from my opinion or esteeme:) For precious Time, in idle would be spent, If I with All, should alwaies complement. And till, my love I may to purpose show, I care not wher' they thinke I love or no. For sure I am, if any finde me chang'd; Their greatnesse, nor their meannesse me estrang'd. I have not priz'd mens loues, the lesse or more, Because I saw them, either rich or poore; But as their love and Vertues did appeare, I such esteem'd them, whosoe're they were. I have no trust, or confidence in friends, That seeke to know me, meerly for their ends, Nor have I ever said, I loved yet; Where I expected more then Love for it, And let me faile of that where most I lou'd, If that with greater joy I be not mou'd By twenty-fold, when I my kindnes show, Then when their favours they on me bestow. I have not that vile minde; nor shall my brest For ever, with such basenes be possest; As in my anger (be it ne're so iust) To utter ought committed to my trust In time of friendship; though constrained so, That want of telling it, should me undo. For, whosoe're hath trust repos'd in me; Shall ever finde me true, though false he be. I have no love to Country, Prince or Friend; That can be more, or lesse, or have an end. For whatsoever state they rais'd me to, I would not love them, better then I do. Nor can I hate them; though on me they should Heape all the scorne, and Iniury they could. I have no doting humour, to affect Where love I finde rewarded with neglect. I never was with melancholy sit Oppressed in such stupid manner, yet, As that ungently to my friends I spake; Or heed to their contentment did not take: Nor have I felt my Anger so inflam'd, But that with gentle speech it might be ram'd. I have no private cause of discontent, Nor grudge against the publike government. I have no spight, or envie in my brest, Nor doth anothers peace disturbe my rest. J have not (yet) that dunghill humour, which Some Great-men have; who, so they may be rich, Thinke all gaine sweet, and nought ashamed are, In vile, and rascall Suites to have a share. For I their basenesse scorne: and ever loath'd By wronging others, to be fed or cloath'd, Much more, to have my pride, or lust maintain'd, With what, by foule oppression hath beene gain'd. I have not beene enamor'd on the Fate Of men, to great advancements fortunate. I never yet a Favorite did see So happy, that I wished to be he: Nor would I, whatsoe're of me became, Be any other man, but who I am. For, though I am assur'd the destiny Of millions tendeth to felicity: Yet those deare secret comforts, which I finde, Vnseene, within the closet of my minde: Give more assurance of true happinesse, Then any outward glories can expresse. And 'tis so hard, (what shewes soe're there be) The inward plight of other men to see: That my estate, with none exchange I dare, Although my Fortunes more despised were. I have not hitherto divulged ought, Wherein my words dissented from my thought. Nor would I faile, if I might able be, To make my manners and my words agree. J have not beene ashamed to confesse My lowest Fortunes, or the kindnesses, Or poorest men: Nor have I proud beene made, By any favor from a great Man had. I have not plac't so much of my Content, Vpon the goods of Fortune, to lament The losse of them; more then may seemely be, To grieve for things, which are no part of me. For, I have knowne the worst of being poore, Yea lost, when I to lose have had no more, And though, the Coward World more quakes for feare Of Poverty, then any plagues that are: Yet, He that mindes his End, observes his Ward, The Meanes pursues, and keepes a heart prepar'd: Dares Scorne and Poverty as boldly meete, As others gladly Fame and Riches greet. For those, who on the stage of this proud World, Into the pawes of Want and Scorne are hurld: Are in the Master prize, that tryeth men; And Vertue fighteth her brav'st combat then. I no Antipathy (as yet) have had, Twixt me, and any Creature, God hath made: For if they doe not scratch, nor bite, nor sting, Snakes, Serpents, Todes, or Catts, or any thing I can endure to touch, or looke upon: (So cannot eu'ry one whom I have knowne.) I have no Nation on the earth abhor'd, But with a Iew or Spaniard can accord, As well, as with my Brother; if I finde He beare a Vertuous and Heroick minde. Yet (I confesse) of all men, I most hate Such, as their manners doe adulterate. Those Linsy-woolsie people, who are neither French, English, Scotsh, nor Dutch, but altogether. Those, I affect not; rather wish I could, That they were fish, or flesh, or hot, or cold: But none among all them, worse brooke I, then Our meere Hispaniolized English men. And if we scape their Treacheries at home, I'le feare no mischiefes, where so'ere I come. J have not fear'd who my Religion knowes: Nor ever for preferment, made I showes Of what I was not. For, although I may Through want, be forc't to put on worse array, Vpon my Body; I will ever finde Meanes to maintaine a habit for my Minde, Of Truth in graine: and weare it, in the sight Of all the world: in all the worlds despight. I, their presumption, have not, who dare blame A fault in others; and correct the same With grievous punishments: yet guilty be, Of those offences in more high degree. For, oh! how bold, and impudent a face, (And what unmoved hearts of Flint and Brasse) Have those corrupted Magistrates, who dare Vpon the seat of Iudgement sit; and there Without an inward horror preach abroad, The guilt of Sinne, and heavy wrath of God; (Against offenders pleading at their Barr) Yet know, what plott, within their bosomes are? Who, when (enthron'd for Iustice) they behold A reverend Magistrate, both grave, and old: And heare how sternly, he doth aggravate Each little crime, offenders perpetrate: How much the fact he seemeth to abhor; How he, a just correction labours for; How he admires, and wonders that among A people, where the Faith hath flourisht long Such wickednes should raigne which (he hath heard) The Heathen to commit, have bin affeard. Who that observes all this, would thinke that He Did but an houre before, receive a fee, Some Innocent (by law) to murther there? Or else, from Children fatherlesse to teare Their iust inheritance? and that when this Were done (as if that nought had beene amisse) He could goe sleepe upon a deed so foule; And neither thinke on mans, or Gods controule? I have not a stupidity so mad, And this presumption, I would no man had. I have no question made, but some there are, Who, when of this my Motto they shall heare; Will have a better stomacke, to procure That I may check, or punishment endure, Then their owne evill manners to amend: For that's a worke, they cannot yet intend. And though, they many view (before their face) Fal'ne, and each minute falling to disgrace; (For lesse offences farre then they commit) Without remorse, and penitence they sit. As if that They, (and they all one) had binne Without the compasse of reproofe of sinne. I have no great opinion of their wit, Nor ever saw their actions prosper, yet, Who wedded to their owne devices be, And will nor counsell heare, nor danger see, That is foretold them by their truest friends: But rather, list to them, who for their ends Doe footh their fancies. And the best excuse That such men can, to hide their folly use; (When all their idle projects come to nought) Are these words of the foole. I had not thought, I have not their delight, who pleasure take At Natures imperfections, scoffes to make. Nor have I bitternesse against that sinne, Which thorow weakenes hath committed bin. (For I my selfe, am to offences prone, And every day commit I many a one) But at their hatefull crimes I onely glance, That sinne of pleasure, pride, and arrogance. I have not so much knowledge as to call The Arts in question; neither wit so small, To waste my spirits, those things to attaine, Which all the world hath labour'd for in vaine. I have not so much beauty, to attract The eyes of Ladies: neither have I lackt Of that proportion which doth well suffice To make me gracious in good peoples eyes. I have not done, so many a holy deed; As that of IESVS CHRIST I have no need. And my good workes I hope are not so few, But that in me a living Faith they shew. I have not found ability so much, To carry Milstones; yea, and were it such, I should not greatly vaunt it: for in this, A scurvie pack-horse far my better is. I love his manly strength, that can resist His owne desires: force passages when he list, Through all his strong affections, and subdue The stout attempts of that rebellious crewe. This, were a braver strength then Sampson got: And this, I covet, but I have it not. I have not so much heedlesnes of things, Which appertaine unto the Courts of Kings; But that from my low station, I can see A Princes love may oft abused be. For many men their Country injure dare At home; where all our eyes upon them are, And (of the worlds Protector) I implore, The trust abroad, be not abused more. I have no Brother, but of yonger age, Nor have I Birth right without heritage: And with that land, let me inherit shame, Vnlesse I grieve when I possesse the same. The value of a penny have J not, That was by bribery or extortion got. I have no Lands that from the Church were pild, To bring (hereafter) ruine to my Child. And hitherto, I thinke, I have beene free From Widdowes, or from Orphants cursing me. The Spleene, the Collicke, or the Lethargy, Gouts, Palsies, Dropsies, or a Lunacy. I (by inheritance) have none of these: Nor raigning sinne; nor any foule disease. I have no debts, but such as (when I can) I meane to pay; nor is there any man (To whom I stand ingag'd by ought I borrow) Should losse sustaine though I should dye to morrow: And if they should (so much my friends they be) Their greatest losse they'le thinke the losse of me. And well they know, I tooke not what they lent, To wrong their loves, or to be idly spent. Except the Devill, and that cursed brood, Which have dependance on his Devil hood, I know no foes I have; for, if there be, In none, more malice, then I finde in me: The earth, that man (at this time) doth not beare Who would not, if some just occasions were; (Ev'n in his height of spleene) my life to save, Adventute with one foot, into his grave. To make me carefull; Children I have none, Nor have I any Wife to get them on; Nor have J, (yet to keepe her) had I one; Nor can this spoyle my Marriage being knowne. Since I am sure, I was not borne for her, That shall before my worth, her wealth prefer: For I doe set my Vertues at a rate, As high as any prise their Riches at. And if All count, the venture too much cost, In keeping it my selfe there's nothing lost. For, she I wed, shall somewhat thinke in me More worthy Love, then great revenues be. And if I finde not one, of such a minde, (As such indeed, are Iewels rare to finde) Ile clasped in mine owne embraces lye: And never touch a woman till I dye. For, shall a Fellow, whom (the Vsurer) His Father, by extortion did prefer Vnto an heritage in value cleare, Above foure times a thousand pounds a yeare, So worthily or so confident become? (By meanes of that his goodly annuall somme, Which may be lost to morrow) as to dare Attempt a Nymph of Honour for his pheare? Shall he; that hath with those foure thousand pounds A gaming vaine; a deepe mouth'd cry of Hounds, Three cast of Hawkes, of Whores as many brace, Sixe hunting Naggs, and five more for the race: (Perhaps a numerous brood of fighting-Cocks) Physitians, Barbers, Surgeons for the Pox; And twenty other humors to maintaine, (Besides the yeerely charges of his traine) With this revenue? Most of which, or all To morgage must be set? perhaps to sale To pay his creditors, and yet all faile To keepe his crasie body from the Iayle? Shall this dull Foole, with his uncertaine store (And in all honesty and Vertues poore) Hope for a Mistresse, noble, rich and faire? And is it likely that I can dispaire To be as happy, if I seeke it would? Who such a marchlesse fortune have in hold: That though the World my ruine plot and threat, I can in spight of it be rich, and great? A silly Girle, no sooner understands, That she is left in Portion, or in Lands; So large a fortune, that it doth excell The greatest part who neare about her dwell: But straight begins to rate, and prize her self According to the value of her pelf. And though no Gentry, nor good breeding born, Can all, that have estates beneath her, scorn. This wit a Woman hath: and shall not I, Who know I have a Wealth which none can buy For all the world; expect a nobler phere Then sutes unto a hundred pounds a yeere? Shall love of Truth, and Vertue make of me A match no better worthy, then is He Who knowes not what they meane? and doth possesse In outward fortunes neither more nor lesse? Have I oft heard so many faire ones plaine How fruitlesse Titles are? how poore and vaine They found rich greatnes, where they did not find, True Love, and the endowments of the mind? Have fairest Ladies often sworne to me That if they might, but onely, Mistresse be Of true affection; they would prize it more Then all those glories, which the most adore: Have I observ'd how hard it is to find A constant heart? a just and honest mind; How few good natures in the world there are, How scanty true affection is? how rare? And shall I passe as true a Heart away, As hath conceiv'd an honest thought to day: As if in value to no more it came, Then would endeare me to a vulgar Dame On equall termes? or else undoe me with Some old rich Croan, that hath out-liv'd her teeth? I'le rather breake it with proud scorne; that dead, The wormes may rifle for my Mayden-head. I have no love to beauties, which are gone Much like a Rose in Iune, as soone as blowne. Those painted Cabinets and nought within, Have little power my respect to win. Nor have I, yet, that stupid love to pelfe, As for the hope thereof, to yoke my selfe With any female; betwixt whom, and me, There could not in the soule, a marriage be. For whosoever joyne without that care; Fooles, and accursed in their matches are; And so are you, that either heare or view What I averre, unlesse you thinke it true. I have no meaning, whensoere I wed, That my companion, shall become my head. Nor would I (if I meant to keepe my right) So much as say so, though that win her might. Not though a Dutchesse: for the meanes I'le use To keepe my worth, though my reward I loose. Yea, from a prison had she raised me, Lord of her fortunes, and her Selfe to be: I that respect, would still expect to have, Which might become her Husband: not her slave. And should I spouse a Begger, I would shew, What love, and honor, to a wife were due. I have not, yet of any scorned bin; Whose good opinion, I have sought to win. Nor have I (when I meane to wooe) a feare, That any man shall make me willow weare. I have not eyes so excellent to see Things (as some men can do) before they be. Nor purblind sight, which crimes farre off can mark: Yet seeme, to faults which are more neare me, dark. I have not eares for every tale that's told, Nor memory, things frivolous to hold. I have not their credulity that dare Give credit unto all reports they heare. Nor have I subject to their dulnesse beene, Who can beleeeve no more then they have seene. I have no feeling of those wrongs that be By base unworthy fellowes, offered me: For my contentment, and my glory, lyes Above the pitch, their spight or malice flyes. I have not need enough as yet, to serve; Nor impudence to crave till I deserve. I have no hope, the worlds esteeme to get: Nor could a Foole, or Knave, e're brooke me yet. I have not villany enough, to prey Vpon the weake: or friendship to betray. Nor have I so much love to life, that I Would seeke to save it by dishonestly; I have not Cowardize enough to feare, In honest actions; though my death be there: Nor heart, to perpetrate a wilfull sinne: Though I with safety, large renowne might win: And for omitting it, were sure to dye, Ne're to be thought on, but with infamy. I have not their base cruelty, who can Insult upon an over-grieved man: Or tread on him, that at my feet doth bow, For, I protest, no villany I know That could be done me; but if I perceiv'd (Or thought) the doer, without faigning griev'd: I truely could forgive him; as if he Had never in a thought abused me. And if my love to mercy, I belye, Let God deny me mercy when I dye. I have not that unhappinesse, to be A Rich mans Sonne; For he had trained me In some vaine path; and I had never sought That knowledge which my poverty hath taught. I have no inclination to respect Each vulgar complement, nor yet neglect An honest shew of friendship: For, I sweare, I rather wish, that I deceived were; Then of so base a disposition be, As to distrust, till cause were given me: J have no Constitution, to accord To ought dishonest, sooner for a Lord Then for his meanest Groome; and hopes there be It never will be otherwise with me. I have no policies to make me seeme A man well worthy of the worlds esteeme. Nor have I hope, I shall hereafter grow To any more regard, for saying so; I have no doubt, though here a slighted thing, But I am favourite to Heav'ns great King. Nor have I feare, but all that's good in me, Shall in my Life, or Death, rewarded be. But yet I have not that attain'd, for which Those who account this nothing, thinke me rich? Nor that, which they doe reckon worth esteeme, To whom, the riches of the mind, doe seeme A scornefull Poverty. But let that goe, Men cannot prize the Pearles they doe not know. Nor have I power to teach them: for if I Should here consume my gift of Poesie: (And wholly wast my spirits, to expresse What rich contents, a poore estate may blesse) It were impossible, to move the sense Of those brave things, in their intelligence, I have not found, on what I may rely, Vnlesse it carry some Divinity To make me confident: for, all the glory, And all hopes foile, in things meere transitory. What man is there among us; doth not know A thousand men, this night to bed will goe, Of many a hundred goodly things possest; That shall have nought to morrow but a Chest, And one poore sheete to lye in? What I may Next morning have, I know not; But to day, A Friend, Meate, Drinke, and fitting Clothes to weare; Some Bookes, and Papers which my Iewels are; A Servant and a Horse, all this I have, And when I dye, one promist me a Grave. A Grave, that quiet closet of Content: And I have built my selfe a Monument. But (as I live) excepting onely this; (Which of my wealth the Inventory is) I have so little; I my oath might save: If I should take it, that I, nothing have: Nec Careo. And yet, whar Want I? or who knoweth how I may be richer made then I am now? Or what great Peere or wealthy Alderman, Bequeath, his sonne, so great a Fortune can? I nothing want that needfull is to have; Sought I no more, then Nature bids me crave. For, as we see, the smallest Vials may As full as greatest Glasses be; though they Much lesse containe: So, my small portion gives That full content to me; in which he lives, Who most possesseth: and with larger store, I might fill others, but my selfe no more. I want not Temperance, to rest content With what the providence of God hath lent; Nor want I a sufficiency, to know Which way to use it, if he more bestow. For, as when me, one horse would easier beare, To ride on two at once, it madnes were: And, as when one small Bowle might quench my thirst To lift a Vessell, that my backe might burst Were wondrous folly: So absurd a thing It were in me; should I neglect a Spring, (Whose plenty may a Countries want supply) To dwell by some small Poole that would be dry. If therefore, ought doe happen in the way; Which on a just occasion seeke I may: I want not resolution to make tryall, Nor want I patience, if I have deniall. Men aske me what Preferment I have gain'd, What riches, by my Studies are attain'd: And those that fed, and fatned are with draffe For their destruction; please themselves to laugh At my low Fate; as if I nought had got (For my enriching) cause they saw it not. Alas! that Mole-ey'd issue, cannot see, What Patrimonies are bestow'd on me. There is a braver wealthinesse, then what They (by abundance) have arrived at. Had I their wealth I should not sleepe the more Securely for it; and were I as poore In outward fortunes, as men shipwrackt are; I should (of poverty) have no more feare, Then if I had the riches and the powers Of all the Esterne Kings and Emperours: For, grasse though trod into the earth may grow; And highest Cedars have an overthrow. Yea, I have seene as many begger'd by Their fathers wealth; and much prosperity, As have by want mis-done. And for each one, Whom by his riches, I advanc't have knowne; I three could reckon, who through being poore, Have rais'd their Fortunes, and their friends the more. To what contents doe men most wealthy mount, Which I enjoy not; If their cares we count? My cloathing keepes me full as warme as their, My Meates unto my taste, as pleasing are, I feed enough my hunger to suffice: I sleepe, till I my seife am pleas'd to rise, My Dreames are sweet, and full of quiet be: My waking cares, as seldome trouble me. I have as oftentimes, a Sunny day: And sport, and laugh, and sing, aswell as they, I breath as wholsome and as sweet an ayre, As loving as my Mistresse, and as faire. My body is as healthy; and I finde As little cause of Sicknesse, in my minde, I am as wife, I thinke, as some of those; And oft my selfe as foolishly dispose: For, of the wisest, I am none (as yet) And I have nigh, as little hayre as wit: Of neither, have I ought to let to farme, Nor so much want J, as may keep me warm. I find my Liver sound, my joynts well knit: Youth, and good Diet, are my Doctors yet. Nor on Potatoes, or Eringoes feede I: No Meates restorative to raise me, neede I: Nor Amber greece, with other things confected, To take away the stinke of Lungs infected. I nev'r in need of Pothicary stood, Or any Surgeons hand to let me bloud: For since the Rod, my Tutor hurled by, I have not medled with Phlebotomy. As good as other mens, my senses be; Each limbe I have, as able is in me, And whether I, as lovely be, or no: Tis ten to one, but some doe thinke me so. The wealthiest men, no benefits possesse, But I have such, or better in their place. As they my low condition, can contemn; So, I know how to fling a scorne at them. My Fame, is yet as faire, and flyes as farre As some mens, that with Titles laden are. Yea, by myself much more I have attain'd, Then many, have with help of others gain'd. And my esteeme I will not change for their, Whose Fortunes are, ten thousand more a yeare. Nor want I so much grace, as to confesse, That God is Author of this happinesse. I want not so much iudgement, as to see There must 'twixt men and men a difference be, And I, of those in place, account do make, Though they be wicked) for good orders sake, But I could stoop to serve them at their feet, Where old Nobility, and Uertue meet. To finde mine owne defects, I want not sense: Nor want I will to grieve for my offence. To see my Friend misdoe, I want not eyes; Not Love, to cover his infirmities. I want not Spirit, if I once but know The way be iust, and noble that I goe. My mind's as great as theirs that greatest are; Yet, I can make it fit the clothes I weare. And whether I ascend, or lower fall. I want no hope but I preserve it shall. I want no slanders; neither want I braine, To scorne the Rascall humours, of the vaine And giddy multitude. And (trust me) they So farre unable are to talke away My resolutions, that no more it feares The worst their ignorance or malice dares: Then doth the Moone, when dogs and birds of night, Doe barking stand, or whooting at her light. And if this mischiefe, no way shun I could, But that they praise me, or dispraise me would: I rather wish, their tongues should blast my name; Then be beholding to them for my fame. I want nor wit, nor honesty enough To keep my hand from such base Rascall stuffe, As is a Libell: For, although I shall Sometime let flye, at Vice in generall; I spare particulars; Nor shall a Knave In my Lines live, so much as shame to have. But in his owne corruption, dye, and rot; That all his memory may be forgot. J want not so much Knowledge as to know True Wisdome lies not in a glorious show Of humane Learning; or in being able To cite Authorities innumerable. Nor in a new invention. But that man, Who make good use of ev'ry creature can: And from all things, that happen well or ill: Contentment drawes; (and keepes a conscience still, To witnesse his endeavours to be good,) That man is wisest; though he understood The language of no country but his owne, Nor ever had the use of Letters knowne. To make faire shewes, of Honesty and Arts; Of Knowledge and Religion are the parts This Age doth strive to play: but few there are, Who truely are the same they doe appeare. And this is that, which daily makes us see So many, whom we honest thought to be, And wise, and learned, (while some ScÃ¦nes doe last) Prove Fooles, and Knaves, before their Act be past. I want not sense, of those Mens miseries; Who lul'd a sleepe in their prosperities. Must shortly fall, and with a heavy eye Behold their pompe, and pleasures vanish by: And how that Mistresse, they so doted on (Their proud Vaine-glory) will with scorne be gon. I feele me thinkes with what a drooping heart, They, and their idle hopes begin to part And with what mighty burthens of unrest, Their poore distemperd soules will be opprest. How much they will repent, I doe foresee; How much confused, and asham'd they'le be, And as I praise their doome; ev'n so I pray, Their shame and sorrow, worke their comfort may. I want not much experiment, to show That all is good God pleaseth to bestow; (What shape soever he doth maske it in) For all my former cares, my ioyes have bin: And I have trust, that all my woes to come, Will bring my Soule, Eternall comforts home. I doe not finde, within me, other feares; Then what to men, of all degrees appeares. I have a conscience that is cleane within: For, (though I guilty am of many a sinne) A kinde Redeemer, I have found, and he His Righteousnesse impureth unto me: The Greatest, have no Greatnes, more then I, In bearing out a want, or Misery. I can as well, to passion set a bound: I brooke as well the smarting of a wound. Aswell endure I, to be hunger-bit; Aswell can wrestle with an Ague-fit. My eyes can wake as long as their I'me sure; And as much cold, or heat I can endure. Yea, let my dearest friends excused be, From heaping scorne, or Iniuries on me; (Come all the world) and I my heart can make, To brooke as much, before it shrinke, or breake As theirs, that doe the noblest Titles weare; And slight as much their frown that mighti'st are, For, if in me at any time appeare A bashfulnesse (which some mistitle, feare) It is no doubt, lest I through folly may Some things unfitting me; or doe, or say: But not that I am fearefull to be shent; For dread of Men, or feare of punishment. And yet, no faults J want; nor want in me, Affections which in other men there be: As much I hate an incivilitie; As much am taken with a Courtesie; As much abhor I, brutish Vanities; As much allow I, Christian Liberties; As soone an iniurie I can perceive; And with as free a heart I can forgive. My hand, in Anger, I as well can stay; And I dare strike as stout a man as they; And when I know, that I amisse have done, I am as much asham'd as any one. If my afflictions more then others be: I have more comforts to keepe heart in me. I have a Faith will carry me on high: Vntill it lift me to Eternity. I have a Hope, that neither want nor spight, Nor grim Adversity, shall stop this flight: But that undaunted, I my course shall hold, Though twenty thousand Devils crosse me should. Yet (I confesse) in this my Pilgrimage, I like some Infant am, of tender age. For, as the Childe, who from his Father hath Strai'd in some Grove, through many a crooked path: Is sometime hopefull that he findes the way; And sometime doubtfull, he runs more astray. Sometime, with faire and easie paths, doth meet; Sometime with rougher tracts, that stay his feet. Here runs, there goes, and yon amazed staies; Now cries, and straight forgets his care, and playes. Then hearing where his loving Father cals, Makes hast, but through a zeale il-guided, fals; Or runs some other way, untill that He (Whose love is more then his endevours be) To seeke this Wanderer forth, himselfe doth come, And take him in his armes, and beare him home. So, in this life, this Grove of ignorance, As to my homeward, I my selfe advance; Sometime aright, and sometime wrong I goe; Sometime my pace is speedy, sometime slow; Sometime I stagger, and sometime I fall: Sometime I sing, sometime for helpe I call. One while my waies are pleasant unto me; Another while, as full of cares they be: Now, I have courage, and doe nothing feare, Anon, my Spirits halfe dejected are. I doubt, and hope, and doubt and hope againe; And many a change of Passions I sustaine, In this my iourney: so, that now and then, I lost may seeme (perhaps) to other men. Yea, to my selfe awhile, when sinnes impure, Doe my Redeemers loue, from me obscure. But (whatsoe're betide) I know full well, My Father (who above the Clouds doth dwell) An eye upon his wandring Child doth cast; And He will fetch me to my home at last. For, of Gods love, a Witnesse want not I; And whom He loves, He loves eternally. I have within my breast a little heart, Which seemes to be composed, of a part Of all my Friends: For, (truely) whensoe're They suffer any thing, I feele it there. And they no sooner a Complaint doe make, But presently it fals to pant and ake. I have a Love, thae is as strong as Fate, And such, as cannot be empayrd by Hate. And (whatsoever the successe may prove) I want not yet, the comforts of my Love. These, are the Jewels that doe make me rich; These, while I doe possesse, I want not much: And I so happy am, that still I beare, These Riches with me: and so safe they are, That Pyrats, Robbers, no device of man, Or Tyrants powre, deprive me of them can. And were I naked, forced to exile; More Treasure, I should carry from this Ile; Then should be sold; though for it I might gaine, The wealth of all America and Spaine. For, this makes sweet my life, and when I die, Will bring the sleepe of Death on quietly. Yea, such as greatest pompe, in life time have; Shall find no warmer lodging in their Grave. Besides; I want not many things they need, Who Me in outward Fortunes doe exceed. I want no Guard, or Coate of Musket proofe; My Innocence is guardiant strong enough. J want no Title; for to be the Sonne, Of the Almighty, is a glorious one: I want no Followers; for, through Faith I see A troupe of Angels still attending me. Through want of friendship neede I not repine, For God, and good men, are still friends of mine. And when I iourney to the North, the East, The pleasant South, or to the fertile West; J cannot want for proffer'd Courtesies, As farre as our Great Britaines Empire lies. In every Shire, and Corner of the Land, To welcome me, doe Houses open stand, Of best esteeme: And Strangers to my face, Have thought me worth the Feasting, and more grace Then I will boast of: left you may suspect, That I those glories (which I scorne) affect. Of my acquaintance were a thousand glad, And sought it, though nor wealth, nor place I had, For their advantage. And, if some more high, (Who on the multitudes of friends relye) Had but a Fortune equall unto me, Their troupe of followers would as slender be: And those 'mong whom, they now esteeme have won, Would scarcely thinke them, worth the looking on. I want no Office; for (though none be voyde) A Christian findes, he may be still employ'd. J want no Pleasures, for I pleasures make, What ever God is pleas'd, I undertake. Companions want I not, For know, that I Am one of that renown'd Societie: Which by the Name we carry, first was knowne, At Antioch, so many yeeres agone. And greatest Kings, themselves have happy thought, That to this noble Order they were brought. I want not Armes, to fit me for the Field; My Prayers, are my Sword; my Faith, my Shield: By which, (how ere you prize them) I have got, Vnwounded, thorow twenty thousand Shot. And with these Armes, I heaven thinke to scale, Though Hell the Ditch were, &amp; more high the Wall. A thousand other priviledges more I doe possesse; in which the world is poore. Yea, I so long could reckon, you would grant, That though I nothing have, I nothing want. And did the King, but know how rich I were, I durst to pawne my Fortunes, he would sweare, That were he not the King, I had beene Hee Whom he (of all men) would have wisht to be. Nec Curo. Then, to vouchsafe me yet more fovour here; He that supplies my Want, hath tooke my Care: And when to bar me ought, he sees it fit, He doth infuse a Mind to sleight at it. Why, if He all things needfull doth bestow, Should I for what I have not, carefull grow? Low place I keepe; yet to a Greatnesse borne, Which doth the Worlds affected Greatnesse scorne: I doe disdaine her glories, and contemne Those muddy spirits that delight in them: I care for no mans Countenance, or grace, Vnlesse he be as good, as great in place. For no mans spight or envy doe I care; For none have spight at me, that honest are. I care not for that baser wealth, in which Vice may become, as well as Vertue rich. I care not for their friendship who have spent, Loves best expressions, in meere Complement: Nor for those Favors (though a Queenes they were) In which I thought another had a share. I care not for their praise, who doe not show, That in their lives, which they in words allow. A rush I care not who condemneth me; That sees not what my Soules intentions be. I care not though to all men knowne it were, Both whom I love, or hate; For none I feare. I care not though some Courtlers still preferre The Parasite, and smooth tongu'd Flatterer, Before my bold, truth-speaking Lines; and here If these should anger them, I doe not care. I care not for that goodly Pretious Stone, Which Chymists have so fondly doted on. Nor would I give a rotten Chip, that I Were of the Rosy Crosse, Fraternity: For, I the world too well have understood, As to be guld with such a Brother-hood. I care for no more knowledge, then to know What I to God and to my Neighbour owe. For outward Beauties I doe nothing care. So I within, may faire to God appeare: No other liberty I care to winne, But to be wholy freed from my sinne. Nor more Abilitie (whilst I have breath) Then strength to beare my Crosses to my death, Nor can the Earth affoord a happinesse That shall be greater then this Carelesnesse. For such a Life I soone should Carelesse grow, In which I had not leasure more to know. Nor care I, in a knowledge paines to take, Which doth not those, who get it, wiser make: Nor for that Wisedome, do I greatly care, Which would not make me somewhat honester. Nor for that morall Honestie, that shall Refuse to joyne Religion, therewithall. Nor for that zealous seeming Piety, Which wanteth love and morall Honesty. Nor for their Loves, whose base affections be, More for their lust, then for ought good in me. Nor, for ought good within me should I care, But that they sprincklings of Gods goodnesse are. For many Bookes I care not; and my store Might now suffice me, though I had no more, Then Gods two Testaments, and therewithall That mighty Volume, which the World we call. For, these well lookt on, well in minde preserv'd; The present Ages passages observ'd: My private Actions, seriously oreview'd. My thoughts recald, and what of them ensu'd: Are Bookes, which better farre, instruct me can, Then all the other Paper-workes of man: And some of these, I may be reading to, Where e're I come, or whatsoe're I do. I care not though a sight of idle Guls, (With lavish tongues, and ever empty sculs) Doe let my better-tempered Labours lye; And since, I Termely make not Pamphlets flye, Say I am idle, and doe nothing now, As if that I were bound to let Them know, What I were doing; Or to cast away My breath, and Studies, on such fooles as They. I much disdaine it: for, these Blockes be Those, That use to read my Verse like ragged Prose; And such as (so their Bookes be new) ne're care Of what esteeme, nor of what use they are. I care not, though a vaine and spungy crew, Of shallow Critickes, in each Taverne spew Their drunken censures on my Poesie, Vntill among their Cupps, they sprawling lye These poore, betattered Rimers (now and then) With Wine and Impudence inspired can Some sustain language utter, which doth seeme (Among their base admirers) worth esteeme. But those base Ivie-Poets never knew, Which way, a sprightly, honest Rapture flew: Nor can they relish any straine of wit, But, what was in some drunken fury writ. Those needy Poetasters, to preferre Their nasty stuffe to some dull Stationer; With Impudence extoll it: and will tell him, The very Title of their booke shall sell him, As many thousands of them (wholly told) As ever of my Satyrs, have been sold, Yet, e're a twelve moneth by the walls it lyes, Or to the Kitchin or the Pastry hies. Sometime, that these mens Rymes may heeded be, They give (forsooth) a secret I erke at me. But so obscurely, that no man may know, Who there was a meant, untill they tell them so. For fearing me, They dare not to be plaine, And yet my vengeance they suspect in vaine. For I can keepe my way, and carelesse be, Though twenty snarling Curres doe barke at me. And while my Fame, those fooles doe murmur at, (And vex themselves) with laughing, I am fat. I am not much inquisitive to know, For what brave Action our last Fleet did go: What men abroad performe, or what at home, Who shall be Emperour, or Pope of Rome; What newes from France, or Spaine, or Turkey are: Whether of Merchandize, of Peace or Warre; Whether Mogul, the Sophy, Prester Iohn, The Duke of China, or the Ile Iaphan The mightier be for, things impertinent To my particular, or my Content I little heed (though much thereof I know) Nor care I whether it be true or no. Not for because I carelesse am become, Of the neglected State of Christendome. But, cause (I am assur'd) what ever shall Vnto the Church, Common-wealth befall; (Through Sathans spight, or humane Trechery, Or, our relying on weake Policy) Gods promise to his glory shall prevaile: Yea, when the fond attempts of men doe fayle, And they lye smoaking, in th' infernall Pit; Then Truth and Uertue shall in glory sit. Those, who in love to things that wicked are; And those, who thorow Cowardize and feare, Became the damned Instruments, whereby To set up Vice and falsehoods Tyranny; Ev'n those shall perish by their owne offence: And they who loved Truth and Innocence, Out of oppression shall advance their head: And on the ruines of those Tyrants tread. Oh! let the Truth and Innocence, in me For ever undefil'd preserved be: And let me live no more; if then I care How many miseries I live to beare, For, well I know, I should not weigh how great The perils are, thas my destruction threat. Nor chaynes nor dungeons should my soule affright, Nor grimmest Apparitions of the night: Though men from hell could of the Devill borrow, Those ugly prospects, to augment my sorrow. But prove me guilty; and my Conscience than Inflicts more smart, then bloudy Tortures can. And none (I thinke) of me could viler deeme, Then I my selfe, unto my selfe should seeme. If good and honest my endevours be, What day they were begun ne're troubles me. I care not whether it be calme, or blow, Or raine, or shine, or freeze, or haile, or snow: Nor whether it be Autumne, or the Spring; Or whether, first I heare the Cuckow sing, Or first the Nightingale: Nor doe I care Whether my dreames of Flowers, or Weddings are; What Beast doth crosse me, care I not at all; Nor how the Goblet, or the Salt doth fall; Nor what aspect the Planets please to show, Nor how the Diall, or the Clocke doth goe. I doe not care to be inquisitive, How many weeks, or months, I have to live. For, how is't like, that I should better grow, When I my Time shall twelve month longer know; If I dare act a Villany, and yet, Know I may die, whilst I am doing it? Let them, whose braines are sicke of that disease, Be slaves unto an Ephemerides. Search Constellations, and themselves apply, To finde the Fate of their Nativity. I'le seek within me; and if there I find Those Stars, that should give light unto my mind, Rise faire and timely in me, and affect, Each other with a naturall aspect; If in conjunction, there perceive I may True Vertue and Religion every day: And walke according to that influence, Which is derived unto me from thence: I feare no Fortunes, whatsoe're they be, Nor care I, what my Stars doe threaten me. For He, who to that State can once attaine, Above the power of all the Starres doth raigne: And he that gaines a knowledge where we shall, He is prepar'd for whatsoe're may fall: In my conceit is farre a happier man, Then such, as but foretell misfortunes can. I start not at a Friers Prophecy, Or those with which we Merlin do bely. Nor am I frighted with the sad relation, Of any neare approaching alteration. For things have ever chang'd, and ever shall, Vntill there be a change run over All. And he that beares an honest heart about him, Needs never feare, what changes be without him. The Easterne Kingdomes had their times to flourish, The Grecian Empire rising, saw them perish; That fell, and then the Roman pride began; Now scourged by the race of Ottoman. And if the course of things around must run, Till they have ending, where they first begun, What is't to me? who peradventure must, Ere that befall, lie moulther'd into dust. What if America's large Tract of ground, And all those Iles adjoyning, lately found? (Which we more truely may a Desert call. Then any of the worlds more civill Pale.) What then? if there the Wildernesse doe lye, To which the Woman and her Sonne must flie, To scape the Dragons furie; and there bide, Till Europes thankelesse Nations (full of pride, And all abhomination) scourged are, With Barbarisme as their neighbours were? If thus God please to doe; and make our sin The cause of bringing other Peoples in, His Church to be (as once he pleased was, The Gentiles calling should be brought to passe, The better, by the Iewish vnbeliefe,) Why, should his pleasure be my care or griefe? Oh! let his Name and Church more glorious grow, Although my ruine helpe to make it so. So I, my duty in my place have done, I care not greatly, what succeed theron: For sure I am, if I can pleased be, With what God wills; all shall be well for me. I hate to have a thought o're-serious spent, In things meere triviall, or indifferent. When I am hungry, so I get a dish, I care not, whether it be flesh or fish; Or any thing, so wholsome food it be: Nor care I, whether you doe carve to me, The head, the tayle, the wing, the legge, or none For, all I like, and all can let alone. I care not, at your Table where I sit; Nor should I thinke I were disgrac't in it, (So much as you) if I should thence in scoffe, To feed among your Groomes be turned off. For I am sure that no affront can blot His reputation, that deserves it not. To be o're curious, I doe not professe, Nor ever car'd I, for uncleanlinesse. For I ne're loved that Philosophy, Which taught men to be rude and slovenly. I care not what yon weares, or You, or He, Nor of what fashion my next clothes shall be, Yet to be singular in Antique fashions, I hold as vaine, as Apish imitations, Of each phantastique garb our Gallants weare: For some, as fondly proud conceited are, To know, that the beholder taketh note, How they still keepe their Grandsires russet Coate: As is the proudest Lady, when that she Hath all the fashions, that last extant be. I care for no more Credit, then will serve The honour of the Vertuous to preserve: For, if the showes of honesty in me, To others Vertues, would no blemish be; (Nor make them deemed Hypocrites) if I Should falsly be accus'd of Villany: Sure, whether I were innocent, or no; I should not thinke the world worth telling so, Because to most men, nothing had doth see me, Nor nothing vertuous; but as unto them, Occasion makes it good, or ill appeare. Yea, foulest Crimes, while they unpunisht are: Or bring in profit, no disgrace are thought; And truest Vertues, poore, are set at naught. I care for no more pleasures then will make, The Way which I intend to undertake, So passible; that my unwealdy loade Of frailties, incident to flesh and blood Discourage not my willing soule from that, Which she on good advice hath aymed at. I care for no more Time then will amount, To dee my worke, and make up my account. I care for no more money, then will pay The reckoning, and the charges of the day. And if I neede not now, I will not borrow, For feare of wants, that I may have to morrow. What Kings, and States-men meane, I doe not care; Nor will I iudge what their intentions are: For private censures, helpe not any way, But iniure them in their proceedings may, Yet, Princes (by experience) we have seen, By those they love, have greatly wronged been. Their too much trust, doth often danger breed, And Serpent in their Royall bosoms feed. For, all the favours, gifts and places, which Should honour them; do but these men inrich. With those, they further their owne private ends: Their faction strengthen, gratifie their friends: Gaine new Associates, daily to their parts, And from their Soveraigne, steale away the hearts Of such as are about them; For those be Their Creatures; and but rarely, thanks hath He, Because the Grants of Pension, and of Place, Are taken as Their favours, not His grace. And (which is yet a greater wickednesse) When these the loyall Subjects doe oppresse, And grind the faces of the poore, aliue; They'le doe it, by the Kings Prerogative. They make Him Patron of their Villany; And when He thinkes they serve him Faithfully, Secure him in their loves, and all things do, According both to Law and Conscience to; By Vertue of his Name, they perpetrate A world of Mischiefes: They abuse the State; His truer-hearted Servants, they displace; Bring their debauched Followers into grace; His Coffers rob; (yea worser far they use Him) The true affections of his people loose Him: And make those hearts (which did in him believe, All matchlesse Vertues) to suspect, and grieve. Now, (by that Loyalty I owe my Prince) This of all Treason, is the Quintessence. A Treason so abhorred, that to Me, No Treachery could halfe so odious be. Not though my death they plotted; for more deare, My honor, and my Friends affections are, Then twenty Kingdomes, and ten thousand lives. And, whosoever, Me of that deprives: I find it would, a great deale harder be, To move my heart to pardon; then if he Conspired had, (when I least thought the same) To root out my posterity and Name. Who next in Court shall fall, I doe not care: For, my delights, in no mans ruines are. Nor meane I, to depend on any, so, That his disgrace shall be my overthrow. I care as little, who shall next arise; For none of my Ambition that way lyes, Those rising Starres would never deigne to shine On any good endeavour, yet, of mine. Nor can I thinke there shall hereafter be, A man amongst them, that will favour Me. For, I a Scourge doe carry, which doth feare them, And love too much Plaine-dealing, to be neare them: If my experience teach me any thing, I care not old Antiquities to bring; But can as well beleeve it to be so, As if't were writ, three thousand yeeres ago, And where I find good ground for my assent, I'le not be halter'd to a President. If men speake reason, 'tis all one to me, Whether their Tenent, Aristotles be; Or some Barbarians, who scarce heard of yet; So much as with what Names the Arts we fit. Or whether, for an Author you infer, Some Foole, or some renown'd Philosopher. In my Religion, I dare entertaine No fancies hatched in mine owne weake braine Nor private Spirits: But am ruled by The Scriptures: and that Church Authoritie, Which with the ancient Faith doth best agree, But new opinions will not downe with me. When I would learne, I never greatly care, So Truth they teach me, who my teachers were: In points of Faith I look not on the Man; Nor Beza, Calvin, neither Luther can More things, without just proofe perswade me to, Then any honest Parish-Clarke can do. The ancient Fathers (where consent I find) Doe make me, without doubting of their mind, But, where in his opinion any One Of these great Pillars, I shall find alone, (Except in questions which indifferent are, And such as till his Time, unmooved were) I shun his Doctrine; For, this swayeth me, No man alone in points of Faith can be. Old Ambrose, Austine, Ierome, Chrysostome, Or any Father; if his Reverence come, To move my free assent to any thing, Which Reason warrants not (unlesse he bring The sacred word of God to give me for it) I prize not his opinion; but abhor it. Nay, I no faction 'gainst the Truth would follow, Although Divinest Paul, and Great Apollo, Did leade me; if that possible it were, That they should have permitted bin to erre. And whilst that I am in the right (I care not How wise, or learned, Them, you think, that are not. J care not who did heare me, if I said, That he who for a place of Iustice paid A golden Inn come, was no honest Man, Nor he that sold it: for I prove it can, And will maintaine it, that so long as Those, And Church preferments, we to sale expose; Nor Common-wealth, nor Church shall ever be, From hatefull Brib'ry, or damn'd Schisme, free. I may be blam'd perhaps, for speaking this; But much I care not: for the truth it is. And were I certaine, that to blaze the same, Would set those things (that are amisse) in frame; Shame be my end but I would undertake it, Though I were sure to perish when I spake it. I care not for Preferments which are sold, And bought (by men of common worth) for gold, For, he is nobler who can those contemne, Then most of such, as seek esteem in them. I doe not for those ayrie Titles care, Which fooles, and knaves, as well as I may weare. Or that my Name (when e're it shall be writ) Should be obscur'd with twenty after it. For could I set my mind on vulgar Fame, I would not thinke it hard to make my Name, Mine owne Name, purchase me as true renowne, As to be cal'd, by some old ruin'd Towne. I love my Country, yet I doe not care, In what Dominions my abidings are: For, any Region on the Earth shall be, (On good occasion) native Soile to me. I care not though there be a muddy crew, Whose blockishnesse (because it never knew The ground of this my Carelesnesse) will smile, As if they thought I raved, all this while. For, those the Proverb saith, That live in Hell, Can ne're conceive what 'tis in Heaven to dwell. I care not for those Places, whereunto Bad men doe sooner climbe then Good men do: And from whose ever-gogling station, all May at the pleasure of another fall. But oh! How carelesse every way am I, Of their base minds, who living decently Vpon their owne demeanes; there fearelesse might Enjoy the day from morning untill night. In sweet contentments: rendring praise to Him, Who gave this blessing, and this rest to them; That free from Cares and Envies of the Court, They honor'd in their Neighbours good report; Might twenty pleasures, that Kings know not, trie, And keepe a quiet Conscience till they die? Oh God! how mad are they, who thus may do; Yet, that poor happinesse to reach unto, Which is but painted; will those Blessings shun, And bribe and woo, and sweate to be undone? How dull are they? Who, when they home may keep, And there upon their own soft pillow sleep, In deare security; would roame about, Vncertaine hopes, or pleasures to find out? Yea, straine themselves a slippery place to buy, With hazarding their states to beggery? With giving up, their Liberties, their Fame? With their adventuring on perpetuall shame: With prostituting Neeces, Daughters, Wives, By putting into jeopardy their lives? By selling of their Country, and the sale Of Iustice, of Religion, Soule and All? Still dreaming on Content; although they may Behold by new examples, ev'ry day, That those hopes faile, and faile them not alone, In such vaine things as they presumed on; But bring them also (many times) those cares, Those sad distractions, those dispaires and feares; That all their glorious guilding, cannot hide Those wofull ruines, on their inner-side. But, ten to one, at length they doe depart, Withlosse, with shame, and with a broken heart. I care not for this Humour, but I had Far rather lye in Bedlam chain'd and mad, Then be, with these mens frantique mood possest: For there they doe lesse harme, and have more rest. J care not when there comes a Parliament: For I am no projector, who invent New Monopolies, or such Suits, as Those, Who, wickedly pretending goodly showes, Abuses to reforme, engender more; And farre lesse tollerable, then before. Abusing Prince, and State, and Common weale; Their (iust deserved) beggeries to heale: Or, that their ill got profit, may advance To some Great Place, their Pride, and Ignorance. Not by Extortion, nor through Bribery, To any Seat of Iustice, climb'd am I; Nor live I so, as that I need to care,, Though my proceedings, should be question'd there. And some there be, would give their Coat away, That they could this as confidently say. I care for no such thriving Policy, As makes a foole of Morall Honesty. For, such occasions happen now and than: That He proves Wise, that proves an Honest man. And howsoere our Proiect-mongers deeme Of such mens Fortunes, and of them esteeme; (How big soe're they looke; how brave soe're, Among their base Admirers they appeare: Though ne're so trimme, in others feathers dight, Though clad with Title of a Lord, or Knight; And by a hundred thousand croucht unto) Those gaudy Vpstarts, no more prize, I doe, Then poorest Kennel-rakers; yea, they are Things, which I count, so little worth my care; That (as I loue faire Vertue) I protest, Among all honest men the beggerl'est, And most betatter'd Pesant, in mine eye, Is Nobler, and more full of Majestie Then all that brave bespangl'd Rabblement, Compos'd of Pride, of Shifts, and Complement. Let great and Courtly Pers'nages delight, In some dull Gestor, or a Parasite; Or in their dry Buffoone, that gracefully, Can sing them baudy songs, and sweare, and lye; And let their Mastership (if so they please) Still favour more, the slauerings of These, Then my free Numbers. For, I care no more, To be approved, or esteemed, for A witty Make-sport; than an Ape to be. And whosoever takes delight in me, For any quality that doth affect His Senses better, then his Intellect; I care not for his love. My dogge doth so, He loves, as farre as sensuall love can go. And if how well he lov'd me, I did weigh. Deserves (perhaps) as much respect, as they. I have a Soule, and must beloved be For that which makes a lovely Soule in me; Or else, their Loves, so little care I for, That them, and their affections I abhor. J care not, though some Fellowes, whose desert Might raise them to the Pillory, or Cart, The Stocks, the Branding-yron, or the whip, (With such like due Preferment) those doe skip, And by their black endeavours purchase can, The Priviledges of a Noble man And be as confident, in what they doe: As if by vertue they were rais'd thereto. For, as true Vertue hath a confidence, So Vice, and villanies have their impudence. And manly Resolution, both are thought, Till both are to an equall Tryall brought; But vicious Impudence, then proves a mocke: And Vertuous Constancy, endures the Shocke Though such unworthy Groomes, who t'other day, Were but their Masters Panders to purvey The fuell of their Lust; and had no more, But the reversion of their meat, their Whore, And their old cloathes to brag of. Though that these, (The foes to Vertue, and the times disease) Have now, to cover o're their knavery, Got on the Robes of Wealth and bravery; And dare behave their Rogueships sawcily, In presence of our old Nobility: As if they had been born to act a part, In the contempt of Honour, and Desart, Though all this be, and though it often hath Discourag'd many a one, in Uertues Path, I am the same, and Care not: For I know, Those Butter-flies, have but a time to show Their painted wings, that when a storme is neare, Our habits, which for any weather are, May shew more glorious, whilst they shrinking lye, In some old crevise, and there starve and dye. Those Dues, which unto Uertue doe belong, He that despiseth, offers Uertue wrong. So, he that followes Vertue for rewards; And more the Credit, then the Act regards (Or such esteeme as others seeke, doth misse) Himselfe imagines worthier then He is. If therefore, I can tread the way I ought; J care not how ignoble I be thought: Not for those Honours doe I care a flye, Which any man can give me, or deny: For what I reckon worth aspiring to, Is got and kept, where others will or no. And all the world can never raise a man To such brave heights 'as his owne Vertues can. I care not for that Gentry, which doth lye In nothing but a Coat of Heraldry. One Vertue more I rather wish I had, Then all the Heralds to mine Armes could add: Yea, I had rather, by my industry, I could acquire some one good quality, Then through the Families that noblest be From fiftie Kings to draw my Pedigree. Of Nations, or of Countries, I nought care, To be Commander; my Ambitions are, To have the Rule, and Soveraignty of things, Which doe command great Emperours, and Kings. Those strong, and mighty Passions wherwithall Great Monarchs have bin foyld, and brought in thrall I hope to trample on. And whilst that they Force but my body (if I disobey) I rule that Spirit; which would they constraine Beyond my will, They should attempt in vaine. Yea, whilst they bounded within limits here, On some few Mortals, only domineer, Those Titles, and that Crowne, I doe pursue, Which shall the Devils to my power subdue. I care not for that Ualour, which is got By furious Choller, or the Sherry pot. Nor (if my Cause be ill) to heare men say, I fought it out, even when my bowels lay Beneath my feet. A desperatenesse it is, And there is nothing worthy praise in this; For I have seene (and you may see it to) That any Mastiffe dogge as much will doe. He valiant is, who knowes the dis-esteeme, The vulgar have of such as Cowards seeme. And yet dares seeme one, rather then bestow Against an honest cause, or word or blow: Though, else he fear'd no more, to fight, or die, Then you to strike a Dogge, or kill a Flie. Yea, him I honour, who new wak't from sleeping, Finds all his Spirits so their temper keeping, As that he would not start, though by him there, Grim Death, and Hell, and all the Deuils were. J care not for a Coward, for to me, No Beasts on earth, more truely hatefull be; Since all the villanies that can be thought Throughout the world, and altogether brought, To make one Villaine; can make nothing more, Then he that is a Coward, was before. And he that is so, can be nothing lesse, Then the perfection of all wickednesse. In him no manly Vertues dwelling are, Nor any shewes thereof, except for feare. In no brave resolution is he strong, Nor dares he bide in any goodnesse long: For, if one threatning from his foe there come, His vowed Resolution starts he from. And cares not what destruction others have, So he may gaine but hope himselfe to save. The man that hath a fearefull heart, is sure Of that disease that never finds a cure. For take and arme him through in every place, Build round about him twenty walls of Brasse; Girt him with Trenches, whose deepe bottoms lye Thrice lower, then three times the Alpes are hye. Provide (those Trenches, and those walls to ward) A Million of old Souldiers for his guard, All honest men and sworne: His Feaver will Breake in (despight of all) and shake him still. To scape this feare, his Guard he would betray, Make cruelly his dearest friend away; Act any base, or any wicked thing, Be Traytour to his Country, or his King, Forsweare his God, and in some fright goe nig To hang himselfe, to scape the feare to dye. And for these reasons, J shall never care, To reckon them for friends, that Cowards are. I care not for large Fortunes: For I find, Great wants best try the Greatnesse of the minde, And though I must confesse, such Times there be, In which the common wish, hath place in me. Yet, when I search my heart, and what content My God vouchsaf'd me hath; I count my Rent To be above a thousand pound a yeare, More then it can unto the world appeare. And with more wealth, I lesse content might find, If I with riches, had some rich mans mind. A dainty Palate would consume in cheare, (More then I doe) an hundred pounds a yeere, And leave me worse sufficed then I am. Had I an inclination, much to game; A thousand Markes would annually away, And yet I want my full content at Play. If I in Hawks or Dogs had much delight, Twelve hundred Crownes it yeerely waste me might; And yet, not halfe that pleasure bring me to, Which from one Line of This, receive I do. If I to brave Apparell were inclin'd, Five Students Pensions, I should yeerely spend, Yet not be pleas'd so well, with what I weare, As now I am; Nor take so little care. I much for Physick might be forc't to give, And yet a thousand fold, lesse healthy live. To keep my right, the Law my goods might wast, And with vexation tyre me out at last. These, and (no doubt) with these full many a thing To make me lesse content, more wealth might bring, Yet more employ me to, for few I see Who owners of the greatest Fortunes be: But they have still, as they more riches gaine, More State, more lusts, more troubles to maintaine With their Revenues. That the whole account, Of their great seeming Blisse, doth scarce amount To halfe of my content. And can I lesse Esteem this rare acquired happinesse, Then I, a thousand pound in Rent would prize: Since with lesse trouble, it doth more suffice? No, for as when the March is swift and long, And men have foes to meet, both fierce and strong, That Souldier in the Conflict best doth fare, Who getteth Armes of proofe, that lightest are: So I, who with a little, doe enjoy As much my pleasure and content, as they, Whom farre more wealth and businesse doth molest; Account my Fortune and Estate the best. Gods favour in it, I extoll the more: And great possessions much lesse care I for. I care not so I still my selfe may be, What others are, or who takes place of me. I care not for the times unjust neglect; Nor feare their frowns, nor praise their vain respect. For, to my selfe my worth doth never seeme; Or more, or lesse, for other mens esteeme. The Turke, the Devill, Antichrist, and all The Rabble of that Body mysticall, J care not for; and I should sorry be, If I should give them cause to care for me. What Christians ought not to be carefull for, What the Eternall Essence doth abhor, I hate as I am able; and for ought Which God approves not, when I spend a thought. I truly wish that from mine eyes might raine, A shower of Teares, to buy it backe againe. I care not for their Kin, who blush to see, Those of their bloud, who are in meane degree. For, that bewrayes unworthinesse; and showes, How they by chance, and not by vertue rose. To say, My Lord, my Cousin, can to me (In my opinion) no such honour be; (If he from vertues precepts goe astray) As when (my honest Kinsman) I can say, And they are fooles, who, when they raised are; Faine their beginnings, nobler then they were. Yea, they doe rob themselves of truest Fame, With some false honor to belye their Name. For, such as to the highest Titles rise, From pore beginnings, nobler then they were. To honour and observe them (farre) then all That doe succeed them, ever boast of, shall, For, being nothing more then they were borne, Men heed them not (unlesse they merit scorne) For some unworthinesse. And then, perchance, As their forefathers meannesse, did advance His praise the higher, so their Greatnesse shall, Make greater both their infamy and fall. It is mens glory therefore, not a blot, When they the start of all their Names have got; And it is worthlesse Envy, first begun, That false opinion, which so farre hath run. Which well they know, whose Vertues honour win, And shame not to confesse their poorest Kin, For, whensoever they doe looke on those, To God they praises give, and thus suppose: Loe; when the hand of heaven, advanced us, Above our brethren, to be lifted thus; He let them stay behind, for markes to show, From whence we came, and whither we may goe. To have the mind of those, I doe not care, Who both so shamelesse, and so foolish are, That to acquire some poore esteeme, where they Were neuer heard of, untill yesterday, (And never shall perhaps, be thought on more) Can Prodigally there, consume their store: And stand upon their points of honour so, As if their credit had an overthrow, Without redemption: If in ought they misse, Wherein the accomplish't Gallant punctuall is. Yet basely, ev'ry qualitie despise, In which true Wisedome, and true honour lies. If you, and one of those, should dine to day, Twere three to one, but he for all would pay: If but your servant light him to the doore, He will reward him: if but he, and's whore, Carocht a Furlong are; the Coach-man may, For sennight after, let his Horses play, And yet, this fellow, whom abroad you shall Perceive so noble, and so liberall, (To gaine a dayes, perhaps, but one houres Fame) Mong those that hardly, will inquire his name. At home (where every good, and every ill, Remaines to honour, or to shame him still) Neglects Humanitie. Yea, where he lives, And needs most love; all cause of hatred giver, To poole, to racke, to ruine, and oppresse The poore, the widdow, and the fatherlesse, To shift, to lie, to cousen, and delay, The Lab'rer and the Creditor of pay, Are there his practises. And yet this Asse, Would for a man of worth, and honour passe, The Devill he shall assoone: and I will write, The Storie of his being Convertite. I care not for the worlds vaine blast of Fame, Nor doe I greatly feare the Trumpe of shame: For whatsoever good, or ill is done, The rumor of it in a weeke is gone. One thing puts out another; and men sorrow, To day, perhaps, for what they joy to morrow. And it is likely, that ere night they may Condemne the man, they pleased yesterday? Hang him next morning, and be sorry then, Because he cannot be alive agen. But, grant the fame of things had larger date; Alas! what glory is it if men prate In some three Parishes of what we doe, When three great Kingdomes are but Mole-hils to The earths Circumference? and scarce one man Of twenty Millions, know our actions can? Beleeve me, it is worth so little thought, (If the offence to others were not ought) What mens opinions or their speeches be, That were (there not a better cause in me, Which moov'd to Vertue) I would never care, Whether my actions good or evill were. Though still unheeded of the World, I spend My Time and Studies to the noblest end; One hayre, I care not. For, I find reward Beyond the worlds requitall, or regard. And since all men, some things erronious doe, And must in Iustice, somewhat suffer to, In part of my correction This, I take; And that I favour'd am, account doe make. I care not, though there ev'ry houre, should be Some outward discontent to busie me. And, as I would not too much triall have; So, too much carnall peace I doe not crave. The one, might give my Faith a dangerous blow, The other would pervert my life, I know. For, few love Vertue in adversitie; But fewer hold it in Prosperitie. Vaine Hopes (when I had nought, but hopes alone) Have made me erre: Then whither had I gone, (If I, the full possessions had attaind) When, but meere Hopes, my heart to folly traind? Smooth Waies would make me wanton; and my course Must lye, where Labour, Industry, and Force, Must worke me Passage: or, I shall not keepe My Soule from dull securities dead sleepe: But, outward discontentments make me flie Farre higher, then the worlds Contents doe lie. I neither for their pompe, or glory care, Who by the love of vice advanced are. Faire Uertue is the lovely Nymph I serve; Her will I follow, her Commands observe; Yea, though the purblinde world perceive not where, The best of all her Favours I doe weare. And, when great Vices, with faire baited hookes, Large promises of favour tempting lookes, And twenty wiles, hath woo'd me to betray, That noble Mistresse; I have turn'd away: And flung defiance both at Them and Theirs, In spight of all their gaudy Servitors. In which brave daring, I opposde have bin By mighty Tyrants; and was plunged in More wants, then thrice my fortunes would have born, When our Heroes did, or feare, or scorne, To lend me succour (yea in that weake age, When I but newly entred on the Stage Of this proud world) So that, unlesse the King Had nobly pleas'd, to heare the Muses sing, My bold Apologie; till now might I Have struggling bin, beneath their Tyranny. But all those threatning Comets I have seene Blaze, till their glories quite extinct have been. And I, that crusht and lost was thought to be, Live yet, to pitty those that spighted me: Enjoying Hopes which so well grounded are, That, what may follow, I nor feare, nor care. Yet those I know there be, who doe expect, What length my Hopes shall have, and what effect: What envious eyes awayting every day, When all my confidence shall slip away. And make me glad, through those base paths to fly, Which they have trod, to raise their Fortunes by. They flout to heare, that I doe Conscience make, What Place I sue for, or what Course I take. They laugh to see me spend my youthfull time, In serious Studies; and to teach my Rime The Straines of Vertue; whil'st I might perchance, By Lines of Ribaldry, my selfe advance To place of favour. They make scoffes, to heare The praise of Honesty; as if it were For none but vulgar minds. And since they live In brave prosperity, they doe believe It shall continue: and account of Me, As one scarce worthy of their scorne to be. All this is Truth; yea, trust me, care I not; Nor love I Vertue, ought the worse a lot. For, I oft said, that I should live, to see My Way, faire safer then their Courses be. And I have seene, nor one, nor two, nor ten, But (in few yeares) great numbers of those men, From goodly bravery, to rags decline, And waite upon as poore a Fate as mine. Yea those, whom but a day or two before, Were (in their owne vaine hopes) a great deale more Then any of our Auncient Baronage: (And such as many Wisemen of this age, Have wisht to be the men) ev'n those, have I Seene hurled downe to shame, and beggery, In one twelve houres: and grow so miserable, That they become the scornefull, hatefull fable Of all the Kingdome. And there's none so base, But thought himselfe a man in better case. This, makes me pleased with mine owne estate, And fearefull to desire anothers Fate. This makes me Carelesse of the worlds proud scorne, And of those glories, whereto such are borne. And, if to have me, still kept meane and poore, To Gods great glory, shall ought adde the more: Or if to have disgraces heapt on me; (For others, in their way to Blisse) may be Of more Advantage, then to see me thrive In outward Fortunes, or more prized live: J care not though I never see that day, Which with one pins-worth more enrich me may. Yea, by the eternall Dietie I vow; Who knowes I lye not, who doth heare me now. Whose dreadfull Majestie is all I feare, Of whose great Spirit, These the sparklings are, And who will make me, such proud daring, rue; If this my protestation be untrue. So I may still retaine that in Peace, That love and taste of the eternall Blisse; Those matchlesse comforts, and those brave desires, Those sweet Contentments, and immotrall Fires, Which at this instant doe inflame my brest; (And are too excellent to be exprest) J doe not care a Rush, though I were borne Vnto the greatest poverty and scorne: That (since God first infus'de it; with his breath) Poore flesh and bloud, did ever groane beneath. Excepting onely, such a load it were, As no Humanitie was made to beare. Yea, let me keep these thoughts; and let be hurld, Vpon my backe, the spight of all the world, Let me have neither drinke nor bread to eate, Nor Cloathes to weare, but those for which I sweat. Let me become unto my foes a slave; Or, causelesse here the markes of iustice have; For some great villany, that I nere thought, Let my best actions, be against me brought. That small repute, and that poore little Fame Which I have got; let men unto my shame Hereafter turne. Let me become the fable, A talke of fooles. Let me be miserable In all mens eyes, and yet let no man spare, (Though that would make me happy) halfe a reare. Nay (which is more unsufferable farre, Then all the miseries yet spoken are) Let that deare Friend, whose love is more to me, Then all those drops of Crymson liquor be, That warme my heart (and for whose onely good: I could the brunt of all this Care have stood) Let him forsake me. Let that prized Friend, Be cruell too; and when distrest, I send To seeke his Comfort, let him look on me With bitter scorne, and so hard-hearted be; As that (although he know me innocent, And how those miseries I under-went, In love to him) He, yet deny me should, One gentle looke, though that suffice me could. And (truly grieu'd, to make me) bring in place, My well knowne Foe, to scorne me to my face, Let this befall me, and with this, beside, Let me, be for the faulty friend belide. Let my Religion, and my honestie, Be counted till my death Hypocrisie. And when I die, let till the genrall Doome, My Name, each houre into question come, For Sinnes I never did. And if to this, You ought can adde, which yet more grievous is, Let that befall me too; So that, in Me, Those comforts may increase, that springing be, To helpe me beare it. Let that Grace descend, Of which I now, some portion apprehend: And then, as I already (heretofore) (Vpon my Makers strength, relying) swore, So, now I sweare againe; if ought it could, Gods glory further, that I suffer should: Those Miseries recited; I nor care, How soone they ceaz'd me, nor how long they were For, He can make them Pleasures, and I know, As long as he inflicts them, will doe so. Nor unto this assurance am I come, By any Apothegmes gathered from Our old, and much admir'd Philosophers. My Sayings are mine owne, as well as theirs; For, whatsoe're account of them is made, I have as good experience of them had: Yea, when I die (though now they sleighted be) The Times to come, for them, shall honour me, And praise that Minde of mine, which now perchance, Shall be reputed foolish Arrogance. Oh! that my Lines were able to expresse The Cause and Ground, of this my Carelesnesse. That I might shew you, what brave things they be, Which at this instant are a fire in me. Fooles may deride me, and suppose, that This (No more) but some vaine-glorious Humour is; Or such like idle Motion, as may rise From furious and distempered Phantasies. But, let their thoughts be free; I know the Flame That is within me, and from whence it came; Such things have fild me, that I feele my braine Wax giddy, those high Raptures to containe. They raise my Spirits, which now whirling be, As if they meant to take their leave of me. And could these Straines of Contemplation, stay To lift me higher still, but halfe a day: By that Time, they would mount to such a height, That all my Cares would have an end to Night. But oh! I feele the fumes of flesh and bloud, To clog those Spirits in me, and like mud, They sinke againe. More dimly burne my fires, To Her low pitch, my Muse againe retires: And as her Heavenly flames extinguisht be, The more I finde my Cares to burthen me. Yet, I beleeve, I was enlightned so, That never shall my Spirit stoope so low, To let the servile thoughts, and dunghill cares, Of common Minds, entrap me in their snares. For, still I value not, those things of nought, For which the greatest part, take greatest thought. Much for the world J care not, and (confesse) Desire I doe, my care for it were lesse. I doe not care, (for ought they me could harme) If with more mischiefes, this last age did swarme; Yea such poore Joy I have, or Care to see The best Contents these times can promise Me. And that small feare of any Plague at all, (Or Miseries) which on this Age may fall. That, but for Charitie, I did not care If all those comming stormes, which some doe feare, Were now descending downe. For Hell can make No uproare, which my peacefull thoughts may shake. I founded have my hopes on Him that hath A shelter for me, in the day of wrath. And I have trust, I shall (without amaze,) Looke up, when all burnes round me in a blaze. And if to have these Thoughts, &amp; this Mind known, Shall spread Gods praise no further then mine owne: Or, if This shall no more instructive be, To others; then it glory is to Me: Here let it perish, and be hurled by, Into oblivion everlastingly, For, with this Mind, I can be pleas'd, (as much) Though none but I my selfe did know it such. And, he that hath contentment, needs not care; What other mens opinions of it, are I care not though for many griefes to come, To live an hundred yeeres, it were my Doome. Nor care I though I summon'd be, away, At Night, to Morrow-morning, or to Day. I care not whether This, you read or no, Nor whether you beleeve it, if you doe. I care not whether any Man suppose All This from Iudgement, or from Rashnes flowes. Nor meane I, to take Care what any man, Will thinke thereof; Or Comment on it can. I care not who shall fondly censure it; Because it was not with more Method writ: Or fram'd in imitation, of the Straine, In some deepe Grecian or old Romane vaine. Yea, though that all men living should despise, These Thoughts in Me, to heed, or Patronize: I vow, I care not. And I vow, no lesse, I care not who dislikes this Carelesnesse. My Minde's my Kingdome; and I will permit No others Will, to have the rule of it. For, I am free; and no mans power (I know) Did make me thus, nor shall unmake me now. But, through a Spirit none can quench in me: This Mind I got, and this, my Mind shall be. To Envy. Now looke upon Me Envy, if thou dare, Dart all thy Malice shoot mee ev'ry where: Try all thy waies thou canst, to make me feele The cruell sharpnesse of thy poys'ned steele. For, I am Envy-proofe, and scorne I doe, The worst thy cankered spight can urge thee to. This Word, I care not, is so strong a Charme, That He, who speakes it truely feares no harme, Which thy accursed Rancor, harbor may; Or, his perversest Fortunes, on him lay. Goe, hatefull Fury; Hagge, goe, hide thou then, Thy snakie head, in thy abhorred Den. And since thou canst not have thy will of Me: There, Damned Fiend, thine own tormentres be, Thy forked slings upon thy body turne; With Hellish flames, thy scorched entrailes burne; From thy leane Carkasse, thy blacke fine was teare, With thine owne Venome burst, and perish there. Nec Habeo, nec Careo, nec Curo. A Postscript. Qvite through this Iland hath my Motto rung, And twenty dayes are past, since up I hung My bold Impreza: which defiance throwes At all the malice of faire Vertues foes. The good approve it; and so crowne the Cause Of this my Resolution, with applause: That such as spight it, dare not to appeare, In opposition to the Challenger. Their Malice would enforce them; but, it lyes Oppressed yet, with fearefull Cowardize; For, they so arm'd have found me, that they feare, I may (in spight of all their Enuy) beare The Conquest from them: and upon the Face Of their be-spotted Fame, stick more disgrace. This, makes them Storme in private, Slander, Raile, Threat, Libell, Rime, Detract; and to prevaile Vpon my Patience, try their utmost Art, But, I still mind my Mottoes latter part, And Care not for it which more makes them chafe, And still the more they fret, the more I laugh. But, now their Envies have so well conspir'd, That they have fram'd the Proiect they desir'd; And tooke such course, that (if their word you take) Shall move my Choller, and my Patience shake. Forsooth, some Rimers they have hyr'd, to chew Their Rancor into Balladry, and spew Their blacke Despight, which to a drunken note, They, in a hundred Tavernes, have by roate Already belcht unto that Auditory, Who are the fittest Trumpets of their Story. When their Inventions (by the power Divine Of much-inspiring Sacke and Claret wine) Are ripened to the highest; then they say The Stationer expects it ev'ry day: And that he may a saving bargaine make, (Aforehand) doth his Customers bespeake. But when these Braine wormes crawling forth you spy, (As pitty 'twere, such wit should smother'd lie) They will bewray the Sires; and mak't appeare, That Ignorance and Envy Parents were Yo that despightfull Issue: So, that he Who shall a Rush the lesse, esteeme of Me, For ought there Writ: ev'n (He) is one of Them, Whose Hate, and whose Affection I contemne. The Instruments they get to serve the turne, Are those, that are unworthy of my Scorne: And if contend, or answer them I should; It more might wrong me, then their Riming could, As therefore, when an armed Souldier feeles A testy Curre in vaine to gnaw his heeles; He minds not Him: but spends his blowes upon Those churlish Peasants, that did set him on. So; I, that know these Dogges doe but their kind; Well; let them barke, and snarle, and spend their wind, Till they grow weary. But let them sit strong, That urge them to it; or I'le lay along Their high Top gallant, where each Groome shall see How worthy scorne and infamy they be. For, they who are their Patrons are such Foes, As I may somewhat worthily oppose: And I'le unmaske them so, that you shall spie In them, Detractions true Anatomy. Yea, whereas they have by their malice, thought To have on me their spightfull pleasures wrought; I'le from their Censures, an occasion take, To show how other men a sport shall make At all Detractions; So, those slaves undoe, Who that base practise are inclin'd unto. Raile they that list: for those men know not yet, What mind I have; who thinke the man that writ This Motto, can be ever brought to feare Such poore fond things, as idle Carpers are; Nay rather, from those slanders they shall raise, I will advantage gather for my praise: While they that in my shame would take delight, Shall gnaw their flesh through vengeance and despight To see how I, unmov'd their envy mocke, And make of them this Ages laughing-stocke. For, lest to have prevailed they should seeme; And so grow wise men in their owne esteeme: (Or, by their foolish brags, dishearten such, Whose resolutions are not growne so much) When I at leisure am; for Recreation, I'le merry make my selfe, to their vexation; Yet shall my Mirth from Malice be so free, That though I bitter to the guilty be. It shall appeare that I in love doe scourge them, That of their foule Corruptions I may purge them. And that it may be knowne how Vertue hath A sting to punish, though not moov'd to wrath. But goe; and for the Pamphlet seeke about, For, yet ere night ('tis thought) it will come out. Yet, when you finde it; Doe not looke for there His wit alone, whose Name you see it beare: (For though you nothing can collect from thence, But foul-mouth'd Language, Rime and Impudence) Yet there expect, (since 'tis the common cause Of all Crowe-Poets, and Poeticke-Dawes, Which I have toucht) that all the Brotherhood, Will lend theit wits to make the Quarrell good. For, to that purpose they are all combind; Yea, to their strong Confed'racy are ioynd, That Corporation, by whose Patronage, Such Poetry hath flourisht in this Age: And some beside, that dare not yet be knowne, Haue favour, to this goodly Project showne. But, let them joyne their force; For I had rather Ten Millions should themselves against Me gather; (And plot and practise for my overthrow) Then be the Conqueror of one base Foe. For, as mine enemies increasing be; So, Resolution doth increase in mee: And if I must have foes, my Fates shall friend me, If great and noble enemies they send me. But, whether on meane Foes, or great I light, My Spirit will be greater then their spight. An Epigram, written by the Author on his owne Picture; where this Motto was inscribed. Thus others Loves, have set my shadow forth, To fill a Roome, with Names of greater worth: And Me, among the rest, they set to show, Yet, what I am, I pray mistake not, tho. Imagine me, nor EÃ¡rle, nor Lord, nor Knight, Nor any new advanced Favourite. For, you would sweare, if This well pictur'd me, That such a One I ne'r were like to be. No child of purblind Fortun's was I borne, For all that issue holdeth Me in scorne. Yet, He that made Me, hath assur'd Me to, Fortune can make no such; not such undo. And bids me, in no Favours take delight; But what I shall acquire, in Her despight. Which Mind, in Raggs, I rather with to beare, Then rise through basenes, bravest Robes to weare: Part of my Outside hath the Picture showne; Part of my Inside, by these Lines is knowne: And 'tis no matter of a rush to me, How This or That, shall now esteemed be.
