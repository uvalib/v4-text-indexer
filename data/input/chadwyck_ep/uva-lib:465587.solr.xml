      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable Mr. LAW, Jun. Mr. Brown's Prophecies. A Prophecy found under the Foundation of the Chappel of Wallingford House, engraved on Lead, and discover'd on Saturday the 2d of June, 1694, and sent by T. Povey, Esq; to the Lord Mayor, who Proclaim'd a Fast thereon. When Tewksbury Mustard shall wander abroad, And die in a Land without Magpye or Toad, Then the Sawce of the Veal, joining three to one Lyon, Shall devour a Fish, the Pad-nag of Arion: The Lillies shall try to swim over the Ferry, Where they shall be met with, and drowned by Cherry. The Children of France, with Famine opprest, Shall weep that their Mother has never a Breast. A PROPHECY Found under the Trees and Bench in St. James's Park the 12th of June, 1694. engrav'd in Copper, and carry'd to my Lord Chamberlain, by Serjeant Barecroft. When the last of all Knights is the first of all Knaves; And the best of all Pimps is the worst of all Braves; When a Coward is dubb'd for not Fighting, but Feeding, And a Lubberly Brute preferr'd for his Breeding: When a Medal and Chain is bestow'd on a Hog, Who deserves more a Rope, than ever did Dog, When Prophecies are coin'd by a Drunken Buffoon, Whose chief Talent lies in abusive Lampoon; When the Black-Rod is given to a bold brazen Face, What Beast may not hope at Whitehall for a Place? A PROPHECY Found on Friday the 29th of January, 1696. by some Workmen digging up the Ruins of the Privy-Garden, and by them carry'd to the Usher of the Black-Rod, as it was written in a Scroll of Parchment. When a Knight of the North is lopp'd in Ax-Yard, By a biting P???'s Trick having plaid a false Card; When at the Green-Cloth a Grey Fox do's preside, And a Wolf in a Chain thro' the City does ride; When Chalk pays for Cheese, and Gold dwindles to Wood, And Banks rather let in than keep out the Flood, When Grocers-Hall fears to be sent to the Compter, Publick Faith being so light that a Feather will mount her: When the Coin scarcer grows, tho' the Mints do increase, And we are maul'd with a War, without hopes of a Peace. When the Ocean's so Frenchify'd, few Ships dare ride in't, And is rul'd by a Shovel instead of a Trident; When Justice is forc'd to abandon the Land, Tho' most People are seen with her Scales in their Hand: When a Pack of brib'd Knaves do a Chappel disgrace, That deserve the same Fate with the Saints in the Place: When London's great Wisdom is seen in a Cuddon, And a Man with a Nose do's Things that he shoud'n: Then England, I tell thee, thou't cursedly Shamm'd, 'Tis too late to repent, so sin on and be damn'd. A PROPHECY Found in a Vault in Lambeth Chappel. When the Number that stands next to that of the Muses, And the Member to Man that of visible use is: When the Thing that still wishes his Dad at Old-Nick, But together aspires to an Arch-bishoprick: When the Panther, so spotless, is plagu'd with a Head, Whose Outside is Brass, and whose Inside is Lead: When Lambeth its Primitive Oracle lost; Instead of a Pillar, is propt with a Post: And Britain beholds, in an eminent Station, An immod'rate Dunce of great Moderation; If such a dull Guide to the Church proves a Benison, You may Swear Contradictions are true, and that Ten-is-one. ON A Silver Piss-Pot, Occasion'd by a Bill to compel the bringing in of Plate to be Coin'd, 1696–7. Maids need no more their Silver Piss-pots scour, For they must jog, like Traytors, to the Tower. Presumptuous Pisspot, how durst thou offend? Compelling Females on their Knees to bend. To Kings and Queens we humbly bow the Knee, But Queens themselves are forc'd to stoop to Thee. To thee they cringe, and with a straining Face They ease their Grief by opening of their Case; In Times of need, thy Help they do implore, And oft to ease their Ailments make thee roar; What Woman, tho' of strictest Modesty, But her dear Secret wou'd impart to Thee? Long hast thou been a Pris'ner and confin'd, But Liberty is now for thee design'd: Thee whom so many Beauties have enjoy'd, Now in a better State shalt be imploy'd. And with Delight be handled every Day, And oft'ner occupy'd another way: So shalt thou pass as Currant and as free As that which has so often into thee. Melesinda's Misfortune on the Burning of her Smock, 1690. Tir'd with the Bus'ness of the Day, Upon her Couch supinely lay; Fair Melesinda void of Care, No living Creature being near: When strait a calm and gentle Sleep Did o'er her drowsy Eye-lids creep: Her Senses thus by Fetters ty'd, By nimble Fancy were supply'd: Her quick Imagination brought Th' Ideas of her waking Thought; She dreamt her self a new-made Bride In Bed, by young Philander's Side: The Posset's eat, the Stocking thrown, And all the Company's withdrawn; And now the blest Elisium, Of all her wisht for Joys, is come. Philander, all dissolv'd in Charms, Lyes raptur'd in her circling Arms, With panting Breasts, and swimming Eyes, She meets the visionary Joys; In all the Amorous Postures Love, Which th' Height of Extasy cou'd move: But as she roving did advance Her trembling Legs, O dire Mischance! The Couch being near the Fire-side, Sh' expanded them, alas! too wide: Sh' expos'd her nethermost Attire Unto th' Embraces of the Fire; So the chast Phœnix of the East With flutt'ring fires her spicy Nest. So Semele, embracing Jove, Burnt with Fire and with Love. The Flames at first did trembling seize The dangling Hem of the lost Prize; But finding no Resistance higher, As 'tis their Nature to aspire, Approaching near the Seat of Bliss, The Center of earthly Happiness, Which vastly more of Pleasure yields, Than all the feign'd Elysian Fields: But Ignorance must now excuse The Silence of my bashful Muse: Its Modesty had ne'er the Face T'ascend above the Gartering Place; But doubtless 'twas a lovely Sight The Fire beheld by his own Light. So Ovid wish'd himself a Flea, That so transform'd he might survey His Love all o'er, and uncontroul'd Her very Grace and Charm behold. Had Ovid's Flea been there to Night, I fear 't had had but small Delight, His Rival Flames had spoil'd his Bliss, And made him Curse his Metamorphosis. At last the Flames were grown so rude, They boldly ev'ry where intrude; They soon recall'd the Lady's Sense, And chac'd the pleasing Vision thence: Soon as her Eyes recover'd Light, She strait beheld the dismal Sight; Beheld her self, like Blazing-Star, Or bright tail'd Glow-worm to appear: She had no time to meditate Upon the Strangeness of her Fate; But was confin'd to lay about, To beat the impious Fire out: The am'rous Flames were loth to go, They kiss'd her Hand at ev'ry Glow; And round her Ivory Fingers play, And seem'd as if they begg'd to stay. Vanquish'd at last they did retire, And in a gloomy Smoak expire. Then viewing of her half-burnt Smock, Thus to her self the sad Nymph spoke: Is this the Effect of Dreams? Is this The Fruit of all my fancy'd Bliss? Misfortunes will, I see, betide, When Maidens throw their Leggs too wide: Had I but kept my Legs a-cross, I and my Smock had had no Loss: I ought, I'm sure, t' have took more heed, For ne'er had Virgin greater need; My Kindness and my little Care Has left me scarce a Smock to wear: Some have been beg'd, some have been burn'd, All are to Clouts, or Tinder, turn'd. Two Smocks last Night the Flames surpriz'd, And in the Flasket sacrific'd; Others I did on Friends bestow, Not dreaming I shou'd want 'em now; But I cou'd bear the Loss of them, Had not the Fire disturb'd my Dream. There is a Saying frights me too, But Heav'n forbid it shou'd be true; That where a Virgin burns her Train, So, all her Life-time, she'd remain. I dare not be of this Belief, For shou'd I, I should die with Grief, Live always here a Nun-like Life And never, never be a Wife; Never enjoy a Marriage-Bed, Nor lose a hated Maidenhead: Ah! Cruel Flames, you're too unkind To bring these Fancies to my Mind: Down, down into your native Cell, In your own Blazing Regions dwell: Vex me no more, let me possess My Linen, or my Dream in Peace. Thus the poor Nymph, bewail'd her treach'rous Luck. At once to lose so good a Dream and Smock. THE Claret Drinker's Song; OR, The Good Fellow's Design, 1684. A pox of this Fooling and Plotting of late, What a Pother and Stir hath it kept in the State? Let the Rabble run mad with Suspicions and Fears, Let 'em scuffle and jar 'till they fall by the Ears: Their Greivances never shall trouble my Pate, So that I can enjoy my dear Bottle in Quiet. What Coxcombs were those that wou'd farther their Ease, And their Necks, for a Toy, a thin Wafer and Mass, At old Tyburn they never had needed to swing, Had they been true Subjects to Drink, and their King. A Friend and a Bottle is all my Design, It has no Room for Treason that's top full of Wine. I mind not the Members, nor Makers of Laws, Let 'em sit and prorogue as his Majesty please: Let 'em damn us to Woollen I'll never repine, At my Lodging when Dead, so alive I have Wine: Yet, oft in my Drink, I can hardly forbear To curse 'em for making my Claret so dear: I mind not great Asses who idly debate About Right and Succession, the Trifles of State; We've a Good King already, and he deserves Laughter That will trouble his Head with who shall come after. Come, here is his Health, and I wish he may be As free from all Cares and Troubles as we. What care I how Leagues with Hollanders go, On Intreigues between Sydney and Monsieur D'avaux? What concerns it my Drink, if Cazal be sold, If the Conquerour takes it by Storming, or Gold? Good Bourdeaux alone is the Place that I mind, And when the Fleet's coming, I pray for the Wind: The Bully of France, that aspires to Renown, By dull cutting of Throats, and ventring his own: Let him fight and be damn'd, make Matches and Treat, To afford News-mongers and Coffee-Houses Chat. He's but a brave Wretch, whilst I am more free, More safe, and a Thousand times happier than he: Come he, or the Pope, or the Devil too boot, Or come Faggot or Stake, I care not a Groat: Never think that in Smithfield I Porters will heat, No, I swear, good Mr. Fox, excuse me for that: I'll Drink in defiance of Gibbet and Halter, This is the Profession that never will alter. Advice to Dr. OATES not to be Melancholly in 1685, when a Prisoner in the King's Bench. As I'm inform'd, on Monday last you sat As dismal as a Melancholly Cat, Folding your Arms, and pulling down your Hat Over your Eyes, and groaning in a Chair, As if you did for God knows what despair: Fye, Doctor, Fye! you know it is a Folly, Thus to submit and yield to Melancholly; For 'twill mutabilate poor Nature's Light, And turn it's Day into a gloomy Night: Alas! what if you have been often stript, And at a Cart's-Arse so severely whipt, That Rivulets of Blood ran dawn your Back, Through Slashes given you by Hangman Jack? And further (which was Punishment enough,) What tho' you sometimes wore a Wooden Ruff? And what if Oates be now laid in a Gaol, ('Stead of a Barn) and thresh'd with that same Flall We call Contempt? Shit, let 'em kiss your Tail. 'Long as (through Providence) you are supported By all the Holy Sisters, and are courted Almost of all your Presbyterian Brothers; What need you care whose Dunghill, Sir, you shit on? Those that take up the Sword for G? must fight on. But if your Sadness does proceed from Fear Of being mounted on a Three-legg'd-Mare, And (in a Line) to Preach a Sermon there; Well may you Melancholly be, and vex, Because the Jade does always break the Necks Of those that ride upon her: Therefore sure Nothing so great a Penance can endure. Or Doctor, if you have an inward Sting, For swearing falsly against Pickering, And many more innocent poor Wretches, Your Heart must needs be grip'd and full of Stitches, And you may well through Fear be shit your Breeches. If you are guilty of those horrid Crimes, Defer not, Doctor, but repent betimes: If your Heart be Flinty hard, and Stony Doubtless you'll be damn'd, and go to Tony: That was the subtle Fox that set you on; He eat the Meat, and made you pick the Bone; He ran away, and left the Goose alone. But who can help it? 'Tis in vain to fret; By vexing you may lose, but nothing get, Therefore be Merry, Sir, as you were won't; Instead of fulsome, use a wholesome— To the Memory of Mr. JOHN OLDHAM. For that is dangerous for a Man to be Too busy with immutable Decree, I cou'd, Dear Friend, e'en blame thy cruel Doom, That lent so much, to be requir'd so soon: The Flowers, in which the Meads are deck'd so gay. Altho' they are short-liv'd, they live a Day; Thou in the Noon of Life wer't snatch'd away. Tho' not before thy Verse had Wonders shown, And bravely made the Age to come thy own. The Company of Beauty, Wealth, and Wine, Were not so charming, not so sweet as thine. They quickly perish, yours was still the same, An everlasting, but a lambent Flame, Which something so resistless did impart It still through ev'ry Ear, won ev'ry Heart. Unlike the Wretch, who strives to get Esteem, Nay, thinks it fine, and jantee to blaspheme, And can be witty on no other Theme, Ah! Foolish Man! (whom thou did'st still despise) That must be wicked to be counted wise: But thy Converse was from this Error free; And yet 'twas every Thing true Wit cou'd be: None had it, but ev'n with a Tear does own The Soul of Dear Society is gone. But while we thus thy Native Sweetness sing, We ought not to forget thy Native Sting; Thy Satyr spar'd no Follies, nor no Crimes, Satyr the best Reformer of the Times! While diff'rent Priests eternally contest, And each will have his own Religion best, And in a Holy Huff damns all the rest. Their Love to Gain, not Godliness, is shown: Heav'ns Work they leave undone, to do their own. How wide shoot they that strive to blast thy Fame, By saying that thy Verse was rough and lame? They wou'd have Satyr their Compassion move, And write so pliant nicely, and so smooth, As if the Muse were in a Flux of Love. But who of Knaves, and Fops and Fools does sing Must Force, and Fire, and Indignation bring, For 'tis no Satyr, if it has no Sting. In short, who in that Field wou'd famous be, Must think, and write like Juvenal and thee: Let others boast of all the mighty Nine, To make their Labours with more Lustre shine, I never had no other Muse but Thee: Ev'n thou wert all the mighty Nine to Me; 'Twas thy Dear Friendship did my Breast inspire, And warm'd it first with a Poetick Fire: But 'tis a warmth that does with thee expire. For when the Sun is set, that guides the Day, The Traveller must stop, or lose his Way. A Satyr on Marriage, Supposed to be spoken by one who was threaten'd to be disinherited, on condition he refus'd the Match that was offer'd him by his Friends. No—let my Friends determine what they will, I'm fixt, and keep my Resolution still, Against the Threaten'd Marriage Bonds declare With Them and all the World eternal War: My Freedom I at its just Value rate, And love my Quiet, more than my Estate: Marriage of each is the destructive Bane, No sooner match'd but we lament in vain Their fatal Loss, which we must e'er sustain. Of all its Days the first and last are best, So vastly is it! so compleatly bless'd! Oh! glorious State! replenish'd with Delight! A Hundred Ills each Day, for one good Night! In Marriage sure, if any Comfort be, 'Tis in the hope that we may once be free, When kinder Death the Union has unty'd, And taken to himself the gracious Bride. Who ever cou'd the tiresom Load sustain, But for the Hope once to be freed again? For why shou'd Man, of a free gen'rous Mind, Be to one Obiect all his Days confin'd? Still ty'd to what He cannot Love so fast, And find no Rest until he finds his last: Ten thousand Tortures in his Soul arise, And while in Spight she lives, each hour He dies. For me I'm too much to my self a Friend, To chuse those Evils which this State attend. I hate a Bargain, when we go to woo Why can't we all things as compleatly do, Without the Curate and the Lawyer too? When once the dire ill-omen'd yes we say, The Joys of Love soon vanish all away, The thing's quite spoil'd, because a Duty grown, And pleases now no more because our own; But what's forbidden fiercely we pursue, And wond'rous Charms are in the thing call'd New. Wou'd you at height maintain the pleasing Flame, Then carefully preserve a Lover's Name, By Forms Love's brisk Affairs are ruin'd quite, And the dull Name of Husband palls Delight: Beside, the tedious Yoak what need we bear. When we may be as unconfin'd as Air? Not forc'd to live in Discontent and Noise, And all those Griefs that wait neglected Joys; But uncontroul'd at Liberty to range, Or when o'er-labour'd find our Ease in Change. Oh! with what art th' industrious Lover tries To hide his Failings from his Celia's Eyes? But when espous'd, 'tis then no longer so, Each other than too soon, too well they know, Then forth each hid Defect with Vigour springs, All Cares to please accounted needless things, Soon all the rare accomplish'd Glories fade, Like a fine Flower in its Bloom decay'd! He that was once so neat! so trim! so gay! Like the delightful Month of smiling May, Wears a perpetual Cloud upon his Brow, And looks as low'ring as December now: You'd think He'd nought but Law-suits in his Head And all his Grace and all his Wit is fled, By Wedlock made a perfect useless Tool, A droning Idiot, and a dreaming Fool! And whoso does an equal Hazard run, Can he expect that very Fate to shun? Or justly think he's thus sufficient grown To be her Master, who is not his own? No! no! He'll find that all his Skill will fail, Altho' he is the Head, to rule her Tail. Of this so serious Bus'ness, if you doubt, Illustrious Cordyon shall make it out: We safely now may quote the glorious Peer, And need no Scandalum Magnatum fear. Cuckold of high Degree!—and that he's so, He's taken Pains that all the World shou'd know Davis's Fate's like his, and Collin's too, Whose Business, tho' more secret, is as true. Shou'd I thro' all the Race of Cuckolds run, To name them all, I never should have done; Or tell since the first Planting of the Horn, What vast Encrease each Age and Soil has born. In Paradice the Serpent, some believe, With something else than Apples tempted Eve; The thing is well suppos'd the Creature's wise, And knows the Worth of Opportunities! But say that this Suspicion is unjust, Yet why shou'd Man to Woman's Frailty trust? No! as a Wiseman ought, I'll be secure, And keep me from the Danger that I may be sure. Oxford Barber's Verses on Queen Mary's Death, 1695. Soon as the dismal News came down, And spread it self about the Town, I in a trice, with heavy Soul, As Snails their Horns, drew in my Pole, Shut Shop, and in a Passion swore, I'd never use my Scissars more: Since Lachesis so rash had been, To cut the Throat of gracious Queen; But I designing more Than ever Barber did before, Resolv'd on the too sad Occasion To exercise a strange Vocation, Rhyme, the great Business of the Nation. I thought it errant Shame to fetter True English Sense in Foreign Metre: For none do bury, I conjecture, Folks in Outlandish Manufacture: Not, but that I my Grief cou'd tell In any other Tongue as well. Whether in Turkish or Arabick, In Ethiopick, or Malabrick, In Cambro-Britanick or Togray, Or Lingua Balaam's Ass did bray; But why shou'd I my Readers vex With these Barbarian Dialects. In short already I have ended, And done what I first intended, 'Tis uncorrected, unamended. No Tutor did this Work peruse, Nor Money hir'd a Hackney Muse, Tho' that's the Fashion of the Town, This I protest is all my own. Upon Love, in Imitation of Cowley. By Mr. Brown. Whether we Mortals love or no, 'Tis the same Case whate'er we do. For Love does killing Pleasure give, And without Love 'tis Death to Live: If then to love, so painful be, And not to love be Misery, What a sad Case must he be in, Who has disgrac'd and jilted been? Banish'd for ever from those Eyes, Which conquer Fools, and fool the Wise, And none but Stoicks can despise? They conquer, but they will not yield, Love knows no such unequal Field: But in Love's gentle Fight Both Conquer, when they both submit. Sometimes the better to perswade, I call in Heraldry to my Aid: I'speak my Sire's and Grandsire's Praise, Tell her how Brave, how Good he was: Theu magnify my self, and say, How Wise, how Witty, and how Gay I am, and (as the times go now) How constant, and how sober too: But she, instead of this, demands What Stock, what Money, Sir? what Lands? Shepherds and Clowns inherit Life, Do you e'er think to get a Wife? Because your Dad was born before ye, That, Sir, is but an idle Story. Tho' Men be witty, wise or gay, Fools may love as well as they: Wit will not please at Night, nor profit in the Day. Curse on the Money, wou'd he were Sunk beyond Hell to languish there, Condemn'd to everlasting Chains, Where the rich Miser Pluto reigns. Who first call'd Counters Happiness, What an improper thing is this? That Money is th' common Cause of Strife, The Common Barrater of Life, Sets Brethern into mortal Fray, Makes Children Parents disobey, Makes Wars and Slaughters to abound, Where Peace, and Joy, before were found; And which is worst of all, it does Loves gentle Votaries abuse, It does to Love it's pow'rful Aids deny, Whilst, for want of it, the Lovers dye. The Female Casuist; or, Sherlock's Conversion, 1690. Passive-Obedience and Non- Resistance out of Doors are gone; Sherlock himself, that Man of Sense, Has sworn, some say, to save his Pence: Others will have it that he swore, 'Cause grown ridiculously poor; And that, like Job, upon an Hill Of Dung he sat, lamenting, while His wiser Wife reproaching said, He for himself no Reason had; For why (quoth she) great Tillotson, Stillingfleet, Patrick, Tenison, Horneck, Henchman, and the whole Gown, Preach up for swearing thro' the Town: Nay, Oxford Jane, to keep his Place, We hear has turn'd his other Face; And also Beveridge the brave, And who can think these play the Knave? Since whilom they, and some few more Baffled Scotch Burnet o'er and o'er; Forcing our Synod to comply, And own three Creeds and Trinity. In Cambridge too, the famous Gower Hinder'd others, himself yet swore: So lately Salamanca Oates, By gentle swearing, sav'd our Throats: Besides (quoth she) our Dukes place El? And hundreds more too long to tell. In learned wise, quoth Hudibras, As Casuist in such a Case; He that swears against his Will, Is of the same Opinion still: Therefore, Dear, prithee ne'er more look On thy Passive-Obedience Book; But mark what others do before you, And what great Ones will then adore you: There's the long Robe, whose subtle Pate First taught us how to abdicate; Then Mob, Car, Par, Will, and Mall, And of Black-Coats the Devil and all: Thus you see 'tis more than plain, They that swear not are Rogues in grain. The Practical Quaker; or, the New Lights. ? Velut inter ignes Luna minores. Hor. In Doggrel Rhymes we seldom use To stay for any Gods, or Muse; But in so nice a Case as this, I think it cannot do amiss: For all the Link-Boys round the Town Have sworn (I hear) to run them down; The Men of Tallow, Wick, and Cotton, The Tinmen too the Cry have gotten, Whom, let me see, shall we retain? Phœbus for once shall be the Man. Great God of Lights! we thee invoke, If not on t'other Side bespoke; The Stars above, to us below, Just like your Farthing-Candles show; Whilst thou, with glorious Lustre crown'd, Dost hang like one of Six in the Pound; Thou, who'rt all Eve, cast half an one Down on this new Invention. 'Tis knew indeed to Men below, But known in Heav'n long ago; The Stars, in such just Chrystal Spheres, Have burnt above five thousand Years: They fear no Storm by Day, or Night, But thus hang Wind or Weather tight; And so they'll hang till Day of Doom, By that time they'll their Oil consume; And then their Glasses breaking round us, In Flames they'll fall, and so confound us; Nay, we can prove the Milky-Way, (For all Sir Sydrophel can say) Is but a Street of some such Lights, To guide the heav'nly Folks arights; The Council-Chamber, up above, Is hung with such, and Jove's Alcove; Tin, Horn, and Grease they've none, and I dare swear, There's ne'er a Tallow-Chandler there. Prometheus once (that Son of Fame) Upon a Visit hither came; And lik'd the Thing so wond'rous well, He strait upon the Tryal fell: But whether (as some Authors say) The Tallow-Chandlers shew'd foul Play, Or Link-Boys us'd to break his Glasses, (For variously the Story passes;) The Project fail'd, and he ran mad, But Luck the Virtuoso had, That's all the Bird (the Poets say) Lies gnawing of him Night and Day. May more propitious Fates attend Our present Art-improving Friend; Were this Invention understood, 'Twou'd be of universal Good: The Stars might go to sleep a-nights, And leave their Work to these new Lights; The Midwife Moon might mind her Calling, And noisy Lightman leave his Bawling: Men might pull in their Horns, and be From Officers and Summons free; 'Tis these Moon-Cursers that maintain The Cry, by Darkness still to gain; Whose chief Employ, Tom T???d?man right, In Winter Weather, lies by Night: Nay, with such potent Influence, Their streaming Rays they do dispense, That if the Sun shou'd lie too long Here, he might have his Business done; He might indulge in Thetis' Lap, And, while they burn, take t'other Nap. Oh! had you been the other Night In Cheapside, at th' amazing Light, Where with their sawcer Eyes they hung. And gather'd the admiring Throng; The plying Punks crept into Holes, Who walk'd the Streets before by Shoals: The Night cou'd now no longer skreen The Tavern-Sots from being seen; The Light-men they began to rally, Who blush'd, and turn'd down Grocers-Alley. The Tempest you have seen, no doubt, Just so the Candles all went out: Those silly Tools no more cou'd burn Than Kitchen-Grease before the Sun. The Quaker, with up-lifted Hands, By Yea and Nay, the Rogue commends: Of all their boasted Light, he said, These never entred once our Head. When we compare our Times with those are past, We cry, this Age of greater Light can boast; I'll say so too, if this Device hit right, Else swear our Age wants Wit as well as Light. An Epitaph on Algernon Sidney, 1683. Algernon Sidney fills this Tomb, An Atheist, by disclaiming Rome; A Rebel bold, for striving still To keep the Laws above the Will, And hind'ring those wou'd tread 'em down, To leave no Limits to a Crown: Crimes, damn'd by Church and Government, But, Oh! where must his Soul be sent? Of Heav'n it ever must despair, If that the Pope be Turn-Key there: And Hell it ne'er can entertain, For there is all tyrannick Reign; And Purgatory's such Pretence, It ne'er receiv'd a Man of Sense: Where goes it then? Why, where it ought to go, Where neither Pope, nor Devil, have to do. An Epitaph on TRUE, Queen MARY's DOG. If Wit, or Honesty, could save Our mould'ring Ashes from the Grave; This Stone had yet remain'd unmark'd, I still writ Prose, and True still bark'd: But envious Fate has claim'd its Due, Here lies the mortal part of True: His deathless Virtues must survive, To better us that are alive. His Prudence, and his Wit, were seen In that, from Mary's Grace and Mien, He own'd the Pow'r, and lov'd the Queen: By long Obedience he confess'd, That serving her was to be bless'd: Ye Murmurers, let True evince That Men are Beasts, and Dogs have Sense. His Faith and Truth all Whitehall knows, He ne'er could fawn, or flatter those Whom he believ'd were Mary's Foes: Ne'er sculk'd from whence his Sovereign led him, Nor snarl'd against the Hand that fed him: Read this, you Statesmen now in Favour, And mend your own, by True's Behaviour. An Epitaph on a Stumbling-Horse. Here lies the Horse beneath this Stone, Who living, oft has lain on one: A noble Steed, who, as he went, Proclaim'd still his high Descent: A proudly headed Nag he was, And hence it often came to pass; Tho' he his Feet nought valued, He still stood much upon his Head. He was no War-Horse, yet he knew The Art to squat and lie perdu; Yea, many a Horse, long-train'd in Wars, Had never half so many Scars: There's only this small Diff'rence in't, Theirs were Steel Wounds, but his of Flint. He was no Hunter, nor did care To follow Chace of Fox or Hare; Yet had this Property of Hound, He still was smelling on the Ground. And tho' Dame Nature did not frame Him for a Finder of the Game; Yet were it lost, none certainly Wou'd sooner stumble on't than he. He was no Racer, as some say, Tho' some conclude the other way; And say, for Swiftness, he might run Against the Horses of the Sun: For tho' full swift Don Phœbus be, This wou'd be sooner down than he: For his Opinion Critick-Wit, Does vary much in guessing it: Some say he was Conformist bred, He bow'd so low; but some this Steed Think may for Nonconformist go, At every thing he stumbles so. Some think him Presbyter, 'cause he Brings Rider down to Purity. But some say no, for, by this knock, He still throws Jocky from his Back. Some for Rebaptist him bespatter, For dipping Rider oft in Water; But all no Quaker him conclude, Because with Knee Respect he shew'd: Some think him Papist, 'cause so prone He was to worshipping of Stone: Some think again, that Tripping he Confutes Infallibility. But most allow him (which is worse) No more Religion than a Horse: Well, now he's dead, nor Wonder is't, For Mother-Earth long since he kist; And what it was, full well did know, To turn his Heels up long ago. If any to enquire shall please What caus'd his Death, 'twas a Disease, Call'd Epilepse by learned Leech, But Falling-Sickness in plain Speech. And to confirm it for a Truth, He often foamed at the Mouth. And our good Coroner finds he hath, By his own stumbling, caus'd his Death. In King's Highway, pray let him rest, With this Inscription on his Breast: Here lies the Horse, that fell and rose before, But now (the Learned say) must rise no more. The Epsom Duel, 1689. I sing of a Duel in Epsom befel, 'Twixt fa-so-la Durfey, and so-la-mi Bell: But why do I mention the scribbling Brother? For naming the one, you may guess at the other. Betwixt them there happen'd a horrible Clutter, Bell set up the loud Pipes, and Durfey did splutter. Draw, Bell, wer't thou Dragon, I'll spoil thy soft Note, Thy squeaking, said t'other, for I'll cut thy Throat. With a Scratch on the Finger the Duel's dispatch'd, Thy Clineas (Oh Sidney!) was never so match'd. Prophecies out of Merlin's Carmen, 1690. Sure as ye live, who Arthur's Fate deplore, Heav'n for you has an Arthur yet in store; Behold his Deeds, and thence the Man proclaim, Tho' a gilt Helm on Riches stamp his Name. From Æolus he calls a ready Wind, And carries every Element his Friend, Heaven's Darling! Him no Instrument of War May touch, nor boldest Thunder singe his Hair. O Æolus! O ye Gods! The Ball is hurl'd, That Shoulder hurt, where will you fix the World. He, Britain's Angel, in one Moon shall mow The Flags and Rushes which in Bogland grow, The Lillies, a white Harvest, next shall crown His sacred Head, and all the World's his own Against God's Wind, tho' Hell may drive the Tide In the King's Chambers, tho' a Dolphin ride; Yet sure that Rout shall the proud Dragon rue, St. Michael comes with all his winged Crew; And Neptune will the Brutes no longer bear, Thunder begins, and Wonder ends the War. The Cavalcade, and disbanding the Royal Regiment; a Ballard for Jo. Haynes, 1690. I All you that have Protestant Ears to hear, Each of you prepare to shed a salt Tear; For know that our Monarch intends to disband The only brave Heroes could conquer Ireland. II The feirce Royal Regiment, as brave Men and willing, As Dutchmen, or Danes, or those Inneskilling, Must now be cashier'd without any Rewards, Who once did pretend to precede the King's Guards. III O had you but seen them march with that Decorum, That no Roman Triumph cou'd e'er go before them; Some smoaking, some whistling, all thinking no harm, Like Yorkshire Attornies coming up to a Term. IV On Long-Tails, on Bob-Tails, on Trotters, on Pacers, On Pads, Hawkers, Hunters, on Higlers, or Racers; You'd ha' sworn Knights, Squires, Prigs, Cuckolds and Panders, Appear'd all like so many Great Alexanders. V These Heroes, who thorow all Dangers durst go, Most bravely despising Blood, Battel, and Foe, Were mounted on Steeds the last Lord Mayor's Day, From Turkey, Spain, Barbary, Coach, Cart, and Dray. VI 'Twas on that very day their Prowess was shown, For guarding the King thro' the Fire-works o'th' Town; The Sparks were unhorst, and their lac'd Coats were spoil'd, Yet these fear'd no Squibs of Man, Woman, or Child. VII The Cornet, whose Nose tho' it spoke him no Roman, Was mounted that Day on a Horse feared no Man; Believe me, for all o'er his Trappings so sumptuous, He ty'd Squibs and Crackers, 'twas mighty presumptuous. VIII But note his Design, 'twas worth your admiring, 'Twas to let the Queen see how his Horse would stand firing; Not wisely considering what 'twas to be married, For at firing the Squibs his own Mistress miscarried. IX Th' Anabaptist, who squirts his Zeal into his Maid, In his Jackboots, both Night and Day, preach'd, slept, and pray'd; For jingling his Spurs chim'd them all in as well To Sermon, or Prayers, as any Sans-Bell. X The Lieutenant-Colonel being thrown by his Jennet, His Son-in-law thinking some Treachery in it, Did tender him the Oaths, which the Horse took they say, But swore by the Lord they went down like chopp'd Hay. XI He the Beast of an Irish Papist did buy, So doubting his Courage and his Loyalty, Taught him to eat with his Oates Gunpowdero, And prance to the Tune of old Lilly-Burlero. XII A noble stout Scrivener, who now shall be nameless, That in time of Action he might be found blameless; A War-Horse of Timber from a Dutch Carver buys, To learn with more Safety the Horse-Exercise. XIII With one Eye one's Honour, the other one's Gain, He fixes a Desk on Bucephalus' Main; That so by that means he his Palfry bestriding, Might practise at once both his writing and riding. XIV But o'the sad News that our Heroes confounds, To Ireland their own like the last Trumpet sounds; The King has invited Lord Mayor and Shreive Hublin, To dine upon Midsummer-Day with him in Dublin. XV Good Lord! how this News sets the Champions a trembling, And now quite forgetting their wonted dissembling, Can think them of nothing but Suits and Petitions, Of humble Addresses, of Terms and Conditions. XVI O who'll march for me? now speak any that dare, A Horse and a hundred Pounds for him that's fair; Dear Courtier excuse me from Teagueland and Slaughter, And take, which you please, my Wife or my Daughter. XVII Some feign'd to be lame, some feign'd to be clapt, At last finding they themselves had thus trapt, Unanimously they to the King all addrest, And told the bare Truth, 'twas all but a Jest. XVIII A Jest! quoth the King, and with that the King smil'd, It ne'er shall be said such a Jest shall be spoil'd; Therefore, now I break you, in Peace all depart, For 'twas more your Goodness than my Desert. XIX Thus happily freed from the dreadful Vexation, Of being Defenders of this or that Nation, They kiss'd Royal Fist, were drunk all for Joy, Then broke all their Swords, and cry'd, Vive le Roy. A BALLAD on the Times, 1696. I Good People, what will you of all be bereft? Will you never learn Wit while a Penny is left? We are all, like the Dog in the Fable, betray'd, To let go the Substance, and snap at the Shade: Our specious Pretences, And foreign Expences, To war for Religion, will wast all our Chink; It's clipt, and it's snipt, It's lent, and it's spent, Till 'tis gone, till 'tis gone, to the Devil, I think. II We pay for our New-born, and we pay for our Dead; We pay if w'are Single, we pay if we Wed: Which shews, that our merciful Senate don't fail To begin at the Head, and tax down to the Tail. We pay through the Nose, For subjecting of Foes; But, for all our Expences, get nothing but Blows: Abroad w'are defeated, At Home we are cheated; And the end on't, the end on't, the Lord above knows. III We have parted with all our old Money, to shew How we foolishly hope for a Plenty of New; But might have remember'd, when't came to the Push, That a Bird in the Hand, is worth two in the Bush: We now, like poor Wretches, Are kept under Hatches, At Rack and at Manger, like Beasts in the Ark; Since our Burgesses and Knights Make us pay for new Lights, Why shou'd we, why shou'd we be kept in the Dark? Love-Letters Written to Madam Maintenon, Stollen out of her Closet by one of her Servants. Translated by Mr. Tho. Brown. To my Adorable GUILLEMETTE. By the Same. I Fair Goddess! whose Victorious Charms Have made a Conquest o'er my Heart; When will you fill my long-expecting Arms, And bid my cruel Fears depart. II Since envious Fate your Absence has procur'd, No peaceful rest has crown'd the Night. The Day has seen no kind delight, Ten thousand Martyrdoms I have endur'd. III Come make a Victim of your Pride, Cure my Despair, and ease my Pain, Lay unbecoming Cruelty aside, And to mild Pity sacrifice Disdain. IV Or if my Fate you have decreed, And poor unhappy I must bleed, In a pathetick Tone pronounce my Death: And I with freedom will resign my Breath. Love-Verses, spoken to Adorable Guillemette: By the Marquiss of Cheveruse, after his recovery from a Fainting Fit. I Well now, imperious Fair, I find You have your Lover's Death design'd: Since you that could have eas'd my wretched State, Have added to my Cares, and urg'd my coming Fate. II Go take a Kiss, Love whispers in my Ear, But Love, alas! gives place to Fear; Aweful respect disarms my Hands, And to my growing Passion gives Commands. III Ah! must your wounded Lover die? And see his Balm, and see his Cure so nigh: Or shall he boldly seize a Kiss? A Prelude to a greater Bliss. IV No, he'll a thousand Deaths endure, And all Reverses of his Fate attend, E'er he'll by Sacrilege attempt his Cure, And his dear Guillemette offend. Monsieur Scarron's Sister's Verses on her Brother's being bilk'd of his Spouse's Maidenhead on the Marriage-Night. That Secret being reveal'd, broke the Poet's Heart. There's no body knows this Secret but I, Which I've heartily sworn to conceal, par may foy: And I've promis'd, without any damn'd Reservation, Not to utter one word to a Soul in the Nation. Then must I conceal it? alass and alack! I may promise as well to bear Pauls on my Back. But then if I tell it, I ruin my Brother, Why i'faith I can't help it, as well he as another. This telling of Secrets is part of our Charter, And for my part, I swear, I'll die no body's Martyr. Well, let me consider once more of the matter, Either burn, or disclose it; why, troth chuse the latter. But then if I speak it, farewel Reputation, And besides I may raise his severe Indignation, But what Woman alive can conceal Fornication? Not a Female on Earth can Cuckoldom smother, Then don't take it ill from your Sister, good Brother: You know what the Matron said unto her Daughter, Ne'er long keep a Secret, nor long hold your Water. To Mr. Synh????m at Cambridge. On the Death of Mrs. Bilton. What could'st not thou a blooming Beauty spare? And must your Dart descend on such a Fair? Lucinda's dead, and has resign'd the Prize To fainter Charms, and less inviting Eyes. But 'tis a Sign thou'rt blind, regardless Death, A Vandal wou'd have spar'd that valid Breath: But thou'rt all Ice, unalterably cold; Uncharm'd by Beauty, and unbrib'd by Gold: Whilst zealous Vows did in the Church ascend Beyond the Stars, I could not but offend; I fix'd my Eyes, and Thoughts, and Heart on you, As a just Debt, and absolutely Due. Nor shall that Day escape my Calendar, When you ascended, and became a Star. No, I will consecrate your final Hour, No Time shall e'er your Memory devour; Lasting as Virtue shall thy darling Name Survive the Tomb, and aged Honour claim, And shine for ever in the Rolls of Fame. Your humble Servant, T. R. The Fable of the Wolf and Porcupine: In Answer to The Argument against a Standing Army. I Isgrim, with Hunger press'd, one Day As thro' the Woods he posted, A Porcupine found on the way, And in these Terms accosted. II Our Wars are ended, Heav'n be prais'd! Then let's sit down and prattle Of Towns invested, Sieges rais'd, And what we did in Battle. III The Plains a pleasing Prospect yield, No Fire, nor Desolation; While Plenty reigns in every Field, And Trade restores the Nation. IV Yet you your Quills erected wear, And tho' none seeks to harm ye; In time of Peace about you bear, Methinks, a Standing Army. V Friend, quoth the Porcupine, 'tis true, The War's at length decided; But 'gainst such tricking Blades as you 'Tis good to be provided. VI Censorious Fame shall never say, That too much Faith betray'd me; Who thinks of me to make a Prey, Must at his Cost invade me. VII Let him, that thinks it worth the while, Tempt Knaves to make a Martyr; The Sharpers that would me beguile, Shall find they've caught a Tartar. An EPITAPH upon ABRAHAM, a Taylor's Wife. From Abraham's Bosom, full of Lice, To Abraham's Bosom in Paradice; Poor Sarah's Ghost has took its Flight, And bid the lousy Rogue Good-Night. An EPITAPH upon Barren Peg. Here lies the Body of Barren Peg, Who had no Issue, but her Leg: But, to her Praise, for she had that Cunning, Whilst one stood still, the other was running. T. Brown. The Cornuted Beaux: Or, a Satyr upon Marriage. Beaugard. It can't be he! Courtine! the Brisk! the Gay! What Hag has stoll'n the Fiend and Man away? What Monster is he metamorphos'd to? How all unlike the jolly Thing we knew? Such Underwoods have over-run the Coast, In his Beard's Thicket all his Face is lost; That hanging Look sad Guesses does invite, And on his wrinkled Forehead, Husband write. Courtine. For thy unseasonable Mirth a Curse, As heavy as that Fiend that haunts me thus; That Constellation of Plagues be thine, Which spightful Heaven has doom'd with Sylvia mine: Be thou condemn'd to lug an endless Life, The Gally-Slave to an eternal Wife. Beaugard. A friendly Wish! But Partners would destroy That Bliss, which none but one can well enjoy: Lucky Courtine, how ev'n in spight of me Does thy good Fortune make me envy thee? How like the neat Sir Davy, sage and wise, New Aldermen sit budding in her Eyes! A Face so fair as Sylvia's sure might move, Spight of his Hymns, a bloodless Angel's Love; And then what dull Platonick can behold The Beauty, and the Virtue of her Gold? The Atheist thinks a merry Life does well, Bartering short pleasant Toys for a long future Hell. To Lovers thus the happy Night alone For a whole Age of Torments might attone; After a Day of Eating, which might vie With the Lord Mayor's, or shrival Luxury: See where a Drove of envious wishing Friends Around thy Bed, the Bower of Bliss attends; Each Squinting Gallant prays thy Place were his, And by Delays excel the coming Bliss: Sack-posset then, while each green Virgin throws Prophetick Stocking at thy patient Nose. Sack-posset still, and when they that remove, Next—enters the sweet Sillibub of LOVE. Soft Musick then thy Laziness must chide, And give a fair Excuse to leave the Bride; Not wooing Puss can louder Songs compose, Nor more Diversity of Airs than those. Harmonious City-Musick; such a Bliss, 'Twere worth the while to marry but for this. Nor must you think the Joys should end so soon, There's yet a live-long heavenly-hony-moon; In Wedlocks pleasing Team, with equal Law, Thy courteous Yoke-fellow must ever draw, While Pictures of thy kind laborious Bride Shall still run softly bellowing by thy Side. Courtine. Since my fair Pack so wond'rously does please, Thy Shoulders lend, and be an Hercules: I feel a Load, a heavy Hell above, For the expected gaudy Heaven of Love; How then would you those Tinsel Pleasures find With which fly jilting Nature bribes Mankind? SATED FRUITION does the Bliss destroy, And the next Moment knows not the Tumultuous Joy. Who can reflect without just Rage and Fright And deep Regret on such a mean Delight? Ye Gods! if these Loves highest Banquets be, Brutes can love me, and better far than we: This knew sly Jove, who when he left the Skies, Chose rather any other Beast's Disguise, The Bull, nay, th' improportionable Swan, Much more the lusty Ass can rival Man, Who all their Pleasure in Possession find, Without the curst Allay, and Sting behind; As Nature prompts, promiscuously they rove, And hunt free Joys, through ev'ry Field and Grove, But in a Pound, what Brutes wou'd e'en make Love? Man, Man alone is damn'd to grinding still, And in the Prison of his Cage must bill; Like a blind Stallion ever drudges on, And gets new Slaves for Wives to ride upon; Night-mar'd, like me, whom gastly Sights pursue, And scar'd with her lean Ghost, whom once I knew. That Sylvia's now no more, who, big with Charms, Dropt a whole Dow'r of Pleasure in your Arms; Loose hangs the Flower, lately so fresh and gay, And every Tempest bears new Leaves away. Unlovely now it flags, and overblown, And ev'ry Grace, and ev'ry Charm is gone; Her Tenderness is fond, and awkward grows, And all her Female Art affected shows. True Hag all o'er: Ugly she grows, and old, And knowing this, turns jealous and a Scold; Fletcher's Wife-tamer durst not dare to love her, Xantippe was a patient Grizel to her; Each Look, each Step I tread's by her survey'd; She haunts me like my Conscience, or my Shade, Expects a Statue I should constant prove, And daily damns my unperforming Love: Whene'er for Quiets-sake she hooks me in, Heavens! how she ruffles in her Buckrum Skin, And frights my Soul away from the Imbrace; No Mummy looks so dreadful as her Face. So when from Gibbets and the Common-shore Th' officious Devil has pimp'd, and brought his Friend a Whore, So shrieks the Wretch, when he next Morn has spy'd A ghastly Carcass rotting by his side. Just such a Lot is mine; I drudge my Life Worse than with Legion far, possess'd with WIFE: Wou'd Fate and Hell some higher Ill provide, And club for any other Plague beside, I soon should easy and contented grow, In spight of Bolts above, and Flames below: No—such luxurious Ease I ask in vain, And like poor Adam must alive remain, Whom 'vengeful Fate did to curs'd Woman chain, In Judgment gave him an unkind Reprieve, And damn'd him to ten thousand Hells in Eve. On the first Fit of the Gout. Welcome thou friendly Earnest of fourscore Promise of Wealth, that hast alone the pow'r T' attend the Rich, unenvied by the Poor; Thou that dost Æsculapius deride, And o'er his Gallipots in Triumph ride. Thou that art us'd t' attend the Royal Throne, And underprop the Head that bears the Crown. Thou that dost oft in Privy Council wait, And drive from drowsy Sleep the Eyes of State. Thou that upon the Bench art mounted high, And warn'st the Judges how they tread awry; Thou that art half the sober City's Grace, And adds to solemn Noddle solemn Pace. Thou that dost oft from pamper'd Prelate Toe Emphatically urge the Pains below: Thou that art us'd, on amorous Ladies Knee, To feed on Jellies, and to drink cold Tea: Thou that art never from Velvet Slippers free, Whence comes this unsought Honour unto me? Whence does this mighty Condescension flow To visit my poor Tabernacle? Oh!— Thus Jove himself, from Ida's Top, 'tis said, At poor Philemon's Cot once took his Bed; And pleas'd with his kind hospitable Feast, Jove bid him ask, and granted his Request: So do thou grant (for thou art of Race Divine, Begot on Bacchus, the Great God of Wine) My humble Suit, and either give me Store To entertain thee, or ne'er see me more. A DIALOGUE between a Cuckoldy Courtier and his Lady. Husband. Should modest Ladies steal abroad, Mobb'd up like Common Punks or Bawd, Without their Stays, in wanton Dresses, Just fit for amorous Caresses. What base Intrigue are you upon? And whither, Madam, is't you run? Squirting about in Hackney Coach, Like Jilt in quest of new Debauch. Without your Footman, or your Maid, As if you fear'd to be betray'd; Sneak home by Night at twelve a Clock, Discharge your Coach before you knock: Then gently tapping are, with Caution, Let in by her that waits your Motion. And when you've slily crept up Stairs, Pretend to go an Hour to Pray'rs; As if Devotion was design'd For nothing but a Holy Blind: So pious Jilts, that kiss and pray, Repent, and sin again next Day. Lady. Bless me! my Dear! you're wond'rous free; What means this Fit of Jealousy? Am I a Vassal or a Wife? Your Lady, or a Slave for Life? Must I, to please your Whim, be ty'd In my own Coach always to ride? Sute all my Actions to the Eyes Of Servants, and be watch'd by Spies? Suppose I had a mind to call At Pinners, or at Salters-Hall; Only for once or so, to hear The Low-Church way of preaching there: Or that, upon some publick Day, I long'd to hear old Daniel Burghess pray; Not thro Devotion, I protest, But purely for a Pulpit-Jest. Since we are Church-Folks, it is fitting The World should know I go to th' Meeting. When if my Equipage should wait At Door, the Town would know it strait: And where's the harm, if, in these Cases, I go disguis'd to such-like Places? Husband. Good Heavens! what would Woman do, To cloke the Vices they pursue? And paint their Ills with pious Cheating, If 'twas not for the Church or Meeting? Religion, once the Prop of State, What is't thou'rt become of late? The very Scandal of the Gown, The common Banter of the Town; As manag'd now, the Nation's Curse, Th' aspiring Villian's Stalking-Horse; The Trader's holy Face and Mien, To hide the Knave that lurks within; The Cause of ev'ery spightful Jar, The Bane of Peace, and Drum of War; The Wife's Excuse, whene'er she flies To satiate on forbidden Joys: In short, 'tis now a Cloke put on For every Evil that is done; Therefore, pray Madam, cease your prating, Of going mobb'd to Church or Meeting: When yon steal out in such loose Dresses, I know you find more private Places; Not to serve God, but to promote The Pleasure of the Petticoat; And to be safe, whilst you comply With Ills you cannot justify. Lady. My Dear, to hear you talk so odly, 'Twould vex me, were I ne'er so Godly; But as you fancy, pray suppose, (For Jealousy's the De'il, God knows) That when I'm mobb'd in such a pickle, I am too wanton or too fickle, To trouble Church or Conventicle. But have, perhaps, a mind to see Some foolish Curiosity, Th' Arabian Goat, or some such Creature, Whose Horns are Miracles in Nature: Or if by chance I take a loose To do what's more ridiculous; And, blushing, laugh an Hour away, To see the Moorfields Strolers play; Who by their aukward Struts transverse A Tragedy into a Farce; Or, vice versa, make you weep, At Comedy, till fast asleep: Thus when they mean that we should cry, We laugh, to see their Lovers die, They do't so very aukwardly. And when they come to make us glad, Their Tragick Tone still keeps us sad; Therefore, my Dear, if I take pleasure In such Fanatick Whims as these are; Where is the Scandal, or the Crime, Of a Hack-Coach at such a time; And, without Equipage, to go In Dishabelle to see a Show; Since Lords and Ladies often strole From Court as far as Hockley-Hole, To see the Dogs, the Bulls, and Bears Halloo'd together by the Ears? For tho' some think such rugged Sport Too rugged for the nobler Sort, I vow 'tis but a Jest; for we That call our selves the Quality, Have all our Whims; act, jest, and talk, And play the Fool like other Folk; Only our Grandeur cheats their Eyes, And makes them think we are more wise. Husband. But I hear, Madam, you are fam'd For a worse Sport than you have nam'd; And that your Hackneys and Disguises Are all but infamous Devices To drive on your Intrigues the better, And make my sprouting Shame the greater What must I bring you first to Court, And then be thus rewarded for't? Was it for this your Pride aspir'd To dwell among the fawning Herd? That you might prostitute your Charms To this and that gay Blockhead's Arms? And with a Bastard mottled Race My antient Family debase By your curs'd Tail and tempting Looks, Make it as spurious as a Duke's? But I'll revenge the Wrongs you've done me, Or a worse Plague shall light upon me. Lady. Prithee, my Dear, don't let your Passion Thus rise without just Provocation; My Lady Backwell can inform you, I ne'er do any thing to harm you; For whensoe'er I steal abroad, Mobb'd up in Furbelow or Hood; I never fail to call upon her; And none can touch her spotless Honour: Therefore you need not doubt your Wife, She'll witness my obedient Life, And all the Liberties I take, Where-e'er I go behind your Back. But Men, I find, will still distrust Their Wives, altho' they're ne'er so just; And from the Guilt of their own Vices, Punish themselves with strange Surmises. Husband. It is not all your sham Pretences Can longer smother your Offences; You need not go Incog. to see The Arabian Goat, but look at me: Your wanton Tail has made my Crest Vie Antlers with that monstrous Beast: Long have I guess'd, by your loose Carriage, You've broke the solemn Vows of Marriage. But now I know my Fate as certain, As if my Eyes had seen my Fortune; And that my Forehead could proclaim Your Faults to my eternal Shame. Lady. Be patient till your Horns appear, Don't be so positive, my Dear; Because he only is, you know, The Cuckold who believes he's so. What foolish Story has possest Your Noddle, and inflam'd your Breast? What servile Sycophant or Spy Has brib'd your Friendship with a Lye? And, for the sake of some By-End, Has slily prov'd a treach'rous Friend? Prithee believe no idle Tales Of what I did at Tunbridge-Wells. Or what fine Spark among the Beaux At Bath for a Gallant I chose. The World's ill-natur'd and censorious, And modest Wives, whose Charms are glorious, Are often falsly made notorious. He that would lead a happy Life, Must always listen to his Wife; And for the Truth depend upon her, In all things that respect her Honour: For he that ever lends an Ear To common Fame, that common Lyar, May be a Cuckold in his Thought, Altho his Lady ne'er was naught. Thus 'tis not what we really are, That frets the jealous Breast with Care; But what we think our selves to be, That oft creates our Misery. Then what dull Sot would horn his Brows, By harb'ring Evil of his Spouse; Since if he thinks her chaste and good, No Cukold's he, tho' she be lewd? Husband. The Jilt does many ways devise To blind her injur'd Husband's Eyes; Will still persuade the Fool she's chaste, Tho ne'er so loose about the Waste; Especially if not detected I'th' Fault of which she is suspected. But I've discover'd your Abuse Of Marriage, far beyond Excuse; Have prov'd at last too Cunning for ye, And found just Reasons to abhor ye. Lady. Prithee, my Dear, don't shew your Heat, So like a Cuckold in Conceit; And vent your Spleen, as if your Eyes Had witness'd my Infirmities. Perhaps your jealous Ears have heard, I'm much admir'd by such a Lord; And that we met some Afternoon At Chelsea, or at Kensington: What then, can't Lords and Ladies take A Frisk for Conversation's sake? Be merry o'er a Flask or two, Drink a cool Sillibub or so; But like salucious Punks and Play'rs, They must defile the Tavern Chairs? O foh! I hate a jealous Sot, That harbours such a Beastly Thought. I'm sure they must have led ill Lives, That judge so hardly of their Wives; For those, who are themselves unjust, Are always fullest of Distrust. Husband. Most rarely urg'd, imperious Creature! Cunning by Practice, leud by Nature A most incomparable Plea For faithless Woman's Liberty; If a Man once be well assur'd His Lady rambles with my Lord, And meets his Honour up and down In Holes and Corners out of Town: I think he has Cause enough to guess His Wife has foul'd her Wat'ring-Place; And ought, I say, to take't for granted, His Horns are very firmly planted. What Business can a Wife pretend To have with any strong-back'd Friend; But to oblige her lustful Passion With base adult'rous Recreation? Therefore its Proof enough, Pox take her! To know she meets her Cuckoldmaker; For would she have her Husband see, As the Law calls it, Rem in Re? Lady. O fie upon you! by my Life Your Talk's enough to spoil a Wife: There's stuff indeed, I thought that no Man Would use such words before a Woman. Husband. You're mighty modest by your prating, But Pox take him that taught you Latin: I find you have been made by some Man Too good a Scholar for a Woman. Lady. I'm not so ignorant, you may see, As you believe your Wife to be; Perhaps your Jealousy in time, May improve my Knowledge to a Crime; And make you apt to think me naught, Because I understand what's what. I've read, my Dear, I must allow, The Tryal of a Rape e'er now; Yet ne'er was ravish'd in my Life, Before, or since, I've been your Wife: Therefore, I hope, you don't distrust I'm disobedient or unjust; Because, my Dear, I dont' applaud ye, For speaking fulsome Latin Bawdy. Husband. You banter, Madam, mighty well; I know you've Tongue, as well as Tail: Both which have not only been try'd By me, but many more beside. Who was it call'd the other Day At Man's, upon Sir Frederick Gay; Took him into her Hackney Coach, And carry'd off the young Debauch; At Whitehall-stairs took Boat just after, And to Spring-Gardens cross'd the Water; There spent six hours, to both your shame, In doing what's too bad to name. Lady. I'll take my Oath 'twas none of I, If't it had, I'd scorn to tell a Lye. Sir Frederick! By my Life and Soul, I know the Gentleman, that's all. But pray, my Dear, suppose I had Done what you say, you've done as bad. Who was it took a homely, cloudy, Lascivious, poor, theatrick Dowdy; Cloth'd her as richly, and as fine, As if her Charms had outshone mine: Down from the Garret brought the Jilt To Holland Sheets, and Sattin Quilt; Kept her as if she'ad been a Dutchess, To please and humour your Debauches? How then can you expect I'll be True to a Man that false to me; Since I have Youth and Beauty too, At least, I'm sure, enough for you? Husband. Both Sexes love the pleasing Sport, It is a reigning Vice at Court; I've had my am'rous Freaks, 'tis true, And so, I'm satisfy'd have you; Therefore what's Honour but a Cheat Among the Noble and the Great? Since we of Wealth and high Degree, Who boast of Birth and Quality, Are far more base behind the Curtain, Than those content with meaner Fortune. On PLEASURE: Out of French. Well, whate'er Sins by Turns have sway'd me, Ambition never reach'd my Heart; Its leud Pretences ne'er betray'd me, In publick Ills to act a part. Let others Fame or Wealth pursuing, Despise a mean, but safe Retreat; I'll ne'er contrive my own Undoing, Nor stoop so low as to be Great. The faithless Court, the tricking Change, What solid Pleasures can they give? Oh let me in the Country range! 'Tis there we breathe, 'tis there we live. The beauteous Scene of aged Mountains, Smiling Valleys, murmuring Fountains, Lambs in flow'ry Pastures bleating, Eccho our Complaints repeating. Bees with busy Sounds delighting, Groves to gentle Sleep inviting; Whisp'ring Winds the Poplars courting, Swains in rusty Circles sporting; Birds, in chearful Notes, expressing Nature's Bounty, and their Blessing: These afford a lasting Pleasure, Without Guilt, and without Measure. An EPITAPH upon the charming PEGGY. Under this Marble Peggy lies, Who did so often spread her Thighs, And made Philander's Courage rise. This Morsel of delicious Lust, That kiss'd with so sincere a Gust, Is now resolv'd to common Dust. Her Hands (forgive me if I am blunt) Will now no more, as they were wont Pilot Loves Sailors to her— Her Limbs, that us'd to move so nice, And taste Love's Pleasures in a trice, Are now, alas! as cold as Ice. To tell the Truth, as short as can be, She kill'd her self with drinking Brandy, And all for her dear Jack-a-Dandy. Thus did our charming Nymph expire, According to her Heart's Desire, And as she liv'd, she dy'd by Fire. The Name of his Danish Dog. Hector, my Boy, of thee I beg Not to forget the illustrious Peg, But o'er her Tomb lift up thy Leg. Then piss such Deluges of Rain, In so exuberant a Strain, As shall o'erflow the World again. This Tribute's to her Ashes due, Whose Loss ten thousand Youths will rue; And so, immortal Peg, adieu. On the Death of the Duke of GLOUCESTER. By Mr. Brown. For Gloucester's Death, which sadly we deplore, Though Fate's accused, we should commend it more; Lest he with Burnet's Faith should be imbrued, Or learn of C? Truth or Gratitude: Lest two such Masters should their Rules instil, And his young Soul with poisonous Precepts fill. Untimely Fate Heaven timely did employ, And to preserve the Man, destroy'd the Boy. An EPITAPH upon Dr. Burnet, late Bishop of Salisbury. By the Same. Here old Sarum lies, As great as wise, And learned as Tom Aquinas; Lawn-Sleeves he wore, And yet no more A Christian than Socinus. Oaths Pro &amp; Con He swallow'd down, Took Fees like any Layman; Read, preach'd, and pray'd, And yet betray'd God's Holy Word for Mammon. Of every Vice He had a Spice Tho' a renowned Prelate; Yet liv'd and dy'd, If not bely'd, A true Dissenting Zealot: If such a Soul, To Heav'n is stole, And escaped old Satan's Clutches; We'll then presume, There may be room For ? The Epilogue written by Mr. Brown, and spoke by Jo. Haines, in the Habit of an Horse-Officer, mounted on an Ass. You have seen (before now) since this Shape-shewing Age, More Asses than mine, on a Beaucrowded Stage, Wherefore by th' Example of fam'd Dogget, my Brother, To shew our Stage has Asses, as well as the other; Thus mounted I'm come, to invite ye oft hither, To Beaumont and Fletcher, thus coupled together; My Fancy, his Judgment, my Person, his Face, With the mighty good Interest he has in this Place; For indeed, as I'm told, pray let me not wrong ye, My Ass has Relations, and Great ones among ye; In the Galleries, Side-Boxes, on the Stage, in the Pit, What's your Critick, your Beau, your Keeper, your Wit? Your fighting Ass is a Bully, Your sneaking Ass is a Cit; Your keeping Ass is a Cully, But your Top, prime Ass, is your Wit. They all fool Cit of his Wife. He fools 'em all of their Pelf; But your Wit's so damn'd an Ass, He only fools himself. Writing one Play a Year, for a Wit he'd pass, His lean third Day makes out to him he's an Ass. Ben't I an Ass now, thus to mount my Brother, But he that's pleas'd with it too, is not he another? Are we not Asses all ('twixt me and you) To part with our old Money 'till we were sure of new? [Fine old Money. Since then so many Asses here abound, Where an eternal Link of Wit goes round; No Poet sure will think it a Disgrace, To be ally'd to this accomplish'd Ass, But he's a Critick, you may read it in his Face. As for his Courage, truly I can't say much, Yet, he might serve for a Trooper among the Dutch. Tho of their Side I'm sure he'd never Fight, His Passive Obedience shews I'm in the Right. [Whips the Ass often, who, by reason of his innate dulness, never flinches for it.] He's a Courtier, sit to appear before a Queen. Advance, Bucephalus! View but his Mien: Ladies, I'm sure you like his spruce Behaviour; I ne'er knew ought but Asses in your Favour. Fair Ones, at what I say, take no Offence, For ? When his Degree a Lover does commence, You coin an Ass out of a Man of Sense. Your Beauxs, that soften so your flinty Hearts, They are Asses ? Taylors make them Men of Parts. Now, some have told me, this might give Offence, That riding my Ass thus, is riding the Audience: But what of that? The Brother rides the Brother; The Son the Father; we all ride one another. Then for a Jest, for this Time, let it pass; For he that takes it ill, I'm sure's an Ass. The Ladies Lamentation for their Adonis: Or, an Elegy on the Death of Mr. Mountford the Player. I Poor Mountford is gone, and the Ladies do all Break their Hearts for this Beau, as they did for D'Val, And they the two Brats for this Tragedy damn, At Kensington-Court, and the Court of Bantam. They all vow and swear, That if any Peer Shou'd acquit the young Lord, he shou'd pay very dear; Nor will they be pleas'd with him, who on Throne is, If he do's not his Part, to revenge their Adonis. II With the Widow, their amorous Bowels do yearn; There are divers pretend to an equal Concern; And, by her Persuasion, their Hearts they reveal, In case of not guilty to bring an Appeal. They all will unite, The young Blades to indite, And in Prosecution will joyn Day and Night; In the mean while, full many a Tear and Groan is, Where'er they meet, for their departed Adonis. III With the Ladies foul Murder's a horrible Sin, Of one handsome without, tho' a Coxcomb within; For not being a Beau, the sad Fate of poor Crab, Tho' himself hang'd for Love, was a Jest to each Drab: Then may Jer'my live long, And may Risby among The Fair, with Jack Barkley, and Culpeper throng; May no Ruffian, whose Heart as hard as a Stone is, Kill any of these for a Brother Adonis. IV No Lady henceforth can be safe with her Beau, They think, if this Slaughter unpunish'd shou'd go; Their Gallants, for whose Persons they most are in Pain, Must no sooner be envy'd, but strait must be slain. For all Bracegirdle's Shape, None car'd for the Rape, Nor whether the Virtuous their Lust did escape, Their Trouble of Mind, and their Anguish alone, is For the too sudden Fate of departed Adonis. V Let not ev'ry vain Spark think that he can engage The Heart of a Female, like one on the Stage; His Face, and his Voice, and his Dancing, are rare, And wherever they meet they prevail with the Fair: But no Quality Top, Charms like Mr. Hop, Adorn'd on the Stage, and in East-India Shop; So that each from Miss Felton, to ancient Drake Jone is Bemoaning the Death of the Player Adonis. VI Yet Adonis in spight of this new Abjuration, Did banter the lawful King of this great Nation; Who call'd God's Anointed a foolish old Prig, Was both a base and unmannerly Whig; But since he is dead, No more shall be said, For he in Repentance has laid down his Head; So I wish each Lady, who in mournful Tone is, In Charity grieve for the Death of Adonis. On the Death of the Duke of Gloucester, being a Satyr on Dr. Ratcliffe, for his Neglect. In vain we grieve, in vain we waste our Eyes, And with Expostulations rend the Skies; All our Complaints we must on Ratcliffe spend, Who, for his Pleasure, can neglect his Friend: By whose Delays more Patients sure have dy'd, Than by the Drugs of others, misapply'd. Three Bottles keep him, and for their dear Sake, Three Kingdoms unregarded lie at Stake. A saucy Humour, thus to over-rate His Pleasure and his Ease, to come too late To such a Prince, the Hopes of such a State. Alas! To throw away some common Life's a Crime, That one can ne'er atone for all his Time; But to neglect a Life of such a Price, Swells the Offence to a much larger Size; The Guilt must, as our Loss, in Measure rise. In him we all had liv'd; his single Fate Therefore must needs affect the publick State. So choice a Member from the Body torn, Leaves the rest bleeding; for, to say we mourn, Do's not enough express our solemn Grief, Such as can scarce admit, or find Relief. Who can forgive? And yet forgive we must, For he's the only Man that we can trust; Bewitch'd with Apprehensions of his Skill, We thereby give him Pow'r and Leave to kill. If by his future Care he wou'd retrieve His Fame, and thereby Satisfaction give, Let him (and 'tis the least that he can do) His boasted Immortality bestow. On the Duke of Marlborough's Victory at Hochstet, in 1704. The conqu'ring Genius of our Isle returns; Inspir'd by Anne, the Godlike Hero burns; Retrieves the Fame our ill-led Troops had lost, And spreads reviving Valour through the Host. In distant Climes the wond'ring Foe alarms, And with new Thunder Austria's Eagle arms. The Danube's Banks, forgetting Cæsar's Name, Shall echo to the Sound of Marlb'rough's Fame. The Shepherds Pipes rejoyce o'er Gallick Blood, And with eternal Purple stain the Flood. Upon the Paper Project, for raising of Money. Pray, Sir, did you hear of a late Proclamation, Of sending Paper for Payment quite thro' the Nation? Yes, Sir, I have, They're your Mountague's Notes, Tinctur'd and colour'd by your Parliament Votes: But 'tis plain on the People to be but a Toast; For they go by the Carrier, and come by the Post. The happiest Day of Marriage. In Marriage are two Things allow'd, A Wife in Wedding Sheets, and in a Shroud: How can a Marry'd State then be a-curst, Since the last Day's as happy as the first? EPIGRAM Translated thus, by Mr. Tho. Brown. Coming a tender Girl from School, Marrying, I met a thund'ring Tool: But fit for Love's Embraces grown, I've got a Man that's next to none. The first with Youth's too vig'rous Warmth inspir'd, With Love's untasted Joys my Weakness tir'd. My second grunting Spark, cold to Love's Charms, He fills my Bed, 'tis true, but not my Arms. When I'd no Appetite, Love cloy'd me; Now I've a Mind to't, 'tis deny'd me. Oh! Hymen, Hymen, for my Quiet, Contract my Stomach, or enlarge my Diet. An Epigram of Flaminius, to his drinking Mistress. Chloe, you write to me for Coin, And in Return I send you Wine; Like Wealth, its Pow'r is equally divine. E'en stick to that, 'twill make you merry, For mine or other's Absence chear ye; That softens ev'ry Nymph that's cruel, For mellow Venus is a Jewel. So Ariadne, when her Wanderer, False Theseus, left her, wash'd off Grief and Care, Enjoy'd God Bacchus, and became a Star. On the Earl of Torrington. Stain of thy Country, and thy ancient Name, Traytor to Honour, and old England's Shame; Great Effingham's Reverse, and Greenvill's Foil, Thou dost, vile Dastard, all their Triumphs spoil. Thy Cowardice disturbs their very Urn, And is enough to make their Ashes mourn. Arise, ye noble Ghosts of valiant Drake, Frobisher, Cav'ndish, Mountague, and Blake; You, who our Neighbour-Navies did confound, And made our Fame from Sea to Sea resound, Grieve now to see your Trophies from us torn, The Sea, your Mistress, helpless and forlorn; Mourn to behold a lustful proud Poltroon, Eclypse those Glories you for us have won. The Poet's Will, at the Whig's Festival. Yonder your Author stands extreamly Ill, And, yet of perfect Mind, thus makes his Will. First, I bequeath my Soul, when I forsake it, To him that has the truest Right to take it; My Body next, let me consider well, To those that will convey it out of Smell: My worldly Goods, altho' they are but few, My Brother Poets, those I leave to you; And were I sure that they'd accept of it, The Rhyming Quality shou'd share my Wit: To Daniel, and his Friend the Observator, I leave my Manuscripts, and Scottish Psalter, With all my Volumes that have scap'd my Bum, From the Wise Masters to the fam'd Tom Thumb. Next I bequeath, (but let me recollect, I fain wou'd something leave to ev'ry Sect) To all our grave Divines, where e'er they be, I leave them, what they want, my Charity; And to those Prelates that oppose the Bill, Were I secure, they wou'd not take it Ill, To them and their Heirs I'd give and grant My Model of the Godly Covenant. The Presbyterians too I'd something give, Tho' they're so rich I know not what to leave, Besides, they're grown so very proud withal, They won't accept of any Thing that's small; And yet, methinks, 'tis fit that they shou'd have Some Marks of my Remembrance in my Grave; Among my Lumber they will Papers find, Writ to inform the Realm what they design'd; That they have them, it is my sole Intention, They'll be of Use against a Comprehension. The Quakers too expect their Legacy, To those good Men I leave my Modesty; And let the other Sects, that I mayn't wrong 'em, Take my Religion and divide among 'em. And to conclude, it is my Will and Mind, Some honest wealthy Cit would be so kind, To see all this perform'd, and for his Pains, To take for him, and for his Heirs, my Brains. The Fable of the Lion and the Beasts. One Time a mighty Plague did pester All Beasts Domestick and Silvester. The Doctors all in Consult join'd, To see if they the Cause could find, And try'd a world of Remedies, But none could conquer the Disease. The Lyon, in this Consternation, Sends out his Royal Proclamation, To all his loving Subjects Greeting, Appointing them a solemn Meeting. And when theyr'e gather'd round his Den, He spoke, My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope you're met full of the Sense Of this devouring Pestilence: For sure such heavy Punishment On common Crimes is rarely sent. It must be some important Cause, Some great Infraction of the Laws. Then let us search our Consciences, And ev'ry one his Faults confess; Let's judge from biggest to the least, That he that is the foulest Beast, May for Sacrifice be given, To stop the Wrath of angry Heaven. And since no one is free from Sin, I with my self will first begin. I have done many a Thing that's ill, From a Propensity to kill; Slain many an Ox, and what is worse, Have murder'd many a gallant Horse; Robb'd Woods and Fens, and like a Glutton, Devour'd whole Flocks of Lamb and Mutton. Nay, sometimes, for I dare not Lye, The Shepherd went for Company. He had went on, but Chancellor Fox Stands up, What signifies an Ox? What signifies a Horse, such Things Are honour'd when made Sport for Kings? Then for the Sheep, those foolish Cattle, Not fit for Carriage, or for Battle, And being tolerable Meat, They're good for nothing but to eat. The Shepherd too, your Enemy, Deserves no better Destiny. Sir, Sir, your Conscience is too nice, Hunting's a Princely Exercise; And these being all your Vassals born, Just when you please are to be torn. And, Sir, if this will not content you, We'll vote it Nemine contradicente. Thus, after him, they all confess They had been Rogues, some more, some less; And yet, by little slight Excuses, They all got clear of great Abuses. The Bear, the Tyger, Beasts of Fight, And all that could but scratch and bite; Nay, e'en the Cat, of wicked Nature, That kills in Sport her Fellow-Creature, Went scot-free; but his Gravity, An Ass, of stupid Memory, Confess'd i'th' Road to Tunbridge-Fair, His Back half broke with wooden Ware, Chancing unluckily to pass By a Church-yard full of good Grass, Finding they'd open left the Gate, He ventur'd in, stoop'd down, and eat. Hold, says Judge Wolf, these are the Crimes Have brought upon us these sad Times; By several Acts of Parliament 'Tis Sacrilege, and this vile Ass Deserves to dye for eating holy Grass. The Fable shews us poor Mens Fate, Whilst Laws can never reach the Great. An Elegy on the Death of Mr. Edward Millington, the famous Auctioneer. Mourn, mourn, you Booksellers, for cruel Death Has robb'd the famous Auctioneer of Breath: He's gone, he's gone! ah! the great Loss deplore, Great Millington, alas! he is no more: No more will he now at your Service stand Behind the Desk, with Mallet in his Hand. No more the Value of your Books set forth, And sell 'em by his Art for twice their Worth. Methinks I see him still with smiling Look Amidst the Crowd, and in his Hand a Book, Then in a fine facetious pleasing Way, The Author's Genius and his Wit display. O all ye scribbling Tribe, come mourn his Death, Whose Wit hath giv'n your dying Fame new Birth: When your neglected Works did mouldring lie Upon the Shelves, and none your Books would buy, How oft has he, with strained Eloquence, Affirm'd the Leaves contain'd a world of Sense, When all's insipid dull Impertinence. Come, Gentlemen, come, bid me what you please; Upon my Word, it is a curious Piece, Done by a learned Hand, and neatly bound: What say you, come, I'll put it up one Pound: One Pound, once, twice? Fifteen: Who bids a Crown; Then shakes his Head with an affected Frown; Good-lack-a-day, 'tis strange; then strikes a Blow, And in a feigned Passion bids it go: Then in his Hand another Piece he takes, And in its Praise a long Harangue he makes; And tells 'em that 'tis writ in lofty Verse, One that is out of Print, and very scarce; Then with high Language, and a stately Look, He sets a lofty Price upon the Book: Five Pound, four Pound, three Pound, he cries aloud, And holds it up, and shews it to the Crowd, With Arm erect, the Bidders to provoke, To raise the Price before th' impending Stroke: This in the Throng does Emulation breed, And makes 'em strive each other to out-bid, While he descants upon their learned Heats, And his facetious Dialect repeats: For none like him for certain knew so well, By way of Auction any Goods to sell. 'Tis endless to express the Ways he had To sell the Good, and to put off the Bad. But, ah! in vain I strive his Fame to spread; The great, the wise, the knowing Man is dead. And you in Painting skill'd, his Loss bewail, He's dead that did expose your Works to Sale, See how he lies, all dismal, wan, and pale: No more by him your Praise will be express'd, For, ah! he's gone to his eternal Rest: Can you forget how he for you did bawl, Come, put it in, a fine Original, Done by a curious Hand: what Strokes are here Drawn to the Life, how fine it does appear! O lovely Piece, Ten Pound, Five Pound, for Shame; You do not bid the Value of the Frame! How many pretty Stories would he tell, To inhaunce the Price, and make the Picture fell. But now he's gone, ah! the sad Loss deplore! Great Millington, alas! he is no more. And you, the Muses Darling, to rehearse Your Sorrow for the Loss of him in Verse, Mourn, mourn together; for that Tyrant, Death, Has robb'd the famous Auctioneer of Breath. His Epitaph. Underneath this Marble Stone Lies the famous Millington: A Man who through the World did steer, I'th' station of an Auctioneer; A Man with wond'rous Sense and Wisdom blest whose Qualities are not to be exprest. On Mr. Prance's Hymn to the Pillory. I Now the Devil's old Agent, that brought to the Gallows, In the Empire of Swearing, a Leash of poor Fellows, With Eggs Aromatick, and Turnips assaulted, And in wooden Machine, like his Brethren exalted, Meets at last the Reward of his Swearing and Sinning; This, this of his Punishment, is the Beginning. II Huzza! How the Eggs and the Oranges fly! How the Witness they maul! How they darken the Sky! Huzza! The poor Silver-Smith tells a sad Ditty To all the compassionate Hearts of the City; While the Rabble does rail at the damnable Wretch, And bids him adjourn to the Hands of Squire Ketch. III Come, Boys, come again, the Encounter renew; Give perjur'd Prance and the Devil their Due; While the Markets and Stalls any Luggage afford, Keep on the Assault, let the Witness be stor'd: Let your Kindness ne'er cease, but distribute your Dole; Make his Body as nasty and vile as his Soul. The Character of a Puritan; written in the Reign of King William. A modern Saint! What is that monstrous Thing? Friend to Sedition, Flatterer of his King, Brother to Envy, subtle Satan's Son, Heir to those Ills his Serpent Sire begun; Without a Vizard, by his meagre Face, Within a Devil, varnish'd o'er with Grace; Dull, proud, imperious, ignorant, and grave, In Pow'r a Tyrant, when reduc'd, a Slave; An envious Hypocrite, that prays and whines At good Mens Welfare, more than for his Sins; Fond of Dissention, does the Church bely, And in distracting Tempests, soars most high; Uses Religion to disguise his Fraud, And serves himself thereby, but not his God; Prays loud, and often with a Conscience foul, More in regard to Int'rest than his Soul; A quaint Dissembler, who does pious seem, Not to gain Heav'n, but win the World's Esteem: In wicked Crimes the Zealot thrives a-pace, Like poys'nous Hemlock, o'er the wholesome Grass: And as he shoots, and makes the greater Show, Like nauseous Weeds, he does the ranker grow; Spreads and Impov'rishes his native Ground, And stints the nobler Herbs that fade around. A Nettle in the Soil, that sprouts too fast, And, deeply rooting, lays the Garden waste, O'er runs our fruitful Eden by Degrees, And drains the Sap from useful Plants and Trees. So hungry Ling each gen'rous Grain will choak, And Ivy, to its Ruin, hugs the Oak. But, O! that we cou'd see that pow'rful Hand, That plants so many Lawrels, weed our Land, Then might we hope, the peaceful Palm wou'd grow, And flourish, as Geneva Thorns do now; But since our lofty Pines must be remov'd, And worthless Thistles in their Room improv'd; Whilst such rank Weeds are cherish'd and manur'd, The Plagues we suffer must remain uncur'd. The Wonder of Wonders; or, a rich Vintner, and no Cuckold. Oh! Happy F?ck, thou alone art he, From jealous Stings and forked Antlers free; No am'rous Coxcombs clutter round thy Bar, To breathe their Passions in thy Help-mate's Ear; Or at thy Bride their squinting Glances throw; Whilst thou art mixing fatal Wines below, Such that with scorching Fevers fill our Veins, And with inebrious Fumes distract our Brains. The bouncing Partner of thy nuptial Joys, Who crowds thy Nurs'ry with such thumping Boys, Graces the Confines of her chaulky Throne, At least with two Cart-loads of Flesh and Bone; And seems, by her huge Sarazanick Face, To be deriv'd of old Tagenna's Race; Who was, if ancient Writers do not lye, Twelve Fathom thick, and seventy Cubits high. But thine's a Fairy to so tall a Dame, And cannot tow'r to such a lofty Fame; Yet none that ever view'd her, makes a Doubt, But that she's six Foot high, and twelve about; Yet sh'as such Charms in her gigantick Face, And moves with such an Elephant-like Grace, That were Antæus living, thou might'st dread A Rival then, that might adorn thy Head. But since Mankind to Pigmies are declin'd, And no such monstrous Men we now can find, Thou'rt safe from all the horned Plagues that wait On Love, and need not fear Acteon's Fate; For tho' thy Bride appears so fat and fine, She's far too big for any Arms but thine. What, tho' no Moon at full, with all her Light, Can shew a Countenance more large and bright; And that her snowy Breasts look big, and spread, Like two Peck Loaves of whitest Flour made; Yet who can tell but that which hidden lies, May prove by chance of a delightful Size, Since Greenland Sea-men from Experience note, That the huge Whale has but a narrow Throat: The mighty Monster, arm'd with Iv'ry Tooth, Tho' large his Limbs, has but a little Mouth. What, tho' her Belly looks as if she bore, Beneath her Clouts, a Sack of Malt before, To keep the spacious Centre of her Charms Beyond the lustful Reach of common Arms; For her Temptation, as she upright stands, Lies too remote by much, for human Hands; And from Assaults and Bobs is safe and free, 'Till Love's huge Pillars are disclos'd for thee. What, tho' her swelling Buttocks chafe behind, And like too Mill-stones, as she waddles, grind, It is a pleasing Sign she has no need Of artful Pillows in her Nuptial Bed; But that sh'as Flesh enough, when hugg'd at Night, To raise her Charms to a convenient Height. Therefore make much of thy gigantick Bride, For all the World believes she never try'd Love's tickling Joys with any Man beside. England's Triumph for their Conquest in Flanders, in the Year 1694, when the French took Namur, worsted us at Steenkirk, and General Talmash was kill'd at the Descent upon Breft. A Burlesque Poem. By Mr. Tho. Brown. When People find their Money spent, They recollect which Way it went, The like in order to prevent for future. That Money's spent, I need not tell, The French King's Tyranny to quell; I'm sure we must remember well, 'tis true, Sir. But least that we shou'd think it vain, Our English Feats I will proclaim, And what we did the last Campaign in Flanders. With Money flush'd, and Arms good store, We'd touch the French to 'th quick we swore, With that in Hast we hurry'd o'er Commanders. But scarce they'd set their Foot on Shore, But News was brought that Luxemburg Had actually besieg'd Namure, nigh Liege, Sir. This Action put 'em in Amaze, And yet if they shou'd make Delays, They thought they hardly e'er shou'd raise the Siege, Sir. With that they summon all their Force, Full fourscore thousand Foot and Horse, That never flinch, nor hang an Arse, when fighting. But yet all this did prove in vain, They not an Inch of Ground cou'd gain, There was such Storms of Thunder, Rain, and Light'ning. The Season bad did make 'em fret, Not that they fear'd the French a bit, But that it was so cursed wet, raw Weather. And raise the Siege they cou'd not do't, It was so dirty under Foot; The French were strong intrench'd to boot, together. On this they frequent Counsels call, In which they voted, one and all, That least the French shou'd chance to maul the Army, 'Twas better let the Town be taken, Provided they cou'd save their Bacon; The Weather too in Time might happen less stormy. Thus being, as you hear, distress'd, They think it now high Time to rest, And full two Months they took at least to do it. When thus refresh'd, then up they rose, And swore if none did them oppose, They'd be reveng'd, and make their Foes to rue it. Away they march, with full Intent To pay these French a Complement, And drub them to their Hearts content, but mark, Sir. The French their Coming understood, And therefore lin'd a little Wood, Where they their Party did make good 'till dark, Sir. These cunning Rogues had manag'd so, That we receiv'd another Blow, Which might have prov'd our overthrow, pray mind it. Here our poor English go to Pot, Because, forsooth, it is their Lot To undergo all Service hot, we find it. We had about seven thousand slain, But that is nothing in the main, Considering what we hope to gain next Battle. Then we'll recover all again, With one of ours we'll kill them ten, 'Till we have wasted all their Men, meer Rattle. But now tho' this Attempt did fail, We'd still a Trick that wou'd prevail, And make Monsieur his Stars bewail, with Sorrow. We had a Project under-hand, That soon wou'd make him understand, He must no longer keep the Land h' had borrow'd. This noble Whim to execute, A mighty Fleet was fitted out, And Talmash is the Man must do't, or no Man. Away he goes, with might and main, To try if he cou'd Footing gain, But there the gallant Man is slain, brave Roman. Namur we saw to France submit, At Steenkirk w'had enough of it, And the Descent did prove beshit all over. Our Conquest thus at length you view, And how the French we did subdue; Our Triumphs next I will to you discover. The Tower-Guns were all prepar'd, And Fire-works on Lighters rear'd; But what came on them, I ne'er heard a verbum. In Houses all Folks set up Lights, Only some sawcy Jacobites, Who were all put to mortal Frights, to curb 'em. First came the Guards to clear the Way, And next a 'Squire in Boots of Hay, Upon a Nag most miserably jaded. Masons and Bricklayers, with their Rules, Join with the other Rout of Fools, Who were to be the Party's Tools perswaded. Next these, in Droves the Rabble come, In one Hand Club, in t'other Stone, Those Windows that had Candles none, to batter. Last came a Coach, in which there sate Four Lords, who went, as People prate, The General to congratulate and flatter. But after all, it must be said, Our Conquest was not quite so bad, But they these Triumphs merited, and more, Sir. For never yet, as I presume, Was British Prince, or Emp'ror of Rome, With Farthing Candles lighted Home before, Sir. An Anacreontick. On a Lap-Dog. Nice, pretty Nice, thou Can'st not; but, ah! cou'd'st thou know How thou dost my Envy raise, And (because she loves thee) Praise; Thou wou'd'st not change for what is New, For Mexico, or for Peru. In that Lap, ah! Nice, rest, And think! Nice, think thou'rt blest; But if thou wilt thy Station change, And in another Precinct range, In Tap'stry, thou, or Silks, shalt lie, Under the richest Canopy; On Citron, Cedar, or on Gold, Or what thou dost most costly hold. If thou wilt but in Exchange thy Place resign, Let but thy Privilege be mine, This shall, and more than this, be thine. And, if I gain the Hope, I crave, Nice, I vow that thou shalt have An Epitaph upon thy Grave. A Letter from an old fornicating Vintner behind the Royal Exchange, to his Wine-Merchant in the Country, giving him an account of his intended Marriage. Written by Mr. Brown. The verse has been extracted from prose text. She's as black as a Sloe, And has something to show, So charming below, That my Fancy does glow, And does crow, As oft as I think of this heavenly Frow. But yet when I think This Damsel wants Chink, And that she will Drink; My Passion does sink, My M? does shrink, And all my Thoughts rove upon Mammon and Chink. A Farewell to Poor England. By Mr. Tho. Brown. In the Year 1704. Farewel false Friends, farewel ill Wine, Farewel all Women with Design, Farewel all pocky cheating Punks, Farewel Lotteries, farewel Banks: And, England, I, in leaving thee, May say, Farewel to Poverty. Adieu: Where'er I go, I am sure to find Nothing so ill as that I leave behind. Farewel Nation without Sense, Farewel Exchequer without Pence; Farewel Army with bare Feet, Farewel Navy without Meat; Farewel writing fighting Beauxs, And farewel useless Plenipoes. Adieu, &amp;c. Farewel you Good Old Cause Promoters, Farewel brib'd Artillery Voters; Farewel to all Attainting Bills, And Record which for Witness kills; Farewel to Laymens Villainy, And farewel Churchmens Perjury. Adieu, &amp;c. Instead of One King, Farewel Nine, And all who Associating sign. Farewel you gull'd unthinking Fops, Poor broken Merchants, empty Shops; Farewel pack'd Judges, cull'd for Blood, With eight Years War for England's Good. Adieu, &amp;c. Farewel you Judges, who dispense With perjur'd Cut-throat Evidence; Farewel thou haughty little Mouse, With those that choose thee for the House; Farewel Long ? and spightful Looks, With Reverend Oates, and all his Books. Adieu, &amp;c. Adieu once more: Britannia, fare thee well; And if all this won't mend thee, May the D? triumph in your Spoil, May Beggary run throughout your Isle, And no one think it worth his while To take up to defend thee.
