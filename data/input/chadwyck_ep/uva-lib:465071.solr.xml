      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. A POETICAL, SUPPLICATING, MODEST, AND AFFECTING EPISTLE TO THOSE LITERARY COLOSSUSES THE REVIEWERS. Carmine, Dî Superi placantur, carmine, Manes. Vast are the pow'rs of verse—indeed so strong, Angels and devils can be sooth'd by song. Fathers of wisdom, a poor wight befriend! Oh, hear my simple prayer in simple lays: In formâ pauperis behold I bend, And of your worships ask a little praise. I am no cormorant for fame, d'ye see; I ask not all the laurel, but a sprig! Then hear me, guardians of the sacred tree, And stick a leaf or two about my wig. In sonnet, ode, and legendary tale, Soon will the press my tuneful works display; Then do not damn 'em, and prevent the sale; And your petitioner shall ever pray. My labours damn'd, the Muse with grief will groan— The censure dire my lantern jaws will rue! Know, I have teeth and stomach like your own, And that I wish to eat as well as you. I never said, like murderers in their dens, You secret met in cloud-capp'd garret high, With hatchets, scalping knives in shape of pens, To bid, like Mohocks, hapless authors die: Nor said (in your Reviews, together strung) The limbs of butcher'd writers, cheek by jowl, Look'd like the legs of flies on cobwebs hung Before the hungry spider's dreary hole. I ne'er declar'd, that, frightful as the Blacks, In greasy flannel caps you met together, With scarce a rag of shirt about your backs, Or coat or breeches to keep out the weather. Heav'n knows I'm innocent of all transgression Against your honours, men of classic fame! I ne'er abus'd your critical profession, Whose dictum saves at once or damns a name. I never question'd your profound of head, Nor vulgar, call'd your wit, your manners coarse; Nor swore on butcher'd authors that you fed, Like carrion crows upon a poor dead horse. I never said, that, pedlar like, you sold, Praise by the ounce, or pound, like snuff or cheese; Too well I knew you silver scorn'd and gold— Such dross, a sage Reviewer seldom sees! I never hinted, that with half a crown Books have been sent you by the scribbling tribe; Which fee hath purchas'd pages of renown: No, for I knew you'd spurn the paltry bribe. I ne'er averr'd, you critics to a man, For pence, would swear an owl excell'd the lark; Nor call'd a coward gang, your grave Divan, That stabb'd, like base assassins in the dark. I never prais'd, or blam'd, an author's book, Until your wise opinions came abroad; On these with holy rev'rence did I look: With you I prais'd, or blam'd, so help me G?d! The fam'd Longinus all the world must know: The gape of wonder Aristarchus drew, As well as Alexander's tutor Aristotle., lo! All! all great critics, gentlemen, like you. Did any ask me, ‘Pray, sir, your opinion Of those Reviewers, who so bold bestride The world of learning, and, with proud dominion, High on the backs of crouching authors ride?’ Quick have I answer'd, in a rage, ‘Odsblood! No works like theirs such criticism convey: Not all the timber of Dodona's wood E'er pour'd more sterling oracle than they.’ Did others cry, ‘Whate'er their brains indite, Be sure, is excellent—a partial crew! With Iö Paæns usher'd to the light, And prais'd to folly in the next Review:’ This was my answer to each snarling elf (My eye-balls fill'd with fire, my mouth with foam), ‘Zounds! is not justice due to one's dear self? And should not charity begin at home? ‘Full often I've been question'd with a sneer— Think you one could not bribe 'em?’—‘Not a nation.’ ‘A beef-stake, with a pot or two of beer, Might save a little volume from damnation.’. Furious I've answer'd, ‘Lo! my Lord Carlisle Hath begg'd, in vain, a seat in Fame's old temple; Though you applaud, their wisdoms will not smile; And what they disapprove is cursed simple. ‘Could gold succeed, enough the peer might raise, Whose wealth would buy the critics o'er and o'er: 'Tis merit only can command their praise, Witness the volumes of Miss Hannah More A lady talked of for her rhimes, and emphatically called, by a certain class of readers, the tenth Muse.; ‘The Search for Happiness, that beauteous song, Which all of us would give our ears to own; The Captive, Percy A pair of tragedies., that, like mustard strong, Make our eyes weep, and understandings groan.’ Hail Bristol town! Bœotia now no more, Since Garrick's Sappho sings, though rather slowly, All hail Miss Hannah! worth at least a score, Ay, twenty score, of Chatterton and Rowley. Men of prodigious parts are mostly shy: Great Newton's self this failing did inherit; Thus, frequent, you avoid the public eye, And hide, in lurking holes, a world of merit. Yet oft your cautious modesties I see, When from your bow'r with bats you wing the dark: And Sundays, when no catchpoles prowl for prey, On æther dining in St. James's Park. Meek sirs! in frays you choose not to appear, A circumstance most natural to suppose, And therefore, hide your precious heads, for fear Some angry bard abus'd should pull your nose. The world's loud plaudit, lo! you don't desire, Nor do you hastily on books decide; But first at ev'ry coffee-house inquire, How, in its favour, runs the public tide. There, Wisdom, often with a critic wig, The face demure, knit brows, and forehead scowling, I've seen o'er pamphlets, with importance big, Mousing for faults, or, if you'll have it, owling. Herculean gentlemen! I dread your drubs; Pity the lifted whites of both my eyes! Strung with new strength beneath your massy clubs, Alas! I shall not an Antæus rise. Lo, like an elephant along the ground, Great Caliban, the giant Johnson stretch'd! The British Roscius too your clubs confound, Whose fame the farthest of the stars hath reach'd. If such so easy sink beneath your might, Ye gods! I may be done for in a trice: Hurl'd by your rage to everlasting night— Crack'd with that ease a beggar cracks his lice. If, awful sirs, you grant me my petition; With brother pamphlets shall my pamphlet shine; And should it chance to pass a first edition, In capitals shall stare your praise divine. Quote from my work as much as e'er you please; For extracts, lo! I'll put no angry face on; Nor fill a hungry lawyer's fist with fees, To trounce a bookseller, like furious Mason The contest between Mr. Mason and a bookseller is generally known.. Sage sirs! if favour in your sight I find, If fame you grant, I'll bless each gen'rous giver; Wish you sound coats, good stomachs, masters kind The booksellers., Gallons of broth, and pounds of bullock's liver. ['Tis hard, Messieurs Reviewers, 'pon my soul] The following Address to the Reviewers was written for a poetical Friend, who had suffered by their Severity. 'Tis hard, Messieurs Reviewers, 'pon my soul, You thus should lord it o'er the world of wit: No higher court your sentence to control, You hang, or you reprieve, as you think fit! Whether, in calf, your labours of the year Rank with immortal bards, or boxes line; Or, torn for secret services, oh dear! Are offer'd up at Cloacina's shrine; Whether you look all rosy round the gills, Or hatchet-fac'd like starving cats so lean; Whether your criticism each pocket fills With halfpence, keeping you close shav'd and clean: Whether in gorgeous raiment you appear, Or tatters ready from your backs to fall; Whether with pompous wigs to guard each ear, Or whether you've no wigs or ears at all: Whether you look like gentlemen or thieves, I hate usurpers of the critic throne; Therefore his compliments the poet gives, And humbly hopes you'll let his lines alone. Stay till he asks your thoughts, ye forward sages; Officiousness the modest bard abjures: 'Tis surely pert to meddle with his pages, Who never deign'd to look in one of yours. LYRIC ODES TO THE ROYAL ACADEMICIANS, FOR MDCCLXXXII. By PETER PINDAR, ESQ. A DISTANT RELATION OF THE POET OF THEBES, And Laureat to the Academy. ? Arma virosque cano. Paint and the men of canvass fire my lays, Who show their works for profit and for praise; Whose pockets know most comfortable fillings— Gaining Two Thousand Pounds a year by Shillings. ODE I. Peter giveth an Account of his great Relation— boasteth—praiseth Sir William Chambers and Somerset-House—applaudeth Sir Joshua Reynolds, and showeth deep classic Learning. My cousin Pindar, in his odes, Applauded horsejockeys and gods, Wrestlers and boxers in his verse divine! Then shall not I, who boast his fire, And old hereditary lyre, To British painters give a golden line? Say, shall yon dome stupendous rise, Striking with attic front the skies— The nursing dame of many a painting ape Painting Ape.—This expression is by no means meant to convey the idea of insult. There is great propriety, if not poetry, in it. The reader will please to recollect, that painting is an imitative art— Monkeys are prodigious imitators—witness my own Odes. Besides, Pope compliments the immortal Newton by a similar allusion.; And I immortal rhime refuse, To tell the nations round the news, And make posterity with wonder gape? Spirit of cousin Pindar, ho! By all thy odes, the world shall know, That Chambers plann'd it—be his name rever'd!— Sir William's journeymen and tools (No pupils of the Chinese schools), With stone, and wood, and lime, the fabric rear'd! Thus having put the knight in rhime, Stone, men, and timber, tools and lime; Now let us see what this rare dome contains— Where rival artists for a name, Bit by that glorious mad-dog Fame, Have fix'd the labours of their brush and brains. O Muse! Sir Joshua's master-hand Shall first our lyric laud command— Lo! Tarleton dragging on his boot so tight! His horses feel a godlike rage, And long with Yankies to engage— I think I hear them snorting for the fight. Behold with fire each eye-ball glowing! I wish, indeed, their manes so flowing Were more like hair—the brutes had been as good, If, flaming with such classic force, They had resembled less that horse, Call'd Trojan—and, by Greeks compos'd of wood. Now to yon angel let us go— A fine performance, too, I trow, Who rides a cloud—indeed a poorish hack— Which to my mind doth certes bring That easy bum-delighting thing, Rid by the Chancellor—yclep'd a sack. Yet, Reynolds, let me fairly say, With pride I pour the lyric lay To most things by thy able hand exprest— Compar'd, alas! to other men, Thou art an eagle to a wren! Now, Mrs. Muse, attend on Mr. West. ODE II. Peter falleth foul on Mr. West for representing our blessed Redeemer like an Old-clothes-man— and for misrepresenting the Apostles.—Peter describeth St. Paul, and Judas and the Apostles —Cutteth up Mr. West's Angels—Attacketh another Picture of Mr. West's—Weepeth over the hard Fate of Prince Octavius and Augustus, Children of our Most Glorious Sovereign. O West, what hath thy pencil done; Why, painted God Almighty's Son Like an old-clothes-man, about London street! Place in his hand a rusty bag, To hold each sweet collected rag; We then shall see the character complete. Th' Apostles too, I'm much afraid, Were not the fellows thou hast made— For Heav'n's sake, West, pray rub them out again— There's not a mortal who believes They look'd like old Salvator's Salvator Rosa, happy in his characters of banditti. thieves, Although they might not look like gentlemen. St. Paul most candidly declares, He could not give himself high airs Upon his person, which was rather homely: But really, as for all the rest, Save Judas, who was a rank beast, They all were decent labourers, and comely. Thy spirits too can't boast the graces; Two Indian angels by their faces: But speak—where are their wings to mount the wind? One would suppose M'Bride Capt. M'Bride, famous for winging men of war, as well as partridges.—See his letter to the Admiralty. had met 'em; If thou hast spare ones, quickly get 'em, Or else the lads will both be left behind. Ghost of Octavius! tell the bard, And thou, Augustus, us'd so hard, Why West hath murder'd you, my tender lambs? You bring to mind vile Richard's deed, Who bid your royal cousins bleed, For which the world the tyrant's mem'ry damns. West, I must own thou dost inherit Some portion of the plainting spirit; But trust me—not extraordinary things— Some merit thou must surely own, By getting up so near the throne, And gaining whispers from the best of kings. ODE III. Peter administereth sage Advice to very young Painters. People must mount by slow degrees to glory; 'Tis stairs must lead us to the attic story— Thus thought my great old name-sake, Peter Czar; Who bound himself, in Holland, to a trade; A very pretty carpenter he made; And then went home To Russia., and built a man of war. The lad who would a 'pothecary shine, Should powder claws of crabs, and jalap, fine; Keep the shop clean, and watch it like a porter; Learn to boil glysters—nay, to give them too, If blinking nurses can't the bus'ness do; Write well the labels, and wipe well the mortar. Before that boys can rise to master-tanners, Humble those boys must be, and mind their manners; Despising pride, whose wish it is to wreck 'em; And mornings, with a bucket and a stick, Should never once disdain to pick, From street to street, rich lumps of album græcum. Thus should young limning lads themselves demean; Learn how to keep their master's brushes clean, And learn to squeeze the colours from the bladders; Furbish up rags—the shining pallet set; Keep the knives bright, and eke the easel neat— Such arts, to Fame's high temple are the ladders. Young men—so useful are the arts I mention (Believe me, not an atom is invention). The instant that I pen this Ode, I know A Jew-like, shock-poll'd, scrubby, short, black man, More like a cobbler than a gentleman, Working on canvass, like a dog in dough. By Heav'ns! with scarce more knowledges than these, He earns a guinea ev'ry day with ease; Attempteth heads of princes, dogs, cats, 'squires— Now on a monkey vent'reth—now a saint— Talks of himself, and much himself admires And struts the veriest Bantam-cock of paint. But mind me, youths, I don't conceit advise, Because 'tis fulsome to men's ears and eyes; Whose tongues might cover you with ridicule; And pray, who loves the appellation, Fool? Yet, if in spite of all the Muse can say, You will insist on going the wrong way, And wish to be a laughing-stock— Copy our little old black Bantam cock— Whose soul, moreover, of such sort is— With so much acrimony overflows, As makes him, wheresoe'er he goes, A walking thumb-bottle of aqua-fortis. ODE IV. The Lyric Bard commendeth Mr. Gainsborough's Pig—Recommendeth Landscape to the Artist. And now, O Muse, with song so big, Turn round to Gainsb'rough's Girl and Pig, Or Pig and Girl I rather should have said: The pig in white, I must allow, Is really a well painted Sow: I wish to say the same thing of the maid. As for poor St. Leger and Prince, Had I their places I should wince, Thus to be gibbeted for weeks on high: Just like your felons after death, On Bagshot, or on Hounslow Heath, That force from travellers the pitying sigh. Yet Gainsb'rough has great merit too, Would he his charming fort pursue— To mind his Landscape have the modest grace— Yet there, sometimes, are nature's tints despis'd: I wish them more attended to, and priz'd, Instead of trump'ry that usurps their place. ODE V. Peter quarrelleth with Fat—Proveth its fatal Inconveniences —Accounteth for the Leanness and Rags of the Muses—Displayeth Military Science—Telleth a wonderful Story of a Spanish Marquis—Talketh sensibly of a Greyhound, a Hawk, and a Race-horse—Pointeth out the proper Subjects for Grease. Painters and Poets never should be sat— Sons of Apollo! listen well to that. Fat is foul weather—dims the fancy's sight: In poverty, the wits more nimbly muster: Thus stars, when pinch'd by frost, cast keener lustre On the black blanket of old mother night. Your heavy fat, I will maintain, Is perfect birdlime of the brain; And, as to goldfinches the birdlime clings— Fat holds ideas by the legs and wings. Fat flattens the most brilliant thoughts, Like the buff-stop on harpsichords, or spinets— Muffling their pretty little tuneful throats, That would have chirp'd away like linnets. Not only fat is hurtful to the arts, But Love, at fat—ev'n Love almighty starts— Love hates large, lubberly, fat, clumsy fellows, Panting and blowing like a blacksmith's bellows. In Parliament, amidst the various chat, What eloquence of North's is lost by fat! Mute in his head-piece on his bosom hung, How many a speech has slept upon his tongue. So far Apollo's right, I needs must own, To keep his sons and daughters high in bone: The Nine too, as from history we glean, Are, like Don Quixote's Rosinante, lean; Who likewise fancy all incumbrance bad, And therefore travel very thinly clad; Looking like damsels just escap'd from jails, With backs al fresco, and with tatter'd tails. How, with large rolls of fat, would act A soldier, or a sailor? And 'tis a well-attested fact, Apollo was as nimble as a tailor. How could he else have caught that handsome flirt, Miss Daphne, racing through the pools and dirt? The Marquis of Cerona, of great parts, Could scarce support himself, he was so big; He starv'd—drank vinegar by pints and quarts, And got down to a Christian—from a pig. Some author says, his skin (but some will doubt him) Would fold a half-a-dozen times about him. Reader!—of lie I urge not an iöta: His skin would really round his body come, Though tight before as parchment on a drum— Just like a Portuguese capota. Yes, yes—indeed, I solemnly repeat, Painters and bards should very little eat: No matter, verily, how slight their fare; Nay, though camelion-like, they fed on air. Else they're like ladies much inclin'd to feeding— Who, often when they fatten, leave off breeding; Or, like the hen, facetious Æsop's story, So known, I shall not lay the tale before ye. You would not load with fat a running-horse, Or greyhound you design'd to course; Nor would you fatten up the hawk, You mean to nimble birds to talk. Then pray, young brushmen, if you wish to thrive, And keep your genius, and the art alive, Gobble not quantities of flesh and fish up: Beings who can no harm from fat receive, May feast securely—then for Heaven's sake leave Grease to an alderman, a hog, or bishop. ODE VI. Peter flattereth Mr. Mason Chamberlin—and that most brilliant Landscape Painter, Mr. Loutherbourgh —Peter admireth, praiseth, and consoleth the English Claude, Wilson. Thy portraits, Chamberlin, may be A likeness, far as I can see; But, faith! I cannot praise a single feature: Yet, when it so shall please the Lord, To make his people out of board, Thy pictures will be tolerable nature. And Loutherbourgh, when Heav'n so wills To make brass skies, and golden hills, With marble bullocks in glass pastures grazing; Thy reputation too will rise, And people, gaping with surprise, Cry, ‘Monsieur Loutherbourgh is most amazing!’ But thou must wait for that event; Perhaps the change is never meant— Till then, with me, thy pencil will not shine: Till then, old red-nos'd Wilson's art Will hold its empire o'er my heart, By Britain left in poverty to pine. But, honest Wilson, never mind; Immortal praises thou shalt find, And for a dinner have no cause to fear. Thou start'st at my prophetic rhimes: Don't be impatient for those times; Wait till thou hast been dead a hundred year. ODE VII. Peter breaketh out into Learning, and talketh Latin—Adviseth young Artists to do no more than they can do—Recommendeth to each the Knowledge of his Genius.—Peter talketh of Æsop's Fables, and Mr. Stubbs.—Peter ventureth on the Stage—Recordeth a Story of an Actor, and concludeth facetiously. Qui fit, Mæcenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem,’ Was partly written for those fools Who slight the very art that would support 'em, In spite of gratitude's and wisdom's rules. It brings to mind old Æsop's tale, so sweet, Of a poor country-bumkin of a stag, Who us'd to curse his clumsy legs and feet, But of his horns did wonderfully brag: Unlike our London poor John-Bulls, Who, from the wardrobe of their sculls, Could, with the greatest pleasure, piece-meal tear, Such pretty-looking ornamental geer. But, to the story of the buck, Like many English ones, much out of luck. When to a thicket master buck was chas'd, His fav'rite horns contriv'd to spoil his trot, By keeping the young 'squire in limbo fast, Till John the huntsman came and cut his throat. Unfortunately for the graphic art, Painters too often their true genius thwart; Mad to accomplish what can ne'er be done, They form for criticism a world of fun. The man of hist'ry longs to deal in little, Quits lasting oil, for perishable spittle: The man of miniature to history springs, Mounts with an ardour wild the broom-like brush, Makes for sublimity a daring push, And shows, like Icarus, his feeble wings. 'Tis said that nought so much the temper rubs Of that ingenious artist, Mr. Stubbs, As calling him a horse-painter—how strange, That Stubbs the title should desire to change! Yet doth he curses on th' occasion utter, And, foolish, quarrel with his bread and butter: Yet, after landscape, gentlemen and ladies, This very Mr. Stubbs prodigious mad is: So quits his horse—on which the man might ride To Fame's fair temple, happy and unhurt; And takes a hobby-horse to gall his pride, That flings him, like a lubber, in the dirt. The self-same folly reigns, too, on the stage, Such for impossibilities the rage! The man of Farce, to Tragedy aspires, And, calf-like bellowing, feels heroic fires.— Weston for Hamlet and Othello sigh'd, And thought it dev'lish hard to be denied. The courtly Abington's untoward star Wanted her reputation much to mar, And sink the lady to the washing-tub— So whisper'd—‘Mrs. Abington, play Scrub.’ To folly full as great, some imp may lug her, And bid her slink in Filch, and Abel Drugger. An actor, living at this time That now I pen my verse sublime, Could not, to save his soul, find out his fort; But lo! it happen'd, on a lucky night, He on the subject got a deal of light; And thus doth Fame the circumstance report. After exhibiting to pit and boxes, To take a dram, the actor stroll'd to Fox's; A tavern near the playhouse. Where soon his friend came in, such fine things saying, Offering a thousand pretty salutations, With full confirming oath-ejaculations, Unto this son of Thespis, for his playing. ‘By Heav'ns!’ quoth he, ‘unrivall'd is thy merit— Thou playd'st to-night, my friend, with matchless spirit; Zounds! my dear fellow, let me go to h?ll, If ever part was acted half so well!’ The actor blush'd, and bow'd, and silly look'd, To hear such compliments so nicely cook'd: Getting the better of his mauvaise honte, And staring at the other's steady front. He ask'd—‘What part, pray, mean ye? for, in troth, I know of none that you should so commend’— ‘What part!’ replied the other with an oath: ‘The hind-part of a jack-ass, A part in one of the pantomimes, which contains a large portion of kicking, braying, obstinacy, and tail-wriggling. my dear friend!’ The player, pleas'd instead of being hurt, Thank'd him for the discovery of his fort: Pursu'd his genius—sought no higher game, And by his jack-ass won unenvied fame. ODE VIII. Peter abuseth Mr. and Mrs. Cosway. Fie, Cosway! I'm asham'd to say Thou own'st the title of R. A.— I fear, to damn thee 'twas the Devil's sending; Some honest calling quickly find, And bid thy wife her kitchen mind, Or shirts and shifts be making, or be mending. If madam cannot make a shirt, Or mend, or from it wash the dirt, Better than paint—the poet for thee feels— Or take a stitch up in thy stocking (Which for a wife is very shocking), I pity the condition of thy heels. What vanity was in your skulls, To make you act so like two fools, T'expose your daubs, tho' made with wondrous pains out? Could Raphael's angry ghost arise, And on the figures cast his eyes, He'd catch a pistol up, and blow your brains out. Muse, in this criticism, I fear, Thou really hast been too severe: Cosway paints miniature with truth and spirit, And Mrs. Cosway boasts a fund of merit. Be more like courtly Horace's thy page; And shun of furious Juvenal the rage, Of whom old Scaliger asserts—‘qui jugulat:— Id est—the fellow would not murder boggle at. This Scaliger employs, too, the word trucidat: That is, the bard would dash through thick and thin, And, like a ruffian, would so use ye, that He would not leave a whole bone in your skin. ODE IX. Peter exhibiteth Bible Knowledge—Condemneth Imitators, and maketh Comparisons. Sir Joshua—for I've read my Bible over— Of whose fine art I own myself a lover, Puts me in mind of Matthew, the first chapter— Abrâm got Isaac—Isaac, Jacob got— Joseph to get, was lucky Jacob's lot, And all his brothers, Who very nat'rally made others, Continuing to the end of a long chapter— A genealogy I read with rapture. Yet, possibly, not with so much delight, As Queensb'ry's duke, delighting in good courses, Reads (which I'm told he doth, from morn to night) The noble pedigrees of running-horses, Penn'd with a deal of subtlety and labour, By that great turf-apostle, Mr. Heber. Sir Joshua's happy pencil hath produc'd A host of copyists, much of the same feature; By which the art hath greatly been abus'd— I own Sir Joshua great—but nature greater. But what, alas! is ten-times worse The progress of the art to curse, The copyists have been copied too, And that, I'm sure, will never do. Such painters are like pointers hunting game, Intent on pleasure, and dog-fame; Suppose a half-a-dozen dogs, or more, Snuffing, and scamp'ring, crossing the field o'er. One pointer scents the partridge—points— Fix'd like a statue on the pleasing gale! How act the others?—Stop their scamp'ring joints; And, lo! one's nose is on his neighbour's tail. Perhaps this dog-comparison of mine, Though vastly natural and vastly fine, May not be fully understood By all the youngling painter brood; Therefore, that into error they mayn't roam, I think I'll be a little more at home. Suppose a damsel of the Cyprian class, A fresh-imported, lovely, blooming lass, Gay, careless, smiling, ogling, in the park— Suppose those charms, so pleasing to the eye, Catch the wild glance, and start the am'rous sigh, Of some young roving military spark! Lo! as if touch'd by bailiffs, or by thunder, Sudden he stops—all-over staring wonder— A thousand fancies his warm brain surround, And nail'd, as if by magic, to the ground, He points towards those fascinating charms That rous'd the host of passions up in arms. A brother ensign spies the stock-still lad, And sudden halts—grave pond'ring what it means— Another ensign, taking this for mad, Upon his supple-jack, deep-marv'ling, leans: Another ensign after him, too, sauntering, Stops short, and to his eye applies his glass; To know what stay'd his brother ensign's cantering, Not dreaming of that eye-catcher, the lass. Thus nosing one the other's back, Stands in a goodly row the king's red pack: Except the first, whom Nature's charms in flame, His nose is properly towards the game. E'en so, the President, to Nature true, Doth mark her form, and all her haunts pursue; Whilst half the silly brushmen of the land, Contented take the nymph at second-hand; Imps, who just boast the merit of translators— Horace's servum pecus—imitators. ODE X. Peter jeereth Messieurs Serres and Zoffani, and condemneth Mr. Barret. Serres and Zoffani! I ween, I better works than yours have seen; You'll say, no compliment can well be colder: Why, as you scarce are in your prime, And wait the strength'ning hand of time, I hope that you'll improve as you grow older. The first is about 70 years of age, and the last 63 or 64. Believe me, Barret, thou hast truth and taste; Yet sometimes art thou apt to be unchaste: Too oft thy pencil, or thy genius flags— Too oft thy landscapes, bonfires seem to be; And in thy bustling clouds, methinks I see The resurrection of old rags. O Catton, our poor feelings spare! Suppress thy trash another year; Nor of thy folly make us say a hard thing— And lo! those daubs amongst the many, Painted by Mr. Edward Penny! They truly are not worth a half a farthing. ODE XI. Peter cannonadeth Fashion—Adviseth People to use their own Eyes and Noses; and ordereth what is to be done with a bad Nose. One year the pow'rs of fashion rule In favour of the Roman school; Then hey, for drawing! Raphael and Poussin. The following year, the Flemish schools shall strike; Then hey, for col'ring—Rubens and Vandyke; And, lo! the Roman is not worth a pin. Be not impos'd upon by Fashion's roar— Fashion too often makes a monstrous noise, Bids us, a fickle jade, like fools adore The poorest trash, the meanest toys. And as a gang of thieves a bustle make, With greater ease your purse to take, So Fashion frequently, her point to gain, Sets up a howl enough to stun a stone, And fairly picks the pocket of your brain, That is, if any brain you chance to own. Carry your eyes with you, where-e'er you go— For not to trust to them, is t'abuse 'em; As Nature gave them t'ye, you ought to know The wise old lady meant that you should use 'em; And yet, what thousands, to our vast surprise, Of pictures judge by other people's eyes! When Nature made a present of a nose To each man's face, we justly may suppose She meant, that for itself the nose should think, And judge in matters of perfume and stink; Not meant it for a mule alone, poor hack! To bear horn spectacles upon its back— ‘Suppose it cannot smell, what then?’ you'll say. Fling it away. ODE XII. The Lyric Bard groweth witty on Mr. Peters's Angel and Child—and Madam Angelica Kauffman. Dear Peters! who like Luke the saint, A man of Gospel art, and paint, Thy pencil flames not with poetic fury: If Heav'n's fair angels are like thine, Our bucks, I think, O grave divine, May meet in t'other world the nymphs of Drury. The infant soul I do not much admire: It boasteth somewhat more of flesh than fire. The picture, Peters, cannot much adorn ye— I'm glad though, that the red-fac'd little sinner, Poor soul! hath made a hearty dinner, Before it ventur'd on so long a journey. Angelica my plaudit gains— Her art so sweetly canvass stains! Her dames so Grecian! give me such delight! But, were she married to such gentle males As figure in her painted tales, I fear she'd find a stupid wedding-night. ODE XIII. Peter lasheth the Ladies—He turneth Story-teller. Peter grieveth. Although the ladies with such beauty blaze, They very frequently my passion raise— Their charms compensate, scarce, their want of taste. Passing amidst the Exhibition crowd, I heard some damsels fashionably loud; And thus I give the dialogue that pass'd. ‘Oh! the dear man!’ cried one, ‘look! here's a bonnet! He shall paint me—I am determin'd on it— Lord! cousin, see! how beautiful the gown! What charming colours! here's fine lace, here's gauze! What pretty sprigs the fellow draws! Lord, cousin! he's the cleverest man in town!’ ‘Ay, cousin,’ cried a second, ‘very true— And here, here's charming green, and red, and blue! There's a complexion beats the rouge of Warren! See those red lips, oh la! they seem so nice! What rosy cheeks then, cousin to entice!— Compar'd to this, all other heads are carrion. Cousin, this limner quickly will be seen, Painting the Princess Royal, and the Queen: Pray, don't you think as I do, Coz? But we'll be painted first, that's poz.’ Such was the very pretty conversation That pass'd between the pretty misses, Whilst unobserv'd the glory of our nation, Close by them hung Sir Joshua's matchless pieces. Works! that a Titian's hand could form alone— Works! that a Reubens had been proud to own. Permit me, ladies, now to lay before ye What lately happen'd—therefore a true story. A STORY. Walking one afternoon along the Strand, My wond'ring eyes did suddenly expand Upon a pretty leash of country lasses. ‘Heav'ns! my dear beauteous angels, how d'ye do? Upon my soul I'm monstrous glad to see ye.’ ‘Swinge! Peter, we are glad to meet with you; We're just to London come—well, pray how be ye? We're just a going, while 'tis light, To see St. Paul's before 'tis dark. Lord! come, for once, be so polite, And condescend to be our spark.’ ‘With all my heart, my angels.’—On we walk'd, And much of London—much of Cornwall talk'd. Now did I hug myself to think How much that glorious structure would surprise; How from its awful grandeur they would shrink With open mouths, and marv'ling eyes! As near to Ludgate-Hill we drew, St. Paul's just opening on our view, Behold, my lovely strangers, one and all, Gave, all at once, a diabolic squawl, As if they had been tumbled on the stones, And some confounded cart had crush'd their bones. After well fright'ning people with their cries, And sticking to a ribbon-shop their eyes, They all rush'd in, with sounds enough to stun And clattering all together, thus begun:— ‘Swinge! here are colours then, to please! Delightful things, I vow to Heav'n! Why! not to see such things as these, We never should have been forgiv'n. Here, here, are clever things—good Lord! And, sister, here, upon my word— Here, here!—look! here are beauties to delight: Why! how a body's heels might dance Along from Launceston to Penzance, Before that one might meet with such a sight!’ ‘Come, ladies, 'twill be dark,’ cried I—‘I fear: Pray let us view St. Paul's, it is so near.’— ‘Lord! Peter,’ cried the girls, ‘don't mind St. Paul! Sure! you're a most incurious soul— Why—we can see the church another day; Don't be afraid—St. Paul's can't run away.’ Reader, If e'er thy bosom felt a thought sublime, Drop tears of pity with the man of rhime! ODE XIV. Peter disclaimeth Flattery—Describeth the Grand Monarque—and promiseth critical Candour. 'Tis very true, that flattery's not my fort— I cannot to stupidity pay court— And swear a face looks sense (the picture puffing) That boasts no more expression than a muffin. And yet, a Frenchman can do this, And think he doth not act amiss; Although he tells a most confounded lie. King Lewis leads me into this remark, Call'd by his people all, le grand Monarque; A demi-god in every Frenchman's eye. His portrait by some famous hand was done, And then exhibited at the Salon— At once a courtly critic criticises— ‘Where is the brilliant eye, the charming grace, The sense profound that marks the royal face; The soul of Lewis, that so very wise is?’ Yet when he bawl'd for sense, he bawl'd, I wot, For furniture the head had never got. Reader, believe me that this gentleman Was form'd on nature's very homely plan.— Clumsy in legs and shoulders, head and gullet, His mouth abroad in seeming wonder lost, As if its meaning had given up the ghost: His eye far duller than a leaden bullet; Nature so slighting the poor royal nob, As if she bargain'd for it by the job. Therefore, should mighty G?, or great Lord North, Both gentlefolks of high condition, Think it worth while to send their faces forth, To stare amidst the Royal Exhibition— If likenesses, I'll not condemn the pictures, To compliment those mighty people's polls: I scorn to pass unfair, and cruel strictures, By asking for the graces, or their souls. ODE XV. Peter praiseth Mr. Stubbs, and administereth wholesome Advice—Surpriseth Mr. Hone with a Compliment—Concludeth with suspecting the Ingratitude of the Royal Academicians. Well-pleas'd thy horses, Stubbs, I view, And eke thy dogs, to nature true: Let modern artists match thee if they can; Such animals thy genius suit— Then stick, I beg thee, to the brute, And meddle not with woman, nor with man. And now for Mr. Nathan Hone— In portrait thou'rt as much alone, As in his landscape stands th' unrival'd Claude— Of pictures I have seen enough, Most vile, most execrable stuff! But none so bad as thine, I vow to God. Thus in the cause of painting loyal, Sublime I've sung to artists royal— With labour-pains the Muse hath sore been torn! And yet each academic face, I fear me, hath not got the grace To smile upon the bantling, now 'tis born. MORE LYRIC ODES TO THE ROYAL ACADEMICIANS. Ecce iterum Crispinus. ODE I. Peter puffeth away—Displayeth his Learning— Praiseth the Reviewers—Describeth himself most pathetically—Consoleth himself—Disliketh the Road to the Temple of Fame by Means of a Pistol, Poison, or a Rope—Addresseth great Folks—Giveth the King a broad Hint— Asketh a queer Question—Maketh as queer an Apostrophe to Genius. Sons of the brush, I'm here again! At times a Pindar, and Fontaine, Casting poetic pearl (I fear) to swine! For hang me if my last year's odes Paid rent for lodgings near the gods, The attic story, or, according to the vulgar phrase, garret. Or put one sprat into this mouth divine. For odes, my cousin had rump-steaks to eat! So says Pausanias—loads of dainty meat! And this the towns of Greece, to give, thought fit: The best historians, one and all, declare, With the most solemn air, The poet might have guttled till he split. How different far, alas! my worship's fate! To sooth the horrors of an empty plate, The grave possessors of the critic throne, See the Reviews for last year. Gave me, in truth, a pretty treat— Of flattery, mind me, not of meat; For they, poor souls, like me, are skin and bone. No, no! with all my lyric pow'rs, I'm not like Mrs. Cosway's Hours, A sublime picture this! the expression is truly Homerical. The fair artist hath, in the most surprising manner, communicated to canvass the old bard's idea of the brandy-fac'd hours.—See the Iliad. Red as cock-turkeys, plump as barn-door chicken: Merit and I are miserably off: We both have got a most consumptive cough; Hunger hath long our harmless bones been picking. Merit and I, so innocent, so good, Are like the little children in the wood— And soon, like them, shall lay us down and die? May some good Christian bard, in pity strong, Turn redbreast kind, and with the sweetest song Bewail our hapless fate with wat'ry eye! Poor Chatterton was starv'd—with all his art! Some consolation this to my lean heart— Like him, in holes too, spider-like, I mope; And there my rev'rence may remain, alas! The world will not discover it, the ass! Until I scrape acquaintance with a rope. Then up your Walpoles, Bryants, mount like bees; Then each my pow'rs with adoration sees— Nothing their kind civilities can hinder— When, like an Otho, I am found; Like Jacob's sons, they'll look one t'other round, And cry, ‘Who would have thought this a young Pindar?’ Hanging's a dismal road to fame— Pistols and poison just the same— And what is worse, one can't come back again— Soon as the beauteous gem we find, We can't display it to mankind, Tho' won with such wry mouths and wriggling pain. Ye lords and dukes so clever, say (For you have much to give away, And much your gentle patronage I lack), Speak, is it not a crying sin, That Folly's guts are to his chin, Whilst mine are slunk a mile into my back? Oft as his sacred Majesty I see, Ah! George (I sigh) thou hast good things with thee, Would make me sportive as a youthful cat; It is not that my soul so loyal Would wish to wed the Princess Royal, Or be archbishop—no! I'm not for that. Nor really have I got the grace To wish for laureat Whitehead's place; Whose odes Cibberian—sweet, yet very manly, Are set with equal strength by Mr. Stanley. Would not one swear that Heav'n lov'd fools, There's such a number of them made; Bum-proof to all the flogging of the schools, No ray of knowledge could their skulls pervade? Yet, take a peep into those fellows' breeches, We stare like congers, to observe their riches. O Genius; what a wretch art thou, Thou canst not keep a mare nor cow, With all thy compliment of wit so frisky! Whilst Folly, as a mill-horse blind, Beside his compter, gold can find, And Sundays sport a strumpet and a whisky! ODE II. Peter beginneth to criticise—Addresseth the British Raphael—Promiseth Mr. West great things, and like great Folks breaks his Word—Laugheth at the Figure of King Charles—Lasheth that of Oliver Cromwell; and ridiculeth the Picture of Peter and John galloping to the Sepulchre— Understandeth plain-work, and justly condemneth the Shortness of the Shirts of Mr. West's Angels—Concludeth with making that Artist a handsome Offer of an American Immortality. Now for my criticism on paints, Where bull-dogs, heroes, sinners, saints, Flames, thunder, lightning, in confusion meet!— Behold the works of Mr. West!— That artist first shall be addrest— His pencil with due reverence I greet— Still bleeding from his last year's wound, Which from my doughty lance he found; Methinks I hear the trembling painter bawl, ‘Why dost thou persecute me, Saul?’ West, let me whisper in thy ear— Snug as a thief within a mill, From me thou hast no cause to fear, To panegyric will I turn my skill; And if thy picture I am forc'd to blame, I'll say most handsome things about the frame. Don't be cast down—instead of gall, Molasses from my pen shall fall: And yet, I fear thy gullet it is such, That could I pour all Niagara down, Were Niagara praise, thou wouldst not frown. Nor think the thund'ring gulf one drop too much. Ye gods! the portrait of the King! A very Saracen! a glorious thing! It shows a flaming pencil, let me tell ye— Methinks I see the people stare, And, anxious for his life, declare, ‘King George hath got a fireship in his belly.’ Thy Charles!—what must I say to that? Each face unmeaning, and so flat!— Indeed, first cousin to a piece of board— But, Muse, we've promis'd in our lays, To give our Yankey painter praise; So, madam, 'tis but fair to keep your word. Well then, the Charles of Mr. West, And Oliver, I do protest, And eke the witnesses of resurrection Peter and John.; Will stop a hole, keep out the wind, And make a properer window-blind, Than great Correggio's, us'd for horse-protection Correggio's best pictures were actually made use of in the royal stables in the North, to keep the wind from the tails of the horses.. They'll make good floor-cloths, tailors' measures, For table coverings, be treasures, With butchers, form for flies most charming flappers; And Monday mornings at the tub, When queens of suds their linen scrub, Make for the blue-nos'd nymphs delightful wrappers. West, I forgot last year to say, Thy Angels did my delicacy hurt; Their linen so much coarseness did display: What's worse, each had not above half a shirt. I tell thee, cambric fine as webs of spiders, Ought to have deck'd that brace of heavenly riders. Could not their saddle-bags, pray, jump To something longer for each rump? I'd buy much better at a Wapping shop, By vulgar tongues baptiz'd a slop! Do mind, my friend, thy hits another time, And thou shalt cut a figure in my rhime. Sublimely tow'ring 'midst th' Atlantic roar, I'll waft thy praises to thy native shore America.; Where Liberty's brave sons their pœans sing, And every scoundrel convict is a king. ODE III. The Poet addresseth Mr. Gainsborough—Exhibiteth great Scripture Erudition—Condemneth Mr. Gainsborough's Plagiarism—Giveth the Artist wholesome Advice—Praiseth the Cornish Boy; and sayeth fine things to Jackson. Now, Gainsborough, let me view thy shining labours, Who, mounted on thy painting throne, On other brushmen look'st contemptuous down, Like our great admirals on a gang of swabbers. My eyes broad-staring wonder leads To yon dear nest of royal heads A frame full of heads, in most humble imitation of the royal family.! How each the soul of my attention pulls! Suppose, my friend, thou giv'st the frame A pretty little Bible name, And call'st it Golgotha, the place of skulls? Say, didst thou really paint 'em? (to be free) An angel finish'd Luke's transcendent line— Perchance that civil angel was with thee— For let me perish if I think them thine. Thy dogs A picture of boys setting dogs to fight. are good!—but yet, to make thee stare, The piece hath gain'd a number of deriders— They tell thee, Genius in it had no share, But that thou foully stol'st the curs from Snyders. I do not blame thy borrowing a hint, For, to be plain, there's nothing in't— The man who scorns to do it, is a log: An eye, an ear, a tail, a nose, Were modesty, one might suppose; But, z?ds! thou must not smuggle the whole dog. O Gainsborough! Nature 'plaineth sore, That thou hast kick'd her out of door, Who in her bounteous gifts hath been so free, To cull such genius out for thee— Lo! all thy efforts without her are vain! Go find her, kiss her, and be friends again. Speak, Muse, who form'd that matchless head, The Cornish Boy Opie., in tin mines bred; Whose native genius, like his diamonds, shone In secret, till chance gave him to the sun? 'Tis Jackson's portrait—put the laurel on it, Whilst to that tuneful swan I pour a sonnet. SONNET, TO JACKSON, OF EXETER. Enchanting harmonist! the art is thine, Unmatch'd, to pour the soul-dissolving air That seems poor weeping Virtue's hymn divine, Soothing the wounded bosom of despair! O say, what minstrel of the sky hath given To swell the dirge, so musically lorn? Declare, hath dove-ey'd Pity left her heaven, And lent thy happy hand her lyre to mourn? So sad—thy songs of hopeless hearts complain, Love, from his Cyprian isle, prepares to fly; He hastes to listen to thy tender strain, And learn from thee to breathe a sweeter sigh. ODE IV. The great Peter, by a bold Pindaric Jump, leapeth from Sonnet to Gull-catching. Reader, dost know the mode of catching gulls? If not, I will inform thee—Take a board, And place a fish upon it for the fools— A sprat, or any fish by gulls ador'd: Those birds, who love a lofty flight, And sometimes bid the sun good night; Spying the glittering bait that floats below; Sans céremonie, down they rush (For gulls have got no manners), on they push; And what's the pretty consequence, I trow? They strike their gentle jobbernowls of lead Plump on the board—then lie like boobies dead. Reader, thou need'st not beat thy brains about, To make so plain an application out— There's many a painting puppy, take my word, Who knocks his silly head against a board— That might have help'd the state—made a good jailor, A nightman, or a tolerable tailor. ODE V. Peter discovereth more scriptural Erudition— Groweth sarcastic on the Exhibition—Giveth a wonderful Account of St. Dennis—Blusheth for the Honour of his Country—Talketh sensibly of the Duc de Chartres and the French King. ‘Find me in Sodom out,’ (exclaim'd the Lord) ‘Ten gentlemen, the place sha'n't be untown'd— That is, I will not burn it ev'ry board:’ The dev'l a gentleman was to be found! But this was rather hard, since Heav'n well knew That every fellow in it was a Jew. This house is nearly in the same condition— Scarce are good things amid those wide abodes— Find me ten pictures in this Exhibition, That ought not to be d?n'd, I'll burn my Odes! And then the world will be in fits and vapours, Just as it was for poor Lord Mansfield's papers To the irreparable loss of the public, and that great law expounder, burnt! burnt in Lord George Gordon's religious conflagration.—The newspapers howled for months over their ashes.—Ohe jam satis est.. St. Dennis, when his jowl was taken off, Hugg'd it, and kiss'd it—carried it a mile— This was a pleasant miracle enough, That maketh many an unbeliever smile. ‘'Sblood! 'tis a lie!’ you roar—Pray do not swear, You may believe the wondrous tale indeed! Speak, hav'n't you said that many a picture here Was really done by folks without a head? And hav'n't you sworn this instant, with surprise, That he who did that thing, had neither hands nor eyes? How is it that such miserable stuff The walls of this stupendous building stains? The council's ears with pleasure I could cuff; Mind me—I don't say, batter out their brains. What will Duke Chartres say when he goes home And tells King Lewis all about the room? Why, viewing such a set of red-hot heads, Our Exhibition he will liken Hell to; Then to the Monarch, who both writes and reads Give hand-bills of the wonderous Katterfelto. Swearing th' Academy was all so flat, He'd rather see the wizard and his cat. ODE VI. The British Peter elegantly and happily depicteth his great Cousin of Thebes—Talketh of Fame —Horsewhippeth the Painters for turning their own Trumpeters. A Desultory way of writing, A hop and step and jump mode of inditing, My great and wise relation Pindar, boasted: Or (for I love the bard to flatter) By jerks, like boar-pigs making water, Whatever first came in his sconce, Bounce, out it flew, like bottled ale, at once, A cock, a bull, a whale, a soldier roasted. What sharks we mortals are for fame! How poacher-like we hunt the game! No matter, for it, how we play the fool— And yet, 'tis pleasing our own laud to hear, And really very natural to prefer One grain of praise to pounds of ridicule. I've lost all patience with the trade— I mean the painters—who can't stay To see their works by criticism display'd And hear what others have to say; But calling Fame a vile old lazy strumpet, Sound their own praise from their own penny trumpet. At the beginning of the Exhibition, the public papers swarmed with those self-adulators. Amidst the hurly-burly of my brain, Where the mad Lyric muse, with pain Hammering hard verse her skill employs, And beats a tinman's shop in noise; Catching wild tropes and similies, That hop about like swarms of fleas— We've lost Sir Joshua—Ah! that charming elf, I'm griev'd to say, hath this year lost himself. Oh! Richard, thy St. George See Mr. Cosway's picture of Prudence, Wisdom, and Valour arming St. George. so brave, Wisdom and Prudence could not save From being foully murder'd, my good friend; Some weep to see the woful figure; Whilst others laugh, and many snigger, As if their mirth would never have an end. Prithee accept th' advice I give with sorrow— Of poor St. George the useless armour borrow To guard thy own poor corpse—don't be a mule— Take it—e'en now thou'rt like a hedgehog, quill'd (Richard, I hope in God thou art not kill'd) By the dire shafts of merc'less ridicule. Pity it is! 'tis true 'tis pity! As Shakspeare lamentably says, That thou, in this observing city, Thus runn'st a wh?r?ng after PRAISE: With strong desires I really think thee fraught; But, Dick, the nymph, so coy, will not be caught. Yet, for thy consolation, mind! In this thy wounded pride may refuge find— Think of the sage who wanted a fine piece: Who went, in vain, five hundred miles at least, On Laïs, a sweet fille de joie, to feast— The Mrs. Robinson of Greece. Prithee give up, and save the paints and oil, And don't whole acres of good canvass spoil: Thou'lt say, ‘Lord! many hundreds do like me.’ Lord! so have fellows robb'd—nay, further, Hundreds of villains have committed murther; But, Richard, are these precedents for thee? ODE VII. Peter groweth ironically facetious. Nature's a coarse, vile, daubing jade— I've said it often, and repeat it— She doth not understand her trade— Artists, ne'er mind her work, I hope you'll beat it. Look now, for Heav'n's sake, at her skies! What are they?—Smoke, for certainty, I know; From chimney-tops, behold! they rise, Made by some sweating cooks below. Look at her dirt in lanes, from whence it comes— From hogs, and ducks, and geese, and horses' bums. Then tell me, decency, I must request, Who'd copy such a dev'lish nasty beast? Paint by the yard—your canvass spread, Broad as the main-sail of a man of war— Your whale shall eat up ev'ry other head, Ev'n as the sun licks up each sneaking star! I do assure you, bulk is no bad trick— By bulky things both men and maids are taken— Mind, too, to lay the paints like the mortar thick, And make your picture look as red as bacon. All folks love size; believe my rhime; Burke says, 'tis part of the sublime. A Dutchman, I forget his name—Van Grout, Van Slabberchops, Van Stink, Van Swab,— No matter, though I cannot make it out— At calling names I never was a dab: This Dutchman, then, a man of taste, Holding a cheese that weigh'd a hundred pound, Thus, like a Burgomaster, spoke with judgment vast ‘No poet like my broder step de ground: He be de bestest poet, look! Dat all de world must please; For he heb vrite von book, So big as all dis cheese!’ If at a distance you would paint a pig, Make out each single bristle on his back: Or if your meaner subject be a wig, Let not the caxon a distinctness lack; Else, all the lady critics will so stare, And, angry vow, ‘'Tis not a bit like hair!’ Be smooth as glass—like Denner finish high; Then every tongue commends— For people judge not only by the eye, But feel your merit by their finger ends: Nay! closely nosing, o'er the picture dwell, As if to try the goodness by the smell. Claude's distances are too confus'd— One floating scene—nothing made out— For which he ought to be abus'd, Whose works have been so cry'd about. Give me the pencil, whose amazing style Makes a bird's beak appear at twenty mile; And to my view, eyes, legs, and claws will bring, With ev'ry feather of his tail and wing. Make all your trees alike, for nature's wild— Fond of variety, a wayward child— To blame your taste some blockheads may presume; But mind that every one be like a broom. Of steel and purest silver form your waters, And make your clouds like rocks and alligators. Whene'er you paint the moon, if you are willing To gain applause—why paint her like a shilling: Or Sol's bright orb—be sure to make him glow Precisely like a guinea or a jo. A Portugal coin, vulgarly called a Johannes. In short, to get your pictures prais'd and sold Convert, like Midas, every thing to gold. I see, at excellence, you'll come at last— Your clouds are made of very brilliant stuff; The blue on China mugs are now surpass'd, Your sun-sets yield not to brick walls, nor buff. In stumps of trees your art so finely thrives, They really look like golden-hafted knives! Go on, my lads—leave Nature's dismal hue, And she, ere long, will come and copy you. ODE VIII. The sublime Peter concludeth in a Sweat. Thus have I finish'd, for this time, My odes, a little wild and rambling— May people bite like gudgeons at my rhime! I long to see them scrambling— Then very soon I'll give 'em more (God willing) But this is full sufficient for a shilling. For such a trifle, such a heap! Indeed I sell my goods too cheap. ‘Finish'd!’ a disappointed artist cries, With open mouth, and straining eyes; Gaping for praise, like a young crow for meat— ‘Lord! why you have not mentioned me?’ Mention thee! Thy impudence hath put me in a sweat— What rage for fame attends both great and small! Better be d??n'd, than mention'd not at all! LYRIC ODES, FOR MDCCLXXXV. ? Ridentem dicere verum Quid vetat? ? HORAT. ODE I. The divine Peter giveth an Account of a Conference he held last Year with Satire, who advised him to attack some of the R. A.'s, to tear Mr. West's Works to Pieces, abuse Mr. Gainsborough, fall foul of Mrs. Cosway's Sampson, and give a gentle Stroke on the Back of Mr. Rigaud—The Poet's gentle answer to Satire—The Ode of Remonstrance that Peter received on Account of his Lyrics—Satire's Reply—Peter's Resolution. ‘Not, not this year the lyric Peter sings— The great R. A.'s have wish'd my song to cease; I will not pluck a feather from your wings— So, sons of canvass! take your naps in peace.’ Such was my last year's gracious speech, Sweet as the King's to Commons and to Peers, Always with sense and tropes as plum-cake rich, A luscious banquet for his people's ears! ‘Not write!’ cried Satire, red as fire with rage, ‘This instant glorious war with dulness wage; Take, take my supple-jack, Play St. Bartholomew with many a back! Flay half the academic imps alive! Smoke, smoke the drones of that stupendous hive. Begin with George's idol, West;— And then proceed in order with the rest: This moment knock me down his master Moses, Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai. On Sinai's mountain, where his nose is Cock'd up so pertly plump against the Lord, Upon my word, With all that ease to him who rules above, As if that Heaven and he were hand and glove.’ ‘Indeed,’ quoth I, ‘the piece hath points of merit, Though not possess'd throughout of equal spirit.’ ‘What!’ answer'd Satire, ‘not knock Moses down! O stupid Peter! what the devil mean ye? He looks a dapper barber of the town, With paper sign-board out—“Shave for a penny.” Observe the saucy Israelite once more— Wears he the countenance that should adore? No! 'tis a son of lather—a rank prig; Who, 'stead of begging of the Lord the Law, With sober looks, and reverential awe, Seems pertly tripping up to fetch his wig. With all her thunder bid the Muse Fall furious on the group of Jews, Whose shoulders are adorn'd with Christian faces; For by each phiz (I speak without a gibe), There's not an Israelite in all the tribe— Not that they are encumber'd by the Graces. Strike off the head of Jeremiah, A picture by Mr. West. And break the bones of old Isaiah; Another picture by West. Down with the duck-wing'd angels, In the Apotheosis, a picture by West. that abreast Stretch from a thing call'd cloud, and, by their looks, Wear more the visage of young rooks Cawing for victuals from their nest. Deal Gainsborough a lash, for pride so stiff, Who robs us of such pleasure for a miff; Whose pencil, when he chooses, can be chaste, Give nature's form, and please the eye of taste. Of cuts on Sampson A picture by Mrs. Cosway. don't be sparing, Between two garden-rollers staring, Shown by the lovely Dalilah foul play! To atoms tear that Frenchman's Rigaud. trash, Then bountifully deal the lash On such as dar'd to dub him an R. A.’ Thus Satire to the gentle poet cry'd— And thus with lamb-like sweetness I reply'd:— ‘Dear Satire! pray consult my life and ease; Were I to write whatever you desire, The fat would all be fairly in the fire— R. A.'s surround me like a swarm of bees, Or like a flock of small birds round a fowl Of solemn speculation, call'd an Owl.’ Quoth I, ‘O Satire, I'm a simple youth, Must make my fortune, therefore not speak truth, Although as sterling as the Holy Bible— Truth makes it (Mansfield says) the more a libel: I shall not sleep in peace within my hutch; Like Doctor Johnson The story goes, that Sam, before his political conversion, replied to his present Majesty, in the Library at Buckingham-House, on being asked by the Monarch, why he did not write more?— ‘Please your Majesty, I have written too much.’ So candid a declaration, of which the sturdy moralist did not believe one syllable, procured him pension and a muzzle., I have wrote too much.’ When Mount Vesuvius See Sir William Hamilton's account. pour'd his flames, And frighten'd all the Naples' dames, What did the ladies of the city do? Why, order'd a fat Cardinal to go With good St. Januarius's head, And shake it at the Mountain 'midst his riot To try to keep the bully quiet: The parson went, and shook the jowl, and sped; Snug was the word—the flames at once kept house, The fright'ned Mount grew mute as any mouse. Thus, should Lord Mansfield from his bench agree To shake his lion-mane-like wig at me, And bid his grim-look'd myrmidons assail— With heads Medusan, and with hearts of bone; Who, if they did not turn me into stone, Might turn my limbs, so gentle, into jail. Read, read this ode, just come to hand, Giving the Muse to understand That cruelty and scandal swell her song, And that 'twere better far she held her tongue. TO PETER PINDAR, ESQ. A thousand frogs, upon a summer's day, Were sporting 'midst the sunny ray, In a large pool, reflecting ev'ry face;— They show'd their gold-lac'd clothes with pride, In harmless sallies, frequent vied, And gambol'd through the water with a grace. It happen'd that a band of boys, Observant of their harmless joys, Thoughtless, resolv'd to spoil their happy sport; One phrensy seiz'd both great and small, On the poor frogs the rogues began to fall, Meaning to splash them, not to do them hurt. Lo, as old authors sing, ‘the stones 'gan pour,’ Indeed an Otaheite show'r: The consequence was dreadful, let me tell ye; One's eye was beat out of his head, This limp'd away, that lay for dead— Here mourn'd a broken back, and there a belly. Amongst the smitten, it was found, Their beauteous queen receiv'd a wound; The blow gave ev'ry heart a sigh, And drew a tear from ev'ry eye:— At length King Croak got up, and thus begun— ‘My lads, you think this very pretty fun! Your pebbles round us fly as thick as hops,— Have warmly complimented all our chops;— To you I guess that these are pleasant stones! And so they might be to us frogs, You damn'd, young, good-for-nothing dogs, But that they are so hard, they break our bones.’ Peter! thou mark'st the meaning of this fable— So put thy Pegasus into the stable; Nor wanton thus with cruel pride, Mad, Jehu-like, o'er harmless people ride. To drop the metaphor—the fair Mrs. Cosway., Whose works thy Muse forbore to spare, Is blest with talents Envy must approve; And didst thou know her heart, thou sure wouldst say, ‘Perdition catch the cruel lay!’ Then strike the lyre to Innocence and Love. ‘Poh, poh!’ cried Satire, with a smile, ‘Where is the glorious freedom of our isle, If not permitted to call names?’ Methought the argument had weight— ‘Satire,’ quoth I, ‘you're very right’— So once more forth volcanic Peter flames! ODE II. The Poet correcteth the Muse's Warmth, who beginneth with little less than calling names— Hinteth at some academic Giants—And concludeth with a Pair of apt and elegant Similies. ‘Tagrags and bobtails of the sacred brush!’— For Heaven's sake, Muse, be prudent:— Hush! hush! hush! The great R. A.'s, so jealous of their fame, Will all declare, of them we make a game; And then, the Lord have mercy on our skins! Think what a formidable phalanx, Muse, Strengthen'd by Messieurs Garvay, and Rigaud, and Co. How dangerous such a body to abuse! Then there's among the academic crew, A MAN Mr. Barry. that made the President look blue; Brandish'd his weapon—with a whirlwind's forces, Tore by the roots his flourishing discourses; And swore his own sweet Irish howl could pour A half a dozen such in half an hour. Be prudent, Muse!—once more I pray— In vain I preach! th' advice is thrown away: Ev'n now you turn your nose up with a sneer, And cry—Lord! Reynolds has no cause to fear: When Barry dares the President to fly on, 'Tis like a mouse, that, work'd into a rage, Daring most dreadful war to wage, Nibbles the tail of the Nemæan lion. Or like a louse, of mettle full, Nurs'd in some giant's skull— Because Goliath scratch'd him as he fed, Employs with vehemence his angry claws, And gaping, grinning, formidable jaws, To carry off the giant's head! ODE III. The Poet addresseth Sir William Chambers, a Gentleman of Consequence in the Election of R. A.'s—He accuseth the Knight of a partial and ridiculous Distribution of the academic Honours—Threateneth him with Rhime— Adviseth a Reformation. One minute, gentle irony, retire— Behold! I'm graver than a mustard-pot; The Muse, with bile as hot as fire, Could call fool, puppy, blockhead, and what not; As brother Horace has it—tumet jecur:— Nor in her angry progress will I check her. I'm told, that Satan has been long at work To bring the Academy into disgrace; Oh! may that member's b?ck??de feel his fork, Who dares to violate the sacred place! Who dares the Devil join In so nefarious a design? Yet, lo! what dolts the honours claim! I leave their works to tell their name. Th' Academy is like a microscope— For, by the magnifying power, are seen Objects, that for attention ne'er could hope; No more, alas! than if they ne'er had been. So rare a building, and so grac'd With monuments of ancient taste, Statues and busts, relievos and intaglios; For such poor things to watch the treasure, Is laughable beyond all measure— 'Tis just like eunuchs put to guard seraglios. Think not, Sir William, I'm in jest— By Heaven! I will not let thee rest: Yet thou mayst bluster like bull-beef so big; And of thy own importance full, Exclaim, ‘Great cry, and little wool!’ As Satan holla'd, when he shav'd the pig. Yes, thou shalt feel my tomahawk of satire, And find that scalping is a serious matter: Shock'd at th' abuse, how rage inflames my veins! Who can help swearing, when such wights he sees Crept to th' Academy by ways and means, Like mites and skippers in a Cheshire cheese? What beings will the next year's choice disclose, The academic list to grace? Some skeletons of art, I do suppose, That ought to blush to show their face. Sir William! tremble at the Muse's tongue; Parnassus boasts a formidable throng! All people recollect poor Marsyas' fate, Save such as are dead, drunk, or fast asleep: Apollo tied the culprit to a gate, And flay'd him as a butcher flays a sheep: And why?—Lord! not as history rehearses, Because he scorn'd his piping, but his verses: In vain, like a poor pillory'd punk, he bawl'd, And kick'd and writh'd, and said his pray'rs, and sprawl'd; 'Twas all in vain—the God pursu'd his sport, And pull'd his hide off—as you'd pull your shirt! Then bid not rage the Muse's soul inflame, Whose thund'ring voice damnation makes or fame. You'll ask me, p'rhaps, ‘Good master Peter, pray What right have you to speak?’—then pertly smile. I'll tell you, sir—My pocket help'd to pay For building that expensive pile, A pile that credit to the nation gains, And does small honour to your worship's brains. It made a tax on candles and shoe-leather, Of monstrous use in dirty weather: It also made a tax on butchers' shops, So spread its influence o'er poetic chops; A most alarming tax to ev'ry poet, Whose poor lank greyhound ribs with sorrow show it. Therefore, Sir Knight, pray mend your manners: And don't choose cobblers, blacksmiths, tinkers, tanners: Some people love the converse of low folks, To gain broad grins for good-for-nothing jokes— Though thou, 'midst dulness, mayst be pleas'd to shine, Reynolds shall ne'er sit cheek-by-jowl with swine. ODE IV. The Poet again payeth his Respects to Sir William Chambers—Complaineth of his Illiberality in his Choice of R.A.'s—Adviseth him to keep Company with Prudence, whom he describeth most naturally—He threateneth the Knight—And concludeth with a beautiful Simile. The Muse is in the fidgets—can't sit still— She must have t'other talk with you, Sir Will. Since her last ode, with sorrow hath she heard You want not men with heavenly genius blest, But wish the title of R. A. conferr'd On such as catch the bugs, and sweep the spiders best, Wash of the larger statues best, the faces, And clean the dirty linen of the Graces; Scour best the skins of the young marble brats, Trap mice, and clear th' Academy from rats. You look for men whose heads are rather tubbish, Or, drum-like, better form'd for sound than sense; Pleas'd with the fine Arabian to dispense, You want the big-bon'd drayhorse for your rubbish. Raise not the Muse's anger, I desire; High-born, she's hotter than the lightning's fire, And proud! (believe the poet's word) Proud as the lady of a new-made lord; Proud as, in all her gorgeous trappings drest, Fat Lady Mayoress at a city feast; Whose spouse makes wigs, or some such glorious thing, Shoes, gloves, hats, nightcaps, breeches, for the King. Prudence, Sir William, is a jewel— Is clothes, and meat, and drink, and fuel! Prudence! for man the very best of wives, Whom Bards have seldom met with in their lives; Which, certés, doth account for, in some measure, Their grievous want of worldly treasure, On which the greatest blockheads make their brags; And showeth why we see, instead of lace, About the poet's back, with little grace, Those fluttering, French-like followers, call'd rags. Prudence! a sweet, obliging, curtseying lass, Fit through this hypocritic world to pass! Who kept at first a little peddling shop, Swept her own room, twirl'd her own mop, Wash'd her own smocks, caught her own fleas, And rose to fame and fortune by degrees; Who, when she enter'd other people's houses, Till spoke to, was as silent as a mouse is; And of opinions, though possess'd a store, She left them with her pattens—at the door. Sir William, you're a hound! and hunting Fame;— Undoubtedly the woman is fair game: But, Nimrod, mind—my Muse is whipper-in! So that, if ever you disgrace, By turning cur, your noble race, The Lord have mercy on your curship's skin! ODE V. The Poet openeth his Account of the Exhibitors at the Academy—Praiseth Reynolds—Half damneth Mr. West—Completely damneth Mr. Wright of Derby—Complimenteth Mr. Opie. Muse, sing the wonders of the present year: Declare what works of sterling worth appear. Reynolds, his heads divine, as usual, gives, Where Guido's, Rubens', Titian's genius lives! Works! I'm afraid, like beauty of rare quality, Born soon to fade!—too subject too mortality! West most judiciously my counsel takes, Paints by the acre—witness parson Peter Peter preaching, by West.: For garbs, he very pretty blankets makes, Deserving praises in the sweetest metre. The flesh of Peter's audience is not good— Too much like ivory, and stone, and wood; Nor of the figures dare I praise th' expression, With some folks thought a trifle of transgression. West, your Last Supper is a hungry piece; Your Tyburn saints will not your fame increase: With looks so thievish, with such skins of copper! Were they for sale, as Heaven's my judge, To give five farthings for them I should grudge, Nay, ev'n my old tobacco-stopper. Candour must own, that frequently thy paints Have play'd the Devil with the Saints; For me! I fancy them like doves and throstles! But thou, if we believe thy art, Enough to make us pious Christians start, Hast very scurvy notions of Apostles. What of thy landscape A most pitiable performance indeed. It may be fairly called the dotage of the art. shall I say, Holding the old white sow, and sucking litter? Curs'd be the moment, curs'd the day, Thou gav'st the Muse such reason to be bitter! But, Muse, be soft towards him—only sigh, ‘More damned stuff was never seen by eye.’ Thou really dost not equal Derby Wright A painter of moon-lights. In this new edition of the Odes, it is but just to acknowledge, that the author has seen some landscapes of a late date, by this artist, that do him great credit., The man of night! O'er woollen hills, where gold and silver moons Now mount like sixpences, and now balloons; Where sea-reflections, nothing nat'ral tell ye, So much like fiddle-strings, or vermicelli— Where ev'ry thing exclaimeth, how severe! ‘What are we?’ and ‘what bus'ness have we here?’ ODE VI. The Poet addresseth Majesty—Pleadeth the Cause of poor, starving Poetry—He acknowledgeth in a former Ode the Kindnesses of Fame, yet throweth out a Hint to his Majesty that his Finances may be improved—He relateth a marvellous Story of a Jesuit—Recommendeth something similar to his Sovereign. An't please your Majesty, I'm overjoy'd To find your family so fond of painting; I wish her sister Poetry employ'd— Poor, dear neglected girl! with hunger fainting. Your royal grandsire (trust me, I'm no fibber) Was vastly fond of Colley Cibber. For subjects, how his Majesty would hunt? And if a battle grac'd the Rhine or Weser, He'd cry—‘Mine poet sal mak Ode upon't!’ Then forth there came a flaming Ode to Cæsar. Dread sire, pray recollect a bit Some glorious action of your life; And then your humble poet's wit, Sharp as a razor, or a new-ground knife, Shall mount you on her glorious balloon odes, Like Rome's great Cæsar, to th' immortal Gods Divisum imperium, cum Jove, Cæsar habet.. A Naples' Jesuit, history declares, On slips of paper scribbled prayers, Which show'd of wisdom great profundity; Then sold them to the country folks, To give their turkeys, hens, and ducks, To bring increase of fowl-fecundity: It answer'd.—On their turkeys, ducks, and hens, The country people all were full of brags— Whose little bums, in barns, and mows, and fens, Squat down, and laid like conjuration bags. I wish this sage experiment were try'd On me, cries Muse, my gentle bride; And slips of paper giv'n me, with this pray'r— ‘Pay to the bearer fifty pounds at sight.’ My sweet prolific pow'rs 'twould so delight! I'd breed like a tame rabbit or a hare! Muse, give thine idle supplication o'er— And know that avarice is always poor ODE VII. Peter's Account of wonderful Reliques in France, with the Devotion paid to them—The sensible Application to Painters and Painting, by way of Simile. In France, some years ago—some twenty-three, At a fam'd church, where hundreds daily jostle, I wisely paid a priest six sols to see The thumb of Thomas the Apostle. Gaping upon Tom's thumb, with me in wonder, The rabble rais'd its eyes—like ducks in thunder; Because in virtues it was vastly rich, Had cur'd possess'd of devils, and the itch; Work'd various wonders on a scabby pate— Made little sucking children straight, Though crook'd like rams' horns by the rickets; Made people see, though blind as moles— And made your sad, hysteric souls, As gay as grasshoppers and crickets; Brought noses back again to faces, Long stol'n by Venus and her Graces; And eyes to fill their parent sockets, Of which sad Love had pick'd their pockets: And had the priest permitted, with their kisses, The mob had smack'd this holy thumb to pieces. Though, reader, 'twas not the Apostle's thumb— But mum!— It play'd as well of miracles the trick, Although a painted piece of rotten stick! For six sols more, behold! to view, was bolted A feather of the angel Gabriel's wing! Whether 'twas pluck'd by force, or calmly molted, No holy legends tell, nor poets sing. But was it Gabriel's feather, heav'nly Muses? It was not Gabriel's feather, but a goose's! But stay! from truth we would not wish to wander, For, probably, the owner was a gander. Painters! you take me right:—the Muse supposes You make your coup-de-maître dashes, Christen them eyes, and cheeks, and lips, and noses, Beards, chins, and whiskers, and eye-lashes; As like, p'rhaps, as a horse is like a plum, Or 'foresaid stick, St. Tom th' Apostle's thumb. With purer eyes the British vulgar sees; We are no crawthumpers, no devotees; So that, whene'er your figures are mere wood, Our eyes will never deem 'em flesh and blood. ODE VIII. The generous Peter rescueth the immortal Raphael from the Obloquy of Michael Angelo— The Poet moralizeth—Telleth a Story not to the Credit of Michael Angelo, and nobly defendeth Raphael's Name against his invidious Attack —Concludeth with a most sage Observation. How difficult in artists to allow To brother brushmen ev'n a grain of merit! Wishing to tear the laurels from their brow, They show a sniv'ling, diabolic spirit. So 'tis! however moralists may chatter— What's worse still—nature will be always nature We can't brew Burgundy from sour small beer, Nor make a silken purse of a sow's ear. Sweet is the voice of Praise!—from eve to morn From blushing morn to darkling eve again, My Muse the brows of Merit could adorn, And, lark-like, swell the panegyric strain. Praise, like the balm which evening's dewy star Sheds on the drooping herb and fainting flower, Lifts modest, pining Merit from despair, And gives her clouded eye a golden hour, P?x take me if I ever read the story Of Michael Angelo, without much swearing: 'Tis such a slice cut off from Michael's glory, He surely had been brandying it or beering: That is, in plainer English, he was drunk, And candour from the man with horror shrunk. Raphael did honour to the Roman school, Yet Michael did vouchsafe to call him fool; When working in the Vatican, would stare, Throw down his brush, and stamp and swear, If e'er a porter let him in—he'd stone him; And, if he Raphael caught, most surely bone him. He swore the world was a rank ass To pay a compliment to Raphael's stuff; For that he knew the fellow well enough, And that his paltry metal would not pass. Such was the language of this false Italian: One time he christen'd Raphael a Pygmalion, Swore that his madams were compos'd of stone; Swore his expressions were like owls so tame, His drawings, like the lamest cripple, lame; That, as for composition, he had none. Young artists! these assertions I deny;— 'Twas vile ill manners—not to say a lie: Raphael did real excellence inherit; And if you ever chance to paint as well, I bona fide do foretel, You'll certainly be men of merit. ODE IX. The gossiping Peter telleth a strange Story, and true, though strange—Seemeth to entertain no very elevated Opinions of the Wisdom of Kings—Hinteth at the narrow Escape of Sir Joshua Reynolds—Mr. Ramsay's Riches—A Recommendation of Flattery as a Specific in Fortune-making. I'm told, and I believe the story, That a fam'd Queen of Northern brutes, A gentlewoman of prodigious glory, Whom ev'ry sort of epithet well suits; Whose husband dear, just happening to provoke her, Was shov'd to Heaven upon a red-hot poker! Sent to a certain King, not King of France— Desiring by Sir Joshua's hand his phiz— What did the royal quiz? Why, damn'd genteelly, sat to Mr. Dance! The true reason that induced his Majesty to sit to Mr. Dance, was laudable royal economy. Mr. Dance charged fifty pounds for the picture—Sir Joshua Reynolds's price was somewhat more than a hundred—a very great difference in the market-price of paint and canvass; and, let me say, that justified the preference given to the man who worked cheapest. Then sent it to the Northern Queen— As sweet a bit of wood as e'er was seen! And therefore most unlike the princely head— He might as well have sent a pig of lead. Down ev'ry throat the piece was cramm'd As done by Reynolds, and deserv'dly damn'd; For as to Master Dance's art It ne'er was worth a single—! Reader, I blush!—am delicate this time! So let thy impudence supply the rhime. Thank God! that monarchs cannot taste control, And make each subject's poor, submissive soul Admire the work that judgment oft cries fie on: Had things been so, poor Reynolds we had seen Painting a barber's pole—an ale-house queen, The Cat and Gridiron, or the Old Red Lion! At Plympton, Sir Joshua's native spot, in Devonshire. p'rhaps, for some grave Doctor Slop, Painting the pots and bottles of the shop: Or in the Drama, to get meat to munch, His brush divine had pictur'd scenes for Punch! Whilst West was whelping 'midst his paints, Moses and Aaron, and all sorts of saints! Adams and Eves, and snakes and apples, And dev'ls, for beautifying certain chapels: But Reynolds is no favourite, that's the matter— He has not learnt the noble art—to flatter This Ode was composed before Sir Joshua was dubbed King's Painter. Possibly the great artist dreamt of my beautiful lyric, and pursued its advice.. Thrice happy times, when monarchs find them hard things, To teach us what to view with admiration; And, like their heads on halfpence and brass farthings, Make their opinions current through the nation! I've heard that Ramsay Late painter to his Majesty., when he died, Left just nine rooms well stuff'd with queens and kings; From whence all nations might have been supplied, That long'd for valuable things. Viceroys, ambassadors, and plenipos, Bought them to join their raree-shows In foreign parts, And show the progress of the British arts. Whether they purchas'd by the pound or yard, I cannot tell, because I never heard; But this I know, his shop was like a fair, And dealt most largely in this royal ware. See what it is to gain a monarch's smile;— And hast thou miss'd it, Reynolds, all this while? How stupid! pr'ythee, seek the courtier's school, And learn to manufacture oil of fool. Flattery's the turnpike-road to Fortune's door— Truth is a narrow lane, all full of quags, Leading to broken heads, abuse and rags, And workhouses—and refuge for the poor!— Flattery's a mountebank so spruce—gets riches; Truth, a plain Simon Pure, a Quaker preacher, A moral mender, a disgusting teacher, That never got a sixpence by her speeches! ODE X. The lofty Peter beginning with an original Simile—Displayeth a deep Knowledge of Homer and modern Duchesses—Concludeth with a Prophecy about his Sovereign. Painters who figure in the Exhibition, Are pretty nearly in the same condition With cocks on Shrove-tide, which the season gathers; Flung at by ev'ry lubber, ev'ry brat, Possessing sense to throw a bat, To break their bones, and knock about their feathers. This little difference, however, lies Between the painter and the fowl, I find:— The artist for the post of danger tries— The fowl is fasten'd much against his mind; Who damns his sentence, would annul it,— Sue out his habeas corpus, and instead Of being beat with bats about the head, Make handsome love to a smart pullet. And yet the painter like a booby groans, Who courts the very bats which break his bones. But who from scandal is exempt? Who does not meet at times contempt? Great Jove, the god of gods, in figures rich, Oft call'd his bosom queen a saucy bitch; Achilles Vid. Homer. call'd great Agamemnon hog, An impudent, deceitful, dirty dog! Behold our lofty duchesses pull caps, And give each other's reputations raps, As freely as the drabs of Drury's school; And who, pray, knows that George our gracious King, (Said by his courtiers to know every thing) May not, by future times, be call'd a fool! ODE XI. The Bard sensibly reproveth the young Artists for their Propensity to Abuse—Most wittily compareth them to Horse-leeches, Game-cocks, and Curs. The mean, the ranc'rous jealousies that swell In some sad artists' souls, I do despise; Instead of nobly striving to excel, You strive to pick out one the other's eyes. To be a painter, was Correggio's glory:— His speech should flame in gold—‘Sono pittore.’ But what, if truth were spoke, would be your speeches? This—‘We're a set of fame-sucking horse-leeches; Without a blush, the poorest scandal speaking— Like cocks, for ever at each other beaking; As if the globe we dwell on were so small, There really was not room enough for all.’ Young men!— I do presume that one of you in ten Has kept a dog or two, and has remark'd, That when you have been comfortably feeding, The curs, without one atom of court breeding, With wat'ry jaws, have whin'd and paw'd, and bark'd; Show'd anxiousness about the mutton bone, And 'stead of your mouth, wish'd it in their own; And if you gave this bone to one or t'other, Heav'ns, what a snarling, quarrelling, and pother! This, p'rhaps, has often touch'd you to the quick, And made you teach good manners by a kick; And if the tumult was beyond all bearing, A little bit of sweet emphatic swearing, An eloquence of wondrous use in wars, Amongst sea captains and the brave jack tars. Now tell me honestly—pray don't you find Somewhat in Christians just of the same kind That you experienc'd in the curs, Causing your anger and demurs? As, for example, when your mistress, Fame, Wishing to celebrate a worthy name, Takes up her trump to give the just applause; How have you, puppy-like, paw'd, wish'd and whin'd; And growl'd, and curs'd, and swore, and pin'd, And long'd to tear the trumpet from her jaws! The dogs deserv'd their kicking to be sure; But you! O fie, boys! go and sin no more. ODE XII. The compassionate Peter lamenteth the Death of Mr. Hone, an R. A.—Recommendeth him to Oblivion, the great Patron of a Number of Geniuses. There's one R. A. more dead! stiff is poor Hone! His works be with him under the same stone: I think the sacred art will not bemoan 'em; But, Muse!—De mortuis nil nisi bonum— As to his host, a trav'ller, with a sneer, Said of his dead small-beer. Go then, poor Hone! and join a numerous train Sunk in Oblivion's wide pacific ocean; And may its whale-like stomach feel no motion To cast thee like a Jonah, up again. ODE XIII. The Poet exhibiteth the Inconstancy of the World, by a most elegant Comparison of a Flock of Starlings. Young artists, it may so fall out, That folks shall make a grievous rout; Follow you—praise your painting to the skies; When, probably, a ribband (fie upon it!) A feather, or a tawdry bonnet, Caught, by its glare, their wonder-spying eyes. Therefore, don't thence suppose that you inherit Mountains of unexampled merit; That always you shall be pursu'd, And like a wondrous beauty woo'd. Great is the world's inconstancy, God knows!— Fame, like the ocean, ebbs, as well as flows; Next year the million pitches on a ruff, A balloon cap—a shawl—a muff;— For you, no longer cares a single rush, Following some other brother of the brush. To raise to nobler flights the Muse's wing, A simile's a very pretty thing; To whose sweet aid I'm oft an humble debtor, T'illustrate with more force the thing I mean;— And if the simile be neat and clean, Tant mieux—that is—so much the better. Therefore, young folks, as there's a great deal in't, Accept one just imported from the mint. You've seen a flock of starlings, to be sure, A hundred thousand in a mess, or more; Who fortunately having found A lump of horse-litter upon the ground, Down drops the chattering cloud upon the dung, Then, Lord, what doings! Heav'ns, what admiration! What joy, what transport 'midst the speckled nation. How busy ev'ry beak, and ev'ry tongue! All talking, gabbling, but none list'ning, Just like a group of gossips at a christ'ning;— Let but a cowdab show its grass-green face, They're up, without so much as saying grace: And lo! the busy flock, around it pitches! Just as upon the lump before, They gabble, wonder, and adore! And equal brother Martyn's A much-admired speaker in the House of Commons, who nem. con. was baptized the Starling Martyn. speeches. These starlings show the world, with great propriety, Mad as March hares, or curlews for variety. ODE XIV. The Great Peter despiseth Frenchmen. I beg it as a favour, my young folks, You will not copy, monkey-like the French, Whose pictures, justly, are all standing jokes, Whether they represent a man or wench. If monsieur paints a man of fashion, Making an obeisance well bred, The gentleman's a ram-cat in a passion, His back all crumpled o'er his head: Or, if he paints a wretch upon the wheel, And bone-breaking's no trifling thing, G?d knows! Amidst his pains the fellow's so genteel! He feels with such decorum all the blows. Or if a culprit's going to the devil, Which some folks deem a serious evil So dégagée you see the man advance, His arms, hands, shoulders, turn'd-out toes, Madona-lifted eyes, and cock'd up nose Proclaim the pretty puppy in a dance. I've seen a sleeping Venus, I declare, With hands and legs stretch'd out with such an air! Her neck and head so twisted on one shoulder, With such a heav'nly smile, that each beholder Would swear (disdaining dancing's vulgar track) The dame was walking minuets on her back! E'en an old woman yielding up her breath By means of cholic, stone, or gravel, How smirkingly she feels the pangs of death; With what a grace her soul prepares to travel! A Frenchman's angel is an Opera Punk; His Virgin Marys—milliners half drunk; Our blest Redeemer, a rank petît-maitre, In every attitude and feature; The humble Joseph, so genteelly made, Poor gentleman—as if above his trade, And only fit to compliment his wife— So delicate! as if he scarcely knew Oak from deal board—a gimlet from a screw, And never made a mouse-trap in his life. Think not I wantonly the French attack:— I never will put Merit on the rack: No!—yet, I own I hate the shrugging dogs— I've liv'd amongst them, eat their frogs, And vomited them up, thank God, again; So that I'm able now to say, I carried nought of theirs away, Which otherwise had made the puppies vain. ODE XV. The conceited Peter turneth an arrant Egotist— Mentioneth a number of fine Folks—This Minute condemneth Will Whitehead's Verses; and the next, exculpateth the Laureat, by clapping the right saddle on the right horse. No giant more rejoiceth in his course, Not Count O'Kelly in a winning horse; Not Mistress Hobart The contest between Mrs. Hobart and Lady Salisbury, with their seconds, about a box at the Opera, is a subject for the most sublime epic. to preserve a box, Not George the Third to triumph o'er Charles Fox; Not Spain's wise monarch to bombard Algiers— Not pillories, obeying law's stern voice, Can more rejoice To hold Kitt Atkinson's two ears; Not more rejoiceth patriotic Pitt, By patriotic grocers to be fed; Not Mother Windsor A priestess of the Cyprian goddess. in a nice young tit, Nor gaping deans, to hear a bishop's dead: Not more reform'd John Wilkes, to court the crown; Nor Skinner in his aldermanic gown, Nor common-councilmen on turtle feeding: Not more rejoice old envious maids, so stale, To hear of weeping beauty a sad tale, And tell the world a reigning toast is breeding:— Than I, the poet, in a lucky ode, That catches at a hop the cynic face; Kills by a laugh its grave Bubonic face; And tears, in spite of him, his jaws abroad. And are there such grave dons that read my rhimes? All-gracious Heav'n forgive their crimes! Oh! be their lot to have wise-talking wives; And if in reading they delight, To read, ye gods! from morn to night, Will Whitehead's This Ode was written before a late laureat resigned his earthly crown for a heavenly one. May Mr. Tom Warton be more successful in his Pindaric adulations, and not verify the Latin adage—Ex nihilo, nihil fit. birth-day sonnets all their lives. Perhaps, reader, thou'rt a tinker, or a tanner; And mendest kettles in a pretty manner; Or tannest hides of bulls, and cows, and calves: But if the saucepan, or the kettle, Originally be bad metal, Thou'lt say, ‘It only can be done by halves;’ Or if by nature bad the bullock's skins, ‘They'll make vile shoes and boots for people's shins.’ Then wherefore do I thus abuse Will Whitehead's hard-driv'n Muse? Who merits rather Pity's tend'rest sigh; For what the devil can he do, When forc'd to praise—the Lord knows who! Verse must be dull on subjects so damn'd dry. ODE XVI. The classic Peter adviseth Painters to cultivate Taste—Lasheth some of the Ignorant—Accuseth Painters of an affection for Vulgarity, whom he horse-whippeth—Recommendeth a charming Subject—Telleth the Secret of his Love, and giveth a die-away Sonnet of former Days—Persecuteth Tenier's Devils, but applaudeth the Execution. Painters, improve your education; That surely stands in need of reformation. I've heard that some can neither write nor read, Which does no honour to the hand or head. Many, I know, would rather paint a bear, Or monkey playing his quaint tricks, Than some sweet damsel, whom all hearts revere, Would rather see a stump with strength express'd, Than all the snowy fulness of her breast, Or lip, that innocence so sweetly moves, Or smile, the fond Elysium of the loves. This brings those days to mem'ry, when my tongue To Cynthia's beauty pour'd my soul in song; When, on the margin of the murm'ring stream, My fancy frequent form'd the golden dream Of Cynthia's grace—of Cynthia's smiles divine, And made those smiles and peerless beauty mine. It brings to mem'ry too, those dismal times, When nought my sighs avail'd, and nought my rhimes; When at the silent, solemn close of day, My pensive steps would court the darkling grove, To hear, in Philomela's lonely lay, The fainting echoes of my luckless love; Till night's increasing shades around me stole, And mingled with the gloom that wrapp'd my soul. Reader—dost choose a sonnet of those days? Take it—and say not I'm a foe to praise. TO CYNTHIA. O Thou! whose love-inspiring air Delights, yet gives a thousand woes; My day declines in dark despair, And night hath lost her sweet repose; Yet who, alas! like me was blest To others e'er thy charms were known; When fancy told my raptur'd breast, That Cynthia smil'd on me alone? Nymph of my soul! forgive my sighs: Forgive the jealous fires I feel; Nor blame the trembling wretch, who dies When others to thy beauties kneel. Lo! theirs is every winning art, With fortune's gifts unknown to me! I only boast a simple heart, In love with innocence and thee. Build not, alas! your popularity On that beast's back yclep'd vulgarity; A beast that many a booby takes a pride in— A beast beneath the noble Peter's riding. How should the man who loves to be unchaste, To feed on carrion dread his hound-like paunch, Judge of an ortolan's delicious taste, Or feel the flavour of a fine fat haunch? Or, wont with bitter purl to wet his clay, How should he judge of claret or tokay? Teniers's devils, witches, monkeys, toads, That make me shudder whilst I pen these Odes, Most truly painted, to be pure, you'll find:— How greater far the excellence, to paint With heaven-directed eye, the beauteous saint, And mark th' emotions of her angel-mind! Envy not such as have in dirt surpast ye;— 'Tis very, very easy to be nasty! ODE XVII. The moralizing Bard exposeth the unfairness of Mankind in the Article of Laughing—Descanteth upon Wit—Disclaimeth Pretension to it— Maketh Love to Candour, and modestly concludeth. How dearly mortals love to laugh and grin! Just as they love to stuff themselves to chin With other people's meat—good saving sense! Because at other folks' expense; But turn the laugh on them—how chang'd their notes! ‘O damn 'em! this is serious—cut their throats!’ Wit, says an author that I do not know, Is like Time's scythe—cuts down both friend and foe; Ready each object, tiger-like, to leap on! ‘Lord! what a butcher this same wit! thank God! (A critic cries) in Master Pindar's Ode, We spy th' effect of no such dangerous weapon.’ No, Sir—'tis dove-ey'd Candour's charms I woo to these desiring arms; She is my goddess—to her shrine I bend: Nympth of the voice, that beats the morning lark. Sweet as the dulcet note of either Park Two brothers, of the most distinguished merit on the oboe., Be thou my soft companion and my friend. Thy lovely hand my Pegasus shall guide, And teach thy modest pupil how to ride: Thus shall I hurt not any group-composers, From Sarah Benwell's brush, to Mary Mozer's The last of those ladies, an R. A. by means of a sublime picture of a plate of gooseberries—the other in hopes of academic honours, through an equal degree of merit.. ODE XVIII. The judicious Peter giveth most wholesome Advice to Landscape Painters. Whate'er your wish in landscape to excel, London's the very place to mar it. Believe the oracles I tell, There's very little landscape in a garret, Whate'er the flocks of fleas you keep, 'Tis badly copying them for goats and sheep; And if you'll take the poet's honest word, A bug must make a miserable bird. A rush-light winking in a bottle's neck, Ill represents the glorious orb of morn; Nay, though it were a candle with a wick, ‘Twould be a representative forlorn. I think, too, that a man would be a fool, For trees, to copy legs of a joint-stool; Or ev'n by them to represent a stump: As also broomsticks—which, though well he rig Each with an old fox-coloured wig, Must make a very poor autumnal clump. You'll say, ‘Yet such ones, oft a person sees In many an artist's trees; And in some paintings, we have all beheld, Green baise hath surely sat for a green field; Bolsters for mountains, hills, and wheaten mows; Cats, for ram-goats; and curs, for bulls and cows.’ All this, my lads, I freely grant; But better things from you, I want. As Shakespeare says (a Bard I much approve) ‘List, list, oh! list,’ if thou dost painting love. Claude painted in the open air! Therefore to Wales at once repair; Where scenes of true magnificence you'll find: Besides this great advantage—if in debt, You'll have with creditors no tête-à-tête. So leave the bull-dog bailiffs all behind; Who, hunt you with what noise they may, Must hunt for needles in a stack of hay. ODE XIX. The Poet hinteth to Artists the Value of Time. The man condemn'd on Tyburn-tree to swing, Deems such a show, a very dullish thing; He'd rather a spectator be, I ween Than the sad actor in the scene. He blames the law's too rigid resolution: If with a beef-steak stomach—in his prime, Lord, with what rev'rence he looks on time! And most of all—the hour of execution! And as the cart doth to the tree advance, How wondrous willing to postpone the dance! Believe me, time's of monstrous use; But, ah! how subject to abuse! It seems that with him, folks were often cloy'd: I do pronounce it, time's a public good, Just like a youthful beauty—to be woo'd, Made much of, and be properly enjoy'd. Time's sand is wonderfully small; It slips between the fingers in a hurry: Therefore, on each young artist let me call, To prize it as an Indian does his curry A universal food in the East-Indies.; Whether his next rare exhibition be Amidst the great R. A.'s—or on a tree. XX. The unfortunate Peter lamenteth the Loss of an important Ode by Rats—He prayeth devoutly for the Rats. Hiatus maxime deflendus! I've lost an Ode of charming praise; From like misfortune, Heav'n defend us! The sweetest of my lyric lays! Where many a youthful artist shone with fame, Like his own pictures in a fine gilt frame. Perdition catch the roguish rats! Their trembling limbs shall fill the maws of cats, Were I to be their sole adviser: Vermin! like trunk-makers, kings, pastry-cooks, Dealing in legions of delightful books, Yet, with the learning, not a whit the wiser. Thank G?d! the Ode unto Myself they spar'd: And, lo! the labour of the lucky bard. ODE XXI. TO MYSELF. The exalted Peter wisheth to make the gaping World acquainted with the Place of his Nativity; but before he can get an Answer from himself, he most sublimely bursteth forth into an Address to Mevagizzy and Mousehole, two Fishing towns in Cornwall—the first celebrated for Pilchards, the last for giving Birth to Dolly Pentreath —The Poet praiseth the Honourable Daines Barrington and Pilchards—Forgetteth the Place of his Nativity; and, like his great Ancestor of Thebes, leaveth his Readers in the dark. O thou! whose daring works sublime Defy the rudest rage of Time, Say!—for the world is with conjecture dizzy, Did Mousehole give thee birth, or Mevagizzy? HAIL, Mevagizzy! with such wonders fraught! Where boats, and men, and stinks, and trade, are stirring; Where pilchards come in myriads to be caught! Pilchards! a thousand times as good as herring. Pilchard! the idol of the Popish nation! Hail, little instrument of vast salvation! Pilchard, I ween, a most soul-saving fish, On which the Catholics in Lent are cramm'd; Who, had they not, poor souls, this lucky dish, Would flesh eat, and be consequently damn'd. Pilchards! whose bodies yield the fragrant oil, And make the London lamps at midnight smile; Which lamps, wide spreading salutary light, Beam on the wandering beauties of the night, And show each gentle youth their cheeks' deep roses, And tell him whether they have eyes and noses. Hail, Mousehole! birth-place of old Doll Pentreath A very old woman of Mousehole, supposed (falsely, however,) to have been the last who spoke the Cornish language. The honourable antiquarian, Daines Barrington, Esq. journeyed, some years since, from London to the Land's-end, to converse with this wrinkled, yet delicious, morceau. He entered Mousehole in a kind of triumph, and, peeping into her hut, exclaimed, with all the fire of an enraptured lover, in the language of the famous Greek philosopher—‘Eureka!’ The couple kissed—Doll soon after gabbled—Daines listened with admiration—committed her speeches to paper, not venturing to trust his memory with so much treasure. The transaction was announced to the Society—the Journals were enriched with their dialogues—the old lady's picture was ordered to be taken by the most eminent artist, and the honourable member to be publicly thanked for the discovery!, The last who jabber'd Cornish—so says Daines, Who, bat-like, haunted ruins, lane, and heath, With Will-o'-wisp, to brighten up his brains. Daines! who a thousand miles, unwearied, trots For bones, brass farthings, ashes, and old pots, To prove that folks of old, like us, were made With heads, eyes, hands, and toes, to drive a trade. ODE XXII. The following Ode was written just after the great Crashes and Falls at Somerset House.— Peter is charmingly ironical. Sir William! cover'd with Chinese renown, Whose houses I take it for granted, that the houses in general built by the knight, are as much in the style of gingerbread as Somerset House. are no sooner up than down, Don't heed the discontented nation's cry: Thine are religious houses!—very humble; Upon their faces much inclin'd to tumble; So meek, they cannot keep their heads on high. I know the foolish kingdom all runs riot, Calling aloud for Wyat, Wyat, Wyat! Who on their good opinion hourly gains. But where lies Wyat's merit?—What his praise! Abroad this roving man spent half his days, Contemplating of Rome, the great remains. This Wyat's works a classic taste combine, Who studied thus the ancients o'er and o'er; But, lo! the greater reputation thine, To do what no man ever did before. ODE XXIII. Peter concludeth his Odes—Seemeth hungry— Expostulateth with the Reader—And getteth the Start of the World, by first praising his own Works. Tom Southern to John Dryden went one day, To buy a head and tail piece for his play:— ‘Thomas,’ quoth John ‘I've sold my goods too cheap; So, if you please, my price shall take a leap.’ O reader, look me gravely in the face;— Speak, is not that with me and thee the case? For this year's Odes I charge thee half a crown: So, without grumbling, put thy money down: For things are desperately ris'n, good Lord! Fish, flesh, coals, candles, window-lights, and board. Why should not charming poetry then rise? That comes so dev'lish far too—from the skies! And, lo! the verses that adorn this page, Beam, comet-like, alas! but once an age. FAREWELL ODES, FOR MDCCLXXXVI. ? Ridentem dicere verum Quid vetat? HORAT. ODE I. Peter talketh of resigning the Laureatship—The Works of the Artists give God Thanks upon the Occasion—He prophesieth the Triumph of the Artists on his Resignation—The Artists also prophesy to Peter's disadvantage—Peter's last Comforts, should their Prophecy be fulfilled. Peter, like fam'd Christina, queen of Sweden, Who thought a wicked court was not an Eden, This year resigns the laurel crown for ever! What all the fam'd Academicians wish; No more on painted fowl, and flesh, and fish, He shows the world his carving skill so clever: Brass, iron, woodwork, stone, in peace shall rest— ‘Thank God!’ exclaim the works of Mr. West: ‘Thank God?’ the works of Loutherbourg exclaim— For guns of critics, no ignoble game— ‘No longer now afraid of rhiming praters, Shall we be christen'd tea-boards, varnish'd waiters: No verse shall swear that ours are paste-board rocks, Our trees brass wigs and mops our fleecy flocks. Thank Heav'n!’ exclaims Rigaud, with sparkling eyes— ‘Then shall my pictures in importance rise, And fill each gaping mouth and eye with wonder:’ Monsieur Rigaud, It may be so, To think thy stars have made so strange a blunder, That bred to paint the genius of a glazier: That spoil'd, to make a dauber—a good brazier: None but thy partial tongue (believe my lays) Can dare stand forth the herald of thy praise: Could Fame applaud, whose voice my verse reveres, Justice should break her trump about her ears. ‘Thank Heav'n!’ cries Mr. Garvy; and ‘Thank God!’ Cries Mr. Copley, ‘that this man of ode, No more, Barbarian-like, shall o'er us ride: No more like beads, in nasty order strung, And round the waist of this wild Mohawk hung, Shall Academic scalps indulge his pride. ‘No more hung up in this dread fellow's rhime, Which he most impudently calls sublime, Shall we, poor inoffensive souls, Appear just like so many moles, Trapp'd in an orchard, garden, or a field; Which mole-catchers suspend on trees, To show their titles to their fees, Like doctors, paid too often for the kill'd.’ Pleas'd that no more my verses shall annoy, Glad that my blister odes shall cease their stinging; Each wooden figure's mouth expands with joy— Hark! how they all break forth in singing! In boastful sounds the grinning artists cry, ‘Lo! Peter's hour of insolence is o'er: His muse is dead—his lyric pump is dry— His odes, like stinking fish, not worth a groat a score: Art thou then weak, like us, thou snarling sniv'ller? Art thou like one of us, thou lyric driv'ller? Our kings and queens in glory now shall lie, Each unmolested, sleeping in his frame; Our ponds, our lakes, our oceans, earth and sky, No longer scouted, shall be put to shame: No poet's rage shall root our stumps and stumplings, And swear our clouds are flying apple-dumplings: Fame shall proclaim how well our plum-trees bud, And sound the merits of our marle and mud. Our oaks, and brushwood, and our lofty elms, No jingling tyrant's wicked rage o'erwhelms, Now this vile feller is laid low: In peace shall our stone-hedges sleep, Our huts, our barns, our pigs and sheep, And wild fowl, from the eagle to the crow. They who shall see this Peter in the street, With fearless eye his front shall meet, And cry—‘Is this the man of keen remark? Is this the wight?’ shall be their taunting speech; ‘A dog! who dar'd to snap each artist's breech, And bite Academicians like a shark? He whose broad cleaver chopp'd the sons of paint; Crush'd, like a marrow-bone, each lovely saint; Spar'd not the very clothes about their backs: The little duck-wing'd cherubims abus'd That could not more inhumanly be us'd, Poor lambkins! had they fall'n amongst the blacks? He, once so furious, soon shall want relief, Stak'd through the body like a paltry thief. ‘How art thou fall'n, O Cherokee!’ they cry; ‘How art thou fall'n!’ the joyful roofs resound; ‘Hell, shall thy body for a rogue, surround, And there, for ever roasting, mayst thou lie: Like Dives mayst thou stretch in fires along, Refus'd one drop of drink to cool thy tongue.’ Ye goodly gentlemen repress your yell: Your hearty wishes for my health restrain; For if our works can put us into h?ll, Kind sirs! we certainly shall meet again: Nay, what is worse, I really don't know whether We must not lodge in the same room together. ODE II. Peter floggeth the Academicians and Dinner—Pitieth the Prince of Wales—Duke of Orleans, Duke Fitzjames, Count Lauzun, Lords Caermarthen and Besborough, &amp;c.—and praiseth Mr. Weltjie—Exculpateth the President—Condemneth Sir W. Chambers and the Committee for their bad Management—Peter talketh of visiting the French King and the Duke of Orleans. Whene'er academicians run astray, Such should the moral Peter's song reclaim— Of paint, this ode shall nothing sing or say, My eagle satire darts at diff'rent game— Against decorum I abhor a sinner; And therefore lash the academic dinner. Th' Academy, though marvellously poor, Can once a year afford to eat: By means of kind donations at the door, The members made a comfortable treat: Like gipsies in a barn around their king, That annual meet, to munch, and dance, and sing. A feast was made of flesh, fish, tarts, creams, jellies, To suit the various qualities of bellies: Mine grumbl'd to be ask'd, and be delighted; But wicked Peter's paunch was not invited. Yet though no message waited on the bard, With compliments from academic names; The Prince of Wales received a civil card, His Grace of Orleans too, and Duke Fitzjames; Count de Lauzun, and Count Conflan, A near relation to the man, In whose poor sides old Hawke once fix'd his claws, Were welcom'd by the academic lords, Either by writing or by words, To come and try the vigour of their jaws. Unfortunately for the modest Dukes, The nimble artists, all with greyhound looks, Fell on the meat with teeth prodigious able: Seiz'd, of the Synagogue, the highest places, And left the poor forlorn, their Gallic Graces, To nibble at the bottom of the table. There sat, too, my good Lord Caermarthen, As one of the canaille, not worth a farthing! But what can titles, virtues, at a feast, Where glory waits upon the greatest beast? To see a stone-cutter and mason High mounted o'er those men of quality, By no means can our annals blazon For feats of courtly hospitality. I've heard, however, one or two were tanners: Granted—it doth not much improve their manners. They probably, in answer, may declare, They thought the feast just like a hunt; In which, as soon as ever starts the hare, Each Nimrod tries to be first in upon't: The greatest, he, amidst the howling fuss, Who first can triumph o'er poor dying puss. Peters A respectable clergyman, and one of the Academicians. most justly rais'd his eyes with wonder, And wanted decently to give them grace; But bent on ven'son and on turbot plunder, A clattering peal of knives and forks took place: Spoons, plates, and dishes, rattling round the table, Produc'd a new edition of old Babel. They had no stomach o'er a grace to nod; Nor time enough to offer thanks to God: That might be done, they wisely knew, When they had nothing else to do. His Highness The Prince of Wales. entering rather somewhat late, Could scarcely find a knife, or fork, or plate: But not a single maiden dish, Poor gentleman! of flesh or fish! Most wofully the pastry had been paw'd, And trembling jellies barbarously claw'd: In short, my gentle readers to amaze, His Highness pick'd the bones of the R. A.'s. O Weltjie The Prince's German cook., had thy lofty form been there, And seen thy Prince so serv'd with scrap and slop, Thou surely wouldst have brought him better fare— A warm beef steak, perchance, or mutton chop. Thou wouldst have said, De Prence of Wales, by Got, Do too mush honour to be at der feast; Vere he can't heb von beet of meat dat's hot, But treated vid de bones just like a beast. De Prence, he vas too great to sit and eat De bones and leafings of de meat; And munsh vat dirty low-lif'd rogues refuse, By Got! not fit to wipe de Prence's shoes!’ Great Besborough's Earl too came off second best; His murmuring stomach had not half a feast; And therefore it was natural to mutter: To rectify the fault, with joyless looks, His lordship bore his belly off to Brookes, Who fill'd the grumbler up with bread and butter. Sirs! those manœuvres were extremely coarse— This really was the essence of ill-breeding: Not for your souls could you have treated worse Bum-bailiffs, by this dog-like mode of feeding. Grant, you eclips'd a pack of hounds, with glee Pursuing, in full cry, the fainting game— Surpass'd them too, in gobbling down the prey: Still great R. A.'s., I tell you 'twas a shame: Grant, each of you the wondrous man excell'd, Who beat a butcher's dog in eating tripe; And that each paunch with guttling was so swell'd, Not one bit more could pass your swallow-pipe: Grant, that you dar'd such stuffing feats display, That not a soul of you could walk away: Still, 'midst the triumphs of your gobbling fame, I tell you, great R. A.'s, it was a shame. Grant, you were greas'd up to the nose, and eyes, Your cheeks all shining like a lantern's horn, With tearing hams and fowls, and giblet pies, And ducks, and geese, and pigeons newly born: Though great, in your opinion, be your fame, I tell you, great R. A.'s, it was a shame. This, let me own—the candour-loving muse Most willingly Sir Joshua can excuse, Who tries the nation's glory to increase; Whose genius rare is very seldom nodding, But deep, on painting subjects, plodding, To rival Italy and Greece. But pray, Sir William Sir W. Chambers. what have you to say? No such impediment lies in your way; Genius can't hurt your etiquette attention; And Messieurs Tyler, Wilton, and Rigaud, Have you a genius to impede you?—No! Nor many a one besides that I could mention. This year (God willing) I shall visit France, And taste of Lewis, Grand Monarque! the prog: His Grace of Orleans, so kind, perchance, May ask me to his house to pick a frog: And yet, what right have I to visit there, Who see a prince so vilely treated here? Ye Royal Artists, at your future feasts, I fear you'll make their Graces downright Daniels, And as the Prophet din'd amongst wild beasts, The dukes will join your pointers and your spaniels. ODE III. Peter administereth sage Advice to mercenary Artists, and telleth a most delectable Story of a Country Bumpkin and a Peripatetic Razorseller. Forbear, my friends, to sacrifice your fame To sordid gain, unless that you are starving: I own that hunger will indulgence claim For hard stone heads, and landscape carving, In order to make haste to sell and eat; For there is certainly a charm in meat: And in rebellious tones will stomachs speak, That have not tasted victuals for a week. But yet there are a mercenary crew, Who value fame no more than an old shoe; Provided for their daubs they get a sale; Just like the man—but stay—I'll tell the tale. A fellow in a market town, Most musical, cried razors up and down, And offer'd twelve for eighteen pence; Which certainly seem'd wondrous cheap, And for the money quite a heap, As ev'ry man wou'd buy, with cash and sense. A country bumpkin the great offer heard: Poor Hodge, who suffer'd by a thick, black beard, That seem'd a shoe-brush stuck beneath his nose: With cheerfulness the eighteen pence he paid, And proudly to himself, in whispers, said, ‘This rascal stole the razors, I suppose: ‘No matter if the fellow be a knave, Provided that the razors shave: It sartinly will be a monstrous prize:’ So home the clown, with his good fortune, went, And quickly soap'd himself to ears and eyes. Being well lather'd from a dish or tub, Hodge now began with grinning pain to grub, Just like a hedger cutting furze: 'Twas a vile razor!—then the rest he try'd— All were impostors—‘Ah,’ Hodge sigh'd! ‘I wish my eighteen pence within my purse.’ In vain to chase his beard, and bring the graces, He cut, and dug, and winc'd and stamp'd, and swore; Brought blood, and danc'd, blasphem'd, and made wry faces, And curs'd each razor's body o'er and o'er: His muzzle, form'd of opposition stuff, Firm as a Foxite, would not lose its ruff; So kept it—laughing at the steel and suds: Hodge in a passion, stretch'd his angry jaws, Vowing the direst vengeance, with clench'd claws, On the vile cheat that sold the goods. Razors! a damn'd confounded dog, Not fit to scrape a hog!’ Hodge sought the fellow—found him, and begun— ‘P'rhaps, Master Razor-rogue, to you 'tis fun, That people flay themselves out of their lives: You rascal! for an hour have I been grubbing, Giving my scoundrel whiskers here a scrubbing, With razors just like oyster knives. Sirrah! I tell you, you're, a knave, To cry up razors that can't shave.’ ‘Friend,’ quoth the razor-man, ‘I am no knave: As for the razors you have bought Upon my soul I never thought That they wou'd shave.’ ‘Not think they'd shave!’ quoth Hodge, with wond'ring eyes, And voice not much unlike an Indian yell; ‘What were they made for then, you dog?’ he cries: ‘Made!’ quoth the fellow, with a smile,—‘to sell.’ ODE IV. Peter observeth the Lex Talionis. West tells the world, that Peter cannot rhime— Peter declares, point blank, that West can't paint; West swears, I've not an atom of sublime— I swear, he hath no notion of a saint: And that his cross-wing'd cherubims are fowls, Baptiz'd by naturalists, owls: Half of the meek apostles, gangs of robbers: His angels, sets of brazen-headed lubbers. The Holy Scripture says, ‘All flesh is grass;’ With Mr. West, all flesh is brick and brass; Except his horse-flesh, that I fairly own Is often of the choicest Portland stone. I've said too, that this artist's faces Ne'er paid a visit to the graces: That on expression he could never brag: Yet for this article hath he been studying; But in it never could surpass a pudding— No, gentle reader, nor a pudding bag. I dare not say, that Mr. West Cannot sound criticism impart: I'm told the man with technicals is blest; That he can talk a deal upon the art: Yes, he can talk, I do not doubt it— ‘About it, goddess, and about it!’ Thus, then, is Mr. West deserving praise— And let my justice the fair laud afford: For, lo! this far-fam'd artist cuts both ways; Exactly like the angel Gabriel's sword: The beauties of the art his converse shews: His canvass almost ev'ry thing that's bad! Thus, at th' Academy, we must suppose, A man more useful, never could be had: Who in himself, a host, so much can do; Who is both precept and example too! ODE V. Great Advice is given to Gentlemen Authors—To Mr. Webb and Mr. H. Walpole particularly—Peter taketh the Part of Lady Lucan—Showeth wonderful knowledge in the Art of Painting—Administereth Oil of Fool, vulgarly called Praise, to the Squire of Strawberry Hill. Astronomers should treat of stars and comets, Physicians of the bark and vomits: Of apoplexies, those light troops of death, That use no ceremony with our breath; Ague and dropsy, jaundice and catarrh, The grim-look tyrant's heavy horse of war. Farriers should write on farcys and the glanders: Bug-doctors only upon bed-disorders: Farmers on land, pigs, cattle, geese and ganders: Nightmen alone, on aromatic odours: The artists should on painting solely write: Like David, then they may ‘good things indite.’ But when the mob of gentlemen Break on their province and take up the pen, The Lord have mercy on the art! I'm sure their goose-quills can no light impart. This verse be thine, 'Squire Webb Author of a Treatise on Painting, who seems to display more erudition than science.—it is thy due: Pray, Mr. Horace Walpole, A gentleman well known in the literary world, an amateur in the Graphic line. what think you? Horace, thou art a man of taste and sense, Then don't, of folly, be at such expense: Do not to Lady Lucan A lady of copying ingenuity in the miniature department. pay such court— Her wisdom surely will not thank thee for't— Ah! don't endeavour thus to dupe her, By swearing that she equals Cooper. A famous miniature painter in the time of Cromwell. So gross the flattery, it seems to show That verily thou dost not know The pow'rs requir'd for copying a picture, And those for copying Dame Nature: Alas! a much more arduous matter! So don't expose thyself, but mind my stricture. Thou'lt say it was mere compliment; That nothing else was thy intent, Although it might disgrace a boy at school: I grant the fact, and think that no man Says or writes sillier things to woman; But still 'tis making each of you a fool. Yet, Horace, think not that I write Through spite: Think not I read thy works with jealous pain: Lord! no, thou art a favourite with me: I think thee one of us, un bel esprit— By heav'ns! I like the windmill of thy brain: It is a pretty and ingenious mill: Long may it grind on Strawb'rry Hill. ODE VI. Peter still continueth to give great Advice, and to exhibit deep Reflection—He telleth a miraculous Story. There is a knack in doing many a thing, Which labour cannot to perfection bring: Therefore however great in your own eyes, Pray do not hints from other folks despise: A fool on something great at times may stumble, And consequently be a good adviser: On which, for ever, your wise men may fumble, And never be a whit the wiser. Yes! I advise you, for there's wisdom in't, Never to be superior to a hint— The genius of each man, with keenness view— A spark from this, or t'other caught, May kindle, quick as thought, A glorious bonfire up in you. A question of you, let me beg— Of fam'd Columbus and his egg, Pray, have you heard? ‘Yes.’—O, then, if you please I'll give you the two Pilgrims and the Peas. THE PILGRIMS AND THE PEAS. A TRUE STORY. A brace of sinners, for no good, Were order'd to the Virgin Mary's shrine, Who at Loretto dwelt, in wax, stone, wood, And in a fair white wig look'd wondrous fine. Fifty long miles had those sad rogues to travel, With something in their shoes much worse than gravel: In short, their toes so gentle to amuse, The priest had order'd peas into their shoes: A nostrum famous in old Popish times For purifying souls that stunk of crimes: A sort of apostolic salt, Which Popish parsons for its powers exalt, For keeping souls of sinners sweet, Just as our kitchen salt keeps meat. The knaves set off on the same day, Peas in their shoes, to go and pray: But very diff'rent was their speed, I wot: One of the sinners gallop'd on, Swift as a bullet from a gun; The other limp'd, as if he had been shot. One saw the Virgin soon—peccavi cried— Had his soul white-wash'd all so clever; Then home again he nimbly hied, Made fit, with saints above, to live for ever. In coming back, however, let me say, He met his brother rogue about half way— Hobbling with out-stretch'd bum and bending knees; Damning the souls and bodies of the peas: His eyes in tears, his cheeks and brows in sweat, Deep sympathizing with his groaning feet. ‘How now,’ the light-toed, white-wash'd pilgrim, broke, ‘You lazy lubber!’ ‘Ods curse it,’ cried the other, ‘'tis no joke— My feet, once hard as any rock, Are now as soft as any blubber. ‘Excuse me, Virgin Mary, that I swear— As for Loretto I shall not get there; No! to the Dev'l my sinful soul must go, For damme if I ha'nt lost ev'ry toe. ‘But, brother sinner, pray explain How 'tis that you are not in pain: What pow'r hath work'd a wonder for your toes Whilst I, just like a snail am crawling, Now swearing, now on saints devoutly bawling, Whilst not a rascal comes to ease my woes? ‘How is't that you can like a greyhound go, Merry, as if that nought had happen'd, burn ye!’ ‘Why,’ cried the other, grinning, ‘you must know, That just before I ventur'd on my journey, To walk a little more at ease, I took the liberty to boil my peas.’ ODE VII. Peter grinneth. Young men, be cautious of each critic word, That blasphemous may much offence afford— I mean, that wounds an ancient master's fame: At Titian, Guido, Julio, Veronese, Your length'ning phiz let admiration seize, And throw up both your eyes at Raphael's name. Ev'n by a print-shop should you chance to pass, Revere the effigy inside a glass: Just as with papists the religious care is, In churches, lanes, to bend their marrow-bones To bees-wax saints, bon-dieux of stones, And beech, and deal, or wainscot Virgin Marys. Whate'er their errors, they no more remain; For time, like fuller's earth, takes out each stain: Nay more—on faults, that modern works would tarnish, Time spreads a sacred coat of varnish. Spare not on brother artists' backs the lash; Put a good wire in't—let it slash; Since ev'ry stroke with int'rest is repaid: For though you cannot kill the man outright, Yet by this effort of your rival spite, Fifty to one, you spoil his trade. His ruins may be feathers for your nest— The maxim's not amiss—probatum est. ODE VIII. The Poet inquireth into the State of the Exhibition—Lasheth Father Time for making great Geniuses, and destroying them—Praiseth Reynolds—Fancieth a very curious Dialogue between King Alexander and the Deer, the Subject of Mr. West's Picture—Turneth to Mr. West's Resurrection. Well, Muse! what is there in the Exhibition? How thrive the beauties of the graphic art? Whose racing genius seems in best condition For Glory's plate to start? Say, what sly rogues old Fame cajole? Speak,—who hath brib'd her trumpet, or who stole? For much is prais'd that ought in fires to mourn— Nay, what would ev'n disgrace a fire to burn. What artist boasts a work sublime, That mocks the teeth of raging Time? Old fool! who after he hath form'd with pains, A genius rare, To make folks stare, Knocks out his brains: Like children, dolls creating with high brags; Then tearing all their handy works to rags. Lo! Reynolds shines with undiminish'd ray! Keeps, like the bird of Jove, his distant way— Yet simple portrait strikes too oft our eyes, Whilst hist'ry, anxious for his pencil, sighs. We don't desire to see on canvass live The copy of a jowl of lead; When for th' original we wou'd not give A small pin's head. This year, of picture, Mr. West Is quite a Patagonian maker— He knows that bulk is not a jest; So gives us painting by the acre: But, ah! this artist's brush can never brag Upon King Alexander and the stag: For as they play'd at loggerheads a rubber; We surely ought to see a handsome battle Between the monarch and the piece of cattle; Whereas each keeps his distance, like a lubber. His Majesty upon his breech laid low, Seems preaching to his horned foe; Observing what a very wicked thing To hurt the sacred person of a king: And seems, about the business, to entreat him To march, for fear the hounds should eat him. The stag appears to say in plaintive note, ‘I own, King Alexander, my offence: True! I've not show'd my loyalty, nor sense; So bid your huntsman come and cut my throat.’ The cavalry, adorn'd with fair stone bodies, Seem on the dialogue, with wonder, staring; And on their flinty backs a set of noddies, Not one brass farthing for their master caring. Behold! one fellow lifts his mighty spear, To save the owner of the Scottish crown; Which, harmless hanging o'er the gaping deer, Seems in no mighty hurry to come down. Another on a Pegasus comes flying! His phiz his errand much belying; For if he means to baste the beast so cruel, God knows, 'tis with a face of water-gruel. So then, sweet Muse, the picture boasts no merit— As flat as dish-water, or dead small-beer— Or (what the mark is tolerably near) As heads of aldermen devoid of spirit. Well then! turn round—view t'other side the room, And see his Saviour mounting from the tomb: Is this piece too with painting sins so cramm'd, Born to increase the number of the damn'd! My sentiments by no means I refuse— Was our Redeemer like that wretched thing, I should not wonder that the cunning Jews Scorn'd to acknowledge him for king. ODE IX. Peter moralizeth, and giveth good Advice. Envy and Jealousy, that pair of devils Stuff'd like Pandora's box with wondrous evils, I hate, abhor, abominate, detest, Like Circe turning man into a beast. Beneath their cankering breath no bud can blow; Their black'ning pow'r resembles smut in corn, Which kills the rising ears, that should adorn, And bid the vales with golden plenty glow. Yet fierce, in yonder dome The Royal Academy., each demon reigns; Their poison swells too many an artist's veins, Draws from each lab'ring heart the fearful sigh, And casts a sullen gloom on ev'ry eye. Brushmen! accept the counsel Peter sends, Who scorns th' acquaintance of this brace of fiends: Should any with uncommon talents tow'r; To any is superior science giv'n— O, let the weaker feel their happy pow'r, Like plants that triumph in the dews of heav'n. Be pleas'd, like Reynolds, to direct the blind; Who aids the feeble falt'ring feet of youth; Unfolds the ample volume of his mind, With genius stor'd and nature's simple truth: Who, though a sun, resembles not his brother, Whose beams so full of jealousy, conspire, Whene'er admitted to the room, to smother The humble kitchen, or the parlour fire. ODE X. Peter speaketh figuratively—Accommodateth himself to vulgar Readers—Lasheth Pretenders to Fame—Concludeth merrily. A modest love of praise I do not blame— But I abhor a rape on mistress Fame— Although the lady is exceeding chaste, Young forward bullies seize her round the waist, Swear, nolens volens, that she shall be kiss'd; And, though she vows she does not like 'em, Nay threatens for their impudence to strike 'em, The saucy varlets still persist. Reader!—of images here's no confusion— Thou therefore understand'st the bard's allusion; But possibly thou hast a thickish head: And therefore no vast quantities of brain— Why then, my precious pig of lead, 'Tis necessary to explain. Some artists, if I so may call 'em, So ignorant (the foul fiend maul 'em) Mere driv'lers in the charming art; Are vastly fond of being prais'd; Wish to the stars, like Blanchard The celebrated balloonist., to be rais'd: And rais'd they should be, reader—from a cart. If disappointed in some Stentor's tongue, Upon themselves they pour forth prose or song, Or buy it in some venal paper, And then heroically vapour. What prigs to immortality aspire, Who stick their trash around the room!— Trash meriting a very diff'rent doom— I mean the warmer regions of the fire! Heav'n knows, that I am anger'd to the soul, To find some blockheads of their works so vain— So proud to see them hanging, cheek by jowl, With his The President., whose pow'rs the art's high fame sustain. To wondrous merit their pretension, On such vicinity-suspension, Brings to my mind a not unpleasant story, Which, gentle readers, let me lay before ye. A shabby fellow chanc'd one day to meet The British Roscius in the street, Garrick, on whom our nation justly brags— The fellow hugg'd him with a kind embrace— ‘Good sir, I do not recollect your face,’ Quoth Garrick—‘No!’ replied the man of rags; ‘The boards of Drury you and I have trod Full many a time together, I am sure—’ ‘When?’ with an oath, cried Garrick—‘for by G? I never saw that face of yours before!— What characters, I pray, Did you and I together play?’ ‘Lord!’ quoth the fellow, ‘think not that I mock— When you play'd Hamlet, sir,—I play'd the cock In the ghost scene..’ ODE XI. Peter talketh sensibly and knowingly—recommendeth it to Artists to prefer Pictures for their Merit—Discovereth musical Knowledge, and showeth that he not only hath kept Company with Fid-lers, but Fiddle-makers—He satirizeth the Pseudo-cognoscenti—Praiseth his ingenious Neighbour Sir Joshua. Be not impos'd on by a name; But bid your eye the picture's merit trace: Poussin at times in outline may be lame, And Guido's angels destitute of grace. Yet, lo! a picture of some famous school, A warranted old daub of reputation, Where charming painting's almost ev'ry rule Hath suffer'd almost every violation; Hath oft been gaz'd at by devouring eyes, Where nature, banish'd from the picture, sighs. So some old duchess, as a badger grey, Her snags by Time, sure dentist, snatch'd away, With long, lank, flannel cheeks, Where Age in ev'ry wrinkled feature, Unto the poor weak shaking creature, Of death unwelcome tidings speaks, Draws from the gaping mob the envying look, Because her owner chanc'd to be a duke. How many pasteboard rocks and iron seas, How many torrents wild of still stone water, How many brooms and broomsticks meant for trees, Because the fancied labours of Salvator Salvator Rosa., Whose pencil too most grossly may have blunder'd, Have brought the blest possessor many a hundred. Thus prove a crowd a Stainer A German fiddle-maker. or Amati A maker of the fiddles called Cremonas., No matter for the fiddle's sound; The fortunate possessor shall not bate ye A doit of fifty, nay a hundred, pound; And though what's vulgarly baptiz'd a rep, Shall in a hundred pounds be deem'd dog-cheap. It tickles one excessively to hear Wise prating pedants the old masters praise: Damning by wholesale, with sarcastic sneer, The luckless works of modern days; Making at living wights such fatal pushes, As if not good enough to wipe their brushes: And yet on each wise cognoscenté ass, Who shall for hours on paint and sculpture din ye, A person with facility may pass Rigaud for Raphael—Bacon for Bernini: Or, little as an oven to Vesuvius, Will Tyler for Palladio or Vitruvius! One wou'd imagine by the mad'ning fools, Who talk of nothing but the ancient schools, And vilify the works of modern brains, They think poor mother Nature's art is fled, That now she cannot make a head, Who took with old Italian pates such pains; Nay, to a driv'ller turn'd, her power so sunk is, Tame soul! that nothing now she makes, but monkeys: ‘Look at your fav'rite Reynolds,’ is their strain,— ‘Allow'd by all, the first in Europe's eye: One atom of repute can Reynolds gain, When Titian, Rubens, and Vandyke are nigh? Can Reynolds live near Raphael's matchless line?’ Yes, blinkards! and with lustre shine! ODE XII. Peter increaseth in Wisdom, and adviseth wisely—Seemeth angry at the Illiberality of Nature in the Affair of his good Acquaintance, the Lord High Chancellor of England and Mr. Pepper Arden—Peter treateth his Readers with Love-Verses of past Times. Copy not nature's forms too closely, Whene'er she treats your sitter grossly: For when she gives deformity for grace, Pray show a little mercy to the face. Indeed 'twould be but charity to flatter Some dreadful works of seeming drunken nature: As for example, let us now suppose Thurlow's black scowl, and Pepper Arden's nose: But when your pencil's powers are bid to trace The smiles of Devonshire—Duncannon's grace— To bid the blush of beauteous Campbell rise, And wake the radiance of Augusta's Second daughter of the king. eyes (Gad! Muse, thou art beginning to grow loyal), And paint the graces of the Princess Royal, Try all your art—and when your toils are done, You show a flimsy meteor for a sun. Or should your skill attempt her face and air, Who fir'd my heart and fix'd my roving eye— The loves, who robb'd a world to make her fair, Would quickly triumph, and your art defy. Sweet nymph!—But, reader, take the song, Which Cynthia's charms alone inspir'd; That left of yore the poet's tongue, When love his raptur'd fancy fir'd. SONG. From her, alas! whose smile was love, I wander to some lonely cell: My sighs too weak the maid to move, I bid the flatterer, Hope, farewell. Be all her siren arts forgot, That fill'd my bosom with alarms: Ah! let her crime—a little spot, Be lost amidst her blaze of charms. As on I wander slow, my sighs At ev'ry step for Cynthia mourn: My anxious heart within me dies, And sinking, whispers, ‘Oh, return!’ Deluded heart! thy folly know— Nor fondly nurse the fatal flame— By absence thou shalt lose thy woe, And only flutter at her name. Readers. I own the song of love is sweet, Most pleasing to the soul of gentle Peter: Your eyes then with another let me treat, O gentle sirs, and in the same sweet metre. SONG TO DELIA. Say, lonely maid, with down-cast eye— O Delia, say, with cheek so pale; What gives thy heart the length'ned sigh, That tells the world a mournful tale? Thy tears, that thus each other chase, Bespeak a bosom swell'd with woe: Thy sighs, a storm that wrecks thy peace, Which souls like thine should never know. O tell me doth some favour'd youth, With virtue tir'd, thy beauty slight; And leave those thrones of love and truth, That lip and bosom of delight? Perhaps, to nymphs of other shades He feigns the soft impassion'd tear, With songs their easy faith invades, That treach'rous won thy witless ear. Let not those maids thy envy move, For whom his heart may seem to pine— That heart can ne'er be blest by love, Whose guilt could force a pang from thine. ODE XIII. Pious Peter acknowledgeth great obligations to the Reverend Mr. Martyn Luther—Yet lamenteth the Effects of this Parson's Reformation on Painting. We protestants owe much to Martyn Luther, Who found to heav'n a shorter way and smoother; And shall not soon repay the obligation: Martyn against the papists got the laugh, Who, as the butchers bleed and bang a calf To whiteness—bled and bang'd unto salvation: As if such drubbings could expel their sins: As if that Pow'r, whose works with awe we view, Grac'd all our backs with sets of comely skins, Then order'd us to beat them black and blue. Well then! we must confess for certain, That much we owe to brother Martyn, Who altered for the better our religion— Yet by it glorious painting much did lose— Was pluck'd, poor goddess! like a goose, Or, for the rhime's sake like a pigeon. Mad at the whore of Babylon and bull; Down from the churches men began to pull Pictures that long had held a lofty station— Pictures of saints of pious reputation, For curing by a miracle the ills That now so stubborn yield not to devotions, But unto blisters, bolusses, and potions, That make such handsome ‘pothecaries’ bills. Down tumbled Anthony who preach'd to sprats— And he who held discourses with a hog Commonly known by the name of Pig Anthony., That grunting after him so us'd to jog, Came down by favour of long sticks and bats. The saints who grin'd on spits like ven'son roasting, Broiling on gridir'ns—baking in an oven; Or on a fork like cheese of Cheshire toasting, Or kick'd to death by Satan's hoof so cloven; All humbled to the ground were forc'd to fall— Spits, forks, and gridir'ns, ovens, dev'l and all. Ev'n saints of poor old England's breeding, In marvels many foreign ones exceeding, Our hot reformers did as roughly handle: In troth, poor harmless souls! they met no quarter But down were tumbled miracle and martyr, Put up in lots, and sold by inch of candle. Had we been papists—Lord! we still had seen Devils and devils' mates, young pimping liars, Tempting the blushing nuns of frail fifteen, With gangs of ogling, rosy, wanton friars: Which nuns so pure no love-speech could cajole— Who starv'd the body to preserve the soul. Then had we seen St. Dennis with his head Fresh in his hand, and with affection kissing; As if the nob, that from his shoulders fled By knife or broad-sword, never had been missing: Then had we seen, upon their friendly coating, Saints on the waves, like gulls and widgeons, floating. I've seen a saint on board a ship, To whom for a fair wind the papists pray, Well flogg'd from stem to stern by birch and whip, Poor wooden fellow! twenty times a day: Pull'd by the nose, and kick'd—call'd lubber, owl, To make him turn a wind to fair from foul! And often this hath brought a prosp'rous gale, When pray'rs and curses have been found to fail. This, had we papists been, had grac'd our churches, Saints, seamen, nose-pulling, kicks, whips, and birches. ODE XIV. Peter attacketh the Exotic R. A.'s Ye royal sirs! before I bid adieu,— Let me inform you, some deserve my praise: But trust me, gentle 'squires, ye are but few Whose names would not disgrace my lays: You'll say, with grinning sharp sarcastic face, ‘We must be bad indeed, if that's the case’— Why, if the truth I must declare, So, gentle 'squires, you really are. I'm greatly pleas'd, I must allow, To see the foreigners beat hollow; Who stole into that dome The Royal Academy. the Lord knows how: I hope to God no more will follow: Who, curs'd with a poor sniv'ling spirit, Were never known to vote for merit— Poor narrow-minded imps, Hanging together just like shrimps. I own (so little they have merited) That from yon noble dome, Made almost an Italian and French home, I long to see the vermin ferreted. Yet where's the house, however watch'd by cats, That can get rid of all its rats? Or, if a prettier simile may please, Where is the bed that has no fleas? Or if a prettier still—what London rugs Have not at times been visited by bugs? ODE XV. Peter taketh leave—Displayeth wonderful Learning—Seemeth sorry to part with his Readers—Administereth Crumbs of Comfort. My dearest readers! 'tis with grief I tell, That now, for ever, I must bid farewell!— Glad if an ode of mine with grins can treat ye, Valete: And if you like the lyric Peter's oddity; Plaudite. Rich as a Jew am I in Latian lore— So, classic readers, take a sentence more: Pulchrum est monstrari digito et dicier hic est! Says Juvenal, who lov'd a bit of fame— In English—ah! 'tis sweet amongst the thickest To be found out, and pointed at, by name. To hear the shrinking great exclaim, ‘that's Peter, Who makes much immortality by metre, Who nobly dares indulge the tuneful whim, And cares no more for Kings than Kings for him!’ Yet one word more, before we part— Should any take it grievously to heart, Look melancholy, pale, and wan, and thin, Like a poor pullet that hath eat a pin, Put on a poor desponding face and pine, Because that Peter the divine Resolves to give up painting odes:— By all the rhiming goddesses and gods, I here upon a poet's word protest, That if it is the world's request That I again in lyrics should appear, Lo! rather than be guilty of the sin Of losing George the Third one subject's skin, My lyric bagpipe shall be tun'd next year. THE LOUSIAD, AN HEROI-COMIC POEM. TO THE READER. GENTLE READER, It is necessary to inform thee, that his Majesty actually discovered, some time ago, as he sat at table, a louse on his plate. The emotion occasioned by the unexpected appearance of such a guest can be better imagined than described. An edict was, in consequence, passed for shaving the cooks, scullions, &amp;c. and the unfortunate Louse condemned to die. Such is the foundation of the Lousiad. With what degree of merit the poem is executed, the uncritical as well as critical reader will decide. The ingenious Author, who ought to be allowed to know somewhat of the matter, hath been heard privately to declare, that in his opinion the Batrachomyomachia of Homer, the Secchia Rapita of Tassoni, the Lutrin of Boileau, the Dispensary of Garth, and the Rape of the Lock of Pope, are not to be compared to it,—and to exclaim at the same time with the modest assurance of an author— Cedite, scriptores Romani; cedite, Graii— Nil ortum in terris, Lousiadâ, melius. Which, for the sake of the mere English reader, is thus beautifully translated:— Roman and Grecian authors, great and small, The author of the Lousiad beats you all. CANTO I. THE ARGUMENT.

Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere versu Nostra, nec erubuit sylvas habitare, Thalia. Cum canerem reges et prælia, Cynthius aurem Vellit et admonuit ? VIRGIL. I, who so lately in my lyric lays Sung to the praise and glory of R. A.'s; And sweetly tun'd to Love the melting line, With Ovid's art, and Sappho's warmth divine; Said, (nobly daring!) ‘Muse, exalt thy wings, Love and the Sons of Canvass quit for Kings.’ Apollo, laughing at my powers of song, Cry'd, ‘Peter Pindar prithee hold thy tongue.’ But I, like poets, self-sufficient grown, Reply'd, ‘Apollo, prithee hold thy own.’ The Louse I sing, who, from some head unknown, Yet born and educated near a throne, Dropp'd down—(so will'd the dread decree of fate), With legs wide sprawling on the monarch's plate: Far from the raptures of a wife's embrace, Far from the gambols of a tender race, Whose little feet he taught with care to tread Amidst the wide dominions of the head; Led them to daily food with fond delight, And taught the tiny wand'rers where to bite; To hide, to run, advance, or turn their tails, When hostile combs attack'd, or vengeful nails: Far from those pleasing scenes ordain'd to roam, Like wise Ulysses, from his native home; Yet, like that sage, though forc'd to roam and mourn, Like him, alas! not fated to return, Who, full of rags and glory, saw his boy Telemachus. And wife Penelope. again, and dog Argus, for whose history see the Odyssey. that died for joy. Down dropp'd the luckless louse, with fear appall'd, And wept his wife and children as he sprawl'd. Thus on a promontory's misty brow, The poet's eye, with sorrow, saw a cow Take leave abrupt of bullocks, goats, and sheep, By tumbling headlong down the dizzy steep; No more to reign a queen amongst the cattle, And urge her rival beaux, the bulls, to battle; She fell ? moriens dulces reminiscitur Argos., rememb'ring ev'ry roaring lover, With all her wild courants in fields of clover. Now on his legs, amidst a thousand woes, The louse, with judge-like gravity, arose; He wanted not a motive to entreat him, Beside the horror that the King might eat him. The dread of gasping on the fatal fork, Stuck with a piece of mutton, beef, or pork, Or drowning 'midst the sauce in dismal dumps, Was full enough to make him stir his stumps. Vain hope of stealing unperceiv'd away! He might as well have tarried where he lay. Seen was this Louse, as with the royal brood Our hungry king amus'd himself with food; Which proves (though scarce believ'd by one in ten) That kings have appetites like common men; And that, like London aldermen and mayor, They feed on solids less refin'd than air. Paint, heav'nly Muse, the look, the very look, That of the sov'reign's face possession took, When first he saw the Louse, in solemn state, Grave as a Spaniard, march across the plate! Yet, could a Louse a British King surprise, And like a pair of saucers stretch his eyes? The little tenant of a mortal head, Shake the great ruler of three realms with dread? Good Lord! (as somebody sublimely sings) What great effects arise from little things! As many a loving swain and nymph can tell, Who, following nature's law, have lov'd too well! Not with more horror did his eyes behold Charles Fox, that cunning enemy of old, When triumph hung upon his plotting brains, And dear prerogative was just in chains: Not with more horror did his eye-balls work Convulsive on the patriot Burke, When guilty of œconomy, the crime! Edmund wide wander'd from the true sublime, And, cat-like, watchful of the flesh and fish, Cribb'd from the royal table many a dish— Saw ev'ry slice of bread and butter cut, Each apple told, and number'd ev'ry nut; And gaug'd (compos'd upon no sneaking scale) The monarch's belly like a cask of ale; Convinc'd that, in his scheme of state-salvation, To starve His majesty was really reduced some time since to a most mortifying dilemma: the apples at dinner time having been, by too great liberality to the royal children, expended, the king ordered a supply, but was informed, that the Board of Green Cloth would positively allow no more. Enraged at the unexpected and unroyal disappointment, he furiously put his hand into his pocket, took out sixpence, sent a page for two pennyworth of pippins, and received the change. the palace, was to save the nation: Not more aghast he look'd, when, 'midst the course, He tumbled, in a stag-chase, from his horse, Where all his nobles deem'd their monarch dead; But, luckily, he pitch'd upon his head! Not ven'son eaters at the vanish'd fat, With stomachs wider than a quaker's hat: Not with more horror Mr. Serjeant Pliant Looks down upon an empty-handed client: Not with more horror stares the rural maid, By hopes, by fortune-tellers, dreams, betray'd, Who sees her ticket a dire blank arise, Too fondly thought the twenty-thousand prize, With which the simple damsel meant, no doubt, To bless her faithful fav'rite, Colin Clout: Not with more horror stares each lengthen'd feature, Of some fine, fluttering, mincing petit maître, When of a wanton chimney-sweeping wag The beau's white vestment feels the sooty bag; Not with more horror did the Devil look, When Dunstan by the nose the dæmon took (As gravely say our legendary songs), And led him with a pair of red-hot tongs; Not Lady Worsley, chaste as many a nun, Look'd with more horror at Sir Richard's fun, When rais'd on high to view her naked charms, He held the peeping captain in his arms; Like David, that most am'rous little dragon, Ogling sweet Bethsheba without a rag on: Not more the great Sam House In Westminster Hall, where the sense (the author was just about to say nonsense) of the people was to be taken on an election. with horror star'd, By mob affronted to the very beard; Whose impudence (enough to damn a jail) Snatch'd from his waving hand his fox's tail, And stuff'd it, 'midst his thunders of applause, Full in the centre of Sam's gaping jaws, That forcing down his patriotic throat, Of ‘Fox and freedom!’ stopp'd the glorious note: Not with more horror Billy Ramus Billy ramus—emphatically and constantly called by his majesty Billy Ramus. One of the pages who shaves the sovereign, airs his shirts, reads to him, writes for him, and collects anecdotes. star'd, When Puff Puff, his Royal Highness's hair-dresser, who attending him at Windsor, the Prince, with his usual good-nature, ordered him to dine with the pages. The pride of the pages immediately took fire, and a petition was despatched to the king and prince, to be relieved from the distressful circumstance of dining with a hair-dresser. The petition was treated with the proper contempt, and the pages commanded to receive Mr. Puff into their mess, or quit the table. With unspeakable mortification Mr. Ramus and his brethren submitted; but, like the poor Gentoos who have lost their cast, have not held up their heads since., the prince's hair-dresser, appear'd Amidst their eating-room, with dread design To sit with pages, and with pages dine! Not with more horror Gloster's duchess star'd, When (blest in metaphor!) the King declar'd, That not of all her mongrel breed, one whelp Should in the royal kennel ever yelp: Not more that man so sweet, so unprepar'd, The gentle 'squire of Leatherhead Kynaston is the name of the gentleman assailed by this furious maid of honour, for disapprobation of the lady as an acquaintance for his wife., was scar'd, When, after prayers so good, and rare a sermon, He found his front attack'd by fierce Miss Vernon; Who meant (Thalestris-like, disdaining fear!) To pour her foot in thunder on his rear; Who, in God's house Verily in the house of the Lord, on the Lord's day, in the year of our Lord 1785 in the village of Leatherhead, in the county of Surrey, did this profane salival assault take place on the phiz of 'Squire Kynaston, to the disgrace of his family, the wonder of the parson, the horror of the clerk, and the stupefaction of the congregation., without one grain of grace, Spit, like a vixen, in his worship's face; Then shook her nails, as sharp as tailor's shears, That itch'd to scrape acquaintance with his ears: Not Atkinson Mr. Christopher Atkinson's airing on the pillory is sufficiently known to the public. with stronger terror started (Somewhat afraid, perchance, of being carted) When justice, a sly dame, one day thought fit To pay her serious compliments to Kit; Ask'd him a few short questions about corn, And whisper'd, she believ'd he was forsworn; Then hinted, that he probably would find, That though she sometimes wink'd, she was not blind: Not more Asturias' Princess This quarrel between the Prince of Asturias and his Princess, with the interference of the Spanish monarch, as described here, is not a poetic fiction, but an absolute fact, that happened not many months ago. look'd affright, At breakfast, when her spouse, the unpolite, Hurl'd, madly heedless both of time and place, A cup of boiling coffee in her face, Because the fair one eat a butter'd roll, On which the selfish prince had fix'd his soul: Not more astonish'd look'd that prince, to find His royal father to his face unkind; Who, to the cause of injur'd beauty won, Seiz'd on the proud proboscis of his son (Just like a tiger of the Libyan shade, Whose furious claws the helpless deer invade), And led him, till that son its durance freed, By asking pardon for the brutal deed; Led him thrice round the room (the story goes), Who follow'd with great gravity his nose, Resolv'd at first (for Spaniards are stiff stuff) To ask no pardon, though the snout came off: Not more astonish'd look'd that Spanish king His most Catholic Majesty's shooting merits are universally acknowledged. Though far advanced in years, he is still the admiration of his subjects, and the envy of his brother kings, as a shot; and it is well known, that even on those days when the royal robes are obliged to be worn, his breeches pockets are stuffed with gun flints, screws, hammers, and other implements necessary for the destruction of snipes, partridges, and wild pigs., Whene'er he miss'd a snipe upon the wing: Not more astonish'd look'd that King of Spain, To see his gun-boats blazing on the main: Not Doctor Johnson more, to hear the tale Of vile Piozzi's marrying Madam Thrale; Nor Doctor Wilson, child of am'rous folly, When young Mac Clyster bore off Kate Macaulay The fair historian.. What dire emotions shook the Monarch's soul! Just like two billiard balls his eyes 'gan roll, Whilst anger all his royal heart possess'd, That, swelling, wildly bump'd against his breast, Bounc'd at his ribs with all its might so stout, As resolutely bent on jumping out, T'avenge, with all its pow'rs the dire disgrace, And nobly spit in the offender's face. Thus a large dumpling to its cell confin'd (A very apt allusion to my mind), Lies snug, until the water waxeth hot, Then bustles 'midst the tempest of the pot: In vain!—the lid keeps down the child of dough, That bouncing, tumbling, sweating, rolls below. ‘How, how? what, what?—what's that, what's that?’ he cries, With rapid accent, and with staring eyes— ‘Look there, look there—what's got into my house? A louse, God bless us! louse, louse, louse, louse, louse.’ The queen look'd down, and then exclaim'd, ‘Good la?’ And with a smile the dappled stranger saw; Each princess strain'd her lovely neck to see, And, with another smile, exclaim'd. ‘Good me!’ ‘Good la! Good me! is that all you can say?’ (Our gracious monarch cry'd, with huge dismay), ‘What! what a silly vacant smile take place Upon your majesty's and children's face, Whilst that vile louse (soon, soon to be unjointed!) Affront's the presence of the Lord's anointed!’ Dash'd, as if tax'd with hell's most deadly sins, The queen and princesses drew in their chins, Look'd prim, and gave each exclamation o'er, And, prudent damsels, ‘word spake never more.’ Sweet maids! the beauteous boast of Britain's isle, Speak—were those peerless lips forbid to smile? Lips! that the soul of simple nature moves— Form'd by the bounteous hands of all the Loves! Lips of delight! unstained by satire's gall! Lips! that I never kiss'd—and never shall. Now, to each trembling page, a poor mute mouse, The pious monarch cry'd, ‘Is this your louse?’ ‘Ah! sire,’ replied each page with pig-like whine, ‘An't please your majesty, it is not mine.’ ‘Not thine?’ the hasty monarch cry'd again, ‘What, what? who's, who's then? who the devil's then?’ Now at this sad event the sovereign, sore, Unhappy, could not take a mouthful more; His wiser queen, her gracious stomach studying, Stuck most devoutly to the beef and pudding; For Germans are a very hearty sort, Whether begot in hog-styes or a court, Who bear (which shows their hearts are not of stone) The ills of others better than their own. Grim terror seiz'd the souls of all the pages, Of different sizes, and of different ages; Frighten'd about their pensions or their bones, They on each other gap'd, like Jacob's sons! Now to a page, but which we can't determine, The growling monarch gave the plate and vermin: ‘Watch well that blackguard animal,’ he cries, ‘That soon or late, to glut my vengeance dies! Watch, like a cat, that vile marauding louse, Or George shall play the devil in the house. Some spirit whispers, that to cooks I owe The precious visitor that crawls below; Yes, yes! the whisp'ring spirit tells me true, And soon shall vengeance all their locks pursue. Cooks, scourers, scullions too, with tails of pig, Shall lose their coxcomb curls, and wear a wig.’ Thus roar'd the king—not Hercules so big; And all the palace echo'd—‘Wear a wig!’ Fear, like an ague, struck the pale-nos'd cooks, And dash'd the beef and mutton from their looks, Whilst from each cheek the rose withdrew its red, And Pity blubber'd oe'r each menac'd head. But, lo! the great cook-major Dixon. comes! his eyes Fierce as the redd'ning flame that roasts and fries; His cheeks like bladders with high passion glowing, Or like a fat Dutch trumpeter's when blowing: A neat white apron his huge corpse embrac'd, Tied by two comely strings about his waist; An apron that he purchas'd with his riches, To guard from hostile grease his velvet breeches— An apron that in Monmouth-street high hung, Oft to the winds with sweet deportment swung. ‘Ye sons of dripping, on your major look! (In sounds of deep-ton'd thunder cry'd the cook) By this white apron, that no more can hope To join the piece in Mister Inkle's shop; That oft has held the best of palace meat, And from this forehead wip'd the briny sweat; I swear this head disdains to loose its locks; And those that do not tell them they are blocks. Whose head, my cooks, such vile disgrace endures? Will it be yours, or yours, or yours, or yours? Ten thousand crawlers in that head be hatch'd, For ever itching but be never scratch'd! Then may the charming perquisite of grease The mammon of your pocket ne'er increase;— Grease! that so frequently hath brought you coin, From veal, pork, mutton, and the great sir loin: O brothers of the spit, be firm as rocks— Lo! to no king on earth I yield these locks. Few are my hairs behind, by age endear'd! But, few or many, they shall not be shear'd. Sooner shall Madam Schwellenberg Mistress of the robes to her majesty., the jade, Yield up her fav'rite perquisites of trade, Give up her majesty's old cloaks and gowns, Caps, petticoats, and aprons, without frowns: She! who for ever studies mischief—She! Who soon will be as busy as a bee, To get the liberty of locks enslav'd, And ev'ry harmless cook and scullion shav'd— She! if by chance a British servant maid, By some insinuating tongue betray'd, Induc'd the fair forbidden fruit to taste, Grows, luckless, somewhat bigger in the waist; Rants, storms, swears, turns the penitent to door, Grac'd with the pretty names of b?ch and w?, To range a prostitute upon the town, Or, if the weeping wretch think better, drown:— But, if a German spider-brusher fails, Whose nose grows sharper, and whose shape tells tales; Hush'd is th' affair!—the queen and she, good dame, Both club their wits to hide the growing shame; To wed her, get some fool—I mean some wise man; Then dub the prudent cuckold an exciseman: She! who hath got more insolence and pride, God mend her heart! than half the world beside: She! who, of guttling fond, stuffs down more meat, Heav'n help her stomach! than ten men can eat! Ten men!—aye, more than ten—the hungry hag!— Why, zounds! the woman's stomach's like a bag: She! who will swell the uproar of the house, And tell the king damn'd lies about the louse; When probably that louse (a vile old trull!) Was born and nourish'd in her own grey skull: Sooner the room shall buxom Nanny Buxom Nanny—a female servant of the palace, who constantly attends the king when he reads dispatches. quit, Where oft she charms her master with her wit— Tells tales of ev'ry body, ev'ry thing, From honest courtiers to the thieves who swing— Waits on her sov'reign while he reads dispatches, And wisely winds up state affairs or watches: Sooner the prince (may Heav'n his income mend!) Shall quit his bottle, mistress, or his friend— Laugh at the drop on Misery's languid eye, And hear her sinking voice without a sigh; Break for the wealth of realms his sacred word, And let the world write coward on his sword: Sooner shall ham from fowl and turkey part, And stuffing leave a calf's or bullock's heart: Sooner shall toasted cheese take leave of mustard, And from the codlin tart be torn the custard: Sooner these hands the glorious haunch shall spoil, And all our melted butter turn to oil: Sooner our pious king, with pious face, Sit down to dinner without saying grace; And ev'ry night salvation pray'rs put forth, For Portland, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and North: Sooner shall fashion order frogs and snails, And dishclouts stick eternal to our tails! Let George view ministers with surly looks, Abuse 'em, kick 'em—but revere his cooks!— ‘What, lose our locks!’—reply'd the roasting crew, To barbers yield 'em?—Damme if we do! Be shav'd like foreign dogs one daily meets, Naked and blue, and shiv'ring in the streets? And from the palace be asham'd to range,— For fear the world should think we had the mange; By taunting boys made weary of our lives, Broad grinning wh?es, and ridiculing wives!’ ‘Rouse, Opposition!’ roar'd a tipsey cook, With hands a-kimbo, and bubonic look: ‘'Tis she alone our noble curls can keep— Without her, ministers would fall asleep: 'Tis she who makes great men—our Foxes, Pitts, And sharpens, whet-stone like, the nation's wits: Knocks off your knaves and fools, however great, And, broom-like, sweeps the cobwebs of the state: In casks like sulphur that expels bad air, And makes, like thunder-claps, foul weather fair; Acts like a gun, that, fir'd at gather'd soot, Preserves the chimney, and the house to boot: Or, like a school-boy's whip, that keeps up tops, The sinking realm, by flagellation, props. Our monarch must not be indulg'd too far; Besides I love a little bit of war. Whether to crop our curls he boasts a right. Or not, I do not care the louse's bite; But then, no force-work! No! no force, by Heav'n? Cooks! yeomen! scourers! we will not be driv'n. Try but to force a pig against his will, Behold? the sturdy gentleman stands still! Or, p'rhaps (his pow'r to let the driver know) Gallops the very road he should not go— No force for me!—The French, the fawning dogs, E'en let them lose their freedom, and eat frogs— Damme! I hate each pale soupe-maigre thief— Give me my darling liberty and beef.’ He spoke—and from his jaws a lump he slid, And, swearing, manful flung to earth his quid. Then swelling pride forbade his tongue to rest, Whilst wild emotions labour'd in his breast— Now sounds confus'd his anger made him mutter, And, when he thought on shaving, curses sputter. Such is the sound (the simile's not weak) Form'd by what mortals bubble call, and squeak The modest author of the Lousiad must do himself the justice to declare here, that his simile of the bubble and squeak is vastly more natural and more sublime than Homer's black pudding on a gridiron, illustrating the motions and emotions of his hero Ulysses. (Vid. Odyssey.) When 'midst the frying-pan, in accents savage, The beef so surly quarrels with the cabbage. ‘Be shav'd!’ a scullion loud began to bellow, Loud as a parish bull, or poor Othello, Plac'd by that rogue Iago upon thorns, With all the horrors of a pair of horns: Loud as th' exciseman This affair happened a few years since—An exciseman seizing some smuggled goods belonging to a princess, a relation of the Great Frederick, her highness fell upon the poor rat de cave, and almost scratched his eyes out—the exciseman made a formal complaint to the king, begging to be relieved from the disgrace. The gallant monarch returned for answer, that he gave up the duties to his cousin the princess, but could not conceive how the hand of a fair Lady could dishonour the face of an exciseman., struggling for his life, And panting in a most inglorious strife; When on his face the smuggling princess sprung And, cat-like clawing, to his visage clung. ‘Be shav'd like pigs!’ rejoin'd the scullion's mate, His dishclout shaking, and his pot-crown'd pate— ‘What barber dares it, let him watch his nose And, curse me! dread the rage of these ten toes.’ So saying, with an oath to raise one's hair, He kick'd with threat'ning foot the yielding air. Thus have I seen an ass (baptiz'd a jack) Grac'd by a chimney-sweeper on his back, Prance, snort, and fling his heels with liberality, In imitation of a horse of quality. ‘Be shav'd!’ an understrapper turnbroche cry'd, In all the foaming energy of pride— ‘Zounds! let us take his majesty in hand! The king shall find he lives at our command: Yes; let him know, with all his wond'rous state, His teeth and stomach on our wills shall wait: We rule the platters, we command the spit, And George shall have his mess when we think fit; Stay till ourselves shall condescend to eat, And then, if we think proper, have his meat.’ Thus having fed on ven'son rather coarse, A colt, or crocodile, or dish of horse, The Tartar quits his smoaky hut with scorn, Sounds to the kingdoms of the world his horn: And treating monarchs like his slaves or swine, Informs them they have liberty to dine. ‘Heav'ns!’ cry'd a yeoman, with much learning grac'd, In books as well as meat, a man of taste, Who read with vast applause the daily news, And kept a close acquaintance with the Muse; Conundrums, rebus made—acrostic, riddle, And sung his dying sonnets to the fiddle, When Love, with cruel dart, the murd'ring thief! His heart had spitted, like a piece of beef: ‘Are these,’ he said, ‘of kings, the whims and jokes? Then kings can be as mad as common folks. Dame Nature, when a prince's head she makes, No more concern about the inside takes, Than of the inside of a bug's or bat's, A flea's, a grasshopper's, a cur's, a cat's! As careless as the artist, trunks designing, About the trifling circumstance of lining; Whether of Cumberland he use the plays, Miss Burney's novels, or Miss Seward's lays; Or sacred dramas of Miss Hannah More, Where all the Nine with little Moses, snore; Or good 'Squire Pindar's odes, or Warton's stick, Or Horace Walpole's doubts upon King Dick, Who furious drives, at times, his old goose quill, On Strawb'ry (reader) not th' Aonian Hill; Whether he doom the royal speech to cling, Or those of Lords and Commons to the King; Where one begs money, and the others grant So easy, freely, friendly, complaisant, As if the cash were really all their own, To purchase knick-knacks The Civil List, we are inclined to think, feels deficiencies from toys. For an instance we will appeal to Mr. Cumming's non-descript of a time-piece at the Queen's House, which cost nearly two thousand pounds. The same artist is also allowed 200l. per annum to keep the bauble in repair. that disgrace a throne. Ah, me! did people know what trifling things Compose those idols of the earth, called kings, Those counterparts of that important fellow, The children's wonder—Signor Punchinello; Who struts upon the stage his hour away; His outside, gold—his inside, rags and hay; No more as God's vicegerents would they shine, Nor make the world cut throats for right divine. ‘Those lords of earth, at dinner, we have seen, Sunk, by the merest trifles, with the spleen— Oft for an ill-dress'd egg have heard them groan, And seen them quarrel for a mutton bone: At salt or vinegar, with passion, fume, And kick dogs, chairs, and pages, round the room This is partly a picture of the last reign as well as the present. The passions of George the Second were of the most impetuous kind:—his hat and his favourite minister, Sir Robert Walpole, were too frequently the foot-balls of his ill humour—nay, poor Queen Caroline came in for a share of his foot benevolence—but he was a prince of virtues—ubi plura nitent, non ego paucis offendar maculis.. ‘Alas! how often have we heard them grunt, Whene'er the rushing rain hath spoil'd a hunt! Their sanguine wishes cross'd, their spirits clogg'd, Mere riding dishclouts homeward they have jogg'd; Poor imps! the sport (with all their pride and pow'r) Of nature's diuretic stream—a show'r! This we, the actors in the farce, perceive; But this the distant world will ne'er believe, Who fancy kings to all the virtues born, Ne'er by the vulgar storms of passion torn; But blest with souls so calm, like summer seas, That smile to heaven, unruffl'd by a breeze: Who think that kings, on wisdom always fed, Speak sentences like Bacon's brazen head; Hear from their lips the vilest nonsense fall, Yet think some heav'nly spirit dictates all; Conceive their bodies of celestial clay, And, though all ailment, sacred from decay; To nods and smiles their gaping homage bring, And thank their God their eyes have seen a king; Lord! in the circle when our royal master Pours out his words as fast as hail, or faster, To country 'squires, and wives of country 'squires; Like stuck pigs staring, how each oaf admires! Lo! ev'ry syllable becomes a gem! And if, by chance, the monarch cough, or hem, Seiz'd with the symptoms of a deep surprize, Their joints with rev'rence tremble, and their eyes Roll wonder first; then, shrinking back with fear, Would hide behind the brains, were any there. How taken is this idle world by show! Birth, riches, are the Baals to whom we bow; Preferring, with a soul as black as soot, A rogue on horseback, to a saint on foot. See France, see Portugal, Sicilia, Spain, And mark the desert of each despot's brain; Whose tongues should never treat with taunts a fool; Who prove that nothing is too mean to rule. What could the prince, high tow'ring like a steeple, Without the majesty of us the people? Go, like the king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar., to grass, Or wander, like a beggar with a pass! However modern kings may cooks despise, Warriors and kings were cooks, or hist'ry lies— Patroclus broil'd beef steaks to quell his hunger; The mighty Agamemnon potted conger!— And Charles of Sweden, 'midst his guns and drums, Spread his own bread and butter with his thumbs. Be shav'd!—No!—sooner pill'ries, jails, the stocks, Shall pinch this corpse, than barbers snatch my locks.’ ‘Well hast thou said,’ a scourer bold rejoin'd— ‘Damme! I love the man who speaks his mind.’ Then in his arms the orator he took, And swore he was an angel of a cook. Awhile he held him with a Cornish hug; Then seiz'd, with glorious grasp, a pewter mug, Whose ample womb nor cider held nor ale, But nectar fit for Jove, and brew'd by Thrale. ‘A health to cooks!’ he cry'd, and wav'd the pot, ‘And he who sighs for titles is a sot— Let dukes and lords the world in wealth surpass; Yet many a lion's skin conceals an ass. Lo! this is one amongst my golden rules, To think the greatest men the greatest fools: The great are judges of an opera song, And fly a Briton's for a eunuch's tongue; Thus idly squand'ring for a squawl their riches, To faint with rapture at those cats in breeches. Accept this truth from me, my lads—the man Who first found out a spit or frying-pan, Did ten times more towards the public good, Than all the tawdry titles since the flood: Titles! that kings may grant to asses, mules, The scorn of sages, and the boast of fools.’ He ended—All the cooks exclaim'd, ‘Divine!’ Then whisper'd one another, 'twas ‘damn'd fine!’ Thus spoke the scourer like a man inspir'd, Whose speech the heroes of the kitchen fir'd: Grooms, master scourers, scullions, scullions' mates, With all the overseers of knives and plates, Felt their brave souls like frisky cider work, Whizzing in opposition to the cork: Earth's potentates appear'd ignoble things, And cooks of greater consequence than kings. Such is the pow'r of words, where truth unites, And such the rage that injur'd worth excites! The scourer's speech, indeed, with reason blest, Inflam'd with godlike ardour all the rest: Thus if a barn heav'n's vengeful lightning draw, The flame ethereal darts amongst the straw; Doors, rafters, beams, owls, weazels, mice, and rats, And (if unfortunately mousing) cats; All feel the fierce devouring fire in turn, And mingling in one conflagration, burn. ‘Sons of the spit,’ the major cry'd again, ‘Your noble speeches prove you blest with brain; Brain! that Dame Nature gives not ev'ry head, But fills the vast vacuity with lead!— Yet ere for opposition we prepare, And fight the glorious cause of heads of hair, Methinks 'twould be but decent to petition, And tell the king, with firmness, our condition: Soon as our sad complaint he hears us utter, His gracious heart may melt away like butter; Fair mercy shine amidst our gloomy house, And anger'd majesty forget the Louse.’ADVERTISEMENT. AS many people persist in their incredulity with respect to the attack made by the barbers, on the heads of the harmless cooks, I shall exhibit a list of the unhappy sufferers; it is the Palace list, and therefore as authentic as the Gazette. A true List of the Shaved at Buckingham House. Two master cooks Three yeoman ditto Four grooms Three children Two master scourers Six under scourers Six turnbroches Two soil-carriers Two door-keepers Eight boys Five pastry people Eight silver scullery, for laughing at the cooks. In all, fifty-one. A young man, named John Bear, would not submit, and lost his place. CANTO II. ‘?

Nymphs of the sacred fount, around whose brink Bards rush in droves, like cart-horses, to drink; Dip their dark beards amidst your streams so clear, And, whilst they gulp it, wish it ale or beer; Far more delighted to possess, I ween, Old Calvert's Brewhouse for their Hippocrene; And blest with beef, their ghostly forms to fill, Make Dolly's chophouse their Aonian hill; More pleas'd to hear knives, forks, in concert join, Than all the tinkling cymbals of the Nine; Assist me—ye who themes sublime pursue, With scarce a shift, a stocking, or a shoe! Such pow'r have satires, epigrams, and odes, As make ev'n bankrupts of the born of gods, As well as mortal bards, who oft bewail Their unsuccessful madrigals in jail, Where penn'd, like hapless cuckows, in a cage, The ragged warblers pour their tuneful rage; Deck the damp walls with verse of various quality, And, from their prisons, mount to immortality. Ah! tell me where is now thy blush, O Shame! Shall bards through jails explore the road to fame? Like souls of papists in their way to glory, Doom'd at the half-way house, call'd Purgatory, To burn, before they reach the realms of light, Like old tobacco-pipes, from black to white? Yet let me say again, that pow'rful rhime Hath lifted poets to a state sublime; To lofty pill'ries rais'd their sacred ears High o'er the heads of marvelling compeers, Whose eggs, potatoes, turnips and their tops, Paid flying homage to their tuneful chops! Blest state! that gives each fair exalted mien, To grace in print a monthly magazine; And deck the shops with sweet engravings drest, 'Midst angels, sinners, saints of Mr. West; Where brave King Alexander and the Deer, A noble bustling hodge-podge shall appear, From that fam'd picture A whole acre of canvass so daubed by colour as to give it the appearance of a brass foundry. which our wonder drew, And pour'd its brazen splendours on the view; Bright as the pictures that with glorious glare, On pent-house high, in Piccadilly stare, Where lions seem to roar, and tigers growl, Hyænas whine, and wolves in concert howl; And, by their goggling eyes and furious grin, Inform what shaggy devils lodge within. Ye Nymphs who, fond of fun, full many a time, Mount on a jack-ass many a child of rhime, And make him think, astride his braying hack, He moves sublime on Pegasus's back: Ye Muses, oft by brainless poets sought To bid the stanza chime, and swell with thought: Who, whelping for oblivion, fain would save Their whining puppies from the sullen wave; Assist me! ye who visit towns and hovels, To teach our girls in bibs to eke out novels, And treat with scorn (far nobler knowledge studying) The humbler art of making pie or pudding: Who make our Sapphos of their verses vain, And fancy all Parnassus in their brain; And, 'midst the bustle of their lucubrations, Take downright madness for your inspirations; Charm'd with the cadence of a lucky line, Who taste a rapture equal, George to thine; When, blest at Datchet, thro' thy Herschell's glass, That brings from distant worlds a horse, an ass, A tree, a windmill, to the curious eye, Shirts, stockings, blankets, that on hedges dry, Thine eyes, at evenings late, and mornings soon, Unsated feast on wonders in the moon; Where Herschell on volcanoes, mountains, pores, And happy nature's true sublime explores; Whilst thou, so modest (wonderful to tell!) On lunar trifles art content to dwell, Flies, grasshoppers, grubs, cobwebs, cuckow spittle In short, delighted with the world of little; Which West shall paint, and grave Sir Joseph Banks Receive from thy historic mouth with thanks; Then bid the vermin on the journals Of the Royal Society. crawl, Hop, jump, and flutter, to amuse us all. And thou, great Patron Apollo. of the double quill, That flays by rhime, and murders by a pill, A pretty kind of double-barrel'd gun, More giv'n to tragedy than comic fun; Auspicious Patron of the paunch and backs Of those all-daring rascals christen'd quacks, To whom our purse and lives are legal plunder, Who, hawk-like, keep the human species under: God of those gentlemen of gingling brains, Who, for their own amusement, print their strains; Strains that ne'er soar'd beyond the beetle's flight, Save on the pinions of a school-boy's kite; Strains arrant strangers to a depth profound, Save when deep pilgrimaging under ground, In humble rags, like tinners in a mine, They pay their court to Cloacina's shrine; Strains that no ray of light nor warmth proclaim, Save when, committed to the fire, they flame; Strains that a circulation never found, Save when they turn'd on beef or ven'son round: Oh! aid, as lofty Homer says, my nouse, To sing sublime the Monarch and the Louse! Nymphs, Phœbus, in my first heroic chapter I should have pray'd for crumbs of tuneful rapture: Thus to forget my friends was not so clever; But, says the proverb, ‘better late than never.’ Well! since I'm in the invocation trade, To Conscience let my compliments be paid— Conscience, a terrifying little sprite, That, bat-like, winks by day, and wakes by night; Hunts thro' the heart's dark holes each lurking vice, As sharp as weasels hunting eggs or mice; Who, when the lightnings flash, and thunders crack, Makes our hair bristle like a hedge-hog's back; Shakes, ague-like, our hearts with wild commotion; Uplifts our saint-like eyes with dread devotion; Bids the poor trembling tongue make terms with Heav'n, And promise miracles to be forgiv'n; Bid spectres rise, not very like the Graces, With goggling eyes, black-beards, and Tyburn faces; With scenes of fires of glowing brimstone scares, Spits, forks, and proper culinary wares, For roasting, broiling, frying, fricasseeing The soul, that sad offending little being; That stubborn stuff, of salamander make, Proof to the fury of the burning lake: O Conscience! thou strait jacket of the soul, The madding sallies of the bard control; Who, when inclin'd, like brother bards, to lie, Bring Truth's neglected form before his eye; Fair maid! to towns and courts a stranger grown, And now to rural swains almost unknown, Whose company was once their prudent choice; Who once, delighted listen'd to her voice; When in their hearts the gentler passion strove, And Constancy went hand in hand with Love! Sweet Truth, who steals through lonely shades along, And mingles with the turtle's note her song; Whilst Falsehood, rais'd by sycophantic tricks: Unblushing, flaunts it in a coach and six: Conscience! who bid'st our monarch, from the nation, Send sons to Gottingen for education, Since helpless Cam and Isis, lost to knowledge, Are idiots to this Hanoverian college, Where simple science beams with orient ray; The great, the glorious Athens of the day! So says the ruler of us English fools, Who cannot judge like him of Wisdom's schools. Dear attic Gottingen! to thee I bow, Of knowledge, oh! most wonderful milch cow! From whom huge pails the royal boys shall bring, And give, we hope, a little to the ?. Through thee, besides the knowledge they may reap, The lads shall get their board and lodging cheap And learn, like their good parents to subsist Within the limits of the Civil List; Who seldom bid a minister implore A little farther pittance for the poor! Conscience! who, to the wonder of his sire, Bad'st from his wonted state a prince retire, And, like a subject, humbly seek the shade, That not a tradesman might remain unpaid: An action that the soul of Envy stings— A deed unmention'd in the book of Kings: Conscience! who mad'st a monarch, by thy pow'r, Send pris'ner the fam'd di'mond Such is the story of the late sly bulse that stole into St. James's. to the Tow'r; So witchingly that look'd him in the face, And impudently sought to bribe his grace: Where, too, the cradle and the bed shall rest, That on the same damn'd errand left the East— Thus fall of gem and pearl the treas'nous tribe, And beds and cradles that would monarchs bribe! Conscience! who now canst like a cart-horse draw; Now, lifeless sinking, scarcely lift a straw; So different are thy pow'rs at diff'rent times, Thou dear companion of the man of rhimes! Thou! who at times canst like a lion roar For one poor sixpence; yet, like North, canst snore, Though rapine, murder, try to ope thine eyes, And raging Hell with all his horrors rise; Whose eye on petty frauds can fiercely flame, Yet wink at full-blown crimes that blast a name! O Conscience! who didst bid to madness work (So great thy pow'r) the brain of hapless Yorke, And mad'st him cut from ear to ear his throat, That luckless spoil'd his patriotic note; Yet wantedst strength to force from his hard eye One drop—who help'd him to yon spangled sky; Whose damned pray'rs, feign'd tears, and tongue of art Won on the weakness of his honest heart! Poor Yorke! without a stone whose reliques lie, Though Virtue mark'd the murder with a sigh! O Conscience! who to Clive didst give the knife That, desp'rate plunging, took his forfeit life; Who, lawless plund'rer, in his wild career, Whelm'd Asia's eye with woe, and heart with fear Whose wheels on carnage roll'd, and, drench'd with blood, From gasping nature forc'd the blushing flood; Whilst Havock, panting with triumphant breath, Nerv'd his red arm, and hail'd the hills of death.— And now to thee, O lovely Fame, I bend; Let all thy trumpets this great work commend; Give one apiece to all the learn'd Reviews, And bid them sound the labours of the Muse: Give to the Magazines a trumpet each, And let the swelling note to doomsday reach: To daily news-papers a trumpet give: Thus shall my epic strain for ever live: Thus shall my book descend to distant times, And rapt posterity resound my rhimes. By future beauties shall each tome be prest, And, like their lapdogs live a parlour guest. Thee, dearest Fame, some mercenaries hail, Merely to gain their labours a good sale; Or rise to fair preferment by thy tongue, Though deaf as adders to thy charms of song; Just as the hypocrites say pray'rs, sing psalms, Bestow upon the blind and cripple alms; Yield glory to the Pow'r who rules above, Not from a principle of heav'nly love, But, sneaking rascals! to obtain—when dead— A comfortable lodging over head, When, forc'd by age, or doctors, or their spouses, The vagrants quit their sublunary houses. With tiresome invocation having done, At length our glorious epic may go on.— Lo! Madam Schwellenberg, inclin'd to cram, Was wondrous busy o'er a plate of ham; A ham that once adorn'd a German pig, Rough as a bear, and as a jack-ass big; In woods of Westphaly by hunters smitten, And sent a present to the queen of Britain. But ere we farther march, ye Muses say, Somewhat of Madam Schwellenberg, I pray:— If ancient poets mention but a horse, We read his genealogy of course: Oh! say, shall horses boast the deathless line; And o'er a lady's lineage sleep the Nine? By virtue of her father and her mother, This woman saw the light without much pother; That is,—no grand commotions shook our earth— Apollo danc'd no hornpipe at her birth, To say to what perfection she was born, What wit, what wisdom should the nymph adorn: No bees around her lips in clusters hung, To tell the future sweetness of her tongue; Around her cradle perch'd no cooing dove, To mark the soul of innocence and love; No smiling Cupids round her cradle play'd, To show the future conquests of the maid; Whose charms would make the jealous sex her foes, And with their lightnings blast a thousand beaus. Indeed the Muse must own a trifling pother Sprung up between the father and the mother; For after taking methods how to gain her, They knew not how the dev'l they should maintain her. Heav'ns! what! no prodigy attend her birth, Who awes the greatest palace upon earth? Yes!—a black cat around the bantling squall'd, Join'd its young cries, and all the house appall'd: Now here, now there, he sprung with visage wild, And made a bold attempt to kiss the child; Bats pour'd in hideous hosts into the room, And, imp-like, flitting, form'd a sudden gloom; Then to the cradle rush'd the dark'ning throng, And, raptur'd, shriek'd congratulating song; Which song, in concert with the squalls of puss, Seem'd, in plain German, ‘Thou art one of us.’ In Strelitz first this dame the light espy'd, Born to a good inheritance of pride; For, howe'er paradoxical it be, Pride pigs with people of a low degree, As well as with your folks of fortune struts; Like rats that live in palaces or huts; Or bugs, an animal of pompous gait, That dwell in beds of straw or beds of state; Or monkeys vile, whose tooth inglorious grapples, Now with ananas, now with rotten apples. Hail, Proteus Pride, whose various powers of throat Can swell the trumpet's loud and saucy note; And if a meaner air can serve thy turn, In panting, quiv'ring sounds of Jews'-harps, mourn! Hail, Pride, companion of the great and little, So abject, who canst lick a patron's spittle; Whine like a sneaking puppy at his door, And turn the hind part of thy wig before; Nay, if he orders, turn it inside out, And wear it, merry-andrew like, about; Heed not the grinning world a single rush, But bear its pointed scorn without a blush. Yet fain wouldst thou the crouching world bestride, Just like the Rhodian Bully o'er the tide; The brazen wonder of the world of yore, That proudly stretch'd his legs from shore to shore, And saw of Greece the loftiest navy travel, In dread submission underneath his navel. So much for pride—great, little, humble, vain; And now for Madam Schwellenberg again. Whether the nymph could ever boast a grace, That deign'd to pay a visit to her face, The Muse is ignorant, she must allow; Yet knows this truth, that not one sparkles now. If ever beauties, in delight excelling, Charm'd on her cheek, they long have left their dwelling. This nymph a mantuamaker was, I ween, And priz'd for cheapness by our saving queen, Who (where's the mighty harm of loving money?) Brought her to this fair land of milk and honey, And plac'd her in a most important sphere— Inspectress General of the royal geer. Soon as this woman heard the Louse's tale, At once she turn'd, like walls of plaster pale. But first the ham of Westphaly she gobbled, And then to seek the Lord's Anointed hobbled: Him full of wrath, like Peleus' son of yore, When Agamemnon took away his w?, In all the bitterness of wrath she found; The queen and royal children staring round. ‘O Swelly!—thus the madden'd monarch roar'd, Whilst wild impatience wing'd each rapid word; For, lo! the solemn march of graceful speech, The king long since had bid to kiss his b?h. The broken language that his mouth affords Are heads and tails, and legs and wings of words, That give imagination's laughing eye A lively picture of a giblet pie. ‘O Swelly, Swelly!’ cry'd the furious king, ‘What! what a dirty, filthy, nasty thing!— That thus you come to ease my angry mind, Indeed is very, very, very, very kind.— What's your opinion, hæ!’—the monarch rav'd: ‘Yes, yes, the cooks shall ev'ry one be shav'd— What! what! hæ! hæ! now tell me, Swelly, pray, Shan't I be right in't—What! what! Swelly, hæ? Yes, yes, I'm sure on't, by the Louse's looks, That he belong'd to some one of the cooks.— Speak, Swelly; shan't we shave each filthy jowl? Yes, yes, and that we will, upon my soul.’ To whom the dame, with elevated chin, Wide-staring eyes, and broad, contemptuous grin: ‘Yes, sure as dat my soul is to be sav'd, So sure de dirty rascals sal be shav'd— Shav'd to de quick be ev'ry moder's son— And curse me if I do not see it done: De barbers soon der nasty locks sal fall on, Nor leave one standing for a louse to crawl on. If on der skulls de razor do not shine, May gowns and petticoats no more be mine— Curl, club, and pigtail, all sal go to pot, For such curs'd nastiness, or I'll be rot; Or else to Strelitz let me quickly fly, Dat dunghill, dat poor pighouse to de eye; Where from his own mock trone de prince, so great, Can jomp into another prince estate— Yes, by de God dat made dis eart and me, No single lousy rascal sal go free.’ Reader, thou raisest both thy marv'lling eyes, In all the staring wildness of surprise; As if the poet did not truth revere, And fanciest gentlewomen could not swear: Go, fool, and seek the ladies of the mud, Queens of the lakes, or damsels of the flood, Nymphs, Nereids, or what vulgar tongues call drabs, Who vend at Billingsgate their sprats and crabs; Tell them their fish all stink, and thou wilt hear Whether fine gentlewomen ever sweare: Nay, visit many of our courtly dames, When wrath their dove-like gentleness inflames; Lo! thou shalt find, by many a naughty word, They use small ceremony with the Lord, In spite of all that godly books contain, That teach them not to take his name in vain. ‘Thanks, Swelly, thanks, thanks, thanks,’ the king reply'd; ‘Like me you have not got a grain of pride.— Yes, yes, if I am master of this house— Yes, yes, the locks shall fall, and then the Louse.’ He spoke, and to confirm the dreadful doom, His head he shook, that shook the dining room. Thus Jove, of old, the dread, the thund'ring god, Shook, when he swore, Olympus with his nod. ‘Yes,’ cry'd the king—‘yes, yes, their curls shall quake— But tell me, where, where, where's Sir Francis Drake?’ O, reader, think not 'twas that Drake, Sir Francis, Whose wondrous actions seem almost romances; Who shone in sense profound, and bloodiest wars, And rais'd the nation's glory to the stars; Who first in triumph sail'd around the world, And vengeance on the foes of Britain hurl'd; But he who sculks around the royal kitchen, Which if he catch a neighbour's dog or bitch in, Lets fly, to strike the four-legg'd mumper dead, A poker, or a cleaver, at his head. Not that Sir Francis Drake who, god-like, bore Fair freedom, science to th' Atlantic shore; To Pagans gave the Gospel's saving grace, And planted virtue midst a barb'rous race; Spread on the darken'd realms the blaze of light— But he who sees the spoons and plates are bright; Sees that the knives before the king and queen Are, like the pair of royal stomachs, keen: Not he, whose martial frown whole kingdoms shook, But he whose low'ring visage shakes a cook: Not he who pour'd on Mexico his tars, But he, at London, who with linen wars, Napkins and damask tablecloths It was a common practice, in the last and preceding reigns, to tear and cut the royal linen privately, which, on account of the teeth, knife, nail, or scissar wounds, were never more used, but went as perquisites to treasurers and masters of the household. assails With scissars, razors, knives, and teeth, and nails; Who dares with Doylies desp'rate war to wage, Such is his province and domestic rage, If, like his predecessors, he hath grace, And calls his conquests, perquisites of place.— 'Twas not that Drake who bade his daring crew Run with their bayonets the Spaniards through; But that important Drake, in office big, Instructing cooks to spit a goose or pig: Not he who took the Spaniards by the nose, And prisons fill'd with Britain's graceless foes; But he who bids the geese, his pris'ners, die, And stuffs their leggs and gizzards in a pie: He who, three times a week, a green-cloth lord, Sits, wisdom-fraught, at that important board With wise compeers, in judge-like order studying, Whether the king shall have a tart or pudding. Not he, by virtues to the world endear'd, By foes respected, and by friends rever'd; Prompt to relieve the supplicating sigh, Who never dash'd with tears the asking eye; But wak'd of joy the long departed beam, Deep sunk in sorrow's unremitting stream: But he, with greatness at eternal strife, Who never gave a sixpence in his life; Who, if he ever ask'd a friend to dine, Requested favours that outweigh'd his wine; From lane to lane, who steals with wary feet; Just like the cautious hare that seeks his seat: Who, though a city Exeter. near him rears her head, And wealthy villages around him spread, No friend, no neighbour near his mansion found; Like Cain he walks in solitude around. 'Twas this Sir Francis, quite a diff'rent man From him who round the world with glory ran: Forbid it Heav'n! that e'er the Muse untrue Should give to any man another's due! Muse, leave we now the monarch, vengeance brewing, To take a peep at what the cooks were doing. In that snug room, The larder. the scene of shrewd remark, Whose window stares upon the saunt'ring park; Where many a hungry bard, and gambling sinner, In chop-fall'n sadness, counts the trees for dinner In that snug room where any man of spunk Would find it a hard matter to get drunk; This will be deemed strange by my country readers—but it is nevertheless true. Where coy Tokay ne'er feels a cooks embraces, Nor port nor claret show their rosy faces; But where old Adam's beverage flows with pride, From wide-mouth'd pitchers, in a plenteous tide; Where veal, pork, mutton, beef, and fowl, and fish, All club their joints to make one handsome dish; Where stew-pan covers serve for plates, I ween, And knives and forks and spoons are never seen; Where pepper issues from a paper bag, And for a cruet stands a brandy cag; Where Madam Schwellenberg too often sits, Like some old tabby in her mousing fits, Demurely squinting with majestic mien, To catch some fault to carry to the queen: In that snug room, like those immortal Greeks, Of whom, in book the thirteenth, Ovid speaks— Around the table, all with sulky looks, Like culprits doom'd to Tyburn, sat the cooks: At length, with phiz that show'd the man of woes, The sorrowing king of spits and stew-pans rose; Like Paul at Athens, very justly sainted, And by the charming brush of Raphael painted, With out-stretch'd hands, and energetic grace, He fearless thus harangues the roasting race; Whilst gaping round, in mute attention, sit, The poor forlorn disciples of the spit: ‘Cooks, scullions, hear me ev'ry mother's son— Know that I relish not this royal fun: George thinks us scarcely fit ('tis very clear) To carry guts, my brethren, to a bear.’— ‘Guts to a bear!’ the cooks, up-springing, cry'd— ‘Guts to a bear,’ the major loud reply'd. ‘Guts to the dev'l!’ loud roar'd the cooks again, And toss'd their noses high in proud disdain: The plain translation of whose pointed noses The reader needeth not, the bard supposes; But if the reason some dull reader looks, 'Tis this—whatever kings may think of cooks, Howe'er crown'd heads may deem them low-born things, Cooks are possess'd of souls as well as kings. Yet are there some who think (but what a shame!) Poor people's souls like pence of Birmingham, Adulterated brass—base stuff—abhorr'd— That never can pass current with the Lord; And think because of wealth they boast a store, With ev'ry freedom they may treat the poor: Witness the story that my Muse, with tears, Relates, O reader, to thy shrinking ears: With feeble voice and deep desponding sighs, With sallow cheek and pity-asking eyes, A wretch, by age and poverty decay'd, For farthings lately to a nabob pray'd; The nabob, turkey-like, began to swell, And damn'd the beggar to the pit of hell. ‘Oh! Sir,’ the supplicant was heard to cry (The tear of mis'ry trickling from his eye), ‘Though I'm in rags, and wondrous, wondrous poor, And you with gold and silver cover'd o'er, There won't in heav'n such difference take place, When we before the Lord come face to face.’— ‘You face to face with me!’ the nabob cry'd, In all the insolence of upstart pride:— ‘You face to face with me, you dog, appear! Damme, I'll kick you, if I catch you there.’— Oh, shocking blasphemy! oh, horrid speech! Where was the fellow born? the wicked wretch!— So black an imp would pull, I do suppose, A bulse of di'monds from a Begum's nose; Or make, like Doulah, careless of his soul, A new edition of the old Black Hole. ‘What's life,’ the major said, ‘my brethren, pray, If force must snatch our first delights away? Relentless shall the royal mandate drag The hairs that long have grac'd this silken bag; Hairs to a barber scarcely worth a fig, Too few to make a foretop for a wig? Must razors vile these locks, so scanty, shave, Locks that I wish to carry to my grave; Hairs, look, my lads, so wonderfully thin, Old Schwellenberg hath more upon her chin?’ ‘Yes, that she hath,’ exclaim'd a cook, ‘by G?d, A damn'd old German good-for-nothing toad.’ ‘Yes, yes, her mouth with beard divinely bristles— Curse me, I'd rather kiss a bunch of thistles, Oh! were it but his majesty's commands To give her gentle jawbones to these hands, I'd shave her, like a punish'd soldier, dry— I'd pay my compliments to madam's chin— I'll answer for't I'd make the devil grin— The razor most deliciously should work— I'd trim her muzzle—yes, I'd scrape her pork— I'd teach her to some purpose to behave, And show the witch the nature of a shave— O! woman, woman! whether lean or fat, In face an angel, but in soul a cat!’ He ended—when each mouth upon the stretch, Crown'd with a loud horse-laugh the classic speech. Too soon, alas! Resentment seiz'd the hour, And Joke resign'd his grin-provoking pow'r; Rage dimn'd of mirth the sudden sunny sky, And fill'd with gloomy oaths each scowling eye; Whilst Grief, returning, took her turn to reign, Sunk every heart, and sadden'd ev'ry mien;— Drew from their giddy heights the laughing graces— For much is grief dispos'd to bring down faces. ‘Son of the spit,’ the major, strutting, cry'd, ‘I like thy spirit, and revere thy pride: I'd rather hear thee than a bishop preach, For thou hast made a very pretty speech. Such is the language that the gods should hear, And such should thunder on the royal ear. Yet, son of dripping, tho' thou speak'st my notions, We must not be too nimble in our motions— Awhile, heroic brothers, let us halt: Soft fires, the proverb tells us, make sweet malt. And yet again I bid you stand like rocks, And battle for the honour of your locks. Lo! in these aged hairs is all my joy— To shave them, is my being to destroy. What's life, if life has not a bliss to give?— And, if unhappy, who would wish to live? Content can visit the poor spider'd room; Pleas'd with the coarse rush mat and birchen broom; Where parents, children, feast on oaten bread, With cheeks as round as apples, and as red; Where health with vigour nerves their backs and hams, Sweet souls, though ragged as young colts or rams; Where calmly sleep the parents with their darlings, Though nibbled by the fleas as thick as starlings; Lull'd to their rest, beneath the coarsest rugs, And dead to bitings of a thousand bugs. Content, mild maid! delights in simple things, And envies not the state of queens or kings; Can dine on sheep's head, or a dish of broth, Without a table or a tablecloth; Nor wishes, with the fashionable group, To visit Horton's shop for turtle soup: Can use a bit of packthread for a jack, And sit upon a chair without a back: Nay, wanting knives, can with her fingers work, And use a wooden skewer for a fork. Sweet maid! who thinks not shoes of leather shocking, Nor feels the horrors in a worsted stocking; Her temper mild, no huckaback can shock, Though for her lovely limbs it forms a smock: Pleas'd with the nat'ral curls her face that shade, No graves are robb'd for hair to form a braid: Her breast of native plumpness ne'er aspires To swelling merry thoughts of gauze and wires, To look like crops of ducks (with labour born) Stretch'd by a superfluity of corn. With nature's hips, she sighs not for cork rumps, And scorns the pride of pinching stays or jumps; But, pleas'd from whalebone prisons to escape, She trusts to simple nature for a shape; Without a warming-pan can go to bed, And wrap her petticoat about her head; Nor sigh for cobweb caps of Mechlin lace, That shade of quality the varnish'd face: Sweet nymph, like doves, she seeks her straw-built nest, And in a pair of minutes is undrest; Whilst all the fashionable female clans, Undressing, seem unloading caravans. No matter from what source contentment springs; 'Tis just the same in cooks as 'tis in kings; And if our souls are set upon our hair, Let snip-snap barbers, nay, let kings beware, Nor tempt the dangerous rage of true John Bulls, And clap, like fools, the edge-tool to our skulls. Tread on a worm, he shows his rage and pain, By turning on the wounding toe again; Nay, ev'n inanimates appear to feel:— On the loose stone, if chance direct your heel, Lo! from its womb the sudden stream ascends To prove the foot was not among its friends; And calling in the aid of neighbour mud, O'er the fair stocking spouts the sable flood.’ So spoke the major, with resentment fir'd— Spoke like a man—indeed, like man inspir'd.— Some critic cries, with sharp, fastidious look, ‘Bard, bard, this is not language for a cook.’— O snarler! but I'll lay thee any wager, It is not too sublime for a cook-major. ‘Behold! to remedy our sad condition,’ The major cry'd, ‘I've cook'd up a petition: This carries weight with it, or I'm mistaken, Shall shake the monarch's soul, and save our bacon.’ Then jumping on a barrel, thus aloud He read sonorous to the gaping crowd. Thus reads a parish-clerk in church a brief, That begs for burnt-out wretches kind relief— Relief, alas! that very rarely reaches The poor petitioners, the ruin'd wretches; But (lost its way) unfortunately steers To fat churchwardens and fat overseers; Improves each dish, augments the punch and ale, And adds new spirit to the smutty tale. THE PETITION OF THE COOKS. ‘Your majesty's firm friends and faithful cooks, Who in your palace merry liv'd as grigs, Have heard, with heavy hearts and down-cast looks, That we must all be shav'd, and put on wigs: You, sire, who with such honour wear your crown, Should never bring on ours disgraces down. Dread sir! we really deem our heads our own, With ev'ry sprig of hair that on them springs:— In France, where men like spaniels lick the throne, And count it glory to be cuff'd by kings, Their locks belong unto the Grand Monarque, Who swallows privileges like a shark. Be pleas'd to pardon what we now advance;— We dare your sacred majesty assure, That there's a diff'rence between us and France; And long, we hope, that diff'rence will endure. We know King Lewis would, with pow'r so dread, Not only cut the hair off, but the head. Oh! tell us, sir, in loyalty so true, What dire designing raggamuffins said, That we, your cooks, are such a nasty crew, Great sir! as to have crawlers in our head? My liege, you can't find one through all our house,— Not if you'd give a guinea for a louse. What creature 'twas you found upon your plate We know not—if a louse, it was not ours:— To shave each cook's poor unoffending pate, Betrays too much of arbitrary pow'rs;— The act humanity and justice shocks:— Let him who owns the crawler lose his locks. But grant upon your plate this louse so dread, How can you say, sir, it belongs to us? Maggots are found in many a princely head; And if a maggot, why then not a louse? Nay, grant the fact;—with horror should you shrink? It could not eat your majesty, we think. Hunger, my liege, hath oft been felt by kings, As well as people of inferior state;— Quarrels with cooks are therefore dangerous things— We cannot answer for your stomach's fate; For, by your size, we frankly must declare, You feed on more substantial stuff than air. My liege, a universe hath been your foes: The times have look'd most miserably black— America hath try'd to pull your nose— French, Dutch, and Spaniards, try'd to bang your back: 'Twould be a serious matter, we can tell ye, Were we to buccaneer it on your belly. You see the spirit of your cooks, then, sire— Determin'd nobly to support their locks; And should your guards be order'd out to fire, Their guns may be oppos'd by spits and crocks: Knives, forks, and spoons, may fly, with plates a store, And all the thunder of the kitchen roar. Nat. Gardner, yeoman of the mouth, declares He'll join the standard of your injur'd cooks— Each scullion, turn broche, for redress prepares, And puts on very formidable looks: Your women too—imprimis, Mistress Dyer, Whose eggs are good as ever felt a fire: Next sweeper-general Bickley, Mistress Mary, With that fam'd bell-ringer, call'd Mistress Loman— Ann Spencer, guardian of the necessary, That is to say, the necessary woman— All these, an't please you, sir, so fierce, determine To join us in the cause of hair and vermin. There's Mistress Stewart, Mister Richard Day, Who find your sacred majesty in linen, Are ready to support us in our fray— You can't conceive the passion they have been in; They swear so much your scheme of shaving hurts, You shan't have pocket-handkerchiefs or shirts. The grocers, Clark and Taylor, curse the scheme, And say, whate'er we do, the world won't blame us— So Comber says who gives you milk and cream— And thus your old friend Mister Lewis Ramus: We think your sacred majesty would mutter At loss of sugar, milk, and cream and butter. Suppose, an't please you, sir, that Mistress Knutton And Mistress Maishfield, fierce as tiger cats; One overseer of all the beef and mutton, The other lady president of sprats— Suppose, in opposition to your wish, This locks away the flesh, and that the fish? Suppose John Clarke refuse supplies of mustard, So necessary to your beef and bacon Will Roberts, all the apple-pie and custard? Your majesty would growl, or we're mistaken.— Suppose that Wells, to plague your stomach studying, From Sunday, sacrilegious, steals the pudding? Suppose that Rainsforth with our corps unites; We mean the man who all the tallow handles— Suppose he locks up all the mutton lights— How could your majesty contrive for candles You'd be (excuse the freedom of remark) Like some administrations—in the dark. We dare assure you that our grief is great— And oft, indeed, our feelings it enrages, To see your sacred majesty beset By such a graceless gang of idle pages— And, with submission to your judgment, sire, We think old Madam Schwellenberg a liar. Suppose, great sir, that by your cruel fiat, The barbers should attack our humble head, And that we should not choose to breed a riot, Because we might not wish to lose our bread; Say, would the triumph o'er each harmless cook Make George the Third like Alexander look? Dread sir, reflect on Johnny Wilkes's fate, Supported chiefly by a paltry rabble— Wilkes bade defiance to your frowns and state, And got the better in that famous squabble; Poor was the victory you wish'd to win, That set the mouth of Europe on the grin. O king, our wives are in the kitchen roaring, All ready in rebellion now to rise— They mock our humble method of imploring, And bid us guard against a wig surprise:— ‘Yours is the hair,’ they cry'd, ‘th' Almighty gave ye, And not a king in Christendom should shave ye.’ Lo! on th' event the world impatient looks, And thinks the joke is carried much too far— Then pray, sir, listen to your faithful cooks, Nor in the palace breed a civil war: Loud roars our band, and, obstinate as pigs, Cry, ‘Locks and liberty, and damn the wigs!’ CANTO III. Magnum iter ascendo, sed dat mihi gloria vires— Non juvat ex facili lecta corona jugo. PROPERTIUS. Bold is th' ascent, but glory nerves my pow'rs I like to pick on precipices, flow'rs. THE ARGUMENT.

Night, like a widow in her weeds of woe, Had gravely walk'd for hours our world below: Hobgoblins, spectres in her train, and cats; Owls round her hooting, mix'd with shrieking bats, Like wanton Cupids in th' Idalian grove, That flick'ring sport around the Queen of Love. Now like our quality, who darkling rise, Each star had op'd its fashionable eyes; Too proud to make appearance, too well bred, Till Sol, the vulgar wretch, had gone to bed. His wisdom dead to sublunary things, In leaden slumber snor'd the best of ?????; In slumber lifeless, with seraphic mien, Close at his back, too, snor'd his gentle ?????: Unlike the pair of modern days, that weds, And, in one fortnight, bawls for different beds! Blest imp! now Morpheus o'er each princess stole, And clos'd those radiant eyes that vainly roll! Eyes! love's bright stars! but doom'd in vain to shine; For, ah! what youth shall say, ‘those orbs are mine:’ Then, what are eyes, alas! the brightest eyes, Forbid to languish on a lover's sighs The pouting lip, the soft luxuriant breast, If coldly fated never to be press'd? Ah, vainly those like dew-clad cherries glow; And this as vainly vies with Alpine snow! The breath that gives of Araby the gales, The voice that sounds enchantment, what avails? The Juno form, the purple bloom of May, Gifts of the Graces, all are thrown away! But, possibly, some German duke may move, And make a tendre of his heavy love! His wide dominions—miles, p'rhaps, nine or ten; His Myrmidonian phalanx—fifty men! But, lo! his heart, the fount whence honour springs, Swell'd with the richest blood of ancient kings! He comes! not for high birth, his own before! Great duke! he comes to woo our golden ore, And add (how truly happy Britain's fate!) Another leech to suck the sanguine state; To join (composing what a goodly row!) The place-broker, old Schw? and Co. Now Morpheus (in compassion to mankind, Made, by his magic, deaf, and dumb, and blind) Amus'd with dreams man's ambulating soul, To recompense him for the time he stole; Bade the beau dance, his Delia melt away, Who box'd his ears so cruel through the day. Of ancient damsels eas'd the lovesick pains, Brought back lost charms, and fill'd their laps with swains; Gave placid cuckoldom a constant dame; To brainless authors, bread and cheese and fame; Made driv'ling monarchs schemes of wisdom plan, And nature's rankest coward kill his man; Gave to the chap-fall'n courtier wealth and power, Who felt no favour at the levee-hour, Though tip-toed, hawk-like, watchful all the while, To seize the faintest glimpse of royal smile; Bade happy aldermen assume new airs, Be-chain'd with all the splendor of lord may'rs; And bade them too (without a groat to pay) Re-gobble all the turtle of the day: Bade Gl?r think his might could match a mouse, And Chambers fancy he could build a house; And Lady Mount, th' antipodes of grace, Think that she does not frighten with her face. Now Silence in the country stalk'd the dews, As if she wore a flannel pair of shoes, Lone list'ning, as the poets well remark, To falling mill-streams, and the mastiff's bark; To loves of wide-mouth'd cats, most mournful tales; To hoot of owls amid the dusky vales, To hum of beetles, and the bull-frog's snore, The spectre's shriek, and ocean's drowsy roar.— Lull'd was each street of London to repose, Save where it echo'd to a watchman's nose; Or where a watchman, with ear-piercing rattle, Rous'd his brave brothers from each box to battle; To fall upon the Cynthias of the night, Sweet nymphs! whose sole profession is delight! Thus the gaunt wolves the tender lambs pursue, And hawks, in blood of doves, their beaks imbrue! Thus on the flies of evening rush the bats, And mastiffs sally on the am'rous cats! Still was the palace, save where now and then The tell-tale feet of love-designing men, Night-wand'ring lords, soft patting on the floor, Of maids of honour sought the chamber door; Obliging door! that, op'ning to the tap, Admitted lords to take a social nap, And chase most kindly from each timid maid The ghosts that frightful haunt the midnight shade: For very horrid 'tis, we all must own, For poor defenceless nymphs to lie alone; Since nights are often doleful, dark, and drear, And raise in gentle breasts a world of fear. Nay, were not lords ordain'd for ladies' charms; To guard from perils dire, and dread alarms? Yes! and like lock'd-up gems those charms to keep, Amidst the spectred solitude of sleep. How wicked then to fly in Nature's face, And deal damnation on a kind embrace! Pardon, ye grave divines, this doctrine strange, Who think my morals may have caught the mange. Still was the palace, save where some poor fly, With thirst just ready to drop down and die, Buzz'd faint petitions to his Maker's ear, To show him one small drop of dead small beer; Save where the cat, for mice, so hungry, watching, Swore the lean animals were scarce worth catching; Save where the dog so gaunt, in grumbling tone, By dreams deluded, mouth'd a mutton bone; Save where, with throats to sounds of horror strain'd, Crickets of coughs and rheumatisms complain'd, Lamenting sore, amid a royal hold, ‘How hard that crickets should be kill'd by cold!’ Now Fame to Discord's dreary mansion flew, To tell the beldame more than all she knew, Who, at the Devil's table, for her work, For ever welcome finds a knife and fork: Discord, a sleepless hag, who never dies, With snipe-like nose, and ferret-glowing eyes, Lean, sallow cheeks, long chin, with beard supply'd, Poor crackling joints, and wither'd parchment hide, As if old drums, worn out with martial din, Had clubb'd their yellow heads to form her skin; Discord, who, pleas'd a universe to sway, Is never half so bless'd as in a fray: Discord, to deeds, indeed, most daring giv'n, Who bade vile Satan raise a dust in heav'n; Stirr'd up the sweetest angels to rebel, And sunk the fairest forms to darkest hell; Bade by her din, the humblest spirits rise, Bold to dethrone the Monarch of the Skies; For which they very properly were sent, Unhappy legions! into banishment; Doom'd, for such most abominable sinning, To broil on charcoal, with eternal grinning. Discord, who whisper'd to the jealous Cain, ‘Go crack thy brother's box that holds his brain;’ Which Cain perform'd, in godliness unstable, That foe to piety and brother Abel: Discord, who haunts poor G?'s maudlin dame, And makes her duke of wisdom cry out ‘Shame!’ Who, after dinner, for her honours screams, And grasps a British crown in drunken dreams; Then roars as though (what richly she deserves) The d?ke had clapp'd a broomstick to her nerves: Discord, who also often doth profane The goodly streets and courts of Drury-lane; Where bawd meets bawd, blaspheming, swearing, drunk, Pimp knocks down pimp, and punk abuses punk: Discord, delighting in the wordy war, The pillar of the senate and the bar: Discord, who makes a ?? delight in ode, Slight Square of Hanover Gallini's Rooms are in this square, in which is performed the celebrated professional concert. for Tott'nham Road; Where, with the taste sublime of Goth and Vandal, He orders the worst works of heavy Handel; Encores himself This was a most ludicrous circumstance that happened not long since, when his ????? and the orchestra were left to themselves and God save the king., till all the audience gape, And suffers not a quaver to escape: Discord, all eye, all mouth, all ear, all nose, For ever warring with a world's repose! When Fame arriv'd, the shaving tale to tell, Pleas'd was the red-ey'd fury in her cell, Where scorpions crawl'd, where screech'd that noisy fowl, Known in Great-Britain by the name of owl; Bats shriek'd, and grillatalpas join'd the sound, Cats squall'd, pigs whin'd, and adders hiss'd around. Close to the restless wave her mansion lay, Receding from the beam of cheerful day: Hence on black wing the hag was wont to roam, And join the witches 'mid the stormy gloom; Howl with delight amid the thunder's roar; Hang o'er the wrecks that crowd the billowy shore; See, 'midst each flash, the heads of seamen rise, And drink with greedy ears their drowning cries.— Around her dwelling various portraits hung, Of those whose noisy names in hist'ry rung, Here, with spread arms, whom grace and fury fill, Thund'ring damnation, star'd Stentorian Hill: There, curs'd Sir Joseph Banks, in quest of fame, At finding fleas and lobsters not the same. Here, a prime fav'rite, of a sainted band, Hell in his heart, and torches in his hand; Lord George by mobs huzza'd, and, what is odd, Burning poor Papists for the love of God; Pleas'd as old Nero on each falling dome, Sublimely fiddling to the flames of Rome! There, in respect to kings, not over nice, That revolution-sinner—Doctor Price: Whose labours, in a most uncourtly style. Win not, like gentle Burke's, the royal smile; Gain not from good divines both praise and thanks, Call'd, by the wicked, ‘Gospel mountebanks, Mere quack pretenders, from their lofty station Puffing off idle nostrums of salvation; Who, where the milk and honey flows, resort, Like rooks in corn fields, black'ning all the court.’ Here, leading all her bears so savage forth, Wild rag'd the Amazonian of the north, With ruin leagu'd, t'attack the Turkish hive, And leave not half a Mussulman alive: There storm'd a vixen, far and near renown'd For sweetness, meekness, piety profound; Her sons abusing (in abuses old), With all the fury of a German scold!— These, with some scores, were seen, of equal fame, Thanks to a lonely taper's livid flame! The form of Madam Schwellenberg she took, Her broken English, garb, and sin-like look; Then sought the palace, and the royal ear, And whisper'd thus, ‘Mine God, sir, nebber fear— Oh, please your majesty, you ver ver right: Shave all de rascal, if but out of spite. Lord! Lord! how vill a mighty monarch look, Not able, O mine God! for shave a cook! Dat like a king, I say, what can't do dat? Mine God! pray haf more spirit dan a cat. Ser, in mine court, de prince be great as king— He scorn to ax one word about a ting. Mine God! de cook muss nebber dare make groan, Nor dare to tell a prince der soul der own: 'Tis de dam Englis only, dat can say, “Boh! fig for king! by God I'll haf my way.” ‘I haf see court enough—a prince and dook, But nebber wish on sush as dis to look: I say ver often to myself—Goode God! I nebber vish a crown mine head for load! I do not vish myself more greater efils— A king of Englis be a king of defils: To punishment de lousy rascal bring, And show dem all vat 'tis for be a king. America haf cover us vid shame; Jack Wilkes, too, be a dam, dam uglish name; And sal de paltry cook be conqueror too?— No, God forbid! as dat vill nebber do. De hair muss fall before your royal eye, 'Tis someting, fags! to triumph 'pon poor fly.’— Pleas'd with her voice, the king of nations smil'd, For pow'r with monarchs is a fav'rite child:— ‘What! what! not shave 'em, shave 'em, shave 'em, shave 'em? Not all the world, not all the world shall save 'em. I'll sheer 'em, sheer 'em, as I sheer my sheep.’— Thus spoke the mighty monarch in his sleep: Which proves that kings in sleep a speech may make, Equal to what they utter broad awake. Charm'd with the mischief full on fancy's view, Quick to the major's room the Fury flew; Put off the form of Schwellenberg, and took Of Madam Haggerdorn the milder look: A woman, in whose soul no guile is seen, The mistress of the robes to our good queen; A queen, who really has not got her peer; A queen, to this our kingdom, wondrous dear; Which shows, however folks are apt to sport, That all the virtues may be found at court.— Now, in the major's ear the beldame said, ‘Yan Dixon—Yan, you must not, man, be fraid. I like mush your peteeshon to de king, Though George will swear 'tis dam, dam saucy ting; And swear, dat as his soul is to be save, Dat ebbry von of you sal all be shave: Yan Dixon, rader your dear life lay down, Dan be de laugh (mine Gote) of all de town. De ver, ver littel boy an girl you meet, Vill point and laugh and hoot you trow de street. De same (mine Gote) vill chimney-sweep behave, And cry, “Dere go de blockhead dat vas shave:” “Dere go von poor shave fellow!” cry de trull, “Because he had de louse upon his skull.” I know he say, dat you sal lose your lock, Before to morrow mornin twalfe o'clock. I tink dere may be battle—nebber mind, I hope dat Godamighty will be kind. What, if de king make noise about de house, For noting but his dam confounded louse; He be but von, you know; an den for you, Mine Gote! Yan Dixon, you is fifty-two: Tink, Yan, how George vas frighten by de mob, When Lord George Gordon made dat burnin job. Mine Gote! Yan, mind me, rader lose dy place, Dan suffer such dam nasty dam disgrace. I tell you true, indeed, ver true, dear Yan, His majesty be ver goot sort of man; But ver ver like indeed as oder men, Dat is, a leetel stubborn now an den.— Tink, Yan, of dat ver ugly ting, a wig, For pot-boy and de pot-girl run der rig! Boh! filty ting, enough de deffil for scare; An made perhap of dismal dead man's hair! I sal not wonders if, dy soul for shock, A ghost come seize upon der stolen lock. No, fags! nor vonders if dey come an pull De vig vid mush, mush fury from dy scull. Pon som poor strumpet head perhap dat grow'd, Dat die of dam dissorder, nasty toad!’— Thus saying, lo! the Fury made retreat, And left the lord of saucepans in a sweat. Just like King Richard in his tent, John rear'd, And verily a man of woes appear'd. Now handling his small pig-tail, ‘Now you're here,’ Exclaim'd the Major, ‘but not long, I fear: Perhaps some good may follow this same dream, And resolution mar this shaving scheme. Curs'd be the louse that so much mischief bred, And yields to barbers' boys, the harmless head: Curs'd be the razor-maker, curs'd the prig Who thought upon that greasy thing—a wig. Sure, 'twas some mangy beast, some scabby rogue, Who brought a thing so filthy into vogue! Had Nature meant the scare-crow to be worn, Infants with wigs had certainly been born.— But, lo! with little hair, and that uncurl'd, But not with wigs, they come into the world! What shame, that sheep, that horses, cows, and bulls, Should club their tails, to furnish Christian sculls! But what a sacrilegious shame, the dead Can't keep, poor souls, their locks upon their head! What shame the spectres, in the midnight air, Should wander, screaming for their plunder'd hair! Curs'd be the shaving plan, I say again, Although the bantling of a royal brain!’ Thus curs'd the Major to Night's list'ning ear, Enough to turn a Christian pale to hear! Thus, heedless of hereafter, for a pin Will men and women run their souls in sin! Now paus'd the Major, with a thoughtful air; And now soliloquied with solemn stare:— ‘Drunk with dominion, gorg'd with vicious thoughts, With folly teeming, doz'd by flattery's draughts, Taught to admire their very maudlin dreams, And think their brains' dull mudpools, Wisdom's streams,— Too many a monarch lives; but, lo! not ours! A king, who Wisdom's very self devours; Snaps at arts, sciences, where'er they rise, With all the fire of boys at butterflies.— Such cannot, surely own little heart; Therefore our locks and we may never part.’ Now, from a stool, a tinder-box he took, And fiercely with the stone the steel he struck; And, after many unsuccessful shocks, The sparks inflam'd the tinder in the box; Which, by a match which John did sagely handle, Gave sudden lustre to a farthing candle. Thus, if small things with great we may compare, We see hard pedagogues, with furious air, Strike with the fist, and often with a stick, Light through a scholar's scull, ten inches thick. Now, full illuminated, Dixon stole, Where lay a master-cook within his hole: From whence, to all th' inferior cooks they went, Inclin'd to opposition's big intent; But, not so fierce, alas! for opposition, As in the threat'ning, bullying petition; For men (it is reported) dash and vapour Less on the field of battle, than on paper. Thus, in the hist'ry of each dire campaign, More carnage loads the newspaper than plain. And now the cooks and scullions left each nest; And now, behold, they one and all were drest. Lo! sullen to the kitchen mov'd the throng, Gloom on each eye, and silence on each tongue: How much like crape-clad mourners round a bier! But, ah! impress'd with sorrow more sincere; For oft, at tombs, with joy the bosom burns— There, 'tis the sable back alone that mourns. Now making, with a few dry chips, a fire, They sullen sat, their grief commix'd with ire; Sad ruminating all around the flame, Like Harry and his band, of deathless name, Near Agincourt, expectant of the day Big with the horrors of a bloody fray; A fray that threaten'd his poor little band, To sweep it, just like spiders, to that land Terra incognita yclep'd, which stretches Afar!—of which, imperfect are our sketches; Since all who have survey'd this distant bourn, So welcom'd, were not suffer'd to return.— Thus did the cooks expect the fatal morn, When, sheep-like, ev'ry head was to be shorn. Now to the whit'ning east they cast their sight, And wish'd, but vainly, an eternal night: Not with less pleasure stares upon the day, The wretch condemn'd hard nature's debt to pay; Condemn'd ere noon to act a deed abhorr'd; To stretch, for justice' sake, the fatal cord: Not with less pleasure shrunk (unknown to shame), A meat, drink, snuff, and diamond-loving dame, When told, ‘That if poor Hastings went to pot, Away went pearls, and jewels, and what not, Torn from the stomacher so fine, yet foul, Which Av'rice thirsted for, and Rapine stole:’ Not with less pleasure, in the vale of life, Poor Egl?n?t?n beheld a youthful wife, (Forc'd, on a bed of ice, sweet flow'r, to bloom; Ah! forc'd to shine, a sun-beam, on a tomb) That blooming youthful wife, inclin'd to stray With Ham?lton, all in a billing way; Just like two turtles, or a pair of lambs, Or ewes so playful with the frisky rams: Not with less glee an old and hopeless maid, Surveys the sun ascending from the shade; A sun, that gives a younger sister's charms, So hated, to a bridegroom's happy arms: Not with less joy, that raging chaste old maid Sees the frail fair-ones in the Cyprian trade Escape the whip and gaol, and hemp beside, By means of gentle Mister Justice Hyde. Sweet wrecks of beauty! though, with aspic eye, And glance disdainful, Prudery pass them by, With mincing step, and squinting cautious dread, As though their looks alone contagion shed.— I view each pallid wretch with grief sincere, And call on Pity for her tend'rest tear; See, on their cheeks, the blush of virtue burn; Hear from their souls, the sigh of ruin mourn; View, veil'd in horror's gloom, their swimming eyes, Beaming with hopeless wishes to the skies, Like the pale Moon's dim solitary form, Wrapp'd in the darkness of the midnight storm. Too oft, by Treach'ry's winning smile betray'd, Too fondly trusting, falls the simple maid! Too many a Th?l?e walks the world of woe, To foul of Innocence the sacred snow! To love, yet nurse the thought of villain art, How hard a lesson for the partial heart! Too hard a lesson for the female soul, Where Love no partner owns, and scorns control. Not with less pleasure doth a poet look On cruel criticism, which damns his book, Or recommends it to that peaceful shore Where books and bards are never heard of more, Than look'd each man, with lengthen'd boding beard, On that sad morn, which doom'd them to be shear'd: Not with less pleasure, likewise, let me say, A hungry author sees his dying play; Child of his dotage, who surveys its fall, Just as mankind shall view the tumbling ball; When sun, moon, stars, and all the distant spheres, Burst in one general wreck about their ears. Not with less pleasure did Sir William's This gentleman still retains the place of comptroller of the board of works, to the kingdom's surprise; but demerit in building, as well as in painting, is a sufficient recommendation to a certain species of patrons, particularly if the professors are despised by the people at large. It is the money of this nation, that is sought for, not the merit. The circumstance of being a foreigner too (for this same Sir William Chambers is a Swede), carries with it another strong claim to favouritism! eye See Somerset's bold wing desert its sky; A fall, at which the nation's purse exclaims, That thund'ring crush'd the back of roaring Thames: Not with less pleasure did Sir William's ear, A second crash of this fam'd fabric hear; When poor Sir Joshua, with his painting band, Swore the dread day of judgment just at hand. Not with less glee, tenacious of his dross, Ross The present Bishop of Exeter, who, when his majesty visited that ancient city, lately most handsomely excused himself the honour of entertaining his royal master, by billeting him upon Dean Buller. The following lines, extracted from a manuscript performance of one John Ploughshare, called the Royal Progress, we think, will elucidate this part of our epic, and not be unacceptable to our readers. ‘In comm'd the king at laste to town With doust and zweat az nutmeg brown, The hosses all in smoke; Huzzaing, trumpeting, and ringing, Red colours vleeing, roaring, dringing, Zo mad zeem'd all the voke. Wiping his zweaty jaws and poll, All over douste we spied 'Squire Rolle, Close by the king's coach trattin; Now shoving in the coach his head, Meaning (we thoft) it might be zed, “'Squire Rolle and George be chattin.” Now went the Aldermen and May'r, Zome with cut wigs, and zome with hair, The royal voke to ken; When Measter May'r, upon my word, Pok'd to the king a gert long sword, Which he pok'd back agen. Now thoose that round his worship stood, Declar'd it clumsily was dood; Yet Squirt, the people zay, Brandish'd a gert hoss glyster-pipe, To make un in his lesson ripe, That took up half a day. Now down droo Vore-street did they com, Zum hallowin, and screeching zum: Now trudg'd they to the dean's; Becaze the bishop zent mun word, “A could not meat and drink avord, A had not got the means.” A zed, that, ‘az vor he, poor man, A had not got a pot or pan, Nor spoon, nor knive, nor vork; That he was weak, and ould, and squeal, And zeldom made a hearty meal, And zeldom drade a cork.’ Indeed, a is a moderate man, And zo be all the clargy clan, That with un come to chatter; Who, when they're ax'd to a glass of wine, To one the wother they tip the sign, And beg my lord's fine water. Then az vor rooms—why, there agen ‘A could not lodge a cock, nor hen, They were zo small,’ a zed; And, az vor beds, they wudn't do, In number about one or two, Vor self and Joan the maid. In voolish things, a wudn't be cort, 'Twas stoopid to treat vokes for nort:— No; twazn't heese desire. Prefarment, too, waz to an eend; The king would never more vor'n zend, To lift un one peg higher. And yet vokes zay's a man o'sense, Honest and good—but hoardth his pence; Can't peart with drink nor met. An then why vore? the peepel rail:— To greaze a vat ould pig in the tail— Ould Weymouth o'Long Leat. Well, to the dean's, bounce in they went, And all the day in munchin spent, And guzlin, too, no doubt; And, while the gentry drink'd within, The mob, with brandy, ale, and gin, Got roaring drunk without.’ started—Reader! not the Man of Ross— When majesty, to rest his royal head, Ask'd of the church's mitred son a bed,— Poor man! who proving, like his sovereign, poor, Begg'd him to knock at good Dean Buller's door; Buller, who took his wand'ring master in, And stuff'd with corn and oil his scrip and skin; For which (on gratitude so wont to dote) The monarch gave a tumbler—worth a groat! O glorious act! an act, how seldom seen! O what a day of gladness for the Dean! A gift so rare, so noble, so sublime, Will stupefy the sons of distant time. This, let the Buller family record; This little treasure let the Bullers hoard; Yet show, exulting, upon gala days, To bid some favour'd guest admire and praise. Now did the major hum a tune so sad! Chromatic—in the robes of sorrow clad: But, lo! the ballad could not fear control, Nor exorcise the barbers from his soul: And now his lifted eyes the ceiling sought; And now he whistled—not for want of thought. A mournful air the whistling major chose: Still on his rolling eye the razors rose. From grave to sprightly now he chang'd—a jig— Still o'er his haunted fancy wav'd the wig; Still saw his eye alarm'd, the scratch A small wig, or rather an apology for a wig, so called, and generally worn by our most amiable and august monarch. abhorr'd, Like wild Macbeth's, the visionary sword.— Thus, from what kings, alas! may fancy fun, His loving subjects may be glad to run: Thus, when St. Swithin from his fountain pours; St. Swithin, tutelary saint of show'rs; Beaux skip, belles scamper, fly the cocks and hens, With drooping plumage, to the shelt'ring pens; While, lo! the waddling ducks te deum utter, Flap their glad wings, and gabble through the gutter. Sing, Muse! or, lo! our canto not complete, What air he humm'd, and whistled all so sweet. Homer, of ev'ry thing minutely speaks, From Heaven's ambrosia, to a camp's beef-steaks: Then let us, Muse, adopt a march sublime, And try to rival Homer with our rhime; Who, had a nit, in Juno's tresses bred, Dropp'd on divine Minerva's wiser head; Or Cook-like flea, exploring some new track, Hopp'd from the clouds to Agamemnon's back; The bard had sung the fall in verse divine, And critics heard the sound along the line. Jove call'd his Juno only saucy bitch; The poet thought it would his song enrich: Jove, too, just threaten'd, with some birchen rods, To whip her publicly before the gods; The bard (though but a flogging bout at most) Deem'd it, indeed, too sacred to be lost: Jove call'd his daughter only bitch and fool (Poor Pallas, treated like a girl at school), Threaten'd to ham-string her six fav'rite nags, And tear her bran new phaëton to rags; The bard, who never wrote an idle word, Bade his bold verse, the god's bold speech record: And had the Thund'rer but broke wind, the song Had, imitative, borne the blast along.— Then be it known to all the world around, To folks above, and people underground, To fish and fowl, and every creeping thing— Lillibullero, and God save the king, Were actually the very airs he chose! But wherefore—God Almighty only knows! CANTO IV. THE ARGUMENT. Morning and Majesty get out of Bed together—A most solemn and pathetic Address to the Muse, with Respect to Omens—A serious Complaint against the Omens for their Non-appearance on so important an Occasion—The Wives and Daughters of the Cooks seek the Palace, to encourage their Husbands—A beautiful Comparison of Cocks and Hens—The Dismay of the Cooks—The natural History of Eyes—Mister Ramus enters the Kitchen—Mister Ramus is praised for Dexterity in shaving Majesty—Mister Ramus's Consequence with Majesty superior to that of great Ministers—Mister Ramus's namby-pamby name Billy, given by Majesty—The Dread occasioned by Mister Ramus's Appearance amongst the Cooks—Mister Secker, Clerk of the Kitchen, enters in a Passion—Mister Secker threatens tremendously—A Wife of one of the Cooks nobly answers Mister Secker, and vows Opposition—Mister Secker replies with Astonishment, Vociferation, and Threat—The Heroine's Rejoinder to Mister Secker, with much Sarcasm—Mister Secker groweth very wroth—studieth Revenge—Prudence appeareth to him, and administereth great and wholesome Advice—Prudence becalmeth the Clerk of the Kitchen—A second Heroine appeareth, speechifieth, and threateneth—slily alludeth to the immense Wealth of male Majesty, and the Heaps of Diamonds belonging to female Majesty—praiseth her Husband's Cleanliness, and denieth a Louse-Existence in his Head, and squinteth at Mister Secker as the probable Owner of the Animal—Mister Secker rageth a second Time—One of the finest Comparisons in the World, between Mister Secker in a Passion, and a Leg of Mutton and Turnips in the Pot—The Poet pauseth, moralizeth, and trembleth at that Devil, lately introduced to the World, called Equality, the Enemy of Majesty—Some of the sweetest Lines in the World on the Occasion—Prudence re-entereth to becalm Mister Secker, by clapping her Hand on his Mouth—An inexpressibly apt Bottle-of-small-beer Comparison—The Cook-major riseth in Wrath, and is very satirical on Mister Secker—The Clerk of the Kitchen replies with Intrepidity—A great deal of good company rushes into the Kitchen—Mister Secker commands Silence, and announces the Will of his Sovereign—the Sovereign eloquently announceth also his own will—A sweet and sublime Comparison, equal to any thing in Homer. With beauteous Lambert's blush, and Russel's smiles, Aurora peep'd upon the first of Isles; And, lo! to bleating flock, and whistling bird, Uprose the sun, and uprose G. the Third, Who left his queen so charming, and her room, To talk of hounds and horses with the groom. Say, Muse, what! not one cloud with low'ring looks, To gloom compassion on the heads of cooks? What! not one solitary omen sent; Not one small sign, to tell the great event? On Cato's danger, clouds of ev'ry shape Hung on the firmament their dismal crape; Aurora wept, poor girl, with sorrow big; And Phœbus rose without his golden wig! But now the skies their usual manners lost, The sun and moon, and all the starry host! No raven at the window flapp'd his wings, And croak'd portentous to the cooks of kings; No horses neigh'd, no bullocks roar'd so stout; No sheep, like sheep be-devil'd, ran about; No lightnings flash'd, no thunder deign'd to growl; No walls re-echo'd to the mournful owl; No jackass bray'd affright; no ghost 'gan wall; No comet threaten'd empires with his tail; No witches, wildly screaming, rode the broom; No pewter platters danc'd about the room. Thus unregarded droop'd each menac'd head, As though the omens all were really dead; As unregarded (what a horrid slur!) As though the monarch meant to shave a cur! Now to the kitchen of the palace came Full many a damsel sweet, and daring dame, The wives and daughters of those cooks forlorn Whose luckless heads were threaten'd to be shorn: Ire in each eye, and vengeance in each hand, To cheer their husbands, pour'd the boastful band! Thus, when the ancient Britons rush'd to battle, Their wives intrepid join'd the general rattle; Encouraging their husbands in the fray, For fear some pale-nos'd rogues might run away: O glorious act!—repelling coward fear.— Thus cocks fight bravest when the hens are near. Now on the band of ladies star'd the cooks, And seem'd to show hair-ruin in their looks. Great is the eloquence of eyes indeed— Much hist'ry in those tell-tale orbs we read! What though no bigger than a button hole, Yet what a wondrous window to the soul! The bosom's joy, and grief, and hope, and fear, In lively colours are depicted here! Now to the crowded kitchen Ramus springs, Ramus, call'd Billy by the best of kings; Who much of razors and of soapsuds knows, Well skill'd to take great Cæsar by the nose: Much by his sovereign lov'd, a trusty page, Who often puts great statesmen in a rage; Poor lords! compell'd against their will to wait, Though ass-like laden with affairs of state, Till page and monarch finish deep disputes On buckskin breeches, or a pair of boots! Billy, a pretty name of love so sweet, Familiar, easy, for affection meet! Thus formal Patrick is transform'd to paddy; And father, by the children christen'd daddy: And Oliver, who could e'en kings control, By many a thousand is baptiz'd Old Noll. Speak, reader, didst thou ever see a ghost? If so—thou stoodest, staring like a post: Thus did the cooks on Billy Ramus stare, Whose frightful presence porcupin'd each hair. Now enter'd Secker Late clerk of the kitchen.—and now thus he spoke:— ‘This Louse affair's a very pretty joke! Arn't you asham'd of it, you dirty dogs?— Zounds! have you all been sleeping with the hogs? But mind—you'll be, to all your great delight, Bald as so many coots before 'tis night. No murmurs, gentlemen—'tis all in vain: When monarchs order, who shall dare complain? Now from the female band, a heroine rav'd, ‘G?d curse me, if my husband shall be shav'd! You shan't, you shan't the fellow's head disgrace— I say, the man shall sooner lose his place. Wigs, like the very devil, I loath, I hate— And curse me, if a nightcap hugs his pate.’— ‘How, impudence!’ the wrathful Secker cry'd, With horror staring, and a mouth yard wide— ‘Where, where's my stick, my cane, my whip, my switch?’ ‘Who taught rebellion t'ye, you saucy b?? ‘Myself,’ with hands akembow cry'd the dame— ‘I tell ye, Mister Secker, 'tis a shame— I tell ye that the cooks will all be fools, To suffer razors to come near their skulls. Bitch too, forsooth the language of a hog! If I'm a bitch, then somebody's a dog.’ Now all th' internal man of Secker boil'd— From thought to thought of turbulence he toil'd: Now, resolution-fraught, he wish'd to stick her. Now in her face to spit, and now to kick her. But Prudence in that very moment came, And sweetly whisper'd to the man of flame— ‘Fie, Secker! kick a woman! Secker, fie! On matter more sublime, thy prowess try— No glory springs from kicking wives of cooks. Strive to surpass great kings in binding books; Transcend great kings in forcing stubborn kine To breakfast on horse chesnuts, sup, and dine; In educating pigs, be thou as deep! And learn, like kings, to feel the rumps of sheep. Go, triumph at the market towns with wool: Go, breed for lady-cows the bravest bull; Tow'r o'er the scepter'd great in fat of lambs, And rise a rival in the breed of rams.— These be thine acts—from hence fair glory flows, Whose beam, a bonfire round a monarch glows, Surpass in charity towards the poor; Nor bully starving merit from the door. Behold, for patronage lean genius pant: What though the wealthy great a taste may want, Yet, would they cast their eyes on pining merit, Those eyes would quickly warm her frozen spirit. The fool may lift the mourner from the tomb, And bid the buried seeds of genius bloom. Yes, fools of Fortune, did those fools incline To look on humble worth, might bid her shine: Thus tallow candles in a chandelier, Make the keen beauties of the glass appear, Call into note a thousand trembling rays, And share the merit of the mingled blaze. The great should sun-like bid their treasures flow, Whose beams wide-spreading no distinction know; But equal bid the crab and pine be ripe; And light at once a system and a pipe.’ Thus Prudence spoke, when Secker to the dame Confess'd his fault, and stopp'd the bursting flame. Now storm'd a second heroine from the band, Call'd Joan, and full at Secker made a stand— ‘I say, Tom shan't be shav'd—he shan't—he shan't, Leek porridge, stir-about, we'll sooner want; We'll rather hunt the gutters for our meat! Cry mackrel, or sing ballads through the street; Foot stockings, mend old china, or black shoes, Sooner than Tom, poor soul, his locks shall lose. Humph! what a pretty hoity toity's here? Thomas, I say, shan't lose his locks, poor dear! Shav'd too! 'cause people happen to be poor— I never heard of such a trick before. Folks, think they may take freedoms with a cook— Go, ask your master if he'd shave a duke. No—if he dar'd to do it, I'll be curst: No Secker, he would eat the razor first. Good lord! to think poor people's heads to plunder. Why, lord! are people drunk, or mad, I wonder? What! shall my poor dear husband lose his locks Because a han't ten millions in the stocks? Because on me, forsooth, a can't bestow A di'mond petticoat, to make a show? Marry come up, indeed—a pretty joke— Any thing's good enough for humble folk: Shov'd here and there, forsooth; call'd dog and b?, God bless us well, because we are not rich. People will soon be beat about with sticks, Forsooth, because they han't a coach and six. A shan't be shav'd, and I'am his lawful wife: The man was never lousy in his life. Ax what his mother says—his nearest kin— “Tom never had a blotch upon his skin, But when a had the measles and small pox.” What for, then, shall the fellow lose his locks? “She never in her life-time saw (she says) A tidier, cleanlier lad, in all her days— And all her neighbours said with huge surprise, A finer boy was never seen with eyes!” So, Mister Secker, let's have no more touse— Hunt further for the owner of the Louse. Sir, 'tis a burning shame, I'm bold to say, To take poor people's character away. Who knows the varmine isn't your own, odsfish! You're fond of peeping into ev'ry dish.’ Again of Secker boil'd th' internal man; Thought urging thought, again to rage began: Huge thoughts of diff'rent sizes swell'd his soul; Now mounting high, now sinking low, they roll; Bustling here, there, up, down, and round about; So wild the mob, so terrible the rout! How like a leg of mutton in the pot, With turnips thick surrounded all so hot! Amid the gulph of broth, sublime, profound, Tumultuous, jostling, how they rush around! Now up the turnips mount with skins of snow, While restless, lab'ring mutton dives below— Now lofty soaring, climbs the leg of sheep, While turnips downwards plunges 'mid the deep! Strange such resemblances in things shoul lie! But what escapes the poet's piercing eye? Just like the sun—for what escapes his ray, Who darts on deepest shade the golden day! Muse, let us pause a moment—here we see A woman, certainly of low degree, Reviling folk of elevated station; Thus waging war with mild subordination. Should sweet subordination chance to die, Adieu to kings and courtier-men so high; Then will that imp equality prevail, Who knows no diff'rence between head and tail; Then majesty, the lofty nose who lifts, With tears shall wash and iron her own shifts; To darn her stockings, from her height descend; Which now are giv'n to Mackenthun A lady, attendant on the princesses, to mend— Turn her fair fingers into vulgar paws, And wash her dirty laces and her gauze. Then dimn'd are coronets that awe inspire, And sceptres stuff'd, like faggots in the fire. Ne'er let me view the hour, my soul that shocks, When female majesty shall wash her smocks: Such humbled grandeur let me never see: Soapsuds and sovereignty but ill agree: Malkin and majesty but ill accord: Rubbers and royalty are kin abhorr'd! Strange union! 'tis the vulture and the bat; A gulf and mudpool—elephant and rat; A great archbishop, and an undertaker; The muse of epic, and a riddle-maker; A roaring king in tragedy sublime, And he who plays poor pug in pantomime; The lord who in the senate wonder draws, Firm in the fair support of freedom's cause; And that same Lord, behind the scenes, a snail, Who, crawling, of an actress holds the tail; Marchesi on the stage with steel and plume, And that Marchesi in a lady's room; Sir Joseph Sir Joseph Banks. A part of his royal insignia is a hammer to knock down a dispute, and keep the Royal Society awake., Jove-like, with his hammer'd arm, Who thund'ring breaks of sleep the opiate charm; And that Sir Joseph, with a simple look, Collecting simples near the simple brook. Again came Prudence, quaker-looking form, Sweet-humour'd goddess, to suppress the storm, Who clapp'd her hands (indeed an act uncouth) Full on the gaping hole of Secker's mouth; Compressing thus a thousand iron words, Sharp ev'ry soul of them as points of swords: But soon her hand forsook his lips and chin, Who own'd the goddess, and but gave a grin. Thus from a fretful bottle of small beer, If, mad, the cork should leap with wild career; Lo, to the bottle's mouth the butler flies, And with dexterity his hand applies! In vain the liquor bustles 'mid the dome; John quells all fury, and subdues the foam! Now rose the major—‘Mister Secker—sir, You make in this affair a pretty stir! 'Twere doubtless a fine present in a box, To offer to our sovereign lord, the locks: Some vast reward would follow to be sure; A pretty little, sweet snug sinecure. Yes—Master Secker well can play his cards: Sublime achievements claim sublime rewards. I humbly do presume, sir, that his grace Has promis'd ye a warm exciseman's place:— Some folks are jacks-in-office, fond of power!’ Thus spoke the cook, like vinegar so sour. ‘No matter, Master Major, what I get; All that I know, is this, your heads shall sweat: I'll see the business done, depend upon't— I'll order matters, d?n me, if I don't: Yes, Master Dixon, you shall know who's who— Which is the better gemman, I or you.’ Thus answers Secker to the man of woes, And points his satire with a cock'd-up nose. Scarce had he utter'd, when a noise was heard; And now behold a motley band appear'd! With Babel sounds at once the kitchen rings, Of groom, page, barber, and the best of kings! And lo, the best of queens must see the fun; And lo, the princesses so beauteous run; And Madam Schwellenberg came hobbling too; Poor lady, losing in the race a shoe! But in revenge-pursuit, the loss how slight! The world would lose a leg, to please a spite. And now for peace did Secker bawl aloud; And lo, peace came at once among the crowd. In courts of justice thus, to hush the hum, ‘Silence,’ the crier calls, and all his mum— ‘Cooks, scullions, all, of high and low degree, Attend, and learn our monarch's will from me. Our sovereign lord the king, whose word is fate, Wills in his wisdom to see shav'd each pate: Then, gentlemen, pray take your chairs at once; And let each barber fall upon his sconce.’— Thus thunder'd Secker with a Mars-like face, And struck dire terror through the roasting race. Thus roar'd Achilles 'mid the martial fray, When ev'ry frighted Trojan ran away. Calm was the crowd, when thus the king of isles, Firm for the shave, but yet with kingly smiles— ‘You must be shav'd—you shall, you must indeed: No, no, I shan't let slip a single head— A very filthy, nasty, dirty trick— The thought on't turns my stomach—makes me sick, Louse—louse—a nasty thing, a louse I hate:— No, no, I'll have no more upon my plate. One is sufficient—yes, yes—quite a store— I'll have no more—no more, I'll have no more.’ Thus spoke the king, like ev'ry king who gives To triftes, lustre that for ever lives. Thus stinking vapours from the oozy pool, Of cats and kittens, dogs and puppies full, Bright sol sublimes, and gives them golden wings, The cloud on which some say, the cherub sings. CANTO V. Finis coronat opus. THE ARGUMENT.

Now, with the sweetest lips that love inspire, The Princess Royal thus address'd her—: ‘O sir, for once attend a daughter's pray'r— Restrain your fury from your people's hair: A thousand blessings will their mouths bestow, And ev'ry heart with gratitude o'erflow: For such a vict'ry, who would give a fig? Pray, sir, don't make them wear a nasty wig.’ Such sounds, so sweet, nay so divinely broke, As might have mollified the sturdy oak, Were doom'd, in vain, on royal ears to fall! Yet music drove the devil out of Saul! To her the—, with most astonish'd eyes, And surly wrinkled brows so stern, replies; ‘What, what? not shave 'em, shave 'em, now they're caught? What! have this pretty hubbub all for nought? No, no, girl; no, girl; no, girl; no, girl—no— Beg on till doomsday, girl—it shan't be so. How, how, pray, would it look, how, how, pray, look? People would swear I could not shave a cook. You call wigs nasty, miss? Fine speech, indeed! Don't, don't you see I've one upon my head? Go back, go back, Miss Pert,’ he bluntly cry'd; Then with his elbow push'd the nymph aside: Although he did not box her lovely ears, He drown'd the radiance of her eye with tears. Far from the wrathful—the maid withdrew, And veil'd her modest beauties from his view. Thus when the virgin morn her blushes spreads, And paints with purest ray the mountain heads; Behold, those blushes so divine to shroud, The surly Boreas gathers ev'ry cloud; Bids the huge phalanx seek the smiling east, And blot the lustre of her crimson vest: From pole to pole extends the black'ning band; Cloud pressing cloud, obeys his rude command: In tears she moves away, the heav'nly maid, And leaves him monarch of the mighty shade. Now o'er his lofty shoulder, with a sigh, The fair Augusta cast a pitying eye; And whisper'd, ah! so soft, so sweet a prayer, To save from razor-rage the heads of hair! When lo, the ?! ‘What, you too, miss, petition for a knave? You, you, too, miss, an enemy to shave?’ Mute was the maid; when lo, with modest looks, Distress'd, she shrunk away from ? and cooks: Thus, o'er a should'ring cloud the moon so bright Oft gives a peep of momentary light; Much as to say, ‘I wish my smiles to grant, To cheer you darkling mortals, but I can't.’ Sing, heav'nly goddess, how the cooks behav'd, Who swore they'd all be d??n'd ere they'd be shav'd; Who penn'd to majesty the bold petition, And daring fum'd with rebel opposition! Cow'd, cow'd, alas! the lords of saucepans feel— Each heart so val'rous sunk into the heel: And then, each threat'ning Amazonian dame— Her spirit drooping, and extinct her flame— For lo, of ? the pow'rful blaze, His coat's bright gold, and eyeball's rolling gaze, Just like the light that cover'd sad Saint Paul, Flash'd on their visages, and smote them all! Who could have thought that things would thus have ended? Fate seemingly a dreadful crash intended! Such stately resolution in the cooks, Such fierce demeanour in their spouses' looks! But thus in Western India Jove ordains At times an aspect wild of hurricanes: Dark grows the sky, with gleams of threat'ning red: All nature dumb, the smallest zephyr dead— Bird, beast, and mortal, trembling, pausing, still, Expectant of the tempest's mighty will: Tremendous pause! when lo, by small degrees, Light melts the mass; with life returns the breeze; And Danger, on his cloud, who scowl'd dismay, Moves sullen with his threat'ning glooms away. There royalty succeeded; but, alas! In foreign climes this gold will scarcely pass. Sorry am I indeed, and griev'd to hear, That royalty is falling from its sphere; War's mighty first-rate dwindling to a skiff; The knees of Adoration waxing stiff, That bent so pliantly to folk of state— Cock-turkey Grandeur verging to his fate. But thus exclaims the mob:—‘In folly far, Folk deem'd a beam from bogs a falling star, And fancied thunder, all so dread, ador'd, The voice tremendous of an anger'd Lord; The lightning his swift vengeance—never dreaming That mortals, ever poring, ever scheming, Should find that in a phial they should lock it, And bear Heav'n's vengeance in their breeches pocket. See France! lo, Homage much has lost her awe, And blushes now to kiss the lion's paw: Nay, dares to fancy (an old rebel jade) Emp'rors and thrones of like materials made; Nay, fancy too (on bold rebellion's brink) That subjects have a right to speak and think; Revileth ?, for praise and wonder born; Calleth crowns fool caps, that their heads adorn; And sacred sceptres, which we here adore, Mean picklocks for the houses of the poor.— Thus Curiosity no longer springs, And wide-mouth'd Wonder gapes no more at kings. Heavens! if Equality all ranks confounds, No more shall we be whistled to like hounds; Freedom will talk to kings in dauntless tone, And female majesty be just plain Joan! Now taking courage, to his honest breast His hand the major energetic press'd; Cloth'd with humility's mild beam his eye, He thus address'd the ? with a sigh:— ‘O ?! you've call'd me an old fool, to whine: But I'm not old—still many a year is mine; So white, as though from Time, my temples grow, Ingratitude's cold hand hath form'd their snow— Grief dims these eyes, and whitens ev'ry hair; And, lo, my wrinkles are the tracks of care! To tread Life's wild, unwounded by a thorn, Was ne'er the lucky lot of woman-born. Man should be kind to man, O best of ?, And try to blunt the ills that Nature brings; Not bid the cup of bitterness o'erflow, And to her thousands add another woe. Ah! if a trifle can a smile employ, How cruel, sir, to kill the infant joy! How faint of happiness the scatter'd ray, That cheers of life, alas! the little day; While Care and Sorrow's imp-like host invade, And fill a sighing universe with shade! Then bid your noble indignation cease, And suffer our poor locks to rest in peace.’ He ended—Now, with scorn so keen inspir'd, And anger, uninvited, undesir'd, Did Madam Schwellenberg, devoid of grace, O'er the ?'s shoulder poke her cat-like face; And thus: ‘Mine Got den ? vat a saucy vretch! How cleberly dis poor old fella preach! Bring him de polepit—dat he shall be pote in— Jan beat de Mettodisses all as notin.’ Now spoke the spouse of our most glorious ?, Who deem'd a louse a very nasty thing; For folk of Strelitz are so neat and clean, They think on vermin with abhorrent mien! For cleanliness so much in Strelitz thrives, Folks never saw a louse in all their lives; ‘Mine Gote! 'mong men an women, an de boys, Dis shave indeed make very pretty noise! Goote Gote! make rout about a leetel hair! Wig be de fashion—Dixon, take de shair— Sheet down, and don't make hubbub shust like pig: Dere's notin terrible about a wig. Mine Gote! de tremblin fellow seem afred, As if we put a tiger 'pon his head— De ladies now wear wig upon der crown; So sheet you down, Jan Dixon, sheet you down. Cook tell his king and queen he von't be shave! Egote! de Englis don't know how behave! Let cook say so in Strelitz, ah! mine Gote! Dere would be soldiers dat would cut der troat, Yon know dat king an queen, you rebel, Jan, Can cut your head off in a moment, man— Lord! den, you may be tankfull dat we spare, An only cut off goote-for-notin hair. You know dat in our history you read, How king of Englond cut off subjects head!’— Now silence broke the ?: ‘Sit down, sit down! Come, come, let ev'ry barber take his crown; I'll show some mercy, t'ye, ye nasty pigs; For mind, mind, mind, I'll pay for all the wigs!’ At these last words, forth crawl'd an ancient dame, Sharp-nos'd, half-starv'd, and Avarice her name; With wrinkled neck, and parchment-like to view, That e'en the coarsest kerchief seldom knew; With hawk-like eyes that glisten'd o'er her gold, And, raptur'd, ev'ry hour her treasure told; Who of her fingers form'd a comb so fair, And with a garter filleted her hair; Who fiercely snatch'd, with wild devouring eyes, An atom of brown sugar from the flies; Made a sad candle from a dab of fat, And stole a stinking fish head from a cat; Saves of the mustiest bread the crumbs, and sees A dinner in the scrapings of a cheese: Whiffling a stump of pipe, a frequent treat, That gives the stomach smoke, poor thing for meat: Forth hobbled this old dame, with shaking head, Like, in her crooked form, the letter zed— The Palace-watch, and guardian most severe Of drops of dying and of dead small-beer: A dame who hated idle dogs and cats, And trembled at a rompus of the rats; Nay, listen'd, jealous of a scratching mouse, Afraid the imp might swallow the whole house; The province her's, to sell old palace shoes, Old hats, old coats, and breeches to the Jews; And drive, with dog-like fury, from the door, The plaintive murmurs of the famish'd poor: The dame who bade the great Sir Francis sell The sacred pulpit, and the good old bell Sir Francis Drake. Verily this is a fact. The baronet lately disposed of the pulpit and bell of the old chapel at Nutwell, in Devonshire, built by his immortal ancestor. The annual interest of four shillings was too fascinating to be withstood!! Forth hobbled she, and in a quick shrill tone, Thus to the king of nations spoke the crone:— ‘God bless us, sir, why give me leave to say, Your ? is throwing things away! What! give the fellows wigs for every head! A piece of rare extravagance indeed! Let them buy wigs themselves, a dirty crew! An't please your ?, what's that to you? You buy the rascals wigs, indeed, so nice! It only gives encouragement to lice. Marry come up, indeed, I say—new wigs! No—let them suffer for't, the nasty pigs! Lord! they can well afford it—sir, their hair Costs (Heav'n protect us!) what would make you stare. Hours in the barber's hands, forsooth, they sit Reading the newspapers, and books of wit! Just like our men of quality, forsooth, Each full-ag'd gentleman, and dapper youth! Newmarket now, and now the nation studying, In clouds of flour sufficient for a pudding. Lord! what extravagance I see and hear! Unlike your majesty, and madam there, Our great consume and squander, fling away— 'Tis rout and hubbub—spend, spend, night and day Such racketting, that people's peace destroys, As if the world was only made for noise. Would ev'ry duchess copy our good queen, More money in their purses would be seen; Her ? to things can condescend, Which our fine quality, with nose an end, Behold with such contempt, and such a grin, As though a little saving was a sin! Her ?, God bless her! does not scorn To see a stocking and a shoe well worn; To mend, or darn, or clean a lutestring gown, So mock'd, indeed, by all the great in town, Her ? at Frogmore A farm near Windsor, where a parcel of young women, the protégées of majesty, are constantly employed in working beds, and very well know the meaning of the phrase—‘Working one's fingers to the stumps.’, day and night, Can to their labour keep her pupils tight; See that to milliners no trifle goes, That may be done beneath her own great nose. Her ? can buy a hat, or cloak, In shops, indeed, as cheap as common folk: She will not be impos'd upon, she says— O what a good example for our days! When Prudence dictates, lo, no pride she feels: Could order shoes to come with copper heels. Yes, ? could nobly pride renounce, And make a handsome jacket of a flounce; 'Stead of lawn gauze, descend to humble crape, And, 'stead of ribbon, draw a gown with tape; Turn hats to bonnets, by her prudence led, And clean a tarnish'd spangled shoe with bread: A gown's worn sleeve from long to short devote, And into pockets cut an upper coat; Cut shifts to night-caps, satin cloaks to muffs, And calmly frill groat ribbons into ruffs: Blest with the rarest economic wits, Transform an old silk stocking into mits; Transform too (so convertible are things!) E'en flannel petticoats to caps for ?. And then your ?, whom God long keep; How fond, indeed, of every thing that's cheap! “Best is best cheap”—you very wisely cry; And so, an't please your majesty, say I. Lord bless us! why should people spend and riot, When people can so save by living quiet? Give to the poor, forsooth! a rare exploit! Catch what you can, and never give a doit, To Saving, every one should go to school— To my mind, Generosity's a fool. Give, sir, no wigs to cooks; for, as I say, 'Tis kindness and good money flung away.’ Thus ended Avarice, at last, her speech, With praise of ? and ?, and saving, rich. Such words deliver'd with a solemn air, Gave to the ? of men's great eye a stare. ‘Right, right, 'tis very right,’ the ? cries, And on his millions rolls his mental eyes— ‘Right, Mistress Avarice, right, right, indeed I won't buy wigs for every nasty head, No, no, they'll save it, save it as you say— I won't, I won't, I won't fling pence away!’ Here let us pause again, and think how hard That good intentions should be quickly marr'd! Ah? Generosity's a tender plant, It's root so weakly, and its bearings scant! Self-love, too near it, robs it of each ray, And thirsty sucks the rills of life away. Vile weed! (like docks, in coarsest soil which start) That thriveth in the cold and flinty heart.— ‘Come, come, sit down,’ the ? deign'd to rave; ‘Cooks, cooks, sit down—Come, barbers, shave, shave, shave. Yes, yes, I think 'tis right, 'tis right and just— Indeed you must be shav'd—you must, you must: Cooks must not over their superiors tow'r— We must, must show the world that we have pow'r.’ Thus, by ambition fir'd, the ? ended A speech to be transcended, but not mended. What diff'rent roads to Fame, Ambition takes! What hubbub in this under world she makes! Ambition, the queen-passion of the soul! Ev'n Love, sweet Love, indeed, has less control. Ambition makes the wise a fool at court; Ambition drowns an alderman in port; Ambition spurs our great in plays to spout— Spurr'd Sir John Dick to gain a star by Croute; Bade Lady Mary for a eunuch sigh, And Richmond unto battles turn his eye, To beam the cynosure of Bagshot wars, And give Posterity a British Mars. Ambition bade sour Johnson lick the throne, And blink at ev'ry merit but his own; Boswell with praise a Hottentot besmear, And give his country up to lead a bear. Ambition bade Sir Will make new, old jugs, And bake an immortality in mugs: Bade round the world the fam'd Sir Joseph float, To kiss Queen Oberea in the boat; And spurs him now his blood's last drop to shed, In quest of butterflies without a head. Ambition nobly spurr'd the ? of men To walk through Herschell's tube, and back agen; A deed whose lustre Envy must allow, Deep plann'd at Windsor, and perform'd at Slough A village near Windsor, the residence of Dr. Herschell.! Ambition spurr'd a man of royal birth, To humble Madam Schwellenberg to earth. Thus, to the gardens of imperial Kew, When Madam Schwellenberg, for health, withdrew, And round the alleys of that fam'd abode, Sweet ambling, jigging, on a jackass rode; Lo, ? so sly, with stick and pin, Drove the sharp mischief through Jack's frighten'd skin! At once the beast, with sudden start and bound, Wild plunging, hurl'd the lady to the ground; Where, lo, such things appear'd (her legs I mean) As never ought by mortals to be seen; Legs that ne'er saw, ye gods! the sun before! Such legs! as set great Cæsar in a roar. Ambition bids the man of ropes, or figs, Or fish, or brass, or foolscap, peas, or pigs, Sigh for the golden chain, and coach so fair; In short, to shine the city's sun—lord may'r! Blest man! in pomp to visit at St. James, And pour his gilded barges on the Thames; Devour with nobles in th' Egyptian hall, And trip it with a duchess at the ball! Rich honours! but what pity my lord may'r! Should lose at length his chain and coach so fair, And gorgeous gown, and wig, and bright attire, And converse sweet of lord, and knight, and 'squire, Sheriffs and councilmen, and common hunt; To sweat with candles, or with hogs to grunt; Bid waoo, for greasy mutton-lights, adieu; Drop wigs for nightcaps, robes for apron blue: And quit of Justice the celestial scales, To weigh cheese, sugar, tallow, or hobnails! Instead of questions from the best of kings, On solid matters, consequential things, To hear a raggamuffin in his shop— ‘Soap, Master Guttle, quick, a pound of soap!’ With such a careless, broad, irrev'rent stare, As though the chandler ne'er had been lord may'r But so it is—poor Merit oft complains! Blest is the mortal born with goose's brains! What signifies the wisdom of the schools, If Fortune only will make love to fools? Now to the cooks, O wandering Muse, return, For, lo, our readers with impatience burn! Aw'd by the voice of ?, and ?, and page, And Madam Schwellenberg's relentless rage, Down sat the cooks, amid a wond'ring host; The barbers labour'd, and the locks were lost! Thus when Burgoyne, opposing all the fates, Defied, at Saratoga, General Gates; Sudden the hero dropp'd his threat'ning fist. And wisely deem'd it folly to resist; Dropp'd in the victor's arms, (unlucky lot!) And saw his legions sink without a shot!— Speak, heav'nly goddess! was there then no fray, No drops of blood effus'd to mark the day? No fisty-cuffs, no eyes as black as night, No cat-like scratches, no revengeful bite?— Nor fisty-cuffs, nor eyes as black as night, Nor cat-like scratches, nor revengeful bite, The Palace witness'd.—Thus the Muse divine Must close, without one drop of blood, the line; And readers, baulk'd of deeds of high renown, Perhaps shall, grumbling for their money, frown. What can we do, if Fate produc'd no fray? The poet dares not make a murd'rous day— Should Falsehood's tale my sacred song defile, Which damneth half th' historians of our isle; How could I hold aloft my tuneful head, Or proudly hope at doomsday to be read; The glowing wish of ev'ry son of rhime, To live a fav'rite to the end of time! Yet nought were easier than to form a fray, And bring a dozen Gods to aid the day— Yet nought were easier than to raise a battle— Make iron head-piece against head-piece rattle; Nails, nails oppose, and grinders, grinders greet, Nose poke at nose, and stomachs stomachs meet; Wild-rolling eye-balls against eye-balls glare; The dusty floor be strew'd with teeth and hair; Caps, petticoats, and kerchiefs, load the ground; The trembling roofs with mingled cries resound; Legs of joint-stools, and chairs, their vengeance pour; And blocks and mopsticks fly, a wooden show'r; Raise clamours equal to an Indian yell, Transcended only by the cries of hell; And bid old Erebus, in sulphur strong, Display his flaming cauldron in our song. Proud of the shave, the ? of nations smil'd; Nay, laugh'd triumphant, with his glory wild: But still to show his justice, thus he said— ‘Mind, mind me, gentry with the shaven head: Know, know the Louse belongs to some of you— It is a louse—it is—'tis very true: Yes, yes, belongs to some one of the house— I've read Buffon—yes, yes, I know a louse.’ A pill-box then he op'd, with eager look, And show'd the crawler, to convince each cook. The long-ear'd beast of Balaam, lo, we find, Sharp to the beast that rode him spoke his mind; The mournful Xanthus The horse of Achilles. (says the bard of old), Of Peleus' warlike son the fortune told: Thus to the captive Louse was language giv'n, Which proves what int'rest Justice holds in Heav'n. The vermin, rising on his little rump, Like ladies' lag-dogs, that for muffin mump, Thus, solemn as our bishops, when they preach, Made, to the best of ?, his maiden speech: ‘Know, mighty ?, I was born and bred Deep in the burrows of a page's head; There took I sweet Lousilla unto wife, My soul's delight—the comfort of my life; But on a day, your page, sir, dar'd invade Cowslip's sweet lips, your faithful dairy-maid; Great was the struggle for the short-liv'd bliss; At length he won the long-contested kiss!— When, 'mid the struggle, thus it came to pass; Down dropp'd my wife and I upon the lass; From whence we crawl'd (and who's without ambition? Who does not wish to better his condition?) To you, dread sir, where, lo, we lov'd and fed, Charm'd with the fortune of a greater head; Where, safe from nail and comb, and blust'ring wind, We nestled in your little lock behind; Where many a beauteous baby plainly proves, Heav'n, like a ?'s, can bless a louse's loves; Where, many a time, at court, I've join'd your grace, And with you gallop'd in the glorious chase; Lousilla, too, my children, and my nits, Just frighten'd sometimes out of all their wits, It happen'd, sir, ah! luckless, luckless day! I foolish took it in my head to stray— How many a father, mother, daughter, son, Are oft by curiosity undone! Dire wish! for, 'midst my travels, urg'd by Fate, From you, O ?, I fell upon your plate! Sad was the precipice!—and now I'm here, Far from Lousilla and my children dear! Who now, poor souls! in deepest mourning all, Groan for my presence, and lament my fall. Nitilla now, my eldest girl, with sighs Bewails her father lost, with streaming eyes; And Grubbinetta, with the loveliest mien, In state, in temper, and in form a queen; And sturdy Snap, my son, a child of grace, His father's image both in form and face; And Diggory, poor lad, and hopeful Scratch, Boys that Lousilla's soul was proud to hatch; And little Nibble, too, my youngest son, Will ask his mother where his father's gone; Who (poor Lousilla!) only will reply With turtle moan, and tears in either eye. Thus, sir, are you mistaken all this while, And ? and pages, that our race revile, As though our species could not life adorn, And that th' Almighty made a louse in scorn. Yet, if to genealogy we go. The louse is of the elder house, I trow, E'er God (so Moses The louse shows great biblical knowledge. says) did man create, Lo, our first parents walk'd the world in state. Such is the hist'ry of your loyal louse, Whose presence breeds such tumult in the house: Thus, sir, you see no blame to cooks belong; Thus ?, for once, is in the wrong!’ Thus, in the manly tones of Fox and Pitt, To ?, intrepid, spoke the son of nit: Firm in his language to the king of wrath, As little David to the man of Gath; Ordain'd, in oratory, to surpass The speech ? th' immortal speech of Balaam's ass. ‘Lies! lies! lies! lies!’ reply'd the furious ?; ‘'Tis no such thing! no, no, 'tis no such thing!’ Then quick he aim'd, of red-hot anger full, His nails of vengeance at the louse's skull: But Zephyr, anxious for his life, drew near, And sudden bore him to a distant sphere; In triumph rais'd the animal on high, Where Berenice's locks adorn the sky; But now he wish'd him nobler fame to share, And crawl for ever on Belinda's hair: Yet to the louse was greater glory giv'n; To roll a planet on the splendid heav'n. And draw of deep astronomers the ken; The Georgium Sidus of the sons of men!!! A POETICAL AND CONGRATULATORY EPISTLE TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. ON HIS JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES WITH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR JOHNSON. ????????? ???????? ????? ?????? HOMER. O Boswell, Bozzy, Bruce Vide note, page 247., whate'er thy name, Thou mighty shark for anecdote and fame; Thou jackall, leading lion Johnson forth To eat M 'Pherson The translator (but in Dr. Johnson's opinion the author) of the poems attributed to Ossian. 'midst his native North; To frighten grave professors with his roar, And shake the Hebrides from shore to shore— All hail!—At length, ambitious Thane, thy rage To give one spark to Fame's bespangled page Is amply gratified—a thousand eyes Survey thy books with rapture and surprise! Loud, of thy Tour, a thousand tongues have spoken, And wonder'd that thy bones were never broken! Triumphant, thou through Time's vast gulf shall sail, The pilot of our literary whale; Close to the classic Rambler shalt thou cling, Close as a supple courtier to a king; Fate shall not shake thee off with all its pow'r, Stuck like a bat, to some old ivy'd tow'r. Nay, though thy Johnson ne'er had bless'd thy eyes, Paoli's deeds had rais'd thee to the skies! Yes! his broad wing had rais'd thee (no bad hack) A tom-tit twitt'ring on an eagle's back. Thou, curious scrapmonger, shalt live in song When death hath still'd the rattle of thy tongue; E'en future babes to lisp thy name shall learn, And Bozzy join with Wood, and Tommy Hearn, Who drove the spiders from much prose and rhime, And snatch'd old stories from the jaws of time. Sweet is thy page Vide p. 14., I ween, that doth recite, How thou and Johnson, arm in arm, one night, March'd through fair Edinburgh's Pactolian show'rs, Which Cloacina bountifully pours; Those gracious show'rs that fraught with fragrance flow, And gild, like gingerbread, the world below. How sweetly grumbled too was Sam's remark, ‘I smell you, Master Bozzy, in the dark!’ Alas! historians are confounded dull, A dim Bœotia reigns in ev'ry skull; Mere beasts of burden, broken-winded, slow, Heavy as cart-horses, along they go; Whilst thou, a Will-o'-wisp, art here, art there, Wild darting coruscations ev'ry where. What tasteless mouth can gape, what eye can close, What head can nod o'er thy enliv'ning prose, To others' works, the works of thy inditing Are downright di'monds to the eyes of whiting. Think not I flatter thee, my flippant friend; For well I know that flatt'ry would offend: Yet honest praise, I'm sure, thou wouldst not shun, Born with a stomach to digest a tun! Who can refuse a smile that reads thy page, Where surly Sam, inflam'd with Tory rage, Nassau bescoundrels, and with anger big, Swears Whigs are rogues, and ev'ry rogue a Whig? Who will not, too, thy pen's minutiæ bless, That gives posterity the Rambler's dress Vide page 9.? Methinks I view his full, plain suit of brown, The large grey bushy wig that grac'd his crown, Black worsted stockings, little silver buckles, And shirt that had no ruffles for his knuckles. I mark the brown great-coat of cloth he wore, That two huge Patagonian pockets bore, Which Patagonians (wondrous to unfold!) Would fairly both his Dictionaries hold. I see the Rambler Vide P. 376. on a large bay mare, Just like a Centaur ev'ry danger dare, On a full gallop dash the yielding wind, The colt and Bozzy scamp'ring close behind. Of Lady Lochbuy Vide P. 429. with what glee we read, Who offer'd Sam, for breakfast, cold sheep's head; Who, press'd and worried by this dame so civil, Wish'd the sheep's head and woman's at the devil. I see you sailing both in Buchan's Vide P. 104. pot— Now storming an old woman Vide P. 143. and her cot; Who terrified at each tremendous shape, Deem'd you two demons ready for a rape: I see all marv'ling at M'Leod's together On Sam's remarks Vide P. 299. on whey and tanning leather: At Corrichatachin's Vide P. 317., the Lord knows how, I see thee, Bozzy, drunk as David's sow, And begging, with rais'd eyes and lengthen'd chin, Heav'n not to damn thee for the deadly sin: I see too, the stern moralist regale, And pen a Latin ode to Mrs. Thrale Vide P. 177.. I see, without a night-cap on his head, Rare sight! bald Sam in the Pretender's Vide P. 216. bed: I hear (what's wonderful!) unsought by studying, His classic dissertation upon pudding Vide P. 440.: Of provost Jopp Vide page 39., I mark the marv'ling face, Who gave the Rambler's freedom with a grace: I see too, trav'ling from the Isle of Egg Vide P. 275., The humble servant A blacksmith. of a horse's leg; And Snip, the tailor, from the Isle of Muck Vide P. 275., Who stitch'd in Sky with tolerable luck: I see the horn that drunkards must adore; The horn, the mighty horn of Rorie More Vide P. 254.; And bloody shields that guarded hearts in quarrels, Now guard from rats the milk and butter barrels. Methinks the Caledonian dame I see Familiar sitting on the Rambler's knee, Charming, with kisses sweet, the chuckling sage: Melting with sweetest smiles the frost of age; Like Sol, who darts at times a cheerful ray O'er the wan visage of a winter's day. ‘Do it again, my dear,’ (I hear Sam cry) ‘See who first tires, my charmer, you or I.’ I see thee stuffing, with a hand uncouth, An old dry'd whiting in thy Johnson's mouth; And lo! I see, with all his might and main, Thy Johnson spit the whiting out again. Rare anecdotes! 'tis anecdotes like these That bring thee glory, and the million please! On these shall future times delighted stare, Thou charming haberdasher of small ware! Stewart and Robertson, from thee, shall learn The simple charms of hist'ry to discern: To thee, fair hist'ry's palm, shall Livy yield, And Tacitus, to Bozzy, leave the field! Joe Miller's self, whose page such fun provokes, Shall quit his shroud, to grin at Bozzy's jokes! How are we all with rapture touch'd, to see Where, when, and at what hour, you swallow'd tea! How, once, to grace this Asiatic treat, Came haddocks, which the Rambler could not eat. Pleas'd, on thy book thy sov'reign's eye-balls roll, Who loves a gossip's story from his soul! Blest with the mem'ry of the Persian king Cyrus., He ev'ry body knows, and ev'ry thing; Who's dead, who's married, what poor girl beguil'd Hath lost a paramour, and found a child; Which gard'ner hath most cabbages and peas, And which old woman hath most hives of bees; Which farmer boasts the most prolific sows, Cocks, hens, geese, turkeys, goats, sheep, bulls, and cows; Which barber best the ladies' locks can curl; Which house in Windsor sells the finest purl; Which chimney-sweep best beats, in gold array, His brush and shovel, on the first of May; Whose dancing-dogs, in rigadoons excel; And whose the puppet-show, that bears the bell: Which clever smith, the prettiest man-trap His m?y hath planted a number of those truly guardians around his park at Windsor, for the benefit of the public. makes, To save from thieves the royal ducks and drakes, The Guinea hens and peacocks, with their eggs, And catch his loving subjects by the legs. O! since the prince of gossips reads thy book, To what high honours may not Bozzy look? The sunshine of his smile may soon be thine— Perchaunce, in converse thou mayst hear him shine: Perchaunce, to stamp thy merit through the nation, He begs of Johnson's life, thy dedication; Asks questions Just after Dr. Johnson had been honoured with an interview with a certain great personage, in the Queen's library at Buckingham House, he was interrogated by a friend concerning his reception, and his opinion of the r?y?l intellect.—‘His m?y seems to be possessed of much good nature and much curiosity (replied the doctor): as for his ????, it is far from contemptible. His m?y indeed was multifarious in his questions; but, thank God, he answered them all himself.’ of thee, O thou lucky elf, And kindly answers ev'ry one himself. Blest with the classic learning This is a very extraordinary circumstance, as the late p?s d?r retained three parts of the money ordered for the education of her children. The effect of this absurd conduct was so conspicuous in her daughter M?a, that the letters received from her during her residence in Denmark, were absolutely unintelligible. of a college, Our k?g is not a miser in his knowledge: Nought in the storehouse of his brains turns musty: No razor-wit, for want of use, grows rusty: Whate'er his head suggests, whate'er he knows, Free as election beer from tubs, it flows! Yet, ah! superior far!—it boasts the merit Of never fuddling people with the spirit! Say, Bozzy, when to bless our anxious sight, When shall thy volume The Life of Dr. Johnson. burst the gates of light? O! cloth'd in calf, ambitious brat be born— Our kitchens, parlours, libraries, adorn! My fancy's keen anticipating eye, A thousand charming anecdotes can spy: I read, I read of G?ge His m?y's commentary on the quarrel, in which the bishop and the doctor pelted one the other with dirt so gracefully, will be a treasure to the lovers of literature! Mr. B. hath as good as promised it to the public, and, we hope, means to keep his word. the learn'd display On Lowth's and Warburton's immortal fray: Of G?ge, whose brain, if right the mark I hit, Forms one huge Cyclopædia of wit: That holds the wisdom of a thousand ages, And frightens all his workmen, and his pages! O Bozzy, still, thy tell-tale plan pursue: The world is wondrous fond of something new; And, let but Scandal's breath embalm the page, It lives a welcome guest from age to age. Not only say who breathes an arrant knave, But who hath sneak'd a rascal to his grave: Make o'er his turf (in Virtue's cause) a rout, And, like a d?mn'd good Christian, pull him out. Without a fear on families harangue, Say who shall lose their ears, and who shall hang; Publish the demireps, and punks—nay more, Declare what virtuous wife, will be a wh?re. Thy brilliant brain, conjecture can supply, To charm through ev'ry leaf the eager eye. The blue stocking society A club chiefly composed of most learned ladies, to which Mr. B. was admitted. describe, And give thy comment on each joke, and jibe: Tell what the women are, their wit, their quality, And dip them in thy streams of immortality! Let Lord M'Donald threat thy breech to kick A letter of severe remonstrance was sent to Mr. B. who, in consequence, omitted in the second edition of his Journal, what is so generally pleasing to the public, viz. the scandalous passages relative to this nobleman., And o'er thy shrinking shoulders shake his stick: Treat with contempt the menace of this lord, 'Tis Hist'ry's province, Bozzy, to record. Though Wilkes abuse thy brain, that airy mill, And swear poor Johnson murder'd by thy quill; What's that to thee? Why let the victim bleed— Thy end is answer'd, if the nation read. The fiddling knight Sir John Hawkins, who (as well as Mrs. Thrale, now Madam Piozzi) threatens us with the life of the lexicographer., and tuneful Mrs. Thrale, Who frequent hobb'd or nobb'd with Sam, in ale, Snatch up the pen (as thirst of fame inspires!) To write his jokes and stories by their fires; Then why not thou, each joke and tale enrol, Who like a watchful cat before a hole, Full twenty years (inflam'd with letter'd pride) Didst mousing sit before Sam's mouth so wide, To catch as many scraps as thou wert able— A very Laz'rus at the rich man's table? What though against thee porters bounce the door This is literally true—Nobody is at home.—Our great people want the taste to relish Mr. Boswell's vehicles to immortality. Though in London, poor Bozzy is in a desert., And bid thee hunt for secrets there no more; With pen and ink so ready at thy coat, Exciseman-like, each syllable to note, That giv'n to printers' devils (a precious load!), On wings of print comes flying all abroad? Watch then the venal valets—smack the maids, And try with gold to make them rogues and jades: Yet should their honesty thy bribes resent; Fly to thy fertile genius, and invent: Like old Voltaire, who plac'd his greatest glory, In cooking up an entertaining story; Who laugh'd at truth, whene'er her simple tongue Would snatch amusement from a tale or song. O! whilst amid the anecdotic mine, Thou labour'st hard to bid thy hero shine, Run to Bolt Court In Fleet-street, where the doctor lived and died., exert thy Curl-like Curl, the bookseller frequently bribed people to hunt the temples of Cloacina for Pope's and Swift's letters. soul, And fish for golden leaves from hole to hole: Find when he ate and drank, and cough'd and sneez'd— Let all his motions in thy book be squeez'd: On tales, however strange, impose thy claw; Yes, let thy amber lick up ev'ry straw: Sam's nods, and winks, and laughs, will form a treat; For all that breathes of Johnson must be great! Blest be thy labours, most advent'rous Bozzi, Bold rival of Sir John, and Dame Piozzi; Heav'ns! with what laurels shall thy head be crown'd! A grove, a forest, shall thy ears surround! Yes! whilst the Rambler shall a comet blaze, And gild a world of darkness with its rays, Thee too, that world, with wonderment, shall hail, A lively, bouncing cracker at his tail! POSTSCRIPT. As Mr. Boswell's Journal hath afforded such universal pleasure by the relation of minute incidents, and the great moralist's opinion of men and things, during his northern tour; it will be adding greatly to the anecdotical treasury, as well as making Mr. B. happy, to communicate part of a dialogue that took place between Dr. Johnson, and the author of this congratulatory epistle, a few months before the doctor paid the great debt of nature. The doctor was very cheerful that day; had on a black coat and waistcoat, a black plush pair of breeches, and black worsted stockings; a handsome grey wig, a shirt, a muslin neckcloth, a black pair of buttons in his shirt sleeves, a pair of shoes, ornamented with the very identical little buckles that accompanied the philosopher to the Hebrides; his nails were very neatly pared, and his beard fresh shaved with a razor fabricated by the ingenious Mr. Savigny. P. P. ‘Pray, doctor, what is your opinion of Mr. Boswell's literary powers?’ Johnson. ‘Sir, my opinion is, that whenever Bozzy expires, he will create no vacuum in the region of literature—he seems strongly affected by the cacoethes scribendi; wishes to be thought a rara avis, and in truth so he is—your knowledge in ornithology, sir, will easily discover, to what species of bird I allude.’ Here the doctor shook his head and laughed. P. P. ‘What think you, sir, of his account of Corsica?—Of his character of Paoli?’ Johnson. ‘Sir, he hath made a mountain of a wart. But Paoli has virtues. The account is a farrago of disgusting egotism and pompous inanity.’ P. P. ‘I have heard it whispered, doctor, that should you die before him, Mr. B. means to write your life.’ Johnson. ‘Sir, he cannot mean me so irreparable an injury.—Which of us shall die first, is only known to the Great Disposer of events; but were I sure that James Boswell would write my life, I do not know whether I would not anticipate the measure, by taking his.’ (Here he made three or four strides across the room, and returned to his chair with violent emotion.) P. P. ‘I am afraid that he means to do you the favour.’ Johnson. ‘He dares not—he would make a scarecrow of me. I give him liberty to fire his blunderbuss in his own face, but not murder me. Sir, I heed not his ????? ???—Boswell write my life: why the fellow possesses not abilities for writing the life of an ephemeron.’ BOZZY AND PIOZZI, OR THE BRITISH BIOGRAPHERS, A TOWN ECLOGUE. ? Arcades ambo, Et cantare pares, et respondere, parati! VIRGIL. THE ARGUMENT. On the Death of Doctor Johnson, a Number of People, ambitious of being distinguished from the mute Part of their Species, set about relating and printing Stories and Bons Mots of that celebrated Moralist. Amongst the most zealous, though not the most enlightened, appeared Mr. Boswell and Madame Piozzi, the Hero and Heroine of our Eclogue. They are supposed to have in contemplation the Life of Johnson; and to prove their biographical Abilities, appeal to Sir John Hawkins for his Decision on their respective Merits, by Quotations from their printed Anecdotes of the Doctor. Sir John hears them with uncommon Patience, and determines very properly on the Pretensions of the contending Parties. [PART I.] When Johnson sought (as Shakspeare says) that bourn, From whence, alas! no travellers return; In humbler English, when the Doctor died, Apollo whimper'd, and the Muses cried; Parnassus mop'd for days, in business slack, And like a hearse, the hill was hung with black; Minerva, sighing for her fav'rite son, Pronounc'd, with lengthen'd face, the world undone; Her owl too, hooted in so loud a style, That people might have heard the bird a mile; Jove wip'd his eyes so red, and told his wife, He ne'er made Johnson's equal in his life; And that 'twould be a long, long time, if ever, His art could form a fellow half so clever; Venus, of all the little Doves the dam, With all the Graces, sobb'd for brother Sam: Such were the heav'nly howlings for his death, As if Dame Nature had resign'd her breath. Nor less sonorous was the grief, I ween, Amidst the natives of our earthly scene: From beggars, to the great who hold the helm, One Johnso-mania rag'd through all the realm! ‘Who,’ cry'd the world, ‘can match his prose or rhime? O'er wits of modern days he tow'rs sublime! An oak, wide spreading o'er the shrubs below, That round his roots, with puny foliage, blow; A pyramid, amidst some barren waste, That frowns o'er huts, the sport of ev'ry blast; A mighty Atlas, whose aspiring head O'er distant regions casts an awful shade. By kings and beggars, lo! his tales are told, And ev'ry sentence glows a grain of gold! Blest! who his philosophic phiz can take, Catch ev'n his weaknesses—his noddle's shake, The lengthen'd lip of scorn, the forehead's scowl, The low'ring eye's contempt, and bear-like growl. In vain, the critics aim their toothless rage! Mere sprats, that venture war with whales to wage: Unmov'd he stands, and feels their force no more Than some huge rock amidst the wat'ry roar, That calmly bears the tumults of the deep, And howling tempests, that as well may sleep.’ Strong, 'midst the Rambler's cronies, was the rage, To fill with Sam's bons mots and tales the page: Mere flies, that buzz'd around his setting ray, And bore a splendor, on their wings away: Thus round his orb the pigmy planets run, And catch their little lustre from the sun. At length, rush'd forth two candidates for fame; A Scotchman one, and one a London dame; That, by th' emphatic Johnson, christ'ned Bozzy; This, by the bishop's license, Dame Piozzi; Whose widow'd name, by topers lov'd, was Thrale, Bright in the annals of election ale; A name, by marriage, that gave up the ghost! In poor Pedocchio The author was nearly committing a blunder—fortunate, indeed, was his recollection; as Pedocchio signifies, in the Italian language, that most contemptible of animals, a louse.,—no!—Piozzi, lost! Each seiz'd with ardour wild, the grey goose quill; Each sat to work the intellectual mill; That pecks of bran so coarse began to pour, To one poor solitary grain of flour. Forth rush'd to light their books—but who should say, Which bore the palm of anecdote away? This, to decide, the rival wits agreed Before Sir John their tales and jokes to read, And let the knight's opinion in the strife, Declare the prop'rest pen to write Sam's life: Sir John, renown'd for musical palavers Vide his History of Music.; The prince, the king, the emperor of quavers! Sharp in solfeggi, as the sharpest needle; Great in the noble art of tweedle-tweedle; Of music's college form'd to be a fellow, Fit for Mus. D. or Maestro di Capella: Whose volume, though it here and there offends, Boasts German merit—makes by bulk amends. High plac'd the venerable quarto sits, Superior frowning o'er octavo wits And duodecimos, ignoble scum! Poor prostitutes to ev'ry vulgar thumb! Whilst undefil'd by literary rage, He bears a spotless leaf from age to age. Like school-boys, lo! before a two-arm'd chair That held the knight wise judging, stood the pair: Or like two ponies on the sporting ground, Prepar'd to gallop when the drum should sound, The couple rang'd—for vict'ry, both as keen, As for a tott'ring bishopric, a dean, Or patriot Burke, for giving glorious bastings To that intolerable fellow Hastings. Thus with their songs contended Virgil's swains, And make the valleys vocal with their strains, Before some grey-beard sage whose judgment ripe, Gave goats for prizes to the prettiest pipe. ‘Alternately in anecdotes go on; But first, begin you, Madam,’ cry'd Sir John: The thankful dame low curt'sied to the chair, And thus, for vict'ry panting, read the fair: MADAME PIOZZI Sam Johnson was of Michael Johnson born; Whose shop of books did Litchfield town adorn: Wrong-headed, stubborn as a halter'd ram; In short, the model of our hero Sam: Inclin'd to madness too—for when his shop Fell down, for want of cash to buy a prop, For fear the thieves might steal the vanish'd store, He duly went each night and lock'd the door! Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 3. BOZZY Whilst Johnson was in Edinburgh, my wife, To please his palate, studied for her life: With ev'ry rarity she fill'd her house, And gave the doctor, for his dinner, grouse. Bozzy's Tour, p. 38. MADAME PIOZZI Dear Doctor Johnson was in size an ox; And from his uncle Andrew learn'd to box: A man to wrestlers and to bruisers dear, Who kept the ring in Smithfield a whole year. The doctor had an uncle too, ador'd By jumping gentry, call'd Cornelius Ford; Who jump'd in boots, which jumpers never choose Far as a famous jumper jump'd in shoes. Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 5, BOZZY. At supper rose a dialogue on witches, When Crosbie said, there could not be such b?tch?s; And that 'twas blasphemy to think such hags Could stir up storms, and on their broomstick nags Gallop along the air with wondrous pace, And boldly fly in God Almighty's face: But Johnson answer'd him, ‘There might be witches, Nought prov'd the non-existence of the b?tch?s.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 39. MADAME PIOZZI. When Thrale, as nimble as a boy at school, Leap'd, though fatigu'd with hunting, o'er a stool; The doctor, proud the same grand feat to do, His pow'rs exerted, and jump'd over too; And though he might a broken back bewail, He scorn'd to be eclips'd by Mr. Thrale. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 6. BOZZY. At Ulinish, our friend, to pass the time, Regal'd us with his knowledges sublime; Show'd that all sorts of learning fill'd his nob, And that in butch'ry he could bear a bob. He sagely told us of the diff'rent feat Employ'd to kill the animals we eat: ‘An ox,’ says he, ‘in country and in town, Is by the butchers constantly knock'd down; As for that lesser animal, a calf, The knock is really not so strong by half; The beast is only stunn'd; but, as for goats, And sheep, and lambs, the butchers cut their throats. Those fellows only want to keep them quiet, Not choosing that the brutes should breed a riot.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 300. MADAME PIOZZI. When Johnson was a child, and swallow'd pap, 'Twas in his mother's old maid Cath'rine's lap; There, whilst he sat, he took in wondrous learning; For much his bowels were for knowledge yearning; There heard the story which we Britons brag on, The story of St. George and eke the Dragon. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 15. Bozzy. When Foote his leg, by some misfortune, broke, Says I to Johnson, all by way of joke, ‘Sam, sir, in paragraph, will soon be clever, And take off Peter better now than ever.’ On which, says Johnson, without hesitation, ‘George George Faulkner, the printer at Dublin, taken off by Foote, under the character of Peter Paragraph. will rejoice at Foote's depeditation.’ On which, says I, a penetrating elf! ‘Doctor, I'm sure you coin'd that word yourself.’ On which he laugh'd, and said, I had divin'd it, For, bonâ fidê, he had really coin'd it. ‘And yet, of all the words I've coin'd,’ says he, ‘My Dictionary, sir, contains but three.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 141. MADAME PIOZZI. The doctor said, ‘in literary matters, ‘A Frenchman goes not deep—he only smatters:’ Then ask'd, what could be hop'd for from the dogs; Fellows that liv'd eternally on frogs. BOZZY. In grave procession to St. Leonard's College, Well stuff'd with ev'ry sort of useful knowledge, We stately walk'd, as soon as supper ended: The landlord and the waiter both attended: The landlord, skill'd a piece of grease to handle, Before us march'd and held a tallow candle; A lantern (some fam'd Scotsman its creator) With equal grace was carried by the waiter: Next morning, from our beds we took a leap, And found ourselves much better for our sleep. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 55. MADAME PIOZZI. In Lincolnshire, a lady show'd our friend A grotto, that she wish'd him to commend; Quoth she, ‘How cool in summer this abode!’ ‘Yes Madam (answer'd Johnson), for a toad.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 203. BOZZY. Between old Scalpa's rugged isle and Rasay's, The wind was vastly boist'rous in our faces: 'Twas glorious Johnson's figure to set sight on— High in the boat, he look'd a noble Triton! But, lo! to damp our pleasure Fate concurs, For Joe, the blockhead, lost his master's spurs: This for the Rambler's temper was a rubber, Who wonder'd Joseph could be such a lubber. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 185. MADAME PIOZZI. I ask'd him if he knock'd Tom Osborn Bookseller. down; As such a tale was current through the town— Says I, ‘Do tell me, doctor, what befell.’— ‘Why, dearest lady, there is nought to tell: I ponder'd on the prop'rest mode to treat him— The dog was impudent, and so I beat him! Tom, like a fool, proclaim'd his fancied wrongs; Others that I belabour'd, held their tongues.’ Did any one, that he was happy, cry— Johnson would tell him plumply, 'twas a lie: A lady Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 285. told him she was really so; On which he sternly answer'd, ‘Madam no! Sickly you are, and ugly—foolish, poor; And therefore can't be happy, I am sure. 'Twould make a fellow hang himself, whose ear Were, from such creatures, forc'd such stuff to hear,’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 232. BOZZY. Lo! when we landed on the Isle of Mull, The megrims got into the doctor's skull: With such bad humours he began to fill, I thought he would not go to Icolmkill: But, lo! those megrims (wonderful to utter!) Were banish'd all by tea and bread and butter! Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 386. MADAME PIOZZI. Quoth I to Johnson—Doctor, tell me true, Who was the best man that you ever knew? He answer'd me at once, George Psalmanazar! Keen in the English language as a razor. Such was the strange, the strangest of replies, That rais'd the whites of both my wond'ring eyes; As this same George, in imposition strong, Beat the first liars that e'er wagg'd a tongue. BOZZY. I wonder'd yesterday, that one John Hay. Who serv'd as Ciceroné on the way, Should fly a man of war—a spot so blest— A fool! nine months, too, after he was prest. Quoth Johnson, ‘No man, sir, would be a sailor, With sense to scrape acquaintance with a jailor.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 151. MADAME PIOZZI. I said, I lik'd not goose, and mention'd why:— One smells it roasting on the spit, quoth I:— ‘You, madam,’ cry'd the doctor, with a frown, ‘Are always gorging—stuffing something down: Madam, 'tis very nat'ral to suppose, If in the pantry you will poke your nose, Your maw with ev'ry sort of victuals swelling, That you must want the bliss of dinner smelling.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 103. BOZZY. As at Argyle's grand house my hat I took, To seek my alehouse, thus began the duke: ‘Pray, Mr. Boswell, won't you have some tea?’ To this I made my bow, and did agree— Then to the drawing-room we both retreated, Where Lady Betty Hamilton was seated Close by the duchess, who, in deep discourse, Took no more notice of me than a horse. Next day, myself and Doctor Johnson took Our hats, to go and wait upon the duke.— Next to himself the duke did Johnson place, But I, thank God, sat second to his grace. The place was due most surely to my merits— And, faith, I was in very pretty spirits: I plainly saw (my penetration such is) I was not yet in favour with the duchess. Thought I, I am not disconcerted yet— Before we part, I'll give her grace a sweat— Then looks of intrepidity I put on, And ask'd her, if she'd have a plate of mutton. This was a glorious deed must be confess'd! I knew I was the duke's, and not her guest! Knowing—as I'm a man of tip-top breeding, That great folks drink no healths while they are feeding; I took my glass, and looking at her grace, I star'd her like a devil in the face; And in respectful terms, as was my duty, Said I, my Lady Duchess, I salute ye: Most audible, indeed, was my salute, For which some folks will say I was a brute; But faith, it dash'd her, as I knew it wou'd; But then I knew that I was flesh and blood. MADAME PIOZZI . Once at our house, amidst our attic feasts, We liken'd our acquaintances to beasts: As for example—some to calves and hogs, And some to bears, and monkeys, cats and dogs; We said (which charm'd the doctor much, no doubt), His mind was like of elephants, the snout, That could pick pins up, yet possess'd the vigour For trimming well the jacket of a tiger. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 204. BOZZY . August the fifteenth, Sunday, Mr. Scott Did breakfast with us—when upon the spot; To him, and unto Doctor Johnson, lo! Sir William Forbes, so clever, did I show; A man that doth not after roguery hanker; A charming Christian, though by trade a banker; Made too, of good companionable stuff, And this, I think, is saying full enough; And yet it is but justice to record, That when he had the measles—'pon my word, The people seem'd in such a dreadful fright, His house was all surrounded day and night, As if they apprehended some great evil, A general conflagration, or the devil. And when he better'd—oh! 'twas grand to see 'em Like mad folks dance, and hear 'em sing te deum. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 15. MADAME PIOZZI . Quoth Johnson, ‘Who d'ye think my life will write.” ‘Goldsmith,’ said I—quoth he, ‘The dog's vile spite, Besides the fellow's monstrous love of lying, Would doubtless make the book not worth the buying.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 31. BOZZY . That worthy gentleman, good Mr. Scott, Said, 'twas our Socrates's luckless lot To have the waiter, a sad nasty blade, To make, poor gentleman, his lemonade; Which waiter much against the doctor's wish, Put with his paws the sugar in the dish: The doctor vex'd at such a filthy fellow, Began, with great propriety to bellow; Then up he took the dish, and nobly flung The liquor out of window on the dung. And Doctor Scott declar'd, that, by his frown, He thought he would have knock'd the fellow down. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 13. MADAME PIOZZI . Dear Doctor Johnson left off drinks fermented; With quarts of chocolate and cream contented; Yet often down his throat's prodigious gutter, Poor man! he pour'd a flood of melted butter! Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 102. BOZZY. With glee the doctor did my girl behold; Her name Veronica, just four months old; This name Veronica, a name though quaint, Belong'd originally to a saint; But to my old great grandam it was giv'n; As fine a woman as e'er went to heav'n; And what must add to her importance much, This lady's genealogy was Dutch. The man who did espouse this dame divine, Was Alexander, Earl of Kincardine; Who pour'd along my body like a sluice, The noble, noble, noble blood of Bruce! And who that own'd this blood could well refuse To make the world acquainted with the news? But to return unto my charming child:— About our Doctor Johnson she was wild; And when he left off speaking, she would flutter, Squawl for him to begin again, and sputter! And to be near him a strong wish express'd, Which proves he was not such a horrid beast. Her fondness for the doctor pleas'd me greatly; On which I loud exclaim'd, in language stately, Nay, if I recollect aright, I swore, I'd to her fortune add five hundred more! MADAME PIOZZI . One day, as we were all in talking lost, My mother's fav'rite spaniel stole the toast; On which, immediately, I scream'd ‘Fie on her,— Fie, Belle,’ said I, ‘you us'd to be on honour.’— ‘Yes,’ Johnson cry'd; ‘but, madam, pray be told, The reason for the vice is—Belle grows old’ But Johnson never could the dog abide, Because my mother wash'd and comb'd his hide. The truth on't is—Belle was not too well bred, Who always would insist on being sed; And very often too, the saucy slut Insisted upon having the first cut. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 256. BOZZY. Last night much care for Johnson's cold was us'd, Who, hitherto, without his nightcap snooz'd; That nought might treat so wonderful a man ill, Sweet Miss M'Leod did make a cap of flannel; And after putting it about his head, She gave him brandy as he went to bed. MADAME PIOZZI . One night we parted at the doctor's door, When thus I said, as I have said before, ‘Don't forget Dicky, doctor;—mind poor Dick.’ On which he turn'd round on his heels so quick, ‘Madam,’ quoth he, ‘and when I've serv'd that elf, ‘I guess I then may go and hang myself.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 204. BOZZY . At night, well soak'd with rain, and wondrous weary, We got as wet as shags to Inverary, We supp'd most royally—were vastly frisky, When Johnson order'd up a gill of whisky: Taking the glass, says I, ‘Here's Mrs. Thrale.’— ‘Drink her in whisky not,’ said he, ‘but ale.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 483. MADAME PIOZZI . The doctor had a cat, and christen'd Hodge, That at his house in Fleet-street us'd to lodge— This Hodge grew old, and sick, and us'd to wish That all his dinners might be form'd of fish; To please poor Hodge, the doctor, all so kind, Went out, and bought him oysters to his mind; This every day he did—nor ask'd black Frank Dr. Johnson's servant., Who deem'd himself of much too high a rank, With vulgar fish-fags to be forc'd to chat, And purchase oysters for a mangy cat. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 102 SIR JOHN. For God's sake stay each anecdotic scrap; Let me draw breath, and take a trifling nap; With one half hour's reflecting slumber blest, And Heav'n's assistance, I may bear the rest. Aside] —What have I done, inform me, gracious Lord, That thus my ears with nonsense should be bor'd? Oh! if I do not in the trial die, The devil and all his brimstone I defy, No punishment in other worlds I fear, My crimes will all be expiated here. Ah! ten times happier was my lot of yore, When, rais'd to consequence that all adore, I sat, each session, king-like, in the chair, Aw'd ev'ry rank, and made the million stare: Lord paramount o'er ev'ry justice riding, In causes, with a Turkish sway, deciding! Yes, like a noble bashaw, of three tails, I spread a fear and trembling through the jails! Blest, have I brow-beaten each thief and strumpet. And blasted on them like the last day's trumpet. I know no paltry weakness of the soul— No sniv'ling pity dares my deeds control— Asham'd, the weakness of my king I hear; Who, childish, drops on ev'ry death Such is the report concerning his most tender-hearted majesty when he suffers the law to take its course on criminals. How unlike the Great Frederic of Prussia, who delights in a hanging. a tear. Return Sir John wishes in vain—His hour of insolence returns no more!, return again, thou glorious hour, That to my grasp once gav'st my idol, pow'r; When at my feet the humble knaves would fall; The thund'ring Jupiter of Hicks' Hall. The knight, thus finishing his speech so fair, Sleep pull'd him gently backwards in his chair; Op'd wide the mouth that oft on jail-birds swore, Then rais'd his nasal organ to a roar. That actually surpass'd in tone and grace, The grumbled ditties of his fav'rite base The violoncello, on which the knight is a performer.. PART II. Now from his sleep the knight, affrighted, sprung, Whilst on his ear the words of Johnson rung; For, lo! in dreams, the surly Rambler rose, And wildly staring, seem'd a man of woes. ‘Wake, Hawkins,’ (growl'd the doctor, with a frown) ‘And knock that fellow and that woman down— Bid them with Johnson's life proceed no further— Enough already they have dealt in murther— Say, to their tales that little truth belongs— If fame they mean me—bid them hold their tongues. In vain at glory gudgeon Boswell snaps— His mind's a paper kite—compos'd of scraps; Just o'er the tops of chimneys form'd to fly; Not with a wing sublime to mount the sky. Say to the dog, his head's a downright drum Unequal to the history of Tom Thumb: Nay tell of anecdote that thirsty leech, He is not equal to a Tyburn speech Composed for the unfortunate brave of Newgate, by different historians.. For that Piozzi's wife, sir John, exhort her, To draw her immortality from porter; Give up her anecdotical inditing, And study housewifery instead of writing: Bid her a poor biography suspend; Nor crucify through vanity, a friend.— I know no business women have with learning; I scorn, I hate the mole-ey'd half discerning; Their wit but serves a husband's heart to rack; And make eternal horsewhips for his back. Tell Peter Pindar, should you chance to meet him, I like his genius—should be glad to greet him— Yet let him know, crown'd heads are sacred things, And bid him rev'rence more the best of kings This is a strange and almost incredible speech from Johnson's mouth, as not many years ago, when the age of a certain great personage became the subject of debate, the doctor broke in upon the conversation with the following question:—‘Of what importance to the present company is his age?—Of what importance would it have been to the world if he had never existed?’ If we may judge likewise from the following speech, he deemed the present possessor of a certain throne, as much an usurper as King William, whom, according to Mr. Boswell's account, he bescoundrels. The story is this—An acquaintance of Johnson's asked him if he could not sing. He replied, ‘I know but one song; and that is, “The king shall enjoy his own again.”; Still on his Pegasus continue jogging, And give that Boswell's back another flogging.’ Such was the dream that wak'd the sleeping knight, And op'd again his eyes upon the light— Who, mindless of old Johnson and his frown And stern commands to knock the couple down, Resolv'd to keep the peace—and, in a tone Not much unlike a mastiff o'er a bone, He grumbled, that, enabled by the nap, He now could meet more biographics c Then nodding with a magistratial air, To farther anecdote he call'd the fair. MADAME PIOZZI . Dear Doctor Johnson lov'd a leg of pork, And hearty on it would his grinders work: He lik'd to eat it so much over-done, That one might shake the flesh from off the bone. A veal pie too, with sugar cramm'd and plums, Was wondrous grateful to the doctor's gums, Though us'd from morn to night on fruit to stuff, He vow'd his belly never had enough.

One Thursday morn did Doctor Johnson wake, And call out ‘Lanky, Lanky,’ by mistake— But recollecting—‘Bozzy, Bozzy,’ cry'd— For in contractions Johnson took a pride! Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 384. MADAME PIOZZI . Whene'er our friend would read in bed by night, Poor Mr. Thrale and I were in a fright; For blinking on his book too near the flame, Lo! to the fore-top of his wig it came! Burnt all the hairs away, both great and small, Down to the very net-work, named the caul. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 237. BOZZY . At Corrachatachin's, in hoggism sunk, I got with punch, alas! confounded drunk: Much was I vex'd that I could not be quiet, But, like a stupid blockhead, breed a riot— I scarcely knew how 'twas I reel'd to bed— Next morn I wak'd with dreadful pains of head, And terrors too, that of my peace did rob me— For much I fear'd the Moralist would mob me. But as I lay along a heavy log, The doctor, ent'ring, call'd me drunken dog. Then up rose I with apostolic air, And read in Dame M'Kinnon's book of pray'r, In hopes for such a sin to be forgiv'n,— And make, if possible, my peace with Heav'n. 'Twas strange that in that volume of divinity, I op'd the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, And read these words—‘Pray be not drunk with wine, Since drunkenness doth make a man a swine.’ ‘Alas!’ says I, ‘the sinner that I am!’ And having made my speech, I took a dram. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 317. MADAME PIOZZI . One day, with spirits low, and sorrow fill'd, I told him that I had a cousin kill'd: ‘My dear,’ quoth he, ‘for Heav'n's sake hold your canting; Were all your cousins kill'd, they'd not be wanting; Though death on each of them should set his mark; Though ev'ry one were spitted like a lark; Roasted, and giv'n that dog there for a meal, The loss of them the world would never feel— Trust me, dear madam, all your dear relations Are nits—are nothings in the eye of nations.’ Again Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 189., says I, one day—‘I do believe, A good acquaintance that I have will grieve To hear her friend hath lost a large estate.’— ‘Yes,’ answer'd he, ‘lament as much her fate, As did your horse (I freely will allow) To hear of the miscarriage of your cow.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 63. BOZZY . At Enoch, at M'Queen's, we went to bed; A colour'd handkerchief wrapp'd Johnson's head; He said, ‘God bless us both—good night;’—and then, I, like a parish clerk, pronounc'd Amen! My good companion soon by sleep was seiz'd— But I, by lice and fleas was sadly teas'd— Methought a spider with terrific claws, Was striding from the wainscoat to my jaws; But slumber soon did ev'ry sense entrap, And so I sunk into the sweetest nap.

BOZZY . Of thatching, well the doctor knew the art; And with his threshing wisdom made us start: Described the greatest secrets of the Mint, And made folks fancy that he had been in't. Of hops and malt 'tis wondrous what he knew; And well as any brewer he could brew. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 324. MADAME PIOZZI . In ghosts the doctor strongly did believe, And pinn'd his faith on many a liar's sleeve— He said to doctor Lawrence, ‘Sure I am, I heard my poor dear mother call out, ‘Sam.’ ‘I'm sure,’ said he, ‘that I can trust my ears And yet, my mother had been dead for years.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 192. BOZZY . When young ('twas rather silly I allow) Much was I pleas'd to imitate a cow. One time, at Drury Lane, with Doctor Blair My imitations made the playhouse stare! So very charming was I in my roar, That both the galleries clapp'd, and cry'd ‘Encore.’ Blest by the general plaudit and the laugh— I try'd to be a jackass and a calf; But who, alas! in all things can be great? In short, I met a terrible defeat; So vile I bray'd and bellow'd, I was hiss'd— Yet all who knew me, wonder'd that I miss'd. Blair whisper'd me, ‘You've lost your credit now; Stick, Boswell, for the future, to the cow.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 499. MADAME PIOZZI . Th' affair of blacks when Johnson would discuss, He always thought they had not souls like us; And yet, whene'er his family would fight, He always said black Frank The doctor's man servant. was in the right. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 212. BOZZY . I must confess that I enjoy'd a pleasure In bearing to the North so great a treasure— Thinks I, I'm like a bull-dog or a hound, Who, when a lump of liver he hath found, Runs to some corner, to avoid a riot, To gobble down his piece of meat in quiet: I thought this good as all Joe Miller's jokes; And so I up, and told it to the folks.— Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 259. MADAME PIOZZI . Some of our friends wish'd Johnson would compose The lives of authors who had shone in prose; As for his pow'r, no mortal man could doubt it— Sir Richard Musgrove, he was warm about it; Got up, and sooth'd, entreated, begg'd and pray'd, Poor man, as if he had implor'd for bread.— ‘Sir Richard,’ cry'd the doctor, with a frown, ‘Since you're got up, I pray you, Sir, sit down.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 295. BOZZY. Of doctor Johnson, having giv'n a sketch, Permit me, reader, of myself, to preach— The world will certainly receive with glee, The slightest bit of history of me. Think of a gentleman of ancient blood! Prouder of title than of being good— A gentleman just thirty-three years old; Married four years, and as a tiger bold; Whose bowels yearn'd Great Britain's foes to tame, And from the canon's mouth to swallow flame; To get his limbs by broad-swords carv'd in wars, Like some old bedstead, and to boast his scars; And, proud immortal actions to achieve, See his hide bor'd by bullets like a sieve, But, lo! his father, a well-judging judge, Forbade his son from Edinburgh to budge— Resolv'd the French should not his b?side claw; So bound his son apprentice to the law. This gentleman had been in foreign parts, And, like Ulysses, learnt a world of arts: Much wisdom his vast travels having brought him, He was not half the fool the people thought him— Of prudence, this same gentleman was such, He rather had too little than too much. Bright was this gentleman's imagination, Well calculated for the highest station: Indeed so lively, give the dev'l his due, He ten times more would utter than was true; Which forc'd him frequently, against his will, Poor man to swallow many a bitter pill— One bitter pill amongst the rest he took, Which was to cut some scandal from his book.— By Doctor Johnson he is well portray'd: Quoth Sam, ‘Of Bozzy it may well be said, That through the most inhospitable scene, One never can be troubl'd with the spleen, Nor ev'n the greatest difficulties chafe at, Whilst such an animal is near to laugh at.’ MADAME PIOZZI . For me, in Latin, Doctor Johnson wrote Two lines upon Sir Joseph Banks's goat; A goat! that round the world so curious went— A goat! that now eats grass that grows in Kent! Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 72. BOZZY . To lord Monboddo a few lines I wrote, And by the servant, Joseph, sent this note— ‘Thus far, my lord, from Edinburgh, my home, With Mr. Samuel Johnson, I am come— This night, by us, must certainly be seen, The very handsome town of Aberdeen. For thoughts of Johnson, you'll be not applied to— I know your lordship likes him less than I do. So near we are—to part, I can't tell how, Without so much as making him a bow: Besides, the Rambler says, to see Monbodd, He'd go at least two miles out of his road, Which shows that he admires (whoever rails) The pen which proves that men are born with tails; Hoping that as to health your lordship does well, I am your servant at command, JAMES BOSWELL.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 207. MADAME PIOZZI . On Mr. Thrale's old hunter Johnson rode, Who with prodigious pride the beast bestrode; As on Brighton Downs he dash'd away, Much was he pleas'd to hear a sportsman say, That at a chase he was as tight a hand As e'er a sporting lubber in the land. Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 207. BOZZY . One morning Johnson, on the Isle of Mull, Was of his politics excessive full:— Quoth he, ‘That Pulteney was a rogue 'tis plain— Besides, the fellow was a Whig in grain.’ Then to his principles he gave a banging, And swore no Whig was ever worth a hanging, ‘'Tis wonderful,’ says he, ‘and makes one stare, To think the livery chose John Wilkes Lord May'r; A dog, of whom the world could nurse no hopes— Prompt to debauch their girls, and rob their shops.’ Vide Piozzi's Anecdotes P. 424. MADAME PIOZZI. Sir, I believe that anecdote a lie; But grant that Johnson said it—by the by, As Wilkes unhappily your friendship shar'd, The dirty anecdote might well be spar'd. BOZZY. Madam, I stick to truth as much as you, And damme if the story be not true. What you have said of Johnson and the larks, As much the Rambler for a savage marks. 'Twas scandalous ev'n candour must allow, To give the hist'ry of the horse and cow: What but an enemy to Johnson's fame, Dar'd his vile prank at Litchfield playhouse name? Where, without ceremony he thought fit To fling the man and chair into the pit— Who would have register'd a speech so odd On the dead Stay-maker Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 51, first edition. and Doctor Dodd? MADAME PIOZZI. Sam Johnson's threshing knowledge and his thatching, May be your own inimitable hatching. Pray of his wisdom can't you tell more news? Could not he make a shirt, and cobble shoes, Knit stockings, or ingenious, take up stitches— Draw teeth, dress wigs, or make a pair of breeches? You prate too of his knowledge of the Mint, As if the Rambler really had been in't— Who knows but you will tell us (truth forsaking) That each bad shilling is of Johnson's making; His each vile sixpence that the world hath cheated— And his, the art that ev'ry guinea sweated. About his brewing knowledge you will prate too, Who scarcely knew a hop from a potatoe— And though of beer he joy'd in hearty swigs, I'd pit against his taste my husband's pigs. BOZZY. How could your folly tell, so void of truth, That miserable story of the youth, Who, in your book, of Doctor Johnson begs Most seriously to know if cats laid eggs! MADAME PIOZZI. Who told of Mrs. Montague the lie— So palpable a falsehood?—Bozzy, fy! BOZZY. Who, madd'ning with an anecdotic itch, Declar'd that Johnson call'd his mother b?t?ch? MADAME PIOZZI. Who, from M'Donald's rage to save his snout, Cut twenty lines of defamation out? BOZZY. Who would have said a word about Sam's wig; Or told the story of the peas and pig? Who would have told a tale so very flat, Of Frank the Black, and Hodge the mangy cat! MADAME PIOZZI. Good me! you're grown at once confounded tender— Of Doctor Johnson's fame a fierce defender: I'm sure you've mention'd many a prettys tory Not much redounding to the doctor's glory. Now for a saint upon us you would palm him— First murder the poor man and then embalm him! BOZZY. Why truly, madam, Johnson cannot boast— By your acquaintance, he hath rather lost. His character so shockingly you handle— You've sunk your comet to a farthing candle. Your vanities contriv'd the sage to hitch in, And brib'd him with your cellar and your kitchen; But luckless Johnson play'd a losing game— Though beef and beer he won—he lost his fame. MADAME PIOZZI. One quarter of your book had Johnson read, Fist-criticism had rattl'd round your head. Yet let my satire not too far pursue— It boasts some merit, give the Dev'l his due. Where grocers and where pastry-cooks reside, Thy book, with triumph, may indulge its pride; Preach to the patty-pans sententious stuff— And hug that idol of the nose, call'd snuff: With all its stories cloves and ginger please, And pour its wonders to a pound of cheese! BOZZY. Madam, your irony is wondrous fine! Sense in each thought, and wit in ev'ry line; Yet, madam, when the leaves of my poor book, Visit the grocer or the pastry-cook, Your's, to enjoy of fame the just reward, May aid the trunk-maker of Paul's Church-yard; In the same alehouses together us'd, By the same fingers they may be amus'd— The greasy snuffers your's, perchance may wipe, Whilst mine, high honour'd, lights a toper's pipe, The praise of Courtenay The lively rattle of the House of Commons—indeed its Momus: who seems to have been selected by his constituents more for the purposes of laughing at the misfortunes of his country, than healing the wounds. He is the author of a poem lately published, that endeavours, totis viribus, to prove that Doctor Johnson was a brute as well as a moralist! my book's fame secures— Now, who the devil, madam, praises your's? MADAME PIOZZI. Thousands, you blockhead—no one now can doubt it; For not a soul in London is without it. The folks were ready Cadell to devour, Who sold the first edition in an hour— So!—Courtenay's praises save you!—ah! that 'squire Deals, let me tell you, more in smoke than fire. BOZZY. Zounds! he has prais'd me in the sweetest line— MADAME PIOZZI. Ay! aye! the verse and subject equal shine. Few are the mouths that Courtenay's wit rehearse— Mere cork in politics, and lead in verse. BOZZY. Well, ma'am! since all that Johnson said or wrote, You hold so sacred—how have you forgot To grant the wonder-hunting world a reading Of Sam's Epistle, just before your wedding; Beginning thus (in strains not form'd to flatter), ‘MADAM, If that most ignominious matter Be not concluded’— Farther shall I say? No—we shall have it from yourself some day, To justify your passion for the youth, With all the charms of eloquence and truth. MADAME PIOZZI. What was my marriage, sir, to you or him? He tell me what to do!—a pretty whim! He, to propriety (the beast) resort! As well might elephants preside at court. Lord! let the world to damn my match agree; Good God! James Boswell, what's that world to me? The folks who paid respects to Mrs. Thrale, Fed on her pork, poor souls! and swill'd her ale, May sicken at Piozzi, nine in ten— Turn up the nose of scorn—good God! what then? For me, the dev'l may fetch their souls so great; They keep their homes, and I, thank God, my meat. When they, poor owls! shall beat their cage, a jail— I, unconfin'd, shall spread my peacock tail; Free as the birds of air, enjoy my ease, Choose my own food, and see what climes I please. I suffer only—if I'm in the wrong: So, now, you prating-puppy, hold your tongue. SIR JOHN. For shame! for shame! for Heav'n's sake both be quiet— Not Billingsgate exhibits such a riot; Behold, for scandal you have made a feast, And turn'd your idol, Johnson, to a beast: 'Tis plain that tales of ghosts are arrant lies, Or instantaneously would Johnson's rise; Make you both eat your paragraphs so evil; And for your treatment of him, play the devil. Just like two Mohawks on the man you fall; No murd'rer is worse serv'd at Surgeon's Hall. Instead of adding splendor to his name, Your books are downright gibbets to his fame. Of those, your anecdotes—may I be curst, If I can tell you, which of them is worst. You never with posterity can thrive— 'Tis by the Rambler's death alone you live; Like wrens (that in some volume I have read) Hatch'd by strange fortune in a horse's head. Poor Sam was rather fainting in his glory, But now his fame lies foully dead before ye: Thus to some dying man (a frequent case) Two doctors come and give the coup de grace. Zounds! madam, mind the duties of a wife, And dream no more of Doctor Johnson's life; A happy knowledge in a pie or pudding Will more delight your friends than all your studying; One cut from ven'son to the heart can speak Stronger than ten quotations from the Greek; One fat sirloin possesses more sublime Than all the airy castles built by rhime. One nipperkin of stingo with a toast Beats all the streams the Muses' fount can boast; Blest, in one pint of porter, lo! my belly can Find raptures not in all the floods of Helicon, Enough those anecdotes your pow'rs have shown; Sam's life, dear ma'am, will only damn your own. For thee, James Boswell, may the hand of fate Arrest thy goose-quill and confine thy prate; Thy egotisms the world disgusted hears— Then load with vanities no more our ears, Like some lone puppy, yelping all night long, That tires the very echoes with his tongue. Yet, should it lie beyond the pow'rs of fate To stop thy pen, and still thy darling prate; To live in solitude, oh! be thy luck, A chattering magpie on the Isle of Muck. Thus spoke the Judge; then leaping from the chair, He left, in consternation lost, the fair: Black Frank Doctor Johnson's negro servant. he sought on anecdote to cram, And vomit first The knight's volume is reported to be in great forwardness, and likely to distance his formidable competitors. N. B. The quotations from Mr. Boswell, are made from the second edition of his Journal.—Those from Mrs. Piozzi, from the first edition of her anecdotes. a life of surly Sam. Shock'd at the little manners of the knight, The rivals marv'ling mark'd his sudden flight, Then to their pens and paper rush'd the twain To kill the mangled Rambler o'er again. ODE UPON ODE. OR A PEEP AT SAINT JAMES's, OR NEW YEAR's DAY, OR WHAT YOU WILL. ADVERTISEMENT. READER, I think it necessary to inform thee if thou hast not read Mr. Warton's Ode, that I mean not to say that he hath, totidem verbis, sung what I have asserted of him; I therefore beg that my Ode may be considered as an amplification of the ingenious laureat's idea. Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes. HORACE. Just as the maggot bites, I take my way— To painters now my court respectful pay; Now (ever welcome!) on the Muse's wings, Drop in at Windsor, on the best of kings; Now, at St. James's, about Handel prate, Hear odes, see lords and 'squires, and smile at state. PROËMIUM. Know, reader, that the laureat's post sublime Is destin'd to record, in handsome rhime, The deeds of British monarchs, twice a year: If great—how happy is the tuneful tongue! If pitiful—(as Shakspeare says) the song ‘Must suckle fools, and chronicle small beer.’ But bards must take the uphill with the down; Kings cannot always oracles be hatching: Maggots are oft the tenants of a crown— Therefore, like those in cheese, not worth the catching. O gentle reader! if, by God's good grace, Or (what's more sought) good interest at court, Thou get'st of lyric trumpeter the place, And hundreds are, like gudgeons, gaping for't; Hear! (at a palace if thou mean'st to thrive) And of a steady coachman learn to drive. Whene'er employ'd to celebrate a king, Let fancy lend thy muse her loftiest wing— Stun with thy minstrelsy th' affrighted sphere; Bid thy voice thunder like a hundred batteries; For common sounds, conveying common flatteries, Are zephyrs whisp'ring to the royal ear. Know—glutton-like, on praise each monarch crams: Hot spices suit alone their pamper'd nature: Alas! the stomach, parch'd by burning drams, With mad-dog terror starts at simple water. Fierce is each royal mania for applause; And, as a horse-pond wide, are monarch maws— Form'd, therefore, on a pretty ample scale: To sound the decent panegyric note, To pour the modest flatt'ries down their throat, Were off'ring shrimps for dinner to a whale. And mind, whene'er thou strik'st the lyre to kings, To touch to Abigails of courts, the strings; Give the queen's toad-eater a handsome sop, And swear she always has more grace Than ev'n to sell the meanest place— Swear too, the woman keeps no title-shop; Sells not, like Jews in Paul's Church-yard their ware, Who on each passenger for custom stare; And, in the happy tones of traffic, cry, ‘Sher! vat you buy, sher?—Madam! vat you buy?’ Thus, reader, ends the prologue to my ode! The true-bred courtiers wonder whilst I preach— And, with grave vizards, and stretch'd eyes to God, Pronounce my sermon a most impious speech: With all my spirit—let them damn my lays— A courtier's curses are exalted praise. I hear a startled moralist exclaim, ‘Fie, Peter, Peter! fie for shame! Such counsel disagrees with my digestion.’ Well! well! then, my old Socrates, to please thee, For much I'm willing of thy qualms to ease thee, I'll nobly take the other side the question. Par exemple: Fair praise is sterling gold—all should desire it— Flatt'ry, base coin—a cheat upon the nation; And yet, our vanity doth much admire it, And really gives it all its circulation. Flatt'ry's a sly insinuating screw— The world—a bottle of Tokay so fine— The engine always can its cork subdue, And make an easy conquest of the wine. Flatt'ry's an ivy wriggling round an oak— This oak is often honest blunt John Bull— Which ivy would its great supporter choak Whilst John (so thick the walls of his dark soull) Deems it a pretty ornament, and struts— Till Master Ivy creeps into John's guts; And gives poor thoughtless John a set of gripes: Then, like an organ, opening all his pipes, John roars; and, when to a consumption drain'd, Finds out the knave his folly entertain'd. Praise is a modest, unassuming maid, As simply as a Quaker-beauty drest:— No ostentation her's—no vain parade: Sweet nymph! and of few words possest; Yet, heard with rev'rence when she silence breaks, And dignifies the man of whom she speaks. Flatt'ry's a pert French milliner—a jade Cover'd with rouge, and flauntingly array'd— Makes saucy love to ev'ry man she meets, And offers ev'n her favours in the streets. And yet, instead of heeding public hisses— Divines so grave—Philosophers can bear her; What's stranger still, with childish rapture hear her— Nay, court the smiling harlot's very kisses. ODE. Rich as Dutch cargoes from the fragrant East, Or custard-pudding at a city feast, Tom's incense greets his sovereign's hungry nose: For, bating birth-day torrents from Parnassus, And New-year's spring-tide of divine molasses, Fame in a scanty rill to Windsor flows. Poets (quoth tuneful Tom) in ancient times, Delighted all the country with their rhimes;— Sung knights and barbed steeds with valour big: Knights who encounter'd witches—murder'd wizards, Flogg'd Pagans, till they grumbled in their gizzards: Rogues! with no more religion than a pig:— Knights who illumin'd poor dark souls, Through pretty little well-form'd eyelet holes, By pious pikes and godly lances made— Tools! that work'd wonders in the holy trade; With battle-axes fit to knock down bulls, And therefore qualified (I wot) full well, With force the sacred oracles to tell Unto the thickest unbelieving sculls:— Knights, who, so famous at the game of tourney, Took boldly to the Holy Land a journey, To plant, with swords, in hearts, the Gospel seeds; Just as we hole for cucumbers, hot-beds, Or pierce the bosom of the sullen earth, To give to radishes or onions birth:— Knights, who, when tumbled on the hostile field, And to an enemy obliged to yield, Could neither leg, nor arm, nor neck, nor nob stir: Poor devils! who, like alligators hack'd, At length by hammers, hatchets, sledges, crack'd, Were dragg'd from coats of armour—like a lobster. Great (says the laureat) were the poet's puffings On idle daring red-cross raggamuffins, Who, for their childishness, deserv'd a birch: Quoth Tom, a worthier subject now, thank God! Inspires the lofty dealer in the ode, Than blockheads battling for old mother church. Times (quoth our courtly bard) are alter'd quite— The poet scorns what charm'd of yore the sight— Goths, Vandals, castles, horses, mares:— The polish'd poet of the present day, Doth in his tasty shop display, Ah! vastly prettier-colour'd wares. —The poet ‘moulds his harp to manners mild,’ Quoth Tom—to monarchs, who, with rapture wild, Hear their own praise with mouths of gaping wonder, And catch each crotchet of the Birth-day thunder: Crotchets that scorn the praise of common folly— Though not most musical—most melancholy. Ah! crotchets doom'd to charm our ears no more, Although by Mr. Parsons set in score. Drear and eternal silence doom'd to keep, Where the dark waters of oblivion sleep— To speak in humbler English—doom'd to rest, With court addresses, in a musty chest. Yet all the lady amateurs declar'd, They were the charming'st things they ever heard: As for example—all the angels Gideons— That is, my lady, and her daughters fair, With coal-black eyebrows, and sweet Hebrew air— The lovely produce of the two religions: Thus in their virtues, fox hounds best succeed, When sportsmen very wisely cross the breed: And thus with nobler lustre shines the fowl Begot between a game hen and an owl. Sir Sampson too declar'd, with voice divine, ‘Dat shince he haf turn Chreestian, and eat hog, He nebber did hear mooshic half sho fine; No! nebber shince he lefs de shinnygogue.’ His Grace of Queensb'ry too, with eyes though dim, And one deaf ear, was there in wonder drown'd! List'ning, in attitude of Corporal Trim, He rais'd his thin grey curl to catch the sound: Then swore the airs would never meet their matches, But in his own immortal glees and catches Though not a Purcell, his grace is admitted, by many of his musical guests, to be a very pretty catchmaker.. Yet were those crotchets all condemn'd to rest In the dark bosom of a musty chest! Crotchets that form'd into so sweet an air, As charm'd my lady mayoress and lord mayor; Who thought (and really they were true believers) The music equall'd marrowbones and cleavers. Strains! that the reverend bishops had no qualms In saying, that they equall'd David's psalms; But not surpass'd in melody the bell That mournful soundeth an archbishop's knell; Strains! that Sir Joseph Mawbey deem'd divine, Sweet as the quavers of his fattest swine. E'en great Lord Brudenell's A prodigious amateur—without his lordship there can be no rehearsal. self admir'd the strain, In all the tuneful agonies of pain; Who, winking, beats with duck-like nods the time, And call'd the music and the words sublime. Yes, this most lofty peer admir'd the ode; A peer who, too, delights in opera-dancing; Thus sagely both those useful arts advancing, And nobly spreading Britain's fame abroad. So much by dancing is his lordship won, Behind the op'ra scenes he constant goes, To kiss the little finger of Coulon A first dancer at the opera., To mark her knees, and many-twinkling toes. Too, all the other lords, with whispers swarming, Cry'd bravo! bravo! charming! bravo! charming! And majesty itself, to music bred, Pronounc'd it ‘Very, very good, indeed!’ Indulging, p'rhaps, the very nat'ral dream, That all its charms were owing to the theme. Not but some small degree of harmless pleasure, Might in the brace of royal bosoms rise, To think they heard it without waste of treasure; As sixpences are lovely in their eyes. For, not long since, I heard a forward dame Thus, in a tone of impudence, exclaim— ‘Good God! how kings and queens a song adore! With what delight they order an encore! When that same song, encor'd, for nothing flows! This Madam Mara to her sorrow knows.’ ‘To Windsor, oft, and eke to Kew, The r?y?l mandate Mara drew. No cheering drop the dame was ask'd to sip— No bread was offer'd to her quiv'ring lip: Though faint, she was not suffer'd to sit down,— Such was the goodness—grandeur of the cr??n! Now tell me, will it ever be believ'd, How much for song and chaise-hire she receiv'd? How much pray, think ye?’—Fifty guineas—‘No.’ Most surely forty.—‘No, no.’—Thirty.—‘Poh! Pray, guess in reason,—come, again.’— Alas! you jeer us—twenty at the least; No man could ever be so great a b??st As not to give her twenty for her pain.— ‘To keep you, then, no longer in suspense, For Mara's chaise-hire and unrivall'd note, Out of their wonderful benevolence, Their bounteous m?ies gave—not a groat.’ ‘Aye!’ cry'd a second sland'rer, with a sneer, ‘I know a story like it—You shall hear— Poor Mrs. Siddons, she was order'd out— To wait upon their m?j???ies, to spout— To read old Shakspeare's As you like it to 'em; And how to mind their stops, and commas, show 'em: She read—was told 'twas very, very fine, Excepting here and there a line,— To which the royal wisdom did object— And which in all the pride of emendation, And partly to improve her reputation, His m?j???y thought proper to correct: Then turning to the partner of his bed, On tiptoe mounted by self-approbation, A very modest elevation, He cry'd ‘Mind, Charly, that's the way to read.’ The actress reading, spouting—out of breath, Stood all the time—was nearly tir'd to death; Whilst both their m?j???ies, in royal style, At perfect ease were sitting all the while. Not offer'd to her was one drop of beer, Nor wine, nor chocolate, her heart to cheer: Ready to drop to earth, she must have sunk, But for a child, that at the hardship shrunk— A little prince, who mark'd her situation, Thus, pitying, pour'd a tender exclamation: “La! Mrs. Siddons is quite faint indeed, How pale! I'm sure she cannot longer read: She somewhat wants, her spirits to repair, And would, I'm sure, be happy in a chair.” What follow'd—Why, the r?y?l pair arose Surly enough—one fairly may suppose! And to a room adjoining made retreat, To let her, for one minute, steal a seat. At length the actress ceas'd to read and spout Where generosity's a crying sin: Her curt'sy dropp'd—was nodded to—came out— So rich!’—How rich!—‘As rich as she went in.’ Such are the stories twain!—Why, grant the fact, Are princes, pray, like common folks to act? Should Mara call it cruelty, and blame Such r?y?l conduct, I'd cry, Fie upon her! To Mrs. Siddons freely say the same— Sufficient for such people is the honour! E'en I, the bard, expect no gifts from kings, Although I've said of them such handsome things— Nay, not their eye's attention, whose bright ray Would, like the sun, illumine my poor lay, And, like the sun, so kind to procreation, Increase within my brain the maggot nation. So much for idle tales.—Now, Muse, thy strain Digressive, turn to drawing-rooms again. There too was Pitt, who scrap'd and bow'd to ground; And whisper'd majesty, 'twas vastly fine;— Then wish'd such harmony could once be found Where he, each day, was treated like a swine By that arch-fiend Charles Fox, and his vile party— Villains! in nought but black rebellion hearty; Fellows! who had the impudence to place The sacred sceptre underneath the mace, And twisted ropes, with malice disappointed, To hamper or to hang the Lord's anointed. To whom a certain sage so earnest cry'd, ‘Don't mind—don't mind—the rogues their aim have miss'd— Don't fear your place, whilst I am well supply'd— But mind, mind poverty of Civil List. Swear that no k?'s so poor upon the globe; Compare me—yes, compare me to poor Job. What, what, Pitt—hæ? We must have t'other grant— What, what? You know, Pitt, that my old dead aunt Left not a sixpence, Pitt, these eyes to bless, But from the parish sav'd that fool at Hesse. But mind me—hæ, to plague her heart when dying, I was a constant hunter—Nimrod still; And when in state as dead's a mack'rel lying, I car'd not, for I knew the woman's will. And three days after she was dead, Which some folks thought prodigiously profane, I took it—yes—I took it in my head, To order Sir John Brute at Drury Lane;— Had she respected me, I do aver, I shou'd have stay'd at home, and thought of her.’ And mind—keep George as poor as a church mouse— Vote not a halfpenny for Carlton House— This may appear like wonderful barbarity— But mind, Pitt, mind—he gains in popularity. I see him o'er his father try to rise— And monnt an eagle to the skies— But poverty will check his daring flight— Besides, should George receive a grant— He gets the golden orbs I want— Then Civil List deficiences, good night! And hæ! that wicked son-in-law of Brown Mr. Holland, who married a daughter of the late Capability Brown, and who hath several times impertinently troubled the Palace with a bill of two thousand pounds, due for work done by his father-in-law in the royal gardens., Losing all sort of rev'rence for a crown, Hath sent me in a bill so dread— What's very strange too, Pitt, I'll tell ye more— The rascal came into my house, and swore 'Twas a just bill, and that he must be paid; Yes, that he wou'd, he swore—(how saucy! Pitt)— Or send a lawyer to me with a writ. Down sent I Ramus to him o'er and o'er, To say that Brown had gain'd enough— And bid him to the Palace come no more To pester majesty with bills and stuff. What—Pitt, pray don't you think I'm right—quite right?’ On which the premier, with a falt'ring bow, Star'd in the face by Truth—looking I don't know how, Hem'd out a faint assent—Heav'ns, how polite! How pretty 'twas in Pitt, what great good sense, Not to give majesty the least offence! Whereas, the Chancellor, had he been there, Whose tutor, one would think, had been a bear; Thinking a Briton to no forms confin'd, But born with privilege to speak his mind; Had answer'd with a thund'ring tongue, ‘I think your majesty d?mn?tion wrong— I know no moral or prescriptive right In kings to ? a subject of a mite:— Give him his just demand—it is but fit— Such littlenesses look extremely odd— Before me should the matter come, by G?d Your majesty will cursedly be bit— Kings by a sense of honour should be sway'd— Holland must, will, by G?d he shall, be paid.’ Lord Rochford, too, the gentle youth! was there, Whose sweet falsetto voice is often sported In glees and catches; so that all who hear, Believe a pretty semi-vir imported. Anxious to please the royal pair, Lord Salisbury prais'd the words and air; My lord—who boasts a pretty tuneful palate, Who kindly teaches cobblers how to sing, Instructs his butler, baker, on the string, And with Apollo's laurel crowns his valet His lordship made some sad appointments to his majesty's band—ignorant, unmusical rogues, who receive the salary, and thrum by proxy: however he hath behaved better lately, and made atonement, by giving Shield, Dance, Blake, Parke, and Hackwood, to the band.. ‘A cobbler, baker, chang'd to a musician, Butlers, and lick-trenchers!’ my reader roars; ‘The sacred art is in a sweet condition— A pretty way of rubbing out old scores! God bless his generosity and purse:— Soon probably his grandmother, or nurse, May to the happy band unite their notes— Perchance, the list respectable to grace, His lordship's fav'rite horse may show his face, And earn, as chorus singer, all his oats.’ There too, that close attendant on the king, Sir Charles Sir Charles Thompson., the active, elegant, and supple, Join'd with the happy beings of the ring, And bow'd and scrap'd before the sceptred couple; Pour'd high encomium on the birth-day din, And won the meed of many a royal grin. Sir Charles! the most polite, devoted man, Form'd perfectly upon the courtier plan; Watches each motion of the royal lips, And round his majesty so lively skips: Keen as a hawk, observes his sovereign's eye, Explores its wants, and dwells upon its stare, As if he really was to live or die According to th' appearance of the glare: Hops, dances, of true courtliness the type, Just like a pea on a tobacco pipe. Oft will his sacred m?y look down, With aspect conscious of a glorious crown; Look down with surly grandeur on the knight, As if such servile homage was his right; And by a stare, inform the fearful thing, The diff'rence 'twixt a subject and a king. Thus when a little fearful puppy meets A noble Newfoundland dog in the streets, He creeps, and whines, and licks the lofty brute; Curls round him, falls upon his back, and then Springs up and gambols—frisks it back agen, And crawls in dread submission to his foot; Looks up, and hugs his neck, and seems t'intreat him, With ev'ry mark of terror, not to eat him. The Newfoundland dog, conscious of his might, Cocks high his tail and ears, his state to show; Then lifts his leg (a little unpolite) And almost drowns the supplicant below; Then seems, in full-blown majesty, to say, ‘Great is my power—but, lo! I'll not abuse it; I'm Cæsar! paltry creature, go thy way; But mind, I can devour thee, if I choose it.’ Sir Charles at theatres oft shows his mien, Skips from his majesty behind the scene, To make a famous actress blest, by saying, How pleas'd the monarch is—how oft he clapp'd, How oft the queen her fan so gracious tapp'd, In approbation of her charming playing! Then will the knight, with motions all so quick, Rush back again o'erjoy'd, through thin and thick, And to their sacred majesties repair, Loaded with curt'sies, speeches, thanks, fine things! Proud as some old dame's nag with queens and kings Of gingerbread, to grace a country fair. Then will Sir Charles race back, with bold career, With something new, the royal mouths shall utter, Sweet to the actress's astonish'd ear, As sugar plums to brats—or bread and butter; Then back to majesty Sir Charles will fly With the great actress's sublime reply; As for example—‘Dear Sir Charles, dear friend, ‘Pray thank their majesties’ extreme good nature, Who in their goodnesses can condescend To honour thus their poor devoted creature: Whose patronage gives glory to a name— Whose smiles alone confer immortal fame— I beg, Sir Charles, you'll say the humblest things— Commend me to the best of queens and kings.’ Back with the messages Sir Charles will run, And with them charm of majesty the sun, And bid him, like his brother in the skies, Dart smiling radiance from his mouth and eyes! Thrice happy knight! all parties form'd to please! Blest porter of such messages as these! Thus 'midst the battle's rage, like lightning, scours An aid-de-camp, his general's orders carrying; Bravely he gallops through the bullet show'rs, But scarce a single minute tarrying; Then to the general back with answer comes, 'Midst the deep thunder of great guns and drums; Now forth again with more command he sallies, Then back, then forth again behold him hurry; To this that runs away, to that which rallies, All bustle, uproar wild, and hurry scurry! Yet was there one who much the day decry'd— Old Lady Mary Duncan (says report). ‘What, no dear, dear castrato here!’ she sigh'd; ‘Why then—p?x take the roarings and the court; Then Lord have mercy on my tortur'd ears, And shield me from the shouts of such he-bears. Are such the pretty notes to please! Then may I never more hear sounds like these; In days of yore they might have had their merit, Amongst the rams'-horns to have borne a bob, That did at Jericho the wond'rous job— Knock'd down the wall with so much spirit. The sounds may answer to play tricks Amongst a pack of drunken asses; To break, as if it were, with sticks, The bones of bottles and poor glasses, Where, where is Pacchierotti's heart-felt strain? Where Rubinelli's sostenuto note? That tickled oft my sighing soul to pain, That bade my senses in Elysium float? Avaunt! you vile black-bearded rogues—avaunt! 'Tis smoother chins, and sweeter tones, I want.’ My Lord of Exeter was also there, Who, marv'ling, cock'd his time discerning ear To strains that did such honour to a throne— There Uxbridge taught the audience how to think; With much significant and knowing wink, And speeches clad in wisdom's critic tone; Who look'd musicians through with half-shut eyes; Most solemn, most chromatically wise! Sandwich, the glory of each jovial meeting, This fiddler now—now that, so kindly greeting, Appear'd, and shrewdly pour'd his hahs and hums: Great in tatto, my lord, and cross-hand roll; Great in the Dead-march stroke sublime of Saul, He beats Old Assbridge A kettle drummer of great celebrity. on the kettle drums. What pity to our military host, That such a charming drummer should be lost! And feel through life his glories overcast At that dull board The Admiralty., where, never could he learn, Of ships the diff'rence between stem and stern, Hen-coops and boats, the rudder and the mast. Say—'midst the tuneful tribe was Edmund Burke? No!—Mun was cutting out for Hastings, work; Writing to cousin Will and Co. In India., to league 'em Against that rogue, who, like a ruffian, rose, And tweak'd a bulse of jewels from the nose Of dames in India, christen'd Munny Begum. Edmund! who formerly look'd fierce as Grimbald On that most horrid imp, Sir Thomas Rumbold; Vow'd, like a sheep, to flay that eastern thief; Till strange good fortune open'd Edmund's eyes: Oh! then he heard of innocence the cries, And, like Jew converts, damn'd his old belief. Yet, let some praise for Mun's conversion pass To that great wonder-worker, Saint Dundas. Edmund! who battled hard for Powell's life, And swore no man, in virtue, e'er went further; To prove which oath, this Powell took a knife, And made the world believe it, by self murther. Reader, suppose I give thee a small ode, Made when vile Tippoo Saib in triumph rode, And play'd the devil on our Indian borders, In person, or by vile Satanic orders: When Mr. Burke, so famous for fine speeches, From trope to trope, a downright rabbit skipping, And give the noble governor a whipping? Meant, school boy like to take down Hastings' breeches If rightly, reader, I translate thy phiz, Thou smil'st consent—I thank thee—Here it is. But mark my cleanliness ere I begin: Know, I've not caught the itch of party sin; To Pitt, or Fox, I never did belong; Truth, truth I seek—so help me god of song! P'rhaps to a Heathen oath thou mayst demur: Well then—suspicion that I mayst incur, But, like a Christian, swear I do not sham— By all the angels of yon lofty sky, Where burning seraphims and cherubs cry, I'm of no party—curse me if I am! By all those wonder-monger saints and martyrs, Cut, for the love of God, in halves and quarters; By each black soul in purgatory frying; By all those whiter souls, though we can't see 'em, Singing their Ave Mary and Te Deum On yon bright cloud—I swear I am not lying. No! free as air the muse shall spread her wing, Of whom, and when, and what, she pleases, sing; Though privy councils This is a piece of secret history., jealous of her note, Prescrib'd, of late, a halter for her throat. Let folly spring—my eagle, falcon, kite, Hawk—satire—what you will—shall mark her flight; Through huts or palaces ('tis just the same), With equal rage, pursue the panting game; And lay (by princes, or by peasants, bred) Low at the owner's feet, the cuckow, dead. ODE TO EDMUND. Much edified am I by Edmund Burke! Well pleas'd I see his mill-like mouth at work, Grinding away for poor Old England's good: He gives of Elocution such a feast! He tells of such dread doings in the East! And sighs, as 'twere, for his own flesh and blood. Shroff, Chout, Lack, Omra, Dustuck, Nabob, Bunder, Crore, Choultry, Begum, leave his lips in thunder. With matchless pathos, Mun describes the gag, Employ'd by that vile son of Hyder Naig, Nam'd Tippoo—Gags! that British mouths detest! Occasion'd partly by that man so sad, That Hastings!—oh! deserving all that's bad— That villian, murd'rer, tyrant, dog, wild beast! Poor Edmund sees poor Britain's setting sun; Poor Edmund groans—and Britain is undone! Reader! thou hast, I do presume, (God knows though) been in a snug room, By coals or wood made comfortably warm, And often fancied that a storm without, Hath made a diabolic rout— Sunk ships—tore trees up—done a world of harm. Yes! thou hast lifted up thy tearful eyes, Fancying thou heardst of mariners the cries; And sigh'd, ‘How wretched now must thousands be! ‘Oh! how I pity the poor souls at sea!’ When, lo! this dreadful tempest, and his roar, A zephyr—in the key-hole of the door! Now, may not Edmund's howlings be a sigh Pressing through Edmund's lungs for loaves and fishes, On which he long hath look'd with longing eye, To fill poor Edmund's not o'er burden'd dishes? Give Mun a sop—forgot will be complaint; Britain be safe, and Hastings prove a saint. NOW for the drawing-room—O Muse, so madding, Delighted in digression to be gadding. Hampden and Fortescue (brave names!) attended— The last in catches wonderfully mended. The lovely Lady Clarges too was there, To all the graces as to music born: Whose notes so sweetly melting soothes the ear! Soft as the robin's to the blush of morn! There too the rare Viol-di-gamba Pratt, Whose fingers fair the strings so nicely pat, And bow that brings out sounds unknown at Babel— Though not so sweet as those of Mr. Abel. Dear maid! the daughter of that prince of Pratts, Who music cons as well as law; and swears The girl shall scrub no soul's but Handel's airs, To whom he thinks our great composers, cats: Id est, Sacchini, Haydn, Bacch, and Gluck, And twenty more, who never had the luck To please the nicer ears of some crown'd folk; Ears that, like other people's though they grow, Poor creatures! really want the sense to know Psalm tunes so mournful from the old Black Joke. That musty music-hunter too—Mus. D. Much travel'd Burney, came to hear and see; He, in his tour, who found such great protectors— Kings, queens, dukes, margraves, margravines, electors, Who ask'd the doctor many a gracious question, And treated him with marv'lous hospitality; Guessing he had as clever a digestion For meat and drink, as music of rare quality— Not with much glee the doctor heard the ode, But turn'd his disappointed eyes to God; And wish'd it his own setting, with a sigh!— For, ere to Salisbury's house the doctor came— To get, as ode-setter, enroll'd his name— Behold! behold the wedding was gone by. Ah! how unlucky that the prize was lost! Parsons, who, daring, dash'd through thick and thin— Eclipse the second!—got like lightning in, When Burney just had reach'd the distance post. Yet, gentle Muse, let candour this allow That, though his heart was mortified enow, The doctor did his rivals heart admire, And own'd his maiden crotchets full of fire— Crotchets! though sweet alas! condemn'd to lie, Like royal virtues, hid from mortal eye! Crotchets that songful Mr. Parsons ties To Tom's big phrase, to make sublimer cries; Thrice happy union to entrance the soul! How like the notes of cats, a vocal pair, By boys (to catch their wild and mingled air) Tied tail to tail, and thrown across a pole! But where was great Sir Watkyn all this time? Why heard he not the air and lofty rhime? The sleek Welsh deity, who music knows— The Alexander of the Tot'n'am troops Sir Watkyn is a member of the ancient music concert in Tottenham Street, and much attended to, both for his art and science., Who, tutor'd by his stampings, nods, grunts, whoops, Do wondrous execution with their bows? Sir Watkyn, deep in dismal dudgeon gone, Far in his Cambrian villa Wynnestay. sat alone; To Mrs. Walsingham The quarrel between the knight and the lady was a wonderful one—Tantæne animis cœlestibus iræ? he scrubb'd his base, Whilst anger swell'd the volume of his face, Flaming, like suns of London in a fog; Of Mrs. Walsingham he sung with ire; His eyes as red as ferret's eyes, with fire; His mighty soul for vengeance all agog. Achilles thus, affronted to the beard, His sledge-like fist o'er Agamemnon rear'd, And down his throat wou'd fain his words have ramm'd; Who, after oaths (a pretty decent volley), And rating the long monarch for his folly, Inform'd the king of men he might be d?mn'd; Then to his tent majestic strode, to strum, And scrape his anger out on tweedle-dum. Yet Mrs. Walsingham the ode attended; From 'squire Apollo lineally descended— A dame who dances, paints, and plays, and sings; The saint Cecilia,—queen of wind and strings! Though scarcely bigger than a cat—a dame 'Midst the Bas Bleus, a giant as to fame. When fiddle, hautboy, clarinet, bassoon, On Sunday (deem'd by us good Christians, odd) Unite their clang, and pour their merry tune In jiggish gratitude to God; Lo! if a witless member should desire, Instead of Handel, strains perchance of Haydn, A fierce Semiramis she flames with fire— This Amazonian, crotchet-loving maiden! She looks at him with such a pair of eyes!— Reader, by way of simile-digression, Which to my subject happily applies— Didst ever see Grimalkin in a passion, Lifting her back, and ears, and tail, and hair; Giving her two expressive goglers, (Not in the sweet and tender style of oglers) A fierce, broad, wild, fix'd, furious, threat'ning stare? If so—thou mayst some faint idea have Of this great lady at her tuneful club— Who very often hath been heard to rave, And with much eloquence the members snub. Some people by their souls will swear, That if musicians miss but half a bar, Just like an Irishman she starts to bother— And, in the violence of quaver madness, Where nought should reign but harmony and gladness, She knocks one tuneful head against another; Then screams in such chromatic tones Upon Apollo's poor affrighted sons, Whose trembling tongues, when her's begins to sound, Are in the din vociferating drown'd! Thus when the Oxford bell, baptiz'd Great Tom, Shakes all the city with his iron tongue, The little tinklers might as well be dumb As ask attention to their puny song, So much the Liliputians are o'ercome By the deep thunder of the mighty Tom. Handel, as fam'd for manners as a pig, Enrag'd, upon a time pull'd off his wig, And flung it plump in poor Cuzzoni's face, Because the little syren miss'd a grace: Musicians, therefore, should beware; Or in the face of some unlucky chap, Although she cannot fling a load of hair, She probably may dart her cap. Oft when a youth to some sweet blushing maid Hath slily whisper'd amatory things, And, more, by passion than by music sway'd, Broke on the tuneful dialogue of strings; Rous'd like a tigress from a fav'rite feast, Up hath the valiant gentlewoman sprung, With lightning look, and thund'ring tongue, Ready with out-stretch'd neck to eat the beast That boldly dar'd,—so blasphemously rash— Mix with the air divine his love-sick trash. Reader, attend her—she will so enrich ye With music knowledges of every kind, From that poor nothing-monger, old Quilici, To Handel's lofty and capacious mind: Run wild divisions on the various merit Of this and that composer's spirit— On Gluck's sublimities be all so chatty— Talk of the serio-comic of Piccini, Compare the elegance of sweet Sacchini, And iron melodies of old Scarlatti! But not one word on British worth, I ween— Their very mention gives the dame the spleen: 'Twere e'en disgrace to tell their mawkish names: Mere cart-horses—poor uninventive fools, Who neither music make, nor know its rules— Whose works should only come to light in flames. To depths of music doth this dame pretend, Nought can her science well transcend,— If you the lady's own opinion ask; And when she talks of musical enditers, She shows a vast acquaintance with all writers, And takes them critically all to task. Dear gentlewoman; who, so great, so chaste, So foreign in her tweedle-dummish taste, Faints at the name of that enchanting fellow, The melting Amoroso, Paisiello! With notes on Tarchi, Sarti, will o'erwhelm ye: Giordani, sweeter than the Hybla honey: Anfossi, Cimerosa, Bach, Bertoni, Rauzzini, Abel, Pleyel, Guglielmi! Can tell you, that th' Italian school is airy, Expressive, elegant, light as a fairy: The German, heavy, deep, scholastic; The French, most miserably, whining, moaning, Oft like poor devils in the cholic groaning, Noisy and screaming, hideous, Hudibrastic. The female visitors around her gaze, With wond'ring eyes, and mouths of wide amaze, To hear her pompously demand the key Of ev'ry piece musicians play. Astonish'd see this petticoat-Apollo, With stamping foot, and beck'ning hands And head, time-nodding, issue high commands, Beating the Tot'n'am-road director Joah Bate, esquire. hollow. Yes—they behold amaz'd this tuneful whale, And catch each crotchet of her rich discourse, Utter'd with classic elegance and force, On Diatonic and Chromatic scale: Then stare to see the lady wisely pore On scientific zig-zag score. Reader, at this great lady's Sunday meeting, 'Midst tuning instruments, each other greeting, Screaming as if they had not met for years, So joyous, and so great their clatter!—say, Didst ever see this lady striking A Upon her harpsichord, with bending ears? With open mouth, and stare profound, Attention nail'd, and head awry, Watching each atom of the tuneful cry, Till Alamire unison goes round? Didst ever see her hands outstretch'd like wings, Towards the band, though led by Cramer, Wide swimming for pianos on the strings— Now sudden rais'd, like Mr. Christie's hammer, To bid the forte Motions established by the cognoscenti for showing the light and shadow of music. roar in sudden thunder, And fill the gaping multitude with wonder? Thou never didst?—then, friend, without a hum, I envy thee a happiness to come! ‘He molds his harp,’ quoth Tom, ‘to manners mild;’ To kings, for babe-like manners simple styl'd, And grac'd with virtues that would fill a tun; To him the poet humbly makes a leg, Who, goose-like, brooding o'er the favourite egg Of genius, gives the Phœnix to the sun. To him, who for such eggs is always watching, And never more delighted than when hatching; Which makes the number offer'd to the sun, So vast!—why, verily as thick as peas, That people may collect, with equal ease, A thousand noble instances, as one. What numbers, wisdom to his care hath giv'n! All hatch'd—some living—others gone to Heav'n: Thus in the pinnick's A bird so called in some counties, that attends the wise bird, and feeds him. nest the cuckow lays, Then, easy as a Frenchman, takes her flight:— Due homage to the eggs the pinnick pays, And brings the little lubbers into light. The modern poet sings, quoth Tom again, Of m????chs, who, with œconomic fury, Force all the tuneful world to Tot'n'am Lane, And lock up all the doors of harmless Drury The oratorios were to have been performed at Drury Lane, this year, under the conduct of Mr. Linley and Dr. Arnold. Madame Mara was to have exhibited her amazing powers. This would have been a death-stroke to the pigmy performance in Tottenham-court Road. How should the pigmy be saved? By killing the giant—and lo! his death-warrant hath been signed.—By what power of the constitution? None!—Can the Grand Monarque do more? Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.. Say, why this curse on Drury's harmless door, That thus, in anger, m?????y should lock it? Muse, are the Tot'n'am street subscribers poor? Will Drury keep some pence from Tot'n'am's pocket? Doth threat'ning bankruptcy extend a gloom O'er the proud walls of Tot'n'am's regal room? Perchance 'tis Mara's song that gives offence! Hinc illæ Lacrymæ!—I fear: The song that once could charm the r???l sense, Delights, alas! no more the royal ear. Gods! can a guinea deaden ev'ry note, And make the nightingale's a raven's throat? But let me give his m?????y a hint, Fresh from my brain's prolific mint— Suppose we Amateurs should, in a fury, Just take it in our John-Bull heads to say (And lo! 'tis very probable we may)— ‘We will have oratorios at Drury?’ How must he look?—Blank—wonderfully blank; And think such speech an insult on his rank: What could he do?—oppose with ire so hot? I think his m?????y had better not Indeed his m?????y hath prudently taken the hint. Drury, in spite of the royal frown, hath had her oratorios performed, to the no small mortification of poor deserted Tottenham.! Pity a king should with his subjects squabble About an oratorio or a play: It puts him on a footing with the rabble, And that's unkingly, let me say. Suppose he comes off conqueror!—alas! For such a victory he ought to sigh— But, Lord! suppose it so should come to pass, That majesty comes off with a black eye? Whether he lose or win the day, The world will christen it a paltry fray. Kings should be never in the wrong Yet let us give an instance of wrong proceedings. A certain k???and q????, instead of having concerts at their palace, in the style of other princes, such as the king of France, the emperor, the empress of Russia, &amp;c. have entered into a private subscription for a concert in a pitiful street. They pay their six guineas a-piece; and, what is more extraordinary, get in their children, as we are told, gratis! What is still more extraordinary, they have entered into a bond for borrowing two thousand pounds for putting the house into a decent repair; fit for the reception of the k??? of the first empire upon earth. Of whom has this money been borrowed?—Marvelling reader! of the poor musicians' fund!—which money might have been placed out to a much superior advantage. Let me add, that the subscribers order a formal rehearsal previous to every concert; so that, in fact, they get a double concert for their money;—undoubtedly to the vast satisfaction of the fingers of the happy Cramer, Borghi, Shield, Cervetto, &amp;c., who, in this instance, earn their money not very unlike the patient and laborious animal called a drayhorse.— They never are, some wiseacres declare.— Poh! such a speech may do for birth-day song; But makes us philosophic people stare! I know a certain owner of a c???n, Not quite a hundred miles from Windsor town, Who harbour'd of his neighbour horrid notions— A widow gentlewoman—who, he said, Popp'd from her window ev'ry day her head Impertinent, to watch his royal motions. ‘What? what?’ quoth m?????y, ‘I'll teach her eyes To take my motions by surprise— One cannot breakfast, dine, drink tea, nor sup, But, whip! the woman's head at once is out, To see and hear what we are all about: I'll cure her of that trick—and block her up.’ Mad as his military grace Duke of Richmond. For fortifying ev'ry place, From dockyards to a necessary house— The m????ch dreamt of nothing but the wall— The saucy spy in petticoats to maul, And make her eagle pride crawl like a louse. Now workmen came, with formidable stones, To block up the poor widow Jones— Who mark'd this dread blockade, and, with a frown— And to the cause of freedom true— One of the old hen's chicks so blue, Fast as the k??? built up, the dame pull'd down. 'Twas up—'twas down—'twas up again—'twas down; Much did the country with the battle ring, Between the valiant widow and the k???, That admiration rais'd in Windsor town: The mighty battling Broughtons and the Slacks, Ne'er knew more money betted on their backs. Sing, heav'nly muse, how ended this affray: Just as it happens, faith, nine times in ten, When dames so spirited engage with men— That is—th' heroic widow won the day: The k??? could not the woman maul; But found himself most shamefully defeated; Then, very wisely, he retreated, And, very prudently, gave up the wall. Now sing, O Muse, the warlike ammunition Us'd by the dame in her besieg'd condition, That on the host of vile invaders flew; Say, did no god nor goddess cry out shame! And nobly hasten to relieve the dame From such a resolute and hostile crew? Yes—Neptune, like her guardian angel, kind, Join'd the poor Widow Jones, and ran up stairs; Then fiercely caught up certain earthen wares, And, pleas'd his fav'rite element to find, Bid, on their heads, the briny torrents flow, And wash'd, like shags, the combatants below. The goddess Cloacina too, so hearty, Rush'd to the widow's house, and join'd the party: But say, what ammunition fill'd her hand, Fame for the widow to acquire, To bid the enemy retire, And give to public scorn the daring band? What that strong ammunition was, the bard Heard as a secret—therefore must not tell; Nor would he for a thousand pounds reward To beaux reveal it, or the sweetest belle. Yet nature possibly hath made a snout, Blest with sagacity to smell it out. Reader, don't stand so, staring like a calf— Thy gaping attitude provokes my laugh— Thou thinkst that monarchs never can act ill: Get thy head shav'd, poor fool! or think so still. Whether thou deem'st my story false or true, I value not a rush. Wilt have another?—‘No.’—Nay, prithee do.— ‘I won't.’—Thou shalt, by Heavens! so prithee hush! But ere I give the tale, my tuneful bride, My lady muse, shall talk of kings and pride. Some kings on thrones are children on the lap— Children, that all of us see ev'ry day— Brats that kick, squall, and quarrel with their pap, Tearing, and swearing they will have their way: And what, too, their great reputation rifles, Kings quarrel, just like children, about trifles. Moreover—'tis a terrible affair For kingly worship to be kick'd by fellows Who probably feed half their time on air, Mending old kettles or old bellows. My Lady Pride's a very lofty being, Much pleas'd with people's scraping, bowing, kneeing, Fruitful in egotisms, and full of brags— Her ladyship in nought can brook denial; And, as for insult, 'tis a killing trial, And more especially from men of rags. For Pride, such is her stateliness, alas! Rather than feel the kickings of an ass, Would calmly put up with a leg of horse; Though pelting her with fifty times the force; Nay, though her brains came out upon the ground, Were brains within her head-piece to be found. A KING AND A BRICK MAKER A Mr. Scott.. A TALE. A King, near Pimlico, with nose and state, Did very much a neighbouring brick-kiln hate, Because the kiln did vomit nasty smoke; Which smoke—I can't say very nicely bred— Did very often take it in its head To blacken the great house, and try the k??? to choke. His sacred majesty would, sputt'ring, say, Upon a windy day, I'll make the rascal and his brick-kiln hop— P?x take the smoke—the sulphur!—zounds!— It forces down my throat by pounds— My belly is a downright blacksmith's shop.’ One day,—he was so pester'd by a cloud— He could not bear it, and thus bawl'd aloud: ‘Go,’ roar'd his m?????y unto a page, Work'd, like a lion, to a dev'lish rage, ‘Go, tell the rascal who the brick-kiln owns, That if he dares to burn another brick, Black all my house like hell, and make me sick, I'll tear his kiln to rags, and break his bones.’ Off Billy Ramus sat, his errand told: On which the brickmaker—a little bold, Exclaim'd, ‘He break my bones, good master page, He say my kiln shan't burn another brick, Because it blacks his house and makes him sick! Billy, go, give my love to master's rage, And say, more bricks I am resolv'd to burn; And if the smoke his worship's stomach turn, Tell him to stop his mouth and snout— Nay more, good page—his m?????y shall find I'll always take th' advantage of the wind, And, dam'me, try to smoke him out.’ This was a shameful message to a k???, From a poor ragged rogue that dealt in mud; Yet, though so impudent a thing, The fellow's rhet'ric could not be withstood. Stiff as against poor Hastings, Edmund Burke, This brickmaker went tooth and nail to work, And form'd a true Vesuvius on the eye: The smoke in pitchy volumes roll'd along, Rush'd thro' the royal dome with sulphur strong, And, thick ascending, darken'd all the sky. To give the smoke a nastier stink, Indignant reader, what dost think? The fellow scrap'd the filthiest stuff together, Old wigs, old hats, old woollen caps, old rugs, Replete with many a colony of bugs, Old shoes and boots, and all the tribe of leather. Thus did the cloud of stink and darkness shade The building for the Lord's anointed made, And blacken'd it like palls that grace a burying: Thus was this man of mud and straw employ'd, And at the thought so wicked, overjoy'd, Of smoking God's vicegerent like a herring; Of serving him as we do parts of swine, Thought, with green peas, a dish extremely fine; But, lo! this baneful rogue of brick Fell, for his sov'reign, fortunately sick, And, ere the wretch could glut his spleen and pride, By turning monarchs into bacon—died. The modern bard, quoth Tom, sublimely sings Of sharp and prudent œconomic kings, Who rams, and ewes, and lambs, and bullocks feed, And pigs of every sort of breed: Of kings who pride themselves on fruitful sows; Who sell skim milk, and keep a guard so stout To drive the geese, the thievish rascals, out, That ev'ry morning us'd to suck the cows Is it possible for this story to be true? We would rather give it as apocryphal.:— Of kings who cabbages Mr. Warton says in his Ode, ‘Who plant the civic bay;’ but he assuredly meant cabbages and carrots:—the fact proves it. and carrots plant For such as wholesome vegetables want;— Who feed, too, poultry for the people's sake, Then send it through the villages in carts, To cheer (how wondrous kind!) the hungry hearts Of such as only pay for what they take. The poet now, quoth Tom's rare lucubration, Singeth commercial treaties—commutation— Taxes on paint, pomatum, milk of roses, Olympian dew, gloves, sticking plaster, hats, Quack medicines for sick Christians, and sound rats, And all that charm our eyes, or mouths, or noses. The modern bard, says Tom, sublimely sings Of virtuous, gracious, good, uxorious kings, Who love their wives so constant from their heart;— Who down at Windsor daily go a-shopping— Their heads so lovely into houses popping, And doing wonders in the hagling art. And why, in God's name, should not queens and kings Purchase a comb, or corkscrew, lace for cloaks, Edging for caps, or tape for apron-strings, Or pins, or bobbin, cheap as other folks? Reader! to make thine eyes with wonder stare, I tell thee farthings claim the royal care! Farthings are helpless-children of a guinea: If not well watch'd they travel to their cost! For, lo! each copper-visag'd little ninny Is very apt to stray, and to be lost. Extravagance I never dar'd defend— The greatest kings should save a candle-end: Since 'tis an axiom sure, the more folks save, The more, indisputably, they must have, Crown'd heads, of saving should appear examples; And Britain really boasts two pretty samples! The modern poet sings, quoth Tom again, Of sweet excisemen, an obliging train; Who, like our guardian-angels, watch our houses, And add another civil obligation That addeth greatly to our reputation— Hug, in our absences, our loving spouses. Reader! when tir'd, I'm fond of taking breath: Now, as thou dost admire the true sublime, And, consequently, my immortal rhime, 'Tis clear thou never canst desire my death. Swans, in their songs, most musically die;— If that's the case then, reader, so might I. Let me, then, join thy wishes—stay my rapture, And nurse my lungs to sing a second chapter. IN CONTINUATION. ‘Grant me an honest fame, or grant me none,’ Says Pope (I don't know where), a little liar; Who, if he prais'd a man, 'twas in a tone That made his praise like bunches of sweetbriar, Which, while a pleasing fragrance it bestows, Pops out a pretty prickle on your nose. Were some folks to exclaim, who fill a throne, ‘Grant me an honest fame, or grant me none;’ Such princes were upon the forlorn hope,— Soon, very soon, to reputation dead; Their idle laureats, faith, might shut up shop, And bid their lofty genius go to bed. Muse, this is all well said; but, not t'offend ye, I beg you will not cultivate digression— Plead not the poet's quidlibet audenti; For surely there are limits to th' expression: Then cease to wanton thus in episode, And tell the world of Mr. Warton's Ode. The modern poet, Laureat Thomas says, To Botany's grand island tunes his lays, Fix'd for the swains and damsels of St. Giles, Whose knowledge in the hocus-pocus art Bids them from Britain somewhat sudden start, To teach to southern climes their ministerial wiles: Improve the wisdom of the commonweal, And teach the simple natives how to steal: The picklock sciences, so dark, explain; And to ingenious murder turn each brain. Quoth Tom again—the modern poet sings Of sweet, good-natur'd inoffensive kings; Who, by a miracle, escap'd with life— Escap'd a damsel's most tremendous knife; A knife that had been taught, by toil and art, To pierce the bowels of a pie or tart. Thus, having giv'n a full display Of what our laureat says, or meant to say; I'll beg of Thomas to instruct my ears, Why, in his verses, he should call The knights who grac'd the high-arch'd hall, A set of bears Vide the word Savage, in the laureat's Ode for the New Year.? Why the bold steel-clad knights of elder days Are not entitled to a little praise, Who for God's cause did palace, house, and hut sell; As well as monarchs of the present date, Whose dear religion, of which poets prate, Might lodge, without much squeezing, in a nutshell? ‘What king hath small religion?’ thou repliest— ‘If G????? the Th??? thou meanest—bard, thou liest.’ Hold, Thomas—not so furious—I know things That add not to the piety of ?. I've seen a K. at chapel I declare, Yawn, gape, laugh, in the middle of a pray'r— When inward his sad optics ought to roll, To view the dark condition of his soul; Catch up an opera-glass, with curious eye, Forgetting God, some stranger's phiz to spy, As though desirous to observe, if Heav'n Had Christian features to the visage giv'n; Then turn (for kind communication, keen) And tell some new-found wonders to the queen. Thus have these eyes beheld a cock so stately (Indeed these lyric eyes beheld one lately), Lab'ring upon a dunghill with each knuckle: When after many a peck, and scratch, and scrub, This hunter did unkennel a poor grub, On which the fellow did so strut and chuckle; He peck'd and squinted—peck'd and kenn'd agen, Hallooing lustily to Madam Hen; To whom, with airs of triumph, he look'd round, And told what noble treasure he had found. ‘Ah! Peter, Peter,’ Laureat Thomas cries, ‘Thou hast no fear of kings before thy eyes; Great—little—all with thee are equal jokes, And mighty monarchs merely common folks. Ah wicked, wicked, wicked Peter, know—’ Know what? ‘That monarchs are not merely show; Souls they possess, and on a glorious scale:’ To this I answer, Thomas, with a tale. A duke of Burgundy (I know not which) Thus on a certain time address'd a poet:— ‘I'm much afraid of that same scribbling itch— You've wit—but pray be cautious how you show it; Say nothing in your rhimes about a king— If praise, 'tis lies—if blame, a dangerous thing.’ That is, the duke believ'd the king, uncivil, Might kick the saucy poet to the devil. T. W. Peter, there's odds 'twixt staring and stark mad— P. P. Who dares deny it?—So there is, eg ad! T. W. Thou thinkst no prince of common sense possest— P. P. Thomas, thou art mistaken, I protest— On Stanislaus the muse could pour her strain, Who, dying, sunk a sun upon Lorraine: Too like the parted sun, with glory crown'd— He fill'd with blushes deep th' horizon round. Fred'rick the Great, who died the other day, Had for himself, indeed, a deal to say: We must not touch upon that king's belief— Because I fear he seldom said his pray'rs— Nor dare we say the hero was no thief, Because he plunder'd ev'ry body's wares. I'm told the emperor is vastly wise— And hope that Madam Fame hath told no lies: Yet, in his disputations with the Dutch, The monarch's oratory was not much: Full many a trope from bayonet and drum He threaten'd—but, behold! 'twas all a hum. Wise are our gracious q????'s superb relations, The pride and envy of the German nations— People of fashion, worship, wealth, and state— Lo! what demand for them, in heav'n, of late! Lo! with his knapsack, ev'n just now departed, As fine a soldier, faith, as ever started— Whom death did almost dread to lay his claws on— Old captain what's his name?—Saxehilberghausen Great uncle to our most gracious Q. He died in the emperor's service.; For whom (with zeal, for folks of worship, burning) We once again are black'ned up by mourning; To show by glove, cloth, ribband, crape, and fan, A peck of trouble for th' old gentleman. Ah me! what dozens, dozens, dozens, Our q???? hath got of uncles, aunts, and cousins! Egad, if thus those folks continue dying, Each Briton, doom'd to dismal black, Must always bear a hearse-like back, And, like Heraclitus, be always crying. Great is the northern empress, I confess! Much, in her humour, like our good Queen Bess; Who keeps her fair court dames from getting drunk At an assembly at Petersburgh, some years since, which was honoured with the presence of the empress, one of the rules was, that no lady should come drunk into the room.; And all so temperate herself, folks say, She scarcely drinks a dozen drams a day; And, in love matters, is a queen of spunk. Yet like I not such woman for a wife— Such heroines, in a matrimonial strife, Might hammer from one's tender head hard notes: I own my delicacy is so great, I cannot, in dispute, with rapture, meet Women who look like men in petticoats. Oft in a learn'd dispute upon a cap, By way of answer one might have a slap— P'rhaps on a simple petticoat or gown— Nay! possibly on madam's being kiss'd! And really I would rather be knock'd down By weight of argument, than weight of fist. I like not dames whose conversation runs On battles, sieges, mortars, and great guns— The milder beauties win my soften'd soul, Who look for fashions with desiring eyes: Pleas'd when on têtes the conversations roll, Cork rumps, and merry thoughts, and lovers' sighs. Love! when I marry, give me not an ox— I hate a woman, like a sentry-box; Nor can I deem that dame a charming creature Whose hard face holds an oath in ev'ry feature. In woman—angel sweetness let me see— No galloping horse-godmothers for me. I own I cannot brook such manly belles As Mademoiselle d'Eons, and Hannah Snells: Yet men there are, (how strange are Love's decrees!) Whose palates ev'n jack-gentlewomen please. How diff'rent, Cynthia, from thy form so fair, That triumph in a love-inspiring air; Superior beaming ev'n where thousands shine— Thy form!—where all the tender graces play, And, blushing, seem in ev'ry smile to say, ‘Behold we boast an origin divine!’ See too the Queen of France—a gem I ween! With rev'rence let me hail that charming queen, Bliss to her king, and lustre to her race; Though Venus gave of beauty half her store, And all the graces bid a world adore— Her smallest beauties are the charms of face. T. W. Heav'ns! why abroad for virtues must you roam? P. P. Because I cannot find them, Tom, at home. I beg your pardon—yes—the Prince of Wales (Whose actions smile contempt on scandal's tales) Ranks in the muse's favour high— I wish some folks, that I could name with ease, Blest with his head—his heart—his pow'rs to please— Then Pity's soul would cease from many a sigh! The crouching courtiers, that surround a throne, And learn to speak and grin from one alone, Who watch, like dancing dogs, their master's nod— Are ready now, if horsewhipp'd from their places, At Carlton House to show their supple faces, And call the prince they vilify a God. T. W. Thinkst thou not Cæsar doth the arts possess? P. P. Arts in abundance!—Yes, Tom—yes, Tom—yes! T. W. Thinkst thou not Cæsar would each joy forego, To make his children happy? P. P. No, Tom—no, T. W. What! not one bag, to bless a child, bestow?— P. P. Heav'n help thy folly!—no, Tom—no, Tom—no! The sordid souls that avarice enslaves, Would gladly grasp their guineas in their graves: Like that old Greek—a miserable cur, Who made himself his own executor. A cat is with her kittens much delighted; She licks so lovingly their mouths and chins: At ev'ry danger, lord! how puss is frighted— She curls her back, and swells her tail, and grins, Rolls her wild eyes, and claws the backs of curs Who smell too curious to her children's furs. This happens whilst her cats are young indeed; But when grown up, alas! how chang'd their luck! No more she plays, at bo-peep with her breed, Lies down and, mewing, bids them come and suck: No more she sports and pats them, frisks and purs: Plays with their twinkling tails, and licks their furs; But when they beg her blessing and embraces, Spits, like a dirty vixen, in their faces. Nay, after making the poor lambkins fly, She watches the dear babes with squinting eye; And if she spies them with a bit of meat, Springs on their property, and steals their treat.— No more a tender love she seems to feel;— The dev'l for her may eat 'em at a meal— With all her soul;—the jade, so wondrous saving, Cries, ‘Off! you now are at your own beard-shaving.’ So—to some k??????s this evil doth belong;— Th' intelligence is good, I make no doubt; Who really love their offspring when they're young, But lose that fond affection when they're stout; Far off they send them—nor a sixpence give: I wonder, Thomas, where such m??????hs live!— Should such a m??????h, Thomas, cross thy way, And for thy flatt'ry offer butts of sack; Say plainly that he would disgrace thy lay; And turning on him thy poetic back, Bid, like a porcupine, thine anger bristle; Nor damn thy precious soul to wet thy whistle. CONCLUSION. Think not, friend Tom, I envy thee thy rhime, By numbers, I assure you, deem'd sublime; Or that thy laureat's place my spleen provokes: The king (good man!) and I should never quarrel, Ev'n though his royal wisdom gave the laurel To Mr. Tom-a-Stiles, or John-a-Nokes. Old fashion'd, as if tutor'd in the ark, I never sigh'd for glory's high degrees: This very instant should our Grand Monarque Say, ‘Peter, be my laureat, if you please;’ ‘No, please your majesty,’ should be my answer, With sweetest diffidence and modest grace: ‘The office suits a more ingenious man, sir; In God's name, therefore, let him have the place: Unlike the poets, 'tis my vast affliction To be a miserable hand at fiction. But, sir, I'll find some lyric undertaker, Acrostic, rebus, or conundrum-maker, Who oft hath rode on Pegasus so fiery, And won the sweepstakes in the Ladies Diary; Such, Sire, in poetry shall hitch your name, And do sufficient justice to your fame.’ AN APOLOGETIC POSTSCRIPT TO ODE UPON ODE. Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est. HORACE. The bard whose verse can charm the best of kings, Performeth most extraordinary things! THE ARGUMENT. Peter nobly acknowledgeth Error, suspecteth an interfering Devil, and supplicateth his Reader.—He boasteth, wittily parodieth, and most learnedly quoteth a Latin Poet—He showeth much Affection for Kings, illustrating it by a beautiful Simile—Peter again waxeth witty—Resolution declared for Rhime in consequence of Encouragement from our two Universities—Peter wickedly accused of King-roasting; refuteth the malevolent Charge by a most apt Illustration—Peter criticiseth the Blunders of the Stars—Peter replieth to the Charges brought against him by the World—He displayeth great Bible Knowledge, and maketh a shrewd Observation on King David, Uriah, and the Sheep, such as no Commentator ever made before—Peter challengeth Courtiers to equal his Intrepidity, and proveth his Superiority of Courage by giving a delectable Tale of Dumplings—Peter answereth the Unbelief of a vociferous World—Declareth totis viribus love for Kings—Peter peepeth into Futurity, and telleth the Fortune of the Prince of Wales —He descanteth on the high Province of ancient Poets, and displayeth classical Erudition—Peter holdeth Conference with a Quaker—Peter, as usual, turneth rank Egotist—He telleth strange News relating to Majesty and Pepper Arden—Peter apologiseth for Impudence by a Tale of a French King—Peter, imitating Ovid, who was transported for his impudent Ballads, talketh to his Ode—Suggesteth a royal Answer to Ode and Odefactors—Happily selecteth a story of King Canute, illustrating the Danger of stopping the Mouths of Poets with Halters, &amp;c. instead of Meat—Peter concludeth with a wise Observation. Reader, I solemnly protest I thought that I had work'd up all my rhime What stupid demon hath my brain possess'd? I prithee pardon me this time: Afford thy patience through more ode; 'Tis not a vast extent of road: Together let us gallop then along: Most nimbly shall old Pegasus, my hack, stir, To drop the image—prithee hear more song Some ‘more last words of Mr. Baxter.’ A wondrous fav'rite with the tuneful throng, Sublimely great are Peter's pow'rs of song: His nerve of satire, too, so very tough, Strong without weakness, without softness rough. What Horace said of streams in easy lay The marv'ling world of Peter's tongue may say; His tongue, so copious in a flux of metre, ‘Labitur et labetur!’ ODE. World! stop thy mouth—I am resolv'd to rhime— I cannot throw away a vein sublime: If I may take the liberty to brag, I cannot, like the fellow in the Bible, Venting upon his master a rank libel, Conceal my talent in a rag. Kings must continue still to be my theme— Eternally of kings I dream: As beggars ev'ry night, we must suppose, Dream of their vermin, in their beds; Because, as ev'ry body knows, Such things are always running in their heads. Besides—were I to write of common folks, No soul would buy my rhimes so strange, and jokes: Then what becomes of mutton, beef, and pork— How would my masticating muscles work? Indeed, I dare not say they would be idle, But, like my Pegasus's chops, so stout, Who plays and wantons with his bridle, And nobly flings the foam about; So mine would work—‘On what?’ my reader cries, With a stretch'd pair of unbelieving eyes— Heav'n help thy most unpenetrating wit! On a hard morsel—Hunger's iron bit. By all the rhiming goddesses and gods I will—I must, persist in odes— And not a pow'r on earth shall hinder— I hear both Universities The violence of the Universities on this occasion may probably arise from the contempt thrown on them by his majesty's sending the royal children to Gottingen for education; but have not their majesties amply made it up to Oxford by a visit to that celebrated seminary—and is not Cambridge to receive the same honour? exclaim, ‘Peter, it is a glorious road to fame; ‘Eugè poeta magne—well said, Pindar?’ Yet some approach with apostolic face, And cry, ‘O Peter what a want of grace Thus in thy rhime to roast a king?’ I roast a king! by heav'ns 'tis not a fact— I scorn such wicked and disloyal act— Who dares assert it, says a sland'rous thing. Hear what I have to say of kings— If, unsublime, they deal in childish things, And yield not, of reform, a ray of hope; Each mighty monarch straight appears to me A roaster of himself—Felo de se— I only act as cook, and dish him up. Reader! another simile as rare— My verses form a sort of bill of fare, Informing guests what kind of flesh and fish Is to be found within each dish; That eating people may not be mistaken, And take, for ortolan, a lump of bacon. Whenever I have heard of kings Who place in gossipings, and news their pride, And knowing family concerns—mean things! Very judiciously, indeed, I've cry'd, ‘I wonder How their blind stars could make so gross a blunder!’ Instead of sitting on a throne In purple rich—of state so full, They should have had an apron on, And, seated on a three-legg'd stool, Commanded of dead hair, the sprigs To do their duty upon wigs. By such mistakes, is nature often foil'd: Such improprieties should never spring— Thus a fine chattering barber may be spoil'd, To make a most indiff'rent king.’ ‘Sir, sir,’ I hear the world exclaim, ‘At too high game you impudently aim— How dare you with your jokes and gibes, Tread, like a horse, on kingly kibes?’ Folks, who can't see their errors, can't reform: No plainer axiom ever came from man; And 'tis a Christian's duty, in a storm, To save his sinking neighbour, if he can: Thus I to kings my ode of wisdom pen, Because your kings have souls like common men. The Bible warrants me to speak the truth— Nor mealy-mouth'd my tongue in silence keep: Did not good Nathan tell that buckish youth, David the king, that he stole sheep? Stole poor Uriah's little fav'rite lamb— An ewe it chanc'd to be, and not a ram— For had it been a ram, the royal glutton Had never meddled with Uriah's mutton. What modern courtier, pray hath got the face To say to majesty, ‘O king! At such a time, in such a place, You did a very foolish thing?’ What courtier, not a foe to his own glory, Would publish of his king this simple story?— THE APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A KING. Once on a time, a monarch, tir'd with whooping, Whipping and spurring, Happy in worrying A poor, defenceless, harmless buck (The horse and rider wet as muck), From his high consequence and wisdom stooping, Enter'd, through curiosity, a cot, Where sat a poor old woman and her pot. The wrinkled, blear-ey'd, good, old granny, In this same cot, illum'd by many a cranny, Had finish'd apple dumplings for her pot: In tempting row the naked dumplings lay, When, lo! the monarch, in his usual way, Like lightning spoke, ‘What's this? what's this? what? what?’ Then taking up a dumpling in his hand, His eyes with admiration did expand— And oft did majesty the dumpling grapple: ‘'Tis monstrous, monstrous hard, indeed,’ he cry'd: What makes it, pray, so hard?’—The dame reply'd, Low curt'sying, ‘Please your majesty, the apple.’ ‘Very astonishing, indeed!—strange thing!’ (Turning the dumpling round, rejoin'd the king), ‘'Tis most extraordinary then, all this is— It beats Pinetti's conjuring all to pieces— Strange I should never of a dumpling dream— But, goody, tell me where, where, where's the seam?’ ‘Sir, there's no seam,’ quoth she; ‘I never knew That folks did apple dumplings sew.’— ‘No!’ cry'd the staring monarch with a grin, ‘How, how the devil got the apple in?’ On which the dame the curious scheme reveal'd By which the apple lay so sly conceal'd, Which made the Solomon of Britain start; Who to the Palace with full speed repair'd, And queen and princesses so beauteous scar'd, All with the wonders of the dumpling art! There did he labour one whole week, to show The wisdom of an apple-dumpling maker; And, lo! so deep was majesty in dough, The palace seem'd the lodging of a baker. Reader, thou likest not my tale—look'st blue— Thou art a courtier—roarest ‘Lies, lies, lies!’ Do, for a moment, stop thy cries— I tell thee, roaring infidel, 'tis true. Why should it not be true?—The greatest men May ask a foolish question now and then— This is the language of all ages: Folly lays many a trap—we can't escape it: ‘Nemo,’ says some one, ‘omnibus horis sapit:’ Then why not kings, like me and other sages? Far from despising kings, I like the breed, Provided king-like they behave: Kings are an instrument we need, Just as we razors want—to shave; To keep the state's face smooth—give it an air— Like my Lord North's, so jolly, round, and fair. My sense of kings though freely I impart— I hate not royalty, Heav'n knows my heart. Princes and princesses I like, so loyal— Great George's children are my great delight; The sweet Augusta, and sweet Princess Royal, Obtain my love by day, and pray'rs by night. Yes! I like kings, and oft look back with pride Upon the Edwards, Harrys of our isle— Great souls! in virtue as in valour try'd, Whose actions bid the cheek of Britons smile. Muse! let us also forward look, And take a peep into Fate's book. Behold! the sceptre young Augustus sways; I hear the mingled praise of millions rise; I see uprais'd to Heav'n their ardent eyes; That for their monarch ask a length of days. Bright in the brightest annals of renown, Behold fair fame his youthful temples crown With laurels of unfading bloom; Behold dominion swell beneath his care, And genius, rising from a dark despair, His long-extinguish'd fires relume. Such are the kings that suit my taste, I own— Not those where all the littlenesses join— Whose souls should start to find their lot a throne, And blush to show their noses on a coin. Reader, for fear of wicked applications, I now allude to kings of foreign nations. Poets (so unimpeach'd tradition says) The sole historians were of ancient days, Who help'd their heroes fame's high hill to clamber Penning their glorious acts in language strong, And thus preserving, by immortal song, Their names amidst their tuneful amber. What am I doing? Lord! the very same— Preserving many a deed deserving fame, Which that old lean, devouring shark, call'd Time, Would, without ceremony, eat; In my opinion, far too rich a treat— I therefore merit statues for my rhime. ‘All this is laudable,’ a quaker cries, ‘But let grave wisdom, friend, thy verses rule; Put out thine irony's two squinting eyes— Despise thy grinning monkey, ridicule.’ What! slight my sportive monkey, ridicule, Who acts like birch on boys at school, Neglecting lessons—truant, perhaps, whole weeks! My ridicule, with humour fraught, and wit, Is that satiric friend, a gouty fit, Which bites men into health and rosy cheeks: A moral mercury that cleanseth souls Of ills that with them play the devil— Like mercury that much the pow'r controls Of presents gain'd from ladies over civil. Reader, I'll brag a little, if you please; The ancients did so, therefore why not I? Lo! for my good advice I ask no fees, Whilst other doctors let their patients die; That is, such patients as can't pay for cure— A very selfish, wicked thing, I'm sure. Now though I'm soul-physician to the king, I never begg'd of him the smallest thing For all the threshing of my virtuous brains; Nay, were I my poor pocket's state t'impart, So well I know my royal patient's heart, He would not give me two-pence for my pains. But, hark! folks say the king is very mad— The news, if true, indeed, were very sad, And far too serious an affair to mock it— Yet how can this agree with what I've heard, That so much by him are my rhimes rever'd— He goes a-hunting with them in his pocket: And when thrown out—which often is the case (In bacon hunting, or of bucks the race), My verse so much his majesty bewitches, That out he pulls my honour'd Odes, And reads them on the turnpike roads— Now under trees and hedges—now in ditches. Hark! with astonishment, a sound I hear, That strikes tremendous on my ear; It says, great Arden, commonly call'd Pepper, Of mighty George's thunderbolts the keeper, Just like of Jupiter the famous eagle, Is order'd out to hunt me like a beagle. But, eagle Pepper, give my love Unto thy lofty master, Mr. Jove, And ask how it can square with his religion, To bid thee, without mercy, fall on, With thy short sturdy beak, and iron talon, A pretty, little, harmless, cooing pigeon? By heav'ns, I disbelieve the fact— A monarch cannot so unwisely act! Suppose that kings, so rich, are always mumping, Praying and pressing ministers for money; Bidding them on our hive (poor bees!) be thumping, Trying to shake out all our honey; A thing that oft hath happen'd in our isle!— Pray, shan't we be allow'd to smile? To cut a joke, or epigram contrive, By way of solace for our plunder'd hive? A king of France (I've lost the monarch's name), Who avaricious got himself bad fame, By most unmannerly and thievish plunges Into his subjects' purses, A deep manœuvre that obtain'd their curses, Because it treated gentlefolks like sponges. To show how much they relish'd not such squeezing, Such goods and chattel-seizing, They publish'd libels to display their hate, To comfort, in some sort, their souls, For such a number of large holes Eat by this royal rat in each estate. The Premier op'd his gullet like a shark, To hear such satires on the Grand Monarque, And roar'd—‘Messieurs, you soon shall feel My criticism upon your ballads, Not to your taste so sweet as frogs and sallads, A stricture critical yclep'd Bastile.’ But first he told the tidings to the king, Then swore par Dieu that he would quickly bring Unto the grinding stone their noses down— No, not a soul of 'em should ever thrive— He'd flay them, like St. Bartlemew, alive— Villains! for daring to insult the crown. The monarch heard Monsieur le Premier out, And, smiling on his loyalty so stout, Replied, ‘Monsieur le Premier, you are wrong— Don't of the pleasure let them be debarr'd— You know how we have serv'd 'em—faith! 'tis hard They should not for their money have a song.’ Ovid, sweet story-teller of old times, Unluckily transported for his rhimes, Address'd his book before he bade it walk; Therefore my worship, and my-ode, In imitation of such classic mode, May, like two Indian nations, have a talk. ‘Dear Ode! whose verse the true sublime affords, Go, visit kings, queens, parasites, and lords; And if thy modest beauties they adore, Inform them, they shall speedily have more.’ But possibly a mighty king may say, ‘Ode! Ode!—What? what? I hate your rhime haranguing I'd rather hear a jackass bray: I never knew a poet worth the hanging. I hate, abhor them—but I'll clip their wings; I'll teach the saucy knaves to laugh at kings: Yes, yes, the rhiming rogues their songs shall rue, A ragged, bold-fac'd, ballad-singing crew. Yes, yes, the poets shall my pow'r confess; I'll maul that spawning devil call'd the press.’ If furious thus exclaim a king of glory, Tell him, O gentle Muse, this pithy story: KING CANUTE AND HIS NOBLES. A TALE. Canute was by his nobles taught to fancy, That by a kind of royal necromancy, He had the pow'r Old Ocean to control— Down rush'd the royal Dane upon the strand. And issued, like a Solomon, command— Poor soul! ‘Go back, ye waves, you blust'ring rogues!’ quoth he, ‘Touch not your lord and master, Sea, For by my pow'r almighty, if you do’— Then staring vengeance—out he held a stick, Vowing to drive Old Ocean to Old Nick, Should he ev'n wet the latchet of his shoe. The Sea retir'd—the monarch fierce rush'd on, And look'd as if he'd drive him from the land— But Sea, not caring to be put upon, Made for a moment a bold stand: Not only make a stand did Mr. Ocean, But to his honest waves he made a motion, And bid them give the king a hearty trimming: The orders seem'd a deal the waves to tickle, For soon they put his majesty in pickle; And set his royalties, like geese, a-swimming. All hands aloft, with one tremendous roar, Soon did they make him wish himself on shore; His head and ears most handsomely they dous'd— Just like a porpus, with one general shout, The waves so tumbled the poor king about— No anabaptist e'er was half so sous'd. At length to land he crawl'd, a half-drown'd thing, Indeed more like a crab than like a king, And found his courtiers making rueful faces: But what said Canute to the lords and gentry, Who hail'd him from the water, on his entry, All trembling for their lives or places? ‘My lords and gentlemen, by your advice, I've had with Mr. Sea a pretty bustle; My treatment from my foe not over nice, Just made a jest for ev'ry shrimp and muscle: A pretty trick for one of my dominion!— My lords, I thank you for your great opinion. You'll tell me, p'rhaps, I've only lost one game, And bid me try another—for the rubber— Permit me to inform you all, with shame, That you're a set of knaves, and I'm a lubber.’ Such is the story, my dear Ode, Which thou wilt bear—a sacred load! Yet, much I fear, 'twill be of no great use: Kings are in general obstinate as mules; Those who surround them, mostly rogues and fools, And therefore can no benefit produce. Yet stories, sentences, and golden rules, Undoubtedly were made for rogues and fools; But this unluckily the simple fact is; Those rogues and fools do nothing but admire, And all so dev'lish modest, don't desire The glory of reducing them to practice.

Tom, soon as e'er thou strik'st thy golden lyre, Thy brother Peter's muse is all on fire, To sing of kings and queens, and such rare folk; Yet 'midst thy heap of compliments so fine, Say, may we venture to believe a line? You Oxford wits most dearly love a joke. Son of the nine, thou writest well on nought— Thy thund'ring stanza, and its pompous thought, I think, must put a dog into a laugh: Edward and Harry were much braver men Than this new-christen'd hero of thy pen; Yes, laurel'd Odeman, braver far by half; Though on Blackheath, and Wimbledon's wide plain, George keeps his hat off in a show'r of rain; Sees swords and bayonets without a dread, Nor at a volley winks, nor ducks his head: Although at grand reviews he seems so blest, And leaves at six o'clock his downy nest, Dead to the charms of blanket, wife, and bolster; Unlike his officers, who, fond of cramming, And at reviews afraid of thirst and famine, With bread and cheese and brandy fill their holsters. Sure, Tom, we should do justice to Queen Bess: His present majesty whom Heav'n long bless With wisdom, wit, and arts of choicest quality, Will never get, I fear, so fine a niche As that old queen, though often call'd old b?ch, In Fame's colossal house of immortality. As for John Dryden's Charles—that king Indeed was never any mighty thing— He merited few honours from the pen— And yet he was a dev'lish hearty fellow, Enjoy'd his girl and bottle, and got mellow, And mind—kept company with GENTLEMEN: For, like some kings, in hobby grooms, Knights of the manger, curry-combs, and brooms, Lost to all glory, Charles did not delight— Nor jok'd by day with pages, servant maids, Large, red-poll'd, blowzy, hard two-handed jades: Indeed I know not what Charles did by night. Thomas, I am of candour a great lover: In short, I'm candour's self all over; Sweet as a candied cake from top to toe; Make it a rule that virtue shall be prais'd, And humble merit from her bum be rais'd: What thinkest thou of Peter now? Thou criest, ‘Oh! how false! behold thy king Of whom thou scarcely say'st a handsome thing; That king has virtues that should make thee stare.’ Is it so?—Then the sin's in me— 'Tis my vile optics that can't see— Then pray for them, when next thou say'st a pray'r. But, p'rhaps, aloft on his imperial throne, So distant, O ye gods! from ev'ry one, The royal virtues are, like many a star, From this our pigmy system rather far; Whose light though flying ever since creation, Has not yet pitch'd upon our nation Such was the sublime opinion of the Dutch astronomer Huygens.. Then may the royal ray be soon explor'd— And, Thomas, if thou'lt swear thou art not humming, I'll take my spying-glass, and bring thee word The instant I behold it coming. But, Thomas Warton, without joking, Art thou, or art thou not, thy sov'reign smoking? How canst thou seriously declare, That George the Third With Cressy's Edward can compare, Or Harry?—'Tis too bad upon my word: George is a clever king, I needs must own, And cuts a jolly figure on the throne. Now thou exclaim'st, ‘G?d rot it! Peter, pray, What to the devil shall I sing or say?’ I'll tell thee what to say, O tuneful Tom— Sing how a monarch, when his son was dying, His gracious eyes and ears was edifying, By abbey company and kettle drum: Leaving that son to death and the physician, Between two fires—a forlorn-hope condition; Two poachers, who make man their game, And, special marksmen! seldom miss their aim. Say, though the monarch did not see his son, He kept aloof through fatherly affection— Determin'd nothing should be done To bring on useless tears, and dismal recollection. For what can tears avail, and piteous sighs? Death heeds not howls nor dripping eyes: And what are sighs and tears but wind and water, That show the leakiness of feeble nature! Tom, with my simile thou wilt not quarrel: Like air and any sort of drink, Whizzing and oozing through each chink, That proves the weakness of the barrel. Say—for the Prince, when wet was ev'ry eye, And thousands pour'd to Heav'n the pitying sigh Devout; Say how a king, unable to dissemble, Order'd Dame Siddons to his house, and Kemble, To spout: Gave them ice creams and wines, so dear Denied till then a thimblefull of beer— For which they've thank'd the author of this metre, Videlicet, the moral-mender Peter, Who, in his Ode on Ode, did dare exclaim, And call such royal avarice, a shame. Say—but I'll teach thee how to make an ode; Thus shall thy labours visit fame's abode, In company with my immortal lay— And look, Tom—thus I fire away— BIRTH-DAY ODE. This day, this very day, gave birth Not to the brightest monarch upon earth, Because there are some brighter, and as big— Who love the arts that man exalt to Heav'n— George loves them also, when they're giv'n To four-legg'd gentry, christen'd dog and pig The dancing dogs and wise pig have formed a considerable part of the royal amusement., Whose deeds in this our wonder-hunting nation Prove what a charming thing is education. Full of the art of brewing beer, The monarch heard of Mr. Whitbread's fame: Quoth he unto the queen, ‘My dear, my dear, Whitbread hath got a marvellous great name; Charly, we must, must, must see Whitbread brew— Rich as us, Charly, richer than a Jew: Shame, shame, we have not yet his brewhouse seen.’ Thus sweetly said the king unto the queen! Red hot with novelty's delightful rage, To Mr. Whitbread forth he sent a page, To say that majesty propos'd to view, With thirst of knowledge deep inflam'd, His vats, and tubs, and hops, and hogsheads fam'd, And learn the noble secret how to brew. Of such undreamt-of honour proud, Most rev'rently the brewer bow'd; So humbly (so the humble story goes) He touch'd e'en terra firma with his nose; Then said unto the page, hight Billy Ramus, ‘Happy are we that our great king should name us, As worthy unto majesty to shew, How we poor Chiswell people brew.’ Away sprung Billy Ramus quick as thought: To majesty the welcome tidings brought: How Whitbread staring stood like any stake, And trembled—then the civil things he said— On which the king did smile and nod his head; For monarchs like to see their subjects quake: Such horrors unto kings most pleasant are, Proclaiming rev'rence and humility— High thoughts too all those shaking fits declare Of kingly grandeur and great capability! People of worship, wealth, and birth, Look on the humbler sons of earth, Indeed in a most humble light, God knows! High stations are like Dover's tow'ring cliffs, Where ships below appear like little skiffs, The people walking on the strand, like crows. Muse, sing the stir that Mr. Whitbread made; Poor gentleman! most terribly afraid He should not charm enough his guests divine: He gave his maids new aprons, gowns, and smocks; And, lo! two hundred pounds were spent in frocks, To make th' apprentices and draymen fine: Busy as horses in a field of clover, Dogs, cats, and chairs, and stools were tumbled over, Amidst the Whitbread rout of preparation To treat the lofty ruler of the nation. Now mov'd king, queen, and princesses so grand, To visit the first brewer in the land— Who sometimes swills his beer and grinds his meat In a snug corner christen'd Chiswell-street; But oft'ner charm'd with fashionable air, Amidst the gaudy great of Portman-square. Lord Aylesbury, and Denbigh's lord also His grace the duke of Montague likewise, With Lady Harcourt, join'd the raree-show, And fix'd all Smithfield's marv'ling eyes— For, lo! a greater show ne'er grac'd those quarters, Since Mary roasted, just like crabs, the martyrs. Arriv'd, the king broad grinn'd, and gave a nod To Mr. Whitbread, who, had God Come with his angels to behold his beer, With more respect be never could have met— Indeed the man was in a sweat, So much the brewer did the king revere. Her Majesty contrived to make a dip— Light as a feather then the king did skip, And ask'd a thousand questions, with a laugh, Before poor Whitbread comprehended half. Reader! my ode should have a simile— Well! in Jamaica, on a tam'rind tree, Five hundred parrots, gabbling just like Jews, I've seen—such noise the feather'd imps did make As made my pericranium ake— Asking and telling parrot news: Thus was the brewhouse fill'd with gabbling noise, Whilst draymen, and the brewer's boys, Devour'd the questions that the king did ask: In diff'rent parties were they staring seen, Wond'ring to think they saw a king and queen; Behind a tub were some, and some behind a cask. Some draymen forc'd themselves (a pretty luncheon) Into the mouth of many a gaping puncheon; And through the bung-hole wink'd with curious eye, To view, and be assur'd what sort of things Were princesses, and queens, and kings; For whose most lofty station thousands sigh! And, lo! of all the gaping puncheon clan, Few were the mouths that had not got a man! Now majesty into a pump so deep Did with an opera-glass of Dolland peep, Examining with care each wondrous matter That brought up water— Thus have I seen a magpie in the street, A chatt'ring bird we often meet, A bird for curiosity well known, With head awry, And cunning eye, Peep knowingly into a marrow-bone. And now his curious m?????y did stoop To count the nails on ev'ry hoop; And, lo! no single thing came in his way, That full of deep research, he did not say, ‘What's this? hæ, hæ? what's that? what's this? what's that?’ So quick the words too, when he deign'd to speak, As if each syllable would break its neck. Thus, to the world of great whilst others crawl, Our sov'reign peeps into the world of small: Thus microscopic geniuses explore Things that too oft provoke the public scorn; Yet swell of useful knowledges the store, By finding systems in a pepper-corn. Now Mr. Whitbread, serious did declare, To make the majesty of England stare, That he had butts enough, he knew, Plac'd side by side, to reach along to Kew: On which the king with wonder swiftly cry'd, ‘What, if they reach to Kew then, side by side, What would they do, what, what, plac'd end to end?’ To whom, with knitted calculating brow, The man of beer most solemnly did vow, Almost to Windsor that they would extend; On which the king, with wond'ring mien, Repeated it unto the wond'ring queen: On which, quick turning round his halter'd head, The brewer's horse with face astonish'd neigh'd; The brewer's dog too pour'd a note of thunder, Rattled his chain, and wagg'd his tail for wonder. Now did the king for other beers inquire, For Calvert's, Jordan's, Thrale's entire— And, after talking of these diff'rent beers, Ask'd Whitbread if his porter equall'd theirs? This was a puzzling, disagreeing question, Grating like arsenic on his host's digestion; A kind of question to the man of cask, That not ev'n Solomon himself would ask. Now majesty, alive to knowledge, took A very pretty memorandum-book, With gilded leaves of asses' skin so white, And in it legibly began to write— Memorandum. A charming place beneath the grates, For roasting chesnuts or potates. Mem. 'Tis hops that give a bitterness to beer— Hops grow in Kent, says Whitbread, and elsewhere. Quære. Is there no cheaper stuff? where doth it dwell? Would not horse-aloes bitter it as well? Mem. To try it soon on our small beer— 'Twill save us sev'ral pounds a year.— Mem. —To remember to forget to ask Old Whitbread to my house one day— Mem. Not to forget to take of beer the cask, The brewer offer'd me, away. Now having pencil'd his remarks so shrewd; Sharp as the point, indeed, of a new pin; His majesty his watch most sagely view'd, And then put up his asses' skin. To Whitbread now deign'd majesty to say, ‘Whitbread, are all your horses fond of hay?’ ‘Yes, please your majesty,’ in humble notes, The brewer answer'd—‘also, sir, of oats: Another thing my horses too maintains— And that, an't please your majesty, are grains.’ ‘Grains, grains,’ said majesty, ‘to fill their crops? Grains, grains—that comes from hops—yes, hops, hops, hops.’ Here was the king, like hounds sometimes at fault— ‘Sire,’ cry'd the humble brewer, ‘give me leave Your sacred majesty to undeceive: Grains, sire, are never made from hops, but malt.’ ‘True,’ said the cautious monarch, with a smile: From malt, malt, malt—I meant malt all the while.’ ‘Yes,’ with the sweetest bow, rejoin'd the brewer, ‘An't please your majesty, you did, I'm sure.’ ‘Yes,’ answer'd majesty, with quick reply, ‘I did, I did, I did, I, I, I, I.’ Now this was wise in Whitbread—here we find A very pretty knowledge of mankind: As monarchs never must be in the wrong, 'Twas really a bright thought in Whitbread's tongue, To tell a little fib or some such thing, To save the sinking credit of a king. Some brewers, in the rage of information, Proud to instruct the ruler of a nation, Had on the folly dwelt, to seem damn'd clever! Now, what had been the consequence? Too plain! The man had cut his consequence in twain; The king had hated the wise fool for ever! Reader, whene'er thou dost espy a nose, That bright with many a ruby glows; That nose thou mayst pronounce, nay safely swear, Is nurs'd on something better than small beer: Thus when thou findest kings in brewing wise— Or nat'ral hist'ry holding lofty station; Thou mayst conclude with marv'ling eyes, Such kings have had a goodly education. Now did the king admire the bell so fine, That daily asks the draymen all to dine; On which the bell rung out, (how very proper!) To show it was a bell, and had a clapper. And now before their sovereign's curious eye, Parents and children, fine, fat, hopeful sprigs, All snuffling, squinting, grunting in their sty, Appear'd the brewer's tribe of handsome pigs: On which th' observant man, who fills a throne, Declar'd the pigs were vastly like his own: On which the brewer swallow'd up in joys, Tears and astonishment in both his eyes, His soul brimful of sentiments so loyal, Exclaim'd—‘O heav'ns! and can my swine Be deem'd by majesty so fine! Heav'ns! can my pigs compare, sire, with pigs royal!’ To which the king assented with a nod: On which the brewer bow'd, and said, ‘Good God!’ Then wink'd significant on Miss; Significant of wonder and of bliss— Who, bridling in her chin divine, Cross'd her fair hands, a dear old maid, And then her lowest curtsy made For such high honour done her father's swine. Now did his majesty so gracious say To Mr. Whitbread, in his flying way, ‘Whitbread, d'ye nick th' excisemen now and then? Hæ, Whitbread, when d'ye think to leave off trade? Hæ? what? Miss Whitbread's still a maid, a maid? What, what's the matter with the men? D'ye hunt?—hæ, hunt? No, no, your are too old— You'll be lord may'r—lord may'r one day— Yes, yes, I've heard so—yes, yes, so I'm told: Don't, don't the fine for sheriff pay— I'll prick you ev'ry year, man, I declare: Yes, Whitbread—yes, yes—you shall be lord may'r. Whitbread, d'ye keep a coach, or job one, pray? Job, job, that's cheapest—yes, that's best, that's best— You put your liv'ries on the draymen—hæ? Hæ Whitbread?—You have feather'd well your nest. What, what's the price now, hæ, of all your stock? But, Whitbread, what's o'clock, pray, what's o'clock? Now Whitbread inward said, ‘May I be curst ‘If I know what to answer first;’ Then search'd his brains with ruminating eye— But e'er the man of malt an answer found, Quick on his heel, lo, majesty turn'd round, Skipp'd off, and baulk'd the pleasure of reply. Kings in inquisitiveness should be strong— From curiosity doth wisdom flow: For 'tis a maxim I've adopted long, The more a man inquires, the more he'll know. Reader, didst ever see a water-spout? 'Tis possible that thou wilt answer ‘No.’ Well then! he makes a most infernal rout; Sucks, like an elephant, the waves below, With huge proboscis reaching from the sky, As if he meant to drink the ocean dry: At length so full he can't hold one drop more— He bursts—down rush the waters with a roar On some poor boat, or sloop, or brig, or ship, And almost sinks the wand'rer of the deep: Thus have I seen a monarch at reviews Suck from the tribe of officers the news, Then bear in triumph off each wondrous matter, And souse it on the queen with such a clatter! I always would advise folks to ask questions— For truly, questions are the keys of knowledge: Soldiers—who forage for the mind's digestions— Cut figures at th' Old Bailey, and at college; Make chancellors, chief justices, and judges, E'en of the lowest green-bag drudges. The sages say, Dame Truth delights to dwell, Strange mansion! in the bottom of a well— Questions are then the windlass and the rope That pull the grave old gentlewoman up: Damn jokes then, and unmannerly suggestions, Reflecting upon kings for asking questions This alludes to the late Dr. Johnson's laugh on a great personage, for a laudable curiosity in the queen's library some years since.. Now having well employ'd his royal lungs On nails, hoops, staves, pumps, barrels, and their bungs, The King and Co. sat down to a collation Of flesh, and fish, and fowl of ev'ry nation. Dire was the clang of plates, of knife and fork, That merc'less fell like tomahawks to work, And fearless scalp'd the fowl, the fish, and cattle, Whilst Whitbread, in the rear, beheld the battle. The conqu'ring monarch, stopping to take breath Amidst the regiments of death, Now turn'd to Whitbread with complacence round, And, merry, thus address'd the man of beer— ‘Whitbread, is't true? I hear, I hear You're of an ancient family—renown'd— What? what? I'm told that you're a limb Of Pym His majesty here made a mistake—Pym was his wife's relation., the famous fellow Pym: What, Whitbread, is it true what people say? Son of a round-head are you? hæ? hæ? hæ? I'm told that you send Bibles to your votes— A snuffling round-headed society— Pray'r-books instead of cash to buy them coats— Bunyans, and Practices of Piety: Your Bedford votes would wish to change their fare— Rather see cash—yes, yes—than books of pray'r: Thirtieth of January don't you feed? Yes, yes, you eat calf's head, you eat calf's head.’ Now having wonders done on flesh, fowl, fish, Whole hosts o'erturn'd—and seized on all supplies The royal visitors express'd a wish To turn to House of Buckingham their eyes: But first the monarch, so polite, Ask'd Mr. Whitbread if he'd be a knight. Unwilling in the list to be enroll'd, Whitbread contemplated the knights of Peg, Then to his generous sov'reign made a leg, And said, he was afraid he was too old. He thank'd, however, his most gracious king, For offering to make him such a thing.’ But ah! a diff'rent reason 'twas I fear! It was not age that bade the man of beer The proffer'd honour of the monarch shun: The tale of Marg'ret's knife, and royal fright, Had almost made him damn the name of knight, A tale that farrow'd such a world of fun. He mock'd the pray'r For the miraculous escape from a poor innocent insane woman, who only held out a small knife in a piece of white paper, for her sovereign to view. too by the king appointed Ev'n by himself the Lord's anointed— A foe to fast too, is he, let me tell ye; And, though a Presbyterian, cannot think Heav'n (quarrelling with meat and drink) Joys in the grumble of a hungry belly! Now from the table with Cæsarian air Up rose the monarch with his laurel'd brow, When Mr. Whitbread, waiting on his chair, Express'd much thanks, much joy, and made a bow. Miss Whitbread now so quick her curtsies drops, Thick as her honour'd father's Kentish hops; Which hop-like curtsies were return'd by dips That never-hurt the royal knees and hips; For hips and knees of queens are sacred things, That only bend on gala days Before the best of kings, When odes of triumph sound his praise. Now through a thund'ring peal of kind huzzas, Proceeding some from hir'd When his majesty goes to a playhouse, or brewhouse, or parliament, the lord chamberlain provides some pounds-worth of mob to huzza their beloved monarch. At the playhouse about forty wide-mouthed fellows are hired on the night of their majesties' appearance, at two shillings and sixpence per head, with the liberty of seeing the play gratis. These Stentors are placed in different parts of the theatre, who immediately on the royal entry into the stage box, set up their howl of loyalty; to whom their majesties, with sweetest smiles, acknowledge the obligation by a genteel bow, and an elegant curtsy. This congratulatory noise of the Stentors is looked on by many, particularly country ladies and gentlemen, as an infallible thermometer, that ascertains the warmth of the national regard. and unhir'd jaws, The raree-show thought proper to retire; Whilst Whitbread and his daughter fair Survey'd all Chiswell-street with lofty air, For, lo, they felt themselves some six feet higher! Such, Thomas, is the way to write! Thus shouldst thou birth-day songs indite; Then stick to earth, and leave the lofty sky; No more of ti tum tum, and ti tum ti. Thus should an honest laureat write of kings— Not praise them for imaginary things: I own I cannot make my stubborn rhime Call ev'ry king a character sublime; For conscience will not suffer me to wander So very widely from the paths of candour. I know full well some kings Foreign kings. are to be seen, To whom my verse so bold would give the spleen, Should that bold verse declare they wanted brains; I won't say that they never brain possess'd— They may have been with such a present bless'd, And therefore fancy that some still remains; For ev'ry well-experienc'd surgeon knows That men who with their legs have parted, Swear that they've felt a pain in all their toes, And often at the twinges started: Then star'd upon their oaken stumps in vain! Fancying the toes were all come back again. If men, then, who their absent toes have mourn'd, Can fancy those same toes at times return'd; So kings, in matters of intelligences, May fancy they have stumbled on their senses. Yes, Tom—mine is the way of writing ode— Why liftest thou thy pious eyes to God? Strange disappointment in thy looks I read: And now I hear thee in proud triumph cry, ‘Is this an action, Peter? this a deed To raise a monarch to the sky? Tubs, porter, pumps, vats, all the Whitbread throng, Rare things to figure in the Muse's song!’ Thomas, I here protest I want no quarrels On kings and brewers, porter, pumps, and barrels— Far from the dovelike Peter be such strife! But this I tell thee, Thomas, for a fact— Thy Cæsar never did an act More wise, more glorious in his life. Now God preserve all wonder-hunting kings, Whether at Windsor, Buckingham, or Kew-house; And may they never do more foolish things Than visiting Sam Whitbread and his brewhouse!

'Slife! Thomas, what hath swallow'd all the praise? Of royal virtues not the slightest mention! Strung, like mock pearl, so lately on thy lays! Tell me, a bankrupt, Tom, is thy invention? How couldst thou so thy patron's fame forget, As not to pay of praise, the annual debt? Whitehead and Cibber, all the laureat throng, To Fame's fair temple, twice a year, presented Some royal virtues, real or invented, In all the grave sublimity of song. Heralds so kind for many a chance-born wight, Creeping from cellar, just like snails from earth; Or moles, or field-mice, stealing into light, Forge arms to prove a loftiness of birth; Tracing of each ambitious sir and madam The branches to the very trunk of Adam. Then why not thou, the herald, Tom, of rhime, Still bid thy royal master soar sublime? Bards shine in fiction; then how slight a thing To make a coat of merit for a king! Know, General Carpenter had been a theme For furnishing a pretty lyric dream; Once a monopolist of nod and smile: Of broken sentences and questions rare, Of snipsnap whispers sweet, and grin, and stare, For which thy muse would travel many a mile. But, lo! the general, for a crying sin, Lost broken sentences, and nod, and grin, And stare and snipsnap of the best of kings; The sin, the crying sin, of rambling Where Osnaburgh's good bishop, gambling, Lost some few golden feathers from his wings; Which made th' unlucky general run and drown; Such were the horrors of the royal frown! For, lo! his m?????y most roundly swore He'd nod to General Carpenter no more. Oh! glorious love of all-commanding money! Dear to some monarchs, as to bruin, honey; Dear as to gamblers, pigeons fit to pluck; Or show'rs to hackney coachmen or a duck! Thomas, thy lyrics might have prais'd the king For making sinners mind the Sabbath day, Bidding the idle sons of pipe and string, Instead of scraping jigs, sing psalms and pray; Thus piously (against their inclination) Dragooning souls unto salvation. The monarch gave up Mr. Joah Bate, With that sweet nightingale, his lovely mate; Who with the organ and one fiddle Made up a concert every Sunday night: Thus yielding majesties supreme delight, Who relish cheapness e'en in tweedle tweedle. For nature formeth oft a kind Of money-loving, scraping, save-all mind, That happy glorieth in the nat'ral thought Of getting every thing for nought: From Delhi's diamonds to a Bristol stone; From royal eagles to a squalling parrot; From bulls of Basan to a marrow-bone; From rich ananas to a mawkish carrot: And getting things for nought, I needs must say, If not the noblest, is the cheapest way. And often nature manufactures stuff That thinks it never hath enough; Hoarding up treasure—never once enjoying— Such is the composition of some souls! Like jackdaws all their cunning art employing, In hiding knives, and forks, and spoons, in holes. Lo! by the pious Monarch's proclamation, The courtier amateurs of this fair nation On Sundays con their Bibles—make no riot— The stubborn Uxbridge, music-loving lord, Pays dumb obedience to the royal word, And bids the instruments lie quiet. Sweet Mistress Walsingham is forc'd to pray, And turn her eyes up, much against her will; Sandwich sings psalms too, in his pious way: And Lady Young forbears the tuneful trill: And very politic is Lady Young: A husband must not suffer for a song. The gentle Exeter his treat gave up, So us'd upon the sweet repast to sup; As eager for his Sunday's quaver dish, As cats and rav'nous aldermen for fish. Lord Brudenell, too, a Lord with lofty nose, Bringing to mind a verse the world well knows; Against sublimity that rather wars; Which in an almanack all eyes may see: ‘God gave to man an upright form that he Might view the stars.’ I say this watchful lord, who boasts the knack, Behind his sacred majesty's great back, Of placing for his latter end a chair Better than any lord (so says Fame's trump) That ever waited on the royal rump, So swift his motions, and so sweet his air; Who, if his majesty but cough or hiccup, Trembles for fear the king should kick up; Drops, with concern, his jaw—with horror freezes— Or smiles ‘God bless you, sire,’ whene'er he sneezes; This lord, I say, uprais'd his convert chin, And curs'd the concert for a crying sin. King Watkin, from the land of leeks and cheese, With sighs, forbore his bass to seize; With huge concern he dropp'd his Sunday airs, And grumbled out in Welsh his thankless pray'rs. The bass, indeed, Te Deum sung, Glad on the willows to be hung. And really 'twas a very nat'ral case— Poor, inoffensive bass! For when King Watkin scrubbeth him—alack! The instrument, like one upon the rack, Sends forth such horrid, inquisition groans! Enough to pierce the hearts of stones! Thus though in concert politics the knight Battled with Mistress Walsingham outright; Yet both agreed to lift their palms, Not in hostilities, but singing psalms. Salisbury was also order'd to reform, Who, with my lady, thought it vastly odd, Thus to be forc'd, like sailors in a storm, Against their wills to pray to God. Thus did the royal mandate through the town, Knock nearly all the Sunday concerts down! Great act! ere long 'twill be a sin and shame For cats to warble out an am'rous flame!— Dogs shall be whipp'd for making love on Sunday, Who very well may put it off to Monday. Nay more, the royal piety to prove, And aid the purest of all pure religions, To Bridewell shall be sent all cooing pigeons, And cocks and hens be lash'd for making love: Sparrows and wrens be shot from barns and houses, For being barely civil to their spouses. Poor Sir John Dick was, lamb-like, heard to bleat At losing such a Sunday's treat— Sir John, the happy owner of a star— Which radiant honour on surtouts he stitches; Lamenting fashion doth not stretch so far As sewing them on waistcoats and on breeches; Which thus would pour a blaze of silver day, And make the knight a perfect milky way. Yet Hampden, Cholmond'ly, those sinful shavers, Rebellious, riot in their Sabbath quavers; Thus flying in the face of our great king, Profane God's resting day with wind and string; Whilst on the terrace, 'midst his German band, On Sunday evenings George is pleas'd to stand; Contented with a simple tune alone, ‘God save great George our king,’ or ‘Bobbing Joan;’ Whilst cherubs, leaning from their starry height, Wink at each other, and enjoy the sight: And Satan, from a lurking hole, Fond of a seeming-godly soul, His eyes and ears scarce able to believe, Laughs in his sleeve. Stay, Muse—the mention of the German band Bringeth a tale oppressive to my hand, Relating to a tribe of German boys, Whose horrid fortune made some little noise; Sent for to take of Englishmen the places, Who, gall'd by such hard treatment, made wry faces. Sent for they were, to feed in fields of clover, To feast upon the Coldstream regiment's fat: Swift with their empty stomachs they flew over, And wider than a Kevenhuller hat. But, ah! their knives no veal nor mutton carv'd! To feasts they went indeed, but went and starv'd! Their masters, raptur'd with the tuneful treat, Forgot musicians like themselves cou'd eat. Thus the poor woodcock leaves his frozen shores, When tyrant winter 'midst his tempests roars: Invited by our milder sky, he roves; Views the pure streams with joy, and shelt'ring groves, And in one hour, oh! sad reverse of fate! Is shot, and smokes upon a poacher's plate! Thus ending a sweet episodic strain, I turn, dear Thomas, to thy Ode again. What! make a dish to balk thy master's gums! A pudding, and forget the plums! Mercy upon us! what a cook art thou! Dry e'en already!—what a sad milch cow! Who gav'st, at first, of fame such flowing pails!— Say, Thomas, what thy lyric udder ails? Since truth belongs not to the laureat trade, 'Tis strange, 'tis passing strange, thou didst not flatter: Speak—in light money were thy wages paid? Or was thy pipe of sack half fill'd with water? Or hast thou, Tom, been cheated of thy dues? Or hath a qualm of conscience touch'd thy Muse? Thou might'st have prais'd for dignity of pride, Display'd not long ago among the cooks: Searching the kitchen with sagacious looks; Wigs, christ'ned cratches, on their heads he spied. To find a wig on a cook's head Just like the wig that grac'd his own, Was verily a sight to dread!— Enough to turn a king to stone! On which, in language of his very best, His Majesty his royal ire express'd: ‘How, how! what! cooks wear scratches just like me!— Strange! strange! yes, yes, I see, I see, I see— Fine fellows to wear scratches! yes, no doubt— I'll have no more—no more when mine's worn out— Hæ? pretty! pretty! pretty too it looks To see my scratches upon cooks!’ And, lo! as he had threatened all so big, As soon as ever he wore out the wig, He with a pig-tail deign'd his head to match! Nor more profan'd his temples with a scratch! Thomas, I see my song thy feelings grate— Thou think'st I'm joking; that the king's my hate. The world may call me liar, but sincerely I love him—for a partner, love him dearly; Whilst his great name is on the ferme, I'm sure My credit with the public is secure. Yes, beef shall grace my spit, and ale shall flow, As long as it continues George and Co.; That is to say, in plainer metre, George and Peter. Yet, as some little money I have made, I've thoughts of turning 'squire, and quitting trade: This in my mind I've frequently revolv'd; And in six months, or so, For all I know, The partnership may be dissolv'd. Whate'er thou think'st—howe'er the world may carp, Thomas, I'm far from hating our good king; Yes, yes, or may I thrum no more my harp, As David swore, who touch'd so well the string— No! Tom;—the idol of thy sweet devotion Excites not hate, whatever else th' emotion. To write a book on the sublime, I own, Were I a bookseller, I would not hire him: Yet, should I hate the man who fills a throne, Because, forsooth, I can't admire him? Hate him, because, ambitious of a name, He thinks to rival e'en the prince in fame? A prince of science—in the arts so chaste!— A giant to him in the world of taste; Who from an envious cloud one day shall spring, And prove that dignity may clothe a king. Who when by fortune fix'd on Britain's throne, Wherever merit, humble plant, is shown, Will shed around that plant a fost'ring ray; Whose hand shall stretch through poverty's pale gloom For drooping genius, sinking to the tomb, And lead the blushing stranger into day. Who scorns (like some) to chronicle a shilling, Once in a twelvemonth to a beggar giv'n; By such mean charity (Lord help 'em) willing To go as cheap as possible to Heav'n! Hate him, because, untir'd, the monarch pores On Handel's manuscript old scores, And schemes successful daily hatches, For saving notes o'erwhelm'd with scratches; Recovering from the blotted leaves Huge cart-horse minims, dromedary breves; Thus saving damned bars from just damnation, By way of bright'ning Handel's reputation; Who, charm'd with ev'ry crotchet Handel wrote, Heav'd into Tot'nam Street each heavy note; And forcing on the house the tuneless lumber, Drove half to doors, the other half to slumber? Hate him, because the works of Mr. West, His eye (in wonder lost) unsated views? Because his walls, with tasteless trumpery drest, Robs a poor sign-post of its dues? Hate him, because he cannot rest, But in the company of West? Because of modern works he makes a jest, Except the works of Mr. West? Who by the public, fain would have carest The works alone of Mr. West! Who thinks, of painting, truth, and taste, the test, None but the wondrous works of Mr. West! Who, as for Reynolds, cannot bear him; And never suffers Wilson's landscapes near him. Nor, Gainsb'rough, thy delightful girls and boys, In rural scenes so sweet, amidst their joys, With such simplicity as makes us start, Forgetting 'tis the work of art. Which wonder and which care of Mr. West May in a simile be well exprest:— A SIMILE. Thus have I seen a child, with smiling face, A little daisy in the garden place, And strut in triumph round its fav'rite flow'r; Gaze on the leaves with infant admiration, Thinking the flow'r the finest in the nation, Then pay a visit to it ev'ry hour: Lugging the wat'ring pot about, Which John the gard'ner was oblig'd to fill; The child, so pleas'd, would pour the water out, To show its marvellous gard'ning skill; Then staring round, all wild for praises panting, Tell all the world it was its own sweet planting; And boast away, too happy elf, How that it found the daisy all itself! ANOTHER SIMILE. In simile if I may shine agen,— Thus have I seen a fond old hen With one poor miserable chick; Bustling about a farmer's yard; Now on the dunghill labouring hard, Scraping away through thin and thick: Flutt'ring her feathers—making such a noise! Cackling aloud such quantities of joys, As if this chick, to which her egg gave birth, Was born to deal prodigious knocks, To shine the Broughton of game cocks, And kill the fowls of all the earth! E'en with his painter let the king be blest; Egad! eat, drink, and sleep with Mr. West; Only let me, excus'd from such a guest, Not eat, and drink, and sleep with Mr. West; And as he will not please my taste—no never— Let me not give him to the world as clever— A better conscience in my bosom lies, Than imitate the fellow and his flies. THE TOPER AND THE FLIES. A group of topers at a table sat, With punch that much regales the thirsty soul: Flies soon the party join'd, and join'd the chat, Humming, and pltching round the mantling bowl, At length those flies got drunk, and for their sin, Some hundreds lost their legs, and tumbled in; And sprawling 'midst the gulf profound, Like Pharaoh and his daring host were drown'd! Wanting to drink—one of the men Dipp'd from the bowl the drunken host, And drank—then taking care that none were lost, He put in ev'ry mother's son agen, Up jump'd the Bacchanalian crew on this, Taking it very much amiss— Swearing, and in the attitude to smite:— ‘Lord!’ cried the man, with gravely-lifted eyes, ‘Though I don't like to swallow flies, I did not know but others might!’ Who says I hate the king proclaims a lie! E'en now a royal virtue strikes my eye! To prove th' assertion, let me just relate The king's submission to the will of Fate. Whene'er in hunts the monarch is thrown out, As in his politics—a common thing! With searching eyes he stares at first about, Then faces the misfortune like a king! Hearing no news of nimble Mr. Stag, He sits like patience grinning on his nag! Now, wisdom-fraught, his curious eyeballs ken The little hovels that around him rise: To these he trots—of hogs surveys the sties, And nicely numbers ev'ry cock and hen. Then asks the farmer's wife or farmer's maid, How many eggs the fowls have laid! What's in the oven—in the pot—the crock Whether 'twill rain or no, and what's o'clock?— Thus from poor hovels gleaning information, To serve as future treasure for the nation! There, terrier-like, till pages find him out, He pokes his most sagacious nose about, And seems in Paradise—like that so fam'd; Looking like Adam too, and Eve so fair: Sweet simpletons! who, though so very bare, ‘Were,’ says the Bible, ‘not asham'd.’ No man binds books so well as George the Third, By thirst of leather glory spurr'd— At bookbinders he oft is seen to laugh— And wondrous is the king in sheep or calf! But see! the Prince upon such labour looks Fastidious down, and only readeth books!— Here by the sire the son is much surpass'd; Which Fame should publish on her loudest blast! The king beats Monmouth Street in cast-off-riches— That is, in coats, and waistcoats, and in breeches— Which, draughted once a year for foreign stations, Make fine recruits to serve some near relations. But lo! the Prince, shame on him! never dreams, Of pretty Jewish œconomic schemes! So very proud (I'm griev'd, O Tom, to tell it), He'd rather give a coat away than sell it! Fair justice to the monarch must allow Prodigious science in a calf or cow; And wisdom in the article of swine! What most unusual knowledge for a king! Because pig-wisdom is a thing In which no sov'reigns e'er were known to shine. Yet who will think I am not telling fibs? The Prince, who Britain's throne in time shall grace, Ne'er finger'd at a fair a bullock's ribs, Nor ever ogled a pig's face! O dire disgrace! O let it not be known That thus a father hath excell'd a son! Truth bids me own that I can bring A dozen who admire the king; And should he dream of setting off for Hanover, As once he said he wou'd to spite Charles Fox; Draw all his little money from the stocks, Shut shop, and carry ev'ry pot and pan over; I think—indeed I'm sure I know, That dozen would not let him go; But in the struggle spend their vital breath, And hug their idol, probably to death; As happen'd to a Romish priest—a tale That, whilst I tell it, almost turns me pale. THE ROMISH PRIEST. A TALE. A Parson in the neighbourhood of Rome, Some years ago—how many, I don't say— Handled so well his heav'nly broom, He brush'd, like cobwebs, sins away. Brighten'd the black horizon of his parish; Gave to the Prince of Darkness such hard blows, That Satan was afraid to show his nose (Except in Hell) before this priest so warrish! To teach folks how to shun the paths of evil, And prove a match for Mr. Devil, Was constantly this pious man's endeavour, And, as I've said before, the man was clever. Red-hot was all his zeal—and Fame declares, He gallop'd like a hunter o'er his pray'rs; For ever lifting to the clouds his forehead— Petitions on petitions he let fly, Which nothing but Barbarians could deny— In short, the saints were to compliance worried. With shoulders, arms, and hands, this priest devout, So well his evolutions did perform; His pray'rs, those holy small-shot, flew about So thick!—it seem'd like taking Heav'n by storm! Without one atom of reflection, No candidate at an election Did ever labour more, and fume, and sweat, To make a fellow change his coat, And bless him with the casting vote, Than this dear man to get in Heav'n a seat For souls of children, women, and of men: No matter which the species—cock or hen! Thus did he not, like that vile Jesuit, think, Who makes us all with horror shrink, A knave high meriting Hell's hottest coals; Who wrote a dreadful book to prove That women, charming women, form'd for love, Have got no souls! Monster! to think that woman had no soul! Ha! hast thou not a soul, thou peerless maid, Who bidst my rural hours with rapture roll? Whose beauties charm the shepherds and the shade! Yes, Cynthia, and for souls like thine, Fate into being drew yon starry sphere; Then kindly sent thy form divine, To show what wondrous bliss inhabits there! In short, no dray-horse ever work'd so hard, From vaults to drag up hogshead, tun or pipe, As this good priest, to drag, for small reward, The souls of sinners from the Devil's gripe. Pleas'd were the highest angels to express Their wonder at his fine address; And pow'r against the fiend who makes such strife; Nay, e'en St. Peter said, to whom are giv'n The keys for letting people into Heav'n, He never got more halfpence in his life. 'Twas added that my namesake did declare (Peter, the porter of Heav'n gate, so trusty), That till this priest appear'd, souls were so rare His bunch of keys was absolutely rusty! Did gentlemen of fortune die, And leave the church a good round sum; Lo! in the twinkling of an eye, The parson frank'd their souls to kingdom-come! A letter to the porter, or a word, Insur'd admittance to the Lord. Nor stopp'd those souls an instant on the road To take a roast before they enter'd in: For had they got the plague, 'twas said that God Had let them enter without quarantine. Well then! this parson was so much admir'd, So sought, so courted, so desir'd, Thousands with putrid souls, like putrid meat, Came for his holy pickle, to be sweet: Just as we see old hags with jaws of carrion, Enter the shop of Mr. Warren; Who disappoints that highwayman call'd Time (Noted for robbing ladies of their prime), By giving sixty-five's pale, wither'd mien, The blooming roses of sixteen. Such vast impressions did his sermons make, He always kept his flock awake— In summer too,—hear, parsons, this strange news, Ye who so often preach to nodding pews! A neighb'ring town, into whose people's souls Sin, like a rat, had eat large holes, Begg'd him to be their tinker—their hole-stopper— For, gentle reader, sin of such a sort is, It souls corrodeth just as aqua fortis Corrodeth iron, brass, or copper. They told him they would give him better pay, If he'd agree to change his quarters; Protesting, when his soul should leave its clay, To rank his bones with those of saints and martyrs. This was a handsome bribe all papists know! But stop—his parish would not let him go— Then surly did the other parish look, And swore to have the man by hook or crook. So seiz'd him, like a graceless throng— The priest's parishioners, who lov'd him well, Rather than to another church belong, Swore they would sooner see him lodg'd in Hell— So violent was their objection! So very strong, too, their affection! The ladies, too, united in the strife; Protesting that they ‘lov'd him as their life,’ So sweetly he would look when down to pray'r! So happy in a sermon choice; And then he had of nightingales the voice— And holy water gave with such an air! Lord! lose so fine a man!—so great a treasure! Yielding such quantities of heav'nly pleasure! Forgiving sins so free, too, at confession, However carnal the transgression, In such a charming, love-condemning strain! He really seem'd to say, “Go sin again; Hell shall not throw, my angels, on your souls So sweet, a single shovelful of coals.” Now in the fire was all the fat: Just as two bull-dogs pull a cat, Both parishes with furious zeal contended— So heartily the holy man was hugg'd, So much from place to place his limbs were lugg'd, That very fatally the battle ended! In short, by hugging, lugging, and kind squeezes, The man of God was pull'd in fifty pieces! This work perform'd, the bones were fought for stoutly; And so the fray continued most devoutly— Lo with an arm away one rascal fled; This with a leg, and that the head— Off with the foot another goes— Another seizes him and gets the toes. Nay, some, a relic so intent to crib, Fought just like mastiffs for a rib; Nay more (for truth, to tell the whole, obliges), A dozen battled for his os coccygis The tip of the rump.! Heav'n, that sees all things, saw the dire dispute, In which each parish acted like a brute; Then bade the dead man as a saint be sought Still, to reward him more, his bones enriches With pow'r o'er evils, rheumatisms, and itches, However dreadful, and wherever caught: Thus, by the grace of Him who governs thunder, His very toe nail could perform a wonder. Thus might our monarch, by this dozen men, Be hugg'd!—and then! and then! and then! and then! Then what? why then, this direful ill must spring: I a good subject lose, and thou a king! No, Tom; no more to strike us with amaze, Thy courtly tropes of adulation blaze: A setting sun art thou, so mild thy beam! Thou (like old Ocean's heaving wave no more, That lifts a ship and fly with equal roar) Pour'st from thy lyric pipe a sober stream. No more we hear the gale of Fame Wild blust'ring with thy master's name; No more ideal virtues ride sublime (Like feathers), on the surge of rhime. But lo the cause! it was the royal will To bid the tempest of his praise be still: No more to let his virtues make a rout, Blown by thy blasts like paper kites about— Indeed thy sov'reign in thy verse so fine, Might justly have exclaim'd at many a line, ‘In peacock's feathers, lo, this knave arrays me.’ And like a king of France of whom I've read, Our gracious sov'reign also might have said, ‘What have I done that he should praise me.’ With pity have I seen thee, song of song, Trundling thy lyric wheelbarrow along, Amid'st St. James's gapers to unload The motley mass of pompous ode; And wish'd the sack, for verse the annual prize, To poets of a less renown— To poor Will Mason, who in secret sighs To strut beneath the laureat's leaden crown. Warm in the praise thou might'st have been, Of thy great king and his great queen; But not so diabolically hot— A downright devil or a pepper-pot. By dev'l (without thy being born a wizard) Thou ought'st to know I mean a turkey's gizzard; So christen'd for its quality, by man, Because so oft 'tis loaded with kian— This dev'l is such a red-hot bit of meat As nothing but the dev'l himself should eat. A spoon was large enough, the world well knows! Why give the pap of praise then with a ladle? Gently thou should'st have rock'd him to repose— Not like a drunken nurse o'erturn'd the cradle. I do not marvel that the king was wrath (Knowing himself no bigger than a lath) To find himself a tall, gigantic oak— 'Twas too much of a magic-lantern stroke. Ah! where was Modesty, the charming maid? Where was the rural vagrant straying, Not to admonish thee, an idle jade, When thou thy tuneful compliments wert paying? Yet why this question put I, Tom, to thee? Lord! how we wits forget—she was with me. Dear Modesty (by very few carest) Oft condescends to be my guest: From time to time the maid my rhime reviews, And dictates sweet instructions to the muse. Yes, frequent deigns my cottage to adorn, Just like that blushful damsel call'd Miss Morn— Who smiling from the dreary caves of night, Moves from her east with silent pace and slow O'er yonder shadowy mount's gigantic brow, And to my window steals with dewy light, Then peeping through the panes with cherub mien, Seems to ask liberty to enter in. Now vent'ring on the sables of my room, She sweeps the darkness with her star-clad broom: Now pleas'd a stronger splendour to diffuse, Smiles on the plated buckles in my shoes; Smiles on my breeches, too, of handsome plush, Where George's head once made no gingling sound, But where amidst the pockets all was hush; Such awful silence reign'd around! Whose fob, which thieves so often pick, Was quite a stranger to a watch's click. Now casting on my pen and ink a ray, Seeming with sweet reproof to say, ‘The lark to Heav'n her grateful matins sings: Then, Peter, also ope thy tuneful throat, And, happy in a fascinating note, Rise and bewitch the best of kings.’ Howe'er the world t'abuse me may be giv'n, I cannot do without crown'd heads, by Heav'n! Bards must have subjects that their genius suit,— And if I've not crown'd heads I must be mute. My verse is somewhat like a game at whist; Which game, though play'd by people e'er so keen, Cannot with much success, alas! exist, Except their hands possess a king and queen. I own, my muse delights in royal folk: Lead-mines, producing many pretty pounds! Joe Millars, furnishing a fund of joke! Lo, with a fund of joke a court abounds! At royal follies, Lord! a lucky hit Saves our poor brain th' expense of wit: At princes let but satire lift his gun, The more their feathers fly, the more the fun. E'en the whole world, blockheads and men of letters, Enjoy a cannonade upon their betters. And, vicé versâ, kings and queens Know pretty well what scandal means, And love it too—yes, majesty's a grinner: Scandal that really would disgrace a stable Hath oft been beckon'd to a royal table, And pleas'd a princely palate more than dinner. I know the world exclaimeth in this guise:— ‘Suppose a king not over wise (A vice in kings not very oft suspected), Suppose he does this childish thing, and this, If folly constitutes a monarch's bliss, Shall such by saucy poets stand corrected? ‘Bold is the man,’ old parson Calchas Vide Homer. cries, ‘Who tells a monarch where his error lies.’— ‘Grant that a king in converse cannot shine, And sharp with shrewd remark a world alarm; What business, Peter Pindar, is 't of thine? Grant puerilities—pray where's the harm?— To this I answer, ‘I don't think a king Will go to hell for ev'ry childish thing— Yet mind, I think that one in his great station Should show sublime example to a nation: And when an eagle he should spring To drink the solar blaze on tow'ring wing; With daring and undazzled eyes; Not be a sparrow upon chimneys hopping, His head in holes and corners popping For flies.’ Tom, I'm not griev'd that thou hast chang'd thy note, And op'd on Windsor wall thy tuneful throat; For verily it is a rare old mass! Nor angry that to West thou dost descend; The king's great painting oracle and friend, Who teacheth Jervas how to spoil good glass. But, son of Isis, since amidst this ode, Thou talk'st of painting, like an ardent lover, Of panes of glass now daubing over, Dimming delightfully the great abode; Speak—know'st thou aught of Raphael's rare cartoons? I have not seen them, Tom, for many moons! Why didst thou not, amidst thy rhiming fit, Of those most heav'nly pictures talk a bit— For which the nation paid down ev'ry souse? Rare pictures, brought long since from Hampton Court, And by a self-taught carpenter cut short, To suit the pannels of the queen's old house. So says report—I hope it is not true— And yet I verily believe it too; It is so like some people I could name, Whose pericraniums walk a little lame. Beshrew me, but it brings to mind A cutting story, much of the same kind! It happ'd at Plymouth town so fair and sweet, Where wandering gutlers, wandering gutlers meet, Making in show'rs of rain a monstrous pother; Bart'ring, like Rag-fair Jews, with one the other, With carrots, cabbage leaves, and breathless cats, Potatoes, turnip tops, old rags, and hats: A town that brings to mind Swift's city show'r— Where clouds to wash its face for ever pour— A town where beau-traps under water grin, Inviting gentle strangers to walk in; Where dwell the lady Naiads of the flood, Prepar'd to crown their visitors with mud. A town where parsons for the living fight, On every vacancy, with godly might, Like wrestlers for lac'd hats and buckskin breeches; Where oft the priest who best his lungs employs To make the rarest diabolic noise, With surest chance of vict'ry preaches: Whose empty sounds alone his labours bless; Like cannon fir'd by vessels in distress. A town where, exil'd by the higher pow'rs, The royal tar with indignation lours; Kept by his sire from London, and from sin, To say his catechism to Mrs. Wynn. THE PLYMOUTH CARPENTER AND THE COFFINS. In the last war French pris'ners often died Of fevers, colds, and more good things beside: Presents for valour, from damp walls and chinks, And nakedness, that seldom sees a shirt; And vermin, and all sorts of dirt; And multitudes of motley stinks, That might with smells of any clime compare That ever sought the nose or fields of air. As coffins are deem'd necessary things, Forming a pretty sort of wooden wings For wafting men, to graves, for t'other world; Where anchor'd (doom'd to make no voyages more), The rudders of our souls are put ashore, And all the sails for ever furl'd. A carpenter, first cousin to the may'r, Hight master Screw, a man of reputation, Got leave, through borough int'rest, to prepare Good wooden lodgings for the Gallic nation: I mean for luckless Frenchmen that were dead; And very well indeed Screw's contract sped. His good friend Death made wonderful demands, As if they play'd into each other's hands; As if the carpenter and Death went snacks— Wishing to make as much as e'er they cou'd By this same contract coffin wood, For such as Death had thrown upon their backs. This carpenter, like men of other trades Whom conscience very easily persuades To take from neighbours useless superfluity; Resolv'd upon an œconomic plan, Which shows that in the character of man Economy is not an incongruity. I know some monarchs say the same—whose pulses. Beat high for iv'ry chairs and beds and bulses. For lo, this man of œconomic sort Made all his coffins much too short, Yet snugly he accommodates the dead— Cuts off, with much sang froid, the head, And then to keep it safe as well as warm, He gravely puts it underneath the arm; Making his dead man quite a Paris beau!— Hugging his jowl en chapeau bras. But, Thomas, now to those cartoons of fame— Do ask thy sov'reign in my name What's to be done with those rare pictures next; Some months ago, by night, they travell'd down To the Queen's House in Windsor town, At which the London folks were vastly vex'd. For if those fine cartoons, as hist'ry says, Were (much to this great nation's praise) Bought for the nation's sole inspection; Unask'd, to suffer any man to feel 'em, Or suffer any forward dame to steal 'em, Would be a national reflection. Tom, ask, to Strelitz if they're doom'd to go, Because the walls are naked there I know— Strelitz a mouse-hole is, all dark and drear; And shou'd the pictures be inclin'd to stray, Not liking Strelitz, they may lose their way, And ramble to some Hebrew auctioneer: Where, like poor captur'd negroes in a knot, The holy wand'rers may be made a lot— And, like the goods at Garraway's we handle, Christ and the saints be sold by inch of candle! Dearly beloved Thomas, to conclude! (I see thee ready to bawl out ‘amen:’) Joking apart, don't think me rude For wishing to instruct thy lyric pen Whether like trout and eels in humble pride, Along the simple stream of prose we glide; Or stirring from below a cloud of mud, Like whales we flounder through the lyric flood; Or if a past'ral image charm thee more; Whether the vales of prose our feet explore, Or rais'd sublime on Ode's aërial steep, We bound from rock to rock like goats and sheep; Whether we dine with dukes on fifty dishes, Or, poet-like, against our wishes, On beef or pork, an œconomic crumb (Perchance no bigger than our thumb, Turn'd by a bit of packthread at the fire), To satisfy our hunger's keen desire; A good old proverb let us keep in view— Viz. Thomas, ‘Give the dev'l his due.’ Whether a monarch, issuing high command, Smiles us to court, and shakes us by the hand; Or rude bumbailiffs touch us on the shoulder, And bid our tuneful harps in prison moulder; Sell not (to meanness sunk) one golden line— The Muse's incense for a gill of wine. This were a poor excuse of thine, my friend— ‘Few are the people that my ode attend: I'm like a country clock, poor, lonely thing, That on the staircase, or behind the door, Cries “Cuckow, cuckow,” just at twelve and four, And chimes that vulgar tune, “God save the king.” Oh! if deserting Windsor's lofty tow'rs, To save a sixpence in his barrack bow'rs, A monarch shuffles from the world away, And gives to Folly's whims the bustling day; From such low themes thy promis'd praise recall, And sing more wonders of the old mud wall. PETER's PENSION, A SOLEMN EPISTLE TO A SUBLIME PERSONAGE. ‘My heart is inditing of a good matter—I speak of the things which I have made, unto the king. PSALM LXV. Non possum tecum vivere, nec sine te.’ THE ARGUMENT. A grand Exordium, containing news from Jericho— Peter informeth Majesty of the great Noise on their respective Accounts—and talketh of Samson and Dalilah—the London Coffee houses and the Royal Exchange—Peter explaineth the Cause of the great Noise, and ejaculateth—talketh of Preparations at the Palace for his Disgrace and Murder—Peter informeth Majesty of what Majesty hath been informed—complaineth that he hath been pictured a downright Devil—beggeth that a proper Inquiry may be instituted—Peter pronounceth himself no Devil—Peter writeth soft Sonnets, to prove that he hath not a hard Heart. Peter talketh of Courtiers and Court Matters—of what the World wickedly sayeth of him—Peter cannot convince the World—mentioneth the Despondence of the Newspapers, Magazines, and Reviews—also the Famine in Poetry—Peter exculpateth Majesty—Peter refuseth modestly—hinteth at royal Misfortunes, Diamonds, Nabobs, and an Action of Trover—Peter prophesieth mournfully—giveth the History of Nebuchadnezzar's Grass Diet—Peter affordeth good Reasons for refusing a Pension—relateth an Anecdote of a dead Archbishop—formeth a Scheme for universal Happiness, by discovering Sin and Shame to be a Pair of Impostors, and for making mournful Sunday merry—Peter out-doeth old Poets in Egotism—condemneth Mistress Damer, the great she-statuary, for attempting our most sublime Sovereign—Peter, like many Authors, exhibiteth prodigious Acquaintance with ancient Literature, by mentioning the Names of Jupiter, Phidias, Praxiteles, Virgil, and Augustus Cæsar—Peter puffeth again—Peter produceth a Tale about Majesty, Mister Robinson, Alderman Skinner, and choked Sheep—also a Tale of Majesty and Parson Young, whose Neck was unfortunately unhinged at a Hunt. Peter still hankereth after Pensions—declaimeth on the Powers of Poetry, as also on his own miraculous Powers—Peter professeth Independency, and great Capability of making a hearty Mutton-bone Dinner, like Andrew Marvel—Peter distrusteth his Fortitude—quoteth Opposition-Men for pitiful desertion of Principle, and descanteth on Money—Peter telleth an apposite Tale of Lady Huntingdon's Parson, a Dog, and a Squire. Peter quoteth the Wind and Mr. Eden—exhibiteth more Symptoms of Pension-love—concludeth in a Foam against Knighthood. Dread sir, the rams' horns that blew down The walls of Jericho's old town, Made a most monstrous uproar, all agree— But lo! a louder noise around us rages, About two most important personages, No less, my royal liege, than you and me! In short, not greater the Philistines made When Dalilah, a little artful jade (Indeed a very pretty girl), Snipp'd off her lover Mister Samson's curl, Who well repaid the clamours of the bears, By pulling down the house about their ears. Prodigious is the shake around! Still London keeps (thank God) her ground Yet, how th' exchange and coffee-houses ring! Nothing is heard but Peter and the King: The handsome bar-maids stare, as mute as fishes; And sallow waiters, fright'ned, drop their dishes! At first 'twas thought the triumph of the Jews On some great vict'ry in the boxing way: The news, the very anti-christian news, Of Israel's Hero Mendoza. having won the day; And Humphries, a true christian boxer, beat: Enough to give all Christendom a sweat. Again, 'twas thought great news of the grand Turk Who on his hands hath got some serious work; 'Twas fancied he had lost the day; That ev'ry mussulman was kill'd in battle, A fate most proper for such heathen cattle, Who do not pray to God our way. But lo! unto the lofty skies, Of sound this wonderful ascension, Doth verily, my liege, from this arise; That you have giv'n the gentle bard a pension! Great is the shout indeed, sir, all abroad, That you have order'd me this handsome thing; On which, with lifted eyes, I've said, ‘Good God! Though great my merits, yet how great the king!’ And yet, believe me, sir, I lately heard, That all your doors were doubly lock'd and barr'd Against the poet for his tuneful art; And that the tall, stiff, stately, red machines, Your grenadiers, the guards of kings and queens, Were order'd all to stab me to the heart: That if to house of Buckingham I came, Commands were giv'n to Mistress Brigg, A comely, stout, two-handed dame, To box my ears and pull my wig, The cooks to spit me—curry me, the grooms, And kitchen queens to baste me with their brooms. You're told that in my ways I'm very evil! So ugly; fit to travel for a show, And that I look all grimly where I go! Just like a devil! With horns, and tail, and hoofs that make folks start; And in my breast a millstone for a heart! This cometh from a certain painter The great Mr. West., sire, Bid story-mousing Nicolay inquire: Your page, your mercury, with cunning eyes; Who, jumping at each sound, so eager, opes His pretty wither'd pair of Chinese chops, Like a Dutch dog that leaps at butterflies. He, sire, will look me o'er, and will not fail To swear that I've no horns, nor hoofs, nor tail. Lord! Lord! these sayings grieve me and surprise! Dread sir, don't see with other people's eyes— No dev'l am I with horns, and tail, and hoofs— As for the likeness of my heart to stone— No, sir—it's full as tender as your own— Accept, my liege, some simple love-sick proofs. TO AN UNFORTUNATE BEAUTY. Say, lovely maid with downcast eye, And cheek with silent sorrow pale; What gives thy heart the lengthen'd sigh, That heaving tells a mournful tale? Thy tears which thus each other chase, Bespeak a breast o'erwhelm'd with woe; Thy sighs, a storm that wrecks thy peace, Which souls like thine should never know. Oh! tell me doth some favour'd youth, Too often blest, thy beauties slight? And leave those thrones of love and truth, That lip, and bosom of delight? What though to other nymphs he flies, And feigns the fond impassion'd tear, Breathes all the eloquence of sighs, That treach'rous won thy artless ear? Let not those nymphs thy anguish move, For whom his heart may seem to pine— That heart shall ne'er be blest by love, Whose guilt can force a pang from thine. FOR CYNTHIA. Ah! tell me no more, my dear girl, with a sigh, That a coldness will creep o'er my heart; That a sullen indiff'rence will dwell on my eye, When thy beauty begins to depart. Shall thy graces, O Cynthia, that gladden my day, And brighten the gloom of the night, Till life be extinguish'd, from memory stray, Which it ought to review with delight? Upbraiding, shall gratitude say with a tear, ‘That no longer I think of those charms Which gave to my bosom such rapture sincere, And faded at length in my arms?’ Why yes! it may happen, thou damsel divine:— To be honest—I freely declare, That e'en now to thy converse so much I incline, I've already forgot thou art fair. TO LAURA. How happy was the morn of love, When first thy beauty won my heart! How guiltless of a wish to rove! I deem'd it more than death to part! Whene'er from thee I chanc'd to stray, How fancy dwelt upon thy mien, That spread with flow'rs my distant way, And show'r'd delight on every scene! But Fortune, envious of my joys, Hath robb'd a lover of thy charms— From me thy sweetest smile decoys, And gives thee to another's arms. Yet, though my tears are doom'd to flow, May tears be never Laura's lot! Let love protect thy heart from woe; His wound to mine shall be forgot. HYMN TO MODESTY. O Modesty! thou shy and blushful maid, Don't of a simple shepherd be afraid; Wert thou my lamb—with sweetest grass I'd treat thee— I am no wolf so savage that should eat thee: Then haste with me, O nymph, to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Thy fragrant breast, like Alpine snows so white, Where all the nestling loves delight to lie; Thine eyes, that shed the milder light Of night's pale wand'rer o'er her cloudless sky, O nymph, my panting, wishing bosom warm, And beam around me, what a world of charm! Then haste with me, O nymph, to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Thy flaxen ringlets, that luxuriant spread, And hide thy bosom with an envious shade; Thy polish'd cheek so dimpled, where the rose In all the bloom of ripening summer blows; Thy luscious lips, that heav'nly dreams inspire, By beauty formed and loaded with desire; With sorrow and with wonder, lo! I see (What melting treasures!) thrown away on thee. Then haste with me, O nymph to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Thou knowest not that bosom's fair design; And as for those two pouting lips divine, Thou think'st them form'd alone for simple chat— To bill so happy with thy fav'rite dove, And playful force, with sweetly fondling love, Their kisses on a lapdog or a cat. Then haste with me, meek maid, to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Such thoughts thy sweet simplicity produces! But I can point out far sublimer uses; Uses the very best of men esteem— Of which thine innocence did never dream: Then haste with me, meek maid to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Oh! fly from impudence, the brazen rogue, Whose flippant tongue hath got the Irish brogue, Whose hands would pluck thee like the fairest flow'r, Thy cheeks, eyes, forehead, lips, and neck, devour: Shun, shun, that Caliban, and with me dwell: Then come, and give a goddess to my cell. The world, O simple maid, is full of art, Would turn thee pale, and fill with dread thy heart, Didst thou perceive but half the snares The dev'l for charms like thine prepares! Then haste, O nymph, with me to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. From morn to eve my kiss of speechless love, Thy eyes' mild beam and blushes shall improve; And, lo! from our so innocent embrace, Young modesties shall spring, a numerous race! The blushing girls in ev'ry thing like thee, The bashful boys prodigiously like me! Then haste with me, O nymph, to dwell, And give a goddess to my cell. Is not this pretty, sir? can aught be sweeter? Instead of that vile appellation, devil, So blackguard, so unfriendly, and uncivil, Should not I be baptiz'd the gentle Peter? Great is the buz about the court, As at th' Exchange, where Jews, Turks, Christians meet, Or Smithfield fair, where beasts of ev'ry sort, Pigs, sheep, men, bullocks, all so friendly greet. Busy indeed is many a sly court leech; Afraid to trust each other with a speech— In hems, and hahs, and half words, hinting: Some whisp'ring, list'ning, tip-toe walking, squinting For lo, so warily each courtier speaks, They seem to talk with halters round their necks. Some praise the king for nobleness of spirit, For ever studying how to find out merit; Whilst from its box their heart doth slily peep, And ask the tongue with marv'ling eyes, How it can dare to tell a heap Of such unconscionable, bare-fac'd lies? ‘How are the mighty fall'n!’ the people cry— Meaning me— ‘Another hog of Epicurus' stye; This vile apostate bends to Baal the knee; Lo, for a little meat and guzzle, This sneaking cur, too, takes the muzzle. In lyric scandal soon will be a chasm— He wrote for bribes, 'tis plain, and now he has 'em. This mighty war-horse will be soon in hand, By means of meat, the price of venal notes, Calm as a hackney coach-horse on his stand, Tossing about his nose-bag and his oats. Whatever he hath said he dares unsay, In native impudence so rich— Explain the plainest things away, And call his muse a forward b?????; Treat fire of friendly promises as smoke, And laugh at truth and honour as a joke.’ Such, sir, is your good people's howl, As thick as small birds pestering a poor owl. In vain I tell the world around, That I have not a pension found; Which speech of simple truth the mob enrages; ‘Peter this is an arrant lie— The fact is clear, too clear,’ they cry— ‘Thou hast already touch'd a quarter's wages. Varlet, it always was thy vile intention— Thou hast, thou hast, thou liar! got a pension.’ Still, to support my innocence, I've said, Most sinfully, I own—‘I han't, by G???:’ Yet, had I sworn my eyes out of my head, They never had believ'd—How vastly odd! The morning and the evening papers, Struck by the sound, are in the vapours, And mourn and droop, to think I'm dead— Stunn'd by the unexpected news, The Magazines and the Reviews For grief can scarcely lift the head. ‘Nothing but poor mechanic stuff,’ they cry, ‘Shall now be quoted for the public eye; Nothing original in song— No novelty of images and thought Before our fair Tribunal shall be brought! But trifling transpositions of our tongue: Nought but a solemn pomp of words, Bearing a lifeless thought, shall readers meet— The picture of a funeral that affords; So solemn marching through the staring street; Where flags, and horse, and foot, a sorrow ape, With all the dread dismality of crape, Near the poor corpse—perhaps a puny brat, Or dry old maid, as meagre as a cat.’ No, sir! you never offered me a pension; But then I guess it is your kind intention— Yes, sir, you mean a small douceur to proffer; But give me leave, sir, to decline the offer. I'm much oblig'd t'ye, sir, for your good will; But oratorios His Majesty's baby oratorios in Tottenhamstreet, after a great struggle to live, are absolutely dead. Poor souls! they died of a famine—Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden oratorios eat away their meat. have half undone ye: 'Tis whisper'd, too, that thieves have robb'd the till Which kept your milk and butter money. So much with saving wisdom are you taken, Drury and Covent-Garden seem forsaken— Since cost attendeth those theatric borders, Content you go to Richmond House Here is a pretty little nutshell of a theatre, fitted up for the convenience of ladies and gentlemen of quality who wish to expose themselves. with orders. Form'd to delight all eyes, all hearts engage, When lately the sweet Princess Princess Royal. came of age, Train oil instead of wax was bid t'illume The goodly company and dancing-room! This never had been done, I'm very sure, Had not you been, some way or other, poor. You now want guineas to buy live stock, sir, To graze your Windsor hill and vale; And farmers will not let their cattle stir, Until the money's down upon the nail. I'm told your sheep have dy'd by dogs and bitches, And that your fowls have suffer'd by the fitchews; And that your man-traps, guards of goose and duck, And cocks and hens, have had but so-so luck. Scarce fifty rogues, in chase of fowls and eggs, Have in those loving engines left their legs. The bulse, sir, on a visit to the Tow'r, Howe'er the royal visage may look sour, Howe'er an object of a deep devotion, Must cross once more the Eastern Ocean! Indeed I hope the di'monds will be off, Or scandal on us rolls in floods— Some Nabob may be vile enough To bring an action for stol'n goods— An action, to speak lawyer-like, of trover; And Heav'n forbid it should come over! For money matters, I am sure, The Abbey music was put off; Because the royal purse is poor, Plagu'd with a dry consumptive cough; Yet in full health again that purse may riot, By God's grace, and a skim-milk diet. Close as a vice behold the nation's fist! Vain will be mouths made up for Civil List! And humble pray'rs, so very stale, Will all be call'd an old wife's tale. Your faithful Commons to your cravings Will not give up the nation's savings— Your fav'rite minister, I'm told, runs restiff, And growls at such petitions like a mastiff. What if my good friend Hastings goes to pot? Adams and Anstruther have flung hard stones— He finds his situation rather hot— Burke, Fox, and Sheridan, may break his bones. As surely as we saw and felt the bulse, Hastings hath got a very awkard pulse; Therefore in jeopardy the culprit stands! Like patients whose disorders doctors slight Too often, he may bid us all good night; And slip, poor man, between our hands. Then, sir!—oh! then, as long as life endures, Nought but remembrance of the bulse is ours; And to a stomach that like ours digests, Slight is the dinner on remember'd feasts. I think we cases understand, and ken Symptoms, as well as most ingenious men; But Lord! how oft the wisest are mistaken! Therefore I tremble for his badger'd bacon. We may be out, with all our skill so clever, And what we think an ague, prove jail fever. Nebuchadnezzar, sir, the king, As sacred hist'ries sweetly sing, Was on all fours turn'd out to grass, Just like a horse, or mule, or ass: Heav'ns! what a fall from kingly glory! I hope it will not so turn out That we shall have (to make a rout) A second part of that old story! This pension was well meant, O glorious king, And for the bard a very pretty thing; But let me, sir, refuse it, I implore— I ought not to be rich whilst you are poor; No, sir, I cannot be your humble hack; I fear your majesty would break my back. I dare refuse you for another reason— We differ in religion, sir, a deal: You fancy it a sin ally'd to treason, And vastly dangerous to the commonweal, For subjects, minuets and jigs to play On the Lord's day. Now, sir, I'm very fond of fiddling— And, in my morals, what the world calls middling: I've ask'd my conscience, that came straight from Heav'n, Whether I stood a chance to be forgiv'n, If on a Sunday, from all scruples free, I scrap'd the old Black Joke and chere amie. ‘Ah! fool (exclaim'd my conscience), know, God never against music made a rule; On Sundays you may safely take your bow— And play as well the fiddle as the fool.’ A late archbishop Cornwallis., too, O king, Who knew most secrets of the skies, Said, Heav'n on Sundays relish'd pipe and string Where sounds on sounds unceasing rise— And ask'd, as Sunday had its music there, Why Sunday should not have its music here. In consequence of this divine opinion, That prince of parsons in your great dominion, Inform'd his fashionable wife, That she might have her Sunday routs and cards; And meet at last with Heav'n's rewards, When death should take her precious life. Thus dropping pious qualms, religious doubts, His lady did enjoy her Sunday routs! Upon Good-Friday too, that awful day, Lo! like Vauxhall, was Lambeth all so gay! Now if his present grace, with sharpen'd eyes, Could squint a little deeper in the skies, He might be able to inform his dame Of two impostors, p'rhaps, call'd sin and shame, Who many a pleasure from our grasp remove, Pretending to commissions from above. Like this, a secret, could his grace explore, What a proud day for us and Mistress Moore; For lo, two greater foes we cannot name To this world's joys than Messieurs Sin and Shame. Then might we think no more of praise and pray'r, But leave at will our Maker in the lurch: Sleep, racket, lie a bed, or take the air, And send our servants and the dogs to church. Sunday, like other days, would then have life: Now prim, and starch, and silent, as a quaker— And gloomy in her looks, as if the wife Or widow of an undertaker, Happy should I have been, my liege, So great a monarch to oblige: And, sir, between you, and the post, And me you don't know what you've lost. The loss of me, so great a bard, Is not, O king! to be repair'd. My verse superior to the hardest rock, Nor earthquake fears, nor sea, nor fire; Surpassing, therefore, Mistress Damer's block, That boasts so strong a likeness of you, sire. That block, so pond'rous, must with age decay, And all the lines of wisdom wear away: I grant the lady's loyalty and love; Yet, ‘none but Phidias should attempt a Jove.’ The Macedonian hero grac'd the stone Of fam'd Praxiteles alone; Forbidding others to attempt his nob, It was so great and difficult a job. Augustus swore an oath so dread, He'd cut off any poet's head, But Virgil's, that should dare his praise rehearse, Or mention ev'n his name in verse. Then, sir, if I may be a little free, My art would suit your merits to a T. Lord! in my adamantine lays Your virtues would like bonfires blaze— So firm your tuneful jeweller would set 'em, They'd break the teeth of Time to eat 'em. Wrapp'd in the splendour of my golden line, For ever would your majesty be fine! Appear a gentleman of first repute, And always glitter in a birth-day suit. Then to all stories would I give the lie, That dar'd attack you, and your fame devour; Making a king a ninepin in our eye, Who ought like Egypt's pyramids to tow'r; Such as the following fable, for example; Of impudence, unprecedented sample! THE ROYAL SHEEP. Some time ago a dozen lambs, Two rev'rend patriarchial rams, And one good motherly old ewe, Died on a sudden down at Kew; Where, with the sweetest innocence, alas! Those pretty inoffensive lambs, And rev'rend horned patriarchal rams, And motherly old ewe, were nibbling grass: All, the fair property of our great king, Whose deaths did much the royal bosom wring. 'Twas said that dogs had tickled them to death; Play'd with their gentle throats, and stopp'd their breath. Like Homer's heroes on th' ensanguin'd plain, Stalk'd Mister Robinson The hind. around the slain! And never was more frighten'd in his life! So shock'd was Mister Robinson's whole face, Not stronger horrors could have taken place, Had Cerberus devour'd his wife! With wild, despairing looks, and sighs, And wet and pity-asking eyes, He, trembling to the royal presence ventur'd— White as the whitest napkin when he enter'd! White as the man who sought King Priam's bed, And told him that his warlike son was dead. ‘O please your majesty’—he, blubb'ring cried— And then stopp'd short— ‘What? what? what? what?’ the staring king replied— ‘Speak, Robinson, speak, speak, what, what's the hurt?’ ‘O, sire,’ said Robinson again— ‘Speak’—said the king—‘put, put me out of pain— Don't, don't in this suspense a body keep’— ‘O sire;’ cried Robinson, ‘the sheep! the sheep!’ ‘What of the sheep?’—replied the king, ‘pray, pray, Dead! Robinson, dead, dead, or run away?’ ‘Dead! answer'd Robinson; dead! dead! dead! dead!’ Then like a drooping lily, hung his head! ‘How, how?’ the monarch ask'd, with visage sad— ‘By dogs,’ said Robinson, ‘and likely mad!’ ‘No, no, they can't be mad, they can't be mad— ‘No, no, things arn't so bad, things arn't so bad,’ Rejoin'd the king; ‘Off with them quick to market—quick, depart;— In with them, in, in with them in a cart— Sell, sell them for as much as they will bring.’ Now to Fleet Market, driving like the wind, Amidst the murder'd mutton, rode the hind Mister Robinson., All in the royal cart so great, To try to sell the royal meat. The news of this rare batch of lambs, And ewe and rams, Design'd for many a London dinner, Reach'd the fair ears of Master Sheriff Skinner, Who, with a hammer and a conscience clear, Gets glory and ten thousands pounds a year; And who, if things go tolerably fair, Will be one day proud London's proud Lord Mayor. The alderman was in his pulpip shining, 'Midst gentlemen with nightcaps, hair, and wigs; In language most rhetorical defining The sterling merit of a lot of pigs: When suddenly the news was brought, That in Fleet Market were unwholesome sheep; Which made the preacher from his pulpit leap, As nimble as a tailor or as thought. For justice panting, and unaw'd by fears, This king, this emperor of auctioneers, Set off—a furious face, indeed, he put on— Like lightning did he gallop up Cheapside! Like thunder down through Ludgate did he ride, To catch the man who sold this dreadful mutton. Now to Fleet Market full of wrath he came, And with the spirit of an ancient Roman, Exceeded I believe by no man, The alderman, so virtuous, cried out ‘shame!’ ‘D?mme,’ to Robinson said Master Skinner, ‘Who on such mutton, sir, can make a dinner?— ‘You, if you please,’ Cried Mister Robinson, with perfect ease. ‘Sir!’—quoth the red-hot alderman again— ‘You,’—quoth the hind, in just the same cool strain. ‘Off, off,’ cried Skinner, ‘with your carrion heap— Quick, d?mme, take away your nasty sheep.’ Whilst I command, not e'en the king Shall such vile stuff to market bring, And London stalls such garbage put on— So please to take away your stinking mutton.’ ‘You,’ replied Robinson, ‘you cry out “Shame!” You blast the sheep, good Master Skinner, pray; You give the harmless mutton a bad name! You impudently order it away! Sweet Master Alderman, don't make this rout: Pray clap your spectacles upon your snout; And then your keen, surveying eyes regale With those same fine large letters on the cart Which brought this blasted mutton here for sale.’— Poor Skinner read, and read it with a start. Like Hamlet, frighten'd at his father's ghost, The alderman stood staring, like a post; He saw G. R. inscrib'd, in handsome letters, Which prov'd the sheep belong'd unto his betters. The alderman now turn'd to deep reflection, And being blest with proper recollection, Exclaim'd—‘I've made a great mistake—Oh! sad— The sheep are really not so bad, Dear Mister Robinson, I beg your pardon, Your Job-like patience I've born hard on; Whoever says the mutton is not good, Knows nothing, Mister Robinson, of food; I verily believe I could turn glutton, On such neat, wholesome, pretty-looking mutton— Pray, Mister Robinson, the mutton sell— I hope, sir, that his majesty is well.’ So saying, Mr. Robinson he quitted, With cherubimic smiles and placid brows, For such embarrassing occasions fitted— Adding just five and twenty humble bows. To work went Robinson to sell the sheep; But people would not buy, except dog-cheap Indeed the mutton could be sold only for dog's meat.: At length the sheep were sold—without the fleece— And brought King George just half-a-crown a piece. Now for the other saucy lying story, Made, one would think, to tarnish kingly glory. THE KING AND PARSON YOUNG. The king (God bless him) met old Parson Young Walking on Windsor Terrace one fair morning— Delightful was the day—the scent was strong— A heavenly day for howling and for horning! For tearing farmers' hedges down,—hallooings— Shouts, curses, oaths, and such-like pious doings. ‘Young,’ cried the king, ‘d'ye hunt, d'ye hunt today? Yes, yes—what, what? yes, yes, fine day, fine day.’ Low with a rev'rend bow the priest replied, ‘Great king! I really have no horse to ride; Nothing, O monarch, but my founder'd mare, And she, my liege, as blind as she can stare.’ ‘No horse!’ rejoin'd the king, ‘no horse, no horse!’ ‘Indeed,’ the parson added, ‘I have none: Nothing but poor old Dobbin—who of course Is dangerous—being blinder than a stone.’ ‘Blind, blind, Young? never mind—you must, must go; Must hunt, must hunt, Young—Stay behind?—no, no.’ What pity, that the king, n his discourse, Forgot to say, ‘I'll lend ye, Young, a horse!’ The king to Young behaving thus so kind, Whate'er the danger, and howe'er inclin'd, At home with politesse Young could not stay— So up his rev'rence got upon the mare, Resolv'd the chase with majesty to share, And risk the dangers of the day. Rous'd was the deer!—the king and Parson Young, Castor and Pollux like, rode side by side; When lo, a ditch was to be sprung! Over leap'd George the Third with kingly pride. Over leap'd Tinker, Towzer, Rockwood, Towler, Over leap'd Mendall, Brushwood, Jubal, Jowler, Trimbush and Lightning, Music, Ranter, Wonder, And fifty others with their mouths of thunder— Great names! whose pedigrees so fair, With those of Homer's heroes might compare. Thus gloriously attended, leap'd the king, By all those hounds attended with a spring!— Not Cæsar's self a fiercer look put on, When with his host he pass'd the Rubicon! But wayward Fate the parson's palfrey humbled, And gave the mare a sudden check— Unfortunately poor blind Dobbin stumbled, And broke his reverence's neck. The monarch, gaping, with amaze look'd round Upon his dead companion on the ground— ‘What, what?’ he cried, ‘Young dead! Young dead! Young dead!— Humph!—take him up—and put him home to bed.’ Thus having finish'd—with a cheerful face Nimrod the Second join'd the jovial chase. A MORAL REFLECTION. Fools would have stopp'd when Parson Young was kill'd, And giv'n up ev'ry thought of hound and deer, And with a weakness, call'd compassion, fill'd, Had turn'd Samaritan, and dropp'd a tear. But better far the royal sportsman knew— He guess'd the consequence, beyond a doubt— Full well he guess'd he should not have a view, And that he should be shamefully thrown out. P'rhaps from the royal eye a tear might hop; Yet pages swear they never saw it drop. But majesty may say—‘What, what, what's death? Nought, nought, nought but a little loss of breath.’ To Parson Young 'twas more, I'm very clear— He lost by death some hundred pounds a year. A great deal, my dear liege, depends On having clever bards for friends— What had Achilles been without his Homer?— A tailor, woollen-draper, or a comber! Fellows that have been dead a hundred year, None but the Lord knows how or where. In Poetry's rich grass how virtues thrive!— Some when put in, so lean, seem scarce alive; And yet, so speedily a bulk obtain, That ev'n their owners know them not again. Could you, indeed, have gain'd my muse of fire, Great would your luck have been, indeed, great sire!— Then had I prais'd your nobleness of spirit!— Then had I boasted that myself, Hight Peter, was the first blest, tuneful elf, You ever gave a farthing to for merit. Though money be a pretty handy tool; Of mammon, lo! I scorn to be the fool! If Fortune calls, she's welcome to my cot, Whether she leaves a guinea or a groat; Whether she brings me from the butcher's shop The whole sheep or a simple chop. For lo! like Andrew Marvel, I can dine, And deem a mutton-bone extremely fine— Then, sir, how difficult the task, you see, To bribe a moderate gentleman like me. I will not swear, point blank, I shall not alter— A saint Saint Peter.—my namesake e'en was known to faulter. Nay more—some clever men in opposition, Whose souls did really seem in good condition; Who made of Pitt such horrible complaint, And damn'd him for the worst of knaves; Alter'd their minds—became Pitt's abject slaves, And publish'd their new patron for a saint. And who is there that may not change his mind? Where can you folks of that description find Who will not sell their souls for cash, That most angelic, diabolic trash! E'en grave divines submit to glitt'ring gold! The best of consciences are bought and sold: As in a tale I'll show, most edifying, And prove to all the world that I'm not lying. THE PARSON, THE SQUIRE, AND THE SPANIEL. A TALE. A gentleman possess'd a fav'rite spaniel, That never treated maid nor man ill: This dog, of whom we cannot too much say, Got from his godfather the name of Tray. After ten years of service just, Tray, like the race of mortals, sought the dust— That is to say, the spaniel died: A coffin then was order'd to be made, The dog was in the churchyard laid, And o'er his pale remains the master cried. Lamenting much his trusty fur-clad friend, And willing to commemorate his end, He rais'd a small blue stone, just after burial, And, weeping, wrote on it this sweet memorial: TRAY's EPITAPH. Here rest the relics of a friend below, Blest with more sense than half the folks I know: Fond of his ease, and to no parties prone, He damn'd no sect, but calmly gnaw'd his bone; Perform'd his functions well in ev'ry way— Blush, Christians, if you can, and copy Tray. The curate of the Huntingtonian band, Rare breed of gospel-hawks that scour the land, And fierce on sins their quarry fall, Dread locusts, that would eat us all: Men who, with new-invented patent eyes, See Heav'n and all the angels in the skies; As plain as in the box of showman Swiss, For little master made, and curious miss, We see with huge delight the king of France With all his lords and ladies dance. This curate heard th' affair with deep emotion, And thus exclaim'd, with infinite devotion: ‘O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! Fine doings these, upon my word! This, truly, is a very pretty thing! What will become of this most shocking world? How richly such a rogue deserves to swing, And then to Satan's hottest flames be hurl'd! Oh! by this damned deed how I am hurried! A dog in Christian ground be buried! And have an epitaph forsooth so civil: Egad! old maids will presently be found Clapping their dead ram cats in holy ground, And writing verses on each mousing devil.’ Against such future casualty providing, The priest set off, like Homer's Neptune, striding, Vowing to put the culprit in the court; He found him at the spaniel's humble grave; Not praying, no, nor singing of a stave; And thus began t'abusehim—not exhort— ‘Son of the Dev'l, what hast thou done? Nought for the action can atone— I should not wonder if the great All-wise Quick darted down his lightning all so red, And dash'd to earth that wretched head, Which dar'd so foul, so base an act devise. Bury a dog like Christian folk!— None but the fiend of darkness could provoke A man to perpetrate a deed so odd: Our inquisition soon the tale shall hear, And quickly your fine fleece shall shear: Why, such a villain can't believe in God!’ ‘Softly! my rev'rend sir,’ the 'squire replied— ‘Tray was as good a dog as ever died— No education could his morals mend— And what, perhaps, sir, you may doubt, Before his lamp of life went out, He order'd you a legacy, my friend.’ ‘Did he?—poor dog!’ the soften'd priest rejoin'd, In accents pitiful and kind; ‘What! was it Tray? I'm sorry for poor Tray:— Why, truly, dogs of such rare merit, Such real nobleness of spirit, Should not like common dogs be put away. Well! pray what was it that he gave, Poor fellow! ere he sought the grave? I guess I may put confidence, sir, in ye.’— ‘A piece of gold,’ the gentleman reply'd— ‘I'm much oblig'd to Tray,’ the parson cry'd; So left God's cause, and pocketed the guinea. Yet should I imitate the fickle wind, Or Mister patriot Eden—change my mind; And for the bard your majesty should send, And say, ‘Well well, well well, my tuneful-friend, I long, I long, to give you something, Peter— You make fine verses—nothing can be sweeter— What will you have? what, what? speak out—speak out— Yes, yes, you something want, no doubt, no doubt:’ Or should you, like some men who gravely preach, Forsake your usual short-hand mode of speech, And thus begin—in Bible-phrase sublime; ‘What shall be done for our rare son of rhime? The bard who full of wisdom writeth? The man in whom the king delighteth?’ Then would the poet thankfully reply, With fault'ring voice, low bow, and marv'ling eye All meekness! such a simple, dove-like thing! ‘Blest be the bard who verses can indite, To yield a second Solomon delight! Thrice blest, who findeth favour with the king! Since 'tis the royal will to give the bard In whom the king delighteth, some reward, Some mark of royal bounty to requite him; O king! do any thing but knight him.’ PETER's PROPHECY, OR THE PRESIDENT AND POET, OR AN IMPORTANT EPISTLE TO SIR J. BANKS, ON THE APPROACHING ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY. Tros, Rutilusve fuat, nullo discrimine habebo. VIRGIL. Rank is a farce—if people fools will be, A scavenger and king's the same to me. La Societé Royale de Londres fut formée en 1660, six ans avant notre Académie des Sciences. Elle n'a point de recompences comme la notre: mais aussi elle est libre. Point de ces distinctions désagreables, inventées par l'Abbe Bignon, qui distribua l'Académie des Sciences en Savans qu'on payait, et en Honoraires qui n'etoient pas Savans. La Societé de Londres independante, et n'etant encouragée que par elle même, a été composée de sujets qui ont trouvé le Calcul de l'Infini, les Lois de la Lumière, celles de Pesanteur, l'Abberration des Etoiles, la Telescope de Reflexion, la Pompe a Feu, le Microscope Solaire, et beaucoup d'autres inventions aussi utiles qu'admirables. Qu'auroient fait de plus ces (grands hommes s'ils avoient été pensionnaires ou honoraires? VOLTAIRE, sur la Societé Royale. THE ARGUMENT. A sublime and poetical Exordium, in which the Bard applaudeth himself, condemneth his Sovereign, and condescendeth to instruct Sir Joseph Banks, F.R.S.—Anecdote of Julius Cæsar and a Conjuror—Peter dwelleth with much Solemnity on the gloomy Month of November, and compareth Sir Joseph Banks to Jupiter and Mr. Squib—Asketh shrewd Questions—Sir Joseph comprehendeth their sage Meaning, and flieth into a Passion, and boasteth how he revengeth himself on the Fun the World enjoyeth at his Expense—Sir Joseph animadverteth wisely on a Fall from the Presidency to the State of a simple Fellow, obliquely and nobly hinting at a few Traits of his own Character—Peter replieth with good Advice, exhibiting at the same Time acute Knowledge of the sexual system in botanical affairs—Sir Joseph refuseth Peter's Counsel—Peter mentioneth Men of Science, whom Sir Joseph scorneth—Sir Joseph letteth the Cat out of the Bag, and showeth Principles inimical to the Cause of true Philosophy, by wishing to make great Men Fellows, instead of wise Men—Peter moralizeth with Profundity, and flappeth the Bugs of Fortune for daring, on Account of their Mammon, to place themselves on a Level with Genius—Sir Joseph maketh more Discovery of his Disposition, by abusing Painting, Poetry, and Music, and wisheth to tread in the Steps of his Sovereign—Peter illustrateth the President's mode of catching at an Argument, by a beautiful Spider Simile—Sir Joseph boasteth of his Tea and Toast Weapons—Peter animadverteth with his usual Wisdom on the miraculous Powers of Meat, when applied to a hungry Stomach—Sir Joseph findeth out a new Road to the Heart—Boasteth of royal Favour—Peter smileth at it, and frighteneth Sir Joseph—Sir Joseph inquireth the World's Opinion of himself—Peter giveth it without Ceremony—Sir Joseph curseth—Peter prayeth him to be quiet, proceedeth, and telleth terrible Things—Sir Joseph sweareth—Praiseth himself—Peter answereth—Sir Joseph praiseth himself again for his being able to lead great Folks by the Nose, and braggeth of royal Whispers—Peter guesseth at the royal Whispers, and expresseth Pleasure thereat—Again boasteth the President of what he can do—Peter solemnly smileth in a superb Simile taken from wild Beasts—Sir Joseph vaunteth on his great Acquaintance with Vegetables and Monkeys—Peter acquiesceth in his Monkey Wisdom, but denieth its Importance, and turneth Butterfly and Egg Knowledges over to idle old Maids—Peter acknowledgeth the Merits of Indian, Booby, and Noddy killing; Lizard, Bat, Scurvygrass, and Lady-smock Hunting, yet differeth with Sir Joseph as to the Idea of its Importance—The President again boasteth—Peter solemnly replieth, and telleth strange Matters of Sir William Hamilton, Sir Joseph breaketh out violently, and with an Air of Defiance, on the Subject of Mr. Herschel—Peter acquiesceth, in some measure, on the Merits of Mr. Herschel, and prophesieth more Discoveries by this Astronomer than struck the Imagination of Sir Joseph—Peter prophesieth of the future Grandeur of Cheltenham, by Means of Mills to supply the great Flux of People with Paper—Peter giveth more Glory to Mr. Herschel's Glass, than to Mr. Herschel's Head—Sir Joseph groweth abusive—Peter properly replieth—Sir Joseph again triumpheth—Peter cutteth him down for his Laud on his Grace of Marlborough's Spy-glass Discoveries, and John Hunter's Sows and Partridges—Sir Joseph plumeth himself on Dr. Blagden—Peter praiseth Dr. Blagden—Sir Joseph praiseth Sir Benjamin Thompson, Lord Mulgrave, and the unassuming Quaker Dr. Lettsom; moreover praiseth the Doctor's Hobby Horse, Mangel Worsal, alias Wurtzel—Sir Joseph inquireth the Merits of Mr. Aubert, the Silkman—Peter smileth, and answereth wittily—Sir Joseph inquireth about Mr. Daines Barrington—Peter answereth in like Manner—Sir Joseph's Ire boileth over—Peter laugheth—Peter cometh to the Point, and telleth the President in plain Terms that he must depend on the many, more than one, meaning our most gracious King—Sir Joseph exclaimeth with his usual Vulgarity, and taxeth the revolting Members with Ingratitude, and flieth to Meat and Drink for his future Supporters—Peter praiseth Meat and Drink, yet insisteth on the Truth of an intended Rebellion—Sir Joseph, in a Strain of Despondency, looketh to the Lord for Support—Peter giveth him no Hopes from that Quarter—Sir Joseph, in a Tyger-like Manner, breaketh out into Rage and Boasting—Peter acknowledgeth his Merits, but informeth the President of their Insufficiency—Sir Joseph voweth to play the Devil—Peter exalteth Sir Joseph's intended Manœuvre by a Comparison of a Miracle frequently worked in Popish Countries on Rats and Grasshoppers—Peter still harpeth on the old String of something more—Sir Joseph adduceth more Instances of Merit, such as eating Matters that would make a Hottentot vomit—Peter acknowledgeth Sir Joseph's uncommon Stomach-powers and Triumphs over Reptiles; but with Obstinacy insisteth upon it that something more must be achieved— The President upon this, most wickedly, yet most heroically, declareth, that he will then swallow an Alligator—Peter dissuadeth Sir Joseph, like a Friend, from his bold Intention, and recommendeth a Meal of a milder Quality. The bard who fill'd with friendship's purest fire, Tun'd to a mighty king the moral lyre; With all the magic of the muse's art, Smil'd at his foibles and enlarg'd Verily the lyric bard hath cause to triumph—by means of a few hints, the close fist of royal economy hath been a little unclenched. By God's grace, and the poet's good health, greater things are likely to be accomplished, such is the power of song! his heart— Ungrateful prince! like most of modern times, Who never thank'd the poet for his rhimes: The bard with wisdom's voice sublimely strong, Who scar'd the maids of honour with his song, Turn'd courtiers pale, and turn'd to silent wonder Ambassadors, at truth's deep tone of thunder; Who in their country (such a timid thing!) Was never known to whisper to a king: The bard who dar'd undaunted thus to tow'r, And boldly oracles to princes pour, Stoops from the zenith of his eagle flight To give instructions to a simple knight. To Cæsar, who th' advice with scorn repaid, ‘Beware the ides of March,’ a conj'ror said. More rev'renc'd let a greater conj'ror say, ‘Beware, Sir Joseph Banks, St. Andrew's day.’ Near is the gloomy month, and gloomy hour, When of your plumage stripp'd, and fav'rite pow'r, You quit that mace and pompous chair of state, And cease Lord Paramount of Moth debate, That awe-inspiring hammer'd fist to rear, Like scepter'd Jove, and Squib the auctioneer! SIR JOSEPH. Well! what's November's On the thirtieth of November the president is annually elected. gloomy month or hour? The day which ravishes, restores my pow'r. PETER. Perchance ambition may be doom'd to mourn! Perchance your honours may no more return! Think what a host of enemies you make! What feeling mind would be a bull at stake? Pinch'd by this mongrel, by that mastiff torn: Who'd make a feast to treat the public scorn? Who'd be a bear that grasps his club with pride With which his dancing master drubs his hide? None, dear Sir Joseph, but the arrant'st fool Turns butt to catch the shafts of ridicule. SIR JOSEPH. You meaning, friend, I easily divine! PETER. Yes, quit for life the chair—resign, resign. SIR JOSEPH. No! with contempt the grinning world I see, And always laugh at those who laugh at me. PETER. To steal a point then, may I never thrive But you must be the merriest man alive. SIR JOSEPH. Good!—but, my friend, 'twould be a black November, To lose the chair, and sneak a vulgar member; Sit on a bench mumchance without my hat The president always wears his hat., Sunk from a lion to a tame tom cat: Just like a schoolboy trembling o'er his book, Afraid to move, or speak, or think, or look, When Mr. President, with mastiff air, Vouchsafes to grumble ‘Silence’ from the chair. PETER. All this is mortifying to be sure, And more than flesh and blood can well endure! Then to your turnip fields in peace retire: Return like Cincinnatus, country 'squire: Go with your wisdom, and amaze the boors With appletree, and shrub, and flow'r amours; And tell them all, with wide-mouth'd wonder big, How gnats can make a cuckold of a fig See the natural history of the fig,. Form fly clubs, shell clubs, weed clubs, if you please, And proudly reign the president of these: Go, and with periwinkle wisdom charm; With loves of lobsters, oysters, crabs, alarm; And tell them how, like ours, the females woo'd, By kissing, people all the realms of mud: Thus, though proud London dares refuse you fame, The towns of Lincolnshire shall raise your name, Knock down the bear, and bull, and calf, and king, And bid Sir Joseph on their signposts swing. SIR JOSEPH. No! since I've fairly mounted Fortune's mast, Till fate shall chop my hands off, I'll hold fast. PETER. And yet, Sir Joseph, fame reports you stole To Fortune's topmast through the lubberhole A part of the ship well known to seamen.. Think of the men, whom science so reveres! Horsley, and Wilson, Maskelyne, Maseres, Landen, and Hornsby, Atwood, Glenie, Hutton,— SIR JOSEPH. Blockheads! for whom I do not care a button! Fools, who to mathematics would confine us, And bother all our ears with plus and minus. PETER. No more they search the philosophic mine, To bid the journals with their labours shine, And yield a glorious splendour to the page, Such as when Newton, Halley grac'd the age! Retir'd, those members now behold with sighs The dome, like Egypt, swarm with frogs and flies; And you, the Pharaoh too without remorse, The stubborn parent of the reptile curse; See wisdom yield to folly's rude controul; Jove's eagle murder'd by a mousing owl Vide Shakespeare.. SIR JOSEPH. Poh! poh! my friend, I've star-gazers enough; I now look round for different kind of stuff: Besides—untitled members are mere swine; I wish for princes on my list to shine; I'll have a company of stars and strings; I'll have a proud society of kings! I'll have no miserable squeal tomtit, Whilst Fortune offers pheasants to my spit! For me, the dev'l may take a nameless fry— No sprats, no sprats, whilst whales can feast my eye. PETER. Thus on a stall, amidst a country fair, Old women shew of gingerbread their ware! King David and Queen Bathsheba behold, Strut from their dough majestic, grac'd with gold! King Solomon so great in all his glory, The Queen of Sheba too, renown'd in story! The grannies these display with doting eyes; Delighted see them all the louts surprise; Whilst no poor bak'd Plebeian, great or small, Dares shew his sneaking nose upon the stall! Sir Joseph, do not fancy that by fate Great wisdom goes with titles and estate! I grant that pride and insolence appear Where purblind Fortune thousands gives a year. Too many of Fortune's insects have I seen, Proud of some little name, with scornful mien, High o'er the head of modest genius rise, Pert, foppish, whiffling, flutt'ring butterflies! Weak imps! on whom their planets all so kind, In pity to their poverty of mind, Around them treasure bountifully shed, Convinc'd the fools would want a bit of bread. SIR JOSEPH. Since truth must out, then know, my biting friend, Philosophers my soul with horror rend; Whene'er their mouths are open'd, I am mum— Plague take 'em, should a president be dumb, I loath the arts—the universe may know it— I hate a painter, and I hate a poet— To these two ears, a bear Marchesi growls, Mara and Billington a brace of owls. To circles of pure ignorance conduct me; I hate the company that can instruct me; I wish to imitate my king, so nice, Great prince, who ne'er was known to take advice! Who keeps no company (delightful plan!) That dares be wiser than himself, good man! PETER. In troth, Sir Joseph, I have often seen ye Look in debate a little like a ninny, Struggling to grasp the sense with mouth, hands, eyes, And with the philosophic speaker rise; Just like a spider brush'd by Susan's broom, That tries to claw its thread, and mount the room, Poor sprawling reptile, but with humbled air Condemn'd to sneak away behind a chair. SIR JOSEPH. Still to the point—a rout let fellows make; My pow'r is too well fix'd for such to shake; My sure artill'ry hath o'ercome a host. PETER. I own the great, past pow'rs of tea and toast! Ven'son's a Cæsar in the fiercest fray: Turtle an Alexander in its way: And then, in quarrels of a slighter nature, Mutton's a most successful mediator! So much superior is the stomach's smart To all the vaunted horrors of the heart; E'en love, who often triumphs in his grief, Hath ceas'd to feed on sighs to feed on beef. SIR JOSEPH. Yes, yes, my friend, my tea and butter'd rolls Have found an easy pass to people's souls: My well-tim'd dinners (certain folks revere) Have left this easy bosom nought to fear. The turnpike road to people's hearts I find, Lies through their guts, or I mistake mankind; Besides, whilst thus I boast my sov'reign's smile, Let raggamuffins rage, and rogues revile. PETER. Alas! Sir Joseph! grant the king you please, Which ev'ry courtier's eye with envy sees; A glorious thing too, no man can deny it; Though no man ever got a sixpence by it; Yet of our lucky island, certain kings, Far from all-mighty, are not mighty things; And though with many a wren you make him blest, And many a tomtit's egg and tomtit's nest; And many a monkey stuff'd to make him grin, And many a flea and beetle on a pin; And promise (to cajole the royal mind) To make his butcher member, and his hind; It is not he, with Polyphemus stare, And stern command, perpetuates the chair! I know that disaffection taints the throng, And know the world is lavish in its tongue. SIR JOSEPH. Ah! tell me fairly without more delay, What 'tis the blackguard world hath dar'd to say; Perhaps a pretty devil I'm portray'd; The world's free brush deals damnably in shade. PETER. Thus, then, ‘How dares that man his carcase squat, Bold in the sacred chair where Newton sat; Whose eye could Nature's darkest veil pervade, And, sun-like, view the solitary maid; Pursue the wand'rer through each secret maze, And on her labours dart a noontide blaze? When to the chair Banks forc'd his bold ascent, He crawl'd a bug upon the monument.’ SIR JOSEPH. Curse them! PETER. Have patience, dear Sir Joseph, pray! I have not mention'd half the people say:— Thus then again, ‘He beats the bears, so rude, With bulldog aspect, and with brains of mud: His words, like stones for pavements, make us start; Rude, roughly rumbling, tumbling from the cart; Who for importance all his lungs employs, And thinks that words, like drums, were made for noise. A fellow so unqualified to shine! Who never to the Journals gave a line; But into Sweden cast a fox-like look, And caught Goose Dryander to write his book A most pompous birth in the botanical way is to make its appearance soon; Sir Joseph the reputed father, though Jonas Dryander, the Swede, his secretary, begets it.. Such is the mania for the claps of fame, So sought by many a 'squire and gentle dame, Resembling beggars that on alms grow fat; Who, if too weak themselves to make a brat, Buy children up to melt the trav'ler's eye, And from his pocket call the charity. Through him each trifle-hunter that can bring A grub, a weed, a moth, a beetle's wing, Shall to a fellow's dignity succeed; Witness Lord Chatham and his piss-a-bed Vulgarly called dandelion. Something of this kind (a most wonderful species!) was presented by the eldest born of the great Pitt, for which he was created F. R. S.! How had he pow'rs to muster up the face To ask a president's important place? How with a matchless insolence to dare Abuse and jostle Pringle About the year 1779, conductors were ordered to be placed near all our magazines, to secure them from the effects of lightning. A question then arose, which would best succeed, blunt or pointed conductors. Sir John Pringle, with the sensible part of the Society, were of opinion, as, indeed, was Dr. Franklin, that points were preferable—Sir Joseph Banks and his party roared loudly for the blunts.—The dispute ran so high, that his majesty took a part in it; and being rather partial to blunt conductors, thought to put an end to the matter by giving his own peremptory decision, and announcing to the world the superiority of nobs. To confirm his great and wise opinion, nobs were actually fixed on iron rods at the end of Buckingham House. This, however, was not all; on the birth-day, his majesty desired Sir John to give it to the world as the opinion of the Royal Society, that Dr. Franklin was wrong. The president replied, like a man, that it was not in his power to reverse the order of nature. The sovereign could not easily see that, and therefore repeated his commands.—Teased by the king from time to time to oppose the decided opinion of the rebellious Franklin, and the laws of nature; and constantly barked at by Sir Joseph and his moth-hunting phalanx, he resigned the chair and returned to Scotland.—The honour was instantaneously snapped at and caught by the present possessor, such as he is! from the chair? A moth-hunter, a crab-catcher, a bat, That owes its sole existence to a gnat! A hunter of the meanest reptile breed, A f?l that crosses oceans for a weed! Once tow'ring Science made Crane Court The Royal Society's rooms are removed from Crane Court to Somerset Place. her home, And heav'n-born Wisdom patroniz'd the dome; With awful aspect at the portal shone, And to her mansion woo'd the wise alone; Now at the door see moon-ey'd Folly grin, Inviting birds'-nest hunters to come in: Idiots who specks on eggs devoutly ken, And furbish up a folio on a wren.’ You see the world, Sir Joseph, scorns to flatter— SIR JOSEPH. By G?d! I think it hath not minc'd the matter. Yet, by the Pow'r who made me, Peter, know, I'm honour'd, star'd at, wheresoe'er I go! Soon as a room I enter, lo, all ranks Get up to compliment Sir Joseph Banks!— PETER. And then sit down again, I do suppose; And then around the room a whisper goes, ‘Lord, that's Sir Joseph Banks!—how grand his look Who sail'd all round the world with Captain Cook! SIR JOSEPH. Zounds! what the devil's fame if this be not? PETER. Sir Joseph, prithee don't be such a sot— Those wonderful admirers, man, were dozens Of fresh imported, staring country cousins; To London come, the waxwork to devour, And see their brother beasts within the Tow'r: True fame is praise by men of wisdom giv'n, Whose souls display some workmanship of Heav'n; Not by the wooden million—Nature's chips, Whose twilight souls are ever in eclipse; Puppies! who, though on idiotism's dark brink, Because they've heads, dare fancy they can think. SIR JOSEPH. What though unletter'd In spite of our objection to Sir Joseph as a President, we must allow his candour in acknowledging himself unlettered, as he really was refused his degree at Cambridge, though every interest was implored to make him pass muster., I can lead the herd, And laugh at half the members to their beard. Frequent to Court I go, and midst the ring, I catch most gracious whispers from the king— PETER. And well (I think) I hear each precious speech, In sentiment sublime, and language rich; ‘What's new, Sir Joseph? what, what's new found out? What's the society, what, what about? Any more monsters, lizard, monkey, rat, Egg, weed, mouse, butterfly, pig, what, what, what? Toad, spider, grasshopper, Sir Joseph Banks? Any more thanks, more thanks, more thanks, more thanks? You still eat raw flesh, beetle, viper, bat, Toad, tadpole, frog, Sir Joseph, what, what, what?’ Such is the language of the first of kings, That many a sighing heart with envy stings! And much I'm pleas'd to fancy that I hear Such wise and gracious whispers greet your ear: Yet if the greater part of members growl, Though owls themselves, and curse you for an owl; And bent the great Sir Joseph Banks to humble, Behold the Giant President must tumble. SIR JOSEPH. Zounds! sir, the great ones to my whistle come; I have 'em every one beneath my thumb. Electors, Margraves, Princes, grace my list, And shall a few poor ragged rogues resist, Because (a flock of astronomic gulls) The cobweb mathematics cloud their skulls? The great, when beckon'd to, my cause shall aid, And happy think themselves with thanks o'erpaid: These shall arise, and with a single frown, Beat the bold front of opposition down. PETER. Thus by a word, the showman at the Tow'r Exerts on brother savages his pow'r; Bids Nero, Cæsar, Pompey, spread their paws, And show the dangers of their gaping jaws! SIR JOSEPH. By heav'ns! I've merit, say whate'er you please! Can name the vegetable tribes with ease— What monkey walks the woods or climbs a tree Whose genealogy's unknown to me? PETER. I grant you, sir, in monkey knowledge great; Yet say, should monkeys give you Newton's seat? Such merit scarcely is enough to dub A man a member of a country club. With novel specks on eggs to feast the eye, Or gaudy colours of a butterfly, Or new-found fibre of some grassy blade, Well suits the idle hours of some old maid (Whose sighs each lover's vanish'd sighs deplore), To murder time when Cupids kill no more; Not men, who, lab'ring with a Titan mind, Should scale the skies to benefit mankind, I grant you full of anecdote, my friend— Bon mots, and wondrous stories without end; Yet if a tale can claim, or jest so rare, Ten thousand gossips might demand the chair. To shoot at boobies ‘Great and manifold were Sir Joseph's triumphs over these defenceless animals,’ says Dr. Hawkesworth's most miserable account; which might more properly be christen'd ‘The History of Sir Joseph Banks,’ so much, indeed, is Sir Joseph the hero of the tale., noddies, with such luck, And pepper a poor Indian like a duck; To hunt for days a lizard or a gnat, And run a dozen miles to catch a bat; To plunge in marshes, and to scale the rocks, Sublime, for scurvygrass and lady-smocks See Hawkesworth's account of Captain Cook's voyage., Are matters of proud triumph, to be sure, And such as Fame's fair volume should secure: Yet to my mind, it is not such a feat, As gives a man a claim to Newton's seat. SIR JOSEPH. Yet are there men of genius who support me! Proud of my friendship, see Sir William court me! PETER. Great in the eating knowledge all allow; Who sent you once the sumen Sir W. Hamilton, who sent Sir Joseph from Italy this precious present—The mode of making it properly is, by tying the teats of a sow, soon after she hath littered, continuing the ligature till the poor creature is nearly exhausted with torture, and then cutting her throat. The effects of the milk diffused through this belly part are so delicious, as to be thought to make ample atonement for the barbarity. of a sow; Far richer food than pigs that lose their breath, Whipp'd like poor soldiers on parades, to death. Sir William, hand and glove with Naples' king! Who made with rare antiques the nation ring; Who when Vesuvius foam'd with melted matter, March'd up and clapp'd his nose into the crater, Just with the same sang froid that Joan the cook Casts on her dumplings in the crock a look. But more the world reports (I hope untrue) That half Sir William's mugs and gods are new; Himself the baker of th' Etrurian ware, That made our British antiquarians stare; Nay, that he means ere long to cross the main, And at his Naples oven sweat again; And by his late successes render'd bolder, To bake new mugs, and gods some ages older! SIR JOSEPH. God bless us! what to Herschel dare you say? The astronomic genius of the day, Who soon will find more wonders in the skies, And with more Georgium Siduses surprise? PETER. More Ætnas in the moon—more cinder loads! Perhaps mail coaches on her turnpike roads, By some great Lunar Palmer taught to fly, To gain the gracious glances of the eye Of some penurious prince of high degree, And charm the monarch with a postage free; Such as to Chelt'nam waters urg'd their way, Where Cloacina holds her easy sway; Where paper mills shall load with wealth the town, And ev'ry shop shall deal in whitish brown; Where for the coach the king was wont to watch, Loaded with fish, fowl, bacon, and dispatch Mr. Palmer very generously offered his sovereign a mail coach to carry letters and dispatches to and from Cheltenham—the offer was too great to be refused—a splendid carriage was built for the occasion: his most œconomic majesty, however, wisely knowing that something more than a few letters might be contained in Mr. Palmer's vehicle, converted it, as the poet hath observed, into a cart, and saved many a sixpence.; Eggs and small beer, potatoes, too, a store, That cost in Chelt'nam market twopence more; Converting thus a coach of matchless art, With two rare geldings, to a sutler's cart— But, voluble Sir Joseph—not so fast— The fame of Herschel is a dying blast: When on the moon he first began to peep, The wond'ring world pronounc'd the gazer deep: But wiser now th' un-wond'ring world, alas! Gives all poor Herschel's glory to his glass; Convinc'd his boasted astronomic strength, Lies in his tube's We should not detract from Mr. Herschel's real merit.—By a true German cart-horse labour, he made a little improvement on Dr. Mudge's method of constructing mirrors; such are this gentleman's pretensions to a niche in the temple of Fame.—As for his mathematical abilities, they can scarcely be called the shadows of science., not head's prodigious length. SIR JOSEPH. What, niggard, not on Herschel fame bestow, So curious a discov'rer?— PETER. No! man, no! Give it to Mudge Dr. Mudge of Plymouth., whose head contains more ???? Than (trust me) ever lodg'd in Herschel's house. SIR JOSEPH. Lo, at my call the noble Marlb'rough's vote, Whose observations much our fame promote. PETER. Who from his Blenheim chimneys wonders spies— The daily advertiser of the skies: Who equals his great ancestor in head; A hero The famous Duke of Marlborough was reported to have been a very illiterate man, which shows that a head-piece for the arts and sciences, and a head piece for facing cannon balls, are wisely formed of different materials. who could neither write nor read: Thus equal form'd, to all the world's surprise; As one swept earth, the other sweeps the skies. SIR JOSEPH. Hunter John Hunter actually received the Society's gold medal for three papers, viz. on sow-gelding; on the wolf, jackall, and dog; proving incontestably, what the world knew before, that the aforesaid animals were bonâ fide of the same species: and on the loves of whales. with fish intrigues our house regales— PETER. The tender history of cooing whales See article 30, 1780, in the Philosophical Transactions, where Mr. John Hunter gives a wonderful account of a pheasant with three legs, that by age changed from a female to a male.! SIR JOSEPH. Great in the noble art of gelding sows!— PETER. And giving to the boar a barren spouse! Who proves, what many unbelievers shocks, That age converts hen pheasants into cocks! And why not, since it is denied by no man, That age hath made John Hunter an old woman! Believe me, full as well might papists bring Quills from a seraph's tail, or cherub's wing; Saint Dunstan's crab stick, which the saint, uncivil, Broke on the back of our great foe, the Devil; Saint Andrew's toe, Saint Agatha's old smock, And stones that rattled round Saint Stephen's block; Saint Joseph's sighs so deep, preserv'd in bottles, Amounting, legends say, to many pottles; Caught as the saint with all his might and main, Was cleaving billets for his fire in twain; Or bones In 1762, four hundred saints were recruited. Such was the extraordinary harvest of baptized and canonized bones from the catacombs at Rome. Vid. Religious Rites and Ceremonies. from catacombs to form new saints, To cure, like all quack medicines, all complaints! Such might the journals of the house record, As well as Hunter's wond'rous cock-hen bird. SIR JOSEPH. Like Blagden who can write and deeply think? PETER. Who write like him on iron moulds and ink Vid. article 39, 1787, of the Philos. Trans.? See shirts and shifts by iron moulds that rot, By Blagden's wisdom lose each yellow spot! For this shall laundry virgins lift their voice; Napkins and damask table-cloths rejoice; Robins and caps, and sheets, and pillow cases, Lose their sad stains, and smile with lily faces. Lo! to improve of man the soaring mind, For sacred science, to his skin unkind, Did Doctor Blagden in an oven The doctor's body in the hot oven, with his nose projecting from the hole for air, would be no bad subject for the graver. bake, Brown as burnt coffee or a barley cake, Whilst down his nose projecting, sweat in rills Unsavoury flow'd like hartshorn streams from stills. SIR JOSEPH. Great duckweed Thompson Sir Benjamin, a second Linnæus., all my soul reveres! And Mulgrave charms me with his arctic bears. My eyes with shells, lo! limpet Davies greets! And Doctor Lettsom with his rare horse beets! Beets, that with shame our parsnips shall o'erwhelm, And fairly drive potatoes from the realm! Beets! in whose just applauses we are hoarse all; Such are the wondrous pow'rs of mangel worsal The more pompous name of the beet.. PETER. Beets that shall keep gaunt Famine to his east, And make him on Gentoos, as usual, feast; Whilst ev'ry lucky Briton that one meets, Shall strut a Falstaff, such the pow'r of beets! Beets, that must bring the Quaker wealth and fame, And give his cheek the virgin glow of shame; Who ne'er, meek man, was known a face to push, Nor hear his own applause without a blush! Beets, that shall form an epoch in our times, And thus by Peter prais'd, embalm his rhimes! SIR JOSEPH. Then, what of Aubert A silk merchant and F.R.S. who every Sunday, wet or dry, cloudy or sunshine, calm or windy, visits Greenwich, to catch the sun on the meridian—such is this gentleman's rage for the art, that he now has at Loampit-Hill, near Greenwich, 2000l. worth of astronomical instruments., think you, that great man, Whose broad eye deems creation scarce a span? PETER. Who weekly with his watch is seen to run, The little pupil of a Greenwich sun, To learn the motions of old Time, and mock The fatal errors of each London clock. Thus Lubin from his solitary down, Leads little Lubin to a neighb'ring town: The lad with ecstacy surveys the scene, Then home returning, with triumphant mien, Corrects his mother's, sister's conversations, And wonders at his ignorant relations. Aubert who meriteth, indeed, applause Full of high-sounding phrases, and wise saws; Who from his cradle learn'd the stars to lisp, And to a meteor One fortunate evening, as he was returning from his beloved observatory, a jack-a-lantern sprung up and played some tricks before the philosophical silk-man, whose optics being apt to magnify objects, converted it into an amazing meteor, with which the royal Journals soon after blazed. turn'd a will-o-whisp! SIR JOSEPH. Pray, then, what think ye of our famous Daines? PETER. Think of a man deny'd by nature brains! Whose trash so oft the royal leaves disgraces: Who knows not jordens brown from Roman vases! About old pots his head for ever puzzling, And boring earth, like pigs for truffles muzzling There are pigs kept expressly for hunting truffles in some parts of England.; Who likewise from old urns to crotchets leaps, Delights in music, and at concerts sleeps Such are the powers of somnolency over Mr. Daines Barrington,—at several of the Hanover-square concerts hath the Lyric Peter seen the antiquarian in seeming musical speculation, but verily employed in a most comfortable nap.. SIR JOSEPH. Zounds! 'tis in vain, I see, to utter praise! PETER. Then mention some one who deserves my lays. SIR JOSEPH. Know then, I've sent to distant parts to find Beings the most uncommon of their kind: The greatest monsters of the land and water— PETER. The beautiful deformities of nature! Birds without heads, and tails, and wings, and legs, Tremendous Cyclop pigs, and speckless eggs, Snails from Japan, and wasps, and Indian jays, Command attention, and excite our praise: Chopsticks and backscrapers are curious things; Scalps, and tobaccopipes, and Indian strings, Such, as to charm the wond'ring cits we see, Where Don Saltero At Chelsea. gives his Sunday tea; Great Don Saltero, name of high renown, Who treats too, with immortal rolls the town! Rare are the buttons of a Roman's breeches, In antiquarian eyes surpassing riches: Rare is each crack'd, black, rotten, earthen dish, That held of ancient Rome the flesh and fish: Rare are the talismans that drove the Devil, And rare the bottles that contain'd old snivel. Owls' heads, and snoring frogs, preserv'd in spirits, Most certainly are not without their merits; Yet these to gain, and give to public view, Lo! Parkinson knows full as well as you; As did Sir Ashton fam'd, whose mental pow'r Just reach'd to tell us by the clock the hour. SIR JOSEPH. Poh! p?x, don't laugh—such things are rich and scarce— Be something sacred—let not all be farce. PETER. Sir Joseph, I must laugh when things like these Beyond sublimities have pow'r to please: To crow'd with such-like littleness your walls, Is putting Master Punch into St. Paul's. Yet to the point—the place on which you dote Hath been for ever carried by the vote— Know then, your parasites begin to bellow, And call you openly a shallow fellow: In vain to fav'ring majesty you fly, Tis on the many that you must rely: E'en blockheads blush, so much are they asham'd— SIR JOSEPH. They and their modest blushes may be d?n'd. Ungrateful scoundrels! eat my rolls and butter, And daring thus their insolencies mutter! Swallow my turtle and my beef by pounds, And tear my venison like a pack of hounds; Yet have the impudence, the brazen face, To say I am not fitted for the place! In God's name let my wine in torrents flow; E'en be my house a tavern in Soho! Of daily venison let me try the force, And keep an open house for man and horse. Oh! let me hold by any means the chair!— To keep that honour every thing I dare. PETER. I own that nothing like good cheer succeeds— A man's a God whose hogshead freely bleeds; Champagne can consecrate the damned'st evil: A hungry parasite adores a devil; In radiant virtues his poor host arrays, And smooths him with the gossimer of praise; Stuff'd to the throat till repetition tires, And Gluttony's huge greasy wish expires; Apostate then, the knave denies his church, And leaves his saint, with laughter, in the lurch. In short, your gormandizers and your drinkers Quit their old faith, and turn out rank freethinkers. Dead is the novelty of fine fat haunches, And truth no longer sacrific'd to paunches: Asham'd, at length, the sad, repentant sinners All blush to barter flatt'ry for good dinners: No charms surround the knocker of your door, That beam'd with honour, but now beams no more! SIR JOSEPH. Betray'd by those on whom my all depends!— PETER. Betray'd, like Cæsar, by his bosom friends! SIR JOSEPH. Though man, ungrateful man, his aid deny; The Pow'r whose wisdom rules yon lofty sky, May grant his gracious and protecting pow'r, And aid my efforts in the trying hour! PETER. Left by your earthly friends, I fear your pray'rs, Most pious President, won't mend affairs: The Pow'r you mention, with all-seeing eyes, Well knows your little rev'rence for his skies The poet here most facetiously and beautifully alludes to the secession of the astronomical geniuses from the Society.. Thus may your pray'rs be vain, however hearty;— Besides, Heav'n oft'nest joins the strongest party. SIR JOSEPH. 'Sblood! have I practis'd ev'ry art in vain? Undaunted fac'd the dangers of the main?— PETER. And fac'd Queen Oborea in the boat, And lost your shoes and stockings, and your coat; A circumstance that much the tale enriches, But providentially preserv'd your breeches! For unknown weeds, dar'd unknown paths explore, And frighten'd Cannibals from shore to shore; On each new island clapp'd King George's seal, A sharp impression too of hardest steel; Whilst Witness Pistol and his brother Gun Look'd with a pointed approbation on. A decent method of appropriation, And adding glory to the British nation! True, you have try'd to be as great as he, The vent'rous Trojan, sport of wind and sea, Who left old Troy, his parish, far from home, To find a lodging for imperial Rome;— Yet are those feats what vulgars term a bore: Stale stuff—the members look for something more. I grant you naked with your servants pranc'd, To shew how folks at Otaheité danc'd; And much the smiling audience you amus'd, Though decency, indeed, the dance abus'd: She, blushing damsel, turn'd her head aside, And wish'd a whip to ev'ry hopping hide. Grant that you sent, to charm the public eye, Egyptian stones Sir Joseph sent some curious Egyptian stones to the British Museum; such was his zeal for the honour of hieroglyphics; but as that building possesses already as much of the antique as it can well authenticate, they were returned in a cart upon his hands., that form'd for hogs a stye; With seeming hieroglyphics on their faces, That prov'd unfortunately pigs'-feet traces: Yet, lo! like bullocks in a fair they roar, Or vacate bid you, or do something more. SIR JOSEPH. 'Sdeath, then, I'll spit in every blockhead's face; Kick them, and purge the dwelling from disgrace. PETER. Thus when a host of grasshoppers and rats, By men undaunted, unabash'd by cats, In hopping and in running legions pours, Affrights the papists, and their grass devours; Lo, arm'd with pray'rs to thunder in their ears, A bishop boldly meets the buccaneers; Sprinkles his holy water on the sod, And drives, and damns them, in the name of God This is actually done in Roman Catholic countries by order of the church. In some places two attorneys are employed in the affair of the grasshoppers; one for the grasshoppers, the other for the people: but it is the fate of the grasshoppers to have the worst of it, as they are always anathematized, and ordered to be excommunicated if they do not quit the place within a certain number of days.! You purge the tainted dwelling from disgrace, By boldly spitting in each member's face! Where, sweet Sir Joseph, will you find the spittle, Since what would float the Albion One of our first rates. were too little? With solemn, sentimental step, so slow, I see you through the streets of London go, With poring, studious, staring, earth-nail'd eye, As heedless of the mob that bustles by; This was a scheme of wisdom, let me say, But lo, this trap for fame hath had its day; And let me tell you, what I've urg'd before, The restless members look for something more. SIR JOSEPH. Zounds! ha'nt I swallow'd raw flesh like a hound? On vilest reptiles rung the changes round? Eat ev'ry filthy insect you can mention; Tarts made of grasshoppers, my own invention? Frogs; tadpoles by the spoonful, long-tail'd imps; And munch'd cockchaffers just like prawns or shrimps? PETER. In troth, I've seen you many a reptile eat, And heard you call the dirty dish a treat; Oft have I seen you meals on monkeys make; Nay, Hercules surpass—devour your snake; And make as little of a toad or viper, As pelicans of mack'rel or a piper; And wriggling round your mouth its little claws, Have heard a bat cry ‘Murder!’ in your jaws: Yet, hear, Sir Joseph, what I've said before, The blushing members look for something more. SIR JOSEPH. Hell seize the pack!—unconscionable dogs!— Snakes, spiders, beetles, chaffers, tadpoles, frogs, All swallow'd to display what man can do, And must the villains still have something new?— Tell, then, each pretty president creator, G?d d?mn him, that I'll eat an alligator! PETER. Sir Joseph, pray don't eat an alligator— Go swallow somewhat of a softer nature; Feast on the arts and sciences, and learn Sublimity from trifle to discern: With shells, and flies, and daisies, cover'd o'er, Let pert Queen Fiddlefaddle rule no more: Thus shall philosophy her suffrage yield, Sir Joseph wear his hat The president has the inestimable and sole privilege of sitting covered at the Royal Society's meeting.—The hammer forms a part of the regalia, to command silence, and rouse the members from their happy slumbers, whilst their secretary, Dr. Blagden, proclaims rare news from the moth, bat, butterfly, and spider countries., and hammer wield; No more shall Wisdom on the Journals stare, Nor Newton's The picture of this great man is immediately behind the chair of the president. image blush behind the chair. SIR JOSEPH BANKS AND THE EMPEROR OF MOROCCO, A TALE. Non omnia possumus omnes. One intellect not all things comprehends: The genius form'd for weeds, and grubs, and flies, Can't have for ever at its finger ends What's doing ev'ry moment in the skies. THE ARGUMENT. Peter the Great fighteth the President's Battle—proclaimeth some of the President's Powers—viz. his persevering Tooth and Nail Powers—his Stomach Powers—his Face Powers—his Hammer Powers, triumphing over the Powers of Morpheus, and eke his courageous Powers. Peter beginneth the Tale—Sir Joseph proceedeth to hunt—but first ejaculateth—The Virtuoso's Prayer—Sir Joseph's Insect Enthusiasm induceth him, contrary to his general Piety, to pray wickedly, by selfishly wishing to gratify his own Desires at the expense of the Farmers—Sir Joseph prayeth for Pharaoh's Flies—condemneth Pharaoh's Taste—maketh Interest for Showers of flies, instead of Quails—prayeth for Monsters, and promiseth them the Honour of his Name. Sir Joseph, in a Pointer-like Manner, ambulateth—he espieth the Emperor of Morocco—Peter conjectureth as to Sir Joseph's Joy on the Occasion —compareth Sir Joseph's Joy with that experienced by Archimedes, Hare-hunters, outrageously virtuous old Maids, the little Duke of Piccadilly, a Pimp, Mother Windsor's Virgins, and Mother Windsor herself—Sir Joseph's Pursuit—the President tumbleth, in imitation of Mr. Eden—a beautiful Comparison between Sir Joseph and Tamerlane, a Butterfly and Bajazet—Sir Joseph again tumbleth—Sir Joseph's Hat tumbleth with him—Sir Joseph riseth and bloweth—he is gazed at by a Countryman—he darteth through a Hedge in Pursuit of the Emperor, and tumbleth into a Lane—he getteth up speedily, and putteth a Question to Hob—Hob answereth not, but pitieth him—Sir Joseph obtaineth a second View of the Emperor—pursueth his Majesty into a Garden—oversetteth the Gardener—trampleth on rare Flowers—breaketh many Bell Glasses—overturneth the Scarecrow—Peter praiseth the Scarecrow—Sir Joseph oversetteth a Hive of Bees—The Bees surprised—they attempt a Revenge, but succeed not, on Account of the hard and tough Materials of Sir Joseph's Head-piece—The Gardener, quitting his horizontal Position, pursueth Sir Joseph—Sir Joseph pursueth the Emperor, and the Emperor flieth away—The Gardener collareth Sir Joseph, and expostulateth—Sir Joseph heedeth not the Gardener's Complaint, being in deep Sorrow for the Loss of the Emperor—The Gardener quitteth his Gripe in Sir Joseph, and putteth him down for a Lunatic—the Gardener execrateth Sir Joseph's Keeper, and falleth into a Panic—flieth off uncerimoniously, and leaveth the President in the Situation of a celebrated Prophet. PROEMIUM. PETRUS LOQUITUR. Since members lost to manners, growl; Call poor Sir Joseph ass, and owl; Nay, oft with coarser epithets revile; Though pitying much his pigmy merit. Let me display a Christian spirit, And try to lift a lame dog o'er a stile. Though not, like Erskine, in the law a giant, I must take up the cudgels for my client. Know by these presents, then, ye noisy crew, Who at his blushing honours Blushing honours—the author undoubtedly means the epithet blushing to be understood as synonymous with blooming, and not in a satirical sense: God forbid that the friend of Sir Joseph should mean otherwise! look so blue, That though Sir Joseph is not deep-discerning, And though, as all the world well knows, A nutshell might with perfect ease enclose Three quarters of his sense, and all his learning; Whose modest wisdom, therefore, never aims To find the longitude, or burn the Thames; Yet, as to things he sets himself about, With tooth and nail, like Hercules, so stout, He labours for his wish, no matter what;— I can't say that Sir Joseph lions kills; Hugs giants, or the blood of hydras spills; But then most manfully he eats a bat, Eats toads, or tough, or tender, old, or young, As in the sweetest strains the Muse hath sung See Peter's Prophecy.; Fit with the hugest Hottentot to cope, Who dines on raw flesh at the Cape of Hope. Blest with a phiz, he bids the members tremble! To deathlike silence turns the direst din; And where so many savages assemble, Like hounds they want a proper whipper-in. Dare members sleep Frequently, indeed, are the member's sent to the land of shadows by the society's somniferous papers; assisted in a great measure in their voyage by the doctor's drowsy manner of communicating the contents., a set of snoring Goths, Whilst Blagden reads a chapter upon moths? Down goes the hammer, cloth'd with thunder! Up spring the snorers, half without their wigs; Old graybeards grave, and smock-fac'd prigs, With ell-wide jaws displaying signs of wonder. Lo! perseverance is the soul of action! And courage proper to oppose a faction; Therefore he sits with wonderful propriety, The Monro of a mad society: And that he is both brave and persevering, Witness the following story, well worth hearing. A President, in butterflies profound, Of whom all insectmongers sing the praises, Went on a day to catch this game renown'd, On vi'lets, dunghills, nettletops and daisies! But first (so pious is Sir Joseph's nature) He thus address'd the butterfly's Creator. THE VIRTUOSO's PRAYER. ‘O thou whose wisdom plann'd the skies, And form'd the wings of butterflies, Attend my humble pray'r! Like Egypt, as in days of yore, Let earth with flies be cover'd o'er, And darken'd all the air. This, Lord, wou'd be the best of news— Then might thy servant pick and choose From such a glorious heap: Forth to the world I'd boldly rush, Put all Museums to the blush, And hold them all dog cheap. Pharaoh had not one grain of taste— The flies on him were thrown to waste, Nay, met with strong objection; But had thy servant, Lord, been there, I should have made, or much I err, A wonderful collection! O Lord! if not my mem'ry fails, Thou once didst rain on people quails— Again the world surprise; And 'stead of such a trifling bird, Rain on thy servant Joseph, Lord, Show'rs of rare butterflies! Since monsters are my great delight, With monsters charm thy servant's sight, Turn feathers into hair: Make legs where legs were never seen, And eyes, no bigger than a pin, As broad as saucers stare. The reptiles that are born with claws, O! let thy power supply with paws, Adorn'd with human nails; In value more to make them rise, Transplant from all their heads, their eyes, And place them in their tails. And if thou wisely wouldst contrive To make me butterflies alive, To fly without a head; To skim the hedges and the fields, Nay, eat the meat thy bouuty yields, Such wonders were indeed! Blagden should puff them at our meeting; Members would press around me greeting; The Journals swell with thanks; And more to magnify their fame, Those headless flies should have a name My name—Sir Joseph Banks!’ Thus having finish'd, forth Sir Joseph hies, Hope in his heart, and eagles in his eyes! Just like a pointer, quart'ring well his ground, He nimbly trots the field around! At length, to bless his hunting ambulation, Up rose a native of the flutt'ring nation. Broad star'd Sir Joseph as if struck by thunder (For much, indeed, are eyes enlarg'd by wonder), When from a dab of dung, or some such thing, An Emp'ror of Morocco rear'd his wing! Not Archimedes, 'tis my firm belief, More blest, cried ‘eureka, I've nabb'd the thief;’ Nor hunters, when a hare, to shun foul play, Steals from his seat so sly, cry ‘Stole away;’ Nor stale old nymphs, by raging virtue sway'd, Roar on a frail one, ‘Kill the wicked jade;’ Than roar'd Sir Joseph on the verdant sod, ‘Morocco's Emp'ror, by the living God!’ Not with more joy, nor rapture-speaking look, The little gamesome Piccadilly duke Eyes a nice tit, fresh launch'd upon the town; Nor with more pleasure Cupid's trusty crimp, By mouths of vulgar people nam'd a pimp, Stares on his virtuous fee, a crown; Nor King's-Place nymphs, on greenhorns in their pow'r; Who (shameless rascals, wanting not a wife) Hire love, like hackney-coaches, by the hour, Damning the love so true that lasts for life; Nor wither'd Windsor on the simple maid, From scenes of rural innocence betray'd; Forc'd to dispose of Nature's sweetest charms; Doom'd for a meal to sink a beauteous wreck; To lend to man she loathes, her lip, her neck, And, weeping, act the wanton in his arms; Than did the hero of my song, Survey the emp'ror as he mov'd along. Not with more glee a hen-peck'd husband spies Death shutting up his wife's two cat-like eyes, Accustom'd on him oft and fierce to roll; Just like a galley slave, poor fellow, treated, Or those poor English at Calcutta sweated; Stuff'd in the old Black Hole: And yet, a neater simile to use, Not with more true delight a lover views The blushing orient leading on the day That gives a blooming partner to his arms, In virtues rich, and rich in youthful charms, To bid the hours with rapture glide away: Sad anxious swain, who now in bed, now out, Toss'd like the sea with thund'ring thoughts about Cursing with hearty pray'rs the lingering night; Now trying hard to sleep away the time; Now staring on the dark, like bards for rhime, To catch the smallest glimpse of light. Afraid that Phœbus means foul play, And bent to spite him, lie a-bed all day: And, bonâ fide, not of rapture fuller, Thurlow, the seal and royal conscience keeper, Sees his prime fav'rite, Mr. Justice Buller, High thron'd in Chancery, grieve the poor Sir Pepper, Than did the president so keen espy The butterfly! Lightly with winnowing wing amid the land, His Moorish majesty in circles flew! With sturdy striding legs and outstretch'd hand, The virtuoso did his prey pursue. He strikes—he misses—strikes again—he grins, And sees in thought the monarch fix'd with pins; Sees him on paper giving up the ghost, Nail'd like a hawk or martyr to a post. Oft fell Sir Joseph on the slipp'ry plain, Like patriot Eden—fell to rise again; The emp'ror smiling, sported on before; Like Phœbus coursing Daphne was the chace, But not so was the meaning of the race, Sir Joseph ran to kill, not kiss the Moor; To hold him pris'ner in a glass for show, Like Tamerlane (redoubtable his rage), Who kept poor Bajazet, his vanquish'd foe, Just like an owl or magpie in a cage. Again to earth Sir Joseph fell so flat, Flat as the flattest of the flounder race! Down with Sir Joseph dropp'd his three-cock'd hat, Most nobly sharing in his friend's disgrace. Again he springs, with hope and ardour pale, And blowing like the fish baptiz'd a whale; Darting his arms now here, now there, so wild, With all the eager raptures of a child, Who with broad anxious eye a bauble views, And, capering legs and hands, the toy pursues. A countryman, who, from a lane, Had mark'd Sir Joseph, running, tumbling, sweating, Stretching his hands and arms, like one insane, And with those arms the air around him beating, To no particular opinion leaning, Of such manœuvring could not guess the meaning. At length the President, all foam and muck, Quite out of breath, and out of luck, Pursued the flying monarch to the place, Where stood this countryman, with marv'ling face. Now through the hedge, exactly like a horse, Wild plung'd the President with all his force, His brow in sweat, his soul in perturbation; Mindless of trees, and bushes, and the brambles, Head over heels into the lane he scrambles, Where Hob stood lost in wide-mouth'd speculation! ‘Speak,’ roar'd the President, ‘this instant—say, Hast seen, hast seen, my lad, this way The Emp'ror of Morocco pass?’— Hob to the insect-hunter nought replied, But shook his head, and sympathizing sigh'd, ‘Alas! Poor gentleman, I'm sorry for ye; And pity much your upper story!’ Lo! down the lane alert the emp'ror flew, And struck once more Sir Joseph's hawk-like view; And now he mounted o'er a garden wall! In rush'd Sir Joseph at the garden door, Knock'd down the gard'ner—what could man do more? And left him as he chose to rise or sprawl. O'er peerless hyacinths our hero rush'd; Through tulips and anemonies he push'd, Breaking a hundred necks at ev'ry spring: On bright carnations, blushing on their banks, With desp'rate hoof he trod, and mow'd down ranks, Such vast ambition urg'd to seize the king! Bell glasses, all so thick, were tumbled o'er, And, lo! the cries, so shrill, of many a score, A sad and fatal stroke proclaim'd; The scarecrow all so red, was overturn'd; His vanish'd hat, and wig, and head, he mourn'd, And much, indeed, the man of straw was maim'd! Just guardian of the sacred spot, With face so fierce, and pointed gun, Who threaten'd all the birds with shot; To kill of sparrows ev'ry mother's son: Fierce as those scarlet ministers of fate, The warlike guardians of St. James's gate! Yet not content with feats like these, He tumbled o'er a hive of bees; Out rush'd the host, and wonder'd from their souls, What dev'l dar'd dash their house about their polls. Like Louis Louis XIV, whose fierce heart was such, As made him like a football kick the Dutch! But soon the small, heroic, injur'd nation Descry'd the author of their obligation; And, to repay it, round him rush'd the swarm; Prodigious was the buz about his ears! With all their venom did they push their spears, But, lo! they work'd him not one grain of harm! Yet did no god nor godling intervene, By way of screen! The happy head their pointed spears defied, Strong, like old Homer's shields, in tough bull hide, And brass well temper'd, to support the shock!— The bees their disappointed vengeance mourn'd, And from their fierce attack, fatigu'd, return'd, Believing they had storm'd a barber's block. What was thought death and tortures by the clan, Was only tickling the great man! Thus round big Ajax rag'd the Trojan host, Who might as well, indeed, have drubb'd a post. The gard'ner now for just revenge up sprung, O'erwhelm'd with wonderment and dung, And fiercely in his turn pursu'd the knight! From bed to bed, full tilt the champions rac'd, This chas'd the knight, the knight the emp'ror chas'd, Who scal'd the walls, alas! and vanish'd out of sight: To find the empress, p'rhaps, and tell her grace The merry hist'ry of the chase. At length the gard'ner, swell'd with rage and dolour, O'ertaking, grasps Sir Joseph by the collar, And blest with fav'rite oaths, abundance show'rs: ‘Villain,’ he cry'd, ‘beyond example! Just like a cart-horse on my beds to trample, More than your soul is worth, to kill my flow'rs! See how your two vile hoofs have made a wreck— Look, rascal, at each beauty's broken neck!’— Mindless of humbled flow'rs, so freely kill'd, Although superior to his soul declar'd, And vegetable blood profusely spill'd, Superior, too, to all reward; Mindless of all the gard'ner's plaintive strains, The emp'rors form monopoliz'd his brains. At length he spoke, in sad despairing tones, ‘Gone! by the God that made me!—D?mn his bones! O Lord! no disappointment mine surpasses;— Poh! what are paltry flowers and broken glasses, A tumbled scarecrow, bees, the idle whim?— Zounds! what a set of miscreants to him! ‘Gone is my soul's desire, for ever gone!’— ‘Who's gone?’ the gard'ner straight reply'd— ‘The emp'ror, sir,’ with tears, Sir Joseph cry'd— ‘The emp'ror of Morocco—thought my own! To unknown fields behold the monarch fly!— Zounds! not to catch him, what an ass was I!’ His eyes the gard'ner, full of horror, stretch'd, And then a groan, a monstrous groan, he fetch'd, Contemplating around his ruin'd wares; And now he let Sir Joseph's collar go; And now he bray'd aloud with bitterest woe, ‘Mad! madder than the maddest of March hares! A p?x confound the fellow's Bedlam rigs! Oh! he hath done the work of fifty pigs! The devil take his keeper, a damn'd goose, For letting his wild beast get loose!’ But now the gard'ner, terrified, began To think himself too near a man In so Peg-Nicholson a situation; And happy from a madman to escape, He left him without bow, or nod, or scrape, Like Jeremiah 'midst his lamentation. Such is the tale—if readers sigh for more, Sir Joseph's wallet holdeth many a score. A POETICAL EPISTLE TO A FALLING MINISTER; ALSO AN IMITATION OF THE TWELFTH ODE OF HORACE. ? Hunc tu Romane caveto Hic niger est ? EPISTLE TO A FALLING MINISTER. Blind to an artful boy's insidious wiles, Why rests the genius of the Queen of Isles?— Whilst Liberty in irons sounds th' alarm, Why hangs suspense on Virtue's coward arm?— Whilst Tyranny prepares her jails and thongs, Why sleeps the sword of Justice o'er our wrongs?— Oh! meanly founding on a father's fame, To Britain's highest seat a daring claim; Oh! if thy face one blush could ever boast, And that lorn sign of virtue be not lost; Now on thy visage let the stranger burn, And glow for deeds that bid an empire mourn. Drawn from a garret by the royal sire, Warm'd like the viper by his friendly fire, What hath thy gratitude sublimely done?— Fix'd, like the snake, thy fang upon the son! Yes—thou most gen'rous youth, thy hostile art Hath lodg'd a pois'nous shaft in Britain's heart! Thy arm hath dragg'd the column to the ground, The sacred wonder of the realms around! To make snug, comfortable habitations For thee and all thy pitiful relations. Barbarian-like—how like those sons of spoil, Whose impious hands on hallow'd structures toil— Base throng, that through Palmyra's temple digs, To form a lodging for themselves and pigs! Oh! if ambition prompts thy soaring soul To live the theme of future times with R?lle; Thrice happy youth, like his shall shine thy name, Who gave th' Ephesian wonder to the flame! Sick at the name of R? (to thee though dear), The name abhorr'd by Honour's shrinking ear, I draw reluctant from thy venal throng, And give it mention, though it blasts my song. How cou'dst thou bid that R?lle, despis'd by all, On helpless beauty like a mastiff fall; Then meanly to correct the brute pretend, And claim the merit of the fair one's friend A most wanton and illiberal attack made by this man on Mrs. F?h?t in the House of Commons, exceeds all precedent.? Art thou the youth on whom the virtues smile? The boasted saviour of our sinking isle? O'er such, Oblivion, be thy wing display'd! Oh! waft them from the gibbet to thy shade! Yet what expect from thee, whose icy breast, A stranger to their charm, the Loves detest?— Thee, o'er whose heart their fascinating pow'r Ne'er knew the triumph of one soft'ned hour? To give thy flinty soul the tender sigh, Vain is the radiance of the brightest eye! In vain for thee of beauty blooms the rose: In vain the swelling bosom spreads its snows— A Joseph thou, against the sex to strive— Dead to those charms that keep the world alive! In vain thy malice pours its frothy tide— In vain the virtues of thy prince to hide— Thou and thy imps, to dim his rising ray, Urge clouds on clouds to thwart the golden day! Mad toil!—I see his orb superior pass, That smiles triumphant on the sable mass. O ?! a sister kingdom damns thy deeds, And pities hapless Britain as she bleeds. Hibernia scorns each meanly treach'rous art Hatch'd by the base r?b?n of thy heart, That crawls an aspic bloated black with fate, To pour a dire contagion through the state. She, with an honest voice, her prince approves, And nobly trusts the virtues that she loves; Detests a hangman's unremitting toil, To break upon the wheel a happy isle; Who yet to push the guilt and folly further, Suborns addresses to applaud the murther! Who but must laugh to see thy boasted friends, On whose poor rotten trunks thy all depends! See Bute's mean parasite, thy spaniel, creep, Whose Argus' eyes of av'rice never sleep; A close state leech, who, sticking to the nation, As adders deaf to Honour's execration, Sucks from its throat the blood by night, by day, Nor till the state expires will drop away. Yet see another fiend, with scowling eye, Who draws from Nature's soul her deepest sigh; Asham'd her hand should usher into light What fate should whelm with everlasting night! Lost by his arts, behold the beauteous maid The melancholy circumstance alluded to here, the family of Dr. Lynch, of Canterbury, can best explain., Whom Innocence herself could ne'er upbraid, Sunk a pale victim to the gaping tomb, Whilst all but he with grief survey'd her doom; Whose heart disdain'd to feel—whose eye severe, Compassion never melted with a tear! Yet left in silence to himself alone, Aghast he heaves the conscience-wounded groan! At ev'ry sound how horror heaves the sigh! How dangers thicken on his straining eye! He sees her phantom, form'd by treach'rous love, Droop in the grot, and pine amid the grove: He marks her mien of woe, her cheek so pale, And trembles at her shrieks that pierce the gale! At night's deep noon what fears his soul invade! How wild he starts amidst the spectr'd shade! And dreading ev'ry hopeless hour the last, He hears the call of Death in ev'ry blast! Such are thy colleagues We must not forget, however, Messieurs their graces of R. and G., Harry D., cum plurimis aliis, though they have not the honour of being mentioned in our poetical calendar., O thou patriot boy! Whose heads and hearts thy virtues dare employ; Who, crouching at thy heels, like bloodhounds wait To fasten on the vitals of the state! Such are the miscreants who would rule the realm! Such the black pirates that would seize the helm! Had not I known thee, ?????, the Muse had sworn, That, blest to see the state to atoms torn, Hell with her host had drawn each damned plan, And for the murder nurs'd thy dark divan. Speak—hath thy heart with mad ambition fir'd, Like Cromwell's, hot for pow'r, to thrones aspir'd? Then may that young, old trait'rous bosom feel The rapid vengeance of some virtuous steel; Or, what to bosoms not quite flint, is worse, May Heav'n with hoary age a rebel curse— From sweet society behold him torn, Condemn'd, like Cain, to walk the world forlorn. Thus rous'd to anger for my country's wrong, The Muse for vengeance panting pour'd her song— But, ah! in vain I wish'd the blessing mine, To plant a scorpion's sting in ev'ry line. Now Prudence gently pull'd the poet's ear, And thus the daughter of the blue-ey'd maid Minerva., In flatt'ry's soothing sounds, divinely said, ‘O Peter! eldest born of Phœbus, hear— Whose verse could ravish kings, relax the claw Of that gaunt, hungry savage christen'd law— Indeed thou wantest worldly wisdom, Peter, To mix a little oft'ner with thy metre— Lo! if thine eye Dame Fortune's smile pursues, To oily adulation prompt the Muse. Give for the future all thy rhimes to praise; Strike to the glorious Pitt thy sounding lyre— Thy head may then be crown'd with Warton's bays, And mutton twirl with spirit at the fire.’ ‘Prudence,’ quoth I, ‘indeed—indeed I can't— Don't ask me to turn rogue and sycophant!’ Now with a smile, first cousin to a grin, Dame Prudence answer'd, bridling up her chin— ‘Sweet, harmless, pretty, conscientious pigeon! Ah! Peter, well I ween thou art not rich— Know that thou'lt die like beggars in a ditch— Know, too, that hunger is of no religion. Sit down and make a Horace imitation, Like Pope, and let the stanza glow With praise of Messieurs Pitt and Co., The present worthy rulers of the nation.’ With purs'd-up, puritanic mouth so prim, Thus spoke Dame Prudence to the bard of whim; Who, with politeness seldom running o'er, For inspiration scratch'd his tuneful sconce, To please Dame Oracle, for once— A dame, some say, he never saw before. IMITATION OF HORACE. (ODE XII. BOOK I.) ON MESSIEURS PITT AND CO. Muse, having dropp'd Sir Joseph and the king, What sort of gentry shall we deign to sing? What high and mighty name that all adore? What ministerial wight that bribes each cit, Wolf-like to howl for homage to King Pitt, And set each smoky ale-house in a roar; That sends to counties, borough-towns, his crimps, Alias his vote-seducing pimps, To bribe the mob with brandy, beer, and song, To put their greasy fists to court addresses, Full of professions kind, and sweet caresses, And with a fiddle lead the logs along. Shall Dornford, king of wine, and mum, and perry, Be crown'd with lyric bays, with Master Merry; Two sages who, in diff'rent places born, Chick Lane and Black-boy Alley did adorn? Or, Muse, suppose we sing King Pitt himself, The greatest man on earth—a cunning elf, Who driveth, Jehu-like, the church and state: And, next to royal Pitt, we'll sing the dame, Of open, gen'rous, charitable fame, Lamenting sad a monarch's hapless fate; Who, though transfix'd by sorrow's dart so cruel, So prudent, numbers each bank-note and jewel? Nor shall we by old Bacchus Weymouth pass, A jolly fellow o'er his glass— Nor, Swellenberg, shalt thou a shrimp appear, Whose palate loves a dainty dish, Whose teeth in combat shine with flesh and fish, Whose Strelitz stomach holds a butt of beer; Who soon shalt keep a saleshop for good places, For which so oft the people squabble, From gaping cobblers to their gaping graces, And thus provide for great and little rabble. I'll sing how calmly C??????n takes the bit, And trots so mildly under Master Pitt; And Th??????w, too, whom none but Pitt could tame, Who, blest with Master Billy's finest saddle, No longer makes our brains with neighing addle, No longer now Job's war-horse snorting flame; But that slow brute whom few or none revere, Fam'd for his fine base voice and length of ear; Yet now so gentle you may smooth his nose— Poor Ch???c?llor The name of the horse. will make no riot— Calm in his stall his aged limbs repose, And pleas'd he eats his oats and hay in quiet! This pair, so tame, amid the courtier throng, Shall drag their Master William's coach along, And raise the wonder of the million; Just like two bull-dogs in a country town, That gallop in their harness up and down, With Monsieur Monkey for postillion. We'll sing the brothers of our loving queen, Fine, hungry, hearty youths as e'er were seen; Who, if once try'd, would shine, I make no doubt; And chiefly he who merits high rewards, Who, wriggling to the Hanoverian guards, Kept the poor Prince of Brunswick out, Although so brave a prince, and spilt his blood So freely for the king of England's This is scarcely credible, but it is nevertheless true.—The Prince of Brunswick's genius was forced to yield to the superior one of the Queen's brother! good. We'll sing, too, Master R?lle, who, fond of fame, High-daring, from the land of dumplings came, To bear the minister—to be his ass— Like Conj'ror Balaam's reas'ning brute, That carry'd Balaam, Balak to salute, And curse the Israelites, alas! And, lo! as did the Lord— Who op'd the mouth of Balaam's beast: So hath our Lord, 'Squire Pitt, upon my word, Op'd Master R?lle's, to give the house a feast! Yet, hang it, Dev'nshire is by Aram Balaam's country seat. beat— A circumstance that wrings the poet's soul— For Balaam's jackass made a speech quite neat, Which never yet was done by Pitt's poor R????? Or shall I sing old Cornwall's death, Or fierce Sir Bullface, who resign'd his breath With brother Cornwall in the self-same year— A downright bear! Who bade a monarch, like a boy at school, Not spend his money like a f???l? We too might sing the king of swine, Sir Joseph! peerless in the fatt'ning line. We too may Brudenell sing, who, some time since, Admir'd and lov'd, ador'd and prais'd his prince; Follow'd him, spaniel-like, about; Swore himself black, poor fellow, in the face, That he would ten times rather lose his place Than leave him—Thus said he with phiz devout: But when it came to pass his highness try'd him, This false apostle, Peter-like, deny'd him! We'll sing Lord Galloway, a man of note, Who turn'd his tailor, much enraged, away, Because he stitch'd a star upon his coat So small, it scarcely threw a ray— Whereas he wish'd a planet huge to flame, To put the moon's full orb to shame— He wanted one so large, with rays so thick, As to eclipse the star of Sir John Dick! Sir John, who got his star, so bright and stout, For making super-excellent sour krout This honour of the star was really conferred on him by the Empress of Russia, for furnishing the Russian fleet, in the Mediterranean, with the above cabbage manufacture, to sharpen their courage for a massacre of the poor Turks.. Or, Muse, suppose we sing the Sp?ker's wig, In which, 'tis said, a world of wisdom lies; Which, to a headpiece scarcely worth a fig, Importance gives, that greatly doth surprise, When through the chaos of the house he bawls For order that oft flies St. Stephen's walls; Driv'n by a host of scrapes, and hawks, and hums, And blowing noses, that distract her drums. For, Muse, we can't well sing poor Gr?lle's head, Because it wanteth eyes—imperfect creature! Again—its lining happ'neth to be lead— Such are the whimsicalities of nature: And thus this speaking headpiece is, no doubt, As dark within as certés 'tis without! Yet was this youth proclaim'd a pretty sprig, A very promising, a thriving twig, That by his parents dear was said would be, In time, a very comely tree, And what those parents dear would also suit, Produce enormous quantities of fruit, By God's good grace, and much good looking after— A thought that now convulseth us with laughter! Suppose we chaunt old Willis and his whip, At which the human hide revolts; Who bids, like grasshoppers, his pupils skip, And breaks mad gentlemen like colts; Or trains them, like a pointer, to his hand— And such the mighty conjuror's command, He, by the magic of sticks, ropes, and eyes, Commands wild folly to be tame and wise. Or grant we throw away a verse or two Upon the bedchamber's most idle imps— Those lords of gingerbread—a gaudy crew, Sticking together just like social shrimps; Regardless who the state coach drives, So they may lead good, merry, lazy lives; Pleas'd e'en from devils to receive their pay, So they, like moths, may flutter life away! Pitt shall the House of Commons rule, And eke of poor incurables the school; And pour on such the vengeance of his spleen As meanly think of Hastings and the ?! On di'monds Pitt and Co. shall largely feast, Knock down the nabobs, and exhaust the East! O lady! whose great wisdom thinketh fit To spread thy petticoat o'er William Pitt! This William Pitt and thou, without a joke, Will turn out most extraordinary folk; Pitt and the petticoat shall rule together, Each with the other vastly taken; Make, when they choose, or fair or filthy weather, And cut up kingdoms just like bacon! Thus having finish'd, Prudence with a stare, Exclaim'd, ‘Rank irony—thou wicked poet,’— Quoth I, ‘My little Presbyterian fair, I know it.’ ‘Ah!’ quoth the dame again, with lifted eyes, ‘When will this stupid world be wise?’ ‘Ah! had the prince his proper int'rest felt, And like Bucephalus, the famous, knelt To take Pitt Alexander on his back, He might have ambled prettily along, And very rarely felt his rider's thong— Just now and then a gentle smack, T'inform his royal colt what being rode him, And with such dignity bestrode him. Yes—had his highness but vouchshaf'd to stoop, With heav'n born Pitt he might have eat his soup, Joy'd in the full possession of his wishes, And with his servant shar'd the loaves and fishes!’ END OF VOL.

THE rage for historical pictures in this kingdom, so nobly rewarded by Messrs. Boydell and Macklin, hath, with the great encouragement of two or three of the principal Muses, tempted me to offer subjects to the labourers in the graphic vineyard. When Shakespeare and Milton are exhausted, I may presume that the following Odes, Tales, and Hints, in preference to the labours of any other of our British Bards, may be adopted by the brush of genius.— Had I not thus stepped forward as the champion of my own merit, which is deemed so necessary now a-days for the obtension of public notice, not only b authors, but by têtemakers, persumers, elastic truss, and parliament speech-makers, &amp;c. who in the daily newspapers, are the heralds of their own splendid abilities, I might possibly be passed by without observation, and thus a great part of poetical immortality be sacrificed to a pitiful mauvaise honte. SUBJECTS FOR PAINTERS. Scene—the Royal Academy. Peace and good will to this fair meeting!— I come not with hostility, but greeting— Not eagle-like to scream, but dove-like coo it— I come not with the sword of vengeance, rhime, To slash, and act as journeyman to Time— The God himself is just arriv'd to do it. To make each feeble figure a poor corse, I come not with the shafts of satire sporting Then view me not like Stubbs's staring horse, With terror on the approaching lion snorting: I come to bid the hatchet's labour cease, And smoke with friends the calumet of peace. Knight of the polar star, or bear, don't start, And like some long-ear'd creatures, bray, ‘what art?’ Sir William, shut your ell-wide mouth of terror— I come not here, believe me, to complain Of such as dar'd employ thy building brain, And criticise an œconomic error A large portion of the Royal Academy, raised at an extraordinary expense, fell to the ground lately; but as the knight is a favourite at court, no harm is done. The nation is able to rear it again, which will be a benefit ticket in Sir William's way.. I come not here to call thee knave or fool, And bid thee seek again Palladio's school; Or copy heav'n, who form'd thy head so thick, To give stability to stone and brick; No—'twould be cruel now to make a rout— The very stones already have cry'd out. I come not here, indeed, new cracks to spy, And call thee for the workmanship hard names; To point which wing shall next forsake the sky, And tumble in the Strand, or in the Thames. Nor come I here to cover thee with shame, For putting clever Academic men Sir William actually gave orders for the nonadmission of the Royal Academicians into the academy, to see the royal procession to St. Paul's, as he had some women and children of his acquaintance who wished to see the show. Half a dozen boards were; consequently ordered to be put together on the outside of the building for their reception., Like calves or pigs, into a pen, To see the king of England and his dame, 'Midst carts and coaches, golden horse and foot; 'Midst peopled windows, chimneys and old walls; 'Midst marrowbones and cleavers, fife and flute, Passing in pious pilgrimage to Paul's; Where, as the show of gingerbread went by, The rain, as if in mockery from the sky. Dribbled on ev'ry academic nob, And wash'd each pigtail smart, and powder'd bob: Wash'd many a visage, black, and brown, and fair, Giving to each so picturesque an air; Resembling that of drooping, rain-soak'd fowls, Or, what's a better picture, parboil'd owls; Whilst thou, great Jove upon Olympus aping, Didst sit majestic, from a window gaping. O, West! that fix'd and jealous eye forbear, Which scowling marks the bard with doubt and fear; Thy forms are sacred from my wrath divine; 'Twere cruel to attack such crippled creatures, So very, very feeble in their natures, Already gasping in a deep decline! I seek them not with scalping thoughts, indeed, Too great my soul to bid the figures bleed: No—peace and happiness attend 'em; Where'er they go, poor imps, God mend 'em. I come not to impart to thee the crime Of over dealing in the true sublime; I scorn with malice thus thy fame to wound; Nor cruel to declare, and hurt thy trade, That too divine effects of light and shade Were ever 'midst thy labours to be sound. Nor swear to blast an atom of thy merit, That elegance, expression, spirit, Too strongly from the canvass blaze; And damn thee thus with Raphael's praise: Besides, against the stream I scorn to rush; The world ne'er said, nor thought it of thy brush. Were I to write thy epitaph, I'd say, ‘Here lies below a painter's clay, Who work'd away most furiously for kings, And prov'd that fire of inclination, For pleasing the great ruler of a nation, And fire of genius, are two different things.’ Nor come I here t'inform some men so wise, Who shine not yet upon the R. A. list, That limbs in spasms and crack'd and goggling eyes, With grandeur cannot well exist. Nay, let it be recorded in my rhime, Convulsions cannot give the true sublime. St. Vitus might be virtuous to romance— Peace to the manes of that capering saint; Yet let me tell the sons of paint, Sublimity adorneth not his dance. Wide saucer eyes, and dire distortion, Will only make a good abortion. No, landscape painters, let your gold streams sleep— Sleep, golden skies and bulls, and golden cows, And golden groves and vales, and golden sheep, And golden goats, the golden grass that brouse, Which with such golden lustre flame, As beat the very golden frame. Peace to the scenes of Birmingham's bright school! Peace to the brighter scenes of Pontypool! Aw'd I approach, ye sov'reigns of the brush, With modesty's companion sweet, a blush, And hesitation nat'ral to her tongue: And eye so diffident, with beam so mild, Like Eve's when Adam on her beauties smil'd, And led her blushing, nothing loath, along, To give the lady a green gown so sweet, On beds of roses, love's delicious seat. Yes, sober, trembling, Quaker-like, I come To this great dome To offer subjects to the sons of paint; Accept the pleasant tales and hints I bring, Of knight and lord, and commoner and king, Sweeter than hist'ry of embowell'd saint: Or martyr beat like Shrovetide cocks with bats, And fir'd like turpentin'd poor roasting rats. Inimical as dogs to pigs, Or wind and rain to powder'd wigs, Or mud from kennels to a milk-white stocking; Hostile to Peter's phiz as if a pest, Why springs the man of hist'ry, Master West, And cries, ‘Off, off! your tales and hints are shocking; Inventions—fabrications—lies—damn'd lies; Kings, and the world besides, thy spite despise! ‘Sir, you're a liar, ev'ry body knows it; Sir, every stupid stanza shows it; Sir, you know nothing of a king and queen; In spheres too high their orbs superior roll By thy poor little grov'lling, mole-ey'd soul, Thou outcast of Parnassus! to be seen. ‘Sir, they do honour to their god-like station, The two first luminaries of the nation, So meek, good, gen'rous, virtuous, humble, wise; Whilst thou a savage, a great fool so fat, Curs'd with a conscience blacker than my hat, Art rival to that fiend the prince of lies. ‘Go, pour thy venom on my Lear A pretty iron-staring sketch now in the exhibition,— A whisper, Hopkins, Sternhold, in thy ear: King Lear, to mortify thee, goes Where majesty delights with West to prate, Much more than ministers of state, Where thou shalt never show thy nose! ‘Where pages fancy it a heinous crime, Thou foul-mouth'd fellow, to repeat thy rhime; Where ev'ry cook, it is my firm belief, Would nobly make it a religious point, Rather than put thy trash upon a joint, To let the fire consuming burn the beef. ‘There's not a shopkeeper in Windsor town That would not hang thee, shoot thee, stab thee, drown, That doth not damn thy stuff, thy odes and tales; That doth not think thy odes would give disease To ev'ry thing they wrapp'd—to bread, to cheese, Nay, give contagion to a bag of nails. ‘The very Windsor dogs and cats, The very Windsor owls and bats, Would howl and squall, and hoot, and shriek to meet, Like thee a raggamuffin in the street. ‘The servant maids of Windsor from each shop, Some pointing brooms, and some a scornful mop, Their loyal sentiments would disembogue, And taunting cry, “there goes a lying rogue.” ‘Behold rank impudence thy rhimes inspire; Consummate insolence thy verse provoke! Fool! to believe thy muse a muse of fire,— A chimney-sweeper's drab, a muse of smoke. ‘The very bellman's rhimes possess more merit; Nay, Nichols' magazine exceeds in spirit: A printer's devil with conceit so drunk, Who publishes for gentleman and trunk; ‘Who sets up author on old Bowyer's scraps; Bowyer, whose pen recorded all the raps That hungry authors gave to Bowyer's door, To swell the curious literary store: ‘Who on a purblind antiquarian's back, A founder'd, broken-winded hack, Rides out to find old farthings, nails, and bones— On darkest coins the brightest legend reads, On traceless copper sees imperial heads, And makes inscriptions older than the stones. ‘Too bids, to give his customers surprise, A Druid altar from a pigsty rise. Yes, Nichols, aping wisdom through his glasses, Thee, thee Apollo's scavenger, surpasses. ‘Soon shall we see the Fleet thy carcase wring, Mean thro' the prison grate for farthings angling, Suspending feet of stockings by a string, Or glove or nightcap for our bounty dangling: ‘Whilst issuing from thy mouth begrim'd with beard (Thy pale nose poking through thy prison hole), The hollow voice of mis'ry will be heard, “Kind ge'mman, pity a poor hungry soul; Have pity on a pris'ner's case so shocking— Good lady, put a farthing in the stocking!’ ‘What impudence, thus bold a face to push, Arm'd with a winking light of paltry rush, As if with truth's bright torch, into our room! To dart on ignorance the fancied rays— To bid of barbarism the empire blaze, And kind illumine error's midnight gloom. ‘Get out, and pertly don't come troubling me; A dog is better company than thee.’ I thank ye—much oblig'd t'ye, Master West, For thoughts so kind, and prettily exprest Yet won't I be refused, I won't, indeed; You must, you shall have tale, and ode, and hint; This memory of mine contains a mint; And thus, in bold defiance, I proceed. Yet mind me,—as to our bright king and queen, Their names are sacred from the poet's spleen— Peace to their reign! they feel no more my jokes, Whether to Hanover they wisely roam, Or full as wisely count their cash at home, My satire shall not hurt the gentlefolks. Pleas'd in a hut to broil my mutton bone, I sigh not for the ven'son of a throne: Nay, slavery doth not with my pride agree; A toad eater's an imp I don't admire; Nor royal small-talk doth my soul desire— I've seen my sovereigns—that's enough for me. A thousand themes for canvass I could name, To give the artist beef and fame: Lo! Hodsell in his country seat so fine, Where, 'midst his tulips, grin stone apes with parrots, Where Neptune foams along a bed of carrots, Instead of cleaving through his native brine. Where Phœbus strikes to cabbages his strings, Where love o'er garlic waves his purple wings, Where Mars to vanquish beets heroic leans: And, arm'd with lightnings, with terrific eyes, The great and mighty Ruler of the skies, Sublimely thunders through a bed of beans; Close by whose side the haymakers are mating, And Dutchmen to their knees in onions skaiting. A mighty warrior, in the House of Lords, Swallowing, alas! a bitter, bitter pill; Eating, poor man, his own sad words, Exceedingly against his noble will; Whilst Rawdon by his side, with martial face, Commandeth him to swallow with a grace; Would make an interesting scene, indeed, And show the courage of King Charles's breed! How like a doctor, forcing down the throat Of some poor puling child a dose of salts, At which its little soul revolts, With wriggling limbs, wry mouths, and piteous note; Yet forc'd to take the formidable purge, Or taste a bitt'rer dose, the threat'ned scourge! Or Richmond The duke absolutely ordered cannon to be made of leather, from a snuff-box maker, which, at Woolwich, on Saturday the second day of May, 1789, were seriously tried, and, like many a nobleman, found too soft., watchful of the state's salvation, Sprinkling his ravelins o'er the nation; Now buying leathern boxes up by tons, Improving thus the nature of great guns; Guns blest with double natures, mild and rough, To give a broadside, or a pinch of snuff. Or Richmond At Portsmouth his grace, not long since, bespoke a dinner for a few friends; and because no impression had been made on a roasted duck, Charles Lenox, Duke of Richmond, Earl of March, Master General of the Ordnance, Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the County of Sussex, Duke of Lenox in Scotland, and Aubigny in France, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, &amp;c., thought it a grievous imposition, and consequently ordered the landlord of the inn to deduct the eighteen pence, the price of the duck, from the bill, which was done accordingly. at the enormous reck'ning struck, At Portsmouth battling hard about a duck. A certain high and mighty duchess, Hugging her husband in her cat-like clutches, Biting and tearing him with brandy zeal; Whose flax in heaps is seen to fly around, Whilst he, pale wight, emits a plaintive sound, Like animals that furnish man with veal; Would make another pleasing scene, Showing the mettle of an arrant quean; Longing to shine a first-rate star at court, For satire's pen a subject of rare sport; Longing to purify a luckless blood, Deep-stain'd and smelling of its native mud. The valiant Gloster at the army's head, Drawn as the glorious Macedonian youth; In battle galloping o'er hills of dead, Would glow with such an air of truth!— Not on a jackass mounted, but a steed Of old Bucephalus's breed. Salisb'ry examining the iron hands Of Fame's and sweet St. Giles's blackguard bands, That clap our kings to parliament and play— Salisb'ry, too, gauging all their gaping throats, Exciseman-like, to find the best for notes, That money mayn't be thrown away: Resolv'd from those same legions of vulgarity, To get full pennyworths of popularity; Resolv'd his master shall be fairly treated, And not, as usual, by his servants cheated. Suppose to give this humour-loving isle A pretty opportunity to smile, You paint the Solomon of yon fam'd place The Royal Society., Where fair philosophy, the heav'nly dame, By barb'rous usage cover'd deep with shame, No longer shows her exil'd face: Where cent. per cent. in value rise, Toads, tadpols, grasshoppers, and flies. Suppose you paint Sir Joseph all so blest, With many a parasitical dear guest, Swoll'n by their flatt'ries like a bladder big, Throwing away of learning such a waste, And proving his superior classic taste, By swallowing the sumen of a pig. Pitt trying to unclench Britannia's fist, Imploring money for a king; Telling most mournful tales of civil list, The lady's tender heart to wring. Tales of expense in doctors' bills, High price of blisters, bolusses, and pills, Long journey to St. Paul's t'oblige the nation, And give God thanks for restoration: Britannia with arch look the while, Partaking strongly of a smile, Pointing to that huge dome The Bank of England., the nation's wealth; Where people sometimes place their cash by stealth, And all so modest with their secret store, Inform the world they're poor, ah, very poor. Brudenell and Symonds Lord B. and Sir Richard S.s's contest for the charming prize is well known to the Opera House. with each other vying, Sweet youths! for little Norman's A pretty black-eyed figurante at the Opera. favours sighing, A picturesque effect would form; That hugging mother for the daughter's charms This with the yielding damsel in his arms, Taking the citadel by storm; That running with the girl in triumph off, This with the dog, the mother, and the muff. A great law chief, whom God nor demon scares, Compell'd to kneel and pray On the thanksgiving day at St. Paul's., who swore his pray'rs, The dev'l behind him pleas'd and grinning, Patting the angry lawyer on the shoulder, Declaring nought was ever bolder, Admiring such a novel mode of sinning: Like this, a subject would be reckon'd rare, Which proves what blood-game infidels can dare; Which to my mem'ry brings a fact, Which nothing but an English tar would act— In ships of war on Sundays pray'rs are given; For though so wicked, sailors think on Heav'n, Particularly in a storm; Where, if they find no brandy to get drunk, Their souls are in a miserable funk, Then vow they to th' Almighty to reform, If in his goodness only once, once more, He'll suffer them to clap a foot on shore. In calms, indeed, or gentle airs, They ne'er on week-days pester Heav'n with pray'rs; For 'tis amongst the jacks a common saying, ‘Where there's no danger, there's no need of praying.’ One Sunday morning all were met To hear the parson preach and pray, All but a boy, who, willing to forget That pray'rs were handing out, had stol'n away; And, thinking praying but a useless task, Had crawl'd to take a nap, into a cask. The boy was soon found missing, and full soon The boatswain's cat sagacious smelt him out; Gave him a clawing to some tune— This cat's a cousin German to the knout A common punishment in Russia.. ‘Come out, you sculking dog,’ the boatswain cry'd, ‘And save your damn'd young sinful soul:’ He then the moral-mending cat apply'd, And turn'd him like a badger from his hole. Sulky the boy march'd on, and did not mind him, Although the boatswain flogging kept behind him: ‘Flog,’ cried the boy, ‘flog—curse me, flog away— I'll go—but mind—God d?mn me if I'll pray.’ THE KING OF SPAIN AND THE HORSE. IN sev'nteen hundred sev'nty-eight, The rich, the proud, the potent king of Spain, Whose ancestors sent forth their troops to smite The peaceful natives of the western main, With faggots and the blood-delighting sword, To play the devil, to oblige the Lord! For hunting, roasting heretics, and boiling, Baking and barbecuing, frying, broiling, Was thought Heav'ns cause amazingly to further; For which most pious reason, hard to work They went, with gun and dagger, knife and fork, To charm the God of Mercy with their murther! I say, this king in sev'nty-eight survey'd, In tapestry so rich, portray'd A horse with stirrups, crupper, bridle, saddle: Within the stirrup, lo, the monarch try'd To fix his foot the palfry to bestride; In vain!—he could not o'er the palfry straddle! Stiff as a Turk the beast of yarn remain'd, And ev'ry effort of the king disdain'd, Who, 'midst his labours, to the ground was tumbled, And greatly mortified, as well as humbled. Prodigious was the struggle of the day, The horse attempted not to run away; At which the poor chaf'd monarch now 'gan grin And swore by ev'ry saint and holy martyr, He would not yield the traitor quarter, Until he got possession of his skin. Not fiercer fam'd La Mancha's knight, Hight Quixote, at a puppet-show, Did with more valour stoutly fight, And terrify each little squeaking foe; When bold he pierc'd the lines, immortal fray! And broke their pasteboard bones, and stabb'd their hearts of hay. Not with more energy and fury The beauteous street-walker of Drury Attacks a sister of the smuggling trade, Whose winks, and nods, and sweet resistless smile, Ah me! her paramour beguile, And to her bed of healthy straw persuade; Where mice with music charm, and vermin crawl, And snails with silver traces deck the wall. And now a cane, and now a whip he us'd, And now he kick'd, and sore the palfry bruis'd; Yet, lo, the horse seem'd patient at each kick, And bore with Christian spirit whip and stick; And what excessively provok'd this prince, The horse so stubborn scorn'd ev'n once to wince. Now rush'd the monarch for a bow and arrow, To shoot the rebel like a sparrow; And, lo, with shafts well steel'd, with all his force, Just like a pincushion, he stuck the horse! Now with the fury of the chaf'd wild boar, With nails and teeth the wounded horse he tore; Now to the floor he brought the stubborn beast; Now o'er the vanquish'd horse that dar'd rebel, Most Indian-like the monarch gave a yell, Pleas'd on the quadruped his eyes to feast Blest as Achilles when with fatal wound He brought the mighty Hector to the ground. Yet more to gratify his god-like ire, He vengeful flung the palfry in the fire! Showing his pages round, poor trembling things, How dang'rous to resist the will of kings. LORD B. AND THE EUNUCH. A LORD, most musically mad, Yet with a taste superlatively bad, Ask'd a squeal eunuch to his house one day— A poor old semivir, whose throat Had lost his love-resounding note, Which art had giv'n, and time had stol'n away. ‘Signor Squalini,’ with a solemn air, The lord began, grave rising from his chair, Taking Squalini kindly by the hand; ‘Signor Squalini, much I fear I've got a most unlucky ear, And that 'tis known to all the music band. Fond of abuse, each fiddling coxcomb carps, And, true it is, I don't know flats from sharps: Indeed, Signor Squalini, 'tis no hum; So ill doth music with my organs suit, I scarcely know a fiddle from a flute, The hautbois from the double drum. Now though with lords a number of this nation, I go to op'ras, more through fashion Than for the love of music, I could wish The world might think I had some little taste, That those two ears were tolerably chaste, But, sir, I am as stupid as a fish. Get me the credit of a cognoscente, Gold shan't be wanting to content ye.’— ‘Bravissimo! my lor,’ replied Squalini, With acquiescent bow, and smile of suavity, De nobleman muss never look de ninny.’— ‘True,’ cry'd the noble lord, with German gravity. ‘My lor, ven men vant money in der purse, Dey do not vant de vorld to tink dem poor, Because, my lor, dat be von shabby curse; Dis all same ting wid ignorance, my lor.’— ‘Right,’ cry'd his lordship in a grumbling tone, Much like a mastiff jealous of his bone. ‘But first I want some technicals, signor’— Bowing, the eunuch answered—‘Iss, my lor; I teash your lorship queekly, queekly, all, Dere vat be call de sostenuto note, Dat be ven singer oppen vide de troat, And den for long time make de squawl— Mush long, long note, dat do continue while A man, my lor, can valk a mile. My lor, der likewise be de cromatique, As if de singer vas in greef, or sick, And had de colic—dat be ver, ver fine: De high, oh, dat musician call soprano; De low voice, basso; de soff note, piano— Bravoura, queek, bold—here Marchesi shine. Dis Mara, too, and Billington, do know— Allegro, quick; adagio, be de slow: Pomposo, dat be manner make de roar: Maestoso, dat be grand and nobel ting, Mush like de voice of emperor, or de king; Or you, my lor, When in de house you make de grand oration, For save, my lor, de noble Englis nation.’ Thus having giv'n his lesson, and a bow, With high complacency his lordship smil'd: Unravell'd was his lordship's pucker'd brow, His scowling eye, like Luna's beams, so mild: Such is th' effect, when flatteries sweet cajole That praise-admiring wight yclep'd the soul; And from the days of Adam 'tis the case, That great's the sympathy 'twixt soul and face. ‘Signor Squalini,’ cry'd the lord, ‘The op'ra is begun, upon my word— Allons, signor, and hear me—mind, As soon as ever you shall find A singer's voice above or under pitch, Just touch my toe, or give my arm a twitch.’ ‘Iss, iss, my lor,’ the eunuch straight reply'd, I sheet close by your lorship's side; And den, accordin to your lorship wish, I give your lorship elbow little twish.’ Now to the opera, music's sounds to hear, The old castrato and the noble peer Proceeded—near the orchestra they sat, Before the portals of the singers' throats! The critic couple mousing for bad notes With all the keenness of a hungry cat. Now came an out-of-tunish note— The eunuch twitch'd his lordship's coat: Full-mouth'd at once his lordship roar'd out ‘Psha!’ The orchestra, amaz'd, turn round To find from whence arose the critic sound, When, lo! they heard the lord, and saw! The eunuch kept most slily twitching, His frowning lordship all the while, (Not in the cream of courtly style) Be-dogging this poor singer, that be-bitching, Uniting too, a host of damning pshas, And reap'd a plenteous harvest of applause:— Grew from that hour a lord of tuneful skill, And though the eunuch's dead, remains so still. TO THE ACADEMICIANS. SUPPOSE you paint the Dev'l with smiling mien, Whisp'ring deceit to any king or queen, 'Tis what the prince of soot hath often done— For lo, with many a king and many a queen, In close confab the gentleman is seen— With such hath Satan oft a world of fun— More fun, or diadems are much bely'd, Than all the little under world beside. The Dev'l's a fellow of much sterling humour, If we may credit public rumour, And all so civil in each act and look, That whensoever we incline On some rare dish of sin to dine, We can't employ a nicer cook. Who, too, so generous disdains To take a sixpence for his pains—. Nay, at our money would be vext; Happy to please us gratis with his art, Provided, when from this world we depart, We join his fire-side in the next. Like Gloucester, who for pay can leave his party, Some years ago I join'd his corps so hearty, Thinking the Prince of Erebus ill treated: Fir'd by the subject, in my rhiming mode I complimented Satan with an ode, Which, for the brushmen's sake, shall be repeated. ODE TO THE DEVIL. Ingratum Odi. PRINCE of the dark abodes! I ween Your highness ne'er till now hath seen Yourself in metre shine; Ne'er heard a song with praise sincere, Sweet warbled in your smutty ear, Before this Ode of mine. Perhaps the reason is too plain, Thou triest to starve the tuneful train, Of potent verse afraid; And yet I vow, in all my time I've not beheld a single rhime That ever spoil'd thy trade. I've often read those pious whims— John Wesley's sweet damnation hymns, That chant of heav'nly riches. What have they done?—those heav'nly strains, Devoutly squeez'd from canting brains, But fill'd John's earthly breeches? There's not a shoeblack in the land, So humbly at the world's command, As thy old cloven foot; Like lightning dost thou fly, when call'd, And yet no pickpocket's so maul'd As thou, O Prince of Soot! What thousands, hourly bent on sin, With supplication call thee in, To aid them to pursue it; Yet, when detected, with a lie Ripe at their fingers' ends, they cry, ‘The Devil made me do it!’ Behold the fortunes that are made By men through roguish tricks in trade! Yet all to thee are owing— And though we meet it every day, The sneaking rascals dare not say, This is the Devil's doing. As to thy company, I'm sure No man can shun thee on that score; The very best is thine: With kings, queens, ministers of state, Lords, ladies, I have seen thee great, And many a grave divine. I'm sorely griev'd at times to find, The very instant thou art kind, Some people so uncivil, When aught offends, with face awry, With base ingratitude to cry, ‘I wish it to the Devil.’ Hath some poor blockhead got a wife, To be the torment of his life, By one eternal yell— The fellow cries out coarsely, ‘Zounds, I'd give this moment twenty pounds To see the jade at hell.’ Shou'd Heav'n their prayers so ardent grant, Thou never company wouldst want To make thee downright mad; For mind me, in their wishing mood, They never offer thee what's good, But every thing that's bad. My honest anger boils to view A snuffling, long-fac'd, canting crew, So much thy humble debtors, Rushing, on Sundays, one and all, With desp'rate pray'rs thy head to maul, And thus abuse their betters. To seize one day in every week, On thee their black abuse to wreak, By whom their souls are fed Each minute of the other six, With ev'ry joy that heart can fix, Is impudence indeed! Blushing I own thy pleasing art Hath oft reduc'd my vagrant heart, And led my steps to joy— The charms of beauty have been mine; And let me call the merit thine, Who brought'st the lovely toy. No, Satan—if I ask thy aid, To give my arms the blooming maid, I will not, through the nation all, Proclaim thee (like a graceless imp) A vile old good-for-nothing pimp, But say, ‘'tis thy vocation, Hal.’ Since truth must out—I seldom knew What 'twas high pleasure to pursue, Till thou hadst won my heart— So social were we both together, And beat the hoof in ev'ry weather, I never wish'd to part. Yet when a child—good Lord! I thought That thou a pair of horns hadst got, With eyes like saucers staring! And then a pair of ears so stout, A monstrous tail and hairy snout, With claws beyond comparing. Taught to avoid the paths of evil, By day I us'd to dread the Devil, And trembling when 'twas night, Methought I saw thy horns and ears, Then sung or whistled to my fears, And ran to chase my fright. And every night I went to bed, I sweated with a constant dread, And crept beneath the rug: There panting, thought that in my sleep Thou slily in the dark wouldst creep, And eat me, though so snug. A haberdasher's shop is thine, With sins of all sorts, coarse and fine, To suit both man and maid: Thy wares they buy, with open eyes; How cruel then, with constant cries, To vilify thy trade! To speak the truth, indeed, I'm loath— Life's deem'd a mawkish dish of broth Without thy aid, old sweeper: So mawkish, few will put it down, E'en from the cottage to the crown, Without thy salt and pepper. O Satan, whatsoever geer Thy Proteus form shall choose to wear, Black, red, or blue, or yellow; Whatever hypocrites may say, They think thee (trust my honest lay) A most bewitching fellow. 'Tis order'd (to deaf ears, alas!) To praise the bridge o'er which we pass; Yet often I discover A numerous band who daily make An easy bridge of thy poor back, And damn it when they're over. Why art thou then with cap in hand, Obsequious to a graceless band, Whose souls are scarce worth taking; O prince, pursue but my advice, I'll teach your highness in a trice To set them all a-quaking. Plays, op'ras, masquerades, destroy; Lock up each charming fille de joie; Give race-horses the glander— The dice-box break, and burn each card— Let virtue be its own reward, And gag the mouth of slander; In one week's time, I'll lay my life, There's not a man, nor maid, nor wife, That will not glad agree, If thou wilt charm 'em as before, To show their nose at church no more, But quit their God for thee. 'Tis now full time my ode should end; And now I tell thee, like a friend, Howe'er the world may scout thee; Thy ways are all so wondrous winning, And folks so very fond of sinning, They cannot do without thee. THE TENDER HUSBAND. LO, to the cruel hand of fate, My poor dear Grizzle, meek-soul'd mate, Resigns her tuneful breath— Though dropp'd her jaw, her lip though pale, And blue each harmless finger nail, She's beautiful in death. As o'er her lovely limbs I weep, I scarce can think her but asleep— How wonderfully tame! And yet her voice is really gone, And dim those eyes that lately shone With all the lightning's flame. Death was, indeed, a daring wight, To take it in his head to smite— To lift his dart to hit her; For as she was so great a woman, And car'd a single fig for no man, I thought he fear'd to meet her. Still is that voice of late so strong, That many a sweet capriccio sung, And beat in sounds the spheres? No longer must those fingers play ‘Britons strike home,’ that many a day, Hath sooth'd my ravish'd ears? Ah me! indeed I'm much inclin'd To think I now may speak my mind, Nor hurt her dear repose; Nor think I now with rage she'd roar, Were I to put my fingers o'er, And touch her precious nose. Here let me philosophic pause— How wonderful are nature's laws, When ladies' breath retires, Its fate the flaming passions share, Supported by a little air, Like culinary fires! Whene'er I hear the bagpipe's note, Shall fancy fix on Grizzle's throat, And loud instructive lungs: O Death, in her, though only one, Are lost a thousand charms unknown, At least a thousand tongues. Soon as I heard her last sweet sigh, And saw her gently-closing eye, How great was my surprise! Yet have I not, with impious breath, Accus'd the hard decrees of death, Nor blam'd the righteous skies. Why do I groan in deep despair, Since she'll be soon an angel fair? Ah! why my bosom smite? Could grief my Grizzle's life restore?— But let me give such ravings o'er— Whatever is, is right. Oh, doctor! you are come too late; No more of physic's virtue prate, That could not save my lamb: Not one more bolus shall be giv'n— You shall not ope her mouth by heav'n, And Grizzle's gullet cram. Enough of bolusses, poor heart! And pills, she took, to load a cart, Before she clos'd her eyes; But now my word is here a law, Zounds! with a bolus in her jaw, She shall not seek the skies. Good sir, good doctor, go away; To hear my sighs you must not stay, For this my poor lost treasure: I thank you for your pains and skill; When next you come, pray bring your bill; I'll pay it, sir, with pleasure. Ye friends who come to mourn her doom, For God's sake gently tread the room, Nor call her from the blest— In softest silence drop the tear, In whispers breathe the fervent pray'r, To bid her spirit rest. Repress the sad, the wounding scream: I cannot bear a grief extreme— Enough one little sigh— Besides, the loud alarm of grief, In many a mind may start belief, Our noise is all a lie. Good nurses, shroud my lamb with care; Her limbs, with gentlest fingers, spare; Her mouth, ah! slowly close; Her mouth a magic tongue that held— Whose softest tone, at times, compell'd, To peace my loudest woes. And, carpenter, for my sad sake, Of stoutest oak her coffin make— I'd not be stingy, sure— Procure of steel the strongest screws; For who would paltry pence refuse To lodge his wife secure? Ye people who the corpse convey, With caution tread the doleful way, Nor shake her precious head; Since fame reports a coffin tost, With careless swing against a post, Did once disturb the dead. Farewell, my love, for ever lost; Ne'er troubled be thy gentle ghost, That I again will woo— By all our past delights, my dear, No more the marriage chain I'll wear, P?x take me if I do! THE SOLDIER AND THE VIRGIN MARY. A TALE. A SOLDIER at Loretto's wondrous chapel, To parry from his soul the wrath divine, That follow'd mother Eve's unlucky apple, Did visit oft the Virgin Mary's shrine; Who ev'ry day is gorgeously deck'd out, In silks or velvets, jewels, great and small, Just like a fine young lady for a rout, A concert, opera, wedding, or a ball. At first the soldier at a distance kept, Begging her vote and interest in heav'n— With seeming bitterness the sinner wept, Wrung his two hands, and hop'd to be forgiv'n: Dinn'd her two ears with Ave-Mary flummery; Declar'd what miracles the dame could do, Ev'n with her garter, stocking, or her shoe, And such-like wonder-working mummery. What answer Mary gave the wheedling sinner, Who nearly, and more nearly mov'd to win her, The mouth of hist'ry doth not mention, And therefore I can't tell but by invention. One day as he was making love and praying, And pious aves, thick as herrings, saying, And sins so manifold confessing; He drew, as if to whisper, very near, And twitch'd a pretty diamond from her ear, Instead of taking the good lady's blessing. Then off he set with nimble shanks, Nor once turn'd back to give her thanks: A hue and cry the thief pursu'd, Who, to his cost, soon understood That he was not beyond the claw Of that same long-arm'd giant christen'd Law. With horror did his judges quake— As for the tender-conscienc'd jury, They doom'd him quickly to the stake, Such was their dev'lish pious fury, However, after calling him hard names, They ask'd if aught he had in vindication, To save his wretched body from the flames, And sinful soul from terrible damnation. The soldier answered them with much sang froid, Which show'd, of sin, a conscience void, That if they meant to kill him, they might kill: As for the diamond which they found about him, He hop'd they would by no means doubt him, That madam gave it him from pure good will. The answer turn'd both judge and jury pale: The punishment was for a time deferr'd, Until his holiness should hear the tale, And his infallibility be heard. The pope, to all his counsellors, made known This strange affair—to cardinals and friars, Good pious gentlemen, who ne'er were known To act like hypocrites, and thieves, and liars. The question now was branded to and fro, If Mary had the pow'r to give or no. That Mary could not give it, was to say, The wonder-working lady wanted pow'r— This was a stumbling block that stopp'd the way— This made pope, cardinals, and friars low'r. To save the Virgin's credit, lo! And keep secure the di'monds that were left; They said, she might, indeed, the gem bestow, And consequently it might be no theft: But then they pass'd immediately an act, That ev'ry one discovered in the fact, Of taking presents from the Virgin's hand, Or from the saints of any land, Should know no mercy, but be led to slaughter, Flay'd here, and fry'd eternally hereafter. Ladies, I deem the moral much too clear To need poetical assistance; Which bids you not let men approach too near, But keep the saucy fellows at a distance: Since men you find, so bold, are apt to seize Jewels from ladies even upon their knees! AN ODE TO EIGHT CATS, Belonging to Israel Mendez, a Jew. SCENE—The Street in a Country Town. The Time, Midnight—the Poet at his Chamber Window. SINGERS of Israel, oh ye singers sweet, Who, with your gentle mouths from ear to ear, Pour forth rich symphonies from street to street, And to the sleepless wretch the night endear; Lo! in my shirt, on you these eyes I fix, Admiring much the quaintness of your tricks; Your friskings, crawlings, squalls, I much approve; Your spittings, pawings, high-rais'd rumps, Swell'd tails, and merry-andrew jumps, With the wild minstrelsy of rapt'rous love. How sweetly roll your gooseb'rry eyes, As loud you tune your am'rous cries, And, loving, scratch each other black and blue! No boys in wantonness now bang your backs, No curs, nor fiercer mastiffs, tear your flax, But all the moonlight world seems made for you. Singers of Israel, you no parsons want To tie the matrimonial cord; You call the matrimonial service, cant— Like our first parents, take each other's word: On no one ceremony pleas'd to fix— To jump not even o'er two sticks. You want no furniture, alas! Spit, spoon, dish, frying-pan, nor ladle; No iron, pewter, copper, tin or brass; No nurses, wet or dry, nor cradle, Which custom, for our Christian babes, enjoins, To rock the staring offspring of your loins. Nor of the lawyers have you need, Ye males, before you seek your bed, To settle pin-money on madam: No fears of cuckoldom, heav'n bless ye, Are ever harbour'd to distress ye, Tormenting people since the days of Adam. No schools you want for fine behaving, No powdering, painting, washing, shaving, No nightcaps snug—no trouble in undressing Before you seek your strawy nest, Pleas'd in each other's arms to rest, To feast on love, heav'n's greatest blessing. Good gods! ye sweet love-chanting rams! How nimble are you with your hams To mount a house, to scale a chimney-top; And peeping down that chimney's hole, Pour in a tuneful cry th' impassion'd soul, Inviting Miss Grimalkin to come up: Who, sweet obliging female, far from coy, Answers your invitation note with joy, And scorning 'midst the ashes more to mope; Lo! borne on love's all-daring wing, She mounteth with a pickle-herring spring, Without th' assistance of a rope. Dear mousing tribe, my limbs are waxing cold— Singers of Israel sweet, adieu, adieu! I do suppose you need not now be told How much I wish that I was one of you. SONG TO DELIA. FORLORN I seek the silent scene To keep the image of my fair; Pale o'er the fountain's brink I lean, And view the spectre of despair. Why should my heart forget its woe? The virgin would have mourn'd for me— O nymph, th' eternal tear shall flow; The sigh unceasing breathe of thee. Forgetful of his parted maid, Too many an unfeeling swain Forsakes of solitude the shade, For pleasure's gay and wanton train. Yet, yet of constancy they boast!— Their easy hearts their tongues belie— Who loves, reveres the fair one's ghost, And seeks a pleasure in a sigh. SIR J. BANKS AND THE THIEFTAKERS. SIR Joseph, fav'rite of great queens and kings, Whose wisdom, weed and insect hunter sings; And ladies fair applaud, with smile so dimpling; Went forth one day, amidst the laughing fields, Where nature such exhaustless treasure yields, A simpling! It happen'd on the self-same morn so bright, The nimble pupils of Sir Sampson Wright, A simpling too for plants call'd thieves, proceeded: Of which the nation's field should oft be weeded. Now did a thieftaker so sly, Peep o'er a hedge with cunning eye, And quick espy'd the knight with solemn air, Deep in a ditch where watercresses grow; On which he to his comrades cry'd, ‘See, ho!’ Then jump'd (unsportsman like) upon his hare. Hare-like Sir Joseph did not squeak, but bawl'd, With dread prodigiously appall'd— The thieftakers no ceremony us'd; But taking poor Sir Joseph by the neck, They bade him speak; But first with names their captive knight abus'd. ‘Sir, what d'ye take me for?’ the knight exlaim'd— ‘A thief!’ reply'd the runners with a curse: ‘And now, sir, let us search you, and be damn'd!’ And then they search'd his pockets, fobs, and purse: But 'stead of pistol dire, and crape, A pocket-handkerchief they cast their eye on, Containing frogs and toads of various shape, Dock, daisy, nettletop, and dandelion, To entertain, with great propriety, The members of his sage Society: Yet would not alter they their strong belief, That this their pris'ner was no thief! ‘Sirs, I'm no highwayman,’ exclaim'd the knight— ‘No—there,’ rejoin'd the runners, ‘you are right— A footpad only—Yes, we know your trade— Yes, you're a pretty babe of grace: We want no proofs, old codger, but your face; So come along with us, old blade.’ 'Twas useless to resist, or to complain— In vain, Sir Joseph pleaded—'twas in vain That he was highly titled, that he swore— The instant that poor Banks his titles counted, Which to an F. R. S. and knight amounted, His guardians laugh'd, and clapp'd, and cry'd ‘encore!’ Sir Joseph told them, that a neighb'ring 'squire Should answer for it that he was no thief: On which they plumply damn'd him for a liar, And said such stories should not save his beef; And if they understood their trade, His mittimus would soon be made; And forty pounds be theirs, a pretty sum, For sending such a rogue to kingdom come. Now to the 'squire mov'd pris'ner knight and Co. The runners taking him in tow, Like privateers of Britain's warlike nation, Towing a French East-Indiaman, their prize, So black, and of enormous size, Safe into port for condemnation. Whether they tied his hands behind his back, For fear the knight might run away, And made, indelicate, his breeches slack, We've no authority to say. And now the country people gather'd round, And star'd upon the knight in thought profound, Not on the system of Linnæus thinking— Fancying they saw a rogue in ev'ry feature;— Such is the populace's horrid nature Tow'rds people through misfortune sinking. At length amidst much mob and mire, Indeed amidst innumerable ranks, Fatigu'd, they reach'd the mansion of the 'squire, To prove th' identity of Joseph Banks. Now to the 'squire, familiar bow'd the knight, Who knew Sir Joseph at first sight— What's strongly mark'd, is quickly known agen— And with a frown that awe and dread commanded, The thieftakers severely reprimanded For thus mistaking gentlemen. Then bade them ask a pardon on their knees, Of him that was a knight and F. R. S.— Who, rather than the higher pow'rs displease, Imagin'd that they could not well do less— Then on their knuckles rais'd they hands and eyes, And crav'd Sir Joseph's pardon for belief, That when they jump'd upon him by surprise, They took so great a gemman for a thief, Hoping to mind th' advice of godly books, Viz. not to judge of people by their looks. SOLOMON AND THE MOUSETRAP. A MAN in rather an exalted station, Whose eyes are always eyes of admiration, Without distinction, fond of all things novel, Ev'n from the lofty sceptre to the shovel— Just like stray'd bullocks saunt'ring thro' the lanes, Made frequent curiosity campaigns; Sometimes caught grasshoppers—now more profound, Would sometimes find a pin upon the ground; Where if the head towards him happ'd to point, His mind was wonderfully struck— Indeed he felt a joy in ev'ry joint, Because it always brings good luck. This gentleman, hight Solomon, one day In quest of novelty pursu'd his way; Like great Columbus, that fam'd navigator, Who found the world we've lost across the water; But rather on a somewhat narrower scale, Lo! on dry land the gentleman set sail— That day it chanc'd to be his will, To make discoveries at Salthill; Where bounce he hopp'd into a widow's house, Whose hands were both employ'd so clever, Doing their very best endeavour To catch that vile freebooter, Monsieur Mouse; Whose death she oft did most devoutly pray for, Because he eat the meat he could not pay for. Resembling Christians in that saving trick, Who, wanting to obtain good cheer, Invented an ingenious scheme call'd tick, That purchases, like money, beef and beer: Possess'd of tick, for cash man need not range, Nor toil in taking or in giving change. Eager did Solomon so curious clap His rare round optics on the wondrous trap That did the duty of a cat; And always fond of useful information, Thus wisely spoke he with vociferation: ‘What's that?—What, what? hæ, hæ! what's that:’ To whom, reply'd the mistress of the house, ‘A trap, an't please you, sir, to catch a mouse.’ ‘Mouse!—catch a mouse!’ said Solomon with glee— ‘Let's see—let's see—'tis comical—let's see— Mouse!—mouse!’—then pleas'd his eyes began to roll— ‘Where, where doth he go in? he marvelling cry'd— ‘There,’ pointing to the hole, the dame reply'd.— ‘What here?’ cry'd Solomon; ‘this hole, this hole?’ Then in he push'd his finger 'midst the wire, That with such pains that finger did inspire, He wish'd it out again with all his soul: However, by a little squall and shaking, He freed his finger from its piteous taking— That is to say, he got it from the hole. ‘What makes the mouse, pray, go into the trap?— Something,’ he cry'd ‘that must their palates please.’ ‘Yes,’ answer'd the fair woman, ‘sir, a scrap Of rusty bacon, or of toasted cheese.’ ‘Oh! oh!’ said Solomon, ‘oh! oh! oh! oh! Yes, yes, I see the meaning of it now— The mouse goes in, a rogue, to steal the meat, Thinking to give his gums a pretty treat.’ Then laugh'd he loudly, stretch'd his mouth a mile, Which made the muscles of the widow smile. ‘Let's see, let's see,’ cry'd Solomon—‘let's see— Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me.’ Then took he up some bacon, and did clap A little slice so clever in the trap. Thus did he by his own advice, Induce himself to bait a trap for mice! Now home he hied so nimbly, whelm'd with glory, And told his family the wondrous story About the widow's cheese and bacon scrap! Nought suffer'd he to occupy his head, Save mouse ideas, till he went to bed, Where blest he dreamt all night about the trap. Here let me pause, and Heav'n's great goodness chant— How kind it is in gracious Heav'n to grant To full-grown gentlefolks of lofty station, A pow'r of relishing most trifling things, Pleasures ordain'd for brats in leading strings, By way of happy harmless relaxation! Next day the man of wisdom came, All glorious, to the house of this fair dame, To known if master mouse had smelt to bacon; When, lo! to fill with joy his eager eyes, And load those staring optics with surprise, A real mouse was absolutely taken! Not more did Rodney's joy this man surpass, When in his cabin first he saw De Grasse! Not more the hair-brain'd Macedonian boy, Leap'd, like a Bedlamite, for joy, Than Solomon to see the mouse in jail! Not Alexander, foe of great Darius, (Men that with rich comparison supply us) When blest he caught the Persian by the tail. Around the room the mouse he bore, Insulting the poor pris'ner o'er and o'er; Laughing and peeping through the wire, As if his eyes and mouth would never tire! How like to Tamerlane the great, Possess'd of most unlucky Bajazet, Who kept the vanquish'd hero in a cage; Mock'd him before his mighty host, With cruel names and threats, and grin and boast, And daily thus indulg'd imperial rage! Now o'er the widow's cat, poor watching puss, He triumph'd too, and ask'd the cat, When he would act heroically thus?— And if he dar'd to venture on a rat? To whom the cat, as if in answer, mew'd, Which made the man of wisdom cry, ‘Oh! oh!’ As if with knowledge of cat speech endu'd, He thought that puss had answer'd ‘No,’ On which he laugh'd, and much enjoy'd the joke— Then told the widow what the cat had spoke. Six days the man of wisdom went Triumphant to Salthill, with big intent, To catch the bacon-stealing mouse; Six mice successively proclaim'd his art, With which safe pocketed he did depart, And show'd to all his much-astonish'd house. But pleasures will not last for aye; Witness the sequel of my lay— The widow's vanity, her sex's flaw, Much like the vanity of other people— A vapour, like the blast that lifts a straw, As high, or higher, than Saint Martin's steeple: This vanity then kidnapp'd her discretion, Design'd by God Almighty for her guard; And of its purpose got the full completion, And all the widow's future glories marr'd: For, lo! by this same vanity impell'd, And to a middle-siz'd balloon, With gas of consequence sublimely swell'd, She burst with the important secret soon. Loud laugh'd the tickled people of Salthill— Loud laugh'd the merry Windsor folks around— This was to Solomon an ugly pill!— Her fatal error soon the widow found— For Solomon relinquish'd mouse campaign, Nor deign'd to bait the widow's trap again! PETITION TO TIME IN FAVOUR OF THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE. TOO long, O Time, in Bienseance's school Have I been bred, to call thee an old fool; Yet take I liberty to let thee know, That I have always thought thee so: Full old art thou to have more sense— Then, with an idle custom, Time, dispense. Thou really actest now, like little misses, Who, when a pretty doll they make, Their curious fingers itch to take The pretty image all to pieces: Thus, after thou hast form'd a charming fair, Thou canst not quit her for thy soul, Till, meddling, thou hast spoil'd her bloom and air, And dimn'd her eye, with radiance taught to roll. But now forbear such doings, I desire— Hurt not the form that all admire— Oh, never with white hairs her temple sprinkle— Oh, sacred be her cheek, her lip, her bloom, And do not, in a lovely dimple's room, Place a hard mortifying wrinkle. Know, shouldst thou bid the beauteous duchess fade, Thou, therefore, must thy own delights invade; And know, 'twill be a long, long while, Before thou giv'st her equal to our isle— Then do not with this sweet chef d'œuvre part, But keep, to show the triumph of thy art. ŒCONOMY. ŒCONOMY's a very useful broom; Yet should not ceaseless hunt about the room To catch each straggling pin to make a plumb— Too oft œconomy's an iron vice, That squeezes ev'n the little guts of mice, That peep with fearful eyes, and ask a crumb. Proper œconomy's a comely thing— Good in a subject—better in a king; Yet push'd too far, it dulls each finer feeling— Most easily inclin'd to make folks mean; Inclines them too to villany to lean, To over-reaching, perjury, and stealing. Ev'n when the heart should only think of grief, It creeps into the bosom like a thief, And swallows up th' affections all so mild— Witness the Jewess, and her only child. THE JEWESS AND HER SON. POOR Mistress Levi had a luckless son, Who, rushing to obtain the foremost seat In imitation of th' ambitious great, High from the gall'ry, ere the play begun, He fell all plump into the pit, Dead in a minute as a nit: In short, he broke his pretty Hebrew neck; Indeed and very dreadful was the wreck! The mother was distracted, raving, wild— Shriek'd, tore her hair, embrac'd and kiss'd her child— Afflicted every heart with grief around: Soon as the show'r of tears was somewhat past, And moderately calm th' hysteric blast, She cast about her eyes in thought profound: And being with a saving knowledge bless'd, She thus the playhouse manager address'd:— ‘Sher, I'm de moder of de poor Chew lad, Dat meet mishfarten here so bad— Sher, I muss haf de shilling back, you know, Ass Moses haf nat see de show.’ But as for av'rice, 'tis the very devil; The fount, alas! of ev'ry evil; The cancer of the heart—the worst of ills: Wherever sown, luxuriantly it thrives; No flow'r of virtue near it thrives: Like aconite, where'er it spreads, it kills. In ev'ry soil behold the poison spring! Can taint the beggar, and infect the king. The mighty Marlb'rough pilfer'd cloth and bread; So says that gentle satirist 'squire Pope; And Peterborough's earl upon this head, Affords us little room to hope, That what the Twitnam bard avow'd. Might not be readily allow'd. THE EARL OF PETERBOROUGH AND THE MOB. THROUGH London streets upon a day, The Earl of Peterborough took his way, All in his pompous coach—perhaps to dine— The mob of London took it in their head, This was the Duke of Marlborough, so dread To Frenchmen on the Danube and the Rhine. Unable such high merit to reward, The mob resolv'd to show a great regard; And so uniting, join'd their forces To draw his carriage, and dismiss the horses. The earl from out his carriage pok'd his face, And told the mob that he was not his grace; Then bid them be convinc'd and look: Hard of belief, as ev'n the hardest Jew, They told him that they better knew, Then swore by G? he was the duke: Then threw their hats in air with loud huzzas, And form'd a thunder of applause. Loud bawl'd the earl that they were all deceiv'd— Loud bawl'd the mob he should not be believ'd— ‘Zounds!’ cry'd the earl, ‘be converts then this minute;’ So throwing sixpence to them, ‘there, there, there, ‘Take that,’ cried Peterborough, with a sneer— ‘Now if you think I'm he, the devil's in it.’ ODE TO A DISTRESSED BEAUTY. SWEET girl, forbear to droop thy head with shame— What though the parson did not tie the knot? What though the boy should come?—he'll bring thee fame— The world's an ass, and custom is a sot— Hold up thy head, and meet mankind with pride, And throw thy blushes and thy fears aside. Eve had no parson—for no priest was Adam, And yet not out of countenance was madam; Her modesty receiv'd no grievous shocks, When Master Cain was put upon the stocks; Nor when, t'increase the number at her table, She set about the frame of Master Abel. Once more, then, do not be afraid; Without thy boy, a wonder may be missing— A likeness of my charming maid, The boy may do a credit to thy kissing. Thou putt'st me of the morning much in mind, Who seems afraid to peep upon mankind— So slow her motions! all so very slow! And then her cheeks so deep with crimson glow: But safe deliver'd of her boy, the sun, The lusty lad, so proud his race to run, Mounts high exulting in his birth; Dries up her tears, her blushes puts to flight, Tow'rs in bold triumph o'er the cloud of night, And pours a flood of radiance o'er the earth. Then let me kiss away thy tears— Oh! cease thy sighs, and be a happy mother; And when this chopping boy appears, Suppose we give the lad a little brother? THE GENTLEMAN AND HIS WIFE. PEOPLE may have too much of a good thing— Full as an egg of wisdom thus I sing! A man of some small fortune had a wife, Sans doute, to be the comfort of his life; And pretty well they bore the yoke together: With little jarring liv'd the pair one year; Sometimes the matrimonial sky was clear, At times 'twas dark and dull, and hazy weather. Now came the time when mistress in the straw Did, for the world's support, her screams prepare; And Slop appear'd with fair obstetric paw, To introduce his pupil to our air; Whilst in a neighb'ring room the husband sat, Musing on this thing now, and now on that; Now sighing at the sorrows of his wife; Praying to Heav'n that he could take the pain; But recollecting that such pray'rs were vain, He made no more an offer of his life. As thus he mus'd in solemn study, Ideas sometimes clear, and sometimes muddy, In Betty rush'd with comfortable news— ‘Sir, sir, I wish you joy, I wish you joy— Madam is brought to bed of a fine boy— As fine as ever stood in shoes.’ ‘I'm glad on't, Betty,’ cry'd the master— ‘I pray there may be no disaster; All's with your mistress well, I hope?’ Quoth she, ‘All's well as heart can well desire With madam and the fine young 'squire; So likewise says old Doctor Slop.’ Off Betty hurried fast as she could scour, Fast and as hard as any horse That trotteth fourteen miles an hour— A pretty tolerable course. Soon happy Betty came again, Blowing with all her might and main; Just like a grampus or a whale; In sounds, too, that would Calais reach from Dover, ‘Sir, sir, more happy tidings; 'tis not over— And madam's brisker than a nightingale: ‘A fine young lady to the world is come, Squalling away just as I left the room— Sir, this is better than a good estate.’ ‘Humph!’ quoth the happy man, and scratch'd his pate. Now looking up—now looking down— Not with a smile, but somewhat like a frown ‘Good God,’ says he, ‘why was not I a cock, Who never feels of burd'ning brats the shock; Who, Turk-like, struts amidst his madams picking, Whilst to the hen belongs the care To carry them to eat, or take the air, Or bed beneath her wing the chicken?’ Just as this sweet soliloquy was ended, He found affairs not greatly mended; For in bounc'd Bet, her rump with rapture jigging, ‘Another daughter, sir—a charming child.’— ‘Another!’ cry'd the man, with wonder wild; ‘Zounds! Betty, ask your mistress if she's pigging.’ THE PARSON-DEALER. WHAT pity 'tis, in this our goodly land, That 'mongst the apostolic band, So ill divided are the loaves and fishes! Archbishops, bishops, deans, and deacons, With ruddy faces blazing just like beacons, Shall daily cram upon a dozen dishes; Whilst half th' inferior cassocks think it well Of beef and pudding ev'n to get a smell. A plodding hostler willing to be master, And rise in this good world a little faster, Left broom and manger at the Old Blue Boar; Meaning by pars'ning to support a table, Lo, of divines he kept a liv'ry stable— A pretty stud indeed—about a score. Of diff'rent colours were his gospel hacks— Some few were whites, indeed—but many blacks; That is, some tolerable—many sad: And verily, to give the devil his due, The man did decency pursue, Which shows he was not quite so bad. For, lo! to dying persons of nobility, He sent his parsons of gentility, To give the necessary pray'r— To parting people of a mean condition, Wanting a soul physician, He suited them with blackguards to a hair. To such as were of mild disorders dying, Viz. of the doctor, gouts, or stones, or gravels, He sent good priests—of manners edifying— To comfort sinners on their travels: But to low people in infectious fever, Or any other dangerous one in vogue, Such was his honesty, the man for ever Most scrupulously sent a rogue. It happen'd on a day when fate was raging, Crimp-like, for other regions troops engaging, When clergymen were busy all as bees; A poor old dying woman sent To this same parson-monger compliment, Begging a clergyman her soul to ease. Unluckily but one was in the stall, And he the very best of all!— What shou'd be done? Necessitas non habet legs— So to the priest he goes and begs That he would visit the old crone. ‘Sir,’ quoth the parson, ‘I agreed To go to gentlefolks in time of need, But not to every poor old lousy soul.’— ‘True,’ cry'd the patron; ‘to be sure 'tis true; But, parson, do oblige me—prithee do— Let's put her decently into the hole: ‘All my black tribe, you know, are now abroad— I'd do it, if I could, myself, by G?d! Then what a dickens can I do or say?— Go, mumble, man, about a pray'r and half; Tell the old b??ch her soul is safe; Then take your fee and come away!!!’ BIENSEANCE. THERE is a little moral thing in France, Call'd by the natives bienseance; Much are the English mob inclin'd to scout it, But rarely is Monsieur Canaille without it. To bienseanee 'tis tedious to incline, In many cases; To flatter, par exemple, keep smooth faces When kick'd, or suff'ring grievous want of coin. To vulgars, bienseance may seem an oddity— I deem it a most portable commodity; A sort of magic wand, Which, if 'tis us'd with ingenuity, Although an utensil of much tenuity, In place of something solid, it will stand. For verily I've marvell'd times enow To see an Englishman, the ninny, Give people for their services a guinea, Which Frenchmen have rewarded with a bow. Bows are a bit of bienseance Much practis'd too in that same France; Yet call'd by quakers, children of inanity; But as they pay their court to people's vanity, Like rolling-pins they smooth where'er they go The souls and faces of mankind like dough! With some, indeed, may bienseance prevail To folly—see the under-written tale. THE PETIT MAITRE, AND THE MAN ON THE WHEEL. AT Paris some time since, a murd'ring man, A German, and a most unlucky chap, Sad, stumbling at the threshold of his plan, Fell into justice's strong trap. The bungler was condemn'd to grace the wheel, On which the dullest fibres learn to feel; His limbs secundum artem to be broke Amidst ten thousand people, p'rhaps, or more: Whenever Monsieur Ketch apply'd a stroke, The culprit, like a bullock, made a roar. A flippant petit-maitre skipping by Stepp'd up to him, and check'd him for his cry— ‘Boh!’ quoth the German; ‘an't I 'pon de wheel? D'ye tink my nerfs and bons can't feel?’ ‘Sir,’ quoth the beau, ‘don't, don't be in a passion; I've nought to say about your situation; But making such a hideous noise in France, Fellow, is contrary to bienseance.’ THE TRIUMPH OF ISIS, OR DR. CHAPMAN's THESIS. OXFORD's Vice Chancellor, a man Who fear'd the Lord, and lov'd the courtier clan, By virtue of his trade a Thesis A Latin Thesis is annually given out by the vice chancellor for the subject of a poem, and twenty pounds allotted to the prize candidate. ordered, Which curs'd the terrible assassination Intended for the monarch of our nation By Marg'ret Nicholson, in mind disorder'd; That likewise prais'd the royal peep On Oxford and the arts so deep. So violent was Doctor Chapman's zeal, He quite forgot Latinity and graces: Poor Priscian's head, whose wounds he cannot heal, Was broken in half a dozen places. Yet though a simple doctor, how amazing! He set the university a-blazing— Such was the kindling zeal that he inherits— A farthing candle in a cask of spirits! Richards of Trinity, who won the prize, Now strutted victor forth with scornful eyes; Bringing to mind the bards and tuneful dames, Who vied for conquest at th' Olympic games. Forth march'd, too, vice—videlicet, the doctor, Who, purring for preferment, slily mouses, Attended by each dog-whipper, call'd proctor, And eke the heads and tails of all the houses. Forth march'd the nobles in their Sunday's geer; Forth strutted, too, each beadle, like the peer, With silver staffs, blue gowns, and velvet caps— A set of very pompous-looking chaps! Whilst Hayes The organist., who sticks like stag-hounds to a haunch, Mov'd on in all the majesty of paunch: To greet of all our ears the trembling drums, The piper play'd ‘The conquering hero comes!’ Loud groan'd the organ through his hundred pipes, As if the poor machine had got the gripes; As if, too, 'twas the organ's firm persuasions, He oft had roar'd on more sublime occasions. Now Chapman took, 'midst great compeers, his station— Crew open'd subject in a fair oration— Then clapp'd was Crew—to him applause was news— Now 'gan the bard his poem to recite, And, soaring, bade poor common sense good night, So lofty were the pinions of his muse! Thick as the pattering hail his praises show'r— So strong his poetry's mechanic pow'r, High mounts the monarch by his tuneful lever; His muse's magnifying art so great, Behold his George, an Alfred form complete; Small Peg, Goliah, and her knife her cleaver! Now back the sable bodies mov'd again, Like beetles all so thick, a crawling host; Whilst contemplation wrapp'd the loyal train, Expecting, by the next day's post, To see their acts in pompous print display'd, And wreaths of glory crown the cavalcade! A SERIOUS REFLECTION. How useless was th' above! each person grieves, And, with the grieving doctor, cries out shame, That so much loyal zeal for nought should flame, Not ev'n obtain a pair of coarse lawn sleeves, Which poor Saint David giveth to support The holy oil-of-fool men of a court. ODE TO PATIENCE. SWEET daughter of religion, modest fair, Thy hands upon thy bosom so tranquille, With eyes to Heav'n, with so divine an air, So calmly smiling, so resign'd thy will; Oh sent to teach us, and our passions cool, I wish thou hadst a little larger school! Lo, man, so great his want of grace, If he but cuts a pimple on his face When shaving; Like man bewitch'd he jumps about, Kicks up a most infernal rout, And seemeth absolutely raving; And, lo, all this for want of thy tuition— Thus travel souls of people to perdition! Stand at my side, oh stoic dame— On starling Martyn bid me cry out ‘shame,’ Instead of knocking the dull fellow down, When up the ninny-hammer starts to preach, And impudently interrupts a speech Of orators of fair and first renown, Just like the owl that scares the moonlight hour, Whilst Philomela warbles from her bow'r. And, oh! attend me when my eyes View dedications fill'd with fulsome lies, In praise of gen'rous queens and kings; Heav'n swell the fountains of their hearts, That seldom water the poor arts, However sweetly adulation sings: Eke, when I hear that stupid parson H? God's house with ev'ry nonsense fill, And then with blasphemy each sentence cramm'd; And when I hear th' impostor cry, ‘I've news, you raggamuffins, from the sky; I'm come to tell ye, that you'll all be damn'd; I'm come from God, ye strumpets—come from God— I'm God Almighty's servant—hear my voice.’— Which if it were so would be vastly odd, Since Heav'n would show bad judgment in the choice: Dead all his money-loving soul's desires, When subtle Hawkesb'ry talks of patriot fires, And yielding places up to save the nation; When of importance braggeth simple Leeds; When Gloster's far-fam'd wife for meekness pleads; And Gloster's duke breathes war and desolation; When Brudenell talks of elegance and ease; When Thurlow turns the first of devotees, And, to astound the million, builds a church; When royal folks of purest friendship boast, Make generosity their constant toast, Yet leave poor pining merit in the lurch; When wonders through his spy-glass Marlb'rough views, And sends to Banks the great, th' important news, Fresh from his cranium's philosophic fogs; When Dick descants on any thing but croute, When Thompson aught performs beyond a scout, And Mawbey talks of any thing but hogs: Sweet Patience, sooth me with thy saint-like note, Or, driv'n to madness, I shall cut my throat! TO A NEST OF LORDS. BED-CHAMBER utensils, you seem distress'd, And swear with horror that my rhimes molest Of certain folks so great the sweet repose; Running about with horrors, groans and sighs, And floods, produc'd by onions, in your eyes, So strong your friendship, and so vast your woes! Dear humming lords, on friendship bray no more, Nor thus the bard's depravity deplore; Lo! like yourselves each man his trumpet bears, In tame credulity's wide-gaping ears, Of friendship the sublimity to sound— Friendship! in dictionaries only found! Perchaunce, my lords, in foreign parts you've been— Perchaunce your optics fair Versailles have seen; Likewise the Vatican with all its state, And eke th' Escurial, pride of Spain confest; But, 'midst those scenes, did e'er your eye-balls blest See a pig hanging in a gate? If e'er you did this last great sight behold, You need not, lords, so sapient, to be told What most untuneful notes the pris'ner makes: Indeed the hog his mouth and lungs employs In raising such ear-crucifying noise, As if he really was transfix'd with stakes. Now near him should there happen to be hogs Passing their happy hours among the bogs, Grunting soft things to their own flesh and blood; That is, unto their sweethearts and their brides, Lying like ancient Romans on their sides, And dining on the dainties of the mud; Forgetting love, and dainty mud so fatt'ning, In which they had been batt'ning, Up leaps the herd of swine for his protection; Just like the herd that had the devil, Away they scamper, all so civil, Resolving or to free him or to die— Such is of swine the friendly quality, Although proverbial for brutality! But when at Newgate to be hung, A Christian pours a dying song, I grant that numbers hasten to the wretch, Most pig-like—but, alas! lift not a hand To keep him longer in the land, And snatch him from the talons of Jack Ketch. No; on the contrary, so fond their eyes Of seeing how a brother dies, I, from the bottom of my soul believe, They would not wish him a reprieve. Thus, were your good friend Pitt condemn'd to swing— Nay, ev'n were greater people I could name, For whom with goodly zeal you seem to flame— I don't believe you'd wish to cut the string, Were you but tolerably sure The next in pow'r would give you sixpence more. Learn, then, my lords, though with contempt you treat 'em, Friendship from hogs, as well as eat 'em. At length my Subjects end, and now To folly let me make my best court bow— O goddess, still monopolise the great: Then oft, to please the palate of the times, The Muse shall ride to market with her rhimes, And thrive upon her Helicon estate. EXPOSTULATORY ODES TO A GREAT DUKE AND A LITTLE LORD. ? Torrens dicendi copia multis, Et sua mortifera est facundia! ? JUVENAL. Full many a wight hath suffer'd for a song, And curs'd his volubility of tongue. That Peter may not thus have cause to say With Juvenal, poor fellow, let us pray! EPISTLE DEDICATORY. MY LORDS, YOUR uncommon attention to my late publications demands a return of gratitude. Permit me to present to your lordships the following Lyric Trifles, which, if possessed of merit sufficient to preserve them from oblivion, will inform posterity that you existed.I am, my Lords, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. PETER PINDAR. ODE I. Most noble peers there goes an odd report, That you, prime fav'rites of an honest court, Are hunting treason 'midst my publications— Hunting, like blood-hounds, with the keenest noses, Which hound-like hunting nat'rally supposes The bard dares satirize the king of nations. Ye sharp state-mousers, with your watering jaws, God keep me from the vengeance of your claws: An Asiatic fight may be renew'd; What feathers flying, what a field of blood, 'Twixt falcon Burke and Sheridan, so brave, And heron Hastings, such a dainty dish, So wont to cram on Asiatic fish, The largest, fattest of the eastern wave! Yes, yes, I hear that you have watch'd my note, And wish'd to squeeze my tuneful throat; When Thurlow your designs most wisely scouted, Swearing the poet should not yet be knouted. Thus when grimalkin in its cage espies A linnet or canary bird, so sweet; The scoundrel lifts, so sanctified, his eyes, Contriving how the warbler's back to greet: He squints, and licks his lips, stalks round, and round, Twinkling with mischief fraught his tiger tail; Now on his rump he sits, in thought profound, Looks up with hungry wishes to assail; When sudden enters master with a roar, And kicks the scheming murderer to door. ODE II. Right honest watchdogs of the state, I like to smile at kings, but treason hate— Most busy Jenkinson, Bute's once best friend, A praise that stamps a character divine! Believe not thus, the poet can offend; Ye gods! can Peter pour th' unloyal line? I Peter, perpetrate so foul a thing! I offer mischief to so good a king! Now be it known to all the realms around, I would not lose my liege for twenty pound! Mild Osborne, softer than the down of goose, I beg you will not let suspicion loose— If so—of history I'll turn compiler— Divulge some tame amours with Mistress C?yl?r: So tame, indeed, so singularly stupid, As gave a blush to little pimping Cupid! O Heav'ns! can Jenkinson and Osborne long, Foes to the Muse, to cut out Peter's tongue? Arm'd with the Jove-like thunders of the crown, To knock with those dread bolts a simple poet down? Lo! into life against my will I tumbled, And, says my nurse, I made a horrid clatter; Kick'd, sprawl'd, and sputter'd, gap'd, and cry'd, and grumbled, Quite angry, seemingly, with mother Nature; Who, queen-like, thinking all she does is right, Against my wishes lugg'd me into light; And what is harder, and worse manners still, She'll kick me out of it against my will. Yet since on this world's theatre I'm thrown, Which with my temper now begins to suit; And since its drama pleases, I must own I should be sorry to remain a mute; Inclin'd to say, like Beckford The House of Commons frequently resounded with those emphatic expressions of the late angry patriotic alderman, when gentlemen, by scraping, hemming, coughing, and groaning (to adopt the phraseology of my old friend Dr. Johnson) meant to oppugn the impetuosity of pecuniary arrogance, and annihilate the ebullition of pertinacious loquacity., undeterr'd, ‘By G?? I'll speak, and d?mme I'll be heard.’ My lords, I fain would live a little longer, For lo! desire, as to a bosom wife, Undoubtedly the greatest bliss of life, Hath taken deeper root and stronger. Would He who made the world look down and say, ‘Peter, wilt live on earth a thousand years?’ ‘Lord, Lord,’ I should delighted roar away, ‘Ten thousand, if to thee it meet appears.’ ‘So long! what for?’ the Deity might cry, ‘O great Divinity,’ quoth I, ‘A thousand reasons; principally one, To see the present Prince of Wales, Whom many an aspic tongue assails, Aloft on Britain's envied throne. Where half the monarchs that have sat before Have only sat to eat, and drink, and snore; To damn the credit of the age, And load with folly hist'ry's blushing page.’ And, Jenkinson, should thy hard face behold A George the Fourth upon the throne, Adieu at once thy age of gold; Behold thy hopes of higher honours gone! Then get thyself an earldom quick, quick, quick, For fear of Fortune's wild vagaries; Thus shall thy daughters all, like mushrooms thick, Rise Lady Joans and Madges, Nells and Marys. ODE III. I own I love the prince—his virtues charm— I know the youth receiv'd from heav'n a heart: In friendship's cause I know his bosom warm, That maketh certain folk with wonder start. 'Tis true that from my soul the man I hate, Immers'd in mammon, and by mis'ry got; Who, to complete his dinner, licks his plate, And wishes to have ev'ry thing for nought: Who if he gam'd, the dice would meanly cog; Rob the blind beggar's scrip, and starve his dog— And that there are such wretches near a throne, Degraded nature tells it with a groan. Perdition catch the money-grasping wretch, With hook-like fingers ever on the stretch; Who sighing, vents on Charity a curse, That asks for want a penny from his purse: The heart that lodges in that miser's breast, For money feels the hunger of the shark; Resembling too, the rusty iron chest That holds his idol—close, and hard, and dark. Give me the youth who dares at times unbend, And scorning moderation's prude-like stare, Can to her teeth, and to the world, declare, Ebriety a merit with a friend. When friendship draws the corks, and bids the dome With mirth and sallies of the soul resound: When friendship bids the bowl o'erflowing foam, Till morning eyes the board with plenty crown'd; Behold the virtues that sublimely soar, Instead of meanly damning, cry ‘encore.’ ODE IV. With you, my lords, I'm ev'ry thing that's evil; There's scarce a crime I've not committed; The very essence of the devil; Deserving by the dæmon to be spitted; Just like a turkey, goose, or duck, Prepar'd by Joan the cook to go to fire; So wanton have you both been pleas'd to pluck The swan that imitates his Theban sire. Of ev'ry quality am I bereft, Not ev'n the shadow of a virtue left; Not one small moral feather in my wings, When dead, to lift me to the King of Kings. My lords, beware—by mouthing oft my name Unwisely, you may damn me into fame: By letting thus your spleen on Peter loose, He builds triumphal arches on abuse! In vain the bard turns oculist, and tries To purge the film from this world's darken'd eyes: In vain to printers and to printers' devils I fly, and advertise to cure king's evils: With huge contempt you look on me, alack! My nostrums curse, and call the bard a quack. In general, authors are such coward things, They fear to speak their sentiments of kings, Till those same kings are dead, and then the crowd, Just like a pack of hounds, historian, bard, With throats of thunder run his mem'ry hard, And try to tear him piecemeal from his shroud. Now, if we wish a monarch to reclaim, In God's name let us speak before he's dead, Or else 'tis ten to one we miss our aim, By staying till the fates have cut his thread: After this operation of their knife, I ne'er knew reformation in my life. And yet, what is the greatest king when dead, When dust and worms his eyes and ears o'erspread, And low he lies beneath the stone? The man who millions call'd his own, Howe'er his spectre may be willing, Cannot give change t'ye for a shilling! ODE V. Your taunting voices now, my lords, I hear, And thus they grate the poet's loyal ear: ‘Bard, we are both superior to thy lays— Deaf to thy censure, and despise thy praise. ‘Know that our monarch lifts his head sublime, Beyond the reach of groveling rhime, An Atlas hiding 'midst the thickest clouds; Whilst thou a beetle, doom'd to buz below, In circles, envious rambling to and fro, Survey'st the shining mist his head that shrouds. ‘Thy rhimes, insulting kings with pigmy pride, Are like the sea's mad waves that make a pother, Wild rushing on some promontory's side, One noisy blockhead following another. ‘The stately promontory seems to say, Aspiring fools, go back again, go home: At once the shoulder'd bullies dash'd away, Sink from his stately side in fruitless foam. ‘Thou, with rabscallions like thyself, A poor opiniated elf, Letting on kings thy pen licentious loose, Art like an impudent lane goose, Who, as the trav'ler calmly trots along, Starts from amongst his flock, an ill-bred throng, Waddling with pok'd-out neck, and voice so coarse, As if to swallow up the man and horse: With rumpled feathers to the steed he steals, And, like a coward, snaps him by the heels; Then to his gang, with out-stretch'd pinions hobbling, The fool erect returns te deum gobbling, And from each brother's greeting gullet draws The mingled triumph of a coarse applause, As if the trotting enemies were beaten, And man and palfry kill'd and eaten. ‘Poor rogue, thou hast not got the trifling spirit To own thy king e'er did one act of merit.’ My lords, with great submission to your sense, Giving the lie, yet hoping no offence; An act is his my heart with rapture hails— George gave the world the Prince of Wales; A prince, who when he fills Old England's throne, The virtues and fair science shall surround it; And when he quits the sceptre, all shall own He left it as unsullied as he found it. ODE VI. Great was the bard's desire to sing the queen, Vast in her soul, majestic in her mien; But fierce George Hardinge Solicitor to the Queen. swore if pens or pen Of woman, women, man or men, In any wise or shape, in ode or tale, Dar'd mention that superior lady, lo! The law should deal them such a blow!— Hang, pill'ry, or confine for life in jail! And as a kite, on whom the small birds stare, That tow'ring critic of the air, Is oft beset by tribes of rooks and crows, Amidst the crystal fields of heav'n; By whose hard beaks and wings, no common foes, Sad knocks to gentle kite are giv'n; Surrounded thus amidst that lofty hall, Nam'd Westminster, the gentle bard Might of the sable legions taste the gall: He therefore wisely means to play his card: The poet's quidlibet audendi waves, And thus his hide an old companion saves. Ah me! the legislators of Parnassus, In liberty, though Englishmen, surpass us! What's sound at Hippocrene, the poet's Spa, Is not at Westminster sound law! Parnassus never with rare genius wars; But aiding, lifts his head to strike the stars: At Westminster how diff'rent is his fate? Where if he soars sublime, and boldly sings, The sheers of law, like fate's, shall snip his wings, And bid him warble through an iron grate. Perchaunce law neckcloths, form'd of deal or oak, Like marriage, often an unpleasant yoke, Shall rudely hug his harmless throat, And stop his Apollinian note; The empire of fair poetry o'erturning, And putting every muse in mourning. ODE VII. You tell me both with grievous malice carping, On one dull tune eternally I'm harping— You would have said to Milton just the same; Who through twelve books the head of Satan maul'd— Such names the prince of darkness call'd, As must have made you roar out shame. You would (or greatly I mistake) have said, ‘What! Milton, always plaguing the poor devil, For ever beating Nick about the head; How canst thou be so dev'lishly uncivil? ‘Was not one book sufficient for thy spleen, But must thou to a mummy beat him, And, like a pickpocket, so barb'rous treat him, Through books a dozen or fourteen?’ Suppose these things you could have mutter'd, And glorious Milton, like a ninny, Had answer'd, ‘There is sense and reason in ye— Thank ye, kind gentlemen, for all you've utter'd; The hint you offer not amiss is; I'll tear my Paradise to pieces.’ Suppose I ask you what had been the evil? Believe me, something to the world's sad cost— By such civility to spare the devil, My lords, a second Iliad had been lost. Thus from poor Peter take the great away; Of fun you rob him of cart loads— What would his customers all do and say? P'rhaps, curse you for the loss of odes. You'll say, ‘Let satire meaner subjects look.’ Well, Jenky Here seemeth to be a contradiction; but when the reader is informed that Jenky cannot without mockery be ranked amongst the great, the mystery stands explained., grant my satire flies at you, Who'd buy my melancholy vulgar book?— Adieu fair fame, and fortune's smiles adieu! But if we daring trim a royal jacket, Lord! what a buying, reading, what a racket! How spruce the metamorphos'd bard appears! With what a confidence he pricks his ears? Who just before, in piteous chop-fall'n plight, Look'd of the woful face, La Mancha's Knight! Who runs to see a monkey in a trap? But let the noble lion grace the gin, Lo! the whole world is out to see him snap, To hear him growl, and triumph o'er his grin! Cut off the head of a great lord, Not wiser than the head of a great goose, Tow'r Hill at once with gapers will be stor'd, As if the world was all broke loose; But when a little villain haps to swing, What a poor solitary string! How few by curiosity are fetch'd To see the rope of justice stretch'd! Scarce any but the hangman and the priest To do their duty at the culprit's side, With hemp and pray'rs his neck and soul assist, And wish the lonely trav'ller a good ride. ODE VIII. Hark! hark! I hear yon courtier pair exclaim, ‘This Peter is the most audacious dog; The fellow hath no rev'rence for a name— A king to him is scarce above a log.’ Sometimes below A few foreign monarchs justify the poet's assertion. a log, sirs, if you please; A bold assertion, to be prov'd with ease. But, goodly gentlemen, I do desire ye, T'avoid in this affair minute inquiry Concerning their respective merit; I fear less prudence will be seen than spirit; Logs universally are useful things; A postulatum not allow'd to kings. ‘For us, on Honour's pinnacle,’ you cry, ‘Whose heads are nearly level with the sky, High basking in the blaze of regal pow'r; This Peter, seldom from rank pride exempt, Calls us, with scowling eyes of fix'd contempt, A pair of jackdaws perch'd upon a tow'r. ‘Archbishops, bishops, servants of the Lord, Head servants, too, who preach the purest word, With waving hands enforcing goodly matter, No more by him, the scorner, are accounted, Than sweepers on their chimneys mounted, That wield their brush, and to the vulgar chatter.’ True, my dear lords—for merit only warm, Rank and fine trappings long have ceas'd to charm— And yet, their eyes the stupid million bless, For barely getting sights of rank and dress! When judges a campaigning go, And on their benches look so big, What gives them consequence, I trow, Is nothing but a bushel wig; Yet bumpkins, gaping with a bullock stare, See learning lodg'd in ev'ry hair, But heads, not hair, my admiration draw; Not wigs, but wisdom, strikes my soul with awe. ODE IX. The man who printeth his poetic fits, Into the public's mouth his head commits; Too oft a lion's mouth, of danger full, Or flaming mouth of Phalaris's bull; He pours the sad repentant groan in vain, The cruel world but giggles at his pain. For, lo! our world, so savage in its nature, Would rather see a fellow under water, Or, from the attic story of a house Fall down souse Upon a set of cursed iron spikes; Than see him with the blooming lass he likes, Blest on a yielding bed of down or roses, Where Love's fond couples often join their noses. Upon me what a host I've got! Who by their black abuses boil their pot, Ay, that's the reason—wide-mouth'd hunger calls, And from the bellows of each stomach bawls! Thus the poor silk-worms, born to bless mankind, Whilst for the shiv'ring world the robe they spin, In ev'ry ring a thousand insects find, Gnawing voraciously their harmless skin. And thus the lambs, whose useful fleeces treat With coats and blankets people of all stations, By preying maggots are beset, Harb'ring whole stinking nations; Which from their backs the crows so kindly pick, Enough to make a Christian sick. Oh, would some critic crow but eat the pack Now nestling in my lyric back, That daily in their hosts increase, And try to spoil the finest fleece. Why am I persecuted for my rhimes, That kindly try to cobble kings and times? To mine, Charles Churchill's rage was downright rancour, He was a first-rate man of war to me, Thund'ring amidst a high tempestuous sea; I'm a small cockboat bobbing at an anchor; Playing with patereroes that alarm, Yet scorn to do a bit of harm. My satire's blunt—his boasted a keen edge— A sugar-hammer mine—but his a blacksmith's sledge! And then that Junius!—what a scalping fellow; Who dar'd such treason and sedition bellow! Compar'd to them, whose pleasure 'twas to stab, Lord! I'm a melting medlar to a crab! My humour of a very diff'rent sort is— Their satire's horrid hair cloth, mine is silk— I am a pretty nipperkin of milk; They two enormous jugs of aqua fortis. Compar'd to their high floods of foaming satire My rhime's a rill—a thread of murmuring water: A whirlwind they, that oaks like stubble heaves— I, zephyr, whisp'ring, sporting through the leaves. And such all candid people must conclude it— The world should say of Peter Pindar's strain, ‘In him the courtly Horace lives again— Circum præcordia Petrus ludit.’ Which easy scrap of Latin thus I render— No man by Peter's verse is harshly bitten; Like lambkins bleats the bard so sweet and tender, And playful as the sportive kitten. So chaste his similes, so soft his style, That ev'n his bitt'rest enemies should smile; He biddeth not his verse in thunder roar— His lines perpetual summer—sunshine weather— He tickles only—how can he do more, Whose only instrument's a feather? ODE X. Like children, charm'd with praise's sugar'd song, How much the great admire the cringing throng; And how most lovingly the men they hate, Who to the stubbornness of conscience born, Tenacious of the rights of nature, scorn To hold the censer to the nose of state! Too many a weak-brain'd man, and silly dame, Are made ridiculous by fulsome fame; Rais'd on high pedestals in rich attire, For half the globe to laugh at, not admire. You bid the bard in panegyric shine; With courtly adulation load the line: Sirs, adulation is a fatal thing— Rank poison for a subject, or a king. My lords, I do declare that it requires A brain well fortified to bear great flatt'ries; Such very dangerous mask'd batteries, That keep on great men's brains such ceaseless fires! I hope that God will give such great men grace To know the gen'ral weakness of the place. Pray do not fancy what I utter strange— The love of flatt'ry is the soul's rank mange, Which, though it gives such tickling joys, Instead of doing service, it destroys: Just as the mange to lapdog's skins applied, Though pleasing, spoils the beauty of the hide. A sonnet now and then to please the fair, With flatt'ry spic'd a little, does no harm— That talks of flames, perfections, hope, despair, And hyperbolically paints each charm. P'rhaps to a fault at times, my muse's art, By admiration swell'd, hath soar'd too high; But Cynthia knew the lover's partial art, And chid her poet for the tuneful lie. Perhaps too loud the bard had struck the lyre; And when th' enthusiast, with a lover's fire, More bright than angels, gave the nymph to glow; By Truth's delightful dictates solely sway'd, Ought of his fav'rite Cynthia to have said, ‘She triumphs only o'er the world below.’ ODE XI. My lords, I won't consent to be a bug, To batten in the royal rug, And on the backs of monarchs meanly crawl, And more, my lords, I hope I never shall. Yet certain vermin I can mention, love it, You know the miserables that can prove it, I cannot, Papist-like (a dupe to kings), Create divinities from wooden things. Somewhere in Asia—I forget the place— Ceylon I think it is—Yes, yes, I'm right; There kings are deem'd of heav'nly race, And blasphemy it is their pow'r to slight. Like crouching spaniels down black lords must lie, When'er admitted to the royal eye, And say, whene'er the mighty monarch chats To those black lords about their wives and brats, That happen in the world to tumble; ‘Dread sire your slave and bitch my wife, Hath brought to bless your dog so humble, One, two, three, four, five puppies into life; All subject to your godlike will and pow'r, To hang or drown in half an hour.’ This is too servile, I must dare confess— 'Twixt man and man the diff'rence should be less. I own I brought two wond'ring eyes to town, Got bent by mobs my ribs like any hoop, To see the mighty man who wore a crown— To see the man to whom great courtiers stoop. Much had I read, which certés some time since is, My Bible so replete with kings and princes, And thought kings taller than my parish steeple; I thought too, which was natural enough, Jove made their skins of very diff'rent stuff From that which clothes the bones of common people. But mark! by staring, gaping, ev'ry day, The edge of admiration wore away, Like razors' edges rubb'd against a stone; Kings ceas'd to be such objects of devotion, I saw the beings soon without emotion, And thought like mine their bodies flesh and bone. Like many thousands, I was weak enough To think Jove kept a soul and body shop— Like mercers, had variety of stuff, For such whose turn it was to be made up; And that he treated with great liberality Folks born to figure in the line of quality; Giving souls superfine, and bones and bloods, In short, the choicest of cœlestial goods: But on the lower classes when employ'd, It struck me, that he work'd with much sang froid, Not caring one brass farthing for the chaps; Forming them just as girls themselves amuse In making workbags, pincushions, and shoes— Videlicet—from scraps. Now can't I give a thimblefull of praise, E'en to an emp'ror, if uncrown'd by merit; A starving principle, 'faith now a-days, And unconnected with the courtier's spirit— You, sirs, I think, can give it with a ladle, And rock of grinning idiotism the cradle. ODE XII. So much abus'd, I lose my lyric merit— Evaporated half its spirit; Reduc'd from alcohol to phlegm; From solid pudding to whipp'd cream. There was a time when, not one bit afraid Of aught the people roar'd, or sung, or said; I carelessly my fav'rite trade pursu'd; Invok'd Apollo, and the Muses woo'd: And with the stoicism that sooths a stone, I sat me down and pick'd my mutton bone. Thus when amidst the tumbling world of waves The cloud-wrapt genius of the tempest raves, And midst the hurrying mass of spectr'd gloom, Fate mounted on the wild wing of the blast, Shouts desolation through the twilight waste, And, thund'ring, threats a system's doom; Lo! with light wing a gull the billows sweeps, Sports on the storm, and mocks the bellowing deeps; Now on the mountain surge compos'd he squats, Adjusts his feathers, and looks round for sprats. I now may say with righteous David, ‘Lord, With foes I'm sore encompasssed about;’ And rhime like Sternhold, once for verse ador'd, ‘I wote not when I shall get out; So craftily the heathen me assail, My canticle doth not a whit avail.’ Lo! almost every one at Peter's head Levels his blunderbuss, and takes a pop— Bounce on my dear os frontis falls the lead, But harmless yet, thank God, I've seen it drop Yet by and by some luckless shot May knock about the brains of tuneful Peter— Thousands will smile to see him go to pot, And mock him in his grave with shameless metre: Not so our gracious king and queen, I know it— They've pity, if not pence to give a poet. Patient as Job, when Satan, all so vile, Betting his skin against the Lord's, Adding a most contemptuous smile, As well as most indecent words, Cover'd the man of Uz with boils, At which with horror ev'ry heart recoils: Yes, patient as the man of Uz am I, Though forc'd on envy's burning coals to fry. Seek I the court?—Lords, lordlings fly the place— The ladies, too, so full of loyal grace, Turn their gay backs when there I show my head; As happen'd at St. James's t'other day, When up the stairs I took my solemn way, And fill'd the fine-dress'd gentlefolks with dread. Off Brudenell flew, and with his star so blazing; Off flew the frighten'd Sir John Dick, so stout, Who won his blazing star by means amazing— By manufacturing sour crout. Off flew with this great crout-composing Dick, Thomson and Salisb'ry, Harcourt, and gold-stick: Such was the terror at the man of rhimes, As though he enter'd to divulge their crimes. Thus on a bank upon a summer's day, Of some fair stream of East or Western Ind, When puppies join in wanton play, Free from the slightest fear of being skinn'd; If from that stream, which all so placid flows, A sly old alligator pokes his nose; P'rhaps with a wish to taste a slice of cur; At once the dogs are off upon the spur; Nor once behind them cast a courtly look, To compliment the monarch of the brook. ODE XIII. Deserted in my utmost need by fate, Like fam'd Darius, great and good; Fall'n, fall'n, poor fellow, from a large estate; Forc'd, forc'd to browse, like goats, the lanes for food! Alas! deserted quite by ev'ry friend; And what than friendship can be sweeter; Lo! not a soul will kind assistance lend; Lo! ev'ry puppy lifts his leg at Peter! Like some lone insulated rock am I, Where midst th' Atlantic vast, old Æol raves; Shook by the thunders of each angry sky, And roll'd on by the rushing world of waves. So hard, indeed, the critic tempest blows, I scarce can point against the gale my nose— A storm more violent was never seen! So dread the war!—indeed it must be dread, When from his shop John Nichols pops his head, And pours the thunders of his Magazine. For heavier artill'ry ne'er was play'd:— And yet, not all th' artill'ry is his own; Hayley, a close ally, in ambuscade Behind, assists the war of furious John. John Nichols, with Will Hayley for his 'squire, Are serious things, howe'er the world may laugh— And therefore dread I much to face the fire Of this intrepid Hudibras and Ralph. You too, my lords, combin'd with those dread foes To tear the bard to pieces for his rhimes, Is very cruel, Heav'n well knows, And does no sort of credit to the times. Yet let me feel myself—I'm not yet dead, Though maul'd so terribly about the head; By printer's devils and allies surrounded: P'rhaps, like the Prussian monarch, I may rise Herculean, to the world's surprise, And see my enemies confounded. Full many a cock hath won ten pound, Though seeming dead, stretch'd out amidst the pit— Leap'd up, and giv'n his foe a fatal wound— Then why not mine, ye gods, the lucky hit? ODE XIV. With your good leave, my lords, I'll now take mine, Not deem'd perchaunce, a poet quite divine— Perchaunce with beasts at Ephesus I've warr'd, Like that prodigious orator St. Paul, And for my stanzas, p'rhaps both great and small, You kindly wish me feather'd well and tarr'd. You think I loathe the name of king, no doubt— Indeed, my lords, you never were more out: I am not of that envious class of elves; Though dame M'Auley turns on kings her tail; With great respect the sacred names I hail, That is, of monarchs who respect themselves. But should they act with meanness, or like fools, The muse shall place a fool's cap on their skulls. Stubborn as many a king, indeed, I am— That is, as stubborn as a halter'd ram: A change in Peter's life you must not hope: To try to wash an ass's face, Is really labour to misplace; And really loss of time, as well as sope. ODE XV. Pray let me laugh, my lords, I must, I will— My lords, my laughing muscles can't lie still: Unpolish'd in the supple schools of France, I cannot burst to pleasure complaisance. Care to our coffin adds a nail, no doubt; And ev'ry grin so merry, draws one out: I own I like to laugh, and hate to sigh, And think that risibility was giv'n For human happiness, by gracious Heav'n, And that we came not into life to cry: To wear long faces, just as if our Maker, The God of goodness, was an undertaker, Well pleas'd to wrap the soul's unlucky mien In sorrow's dismal crape or bombasin. Methinks I hear the Lord of nature say, Fools, how you plague me! go, be wise, be gay; No tortures, penances, your God requires— Enjoy, be lively, innocent, adore, And know that Heav'n hath not one angel more In consequence of groaning nuns and friars. Heav'n never took a pleasure or a pride In starving stomachs, or a horsewhipp'd hide. ‘Mirth be your motto—merry be your heart; Good laughs are pleasant inoffensive things; And if their follies happen to divert, I shall not quarrel at a joke on kings.’ ODE XVI. If monarchs (the suggestion, p'rhaps of liars) Turn housebreakers, and rob the nuns and friars; Steal pictures, crucifixes, heav'nly chattels, To purchase swords and guns and souls for battles: In spite of all the world may say or think, If empresses will punk-like kiss and drink: If kings will sell the hares and boars they kill, And snipe and partridge blood for mammon spill, Denying thus themselves a dainty dish, And go themselves to market with their fish: Pleas'd with the vulgar herd to join their name, If kings, ambitious of a blacksmith's fame, Not wondrously ambitious in their views, Instead of mending empires, make horse shoes: Dead to fair science, if to vagrant hogs, To toymen, conjurors, and dancing dogs, Great princes, pleas'd, a patronage extend; Whilst modest genius pines without a friend: Dismissing grandeur as an idle thing, If on bob wigs, slouch'd hats, and thread-bare coats, Upon vulgarity a monarch doats, More pleas'd to look a coachman than a king: If with their bullocks kings delight to battle: On hard horse chesnuts make them dine and sup, Resolv'd to starve the nice-mouth'd cattle Until they eat the chesnuts up; Poor fellows, from the nuts who turn away, And think it dev'lish hard they can't have hay: If kings will mount old houses upon rollers, Converting sober mansions into strollers, Heraclitus's gravity can't bear it— I must laugh out, and all the world must hear it. ODE XVII. Just one word more, my lords, before we part— Do not vow vengeance on the tuneful art; 'Tis very dangerous to attack a poet— Also ridiculous—the end would show it. Though not to write—to read I hear you're able:— Read, then, and learn instruction from a fable. THE PIG AND MAGPIE, A FABLE. COCKING his tail, a saucy prig, A magpie hopp'd upon a pig, To pull some hair, forsooth, to line his nest; And with such ease began the hair attack, As thinking the fee simple of the back Was by himself, and not the pig possest. The boar look'd up as thunder black to Mag, Who, squinting down on him like an arch wag, Inform'd mynheer some bristles must be torn; Then busy went to work, not nicely culling; Got a good handsome beakful by good pulling, And flew, without a ‘Thank ye,’ to his thorn. The pig set up a dismal yelling; Follow'd the robber to his dwelling, Who, like a fool, had built it midst a bramble: In manfully he sallied, full of might, Determin'd to obtain his right, And midst the bushes now began to scramble. He drove the magpie, tore his nest to rags, And, happy on the downfall, pour'd his brags: But ere he from the brambles came, alack! His ears and eyes were miserably torn, His bleeding hide in such a plight forlorn, He could not count ten hairs upon his back. This is a pretty tale my lords, and pat: To folks like you, so clever, verbum sat. A BENEVOLENT EPISTLE TO SYLVANUS URBAN, ALIAS MASTER JOHN NICHOLS, PRINTER, Common-Councilman of Farringdon Ward, And Censor General of Literature: NOT FORGETTING MASTER WILLIAM HAYLEY: To which is added, AN ELEGY TO APOLLO: ALSO SIR. J. BANKS AND THE BOILED FLEAS, AN ODE. How now, pritheee, John Do not quarrel, man, Let us be merry, and Drink about. CATCH. THE ARGUMENT. The Poet commenceth in a sublime Strain of happy Imitation of Classic Simplicity; with the Ille ego—Self-consequence of the Mantuan Bard; giving an Account of the various Themes of his Muse, from Majesty to Mr. John Nichols—He asketh the Reason of John's great Anger, and freeth himself from the Imputation of Illiberality, by telling the World what handsome Things he hath said of the Printer—The Poet attacketh John in Turn for his want of Candour—speaketh Oracles to John —maketh a fine Comparison between himself and purling Streams; also between Curs, Cats, and Courtiers—The Poet declaimeth virtuously and politically against Swearing in a Passion —complaineth of Instances of John's Cruelty towards him for barely administering a few admonitory Lashes to the Back of the President of the Royal Society; Mrs. Piozzi, and Mr. Boswell—The Poet again complaineth of John's disingenuousness; praising at the same Time his own Sweetness of Disposition—he mentioneth the Horrors of dying People at the Thought of being exhibited in John's Magazine, in which the Poet is supposed to allude to the Letters of the Rev. Mr. Badcock and others, as well as scandalous Anecdotes collected from Families, to give a Zest to his monthly Lumber—The Poet informeth John of the Appellation given him by some People— also other People's Idea of a more appropriate Appellation, though a very rude one, and which the Poet was always too delicate to use—the Poet confesseth that he marvelled at John's Impudence in assuming the Management of the Gentleman's Magazine after Dr. Johnson; on which Dr. Johnson the Poet passeth a just Stricture with unprecedented Delicacy—the Poet challengeth John to say he ever exposed him for his Praises of such as contributed to his Magazine—or when he tried to eclipse the biographical Fame of Plutarch, by his Anecdotes of poor old Bowyer—The Poet exhibiteth more Instances of Grandeur of Soul—still more nobleness—still more—The Poet maketh a most luminous Remark on the Difference between the Happiness of Fools and Wise Men, and concludeth with advising John to make a proper Application of his Talents. BENEVOLENT EPISTLE, &amp;c. &amp;c. I, who, ambitious that the brats, my rhimes, Shou'd see the gentlefolks of future times; Rise like antiques in value, nor expire, Till ruin spreads his universal fire: Dread thought! that to destruction must be giv'n This charming world, this handsome work of Heav'n! I, who, regardless of the courtier throng, To kings, and lords, and commons, tun'd the song; Bade Tom Mr. Warton. no more indulge the golden dream, And kindly wish'd his wit a wiser theme; Struck to the lime and mortar knight Sir William Chambers. the string; And hail'd of butterflies the nursing king Sir Joseph Banks., Who scorning suns and moons, with happier eyes, Beholds from dunghills purple emp'rors A rare species of butterfly. rise; More blest on this our earth a frog to see, To find a cockleshell, and boil a flea See the ode at page 103, Than dwell in yonder skies, with glory crown'd, Where frogs, nor fleas, nor cockleshells abound; More blest to mark a bat's than angel's wing; To hear a grasshopper than seraph sing; More pleas'd to view (if rumour justly paints) The tails of tadpoles than the heads of saints; And hear (to fame if credence may be giv'n) One humming-bird than all the host of heav'n: I, who to men of canvass struck the lyre, And set with rhimes th' Academy on fire i. e. produc'd an emulation amongst the ingenious artists—this passage seemed to want an explanation, as an illiberal reader might have imagined that I meant that my academic odes had put the members into a violent passion; an idea so very foreign to my wishes.; O'er Mount Parnassus Jove-like cast my shoe; At poets smil'd, and poetesses too; Preferr'd the ballads of the good Old Bailey, To all the cold pomposities of Hayley, Whose rhimes Such is really the present sunk condition of this ladies' author., as soon as litter'd, join the heaps, Where midst her shadowy gulf oblivion sleeps: So deep, who scarce can dive into himself! So lofty, too, the tenant of the shelf! Now stiffer than recruits so raw at drill; Now petit-maitre of the muse's hill: I, who to grave reviewers sigh'd my pray'r, Submissive bending at the critic chair; And blushing begg'd one little laurel sprig, To bring importance, and adorn my wig: I who Sam Whitbread's brewhouse prais'd in song, So highly honour'd by the royal throng; Berhim'd a goodly monarch and his spouse, Miss Whitbread's curt'sies, Mister Whitbread's bows, Amounting, hist'ry says, to many a score, Such, too, as Chiswell street ne'er saw before; Not e'en forgetting with my classic force The brewer's bulldog, and his marv'ling horse; The curious draymen into puncheons creeping, And charm'd with greatness, through the bungholes peeping; I, who to Pitt the chords in anger struck, Who whelm'd his prince so gracefully with muck; Lycurgus Pitt, whose penetrating eyes Behold the fount of freedom in excise; Whose patriot logic possibly maintains Th' identity of liberty and chains: I who of Leeds and Hawkesb'ry deign'd to sing, The blessed fav'rites of a blessed ????; High on the lab'ring pinions of an ode, Heav'd Brudenell's folly, what a leaden load! Brudenell who bids us all the proverb feel, ‘The largest calves are not the sweetest veal;’ I, who on such rich subjects deign'd to shine, Now tune to once a printer's dev'l the line; But now no more a dev'l—with Atlas mien, The great supporter of a Magazine The Gentleman's, as it is modestly called; to whose gentility Mr. Hayley is a constant contributor, in the way of ingenious rhime and liberal criticism.; No more, no more a dev'l with humble air, But fit companion for our great Lord May'r; How like the worm which crawls at first the earth, But, getting a new coat, disdains its birth; Spreads its gold tissue to the solar ray, And wings o'er trees and tow'rs its airy way! With anger foaming, and of vengeance full, Why belloweth John Nichols like a bull? Say, goddess, could a few poetic stripes Make John, so furious, kick about his types; Spin round his pandemonium like a top, And, thund'ring, to its centre shake the shop? Could satire's twig produce so dire a din? And dwells such softness in a printer's skin? Illib'ral! never, never have I said, That thou wert not an honest man in trade! Whether from principle or jail dismay Springs thy morality, we dare not say: Since jails, those iron agents of the law, Keep many a graceless rogue in pious awe. Yet, son of ink, devoutly let us hope Thou lov'st a virtue more than dreadst a rope; Nay, to thy honour let me this declare, To make the rigid sons of conscience stare, That when thou money lendest, such thy purity, Detesting bad, thou seekest good security. Inclin'd for ever, John, to take thy part, Thus have I pour'd the dictates of my heart: ‘If 'midst a vulgar mass his stars unkind Have plac'd most niggardly a pigmy mind, 'Tis not John's fault—John should not blush for shame, His parsimonious planets are to blame. What though in wisdom's crucible his head Prove that it dealeth less in gold than lead; Unskill'd on classic ground to cut a caper, Yet knoweth John the price of print and paper: His nice discerning knowledge none deny, On crown, imperial, foolscap, and demy. On blanket, sheepskins Necessary for making printers' balls., urine, John can think; Myself would take his sentiments on ink: Myself would take his sentiments on letters: On syllables, indeed, I'd ask his betters. The meanest mortal let us not deride: Lo! beasts of burden oft must be our guide; Yes, through the dark and unknown track, of course, I yield up all opinion to my horse.’ Truth, let fair truth for ever rule my rhimes! I'm told this lady visits thee sometimes! How kind! how humble! thus the god of day Deigns to a mudpool to impart his ray! Amidst the passions' roar, a clam'rous host, Oft is the gentle voice of reason lost! How try'st thou, butcher-like, to carve my work, And treat each sweet-soul'd stanza like a Turk! From such sad readers Heav'n the muse protect, Proud to find fault, and raptur'd with defect! Yet though thou frown'st on Peter's every line, Behold the diff'rence, John!—he smiles on thine. Say not I hate each man of verse and prose; I rev'rence genius, John, where'er it grows: Whene'er it beams through ignorance's night, I mark the stranger with as keen delight, As looks the pilgrim on Bassora's tow'rs, Her streams, ambrosial blooms, and myrtle bow'rs; Who, long denied of hope's sweet cup to taste, Had sigh'd amidst the solitary waste. Blame not the bard, thou man of letter'd pride, Who taking not Dame Prudence for thy guide, Didst stone the poet's mansion like an ass, Forgetting that thy own was made of glass. Know, John, that passion maketh man a swine: Know this, and bid thy conduct copy mine. When deeming me a Saracen in heart, Why, simple John, attempt my road to thwart? Amidst thy walks should bullies meet thine eye, Compos'dly let those bullies pass thee by. To bustling bravoes, for my ease and pride, I give the wall, and smiling turn aside. Thus if a rock or log the stream oppose, That sweetly lambent from its fountain flows; No foamy turbulence the rills betray, But, easy yielding, wind in peace away. My hate of courtiers how thine anger drew! I own I loathe St. James's servile crew: Where'er the smiles of royalty are found, The lazy clan of courtiers crouch around: Thus on the country towns when Phœbus shines; Amidst the radiance ev'ry cur reclines; And lo! neglectful of the mice and rats, Each street presents us with a line of cats. Truth needs not, John, the eloquence of oaths, Not more so than a decent suit of clothes Requires of broad gold lace th' expensive glare, That makes the linsy-woolsy million stare; Besides, a proverb, suited to my wish, Declares that swearing never catcheth fish. 'Tis vulgar—I have said it o'er and o'er; Then keep thy temper, man, and swear no more. Struck, nay, half petrified, that Banks should dare, Indecent fellow! ravish Newton's chair; Mock such as wisdom's sacred mines explore, And kick the arts and sciences to door; Making (methinks a monstrous impropriety) A fly-club of a great and fam'd society: The muse, with virtuous indignation stung, In rhime's strong chains the brazen culprit hung; When with the fury of a thousand foes, Howl'd the wild tempest of thy verse and prose! Shock'd that an idle gossip, Madam Thrale Now Madame Piozzi., And he Mr. James Boswell., a feather genius in thy scale, High panting for the echo of a name, Should meanly crucify poor Johnson's fame; I own I glow'd with more than mortal ire, And fix'd to satire's scourge my sharpest wire; When lo! the poet's visage to begrime, Forth rush'd thy muddy sluice of prose and rhime: For this against my will, indeed with tears, I show'd a grinning land thy ass's ears. Fir'd that the muse should daringly suggest That stars have beam'd upon the blackest breast; Just like their heav'nly cousins all so bright, O'er the dark mantle of old mother night; Should hint (by fortune's wild vagaries plac'd) That crowns may feel themselves at times disgrac'd; To take a king's and courtier's part so prone, Full at my forehead didst thou fling the stone; But thanks to Phœbus, who secur'd my crown, Thou couldst not bring the great Goliah down! Griev'd that th' ambitious muse a prince should praise, Whose name diffuses lustre o'er her lays; A prince whose only fault is want of art, Whose horrid vice, benevolence of heart; Which little abject souls profusion call, And o'er each action vainly spit their gall: Griev'd that the muse attack'd with scorn a man, Unlucky form'd on Nature's hungry plan; Who, lord of millions, trembles for his store, And fears to give a farthing to the poor; Proclaims that penury will be his fate, And, scowling, looks on charity with hate; Whose matchless avarice is meat and drink, That dreads to spill a single drop of ink; On each superfluous letter vents a sigh, And saves the little dot upon an i; Happy e'en Nature's tenderest ties to slight, And vilely rob an offspring of his right; Forth rush'd thy venom—harmless, too, it flow'd, For man defies the poison of a toad; Vex'd that the muse (as if she utter'd treason) Shou'd try to bring poor Boswell back to reason; (Herculean toil, to keep such folly under!) Loud from thy head's dark cloud I felt thy thunder! When mad t'induce the world to deem thee wise, Thou star'dst through spectacles with sapient eyes; Say, did I cry, th' impostor to expose, ‘See John's whole stock of wisdom on his nose!’ Cat-like, because the world my lyrics read, Thine envy claw'd the laurel on my head; Yet claw'd I not again with cat-like spleen, The drooping leaves of thy sad magazine: Touch'd not thy trash, nor Hayley's tinsel stuff; Nor fresh, stale, new antiquities of Gough A maker of antiquities, and one of Sir Joseph Banks's copper-farthing oracles, and constant tea and toast men.: Indeed I'm tender conscienc'd on that score, And learn to look with pity on the poor: No mohawk I, in scenes of horror bred, I scorn to scalp the dying or the dead; Yet well thou knowest that with trifling toil, On satire's gridir'n I cou'd bid thee broil— Turn tuneful butcher, cut thee into quarters, And give thee, John, for one of folly's martyrs. I see thy vanity in all its fulness; The turbot, ven'son of aspiring dulness! And let me, oh! rare epicure, remark, That thou hast got a gullet like a shark. Myself as merciful as man can be, I grieve to find that mercy not in thee. Behold, amidst their short'ning, panting breath, Poor souls! the dying dread thee more than death: ‘Oh! save us from John Nichols!’ is the cry, ‘Let not that death-hunter know where we lie; What in delirium from our lips may fall, Oh! hide—our letters, burn them, burn them all! Oh! let not from the tomb our ghosts complain! O Jesu! we shall soon be up again; Condemn'd, alas! to grin with grisly mien, 'Midst the pale horrors of his magazine: Like felons first in Newgate ballads sung, Then (giv'n to infamy) on Hounslow hung!’ Know, when thou took'st of Aristarch the chair, My eyes expanded only to a stare: Softly, indeed, unto myself I sigh'd, ‘Johnson, thy place is d?mnably supplied The late Dr. Johnson superintended this magazine; a post of honour assumed afterwards by Mr. John Nichols.; Not that I think this idol of the million, Longinus, Aristotle, or Quintilian; Who gives (against sound taste so apt to sin) A pyramid's importance to a pin; On ev'ry theme alike his pompous art, The general conflagration or a f?.’ When into Fame's fair dome, t'insult her throne, So free, as if the house had been thy own, Thou dar'dst to shove a vile conundrum crew, Fellows that Phœbus nor the Muses knew; Speak, did I tell the nation with my pen, How Fame in anger kick'd them out agen; Threw at their heads the lumber of their brains, And call'd thee a pert puppy for thy pains? On such mark'd impudence did I harangue, And give to public scorn the pigmy gang? Short are the hours that smuggled praise can last, An echo, a poor meretricious blast; A sudden gust that bids old ruins stare, And, howling, whirls a feather through the air, Flatt'ry, a little, sly, deceiving lass, With smile resistless, and a front of brass, Shall reign, perchance, the idol of a day; Then, like a batter'd harridan, decay; Whilst Truth, unfading, lifts the head sublime, And dares the formidable test of time. Thou dragon of th' Hesperian fruit, call'd praise, Whose leather-stretching conscience interest sways; Shame, that through sordid avarice and spleen, None taste but such as cram thy magazine. Charm'd as a child whose doating eye regards Its imitation of St. Paul's with cards; When fir'd by Plutarch's venerable name, Whose genius rais'd a pyramid to fame; Thou gav'st of Bowyer's life a gossip's story, And only rear'dst a dunghill to thy glory; I rail'd not at thy infant emulation, Nor spread thy weakness, John, around the nation; Nay, griev'd was I, as all the world can tell, That thou shou'dst write a book that would not sell Unfortunately for poor John, every book that he has published has been possessed of so much of the vis inertiæ as not to be able (if I may use the booksellers' phrase) to move off; witness the Life of old Bowyer, the guttings of old magazines and Ladies' Diaries, called Miscellanies, the Progresses of Queen Elizabeth, editions of trash of every denomination, &amp;c. &amp;c.. When tort'ring the poor gamut wild and loud, Thou scrap'dst harsh discords on thy muse's crowd; What though I stopp'd my ears with all my pow'rs, I mourn'd the labour of thy tuneless hours. Oft have I whisper'd to myself, ‘Enough Of this most tiresome fellow's monthly stuff: A magazine! a pedlar's, huckster's shop, That harbours brush, and cabbage-net, and mop, Pan, gridir'n, button, buckle, bodkin, bead, Tape, turnip, malkins, nightcaps green and red, Pins, pipkins, garters, oatmeal, jorden, dish, Stale loaves, and rusty nails, and stinking fish;’ Yet bade I not the world its laughs prepare, To meet thy miserable monthly ware: Nay, man, I've prais'd thee—for example, said, ‘Lo! in his cumbrous magazine display'd Once in a year a verse to raise our wonder, Which proves that John may make a lucky blunder; How like the heavy mountain, on whose side A daisy starts in solitary pride!’ Lo! from ebriety their sons to save, The Greeks oft show'd the lads a drunken slave: I thus might thee, O gingling John, display, A sad example in the rhiming way For printers and their demons to avoid, Whose labours might more wisely be employ'd; But pity sweetly whispers in my ear, ‘Expose not childhood that deserves a tear; Set not the roaring lion at a rat, Nor call down thunder to destroy a gnat.’ When mad for honours John's ambition to be a common-council-man was violent for a long time; great were the pains used, manifold were the contrivances employed, and prodigious was the interest made for the obtention of this honour—A vacancy happening in Farringdon ward, John's more lucky genius prevailed, and his wishes were gratified; thus is he in the way of being what I have in an ode augured of Mr. Auctioneer Skinner, ‘If things go fair, Proud London's proud lord may'r.’—softly have I said, ‘What imp could put it in the printer's head? Oh! may the fates the maniac over-rule, For titles cannot dignify a fool!’ Complain not that I've wrong'd thy reputation, By calling thee the silliest in the nation; No, John, be comforted—it cannot be; I think I know a few that equal thee. Swear, swear not that I've said, to wound thy fame, That hirelings wrote each work which bears thy name, How false! I know thou wrotest many a line, Lo! all the blunders of the books are thine. A literary jackdaw thou, God wot! Yet by that thievish name I call'd thee not; A carrion crow, that lives upon the dead; Yet hawk-like pounc'd I not upon thy head; A daring coiner, lo! I let thee pass, Nor once impeach'd thy literary brass! Speak—when enamour'd of thy monthly hash, Thou clapp'st another sixpence on thy trash; Once didst thou hear me in a passion roar, ‘Was ever impudence like this before?’ Instead of making in th' affair a fuss, In mild soliloquy I whisper'd thus: ‘How blest the fool! he thinks he all things knows; With joy he wakes, with joy his eyelids close; Pleas'd through the world to spread his own renown, With calm contempt he looks on others down; Self and his own dear works th' eternal theme, His daily idol and his nightly dream; Thrice envied being, whom no tongue can wound, In pride's impenetrable armour bound! How much in happiness beyond the wise, Who view the greatest men with pitying eyes; O'er human imbecility who groan, And sigh to think how little's to be known!’ Oh do not to the Muse's hill resort, Æsop's dull brute The fable of the Gentleman, the Ass, and the Lapdog.!—a bumpkin midst a court: With brother council crack the clumsy joke; Midst beer and brandy, bread and cheese, and smoke; Descend the ladder to the clouds below, Where ordinary men of two pence go; Where vagrant knives and forks are bound in chains, And never tablecloth is spoil'd by stains; Where in the board's black hole (superb design!) Pepper and salt in matrimony join; And in another hole with frown and smile, Much too like marriage, vinegar and oil!— Where for a towel (œconomic thought!) A monstrous mastiff after dinner brought, Complacent waits on gentlemens commands, And yields his back of shag to wipe their hands— Such is the scene where thou shouldst ever sit, Form'd to thy taste, and suited to thy wit— Deal not in hist'ry; often have I said 'Twill prove a most unprofitable trade: Talk not of Painting, for thou know'st her not; Such coy acquaintance will not boil thy pot: Nor make strong love to Music, 'tis a dame Who smiles not on the souls of earth, but flame. Push not thy brain to thought—thou canst not think— From metaphysics should thy genius shrink To thee superior, see the goddess rise, And hide her lofty head amidst the skies? Behold eternal mist her beauties shroud, And 'tis not thy weak eye can pierce the cloud: Curs'd with the common furor of inditing, Yet if thy head possess the mange of writing; Go with biography and cool thy rage, Pen lives that cannot well disgrace thy page; Describe whom ev'ry nobler virtue curses, A Pair who mump with millions in their purses. If loftier subjects thy ambition call, Descant upon the giants of Guildhall. ELEGY TO APOLLO. The Poet complaineth of the Cruelty of Authors, Authoresses, and the Blue-Stocking Club. Great are my enemies in trade, God knows! There's not a poet but would stop my note; With such a world of spite their venom flows, With such good will the knaves would cut my throat. Yet how have I offended, Phœbus, say, To get so much ill blood, such cursing looks? Is it because my more ambitious lay Disdains to visit trunk-makers and cooks? To go with theirs to grocers, and to men Who fortune in that weed tobacco, see; From thence come deeply laden back agen, With sugar, pigtail, pepper, and rappee? The man of words, of stilt-supported phrase, The glist'ring Hayley scorns whate'er I write; This will-o'wisp of verse disdains my lays; Tales, Odes, nor Lousiads yield the least delight! So lofty, yet in ware so humbly dealing! So classically tasteless! big with nought! So tender, yet so destitute of feeling! So sentimental too without a thought? I see the band of Blue-stockings arise, Historic, critic, and poetic dames! This lifts her palms, and that her marv'lling eyes, And squeaks, ‘The fellow's stuff shou'd feel the flames; ‘Such is the way his works should come to light:’ Thus rail those dames of classic erudition; Thus, leagu'd with wit, unmerciful they bite Thy fav'rite bard, O Phœbus, and physician! And now I hear a score in union bawl— ‘In cold contempt shall poor Piozzi sigh? Miss Hannah More into oblivion fall? Dear Mistress Montagu neglected lie? ‘Those rich Corinthian pillars of our club, Sink to the ground so vile, with dust bespread; Whilst he, of motley poetry the Scrub The poet here most fancifully alludeth to Mr. Scrub, the servant of all work, in Farquhar's play of the Beaux Stratagem., Erects, Colossus-like, his brazen head! ‘Oh! let the scullion use his vapid book, Instead of dishclouts when her hands she wipes: Oh! let the kindled leaves assist the cook, And of old washerwomen light the pipes!’ Thus in my condemnation they agree, The mighty cloud-capp'd petticoated wise; Whilst pleas'd (as conscious of the just decree) In proud disdain their snuff-clad noses rise! The misses sad of elegy, my foes, Say my rude genius wants the genuine fire; Bald all my rhimes, my verses measur'd prose, That bears would better touch the Muse's lyre. The riddle and conundrum-mongers cry, ‘Pshaw! d?mn his Lyrics, Lousiads—d?mn 'em all; His strength in fields diarian dares he try? Soon would the Almanac record his fall!’ Thus with dread voice my enemies exclaim! Thus am I doom'd to gulp the bitter pill! Themselves, ‘fair traders of the Mount,’ they name; But me a smuggler on thy sacred hill! God of us lyrics, shall I rouse my rhime, Confound the gang, and vindicate my lay; Or calmly leave them to devouring Time, Who dines upon such wittlings every day? SIR J. BANKS AND THE BOILED FLEAS. A Discontent, mingled with some Grumbling, amongst the more enlightened Members of the Royal Society, on Account of Sir Joseph's non-communication of Wisdom to the royal Journals, spurred the Knight on at last (without the Help of Balaam's Angel) to open his Mouth —He told an intimate Friend that he had made a Discovery that would astonish the World, enrich the Journals, and render himself immortal —with the most important Confidence and philosophic Solemnity, he affirmed that he was upon the very Eve of proving what had never entered the Soul of Man; viz. that Fleas were Lobsters—that Jonas Dryander was ordered to collect fifteen Hundred Fleas, and boil them; which, if they changed to the fine Crimson of the Lobster, would put the Identity of the Species beyond the Possibility of Doubt—at Length the Beds of the President were ransacked by his Flea-crimp honest Jonas—Fifteen Hundred of the hopping Inhabitants were caught, and passed the dreadful Ordeal of boiling Water; with what Success, O gentle Reader, the Ode will inform thee. Blest be the man who thought upon a college, The market of all sorts of knowledge, Th' emporium, as we classic people say: Nay, he upon societies who thought, To learning's stock a deal of treasure brought, Dragging Obscurity so deep to day; Making the dame turn out her bag, Conceal'd beneath her inky cloak; Examining the smallest rag, Black'ned by time's most sacred smoke. To use a simile a little rough, Stripping dame Nature to her very buff; Or to be somewhat more in speech refin'd, By dint of pow'rs of eye and mind, Enlight'ning what through darkness might escape, Embroid'ring thus with silver spangles crape. The mention of societies recalls Of Somerset The Royal Society hold their meetings there. the lofty walls, The hive where fam'd Sir Joseph reigns queen bee; Though men, to whom Sir Joseph is not known, Most certainly must take him for a drone; Whose face by sloven Nature's hard decree, Seems form'd fair ladies' pockets to alarm, Rather than steal fair ladies hearts by charm. Well! so much for Sir Joseph's face, And eke about the hive-like place, Where our Sir Joseph reigns queen bee; And verily queen bee's a proper name, For, reader, know it is a royal dame, Who to her subjects issueth decree: Sendeth her subjects east and west, To pitch on flowers and weeds the best, And bring sweet treasure to the hive; She keepeth, too of gentlemen a band, To say soft things and flatter, kiss her hand, Who eat the honey for such deeds, and thrive. Sir Joseph has his flatt'rers, too, in hand, Who say soft things—yea, very soft indeed, For which the gentle flatt'ring band Gain butter'd toast, sweet flatt'ry's oily meed. A girl for novelty where'er it lies, In mosses, fleas, or cockle-shells, or flies, Sir Joseph ever seeks for something new; Of this, whene'er he sits, he gravely talks, Or whilst he eats, or drinks, or runs, or walks, Amidst his royal and attendant crew. One morning at his house in Soho Square, As with a solemn awe-inspiring air, Amidst some royal sycophants he sat; Most manfully their masticators using, Most pleasantly their greasy mouths amusing, With coffee, butter'd toast, and birds'-nest chat; In Jonas Dryander, the fav'rite, came, Who manufactures all Sir Joseph's fame— ‘What luck?’ Sir Joseph bawl'd—‘say, Jonas say.’ ‘I've boil'd just fifteen hundred’—Jonas whin'd— The dev'l a one change colour could I find’— Intelligence creating dire dismay! Then Jonas curs'd, with many a wicked wish, Then show'd the stubborn fleas upon a dish. ‘How!’ roar'd the President, and backward fell— ‘There goes, then, my hypothesis to hell!’ And now his head in deep despair he shook; Now clos'd his eyes, and now upon his breast, He mutt'ring dropp'd his sable beard unblest; Now twirl'd his thumbs, and groan'd with piteous look. Dead-struck sat Aubert, Blagdon, Planta, Woide, Whose jaw-bones in the mumbling trade employ'd, Half open'd, gap'd, in sudden stupor lost; Whilst from the mouth of ev'ry gaping man, In mazy rill the cream-clad coffee ran, Supporting dainty bits of butter'd toast. Now gaining speech, the parasitic croud Leap'd up and roar'd in unison aloud: ‘Heav'ns! what's the matter! dear Sir Joseph, pray?’ Dumb to their questions the great man ramain'd; The knight, deep pond'ring, nought vouchsaf'd to say; Again the gentlemen their voices strain'd; Sudden the President of Flies, so sad, Strides round the room with disappointment mad, Whilst ev'ry eye enlarg'd with wonder rolls; And now his head against the wainscot leaning, ‘Since you must know, must know (he sigh'd) the meaning, Fleas are not lobsters, d?mn their souls The author would not have so frequently taken the liberty of putting vulgarisms into the worthy President's mouth, had he not previously known that Sir Joseph was the most accomplished swearer of the Royal Society..’ A ROWLAND FOR AN OLIVER, OR A POETICAL ANSWER TO THE BENEVOLENT EPISTLE OF MR. PETER PINDAR. ALSO THE MANUSCRIPT ODES, SONGS, LETTERS, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the above Mr. Peter Pindar, NOW FIRST PUBLISHED BY SYLVANUS URBAN.

A POETICAL ANSWER, &amp;c O son of wicked Satan, with a soul Hot as his hell, and blacker than his coal! Thou false, thou foul-mouth'd cens'rer of the times, I do not care three straws for all thy rhimes. Thy wit is blunter than old worn-out sheers:— I'll make a riddle with thee for thy ears; Write any sort of verse, thou blust'ring blade! Egad! I'll say, like Kecksy, ‘Who's afraid?’— Thank God, I've talk'd to greater folks than thee: In that I will not yield to any he; No, not to any he that wears a head— Again I'll say, like Kecksy, ‘Who's afraid?’— Thank God, whene'er I wish like kings to fare, I go, unask'd, and dine with my lord may'r. But thou, who asks thee, varlet! to their houses? Fear'd by the husbands, dreaded by the spouses. May God Almighty hear what now I speak!— Some aldermen would gladly break thy neck. Thou tell'st us thou hast struck thy lyre to kings— Yes, faith, and sounded very pretty things. Thou blockhead, thou pretend to think thy rhimes Shall live to see the days of after-times. Fool, to pretend on subjects great to shine, Or e'en to printers' dev'ls to tune the line! Sir, let me humbly beg you to be civil— Thou know'st not that I was a printer's dev'l: So, sir, your satire wants the pow'r to drub, In thus comparing Nichols to a grub. Whate'er thou say'st, I'm not of vengeance full, Nor did I ever bellow like a bull: And grant I am a bull, I sha'nt suppose A cur like thee can nail me by the nose. Thou liest when thou sayest, like a top, With anger rais'd, I spinn'd about my shop: Nor did I ever, madden'd by thy stripes, Thou prince of liars, kick about my types. Books have I written; books I still will write, And give, I hope, to gentlefolks delight: With charming print, and copper-plates so fine, Whose magazine goes off so well as mine? Who, pray, like me, the page so fond of filling? Who gives more curious matter for a shilling? England's first geniuses I keep in pay; Much prose I buy, and many a poet's lay: The silk-worm Hayley spins me heaps of verse, And Gough, antiquities exceeding scarce: Great Horace Walpole too, with sweet good-will, Sends me choice anecdotes from Strawb'ry-hill: Miss Seward, Mistress Yeardsley, and Miss More, Of lines (dear women!) send me many a score. These are the nymphs at whom thine envy rails— Fool! of their gowns not fit to hold the tails— These are the men, of prose and verse the knights, With genius flashing, like the northern lights; These are the men whose works immortal show The men of literature from top to toe.— But thou'rt a wen,—a blue, black, bloated tumour, Without one single grain of wit or humour: Thy Muse too all so consequential struts, As if all Helicon were in her guts;— A fish-drab, a poor, nasty, ragged thing, Who never dipp'd her muzzle in the spring. Thou think'st thyself on Pegasus so steady; But, Peter, thou art mounted on a Neddy: Or, in the London phrase,—thou Dev'nshire monkey, Thy Pegasus is nothing but a donkey. I own, my vanity it well may raise, To find so many gaping for my praise; Who send such flatt'ring things as ne'er were seen, To get well varnish'd in my Magazine: Indeed I often do indulge the elves, And suffer authors to commend themselves; Wits of themselves can write with happiest spirit, And men are judges of their proper merit. Lumps have I giv'n them too of beef and pudding, That helps a hungry genius in its studying; And humming porter, when their Muse was dry— For this be glory unto God on high! And not to me, who did not make the pudding, Nor beef assisting genius in its studying. To authors, yes, I've giv'n both boil'd and roast, And many a time a tankard with a toast— But God forbid, indeed, that I should boast! And halfpence too, and sixpences, ecod! But boast avaunt!—the glory be to God! To bards, good shoes and stockings I have giv'n— But not to me the glory, but to Heav'n! Yes, yes, I see how much it swells thy spleen, That I'm head master of the Magazine; Who let no author see the house of Fame, Before he gets the passport in my name. Art thou a doctor? Yes of thinning skill; For thousands have been poison'd by thy pill. But let my soul be calm:—it shan't be said I fear thee, O thou monster!—‘Who's afraid?’ What though I know small Latin, and less Greek, Good sterling English I can write and speak: Yet thousands, who presume to be my betters, Can't spell their names, and scarcely know their letters. Belike, the curious world would hear with joy What trade I was design'd for when a boy? ‘A barber, or a tailor,’ said my mother— ‘No,’ cried my father, ‘neither one nor t'other; A soldier, a rough soldier, John shall wander, Pull down the French, and fight like Alexander.’ But unto letters was I always squinting, So ask'd my daddy's leave to study printing; And got myself to uncle Bowyer's shop, Where, when it pleas'd the Lord that he should drop, The trade and good-will of the shop was mine: Where, without vanity, I think I shine; And where, thank God, in spite of dull abuse, I'm warm, and married, and can boil my goose. And had I been to swords and muskets bred, P'rhaps I had shin'd a Cæsar, or a Swede: Hadst thou a soldier been, thou sorry mummer, Thy rank had never rose above a drummer. How dar'st thou say, that should his Royal Highness. (A prince renown'd for modesty and shyness) Be generalissimo of all our forces, A jack-ass's old back, and not a horse's, Should carry the good prince into the field, Whose arm a broomstick, for a staff, should wield, That very, very broomstick which his wife Oft us'd to finish matrimonial strife? Why dost not praise the virtues of the ?????, As great in soul, as noble in her mien, Whose virtues make the soul of Envy sick, Strong as her snuff, and as her di'monds thick?— But wherefore this to Peter do I say? Owls love the dark, and therefore loath the day.— The ????, as wise a man as man can be; The ?????, so mild, who cannot kill a flea! Brave Glo'ster's Highness, and his sober wife, Who lead the softest, sweetest, calmest life; Richmond and Leeds, each duke a first-rate star, One fam'd for politics, and one for war; The open Hawksb'ry, stranger to all guile, Who never of a sixpence robb'd our isle: The modest Pitt, the Joseph of the day, Who never with lew'd women went astray; And many others, that I soon could mention, Are much oblig'd, indeed, to thy invention! But where's the oak that never feels a blast? Or sun, at times, that is not overcast? Alas! ev'n people drest in gold and ermine May feel at times the bites of nasty vermin: And when thou dar'st great quality attack, What art thou but a bug upon its back? What harm, pray, hath my friend Sir Joseph done, So good, and yet the subject of thy fun? Just in his ways to women and to men— Indeed he swears a little now and then. Behold, his breakfasts shine with reputation! His dinners are the wonder of the nation! With these he treats both commoners and quality, Who praise, where'er they go, his hospitality: Ev'n from the north and south, and west and east, Men send him shell, and butterfly, and beast. Sir William Hamilton sends gods and mugs; And, for his feast a sow's most dainty dugs. And shall such mob as thou, not worth a groat, Dare pick a hole in such a great man's coat? Whenever at St. James's he is seen, Is not he spoke to by the king and queen? And don't the lords at once about him press, And, like his sov'reigns, much regard profess? Tell him they'll come one day to him, and dine, Behold his rarities, and taste his wine? Such are the honours, to delight the soul, On which thy longing eyeballs vainly roll: Such are the honours that his heart must flatter, On which thy old dog's mouth in vain may water. Whether in Dev'nshire thou hast got a house, I value not three capers of a louse; Whether in Cornwall thou a house hast got, And at elections only, boil'st thy pot; Whether a doctor, devil, or a friar, I know not—but I know thou art a liar. Whene'er I die, I hope that I shall read This honest epitaph upon my head:— ‘Here lies John's body; but his soul is seen In that fam'd work, the Ge'mman's Magazine: Brave, yet possess'd of all the softer feelings; Successful with the Muses in his dealings; Mild, yet in virtue's cause as quick as tinder— Who never car'd one f? for Peter Pindar.’ PETER's APOLOGY.Mr. Peter Pindar's Apology for the variety of entertainment in his pretty poetical Olio, is the first thing I shall present to the public. Ladies, I keep a rhime-shop—mine's a trade; I sell to old and young, to man and maid: All customers must be oblig'd; and no man Wishes more universally to please; I'd really crawl upon my hands and knees, T'oblige—particularly lovely woman. Yet some (the Devil take such virtuous times), Fastidious, pick a quarrel with my rhimes, And beg I'd only deal in love-sick sonnet— How easy to bid others cease to feed! On beauty I can quickly die indeed, But, trust me, can't live long upon it. If there is not a deal of impudent double entendre in this sonnet, I do not know what purity meaneth —sweetly wrapped up, indeed, 'Squire Pindar! Instead of a formal commentary on every composition, I shall make short work with them, by giving them their true character in a few words, as for example: Impudence, egotism, and conceit. ODE TO MY BARN.The expulsion of a most excellent set of players from Kingsbridge in Devonshire, with the asylum offered them by the Author's Barn in an adjoining parish, is the foundation of the following Ode. Sweet haunt of solitude and rats, Mice, tuneful owls, and purring cats; Who, whilst we mortals sleep, the gloom pervade, And wish not for the sun's all-seeing eye, Your mousing mysteries to spy; Blest, like philosophers, amidst the shade; When Persecution, with an iron hand, Dar'd drive the moral-menders from the land, Call'd players,—friendly to the wand'ring crew, Thine eye with tears survey'd the mighty wrong, Thine open arms receiv'd the mournful throng— Kings without shirts, and queens with half a shoe. Alas! what dangers gloom'd of late around— Monarchs and queens with halters nearly bound— Duke, dukeling, princess, prince, consign'd to jail! And, what the very soul of Pity shocks, The poor old Lear was threat'ned with the stocks, Cordelia with the cart's unfeeling tail. Still cherish such rare royalty forlorn— A Garrick in thy bosom may be born, A Siddons too, of future fair renown: For Love is not a squeamish god, they say; As pleas'd to see his rites perform'd on hay, As on the goose's soft and yielding down. The same impudence, egotism, and conceit, as in the first Ode. TO MY BARN. By Lacedæmon men attack'd, When Thebes, in days of yore, was sack'd, And nought the fury of the troops could hinder; What's true, yet marv'lous to rehearse, So well the common soldiers relish'd verse, They scorn'd to burn the dwelling-house of Pindar. With awe did Alexander view The house of my great cousin too, And, gazing on the building, thus he sigh'd— ‘General Parmenio, mark that house before ye! That lodging tells a melancholy story: There Pindar liv'd (great bard!) and there he died. ‘The king of Syracuse, all nations know it, Was celebrated by this lofty poet, And made immortal by his strains: Ah! could I find like him a bard to sing me; Would any man, like him, a poet bring me; I'd give him a good pension for his pains. ‘But, ah! Parmenio, 'mongst the sons of men, This world will never see his like agen; The greatest bard that ever breath'd is dead! General Parmenio, what think you?’— ‘Indeed 'tis true, my liege, 'tis very true,’ Parmenio cry'd, and, sighing, shook his head: Then from his pocket took a knife so nice, With which he chipp'd his cheese and onions, And from a rafter cut a handsome slice, To make rare toothpicks for the Macedonians; Just like the toothpicks which we see At Stratford made, from Shakspeare's mulb'ry-tree. What pity that the 'squire and knight Knew not to prophesy as well as fight; Then had they known the future men of metre; Then had the general and the monarch spied, In Fate's fair book, our nation's equal pride, That very Pindar's Cousin Peter! Daughter of thatch, and stone, and mud, When I, no longer flesh and blood, Shall join of lyric bands some half a dozen; Meed of high worth, and, 'midst th' Elysian plains, To Horace and Alcæus read my strains, Anacreon, Sappho, and my great old Cousin; On thee shall rising generations stare, That come to Kingsbridge and to Dodbrook fair Held annually at those places.: For such thy history, and mine shall learn; Like Alexander shall they ev'ry one Heave the deep sigh, and say, ‘Since Peter's gone, With rev'rence let us look upon his Barn.’ ODE TO AFFECTATION.The following Ode of Mr. Pindar's is what rhetoricians would call ironical. The leading feature seems to be impudence. Nymph of the mincing mouth, and languid eye, And lisping tongue so soft, and head awry, And flutt'ring heart, of leaves of aspen made; Who were thy parents, blushful virgin? say— Perchance Dame Folly gave thee to the day, With Gaffer Ignorance's aid. Say, virgin, where dost thou delight to dwell? With maids of honour, startful virgin? tell— For I have heard a deal of each fair Miss; How wicked lords have whisper'd wicked things Beneath the noses of good queens and kings, And sigh'd for pleasures far beyond a kiss! Great is thy delicacy, dainty maid; At slightest things, thy cheek with crimson glows. Say art thou not asham'd, abash'd, afraid, Whene'er thou stealest forth to pluck a rose? Or hast thou lost, O nymph, thy pretty gall; So never pluckest any rose at all? I'm told, thou keepest not a single male; Nothing but females, at thy board to cram; That no he-lapdog near thee wags his tail, Nor cat by vulgar people call'd a ram. I've heard too, that if e'er, by dire mishap, Some ravishers should make thy fav'rites wh?s, Staring as stricken by a thunder-clap, Thy modesty hath kick'd them out of doors. 'Tis said, when wagtails thou behold'st, and doves, And sparrow, busy with their feather'd loves; Lord! thou hast trembled at their wicked tricks; And snatching up thy blush-concealing fan, As if it were a lady and a man, Hast only peep'd upon them through the sticks. And yet so variously thou'rt said to act, That I have heard it utter'd for a fact, That often on old Thames's sunny banks, Where striplings swim, with wanton pranks, On bladders some outstretch'd, and some on corks, Thou squinting, most indiff'rent girl art seen, In contemplation of each youthful skin, Admiring God Almighty's handy-works. Prim nymph, thou art no fav'rite with the world: I hear the direst curses on thee hurl'd! Sorry am I, so ill thy manners suit: 'Tis said, that if a mouse appear to view, We hear a formidable screech ensue, As if some huge devouring brute; And if beneath thy petticoat he run, Thou bellowest as if thou wert undone, And kickest at a cow-like rate, poor soul; When, if thou wert to be a little quiet, And not disturb the nibbler by a riot, The mouse would go into his proper hole. I've heard it sworn to, nymph, that in the streets, When running, dancing, capering at thy side, Thy Chloe other dogs so brazen meets, That, wriggling, ask thy bitch to be their bride; Quick hast thou caught up Chloe in thy arms, From violation to preserve her charms; And, bouncing wildly from the view Of those same saucy canine crew, Hast op'd so loud and tunefully thy throat (Seeming as thou hadst learnt to scream by note), Loud as the Sabine girls that tried to 'scape The speechless horrors of a Roman rape. No novels readest thou, O nymph, in sight; And yet again I'm told that ev'ry night, In secret, thou art much inclin'd to doat On rhimes that Rochester so warmly wrote. Oft dost thou wonder how thy sex, so sweet, Can fellows, those great two-legg'd monsters, meet, And swoon not at each Caliban; And wonder how thy sex can fancy blisses Contain'd within the black rough-bearded kisses Of such a bear-like thing as man. 'Tis also said, that if a flea at night, Pert rogue, hath dar'd thy luscious lip to bite, Or point his snout into thy snowy breast, At once the house hath been alarm'd—the maids Call'd idle, nasty, good-for-nothing jades; Who, Eve-like, rushing to thy room undrest, Have thought some wicked ravisher so dread, On Love's delicious viands to be fed, Had seiz'd thee, to obtain forbidden joys; Which had he done, a most audacious thief, Of ev'ry maid it was the firm belief Thou wouldst not, nymph, have made a greater noise. And yet 'tis said, again, O nymph so bright, Thou sleep'st with John the coachman ev'ry night— Vile tales! invented to destroy thy fame; For wert thou, fearful lass, this instant married, At night thy modest cheek would burn with shame, Nor wouldst thou go, but to the bed be carried: There, when thy Strephon rush'd, in white array'd, To clasp with kisses sweet his white-stol'd maid, And riot in the luxury of charms; Flat as a flounder, seeing, hearing gone— Mute as a fish, and fairly turn'd to stone— O damsel! thou wouldst die within his arms. TO FORTUNE.More impudence, with a lick at one of the Ten Commandments. Ah! loit'ring Fortune, thou art come too late: Ah! wherefore give me not thy smiles before; When all my youthful passions in a roar, Rare hunters, fearless leap'd each five-bar gate? Unknown by thee, how often did I meet The loveliest forms of nature in the street, The fair, the black, and lasting brown! And, whilst their charms enraptur'd I survey'd, This pretty legend on their lips I read— ‘Kisses, O gentle shepherd, for a crown.’ How oft I look'd, and sigh'd, and look'd agen, Upon the charms of ev'ry Phillis! How wish'd myself a cock, and her a hen, To crop at once her roses and her lilies! Indeed not only without paying— But for her liberty without once staying. ‘At Otaheité,’ I have said with tears, ‘No gentleman a jail so horrid fears For taking liberties with lasses: Soon as they heard how love in England far'd, The glorious Otaheitans all were scar'd, And call'd us Englismen a pack of asses.— ‘But they, indeed, are heathens—have no souls But such as must be fried on burning coals. But I'm a Christian, and abhor a rape: Yet if a lass would sell her lean and fat, I'm not so great an enemy to that— Though that might whelp a little kind of scrape; Since 'tis believ'd that simple fornication, May step between a man and his salvation.’ Damn'd Fortune! thus to make me groan! To offer now thy shining pieces— For now my passions are all flown, Gone to my nephews and my nieces. ODE TO MADAM SCHW?G &amp; CO. On their intended Voyage to Germany. Written in the Year 1789. We wish you a good voyage to that shore Where all your friends are impudent and poor. Oblige us, madam—don't again come over— To use a cant phrase, we've been finely fobb'd, Indeed have very dext'rously been robb'd— You've liv'd just eight and twenty years in clover. Pray let us breathe a little—be so good— We cannot spare such quantities of blood; At least for some ten years, pray cross the main; Then, cruel, should you think upon returning, To put us Britons all in second mourning, We may support phlebotomy again. To you and your lean gang we owe th' Excise: Pitt cannot any other scheme devise, To pay the nation's debt, and fill your purses. With great respects I here assure you, ma'am, Your name our common people loudly damn; Genteeler folks attack with silent curses. Madam, can you speak Latin?—No, not much— I think you principally spew The author thinks this expression, though a dirty one, more descriptive than any other of the guttural German; and therefore chooses not to sacrifice truth to a little bienseance. High Dutch: But did you Latin understand (God bless it), I'd offer up the pithiest, prettiest line, Unto your Avarice's sacred shrine— ‘Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit.’ The which translation of this Latin line Is this—‘Alas! that maw profound of thine May like the stomach of a whale be reckon'd: Throw into it the nation's treasury, But for a minute it will pleasure ye; That gullet will be gaping for a second.’ Madam, we wish you a long, long, adieu— Good riddance of the snuff and di'mond crew! Your absence, all, alone the state relieves; For, hungry ladies, as I'm here alive, A house can never hope to thrive, That harboureth a nest of thieves. ODE.An insupportable Apology for keeping Mistresses, and a Laugh at that most respectable state, Matrimony. That I have often been in love, deep love, A hundred doleful ditties plainly prove, By marriage never have I been disjointed; For matrimony deals prodigious blows: And yet for this same stormy state, God knows, I've groan'd—and, thank my stars, been disappointed. With love's dear passion will I never war; Let ev'ry man for ever be in love, Ev'n if he beats, in age, old Parr: 'Tis for his chilly veins a good warm glove; It bids the blood with brisker motion start, Thawing time's icicles around his heart. Wedlock's a saucy, sad, familiar state, Where folks are very apt to scold and hate: Love keeps a modest distance, is divine, Obliging, and says ev'ry thing that's fine. Love writes sweet sonnets, deals in tender matter; Marriage, in epigram so keen, and satire, Love seeketh always to oblige the fair; Full of kind wishes, and exalted hope: Marriage desires to see her in the air, Suspended, at the bottom of a rope. Love wishes, in the vale or on the down, To give his dear, dear idol a green gown: Marriage, the brute, so snappish and ill bred, Can kick his sighing turtle out of bed; Turns bluffly from the charms that taste adores, Then pulls his night-cap o'er his eyes, and snores. Wedlock at first, indeed, is vastly pleasant; A very showy bird, a fine cock-pheasant: By time, it changeth to a diff'rent fowl; Sometime a cuckow, oft'ner a horn-owl. Wedlock's a lock, however large and thick, Which every rascal has a key to pick. O love! for heav'ns sake, never leave my heart: No! thou and I will never, never part— Go, wedlock, to the men of leaden brains, Who hate variety, and sigh for chains.A bare-faced Apology for leaving a loving Wife. TO CHLOE.An Apology for going into the Country. Chloe, we must not always be in heav'n, For ever toying, ogling, kissing, billing; The joys for which I thousands would have giv'n, Will presently be scarcely worth a shilling. Thy neck is fairer than the Alpine snows, And, sweetly swelling, beats the down of doves; Thy cheek of health, a rival to the rose; Thy pouting lips, the throne of all the loves! Yet, though thus beautiful beyond expression, That beauty fadeth by too much possession. Economy in love is peace to nature, Much like economy in worldly matter: We should be prudent, never live too fast; Profusion will not, cannot always last. Lovers are really spendthrifts—'tis a shame— Nothing their thoughtless, wild career can tame, Till pen'ry stares them in th' face; And when they find an empty purse, Grown calmer, wiser, how the fault they curse, And, limping, look with such a sneaking grace! Job's war-horse fierce, his neck with thunder hung, Sunk to an humble hack that carries dung. Smell to the queen of flowers, the fragrant rose— Smell twenty times—and then my dear, thy nose Will tell thee (not so much for scent athirst) The twentieth drank less flavour than the first. Love, doubtless, is the sweetest of all fellows; Yet often should the little God retire— Absence, dear Chloe, is a pair of bellows, That keeps alive the sacred fire. ODE TO LAIS.In the same impudently ironical style. O nymph with all the luxury of skin, Pea-bloom breath, and dimpled chin; Rose cheek, and eyes that beat the blackest sloe; With flaxen ringlets thy soft bosom shading, So white, so plump, so lusciously-persuading; And lips that none but mouths of cherubs know! Oh, leering, lure me not to Charlotte-street, That too, too fair, seducing form to meet; Warm, unattir'd, and breathing rich delight; Where thou wilt practise ev'ry roguish art, To bid my spirits all unbridled start, Run off with me full tilt, and steal my sight. Then shall I trembling fall, for want of grace, And die perhaps upon my face! Ah! cease to turn, and leer, and smile, My too imprudent senses to beguile! Ah! keep that leg so taper from me, Ah! form'd to foil a Phidias's art; So much unlike that leg in ev'ry part By me abhorr'd—and christ'ned gummy. In vain I turn around to run away: Thine eyes, those basilisks, command my stay; Whilst through its gauze thy snowy bosom peeping Seems to that rogue interpreter, my eye, To heave a soft, desponding, tender sigh— Like gossamer, my thoughts of goodness sweeping. Pity my dear religion's dread debility, And hide those orbs of sweet inflammability!— Abound, I say, abound in grace, my feet; And do not follow her to Charlotte-street. Alas! alas! you have no grace, I see, But wish to carry off poor struggling me; Yes, the wild bed of beauty wish to seek!— Yet, if you do—to make your two hearts ake, A sweet, a sweet revenge I mean to take; For, curse me if you shall not stay a week. But let me not thus pond'ring, gaping, stand— But, lo, I am not at my own command: Bed, bosom, kiss, embraces, storm my brains, And, lawless tyrants, bind my will in chains. O lovely lass! too pow'rful are thy charms, And fascination dwells within thy arms. The passions join the fierce invading host; And I and virtue are o'erwhelm'd and lost— Passions that in a martingale should move; Wild horses loosen'd by the hands of Love. I'm off—alas! unworthy to be seen— The bard, and Virtue a poor captive queen! O Lais, should our deeds to sins amount, Just Heav'n will place them all to thy account. A CONSOLATORY STANZA TO LADY MOUNT E?, On the Death of her Pig Cupid.The following Stanza, on the death of Lady Mount E?'s favourite Pig Cupid, is verily exceeded by nothing in the annals of impertinence. O dry that tear, so round and big; Nor waste in sighs your precious wind! Death only takes a single pig— Your lord and son are still behind. TO MR. J. NICHOLS, On his History of the Progresses of Queen Elizabeth.Superlatively impudent, and, I hope, untrue; sent to me two days after my publication of my Queen Elizabeth's Progresses, one of which is now actually in his Majesty's glorious library, at Buckingham-house. John, though it asks no subtilty of brain To write Queen Bess's progress through the land; Excuse the freedom, if, I dare maintain The theme too high for thee to take in hand. On Vanity's damn'd rock what thousands split! Thou shouldst have labour'd on some humbler matter— On somewhat on a level with thy wit— For instance—when her majesty made w?. TO DELIA.To show that I can be candid, even to people of no candour, I shall conclude this first part with a few Songs that are not totally destitute of merit. Whilst poets pour their happiest lays, And call thee ev'ry thing divine; Not quite so lavish in thy praise, To censure be the province mine. Though born with talents to surprise, Thou seldom dost those pow'rs display: Thus seem they trifling in thy eyes; Thus Heav'n's best gifts are thrown away. Though rich in charms, thou know'st it not; Such is thine ignorance profound: And then such cruelty thy lot, Thy sweetest smile inflicts a wound. TO FORTUNE. Yes, Fortune, I have sought thee long, Invok'd thee oft, in prose and song; Through half Old England woo'd thee: Through seas of danger, Indian lands, Through Afric's howling, burning sands: But, ah! in vain pursued thee! Now, Fortune, thou wouldst fain be kind; And now I'll plainly speak my mind— I care not straws about thee: For Delia's hand alone I toil'd; Unbrib'd by wealth, the nymph has smil'd; And bliss is ours without thee. TO CHLOE. Chloe, a thousand charms are thine, That give my heart the constant sigh! Ah! wherefore let thy poet pine, Who canst with ease his wants supply? Oh haste, thy charity display; With little I'll contented be: The kisses which thou throw'st away Upon thy dog, will do for me. TO A FRIEND IN DISGRACE. I cannot, however, conclude this first part of Mr. Peter's lucubrations without a severe reprehension of his want of loyalty, as well as want of respect, for that first of courts, St. James's; and moreover, to prove that disloyalty and disrespect, I give the following Ode, which he, with all his impudence, dares not deny that he wrote. I suppose that it was written in the last reign, since it is impossible that it should be in the present. So then, thy sov'reign turns away his face! Thank God, with all thy soul, for the disgrace. This instant down upon thy knee, And idolize the man who makes thee free; No more endeavour Folly's hand to kiss: At first I look'd with pity on thy state; But now I humbly thank the foot of Fate, That kindly kicks thee into bliss. I've been disgrac'd too—felt a monarch's frown, And consequently quitted town:— But have my fields refus'd their smiles so sweet? Say, have my birds grown sulky with the king? My thrushes, linnets, larks, refus'd to sing? My winding brooks to prattle at my feet? No! no such matter!—Each unclouded day On dove-like pinions gayly glides away: In short, all nature seems dispos'd to please— Then prithee quit thy qualms; look up and laugh; The rural pleasures let us largely quaff, And make our congé to the gods of ease. By day, shall Nature's simple voice Our walks, and rides of health rejoice, Far from an empty court where tumult howls; And should at night, by chance, an hour Be with ennui inclin'd to low'r, We'll go and listen to our owls; Birds from whose throats 'tis said that wisdom springs— How very diff'rent from the throats of kings! ADVICE TO THE FUTURE LAUREAT, AN ODE. Nil nimium studeo, Cæsar, tibi velle placere; Nec scire utrum sis albus an ater homo. CATULLUS. So little, Cæsar's humour claims my care, I know not if the man be black or fair. THE ARGUMENT. The Poet expresseth wonderful Curiosity for knowing the future Laureat—reporteth the Candidates for the sublime Office of Poetical Trumpeter—recommendeth to his Muse the Praises of Economy, Poultry, Cow-Pens, Pigs, Dunghills, &amp;c.—adviseth the Mention of his present Money-loving Majesty of Naples; also of the great people of Germany.—Peter gently criticiseth poor Thomas, and uttereth strange Things of Courts—he exclaimeth suddenly, and boasteth of his Purity—he returneth sweetly to the unknown Laureat, asketh him pertinent Questions, and informeth him what a Laureat should resemble. PART II. The Poet feeleth a most uncommon Metamorphose —breaketh into out a kind of Poetical Delirium—talketh of Court-reformation, the Arts and Sciences; and seemeth to continue mad to the End of the Chapter. Who shall resume St. James's fife, And call ideal virtues into life? On tiptoe gaping, lo, I stand, To see the future laureat of the land! Dread rivals, splashing through the dirty road, With thund'ring specimens of ode, The lyric bundles on each poet's back, Intent to gain the stipend and the sack, See Mason, Hayley, to the palace scamper, Like porters sweating underneath a hamper! And see the hacks of Nichols' Magazine Rush, loyal, to berhime a king and queen; And see, full speed, to get the tuneful job, The bellman's heart, with hopes of vict'ry, throb. O thou, whate'er thy name, thy trade, thy art, Who from obscurity art doom'd to start, Call'd, by the royal mandate, to proclaim, To distant realms a monarch's feeble fame— For fame of kings, like cripples in the gout, Demands a crutch to move about— Whoe'er thou art, that winn'st the envied prize, O, if for royal smile thy bosom sighs, Of pig-economy exalt the praise;— O flatter sheep and bullocks in thy lays! To saving wisdom boldly strike the strings, And justify the grazier-trade in kings. Descant on ducks, and geese, and cocks, and hens, Hay-stacks, and dairies, cow-houses, and pens; Descant on dung-hills, ev'ry sort of kine; And in the pretty article of swine. Inform us, without loss, to twig The stomach of a feeding calf, or cow; And tell us, economic, how To steal a dinner from a fatt'ning pig; And, bard, to make us still more blest, declare How hogs and bullocks may grow fat on air. Sing how the king of Naples sells his fish, And from his stomach cribs the daintiest dish; Sing, to his subjects how he sells his game, So fierce for dying rich the monarch's flame: Sing of th' economy of German quality; Emp'rors, electors, dead to hospitality; Margraves, and miserable dukes, Who squeeze their subjects, and who starve their cooks:— Such be the burthen of thy birth-day song, And, lo, our court will listen all day long. Tom prov'd unequal to the laureat's place; He warbled with an attic grace: The language was not understood at court, Where bow and curt'sy, grin and shrug, resort; Sorrow for sickness, joy for health, so civil; And love, that wish'd each other to the devil! Tom was a scholar—luckless wight! Lodg'd with old manners in a musty college; He knew not that a palace hated knowledge, And deem'd it pedantry to spell and write. Tom heard of royal libraries, indeed, And, weakly, fancied that the books were read; He knew not that an author's sense Was, at a palace, not worth finding; That what to notice gave a book pretence, Was solely paper, print, and binding? Some folks had never known, with all their wit, Old Pindar's name, nor occupation, Had not I started forth—a lucky hit, And prov'd myself the Theban bard's relation. The names of Drummond, Boldero, and Hoare, Though strangers to Apollo's tuneful ear, Are discords that the palace-folks adore, Sweet as sincerity, as honour dear! The name of Homer, none are found to know So much the banker soars beyond the poet; For courts prefer, so classically weak, A guinea's music to the noise of Greek: Menin aeide thea, empty sounds, How mean to—‘Pay the bearer fifty pounds!’ Angels, and ministers of grace, what's here? See suppliant Sal'sb'ry to the bard appear! He sighs—upon his knuckles he is down!— His lordship begs I'll take the poet's crown. Avaunt, my lord!—Solicitation, fly! I'll not be zany to a king, not I: I'll be no monarch's humble thrush, To whistle from the laurel bush; Or, rather, a tame owl, to hoot Whene'er it shall my masters suit. I have no flatt'ries cut and dried—no varnish For royal qualities, so apt to tarnish, Expos'd a little to the biting air: I've got a soul, and so no lies to spare;— Besides, too proud to sing for hire, I scorn to touch a venal lyre. Avaunt, ye sceptred vulgar—purpled, ermin'd! The muse shall make no mummies, I'm determin'd. World, call her prostitute, bawd, dirty b?, If meanly once she deals in spice and pitch; And saves a carcase, by its lyric balm, So putrid, which the very worms must damn. PART II. Oh, were I monarch of this mighty isle! By verse unvarnish'd should my merits smile; The nobler virtues dare themselves display, And need no pedestal to show away: Each from herself her own importance draws, And scorns a chattering poet's mock applause. Oblig'd not to one poet's rhime, Important, down the stream of time, Proud let me sail, or not at all; Too proud for verse to take in tow my name, Just like the Victory Ships of the line., or Fame Ships of the line., That, by its painter, drags the gig or yawl. Prepar'd for ev'ry insult, servile train, To take a kicking, and to fawn again! Off, Pitt and Grenville!—you are not yet men— Go, children, to your leading-strings agen, Make not a hobby-horse of this fair isle:— Yet, were no danger in the childish sway, A kingdom might permit a baby's play, And at its weaknesses indulge a smile. Off, then!—once more upon your letters look— Go, find of politics the lost horn-book. Off with Excise, your imp, with lengthen'd claws, And fangs deep-rooted in his hydra-jaws; That monster, damping Freedom's sacred joys; Fed by your hands, ye pair of foolish boys! My soul, to Freedom wedded, Freedom loves; Then blast me, lightnings, when, so coldly cruel, I to pomatum sacrifice the jewel, Rouge, pigtail, and a pair of gloves. Off, J?! some dæmon did create thee: Oh, form'd to fawn, to kneel, to lie, to flatter! ‘Perdition catch my soul, but I do hate thee! And when I hate thee not,’ I war with Nature. Such reptiles dare not 'midst my radiance sport— Curs'd be such snakes that crawl about a court. Disgrace not, simp'ring sycophants, my throne!— E?, and pigmy V?t, be gone! Br?, thou stinkest!—weasel, polecat, fly! Thy manners shock, thy form offends my eye. As for thy principles—they're gone long since— Lost when a poor deserter from thy Prince. ?, avaunt!—thou'rt cowardly and mean; Thy soul is sable, and thy hands unclean.— Yet to minutiæ to descend, what need? Enough, that thou art one of Charles's breed. Out with that Sal'sbury!—Dundas, avaunt! Off, water-gruel Westmoreland, and Leeds! You, verily, are not the men I want— My bounty no such folly feeds. Off, Harcourt! who wouldst starve my kine, Or make them, poor lean devils, dine On vile horse-chesnuts—'tis a cursed meal— Instead of turnips, corn, and hay: Thou shalt not, by this avaricious way, Into my royal favour steal. Off, Uxbridge!—Leeds, too, once more get along! You shall not be lord-presidents of song; You throw poor St. Cecilia into fits: You've ears, but verily they do not hear, Just as you've tongues that cannot speak, I fear; And brains that want their complement of wits. Off, Walsingham!—thou putt'st me in a sweat: I hate a jack-in-office martinet— For ever something most important brewing, For ever busy, busy, nothing doing. Thou plague of post-office, the teaser, fretter; Informing clerks the way to seal a letter; Who, full of wisdom, hold'st thyself the broom, Instructing Susan how to sweep the room; The letter-man, to hold his bag; The mail-guard (sunk in ignorance forlorn!) To load his blunderbuss, and blow his horn; Off, off!—of consequence thou rag! Go to the fields, and gain a nation's thanks— Catch grasshoppers and butterflies for Banks. I want not fellows that can only prate; I want no whirligigs of state— No jack-a-lanterns, imitating fire, Skipping, and leading men into the mire. Thou servile copyist, West, begone! With nought worth saving of thy own; Phillis and Chloe, dancing dogs, Pinetti, and the fortune-telling hogs, Toymen and conj'rors, from my presence fly! I have no children to amuse—not I. Off, Sw?g! thou lean, old, wicked cat; Restless and spitting, biting, mewing, mean, Thou shalt not in my chimney-corner squat, Thou shalt not, haridan, be queen: Off, to thy country, by the map forgot, Where tyranny and famine curse the spot. Yet empty first thy bags of plunder'd gain, Wages of vile political pollution; Then vanish, thou old fistula! a drain Enervating our glorious constitution! Off, H?gs' wife!—thy di'monds bode no good; They shall not taint us—lo, they smell of blood! Off, off, old G?'s spawn!—now E?'s fury, In manners coarser than the dames of Drury! O form'd for ugliness itself a foil! Sprung from the church, the world might well suppose Thy blood with some few drops of meekness flows— No, vitriol!—not one particle of oil! I'll have no laureat—sacred be the ode; Unsullied let its torrent roll! Few merits mine, the muse's wing to load; Small grace of form, and no sublime of soul: And yet, whate'er the merits that are mine, By verse unvarnish'd shall they shine. The real virtues dare themselves display, And need no pedestal to show away: Each from herself her own importance draws, And scorns a chatt'ring poet's mock applause. Have niggard Nature, and my stars, unkind, Of sense and virtues stript my desert mind; My name let Silence, with her veil, invade, And cold Oblivion pour th' eternal shade. Oblig'd not to an author's rhime, Important, down the stream of time, O let me sail, or not at all; Too proud for bards to take in tow my name, Just like the Victory, or Fame, That drag along the jollyboat or yawl. Away, the little sniv'ling spirit— Away the hate of rising merit— Thy heav'n-ward wing, aspiring genius, wave; I will not, lev'ling with a jaundic'd eye, The secret blunderbuss let fly, To give thee, O thou royal bird! a grave. I'll have no poet-persecution—no! Proud of its liberty, the verse shall flow; The mouth of Pegasus shall feel no curb: If, idly wanton, poets tax me wrong, Their's is the infamy, for their's the song— Such blasts shall ne'er my soul's deep calm disturb. But should fair truth to satire lend an edge, Bid with more force descend her thund'ring sledge, My justice dares not break that poet's pipe; And, like a school-boy, to the tiger's den, Who wanton flings a cat, a cock, or hen, I will not give him to Macdonald's The Attorney-general. gripe. Wise let me hush of prejudice the storm, Disarm him for the future, and reform:— Yes; 'stead of giving him a law-jobation, Revenge the blow by reformation. To Teos, which of yore was reckon'd far, Hipparchus really sent a man of war, To bring Anacreon, honied bard, to court; So Plato says, a man of good report. How diff'rent monarchs of the present day! From modern kings each bee like minstrel sculks, Whose love would clap the bard on board the hulks, Or send him out to warble at Thieves' Bay Commonly called Botany Bay.. Come, Science, and the Arts, around me bloom— Thrice-welcome, half my empire claim— The eye of genius shall not wear a gloom, Nor Boydell dash my cheek with shame. Historians, poets, painters, ev'ry merit, Shall feel king Peter's fost'ring spirit. Yes, men of genius, be my equals, free— Imperious consequence you shall not feel; For show collected, just to bend the knee, And grace, like slaves of yore, a chariot-wheel. Avaunt, the parasitic dedication, A trap to catch my smile, deceive the nation, And make the wide-mouth'd million bless my name: Ah! let my deeds alone, instead of lies, Proclaim me open, gen'rous, good, and wise— Those manly heralds of a virtuous fame. Here, from your hovels, sons of Science, come: Oh, haste! and call King Peter's house your home: Your huts, your solitary mountains, quit, And make my court a galaxy of wit. Come, Virtue, though a dungeon hide thy face (For to thy lot too oft misfortune falls), Whose angel-form, from jails can blot disgrace, And cast a sacred splendour o'er the walls. Thus shall our moments glide on golden wings; Thus will we triumph with expanded hearts; At times be merry upon thrifty kings, And smile at majesty that starves the arts. Ambitious, if with wisdom thus we wed; A farthing shall not blush to bear our head! COMPLIMENTARY EPISTLE TO JAMES BRUCE, ESQ. The Abyssinian Traveller. ?Non fabula mendax. Wonders!—Wonders!!—Wonders!!! A COMPLIMENTARY EPISTLE. Sweet is the tale, however strange its air, That bids the public eye astonied stare! Sweet is the tale, howe'er uncouth its shape, That makes the world's wide mouth with wonder gape! Behold our infancies in tales delight, That bolt like hedgehog quills the hair upright. Of ghosts how pleas'd is ev'ry child to hear! To such is Jack the Giant-killer dear! Dread monsters, issuing from the flame or flood, Charm, though with horror cloth'd they chill the blood! What makes a tale so sleepy, languid, dull? Things as they happen'd—not of marvel full. What gives a zest, and keeps alive attention; A tale that wears the visage of invention: A tale of lions, spectres, shipwreck, thunder; A wonder, or first cousin to a wonder. Mysterious conduct! yet 'tis Nature's plan To sow with wonder's seeds the soul of man, That ev'ry where in sweet profusion rise, And sprout luxuriant through the mouth and eyes. What to the vasty deep Sir Joseph Sir Joseph Banks. gave, As of the world, the sport of wind and wave? What bade the knight, amid those scenes remote, Sleep with Queen Oborea in the boat? What, unconfounded, leap to Newton's chair? What, but to make a world with wonder stare? What bids a king on Wimbledon, Blackheath, So oft rejoice the regiments of death; While Britain's mightier bulwark slighted lies, And vainly groaning for its Cæsar sighs? What, with the vulgar pigs of Ascot taken, Devour on Ascot Heath Constantly, yea, with annual constancy, do their august majesties devour the fine fat bacon of Ascot at the time of the races, and, after deeply loading their royal stomachs with this savoury meat, in grateful return load Ascot and the bacon with royal approbation. his annual bacon? What bade that great, great, man, a goodly sight, Watch his wife's di'mond petticoat all night; And what that wife of great, great, great renown, Make her own caps, and darn a thread-bare gown? What bade the charming Lady Mary Lady Mary Duncan. fly Marchesi's squeeze, for Pacchierotti's sigh? What Master Edgecumbe deal in rhiming ware? What but to put all Cawsand A small fishing-town near Mount Edgecumb. in a stare? Sweet child of verse, who, with importance big, Pleas'd its own self, and eterniz'd a pig This pig, Cupid, who many years ago fell in love with the earl, has a monument erected to his memory, with an inscription on it by Lord Valletort, the earl's son.—It is said, that his majesty, when at Mount Edgecumbe, happening to be gravely pondering near his grave, the queen, who was at some distance, asked him, what he was looking at so seriously. His majesty, with a great deal of humour, immediately replied, ‘The family vault, Charly; family vault, family vault.’; Whilst, mad an equal weight of praise to share, Old Mount plays Punchinello to a hair. What makes a girl the shops for novels rove? The sweet impossibilities of love? Quixotic deeds to catch the flying fair; To pant at dangers, and at marvels stare. What prompteth Chloe, conscious of the charms That crowd the souls of swains with wild alarms, To give the swelling bosom's milk-white skin A veil of gauze so marvelously thin? What but a kind intention of the fair To treat the eyes of shepherds with a stare? Behold! Religion's self, celestial dame, Founds on the rock of miracle her fame: A sacred building, that defies decay, That sin's wild waves can never wash away! What made John Rolle Mr. John Rolle's dread of a failure in the etiquette of presentment to his majesty when at Exeter, prevailed on him to take a deal of trouble with gentlemen who were to be introduced at the levee: but, in spite of all his intellectual powers, which, like his corporeal, are of more than ordinary texture, much disorder happened; indeed the best of kings was three or four times nearly overturned. Many were the gentleman that Mr. Rolle was forced to place himself behind, to pull down properly on their knees; and many were the gentlemen he was obliged to run after, and make face to the right about, who uncourteously, though unwittingly, in quitting the presence, had turned their unpolished tails on majesty. (except for Exon's stare) Drill-serjeant to the aldermen and may'r? E'er from the hall he led his chosen bands, To view the king of nations, and kiss hands? How rarely man the haunts of wisdom seeks, Pleas'd with the life of cabbages and leeks! Though form'd to plough the soil, divinely strong, 'Tis famine goads him, like an ox, along: But Bruce, on curiosity's wild wings, Darts, hawk-like, where the game of marvel springs, Let envy kindle with the blush of shame, That dares to call thee, Bruce, a thief of fame. Pleas'd to thy wonder's vortex to be drawn, A thousand volumes could not make me yawn: And (O accept a salutary hint)— The world will read as fast as thou canst print. Curs'd by the goose's and the critic's quill, What tortures tear us, and what horrors thrill! Thus that small imp, a tooth a simple bone, Can make fair ladies and great heroes groan; Tear hopeless virgins from their happy dream, And bid for doctors 'stead of sweethearts scream: In tears the tender tossing infant steep, And from its eyelids brush the dews of sleep; Where with a cheek in cherub blushes drest, It seeks, with fruitless cries, its vanish'd rest. Far diff'rent, Thou, erect in conscious pride, Colossal dar'st the critic host bestride; Like yelping coward curs canst make them skip, And tremble at the thunder of thy whip. How hard that thou, a busy working bee, Shouldst range from flow'r to flow'r, from tree to tree; Fly loaded home from shrubs of richest prime, Egyptian, Nubian, Abyssinian thyme, And plund'ring Alluding to an abridgment of Mr. Bruce's Travels. drones upon thine honey thrive, Who never gave an atom to the hive! Huge whale of marvel-hunters, further say, And glad the present and the future day; Speak! did no angel, proud to intervene, Bear thee, like Habbakuk, from scene to scene? Lo! moon-ey'd Wonder opes her lap to thee: How niggardly, alas! to luckless me! Where'er through trackless woods thy luckier way, Marvels, like dew-drops, beams on every spray, Blest man! whate'er thou wishest to behold, Nature as strongly wishes to unfold; Of all her wardrobe offers every rag, Of which thy skill hath form'd a conj'ror's bag. Thy deeds are giants, covering ours with shame! Poor wasted pigmies! skeletons of fame! To thee how kindly hath thy genius giv'n The massy keys of yonder star-clad Heav'n; With leave, whene'er thou wishest to unlock it, To put a few eclipses in thy pocket! Nature where'er thou tread'st, exalts her form; The whisp'ring zephyr swells a howling storm; Where pebbles lay, and riv'lets purl'd before, Huge promontories rise, and oceans roar. Thrice envy'd man (if truth each volume sings), Thy life how happy! hand and glove with kings! A simple swain, a stranger to a throne, I ne'er sat down with kings to pick a bone! For smiles I gap'd not, crouch'd not for assistance; But paid my salutations at a distance: Yet live, O kings, to see a distant date, Because I've got a pretty good estate; A comely spot near Helicon, that thrives; A leasehold though, that hangs upon your lives; Set to George Kearsley, at a moderate rent; Enough for me, poor swain, it brings content. Where Heav'n to place a crown upon my head, So meek, so modest I should faint with dread: And like some honest bishop, with a sigh, ‘Pity my greatness, lord!’ would be my cry. Poets, like spiders, now-a-days must spin, Ev'n from themselves, the threads of life so thin. Nought pleaseth now the rulers of great nations, But books of wonders, and sweet dedications. Kings, like the mountains of the moon, indeed, Proud of their stature, lift a lofty head; Heads, like the mountains also, cold and raw, That, ice-envelop'd, seldom feel a thaw. O may the worst of ills, my soul betide, For me if ever lovesick lady died! If fatal darts from these two eyes of mine, Play'd havoc with fair ladies hearts, like thine: No, no! I ever a hard bargain drove, And purchas'd ev'ry atom of my love. O Bruce, I own, all candour, that I look With envy, downright envy, on thy book, A book like Psalmanazar's, form'd to last, That gives th' historic eye a sweet repast; A book like Mandeville's, that yields delight, And puts poor probability to flight; A book that e'en Pontopidan would own; A book most humbly offer'd to the throne; A book, how happy, which the king of isles Admires (says rumour), and receiv'd with smiles! The fool, with equal gape, astonish'd sees, Through Wonder's glasses, elephants and fleas; But thou, in Wonder's school long bred, full grown, Art pleas'd indeed with elephants alone: Hadst thou been God, an insult to thy sight, Thy majesty had scorn'd to make a mite. Know, where th' Atlantic holds th' unwieldy whale, My heart has panted at the monster's tail: Had Bruce been there, th' invincible, the brave, How had he dash'd at once beneath the wave! Bold with his dirk the mighty fish pursu'd, And stain'd whole leagues of ocean with his blood; Then rising glorious from the great attack, Grac'd with the wat'ry tyrant on his back! 'Mid those fair isles The Canaries, or the Insulæ Fortunatæ of the ancients., the happy isles of old, Plains that the ghosts of kings and chiefs patrol'd, These eyes have seen; but, let me truth confess, No royal spectre came, these eyes to bless: To no one chieftain-phantom too, I vow, With rev'rence, did I ever make my bow: Gone to make room, poor ghosts, so fate inclines, For gangs of lazy Spaniards and their vines. But had thy foot, illustrious trav'ler, trod, Like me the precincts of th' Elysian sod; Full of inquiry, easy, unconfounded, By spectres hadst thou quickly been surrounded; Then had we heard thy book of wonder boast, How Bruce the brave shook hands with ev'ry ghost! In vain did I phænomena pursue, For Wonder waits upon the chosen few. Whate'er I saw requir'd no witch's storm— Slight deeds, that Nature could with ease perform! Audacious, to purloin my flesh and fish, No golden eagles hopp'd into my fish. Nor crocodiles, by love of knowledge led, To mark my figure, left their oozy bed; Nor loaded camels, to provoke my stare, Sublimely whirl'd, like straws, amid the air; Nor, happy in a stomach form'd of steel, On roaring lions have I made a meal. Unequal mine with lions' bones to cope; Thy jaws can only on such viands ope. O hadst thou trod, like me, the happy isle, Whose mountain Teneriffe. treats all mountains with a smile: Bold hadst thou climb'd th' ascent, an easy matter, And, nobly daring, sous'd into the crater; Then out agen hadst vaulted with a hop, Quick as a sweeper from a chimney-top. O had thy curious eye beheld, like mine, The isle Madeira. which glads the heart with richest wine! Beneath its vines, with common clusters crown'd, At eve my wand'ring steps a passage found, Where rose the hut, and neither rich nor poor, The wife and husband, seated at the door, Touch'd, when the labours of the day were done, The wire of music to the setting sun; Where, blest, a tender offspring, rang'd around, Join'd their small voices to the silver sound But had thine eye this simple scene explor'd, The man at once had sprung a sceptred lord; Princes and princesses the bearns had been; The hut a palace, and the wife a queen; Their golden harps had ravish'd thy two ears, And beggar'd all the music of the spheres; So kind is nature always pleas'd to be, When visited by favourites, like thee! Strange! thou hast seen the land, that, to its shame, Ne'er heard our good ?'s virtues, nor his name! I've only seen those regions, let me say, Where his great virtues never found their way. Alas! I never met with royal scenes! No vomits gave to Abyssinian queens! Drew not from royal arms the purple tide, Nor scotch'd with fleams, a sceptred lady's hide; Nor, in anatomy so very stout, Ventur'd to turn a princess inside out; Nor blushing, stripp'd me to the very skin, To give a royal blackamoor a grin. I never saw (with ignorance I own) Mule-mounted monarchs, seek th' imperial throne; Which mule the carpet spoil'd—a dirty beast! First stal'd; then—What?—Oblivion cloud the rest. I saw no king, whose subjects form'd a riot, And, imp-like, howl'd around him for his quiet. Nor have I been where men (what loss, alas!) Kill half a cow, and turn the rest to grass. Where'er, great trav'ler, thou art pleas'd to tread, The teeming skies rain wonders on thy head: No common birth to greet thine eye appears, But sacred labours of a thousand years. Where'er the Nile shall pour the smallest sluice, The rills shall curl into the name of Bruce. And, lo! a universe his praise shall utter, Who, first of mortals, found the parent gutter; And, let me add, of gutters too the queen, Without whose womb the Nile had never been. Thus many a man, whose deeds have made a pother, Has had a scurvy father or a mother. O form'd in art and science to surpass; To whom e'en valour is an arrant ass; O Bruce, most surely travel's eldest son; Tell prithee, all that thou hast seen and done! I fear thou hidest half thy feats, unkind! A thousand wonders, ah! remain behind! Where is the chariot-wheel with Pharaoh's name, Fish'd from the old Red Sea to swell thy fame? Where the horse-shoe with Pharaoh's arms, and found Where wicked Pharaoh and his host were drown'd? Where of that stone a slice, and fresh account, Giv'n by the Lord to Moses on the Mount? And where a slice of that stone's elder brother, That, broken, forc'd th' All-Wise t'engrave another? Where of the cradle too, a sacred rush? Where a true charcoal of the burning bush? And O the jewel, curious gem, disclose, That dangled from the Queen of Sheba's nose, When, with hard questions, and two roguish eyes, She rode to puzzle Solomon the Wise? Sagacious terrier in discovery's mine, Shall Nature form no more a nose like thine? No more display'd the pearls of wonder beam, When thou, great man, art past the Stygian stream? To Afric wilt thou never, Bruce return? Howl, Britain? Europe, Abyssinia mourn! Droop shall Discovery's wing, her bosom sigh, And marvel meet no more the ravish'd eye; Nature outstep her modesty no more; Her cataracts of wonder cease to roar, Forc'd to a common channel to subside, And pour no longer an astounding tide? O bid not yet thy lucky labours cease; Still let the land of wonder feel increase: Thy loads of dung, delightful ordure, yield, And blossom with fertility the field: Gates, hedges mend, that ignorance pull'd down, And bring in triumph back each kidnapp'd town. Though envy damns thy volumes of surprise, Blest I devour them with unsated eyes! What though sour Johnson cry'd, with cynic sneer, ‘I deem'd at first, indeed, Bruce had been there: But soon the eye of keen investigation, Prov'd all the fellow's tale a fabrication:’ But who, alas! on Johnson's word relies, Who saw the too kind north with jaundic'd eyes; Who rode to Hawthornden's fair scene by night, For fear a Scottish tree might wound his sight; And, bent from decent candour to depart, Allow'd a Scotchman neither head nor heart? Grant fiction half thy volumes of surprise, High in the scale of merit shalt thou rise: Still to Fame's temple dost thou boast pretension; For thine the rara avis of invention? And, lo! amidst thy work of lab'ring years, A dignity of egotism appears; A style that classic authors should pursue; A style that peerless Katerfelto A late celebrated philosopher and conjuror. knew! Thou dear man-mountain of discovery, run; Again attempt an Abyssinian sun! Yes, go; a second journey, Bruce, pursue; More volumes of rich hist'ry bring to view. O run, ere Time the spectred tombs invade, And seize the crumbling wonders from the shade; Crowd with fair columns, struck by Time, thy page, And snatch the falling grandeur from his rage: Give that old Time a vomit too, and draw More of Egyptian marvels from his maw; Bid him disgorge (by moderns call'd a hum), Scratch'd by ten thousand trav'lers, Memnon's bum; And, what all rarities must needs surpass, The tail, the curious tail, of Balaam's ass. Say, what should stop, O Bruce, thy grand career; Or Fame the fav'rite, and no child of fear? Danger's huge form, so dread to vulgar eyes, Pants at thy presence, and a coward flies. Where other trav'lers, fraught with terror, roam, Lo! Bruce in wonder-land is quite at home; The same cool eye on Nature's forms looks down; Lions and rats, the courtier and the clown. Whate'er thine action, wonder crowds the tale; It smells of Brobdignag—it boasts a scale! Fond of the lofty, Bruce no pigmy loves— Who likes a pigmy, that a giant moves? Again—what pigmy, with a form of lath, Lost in his shadow, likes the man of Gath? The bowerly hostess, for a cart-horse fit, Scorns Daphne's reed-like shape, and calls her chit; Whilst on the rough robustious lump of nature, Contemptuous Daphne whispers, ‘What a creature!’ Pity! pursuits like thine should feel a pause, More than half-smother'd by fair Fame's applause! I see thee safe return'd from Marvel's mine, Whose gems in ev'ry rock so precious shine; Proud of the product of a world unknown, Unloading all thy treasure at the throne; While courtiers cry aloud with one accord, ‘Most marv'lous is the reign of George the Third!’ How like the butchers' boys we sometimes meet, Stuck round with bladders, in a London street: In full-blown majesty who move, and drop, The bloated burden in an oilman's shop; Whilst country bumpkins, gazing at the door, Cry they ‘ne'er zeed zo vine a zight bevore.’ I see old Nile, the king of floods, arise, Shake hands, and welcome thee with happy eyes; Otters and alligators in his train, Made by thy five immortal volumes vain; Weasels and polecats, sheregrigs, carrion-crows, Seen and smelt only by thine eyes and nose. ‘Son of the arts, and cousin of a king, Loud as a kettle drum whose actions ring,’ Exclaims the king of floods, ‘thy books I've read, ‘And for thy birth-place, envy brother Tweed.’ O Bruce, by Fame for ever to be sung; Job's war-horse fierce, thy neck with thunder hung: When envious Death shall put thee in his stable, Snipp'd life's fine thread, that should have been a cable; Lo! to thy mem'ry shall the marble swell, Mausoleum huge, and all thy actions tell! Here, in fair sculpture, the recording stones Shall give thee glorious, cracking lions' bones; There, which the squeamish souls of Britain shocks, Rich steaks devouring from the living ox: Here, staring on thee from the realm of water, Full many a virtuoso alligator; There, Bruce informing queens, in naked pride, The feel and colour of a Scotsman's hide: Here of the genealogy a tree, Branching from Solomon's wise trunk to thee; There, with a valour nought could dare withstand, Bruce fighting an hyæna hand to hand; Which dread hyæna (what a beast uncouth!) Fought with a pound of candles in his mouth: Here temples bursting glorious on the view, Which hist'ry, though a gossip, never knew; There columns starting from the earth and flood, Just like the razor-fish from sand and mud: Here a wise monarch, with voracious looks, Receiving all thy drawings and thy books; Whilst Fame behind him all so solemn sings The lib'ral spirit of the best of kings. Mau says, O Bruce, that thou wert hardly us'd; That our great king at first thy book refus'd; Indeed look'd grimly 'midst his courtier crew, Who, gentle courtiers! all look'd grimly too! Thus when in black the lofty sky looks down, The sympathizing sea reflects a frown; Vale, cattle, reptile, insect, man and maid, All mope, and seem to sorrow in the shade. Steep is th' ascent, and narrow is the road, Ah me! that leads to Fame's divine abode: Yet thick (through lanes, like pilgrimaging rats, Unaw'd by mortals, and unscar'd by cats) What crawling hosts attempt her sacred fane, And dizzy, drunk-like, tumble back again; Fast as the swains, whose arms the damsels fill, Embrace of elegance down Greenwich hill; Whilst thou, Briareus like, with dauntless air, Resolv'd to ravish Fame, immortal fair, Just like our London bullies with the w? Hast scal'd the cloud-capt height, and forc'd her doors! O form'd the trav'lers of the east to scare, Although thy pow'rs are mighty, learn to spare: Dog should not prey on dog, the proverb says: Allow then brother-trav'lers crumbs of praise; Like thee, let others reap applause, and rise By daring visits to Egyptian skies: But calmly, lo! thou canst not see them pass; ‘This is a rogue or fool, and that's an ass.’ Thus on a tree, whene'er the weather's fine, Jack Ketch, the spider, weaves the fatal line; Beneath a leaf he hides with watchful eye, Now darts, and roping hangs the trav'ling fly. Again, most tiresome, let me say, Go, go, Proceed, and all about it let us know: Led safely by thine enterprising star, Hyænas shall not with thy journey war: Uneat by tigers, dare the forest's gloom, To bid the barren field of knowledge bloom: Wave o'er new pyramids thine eagle wings; And, hound-like, scent fresh tombs of ancient kings, Which time had buried with the mighty dead, And cold oblivion swallow'd in her shade; And mind ('tis History's province to surprise) That tales are sweetest, that sound most like lies. ODE TO JAMES BRUCE, ESQ.As the confessed Superiority of Mr. Bruce to Mr. Boswell entitles him to a more eminent Mark of Distinction, I have added an Ode, in my best Manner, to this Complimentary Epistle, which the Congratulatory Epistle to Mr. Boswell cannot boast. O Bruce, for this his short and sweet epistle, Thou biddest p'rhaps the gentle bard ‘go whistle;’ Or somewhat worse, perchaunce, that rhimes to knight; That is to say, knights of the blade, One time so busy in the dubbing trade, That, like to silver, it was shoulder'd bright. Pity by hungry critics thou shouldst fall, So clever, and so form'd to please us all! Again!—by royal favour all-surrounded, A balm so rich, like cloves and nutmegs pounded! Thus the bag fox, (how cruelly, alack!) Turn'd out with turpentine upon his back, Amidst the war of hounds and hunters flies; Shows sport; but, luckless, by his fragrance dies! Safe from the fury of the critic hounds, O Bruce, thou treadest Abyssinian grounds; Nor can our British noses hunt thy foil: Indeed, thou need'st not dread th' event; Surrounding clouds destroy the scent, And mock their most sagacious toil: Yes, in thy darkness thou shalt leave the dogs; For hares, the hunters say, run best in fogs. Of thee and me, two great physicians, How diff'rent are the dispositions! Thy soul delights in wonder, pomp, and bustle; Mine in th' unmarvellous and placid scene, Plain as the hut A house close by the glorious Castle of Windsor. of our good king and queen;— I imitate the stationary muscle. Yet, boldly thou, O Bruce, again proceed; Of wonder ope the fountain head; Deluge the land with Abyssinian ware; Whilst I, a simple son of peace, The world of bagatelle increase, By love-sick sonnets to the fair. Now to Sir Joseph, now a duke, now wren, Now robin red-breast, dedicate the pen; Now glow-worm, child of shade and light, not flame; To whom, of wicked wits the tuneful art, So very apt, indeed, from truth to start, Compares the nightly street-meand'ring dame. Mild insect, harmless as myself, I ween: Thou little planet of the rural scene, When summer warms the valleys with her rays, Accept a trifling sonnet to thy praise. ODE TO THE GLOW-WORM. Bright stranger, welcome to my field, Here feed in safety, here thy radiance yield; To me, O nightly be thy splendor giv'n; Oh, could a wish of mine the skies command, How would I gem thy leaf with lib'ral hand, With ev'ry sweetest dew of Heav'n! Say, dost shou kindly light the fairy train, Amidst their gambols on the stilly plain, Hanging thy lamp upon the moisten'd blade? What lamp so fit, so pure as thine, Amidst the gentle elfin band to shine, And chase the horrors of the midnight shade. Oh! may no feather'd foe disturb thy bow'r, And with barbarian beak thy life devour: Oh! may no ruthless torrent of the sky, O'erwhelming, force thee from thy dewy seat; Nor tempests tear thee from thy green retreat, And bid thee 'midst the humming myriads die! Queen of the insect world, what leaves delight? Of such these willing hands a bow'r shall form, To guard thee from the rushing rains of night, And hide thee from the wild wing of the storm. Sweet child of stillness, 'midst the awful calm Of pausing Nature thou art pleas'd to dwell; In happy silence to enjoy thy balm, And shed through life a lustre round thy cell. How diff'rent man, the imp of noise and strife, Who courts the storm that tears and darkens life! Blest when the passions wild the soul invade! How nobler far to bid those whirlwinds cease; To taste, like thee, the luxury of peace, And shine in solitude and shade! THE RIGHTS OF KINGS, OR LOYAL ODES TO DISLOYAL ACADEMICIANS. ??? ????? ????? ??????. ANACREON. Thus for a mighty monarch to be levell'd! Pray were you drunk, or mad, sirs, or be-devill'd? PROËMIUM.TO THE READER. GENTLE READER, The foundation of the following Odes is simply this—The President of the Royal Academy, happy to be able to gratify our amiable monarch in the minutest of his predilections, reported lately to the academicians his majesty's desire, that a Mr. Laurence might be added to the list of R. A.'s, his majesty, from his superior knowledge in painting, being perfectly convinced of this young artist's uncommon abilities, and consequently fair pretensions to the honour. Notwithstanding the royal wish, and the wish of the President, and (under the rose!!!) the wish of Mr. Benjamin West, the Windsor oracle of paint, and painter of history, the R. A.'s received the annunciation of his majesty's wish, Sir Joshua's wish, Mr. West's wish, with the most ineffable sang froid, not to call it by the harder name, disgust. The annunciation happening on the night of an election of Associates, at which Mr. Laurence ought to have been elected an Associate (a step necessary to the more exalted one of R. A.)—behold the obstinacy of these royal mules!—the number of votes in favour of Mr. Laurence amounted to just three, and that of his opponent, Mr. Wheatley, to sixteen!!! —Indignant and loyal reader! the lyric Muse, who has uniformly attacked meanness, folly, impudence, avarice, and ignorance, from her cradle, caught fire at the above important event, and most loyally poured forth the following Odes, replete with their usual sublimities. TO THE PUBLIC. Gentles! behold a poor plain-spoken man! Modest as Addington our Speaker, Amidst Saint Stephen's patriotic clan, Where Innocence so meek did ne'er look meeker; When with much palpitation, and much dread, He turn'd about his pretty Speaker's head, One leg just rais'd to hop into the chair; Just like a cat in rain amid the street, That fears to wet her white and velvet feet, Which for a handsome gutter-leap prepare! ‘I fear I am a most unworthy choice,’ Said Mister Speaker, with a lamb-like voice! ‘I have but one step more,’ he cried, Keeping his head coquettishly aside. How much like Christie, with his hammer rais'd (Christie, a public speaker too, so prais'd), Looking around him, simpering, smiling, bowing, Then crying—‘Gemmen, going, going, going!’ Yes, gentles all, a modest bard, and shy, With dove-like mien, and ground-exploring eye; Modest as Mister Speaker at the Lords, When lowly he did majesty beseech T' allow his humble Commons use of words; That is to say, a liberty of speech: Also to have at times a tête-à-tête, Because a confab royal is a treat; Indeed for subjects much too rich, As wise King James asserted of the itch: Likewise to have the privilege of tick, Because a bailiff is a meddling rogue, Who, with a hand of iron, or a stick, Stoppeth the travels of our men of vogue! Barbarian act, that men of worship frets! Who think of loftier things than idle debts; Deep pond'ring ever on the nation's good, Not on great greasy butchers, tailor knaves, Mercers and clammy grocers—compter slaves, Who, by their stinking sweat, procure their food. Tradesmen! a set of vulgar swine; Crutches for Fortune in a deep decline: Lo what a tradesman's good for, and lo all— A wooden buttress for a tott'ring wall! With tears have I beheld full many a 'squire Most brutally by bailiffs dragg'd along; For turnpike, furniture, or house's hire, Horse, wages, coach, or some such idle song! Now 'squire's a title of much reputation— Belongs to people of no—occupation; Who cannot (in their looks we read it) Get, for a mutton-chop, a little credit! Poor gentlemen! how hard, alas! their fate, To knuckle to such nuisances of state! Gentles, to you, well pleas'd, I turn again, Quitting my fav'rite rambling strain; Leaving belov'd, admir'd, ador'd digression, So practis'd by us men of ode-profession, When we have scarcely aught to sing or say, And sneaking fancy quits the lyric lay. I do remember!—What?—That thus my pen Licentious, slander'd crown-and-sceptre men! ‘Readers, one moment look me in the face; A poet not quite destitute of grace; And answer one not bred in Flatt'ry's schools— Are you, or are you not, a set of fools! Pinning your faith on Grandeur's sleeve— Say, do you, in your consciences, believe That m?s never can be weak nor mean; And that a m?'s wife, yclept a ?, May not (and why not?) be a downright slop, Form'd of the coarsest rags of Nature's shop? I read the answer in each visage’—‘No.’ ‘O Jesu! can it be? and is it so? Put down my book— Give it not one contaminating look: I stare on you with pity—nay, with pain— Kearsley shall toss your money back again: Get your crowns shav'd, poor souls—I wish you well— And hear me—Bedlam has a vacant cell.’ Such were the stanzas that I wrote of yore, When tainted by a king-deriding clan; But now I curse those tenets o'er and o'er— A convert quite—a sweet and alter'd man: The sacred force of sov'reignty I feel— To royalty's stern port I learn to kneel— For royalties are deem'd most sacred things; So sacred by the courtiers, that the Bible May be inform'd against, and prov'd a libel, For saying—‘Put no confidence in kings!’ Though this indeed may be interpolation, As much was coin'd by Popish priests and friars; For ah! how hard 'tis for imagination To fancy monarchs hypocrites and liars! ODE TO THE ACADEMICIANS. Am I awake, or dreaming, O ye gods? Alas! in waking's favour lie the odds! The dev'l it is! ah me! 'tis really so! How, sirs! on majesty's proud corns to tread! Messieurs Academicians, when you're dead, Where can your impudencies hope to go? Refuse a monarch's mighty orders!— It smells of treason—on rebellion borders! 'Sdeath, sirs! it was the queen's fond wish as well, That Master Laurence A young portrait-painter of some merit. should come in! Against a queen so gentle to rebel! This is another crying sin! What!—not oblige, in such a trifling thing, So sweet a queen, and such a goodly king! A queen unus'd to opposition-weather— At disappointment so unus'd to start— So full of dove-like gentleness her heart, As if the dove had lent its softest feather, That heart of gentleness to form, Unus'd (as I have said) to opposition-storm! O let me just inform you, one and all, That kings and potentates, both great and small, Born to be humour'd, for obedience battle: Most instantaneous too must be compliance; Refusal is most damnable defiance; They struggle for't, like children for the rattle. But in our simile some diff'rence lies— We whip a bantling when it kicks and cries, Fully determin'd not to please it; But lo! the children that possess a crown (Young Herculeses) knock us down, And, angry for the bauble, seize it. Each of you, sirs, has kept a cur, perchaunce: Poor wretch, how oft his eyes with lightnings dance; How he looks up to master for a smile! Shakes his imploring head with wriggling tail, Now whining yelps, now pawing to prevail, Eager with such anxiety the while; And if a pat should bless the whining scraper, Lord, how the animal begins to caper! Thus should it be with subjects and great kings— But you are strangers to these humble things. For shame! upon the courtier's creed go look— And take a leaf from humble Hawksb'ry's book; Or sweet neck-bending water-gruel Leeds, Who majesty with pap of flatt'ry feeds; Which pap, if highly relish'd, will of course, Rewarded, make him Master of the Horse. Where was Prerogative?—asleep? A blockhead, not a better watch to keep In this most solemn, most important hour! Why heard we not the thunder of his voice; Saw down your gullets cramm'd the royal choice, So easy to the iron arm of power? Why slept his sledge, the guardian of a crown, So form'd to knock unruly rascals down? Ah me! Prerogative seems nearly dead! Behold his tott'ring limbs and palsied head; Sunk in their orbits his dim eyes; His teeth dropp'd out; and hark! his voice so weak; A mouse behind the wainscot—eunuch squeak! ‘Ah! non sum qualis eram,’ now he sighs. To ev'ry body's call, ah! now so pliant! Sad skeleton of once a sturdy giant! Poor bending shrivell'd form, but just alive, Art thou that bully once—Prerogative? Where is the mien of Mars, the eye's wild stare, A meteor darting horror with its glare? How like a brandy-drinker, who on flame Feeds with a rosy beacon-face at first; But, by his enemy Intemp'rance curst, Yields to that victor of mankind with shame; Pale, hobbling, voiceless, crawling to decay, Just like a passing shadow, sinks away! Bed-chamber lords are all in ire— The maids of honour all on fire; Nay, though despotically shav'd, the cooks, Bluff on th' occasion, put on bull's-beef looks: And really this is very grand behaving, So nobly to forgive the famous shaving! See Madam Schwellenberg most cat-like stare; And though no fav'rite of the king, She cries, ‘By Got, it shock and make my hair Upright—it is so dam dam saucy ting.’ Stanhope, perchance, will clasp you in his arms; And Price's ghost, with eloquence's charms, Will, from his tomb upspringing, sound applause: But know, I deem not so of Edmund Burke: He nobly styles the deed, ‘a d?mn'd day's work;’ Superior he to cutting royal claws. Mun very justly thinks the human back Should be to kings a sort of humble hack; That ev'ry subject ought to wear a saddle, O'er which those great rough-riders, kings, may straddle. ODE II. The fam'd Assembly of the French will smile, At this disgrace of our fair isle: Messieurs Fayette the Great and Co. With tears of joy will overflow, And order the assembly of the nation To send you sweet congratulation. What has thou to complain of each, thou imp? Compar'd to kings, a grampus and a shrimp! Lo! when from Windsor mighty kings arrive, Like London mack'rel, all alive! Tureens of flatt'ry are prepar'd so hot By courtiers—a delicious pepper-pot; Which, to be sure, the royal maw devours, Kings boasting very strong digestive pow'rs. A pointer thus, lock'd up a week, Half starv'd, and longing for a steak; Behold him now turn'd loose so wild to eat— Gods! how he gobbles down the broth and meat! Yes, flatt'ry-soups are all prepar'd so hot, As I have hinted, a fine pepper-pot: Side-dishes too of curtsies, bows, and scrapes, With stare and wonder in all sorts of shapes; Attentions darting from the full-stretch'd eye, That not a royal glance may pass unheeded by: Attentions sharp as those of Lumpy, Small, At cricket skill'd to catch the flying ball; Whilst you survey (abominable thing!) With cold contempt the character of king! Think by what royal bounty you are blest! Think of the patronage to painters all! Not a poor shallow rill confin'd to West, But torrents that like Niagara fall. Yes, George is gen'rous—watches all your wants— And pours his fost'ring rains upon his plants. Then, meeting such a friend, you ought to cry ‘Glory be to George on high!’ Thus, when two clouds approach, a wand'ring pair, As oft it happens, 'mid their walks in air; Though one be rich, the other poor In rare electric matter, how they greet! With what delight they seem to meet; And, pleas'd, with all the fire of friendship roar. George, O ye raggamuffins, loves you dearly; Sends you rare pictures for improvement yearly; Buys up your works, and much commission gives To hist'ry, portrait, landscape men— Careful as of her chicken a good hen: Thus like an alderman each limner lives, Yes; a good hen—I see her wing display'd, To warm, protect you with parental shade: But you, a flock of vile rebellious chicken, Are all for mounting on your mother's back, With threat'ning beak and noisy saucy clack, Her eyes out, trying to be picking; Against her blasphemously swearing: This is undutiful beyond all bearing. Where'er the plaintive cry of want appears, Cock'd, like a greyhound's, are the king's two ears: Ready for such poor wights to bake and brew! A circumstance believ'd by very few! Thus, to philosophy's surprise, A pin can lead the lightning of the skies! ODE III. Behold, his majesty is in a passion! Tremble, ye rogues, and tremble all the nation! Suppose he takes it in his royal head To strike your academic idol dead; Knock down your house, dissolve you in his ire, And strip you of your boasted title—'squire! To bend a piece of iron to your will, You always make that iron hot; For then it asks but little force and skill— Its sturdiness is quite forgot: But lo! it is quite otherwise with man! Make him red-hot, and bend him as you can: So widely diff'rent are the metals, Composing man, or kings indeed, and kettles! Oft has he left his queen and Windsor tow'rs, Oft from the fascinating dairy flown, To raise the arts with all his mighty pow'rs, And hold high converse with the folks of town: From lofty Carthage thus, by Jove's decree, On nobler works than those of love, intent, Æneas from the widow Dido went, And full of piety, put off to sea! Vain of you academic honours, vain, I say agen, Idly you deem'd yourselves the first of men; And then You spurn'd the hand which rais'd you into notice— By all the gods, unfortunately, so 'tis! Full oft, by Fortune, man is play'd a trick; Too often ruin'd by her glitt'ring toys, Just like the candle's luckless wick Surrounded by the lustre that destroys. ODE IV. Resistance turns me, like a napkin, pale; Rebellion chills me into stone; ‘Tell not in Gath the tale, Nor publish in the streets of Ascalon.’ Copy the manners of a court: There (thanks to education for't) Submission cow'ring creeps, with fearful eye, Unceasing bends the willowy neck to ground, In rev'rence, abject and profound, Too humbly modest to behold the sky: There, all alive too, Hawk Attention sits, To study royal Humour's various fits; With wings expanded, ready to fly post, To east, to west, to north, or south, To cater for a monarch's mighty mouth, To get him bak'd, or grill'd, or broil'd, or roast: Now scampers to pick up each bit of news, Which full-fed London ev'ry moment sp?s: Then to the palace the rich treasure bears, And pours the whole into the royal ears. There Adulation, with her silver tongue, Sweeter than Philomela's sweetest song, Says unto majesty such things! Tells him that Cœsar won not half his fame; That Alexander was a childish name Compar'd to his—the King of Kings! Now smiling, staring huge surprise, With such a brace of wonder-looking eyes, On all the words from majesty that dart; As if bright gems, as large as eggs of pullet, Flow'd from the king's Golconda gullet, Enough, indeed, to load a cart: Her mouth so pleas'd the treasures to devour! Wide as the port-hole of a seventy-four! Such is the picture of a palace scene, Drawn by an amateur I ween: The outline chaste, and easy flowing; The colouring not a whit too glowing. Such, such is Adulation, charming maid! Whose conduct you won't copy, I'm afraid. ODE V. At opposition, lo! the soul demurs At such the royal mind revolts; Hates it as much as sticks the cats and curs, Or curbs, and whips, and spurs, high-mettled colts. Too well I know that you the great despise; Molehills, instead of mountains, in your eyes: 'Tis wrong! I often rev'rence Grandeur in my song. Go, sirs, to court upon a gala day: Soon as the soldiers cry aloud, ‘Make way!’ How gloriously the courtiers strut it by, In gorgeous clothes of silk and gold, With such an elevated front, and bold, With such state-consequence in either eye; So much above the ground on which they strut, So stiff, so stake-like, all the pompous pack, As though Dame Nature had forgot to put The joints of manners to the neck and back. O glorious sight! this no one dares deny: And lo! I'd lay considerable odds, That man who ne'er divinities did spy, Would really take them for a pack of gods! Grant that the great are ignorant—what then! Still they are folks of worship—still great men; Though flogg'd through schools, and banish'd from a college, Although not one inch broad their minds, I ween: The utmost boundary of all their knowledge, The Game-act and John Nichol's Magazine. Still men of worship, must they all appear Beings we little people should revere! 'Tis nat'ral to revere the folk on high; To rev'rence, lo! our infancies are led! Well do I recollect how oft my eye Ador'd the kings and queens of gingerbread: King David, Solomon, and that brave queen Her majesty of Sheba. Who rode so far to see, and to be seen: Though hungry as a hound, with pence in store, When in their glory on the stalls I met 'em; Though longing to devour them o'er and o'er, I deem'd it sacrilege to eat 'em! ODE VI. The light of Reason is a little ray, But still it shows us the right way: Indeed, the gentlewoman makes, no blaze, No bonfire tempting a fool's eyes to gaze— A modest dame, remote, and calm, and coy, And never playeth gambols to destroy. But Error, what a meretricious jade, Amidst her trackless wilds immers'd in shade, To tempt the silly and unwary! Her meteor, lo! she lights!—here, there, Up, down, she dances it—now far, now near, In mad and riotous vagary. On the fools wander, in pursuit so stout, And love of this same garish light; All on a sudden goes this meteor out; And caught, like badgers, in the sack of night, Blund'ring and trying to get back agen, They roll about in vain, poor men. Thus you Academicians all proceed! You are those badgers, gentlemen, indeed! There seems an ardent spirit, to my mind, A revolution spirit, 'mongst mankind: A spark will now set kingdoms in a blaze, That would not fire a barn in former days; So lately turn'd to touchwood is each state— So whimsical, indeed, the ways of Fate! Pray, sirs, both old and young, ye bright and muddy, Did ever you make cuckoldom your study? P'rhaps not, if rightly I divine— But, gentlemen, I've made it mine. This state of man, and let me add obscenity, Is not a situation of betweenity, As some word-coiners are dispos'd to call't— Meaning a mawkish, as-it-were-ish state, Containing neither love nor hate— A sort of water-gruel without salt. Know then, that Cuckoldom's all eye, all ear, All smell, all taste, and, faith! all feeling— His senses sharp as those of cats appear, To right, to left—as quick as soldiers wheeling, To catch a wife's bad fame, alas! not praise; Thus setting traps to squeeze his future days; Watering with one eternal tear the eye, And making lovely Life one lengthen'd sigh: A pair of antlers his—he sits on thorns— He nothing sees but horns, horns, horns! Nay, to the cuckold in idea, lo, On either side his head a horn appears Tremendous! but which all his neighbours know Are only one huge pair of ass's ears. Then pray dismiss your jealousies and frights; Our m?????h means not to invade your rights: It never, never was a royal plan— ‘For Brutus is an honourable man!’ Greater from Chambers should be all your fears, Whose house is tumbling fast about your ears. ODE VII. The king (God grace him) wishes you to shine: He rais'd the building with your cash and mine: But what is wealth? what thousands? trifling things! To swell the mighty volume of its fame, He call'd it royal—thus he gave the name; Which proveth the munificence of kings— Heav'ns, what a present! ah, well worth possessing! Lo! on a level with a bishop's blessing! Domitian (so says Hist'ry, with a sigh) Would quit affairs of state, to hunt a fly: But we have no such trifle-hunting kings— Europe knows no such miserable things! Her princes gallop on a larger scale; No flippant minnow, but the flound'ring whale! George wishes not to give the dome a grave; Not to destroy he cometh—but to save: Not like Dame Nature, who composes forms The fairest for the fascinated eye; Then sends her lightnings, floods, and storms, To bid the beauteous flowrets die! When once a woman's handsome, smart, and clever, In God's name let her bloom for ever! Ah! could I snatch Time's ploughshare from his hand, Who, with that ease a farmer skirts his land, Furrows so cruelly o'er the fairest face! Relentless as a Mohawk, on he goes, Cuts up the lily and the rose, Roots up each wavy curl, and bends the neck of grace— Ah! could I simply do but this, The sweetest lips would give me many a kiss. By raising, then destroying like a Turk, It seems as though Time did not like his work; As though he wanted something better still, Than e'er was manufactur'd at his mill. And yet how exquisite, of charms the crop In Mesdames Johnson's The priestesses of the Cyprian goddess., Kelly's The priestesses of the Cyprian goddess., Windsor's The priestesses of the Cyprian goddess. shop, Or rather hot-house!—Lord, if fond of billing, What grace, for guineas, we may find! Nay, in the streets, if cheapness suits our mind, We purchase Cleopatras for a shilling! O Beauty, how thou stealest me away! Born, thou sweet witch, thy poet to beguile! Thy fool, idolator, by night, by day, He feels a chain in ev'ry smile. Thou tyrant of my heart, let go my pen I must, will speak to academic men. Sirs! should the royal eagle, from his height, Dart on your puny forms, his eye of flame, And wanton, just to exercise his might (Deeming you no ignoble game), Should pounce on your owl-backs, so stout, How would a cloud of feathers fly about! The thunder of his beak, for falling, ripe— What figures you would cut within his gripe! This can the king of isles perform—I know it— Yet, though of pow'r so full, he will not show it. Too soon your band its weakness would deplore! A crab in a cow's mouth—no more! Say, don't you tremble at th' affronted name? Where lurks the burning blush of shame? Alas! that symptom of remaining grace Knows not to tinge an academic face! Sons of the dev'l like you, rebellious, hear— It is for kings to burden—us to bear. I own I've said (and glory in th' advice), ‘Be not, O king, as usual, over-nice: Dread sire, (to take a phrase from Caliban) “Bite 'em”— To pour a heavier vengeance on the clan, Knight 'em.’ ODE VIII. The modern French deem monarchs much like fire, Which a good looking-after doth require— Too much inclin'd to prove an evil; A fire that needeth to be well secur'd, Well iron'd, pinion'd, and immur'd, Which otherwise would play the devil: Yet if on politics a bard may prate, I deem their monarch's jacket rather strait. Mesdames Poissardes, 'twas shockingly ill bred, To fling your flounders at your monarch's head. Though, Venus-like, descended from the flood, 'Twas base, ye sweet divinities of mud. To this great truth, a universe agrees, ‘He who lies down with dogs, will rise with fleas.’ How applicable! lo, you took advice, I'm sure, from that arch-devil, Doctor Price, And Stanhope—who so praise the French and clap, For catching kings, like polecats, in a trap. O may I never be—but were I king, Like ropes should I consider laws; Preventing, when I wish'd it, a good spring— Hand-cuffs to bind my lion claws. A set of articles implies mistrust— How can the Lord's anointed be unjust! We never should believe such things As doubt the wisdom of the King of kings: What the Lord chooses must be good, Although he sent us but a piece of wood. Ev'n Chesterfield ‘I confess I have some regard for King Log.’ Vide his Letters., that atheistic dog, Declares he has a rev'rence for King Log. ‘When will that lucky day be born, that brings A bridle for the arrogance of kings? Too slowly moves, alas! the loit'ring hour. When will those tyrants cease to fancy man A dog in Providence's lev'ling plan, To crouch and lick the blood-stain'd rods of pow'r?’ Such is your most unkingly cry— And lo, I tell it with a sigh! Rank is in man the itch of opposition, Which wanteth a good whip for a physician. You keep bad company that turns your head— So hungrily you ev'ry thing devour, That tends to clip the wings of royal pow'r, Which like the eagle's pinion ought to spread; So greedily suck in Rebellion's breath, That wafts the seeds of impudence and death. Thus, hound-like, at a lord-mayor's feast, A common-councilman, a beast, On ev'ry season'd dish so hungry stuffs— Unbuttons, wipes the sweat away, and puffs. Poor fool! he swallows rheumatism and gout, Asthma and apoplexy—and more ills Than doctors, with their knowledges so stout, Can vanquish with their bolusses and pills! But, sirs, you must be cautious how you act; Attorney-general is no reasoning thing! 'Tis an indubitable fact, This fellow is the creature of a king; His eagle—thunder-bearer—loud his cry— And ‘Instant vengeance’ is his sole reply. 'Tis dangerous to shake hands with such hard claws, His gripe enough to make the bravest pause! Then be not at your midnight orgies seen, Buzzing opinions upon king and queen. Ah! should he sally forth so strong, Amidst your wantonness of speech and song; Unlin'd by mercy, you will feel his gripe, Stopping the melody of many a pipe. Thus at the solemn, still, and sunless hour, When to their sports the insect nations pour: In airy tumult blest, the light-wing'd throng, Thoughtless of enemies in ambuscade, Hums to night's list'ning ear the choral song, And wantons through the boundless field of shade; When, lo! the mouse-fac'd demon of the gloom, Espying, hungry meditates their doom! Bounce, from his hole so secret bursts the bat, To honour, mercy, moderation, lost! Behold him sally on the humming host, And murd'rous overturn the tribes of gnat; Nimbly from right to left, like Tippoo, wheel, And snap ten thousand pris'ners at a meal! ODE IX. How pleasant 'tis the courtier clan to see! So prompt to drop to majesty the knee; To start, to run, to leap, to fly; And gambol in the royal eye! And, if expectant of some high employ, How kicks the heart against the ribs, for joy! How rich the incense to the royal nose! How liquidly the oil of flatt'ry flows! But should the monarch turn from sweet to sour, Which cometh oft to pass in half an hour, How alter'd instantly the courtier clan! How faint, how pale, how woe-begone, and wan! Thus Corydon, betroth'd to Delia's charms, In fancy holds her ever in his arms: In madd'ning fancy, cheeks, eyes, lips devours; Plays with the ringlets that all flaxen flow In rich luxuriance o'er a breast of snow, And on that breast the soul of rapture pours. Night too entrances—Slumber brings the dream— Gives to his lips his idol's sweetest kiss; Bids the wild heart, high panting, swell its stream, And deluge every nerve with bliss: But if his nymph unfortunately frowns, Sad, chapfall'n, lo, he hangs himself, or drowns. Oh, try with bliss his moments to beguile: Strive not to make your sov'reign frown—but smile: Sublime are royal nods—most precious things— Then, to be whistled to by kings! To have him lean familiar on one's shoulder, Becoming thus the royal arm-upholder, A heart of very stone must glad! Oh, would some king so far himself demean, As on my shoulder but for once to lean, Th' excess of joy would nearly make me mad: How on the honour'd garment I should doat— And think a glory blaz'd around the coat! Blest, I should make this coat my coat of arms, In fancy glitt'ring with a thousand charms; And show my children's children o'er and o'er: ‘Here, babies,’ I should say, ‘with awe behold This coat worth fifty times its weight in gold: This very, very coat, your grandsire wore! ‘Here,’—pointing to the shoulder—I should say, ‘Here majesty's own hand so sacred lay’— Then p'rhaps repeat some speech the king might utter; As—‘Peter, how go sheep a score? what? what? What's cheapest meat to make a bullock fat? Hæ hæ? what, what's the price of country butter?’ Then should I, strutting, give myself an air, And deem my house adorn'd with immortality: Thus should I make the children, calf-like, stare, And fancy grandfather a man of quality: And yet, not stopping here, with cheerful note, The muse would sing an ode upon the coat. Poor lost America, high honours missing, Knows nought of smile and nod, and sweet hand-kissing; Knows nought of golden promises of kings; Knows nought of coronets, and stars, and strings: In solitude the lovely rebel sighs; But vainly drops the penitential tear— Deaf as the adder to the woman's cries, We suffer not her wail to wound our ear: For food we bid her hopeless children prowl, And with the savage of the desert howl. ODE X. ‘Man may be happy, if he will:’ I've said it often, and I think so still: Doctrine to make the million stare! Know then, each mortal is an actual Jove; Can brew what weather he shall most approve, Or wind, or calm, or foul, or fair. But here's the mischief—man's an ass, I say; Too fond of thunder, lightning, storm, and rain; He hides the charming, cheerful ray That spreads a smile o'er hill and plain: Dark, he must court the scull, and spade, and shroud— The mistress of his soul must be a cloud! Who told him that he must be curs'd on earth?— The God of Nature?—No such thing: Heav'n whisper'd him, the moment of his birth, ‘Don't cry, my lad, but dance and sing; Don't be too wise, and be an ape:— In colours let thy soul be dress'd, not crape. ‘Roses shall smooth life's journey, and adorn; Yet, mind me—if, through want of grace, Thou mean'st to fling the blessing in my face, Thou hast full leave to tread upon a thorn.’ Yet some there are, of men I think the worst, Poor imps, unhappy if they can't be curs'd— For ever brooding over Mis'ry's eggs, As though life's pleasure were a deadly sin; Mousing for ever for a gin To catch their happinesses by the legs. Ev'n at a dinner, some will be unbless'd, However good the viands, and well dress'd: They always come to table with a scowl, Squint with a face of verjuice o'er each dish, Fault the poor flesh, and quarrel with the fish, Curse cook and wife, and, loathing, eat and growl. A cart-load, lo, their stomachs steal, Yet swear they cannot make a meal. I like not the blue-devil hunting crew, I hate to drop the discontented jaw, O let me Nature's simple smile pursue, And pick ev'n pleasure from a straw! ODE XI. Treat sov'reigns, sirs, with more respect, I beg, To thrones, with due decorum make a leg; Ev'n those are sacred, though but empty chairs: There lurks in thrones a something, tho' but wood, That thrills with awe the vulgar mass of blood, And fills the mouth and eye with gapes and stares: Wishing by no means to affront, I wonder what's the meaning on't. Louis Quatorze was quite the Frenchman's god; Who made all nations tremble at his nod; Married Scarron's old widow, dry and frowsy; Got deep in debt, the constable outran; And, to complete the farce, this god-like man Died—lousy He actually had the morbus pediculosus.! The crown, so powerful, made him every thing, There's somewhat marv'lous in it, I must own— Lo, folly is not folly on a throne, For whiting's eyes are di'monds in a king! I dare not say that no exception springs Against this mighty magic pow'r of kings: Not all a monarch's smiles, and pow'rs of place, Can wipe vulgarity from Brudenell's face; Nor, though a whole eternity they try, Blot art, infernal art, from H?ksb?y's eye; Blot beast from S?lisb?y, who no legend needs, Pertness from D?k, and vacancy from L?ds. ODE XII. Lo! majesty admireth yon fair Dome The Royal Academy.; And deemeth that he is admired again! The king is wedded to it—'tis his home— He watches it—and loves it, ev'n to pain: And yet this lofty dome is heard to say, ‘Poh! poh! p?x take your love—away! away!’ To this, with energy I answer—‘Shame!’ Such bad behaviour puts me in a flame: This is unseemly, nay, ungrateful carriage, And brings to mind a little Ode to Marriage. ODE TO HYMEN; OR, THE HECTIC. GOD of ten million charming things, Of whom our Milton so divinely sings, Once dove-tail'd to a devil of a wife— Hymen, how comes it that I am so slighted? Why with thy myst'ries am I not delighted, Which I have tried to peep on half my life? God of the down-clad chains, dispel the mist— O put me speedily upon thy list! A civil list, like that of kings, I'm told, Bringing in swelling bags of glorious gold! What have I done to lose thy good opinion? Against thee was I ever known to rail; And say (abusing thus thy sweet dominion), ‘Curse me! if this boy's trap shall catch my tail?’ No! no!—I praise thy knot with bellowing breath, Which, like Jack Ketch's, seldom slips till death. Lo! 'midst the hollow-sounding vault of night, Deep coughing by the taper's lonely light, The hopeless Hectic rolls his eye-balls, sighing; ‘Sleep on,’ he cries, and drops the tend'rest tear; Then kisses his wife's cherub cheek so dear: ‘Blest be thy slumbers, love! though I am dying: Ah! whilst thou sleepest with the sweetest breath, I pump for life, the putrid well of death! I feel of Fate's hard hand th' oppressive pow'r; I count the iron tongue of ev'ry hour, That seems in Fancy's startled ear to say— Soon must thou wander from thy wife away.’ ‘Dread sound! too solemn for the soul to bear, Murm'ring deep melancholy on my ear: And sullen—ling'ring, as if loth to part, And ease the terrors of my fainting heart. Yet, though I pant for life, sleep thou, my dove, For well thy constancy deserves my love.’ And, lo! all young and beauteous, by his side, His soft, fresh-blooming, incense-breathing bride, Whose cheek the dream of rapt'rous kisses warms, Anticipates her spouse's wish so good; Feels love's wild ardours tingling through her blood, And pants amidst a second husband's arms; Now opes her eyes, and turning round her head, ‘Wonders the filthy fellow is not dead!’ ODE XIII. You quarrell'd with Sir Joshua some time since; Of painters, easily allow'd the prince— The emp'ror, let me say, without a flattery: Yet wantonly against this emp'ror, lo! An overflowing tub of bile to show, You foolish planted an infernal battery. The mind of man is vastly like a hive; His thoughts so busy ever—all alive! But here the simile will go no further; For bees are making honey one and all; Man's thoughts are busy in producing gall, Committing, as it were, self-murther. But let the spirit that surrounds my fram Sit easy on it, just like an old shoe— When Disappointment sets my house in flame, Let Reason all she can to quench it do: Reason has engines plentiful and stout, With water at command to put it out. I hate to hear men quarrelling through life, Themselves the fabricators of the strife; For ever hunting, with a hound-like nose, That hornet's nest, the tribe of woes: And when the woes invited greet 'em, They wonder how the dev'l they meet 'em. ODE XIV. Ah! could you wish your president The author has some reason to imagine that a part of the academic rebellion was meant to attack the president; the disappearance of whose works, in the present exhibition, has been fatal.—One picture from Sir Joshua's hand would have atoned for a host of daubs. to change? Ah! could you, Pagans, after false Gods range? Swop solid Reynolds for that shadow West? In love-affairs variety's no sin— Trav'lers may change at any time their inn— Here 'tis paint-blasphemy, I do protest. In love's warm regions I should like, I own, 'Midst diff'rent climes to fix my throne: David's physicians order'd change of dame Abishag, the fair Shunamite.— And, lo! t'improve our cows, we bid 'em pass Into variety of grass— With bulls, I guess, th' advantage is the same. And as I Monsieur Cupidon employ, To manufacture pieces of my joy, I would not mad run counter to the fashion: A little Sylvia, with the sweetest smile, Possesses power some moments to beguile, And in Elysium lap the prettiest passion. But not toujours perdrix—the vulgar thing! Then pleasure soon would spread her wanton wing: No! no! variety the game must start— Come oft, and make her curt'sy to my heart; And, like the orange girls, my taste to suit, Cry, ‘Choice of fruit—fine fruit, sir—choice of fruit.’ Dull Constancy is quite a quaker's hat, So formal! changeless in its great broad brim: Variety's a fine young playful cat— A hopeful imp of spirit, sport, and whim; Who, when all other objects fail, Runs after its own tail. ODE XV. Dead is idolatry, and faint the praise That sceptred people meet with now-a-days! All unmolested, lo! the virtues sleep! Their roof with fair applause but rarely rings— Sweet Panegyric moves with snail-like creep, And Defamation on the lightning's wings! Too pleas'd to pluck the soaring plume of pow'r, You bless an opposition hour; Too fond, alas! of roasting harmless kings; Too well I know what freedoms you would take— Beat the dear creatures just like bears at stake; Just like a poor tame gull's, would clip his wings! Poor bird! whom fate oft cruelly assails; Forc'd from his bold aërial height, Sweeping the sun amidst his flight, To hop a garden, and hunt snails! Such is the fate of Louis Seize, Whom Pity, with a sigh, surveys; Whom Frenchmen daringly have laid a curb on; Who now no more full royally indites, No more ‘Sic volo’ to his kingdom writes, But, ‘I'm your humble servant, Louis Bourbon.’ Lettres-de-cachet, now no longer known, Shall lull no more an empire's idle groan: Bastilles, those schools of peace and sweet morality, Instruct no more the mob, and men of quality. Bastilles, the haunt of philosophic gloom, Surround the imps of liberty no more: In dust each iron and colossal door, Which clos'd in thunder on a rebel's room; That pealing, with reverberated sound, Rung through the caverns of the dread profound; Where Meditation ponder'd, pensive maid! And Horror, death-like, paus'd upon the shade. Oh, let us cherish, then, the royal race, The fount of honour, freedom, pension, place! On me would kings their treasure fling away, Most humbly grateful would I say, ‘Thus Lybia's forests a kind shade supply, And for the meanest savage form a den; And thus the mountains that invade the sky, Kind, in their shaggy bosoms warm the wren.’ ODE XVI. Amid the deep'ning gloom of time Your puny names shall scarce appear; While those of kings, in characters sublime, Shall, blazing, bid a world revere: Their peerless acts, with ev'ry virtuous quality, Shall grace the pyramid of Immortality. There shall their glorious names be seen so bright, As on a birth or coronation night, Amidst the evening's honour'd shade, Fast by the grocer's, or the chandler's shop, Or lace, or pinman, or the man of mop, By loyal thumb-bottles display'd! That, burning with a rival glow, Beam on the gaping multitude below. Know, when we slumber, not so sleeps the king— He watches!—yes, he ponders through the night! To buried Genius lends a fancied wing, And lifts him from his darkness into light: Thus, nightly on the Mevagizzy A fishing-town in Cornwall. shore, When Horror breathes upon the heaving deep, Amid the wild and solemn roar; These eyes have seen the crafty heron creep; Now dart his beak so sharp for fish's blood, And snatch a wriggling conger from the flood! Here differeth this comparison of ours— The king preserveth—but the fowl devours. ODE XVII. Go, sirs, with halters round your wretched necks, Which some contrition for your crime bespeaks, And much-offended majesty implore: Say, piteous, kneeling in the royal view— ‘Have pity on a sad abandon'd crew, And we, great king, will sin no more: Forgive, dread sir, the crying sin, And Mister Laurence shall come in.’ Your hemp cravats, your pray'r, your Tyburn mien, May pardon gain from our good king and queen, For they are not inexorable people; Although you thus have run their patience hard; And though you are, to such great folk compar'd, Candle-extinguishers to some high steeple. For kings (I speak it to their vast applause) Can pardon, if you let them gain their cause; So gracious, they will give you such kind looks, As fell upon the shav'd and humble cooks; Kind as a gard'ner's charitable eye On some crush'd snail, or bird-lim'd fly; Kind as the epicure's, who fond of mites, Mingleth compassion with his bites. How vile to make the front of monarch's low'r! I see him, all like vinegar so sour, Look black!—but, still good-humour's in his soul, And now I mark it, stealing forth so sweet— Stream of forgiveness, what a treat!— I see his eye, with love re-kindling, roll. Thus, when the demon of the storm has driv'n The sun, that youth of splendor, from his heav'n, Drown'd ev'ry vale, and blasted ev'ry bloom; Cast o'er poor Nature's smile a sable shroud, Each beauty blotted with his inkiest cloud, And giv'n a cheerful world to gloom: Lo! through the giant shade, a lonely ray, Peeps from the op'ning west with timid air, (Till forc'd by shouldering clouds away), Informing man, ‘To-morrow will be fair.’ Oh, had you rev'renc'd a great k?g's commands, What trouble he had taken off your hands! For art you had not rang'd the realm around! His keener eye the precious gem had found! Then, what an honour to have seen appointed, Your very nightman, by the Lord's anointed! ODE XVIII. A little more, and I have done— The muse's tittle-tattle must go on.— The world is very fond of calling ‘Fool:’ It looks with rapture on a simple head, Of puerilities the rich hot-bed, So pleasing to the taste of Ridicule. Rare crops! that, thick'ning into life, Start, like asparagus, to tempt the knife. And should the head belong to some great duke, Hawk-satire eyes it with the keenest look: Still, should the owner hap to be a king, Sharp for her quarry, how she prunes her wing! Such is the proneness to assail great folk, And make high birth and state a standing joke. Oh, for an ointment to destroy the scab Call'd Envy, which alas! too many know! The heart should be a medlar, not a crab; Milk, and not verjuice, from its fount should flow: But Greatness, sun-like, from the muddy stream, Draws the foul vapour that obscures its beam! Indeed, the people are a lawless crew— Why strive I then, Quixotic to reform? As soon a feather may the waves subdue, And spiders bind the pinions of the storm. Yet, 'tis not strange, that kings should lose repute Consid'ring man's so great a brute.— Ev'n saints themselves have lost their reputation: Rome formerly had thirty thousand gods; And now, I warrant ye, 'tis odds, They own scarce one through all the Romish nation. Alas! who now believes in sticks and stones, Old rags, and hair, and marrow-bones? Saint Agnes, that sweet lady, void of sin, Was stripp'd, poor gentlewoman, to her skin; And, for religion, carried to the stews; When, as the lady was so bare, God gave her such a quantity of hair, As reach'd unto her very shoes. When to the bawdy-house arrived the dame, An angel from above commission'd came, And spread around her such a heavenly light, As dazzled every body's sight. However, a young officer The son of a præfect., a buck, Wishing prodigiously to have a look, Dash'd forth, to pierce the middle of the light, Meaning to violate the dame so good; Which meaning, when the Devil understood, He choak'd the wanton rogue out-right. Such is the tale! true ev'ry crumb; Now, no more heeded than Tom Thumb. TO MR. PITT. DEAR as a di'mond to the best of queens, Dear as to cormorants, of fish a shoal; Dear to a German hog, as beds of beans; Dear as a sixpence sav'd, to Mis'ry's soul: Dear as the doctor's bill to this good nation, Which Parliament, with tears of joy, survey'd; Which brought about a much-desir'd salvation, For which the doctors have been poorly paid: Dear as the royal message What a niggardly set of representatives we send to parliament! To suffer his majesty so frequently to be begging for a little money, is shameful in the exreme.—In God's name, let him have the Treasury at once. Had he been worth ten or eleven millions, an œconomy would have been pardonable. to the nation, By which more money humbly is implor'd— ‘More money for the children's education— Hard times! more money for the children's board:’ Dear as to valiant Glo'ster sword and gun; Dear as a dock-leaf to a hungry ass; Dear to the fam'd George Selwyn, as a pun; Dear as to legs of mutton, caper sauce; Dear as the voice of flatt'ry to the proud; Dear as to hackney-coachmen signs of rain, Who count their shillings in a coming cloud, And, pious, pray for Noah's flood again; So dear to monarchs is that idol pow'r! So dear is prompt obedience to a king! Far, of resistance be the trying hour! God bless us! what a melancholy thing! Yet opposition-fraught to royal wishes, Quite counter to a gracious king's commands, Behold! th' academicians, those strange fishes, For Wheatley The rival candidate of Mr. Laurence. lifted their unhallow'd hands. So then, those fellows have not learnt to crawl, To play the spaniel, lick the foot, and fawn— Oh, be their bones by tigers broken all! Pleas'd, by wild horses could I see them drawn.— O Pitt! with thee I'm sorry, very sorry! Not make a poor associate!—such a thing! Who try'd to tarnish thus the royal glory? What rebel balloted against his king! Then, sir, he is so bountiful a man! A cataract of charity, I'll say— Inform me any body, if you can, Unmark'd by liberality a day! Where'er he walks, where'er his wild career, Through Chelt'nam, Weymouth, Exon, Plymouth, lo, With joy his staring subjects all, so dear, See from each step a stream of glory flow. Thus, when that pretty animal an ?, At night, on pavement gallops like the wind; Fire kindling at his heels, behold him pass! How bright the sparkles that hop out behind! Nurs'd on the dunghill of the smiles of kings, What mushrooms daily, to surprise us, start! So nimbly the fair vegetable springs! Such warmth prolific, can a smile impart! Such is of royalty the envied pow'r! Then perish ev'ry academic plant! Oh, may they feel nor sun, nor fost'ring show'r! Blow round them, O ye cold, cold winds of want! What nabob structures rise, with wings outspread, Whose owners' necks will merit to be lopp'd! With what sublimity they lift the head, By Death and Ruin's Atlas-shoulders propp'd! But such thy master's purity of soul, His eyes upon the sword of justice feast: ‘Curse on the pearl (he cries) by rapine stole; Curse on the di'monds of the bleeding east! ‘Curse on the villains that whole realms despoil! Curse on the cruel hand (we hear him cry) That steals the fruit of labour's honest toil, And draws the tear of blood from Pity's eye!’ O Pitt! what punishment shall we contrive, To suit this saucy, self-important crew? How shall we smoke this academic hive, That stinging makes us look so very blue? Oh, bid our monarch draw his purse-strings tight; Contract his open heart, of giant stature; Use ev'ry species of little spite, And violate for once his noble nature. Oh, bid our sov'reign take it not to heart; For downright brutes are Britons, nine in ten: At curbs and whips behold us asses start, And insolently claim the rights of men! And yet, I moderation wish to kings! Yes, yes, they should be merciful, though strong. As sceptres have been found in France with wings, One would not lose an empire for a song. ODES TO MR. PAINE, AUTHOR OF ‘RIGHTS OF MAN;’ On the intended Celebration of the Downfall of the French Empire, BY A SET OF BRITISH DEMOCRATS, On the 14th of July. Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris, vel carcere dignum, Si vis esse aliquis. ? JUVENAL ODE TO MR. PAINE. O paine! thy vast endeavour I admire! How brave the hope to set a realm on fire! Ambition smiling prais'd thy giant wish: Compar'd to thee, the man to gain a name, Who to Diana's temple put the flame, A simple minnow to the prince of fish. Say, didst thou fear that Britain was too blest, Of peace thou most delicious pest? How shameful that this pin's head of an isle, Whilst half the globe in grief, should wear a smile! How dares the wren amidst his hedges sing, Whilst eagles droop the beak, and flag the wing? O must the scythe of Desolation sleep, So keen for carnage, stay its mighty sweep, And Havock on his hunter drop his lash; Spurr'd, arm'd, and ripe to storm with groans the sky, To chase an empire, and enjoy the cry, The cry of millions—what a glorious crash! What pity thy combustibles were bad! How Death had grinn'd delight, and Hell been glad, To see our liberties o'erturning; And War, whose expectation tiptoe stood, Ready for hills of slain, and seas of blood, Who drops his death's head flag, and puts on mourning! Why, cur-like, didst thou sneak away, nay fly? Dread'st thou of anger'd Justice the sharp eye? Return, and bring Mesdames Poissardes along: And lo, with Friendship's squeeze and fire to meet 'em, And oaths of ev'ry hue to greet 'em, The sisterhood of Billingsgate shall throng. The jails may open all their dreary cells, Where horror brooding on damnation dwells, And vomit forth their grisly bands; Surrounded by this squalid host, Paine shall their leader be, and boast; Paine, Gordon, and Rebellion, shall shake hands. Importance, in a nut-shell hide thy head! I deem'd myself a dare-devil in rhime, To whisper to a king of modern time, And try to strike a royal foible dead; Whilst dauntless thou, of treason mak'st no bones, But strik'st at kings themselves upon their thrones! ODE II. Hell hears our pray'r!—all is not lost— Behold a chosen few, a host, Stand forth the champions of the glorious cause! The jails are opening!—hark! the iron doors! Chains clank!—the brazen throat of Tumult roars; And lo, the destin'd victims of the laws! Disgorg'd, they pour in dark'ning tribes along, And mingle with our democratic throng! Bedlam unlocks her melancholy cells! Forth rush the maniacs grim, with joyful yells; They tear their blankets, clap their phrensy'd hands; They grind their teeth, they dance, they foam, they stare; They rend with bursts of laughter wild the air; And join, they know not why, our thick'ning bands. Thou sun, withdraw thy hated day; To Æthiop darkness yield thy reign; And hide in clouds, O moon, thy ray, Nor peep upon our spectre scene!— Though faint thy solitary light, We feel thy feeble beam too bright. Ah! Peace, thy triumph now is o'er! Thy cheek so cheerful smiles no more; Thine eye with disappointment glooms! Our music shall be Nature's cry; Our ears shall feast on Pity's sigh— Lo, haggard Death prepares his tombs!— Hot with the fascinating grape, we reel; The full proud spirit of rebellion feel!— Son of Sedition, daring Paine, Whilst speech endues thy treason tongue Bid the roof ring with damned song, And Erebus shall echo back the strain. SONG BY MR. PAINE. Come, good fellows all—Confusion's the toast, And success to our excellent cause— As we've nothing to lose, lo, nought can be lost; So, perdition to monarchs and laws! France shows us the way—an example how great! Then, like France, let us stir up a riot; May our names be preserv'd by some damnable feat, For what but a wretch would lie quiet? As we all are poor rogues, 'tis most certainly right, At the doors of the rich ones to thunder; Like the thieves who set fire to a dwelling by night And come in for a share of the plunder. Whoever for mischief invents the best plan, Best murders, sets fire, and knocks down, The thanks of our club shall be giv'n to that man, And hemlock shall form him a crown. Our empire has tower'd with a lustre too long; Then blot out this wonderful sun; Let us arm then at once, and in confidence strong Complete what dark Gordon begun. But grant a defeat—we are hang'd, and that's all; A punishment light as a feather;— Yet we triumph in death, as we Catalines fall, And go to the Devil together. THE REMONSTRANCE; TO WHICH IS ADDED AN ODE TO MY ASS ALSO THE MAGPIE AND ROBIN, A TALE; AN APOLOGY FOR KINGS; AND AN ADDRESS TO MY PAMPHLET. Integer vitæ scelerisque purus, &amp;c. &amp;c. HOR. The man of dove-like innocence a sample, So sweet! so mild! myself now, for example, Disdains of Gossip Fame the tittle tattle! He begs no news-paper to fight his battle— Unmov'd, with equal eye on all he looks; The Lord's anointed, and his lousy cooks. I deem'd rude Clamour, in my days of youth, The solemn voice of all-commanding Truth; But now, no more creating awe and wonder: Old empty hogsheads, rumbling in a cart, That make some people gape, and stare, and start, As well may tell me, ‘We're the noble thunder.’ P. PINDAR. ODE. Wide gapes the thoughtless mouth of moon-ey'd wonder, Whilst ‘gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuss, and thunder,’ With Calumny's dark hounds the bard pursue: ‘Bring on his marrow-bones th' apostate down, The turncoat is a flatt'rer of the crown; Burn all his verses, burn the author too:’ Such is the sound of millions! such the roar Of billows booming on the rocky shore! ‘How chang'd his note! (they cry) now spinning rhimes, In compliment to monarchs of the times, Who lately felt no mercy from his rancour; The star-bedizen'd sycophants of state, Blue-ribbon'd knaves have brib'd his pliant hate; Behold him at St. James's snug at anchor.’ Thus on my ears, so patient let me say, They pour their rough, rude peals of groundless clamour; Battering, pell mell, upon my head away, Just like on anvils the smith's sledge and hammer! Howe'er the world in scorn may shake its head, Nor knave nor fool through me shall current pass; Too honest yet, I thank my stars, to spread The muse's silver o'er a lump of brass. I own the voice of Censure very proper; Greatly resembling a tobacco-stopper; Confining all the seeds of fire so stout, And quick in growth, when left to run about: But possibly I'm harden'd—yes, I fear Her frequent strokes have form'd a callous ear. There was a time when Peter ghost-like star'd When Censure thunder'd!—star'd with awe profound; With sighs to deprecate her wrath, prepar'd; So chill'd with horror at the solemn sound! But harden'd, soon he gave his ague o'er; Look'd up, and smil'd, and thought of her no more. Thus when an earthquake bids Jamaica tremble; On Sunday all the folks to church assemble, To sooth Jehovah, so devoutly studying— Prostrate they vow to keep his holy laws: Returning home, they smite their hungry craws, And scarce indulge them with a slice of pudding— Deeming, in earth-quake time, a dainty board, A sad abomination to the Lord! Ere Sunday comes again, their hearts recover; The tempest of their fears blown over, Fled ev'ry terror of the burning lake, They think they have no business now with church; So, calmly leave th' Almighty in the lurch, And sin it—till he gives a second shake. The ladies too have join'd the gen'ral cry! What! those divinities in Peter's eye! Angels in petticoats!—it ill behoves 'em: What! bite the constant Stentor of their praise, Who robb'd the muses of their sweetest lays, To tell the world how much he loves 'em! The bard, who vouches for their harmless souls, And like another Cicero persuades, The phrensy'd eye of admiration rolls— Ready to kneel and worship 'em—Oh jades! Ladies and gentlemen, Know, that I scorn a prostituted pen: No royal rotten wood, my verse veneers— O yield me, for a moment yield your ears. Stubborn, and mean, and weak, nay fools indeed, Though kings may be, we must support the breed. Yet join I issue with you—yes, 'tis granted, That through the world such royal folly rules, As bids us think thrones advertise for fools; Yet is a king a utensil much wanted— A screw, a nail, a bolt, to keep together The ship's old leaky sides in stormy weather; Which screw, or nail, or bolt, its work performs, Though downright ignorant of ships and storms. I knuckle not—I owe not to the great A thimble-full of obligation; Nor luscious wife have I, their lips to treat, To lift me to Preferment's sunny station; Like many a gentleman whom love promotes, Whose lofty front the ray of gold adorns; Resembling certain most ingenious goats, That climb up precipices by their horns. I'm not oblig'd (believe my honest word) To kiss—what shall I call 't?—of any lord: Not pepper-corn acknowledgement I owe 'em; Nay, like the God of truth, I scarcely know 'em. By me unprais'd are dukes and earls: At such most commonly my satire snarls— My pride like theirs the high-nos'd elves, Who love what's equal only to themselves. As for court virtues, wheresoe'er they lie, I leave them all to Mister Laureat Pye, The fashionable bard, whom courts revere; Who trotteth, with a grave and goodly pace, Deep laden with his sov'reign, twice a year, Around Parnassus's old famous base: Not only proving his great king alive, But that, like docks, the royal virtues thrive. But I'm not qualified to be a hack; Too proud to carry lumber on my back:— Too dainty is my lady muse, I hope, Into a coalshed to convert her shop: Her shop indeed—a very handsome room, Fill'd with rich spices and Parnassian bloom. Court poets must create—on trifles rant— Make something out of nothing—Lord, I can't! Bards must bid virtues crowd on kings in swarms, However from such company remote;— Just as good-natur'd heralds make up arms For nabob-robbers born without a coat. I'm a poor botching tailor for a court, Low bred on liver, and what clowns call mugget Part of the entrails of certain cattle.: Besides, what greatly too my gains would hurt, I cannot sew gold lace upon a drugget. Say not I'm turn'd towards the scepter'd great: Talk not of kings—I deem one half a cheat: Felt is their weakness—husks, mere husks of men! Yes, they create nobility—I know it; The veriest idiot of them all can do it, And on the falcon's perch can place the wren. But can a king command th' ethereal flame That clothes with immortality a name? Oh, could the race that fire ethereal catch! But no such privilege to kings is giv'n: So very low their int'rest lies in heav'n, They can't command enough to light a match. No, sirs, and therefore pray be civil; I've not yet bargain'd with the devil. Yet grant me sold—I've precedents a store; Besides, we poets are confounded poor; And, ah! how hard to starve, to please Morality! For Hunger, though a fav'rite of old saints, Whose pinching virtue pious hist'ry paints, Is reckon'd now a fellow of bad quality: Not deem'd a gentleman—can't show his face, Ev'n where Saint Peter's children Archbishops, bishops, &amp;c. give the grace! A rosy sinner, Luxury yclept, Long in his place hath eat, and drunk, and slept. Yes, (as I've said) we bards are mostly poor, Can scarcely drive gaunt Famine from the door! That Helicon's a hellish stream, God knows! Ah me! most rarely it Pactolian flows: Though sharp as hawks, and hungry too, and thick, Few are the golden grains that poets pick; And yet each new advent'rer of the Nine, Deems all Parnassus one mere golden mine. All this by way of wild digression— And now for my political confession. Again, ye Crown-and-Anchor sinners, I reprobate your revolution dinners. Nature at times makes wretched wares; (Amongst the smiling corn like cares) Men with such miserable souls! Nought pleases, from the moment of their birth; With horror for a while they blot the earth, Then crab-like, crawl into their burying-holes. How like a dreary dull December day, That shows his muddy discontented head, Low'rs on the world awhile, then moves away In gloom and sullenness to bed! Have not our revolution host a few Of souls of this same Æthiop hue? Permit me, sirs, to tell you, ye are mad; Your case, although not mortal, yet quite bad: An ugly inflammation of the brain. Although a dull physician, I could find Something to calm the hurry of the mind, And bring you back to common sense again— The stocks would do it, gentlemen, or jails: A heavy nostrum—yet it rarely fails. Lo, Drunkenness, a blust'ring, bullying blade, The cock'd hat covering half one eye so brave, As though dread valour were his meat, his trade, Nature a driv'ler, and the world his slave: He rants, roars, prays, howls, swears, on boldly goes, To seize sun, moon, and planets, by the nose; When lo, Night's long-staff'd guardian to him steals, Squints with one eye on him, and then the other; To pillow well his head, trips up his heels, And lays him on old earth, our common mother— Thence at the round-house, in about an hour, Renews his poor debilitated pow'r Of comprehending, feeling, hearing, seeing— Yet is this watchman too a heavy being. Keel up lies France!—long may she keep that posture! Her knav'ry, folly, on the rocks have toss'd her; Behold the thousands that surround the wreck! Her cables parted, rudder gone, Split all her sails, her main-mast down, Choak'd all her pumps, broke in her deck; Sport for the winds, the billows o'er her roll! Now am I glad of it with all my soul. France lifts the busy sword of blood no more; Lost to its giant grasp the wither'd hand: O say, what kingdom can her fate deplore, The dark disturber of each happy land? To Britain an insidious damn'd Iägo— Remember, Englishmen, old Cato's cry, And keep that patriot model in your eye— His constant cry, ‘Delenda est Carthago.’ France is our Carthage, that sworn foe to truth, Whose perfidy deserves th' eternal chain! And now she's down, our British bucks forsooth Would lift the stabbing strumpet up again. Love I the French?—By heav'ns 'tis no such matter! Who loves a Frenchman, wars with simple nature. What Frenchman loves a Briton?—None: Yet by the hand this enemy we take; Yes, blund'ring Britons bosom up the snake, And feel themselves, too late indeed, undone. The converse chaste of day, and eke of night, The kiss-clad moments of supreme delight, To Love's pure passion only due; The seraph smile that soft-ey'd Friendship wears, And Sorrow's balm of sympathizing tears, Those iron fellows never knew. For this I hate them.—Art, all vanish'd art! This doth experience ev'ry moment prove: And hollow must to all things be the heart, That foe to beauty, which deceives in love. Hear me, Dame Nature, on those men of cork— Blush at a Frenchman's heart, thy handy work; A dunghill that luxuriant feeds The gaudy and the rankest weeds! Deception, grub-like, taints its very core, Like flies in carrion—pr'ythee, make no more. Not but a neighb'ring nation to the French Have morals that emit a stronger stench, That Christian noses scarcely can withstand: The heart a dungeon, hollow, dark, and foul, The dwelling of the toad, snake, bat, and owl, Demons, and all the grimly spectre band. Mad fools!—And can we deem the French profound, And, pleas'd, their infant politics embrace, Who drag a noble pyramid to ground, Without one pebble to supply its place? Yet are they follow'd, prais'd, admir'd, ador'd. Be with such praise, these ears no longer bor'd! This moment could I prove it to the nation all, That verily a Frenchman is not rational. Yes, Frenchmen, this is my unvarying creed, ‘You are not rational indeed; So low have fond conceit and folly sunk ye: Only a larger kind of monkey!’ ‘What art thou writing now?’ the world exclaims, ‘Thou man of brass!’ Good world, no names, no names—I beg, no names— Writing?—an Ode to my old fav'rite Ass. Not making royal varnish—no! My ass's virtues bid my numbers flow: Peter his name, my namesake, a good beast; A servant to my family some years.— To me is gratitude a turtle feast; It is a virtue that my soul reveres; And therefore I've been fabricating metre All in the praise of honest Peter. ODE TO MY ASS, PETER. O thou, my solemn friend, of man despis'd, But not by me despis'd—respected long! To prove how much thy qualities are priz'd, Accept, old fellow-traveller, a song. My great great ancestor, of lyric fame, Immortal! threw a glory round the horse; Then, as I lit my candle at his flame, That candle shall illumine thee of course. For why not thou, in works and virtues rich, In Fame's fair temple also boast a niche? How many a genius, 'midst a vulgar pack, Oblivion stuffs into her sooty sack, Calmly as Jew old-clothes men, in their bags, Mix some great man's lac'd coat with dirty rags; Or satin petticoat of some sweet maid, That o'er her beauties cast an envious shade! And what's the reason?—Reason too apparent! Ah! ‘quia vate sacro carent,’ As Horace says, that bard divine, Whose wits so fortunately jump with mine. Ah, Peter, I remember, oft, when tir'd And most unpleasantly at times bemir'd, Bold hast thou said, ‘I'll budge not one inch further; ‘And now, young master, you may kick or murther.’ Then have I cudgell'd thee—a fruitless matter! For 'twas in vain to kick, or flog, or chatter. Though, Balaam-like, I curs'd thee with a smack; Sturdy thou dropp'dst thine ears upon thy back, And trotting retrograde, with wriggling tail, In vain did I thy running rump assail: For lo, between thy legs thou putt'dst thine head, And gavest me a puddle for a bed. Now this was fair—the action bore no guile: Thou duck'dst me not, like Judas, with a smile. O were the manners of some monarchs such, Who smile ev'n in the close insidious hour That kicks th' unguarded minion from his pow'r! But this is asking p'rhaps of kings too much. O Peter, little didst thou think, I ween, When I a school-boy on thy back was seen, Riding thee oft, in attitude uncouth; For bridle, an old garter in thy mouth; Jogging and whistling wild o'er hill and dale, On sloes, or nuts, or strawb'ries to regale— I say, O Peter, little didst thou think, That I, thy namesake, in immortal ink Should dip my pen, and rise a wondrous bard, And gain such praise, sublimity's reward; But not the laurel—honour much too high; Giv'n by the king of isles to Mister Pye, Who sings his sov'reign's virtues twice a year, And therefore cannot chronicle small beer. Yet simple as Montaigne, I'll tell thee true; There are, who on my verses look askew, And call my lyric lucubrations stuff: But I'm a modest, not unconnyinge elf, Or I could say such things about myself— But God forbid that I should puff! Yet natural are selfish predilections! Like snakes they writhe about the heart's affections, And sometimes too infuse a poisonous spirit; Producing, as by nat'ralists I'm told, Torpid insensibility, so cold To ev'ry brother's rising merit. Wits to each other just like loadstones act, That do not always like firm friends attract; Though of the same rare nature, (strange to tell!) The little harden'd rogues as oft repel. But lo, of thee I'll speak, my long-ear'd friend! Great were the wonders of thy heels of yore; Victorious, for lac'd hats didst thou contend; And ribbons grac'd thy ears—a gaudy store. Buff breeches too have crown'd a proud proud day, Not thou, but which thy rider wore away; Triumphant strutting through the world he strode, Great soul! deserving an Olympic ode. Thy bravery often did I much approve; Rais'd by that queen of passions, Love. Whene'er in Love's delicious phrensy crost By long-ear'd brothers, lo wert thou a host! Love did thy lion-heart with courage steel! Quicker than that of Vestris mov'd thy heel: Here, there, up, down, in, out, how thou didst smite! And then no alderman could match thy bite! And is thy race no more rever'd? Indeed 'tis greatly to be fear'd! Yet shalt thou flourish in immortal song, To me if immortality belong; For stranger things than this have come to pass— Posterity thine hist'ry shall devour, And read with pleasure how, when vernal show'r In gay profusion rais'd the dewy grass, I led thee forth, thine appetite to please, And mid the verdure saw thee up to knees! How, oft I pluck'd the tender blade! And, happy, how thou cam'st at my command, And wantoning around, as though afraid, With poking neck didst pull it from my hand, Then scamper, kicking, frolicksome, away, With such a fascinating bray! Where oft I paid thee visits, and where thou Didst cock with happiness thy kingly ears, And grin so 'witchingly, I can't tell how, And dart at me such friendly leers; With such a smiling head, and laughing tail: And when I mov'd, how griev'd, thou seem'dst to say, Dear master, let your humble ass prevail; ‘Pray, master do not go away’— And how (for what than friendship can be sweeter?) I gave thee grass again, O pleasant Peter. And how, when winter bade the herbage die, And Nature mourn'd beneath the stormy sky; When waving trees, surcharg'd with chilling rain, Dropp'd seeming tears upon the harass'd plain, I gave thee a good stable, warm as wool, With oats to grind, and hay to pull: Thus, whilst abroad December rul'd the day, How plenty show'd within, the blooming May! And lo, to future times it shall be known, How, twice a day, to comb and rub thee down, And be thy bed-maker at night, Thy groom attended, both with hay and oat, By which thy back could boast a handsome coat, And laugh at many a fine court lord and knight, Whose strutting coats belong p'rhaps to the tailor, And probably their bodies to the jailor! What though no dimples thou hast got; Black sparkling eyes (the fashion) are thy lot, And oft a witching smile and cheerful laugh; And then thy cleanliness!—'tis strange to utter! Like sin, thy heels avoid a pool, or gutter; And then the stream so daintily dost quaff! Unlike a country alderman, who blows, And in the mug baptizeth mouth and nose! What though I've heard some voices sweeter; Yet exquisite thy hearing, gentle Peter! Whether a judge of music, I don't know— If so, Thou hast th' advantage got of many a score That enter at the opera door. Some people think thy tones are rather coarse; Ev'n love-sick tones, address'd to lady asses— Octaves indeed of wondrous force; And yet thy voice full many a voice surpasses. Lord Cardigan, if rightly I divine, Would very gladly give his voice for thine: And Lady Mount Her m?y is always happy to have Lady Mount E? by her side, as being one of the ugliest women in England—in short, his lordship in petticoats., her majesty's fine foil, For whom perfumers, barbers, vainly toil, Poor lady! who has quarrell'd with the graces, Would very willingly change faces. How honour'd once wert thou! but ah, no more! Thus too despis'd the bards—esteem'd of yore! How rated once, the tuneful tribes of Greece! Deem'd much like di'monds—thousands worth a piece! How great was Pindar's glory!—On a day, Entering Apollo's church, to pray, The lady of the sacred fane, or mistress, Or, in more classic term, the priestess, Address'd him with ineffable delight— ‘Great sir, (quoth she) in pigs, and sheep, and calves, Master insists upon't that you go halves: To beef his godship also gives you right.’ Thus did the twain most hearty dinners make; Pindar and Phœbus eating steak and steak: When too (Pausanius says), to please the god— Between each mouthful, Pindar sung an ode! Thus half a deity was this great poet! Now this was grand in Phœbus—vastly civil— How chang'd are things! the present moments show it; For bard is now synonymous with Devil! Just to three hundred years ago, I speak— How simple scholarship was wont to rule! A man like Doctor Parr, that mouth'd but Greek, Was almost worshipp'd by the sage and fool; Deem'd by the world indeed a first-rate star. How diff'rent now the fate of Doctor Parr! Unknown he walks!—his name no infants lisp— Not only reckon'd not a first-rate star Is this our Greek man, Doctor Parr, But, Gods! not equal to a Will-o'-wisp! Plague on't! how niggardly the trump of Fame, That wakes not Bellendenus The preface to Bellendenus was a coup d'essai of the doctor's for a bishopric—it was the child of his dotage. The pap of party supported it some little time; when, after several struggles to remain amongst us, it paid the last debt of nature. on the shelf! The world so still, too, on the doctor's name, The man is really forc'd to praise himself! ‘Archbishops, bishops,’ (so says Doctor Parr) ‘By alpha, beta, merely, have been made; Why from the mitre then am I so far; So long a dray-horse in this thundering trade’ O Pitt, shame on thee!—art thou still to seek The soul of wisdom in the sound of Greek?’ Peter, suppose we make a bit of style, And rest ourselves a little while? IN CONTINUATION. THUS endeth Doctor Parr; and now again, To thee, as good a subject, flows the strain. Permit me, Peter, in my lyric canter, Just to speak Latin—‘tempora mutantur!’ Kings did not scorn to press your backs of yore; But now, with humbled neck and patient face, Tied to a thievish miller's dusty door, I mark thy fall'n and disregarded race. To chimney-sweepers now a common hack; Now with a brace of sand-bags on your back! No gorgeous saddles yours—no iv'ry cribs; No silken girts surround your ribs; No royal hands your cheeks with pleasure pat; Cheeks by a roguish halter prest— Your ears and rump, of insolence the jest; Dragg'd, kick'd, and pummell'd, by a beggar's brat. Thus, as I've said, your race is much degraded! And much too is the poet's glory faded! A time there was, when kings of this fair land, So meek, would creep to poets, cap in hand, Begging, as 'twere for alms, a grain of fame, To sweeten a poor putrifying name— But past are those rich hours! ah, hours of yore! Those golden sands of Time shall glide no more. Yet are we not in thy discarded state, Whate'er may be the future will of Fate; Since, as we find by Pye (what still must pride us), Kings twice a year can condescend to ride us. AN AFTER-REFLECTION. NOW, world, thou seest the stuff of which I'm made: Firm to the honour of the tuneful trade; Leaving, with high contempt, the courtier class, To sing the merits of the humble ass. Yet should a miracle the palace mend, And high-nos'd Sal'sb'ry to the Virtues send, Commanding them to come and chat with kings; Well pleas'd repentant sinners to support, So help me, Impudence, I'll go to court! Besides, I dearly love to see strange things. PROËMIUM TO THE MAGPIE AND ROBIN RED-BREAST. How varied are our tastes; Dame Nature's plan, All for wise reasons, since the world began: Yes, yes, the good old lady acted right: Had things been otherwise, like wolves and bears, We all had fall'n together by the ears— One object had produc'd an endless fight. Nettles had strew'd life's path instead of roses; And multitudes of mortal faces, Printed with histories of bloody noses, Had taken leave of absence of the Graces. Now interrupting not each other's line, Your ride your hobby-horse, and I ride mine— You press the blue-ey'd Chloe to your arms, And I the black-ey'd Sappho's browner charms: Thus situated in our diff'rent blisses, We squint not envious on each other's kisses. Yet are there some exceptions to this rule: We meet with now and then a stubborn fool, Dragooning us into his predilections; As though there was no diff'rence in affections, And that it was the booby's firm belief, Pork cannot please, because he doats on beef! Again—how weak the ways of some, and sad! One would suppose the man-creation mad. Lo! this poor fellow, folly-drunk, he rambles, And flings himself into Misfortune's brambles, In full pursuit of Happiness's treasure; When, with a little glance of circumspection, A mustard grain of sense—a child's reflection— The fool had cours'd the velvet lawn of pleasure. Idly he braves the surge, and roaring gale; When Reason, if consulted with a smile, Had tow'd through summer seas his silken sail, And sav'd a dangerous and Herculean toil. Yes, as I've somewhere said above, I find, That many a man has many a mind. How I hate Drunkenness, a nasty pig! With snuff-stain'd neckcloth, without hat or wig, Reeling and belching wisdom in one's face! How I hate Bully Uproar from my soul, Whom nought but whips and prisons can control, Those necessary implements of grace! Yet altars rise to Drunkenness and Riot— How few to mild Sobriety and Quiet! Thou art my goddess, Solitude—to thee, Parent of dove-ey'd Peace, I bend the knee! O with what joy I roam thy calm retreat, Whence soars the lark amid the radiant hour, Where many a varied, chaste, and fragrant flow'r Turns coyly from rogue Zephyr's whisper sweet! Blest imp! who wantons o'er thy wide domain, And kisses all the beauties of the plain: Where, happy, mid the all-enlivening ray, The insect nations spend the busy day, Wing the pure fields of air, and crawl the ground; Where, idle none, the Jew-like myriads range, Just like the Hebrews at high 'Change, Diffusing hum of Babel-notes around! Where Health so wild and gay, with bosom bare, And rosy cheek, keen eye, and flowing hair, Trips with a smile the breezy scenes along, And pours the spirit of content in song! Thus tastes are various, as I've said before— These damn most cordially, what those adore. THE MAGPIE AND ROBIN RED-BREAST. A TALE. A Magpie, in the spirit of romance, Much like the fam'd reformers now of France, Flew from the dwelling of an old Poissarde; Where, sometimes in his cage, and sometimes out, He justified the revolution rout, That is, call'd names, and got a sop for his reward. Red-hot with monarch-roasting coals, Just like his old fish-thund'ring dame, He left the queen of crabs, and plaice, and soles, To kindle in Old England's realm a flame. Arriv'd at evening's philosophic hour, He rested on a rural antique tow'r, Some baron's castle in the days of old; When furious wars, misnomer'd civil, Sent mighty chiefs to see the devil, Leaving behind their bodies for rich mould, That pliable from form to form patroles, Making fresh houses for new souls. Perch'd on the wall, he cocks his tail and eye, And hops like modern beaux in country dances; Looks dev'lish knowing, with his head awry, Squinting with connoisseurship glances. All on a sudden, Maggot starts and stares, And wonders, and for somewhat strange prepares; But lo, his wonder did not hold him long— Soft from a bush below, divinely clear, A modest warble melted on his ear, A plaintive, soothing, solitary song— A stealing, timid, unpresuming sound, Afraid dim Nature's deep repose to wound; That hush'd (a death-like pause) the rude sublime. This was a novelty to Mag indeed, Who, pulling up his spindle-shanks with speed, Dropp'd from his turret, half-devour'd by time, A la Françoise, upon the spray Where a lone Red-breast pour'd to eve, his lay. Staring the modest minstrel in the face, Familiar, and with arch grimace, He conn'd the dusky warbler o'er and o'er, As though he knew him years before; And thus began, with seeming great civility, All in the Paris ease of volubility— ‘What—Bobby! dam'me, is it you, That thus your pretty phiz to music screw, So far from hamlet, village, town, and city, To glad old battlements with dull psalm ditty? ‘'Sdeath! what a pleasant, lively, merry scene! Plenty of bats, and owls, and ghosts I ween; Rare midnight screeches, Bob, between you all! Why, what's the name on't, Bobby? Dismal Hall? ‘Come, to be serious—curse this queer old spot, And let thy owlish habitation rot! Join me, and soon in riot will we revel: I'll teach thee how to curse, and call folks names, And be expert in treason, murder, flames, And most divinely play the devil. ‘Yes, thou shalt leave this spectred hole, And prove thou hast a bit of soul: Soon shalt thou see old stupid London dance; There will we shine immortal knaves; Not steal unknown, like cuckoos, to our graves, But imitate the geniuses of France. ‘Who'd be that monkish, cloister'd thing, a muscle? Importance only can arise from bustle! Tornado, thunder, lightning, tumult, strife; These charm, and add a dignity to life. That thou shouldst choose this spot, is monstrous odd. Poh, poh! thou canst not like this life, by G?!’ ‘Sir!’ like one thunder-stricken, staring wide— ‘Can you be serious, sir?’ the robin cried. ‘Serious!’ rejoin'd the magpie, ‘aye, my boy— So come, let's play the devil, and enjoy.’ ‘Flames!’ quoth the robin—‘and in riot revel, Call names, and curse, divinely play the devil! I cannot, for my life, the fun discern.’ ‘No!—blush then, Bob, and follow me, and learn.’ ‘Excuse me, sir,’ the modest hermit cried— ‘Hell's not the hobby-horse I wish to ride.’ ‘Hell!’ laugh'd the magpie, ‘hell no longer dread; Why, Bob, in France the devil's lately dead: ‘Damnation vulgar to a Frenchman's hearing— The word is only kept alive for swearing. Against futurity they all protest; And God and Heav'n are grown a standing jest. ‘Brimstone and sin are downright out of fashion; France is quite alter'd—now a thinking nation: No more of penitential tears and groans! Philosophy has crack'd Religion's bones. ‘As for your Saviour of a wicked world, Long from his consequence has he been hurl'd: They do acknowledge such a man, d'ye see; But then they call him simple Monsieur Christ. Bob, for thy ignorance, pray blush for shame— Behold, thy Doctor Priestly says the same. ‘Well! now thou fully art convinc'd—let's go.’ ‘What cursed doctrine!’ quoth the robin, ‘No— I won't go—no! thy speeches make me shudder.’ ‘Poor robin!’ quoth the magpie, ‘what a pudder! Be damn'd then, Bobby,’—flying off, he rav'd— ‘And,’ quoth the robin, ‘sir, may you be sav'd!’ This said, the tuneful sprite renew'd his lay; A sweet and farewell hymn to parting day. In Thomas Paine the magpie doth appear: That I'm Poor Robin, is not quite so clear. POSTSCRIPT. TO THE CANDID READER. I really think that this tale of the Magpie and Robin ought immediately to have followed the Remonstrance: but as disorder, instead of order, is the leading feature of my sublime lyric brethren of old, I shall take the liberty of sheltering myself under the wing of their sacred names. The fable was written in consequence of a strenuous application of a red-hot revolutionist to a poet in the country, pressing him to become a member of the order of confusion. AN APOLOGY FOR KINGS. As want of candour really is not right, I own my satire too inclin'd to bite: On kings behold it breakfast, dine, and sup— Now shall she praise, and try to make it up. Why will the simple world expect wise things From lofty folk, particularly kings? Look on their poverty of education! Ador'd and flatter'd, taught that they are gods; And by their awful frowns and nods, Jove-like, to shake the pillars of creation! They scorn that little useful imp call'd mind, Who fits them for the circle of mankind! Pride their companion, and the world their hate; Immur'd, they doze in ignorance and state. Sometimes, indeed, great kings will condescend A little with their subjects to unbend! An instance take:—A king of this great land In days of yore, we understand, Did visit Sal'sbury's old church so fair: An Earl of Pembroke was the monarch's guide; Incog. they travell'd, shuffling side by side; And into the Cathedral stole the pair. The verger met them in his blue silk gown, And humbly bow'd his neck with rev'rence down, Low as an ass to lick a lock of hay: Looking the frighten'd verger through and through, All with his eye-glass—‘Well, sir, who are you? What, what, sir:—hey, sir?’ deign'd the king to say. ‘I am the verger here, most mighty king The reader will be pleased to observe, that the verger, of all the sons of the church, was the only one entrusted with the royal intention!!!: In this cathedral I do ev'ry thing; Sweep it, an't please ye, sir, and keep it clean.’ ‘Hey? verger! verger! you the verger? hey?’ ‘Yes, please your glorious majesty, I be,’ The verger answer'd, with the mildest mien. Then turn'd the king about towards the peer, And wink'd, and laugh'd; then whisper'd in his ear, ‘Hey, hey—what, what—fine fellow, 'pon my word: I'll knight him, knight him, knight him—hey, my lord?’ Then with his glass, as hard as eye could strain, He kenn'd the trembling verger o'er again. ‘He's a poor verger, sire,’ his lordship cry'd: ‘Sixpence would handsomely requite him.’ ‘Poor verger, verger, hey?’ the king reply'd: ‘No, no, then, we won't knight him—no, won't knight him.’ Now to the lofty roof the king did raise His glass, and skipp'd it o'er with sounds of praise; For thus his marv'ling majesty did speak: ‘Fine roof this, master verger, quite complete; High—high and lofty too, and clean and neat: What, verger, what? mop, mop it once a week!’ ‘An't please your majesty,’ with marv'ling chops; The verger answer'd, ‘we have got no mops In Sal'sb'ry that will reach so high.’ ‘Not mop, no, no, not mop it,’ quoth the king— ‘No, sir, our Sal'sb'ry mops do no such thing; They might as well pretend to scrub the sky.’ MORAL. This little anecdote doth plainly show That ignorance, a king too often lurches; For, hid from art, Lord! how should monarchs know The nat'ral history of mops and churches? STORY THE SECOND. From Sal'sb'ry church to Wilton House so grand, Return'd the mighty ruler of the land— ‘My lord, you've got fine statues,’ said the king. ‘A few! beneath your royal notice, sir,’ Replied Lord Pembroke—‘Stir, my lord, stir, stir; Let's see them all, all, all, all, ev'ry thing. ‘Who's this? who's this?—who's this fine fellow here?’ ‘Sesostris,’ bowing low, replied the peer. ‘Sir Sostris, hey?—Sir Sostris?—'pon my word! Knight or a baronet, my lord? One of my making?—what, my lord, my making?’ This, with a vengeance, was mistaking! ‘Se-sostris, sire,’ so soft, the peer reply'd— ‘A famous king of Egypt, sir, of old.’ ‘Poh, poh!’ th' instructed monarch snappish cry'd, ‘I need not that—I need not that be told.’ ‘Pray, pray, my lord, who's that big fellow there?’ ‘'Tis Hercules,’ replies the shrinking peer. ‘Strong fellow, hey, my lord? strong fellow, hey? Clean'd stables!—crack'd a lion like a flea; Kill'd snakes, great snakes, that in a cradle found him— The queen, queen's coming! wrap an apron round him.’ Our moral is not merely water-gruel— It shows that curiosity's a jewel! It shows with kings that ignorance may dwell: It shows that subjects must not give opinions To people reigning over wide dominions, As information to great folk, is hell: It shows that decency may live with kings, On whom the bold virtú-men turn their backs; And shows (for num'rous are the naked things) That saucy statues should be lodg'd in sacks. ADDRESS TO MY BOOK, AN ELEGY. Child of my love, go forth, and try thy fate: Few are thy friends, and manifold thy foes! Whether or long or short will be thy date, Futurity's dark volume only knows. Much criticism, alas! will be thy lot! Severe thine ordeal, I am sore afraid! Some judges will condemn, and others not: Some call thy form substantial—others, shade. Yes, child, by multitudes wilt thou be tried! Wise men, and fools, thy merits will examine: Those, through much prudence, may thy virtues hide; These, through vile rancour, or the dread of famine. Prov'd will it be indeed (to make thee shrink) What metal Nature in thy mass did knead: A melting Called eliquation. process will be us'd, I think— That is to say, large quantities of lead. By some indeed will nitre's fuming spirit Be o'er thy form so sweet, so tender, thrown; Perchance a master hand may try thy merit; Perchance an imp by folly only known. Now, now I fancy thee a timid hare, Started for beagles, hounds, and curs, to chase! A mongrel dog may snap thee up unfair; For spite and hunger have but little grace. Long are thy legs (I know), and stout for running; And many a trick hast thou within thy brain; But guns and greyhounds are too much for cunning, Join'd to the rav'nous pack of Thomas Paine! And now a lamb!—What devils now-a-days The butch'ring shop of criticism employs! Each beardless villain now cuts up, and flays! A gang of wanton, brutal, 'prentice boys! Ah me! how hard to reach the dome of Fame! Knock'd down before she gets half way, poor muse! For many a lout that cannot gain a name, (Rebus and riddle-maker) now reviews! Poor jealous eunuchs in the land of taste, Too weak to reap a harvest of fair praise; Malicious, lo, they lay the region waste; Fire all they can, and triumph o'er the blaze! Too oft, with talents blest, the cruel few Fix on poor Merit's throat, to stop her breath: How like the beauteous fruit The mortifying powers of dew or rain falling from the manchineel tree, are universally known., that turns of dew The life ambrosial, into drops of death! Sweet babe, to Weymouth shouldst thou find thy way! The king, with curiosity so wild, May on a sudden send for thee, and say, ‘See, Charly, Peter's child—fine child, fine child: ‘Ring, ring for Schwellenberg—ring, Charly, ring; Show it to Schwellenberg; show, show it, show it— She'll say, ‘Got dem de saucy stoopid ting, I hate more worse as hell what come from poet.’ Yet will some courtiers all at once be glad! Leeds, Hawksb'ry, Sal'sb'ry, Brud'nell, will rejoice; Forget how oft thy brothers made them mad, And echo through the realm the royal voice. And then for me his majesty may send (Making some people grumble in their gizzards); With Drake's new place, perchance, thy sire befriend; First fly-catcher to good Queen Charlotte's lizards The story of the lizards is as follows:—At a board of green cloth lately, which assembled, as usual, with due decorum, to deliberate on the species of food proper to be given to the lions of Buckingham-house, the solemnity of the meeting was interrupted by the sudden gothic irruption, and self-introduction, of a servan of Sir Francis Drake, one of the honourable board; which servant, a true Devonshire dumplin, opening an ell-wide pair of jaws, exclaimed thus: ‘Zur Vrancis, I'm a zent to ax if yow've a cort For caught. enny Any. more vlees Flies.—Have ye cort enny, Zur Vrancis?’ The baronet hemmed, winked, nodded, knitted his brows, stared, shrugged up his shoulders, blew his nose, bit his lips at poor numps: but all the face-making hints were thrown away.—‘Why, Zur Vrancis, I zay,’ continued numps, ‘Madam Zwellingburg wanth to know if yow've a nabb'd enny more vlees?’ The board stood amazed!—Sir Francis blushed for the first time. At length, recovering from his confusion, and bidding the fellow in an angry tone, go about his business, he very candidly informed the board, that her majesty had lately received a present of lizards; that she had ordered Mistress Schwellenberg to catch flies for them; but that, to oblige Mistress Schwellenberg, who kindly invited him to dine with her three or four times a week, he promised to assist her in her fly-hunt; in short, to be her deputy fly-catcher, and not first fly-catcher, as the elegy erroneously proclaimeth.! MORE MONEY! OR ODES OF INSTRUCTION TO MR. PITT; WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER CHOICE MATTERS. ? Quid non mortalia pectora cogis. Auri sacra fames? VIRGIL. O gold! thou precious fascinating evil, Say, with what soul hast thou not play'd the devil! Flectere si nequeo superos, A cheronta movebo. VIRGIL. Go to the House—beg, threaten, nay, compel for't: We must have money, though we shake all Hell for't. READER, The rumour of an intended and speedy application to Parliament for more money for the king, gave birth to the following Odes. Though by no means an advocate for Mr. Paine's violent system of revolution, I am too much the poet of the people, not to sing for a reformation. To the Odes is subjoined a sort of make-weight poetry. As the pieces are alluded to in the Odes, I deemed it not amiss to publish them—To be sure, they add to the price as well as the bulk of the pamphlet; but, as I still profess myself free from political corruption, notwithstanding a wicked report to the contrary (for great poets as well as great kings may be traduced), I flatter myself that thou wilt be proud of the opportunity of paying a small tribute to public virtue. P. P. ODE I. More money wanted?—'tis a brazen lie; 'Tis Opposition's disappointed cry: A poison'd shaft to wound the best of kings— More money! 'tis a poor invented story, To cloud with dire disgrace the king of glory— Damn'd shears to clip his Fame's exalted wings. More money!—'tis a little dirty tale, To sink of popularity the gale That wafts the name of George to utmost earth; A snake that should be strangled in its birth. More money!—'tis a paltry trick so mean, To make us sick of our good king and queen! We have no more to give—a truce to grants, That make the state a field devour'd by wants Another word for a mole.: The rust that eats the cannon—the rank weed— That dares the vessel's course sublime impede; The worm that gnaws its native keel, th' ingrate, And opes the world of waters for its fate; A spreading cancer that demands the knife; That, wolf-like, preys upon the nation's life. More money!—what a sound!—the solemn bell That tolls the constitution's knell. Clap a hot iron on the patriot tongues, For loading spotless majesty with wrongs: Nay, tear those tongues, th' offenders, from their holes, Foul pumps, that pour the froth from poison'd souls, The monarch scorns to ask a penny more— Tax'd to the eyes, his groans the state deplore: Away, then, defamation's baleful breath, That blows on virtue's bud, the blight of death. Yet should it happen that the best of kings Should whisper to his minister strange things, And bid thee money ask, the tempting curse; Then firmly thou, the nation's steward, say (With rev'rence due to royalty, I pray), ‘Dread sir, have mercy on your people's purse. ‘O king, your calculations have misled ye: Millions on millions you have had already. Oh! let Discretion This is fruitless advice, I fear—The passions are too powerful for the gentle virtues. See my beautiful address to those ladies in this work. from the virtue band Be call'd to court, to take you by the hand. ‘You really do not know how rich you are: Your wealth so wondrous makes your subjects stare, Squeez'd from great cities, towns, and hovels: Hawksb'ry and Coutts can show such heaps of treasure, Such loads of guineas for the royal pleasure, Heav'd into iron chests with shovels! Then how can majesty be poor? Your coffers, sir, are running o'er.’ ODE II. Say to the king (but with profound respect, For who would manners unto kings neglect?), ‘Dread sir, to hospitals you little grant, Your magic name supplying every want— And then how seldom 'tis you give a treat! And then your mutton, veal, and beef, you kill, The stomachs of your favoured few to fill— And butchers swear 'tis very pretty meat. ‘And lo, you kill your own delightful lambs; And beat old Bakewell We have more reverence than to say, a brother grazier of the north. in the breed of rams, And never wish to keep a thing for finery: Thus are parterres of Richmond and of Kew Dug up for bull and cow and ram and ewe, And Windsor Park, so glorious, made a swinery. ‘And lo, your dairy thriving, let me say, As not one drop of milk is giv'n away— So says your little dairy maid so sweet, Whose beauties many a smile so gracious meet; And smiling like the blooming May, Who shows the milk-score ev'ry day. How then can majesty be poor? Your chests, sir, must be running o'er. ‘Your oratorios, that expenses bred, And Duke of Cumberland By the death of the duke, a large annual income reverted to his majesty., so dear, are dead, That gave ('tis said) your majesty much pain— The nation kindly paid your doctors' bills, I mean the Willisses for toil and pills, That brought you to your wisdom, sire, again— Then how can majesty be poor? Your coffers must be running o'er. ‘Cabbage and carrot without end, The Windsor gard'ners Not now.—See the Progress of Admiration. daily send; Proud that their vegetables load the board Of Britain's high and mighty lord! ‘Of this, their glad posterity shall boast; For such an honour never should be lost— Thus shall they cry in triumph to their neighbours, Crown'd were our great great great forefathers' labours; Whose praise through Fame's long trumpet ever rings, For giving cabbages to kings! ‘Presents of ev'ry sort of thing are made, Without the slightest danger of offending Either from gentlemen, or men in trade; Your majesties are both so condescending— Folks for acceptance never beg and pray: For presents never yet were turn'd away. ‘People meet much encouragement indeed, For sending rarities and pretty things; Although such rarities you do not need— Such is the sweet humility of kings. Then how can majesty be poor? Your coffers must be running o'er. ‘Card-entertainment 'tis you chiefly give, By which the chandlers scarce can live— For soon as e'er you leave the little rout, The candles are immediately blown out! So quickly seized on by some candle-shark, Ladies and gentlemen are in the dark At the breaking up of a royal card-party, this is constantly done:—the poor maids of honour, and the gentlemen, may grope their way how they can.. Where what has happen'd, Heav'n alone can tell, As darkness oft turns pimp t'undo a belle.’ ODE III. Say to thy king (but, as I've said before With due respect), ‘By G?, you can't be poor. Sometimes a little concert is made up, Where nought is giv'n to eat or sup— Where music makes an economic pother; Where, with a solitary tweedle tweedle, A pretty melancholy fiddle Squeaks at the absence of his little brother, Whose presence would be much enjoy'd, But costs too much to be employ'd! Where Fischer's instrument (a frugal choice) Serves both for hautboys and for voice— As Billington and Mara, to the king, And that perverse Storace would not sing. When Monsieur Nicolai, his majesty's first favourite, first fiddle, and first news-monger, went with his majesty's commands to Madam St?????, to assist at a sort of a concert at Buckingham-house, the songstress, smiling on him with the most ineffable contempt, asked him, ‘What, Nicolai, I am to sing at the old price, I suppose?’ meaning nothing, —‘My compliments to your master and mistress, and tell them I am better engaged.’ ‘Lo! by some woman's order (fie upon her!) The pretty, harmless, modest maids of honour Are forc'd to furnish for their beds, the sheet; The pillow-cases too, says Fame, By order of some high commanding dame, To whose sweet soul economy is sweet. ‘Dear maids of honour! what a sin of sins, That Britain can't accomodate your skins! ‘Poor Generosity is sadly lam'd; And yet the noble beast was ne'er rode hard— Pale, cold Œconomy seems quite asham'd, Who never plays an idle card: Nay, Avarice, her mother, with surprise Turns up the whites, so sad, of both her eyes. ‘To wit you nothing give—to learning nought: Lo, in his garret, Mathematics pines, Where, hungry after bread and cheese and thought, He forms with brother spiders useless lines. ‘Th' expense of new-year's ode is felt no more! Thus is that needless, tuneless hubbub o'er: All praise must centre in the birth-day song: The virtues must be lump'd together—yes! And then (if subjects may presume to guess) The laureat need not make it very long. ‘A load of praise is nauseous stuff— Sire, don't you think, at times, one line enough? What's christen'd merit, often wants a crutch— Thus then a single line may be too much. ‘In vain the first of poets tunes his pipe; His whistle ne'er squeez'd sixpence from your gripe— Vain all epistles, vain his heav'nly odes: No, no! poor Peter may his strain prolong; The dev'l a farthing will reward his song, The song that should have celebrated gods! ‘In vain for royal patronage he sigh'd: In vain (some say) the modest bard apply'd To gain his book your patronizing name— And if this bard, whom all the Nine inspire, Instead of generous oil to feed his fire, Finds cold cold water flung upon his flame: If he, ah! vainly sighs for dedication, Woe to the witlings of the nation! ‘What though uncouth his shape, and dark his face; Whose breeding mother might for charcoal long; Still may the bard abound in verse and grace, And love for majesty, divinely strong. ‘Then heed not, sire, a clumsy form so fat, And sombre phiz, Dame Nature's work, unkind: Great mousing qualities, with many a cat, Of perfect ugliness, a lodging find. ‘Observe a fat, black, greasy lump of coal; Lo, to that most ungraceful piece of earth, A warm and lively lustre owes its birth; A flame in this world, pleasant to the soul. ‘To shapeless clouds, that, waggon-like, along Move cumb'rous, scowling on the twilight heav'n, At times, behold, the purest snows belong! To such, of rain the lucid drops are giv'n: Nay, 'mid the mass so murky and forlorn, Behold the lightning's vivid beam is born!’ Say—‘Mighty monarch, modest merit pines, ‘Hid like the useless gem amid the mines. Your gaacious smile, which all the world reveres, Your wealth had open'd her pale closing eye, Which hope once brighten'd with a spark of joy, And cruel disappointment quench'd with tears.’ ODE IV. Then unto majesty shalt thou repeat The lines that are to majesty a treat, Proverbs that œconomic souls revere; To wit—‘A pin a day's a groat a year’— ‘A little saving is no sin’— ‘Near is my shirt, but nearer is my skin’— ‘A penny sav'd, a penny got’— ‘'Tis money makes the old mare trot’— Then say, ‘With such wise counsellors, I'm sure No monarch ever can be poor.’ Say too, ‘Great sir, your queen is very rich— Witness the di'monds lodg'd in ev'ry stitch Of madam's petticoat This famous petticoat affordeth a pleasant history —one part of which is, that it was watched all night by a certain great man, on a particular occasion, to prevent its being stolen., of broad effulgence; Where flame such jewels on its ample field, As only to her charms and virtues yield, So very noble, God's and man's indulgence!’ Now may'st thou raise thy tone a little higher— Not 'squire, for that's impertinent, but ‘Sire,’ Firm shalt thou say, ‘the realm is not a wizard, Quick with a word to make the guineas start, To please a monarch's gold-admiring heart— In short, Britannia grumbles in her gizzard. ‘Sire, let me say, the realm will smell a rat, And cry, “Oh! oh! I know what you are at— Is this your cunning, Master Billy Pitt? What, Master Billy try to touch his grace? To keep your most, most honourable place? Is this your flaming patriotic sit? “Thick as may be the head of poor John Bull, The beast hath got some brains within his skull; A pair of dangerous horns, too, let me add; Dare but to make the generous creature mad.” Thus may'st thou decently thy voice exalt— And add, ‘Soft fires, O monarch, make good malt; The kiln much forc'd, may blaze about our ears, And then may fate be busy with his sheers— For then, with all his fame, your daring 'squire May, rat-like, squeak unpitied in the fire.’ Proclaim that reputation is a jewel, And life, without it, merely water-gruel— Say, that a king who seeks a deathless name, Turns not to newspapers to find a fame; Where paragraphs (a ministerial job) Report the half-crown howlings of a mob. Inform the monarch, when he goes to heav'n, Verse to his parting spirit may be giv'n; Ev'n Peter's verse, for which a thousand sigh— Verse which the poet ev'n to brutes This is literally true. I, the lyric Peter, assert, that I have written a most beautiful elegy to an old friend, a dying ass, with more feeling than I could compliment the deaths of half the kings in Christendom. can give, To bid their lucky names immortal live, Yet to a king the sacred gift deny! Say, ‘Sire, we've crippled the poor people's backs; Dread sir, they are most miserable hacks— How 'tis they bear it all, is my surprise! I cannot catch another tax indeed, With all your fox-hounds noses, and my speed, Your humble greyhound, though all teeth and eyes. ‘The state, sir, you will candidly allow, Has been t'ye a most excellent milch cow; For you, ah! many a bucket has been fill'd— But trust me, sir, the cow must not be kill'd. ‘So numerous are your wants, and they so keen, That verily a hundred thousand pounds Seem just as in a bullocks mouth a bean! A pound of butter midst a pack of hounds! Have mercy on us, sir—you can't be poor— Your coffers really must be running o'er.’ Say, ‘Sire your wisdom is prodigious great! Then do not put your servant in a sweat— He hates snap-dragon—'tis a game of danger— The sound, more money, the whole realm appals; Still, still it vibrates on Saint Stephen's walls; Our beast, the public, soon must eat the manger.’ Say, ‘Good my liege, indeed there's no more hay— Kind-hearted king, indeed there's no more corn— Our hack, Old England, sadly falls away; Lean as old Rosinante and forlorn.’ Say, ‘Sire, your parliament I dare not meet; For verily I've some remains of grace— If forc'd with money-messages The cry of ‘More money, more money,’ brings to recollection a little dialogue, amongst the many, that happened between the king of the Mosquitoes and myself, in the Government-house at Jamaica, during the administration of the late Sir William Trelawny. —His majesty was a very stout black man, exceedingly ignorant, nevertheless possessed of the sublimest ideas of royalty; very riotous, and grievously inclined to get drunk. He came to me one day, with a voice more like that of a bullock than a king, roaring, ‘Mo drink for king, mo drink for king!’ P. P. King you are drunk already. KING. No! no! king no drunk—King no drunk—Mo drink for king—Broder George love drink (meaning the king of England.) P. P. Broder George does not love drink: he is a sober man. KING. But king of Musquito love drink—me will have mo drink—me love drink like devil—me drink whole ocean. to greet, Your majesty must lend me H?ry's face. ‘I know what parliament will say, so mad— “More money, Master Billy! very fine! The impudence of highwaymen, my lad, By G?! is perfect modesty to thine.” ‘Sire, sire, the moment that I mention money, I'm sure the answer will be “Ninny nonny.”’ ODE V. Now, Pitt, put forth a small prophetic sound; Say, ‘Kings should keep their state, but not be rich’— Yes, say, ‘they never should with wealth abound, As money might the royal mind bewitch.’ Say, ‘Gambling monarchs possibly may spring, And stocks be at the mercy of a king— And if for boroughs sigh their great affections, Rare business for the devil at elections! A monarch offering his own heads and notes— A king and cobbler quarrelling for votes!’ Then lift thine head, and also lift thine eyes, And drawing of thy mouth the corners down, Exclaim (as stricken with a deep surprise), ‘Not that I think a man who wears a crown Would act so meanly, sir, or ever did— No! God forbid, dread sovereign—God forbid!’ Such are my counsels, Pitt.—Thy king, perchance, May, smiling, hear thee oracles advance; And pitying thee for hinting reformation To such a king of such a nation, May stun thee with two proverbs all so pat— ‘What, what, Pitt—“Play a jig to an old cat?” What, preach—what, preach to me on money-wit! “Old foxes Reformation is a most difficult and dangerous subject.—Hazarding a critique on the work of a very eminent artist, some years ago, what was the consequence?—See the ode. want no tutors,” Billy Pitt.’ THE ROYAL BULLOCKS, A Consolatory and Pastoral Elegy.The following Elegy was written on the royal Scheme of fattening Cattle solely on Horse-Chesnuts, which (had it succeeded) must have been attended with prodigious savings. The Bullocks tried what they could do, but were forced to give up the point, and nearly the ghost! Ye horn'd inhabitants of Windsor Park, Where reign'd sweet hospitality of yore, Why are you not as merry as the lark? Why is it that so dismally you roar? Ah me! I guess the cause!—our glorious king Would fatten cattle in the cheapest way— It is, it is, horse-chesnuts!—that's the thing Which give each face the cloud of dire dismay. Say, do the prickles stab each gentle beard?— You wish t'oblige the king; but, ah! with pain You turn them round and round, to bite afeard, And faintly mumbling, drop them out again. Fain would I comfort ye with better meat— God knows I pity ev'ry plaintive tone— Gladly your gums with turnips would I greet, And give the fragrant hay to sooth each groan. Say, are the nuts too solid to be chew'd?— Of want of nut-crackers do ye complain? Ye make up awkward mouths upon your food; But plaint of ev'ry sort is pour'd in vain. Condemn'd on such hard fare to sup and dine, And often by its stubborn nature foil'd, Perhaps you wish it roasted, gentle kine, Or probably you wish it stew'd or boil'd. But coals cost money—labour must be sav'd— Know this would prove a great expense indeed: Ah! kine, by such œconomy close-shav'd, Your bellies grumble, and your mouths must bleed. Your leanness mortifies the king of nations: Displeas'd he wonders that you won't grow fat: Your high back-bones employ his speculations, Much your poor bellies exercise his chat. The man whose lofty head adorns a crown, That stoutly studies bullocks, pigs, and books, Wants much to see you knock'd by butchers down, And hung in fair array upon their hooks. Yet murm'ring creatures, life is vastly sweet— For life, were I a bullock, I should sigh: Much rather make a sacrifice to meat; Live on horse-chesnuts, than on turnips die. A MORAL REFLECTION On the preceding Elegy. HOW can the eye, in Nature's softness drest, So harden'd, see the different tribes around; Behold the grazing cattle all so blest, And lambkins mingling sport with sweetest sound; Then glist'ning, in a strain of triumph cry, ‘Your throats young gentlefolks, will soon be cut— You, sweet Miss Lamb, most speedily shall die— Soon on the spit, you, Master Calf, be put.’ How can the tongue, amid the mingled noise Of goose, duck, turkey, pigeon, cock and hen, Exclaim, ‘Aye, aye, good fowls, your cackling joys Soon cease, to fill with mirth the mouths of men? I cannot meet the lambkin's asking eye, Pat her soft neck, and fill her mouth with food, Then say, ‘Ere evening cometh, thou shalt die, And drench the knives of butchers with thy blood.’ I cannot fling with lib'ral hand the grain, And tell the feather'd race so blest around, ‘For me, ere night, you feel of death the pain; With broken necks you flutter on the ground.’ How vile!—‘Go, creatures of th' Almighty's hand; Enjoy the fruits that bounteous Nature yields; Graze at your ease along the sunny land; Skim the free air, and search the fruitful fields— ‘Go, and be happy in your mutual loves; No violence shall shake your shelter'd home; 'Tis life and liberty shall glad my groves; The cry of murder shall not damn my dome;’ Thus should I say, were mine a house and land— And lo, to me a parent should you fly, And run, and lick, and peck with love my hand, And crowd around me with a fearless eye. And you, O wild inhabitants of air, To bless, and to be blest, at Peter's call, Invited by his kindness, should repair; Chirp on his roof, and hop amidst his hall. No school-boy's hand should dare your nests invade, And bear to close captivity your young— Pleas'd would I see them flutt'ring from the shade, And to my window call the sons of song. And you, O natives of the flood should play Unhurt amid your crystal realms, and sleep: No hook should tear you from your loves away; No net surrounding form its fatal sweep. Pleas'd should I gaze upon your gliding throng, To sport invited by the summer beam; Now moving in most solemn march along, Now darting, leaping from the dimpled stream. How far more grateful to the soul the joy, Thus cheerful, like a set of friends, to treat ye, Than like the bloated epicure, to cry, ‘Zounds! what rare dinners!—God! how I could eat ye!’ ELEGY ON MY DYING ASS, PETER. Friend of my youthful days, for ever past, When whim and harmless folly rul'd the hour; Ah! art thou stretch'd amid the straw at last!— These eyes with tears thy dying looks devour. Blest, would I soften thy hard bed of death, And with new floods the fount of life supply. O Peter, blest would I prolong thy breath, Renew each nerve, and cheer thy beamless eye. But wherefore wish?—Thy lot is that of all— Thy friend who mourns must yield to Nature's law— Like thee must sink—and o'er each dark'ning ball, Will Death's cold hand th' eternal curtain draw. Piteous thou liftest up thy feeble head, And mark'st me dimly, with a dumb adieu— And thus amid thy hopeless looks I read, ‘Faint is thy servant, and his moments few— ‘With thee no longer blest, the lanes I tread— Those times, so happy, are for ever o'er— Ah! why should Fate so cruel out our thread, And part a friendship that must meet no more? Oh! when these lids shall close (the will of Fate) Oh! let in peace these aged limbs be laid— Mid that lov'd field which saw us oft of late, Beneath our fav'rite willow's ample shade. ‘And if my master chance to wander nigh, Beside the spot where Peter's bones repose; Oh! let your servant claim one little sigh— Grant this—and, blest, these eyes for ever close.’ Yes thou poor spirit, yes—thy wish is mine— Yes, be thy grave beneath the willow's gloom— There shall the sod, the greenest sod, be thine: And there the brightest flow'r of spring shall bloom. Oft to the field as health my footstep draws, Thy turf shall surely catch thy master's eye; There on thy sleep of death shall friendship pause, Dwell on past days, and leave thee with a sigh. Sweet is remembrance of our youthful hours, When innocence upon our actions smil'd!— What though ambition scorn'd our humble pow'rs, Thou a wild cub, and I a cub as wild? Pleas'd will I tell how oft we us'd to roam; How oft we wander'd at the peep of morn; Till night would wrap the world in spectred gloom, And Silence listen'd to the beetle's horn. Thy victories will I recount with joy; The various trophies by the fleetness won; And boast that I, thy playfellow, a boy, Beheld the feats by namesake Peter done. Yes, yes (for grief must yield at times to glee), Amidst my friends I oft will tell our tale; When lo, these friends will rush thy sod to see, And call thy peaceful region Peter's vale. AN ACADEMIC ODE. [This Ode was written some years since, and was mislaid; but is fortunately recovered.—It hinteth at the universal Rage for Reputation, and attacketh Painters, who pitifully wince at the gently-reforming Touch of Criticism.] Alas! who has not fondness for a name? Lo, Nature wove it in our infant frame! From ear-delighters, down to ear-confounders, Each vainly fancies he possesses killing tones; Ev'n from the Maras and the Billingtons, Down to the wide-mouth rascals crying flounders— Nay, proud too of that instrument the rattle, That draws the hobbling brotherhood to battle, Nay, watchmen deem their merits no way small, Proud of a loud, clear, melancholy bawl. Yes, yes! much vanity's in human nature— Like mad dogs, that abhor the water, The painters hate to hear their faults display'd— And though I sing them in the best of rhimes, Such are the reformation-cursing times, The foolish fellows really wish me dead. Now this is great depravity, I fear— My tale, too, proveth it, as noon-day clear. THE TALE OF VAN TRUMP. Mynheer Van Trump, who painteth very well, Flam'd at my gentle criticisms, like hell— ‘Poor vretch,’ cried Trump, ‘I'm much dat rogue's superiors— Ven he, poor lousy dog, be ded an rot, Van Trump by peeples vil not be forgot, But lif in all de mouths of my posteriors’— Meaning indeed by this severity, His name would live to all posterity. Upon a day, some goodly folks and fine, Arriv'd, to barter praise for beef and wine; Academicians were the wights, I trow, The very men to dine with Van and Vrow. To Madam Trump did fall the carving work— So sticking in a fowl's sweet breast her fork— ‘I wish this fork,’ quoth angry Madam Trump, Wriggling from side to side her angry rump, ‘Were now as deep in Peter Pindar's heart.’ ‘Vell zed—dat's clever—Jantelmans, dat's vit,’ Quoth Van—‘spake it vonce more, my dear, a bit— ‘Now don't you tink, sirs, dat my vrow's dam smart? Now, jantelmans, I ax you if you please,’ Roar'd Van, upstarting—catching fire like tinder— ‘Will drenk von dam goot bumper 'pon our knees— Come, sirs, “Damnation to dat Peter Pindar.”’ Plump down the great academicians fell, And hearty drank th' immortal bard to hell! Such, I'm asham'd to say, 's the dev'lish mind, Contaminating poor mankind. Here too a little moral may be seen— Reformers are good folks, the million hate; And who, if hang'd, or shot, or burnt, I ween, Repentant, find their folly out, too late. THE PROGRESS OF ADMIRATION; OR THE WINDSOR GARDENERS. When first their majesties to Windsor went, Lo, almost ev'ry mouth was rent— With what?—with gaping on the royal pair: Indeed from east and west and north and south, Arriv'd large cargoes both of eye and mouth, To feast on majesty their gape and stare. Not Punch, the mighty Punch, the prince of joke, E'er brought together such a herd of folk: Amongst the thousands full of admiration, Appear'd fair Windsor's gardening nation, Blazing with Loyalty's bright torches— They humbly came their majesties to greet, Begging their majesties to come and treat, On ev'ry sort of fruit, their grand allforches. The couple smil'd assent, and ask'd no questions— Resolv'd to gratify their great digestions. Forth went his majesty, so condescending— Forth went our gracious queen, the fruits commending— Munching away at a majestic rate. The gardeners saw themselves bespread with glory; Told unto all the ale-houses the story; Which houses did again the tale relate. Yes, they were all so pleas'd that their poor things Should find such favour in the mouths of kings— So happy at the sudden turn of fate, As though they all had found a great estate. With awe so stricken were the gardeners mute— So sharp they ey'd them as they ate their fruit— Marv'ling to find that such as wear a crown Had actions very much like theirs in eating; And that they mov'd, when pines and nect'rines greeting, Their jaws like other people up and down; And that, like other folks, they ate a deal— Making (that is to say) a ploughman's meal. And now the gardeners, all so glorious, wanted To send to majesty rare things—'twas granted. Both horse and foot so labour'd to embark it! So much indeed unto their graces came, In consequence of this most loyal flame, The palace look'd like Covent-garden market. And lo, their majesties went forth each day Their compliments to dainty fruits to pay: The gardeners met them with best looks and bows; And then the royal reputation rais'd— The vegetable wisdom highly prais'd— Of George the glorious, and his glorious spouse. They told of Windsor town the gaping throng, What taste did unto majesty belong; As how they pick'd the best—strange to relate too— As how their eyes were of such lofty stature; Fill'd with so much sublimity their nature, They look'd not on an onion or potatoe— Which show'd a noble patronizing spirit, And prov'd that even in fruit they favour'd merit. Reader, prepare to drop thy jaw with wonder; Prepare thee now to hear a sound like thunder; The gardeners, lo, with majesty grew tired! No more, their gracious visitors desir'd! In short, when monarchs did themselves display, The gardeners, bonâ fide, ran away; Finding a sort of vacuum 'mongst their fruit, That did not much their scheme of thriving suit. For majesty gives nought to subjects, mind— Honour and money would be much too kind: The royal smile, and guineas' glorious rays, Like Semele The story of Semele, not being known to every one, is this:—the young lady, ambitious of enjoying Jupiter in all his glory, perished amidst the sublime effulgence of the god., would kill them with the blaze. They now began exalted birth to smoke, And fancy monarchs much like common folk— Therefore no more, when majesties were coming, Whistling and laughing, smiling, singing, humming, They gap'd, and blessing their two happy eyes, Leap'd at their presence, just like fish at flies. Thus did those fellows run from queen and king; Which shows the changeful folly of mankind— By growing tir'd and sick of a good thing, To actual happinesses blind! For what in this our earthly world can spring, That's equal to a glorious king? What in this world of wonders can be seen, That's equal to a charming queen? To fancy otherwise, alas! what sin it is! From such profane opinion how I shrink!— There must be something great, for they too think They're gods, or cousins of divinities! No more the dogs the gard'ners ponder'd how To say fine words, and make a pretty bow: No more they felt a choaking in the throat: No more look'd up and down, and wink'd askew, Poor souls, and, silly, wist not what to do, When with such awe the royal visage smote. No, no! the scene was most completely alter'd, No longer like some stupid jack-ass halter'd, Beside a miller's door, or gate, or post, In seeming meditation lost, To majesty were drawn their heads so thick— No—they were off—all admiration-sick. Such is sad repetition, O ye gods! And this may really happen to my odes! Men of huge titles and exalted places, Should at a distance commonly be seen— Eyes should not be familiar with their faces; Then Wonder goes a courting to each mien. Lo, novelty's a barber's strap or hone, That keenness to the razor-passions gives: Use weareth out this barber's strap or stone; Thus 'tis by novelty, enjoyment lives. In love, a sweet example let us seek— I have it—Cynthia's soft luxuriant neck— Fix'd on the charm, how pleas'd the eye can dwell! How sighs the hand within the gauze to creep, Mouse-like, and on the snowy hills to sleep, Rais'd by the most delicious swell; Like gulls, those birds that rise, and now subside Borne on the bosom of the silver tide. But let the breast be common—all's undone; Wishes, and sighs, and longings, all are gone: Away the hurrying palpitations fly; Desire lies dead upon the gazeless eye. Sunk into insipidity is rapture! Thus finisheth of love the simple chapter. This is a pretty lesson, though not new; A lesson fit for Gentile or for Jew— For love, the cooing, sweet, persuasive pigeon, Gains all the globe indeed to his religion: Throughout the world his humble vot'ries pray, And worship him exactly the same way.— Other religions kill—are torn by strife— Love kisses, and, what's sweeter still, gives life! ADDRESS TO THE VIRTUES, AN ODE. Ah, Virtues! you are pretty-looking creatures; But then so meek and feeble in your natures!— Thou charming Chastity now, par exemple, Who guard'st the luscious lip, and snowy breast. And all that maketh wishing shepherds blest, Forbidding thieves on sacred ground to trample. Appear but Love, the savage, all is lost; Faint, trembling, blushing, thou giv'st up the ghost: Lo, there's an end of all thy mincing care! The field so guarded, in the tyrant's pow'r; Each fence torn down, despoil'd each mossy bow'r, All, all is rudely plunder'd, and laid bare. Virtues! you blunder'd on our world, I fear— Design'd for some more gentle sphere; Where the wild passions storm ye not, nor tease ye; Where ev'ry animal's a mild Marchesi. I know your parentage and education— Born in the skies—a lofty habitation— But for a perfect system were intended, Where people never needed to be mended. How could you think the passions to withstand, Those roaring blades, so out of all command, Whose slightest touch would pull you all to pieces? They are Goliahs—you but little Misses! Then pray go home again each pretty dear— You but disgrace yourselves by coming here. THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE. A mighty potentate, of some discerning, Inquisitive indeed! and fond of learning, From Windsor oft danc'd down to Eton College, To make himself a pincushion of knowledge; That is, by gleaning pretty little scraps Of Cæsar, Alexander, and such chaps. There would he oft harangue the master, On Homer, Virgil, Pindar, my relation, Fast as a jack-fly, very often faster— Now jack-flies have a sweet acceleration. Oft ask'd he questions about ancient kings— Nat'ral! because so like himself—great things! He ask'd if Cæsar ever did insist, That if his minister would keep his place, That minister should always have the grace To mind deficiencies of civil list; Whether great Cæsar ever sent his sons, To study all the classics and great guns, And bring of art and science home a store, To Gottingen (his money wisely hoarding), As Gottingen is vastly cheap for boarding Young gentlemen whose parents are but poor— He ask'd if Cæsar's soul was fond of knowing What all the neighbourhood was daily doing; What went into the pot, or on the spit— How much in house-keeping they yearly spent, And if, like honest folks they paid their rent, Or gave of victuals to the poor, a bit— If Cæsar ever to a brewhouse went, With lords and ladies of his court so grand, And hours on hops and hoops and hogsheads spent, So wise, with some great Whitbread of the land; And tarried till he did the brewer tire, And made the brewer's horse and dog admire; And curious draymen into hogsheads creeping, Sly rogues, and through the bung-holes peeping— Whether great Cæsar was so sly an elf, As from the very servants to inquire; And know much better than the 'squire himself, The business of each neighb'ring 'squire— As why the coachman Jerry went away; Which of the drivers Joan the cook defil'd; Which of the footmen with Susanna lay, And got the charming chamber-maid with child— He ask'd if Cæsar's servants all Were, cat-like, all good mousers, earn'd their wages; Sought news from street and tavern, bulk and stall, Like Nicolai, the prince of pages; And whether Cæsar, with ferocious looks, Found a poor trav'ling louse, and shav'd his cooks— If Cæsar's minister gave half-a-crown, To shoe-blacks, and the sweepers of the town, To howl, and swear, and clap him at the play; And when unto the senate-house he rode, To spread their ell-wide lantern jaws abroad, And roar most bull-like when he came away. He ask'd if Julius Cæsar's wife Had ever maids of honour in her life, Like any modern œconomic queen; And if, of saving wisdom full, The saving empress ever made a rule, So keen, indeed so very keen:— That all those honourable maids, Who wish'd to sleep in comfortable beds, Should purchase their own sheets and pillow-cases, To treat their gentle backs, and blooming faces— Whether great Cæsar lov'd humility, That is in subjects only, viz. nobility; And eke the commons, deem'd a vulgar mass, Form'd by the wisdom of Almighty God, To carry on their backs a heav'nly load, Just like a camel, elephant, or ass— If Cæsar cut up palaces for pens, And unto butch'ring strongly did incline; Sold geese and turkeys, ducks, and cocks and hens, And fatten'd cows, and calves, and sheep, and swine; In rams surpass'd him (of ram glory full), Or ever beat him in a bull. He ask'd if Cæsar did not find Some cunning fellow for a hind, Prepar'd with strange accounts to meet him, And in his pigs and sheep and bullocks cheat him; And whether Cæsar did not slily watch him— And what were Cæsar's traps to catch him— If, like Peg Nicholson, on mischief busy, A mantua-maker drew a rusty knife, To cleave the emperor in twain, the hussey, Fright'ning the emperor out of his life— He ask'd if Italy was half so blest As England, in that prince of painters, West; And if there ever liv'd in Rome's great town, A man who stole, like Reynolds, a renown; A man indeed, whose daubing brush Puts Painting, the sweet damsel, to the blush— Then ask'd if Cæsar ever had the heart To give a shilling to the glorious art. He ask'd if Cæsar, 'midst his dread campaigns, Felt bold, whene'er well dous'd by rushing rains; Not caring ev'n a single fig, Although they spoil'd a bran-new wig; Joining the doughty regiments of death, On some wild Wimbledon, or huge Blackheath. He ask'd if Cæsar ever star'd abroad (Instead of staring, as he ought, at home) For architects with trash the land to load, And raise of gaudy gingerbread a dome The Royal Academy.: Such as is rais'd by that rare Swede Sir Will, The grinning mouth of Ridicule to fill— Whether the curious Cæsar sent to Greece, For statues costing Heav'n knows what a-piece; Then putting under ground a world's rare boast A cast, and the only one, of the famous Farnese Hercules, having been procured by a considerable expense, as well as trouble, for the benefit of the students of the Royal Academy, and the admiration of the world in general, is now thrust away into a dark hole; the building being rather calculated for the support of butterflies, than heavy antiques. The following short dialogue was written on the occasion:— A Dialogue between two Statues, in an upper Room of the Royal Academy. First Statue. ‘What keeps old Hercules below, A fellow of such rare renown? Second Statue. ‘Plague take thee! hold thy tongue—for know, Should he come up, we all go down.’, To entertain a toad or ghost. Such were the questions, with a thousand more, He ask'd, to swell of knowledges the store; That fell like starlings on the ear, in flocks— Sure keys for opening Mother Wisdom's locks: Rare keys that ope the twilight vaults of time; A thief who, with a sacrilegious pride, Delighteth something ev'ry day to hide, Sacks full of prose and sweetly-sounding rhime. Such questions, with a manner quite unique, The monkey boys to mimic soon began— And lo, of mimicry the saucy trick, Like wildfire through the college ran. Lord! hinder them!—there could be no such thing— Thus ev'ry little rascal was a king! This, Fame, who seldom lessens sounds, did bear, With all its horrors, to the royal ear— The consequence, the school had cause to rue— To schools the monarch bade a long adieu; Of Eton journeys gave th' idea o'er, And, angry, never mention'd Cæsar more! ODES OF IMPORTANCE, &amp;c. TO THE SHOEMAKERS. TO MR. BURKE. TO IRONY. TO LORD LONSDALE. TO THE KING. TO THE ACADEMIC CHAIR. TO A MARGATE HOY. OLD SIMON, A TALE. THE JUDGES; or, THE WOLVES, THE BEAR, AND INFERIOR BEASTS: A FABLE. ? Sic positi, suaves miscetis odores. Sweet-briar, hawthorn, lilies, nettles, roses; What a nice bouquet for all sorts of noses! Ludimus innocuis verbis, nec lædere quenquam Mens nostra ? MARTIAL. My verse's sweetness, mildness, none deny: Lord! playful Peter would not wound a fly. RESIGNATION. An Ode to the Journeymen Shoemakers, who lately refused to work, except their Wages were raised. Sons of Saint Crispin, 'tis in vain! Indeed 'tis fruitless to complain.— I know you wish good beef or veal to carve: But first the hungry great must all be fed; Mean time, you all must chew hard, musty bread, Or, what is commonly unpleasant, starve. Your masters like yourselves, oppression feel— It is not they, would wish to stint your meal: Then suck your paws like bears, and be resign'd. Perhaps your sins are many; and if so, Heav'n gives us very frequently, we know, The great as scourges for mankind. Your masters soon may follow you, so lank— Undone by simple confidence in rank. The royal Richmond builds his state on coals; Sal'sb'ry, and Hawksb'ry, lofty souls, With their fair dames must have the ball and rout; Kings must our millions have, to make a glare; Whose sycophants must also have a share.— But pout not—'tis a libel, sirs, to pout— Clos'd be your mouths, or dread the jail or thong: You must not for your money have a song. Cease, cease your riots, pray, my friends: It answereth (believe me) no good ends.— And yet the time will come, I hope to God, When black-fac'd, damn'd oppression, to his den Shall howling fly before the curse of men, And feel of anger'd justice the sharp rod. Go home, I beg of ye, my friends, and eat Your sour, your mouldy bread, and offal meat; Till freedom comes—I see her on her way— Then shall a smile break forth upon each mien, The front of banish'd happiness be seen, And sons of Crispin, you once more be gay. Now go, and learn submission from your Bible; Complaint is now-a-day a flagrant libel. Yes, go and try to chew your mouldy bread— Justice is sick, I own, but is not dead. Let Grandeur roll her chariot on our necks, Submission, sweet humility bespeaks: Let Grandeur's plumes be lifted by our sighs— Let dice, and chariots, and the stately thrones, Be form'd of poor men's hard-work'd bones— We must contribute; or, lo, Grandeur dies. We are the parish that supports her show; A truth that Grandeur wishes not to know. Full many a time reluctantly, I own, I view our mighty rulers with a groan, Who eat the labours of us vulgar crew; Bask on our shoulders in their lazy state; And if we dare look up for ease, th' ingrate Look down, and ask us, ‘D?m'me, who are you? Now such forgetfulness is most unpleasant! The man who doth receive a hare or pheasant, Might somewhat, certainly, from manners spare, And say, ‘I thank ye for the bird or hare.’— But then I'm told agen, that Grandeur's sore At owning obligations to the poor— Such favours cut no figure in discourse: She thinks she might as well thank dogs and cats For finding partridges, and catching rats; And say, ‘I'm much oblig'd t'ye,’ to a horse. Lo, to the great we breathe the sigh in vain; A zephyr murm'ring through the hollow walls; Our tear, that tries to melt their souls, the rain That printless on the rock of ages falls! The lofty great must have the softest bed To lay the soft luxurious head; And from our bosoms we poor geese, so tame, Must pluck submissively the tender feather; Ourselves expos'd to nature's rudest weather, Deny'd the liberty to cry out, ‘Shame!’ Thus, whilst their heads the pillow's down imprint, Ours must be only bolster'd by a flint. You must not heed your children's hunger'd cry, Not once upon their little sorrows sigh— In tears their blubber'd faces let them steep, And howl their hunger and their grief to sleep. 'Tis impudence in babes to cry for bread— Lo, Grandeur's fav'rite dogs must first be fed!— See yon proud duchess—yet of late so poor, With not above ten thousand pounds a year: Behold, a hundred coaches at her door, Where Pharo triumphs in his mad career. We must support her, or by hook or crook— For lo, her husband was—a royal duke. We must support too her fine gold-lac'd crew, Behind her gilt coach, dancing Molly fellows, With canes and ruffles goodly to the view, And (suiting their complexions) pink umbrellas. It must be so; for lordly Grandeur rules— Lo! quality are gods, and mob are mules. I know you wish to see on gold, so good, King George's head, that many a want supplies; So very pleasant to his people's eyes, As pleasant as the head of flesh and blood. Money's a rattling sinner, to be sure: Like the sweet Cyprian girl (we won't say wh?e) Is happy to be frequently employ'd, And not content by one to be enjoy'd; Yet, like the great ones, with fastidious eye Seems of inferior mortals rather shy. Then go, my friends, and chew your mouldy bread: 'Tis on our shoulders courts must lift the head. Remember, we are only oxen yet— Therefore, beneath the yoke, condemn'd to sweat. But gradually we all shall change to men; And then!!! what then?—Ye heav'ns! why then The lawless sway of Tyranny is o'er— Pride falls, and Britons will be beasts no more! ODE TO BURKE. Ah, Burke! full sorry is the Muse indeed That thou art from the patriot phalanx fled! For what? To crouch and flatter queens and kings? Meanly to mingle with a courtier gang, That Infamy herself would scorn to hang— Such a poor squalid host of creeping things Has madness fir'd thy brain? Alas! return: Thy fault in sackcloth and in ashes mourn: Join not a court, and Freedom's foulest foes— Repentance, lo, shall try to wash thee white: Then howl not, Edmund, 'mid the imps of night: Swell not the number of a flock of crows. What murky cloud, the vapour black of courts (For many a cloud, the breath of kings supports) Attempts thy reputation's spreading beam? What bat-like demon, with the damned'st spite, Springs on thy fame, on Glory's sacred height, To souse it in Disgrace's dirty stream?— Alas! if majesty did gracious say, ‘Burke, Burke, I'm glad, I'm glad you ran away; I'm glad you left your party—very glad— They wish'd to treat me like a boy at school; Rope, rope me like a horse, an ass, a mule— That's very bad, you know, that's very bad.— ‘I hate the Portland junto—hate it, Burke— Poor rogues, poor rogues, that cannot draw a cork— Nothing but empty dishes, empty dishes— We've got the loaves and fishes, loaves and fishes.’ I say, if thus a mighty monarch spoke As usual—not by way of joke; Did not the speech so with'ring make thee shrink? Didst thou not inward say, ‘I've damn'd myself— ‘Why, what a miserable elf!’ And then upon each old acquaintance think; And with a sigh recall those Attic days, When wit and wisdom pour'd the mingled blaze! Burke, Burke, most easily do I discover Thou loathest the weak smile that won thee over— From Tr?ry borrow'd, ne'er to be return'd! Ev'n now thou art not happy at thy heart— It sighs for Wisdom's voice, and pants to part From fellows by the honest Virtues spurn'd. Thy tongue has promis'd friendship with a sigh— For, lo, th' interpreter of thoughts, thine eye Hangs heavy, beamless on the motley band— To whom thou stretchest forth thy leaden hand! Yes, slowly does that hand of friendship move: The startled courtiers feel no grasp of love: A cold and palsied shake of gratulation, As though it trembled at contamination! O Burke! behold fair Liberty advancing— Truth, Wit, and Humour, sporting in her train: Behold them happy, singing, laughing, dancing, Proud of a golden age again! When all thy friends (thy friends of late, I mean) Shall, flush'd with conquest, meet their idol queen, The goddess at whose shrine a world should kneel; When they with songs of triumph hail the dame, Will not thy cheek be dash'd with deepest shame, And conscience somewhat startled feel? Ah! will thine eye a gladsome beam display: Borrow from smooth Hypocrisy's a ray, To hail the long-desir'd return? Speak, wilt thou screw into a smile thy mouth, And welcome Liberty, with Wit and Truth; And for a moment leave thy gang to mourn? Yes, thou wilt greet her with a half-forc'd smile, Quitting thy virtuous company a while, To say, ‘Dear Madam, welcome—how dy'e do?’ And then the dame will answer with a dip, Scorn in her eye, contempt upon her lip, ‘Not much the better, Mister Burke, for you.’ ‘Poor Burke, I read thy soul, and feel thy pain— Go, join the sycophants that I disdain.’ ODE TO IRONY. O thou, with mouth demure and solemn eye, Who laughest not, thou quaker-looking wight But makest others roaring laugh outright, Thus chacing widow Sorrow, and her sigh— O thou who formest pills to purge the spleen No more in Britain must thou dare be seen! There was a time, but not like ours so nice, When thou could'st banish Folly, nay, and Vice— Leagu'd with thy daughter Humour, damsel quaint, And Wit, that could have tickled ev'n a saint. But times are alter'd! Certain greybeards say, ‘Ye vagabonds, you've had indeed your day; But never dare to show your face agen, To take vile liberties with lofty men. Grin, if you please—with joke the world regale— Yet mind, a critic hears you, call'd a jail.’ But, lo! fair Liberty divinely strong! A patriot phalanx leads the dame along. Thou, Wit, and Humour shall adorn her train— And let me proudly join the noble few; Whilst to the cause of glory true, The muse shall shout her boldest strain. Ev'n I, 'midst such a patriot band, Will gain importance through the land; Rise, from a poor extinguisher, a steeple— And, O Ambition, hear thy suppliant's prayer, A sprig of thy unfading laurel spare, And crown me, crown me poet of the people. ODE TO LORD LONSDALE Fie, fie, my lord! attack a saint-like poet! O, let not Askalon, nor let Gath know it! What by law bulldogs bid the lambkin groan! O Lonsdale! genuine poetry is rare, Half of our verse adulterated ware; I speak of others' verses, not my own. Ah! stop not, stop not Peter's tuneful throat! Hereafter he may warble in thy praise, Who so surpasseth thousands in his note, A philomel amidst a flock of jays. The banishment of Ovid into Thrace Did Cæsar's glory grievously disgrace; Dropp'd on his coat of arms a stain of ink, And made the honest pen of hist'ry shrink. Thou who shott'st Sergeant Bolton through the foot, At least did'st make the sergeant shoot himself: O think how thou mayst suffer in repute, By falling on a harmless rhiming elf! Revenge herself would blush at such a deed; For poets always were a dove-like breed. Fire at a great law sergeant—then let fly, Bounce, on a simple rhimer such as I, Great condescension verily requires: What sportsman at the pheasant aims, and then Hunts in his humble bush the twitt'ring wren? On grouse and grasshoppers what mortal fires! At London frequently we meet A lofty camel in the street, Moving with a state-unwieldiness along We also see a monkey on his hump, Now, with an arch grimace, from head to rump Skipping, and drawing wonder from the throng— Against Lord Chesterfield's grave maxim sinning, The merry grig, that is to say by grinning. Now this same camel, a well-judging beast, Feels not of goading ridicule the least; Calmly the ruminating creature goes, Poking his head, and shaking it in guise, Much like great Doctor Johnson, call'd the wise For pulling ev'ry Scotchman by the nose, When pond'rous moving through the northern track, With dapper Jemmy Boswell on his back. Now would not ev'ry mortal smile, To see this camel also full of bile Bouncing unhappily about, Dancing, and staring, grunting, kicking, moaning, And like a creature in the cholic groaning, Making for playful Jacko all this rout? When Hawk'sb'ry, Salisb'ry, Leeds, and more beside, Fearing the tinsel on the back of Pride Might tarnish by an acid drop of rhime, And consequently lose the magic rays That call forth Admiration's gape and gaze, And make her think she views the true sublime— I say, to majesty when those great lords Pour'd forth a foaming torrent of hard words; As, ‘Hang that Peter Pindar, if you please; Sire, make the graceless varlet understand What 'tis to smile at rulers of the land— A beggar that disgraces his own fleas. ‘Sire, sire, th' attorney-general's tiger gripe Would quickly stop the raggamuffin's pipe; Then for his laugh at grandeur let him swing.’ ‘No,’ quoth the king— ‘If I'm not hurt, my lords, you may be quiet: 'Tis for yourselves, yourselves, you wish the riot— Yes, yes, you fear, you fear, that Peter's muse Will hang your grandeurs in her noose. ‘No, no, my lords, M'Donald The attorney-general. must not squeeze him: You see I give up new-year odes, to please him, And faith, between me and the post and you, I fear the knave will get the birth-day too. ‘No, no—let Peter sing, and laugh, and live: I like to read his works—kings are fair game: What though he bites—'tis glorious to forgive.— Go, go, my lords, go, go, and do the same. ‘Should Peter's verse be in the right, Our conduct must be in the wrong— Poor, poor's the triumph of a little spite— We must not a hang a subject for a song. ‘My lords, my lords, a whisper I desire— Dame Liberty grows stronger—some feet higher; She will not be bamboozled, as of late— Aristocrate et la lanterne Are very often cheek by jowl, we learn, Within a certain neighb'ring bustling state: I think your lordships and your graces Would not much like to dangle with wry faces. ‘But mum, my lords—mum, mum, my lords—mum mum: You must be cautious for the time to come: The people's brains are losing their old fogs— Juries before the judges won't look slink— No, no—they fancy they've a right to think: They say, indeed they won't be driven like hogs. ‘No star-chambers, no star-chambers, for them— Slavery's the dev'l, and liberty a gem. You see, my lords, their heads are not so thick.— Take care, or soon you'll have a bone to pick; And p'rhaps you would not like this same hard bone; So let the laughing, rhiming rogue alone.’ Sweet Robin of the muse's sacred grove, Whose soul is buttermilk, and song is love; So blest when beauty forms the smiling theme; Who would'st not Heav'n accept (the sex so dear), Had charming woman no apartments there, Thy morning vision, and thy nightly dream— Mild minstrel, could their lordships call thee rogue, Varlet and knave, and vagabond and dog? What! try to bring thee, for thy harmless wit, Where greybeards in their robes terrific sit, With sanctified long fortune-telling faces, Whilst Erskine, eldest-born of Ridicule, From solemn Irony's bewitching school, Tears to un-judgelike grins, the hanging Graces. Meek poet, who no prostitute for price, Wilt never sanction fools, nor varnish vice; Nor rob the muse's altar of its flame, To brighten with immortal beams a king (If Freedom finds no shelter from his wing), And meanly sing a tyrant into fame! Thus, Lonsdale, thou behold'st a fair example Of greatness in a king—a noble sample! Thou cry'st, ‘What must I do? on thee I call.’— Catch up your pen, my lord, at once, and say, ‘Dear Peter, all my rage is blown away; So come, and eat thy beef at Lowther-Hall.’ ODE TO THE ACADEMIC CHAIR, ON THE Election of Mr. West to the Presidency. How art thou fallen, thou once high-honour'd Chair! Most hedgehog-like, thou bristlest up my hair.— But possibly I'm only in a dream: If so, immediately O let me wake; Good Morpheus, drag me from this sad mistake— Open my eyes, or lo, I shall blaspheme. By heav'ns! it is no vision—'tis too plain That thou, poor imp, art fated to sustain Of Benjamin th' abominable b?m What! after Reynolds, to take up with West! Th' antipodes thou seekest, I protest, From Jove's grand thunder, to an infant's drum; The lightning courser, to the creeping mole; The world's wide orbit, to a spider's hole; From some fair column, or Corinthian dome, Sunk to a dreary dungeon, or the tomb! And yet, on recollection, that old throne, In Westminster's fair choir for two-pence shown, Which bore the Edwards, Harrys of our isle, Has been oblig'd (a truth most melancholly!) To shrink beneath a leaden load of folly, And every meanness that can man defile. Thy virtue is gone out of thee, I ween! Thy brother chairs of late with humbled mien, That jealous envy'd thee thy tow'ring fame, All with one voice exclaim, And all the poignant pow'r of ridicule, ‘He is not equal to an old joint stool. ‘He who of late so lofty held his crest, Array'd so gorgeous in a crimson vest, He now is worse than us poor humble hacks, With not a single rag about our backs. ‘Get thyself burnt, thou sad degraded creature; Go, boil some poor old washer-woman's water; Or get thyself to skewers and crocksticks turn'd; To some dead beggar's coffin give each nail, And yield thy velvet to some strumpet's tail; For, know, thou should'st no longer be adorn'd.’ Thus speak thy brother chairs! and yet 'tis cruel, As thou would'st rather be cut up for fuel, Or rest the backs of beggars in the street: But lo, West fills thee, by his king's commands; Lov'd by his subjects—fear'd by foreign lands— And full of wisdom as an egg of meat! ‘I like West's works—he beats the Raphael school— I never lik'd that Reynolds—'twas a fool— Painted too thick—a dauber—'twon't, 'twon't pass— West, West, West's pictures are as smooth as glass: Besides, I hated Reynolds, from my heart: He thought that I knew nought about the art. ‘West tells me that my taste is very pure— That I'm a connoisseur, a connoisseur: I like, I like, I like the works of West.’— Thus doth our king, in sounds so gracious, cry: Which proves that kings with little can be blest, And give the wings of eagles to a fly! OLD SIMON. A TALE. Folks cannot be for ever sniv'ling—no! With fountain noses that for ever flow— The world would quickly be undone; Widows, and lovelorn girls, poor souls, would die; And for his rich old father, sob and sigh, And hang himself, perchaunce, a hopeful son; And for their cats that happ'd to slip their breath, Old maids, so sweet, might mourn themselves to death: Sorrow may therefore have her decent day, And smiling Pleasure come again in play. No! folks can't brood for ever upon grief: Pleasure must steal into her place at last; Thus then the heart from horror finds relief; Snatch'd from the cloud by which it is o'ercast. Thus was an anger'd lord my constant theme, My constant thought by day, my constant dream: Tears at his image oft burst out, with sighs: At length Charles Fox With the libel-bill; on which the lord chancellor wished to consult the judges. Few are the men candid enough to part voluntarily with power, however tyrannical—it must be torn from them. The judges have been rendered independent of the crown, by the people: now let them show their gratitude. appear'd—behold the change! No longer after Sorrow did I range, But on the smile of Pleasure cast mine eyes. Pleasure's a lass that will at length prevail: Witness the little pleasant following tale. Narcissa, full of grace, and youth, and charms, Had slept some years in good old Simon's arms; Her kind and lawful spouse, that is to say, Who, following of numbers the example, Wishing of sweet young flesh to have a sample, Married this charming girl upon a day. For from grey-headed men, and thin, and old, Young flesh is finely form'd to keep the cold. Thus of the pretty Shunamite we read, Who warm'd the good King David and his bed, Brought back his flagging spirits all so cool, And kept the King of Israel warm as wool— Indeed she warmer could the monarch keep, Than any thing belonging to a sheep. Most virtuous was Narcissa! lo, All purity from top to toe; As Hebe sweet, and as Diana chaste. None but old Simon was allow'd a kiss, Though hungry as a hound to snap the bliss; Nor squeeze her hand, nor take her round the waist: Had any dar'd to give her a green gown, The fair had petrified him with a frown; For Chastity, Lord bless us! is so nice— Pure as the snow, and colder than the ice. Thus then, as I have said before, Sweetly she slept, and probably might snore, In good old Simon's unmolesting arms: Some years, with this antique of Christian clay, Did pass in this same tasteless, tranquil way— Ah, gods! how lucky for such tender charms! Yes, very fortunate it seem'd to be; For, had Narcissa wedded some young chaps, Their impudencies, all forsooth so free, Had robb'd her eyes by night of half their naps. And yet, on second thoughts (sometimes the best), Ladies might choose to lose a little rest, Keep their eyes open for a lover's sake, And thus a sacrifice to Cupid make. It pleas'd at length the Lord who dwells on high, To bid the good old simple Simon die; Sleep with his fathers, as the Scripture has it: Narcissa wept, that they were doom'd to part, Blubber'd and almost broke her little heart— So great her grief that nothing could surpas it. Not Niobe mourn'd more for fourteen brats— Nor Mistress Tofts The famous singer. She died a few years since at Venice, and left to every cat a legacy., to leave her twenty cats. Not to his grave was poor old Simon hurried; No! 'twas a fortnight full ere he was buried. 'Tis said old Simon verily did stink. A pretty sermon on th' occasion giv'n Prov'd his good works, and that he was in heav'n: Scraps too of Latin did the parson link. Unto the funeral sermon, all so sweet, The congregation and the dead to greet: For every wife that is genteelly bred Orders a sprig of Latin for the dead. And of a sprig of Latin what's the cost?— A poor half-guinea at the most. Latin sounds well—it is a kind of balm, That honoureth a corpse just like a psalm; And 'tis believ'd by folks of pious qualm, Heav'n won't receive a soul without a psalm.— But now for poor Narcissa, wailing dove! Nothing—no, nothing equall'd her dear love: Such tears and groans burst forth, from eyes and mouth; Where'er she went, she was so full of woes, Just like a dismal day that rains and blows From every quarter—east, west, north and south; And like some fountains were Narcissa's eyes, Lifting a constant water to the skies. Resolv'd to keep his image near her breast, She got him beautifully carv'd in wood; Made it her bed-fellow, to sooth her rest, And thought him much like him of flesh and blood, Because it lay so wonderfully quiet, And like old Simon never bred a riot. 'Twas for some weeks, sweet soul, it was her plan Nightly to hug her dear old wooden man: Yet, verily, it doth my fancy strike, That buxom widows, full of rich desires, Full of fine prancing blood, and Love's bright fires, Might such a wooden supplement dislike: But who can answer for the sex, indeed? Of things most wonderful we sometimes read! It came to pass, a youth admir'd the dame— Burning to satisfy a lawless flame, With much more passion fill'd, the rogue, than grace. What did he? Brib'd, one night, Narcissa's maid, And got his limbs, so dev'lish saucy, laid, Th' impostors, in poor wooden Simon's place: Susan, though born amongst a vulgar tribe, Knew nature, and the nature of a bribe.— The dame came up, delicious, and undrest, When Susan's candle suddenly went out— Misfortunes, sometimes, will attend the best— No matter—sweet Narcissa made no rout.— She could not miss the way, although 'twas dark, Unto her bed, and dear old bit of bark. In slipp'd the fair, so fresh, beneath the sheets, Thinking to hug her dear old oaken love— But, lo! her bed-fellow with kisses greets! She trembles, like an aspen, pretty dove— In short, her terror kept her so much under, She could not get away—and where's the wonder? Since 'tis an old and philosophic notion, That terror robbeth all the limbs of motion. The upshot of the matter soon was this— Her horrors sunk, and died, at ev'ry kiss; And, 'stead of wishing for the man of wood, She seem'd to relish that of flesh and blood. Next day, but not indeed extremely soon— Some five or six o'clock—the afternoon, Susan came tapping at the chamber-door:— (Now this was very prudent, to be sure; It had been foolish to have tapp'd till then) ‘Well, madam, what d'ye choose for dinner, pray?’ ‘Fish, flesh, and fowl,’ the lady quick did say— ‘The best of ev'ry thing—I don't care when.’ ‘But, madam, I want wood to make a fire— 'Tis rather late—our hands we have no time on.’ ‘Oh,’ cried Narcissa, full of her new 'squire, ‘Then, Susan, you may go and burn old Simon.’ ODE TO THE KING. Written some Time since. An't please your majesty, 'twas rumour'd lately That you had got it in your head so stately, That we must have a law-suit—God forbid it! Whether 'tis Hawksb'ry, or his Grace of Leeds, Invented such intended hostile deeds, Or whether the more lofty Salisb'ry did it, I say not—but great lords are giv'n to chatter! So, sir, I deem it all a lying matter. There's my Lord Bluff too—Cardigan the great, Whose face Dame Nature never meant should cheat; Who, if aught hurts the king, doth shrink and wince, As faithful to his sov'reign as his prince! Brimfull of loyalty his noble breast; Large and fermenting like a tub of yeast! Glad at the aloes thrown into my cup, He says too that you mean to eat me up. That heartily they wish it, I don't doubt— Most loyal seem they in your cause, and stout! You can't think how they seem to take your part; And at the poet, as the devil, start— I say the devil, sir, because some peers Are with the devil oft in large arrears: They open'd an account, sir, long ago— And Satan's a great creditor, I know. Yes, hugely do they seem to take your part, And at the poet, as a demon, start; Just like a horse or ass at some wild beast Prepar'd to jump upon their backs, and feast. This Loyalty's a bird of passage, sire; Likes the sun's eye—a comfortable fire! Warm'd by this fire, so cheerful doth she sing The hack'd old ballad, call'd ‘God save the king.’ But be in trouble, sir, soon, very soon The jade will drop the good old tune. Yes, much your lords are like the birds of May, Crying, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, so gay; But if a gloomy month appear, so rough, And frost, and snow, and storms lay waste the land, Where are the pretty birds with notes so bland? Off! Spit on the courtiers, when with praise they greet: What from their mouth's unhallow'd censer flows? Instead of Fame's perfume, so passing sweet, Lo, putrid dunghills smoke beneath thy nose; Good God! that man should so far lose his nature, To beg Hypocrisy to mould each feature— Crawl like the meanest reptile of the plain; Kick'd, cur-like whipp'd, and whistled back again! You tell me that such reptiles you abhor, And that you never see my fancy'd cur. Indeed, sir!!! then I strongly do surmise On levee-days you always shut your eyes. ODE TO A MARGATE HOY. When Virgil shipp'd himself for Greece; Whether to 'scape the bailiffs, I can't tell— Or libels wrote, got drunk, and broke the peace; But Horace wrote an ode, to wish him well. Whether, like Margate Hoys, the ship was cramm'd With Roman quality, no hist'ries know it; But Horace swore she might as well be damn'd, As show her nose again without the poet: In the same verse he breathed a pious wish To blust'ring Boreas, and the king of fish Neptune.. Now if a bard, and that a heathen too, Could offer verse to make old Ocean quiet, Instruct the great king Neptune who was who, And bid the god of mack'rel breed no riot; A Christian bard may give a hoy an ode, So oft with valuable people stow'd, That, thick as rats or maggots, from Wool Quay, Crawl down the ladder to their wat'ry way! Go, beauteous Hoy, in safety ev'ry inch! That storms should wreck thee, gracious Heav'n forbid! Whether commanded by brave Captain Finch, Or equally tremendous Captain Kidd. Go, with thy cargo—Margate town amuse; And God preserve thy Christians and thy Jews! Soon as thou gett'st within the pier, All Margate will be out, I trow, And people rush from far and near, As if thou hadst wild beasts to show. O Venus, queen of ev'ry kissing joy, Beneath thy soft protection take the hoy; Protect each damsel from the dangerous briue; For many a nymph it holds, thou callest thine. Alas! the little Loves, and blooming Graces, Would all put on most melancholy faces, Should Ocean, hostile to the soft desires, O'erwhelming, quench for aye their am'rous fires. My good friend Johnson—Mesdames Windsor, Kelly, Who for the public, let me tell ye, And through St. James's street, the Park, Pall-Mall, Oft lead their lovely giggling tits along, A pretty pleasing fascinating throng— Much would they grieve to find the voyage fail: Like three stout men of war for safety made, From port to port, who convoy the fair trade; Or three protecting ducks, that guard their brood, And lead their cackling young to pick up food. Yet not alone would those be taken napping— Great were the loss of gentlefolks from Wapping, Who fond of travel, unto Margate roam, To gain that consequence they want at home. At Margate, how like quality they strut! Nothing is good enough to greet their jaws; Yet, when at home, are often forc'd, God wot, To suck like bears a dinner from their paws— Forc'd on an old joint-stool their tea to take, With treacle 'stead of sugar for their gums; Butt'ring their hungry loaf, or oaten cake, Like mighty Charles of Sweden, with their thumbs. But Hoy, inform me—who is she on board That seems the lady of a first-rate lord, With stomach high push'd forth as if in scorn, Like craws of ducks and geese o'ercharg'd with corn— Dress'd in a glaring, gorgeous damask gown, Which roses, like the leaves of cabbage, crown; With also a bright petticoat of pink, To make the eye from such a lustre shrink? Yes, who is she the Patagonian dame, As bulky as of Heidelberg the tun! Her face as if by brandy taught to flame, In blaze superior to the noon-day sun— With fingers just like sausages, fat things; And loaded much like curtain-rods with rings? Yes, who is she that with a squinting eye Surveys poor passengers that sick'ning sigh; Sad, pale-nos'd, gaping, puling, mournful faces, Deserted by the blooming smiling graces; That, reaching o'er thy side, so doleful throw The stomach's treasure to the fish below? 'Tis Madam Bacon, proud of worldly goods, Whose first spouse shav'd and bled—drew teeth, made wigs; Who, having by her tongue destroy'd poor suds, Married a wight that educated pigs! But hark! she speaks! extremely like a man! Raising a furious tempest with her fan— ‘Why, captain, what a beastly ship! good God! Why, captain, this indeed is very odd! Why, what a grunting dirty pack of doings! For Heav'n's sake, captain, stop the creatures' sp?w?ings.’ Now hark! the captain answers—‘Mistress Bacon, I own I can't be with such matters taken; I likes not vomitings no more than you; But if so be the gentlefolks be sick, A woman hath the bowels of Old Nick, Poor souls, to bung their mouths—'twere like a Jew.’ Majestic Mistress Bacon speaks agen!— ‘Folks have no bus'ness to make others sick: I don't know, Mister Captain what you mean About your Jews and bowels of Old Nick:— If all your cattle will such hubbub keep, I know that I shall leave your stinking ship. ‘Some folks have dev'lish dainty guts, good Lord! What bus'ness have such cattle here aboard? Such gang indeed to foreign places roam! 'Tis more becoming them to sp?w at home.’ But hark! the captain properly replies— ‘Why, what a breeze is here, G?d d?mn my eyes! God bless us, Mistress Bacon! who are you? Zounds, ma'am, I say, my passengers shall sp?w.’ THE WOLF AND THE LION. A TALE, Dedicated to Lord Hawkesbury. Kings really are in general not so bad; And therefore I must take their part; But 'tis their servants that are drunk or mad, With ev'ry demon trick and little art. Champions for master's fame, they fire away; And, 'midst the bustle of the idle fray, Like lubbers, knock him on the head; Then, staring, wonder how he should be dead! Sometimes a king discovers he has eyes— Then for himself he sees—now that is wise. Once on a time a lion, not a fool, Though in the under class of Wisdom's school, Amidst his subjects had a monkey got, Who, rather impudent enough, Would take his sov'reign's foibles off, Tell stories of him—mimic him—what not? This for the scheming wolf was quite a feast, Who told the monarch of the monkey's sinning. Relating all his mimicry and grinning, Trying to irritate the noble beast. ‘What, what, what doth he say?’ the lion cry'd— ‘Dread sir, you are most wickedly belied,’ Rejoin'd the wolf with brazen face— ‘He says that you to merit are no friend. And only to a patronage pretend; And slight th' inferiors of the brutal race. ‘He swears you don't encourage useful beasts; That for yourself alone you're making feasts; And that it is beyond a question, No beast has such a wonderful digestion? That, all so saving, you would skin a stone, And only think of number one; And that it is a sin indeed and shame My Lady Lioness should do the same; That sycophants, who flatter, fawn, and creep, Are really all the company you keep; That beasts of talents, whom you should support, Are all forbid to shew their nose at court.’ ‘What?’ quoth the monarch—‘what, what? doth he so?’— ‘Yes,’ Sire; ‘now hang him, and the rogue requite.’ ‘Wolf,’ quoth the lion, ‘no, no, no, no, no— I fear I fear, the rogue is in the right.’ Now this was noble—like a king in sooth— Who scorn'd to choke a subject for the truth. THE WOLVES, THE BEAR, AND OTHER BEASTS. A FABLE. All judges should be mild and just: This is the case with English ones, I trust: Such K???, B???, shine—those rare law-sages; Neither of these a rash or hot-brain'd fool— Most charming dove-like imps of Mercy's school, Whose names shall live to distant ages— All meekness, sweetness, tender nature— And all their virtues of a giant stature! What happiness it needs must yield a land, To see such goodly men upon the bench, Whom none can with a single murder brand; Whose hearts, so pure, did ne'er emit a stench Like carrion, so offensive to our noses, But scents of lilies, violets, and roses!!! They never, with the faces of the Furies, Dar'd dictate, brow-beat, and control the juries; Nor wilful misinterpreted the law: Full well they know that juries are above 'em! And 'tis astonishing how much they love 'em! When judge and jury thus together draw. With so much pleasure, like a pair of nags, Behold! no tongue opprobious wags! No tongue cries ‘Jeffries bloody Jeffries, Scrogs! Hang, hang those traitors, like a brace of dogs! ‘Not in their beds be they allow'd to die— Nor let their putrid carcasses have graves: Slap Pity's face, if e'er she bids her eye Hold but a drop for such a pair of knaves.’ Full of rich character shall such descend, And honour'd with their high-fam'd fathers sleep: Fair Justice shall with sighs their hearse attend, And Pity's song of melancholy weep. Like leaves, whilst others fall unmourn'd away, And load of death the solitary glooms, Lo! Glory from her sun shall pluck a ray, And bid it spread eternal round their tombs. Yet nations have been curs'd with wicked judges, Who, fond of pow'r, possess'd hard jury-grudges; Who calmly sent poor culprits to their graves, Just as an eastern despot sends his slaves. For such I pen a neat Æsopian tale; Hoping the pretty moral will prevail. Th' inferior beasts most bitterly complain'd, (And who will not complain, whose cheek is smitten?) That from the wolves much hardship they sustain'd, And often most inhumanly were bitten. This wantonness Dame Justice did cry, ‘fie’ on— And mention'd it, but vainly, to the lion. ‘Those damn'd furr'd rascals!’ growl'd the angry beasts, ‘Each wolf upon our meat continual feasts; Yet snap's the word, and quick off goes a head: We must take out their teeth—it can't be borne— Yes, from their jaws their grinders must be torn— Behold, the very fields with blood are red.’ But first the bear must be consulted.—Bruin, Who did not much approve jaw-ruin, With his black hide, to all the beasts appear'd, And with much gravity their story heard. ‘Sirs’ (quoth the bear), ‘you talk of taking teeth, With such an easy and familiar breath, As though it might be pleasant to their jaws; But I must ask the wolves if they'll consent That from their mouths their grinders shall be rent; For this is necessary, sirs, because The wolves are owners of the teeth, and therefore, Before Ruspini's The chevalier, a famous dentist. call'd, will ask a wherefore. Bruin, in consequence, the wolves addrest: ‘Lord wolves, it is the wish of many a beast, That you consent your teeth may all be pull'd;— D?mn me if I would lose my snags, my lords; I'd tell the knaves so, in so many words— God d?mn me, of one's grinders to be gull'd!’ ‘What! lose our teeth?’ exclaim'd the wolves— ‘no, no— We'll keep them, if it only be for show.— Say, my lord bruin, that, and let them chew it— Nay, tell the fools, we wish them somewhat longer, Sharper, and more of them, and stronger; And, if we lose them, force shall only do it.’ This answer of the wolves, lord bear reported: Which answer did not please the beasts at all; Who slighted, now no longer pray'd and courted, But on the villains fast began to fall, Chok'd two or three prime rogues, and, on condition, Receiv'd from all th' affrighted rest, submission. THE TEARS OF ST. MARGARET; ALSO ODES OF CONDOLENCE TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY MUSICAL DIRECTORS, ON THEIR DOWNFALL: To which is added, THE ADDRESS TO THE OWL. LIKEWISE MRS. ROBINSON's HANDKERCHIEF, AND JUDGE BULLER's WIG; A FABLE. ALSO THE CHURCHWARDEN OF KNIGHTSBRIDGE, Or the Feast on a Child. Delirant, Reges, plectuntur Achivi. The king was wroth; and smelling matters out, He put the Grand Directors to the rout. TO THE READER. The frequent complaint of ignorance, partiality, profusion, &amp;c. exhibited against the Most Noble Musical Directors, together with their quarrels with the principal singers and performers, having brought them into unpopularity; and what seemed worst of all, the Most Noble Directors having imprudently made a public declaration, without his majesty's consent, that there was an end of Abbey Commemoration, such a favourite hobby-horse of majesty; the king resolved on their dismission from all and every interference at the oratorio to be performed at St. Margaret's church. The immediate consequence of the royal denunciation was the displeasure of the directors, and was also, of consequence, the displeasure of the Lyric Bard, who sighed on the mournful occasion, and took up the cudgels in their defence. Great has been the cry against them, that they feasted at the Saint Alban's Tavern, at the expense of the Musical Fund. Although I do not credit such rumour, I have taken the fact for granted, that (like their deputies, who actually did feast at different times at the Saint Alban's Tavern, at the expense of the fund) the Noble Directors did condescendingly show the example; and I have hinted that those Most Noble Directors had as fair a right to be rewarded with dinners as parish officers and their friends, who so frequently have a jovial meeting, to eat and tipple eleemosinary on the birth of a bastard. PROLOGUE TO THE ODES; OR, THE TEARS OF ST. MARGARET Now Night, the negro, reign'd—‘Past one o'clock,’ The drowsy watchman bawl'd—from murky vaults, The dough-fac'd spectres crowded forth—the eye, The sunk, the wearied eye of Toil, was clos'd: Mute, Nature's busied voice, her brawl and hum; While Horror, creeping on the world of gloom, Breath'd her dark spirit through the death-like hour— Now from her silver-fringed east the moon Peep'd on the vast of shade—up-mounting slow, In solemn stillness, till her lab'ring orb, Freed from the caves of darkness, gain'd its sphere, And mov'd in splendid solitude along. At this blank hour of awe, amid her fane, That caught a partial radiance on its walls A radiance stealing on the shadowy tombs, Illuminating death,—the pious maid, Whose flesh did wonders in its days of bloom, And bones work'd marvels when she smil'd no ore, The pensive Margaretta stalk'd, and paus'd, And paus'd and stalk'd, and stalk'd and paus'd agen; Now nailing to the twilight floor her eye; Now gazing on the holy windows dim; Now motionless, and now with hurrying step Along the hollow-sounding aisle she pass'd; And leaning lorn at murder'd Raleigh's tomb, Of Silence wak'd the pale and sacred sleep, With plaintive accent, thus ? MARGARET's LAMENTATION. WHY should yon old Abbey, should'ring My poor fane with Gothic pride, Cracking, sinking, falling, mould'ring, On the back of Marg'ret ride? What is that huge ruin's merit? Only fit for housing rats. Be her guests, with all my spirit, Hooting owls, and horrid bats! Why am I to be despis'd, Why am I to be kept under; I who once by kings was priz'd? What's the meaning on't, I wonder? I whose pow'r could agues charm, Fits and tooth-aches, cramps and evils; Satan's wicked self disarm; Him, the great proud prince of devils. Lo, that abbey for past years, At each grand commemoration, For Directors boasted peers— Peers the glory of the nation! Who were my directors? Lo, Doctor Parsons, Justice Collic; Arnold and Dupuis and Co. What a very pretty frolic! But 'tis said the king commanded, And the grand Directors fell: By the king were they disbanded? Fame will blush the tale to tell. Soon I'll go (for what should hinder?) To the first of rhiming men; To that giant Peter Pindar— He shall hear—and then, and then!! Peter in his wrath shall rise, And the scythe of verse prepare; Lo, I see his lightning eyes! Lo, his arm of vengeance bare! Backs of monarchs shall he slice, As he scorns them so sincerely— Woman need not ask him twice; Peter loves the ladies dearly. Thus spoke the saint!—When Morn her blushes spread, To Covent-garden's square she wing'd her flight, And drew the curtains of the poet's bed, Who fortunately slept alone that night. To him she told her story o'er and o'er; When Peter, rous'd by Marg'ret's sad narration, Pull'd off his night-cap, and devoutly swore He'd roast a certain ruler of a nation. Saint Marg'ret thank'd the bard with sweetest smiles, And Peter thunder'd on the King of Isles. ODES OF CONDOLENCE. ODE I. The Poet breaks mournfully out on the fall of the Noble Directors—Threatens to expostulate with the King—Laments the Loss of Direction-importance, Boxes, White Wands, and Dinners at the Saint Alban's Tavern, &amp;c. Poor Leeds! poor Uxbridge! and poor Joah Bates! And all ye other poor ones, of hard fates! 'Tis a strange man this king of ours indeed— There's reason, to be sure, in roasting eggs! What? raise an oratorio at Saint Peg's, And set a thing on foot without a head! What? could the king have music in a church, And leave the great directors in the lurch? Ev'n so!—but lo, I'll parley with the king, And such a peal into his ears I'll ring! Thus will I say, howe'er it may disgust— ‘An't please your majesty, you are unjust.’ ‘How, how?’ the king will cry, with wild rapidity, ‘Yes, sire, the grand directors take it ill; Deeming themselves all men of tuneful skill, And having all for crotchets, hawk-avidity; ‘That they should lose the lead in this affair, Which really makes them marvel, and so stare, Not knowing what offence they have committed; Being a set of very clever men, So stuff'd with crotchet-knowledges, and then For oratorios so nicely fitted! ‘Behold no boxes for directors! no! Who at the abbey form'd a raree-show, With nice kid gloves, medallions, wands so white! Tagrag and bobtail now condemn'd to join; What's ten times worse, condemned to pull out coin; Men so unus'd to pay a single doit! ‘When proud to view of royalty the rays, Your subjects had their bellies full of gaze, Amid the Abbey's glory for past years; Then would they ponder on the white-stick row, Of Uxbridge, Grey de Wilton, Leeds, and Co. And, next to majesty, admire the peers. ‘Who's that slim, whey-fac'd gentleman, and thin, With some old gentlewoman's nose and chin? And he so surly, with a sable face?’ Would gaping strangers all so curious cry; When, all so solemn, I have made reply, That lord is Leeds's very noble grace. ‘With lath-like form, whey face, and cheeks so thin, And good old gentlewoman's nose and chin— And he who lours as though he meant to bite, Is earl of Uxbridge, with his face of night.’ And then I've told the names of all the rest; At which the strangers have been all so blest, Bow'd, curtsy'd low, so grateful—I don't doubt it, They told their dear relations all about it! ‘No more directors challenge admiration! No more the tuneful rulers of a nation! Unknown in vulgar seats they bite their thumbs; Now half awake they nod, and now they sleep, And now they sigh, and now in dreams they weep, And mumble much displeasure midst their gums. ‘Heav'ns? with what huge delight their eyes would hail The breeches Poor Saint Stephen had a very warm pair of breeches clapped to his ???? lately; but the saint luckily shook them off. blazing at Saint Marg'ret's tail, Instead of Stephen, who, to all belief, Poor fellow, must have travell'd with a brief! To solicit charity, like many others who suffer by fire. ‘But, sir, this is not all—for in your ear, Something more horrible brings up the rear! No longer on the tweedle-dum account, At yon fair tavern in Saint Alban's street, Those men of taste and music joyful greet, And load their stomachs to a large amount; ‘All for the good of the poor fund, so kind! Now this is dreadful to my simple mind; To think those titled men, whose valiant jaws, And stomachs all so keen, and deep as sacks, And teeth so valorous in feast attacks, So bravely battled in the tuneful cause, Should, by the royal word so hard commanded, Disgracefully be turn'd adrift—disbanded! ‘I hear, I hear the angry lords exclaim, ‘Thus to be all discarded! 'tis a shame— ‘The royal mandate will be cruel styl'd— Behold churchwardens, overseers so sleek! Read their card-invitations ev'ry week— ‘Sir you're desir'd to come and eat a child.’ One child a week they constantly devour— Sometimes they eat two children—sometimes four— If thus those fellows live, the lazy drones, Lords of a charity may pick the bones; Yes, as provisions are so very dear, Eat a few fiddlers once or twice a year.” ‘Such is the language lords employ, O king, Enough the hearts of savages to wring, And make, I hope, your royal conscience ache— Such reas'nings are indeed extremely deep! Why should of lords the teeth and stomachs sleep, Whilst those of keen churchwardens are awake? Thus to the king of nations will I cry— But what will be his majesty's reply?— ‘Thank, thank ye, Peter, for supporting straws— Good advocate—good, good, in a bad cause: I'll have no more such doings, let me tell ye— No, no, no eating calves in the cow's belly.’ ODE TO ST. CECILIA. The Poet very loyally calls upon St. Cecila, the great Patroness of Music, by way of Justice of Peace, Constable, and Comforter, to come down from Heaven to the noble Directors, issue a Proclamation for dissolving Societies of Musical Instruments; taking them up, and knocking them to Pieces, as also the Heads of the Musicians against each other.—The Poet concludes with a Prophecy of returning Power to the Directors. Divine Cecilia, pray, from Heav'n step down; Most wondrous are the doings in this town! Behold, behold a tuneful revolution! Directors banished, but no execution! Thank God, no grinning heads of lords, poor souls, Amid the mob survey the streets on poles. The fiddles screech with rapture one and all; The flutes and hautboys whistle at the fall: The pompous organ for rebellion ripe! Glad of the long-wish'd overthrow, he opes, To show the world his pleasure, all his stops, And pours his thunders through each giant pipe! Whilst all his pigmies, trilling, squeaking, squalling, Like mad things, every one his tune, are bawling, The hoarse bassoons their nasal twang employ— And hog-like bases grunt the song of joy. Wild screams the trumpet's brazen notes so clear; And on th' occasion, scorning to be mum, Like cannon soundeth on the loaded ear, At solemn intervals, the double drum. The various instruments of wind and string, Thus to the world in saucy triumph sing— ‘What are those Lord-directors?—arrant fools, Mean mongrels—never bred in Music's schools— With just as much of science as a pig; Who scarcely know a psalm-tune from a jig. Are these the men to lead us?—Music swears, And to the pill'ry recommends their ears.’ And lo, of Music the choice bands, Delighted, clap their madding hands; And, raising to the stars their eyes devout, ‘Thank Heav'n,’ they roar, ‘those fellows are turn'd out. No longer shall their tyranny impose, And lead the king of nations by the nose.’ Then, sweet Cecilia, leave thy lofty station; O haste and issue out thy proclamation— Of wond'rous danger let it talk aloud— Root up societies of flutes, bassoons; Knock down the organ, for his rebel tunes, The brazen trumpet break, and crack the crowd. Lay on the necks of the rebellious band Thy powerful and chastising hand— And for their impudent and senseless pother Sweet goddess, knock one head against another. O haste and keep the mournful lords in heart, As scarce a single mortal takes their part. Except the lofty family of pride, Few are the comforters they boast beside— These are their constant friends indeed, and stout; Friends that few nobles ever are without: Hereditary friends of ancient date, Accompanying great title and estate. And yet 'tis said no virtues can reside Where dwells that lofty scowling spirit, pride; That aconite, the noisome weed of gloom, That near it suffers not a flow'r to bloom. Joy to my soul! of Leeds his glorious grace Puts forth a simpering sweet prophetic face, Amid this rough mischance, that seems to say, ‘Though disappointment mocks the present hour, Next year shall mark the triumph of my pow'r, When Faction's scowling fiends shall shun the day.’ Thus when the monarch of the winds, in spite, Rolls a dark phalanx on the golden light, And blots the beauteous orb the world adorning, Sol lifts the sable mantle of a cloud, And peeping underneath the envious shroud, Smiles hope, and says, ‘I'll shine to-morrow morning.’ ODE. [Yet not alone are you by kings despis'd] The bard advises the Directors to submit to their degraded Situation; and by way of Consolation, informs them of the fallen State of the Poets—and, moreover, comforts the Directors with the Changes that take place amongst crowned as well as un-crowned Heads. Yet not alone are you by kings despis'd; Lo, lofty poets are no longer priz'd, That to an eagle turn'd a popinjay; That scorn'd of Time the ever-dreaded wars, Turn'd winking rush-lights into blazing stars, And stole from frail mortality, decay! Poets, with that rare instrument call'd rhime, Drew with the greatest ease the teeth of Time; Snapp'd his broad scythe so keen, and broke his glass; Clipp'd his two wings, and fix'd him on an ass: Such was the envied pow'r of ancient bards, When kings vouchsaf'd to crown them with rewards. In days of old, the bards were sacred creatures, Deem'd so exalted in their natures! By numbers thought fit company for gods! Lo, at the feasts of kings the minstrels sat; Eat, sung, and mingled in the royal chat; And scarcely did there seem a grain of odds. Thus cried those kings of old, (delightful praise!) ‘Touch not the men of other days; Hurt not a hair of those sweet sons of song, Whose voices shall be heard amidst our halls, When we, amidst of death the narrow walls, In gloomy silence shall be stretch'd along.’ Scot-free the poets drank and ate; They paid no taxes to the state! Now comes a butcher, roaring ‘pay your bill;’ Now the blue-apron'd wight of beer, And man of bread, approach and cry, ‘Look here; Not one more morsel, not a single gill, Shall, Master Poet, pass your piping throat, Until you quickly pay up ev'ry groat.’ Unnatural! alas, what Gothic sounds! Thus 'tis the rude profane a poet wounds! At Windsor, when the monarch has been by, How have I languish'd on the royal sty, Where wanton'd fifty little grunting grigs! But never had the king the grace to say, ‘You're hungry, hungry, Peter—take away, Take, take a couple of the prettiest pigs.’ Oft of his geese too have I heard the notes, And, hungry, wish'd to stop their gobbling throats; But vainly did mine eyes around them wander: How easily the monarch might have said, ‘You don't eat roast meat often, I'm afraid; Take, take away the fattest goose or gander.’ Kings care not if we neither drink nor carve— This is their speech in secret, ‘Sing and starve.’ And yet our monarch has a world of books, And daily on their backs so gorgeous looks; So neatly bound, so richly gilt, so fine, He fears to open them to read a line! Since of our books a king can highly deem, The authors surely might command esteem— But here's the dev'l—I fear too many know it— Some kings prefer the binder to the poet. Yet though it never was poor Peter's fate To get a sixpence from the man of state, Who rather tries to keep the poets under— Oft have I dipp'd in golden praise the pen, Writing such handsome things about great men, That Candour's eye-balls have been seen to wonder. Yet had it happen'd that the bard Had borne on high-bred folk a little hard; Good for an evil mortals should return— 'Tis very wicked with revenge to burn. The sun's a bright example, let me say— Obliges the black clouds that veil his ray; Oft makes them decent figures to behold, And covers all their dirty rags with gold. But let us not an idle pother keep, And, ass-like, at a revolution bray; Lo, kings themselves, like cabbages, grow cheap: Thus ev'ry dog at last will have his day— He who this morning smil'd, at night may sorrow; The grub to-day's a butterfly to-morrow. ODE. [Poor imps, we all are born, at times to groan!] The Poet administers Comfort to the disgraced Directors. Poor imps, we all are born, at times to groan! Misfortune won't let Happiness alone; Sharp as a cat for ever pleas'd to watch her, And trying with a thousand traps to catch her. Still must we all submit—it is our fate To mourn at home amid this mortal state! Yet by our folly often worse we make it.— At disappointment frequent have I sigh'd: ‘P-x take the world!’ indignant I have cry'd— Life is not worth the terms on which we take it.’ Then on the lot of mortals did I scowl; And angry thus, one night, address'd an owl. ADDRESS TO AN OWL. ‘Thou solemn bird on yonder ivy'd tow'r, Wilt thou exchange thy nature owl with me? Happy to take possession of thy bow'r, I here protest I would exchange with thee. ‘When to his western bed the sun retires, Obeys the curfew, and puts out his fires; When Evening, blushful harbinger of night, Gems with the dews of health the drooping flow'r; With cooling zephyrs fans the sober hour, And wakes the myriads to the fading light; ‘Forth, with what happiness I pass Amid the moist reviving grass, To meet the tribes by Nature made, To crawl and wing the world of shade! ‘Daughters and sons of night that creep the ground, Blest must ye live, with such a calm around, So unmolested, to enjoy your loves! And lighter people, ye who spread the wing, Now mid the moon's pale lustre sport and sing, Now playful pierce the shadows of the groves. ‘Ye harmless nations, with averted eyes, The sons of men your silent world despise, Because their eyes no punch houses behold; Because no mobs, nor fires, nor thieves appear; Because no riots with their yells they hear; No brothels, scenes of sallow fate unfold. Sweet owl, this short apostrophe excuse; And willing now to thee returns the muse. ‘O bird of wisdom, 'mid the twilight scene Dimly I mark thy philosophic mien— And now I see expand thy snowy wings: To yonder elm, O happy happy fowl, Thou rushest forth to call upon Miss Owl, Expectant of her beau, who darkling sings. ‘Together now ye sail the dusky vale, Now dart on prey, now mount agen the gale; Now on the moon-clad barn or silent grove, Your four hands fill'd with various game, ye go (For hunger must be satisfied I trow); And, after feasting, kiss and sing of love. ‘To-morrow sullen must I move to town, Shook in a wooden engine up and down, For want, O owl, of thy soft gliding wing— Stow'd with a gang of thieves perchance, and trulls; Too noisy for the thickest human skulls— Who smoke, and laugh, and roar, and swill, and sing. ‘Gladly at length I quit my wooden hive; Fatigu'd at busy London I arrive, Parent of sin, and nastiness, and noise: By coach and cart, and wheelbarrow and dray, Through motley mob I force my sighing way; Pimps, porters, chairmen, chimney-sweepers' boys: ‘Saluted, as I pass along, By all the various imps of song, This crying rabbits, rabbits, wild fowl that, Another mack'rel, salmon, oyster, sprat! ‘With such a howling ear-distracting note, And mouth extended as a barn-door wide, That fish and flesh forsooth may be well cried, A man might leap into each cavern throat. ‘In Covent-Garden, at the Hummums, now I sit, but after many a curse and vow Never to see the madding city more; Where barrows truckling o'er the pavements roll, And, what is horror to a tuneful soul, Where asses asses greeting, love-songs roar; ‘Which asses, that the Garden square adorn, Must lark-like be the heralds of my morn. Let others talk with wild affright Of horrors and the shades of night; You want not Sol's refulgent painful ray; Night to your eyes is but a milder day. ‘Let others mock your airs that simply flow— Teeho, teewhit, teewhit, teeho— But then, dear owl, 'tis sweetly simple, mind: Avaunt the scientific squall— I hate it—nature hates it all— But lo! 'tis science and the ton, I find. ‘The ear with harsh chromatics must be teas'd, Grown much too fashionable to be pleas'd. Here could I wander 'mid the dewy glade, On sacred silence feast, and shade: But ah! farewell—rest calls me—'tis night's noon; On wings of freedom as thou sweep'st the sky, Sweet child of shadows, o'er my hamlet fly, And kindly sooth my slumber with a tune.’ Thus out of humour I address'd the bird, Wishing to change conditions with the fowl; But at the cheerful morn, upon my word, I lik'd the man-state better than the owl. Thus anger'd at the wayward tricks of fate, Pettish you wish your grandeur at the devil; Yet, after cursing high and mighty state, You wisely deem it not so huge an evil: Contented to be men of worship still, Pleas'd with the gifts that kings, not Heav'n, bestow; Proud, from the height of title's star-clad hill, To mock us poor unhonour'd grubs below. ODE. ['Tis giv'n as gospel both in prose and rhimes] The Poet comforteth again and again and again the noble Directors with moral Reflections, &amp;c. 'Tis giv'n as gospel both in prose and rhimes, That people should not be for ever blest; Misfortune therefore must be good at times, A salutary, though satiric guest; That goads to Virtue's works the rump of Sloth; Like gout, that bites us into health so fair; Or like the needle, while it wounds the cloth, It puts the rag into repair. Sigh now no more, nor let those suns, your eyes, Be dimly gleaming through perpetual show'rs— Let pleasure bring the beam of summer skies, And gild the pinions of your sable hours. Let not Grief's surge along your bosom roll, Nor Fancy gather sorrows for the soul. Ah! sigh no more, sweet lords, pray sigh no more! Not all, not all your consequence is dead; In Tot'nam-street you still preserve a pow'r, And proudly bear an elevated head; Where, all obedience, and with one accord, Musicians learn to tremble at the Lord Of the night, who selects the music, and sometimes gives a soprano song to a bass voice, and who once ordered, in the Jubilate, the trumpet part to be executed by the German flute.. ODE. [Life changes—now 'tis calm—now hurricane—] The Vicissitudes of Life, wonderful! Life changes—now 'tis calm—now hurricane— Up, down, down, up—a very windmill's vane Is man, poor fellow—much too like a ball; 'Tis high, 'tis low—'tis this way now, now that, Just as its wooden master wills, the bat— Thus majesty can bid us rise or fall. The monarch may repent him of the deed— His heart so soft at your dismission bleed, To House of Buckingham you may be call'd, And at the queen's sweet little concerts sing; Then how the tribes of nobles will be gall'd! This will be soaring on the eagle's wing. Thus to the world then be it understood, What seems misfortune, happens for our good: This from my rhiming store-house, or my stable, May be elucidated by a fable. MRS. ROBINSON's HANDKERCHIEF AND JUDGE BULLER's WIG. A FABLE. A Handkerchief, that long had press'd, The snows of Laura's swelling breast, O'er which fair scene full many a longing lover, With panting heart, and frequent sighs, And pretty modest leering eyes, Had often, often been observ'd to hover— This handkerchief to Kitty giv'n, Was forc'd at length to leave its heav'n, And enter a Jew clothes-man's ample bag— O what a sad reverse, poor soul! To sweat in such a horrid hole, With ev'ry sort of dirty rag! ‘Pray, who are you?’ the plaintive 'kerchief cry'd, Perceiving a rough neighbour at her side: ‘You smell as though your master was a pig— What are you? tell me stinking creature.’—‘Ma'am,’ The hairy neighbour grave replied, ‘I am The most tremendous great Judge Buller's wig.’ ‘Indeed sir! O how chang'd our fate! How diff'rent were we both of late! Now to be lodg'd in this vile place— What will become of us at last? O dear, Something more terrible than this, I fear, Something that carries huge disgrace.’ ‘Madam,’ rejoin'd the wig, ‘don't cry; No cause have you indeed to sigh; So trust for once a wig's prophetic words— My fate is to be just the same, I find; Still for a scarecrow's head design'd, To frighten all the thieves—the birds. ‘But, luckier, you so chang'd will rise, A fav'rite of ten thousand eyes: Not burnt (as you suppos'd perhaps) to tinder; Chang'd to the whitest paper—happy leaves, For him, the bard who like a god conceives, The great, th' immortal Peter Pindar.’ La, sir, then what a piece of news! God bless, I say, God bless the Jews— I wish my dear dear mistress did but know it: Her hands then I shall happy touch again; For madam always did maintain That Mister Pindar was a charming poet.’ ODE. [Once more I pray you, be not sad] Still more Comfort for Directors! Once more I pray you, be not sad; Remember what the proverb doth declare: 'Tis better riding on a pad, Than on a horse's back that's bare, At Tot'nam's concert, to delight ye— Behold, my lords, you still are mighty. Think of your titles too—the name of lord, What merit it proclaims of head and heart! It is a tradesman's handsome board, In letters fair of gold that doth impart To people who their mouths of wonder ope, What goodly articles are in the shop. Yes, as of yore, the pompous name of lord Doth still our awe-clad admiration rule— And comfort to the hungry doth afford— As nods of lords are dinners for a fool. ‘I thank my God, I am not like those fellows,’ Cried the proud Pharisee, the bellows Or trumpet of his reputation blowing— And you in triumph also may exclaim Proud of a peer's exalted name, With pride of title and fair birth o'erflowing. ‘I thank my stars, I am not like the mob, Whom Nature fabricated by the job.’ You shall, you shall return to pow'r, And o'er the grumbling million tow'r; Your sacred laws shall be obey'd— Musicians to allegiance must return— In sackcloth and in ashes mourn; Submitting, if you will it, to be flay'd. Their eyes so fierce, that flash'd like tin reflectors, As though they meant to roast the grand directors, Shall from their meteor fury fade away Becoming mild and placid as the light Shed by the worm, the lamp of dewy night, Or Luna's modest melancholy ray. Yes! to your noble hearts' delight, With waving wands and gloves so white, And gilt medallions blest, shall ye appear; Smile at us mob, the many-headed beast; And, as you seem to like a gratis feast, Eat a few fiddlers ev'ry year. THE CHURCHWARDEN, OR THE FEAST ON A CHILD. A TALE. The following Story, founded on a fact that happened some Years since at the Swan at Knights-bridge, is introduced to illustrate the Meaning of eating a Child, mentioned in the first Ode. At Knightsbridge, at a tavern called the Swan, Churchwardens, overseers, a jolly clan, Order'd a dinner, for themselves and friends— A very handsome dinner of the best: Lo! to a turn, the diff'rent joints were drest— Their lips, wild licking, ev'ry man commends. Loud was the clang of plates, and knives, and forks; Delightful was the sound of claret corks, That stopp'd so close and lovingly the bottle: Thou Savoir-vivre club, and jen' sais quoi, Full well the voice of honest corks ye know, Deep and deep-blushing from the gen'rous pottle. All ear, all eye to listen and to see, The landlord was as busy as a bee— Yes, Larder skipp'd like harlequin so light; In bread, beer, wine, removal swift of dishes, Nimbly anticipating all their wishes— Now this, to man voracious as a kite, Is pleasant—as the trencher-heroes hate All obstacles that keep them from the plate, As much as jockeys on a running horse Curse cows or jack-asses that cross the course. Nay, here's a solid reason too; for mind, Bawling for things, demandeth mouth and wind: Whatever therefore weak'neth wind and jaws, Is hostile to the gormandizing cause. Having well cramm'd, and swill'd, and laugh'd, and sung, And toasted girls, and clapp'd, and roar'd, and rung, And broken bones of tables, chairs, and glasses, Like happy bears, in honour of their lasses, Not wives! not one was toasted all the time— Thus were they decent—it had been a crime, As wives are delicate and sacred names, Not to be mix'd indeed with wh?s and flames: I say, when all were cramm'd unto the chin, And ev'ry one with wine had fill'd his skin, In came the landlord with a cherub smile: Around to ev'ry one he lowly bow'd, Was vastly happy—honour'd—vastly proud— And then he bow'd again in such a style! ‘Hop'd gemmen lik'd the dinner and the wine:’ To whom the gemmen answer'd, ‘very fine! ‘A glorious dinner, Larder, to be sure.’— To which the landlord, laden deep with bliss, Did with his bows so humble almost kiss The floor. Now in an alter'd tone—a tone of gravity, Unto the landlord full of smiles and suavity, Did Mister Guttle the church warden call— ‘Come hither, Larder,’ said soft Mister Guttle, With solemn voice and fox-like face, so subtle— ‘Larder, a little word or two, that's all.’ Forth ran th' obedient landlord with good will, Thinking most nat'rally upon the bill. ‘Landlord,’ (quoth Guttle, in a soft sly sound, Not to be heard by any in the room, Yet which, like claps of thunder, did confound) ‘Do you know any thing of Betty Broom?’ ‘Sir?’ answer'd Larder, stamm'ring—‘Sir! what, sir? Yes, sir, yes—yes—she liv'd with Mistress Larder; But may I never move, nor never stir, If but for impudence we did discard her: No, Mister Guttle—Betty was too brassy— We never keep a sarvant that is saucy.’ ‘But, landlord—Betty says she is with child.’— ‘What's that to me?’ quoth Larder, looking wild— ‘I never kiss'd the hussey in my life, Nor hugg'd her round the waist, nor pinch'd her cheek; Never once put my hand upon her neck— Lord, sir, you know that I have got a wife. ‘Lord! nothing comely to the girl belongs— I would not touch her with a pair of tongs: A little puling chit, as white as paste; I'm sure that never suited with my taste. ‘But then, suppose—I only say, suppose I had been wicked with the girl—alack, My wife hath got the cursed'st keenest nose, Why, zounds, she would have catch'd me in a crack; ‘Then quickly in the fire had been the fat— Curse her! she always watch'd me like a cat. ‘Then, as I say, Bet did not hit my taste, It was impossible to be unchaste:— Therefore it never can be true, you see— And Mistress Larder's full enough for me.’ ‘Well,’ answer'd Guttle, ‘Man, I'll tell ye what— Your wind and eloquence you now are wasting: Whether Miss Betty hit your taste or not, There's good round proof enough that you've been tasting. ‘And, Larder, you've a wife, 'tis very true, Perhaps a little somewhat of a shrew; But Betty was not a bad piece of stuff.’— ‘Well, Mister Guttle, may I drop down dead, If ever once I crept to Betty's bed! And that, I'm sure, is swearing strong enough.’ ‘But, Larder, all your swearing will not do, If Betty swears that she's with child by you. Now Betty came and said she'd swear at once— But you know best—yet mind, if Betty'll swear, And then again! should Mistress Larder hear, The Lord have mercy, Larder, on thy sconce ‘Why, man, were this affair of Betty told her, Not all the dev'ls in hell would hold her. ‘Then there's your modest stiff-rump'd neighbours all; There'd be a pretty kick-up—what a squall! You could not put your nose into a shop— There's lofty Mistress Wick, the chandler's wife, And Mistress Bull, the butcher's imp of strife, With Mistress Bobbin, Salmon, Muff, and Slop, With fifty others of such old compeers— Zounds, what a hornet's nest about thy ears!’ From cheerful smiles, and looks, like Sol so bright, Poor Larder fell to looks as black as night; And now his head he scratch'd, importing guilt— For people who are innocent indeed, Never look down, so black, and scratch the head; But, tipp'd with confidence, their noses tilt, Replying with an unembarrass'd front: Bold to the charge, and fix'd to stand the brunt.— Truth is a tow'ring dame—divine her air; In native bloom she walks the world with state: But Falsehood is a meretricious fair, Painted and mean, and shuffling in her gait; Dares not look up with Resolution's mien, But sneaking hides, and hopes not to be seen; For ever haunted by a doubt That all the world will find her out. Again—there's honesty in eyes, That shrinking show when tongues tell lies— With Larder this was verily the case; Informers were the eyes of Larder's face. ‘Well, sir,’ said Larder, whisp'ring, hemming, haing, Each word so heavy, like a cart-horse drawing— ‘This is a d?mn'd affair, I can't but say— Sir, please to accept a note of twenty pound; Contrive another farher may be found; And, sir, here's not a halfpenny to pay.’ Thus ended the affair, by prudent treaty; For who, alas! would wish to make a pother? Guttle next morning went and talk'd to Betty, When Betty swore the bantling to another. By this ingenious mode of parish cookery, the same child may be devoured a dozen times over. A PAIR OF LYRIC EPISTLES TO LORD MACARTNEY AND HIS SHIP. Yes, of our Bagshot wonders tell Kien Long; Delicious subjects for an epic song! Epistle to Lord Macartney. O, if successful, thou wilt be ador'd! Wide as a Cheshire cat our court will grin, To find as many pearls and gems on board As will not leave thee room to stick a pin. Epistle to the Ship. TO THE READER. It has been my wish, that the following pair of Lyric Epistles might be presented, with my Odes, to the Emperor Kien Long, on account of the quantity of original merit—but, to use a sublime phrase, as it would be ‘letting the cat out of the bag,’ I have forborne. The bustle and prowess of the invincible Duke on Bagshot Heath—the Heath on fire—the royal visit— the man of straw blown from the mine—the explosion of the powder mills at Hownslow—the attention of gods, as well as of the crows, to the camp —the humility of the Bagshot bushes, &amp;c. are circumstances which, however they may be disdained by the fastidious pen of history, ought to be recorded. Indeed, I from my soul believe, that our historians, as they are called, are too conceitedly lofty to think of sullying a page with an account of the camp transaction; but poets were the only historians of ancient times, which I am ready to prove by a profusion of learned quotation; and consequently your dull uninspired prose-men are invaders. For my part, I am resolved to support the poetical charter; and, consequently, as often as the Duke, and the King, and the Queen, and Madam Schwellenberg, and Lord Cardigan, and old Nicolai the fiddler, and Sir Francis Drake, and the pages, the cooks, and the stable-boys, &amp;c. shall utter good things, achieve great actions, and be seen in close and important conversation together, such events shall be honoured with niches in my Lyric Temple of Immortality. The Epistle to the Ship seems so be full of poetry and good wishes; but the horrid picture of the future disappointment of our Ambassador and his Suite at Pekin, with the disgracefully attendant circumstances, we hope to be merely a playful sketch of fancy of the Muse, and that she has really been visited by no such flogging illuminations. A LYRIC EPISTLE TO LORD MACARTNEY, AMBASSADOR TO THE COURT OF CHINA. O crown'd with glory by our glorious king, Deck'd in his liv'ry too, a glorious thing, Amid the wonders at Saint James's done; At house of Buckingham, in Richmond bow'rs, At Kew, and lastly Windsor's lofty tow'rs, Rich scenes at once of majesty and fun; Forget not thou the camp on Bagshot Heath, Where met the grimly regiments of death; Where not the dev'l their rage sublime could damp; Though heav'n, as if it meant to mock the matter, Pour'd on their powder'd heads huge tubs of water, And made the mighty Heath a dirty swamp. Yes, of our Bagshot wonders tell Kien Long— Delicious subjects for the epic song. Talk of the valiant troops, all heav'n-descended, On which the Kings of Britain oft depended, When bold Rebellion through the nation ran; Her venom spread, and told a vulgar host, To humble, sweet Subordination lost, That lo! the mightiest monarch was but man! Such soldiers! such rare gen'rals! no poltroons, Swell'd by the gas of courage to balloons; Where, though those men like bacon all were smok'd, Not one, by God's good providence, was chok'd. Of Richmond's mighty chieftain, Richmond speak— ‘Now wet, a riding dish-clout,’ shalt thou say— ‘Now broiling, whizzing, dropping like a steak, So val'rous, 'mid the sun's meridian ray!’ Talk to Kien Long about his grace's soul; What wisdom, sweetness, love, pervades the whole! But souls in common are a dreary waste, By brambles, thistles, barb'rous docks disgrac'd; That need the ploughshare, harrow, and the fire— Some souls are caves of filth and spectred gloom, That want a window and a broom, To yield them light, and clear the mire. When honours lift th' unworthy fool on high, On Fortune how with fierce contempt I scowl! She hangs a dirty cloud upon the sky, And with an eagle's pinion imps an owl. Yet knaves and fools enjoy their lucky hours, And ribbons, 'stead of ropes, their backs adorn— Thus crawls the toad amid the fairest flow'rs, And with the lily drinks the dews of morn. But royal Richmond honours exaltation— The pole-star of our military nation. How pleasant then to see a Richmond rise! Friend of a king, and fav'rite of the skies! Charles King of England, whose mistress was a French woman, the great, great, and illustrious ancestor of his present grace., to support a bastard and a wh?, Impos'd a tax on coals, that starv'd the poor: Those sans-culottes-men made the saddest din! But mark, how often good proceeds from evil! This deed of Charles is now a white-wash'd devil— Lo, Richmond casts a lustre round the sin! By means of this once shameful tax on coal, He sniggles modest Merit from her hole; Where is the soldier that is not his friend? See Admiration to his virtues bend; And lo, the star-clad veteran adores! While Glory humbly kneeling to the skies, With supplicating hands and fervent eyes, A length of days upon his head implores. Say, that his grace, ambitious of a name, Is ever angling to catch martial fame: And say too, how most fortunate the duke, What noble fishes hang upon his hook; Whilst humbler mortals, lab'ring day and night, Poor patient creatures, seldom feel a bite. Pow'r in the hands of Virtue is heav'n's dew, That fost'ring feeds the flow'r of happiest hue— In Vice's grasp, it withers, wounds, and kills: 'Tis then the fang so fatal, form'd to make, A passage for the venom of the snake, That Nature's life with dissolution fills. Bow down, ye armies, then, and thank your God, That Richmond holds the military rod: No Janus he, with selfish views to fob, And touch the nation's pocket with a job. Witness the convenient house and gardens near Plymouth Dock, so œconomically built with the public money. The annals of honour furnish us not with a sublimer instance of self-denial. Yes, let the emp'ror all about him hear, Talk of the bold transactions of the peer; And say, what probably he can't believe, That lo, the dauntless body of his grace, In duels bor'd, has scarcely one sound place— A honeycomb, a cullender, a sieve! Say how that nothing could his courage check; Proud of his post, and fearless of his neck, Though only one upon his shoulders dear— Thus Valour smiles at danger, death, and pain, And feels an eighteen-pounder through his brain, Coolly as some a pat upon the ear! Say, how he gallop'd wild, up hill, down dale; Frighten'd each village, turn'd each hovel pale; Struck all the birds with terror, save the crows, Who, spying such commotion in the land, Concluded some great matter was in hand, Much blood and carnage 'midst contending foes. Say, how the world his deeds with wonder saw; Say, that the Bagshot bushes bow'd with awe; And say, his phiz such valour did inspire, That lo, the very ground he trod, caught fire. This is a literal fact. Say, how went forth to see him, half the nation, Their mouths well cramm'd with dust and admiration, So ardent ev'ry eye's devouring look To seize the galloping, the flying duke. Such eating and such guzzling ev'ry day! Nothing to pay! All the duke's friends, great quality and small; Our great King George, and lovely queen, Were entertain'd scot-free, I ween— Our generous nation doom'd to pay it all. And yet, when Parliament beholds the bill, I think that Parliament, with much ill will, May growl, and swear it was an idle thing, This game of soldiers, such a childish play— But let me answer Parliament, and say, It was not childish, for it pleas'd the king— It made Tom Paine, the bull-dog, hold his tongue; Arm'd with such lion-paws, and teeth so long; Say, that the sun-like duke shone forth so bright, That Punch ne'er triumph'd in a fiercer fight. Say, how he fir'd the Hounslow mills of powder; Say, how the sympathizing grain, with sound, Frighten'd the tiles from all the roofs around, Defying the bold thunder to roar louder! Say, that immortal Cæsar Julius Cæsar was most certainly at Bagshot. trod the place Now fiercely gallop'd over by his grace. Say, that the gods beheld him from on high— That, to the lord of battles Mars., with a sigh, Thus spoke the monarch of the clouds—‘Son Mars, Had Troy possess'd a hero like the duke, With such a soul, and such a fighting look, Our city had been safe amidst her wars. ‘Go quickly, pull thy hat off to the duke, And beg a lesson from the hero's book.’ Lord! as the duke, where powder only flam'd, Was so inspir'd, so val'rous, and so hot; How had this duke the sons of battle sham'd, 'Mid scenes of thunder, where they charg'd with shot! Say too (and verily it was no joke), Although so lofty on their cloud-capp'd tow'rs, Such were the volumes of ascending smoke, Smutty as blacksmiths look'd the heav'nly pow'rs; And that the man of straw It is reported, that a colossal figure, stuffed with straw, was blown out of the hill, to give their majesties an adequate idea of the ascent of ten thousand men or so, a frequent event at grand sieges. It is moreover reported, that this stuffed figure obtained a large portion of royal approbation. Indeed I am strongly inclined to believe the story.—It was quite a new idea. (a thought how bright!) Flew up, and put their godships in a fright! Tell him, which probably may cause a smile, That, at the distance of a mile, His grace, a skull that powder wants, can note; (Which, when it happens, let that skull beware) See too a club with one disorder'd hair, And mark one spot of grease upon a coat. Thus war was Gothic, slovenly, unchaste, Till Richmond usher'd in the morn of taste! Say too, that for the honour of the nation, We hope to see a book on reputation, Proving that public vice should bring no shame The reader is desired to ask Lord Lauderdale concerning this matter.; That private only damns a noble name. Thus the poor nymph, too easy to contend, Who blushing sins in secret with a friend, Shall be a viler hussey than the woman Who hangs her lips like cherries out for sale, And shows her bosom's lilies, to regale Each grazing beast that offers—quite a common. ‘Why should I say all this unto the king?’ Thou cryest, O Macartney.—Good may spring: It may unto thy embassy give weight, By putting great Kien Long into a fright. ‘Who knows,’ Kien Long may whine with rueful face, ‘But all the rank and file are like his grace— Then shall I shake upon my sapphire throne: For troops like Richmond, that on valour feast, May, like wild meteors, pour into mine east, And leave my palace neither stick nor stone; ‘Like roaring lions rush to eat me up— In Britain breakfast, and in China sup.’ TO THE SHIP. O thou, so nicely painted, and so trim, Success attend our court's delightful whim; And all thy gaudy gentlemen on board; With coaches just like gingerbread, so fine, Amid the Asiatic world to shine, And greet of China the imperial lord. Methinks I view thee tow'ring at Canton: I hear each wide-mouth'd salutation-gun; I see thy streamers wanton in the gale; I see the sallow natives crowd the shore, I see them tremble at thy royal roar; I see the very Mandarines turn pale. Pagodas of Nang-yang, and Chou-chin-chou, So lofty, to our trav'ling Britons bow; Bow, mountains sky-enwrapp'd of Chin-chung-chan; Floods of Ming-ho, your thund'ring voices raise; Cuckoos of Ming-fou-you, exalt their praise, With geese of Sou-chen-che, and Tang-ting-tan. O monkeys of Tou-fou, pray line the road, Hang by your tails, and all the branches load; Then grin applause upon the gaudy throng, And drop them honours as they pass along. Frogs of Fou-si, O croak from pools of green; Winnow, ye butterflies, around the scene; Sing O be joyful, ev'ry village pig; Goats, sheep, and oxen, through your pastures prance; Ye buffaloes and dromedaries, dance; And elephants, pray join th' unwieldy jig. I mark, I mark, along the dusty road, The glitt'ring coaches with their happy load, All proudly rolling to Pe-kin's fair town; And lo, arriv'd, I see the emp'ror stare, Deep marv'ling at a sight so very rare; And now, ye gods! I see the emp'ror frown. And now I hear the lofty emp'ror say, ‘Good folks, what is it that you want, I pray?’ And now I hear aloud Macartney cry, ‘Emp'ror, my court, inform'd that you were rich, Sublimely feeling a strong money-itch, Across the eastern ocean bade me fly; ‘With tin, and blankets, O great king, to barter, And gimcracks rare for China-man and Tartar. ‘But presents, presents are the things we mean: Some pretty diamonds to our gracious queen, Big as one's fist or so, or somewhat bigger, Would cut upon her petticoat a figure— A petticoat of whom each poet sings, That beams on birth-days for the best of kings. ‘Yes, presents are the things we chiefly wish— These give not half the toil we find in trade.’— On which th' astonish'd emp'ror cries, ‘Odsfish! Presents;—present the rogues the bastinade.’ Stern Resolution's eye, that flash'd with fate, At danger cow'ring, wears a wither'd look; Palsy'd his sinewy arm, where vengeance sate, Whose grasp the rugged oak of ages shook— His blood, so hot, grown suddenly so chill; Sunk from a torrent to the creeping rill. In short, behold with dread Macartney stare; Behold him seiz'd, his seat of honour bare; The bamboo sounds—alas! no voice of Fame: Stripp'd, schoolboy-like, and now I see his train, I see their lily bottoms writhe with pain, And, like his lordship's, blush with blood and shame. Ah! what avails the coat of scarlet dye, And collar blue, around their pretty necks? Ah! what the epaulettes that roast the eye, And loyal buttons blazing with George Rex? Heav'ns! if Kien Long resolves upon their stripping, These are no talismans to ward a whipping. Now with a mock solemnity of face, I see the mighty emp'ror gravely place Fools'-caps on all the poor degraded men— And now I hear the solemn emp'ror say, ‘'Tis thus we kings of China folly pay; Now, children, ye may all go home agen.’ O beauteous vessel, should this prove the case, How in Old England wilt thou show thy face? I fear thy visage will be wondrous long. Know, it may happen—ministers and kings, Like common folk, are fallible—poor things! Too often sanguine, and as often wrong. Yet, if successful, thou wilt be ador'd— Lo, like a Cheshire cat our court will grin! How glad to find as many gems on board, As will not leave thee room to stick a pin! ODES TO KIEN LONG, The present Emperor of China; WITH THE QUAKERS, A TALE; TO A FLY, Drowned in a Bowl of Punch; ODE TO MACMANUS, TOWNSEND, AND JEALOUS, The Thief-Takers; TO CÆLIA.—TO A PRETTY MILLINER. TO THE FLEAS OF TENERIFFE.—TO SIR W. HAMILTON.—TO MY CANDLE, &amp;c. ??? ???????? ??????? &amp;c. Anacreon. ‘Yes, let us strike the lyre, and sing, and rhime; By far the wisest way of spending time.’ So says Anacreon, my dear Kien Long; Let Britain then, and China, hear our song. TO THE EMPEROR OF CHINA. DEAR KIEN LONG, At length an opportunity presents itself for conversing with the second potentate upon earth, George the Third being most undoubtedly the first, although he never made verses. Thy praises of Moukden, thy beautiful little Ode to Tea, &amp;c. have afforded me infinite delight; and to gain my plaudit, who am rather difficult to please, will, I assure thee, be a feather in thy imperial cap. Principibus placuisse viris, non ultima laus est. Praise from a bard of my poetic spirit, Proclaims indeed no small degree of merit. Excuse this piece of egotism—it is natural, and justified by the sublimest authorities. What says Virgil? ‘Tentanda via est quâ me quoque possim, Tollere humo, victorque virûm volitare per ora. What, likewise, Lucretius? ‘Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam Unde prius nulli velarunt tempora musæ.’ What, also, Ovid? ‘Jamque opus exegi,’ &amp;c. What, moreover, Horace? ‘Exegi monumentum ære perennius,’ &amp;c. What, Ennius? ‘Nemo me lacrumeis decoret nec funera fletu,’ &amp;c. What, again, the great father of poetry, Homer, in his delightful Hymn, that some impudent scholiasts declare he never wrote? ???? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ??? ??? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??????????? ??? ????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????. Which, with a few preceding lines omitted in the quotation, I thus a little paraphrastically and beautifully translate: Should Curiosity at times inquire Who strikes with sweetest art the muse's lyre? This be thine answer—‘A poor man, stark blind; An aged minstrel that at Chios dwells, Who sells and sings his works, and sings and sells, And leaves all other poets far behind.’ So much for my profound learning in defence of egotism; for where is the man that does not rank himself amongst his own admirers? Now to the point.—As Lord Macartney, with his most splendid retinue, is about to open a trade with thee, in the various articles of tin, blankets, woollen in general, &amp;c. in favour of the two kingdoms; why might not a literary commerce take place between the great Kien Long, and the no less celebrated Peter Pindar? Thou art a man of rhimes—and so am I. Thou art a genius of uncommon versatility—so am I. Thou art an enthusiast to the Muses—so am I. Thou art a lover of novelty—so am I. Thou art an idolator of royalty—so am I. With such a congeniality of mind, in my god's name, and thine, let us surprise the world with an interchange of our lucubrations, both for its improvement and delight. And to show thee that I am not a literary swindler, unable to repay thee for goods I may receive from thy imperial majesty, I now transmit specimens of my talents, in ode, ballad, elegy, fable, and epigram. I am, dear Kien Long, Thy humble servant, and brother poet, P. PINDAR. ODES TO KIEN LONG. ODE I. Peter complimenteth Kien Long on his poetical Talent, and condemneth the Want of literary Taste in western Kings. Dear Emp'ror, prince of poets, noble bard, Thy brother Peter sendeth thee a card, To say thou art an honour to the times— Yes, Peter telleth thee, that for a king, Indeed a most extraordinary thing, Thou really makest very charming rhimes. Witness thy Moukden A favourite city of the emperor., which we all admire; Witness thy pretty little Ode to Tea, Compos'd when sipping by thy Tartar fire; Witness thy many a madrigal and glee. Believe me, venerable, good Kien Long, Vast is my pleasure that the Muse's song Divinely soundeth through thy Tartar groves; Still greater, that the first of eastern kings Should praise in rhime the Tartar vales and springs, And pay a tuneful tribute to the Loves. Yet how it hurts my classic soul, to find Some western kings to poetry unkind! What though they want the skill to make a riddle, Charade, or rebus, or conundrum;—still Those kings might show towards them some good will, And nobly patronize Apollo's fiddle. But no—the note is, ‘How go sheep a score? What, what's the price of bullock? how sells lamb? I want a boar, a boar, I want a boar; I want a bull, a bull, I want a ram.’ Whereas it should be this—‘I want a bard, To cover him with honour and reward.’ Kings deem, ah me! a grunting herd of swine Companions sweeter than the tuneful Nine; Preferring to Fame's dome, a hog-sty's mire; The roar of oxen to Apollo's lyre. ‘Lord! is it possible?’ I hear thee groan— Kien Long, 'tis true as thou art on thy throne: For souls like thine, 'tis natural to doubt it— Macartney can inform thee all about it. ODE II. More Compliments to the Emperor—A Dissertation on Thrones, and Kings and Queens—A very proper Attack on the French Revolutionists —The Fate of poor Religion prophesied— Also, of his Holiness the Pope—More Lamentations on degraded Royalty. Thou art a second Atlas, great Kien Long; Supporting half th' unwieldy globe, so strong; But, Lord! what pigmy souls to empire rise! Unconscious of its glorious frame, they sleep— Now just like mice from pyramids that peep, Thinking a hole's a hole, where'er it lies. Fortune has too much pow'r in this same world— Things are too often topsy-turvy hurl'd! A bug condemn'd to fly that scarce can crawl; A maggot taken from his little nut, (There by the great All-wise most wisely put) To grovel 'midst the grandeur of St. Paul! Unluckily most thrones are placed so high, That kings can scarce their loving subjects spy, Hopping beneath them, like so many crows; Which subjects have in France been taking Great liberties in ladder-making, To get up nearer to the royal nose. Thus wrens ere long their pigmy pow'rs will try And, turning to the clouds their little eye, Aim to arrest, by frequent daring flights, Their elder brothers of the skies, the kites! And yet I hate a fool upon a throne— We have been happy hitherto, thank God; How boys would burst with laughter, ev'ry one, Were monkey-schoolmasters to hold the rod! Yet much more mischief follows royal fools, As realms are on a larger scale than schools— Th' Americans provide against all this: Which certain gentlefolk take much amiss! And then again, the wives of glorious kings, In generosity, and such-like things, And temper mild, who well themselves demean, Are for the subject a rare happy matter; And let me say indeed, who scorn to flatter, We Britons are most lucky in a queen. Of humbling their superiors, folks seem fond, And treating monarchs as so many logs; Whereas it is in courts, as in a pond, Some fish, some frogs. Thus do the rebel foes of sovereigns cry, Rending with wild disloyalty the sky. ‘When will the lucky day be born that brings A bridle for the insolence of kings? Too slowly moves, alas! the loitering hour! When will those tyrants cease to fancy man A fawning dog in Providence's plan, Ordain'd to lick the blood-stain'd rod of Pow'r?’ Kings have their faults undoubtedly, and many— The man who contradicts me, is a zany. Some rob, some kill, some cheat, some cringe and beg; Curst with an av'rice, some would shave an egg. And yet, with all their sins, I drop a tear On what I'm daily forc'd to see and hear. Great is the change of late! such horrid scenes, Such little rev'rence both for kings and queens! Thus cry the Frenchmen, seldom over-nice— ‘We want no scepter'd plunderers of states; Out with them—folly to maintain more cats Than capable of catching mice. ‘Death to their parasites—we'll have no more Leeches that suck the heart's blood of the poor. Down with dukes, earls, and lords, those Pagan Josses, False gods!—away with stars, and strings, and crosses!’ The French are very wicked, I declare; They raise upon one's head, one's very hair; So much those fellows majesty abuse— Of royalty the purple robe so grand, Which seizes the deep rev'rence of a land, They to a malkin turn, to wipe their shoes. ‘Out with state-pickpockets!’ they cry aloud: ‘Death to the rav'nous eagles,’ cries the crowd, ‘That happy hover o'er a people's groan; Thieves, in the plunder of an empire drest; Flatt'ry's vile carrion flies, on kings that feast; Rank bugs that shelter in the wood of thrones! ‘The dustman in his cart that hourly slaves, Drawn by an ass the partner of his toils, Tow'rs far superior to those titled knaves, In coaches glitt'ring with a kingdom's spoils!’ The old sic volo, that with thund'ring sound, Rous'd all the provinces of France around (And if great things we may compare to small, Just like the boatswain's whistle, that makes skip The jovial fellows of a ship) This great sic volo is not heard at all— To humbler phrases chang'd by some degrees; ‘With your good leave, Messieurs’—‘Sirs, if you please.’ Yes, savage are the French to kings and quality; Void of good manners, common hospitality— Barb'rous, they dog like wish to pick their bones: Make just as much of dukes as of a duck, (Nobility has therefore shocking luck), And dash an infant prince against the stones. Thus butchers calmly stick a sucking pig, And o'er a bleeding lambkin hum a jig. Religion too is in a deep decline, Her vot'ries treated like a herd of swine, Rich reliques look'd upon as rotten lumber! Who will be canoniz'd for fright'ning devils, For bringing back lost limbs, and curing evils, Scald heads, wry necks, and rickets beyond number, Without a draught, a bolus, or a pill, That of redoubted doctors foil the skill? Religion, who in France some years ago, Made in rich silks so wonderful a show, So us'd with all the pride of curls to charm, Is now, poor soul, oblig'd to beg her bread, With scarce a cap or ribbon to her head, Or woollen petticoat to keep her warm. Ah! sinking fast, 'tis thought she may expire; Her whips demolish'd, and extinct her fire, Her pinchers broken, snapp'd in twain her cleaver, That flogg'd, that burnt a sinner to salvation, Roasting away the soul's adulteration, And chopp'd and pinch'd him to a true believer. No longer are her priests to be maintain'd— Thus is that horrid beast the Dev'l unchain'd, That roaring bull at once his triumph shows— For, if not paid, what priests will prove their might, Fight the good fight, And, like staunch bull-dogs, nail him by the nose? Death and the Dev'l, the smutty rogue, and Sin, A pretty junto, are upon the grin; Hoping to fill the dark infernal hole, If all the priests refuse to help a soul— That most important contest then is o'er; Pull Dev'l, pull parson, will be seen no more. Yes, at her wounded pow'r Religion faints; Alas! no more old bones shall make new saints; No more shall Lent, lean lady, cry her fish; No more shall slices of the cross be courted; Despis'd the manger that our Lord supported, His sacred pap-spoon, and the Virgin's dish. No absolutions, like potatoes, sold; No purgatory-souls redeem'd by gold: No more in cloth of gold, and red-heel'd shoes, Bag-wig and sword, a mob the Saviour Once a year this fine mummery is exhibited in France, and in other Romish countries. views— Sold no certificates In some part of Russia, narrow slips of paper, in form of a ribbon, consecrated by the bishop, are sold for about three-pence a-piece, and bound about the heads of dying people. They are certificates of their good behaviour. The inscription on each is as follows:—‘To old God Almighty, to young God Almighty, and young God Almighty's mamma—this is to certify, that the bearer hereof died a good Christian,’ of good behaviour, To show the Lord, the Virgin, and that Saviour. No more shall Miracle obtain applause, Laugh at old Time, and break Dame Nature's laws; No more dead herrings, fill'd with life and motion, Leap from the frying-pan, and swim the ocean. Soon may this wicked spirit steal to Rome, And poison ev'ry sacred dome; Reliques be kick'd and mock'd by many a giber— The pontiff to the very workhouse brought, Or, what could never have been thought, Plump'd with his triple crown into the Tiber: There may we view him flound'ring wild about, With not a saint he dubb'd to pull him out: The fair chaste quills, from angel wings procur'd, Be turn'd to uses not to be endur'd; To villain pens, instead of crow-quills cut, To draw lew'd figures and deliver smut: Melted the church's sacred plate to mugs, To candlesticks, to punch-ladles, and jugs; To porringers the pipes Of the organs. of sacred tunes, And silver Christs to canisters and spoons. Phials that held of saints the suffering sighs, Seen by the dimmest of believing eyes, Lo, to the meanest offices shall sink— Hold aquafortis, or reviling ink! The Virgin's gowns and garters, stockings, shoes, Sold to her enemies, perhaps, the Jews— Her paint, curls, caps, hoop, gauzes, muslin, lace, Sold to trick harlots for a rogue's embrace! Now to disloyal mongrels we return. That bark at kings, and for confusion burn. How have our mighty monarchs been brought down! Trod in the dust, like some old wig, the crown! The wearers—some confin'd in jails so dread; Some shot—some poison'd with as much sang froid, As though the mob had merely been employ'd To knock a thieving polecat on the head. In birth the public sees no kind of merit! Think of the present equalizing spirit! Amidst the populace how rank it springs! Nay, from the palaces the Virtues fly, While boldly entering from their beastly stye, The vulgar passions rush to pig with kings! ODE III. The Poet sweetly reproveth the Emperor for neglecting to turn a penny in an honest Way, and demonstrateth the Inconveniency of Generosity —proving that a Mind on a broad Scale may be productive of narrow Circumstances. Great king, thou never educatest swine. Nor takest goslins under thy tuition; Nor boardest by the week thy neighbour's kine, Like Pharaoh's—that is, in a lean condition. Nor dost thou cut down palaces to pens, Nor sendest unto market cocks and hens; Nor to a butcher sellest pork and beef: Nor wool nor egg merchant, O king, art thou; Nor dost thou watch the girl who milks the cow, For fear the girl might sip, and prove a thief; Nor settest traps to save thy fowls and eggs, And catch thy loyal subjects by the legs.— Nor dost thou go a shopping, mighty king; I know that thou despisest such a thing; Yes, to expose such meanness thou art loath— Thou scorn'st to pride thyself on buying cheap, And for some trifle a huge pother keep, An ounce of blackguard A coarse snuff, so emphatically called., or a yard of cloth. Nor dost thou (which some people may deem strange) Send pages with a halfpenny for change; Nor dost thou (which would be a crying sin) Cheat of his dues the parson of Pe-kin. Thy mind was form'd upon an ampler scale: Each thought is generosity—a whale: Not a poor sprat to dunghills to be hurl'd— Thy soul a dome illum'd by Grandeur's rays, That o'er thy mighty empire casts a blaze; A beacon to inform a world. But, ah! Kien Long, thou never wilt be rich, If generosity thy heart bewitch: What says Œconomy? ‘Let subjects groan— Let Misery's howl be music to thine ear— Yes, let the widow's and the orphan's tear Fall printless on thy heart as on a stone.’ The souls of many kings are vulgar entries, With not a rushlight 'midst the dismal winding; A long, dark, dangerous, dreary way, past finding— Hypocrisy and Meanness the two sentries. Ambition, that on riches casts its eyes, Mounts on the tempest of a people's sighs! O emp'ror, Generosity's a fool— She wants advice from saving Wisdom's school. Look at a smiling field of grass: Nothing can eat it out, nor horse, nor ass, Provided that you put, to spare the feast, A padlock on the mouth of ev'ry beast. Thus, muzzle but thy palace now and then, Thou wilt be wealthy among scepter'd men. Invite not a whole million This is the number of the emperor's attendants, in general, at a hunt. to thine hunt: Thy purse with such a heavy weight would grunt. In England, when a king a deer unharbours, The sport a half a dozen butchers share; Of smutty chimney-sweeps perchaunce a pair; With probably a brace or two of barbers. What though 'tis not quite royal—still we boast Of gaining glorious fun with little cost. The pocket is a very serious matter— Small beer allayeth thirst—nay, simple water. The splendor of a chase, or feast, or ball, Though strong, are passing, momentary rays— The lustre of a liltle hour; that's all— While guineas with eternal splendor blaze. ODE IV. Peter breaketh out into a strange Rhapsody, so unlike Peter, who christeneth himself the Poet of the People—He adviseth the Emperor to Actions never practised by Kings!—Is it, or is it not, one continued Vein of happy Irony? Give nothing from thy privy purse away, I say— Nay, should thy coffers and thy bags run o'er, Neglect or pension Merit on the poor. Give not to hospitals—thy name's enough: To death-face Famine, not a pinch of snuff— On wealth thy quarry, keep a falcon-view, And from thy very children steal their due. Shouldst thou, in hunts, be tumbled from thy horse, Unlucky, 'midst some river's rapid course; Though sharp between thyself and Death the strife, Give not the page a sous that saves thy life. Should love allure thee to some fair-one's arms, Who yields thee all the luxury of charms, And deluges thy panting heart with blisses; Take not a sixpence from thy groaning chest, To buy a ribband for the fragrant breast That swell'd with all its ardour to thy kisses. Buy not a garland for her flowing hair; Buy not of mittins, or of gloves, a pair, To shield her hands from frost, or summer's ray; Buy not a bonnet to defend her face, Nor 'kerchief to protect each snowy grace, And deck her on some rural holiday. But suffer her in homely geer to pine, In simple elegance where others shine. Thou probably mayst answer, with a groan, ‘What! give a vile contagion to the throne! Perdition catch the wealth, in heaps that lies, Whilst trodden merit lifts her asking eyes. ‘That calf, shall garish Ostentation grin, Deck'd by the sweat of Labour's sun-burnt skin, Poor cart-horse, envied ev'n his very oats? Heav'ns! shall this mummer Ostentation cry, Roast in the sun, thou mob, in ashes lie; Mine be the guineas, slave, and thine the groats. ‘Mine be the luxury of wine and oil, Thine that I condescend to drink thy toil.’ Ah! say'st thou thus?—dares honour this high pitch? Then, noble emp'ror, thou wilt ne'er be rich. Gold should not gather in a subject's chest— The crew grows mutinous—it cannot rest; It talketh of equality, indeed! No, let the monarch's bags and coffers hold The flatt'ring, mighty, nay, all-mighty gold; On this shall brawny Pow'r his sinews feed; Jove's eagle near the throne, with eye of fire, The vengeance-bearer of the royal ire! Enrich the realm, Subordination dies— Wealth gives a wing that dashes at the skies. Blush not, though up to neck, to nose, in gold, To let thy fav'rite mandarine be told, ‘The emp'ror pants for money—hunt about:’ And should thy minister, with impious breath, Say, ‘Sire, we've squeezed the people nigh to death,’ Off with the villain's head, or kick him out. 'Tis pleasant to look down upon the hovel, And count the royal treasure with a shovel! Pleasant to mark the whites of wishing eyes, And hear of Poverty the fruitless sighs! Grand, on their knees to see the million cow'r; Pale, starv'd submsssion is the feast of pow'r. Pr'ythee, to Europe come, Kien Long, with speed: We'll give thee much instruction on this head; Nay, some examples also shall be brought, Which beats a cold dry precept all to nought. Precept's a pigmy, hectic, weak, and slight; Example is a giant in his might. Then, prythee, to our Europe haste to stare; Lo, Europe shall produce thee such a pair! A pair! to whom lean Av'rice is a fool, And means to take a lesson from their school. ODE V. Peter giveth an Account of the Expedition of Lord Macartney, and, contrary to the Tenour of the preceding Ode, absolutely recommendeth Generosity to the Emperor. Kien Long, our great great people, and 'Squire Pitt, Fam'd through the universe for saving wit, Have heard uncommon tales about thy wealth; And now a vessel have they fitted out, Making for good Kien Long a monstrous rout, To trade, and beg, and ask about his health. This to my simple and unconnying mind, Seems œconomical and very kind! And now, great Emperor of China, say, What handsome things hast thou to give away? Accept a proverb out of Wisdom's schools ‘Barbers first learn to shave, by shaving fools.’ Pitt shav'd our faces first, and made us grin— Next the poor French—and now the hopeful lad, Ambitious of the honour, seemeth mad To try this razor's edge upon thy chin. Thee as a generous prince we all regard; For ev'ry present, lo, returning double— 'Tis therefore thought that thou wilt well reward The ship and Lord Macartney for their trouble. And now to George and Charlotte what the presents? No humming-birds, we beg—no owls, no pheasants; Such gifts will put the palace in a sweat— For God's sake send us nothing that can eat. ‘What gifts, I wonder, will thy king and queen Send to Kien Long?’ thou cry'st.—Not much I ween; They can't afford it; they are very poor— And though they shine in so sublime a station, They are the poorest people in the nation, So wide of charity their neat trap-door Reader, this expression is uncommonly beautiful. —The most secret charities are generally the largest, and most acceptable to God.!!! Our king may send a dozen cocks and hens; Perhaps a pig or two of his own breeding; Perhaps a pair of turkeys from his pens; Perhaps a duck of his own feeding— Or possibly a half a dozen geese, Worth probably a half a crown a-piece; And that he probably may deem enough— Her gracious majesty may condescend Her precious compliments to send, Tack'd to a pound or two of snuff: The history of Strelitz too, perhaps; A place that cuts a figure in the maps. Most mighty emp'ror, be not thou afraid That we shall Generosity upbraid: Send heaps of things—poh! never heed the measure— If palaces won't hold the precious things, Behold, the best of queens and eke of kings Will build them barns to hold the treasure. I know thy delicacy's such, Thou fanciest thou canst send too much— But as I know the great ones of our isle, The very thought indeed would make them smile. Lord! couldst thou send the Chinese empire o'er, So hungry, we should gape for more: Yes, couldst thou pack the Chinese empire up, We'd make no more on't than a China cup; Ev'n then my Lady Schwellenberg would bawl, ‘Gote dem de shabby fella—vat, dis all?’ Whales very rarely make a hearty meal— Thus Princes an eternal hunger feel; Moreover, fond of good things gratis; Whose stomach's motto should be, nunquam satis. Then load away with rarities the ship, And let us cry, ‘She made a handsome trip’— But mind, no humming-birds, apes, owls, mackaws; The dev'l take presents that can wag their jaws. ODE. Simplicity, I doat upon thy tongue; And thee, O white-rob'd Truth, I've rev'renc'd long— I'm fond too of that flashy varlet Wit, Who skims earth, sea, heav'n, hell, existence o'er, To put the merry table in a roar, And shake the sides with laugh-convulsing fit. O yes! in sweet Simplicity I glory— To her we owe a charming little story. WILLIAM PENN, NATHAN, AND THE BAILIFF; A TALE. AS well as I can recollect, It is a story of fam'd William Penn, By bailiffs oft beset, without effect, Like numbers of our lords and gentlemen— William had got a private hole to spy The folks who came with writs, or ‘How d'ye do?’ Possessing, too, a penetrating eye, Friends from his foes the quaker quickly knew. A bailiff in disguise one day, Though not disguis'd to our friend Will, Came, to Will's shoulder compliments to pay, Conceal'd, the catchpole thought, with wondrous skill. Boldly he knock'd at William's door, Drest like a gentleman from top to toe, Expecting quick admittance, to be sure— But no! Will's servant Nathan, with a strait-hair'd head, Unto the window gravely stalk'd, not ran— ‘Master at home?’ the bailiff sweetly said— ‘Thou canst not speak to him,’ replied the man. ‘What,’ quoth the bailiff, ‘won't he see me then?’ ‘Nay,’ snuffled Nathan, ‘let it not thus strike thee; Know, verily, that William Penn Hath seen thee, but he doth not like thee.’ TO A FLY, TAKEN OUT OF A BOWL OF PUNCH. Ah! poor intoxicated little knave, Now senseless, floating on the fragrant wave; Why not content the cakes alone to munch? Dearly thou pay'st for buzzing round the bowl; Lost to the world, thou busy sweet-lipp'd soul— Thus Death, as well as Pleasure, dwells with Punch. Now let me take thee out, and moralize— Thus 'tis with mortals, as it is with flies, For ever hankering after Pleasure's cup: Though Fate, with all his legions, be at hand, The beasts, the draught of Circe can't withstand, But in goes every nose—they must, will sup. Mad are the passions, as a colt untam'd! When Prudence mounts their backs to ride them mild, They fling, they snort, they foam, they rise inflam'd, Insisting on their own sole will so wild. Gadsbud! my buzzing friend, thou art not dead; The Fates, so kind, have not yet snipp'd thy thread— By heav'ns, thou mov'st a leg, and now its brother, And kicking, lo, again thou mov'st another! And now thy little drunken eyes unclose; And now thou feelest for thy little nose, And finding it, thou rubbest thy two hands; Much as to say, ‘I'm glad I'm here again’— And well mayst thou rejoice—'tis very plain, That near wert thou to Death's unsocial lands. And now thou rollest on thy back about, Happy to find thyself alive, no doubt— Now turnest—on the table making rings; Now crawlihg, forming a wet track, Now shaking the rich liquor from thy back, Now flutt'ring nectar from thy silken wings Now standing on thy head, thy strength to find, And poking out thy small, long legs behind: And now thy pinions dost thou briskly ply; Preparing now to leave me—farewell, Fly! Go, join thy brothers on yon sunny board, And rapture to thy family afford— There wilt thou meet a mistress, or a wife, That saw thee drunk, drop senseless in the stream; Who gave, perhaps, the wide-resounding scream, And now sits groaning for thy precious life. Yes, go, and carry comfort to thy friends, And wisely tell them thy imprudence ends. Let buns and sugar for the future charm; These will delight, and feed, and work no harm— Whilst Punch, the grinning merry imp of sin— Invites th' unwary wand'rer to a kiss, Smiles in his face, as though he meant him bliss, Then, like an alligator, drags him in. ELEGY TO THE FLEAS OF TENERIFFE. Written in the Year 1768, at Santa Cruz, in Company with a Son of the late Admiral Boscawen, at the House of Mr. Mackerrick, a Merchant of that Place. Ye hopping natives of a hard, hard bed, Whose bones, perchaunce, may ache as well as ours, O let us rest in peace the weary head, This night—the first we ventur'd to your bow'rs. Thick as a flock of starlings on our skins, Ye turn at once to brown, the lily's white; Ye stab us also, like so many pins— Sleep swears he can't come near us whilst ye bite. In vain we preach—in vain the candle's ray Broad flashes on the imps, for blood that itch— In vain we brush the busy hosts away; Fearless on other parts their thousands pitch. And now I hear a hungry varlet cry, ‘Eat hearty, fleas—they're some outlandish men— Fat stuff—no Spaniards all so lean and dry— Such charming ven'son ne'er may come agen.’ How shall we meet the morn?—With shameful eyes! With nibbled hands, and eke with nibbled faces, Just like two turkey-eggs, we speckled rise, Scorn'd by the Loves, and mock'd by all the Graces. What will the stately nymph, Joanna Young Spanish ladies of the first fashion., say? How will the beauteous Catherina Young Spanish ladies of the first fashion. stare! ‘Away, ye nasty Britons—foh! away,’ In sounds of horror will exclaim the fair. What though we tell them 'twas Mackerrick's He is a principal man in the island, and much respected. bed? What though we swear 'twere all Mackerrick's fleas? Disgusted will the virgins turn the head; No more we kiss their fingers on our knees. No more our groaning verses greet their hand; No more they listen to our panting prose; No more beneath their window shall we stand, And serenade their beauties to repose. The conversationi At his excellency's the governor. meet their end; The love-inspir'd fandango warms no more! The laugh, the nod, the whisper, will offend; The leer, the squint, the squeezes, all be o'er. But, O ye ruthless hosts, an Arab train, Ye daring light troops of that roving race, Know ye the strangers whom with blood ye stain? Know ye the voyagers ye thus disgrace? One is a doctor, of redoubted skill, A Briton born, that dauntless deals in death; Who to the Western Ind proceeds to kill, And, probably, of thousands stop the breath: A bard, whose wing of thought, and verse of fire, Shall bid with wonder all Parnassus start; A bard, whose converse monarchs shall admire, And, happy, learn his lofty odes by heart Part of this prophecy has been amply verified. The other, lo, a pupil rare of Mars, A youth who kindles with a father's flame; Boscawen call'd, who fought a kingdom's wars, And gave to Immortality a name. Lo, such are we, freebooters, whom ye bite! Such is our British quality, O fleas!— Then spare our tender skins this one, one night— To-morrow eat Mackerrick, if ye please ODE TO MESSIEURS TOWNSEND, MACMANUS, AND JEALOUS, The Thief-takers, and Attendants on Majesty. The present unnatural and fatal Enmity towards those best Creatures in the World, Kings and Queens, putting our most august Couple more on their Guard against evil Machinations, by selecting Mr. Townsend, Mr. Mackmanus, and Mr. Jealous, the most accomplished Thief-takers upon Earth, to watch over them as a Garde de Corps; such an important Circumstance, so illuminative of the historical Page, could not escape the Eagle Eye of the Lyric Bard, who, in consequence, has addressed an Ode of Praise and Admonition to the three aforesaid Gentlemen. Ye friends to Justice Gibbet, Justice Jail, And Justice Cart's slow-moving tail, Accept the bard's sincere congratulation— Ye glorious imps, of thief-suppressing spirit, Elected, for your most heroic merit, The guardians of the rulers of the nation. When Blood, that enterprising chap, Attempted only on the crown a rape, Pale Horror rais'd her hands, and roll'd her eyes— But should some knave, with fingers most unclean, Attempt to steal away our king and queen, How would the empire in disorder rise! Just like the nations of the honied hive, Who, if they lose their sov'reign, never thrive. At midnight, lo, some knave might steal so sly, In silence, on the royal sleepy eye, And, giving to his sacrilege a loose, Bear off the mighty monarch on his back, Just as sly Reynard, in his night attack, Bears from the farmer's yard a gentle goose. Ye glorious thief-takers, O watch the pair; We cannot such a precious couple spare— O, cat-like, guard the door against Tom Paine! Tom Paine's an artful and rebellious dog, Swears that a sacred throne is but a log, And monarchs too expensive to maintain. I know their majesties are in a fright; I know they very badly sleep at night— Tom Paine's indeed a most terrific word; A name of fear, that sounds in ev'ry wind, A goblin damn'd, that haunts the royal mind; Of Damocles, the hair-suspended sword. Why should our glorious sov'reigns be unblest? Why by a paltry subject be distrest? Is there no poison for Tom Paine?—alas! Is there no halter for this knave of knaves? Audacious fellow! lo, the crown he braves, And calls the kingdom a poor burden'd ass. For this poor burden'd ass, he swears he feels, And bids him lift, a regicide, his heels. What a bright thought in George and Charlotte, Who, to escape each wicked varlet, And disappoint Tom Paine's disloyal crew, Fix'd on the brave Macmanus, Townsend, Jealous, Delightful company, delicious fellows, To point out, ev'ry minute, who is who! To hustle from before their noble graces, Rascals with ill-looking designing faces, Where treason, murder, and sedition dwell; To give the life of ev'ry Newgate wretch; To say who next the fatal cord shall stretch— The sweet historians of the pensive cell. O with what joy felonious acts ye view! How pleas'd, a thief or highwayman to hunt! Blest as Cornwallis Tippoo to pursue; Blest as old Purs'ram Bhow, and Hurry Punt! How itch your fingers to entrap a thief! How nimbly you pursue him!—with what soul Track him from haunt to haunt, to mercy deaf, And drag at last the felon from his hole! Thus when a chamber-maid a flea espies, How beats her heart! what lightnings fill her eyes! To seize him, lo, her twinkling fingers spread, And stop his travels through the realm of bed. He hops—the eager damsel marks the jump; Now sudden falls in thunder on his rump— She misses—off hops bloodsucker again: The nymph with wild alacrity pursues; Now loses sight of him, and now gets views, Whilst all her trembling nerves with ardour strain. Now fairly tir'd, with melancholy face, Poor sighing Susan quits th' important chase:— Once more resolv'd, she brightens up her wits, And, furious, to her lovely fingers spits— Thrice happy thought! yet, not to flatter, 'Tis not the cleanliest trick in nature. Now in the blanket deep she sees him hide, Who, winking, fancieth Susan cannot see; Now Susan drags him forth, with victor pride, The culprit crusheth; and thus falls the flea! What pity 'tis for this important nation, The princes all have had their education! What pounds on Gottingen were thrown away! How had ye moraliz'd their youngling hearts! How had ye giv'n an insight of the arts, So necessary, sirs, for sov'reign sway! Cunning's a pretty monitor for kings; She teacheth most extraordinary things; She keepeth subjects in their proper sphere; She brings that fool, the million, tame to hand, To dance, to kneel, to prostrate at command— A kingdom is a monarch's dancing bear. By means of this same humble capering beast, What royal showmen fill their fobs, and feast. O tell the world's great masters, not to spare— A subject's murmur is beneath their care: When well accustomed to the busy thong, Flogging's a matter of mere sport—a song. All know the tale of Betty and the eel— ‘You cruel b?h (a man was heard to say) To serve poor creatures in that horrid way!’ ‘Lord, sir,’ quoth Betty, turning on her heel, ‘The eels are us'd to it!’—so saying, And humming ça ira, continued flaying. O how I envy you each happy name! Time shall not eat the mountain of your fame; For thus myself your epitaph shall write, And dare the vile old stone-eater to bite. THE EPITAPH. ‘Here lie three crimps of death, knock'd down by Fate; Of justice the staunch blood-hounds too, so keen; Who chok'd the little plund'rers of the state, And, glorious, sav'd a mighty king and queen.’ BEHOLD, the guards, so disappointed, mourn! With jealousy their glorious bosoms burn, To find by you, dread sirs, usurp'd their places: ‘What! not the regiments of Death be trusted! By thief-takers, O Jesu! to be ousted! Thief-catchers gardes de corps unto their graces!’ Thus, thus exclaim the angry men in red, Who, with their swords and guns, may go to bed. Gods! how I envy our great folk their joys! Your tales of house-breakers, those nightly curses; Of heroes of the heath, Saint Giles's boys; Hist'ries of pocket-handkerchiefs and purses. O for minds-royal, what delightful food! Stories surpassing those of Robin Hood. Sweet are of slight-hand Barrington the tales; Of changeful Major Semple, charming too! Delicious story through each hulk prevails, Full of instruction, pleasant, sage, and new. Hence the pure streams of thieving science flow, Which through your mouths to gaping monarchs go; And frequently the royal gaze, ye greet With curious instruments, for robbing mete. Who would not wish to see the gliding crook, With whom the purses oft in silence stray? Who would not on the tools with rapture look, That from post-chaises snap the trunks away? Who would not ope false dice, ingenious bones? A curious speculation, worthy thrones. Laugh the loud world, and let it laugh again; The great of Windsor shall such mirth disdain— In days of yore, dull days, insipid things Kings trusted only to a people's love— But modern times in politics improve, And Bow-street runners are the shields of kings. ODE TO CÆLIA. Envy must own that thou art passing fair; Love in thy smiles, and Juno in thy air: Yet, Cælia, if with gods I may be free, I think that Jove commits a sort of sin, By stripping all the Graces to the skin, Merely to make a nonpareille of thee. Cælia, thou knowest too that thou art pleasing; Most spider-like, the hearts of mortals seizing; And what too maketh me confounded sour, Thou knowest what I wish to hide, Which rather mortifies my pride, That I'm a simple fly, and in thy pow'r. When Nature sent thee blooming from above, She meant thee to support the cause of love; To keep alive a beautiful creation— Thy graces hoarded, girl, thou must be told, Are really like the sordid miser's gold, Worthless, for want of circulation. Behold! a guinea, by a proper use, Another pretty guinea will produce; And thus, O peerless girl, thy beauty May bring thee cent. per cent. within the year; That is, another beauty may appear, If properly it minds its duty. Of wonder, lo, thou puttest on the stare— It seems a dark and intricate affair; Thou wantest a good, able, sound adviser— Well, then, my dear, at once agree, As chamber-counsel to take me; I know none better qualified, nor wiser. AN ODE TO A PRETTY MILLINER. O nymph, with bandbox tripping on so sweet, For Love's sake stay those pretty tripping feet, Join'd to an ancle, form'd all hearts to steal— That ancle to the neatest leg united, Perhaps—with which I should be much delighted For men by little matters guess a deal— Love lent thee lips, and lent that bloom divine— But, dearest damsel, what can make them mine? Heav'n rests upon those heaving hills of snow; The fascinating dimple in thy chin; In short, thy charms without, and charms within, Speak, are they purchasable?—aye, or no? Thou seest my soul wild staring from my eyes; Let me not burst in ignorance, fair maid— Why showest thou, O peerless nymph, surprise? I am no wolf to eat thee—why afraid? O could I gain by gold those heav'nly charms? Could gold once give thee to my eager arms, Lo, into guineas would I coin my heart; Those would I pour pell-mell into thy lap, With thee to wake to love, and then to nap, Then wake again—again to sleep depart. All happy circled in thy arms of bliss; To snatch, with riot wild, thy burning kiss; A kiss!—a thousand kisses let me add— Ten thousand from thy unexhausted mint, And then ten thousand of my own imprint— Speak, tempting Syren, to a swain stark mad. Heav'ns! o'er thy cheek how deep the crimson glows, And spreads upon thy breast of purest snows! Why mute, my angel? thou disdain'st reply? 'Sdeath! what a cuckoo, what a rogue am I! O nymph, so sweet, forgive my wild desires; That knave, thy bandbox, wak'd my lawless fires, Bade me suspect what Chastity reveres:— What will wipe out th' affront, O virgin, speak, That flush'd the rose of virtue on thy cheek, Chill'd thy young heart, and dash'd thine eye with tears? Go, guard that honour which I deem'd departed— O yield thy beauties to some swain kind-hearted, Whose soul congenial shall with thine unite, And Love allow no respite from delight. A MORAL AFTER-THOUGHT ON THE ABOVE. DEAR Innocence, where'er thou deign'st to dwell, The Pleasures sport around thy simple cell; The song of Nature melts from grove to grove; Perpetual sunshine sits upon thy vale; Content and ruddy Health thy hamlet hail, And Echo waits upon the voice of Love. But where—but where is scowling Guilt's abode? The spectred heath, and Danger's cavern'd road; The shuffling monster treads with panting breath; The cloud-wrapp'd storm insulting roars around, Fear pales him at the thunder's awful sound, He stares with horror on the flash of death. He calls on Darkness with affright, And bids her pour her deepest night; Her clouds impenetrable bring, And hide him with her raven wing! Are these the pictures? Then I need not muse, Nor gape, nor ponder which to choose— O Innocence, this instant I'm thy slave— What but the greatest fool would be a knave? A LYRIC EPISTLE TO SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON. Sir William! what, a new estate! I give thee joy of Gabia's A newly-discovered town, sister in misfortune to Herculaneum, Pompeia, and Pæstum. fate— More broken pans, more gods, more mugs, More snivel bottles, jordens, and old jugs, More saucepans, lamps, and candlesticks, and kettles, In short, all sorts of culinary metals! Leave not a dust-hole unexplor'd; Something shall rise to be ador'd— Search the old bedsteads and the rugs; Such things are sacred—if, by chance, Amidst the wood, thine eye should glance On a nice pair of antique bugs; Oh, in some box the curious vermin place, And let us Britons breed the Roman race! Old nails, old knockers, and old shoes, Would much Daines Barrington amuse; Old mats, old dish-clouts, dripping-pans, and spits, Would prove delectable to other wits; Gods' legs, and legs of old joint stools, Would ravish all our antiquarian schools. Some rev'rend moth, with ne'er a wing, Would charm the knight Sir Joseph Banks. of Soho-square: A headless flea would be a pretty thing, To make the knight of wonders stare. A curl of some old emp'ror's wig, Or Nero's fiddle, 'mid the flames of Rome, That gave so exquisite a jig, Believe me, would be well worth sending home. Oh, if some lumping rarity of gold, Thy lucky lucky eyes by chance behold, Send it to our good k??? and gracious q????: No matter what th' inscription—if there's none, 'Tis all one! Plain gold will please, as well as work'd, I ween— Much will the present their great eyes regale, Let it but cut a figure in the scale. Oh! could an earthquake shake down Wapping, And catch th' inhabitants and goods all napping, And then a thousand years the ruin shade, What fortunes would be quickly made! What rare musæums from the rubbish rise, Wapping antiquities to glad the eyes! How portraits of Moll Flanders, Hannah Snell, And Miss D'Eon, those heroines, would sell! Canning and Squires! How would the dilettanti of the nation Devour the prints with eyes of admiration! And to their merits, poets strike their lyres! Sign-posts, with Old Blue Boars, and heads of nags, Would from the proud possessor draw such brags! Red Lions, Crowns and Magpies, George the Third; The Cat and Gridiron, our most gracious Queen, With rapt'rous adoration would be seen; They would upon my word. Such would transport the people of hereafter, Though subjects now of merriment and laughter. POSTSCRIPT (sub rosâ). HIST!—what fresh ovens of Etrurian ware; What pretty jordens has my friend to spare? What gods are ripe for digging up, O knight? What Britons, knowing in the virtú trade, Soon as a grand discov'ry shall be made, Are near thee, gudgeon-like, prepar'd to bite? What brazen god, baptiz'd with chamber lye Sir William keeps an old antiquarian to hunt for him, who, when he stumbles on a tolerable statue, bathes him in urine, buries him, and when ripe for digging up, they proclaim a great discovery to be made, and out comes an antique for universal admiration., For which the future connoisseurs may sigh, Is going into ground, with front sublime? Hereafter to be worshipp'd soon as seen; A resurrection rare, array'd in green, A downright satire upon Time; Who seems, a poor old fumbling fool, to dote; Taking two thousand years to make a coat. A whisper—lock'd is the Musæum door Some valuable antiques, not long since, made their escape from the Royal Musæum, and travelled the Lord knows where. From whence antiques were wont to stray; Whose parents ne'er sat eyes upon them more, So much the little creatures lost their way? Pity thou couldst not news of them obtain, And send the gods and godlings back again! Sir William, what's become of that same monk He lived in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius, and furnished the knight with all his volcanic observations, which pass on the world as his own.—Nam quod emis, possis dicere jure tuum., From whose old corner-cupboard, or old trunk, Thine hist'ry issued about burning mountains? For who would toil, and sweat, and hoe the hill, To find, perhaps, of knowledge a poor rill, Who easily can buy the fountains? O knight of Naples, is it come to pass, That thou hast left the gods of stone and brass, To wed a deity of flesh and blood It is really true—the knight is married to a beautiful virgin, whom he styles his Grecian. Her attitudes are the most desirable models for young artists.? O lock the temple with thy strongest key, For fear thy deity, a comely she, Should one day ramble in a frolic mood. For since the idols of a youthful king, So very volatile indeed, take wing; If his, to wicked wand'rings can incline, Lord! who would answer, poor old knight, for thine? Yet should thy Grecian goddess fly the fane, I think that we may catch her in Hedge-lane The resort of the Cyprian corps, an avenue that opens into Cockspur-street.. EPIGRAM, On a Stone thrown at a very great Man, but which missed him. Talk no more of the lucky escape of the head, From a flint so unluckily thrown— I think very diff'rent, with thousands indeed, 'Twas a lucky escape for the stone. TO CHLOE. Dear Chloe, well I know the swain, Who gladly would embrace thy chain; And who, alas! can blame him? Affect not, Chloe, a surprise; Look but a moment on these eyes, Thou'lt ask me not, to name him. ON A NEW-MADE LORD. The carpenters of ancient Greece, Although they bought of wood a stubborn piece, Not fit to make a block—yet, very odd! No losers were the men of chipping trade, Because of this same stubborn stuff they made A damn'd good god! Thus, of the Lower House, a stupid wretch, Whose mind to A, B, C, can scarcely stretch, Shall, by a monarch's all-creative word, Become, a very decent lord. TO MY CANDLE. Thou lone companion of the spectred night, I wake amid thy friendly-watchful light, To steal a precious hour from lifeless sleep— Hark, the wild uproar of the winds! and hark, Hell's genius roams the regions of the dark, And swells the thund'ring horrors of the deep. From cloud to cloud the pale moon hurrying flies; Now blacken'd, and now flashing through her skies. But all is silence here—beneath thy beam, I own I labour for the voice of praise— For who would sink in dull Oblivion's stream? Who would not live in songs of distant days? Thus while I wond'ring pause o'er Shakespeare's page, I mark, in visions of delight, the sage, High o'er the wrecks of man, who stands sublime; A column in the melancholy waste (Its cities humbled, and its glories past), Majestic, 'mid the solitude of time. Yet now to sadness let me yield the hour— Yes, let the tears of purest friendship show'r. I view, alas! what ne'er should die, A form, that wakes my deepest sigh; A form that feels of death the leaden sleep— Descending to the realms of shade, I view a pale-ey'd panting maid; I see the Virtues o'er their fav'rite weep. Ah! could the muse's simple pray'r Command the envied trump of Fame, Oblivion should Eliza spare: A world should echo with her name. Art thou departing too, my trembling friend? Ah! draws thy little lustre to its end? Yes, on thy frame, Fate too shall fix her seal— O let me, pensive, watch thy pale decay; How fast that frame, so tender, wears away! How fast thy life the restless minutes steal! How slender now, alas! thy thread of fire! Ah, falling, falling, ready to expire! In vain thy struggles—all will soon be o'er— At life thou snatchest with an eager leap: Now round I see thy flame so feeble creep, Faint, less'ning, quiv'ring, glimm'ring—now no more! Thus shall the suns of science sink away, And thus of Beauty fade the fairest flow'r— For where's the giant who to Time shall say, ‘Destructive tyrant, I arrest thy pow'r?’ A POETICAL, SERIOUS, AND POSSIBLY IMPERTINENT, EPISTLE TO THE POPE. ALSO, A PAIR OF ODES TO HIS HOLINESS, On his keeping a Disorderly House; WITH A PRETTY LITTLE ODE TO INNOCENCE. ?Paulo majora canamus. VIRG. To kings and courtiers we have chirrup'd long— Muse, give we now His Holiness a song. PROLOGUE TO THE EPISTLE. ‘A cat may look upon a king;’ So says the proverb! and the proverb's right; For monarch now is prov'd a human thing; Although it lifts its nose to such a height. The Lord's anointed is an antique phrase, Left out by Dictionaries of our days. King-making unto man is justly giv'n— Once the great perquisite indeed of Heav'n. I say, a cat may look upon a king— But foreign potentates say, ‘No such thing.’ Sicilia's king, replete with right divine, Thinks he may hunt his subjects like his swine; And other continental kings, beside, For glory and blood-royal all agog, Think they may hunt a subject like a hog: This mortifies of us small rogues the pride. What hurts me more, and both my eyes expands, And lifts with horror from my head, my wig, Those birth-puff'd kings of foreign lands, To common Christians, have preferr'd the pig! A dead pig, to be sure, is better eating Than a dead Christian—handsomer for treating: But both alive—how diff'rent in their nature! Man surely is the much sublimer creature. Since cats may look upon a king, I hope A bard may write a letter to the Pope, Though hand and glove with Heav'n—a great conuexion! Who deals for souls, salvations from his wallet, As from their shops, green-grocers, for the palate, Deal garden-stuff of all complexion; And sells a good snug seat amidst the skies, To any wicked gentleman that dies; As unto John, Sir Will, my lord, his grace, Great Madam Schwellenbergen gives a place; A cook-like dame, who understands place-carving, And saves such worthy families from starving. So much for prologue to my Pope's Epistle; To which his holiness may cry, ‘Go—whistle.’ Perchance his holiness may also add, ‘P?x take me, Peter, if you ar'n't too bad: Dare fix thine impious foot on my dominions, I'll pay thee for epistles and opinions.’ Well then, since things are bonâ fide so, And Danger with his poniard lurks at Rome, I'll not set off to kiss your worship's toe; But wave the glory, and remain at home. A SERIOUS, THOUGH POSSIBLY IMPERTINENT, EPISTLE TO THE POPE. While France, for freedom mad, invades thy rights, And pours her millions o'er the world, like mites; Knocks the poor growling German o'er the snout, And threatens hard the man of cheese and grout; Gives poor Sardinia's monarch a black eye, And makes the Nimrod King of Naples cry; What's worse too, threaten poor Loretto's shrine, Where the good Virgin goes each day so fine She has a dress for every day in the year., Threatens to tear the muslin from her head, And put the cap The cap of liberty. of flannel in its stead; Where is th' Almighty's man, the church's hope, Prince of salvation, Peter's heir, the pope? O thou, the true descendant of Saint Peter, In very anger, lo, I pen this metre! There was a time when popes behav'd with spirit— But nought, save indolence, dost thou inherit. Go, ope thy churches, convents, all thy chapels, Since atheism with the true religion grapples; Think of thy ancestors so great of yore, And bid thy noble bull as usual roar; They whose stern looks could make an emp'ror cow'r, And kings like school-boys shudder at their pow'r. Most dangerous are the times—I scorn to flatter— Then ope thy cataracts of holy water; Gather thy crucifixes, wood, brass, stones; Bid the dark catacombs disgorge their bones; Create new regiments of saints for fight; And chase the gathering gloom of Pagan night. See France The author here does not mean to treat with unfeeling ridicule the fate of the unfortunate Louis, but merely to notice the extinction of monarchy and religion in France. against her rightful lord rebel! And see! her Satan banish'd from his hell! Blind wretch! now justly suff'ring for her evil! For what are states, without a king and devil? A pair so sweetly suited to control! Th' insurgent body, one; and one, the soul. To thee (thy slaves) the miracles belong; As music waits on Lady Mary's tongue, Humility on K?, void of art— As melting mercy hangs on B?'s heart. If marvels by thine ancestors were done, Why not perform'd, in God's name, by the son? As Becket, that good saint, sublimely rode, Thoughtless of insult, through the town of Strode, What did the mob?—Attack'd his horse's rump, And cut the tail so flowing, to the stump: What does the saint?—Quoth he, ‘For this vile trick, The town of Strode shall heartily be sick. And lo, by pow'r divine a curse prevails! The babes of Strode are born with horses' tails! Lodg'd in the talons of a famish'd kite, And just about to bid the world good night, A gentle goslin on Saint Thomas call'd! At once the feather'd tyrant look'd appall'd; Sudden his iron claw grew nerveless, loose, And dropp'd the sweet believing babe of goose. Such was the pow'r of saints, tho' dead and rotten, By thee (one verily would think) forgotten: Then, prithee, do at once thy best endeavour, As all the saints are wonderful as ever. Saint Dunstan can'd the Devil, the story goes, And pinch'd with red-hot tongs the imp's black nose; In vain he swore, and roar'd, and danc'd about— Sore was his back, and roasted was his snout. The pow'r he boasted, to his bones are giv'n: Such is the gift of saints, when lodg'd in heav'n. Hear with what blasphemy this France behaves! ‘Rome, I despise thee: all thy popes are knaves; Thy cardinals and priests the earth encumber— Avaunt the saints, and all such holy lumber! Chop off their heads; away the legs and toes: Away the wonder-working tooth and nose: Away the wonder-working eyes and tears, The vile imposture of a thousand years! Calves' heads, pigs' pettitoes, perform as well, Raise from the dead, and plagues and devils expel. Saint Genevieve no longer is divine— The wise Parisians mock her worm-gnaw'd shrine; Whose coffin planks that could such awe inspire, May go to light the kitchen-wench's fire. Saint Jail, Saint Whip, Saint Guillotine, Saint Rope, Possess (we think) more virtue than the pope. My wool-comber, my saddler, and my hatter No more Saint Blaize, Saint James, Saint Saviour flatter: My carpenter, my farrier, and my furrier, My fishmonger, my butcher, baker, currier, And eke a hundred trades besides, no more Bow to those marvel-mongers, and adore Every trade has its saints.. Hang me,’ the barber cries, ‘if I'm the fool To trim for nought the Virgin Mary's poll!’ ‘Burn me,’ cries Crispin, ‘if I don't refuse To find the gentlewoman in her shoes!’ ‘Curse me,’ the mercer cries, ‘if I give gowns, To be the laughing-stock of all our towns!’ ‘Damn me,’ the hosier roars, ‘if 'tis not shocking, That I should give the woman's legs a stocking! ‘And why,’ the linen man exclaims, ‘a pox, Should I, forsooth, be forc'd to find her smocks? No more shall bumpkins near the altar place Fair veal and mutton, for th' Almighty's grace; Grace to increase the loves of bulls and rams, And make more families of calves and lambs; No more shall capons too for grace be swapp'd, By priests ador'd, and in a twinkling snapp'd. My bumpkins, once such fools, think wiser now, That God without their aid can bless the cow, With due fertility the poultry keep, And kindle love sufficient for the sheep. On their past folly with amaze they stare, And mock the solemn mummery of pray'r; No more on Anthony's once hallow'd feast, The horse and ass shall travel to be blest; No more shall Hodge's prong and shovel start, Boot, saddle, bridle, wheelbarrow, and cart; No more in Lent shall wiser Frenchmen starve, While God affords them a good fowl to carve. Away with fasts—a fool could only hatch 'em— Frenchmen, eat fowls, wherever you can catch 'em. Let not the fear of hell your jaws control— A capon, trust me, never damn'd a soul. Heav'n kindly sends to man the things man chooses; And he's an impious blockhead who refuses. Melt all the bells to cannon with their grace; And, 'stead of demons, let them Austrians chase. Away with relics, holy water, oils, At which Credulity herself recoils! Lo, Kellerman's and Custine's gun-clad pow'r Will do more wonders with their iron show'r, Than all the saints and crosses of the nation, Since saints and crosses grew a foolish fashion. Let crucibles and crucifixes join, And silver saints perform their feats in coin; Make a good rubber of the Virgin's wig— Out with her ear-rings, and the dame unrig; Sell off her gowns and petticoats of gold! A piece of timber need not fear the cold. Out with the priests, to lust's wild phrensy fed, Who put the bridegroom and the bride to bed; One eye to Heav'n with sanctity applied, The other leering on the blushful bride; Who loads her in hot fancy with caresses, And cuckolds the poor bridegroom as he blesses! Perish the masses for a burning soul, That never yet extinguish'd half a coal! No more for sins let pilgrims visit Rome— Th' Almighty can forgive a rogue at home. Strike me that purgatory from our creed— Heav'n wants not fire to clarify the dead. Break me old Januarius's bottle; And let Contempt the old impostor throttle! A truce to pray'rs for saints in Heav'n to hear— 'Tis idle—since not one of them is there. Away with benedictions—canting matter! A horsepond is as good as holy water. Unveil the nuns, and useful make their charms; And let their prison be a lover's arms. I scout your porter Peter and his keys, That ope to ev'ry rogue a pope shall please. Avaunt the institutions that enslave! The man who thought of marriage was a knave; Rais'd a huge cannon against human bliss, And spoil'd that first of joys, the rapt'rous kiss; Delicious novelty from Beauty drove, And made the gloomy state the tomb of Love; To discord turning what had charm'd the ear: Converting Burgundy to sour small-beer. Thus from his bright domain a sun is hurl'd, To gild a pin-hole, that should light a world. Exulting Reason from her bondage springs, Claims Heav'n's wide range, and spreads her eagle wings; While Superstition, lodg'd with bats and owls, With Horror, and the hopeless maniac, howls.’ Thus crieth France! Thus Infidelity walks bold abroad, And, 'stead of Faith, the cherub, see a toad! Such is th' impiety of France, alas! And shall such blasphemy unpunish'd pass? No!—for the honour of Religion, rise, And flash conviction on their miscreant eyes. The French are devils—devils—downright devils; In heavenly wheat, accurs'd destructive weevils! Abominations! atheists, to a man; Rogues that convert the finest flour to bran; In Vice's drunken cup for ever guzzling; Just like the hogs in mud uncleanly nuzzling. I know the rascals have a sin in petto, To rob the holy lady of Loretto; Attack her temple with their guns, so warrish, And thrust the gentlewoman on the parish— A lady all so graceful, gay, and rich, With gems and wonders lodg'd in ev'ry stitch. Heir of Saint Peter, kindle then thine ire, And bid France feel thy apostolic fire; Think of the quantity of sacred wood Thy treasuries can launch into the flood; What ships the holy manger can create! At least a dozen of the largest rate— And, lo, enough of sweet Saint Martha's hair, To rig this dozen mighty ships of war. Our Saviour's pap-spoon, that a world adores, Would make a hundred thousand pair of oars. Gather the stones that knock'd down poor Saint Stephen, And fling at Frenchmen in the name of Heav'n; Bring forth the thousands of Saint Catherine's nails, That ev'ry convent, church, and chapel hails— For storms, uncork the bottled sighs of martyrs, And blow the rogues to earth's remotest quarters. Such relics, of good mother Church the pride, How would they currycomb a Frenchman's hide! Son of the church, again I say, arise, And flash new marvels in their sinner eyes; With teeth and jaw-bones on thy holy back, Thumbs, fingers, knuckle-bones, to fill a sack; With joints of rump and loins, and heels and toes, Begin thy march, and meet thy atheist foes: Struck with a panic shall the villains leap, And fly thy presence, like a flock of sheep. Thus shall the rebels to Religion yield, And thou with holy triumph keep the field. Thus in Jamaica, once upon a time, (Ah! well remember'd by the man of rhime!) Quako, high priest of all the negro nation, And full of negro faith in conjuration, Loaded his jackass deep with wonder-bags Of monkeys' teeth, glass, horse-hair, and red rags These little bags are called by the Negroes, obia, and are supposed to be possessed of great witchcraft virtues.; When forth they march'd—a goodly solemn pace, To pour destruction on the Christain race: To send the husbands to th' infernal shades, Hug their dear wives, and ravish the fair maids; To bring god Mumbo Jumbo into vogue, And sanctify the names of wh?and rogue! By Fortune's foot behold the scheme disjointed; And, lo, the black apostle disappointed! But mark! this diff'rence, to the world's surprise, Between your Holiness and Quako lies:— O'er France (no more an unbelieving foe, Who bought thy relics, and ador'd thy toe) Divine dominion shalt thou stretch, O pope, While luckless Quako only stretch'd—a rope. Where is the priest that cannot curse a rat, A weasel, locust, grasshopper, and gnat?— If journeymen can curse the reptile clan, The master certainly can curse a man. Father of miracles, then stir thy stumps, And break the legs of Sin, that takes such jumps; Fall not upon thy face, and cur-like yelp; And, panting, panic-stricken, cry—‘God help!’ To show that pray'r alone will not avail, The muse shall finish with a well-known tale. THE WAGGONER AND JUPITER. A LUCKLESS waggon roll'd into a slough— Clod scratch'd his head, and growl'd, and knit his brow; But what avail'd it?—Fast the waggon lay— Now Clod imagin'd, like an idle lout, A pray'r or two might help the pris'ner out; Then unto Jupiter he howl'd away. ‘How now! you lazy lubber!’ cried the god— ‘Clap to the wheel your shoulder, Master Clod; And, mind me, let your horses be well flogg'd.’— Clod took th' advice, exerted all his strength: The waggon mov'd, and mov'd; and lo, at length, Forc'd from the quagmire, on again it jogg'd. Such is the simple tale, O man of God! Go thou, and imitate the bumpkin Clod. I do not call your holiness a lubber; But let me tell thee, in an easy way, Contrive with skill this game of saints to play; Thou'lt beat thy ancestors, and win the rubber. ODE. [Let me confess that beauty is delicious] ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER. Just as I had finished my Epistle, it struck me that his Holiness kept a bad House at Rome— Marvelling Reader, nothing less than a large B?wdy House, from which he derives an Immensity of impure Emolument: so that this great Son of the Church, God's Vicegerent on Earth-taxes female Flesh, winks at Fornication, and consequently promotes the Cause of Carnality. Thus is a great Commandment broken, and Lasciviousness become sanctioned by the Successor of the Apostolic Peter. From this sad Circumstance probably the Bone, Wood, and Metal Conductors of Miracle, like the Electric Machine in foul Weather, will not answer so well; and consequently a Disappointment may attend the Experiments. The Bard therefore wishing the Moral Hemisphere to be as clear as possible, very properly addresses a Pair of reprimanding Odes to his Holiness on the Occasion, in sanguine Hopes of a Reformation. Let me confess that beauty is delicious: To clasp it in our arms, is nice—but vicious: That is to say, unlawful hugs—caresses Which want those bonds which God Almighty blesses. I do not say that we should not embrace: We may—but then it should be done with grace: The flesh should scarce be thought of—there's the merit: Sweet are the palpitations of the spirit! Pure are indeed the kisses of th' upright; So simple, meek, and sanctified, and slight! Good men so softly press the virgin lip! But wicked man! what does he, carnal wretch, With all his horse-like passions on full stretch? The mouth, sweet cup of kisses, scorns to sip— But with the spicy nectar waxing warm, The knave gets drunk upon the pouting charm; Seizes the damsel round the waist so handy; And, as I've said before, gets drunk, the beast, Like aldermen, the guttlers at a feast: For ladies' lips are cherries steep'd in brandy. The flaxen ringlets, and the swelling breast; The cheek of bloom; the lip, delightful nest Of balmy kisses, moist with rich desires; The burning blushes; and the panting heart; The yielding wishes that the eyes impart, Oft in our bosom kindle glass-house fires. Oh! shun the tempting nets that Satan spins! The highest pleasures are the deepest sins! Woman's a lovely animal, 'tis true— Too well, indeed, the lawless passions know it: Unbridled rogues, that wild the charm pursue, And madly with the scythe of Ruin mow it. Thus giving it of death the wicked wound— A tender flow'r stretch'd sweetly on the ground! ‘Ware lark,’ the sportsman to his pointer cries; Designing him for partridge—nobler game. As the soul's partridge is the skies, ‘Ware girl,’ should Piety exclaim. Blest is the simple man by virtue sway'd, Who wishful burns not for the blooming maid; Whose pulses calm as sleeping puppies lie; Who rusheth not to prey upon her charms, Full of Love's mad emotions, mad alarms, Just like a famish'd spider on a fly, That in the tyrant's claws resigns its breath, Unhappy humming till it sleeps in death. Blest is the man who marks the cherry lip, And sigheth not the nectar'd sweets to sip, Nor press the heaving hills of purest snow; Who marks the love-alluring waist so taper, Without one wish, or pulse's single caper, And to his hurrying passions cries out, ‘No! Stop, if you please, young imps, your hot career, And shun the precipice of Fate so near; Draw in, or, with the horses of the sun, You drive, like Phaëton, to be undone. O pope, I've heard that, when a friar (And Fame, in this, is not a liar), Thou oft didst smuggle beauty to thy cell, And, 'stead of flogging thy own sinful back, Didst give a sweet Italian girl the smack— The smacks indeed of love that lead to Hell. And lo, thou sinner, pope, instead Of counting ev'ry sacred bead, Thou wickedly didst count the damsel's charms: Instead of clasping the most holy cross, Such was of sanctity thy loss, Thou squeezed'st mortal limbs amid thy arms: Instead of kissing the most sacred wood, Lo, were thy lips defil'd by flesh and blood. Instead of psalmody, the skies to greet, In sinful catches didst thou deal, and glee; And lo, to put the angels in a sweat, Thou dandled'st the young harlot on thy knee, Singing that wanton song of shame, ‘A lovely lass to a friar came!’ Instead of begging gracious Heav'n, For all thy sins to be forgiv'n, Ready wert thou to manufacture more! Thy passions, ev'ry one a mutineer, Just like a cask of cider, ale, or beer, Fermenting, frothing, frisking, foaming o'er. The songs of harlots to thine ear, So full of witchery, were dear, And bosom of desire that hook'd thine eye! Dear as an execution to a judge, A well-known wight who seems to grudge Life and enjoyment to a fly; Who fond of hanging, robs the very cats, And on a gibbet mounts his captive rats And moles, To look like dangling men and maids, poor souls! Instead of loudly crying, ‘Let us pray,’ Thou in thy twilight cell so snug, Didst to an armful of rich beauty say— In whisper soft, ‘Bettina, let us hug.’ Instead of turning upwards thy two eyes Devoutly, for a blessing from the skies; What was thy most unhallow'd action? Oh! Vile didst thou cast those eyes on things below. ODE II. The world was never wickeder than now— Wedlock abus'd—her bond pronounc'd a jail; A wife call'd vilely ‘ev'ry body's cow, ‘A canister, or bone to a dog's tail!’ What dare not knaves of this degenerate day, Of marriage, decent hallow'd marriage say? ‘Wedlock's a heavy piece of beef, the rump! Returns to table, hash'd and stew'd, and fry'd, And in the stomach, much to lead ally'd, A hard unpleasant undigested lump: But fornication ev'ry man enjoys— A smart anchovy sandwich—that ne'er cloys— A bonne bouche men are ready to devour— Swallowing a neat half dozen in an hour. ‘Wedlock,’ they cry, ‘is a hard, pinching boot, But fornication is an easy shoe— The first won't suit; It won't do. ‘A girl of pleasure's a light fowling piece— With this you follow up your game with ease; That heavy lump, a wife, confound her! Makes the bones crack, And seems upon the sportsman's breaking back, A lumb'ring eighteen pounder. ‘One is a summer-house, so neat and trim, To visit afternoons for Pleasure's whim; So airy, like a butterfly so light; The other an old castle with huge walls— Where Melancholy mopes amid the halls, Wrapp'd in the doleful dusky veil of night.’ Then, pope, on fornication turn thy back: Oh, let it feel the thunder of attack! Most dangerous is this habit, sir, of sinning: Hang all the bawds; for where's a greater vice, Than taking in young creatures, all so nice? And yet to them, 'tis merely knitting, spinning— No more! Although the innocent is made a wh?. With just as much sang froid, as at their shops The butchers sell rump steaks, or mutton chops, Or cooks serve up a fish, with skill display'd, So an old abbess for the rattling rakes, A tempting dish of human nature makes, And dresses up a luscious maid: I rather should have said, indeed, undresses, To please a youth's unsanctified caresses. Thus, in the practices of fleshy evil, They're off upon a gallop to the Devil; Yet deem themselves, poor dupes, cocksure of heav'n— As though salvation could to bawds be giv'n, To jades encouraging those rebel fires, Pepper'd propensities, and salt desires; Curs'd by the Bible, if we trust translators; Which sayeth, ‘Woe be to all fornicators.’ At Rome, each hour, are horrid actions done! By thee approv'd, thou dar'st not, pope, deny: Yes, yes, the lawless places are well known, Where youth for venal pleasures madly fly, Bargain for beauteous charm, and pick, and cull it, As at a poulterer's Betty turns a pullet. I like examples of a wicked act— Take, therefore, reader, from the bard a fact. An old procuress groaning, sighing, dying, A rake-hell enters the old beldame's room— ‘Hæ, mother! thinking on the day of doom? ‘Hæ—dam'me, slabb'ring, whining, praying, crying? Well, mother! what young filly hast thou got, To give a gentleman a little trot?’ ‘O captain, pray, your idle nonsense cease, And let a poor old soul depart in peace! What wicked things the Dev'l puts in your head, Where can you hope to go, when you are dead?’ ‘How now, old beldame?—shamming Heav'n with praying! Come, come, to bus'ness—don't keep such a braying; Let's see your stuff—come, beldame, show your ware; Some little Phillis, fresh from country air.’ ‘O captain, how unpiously you prate! Well, well, I see there's no resisting fate; Go, go to the next room, and there's a bed— And such a charming creature in't—such grace! Such sweet simplicity! and such a face!— Captain, you are a devil—you are, indeed. ‘I thank my stars that nought my conscience twits; Which to my parting soul doth joy afford; O captain, captain! what, for nice young tits, What will you do, when I am with the Lord?’ REFLECTION. Such was the fact! thus was this bawd persuaded, Heav'n's massy door would not be barricaded! Sure, in her mind, that Peter would unlock it! Thus had her soul thy passport in its pocket. ODE TO INNOCENCE. Though the Author has so severely reprimanded His Holiness for his Incontinency, he, with the utmost Candour, suspecteth his own Frailty. O nymph of meek and blushful mien, Lone wand'rer of the rural scene, Who lovest not the city's bustling sound, But in the still and simple vale Art pleas'd to hear the turtle's tale, 'Mid the gay minstrelsy that floats around! Now on the bank, amid the sunny beam I see thee mark the natives of the stream, That break the dimpling surface with delight; Now see thee pitying a poor captive fly, Snapp'd from the lov'd companions of his joy, And, swallow'd, sink beneath the gulf of night. Now see thee, in the humming golden hour, Observant of the bee, from flow'r to flow'r, That loads with varied balm his little thighs, To guard against chill Winter's famish'd day, When rains descend, and clouds obscure the ray, And tempests pour their thunder thro' the skies. Now see thee happy, with the sweetest smile, Attentive stretch'd along the fragrant soil, Beholding the small myriads of the plain, The pismires, some upon their sunny hills, Some thirsty wand'ring to the crystal rills, Some loaded bringing back the snowy grain; So like the lab'ring swains, who yet look down Contemptuous on their toils and tiny town! Now see thee playful chase the child of spring, The winnowing butterfly with painted wing, That busy flickers on from bloom to bloom; Pursuing wildly now a fav'rite fair, Circling amid the golden realm of air, And leaving, all for love, the pea's perfume. Now see thee peeping on the secret nest, Where sits the parent wren in patient rest; While at her side her feather'd partner sings; Chants his short note, to charm her nursing day; Now for his loves pursues his airy way, And now with food returns on cheerful wings. Pleas'd could I sit with thee, O nymph so sweet, And hear the happy flocks around thee bleat; And mark their skipping sports along the land; Now hear thee to a fav'rite lambkin speak, Who wanton stretches forth his woolly neck, And plucks the fragrant herbage from thy hand. Thus could I dwell with thee for many an hour: Yet, should a rural Venus from her bow'r Step forth with bosom bare, and beaming eye, And flaxen locks, luxuriant rose-clad cheek, And purple lip, and dimpled chin, so sleek, And archly heave the love-seducing sigh; And cry, ‘Come hither, swain—be not afraid; ‘Embrace the wild, and quit the simple maid’— I verily believe that I should go: Yet, parting, should I say to thee, ‘Farewel— I cannot help it—Witchcraft's in her cell— The passions like to be where tempests blow— Go, girl, enjoy thy fish, and flies, and doves; But suffer me to giggle with the Loves.’ Thus should I act—excuse me, charming saint: An imp am I, in Virtue's cause so faint; Like David in his youth, a lawless swain! Preferring (let me own with blushing face) The storms of Passion to the calms of Grace; One ounce of pleasure to a pound of pain. PATHETIC ODES. THE DUKE OF RICHMOND's DOG THUNDER. AND THE WIDOW's PIGS; A TALE. THE POOR SOLDIER OF TILBURY FORT.—ODE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN SOLDIERS.—ODE TO EASTERN TYRANTS.—THE FROGS AND JUPITER; A FABLE.—THE DIAMOND PIN AND CANDLE; A FABLE.—THE SUN AND THE PEACOCK; A FABLE. Far off the hero bleeds in Brighton wars, At least his horse's ribs so glorious bleed: Where, nobly daring danger, death, and scars, He flies and rallies on his bounding steed. EPISTLE DEDICATORY, TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF RICHMOND. ODE. [Though huge to us this flying world appears] The Poet giveth Philosophy's modest and sublime Picture of Infinity, a Picture damned by the great Folk of the present Day.—Peter maketh a most sagacious Discovery of a Connexion never thought of before, viz. between Folly and Grandeur. —He talketh of Wisdom, and abuseth the Blindness of the Vulgar.—He talketh of Flattery. —He plumply contradicteth the Vulgar, and advanceth unanswerable Reasons.—He descanteth on Mind and Body, proving that a Horsewhip is as necessary for the one as the other.—The wise and elegant Speech of the 'Squire, or elder Brother.—The Poet discovereth Distance to be the Parent of Admiration, and confuteth the Opinion of Mob, by a pantomimical Illustration. —Peter attacketh many great Men, most aptly making Use of a Windmill and a Warming -pan.—He selecteth one great and good Man from the herd of bad. Though huge to us this flying world appears, And great the bustle of a thousand years; How small to him who form'd the vast of nature! One trembling drop of animated water Consult the wonders of the microscope.! ‘What are we?—Reptiles claiming Pity's sigh, Though in our own conceits so fiercely stout; Nay, such small wights in Providence's eye, As asks Omnipotence to find us out.’ So says Philosophy.—‘Fudge, cant, mere words, Trash, nonsense, impudence,’ cry kings and lords. Ah, sirs! believe the sacred truths I tell— Folly and Grandeur oft together dwell: Folly with Title oft is seen to skip, Stare from his eye, and grin upon his lip. Wisdom descendeth not from king to king, Or lord to lord, like an estate; The present day believeth no such thing— Matters are vastly chang'd of late. What says Experience from her sober school? ‘Nature on many a titled front writes fool. But, lo! the vulgar world is blind, stone blind; The beast can see no writing of the kind; Or if it sees, it cannot read— Now this is marvellous indeed.’ Hark to the voice of Flatt'ry! thus she sings— ‘Gods of the earth are emp'rors, popes, and kings; Godlings, our dukes and earls, and such fine folk.’ And thus the liar Flatt'ry sung of yore; The fascinated million cry'd encore, For Wisdom was too young to smell the joke. Wide was the sphere of Ignorance, alas! And faint, too faint, of Truth's young sun the ray; Too feeble through th' immense of gloom to pass, And beaming chase a world of fog away. Ye Vulgar cry, ‘Great men are wondrous wise.’— Whoever told you so, told arrant lies: It cannot be.—Not! why?—Hear me, pray, They are so dev'lish lazy, let me say. The mind wants lusty flogging, to be great: To use a vulgar phrase, ‘The mind must sweat.’ Now men of worship will not sweat the mind; Meat, clothes, and pleasure, come without, they find. What man will make a drayhorse of the soul, To drag from Science's hard quarry, stone, Who really wanteth nothing from the hole— A toil which therefore may be let alone? Th' idea seems so wondrously uncouth, As maketh ev'ry elder brother start; Who openeth thus his widely-grinning mouth, ‘Fine fun, indeed, for me to drag a cart! ‘Let younger brothers join it, if they please; Old Square-toes, thank my God, has caught my fleas.’ Suppose ye want a fine strong fellow?—speak, Where for this fine strong fellow would ye seek? ‘Seek! seek a drayman,’ with one voice ye cry; ‘A chairman or a ploughman, to be sure; Men who a constancy of toil endure; Such are the fellows that we ought to try.’ This then is granted—well then, don't ye find Some likeness 'twixt the body and the mind? Distance has wonderful effects indeed; But, sirs, this is not ev'ry body's creed: Mob is not in the secret—that's the case; Mob deemeth great men gods!—yes, ev'ry where, Far off, or near. Now let a short remark or two take place. First, I assure you that things are not so; By G?d, they are not gods.—I pray ye, go To pantomimes, where fine cascades and fields, And rocks, a huge delight to Wonder yields: Approach them—what d'ye find the frowning rocks? Lord! what imagination really shocks! Black pairs of breeches, scarcely worth a groat: What are the fields so flourishing? green baize, The objects of your most astonish'd gaze: What the cascade? a tinsel petticoat, And tinsel gown upon a windlass turning The fields and rocks so nat'rally adorning. Great men, I've said it, often are great fools, Great sycophants, great swindlers, and great knaves; Too often bred in Tyranny's dark schools, Happy to see the under-world their slaves. Great men, at diff'rent times, are diff'rent too; More so when int'rest is the game in view. A windmill and a warming-pan, no doubt, Are most unlike each other in their nature; Yet, trust me, the same man, in place and out, Is to the full as opposite a creature. Yet some great men are good!—and, by mischance, Their eyes on mis'ry will not always glance; As, for example, Richmond's glorious grace, A duke of most unquestionable merit, With Merc'ry's cunning, and dread Mars's spirit, Who took the Ordnance, a tremendous place! This Duke of Thunder is for ever spying; To find out objects of sheer merit, trying: How happy too, if objects of distress; Thus is his Grace of Guns ador'd by all; For this, where'er he rides, both great and small, Him and his horse, with eyes uplifted, bless. This Turenne A French General, of the last century, possessed of the sublimest qualities. would be sorry, very sorry, Should one pale form of want his eye escape: ‘No,’ cries his grace, ‘Misfortune shall not worry, Whilst I a sixpence for the poor can scrape,’ How much like majesty in Windsor town, Hunting for Pity's objects up and down! Yet since distress has 'scap'd his grace's eye, The muse o'er Tilb'ry Fort shall breathe a sigh. Yet ere on Tilb'ry Fort we drop a tear, Lo! with a tale we treat the public ear— Relate a pretty story of his grace: Much will the tale his grace's soul display— Happ'ning ('tis said) at Goodwood on a day— 'Twill put a smile or frown on ev'ry face. THE DUKE OF RICHMOND's DOG THUNDER, AND THE WIDOW's PIG. The Widow's whole Fortune lodged in the Sow. —Her Joy on the Sow's lying-in.—The Duke's Dog Thunder much like Courtiers.—Thunder killeth the young Pigs, yet surpasseth Courtiers in Modesty.—The Sow crieth out.—The Widow joineth the Sow in her Exclamations.—The old Steward cometh forth at the Cry of the Sow and Widow, and uttereth a most pathetic Exclamation. —A sensible Dissertation on the different Species of Compassion.—The Widow's piteous Address to his Grace.—His Grace's humane and generous Answer to the Widow. A dame near Goodwood own'd a sow, her all, Which nat'rally did into travail fall, And brought forth many a comely son and daughter; On which the widow wondrously was glad, Caper'd and sung, as really she were mad— But tears oft hang upon the heels of laughter. At Goodwood dwelt the duke's great dog, call'd Thunder, A dog, like courtiers, much inclin'd to plunder; This dog, with courtier-jealousy so bitter, Beheld the sweetly-snuffling sportive litter. Bounce! without ‘by your leave,’ or least harangue, Upon this harmless litter, Thunder sprang, And murder'd brothers, sisters, quick as thought; Then sneak'd away, his tail between his rear, Seeming asham'd—unlike great courtiers here, Who (Fame reporteth) are asham'd of nought. The childless sow set up a shriek so loud! All her sweet babies ready for the shroud; Now chas'd the rogue that such sad mischief work'd; Out ran the dame—join'd Mistress Sow's shrill cries; Burst was at once the bag that held her sighs, And all the bottles of her tears uncork'd. ‘Oh! the duke's dog has ruin'd me outright; Oh! he hath murder'd all my pretty pigs.’ Forth march'd the steward, grey, with lifted sight, And lifted hands, good man, and cry'd ‘Odsnigs!’ Word of surprise! which, with a plaintive tone, And rueful countenance, and hollow groan, Did seem like pity also, for her case: Yet what's odsnigs, or moan, or groan, or sighs, Unhelp'd, by Famine if the object dies? Or what a yard of methodistic face? Compassions differ very much, we find! One deals in sighs—now sighs are merely wind: Another only good advice affords, Instead of alms—now this is only words: Another cannot bear to see the poor; So orders the pale beggar from the door. Now that compassion is the best, I think (But, ah! the human soul it rarely graces), Instead of groans, which giveth meat and drink; Off'ring long purses too, instead of faces. But, muse, we drop dog, duke, and sow, and dame, To follow an old pitiful remark; Like wanton spaniels that desert the game, To yelp and course a butterfly or lark. Now to his Grace the howling widow goes, Wiping her eyes so red, and flowing nose. ‘Oh! please your Grace, your Grace's dev'lish dog, Thunder's confounded wicked chops Have murder'd all my beauteous hopes— I hope your Grace will pay for ev'ry hog.’ What answer gave his Graee?—With placid brow, ‘Don't cry,’ quoth he, ‘and make so much foul weather— Go home, dame; and when thunder eats the sow, I'll pay for all the family together.’ ODE TO A POOR SOLDIER OF TILBURY FORT. The Poet pronounceth the very great Shyness subsisting between Merit and Money.—Merit's Connexion with Poverty, and the Consequence. Attack on Fortune.—Address to the poor Soldier. He pitieth the poor Soldier's pitiable Fate, viz. his ragged Coat, hungry Stomach, and Want of Fire.—His Companions on the Mud. —Peter smileth at the Hubbub made on Account of a Shot-hole in the little Coat of a great Prince, a Remnant of Glory that may probably add another Ray to the Lustre of St. Paul's.—Peter most pathetically inquireth for his Grace—proclaimeth him to be at Brighton, most heroically engaged.—The different Amusements of his Grace at Brighton, awake and asleep.—Crumbs of Consolation to the poor Soldier. Merit and Money very seldom meet; Form'd for each other, they should oftener greet; Indeed much oftener should be seen together: But Money, vastly shy, doth keep aloof; Thus Poverty and Merit beat the hoof, Expos'd, poor souls, to every kind of weather. Thus as a greyhound is meek Merit lean, So slammakin, untidy, ragged, mean, Her garments all so shabby and unpinn'd: But look at Folly's fat Dutch lubber child; How on the tawdry cub has Fortune smil'd When with contempt the goddess should have grinn'd! So much for preamble; and now for thee, Whose state forlorn his Grace could never see. Poor Soldier, after many a dire campaign, Drawn mangled from the gory hills of slain, Perhaps the soul of Belisarius thine; Why with a tatter'd coat along the shore, Where Ocean seems to heave a pitying roar, Why do I see thee thus neglected pine? Poor wretch! along the sands condemn'd to go, And join a hungry dog, or famish'd cat, A pig, a gull, a cormorant, a crow, In quest of crabs, a muscle, or a sprat! Now, at Night's awful, pale, and silent noon, Along the beach I see thee lonely creep, Beneath the passing solitary moon, A spectre stealing 'mid the world of sleep. Griev'd at thy channell'd cheek, and hoary hair, And quiv'ring lip, I mark thy famish'd form, And hollow jellied orbs that dimly stare, Thou piteous pensioner upon the storm. The muse's handkerchief shall wipe thine eye, And bring sweet Hope to sooth the mournful sigh. Deserted hero! what! condemn'd to pick, With wither'd, palsy'd, shaking, wounded hand, Of wrecks, alas! the melancholy stick, Thrown by the howling tempest on the strand? Glean'd with the very hand that grasp'd the sword, To guard the throne of Britain's sacred lord! While Cowardice at home from danger shrinks, And on an empire's vitals eats and drinks. Heav'ns! let a spent and rambling shot Touch but a prince's hat or coat, Expanded are the hundred mouths of Fame; Whilst braver thousands (but untitled wretches), Swept by the sword, shall drop like paltry vetches, Their sate unpitied, and unheard their name! Poor soldier! is that stick to make a fire, To warm thyself, and wife, and children dear? Where is the goodly duke—of coals the 'squire, Whose heart hath melted oft at Mis'ry's tear? And, vet'ran! is that coat thy ragged all? Sport of the saucy winds and soaking rain! For this has Courage fac'd the flying ball? For this has bleeding Brav'ry press'd the plain? Where is the man who mocks the grin of Death, Turns Bagshot pale, and frightens Hounslow Heath? Far off, alas! he bleeds in Brighton wars; At least his horse's ribs so glorious bleed; Where, nobly daring danger, death, and scars, He flies and rallies on his bounding steed. There too his Grace may wield his happy pen, To prove that truly great and valiant men, In idle duels never should engage, But nurse for dread reviews their godlike rage. Far off, the hero, in his tent reclin'd, Where high and mighty meditations suit, On leather, leather, turns his lofty mind, To make a cannon of an old jack-boot! Great geniuses, how loftily they jump! Lord! what his rapture when he deigns to ride! To feel beneath his Grace's gracious rump, An eighteen pounder in his horse's hide! There too, to barracks, fir'd in Freedom's cause, And to Mount Wyse A place near Plymouth Dock, on which the national treasure has been so wisely expended for the innumerable conveniences of his brother Lennox., his lyre the hero tunes; There too the pow'r of doating Fancy draws The Royal George to sight by air-balloons This was actually proposed by his Grace, with every sanguine idea of success.. This, Fanc'ys pow'r most earnestly can dare— By Fancy's pow'r the royal ship may rise, Borne by her bladders through the fields of air, Just like a twig, by rooks, along the skies. There too, at midnight drear, the hero schemes, 'Midst hum and snore of troops, for England's good; Explores machines of death in happy dreams, For hills of bones, and cataracts of blood. There, like King Richard, whom the furies rend, He bustles in his sleep, and starts, and turns; Now grasps the sword, and now a candle end, That, blazing like himself, beside him burns. Thus, 'mid his tent reclin'd, the godlike man Vast schemes in slumber spins for England's sake; ‘And, lo!’ quoth Fame, ‘his godlike Grace can plan As wisely in his sleep as when awake.’ When with his host, Caligula came over, No matter where—for rhime-sake call it Dover— What were the trophies hence to Rome he bore? Of paltry perriwinkles just a score! But Richmond from his Brighton wars shall bring Life to the state, and safety to a king! Blest man! from Brighton field, with laurels crown'd, He triumphs up the town without a wound The poet seems to have forgotten himself: his motto talks a different language: but the quidlibet audendi belongs as much to P. P. as to every other poet.; From Brighton wars, that witness'd not a corse! Most lucky, losing neither man nor horse! Thus then, O soldier, distance hides his Grace; Thus is the sun, at times, of clouds the sport: Yet soon the glories of his lordship's face Shall, like a comet, blaze o'er Tilb'ry fort. There shall the muse thy piteous tale unfold, Gain thee a coat, and coals, to kill the cold; Nay, fat shall swim upon thy meagre porridge: The sympathizing duke her tale will hear, And drop, at sound of coat and coals, a tear— For Richmond's bounty equals Richmond's courage. ODE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN SOLDIERS, IN CERTAIN PAY. A complimentary Address to the Soldiers.— Wholesome Advice.—Peter draweth a natural and pathetic Picture of poor little Louis, reported to have been disgracefully put an Apprentice to a Cobbler.—The Insolence and Cruelty of his Master the Cobbler.—The Cobbler blasphemously abuseth Title.—The little Cobler King crieth.—Sensible Reflections on the Genius of Kings, with a Lick at the French Convention, and also at his own Stupidity.— Peter supplicateth for the little Louis.—Adviseth the Soldiers to a bold Action.—Inquireth of Soldiers who is to receive their Death-money. —Peter comforteth, and reconcileth them to Death. Peter blesseth the King and the War, and curseth Reform, a Word in the Mouths of Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond before they got into Office. —Peter adviseth more taxes, for a weighty political Reason, videlicit, on Account of the Impudence of a Nation, which always increaseth in an insufferable ratio with Riches. Ye heroes, from your wives and turnips far, Who wage so gloriously the flying war, I give you joy of hand and leg endeavour; And though ye sometimes chance to run away, The generous General Murray's pleas'd to say, ‘'Tis very great indeed—'tis vastly clever.’ O cut the Frenchmen's throats, the restless dogs! O with the tiger's gripe upon them spring! A pack of vile, degrading, horrid hogs; To make a dirty cobbler of a king! See stool-propp'd majesty the leather spread! Behold his pretty fingers wax the thread, And now the leather on the lap-stone, hole; Now puts his majesty the bristle in, Now wide he throws his arms with milk-white skin, And now he spits and hammers on the sole. And, lo! a rascal christen'd sans-culotte, Leers on the window of his shed; and, lo! He bawls (without of awe a single jot) ‘Come, Master King—quick, sirrah, mend my shoe.’ And see! the shoe the little monarch takes, And, lo! at ev'ry stitch with fear he quakes— Such is of Liberty the blessed fruit! The name Licentiousness would better suit. Behold Saint Crispin's picture, strange to tell, The low-life cobbler's tutelary saint, Of little Louis deck the dirty cell; How diff'rent from the lofty Louvre's paint! See! his hard master catches up the strap, And lashes the young king's poor back and side— How! flog his majesty!—for what mishap? Ye gods! because he spoil'd a bit of hide! Nay, hear the cruel tyrant thus exclaim: ‘Sirrah, there's nothing in a lofty name; ‘'Tis all mere nonsense, sound, and stuff together: Don't think, because thy ancestors, so great, Have to a paring brought a glorious state, I give thee leave to spoil a piece of leather.’ And now behold the little tears, like peas, Course o'er his tender cheek in silence down; And now, with bitter grief, he feels and sees The diff'rence 'twixt a stirrup and a crown. Folly! to make a cobbler of a king! 'Tis such a piece of madness to my mind! What could Convention hope from such a thing? The race is fit for nothing—of the kind. Heav'ns! then how dull I am!—It was disgrace France meant to put upon the royal race; ‘Aye, and disgrace upon the cobbler too,’ Most impudently roars the man of shoe. O from the lap-stone set the monarch free! O snatch the stirrup from his royal knee; Pull the hand-leather off and seize the awl! Seize too the hammer that his fingers gall! Soldiers! to Paris rush—strike Robespierre, Knock Danton down, and crucify Barrere; Crush the vile egg which from the serpent springs, To dart th' envenom'd fang at sacred kings. O soldiers, whose your skin-money, I pray? At thirty guineas each—how dear your hides! Much should I like the contract, let me say: Thrice lucky rogue, that o'er your lives presides! Then pray don't grumble, sirs, should ye be shot; That is to say, if ye desire to thrive; For know, if death should prove your lucky lot, You're worth a vast deal more than when alive. POSTSCRIPT. NOW God bless our good king, and this good war, And d?mn that wicked word we call Reform; Breeding in Britain so much horrid jar, So witch-like, conj'ring up a dangerous storm! Yet in the mouths of Pitt and Richmond's lord, Once what a sweet and inoffensive word! Thus proving the delightful proverb true, ‘What's meat to me, may poison be to you.’ And now God bless once more good Mister Pitt, Who for invention beats nineteen in twenty; And may this gentleman's most ready wit Supply the nation all with taxes plenty; And as the kingdom has unclench'd its fist, Pick out a few odd pence for civil list. We are too rich—Dame Fortune grows too saucy, Wealth is inclin'd to be confounded brassy. War is a wholesome blister for the back; Draining away the humours all so gross; Else would the empire be of guts a sack— A Falstaff—woolsack—an unwieldy joss. War yieldeth such rare spirits to a nation! Giving the blood so brisk a circulation! A kingdom, and a poet, and a cat, Should never, never, never be too fat. ODE. [A cat who from a window peepeth out] Cats and Princes very much alike. A cat who from a window peepeth out, ‘Is very like a cat who peepeth in’— Thus it is said—and he who is no lout, Knoweth that cats are unto men akin. For princes looking up towards a throne, Are very much like princes looking down; That is, love pow'r, love wealth, have great propensities, Sublimely dealing ever in immensities. Princes have clawing passions too, I ween— Yes, many a foreign king and foreign queen; With stomachs wide too as a whale's, or wider: The subject and a king, in foreign land, I often have been giv'n to understand, Are a poor jack-ass and his rider. ODE TO TYRANTS. Peter, with his poetical Broomstick, belaboureth foreign Tyrants.—Taketh the Part of the oppressed Poor.—Asketh Tyrants knotty and puzzling Questions.—Giveth a Speech of Cato.—Peter seriously informeth them that they are not like the Lord.—Peter taketh a Survey of the Furniture of their Heads.—Peter solemnly declareth that the Million doth not like to be ridden. —Giveth an insolent Speech of Tyrants, and calleth them Highwaymen.—The Taylor and the Satin Breeches.—The Shoemaker and the Shoes.—Peter lamenteth that there should be some who think it a Sin to resist Tyrants.— Adviseth them to read Æsop's Fables. Who, and what are ye, sceptred bullies?—speak, That millions to your will must bow the neck, And, ox-like, meanly take the galling yoke? Philosophers your ignorance despise; Ev'n Folly, laughing, lifts her maudlin eyes, And freely on your wisdoms cracks her joke. How dare ye on the men of labour tread, Whose honest toils supply your mouths with bread; Who, groaning, sweating, like so many hacks, Work you the very clothes upon your backs? Clothes of calamity, I fear, That hold in ev'ry stitch a tear. Who sent you?—Not the Lord who rules on high, Sent you to man on purpose from the sky, Because of wisdom it is not a proof: Show your credentials, sirs:—if ye refuse, Terrific gentlemen, our smiles excuse, Belief most certainly will keep aloof. Old virtuous rugged Cato, on a day, Thus to the Soothsayers was heard to say, ‘Augurs! by all the gods it is a shame, To gull the mole-ey'd million at this rate; Making of gaping blockheads such a game, Pretending to be hand and glove with Fate! ‘On guts and garbage when ye meet, To carry on the holy cheat, How is it ye preserve that solemn grace, Nor burst with laughter in each other's face?’ Thus to our courtiers, sirs, might I exclaim— ‘In Wonder's name, How can ye meanly grov'ling bow the head To pieces of gilt gingerbread? Fetch, carry, fawn, kneel, flatter, crawl, tell lies, To please the creature that ye should despise?’ Tyrants, with all your wonderful dominion, Ye ar'n't a whit like God, in my opinion; Though you think otherwise, I do presume: Hot to the marrow with the ruling lust, Fancying your crouching subjects so much dust, Your lofty selves the mighty sweeping broom. Open the warehouses of all your brains; Come, sirs, turn out—let's see what each contains: Heav'ns, how ridiculous! what motley stuff! Shut, quickly shut again the brazen doors; Too much of balderdash the eye explores; Yes, shut them, shut them, we have seen enough. Are these the beings to bestride a world? To such sad beasts, has God his creatures hurl'd? Men want not tyrants—overbearing knaves; Despots that rule a realm of slaves; Proud to be gaz'd at by a reptile race: Charm'd with the music of their clanking chains, Pleas'd with the fog of state that clouds their brains, Who cry, with all the impudence of face, ‘Behold your gods! down, rascals, on your knees! Your money, miscreants—quick, no words, no strife; Your lands too, scoundrels, vermin, lice, bugs, fleas; And thank our mercy that allows you life!’ Thus speak the highwaymen in purple pride, On Slavery's poor gall'd back so wont to ride. Who would not laugh to see a tailor bow Submissive to a pair of satin breeches? Saying, ‘O breeches, all men must allow There's something in your aspect that bewitches! ‘Let me admire you, breeches, crown'd with glory; And though I made you, let me still adore ye: Though a rump's humble servant, form'd for need, To keep it warm, yet, Lord! you are so fine, I cannot think you are my work indeed— Though merely mortal, lo! ye seem divine!’ Who would not quick exclaim, ‘The tailor's mad?’ Yet tyrant-adoration is as bad. See! Crispin makes a pair of handsome shoes, Silk and bespangled, such as ladies use— Suppose the shoes so proud, upon each heel, Perk it in Crispin's face, with saucy pride, And all the meanness of his trade deride, And all the state of self-importance feel: Tell him the distance between them and him, Crispin would quickly cry, ‘A pretty whim! Confound your little bodies, though so fine, Is not the silk and spangles that ye boast Put on you at my proper cost? Whatever's on ye, is it not all mine? Did not I put you thus together, pray?’ What could the simple shoes in answer say? There too are some (thank Heav'n they do not swarm) Who deem it foul to stay a tyrant's arm, That falls with fate upon their humble skulls: Some for a despot's rod have heav'd the sigh! Let such on wiser Æsop cast an eye, And read the fable of the Frogs, the fools. THE FROGS AND JUPITER. THE frogs so happy, 'midst their peaceful pond, Of emp'rors grew at once extremely fond; Yes, yes, an emp'ror was a glorious thing; Each really took it in his addle pate, 'Twould be so charming to exchange their state! An emp'ror would such heaps of blisses bring! Sudden out hopp'd the nation on the grass, Frog-man and yellow wife, and youth and lass, A numerous tribe, to knuckle down to Jove, And pray the gods to send an emp'ror down, 'Twas such a pretty thing, th' imperial crown! So form'd their pleasures, honours, to improve. Forth from his old blue weather-box, the skies, Jove briskly stepp'd, with two wide-wond'ring eyes: ‘Mynheers,’ quoth Jove, ‘if ye are wise, be quiet; Know when you're happy’—but he preach'd in vain; They made the most abominable riot; ‘An emp'ror, emp'ror, yes, we must obtain.’ ‘Well, take one,’ cry'd the god, and down he swopp'd A monstrous piece of wood, from whence he chopp'd Kings for the gentlefolks of ancient days: Stunn'd at the sound, the frogs all shook with dread; Like dabchicks, under water push'd each head, Afraid a single nose so pale to raise. At length one stole a peep, and then a second, Who, slily winking to a third frog, beckon'd; And so on, till they all obtain'd a peep; Now nearer, nearer edging on they drew, And finding nothing terrible, nor new, Bold on his majesty began to leap: Such hopping this way, that way, off and on! Such croaking, laughing, ridiculing, fun! In short, so very shameful were they grown; So much of grace and manners did they lack, One little villain saucily squat down, And, with a grin, defil'd the royal back. Now, unto Jove they, kneeling, pray'd again, ‘O Jupiter, this is so sad a beast, So dull a monarch—so devoid of brain! Give us a king of spirit, Jove, at least.’ The god comply'd, and sent them emp'ror Stork, Who with his loving subjects went to work; Chas'd the poor sprawling imps from pool to pool, Resolv'd to get a handsome belly full. Now gasping, wedg'd within his iron beak, Did wriggling scores most lamentably squeak: Bold push'd the emp'ror on, with stride so noble, Bolting A term to be found in the Hampshire Dictionary, implying a rapid deglutition of bacon, without the sober ceremony of mastication. It is, moreover, to be observed, that Hampshire servants, who are bacon-bolters, have always less wages than bacon-chewers. his subjects with majestic gobble. Again the noble croaking tribe began to pray, 'Midst hoppings, scramblings, murder, and dismay: ‘O save us, Jove, from this inhuman Turk! O save us from this imp of Hell!’ ‘Mynheers,’ quoth Jove, ‘pray keep your emp'ror Stork— Fools never know when they are well.’ ODE. [Emp'rors, and popes, and nabobs, mighty things] Peter giveth a gentle Trimming to the Jackets of foreign Potentates; and a Pair of pretty Fables, by way of Looking-glasses, for their Most High Haughtinesses. Emp'rors, and popes, and nabobs, mighty things, I think, too, we may take in foreign kings, Too often deem their humble makers, slaves; Now such high folk are either fools or knaves, Or both together probably—a case That happens frequently amongst the race. Methinks now, this is scandalous—'tis hateful— Wicked, and, what is full as bad, ungrateful. The great of many a continent and isle, Enough to make the sourest cynic smile, Or, as the proverb says, ‘make a dog laugh,’ Think honours from themselves arise alone; Thus are their makers at a distance thrown, Consider'd as mere mob, mere dirt, mere chaff. The following Fables then will let them know, What to us riffraff of the world they owe. THE DIAMOND PIN AND THE FARTHING CANDLE; A FABLE. UPON a lady's toilet, full of lustre, A di'mond pin one night began to bluster; Full of conceit, like some young flirting girl, Her senses lost in Vanity's wild whirl: Highly disgusted at a farthing candle, Left by the lady of the broom, Nam'd Susan, slipp'd into another room, Something of consequence to handle— ‘You nasty tallow thing,’ exclaim'd Miss Pin, ‘Pray keep your distance—don't stay here, and wink; I loathe ye—you and all your greasy kin— Good heav'ns! how horribly you look and stink!’ ‘Good Lord! Miss Pin,’ Miss Candle quick reply'd, ‘Soften a little that ungrateful pride: You shine indeed—to this I must agree: Yes, Miss, you make a very pretty blaze; But let me tell ye, that your wondrous rays Owe all their boasted brilliancy to me.’ ‘How! Madam Impudence!’ rejoin'd Miss Pin, First with a frown, and then a scornful grin; ‘I should not, sure, have dreamt of that, Miss Fat!’ ‘Susan,’ Miss Candle bawl'd, ‘Susan, come here! Such saucy language I'll no longer bear: Susan, come, satisfy the lady's doubt— Take me away, I say, or blow me out.’ Susan, who, list'ning, heard the great dispute, By no means could refuse Miss Candle's suit; So into darkness Susan blew her beam: ‘Now,’ with a sharp sarcastic sneer, ‘Now,’ quoth Miss Candle, ‘now, my dear, Where is of radiance now your boasted stream? ‘Where are your keen and fascinating rays, Ten thousand of them—such a mighty blaze?’ Miss Di'mond star'd, and star'd, and star'd again, To find departed radiance, but in vain. Quite vanish'd! not a single ray display'd! Each sparkle swallow'd in the depth of shade! Alter'd, quite alter'd, sadly disappointed, The bones of her high pride disjointed, ‘I fear,’ quoth Pin, ‘I much mistake my nature.’ ‘True,’ answer'd Candle, ‘true, my dear Miss Pin; Lift not, in future, quite so high your chin, But show some rev'rence for your blaze-creator.’ THE SUN AND THE PEACOCK; A FABLE. A PEACOCK, mounted on a barn one day, Blest with a quantum sufficit of pride, All consequence amid the solar ray, Spread with a strut his circling plumage wide. ‘Good morrow,’ quoth the coxcomb, ‘Master Sun; Your brassy face has greatly been admir'd— Now pray, Sol, answer me—I'm not in fun— What is there in it to be so desir'd? If I have any eyes to see, And, that I have, is clear to me, My tail possesses far more splendid grace, By far more beauty than your worship's face.’ The sun look'd down with smiles upon the fowl, Supposing it at first an owl: And thus with gravity reply'd, ‘Sir, know, That though unluckily my worship's face Seems far beneath your tail in splendid grace, Still to my face that glitt'ring tail you owe.’ ‘Poh!’ quoth the peacock, ‘Master Sun, Your highness loves a bit of fun.’ ‘I beg your pardon,’ answer'd Sol again— ‘And, if you please, I'll condescend to show How much to me you ev'ry moment owe The boasted beauties of your waving train.’ ‘Agreed, with all my soul,’ the bird reply'd, In all the full-blown insolence of pride; ‘To credit such a tale I'm not the noddy: Prove that the glorious plumage I display Owes all its happy colours to thy ray, D?m'me I'll tear my feathers from my body.’ The challeng'd Sun in clouds withdrew His flaming beams from ev'ry view, And o'er the world a depth of darkness spread: The bats their churches left, to wing the air; The cocks and hens and cows began to stare, And sulky went all supperless to bed; For not an almanack had op'd its lips About so very wondrous an eclipse. The Peacock too, amongst the rest Of marv'ling fowl and staring beast, Turn'd to his feathers with some doubt, Amaz'd to find his hundred eyes put out; Indeed all nature did appear as black As if old Sol had popp'd into a sack. Pleas'd with his triumph, from a cloud, The Sun, still hiding, call'd aloud, ‘Well! can ye merit to my face allow? What's now your colour? where your hundred eyes? The mingled radiance of a thousand dies; Speak, Master Peacock, what's your colour now?’ ‘What colour!’ quoth the bird, as much asham'd As courtiers high by loss of office tam'd— ‘To own the truth, much-injur'd Phœbus, know, I'm not one atom better than a crow. I see my folly—pity my poor train; And let thy goodness bid it shine again.’ Tyrants of eastern realms, whose subjects' noses, Like a smith's vice, your iron pow'r encloses; Who treat your people just like dogs or swine; The meaning of my tale, can ye divine? If not, go try to find it, I beseech ye, And do not let your angry subjects teach ye. END OF VOL. II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. CELEBRATION; OR, THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION TO ST. JAMES'S. AN ODE. Rare band! whom wide-mouth'd mob with shouts shall hail: West at the head, and Wilton at the tail! CONTENTS. Peter, after the Manner of Parsons, prayeth for good Weather.—He beggeth Morning to smile on the Meat and Drink, and the cavalcading Members of the Royal Academy.—Peter upbraideth Mister Wilton for guzzling Porter with low People below, when he should be above, amongst the Antiques.—The Cavalcade described.—It arriveth at St. James's.—The Members tremble.—They appear before their Sovereign.—They fall on their Faces.—They get up again.—The President receives the Honour of Knighthood.—He feeleth himself metamorphosed into a sublimer Creature. A most original, beautiful, and striking Comparison between Mister West's new State and that of a Butterfly.—Peter wondereth at the great Power of a Sword and a Word, and wisheth they could improve the literary Abilities of Mr. West. —The Members kiss hands; who, Peter thinketh, would gladly kiss any other Part than no Part of Majesty. Sol, put thee on thy best gold wig to-day; Let rude December be the gentle May; Chain'd be the tempests, and well bung'd the rain; Nor let a fog his sullen twilight spread, As lately dark'ning bade us think the head Of some high-titled man was cleft in twain. Yes, yes, let Morn look down with smiling pride, And smile on roast, and boil'd, and bak'd, and fry'd, And grill'd, and devil'd, gums of Genius greeting; Smile too upon the academic men, Respectables indeed! who, nine in ten, Well as of painting, know the art of eating. Smile too on the procession—grateful throng, That glorious through the Strand shall move along, And at St. James's give th' address of honey; Full of rich loyalty and candied praise, For royal favours that a world amaze! Viz. pictures, statues, drawings, books, and money. Rare band! whom wide-mouth'd Mob with shouts shall hail; West at the head, and Wilton at the tail. Yet let not Wilton join the glorious rear; No, let not Wilton in the band appear; Wilton, who, lazy beer-admiring master, For Whitbread, quits his pupils and their plaster; Deserts, for common serving-men, the room, And hobs or nobs with ladies of the broom: Preferring thus black Charles's A servant of the R. Academy. Æthiop face To Belvidere Apollo's head and grace; O fie! 'midst vulgar porter-pots regaling; Who leav'st great Hercules for poor grey John An old servant also of the R. Academy., And, what must shock the feelings of a stone, The youthful Venus for old Mother Maling A servant likewise of the R. Academy.. See! from yon dome, amid th' expectant throng, Slow moves the tribe of Benjamin along, While Fame before them with her trumpet flies; Whilst on their heads, from bulks and chimney-tops As thick as herrings or as thick as hops, Wild Admiration casts her countless eyes. And now they reach the gate of Adoration! And now a very sudden palpitation Amid the fibres of their hearts they feel! And now of royalty th' electric shock, Just as a man upon the black-brow'd rock Has oft experienc'd from the numbing eel The torpedo.. And now they panting mount St. James's stairs, In goodly order and in goodly pairs; Now at the hall of audience they arrive; Now 'midst the blaze of majesty they fall Prone on their faces, like affrighted Paul, Half dead, alas! poor saint! and half alive. See them, like nine-pins tumbled on the plain! And now they get upon their ends again!— Behold grave Benjamin th' address present! Now on his knees (his soul's first wish!) delighted, Behold once-quaker Benjamin be-knighted, Amidst a moon-ey'd host of wonderment! Now on his shoulder drops the magic sword: ‘Arise Sir Benjamin!’ the sovereign says— Happy, the knight ariseth at the word, And feels himself o'erwhelm'd with glory's rays. In bolder streams his blood begins to flow; His heart sublime, a richer torrent pours; He looks contemptuous on the mob below, And, swelling, now a pyramid he tow'rs. With lords behold him talk—with ladies chat Of sceptres, snuff, rebellions, and all that. Thus from his humble shop the silken worm That crawl'd at first the earth, to man's surprise, Bursts forth with splendor—what an angel form! And mounts on glittering wings of gold the skies; Talks to this mealy lord, and now that fair, So happy mingling with the tribes of air! Ah! dwelleth such rare virtue in a sword? Ah! lodgeth such huge magic in a word? Good heav'ns! what pity for th' unletter'd knight, They cannot teach to speak and read and write! And now they humbly all kiss hands so sweet; How blest the hand of majesty to greet! For which, miles high would thousands gladly jump: And would but sacred majesty permit, Such really is Ambition's raging fit, (Unlike Rabelais the rogue The story of Rabelais running from the pope's presence is too well known to be repeated.) they'd kiss the rump! Now cloth'd with honour, see the troop retreat! Now majesty's good health they drink and eat! Now, maudlin majesty's good health disgorge! Now on poor kingless France they run their rigs! Now mad for majesty they burn their wigs! Now, loyal, fry their watches This farce was actually performed during the late reign, in the full form of loyalty, by the mayor and aldermen of a certain corporation in a western county. for King George! HAIR POWDER; A PLAINTIVE EPISTLE TO MR. PITT. Yet, if resolv'd to worry wigs and hair, And, Herod-like, not little children spare; Say (for methinks the land has much to dread) How long in safety may we wear the head? CHAPTER OF CONTENTS. A sublime Exordium, containing a great Compliment to Mr. Pitt.—The Poet sagely adviseth the Minister—observeth to him the Effect of Time on the Heads of Beaux and old Maids.—The hard Fate of poor carotty-polled Phillis.—Lubin's and Hodge's Disappointment, by Means of this cruel Tax.—A great and œconomical Judge's Mortification; and Exultation of his Fur-clad Brother at the Tax on Hair Powder.—A melancholy Picture of the Hair-dressers and Barbers. The Poet's eye (as Shakespeare sayeth), ‘in a fine phrensy rolling,’ beholdeth the Chase of a powdered Poll; the Capture; the Redemption; and Punishment of the Informers in London— also Poll-chases in the Country, illustrated by an apt Simile.—Peter exclaimeth at the Minister, and compareth him to a hard-hearted Fellow that lived upon Executions.—Peter praiseth Mr. Pitt's Powers of Oratory.—He attacketh the Pride of the Minister; wishing him to take a little Retrospect of humble Days.—A Kite and beautiful Bat-comparison.—Another charming Comparison of the Boy and his Trunk.—Peter telleth strange and unbelievable Things, and giveth two most gracious Speeches.—Peter praiseth the two Speeches, and giveth alarming Advice. —He exhibiteth a Part of his political Creed. —Peter showeth his profound Knowledge of Emperors and Kings and Queens, &amp;c. and maketh shrewd Observations thereon; concluding with a Compliment to Mr. Fox.—Peter prayeth fervently for the Royal Family.—The Poet suspecteth the Effect of the Minister's Eloquence.—Peter prayeth to Mr. Pitt.—England wittily and properly christened an old Cow; also America.— The Poet asketh a pertinent Question relative to royal Exemption from the Tax, and administereth laudable Counsel.—Peter gravely and ingeniously pointeth out a Tax on Christian Skins; also some (not all indeed) of the great Advantages of human Hides in the Way of Trade.— The convertible Use of Mr. Justice Buller's tender Hide; of the Duke of Gloucester's; of the Duchess of Cumberland's; of Lord Brudenell's (the Lord help him!); of the Duke of Richmond's, &amp;c.—The Poet asketh where the Powder Tax was born, and, like a certain great Man, answereth the Question himself.—The Poet telleth the Minister a sorrowful Tale.—A stinking, yet beautiful Simile.—Peter prophesieth.—Serious and good Advice to Mr. Pitt.—Political and deep Reflections.—Peter seeth a Vision full of Horror. —He affecteth a Smile, but it seemeth to be rather the Risus Sardonicus.—Peter counselleth (but, he thinketh, in vain) the Minister and his Colleague Harry Dundas to run the Gantlet.— The Conclusion. O mighty master of the ways and means To slake the golden thirst of kings and queens; To gorge the cavern of each greedy chest With all the wonders of the bleeding east; To lull with opiate draughts a kingdom's groans, Patch ragged crowns, and cobble crazy thrones; The modest bard, for five short minutes, bear; Nor may the Muse's wisdom wound thine ear! Sick of thy taxes, while the wearied nation Drags her last penny forth, and fears starvation; Whose voice is loud, and daily waxing louder; List to the serious sound, and damn the powder. To thee, responsible for ev'ry blunder, Her mildest murmurs should be claps of thunder. Pleas'd with thy fav'rite folly, mark old time, Wide-grinning at the beau beyond his prime; And many a maid, beyond life's blooming day, Whose curls his wonted malice turn'd to grey! Lo, the poor girl, whom carrot-colour shocks, Pines pennyless, and blushes for her locks! Refus'd to fly to powder's friendly aid, She bids them seek in caps the secret shade; No ringlets now around her neck to wave, Phillis must hide the redd'ning shame, or shave! At thee she flings her curses, Pitt, and cries— At thee she darts the lightnings of her eyes; And thinks that Love ne'er warm'd him who could vex, With wanton strokes of cruelty, the sex. On Sundays trim, to give his head an air, Poor Lubin shook the dredge box o'er his hair; Hodge dipp'd his caxon 'mid the sack of flour: But now they execrate the arm of pow'r; Lubin no longer dares the dredge-box shake, Nor Hodge to dip his caxon in the sack. Yet see a nobler mourner! K?, lo! The saving judge has felt a stunning blow: His hawk-œconomy won't thank thee for't, Which stops his pretty nipperkin of port Such is the laudable moderation of this second Sir John Cutler, or Mr. Elwes, that he allows himself and lady at and after dinner no more than this little measure of wine! A fine example for the sons of dissipation! It has been supposed that the œconomical Judge has surpassed the famous miracle of the loaves and fishes, by making one bottle of wine serve for double the number of souls, or rather bodies, that have come with open mouths to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. I do not think they have gone away so well satisfied.. Not so Judge Blood, who glories in deceit; His life one murder, and his soul a cheat— He loves a law, and hugs the man who made it, To hang a culprit and himself evade it. See groups of hair-dressers all idle stand, A melancholy, mute, and mournful band; And barbers eke, who lift the crape-clad pole, And round and round their eyes of horror roll; Desponding, pale, like Hosier's ghost so white, Who told their sorrows 'mid the moony light. But see! each hopeless wight with fury foams; His curling-irons breaks, and snaps his combs; Ah! doom'd to shut their mouths as well as shops; For dead is custom, 'mid the world of crops Such is the univeral disgust at the powder-tax, that many thousands of the male sex have already sacrificed their favourite curls, to disappoint the rapacity of a minister.. In fancy now I mark the frequent race; I see th' informer polls of powder chase! On this, on that, a footman, maid of mop, Fierce as the tiger from his ambush, pop; Now if his cruel clutches, sharp and strong, To Bow-street drag his powder'd prey along: And now I see the mob in mercy's cause, Redeem the victim from his savage paws; And now the tyrant to a horse-pond draw, To quench the red-hot thunder-bolt of law. Amidst our villages, in fancy's eye, I see informers chase, and culprits fly— Rude pikes so hungry, putting to the rout, Voracious darting, a poor host of trout. Who would not hide the temple's white and grey? ‘Your money, sirs—remove the mask, or pay,’ Is now thy language to a groaning nation! Pitt, Pitt, thou hast no bowels of compassion. How mean (for money such thy boundless rage) Thus to expose the cruel pow'r of age! Much like the man art thou, and hard as he, Who let his scaffold out at Tyburn tree; Where, as the great and pious Doctor Dodd Gave by a rope his sinful soul to God, Thus on his boards aloft, amid the crowd, Th' unfeeling wretch of wretches bawl'd aloud, (So anxious people's pockets to be picking) ‘Up, up—who mounts here?—all alive, and kicking.’ I grant thine eloquence's happy flow; But Truth should bear it company, I trow— Hypocrisy, the knave, to keep his place, Too often borrows Virtue's honest face. I know thy pride vaults high—but what of that? The tow'ring column often rais'd a rat. Though toss'd aloft by stone-blind Fortune's pow'r, Awake thy mem'ry to thy humbler hour: Though now a kite—ah! once a bat, how small! Flick'ring around for flies in yonder hall Westminster-Hall.! But, drunk with honours, ‘No,’ thou criest, ‘no; I thank thee, but I cannot look so low.’ Thus a poor country boy to India goes; A small portmanteau all the wealth he knows; Arrives, with awkward legs and arm and mien; But, ere a twelvemonth pass, how chang'd the scene! He mounts his elephant, treats, wh?s, gets drunk, And, ah! forgets his friend the little trunk. Know, man, no more of taxes now we want; Lo, generous m?y prepar'd to grant. Hark to a voice divine!—‘Pitt, Pitt, hæ, Pitt; ‘No more, no more for taxes whet thy wit; I'll pay, I'll pay the soldier and the tar— My millions, Pitt, shall pay the glorious war; I'll give sheep, lamb, ram, turkey, duck, boar, sow, Goose, gosling, cock, hen, heifer, bull, calf, cow; And, Pitt, hæ, hæ at Smithfield Pitt, I shine— Mine's the best beef—yes, mine—what, what?—yes, mine: I'll empty every guinea-chest, and sack; Yes, yes, the people ought to have it back: My money in the stocks, my wood Here I must candidly condemn a part of the people, whose cause, in the affair of hair-powder, I am so pathetically pleading. ‘Such (says the Windsor Chronicle) was the unparalleled effrontery of the inhabitants of Brentford, during the late unexampled frost, when they should have thought of nothing but dying, that those very people, not worth a groat, starving, shivering, and in rags, dared to proceed in a body, amidst the dead silence of the night, with their unhallowed feet, into the sacred gardens of Richmond and Kew; where they wickedly, inhumanly, and feloniously, cut down and maimed a number of trees, many of which they had the impudence to carry away to their own scrub chimneys, to warm their own vile bones, because, forsooth, certain great people happened fortunately to be in possession of enormous quantities of wood, during the great scarcity, and chose not to give it away in idle charity, nor sell it at the then current price, which had every probability of mounting higher: as though they had not an equal right to turn a penny in an honest way, with any coal-shed man in the village of Brentford. But behold how they behaved on this insulting, provoking, stealing, and trying occasion! So far from advertising handsome rewards for discovering the rogues, and bringing them to justice; such was their clemency, that they ordered the affair to be hushed up, and buried in perpetual oblivion!!!’, my hay; Yes, yes, I'll give my all, my all away; Yes, yes, I know, I know the hounds are howling— God, Pitt, I don't, I don't much like their growling: Hæ, hæ, growl, growl—what, what? things don't go right; Why quickly, quickly, Pitt, the dogs may bite— That would be bad, bad, bad,—a sad mishap— Hæ, Pitt—hæ, hæ? I should not like a snap.’ Such are the sounds to stun those ears of thine Where truth and speed and oratory shine. And hark, another voice! and thus it cries: ‘I geef my chewells to de peepel's sighs— All tings from Mistress Hastings as I gote; I geef de fine pig di'mond of Arcote The famous diamond, so infamously obtained by Mr. R.; constituting a curious piece of Asiatic history.; Iss, dat vich Rhumbold geef, I geef again, Rader dan see de peeples suffer pain. De emp'ror presents, Lord! I vil not tush, Although de duty coss so very mush I am really afraid to touch upon this ticklish topic. The late procession of imperial presents from the India-House to ? was attended by a dirty Custom-House-officer; but for what reason the L? of the T? can best explain. It has been rumoured, and believed, that a small order from a certain quarter can overpower an act of Parliament; which, if true, maketh a second edition of little David knocking down the great Giant of Gath.. I turn off Mister Wyat The Architect., dat I sal; And geef up Frogmore—Iss, I geef up all; Geef up mine di'mond stomacher indeed; All, all, mush rader dan de peepels bleed: Iss, iss, I geef up all, shust like de k?, For bankrup nation be quite deflish ting. Vat signifies de millions Notwithstanding her m?'s immense property, in one thing and another, she possesses the most œconomical circumspection: witness the following pretty tale.— A Miss J?n?r, of Gloucestershire, with her mother, viewing the Palace of St. James's, and entering her M?'s dressing-room, where a cushion full of pins lay on her toilette, the young lady expressed a strong desire for having one of the q?'s pins to carry into the country, and was reaching out her hand to take one; when the attendant, struck with a sudden horror, caught her arm, and told her it was impossible to be granted, as her M? would certainly find it out.— ‘D'ye think I might change a pin?’ sighed the young lady, with anxiety. ‘Miss,’ replied the attendant, after some consideration, ‘it is probable her M? may not find that out, but I'll run the risk.’ in our purses, If money do profoke de peepels curses? We won't haf tumult—no sush ting muss spread— Mine Gote! half loaf be better dan no bread. Peety to make de Englis peepels groan; So goote as poote de prences 'pon de trone; Who soon, mine Gote! may take it in der brain, Vat dey poote up, dey may pull down again.’ What sounds of wisdom, Pitt, to make thee shrink! Beware!—thou stand'st on danger's giddy brink: Know, that a single grain, or half grain more, May turn the balance, man, and heave thee o'er: And shouldst thou tumble down the rock of fate, No seas of tears will wail thy shorten'd date. Go, copy the good pair whom all adore, Who spurn the proud Parcere sub jectis et debellare superbos., and hug the humble poor. Though from my soul I hate mad dissipation, That beggars and insults a generous nation; Too from my soul the avarice I hate, That, thirsty, squeezes like a spunge the state: Wishing from trees (so keen the gold it grapples) To shake down guineas just like pears and apples. Think not I court a tumult's lawless hour, And wish a mob's wild arm the sword of pow'r: No! let a Titus, let an Alfred rule; Who sighs not for a king, I deem a fool. Like those were Europe's monarchs! in thy ear, What from a people had such forms to fear? Safe 'mid the ardour of a realm's embrace! Kings never fall but by their own disgrace. I murmur not at kings, if good for aught; I only quarrel when they're good for nought. 'Tis whisper'd that I never reverenc'd thrones: Granted—I never worship stocks nor stones; Nor look I for wise emp'rors, nor wise kings— 'Tis expectation's madness—Quixote things. The man to titles, and to riches born, Amid the world of science, how forlorn! To speak to think, unable, mark his air! Heav'ns! what an idiot gape, and idiot stare? Though lord of millions, gilt with titles o'er— A statue 'midst a library!—no more! He deems the butterflies of folly, treasure; And shuns chaste Wisdom, for the strumpet Pleasure. 'Tis true, gay Pleasure courts us to the joy, While Wisdom to her swains is always coy. The brain must labour, or it proves the sport Of Wisdom's circle, though it charm a court. Seek we corporeal strength? the mine, the plough, Of strong examples, furnish us enow. Search we the spot which mental power contains? Go where man gets his living by his brains. Had Charles Mr. Fox. first popp'd into the world I ween, That world a very diff'rent Charles had seen. ‘What had Charles been?’ is ask'd with wonder—even That good, fat, honest, sleepy fellow—Stephen The late Lord Holland, elder brother of Mr. Fox. O may of princes a long race succeed! Such doves, such harmless doves as now we feed; Not eagles, screaming with insatiate maw, Wild in our hearts to plunge the beak and claw? And yet too oft, to damn the coward age, Our isle has trembled at a tyrant's rage. Thus 'mid the smiles of Nature's fair domain, Where blooming Health and Plenty lead their train; Where, rob'd with verdure, wind the rills along, And ev'ry vale resounds with cheerful song; See o'er th' Elysian scene, with lofty head, The blood-stain'd gibbet In France, Switzerland, &amp;c. are many of these pretty monuments of pride. dash the soul with dread! I own thy eloquence's stream, but know, Too oft for England's welfare periods flow: A truce to all such metaphoric breath: So soft, they drop into our ears with death. How like the snows, wide-ermining the air, So gently sinking, kissing, all so fair; Falling on simple sheep, and soon, alas! O'erwhelming, killing, with the courteous mass. Mercy to England yield, the poor lean cow! Thy busy fingers have forc'd milk enow: Though frequent rushing the lank teats to teaze, How patiently the beast has borne thy squeeze! Just shak'd her head, and wincing whisk'd her tail, When oft thou fill'dst a puncheon for a pail: But now she bushing roars, and makes a pudder, Afraid thy harden'd hands may steal her udder. Think on America, our cow of yore, Which oft the hand with Job-like patience bore; Who, pinch'd, and yet denied a lock of hay, Kick'd the hard milkman off, and march'd away. In vain he try'd by ev'ry art to catch her; To wound, to hamstring, nay, knock down, dispatch her; Far off she kept, where Love, where Freedom rules, Mocking the fruitless rage of rogues and fools. Speak Pitt (for know at times I'm rather dull) Why from thy tax exempt a royal skull? Why free each creeping thing about a court? The grumbling nation will not thank thee for't. Let Hawk'sb'ry frown, and bull-face Brudenell roar; They well may club, to ease the nation's score: Their purse-strings, nay, let all thy colleagues draw, Disgorging a poor guinea from each maw. Let Queensb'ry nobly pinch his Cyprian sinnings, And stately Cumberland As one of the great supporters of morality, for such every muse should be, I have several times had it in contemplation to give this dame a public rap on the knuckles for certain parsimony to some of the poor disbanded and faithful servants of her household, after the death of her simple duke. The tale however is too full of matter for a solitary note, and may, some time or other, give importance to an ode. her faro winnings; Let Madam S?g This great lady kept one of the first sale-shops in England. make up wry faces, Something should come in troth from sales of places. Say, what the tax thy brain will next provide? Alas! why not attack the human hide? Lord, Lord! how much it must the nation aid! Folks may be scalp'd with safety—why not flay'd? 'Tis verily a shame—a crying sin, The world should bear about a useless skin; What's worse, that skins should in the grave be laid, So beautiful an article of trade. Think of the spatterdashes, boots and shoes; And think thou of the millions people use: Such, form'd from human hides, would brave the weather, And save such quantities of foreign leather. Thus would our Britain annual thousands gain, And rival all the cows and calves of Spain. Ask'st thou what other use our hides could boast? Books may be bound, my friend—the letter'd host: Cases of conscience, Buller's skin should bind; Good folios upon mercy to mankind: Glo'ster's, a book on wedlock's sweet tranquillity; His sister Cumberland's, upon humility: Brudenell's, on beauty, witty conversation, On manners, music, ratiocination: Hawk'sb'ry, on fair, disinterested deeds: Essays on manliness, the skin of Leeds: Richmond's on courage; modesty, Dundas's; State-sycophants, a volume upon asses: The ?'s, on elocution, hay and hogs, Corn, politics, tithes, civil-list, and logs: The ?'s, on di'monds, pearls, and custom-dues, Old gowns, old petticoats, old hose, old shoes; Good nature, state-extravagancy-lopping, Pins, mantua-makers, milliners, and shopping: To close th' illustrious list, and sounding line, On delegates, reform, and powder, thine. O say, where first was plann'd thy powder scheme? At Wimbledon arose the golden dream; Where thou, and honest Rumbold-hunting Harry, Project, and re-project, and oft miscarry? Two graziers, cheap'ning hogs to fill your styes; Two spiders, weaving lines for simple flies. Rich spot! whence millions take their easy wing, To bribe an emp'ror, and refresh a king His most honourable majesty, our late good and firm ally, the King of Prussia, like the gentlemen of the bar, requires very often a refresher before his cannon can plead.; Where, blest, ye bumper it in England's cause, Belch Opposition's fall, and hiccup laws; With equal spirit, where each work succeeds, A bottle now, and now a nation bleeds. Ah, Pitt! of late thy counsels draw disgrace: The spring-tide of thy fortune ebbs apace. When reputation sickens, toil is vain— No nostrum gives the bloom of health again! No more (so grateful to the sense) To avoid an ambiguity here (for I have been questioned about it), I mean the sweet-smelling rose of the fields, not Mr. George Rose, of the Treasury. a rose, It drops, a putrid carcass, to the crows. I mark the pompous column of thy fame, Fast crumbling to the dust from whence it came; And see thy thund'ring day in silence close, While Wisdom triumphs o'er the pale repose. Too much thou courtest Danger's dizzy height; The treach'rous sands may sink beneath thy feet— Thy kite, that reeling, shifting, mounts the storm, May force Heav'n's flash upon thy feeble form! Think not I wish with Satire's blade to play, And, charm'd with man's disgraces, selfish say, ‘Let folly root in ministers and kings— While rank and thick like aconite it springs, Delighted on the precious load I look, And hail a harvest for the muse's hook.’ Still to be serious, Pitt, before we part: Let Mercy melt the mill-stone of thy heart I principally allude in this place to the political character of this statesman, which is rather marked with severity. As for the domestic, it possesses some traits belonging to the Jolly God. Even Parliament last year saw him enter the walls of St. Stephen, arm in arm with his dear colleague and constant companion honest Harry Dundas; both fortunately conducted to the Treasury Bench without a fall, by the boozing reeling deity, where ‘Palinurus nodded at the helm.’. How nobler far, for honest fame to toil, And change a kingdom's curses for a smile! Yet, if resolv'd to worry wigs and hair, And, Herod-like, not little children spare, Say (for methinks the land has much to dread) How long in safety may we wear the head? Enough our necks have bow'd beneath the yoke; Enough our sides have felt the goad and stroke; Then cease to make, by further irritation, Our patience the sole rock of thy salvation. Of late hath Glory quarrell'd with thy fame; Poor Public Credit founder'd!—lame, quite lame— Rapacity too oft extends her jaw, Fresh whets her fang, and points her iron claw! The arm of Vengeance drops not lightly down; Not quite a feather on a culprit's crown— Profusion vilely foster'd—Honour dead; Resentment's eye looks dangerously red. Believe me, Pitt, not yet is thine the realm, Not thine the ship, because thou hold'st the helm: Such is the voice of Truth!—perhaps it wounds— Friend to thyself and England, heed the sounds; Sounds to alarm—and let not, though severe, The breath of Folly brush them from thine ear. Vain is rough bluster—vainly dar'st thou say, ‘Poh! danger At the Old Bailey lately, in the affair of Mr. Horne Tooke, on the subject of delegation, when Mr. Memory Middleton was beat hollow by the prime minister.! I have met its trying day’— For, ah! too often, boastful of his wars, Rank Cowardice assumes the mien of Mars. Dim though thy beam, the muse's eagle eye Beholds a tempest in the distant sky; Dull though thy tympanum, her nicer ear Catches a thunder-growl from yonder sphere; She sees sharp Fate amid the gathering gloom; A cloud of vengeance, black with mortal doom; But dares not name the melancholy form, Whom Guilt has mark'd the victim of the storm. Now to be gay again—should Famine rise, The meagre spectre, on a S?'s eyes, And should the groan of Britain's bleeding wound Press on the shrinking ear—a killing sound; Be whistles blown, and bells of children rung; The fav'rite little farthing rush-light sung; Let dancing-dogs, delighting, form their ball, Whips crash, and grinding hurdy-gurdies squall; While crown'd with chimney-sweepers on their way, In deep-ton'd unisons the asses bray; Such as at Frogmore A villa near Windsor, belonging to the queen., form'd to please a pair, The true sublime of monarchs, a Dutch fair! And as again, on Frogmore's happy green, More shows shall gladden our good king and queen This is absolutely determined on, in the Frogmore senate.; Suppose Dundas and thou (a princely sport) Play some farce character to charm the court, And boldly run the gauntlope through a mob, That execrates, that damns the powder job; Where barbers, hair-dressers, perfumers, throng, To hoot and hustle as ye course along; Dash with their powder-bags your brains about, With many a kick, and scoff, and grunt, and shout; Each face with tallow and with dripping smear; And with hot pincers tweak each nose and ear! Lo! should it miss the royal approbation, I'll answer for the plaudit of the nation. Such is the song—and do not thou, severe, With treason, treason, fill a royal ear. A gentle joke, at times, on queens and kings, Are pleasant, taking, nay, instructive things: Yet some there are, who relish not the sport, That flutter in the sunshine of a court; Who, fearful song might mar their high ambition, Loose the gaunt dogs of state, and bawl ‘Sedition!’ FROGMORE FETE; AN ODE FOR MUSIC The reader will, at the first glance, perceive a resemblance between my ode, and the celebrated ode for St. Cecilia's Day by Dryden, and know perhaps to which he must yield the preference. In spite of all the praises bestowed on Alexander's Feast, I dare pronounce it, a downright drunken Bartholomew-Fair scene; the poetry too, not superior to the subject: whereas the Frogmore Gala was of the order of sublimity; and as for the merits of my muse on the glorious occasion (though indeed I could say a great deal in her favour) my good old friend, the public, must decide., For the first of April, vulgarly called All Fools Day. ‘? Trahit sua quemque voluptas.’ ‘In various things (says Virgil) folks delight;’ And so it really is in our great nation! In meanness, avarice, some—revenge and spite, Dutch fairs, mock charities, and ostentation. 'Twas at the royal seat ‘'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won.’ DRYDEN. on Frogmore Green, With Britain's gold, uprear'd by Britain's queen; To charm a court, a princess The Princess Elizabeth. turn'd her head; At length deliver'd was her lovely brain, And, lo! on Frogmore's happy happy plain, Wonders on wonders soon were brought to bed. Sublime the pair of England sate! Staring with most enormous state, The family of Orange by their side; With all the pretty offspring round, That struck the mob with awe profound; Sweet state, untainted by one grain of pride! And bold beside them sat each valiant peer ‘His valiant peers were plac'd around.’ DRYDEN. To the ignorant in punctuation, this passage may seem degrading; as though the poet meant Messrs. Carpmeal, Macmanus, Townsend, and Jealous, as a part of the peers; whereas no such idea was intended. I nevertheless entertain a high respect for those gentlemen, as very useful members of society; yet cannot place them so high—it is so astonishing a leap from Bow-street.; Carpmeal, and courtly Chesterfield, were there; Macmanus, star-clad Sal'sb'ry, Townsend, Jealous, The guards of England's sovereigns—furious fellows: With combs, puffs, powder-bags, their temples bound; In golden letters, Guinea pigs, around. ‘Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound.’ DRYDEN. ‘Kings love mean company,’ quoth Edmund Burke— Making indeed with royal taste short work: But thus kings honour and exalt the low! How like the god that gives the golden day; Who through a little hole can dart his ray, And bid the dungeon with his radiance glow; Nay, from its filth too, bid a vapour rise Witness Lord H?y, Lord A?d, Mr. G. R?se, Mrs. H?, &amp;c. whose origins may be traced (as Mr. Burke emphatically expressed himself on a particular occasion) ‘to the swinish multitude.’, And make it a gay cloud amid the skies! But Pitt and Grenville were not there, To whom a puppet-show is dear— Too small decorum Not a single card of invitation was sent from Windsor or Carletonhouse. Violent were the r?l displeasures in the beginning; but the poet, in the true spirit of Christianity, hopes that he shall not be able to say, like the Liturgy, ‘As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.’ on a certain debt, Repell'd the pair from royal sport, Whose want of manners put the court, Like sour small beer, indeed, upon the fret. No, no—the cousins were not ask'd indeed! Broad hints, though giv'n, by no means could succeed; Nought could prevail, alas! nor tears, nor sighs! The zephyr, that scarce moves the lily's head, As soon might lift Old Ocean from his bed, And dash his wild of waters to the skies. Saunt'ring Saint James's Park were seen the pair, While bustling Frogmore triumph'd in her fair. And now to charm our gracious queen and king, Ascending on a public stage, The tuneful wonder of the age, Hight Incledon, began with bows to sing. Of war he chanted—glorious war; Of millions, millions, sent afar, To aid of falling monarchy the cause; When, lo! the lofty great all smil'd applause. Now to the happy, simp'ring, courtly crowd, In melting melody he sung aloud, A list of ev'ry Hanoverian hide; Skins of those mighty men, by bullets bor'd, Worth thirty pounds a-piece to their high lord, For whose great glory and defence they died. Dear is Hanoverian-skinning ‘War, he sung, is toil and trouble; Honour but an empty bubble; Never ending, still beginning, Fighting still, and still destroying: If the world be worth thy winning, Think, O think it worth enjoying.’ DRYDEN.! Money well is worth the winning— Fighting still, and still destroying; Hide-money is worth enjoying: Cutting, killing, drowning, starving; Soldiers' skins are well worth carving. And now the sweet Timotheus sang the fair, A la Chinoise, that brought such crowds to stare; And bear the trumpery of the booths away Booths were formed, and filled with the trinkets of the Windsor shops; purchased by somebody or other of the inhabitants of Windsor at prime cost, and sold at Frogmore at about one thousand pounds per cent. Large quantities were retailed on the occasion: for who could withstand the temptation of carrying off a bit of majesty, which would crown the possessor with eternal glory, and support a charity?: And then to charity he pour'd the strain— How folk a deal by charity may gain, And thus, with int'rest fair, themselves repay! And then he prais'd the great man and his dame, From whose deep heads the scheme so cunning came. And now he chose a plaintive strain— The embassy across the main, Of poor Macartney, and sad Staunton, knight; Forc'd, forc'd to enter, cheek by jowl, With hogs, dogs, jack-asses, Jehol— The sad procession!—a tumultuous sight! A lord and knight, disgrac'd, and tir'd, and fretting, Amidst the dusty hurlyburly sweating— Ah embassy! to which we may compare A drove of oxen sent to Smithfield fair. The pinions of importance pluck'd, Thrice to the earth their heads they duck'd; And thrice did they with blushes rise, With not a friend to close their eyes ‘On the bare earth expos'd he lies, With not a friend to close his eyes.’ DRYDEN. To this degrading ceremony of prostration before his Chinese majesty, it is said, our embassy submitted. But how could it be helped? Every thing, to be sure, that could be devised for the honour and glory of Great Britain, was attempted by Ambassador and Co.; but beggars must not be choosers.. Thus suffer'd British majesty disgrace, So well supported by the B?k race! At this the court of Frogmore sigh'd— And now he sang of more and worse disgrace; Sang how the emp'ror show'd an angry face; Swearing the bold advent'rers should be ty'd To a cart's tail, Should they dare fail To leave the city in two days, poor clan! When off they mov'd all mournful, beast and man. At this the court of Frogmore dropp'd a tear; For pity dwells with q? and k? and peer. ‘Yet O think,’ the songster said, ‘Of the pretty smuggling trade! Court and cobbler this pursues: Smuggling, juggling, Juggling, smuggling, Never mind the custom-dues.’ At this the court resum'd the cheerful smile: For smuggling cannot courtly folk defile: Courts may smuggle what they please Lady H?rn?sse and her private card-parties know more of this matter than the poet. The sly nocturnal visits of a certain great lady's sedan-chair from the ? are notorious.— Mob alone, exchequers seize. And now he sung the little box A present, containing a scrap of complimentary rhime, manufactured by Kien Long himself, in answer to the Latin letter sent by the King of Great Britain (but not of his own composition) to the Emperor of China. Poor Sir George Staunton was made overseer of the Latinity; but as the knight had long forgotten his propriæ quæ maribus, the literary vigour of a German was employed for the occasion. Are our universities still in disgrace? Will nothing but Gottingen go down? In the sacred name of Literature, what have our princes imported from thence to astonish, that could not have been given by Cambridge and Oxford?, and old, That caught the sovereign's wild and raptur'd gaze; Which, oh! when open'd, a sad story told! Displaying pot-hooks! not a bulse's blaze. What are rhimes to western kings? Paltry, stupid, jingling things: Learning is a monarch's sport— Wisdom never goes to court. Now came a groan, that seem'd to say, ‘A p?x On all the jingle of th' old driv'ler's box!’ Of taxes now the sweet musician sung The court, the chorus join'd, And fill'd the wond'ring wind; And taxes, taxes, through the garden rung. Monarchs first of taxes think: Taxes are a monarch's treasure ‘Bacchus’ blessings are a treasure, Drinking is the soldier's pleasure,’ &amp;c. DRYDEN. What a poetical and sublime compliment to the military of that day!: ‘Sweet the pleasure, Rich the treasure;’ Monarchs love a guinea's chink. And now to Avarice he tun'd the strain, That suck'd a nation like a spunge— And now to Dissipation's madding train, Who in distress a people plunge; A people that from ruin scarce can 'scape— And now the wide-mouth'd court began to gape. Gaping is the mouth's disease, When a subject fails to please. Now to sad France his plaintive voice he tun'd— Sunk by the wicked sans-culottes so low; Dealing poor Despotism so dire a blow! When, mark! the melting audience almost swoon'd! The songster now a graver subject chose— ‘Who is to pay performers that compose This charming Fete of Frogmore?’ were the words: With much surprise, And rolling eyes, The court heard syllables, that stabb'd like swords; Nwo voices came—‘Mine Gote!—enuff, enuff.’— How! how! what, what? stuff, Incledon, stuff, stuff.’ ‘We pay! no, no! mine Gote, we haf more wit.’— ‘Go, go to Parliament—ask Pitt, ask Pitt.’ With loaded subjects, ah! we see ‘The mighty master smil'd to see, That love was in the next degree.’ DRYDEN. A jack-ass in the next degree ‘The mighty master smil'd to see, That love was in the next degree.’ DRYDEN.; When soon appear'd the emblematic brutes, With chimney-sweepers on their backs, That kick'd, and spur'd, and lash'd their hacks— And well with such tame fools the treatment suits. Off gallop'd, for royal amusement, the asses; 'Mid the haycocks they scamper'd, and knock'd down the lasses— Girls squall'd, the court laugh'd, and the jack-asses bray'd At the sight of the legs by the tumble display'd. Now a couple leap'd down ‘Thais led the way.’ DRYDEN. from their state to the prancers, Musicians and racers, tune-grinders and dancers; Shaking all by the hand His m?y was verily the happiest gentleman in the world, and (si licet parvis componere magna) was as merry as a grig, vowing repetitions of the gala; but by what fatality it has not happened, not even the sagacity of the poet is able to discover., who, in compliment clever, Roar'd aloud, ‘Kings and queens, fun and Frogmore for ever!!!’ THE ROYAL TOUR, AND WEYMOUTH AMUSEMENTS; A Solemn and Reprimanding EPISTLE TO THE LAUREAT. PITT's FLIGHT TO WIMBLEDON, AN ODE. —AN ODE TO THE FRENCH.—ODE TO THE CHARITY-MILL IN WINDSOR-PARK. —A HINT TO A POOR DEMOCRAT.—ODE TO THE QUEEN's ELEPHANT.—THE SORROWS OF SUNDAY; AN ELEGY. ? Aude Cæsaris invicti res dicere. HORACE. Shame on thee, Pye! to Cæsar tune the string; Berhime his route, and Weymouth wonders sing: Saddle thy Pegasus at once—ride post: Lo, ere thou start'st, a thousand things are lost. TO J. PYE, ESQ. SIR, I allow you virtues, I allow you literary talents; but I will not subscribe to your indolence: one little solitary annual ode is not sufficient for a great king. Whatever things are done, whatever things are said, nay, whatever things are conceived by mighty potentates, are treasure for the page of history. Blush, my friend, that a volunteer bard should run off with the merit of recording the wonderful actions and sapient sayings of royalty! As soon as the Mill of Charity was erected in Windsor Park, Lo! at the deed, the muse caught fire, And swell'd, with praise, the sacred lyre, Sweet lass! she could not for her soul sit still. Imagination, on the watch, Op'd, for the swelling flood, the hatch; And, lo! to work, alertly, went her mill. As soon as the royal journey to Weymouth was announced, the same loyal muse Turn'd her brain's pockets inside out, For poetry, to praise the rout. No sooner was the noble elephant from Arcot presented to our beloved queen, and most œconomically and most generously returned on the nabob's hands, on account of his appetite, but the same muse Began a tender melancholy air; Sung how he trudg'd, poor beast, to Peckham fair, And Saint Bartholomew's, to help defray His sad expenses on the wat'ry way. No sooner was a boat ordered by the omnipotent, all-feeling, all-honest, all-delicate, all-constitutional lords of the ? on board Captain Orack's ship, the Phœnix (even before she came to her moorings) for the other presents (fortunately without stomachs!) from the same knowing nabob to her most excellent m?y, not to Mr. Pitt, and his Grace of Portland (for ministers are ciphers now-a-days), but lo, the muse, Attentive ever to great princes, To muslins tun'd her harp, and chintzes; And prophesy'd of ev'ry shawl, That Schw?g would sell them all. A circumstance that actually took place; making we presume, a decent return—the original cost, in India, exceeding ten thousand pounds!!! In future, then, my friend Pye, Let no man say I hate our kings and queens, Princes and drawing-rooms and levee-scenes; Despise the bows and curtsies, whisper'd talk: I love the mumm'ry from my very soul: Daily I spread its fame from pole to pole— What glorious quarry for the muse's hawk! Ask if the man whose heart the chase adores, Wishes annihilation to wild boars, Or wolves so hungry.—‘No,’ the sportsman cries— ‘Long live wild boars and wolves! God bless their eyes!’ May kings exist—and trifle pig with kings! The muse desireth not more precious things— Such sweet mock-grandeur!—so sublimely garish? Let's have no Washingtons: did such appear, The muse and I had ev'ry thing to fear— Soon forc'd to ask a pittance of the parish. Such want no praise—in native virtue strong: 'Tis folly, folly, feeds the poet's song. THE ROYAL TOUR, OR WEYMOUTH AMUSEMENTS. PROËMIUM. Great is of hair-powder the sale My ingenious poem so called; not Mr. Pitt's ingenious tax on that subject, which, we are well informed, succeeds as miserably in produce, as reputation.— Dundas and Pitt have both turn'd pale; Yet courtiers cry aloud its want of merit. Courtiers have try'd with all their spite To sink it in Oblivion's night— My friend, the Public, keeps it up with spirit. How often we have seen a bullying cloud Attack the sun, and quarrel too aloud; Spit, thunder, lighten, frighten the two poles, Blocking up ev'ry avenue for peeping; On this side now, and now on that side creeping; A sort of dirty malkin stopping holes! Sometimes the worried glorious god of day Insists upon a view, and shows an eye; Just as a manager, when some sad play Is taken ill, and very like to die, Kens through the curtain on the critic nation, All hissing, clatt'ring, howling out damnation. Thus Envy, the vile hag, attacks my rhimes, Swearing they shall not peep on distant times; But violent indeed will be the tussel; I deem myself, indeed, a tuneful whale: She swears I'm not upon so large a scale; Rather a wrinkle, limpet, paltry muscle, Clinging to heavy rocks, or wooden things, Meaning my loyalty, perchance, to kings. The public seems to like my brats, Begot, indeed, with little pain— Whether it turbot gives, or sprats, Behold another to maintain! Thus, then, I cast it on that sea the town: If true, it swims; if spurious, let it drown. See! Cæsar's off! the dust around him hovers, And, gathering, lo, the King of Glory covers! The royal hubbub fills both eye and ear, And wide-mouth'd wonder marks the wild career. How like his golden brother of the sky, When nature thunders, and the storm is high; Now in, now out of clouds, behind, before, Who rolls amid the elemental roar. Heav'ns! with what ardour thro' the lanes he drives, The country trembling for its tenants' lives! Squat on his speckled haunches gapes the toad, And frogs affrighted hop along the road; The hares astonish'd to their terrors yield, Cock their long ears, and scud from field to field; The owl, loud hooting, from his ivy rushes; And sparrows, chatt'ring, flutter from the bushes: Old women (call'd ‘a pack of blinking b?s),’ Dash'd by the thund'ring light-horse into ditches, Scrambling and howling, with post?rs pointed, Sad picture! plump against the Lord's Anointed. Dogs bark, pigs grunt, the flying turkeys gobble; Fowls cackle; screaming geese, with stretch'd wing, hobble; Dire death his horses' hoofs to ducklings deal, And goslings gape beneath the burning wheel! Thus the great Æol, when he rushes forth, With all his winds, east, west, and south, and north; Flutter the leaves of trees, with woful fright, Shook by his rage, and bullied by his might! Straws from the lanes dispers'd, and whirl'd in air, The blustering wonders of his mouth declare. Heav'd from their deep foundations, with dread sound Barns and old houses thunder to the ground, And bowing oaks, in ages rooted strong, Roar through their branches as he sweeps along! George breakfasts on the road, gulps tea, bolts toast; Jokes with the waiter, witty with the host; Runs to the garden with his morning dues; Makes mouths at Cloacina's; reads the news. Now mad for fruit, he scours the garden round; Knocks every apple that he spies, to ground; Loads ev'ry royal pocket, seeks his chaise; Plumps in, and fills the village with amaze! He's off again—he smokes along the road! Pursue him, Pye—pursue him with an ode: And yet a pastoral might better please; That talks of sheep, and hay, and beans and peas; Of trees cut down Great has been the massacre among the sturdy oaks, to make room for the courtier-like pliability of the corn-stalk, that brings mere grist to the royal mill., that Richmond's lawn adorn, To gain the pittance of a peck of corn. He reaches Weymouth—treads the Esplanade— Hark, hark, the jingling bells! the cannonade! Drums beat, the hurdigurdies grind the air; Dogs, cats, old women, all upon the stare: All Weymouth gapes with wonder—hark! huzzas! The roaring welcome of a thousand jaws! O Pye, shalt thou, Apollo's fav'rite son, In loyalty by Peter be outdone? How oft I bear thy master on my back, Without one thimbleful of cheering sack; While thou (not drunk, I hope), O bard divine, Oft wett'st thy whistle with the muse's wine! O haste where prostrate courtiers monarchs greet, Like cats that seek the sunshine of the street; Where Chesterfield, the lively spaniel, springs, Runs, leaps, and makes rare merriment for kings; Where sharp Macmanus, and sly Jealous, tread, To guard from treach'ry's blow the royal head Be it recollected with horror, that a stone was flung at our beloved sovereign in St. James's Park, about two or three years past, endangering his life; yet an impudent rhimer thought otherwise; who, on the occasion, had the audacity to write the following epigram: Talk no more of lucky escape of the head, From a flint so unwittingly thrown: I think very diff'rent—with thousands indeed, 'Twas a lucky escape for the stone.; Where Nunn and Barber Two tradesmen, who repair constantly from London to Weymouth, when royalty deigns to visit the spot., silent as the mouse, Steal, nightly, certain goods to Glo'ster House. O say, shall Cæsar in rare presents thrive; Buy cheaper, too, than any man alive; Go cheaper in excursions on the water, And laureat Pye know nothing of the matter! Acts that should bid his poet's bosom flame, And make his spendthrift subjects blush with shame! What tho' Tom Warton laugh'd at kings and queens, And, grinning, ey'd them just as state machines; Much better pleas'd (so sick of royal life) To celebrate 'Squire Punch and Punch's wife? I grant thee deep in Attic, Latian lore; Yet learn the province of the muse of yore: The bards of ancient times (so hist'ry sings) Eat, drank, and danc'd, and slept with mighty kings, Who courted, reverenc'd, lov'd the tuneful throng, And deem'd their deeds ennobled by a song. Lo, Pitt arrives! alas, with lantern face! ‘What, hæ, Pitt, hæ—what, Pitt, hæ, more disgrace?’ ‘Ah, sire, bad news! a second dire defeat! Vendee undone, and all the Chouans beat!’ ‘Hæ, hæ, what, what?—beat, beat?—what, beat agen? Well, well, more money—raise more men, more men. But mind, Pitt, hæ—mind, huddle up the news; Coin something, and the growling land amuse: Make all the sans-culottes to Paris caper, And Rose shall print the vict'ry in his paper. Let's hear no more, no more of Cornish tales— I sha'n't refund a guinea, Pitt, to Wales: I can't afford it, no—I can't afford: Wales cost a deal in pocket-cash and board. ‘Pitt, Pitt, there's Frost, my bailiff Frost—see, see! Well, Pitt, go back, go back again—b'ye, b'ye: Keep London still—no matter how they carp— Well, well, go back, and bid Dundas look sharp. Must not lose France—no, France must wear a crown: If France won't swallow, ram a monarch down. Some crowns are scarce worth sixpences—hæ, Pitt?’— The premier smil'd, and left the royal wit. Now Frost approaches—‘Well, Frost, well, Frost, pray, How, how went sheep a score?—how corn and hay?’ ‘An't please your majesty, a charming price: Corn very soon will be as dear as spice.’ ‘Thank God! but, say, say, do the poor complain? Hæ, hæ, will wheat be sixpence, Frost, a grain?’ ‘I hope not, sire; for great were then my fears, That Windsor would be pull'd about our ears.’ ‘Frost, Frost, no politics—no, no, Frost, no: You, you talk politics! oho, oho! Windsor come down about our ears! what, what? D'ye think, hæ, hæ, that I'm afraid of that? What, what are soldiers good for, but obey? Macmanus, Townsend, Jealous, hæ, hæ, hæ? Pull Windsor down? hæ, what?—a pretty job! Windsor be pull'd to pieces by the mob! Talk, talk of farming—that's your fort, d'ye see; And, mind, mind, politics belong to me. Go back, go back, and watch the Windsor chaps; Count all the poultry: set, set well the traps. ‘See, see! see! Stacie The honest master of the Royal Hotel.—here, here, Stacie, here— Going to market, Stacie?—dear, dear, dear! I get all my provision by the mail— Hæ, money plenty, Stacie? don't fear jail. Rooms, rooms all full? hæ, hæ, no beds to spare? What, what! give trav'lers, hæ, good fare, good fare? Good sign, good sign, to have no empty beds! Shows, shows that people like to see crown'd heads.’ The mail arrives This mail-coach costs the public at least fifty pounds every day of the week (Sundays not excepted) during the king's residence at Weymouth—It is really a sutler's cart.! hark! hark! the cheerful horn, To majesty announcing oil and corn; Turnips and cabbages, and soap and candles; And, lo, each article great Cæsar handles! Bread, cheese, salt, catchup, vinegar, and mustard, Small beer, and bacon, apple-pie, and custard: All, all, from Windsor greets his frugal grace, For Weymouth is a d?mn'd expensive place. Sal'sb'ry appears, the lord of stars and strings; Presents his poem This high lord is really a high poet. His journey to Weymouth, which I was horribly afraid would have forestalled mine with the public, will make its appearance soon, and, I am informed, will be enriched, like my works, O marvelling reader! most elegantly bound at this time, and in the library, at Buckingham-house, with royal annotation. to the best of kings. Great Cæsar reads it—feels a laughing fit, And wonders Sal'sb'ry should become a wit. A batch of bullocks! see great Cæsar run: He stops the drover—bargain is begun. He feels their ribs and rumps—he shakes his head— ‘Poor, drover, poor—poor, very poor indeed.’ Cæsar and drover haggle—diff'rence split— How much?—a shilling! what a royal hit! A load of hay in sight! great Cæsar flies— Smells—shakes his head—‘Bad hay—sour hay’—he buys. ‘Smell, Courtown—smell—good bargain—lucky load; Smell, Courtown—sweeter hay was never mow'd.’ A herd of swine goes by!—‘Whose hogs are these? Hæ, farmer, hæ?’—‘Yours, measter, if you pleaze.’ ‘Poor, farmer, poor—lean, lousy, very poor— Sell, sell, hæ, sell?’—‘Iss, measter, to be zure: My pigs were made for zale, but what o'that? Yow caall mun lean; now, zur, I caall mun vat— Measter, I baant a starling—can't be cort; You think, agosh, to ha the pigs vor nort.’ Lo! Cæsar buys the pigs—he slily winks— ‘Hæ Gwinn, the fellow is not caught, he thinks— Fool, not to know the bargain I have got! Hæ, Gwinn, nice bargain—lucky, lucky lot!’ Enter the dancing dogs! they take their stations; They bow, they curtsy to the lord of nations; They dance, they skip, they charm the k? of fun, While courtiers see themselves almost outdone. Lord Paulet enters on his hands and knees, Joining the hunts of hares with hunts of fleas The earl has won the royal smile, and is made a lord of the bed-chamber; but as capricious inconstancy is a prominent feature in the Brunswick family, a royal frown may be at no great distance.. Enter Sir Joseph! gladd'ning royal eyes! What holds his hand? a box of butterflies, Grubs, nests, and eggs of humming-birds, to please; Noots, tadpoles, brains of beetles, stings of bees. The noble president without a bib on, To sport the glories of his blushing ribbon! The fishermen! the fishermen behold! A shoal of fish! the men their nets unfold; Surround the scaly fry—they drag to land: Cæsar and Co. rush down upon the sand; The fishes leap about—Gods! what a clatter! Cæsar, delighted, jumps into the water— He marvels at the fish with fins and scales— He plunges at them—seizes heads and tails; Enjoys the draught—he capers—laughs aloud, And shows his captives to the gaping crowd. He orders them to Glo'ster Lodge—they go: But are the fishermen rewarded?—No!!! Cæsar spies Lady Cathcart with a book; He flies to know what 'tis—he longs to look. ‘What's in your hand, my lady? let me know.’ ‘A book, an't please your m?y.’—‘Oho! Book's a good thing—good thing—I like a book. Very good thing, my lady—let me look— War of America! my lady, hæ? Bad thing, my lady!—fling, fling that away.’ A sailor pops upon the royal pair, On crutches borne—an object of despair: His squalid beard, pale cheek, and haggard eye, Though silent, pour for help a piercing cry. ‘Who, who are you? what, what? hæ, what are you?’ ‘A man, my liege, whom kindness never knew.’ ‘A sailor! sailor, hæ; you've lost a leg.’ ‘I know it, sir—which forces me to beg. I've nine poor children, sir, besides a wife— God bless them! the sole comforts of my life.’ ‘Wife and nine children, hæ?—all, all alive? No, no, no wonder that you cannot thrive. Shame, shame, to fill your hut with such a train! Shame to get brats for others to maintain Is not this sarcasm as applicable to thrones as hovels?! Get, get a wooden leg, or one of cork: Wood's cheapest—yes, get wood, and go to work. But mind, mind, sailor—hæ, hæ, hæ,—hear, hear— Don't go to Windsor, mind, and cut one there: That's dangerous, dangerous—there I place my traps; Fine things, fine things, for legs of thieving chaps: Best traps, my traps—take care—they bite, they bite, And sometimes catch a dozen legs a night.’ ‘Oh! had I money, sir, to buy a leg!’ ‘No money, hæ? nor I—go beg—go beg.’— How sweetly kind to bid the cripple mump, And cut from other people's trees a stump! How vastly like our kind Archbishop M?e It is reported, but we hope falsely, that our metropolitan, as well as Mrs. M?e, are really tired with the number of poor creatures who, three times a week, have, from time immemorial, claimed the charitable donation of broth and meat from Lambeth Palace. It is moreover added, that a strong application has been made for the removal of this nuisance, but hitherto without success., Who, hating beggar tribes at Lambeth door, Of meaner parsons bids them ask relief— There, carry their coarse jugs for broth and beef! ‘Mine Gote! your mashesty!—don't hear sush stuff: De workhouse always geefs de poor enough. Why make bout dirty leg sush wondrous fuss?— And den, what impudence for beg of us! In Strelitz, O mine Gote! de beggar skip: Dere, for a sharity, we geefs a whip. Money make subshects impudent, I'm sure— Respect be always where de peepel's poor.’ ‘How, sailor, did you lose your leg?—hæ, hæ?’ ‘I lost it, please your majesty, at sea, Hard fighting for my country and my king.’ ‘Hæ, what—that's common, very common thing. Hæ! lucky fellow, that you were not drill'd: Some lose their heads, and many men are kill'd. Your parish? where's your parish? hæ—where, where?’ ‘I serv'd my 'prenticeship in Manchester.’ ‘Fine town, fine town—full, full of trade and riches; Hæ, sailor, hæ, can you make leather breeches? These come from Manchester—there, there I got 'em!’ On which great Cæsar smacks his buckskin bottom. ‘Must not encourage vagrants—no, no, no— Must not make laws, my lad, and break 'em too. Where, where's your parish, hæ? and where's your pass? Well, make haste home—I've got, I've got no brass. Now to the Esplanade a seat is borne, To ease the q?'s sweet bottom and her corn; For corns are apt ev'n majesty to bite, As well as on poor toes to vend their spite. Around the gracious q? of England, lo, Dames of the bed-chamber, a goodly row! Mob passing by, of majesty so fond, Dipping, like ducks, their noddles in a pond. How would this sight of Strelitz charm the soul? A lofty land, although a spider hole! Avaunt, all frail-ones, from the q?'s chaste view! Pollution taints the air with such a crew! Dare ye approach? full soon ye meet resistance; Imhoff's pure wife One of the Parklane triumvirate of sm?g?lers. shall shove you at a distance: The east's proud empress, who, with di'mond wand, Can visit the first lady of the land; Nay, more, the chronicles of truth aver, Can make the land's first lady visit her! She comes! the majesty of this fair isle Greets Mistress Imhoff with an ell-wide smile; Bids her partake the radiance of a crown, And, on the seat of Innocence, sit down. Lo, down she sits! the mob, all envying, views, As Mistress Imhoff whispers Indian news. The Stadtholder! he joins Queen Charlotte—bump Falls on the seat of royalty, his rump! Peace to his spirit! he begins to doze! He snores! heav'ns bless the trumpet of his nose! So great is folly, that the world mayhap Shall, grinning, point at Hoogen Moogen's nap. Princes of Europe, pray exclaim not ‘shame!’ Go, for mankind's repose, and do the same. My Lady H?e appears! how large! Deep laden, like a camel, or a barge. What's all beneath her petticoats?—Shawls, chintz— Why should the muse, indeed, the matter mince? Muslins the richest, of the fertile east. Lo, back she moves again, to be undrest! At Glo'ster-Lodge, upon the bed she squats, To drop the lumber, shawls, and broider'd brats; Where England's happy ? her steps pursues, Attends the labour, and turns accoucheuse. Hark! Cæsar and the little children talk; Together laugh, together too they walk: The mob around admire their pleasant things, And marle that children talk as well as kings. And now to Delamot's the m?h speeds: He catches up a score of books, and reads— Learns nothing—sudden quits the book-abode— Orders his horse, and scours the Dorset road. He's in again; he boards the barge—sets sail— Jokes with the sailors, and enjoys the gale: Descants on winds and waves—the land regains, And gives the tars just nothing for their pains! For, what a bore that kings their slaves should pay! Sufficient is the honour of the day! Now springs the sov'reign wildly to the seas— Rushes intrepid in—along to knees!— Old Neptune, jealous of his world, looks big— And blust'ring Boreas blows away his wig. O Pye! amidst such doings canst thou sleep? Such wonders whelping on the land and deep! So nobly form'd to deck th' historic page, Astonish man, and swell the muse's rage! Thus, thus I sing of royalty unpaid; In courts observe, and follow to the shade; And mean, God willing, since thou wilt not write, To give each word and action to the light; With daily deeds my voice sublimely raise, And sound wise speeches into distant days. In spite of low Democracy, the brute, Kings shall at length regain their lost repute. The poor sunk falcon, robb'd of ev'ry plume, That snaps the ground, and mourns his humble doom, With powerful pinion soon from earth shall rise, Mix with the solar blaze, and sweep the skies. Such shall be done, if pow'r the bard can boast, Who deems the breed too precious to be lost. And since Augustus deign'd with bards to dine, And, blest with bards, Mecænas drank his wine; O let us hope that mighty modern kings May cease to class the bards with vulgar things, And of the tuneful tribe think somewhat higher, Than Newgate's bellman, or a country crier Never were the ??????, alias poets, in more disesteem than at the court of the Brunswicks. Homer, singing of such as were the greatest favourites of ancient monarchs mentions ?????? ?????, ???????, ??????, and ??????, i.e. a doctor, a house carpenter, and a conjuror. These our beloved S?n, following this classical example of antiquity, has noticed and recommended: Doctor Willis, to parliament; Sir William Chambers, to the comptrollership of the board of works; and Signor Pinetti, to the patronage of all the conjurors of the metropolis.! Should this rare æra rise, and Brunswick's grace Revive the drooping glory of his race; How happy at St. James's, my friend Pye, At Buckingham and Windsor, thou and I, To see fair Genius re-assume her reign; Dulness and Avarice expell'd the scene; The fat'ning bards their laurell'd fronts display, And proudly triumph over hogs and hay! Once more then let me beg thee, lazy Pye, To follow monarchs wheresoe'er they fly: When, from the lofty pinnacle of thrones, They sink, to tread, with vulgar folks, the stones; To Weymouth waves, and sands, and shops repair; Dash country Joans with dread, and bumpkins scare: In laugh, and hop, and skip, and jump, and jest, For ever trifling, and for ever blest. How like the rustic boy, the simple thing, Who only wish'd to be a mighty king (So meanly modest was his pray'r to Fate), To eat fat pork, and ride upon a gate! MR. PITT'S FLIGHT TO WIMBLEDON. Just as I prophesy'd!—the storm begins! And thou art off—for Wimbledon, I ween, To hide thee there for all thy courtly sins, So complaisant indeed to king and queen! Loud was thy window's crash—a show'r of stones Pour'd in thick vollies from the anger'd mob: How the rude pebbles sought thy vanish'd bones! And cry'd aloud, ‘Where is the fellow's knob?’ But disappointed, on the carpet spread, They griev'd they could not rattle round thy head. Dundas's hay-loft soon, I guess, In secrecy wilt thou possess; Or else another secret nameless place— A sweet asylum from the rage Of such as desp'rate battle wage With men who plunge the nation in disgrace. This was a terrible affair! Undoubtedly it made thee stare! Indeed I think that thou wert right, To ask the friendship of a flight. Alas! when Danger his stern form reveals, There's really wisdom in a pair of heels! Since not a soul dares ope his jaws To plead, O Pitt, thy awkward cause, I'll be thy counsel, man, to bring thee off: Not save thy reputation—no— That's an Herculean work, I trow; Thy name must bear, indeed, th' eternal scoff. Come from thy hay-loft then, or thy retreat Where Cloacina keeps her silent seat, And let me lead thee to the people's eye: Kneel down before them—own thy heavy guilt, For meanness and king-flatt'ry—treasure spilt, And other sins too glaring to deny. This then be thy confession, Pitt:— ‘Alas! by mad Ambition bit, And grinding Hunger, too, I needs must say; Where fickle Fortune loves to sport, I sought the region of the court; But Conscience damns, alas! the idle day. ‘I bawl'd reform with Richmond's lord, But never meant to keep my word: Our bellowing frighten'd the great man and woman; With patriot threats we forc'd our way, And, while 'twas sunshine, made our hay, A trick with statesmen by no means uncommon. ‘Ye gave me credit for my cries, And, gull'd, with pleasure saw me rise; Though soon, too soon, ye mock'd the royal choice; Too soon I read in ev'ry face The hist'ry of a sad disgrace, Heard execration load the gen'ral voice. ‘The breeze of popularity soon died— Soon ebb'd of Fame, alas! th' inconstant tide: Yet held I places, in the people's spite; Agreed, amongst my other sins, For cursed Hanoverian skins; Agreed for Gallic despotism to fight: Agreed to pay th' apothecary's bill, And load, with your good grist, the royal mill. ‘Whisper'd the nation's purse was all their own; That subjects were rank rascals to complain; Who, silent, ought to bear the galling chain; And swore rebellion lurk'd in ev'ry groan. ‘I own, the royal barns are full of corn; The finest, fattest beeves the land adorn; The fairest sheep in Windsor fields are seen: Increase on ev'ry acre smiles, The richest 'mid the queen of isles:— All these belonging to our K. and Q. ‘But what can I?—I dare not speak— I dare not say the people squeak, And sullen look, and threat, and swear, and cry, 'Tis a vile shame the realm should starve: Why should not we have fowls to carve, Although he is, forsooth, so wondrous high? We put him there—we gave him all his money— 'Tis hard the bees that made should want the honey.’ ‘R?d shall out, the man of leathern guns, Whom Brav'ry scorns, and beauteous Science shuns; Whom seeming idiotism and madness rules; The veriest laughing-stock of veriest fools. H?y no more shall drain the hectic state, And suck, the leach, the empire to her fate. ‘Lo, from the seat of Justice will I sweep The fur-clad rogue, renown'd for stealing sheep Whether this notorious and lofty limb of the law will be hanged or not, even the prophetic powers of the Muse cannot foretell; but that a score of stolen sheep, which the owners swore to, were in this fellow's pens, exhibited for sale at a country fair, is a fact that admits of no contradiction. Many bets are pending; and the odds, as well as the hopes of the country, are on the rope.. ‘I blush to think I help'd the wars of kings, And, meanly crouching, made a royal pother: I now think princes very so-so things; The one half cheats, and arrant fools the other. Ev'n to the tune she chooses, let her dance: I'll cram no despots down the throat of France. ‘I own myself, alas! an arrant fool, Not to suspect, and look that Prussian through: Yet to Hypocrisy I went to school; But, hang the fellow, ‘he was Yorkshire too.’ ‘When out of place, I thunder'd state reform— Cry'd, venal parliaments are cursed things: But when in place—Don't, don't provoke the storm; Why alter, why displease the best of kings? Such is the creed of all the courtier train; Rocks of your hopes—the imps that ye maintain. ‘As sharks and whales pick daily a good dish From all the dainty under-world of fish, So tyrants, at a most ungodly rate, For human dishes daily, hourly, prowl; And, as the weazel sucks the eggs of fowl, They, greedy, suck that larger egg, the state. ‘But no such master will I serve, Nor mistress, christen'd k? and q?; Who, whilst their plunder'd subjects starve, Are, 'midst their hoarded millions, seen. ‘The people's servant, till by fate o'erpower'd, By G? that people shall not be devour'd!’ Thus if thou swearest—hear me—By our skins, Which yet our bastinado'd backs retain; Gen'rous, we'll wipe out thy old score of sins, And yield thee suff'rance to begin again. Thus if thou swearest, and wilt sin no more, A pardon shall be thine—our anger o'er. Heed not the wrath of kings—the nation made 'em— The people put on board their backs their honours; And should kings forfeit their esteem, the donors Can (if I err not) in a trice unlade 'em. Such, Pitt, is my advice—but thou art proud Although so lately one of us poor crowd; Crawling, by mean degrees, to thine high station: Thou canst not well remember thy old rags, Or thou hadst been more sparing of thy brags; Insulting thus a much too generous nation. Lo, thus the lad in base Saint Giles's born, Blest with a barrow, first begins to bawl; Where Plenty, ah! exalteth not her horn— Potatoes the poor barrow's little all! At length, succeeding by a lucky cry, And Fortune's fav'ring smile, the lad can buy A basket!—nay, two baskets for his barrow; To which he hangs the baskets with much pride, With endive, cellery, and greens beside— Yes, with much pride, that warms his inmost marrow— With all the gaping energy of song, Proudly he rolls his whole estate along! Ambition still inspires his panting heart; And now sublime he rises to a cart, But not without a jackass, let me say: A jack is harness'd—on the cart he mounts— Looks round—elate, his cabbages he counts, And triumphs in his partner's Brudenell-bray. He stops not here—Ambition goads his soul To bid his orb in loftier regions roll, In Govent-Garden, lo, a shop he gains! Pines, nect'rines, plums, and apricots, and peaches, Behold! his laudable ambition reaches; And now the jack-ass and the cart disdains. An ass's ditty wounds his nicer ear, Bringing to mind his late and humble sphere: Archbishop-like, he tow'rs within his stall— Looks on the barrow, cart, and basket crew, With all the consequence of man, askew, And, for a pack of beggars damns them all. ODE TO THE FRENCH. Oh! with what freedom have ye treated kings! Say, did ye not equip their backs with wings, Yet cruelly cut off their heads for flying? Alas! so lately did ye kings adore! Now 'tis a wolf, a lion, a wild boar— A hypocrite, a thing of theft and lying. What folly to create the hungry kite, Yet quarrel with his appetite and claws; Or grumble at the tiger's ravenous bite, Yet give the savage such a pair of jaws! For ever are ye plung'd in mad extremes! Let Common Sense, then, rouse you from your dreams. Grandeur, I own, seems much increas'd in size; Much gaudier too her dress to mortal eyes. The lofty lords and ladies of our isle, Enough to make a grave old Tom cat smile, Must ev'ry thing, forsooth, in style enjoy; And if to Margate doctors bid them go, By sea, to purify from head to toe, Turn up their dainty noses at a hoy. ‘Foh! in a hoy, the filthy thing, embark! Loaded with beasts of all kind—Noah's ark!’— So nice! that, had they by good chance been born When Captain Noah put his wife on board, With all his other live stock, they had sworn To go together boldly to the Lord; That is to say, be drown'd!—bid life adieu, Sooner than sail with such a stinking crew. Yet let me add—not all the great are nice; Not all by pride are tainted, the vile vice— No! witness our good k? and our good q?, Lord love 'em!—our most humble q? and k? Can, gracious, stoop to any little thing, However humble, not however mean. Heav'ns bless their pretty, goodly, greasy graces! I've seen them bolt fat bacon at the races; On Ascot course, devour such loads of ham, And wash it down, so dainty, with a dram! How simple! like to many an ancient king, That roasted royal dinners by a string, And turn'd the royal rapier to a spit: Though full of magnanimity, could stoop To boil, in their grand helmets, beef and soup, And eat from thence, so great their saving wit! When good prince ? The name of this young Strelitz man or prince is absolutely forgotten; but he is, or was, full brother to our most gracious queen. deign'd visit our small isle, Grand soul! he came in very humble style— Cut no huge figure—made no mighty flash: Two shirts belong'd unto the princely lad; 'Twas all the linen treasure that he had, Which poor old Mother Davies us'd to wash; Goody of Richmond! mother to the man Dr. Davies, the present provost of Eton college. Who strikes with rev'rent awe the Eton clan. ‘Dear prince,’ quoth Mother Davies, ‘many a time The lad in linen was so wondrous short, I've made 'n wait until I clean'd the grime, To make 'n, like a Christian, go to court. ‘Yes, on my thorn there, many and many an eye Hath seen his honour's linen hang to dry; But soon, indeed, t'increase his little store, His sister, madam, made a couple more.’ But to return—folks thought strange things of yore, When no absurdity Belief could shock; When gossip Prejudice put in her oar, To scull the simple mind on Error's rock. What thousands thought that kings and queens eat gold! That beef and mutton was too coarse a fare; And that their bodies were so finely soul'd, They breath'd a fluid beyond vulgar air. Could not conceive that air so gross and common, Entering a dog's and cat's, and monkey's nose, Inflated a queen's lungs, so great a woman; Or king's, whom such rare particles compose. Yes! 'tis confess'd that Folly rul'd mankind— 'Twas once the same with me the bard, I find. I grant that I, in life's more early day, Deem'd kings young God-almighties—form'd for sway; The universe, fee simple—all their own: Though now I think the people claim a right To somewhat rather larger than a mite; Nay, that we should ev'n halve it with the throne. I cry'd, ‘Nought's little which great kings approve; Kings turn, like Midas, all they touch to gold— Witness Lord Hawk'sb'ry, turn'd, by royal love, From Jenkinson, a clod of meanest mould.’ Witness the once poor Rose, though now a lord, Great at the Treas'ry's honourable board. What is there in a fog? ‘Nought! nought!’ ye cry. To me a fog was once important—why? Immortal Cæsar cloth'd the fog with glory! How, in the name of wonder—read the story. CÆSAR AND THE FOG. CÆSAR, upon a summer's golden day, Got early from his bed to smell his hay, And see if all his fowls were safe and sound; And likewise see what traps had legs and feet Belonging unto men who wish'd to treat Their chaps with chicken, on forbidden ground. Enter a general (Carpenter) low bowing, Scraping, and, mandarin-like, nodding, ploughing With nose of rev'rence sweet, the humble grass.— ‘Hæ, gen'ral, hæ? what news, what news in town?’ ‘None, sire.’—‘None, gen'ral?—Gen'ral, hæ, none, none?’ ‘Nothing indeed, O king, is come to pass.’ ‘Strange! strange! what, what—see nothing on the way? Hæ, hæ?’ cry'd Cæsar, all for news agog. ‘Nothing, my liege—no, nothing I may say, Excepting upon Hounslow, sir, a fog.’ ‘Fog upon Hounslow, gen'ral?—large fog, hæ, Or small fog, gen'ral?’—‘Large, an't please your sire.’ ‘Strange, vastly strange!—what, large fog, large fog, pray? Yes, yes, yes—large fog, that I much admire.’ Cæsar and Carpenter now talk'd of wars, Of cannon, bullets, swords, and wounds, and scars: When, in the middle of the fight, the king Sudden exclaim'd—‘Fog upon Hounslow, hæ? ‘Large fog too, gen'ral?—well, go on, on, pray— ‘Strange! very strange!—extr'ordinary thing!’ Now dwelt the gen'ral on the battle's rage, Where muskets, muskets—guns, great guns engage, Red'ning with blood the field, and stream, and bog; When rushing from the murd'rous scene of glory, The monarch sudden marr'd the gen'ral's story— ‘Fog upon Hounslow, gen'ral—large, large fog?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said Carpenter unto the king— ‘Strange! very strange!—extr'ordinary thing!’ At length the gen'ral finish'd—lucky elf!— With much politeness, and much sweat and pain. ‘Thank God! thank God!’ he whisper'd to himself; ‘Curse me, if ever I find fogs again!’ Thus, then, I rev'renc'd fogs in former days, Because I worshipp'd kings; and though I cease King-adoration, kings shall share my praise, Although the gape of Wonder may decrease. I star'd on kings as comets, with amaze: But now a deal diminish'd is the blaze. Kings are mere tallow-candles, nine in ten, Wanting a little snuffing now and then; Harb'ring a thief that plays a dangerous game; Which if we did not watch, and strait pursue, The fat is in the fire! and then adieu That grease so rich, the parent of the flame. Nay, worse event from this same thief appears! The house, at times, is burnt about our ears. Yet pray, sirs, take a king from Mister Pitt, And calmly to the sov'reign's will submit; And not, as ye have done, on madness border: Nay, list to me, for oracles I tell— Kings for the people may do very well, Like candles and their thieves, when kept in order. ODE TO THE MILL, Erected in Windsor Park, for grinding Corn at a cheap Rate for the Poor. I Said, his m?y was very good! Ready to sacrifice his royal blood— Yes, for the poor, each precious drop to spill: And now behold the corn is grinding down; Such is the glorious bounty of the crown! And, lo, in Windsor Park a stately mill! Blow, blow, ye breezes—faster, gentle gales! Oh, for the poor of Windsor fill the sails! Egham and Staines—not Brentford, that vile place Whose wicked imps, in royalty's despite, Rush'd to the royal gardens at deep night, And foully murder'd half the Dryad race. Blow, gentle gales; ye breezes, harder blow; Or soon the charity will cease to flow: Ships to Old Thames are pouring in with corn, While Madam Ceres whets her scythe and hook: I hear the clanking sound in every nook; The reaper's song already cheers the morn. I said his majesty was good and great; And that the famish'd poor would have a treat: And now, behold, they fatten on the flour! Vile Chronicle, I know what thou wilt say— ‘Why do not monarchs give the flour away? Why not a part of hoarded millions pour?’ Grind, gentle mill, and bring down all the bran; The blacker 'tis, the wholesomer for man. I know that saucy Englishmen will say: ‘Why will not monarchs give their beef away, While famine's face stares forth from ev'ry door? How, with an easy heart, can monarchs keep Such droves of cattle, and such flocks of sheep, While Hunger gnaws the vitals of the poor?’ Grind, gentle mill, with speed, the corn away; Nor heed what envious, jealous people say, ‘Why,’ cries the mob, ‘bejewell'd shines the q?, While Poverty appears with sallow mien? All know the millions—'twas from us they came: To shine while thus we suffer, is a shame.’ Worms! know ye not that Hanover is poor, The fav'rite spot of our most gracious k?? And shall no guineas, O ye fools, go o'er, Where all our princes drank at Wisdom's spring? Grind, gentle mill—nor let one grain be lost: Well knows the monarch what a bushel cost. Is not poor Strelitz very poor indeed, That gave this nation a most gracious q?? And, O ye rogues, in hist'ry shall we read, That guineas never were in Strelitz seen? Inform me, fools, what jewels can go there, To match the goodly jewel sent us here? Fools! was not Hesse as poor as a church mouse, Till kind Amelia sent her thousands o'er? At once lank Poverty forsook the house, And, 'stead of straw, a carpet grac'd the floor. In thee what semblance unto k?s I find! Not British, but to foreign k?s, I trust; Who of the simple poor the faces grind, Just as thou grindest ev'ry grain to dust. Grind, gentle mill, with all thy kind endeavour! O grind away!—for better late than never This most astonishing charity soon expired. The children of Famine poured in too plentifully upon the royal munificence; which very soon must have reduced majesty to the same most pitiable situation!. A HINT TO A POOR DEMOCRAT. Say not unto a k?, ‘Thou fool!’—For why? 'Tis unpolite—though possibly no lie: The speech too blights Preferment's opening bud. Make monarchs and Dame Wisdom near relations, And all the Virtues too—such kin-creations May work thy temporalities much good. Laud to each word, however weak, be giv'n, And let each earthy action scent of Heav'n. To cry, ‘Thou fool!’ were foolish, let me say; Because kings have so much to give away.— Steps to preferment are compos'd of flatt'ries: So easily ye scale her lofty walls, Just as ye mount the summit of St. Paul's— But truths!—aye, what are truths?—oh! fatal batt'ries! Or if we change the figure, fatal ropes, That of Ambition hang the lofty hopes. Truths should be only spoken of the Devil; Though that's ungrateful too, and eke uncivil. ‘But hast not thou,’ exclaims the man of spleen? ‘Taken strange liberties with k? and q?? Laugh'd at Idolatry who hugs a throne? Well! grant my want of rev'rence for a crown; Equal to him is Fortune's smile and frown, Whose modest teeth can deign to pick a bone. My passions are the children (easy creatures) Of Moderation! boast the mother's features, And mother's chaste simplicity, the dove; Can sleep upon the humble sod, and swill, With great good glee, the valley's lucid rill, And batten on the berries of the grove. Look at yon group of sucking pigs—how blest! What makes them so?—clean straw to form a nest! So slight a thing their happiness composes! What dialogue! how arch they squint about! Now bury their sweet heads—now pull them out, And toss the wisps so white upon their noses. These pigs are just my passions, that can draw Mirth and contentment from a simple straw. Thy passions are of lofty wing perchance, Pant for the ortolan and wines of France; Unblest, if ven'son turn not on thy spit; Unblest, if turtle smoke not on thy board. Go then, and flatter Britain's mighty lord, Kneel to Dundas, and prostrate fall to Pitt. ODE TO THE ELEPHANT, Just arrived from Bengal, as a Present from the Nabob of Arcot to her Majesty. Poor fellow! thou art come, but come in vain; And mayst as well, methinks, go back again! Thy meat and passage give our court the spleen: Dear, very dear, is now all sort of meat; And all such luckless presents as can eat Have found no favour yet with k? or q?. Now hadst thou been a diamond (no bad size), Or pearl, or ruby, how the royal eyes Had idoliz'd thee! gloried to behold! Rather too bulky for a broche, I fear, Or pin, or pretty pendant for the ear— But then thou wouldst have been cut up and sold. Yes! thou hadst then been welcome—but, alas! Since nought but flesh and blood! then munching grass, And what is most insufferable, corn; Such sad expenses never can be borne. Of Windsor, Richmond, Kew, the helpless poor, Whose plaints have made the royal eyes run o'er, Live on their gracious bounty ev'ry day: For them their Graces ope their golden bags; To good warm broad-cloth change their dirty rags, And round their hovel cast a royal ray. Seek then thy glooms again, and dusky loves— The Great Mogul perhaps of eastern groves. A crying sin, O elephant, is thine— Thy stomach form'd on such a monstrous scale! Ev'n Strelitz people, who in eating shine, Not quite like thee with heavy loads regale. Yet not to Strelitz be deny'd applause: Wide are their mouths, and sack-like are their maws. Yet if resolv'd to live with queens and kings; While meat and drink are such expensive things; Pull out thy stomach, cut away thy snout, And try, poor fellow, try to live without. THE SORROWS OF SUNDAY: AN ELEGY.The intended Annihilation of Sunday's harmless Amusements, by three or four most outrageously-zealous Members of Parliament, gave Birth to the following Elegy. The Hint is borrowed from a small Composition, entitled ‘The Tears of Old May Day.’ Mild was the breath of morn: the blushing sky Receiv'd the lusty youth with golden hair, Rejoicing in his race, to run, to fly; As Scripture says, ‘a bridegroom débonnaire;’ When, full of fears, the decent Sunday rose, And wander'd sad on Kensington's fair green: Down in a chair she sunk with all her woes, And touch'd, with tenderest sympathy, the scene. ‘O hard Sir Richard Hill!’ exclaim'd the dame; ‘Sir William Dolben, cruel man,’ quoth she; ‘And Mister Wilberforce, for shame! for shame! To spoil my little weekly jubilee. ‘Ah! pleas'd am I the humble folk to view, Enjoying harmless talk, and sport, and jest; Amid these walks their footsteps to pursue, To see them smiling, and so trimly drest. ‘Since the Lord rested on the seventh day, Which showeth that Omnipotence was tir'd; As Moses, in old times; was pleas'd to say, (And Moses was most certainly inspir'd); ‘Why should not man too rest?’ ‘No!’ cries Sir Dick: ‘At brother Rowland's let him knock his knees, Pray, sweat, and groan; of this damn'd world be sick; Of mangy morals crack the lice and fleas; ‘Break Sin's vile bones—pull Satan by the nose; Scrub, with the soap and sand of grace, the soul; Give Unbelief, the wretch, a rat's-bane dose; And stop, with malkins of rich faith, each hole: ‘Spit in foul Drunkenness's beastly mug; Kill with sharp prayers, each offspring of the Devil; Give to black Blasphemy, a Cornish hug; And box, with bats of grace, the ears of Evil.’ Susan, the constant slave to mop and broom; And Marian, to the spit's and kettle's art; Ah! shall not they desert the house's gloom, Breathe the fresh air one moment, and look smart? Meet, in some rural scene, a Colin's smile; With love's soft stories, wing the happy hour; Drop in his dear embraces from the stile, And share his kisses in the shady bow'r? ‘No!’ roars the Huntingtonian Priest—‘No, no! Lovers are liars—Love's a damned trade; Kissing is damnable—to Hell they go— The Devil's claws await the rogue and jade. My chapel is the purifying place: There let them go to wash their sins away: There, from my hand, to pick the crumbs of grace, Smite their poor sinful craws, and howl, and pray.’ How hard, the lab'ring hands no rest should know, But toil six days beneath the galling load, Poor souls! and then, the seventh be forc'd to go And box the Devil, in Blackfriar's Road The place of Mr. Rowland Hill's chapel.! Heav'n glorieth not in phizzes of dismay; Heav'n takes no pleasure in perpetual sobbing; Consenting freely, that my fav'rite day May have her tea and rolls, and hob and nobbing. In sooth, the Lord is pleas'd, when man is blest; And wisheth not his blisses to blockade: 'Gainst tea and coffee ne'er did he protest, Enjoy'd, in gardens, by the men of trade. Sweet is White-Conduit House, and Bagnigge Wells; Chalk-Farm, where Primrose-Hill puts forth her smile; And Don Saltero's, where much wonder dwells, Expelling work-day's matrimonial bile. Life with the down of cygnets may be clad! Ah! why not make her path a pleasant track? ‘No!’ cries the Pulpit Terrorist (how mad!) ‘No! let the world be one huge hedgehog's back. Vice (did his rigid mummery succeed) Too soon would smile amid the sacred walls; Venus, in tabernacles, make her bed; And Paphos find herself amid Saint Paul's. Avaunt Hypocrisy, the solemn jade, Who, wilful, into ditches leads the blind: Makes, of her canting art, a thriving trade, And fattens on the follies of mankind! Look at archbishops, bishops, on a fast, Denying hackney-coachmen ev'n their beer; Yet, lo! their butchers knock, with flesh repast; With turbots, lo! the fishmongers appear! The pot-boys howl with porter for their bellies; The bakers knock, with custards, tarts, and pies; Confectioners, with rare ice creams and jellies; The fruiterer, lo, with richest pine supplies! In secret, thus, they eat, and booze, and nod; In public call indulgence a d?mn'd evil; Order their simple flocks to walk with God, And ride themselves an airing with the Devil. THE CONVENTION BILL; AN ODE. Odi profanum vulgus, et arceo— Favete linguis. HOR. I hate the mob—Avaunt the vulgar throng! Be padlocks plac'd on ev'ry Briton's tongue. PITT'S TRANSLATION. TO THE READER. GENTLE READER, The insufferable licentiousness of the present age, with regard to political opinion, demands an immediate redress. As a freedom of discussion may be the loss of a minister's place; that minister is in the right to make use of his most virtuous majority, to bring in a bill For binding to the peace the tongue and pen, So hostile to the peace of courtier men, who, as Pope says of his friend Addison, —‘damn for arts that caus'd themselves to rise.’ Messieurs Pitt and Dundas were not pot valiant when they stumbled on this Convention Act, whatever the world may think. The jolly god, it is said. was for once forced to give place to the goddess yclept Prudence, who has totally presided over this bill, which wisely orders that a dozen men, like a dozen bottles of wine, shall not pass from house to house without a permit. Convinced of the necessity and wisdom of our premier's political manœuvre, I join his standard, and heartily vote to perpetual confinement the pen. That, with its lever nib of brass, Tries from his pow'r to heave Dundas; And tongue that, with its crushing wit, Treads like an elephant, on Pitt, By Slander urg'd, whose breath of flame Melts the fair column of a name. P. P. THE CONVENTION BILL; ODE TO MR. PITT. Accept a convert, ode-composing Peter! The thunder-bearing bird of British metre!’ Says Fame, from truth not often known to wander: To thee Job's war-horse from Parnassus, Pitt, A gentle beast, I kneeling take the bit, Like tam'd Bucephalus to Alexander; A horse to other riders so uncivil; Who rear'd, and plung'd, and kick'd them to the Devil. Since Impudence, assuming Freedom's form, Near Mother Red-cap brews the dangerous storm, Assembling such a formidable rout; Loud threat'ning, too, O Pitt! in evil hour To blow thee, like the gossamer, from pow'r; 'Tis time, full time, methinks, to look about. Say the full plan thou meanest to pursue, To curb of liberty this upstart crew: Our eyes are, hawk-like, on the sharpen'd gaze. Pronounce how many men shall meet together, To canvass our political foul weather, And shake their heads, in hopes of better days. If not too pert—Thou great reforming man, How many wilt thou suffer in a clan, To groan their grievance, whisper woful tale, Where the small tap-room pours its gin and ale? Sedition lurks within a porter-mug— Eke in a glass of gin the knave lies snug! Who drinks, in rank rebellion dips his nose! I like not healths! too oft they carry treason: Then let us cut at once the rascal's weasand, That dares to drink ‘a rope to freedom's foes!’ And if to news-papers thou turn'st thine eyes, Hot-beads of treason upon treason rise, Save Rose's—guiltless of all wit-pollution! But, if sheer heaviness can aid a cause, George's two brats Mr. George Rose, of the Treasury, is the proprietor of two newspapers, misnomered the True Briton and Sun: the first, pleasantly fabulous; and the last, never emitting a single ray. They are intended, however, as two brazen pillars of our happy constitution, acquainting the world with every motion of majesty. George is really a character, and should be brought a little more forward on the political canvass. To continue the metaphor, this treasury gentleman has been kept too far in the back ground. A history of his life, parentage, and education, would prove a bonne bouche for the public. shall pound the people's jaws, As logs and lead do wondrous execution. Rebellion taints a whisper, too, I think, And wondrous danger hides within a wink; Much in a shrug, and much in lifted eyes; But, if a groan escape, a monarch dies. Augustus acted very sagely—for as He lov'd two poets, Virgil call'd, and Horace, He issued proclamation, where, quoth he, ‘Let no one poet, upon pain of death (And, Lord! how dangerous that same loss of breath!) ‘Dare, if he values life, to mention me.’ It had a very fine effect, says Fame; Ev'n cats and puppies reverenc'd Cæsar's name! Thus let our Cæsar mounted be on high, And no one take his name in vain, but Pye. Behold the pale Chinese! tame slaves of pow'r, Who, at a Mandarin, in corners cow'r, Dropping to earth the eye with awe-clad head; While others yield themselves to panting flight, Not vent'ring to turn back the fearful sight, Lest a huge blunderbuss should strike them dead! Such souls in Britons may we hope to see? Haste, haste, the times to tremble thus at thee! Oh! as in Norman William's humbling day, At eve, shall solemn curfews sound the knell; And men, like babes, be forc'd to bed away, Soon as they hear the monitory bell? When Majesty to Parliament shall ride, Ah! may the monarch by the mob be eye'd? And, if allow'd the blessing of a view, Whether with half an eye, one eye, or two? And will it not be deem'd a daring thing To ogle through a spying-glass the king? And will not Reeve's scouts to Justice run, And swear the spying-glass a monstrous gun? By the sage counsel, possibly alone, Like Dame Godiva, George may travel on, When, lo, of curiosity a head, A peeping Tom, may from a window poke; Then let the bullet or the sabre's stroke Dismiss the saucy peeper to the dead. And, since his majesty is fond of hunting, Ah, let his company no more be bunting! A sweep may bear a very dangerous brush; Butchers may pull a cleaver from the frock; Barbers may launch at majesty a block, Or bason dart, or pike-like pole may push; Jack Ketch within his pocket hide his string, And cobblers launch their lap-stones at their king; Since such too often, by ambition borne, Join majesty, and whoop, and bound, and horn! And, when our king to Weymouth shall repair, Forget not thou an order to the may'r, When in the tub the royal life embarks, To read the riot-act to shrimps and sharks! And now may God your hearts, ye Britons, turn! Your sins in sack-cloth and in ashes mourn: Without a sigh, to ministers submit— Ye are but children yet, so mend your ways; Sing to the lord (th' Exchequer's lord!) with praise; And go to school, good boys, to Goody Pitt. But hark! a voice!—‘Ah, Pitt! thine arts are vain; Britons dare speak, and, when oppress'd, complain; To man the little privilege is giv'n: And, should a miscreant curb it (dead to shame), May Albion's genius tear the villain's frame, And fling it piece-meal to the fowls of Heav'n!’ Whence is that solemn sound, alas! declare: The ghost of Alfred bids a rogue beware. ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-SIX; A SATIRE; IN TWO DIALOGUES. Singula de nobis anni prædantur euntes Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum, Tendunt extorquere poëmata—quid faciam vis? HORACE, ARS POET. Pitt claps his paws on something ev'ry day; A hiss at royalty—a poor old play; Meetings near Mother Redcap's (harmless things!), Jokes on court-mummery, smiles at queens and kings; Ere long, he leaps on Peter's dove-like strains; And should the Muse be ravish'd, what remains? DIALOGUE I. PETER. Ah, Tom! from Alma Mater? TOM. Just imported, Fortune a jade, and ev'ry guinea sported. PETER. What! no rich father then has slipp'd his wind, And left a hogshead of bank-notes behind? No good Aunt Grizzle, kind enough to die, Left a long purse to sooth the mournful sigh, And purchase Pleasure's pretty recreations? TOM. I meet with no such kindness from relations! P?x on't, it now appears their cruel plan To live as long and happy as they can; To make their sons in slavery watch and pray, Till time and disappointment turn them gray! PETER. True, Tom—when lively lads arrive at age Dull fathers should be hustled off the stage, And mothers (hiss'd to Heav'n to find employ) Yield up their jointures to oblige their boy. Sons with less ceremony us'd to treat 'em— Tied them to trees, for wolves to come and eat 'em: Are parents old, with any thing to give? 'Tis really sin and impudence to live: Gold should change hands—not sleep amid the chest: Ye gods, for guineas what inglorious rest! Gold on Newmarket's panting steed should fly, And briskly circle with the rattling die. TOM. Friendship: where art? in books and on the tongue; Who mak'st, like love, a very pretty song: Too much a stranger to the heart, I ween! Like angels, prais'd, admir'd—but seldom seen! Besides myself, no comforter have I! No hopes from parents, and no friend to die. Sweet friendship ev'n for animals I love— A dog, a cat, a monkey, parrot, dove; With Alexander's spirit charm'd, of course, Who built a town The city of Bucephalus. in honour of his horse. PETER. Now for the meaning of thy wild-goose chase: What project, Tom? a pension, or a place? TOM. Full of my mighty self, from college down I rush, to blaze a comet on the town! To tear from Slavery's neck the galling chain, And raise a nabob-fortune by my brain; On skins of hungry wolves, the courtiers, thrive, A Nimrod! leaving not a beast alive! Tremble thou Richmond, Hawk'sb'ry, and thou Pitt Too tremble, at the falchion of my wit. Tremble thou Portland, Malmsb'ry, Rose, Dundas! Stripp'd be the lion's hide, that holds an ass. Roll my deep thunder round that Reeves's head, Dark form! that stalking strikes a world with dread: All eye, all ear, at midnight's guardless hour, To seize a subject for the jail or Tow'r. Arm'd with the lightning's pointed fire, my pen,, Brand thou the daring fronts of shameless men; Drag thou, my arm, black Guilt to open day!— Such are my projects!—how d'ye like them, pray? PETER. Nobly resolv'd! a pious resolution, Would Fortune kindly crown the execution. But Pitt despis'd the execrating noise Of men and women—hooting girls and boys! Smil'd at the rude salutes of stones and mire That discompos'd his curls and gay attire; And fated, had he fall'n, his gang to cross, Pitt knew a simple life no public loss; Knew that a name but mock'd a vengeful stone, Whose ghost-like popularity was gone; And knew, his flow'rs of speech and breadth of soul The state might find in many a dirty hole. Safe 'mid the windings of his brazen tow'r, Too well a minister discerns his pow'r; With high contempt he bids their fury flow, And mocks the pop-guns of the world below: So deep in fat Corruption's soil his roots, The public blast but lops some wanton shoots; The bullying trunk, whose members brave the skies, Firm in its hell-clad strength, the storm defies. TOM. I'll pour a broadside into courts.— PETER. Forbear. Court-folly charms, of all, the eye and ear: Sink it, and Satire mourns his useless dart; While Ridicule, a bankrupt, breaks his heart. TOM. I'll spread my sentiments of kings and queens; Truth guides my pen, and Truth the poet screens. PETER. Oh! what an inexperienc'd thing is youth! How very little knowest thou of Truth! Truth for a very dangerous dame believe! Too often, Tom, the fairest forms deceive: Mid Winter's shiv'ring scene the simple hare Finds in the purest snow a fatal snare: Forth as she scuds, to feed at early day, The treach'rous softness tells her winding way: Where'er it feels her feet, the fair betrayer, Informs the treach'rous poacher where to slay her. The muse that tells plain truth, with edge-tools sports: Go, deal in fiction, man, and flatter courts. TOM. Nor shall the pompous lawn my lash escape, That swelling lords it over simple crape: Whales of the church, before my vengeance fly— Devouring, mangling the poor helpless fry: Priests! how unlike your healing, humble master! He, Gilead's balm; but you—a blister-plaster! Out with state-cancers! caustic, come, and knife— I'll gain Fame's plaudit, though I lose my life. PETER. Sweet is her song—divine, like Banti's breath; Yet dear's the ballad, Tom, whose note is death! TOM. Perchance I venture on the hope-forlorn! Yet, he who Honour courts, must Danger scorn! PETER. Thus, when a breach is made in some fair town, The volunteers, agog to gain renown, Beg hard to enter first, to fall with glory, And give Posterity a beauteous story; While wiser some, averse to making mould, Would rather tell the tale, than have it told. TOM. I'll pierce of Wimbledon the midnight scene, Where taxes spring, and Riot's orgies reign; Expose the two Dictators to the isle— PETER. The world has mark'd them, and the couple smile. TOM. What! is there not a blush?—a little glow, To stain their marble countenances? PETER. No! The minister who bears a blushing face, Poor Molly! is not fitted for his place. With dog-like impudence, and dog-like stare, To wonder, all the while he lays the snare, ‘That gentlemen suspect a harmless plan;’ Such is the minister, and such the man, To dupe the state, and carry all before him!— TOM. So, then, my bull of satire cannot gore him? PETER. At ev'ry push the man would only laugh, And prove thy bellowing bull, a whining calf. Rose, spite of ridicule, enjoys his place, And grins at such as damn the want of grace; While Wyndham, unabash'd, his heart unlocks, And calmly meets the front of injur'd Fox. One monosyllable, whose name is Aye, Weighs more than all a hundred bards can say: One daring member of a rotten borough Is found of late, to poor Old England's sorrow, Full strong to give fair Freedom her death-wound, And hurl her heav'n-clad column to the ground. Merit may walk to grass, or munch the thistle: For Pitt, the Virtues all may e'vn go whistle. Worth, like the worm beneath the cold hard stone, Crawls forth, and courts the sunshine of a throne: But, lo, its rays on diff'rent reptiles fall, That wriggling, clinging, lick the foot of Baal. TOM. Portland shall feel my scourge— PETER. Why so, poor man? His grace is much the best of all the clan. Though dup'd to join with knaves his luckless doom, 'Mid rooks, a pigeon with unsullied plume: His colleagues, when compar'd to him!—a day Of wolf-like Winter, and the lamb-like May; The lane's coarse pebble, and Golconda's stone; The Medicean Venus, and a Joan. His and their hearts are opposition things; Diff'rent as dove-like saints, and vulture kings; Cynthia, the world's delight, and Lady Mary; Fam'd Belisarius, and old Bamfylde Cary. TOM. Die then the embassy that shames the land. PETER. Lord! Tom, the French have kill'd it to thy hand; Then rein thy fury—spare thy idle breath— TOM. I'll fabricate the poetry of Death. O'er many a neck my scimitar shall flame, And Havoc's corses form my road to fame; On Satire's burning coals this villain fries, And roasted that with skewers in his eyes: I'll match the knaves with tortures of all sorts, And make a charming little hell for courts. PETER. Heavn's! Tom, be cooler; take advice— TOM. I won't— ‘Wilful will do't'—my soul is fix'd upon't, Ah, Peter, you're a courtier. PETER. No such thing: I never drank at Adulation's spring. TOM. No! Peter never dealt in praise! PETER. I have. There is a time ere any man's a knave— Some start in youth, some sin at bald fourscore; But known—the voice of Fame is heard no more. Virtue's pure robe with dirt I scorn to load, Or offer incense to embalm a toad. True, I have flatter'd—yes, my raptur'd tongue Has pleas'd a mistress oft—and oft a song: Yet for no baseness I invok'd the Nine— A lovely subject, and a harmless line. Let talents, virtues, meet my happy eyes; I ask not, truly, from what soil they rise. If 'mid the lorn cold vale of Want they spring, The muse shall hen-like spread her fost'ring wing; Or Grandeur's sun-clad mountain, to their glory, My verse (though scarce believ'd) shall tell the story: Give me the riches, and I'll find the soul To lead poor pining Merit from her hole. Friend to the arts, where George's millions mine, What heav'nly maid in poverty should pine? For lab'ring Genius, palaces should rise; Not for court-sycophants, the carrion-flies: These would I flap—and change at once the scene; To Taste, the Attic nymph, restore her reign; With Raphaels, Titians, the glad world renew, And lead a second Angelo to view; Bid, for our Board of Works, Palladios spring, And cast a ray of glory round a king. And, were I king! I solemnly protest, That hardware-man, that brazier, Mister West, No more should copper poor old Windsor's walls; Nor Bacon's lifeless lumber Two statues intended to adorn St. Paul's cathedral, and challenge the universe for sculpture. They are said to be meant for Howard and Johnson. Much money has been given for digging the two miserable objects out of the stone, and they have been put up: when will the poor exposed figures, for the honour of our national taste, and their own credit, be taken down? —Risum teneatis, amici? load Saint Paul's. Then should yon nick-nam'd dome How the Academy came to be baptized royal, I cannot conceive; as not a spangle of royal munificence ever threw a ray around its walls. Had it not been for the annual shillings of the charitable public, it must have died of famine long ago. (alas! how poor In real merit!) shut its sacred door On smugglers in the trade, whom art reviles; Whose sole pretensions are—what? Folly's smiles. Yet, is there one, whose bags with wealth run o'er, Who loves the arts, and loves to see them poor; Proud of a lying, cringing dedication, That dubs him the Mæcenas of the nation? Lo, there are authors to proclaim his spirit, And swear it ever in pursuit of merit. TOM. Curs'd be the period, whether verse or prose, That round a worthless head a glory throws— Yields Merit's meed to tinsel stars and strings, And soul to Mis'ry, though it dwelt with kings. Makes Av'rice generous—the poor idiot wise— And lifts the fool of fortune to the skies. PETER. Yet are there knaves in these unblushing days, To fabricate the lying song of praise! What's strange—the flatter'd fools, so dead to shame, Strut in stol'n plumes, and boast th' imputed fame. Tell Knight A gentleman who scrambled to Parnassus as he crept into the borough of Ludlow; and who, obtaining the alms of charity from a reviewer, informs the world that it is the free and unsolicited donation of Fame. A gentleman who fancies his poor cracked post-horn to be the trump of heroic poetry; and, ashamed of being a contemptible mute amidst his brethren of St. Stephen's, turns a roaring bully amongst the Muses. Possessed of a school-boy power of mouthing a few Greek polysyllables, who most ridiculously deems himself an Aristarchus; and who, childishly arrogating to himself the character of a legislator of taste in landscape-scenery, has received a severe and merited castigation, from men of real abilities, for his presumption. he beats, in rural scenes, the world; Nought for the falsehood at your head is hurl'd! Say that he feels a poet's genuine fire, His palsied hand like Milton's sweeps the lyre: Not Flatt'ry's self can too much fame allow; For, lo, to Phœbus self he scorns to bow. Swear Taste a poor lost sheep before he came; At once he hears Messiah in his name: He sees the poor fall'n creature Taste restor'd; And, proud of vict'ry, feels himself the Lord! Say Wisdom languish'd in barbaric gloom; He sees his Genius the wild waste illume. PETER. Thus, when a night of shade involves the pole, And clouds on clouds in murky masses roll; Sol through the darkness bids his radiance flow, And robes with golden light the world below! TOM. Call Mason, Shakespeare; Mister Hayley, Pope; Their jaws with sudden inspiration ope; With fancied immortality they shine, And all Parnassus thunders through their line: No more the Muses their lost fav'rites mourn; In Mason's, Hayley's page again they burn! Tell Banks he fills with honour Newton's chair, The weed-and-bird's-nest-hunter will not stare! Aloud with Newton's fancied pow'rs he brays, And struts with Newton down to distant days! Call West, Corregio; on his cloth display'd, Raptur'd he marks a breadth of light and shade; His copper turns to flesh of loveliest hue, And ev'ry cherub-sweetness charms his view. Or grant him Raphael's line and Raphael's grace, He will not fling his brushes in your face: Pronounce like matchless Claude's his landscape clear, He sees the brightest clouds, the purest sphere; Surveys Dame Nature's forms with thrilling blood, And counts a thousand leagues along the mud. Inform that witch—of ugliness the queen, Old Sycorax, she beats in mind and mien Fair Oxford; how the wrinkled bag will smile, And stretch her approbation-mouth a mile! Call Porteus gen'rous Her majesty's own bishop, the œconomical Bishop of London; who, on his exaltation, sent circular letters to the clergy of his diocese, commanding them to inform him of the state of morality, religion, and the churches; at the same time, however, requesting, that the answers might not weigh more than one ounce. Poor morality, poor religion, poor churches! What! not worth the postage of a letter?, Porteus will not cry, With hands uplifted, ‘Jesu, what a lie!’ No! on his lip a smile approving springs, Sweet as the simper when be bows to kings. Praise Strelitz, Schwellenberg will scream, ‘Mine Gote, England haf noting clevers as dat spote; Dere be de palace!—peepels of high bert, An bestest princes dat's in all de ert.’ Praise Bru?ll's brain—what farce! the man receives it! Swear that his head is human—he believes it: Swear B?ll?r honours the huge wig and gown, By heav'ns, the fellow will not knock you down; Nor turncoat W?m, to no party true, Deny sincerity to be his due. Praise Hawkesb'ry for his sweet ingenuous heart, The man has not the decency to start: Call Grenville humble—will you shock the peer? No, no! he listens with unwounded ear: Chatham, in naval matters, brisk and deep; He drops the tortoise, and forgets his sleep. Tell Pitt, the people love him—Pitt will smile, And deem himself the fav'rite of the isle: Swear modesty no stranger to Dundas, Hal feels the virtue on his front of brass. PETER. Thus, should Sir Isaac Sir Isaac Heard, garter king at arms. (meanness to promote) Form for some upstart wretch a handsome coat; Lo, from the Conquest, lists of sires appear, And all the puddle of his blood runs clear. DIALOGUE II. TOM. O! for the soul of Leo, to inspire Our future kings with Glory's genuine fire! Then would the happy painter, and the bard, Of simple merit reap the rare reward! Then would the varied field of letters bloom, Smile on the eye, and yield the heav'ns perfume. PETER. Poor field! at present much like Hounslow Heath The comparison of the present barren field of literature to the field of gibbets is new, apposite, and ingenious. Literature now is as dangerous as murder. Let Reeves be the interpreter, and every line of every pamphlet, verse or prose, shall, by this gentleman's sagacious commentary, smell of treason as strongly as the whisper of an anti-Pittite proclaims rebellion.—The editor., Whose chief production is the wood of Death. TOM. How is fair Art, and Science, in disgrace! What patron meets them with a smiling face? See, like a shadow, Genius, limping, poor, In supplication at a great man's door!— And see with insolence his lacquey treat him; And were he fat enough, the dog would eat him. PETER. O Taste, O Reason, to our isle return! Behold our great for littlenesses burn! Charm'd with his wit, and tricks, and nose, and hunch, Not long ago, Lord Plymouth purchas'd Punch: And very soon, I ween, some titled ninny, Some moon-ey'd fool, will buy the Fantoccini. Th' alarming voice of war must not be heard— There are no French to pull us by the beard— Invasions! nonsense—What the pow'r of France; What discord, murder, so the puppets dance? TOM. This reddens my rough vengeance—fans my flame, And goads my Satire's hawk to seek its game. Yes! yes! I stand resolv'd upon the matter— Fry is the word, and brimstone be my batter! PETER. Gods! what a furious Saracen art thou! But what says Pitt? will Pitt thy rage allow? Believe me, Tom, the blunderbuss of law Makes a long shot—an engine form'd to awe— By this has many a bird of Satire bled— Be prudent, therefore, and revere the leud. Think of thy banish'd namesake! TOM. What! Tom Paine? I like the man—should boast to hold his train: Tom Paine speaks boldly out; and so I dare Strike at court slaves, nor sex nor order spare; Spread o'er my quarry Vice, my eagle wings, Nor dread the conflict, though oppos'd by kings! PETER. Lo, that rich hour of Liberty gone by! Grenville's and Pitt's bold acts thy rage defy: Pitt claps his paws on something ev'ry day; A hiss at royalty, a poor old play Venice Preserved; condemned by authority to oblivion, on account of the numerous and violent plaudits bestowed on passages that seemed direct sarcasms on our present rulers., Meetings near Mother Redcap's (harmless things!), Jokes on court-mummery, smiles at queens and kings: Ere long he leaps on Peter's dove-like strains; And should the muse be ravish'd, what remains? Behold the court, of hist'ry grown so sore, I scarce dare mention—apple-dumpling more, Or Madam Schwellenberg and ambling jack The ass on which the great mistress of the robes was wont to take her airings, for health, through the royal gardens, which furnished much misfortune and amusement., For fear the palace might be on my back; And that's a heavy-load, the world will own, Enough to make the mighty Atlas groan: Nor Whitbread's brewhouse, nor poor Mother Jones, Nor hunting parsons, if I prize my bones; Louse, Brick-kiln, Gard'ners, Mutton, Mouse-trap, Tour; Such mention will not ministers endure: Though ministers, as blushing hist'ry shows, Dar'd pull a goodly monarch by the nose; Spat in his face, and threaten'd to dethrone him; Roar'd out ‘Reform,’ and forc'd themselves upon him: Drunk with successes, seiz'd the old state thunder, When uproar wild began, and nation-plunder. The ‘state's in danger,’ louder howl'd the storm, Gagg'd ev'ry raven-mouth that croak'd ‘reform.’ Thus then it happens (save good Master Reeves), The purest patriots may be pick'd from thieves. PETER. For ever sacred be the acts of kings, The founts of worship, honour, stars and strings! Ev'n such as Virtue damns, the gentle muse (So chang'd her nature?) shall not once abuse: Peace to the ghost of Nero, great good man, Beneath whose blade no blood in rivers ran! Whose heart in Mercy's tender mould was made! Peace to Domitian's—peace to Richard's shade! TOM. Who is this lord high-paramount, this Pitt? What are his mighty acts, his wisdom, wit? What his huge feats, with all his wondrous brags? The nation stripp'd, fair Liberty in rags, With scarce a shift, gown, stocking, garter, sandal; Put up at Garraway's by inch of candle. A booby who for vict'ries madly gapes, And idly lab'ring brings us into scrapes; Then bids us get ourselves, with phiz devout, And fear and trembling, pray'r, and starving, out! Thus, with an insolence a name that lacks, He flings his own d?mn'd sins upon our backs. Poor England! to destruction he has brought it; Then cries with idiot wonder, ‘Who'd have thought it!’ Away with fasts that gormandise and quaff, And give ev'n sly Hypocrisy a laugh! Who will with lying impudence declare, Nought fills his mouth upon that day, but air? What saints the stomach's pinches will endure? None!—save their pious majesties, I'm sure. But grant we fast—are fasts of aught avail? Behold the poor with fasting lean and pale; And still the French, in lucky war employ'd, Unlike Sennach'rib's host, are not destroy'd. PETER. But, Tom, 'tis gentry that must Heav'n implore; G?d never listens to the ragged poor. When ministers their blundering tricks betray, 'Tis gentry only that must starve and pray. Yet at their dread petition Heav'n will start, Nor, cruel, run a Frenchman through the heart, T'oblige a foolish Briton who shall cry, I'm fasting, Lord; so let thy vengeance fly: So far am I a quaker, I must own, And dare not thus address th' eternal throne. Heav'n is most merciful—inclin'd to spare, And scorns to kill a neighbour for a pray'r. Indeed, whate'er the bishops may pretend, In fast and pray'r we seldom find a friend: Fasts will not wet French powder; nor will words Of pious imprecation blunt French swords: Nor sighs of saints avert the flying ball: The pope must run from Rome, and Mantua fall. TOM. How at each solemn phiz the Dev'l must grin! All sanctity without, and fraud within! But pray'rs before a bishop, and a haunch; Alas! he quits not, for the soul, the paunch: Meat must be watch'd, and roasted in its prime; Pray'rs for the Lord keep cold for any time. PETER. Thus, on a Sunday, pious Parson Moss At a late assizes at Wells, at the Cathedral, this ludicrous affair happened., Afraid a tiger-appetite to cross, Left out good pray'rs, and stopp'd the organ's tongue, That groaning meditated heav'nly song: For, lo, too soon (to disappoint the Lord) The judges' ven'son smoak'd upon the board! Who can resist, when appetite feels bold? And what divine would eat his ven'son cold? TOM. Well, since we must have this same idle day, Shut up the shops, look dismal, starve, and pray; O give the Litany this supplication, ‘Lord, kick two scoundrels from administration!’ PETER. Fie, fie, Tom—really you are too severe. TOM. Who with a velvet lash would flog a bear? PETER. Come, come—some merit must to Pitt belong— TOM. I grant him perseverance—grant him tongue. With words I own the fellow well supplied, Bombast, and phrases ready cut and dried; A formal, scowling, wisdom-aping face; An awkward gesture, an affected grace: Cavil and flimsy logic, to surprise, And raise the whites of country members' eyes.’ When dead, what leaves this Pitt to light mankind? Not the dim lustre of a snail, behind! Grant from his dust the world one ray may pick; What is't?—the glimmer of a rotten stick! What has Pitt done for subject or for prince? PETER. Good heav'ns, I've said it, scarce a minute since! Of screech-owl Satire, Pitt has shorn the wings, That hooting hover'd round the thrones of kings; Where, from the rising to the setting ray, Now soothing Flatt'ry pours the lark-like ray; Where simp'ring courtiers buz with praiseful tongue, Like gnats that hum to parting suns the song. Friend to the state, with soldier, and with tar, Pitt fights our just and necessary war; Improves our taxes, what would he have more? And sets an honest spy at ev'ry door. TOM. For shame!—by ridicule you ward each stroke, And make the ruin of the state a joke; Who from Dame Justice snatch'd the bloodhound—? 'Tis Pitt compassionates, 'tis Pitt reprieves: Caught in the trap, the dark informer roar'd, Till Pitt the wretch to liberty restor'd. PETER. Thus, if we may compare great things with small, When Doctor Johnson When Johnson lodged at Kettle Hall, in the University of Oxford, at a Mr. Thompson's, a cabinet-maker; the maid, by an unfortunate mistake, brought him one day a chemise of Mrs. Thompson's to put on, instead of his own shirt. Contemplating on nothing but Ramblers and Idlers, and colossal Dictionaries, he shoved his arms and head and shoulders into the lady's linen before he discovered his error. ‘Who has cut off the sleeves of my shirt? who has cut off the sleeves of my shirt?’ exclaimed the enraged and hampered moralist, with Stentorian vociferation, dancing and tugging and foaming for freedom.—This roar brought up poor trembling Mrs. Thompson, who, with the most consummate delicacy, shutting her two chaste eyes, slipped her hand into the room, and delivered her giant guest from his enchanted castle. lodg'd at Kettle Hall, His philosophic consequence to shock, Fate bade him put on Mistress Thompson's smock; Wedg'd in the smock (a lion in the toil), He roar'd, and kick'd, and sweated—huge turmoil! Stamp'd, bounc'd, and ran a buffalo about, Till Mistress Thompson let the savage out. TOM. Misplac'd indeed is all your ridicule, That means to thwart my plans by calling fool. PETER. Thus, when the president of frogs and flies, And weeds and birds'-nests, wish'd in pomp to rise, And fill (himself) a throne It is an incontrovertible fact that Sir Joseph Banks proposed the plan of a throne for himself, and benches for foreign princes and ambassadors beneath him, whose heads might be on the same plane with the most noble president's ten toes. Dr. Horsley, the present bishop of Rochester, by a well-timed ridicule, put an end to the vision of vanity. sublime and fair, And give his hammer'd arm a Jove-like air; Th' uncourtly Doctor, hostile to the scheme, Gave a loud horse-laugh, and dissolv'd the dream! TOM. Still with more irony?—But I'll go on— Who with calm spirit sees the realm undone? Who from the noble haunches of the state Cuts fine fat slices for his dainty plate, And bids the people on the offals feed? This fellow Pitt! PETER. —A crying sin indeed! Thus saw I once a cuckoo in a cage, And thrush, a very purser of the age! Boil'd beef, and cabbage, had the pair for dinner; When, lo, the thrush (a knowing purser-sinner), Soon as he met a bit of beef, the elf Sans cérémonie gobbled it himself: But when a stump of cabbage!—chang'd his note, He ramm'd it down the gaping cuckoo's throat. TOM. Behold the barracks, and our lot deplore; Ere long a damn'd dragoon at ev'ry door! Then, lo, fair Freedom dead, who holds his hate, Forc'd by a fascination to her fate! PETER. Thus when the wily snake, beneath a tree, Darts his red eyes upon his feather'd prey; Poor bird! no more he swells the song of love, Waves the wild wing, and glides from grove to grove: With panting heart he tries to shun the foe; But, looking on the steady fiend below, In chains of fatal fascination bound, Captive he hops around him and around; Till nearer, nearer drawn, with hopeless cries, He drops upon the poison'd fang, and dies. TOM. So, then, you laugh at hopes of reformation? PETER. Pitt finds a tame old hack in our good nation; Safe, through the dirt, and ev'ry dangerous road, The beast consents to bear his galling load; And, spite of all that we can sing or say, Fools will be fools, and ministers—betray. LIBERTY'S LAST SQUEAK; CONTAINING AN ELEGIAC BALLAD, AN ODE TO AN INFORMER—AN ODE TO JURYMEN—AND CRUMBS OF COMFORT FOR THE GRAND INFORMER. Now farewel to fair Buckingham-House; To Windsor, to Richmond, and Kew; Farewel to the tale of the Louse! Mother Red-cap, and Monarchs, adieu! LIBERTY'S LAST SQUEAK; AN ELEGIAC BALLAD. Farewel, O my pen and my tongue! To part with such friends I am loath; But Pitt, in majorities strong, Voweth horrible vengeance on both. No more on a king or a queen, Apple-dumpling, and smuggling so sweet; Like their stomachs your wit shall be keen, Hogs, hay, and fat bullocks, and wheat. No more upon smugglers at court, Mother Schwellenberg, bulses, and shawls; Nor at levees and drawing-rooms sport, Where man the poor sycophant crawls. The meanness no more of high folk In the rope of your satire shall swing; For, behold, there is death in the joke That squinteth at queen or at king. Thus untax'd by your satire, my friends, Courts smile at th' intended decree; Thus the reign of poor ridicule ends, And follies, like shawls, will go free. Yes, Folly will prattle and grin With her scourges Oppression will rise, Since satire's a damnable sin, And a sin to be virtuous and wise. But wherefore not laugh at a?? And wherefore not laugh at a?? A laugh is a laudable thing, When people are silly and mean. When we paid civil list without strife, When we paid the old quack for his cure, When we pray'd at Peg Nicholson's knife, The k?laughed at us, to be sure. Ev'n the minions of courts will escape; Dundas, Pitt, and Jenky, and Rose, Yes, Satire gets into a scrape, If she takes the four R?s by the nose. No more must ye laugh at an ass; No more run on topers a rig, Since Pitt gets as drunk as Dundas, And Dundas gets as drunk as a pig. A laugh at a delegate hurts; Yes, 'twere dangerous to hazard your sneers; And mock the sweet mercy of courts, That return'd him his forfeited ears. Now farewel to fair Buckingham-house, To Windsor, and Richmond, and Kew; Farewel to the tale of the Louse! Mother Red-cap, and Monarchs adieu! Like ferrets, since all must be muzzled, (And muzzled indeed we shall be!) Say Pitt (for I'm grievously puzzled), May we venture a horse-laugh at thee? ODE TO AN INFORMER. Now is the time, my friend—'tis now or never— Help, help of government the bold endeavour; So lately through a deep consumption rubbing, Prerogative's upon his legs again! He wields his knotty club with might and main, For long the land has needed a sound drubbing! Prerogative, ye Gods! will soon look fierce, Hunt with his hounds the shops for prints and verse And find the likenesses of men on high— Make of the booksellers and bards a hash— Smell rank rebellion in a star or dash, And bid the sneering culprit hang or fly. Whoever mentions pig, or goose, or pens, Skim-milk, or corn, or man-traps, cocks, and hens, Or Frogmore Fête, or charities, or bulse, The turnkey soon shall feel the culprit's pulse. Whoever says that majesty is rich, Or calls Dame Schwellenberg a smuggling b?, Or swears hypocrisy has dwelt in courts, Blasphemes, speaks treason, and with edge tools sports. Who says of Wimbledon a slighting word, Where Pitt, the Punch of Showman Harry, steals To learn state-tricks, behold the vengeful sword O'ertaking soon the swiftest pair of heels! Who mentions Richmond's courage, or his coals, Must think upon the stock's ignoble holes. Whoever christens but his dog, Tom Paine (And many an itching tongue can scarce refrain), The cur and master shall be brought to shame— Nay, Tom, a common Christian name for cats, Must die; and lo, the Hanoverian rats Already lose the Hanoverian name. The name Tom Paine, should ev'n a parrot cry, Make out his mittimus, and let him die: Strike me that bulfinch on the jaw, That dares to warble ca ira. God save the king, the world must sing or say; God save the king, the ballad of the day! Our dogs shall learn of royalty to bawl, Our cats, from roof to roof, of Cæsar squall; The beetles buz with loyalty along— The very owl ‘God save the king!’ shall learn; And barn, at midnight, hoot to brother barn; And bat shall shriek to bat th' inspiring song. What journeyman will dare to mention wages? Who talk about the hardships of the poor? Off with the villains to their iron cages, Where whip-arm'd Justice guards the gloomy door. Ev'n on a royal horse, or sheep, or cur, Let subjects, if they dare it, cast a slur? All that a palace holdeth smells of God: A page's call is glory to our ears: A cook's salute a load of honour bears; Nay, honour dwelleth in a scullion's nod. Shoot all those grumbling rascals, the dissenters, And hang their hearts, like butchers meat, on tenters; Fellows that fain would be court gospel-makers: Impale the goat-fac'd, unbelieving Jews; And then the knife of Justice to amuse, Cut out the tongues of all the groaning quakers! Return, return, ye glorious days agen, When pow'r, the giant, muzzled tongue and pen; Saw what the soul was thinking, through the eye, And crush'd it for a treasonable sigh! The voice of Liberty has roar'd too long! Pull out the wide-mouth'd strumpet's lawless tongue! Off with the wonted crown that decks her head, And place the proper fool's-cap in its stead. SECOND ODE TO AN INFORMER. The great Poet inviteth a great Informer to great Wickedness! R?, let thy soul enjoy the hour! See Night her grisly spectres pour! The clock proclaims her at her highest noon; Lone silence shall our work befriend, Her shoes of cygnet down shall lend; The cloud's black mantle muffle the pale moon. Newgate to brother Tower shall roar aloud: ‘So thick the pris'ners my dark dwelling crowd, I cannot put a pin between the knaves; ‘And glutted too, am I, and I, and I.’ The Tow'r and echoing jails around reply— ‘And I, and I,’ each loaded compter raves. The sated pillory shall roar: ‘I'm tir'd, I'm tir'd—can squeeze no more.’ The gibbet, surfeited with death, shall groan! And, shuddering, lo, at human woes, The tomb its pond'rous jaws shall close, While Pity's fruitless tear embalms the stone. Oh! would kind Night extend th' eternal shade, And help in Murder's cause our panting breath! For, lo! to Murder with his reeking blade, The beam of morning seems the gloom of death. Lo, where the innocents repose, Our longing hands shall scatter woes, And Fear shall whiten ev'ry haggard face. Sly to the pillow will we creep, Dash with rude arm the bonds of sleep, And drag a husband from a wife's embrace. In vain shall Terror lift the suppliant cry; Our hearts, two rugged rocks, the sound defy. Behold, behold a youth with muddled brain, Reeling, the Lord knows where, a little drunk, Perhaps to slumber with a fav'rite punk: The rascal mutters Freedom and Tom Paine. Soon, like a pair of eagles on a pig, On this poor midnight stroller let us fall: Drag him before the justice and his wig, And swear to treason that he did not bawl. This will be pleasant to our lords on high, Who call the under-world of man, An assish, mulish, packhorse clan, Shreds of mortality, with scornful eye. Look to the histories of ancient times, Their pleasant prose, and tale-recording rhimes: Kings were God's images—rever'd the throne: Submission then, indeed, with eye-balls low'ring, And suppliant hands and pray'r, and forehead cow'ring, Spoke treason, if she call'd her soul her own. Knock down the man who out of reason rules; Believes that monarchs can be rogues and fools. Virtues are transferable, just like stock, With title-pass, that dignifies a block. Title on ugliness confers a bloom— Bids carrion drop its stench, and breathe perfume— To palaces converts the meanest house, And with an eagle's pinion, mounts the mouse. Saddle black Despot for the field, so strong, With such a spirit as no curb can tame: His chest, like Job's wild horse, with thunder hung, With mouth of bleeding foam, and eye of flame. On Despot mounted, let us boldly ride, And cover mountains with the crimson tide. B? and K?, men of busy merit, Shall rouse to crush the democratic spirit, And at the pris'ners shake their lion-manes; And Curtis, now Lord-May'r, now not so small, Shall fill with culprits soon th' Egyptian hall, From hedges, ditches, alleys, courts, and lanes. Justice shall find brisk work upon her hand: Pronounce quick fate, and thin a miscreant land; Thus lucky thriving, make, in blood campaigns, A nabob's fortune, by her ropes and chains! ODE TO JURYMEN. Sirs, it may happen, by the grace of God, That I, great Peter, one day come before ye, To answer to the man of wig, for ode, Full of sublimity, and pleasant story. Yes, it may so fall out that lofty men, Dundas, and Richmond, Hawk'sb'ry, Portland, Pitt, May wish to cut the nib of Peter's pen, And, cruel, draw the holders of his wit. Nay, Dame Injustice in their cause engage, To clap the gentle poet in a cage! And should a grimly judge for death harangue, Don't let the poet of the people hang. What are my crimes? A poor tame cur am I, Though some will swear I've snapp'd them by the heels; A puppy's pinch, that's all, I don't deny; But Lord! how sensibly a great man feels! A harmless joke, at times, on kings and queens; A little joke on lofty earls and lords; Smiles at the splendid homage of court scenes, The modes, the manners, sentiments, and words: A joke on Marg'ret Nicholson's mad knights; A joke upon the shave of cooks at court, Charms the fair muse, and eke the world delights; A pretty piece of inoffensive sport. Lo, in a little inoffensive smile, There lurks no lever to o'erturn the state, And king and parliament! intention vile! And hurl the queen of nations to her fate. No gunpowder my modest garrets hold, Dark lanterns, blunderbusses, masks, and matches; Few words my simple furniture unfold; A bed, a stool, a rusty coat in patches. Carpets, nor chandeliers so bright, are mine: Nor mirrors, ogling Vanity to please; Spaniels, nor lap-dogs, with their furs so fine: Alas! my little livestock are—my fleas! No, sirs! I wish not to blow up the realm! But thus I've pray'd—‘Her life may Albion keep! Curs'd be the treach'rous fiends, who, at the helm, Would sink the vessel in the gaping deep! ‘May Liberty sit firm upon her throne; And he who dares to shake her, vengeance meet, No matter what his grandeur—let him groan, And Hell's best brimstone the black miscreant sweat! ‘No longer, like his dough, may our Lord May'r Turn pliable, and join the busy Reeves— State jackall hunting through the midnight air, Like Bow-street blood-hounds in pursuit of thieves! ‘And should a judge (a Jefferies) rush to kill; Fierce, like the Libyan savage from his den; Their glorious pow'rs, at once, may juries feel, And still sublimer, feel that they are men! ‘May Richmond's duke, of valour find increase, And, by example, fire the soldier souls; To invalids afford more frequent fleece, And bless the veterans with meat and coals! ‘And may his Grace's fate-improving brains, With guns of leather much old Death surprise; Delight the tyrant with his dread campaigns, And send his pale dominions vast supplies. ‘May Brudenell's head in sense and grace improve! In mercy's balm may B?'s heart be rich— Feel for a sheep-stealer a little love; Whose fur-clad paws alike for mutton itch! ‘May Health, sweet Health, attend on civil list, So very apt to sink in a decline: Whom Doctor Pitt with med'cines can assist— A great physician, whose prescriptions shine! ‘May kings and queens, whom much the muse reveres, With wonted charity themselves comport; And Lady Truth approach the royal ears, And Lady Wisdom be receiv'd at court! ‘No more in courts may weeds of Folly thrive, 'Mid royal smile, their sunshine, waxing strong; Or roaring laughter must be kept alive, And Peter's Clio never want a song. ‘May ev'ry king be lov'd by all the arts; And eke may all the arts be lov'd by him: And when his money from the purse departs, Not play at ducks and drakes on waves of whim, ‘Then for a ?, so lofty and so sweet, Let not œconomy cry ‘Fie upon her!’ But may she give a pillow-case and sheet To each poor slavish shiv'ring maid of honour! ‘Perdition seize the miser who denies A pittance to the helpless pining poor; Who, millions owning, still with watchful eyes, Hawks at fresh bags of gold, and screams for more. ‘May yon Society ne'er want a head. Just like a paper kite that wants a tail; Now dipping, rising, wild at random led, Up, down, here, there, the sport of ev'ry gale. ‘May curates eat, and rear their infant brood; Nay put a little fat about their bones; Cast from their wounded jaws the curb of blood, And dash their lawn-sleev'd riders on the stones! ‘And may those lawn-men, born to happier fate, Chase not the curate from their grand abode; But gravely think of heav'n as well as prate, And give a leg of mutton to their God!’ How base to preach of God's exhaustless store; Of treasures that to mortals will be given; Yet sooner trust (as though they thought it poor) The bank of England than the bank of heav'n! How vile to preach of Heav'n's large int'rest, too, Seeming to place dependence on its word; Yet on sky-credit look so very blue, As though 'twere dang'rous lending to the Lord Such is my song and fervent pray'r, and now To Pitt, Dundas, and Jenkinson, I bow, That spotless Trinity of courtly pow'r! A democratic raven, turn'd court throstle! A persecuting Paul, a meek apostle! The foulest weed, the valley's fairest flow'r! CRUMBS OF COMFORT FOR THE GRAND INFORMER. Lord! R?! why, what a most unlucky chap! What! thou a pris'ner in our hard state trap, The roaring lion of administration! Then Sheridan has nabb'd the beast at last; Lock'd, in the iron gin of Justice, fast: Fun for men, women, children of the nation! R?, verily 'twas too barefac'd to say, Saint Stephen's members might be shorn away, And injure not the body—what a dream! Nay, that our lords may feel alike the blade— Those precious limbs, so shelt'ring with cool shade, From Despotism's intolerable beam; Lopp'd off, without an injury to trunk! Say, great Informer, wert thou mad or drunk! I ne'er said such rude things in all my life! A joke upon a great man and his wife Forms all my sin, though courtiers foam around: I, with my pretty brazen pin and small, Just scratch'd the pretty flow'ry capital; But thou wouldst drag the column to the ground! Pitt wishes to put forth his hand to save; And giant Wyndham, too, his humble slave, Sees thee with grief the tenant of the gin: But London views thee with a scornful smile— Hears with much glee thy howl, and marks thy toil, And looks with triumph on thy suffering skin. ‘Is this the bat,’ cries London, ‘to devour The simple flies, at midnight's silent hour, Wheeling, with hunger keen, from street to street? Is this the mousing owl, that darkling stole In quest of harmless victims from his hole; The bird obscene, whom now our mock'ries meet? ‘The imp, whose heart delights in Nature's sighs, The eves dropper, with damned prying eyes, Who hunts th' unwary for the fangs of state! Is this the justice, of most foul report, Who, proud to please the minions of a c?, Unsated (a staunch blood-hound), pants for fate? ‘Is this the demon, the sworn foe of light, Curs'd by the beauteous wanderers of the night, Whose soul in Mis'ry's moan a music hears, And toad-like, feeds its poison on her tears? ‘Is this th' Informer, that, with bellowing breath, To whips and jails, each son of Freedom dooms; Whose life (misnomer'd life) is death, rank death; Putridity—the noisome stench of tombs?’ Such is the cry of London, luckless R?, In language coarse!—not good enough for thieves! Yet, man, despair not—Courts can set thee free— And courts are known to pity r? like thee. AN ODE TO THE LIVERY OF LONDON, ON THEIR Petition to his Majesty, for kicking out his worthy Ministers. ? Quo ruitis, scelesti? HOR. [PART I.] Why, where the devil are ye rushing? Thus to St. James's rudely pushing, To force the king to turn out Pitt, poor youth! The open Jenkinson, the blushful Rose; Dundas, too, on whom Heav'n bestows Cart-loads of modesty and truth! If aught I know of queens and kings, Their graces will do no such things. And who are you, in impudence so strong? Know ye the rev'rence due to thrones? Down, knaves, upon your marrow-bones, As princes never yet were in the wrong. Ye think ye make a king and queen As Crispin makes a shoe, I ween; And think, like humble shoes, too, ye may wear 'em: Ye feel, by this time, I suppose, That those same shoes can gall your toes, And find your corns not much inclin'd to bear 'em: Old Solomon, of wisdom the great king, Declareth, there's a time for ev'ry thing— Methinks he might have left out impudence: For who should have the impudence to say, That liverymen, compos'd of common clay, Should boast to sovereigns their superior sense; Inform them that the ministers tell lies, Are raggamuffins, wicked, and unwise? Impertinence gets ground, I greatly fear; Such things are said as I can scarcely bear: With insolence the people tax poor Pitt; Now this is cruel!—'tis the poor man's nature, As natural as for fish to cleave the water, Monkeys to grin, dogs howl, and cats to spit. Whoever knew a Pitt that had humility? Fling on the blood, then, all the culpability; Since 'tis well known to all, that Pitt and pride Are dove-tail'd—join as close as bones and hide! The world abuseth Rose in language rude, For ignorance and base ingratitude, And meanness; but 'tis cruel thus to slash— The man had never any education— The poorest tag-rag of the Scottish Nation; Born in a stye, and, hog-like, fed on wash. For gratitude's a sentiment that springs 'Midst gentlefolks and nobles, queens and kings! Like pine apples, whom soil the richest suits; For pine apples ne'er grow on cold, raw clay, But fat manure, amid the solar ray, That darts its golden influence to their roots. What impudence, alas! to say, ‘Sire, we resolve to have our way; And be it known, We'll have no levee-tricks, indeed, And our petition we will read; And you shall hear it on the throne! ‘This is our right by law accounted; So pray your majesty get mounted.’ Such is the saucy language ye have utter'd; Which proves ye know not how your bread is butter'd. At such rude treatment, grandeur winces! So far I'll take the part of princes— Monstrous! they have been scandalously treated; Basted by saucy verse and prose— God knows, Dear souls! like bears by ruffian bull-dogs baited! Poor Louis forc'd to run away, Poor Artois, not inclin'd to stay, From France, like some hard-hunted badger, hast'neth; Now billetted upon the Scots; Sad fates! yea, most unpleasant lots! But whom the Lord doth love, behold he chast'neth! Thus is the Bible in their favour; Yet mis'ry breeds an ugly savour; She smells of musty rags, and dirt, and nits— I won't say bugs, and itch, and lice, Wishing for ever to be nice, As nicety a well-bred Muse befits: And yet it is a truth most melancholly, That mis'ry's often the weak child of folly. Princes are blest with such a dove-like nature; Their hearts compos'd of such nice ductile matter, Turning like potter's clay to any forms! But for their subjects!—heav'ns! their hearts are rock; Their manners, borrow'd from the pig-stye, shock; Their shapes, rank Calibans; their voices, storms! Mild are the souls of princes, like new cheese! And, like the cheese, of milk the simple child, Too often suffer a confounded squeeze From subjects by equality defil'd; Who look with rapture on their grinning graces, Enjoying their sad torments and wry faces. But why and wherefore, I can't tell the grounds; No, verily, my wisdom can't determine, Why subjects should become a pack of hounds, And hunt their sovereign lords like stinking vermin; For no one needs (I'm very sure) be told, Their souls are cast in Nature's sweetest mould. No, no; they are not polecats, pretty creatures! Choke not the nation's chick, nor suck its eggs! Pleas'd with whate'er is giv'n (such gentle natures), Each prince with so much sweetness bows and begs! No, never kite-like on a subject souses, And, sweeping, carries off his lands and houses! ‘There's odds in gossips,’ says an old adage, Forgotten, ah! in this degenerate age: Subjects from fair decorum widely wander! Now ev'ry tradesman lifts his dirty nose; His teeth each working, poor mechanic shows, And cries, ‘What's sauce for goose is sauce for gander!’ Thus, by the impudence of rogues and fools, Are lofty thrones converted to joint-stools! C? christen'd fool's-caps—sceptres turn'd to sticks; A ? smile proclaim'd an idiot grin; A ? a jack-ass in a lion's skin; Courts, puppet-shows; and rev'rence, monkey-tricks! Tricks of a mean, submissive clan, That shame the dignity of man. There's not an Englishman, I do suppose, That would not from his office kick poor Rose, And on his honest earnings lay his pats; Eke on Dundas's, Jenkinson's, poor souls! And eke from humble Richmond tear his coals, A king's black present to his blacker brats Charles the Second's tax upon coals, for the benefit of his bastards.. Nor is there one who would not break, alack! Our lord mayor's wooden leg about his back! Thus is Politeness turn'd a clown— Wisdom in gothic gloom benighted— The world turn'd fairly upside down, I fear me, never to be righted. When such things are 'mongst cobblers, tinkers, tanners, The Lord have mercy on the people's manners! Then, sirs, no more your wanton venom spit At kings and queens, and worthy Mister Pitt: Should the ship founder in this blowing weather, Like friends and neighbours, let us sink together. PART II. Think of old times, when royal folk Made of their subjects a mere joke: Ev'n in the happy days of good Queen Bet, Mum was in parliament the word— Her very frown, a flaming sword; And ev'ry menace put it in a sweat! Think of the horse-whipping she gave Th' ambassador—a saucy knave! In Latin, too, to make the fellow wonder— The man was frighten'd at her voice, And could not then have had his choice; He rather would have fac'd a clap of thunder. Of lords she often lugg'd the ear; And often would her highness swear On bishops, sacred men! enough to shock ye. ‘Do this!’ her majesty would say— ‘Do that!—God's blood! I'll have my way! Quick, quick; or, d?n me, parsons, I'll unfrock ye!’ What to her parliament said she? ‘Good gentlemen, I must agree That ye are proper judges of the weather, And judges, too, of the highways, Hares, pheasants, partridges, and jays; And eke the art of tanning leather. But, as for sovereigns, and dominion, 'Tis too sublime for your opinion.’ Suppose the liverymen had boldly said To this Semiramis of lofty rule, Your majesty must knock off Cecil's head, And hang up Essex for a beast and fool: We relish not these men's administration; So, ma'am, dismiss them, and oblige the nation:’— What had the answer been Of this great queen? Why, to the apothecaries she had roar'd— ‘Ye knaves, who do more mischief than the sword! You vomits, glyster-pipes—the dev'l confound ye! What to such madness, raggamuffins, urges? Murderers! I'll make you swallow your own purges! In your own mortars, rascals, will I pound ye! ‘You, bakers, I shall heat your ovens, slaves, And serve you like the three Jew boys, ye knaves, Shadrach, and Meshech, and Abednego: Browner than all your loaves, shall be your skins: Then let us see, if, for your saucy sins, Your God will deign to take ye out or no. ‘You poulterer, wag not thus your tongue so loose, For fear I pluck ye, as ye pluck your goose. And, Master Skinner, calm your upstart pride— On Marsyas think your flaming rage to cool, Who, wrestling with his betters, like a fool, Lost, in his struggle for the prize, his hide! ‘And Master Barber, mind the beard and wig; And Master Pipemaker, don't be a prig, And let that clay of yours be quite so stiff; Nor in your prowess try to smoke a queen, For fear her majesty's sharp wrath be seen, And send you to the devil on a whiff. ‘Leviathans be catechis'd by sprats! Mind, if one more complaint ye bring, By G?, ye dangle like a pack of rats, All in a string!’ Thus to those men the great Queen Bess had said, Bridling and tossing in contempt her head; And thus the queen, with equal fury blest, Had smartly rapp'd the knuckles of the rest. Then, turning to her marv'ling lords, her Grace, Wiping the sweat that gemm'd her precious face, Had said, ‘God's-blood, my lords, a fine discourse! Those fellows talk to me—the small-beer dregs! They teach, forsooth, their grannum to suck eggs! They'll find the old grey mare the better horse.’ Then why should gentle George of pow'r have less; Than that same furious Amazon, Queen Bess? What said her loyal parliament again? ‘We must not move her grace's ire— Lord, bless us! should we once complain, The fat will all be in the fire! Low to her feet, like spaniels, we must crawl, Or, lo! she'll play the devil with us all!’ Now, to return to Pitt, ye roar, ‘Out with the rascal!—what a bore To keep a fellow that undoes the realm! A great land-lubber! he, he, steer The foundering ship from danger clear! Pretending puppy! he, he guide the helm?’ Not long ago, in paradise, Ye stuff'd his mouth with figs and spice, To show your love for him and all his schemes; Drench'd him with treacle, till besmear'd Like Aaron's patriarchal beard, From whence the oil of gladness flow'd in streams. His head with ev'ry grocer-glory crowning; And now you are for kicking, hanging, drowning! So different now, indeed, your carriage, It puts me much in mind of marriage. Now love, now hate; now smile, now tear; Now sun, now cloud; now mist, now clear; Now music, now a stunning clap of thunder; Now perfect ease, now spiteful strife, So much like matrimonial life! Pray read the pretty little story under; A tale well known: 'Tis John and Joan. JOHN AND JOAN, A TALE. Hail, wedded love! the bard thy beauty hails! Though mix'd, at times, with cock and hen-like sparrings: But calms are very pleasant after gales, And dove-like peace much sweeter after warrings: I've written—I forget the page, indeed; But folks may find it, if they choose to read— ‘That marriage is too sweet without some sour— Variety oft recommends a flow'r. ‘Wedlock should be like punch, some sweet, some acid; Then life is nicely turbulent and placid. ‘A picture that is all in light— Lord, what a thing! a very fright! No, let some darkness be display'd; And learn to balance well with shade.’ John married Joan—they frown'd, they smil'd; Now parted, and now made a child: Now tepid show'rs of love, now chilling snows; Much like the seasons of the year; Or like a brook, now thick now clear; Now scarce a rill, and now a torrent flows. One day they had a desperate quarrel About a little small-beer barrel, Without John's knowledge slily tapp'd by Joan; For Joan, t'oblige her old friend Hodge, Thought asking leave of John was fudge; And so she wisely left the leave alone. It happ'd that John and Joan had not two beds To rest their angry, frowning brace of heads; Ergo, there was but one To rest their gentle jaws upon. ‘I'll have a board between us,’ cried the man— ‘With all my spirit, John,’ replied the wife: A board was plac'd, according to their plan: Thus ended this barrier at once the strife. On the first night, the husband lay Calm as a clock, nor once wink'd over— Calm as a clock, too, let me say, Joan never squinted on her lover. Two, three, four nights, the sulky pair, Like two still mice, devoid of care, In philosophic silence sought repose; On the fifth morn, it chanc'd to please John's nose to sneeze— ‘God bless you, dear!’ quoth Joan at John's loud nose. At this John gave a sudden start, And, popping o'er the hedge, his head— ‘Joan, did you say it from your heart?’ ‘Yes, John, I did, indeed, indeed!’ ‘You did?’—‘Yes, John, upon my word’— ‘Zounds, Joan, then take away the board!’ Thus it will be with you and Pitt agen; Love will beam forth, that ev'ry love surpasses; The grocers be themselves, sweet-temper'd men, And souse him in a hogshead of molasses. Thus will Contention take away the bone, And you and Pitt kiss friends, like John and Joan. AN ODE TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS, ON THE Report of his Elevation to the important Dignity of a Privy Counsellor. ? Optat ephippia bos. He becomes honours as a sow does a saddle. PROVERBS. Ye gods! Sir Joseph of the counsel privy? Inventive newspapers, I can't believe ye! Impossible! ye certainly are fibbing! Sir Joseph dubb'd a counsellor of state! 'Tis laughing at too high a rate; Lord! what a joke! ye certainly are squibbing! Because we have believ'd th' apostate Pitt, And shown such wondrous want of wit, Ye think that any fable will go down. Now, pray be careful, sirs, of what you print; There's danger—yes, indeed, there's danger in't— Woe to the wight that ridicules a crown! Sir Joseph is for blunt Notwithstanding a thousand experiments in favour of pointed conductors, the knight and co. will not allow the ingenious Franklin, the father of electricity, to be in the right with respect to the superiority of points to nobs: too obstinate (and perhaps too ignorant) to be convinced, and too haughty to yield. conductors; A monarch wanteth sharp instructors: How can such monstrous discords then agree? Then pray speak truth, ye men of news, And do not thus the world amuse: It is not—cannot—must not be! His m?y is surely wise; And wants no talk on butterflies, On eggs and bird-nests, newts and weeds: He wants a man to talk on wars, On dread invasions, wounds, and scars, On stumps, and carcasses, and heads. After a butterfly to scamper, And with a net his captive hamper, Sir Joseph is expert, and must delight; But, as for politics!—O Heav'n! The board must very hard be driv'n, To choose a swearing tadpole knight! To give a breakfast in Soho, Sir Joseph's very bitterest foe Must certainly allow him peerless merit; Where, on a wag-tail, and tom-tit, He shines, and sometimes on a nit, Displaying pow'rs few gentlemen inherit. I grant he is no intellectual lion, Subduing ev'ry thing he darts his eye on; Rather, I ween, an intellectual flea, Hopping on Science's broad bony back, Poking its pert proboscis of attack, Drawing a drop of blood, and fancying it a sea! But should reports be true, alas! (And marv'lous things oft come to pass), Should he be dubb'd a king's adviser; 'Twill be so wonderful a change— So very, very, very strange! What's stranger still, the council won't be wiser! From Joseph Banks unto Sir Knight, Then privy counsellor in spite Of Nature, brain, and education! If, for the last, he hands has kiss'd; There's not a reptile on his list E'er knew a stranger transmutation. How could Sir Joseph have the face To take so dignified a place? But probably the knight will say, the elf, ‘Why should not I, as well as some of those Who this same wondrous board compose? There are not wiser fellows than myself.’ To give the Devil his due, That's true.— While Pitt harangues on France and Spain, Sir Joseph on a beetle's brain, A fly, a toad, a tadpole's tail: While Pitt is on the emperor's loan, For Britain's jaws so hard a bone, Sir Joseph's on a weed and snail! While Pitt is thinking of supplies, And turns, poor man! his hopeless eyes On what may lift us from the bog; The knight his head for flea-traps rakes, Or louse-traps, or deep-studying makes A pair of breeches for a frog See the works of Bonnet and Spalanzani, a pair of frog-tailors, who employed a great deal of time and ingenuity in cutting out taffety breeches for the males of the little croaking nation, during their amours, in order to establish some beautiful and delicate facts relative to impregnation.. While majesty and his wise nobles Shall weep o'er England's groans and troubles, Ordering great guns to make the Frenchmen caper; Of reptiles will the knight be dreaming, And instruments for insects scheming, To stretch their little limbs on paper. Gods! if amidst some grand debate, All for the good of our great state, A moth should flutter, would the man sit quiet? Forgetting state affairs, the knight Would seize his hat with wild delight, And, chasing, make the most infernal riot: O'erturning benches, statesmen, ev'ry thing, To make a pris'ner of the mealy wing! Were Brunswick here, I'd tell the king of glory A simple story; An Æsop's tale, by way of illustration, Proving Sir Joseph's awkward elevation. As how a cat did Jupiter implore (For cats like Christians said their pray'rs of yore), That he would make her a young lady fair; And how, of rattling thunder the great God Consented to it with his usual nod, And made her pretty too as she could stare. And then as how, upon her wedding-night, When in her deary's loving arms lock'd tight, She heard behind the bed a rat; Sudden from his embrace she gave a spring, Forgetting love, and kiss, and ev'ry thing, To catch the vermin like a cat: And how, to punish her, with huge disdain, The angry god made miss a cat again. Thus may the king, like his great brother Jove, Forget his partiality and love; And as Jove justly serv'd the cat, to shame her; So, from a counsellor, the king of men May make the knight a grub-hunter agen, And bid him mind his butterflies and hammer.Since the foregoing Ode was given to the printer, it is too true that the newspapers were in the right. The knight is bonâ fide dubbed a privy counsellor. Ridicule enjoys a second feast on the occasion. Her first treat was his elevation to the chair of the immortal Newton. Sir Joseph must not complain at his being so frequently the subject of a poetical laugh; Folly is the natural and fair game of Satire. To wreak his revenge on the Muse, by condemning her to silence, let him cease to play the fool. Amotâ causâ, tollitur effectus—I beg the knight's pardon, for I recollect that he has forgotten all his Latin, and retains his native vulgar tongue only. ADVERTISEMENT. My bookseller assuring me, with a most solemn countenance, that the public expect more for their half-crown than was provided: in imitation of our most compliable Administration, I have yielded to their hungry wishes, and cooked up a pretty dish of bubble and squeak. The composition is elegiac, that is to say, full of complaint and tenderness; and I have moreover baptized it a Jeremi-ad, on account of a tender and sublime resemblance between my song and the songs of the prophet. The birth of my Jeremi-ad immediately succeeded Pitt's and Grenville's two celebrated Bills of Terror. It pathetically lamenteth the fallen state of one of our most admired poets, videlicet, myself! and is addressed to Mr. George Rose, of the treasury, a pains-taking man, of low extraction, pitiful talents, and of no education; but who, finding, in his journey from Scotland to England, a couple of ladders, very much like those employed by Messieurs Pitt, Dundas, Jenkinson, and Co. called impudence and perseverance, ascended, like the aforesaid bold gentlemen, to nearly the same plane of elevation; showing thereby the little or no importance of merit and modesty towards the attainment of fortune and honours. A JEREMI-AD, ADDRESSED TO GEORGE ROSE, ESQ. OF THE TREASURY. Where is the power of Peter?—where the quills That from the porcupine at Folly flew? Where, where his cannon that in thunder kills? The sword of Satire that its thousands slew? The voice that, like the rams'-horns, levell'd walls, Has lost its fury—to a whisper dies! The look of Pitt the poet's tongue appals! ‘Curs'd be the bard!’ the politician cries. What fine large shot was mine for high-crown'd heads! Those glorious pheasants! noble cocks and hens! But now of smaller size I cast my leads, Forc'd (what a paltry mark!) to fire at wrens! No more I smile at Buc?am's fair house, Nor sharpen, for a king and queen, my wit; No more indulge my humour with a louse, Content with humbler game, to crack a nit. Now Madam Schwellenberg her ass may straddle, And Jack may fly before a poking pin; The lady, frighten'd, tumble from her saddle, And show her lovely legs without a grin. The bard who bullied Quality with song, Must to the iron times his genius suit; The bard, in energy divinely strong— The bard, whose voice was thunder, must be mute. In vain I gnash my teeth—my hour is o'er; The statesman triumphs!—all my cunning foils! He careth not five farthings for my roar, But mocks the lion struggling in his toils! A hopeful cedar near th' Aonian fount, I push'd my daring top into the skies; Grac'd with my large, luxuriant limbs the mount, And drew the wonder of a million eyes! Struck (not illumin'd) by their anger's flame, Amid the work of terror, shook my form! Low to the earth, my head with rev'rence came, And own'd the passing genius of the storm! Who, who could fancy such disgrace, alas! Heav'ns! what a change!—a mighty change prevails! The second king of Babylon at grass! Satire's archangel fall'n to feed on snails! Since Pitt and Grenville, daring dreadful things, Full of their magnanimities, agree That Peter shall not laugh at queens and kings, Permit me, gentle George, to laugh at thee. A COMMISERATING EPISTLE TO JAMES LOWTHER, EARL OF LONSDALE AND LOWTHER, Lord Lieut. and Cust. Rot. of the Counties of Cumberland and Westmorland. Quid sentire putas omnes, Calvine, recenti De scelere, et fidei violatæ crimine? Sed nec Tam tenuis census tibi contigit, ut mediocris Jacturæ te mergat onus; nec rara videmus Quæ pateris; casus multis hic cognitus, ac jam Tritus, et è medio Fortunæ ductus acervo. JUVENAL. What think'st thou, Lonsdale, that the world will say Of this d?mn'd verdict at Carlisle to-day? Faith, simply this—‘A flea-bite, and that's all— A loss that will not swallow Lowther-Hall: A trick of Fortune that we often find: A trick that plainly proves the goddess blind.’ THE ARGUMENT. The noble Earl, as naturally in Pursuit of his Coal as a Sportsman of his Hare or Fox, happening in a Coal-chase to undermine a parcel of Houses belonging to the Lord-knows-who, of Whitehaven (no Votes perhaps for a Borough or a County), but particularly of a Mr. Littledale —what does this insolent Littledale, but complain!—Nay, not contented with Complaint, he insists upon it that his Lordship has no Right to pull down his House about his Ears —nay, what is still worse, the Fellow brings an Action, absolutely brings an Action against his Lordship—nay, what is still more horrible, the Knave gets a Verdict in his favour—and, what is more atrocious still, the Villains of the Town and Neighbourhood illuminate their Houses, as if for the Birth-nights of our beloved King and Queen, and exhibit equal Symptoms of Joy. —Notwithstanding this saucy Opposition to their great Superior; notwithstanding the wicked Action; notwithstanding the vile and unnatural Verdict; notwithstanding the triumphant Illumination and brazen-faced Delight on the occasion; how sublimely his Lordship behaves! Though he most spiritedly suspends his Coal-works for a Time, to show the Power of his Vengeance; lo, he promiseth to open them again, on Condition he has full Liberty to undermine any Houses that may impudently stand in the way of his Coal for the future—What an Act of Humanity! partly for the Benefit of himself, a poor Individual; but principally for the Advantage of the Town and Neighbourhood of Whitehaven! Who, besides his Lordship, would have done this? It is too humane—it is too great—for as it has been observed by some celebrated Divines, that a Man may be over-righteous, so verily may a great Peer be over-forgiving.—Such is the Ground of my Epistle to Lord Lonsdale—and, for the Advantage as well as Amusement of Posterity, I have subjoined the Letters that passed between some of the People of Whitehaven and his Lordship; they are Curiosities that ought to be preserved amidst the Archives of Submission, Generosity, and Literature. What, Lonsdale! after all thy ranting, tearing, High threat'ning, hect'ring, bullying, kicking, swearing— What! thou, the brazen bully that bestrode Triumphant navies and the roaring flood, Yield to the anger of a tiny town, Who oft hath frighten'd counties with a frown! A set of smutty colliers mock thy pow'r! A hogstye lord it o'er a lofty tow'r! A few blind mice, in little league ally'd, Ye gods! o'erturn a pyramid of pride! Shades of the Lowthers, arm'd with vengeance, rise, And shake this Lonsdale, who his birth belies. Shock'd at his weakness, History turns pale, And madly tears the leaf that holds the tale. Look through the desert of five hundred years! Lo, not a Lowther virtue once appears. Then why to Fame's fair volume madly rush, And give thy poor old ancestors a blush? Ah, do not so unfashionably dote, And stitch one spangle on an old black coat. Let not one act ten thousand acts upbraid! A farthing candle midst a world of shade. But grant a solitary deed—achieve it— Pray, who the devil, Lonsdale, will believe it? Thus will the nation with one voice exclaim— ‘A Lowther do an act of virtuous fame! When from a Lowther did a scyon shoot, A Lowther trunk not rotten at the root? Expect much sooner, nonpareils from crabs, Honour from thieves, and decency from drabs. Horace declares (a bard whom all approve) The vulture never breeds the tender dove.’ Learn, Lonsdale, learn Ambition's spur to feel, And snap, like mites, a million at a meal. See yon proud oak, whose dark'ning branches spread High o'er the rills that course the pebbled bed! With what humility those rills salute, And trembling wind around his rugged root; Like busy slaves, their little stock afford, And creeping, kissing, feed their frowning lord! Mark, too, around that oak's majestic pride, The pismires crawling up his channell'd side; And mark his shelt'ring limbs, support of fowl, The wren, the hawk, the cuckoo, and the owl. Say, Lonsdale, canst thou not resemblance see, Resemblance strong between that oak and thee? Why be a willow, then, and meanly bend? Why bid the Lowther blood in Lonsdale end? How! has thine heart dismiss'd its lordly state, And op'd to Pity's cry its iron gate? Or is that heart, which soar'd o'er man, sublime, Struck by the palsying hand of envious Time? Say, does Repentance wound thee?—'tis a driv'ler. Despise that thing call'd Meekness—'tis a sniv'ler. With pious sentiments, forsooth, who glows, And kisses the vile hand that deals her blows. Spurn at Forgiveness, that ev'n fears to chide, And keep again the company of Pride. Go herd with Brudenell, who with Bardolph face Scowls high contempt on all th' untitled race: Go herd with Leeds, in native pride so stable, Who scorns to let his mother Poor Mistress Anguish has been refused, in form, the honour of a knife and fork near her most exalted daughter. ‘Nimium ne crede colori:’ the duke is by no means so soft a man as he looks. sit at table: Herd with the dame of Blenheim Lady Susan Stuart, equal in good qualities, beauty, and accomplishments, to any of the Spencers, is presumed, by her union with her son, the Marquis of Blandford, absolutely to have defiled the family., of hard lot, Whose pride lies poison'd by the lovely Scot; Mad that the Marlb'rough blood, where honour reigns, Should join the puddle of a Sawney's veins: Herd with the lofty 'squire of Strawb'ry Hill, Whom genealogies with rev'rence fill; Who on no threads of value puts That are not fairly spun from William's guts. How great in Horace thus to rev'rence birth; Himself a well-known clod of common earth? What, Lonsdale, melted down thy ruthless rage?— With dæmons once thy spirit dar'd engage, Spat on the mob that Freedom's ensigns bore, Smil'd at his storm, and mock'd his thunder-roar; Fac'd keen Contempt, and Murder's sanguine eye, And horsewhipp'd whining Mercy to her sky. How art thou sunk! how wither'd!—Lost, I fear, Where is the Lowther spirit—tell me where? Speak, can the ghost of Conscience haunt thy mind? Hear'st thou the call of Death in ev'ry wind?— Lo, Resolution to thy terror turns, And o'er the skeleton of Manhood mourns! Go, Wonder, to Earth's utmost limits fly, And, say, if aught like this e'er stretch'd thine eye. Rouse! and let ‘Richard be himself again!’— Forge, forge anew Oppression's galling chain; Strip o'er his ears bold Opposition's skin, And bid with gags the mouth of Freedom grin. Bid the dark Furies all thy bosom steel, And Cumberland afresh thine anger feel: Yes, yes, of Cumberland the comet, blaze, And, crab-like, roast her rascals with thy rays. Stretch o'er the shrinking towns thine arm of pow'r, And, hydra-like, their croaking frogs devour. Show that thy breath, like Envy's, baleful blows: A canker be, that kills the lovely rose. Prove how a rising country can be curst, And bid with spleen old Nero's spectre burst. How pleasing to thine eyes should be the band That happy fatten'd on the fertile land; Forc'd Cain-like off, where Famine sucks her nails, To starve, or hunt the wall and hedge for snails.— Thus triumph—‘Shall Dominion's ensigns sink, And to a beggar's rag, a malkin sink? What! shall the vulture-wing, that scour'd the sky, Sneak to a bat's, that shuns the public eye? Jove's bird (the thunder from his talons torn) Turn owl, to cry, ‘Tee-whit’ in some old barn? What! I, through Opposition's surly surge Who boldly dar'd so oft a passage urge, Cry out at last, ‘Help, help’—to fear a slave, Pale, panting, puking; spent beneath the wave? Shall Resolution that defied a world, Oppos'd by pigmies, from his height be hurl'd? Those pigmies o'er the huge man mountain straddle, Or, laughing, rock the giant in a cradle? No, low-bred villains—nought my pow'r controls; I'll hunt you all like vermin through your holes; Out, root and branch—men, women, dogs and cats; Run children from the ruins just like rats: Writhe into earth, like worms, and fear my frown; For, d?mn me, all your houses shall come down. Wretches, your heads are in the lion's jaws; Off with them—Lonsdale dares defy the laws. What though it thins my purse, it feeds my spleen; So, scythe of Desolation, sweep the scene.’ Such is the glowing language thou shouldst hold, And nobly emulate thy sires of old. For speech like this (too weak the voice of Fame) The mouths of cannon shall convey thy name— Such threat'ned deeds of hostile, godlike ire, Should travel only on the wings of fire. Shall Pity be an inmate of thy breast: No, be a grinding-stone its rugged guest. Why should a virtue, man, thy mind bewitch; Lo, Generosity was never rich. What! woo the Virtues!—of the world the sport— Nay, worse, who dare not show their nose at court! What gives the general wish for pow'r to glow? To look contemptuous on the world below; To bid that world bow down, admire, adore, And grind the sallow faces of the poor. Ask, to the forest-laws what man gave birth? A Nimrod, lo! a lofty lord of earth!— Yet why should hares, and partridges, and grouse, Alone be ravish'd from the farmer's house?— Go, Lonsdale, get an act to raise thy fame, And make the farmers' wives and daughters game. Whence on a sudden, dost thou thus inherit This soft, forbearing, lamb-like, dove-like spirit? I saw sharp Vengeance tip-toe-in thine eyes:— How comes it that the threat'ning spirit dies? Yet, yet I see the feudal times return, When tyrants bid in chains the million mourn; When slaves, to grandeur crouch amid the dust, And Havoc roams, to please the ruling lust; When Pride as calmly from the shoulder plucks The heads of vassals as the heads of ducks. Curse on the liberty of modern days! Again let pow'r her rod of iron raise. Hang the French dogs, a mangy, mongrel cry, That, running riot, on their huntsman fly! How are the sacred robes of Greatness rent! Kings and nobility fall'n cent. per cent! Sure, Lonsdale! thou art not too weak to know From general riches what misfortunes flow. Wealth for delicious slavery spoils a nation— Adieu at once to gods and adoration. Say, would you bid the under-world adore, Crouch, flatter, tremble?—Keep the rascals poor. Tyrannic, would you wish to cut and carve 'em? Their backs are at your service—only starve 'em? Give them but money, quick uprise the knaves, Forgetting in a moment they are slaves. Lost to the meanness of their former station, The scornful upstarts damn their occupation. Lo, the proud blacksmith, late a slave to coal, To honours turns his elevated soul! The cross-legg'd tailor, lo, forgets his peers; Kicks his old goose, the knave, and breaks his shears! The show-man scorns poor Punch, his late support, And straw-stuff'd ladies of th' Arcadian court; This quits his camel—that, his conj'ring hogs; And kings no more can dance with dancing-dogs It is an undeniable fact, that a certain great king (it is said, for the diversion of his children only) held out the skirts of his coat, and danced a minuet on Windsor Terrace, some years since, with one of the canine figurantes.. Grant wealth—No more the humble cobbler cow'rs; But boldly deems his blood as rich as ours, And blasphemously thinks th' Almighty's plan Ordain'd no diff'rence between man and man. Such is the sad effect of wealth—rank pride— Thus, mount a beggar, how the rogue will ride. Parent of Insolence is wealth, I ween: Then 'mid thy neighbours let her not be seen. 'Tis Poverty that forges curbs for men, And tempts divine Oppression from her den. What folly, then, to let thine host repose, To suffer Cumberland to lift the nose!— Down with their hosts, and horsewhip them like dogs! Styes be their beds, their food the food of hogs. Keep famish'd, sons and daughters, fathers, mothers; Nor let them beat in trade their grinning brothers; Iberian monkeys, that to business bred, Well pleas'd, for maravedes A very small Spanish coin, much inferior in value to a farthing. hunt the head. To India's hist'ry turn thy happy eyes, And bid a second scene of horrors rise. By Britons led, did Famine's spectre train Pour devastation on the fair domain. What humble victims sunk beneath the strife! What thousands, tott'ring, snatch'd at parting life! Nought could, alas! their suppliant hands avail: In vain each feature told a starving tale; On those rich heaps that rose beneath their care, Their eye-balls fast'ning in a deadly glare. There hadst thou seen the sallow babe distrest, Hard clinging to a dying mother's breast; Beating that breast with little, peevish cry, Its plumpness wither'd, and its fountain dry: Such was the scene, whilst ev'ry night, to sup, The jackalls left their woods, to eat them up. Humanity's a pigeon-hearted fool, Soft, puling, as the girl at boarding-school, That alms upon the begging wretch bestows, And learns to sorrow at the tale of woes. Where is ambition? Dead?—It never dies— Brutes, insects boast it—elephants and flies. The horse would rather the blood-spur should gore him, Than let a fellow-trav'ler pace before him: And lo the spaniel!—when the master cheers A brother, with what jealousy he hears! Unblest, attention how he tries to raise; Paws for a gentle pat, and whines for praise! Eye nature through, and mark the arm of pow'r— The great unceasingly the small devour. Blest on a dainty dish of flies to dine, Lo, by the spider weav'd the silken line, A giddy wand'rer strikes the waving net; Hitch'd his poor pinions, hitch'd his harmless feet: Quick from his cave, that hid his watchful head, The nimble tyrant scours along the thread; Whips from the store-room of his guts a string, And binds his captive's vainly-buzzing wing; Remorseless deals the bite of death; and then The Cacus drags the victim to his den. Lo, hov'ring in mid sky, the caitiff kite Sweeps the blue vault, and wheels with watchful flight; A son of rapine, and untaught to spare, The feather'd Nimrod roams the wild of air; At length his searching eyes with joy explore A hen and chicken near a farmer's door: Sudden the tyrant quits th' aërial steep; Down from his sphere he pours with lightning sweep, Each iron talon fills with callow food, And carries off in triumph half the brood. In vain the parent flutters, capers, cries, And kens her captive children up the skies; And, lo! in vain the cursing farmer runs, To send the leaden vengeance from his guns: Safe seeks the rogue some solitary stone, To tear the trembling flesh, and grind each bone. Now on the stream's clear bosom, pr'ythee, peep; See, sly below, the alligator creep: Whate'er he seizes, yield's to Fate's dread laws, Crush'd in his hard inexorable jaws. These be thy great examples—careful mind 'em, And do not in a tittle lag behind 'em. Be thou the spider, that devours the flies; Be thou the tyrant kite, that scours the skies; Be thou the hard-mouth'd subtle alligator, Th' inexorable monarch of the water. And lo, the lords of Ocean!—see the whale On all th' inferior hosts of sea regale! The shark, the grampus—how before their eye Th' affrighted under-world of fishes fly! Then why not man, endu'd with giant pow'r, The region of inferior mortals scour? For thee, then, was all Cumberland design'd, The whale, the shark, the grampus of mankind! Lo, at thy foot, the people whine and pray— But kick them, Lonsdale—'tis the Lowther way: Tread on each neck, and deem it but a beast, And emulate the tyrants of the east. Perchance thou fearest to be d?mn'd, or so? On that, thou shouldst have ponder'd long ago. Look at thy boroughs—not one vote alone Can give a candidate the mob-rais'd throne. Thus to the shrine of virtue must be giv'n More than one deed, to seat the soul in heav'n. Deem otherwise—it were too mad by half— Lord! how would shoe-makers Shoe-makers are frequently the most respectable votes in country boroughs. and angels laugh! With abject pray'r, behold! Whitehaven plies thee— Heed not her men—'tis plain they all despise thee. For ask thyself, ‘Amid this smutty nation, What have I done to merit approbation?’ Look!—has Contrition swell'd a single eye? List!—from one bosom canst thou hear her sigh? Nought like a tear, and nought resembling moan! Knee and mouth penitence, indeed, alone. With voices louder than the common crier's, I hear their hearts abuse their tongues for liars! For, Lord! how should they like thee? who can tell?— Their noses never caught thy kitchen's smell; For meat is apt opinion to improve, And stomachs form a turnpike-gate to love. Kite of the north, again, and yet again, I bid thee spread thy terrors o'er the plain. Hang o'er those sparrows with o'ershadowing pride, And bid them trembling in their thatches hide: O wake thy plagues, and break the shameful truce: Unmuzzle Vengeance—let the blood-hound loose, To bid Humanity, pale fool, adieu, And flesh his hunger on the coal-black crew. Thus shall the Lowther name again be great, Men tremble at the sound, and children sweat; High o'er thy walls, to prove a host, one slave, The lordly flag of Tyranny shall wave: Thus at thy fect shall dumb Obedience fall, And H?ll, in lustre, yield to Lowther Hall. PINDARIANA; OR, PETER'S PORTFOLIO. CONTAINING TALE, FABLE, TRANSLATION, ODE, ELEGY, EPIGRAM, SONG, PASTORAL, LETTERS. With Extracts from TRAGEDY, COMEDY, OPERA, &amp;c. ‘Non satis est pulchra esse poëmata—’ HOR. To me, a tuneful line is dear; And yet it only wins the ear: Verses should win the heart too—dulcia sunto: Such verses sure success command: The game is in the poet's hand— Spadillio, and Mannillio, Basto, Punto. TO THE PUBLIC. READER, Pleasant and numerous are the volumes in ana; viz. Scaligeriana, Thuana, Huetiana, enagiana, Chævreana, Carpenteriana, &amp;c. to which I have added, for thine amusement, Pindariana. May the spirits of Chaucer, of Shakespeare, of Cervantes, of Rabelais, of Sterne, of Fontaine, of Tibullus, of Horace, of Martial, of Theocritus, and my great old cousin of Thebes, have entered my Portfolio, and animated my leaves Ah! may no eye wax dim upon my page; The lid, all heavy-laded, dully closing; The drooping head, as though from palsied age, Reclining lumpish on the breast, and dozing; While from th' ungrasping hand, tremendous sound, The poor forgotten volume greets the ground! May no fastidious critic be able to say of my lucubrations what the blaspheming Dr. Johnson, with his oracular and growling pomposity, asserted of the sublime Ossian—‘that as good a thing might be written by many men, many women, and many children!’ Griev'd should I be, could my poetic spawn Produce one melancholy, damning yawn. O let me feel the muse's warmth divine! Perdition seize a soporific line! Ne'er may the leaden lumber load my brain! Avaunt the sleepy verse! confound the song That dragging, heavy, snail-like, crawls along! Oblivion, bid thy mud o'erwhelm the strain! I hate it, as old Snuffle I abhor; The parson who, with one unvarying tone, Sets all the jaded audience in a snore— Such the strong opiate of his drowsy drone. Nor, O ye pow'rs of poesy, be mine The roaring, blust'ring, mad, and bullying line, As though the muses all were lying-in Of some wild Calibanish, mountain form; An earthquake, or volcano, or a storm, So huge the sound, so horrible the din. Nor let me prove so pompously obscure— A mode of writing, I detest, abjure; With stiff inversions the poor sense to screen From ev'ry aching brain, and poring eye, And in a rage to make the reader cry, ‘Why, what the devil can the booby mean? Thus too with epithets to cannonade us, As if the beast were vomiting a gradus!’ Let me not act the goose, screaming and waddling, Poking his silly head, in mudpools paddling: No!—with a lofty pinion let me rise; Face with an eagle wing the solar beam, Drink with undazzled gaze th' effulgent stream, And with the rush of whirlwinds sweep the skies; Thence, in an instant be the humble wren, Twitt'ring his love-notes sweet to Mistress Hen. O Versatility, I hold thee dear! The Proteus power be mine, to take each shape; Skip like a Will-o'-whisp—be here, be there— Now the grave moralist, and now an ape. Now roar the savage of the Libyan shade, Where horror listens to the shrieking ghost; Now Pompey in Belinda's bosom laid, Or whining, pawing for a piece of toast. Now roll the monarch of the stormy deep, The floundering terror of the finny race; Now the slim eel, of ponds so lucid, creep; Now leap a salmon, and now glide a plaice. Thrice happy change of soul-delighting song! This were my talent, blest would Peter be! But who, alas! is thus divinely strong? Shakespeare, that envied pow'r I mark in thee. Let me inform thee, reader, that no order will be observed with respect to the various pieces. Thou wilt receive them as they leap from the portfolio; so that there will subsist as little connexion between one and another, as between Lady Mary and the Graces, Lord Th?w and the Lord's Prayer, Signor Marchesi and creation, Sir Joseph Banks and philosophy, Sir William Hamilton and the secrets of Mount Vesuvius, Judge K. and a whole bottle of port, Judge B. and reprieve. Various will be the subjects of the muse. Ode, Elegy, Fable, Tale, Ballad, Epigram, &amp;c. a version, at times, of parts of the venerable classics, whose spirit has been but feebly transfused through our modern languages, will be given; Whose oaks so lofty (what abomination!) Are chang'd to paltry broomsticks, by translation: Their pyramids, a little village spire; Their skies, blue paper; their ear-rending thunder, With lightnings darting danger, blazing wonder, A poor coal coffin bouncing from the fire; Their cities, emmets' nests—a spider's hole! Their mountains, what?—the mansion of the mole. Too oft the roses of th' Athenian vale Resign their blushes for a deadly pale; An Attic sun converted in a trice To a dull torpid cake of shiv'ring ice! A rill, their oceans that no longer roar; Their storms, a wind's small whistle through a door; The sun-clad eagle, a weak flick'ring bat; And Afric's royal brute, a squeaking rat. The tender passion will make a prominent figure on the canvass; and why not, as it is one of the most prominent features of Nature? Who is there that has not sacrificed to the amorous goddess? When dew-clad Evening's modest blushes fade, And Nature sinks amid the deep'ning shade, And Labour pauses on the fainting light: When beetles hum, and bats in circles skim, When hills and hamlets, trees and tow'rs, grow dim, And Silence steals upon the gloom of night; With joy I tread the secret grove, To meet the idol of my love. What a monster, who never felt the soft emotion! Ah! whence art thou, of wealth the slave? Go, seek the haunted gloom, the grave; Whose eye, on money taught to roll, Admits not beauty to the soul: Fly thou the day, who scorn'st the fair, For thou wert born an imp of care. But who art thou, with anxious eye, With panting hope, and melting sigh, Who biddest tempting gold depart, And only woo'st the virgin's heart? Go thou where Beauty holds her throne; For bliss was form'd for thee alone. Next to the contemner of the charming sex, is the savage who abuses it. Poor Marian! sweet is thy song of sorrow! MARIAN'S COMPLAINT. SINCE truth has left the shepherd's tongue, Adieu the cheerful pipe and song; Adieu the dance at closing day, And, ah! the happy morn of May. How oft he told me I was fair, And wove the garland for my hair! How oft for Marian cull'd the bow'r, And fill'd my lap with ev'ry flow'r! No more his gifts of guile I'll wear, But from my brow the chaplet tear; The crook he gave, in pieces break, And rend his ribbons from my neck. How oft he vow'd a constant flame, And carv'd on ev'ry oak my name! Blush, Colin, that the wounded tree Is all that will remember me. Rich fragments of the Tragic and Comic Muse, not forgetting the muse of ballad, yclept Opera, will occasionally pour their coruscations through the work. —Moreover will I present thee with delicious scraps of Criticism: thou shalt likewise have Apophthegms —so that a part of my labours may with propriety be baptized the Wisdom of Peter. The Wisdom of Solomon is well known. Plato and Xenophon, the two famous disciples of Socrates, gathered the good things of their sublime master, fancying every sentence that dropped from his mouth, a gem of inestimable value. Pythagoras uttered sage maxims for the benefit of posterity. Nor did the good Marcus Aurelius think it beneath his dignity to turn collector. The eastern hemisphere glitters with apophthegmatic constellations; and now behold a bard resolved to add a star to that of the west. Reader, thou shalt have more than all this. Thou shalt be presented with some of the Travels of the bard, who, like the hero of the Odyssey, mores hominum multorum videt et urbes. But expect no wonders, as I am neither a Mandeville, a Psalmanazar, nor an Abyssinian Bruce. Unfortunately I have met with no ‘Anthropophagi, and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.’ How many numbers I shall offer thee, is a mystery even to myself.—Should we not be eaten up by the threatening and hungry sans-culottes; by the blessing of Apollo and the Nine Ladies, a handsome volume or two may be produced; and to give thee my sentiment on the sans-culottes subject, I really think we shall not be devoured. Howl thyself hoarse, wild war—of this fair isle The happy natives shall for ever smile, While by thy rage the kingdoms bleed around; Safe as the chirping birds amid the oak, That bids defiance to the tempest's stroke, And keeps with stern sublimity his ground. ADIEU. PROLOGUE. TO THE CRITICS. Now Winter gathers all his glooms, And faintly Sol the world illumes; Weak wand'rer, skirting pale the southern sky, Yet squinting on the old blue road, In summer with such splendor trod, Now far, alas! above his wat'ry eye. Well! just as Winter comes, so drear, Behold the man of rhimes appear! Much like the woodcock—bird too often bit; When out are dogs, and sportsmen dire, To try to fit him for the fire; Doom'd soon to turn, poor fellow, on the spit! Lo, from his shelt'ring shade he vainly springs! With bleeding breast, crush'd legs, and broken wings, And scatter'd plumes a cloud, and hanging head, Down falls the emigrant, a lump of lead; Soon seiz'd by Tray, expecting much applause, Who, wriggling, brings the pris'ner in his jaws. Thus may it most unfortunately be, Most venerable greybeards, with poor me! Condemn'd, for want of poetry and wit, To turn perchance upon your piercing spit; Yet, sirs, I thank you for all favours past; Hoping, moreover, they won't be the last: And, sirs, whatever fate you may allot me, Thanks, thanks, that hitherto you have not shot me. So much to the liberal critics;—what shall I say to the illiberal? Rake, if you please, the kennel of your brains, And pour forth all the loaded head contains; I shall not suffer by it, I am sure!— Nay, my poetic plants will better thrive; Exalt their heads and smile—be all alive; As mud is very excellent manure. Brother authors, attend unto the wisdom of Peter. Are the cries of the malevolent and envious against you? Be silent, and let your works fight their own battle. Are they good for nothing? Let them die. Possess they merit? They need not be afraid.—Bid your minds then sit calmly on their thrones, amidst the hurly burly of critical attacks. Go take a lesson from the glorious sun, Who, when the elements together run In wild confusion—earth and wind and water, Looks on the tumult down without dismay, Nay, bright and smiling—seeming thus to say, ‘Lord! bustling gentlefolk, pray what's the matter?’ HYMN TO THE GUILLOTINE. Daughter of Liberty, whose knife So busy chops the threads of life, And frees from cumb'rous clay the spirit; Ah! why alone shall Gallia feel The beauties of thy pond'rous steel? Why must not Britain mark thy merit? Hark! 'tis the dungeon's groan I hear; And lo, a squalid band appear, With sallow cheek and hollow eye! Unwilling, lo, the neck they bend; Yet, through thy pow'r, their terrors end, And with their heads the sorrows fly! O let us view thy lofty grace;— To Britons show thy blushing face, And bless rebellion's life-tir'd train!— Joy to my soul! she's on her way, Led by her dearest friends, Dismay, Death, and the Devil, and Tom Paine! Be deaf, O man, to the insinuations of pride. It is the poisonous weed of the heart, that suffers not a flower of beauty or fragrance to bloom near it. Boast not of the antiquity of thy line: for, to thy mortification, be it known, that the family of the hogs was created before thee. What can the wisest boast? alas, how little! Then, Pride, be sparing of thy saucy spittle; Nay, do not squirt it in the humblest face: The wheel of Fortune is for ever turning; Joy's birthday-suit may soon be chang'd to mourning! Nimrods become the victims of the chace. Yes, Pride, I hate thee—canker of our nature! Why look contemptuous on a fellow-creature, Because it is a monkey or a pig? They too have qualities, or I'm mistaken: What man excels a hog in making bacon? What mortals, like a monkey, dance a jig? What man, from bough to bough, like Jacko springs, Ingenious rogue! who twists his tail, and swings? Dare we despise, because they cannot preach, Forsooth, ungifted with the pow'rs of speech? That were a joke indeed to make a song: Ah me! what numbers of the human race Most fortunately had escap'd disgrace, Had Heav'n forgot to give their mouths a tongue! In vain I preach—Pride laughs at all I say; Resolv'd, the fool, to keep her distant way. THE PROUD OLD MAID. A winking, hobbling, crabbed, proud old maid, Whose charms had felt a heavy cannonade From Time's strong batt'ry—to whose lofty nose A rotten reputation was a rose, Liv'd in a country town—there spit her spite, And dwelt on scandal's stories with delight. Proud of her name (though poor) indeed was she; In genealogies, an epicure; Knew, to a hair, each person's pedigree, From that of splendor, to the most obscure. Madam Georgina Howard was her name; An appellation always carrying fame, As ev'ry Howard kins with Norfolk's duke; Moreover, ev'ry Campbell of our Isle, Cobbler, or chimney-sweeper, claims Argyle; And eke to Queensb'ry doth a Douglas look; Boasting a certain portion of that blood, Not to be wash'd away by Noah's flood. Cousin of Norfolk, would she often name, When conversation ask'd for no such kin; Cousin of Norfolk, then untimely came; Nay, by the head and shoulders was lugg'd in. This lady, on a certain darksome night, From cards returning by a lantern's light; The lantern by her servant Betty held, Who walk'd before this dame, to show the way; When thus it happen'd, sadly let me say, Such is th' unhappiness of blinking Eld— As her two eyes so dim could only stare, And therefore wanted cleaning and repair; Against some head, her poking head she popp'd— Dash'd with confusion, suddenly she stopp'd, Drew back, and bent for once her rusty knee— ‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ said she: Then follow'd Mistress Betty.—‘Bless us, Bet, ‘Tell me, who was the gentleman I met; ‘Whose face I bounc'd so hard against with mine?’ Bet could not for her soul the laugh resist— A gentleman!—a jack-ass, ma'am, you kiss'd; I hope you found Jack's kisses very fine.’ ‘An ass!’ with anger swelling, screech'd the dame— ‘An ass!—Lord! Betty, I shall die with shame! Give me a knife—I'll spoil the rascal's note: Give me a knife—I'll run and cut his throat. Betty, don't say a word on't—that, alas! I curtsied, and ask'd pardon of an ass! EARLY PROPENSITIES. How early, genius shows itself at times! Thus Pope, the pride of poets, lisp'd in rhimes; And thus the great Sir Joseph Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society, and who has often declared this rare fact of himself, and who is so improved in power as to be able to devour an alligator. (strange to utter! To whom each insect-eater is a fool) Did, when a very little boy at school, Munch spiders spread upon his bread and butter! INVITATION TO CYNTHIA. Come, Cynthia, to thy shepherd's vale, Though tyrant Winter shade the scene; The leafless grove has felt his gale, And ev'ry warbler mourns his reign. Yet, what to me the howling wind? Thy voice the linnet's song supplies: Or what the cloud to me, who find Eternal sunshine in thy eyes? KISSES. Hawser. Dear Susan, one kind kiss before we part. Susan. Not the thousandth part of one, Mr. Lieutenant, I assure you. Keep your distance, pray, kind sir. Kisses indeeed! I wonder what fool first invented the nonsense? Hawser. Nonsense!—sense, Susan! rapture, Susan! SONG. When we dwell on the lips of the lass we adore, Not a pleasure in nature is missing: May his soul be in Heav'n, he deserv'd it, I'm sure, Who was first the inventor of kissing. Master Adam, I verily think, was the man, Whose discovery will ne'er be surpast: Well, since the sweet game with creation began, To the end of the world may it last! [Catches Susan and kisses her. THE OLD SHEPHERD'S DOG.I do not love a cat—his disposition is mean and suspicious. A friendship of years is cancelled in a moment by an accidental tread on his tail or foot. He instantly spits, raises his rump, twirls his tail of malignity, and shuns you; turning back, as he goes off, a staring vindictive face, full of horrid oaths and unforgiveness; seeming to say, ‘Perdition catch you! I hate you for ever.’ But the dog is my delight:—tread on his tail or foot, he expresses, for a moment, the uneasiness of his feelings; but in a moment the complaint is ended. He runs around you; jumps up against you; seems to declare his sorrow for complaining, as it was not intentionally done; nay, to make himself the aggressor; and begs, by whinings and lickings, that master will think of it no more. Many a time, when Ranger, wishing for a little sport, has run to the gun, smelt to it, then wriggling his tail, and, with eyes full of the most expressive fire, leaped up against me, whining and begging, have I, against my inclination, indulged him with a scamper through the woods or in the field: for many a time he has left a warm nest, among the snows of winter, to start pleasure for me. Thus is there a moral obligation between a man and a dog. The old shepherd's dog, like his master, was grey, His teeth all departed, and feeble his tongue: Yet where'er Corin went, he was follow'd by Tray; Thus happy through life did they hobble along. When, fatigu'd, on the grass the shepherd would lie, For a nap in the sun—'midst his slumbers so sweet, His faithful companion crawl'd constantly nigh, Plac'd his head on his lap, or lay down at his feet. When Winter was heard on the hill and the plain, And torrents descended, and cold was the wind, If Corin went forth 'mid the tempests and rain, Tray scorn'd to be left in the chimney behind. At length in the straw Tray made his last bed; For vain, against Death, is the stoutest endeavour— To lick Corin's hand he rear'd up his weak head, Then fell back, clos'd his eyes, and, ah! clos'd them for ever. Not long after Tray did the shepherd remain, Who oft o'er his grave with true sorrow would bend; And, when dying, thus feebly was heard the poor swain, ‘O bury me, neighbours, beside my old friend!’ JENNY'S COMPLAINT.Notwithstanding the general contempt of poor Sternhold and Hopkins, of psalm-inditing memory, I do not deem them beneath the dignity of some imitation. I fear that too many a poet of the present day is affected (if I may coin an expression) with a phusi-phobia, or a dread of nature and simplicity; and, if I may judge from the difficulty of comprehending their meaning, they fancy Obscurity to be the genuine parent of the Sublime. In the following ballad I have endeavoured to steer between the two, assuming a little liberty with historical truth respecting Jenny and the celebrated auld Robin. The night was still, and full of fear, And all the world seem'd dead; When, pond'ring on poor Robin Gray, I went with sighs to bed. There, while my heart did heave with grief, The moon, that wand'rer pale, In at my window peep'd and shin'd So faint against the wall. I clos'd my eye in vain to sleep, And sigh'd ‘Ah! well-a-day!’ For then I dwelt on my dear love, My buried Robin Gray. As on my arm I lean'd my head, All dreary and forlorn, My hair did drink the briny tears That down my cheek did mourn. Sudden a cloud, like ink so black, The moon's pale face o'ercast; The window shook, and horror howl'd, Amid the hollow blast. The oaks that proudly look'd on high, Their lofty heads bent low, And 'midst their mighty branches roar'd, As if they scorn'd to bow. But, like a giant in his course, The storm went rushing on, Scattering their limbs and leaves so thick, As heedless what was done. Now thunder from the black cloud broke, And terrified the night, And lightnings, with a dangerous blaze, Made all the darkness bright. But my poor bleeding heat forlorn Did sink with no dismay, Since often it had wish'd to die For dear auld Robin Gray. Now did a spectre form appear, All aged, pale, and wan; And, by his visage, I could spy He was my lost auld man. Now on my bed-side did he sit, As harmless as a dove; And though he had two hollow eyes, They look'd with tend'rest love. Forth from their sockets then did rush Full many a drop of woe: So from the cave or rugged rock The pearly waters flow. ‘Jesu!’ I cry'd, and stretch'd my arms To clasp him round the waist; But nought of his poor spectre drear My longing arms embrac'd. ‘Oh! Jenny (then he said), in vain Thy arms would clasp me in; For spirits, such as thou behold'st, Have neither bones nor skin.’ Full on his visage did I gaze, All hurried with surprise; And, eager to devour each look, My soul rush'd through my eyes. Now did I strive to catch his hand, That press'd so often mine; But twas in vain—'twas nought but air, Which made my heart to pine. And yet his hands so shrivell'd were, As made of flesh and blood: But God knows best what should be done, And God is very good. ‘And art thou happy then,’ I cry'd, ‘In this thy present state?’ He smil'd like angels then, and said, ‘God well hath chang'd my fate. ‘Let innocence, O Jane, be thine, And peace shall dwell with thee; And when just Heaven shall call thee hence, With Robin thou shalt be.’ With that he look'd a sweet farewel, And rais'd each wetted eye; Then glided off, and, as he went, I heard the kindest sigh. ‘Adieu!’ I cry'd, half chok'd with grief, ‘Soul of my soul, adieu! My bosom throbs to leave this world, And thy dear flight pursue. ‘But Robin, Robin, stay awhile; Ah! stay awhile,’ I said— ‘As Jemmy is come home from sea, May I with Jemmy wed?’ But Robin answer'd not a word, But off his ghost did go; Which made me wonder—but perhaps His ghost had answer'd, ‘No.’ Auld Robin's kindnesses to me, Whilst we in love did live, Deserve more streams from these sad eyes, Than they have drops to give. The evening that he sought his grave, Did wear a dismal gloom; And all who did the burying see, With eyes so red went home. The honest tribute of their tears, I thought was sweetest fame; And when I die, God grant my bier Be sprinkled with the same! The harmless children, too, in bands, Did pour their little sighs, And on the coffin near the grave They strain'd their wat'ry eyes. And when into the earth below His corpse at length was giv'n, They look'd towards each other's eyes, And sigh'd, ‘He's goue to Heaven.’ Then on his grave they sat them down, And lisp'd his name with praise, Till all the little wights did wish To be auld Robin Grays. ODE FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. Love is a pretty passion, to be sure; And long, say I indeed, may love endure! Yet now and then to Prudence should it look— Yes, take a little leaf from Wisdom's book. Our boys, alas! begin too soon to sigh, Mourn the pierc'd heart, and lay them down to die; Just like expiring swans, with tuneful breath, Sweet rhiming in the agonies of death. Too soon the girls abuse of pens the nib, And pour their little groaning souls on paper: Love should not come till Time removes the bib; Misses should learn to walk before they caper. Love, though it deals in sweets, has many sours; It does not always furnish happy hours, Putting us oft in dismal situations: The novelty sets people's souls a longing— What thousands to their ruin thus are thronging! Indeed we see the evil in all nations. I fear Love does at times a deal of harm: It keeps the world alive, it is confess'd; So far, indeed, I like the pleasing charm— Yet, yet, through Love, what thousands are distress'd! ‘Give me,’ exclaims the youth, ‘but heav'nly kissing, And lo, I seek nought else—for nought is missing: Let me for ever dwell on Chloe's lip; On Chloe's bosom let me only lie; There pour in sweetest ecstasy the sigh, And, like the bee, the honey'd treasure sip. ‘I heed not fragrant wines, nor flesh, nor fish; Chloe is all I want, and all I wish!’ And thus again the raptur'd nymph exclaims, ‘Sweet are of Love the sighs, and dear the flames! Love smiles away the dark'ning clouds of life: Love feels no rains, nor storms, nor pinching cold: Love wants not fire nor candle, meat, clothes, gold: All bliss is center'd in that one word—wife.’ THE OWL AND PARROT. An owl fell desp'rately in love, poor soul! Sighing and hooting in his lonely hole— A parrot the dear object of his wishes, Who in her cage enjoy'd the loaves and fishes, In short had all she wanted—meat and drink, Washing and lodging—full enough, I think. ‘Squire Owl most musically tells his tale; His oaths, his squeezes, kisses, sighs, prevail: Poll cannot bear, poor heart, to hear him grieve; So opes her cage, without a ‘By your leave;’ Are married, go to bed with raptur'd faces, Rich words, and so forth—usual in such cases. A day or two pass'd amorously sweet; Love, kissing, cooing, billing, all their meat: At length they both felt hungry—‘What's for dinner? Pray what have we to eat, my dear?’ quoth Poll.— ‘Nothing! by all my wisdom,’ answer'd Owl; I never thought of that, as I'm a sinner; ‘But, Poll, on something I shall put my pats— What say'st thou, deary, to a dish of rats?’ ‘Rats, Mister Owl! d'ye think that I'll eat rats? Eat them yourself, or give them to the cats,’ Whines the poor bride, now bursting into tears.— ‘Well, Polly, would you rather dine on mouse? I'll catch a few, if any in the house; Thou shalt not starve, love, so dispel thy fears.’ ‘I won't eat rats—I won't eat mice—I won't: Don't tell me of such dirty vermin—don't: O that within my cage I had but tarried!’ ‘Polly,’ quoth Owl, ‘I'm sorry, I declare, So delicate, you relish not our fare— You should have thought of that before you married.’ This fable aptly also will apply To Frenchmen—sans-culottes-men. Ah! how? why? The French are changeful fellows, all must grant; Cameleons—but, ah! changing for the worse: Poor ignorants, scarce knowing what they want; Bart'ring too often blessings for a curse. All good, in one word, Novelty, they see! So strong within them is of change the leaven: A Frenchman's flutt'ring soul would feel ennui Ev'n midst the blessed constancy of Heaven! AN ANACREONTIC. TO A KISS. Soft child of love—thou balmy bliss, Inform me, O delicious kiss, Why thou so suddenly art gone? Lost in the moment thou art won? Yet go—for wherefore should I sigh? On Delia's lip, with raptur'd eye, On Delia's blushing lip I see A thousand full as sweet as thee. A TRANSLATION Of the preceding Imperial Panegyric on Tea. The flow'r mehó is not so bright, And yet it gives the eye delight; It likewise has a charming smell: The pines, too, are a pretty fruit, That much indeed my palate suit, And much in flavour, too, excel. Get an old kettle, if you please, For such a thing is found with ease, That has three legs—and therefore shows Its ancient services;—then fill With water, and, what's best, the rill, The lucid rill, from melted snows. Heat in this kettle, to your wish, The water fit to boil a fish, Or turn the blackest lobster red; Pour then the water on the tea, Then drink it, and 'twill drive, d'ye see, All the blue devils from your head. Far from the toil of state affairs I steal away, to drown my cares, For which I take of tea a cup; And then I snap the rich fochu, Fine to the taste, and to the view; And then again the tea I sup. Now on the rare mehó I gaze; Now of the ancients, with amaze, I think—and also with delight; And now upon the great Otsén, The best and frugallest of men, Who liv'd on pine from morn to night. With envy on this mighty man I think! And then I drink: Then I crack nuts, and eat the kernels too; Then think on that great gard'ner, great Linfou. When, lo! I pass from great Linfou To that great prince, yclept Tchao-tcheou;— Then upon You-tchouan I ponder: Thus do I sit, and eat, and drink, and wonder. The first, my fancy plainly sees Surrounded by all sorts of trees; Now tasting this rich fruit, now that so fine: I mark the second quaffing the rich water; But, knowing very little of the matter, Thank Heav'n his vulgar taste was never mine. I hear, I hear the evening drum, Sounding aloud, ‘Go to bed, Tom!’ Good me! how pleasant is the starry night! Lo, on each dish, and silver spoon, And plate, and porringer, the moon Peeps through my tent with friendly light. Now, this is charming, I must own; My stomach, too, so easy grown! And now I'll take a nap—thus ends my song, Compos'd by me (a humble bard) Kien Long. ODE TO COFFEE. In the Manner of Kien Long. Delicious berry, but, ah! best When from the Eastern Ind, not West; Nought richer is, I think, than thee:— Into a roaster, with my hand, I put thee, and then o'er thee stand, And then I catch thy smell with glee. And now I shake thee round about; And, when turn'd brown, I take thee out, And then I put thee in a mill; And, when to powder thou art crush'd, Into a tin pot thou art push'd, To feel the boiling smoking rill. And now from my tin pot's long nose The fragrant fluid sweetly flows; And now I put the lily cream, And sugar too, the best of brown; And, happy, now I gulp thee down Keeping my nose upon the steam. On Hastings now my senses work; And now on virtuous Edmund Burke, Who calmly let Sir Thomas 'scape: And then unto myself I say, ‘Is Honour dead? ah, well-a-day!’ And then my mouth begins to gape. Now on Sir Joseph Banks I ponder, And now at his rare merit wonder, In flies and tadpoles deep; And now to many a drowsy head I hear the drowsy Blagdon Sir Joseph's right hand, and secretary to the Royal Society; who has very often read the very respectable meetings of the Royal Society to slumber. read, And then I fall asleep. ODE. [When Flatt'ry sings, Age opes his eyes so clear] When Flatt'ry sings, Age opes his eyes so clear, And claps so brisk the trumpet to his ear, So wondrously inspir'd he lists, and sees! When Flatt'ry sings, pale Colic's pains are off; Consumption pants not, but forgets his cough; And Asthma's loaded lungs forbear to wheeze. Stung is the soul with Hyp's rope-off'ring evils? Flatt'ry's a talisman to drive the devils. Sweet on the list'ning ear of stilly Night, As warbling dieth Philomela's song; So on the ear of man, with rich delight, The lulling music flows from Flatt'ry's tongue. Show me the man, and I will thank thee for it, Who says, with truth, ‘Poh! Flatt'ry! I abhor it.’— 'Tis a non-descript—by Sir Joseph bred— A Soho monster, born without a head. Flatt'ry's a perfect mistress of her art; With picklock keys to open ev'ry heart. What mortal can withstand the fire of Flatt'ry? No one! 'tis such a most successful batt'ry. No head, however thick, resists its shot; Yet each pretends to mock it!—what a sot! SUSAN AND THE SPIDER. ‘Come down, you toad,’ cry'd Susan to a spider, High on the gilded cornice a proud rider, And, wanton, swinging by his silken rope; ‘I'll teach thee to spin cobwebs round the room; You're now upon some murder, I presume— I'll bless thee—if I don't, say I'm no pope.’ Then Susan brandish'd her long brush, Determin'd on a fatal push, To bring the rope-dancer to ground, And all his schemes of death confound. The spider, blest with oratory grace, Slipp'd down, and, staring Susan in the face, ‘Fie, Susan! lurks there murder in that heart? O barb'rous, lovely Susan! I'm amaz'd! O can that form, on which so oft I've gaz'd, Possess of cruelty the slightest part? ‘Ah! can that swelling bosom of delight, On which I've peep'd with wonder many a night, Nay, with these fingers touch'd too, let me say, Contain a heart of cruelty?—no, no! That bosom, which exceeds the new-fall'n snow, All softness, sweetness, one eternal May.’ ‘How!’ Susan screech'd, as with disorder'd brain— ‘How, Impudence! repeat those words again: Come, come, confess with honesty—speak, speak, Say, did you really crawl upon my neck?’ ‘Susan, by all thy heav'nly charms, I did; I saw thee sleeping by the taper's light; Thy cheek, so blushful, and thy breast so white: I could not stand it, and so down I slid.’ ‘You did, sweet Mister Spider? so you saw!’ ‘Yes, Susan! Nature's is a pow'rful law.’ ‘Arn't you a murd'rer?’ gravely Susan cries; ‘Arn't you for ever busy with that claw, Killing poor unoffending little flies, Merely to satisfy your nasty maw?’ ‘But, Susan, don't you feed on gentle lamb? Don't you on pretty little pigeons cram? Don't you on harmless fishes often dine?’ ‘That's very true,’ quoth Susan, ‘true indeed; Lord! with what eloquence these spiders plead! This little rascal beats a grave divine. ‘It was no snake, I verily believe, But a sly spider that seduc'd poor Eve. ‘But then you are so ugly.’—‘Ah! sweet Sue, I did not make myself, you know too well: Could I have made myself, I had been you, And kill'd with envy ev'ry beauteous belle.’ ‘Heav'ns! to this spider!—what a 'witching tongue Well! go about thy business—go along; All animals indeed their food must get: And hear me—shouldst thou look, with longing eyes, At any time on young, fat, luscious flies, I'll drive the little rascals to thy net. ‘Lord! then how blind I've been to form and feature! I think a spider, now, a comely creature! VERSES TO A WHITE SATIN PETTICOAT, Belonging to Miss Molly M?, But spoiled by the Author's inadvertent Stupidity, in throwing on it a Cup of Coffee. O fair protectress of the fairest maid, How shall the poet for his crime atone? So lately blest as thou, I'm sore afraid I have no recompense to offer!—none! But Molly parts with thee with pitying eye! Then from this moment do not dare complain: Nay, more—the nymph surveys thee with a sigh— Then boast!—the envy thou, of ev'ry swain. THE TINKER, AND MILLER'S DAUGHTER. A TALE. The meanest creature somewhat may contain, As Providence ne'er makes a thing in vain. Upon a day, a poor and trav'ling tinker, On Fortune's various tricks a constant thinker, Pass'd in some village near a miller's door; Where, lo! his eye did most astonish'd catch The miller's daughter peeping o'er the hatch, Deform'd, and monstrous ugly, to be sure. Struck with th' uncommon form, the tinker started, Just like a frighten'd horse, or murd'rer carted, Up gazing at the gibbet and the rope: Turning his brain about, in a brown study (For, as I've said, his brain was not so muddy), ‘'Sbud! (quoth the tinker) I have now some hope; ‘Fortune, the jade, is not far off, perchance’— And then began to rub his hands, and dance. Now all so full of love, o'erjoy'd he ran, Embrac'd and squeez'd Miss Grist, and thus began: ‘My dear, my soul, my angel, sweet Miss Grist, Now may I never mend a kettle more, If ever I saw one like you before!’ Then, ‘nothing loth,’ like Eve, the nymph he kiss'd. Now, very sensibly indeed, Miss Grist Thought opportunity should not be miss'd; Knowing that prudery oft lets slip a joy: Thus was Miss Grist too prudent to be coy. For really 'tis with girls a dangerous farce, To flout a swain, when offers are but scarce. She did not scream, and cry, ‘I'll not be woo'd; ‘Keep off, you smutty fellow—don't be rude; I'm meat for your superiors, tinker.’—No, Indeed she treated not the tinker so. But lo, the damsel, with her usual squint, Suffer'd her tinker lover to imprint Sweet kisses on her lip, and squeeze her hand, Hug her, and say the softest things unto her, And in love's plain and pretty language woo her, Without a frown, or ev'n a reprimand. Soon won, the nymph agreed to join his bed, And, when the tinker chose, to church be led. Now to the father the brisk lover hied, Who at his noisy mill so busy plied, Grinding, and taking handsome toll of corn, Sometimes indeed too handsome to be borne. ‘Ho! Master Miller!’ did the tinker say— Forth from his cloud of flour the miller came: ‘Nice weather, Master Miller—charming day— God's very kind’—the miller said the same. ‘Now, miller, possibly you may not guess At this same business I am come about: 'Tis this then—know, I love your daughter Bess:— There, Master Miller!—now the riddle's out. ‘I'm not for mincing matters, Lord! d'ye see— I likes your daughter Bess, and she likes me.’ ‘Poh!’ quoth the miller, grinning at the tinker, ‘Thou dost not mean to marriage to persuade her; Ugly as is the dev'l I needs must think her, Though, to be sure, 'tis said, 'twas me that made her. ‘No, no, though she's my daughter, I'm not blind: But, tinker, what hath now possess'd thy mind? Thou'rt the first offer she has met, by Gad— But tell me, tinker, art thou drunk, or mad?’ ‘No—I'm not drunk, nor mad,’ the tinker cry'd, ‘But Bet's the maid I wish to make my bride; No girl in these two eyes doth Bet excel.’ ‘Why, fool,’ the miller said, ‘Bet hath a hump! And then her nose!—the nose of my old pump.’ ‘I know it,’ quoth the tinker, ‘know it well.’ ‘Her face,’ quoth Grist, ‘is freckled, wrinkled, flat; Her mouth as wide as that of my Tom cat; And then she squints a thousand ways at once— Her waist, a corkscrew; and her hair how red! A downright bunch of carrots on her head— Why what the dev'l is got into thy sconce?’ ‘No dev'l is in my sconce,’ rejoin'd the tinker; ‘But, Lord! what's that to you, if fine, I think her? ‘Why, man,’ quoth Grist, ‘she's fit to make a show, And therefore sure I am that thou must banter!’ ‘Miller!’ reply'd the tinker, ‘right! for know, 'Tis for that very thing, a show, I want her.’ MELANCHOLY. HERMIONE. A sighing solitary form I roam; A tear on Nature's universal smile! Thou genius of my natal hour, whose hand Pierces my moments with the thorns of woe, When will the measure of my grief be full? When will the silent asp of hopeless love Withdraw his fang of torment from my heart? How lately joy was mine!—but where is joy, That cheerful pour'd a sunshine o'er my soul? Gone! like the last, last sun, to sink in night, Nature's last night, and gild a morn no more! Enter CAMILLA. My lov'd Hermione, I heard thy sigh, And left my sleep to soften thy affliction. Why killest thou that gentle frame with weeping? Sorrowing, thou seemest to delight in woe, And feed existence upon sighs and tears. HERMIONE. Camilla, the dread silence of the hour Suits but too well the colour of my soul. Night, who to others brings the balm of sleep, And happy dreams to sooth the peaceful breast, Pours on my wakeful eye, far diff'rent guests; The foulest, darkest demons of despair. Lorn, at the midnight hour, when all is hush'd, I wander restless; sadly now I sit, My brimfull eyes for hours both motionless, Swimming with woe, towards the passing moon, Who on me, as she lonely glides along, Casts a pale beam of melancholy light, That seems a ray of pity on my fate. THE DRUID HYMN TO THE SUN. O sacred fount of life to all! Before thy glorious beam we fall, And strike with raptur'd hand the lyre; To thee we lift our wond'ring eyes; To thee the hymn of morn shall rise, And bless thy mounting orb of fire. Chorus. Hail to that orb, from whose rich fountain flow Beams that illume and glad the world below. Unseen by thee had Nature mourn'd; No smile her Æthiop cheek adorn'd; Pale Night had spread her spectred reign, And death-like Horror rul'd the scene. Chorus. All hail the beams that night destroy, And wake an opening world to joy! Bright spreading o'er the vast of gloom, That chase the spectres to their tomb. TO CHLOE. Chloe, no more must we be billing— There goes my last, my poor last shilling: Vile Fortune bids us part! Yet, Chloe, this my bosom charms, That, when thou'rt in another's arms, I still possess thy heart. Fortune's a whimsical old dame, And possibly may blush with shame At this her freak with me: But should she smile again, and offer, Well fill'd with gold, an ample coffer, I'll send the key to thee. THE BLIND BEGGAR. Welcome, thou man of sorrows, to my door! A willing balm thy wounded heart shall find; And lo, thy guiding dog my care implores! O haste, and shelter from th' unfeeling wind. Alas! shall Mis'ry seek my cot with sighs, And humbly sue for piteous alms my ear; Yet disappointed go with lifted eyes, And on my threshold leave th' upbraiding tear? Thou bowest for the pity I bestow: Bend not to me, because I mourn distress; I am thy debtor—much to thee I owe; For learn—the greatest blessing is to bless. Thy hoary locks, and wan and pallid cheek, And quiv'ring lip to fancy seem to say, ‘A more than common beggar we bespeak; A form that once has known a happier day.’ Thy sightless orbs, and venerable beard, And press'd by weight of years, thy palsied head, Though silent, speak with tongues that must be heard, Nay, must command, if virtue be not dead. Thy shatter'd, yet thine awe-inspiring form, Shall give the village-lads the soften'd soul, To aid the victims of life's frequent storm, And smooth the surges that around them roll; Teach them, that poverty may merit shroud; And teach, that virtue may from misery spring! Flame like the lightning from the frowning cloud, That spreads on Nature's smile its raven wing. O let me own the heart which pants to bless; That nobly scorns to hide the useless store; But looks around for objects of distress, And triumphs in a sorrow for the poor! When Heaven on man is pleas'd its wealth to show'r, Ah, what an envied bliss doth Heaven bestow! To raise pale Merit in her hopeless hour, And lead Despondence from the tomb of Woe! Lo, not the little birds shall chirp in vain, And, hov'ring round me, vainly court my care; While I possess the life-preserving grain, Welcome ye chirping tribe to peck your share. How can I hear your songs at spring's return, And hear while summer spreads her golden store; Yet, when the gloom of winter bids ye mourn, Heed not the plaintive voice that charm'd before! Since Fortune, to my cottage not unkind, Strews with some flow'rs the road of life for me, Ah! can humanity desert my mind? Shall I not soften the rude flint for thee? Then welcome, beggar, from the rains and snow, And warring elements, to warmth and peace; Nay, thy companion too shall comfort know, Who shiv'ring shakes away the icy fleece. And lo, he lays him by the fire, elate; Now on his master turns his gladden'd eyes; Leaps up to greet him on their change of fate, Licks his lov'd hand, and then beneath him lies. A hut is mine, amidst a shelt'ring grove: A hermit there, exalt to Heav'n thy praise; There shall the village children show their love, And hear from thee the tales of other days. There shall our feather'd friend, the bird of morn, Charm thee with orisons to opening day; And there the red-breast, on the leafless thorn, At eve shall sooth thee with a simple lay. When fate shall call thee from a world of woe, Thy friends around shall watch thy closing eyes; With tears, behold thy gentle spirit go, And wish to join its passage to the skies. ANACREONTIC SONG. TO MY LUTE. What shade and what stillness around! Let us seek the lov'd cot of the fair; There soften her sleep with thy sound, And banish each phantom of care. The virgin may wake to thy strain, And be sooth'd, nay, be pleas'd with thy song; Alas! she may pity the swain, And fancy his sorrows too long. Could thy voice give a smile to her cheek, What a joy, what a rapture were mine! Then for ever thy fame would I speak— O my lute, what a triumph were thine! Ah! whisper kind love in her ear, And sweetly my wishes impart; Say, the swain who adores her, is near; Say, thy sounds are the sighs of his heart. A PASTORAL SONG. Farewel, O farewel to the day, That smiling with happiness flew! Ye verdures and blushes of May, Ye songs of the linnet, adieu! In tears from the vale I depart; In anguish I move from the fair: For what are those scenes to the heart Which Fortune has doom'd to despair? Love frowns, and how dark is the hour! Of rapture, departed the breath! So gloomy the grove and the bow'r, I tread the pale valley of death. With envy I wander forlorn, At the breeze which her beauty has fann'd; And I envy the bird on the thorn, Who sits watching the crumbs from her hand. I envy the lark o'er her cot, Who calls her from slumber, so blest; Nay, I envy the nightingale's note, The Syren who sings her to rest. On her hamlet, once more let me dwell— One look! the last comfort!) be mine— O pleasure, and Delia, farewel! Now, sorrow, I ever am thine. GOOD FRIDAY. Sir Harry, a high priest, and deep divine, Ambitious much 'mid modern saints to shine, On a Good Friday evening took an airing:— Not far had he proceeded, ere a sound Did the two ears of this good priest astound; Such as loud laughs, commix'd with some small swearing. Now in an orchard peep'd the knight so sly, With such a staring, rolling, phrensied eye; Where, lo! a band of rural swains were blest:— Too proud to join the crew, he wav'd his hand, Beck'ning to this unholy playful band— Forth came a boy, obedient to the priest. ‘What wicked things are ye all doing here, On this most solemn day of all the year?’ ‘Playing to skittles,’ said the simple lad: ‘Playing at skittles!—Devils, are ye mad? ‘For what?’—‘A jack-ass, sir,’ the boy replies— ‘A Jack-ass!’ roars the priest, with wolf-like eyes: ‘Run, run, and tell them Heav'n will not be shamm'd; Tell them this instant, that they'll all be damn'd.’ ‘I wull, Sir Harry—iss, I wull, Sir Harry’— Then off he set, th' important news to carry; To warn them what dread torments would ensue: But suddenly the scamp'ring lad turn'd round, And thus, with much simplicity of sound, ‘Sir Harry, must the Jack-ass be damn'd too?’ ODE TO A PRETTY BAR-MAID. Sweet nymph, with teeth of pearl, and dimpled chin, And roses that would tempt a saint to sin, Daily to thee so constant I return; Whose smile improves the coffee's ev'ry drop, Gives tenderness to ev'ry steak and chop, And bids our pockets at expenses spurn. What youth, well powder'd, of pomatum smelling, Shall on that lovely bosom fix his dwelling? Perhaps the waiter, of himself so full! With thee he means the coffee-house to quit; Open a tavern, and become a cit, And proudly keep the head of the Black Bull. 'Twas here the wits of Anna's attic age Together mingled their poetic rage; Here Prior, Pope, and Addison, and Steele; Here Parnell, Swift, and Bolingbroke, and Gay, Pour'd their keen prose, and tun'd the merry lay, Gave the fair toast, and made a hearty meal. 'Twas here, o'er fragrant coffee to unbend, The wits their epigrams so happy, penn'd, And bade in madrigals a Chloe shine; A Mira, a Belinda, and a Phillis, Who boasted roses possibly, and lilies, Such as now deck that cheek and breast of thine. Nymph of the roguish smile, which thousands seek, Give me another, and another steak, A kingdom for another steak, but giv'n By thy fair hand, that shames the snow of Heaven. Give me a glass of punch, O smiling lass, And let thy luscious lip embalm the glass— Touch it, and spread a charm around the brim: Health to thy beauties, Nancy, and may Time Ne'er meddle with thy present healthful prime, Thy ringlets spoil, and eyes of di'monds dim. Lo, from each box thy lute-ton'd voice to hear, Youth nimbly turns him round, with wanton leer; Nay, wrinkled Age himself, with locks so white, Findeth within a kind of bastard fire, Whose mouth, poor cripple, watering with desire, Opes toothless on thy beauties in delight. How for thy lamb-like flesh he seems to hunger! He feels himself a pair of ages younger! Tell me again, O nymph, whose happy arms Are doom'd, for life, to circle those bright charms, And to that bosom give brave girls and boys? That lucky lot, alas! will ne'er be mine— A gaze, a squeeze, perchance a kiss divine, Must form the bounds, O Nancy, of my joys. Yet if rich favours, far beyond a smile So kind, thy poet's moments to beguile, Thou wishest to bestow!—in Love's name give 'em; And, thankful, on my knees will I receive 'em. ANACREONTIC. SONG. Who dares talk of hours? Seize the bell of that clock; Seize his hammer, and cut off his hands: To the bottle, dear bottle, I'll stick like a rock, And obey only Pleasure's commands. Let him strike the short hours, and hint at a bed— Waiter, bring us more wine—what a whim! Say, that Time, his old master, for topers was made, And not jolly topers for him. ODE TO A HEDGE-SPARROW, NURSING A YOUNG CUCKOO. AH, whining, anxious, restless bird! Thou art a fool, upon my word: Now on the bush, and now upon the ground; Now hov'ring o'er my head, and saying Such bitter things—now begging, praying, Poor wretch, surveying me so sharp all round Imploring me to leave the nest, Where all thy dearest wishes rest. How busy thou in catching grub and fly, As soon as dewy morning paints the sky; Now twitt'ring near the nest such strains of joy, Proclaiming to the world a hopeful boy! Great is thy triumph in thy fancied child! Immense thy pride—thy ecstasy how wild! Yet not one trait of thee doth he display: Indeed thou never didst beget the youth; And more—to tell thee an unpleasant truth, His father will be here the first of May. Nor singular art thou—for, lo! A little gamesome knight we know, Who fosters children—loves them to distraction; Shows them about from morn to night, Drinking such draughts of rich delight From ev'ry feature—so much satisfaction! Sees his own eyes, own mouth, own lip, own ear, Own nose, own dimple, in each pretty dear!— But who's the real parent?—Am'rous John, Good-natur'd fellow, made them ev'ry one. TO ANACREON. Ghost of Anacreon, quit the shades, And with thee bring thy sweet old lyre; To praise the first of British maids, Whose charms will set thy soul on fire. But hold—'twere better keep away— Of justice must thy heart despair; Which suited very well thy day, That saw no damsel half so fair. THE CAPTIVE QUEEN.The Lines are supposed to be spoken by a Friend of the unfortunate Antoinette. With radiance rose thy morning sun, Fair promise of a happy day; But, luckless, ere it reach'd its noon, The fiend of darkness dimm'd the ray. What though the brightest gifts are thine, And distant nations pour thy praise; While, raptur'd, on thy form divine The eyes of Love and Wonder gaze? The voice of Joy, for ever mute, Must yield to sighs that mourn in vain; And Pity, come with sweetest lute, To sooth thy sorrows with her strain. The syren Hope, who won thy ear, Must charm no more the dangerous hour; The warning voice of ravens, hear, That croak thy doom on yonder tow'r. Yet what is life, 'mid Horror's reign, Where Murder's triumph cleaves the sky; Where heaves with death the groaning scene, And dungeons loud for vengeance cry? Yet what is life to spotless fame? And thine to latest time shall bloom— The blow that sinks that beauteous frame Gives all the virtues to the tomb. ANACREONTIC. Fie, Sylvia! why so gravely look Because a kiss or two I took? Those luscious lips might thousands grant— Rich rogues that never feel the want. So little in a kiss I see, A hundred thou mayst take from me. But since, like misers o'er their store, Thou hat'st to give, though running o'er; I scorn to cause the slightest pain, So pr'ythee take them back again; Nay, with good int'rest be it done— Thou'rt welcome to take ten for one. TO TIME. O time, 'tis childish, let me say, To give, then take a grace away; The damsel from her charms to sever, So pleas'd to keep them all for ever. When Cynthia tires with conqu'ring hearts And says, ‘O Time, receive my darts;’ Her beauties are a lawful prize— Then take the lightnings of her eyes. Pluck all the roses from her cheek, And root the lilies from her neck; Her dimples seize, her smile, her air, And with them make a thousand fair. ODE TO JEALOUSY. A vaunt, thou squinting hag, whose list'ning ear Seizes on ev'ry whisper—whose owl's eye, When Night's dark mantle wraps the silent sphere, Stares watchful of each form that passeth by! Thou fiend, what bus'ness hast thou here on earth, Dissension-breeder, from thy very birth? How much more of the serpent than the dove! I cannot guess thine errand to this world— By thee is Nature topsy-turvy hurl'd! And nearly ruin'd the soft land of Love! Speak I but to my neighbour's wife so kind, And say, ‘Pray how d'ye do, my dearest ma'am?’ Behold, a tempest swells the husband's mind, Who gives my sweet civility a d?mn: For, lo, thy wickedness at once adorns His trembling temples with a brace of horns. The instant thou behold'st a married pair, Adieu, alas! the pleasures of the fair! Farewel, of Benedick, the wedded bliss! Scarce canst thou let the honey-moon go by, When, hark! the keen reproach!—the lady's sigh! Dead the fond squeeze, and mute the chirping kiss! ‘Watch him’—thou whisper'st in the woman's ear, ‘Open his letters—pick his pockets, ma'am— Somewhat will be discover'd, never fear; Something to dash the monster's cheek with shame. ‘Ken him amid the harlots at the play; Nor let your eyes a single moment stray: He catches a lewd squint, if yours are blinkers: Make him look straight on, forward to the stage; And, on refusal, tell him, in a rage, You'll give him, coach-horse like, a pair of winkers.’ ANACREONTIC. O far from me those lightnings dart; On others bid thy beauty shine: Beyond the hopes of this sad heart, I view that peerless form, to pine. Whilst ev'ry shepherd sings her praise, 'Tis mine of Sylvia to complain; Made a poor pris'ner while I gaze, I feel in ev'ry smile a chain. ODE TO THE LADIES OF ENGLAND. Peter more than suspecteth, that a few Passages of his Works have given Offence to his fair Countrywomen. —Peter's Contrition thereat, and violent Resolution. Ladies, I should be sorry—griev'd indeed, Could I once write what you would blush to read; But that same poet clepped Jean Fontaine Was verily the taste and admiration Of all the ladies of the Gallic nation, Quoted and toasted o'er and o'er again. What! wound of British maids the tender ear, Who, when to nymphs of other realms compar'd (And lo, on numbers have these eye-balls star'd), Are, as rich Burgundy to dead small beer! Our poet Pope, against a naughty word Protested—seeming too to shut his door; Pronouncing all obscenity absurd— That ribaldry was folly—nothing more: Yet Master Pope, who Decency so flatters, Plumps boldly into certain wicked matters. Now this I do dislike in Master Pope— At gluttony a man should never bark, On dainties, who is pleas'd his mouth to ope, And guttling swallow plates-full like a shark. Miss Heloïse, that warm young lass, I ween, Says things that cover Modesty with shame: I must confess I never saw nineteen Pour such an Ætna forth of am'rous flame. And lo, again—the Lock, the ravish'd Lock! Too oft the lines give Modesty a shock: Warm inuendos bid her blushes rise: Yes, often I've heard Modesty declare ‘That many a line indeed has made her stare; She knew not where to look—where fix her eyes.’ The Wife of Bath, and eke the lovely May, Held language horrid for our chaster day. Were Peter now to sing in such a style, What lady-mouth would yield the bard a smile? No!—frowns would fill their faces in its stead. And yet, ye dames so chaste, those tales are read— I see no lips with blushing anger ope, And cry, ‘I loath the nasty leaves of Pope.’ Nay more, my dear young misses, and grave dames, Who read with fear my songs of darts amd flames; Speak—is not Pope an idol 'mid your books; Does not Saint Patrick's Dean, so void of grace, Among your leathern fav'rites show his face, Whose many a leaf should only lodge with cooks? Since then the lightnings of the ladies' eyes Knock not the mem'ries of those poets down, It striketh me indeed with huge surprise, That Peter's purer line should feel a frown. They wounded Modesty with verse unchaste; I with a twig of Pindus scarcely struck her: They stripp'd her naked—I just clasp'd her waist, And delicately only touch'd her tucker. Yet is there, is there one sweet British prude, Who will not read my rhimes—mistrusting harm? Let not my volumes on the nymph intrude, And ring to Chastity the wild alarm; Make in her pretty panting heart a riot, Demanding months to bring it back its quiet. Tales of a damsel kind, and sighing lover, Holding of Love's choice spice a little, Might be indulg'd to warm Dame Nature's kettle, But not to bid it boil tempestuous over. Ev'n Age delighteth in an am'rous tale; Love warms his inside like a pot of ale; Thaws his cold heart, and makes it beat so cheery! His eyes, that, owl-like, wink'd upon the day, Burst open with a keen and twinkling ray, And, lo! he hugs and kisses his old deary. Why then forbid them?—such we must approve: And woe to mortals who are foes to Love! As long as this our system holds together, Love will stand brush, against all wind and weather. Yet should my fav'rite British maids and dames Refuse to read my rhimes on darts and flames, And other pretty little trifling things, The fount from which such nat'ral rapture springs; Ladies of France, I think my song To you in future must belong: Yes, yes, for you the bard shall form the strain— And then, who knows? it may be so, I wot, The dames may cry, ‘Those islanders have got, Ye gods! an absolute Fontaine. ‘Refuse to read him!—no, Heav'n bless him!—no: Lord! let his wild imagination flow— Banish the Loves!—O what a Gothic sweep! The world at once, so dull, would fall asleep!’ So help me, Grace! I ever meant to please— Ev'n now would I ask pardon on my knees: If aught I've sinn'd, the stanza must not live— Bring me the knife—I'll cut the wanton page, Which puts my lovely readers in a rage: But hark! they cry, ‘Barbarian, we forgive.’ A thousand thanks t'ye all, my charming creatures; What goodness, kindness, reigns in female natures! TO CYNTHIA. What danger lurks in those bright eyes! Lo, by their fire thy poet dies: Yet bravely let me meet my doom— And since to thee I owe my death, I beg thee, with my parting breath, To let thy bosom be my tomb. ANACREONTIC. Ah! wherefore did I daring gaze Upon the radiance of thy charms? And, vent'ring nearer to their rays, How dar'd I clasp thee in my arms? That kiss will give my heart a pain, Which thy sweet pity will deplore: Then, Cynthia, take the kiss again, Or let me take ten thousand more. THE LADY'S LAP DOG AND THE COACHMAN. CHLOE, a fav'rite of a rich old dame, Was vastly delicate in all her frame; Could put down nought at last, but nice tid-bits: Nay oft, with much solicitation too, Her mistress was oblig'd to kiss and woo, For fear poor tender Chloe might have fits. Fat was our Chloe—like a ball of grease; So round, a foot-ball quite, and fair her fleece. Oft on the Turkey carpet as she lay, And sleep o'er Chloe's eye-lids did prevail; 'Twas very very difficult to say Which was her head indeed, and which her tail. At length it came to pass, that Chlo’ Did sullenness and sickness show; So heavy leaving off her wanton capers; Gap'd, stretch'd, and lethargy she likewise show'd, Was sick at stomach (may I dare say sp?w'd?) And seem'd, poor dog, afflicted with the vapours. My lady took her pining to her arms, Hugg'd her, and kiss'd her, full of sad alarms, Fearing her poor dear little soul would die: Chloe was all stupidity and lumpish; Scarce lick'd her hand—so sullen and so mumpish, Nor scarcely rais'd the white of either eye. The coachman's call'd—‘O Jehu, Chloe's ill; Quite lost her appetite—she has no will To move, or say, poor soul, a single thing: Jehu, what can the matter be—d'ye know?’ ‘I think, my lady, I could cure Miss Chlo.’— ‘Dear Jehu, what delicious news you bring! ‘Take her, then—take her, Jehu, to your room, And from her spirits drive this ugly gloom, And get her pretty appetite again.’ ‘O good my lady, never, never fear; I understand her case—'tis very clear; By Heav'n's assistance, I sha'nt work in vain.’ Now to his room the coachman bore Miss Bitch, Who, looking back all wistful, felt no itch To go with Jehu—still he bears her on:— Arriv'd, kind Jehu offers her a bone. Miss Chloe in a passion seeks the door: In vain—'tis shut—she lays her on the floor, And whines—gets up, all restless—looks about; Watches the door so sly, and cocks her ears; So pleas'd and nimble at each sound she hears, In hopes (vain hopes, alas!) of getting out. Chloe, like lightning, now resolves to pass, Bounce from her gaoler, through a pane of glass, And, by a leap, no more in prison groan; But, fearing she might spoil her pretty chops, Nay, break her neck by chamber-window hops, Chloe most wisely lets the leap alone. Jehu now offer'd her a piece of liver: ‘Chloe, do you love liver?’ Jehu said— ‘The devil take,’ she seem'd to say, ‘the giver:’ So hurt the dog appear'd—then turn'd her head. ‘Well, Chloe, well—Heav'n mend your proud digestion; To-morrow I shall ask you the same question.’ The morrow (ah! a sulky morrow) came: Chloe scarce slept a single wink all night: Whining and groaning, longing much to bite; Calling in vain upon my lady's name. ‘Well, Chloe, can you taste your liver?’—‘No, No, thank ye, Jehu.’—‘Leave it, pretty Chlo.’ The day pass'd on—no eating? not a crumb. Miss Chloe crawl'd about the room, so sad, Sulky and disappointed, angry, mad; Now moaning, now upon her rump so dumb, At times, around on barb'rous Jehu squinting; Such looks! not much good will to Jehu, hinting. Another morning came—a liver meal— ‘Chloe, how stands your stomach? how d'ye feel? ‘Jehu, I will not eat?’—Jehu goes out— What does Miss Chloe?—With a nimble pace, Runs to the liver, without saying grace, Gobbling away, with appetite so stout; For now the liver seem'd to meet her wish, And, not half satisfy'd, she lick'd the dish! Jehu returns, and smiles—Chloe grows good; Takes civilly a slice of musty bread; Rejects from Jehu's hand no kind of food; Glad on a rind of Cheshire to be fed. Jehu with Chloe to my lady goes, And, triumphing, his little patient shows; Not once discovering the coarse mode of cure— Jehu had lost his place then to be sure. My lady presses Chloe to her breast, Half crazy, hugging, kissing her—so blest To see her fav'rite Chloe's chang'd condition: ‘Thank ye, good Jehu—Heav'ns, what skill is in ye!’ Then into Jehu's hand she slips a guinea, And Jehu's thought a very fine physician. ODE TO THE POET DELILLE. Peter kindly congratulateth his Brother Poet on his lucky Deliverance from a Dungeon, and asketh him Questions concerning his poetical Feelings—Whether he meaneth to exalt Convention, and debase poor Britain?—Peter adviseth the contrary, and telleth the Poet unpleasant Truths, with a witty Comparison.—Peter painteth, with the Pencil of a great Master, the Portrait of a Frenchman, in which, Impudence, Insolence, Ignorance, and savage Cruelty, form the predominant Features. Thrice welcome from thy dungeon, poor Delille! Imprison'd, much (I guess) against thy will, By that unfeeling tyrant Roberspierre: Set free from this same death-encircled vault By one (I fear me!) not without a fault; In short—I mean as great a rogue, Barrere. Dead is all dalliance with the muse, I wonder: The guillotine's high flood must damp thy fire: The axe, which falls upon its prey in thunder, Must bid thee touch with trembling hand the lyre. But bards, like birds, can seldom cease from singing: Yes, on the muse's bells thou must be ringing; Thou wilt indulge the fascinating chime, Deaf to the oracle that cries ‘Don't rhime.’ Speak—wilt thou praise Convention for its pow'r, Swear Britain soon beneath its might must cow'r, Just like the wren beneath the eagle's wing? Say, no such thing. However grating to a Frenchman's ears, We Britons, I protest, have no such fears: France, to be sure, is huge—our island little— Yet spare upon our heads th' insulting spittle. The colony of teeth, though small, Are little folks of resolution; And when upon their prey they fall, Do a vast deal of execution. I do assure thee, my inquiring eyes Have found the lubbers of the largest size. 'Tis pleasant to behold a Frenchman gape On the world's map: Astonish'd on his view to see advance Regions like France! Thus I presume the solitary mole Deems the wide universe within his hole. Yet let Monsieur, so happy, prate away; 'Tis pity undeceive the popinjay. Let the pert tripping prig pronounce with pride, Barbarian, savage, all the world beside; It is his narrow nature—cease then blame: In Afric I have seen on trees the apes Mocking at man, with grins and antic shapes, Who of our species thought the very same. But thou shouldst show more sense, my friend Delille: Then pr'ythee take from me a little pill; Perhaps 'tis somewhat bitter—never mind it: It cureth puppyism—I hope thou'lt find it. Pride not thyself because a Frenchman born; Thy fame is then upon the hope forlorn; Doom'd not far distant ages to explore: Learn to despise thy Country—'tis a fool, Cruel, and of Hypocrisy's dark school, Tyrannic, savage, rotten at the core. So much for France—forgive me, lucky bard— But Vice should ever meet his fair reward: Yes, let me drag the monster from his den— This trifling ode perchance may rouse thy gall; If angry, bid thy rage on Justice fall, The goodly goddess who now guides my pen. TRANSLATION FROM GALLUS. At morn, if Cynthia meet my sight, 'Tis sweet Aurora's blushing light; And if at eve she cross my way, The star of Venus darts its ray. A SECOND ODE TO THE POET DELILLE. Peter proposeth very important Questions, and suspecteth Monsieur Delille of an Inclination to whitewash the black Faces of Devils.—Peter giveth a sublime Description of French Liberty. —Peter putteth Delille in Mind of Nature's niggard Allowance to every Man of one head only, and of an Inconvenience arising from the Loss of it, on Account of the Difficulty of procuring another.—Peter sagely adviseth him to beware of Barrere, and think of a Return to his Dungeon. —Peter picturesquely describeth the Supports of French Liberty—foretelleth the humbled State of the mighty Reformers.—Peter objecteth not to a general Intellectual Illumination, but seemeth to think that a Frenchman's Attempt must produce only a national Conflagration; Peter thus fancying every Frenchman a mad Quixote.—Peter again kindly inviteth his Brother Bard to England, and concludeth with a flaming Trait of Barrere. Who that could save his ship, would suffer wreck? Who warble with a rope about his neck? Who in the tiger's mouth would keep his head, With pow'r to draw it from a place so dread? Who, 'midst the charnel's melancholy glooms, Would mingle with the refuse of the tombs, With legs to bear him to the fragrant day, From reeking bones, and Horror's haunt, away? And yet thy song may stay perhaps to bless A dark divan of devils—yes, Full of their deeds may flow the flatt'ring rhime; Which song may stoutly swear that ‘Athens, Rome, Ne'er rais'd to Liberty an equal dome, So sacred, so stupendous, so divine!’ Yet what is it to Reason's sober eye? A monstrous slaughter-house that taints the sky: Within a day—perchance one little hour, Thy courteous song, which sooths with sweetest sound, Turn'd by the people's thunder—will be found, All of a sudden, vinegar so sour! What is the madding million's shouting breath? Black Murder's orgies—the wild howl of death! Then quit thy country—yes, disclaim thy mother: Mind!—on thy shoulders stands one simple head; Mind me, but one—and when that one is fled, 'Twill puzzle thee, I think, to get another. Since, then, this head is not yet gone, Take Peter's counsel, man, and keep it on. Barrere's red paws are ready now to start; Perhaps to plunge in thy devoted heart. Lo, at his voice (to Satan's near akin) The dungeon gapes perhaps to let thee in; Opes his dark jaws, amid the spectred gloom, For thee, a second time to raise thy moan, Breathe the vain wish, and heave the helpless groan— Thou'lt be well furnish'd both with time and room. The columns of your liberty, Death knows, Are cannon, swords, and bayonets, and spears; The angels who this glorious pile compose, Hyænas, tigers, jackalls, wolves and bears: Instead of adamant for a foundation, The groaning carcasses of half the nation. Dread, of Adversity the humbling pow'r— Sharp are her whips of wire, and hard her bats: What sad humility awaits the hour When lordly lions grind poor mice with cats! When Jove's own eagle leaves his sky for bogs, Cracks snails with crows, and feasts with croaking frogs! Yet this, you wondrous men must do ere long, If Truth (who seldom fails) awaits my song. Yes, be illumin'd, rev'rend age and youth; With you I'd tear up Superstition's root, Dark fiend! who from the sacred hand of Truth Dares snatch her torch, and crush it under foot. This were Dame Wisdom's act; but, let me add, Wisdom and France are foes—for France is mad. What voice to reason can a Frenchman bring? Go, bid with lullaby the tiger sleep; Bind with a spider's web, the whirlwind's wing; And with the wren's small plume, keep down the deep. Wrap the black surge within thy hand, so wise, And smother its wild thunder on the skies. Pr'ythee take counsel, man, and haste away: 'Tis vastly safer, I assure thee, here, Since Murder is the order of the day, And venom feeds the heart of black Barrere. Barrere! who, when in H?ll he shows his face, Each frighten'd dev'l at once will fly the place. FROM ANACREON. UPON HIMSELF. On fragrant myrtles let me lie, And Love, my slave, the wine supply. Too soon we seek the Stygian gloom: Time flies; and, since to dust we go, Why idly bid the incense flow, And spill the juice upon the tomb? Ah! rather let me quaff the wine, And bid the rose my brows entwine, While youth, while health the bosom warms— Then pr'ythee, Love, delight my heart, Ere Death dispatch his certain dart, And bring a Chloe to my arms. MAY DAY. The daisies peep from ev'ry field, And vi'lets sweet their odour yield; The purple blossom paints the thorn, And streams reflect the blush of morn. Then lads and lasses all, be gay, For this is Nature's holiday. Let lusty Labour drop his flail, Nor woodman's hook a tree assail; The ox shall cease his neck to bow, And Clodden yield to rest, the plough. Then lads, &amp;c. Behold the lark in ether float, While rapture swells the liquid note! What warbles he, with merry cheer? ‘Let Love and Pleasure rule the year? Then lads, &amp;c. Lo, Sol looks down, with radiant eye, And throws a smile around his sky; Embracing hill and vale and stream, And warming Nature with his beam. Then lads, &amp;c. The insect tribes in myriads pour, And kiss with Zephyr ev'ry flow'r; Shall these our icy hearts reprove, And tell us we are foes to Love? Then lads, &amp;c. PHILLIDA'S COMPLAINT. What has estranged thy affections from me? What have I done, that I should lose thee? But thou art tired with the object that loves thee; possibly, because her sole happiness is founded on thine. SONG. WHEN Night spreads her shadows around, I will watch with delight on thy rest; I will soften thy bed on the ground, And thy cheek shall recline on my breast. Love heeds not the storm, and the rain; On me, let their fury descend: This bosom shall scorn to complain, While it shelters the life of a friend. What tempts thee to wander away? To another, ah! dost thou depart? Believe me, in time thou wilt say, None e'er lov'd thee like Phillida's heart. Though resolv'd from a mourner to fly; To mem'ry thou still shalt be dear: The winds shall oft waft thee a sigh, And the ocean convey thee a tear. A THIRD ODE TO THE POET DELILLE. The Lyric Bard proclaimeth the Folly of the present French.—Adviseth them not to harbour Passions degrading to Humanity.—Peter, with wonderful Fancy portrayeth Prudence and Passion. —Peter taketh the Part of the late unfortunate Monarch and his Queen, and endeth his Ode with a beautiful and apt Comparison.— The Poet then illustrateth the Actions of the French by a most apposite Tale. Delille, the world from laugh can scarce refrain— Most Samson-like, ye've ruin'd a rare pile: To see you building thus, all hands, again, On an owl's face so grave must plant a smile. Sorrow discard thy weeds, and dry thy tears— Pity, disdain t'embalm them with thy breath: They're sinking!—lo, if aught like life appears, 'Tis Health's stol'n rose upon the cheek of Death. Once happiness was yours, my friend, indeed— ‘We'll have no more on't,’ mad ye cry'd, ‘away! Change! change! we'll cut off the great nation's head, And try what the huge trunk will say.’ Off goes the head— The nation's dead! Well, now 'tis done—the head is off—what then? Ye seem to stare, like disappointed men. Where was Dame Foresight? Ah, ye silly folk! And yet it is too serious for a joke. Since, then, the head is off; for freedom panting, What is't ye look for?—‘Lord, Dame Freedom's wanting; Into a terrible mistake we fall— For Tyranny's hard irons load us all!’ Indeed! ye just have found the secret out! Ye're wiser than ye were, good folks, no doubt! Alter not things when rul'd by passion—Why? Because good Madam Prudence is not nigh: Prudence keeps company that's vastly sober; Prudence is mildly-breathing, smiling May, So full of balmy blossoms, all so gay; Passion, the mad, wide-wasting, wild October. Prudence, a pretty, pleasing, stealing rill, Winning with easy lapse its winding course; Passion, a torrent rough, from hill to hill, Tumbling and tearing, drowning man and horse. Prudence is also a fresh-water eel, So calmly gliding through the liquid glass; Passion, a porpus—tempests at his heel, Flound'ring amid old Ocean's thund'ring mass. Prudence is that small pleasing worm of light, The mild hedge-regent of the dewy night; A little moon to many an insect race, Who by her silv'ry radiance find their way, Nibble the fairest flow'rs, and sip and play, Gaze on their loves, dance, ogle, and embrace. Passion's a meteor, skipping here and there; Hopping o'er hedge and ditch, and fen and pool, Amidst his wild and fierce and mad career, Making himself indeed a downright fool: And after all, what is this thing of caper? A simple child of stinking mud and vapour! Why so enrag'd against poor Louis Seize, Who pliable did every thing to please? And why in league against his charming queen, Revenge, and Madness, Malice, Envy, Spleen? Revenge's company for ever shun: Too much of danger frequently appears; A kind of weak and overloaded gun, Bursting with horrid crash about our ears. Ridiculous the triumph will be found, When, for a penny's worth, we lose a pound. The monarch eat a little of the state— But should ye therefore madly give him fate? We should not rage for trifling matters, And blust'ring kick the world about; It shows the folly of our natures, For a pin's head to make a rout. Lord! grant a little fungus on the vine And olive, yielding oil and juice and gladness; Who'd root up the whole tree for't? nought but swine— 'Twere idiotism, stupidity, and madness. The following simple well-known story shows What sad misfortune from such folly flows. THE KNIGHT AND THE RATS. A KNIGHT liv'd in the west not long ago Like knights in general, not o'erwise, I trow— This knight's great barn was visited by rats, In spite of poison, gins, and owls, and cats: Like millers, taking toll of the sweet corn, Carous'd they happily from night to morn. Lo, waxing wrath, that neither gins nor cats, Nor owls, nor poison, could destroy the rats; ‘I'll nab them by a scheme, by heav'ns,’ quoth he: So of his neighbourhood he rous'd the mob, Farmers and farmers' boys, to do this job; His servants too of high and low degree; And eke the tribes of dog, by sound of horn, To kill the rats that dar'd to taste the corn. This done, the knight, resolv'd with god-like ire, Ran to his kitchen for a stick of fire, From whence intrepid to the barn he ran; Much like the Macedonian and fair punk, Who, at Persepolis so very drunk, Did with their links the mighty ruin plan. Now, 'midst the dwelling flew the blazing stick: Soon from the flames rush'd forth the rats so thick; Men, dogs, and bats, in furious war unite— The conquer'd rats lie sprawling on the ground; The knight, with eyes triumphant, stares around, Surveys the carnage, and enjoys the sight. Not ev'n Achilles saw, so blest, his blade Dismiss whole legions to th' infernal shade! But, lo! at length by this rat-driving flame, Burnt was the corn—the walls down thund'ring came; The meaning of it was not far to learn— When turning up those billiard-balls his eyes, That held a pretty portion of surprise, ‘Zounds! what a blockhead! I have burnt the barn!’ AZID; OR, THE SONG OF THE CAPTIVE NEGRO. Poor Mora eye be wet wid tear, And heart like lead sink down wid woe; She seem her mournful friends to hear, And see der eye like fountain flow. No more she give me song so gay, But sigh, ‘Adieu, dear Domahay.’ No more for deck her head and hair, Me look in stream, bright gold to find; Nor seek de field for flow'r so fair, Wid garland Mora hair to bind. ‘Far off de stream!’ I weeping say, ‘Far off de fields of Domahay.’ But why do Azid live a slave, And see a slave his Mora dear? Come, let we seek at once de grave— No chain, to tyrant den we fear. Ah, me! I hear a spirit say, ‘Come, Azid, come to Domahay.’ Den gold I find for thee once more, For thee to fields for flow'r depart; To please de idol I adore, And give wid gold and flow'r my heart Den let we die and haste away, And live in groves of Domahay. TO CYNTHIA. Ah, what an envious rogue is Time, Who means one day to crop thy prime! This were a barb'rous deed, I vow— If thus the tyrant can behave, Lord, let us disappoint the knave, And let me take those beauties now. THE CRUELTY OF ÆNEAS TO QUEEN DIDO.I forgive man almost any crime sooner than barbarous ingratitude towards charming woman. What a brute was the pious Æneas to his mistress, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Carthage! How easily a poet of Virgil's imagination could have given a tear to the eye, and a compassionate sigh to the soul of his hero, at parting with a princess who had so hospitably entertained him, and so completely made him happy; and thus, by adding a shining, amiable, and consistent trait to his character, have rendered him an object of esteem instead of eternal condemnation! But let the base action be recorded on the pyramid of English poetry, as well as of the Roman. WHEN good Æneas left the widow Dido, Most infamous towards her was his carriage; ‘Madam,’ quoth he, ‘all men would act as I do— You will not swear I ever offer'd marriage.’ ‘'Tis very true,’ cry'd Dido, with a sigh; Then from her eyes the tears began to roll; And then she mov'd from him, resolv'd to die, And make a bonfire of herself, poor soul! What did the pious hero?—march'd on board; Fell fast asleep, and like a bull-frog snor'd. THE WORLD. This world's a charming world, I do declare— The man who understands it, I suppose, May, with a modicum of sense and care, Convert with ease each thorn into a rose. But folks become such idiots, or are born; They change life's fragrant rose into a thorn; On ev'ry smile of sunshine, fling a cloud, And then on cruel Fortune cry aloud. ON GENIUS. Dearly I like to see a genius spring, Mark his rich plumes, and eye his soaring wing; But Death too soon arrests his eagle flight! Not long upon the meteor can we gaze— From the dark element, the lightnings blaze, That breaks, and sudden shuts in pitchy night. TO A YOUNG LADY, With Collins's Poems. Amid these leaves, where Collins shines, Love boasts, alas! no golden lines; From love the bard was free: What loss! what pity, that his eye (To give his heart the sweetest sigh) Beheld no nymph like thee! SONG. [Farewel to the fragrance of morn] Farewel to the fragrance of morn; Farewel to the song of the grove— I go from my Delia forlorn; I go from the daughter of Love! I was told that I ought not to gaze On the beauty by which I'm undone; But how could I hide from their rays? What mortal can fly from the sun? FROM ANACREON. ON WOMAN. Dame NATURE, from her store, so kind, To bulls, the guarding horns assign'd, And arm'd with hoofs the bounding steed; Teeth to the lion's jaw she gave; Fins to the tenant of the wave; And cloath'd the little hare with speed. But what should Nature grant the fair? Grant!—Beauty's fascinating air: With this the charmer takes the field, And bids the world to woman yield. TO NANCY OF THE ROSE. O Nancy! wilt thou go with me, And all the poet's treasure see, My garden-house, my temple-rooms? There shall I dwell on those black eyes, And pour my tuneful soul in sighs, And catch thy panting breath's perfumes. Will Nancy quit the noisy bar, And sounds that thus with music war, Of vulgar coachman, drayman, porter; That I may press thy purple lip, And Love's delicious nectar sip, And in his prettiest language court her? Ah! Nancy, now I hear thee say, ‘Lord bless us! I'm the youthful May, And you are Autumn, sir—September; And therefore we by no means suit.’ Dear Nancy, that's the time for fruit, Thou surely oughtest to remember. Then blest together let us wing— Love only blossoms in the spring. FROM ANACREON. Haste, let the roses bind our hair, And merry jest and laugh prepare; Behold a blooming maid advance! She waves the spear, with ivy bound, And to the lute's enchanting sound, With tempting foot, begins the dance. And, breathing balmy odours, lo, A youth, whose locks luxuriant flow; The lyre he sweeps, and sweetly sings, Accordant to the tuneful strings. And see, to mingle in our joy, With golden locks, the Paphian boy; And Bacchus too, with beauteous mien; And her, of all the Loves the queen:— They come, in pleasures to engage, That gild with smiles the gloom of age. ODE. A NEW, AND MORAL, AND SERIOUS THOUGHT. How diff'rently, at diff'rent times, The self-same objects strike our senses! Thus says Sir Oracle, the man of rhimes; And thus, to prove it, he commences: Sweet are the blushes and the smiles of morn, The song of birds, and dew-bespangled thorn, To swains whose hearts are perfectly at ease: Sweet are the splendors of the golden ray, To swains prepar'd to take their early way To hill and vale, and wander where they please. But not to swains the morning smile is sweet, Dress'd out in irons—doom'd, ere noon, to greet The rope and tree, that much their spirits flurry; They see, with very, very diff'rent eyes, The sun in all his golden robes arise, And wish him not to travel in a hurry. Sweet is the parson's note to swains at church, Who, lull'd to slumber, leave him in the lurch; Whom neither manners nor religion check: Yet, ah! most terrible would be, I wot, That parson's solemn admonition note To those same swains with ropes about the neck. SONG. [When bleeding Nature droops to die] When bleeding Nature droops to die, And begs from Heav'n th' eternal sleep, Hard is the heart that cannot sigh, And curs'd the eye that scorns to weep. How rich the tear by Pity shed! How sweet her sighs for human woes! They pierce the mansions of the dead, And sooth the spectre's pale repose. SONG. [O cruel maid, adieu! adieu!] O cruel maid, adieu! adieu! Thy loss I ever shall deplore; A thousand griefs my path pursue, And joy shall gild that path no more. Lost to the world—of hope bereft— I view my fate with streaming eyes— By Love forgot, by Friendship left, By all deserted but my sighs. MODES OF COURTSHIP. O Love, thy temple is a crowded inn— And, ah! how various are thy ways to win! DEVONSHIRE-HOB'S LOVE. Joanny, my dear, wut ha poor Hob? Vor I'm upon a coortin job— Gadswunds! Iss leek thee, Joan; I'd fert vor thee—Iss, that Iss wud; Iss love thee well, as pigs love mud, Or dogs to gna a bone.

TOM AND DOLLY. A STABLE CANTATA. RECITATIVE. Amidst his straw, as Tom, a stable-swain, Did sweep and sigh, but swept and sigh'd in vain; Dolly, the cook, peep'd in upon her 'squire, And begg'd a wisp of straw to light her fire; Tom gave the wisp, and, leaning on his broom, Thus woo'd the squabby nymph of bacon-bloom. AIR. O DOLLY, not a horse nor nag, Of which my stable loud may brag, Can boast a head like thine; Nor has a saddle got a skin So sleek as thy sweet cheek and chin, Or doth so nobly shine. But thou art off, 'tis plainly seen— Yes, Dolly, I have lost the rein, Thou mischievous contriver: To gall, alack! my panting heart, I'm sure thou art resolv'd to part, And marry Dick the driver. Well, Doll, I cannot bear it long; Love sticks into me like a prong, And sets my sides a bleeding: I tell thee, Dolly, without fibs, Thou hast so curricomb'd my ribs, That I am off my feeding. Queen of the dripping-pan, O say, How canst thou hear thy Thomas bray, Nor one kind answer utter? How canst thou see thy stable-'squire Roast at thine eyes, like beef at fire, Nor melt away like butter? But thou art grown so proud of late; Thou cutt'st upon me like a plate; As short too as a crust; And then, with such a scornful eye, Thy shoulders rais'd by pride so high, All like a turkey truss'd. Sue, drive the driving-dog away; Give my starv'd love a lock of hay, For I'm in woful danger; But if thou wilt not with me dwell, Horses, and saddles, all farewel, Brooms, hay-loft, bin, and manger! RECITATIVE. Tom having finish'd in a dismal tone, Wip'd his two dropping eyes, and gave a groan; Then, sighing, said it was a cruel thing, Thus like a dishclout his poor heart to wring. The nymph, as careless of the hole (how shocking!) In Tom's poor bleeding heart as in her stocking, Low curtsying to her solemn, sighing swain, Return'd, with equal sweetness fraught, the strain. AIR. Dear Thomas, I pity thy love; But, Thomas, thou wilt not expire: Like a ladle of dripping 'twill prove, That I frequently fling on the fire. It makes a most wonderful blaze, And frightens the chimney, no doubt; Sets the family all in amaze; But, Thomas, it quickly goes out. Before we were married a year, Mighty Love, he would lose all his forces; And the musical tongue of thy dear, Would yield to the neigh of thy horses. I believe that thou thinkest sincere, This sweet passion would last all thy life; But too many can tell, with a tear, They have thought the same thing of a wife. Too often we find, to our cost, That the passions are easily cloy'd; That the object which pleases us most, Is the object that ne'er was enjoy'd. Love-matches may do very well, In worlds where folks never want meat: But in this, 'tis with sorrow I tell, We are looking for somewhat to eat. Dear Thomas, then let me alone To my roasting, and boiling, and carving; I don't like to live on a bone— Lord! nothing's more dismal than starving. To thy stable then stick all thy life; That will bring thee thy meat ev'ry day: A houseful of brats, and a wife! What would they?—why take it away. SONG. [O Nymph! of Fortune's smiles, beware] O Nymph! of Fortune's smiles, beware, Nor heed the Syren's flatt'ring tongue; She lures thee to the haunts of Care, Where Sorrow pours a ceaseless song. Ah! what are all her piles of gold? Can those the hosts of Care control? The splendor which thine eyes behold, Is not the sunshine of the soul. To Love alone thy homage pay, The queen of ev'ry true delight: Her smiles with joy shall gild thy day, And bless the visions of the night. SEA COURTSHIP. SUSAN. Madam! madam! I have just received a poetical billet-doux from my furious sea-caliban; impudence and humility, resolution and weakness, hope and despair, forming the sum total. Permit me to read it. HAWSER TO SUSAN. Miss Susan, I think it in vain To groan any more for that face; Your behaviour hath prov'd it so plain, That to others I give up the chase. Very wisely resolved, Mr. Lieutenant. About love I shall make no more pother— You know that I'm not very rich; Yet I'd man you as well as another, And stick to your timbers like pitch. Nice sticking-plaister indeed! I am out in my reck'ning, 'tis clear, As your frowns and your cruelties prove— Since I thought to have anchor'd, my dear, In your arms, that sweet harbour of love. Very elegant, tender, and metaphorical! And though you so scornful are grown, Let justice be done, by the Lord! You're a smart little frigate, I own, As a seaman would wish for to board. Thank ye, Mr. Lieutenant (curtsies). Yet, Susan, before we depart, And I beg thou'lt not take it unkind, Since your sneers have restor'd me my heart, If I give thee a piece of my mind. By all means, Mr. Hawser. Instead of my tears and my sighs, Which you, laughing, call'd Love's water-gruel, Could guineas have rain'd from my eyes, By G? thou hadst never been cruel. Impudent rogue! And yet, should the wind chop about, And thy mouth cease this d?mn'd squally weather, Let us send for old Thump-cushion The priest. out, And swing in a hammock together. Never, never, indeed, poor swain. DAPHNE, OR THE SONG OF THE SHEPHERDESS. Farewel the beam of early day! Cold on the eye the valley fades; The riv'let mourns upon its way, And spectres seem to haunt the shades. These eyes, alas! no pleasure see, Since Colin's love is chang'd from me. Adieu the crook he gave my hand! Adieu the flow'rs that deck my hair! Go doves, and leave your silken band, Since Daphne is no longer fair. These eyes, &amp;c. Let nought by Daphne be possest— The myrtle-wreath that binds my brow; The knot of love he gave my breast, Deep blushing for his broken vow. These eyes, &amp;c. Let all his tokens meet his eye— From Daphne all his gifts depart; And let me send with these a sigh, To tell him of a broken heart. These eyes, &amp;c. MADRIGAL. [Ah! say not that the bard grows old—] Ah! say not that the bard grows old— For what to me are passing years? I feel not Age's palsied cold— To-day like yesterday appears. When beauty beams, the world is gay! What mortal is not then alive? Thus kindling at its magic ray, Fourscore leaps back to twenty-five. ODE TO TWO MICE IN A TRAP. So, sir, and madam, you at length are taken, After your dances over cheese and bacon, And tasting ev'ry dainty in your way; Now to my question, answer, if ye please— Speak, did ye make the bacon or the cheese? What sort of a defence d'ye set up, pray? Thus at free cost to breakfast, dine, and sup! Ev'n mild Judge Buller ought to hang you up, So full of the sweet milk of human nature! What sort of fate, young people, should ye choose? In purling streams your pretty mouths amuse, Or feed the cat's fond jaws, that for ye water? I see you are two lovers, by your eyes; I hear ye are two lovers by your sighs: But what avail your looks, or what avail Your sighs so soft, or what indeed your tears, Or what your parting agonies and fears, Since Death must pay a visit to your jail? Ay, you may kiss and pant, and pant and kiss, And put your pretty noses through the wire; Ay, peep away, sweet sir, and gentle miss; No more the moon shall mark your am'rous fire Around the loaded pantry pour the ray, And guide your gambols with her silver day. Your prison-door now, culprits, let me ope— Now, now! you're off! it is a lucky hop. Ye're in the right on't, nimble nymph and swain; Go, rogues—but if once more I catch you here!— What then? what then!—why then, I strongly fear, Ye little robbers, you'll escape again. Thus let me imitate Judge Buller's deeds, Beneath whose sentence scarce a felon bleeds; Who, as the fur of foxes trims his gown, The hand of Mercy lines his heart with down. THE MISER AND THE DERVISE. The miser Sherdi on his sick-bed lying, Affrighted, groaning, wheezing, praying, sighing, Expecting ev'ry hour to lose his breath— Enter a dervise—‘Holy father, say, As life seems parting from this sinful clay, What can preserve me from the jaws of Death? ‘A sacrifice, dear son—good joints of meat, Of lamb, and mutton, for the priest and poor; Nay, from the Koran shouldst thou lines repeat, Those lines may possibly thy health restore.’ ‘Thank ye, dear father! you have said enough; Your counsel has already giv'n me ease: Now as my sheep are all a great way off, I'll quote our holy Koran, if you please.’ TO DELIA. Delia, thou really dost not know thy worth— Nature has made a very idle blunder, To give thee roses, lilies, and so forth, Eyes, dimples, merely to excite our wonder. See other girls, of far inferior charms! Behold them spreading through the world alarms, With not one quarter of thy ammunition; Dark'ning the dangerous air with dreadful darts; Transfixing lovers' livers, heads, and hearts, Putting the beaux into a sad condition; Whilst thou, so idle, mak'st not man thy game, As though the creature were not worth thy aim. But, Delia, come—on me thy prowess try; Let loose the lightnings of thy coal-black eye; Attack, pursue—I like the dangerous strife— Sweet nymph, 'tis ten to one thou lay'st me low; Yet do not kill me, my dear generous foe, But make me pris'ner to thy arms for life. SONG. [Where Fortune reigns in splendid pride] Where Fortune reigns in splendid pride, What madding thousands crowd her shrine! With sweet Simplicity their guide, O Love, how few resort to thine! Yet when of Fortune's smile possess'd, The sigh for other days they pour; Some secret sorrow stings the breast, And languor-loaded crawls each hour. But Love's pure joys unsullied last; His vot'ries taste a bliss sublime, Sigh to regain the moments past, And wish to clip the wings of Time. SONG. [Good Lord! when I think of the storm] SUSAN. What a pretty hurricane about our ears! Well thank Heaven, and out good old ship, for his holding his head so long above water, we are not got down into Davy Jone's locker. Good Lord! when I think of the storm, And, old Neptune, thy horrible spleen, That endeavour'd to make of this form A feast for the fish at nineteen! It had giv'n my poor heart some alarms, As well as some grief to my spark, To have found, that, instead of his arms, I had fill'd up the mouth of a shark. Dear Neptune, a sweetheart is mine— Not a handsomer England possesses: Shouldst thou bury these limbs in thy brine, They will lose a whole world of caresses. Oh, afford me one glance of my lover— Oh, grant but one kiss from my swain; Thou shalt drown me a thousand times over, If ever I trust thee again. SONG. [From me, since Hope hath wing'd her way] From me, since Hope hath wing'd her way, To yield to luckier swains delight, Ah! will not Comfort lend a ray, To gild my bosom's dreary night? Yes! yes! to sooth my burning breast, As far from Delia's form I rove, I'll boast that once this heart was blest, And tell the story of my love. TO VENUS. O Venus, wherefore is my sigh To Delia's beauty breath'd in vain? Ah! why her cold and clouded eye, That sun-like shone upon her swain? A time there was, when thou wert kind, And gav'st success to ev'ry pray'r; When ev'ry sigh was sure to find A sigh congenial from the fair. A time there was, when Delia's breast, At all my griefs, with grief would glow; The nymph would lull the storm to rest, And sooth with ev'ry charm my woe. Yet, Venus, wheresoe'er she flies, To Delia all thy blisses give: In me, a single shepherd dies, In her, behold, a thousand live! EPITAPH. [O thou, remov'd from this world's strife] O thou, remov'd from this world's strife, Whose relics here below are laid, May Peace, who watch'd thy harmless life, In death protect thy gentle shade! Yet not alone around thy bier, Thy children's sighs unfeign'd ascend; The mourner Pity drops a tear, And Virtue weeps a vanish'd friend. ODE TO A COUNTRY HOYDEN. Dear Dolly, stay thy scampering joints one minute, And let me ask thee, mad-cap girl, a question— Somewhat of consequence there may be in it, That, probably, mayn't suit thy high digestion. Pray what's the meaning of the present glee? To ride a nannygoat, or ass, or pig? Or mount an ox, or ride an apple-tree, And on the dancing limb enjoy a jig? Perhaps thou art infected with an itch To plague a poor old crone, baptiz'd a witch; To smoke her in her hovel—kill her cats, Or lock her in, and rob her garden's peas, Kick down the lame old granny's hive of bees, And break her windows in, with stones and bats. Perchance to rob an orchard thou may'st long, Or neighbour's hen's-nest of its eggs, or young; Nay, steal the mother-hen to boot: Perchance thou hasten'st, fond of vulgar joys, To tumble on the hay-cocks with the boys, And let them take, at will, the sweet salute. Thou makest a long face, and answer'st thus— ‘Lord, then about a trifle what a fuss! As though a body might not ride a pig, Or nannygoat, indeed, or ox, good me! Or our old Neddy A name frequently given to a Jack-ass., or an apple tree, Just for one's health to have a little jig! ‘Or where's the mighty harm, upon my word, In taking a few eggs, or chicks, or hen? The farmers can't be ruin'd by't, good Lord! Papa says that they're all substantial men. ‘Or where's the harm to ride upon a gate? To snub one so, indeed, at such a rate! I've tumbled from the trees upon the stones, And never broke, in all my life, my bones: See, sir, I have not one black spot about me! 'Tis cruel, then, for nothing thus to flout me. ‘Or where's the mighty crime, I wonder, pray, With cousin Dick to tumble on the hay? Just like a baby with her doll you treat one! Marry come up! why, cousin Dick won't eat one! And then, forsooth, what mighty harm would come, In having bits of fun with cousin Tom?’ Dolly, thy artless answers force my smile— I readily believe thee void of guile; My lovely girl, I think thou mean'st no harm: But had I daughters just like thee, let loose, I verily should think myself a goose, To mark each colt-like lass without alarm. Doll, get thee home, and tell mamma, so mild, So fearful that a frown would kill her child, That not ev'n birch to kill that child is able; And tell thy father, a fond fool, from me, To look a little sharper after thee, Clip thy wild tongue, and tie thee to the table. THE GRAVE OF EURIPIDES. AN ELEGY. Supposed to be spoken on the Spot. O thou, whose deeply-pictur'd scenes of woe From Grecian eyes could force the pitying show'r! Permit a stranger's sigh unfeign'd to flow— Indulge his hand to strew the sweetest flow'r. I know I shall not by thy shade be scorn'd, Who boast my birth from Albion's free domain; Where Nature's soul, like thine, in Shakespeare mourn'd, Where Milton's genius pour'd th' immortal strain. Yet lo, a race of this degenerate age, Sons of those sages, heroes, bards, whose name Gave splendor to the fair historic page, Forgets the glory of the Grecian name. I mark you, son of Athens, with a sigh! Of Pow'r, of Ignorance, the abject slave The present inhabitants of Greece fully answer this description.— Fear on his cheek, and mis'ry in his eye, He wanders near thee, heedless of thy grave! Where is thy fame? In Greece no more divine, It pours on Albion's isle the radiant day; There, with a noon-tide lustre may it shine, And gild my country with unclouded ray! Each night retiring, as I whisper peace, With each adieu, the tear will steal away; To think that thou the song of gods shouldst cease, And, dying, mingle with the meanest clay. Though Greece forgets thee, yet on Fancy's wing From distant Albion will I oft return; Crown thy cold sod with all the blooms of spring, And envy the rich earth that holds thy urn. SONG TO CYNTHIA. The youth by Love and Hope betray'd, Who breathes his ardent vows in vain, Learns to forget the scornful maid, And bravely breaks her galling chain. ‘Farewell (he cries) a fruitless flame; A nymph less cruel let me find; The world holds many a blooming dame; An equal Chloe may be kind.’ But, ah! how hard the lover's fate, Who feels the triumph of thine eye! What virgin shall his fires abate, And sooth his bosom's hopeless sigh? For, lo! the Loves, to make thee fair, Agreed with ev'ry charm to part; And all the Virtues too declare, They robb'd their own, to grace thy heart. HYMN TO LOVE. Soul of the world, and essence of delight, Of thee I think by day, and dream by night, For I'm a bachelor—a good old maid! Yet now, O Love, a pretty woman's smiles Could make me dance at least a dozen miles, Without a stick indeed, or horse's aid. Such rapture from thy bloom, each moment feels! Such mercury thou puttest in one's heels! Did Jove prize charming woman, just like me, Of charming woman we should find a dearth; In beauty, what a desert there would be! Scarce one sweet female to delight our earth. And then, O Cynthia, whom these eyes adore; Whose form, and face, and mind, no rival know; Yes, thou fair maid, to that untravell'd shore, To charm the Thunderer, wouldst be doom'd to go; And leave, alas! thy sighing shepherd here, Who never wants a muse when thou art near. And now to thee, O Love, again I turn— How canst thou hear an earthly angel mourn? A victim to the vultures of Despair! A witless victim to the villain's snare! How see, vile man her virtue undermine, And bid the fairest form of Nature pine? Why sufferest thou her bosom's softest sigh? How canst thou, unreveng'd, survey the maid; Hear her soul's grief, behold her beauty fade; Nay, horror! the poor lamb-like victim die? Lo, poor deserted Julia! once how fair; With cheek so wan and pale, and scatter'd hair; Her gentle heart by Love's mad tempest torn! She runs, she stops, and wildly stares around! Now nails the eye of thought into the ground! Now drown'd in tears, she lifts its beam forlorn; Pale as the moon, amidst the midnight storm! When rains and driving clouds her face deform! She grasps the earth—the sod, her fingers tear— Now wearied, disappointed, to the skies She lifts her lids of woe, and plaintive sighs, (Soul-piercing sound!) ‘Alas, he is not here!’ Rich pearls of sorrow from their fountains stray, And drop (too precious for the ground!) away. ‘How could he, cruel, give my heart a blow?’ She moans—now sits upon the bank and sings; Oft breaks her dirge with lengthen'd sighs of woe, And, pausing, mutters incoherent things. Now plucking lilies from the sod, she cries, ‘Sweet flow'rs, I once was innocent like you; The tear, alas! a stranger to these eyes— Nor blush my cheek, nor wound my bosom knew.’ Now with a smile, and now with melting wail, She whisp'ring tells of Colin's love the tale. Again her mind is on the wing! she starts! Hope to her eyes her eagle-beam imparts! Sudden she springs from earth—‘He's there—he's there— I see him pass the flood—dear Colin, dear! Thy Julia calls thee—'tis thy Julia, stay— Thy Julia calls thee—wherefore haste away? Thy Julia loves thee—do not, cruel, fly; Stay, or thy Julia's heart with grief will die— If danger urge, that danger let me share; Thou must not live unwatch'd by Julia's care.’ Sweet wretch! in vain her feet the phantom chase! Wildly she plunges 'mid the torrent's roar— She shrieks! her arms her fancied love embrace, She grasps the gulf—ah! soon to grasp no more. Lost maid! in vain the shepherds try to save! Breath'd is her spirit in the whelming wave! No longer doom'd Life's bitter cup to taste, Behold her hours of woe for ever past! Deaf to the song of Flatt'ry, now, her ear! Deaf to a demon's whispers once so dear! Cold too the bosom of the once warm maid! The heart that swell'd with Love's delicious sighs, Still in its silent cell of darkness lies, And dim her eyes in Death's eternal shade. Those orbs that sparkling bade a world adore, Ah, doom'd to sparkle, and to stream no more! Lo, on the bank her pale limbs stretch'd along, Amidst the sorrows of a rural throng! A sight to strike the voice of Rapture mute, And wake the tenderest string of Pity's lute! Thee, thee, her murd'rer, Vengeance soon shall find, Sure blood-hound, trace thee in the weeping wind; Pursue thee where the desert grins with death: For not to man again shalt thou return— A shrinking world thy Cain-like form shall spurn, And, kneeling, curse thee with its keenest breath. Smote and unburied shall thy carcase lie; Afar, affrighted shall the vultures fly; Of fiends like thee, a breathless fiend, afraid; And lo, the frowning Genius of the gloom Shall shun the solitude that hails thy doom, And bid each savage seek a distant shade. ODE. ['Tis a strange world we live in—but 'twill mend—] 'Tis a strange world we live in—but 'twill mend— As ev'ry body says, ‘the world grows wiser;’ Yet certain follies ne'er will have an end, Of which I am a wonderful despiser. Is it not cruel, when, with all his flame, Genius performs a work, a man should bawl, ‘To ask much for this trifle were a shame; I know the fellow took no pains at all. ‘Poets work nimbly, nimbly, now-a-days: Give a good penny's-worth, good Master Bays.’ I dare say the sad bookseller, a L?e, Or L??k?n, pour'd such unhallow'd sounds On Milton's shrinking ear, with lips profane, Who bought th' immortal work for fifteen pounds The price actually given for the Paradise Lost!!’ Too many a ragged brother of the lay, Too many a fair historian, never doubt it, Have heard a bookseller so cruel say, ‘Pray, Sir, or ‘Ma'am how long were you about it?’ Thou beast! amid the sons of Wisdom plac'd, Who, times of old, as well as modern, grac'd, Couldst thou not catch a portion of their fire! Rolls not thine eye upon their works each day? And canst thou, from them, nothing bear away, To lift thy hog-like soul above the mire? Sore troubled by the tooth-ache, Lubin ran, To get the murd'rer of his quiet drawn; An artist in an instant whips its out— ‘Well, Master Snag—hæ? what has I to pay?’ ‘A shilling’—‘Zounds! a shilling do ye zay?’ With a long staring face replies the lout. ‘Lord! why Ize did not veel it—'twas nort in it; You knows ye wern't about it half a minute: To gee zo much Ize cursedly unwilling— Lord! vor a tooth but yesterday old Slop Did drag me by the head about his shop Three times, poor man, and only ax'd a shilling.’ SONG. [How chang'd is my Celadon's heart!] How chang'd is my Celadon's heart! How alter'd each look of the swain! Now sullen he wishes to part, Who call'd me the pride of the plain. Of late, with what ardour he strove Ev'ry hour that was mine to beguile! How he griev'd if I doubted his love! And how blest if he gain'd but a smile! To me he devoted his days; And raptur'd on me was his tongue; Thus, Morning arose on his praise, And Evening went down on his song. Let me steal to the desert, and die, Nor wound with reproaches his ears; My reproof shall be only a sigh— My complaint, but the silence of tears. EPIGRAM. See Clodio, happy in his own dear sense! And hark; the world cries ‘Coxcomb in th' excess;’ Now let me undertake the fop's defence— What man could ever be content with less? ANACREONTIC. TO SYLVIA. How canst thou smile at my despair, And bid me other nymphs adore? Show me a girl but half so fair, And I will trouble thee no more. Hide then that neck, and lip, and eye, Since thus resolv'd to shun pursuit; For Love will follow, like the fly, That always seeks the fairest fruit. LISETTA. In the name of the great god of love, how shall I dispose of myself? Which of my swains must wear the willow? O Virgins, tell me how to choose, For I'm a novice on it— Poor Colin at a distance wooes, And sends his soul in sonnet; While Lubin, to no forms a slave, Won't stay to write for blisses; But prints upon my mouth, the knave, His wishes with his kisses. If Lubin seize a rude embrace, And I begin to clatter; The rogue stares gravely in my face, And asks me what's the matter? Of kisses lately he stole three— I shriek'd with might and main: ‘Since ye don't like them,’ pert quoth he, ‘Lord! take them back again.’ ‘No, no, I won't,’ says I, keep off, They please me much,’ I swore— ‘Oh, is it so cried he, ‘enough; Then, Miss, you wish for more.’ Poor Colin turns, if I but frown, All white as any fleece is! Lubin would give me a green gown, And rummage me to pieces. The one, so meek and complaisant, All silence, awe, and wonder; The other, impudence and rant, And boist'rous as the thunder. This begs to press my finger's tip, So bashful is my lover; That savage bounces on my lip, And kisses it all over. O Modesty thou art so sweet! Not wild, and bold, and teasing; And yet, each sister nymph I meet Thinks boldness not unpleasing. This is a wicked world!—O dear! And wickedness is in me— Though Modesty's so sweet, I fear That Impudence will win me. CORIN'S PROFESSION, OR THE SONG OF CONSTANCY. Now, Joan, we are married—and now, let me say, Tho' both are in youth, yet that youth will decay, In our journey thro' life, my dear Joan, I suppose We shall oft meet a bramble, and sometimes a rose. When a cloud on this forehead shall darken my day, Thy sunshine of sweetness must smile it away; And when the dull vapour shall dwell upon thine. To chase it, the labour and triumph be mine. Let us wish not for wealth, to devour and consume; For luxury's but a short road to the tomb: Let us sigh not for grandeur, for trust me, my Joan, The keenest of cares owes its birth to a throne. Thou shalt milk our one cow; and if Fortune pursue, In good time; with her blessing, my Joan may milk two: I will till our small field, whilst thy prattle and song Shall charm as I drive the bright ploughshare along. When finish'd the day, by the fire we'll regale, And treat a good neighbour at eve with our ale; For Joan, who would wish for self only to live? One blessing of life, my dear girl, is to give. Ev'n the red-breast and wren shall not seek us in vain, Whilst thou hast a crumb, or thy Corin a grain; Not only their songs will they pour from the grove, But yield, by example, sweet lessons of love. Though thy beauty must fade, yet thy youth I'll remember; That thy May was my own, when thou showest December; And when age to my head shall his winter impart, The summer of love shall reside in my heart. ODE TO UGLINESS. Daughter of Hecate, thou'rt undone! Joy to my soul, thine empire falls: No more, thou hobbling, envious crone Thy pow'r the female world appalls. With smiles the queen of love appears, No longer trembling for the Graces: No more thy rude attack she fears, On faultless forms, and fairest faces. Beauty will never lose her prime, Nor mourn her losses, as of yore! Defeated too thy brother Time, The god of wrinkle, wounds no more. See Age display her iv'ry rows! Her lip preserves its purple bloom! Her bosom heaves with Alpine snows, And kisses breathe the rich perfume! The furrow'd cheek, and hoary head, No longer now, as usual, greet; And, what our grandmothers all dread, The nose and chin no longer meet. Time's pow'r the good old grannies brave. And, ogling, dart their am'rous fire; Decline with graces to the grave, And with the blush of health expire! THE TRAVELLER AND JUPITER. What wicked thousands sooner would affront (Such is of sin the wonderful increase) The Heav'n's Eternal Ruler—fie upon't— Than one poor brainless justice of the peace, Or country 'squire, who nothing knows but doxies, Hares, acts of parliament, hounds, horses, foxes? Nay, further—which should scarcely be repeated— (And, oh! that groundless were the poet's fears!) God by his own sad servants is worse treated, Worse than our country gentlemen by theirs. Ask of the bishops else, whose humble souls Sweet Mercy melts, and Charity controls. To cheat the Dev'l, at times, I've no objection; Not Heav'n! 'tis such a villanous reflection! A certain traveller, in ancient days, When gods and goddesses were thick as hops, Wishing, as he was beating the highways, For somewhat dainty to amuse his chops; Knelt down to Jupiter, and thus began: ‘O Jupiter, as I'm an honest man, I'll keep my word, if thou wilt grant my pray'r; Amidst my travels, let me something find— Little or much, good, bad of any kind, I vow to thee, thy godship half shall share.’ Then with grave sanctity he thump'd his craw; Much as to say, ‘Great Jove, my word's a law.’ He had not walk'd a mile, before he found A handsome bag of filberts on the ground; At sight of which, his lips with rapture smacking, Plump down he squats, and falls at once to cracking. To cut my story short, he crack'd and eat, From ev'ry nut, each atom of the meat; When gravely gathering up the shells, he cries, ‘Jove, sacred have I kept my word—for, see, The better half indeed I leave to thee, The shells, O mighty ruler of the skies. ‘There are they all, great Jove—survey 'em: Shouldst thou suspect my honour—weigh 'em!’ SONG. [The wretch, O let me never know] The wretch, O let me never know, Who turns from Pity's tearful eye; Who melts not at the dirge of woe, But bids the soul renew its sigh! O say not with the voice of scorn, ‘The lilies of thy neck are fled, Thine eyes their vanish'd radiance mourn, The roses of thy cheek are dead.’ Too cruel youth, with tears I own, The rose and lily's sad decay; And sorrowing wish for thee alone, Their transient bloom a longer day. Yet though thine eyes no longer trace The healthful blush of former charms; Remember that each luckless grace, O Colin, faded in thy arms! ODE TO MY GOOD FRIEND THE MOST MERCIFUL JUDGE ?. O ?, whose fair heart so full of love, Melts, snow-like, on the victim void of hope; Whose conscience stretches like the softest glove, To save the sighing culprit from the rope! To thee, in Virtue's stoutest armour, strong, Permit thy friend and bard to pour the song. O let us drag the foes of man to day, And hang them like thy rats Hereby hangs a pretty little tale. upon our lay, Murd'rers that strike the cheek of Horror pale! Whose morals give contagion to a jail. Illumin'd, ah! too oft by Fortune's rays, A pigmy wretch is shown in yon huge house Westminster Hall.; Just as the solar microscope displays A mite, a flea, a bug, a dirty louse. A judge may rise, despising Nature's groan; A villain, in damnation sunk so deep; That Vice, black Vice, shall ne'er be idle known, But when the fur-clad monster falls asleep! Just as the hackney-coachmen curse aloud Kind Sol, who dissipates a threatening cloud, Dark-hov'ring, wishing much his power to show, And bid his deluge drown the world below; Just as the restless demon of the night Low'rs on the maiden blush of orient light, And skulks into the charnel's murky shade; A judge may rise, whose scowl shall curse the smile Of Justice, who so long has blest our isle, And strike with ruffian fist the heav'nly maid. Where is the judge, in murder only brave, Whose soul delights to feed the gaping grave; Who on the convict's pale cheek feasts his eyes; Whose heart-felt sounds are Hope's expiring sighs. Where is the happy patron of the rope, Whose eyes on seas of blood would gladly ope; Fresh hecatombs of carnage, ev'ry morn: Whose ear could live on Virtue's deepest groan; Stretch ev'n to pain, to catch her last faint moan, Poor writhing wretch, by ev'ry torture torn? There's no such damned judge—but let me say, So foul a spirit may disgrace the day. Where is the judge, who 'midst his shrinking vale, Walks forth, ah! not to hear the turtle's tale; But with a happy, keen, and sparkling eye, To see the kite with fury sweep the sky; Now in his iron talons bear along, The lark which charm'd the season with his song? To such Dame Nature never yet gave birth— But such a miscreant vile, may curse the earth. Where is the judge, who courts the gloom of night; Charm'd with the owl's and bat's and beetle's flight, And sees with joy the spectred band pass by; With rapture listens to their piteous wail, Now follows hard to catch the mournful tale, And sorrows when the phantoms 'scape his eye? A judge, like this, to bid poor Nature mourn, Was never yet, thank Heav'n! but may be born. Where is the judge who walks the foaming shore At midnight, 'midst the ruthless tempest's roar, When Fate and Horror ride the thund'ring deep; Who, for the cormorant's broad pinion sighs, To mingle with the tumult of the skies, And join the whirlwind's wild resistless sweep; To hover o'er the darken'd scene of death, And triumph in the seaman's shrieking breath; Charm'd with each mountain surge, for life that raves; Charm'd as the arm of Fate, with cruel shock, Heaves the huge vessel on the groaning rock, And rends it piece-meal, 'midst a world of waves? ‘There's no such man, nor ever was,’ you cry: Sweet judge, dear dove-like—! so say I. But may there not a dev'l like this appear? Life deals in monsters much too oft, I fear! O Devon, parent of immortal men, O should thy beauteous bosom prove a den, To hold and suckle such an imp of shame; Know, to the poet though thou gavest birth, With soul-felt ardour will I wish thy death, Renounce thy blasted soil, and change my name. SONG. [Fie, fie, thou charming infidel!—listen.] SYLVIA. Dashwood, I dislike your jokes on matrimony: you possess too much sense to treat with so much levity a state which the first philosophers hold sacred. But your jest must not be spared, though ruin be the consequence. After all your pretty professions, I am not now certain that your passion is sincere—how am I to be convinced? DASHWOOD. Fie, fie, thou charming infidel!—listen. DEAR girl, I'm up to ears in love! The fact, a thousand follies prove; Yes, yes, I feel the dart! Well! now I'm wounded, give the cure; Thou'rt not a cruel girl, I'm sure, So try to ease the smart. ‘Lord bless us! it is all a lie,’ I hear thee with emotion cry, ‘I'm sure there's nothing in't:’ ‘Indeed there is, I'm sore afraid, Nay, take the symptoms, sceptic maid, That make it plain as print.’ The instant that I see thee coming, My heart against my ribs keeps drumming, As if to caper out; To make his congé at thy feet, Pronounce himself thy slave so sweet, And fight for thee, so stout. From those dear lips, delicious bliss, If saucy coxcombs steal a kiss, My eyes so jealous roll: Aside, I call the puppies names, My heart is Ætna-like in flames, Consuming to a coal. I cannot bear to be alone; I yawn, I sigh, I gape, I groan, And writhe as if with pain: Now on a sudden seize a book, Just half a minute in it look, Then fling it down again. Now ruminating wild, I walk, Nod to myself, and smile, and talk; Now hunt for something lost; Now sit, jump up—now stare, now wink, On some deep problem, seem to think— Now vacant as a post. Now seize the violin, and scratch A half a glee, or half a catch; Now snatch the brush, and paint; Now fling it down, and seize the flute, Now hum an air divine, now hoot, To make poor Music faint. Now full resolv'd to visit thee, And take a social cup of tea, And give my heart a plaster; I draw my watch, not over cool, Call him a little limping fool, And bid him travel faster. Now bustling round the room, here, there, I try to find my hat, and swear, And wish him damn'd, and dead; Now raging from my inmost soul, I roar, ‘What thief my hat hath stole?’ Then find it on my head. Nay, nay, I'd marry thee, my dear— Love's symptoms now too plain appear; There's nobody can miss it: Yet if these symptoms are not love, And this the passion fail to prove, Why, what the devil is it? O that I did not love thee, girl, And that my head, in this wild whirl, Could keep a little steady! But 'tis in vain, alas! to preach; Like drowning boys, I've lost my reach; My sense is gone already. Yet, Sylvia, know the single elf Has only one to serve—viz. self; But when he takes a wife, A hundred masters then appear; And what is very hard, my dear, His slavery lasts for life. HYMN TO ADVERSITY. Thus sung the bard of old, and deem'd no fool, ‘Sweet are the uses of adversity;’ A dame who kicketh from your rump your stool, And, savage, showeth not one grain of mercy t'ye; Bids all your fancied-dearest friends turn tail; Greets with wir'd whips, and blesses with a jail. O mistress of this wisdom-teaching pain, With Pill'ry, Gibbet, Famine, in thy train, Go knock, God bless thee, knock at others' doors: By all my fav'rite gods of prose and rhime, I feel not thy philosophy sublime— Go, seek the zealot who thy stripes implores. Go, thunder on another's house thy strife; Snatch from a husband's happy arms a wife; Blot from his soul each glimm'ring ray of hope; Rack all his lovely daughters with disease; Poison his sons, and, more thy rage to please, Present the fainting father with a rope. But let me keep wife, children, peace, and land, And learn thy lessons all at second hand. My taste is dull—yes, vastly dull indeed! I hate to see a brother mortal bleed— I hate to hear a gentle nature groan, And, goddess, more especially my own. Yes, yes, Heav'n knows, my taste is more confin'd; Prefers the zephyr to the howling wind; Prefers too, such my star's unlucky blunder, One hour's bright calm, to months of cloud and thunder. Thou possibly may'st be a good physician, But certés dost not know my weak condition. Blisters, and scarifying, and spare diet, Would set my nervous system in a riot; Rich cordial drafts would answer best, I trow, Made up by Messieurs Hammersly and Co. Thine iron scourge would really act in vain, So apt am I to make wry mouths at pain; At disappointment much inclin'd to moan. Whenever then, O goddess, things we see, That with one's nature so much disagree, Methinks 'twere better they were let alone. To tumble from a house, or from a tow'r, And break a luckless brace of legs and arms, Would make one look most miserably sour; Yet are there men, who deem all these no harms. Then seek them, goddess—souse them on the stones, And for their goodly comfort, crack their bones. If in a well-stuff'd coach, well-overset, A broken leg and thigh and arm I get, I am not, I confess, of that pure leaven, To crawl out on my hands and knees, and say, Grace-like, ‘For what I have receiv'd this day, I humbly thank thee, O most gracious Heav'n.’ O mistress of the terrifying mien, The boatswain's deep-ton'd voice and brawny arm, O be not within leagues of Peter seen; Thy cat-o'-nine tails cannot, cannot charm. A stupid scholar, goddess, I shall be; Thy conversations are too deep for me. Yes, madam, you are too sublime a dame For Peter's company, I speak with shame— A little winning wench contenteth me, 'Clep'd Fortune, a good-natur'd smiling lass, Who constant lights my pipe, and fills my glass, And makes my ev'ry day a jubilee. This is the sweet companion for my money; Such is the little Syren I desire— Thou art all gall, and she all milk and honey; 'Tis at a distance I must thee admire. A hawk-like appetite, and empty platters, The bleak wind whistling through a coat in tatters, The flight of fancied friends, a foe's abuses, Are things for which my bowels do not yearn; For rot me, madam, if I can discern One atom of their several earthly uses. Morality may wear a ruffle shirt, I really think, and not his conscience hurt— Morality may also like nice picking; For since the great All-wise has giv'n us fowls, Mankind were certainly a set of owls, To dare to place damnation in a chicken. Morality, I ween, may go well drest; Keep a good fire, and live upon the best; Throw by his wheel-barrow, and keep a carriage; Visit the op'ra, masquerade, and play; Drink claret, Burgundy, Champagne, Tokay; Get fifty thousand with a girl in marriage. To eat from splendid plate, or homely manger, Methinks the soul is just in equal danger. Besides, 'tis late, O goddess, in the day— I'm not a subject fit for thee to flay; To speak the truth, my nerves too nicely feel— Go, search the motley mixture of mankind; Some young enthusiast wild, thou soon mayst find, Proud of thy whips, and glad to grace thy wheel. So great for my own person is my love, And hard thy lessons, I can't now begin 'em— Besides, as I have hinted just above, I'd rather read of battles than be in 'em. SONG TO SAPPHO. At length, O fairest nymph, farewell, Let sighs alone my passion tell; With tears I quit thy arms: Adieu each eve of pure delight; Adieu each morn with rapture bright; Adieu thy brighter charms! Where'er by Fate condemn'd to stray, Where Phœbus pours the golden day, Or sleeps beneath the wave, Thine image will my path pursue, And ever present on my view, Detain me still a slave. In vain I roam—I strive in vain To break, O beauteous maid, thy chain! Yet why my fetters part? Ev'n now thy sighs, my sighs approve; Ev'n now thy love, returns my love, And yields me heart for heart! INVOCATION TO ST. CECILIA. ON A LADY SINGING. Descend, O Goddess, from thy sphere, And listen to a British maid; A sweeter Sappho warbles here, Than charm'd of yore the Lesbian shade. Yet not like Sappho's mourns her strain, Alas! with Love's desponding sigh; To Delia's beauty bows each swain, And owns the triumph of her eye. ON THE DEATH OF A MUSICAL FRIEND. A PASTORAL ELEGY. How blest were the nymphs and the swains, When Lycidas join'd in the song; The chief, and the pride of the plains, Who led all the Pleasures along! Of late not a valley was fair, Not a grove gave a musical sound; The breeze seem'd a sigh of despair, And Pity sat mute on the ground. But Nature (how sudden the change!) At the presence of Lycidas smil'd— Health was seen through the valley to range, And an Eden sprung up from the wild! The throstle was heard in the shade; The linnet enliven'd the grove, And Echo, long banish'd, sweet maid, Return'd with her stories of love. Yes, each scene at his presence was glad, That so lately with sorrow was rent; And the voice of the mourner so sad, Was lost in the songs of Content. Just able to crawl o'er the stile, And doom'd, ah! to labour no more, Age would crawl from his cot with a smile, And a blessing to leave at his door. But the shepherd for ever is gone— Hark! his knell, how it saddens the gale! Joy dies, and our pastimes are flown; Fate envies the smiles of our vale. Now let Mirth from each hamlet retire To the region of silence and gloom: Sure his death must our sorrow inspire, Since the Virtues will weep at his tomb. APOLLO TO THE ANACREONTIC SOCIETY, AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR. Ye sons of Anacreon, listen awhile; 'Tis Apollo, your friend, that sends greeting— Of your pleasures, we gods are in love with the style, And are mad to be down at your meeting. Father Jove with your sounds is so wondrously pleas'd, That he swears at our flats and our sharps; With the squalls of each muse he'll no longer be teas'd, So commands me to break up their harps. He has quite put a stop to poor Momus's fun, And forbid his jeux d'esprit to flow; Thus our club is knock'd up, because we're outdone By the mirth of you mortals below. Then accept my petition—a wish most sincere; Let me join as the laureate your throng; Though I cannot, like Incledon, ravish your ear, I can give you a pretty good song. As for example: SONG BY APOLLO. A p?x on all sorrow—on happiness seize— Care, avaunt! nor our pleasures alloy; Since Jove has giv'n passions and objects to please, The meaning is, mortals enjoy. Jove's a god of ten thousand—the monarch, I know, Loves his bottle, girl, song, and a jest; Has a monstrous regard for choice spirits below, And is charm'd when his creatures are blest. But he's vex'd when a fool takes it into his head, That he's lost, if he meddles with pleasure; And thinks, too, the fellow confounded ill-bred, To refuse when he offers the treasure. When a zealot has turn'd up the whites of his eyes, With long phiz, and a puritan strain, I have seen the god laugh, and in fun, from the skies, Make up mouths at the blockhead again. Then push round the bottle—let each give his song; Wit, humour, and friendship attend us; And whilst for enjoyment our passions are strong, Let us ask not his godship to mend us. Thus we'll revel, till morning peeps into our glass Then to scenes of new rapture remove; To embrace with devotion a wife or a lass, And be blest on the bosom of love. ODE TO A HANDSOME WIDOW. See yonder cloud, that mopes with mournful shade, Black! black, as tho' it never would be bright! Sol, like a bridegroom comes, a jovial blade, Clasps her with warmth, and lo, her darkness, light! The dress of Cloud soon alters! for, behold, Her gloomy sables change to pink and gold! Daughter of sorrow, thus perchaunce 'twill be, If I mistake not Nature, soon with thee. Pale as the pale rain-loaded lily's look, And languid as the willow o'er the brook, Exalt once more that drooping form to joy; Too long the lute of Woe, with dying sound, And melting lullaby thine eye hath drown'd; The trump of Rapture should his voice employ; The sprightly Fiddle rouse his sister Dance, And bid thy cold heart glow with Love's romance. Thy lifted eyes too eloquently mourn, Deep-swimming in the silent fount of tears; And then thy voice so musically lorn, Accusing Fate's too cruel, cruel shears, Wakes all the soft emotions of my heart, That sympathising fain would mirth impart. But grief for spouses lasts not ladies long; Yet very poignant!—yes, though short, 'tis strong, When first the best of husbands breathes his last: And if his all be left them!—what a storm Of sighs and tears their beauty to deform! Grief seems as ever he would ride the blast. Yet soon, 'tis said, the winds of Woe are still; And tears, from torrents, sink a prattling rill. Think what a pair of sparkling eyes are thine, And do not drown their Cupids in the brine; And think too on thy pretty dimpled cheek— Think of thy flaxen hair, whose beauties flow In broad luxuriance o'er thy breast of snow; And think too of that soft and polish'd neck. Think of thy lips, that kisses can impart, So ready from their ruby beds to start! Thus speak those lips, ‘We will be kiss'd again.’ And in the same sweet fascinating strain, Thy polish'd bosom says, ‘I will be press'd;’ And then thy cheek, the loveliest of our isle, Exclaims, ‘I will resume the cheerful smile, My bloom shall make some future lover blest.’ O listen to thy locks from Fashion hurl'd— ‘We will look Christian-like—we will be curl'd; We will not imitate a cow's strait tail:’ And then thy all-subduing taper waist, So full of rich desires, and then so chaste, Whist others are so marvellously frail— ‘I will be clasp'd by some smart swain, I say, Not, like a cabbage-stalk, be flung away.’ Thy heart too speaks! ‘Though now, alas! forlorn, There seems no reason for eternal sighing: Owl-like, a little let me mope and mourn, But not be ever swelling, groaning, dying.’ Hark! from thy hand, which thou dost wretched wring— ‘Give me,’ a finger cries, ‘another ring.’ Oh! canst thou hear it on such wishes dwell, And not indulge it with the bagatelle? Daughter of Grief, then hamper not thy charms, Who, really grown rebellious, pant for arms; Give way then to the roving mutineers— And shouldst thou say ‘Lord! who will take 'em in?’ Trust me, I'll entertain 'em, ev'ry skin— My bosom's open to the pretty dears. ODE. [Ah! this our world's a world of sad mishaps] Peter descanteth on the Precariousness of Life, wisheth to be at his own Disposal, and showeth no Objection to an emendation of Nature. Ah! this our world's a world of sad mishaps; Beset with Death's uncomfortable traps! Hard squeez'd we sometimes get away to groan: Now half the body's in the spiteful gin, And now the unlucky tail, to make us grin, So that we dare not call our souls our own. I do not like entails—I hate control— Jove!—give me the fee simple of my soul; Around this system let me range at ease, To stay, or quit it, whensoe'r I please. Amid the wonders of Creation's field, Strange! that existence should to trifles yield! Behold that promising Herculean boy: A zephyr on his infant cradle blows; Lo! out at once Life's little candle goes, The flame too of a parent's hope and joy. Thus shall the poor mean solitary worm Kill, in the acorn's kind protecting cell, The small oak-embryo, that had mock'd the storm, And smil'd upon the sulphur'd flash of hell; Had push'd its roots where Earth's deep centre lies, And with its tow'ring branches brav'd the skies. 'Tis a strange world we live in, to be sure; A world of wounds, I fear, without a cure! Dame Nature seems a sad unnat'ral mother: Methinks 'tis hard, one animal should die, Groan out his last, and ever close his eye, To treat with life and rosy health another. 'Tis strange indeed! yet true, tho' passing strange; Where'er the foot or eye of man can range, This munching, mad, devouring system reigns! O could our mortal palate feed on roses, As on their dainty essence, feed our noses, This world were then a pleasurable scene. 'Tis murder, murder, now, from morn to night! Look at a simple act that yields delight— The ploughman toiling thro' his fallow'd ground: Happy he turns the glebe for vegetation— Yet in this act how many a harmless nation Of worms, poor reptiles, feel the grinding wound! Whilst rooks, and crows, and magpies, hop behind, Alert and greedy, gobbling all they find! That 'tis a good world cannot be contended— I wish 'twere mended. OSGAR'S PRAYER.Elfrid, the beautiful daughter of Osgar, was a captive among the Druids, and designed as a sacrifice to the gods. Amidst a storm of thunder and lightning, he goes to the Druid mountain, in order to procure, by his supplications, and an offer of his own life upon the altar, his daughter's liberty. OSGAR. YE winds, that warring thus, around me rage, Cease your rude thunders on the wretch who dies; Poor is the triumph o'er desponding age, Whose energy is only in his sighs! Ye forked lightnings that around me flame, Ye mark two languid eyes, that weep and pray; Once, once, like you, high-kindling shone their beam 'Till Time, and dark Misfortune, dimm'd their ray. Forbear, alas! to thwart my way forlorn. Wet with the falling tears of fondest love; For life, I hear a captive daughter mourn, And court compassion from the Druid grove. My feebly bending form, and scanty hair, Grown white with grief, my tender cause should plead; Wake a small pity on my deep despair, And bid the Druids stay the bloody deed. If, on their hearts, my sorrows nought avail, What, without Elfrid, life, poor life, endears? Then kill me—then 'tis Mercy lulls the wail, Of one who counts the moments by his tears. TO THE DRUIDS. SEERS of high knowledge, lo, a grief-worn man, Whose only daughter is his soul's delight! For her a father woe-begone and wan, With horror darkens ev'n the shade of night. Fathers of Virtue, why this long delay? O lead your willing victim to the shrine: Quick let me close these eyes upon the day, That, Elfrid, light may beam for years on thine. Haste with the knife of Fate, ye Druid bands; And thus, my daughter's prison-door unbar: Forbear to bind with cords my wither'd hands— To struggle, were with Elfrid's life to war. Her eye will drop a pearl on Osgar's tomb; Her sighs be balm where'er my urn is laid— Those let her give, and I will bless my doom; I ask no happier offering to my shade. Fathers of knowledge, why this long delay? Speak, am I not a victim for yon sphere? When from your holy mandates did I stray, And drew from Virtue's wounded eye the tear? When did I cease your temples to adore? Or view'd unaw'd the Druids ancient fire? These rocks, these idols, I confess'd their pow'r, And rev'rent sung their wonders to my lyre. When was the faith of Osgar known to fail? What injur'd spirits of my slights complain? What spectre, midst the thunders of the gale, On Osgar mournful call'd, and call'd in vain? Have I not walk'd with many a sheeted ghost, 'Midst the dread silence of the midnight gloom: On moonlight mountains met the haggard host, How wild! with all their horrors from the tomb? Shrunk Penury, as crawling from the grave, Ne'er left with sorrowing downcast eye my door: Thanks to the gods, who wealth to Osgar gave, And taught its happy worth, to help the poor. A daughter's virtues are my only boast! A sweet simplicity, unspoil'd by art: Lo, with my Elfrid's voice, a world is lost! All, all forsakes me but a breaking heart. O spare the terrors of a blameless maid; And let my sufferings her dear days prolong: O! be these limbs along your altar laid; O'er bleeding Osgar hymn the victim's song. The sigh that wafts the parting soul away, Retires from others with unwilling flight— With joy, my spirit shall desert its clay, And bless you Druids for the cruel rite. Let not my Elfrid see my blood-stain'd hair, Nor cheek so pale, which saves her precious breath; A scene so sad, her gentle nature spare: Her wounded heart, so soft, would weep to death. Yet would my Elfrid see no frown appear, As sullen, sorrowing for the loss of life: I'll teach my languid cheek a smile to wear, And show its triumph in the tender strife. Enough of woe, her drooping strength will prove, When cold beneath the lonely turf I lie: The bleeding hist'ry of a parent's love, Will often dim the crystal of her eye. Ye gods! when dead, permit my ghost to roam, Peace to her turtle bosom to impart; To guard from pining thought her tender bloom, And snatch from woes o'erwhelming floods her heart. Thus, thus, attendant be my watchful shade, Till Fate, commanding, seal her dove-like eye; Then let me fondly clasp my darling maid, And add another glory to your sky. O deal the blow, and Elfrid's form release!— He said—the melting Druids heard his pray'r; Rever'd his virtues, bade him go in peace, And to a father's fondness gave the fair. DELIA; A PASTORAL ELEGY. Lo, the pride of the village is dead! Lo, the bloom of our vale is no more! Now Sorrow sits dumb in the shade, Where Rapture oft carol'd before. Like the morn she enliven'd the groves; Like the summer, gave life to the swain; For her smile was the seat of the Loves, And her voice the sweet song of the plain! O Delia, divine is thy name Thy merits we all shall revere; We shall dwell with delight on thy fame, And think of thy loss with a tear. Ev'n our children shall lisp in thy praise! Their instructress shall Innocence be; Who their little ambition shall raise, To resemble a fair one like thee. Though lodg'd in a church-yard so drear, Which the yew-tree surrounds with its gloom; Thy virtue a sun shall appear, And thy graces be flow'rs on thy tomb. MADRIGAL. [How sweet is every shepherd's song!] How sweet is every shepherd's song! How fair the vows that load his tongue! His soul with every sigh expires, His bosom flames with furious fires. This ev'ry day we seem to see; But when will Love and truth agree? When spiders, for the harmless fly, In silent ambush cease to lie; When foxes keen with poultry play, And from the lambkin run away; Then may the world with wonder see, That love and truth at last agree. SONG, BY SYLVIA. When first my shepherd told his tale, He droop'd and languish'd, look'd and sigh'd; ‘Good Heav'n!’ thought I, and then turn'd pale, ‘How often men for love have died!’ Then pond'ring well, thought I again, ‘'Tis pity kill so sweet a swain!’ With such a warmth my hand he prest, My heart was fill'd with wild alarms, That bouncing, bouncing at my breast, Cry'd, ‘Take poor Colin to your arms.’ And then my tongue began its strain, ‘'Tis pity kill so sweet a swain!’ Now wishes rise, his cause to plead, The mutineers, in saucy bands, And roar, ‘For shame to strike him dead, And have a murder on your hands!’ ‘Wishes, you're right,’ quoth I, ‘'tis plain— What then? What then! I sav'd the swain.’ ODE TO THE SUN. O thou, bright ruler of the day, To whom unnumber'd millions pray, And, kneeling, deem thee all divine; Eternal foe of inky Night, Who puttest all her imps to flight, Receive the poet's grateful line. I own I love thy early beam, That gilds the hill and vale and stream, And trees and cots and rural spires; And, happy, 'mid the valley's song, I listen to the minstrel throng, And, thankful, hail thy genial fires. Yet lo, the lords of this huge place London. Care not three straws for thy bright face, Nay, thy rich lamp with curses load; When thou gett'st up, they go to bed; And when the night-cap's on thy head, They stare, and flit like owls abroad. Yes, yes, indeed they oft protest, That thou'rt a most intruding beast; And lo, in triumph thus they say, ‘Behold our navy, Britain's pride! From pole to pole, our vessels glide, And sail as safe by night as day. ‘Want we a fruit of flavour fine?’ Exclaim the great—‘behold, the pine Is better warm'd by coal and tan: Not ev'n to one exotic plant The sun a perfect taste can grant— Deny the stubborn fact, who can?’ The footmen too, with winking eyes, Abuse thy journey up the skies; Messieurs Postillions, Mesdames Cooks— Content to lie a-bed all day, They hate, alas! thy rising ray, And curse thy all-observing looks. Vex'd to their houses to be driv'n, The great retire from routs, their heav'n, And break up in a horrid passion, And cry, ‘In times of old, indeed, The tasteless world a sun might need, But now the fool is out of fashion. ‘About his business let him go, And light on other systems throw, Vulgars! that never wax-lights handle! Nay, while a mutton-light remains, A sun with us no credit gains, But yields to ev'ry farthing candle.’ THE QUEEN OF FRANCE TO HER CHILDREN, Just before her Execution. AN ELEGIAC BALLAD. From my prison with joy could I go, And with smiles meet the savage decree, Were it only to sleep from my woe, Since the grave holds no terrors for me. But from you, O my children, to part! Oh! a coward I melt at my doom; Ye draw me to earth, and my heart Sighs for life, and shrinks back from the tomb. List, list not to Calumny's lie, For I know not of guilt and its fears; And when at my fate ye will sigh, My ghost shall rejoice in your tears. In blessings, ah! take my last breath! Dear babes of my bosom, adieu! May the cloud be dispers'd by my death, And open a sunshine for you. TO A LADY, Who wished not to be admired. Ah, foolish Delia! since you hate That people of your charms should prate; Give me that face, that air divine, And in exchange accept of mine. Thus shall I gain my heart's desire, And set a raptur'd world on fire— You'll too be pleas'd (no longer doubt ye) As folks won't say one word about ye. SONG. [Dear Phillida, do not my passion despise] Dear Phillida, do not my passion despise; Ah! wherefore disdain all my vows and my sighs? Can cruelty dwell with the dove? O Phillida, think not I mean to deceive; Whatever I tell thee, with safety believe; For Truth is the daughter of Love. Of beauty and grace thou hast got such a store; The eye that beholds thee, at once must adore; Nor wish from thine altar to rove: Distrust not, I beg thee, the pow'r of thy smile; The swain who now wooes thee, is void of all guile; And Truth is the daughter of Love. Yet, Phillida, let me confess in thine ear, I would fly from thy charms, with so much I revere, But their magic forbids me to move: And yet, as inconstancy governs the fair, Perhaps thou mayst smile, and thus end my despair Hope too is the daughter of Love. ODE ON FRENCH TASTE. 'Tis laughable to see a Frenchman swell; Proud of his tragic idol, Pierre Corneille, Baptiz'd, forsooth, le Grand! But our fop neighbours see things with strange eyes! Alas! Sublimity ne'er left her skies, To take a Frenchman by the hand. It is, indeed a very diff'rent dame— A meretricious, noisy lass, I ween; A bouncing giantess, with eyes of flame, And such a daring and Medusa mien! Trick'd out in flaunting lace, and stiff brocade, With cabbage-roses loaded, glaring, vast! Such is the Frenchman's song-inspiring maid; The name of this bald Brobdignag, Bombast. Sublimity's a sweet, majestic fair; So simple in her form, and speech, and paces; So elegant her manners and her air— A Juno dress'd by all the easy graces. TO TIME. AN ANACREONTIC. Come hither—pry'thee haste, old Time, And see what joys amongst us reign; The bottle, music, girls, and rhime, And Friendship's soul, delight the scene. Then hither pr'ythee, Time, repair, And taste the pleasures, Gods should share. The Tuscan juice profusely flows; We sing of Love, and Delia's charms; When Morning warns us to repose, We clasp a fav'rite in our arms. Then hither, &amp;c. Ah, could our joys for ever last! But, Time, thy minutes fly too fast: Yet wouldst thou pass one evening here, Thou'dst make each hour a thousand year. Then hither, &amp;c. SONG. [Ye gentil 'squires, give over sighs] Ye gentil 'squires, give over sighs, To gain regard in ladies eyes, And make them doat upon ye; For love has long been kick'd to door, Because the little god is poor— Who's welcome without money? Try, gentil sirs, a diff'rent scheme; For truly 'tis an idle dream To woo with words of honey: Change (if ye wish their hearts to fix) Your hearts into a coach and six, And coin your sighs to money! TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Lone minstrel of the moonlight hour, Who charm'st the silent list'ning plain, A hapless pilgrim treads thy bow'r, To hear thy solitary strain. How soothing is the song of woe, To me, whom Love hath doom'd to pine! For, 'mid those sounds that plaintive flow, I hear my sorrows mix with thine. DINAH; OR, MY LADY'S HOUSEKEEPER. Just forty-five, was Mistress Dinah's age, My lady's housekeeper—stiff, dry, and sage, Quoting old proverbs oft, with much formality: A pair of flannel cheeks compos'd her face; Red were her eyes, her nose of snipe-bill race, Which took a deal of snuff, of Scottish quality. Her small prim mouth bore many a hairy sprig, Resembling much the bristles on a pig: She likewise held a handsome length of chin, Tapering away to sharpness like a pin. Her teeth so yellow much decay bespake, As every other tooth her mouth had fled; Thus, when she grinn'd, they seem'd a garden-rake, Or sheep's bones planted round a flow'ret bed. Her hair ('clep'd carrots by the wits) was red, Sleek comb'd upon a roll around her head; Moreover comb'd up very close behind— No wanton ringlets waving in the wind! Upon her head a small mob-cap she plac'd, Of lawn so stiff, with large flow'r'd ribbon grac'd, Yclept a knot and bridle, in a bow, Of scarlet flaming, her long chin below. A goodly formal handkerchief of lawn, Around her scraggy neck, with parchment skin, Was fair and smooth, with starch precision drawn, So that no prying eye might peep within. Yet had it peep'd, it had espied no swell, No lovely swell—no more than on a cat; For, lo! was Dinah's neck (I grieve to tell) As any tombstone, or a flounder, flat. Now on this handkerchief so starch and white, Was pinn'd a Barcelona, black and tight. A large broad-banded apron, rather short, Surrounded her long waist, with formal port. On week-days were black worsted mittens worn; Black silk, on Sundays, did her arms adorn. Long, very long, was Mistress Dinah's waist; The stiff stay high before, for reasons chaste; A scarlet petticoat she gave to view— With a broad plaited back she wore a gown, Of stuff, of yellow oft, and oft of brown, And oft a damask, well beflower'd with blue. Moreover, this same damask gown, or stuff, Had a large sleeve, and a long ruffle cuff. Black worsted stockings on her legs she wore; Black leather shoes too, which small buckles bore, Compos'd of shining silver, also square, Holding a pretty antiquated air. Shrill was her voice, that whistled through her beard; And tunes, at times, were most discordant heard, Harsh grating on poor John the footman's ear; Harsh grating on the ears of house-maids too, Postillion eke, who curs'd her for a shrew, And kitchen-wench, whom Mis'ry taught to swear. All, all but Jehu, felt her pow'rful tongue, Whose happier ear was sooth'd by sweeter song. No company but Jehu's did she keep, In horse-flesh, and a coach, profoundly deep; My lady's coachman, stout, and young, and ruddy; Great friends were they!—full oft, indeed, together, They walk'd, regardless of the wind and weather, So pleas'd each other's happiness to study. For Friendship, to a zephyr sinks a storm— Turns to a pigmy, Danger's giant form— Nought casts a dread on Friendship's steady eye: Thus did the couple seek the darkest grove; Where Silence, and sweet Meditation, rove; Where Sol, intrusive, was forbid to pry. Greatly in sentences did she delight, So pious! putting people in the right; And often in the pray'r-book would she look— Where matrimony was much thumb'd indeed, Because she oft'nest here God's word did read, The sweetest page in all the blessed book. All on the Bible too did Dinah pore, Where chaste Susanna nearly was a wh?, By wicked elders almost overcome: King David's actions too did Dinah read, A man of God's own heart—but call'd indeed, A wicked fornicating rogue by some. Of Solomon, admir'd she much the song; Could read the monarch's wisdom all day long— And where's the wonder? lo, the gallant Jew, Of mortal hearts the great queen passion knew: Thus sung he of the sparrow and the dove, And pour'd instruction through the voice of Love. John Bunyan read she too, and Kempis Tom, Who plainly show'd the way to kingdom-come. So modest was she, she got turn'd away Susan the kitchen-wench, for harmless play With Dick the Driver—likewise harmless Dick, Because he took from Susan's lips a kiss, Because too, Susan gave him up the bliss, Without a scream, a faint-fit, or a kick. If John the footman's eye on Lucy leer'd, My lady's maid, she watch'd him like a cat; And if the slightest word of love she heard, Quick in the fire indeed was all the fat— Off were the couple trundled—man and maid— John for a rogue, and Lucy for a jade. If e'er she heard of some forsaken lass, Who lost, by dire mishap, her maiden fame, At once she call'd her trollop, minx of brass, Strumpet, and ev'ry coarse opprobrious name. Small was the mercy Dinah kept in store For sinful flesh—the smallest for a wh?. So modest Dinah! if she saw two cats Ogling and pawing with their pretty pats, Kissing and squinting love, with frisking hops; Fir'd at the action, what would Dinah do? Slip down her hand, and slily take her shoe, Then launch in thunder at their am'rous chops. With pigeons 'twas the same, and other birds— All who made love, came in for bitter words; Poor simple souls, amidst the genial ray, Whom simple Nature call'd to simple play; But Dinah call'd it vile adulteration, A wicked, impudent abomination. It happen'd on a day, that grievous cries, By Dinah pour'd, created great surprise— Ill, very ill, in bed, alas! she lay: A dreadful cholic—her good lady wept, Gave her rich cordials—to her bedside crept, When Dinah begg'd that she would go away. Down went my lady to the parlour strait, Fearful that Dinah soon would yield to fate; And full of sorrow as my lady went, Sighs for her maid's recovery back she sent. Lo, Doctor Pestle comes to yield relief— He feels her pulse—is solemn, sage, and brief; Prescribeth for the cholic—nought avails; On Dinah, lo, the dire disorder gains; Stronger and faster flow the cholic pains, Fear, trembling, paleness, ev'ry soul assails. ‘Poor Dinah!’ sighs each mouth around the room, Join'd to a length'ning face of dread and gloom. At last, poor Dinah pours a death-like groan— A ghostly terror seizeth ev'ry one: My lady hears the cry, alas! below— She sends for Doctor Pestle—Pestle straight Runs to my lady—‘Doctor, what's her fate? Speak, is it death, dear doctor, yes, or no?’ ‘Not death, but life,’ cries Pestle, ‘forc'd that squall; A little Jehu's come to light, that's all.’ TO CHLOE. Let Sorrow seek her native night, For why should mortals court the tear? Joy, joy should wing each moment's flight, And Echo nought but rapture hear. I'll gather wisdom from the dove, And make my life a life of love. While youth sits sparkling in thine eyes, And lips are rich with many a kiss; Aloud the voice of Nature cries, ‘I form'd those charms alone for bliss: Go, nymph, learn wisdom from my dove, And be thy life a life of love.’ THE YOUNG FLY, AND THE OLD SPIDER.In this original and beautiful fable, the poet alludeth to the arts of men, who, by flattery, &amp;c. are constantly laying snares for Innocence. The bard, moreover, showeth, that Prudence may smile at the machinations of a great rogue. FRESH was the breath of morn—the busy breeze, As poets tell us, whisper'd through the trees, And swept the dew-clad blooms with wing so light, Phœbus got up, and made a blazing fire, That gilded every country house and spire, And smiling, put on his best looks so bright. On this fair morn, a spider who had set, To catch a breakfast, his old waving net, With curious art upon a spangled thorn; At length, with gravely-squinting longing eye, Near him espied a pretty plump young fly, Humming her little orisons to morn. ‘Good morrow, dear Miss Fly,’ quoth gallant Grim— ‘Good morrow, sir,’ reply'd Miss Fly to him— ‘Walk in, Miss, pray, and see what I'm about:’ ‘I'm much oblig'd t'ye, sir,’ Miss Fly rejoin'd, ‘My eyes are both so very good, I find, That I can plainly see the whole, without.’ ‘Fine weather, Miss’—‘Yes, very very fine,’ Quoth Miss—‘prodigious fine indeed:’ ‘But why so coy?’ quoth Grim, ‘that you decline To put within my bow'r your pretty head?’ ‘'Tis simply this,’ Quoth cautious Miss, ‘I fear you'd like my pretty head so well, You'd keep it for yourself, sir—who can tell?’ ‘Then let me squeeze your lovely hand, my dear, And prove that all your dread is foolish, vain.’— ‘I've a sore finger, sir; nay more, I fear You really would not let it go again.’ ‘Poh, poh, child, pray dismiss your idle dread; I would not hurt a hair of that sweet head— Well, then, with one kind kiss of friendship meet me:’ ‘La, sir,’ quoth Miss, with seeming artless tongue, ‘I fear our salutation would be long; So loving, too, I fear that you would eat me.’ So saying, with a smile she left the rogue, To weave more lines of death, and plan for prog. MADRIGAL. [When Love and Truth together play'd] When Love and Truth together play'd, So cheerful was the shepherd's song! How happy, too, the rural maid! How light the minutes wing'd along! But Love has left the sighing vale, And Truth no longer tells her tale. Sly stealing, see, from scene to scene, The watchful Jealousy appear; And pale Distrust with troubled mien, The rolling eye, and list'ning ear! For Love has left the sighing vale, And Truth no longer tells her tale. Ah! shall we see no more the hour, That wafted rapture on its wing? With murmurs shall the riv'let pour, That prattled from its crystal spring? Yes, yes, while Love forsakes the vale, And Truth no longer tells her tale. TO CHLOE. Five thousand years have roll'd away, And yet ten thousand blockheads say, ‘O Pleasure, thou'rt the devil:’ While Nature bids them joy embrace, They fling the blessing in her face; Now this is most uncivil! But I'm not one of those, thank Heav'n! Ingratitude was never giv'n To my good heart, I'm sure: Would Chloe yield a thousand kisses, Upon my knees I'd seize the blisses, And beg a thousand more. ODE TO A COUNTRY 'SQUIRE, ON THE EVE OF HIS MARRIAGE. Great 'Squire! you're now upon the eve of marriage, And, O great 'squire, I know you are a hog; Indeed so sad a brute in all your carriage, You'll freely give your wife up for a dog. This day will yield a fair-one to your arms, Whose dow'r are all the virtues, and her charms. Forc'd by the frown of Poverty to wed, With deep regret, I see th' unwilling fair Dragg'd from her lover, to thy hated bed— Sold by a cruel parent to Despair: See her deck'd out by garish, idle Art, To captivate thy vulgar, savage heart, And live a tyrant's slave—a servile wife! How like the victim lamb, in ribbons drest. Led from its vale and sport, so lately blest, To lose its sweetly-inoffensive life! Now 'squire, I'll tell you how 'twill be ere long— (O could the thunder of the poet's song, Preventing, dash thine iron cheek with shame!) Thou'lt quarrel with her virtues, peerless beauty! Bid her ‘like spaniels, understand her duty;’ Upbraid her with the want of wealth and name. Wilt say she came a beggar to thy house; That through mere charity thou took'st her in; Tell her she ‘crawls about thee like a louse, Eternally a torment to thy skin.’ How dares thy fancy nurse the lying thought; How durst, alas! thy villain tongue declare, That, when to thee the beauteous maid was brought, Thy offer'd hand with honour cloth'd the fair? Know with the virtues of the charming maid, Know, with her beauties thou'rt too well repaid; Ev'n by a smile, that all our envy draws: Ah! when she yieldeth to thy lips her kiss, And bosom yields thee (too sublime a bliss!) The luckless virgin barters gems for straws. At length thou'lt leave her for a wench—thy cook; She will enjoy thy cash, and love-clad look; The turnspit-bastards, to thine eye be dear— Thy wife, with sweetness bordering on divine, Pale wretch! in secret solitude shall pine, Mourn to the wind, and drop the silent tear. To Heav'n, for help, she lifts the brimfull eye! Kind Heav'n resumes the gift its bounty gave— With happy heart thou hear'st her parting sigh, And drunken, madding, dancest o'er her grave. Thy cook-wench soon becomes thy proper mate, And leaves thee soon for lads who clean thy stables; Noses thee, pulls thine ears, and pounds thy pate, And, with much justice, on thee turns the tables. Ma'am Cook shall oft contrive to see thee skipping, To hide thee from her rage, from room to room; Urg'd by a ladle-full of broth or dripping, Or by the strong persuasions of the broom. To plague a little more thine aching head, And keep thee, mournful devil, upon thorns; Shall take thy own postillion to her bed, And, threat'ning, dare thee once to mention horns. THE COMPLAINT OF MIRZA, TO SELIMA HIS MISTRESS. From the Persian. Where is the nymph of Sardi's green domain, The nymph, whom every bard of Persia sings? To find the wand'rer out, and sooth my pain, Sweet bird of morn, to Mirza lend thy wings. But wherefore seek the nymph of Sardi's vale, Who sullen slies where Horar's waters roll; Scorns all my plaints, that mourn along the gale, And scorns the surge of grief, that sinks my soul? Ah! can that cheek where Beauty's summer dwells, Retain a smile, whilst Mirza's sorrows flow? Ah! can that heart, that every softness swells, Forbear to heave on Mirza's songs of woe? Come, like the morn, pure virgin of delight, And, blushing, chase the cloud of Mirza's fears Come, like the sun upon the dews of night, And with thy radiance, smile away my tears. HAWKING, A BALLAD Made at Falconers' Hall, Yorkshire Come, sportsmen, away—the morning how fair! To the wolds, to the wolds, let us quickly repair; Bold Thunder Names of two hawks. and Lightning Names of two hawks. are mad for the game, And Death Names of hawks. and the Devil Names of hawks. are both in a flame. See, Backers The head falconer., a kite!—a mere speck in the sky— Zounds! out with the owl—lo, he catches his eye— Down he comes with a sweep—be unhooded each hawk; Very soon will they both to the gentleman talk. They're at him—he's off—now they're o'er him again: Ah! that was a stroke—see! he drops to the plain— They rake him—they tear him—he flutters, he cries, He struggles, he turns up his talons, and dies. See, a magpie; let fly—how he flutters and shambles! How he chatters, poor rogue! now he darts to the brambles: Out again—overtaken—his spirits now flag— Flip! he gives up the ghost—good night Mister Mag. Lo, a heron! let loose—how he pokes his long neck, And darts, with what vengeance, but vainly, his beak! Egad, he shifts well—now he feels a death-wound, And, with Thunder and Lightning rolls tumbling to ground. Thus we falconers sport—now homewards we stray, To fight o'er the bottle, the wars of the day: And in honour, at night, of the chase and its charms, Sink sweetly to rest, with a dove in our arms. ODE TO HEALTH. Peter protesteth against Physic. Sweet nymph, of rosy cheek and sprightly mien, Who, vagrant, playful, on the hills art seen, E'er Sol illumines the grey world below; Now, doe-like, skipping wild from vale to vale, Enamour'd of the rills and fresh'ning gale, From whose mild wing the streams of fragrance flow. O! 'midst those hills and vales contented stray— Thou wilt be ruin'd if thou com'st away— Doctors too much like man-traps lie in wait— They'll tell thee, beauteous nymph, ten thousand lies, That they can mend thy bloom, and sparkling eyes— Avoid, avoid, my dear, the dangerous bait. Like the first woodcock of the year, The instant that he dares appear, The country's up to kill him—dog and gun! So when thou showest, nymph, thy rosy face, I see at once an Æsculapian chase; And, oh! if caught, thou wilt not find it fun. Lo, this proclaims he vendeth at his shop Rich immortality in his dear drop; Another dire impostor, bawling louder, Swears that it lodges only in his powder. These raggamuffins have the name of quack, Prepar'd to put thy beauties on the rack— But then, the regulars!—ay, what are they? The regulars, my love, are gentlemen, Whom very justly nine in ten, I with an eye of no small dread survey. The regulars in physic, I'm afraid, And all th' irregulars who ply the trade, Are just like men that form an army; Whichever at you lifts his gun, alas! Will soon convince you what must come to pass— The shot will very comfortably warm ye. Indeed, the only diff'rence will be this, Nor quack nor regular the mark will miss; The art of killing they are all so pat in; On broken English, fate by that you seek; By this, upon the wings of mongrel Greek, And pie-bald Latin. Then once more let me bid thee, blooming lass, To keep, like Babylon's great king, at grass, And thou wilt find it not an idle notion: Tis fair, that I should try to save thy life— And know that Death is never half so rife, As when the country swarms with pill and potion. O blooming wand'rer of the breezy hills, Beware then of those potions and those pills— Be kisses all thy physic, rose-lipp'd Health; Kisses, my easy nostrum, ne'er are rife, For ever pregnant, lovely nymph, with life, And sweeter when they are enjoy'd by stealth. I've built a neat snug cottage on the plain, Pr'ythee drop in some evening on thy swain. TO CHLOE. Chloe, I live, and live for thee alone; Trust me, there's nought worth living for, beside: Nought for thine absence, Cloe, can atone, Though Phœbus shines, and Nature pours her pride. Lo, full of innocence the lambkins bleat; The brooks in sweetest murmurs purl along; The lark's, the linnet's voices too, are sweet— But what are these to Chloe's tuneful tongue? With ev'ry balm, the breath of Zephyr blows; But thine can yield a thousand times more blisses: I own the fragrance of the blushing rose, But, ah! how faint to balm of Chloe's kisses! Ye gods! I mark thy frown, and scornful eye, And now thy bridling chin of scorn I see; And now I hear thee, so contemptuous, cry, ‘What are my kisses, saucy swain, to thee?’ True, dearest Chloe—yet each kiss divine, Which dwelleth on thy lips so very teasing, Would quickly change its nature were it mine, And rapt'rous prove—superlatively pleasing! Love is a generous god, and 'tis his pleasure To see the gold he gives, in circulation— Then cease to hoard such quantities of treasure, And be afraid to put him in a passion. Thy beauties should the angry god divide, And throw amongst thy sex, 'twould be alarming; And not a little mortify thy pride, To meet, dear Chloe, ev'ry woman charming. ODE. [Th' unsteady mind is my abomination] Peter praiseth Constancy. Th' unsteady mind is my abomination; I curse the whiffling and inconstant passion: From me, dear Constancy, don't, don't depart— I love the cooing turtle and her mate— The Proteus Mutability I hate— A demon when he holds the human heart; A flutt'ring straw, to wander so inclin'd; Keeping the company of ev'ry wind. Old customs let us not exchange for new; They sit so easy—just like an old shoe: And let us not, as though from Wisdom's schools, Fancy our forefathers were arrant fools. Ev'n in religious matters, folks love change; Scheming new roads to Heav'n, they wildly range; Hunting with noses all so keen, about: I like an honest constancy in souls, In spite of interest, that our race controls, Turning, like pudding-bags, men inside out. In Ireland, not long since, th' unlucky cattle, And that sad plague, call'd Murrain, had a battle; When Murrain prov'd a most victorious foe— For ram and ewe, 'Squire Bull, and Madam Cow, And lusty Mister Bull, and Mistress Sow, Were by this rogue in multitudes laid low. Numbers indeed resign'd their breath, To fill the gaping tombs of death. Now in the parish, 'midst the murrain's rage, Which all the farrier's skill could not assuage, Liv'd a good priest—Father M'Shane; Famous afar for wonder-working pray'rs; Minding not sins one pin, though thick as hares, Safe were the souls of the profane! One Sunday he desir'd to say his masses, Amidst the field—where beasts of various classes, Infected by this murrain, might appear: His congregation follow'd, to be sure; Bull, cow, pig, sheep, surrounded him for cure, Yielding his masses an attentive ear. What happen'd? Disappointed was the Devil, Father M'Shane's good prayers destroy'd the evil; Bull, cow, and sheep, so hungry, graz'd the plains, And pigs, half famish'd, fell upon the grains. In short, their healths and appetites return'd— Father M'Shane, what? laugh'd, while Satan mourn'd. Proud of his deed, the holy father went To a rich Protestant, with good intent, To make the murrain from his cattle fly: ‘Father M'Shane,’ the farmer cry'd in scorn, ‘My cattle all were Church-of-England born, And in that holy faith they all shall die.’ A LITTLE SKETCH OF A CERTAIN MOST MERCIFUL AND LITTLE JUDGE. ? Hunc tu, Romane, caveto; Hic niger est ? Lo, that be-periwigg'd black knave in scarlet, The robes deep blushing for their master's soul; With what solemnity he sits, the varlet! With what sublimity his eye-balls roll! With what a grave pomposity he blows What has been often pull'd—his mean pug-nose! With what a sanctity pronouncing death! How pleas'd in secret swells the fatal breath! Religion-cloth'd, each sentence moves along, While thirst for murder prompts the villain's tongue. Look at this judge—this fellow, out of court! The very first in Roguery's hawk-ey'd school! A knave, committing crimes of ev'ry sort; To whom Hypocrisy's an arrant fool. ‘There's no such man,’ the world exclaims.—That's true; But such a monster, ev'ry day we view. SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.Is it not astonishing that the life of so great a man as Sir Joshua Reynolds should not have been written? A painter who possessed more of the charming art than almost any single professor that ever existed. But Fame proclaimeth Mr. James Boswell to be big with the biography of this celebrated artist, and ready to sink into the straw! See Johnson's angry ghost, ye gods, arise! He drops his nether lip, and rolls his eyes; And roars, O Bozzy, Bozzy, spare the dead! Raise not thy biographic guillotine; Decapitate no more with that machine, Nor frighten Horror with a second head: ‘From Reynolds' neck, the pond'rous weapon keep: Cease, Anthropophagus, to murder sleepThere is a wonderful energy as well as sonorous sublimity in this polysyllabic expression of the ghost of our immortal moralist and lexicographer, not obvious to the minora sidera of literature. The word anthropophagus is a derivative from the Greek, signifying man-eater; and Mr. James Boswell having regaled most plentifully on the carcase of Dr. Johnson, and meaning to make as hearty a meal on the body of Sir Joshua Reynolds, furnisheth the perturbed spectre with an appellative of fortunate propriety.!’ Johnson and Reynolds, lo, for ever lost! Of no great man has Bozzy now to boast; Of no rich table now can Bozzy brag: Indeed, like faded beauties, he will say, ‘Envy must own I've had my shining day.’— What wert thou?—an illuminated rag! But what's become of boastful Bozzy now? Deep sunk in mournful solitude art thou! Amidst thy small tin-box, so drear and dark, No courted genius casts a lucky spark! Nothing to gild thy solitary tinder, Save the rude flint and steel of Peter Pindar. AN EPITAPH ON A FRIEND. Though here in death thy relics lie, Thy worth shall live in Mem'ry's eye; Who oft at night's pale noon shall stray, To bathe with tears thy lonely clay. Here Pity too, in weeds forlorn, Shall, mingling sighs, be heard to mourn; With Genius drooping o'er thy tomb, In sorrow for a brother's doom. ODE ON THE CHOLERIC CHARACTER. Peter reprehendeth Rational Creatures, for their violent Anger against Inanimates. Happy the man whose heart of such a sort is, As holds more butter-milk than aqua-fortis! But, Lord! how passionate are certain folk! How like the sea, reflecting ev'ry form. So placid!—the next instant in a storm, Dashing against the inoffensive rock; Mounting towards the skies with such a thunder, As though it wish'd (the lev'ler!) to bring under Sun, moon, and stars, and tear them into tatters— Such passions verily are serious matters. Men in morality should ne'er be idle, But for those passions make a strong curb bridle. When lofty man doth quarrel with a pin, In man resides the folly or the sin— Not in the brass, by which his finger's spitted— For with a small philosophy we find, That, as a pin is not endow'd with mind, Of malice call'd prepense, pin stands acquitted: Thus then his awkwardness must bear the blame, And thus to persecute the pin's a shame. Many inanimates, as well as pins, Suffer for others' fooleries and sins. How oft a drunken blockhead damns a post, That overturns him, breaks his shins, or head: Whose eyes should certainly have view'd the coast, And have avoided this same post so dread; Whereas he should have spar'd his idle cries, And only damn'd his own two blinking eyes. A little Welchman, Welchman-like indeed, Hot as Chian, that is to say— A bachelor—and therefore ev'ry need, Was, for subsistence, forc'd to him to pray: This Bachelor, to satisfy withal His gullet, Put into a small pot—indeed too small, A pullet. The pullet's legs were not to be confin'd; So out they pok'd themselves, so sleek and white: The Welchman curs'd her legs with wicked mind, And push'd them in again, with monstrous spite The pullet liking not the pot's embrace, So very warm—indeed a nat'ral case, Pok'd forth her shrinking legs again, so fair; With seeming much uneasiness, in troth, Objecting to her element of broth, And wishing much to take a little air. The Cambro-Briton waxing red and hot, And highly foaming too, just like the pot. Ran to the legs, and shov'd them in once more; But, lo! his oaths and labour all were vain; Out pok'd the pullet's boiling legs again; Which put the Welchman's passions in a roar! What will not mortals, urg'd by rage and sin, do? Mad at defeat, and with a dev'lish scowl, He seizes with ferocity the fowl, And, full of vengeance, whirls her out at window. TO MISS HARRINGTON. OF BATH. ‘Alas, alas, I've lost a day!’ Good Titus once was heard to say, And sorely, sorely to repent it— What was it made the emp'ror groan: I'd give a good round sum, I own, To be inform'd how 'twas he spent it. Dear Titus, quickly leave thy tomb; Enter of Harrington the room, Whom music and each grace reveres— I'll answer for't, thou wilt not say, ‘Alas, alas, I've lost a day;’ But, ‘Gods! I've found five hundred years!’ ANACREON TO HIS LYRE. Sent to a Lady. Fain would I strike the harp to kings, And give to war the sounding strings; But, lo! the chords rebellious prove, And tremble with the notes of love. In vain I quarrel with my lyre, In vain I change the rebel wire; Boldly I strike to war again, But love prevails through all the strain. Oh! since not master of the shell, Ye kings, and sons of war, farewell; And since the Loves the song require, To Venus I resign the lyre. 'Twas thus, O nymph, with Attic tongue, The gay Anacreon pour'd the song, A bard belov'd by me: And who the Poet's harp can blame? Perhaps old Greece could boast a dame, With every grace like thee. ODE. [A man may, in the cold dim eve of life] Peter modestly, delicately, and tenderly, pleadeth against the excessive Damages lately given for certain illegal Liberties in Love-matters. A man may, in the cold dim eve of life, By way of sunshine, take a pretty wife, To warm him, as King David did of yore Here is a flagrant error of the lyric bard. It was not a wife, but a pair of pretty black-eyed Hebrew lasses, whom the monarch chose for his loving companions.; Kiss her neat little finger, pat her cheek, Toy with the snowy beauties of her neck— No more! Preventing thus each rake of flesh and sin From impudently stepping in. Thus toying, mumbling, chuckling, the old fool, Who wanteth much the birch of Cupid's school, Expects his wife, so soft, and so divine, To fancy ev'ry sublunary bliss In ev'ry toying monkey-trick and kiss, And round his neck, her arms with rapture twine; Just like the fragrant pea, with blooms so thick, That curls her tendrils round a rotten stick! For him to raise his hedge, and bar his gate, Is nat'ral—sad is trespass on th' estate; For who, alas! can sit with silent ease, And see a neighbour's pig among his peas? But why should ?????? be afraid of horns, Who married a poor squeal, starv'd cat, for money? Heav'ns! what should put the judge's breech on thorns? Where, for the wasps, alas! is madam's honey? 'Tis sweetness tempts the insects from the skies; Gall needeth not a flapper for the flies. So furious is this judge against crim. con. That poor Adultery is just undone: Afraid to write, or squeeze, or wink his eye, Nay, waft the soul's soft wishes on a sigh! Woe to the wicked cornu-factors now! Ten, twenty, thirty, forty thousand pounds, For him to pay, who milks his neighbour's cow; Stealing by night so slily to his grounds! ‘O 'tis so vile, so wicked an affair! Dreadful a neighbour's honour to ensnare— Take his dear spouse without his leave, indeed! What! of his bosom steal the tender wife! The pigeon to his feet, prolonging life, Of sinking age the sweet supporting reed! ‘O that the law would make such doings death!’ Thus roars the jealous judge, with thund'ring breath. O ??????! rave not thus with anger pale, But let thy fav'rite Justice hold the scale: What though we must condemn the smuggled bliss; Ten thousand pounds are too much for a kiss. THE ADDRESS OF THE FAIRIES TO THE LADIES OF R?, IN CORNWALL: Left on the Dial-plate in the Garden. Ye gentle maids of Camborne's Druid vale, Admir'd and lov'd by all our elfin train; Your worth with wonder and delight we hail, And pen, unseen, for you the tuneful strain. Beneath these oaks our happy court we keep, When midnight rules the world with solemn sway; While you, forgetful, sink to silent sleep, We, blithsome, gambol 'mid the moonlight ray. Sweet is the spot where Innocence is seen— Dear is the valley where the Virtues dwell: By such allur'd, we trip this dewy green, Far from the sound of Riot's savage yell. Health, rose-lipp'd Health, shall crown your crystal rill, And bid with ev'ry balm your zephyrs blow; Unceasing song shall charm the echoing hill, And Plenty robe with bloom, the vale below. Thus wing'd with joy shall glide your golden hours, Till for yon skies ye bid the world adieu; And when at last ye leave these blissful bow'rs, Your little weeping friends will wander too. OBERON, PUCK, BLOSSOM, MAB, &amp;c. TO CHARLOTTE, On New-Year's Day. Behold another year succeed! But, Charlotte, thou hast nought to dread, Since Time will ever beauty spare: Time knows what's perfect, and well knows, 'Twould take him ages to compose Another damsel half so fair. TO CYNTHIA. Cynthia, I own my heart is lost, And dare confess it with a boast; It does a credit to my sighs; For who like thee displays a face, Or who like thee abounds with grace, Or sports like thee a pair of eyes? But, ah! 'tis folly to complain, Because I hear no sighs again, A soft, a sweet return for mine; Love is a rogue, who bade me gaze; And when he saw my bosom blaze, Refus'd to raise a spark in thine. HYMN TO SILENCE. O silence, to our earth by Wisdom giv'n, Yet from the fashionable circles driv'n To breathing zephyrs, and the limpid stream, Whose murmurs sweetly sooth the shepherd's dream? For thee I often sigh, but sigh in vain, When Folly stuns me with her noisy train. Oh! how I wish thy presence, when the 'squire Impertinently bursts into my room; Hallooing from the kennel's howl and mire, And casting o'er my day, a midnight gloom. Yet if his sister Phil. comes giggling in, And talks of fashions, op'ra, ball, and play; Methinks, my ears can bear the varied din, Which forceth thee, mute maid, to run away. Yet 'tis not long I wish thee thus apart; So much thy presence glads, at times, my heart— For when I clasp the nymph, so fair and young, And steal a sweet acquaintance with her lip, I wish thee in the room at once to skip, And gently take possession of her tongue. CECILIA. [Cecilia, as 'twas Christmas time] Cecilia, as 'twas Christmas time, Resolving on a flight sublime, Pepar'd to pass her holidays in Heav'n: The goddess then brush'd up her wings, Pick'd up her trinkets, her best things. Her harp, and songs, and pen, by Phœbus giv'n. When in rush'd Music—‘Madam, no, ‘Indeed you must not, shall not go’— ‘Poh! hold thy tongue,’ the goddess cry'd, ‘thou Ninny; Think'st thou I'll quit dear Bath, my pride, And not an equal charm provide? Thou stupid creature, to forget Rauzzini.’ SONG. [Ah, Delia! I will not complain] Ah, Delia! I will not complain, That another is blest in thy charms; Yet allow me to envy the swain, Whom Delia can take to her arms. I confess that no merit is mine— That of Delia I ought to despair: Since thy virtues, dear maid, are divine, And thy form like an angel's so fair. On Fate let me fix all the blame, Who show'd me thy form of desire; When I caught from thy beauty a flame, That only with life can expire. Yet, Delia, before I depart, Ah! do not one favour deny; Though Fortune denies me thy heart, Let thy pity accept of its sigh. MADRIGAL. [Sweet girl, the man's a downright fool] Sweet girl, the man's a downright fool, That asks for constancy in love— Variety's a charming school: How nat'ral for the heart to rove! A form like thine can never cloy— And lo, thy graces, what a plenty! Then tell me, why should one enjoy The beauties that suffice for twenty? AN APOLOGY FOR INCONSTANCY. TO PHILLIS. ‘How 'tis thou governest above, I know not verily, O Love; But, to my grief, this truth I know, That Folly leads thy dance below.’ 'Twas thus I spleenful cry'd, when first my heart From thy black sparklers felt the stinging dart: In dismal crape I dress'd up many a ballad; Mad at sour looks, I look'd for nought but smile, Not dreaming once that vinegar and oil Produc'd a fine effect upon a sallad. My wary wisdom now is on its guard, And ev'ry day, I, Peter, am prepar'd To catch my little Syren out of humour: A disappointment at a ball perchance, Not standing up the foremost in a dance, Which forms a feast for wide-mouth'd Madam Rumour, May give thee fidgets, put thee out of sorts— What slighteth lady loveth such reports? Grant that thine eyes, with sullen clouds o'ercast, Let fall, alas! a hearty show'r of rain— Soon will those suns (for long it cannot last) Peep out with radiance on the world again. When, lo! their beams will seem a great deal brighter, My spirits also dancing ten times lighter. Life is too mawkish, if 'tis always sweet; At times, a disappointment is a treat. Some scout this doctrine—Psha! the vapid asses! Lord, drown them in a hogshead of molasses. When majesty was in a monstrous passion, And grimly Thurlow thunder'd out d?mnation, And Leeds and Hawk'sb'ry join'd their jowls together, Brewing, like witches of Macbeth, foul weather; I cannot truly say my heart was light: Indeed the bard found something like a fright; Indeed I trembled at gathering gloom; But when the cloud so harmless pass'd away, My spirits all so frolicksome and gay, To dance their jig, had scarcely elbow-room. I laugh'd at each dark terrifying mien, And mock'd the dread that rush'd through ev'ry vein. Yet, is it possible, ye tuneful Nine (Doubtless the thought the great Apollo shocks), That verses vended by a bard divine, Can put his sacred legs into the stocks? Yes! and his sacred head into the pillory; So say the law archives of Lent and Hillary. Some, Moderation kick, like fools, to door, And wish their passions always in a roar. Ah! would those madmen wisely time employ, They ought to be œconomists of joy. Too frequent and too violent a motion, Will tear the best machinery to pieces; This doctrine to young masters is a potion, A nauseous potion too to love-sick misses. Beyond the extravagance of rhime, Beyond the flight of thought sublime, I chase not blisses thus beyond all measure— Rapture's a fiery hunter to bestride; Indeed I wish not madman-like to ride, But calm on that sweet filly, christen'd Pleasure. Phillis, I will not always have thy smile; At times, I'll give thee liberty to pout: Such is my plan, the minutes to beguile; Sometimes in Heav'n, my love, and sometimes out. Variety affords a zest to life— But, mum!—we must not say this to a wife. HYMN TO LIFE. Parent of Pleasure, and of many a groan, I should be loath to part with thee, I own, Dear life! To tell the truth, I'd rather lose a wife, Should Heav'n e'er deem me worthy of possessing That best, that most invaluable blessing. Some people talk of thee with much sang froid, As one too pitiful to be enjoy'd; But thou'rt a most delightful girl with me— A hundred thousand pretty things are thine; Indeed, of golden treasure thou'rt a mine, Thy manners greatly with my heart agree. I love thy sweet acquaintance from my heart; Will make a bargain with thee not to part, Till fate shall strike our system off its hinges: Consenting to a little gout sometimes; That spoils my appetite to meat and rhimes, Those very sharp memento-mori twinges. I thank thee that thou brought'st me into being; The things of this our world are well worth seeing, And, let me add moreover, well worth feeling; Then what the dev'l would people have, These gloomy hunters of the grave, For ever sighing, groaning, canting, kneeling? I cannot rise from thee as from a feast, As Horace says, uti conviva satur— No such matter: I'll answer for myself at least. No, when it comes that thou and I must part, Life, I shall leave thee with a sighing heart; Leave the warm precincts of the cheerful day, With ling'ring longing looks, says Gray. Some wish they never had been born, how odd! To see the handy works of God, In sun, and moon, and starry sky; Though last, not least, to see sweet woman's charms; Nay more, to clasp them in our arms, And pour the soul in love's delicious sigh, Is well worth coming for, I'm sure, Supposing that thou gav'st us nothing more. Yet, thus surrounded, Life, dear Life, I'm thine; And could I always call thee mine, I would not quickly bid this world farewell: But whether here, or long, or short my stay, I'll keep in mind, for ev'ry day, An old French motto, vive la bagatelle! Before us Heav'n hath plac'd the tear and smile; Each may be won with very trifling toil— But if there be in Nature such a mule, Who, willing with misfortune to be curst, Should, like an idiot, madly choose the first, In God's name let him suffer like a fool. Misfortunes are this lott'ry world's sad blanks; Presents, in my opinion, not worth thanks: The pleasures are the twenty-thousand prizes, Which nothing but a downright ass despises. ODE TO ADMIRAL HOTHAM. Thrice happy man, on whom Dundas and Pitt, With all the energy of human wit, And all the pow'rs of sacred truth beside, Have lavish'd the wild torrent of their praise, Deck'd thy bald head with Glory's brightest rays! Haste from thy vessel with unwounded hide; Thy vessel, which, like thee, 'mid war's alarm, And mighty danger, met no mighty harm. Great tar, at once thy course for England shape; England, broad staring, quite upon the gape, To meet the victor, by whose arm, Dundas Declares what marv'lous things have come to pass! Yet as we bear thee through the streets along, Amid the stunning shout, and howling song; Suppose a patriot sage should cross thy way, And, claiming silence, ask in manly tone, ‘What for these honours, Hotham, hast thou done?’ Hotham! now what the devil wilt thou say? TO THE BUTTERFLY.FROM THE PERSIAN OF EMIR JOHAD. Sweet child of summer, who from flow'r to flow'r, To sip each odour, sport'st on silken wing; I greet thy presence 'mid the golden hour, Whilst with the birds the vales of Serdi ring. I see thee perching on each rose's bloom; From fragrance thus to fragrance wont to glide; Now from the tender vi'let waft perfume; Now fix'd upon the lily's snowy pride. Though blest art thou—my bliss is greater still; I kiss the bosom of the brightest fair! The charms of Adel all my senses fill; And whilst those charms I press, her love I share. But thou a mutual passion canst not know; No fond endearments can return to thee— Whilst I, belov'd, with constant rapture glow— Sweet child of summer, come and envy me. ODE TO THE LION SHIP OF WAR. On her Return with the Embassy from China. Dear Lion, welcome from thy monkey trip; Glad is the bard to see thee, thou good ship; Thy mournful ensign, half way down the staff, Provokes (I fear me much) a general laugh! What sad long phizzes thou hast now on board! A high and mighty disappointed lord! And lo, a disappointed doughty knight, Whose buds of hope have felt a horrid blight. Say, wert thou not asham'd to put thy prow Where Britons, dog-like, learnt to crawl and bow? Where eastern majesty, as hist'ry sings, Looks down with smiles of scorn on western kings? Ah me! 'tis universally allow'd That eastern monarchs are prodigious proud; Unlike the humble monarchs of the west— Such kind and pliable and gentle creatures! So placid, of their souls, and sweet, the features; Where nought but Virtue is a welcome guest. Your eastern despots, in their lofty station, Expect the censer of rich adulation To burn for ever underneath their noses: This incense boasts a certain opiate pow'r; Whose pleasant, stupefying, plenteous show'r, The optics of the understanding closes; Producing, too, a charming gaudy dream, In which kings think they hold the world's esteem Think, too, the conscience sound, tho' full of holes, And virtues, thick as herrings, in their souls. O Flatt'ry, thou attendant on Inanity, Thou meat, drink, clothes, and furniture of Vanity, 'Tis cruel to attack a feeble head; Yes, cruel—likewise let me add, a shame— Who never makest mention of its name, Poor, easy, gaping cuckoo, when 'tis dead. Once more to thee, O Lion, to return— A subject form'd to bid all England mourn! O think upon thy Britons, how disgrac'd, As to the palace of Jehól they rac'd, So shabbily, so tawdrily array'd ‘I cannot but add to the obstacles which we received from the curiosity of the Chinese people, some small degree of mortification at the kind of impression our appearance seemed to make on them: for they no sooner obtained a sight of any of us, than they universally burst out into loud shouts of laughter.’ Vide Anderson's Narrative of the British Embassy to China.! The natives, with horse-laughs, the tribe remarking Mr. Anderson supposes the clothes for the suite of the ambassador were second-hand things purchased from the servants of the French Ambassador Luzerne, or from the play-houses—perhaps from Monmouth-street.; While, grunting, kicking, braying, howling, barking ‘We found ourselves (says Mr. Anderson) intermingled with a cohort of pigs, asses, and dogs, which broke our ranks, such as they were, and put us into irrecoverable confusion. All formality of procession, therefore, was at an end; and the ambassador's palanquin was so far advanced before us, as to make a little smart running necessary to overtake it.’, Hogs, dogs, and asses, join'd the cavalcade! Not Staunton, with his doctor's gown and cap, Could from the populace obtain one clap; Nor poor Macartney, with his star and ribbon!— Child-like, he might as well have had a bib on! Ah me! before ye sail'd, a friend, I told ye all how things would end See my Epistle to Lord Macartney, in which I prophesied somewhat more than came to pass, as the embassy was bonâ fide not literally flogged; but, says Anderson, ‘we entered Pekin like paupers, we remained in it like prisoners, and we quitted it like vagrants.’. Tell me, who plann'd this silly expedition? That brain was surely in a mad condition: Say, was it Avarice, the lean old jade, Who, though half Asia's gems her corpse illume (Sol's radiance on a melancholy tomb), Can join with Meanness in her dirtiest trade? Who told our king, the embassy would thrive, Must be the most egregious fool alive— God mend that courtier's head, or rather trash-pot!— Perhaps he cry'd, ‘Upon the rich Hindoo Your glorious majesty has cast its shoe, And China next, my liege, must be your wash-pot.’ ODE TO A BUTTERFLY. Child of the summer's golden hour, Who, happy, rov'st from flow'r to flow'r, Now sportive winnowing 'mid th' expanse of air; O welcome to my little field! Each leaf of fragrance may it yield! Yes, dwell with me, and Nature's bounty share. No black Sir Joseph Banks. with his net, And Jonas Jonas Dryander, the knight's sine quo non., whelm'd with dust and sweat, Shall rudely chase thee far from my protection; Wild-leaping ev'ry fence and ditch; So rank the virtuoso itch, For making a rare butterfly collection. Yet round thy paper-gibbet, laud would flow, Amid the knight's brave breakfasts in Soho; With rapture shown to toast-and-muffin sages: With thee too, would the royal Journals ring; And ev'n thy pretty mealy painted wing Employ description sweet, for fifty pages! Yet what, alas! is praise to people dead? A panegyric on a lump of lead— Precisely so! Ye gods, then, let me all my praises hear— For verily 'tis wisdom to prefer One grain above ground, to a pound below. Rare child of ether, pr'ythee then agree To choose the offer'd field, and dwell with me: Here will I mark thee, 'mid thy meals, how chaste! So busy on the flow'rs of golden hue, And silver daisies moist with morning dew, How innocent, how simple thy repast! Ah! diff'rent far, from us who grossly lave Our lips in beef and mutton's sanguine wave! Whilst we, a race barbarian, cruel, slay— From hog, too, form the dinners of the day— From hog, that lodg'd of yore the imps of evil The history of the herd of swine is universally known as well as believed.! Intrepid he who ventur'd thus to dine! Methinks the man who dreamt of eating swine, Must really next have thought of eating devil. ODE ON MODERATION. ‘Some folks are mad, and do not know it,’ Says some one—I forget the poet; And verily the bard was in the right. Wild as a puppy chasing butterflies, The world hunts Transport with keen nose and eyes: Deceitful lass, who often proves a bite! The calm, cool, philosophic hour; The purling brook, the woodbine bow'r; The grove's, the valley's sweet and simple song; Morn's virgin blush, and Evening's setting ray, On more than half the world are thrown away, Whose joys must like a whirlwind pour along. Calmly let me begin and end Life's chapter; Ne'er panting for a hurricane of rapture: Calm let me walk—not riotous and jumping: With due decorum, let my heart Perform a sober, quiet part, Not at the ribs be ever bumping, bumping. Rapture's a charger—often breaks his girt, Runs off, and flings his rider in the dirt. Lo, when for Gretna Green the couple start, Love plays his gambols thro' each throbbing heart: Squeezing and hugging, kissing on they go; Wild, from the chaise, they poke their heads to John, ‘Make haste, dear John, drive on, drive on, drive on, Lord! Lord! your horses are so very slow!’ And whilst, for Gretna Green, each turtle sighs, The blacksmith Also a divine, who gains a comfortable maintenance by making matrimonial chains as well as horse-shoes. seems an angel in their eyes. But when this blacksmith has perform'd his part, Possession quells the tumults of the heart; The heart with foaming bliss no more boils over! Now leisurely into the chaise they get! They ask no John to drive, no horse to sweat; No eye's keen sparkle shows the burning lover; No kisses 'midst the jolting road they snap; Cælia now takes a comfortable nap: Down on her cheeks, her locks dishevell'd flow; Not vastly smooth, but much like locks of hay; Her cap not much resembling Alpine snow, Shook from her rolling wearied head away. The youth too, with his noddle on his breast; His hair all careless, much in hay-like trim; As though sweet wedlock's joys had lost their zest; As though a dull indiff'rence damn'd the whim; With mouth half shut, that heavy seems to say, ‘The Devil take the blacksmith and the day, Who tied me to that trollop, now my wife, Just like a jack-ass to a post, for life!’ THE SONG OF DISAPPOINTMENT: AN ELEGIAC BALLAD. Hope whisper'd fine things in my ear; I believ'd her, though trick is her trade; She told me that Fortune was near, Who had always behav'd like a jade. Great names, little people astound— How 'witching the title, your Grace!— My Lord Duke, Lady Duchess, what sound! Big with honour, and dinner, and place. In fancy I join'd the duke's table, Where his Grace so instructively chats; Despising my garret, that stable, My joint-stool, and my penn'orth of sprats. In fancy I jok'd with his Grace, And felt a huge torrent of bliss— Then I flatter'd the duchess's face, And whisper'd love-stories to Miss Miss Anguish.. In fancy his Grace I beheld, Heard his mouth with sound criticism ope; That mouth most deliciously swell'd With quotations from Dryden and Pope. In fancy I heard him aloud Read his prologue so sweet to his guests; Saw wonderment stare from the crowd, And rapture burst wild from their breasts. Now I heard him delightfully thrum; Now in praise of old music a raver; Now Handel's huge choruses hum; Now a critic on crotchet and quaver. In fancy a bonfire I blaz'd; At my wit heard them call out ‘encore;’ While the room with astonishment gaz'd, Prepar'd ev'ry moment to roar. But the duke has secreted his face; To the bard what a terrible blow? And gone are the smiles of her grace, And the smiles of each Anguish al-so. But I'm not deluded alone; To another he sadly behav'd: Doctor Jackson, by promises won, Cut his curls from his pate, and was shav'd. Though the doctor look'd smart with his locks, Sublime too, and swarthy, and big; He was told, when a bishop, his flocks Would expect a full bushel of wig. A wig was accordingly bought, As a cauliflow'r large, and as fair; Where the barber too, blest with good thought, Wove religion and pomp in each hair. In short, 'twas so solemn a quiz, So form'd for concerns of the soul; People scarce could decide on its phiz, Which look'd wisest, the caxon or jowl. But after this grand operation Of clipping and wigging, I trow, Sore balk'd was poor Con's Con, i. e. Consequential Jackson—a constant appellative bestowed on him at the University of Oxford. exaltation, But why—none with certainty know. Some thought Heav'n with the wig was displeas'd; But people may think as they list: Others said (with maliciousness seiz'd) Heav'n hated the pride of the priest. So the doctor no bishop was made, Nor at present a bishop is he; And it also may safely be said, That a bishop he never will be. But the duke too is thwarted I ween; Who looks up like a hawk to the crown; But, alas! our good king and good queen Have never vouchsaf'd to look down. Now to duke and to duchess adieu; Adieu to my honours like-wise; The vision departs from my view, And Hope, the false flatterer, flies. My teeth too are robb'd of sweet picking; Ah teeth, to good eating attach'd! And thus have I counted my chicken, Poor blockhead, before they were hatch'd. THE ROYAL VISIT TO EXETER; A POETICAL EPISTLE, BY JOHN PLOUGHSHARE, A Farmer of Morton Hampstead, in the County of Devon. Well! in a come—King George to town, With doust and zweat az nutmeg brown, The hosses all in smoke; Huzzain, trumpetin, and dringin, Red colours vleein, roarin, zingin; Zo mad simm'd all the voke. PART I. I promis'd thee, dear Zester Nan, That thee shudst hear vrom Brether Jan, About the king wey speed: And now I zet me down to write, To tell thee every thing outright, The whole that I've azeed. Now meend me, Nan! all Exter town Was gapin, rennin up and down, Vath, just leek vokes bewitch'd! Lord! how they lang'd to zee the king; To hear un zay zom marv'lous thing! Leek mangy dogs they itch'd! Leek bullocks sting'd by appledranes, Currantin it about the lanes, Vokes theese way dreav'd and that; Zom hootin, heavin, soalin, hawlin; Zom in the mucks, and pellum sprawlin; Leek pancakes all zo flat. Hosses and mares, assnegers, moyles, Leaping the hedges, ditches, stiles, Hunderds comm'd in at least; Gallopin, trattin, spurrin, vallin, Hallooin, laughin, cryin, squawlin, Vour mounted 'pon one beast. The ladies from the windors all Pok'd vorth their powls, both gert and small; Ecod, there were a power: Their hair zo white I'd zexpence stake, That vrom their powls I'd fairly shake A dezen zacks o' vlower. To spoil good vlower a spendthrift crew! Ould Time wull whitten vast anew, The locks o'um, never fear; Bezides, it is a burnin shame, And making of God's gifts a game, Considerin corn's so dear. And yet the perty maids, I vow, Make me vorgive, I can't tell how, Thoft 'tis a serious matter: But what wey zich have I to do? Vor Joan and Nell, and Madge and Sue, My mouthe must only water. But than agan, Iss can't but zay, Iss could look at mun a whole day, They look'd so vair and vresh; Iss long'd to gee zome hearty smacks Upon their little rosy chacks, They seem'd zech wholsome vlesh. Well! in a come—King George to town, With doust and zweat az nutmeg brown, The hosses all in smoke; Huzzain, trumpetin, and dringin, Red colours vleeing, roarin, zingin; So mad seem'd all the voke. Wipin his zweatty jaws and poull, All over doust we spy'd 'Squire Rolle, Close by the king's coach trattin: Now shovin in the coach his head, Meaning, we giss'd, it might be zed, ‘The 'squire and king be chattin.’ Now goed the aldermen and may'r Mr. Burnet., Zum wey crapp'd wigs, and zum wey hair, The royal voke to ken; When Measter May'r, upon my word, Pok'd to the king a gert long sword, Which he pok'd back agen. Now thoose that round Ould Burnet stood, All zwear'd it clumzily was dood; Yet Squirt, the peepel zay, Brandish'd his gert horse-glysterpipe, To make un in his lesson ripe, That took up half a day. Now down long Vorestreet did they come, Zum hollowin, and screechin zum; Now tridg'd they to the dean's, Becaze the bishop zent mun word, A could not meat and drink avoord, A hadn't got the means. A zaid, ‘that az vor he, poor man, A had not got a pot nor pan, Nor spoon, nor knive, nor vork; That he was weak, and ould, and squeal, And zeldom made a hearty meal, And zeldom draed a cork.’ Indeed a was a moderate man, And zo war all the clargy clan That with un uz'd to chatter; Who if a ax'd mun to drink wine To one the wother they tipp'd the sign, And begg'd his charming water. ‘And as vor rooms, why there agen, A could not lodge a cock nor hen, They war so small,’ he said; ‘And as vor beds they wudn't do— In number about one or two, Vor zelf and Joan the maid. ‘In voolish things a wudn't be cort; 'Twas stoopid to treat vokes for nort; No, 'twas not his desire: Prefarment, too, was at an end; The king wud never more vor'n zend, To lift'n one peg higher.’ And yet they zay's a man of sense, Honest and just, but hoardth his pence— Can't peart wey drink nor meat: And then, ‘what vor?’ the peeple rail, ‘To greaze a vat old pig in the tail; Old Weymouth of Longleat!’ Well! to the dean's, bounce in they went, And all the day in munchin spent, And guzlin too, no doubt: And while the gentry drink'd within, The mob wey brandy, ale, and gin, Got roarin drunk without. PART II. Now Vriday morning sheen'd zo bright: But zome were up bevore 'twas light; Wey zounds the streets did ring: ‘Lord, Lord, than sose, were yow zo blest, To zee the show among the rest? Did you than zee the king?’ Now droo a small back-door His majesty did not, as was expected, enter in full procession the large door of the Abbey; but slipped into a small private one, to the no small mortification of Messieurs Mayor, Alderman, and Cavalcade. wey stairs, King George went vorth to zay his pray'rs; A pure and godly sign: And there he took his spyeglass out, Star'd up and down, and all about, And simm'd to zay, ‘Tis vine.’ Vull az an egg was all the church, Vor voakes were mad as hares in March And fath it was dam quare, To zee ould dames wey leathern chacks, Hoisted upon the fellows' backs— A penny for a stare. The queen, she show'd zuch wive-leek care Zo kind upon un zo to stare; To whisper'n, and all that! And faggins, people leek'd it much, Zo pleas'd to zee her love vor'n zuch— To watch'n leek a cat. Prayers over, now he spy'd the ruff, And look'd it round and round anuff, And zoon beginn'd to speak: Zo zaid, ‘Neat, neat—clean, very clean; D'ye mop it, mop it This observation really took place at Exeter, as well as at Salisbury, some years since., Measter Dean— Mop, mop it every week?’ ‘Sir,’ zaid Dean Buller to'n agen, ‘'Tis not by moppin keep'd zo clean, What streek'th your royal eye? Vor, zir, in all our Exter shops, We never meet wey zich long mops; Our mops dant reach zo high. All people join to praise the dean, He did zo well his zel demean; No man behav'd more humbler: Spar'd no expense—bort ev'ry thing— To please forseth the queen and king; Vor which, they gid'n a tumbler. Vor royal voake, so gert withall, The present simm'd most merty small: And zo zed all the city: It was too sneaken, fath and troth— A poor groat glass between mun both! No fath! it waz'nt vitty. Now to the tavern renn'd 'Squire Rolle, To git the names of every zoul That wish'd King George to zee To be presented.: The 'squire most kindly told mun too, How jest leek soldiers they must do— Bow down, and drap the knee. And zaid it never shud be miss'd; That when King George's hand they kiss'd, Leek vish they must be dum! And backwards crawl leek crabs away: Good zound advice—much as to zay, ‘Kings must not zee your b?m.’ Now tridg'd to aldermen and may'r, 'Squire Rolle, a speech vor to prepare, To thank the king vor commin: ‘Lord!’ cry'd the aldermen and may'r, ‘Why, Measter Rolle, yow make us stare! 'Squire Rolle, why yow be hummin! ‘Why we be only men in trade; 'Tis true a vieow good pounds we've made— Be tolerably rich: But thoff we've rak'd up zom vieow pence, It deth not vollow we've the sence To make the king a speech. ‘Zend vor rekoreder—put he too't— We'll warrant Hawtry zoon wull doo't— Iss, iss, he'll do the feat: And as the man can logic chop, The doul's in't if he can't cook up Zomethin that's short and zweet.’ Now Hawtry took a world o' pain— He did zo drash about his brain, That was not over stor'd; But vath, outleap'd a speech at laste, That simm'd to please King George's taste, Speal'd right in ev'ry word. Now to the rume, to zee the king, They all march'd off, a clever dring; And there King George a stude, Receiving bows and scrapes and kisses, Vor all the world leek handsome Misses, Expecting to be woo'd. Jolly's a tinker stude 'Squire Rolle, Sly winking, leek an ould grey owl, To zee that nort went wrong; Zo got behend, and wey a frown He pull'd near twenty o'mun down, And twenty droad along. The king stude patient az a stock, Vour hours at least by Exter clock, It zafely might be waager'd; Zom makin their vine rev'rence spurn'd, The king was nearly overturn'd, A Gosh! a was so badger'd. Tagrag and bobtail, all kiss'd hands, Vrom neighb'ring pearts and voreign lands; Aye! kissing 'twas anuff— Had not the hand been tight put on, It was zo mainly smack'd upon, The voke had kiss'd it off. And fath, no woundy fuss was made 'Bout dress amungst the men in trade, They thort o' no zich thing; Wey derty sharts and grizly beards, Much leek a greazy pack o' keards, They shuffled vore the king. Now Varmer Tab, I understand, Drode his legs vore, and catch'd the hand, And shak'd wey might and main: ‘I'm glad your majesty to zee, And hope your majesty,’ quoth he, ‘Wull nere be maz'd again.’ ‘Maz'd! maz'd! what's maz'd?’ then zed the king; ‘I never heer'd of zich a thing; What's maz'd?—what, what, my lord?’ ‘Hem,’ zed my lord, and blow'd his nose; ‘Hem, hem—sir, 'tis, I do suppose, Sir,—an old Dev'nshire word.’ And than my lord a scratch'd his head, And, coughing ance or twiss, he zed: ‘I'll try to vend it out;’ And then agen he hemm'd and haad, And puzlin while his pate a claw'd King George a tern'd about. PART III. Zom thort the king wud march about, And show his zelf a bit, no doubt; Zee Guildhall, Circus, Castle: Vor this, Lord Fosky gid'n a shove; But virm's a rock, nort mad'n move, Zo 'twas in vain to wrastle. But this a did—now this was kind— Knowin the people's longing mind, And being pretty tall, A stude 'pon's tiptoes, it is zed; And, condescending, pok'd his head Over the bishop's wall. Zum of the Exter voke suppose They plainly zeed his royal nose, And zum his royal eyes; And, Lord, whatever peart they zeed, In this, they one and all agreed, 'Twas glorious, gert, and wize. 'Tis zed, and I believe 'tis true, He gid (but lookin rether blue) The Hospital a ken: 'Twas all a gid; but than quoth he, ‘I'll zomething gee, my lord, d'ye zee, When I come here agen.’ This, to be zure, look'd cruel kind Towards the zick, and lame, and blind; What's thy opinion, Nan? But rat it, theve net zeed a doit; Zo 'tes no very gert exploit Of our Samaritan. Zich perty promises, egosh! Zeem words o' cuse—a pack o' trosh; Wind, faith! net one crume better; I leek to zee voakes dra the puss; Parlaver is not worth a cuss; I hate to hear voakes chetter. But now to please the royal chops, Presents vall'd in as thick as hops, Vish, vlesh, and vowl, and vruit; 'Twas who shud zay, ‘I sent the king Zich, zich, and zich, and zich a thing:’ The vokes were mad to do't. Now let me tell thee, Zester Nan, The king's a jolley gentleman, The queen not very ugly! Az vor the princesses, sweet souls, With rosy chucks, and flaxen polls, They angels look'd so smugly. Mayhap, yow wud be glad to know Zom more about the queen, I trow— I think I've zed anuff; What voakes in general zay is this: ‘The oman is not much amiss, And tak'th a power o' snuff.’ But milliners of Exter zwear, That her's and all her daughters' geer Was shellings net worth thirty; That, Lord! they wear'd but little laces, Their zilks mert blish to show their faces, Ould-fashion'd, strip'd, and dirty. Now woundy mad was Measter Mare Burnet, the plumber., To think a should a veast prepare, Of vlesh, and vowl, and vish; Of ham, and terkie, gooze, and mustard, Dumplin, and apple-pie, and custard, As good az mouthe could wish. Vor whan unto King George a zends, To tell'n the aldermen, his vriends, Wud all be glad to ze'en; The king no notice tuke, 'tis zaid, But, leek a pisky, laugh'd and play'd To push pin wey the queen. Zo there the meal, vorzooth, was spoil'd, The bak'd and roast, and vry'd and boil'd; Oh! 'twas a dismal day; The zyder, brandy, wine and ale, The gert gold chair Made expressly, at a very great expense: Indeed it did credit to the liberality of the corporation. to hold his tail, Was money droad away. It, when King George did leave the town, The aldermen, in red fur gown, And Mare, vore Guildhall houze, Vurst havin had a little veeding, Leek soldiers form'd to show their breeding, And make their Zenday bows. The king, he spy'd mun vrom his coach, Wey faces net pleaz'd over much, That did un much delight; The bench keep'd bowin up and down, Till all the hosses rumps they vound, And king's were out o' zight. Than home they lerk'd, and drapt their furs And tails between their legs, leek curs, Becaze they war zo zlighted; But what was ten times worse, poor souls, Their wives leek devils claw'd their polls, Becaze they didn't get knighted. POSTSCRIPT. NOW, Zester Nan, by this yow zee, What zort of vokes gert people be: What's cheny thoft, is clome; And, zester, now I do believe, That after this yow daan't much grieve, Becaze yow staid at home. Theeze once I've made myzelf a vool, And now I veel my courage cool For zeeing royal things: And whan my Bible next I rede, Zo leet I worship all the breed, I'll skep the book of Kings. OUT AT LAST. OR, THE FALLEN MINISTER. ? Procumbit humi bos. VIRGIL. ‘He's down! amid Saint Stephen's walls, The mighty beast in thunder falls.’ PROEMIUM. Some time ago the Lyric Peter, With much sublimity of metre, Did prophesy a minister would tumble! To verify the poet's ode, Behold it pleaseth man and God, In anger, his high mightiness to humble! Good man! but not the Man of Ross; He's down! procumbit humi bos. How like unto a crow, or rook, Shot near his nest (a mortal wound), He hung and bled, with downcast look, Before he sous'd at last to ground! Yes! like those black birds much too long we saw The culprit hanging by a single claw. What a vile bramble he has been, May now with half an eye be seen.— Look at us!—What poor shiv'ring sheep, alack Naked and lank—most closely shorn! This hooking, dragging imp has torn The healthful, warming fleece from every back! Gone! gone some good-for-nothing ribs to treat; But woe to that poor sheep which dar'd to bleat! Sing, heavenly muse, to whom our wool all goes:— To warm Dundas, Long, Wyndham, Canning, Rose, Old Liverpool and cub, with each compeer.— While they carousing swill'd their toast and sack, We bit, in anguish, musty bread and black, And writhing got the gripes from dead small-beer. ‘Try Pitt again,’ some fools exclaim. He has been tried, and tried, and tried— The hobbling nation, still more lame, Has now nor crutch, nor ass to ride. ‘He'll mend,’ they roar.—He mend! the mumer— Aye, mend just like sour ale in mummer. Lo, then, our sad state-carpenter dismiss'd! No longer now his bungling art befools: Yet from the service when the man was hiss'd, Why leave behind his budget and his tools? Glad as a bird that 'scapes the kite, I'll drop The lamentations of poor Jeremiah; Of gay Pindarics open a fresh shop, And pour the song of triumph with Isaiah. READER, in this my lyric ode, I imitate a man of God; That Poet of sublimity, Isaiah! A man of quality, of note; Of arms possessing a rich coat; A brother to the great King Azariah. Lord! how the poet did bespatter The Babylonian monarch with his satire! Were I to talk so of a British king, What were my fate? Alas! a string! Not string, dear reader, that the shoulder decks; But string that twines at Newgate round our necks. ODE OF TRIUMPH. Tossing poor Englishmen in scorn, The bull no more exalts his horn! Thank God, the beast is put at last to pound! And that he never may get out, To make another cursed rout, Forms many a hearty pray'r and wish profound. What! is there not one song of sorrow, One tear of pity?—Let me say, There's neither dirge nor tear to-day, Whatever there may be to-morrow. Nay, cannons roar applause—the bells are ringing And earth, rejoicing, breaketh into singing. No more he turns the burning globe; But on a dunghill, just like Job, Scratching, surveys his melancholy plight! No more with Hal, his chum, to booze, And for the state's salvation snooze, He bids the clarets and champaigns good night. But hark! Old England's genius sings! (Sounds that will pierce the ears of kings) ‘Harpoon'd art thou at last, thou flound'ring porpoise— Thou who hast swallow'd all my rights, Gobbling the mightiest just like mites— Devouring like a sprat my habeas corpus. ‘Thou, who didst bind my sons in chains, And nearly beatedst out their brains, For fear their wrath might kindle riot; And, after binding them in chains, And nearly beating out their brains, Didst cry—‘How tame they lie, poor things! how quiet!’ ‘Thou who didst groaning prisoners keep In Cold-bath Fields, like hapless sheep Whom horrid butchers mean to slay; Where Aris with his iron rod, The Pluto of the dark abode, Roasted and broil'd in cook-like way, The victims of his pow'r and pride, And damn'd them all before they died. ‘Art thou the caitiff, with imperious frown, Who o'er the bard didst hold thy hempen string; Threat'ning to hang him, if, to please the town, He dar'd to smile or wink at q? or k?; Or dar'd (no matter how divine the songs) To chant of Dumplings, Sheep, or Parson Youngs; To mention kine and corn, and Famine's groans; Record wit royal, and crack jokes on thrones?’ Bold hast thou said, ‘Supreme I'll prate— ‘I will be minister of state, And swill from night to morn the nation's wine: I will get drunk with honest Hal: The bottle my dear constant Baal, I'll daily kneel and hiccup at his shrine. ‘Snoring upon the state-machine My drowsy brother shall be seen, Who from his cradle never heard the lark. I grant the man the wheels will clog, Lazy as Ludlam's lazy dog, That held his head against the wall to bark. ‘His nose may like the bull-frog roar— The state shall pay him for the snore. ‘I'll buffet Opposition's waves: I have my creatures and my slaves: For any borough will I bring my man in: The poorest wretch that crawls I'll raise, To yield his incense-pot of praise, From Greek-mouth'd Belgrave to lame-Latin Canning This gentleman was ravished from his opposition-friends on account of supposed extraordinary talents. A completer take-in of the knowing-ones was never more laughably experienced amonst the black-legs of the turf. His ‘Iter ad Meccam,’ for the university prize, exhibited such proofs of ideas and scholarship as put the poor dean of Christ-Church to the blush. The first effort was condemned to the flames, though it obtained the prize: the second was a cobbled piece of work between Mr. Canning and somebody of Christ-Church, which with difficulty passed muster.. ‘I'll pension any fool or knave; The nation's pocket my poor slave, Shall open, nor dare make a pother— Gifford, that crooked babe of grace, And Canning too, shall be in place, And get a pension for his mother. ‘Ev'n Gr?v?r's cobbler This is a most extraordinary fellow, speculatively virtuous, and practically wicked—for ever bellowing in the cause of religion and morals, yet in the daily practice of every thing that should fix him at the cart's-tail.—To justify the above assertions, accept, reader, a small sketch of his life, and blush for the depravity of human nature! Taken from a cobbler's stall at Ashburton, a little town in Devonshire, by Mr. Cookesly, a surgeon of that place, who mistook the itch of rhime for the inspiration of the muses, he was, by a subscription of the gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood, placed at a grammar school, and afterwards sent to Exeter College.—At this college, after his daily occupations of tolling the bell, waiting at dinner, and lighting the candles, he amused himself with writing scandalous lampoons on the heads of the college, as well as other respectable characters of the university.—Noticed, however, by a clergyman, he was introduced to Earl G. who soon found an honourable employment for him, luckily for his lordship's pleasures, and fortunately congenial to the disposition of Gifford.—In a little time he tripped up the heels of his Oxford friend, ousted him from the house of G? by lying insinuations, and publicly triumphed in his success.—His next glorious action was to send a cast-off strumpet of his l?ds?hp to the widow of his old friend Cookesly, who, for a livelihood, kept a creditable boarding-school.—She was recommended by Gifford as a modest young lady, for education, which modest young lady, in a few months, betrayed her old Cyprian propensities, and very expeditiously blasted the school: this was the subject of another triumph. To continue his progress in infamy with an equal splendour, he seduced a beautiful and innocent girl, called Mary Weeks, a native of Ashburton. Under the pretence of marrying her, a fellow with a surplice was prepared to execute this nefarious matter; the sham ceremony was performed, the poor girl was ruined; and after satiety had taken place with her infamous seducer, she was sent back to Ashburton, where she pined and died of a broken heart!!! To support the credit of his past achievements, he published a most dirty and scandalous poem, called ‘The Ashburtonaid,’ abusing all his old and respectable benefactors. Previously to the above act, he had obtained an ample subscription for a Translation of the Satires of Juvenal, which (happily for the public, and paper, and print) he never performed.—To accommodate his Mæcenas, he keeps a creature as a decoy-duck, and has actually sent her to necessitous young women of beauty and innocence, under the pretext of learning to read and write.—Such are parts of his life—Hunc tu Romane, caveto, hic niger est.—It must not, however, be forgotten, that, for his atrocious calumnies, he was lately cudgelled in one Wright's shop, a poor ignorant and painstaking bookseller in Piccadilly; and, in spite of the most solemn and tender protestations of his own head and shoulders, he with an unprecedented effrontery denied the fact; and, notwithstanding a message, informing him that he was cudgelled, most soundly cudgelled, and that he should be cudgelled again in order to oblige him, by producing a complete conviction, he had not the manners to answer the civility. He continues in his favourite occupation of administering as jackall to the constantly watering chops of the toothless old lion. To use another figure, he is still his lordship's gamekeeper, and guards the plump little partridges (which are exceedingly numerous on all his lordship's manors) with so much laudable assiduity from poachers, that he has been amply and gratefully remunerated with an honourable annuity from government!!! As for Mr. Gifford's rhimes, they will appears extraordinary to such readers (and they are not a few) as prefer bombast to sublimity. Bombast is the idol of the vulgar—To such, the Attic simplicity appears arrant insipidity—the vulgar eye is sooner fascinated by the stiff, staring cabbage-rose brocade of the harlot, than the modest and snowy robe of innocence. The ear of the true critic distinguishes with facility the difference between the mellifluous tones of the lyre of Apollo and the hard, ponderous sounds of the hammered lap-stone. To indulge a Greek quotation from Proclus on Plato, without offence to his pupil, the learned Lord Belgrave, Mr. William Gifford is—??????? ?? ??????????, ????????? ?? ?? ????????—which I translate thus: ‘He is a poet with poetasters, and a poetaster with poets.’ So much inequality pervades his verse, that the faculty would pronounce his muse afflicted with the rickets. Still to do him every justice, his various verses are very well for a cobbler; they must undoubtedly smell of the stall. Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa diu ? So singeth Horace, who, one would think, had peeped into futurity, aad penned the happy line for poor Crispin. So far from originalty of thought and a luxuriance of imagery in his lines, there reigns a pitiable famine: awkward and obscure inversions, with a verbose pomposity, form the leading features of almost every couplet. Indeed, it were cruel to expect more. Sprung from a dunghill, and old before he was charitably taken from his stall, at the same time totally destitute of the poetical character, what could a few scraps of Latin and Greek do for an object whose sole powers lay within the circumscribed space of a rhime? A riddle in the Lady's Diary—an acrostic in a newspaper—an abusive stanza in the Anti-Jacobin Review, or a criticism in the British Critic (equal, perhaps, to those of poor paralytic Parson Nares, a most feeble pillar of that falling fabric, and lately sent for a maintenance to that idle and expensive toyshop of the nation, called the British Museum)— form at present his amusement. At the house of Gr?v?r he experiences a prodigality of praise. But his lordship and his ladies are better qualified for writing the history of Paphos than Parnassus. On the appearance of this gentleman's last lying publication, which was in some measure answered by the argumentum baculinum, I entertained thoughts of a formal execution of the felon, in a solemn poetical epistle; but, on reflection, thinking him beneath the dignity of such an exhibition, I determined to hang him in a note. For, should the muse's satire bid him die, The goddess really guillotines a fly. Before I conclude, it may not be unacceptable to my readers to be informed that his I?dsh?p sometimes kills his own mutton—hunts without his jackall—and succeeds. Witness the following little genuine epistle: ‘DEAR G?, ‘I am in luck to-day—sprung a fine covey among a parcel of brambles. Take care of the plump little bird that bears this letter—clean her and comb her well, cut her nails close, and put her to bed. ‘G?,’ shall come forth, And hammer to the world my worth— Come hobbling forth without one blush of shame, With heeltaps, toe-caps, soles for worn-out fame.’ I'll hire each prostituted muse, For mags, for newspapers, reviews; I'll pay the ballad-singer's throat for praise: My visage (hatchet-like, indeed!) In shops the gaping mob shall feed— My name on rails shall grace the king's highways; And trav'llers, whether they may ride or walk, Read ‘Pitt for ever!’ in broad-staring chalk. ‘I'll place the Capets on the throne, And France her worthy kings shall own; And Bonaparte soon my rage shall feel; Crouch to my whip, whose lash shall bring The daring Corsican, poor thing, Just like a whining spaniel to my heel.’ Oft hast thou said, with scowling eye, ‘The world I hate, disdain, defy; I value neither commoner nor peer: He who attacks me, dearly pays: A man must have, the proverb says, Good iron nails that scratches with a bear.’ Art thou the man who bilk'd poor Paul, Who sent his bears, the dev'l and all, To fight in Britain's cause so hearty? Art thou the man (whom nothing shames), Who made his office clerks call names, And fling their dirt at Bonaparte? Bold hast thou said, with dauntless soul, ‘I'll damn the motion on Ferrol; No matter whether cowardice or not: Whatever was the crying sin, Sir James shall sleep in a whole skin— Hal says too, Pulteney must not go to pot. ‘The long-mock'd world may roar—“Where's shame?” Thank Heaven! we only know the name. ‘Safe are my minions,’ thou art pleas'd to say: ‘What ill they do, is quickly done away: Such (so secure is ev'ry culprit's lot) Must make strong int'rest to get hang'd or shot.’ Thou, in thine insolence, hast said, ‘At me the world shall cow'r afraid; Old Ganges humbly at my feet shall flow; Mogul, Nizam, and Rajah bend; Slave-like their humble tribute send, And learn from me their future fates to know. Those dare not call my hard decrees unjust, But kiss the foot that stamps them in the dust. ‘Ind shall her streams Pactolean pour; On petticoats her di'monds show'r, And stomachers and caps, the courtly things, Th' unchristian Turk his gems shall send— His trembling tottering turban rend, To grace the beaver'd brows of Christian kings. Peru shall gild St. James's walls and doors; And ravag'd Mexico emblaze the floors.’ Bold hast thou said—‘I'll curb the P? His bleeding mouth shall sorely wince; I value not his birth, his pride, his state: O'er Y?k triumphant too I'll tow'r; And Cl?ce shall not boast the pow'r To make a gunner, or a gunner's mate.’ Such of Britannia's Genius is the song! Now let the bard the theme pursue, And, with an equal spirit too, In thunder drive the muse's car along. POETA LOQUITUR. Bold hast thou sworn—‘The muse I'll check; Each, with a halter round her neck, Shall sing with trembling, trembling dread; Nay, should Apollo's song be sharp, And on my power and glory harp, Off goes at once the fellow's head: ‘I'll make a puddle of their streams, That give the bards their pretty dreams; And through the tuneful shades shall stray My jack-asses The Mathiases, the Giffords, the B?s, the C?s, &amp;c. &amp;c. Will it be credited that an administration so feeble should not have selected one tolerably literary pillar to support its imbecility? Where was Huntsman-Wyndham's judgment, when he made choice of hounds to run down opposition? Heavens bless us! Not one decent dog in the pack—neither nose nor speed—absolutely a parcel of yelping curs!, to graze and bray.’ Thou'rt an abominable branch: No more shalt thou enjoy a haunch— No more with Harry booze from night to morn— The hackneymen, to thy amaze, Shall cry, ‘My money for my chaise; The money, sir, to pay for hay and corn! Come, sir, I know what's what, and who is who; I'll trust no longer—d?mn me, if I do.’ See the stern shade of Chatham rise! On thee he darts his eagle eyes! ‘Fool!’ cries the angry disappointed ghost: ‘Was it for this I show'd thy youth The paths of glory, and fair truth? Lo, by thy flagrant solly, all is lost! Mad boy! instead of Wisdom's springs, to court The Dozing fountain of Dundas's port. ‘The wondrous column of my hand, That push'd its head into the skies; Shook by thy damned wizard wand, Low! low! a splendid ruin lies! Toads for a dwelling the poor pile invade, And shelter'd weeds of death, the fragment shade. Blush at the partners of thy toil, The refuse of the groaning isle!’ Where is the eagle that, above, Grasp'd daringly the bolts of Jove, And taught their fatal thunders where to roll? Ah! forc'd his lofty perch to quit, He dwindles to a poor tom-tit, And skulks through humble hedges to his hole. Is this the man who pension'd spies, Informers, that, with wolf-like eyes, Prowl'd nightly, yelling, in pursuit of food? Is this the man, who put, alack, Such bugs upon the nation's back, To gnaw and suck its best, its vital blood? Where are thy bustling levees now? Thy humble sycophants to bow, Obey thy mandate, and applaud thy wit? Unnotic'd thou shalt lonely ride, Attended only by thy pride, That never, never yet forsook a Pitt. Cur-like shalt thou walk in and out, Unnotic'd at her Grace's The jolly and hospitable Duchess of Gordon. rout! Unnotic'd, down thy throat, her pastry poke: No bumpkin, no poor country wight, Shall, stealing near with curious sight, Watch if thy jaw-bones wag like those of common folk! George Rose's papers shall turn tail— Expose thy blunders, storm and rail, And ope of Calumny the dirty springs; While Anti-Jacobin Reviews Shall cull the literary stews For flowers to deck the counsellor of kings. Each newspaper that took delight To make thee, like the snow-ball, white, Will paint thee now as black as Hell: No more thy voice angelic hail, But give the horn, and hoof, and tail, With Cerberus's frightful yell!— Paint thee a damned spirit from below, Rais'd by some wizard for the nation's woe. Lo! thou art sprawling in the dirt! The mob their wanton jokes will spirt!— Behold a sable chimney-sweep appear! And hark! a scavenger, with eyes Sparkling with rapture and surprise, Exclaims—‘Ah, Master Billy, are you there?’ Then, anxious to reward thee, on they rush, One with his broom, and t'other with his brush! Hark! authors braying round thee crowd, And authoresses cry aloud— ‘Villain! to wage a war with all the muses!’ And lo, the printer's devils appear! With ink thy visage they besmear, While each in turn indignantly abuses; And more their pris'ner to disgrace, They empt the pelt-pot An utensil among printers, containing a certain stale fluid for the benefit of the balls. in thy face! Roaring, around thee as they caper, ‘Take that, my boy, for tax on paper!’ And lo, with anger Hardy glows! The man of leather, with delight, Runneth his awl into thy nose, And stirrups thee with all his might. ‘He wants much mending, d?mn my eyes!’ The punning son of Crispin cries— ‘The shoe quite rotten—yes, the whole— Quite vanished ev'ry bit of sole.’ And, see! the girls around thee throng— ‘Art thou the wight, thus stretch'd along, An enemy well known to wives and misses? Art thou the man who dost not care For oglings, squeezes of the fair; Nay, makest up wry mouths at woman's kisses?’— Then shall the nymphs apply their birchen rods, And baste thee worse than Peter Pindar's Odes. And see poor Paddy with his pole! ‘By Jasus now, I'll twig his jowl, For leaving us poor Christians in the lurch: Open your jaw-bones, Master Knave— Where be the promises ye gave, To give a bit of shove to Mother Church? To a good market, faith! our hogs are brought— And so we're dead, and kill'd, and murder'd, all for naught!’ The cats shall spit at thee!—and, hark! The curs in yelling concert bark. The cats exclaim—‘Our mice with famine moan! Not one fat mouse is to be had!’ ‘Aye,’ cry the curs, ‘and what's more sad, We cannot now obtain a well-pick'd bone!’ O Furcifer—no, Lucifer I mean— How art thou fall'n from the starry sphere! Kick'd from the presence of the K. and Q.— From burgundy, from claret, to small beer! That feature of thy face call'd nose, Which now with many a ruby glows, Shall lose, alas! its wonted fire! The claret-lustre shall expire! For Poverty's pale fingers soon pick out The blushing rubies of the richest snout. The meanest of the mean shall scoff, And cry, ‘I'm glad the fellow's off!’ The tailor leaps in rapture from his board; The cobbler throws his shoe away; The washerwoman flings her tray; The shoeblack drops his brush, and thanks the Lord: To pot-houses they run with loud acclaim, To get more joyful news from Gossip Fame. Fox, on thy fall, with scorn must look; And pointed Sheridan and Tooke Will make thee tingle with the lash of wit: The poorest reptile of the House, The vilest little borough louse, Will scratch and bite the back of Billy Pitt. And he My very identical and numerical self, whose innocent and improving rhimes falling some years since in the way of an irritable and offended bashaw, gave birth to an act of parliament vowing vengeance on the wight that should, by any prose or poetical anatomy, dare exhibit the inside of heads royal., of whom the muses brag, From his stretch'd jaws shall pull the gag, And vengeful to thy head shall give it wing: Then shall he cry, with dauntless looks, ‘I'll go again amongst the cooks, And tell more pretty tales of q? and k?.’ LORD AUCKLAND'S TRIUMPH; OR, THE DEATH OF CRIM. CON. A PAIR OF PROPHETIC ODES. TO WHICH ARE ADDED, AN ADDRESS TO HYMEN.—AN ODE ON THE PASSIONS.—ADVICE TO YOUNG WOMEN; OR, THE ROSE AND STRAWBERRY, A FABLE.—WITH A MOST INTERESTING POSTSCRIPT. I heard a voice—‘Crim. Con., Crim. Con. Thou and thine empire are undone! Woe to the men of lawless lives, Who wink on other people's wives!’ ARGUMENT TO ODE I. The Bard, in the true Spirit of prophetic Poetry, commenceth his Ode with a compliment to Wedlock —Peter treateth the Hot-bed of Adultery with much poetical Contempt—He prophesieth the Fall of Crim. Con.; her Acquaintance with the Rakes—In a sublime Strain of Insult, Peter questioneth Crim. Con., and proclaimeth a total Annihilation of her Rams' Horns. Peter singeth of the wonders done by Rams' Horns at Jericho —he giveth some History of Lord Auckland's Family, and biddeth them beware of Difilement —The Poet candidly accuseth himself of having been a Votary to Pleasure, and prettily and poetically depicteth the manner of his courtship; illustrating with a most apt and—original comparison —The Poet abruptly bounceth off to attack the Princes of these Realms for not joining the pious Efforts of Lord Auckland, to destroy Crim. Con.—Peter complimenteth the Bench of Bishops for their furious Abhorrence of Crim. Con., for their intimate Knowledge of Heaven, and for their great Humility; but not for their great Poverty, in which Article these holy men have always varied from their simple Predecessors, the Apostles—Peter attacketh the Ladies' Petticoats, or rather no Petticoats—The Bard, with a mighty lyric Jump, leapeth on the Shoulders of King David, of Israel, and giveth him a stunning Blow; and suddenly turning about, knocketh down King Harry, of England; concluding with a Squint at some modern Princes—Peter praiseth the unparalleled, though ungallant, behaviour of a King Louis, of France, of whom he relateth an entertaining and delicate Story, ending with somewhat more than a Suspicion that certain young Gentlemen would not have shown the same Fortitude under the same Circumstances. ARGUMENT TO ODE II. An apologetic Song for Inconstancy, by a Son of the Devil—This Son of a Devil pronounceth Love and a Butterfly to be similar Beings, and encourageth the Idea—this Demon wisheth to take the licentious French Nation for a Model, who wish to change a Wife as often as a Shirt —this Imp continueth to fascinate the Mind by beautiful Poetry in Favour of the unlicensed Passion Love—Peter reprobateth such Notions, and prettily telleth, in Verse, a Story well known in Prose, of a King of France, who had experienced a Satiety on the Beauties of his Queen— Peter triumpheth in the future Happiness of the British Empire on the death of Crim. Con. —Peter exhibiteth a natural Picture of Age, exulting, amidst his Imbecilities, in the Idea of possessing blooming virgins, smiling at the same Time at the Horrors of Horns—Peter again, with his wonted Candour, reverseth the Medal, and suggesteth an Inconveniency that may arise from the State of Crim. Con. in the character of a rotten Rake—Peter here is truly moral, as well as poetical. Another Rake is brought on the Stage, who glorieth in the Advantages to be obtained over a Wife, by this Attack of Lord Auckland—Peter, replete with historical Knowledge, relateth a Story of the great Cato, and also of the wise Men, not of Gotham, but of Greece—The Bard again singeth the Song of Triumph—he prophesieth—He giveth a Picture of the fashionable Wives of the present day, who visit Tom's and John's, in Soho-Square, with as much Ease as Mrs. Snip the Milliner—Peter prophesieth Peace in the House of Wedlock, and Security to that blushful Damsel, Chastity— The impudent and threatening Speech of Miss Fornication on the intended destruction of her Sister Crim. Con. ODE I. Sweet is the song of wedded love, The echo of the turtle dove; Then who would turn that song to sounds of woe? Bright are the skies, and calm the scene Where Hymen holds his halcyon reign; Then who would bid the howling tempests blow? What but a ruffian would the spot invade, To dash the beam of bliss with hellish shade? Doubtless, Adultery's a fat hot-bed; But what's the produce?—Heaven's a wanton weed. No buds of promise ope their bloom, And load the zephyr with perfume! O Syren of the Cyprian Isle, Crim. Con. who by a touch and smile Dar'st lure a lady from a spouse's arms; Make her desert her babes, her kin, To listen to the voice of sin, That praiseth of Variety the charms; Thy lawless reign at length is o'er, And rams'-horns frighten man no more. Yes! there's an end of all thy wooing, Thy dove-like billing, fluttering, cooing: At thee, thy vile companions, ev'ry rake Shall start with horror, curse thy name, Fly from thy song of death with shame, Avoid thee like the fascinating snake That wily won the world's first madam, And put that fatal trick on Adam. Tell me, where are thy rams' horns now, To clap upon a husband's brow? Auckland has broken them to pieces: And thou shalt soon be put to death; Unpitied, yield thy forfeit breath, Except by wicked, wanton Misses, And wanton youths of our wild nation, Of prudence less possess'd than passion. By rams' horns Jericho fell down, A very notable old town; Yes, rams' horns laid the lovely city low: Thus rams' horns also to the earth Bring down the men of lofty birth, And force them with humility to bow. Look at Lord ??? whom high birth adorns, How pitiful he squints amidst his horns! Auckland, whose wife is charming and well bred, Auckland, ah! rather in the vale of years, Thinks gentlemen should have the proper fears, And try to ward the antlers from the head. Rare caution! how unlike some folk, Of present and past times the joke; Who, till the steed was stol'n, forbore What fools! to shut the stable door! Yes, Auckland has his wife and daughters too; And as our sex will never cease to woo, Their charms may fire some tinder-hearted man! A sigh, a tear, a gentle squeeze, A bed, a grot, a clump of trees, Have favour'd many a lover's artful plan. What though Lucretias? In a fatal hour, The fam'd Lucretia fell by Tarquin's pow'r. Auckland will give a deathful blow To some sad purlieus of Soho: No longer there shall lofty beds of down Expect the muffled married dame, And blushless youth of lawless flame, Secure from husbands and the prying town. There are, for wedded prey, who prowl, And joy to hear the tempest howl; O'er Matrimony's smile to cast a cloud, And put the modest lady in her shroud! Such shall the muse to infamy consign, And crush with all the thunders of her line. Blushing, I own, I've been in love with Pleasure, Look'd on the nymph's acquaintance as a treasure; Never pursued her once with scoff and hisses; But caught the little hussey in my arms; Ran o'er the pretty garden of her charms, And pluck'd the cherries of her lips—call'd kisses. I never cast off Pleasure from me—no; But hugg'd her, when I met with her—and so: For lo! a piece of velvet was my soul! Black velvet, mind! which when the god of day Doth visit with his all-enlivening ray, Enjoys the radiance, and devours the whole. Velvet, unlike the marble rock, indeed, Devoid of gratitude and grace; Who, when the sun would warm and gild his head, Flings back the blessing in his face. Yes! I was once a sinner, I confess, But now my morals wear a sober dress. Sorry am I for our good princes (Indeed my tender conscience winces), To think they try to save Crim. Con. the jade! The bishops in a goodly row, All wish to give a fatal blow: Such good examples somewhat might have sway'd! Rare oracles! so just, so sweet, so wise, So deep in all the secrets of the skies; So prone to teach, assist, inspire, and bless one, From which Humility might take a lesson! Sons of those holy men of yore— As pious but not quite so poor; Since Fortune, to the world's surprise, On Merit learns to ope her eyes. Now, when a bishop The present Bishop of London (Dr. Porteus) I must, indeed, adduce as an exception. Wishing to turn his back on his r?y?l patroness, on a vacancy in the see of Durham, he strained every nerve to obtain the precious prize, worth nearly twenty thousand pounds a-year; the bishopric of London, worth only poor four thousands per annum, scarcely sufficient to supply the extensive circle of his charities! Good man! he was disappointed; not only disappointed too; his prayer was considered as a piece of meanness and ingratitude.—If this be not a fact, I beg his lordship's pardon. for a favour sues, Not, not in vain the plaintive turtle coos. Ye Gods! how wicked are the times! Ev'n I cry, ‘Shame,’ the man of rhimes! And poets are not overstock'd with blushes.— See! lovely Modesty is gone From Britain, where she fix'd her throne, And Impudence to fill her station rushes! How loose our ladies in attire, To set our peeping youth on fire; A hundred instances I soon could pick ye! Without a cap we view the fair, The bosom heaving, heaving bare; The hips asham'd, forsooth to wear a dicky A term used in the polite circles for a flannel petticoat.: Quite antique statues—such the dress, It nothing leaves for Fancy's guess! Look at our grannums, good old souls, With caps and pinners, well mob'd polls; With warming dickies, high stiff stays, To guard the neck from grasp and gaze, How diff'rent from our modern fair, Whose ev'ry beauty takes the air! Alas! they heed no frost or snow, Nor winds around that chilling blow: And swing their muslin gossamer about; Showing what Modesty should veil; Things very proper to conceal, For legs and knees, and so, should ne'er peep out. Kind David set a very bad example— King Harry, too, a very shocking sample Of wedlock's constant, chaste, and lovely state: And many other kings besides, indeed, Too prone on wild variety to feed, Have broken Matrimony's tender pate: Nay, many princes ev'ry day Do something in this wicked way, But not so did a King of France, Whose story seemeth quite romance. A KING OF FRANCE AND THE FAIR LADY. At Battledore and Shuttlecock. A TRUE STORY. A King of France upon a day, With a fair lady of his court, Was pleas'd at battledore to play,— A very fashionable sport. Into the bosom of this fair court dame, Whose whiteness did the snow's pure whiteness shame, King Louis by an odd mischance did knock The shuttlecock, Thrice happy rogue, upon the down of doves, To nestle with the pretty little loves! ‘Now, sire, pray take it out’—quoth she. With an arch smile.—But what did he? What? what to charming Modesty belongs! Obedient to her soft command, He rais'd it—but not with his hand! No, marv'ling reader, but the chimney tongs. What a chaste thought in this good king! How clever! When shall we hear agen of such a thing? Lord! never. Now were our princes to be pray'd To such an act by some fair maid, I'll bet my life not one would mind it: But handy, without more ado, The youths would search the bosom through, Although it took a day to find it! ODE II. Now hear a son of Satan; how he sings! ‘Chloe, thou art the sweetest of sweet things: I hate dull constancy—'tis such a bore: It ruins Love—'tis such a piece of lumber, Kind Venus, let it not my back encumber, Come, Chloe, come—thy beauties I adore: ‘Come to the fields—thy husband's gone to town— O come, and let me give thee a green gown. ‘Love is a butterfly that skims about, From hill to vale, and stops at every flow'r; Sucks all the honey with its little snout, So pleas'd the rich ambrosia to devour; Then on wild wing, away it flies again, The sultan of the variegated plain. ‘Chloe, we'll imitate the ways of France; For Constancy's a very dull romance— Fit only for a poor old grunting dame; And blind old Darby, full of ail and groan, Forc'd to be led about by limping Joan, Of girls the titter, and of boys the game. ‘But Love, my dear, is neither lame nor blind; All energy—his life, eternal spring; Roams the wide world as wanton as the wind, And scorns the fetters that would bind his wing; Then, Chloe, learn to prize the varied kiss, And prove of sweet inconstancy the bliss.’ Such was the song of thousands—such the song Of one King Louis—of his lady tir'd; Who dragg'd with pain the marriage clog along, And lo, a lady of his court desir'd. Yes, yes, his majesty, much, much too blame, Had a colt's tooth, and lov'd another dame. His minister (a bishop, I presume) Inform'd him of the danger of his soul, And pointed strongly to the day of doom, And heav'n-ward his two eyes began to roll— Much as to say, ‘O king if this way given, Your majesty will never get to heav'n.’ ‘Stick to your virtuous queen,’ the bishop sigh'd; ‘Go to the Devil,’ the king in secret cry'd. The king, not relishing the priest's instructions, His heaps of quoted Scripture—sage deductions, Order'd him partridge constantly for dinner: No dish beside—'twas partridge ev'ry day, From this at length the bishop turn'd away, Grew sick, and groan'd like a repentant sinner. Many wry mouths he made—‘Toujours perdrix!’ Partridge and priest in short could not agree: He now felt constancy a mawkish thing. A proselyte with long long face he came, Desir'd to know the pretty lady's name, Turn'd pimp himself, and brought her to the king. Die but Crim. Con.—the region smiles, And glory crowns the Queen of Isles! Old-age shall soon be hobbling seen With blooming virgins of eighteen, Panting, and coughing up an amorous sigh: Yes, wheezing, wrinkled age shall woo, And paw and drivel, kiss and coo, And shake his crutches, and in triumph cry: ‘Horns, I defy you—horns no more I dread; Fearless I wake, and fearless go to bed. ‘In wedlock's cage my nightingale shall sing And lull my senses with a charming note: I dare that damned rakehell a red coat To pull a single feather from its wing.’ But then the batter'd rake will boast— ‘Though past my prime, my vigour lost, And full of holes my aching bones; Though gone my teeth, my cheeks all pale, And foul my breath that taints the gale, And night a witness of my groans; ‘A virgin of a thousand charms Shall bring her beauty to my arms; While happy (from dishonour safe) My head at rams and bulls shall laugh.’ What modesty the man inspires! How sweet the scheme the knave proposes! What justice too in his desires! A carrion on a bed of roses! ‘I will ascend,’ exclaims another rake, ‘Yes, I will mount the highest places; The beds of virgin innocence shall shake; I'll kiss the daughters of the Graces. ‘Thus will I spread (a king of blisses) Mine empire o'er the world of kisses. ‘Wild as the roe my feet shall bound: I'll graze in ev'ry neighbour's ground; In vain my injur'd spouse shall wake and weep: Well hamper'd by Lord Auckland's chain, She dares not of her wrongs complain; Her sighs must whisper, and her anger sleep.’ How manners change! the times of old, When wives were lent, and bought and sold, Must make a modern husband smile! Cato was often known to send To this, and that, and t'other friend, To lend his wife a little while. If gone from Rome for air or water, What then? why lend a pretty daughter. What happen'd?—One of them was sent to Cato, With as much cordiality and ease, As though the sage had begg'd for a potatoe, A pot of mustard, or a slice of cheese! The Grecian sages also (monstrous strange!) All gentlemen of moral lives, Met just like horse-dealers, or Jews on 'Change, To buy, and swop, and borrow wives. Now from digression to return,— Crim. Con. must die, and thousands mourn. No more shall wanton princes now Attempt to milk a subject's cow: No more John T?ds The author is mistaken here. Her grace was at the time of his lordship's amorous attack, in her weeds.—The editor. shall attack a duchess; Who, chaste as Dian, scream'd for help, And, struggling with the wicked whelp, Escap'd all spotless from his savage clutches. No charming Mistress Hodges shall appear, Nor Mister Hodges aid his tender dear, To plant the horn upon his willing skull: Lady Cadogans, with inviting charms, Lure no more pamper'd parsons to her arms, Help'd by that pretty pimp, Miss Farley Bull. Lady Westmeaths no more shall rise, Victims of fascinating eyes, To fill the trump of scandal, and inspire Old prudish maids with jealous fits, Drive virtuous wives out of their wits, And set our envying, envying youth on fire. No Betty Leekes, to talk of a loose dress, When Bradshaw came to woo the noble dame; No powder'd, towzled couch their hours to bless, No coachman to proclaim their acts of shame: And last of all, no catering Mister Hogg The bookseller., To suit salacious tastes with prurient prog. No more shall hawkers gallop on, Roaring away, ‘Crim. Con. Crim. Con.!’ While Abigails from houses, with a caper, Rush, giggling, forth, to buy the paper: To show their ladies, happy, none will doubt it, To wink and sneer, and prattle all about it. No more a counsel's blush shall spring, Nor loftier B?r with sweet grace, Hide in his handkerchief his face, When evidence has been too near the thing Counsel will not be forc'd to say, When did they kiss?—in garish day, Or by the candle's conscious trembling light? Were they in bed beneath the sheet, Snug in embrace—both tête-à-tête? And what were things that might appear in sight? Such shall no more be heard in court, Making for idle ears a sport. Too often wives who lose at play, With honour debts of honour pay; And slily to some Cyprian fane repair— Invoke of Love the saucy pow'r, To Cupid sacrifice an hour, And lo! return with so much ease and air, As though it were a millinery trip! So out of breath in quest of Mistress Snip! All in the house of Wedlock shall be quiet; No sighs to soften, and no pulse to riot; And Chastity, in danger now no more, Shall sleep without a lock upon her door. ‘'Tis a bad wind that blows no good,’ A proverb older than the flood. Cries pert Miss Fornication, with a wink; ‘Aye, kill my sister—do—and soon I'll play young ladies such a tune, Aye, spinster reputation soon shall sink: I'll deal in billets-doux and sighs; I'll open necks and sharpen eyes; I'll make their gowns and petticoats of gauze; I'll do the business of the maids! I'll make more routes and masquerades; I'll sharpen Mister Satan's claws. ‘I'll order it with nymph and swain, That cheeks shall never blush again. ‘I'll build to Methodism more chapels, Where lad with lass so sweetly grapples Soon as the tell-tale candles are put out: Yes, yes, the love-feasts shall increase, And Modesty, that mincing piece, Shall say, “Good bye t'ye,” to the groaning rout. ‘I'll aid Hypocrisy's dark cause, And for a parson choose a H?s While Alnwinkle exists, the conscientious act of this Huntingtonian apostle will be remembered.; I'll ope new turnpikes to salvation, Or I'm not christen'd Fornication.’ Thus wildly she exclaims! and, by the Lord, I think the hussey means to keep her word; Thus have I pour'd a pair of odes, Which some may deem the songs of gods; But hark! a second solemn voice I hear— A second awful voice that cries, ‘Bard, bard, thine oracles are lies; Crim. Con. has nought from Auckland's rage to fear, That lord from morn to night, and night to morn, Shall trembling view the visionary horn.’ ADVICE TO YOUNG WOMEN; OR, THE ROSE AND STRAWBERRY. A FABLE. Young women! don't be fond of killing, Too well I know your hearts unwilling To hide beneath the veil a charm— Too pleas'd a sparkling eye to roll, And with a neck to thrill the soul Of ev'ry swain with Love's alarm. Yet, yet, if Prudence be not near, Its snow may melt into a tear. The dimpled smile, and pouting lip, Where little Cupids nectar sip, Are very pretty lures, I own: But, ah! if Prudence be not nigh, Those lips, where all the Cupids lie, May give a passage to a groan. A Rose, in all the pride of bloom, Flinging around her rich perfume, Her form to public notice pushing, Amidst the summer's golden glow, Peep'd on a Strawberry below, Beneath a leaf, in secret blushing. ‘Miss Strawberry,’ exclaim'd the Rose, ‘What's beauty that no mortal knows? What is a charm, if never seen? You really are a pretty creature: Then wherefore hide each blooming feature? Come up, and show your modest mien.’ ‘Miss Rose,’ the Strawberry replied, I never did possess a pride That wish'd to dash the public eye: Indeed I own that I'm afraid— I think there's safety in the shade; Ambition causes many a sigh.’ ‘Go, simple child,’ the Rose rejoin'd, ‘See how I wanton in the wind: I feel no danger's dread alarms: And then observe the god of day, How amorous with his golden ray, To pay his visits to my charms!’ No sooner said, but with a scream She started from her fav'rite theme— A clown had on her fix'd his pat. In vain she screech'd—Hob did but smile; Rubb'd with her leaves his nose awhile, Then bluntly stuck her in his hat. ODE TO HYMEN. O tell me, Hymen, how it comes to pass, That folks live not in unison, alas! That all thy votaries are not always blest? Thy pretty fane is enter'd all so billing, So am'rous, so obliging, smiling, willing; When lo! Love's passion sinks at once to rest! An ignorant poor bachelor am I, And stupid, knowing not the reason why! Love seems at first within the torrid zone, Now to the temperate, lo, his course he bends; Now to the frigid limpeth with a groan, And now the sweetest of all passions ends! Look to the simple state, the state of clowns, Born in a hut, and seldom from their downs! Thus Lubin, in a Glo'ster hamlet bred, Soon as the honey-moon began to shine; ‘Now, Deary (I suppose the pair in bed) Now put thy pretty little totes An abbreviation, I presume, of pettitoes, frequently used in Gloucestershire. to mine.’ But when, ah me! the honey-moon was over, Adieu the lover! And what the soul of delicacy shocks, Instead of ‘Put thy pretty totes to mine,’ He turn'd his back, and grunted like a swine, ‘Why dost not heave away thy d?mn'd greea hocks?’ ODE ON THE PASSIONS. The passions are all prone to sad disorders, Whose objects never should approach their borders! ‘O lead us not into temptation!’ Is a choice pray'r, and which I much admire— So many things are dangerous to desire! So ripe for soul-assassination! Young women, par exemple, O how sweet, How fascinating each wild sense they greet! How much we long to smell to the fair flow'r! How long the blushing peach to pluck it, And suck it— To use an epicurish phrase, devour! Now such desires are very dangerous things— It does not signify to talk about it: Yet seemed Solomon, first of wise kings, And eke his father David, much to doubt it. For wheresoe'er they met a pretty lass, Snap was the word—they could not let her pass. How many a time I thought it not a sin To press the virgin's cheek and dimpled chin, And press her pouting lip, that dew-clad cherry! And peep upon her neck of Alpine snow, And pressing, panting, to her bosom grow, Rich banquet—very—I repeat it—very! But lo! I stand reform'd, thank Heav'n, So much of grace to me is giv'n! O youths! whene'er the wishes warm of nature, Tumultuous rise—destroy their dangerous dance; The curb of reason to your aid advance, And souse them with her buckets of cold water. No harm is in the passions, to be sure; But then they must not gallop wild to door— Close keep them, just like hounds that long for hare; Or muzzle them, indeed, like ferrets; And thus suppress their wanton spirits, That lawless wish to be as free as air. Well I remember (but the times are past, Thank Heav'n, this wickedness can't always last) When if a petticoat but caught my eye— A petticoat surrounding some fair maid, Lord bless us! how my heart's brisk fountain play'd! Grace was abjur'd, and Prudence forc'd to fly. The passions, sudden wak'd to watch her, And, hound-like, scamper'd in full cry to catch her. The passions, as I've said, are far from evil; But if not well confin'd, they play the devil. Learn from that candle—mark its govern'd flame, How in its lustre, gentle, steady, tame, So mild, such trembling modesty, so quiet!— But let him touch your curtains, or your bed, Who on such stuff delighteth to be fed, Lo, in a brace of minutes, what a riot! He pulls (for nought th' unbridled rogue reveres) Like Samson, an old house about his ears! NIL ADMIRARI; OR, A SMILE AT A BISHOP: Occasioned by A Hyperbolical Eulogy on Miss Hannah More, By Dr. Porteus, In his late Charge to the Clergy. ? Est modus in rebus —HOR. There is reason in roasting eggs. Lo, Novelty shall lead the world astray, And cast ev'n bishops wide of Wisdom's bias; A mouse has prov'd the lion of the day; Witness that miserable imp M?th?as. THE ARGUMENT. Peter prettily and poetically proclaimeth the pernicious Effects of Flattery—he solemnly addresseth Doctor Porteus, as of the celebrated School of Warburton; loading the Doctor with appropriate and complimentary Epithets— Though Peter acknowledgeth the Bishop's overmatch for the Devil and Sin, he denieth his Powers over Taste—shrewdly hinteth that a wise Father may have a foolish Son—proveth the Bishop's Want of critical Acumen, by his hyperbolical Praises of Miss Hannah More, a Rhime-and-Prose Gentlewoman, born at Bristol —Peter, having narrowly searched Miss Hannah, and tried Miss Hannah by his own Touchstone, discovereth the metallic Nature of Miss Hannah's Genius—Peter solemnly protesteth that he cannot wade twice through Miss Hannah's Works, deeming them, as Dr. Johnson would have expressed himself, Pages of puerile Vanity and intellectual Imbecility. Soft is the voice of Flatt'ry! sweet her song! Ah, much too sweet for man, vain man, I fear! Her oil of fool, too fluent, glides along, And winding, drops with death, into his ear. O Porteus, of the Warburtonian school, Meek, modest, generous, diffident, and humble, 'Tis said that sometimes sages play the fool; But when they stumble, with a vengeance stumble: Though form'd to brighten all the human race, Rare flint and steel, illumining the dark; Though, like an egg, so full of faith, and grace, Like thy great The late Bishop Warburton, of lamb-like memory. Prototype of Pryor Park; Though bravely furious for the fight, to tame Old Nick, and eke his dirty mother Sin, With every sort of weapon one can name, Ev'n from the thundering cannon to a pin; Yet, Porteus, though a giant with thy blows, That Sin's and Satan's hides with glory baste, A dwarf art thou, in fields of verse and prose— A very pigmy in the realms of taste. What tho' thou rhime hast made, it does not follow, The critic's laurel must thy temples shade; A man may be descended from Apollo, And yet a novice in the critic trade. Nay, man may scarce be equal to a pun; Yet sprung from Phœbus, but without his art: Less fit to guide the chariot of the sun, Than that more humble vehicle, a cart. With sighs I tell thee of Miss Hannah More, A mighty genius, in thy charge display'd! Know, I have search'd the damsel o'er and o'er, And only find Miss Hannah, a good maid. Oft by my touchstone have I tried the lass, And see no shining mark of gold appear; No, nor one beam of silver; some small brass, And lead and glittering mundic, in thine ear. A sorry critic, thou, in prose and metre, Or thou hadst judg'd her pow'r a scanty rill; Which, if thou wilt believe the word of Peter, Crawls at the bottom of th' Aonian hill. Twice can't I read her labours for my blood, So simply mawkish, so sublimely sad! I own Miss Hannah's life is very good, But then her verse and prose are very bad. No muse e'er touch'd Miss Hannah's lips with fire; No fountain hers of bright imagination: So little doth a genuine muse inspire, That genius will not own her a relation. Miss Hannah's graces dazzle not the view— No bonfire she—no sun's meridian blaze:— A rush-light 'midst th' illuminating few: A farthing rush-light, with its winking rays. Miss Hannah has no eagle-wing to flee, Whom thus thine adulation can befool: Alas! a poor ephemeron is she! A humming native of a Bristol pool. ARGUMENT. Peter sorely complaineth of Miss Hannah's cracked Instrument—announceth Women superior to Miss Hannah.—Miss Hannah laugheth in her Sleeve at the Bishop's Praise.—Peter thinketh that Mount Parnassus would have shed no Tears had Miss Hannah never written—he blameth the Bishop for making a Show of Miss Hannah.— Peter exhibiteth his Candour, in condemning rather the Flattery of the Bishop, than Miss Hannah's literary Imbecility.—Peter rippeth up the Blue-stocking Club, for their foolish Exhibition of Miss Hannah—he acknowledgeth the Power of Novelty, particularly with respect to a Pamphlet of one of the smaller Rats of the Queen's Closet, called Mathias—he giveth the little Animal a good Drubbing.—Peter hinteth at some of Miss Hannah's clerical Friends in the Reviews—sensibly animadverteth on the varnish-eating Power of Father Time. Indeed, Miss Hannah hath a so-so lyre; So out of tune, it murders all the Nine: She really playeth not with taste or fire: No, Doctor Porteus, no, thou great divine! Know, Porteus, we have women of renown, Miss Hannah's equals, or my judgment fail: Nay, numbers, I aver it! of whose gown Miss Hannah is not fit to hold the tail. With smiles her eulogy Miss Hannah hears; Laughs in her sleeve at all thy pompous praise: In silence wrapp'd, perceives the ass's ears, And sits complacent while her Stentor brays. Had Wisdom crush'd Miss Hannah's forward quill— Had Silence put a gag on Hannah's tongue— No crape had mourn'd, upon the Muses' hill, Nor Phœbus blubber'd for the loss of song. Hadst thou not fondly dragg'd Miss Hannah forth, Plac'd her on high, and cried, ‘Behold a wonder!’ No soul had scrutiniz'd the woman's worth; Safe from the world her weakness and thy blunder. Thy praise of Hannah is a pillar fair, A lofty pillar, but supporting what? Why, on its head, supporting high in air A mole, a grasshopper, a mouse, a rat. Calm, but for thee, had Hannah pass'd along: Oblivion ready, with her shroud and spade, To sink her with a prose and rhiming throng In sacred silence, and eternal shade. But no! the bishop stops her on her way; Ah! wherefore?—God Almighty only knows! To gibbet her amid the blaze of day, A piteous carcass for the critic crows, People should not run riot with applause; But, ah! how many praise without pretence? Bawl for a work with wide-extended jaws; Of words a deluge, and a drop of sense! I censure not Miss Hannah for sad prose— I censure not Miss Hannah for sad rhimes: God sees my heart! I only censure those Whose flatteries damn the judgment of the times. The Bas-bleu Club, grave grey-beards, these old dames All righteous, cramm'd to mouth with heav'nly manna, Ambitious of a wit among their names, Into their magic-lantern clapp'd Miss Hannah: Then bade the bishop look with wond'ring eyes— The bishop's wond'ring orbs enjoy'd the sight— ‘A giantess of genius!’ Porteus cries, Forgetting it a literary mite. Yet Novelty shall lead the world astray, And turn ev'n bishops off from Wisdom's bias; A mouse shall start the lion of the day— Witness that miserable imp Mathias This poor little wretch, whose pamphlet misnomered Pursuits of Literature, but whose true appellation should have been Pursuits of Rancour, dared not acknowledge his own work.—The enormity of its falshood and impudence was quite a novelty, and in spite of its contemptible imbecility, gained the attention of the public.—This, Mathias mistook for fame: still he denied any connexion with the pamphlet—every paltry subterfuge was made use of, to escape detection. At length a few literary hounds seriously pursued him, hunted him fairly to his hole, and put the vermin to death.. Behold! this human snake, or human toad, Sly, 'mid the windings of his murky hole, Pour'd on the shrinking world his pois'nous load, And on the sighs of Merit fed his soul. But lo, of short duration was his date! Soon stopp'd the torrent of his wounding lust: Justice stepp'd forth to give the fiend his fate, And crush'd him 'midst the reptiles of the dust. Though Hannah's prose present us nothing new, Though Hannah's verse be lame, insipid stuff; Some sable critic, in some kind review, Shall give the little paper-kite a puff. At length comes Time, with Truth's pervading ray, To separate the living from the dead; Clears the dark clouds of Prejudice away, And roasts the varnish off, by Flatt'ry spread. And lo, this varnish with thy daubing brush Smear'd o'er Miss Hannah must by Time be roasted; The nymph in all her nakedness will blush, And courtly Porteus, for a flatterer posted. ARGUMENT. Peter fancieth that he hath put the Bishop in a Passion—he giveth his Opinion of a Book called Strictures upon Female Education, with Miss Hannah's name annexed—he subtracteth greatly from the Merit of Miss Hannah in those Volumes.—Peter Describeth Miss Hannah's Mode of manœuvring, by two apt and beautiful Comparisons, Hemp and Leather—he likeneth Miss Hannah unto a Hen, who hatcheth the Eggs of another Bird—he confesseth her exemplary Piety and Snow-like appearance, but severely reprimandeth her Uncharitableness towards the frail ones of her own Sex.—Peter praiseth his own celestial Disposition in favour of fallen Beauty—he addresseth the barbarous Part of the Female Creation: asserting that Love and an old Lady are not incompatible— he giveth the Judges a Stroke for their amorous Faces on Trials of Rape and Crim. Con. —Peter windeth up sublimely and charitably. Now, Porteus, I behold thee in a passion, And thus exclaiming—‘What! Miss Hannah More No genius! what is then her Education, So prais'd and echoed o'er and o'er?’ I'll tell thee, Porteus, what.—Miss Hannah's Strictures Are decent things—perhaps Miss Hannah's plan: But, trust me, they are all some parson's pictures: These, Hannah never drew, nor colour'd, man! At times she finds of hemp a little wad, Begs some young Levite spin it:—nothing loth, He adds large quantities of flax, kind lad, And with the mixture fabricates a cloth. Again—Miss Hannah finds a scrap of leather, Horse-skin—and, slily, to some Crispin goes: Crispin adds calf-skin—puts them both together, And makes a tolerable pair of shoes. Miss Hannah may be aptly term'd a hen, Who sits on pheasant's egg, to kindness prone; Hatches the birds, a pretty brood; but then, Weak vanity, she call the chicks her own. Miss Hannah's piety we all admire, Her life a field of Alpine snow so white! And what our good opinion must inspire, With bishops she could talk from morn to night. Oh! had good Hannah been not so severe On each young victim of her tempting bloom! Instead of sarcasm dropp'd a pitying tear, And with a beam of comfort cheer'd her gloom! I cannot drag the nymph to grinning day: I cannot curse the nymph of yielding charms: Instead of casting the poor girl away, Lord! I would rather clasp her in my arms! Hang on her lip, bestow the generous kiss; Catch the pure drop that leaves her liquid eye: And gently chiding the unlicens'd bliss, Reclaim the beauteous mourner with a sigh. O think of Love, ye ladies of hard hearts! Lo nature weaves it close in ev'ry cranny! Ev'n from old women rarely it departs, The subject sweet of many a shaking granny. Ev'n judges for their gravity rever'd, I've seen upon Crim. Con. with passion gape; With wanton questions wag the watering beard, Point the hot eye, and chuckle at a rape. Prudery, I hate the hag, whose breath would blight The opening buds of gentle May and June; Blest to spread darkness, like the cloud of night, That hangs a dirty malkin on the moon! Oh, be the wounded prude, who dares reprove, And furious charge the feeble maid of dame, A nymph, who, cautious of the torch of Love, Has never sing'd her honour at its flame. ARGUMENT. Peter declareth that he liketh literary Emulation amongst the Sex, but contendeth for fair Play —that is to say, People should publish their own Works—Peter knoweth Miss Hannah's havage, knoweth all her Points, and pronounceth her unqualified for a first-rate Racer, whatever her powers among the Ponies—Peter elucidateth the Frauds in Literature by a Smock-Race—Peter turneth to the Bishop, and asketh a shrewd Question—He solemnly calleth on the Bishop's Attention, and sayeth oracular Things!—Peter supplicateth the Bishop to think charitably of his rhiming Intentions—he dreadeth the fatal Effects of his Flattery of Miss Hannah; making her hold up her Nose in Contempt of the under-World, knowing none but Quality—Peter asserteth such Flattery to be a Sin, as it stirreth up Pride, which every body knows ruined the Devil—Peter citeth a proverb taken from Hell— he again beggeth the Bishop to think well of his Intentions—proclaimeth his Love for Bishops, perhaps equal to that of the unbeneficed Clergy —Peter draweth a Parallel between Bishops of old, and Bishops of the present Day—a terrible Portrait of the old School!—a most engaging one of the new—Peter piously concludeth with a Prayer for Bishops. I like a rivalship in art, I own— Yes, let there be a spur to emulation: But let fair Justice sit upon her throne, And keep a little decent regulation. Lo, for the laurel prize Miss Hannah starts! But Nature, to Miss Hannah's heels unkind, The hopes of honour and of glory thwarts! Left is Miss Hannah's far, yes, far behind. Miss Hannah's heels are greasy, let me say; Miss Hannah's joints are very stiff indeed: Her form is rather fitted for the dray, Than on Newmarket turf to show a speed. Some years ago, I saw a female race; The prize a shift—a Holland shift, I ween: Ten damsels, nearly all in naked grace, Rush'd for the precious prize along the green. Sylvia, a charming lass (who, if an air And face had been permitted to contend, Had carried all before her), luckless fair! Was to her sister racers forc'd to bend. When Orson mounted on a goodly mule, Whose love for Sylvia to her cause inclin'd him, In spite, ye gods, of ev'ry racing rule, Whipp'd up the damsel on the beast behind him. Then off he gallop'd, pass'd each panting maid, Who mark'd the cheat with disappointed eyes; Soon brought her in, unblushing at his aid, And for his fav'rite boldly claim'd the prize. O say, has nought been very like it, here? Did no kind swain his hand to Hannah yield— No bishop's hand to help a heavy rear, And bear the nymph triumphant o'er the field? List to the oracles I now advance— A man stark blind should never races run; A cripple never should pretend to dance; A head of wax should never court the sun. Then bid Miss Hannah More her pen confine: Repress the vainly rhiming, prosing rage, That makes us sinful damn the nerveless line, Un-Job-like curse the pen'ry of the page. Good Porteus, think not Envy prompts my strain; 'Tis Pity, Pity bids me verse compose, Thy flattery's fumes must turn the virgin's brain, So fierce its incense burns beneath her nose. Oh, hadst thou crawl'd a curate, let me say, Harmless thy flatt'ry then had spent its breath; Just whisper'd to the world, and died away, Like thy own sermons, and dead lines on Death. Miss Hannah's head is now among the clouds, Borne by the necromantic art of praise! The nymph from vulgar eyes her glory shrouds, To mix with high-ton'd quality her rays. To them, Miss Hannah, strutting forth so fine, In all thy gaudy flow'rs superbly drest, Must raise a smile on graver mouths than mine; Such seeming mock'ry—such a solemn jest! An oracle behold Miss Hannah grown! Each child of title lisps Miss Hannah's name; A bishop's plaudit sanctifies a Joan:— What better passport to the house of Fame? Thus then, O man of God, thy flattery sins: For thou hast conjur'd up the woman's vanity— Bestow'd false consequence on heads of pins, And giv'n (O blush!) a substance to inanity. Thus then thy praises of Miss Hannah's head To Pride, that pitfall of old Satan, win her! Porteus there is a proverb thou shouldst read, ‘When flatt'rers meet, the Devil goes to dinner.’ Deem not, good Porteus, that in this my song I mean to harrow up thy humble mind, And stay that voice in London known so long; For balm and softness an Etesian wind. My love for bishops is proverbial grown: Sweet is the race, and so Miss Hannah says: Where'er I wander, lo! I make it known! How different from the tribes of distant days! Long were a bishop's tusks in times of yore, His gaping gullet flam'd the track of Hell: Loud as the Libyan lion's was his roar, His frowns like lightning, blasting where they fell. Then Persecution rais'd her iron crow, And saw, with doating eye, her power display'd; Enjoy'd the flying brains at ev'ry blow, And bless'd the knives and hooks with which she flay'd. Grill'd, roasted, carbonaded, fricaseed, Men, women, children, for the slightest things; Burnt, strangled, glorying in the horrid deed; Nay, starv'd and flogg'd God's great vicegerents, kings! But things are chang'd—assume a different tone, The teeth of bishops are a gentle set; Content, if nought is near, to pick a bone; So little pamper'd with delicious meat. How sweet the smile, when bishop, bishop greets! How flow the honey'd streams of salutation, Ev'n in the middle of our London streets: Rich lessons of good-will to all the nation! No scorn now frowneth from a bishop's eye, No sounds of anger from his lips escape; Save on a curate's importuning sigh, Save on the penury of ragged crape. Now God preserve the bishops, every skin, To blaze like beacons to the darken'd nations; To roast old Satan, knock down Gammer Sin, And for a pack of rascals hang the passions. Thus ends my song, perhaps, a child of Fame.— And now, for Justice' sake, let me petition: Should Fortune chance to give thy charge a name, Omit Miss Hannah's in the next edition. EXPOSTULATION; OR, AN ADDRESS TO MISS HANNAH MORE. Miss Hannah has no eagle wing to flee, Whom thus thine adulation would befool: Alas! a poor ephemeron is she; A humming native of a British pool. ADVERTISEMENT. Miss HANNAH MORE having, with unmerited severity, nay, illiberality, attacked the poor poets en masse, alias in a lump, in the following terms, viz. ‘The poets again, who, to do them justice, are always ready to lend a helping hand when any mischief is to be done;’ I have, unlike Miss Hannah, preserved a Christian spirit on the occasion, a spirit whiich she every-where so fervently recommends, and meekly made my complaint in poetical expostulation, hoping that she will, with the usual assistance of her good friends the clergy, vouchsafe me an answer, in some measure to justify the slander, or expunge it in the next edition of what are called her Strictures on Female Education Vide Strictures on Female Education, vol. ii.. P. P. ARGUMENT. The Poet begs to be informed of the Cause of Miss Hannah's Wrath—he praiseth the Mildness of the Poets—he putteth sly and shrewd Questions to Miss Hannah—Peter complaineth of Miss Hannah's general Sarcasm on himself and brother Bards—Peter puffeth himself—boasteth of the royal Attention to his Works—also of one of the Princesses, all the Favourites of Peter, whom Peter admireth and laudeth—also of Miss Tryon, late Maid of Honour, and the present Maids of Honour—likewise of the immortal Kotsciusko —Peter, with his accustomed Liberality, exhibiteth the Reverse of the Medal, describing the unfavourable Opinion entertained of him by the Blue-Stocking Club—he giveth the Anathema of a little old Man in Petticoats, called Urganda, an important Membress of the Society, and much attended to in the Debates— Dame Urganda calleth upon Miss Hannah to be the little David of the Club, and slay Goliah Peter—Peter cannot account for Miss Hannah's Attack on the Poets—He maketh Miss Hannah a grand Offer of composing a glorious Panegyric on her splendid Genius, the very Instant Miss Hannah informs him where it is to be found. Say, angry Hannah, on a gentle throng, Why boils thus o'er the caldron of thine ire? A dove-like offspring are the sons of song, A cherub race the children of the lyre. Poets were ever deem'd a sacred band, Abounding with much virtue, meekness, grace; Indeed a peaceful treasure to the land, The robin redbreasts of the human race. Oh! has no bard to Hannah pour'd an air; With Hannah's beauty bid no stanza glow: Her cheeks' warm roses, and her flaxen hair, The lip of purple, and the neck of snow. Oh! hast thou past through life without a rhime? No sweet acrostic on thy liquid name? No rebus, no conundrum's happy chime, Proclaiming graces, and a hopeless flame? Tell me, did no fond lover ever write A decent distich on his fav'rite maid? Not to his dear Lucretia once endite? For sonneteering is the lover's trade. Somewhat has wounded thee, 'tis very plain! Revenge, I fear, lies rankling in thy heart; Then say thy cause of anger and disdain— Why on poor Poets hast thou been so tart? Much for the poet's character I feel— And me a poet, majesty will own: Nay, nay, my glory why should I conceal? My works, morocco-gilt, are near the throne. The charming princesses who court the Nine, Whom Taste delighted proudly leads along— These, with a smile, have read my early line, And with their names shall grace my latest song. Miss Tyron, maid of honour to the queen, In rich Morocco bid my works be bound: Beneath the pillows of the rest, I ween, The works of Peter Pindar may be found. Me Kotsciusco deems a bard divine! My works illum'd his dungeon When a prisoner in Russia. of affright: 'Twas there the hero read my lyric line, Yea, read my lucubrations with delight. To me the hero rich Falernian sent, To sooth the horrors of our gloomy weather; To him in Leicester-Fields with joy I went, For bards and heroes pair like doves together. Yet let me say, be done fair Justice too, Some damn in toto my poor thoughts and style; The toothless gums of half the grave Bas-bleu, Watering, and wondering, how the world can smile. Urganda, with more beard than female grace, If old Urganda has not learnt to shave, Makes, at my name, most horrible grimace, Screaming, ‘I'd buy a rope to hang the knave.’ ‘My dearest, sweetest, panegyrist, More, Pray, pray oblige me with your flippant pen; Lord; you have so much wit—yes, such a store! Pray, Hannah, cut us up this worst of men. ‘Oh, cut the fellow into mince-meat, pray! Whene'er I hear his name, I'm in a stew; He's worse than Johnson, ten times, let me say, Who gave himself such airs on the Bas-bleu. ‘O Lord! O Lord! what is Parnassus now? A dismal, barren, melancholy waste; Brambles, and weeds, and briars on the brow; No fruit—no fruit to gratify the taste. ‘In short, this once great celebrated hill Exhibits only children at the nipple; A hospital, indeed, that idiots fill, And every sort of lame and hopping cripple. ‘On you, our little David, mind, we call, To knock this vile Goliah on the head; Down with him!—like a bullock let him fall; Down with him!—Lord! I long to see him dead! ‘Then, then, the horrid monster grins no more; Then at our club the owl no longer hoots: Thus shall our club the glorious deed adore.’— Thus spoke the little proud old puss in boots! But now to thee, fair Hannah to return, For much I long thy fury's cause to know; Nought have I done to bid thine anger burn; My ink can never blot the vest of snow. Lo! to do justice—with a liberal spirit, I'm now on tip-toe, to begin my lays! Hint to the poet but thy various merit, I'll make Parnassus thunder with thy praise. DUPLICITY;How unlike the bishops of old are our modern men of lawn! Formerly they were all pride, hyprocrisy, insolence, and rapacity; but behold! the present race are mild, affable, charitable, and generous; and though so eminently exalted above their half-starved curates, appear to have been bred (gentle doves) in the bosom of humility. OR, THE BISHOP OF OLD. A Bishop, not a British bishop,—no— (Ours are a sweeter set of saints, I trow) Was by his sovereign sent to rule abroad: Immediately upon the news Of his arrival, came some Jews To compliment the mitred man of God. ‘Jews!’ bawl'd the bishop, in the direst passion, ‘D'ye think I'll see that vile apostate nation? Run, Pierrot—drive them off—run faster, faster; Tell them they crucified my Heavenly Master.’ ‘But sir, but sir,’ quoth Pierrot, stepping back, Devoutly whispering in the bishops's ear— These Jews bring presents! Lord! at least a sack.’ ‘Ah! ah!’ replied the bishop—less austere— These people could know nothing of the sin— Poor creatures! well, well, Pierrot, let 'em in.’ SIMPLICITY; OR, THE CURATE. How difficult, alas! to please mankind! One or the other every moment mutters: This wants an eastern, that a western wind; A third, petition for a southern, utters. Some pray for rain, and some for frost and snow; How can Heav'n suit all palates?—I don't know. Good Lamb, the curate, much approv'd, Indeed by all his flock belov'd, Was one dry summer begg'd to pray for rain: The parson most devoutly pray'd— The pow'rs of pray'r were soon display'd; Immediately a torrent drench'd the plain. It chanc'd that the churchwarden, Robin Jay, Had of his meadow not yet sav'd the hay: Thus was his hay to health quite past restoring. It happen'd too that Robin was from home; But when he heard the story, in a foam He sought the parson, like a lion roaring. ‘Zounds! Parson Lamb, why what have you been doing? A pretty storm, indeed, ye have been brewing! What! pray for rain before I sav'd my hay! Oh! you're a cruel and ungrateful man! I that for ever help you all I can; Ask you to dine with me and Mrs. Jay, Whenever we have something on the spit, Or in the pot a nice and dainty bit; ‘Send you a goose, a pair of chicken, Whose bones you are so fond of picking; And often too a cag of brandy! You that were welcome to a treat, To smoke and chat, and drink and eat; Making my house so very handy! ‘You, parson, serve one such a scurvy trick! Zounds! you must have the bowels of Old Nick. What! bring the flood of Noah from the skies, With my fine field of hay before your eyes! A numscull, that I wer'n't of this aware!— Curse me but I had stopp'd your pretty pray'r!’ ‘Dear Mister Jay,’ quoth Lamb, ‘alas! alas! I never thought upon your field of grass. ‘Lord! parson, you're a fool one might suppose— Was not the field just underneath your nose? This is a very pretty losing job!’— ‘Sir,’ quoth the curate, ‘know that Harry Cobb Your brother warden join'd, to have the pray'r.’ ‘Cobb! Cobb! why this for Cobb was only sport: What doth Cobb own that any rain can hurt?’ Roar'd furious Jay as broad as he could stare. ‘The fellow owns, as far as I can larn, A few old houses only, and a barn, As that's the case, zounds, what are show'rs to him?’ Not Noah's flood could make his trumpery swim. ‘Besides—why could you not for drizzle pray? Why force it down in buckets on the hay? Would I have play'd with your hay such a freak? No! I'd have stopp'd the weather for a week.’ ‘Dear Mister Jay, I do protest, I acted solely for the best; I do affirm it, Mister Jay, indeed. Your anger for this once restrain, I'll never bring a drop again Till you and all the parish are agreed.’ ODE TO THE BLUE STOCKING-CLUB. ARGUMENT. Peter addresseth the old literary Ladies with much poetical Solemnity—beggeth their Pardon for taking Liberties with Miss Hannah More, one of the Columns of the Blue-Stocking-Club —he hinteth to them that Miss Hannah's last Book is not Miss Hannah's.—Peter illustrateth Miss Hannah's Manœuvres by a sublime Comparison of an old Mouser and her Daughter. —Peter indulgeth himself in another apt Comparison of a Fish-theft, thinking Miss Hannah may, in a sly Way, have borrowed her last publication; and adviseth the Restoration to the Proprietor. Old critics—Gammer Wisdoms—sapient dames, Who fond of being deem'd illustrious names, Proudly o'er Mount Parnassus cast your shoes; In grave Divan, who most sublimely sit, Pronouncing judgment upon works of Wit, Indeed on all the labours of the mouse! Accept a little ode from Peter, Who charms you seldom with his metre. Wise dames, I know your motley club Has met with many a wanton drub From that sly Proteus clepp'd Ridicule: Whose talent is to sneer and laugh, To call important matters raff, And lower Wisdom sometimes to a fool. Now, ladies, don't be in a passion, Because I've treated in such fashion Miss Hannah, whom you idolize and foster: I do assure you, solemn dames, Miss Hannah with no merit flames, No! she's a little bit of an impostor. I know you call the nymph, the sun so bright: Now, she's Miss Moon—and borroweth all her light. Who has not seen a kind old Mother Cat Deliver a dead bird, or mouse, or rat, To her young kitten, Miss Grimalkin? Miss catches it with raptur'd claws, Locks it at once within her jaws, Round with cock'd tail, and round triumphant walking; So carefully her treasure holding, watching, And proudly purring, ‘This is all my catching.’ Has not Miss Hannah been the kitten here? Too strongly she resembles it, I fear! Believe me, your Miss Hannah More, As I have somewhere said before, Starts like the country lasses for the shift; And just like Sylvia left behind, By rivals, much against her mind, Who stole before them by a lucky lift. Miss Hannah, too, a a lucky lift has had On some kind priest's—perchance a bishop's pad! Miss Hannah's work, so much beprais'd, By flattery's puff so highly rais'd; I say Miss Hannah's pretty Education-book, Of fishing parties starts a story, Where one shall steal another's trout or dory, And slily pull it in on his own hook. Now, ladies, as your honours are at stake, I beg you, for your reputation's sake, To sift this pretty larceny of the pen! And as ye probably may find it out, Confront Miss Hannah—kick up some small rout— And make her give the man his fish again. ODE TO SOME ROBIN REDBREASTS, IN A COUNTRY CATHEDRAL. Sweet minstrels of the sounding choir, Your ditties sooth, delight, inspire; That wake the echoes from their deep repose; Soft echoes dying through the dome (As though from spirits of the tomb), Soon as your voices sink in plaintive close! Again, O! lull me with your lay, And let it never die away. How welcome rise your hymns to Heav'n, In gratitude so simply giv'n! Celestials smile upon your songs of praise: For to the chaste angelic ear The grateful voice is ever near, But loath'd the sounds that Affectation brays; And yet how many a voice, and pipe, and chord, Brays to the praise and glory of the Lord! Hark! hark! what rude discordant sounds! A jail broke loose!—a pack of hounds! No, 'tis a bishop, dean, and bawling boys! What uproar wild! The wolves of Thrace Howl'd to the moon with sweeter grace; Ev'n Libya's lions make not half the noise. What human brain the thunder bears; A kingdom for a pair of patent ears! Yet while they deal these direful sounds; Din that disturbs, affrights, astounds; How merciful is Heav'n, to bear the bother, And not knock one thick skull against the other! Yet to the praise and glory of the Lord, As oft they ope the volume of their throat, Their gullets gape not of their own accord:— 'Tis money, money only, prompts the note. Heav'n's cherubs blush, and burning seraphs stare, To think that bribes must purchase praise and pray'r. Sweet race, to you I turn again! Now all the ear-distracting train Has left the dome, the cherub peace restor'd.— How different your delighting throats! How different all your liquid notes! How different too your merits with the Lord! For how can Heav'n with venal sounds be taken, Tainted with ale and gin, and eggs and bacon? Yes; all is hush'd the vault along; Resume, resume the choral song, And make atonement for the horrid cry. Lo! in her shroud, near yonder tomb, A gentle spectre breaks the gloom! She listens!—lo! she listens with a sigh! Ah! bid your airs divinely flow, And, soothing, steal a tear from woe. The deep'ning shades of Night prevail, They wrap the hollow-sounding aisle, And steal each column from the eye: What solemn solitude around! Here Nature's true sublime is found, Hence Thought should travel to the sky! Mild tenants of the fane, farewell! At early dawn I quit my cell, And haste a pilgrim, to these shrines again: Simplicity will join my way, And listen to your mingled lay, And, list'ning, learn a lesson from your strain. ODES TO INS AND OUTS. ? exulet aula Qui volet esse pius: Virtus et summa Potestas Non coëunt. LUCAN. He who would gain Fame's good report, Must have no dealings with a court. Virtue and Power—fair and foul weather, Were never known to pig together. [Ode I.] PROLOGUE. I hate most courtiers, from my soul! Upon each other how they scowl! Yet all politeness—wonderful good-nature— Each tries to get the first employ, By ev'ry engine to destroy, Yet bows, and smiles, and still persists to flatter; And when his rival he has sent to hell, Kind whispers—‘Sir, I hope I see you well.’ How like old Ocean, the old knave! This moment placid, smooth, a bright expanse— The next he thunders, raises every wave, Roars, riots, tumbles, kicks up such a dance, Booms o'er the ship with such a shock, And heaves her on the fatal rock! Within a little hour, one little hour, No more his foamy billows tow'r, But all so crouching, humble, gentle, rot 'em! With timid motion they advance, Seem sorry for the sad mischance, And, winding round the wreck, they kiss its bottom. Reader, didst ever scald thy mouth with custard? Then thou hast curs'd it twenty times, or more, Or didst thou ever to a cat give mustard? If so, grimalkin scratch'd, and spit, and swore. Thus at my rhimes our courtiers swear and spit, Ready to slay me—tear me bit by bit.— I dearly love to hitch the rogues in rhime, And tell the world each various crime; And folly too, ah, often felt and seen! Indeed the act of many a court Would yield the nation charming sport, And chase the gloomy cloud of spleen; But that this folly mingles with much harm— Aye, there's the rub!—the rub, too, to alarm. But, sirs, I'll have my thoughts, and speak them too, In spite of ministerial chains: If a court scoundrel meet my view, I'll laugh at penalties and pains; Smile at the ribbands that their shoulders deck, And wish them good tight ropes about the neck. I'll have my thoughts, and print them too, Ev'n should there be an imprimatur; Sing what is what, and who is who, And, independent, scorn to flatter. There may be ministerial chains, Not only for the tongue, but brains: The time may come when ministerial sway Makes despotism the order of the day— Still will I talk and write as I think fit, Whether man John be Addington or Pitt. ODE II. TO THE K?. Written immediately on Mr. Pitt's Retreat from Administration. An't please your m?y, I'm very glad, And so are all of us (of late so sad) That you have thrown the Jonas overboard, See! see the drowning cat! he spreads his claws! Quickly, for God's sake, sir, chop off his paws!— He dies, by not a single sigh deplor'd. To Davy Jones's locker let him go, And with old Neptune booze below— Bad stuff though, Neptune's mawkish brine! He'd rather touch Dundas's wine. Pitt, sir, has been a shocking steward, And made us all, poor creatures, chew hard: We scarce can put a mouse into the pot; And yet he leaves behind, I fear, Something that will not touching bear, Like powder of a post that has the rot. And Fame each day sings louder, sir, and louder, ‘State-pillars will be made of this same powder.’ Now rotten wood, according to my nouse, Is bad material to support a house. Pitt deem'd himself an eagle—what a flat! What was he?—a poor wheeling, fluttering bat— An imp of darkness—busy catching flies! Here, there, up, down, off, on—shriek, shriek—snap, snap— His gaping mouth a very lucky trap, Quick seizing for his hungry maw—supplies. Pitt makes, 'tis true, a monstrous noise— He who's seduc'd must be besotted. The sound may fright the ears of boys— A cannon's thunder, but not shotted. No farmer with more true delight E'er saw a saucy, soaring kite Fetch'd by a leaden messenger to ground, Than we, when majesty thought fit, And wisely too, to humble Pitt, Headlong into the gulf profound, Sunk him to hell—at least his lowest hell, Where pride's prick'd bladder could no longer swell. No farmer with a greater glee Beholds a dying fox than we Mark'd the last struggles of poor Billy Pitt. On every visage see a smile! Joy triumphs through the echoing isle! Upon his name Posterity shall spit. Poor banish'd Liberty again To Britain's fair and wide domain, Shall bring her throne, her sacred throne: The voice that long has learnt to mourn, Shall hail with rapture her return, And change for sounds of joy the hopeless groan. Well, sire, whatever be th' event, You do things with the best intent; Distress'd when Fortune mars a patriot plan: And know, each true-born Briton sings, ‘Health and long life to virtuous kings! We love the master, but detest the man.’ POSTSCRIPT. Sire! if your majesty so please, And, sire, it may be done with ease, I'll make a bargain.—Keep out Pitt for ever, My song shall be the song of praise; To kings an altar will I raise, And never tear it down—no, never, never. And, should it please th' Almighty to take Pye, Sire, I'm your bard—your laureat—I—yes, I! I think this must be some temptation, Considering my vast reputation. ODE III. TO LORD H?Y. Sweet is the Muse's voice to me! Nothing so clever, nought more mighty, For taking from the heart ennui, The spleen, blue devils, tædium vitæ. Sweet also is the sweet Cremona's tongue, Making the hours dance merrily along. But, ah! not sweet, indeed, to me, Are sounds in Parliament from thee: Through my whole frame such torpors creep— I stretch, gape, yawn, and fall asleep. Surely our men of worship should be wise, Think deeply, and with speech surprise: But titles only the mad million hails! Just like bird-fanciers, heedless of the song, Who ask what feathers to the birds belong, That, bashaw-like, gain glory by their tails. Thou deem'st thyself a first rate ship of war— Inform one, H?k'sb?y, art thou mad? What says each honest, grinning tar? ‘O, d?n my eyes! this is too bad!’ Then flings his quid away, and raves, ‘A goose-feather upon the waves!’ Now let me own, Jack's cat is much too smart: 'Mid the loud storm, and on the ocean's swell, H?k'sb?y, I'll tell thee truly what thou art— A simple cockle-shell! Slipp'd from a stubborn rock into the sea.— ‘Ah!’ thou exclaimest, ‘who's that stubborn rock? I wonder who that rock can be!’ Pitt! Pitt!—Lord, thou art stupid as a stock! H?k'sb?y, amid this boisterous gale, Since thou art mounted upon high, On pinion wild, with dauntless eye, Let me instruct thee with a tale. 'Tis of an owl, A solemn fowl, And very much conceited—much like thee: Excuse this quaker-proneness to be free. AN Owl, a bachelor of no great soul, Nor intellect, but very, very proud, The tenant of a little dirty hole, Wish'd from obscurity to clear the cloud: Yes, owl must have his sails unfurl'd, And mount majestic on the world. Close to his ivy-house liv'd Crow, Who on his errands us'd to go. ‘Crow,’ said the Owl, upon a day, ‘I'm sick of solitude and gloom: A bird of my deep sense and plume Should mount amid the blaze of day. In short, dear crow, I wish to wed, And, mind me, take unto my bed A bird of birth, the Eagle's daughter, Miss Eaglet!’—‘Ah!’ replied the Crow, Ready to split his sides with laughter, ‘Indeed! and are things really so? Right, sir, to alter your condition— O Lord! there's nothing like ambition!’ ‘Well, Crow, you'll quickly seek the realms above, With my proposals to the bird of Jove.’ Crow takes his leave, ascends the skies, And to the Eagle's palace flies The black ambassador from Owl; Delivers his credentials to his grace, With Auckland's diplomatic face, Conceiving, like a penetrating fowl, How politics would go above; What answer leave the bird of Jove. Thus spake the royal bird:—‘Sir Crow, To my Lord Owl be pleas'd to go, And tell him that I like the match: I'm much oblig'd to him, indeed, For honouring the Eagle breed: I've been a good while on the watch To throw a little lustre round my house: Commend me to the thunderbolt of mouse. ‘Miss Eaglet is at his command— Shall join his lordship in the straw; Who such alliance cannot well withstand; Happy to take him by the claw. Bid him ascend sans cérémonie—free, And pick his mouse to-day with me. Off flew at once the sable fowl, And quickly reach'd the house of Owl, And told him all that he had seen and heard. Owl instant comb'd, and wash'd his face, Cut all his claws to such a grace, Trimm'd all his feathers nicely—clipp'd his beard; Bid to his humble hole good-night, And rose amid the realms of light. Mounted a mile or two, behold, The sun's bright blaze of burnish'd gold Flash'd on the owl's poor weak and watering eyes; Just like a paper-kite, whose string Deserting, leaves him on the wing, To totter, dip, mount, fall again, and rise; So shuffled Owl, lost, reeling, blind, The sport of every gust of wind, Till down he fell with phiz of woe, The jest of ev'ry bird below. Now, H?k'sb?y, tell the man of rhime, How feelest thou thy flight sublime? Thy weak eyes seem already winking. Poor bird! I fear 'tis quickly over! Yes, yes, already I discover Symptoms of sinking. Pitt's mouth may make a little blast— The paper-kite comes down at last, And sharply watching are we all; And when laid flat upon the ground, Thy paper stuff we shall surround, And make us merry at thy fall! Remember Icarus's height— Perhaps the observation stings; Thou shouldst have ask'd, before thy flight, Dame Wisdom for a pair of wings. ODE IV. TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER. Pray, Mister Addington, go out— Your change on madness seems to border. You're a good school-mistress, no doubt, To keep the noisy brats in order. But to be minister!—God bless ye! Why, what the devil could possess ye? Pray, Mister Addington, go out, And let some abler man come in— Such child's play!—What are ye about? The nation's really in a grin! And yet it ought to cry, Heav'n knows! So nearly going to the crows! Good Mister Addington, go out— Go calmly out, nor make a pudder; And don't, like Grenville, push your snout Beneath the good old state-cow's udder. Poor beast! she can't thy thirst supply! Pitt's famish'd calves have suck'd her dry. And hear me, sir—learn some small wit— Don't be the dirty tool of Pitt: Think on a tale—the monkey and the cat. Chesnuts were roasting in the fire: Jack's jaws both water'd with desire; He begs Miss Puss to lend her pretty pat; Then handy, as the handiest stoker, He makes her velvet paw a poker— And stirs away at such a rate! Puss squalls—but what is that to Pug? He holds poor Miss Grimalkin snug, And gets the chesnuts from the grate: Jack grins—indulges his rogue jaws— Puss goes in mourning for her claws. Now Mister Chancellor will say I squint; That as to my surmise there's nothing in't: Now, Mister Chancellor, I call no names; But lo! the father of reform Will take you by persuasion, or by storm, And put your pretty fingers in the flames. He wants that organ in your mouth call'd tongue; And, like an organ in the house of God, With deep-ton'd energy, divinely strong, That fills with holy awe the dread abode: He wishes yours to stun Saint Stephen's sphere, And get him some ten thousand pounds a year! Yes, you must thunder for a pension! For services of high pretension; For him who, lab'ring with the happiest pains, Sav'd England's life by dashing out her brains! ODE V. TO GEORGE ROSE, ESQ. Forc'd from affairs of state, George Rose, With pretty treasury pickings, goes; In humble hut, on Scotia's plains, To feast upon his honest gains. Thus with a dainty heap of apples, With teeth and claws, a hedge-hog grapples, The epicure, and eats his fill: Yet on the heap behold him roll, And loaded steal into his hole, A golden pippin on each quill.— Thus loaded, into Scotland goes Ex-secrétaire George Hedge-hog Rose. Fed like a horse in a king's stable, George didst thou happy rise from table, As Horace says, ‘Uti conviva satur?’ I really think 'twas no such matter. Forc'd from the ven'son of the state; Forc'd to desert a well-cramm'd plate; Forc'd from the trifles, and the jelly; Forc'd from the thousand sweet nick-nackeries, Prettily made by state-cook quackeries, To fill each crevice of thy bloated belly— Looking a downright football by its tumour, I think thou gottest up in a bad humour— Yes, George, thy stomach it is such, It thinks it cannot have too much. Yet, why art thou not dubb'd a lord, To rise with lustre from the board, As title much the vulgar world bewitches? Then mayst thou seek the barren heath, Or dell, where first thou drewest breath, And blaze the jack o'-lantern of the ditches! Joan Jenkinson, and Madge, and Bet, And Peg, and Nan, a sav'ry set, Have ris'n to ladyship in this kind reign: They ride to court, obtain a smile, Make dips and curtsies all in style, And carry off kind nods from k? and q?. Now this was all old Jenky's doing, By dint of labour and court-wooing. Hast thou not too some poor relations Wishing to change their ragged stations, And on the bright court hemisphere be stars? If favour will not gain it—buy, And hoist thy cousin Joans on high, Upon the virtuous plunder of our wars. Sure, thou mayst do all this with ease, As honours are as thick as fleas, Pitching on this man's shoulder, now on that. As Heraldry has wondrous charms, Heard shall invent a coat of arms, And to a tiger turn a mangy cat. ODE VI. When Pitt was out of office push'd, What horror smote the levee mob! Mad into street of Downing rush'd His minions, always ready for a job: A most obsequious stud of hacks, Who bore him on their humble backs Through dirty lanes, through thick and thin; No matter what the object, no; When Pitt commands—it must be so; Whether to clothe the naked realm, or skin Muse, would it be too harsh to say, The tumult on that kick-out day Was mob-like at a house on fire; Where friends, amid the conflagration, With a kind thief-acceleration, Whip off the goods they guarded by desire? Unfeeling as a stone, or harder, In rush'd Lord G? to the larder, Caught up a goose for self and wife; In ran Dundas with hungry paunch, Snatch'd up a turbot and a haunch: In bounc'd Charles Long, and, with his butcher's knife, (For in the plunder he must also join), And cut off slices from a fat sirloin. In scamper'd Wyndham—‘Where's my share? I must be partner in the spoils:’ Then up he caught an old jack hare, A proper present for his toils:’ ‘I must have something,’ Canning cries, And fastens on some rich-mince pies, As dext'rous as the rest to rifle: Ecod! and he must something do For mother and for sisters too, So steals some syllabubs and trifle With a ministerial fortune by matrimony; with sinecures, &amp;c. to a large amount, squeez'd from the vitals of the nation; this modest and generous youth could not afford to yield his poor mother, Mistress Hunn, alias Mistress Reddish, alias Mistress Canning, a pittance.— No! the kingdom must be saddled with five hundred pounds a pear for her support. Such is the laudable distribution of public treasure! Such are the depositaries of the national confidence; and of such we are ordered not to complain, for fear of the impotation of jacobinism!!!. But where was Justice all the while, That things were going off in style? Poor gentlewoman! she was gagg'd and bound; Her even scales, alas! abhorr'd, In pieces broken with her sword; Nor were the fasces to be found. Such were the guardians of the state, Just like a shoal of sharks who swam in, With maws as wide as the park gate, To save (by eating us) from famine! ODE VII. Possess but faith, 'twill move a mountain; Thus says the Bible, the great fountain, The sacred fountain of immortal truth. There are who say that Billy Pitt In this dear war has shown his wit— Lord! what a statesman!—what a clever youth! Keen as the keenest eagle's view, There's nothing that he cannot do. Yes, have a portion of credulity, And claw a pyramid, you'll pull it t'ye. Credulity's a pretty sand To blind the people of the land: O yes, it blinds weak women, and weak men, Much like the sand that boys, in fun, Fire from an engine called a gun, To knock down a poor humming-bird, or wren. THE DOCTORS; A TALE. A fellow troubled with the itch (Like courtier-men) of getting rich, And learning that a doctor (not a quack), By means of a most potent pill, Did verily and truly fill Full many a time with gold his sack— Resolv'd, by pill, to make a fortune too, So set about it without more ado. Hoist but the standard, folks will come, With heads as empty as the drum. The quack puffs off his pill—none doubt him: A bumpkin came among the rest, And thus the man of pill addrest: ‘Zur, hearing what is come to pass, That your fine pill hath cur'd the king, And able to do every thing, D'ye think, zur, that 'twill make me vind my ass? I've lost my ass, zur, zo should like to try it: If this be your opinion, sur, I'll buy it.’ ‘Undoubtedly!’ the quack replied, ‘Yes, Master Hob, it should be tried:’ Then down Hob's gullet, cure or kill, The grand impostor push'd the pill. Hob paid his fee, and off he went; And trav'lling on about an hour, His bowels sore with pains were rent: Such was the pill's surprising pow'r. No longer able to contain, Hob, in a hurry left the lane: How decent!—what can decency surpass? And sought the grove—where Hob's two eyes, Wide staring, saw with huge surprise His long-ear'd servant Jack, his ass! Ye gods! how happy was the meeting! Hob kissing Jack, and Jack, Hob greeting. ‘Adzooks! a lucky pill!’ quoth Hob: ‘Yes, yes, the pill hath done the job.’ Pill grew the subject of the village tattle: At last it gain'd a heap of fame; Not only good for blind and lame, But good, too, for recovering all stray'd cattle. Now ponder well ye parents dear— Pitt's no catholicon, I fear: Pitt is a violent cathartic, Creating very grievous gripes (In butcher phrase) among our tripes, Making the stomach, head, and heart sick: Producing much evacuation Unto a poor consumptive nation, That wants restoratives called pounds, To give her strength, and heal her wounds. Though clever in his Treasury rostrum, Pitt never yet possess'd a nostrum For bringing all stray'd millions back again: The guineas he sent out, we find, Were like so many beetles blind, Rambling the Lord knows where, like show'rs of rain, Making the German regions smile, Instead of Albion's famish'd isle. THE HEDGE-HOGS; A FABLE. THE hedge-hogs in a war most fatal, A war commenc'd with the dog-nation, Like us, unlucky, losing each land-battle, And trembling all for their salvation, Agreed to furnish contribution, With patriotic resolution, As much as every hedge-hog could afford: One of the tribe, no hedge-hog sutler, An Elwes or a Sir John Cutler, And master of a comfortable hoard, Affected to be scarcely worth a crown, Therefore unable to come down. The hedge-hog council sent to let him know The tide could never be so low: ‘Enter my house, and be convinc'd,’ quoth he. The messenger stepp'd in, and pry'd about: Appearances left not a doubt— Of wealth a vestige not a soul could see: In full conviction then they left the door: ‘'Squire Hedge-hog certainly is very poor.’ As from the door, the humble door Of our 'Squire Hedge-hog all so poor, Full convinc'd, they pass'd along; A hillock of fresh earth appear'd, Seeming but very lately rear'd: This hatch'd suspicions somewhat strong. With teeth and claws they oped the mound— Where such a treasure soon was found! Forth trots the poverty-struck 'squire, Begging and praying beyond measure, They would not take away his treasure: Was sorry he had been so great a liar; ‘Was ready with his quota to the state, T'assist the war, and give the dogs their sate.’ But, no—it was against the laws: they found He could not have it—no such thing, As treasure under ground Belong'd of right unto the king. Thus was 'Squire Hedge-hog very fairly bit, Now to apply this fable to 'Squire Pitt: Pitt, canst thou say with a good grace, That thine is not a hedge-hog-case? Believe me, thou'rt not poor in purse, However thou mayst be in spirit: Thine income, for the nation's curse, Is much, I fear, beyond thy merit. The Cinque Ports, with a few remunerations, Prove to John Bull some trifling obligations, Which Wyndham cheese-parings might call; Which cheese-parings, if in my pow'r, Should, in the space of half an hour, Return to where they started, like a ball. Had justice nicely weigh'd thy true desert, What had she giv'n?—I'll tell thee what— The dame had giv'n, to please thy lofty heart, Just half enough to feed a rat: An animal of vicious nature, Who, after breakfasting, and dining, And supping in a house, and undermining, Leaves it a prey to fire and water (As soon as all the plunder ceases), To tear it in a thousand pieces. ODE VIII. TO PITT. ‘Blessed are those who nought expect, For they shall not be disappointed;’ But thou didst hope a grand effect— Great sighings from the Lord's anointed. Strong was thy hope that majesty would send, Of terror full, to his good friend Of Downing Street post-haste away, Petitioning—‘Pitt, all is over, ‘The French will quickly land at Dover, And no one to oppose and slay: Of strength thou art a mighty tow'r: Come, come, and all thy thunder pour; Without thee, England meets her fate— Haste, haste, and save a sinking state!’ Such were a very flattering sound! How had the echoes rung around! But no such voice, alas! was ever heard! No thunder roll'd, no tempest blew; But easy quite as an old shoe, Saint James's for thy loss appear'd. Soft as a cat's, indeed, was thy retreat, That moves down stairs upon her velvet feet. But prithee swallow, Pitt, a question, That mayn't agree with thy digestion: Where was the blush, the blush of shame, When, to exalt the blind and lame, Thou gav'st of eloquence that dainty dish? Yet people will in answer say, ‘'Tis the world's way— We never hear a man cry, “Stinking fish A few of his fellow-labourers in the political vineyard, that remained after his expulsion. Mr. Pitt's eulogium on those rags of his administration produced a universal smile, even from his own party.!”’ TO PITT, IN CONTINUATION. 'TIS whisper'd thou wert turn'd to door, Most Job-like, very, very poor. Poor man! poor man! ah, what a pity! Farewell to dinners in the city! Farewell to grocers ev'ry one— Othello's occupation's gone! Yet greater men than thee have fall'n from glory: Witness the following little story. THE SULTAN AND THE DOG. A MIGHTY sultan of the east, On ev'ry dainty used to feast: (How different from the beggar and his bone!) Who drank, too, Burgundy, I ween; For ev'ry thing in style was seen, Becoming one who sat upon a throne. It chanc'd that war, all-pow'rful war, So apt the wisest schemes to mar, And change the master to the humble slave. Fix'd on the sultan his steel claws, Clapp'd an embargo on his jaws, And words, hard words, instead of victuals, gave. The king was beat—to prison sent, in short— Coarse was his fare, the coarsest sort: A jug of milk was sent to him for dinner: Enter a dog, who, while the king Was musing on some lofty thing, Stole slily to the milk, the thievish sinner; Forc'd in his head, and lapp'd each drop, no doubt, But could not get his head felonious out. So off, with his jugg'd jowl, the rascal ran. The monarch, smiling, mark'd the theft, And of his dinner though bereft, With much good-humour thus began: ‘Fortune's a fickle dame: but yesterday A hundred camels scarce could bear My quantities of kitchen-ware, And now a cur can carry it away!’ OH, with a disposition soft as silk, So humble, affable, and mild; Art thou reduc'd, too, to a jug of milk, Sweet Nature's child? Speak—Did the famish'd wolves, alas! Eat all the flesh of the dead ass, And leave thee nothing but the bones? Say, hadst thou not the face to mump One steak, from the poor nation's rump, To calm gaunt Famine's hollow moans? Ah, me! we all are very poor; Tax'd to the very eyes, I'm sure! Where is the article that pays no duty? Nought 'scapes!—not woman's fascinating beauty! Lo, many a little charming Phillis, For vending roses sweet and lilies, And love-inspiring, luscious, balmy kisses; Although the growth of their own cheek; Although the growth of their own neck; Although the growth of their own lip, sweet Misses; Are forc'd to bridewell's horrid fare, For dealing in unlicens'd ware— Spoil'd all their pretty hops, and skips, and glee, Because the justice had not got his fee. ODE IX. TO PITT AGAIN. Say, Pitt, dost thou so easy part With pow'r, the idol of thy heart, And, philosophic, yield to thy disgrace; Leave Downing Street and stately rooms, For secrecy and spectre glooms Of solitary, poor Park Place; To live within a little hole, As melancholy as a mole? Thou thoughtest we should all wear mourning, Black, weeping all for thy returning— All with white handkerchiefs to catch wet sorrow: Ah! know there are not ten who care Five farthings were they now to hear That thou wert in a jail to-morrow. Pitt, thou hast been in office long enough: Yes, thou hast had a handsome swing; Thy hide, too, like a bull-hide tough, Has met, indeed, with many a sting, Or dart, that must have kill'd all but the man Whose modesty not only took our flour (The conscientious miller of the hour), But made its bow, too, to the bran: Nay ready, too, upon its back, To carry off the very sack! Suspended on a bit of steel, Employ'd in sniggling, A large and slippery eel, The world seems glad to see thee wriggling. How hast thou work'd for life and soul, To slip again into thy hole! Aye, gape, and writhe, and spread thy fin, Poor Master Fish, you won't get in. A bungling chemist, thou hast manag'd badly; Manag'd the state-alembic sadly, With all thy cunning and thy pains: The finer parts are off! in air! Howe'er thine ignorance may stare, And nought but caput mortuum remains. So much, Pitt, for our sublimed constitution, The subject of thy fierce and ceaseless fires! And, lo, by dint of time and resolution, Thou hast well crucibled thy country 'squires; And Mother Bank, the blindest of old crones, Extracting heaps of gold from stocks and stones. When ye began this righteous war, Where was your tutelary star? Ye never dreamt of danger till too late. ‘A war with France! oh, that's soon o'er; A fox-chase, fox-chase, nothing more; Fun, fun—just coursing a poor hare, or cat.’ Such was your speech: but, sir, it doth appear, That this same cat is now become a bear, Whose claws have lately held you snug, And giv'n a cursed Cornish hug. ODE X. TO HENRY DUNDAS, ESQ. For a great empire, fast undoing, Something, indeed should have been brewing, Better than brandy and strong beer: Something was wanting, to my humble thinking, Besides good eating and hard drinking, To keep the leaky ship from foundering clear: Yet 'tis well known that e'er the vessel's sunk, The sailors commonly get drunk. Now thou art off, I long to see, In thine own language, ‘Wha wants me?’ It will not be at all surprising To catch thee, Harry, advertising. If mad to face a second storm, Take an advertisement in form. ADVERTISEMENT A steady man, near sixty years of age, Would very willingly engage As butler to a minister of state, And overlook the plate. But should the plate by chance be carried off, And not a hogshead or a bottle left; He begs to say, he won't be fool enough To answer for the leakage, or the theft. If wanted, he can have, by God's good grace, An exc'llent character from his last place. Please to direct to Mister H. Dundas, At the old sign—the Bottle and the Glass. A MORAL CONCLUSION. In this world's wild, uncertain chase, What strange events at times take place! Some bright with joy, some black with sorrow! Omnium est rerum vicissitudo! To day what wonders I and you do, That happen not again to-morrow! Hawkesb'ry, and Wyndham, Canning, Long, Were under-strappers to Will Pitt; Forerunners, oft they gave their tongue Before the great man pour'd his wit. Thus Paul's four small clock-quarters ('prentice boys) Instruct their mighty master when to sound: Paul solemn listens to the tinkling noise, Then breaks in thunder to the world around! But herald under-strappers now no more, Pitt out of office, the broad farce is o'er; Flung from his pedestal amid the rabble, Deep-thundering Pitt is—poor old Goody Gabble. Ah me! sic transit gloria mundi— Such things will be till moon and sun die, And earth our ashes, our pale embers cover: And really, when we sum up all, What's life?—A blast—a little squall.— Death's calm must come at last, and all is over— All in our tombs in peace—not one To read ‘Hic jacet’ on the stone!

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. TALES OF THE HOY; INTERSPERSED WITH SONG, ODE, AND DIALOGUE. [Verse extracted from the prose narrative.] ???????? ??? ?? ??????, ?????? ?? ?????? ?????, ??????? ?? ?????? ?????. ANACREON. The Muses love thee dearly, Peter, And eke the merry God of Metre, Who gracious gave thee such a charming tongue: We thought that age had quench'd thy fire, Or law's rude hammer crush'd thy lyre, Or royal whisper sooth'd the rage of Song; Or pension chang'd thy harp's uncourtly strings, And with her golden scissars clipp'd thy wings. ['Twas in that month when Nature drear] 'Twas in that month when Nature drear, With sorrow whimpering, drops a tear, To find that Winter, with a savage sway, Prepares to leave his hall of storms, And crush her flow'rs' delightful forms, And banish Summer's poor last lingering ray; 'Twas in that season when the men of slop, The Jew and Gentile turn towards their shop, In alleys dark of London's ample round; From Margate's handsome spot, and Hooper's-Hill, And Dandelion, where, with much good-will, Of butter'd rolls they swallow'd many a pound; I too, the bard, from Thanet's pleasant isle, Where, at a lodging-house, I liv'd in style, Prepar'd with Gentile and with Jew to wander; So pack'd up all my little odds and ends; Took silent leave of all my Margate friends, And sought a gallant vessel's great commander; Who, proud of empire, rul'd with conscious joy His wooden kingdom, call'd a Margate Hoy! Lord! how my gaping readers long to know, Which gallant vessel's valiant lord (A natural curiosity, I trow!) Hail'd the great poet and his trunk on board! If Kydd, who nicks the passage to an inch, Or he, his high and mighty rival, Finch. THE PRAISE OF MARGATE. Dear Margate, with a tear I quit this isle, Where all seem happy—sweethearts, husbands, spouses: On ev'ry cheek, where pleasure plants a smile, And plenty furnishes the people's houses. What's Brighton, when to thee compar'd!—poor thing; Whose barren hills in mist for ever weep; Or what is Weymouth, though a queen and king Wash, walk, and prattle there, and wake and sleep? Go bid the whiting's, the boil'd whiting's eye, In brightness with the gem of Ind compare; Or bid the skipping jack-o'-lantern vie With heav'n's keen flash that lights the realms of air: Go bid the humble thorn, the cedars ape, That to the stars their tops sublimely spread; Go bid a curate in his tatter'd crape, Like Doctor Porteus lift the lofty head. Bid Rose's A great man, who deemed it politically necessary to create a couple of newspapers to vouch for his good deeds, and varnish others. The consumptive state of his two miserable bantlings, which George weakly imagined would prove to be a pair of Atlasses to support his world of character, gave birth to the following Ode of Condolence. Sun like Sol with lustre shine; Or bid that thing, misnomer'd the True Briton, Like brother papers, yield a decent line— Poor dying imps, whom Truth and Genius spit on. AN ODE OF CONDOLENCE TO GEORGE ROSE, ESQ. On his two Newspapers, most unfortunately baptized ‘The Sun,’ and ‘The True Briton.’ FORBEAR thee, George, such whining, puling, sighing, Because thy poor consumptive brats are dying— By thee begotten,—how could they be strong? So very like thyself in all their features! Unhappy, miserable, dismal creatures, The world now wonders they have liv'd so long. What but insanity could well expect Perfection from such radical defect? What too thy reputation's wing will raise, And with a bush of laurel deck thy name; Lo! I, the sweetest bard of modern days, Admiring, turn the Stentor of thy fame. [Whate'er from dirty Thames to Margate goes] Whate'er from dirty Thames to Margate goes; However foul, immediately turns fair! Whatever filth offends the London nose, Acquires a fragrance soon from Margate air. Ev'n Rose's news-hunters, his scandal-crimps, Are chang'd to wits, so great are Margate-pow'rs; Yes! his poor trumpeters, the noisy imps, Become sweet Philomels, in Margate bow'rs! The tailor here, the port of Mars assumes: Who cross-legg'd sat in silence on his board— Forgets his goose, and rag-besprinkled rooms, And thread and thimble, and now struts a lord! A sow's ear cannot make a purse of silk; We cannot to a whale convert the shrimp. What folly too to put out each poor imp To nurses yielding not one drop of milk. Then prithee for thy papers sigh no more— So worthless, for oblivion they are ripe; Peace to their slumber, as their date is o'er— Peace to their ashes, as they light my pipe. Here Crispin too forgets his end, and awl— Here Mistress Cleaver with importance looks; Forgets the beef and mutton on her stall, And lights and livers dangling from the hooks. Here Mistress Tap, from pewter pots withdrawn, Walks forth in all the pride of paunch and geer; Mounts her swoln heels on Dandelion's lawn, And at the ball-room heaves her heavy rear. Chang'd by their travels—mounted high in soul, Here Suds forgets whate'er remembrance shocks; And Mistress Suds forgetteth too the pole, Wigs, bob and pigtail, basons, razors, blocks! Here too the most important Dicky Dab With puppy-pertness, pretty, pleasant prig Forgets the narrow, fishy house of crab, And drives in Jehu-style his whirling gig! And here 'midst all such consequence am I The poet! semper idem—just the same— Bidding old Satire's hawk at follies fly, To fill the shops of booksellers with game. [Now, as our immortal Milton sublimely would have sung:] With dewy gems adorning herb and flow'r, Mov'd meek-eyed Evening on the western hills With modest mien, and on the calm expanse Of ocean's mirror look'd, and looking ting'd Its heaving bosom with a roseate blush; A blush empyreal!— [Or, as the no less immortal author of Hudibras would have quaintly said;] ‘Now Madam Eve, with gown of pink, Stepp'd down to Neptune's tap to drink, Where Phœbus just before had been At his old fam'd salt-water inn (To end the labours of the day), And give his horses, oats, and hay, And bed, and clear their hoofs from gravel, To fit them for next morning's travel.’ [Again, as the illustrious Butler would have said, or sung:] Night, in her weeds, with bats and owls (Her usual equipage of fowls) Came forth! and changing colour, day, (According to her vulgar way) Like healthy felon's hang'd, alack! Turn'd from deep red to dismal black. [Thus oft it happens that the sky] Thus oft it happens that the sky Throws horrid glooms upon the eye; Breeds clouds like malkins—old, black rags indeed! The lands below look dismal, drear! When suddenly, see Sol appear! He pushes boldly through the dark, his head! At once the shadows to his glories yield, And cheerful radiance flies from field to field. SONG. [AGAIN we begin to be Britons, my boys] AGAIN we begin to be Britons, my boys: While united, success we command:— Lo! each tar on the ocean a triumph enjoys, And laurels shall cover the land. Though surrounded by foes that in legions arise, And cry for our ruin aloud, The Genius of England their fury defies, And bursts like the sun from a cloud! May the king live for ever, the friend of our isle, That revolts at the name of a slave; Whose eye for fair Merit possesses a smile, And a tear for the tomb of the brave! No man to his mistress or wife will return, And say:—‘I have fled from the foe; My honour is gone, in the grave let me mourn A disgrace that no Briton should know.’ France, the beggar shall be of the year fifty-eight, When for mercy she put up her pray'r; With nought but her perfidy left, and her spite, And her pride, to console her despair. The Spaniard too late shall his folly confess, When his Indies no longer remain; And the Dutchman, a frog in the days of Queen Bess, Shall croak in his ditches again. But how needless to talk of our prowess in war, And proclaim what a universe knows! Let Langara, De Grasse, and De Winter, declare What it is to have Britons for foes! CORINNA'S EPITAPH. HERE sleeps what was innocence once, but its snows Were sullied and trod with disdain; Here lies what was beauty, but pluck'd was its rose, And flung like a weed to the plain. O pilgrim, look down on her grave with a sigh, Who fell the sad victim of art; Ev'n Cruelty's self must bid her hard eye A pearl of compassion impart. Ah! think not, ye prudes, that a sigh, or a tear, Can offend of all Nature the God; Lo! Virtue already has mourn'd at her bier, And the lily will bloom on her sod. SONG. [WHEN William first woo'd, I said yes to the swain] WHEN William first woo'd, I said yes to the swain, And made him as blest as a lord— For ye virgins around, in my speech to be plain, That no is a dangerous word! The girl that will always say no, I'm afraid, Is doom'd by her planet to die an old maid. The gentlemen seem one and all to agree, That we're made of materials for kissing— And if so, for I really believe it, good me! What joys through one no might be missing! Since the girl who will always say no, I'm afraid, Is doom'd by her planet to die an old maid. Say yes, and of courtship ye finish the toil— Whole mountains at once ye remove— You brighten the eyes of the swain by a smile, For smiles are the sunshine of love? Say yes, and the world will acquit you of art, Since the tongue will not then give the lie to the heart. THE WIDOW OF EPHESUS; A TALE. BALM are the sighs for breathless husbands shed! And pearl the eye-drops that adorn the dead! At Ephesus (a handsome town of Greece) There liv'd a lady—a most lovely piece! In short, the charming toast of all the town: In wedlock's velvet bonds had liv'd the dame— Yes! brightly did the torch of Hymen flame, When Death, too cruel, knock'd her husband down. This was indeed a lamentable stroke! Prudentia's gentle heart was nearly broke! Tears, pea-like trickle, shrieks her face deform— Sighs, sighs succeeding, leave her snowy breast— Winds, call'd hysterical, expand her chest, As though she really had devour'd a storm. Now, fainting, calls she on her poor dead love, How like the wailings of the widow'd dove! All Ephesus upon the wonder gaz'd! Men, women, children, really were amaz'd. 'Tis true, a few old maids abus'd the pother— ‘Heav'ns! if one husband dies, why take another!’ Said they—contemptuous cocking up their nose: ‘Ridiculous enough! and what about? To make for a dead husband such a rout! There are as fine as he, one might suppose. ‘A body would presume, by grief so mad, Another husband was not to be had; But men are not so very scarce indeed— More than are good, there are, God mend the breed!’ Such was the conversation of old maids, Upon this husband's visit to the shades. At length her spouse was carried to the tomb, Where poor Prudentia mop'd amid the gloom. One little lamp, with solitary beam, Show'd the dark coffin that contain'd her dear, And gave a beauteous sparkle to each tear, That rill-like dropp'd—or rather like a stream. Resolv'd was she amid this tomb to sigh: To weep, and wail, and groan, and starve, and die— No comfort! no! no comfort would she take: Her friends beheld her anguish with great pain, Begg'd her to try amusement, but in vain— ‘No! she would perish, perish for his sake!’ Her flaxen tresses all dishevell'd flow'd— Her vestments loose—her tucker all abroad, Revealing such fair swelling orbs of woe! Her lids in swimming grief, now look'd on high, Now downward droop'd, and now she pour'd a sigh How tuneful, on her dear pale spouse below. Who would not covet death for such sweet sighs, And be bewail'd by such a pair of eyes? It happen'd that a rogue condemn'd to death, Resign'd (to please the law) his roguish breath; And near the vault did this same felon swing: For fear the rogue's relations, or a friend, Might steal him from the rope's disgraceful end, A smart young soldier watch'd the thief and string. This son of Mars, upon his silent station, Hearing, at night, a dismal lamentation, Stole to the place of woe—that is, the tomb— And, peeping in, beheld a beauteous face That look'd with such a charming tragic grace, Displaying sorrow for a husband's doom. The youth most nat'rally express'd surprise, And scarcely could he credit his two eyes: ‘Good God, ma'am!—pray, ma'am, what's the matter here? Sweet ma'am be comforted—you must, you shall! At times misfortunes, ev'n the best, befall— Pray stop your grief, ma'am, save that precious tear.’ ‘Go, soldier, leave me!’ sigh'd the fair again, In such a melting melancholy strain, Casting her eyes of woe upon the youth— ‘I cannot, will not live without my love!’ And then she threw her glist'ning eyes above, That swam in tears of constancy and truth. ‘Madam!’ rejoin'd the youth, and press'd her hand, ‘Indeed you shall not my advice withstand; For Heav'n's sake don't stay here to weep and howl! Pray take refreshment!’ Off at once he set, And quickly brought the mourner drink and meat; A bottle of Madeira, and a fowl; And bread and beer, Her heart to cheer. ‘Ah! gentle youth, you bid me eat in vain! Leave me! oh, leave me, soldier, to complain! Yes, sympathizing youth, withdraw your wine! My sighs and tears shall be my only food— Thou knewest not my husband kind and good, For whom this heart shall ever, ever pine!’ And then she cast upon the youth an eye All tender! saying, ‘Soldier, let me die!’ And then she press'd his hand with friendship warm. ‘You shall not die, by Heav'n!’ the soldier swore; ‘No! to the world such beauty I'll restore, And give it back again its only charm!’ Such was th' effect of her delicious hand, That charm'd his senses like a wizard's wand; ‘What! howl for ever for a breathless clod! Ma'am, you shall eat a leg of fowl, by G?!’ With that he clapp'd wine, fowl, bread, beer and all, Without more ceremony, on the pall. ‘Well, soldier, if you do insist,’ quoth she, All in a saint-like, sweet, complying tone, ‘I'll try if Grief will let me pick a bone! Your health, sir.’—‘Thank you kindly, ma'am,’ quoth he. As grief absorbs the senses, the fair dame Scarce knew that she was eating, or yet drinking; So hard is it a roaring grief to tame, And keep the sighing, pensive soul from thinking. So that the fowl and wine soon pass'd indeed— Quickly away too stole the beer and bread All down her pretty little swelling throat: And now, whate'er philosophers may think, Sorrow is much oblig'd to meat and drink, Whose soothing virtues stop the plaintive note; And, says the anatomic art, ‘The stomach's very near the heart.’ Prudentia found it so: a gentler sigh Stole from her lovely breast—a smaller tear, Containing less of anguish, did appear Within the pretty corner of her eye; Her eye's dark cloud dispersing too apace (Just like a cloud that oft conceals the moon), Let out a brighter lustre o'er her face, Seeming to indicate dry weather soon. Her tongue too somewhat lost its mournful style; Her rosebud-lips expanded with a smile; Which pleas'd the gallant soldier, to be sure— Happy to think he sav'd the dame from death— Yes, from his hug preserv'd the sweetest breath, And to a wounded heart prescrib'd a cure. Now Mars's son a minute left the dame, To see if all went well with rogue and rope; But ere he to the fatal gibbet came, The knave had deem'd it proper to elope. In short, attendance on the lady's grief Had lost him his companion, the hang'd thief, Whose friends had kindly filch'd him from the string. Quick to the lady did the soldier run: ‘Madam, I shall be hang'd, as sure's a gun! O Lord! the thief's gone off, and I shall swing! ‘Madam, it was the royal declaration, That if the rogue was carried off, Whether by soft means or by rough— No matter—I should take his situation. ‘O Lord, O Lord! my fate's decreed! O ma'am, I shall be hang'd, indeed! ‘O Lord! O Lord! this comes of creeping To graves and tombs—this comes of peeping— This is th' effect of running from my duty! O curse my folly! What an ape Was I, to let the thief escape! This comes of fowl, and wine, and beer, and beauty! ‘Yet, ma'am, I beg your pardon too, Since if I'm hang'd, 'twill be for you!’ ‘Cheer up my gallant friend,’ reply'd the dame, Squeezing his hand and smoothing down his face— ‘No, no, you sha'nt be hang'd, nor come to shame, My husband here shall take the fellow's place— Nought but a lump of clay can he be counted! Then let him mount’—and, lo! the corpse was mounted; Made a good thief—nay, so complete, The people never smelt the cheat. Now from the gibbet to the tomb again, Haste, arm-in-arm, the soldier and the fair; T'exchange for kisses, and the turtle's strain, Sad hymns of death and ditties of despair. THE DRUNKEN FLY. POOR little reeling, thoughtless soul, To tumble drunk into the bowl! Death to thy thread had clapp'd his knife; Go, wipe thy nose, and wings, and thighs, And brighten up thy maudling eyes, And thank the captain for thy life! In future, get not quite so drunk! Thy girl, perhaps, a lass of spunk, May wish thy amorous pow'rs to prove; And shouldst thou, drunk, the wanton chase, Ebriety may bring disgrace; And who would look a fool in love? VERSES ON A FLY That pitched on the Cheek of a most beautiful young Lady. BY LORD SALISBURY. HAPPY, happy, happy fly! Were I you, and you were I! But you will always be a fly, And I remain Lord Salisbury! Verses on the Fall of the Statue of Apollo from the Summit of the Organ, on the Head of Shield, as he was playing. ON a day, on Shield's crown, Apollo leap'd down, And, lo! like a bullock he fell'd him! Now was not this odd? Not at all—for the god Was mad that a mortal excell'd him! POOR TOM. NOW the rage of battle ended, And the French for mercy call; Death no more in smoke and thunder, Rode upon the vengeful ball. Yet, what brave and loyal heroes Saw the sun of morning bright— Ah! condemn'd by cruel Fortune Ne'er to see the star of night. From the main-deck to the quarter Strew'd with limbs and wet with blood, Poor Tom Halliard, pale and wounded, Crawl'd where his brave captain stood. ‘O, my noble captain! tell me, Ere I'm borne a corpse away, Have I done a seaman's duty On this great and glorious day? ‘Tell a dying sailor truly, For my life is fleeting fast; Have I done a seaman's duty? Can there aught my mem'ry blast?’ ‘Ah! brave Tom!’ the captain answer'd, ‘Thou a sailor's part hast done, I revere thy wounds with sorrow— Wounds by which our glory's won.’ ‘Thanks, my captain! life is ebbing Fast from this deep-wounded heart; But, O grant one little favour, Ere I from the world depart: ‘Bid some kind and trusty sailor, When I'm number'd with the dead, For my dear and constant Catherine, Cut a lock from this poor head! ‘Bid him to my Catherine give it, Saying, hers alone I die! Kate will keep the mournful present, And embalm it with a sigh. ‘Bid him too this letter bear her, Which I've penn'd with panting breath: Kate may ponder on the writing, When the hand is cold in death.’ ‘That I will,’ replied the captain, ‘And be ever Catherine's friend.’ ‘Ah! my good and kind commander, Now my pains and sorrows end!’ Mute towards his captain weeping, Tom uprais'd a thankful eye— Grateful then, his foot embracing, Sunk, with Kate on his last sigh! Who, that saw a scene so mournful, Could without a tear depart? He must own a savage nature— Pity never warm'd his heart! Now in his white hammock shrouded, By the kind and pensive crew, As he dropp'd into the ocean, All burst out—‘Poor Tom, adieu!’ THE SHEPHERD'S PIPE. LO! the pipe of poor Colin, mute, mute, how it lies! No more to be swelled by his hopes, or his sighs! ‘Go, leave me!’ said he, ‘since unpriz'd by the fair.’ Then he wistfully flung it away in despair. Who, like Colin, could give it of rapture the sound, Which the echoes with rapture repeated around? Or give it, like Colin, a soul to complain? And who like the shepherd e'er gave it in vain? 'Twas here, at the peep of the morn, that he stray'd To sooth with its music the ear of the maid! 'Twas here that he wak'd its sweet voice, to delight (Not Philomel's sweeter!) her slumber at night. But vain were his vows, and the voice of his reed; The heart of poor Colin was fated to bleed! See his grave! near yon tree his pale relics are laid, 'Mid the bow'r that he planted, of silence and shade. Ah! blame not the nymph who was deaf to his tale, Since her heart was betroth'd to a youth of the vale. Come, virgins, we'll gather the flow'rs of the grove, And strew on the victim of Sorrow and Love. [Thus, as the flocks amid the valley feed] Thus, as the flocks amid the valley feed, Behold! the bellwether, the rover, Like mortals, fickle, takes it in his head To taste a neighbouring field of clover! He dares th' opposing hedge, he beats it hollow— Mounts, leaps, and all the tribes of fleeces follow! TEARS AND SMILES; A MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION OF POEMS. Omnis Aristippum decuit color. —HOR. JULIA; OR, THE VICTIM OF LOVE: A PASTORAL BALLAD. Illa mihi sancta est; illius dona sepulchro, Et madefacta meis serta feram lacrymis. TIBULLUS. From mem'ry nought shall force her form away, For ever sacred and for ever dear: I'll seek her tomb at morn and closing day, And wet each flow'r I offer with a tear. She is dead, who gave life to the groves, And covers our valley with gloom! She who led all the Pleasures and Loves, Now joins the pale band of the tomb. She whose beauty commanded the heart, So prais'd, so ador'd, so desir'd; Sunk, the innocent victim of art, And the passion her beauty inspir'd, Yet silent was she on the swain Whose cruelty doom'd her to mourn; In secret her soul would complain, In secret her anguish would burn. Though faint was the blush on her cheek, And deep in her bosom the thorn; A smile 'midst her sorrows would break, Like a ray through the clouds of the morn. She would sit near yon willow and sigh, And pant in the shade of the trees: ‘Sweet Zephyr, bring health,’ she would cry; But Health never came with the breeze. And oft she would drink of the brook, But Health never came with the rill; Then around on the heights she would look, But Health never came to the hill. On her dog she look'd down with a tear, And sigh'd, as she patted his head, ‘Poor Fidelle! thou wilt suffer, I fear, When thy mistress, who loves thee is dead. ‘Thou hast ever been constant and kind; My fondness ne'er met with a slight: In thee a firm friendship I find; How unhappy when out of my sight! ‘When with speed I could travel the plain, With thy mistress to sport was thy pride; And now I am weak and in pain, Thou art heartless and dull by my side. ‘When I'm gone, thou, poor fellow, wilt pine, And seek me, uneasy, around; Beseeching the swains, with a whine, To tell where thy friend may be found. ‘Shouldst thou find my cold dwelling at last, Near my sod thou wilt mope the long day: Nor the night, nor the rain, nor the blast, Nay, nor hunger will force thee away.’ Thus she spoke to her fav'rite, whose eye Was fix'd upon those of the maid: Then he lick'd her fond hand at her sigh, As if conscious of all she had said! Sweet nymph! what a sudden decay! Now her limbs she could scarcely sustain; Now her head would sink feebly away, Like the lily press'd down by the rain. At length on her pillow she fell; In silence we watch'd her last breath: When she bade us for ever farewell, How divine, though the whisper of Death! No struggle in dying she knew, Life pass'd with such sweetness away! So calm from the world she withdrew, Her last sigh seem'd the zephyr of May. Beneath a plain stone she is laid, For needless of praise is the tale; Since the virtues that shone in the maid, May be seen in the tears of the vale. ELEGY I. He despairs of obtaining the Smiles of his Mistress. What are the thunders of the ruthless wind? And what the billows that tumultuous roll? Calms to the raging tempest of my mind,— Rills to the restless surges of my soul. Intent to please, I vainly urge my toil; No hopes, alas! the virgin's looks impart: O tell me, Julia, what can win thy smile? O speak, and heave the mountain from my heart. What can I do to win a cruel maid? The front of Danger willing would I brave: No coward terror can this heart invade, Whose chiefest glory is to be thy slave Fate holds no horror while I please my fair; Then, Julia, bid me my fond passion prove: All, all thy rigour can command I dare, But lose thine image, and forget to love. ELEGY II. Instead of composing for Fame, he resolves to write the praises of Julia. No more I'll idly pour the line for praise: Far loftier hopes my glowing fancy move I ask the muses for their sweetest lays, To tell a beauteous maid how much I love. Vain are our vows to Fame! alas, how vain! She waits to see us on the mournful bier Before she yields of eulogy the strain, What cruel mockery to the lifeless ear! To Julia's hand I own my wish aspires: Mean are my merits—her's how far above Yet can I boast what only she requires, A heart to guard her, and a soul to love. Though courts admir'd, the modest Julia chose The silent shade, remote from public view: How like the berry that in secret glows, And hides beneath a leaf its blushful hue! Few are the wishes of the constant pair: What though no gold their humble cot display; Content, their guest, thus cries with careless air, ‘Go, leave us, Wealth, and palaces emblaze.’ In rural bowers Content delights to dwell; To cull the sweets of Nature's simple vale; To join the hermit in the mossy cell, And join the nymphs and shepherds of the dale. To Fortune's tinsel shrine let others bow, And to their wishes rear the golden pile; To one fair virgin while I breathe my vow, And let my only treasure be her smile. ELEGY III. He complains of Julia's not keeping her Appointment to meet him. What demons keep my soul's delight away, And cruel thus my fondest wish invade? Alas! I tremble at the setting ray! Pale evening waves around an envious shade! How expectation loads th' important hour! Impatience wilder with each moment grows! Thou loit'ring fair-one, bless th' appointed bow'r, And snatch thy lover from a thousand woes. From vale to vale my eager gaze I strain; From glade to glade with wild emotion move Now turn and sigh, now move and turn again, Devour each sound, and chide my ling'ring love Desponding, now upon the ground I lie, And, anxious, murmur to the desert air; Now call on slumber to my closing eye; But slumber lights not on the lids of care. Dark as the bosom of the stormy deep, Wild as its waves my thoughts succeeding roll; Cool reason vainly soothes the wretch to sleep— Oh! what is reason to the love-sick soul? Ye sweet companions of my lonely bow'r, Whose simple melodies my shades inspire: Oh, that my bosom felt your happy hour! Oh, that my voice could join your cheerful choir! Light as your wing that skims the midway sky, From joy to joy my heart so lately flew: With me my moments never left a sigh, Nor bath'd my lids in sorrow's baleful dew. Hate to the nymph I vow, and cold disdain: Yet at each idle sound alarm'd, I start; To meet her, panting, every nerve I strain, And show too plain her triumph o'er my heart. Where is my love? alas! my transports die: My cheek, that redden'd with despair, turns pale; With disappointment drops my clouded eye, Each pining feature tells a mournful tale. See, see, the sun descends beneath the deep; Behold the melancholy bird of night!— In vain along the winding gloom I weep, And wish in vain to stay the parting light. ELEGY IV. Disappointed at not meeting Julia, he accuses her of Inconstancy. Faint as the lustre of a lonely star, That sheds through night's abyss his distant fire, Hope feebly glimmer'd on my heart's despair: Behold, behold, at length her lamp expire! Know, lovely virgin, thy deluding art Hath lodg'd a thousand scorpions in my breast. Oh, say what happier rival wins thy heart? Say, am I there no more a welcome guest? To a false fair-one have I told my tale? For a false fair-one fondly sigh'd so long? Why, dear deceiver, did thy charms prevail? Thy charms the subject of my ev'ry song. Ye swains who heard so oft my raptur'd lays, False is the damsel that your wonder drew; Ye nymphs who listen'd to the lavish'd praise, My soul's soft idol proves at length untrue. Nymphs of the vale, for me your pity spare; Let not my fate, ye swains, your pity draw: Alas! for faithless beauty drop the tear, And grieve so fair a diamond holds a flaw. Can Falsehood's stain that dove-like heart defile? Ah, see the tear by blushing Honour shed! Lurks perfidy beneath that heavenly smile? See Love with horror mark the guilty maid. Yet, yet the tyrant of my breast she reigns: Restless for her it heaves with constant sighs; My wounded heart of cruelty complains, Yet softly pleads her pardon while it dies. ELEGY V. He condemns the Licentiousness of the Age. To false delights the youth of Britain fly, Who court for happiness the wanton's arms; Who darts on all the fond inflaming eye, And choiceless yields to all, for gold, her charms. When in the Syren's fond embrace you sigh, And on her lip impress the burning kiss, Doth friendship mingle with th' unhallow'd joy, Or Love's pure spirit swell the surge of bliss? When droops enjoyment, what is then the fair? A flow'r that blooms, but quickly doom'd to fade; A sun that pours a momentary glare, And 'mid the tempest sinks o'erwhelm'd in shade. O swains, to Modesty's fair daughters turn: By mental beauty let your hearts be led: Bid by your flight the venal fair-one mourn, And press in tears her solitary bed. When round your neck her fondling arms she glues, And, bent to please, exhausts each winning art; With false delights she shamefully subdues, And leads the passions captive, not the heart. Their midnight orgies whilst they madly hold, I of a tender maid shall be possest: What bliss her tender beauties to enfold, And sooth my slumbers on her faithful breast! Time from her bosom all its snows may steal, His iron hand her cheeks' pure blush invade, Still to my Julia will I fondly kneel, And love her most when all her roses fade. Who spurns the weeping fair-one from his breast, Hard is his heart—in ev'ry virtue poor: Hard is his heart to wound the fair distrest, Who sighs that she can charm his eye no more. Cruel to bid with grief her bosom heave, Because her cheeks no longer glowing warms: Base, to forget the joys her beauty gave— And oh, forget it faded in his arms! SONG. [From her, whose ev'ry smile is love] From her, whose ev'ry smile is love, I haste to some far distant cell: My sighs too weak the maid to move, I bid the flatterer Hope farewell. Yet, as I quit her vale, my sighs At ev'ry step for Julia mourn; My anxious heart within me dies, And, panting, whispers, ‘O return.’ Deluded heart! thy folly know, Nor fondly nurse a fatal flame: By absence thou wilt lose thy woe, And only flutter at her name. SONG. [O summer, thy presence gives warmth to the vale] O summer, thy presence gives warmth to the vale; The song of the warbler enlivens the grove; The pipe of the shepherd too gladdens the gale: Alas! but I hear not the voice of my love. The lilies appear in their fairest array; To the valleys the woodbines a fragrance impart; The roses the pride of their blushes display; Alas! but I meet not the nymph of my heart. Go, shepherds, and bring the sweet wanderer here, The boast of her sex, and delight of the swains; Go, Zephyr, and whisper this truth in her ear, That the Pleasures with Julia are fled from the plains. If thus to the maid thou my wishes declare, To the cot she has left she will quickly return; Too soft is her bosom to give us despair, That sooner would sigh than another's should mourn. SONG. ON JULIA. Ere 'witching Love my heart possest, And bade my sighs the nymph pursue Calm as the infant's smiling rest, No anxious hope nor fear it knew. But doom'd, ah! doom'd at last to mourn, What tumults in that heart arose! An ocean tumbling wild, and torn By tempests from its deep repose. Yet let me not the virgin blame, As though she wish'd my heart despair; How could the maid suspect a flame, Who never knew that she was fair? TO JULIA. From her whom ev'ry heart must love, And ev'ry eye with wonder see; My sad, my lifeless steps remove— Ah! were she fair alone for me! In vain to solitudes I fly, To bid her form from mem'ry part; That form still dwells on Mem'ry's eye, And roots its beauties in my heart. In ev'ry rose that decks the vales, I see her cheek's pure blush appear: And when the lark the morning hails, 'Tis Julia's voice salutes my ear. Thus let me rove the world around, Whatever Beauty's charm can boast, Or sooth the soul with sweetest sound, Must paint the idol I have lost. SONG. BY JULIA. When love hath charm'd the virgin's ear, She hides the tender thought in vain; How oft a blush, a sigh, a tear, Betrays the sweetly-anxious pain! Dear youth! a mutual flame I own: The sorrows of thy breast are mine; Thy virtues all my heart have won, That boasts a passion pure as thine. No more shalt thou my coldness mourn— I trust the drop that dims thine eye; I see fair Truth thy lips adorn, And hear her voice in ev'ry sigh. TO JULIA. Written near her Grave. Much-injur'd maid, who liest pale below, To thee a pilgrim sad I steal away; In mournful silence steal, o'erpower'd with woe, To bathe with floods of penitence thy clay. Oh! can thy gentle ghost the wretch forgive, Who seeks thy sod at this lone hour of night— A wretch, whose greatest hardship is to live, Who, dead to pleasure, sickens at the light? Oh! if my grief could sooth the sweetest shade, And pardon gain, which Justice must deny; Near Julia's ashes should this form be laid; Its crimes forgotten—then what bliss to die! Tir'd of the world, my heart no longer prays (What others covet) for extended years: For who would madly court a length of days, To count (alas!) the moments by his tears! ELEGY. TO JULIA. Detained in Italy by contrary Winds, he expresses his Desire for sailing for England. Far from my Julia's arms I lonely sigh, And wish to clasp thy beauties, but in vain; The surly winds my only wish deny, Yet would I dare the dangers of the main. Ye winds and waves, how cruel to combine! O let my pray'rs your rude rude pity prove; Think of the gloomy moments that are mine! Alas! ye know not what it is to love! To stately structures now I urge my way, And weakly think the minutes to beguile; But anxious Love will not be led astray: Love goads my bosom for the virgin's smile. Now where the painter shows his mimic art, I strive to free my soul from Love's alarms; Lo, ev'ry Venus but augments my smart, And to my view presents thy brighter charms. To Music now fatigu'd I yield my ear, But Music cannot the dull hours control; With cold indifference ev'ry chord I hear, While not a sound descends into my soul. Oft as I mark the tribes of air, I cry, ‘How with your pinions would I mount the wind! Oh! with what rapture lifted, cleave the sky, And, turn'd to Britain, leave my cares behind!’ In wishes thus, I daily waste my breath, Chain'd by the tempest to this hated shore; When shall I leave, alas! this land of death, For life and thee, to part, my love, no more? ELEGY. To a Friend, describing the Horrors of his Situation after the death of Julia. Friend of my bosom, all my joys are o'er— Peace, gentle Peace, alas! no longer mine: Since Julia, once my idol, lives no more, To gloom and solitude I steal to pine. There, as I sit upon the sod, and sigh, I hear reproof from every happy dove; In Fancy's ear they cooing seem to cry, ‘We know not of inconstancy in love.’ Lo, darkness, tenfold darkness, suits my soul! The haunts of spectres let me court to weep; The beach where black with fate the billows roll, And tempests raise the thunders of the deep. Thou tellest me that Time a balm will bring, Sooth ev'ry sigh, and calm my keenest woes: Go, seek in Winter's wild the blooms of Spring; Go, whisper to the restless surge, repose! Love, injur'd Love, a sure revenge can boast; Love hears my groan, and mocks my soul's despair: ‘Bleed, victim, bleed,’ he cries—‘thy all is lost; Such be their portion who deceive the fair!’ I thought that Grandeur with a liberal hand Could strew my path of life with sweetest flow'rs; That Wealth omnipotent could Time command, And from his pinions pluck his whitest hours. Constant in Mem'ry's eye her form appears— Where'er I tread, a source of woe I find; In ev'ry rill methinks I see her tears, And hear her sigh in ev'ry passing wind. What now remains, my horrors to beguile? Away, ye dreams of grandeur, wealth, away! Who cannot give my cheek one little smile, Nor bribe a single moment to be gay. ORSON AND ELLEN; A LEGENDARY TALE. Sequiturque patrem, non passibus æquis. VIRGIL. I try t'excel in legendary tale, The lady, gentleman, and miss, of rhime; In vain, alas! my creeping efforts fail! Far, far unequal to their march sublime. CANTO I. ‘Turn, farmer, turn thy horse's head, And taste my ale so bright,’ Cried Boniface, whose sign display'd The lion in his might. Yet how unlike the royal beast, Who for his phiz ne'er sat? Wherefore deriding tongues did call The sign, the Old Red Cat! Yea, much unlike indeed was it! Jove's eagle and a gander, Matthias and the tuneful Pope, Lord Rolle and Alexander. ‘Who boasts such ale?’ quoth Boniface; ‘No landlord that draws breath. A gallon I could fairly drink, Ev'n in the pangs of death!’ Young Orson from his horse leap'd off, And shook the landlord's hand, Then sought a room to taste this ale, The best in all the land. The landlord had a red round face, Which some folks said, in fun, Resembled his Red Lion's phiz; And some, the rising sun. Large slices from his cheeks and chin, Like beef-steakes, one might cut; And then his paunch, for goodly size, Beat any brewer's butt. This landlord was a boozer stout, A snuff-taker and smoker; And 'twixt his eyes a nose did shine Bright as a red-hot poker. Were gunpowder put on his snout, Nor flint it would require, And steel, to make the sable grains Flash off in sudden fire. Thus when we see a nose so red, It is as day-light clear, That ruby nose is not maintain'd On water or small beer. Young Orson was a comely youth, Stout as an oaken tree; A farm he had in Taunton Vale And money, too, had he! Whene'er he spied a buxom lass, His chops began to water; And as the kites on pigeons pounce, The rogue was sure to pat her. But he his neck to wedlock's yoke Would not consent to bow; Quoth he, ‘The man who milk can buy, Should never keep a cow!’ Of lovely maids at least a score Did rue his wanton tricks! A mournful band! a sable list! Like moles between cleft sticks! Now at the table Boniface And Orson sat them both, While 'twixt the twain a pewter-pot, Did mantling foam with froth. Now Orson rais'd the pewter-pot, And blew the froth away: And having drank, he smack'd his lips, And cheerily did say; ‘Old Boniface, thou'rt in the right! Thy taste is sound enough; I wish my cellar now could boast A tun of such rare stuff! Sweet Ellen gave the pot with hands That might with thousands vie; Her face, like veal, was white and red, And sparkling was her eye. Her shape the poplar's easy form, Her neck the lily's white, Soft heaving, like the summer wave, And lifting rich delight. And o'er this neck of globe-like mould, In ringlets wav'd her hair: Ah, what sweet contrast for the eye, The jetty and the fair! Her lips like cherries moist with dew, So pretty, plump, and pleasing! And like the juicy cherry, too, Did seem to ask for squeezing. Yet Ellen modest was withal, And kept her charms in order; For beauty is a dangerous gift, And apt to breed disorder. Yet what is beauty's use, alack! To market can it go? Say, will it buy a loin of veal, Or rump of beef? No, no. Will butchers say, ‘Choose what you please, Miss Nancy and Miss Betty?’ Or gard'ners, ‘Take my beans and peas, Because ye are so pretty?’ Too oft, alas! a daughter's charms Increase a parent's cares; For daughters and dead fish, we find, Were never keeping wares. Yet spotless was this virgin's heart— Quite spotless, too, her fame! And if a swain but kiss'd her neck, It show'd the blush of shame! For once a saucy Oxford youth Dar'd kiss it to a glow— How like the modest blush of morn Upon a hill of snow! Yet blushes are exceeding scarce; The great folk scorn to name 'em, Since Fashion, ruling with strong sway, Has bid all courts disclaim 'em. Yes, yes! a blush is vastly scarce! O fie, O fie upon't! And when it glows, lo! Fashion calls The virtue, mauvaise honte! Oh! can the great for modesty Not care a single rush! Ah! never be a British maid A stranger to a blush! Ah! who can pierce the simple heart, Give modesty a fear— Raise with rude hands the burning blush, And force the pearly tear? Yet there are demons who delight Her panting heart to wound, Darken with Sorrow's cloud her eye, And force the groan profound. Ah! wanton Fashion, thou loose dame, Who biddest ev'ry man see The charms which darkness should conceal, And man should only fancy. The ankle, nay, the knee and thigh, Are secrets now no more! God bless us! every day of each A man may see a score! The bishop was not in the wrong, But really in the right, Who at the opera saw such things As shock'd his holy sight. Yet some have said, yea, loudly said, With many a scornful jeer— ‘A poor old wither'd blinking fool, What business had he there?’ ‘If bishops and their wives will leave Their church for wanton places; 'Tis rank hypocrisy to make A set of prudish faces.’ Now Orson's eyes forsook the pot, And mark'd the maid with fire; For Ellen's fair and artless look Did kindle high desire. For beauty doth possess the charm To pull abroad men's eyes, And wake the wishes of the soul, And bid the passions rise. For why? Because 'tis Nature's plan The world should be supported; Therefore, wherever Beauty smiles, It will be press'd and courted. Thus amber doth attract the straws, The loadstone draws the needle; And drawn too are the female heels By tabor, pipe, and fiddle. Now Orson whisper'd to himself, ‘Gad's bob! if things go right, With that nice girl who gave the pot I'll sleep this very night!’ O monstrous thought! O wicked wish! O soul-destroying sin! Yet for his soul (O graceless youth!) He did not care one pin. Thus on the dolphin's beauteous scale, The shark he opes his jaw! Poor fish! who, ere he danger feels, Is in the tyrant's maw. Thus spiders when they see a fly How bailiff-like they watch it! And ere, poor imp, he thinks of harm, The grimly rascals catch it. CANTO II. Fair Ellen liv'd with Boniface Nor scorn'd her humble sphere; And with unsullied fame she drew Her customers their beer. How neat was Ellen in her dress! As neat as a new pin! By this she brought full many a pound To Boniface's inn. Thus Goldfinches, in fields well plac'd The distant birds engage, And by their dainty forms and voice,, Invite them to their cage. And thus the pastry-cooks should do, To sell their tarts and pies; Put in their shop some pretty lass, To hook in passing eyes. For many a man, whose appetite Desires nor pie nor tart, May like to squeeze a charming girl, And ogle for her heart. Nay, milliners should do the same, For custom if they hope; And many a trade beside should keep A nice tit in the shop. And let me own, in times of yore, When Love was seldom quiet, But quicken'd night and day my blood, And bred a constant riot; I bought my garters and my gloves, Wherever Beauty shone; When Ugliness was in a shop, I let that shop alone. For beauty may be well compar'd, I think, unto a hook; Which, baited with a lady-bird, Draws fishes from the brook. Ellen was chaste as new-fall'n snow, And modest in her air; Unlike some lasses, common known As is a barber's chair. Of goodly parents was she born, But in disguise did row, Because a youth to her was false— She left her vale for love. Six years she pass'd in servitude, At last forgot the sigh; Her lover's image forc'd no more The pearl-drops from her eye. Yet many a month she ceas'd to smile, And droop'd the languid head; And many a lonely walk she took, The secret tear to shed. ‘Ah! happy birds,’ she oft would sigh Amid the tuneful grove— ‘You bear no guile within your hearts, You break no vows of love. ‘Alas! 'tis man alone deceives: He wins the witless heart; Then meanly treads it in the dust, And triumphs in his art.’ Thus in her solitary walk Would Ellen say and sigh; And then sweet ditties she would sing, Of maids for love that die. For Sorrow listens with fond ear To Music's plaintive flow; Devours the sweetly-dying strain, And feeds on tales of woe. The parish 'squire, though wedded he Unto a lady fair, Hath often at the Lion stopp'd, On Ellen's charms to stare. For married eyes, if not well watch'd, Are very apt to stray; For which some ladies give their lords A lesson night and day. And very properly I wot; For eyes of married men Should only on one object look, Whereas they stare on ten. A married man should winkers wear, Like coach-horses and cart; To rule the eyes, those squinting pimps That oft seduce the heart. For so deprav'd our sex, I've known A man deep read in books, Who had a jewel of a wife, Yet kiss'd his greasy cooks. And what did make it ten times worse, T'increase his lady's woes; He kept the bastards of those cooks All underneath her nose; Who, if she dar'd to speak or weep, He instantly would kick her; And oft (to use a Devonshire phrase) The gentleman would lick her. Ah! Matrimony, thou art like To Jeremiah's figs; The good were very good, the bad Too sour to give the pigs. Now to fair Ellen to return— The parson of the parish, Although his mouth was most devout, His eyes were oft vagarish. For oft on Boniface he call'd, The news to ask or tell; Hoping his ale was fresh and good, And that his hogs were well. And was fair Ellen in the way, He catechis'd the maid; Hoping she always went to church, And like a Christian pray'd. And gently would he squeeze her hand, When nobody was near; And kindly pat her rosy cheek, With many a holy leer. And when the parson took a draught, He did persuade the lass To wet her lovely lips, and leave A kiss within the glass. For ev'n the gravest of divines To Beauty's empire yield; And spite of all their zeal and grace, Old Nick hath won the field. Lo! Bishop Keppel felt the charm, And waver'd from his duty: Confirming once a nice young maid, He gave up God for Beauty; So press'd her head with amorous hand, When lo, two large black pins, That slily lurk'd within her hair, Attack'd him for his sins. Deep in his flesh they urg'd their way; When, starting, the divine Exclaim'd, ‘G?d d?mn the head! I think The girl's a porcupine.’ Old Snuffle too, the parish clerk, Did sometimes call for ale; And knew not (when the maid was near) If mild it was, or stale. Of spectacles that rode his nose, He wink'd through each horn'd glass; And, goat-like, lick'd his watering lips, That long'd to buss the lass. Than o'er his Bible in the pew, Of pounds I would lay ten, Old Snuffle would much rather say, O'er Ellen's lips, amen. The dullest eye can beauty see, 'Tis lightning on the sight; Indeed it is a general bait, And man, the fish, will bite. Now Boniface talk'd of Lord Rolle, A lord in fight so frisky; Who made an old dame Actually in Ireland, where his lordship performed prodigies of valour. prisoner, And took away her whisky. And eke on trav'lling corpses seiz'd, As fierce as any shark; And bullied, like a thunder-storm, The parson and the clerk. And now they talk'd of Sunday schools, Once deem'd a glorious thing; Prais'd and supported by the great, Admir'd by queen and king. But now 'gainst Sunday schools, alack, The great folk turn their faces; For fear the poor, by learning, should Grow wiser than their graces. For no great man indeed can bear That man of low degree Should read and write, since that poor man May be as wise as he. There is a lofty dame call'd Pride, With corns upon her toes: On which the mob is apt to tread, And very oft, God knows. Now this high dame companion is Of lords, and dukes, and kings; And duchesses, and eke of queens, Indeed, and such like things. And lo! she whispers to the great To keep themselves aloof; Nay, crush the poor like some sad worm Beneath a horse's hoof. And lo! the great her counsel take, And ears of poor folks crop; Nay, flog the poor at times, poor souls! As schoolboys flog a top. Now of a princess sweet they talk'd, And pitied her hard fate; ‘O Lord! O Lord!’ said Boniface, ‘Heav'n keep me from high state!’ ‘Poor lady!’ Orson pitying said, ‘I've seen her many a time; And seen the baby too with tears, And ask'd about her crime. ‘However people may invent, Whatever folks shall say, I won't believe—but think her still A jewel flung away. “Such sweetness never could offend— Then what's her guilt?” I cry'd; ‘But folks seem'd all afraid to speak, And shook the head, and sigh'd.’ Then Ellen said, ‘I would not be A princess, for the world.’— ‘Thou'rt more,’ quoth Orson, ‘or may I To Old Nick's house be hurl'd!’ ‘Thou art a queen,’ exclaims the youth; And for a kiss he starts— ‘Who! I?’ rejoin'd th' astonish'd maid— ‘Yes, thou—the queen of hearts.’ The maid receiv'd the youth's salute With such a modest air, As though from Mistress Stevenson's A lady who keeps a boarding-school., The empress of Queen-square. Now gentle reader, with thy leave, I'll rest my tuneful tongue; And shun of nightingales the fate, Who die by too much song. CANTO III. And now they talk'd of good great men, Who by their merits rise; When Bishop Porteus was the theme;— Great, though of little size: Who, though before the Chancellor He humbly bore the mace, Did at the last a mitre wear; Such Friends are Faith and Grace. Now Boniface did loud exclaim, For wondrous proud was he: ‘D'ye know that this same bishop's wife No better was than me? ‘No better, though the lofty wife Of this most grand divine! Her father did an alehouse keep, No better, man, than mine! ‘There Madam Porteus, a young maid, Did draw the ale and beer; And drew good customers, 'tis said, Indeed from far and near. ‘When Parson Porteus trudg'd that way— Now see how things may hap! And, sweating, took a pint of stout From this young maiden's tap. ‘Now Love within the pewter pot, So wondrous is his art, Lurk'd sly, and as the parson swill'd, Slipp'd down into his heart. ‘At once he glow'd with furious flame, And ey'd the comely she; And very soon he squeez'd her hand, For wounded much was he. ‘Thus, when the linnet flies to drink To some fair crystal spring, By lime-twigs quickly is he caught And cannot move a wing. ‘Now soon as the young girl's papa The courtship did explore, He took them by the shoulders both, And shov'd them both to door. ‘As Adam and his dearest Eve Left Eden with a tear; So Porteus with his sweetheart left The tap-room and the beer. ‘Forth wander'd they in homely plight, Griev'd that their plan miscarried; But soon, in spite of poverty, The loving pair were married. ‘Nor proud is Mistress Porteus now, Though lofty is her lot; For glad is she old friends to see, And eke a pewter pot.’ Thus ended Boniface; and now They talk'd of Hannah More, Whose fame the bishop's trumpet sounds, That makes a mighty roar. Then on each other they did wink, Which thus might be translated; Some people may a mitre wear, And yet be shallow-pated. And now they prais'd the bishop's care, Who makes it all his pride To see the clergy well behave, And on their cures reside. For, lo! the bishop finds it hard Unto their cures to pull 'em; Though he, good man, for reasons wise, Doth seldom preach at Fulham. ‘I fear some bishops are in fault,’ Quoth Boniface, and sigh'd— ‘They are a proud and haughty set.’— ‘Too true,’ the youth replied. ‘Over poor curates’ backs, alas! How Jehu-like they drive! And, Lord! how these old drones will suck The honey of the hive!’ Of Dame Religion now they talk'd, Belov'd by each divine; Who thinks their wealthy patroness All in a deep decline. To bring her back to health again, Of recipes a score Good Doctor Porteus jointly wrote With Parson Hannah More. For, lo! the dame with these great folk Has always been in favour; For which they both for her would fight, And risk their all to save her. Most grossly was she us'd in France; Most cruelly, alack! Her pockets pick'd, and her best clothes All pilfer'd from her back. The French swore she a bastard was Of some old canting friar; And from her childhood known to be A hypocrite and liar. Her rings they robb'd, and di'monds too; Her gold they stole by tuns; With which they shot and powder bought, Swords, muskets, and great guns. Not only this, indeed, was done By this same rabble rout; They broke the bones of saints, and kick'd The saintesses about. Such was their treatment by the mob, Such rage did Hell inspire; If gold, they coin'd them; and, if wood, They put them in the fire. Old jawbones of the sainted tribes Old teeth, old nails, old noses, Old toes, old shoes, that wonders work'd, As ev'ry one supposes. Old wigs, and night-caps, gowns, and rags, Spoon, trencher, knife and fork; Pap-spoon, and frying-pan, and spit, That many a marvel work. ‘Religion was a gentle maid,’ Quoth Boniface agen— ‘In the year one; but since she's spoil'd By wicked artful men. ‘The bishops taught her to be proud, And heap of wealth a store; To paint her cheeks, and wear the garb Of some sad tawdry w?. ‘I think she is too well dress'd out By ev'ry great divine.’— ‘Indeed,’ quoth Orson with a sigh, ‘I think she goes too fine.’ Of Peter Pindar now they talk'd, Who so divinely sings; Renown'd from pole to pole for odes, And compliments to kings. Then, raptur'd, on his works they dwelt, And on his high pretension; Lamenting much he had not got From majesty a pension: While parasites, and pimps to lords, Enjoy'd their wealth and state; While he, poor soul, did make wry mouths Upon an empty plate. On which they sagely did remark, That slight was merit's meed; And that the sun, for one fair flow'r, Did foster many a weed. ‘I have his works,’ quoth Boniface, ‘This moment in the house; Pray, Farmer, did you ever read His poem on a Louse? ‘And Apple Dumplings and chok'd Sheep, The Pilgrims and the Peas; The Brick-kiln, Brewhouse, Parson Young, And Songs that ladies please?’ ‘This great man's poems I have read; Yes, over, sir, and over,’ Quoth Orson, with a wink and smile That pleasure did discover. ‘But then,’ said he, and gave a shrug, ‘Some alderman and may'r Swore that his impudence is such, It bristled up their hair: ‘Said that he grins too much at courts, And never would refrain; And in respect of titled folk, Was wicked as Tom Paine. ‘They call'd him ev'ry name that's bad, Turk, Infidel, and Jew; And wanted, when they burnt his books, To burn the a thor too.’ ‘O shameful aldermen and may'r, To burn so sweet a bard!’ Cry'd Boniface—‘alas! alas! 'Twas very, very hard. ‘The Justice too, I do suppose, Did hate him from his marrow; And with as much good-will would shoot The poet as a sparrow. ‘I hope this wondrous man of verse Is steel'd with resolution; As virtuous people, in all times, Have suffer'd persecution.’ And now they talk'd of one George Rose, Who born in low estate, Did mount to worship and to wealth— So very blind is fate. Of George's mother then they talk'd, Her hut, and dirty geer; And said, that George allow'd his dam But thirty pounds a year. Poor crone, who swore she would have more, Or, lo! his pride to sting, She'd run to London in her rags, And show them to the king. But George disliketh much to hear About his Scottish home; Thus scabby heads, the proverb says, For ever hate a comb. And now of Hawkesbury they talk'd, Who wrote in mags for hire; Whose works, till in the chimney put, Ne'er felt one spark of fire. Of taxes now they talk'd, and curs'd The emperor o'er and o'er; And then on Paul they pour'd some gall And very loudly swore. ‘The game laws too,’ quoth Boniface, Provoke me to the quick; We must not knock a pheasant down, Although 'tis with a stick. ‘Curse on the justices, the thieves, That send a man to jail, For touching, with an inch of gun, A partridge or a quail: ‘Who threat my licence too to take, And ding, and huff, and vapour, Because I won't be humm'd, and buy George Rose's stupid paper Which of the two papers is meant by Boniface, we cannot ascertain; as the Sun was accustomed to lick up the leavings of the poor dead or dying True Briton, and disgorge for the benefit of the public: either of those newspapers, therefore, may be alluded to by the landlord, as their respective merits are rather beneath the dignity of criticism. We must say, indeed, that every exertion has been made, particularly by the Post-Office, to cram their trash down the throats of the nauseating people of England. A newspaper is made the test of our political principles. Is the Morning Post, or the Courier, or the Morning Chronicle called for, the man is branded with the odious name of jacobin. Yet who reads of a defeat in these ministerial hirelings? Pæans are for ever sung: British laurels neither decrease nor fade—all alive and blooming! Victory attends the chariot of every British Mars—and the fools-cap which the comquering and contemptuous enemy now and then clapped on the heads of some of our generals, has been, by the hocus pocus of a misrepresenting newspaper, converted into a triumphal crown.!’ Now talk'd they of the princesses Elizabeth and Mary, Whose taste in all the polish'd arts Is most extraordinary. Then of the sweetness of their looks, Their manners all so mild; That win, where'er they pass, the heart Of man, and maid, and child. And let me also join my praise, Before I further sing; The Muse with rapture oft hath mark'd The daughters of the king. And if her voice could pour a strain, To yield their hearts delight; Lo! all Parnassus with their names Should ring from morn to night. CANTO IV. Now Negress Night came solemn down To put to roost the fowls; To bid her bats a hunting go, And likewise all her owls. And eke she op'd the dreary tombs, T'enjoy her spectre races; Unlocking ghosts, to frighten folk With shrouds and mealy faces. And now amid the hags and owls, And gliding spectres pale, Mute silence, with her feet in felt, Did stalk from vale to vale. The birds their thatch and bushes sought, Forsaking trees and springs, To hide their slumbering heads beneath Those downy quilts their wings. Now Darkness with her pinions black, All waving wide outspread, Mov'd solemn, and with horror join'd, Did wrap the world in shade. Now Theft and Murder sly stole forth From caves of dread and death, In quest of damned deeds, to roam The wild and spectred heath; To meet some wanderer of the shade, And make his life their food: To seize his throat with ruffian grasp, And plunge their knives in blood. And now amid the London streets, Poor outcasts from their home, The female bands, ah! lost to fame, (Sweet beauty's wrecks!) did roam. For these, let pity heave the sigh, And prudery stay her rage: And rather curse seducing pimps, The G?ff?ds of the age; Who prowl where innocence appears, And watch for beauty's smile; To tear the rose-bud from its bed, Then stamp it in the soil. Now artfully, with rueful face, Did Orson, cunning spark, Step to the door, and cry, ‘It rains— And, Lord! how dismal dark! And then the wind it is so high, That I can scarcely stand; And then the sky's like murder black, I cannot see my hand.’ ‘Sleep here, my friend,’ the landlord said: ‘A bed, but not of flocks, Is thine—of feathers nice and soft, Pick'd all from hens and cocks. ‘Fine too the sheets—like lilies white, And warm too is the rug; And trust me that it has not got A single flea or bug. ‘A little supper we will have; And, if I'm not mistaken, Thou likest meat—now what dost say, My friend, to eggs and bacon?’ To which the smiling youth reply'd, ‘I'm vastly fond of hog; And when 'tis fry'd with eggs, I vow I know no prettier prog.’ Now Ellen, with a knife so keen, To slice the flesh began; And then she broke twelve new-laid eggs, And put them in the pan. But growing warm against the hog, The eggs unpleasant mutter'd; While, waxing hotter 'gainst the eggs, The hog with fury sputter'd. Alas! how much like man and wife! What pity such things be! Who at each other fiercely spit, And often disagree. The eggs and bacon soon were fry'd, And plac'd upon the table; When Orson and the landlord ate As much as they were able. And now the merry mug went round, And many a tale they told; And many a wanton joke they crack'd, Some new, and others old. While Ellen, busy at her work, Seem'd not one word to hear; But not a serious word or joke Escap'd the maiden's ear. For where is she, the maid, I wot, 'Mongst high or humble folk, That liketh not a merry tale, Nor yet a wanton joke? Now Boniface to Orson said, ‘As we no longer munch, Suppose, my friend, with this our ale, We take a glass of punch?’ To which the youth did answer make, ‘Dear friend, with all my heart: And Ellen shall the lemons squeeze, And likewise take a part. ‘And Ellen too with us shall sit, And take her cheerful glass; For what is meat, and drink, and life, Without a charming lass?’ Now Ellen did the lemons squeeze, The sugar put, and rum in; And made what ev'n a king would call A bowl of liquor humming. ‘Landlord,’ quoth Orson, ‘with your leave, And Ellen's too I mean, I'll take a kiss from her nice lips, That would adorn a queen.’ ‘Aye,’ cry'd the landlord, ‘kiss her, man, She's sweeter than the rose; A kiss can do no mighty harm; So, girl, hold up thy nose.’ Then from those cherries of delight He kisses took a score; And, but for decency, the rogue Had ravish'd twenty more. For kisses are the food of love, Well known in ev'ry nation; And such a dainty dish, indeed, Will ne'er be out of fashion. And ladies' lips the out-works I To ladies' hearts may call; Soon as the first are storm'd, the last Most nat'rally will fall. ‘Now sing a song,’ said Boniface, ‘Thy best, and do not grudge it.’ ‘Yes, that I will,’ the youth reply'd, ‘I've many in my budget.’ Then Orson op'd his throat, and sang, Both loud, and sweet, and clear, A song that much the landlord charm'd, And caught fair Ellen's ear. SONG, BY ORSON. I OWN I am fickle: to Phillida's ear I first told the story of love; Kiss'd her hand, press'd her lip with what ardour sincere! And declar'd that I never would rove. But my sighs were scarce breath'd when Chloe tripp'd by: The nymph was no longer my boast; From Phillida's beauty away went the sigh, And my heart to sweet Chloe was lost. Could I dream of a change, when Chloe was mine? ‘No, no,’ I a thousand times swore; ‘My heart cannot rove from a girl so divine; No, no, it will wander no more.’ But Fate, who delighted to laugh at the swain, Presented a damsel more fair; My heart! the sad rogue, turn'd inconstant again, And sigh'd to Corinna his pray'r. With Corinna I swore, ‘Ev'ry hour must be blest; These eyes shall no other pursue;’ When agen, to alarm with new tumults my breast, Thou, Sylvia, beam'st full on my view. But, Sylvia, I'm sure thou hast nothing to fear, That my heart for another can pine; Since, to make it a traitor, a girl must appear, Whose beauty is equal to thine. ‘Now sing thy song,’ the lark-like youth To Boniface did say; When Boniface most loudly sung This merry roundelay. SONG, BY BONIFACE. TOPER, drink, and help the house— Drink to ev'ry honest fellow; Life was never worth a louse To the man who ne'er was mellow. How it sparkles! here it goes! Ale can make a blockhead shine; Toper, torchlike may thy nose Light thy face up, just like mine! See old Sol, I like his notion, With his whiskers all so red; Sipping, drinking from the ocean, Boozing till he goes to bed; Yet poor beverage to regale! Simple stuff to help his race— Could he turn the sea to ale, How 'twould make him mend his pace! Now Boniface to Ellen said, ‘Now for thy roundelay;’ The damsel blush'd, and hemm'd, and blush'd, And then she sung away. SONG, BY ELLEN. ADIEU to the grotto and glade! Adieu to the song of the grove! Since Colin is gone from the shade, Adieu to the valley of Love! When a garland he wove for my hair, When he gave me his hand at the stile, How buxom and sweet was the air! How the fields were all cloth'd with a smile! But Nature seems chang'd to my mind— The fields are all dark on my eye; Each song is a dirge on the wind, And the flow'rs seem all drooping to die. All alone must I wander at morn, And lonely, at eve, a poor ghost; While each object around me forlorn, Will pity the peace I have lost. Then ask me not, virgins, to stay; With a sigh seems the zephyr to blow; And the runlet that murmurs away, To wind with a murmur of woe. O ye virgins! O shepherds! farewell! I wander in secret to pine! May Content be the guest of your cell, Who has long been a stranger to mine! The youth upon her tuneful lips Did full of rapture glote; And seem'd so pleas'd, as though he could Have gallop'd down her throat. He look'd and sigh'd, and sigh'd and look'd With longing wishful eye; And felt his heart all flutt'ring beat, And guess'd the reason why. For who can see the lovely maid, And feel not sweet desire? With him may Life's fair prospects fade, And Hope itself expire! The clock, the crier shrill of time, That tick'd behind the door, Now with his hammer struck the bell Twelve times, and lo! no more. And now the fire was all put out, Which Boniface did water; For fear a spark might burn the house, And make a serious matter! For fire, permitted once to rule, Consumeth all it handles; Ev'n from the palaces of kings, Down to a pound of candles. The cat amidst the ashes purr'd (For purs to cats belong); While chimney-minstrels, crickets call'd, Did join Grimalkin's song. O gentle crickets, to your airs I've listen'd o'er and o'er! O lucky imps, where'er ye dwell, That house is never poor. Old Towzer too lay stretch'd along, And yelping much did keep; And with his trembling joints did chase The rabbits in his sleep: Eager he seem'd to hunt indeed The nibblers to their holes: Thus dogs can dream like gentlemen, Although they have no souls. Now Boniface said, ‘Sir, good night,’ And shook young Orson's fist. ‘Good night,’ agen young Orson said, And then he Ellen kiss'd; And on her pouting lip he left A thousand wanton wishes: ‘Good night,’ quoth he, ‘fair maid, whose eyes Eclipse thy pewter dishes.’ Yes, 'twas a kiss!—a kiss indeed!— A very wanton kiss! Which seem'd upon her mouth to say, I long for higher bliss. CANTO V. Now as he kiss'd her, on her neck A golden cross he spied:— ‘Who gave thee this?’ the starting youth, All fraught with wonder cried. ‘A young man gave me this,’ quoth she (And then she dropp'd a tear), ‘A youth who won my heart away, And still to me is dear. ‘But riches forc'd him from these arms; And men do wealth adore; And thus he left my heart to pine, For I was rather poor. ‘A damsel of a great estate Did steal his heart away; At which I left my native vale, For there I could not stay. ‘For who can stand the scoffs and jeers That bitter flow like gall: So when I lost my sweetheart's love, Alas! I lost my all. ‘Where now he lives, God only knows; Five years it is and more, That here in Hampshire I have dwelt, And here my loss deplore. ‘Methought, sir, when the mug of beer This very night I drew, That Orson, whom I thought my own, Did much resemble you. ‘My heart so beat, my head turn'd round; My eyes both misty taken— I almost dropp'd the frying-pan, With all the eggs and bacon.’ ‘My Ellen sweet,’ the youth replied, And hugg'd her to his heart; ‘Behold that Orson thou hast lost, And we will never part. ‘I am not married—no, my dear; To marry I am free; And I have search'd half England through, To gaze again on thee. ‘But thou wert gone the Lord knows where, And wert not to be found; But all the neighbours said with sighs Thou certainly wert drown'd.’ ‘O Orson dear,’ the maid replied, ‘And am I in thy arms?’ ‘Thou art, thou art,’ the youth rejoin'd— And closely press'd her charms. ‘How was't I knew thee not?’ quoth she— Quoth he, ‘I wasn't so big; And now thou seest I wear my hair, And then I wore a wig.’ ‘Ah me! I recollect,’ quoth she, ‘Full well thy natty bob; And then I only wore my hair, And now I wear a mob.’ ‘Sweet Ellen,’ cry'd the raptur'd youth, ‘The reason now is plain— The mob and ribbon are the cause I knew thee not again. ‘I think that thou art taller grown Thy shape's so nice and clever; And without compliment thou art A prettier girl than ever. ‘Landlord, behold the girl for whom I've hunted round and round.’ ‘Gadsbob,’ cried Boniface, ‘what luck! The lost sheep then is found.’ To tell the joys of both their hearts, Would puzzle my poor pen; But lo, they kiss'd, and sigh'd, and kiss'd, And kiss'd and sigh'd agen. And now they did a sixpence break, In plight of mutual troth; While Boniface, with happy looks, Did smile upon them both. ‘well, now, good folks,’ quoth Boniface, ‘I'll leave you, if ye choose, To tell your tale, while I go take A comfortable snooze.’ Thus having said, Old Boniface March'd, hobbling, off to bed; And put a good red night-cap on, Of yarn, about his head. Night-caps of different stuff are made: Of different colours, too— Of flannel, and of cotton some; Some yellow, and some blue. Sleep is an article we want, Although it looks like death; Since all from mortals seem retir'd, Except it be the breath. How often have I said and thought, Lost in reflection deep, ‘What pity 'tis, since life's so short, To spend one half in sleep! ‘But then,’ quoth I unto myself, ‘Sleep calms the folks that fret; Is kind to souls with hungry maws, And people much in debt. ‘Nay, sleep has this advantage too, It goodly feasts doth make; And furnisheth rare food in dreams We cannot find awake.’ Now Orson with his Ellen sat, The damsel on his knee; No loving couple in the world Were blest like he and she. And now they smil'd and told old tales That happen'd when they courted; Together when to fairs they went, And danc'd, and play'd, and sported. Time stole most happily away! While Boniface, above, Lay senseless snoring, they below, Alive were making love. Now morning from her clouded east Did through the window peep Upon the playful loving pair, Whose eyes look'd not for sleep. For they were otherwise employed In oggling soft desire; In telling stories of the heart, And fanning Love's sweet fire. Their eyelids did not once pick straws, And wink and sink away; No, no, they were as brisk as bees, And amorous things did say. For eyes are eloquent, though mute: They speak all sorts of tongues; Such very cunning things are eyes— Such pow'r to them belongs. Now Ellen unto Orson said, ‘Retire, my friend, to rest; Thou with thy journey must be tir'd, And I will seek my nest.’ ‘Ah, Ellen, I feel no fatigue,’ Said Orson, with a smile; ‘I am this moment fesh as though I had not rid a mile. ‘'Tis thou hast giv'n me spirits gay, And made my heart so light; Well, Ellen, now I think 'tis time Indeed to bid good night.’ And now he took her in his arms, And said, ‘Good night, my dear;’ When Ellen said ‘Good night’ agen, And dropp'd the tenderest tear. It was a tear—a precious tear, More worth than di'monds bright; For love and friendship form'd the drop, That charm'd young Orson's sight. As down her cheek this pearl did flow, Young Orson, mad with bliss, Quick to her cheek his lips applied, And caught it with a kiss. Then gallantly the young man said, And swore of oaths a round— ‘That pearl of thine, my lovely girl, Shall never kiss the ground. ‘O dearest Ellen, mind my words, And mind I tell thee true: Wherever that bright gem had dropp'd, The ground had been Peru. ‘But I will go, since 'tis thy wish: My angel fair, good night; Sweet dreams to thee, my only dear, Aye, dreams of rich delight.’ ‘Sweet dreams unto my friend also, With sweetest smiles,’ said she; ‘Ah, then of Ellen I must dream,’ With gallantry said he. And now they both retir'd to rest, Both bidding soft farewell; And which was happiest in their dreams, Is difficult to tell. Now Sol had mounted up the sky A pair of yards at least, When from their beds the couple sprung, And very soon were drest. To breakfast down they happy came, With Boniface likewise; Who stretch'd his limbs, and yawn'd, and gap'd, And open'd both his eyes. For Boniface's eyes had long The winks of Love forgot; Preferring to the fairest maid, A foaming pewter pot. To tea and toast down sat they all; And not long after tarried— Before they went before the priest, And happily were married. ‘And now,’ said Boniface with glee, ‘You shall not go away; A sumptuous dinner I will give In honour of the day.’ Now goose and turkey came, and hare, And apple-pie and custard; And chicken and asparagus, And Yorkshire ham and mustard. And friends invited to partake, Did from the village come; Of different ages were they all, Some young, and aged some. Within the house did mirth resound; Without, with cheerful ray, Sol pour'd his radiance on the roof, And all the world was gay! The chirping sparrows came in flocks, And linnets with a tune; And round in merry gambols flew, To hail the honey-moon. The wrens delighted cock'd their tails, And twitter'd many an air; While redbreasts trilling through the panes, Peep'd in upon the pair. And eke the pigeons, birds of love, Did sport upon the thatch; And coo'd and bill'd, and flapp'd their wings In honour of the match. No happier hours were known—so swift The moments took their flight; 'Twas laugh and song, and gibe and joke, And stories of delight. At night all slily from their friends The couple stole away; Which night, if I don't much mistake, Was happier than the day. God prosper long the married state, And give it every bliss! And may we kiss the nymphs we please, And please the nymphs we kiss! NEW-OLD BALLADS. [Ah! woe is mee, who sighe forlorne] Written by Queen Elizabeth, during her Imprisonment at Woodstock. Ah! woe is mee, who sighe forlorne, Sith woe has fixed depe his thorne In thys poor harte! The milkmaid's songe when morne doeth smyle, And Phœbus gildeth fielde and style, Doth greefe emparte. I envy birdes that cleave the skye; Ye live in freedom, imps! I sighe, Then droppe a tear: And eke I cast an envious looke Upon the little babbling brooke That runneth neare. Like the swete brooke I wish to flee From fielde to fielde in merry glee; But my poor harte doth pant in vayne To joine the milkmayde on the plaine, Who seemes so blest! Dispayre approaches, and thus cryes: ‘To Freedom cease to turne thine eyes Sith I'm thy guest.’ O drear companion! ah, most drear! Whose voice is horror to mine ear! TO THE GLASS. Give me the glasse that felt her lippe, And happy, happy shall I sippe: And when is fled the daintie wyne, Something remaineth still divyne. Heaven's dewes that on the flower doe falle, Make them to smyle and fayre withal; And thus the dewe of her sweet kisse Doth bathe my heart with balmy blisse: But dewes to vapoure flye awaye, While her rich fragrance lasts for aye. J. D. TO THE DAISIE. O modest flow'r! thou tellest of the springe! Welcome unto this little fielde of myne! With joy I see thee from the green earth springe, And smiling in thy silvery vesture shine! Ah! nought disturbeth thy fayre tender frame; Zephyrus kisseth thee, and tastes thy sweet: Thou dost not chide the wanton rogue—no blame, Nor biddest him sighe lowly at thy feet. Agayne he whispereth love; and now agayne He tasteth of thy honey'd leaves, and sighs! And though he wantons, thou dost not complayne; Thy little snowy bosom nought denyes. O gentle daisie! speak to her I love When she doeth come, and casteth lookes on thee; Persuade her my pure passion to approve, And not with coldness from her shepheard flee: But imitate thy ways, and learne thy smyle, When I, like Zephyrus, doe press her cheke; Then may no tempest rude thy form defyle, And of thy snowy beauties make a wreck! A PRAISE OF FAYRE GERALDINE, BY LORD SURREY. I sighe mournfulle for Geraldine, For lovelie Geraldine I playne; And oft I wish her harte was mine, But vaine are sighes, and teares are vaine. But she perchaunce mote cruel be, And slighten of Cupid the bande, Because she may not fynde a he That meriteth her lilied hande. Ah me! sith none but such may wooe, And turne to her with hope his eyes; Far hence fayre Geraldine must goe, And seek a lover in the skyes. BALLADE OF LOVE. Thou art the loadsterre of my love, Which love doth many tempests fynde; But thou canst all the stormes remove, And whisper calme unto my mynde. Thy balmy breathe can fille the sayle, And bless me with a prosperous gale. But, no—for this I may not hope; On rocks thou doomest me to mourne: My vessel without maste or rope, All on the black rock piece-meal torne: And there I wis without a sighe, Thou lettest my poore vessel lye, But if thy smile would fix on me, A safe porte then my shippe may fynde; Then Phœbus' beams break out, I see, And leave the tossing waves behinde. With jocund heart then I do prove, Thou art the loadsterre of my love. BALLADE OF GRIEF. I know not joy, when far from thee, For thou art all the world to me: Then come away. Though thou art farre, yet Love's swift darte, For ever flying, wounds my harte, From day to day. I seeke to sleepe away the hours, But thy image my calme devours, And keepes me waking: And when, alack! I close myne eye, I starte, and with keen anguish sighe, ‘Thou'rt me forsaking!’ Then come, fayre mayde, and with thee bringe In thy twin cheeks the blossom'd springe, And sommer's gold In thy twin eyes, that I may find The sommer's beam within my mind, Not winter's cold. THE PETITION OF THE LOVER. Ah! say not ‘No’ unto my pray'r, For I have loved thee full long; To these twin eyes thou art most fayre, Surpassing praise of sweetest song. Then say not ‘No’ unto my pray'r, But be so kind as thou art fayre. Why art thou with rare beauty blest? Only to bless mankynde, I wiss; Not for to robbe the harte of rest, But fill it with a sea of blisse. Then say not ‘No’ unto my pray'r, But be so kynde as thou art fayre. The sun was made to warme the earthe, And plenty make, and kepe off blite; So should thy beauty's sunne give birthe To our soul's harvests of delyte. Then say not ‘No’ unto my pray'r, But be so kynde as thou art fayre. ODE ON AN INCONSTANT. Those peerless lips are both forsworne; Those lips that roses blooms adorn, Ah, too deceiving fayre! I thought no guile upon thy tongue, I thought that mouth could say no wrong, Nor lay for hearts a snare. But now I see thy vaine, vaine mind, And now thy cruelty I find That taketh pride in woe: In every sigh thy guile I hear, And see my wrongs in ev'ry tear Which Sorrow bids to flow. Where'er I go, I hear thy name, And hear fierce Anger cry out ‘Shame!’ On beauty so renown'd. Know, beauty was design'd for joy, Which thou dost cruelly employ To give the world a wound. THE LOVER'S PITYE. My lute, who makedst sweetest sound, Awake thee now, alack! to playne; Sith my poore harte doth feel a wound, And never may rejoice again! Oh, let thy sounds with my sighs flow, For her who lies in death below! O lute! how jocund was thy voice When she did make thy chords rejoice, When roses blushed on her cheek! But now that she in deth lies pale, Thy voice must tell a doleful tale, And every harte with sorrow breake! My lute, thou must no more be gladde, But tune to dying straines and sadde, And think no more of jouissance. Grief openeth of myne eyes the springes, And oft my teares will wet thy stringes, And make thee mourne our dread mischance. Then list to me, my favourite lute— Be sadde, or lye for ever mute! TO A FLY. By the Princess Elizabeth, in Prison. Thou little animal, I wiss, Thou seemest me a child of bliss, And runnest, fleest here and there Withoute a pang, and eke a tear; While, borne to thinke of sceptres, I Do envy thee, thou little fly! Fortune doth make small giftes to me, But what is mine I give to thee: The bread, the wine upon my boarde, I yield to thee with much accorde. Come when thou list, and to thy mynde Thou something to thy taste shall fynde. Though gladde thou frisketh to and fro, Thy life, poor worme, is shorte, I know; A little while thy legs outspread, I see thee on the table ded; And, while thou art at peace, I wail, And think on thy lyfe's little tale. But while thou canst my crumbs enjoy, Thou here may hum withoute annoy; Runne here and there, and spread thy wing, And with thy own companions sing. Though man be cruel unto me, My hand shall give delyte to thee. ON THE FAYRE GERALDYNE. Goe, Muse to Hunsdon, and espye What giveth to myne harte a sighe; And yet to every other harte Bright floodes of joyance doeth emparte. There may thou see a sunne that cloude Did never yet with darkness shroude; And straunge, no mortals on that sunne Withouten hurte may looke uponne. Now, Lady Muse, should it be so, Thou doest not this my loadsterre knowe, Goe unto Hunsdon, caste thyne eien On all the world's fayre Geraldyne. THE BRENNED MOTH, A BALLADE. Ah! silly moth, what hast thou done? To such mishap why didst thou runne? Brent be thy legges, and eke thy wings, And Fate doth pierce thee with his stings. What folly could thy mynde perswade To leave thy fields of dew and shade, Where glow-worms light with lanterns sheen The little elves that praunce the green? There mightest thou on pennons light Enjoy the silence of mute nighte, And flicker hill and vale around, Withoute a foe—withoute a wound. Poor fly!—but why thy folly blame? We, wiser mortals, act the same! On mad ambitious fires we gaze, And, doating, perish in the blaze. WYATT TO BRYAN, FROM HIS PRISON. The summer of my hope is ded, Whyche made my daies, so passing fayre: Now Hope no more may lift her hed, Sore chilled by wynter of despayre. But, Bryan, my dark prison doore Doest boast of lyght when thou dost come; Syth Frendshipp's sun hath beames a store, To make a palace of a tombe. Then come, and Frendshipp's beame y spred, And I'll forget that Hope is ded. WYATT TO POINS, IN PRAISE OF LIBERTY. To crawle in courtes is bondage harde! For who y chooseth chaines I wot? Yet some, for pleasures of rewarde, Will flatter—and blow colde and hot. But Liberty will I emplore, Though Poverty knock at my doore. What be our wants?—some thinges, not all. Contentment lyeth not in heaps; Who hath a little field, though small, It grete is, if enough he reaps. Then Liberty will I emplore, Though Poverty knock at my doore. SIR T. WYATT. Retired to the Country, to Arlington, where he passed a Life of Tranquillity; he despised Harry the Eighth's Court.—Wyatt boasts of his Liberty. Free am I nowe—I courtes do follow not, But myne own pleasure dayly I persue; I aske aboute no courtiers—no, God wot, Sith I to courtes have bidden longe adieu: For when at courtes, on hands and knees they crawl, Like whipped dogs, and be for aye inthrall. When morne doth glister, oft bayte I myne hook, And forthe I go the river's bank besyde; And there I privilye do searche the brooke, And trye if fish unneath the surface glyde, And often do I bringe them to the lande, And then unhooke them with a happy hande. She whoame I love doth sumtime straye, And sees me dragge the pris'ner from the floude; And that it is most cruelle, she doth saye, To spille of little fish the harmless bloode. ‘Eche little fish,’ she telleth with a teare, ‘Which thou dost kille, perchaunce hath got his dere.’ And oft she pulleth a fish from my hande, And putteth him agayne into the brooke; Sayinge, ‘Go fishe, thyne liberty commande, And learne t'avoide, poor foole, the hyden hooke.’ And then she smylinge doth a moral fynde, And lykeneth fishe betray'd to woman-kynde. A BALLADE OF PRAYER, By Sir James Melville. Addressed to Queen Elizabeth, on his presuming to listen privately to her Majesty, while she played on the Virginals; delivered by Lord Hunsdon. Oh! in your gracious goodnesse deigne To pardon mee, most mighty queene, Who dared (not to be forgeven) To heare on erth the songes of Heaven! I strofe to flye from soche swete sounde, But nail'd was I unto the grounde; My feet, entraunced, could not move, And all my mynde was lost in love. What punishment your gracious sense Ordaineth for my rude offence, Yet be it grate, and life destroye, It may not equal my past joye. If you would more than cruel be, Deth must not be devis'd for me; But take my ears' quick sense away, When you, grate queene, shall singe and playe. BALLADE, By Vere, Earl of Oxford. Where is the mayde that erst was myne, Who did with love myne harte begile! No more on me doeth beauty shine, No more I proudly boaste her smile. The roses of her cheek so bright, Her lippe of berries' purple hue, No more for me may blush delyte; To them may Fansie say, adieu. When I did first her lookes beholde, Me seemes 'twas summer in her eye; Me seemes I mark'd two sunnes of golde, Upon her face's smiling skye. Me seemes that on her roseate cheeke I spyed the season of the springe; And when that she did courteous speke, The feather'd minstrels seem'd to singe. But all is past and gone, I weene: From her I meete with icy cold; I marke no more her eyes' bright sheen, Nor marke her sunnes of brightest golde. Sadde is the chaunge sith she's unkynde: Now cloudes all mirkie darke my daye; For Zephyrus blow wynter wyndes, And frost hath kill'd the gentle May. BALLADE. Couldst thou looke into myne harte, Thou wouldst see a mansion drear; Some old haunted tower aparte, Where the spectre bands appear: Sighing, gliding, ghostly forms, 'Mid the ruin shook by storms. Yet my harte, whiche Love doth slighte, Was a palace passing fair; Which did hold thyne image bright, Thee the queen of beauty rare; Which the laughing Pleasures fill'd, And fair Fortune's sunne did gild. When shall my poor harte, alas, Pleasure's palace be againe? That, sweete mayde, may come to pass, When thou ceasest thy disdaine: For thy smiles, like beams of day, Banish spectre forms away. A BALLADE. The maid who pants for lover's sighs, Doth lay for her own peace a snare; She rues the conquests of her eyes, And mourns that she was ever fair: Then, lasses, mind the proverb well, ‘Too oft the pitcher went to well.’ Where Beauty doth display its rose, In tribes the busy swains are found; And where the richest nect'rine grows, The hungry flies will buzz around: Then, lasses, mind the proverb well, ‘Too oft the pitcher went to well.’ THE THREAT OF OBERON THE FAIRY. Maidens fair, attend to me: Constant to your shepherds be: If ye break your vows of love, Ye my rage will sorely prove. I know all your dreams by night; Therefore fear, O maids, my spite: All your secret thoughts I know; Fear then my sharp anger's blow. And, O men! I pray, beware; Do not harm the maidens fair; Sigh not love, and then betray, If ye wish my rage away. By the moon's pure beam I swear, If I mark a virgin tear, I will give the shepherd dread, And will tear him from his bed. If I hear a shepherd sigh, Maids, in jeopardy ye lie; Spoil'd will be the dimple sleek, Breast of snow, and rosy cheek. Love our fairy train delights, While we sport in moony nights; Eke our elfin king and queene, As they gambol on the greene. Love was sent to soften wo, Sent to bless the world below; Full of smile, with roses crown'd: Why should Love then feel a wound? A BALLADE OF WYNTER. Loud blowe the wyndes with blustering breath And snows fall cold upon the heath, And hill and vale looke drear; The torrents foam with headlong roar, And trees their chilly loads deplore, And droppe the icy tear. The little birdes, with wishfull eye, For almes unto my cottage flye, Sithe they can boaste no hoarde: Sharpe in myne house the pilgrims peep, But Robin will not distance keepe, So percheth on my boarde. Now on the cradle doth he hye, And kenneth down, with connying eye, Upon my babe below; And finding comfort in my cote, He tweedles forth a simple note, And shakes his wings of snow. Come in, ye little minstrels swete, And from your feathers shake the sleete, And warme your freezing bloode: No cat shall touch a single plume; Come in, sweet choir—nay, fill my room, And take of grain a treat. Then flicker gay about my beams, And hoppe and doe what pleasaunt seemes, And be a joyfull throng, Till Spring may cloath the naked grove; Then go and build your nests, and love, And thank me with a song. TO HER HIGH MAJESTY, On her vouchsafing to reward her humblest of Servants, Edward Fairfax. Bright sun of England, nay, a sun, That hath so bright a cercle run, And on far realms doth spread a blaze! The humblest servant of your isle Doth thank your beauty for the smile That graceth me with golden rays. Though homely be my muse's speeche And poore, your praise can make it rich, Such is the power of your high name. What you, greet queen, may deign to praise, Although a dwarf you to a giant can it raise, Sith your voice is the voice of Fame. With a Gyfte of a Glow-worm to the fayre Geraldine, in the Country. Fayre Geraldine, behold, I bring This elfin imp that gildeth night; So beauteous was it 'mid the shade, So calm, so mild its lonely light, The insects of the dew-dropp'd fielde To its pure beame did homage yielde. When first I didde this worm espye, Aloude I said, and with a sighe, ‘Oh, little imp of night, I see Semblance of Geraldine in thee.’ Amid the shade as it doth shyne, So fares it with fayre Geraldine. This worm beneath the leaf doth hyde, Desyring not to be espied; Natheless it yieldeth all so brighte A jewel to emblazon night: And thus on this dark worlde do shyne The wit and charmes of Geraldine. BALLADE ON THE VIOLET. Sweete infant of the fielde, myne eye Doth joye thy modest form to spy, For thou goode news doth say; How winter, with his horrid yell, Hath bid at laste his rude farewell, And borne his blasts away. While Wynter his wilde rule did spread, Thou couldst not show thy tender head, But from his rage didst hide; And golden cup, and primrose pale, Did peeping tremble in their vale, And eke the daisie pied. The surly wight your robes had torne, And on his wings of tempest borne, And scatter'd through the skies; But now the gentle Zephyr's breath Doth whisper, ‘There's no dread of death,’ And bids you fearless rise. Sweet is thy lot, O little flower! Like man thou dost not life devour, Well pleas'd on dews to dine— Of Heaven's pure balm to make thy fayre: What pity 'tis we cannot share An innocence like thine. BALLADE TO A FISH OF THE BROOKE. Why flyest thou away, with fear? Trust me, there's nought of danger near, I have no wicked hooke, All cover'd with a snaring bait, Alas! to tempt thee to thy fate, And dragge thee from the brooke. O harmless tenant of the flood, I do not wish to spill thy blood; For Nature unto thee Perchance hath given a tender wife, And children dear, to charme thy life, As she hath done for me. Enjoy thy streame, O harmless fish; And when an angler, for his dish, Through Gluttony's vile sin, Attempts, a wretch, to pull thee out, God give thee strength, O gentle trout, To pull the raskall in! TO THE LARK. O little harbinger of day, Who welcomest the blushing light! With glee I list thy cheerful lay, Sweet recompence for dreary night. O'er fair Astræa's rosy bow'r, Go, tuneful sprite, and wave thy wing; Go, charm Astræa's morning hour, To her thy choicest ditties sing. For, if thou please that peerless queen, Thrice lucky were thy little voice; For when Astræa gladde is seen, Her smile doth all the world rejoice. ANCIENT SIMPLICITY. Folk be too fond of mounting Fortune's wheel; And though she humbleth thousands in the muck, Ambition's flame their brenning bosoms feel, Pardie! they must crawl up, and try their luck. But when aloft—themselves they scarcely know, Despisefull squinting on the world below: But when they tumble, none lament their thrall, But grin, and point their finger to their fall. To show that I am now not uttering lies, I'll tell a little tale in Æsop guise. THE YOUNG CROWS AND THE YOUNG WRENS. A Crow upon a lofty tree Did build her sticky nest; And younglings did she bring to light, In number five at least. One morning, on a summer's day, Did peep eche youngling crow, And spied upon a brambling bush Some youngling wrens below. These simple wrens in happy glee Did spread their little wing; And, lightsome, hopp'd from bush to bush, And merrily did sing. ‘Poor humble creatures,’ cry'd the crows, ‘Eche is a beggar wight; Look up to us, and see our state, Our houses lofty hight. ‘We look into the beamy skies, While you through hedges wade; We gaze upon the morning sun, While ye are lost in shade. ‘Poor imps, departe, nor here offend; Take off eche selie face; This hill was only made for crows, Then do not us disgrace. ‘If you do not this region quit, We'll dung upon you soon.’ The smiling wrens made answer none, But trill'd their little tune. Short time had pass'd, when suddenly Grim Boreas 'gan howl; The thunder crack'd, the lightning flash'd, And frighted man and fowl. While thus the dredefull thunder crack'd, And lightning broad did flash; The limb whereon the crows were perch'd Did give a sudden crash. Down came the limb, and with it down Did tumble eche young crow; Some broke their legs, and some their wings, And doleful look'd below. 'Twas now the time for wrens to jeer; So forth did fly the train, And, twittering, saw with smiles the crows All sprawling on the plain. Then taunting an arch wren began: ‘Sir Crows, of high renowne, Ye came, by this your dirty trim, All in a hurry down. ‘And by the looke of all your limbs, And feathers sous'd with rain, It will be some small time before Your graces mount again. ‘Proud fooles, how selie ye descend From skies to dirty fens! Thank Heaven, with hedges we're content, And happy to be wrens.’ TO AUTHORS That endite on the Passion of Love. Ye who do songs of love endite, Knoweth not well of that ye write, Sith ye nere with passion strove; Go moan, and hide in groves, and sighe, Adore her name, and wish to dye, And then ye well may wryte of love. But ye may answer make, and cry, ‘Where is the object for our sigh? Who is the mayde may make hearts pine?’ Ah, did ye never marke a mayde That wandereth in Windsor shade, Then larne—it is fayre Geraldine. BALLADE. When Summer's bloome did paynte my cheeke, I thought of Frendship's tye; Of Frendship I could onely speke, Unweting so was I. But now I fynde this grievous truthe, That frendship is the dream of youthe. Although I lov'd the fayrest mayde, My ladye I would yield, To give a frend a hand of aid, And be that frend's bold shield. But now I fynde, &amp;c. Alas, I mete with no return, For love I mete with hate; Instead of smyle myne eyes do mourne With early tears and late! But now I fynde, &amp;c. Frendship's a sunne, I whilom sayd, That warmeth every harte; But now that hartes of ice are made, Which Winter's colds emparte; But now I fynde, &amp;c. Frendship, sayd I, a forme doth boast, A gyant's forme, I ween; But nowe I see him, a poore ghost, With pale and dreary mien. But now I fynde, &amp;c. Then let no mynstrell, in his song, Of Frendship take the parte; Syth 'tis a vertue of the tongue, But never of the harte. But now I fynde, &amp;c. ODES. TO CYNTHIA IN TOWN. Cynthia, the Dryads are in tears, Because thou visit'st not their groves; The Graces grieve, and Cupid swears, And very sullen look the Loves. The Naiads through the vales declare, No rill of theirs shall purl away; The lark too scorns to mount in air, And vows to keep his nest all day. The sun resolves to hide his head, And blot his lustre from the skies; Yet that were little loss indeed, While we possess'd that pair of eyes. Well then, to pique thee, from each lay, From all my lines I'll blot thy name. ‘Aye, do,’ I hear thee smiling say, ‘And blot what only gives them fame.’ ODE. [Tempora mutantur.] The Poet describeth the former and present State of his Wishes. Tempora mutantur. Courtiers are just so many goats—that leap From rock to rock, upon the cloud-capp'd steep, That overhangs a sea that foams around; Slip but a foot! souse! down they are, and drown'd: Yet how folks scramble, one and all, To mount the ridge, and get a fall! I own'd I've listen'd to Ambition's tales, Sigh'd for Life's mountains, and disdain'd its vales; My youngling ears most greedy drank her story! With kings and queens, Lord! how was I in love! Tried to make wings (alas! I vainly strove) Poor fly! to buzz within their orbs of glory. Yes, vain were my endeavours all, And still am I ordain'd to crawl! Although so lofty in my rhime. Heavens! how my fibres felt the rack, When Pye obtain'd the royal sack, And Parsons smooth'd the ode with chime! Thus can't I to the palace go, alack! All the court crawlers would be on my back; Biting and scratching, nibbling, swarming— A circumstance, alas! alarming. There would be Liverpool, I do suppose, And Cardigan, and Salisb'ry, and Rose, Making a diabolic rout: ‘Off with him—turn the fellow out!’ Cut off from Cæsar and his wife, I pass of solitude a life; To Cynthia's beauty tune the willing lyre; And while I gain her lovely smile, (The sweetest that adorns our isle!) I feel for courts no more a fierce desire: So little raptur'd with a royal mien, I would not give one pin to kiss a queen. ODE ON THE ANCIENTS. ‘All has been said—the world has nought to yield: Alas! there's nothing new beneath the sun: The ancients with their hooks have reap'd the field; All that can be imagin'd has been done. The ancients for the moderns were too stout; Yes! the deep mine of knowledge is work'd out.’ So cries the world! but who are these that speak? Men of no nous, most wonderfully weak! If things are so, why, what a fate is mine! Lord help the muse! she never penn'd a line. Reap the whole field! not half on't, I'll be sworn: They've only taken a few sheaves of corn. The mine exhausted! Poh! I'll hear no more— They've only gather'd a few grains of ore. Appear but Genius, Genius soon will find New matter to improve and charm mankind; Teach on the wildest heath the rose to blow: Genius, the rod of Moses at the rock, Shall, by a magical and happy stroke, Bid the rich stream of wit and wisdom flow. The brains of men, in general, are a pool, Wrapp'd in death-stillness, comfortably dull; Like motionless poor Lethe, void of spirit. But now and then (like Milton, for example, Or Shakespeare, each indeed a beauteous sample), Into existence pops a wight of merit: An ocean, lo, his brave ideas rise, That mounts, and with its thunders shakes the skies! ODE TO AN UNFORTUNATE PRINCESS. Shall Virtue feel the cruel blow, Her tears to earth unheeded flow, Her soul unheard complain? Say, will no muse proclaim the wrong? Why sleeps the thunder of her song, While Pity mourns in vain? With every beauty to inspire Of Love the soft and chaste desire, And bless the nuptial tie; With every gentler charm of mind, Can Fate, to peerless worth unkind, Condemn thy heart to sigh? Without a friend, in soothing strain, To steal thy bosom from its pain, I hear thy plaintive voice; And hear the snakes of envy hiss, While, happy at thy vanish'd bliss, The imps of Hell rejoice. Yet through the cloud that hides thy head, By Calumny's foul venom spread, I mark a golden ray; Time on his wing (for Justice reigns) To calm thy life's tempestuous scenes, Shall waft the smiles of May. Hark! to suppress the swelling tear, A voice prophetic hails thine ear: ‘Thy babe shall rule ador'd; On Britain's throne, to crown her fame, The shouts of millions shall proclaim Eliza's reign restor'd.’ ODE TO ST. CECILIA. O Goddess of the tuneful quire, Upon my knees I must desire You'll give your instrument a smart jobation: Happy am I a band to meet, To give my ears a pretty treat, And fill my heart with sweetest animation. I like an overture, I needs must own— Of music 'tis a very noble dish: But here's the devil—while some with solemn groan, Bawl flesh, lo, others are exclaiming fish; Rending with sounds of Babel our poor ears, Much like the noises of the bulls and bears At the Stock-Exchange.. Proud on his nimbler neighbour to advance, Like elephants that fain would learn to dance, The double bass attempts his awkward jigs, Grunting and snuffling like a sow and pigs. Ambitious, this most lab'ring bass Gives to the violincello chase, Who on the tenor presses like the wind, Who presses closely on the second fiddle, Who presses sharply on first tweedle-tweedle, Who leaps the bridge, and leaves them all behind. Alas! are these the modes to melt the soul, Sooth ev'ry sigh, and ev'ry care control? If this be music, let me leave the riot, And be the world of quavers ever quiet! PETER'S TRIUMPH. TO THE MUSE. Muse, we have finish'd now our odes, And verily the songs of gods; But let me tell thee, muse, and much it pains, That those great traffickers in words, Those high and mighty pompous lords, The booksellers, will barely give me grains! ‘Hog's wash is good enough’—they cry: Thus can I neither roast nor fry. 'Tis hard that my poor mental mill Is never suffered to lie still; Such, such indeed the avarice of the clan: Forc'd, ev'ry minute of the hour, To grind, forsooth, for them the flour, And feed myself, alas! upon the bran. Hard is their bridle—Lord! with pains I shrink; Too hard upon my bleeding jaws they pull! What shame that they, the lazy imps, should drink Claret and Burgundy from my poor skull; And, with a saucy mortifying sneer, Bid me be happy upon dead small beer. I boast one consolation, I allow— My name will never be forgotten: When to Posterity I make my bow, Those rogues are in oblivion rotten. A POETICAL EPISTLE TO BENJAMIN COUNT RUMFORD, Knight of the White Eagle, &amp;c. &amp;c. Muse, at the sound of Rumford raise thy voice, And bid our kitchen furniture rejoice! Though scant our store, a hempen string, alack! (The simple substitute for spit and jack) A knife and fork, a dish, a spoon and platter, Shall stir their stumps, and make a jovial clatter; The broom shall hop, as merry as a grig; And, pleas'd, the dainty dishclout dance a jig. The bard whose harp immortaliz'd the louse, For which he ne'er receiv'd a single souse; Prais'd Madam Schwellenberg Though I have here accused this lady of ingratitude; perhaps, if her last will and testament were to be seen, I might alter my opinion.—Where is this will, I wonder?—Why does it not appear at Doctors' Commons? Is it ashamed to show its face? What has it done with the pearls and diamonds, presents from the poor persecuted family of the Hastings?—Is it with the tailor in Pimlico, to whom her poor body was sent about an hour or two after the soul had forsaken its tenement!—Should not this will be publicly advertised?—Am I certain that it doth not contain some handsome bequest; at least a tender memorial to me, who (she very well knew) must lose much by her death?—Is this an unreasonable conjecture? I know the will has been read, and I know parts of it.—O ye poor relations of Madam Schwellenberg, now crawling in piteous plight in obscure holes in Germany, must ye forfeit the little pittance bequeathed, if ye dare approach Great Britain? Such was a cruel clause of the will!—Had ye enough to purchase mourning, O ye poor disappointed relations of Madam Schwellenberg? Perhaps ye might have been troublesome, had ye come to England—if so, things are best as they are. in lofty style, For which he never gain'd a single smile; Gave to eternity the shaven group, Yet never saw a ladle-full of soup; Prais'd thankless lords besides, and knight and 'squire— Now to a Yankey tunes the willing lyre: Spite of th' ingratitude of cooks and ? Strikes to Count Rumford's tuneful name the strings, Who from his fav'rite little Rumford Once an obscure village, in North America, but fortunately illuminated by the nativity of the Count, who, indeed, drew his first breath there, and afterwards, in quality of a pedagogue, immortalized it by his abecedarian powers, teaching little children to read, spell, and write, with the most consummate ability. came, To build on smoke his fortune, and his fame. Muse, at the sound of Rumford raise thy voice, And bid our kitchen furniture rejoice! Though scant our store, a hempen string, alack! (The simple substitute for spit and jack) A knife and fork, a dish, a spoon, and platter, Shall stir their stumps, and make a jovial clatter; The broom shall hop, as merry as a grig; And, pleas'd, the dainty dishclout dance a jig; Expressing thus in gratitude their souls To him whose wisdom saves us pecks of coals; And means (for Pitt's d?mn'd taxes this require) To teach us soon to roast without a fire. Friend to thy fame (and may it last thee long!) Though G? and Banks grow jealous of the song; Howe'er its praise may wound some courtly folk, That song shall thunder to the man of smoke! Knight of the dishclout, wheresoe'er I walk, I hear thee, Rumford, all the kitchen talk: Note of melodious cadence on the ear, Loud echoes Rumford here, and Rumford there! Lo, every parlour, drawing-room I see, Boasts of thy stoves, and talks of nought but thee. Yet, not alone my lady and young misses, The cooks themselves could smother thee with kisses! Yes! Mistress Cook would spoil a goose, or steak, To twine her greasy arms around thy neck. Through newspaper, through magazine, review, Happy mine eyes thy splendid track pursue— Thy sage opinion in each journal read— A vein of silver 'midst a load of lead! High o'er the wond'ring world Vanbutchell tow'rs, And on the ruptur'd mob his trusses pours:— High mounted Katerfelto and his cat, Proud of the voice of Fame, in glory sat:— High o'er the world the mighty Merlin sits, Though much of gall his jealous mouth emits! Endeavouring, lo, thy name's bright beam to shade, The wizard swears that thou hast stol'n his trade Indeed Mr. Merlin has seemingly just cause of complaint: but as the minds of those great men are surprisingly similar, why may not a coincidence of thought occasionally take place, and produce similar discoveries?; Learn'd from his matchless art to conjure up. From shades below, a shilling's-worth of soup; And mean'st on other tricks to put thy pats; Plunder chair-yelping curs, and squawling cats; With all their love-songs of sweet execution, To please and lull the Royal Institution.— High o'er the world Sir Joseph soars sublime, The great and fertile subject of my rhime!— Yet higher thou shalt mount, whose angry toe Kick'd from thy shop Sir J. Banks is bonâ fidê ousted; and poor Garnet, a most ingenious chemist, was attacked for a difference in opinion. the hero of Soho; And aiming, too, at Garnet's luckless crown, Didst, with thy leaden journal, knock him down: For who with sage opinion, dares appear, While Rumford's mouth of oracles is near? Behold the elector bowing to his merit! Bavaria owns his beggar-hunting spirit; Who, when poor Munich trembled, almost lost, With god-like ardour pierc'd the Egyptian host, And seiz'd (which history must ever note) And seiz'd!—a daring gipsey by the throat Here I must beg pardon of my readers for violating history.—The Count slightly says, that at the head of the elector's troops he made but one gipsey his prisoner, and that he only tapped him on the shoulder.—Such is the Count's modesty.—A hero is the last man in the world to speak of his own exploits; but let me quote the Count's own words, who, like Cæsar, can write as well as fight. ‘New-year's Day,’ says the Count in his history, ‘having from time immemorial been considered in Bavaria as a day peculiarly set apart for giving alms, and the beggars never failing to be all out on that occasion; I chose that moment, as being the most favourable to my operations. Early in the morning of the first of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety, the officers and non-commissioned officers of the three regiments of infantry in garrison were stationed in the different streets, where they were directed to wait for further orders. ‘Having in the mean time assembled at my lodgings the field officers and all the chief magistrates of the town, I made them acquainted with my intention, to proceed that very morning to the execution of a plan I had formed, for taking up the beggars, and asked their immediate assistance. ‘To show the public that it was not my wish to carry this measure into execution, by military force alone (which might have rendered the measure odious), but that I was disposed to show all becoming deference to the civil authority, I begged the magistrates to accompany me, and the field officers of the garrison, in the execution of the first and most difficult part of the undertaking, that of arresting the beggars. This they most readily consented to, and we immediately sallied out in the street, myself accompanied by the chief magistrate of the town, and each of the field officers by an inferior magistrate. We were hardly got into the street, when we were accosted by a beggar, who asked us for alms. I went up to him, and laying my hand gently on his shoulder, told him from henceforwards begging would not be permitted in Munich. I then delivered him over to the orderly serjeant; and then turning to the officers and magistrates who accompanied me, I begged they would take notice that I had myself, with my own hands, arrested the first beggar,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. Vide the Count's Essays, vol. 1. p. 41. third edition. Such is the Count's elegant and nervous narrative of that glorious day which emancipated Munich from the tyranny of the beggars? With the hero of antiquity, the Count Rumford may not only say, Veni, vidi, vici, but moreover add, scripsi, to increase the catalogue of his wonders.; And gave him (what such bravery can reward!) And gave him!—to the serjeant of the guard— For which th' elector deck'd the man of stove, With true-blue ribbons, and the bird of Jove! Great Man! whose pow'r inventive daily rakes Balm from a bog His first and grand object being to complete the sum of total of human happiness, by a prudent attention to economy, he shows how from the recrementitious/excrementitious parts of human food and fuel, as well as from many hitherto shamefully neglected natural productions, to derive a wholesome and pleasing and nutritious diet.—There is a filthy old proverb (that I cannot repeat) instructing people how to grow rich;—and which proverb, though treated as ludicrous by our ancestors, will be soon pronounced a serious œconomical maxim. After many laborious days and sleepless nights, the Count has at last succeeded in the detection of that grand desideratum, before and since the days of the great Martinus Scriblerus, viz. the extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers; so that any gentleman may store up heat and light for the winter, in the same way ice is preserved for the summer. This fortunate discovery (it will be observed) supersedes all his former methods of saving fuel, and consequently precludes all further researches in the consolidatuon of smoke and the conversion of soot into sea-coal., and dinners from a j?kes! Great man! whose fertile genius could contrive To soften rocks, and flay the flints alive With a machine which the Count invented on the Continent, he flays flints, and by an alkali sui generis converts them into palatable soups and jellies; and he is now carrying on a process for preparing their skins to make purses for such as have money, and tobacco-pouches for such as have none. The philosophical tinkers and bellows-menders, whose ideas he has generously adopted, make kettles, saucepans, frying-pans, salamanders, skillets, stewers, roasters, toasters, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the most astonishing and unheard-of powers; some of these utensils rendering shoe-leather as masticable as beef-steaks, and the toughest horse-hide as tender as the best veal in Leadenhall Market. By a little higher charge of heat, bones, hair, horns, hoof, shells and claws, are reduced to a jelly; and chopped straw, bean-husks, potatoe-skins, &amp;c. are turned into palatable spoon-meat. The extensive use and application of these inventions, especially in the present times of famine, must be obvious to the intelligent.—Already the workmen are so far reconciled to this new species of food that they begin to make themselves comfortable messes of their old aprons and leather breeches. In short, the Count is not without hopes of introducing the animal food of the ancient and modern Scythians, and the more cooling vegetable diet of King Nebuchadnezzar.; And make (though Envy unbelieving grins) Pouches and handsome purses of their skins; Nay more (but yet, methinks, a dangerous hint) To perfect jelly turn the hardest flint: For, hence an inconvenience may arise— To this discovery rogues will turn their eyes: The felons dread, for robbery, murder, rape, Will eat their various dwellings, and escape; Taught by thine art of turning stones to jellies, Fly with the walls of Newgate in their bellies. Great man! whose tinkers form, from various metals, Grillers and broilers, salamanders, kettles! Steamers and bakers, frying-pans and stewers, Skillets and saucepans, roasters, toasters, brewers. Some, blest indeed with such stupendous pow'r, Shall change old shoes to beef in half an hour; And turn, amidst the wonders of the shop, The tinker's apron to a mutton chop. Bones, oyster-shells, and hair, and hoofs, and claws, Shall form, too, jellies for the nicest jaws: Thus shall the cuckold, who his honours scorns, Bless his dear wife, and fatten on his horns! Great king of fire, who know'st the pow'rs of meat, And know'st how necessary 'tis to eat; And yet, not only eat, but eat with pleasure, Without one bit of bolting—quite at leisure! By which slow movement in the mastication, Millions may soon be sav'd to this poor nation! What gratitude, what thanks, to thee are due, Instructing a great empire how to chew! In work-houses, where ignorance abounds, And all the poor, voracious, feed like hounds, Sharp overseers shall at the table stand, And give the word, with serjeant-like command: Thus will their crackling jaws in concert chime, And, like a fiddler's elbow, move in time. Oh! if I, too, The experimental dinners promised by the Count, are expected by the members of the R. I. with great avidity.—Grass broth, flint soup, fricasseed leather-breeches, stewed old shoes, &amp;c. &amp;c. will soon be forth-coming, set on the able, too, by automatical waiters, to the vast surprise and instruction of all beholders!!! might cater for the belly, Old fiddle-strings should make us vermicelli; Cockchaffers, with a very trifling art, Compose a pie—at least a pretty tart; Soap-suds to syllabubs and trifles change, And bullocks' lights and livers to bla'mange; And sheep's-dung, without quantities of studying, Glean'd from the fields, produce a fine plum-pudding. A wool-stuff'd pin-cushion would make a puff, And tripe start forth from breeches of old buff; And, with Sir Joseph's leave, with fish might pass His fleas, his fav'rite fleas, for lobster-sauce. But what an insolence in me to prate! Pretend to him to open Wisdom's gate, Who spurns advice, like weeds, where'er it springs, Disdaining counsel Here I must beg leave to quarrel with the Count.—Although a man may, like the Count, possess extraordinary intellect, and although a man may be the best judge of himself, nevertheless it is indecorous to treat the opinions of others with contempt.—The Count's constant assertion is, ‘I never was yet in the wrong—I know every thing.’ Granting this to be true, the declaration is nevertheless arrogant and supercilious., though it comes from kings. Yet say, why physic ‘All discussion relative to religion and medicine will be carefully avoided.’—Journal of the Royal Institution of Great Britain. from thy house exclude? On physic, ponder—what a public good! Hygeia weeps, poor nymph, to be neglected— Shame on thee! let the fair-one be protected— Of physic didst thou never own the skill? Say, did thy purity ne'er need a pill? Go, go! harangue the members—goad 'em, goad 'em! And make them send away for Doctor Brodum; Or Doctor Meyrsbach, who with sapience sees A mighty empire fall by toasted cheese: Or doughty Doctor Solomon invite, Who cuts the talons of Disease, the kite, That hov'ring, threat'ning, spread abroad, prepare To lug us goslings to the fields of air. And why Divinity be banish'd, pray? Souls are of some importance, let me say. In God's name, send a card to Rowland Hill, Who to a tittle knows his Maker's will: The film of darkness banish'd from his eyes, He kens the darkest secrets of the skies; Of cherubim and seraphim the host, As though they wrote the parson ev'ry post. Hill knows what Satan does, and means to do; Knows all the plottings of th' infernal crew; The tools, the tortures for a sinful soul; And what the fire to roast it—wood or coal; Oh, while mechanics hold with thee a sway, And blacksmiths, tinkers, hammer it away— While such obtain thy smile, a lucky lot, Let not ingenious Aris be forgot! To shine a worthy member, Aris sighs— Aloft his excellency lifts his eyes: Pitt's bosom friend, O grant him then his pray'r, Whose gags and hand-cuffs, wondrous worth declare; Whose whips of thong, to radiant wire allied, Tickle with neatest touch the human hide. With rapture have I visited thy house, And marvell'd at thy vast extent of nous, Thanks to thy care that, 'midst its ample round, Soup, tea and toast, ‘To render the house of the Institution more pleasant and agreeable to such proprietors and subscribers as frequent it, an additional room has lately been set apart for their private and exclusive use:—this has been called the conversation room, and is distinguished by an inscription over the door. As conversation in the reading rooms could not fail to interrupt those who read, the managers are confident, that all those who frequent the house will be so sensible of the reasonableness of the regulation, as to abstain from conversation in the reading rooms when any person engaged in reading is present. ‘To render the conversation room still more useful and agreeable, it will be furnished with a collection of good maps; and, as soon as some necessary previous arrangements (which are now actually making) shall be finished, those who frequent this room will be furnished, at the most reasonable prices, from the housekeeper's room below, with soups of various kinds, tea, coffee, chocolate, and other refreshments.’—Vide the Count's Journal. and coffee may be found, And wine, and punch, and porter, fresh'ning draught, Mending the monstrous wear and tear of thought.— Thus a new birth shall Rumford's glory tell, And from its bowels spring a grand hotel! Yet 'mid thine house's philosophic glooms, Since conversation has its private rooms, Extend the thought by love delicious led; And give of Graham the celestial bed! In would subscriptions like a torrent pour! Nymphs of delight would leave each Cyprian bower— The bond-street loungers to thy call repair, And form, like Smithfield, a perpetual fair. Say, canst thou make (whose brains have not their fellows) Fire blow itself without a pair of bellows? Soon shall we see a haunch, with equal wit, Turn round and roast itself without a spit; Fish without frying-pans come hot and hot, And dumplings boil themselves without a pot Nay more, Automata shall rise!—I see A pin pursue, and pierce the nimble flea; Now in the bedstead old, or in the rug, Pluck from its lurking hole the wounded bug:— Untouch'd, the handkerchief shall wrap the nose; Untouch'd, the pen-knife cut the corn-clad toes; Untouch'd, the comb the vermin tribe assail, And scissars opening clip the finger nail— The soap unaided the rich suds shall spread, And razors trimly shave the beard and head; Formal as Pitt the treasury bench shall rise, And, bowing, ope the budget for supplies; The church's desk put forth its pious pray'rs, And Lincoln's pulpit preach like Parson Nares. A staunch stickling parson for preferment, the salvation of souls, and the state.—Newspapers, pamphlets, magazines, reviews, ballads, &amp;c. proclaim the merits of our Lincoln's-Inn preacher.—The pulpit itself is a weekly witness of his various enthusiasm—He does not yet deem himself properly remunerated—Is there nothing more for the poor gaping priest? Great man! the culinary tactics studying, Instructing worlds to eat a hasty pudding— ‘The hasty pudding being spread out equally on a plate, while hot, an excavation is made in the middle of it, with a spoon; into which excavation a piece of butter, as large as a nutmeg, is put; and upon it a spoonful of brown sugar, or, more commonly, molasses. The butter being soon melted by the heat of the pudding, mixes with the sugar or molasses, and forms a sauce; which being confined in the excavation made for it, occupies the middle of the plate. The pudding is then eaten with—a spoon, each spoonful of it being dipt into the sauce, before it is carried to the mouth; care being had, in taking it up, to begin on the outside, or near the brim of the plate; and to approach the centre by regular advances, in order not to demolish too soon the excavation which forms the reservoir for the sauce.’ Such are the Count's culinary tactics in regard to the siege of a hasty pudding. Nobler generalship perhaps was never exhibited by Marlborough, Turenne, or even Bonaparte himself. To thee poor poets shall their offerings bring, Who roast like me, their victuals by a string, All struggling with a laudable intention, Who best shall praise thee for thy vast invention. And since thy skill (believe me not in joke) Contriveth traps to catch our London smoke; Soon, very soon, mayst thou proclaim aloud (Rare news for farmers), traps to catch a cloud— Quick on his pris'ner Hob will lay his hands, And tap his watery belly for the lands; And thus our parsons will be sav'd the pain Of putting Heaven in mind to send down rain. O why will Scandal thus let loose her tongue, And call the voice of Knowledge, Folly's song? Great are the beauties of association! What charming union, soup and conversation! Assisting each the other with delight; Thus babes are pleas'd their alphabet to bite; And thus, without the harmless fraud discerning, With gingerbread the urchins swallow learning.— I know that Envy turns her head away, And calls the Institution puppet play; But, ah! in censure people should be mild; Philosophy herself was once a child: Yet still those rude sounds stab mine ear's poor drum; ‘A bite—palaver—nonsense, fudge, a hum.’ In vain wits call thee (blasting thy machines) ‘A walking bundle of old magazines.’ Believe me, immortality is sure: Long as thy chimneys shall thy praise endure; Oblivion ne'er shall swallow Rumford's name: Aloft ascending, lo, thy radiant fame, With thy own curling clouds of smoke shall rise, And sun-like give them lustre on the skies! I know they mock thee (in their laughter loose) Because thou sweep'st a chimney with a goose The Count certainly lays claim to the invention of sweeping chimneys with a goose, by forcing down the animal alive, with a string about its neck, from the top of the chimney; when the poor creature, by flapping its wings, as it is pulled up and down, sends the soot about its business: but it is really an Irish discovery, used also to extinguish fires in chimneys, by which means the goose becomes roasted at no expense. No bad hint this, for the Count's œconomical system!; I know the world a jealous spirit fosters, And christens thee the weakest of impostors; 'Stead of a war-horse, one of Folly's hacks; The prince, the king, the emp'ror of the quacks. Sir Joseph of thy journals makes his sport; Laughs at thy dinners Take, gentle reader, the Count's own words from his own Journal, on the subject of what he calls experimental dinners:—‘In order that the proprietors and subscribers may be enabled to judge, from actual experiment, of the merit of any new method of cooking, or of any new dish that may be proposed, a dining-room has been built, and will soon be ready for use, at the house of the Institution, in which the managers will occasionally order experimental dinners, to which the proprietors and subscribers will be invited, as far as the accommodation will admit; the expense of such dinners to be defrayed by those who partake of them.’, keeps thee from our court, Or long, long since hadst thou reeceiv'd commands To come and lounge at levees, and kiss hands. Yes! to eclipse thy blaze, behold him strain, And rummage the dark coal-hole of his brain; But not one nob is in it, do not doubt: All, long ago, (believe me) all burnt out! Too plain I see him (jealous of thy name), Try ev'ry jockey trick to pass thy fame: In vain! the fates against the knight combine— Strive as he list, the glorious race is thine: To snap more snakes, Sir Joseph means, I know, And swallow alligators in Soho: More tadpoles down his cable gullet pour, And frogs, and butterflies a mealy show'r: From hieroglyphics a new name he seeks, And tastes and pores on Babylonian bricks: Still, with his 'squire Honest Jonas Dryander, the sine quo non of Sir Joseph., the knight in fancy sees Fame in his blankets—lobsters lodg'd in fleas; And swearing that in future nought shall foil 'em, Has order'd honest Jonas to reboil 'em. Unrivall'd Rumford, ere I close my song, Hear, hear an oracle from Peter's tongue: Great scholarship with wisdom link'd are rare; Yet these unite in thee, I do declare— For scholars seldom are the most discerning: 'Tis true, each Priscian swallows loads of learning; Yet a poor moth (that paper-idolizer) Devouring wit, but not a whit the wiser. O since, from ev'ry corner of our isle, Books court thy hand to gain thy gracious smile; Regard my offer, nor the trifle slight; Receive a poet's solitary mite; A little incense to embalm thy shrine; A life exceedingly resembling thine; The hist'ry of that hero with a hunch— The laughable, th' immortal Mister Punch. THE ISLAND OF INNOCENCE; A POETICAL EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. Yes, on thy simple isle, in Fancy's eye, Envying I often look, and often sigh In fancy rove thy small domain by day, And, pleas'd, with thee in nightly visions stray. To thee, my friend A gentleman whom the author of this poem met by the merest accident, on a small island situated near the Gulf of Mexico.—His companions were his wife, a most lovely woman, and four beautiful children, whose history would form an interesting romance:—persecuted by their parents for a mutual love attachment, they forsook their native country (America), to seek some distant asylum. On their voyage they were wrecked; but fortunately escaped with their lives, and preserved their property. Finding the little island on which they were thrown, to be in possession of a few inhabitants of the most perfect simplicity of manners, and the most lively friendship; pleased also with the salubrity as well as beauty and fertility of the spot, they adopted the resolution of passing their days in this remote corner of the globe; convinced that the most perfect happiness resides oftener in simplicity than splendour. Their opinion soon became realised: fond of the innocent natives, and equally beloved again, the delightful little republic flourished under their auspices, and restored the golden age., amid that peaceful Isle, Where bounteous Nature blooms with sweetest smile; Where never Winter, on his northern blast, Howls on the hill, and lays the valley waste; O'er a pale sun, the cloud of horror throws, And buries Nature in his vast of snows; Ah, no! where endless Summer, ever gay, Opes a pure ether to the orb of day; That gilds the tree, and flower, and grassy blade, And works his threads of gold in ev'ry glade; To thee, my friend, where shrubs of incense rise, And pour their grateful fragrance to the skies; Where rills, in wanton mazes, wind away, Diffusing health and plenty, as they play; Where the rich treasures of the pine reside, And orange-branches bend with golden pride; Where from the boughs of odour, mingled notes Of rapture warble from a thousand throats; And blest, from vale to vale the cooing dove Wings with his mate, and teaches man to love; To thee, I yield the Muse's artless line, And envy all the blessings that are thine. Yes, on thy simple isle, in fancy's eye, Envying I often look, and often sigh; In fancy rove thy small domain by day, And, pleas'd, with thee in nightly visions stray; Behold thee happy at thy wonted toil, And mark the blossoms of a fruitful soil: While at thy side thy Julia plants the ground, With all her little progeny around; Who study shrubs and flow'rs with eager eyes, And learn of simple Nature to be wise. Pleas'd to explore the insect world, they rove, Tribes of the flood, and minstrels of the grove; With all the varying species of the field, Whose forms and lives delight, and wisdom yield; Display the page of Providence's plan, That shows his wondrous works to wond'ring man. No wish is theirs (forbid it, Heav'n!) to hurt, To wound, and murder a poor wretch in sport; To lift the tube of death, with hostile eye, And dash a fluttering victim from his sky; To bait with writhing worms the barb'rous hook, And drag the finny nation from their brook: Justly forbid the cruelty to know, And gather pleasure from the pangs of woe! Blest on their boughs, the squirrel tribes they see, And call the hungry urchins from their tree, Who, fearless, hast'ning at the kind command, Fly to their food, and court th' extended hand; Now scud in playful gambols o'er the plain, And, fully feasted, seek their groves again. And now they beckon to the feather'd throng; Forth fly, in flocks, the little bands of song; They hop, and chirp, and flutter round each head, Pleas'd to be call'd, and anxious to be fed. At length content, they flicker to their spray, Adjust their plumes, and pour the thankful lay. Now, happy, to the stream they haste to feed, With liberal hand, the little finny breed: Fearless of danger, lo, the sportive fry, Mount to the water's brim with watchful eye, And leaping oft as urging hunger calls, Meet the dropp'd crumb, and catch it ere it falls. Such are the blisses of thy girls and boys, And such the blisses innocence enjoys. Oh, when will Britons list to reason's voice, And, chang'd, no more in cruelty rejoice? How nobler thus t'address the harmless hare: ‘Child of the field, O come beneath my care; Safe in thy lonely slumber pass the day, Along the moonlight hills in safety stray; No dog is mine, nor engine that destroys; Peace to thy loves, and all thy nightly joys: When Heav'n's kind bounty made those valleys mine, Heav'n made the freedom of those valleys thine.’ How nobler to the winter's bird The Woodcock. to say, ‘Poor stranger, welcome from thy stormy way, Drop in my groves, enjoy the tepid springs, And lodg'd in peace, repose thy wearied wings; The food and shelter of my valleys share: Like me, a child of Providence's care.’ How nobler to the finny tribe to say, ‘Yours be the rills that 'midst my pastures stray; Enjoy your sports, enjoy the sunny beam; Health form your food, and wholesome keep your stream; Torn be the net, and broken be the hook, That wanton carry death into your brook; The Pow'r who gave to mortals ev'ry good, Forgets not yours, his infants of the flood.’ Humanity, how few thy merits see! How scarce the altars that are rais'd to thee! Nymph of the tender heart, and melting eye, Vain o'er the savage Million is the sigh! O could thy gentle spirit more impart Of softness, sweetness, to the human heart! But lo, by cruel Nature led astray, The ruder passions rule with boisterous sway; Drown'd is thy voice—a zephyr's sigh—no more! The murm'ring rill 'midst ocean's mighty roar! On plumes of down, my friend, thy moments fly, Peace in thy heart, and pleasure in thine eye! Thy cot, though humble, all the virtues there, Forbid an entrance to a sigh or tear. Yes! oft in fancy's eye thy cot I view Enwrapp'd with vines and flow'rs of vivid hue; The pebbled avenue, the murm'ring spring, Crowded with fearless birds of various wing, That sportive flutter, pouring happy lay, A mingled minstrelsy the live-long day; And oft, on fancy's ear, thy Julia's lute, Whose melting sounds the soul of pity suit, Complaining die; and oft I hear again A loud, a happy, cheerful grateful strain, Join'd by a little offspring's throats that raise The song of wonder in their Maker's praise. Sweet is the humble pray'r that Heav'n implores! Divine the voice of mortal that adores In fancy, too, I see, beneath thy care, The simple natives at thy stories stare Of street and churches, palaces and tow'rs, And busy million that through London pours; And animals that stately, stout, and strong, Drag to a rout a golden house along; Alas! with many a wondrous sight beside, Begot by luxury, and nurs'd by pride. Yet fond of these our wonders should they sigh, And cast to Britain's scenes a wishful eye; O give the hist'ry of our horrid deeds; Proclaim how love laments, and friendship bleeds! How virtue pines, how merit hides the head, And pity steals to tombs, to mourn the dead: Paint all the horrors of domestic strife, And give the gilded snares of polish'd life; Tell tales of Fortune, at whose tinsel shine, Fools daily kneel, and for her favour pine; Who, when she yields, means only to beguile— Fate in her hand, and ruin in her smile. O paint our dungeons, where, with putrid breath, The wretch, desponding, pants, and sighs for death: Paint the poor felon, doom'd, ah! doom'd to die, Wan the pale cheek, and horror-struck the eye; With languid limbs that droop to earth in pain, Press'd, loaded, lab'ring with a clanking chain; While, on the stillness of the midnight air, Sad moans the voice of Mis'ry and Despair: Paint all the horrors of the midnight shade, Theft's iron crow, and Murder's reeking blade. Paint the poor objects that we hourly meet, The wrecks of beauty crowding every street; Daughters of Innocence, ere Demon Art Won on the weakness of too soft a heart; And doom'd to infamy the tender kiss, Due to pure love alone and wedded bliss. Paint courts, whose sorceries, too seducing bind, In chains, in shameful slavish chains, the mind; Courts, where unblushing Flatt'ry finds the way, And casts a cloud o'er Truth's eternal ray. And quote the sage A philosopher named Alexander, the friend of Crassus., who courts had serv'd and known:— ‘O Crassus, let me fly, and live alone: Though much I love thee, let our commerce end, Nor from his solitude recall thy friend. Thanks to the gods, my servile hours are o'er, And, oh, let Mem'ry mention courts no more!’ Behold the courtier—there the eye surveys A willow crawling to each form with ease: But mark the man in rigid virtue bred, An oak! in majesty he lifts the head; Asserts his freedom, base controul defies, And tow'ring hides his branches in the skies. Friend of my heart, nor let thy sail unfold, To court Peru, with all her hills of gold; Nor court her sister Mexico, whose ore, Possess'd by demons, curses ev'ry shore! The splendid mischief usher'd to thy vale, What but a plague that taints with death the gale? Too soon the imp would blast the sacred scene, And damn of innocence the cherub reign! Fame, Justice, own th' omnipotence of gold; Nay, blushing modesty herself is sold. Alas! one virtue more illumes the mind: Then all its envied wealth illumines Ind. Own'd be my folly—yes (seduc'd my eye) I saw the golden mountains with a sigh; Saw with delight the fatal mischief shine, And envied ev'n the slave that dug the mine. How like the foolish insect My readers will quickly perceive that this allusion is not new, though differently applied. of the night, That leaves his cell, to seize the taper's light! Pleas'd and unconscious of the treach'rous rays, He hugs his fate, and dies amid the blaze. From thine, how diff'rent is my lot!—Alas! In calms of sunshine while thy moments pass, Mine, 'midst the murky clouds that life deform, Unequal rush, and mingle with the storm. Fir'd with the love of rhime, and, let me say, Of virtue too, I pour'd the moral lay; Much like Saint Paul (who solemnly protests He battled hard at Ephesus with beasts), I've fought with lions, monkeys, bulls, and bears, And got half Noah's ark about my ears: Nay worse! (which all the courts of justice know) Fought with the brutes of Paternoster-Row. THE MIDDLESEX ELECTION; OR, POETICAL EPISTLES, In the Devonshire Dialect, BY MR. JOSEPH BUDGE IN LONDON, TO LORD ROLLE, AT WEYMOUTH. Voakes talk a deal of Fox, Burdett, And Sheridan, and make me sweat, To hear their lees—I doubt mun— Zome cry mun up az thoff divine; And if they do in manners shine, I wish they'd carr't about mun.

And now, my lord, I've zot me down To write vrom theese perdigious town, Vill'd with more sin than grace; Learge az Jerusalem, I'm tould, Aye, or az Babylon of ould, Zo wonderzom the place. Ex'ter's a fool to't, let me zay, And zo is Plimmoth ev'ry day— The howzes high and big; And in the parlours, too, zo neat, Where all the gentry munch their met, I've never zeed a pig. In many of the farm-houses and villages, pigs and poultry are generally parlour-boarders. No, nor a hin Hen., making a rout, With chicken rennin in and out, Hunting about the room; Nor goose-checks, no, nor gabbling ducks, Flapping their wings all wet and mucks, And quaakin vor a crume. Things be quite diff'rent here, my lord, They be, they be, upon my word— Fine clath upon the vloors; Fine chairs, fine pectures 'pon the wall; Fine glasses in the sarvants'-hall, Brass locks upon the doors. O Lord, my lord, I'm in a maze, I do so look about and glaze, Just leek a stinking hare; And than the vokes!—Lord, what a heap! Thick as the meggots 'pon a sheep— I'm always in a fair. And than the ladies, zuch a rout, Walking and gigling zo about, All in their silks and lace; And though zo fine, they make me stap, Geeing my shoulder a small rap, And zmiling in my face. But meend, my lord, that I've be tould Thoose gentry may be bort and zold Leek bullocks or leek sheep; And thoff zo handzom, vor small pins, One now and then mert Might. buy their skins— How wonderzomly cheap! But now, my lord, vor gerter things, Vor now I'll screw my fiddle-strings, Forsooth, a leet Little. bit higher: The vokes nere thoft that Middlesex Would rear its head the curt to vex— But the fat is in the vire. And now, my lord, you may believe I shaant be laughin in my sleeve, And telling packs o'lees; And yet, zo zur az I can spy, From London people's mouths they fly In swarms, like swarms of bees. Therevore, whatever I shall write, No soul shall zay it is not right— They shaant zay no zich thing; And if I tell the truth, and zo, I'll gee ye leave, my lord, to show My letter to the king. Vor well I know that ev'ry day You've zomething clever to'n to zay, You be so wondrous frisky; Vor when at Ex'ter When his majesty did the city of Exeter the honour of a visit, Mr. Jan Rolle (afterwards his lordship) endeavoured to crack a few jokes in the royal presence, to display to the people his familiarity with crowned heads: one was most unsuccessful, as it carried stronger marks of impudence than wit; for, on introducing a country clergyman at the levee, ‘An please your medgesty,’ cried the 'squire, ‘Passon ?, a very good subject, and, leek your medgesty, hath made a howzevull o'cheldren.’, if you meend, You often teel'd un all an eend To place in a state of much expectation. To laugh leek any pisky. Well now, my lord, than to begin, The curt voke wodn't gee a pin T'ensure their man, Mainwaring; When (who'd a thort it?) A small oath. fath and soul, Out leap'd Sir Francis vrom his hole, And zot us all a staring. But never meend, we baant afeard; Vor, sir, az zur as I've a heard, We all shall ha our wish; Burdett wull zoon look dev'lish blue, And zo we shaant much meend the crew, No more than stinking vish. But still to make shor o'the game, The curt hunth out the blind and lame, And mainly stir their stumps; Zo that I think the game is shor, If Fortune is n't a d?d old wh?, As we have got the trumps. Burdett waant do, my lord, he waant; He can't succeed—he can't, he can't: He conquer us, the scab! He, that ne'er renn'd a race before; ‘Yes, you're a racer, to be sure,’ Cried the Devil to the crab. Mainwaring is a clever justice— In he, Lord, every body's trust is— Burdett's a ratten meddler; Volks shud tern round and zee their backs, And meend old proverbs—Little packs Become a little pedlar. He zaid he did not care a lowze About his setting in the Howze; But that, my lord's, a hum: Zee how he beggth and stirth his zell— A fellow must love bacon well, To kiss the old sow's b?m. Burdett shud cast accounts at Coote's— The counting-howze his genius soots, And there he may be saving; There he may sheen, and be a king; A handsaw is a useful thing, But never made for shaving. Mainwaring is a clever man, Doth ev'ry bit o'good he can, Az ev'ry one believes; Attendth the office very duly, Never takth bribes—behaving truly, And hangth a power o'thieves. And then a hath a power o'spies, To zee that no rebellion rise, And markth down all black sheep; And thoose he dooth suspect, he zens To Aris, to vill up his pens, And there in clover sleep. They've got the sheriffs, whose damn'd droat Approve their own poor ratten votes, While ours they dare deny-all; Cunning anew there—to secure ye, A fox should not be of the jury Upon a goose's trial. And should Sir Francis git the day, Lord! what will all the country zay? Why, that it gitt'th a rogue— Burdett and Middlesex agree! Agosh! a marriage it will be, Between a cat and dog. Look to the public howzes all: I've beed into mun gert and small, Drink'd beer from ev'ry tap; Mainwaring's health went always round, With zich a noble clattering sound, With zich a glorious clap! Think o'their impudence, his crew— They zet up zich a hallebulloo, Close by the palace doors! Just like a pack o'lyons roar'd, They did, the dogs—they did, my lord, The saucy sons of wh?. I wish that I'd a beed the king, I'd a made jobbernowls to ring, And cool'd mun var ther bras; The maids of honour should a got In ev'ry hand a chumber pot, And wash'd mun all leek shags. Vokes said it was a burnin shame, Disgrace, too, to the English name, To zet up zich a howl; The soldiers shud a help'd the crown, And shet mun just like sparrows down, And sent mun to the Dowl. Zome zay ther gang have sense and larnin: Why then, it is, to my disarnin, Good wine in filty flasks; Or, if you please, my lord, good beer, Zich as you brew in Devonsheer, Put into stinking casks. I'll do my best to make mun zick: I daant know that my oaken stick, Wull do much execution; But zich as 'tis, they're welcome to't, And with my oaken stick to boot, Good-will and resolution. Agosh! I long to try a bout With zom o'Burdett's rabble rout; I'd quickly pug their guts: I'd gee mun zich a lammin Violent. lick, I'd make mun of elections zick; I'd gee mun all the butts. If courage wull but win the day, By gosh, my lord, I'll nack away; I'll zoon be in their beef; Now if I could Sir Francis meet, All by his zelf, and in the street, Dam un I'd whap Beat. the thief. On e'er a one o'mun, agosh, A pack o'saucy trumpery trosh, That stiddy nort but treason— On zich rare fellows let me looze, Zoon as I'd kill a duck or gooze, I'd sliver ev'ry weasen. I'll answer I'd nack down my zell; Iss, to the ground, I'd waage, I'd fell, A dezzin to my share: When I'm put to't, Dowl take my skin! Life's not worth a grammar's pin— I'm mad az a march hare. And that Burdett may vend perchance: I think that we shall make un daunce, Or hugely I'm mistaken; Agosh! az I zee metters go, And perty well I simm to know, The rogues waant save their bacon. Mainwaring made a perty speech, As vur's my judgment well could reach; And what he cou'd, he dood; He made poor work o'Cold-bath howze— The trap that wishth to catch a mowze, Shud never smell of blood. My lord, I giss you wish to hear What vokes palaver here and there, All about 'Squire Pitt's disgrace: Ah, Lord! poor disappointed fellow, I daant believe he gitt'th zo mellow, Not zince he lost his place. I zeed'n in St. James's street: Close by his howze, we chanc'd to meet: ‘Ah! Budge,’ zaid he to me, ‘How doth Lord Rolle do, by the bye?—’ ‘Hearty's a farmer, sir,’ zaid I— ‘And how be you, sir—hæ?’ ‘Why, Budge,’ zaid he (but looking blue), ‘Thank God, that I be well enew, Considerin ev'ry thing:’ He zaid it too in zich a way, As plain as thoff I heard un zay, ‘Oh, Budge, I've lost the king.’ You know, my lord, when it wet weather You and me play'd at put together, The king would win the knave; The queen, you know, cou'd do zo too— Slam off a went, without more ado: Nort could his bacon save. But, Lord! in curts 'tis alter'd quite: Ev'n I, with my poor blinking sight, Zee quite a diff'rent thing— Vur there, agosh! 'tis not the same; For there they backwards play the game, And knaves can win a king. I speak not in 'Squire Pitt's despraise, Because you simm'd to leeke his ways, Though by zum vokes abhorr'd— You, to be shore, wan't let'n down, Who did so worry the poor crown To dub a gert lord. For hadn't it beed for Mister Pitt, I daant think we had got the wit To get the pretty feather. And let me zay t'ye, fath and soul, You still had been but poor 'Squire Rolle, Nether one thing nor tether— That is, my lord, nothing at all, Nor high, nor low, nor gert, nor small; In short, what vokes call fudge. And now, my lord, by the next post, I'll write if things be winn'd or lost— Your sarvant, Joseph Budge. LETTER II. CONTENTS TO LETTER II.

Sylvester and Maddox, and Mr. Mainwaring the worthy Candidate himself—Mr. Budge greatly hurt at the Exhibition of Irons, Whips, &amp;c. the insignia of his Excellency Governor Aris, of the Cold-bath-fields Goal, commonly called the Bastille—he wisheth this Bastille the Fate of his great Brother and Predecessor of France—Mr. Budge displeased at his Treatment by the Mob—The Aperture of Mr. Budge's loyal Mouth unfortunately filled with a Cabbage-stump—treated in a most ungentlemanly Manner—hustled—robbed—He reproveth the Mob—Mr. Budge's Conversation with one of the Mob, more consequential than edifying—Mr. Budge concludeth in a Strain of Exultation and Defiance, with less Sublimity than Isaiah on the Downfall of the King of Babylon, but with equal Rage and Abuse. Things go on zwimmingly, my lord: Dree hundred votes a head we've scor'd— Dree hundred! aye, and more. Had I ten thousand pounds, d'ye zee, I wuddn't one brass vardin gee, To make th' election shore. To help a lame dog, there's that Fox, And there's Lord William, with a p?x, And Sheridan the Devil— Aye, let mun go—but poor Burdett Wull vend to's cost, that zich a set Wull gee his corn the wevil. They ride to Brentford to harangue— Lord! how I lang to shet Shoot. the gang, They make me look dam zour; With gert good will vor theese black job, I'd take my wetch out o'my fob, And cuss mun by the hour. In coaches vull as they could stuff, Damn mun, off zot the blue and buff, Parading droo the Strand; Zich holding up of derty paws, Zich waving hats, and zich huzzas, Enough to stun the land! With mizzick, too, G?d d?n their bones, Crowds, horns, and organs, with their groans, Zich as we hear in charch; Now, had they ax'd me vor a tune, Well had Iss I. vitted mun, and zoon, I'd gid mun the Rogue's March. Amongst the derty, lowzy crew, There's zich a touse and hallibulloo, Enew to stun ould Nick; With zich a mob, too, to their tails, Peek'd, I suppose, vrom all the jails, Leek meggots all zo thick. Vokes talk a deal of Fox, Burdett, And Sheridan, and make us sweat To hear their lees Lies.—I doubt mun— Zome cry mun up as thoff divine; And if they do in manners shine, I wish they'd carr't about, mun. Peepel should practise what they know; Or where's the use of it, I trow? No, no, I'm not the fool To think that they have much to spare; Vor he that goeth vor manners there, Goeth to a goat vor wooll. The women, too, the bissy jades! Zome o'mun gentlevokes, zome trades, Push vore their polls from windors, And toss their hankitchers about: I wish I had the rabble rout One minute in my grinders. I'd gee the devils zich a squeeze, I'd make mun look zo small as meeze Mice., Well chow'd by our ould cat. Iss, iss, I'd gee mun zich a grip, I'd bang mun well, had I a whip, I'll warrant mun vor that. Iss, iss, I'd make the madams squall, I'd lerrick Beat. mun—iss, one and all— I'd pent their pretty skins. What bissens Business. have they to rant and stare, And hoist their nackens Handkerchiefs. in the air, And show their nasty grins? What bissens ha wimmen wey election, That should be always in subjection, And know we be their lords? Zwunds, let mun meend their howze and stitching, And net be vor election itching— We want none o'their words. Their bissens is to wash and mend, And car and vetch, and husbands tend, Make puddins, pies, and tarts; Zee that their maidens meend their broom, To zweep the spiders, cleanse the room, And wash the shefts and sharts. The ditchesses be mainly blamed; Vokes zay they mert be all asham'd To trollop with the men. My lord, vor sartinty I know Thoose ditchesses must never show The nose at curt agen. If well they wud their zels demean, Let mun take pattern from the ?, That jewel o'a oman; Zo good, zo generous to the nation; Zo kind to ev'ry poor relation; A thing zo main uncommon. In Windsor when there was zich bustle About a member, zich a tussel, Did she go round to vokes, And zay, ‘If you daant vote for Powny, Meend, not a vurdin of my money Shall go to you vor smocks?’ Did she run round her zell, and maids, To shopkeepers and wother trades, And moil and make a fuss? Zay to the mercer, ‘Maister Inkle,’ And to the vishman, ‘Maister Wrinkle, ‘You geef your vote for us. ‘We be great peeples, Maister Inkle; We be rish peeples, Maister Wrinkle, And haf a goote long puss; And dan we haf grete pow'r, mine Gote! Now dink 'pon diss, and give your vote, Vid out more vords, vor us.’ Or did vokes hear zich zounds az thoose, ‘Must vote, must vote, mustn't refuse: No, no—hæ, hæ—no, no, Won't buy—won't buy a broom or mop— Hæ, hæ, won't recommend your shop— My borough—must, must be so. ‘My borough this, hæ, hæ, Tape, Tape, Shan't come and buy my coat a cape, Shan't purchase at your shop— Must vote for Powny—must, must vote, Or mind I never buy a coat, No, no, man—not one slop.’ My lord, you tould me in your laast, You wish'd to know 'bout all that past. My lord now you shall hear: A fellow, but we daant know who, Belonging to the wother crew, Com'd vore, and talk'd dam queer; Com'd vore the hustins ev'ry day, And leek a lawyer talk'd away, In a lawyer's wig and gown; Made our poor counsel cursed zick, Tich'd Counsellor Maddox to the quick, And nack'd Sylvester down. Zay'd to Mainwaring zich hard things, Zwear'd that he was a tool o'kings, And kiss'd the tail o'Pitt; That az vor glory, or disgrace, Az long as he could hold his place, He did not care a nit. That az vor Englishmen he thort, 'Twas best their commons should be short, A gang of saucy knaves; That geeves and whips, and little met, Wud manners (what they wanted) get, Full good enew vor slaves.’ The varmint Vermin. had got wit at will, And gid the lawyers zich a pill, Though a wasn't worth a shilling; I must zay this, I vow to G?d, A was zo comical a toad, He zot us all a grilling. Maddox stood buff, and stood it out, Though soundly pull'd, fath, by the snout He veel'd zom ugly blows: But poor Sylvester, he poor soul, Just leek a mowze, sneak'd to his hole, And never show'd his nose. I wish your lordship had be there, To zee the saucy dog, and hear Zome lees, and zome things true; His wit was leek a two-edged sword, And I do really think, my lord, He was a match vor you. My lord, it nearly tern'd my brains, To zee the vetters, whips, and chains, They carr'd about the town; Sound of Bastille mak'th menny quiver, And petrifieth their very liver— I wish the place was down. Vor why?—becaze 'tis zich a name, I shud not grieve to zeet in flame. I'm cruelly afeer'd The chains wull do the cause no good: They push'd mun nearly as they coud Up to Mainwaring's beard. My lord, I daant leek Lendon ways: Vor hap'ning 'mongst the mob to praise Mainwaring—zounds, at once, One scoundrel gid my tail a kick, Anether, with a slammin stick, Com'd souse upon my sconce. 'Tis true my pate was roundly maul'd: I open'd than my mouth and bawl'd Mainwaring and his cause; Bevore I clos'd my mouth again, A rascal ramm'd, with mert and main, A colestump in my jaws. And than they hustled me about, Drode me along, the rabble rout, And what was worse—odd chuck it! Zoon as I got up vrom the ground, Where I lied sprawling, Lord! I vound The dogs had peek'd my pucket. My puckethankitcher and gloves I neatly lost between their shoves— Confound mun with a p?x! A corkscrew and a penny bun, And, ah! the worst of all the fun, My poor old backy-box. ‘You ought to be asham'd,’ zaid I, To one o'mun that stude close by, ‘To sarve one zich a trick. ‘Wud Ex'ter vokes ha sarv'd one zo?’ Quoth I to'n—‘no, they wud'n—no— They'd zooner zee Old Nick.’ Zo then they laugh'd—'pon which, quoth I, ‘I'll tell my lord of this by'n by, And zend ye all to jail.’ Quoth one, and winking with his eye, ‘What lord dost mean?’—‘Lord Rolle,’ zaid I; ‘He'll make ye drap your tail.’ ‘Lord Rolle,’ quoth he, ‘may come and kiss ‘My’—‘what?’ quoth I.—Quoth he, ‘Why this,’ And then he tack'd his rump. Zaid I, ‘I'll tel'n o't, be ashor'd; Dam me if I daant tell my lord, And he shall make thee jump.’ Zo zays the rogue, ‘With all my soul, And give my sarvice to Lord Rolle— I've heerd a deal about'n.’ Zaid I, ‘No harm, ye dog, dost zee.’ ‘No, nor no good, by G?d,’ zaid he. Lord! how I lang'd to clout'n! But let mun bluster it away, Let the poor jackasses all bray, Their bacon waant be saa'd; Their poverty is plain anew, The devils wull zoon ha all the crew: Bald pates be quickly shav'd. Stap, stap a leet, and we shall zee Who will the lords and measters be— They'll ha no cause to laugh; There wull be bellowing enow, Egosh! exactly leek a cow, Just parted vrom her calf. POSSKREP. WULL ye be pleas'd, my lord, to go, Jest run to G? L?, or zo, You know 'tis but a stap; And ax the sarvants, they can tell, If any old cloaths they've got to zel, Becaze I've got a chap. Or candle-eends, or some zich thing, Belonging to the ? or ?, Wud vet a perty penny. Pray trat away, and ax my lord, And be zo kind to zend me word, My lord, if there be enny. I'm told old gowns, zome good, zome bad, And cheap too, may zometimes be had, Smocks, hankitchers, and shoes; And wother sorts of ladies geer, Little the worse, I'm told, vor wear, That vokes may peek and chuse. Pray go, and try your hand, my lord: Ax lady ?, and zend me word, Vor all I zay is true; I want zome finery for my dame; Zo that, my lord, I'll do the same Vor Lady Rolle and you. And could I get a king's old wig, Lord! I shud look zo fine and big, The parish wud zo stare! And, as the man's upon the spot, Ax Curnel Gwyn if he hath got Zome babby-cloaths to spare. I think I have no more to zay, But that my dame and I both pray Vor yours and madam's soul; And hopes (if we may crack a joke) That Ex'ter and the Devonshire voke May never want a Roll. LETTER III. CONTENTS TO LETTER III. Mister Budge seemeth in a most terrible Funk about the Election—prognosticateth woefully—Mister Budge talketh mercifully of his Excellency Governor Aris—repeateth a short and pithy Speech of the Mob to the Soldiers that guarded Governor Aris's Castle, also the loyal and brave Reply of the Soldiers to the Mob, proving themselves to be a Sort of State-machines—Mr. Budge painteth the Abhorrence of the People to Governor Aris's Dwelling and Jail, and his Mode of Treating his Prisoners—Mr. Budge very impartially summeth up the Matter, and subscribeth to the Punishment of Governor Aris, provided his Guilt can be fully established—the same Impartiality likewise in respect to Mr. Pitt, the great Friend and Patron of Governor Aris—Mister Budge breaketh out into Strains of Pity—Mister Budge most naturally professeth a Scepticism, that is to say, doubts, concerning the Cruelty of Governor Aris—Mister Budge most heroically supporteth Mister Mainwaring, and, with his poetical Cat-'o-nine-tails, belaboureth the Backs of his Calumniators—he triumpheth in his own Discernment, and becometh positively vain-glorious—Mister Budge descanteth sensibly on the Fallibility of Rumour, and the sad Consequence of believing every idle Report—bringing in Kings and Bishops, and the Lord knows who—Mister Budge talketh of Scandal—not even the most virtuous, the most meek, the most humble, the most œconomical Lady of the Land, free from the Aspersions of Scandal—Mister Budge counselleth Sir Francis, and concludeth most epigrammatically. O Lord! my lord! Lord, what d'ye think? Our cause, I fear, beginn'th to stink, But God Allmerty knows; 'Tis thort by menny that Burdett Will gee the justice a d?mn'd sweat, And zend'n to the crows. Zome zay Burdett wull git the field— The mob vor'n all be mad and weeld, They doat upon'n zo; Because he mounth the stage, and rails, Forsooth, against bastilles and jails, And wanth to lye mun low: And nack up Aris, if they can, Zome zay a very honest man, That keep'th a sharp look out; That watch'th his pris'ners leek a hawk, And dothn't care a fig vor voke— All very right, no doubt. 'Tis zaid his gaolbirds all complain, And daant admire his whip and chain, Nor hole as black as soot; But Aris swearth they may be damn'd, Into the hole they shall be ramm'd, If he think'th rert to do't. Mob wanth to tear un all to rags, And pent ‘No bastille’ 'pon their flags, And just leek tigers growl; And want to gee the jailbird dogs The vlesh of cows, and calves, and hogs, And dainty vish and vowl. And than they to the zoldiers zaid, ‘O ye gert fools!—O! what a head, To guard theese place—vor who? Why if ye dare speak out your meend, In a veew minutes ye wull vend, The place was bilt for you.’ But ‘'twudn't do:’ the zoldiers zed, ‘That by their trade they got their bread, And liv'd upon the land.’ And than they answer'd very well, ‘That if they were zent off vor Hell, They must obey command.’ And yet the people cuss bastille; Zomthing about that place they veel, That gall'th and mak'th mun shiver; In short, my lord, they hate the name, And wish it, vrom their souls, in flame, And damn the poor man's liver. Aris, the governor they call'n, Their itching vingers itch to maul'n, They zay he is zo cruel; Stuff'th pris'ners in a vile old hole, Cramm'th men together, cheek by jowl, And geeth mun water-gruel: Flogg'th mun az t'were zo menny dogs, Call'th mun zich names, az though t'were hogs; And this he doth vor sport. Now this is what the people zay; It maant be true, and yet it may: Then let the knave be cort. Than let un veel what wothers veel, In theese most horrible bastille, And drink as wothers drink; And eat the trade that wothers eat, And sweat in holes as wothers sweat, And stink as wothers stink. If Aris be that cruel dog, E'en let'n suffer vor a rogue, A potcrook let'n veel: I'd gee'n of whip his belly vull, I'd make un bellow leek a bull, And sken un leek an eel. And if 'Squire Pitt upholdth us in it, I'd run and tear away, theese minute, His howze about his ears: I grieve to think on the poor souls That groan amidst their dirty holes, And wash mun with their tears. But I daant take it in my head To credit ev'ry thing that's zed— No, no, all is not Gospel; People tell hummers ev'ry hour, Vor which, if I had got the pow'r, I'd cool mun in a hoss pool. Maister Mainwaring's much abuz'd, Most greeviously for things accus'd, By all the dowlish pack; E'en let mun all their poison spit, My lord, there is no wooll zo whit, That a dyer caan't make black. They try to make the world believe, He glorieth in a whip and geeve, And things that can torment; And when that Aris is attack'd, He's always by Mainwaring back'd, And so scap'th punishment. I know who's who, and what vokes be; I haan't yet lost the pow'r to zee, No more than that o' veeling; I never make a gooze a swan— A thief may be a gentleman That git'th estates by stealing. I can distinguish straw vrom hay, Can tell a cuckoo from a jay, A peacock vrom a starling; Dogs vrom a pig that's in the looze, A Christian vrom a pack o' Jews, A yaffer Heifer. vrom a yarling. I baan't so maz'd to put belief In ev'ry dirty, lying thief— It mak'th my hair to bristle. Zom peeple gee themselves gert airs, Zay ev'ry thing bezides their pray'rs, And thoose, agosh! they whistle. If one believ'd in ev'ry thing, God bless his majesty, the ?, He'd look a little blue; If zich be martyrs to a hum, Lord! then, my lord, what wud become Of zich as me and you? And than how wud our bishops stand, And half the parsons of the land? Scandal's a fine keen blade; He meet'th with zomething ev'ry day, And mainly cutt'th and hack'th away, And simm'th to know his trade. That vartuous lady, our good ?, Zo humble, and so neat and clean, Caan't even 'scape the mucks; The world wull always zomething zay, To take a body's name away— Oddrat their lying chucks! But zee! with all their leeing art, They dare not vall upon her heart, But vall upon her nose; About her handkitchers and stuff, And aprons vull of dirty snuff, And how her nose she blows. And than they talk of poor relations, And tell zich lees, Lord! nations, nations, O Lord! iss—lees galore In abundance.— Lees that a body almost veels, Making one's hair stand up leek queels Upon a hadgy-bore. Let Burdett meend his countin-howze, And know his zelf to be a mowze, Or zoon he'll be a ballet; Let'n be humble, zuck his paws— A disell Thistle., by an ass's jaws, Is thoft a pretty sallet. Charles Fox and he may notes compare; What one wull zay the tether'l zware, And zo they stand haranguing; And try to blend us all, d'ye zee; Iss, iss, leek bells they all agree, Want nothing now but hanging. LETTER IV. CONTENTS TO LETTER IV. Great Doubts and discouraging Presentiment in the Mind of Mister Budge, who seemeth not to like the Posture of Affairs—he is hurt and offended at a Kind of Triumph among some of Sir Francis's Party—Mister Budge comforteth himself with Similes drawn from Cock-fighting and Hunting—Mister Budge meeteth his Lordship's good Friend Pitt, of whom he giveth a most melancholy Account—No Nod from the ?, no Curtsy from the ?, and the Avenues of St. James's shut—Mister Pitt not in total Despondence—Mister Budge seeth Mister Pitt in a broad Stare on St. James's Clock, and St. James's Palace—Mister Budge's deep Reflections on the Mutability of Fortune, with a beautiful and original Comparison—Mister Budge more than suspecteth Mister Pitt's boasted Patriotism and Disinterestedness, from the Circumstance of oppressing the Nation with Pensions for his Tools, and Wives and Mothers of his Tools, at the Time of his Dismissal—Mister Budge exhibiteth a splendid Account of Mister Pitt's Table—he concludeth wittily. My lord, I daant leek things to-day: Things look dam quare, as I may zay; Zomething is in the wind— Zome ambuscade—zome mine, I fear, To whisk us all into the air, Az var az I can vind. Odswinge! my lord, we weer long jaws, We simm to hold out tiger claws, Without the pow'r of pinching, Our foes, the refugees of jails, I'm much afeard, wull clip our nails: Our corps, my lord, simm'th flinching. The dowl the dirty rogues confound! They simm more bould—simm gettin ground; Zich impudence they show! ‘We be cock-sure,’ the knaves all zay— ‘Iss, iss, cock-sure to git the day;’ And zo they peertly crow. But let mun crow and flap their wings, We must not simm to meend thoose things— Battles baant got by crowing; Foxes and hares baant catch'd by noise, By huntin-horns, and yowlin boys, By hollowing and blowing. Zo let us put our trust in God, And hope that he hath got a rod, A handsome one, in pickle; To warm their pretty little sides; To please their nice and tender hides, And gee a pretty tickle. My lord, I've zeed 'Squire Pitt again; He shak'd his head, and simm'd in pain, 'Bout Mainwaring's election; He shrink'th his shulders, wish'th un well; But vur az I can zee and tell, Can't gee un much protection. Vor Pitt his zell, I vend, my lord, Caan't git vrom one gert man a word, You know who 'tis I mean— No, nor a syllable, I'm tould, No, truly, not for love nor gold, Vrom his old friend the q?. Agosh! Saint James's doors be barr'd, And that, you'll zay, is cruel hard: But Pitt is still in hopes; Stoutly resolv'th to risk his all, To storm the fortress—mount the wall By ladders or by ropes. I zee un both by day and night: A look'th a mallancholy sprite; Zo zad, zo woe-begone! He had most damnably been dish'd, And zo must look confounded wish'd, When all is zaid and done. Zome days I zee un go an airing, And in the streat I've zeed un staring Against Saint James's clock; And when the yard I zee un spy, ‘Ah, Lord! zome people's tails,’ zaid I, ‘Have had a dowlish dock.’ He, that was once so gert, thoft I, That cock'd his nose zo mainly high, Zo gert in all the shows Levees and drawing-rooms.; And now chopvallin, tern'd out o' place; Among the gold and silver lace, A daan't put in his nose. But to my zell I zaid agen, ‘It is the common case of men— Now up aloft, now down; Leek boys and girls a laughing rout, In flying coaches tern'd about, In fair and market-town.’ And yet, my lord, I cannot zay Pitt travell'd with clean hands away; Vor when at last he vound That all his cunning wudn't do, And that a must be forc'd to go, And coudn't keep his ground: What did a do?—Why bad enough— All that his tribe could carry off, Ecod, away they carr'd it— Lord Grenville and his mumping wife, The Lord knows what they did for life— Most lovingly they shar'd it. Agosh, my lord, 'twas leek the French: When they be kick'd out o' the trench, And forc'd, the dogs, to run; They catch up ev'ry thing they ken, Daan't leave a duck, nor cock, nor hen— All goeth az shore's a gun. Zo that the conqu'rors, when they cum, Caan't vend a drap o' gin nor rum, No, nor a rend o' cheese; All that they leave behend, agosh, Is nort but mucks, and rags, and trosh, Bezides the rats and meeze. And then one Canning, a poor boy, Took from a school to his employ, Once thoft a huge deep thinker— He, like a very duteous son, Got nice tid bits for Mother Hun, And brother Tom the tinker; And zister Peg, and zister Joan, With scarce a flannel dicky on, As vur as I can learn; Broken-down actresses, they zay, That in the country us'd to play For herrings in a barn. Now though this curious young man got A hundred thousand with Miss Scott, (Egad? a fortune thumping) Behold! a hadn't got the heart To give his family a peart, Zo zent mun out a mumping. I caan't zay that I leeke the plan, That ev'ry lab'ring sarvin man Shud sweat to nurse their prides: But zome (or there be lying tongues) Can very coolly cut large thongs Vrom other people's hides. My lord, zince Mister Pitt's disgrace, I often knack in at Park Place, (A liv'th at number vive); And there I talk with Will and Tom, About things past, and things to come, And zee'fth they be alive. Vor though they zay the man is poor, I zee no signs of that, I'm sure; There's meet for man and mowze. But where he get'th it I can't tell, But fath I leeke his kitchen's smell— He keepth a roaring howze. Sarvants in lace zo fine and big, And ev'ry one as fat's a pig— And why?—vor ev'ry minute Out com'th a bottle and a jug, In com'th a choice and foaming mug, And ev'ry nose was in it. While he, poor man! I'm bould to think, Hath nearly now drink'd up his drink, He may thank his own self vort't; If any body might suppose, And take a guiss from his red nose, His veins all run with port. You know, my lord, that people zay, How ev'ry dog hath got his day— Now Mister Pitt's was fine; And you've had yours, leek all gert men: And now, my lord, I wonder when That I shall look 'pon mine. POSTKREP. I've just knack'd in at Mister Pitt's— The sarvants half out o' their wits, Zich running in and out! Poor man, he mak'th most cruel groans— Sir Walter try'th to ease his bones, And call'th it flying gout. I daan't know what a mean'th by flying I think the gentleman is dying, Now that's my sense of things: A flying gout—well! zo it may— And zoon I think will fly away With Pitt upon his wings. Excuse the liberties I take And observations that I make— God know'th, I'm no great judge. Having no more to zay or write, I wish your lordship a good night, And rest your sarvant, Budge. LETTER V. CONTENTS TO LETTER V. A wonderful and unexpected peripetia in the Election Drama, by the Means of the Millers in Ambuscade—Mister Budge seemeth full of Lamentation—his Friends put on sad Faces—comforteth himself with the hopes of future Success—Mister Budge desponds—wisheth to have a pitched Battle with some of Burdett's Party; but, on Recollection, deemeth it not prudent to exhibit his Prowess, giving an Irish Reason, rather unfavourable to the heroic Character of Lord Rolle and himself—Mister Budge disliketh the Triumphs of Sir Francis, and also the honourable Circumstance of being drawn in his Coach by the Mobility—he entertaineth Hopes from the Virtue of a select Committee—Mister Budge telleth a very good Story of Farmer Tab, which seemeth to be known by many People out of Trade as well as in Trade—Farmer Tab's Story endeth, and Mister Budge concludeth. Good Gosh! my lord, prepare to hear Zomething that waant much please, I vear; A two-and-forty pounder! Zounds! we have nort but loosing tacks; We now be humbled 'pon our backs— Lord! Lord! as vlat's a vlounder! When all simm'd quiet, neat and snug, Safe as a vlea within his rug, Afear'd of no vlea-killers— Up vrom their ambush where they lied, And rushing like a main spring tide, Up leap'd a pack of millers! To tell your lordship of our looks, It is not in the pow'r of books! Now, what then shall I say? Why, fath we look'd as whit as witches, At all those dourty sons of b??ches— 'Twas horror and dismay. Sir Francis laugh'd—Mainwaring star'd, And thoff a justice, curs'd and swear'd, And zed it could not be? And all Mainwaring's friends about, They kick'd and made the damdest rout, Zo down in the mouth was he. 'Twas sartingly a cunning trick, And zo our cock hath had a nick; Iss, iss, we've lost the main— His droat is cut, and there he lieth; He must give up the ghost—he dieth, He'll ne'er get up again. It is in vain to curse and zwear; Az Frenchmen zay—‘fortin a guere’— 'Tis nonsense to be subbing; And though they now have got the battle, Hereafter we may meet the cattle, And gee the dogs a drubbing. My lord, I lang'd to try a bout With zum o' Burdett's rabble rout— I'd zoon a pugg'd their guts; And gid mun menny a lammin lick, And made mun of elections zick; I'd gid mun all the butts. And it, 'tis best as 'tis, perhaps; We mert a catch'd zom arterclaps, And be well drash'd for sterrin; Iss, iss, I mert a goad to pot, And got less credit than we got In Ireland by the berrin. You meend, my lord, the famous day, When vrom the corpse we runn'd away, Afear'd the French wud skin us; Dreaving nor looking once behind, Coosing leeke greyhounds and the wind, As though the devil was in us. Well, now again for th' old affair— We be zo mad az we can stare, Leek curs we drap our tails; While Burdett's rogues in triumph run, And whoop, and hollow—make zich fun— Zo proud they hoist their sails. And leek gert fools, the rabble rout Took from the coach the hosses out, To drag Burdett along— Had I beed coachman, I'd a drash'd mun Leek jackasses, I'd zo a lash'd mun, And wear'd out many a thong. The mob waan't leave bevore they're hang'd, They want most hugely to be bang'd, They caan't leave their vagaries; Near Cold-bath-fields they lerk about, To try to get the jailbirds out, And stay alive poor Aris. We talk of scrutinies, my lord; The curt th' expenses wull aford, And zom vokes in the city: We yet may zend mun all to hell, If we contrive to manidge well, And chuse a good committee. I'm tould, and I believe 'tis true, There is not in Burdett's whole crew Dree honest men among mun; Though carrin, negers, mangy curs, Oh! how I lang to comb their furs! Oh, d?n it! how I'd thong mun! They shud ha zom veow honest men, At least 'bout one or two in ten; But, zounds! they've none at all— And if we sarch the crew all round, Lord, Lord! what iz there to be vound, Examine gert and small? With your good leave, I'll zet bevore ye, My lord, a midget of a story Of Farmer Tab, my neighbour— Zays Farmer Tab, one day, to me, ‘When I begun the world,’ zays he, ‘I was oblig'd to labour.’ And zo zays Farmer Tab, zays he, ‘I thort that I wud honest be, And never wrong a soul— Ah! Lord, I quickly went to pot— Iss, by my honesty zoon got Into a dirty hole. ‘Now, what shall I do now? quoth I— A bit o' roguery let me try— And zo I tern'd a rogue; And got a mint o' money zoon, Could lie abed, agosh, till noon— A charming lazy dog. ‘But, Lord, Lord, Lord, it was not long, Poor bird, bevore I chang'd my zong; God! I was forc'd to tridge Vor writing 'pon a piece o' paper: I really thort that I shud caper, When brought bevore the jidge. ‘But by God's marcy, and a bribe, Deliver'd to a sartin tribe, I sav'd my neck a rope. Well, what, quoth I, shall I do now? What method take to speed the plough? Ah! Lord, I'm out o' hope. ‘Not honesty nor roguery do, Says I, Lord, looking wondrous blue— And then I scratch'd my pate; And fath, scratch'd in a pretty thought, That grist to mill abundance brought, And made a good estate. ‘And zo upon a scheme I fix'd: Roguery and honesty well mix'd May do, says I, the feat; And zo at once to work I went, And mix'd mun to my heart's content, Half honesty, half cheat. ‘And now, thank God, I turn a penny, Live creditable too as enny, By mixin mun together— By this, Jo, thee and thy old wife May laugh at all the storms of life, And ha good sunsheen weather.’ Zo end'th the tale of Farmer Tab: But Burdett and his crew, the scab, Treat honesty az nort— And thoff they've prosper'd theeze one time, I hope that vor zom other crime crime The devils wull all be cort. LETTER VI. CONTENTS TO LETTER VI. Mister Budge having finished his History of the Middlesex Election giveth a History of his Visit at Mr. Pitt's House, in Park Place; where a very curious Conversation taketh place between Mister Budge and the Servants, that showeth what wonderful Liberties Servants take with their Masters, behind their Backs. You bid me go, my lord, and quare Vor Mister Pitt—zo I went there And nack'd—and zo stapp'd in; Zays I, ‘My lord hath zent to know, How Mr. Pitt doth do, and zo.’— Zo Thomas strok'd his chin; And hemm'd and ha'ad—at last, says he ‘Look, Joe—I'll tell thee what—dost zee— Our measter is dam bad— A drink'th too hard—muddleth his head, And not till your a goeth to bed, That mak'th me cursed mad. ‘Measter's a toper ev'ry inch: Egod, I never know'dn flinch, Iss, measter wull die game; He'll never run, I'll answer vor't; He waan't forsake the good old port, And quinch his nose's flame. ‘And zo what signifieth the pills, And trade, that a large basket vills, That Doctor Farq'har zends? Lord, Lord! why ev'ry sarvant laughs, To zee the bolusses and draffs, While measter never mends. ‘Ere long he'll zing another tune— I think we shall ha mourning zoon, Death wull be vor'n too cunning. We have rare times o't, to be shore— No key upon the cellar door, The cock for ever running.’ ‘Thomas,’ quoth I, ‘I hugely itch, To know if measter Pitt be rich, Hæ, Thomas—lean or fat: By many peepel I've be told, That was a to be bought and sold, A isn't worth a graat.’ ‘Zo many peepel za,’ quoth Tom; ‘But trust me, Joe, 'tis all a hum, A trap to take in ninnies; Pretending to be cruel poor, But az we zay here, that's a bore, Our measter roll'th in guineas. ‘Yes, mun, he shams, and foams, and frets, Pretendin a caan't pay his debts, To prove to all the nation, He doth not take their goods away, Stidding their int'rest ev'ry day, And bring about salvation. ‘I, I,’ quoth Thomas with a wink, ‘I fear my measter's name will stink, Like carrion, vore 'tis long: Vokes make about'n now no rout— They all begin to ven'n out, And freely gee their tongue. ‘Meend me,’ quoth Tom, ‘the man I know— To Walmer Castle zoon he'll go, And simm zo poor, good Lord! Pertendin there was nothing sterrin: Zo make a dinner 'pon a herrin, Upon an old deal board. ‘He'll git a box of wood or tin, To put his zalt and pepper in, And munch his meal at noon, Without a rag o' table clath; And now shall ha a dish o' brath, And use a wooden spoon; ‘Make meals on barley bread and tates, 'Pon trenchers too, instead o' plates; Drink nort but dead small beer; And that too from a penny jug, Not able to avoard a mug, Poor man—no, that too dear. ‘Old Chatham did the very same, To git a little crumb o' name, The damnest eat-all glutton. He too could live, forsooth, 'pon leet; Could feast upon an ounce of meat, And peck a bone o' mutton. ‘But when old Pynsant, the mad fool (Beginning, I suppose, to drule), Play'd zich a mazeg'rry trick, And gidd'n all his fine estate; God help the poor old fellow's pate! 'Twas comfortably thick. ‘How quickly chang'd old measter's pallet! Down his long droat, Lord, zich a wallet, He stuff'd of vlesh and vish; Vensun and terbot—ev'ry thing, Fit to be put bevore the king, With ev'ry dainty dish. ‘Zich slaying, Lord! vrom morn to night! The cocks and hens in zich a fright! 'Twas all devour, devour! The pigs and poultry, ducks and geese, And terkies worth a crown a-piece, Cried “murder” ev'ry hour. ‘Loads tumbled in of ev'ry kind: Cook laugh'd, and nearly burst her wind— The sarvants all stood grinnin; 'Twas roast, and boil, and fry away, The spits were ternin all the day, And all the jacks were spinnin. ‘Iss, iss, old Chatham dood the same, That made the kingdom cry out shame, Aye, over, mun, and over; And measter's one of the old brood, The heart and soul, the bones and blood, As vur's I can discover. ‘He trieth to zee the king, I zay, Drowing his zelf zo in his way, To ketch a wink or nod— But, ah! that hacky mun waan't smoke: The k? waan't take agen his yoke, No, no, a waan't, by G?d.’ ‘The ? was hamper'd long anew, And now bidd'th leading strings adieu— Iss, bidd'th mun go to H?ll. Now this geeth all the world delight: The gentleman is in the right, Agosh! to please his zell. ‘Thou zeest, Joe, that I speak my mind; And trust me, zoon the world will vind Our measter's virtue fudge— 'Tis true, Joe, ev'ry bit, I'll swear, As true, Joe, as that thee stand'st here, Az true's thy name is Budge. ‘One may zee daylight—iss, iss, faith, Droo a small hole, the proverb zaith; I neither make nor mend. O Lord, I daan't tell all I know; But mum, I'm dumb, I'm dumb, and zo? Cats wink that be not blend. ‘Zome friends call now and then to zee'n, And little crumes o' comfort gee'n, And tell'n about the k?; Then with a stare he shak'th his head, Az much az though his mouth had zed, Ah, Lord! 'tis no zich thing.’ ‘Now Tom,’ quoth I, ‘about reform— Thee mendest the gert and merty storm, Bevore he got in place.’ ‘Aye, aye,’ zay'd Tom, ‘I meend the day, When measter starm'd and fum'd away, And put up his long face. ‘I heer'd un often with his gang, Aboo stairs 'pon th' affair harrang, And joking with the duke; Yes, fath, I heard their conversation; To think how nice the gudgeon nation Got hang'd upon their hook! ‘But, Joe, th' Old Bailey was the worst, Where measter gin'st his will was forc'd To gee his davy in; The curt at once leek'd bullocks star'd, His friends that follow'd'n were scar'd, His enemies 'pon the grin. ‘The jidge, his friend, that wish'd un well, Wish'd he would recollect his zell, Ecod, he was near cort! Zo measter hemm'd, and stettering zaid, He thort his mem'ry was decay'd, And cruel, cruel short. ‘And zo the jidges said they thort— And then a wink went round the curt; And Sheridan, the thief, Who never spar'th a man an inch— Gid'n a dam confounded pinch, Agosh! was in his beef. ‘Joe, thee'st a zeed a paper keet Heigh mounted, tackle all complete, When, Lord, the string break'th, snap— Than how a wheelth! now high—now zunk; Dipp'th here and there, leek a man drunk, When down a tumbleth zwap. ‘Agosh! zo our poor measter vall'd. Most cussedly the man was maul'd; Iss, iss, a zing'd dam smaall. 'Twas lucky too—vor, had the jidge Own'd a spite, or bit o' gridge, T'had been a harder vaall. ‘But all's blow'd over now, friend Joe; Thee know'st that happen'd long ago— 'Tis now become a joke. But there, Joe, as vor thee and I, We mustn't speak our meends—vor why? We must'n tich gert voke. ‘Measter's a greandenstone—zo rough, He is not complaisant enough, Not civil to the crown. And than remember the poor prince: Lord! how my measter mad'en wince! Zwinge! how a let'n down! ‘He did behave t'un cruel hard; And now he meet'th with his reward— It is too late to flatter. His royal highness waan't forgee't: He lov'th un, fath, I plainly zeet't, As the Dowl lov'th holy water. ‘Holwood wull by and by be zold, To make a view good bits o' gold; Zo he mak'th wise and frets. But meend, my maister dothn't want wit; 'Ere long he wull contrive to git Zome fool to pay his debts. ‘He caan't come in agen, vokes zay— Too menny bars be in his way: Bezides—the people hate'n; And could they git'n in their claws, Ecod, they'd pound his lantern jaws, And leek a bull they'd bait'n! ‘Canning the school-boy lurk'd in here, And zaftly whisper'd in his ear, He'd git'n from disgrace; He'd quickly tak'n by the poll, And lug'n vrom his dirty hole, And mak'n show his face. ‘He zaid he had be'd sly about, To veel the marchants pulses out, And for subscription caall; Vor a brass image vor the town, To which the people must bow down, And worship leeke old Baal. ‘But this was laughing in his sleeve— Contriv'd to make the king believe, That when he turn'd out Pitt, Off went the wisdom o' the court— All that remain'd was good vor nort, It wudn't sarve a nit. ‘The marchants, thoose that deal'd in loans, That fatten'd up their skins and bones, All runn'd into the trap; ‘An image, image,’ was the cry— Od dam the blockheads then! thought I— What! gull'd by zich a chap! ‘That zich a boy shud take mun in! Lord! ev'ry mouth was on the grin, Dree pearts of theese gert town. ‘Iss, put the image up,’ vokes zay, ‘Iss, put'n—and that very day We'll try to put'n down.’ ‘And zo they wull, except vokes race To Newgate vor a strong safe place, Or inside Bedlam walls; Or if the world must zee his phiz, The image must be made to quiz, Aloft upon Saint Paul's. ‘Zo much vor images, friend Joe, But thee and I baan't blend, dost know— I giss we know what's what. Well, Joe, as I were zaying, hæ, Az no more hopes of courts I zee, I'm looking vor my hat. ‘I've made zome hundreds in my place: But az my maister's in disgrace, What must a body do? Thou zeest I speak my meend out, Joe; And as the maister's on the go, The sarvant shud go too.’ Now zich was our discoose, my lord— I daan't know that I've miss'd a word, No, not a single thing; And if you shud think fit, or zo, Your lordship, if you please, may show My letter to the king. POSTKREP. MY lord, bevore I wrote theese letter, I heeard the sarvants grin and chetter, About a thing in hand; 'Tis caal'd a statue for 'Squire Pitt, To honour'n vor his pow'rs o' wit, And sense that sav'd the land. They do zo laugh, and make zich jeers, And d?mn mun, zo torment my ears, And mock'n zo in print: The cheeldish fools shud wear a bib— And zee, my lord, a louzy squib; I'm sure you'll zee nort in't. THE STATUE. ‘EACH good-natur'd cit Votes a statue to Pitt, For actions enormously evil; 'Tis suppos'd very soon, At the full of the moon, They will order a bust to the Devil.’ O Lord! O Lord! I'm pleas'd anew: Is this all London wits can do? Is this all it possesses? I'd hang my dog up to a stake This moment, if a didn't make 'Pon one leg better vesses. Now this they christen London wit, That leek a razor cutt'th 'Squire Pitt— Aye, let mun make their bregs; Against dree straws I'd bet my soul, That Stephen Tag, of Nacker's Hole, Should beat'n all to regs. PITT AND HIS STATUE; AN EPISTLE TO THE SUBSCRIBERS. Stay but a little month or so, Your fondness will be much abated; Ev'n your own hands will overthrow The idol that ye have created; No more your pyramid supports its rat— Your tiger dwindles to a mangy cat. So then, messieurs, ye men of loans, Who eat our flesh, and gnaw our bones Clean as a dog would pick them, all so white With goodly gratitude ye look To your great friend, the old state cook, And kindly offer him your mite To rear a statue to support his fame, On crutches hobbling—rotten, lank, and lame. 'Tis very kind in ye, I'm sure, Yet 'tis but rouge on an old w?, That can't conceal the wrinkles and the scab: The nation's eyes are vastly clear; Their scrutinizing pow'r severe, Discerns a vestal from a dirty dab. What sort of statue will ye have, To snatch his glory from the grave, That seemeth in a terrible decline? The vulgar statues to surpass, Let it be form'd of kindred brass; In pure Corinthian let your hero shine. Colossal it will be no doubt, To push his head among the gods; Cocking his pert, imperious snout, Much like the bully of old Rhodes. Upon the pedestal his worth, And great achievements, will start forth: In staring capitals I mark reform, With Col'nel Sharman's volunteers The letters sent to Ireland by a noble duke and his associates, in order to force themselves into power, would have furnished the neck of the author of such tr?on of the present day with a halter., With pointed muskets, swords, and spears, To raise for dying liberty a storm. There shall we see the name of war, That many a soldier sends, and tar, To sleep with their still fathers and still mothers; For war, though seeming very dread, By knocking thousands on the head, Makes comfortable elbow-room for others. In letters too, all large and fair, Old Bailey on the eye may stare; Where Justice, with her sharpen'd shears, Has lopp'd off many a liar's ears. In letters too, superb and bold, The name of income-tax be told, That made so many millions blest; And eke of poor old penny-post On Mr. Pitt's silly, cruel, and unproductive imposition on the penny-post letters, I felt for the humbler classes of society, who seem to be born with passions somewhat of the same quality with those of our lofty rulers, and composed a pretty little elegy, called the Tears of the Penny-Post.—The following stanzas are faithful extracts from that tender performance, which on some future day may probably be given entire, for the gratification of the public.—, That gave so sweetly up the ghost, T' oblige the gaping treas'ry's chest. Now tell us where ye mean to place Your fav'rite hero's brazen face? Ev'n at fam'd Newgate let him soar, And swinging grace the debtor's door. After a most pathetic exordium, Madam Penny-Post thus lamenteth THE pensive housemaid, pensive Susan, sighs— Susan, a soft, a sweet, and tender lass; Susan, with rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes, And pouting lips that might for cherries pass. ‘Oh, the vile Pitt!’ she cries—‘poor folks to rob! This with my humble wages won't agree! With pleasure twice a week I wrote to Hob, And Hob, dear youth, wrote twice a week to me. ‘Now only once a week can we afford To breathe our souls on paper—harmless blisses! But what is that to him, the savage?—Lord! Who careth not three straws for woman's kisses. ‘Soon as a maggot crept into my head, I caught a stump of pen and put it down: “What is a penny?” to myself I said; So sent it Hob, a dozen miles from town. ‘Unmov'd by love is Pitt; for lo, at college, He felt no charm in faces, feet, or hips; But hunted, with the proctor, to my knowledge, Poor girls that lent young gentlemen their lips. ‘And when they caught one, like a brace of bears They gripp'd her, swearing she should pay for sinning; And, deaf as haddocks to her squalls and tears, Lugg'd her away, and set her to hard spinning. Ye make too much of this poor man, Stifling your creature with caresses; A simple goose is not a swan— Ye ought to blush at your addresses. ‘But they were paid in their own coin again, For clawing the poor creature—huffing, snubbing; For, with their sticks, with all their might and main, The good young gownsmen gave the brutes a drubbing. ‘Oh, gemini! how I should like to spin A hempen cord th' unnatural rogues to throttle, That give up beauty for a glass of gin, And leave nice girls to hug a nasty bottle! ‘But some low fellows—wretches, let me say (But not my Hobby, I am proud to think), Think eyes were only made to see their way, And mouths for nothing else but meat and drink. ‘The very birds their time on love employ; And see our pigeons how they kiss and coo, And nod, and bill, and flap their wings for joy, And fondly whisper, Dovey, how d'ye do? ‘When Hobby leaves me with a kiss and squeeze, All brisk as bees my spirits in a minute, I twirl my mop about with so much ease, And scrub and sing away like any linnet. ‘With such good will, indeed, I do my work, Thinking of Hob's caresses all the while, I feel my heart a-dancing light as cork, And feed the pigs and poultry with a smile. ‘This, this I swear—Though hungry as a hound, The stomach shall not steal the bosom's bliss; True to Love's passion shall these lips be found, And lose ev'n beans and bacon for a kiss.’ ‘What a great soul is William Pitt! What mind! what energies! what wit! Give him a statue—vote him money! Great creature! greatest thing alive, The lab'ring bee of our large hive: Fill his dear throat with half the honey: His wants are many—ease him, ease him; Ev'n let the nation starve, to please him.’ How like Lord Froth and his dog Faddle This dog story is not imaginary; Portman Square knows all about it, and enjoys its laugh., Who makes his family's head addle With orders, cautions for his Pug! Faddle has got a four-post bed, With pillows for his gentle head, Nice sheets, and comfortable rug, With curtains of the finest chintz, Fit for the chamber of a prince. Faddle, the fav'rite of Lord Froth, Is comforted with richest broth, And victuals, too, of sweetest picking; And while the servants of the house Can scarcely give their plate a mouse, Faddle enjoys his roasted chicken. Is Faddle sick?—Lord! what a yelling! Heav'ns! what a bustle in the dwelling! Susan and Molly, turn and turn, Watch the poor creature night and day, And such solicitude display; And sigh, and hang the head, and mourn; And tread with cat-like step the floor, And with such softness shut the door; Such whispers, and such tiptoe stealings, For fear of wounding Faddle's feelings; And straw is also strew'd before the door, That coaches may not spoil his pretty snore! My lord, too, half his time attending, O'er his sick fav'rite kindly bending, Administers himself, his pills and potions; Tucking with sympathizing tears, The bed-clothes round his chin and ears, Examining, too, all his motions; For fear that Faddle's tender tripes, Poor thing, might suffer by the gripes: And quitting him at night, there's such caressing, When, bishop-like, he leaves the dog his blessing. Now tell me, ev'ry candid cit, The difference between Pug and Pitt I this moment am informed of the actual death of poor Faddle! The ladies are locked up in their rooms, to indulge their melancholy; a death-like silence surrounds the kitchen; not a jack flying; not a spit turning, nor a poker stirring—his lordship inconsolable, carrying about the house his lifeless companion in a box, kissing his cold black muzzle, and bathing it with tears. Cards of condolence are expected from every quarter, and the dog is to be sent, with all pomp, to W?, to be interred with due funereal honours; and to whose precious memory a monument (per-adventure a statue, by the hand of our female Phidias, the honourable Mrs. Damer) is to be erected, with a suitable inscription— Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit, Nulli flebilior quam tibi, Frothii. It is universally avowed, that Faddle was killed by kindness.—Mr. Pitt, the great favourite of his pensioners, placemen, and loanmen, seems to be dying in the very identical manner.—A parallel between the manners of Pug and Pitt may probably form the subject of a future effusion.— Now, to be serious if we can, Speak—are ye laughing at the man? What! to a wolf a statue give, That scarce would suffer us to live; Tearing, poor bleating sheep, our fleeces! Should Honour, Glory ever stray, And meet this statue 'midst their way, They'd pull the folly all to pieces; Exclaiming thus—‘A statue! gods! To one that mischief only plods; A nation's horror—such a known defaulter; If something to his fame must start, Let Master Ketch employ his art, And weave the gentleman a h?.’ I think subsciptions will be thin, For flatt'ring our great nation's hope: Heav'ns! how the guineas had pour'd in, 'Stead of a statue had it been a rope! Before I finish, let me sing, Sweet nightingale, before the king; And warbling tell him, that this fellow, This Pitt, whose virtue d?mns a punk It is a known fact, that when at Cambridge, Pitt delighted in hunting down, with the proctors, the poor unfortunate damsels that came fresh from the country, who only endeavoured to sell their lilies and roses to the young gentlemen, and sometimes to the graver dons, of the university. The man that has not woman in his soul, Is fit for treason, stratagems, and spoils., Though not averse to getting drunk, Ev'n in his soberest moments mellow, Wants much to mount the old state-coach agen, If majesty will give his hand the rein. Yes, much he wants to mount the old state-car, And hear a world his highness hail— But humbler stations suit him better far: What think ye, sirs, of the car's tail? His majesty in wisdom shone, Soon as he brush'd him from the throne; Just to his glory, to his kingdom just: Yet see! the worm crawls round its feet, Wants much to enter it to eat, And render it a heap of rotten dust. As for his knowledge in finance, Not far his majesty need dance Before he found one of a happier wit: In this good nation may be seen, And felt, state-razors full as keen For shaving us, as Master Billy Pitt. Pitts are as plentiful as crabs, Or shall we say Saint Giles's drabs? With nice old proverbs some old books are stor'd; One I remember of a fowl— ‘A man must be hard driv'n to find a bird, Who offers two-pence for an owl.’ Talk of an Irish face of brass, While Pitt exists! let tongues be still— A common to a blade of grass— An ocean to a creeping rill! Why come again upon the heath? Already we have lost our purses— We've nought to give but blasting breath, Deep sighs of poverty, and curses. Pitt licks his lips again at pow'r, Just like a bull-dog that has tasted blood— Wants the bull's nose—ripe to devour, And split his belly with the vital flood. Pitt brings to mind a pupil of the gallows, Part of whose hist'ry is as follows: THE THIEF. A rogue, by Honesty long left, Was by Dame Justice order'd to be stripp'd, And whipp'd, For burglary—that is to say, a theft: A work perform'd by men and boys, Studying the nat'ral history of shops, Who most ingeniously, without a noise, Contrive to ope their unsuspecting chops, Drawing forth money, watches, muslins, laces, With other trinkets, that supply the Graces; Assisted much by Mistress Night, Of whom the Bow-street authors write; A lady, who the world believes Keeps the bad company of thieves. The cat o'-nine-tails to his hide Was most ingeniously applied, Graving upon his mem'ry the word shop— Puss, Pitt-like, deeply drank the purple flood— But, lo! the rogue with Stoic patience stood, As though Puss had not drank a single drop! As soon as Justice had perform'd her part Upon the rogue's unwincing hide, He calmly turn'd his back upon the cart, And, musing, roll'd his eyes from side to side With a most solemn, philosophic face, Like my Lord Eldon, on a crabbed case, Which often comes into the Court of Chancery; Where his grave lordship, and grave wig, Both with the first importance big, Are very often puzzled how to answer ye; So very undecisive in decision, Leaving for future chancery-traps provision. ‘Well! what art thinking of?’ exclaim'd Jack Ketch— ‘Thy brain seems dev'lish hard upon the stretch.’ ‘I'm thinking,’ quoth the thief, with sharpen'd ken, ‘Of gutting that there shop to-night agen.’ Now, gentle sirs, pray ope your eyes, And learn the art of being wise: Your schemes are idle wholly, wholly: Ye show a wondrous want of wit; Th' immortal statue rais'd to Pitt, Immortalizeth too—your folly. Stay but a little month or so, Your fondness will be much abated; Ev'n your own hands will overthrow The idol that ye have created: No more your pyramid supports its rat— Your tiger dwindles to a mangy cat. LORD B? AND HIS MOTIONS. You call yourself a pillar of the nation! I fear your lordship means to boast: Pray make a trifling alteration; And, 'stead of pillar, say a post. Great Lord of Greek! it is my humble notion, That yours was verily a paw paw motion; Much like a motion by the doctor's art Produc'd, by jalap or by sal cathart, Working for Cloacina and her maids, In water-closets and embowering shades. You've learnt to face a knock-down laugh, And though detected in a blunder, And though your fancied corn be chaff, You will not keep your windmill under. No matter how folks grin, or what folks say, 'Tis your own mill, and mill shall grind away. Too many a goose hath deem'd itself a swan, And many a monkey thought himself a man; With reason, too, for 'mongst the monkey nation I've met with many a happy imitation; Nay, if to speak the truth compell'd, I've seen the originals excell'd! How many a man, because he has two eyes, Thinks himself capable of seeing; And finding he has motion, and calf-size, Believes himself an animated being! Discovering in his mouth a tongue; He must not its palaver balk; So keeps it running all day long, And fancies the red rag can talk. Your lordship tells me that I joke, Swearing you never saw such folk: If that's the case, upon my word, You keep no looking-glass, my lord. Numbers are fond of hearing themselves chatter, Promising wine and giving milk and water, Or that most mawkish mess call'd water-gruel; This is not fair, my lord—'tis very cruel. Most men of splendid fortunes, glittering titles, Think that in wisdom they must also shine; As though a house whose front is very fine Could not want handsome furniture and victuals. You thought a speech would be the bladder, To speak more pompously, balloon; Nay, let me rather say the ladder To mount your lordship to the moon; It was a fatal resolution (Ambition oft mistakes its aim), 'Twas not the ladder of your fame, Alas! but of your execution. If Pitt was wonderfully great With wisdom, wit, and fire replete, Sublime, gigantic, half a god, 'Tis strange he should descend to you And yours, so ignorant a crew— This is a puzzling case, and odd. And yet we see, without surprise, A log of wood, a needle, nail, O'er the fierce lightning oft prevail, And lure the tyrant from his skies; Send him about, a poor tame thing, Just like a lap-dog in a string. There is a certain and true saying Of animals inclin'd to braying; (My lord, I hope to be forgiv'n) ‘An ass's voice ne'er reach'd to Heav'n.’ There lives a lady, christen'd Vanity, Companion often of Inanity, Much like a finch that feeds the bird of May, Call'd cuckoo—a most silly bird, Resembling my dear Grecian lord, Resembling speakers that have nought to say; For words are not ideas, although words Are in such plenty found with noble lords. 'Tis said some men may make their wills On their thumb-nails, for aught they can bestow; And pray, my lord, whose voice St. Stephen's fills, I should be very glad to know If all your wits and eloquence's grace Might not be all bequeath'd in the same space? Had I the pow'r, my first endeavour Should be to stop your mouth for ever; And really I am pleas'd when Sherry, With his smart stick, Unto your shrugging shoulders gives a lick; Making the pleas'd spectators merry. And yet in spite of Sherry's sneers, And my admonitory metre, Your eloquence must drown our ears, Must flow—labitur et labetur. In short, this motion said, of thanks, Seems one of Folly's weakest pranks: Great is Imagination's pow'r! Fancy boults bran and thinks it flour; And thus when Pitt was boulted on the nation; Numbers, to superstition giv'n, Thought it a meteor dropp'd from heav'n; Such was the effort of Imagination! Yet if we judge from deeds and fiery face, This meteor issued from a hotter place. My lord, I hold your knowledges dog-cheap; Sad work, indeed, indeed, you make; You're like one ambulating in his sleep, That does the actions of a man awake: Leaps, runs, stands, listens, rides—and then Unconscious goes to bed agen. ‘And am I that poor mechanism?’ you cry. My lord of Greek, I say it with a sigh. You call yourself a pillar of the nation; I fear your lordship means to boast; Pray make a trifling alteration, And 'stead of pillar, say a post, You cannot make, my lord, I fear, A velvet purse of a sow's-ear. I grant your life a virtuous life; I had it from the baker's wife Pious and pretty—residing in the vicinity of Milbank, much addicted to methodism, and one of the elect!— The fascinating Muffinilla; Who, visiting your lordship's villa, Inform'd you how the fiend with foot all cloven, And horns, and tail, and goggling eyes, Tried to take people by surprise, And that he lurk'd within her Sunday's oven A strict observance of the Sabbath-day had long engrossed his lordship's pious and sublime speculation. The wicked bakehouse fell first in his way; and, had not the motion been smelt and smoked by the House, his lordship had proceeded in his triumph to a most tremendous attack on milk and mackerel.; And then she begg'd your lordship's help to stop Her oven, and drive Satan from her shop. The tears of piety and sweet devotion That, trickling, wash'd the roses of her cheek, Produc'd, undoubtedly produc'd the motion; What's strange, without one syllable of Greek— A motion that most humbly hop'd The lady's oven might be stopp'd. 'Tis said, moreover, that the spouse Of this same honest Millbank baker Has charms, has beauty, that might rouse A smile on any undertaker. But what of that? 'twas not the smile, Nor eyes that might a saint beguile, Nor Muffinilla's dimple sleek, That won upon the lord of Greek. Nor was it Muffinilla's cheek, The blushing rival of the rose; Nor swelling with desire, her neck, Fair rival of the Alpine snows. Nor was it Muffinilla's waist, The throne of chastity, her pride; Whose zone, so chaste, so very chaste, None but the baker's self untied. Nor was it Muffinilla's arm, That might a cold Marchesi warm; Nor hand possess'd of such nice points, Such fingers, all so round and taper, Whose touch would make an angel caper— And then such sweetly-dimpled joints! Nor was it Muffinilla's foot, Nor ancle clean, nor tapering leg, All near Millbank, in high repute; These ne'er had made him stir a peg. No! 'twas a rage for curbing evil, And drubbing that vile dog the Devil. No! 'twas to break the legs of Sin, Who dances in the pie and pudding; A bramble, hooking Christians in, For ever blossoming and budding. And yet the world won't give you credit; They say it, and have boldly said it;— ‘Who work for Virtue?—poh! a pretty story! Who would not rather toil for Vice, Her pay and pleasures great and nice? Who fish for haddock that can hook John Dory? ‘Let Virtue preach, and Beauty ogle, To gain the soul—Lord? which will win? A pair of minutes ends the struggle— Poor Parson Virtue must give in.’ ‘'Tis no fair bet,’ the million cries; ‘Pit Virtue 'gainst a pair of eyes! A peacock and a rusty wren! Jove's eagle 'gainst a cackling hen. ‘A roguish leer from charming Phillis, Of which th' interpretation's clear, Viz.—‘Look, sir; please to buy my lilies, My cherries, and my roses here?’ Most archly pointing to her neck, And pouting lips, and crimson'd cheek. Ev'n metropolitans of London Would find their pious efforts undone; And eke the solemn saints of Canterbury Might from their holy office slide, Feeling of love a strong spring-tide, And passions, bustling, running hurry scurry. Nay, metropolitans of York Would find it an Herculean work To keep the imp of darkness under: If so, a weak and carnal lord, With little stock of grace on board, For him to founder, where's the wonder?’ Thus cries the world, my lord, all sneering; On Muffinilla's beauty leering. Now, my good lord, if you think fit, We'll leave the baker's wife for Pitt: Some gratitude is due, I own, To your staunch patron, Billy Pitt; He took much care of you, 'tis known; A louse most surely loves its nit. Yes, Pitt took most especial care To shield his stupid friends from harm; And, when the day of trouble came, To keep them safe, and snug, and warm. Full oft he sav'd them from hard knocks Of wicked Sheridan and Fox. Thus, when old mother hen, for food, Is prying, scraping, clucking, picking, Amidst her scudding, squeaking brood, The poor weak band of hungry chicken; Soon as the winds begin to sing, Or rather play their overture to thunder, Immediately she spreads her wing, For all her trembling chicks to huddle under. For God's sake talk no more of Pitt, His taste, his wisdom, or his wit! A man with music in his soul, Would never keep vile squalling parrots, Nor leave a haunch and salmon's jowl, To dine upon sheeps'-heads and carrots, Whose palate wish'd to be thought chaste, And get some small repute for taste. Yet Pitt could keep his squalling parrots, And dine upon sheeps'-heads and carrots, When nightingales had waited on his wish, And every table dainty, flesh and fish. Now why that stare, my lord? By G? 'tis true: Ye moths that flutter'd in his ray, The fav'rite insects of the day, I talk of you, and you, and you, and you. What need I name what all the world supposes? The B?ves, W?dh?ms, G?ffords, C?ings, R?es. My lord, I've not one grain of spite; I only wish to set you right, And save your future hours from folly; Of idle vanity the slaves, Our men of rank are food for knaves; A common fact, and melan-cholly! Keen parasites, whose cunning gains Most plenteous crops from barren brains. They bid you talk—my honest song Bids you for ever hold your tongue; Silence with some, is wisdom most profound; Crack'd pipkins are discover'd by the sound. Now, good Lord B?, to conclude; Since so unmannerly, so rude, The Dev'l is pleas'd our hearts to harden Against your state schemes and devotions; Whene'er you choose to make more motions, Begin and end them in the garden. PROH IMPUDENTIAM! AN ODE. Pretending love for his dear country, Not love for his dear self and dear relation, Pitt came with all the family effrontery, And took possession of the highest stations: Began of politics the game: Gambled and lost; But who must answer for the cost? Not he, indeed!—a duck confounded lame, Not unattended, waddling—no—the nation Sent after him her warmest execration. How like the gambler!—betting high— A thousand on the spinning die! For him, poor dev'l, a large amount!— He lost—but how must he account? ‘Well!’ quoth the fellow, ‘Gemmen, kick away; For, curse me if I've got one doit to pay! Pitt brings to mind—a father to his son: ‘Tom, you are going into trade; A handsome fortune may, perhaps, be won; Perhaps you fail—don't be dismay'd, And let your modesty ambition stifle, So, do not be a bankrupt for a trifle; TEMPORA MUTANTUR. AN ODE. Fond is the human heart of pow'r! Indeed, it cannot be denied: We see the tyrant ev'ry hour, Stuff'd, like a pincushion, with pride. Pride is a very stubborn evil— Set but a beggar on a horse, Lord! what will be the fellow's course? The knave will gallop to the devil. Pitt with his green bag once look'd small, Could beg and pray in yonder Hall, Courting the honour of a brief; Ready to plead for any thing, Jacobin, traitor to his k—, And every despicable thief. But leaving off, at length, brief-mumping, And strangely into office jumping; Adieu, the modest, asking face! Features assume a diff'rent form: The calm is banish'd—and the storm, With all its blust'ring insolence, takes place. Nothing his grandeur could withstand! Hustling and bullying, such a rout! In short, the noblest of the land Were just like foot-balls kick'd about. How like the negro on his mule; Tormenting him beyond all rule; Beating him o'er the head and ears, His spurs into the creature sticking, Abusing, damning, cursing, kicking— For Blacky, like a Christian swears. His quondam master, passing by, Beheld the beast with pitying eye— ‘You scoundrel, hold!—is murder your design? Quako turn'd round, with a broad grin, Not valuing the rebuke one pin— ‘Massa, me was your nega—dissy mine.’ When Pitt is the subject, I scarcely know when to remit the lash, he is such a feast for satire. Should he be restored to that power (which, let me say, he in a manner usurped, and which he now fawningly courts), our liberties will have reason to tremble. The calamities of kingdoms have often been produced by the sole ignorance of a minister; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of humanity, that our late misfortunes arose solely from that pitiable source, and not from the dark, turbid bosom of malignity and vengeance. GREAT CRY AND LITTLE WOOL; OR, THE SQUADS IN AN UPROAR; OR, THE PROGRESS OF POLITICS, OR, EPISTLES, POETICAL AND PICTURESQUE. WRITTEN BY TOBY SCOUT, ESQ. A Member of the Opposition; AND EDITED BY PETER PINDAR, ESQ. Qui vult decipi, decipiatur. Had Britain an atom of wit, And wish'd her lost health to regain; She would kick out the mountebank P?, And consult her old doctor again. Ah! silly John Bull, or John Ass, Deserving full many a drub; Thy long ears can with pleasure let pass Any lie, any Tale of a Tub! Surrounded by wolves—a gaunt pack— With praise and fair promise they treat thee, And so thick is thy head-piece, poor Jack, Thou suspect'st not their plan is—to eat thee! TO N? S?, ESQ. EPISTLE I. Prepare thy two ears, Cousin Nic Nicholas Scout, Esq. of the city of York, a gentleman of Fortune, and a first cousin of Toby Scout, Esq. The letters were written at the commencement of his majesty's late unfortunate indisposition.; Lo! our senses are all of employ full; And our stomachs of poverty sick, Will speedily sing, ‘O be joyful!’ Hope peeps from a cloud on our squad, Whose beams have been long in deep mourning: 'Tis a lane, let me tell ye, my lad, Dev'lish long, that has never a turning. But now for this nice bit of news— Know, our worthy old monarch is dying! If we mind but our P's and our Q's, We shall quickly be roasting and frying. Yes, Fame will soon publish aloud, Of good eating and drinking a story; As the sun of Pall-Mall from his cloud, Will soon be ascending in glory. Cousin Nicholas, credit the muse, Who scorns to report a false tale; That the minister shakes in his shoes— Harpoon'd is our mighty state-whale! How he flounders about, and makes fun, Poor Mister Leviathan Addy! Lo, his grandeur, so lately a sun, Is sinking (sad fall!) to a caddy. Yes, poor Addy, is deep in a bog; A nice pickle, you well may suppose— Yery like, between sawyers a log, His sharp-tooth'd good friends, and his foes. Yes, the fellow will get a dry shave; His chops will be held pretty fast; And, thank God, Cousin Nic, we shall have The loaves and the fishes at last. Believe ev'ry sentence I speak: Sailing orders are issued—and mind, G?'s anchor is really a-peak, Sails all set, with an excellent wind! The Doctors, good servants of Death, Are call'd in, and prescribing their slop! When thou wishest to shorten thy breath, Nic, send for pill, potion, and drop. Yes, the quacks are call'd suddenly in— Pepys, Heberden, Reynolds, and Millman! Who would now for his life give a pin? Four! enough, without fever, to kill man. ‘In a number of counsellors,’ Nic, ‘There is wisdom’—so says the black cloth. Yet a proverb as good we may pick, And as old—‘The more cooks the worse broth.’ On the call for the knights of the potion, Some look pleasant, and others full sad: All London in short is in motion, And much on th' alert is our squad. The tradesman, once proud of the feather The crest of the prince's arms., Now cast higher glory their eye on— Soap, herrings, wigs, mousetraps, and leather, Are all looking out for a lion. The tailors cross-legg'd on their boards, Needle-arm'd, hand-extended, prepar'd To stab the black cloth with their swords, The instant the death is declar'd. And likewise the milliners all, Arm'd with scissars and pins, on the gape; On the blacks with dire fury to fall, And cut through deep columns of crape. Such a mob around Buckingham-house, Like shrimps all together they cling, That there's scarce room enough for a mouse, So alarm'd for the life of the king! From the mountain, and forest, and fen, (What a tumult, and bellow, and roar!) Rush the beasts to peep into his den, To spy if good Leo's no more. T. S. EPISTLE II. Thurlow now is the Carleton-house mentor! You know him, Nic—bony and big, With a voice like the voice of a Stentor; His old phiz in a bushel of wig. All the pages, and footmen, and maids, As his wisdom march'd solemnly in, (The impudent varlets and jades!) Gather'd round him with wonder and grin. Cousin Nic, thou hast hawk'd, I'm sure, And witness'd a large German owl, Hopping forth with a visage demure, To attract all the nations of fowl. At once all the birds of the air, Grey, and yellow, green, brown, black, and blue, Flock around him with chatter and stare— ‘Whence d'ye come? who the devil are you?’ All our laws he will sagely expound, Give the parson a twig by the ear; And to add to the graces of sound, He will teach his new pupil to swear. At some of his thoughts you would wonder; Rudely utter'd, we dare not deny; He resembles a loud clap of thunder, That frightens and brightens the sky. Yet this in his praise I will say, That whether he's sober or mellow, Though as blunt as a bear in his way, True genius admires the old fellow. ‘So much for old gravity!’ Nic, Thou exclaimest, ‘Oh! tempora mutantur!’ Or swear'st I'm clapping a trick.— Cousin Nic, I'll be c?rs'd if I banter. T. S. EPISTLE III. O friendship, thy sighs I revere! Sweet balm on the heart that has bled! O Love, what a treasure thy tear! A rich pearl on the tomb of the dead. How d'ye relish this flight? rather rare, And sublime for the lead of these days! And now let me talk of a fair, Sweet object of pity and praise. To Blackheath when the messenger came, And announc'd the small hopes of a cure, He expected a smile from the dame, With a purse for his news, to be sure. When she put her white hand to her pocket, He thought some rare gift would appear. Ah! her handkerchief only!—She took it, Sweet mourner, to hold a fond tear; A tear to which Friendship gave birth, And Love, of the Passions the queen; Pure pearl! had it dropp'd to the earth, In treasure how rich it had been! When he said that the little and great, That kings, like their subjects, must die; She look'd up with a visage so sweet, Bade farewell, with so tender a sigh? Her fate is uncommonly cruel— Yet a lustre she casts on her race— By the lord, Cousin Nic, she's a jewel, And her heart is as fair as her face. But Scandal has always her mud, At Merit, poor Merit, to throw; Of ink has for ever a flood, To blacken a bosom of snow! Sweet stranger! from splendour withdrawn, On wisdom and charity bent, To Health, and the breeze of the lawn, To the cottage of Peace and Content. Cousin Nic, with the subject I'm fir'd— Yes! I've really drunk deep of the stream; Yet a goose must be really inspir'd, When the Virtues and Loves are the theme. T. S. EPISTLE IV. I met mother H?n in the Park; The dam of our great Master C?nn?g; Forth flying, as brisk as a lark, With her daughters perspiring and fanning! ‘Lord bless me! my dear Mister Scout, I'm this moment come up in the hoy: I'm so glad, then, to find ye here out; Lord! Lord! I'm transparent with joy. ‘Let's sit down upon one of the benches— Tell one t'other what each of us hears: But first, sir, these girls are my wenches— Jolly jades, Mister Scout, for their years. ‘I'll sell no more ointments It is called Costello's Collirium, which has experienced a most uncommon sale, from the very fortunate circumstance of having opened the eyes of the Heaven-born minister, who, to exhibit to the world a rich specimen of disinterested gratitude, saddled the nation with pensions on Madam H?n, the Miss H?ns, alias C?nn?gs, alias Reddishes; a pension on her husband, Mr. Richard H?n; a place in the West Indies for one Master Reddish, and military promotion in the East for the other; and to crown the whole, a pension for poor Uncle Tommy, the tinker of Somers Town. What a beautiful nest of caterpillars, ordained by the Heaven-born œconomical minister to devour the few remaining leaves of the old oak! THE EDITOR., not me! No! that would my consequence level! Great prefarment I quickly shall see, So my boxes may roll to the Devil. You have heard, Mister Scout, I suppose, How I got my nice little appointment: Mister Pitt, sir, whom ev'ry one knows— I open'd his winkers with ointment! ‘So raw and so swelled was each eye, He could not peep out of a hole: Sir, it is not a bit of a lie, The man was as blind as a mole! ‘Sir, administration is weak; Water-gruel! no more, Mister Scout. We shall soon hear the minister squeak; We shall hear him for mercy cry out. ‘You remember, Lord North, the great ox, How he ran in a frighted condition, And bellow'd to Portland and Fox, And so form'd the fine fam'd coalition. ‘This will happen agen, if we please! Yes, yes, and the thing shall be done; And Addington crawl on his knees, And bellow to Pitt and my son. ‘We shall get out the statue at last! It shall be brought forward—it must— Yes, yes, we'll make up for the past: I'll kick up a dev'l of a dust. ‘Mister Scout, we can now muster strong— This day will I go to the grocer's, And give him a spice of my tongue, And call them great fat-headed dozers. ‘I'll have Pitt, in nice gingerbread, too, Finely gilt, with the anchor of Hope; And thus will expose him to view, In the baker's and pastry-cook's shop. ‘There are numbers of methods, no doubt, By which popularity's made, And I know them all, Master Scout; I think I'm no fool in that trade. ‘I would take forth an owl from his hole, (Now I don't mean a sarcasm on Pitt); And I'd put the grave bird on a pole, And the nation should kneel to tee-whit. ‘You have heard of his marriage, I guess— Nice match! oh, a very nice match! Half a million of money! not less! O Lord! 'twas a beautiful catch! ‘Yet how mortally proud they all be! Three days, sir, before the grand wedding, Bundled off were my daughters and me; Pack'd off in the mail, bed and bedding. ‘For we wern't of importance enough, Our court to great people to pay; And so we were all order'd off, For fear of disgracing the day! ‘But the pride of the Scots was so hurt, When they found we sold bobbin and inkle! O Lord! 'twas descending to dirt; It was coupling a whale with a winkle. ‘I dare swear, if I sat by her side, Her elbow away she would twitch, For fear of her elegant hide— I might probably give her the itch! ‘Proud ma'am need not toss up her nose, Who, perhaps, owes her fortune to jobbin: A shop is no sin, I suppose. And Jobbin's no better than bobbin. ‘I could whisper a word to a Scot, That amongst the great munchers of currie General Scott, the father of Mrs. Canning, made an immense fortune in the East Indies, by his profession, and a lucky throw of the dice., That lacks are not easily got, Not honestly made in a hurry. ‘'Slife! what's all her money to me, That I'm to be clapp'd on the shelf? Thank Heav'n, I'm as wholesome as she, And a Christian as good as herself. ‘What signify riches and titles? What signifies richness of blood? Or what ev'n the nicest of victuals, If a body ben't vartuous and good? ‘Pray had Adam and Eve an estate, Poor souls, when they dropp'd from the moon? No! they had not a knife nor a plate, Not a table, nor dish, nor a spoon. ‘Does she think I ha'n't larn'd to behave? Does she think I caan't sit to a table? That my parents good scholarship gave, To eat hay with a horse in a stable? ‘That my meat, like a hound, I should tug; That, hog-like, my grinders would work? Does she think I should cough in the mug, And pick all my teeth with a fork? ‘Or snuffle and grunt in my broth, Then whisk out a mouthful of wind; Lick my plate, for to save the clean cloth, And drink healths to the fellows behind? ‘Does she think I was born to be dumb? Of my tongue, that I have not the use? Made to listen, and stare, and be mum, And cannot say, ‘Boh!’ to a goose? ‘She thinks I'm a heathen, no doubt, Some outlandish beast—that I howl! I waan't born, no, indeed, Mister Scout, In a wood, to be scar'd by an owl! ‘Ups and downs we all see, Master Scout— This world makes a terrible touse; Here and there, sir—some in, and some out; Now a man, and next minute a mouse. ‘Son C?nn?g shall start up a lord! Great speaker! a wonderful thinker! A staff for my boy of the sword; Rank for Richard, and Tommy the tinker. ‘My girls will so blaze on the town, Their chariots and phaetons sporting; Billet-douxing with bucks, derry down! Such a kettle of fish! such a courting! ‘Lord St. Vincent must go—he shall go— His anchor's a-peak, never doubt it— For the man for his office, you know, Is the man who knows nothing about it. ‘Lord! what has he done worth admiring? No huge mighty matters, depend on't! A little hard fighting and firing, And boarding, and so there's an end on't! ‘Well! Heav'ns bless ye! call soon on me, pray, To settle th' affairs of the nation— I now can afford to be gay; And we'll have a nice jollification.’ Thus ended this nightingale's song! What a bore, Cousin Nic! what a clack! What a cock-and-bull tale, what a tongue! Zounds! 'twould distance the fly of a jack! EPISTLE VII. Corinna talks loud in her airs! ‘I will have what I've fix'd my delight on— A fig for some people! who cares? Nothing less than the Duchess of Brighton! ‘Ye dames all so pure and so chaste, Who have blink'd me, I'll handsomely swinge! Of the cup of Contempt ye shall taste, Or I ne'er knew the sweets of revenge! ‘With envy your pride shall be kill'd— To my circles ye shall not be beckon'd; With princes my rooms shall be fill'd; And my name shall be Ninon the Second. ‘I know who dar'd squint at my routs! I know who ne'er ask'd me to theirs, Who turn'd up their impudent snouts; For their honour, Lord! fill'd with such fears! ‘I've a catalogue fair of nice dames— A pretty black list of each chit: And if Vengeance, dear Vengeance, have flames, The torch shall be speedily lit! ‘Too long have I acted the dove: I will soon play the part of the viper; I will rant like the mistress of Jove! I shall dance, and the ? pay the piper.’ The lady is clever and pleasant; Much a fav'rite, of yore, with the men; Nice picking about her—a pheasant! Now tasteless and tough—an old hen! Though the Loves are all fled, the young elves, With the actions of youth she will bore us— Time always stands still with ourselves! We think the world grows old before us! Toad-eaters rush in like a tide, To their int'rest most lovingly steady; And to tickle the trout of her pride, She's be-grac'd and be-duchess'd already! Is she beautiful? so much the better: By this magic thy business is done; One half of a word, or a letter, Is enough—'tis the sine quânon. O Beauty, how form'd to beguile! Thy charm will for ever endure; Lo, the loftiest, seduc'd by thy smile, Descend, like the hawk, to the lure! Thy pride, I suppose, may be hurt— But the world is a dev'lish queer stick. Dost thou wish for the smiles of a court? Make love to a petticoat, Nic. EPISTLE VIII. Cousin Nic, couldst thou see some court faces! Most rueful indeed! a yard long— Gone, gone are the smiles and the graces; Most capital subjects for song! I've just met with some of the crew: Bull-head C?rd?n, dead in the dumps; Salisb'ry, looking confoundedly blue, And his countess as blue as poor Numps. Maids of honour, all wand'ring about, Are seen with a sorrowful air— With their lily-white handkerchiefs out— Sad flags, cousin Nic, of despair! Old Liver—you know who I mean— Old Jenk—of the closet old rats— Will feel his bones cracking, I ween, (Heav'n grant it!) by one of our cats! Smart lads in the council will shine, Instead of the stupid and tubbish; Choice spirits, instead of dull swine; Bright Jewels, instead of old rubbish. The bed-chamber lords are in dudgeon; And cropsick the grooms and the pages, As if struck on the head with a bludgeon, Seem to say, ‘Farewell honour and wages!’ The cooks, in a pitiful stew, The scullions, half out of their wits— ‘Adieu to the platters! Adieu To the dripping-pans, sauce-pans, and spits!’ Lord Salisb'ry's poor butler and groom, With other young knights of the mews, And other young knights of the broom, For their places all shake in their shoes. As a whisper is current abroad, When the prince shall arrive at the throne, Farewell to the farce of an ode; Thus the ‘Black's occupation is gone.’ Or should this same ode be in vogue, Musicians will come Unfortunately for the credit of his majesty's band of music, it is not composed of musicians, but of people of mean occupations, who receive the salaries; and hire, for a trifling sum, performers to fiddle for them.—Lord Salisbury knows all about it. from that class Which know the sweet lark from a hog; Braham's voice from the bray of an ass! Pitt is just like a fox for a hen, Slily squinting and creeping about, Snuffing wildly the wind—but what then, If Dame Partlet refuse to come out? How cut down!—from the line to a lugger!— The grocers observe him at Dover, And may send him a pound of brown sugar; But as to the statue, 'tis over. Ah! Lucifer, son of the morning, How fall'n! ah! how lost all thy light! No longer the heavens adorning!— Poor planet—good night t'ye—good night! And yet—though the fellow I hate, I still must acknowledge his merit; Though his quack'ries and insolent state I despise, let me honour his spirit. Retir'd, from political battle, To his castle to learn to be wary, He astonies the fields and the cattle, With tactics yclep'd mili-tary! He has got all the technicals, pat— Studying Saxe and Vauban, night and day; And already has kill'd one ram cat, Three magpies, two owls, and a jay! Over hedges and ditches and quags, Huge feats he is seen to perform! He has torn a poor dunghill to rags, And taken a bog-house by storm! To Pitt, are all weapons alike:— With his bayonet he stabb'd an old sow; He pierc'd a large calf with a pike, And slew with a broad-sword the cow. Many rams has he tumbled about, And crack'd of some yearlings the skull; Put of oxen a score to the rout, And leap'd on the back of the bull! For his tutor, he takes Gen'ral Moore, As great in a battle his skill is; And thus a fit Chiron, I'm sure, For instructing his pupil Achilles. Together for glory they run! If a hedge-hog they meet, he is dead! If a squirrel—bounce, off goes a gun! If a mushroom—smack, off goes his head! Is a stump of a tree in their way? With a fury heroic they rend it! Is a mole-hill? in battle array, In column, they march to defend it! On counterscarps, curtains, and ravelins, Mines, sausages, bridges, and ditches; Pikes, bayonets, and ramrods, and javelins, Palisadoes, and guns, and their breeches— They so talk! such a hist'ry of wars! Ev'n at meal-times untir'd is the tongue; When, lo! with the voice of a Mars, They sing of proud triumph the song. INVITATION TO BONAPARTE: A DUET, By Mr. Pitt and General Moore. BONAPARTE, come over: We will meet thee at Dover; And the generals our forces commanding Will salute thy two ears With three excellent cheers, And a warm Cornish hug, at thy landing. Louis, Jerome, and Jo, Let us see too, and know, With thy uncles and aunts—a brave band: Bring likewise thy cousins, Of whom thou hast dozens— And bring the old fox, Talleyrand. Thou'lt be frighten'd to see How brisk we shall be, To bestow ev'ry thing in our pow'r: Most excellent air; Nice lodgings to spare; Ev'n the best to be found in the Tower. As French manners are thine, And so very divine! Thou never wilt fail of delight; As the monkeys by day Will chatter away; And the tigers howl music at night! As thou oft did protest, That a fight is a feast; And as no man, indeed, can be thinner; Thou shalt have—not a pullet, But a dainty hot bullet, And a pike for thy teeth, after dinner! Come the Consul whenever he will— And he means it, when Neptune is calmer— Pitt will send him a d?mn'd bitter pill From his fortress, the castle of Walmer! T. S. EPISTLE IX. Last night I dropp'd in on a club; The great Mister Squibb in the chair— Who became a grand bear, from a cub— Important in look as lord may'r: Or a certain law lord of our days, A great un-deciding decider; Very rarely a subject of praise; But oft of a wicked derider! Who hems with much wisdom, and ha's— And seldom concludes in a minute: And whose wig might as well in a cause Be employ'd, as the head that is in it! Thou hast witness'd, full many a time, The magic that waits upon place— Where the note of the owl is sublime, And sheer grease a fine sample of grace!— From the coal and the smoke of his shop To the bench let black Mulciber move; Lo! his tools into consequence hop, And his sledge is the sceptre of Jove! Squibb now with much gravity rose— A most solemn and sanctified look! ‘Pray inform us all, what you suppose Is our s?v?gn's complaint, Mister Puke!’ Puke answer'd—‘Indeed, Mister Squibb, Of opinions, I'm not a free giver; But, I think, that a child with a bib Must pronounce the disease in the liver! Now Gripe started up, in his pride, Whom no death of a patient affrights: ‘Mister Puke, you and I differ wide— 'Tis no more in the liver than lights.’ Puke, nettled, now answer'd and said, ‘Though your wisdom was never suspected; If I know any thing of my trade, Mister Gripe, 'tis the liver's affected.’ Sir, I dont think you do,’ answer'd Gripe, With a smile, and a squint, and a leer— Now Puke, in a rage at this wipe, Thought of dealing a box on the ear! But sagely suspecting return, And possessing some love for his hide, He was forc'd in his bowels to burn, And submit, to Dame Prudence, Miss Pride. How few boast the wisdom of Puke— A present, not ev'ry man's lot!— How easier to bear a rebuke, Than a sword in the heart or a shot! Honour likes to shoot, stab, and slice, When affronted—wild, panting for blood! Very strange, that a lady so nice Should prefer such indelicate food! ‘Well,’ quoth Puke, ‘thou shalt have thy own way, Master Gripe, or to prate or to kill;— Allow me the freedom to say— Thou art vox et præterea nil!’ ‘Well,’ quoth Gripe, ‘what hast thou been a saying? Master Puke, that redounds to thy glory? Goose gabbling—a jack-ass's braying!— To talk Latin—mere nugæ canoræ!’ To high words now the disputants rose, Indeed, words not in flattery rich— Gripe talk'd loudly of pulling a nose; Master Puke talk'd of kicking a breech! ‘Thy physic,’ quoth Gripe, ‘is all slop! Not fig for a pig, or a porter: Could I catch thee but once in my shop, I would pound thee to dust in my mortar.’— ‘With such fellows,’ quoth Puke, in disdain, ‘I scorn, like a blackguard to wrestle; Yet, Gripe, had thy head any brain, I would dash it all out with my pestle!’ The company now interfer'd, To set those hot matters to rights— They drank friends—and no longer was heard— The dispute between liver and lights.— And, as now, cousin Nic, I beg leave (As labour and I don't agree) To my pen a small respite to give— And indulge in a pinch of rappee. Peace now being happily made, Up rose, on his legs, Master Sly: And thus to the chairman he said— Whilst ‘Hear him! hear! hear! was the cry. ‘Sir! administration is weak! Very feeble—exceedingly, sir— It has not a man that can speak— Not a tongue on a topic to stir! ‘The premier, I grant very good— Fit to join with his wife in debate; Prescribe a child's physic and food— But he should not prescribe for a state. ‘His judgment on mutton and beef, I allow him without hesitation— And of tea, too, it is my belief, There is no sounder judge in the nation ‘In a boarding-school, too, he might shine, And make a most excellent teacher; Nay more—make a decent divine, And, per-haps—prove a popular preacher! ‘But we want, sir, a man of deep thought, Of political, sharp, penetrations— In the school of experience, sir, taught; Well vers'd in the int'rests of nations: ‘The man from intrigue who refrains; Scorns to creep, spaniel-like, to disgrace; Who, firm in his virtue, disdains To enrich an old cat, for his place. ‘The man who would die for the state— Of freedom, the glorious defender; Not a fellow of infinite prate— Not a noisy and bullying pretender. ‘Not the man who encourages spies; For poor liberty laying the snare; Affected no more by her cries, Than a poacher, by squeaks of a hare. ‘Not a childish, vindictive, poor fool, Against men who may smile at his name, Who fancies the praise of each tool Nothing less than the plaudit of Fame. ‘'Tis the man who, sublime, for the state His neck to the axe would submit, To bless it—to snatch it from fate; And that man!—is the great William Pitt! ‘Great man! who ev'n kings would resist, And pawn for the realm his last shirt; Too virtuous to make civil list The fount of corruption and dirt!— ‘Great man! so sublime in his station! The pilot who weather'd the storm! Good man! who ne'er promis'd the nation A thing which he did not perform!— ‘How nobly from office he went! Great man!—not a doit in his fob! Great man, with his conscience content, Retiring as poor as poor Job!— ‘He wish'd not to burthen the nation— He wish'd not for mountains of pelf! He wish'd for his country's salvation— He never once thought of himself! ‘Other barks on the ocean of time Shall be lost! into atoms shall split! While, tow'ring in triumph sublime, Through the foam, moves the great William Pitt! ‘Of sweet woman he courts not the smile— Of Venus, ne'er seen in the school— An animal, rare in our isle— Heav'n grant that he mayn't be a mule!’ I do not allude to the proverbial quality of that animal, but to his well-known inability of perpetuating his species. Having finish'd his splendid oration, Down solemnly sat Master Sly; When lo! of a diff'rent persuasion, Up rose, in much form, Dicky Dry:— ‘Mister Chairman, the very neat speech Just deliver'd by good Mister Sly, Demonstrates how well he can preach— His assumptions, I beg to deny. ‘Sir, 'tis no very difficult matter To be florid, and roundly assert— With irony, names to bespatter; And characters cover with dirt. ‘I allow his oration is neat— Full of point, sir, I freely admit; But, sir, the distinction is great, Very great, between wisdom and wit! ‘Mister Sly must be surely in sport, So ill is the character suited; Mister Sly may have found out his port— Not the talents and virtues imputed. ‘Survey him in Westminster-Hall— Poor youth! not a brief in his bag! There he look'd very small—very small! Not a client to make his tongue wag! ‘Next behold him in league with a duke, Busy then as the Devil in a storm, Attempting poor gudgeons to hook With a bait—a fine bait, call'd reform! ‘Pretty doctrines they scatter'd around! Pretty letters to Sharman they wrote! Sir, I quickly should visit Lob's pound, Should I dare ev'n a passage to quote! ‘Master Aris and I, very soon, Should be trying of handcuffs a pair; When his honour would teach me a tune— Bread and water—a fav'rite old air. ‘Well! at length Master Billy got in— Arriv'd at the summit of power; What's reform?—Oh! a d?nable sin— A dæmon, from that very hour. ‘Now terrier, cur, spaniel, and hound (No matter, rain, sun-shine, or storm), Were to hunt, and, whenever they found, To strangle that vermin reform! ‘Now trace him in administration: Take a peep at his pretty vagaries— His rare engines for calming the nation— Messieurs Reeves and mild Governor Aris! ‘Of kindness so full, the sweet saint; So ready some comfort to give us; When we open'd our mouths with complaint, His gaols open'd theirs to receive us! ‘Next at Newgate behold the great man! Sad scene of sad-ir-recollection— Where tongues with much liberty ran, And dealt in most saucy reflection. ‘What a pity that mem'ry should fail— Great pity, indeed!—I repeat it, That a yesterday's action or tale, To day, one should cleanly forget it!— ‘What a day of dire mortification! What a day of proud triumph for foes! How nimbly the gem reputation Was going, that day, to the crows! ‘Mister Sly says his hero was poor, Which a deal to his glory redounds— If the huntsman was lean, we are sure The lean Nimrod well fatten'd his hounds! ‘Mister Sly says his hero, so pure, Never courted the smiles of the ladies— Sweet Joseph! not woman allure!— What a comical sort of a blade 'tis! ‘That Pitt from the ladies should fly, Is rather an odd sort of whim; But I never should wonder, not I, If the women all scamper'd from him! ‘From his credit, I scorn'd to detract, For candour I always revere— And if Fame ever mention'd one act; 'Twas in whispers no mortal could hear! ‘Civil list, sir, 's a dangerous affair: On this head he had better been mum; Wisdom looks on that list with a stare!— But no more on that subject, sir—hum! ‘Great man!’ said the great Mister Drake— Whose virtues and talents surprise! Not of wretched mortality's make; But sent us, express from the skies!— ‘If P? was sent down from on high, The world, in opinion, must join; And pronounce, with one voice, that the sky, Like Houndsditch, pass'd counterfeit coin!’ T. S. AN INSTRUCTIVE EPISTLE TO JOHN PERRING, ESQ. Lord Mayor of London; On the Proposal of an Address of Thanks to the Right Hon. Henry Addington, FOR His great and upright Conduct when Prime Minister. —Justum et tenacem propositi virum. HOR. Sublime, who sacred holds his word; Lov'd by the Virtues, Wisdom, Wit; By Freedom's friends caress'd, ador'd— Muse, send this character to Pitt! Believe the bard, my good lord may'r, That we have been upon the stare, For your address, for just administration; Which brought the premier so much fame, With peerless lustre crown'd his name, And spread a smile of pleasure o'er the nation! Wild Expectation, on her toe, Has been a month, at least, I know, Looking for this fair tribute of your thanks. Perchance some dæmon, secret, sly, Has mark'd th' affair with jealous eye, And, deep in dark intrigue, been playing pranks: Some Pittite, mad, vindictive, crost, Because the statue has been lost, Has tamper'd with some aldermen, I fear; And, men of common-council greeting, In sad unguarded hour of eating, Mix'd ministerial poison with their beer. Poor iron dust, through playful fate Attracted by the magnet-state! Or let us rather call them straws— Whirl'd from their dirt, their native sphere, By sudden gusts—aloft, here, there— Of babes the wonder and applause!— I've seen that dæmon's cloven foot; In spite of mobbing, damning hoot, The daring imp has learn'd to stand his ground; Well steel'd his heart, and bronz'd his face, He cocks his nose upon disgrace, And hunts his game—a persevering hound. And now, lord may'r, I shall suppose, That Addington's invet'rate foes Impede this honest scheme of thine. Then take this minikin of mine. ADDRESS To the Right Hon. Henry Addington. YOUR good, your mild administration— An epoch in this happy nation— Our grateful thanks demands: And let us here express our grief, That Fate, at times an artful thief, Should tear you from our hands. Though dæmons may in league unite To blur thy star's illustrious light, That brightens now the age; Lo! Hist'ry, with her golden pen, To give thy name to future men, Shall fill with thee her page. Oh, may the men, who seize thy place, Their country's glory ne'er disgrace, By little, base, intriguing arts! Instead of conqu'ring by their crimes, Our sacred liberties and limbs, Subdue, by noble deeds, our hearts! Something like this, lord may'r, I want; This is no parasitic cant— Thou know'st of Addington the merit: Let Calumny her venom spit, And Envy hiss,—and tools of Pitt Employ their cruel coal-black spirit. Without disguise, that Pitt I hate, Despise his mind, and parrot prate; His minions!—with disdain I see 'em!— And would the king (my wish devout!) Make all the motley pack turn out, I'd seek Saint Paul's, and sing Te Deum! DEAR Perring, we are Devonshire-born, Where Plenty fills her golden horn— And, whether sober, sir, or mellow, Old Devon certainly contains, Now, as of yore, some splendid brains, And many a brave and honest fellow. Then let us not disgrace her name, But give her star a brighter flame— Exalt, if possible, her credit; Yes!—boldly act, and write, and think, And mind!—my horn's last drop of ink, To raise her glory—lo, I'll shed it. Thy planet led thee to the east, To fill with precious gems thy chest, And eke with precious ointment: Mine westward order'd me to roam, And, after years, come loaded home With sterling disappointment! And yet I'm not a broken spirit; The public has observ'd my merit, As well as India thine; To which kind public, low I bow— Its candour and its taste allow; For gratitude is mine. Now to the point—Exert thy might, And separate the day from night;— Discern good friends from foes; For thou hast brethren, dark and deep— Amid thy flock, some scabby sheep, Aye, many a one, God knows! Yet should an alderman demur, Strait strip him of his gown and fur— That gown of vivid scarlet! And should the counsel dare refuse To sign th' Address—stain'd be the blues Of every gravy-gulping varlet. I fear that linen-draper's Mr. Waithman, a great city orator, a son of Liberty and Opposition, and elève of John Wilkes, of volcano immortality; who, from his great and cheap shop in Bridge-street, Black-Friars, facing the noble monument called Obelisk, raised and dedicated to his glorious patron, draws patriotic inspiration for his motions and speeches. jaw, Which gives to liv'rymen the law— Forsaking trade, in hour most evil, Lawn, cotton, dimity, and muslin, The pates of common-council puzzling— Has lately play'd the very devil! Of such—O, may the sav'ry haunch Ne'er enter the unhallow'd paunch; Great rival of a bag: Before their mouths, may brawn advance, And turtles fat, and turbots dance, And balk each well-worn snag! Down their plump cheeks, may custards stream— Rich trifle, syllabubs, ice-cream; And may they writhe and grin, And spread their tantaliz'd poor chops, To catch the luscious sugar'd drops— And not one drop get in! Nay, more! may giants of Guildhall, Whom mortals, Gog and Magog call, Leap down on ev'ry head, When next they meet on Lord Mayor's Day, Their vows to Gluttony to pay, And crush each sconce of lead. Oh! strain each nerve, my good lord may'r— Merit like Addington's is rare— To leave him, what a pity! The thunder of my muse's lays Shall shake Parnassus with his praise, And thou shalt shake the city. THE HORRORS OF BRIBERY; A PENITENTIAL EPISTLE, FROM Philip Hamlin, Tinman, to the Right Honourable Henry Addington, Prime Minister. ? Omnia Romæ Cum pretio ? JUVENAL. Poor Hamlin, hammering in his tin-shop, thought That ministers, like saucepans, might be bought; That courtiers, like a fish-kettle or platter, Were made of very malleable matter. From those hard walls, amidst whose awful round, The ear with horror feels the clanking chain; Where sighs from hollow vaults unpitied sound, And tears of bitterest anguish stream in vain; Where, faint and fasten'd to th' unfeeling floor, The wretch desponding mourns amid his gloom; Expecting Death's dread hand t'unbolt his door, And lead him half alive into the tomb; From those hard walls poor Hamlin pour'd his sighs, Much marv'ling how he came to such a place, And, lifting his two melancholy eyes, Address'd the author of his sad disgrace: ‘An't please your worship, hear me, sir, I pray— Hear me a bit—Lord! Lord! I thort no harm; No more, please God! than of my dying day— I ne'er once thort of making zich a starm. ‘I thort that voakes were brib'd in Lenden too, Az well az in the country—zo thort I; I caan't but zay I look'd confounded blue, To hear the terney-general's grievious cry. ‘Lord! half the corporations, zo I've heard, Look 'pon a bribe no more than bites o'vleas, And zwallow oaths, Lord! not one crume afear'd, Az glibly az they clunk their bread and cheese. ‘I never thort that 'twas a sin or shame; Vor az vor squeamishness I never vound, I caan't zay that I thort myself to blame, That voakes wud quarl way two good thousand pound. ‘I know the last election Plymouth votes, Aye, many, many look'd confounded grum: They thort of zomething vor to buy mun coats, Fath! happy to have got but half the sum. ‘Gert voakes have slipp'd a purse into my hand, Guineas—zometimes 'twas eight and zometimes ten— And zo I thort, with maney at command, To give a dowzer to gert voak agen. ‘And simply thus I thort, that I might do, Lord! never dreaming of a jail, d'ye zee; But thort that az my betters did zo too, It never could be wickedness in me. ‘Zomebody'll have the place, I do suppose— A Plymouth man, I make no sort of doubt; A vote too—but, that God-Almighty knows; I really think that things wull zo turn out. ‘Then why not me?—a tinker, very true. But there's Squire Canning's brother hath a place: He was a crock and kittle-mender too; But had good friends to hoist him from disgrace. ‘I own I wanted wisdom for my guide— Indeed 'twas foolish, out so plain to plump it; And then, methought, so great indeed my pride, 'Twas handsomer to buy a thing than mump it. ‘Lord! sir, I kept a reputable shop; Liv'd well, as any body may suppose: But so disgrac'd, what have I now to hope; My goods will stink in ev'ry body's nose. ‘A Newgate bird liv'th there,’ the voakes will cry, Spit 'pon my goods as they pass by my door; ‘A jailbird!’ will they hoot as they go by, And never buy a spoon or save-all more. ‘Nort else had I to offer, sir, indeed, Had I a vote, 'thad beed another case; Or had the town of Plymouth beed my own, Shure, sir, you shud a had it vor the place. ‘Zoon as old Andrew Hill had slipp'd his breath, My neighbour Tap, the landlord, com'd to me; Says he, ‘Leave tinkering—there's a charming death; Hamlin, an angel of a death!’ quoth he. ‘Zounds! what a noghead and a fool!’ says Tap, ‘To mend old crocks, and candlesticks, and kittles— Thy hammer always going, rap, rap, rap— And all to git, forseth, a bit o' vittels! ‘Thy road is now as plain to wealth, my lad, Plain az from Frankfort-Gate to Plimmoth-Dock, Then mind thy P's and Q's, and daan't be mad, And think no more of kittles or a crock.’ ‘Quoth I, ‘How, neighbour Tap?’—Zo then Tap zed, ‘Thee now mayst git a birth all warm and snug.’ And then he tould me Andrew Hill was dead— Zo he and I together drink'd a mug. ‘Lord! Hamlin,’ quoth a, ‘what a beast thee art, When thou mayst be a gentleman complete; To stand here hammering in a stinking shart, Moiling as black's the dowl with mucks and sweat!’ ‘Zo, sir, 'twas not my fault, your honour zees; 'Twas landlord Tap, you vind, that made me do't: The fellow mus'd me with a hundred lees, And I was fool enough to hearken to't. ‘Hamlin,’ quoth Tap, and wink'd—‘I know gert voak; They be no better than their neighbours, mun: At curts, Lord! Lord! mun, honesty's a joke, Froth leeke my fresh draad beer—Lord! downrert fun. ‘Offer the minister at once the bait, Thou'lt find a gudgeon—zee if I'm not right; Now daan't take squeamish scruples in thy pate: Snap is the word at court—I know he'll bite.’ ‘And zo zays I again to landlord Tap, ‘Art sartain that he's hungry, Tap, and poor?’ ‘Try—sniggle for'n,’ quoth he, ‘I know he'll snap.’ Snap with the devil to't, it is, I'm shore. ‘There's Pitt,’ quoth Tap, ‘as poor az a charch mouze, Without a dish or plate upon his shelf; Trying to git again into the Howze, And make a little zomething for his zelf.’ ‘Zo did I trust to Tap—and, leek a fool, Believ'd the minister was leek a vish; Thort leek a poor weak boy that goesh to school, And leek a blockhead thort to bread my dish. ‘I know mun all,’ quoth Tap, ‘I know mun well— Iss, Hamlin, iss, I know mun well anew: I've had mun at my howze, both gert and smaall— With all their grandeur 'tis a dam queer crew.’ ‘And is it zo?’ zaid I. ‘It is,’ zaid he; ‘I tell thee, Hamlin, no man know'th mun better.’ ‘Then Tap,’ zaid I, in answer to'n, ‘dost zee, I'll do't—I'll zend the chancellor a letter.’ ‘And zo I zet me down at once, and wrote The letter that did give zo much offence; I guess that you can zay it all by rote, Which show'd, I must confess, my want of sense. ‘God know'th my heart, I never thort of harm: Your conscience, Lord! I didn't mean to shock it; Two thousand pound, I thort, wud keep ye warm, Nor thort it was a crime to fill your pocket. ‘'Tis cruel hard for to be put to jail, Vor doing what gert voakes do ev'ry day: I thort I might come down upon the nail, And tern a penny in an honest way. ‘I do assure ye, sir, that I'm a vote— Had many a guinea slipt into my hand; And thort at any time that I might do't, And thort it was the way of all the land. ‘The gert voakes shak'd our hands as blest as grigs, And with King George's image made mun burn. Az gert voak buy us leek a lot of pigs, Why not we buy the gert voak in return? ‘Tap bid me write and gauge the servants all, And bid me try your worship's maid and man; But, leek a blockhead, I forgot it all, And wrote to measter, 'stead of Joan and Jan. ‘I must zay this for Tap, he bid me squint, And zee how things were manag'd in your houze; If covetous leek zome voakes The late Lord Kenyon, of miserable memory, and a present great law lord. in the law, Not only starv'd theirselves, but ev'ry mouze. ‘I've heerd, sir, a fine lady Madam Schwellenberg., zome time dead, Did keep a shop vor titles, and got rich; And sold mun just as bakers sell their bread, Or as a porkman sellth a ham or flitch. ‘Upjump'd Sir Jan, Sir James, Sir George, Sir Will; Up with his star and garters rose my lord: This was the case, I hear, and may be still; And places too she sold, to make a hoard. ‘Now there's Lord Rolle, that I remember well, When simple Mister Rolle—not one crumb more; What mad'n a great lord? Lord! I can tell— 'Twas Pitt, and Devonshire int'rest, to be shore. ‘Lord bless us! I remember that as how He was a simple 'squire, upon my soul! And meen'd, too, that his wife, my lady now, Call'd'n nort else but Janny, Janny Rolle. ‘Now by God's marcy, and your kindness, sir, If ever from this hell It is asserted, and from very respectable authority, that this pathetic elegy was sent to the minister before the sentence took place, and produced a most fortunate peripætia in this Newgate drama. I should escape; From home I shall be zo asham'd to stir, There'll be such talk, and laugh, and grin, and gape! ‘I never now shall have my pretty rambles, Afeard of ev'ry butcher, ev'ry drab; Ne'er go for beef and mutton to the shambles, Nor to the fish-stalls, for a plaice or crab. ‘I ne'er must put my nose upon the Hoe A most delightful walk for the Plymouthians, now totally neglected on account of its comatability beauty., The people's jeers wud give me zuch a shock; And slily by Mill-Prison I must go, To sell my pots and dripping-pans in Dock. ‘The world's too bad, I speak it to their shame; When a man vall'th, the meanest rogue will bang un: Zo with a dog too—give un a bad name, And ev'ry body hath a rope to hang un. ‘Voakes will point at me as I go along; The very boys will hold me by the tail, And crack their jokes, and zing a jeering song, And whoop, ‘Here's Mister Hamlin come from jail!’ ‘I thought of high preferment, I declare; But that, I fear, will never come to pass; That I should be one day our Plymouth mare, But, Lord! my lot's to be a Plymouth ass. ‘Instead of marching proudly through our town, Amidst the town-voakes, all with wondering faces; Deck'd all in scarlet, Lord! a fine fur gown, Just leek a king, behind the silver maces. ‘Lord! Lord! to be confin'd in theese dark place, And have a rope—for zo it may befall! Ah me! it is a very different case Between a room in Newgate, and Guildhall. ‘Shore! sir, I've drink'd your health a hundred times, And never dream'd that you could be uncivil; Have wish'd zome vokes the gallows for their crimes, And wish'd the warhoop fellows to the devil. ‘Indeed, sir, you're a favourite with us, Thort mild and human; yes, indeed you are, But Pitt, and all his dirty gang, we cuss; Though Dock and Plymouth git zo much by war. ‘We hate the Grenville faction, hate mun all, A pack of hungry hounds, just like starvation; That snarl and quarl, and grin, and bark, and bawl, Wanting to burst their guts, upon the nation. ‘I love his majesty—deny't who can? True to his government and ev'ry thing. Whene'er he dyeth, Heaven bless the gentleman! I daan't think we shall git a better king. ‘Now, sir, be please to let a body know, And let me zee the end of all my cares; That if I'm to be hang'd, that I may go, And make my peace with God, and zay my pray'rs.’ Such are the tinman's tuneful sighs, That from his gloomy mansion rise, Something like song from dying swans of old: Then Addington, thy rigour quit, Nor boast the iron heart of P?; But show that thine was form'd in Mercy's mould. Yes, let the culprit be forgiv'n— No actual rape took place, thank Heav'n! He wish'd to buy thine Honour's pure embraces. I own with awkwardness he strove— A country bumpkin in his love— A simple Cymon, 'midst the polish'd Graces. Then smile, and put the bumpkin out of pain, And send him whistling ‘And whistled as he went, for want of thought.’ Cymon and Iphigens. to his shop agen. TRISTIA; OR, THE SORROWS OF PETER. ELEGIES TO THE KING, LORDS GRENVILLE, PETTY, ERSKINE, THE BISHOP OF LONDON, MESSRS. FOX, SHERIDAN, &amp;c. &amp;c. Ploravere suis non respondere favorem Speratum meritis.? HORACE In cold neglect is Genius heard to sigh; And Virtue lifts in vain the languid eye. PROLOGUE. A sage, whose name I don't at present know (And 'tis no mighty matter, I confess), Says, if he wish'd to curse his bitterest foe, How would he do it?—curse him with success. ‘Curse me,’ cries every one who reads my book, ‘If I don't wish that formidable evil: On me, let Fortune ever smiling look, I'll run the risk of going to the Devil.’ I fear I'm one of those, and wish to meet Dame Fortune always smiling—in my pow'r; Adversity one can't with pleasure greet— Too much a cross old maid—so very sour. T'enjoy Life's comforts be my lucky lot: Some let me have, dear Life, however small— ‘A mouse’ (the proverb tells us) ‘in the pot Is always better than no meat at all.’ Few are the treasures that Parnassus yields, Its hills and dales, of very little price, Abounding more in rocks than golden fields; And less in sheep and cows, than rats and mice. The streams of Helicon are deem'd divine, Yet quench not thirst of bards like British ale; Envy must own its founts are vastly fine, Yet poets oft prefer the tubs of Thrale. Poets are ever treading upon stars, Sublimely walking arm in arm with gods, Neglecting thus all sublunary cares— Good solid beef for shadows, songs, and odes. Mild is the mien of Merit—ah! how meek— All diffidence, she looks with downcast eye— A blush, a crimson blush o'erspreads her cheek— And fear of censure gives her soul a sigh. From tumult, far she loves to wander—far— A simple, pensive, silent, thoughtful maid, All lonely shining, like the evening star That sparkles on the solitary shade. She pants not for the splendor of a name, To praise, to flatt'ry, wishing to be deaf; Trembling, she steals herself away from Fame,— A blushing strawb'rry hid beneath a leaf. Sweet though her song, she hopes not to be heard: In groves, the melting softness shuns the light— In secret warbling, like the tuneful bird That, shaded, charms the list'ning ear of night. How timidly she tapp'd at Grandeur's door! Afraid to wound the ear with slightest pain— Where Gruff the porter bade her, with a roar, Go to the Devil with her canting strain. There, Folly rushes with his dirty boots, Tattoos, and nearly thunders down the dwelling, Loaded from Drummond's, Mordecai's, or Coutts', Hark! like his hounds—tempestuous, howling, yelling. Lo, Gruff, his hand for ever on the watch, With many a piece of silver has been crown'd— Proud, a round oath, or friendly damn to catch, ‘Hopes that his honour's well,’ and bows to ground. ‘Where dwells this blushful beauty of our isle?’ Exclaims the world—‘this Merit, let us see,’ That world (an unbelieving Jew) will smile, When I inform him, that she dwells with me. Yes, let me own I've nurs'd the infant Hope; Expecting presents from the Lord's anointed— ‘Bless'd is the man who nought expects,’ says Pope, For, lo, that man shall not be disappointed. ELEGY TO THE KING. The Poet informs his Majesty of a Rumour of great things having been done for him at Court, and of his awkward Situation in Consequence of that Rumour arising from the teazing Visits of Friends and Creditors; and supplicates his Majesty's gracious Attention to the Subject, and to relieve his Anxiety. O King! the wondrous changes in the state Engage these curious eyes of mine, to see If Madam Fortune means to change my fate; That is, if ministers have thought of me. Soon as the post arrives, I seize the papers; As much for place my appetite is whetted— In vain! and then I fall into the vapours, And think it hard my name is not gazetted. Friends have pour'd in—‘Ah! Peter, my old boy! The old jade Fortune has been kind at last— Joy! joy!—Pindaricus—we give thee joy— Well, well, the loaves and fishes come at last.’ In vain I tell them, that 'tis no such thing, And represent it as an idle rumour:— ‘Poh! Peter, thou art joking, our good king Forgives a jest, and loves a bit of humour.’ ‘Sirs! what d'ye mean? I've nought, upon my soul’— ‘What! not a hint? no message? ah! no letter? Soon shall we hear thy coach's thunder roll— Credat Judæus! Peter, we know better!’ The mad ex-courtiers cry, ‘thou old black sheep, Thy rhiming sins will never be forgiv'n: In peace in this world ne'er expect to sleep; Nay more, expect not to make peace with Heav'n!’ Bonfires have also blaz'd, lit up by people, Whose patience, almost lost, for years has tarried; The bells too, nearly cracking the old steeple, Pealing as though the poet were just married. The marrow-bones and cleavers have been here, To pay a compliment upon my pension: ‘Ah! butchers,’ I have whisper'd in their ear, ‘Fudge! downright fudge! mere humbug—sheer invention.’ The cook too, with his petit soupé bills, For some dear Lais, fond of pretty picking; Who, fair as Hebe, just like Hebe fills, So fond of oyster sauce and a broild chicken. The pot-boy soon, and tailor too, I fear, Will pay their court: the barber too, the prig, I make no doubt, will presently appear, Inquiring how I lik'd my last new wig. And, ah! the cobbler too has sought my room, To compliment the poet and his muse, Quite dissipated all his former gloom, With smiles presenting ‘a small bill for shoes.’ The little robins, seldom seen before, Seem twittering gratulation to the poet; Wagtails and sparrows too, surround my door, Chirp pleasure, and the cocks in concert crow it. Ev'n from its hole, beside my straw-stuff'd bed, A poor starv'd mouse, who hears these sounds of Babel, Pokes forth, with seeming joy, his little head, To spy if any thing is on the table! ‘Poor mouse,’ I sigh, ‘thy face must still be lean, Like mine, since nothing has been done for me: How canst thou, though thy appetite be keen, Expect that something should be done for thee’ Thus has this diabolical report, Plung'd your poor poet in a sea of trouble; Thus have the fancied honours of the court, Deceiv'd and got me in a horrid hobble. Dread sir, your bard's ambition soars not high, To take Pitt's place, or join the privy-council; But yet a warbling goldfinch, such as I, Might peck some hemp-seed—taste a little groundsel. Yes, sire, this mortifies and makes me sad, Pleas'd should I be to meet your high commands; Beyond a doubt I should be vastly glad, To join the royal circles, and kiss hands. Then, sir, permit the bard t'approach the throne, To ask if this intelligence be true; The world proclaims it with the firmest tone, Yet none can tell his fortune sir, like you. ELEGY TO THE SAME. The Poet remarks the Change of Sentiments in favour of three principal Patriots, Fox, Sheridan, and Burdett, &amp;c.—The Poet being one of the Sheep, in the List of the proscribed, wishes his Fleece to be whitened by the Sunshine of a Court-smile, but apprehends that fortunate Epocha to be at some Distance—He hints to his Majesty that he has no Disinclination to accept of something handsome; relates a mortifying Circumstance in the Life of poor Maynard, a French Poet, and mentions the Want of Hospitality in some of the Gentlemen of the Palace. O look at Sheridan, Burdett, and Fox, Such terrors once—such bugbears to the crown; Lo, nothing now in either patriot shocks! The palace marks their forms without a frown! Pages and maids of honour, at their names, No longer pale and trembling keep aloof! Demons no more—their mouths emit no flame— No tails they wear—nor carry horns and hoofs. ‘Heav'ns! Mister Fox is quite a charming man, So placid, and so generous in his nature; And then agen for Mister Sheridan, So lively, clever, Lord! so great a creature. ‘So sensible, indeed—so full of wit, So pleasant, so good-humour'd, sober, mellow; Lord; without meat a fortnight one could sit, To hear him talk—he's such a pleasant fellow. ‘Full of his fun, and always something new, O heav'ns! a nightingale to Pitt the croaker; One, easy, as we say, as an old shoe, The other, stiff and formal as a poker. ‘Then there's Sir Francis! how polite a man, So worthy, and his character so fair is, Pays all his debts! uncommon!—a black swan!— Oons! down with Cold-bath Fields, and down with Aris. ‘So handsome, and so neat as a new pin! So like a gentleman in every feature! Lord! what a shame Mainwaring should come in, A shabby, nasty, black and ugly creature! ‘There—Pitt has kick'd the bucket—what a rout! He made the people many an empty dish; Our party were unwilling to cry out, But no one, to be sure, cries “Stinking fish.” He's dead—and heav'n go with him, where he goes; Poor bees! he robb'd our hives of all the honey! Hard are his taxes, God Almighty knows! Like so much dung, he shovell'd off our money! Yes, Fox and Sheridan, and poor Burdett, Sore frighten'd all the pages, maids, and dames; Put all the cooks and scullions in a sweat! Wolves in their forms, and poison in their names! Poor sheep, by Pitt call'd black, throughout our isle; Poor lambs, that wander'd bleating to and fro, Now, in the sunshine of the royal smile, Behold their fleeces are as white as snow! Oh! would my wool but turn a little white; I too am black, and doom'd to bleat and hunger: ‘No!’ cries my ruling star, ‘thou still must bite The barren rock, and wait a little longer.’ My liege, there are some very pretty places That I could fill, at least that would fill me; One whisper to their lordships or their graces, Would do—I think we should not disagree. ‘Who first an oyster eat’ was a bold dog, So said King Charles, whom hunger seldom vext. But he (say I) who ventured on a hog, Must think of dining on the Devil next! Ah! sharp is hunger—for to feast on air Must make the stomach look confounded blue; I grant those things are formidable fare— What will not teeth t'oblige the stomach do? A poet of great poverty and fame, Maynard, address'd old Richlieu on a day;— ‘My lord, I'm sunk in years, and blind and lame, Ere long the debt of nature doom'd to pay: ‘Soon as I gain the Elysian Fields, the king, Our late good monarch, whom we all must love, Will say, “Monsieur Maynard, what news d'ye bring, What are my subjects doing, pray, above?” ‘Then will I mention the great things I see; Report your deeds, that dazzle ev'ry eye: Now should he ask, sir, what you did for me, What to the king, my lord, must I reply? ‘Reply!’ cried Richlieu, to him, ‘answer nought.’ Oh! what an answer to so great a poet! Thus to disgrace the cardinal was brought, And Hist'ry's blushing page will ever show it. Dread sir, your palace gate I often pass, Kneel at your door at times, and scent your meat; But neither cook nor page comes out, alas! And kindly crieth, ‘Peter, rise and eat.’ ELEGY TO THE SAME. He moralizes on Virtue and Money; mentions the Neglect of celebrated Authors; and triumphs in the Idea of the Honours he should receive from Napoleon, could he be conveyed to Paris, and gives a noble Speech of the Emperor on the Occasion—The Poet concludes with dropping another Hint to his Majesty about Merit and Places, which last he very probably will discover to be purely Utopian. ‘What's virtue, without fortune to support it?’ Says Horace—‘viler than the vilest weed.’ What genius, grant sublime, yet who will court it? The world inquires not who can write or read. But he who gives a splendid ball or rout, Like Thelluson, a breakfast or a dinner; Him, him, the world endeavours to find out; Makes wits of fools, and sanctifies a sinner! The gentle Ovid, whom the graces love, Charm'd with his plaintive lyre the hills of Thrace: No tears could melt, no supplication move; The exile pin'd, and perish'd in disgrace. Yet all the world—one universal cry, Condemns the rancour of the emp'ror's soul; That frown'd, unmov'd by Pity's melting sigh, The abject slave of Passion's proud control. Old Homer: that sublime, immortal name! Poor bard! sung ballads thro' the streets of Greece, To save himself from famine—what a shame; And sold them for one half-penny apiece! Our Milton too, with equal spirit fir'd, No patron found, his talents to requite: And, pining, from a barb'rous world retir'd, Sunk darkling, like the tuneful bird of night. The plaintive Otway perish'd through hard need, While rhiming Dulness batten'd at her ease; And Dryden, on ambrosia form'd to feed, Just like a rat, has din'd on bread and cheese! Much did King Charles our Butler's works admire, Read them and quoted them from morn to night; Yet saw the bard in penury expire, Whose wit had yielded him so much delight. And you, my liege, if Fame the truth report, In reading verses oft employ your leisure; And often, from the tumults of a court, Read certain odes too, with uncommon pleasure. Eternal scandal to this barb'rous age: In piteous penury Savedra pin'd; In piteous penury lay poor Le Sage; Oh! what a stinging satire on mankind. Yet let one action of the day shine forth,— (And Candour loves to dwell upon my tongue), Thurlow could see a Cowper's modest worth, And crown with fair reward his moral song. Dame Fortune never asks me what I wish, Tho' bold my flights, that raise the eyes of kings; They ne'er exclaim, ‘thou wondrous flying fish ‘Amidst our seas of claret wet thy wings.’ O would the angel to my room repair, Who rais'd good Habakkuk, and lift my crown (No matter by the wig or by the hair), And then in Paris gently set me down; Soon at my lodgings would arrive a card, From him, whose deeds a world with wonder fill; ‘The emp'ror's compliments—requests the bard Would eat his mutton with him en famille.’ Then as the bottle jovially we push, The Gallic Alexander roars with spirit, ‘Great Monsieur Peter, I shall beat the bush, For some nice place to crown your matchless merit.’ Then will he say to Monsieur Talleyrand, ‘I honour genius, and of bard the name; So take this charming poet by the hand, And cover yon ungrateful isle with shame.’ Behold me then on Fortune's wheel, in short, High fix'd, a seeming hero of romance! Kiss'd by the ladies of Napoleon's court, And visited by all the wits of France! Such is the picture Fancy loves to paint; A scene, perhaps, that sober Wisdom scorns. Sick is my soul! with disappointment faint,— ‘Curs'd cows,’ reports the proverb, ‘have short horns.’ Tell not in Gath nor Askelon such things, And furnish Scandal's tongue with defamation; No! let her never cry, ‘the best of kings ‘Neglected the best poet of his nation.’ Pleas'd, on his tombstone, couldst thou read these words? ‘Here lies the bard of humour, wit, and whim, Who, though he sweetly smil'd on earth's great lords, Did ne'er bestow a single smile on him.’ ELEGY TO LORD GRENVILLE. The Poet accuses the Delusions of Hope, who had promised him a Number of good Things; sings with much Pathos of the Treasury, and a Stranger called Money; and concludes with a handsome Compliment to Lord Grenville, hoping for the Honour of his lordship's Acquaintance. Hope whisper'd that my market would be made, If one day Pitt should go upon his travels; Lo! Pitt is off, yet Fortune lags, a jade,— This, please your lordship, the poor poet gravels. Hope whisper'd me that Calumny's black breath Would cease, and that the howling imp would die; Yet, in the winds I hear the fiend of death,— This steals a sorrow from your poet's eye. Hope flatter'd—but her pleasure is to cheat, She loves to chouse the feeble-sighted mole; Her mansion forms the idiot's last retreat, Her glittering beams the moonshine of the soul. O Grenville! who hast felt the furious storm, And bellowing thunders of the gloomy main; Trac'd too with boldness, Danger's giant form, In port, at anchor, thou art snug again. While now, amid thy fleet, with tow'ring pride, Safe moor'd, secure from rocks, and winds, and fog; Admit my little cutter along side, And ask its master to a glass of grog. The Treasury's golden door to many a man Opes wide! ah! shut on me, the bright abode; These shoes have tramp'd from Beersheba to Dan, Nor found a small brass farthing on the road. A guinea's lovely face I never see, Though strong my passion, wishing to be billing; Ev'n little sixpence prudish is to me, And coyer too her elder sister, shilling. With thee the beggar is no longer poor, The blackest sinner whitewash'd soon and sainted, Regeneration then within thy door; Oh! what a pity, we are not acquainted! ELEGY TO LORD H. PETTY. The Poet addresseth Lord H. Petty on those important Objects called Meat and Drink; disclaims the Vanities of Ambition, his highest being to sing in a snug Corner and eat. O Petty! of whose talents, virtues—Fame Is with a trumpet pleas'd to talk a deal; O listen if thou lov'st a poet's name, To what concerns a poet much—a meal. To me has Nature bountifully giv'n A handsome stomach and discerning palate: Forgetting to complete my earthly heav'n, To put a little something in my wallet. I wish not to be minister—not I; I put not up my prayers for Petty's place; Nor Fox, nor Sheridan produce a sigh; To Ireland goes unenvied Bedford's Grace. Too often Fortune, on her cloud-capp'd tow'r, Shall place a gentleman, and then, uncivil, Shall bid the thunder roar, and torrents pour, And wash and blow his honours to the D?v?l. Survey gude Melville and his gude friend Trotter, Who drove the world before them in high glee! Amphibious Melville! yes, a kind of otter, That liv'd on flesh and fish by land and sea. Be somewhat mine, but far from bustling men, In stillness be the gentle poet blest! In secret solitude a humble wren, To hop and peck, and twitter near my nest. Form'd with œconomy, in Wisdom's school, What government may give I will not squander; And imitate the Prodigal, the fool, Eat grains in hog-sties, and a vagrant wander. The gay Hilario liv'd in style—in state; A palace for his mansion—din'd with dukes; Enjoy'd his carpets, sofas, pictures, plate, Dogs, horses, music, mistresses, and cooks. Pale Envy mark'd with wishful eye the scene— How long? ah! soon did Fortune turn her back, Revok'd her smiles, and show'd an alter'd mien, Refusing farthings where she gave a lack. Behold him meagre, wan, in mean attire, Doom'd ever, in a prison's cell, to pine; Now cooking, at a little hungry fire, A pound of tainted mutton on a twine! Much should I like to see a joint of meat, Instead of one poor solitary chop; Afford my friends, at times, a little treat, The fiddler call, and give their heels a hop. My mansion too, I would enlarge, I own, Increase my tables, knives and forks, and pottery; Now this, my lord, could easily be done, Would Fortune ask me to attend the lottery. One word from Petty makes the goddess kind, Which thus a pretty little place secures: My lord, though to my merits always blind, Her eyes were open'd to discover yours. ELEGY TO LORD SIDMOUTH. The Poet exhibits a Sort of Claim on Lord Sidmouth's Attentions, founded on the various and dangerous Battles he fought in Support of his Administration: he freely acknowledges his Smile on his Lordship's prudery, that resisted with so much Violence the Bribe of the silly unthinking Manufacturer.—He gives a pathetic History of the Tinman's declining Health, his Swan-like Soliloquy before his Death, his Epitaph; and makes up all Matters with Lord Sidmouth by a small Sarcasm on his own Muse, and a handsome Compliment to the noble Lord. O Sidmouth! alias Addington, on high, I mark thee basking in the royal smile, Where honours thick as hops, and pensions lie, That spread a lustre o'er our happy isle. So high in favour, and so near the throne, Say, canst thou not, by ways and means, contrive To gratify a harmless, humming drone With some small honey from the court's huge hive? Oft have I dwelt with pleasure on thy name, And fought thy battles in the wars of wit; And oft, the tuneful stentor of thy fame, I took thy part against the Janus Pitt. Now charg'd with ode, the muse with much renown, Has fir'd from newspapers a deadly gun, Knock'd many an imp of opposition down, Now with a red-hot satire, now a pun. Such are the services perform'd with spirit; Then ponder on the labours of the muse; Think of a something to reward her merit— The dame would thank thee for a pair of shoes. Hark! hark! I hear the voice of hundreds cry, ‘Thy muse has covered him with ridicule;’ This allegation let me not deny; But Sidmouth should have smil'd upon the fool. Muse, on the Tinman let us drop a tear, And breathe a gentle sigh upon his fate; Who took to heart his destiny severe, And never after made a spoon or plate. Ne'er solder'd stew-pan, sauce-pan, or a kettle: Made not extinguisher, nor pair of snuffers; In short, ne'er meddled with one bit of metal— So much a wounded delicacy suffers! 'Lone in his parlour, just behind his shop, Poor man! in solitude he sat and sigh'd; Tears from his eyes, like peas, were seen to drop, When thus, in sorrow sunk, the tinman cried:— ‘Farewell my dripping-pans, tin-jacks, farewell! Skimmers, and syringes, and toasting-forks, Tin pint and shaving-pot, and scallop-shell, Farewell my shop, with all its shining works! ‘Farewell my hopes that whisper'd a fur gown, That to the windows brings all Plymouth faces; No may'r! in glory to parade the town, Before my aldermen,—behind my maces. ‘Since Newgate held me, I am lost, forlorn; My strength decays, in speech I daily falter, Hourly I wish I never had been born, For every thing around me smells of halter!’ Thus mourn'd the man of tin, and spoke no more: I saw him carried to the churchyard's gloom; I sought his grave at evening's stilly hour, And sympathising—thus inscrib'd his tomb: ‘Here lies a tinman, who to wisdom lost, Tried hard to bribe a minister of state; Who knew not, when a man obtains a post, That all the virtues on his worship wait. ‘Poor man! he knew not that the great were good, Inflexible, in honour vastly nice; That virtue ever mingled with high blood; That lofty lords, like cobblers, have their price.’ Yes, Sidmouth, though thy talents I admir'd, And lov'd thy virtues, thou couldst not escape; By laughing subjects is the muse inspir'd, And mine's a little saucy, grinning ape. And where is all the mighty harm, I wonder! What is it all, when all is said and done? The bard, to kill a midge-fly, pours a thunder, And spares no blemish, though 'tis in the sun. ELEGY TO LORD ERSKINE. The Poet addresses a just Eulogium to the Lord Chancellor—He thinks that he has taken now and then a poetical Liberty with a certain Peer of the Realm; also with the modest and disinterested Mr. George Rose—recites a Speech of the exalted Earl of Liverpool; and complains of the false Opinions of the World, concerning him. O Erskine! on whose head, whose blameless head, The muse of eloquence has plac'd her crown; Where Malice has her venom vainly shed, And Envy, the foul fiend, has fix'd her frown. Such is thine honour's fairness, a pure snow; And such thy talents as must charm a nation: Blest change! the cygnet for the croaking crow, Long-wish'd amends for one late elevation. Though far from courts, a culprit in disgrace, In dreary solitude my merits shine; Though near a throne, I dare not show my face, I'm glad to see the monarch smile on thine. I think I've call'd Lord C?????a f???, And were I king, that lord should be displac'd; Heav'ns! can the liver of a saint be cool, When such on Fortune's pinnacle are plac'd? I own I never could expect George Rose, Wishing him captain's clerk or purser still; Not roll in treasure, which God only knows, An ocean roaring from a creeping rill. ‘Hoot!’ cries old Liverpool, ‘ye rhiming rogue, Ye mun na laugh at people of high station; Ye that have neither stocking, shoe, nor brogue, Yur lugs should suffer for yer defamation. ‘Ye thenk becaze yer head has some wee brain, And thenk becaze that ye can speel yer letters; That ye may show'r your squebs as theck as rain, And take domn'd leeberties wee all yer betters.’ Rave on! no trophies I to Dullness raise, Too proud, though poor, to call foul weather fair, Proclaim a dirty cloud the solar blaze, And substance yield to castles in the air. Full oft I laugh (to burst with rage is vain) To see what false ideas mortals form; A cloud of darkness drear they paint my brain, With thunder, lightning stuff'd, and floods and storm. Ah! more like Luna from her eastern bow'r, That issues forth in radiant robe array'd, Steals sadness from the solitary hour, And gilds the horrors of the midnight shade. Or, sweet Arcadian nymph, whose smiles adorn, Some region that in savages delights; Or lark, the little syren of the morn, 'Midst magpies, owls, and jays, and screaming kites. ELEGY. [Yet not alone is poetry despis'd] The Poet sympathizes with the disgraced State of Knighthood at Windsor; and gives the Conversation that took place in St. George's Chapel at Midnight, between a Pair of noble Spectres. Yet not alone is poetry despis'd, The noble knighthood also feel disgraces; At scornful Windsor, is the order priz'd? The knights, poor fellows, blush to show their faces! Where is the spirit of our ancient sires? Tares flourish, where should grow the golden wheat? Instead of glory, grovelling gain inspires: How rarely merit and preferment meet. Where are the noble military knights, In Windsor's sacred stalls that ought to shine! Men, for their country that have bled in fights, And, glorious, cast a lustre on their line? Alas! the men who now the honours gain, Provoke from sober justice e'en a laugh; Lo! by those heroes, sheep are only slain, Geese, turkeys, rabbits, or a hog, or calf. There was a time when Honour was in fashion; There was a time when Glory was ador'd; When Merit was the idol of a nation; When Valour edg'd the fury of the sword. Knights who ne'er kill'd a foe, except a flea, Whom garter, mantle, waving, plumes adorn; Poor knights of Windsor with disdain survey, Look down upon them with the squint of scorn! 'Twas at the midnight hour, when walk the dead, Saint George met Edward in the sacred fane; When thus the saint bespoke the king—‘Ah! Ned, Alas! poor Honour now is in her wane.’ ‘Dear George, 'tis very true,’ replied the king, ‘Poor Honour is just come upon the parish; Merit may tramp the streets, and ballads sing: My new-made knights can boast of nothing warrish. ‘Shall Stitch, the cross-legg'd rascal, to this fane Hop from his board and hell to be a knight; Th' immortal glory of the order stain; What! to the lordly lion mount a mite? ‘Shall Harry Haunch, Dick Duck, and Toby Pigtail, Be knights, because his lordship cannot pay 'em? Sam Sledge, Bob Boots, Ben Broadcloth, and Will Wigtail, Because his debts are such he can't defray 'em? ‘O must Tom Turbot, Tart, and Matthew Mustard, Enjoy the lofty honours of the stall? And on that cream-fac'd animal, Kit Custard, The glories of an installation fall? ‘On market days, alas! how dread the sound, From butcher knights, a most disgraceful cry— Beef, mutton, fourpence farthing, ma'am, a pound; Nice pork, ma'am; veal, ma'am; pray, ma'am, what d'ye buy?’ ‘Ere long the brazen barrow drab, Bet Bundle, Shall come and bully with her bill, my lord; Bet ceases in a trice, her wheel to trundle, To kneel beneath the splendors of the sword.’ Now crow'd the cock, the eye of orient day, Peep'd on the noble ghosts, each other greeting: ‘B'ye, Ned, I'll give,’ St. George was heard to say, ‘The hist'ry of my knights at our next meeting.’ ELEGY TO J. DONITHORNE, ESQ. The Poet, in a Series of happy and illustrative Comparisons, bewails the Cruelty of his Fate. Heav'ns! what a world we live in! oh! how sad! To this thy long experience will agree— Half fill'd with fools—be-devil'd, drunk, or mad— How blest, dear Donithorne, were all like thee! Patient as men upon the river's side, Who for a dinner throw the worm or fly, So patient I Preferment's fish have ey'd, But cannot hook one, or to boil or fry. Patient as hunters in an eastern wind, Ungracious wind! for running hares unfit; I seek Preferment's hare, but cannot find— In perfect stillness sleeps the rusty spit! The smiles of kings, who court the trump of fame, No little partialities should know; On merit, wheresoe'er it springs, the same, Like heav'n's kind showers on ev'ry plant that flow. Or like the sun's bright orb that beams on all, Disdaining winds and elemental strife, Bids on the lane's poor pool its kisses fall, And bids it, like the ocean, teem with life. Patient as blushing virgins of sixteen, Whose ears have heard a lover's piteous prayer; If those same lovers are not constant seen, Or, faithless, mean to fly to other fair; Patient as widows in their mournful weeds, When no kind second husband comes to sigh, Or heir, that cannot to th' estate succeed, Because his father chooses not to die. Patient as cats before the mouse's hole, Winking and nurs'd with sanguine hope the while, To nab the little animal, poor soul! These eyes have sharply mous'd for Fortune's smile. ELEGY. [While others sink in seas of rosy wine] The Poet complains of the unequal Distributions of Fortune; of the Countenance given by the Great to a vile Catgut-scraper and Canvass-dauber, in Preference to the sublime Bard; and concludes with a beautiful Apostrophe to his Divinity, Independence. While others sink in seas of rosy wine, Where rosy Pitt resign'd his housing breath; No drowning oceans of the grape are mine— I can't afford to put myself to death. While others, stuffing, chok'd on dainty fare, Like London aldermen undaunted die; To Heav'n with turtle in their mouths repair— I can't afford to choke myself—not I! I cannot make a larder of my throat; Nor of my stomach form a purple well; Good claret by the sight alone, I note, And judge of ven'son only by the smell. Now on a bench I ponder in the Park, Near some frail nymph as hungry, beauteous sinner! And now, alone, voracious as a shark, Dream of a feast, or count the trees for dinner. Behold the catgut-scraper with his crowd, Commands at will the house of hospitality, Sits by the peer, not Lucifer more proud, And hobs or nobs it with the man of quality. And now, behold a bellowing calf knocks in, He thunders, and no porter dares oppose— Jokes with his lordship, fills himself to chin, Where the poor poet dares not show his nose. Behold the canvass-dauber, he can draw My lady's cat's-face, or her pug, or parrot, Shall range at large the mansion, and give law,— But where's the modest poet?—in his garret! Such is the bard's sad fate of modern days, To gain Life's comforts by his art, unable— A man despis'd! the long-ear'd beast that brays, Finds in his manger a superior table. O! Independence, to thy name I kneel! Yes, with idolatry I bend the knee; If aught of pride, aspiring pride, I feel, Sweet nymph of freedom, 'tis to live with thee. Then sorrow never would my heart invade; Then let us in some rural mansion dwell; Content will join us there, the simple maid, And to a little heav'n convert our cell. Content gives freshness to the fields of air, With every sweet the breath of Zephyr fills; Can make our common viands dainty fare, And yield a flavour to the fountain's rills. Thus will we pass in silent ease the day, Each hour shall carry sunshine on its wings; Nor envy Salisb'ry's glory at the play, Five hours a stake behind the chair of kings. ELEGY. [Too poor am I, alas! to pay for praise] He bewails the World's Want of Candour and Discernment in hearkening to one of the Rivington Reviewers, and paltry Paragraph Spinner, to his (the Poet's) Disadvantage. Too poor am I, alas! to pay for praise; I cannot visit a reviewer's shop: And well I know how much a dinner sways! A pot of porter and a mutton chop. To gaunt reviewers, paragraph inditers, Each trembling door is ever open found; Who dares affront such formidable writers? Snakes, whose sharp fangs inflict a mortal wound! Puff call'd on Daub one morning—‘My dear fellow, How much improv'd in colouring and grace! So chaste the contour, and the tints so mellow; Not thou, but Titian, finish'd up that face! ‘To these, are Raphael, Titian, feeble souls; Daub, o'er the town its merits shall be spread!’ ‘Dear Puff, wife waits with coffee and hot rolls,’ Puff, like a bull-dog, breakfasts on the head. Just before dinner Puff pops in agen— ‘Daub, I must see the progress of thy art; O, like thy glowing pencil were my pen! 'Sblood! all alive—the figure makes one start. ‘Exhibit Daub—success is sure—don't doubt it; The charming piece will ravish all beholders— Springs from the canvass—murders all about it!’ Thus dineth Puff upon the neck and shoulders. ‘Daub, what a gem! the finish I must see, With not one flaw, with lustre so replete:’ Thus Puff upon the body drinks his tea, And makes a supper on the hands and feet. Yet not alone on Daub he plays his art, The play'rs too must contribute, beg, and bow: Or woe to Romeo's, woe to Juliet's part— He like a lubber dies, and she a sow. The singers too must humble, must come down, Or, lo! the pen destroys them at a stroke: ‘Bad—shocking stuff—an insult on the town, Crack'd, out of tune the voice, the raven's croak.’ Poor Tweedledum must also taxes pay, Must bend to Puff, or woe to Tweedledum! ‘The fellow has no bow, no tone—he play!— Zounds! to the dancing dogs unfit to strum.’ But Puff possesses still a wider sphere; For Puff the advertising taylor stitches; A scrap of Latin wins the public ear, And gives to Puff a handsome coat and breeches. The man of pork who wishes for a name, Approaches with a joint, or dainty chop; His hogs at once a laurel gain from Fame, And, lo! all London crowds to Griskin's shop. Has Block the barber got a son and heir, Puff pens a paragraph as quick as thought; ‘Quite well the lady and the child appear;’ Puff joins the christ'ning, and gets shav'd for nought. Is Crispin married? Fame must tell the town; Puff hails th' event, informs the world the news: Behold perfection the fair lady crown; Puff gets his bridecake, and a pair of shoes! Is Mistress Tripe the butcher's lady dead? Out flames a paragraph of pretty penship; ‘Resign'd and pious tears in plenty shed, By all that had the honour of her friendship. ‘She left three children to lament her fate, And worthy Mister Tripe to join their grief:’ Rich laud!—in gratitude to Puff! the plate Receives a handsome tribute of roast beef! Yet more than this can Puff, ah! happy Puff; In fate, how much superior to the bard! Besides, this fellow calls my poems stuff; Though form'd by labour hard, ah! very hard. Shield sets my song, and Incledon may sing; But if the pen of Puff shall chance to damn it, Alas! how little will the ballad bring! Too soon the grocer's spice and sugar cram it. ELEGY TO MR. FOX. The Poet addresses Mr. Fox and Poverty in a tender and pathetic Strain, and accuses the late Minister of a most infamous Duplicity. O Fox! thy talents Envy's self must own— I saw not all thine actions with a smile; In days of yore my face confess'd a frown, Some acts indeed disturb'd the muse's bile. The hours of youth are light—those hours are past; But truce!—a sweet forgiveness shall be mine; A summer sun is sometimes overcast— Well pleas'd, I see thee now with lustre shine. If right I guess—if Fame reporteth true, Who very often deals in downright fibs; Fortune has made thee look a little blue, And of some pounds of fat has robb'd thy ribs. Thou then wilt pity a poor brother bard, As courtiers call'd me, ‘an old rhiming sinner;’ Who playing, with such want of skill, my card, I cannot get a herring for my dinner. Amid the scramble for the loaves and fishes, Ye gods! I fear me, I am come too late— Such legs and noble sirloins in the dishes, 'Tis hard that I should find an empty plate. Like Belisarius have I fought and bled, Attack'd the tyrant Pitt with all my art; What my reward? a bludgeon on the head, Whips on my back, and daggers through my heart. Pitt's hungry blood-hounds constant watch'd my walk, When, like the babe, sweet innocence was I; In coffee-houses listen'd to my talk, And forg'd, to blast my fame, the treason'd lie. What gave that Pitt, that patriot Pitt, his pow'r, For which old Chatham taught his heart to hanker; Ask R?d, Cartwright, who in evil hour, Join'd their dark counsels at the Crown and Anchor. To fire and sword the flaming patriot flew, To cut down all the plants of opposition; Plants from his own infernal seed that grew, Nurs'd in the hothouse of his own sedition. Rewards and statues, now the r???? requir'd To give to immortality his name— With d?n'd combustibles the house he fir'd, Then sought our thanks, for putting out the flame. Ah! Charles, amid the toil for loaves and fishes, I see no change of colour in my fate; Though full my heart of thee, and warm its wishes, Not one my stomach fills, or warms my plate. Go, for I'm pleas'd to see old Nic as soon; Go, Poverty, and never see me more: Who takest knife and fork, and dish and spoon, And turn'st the sad inhabitant to door. Thy hag-like form and melancholy tones, Sharp nose, and pale cold cheek, and beamless eye; And shrivell'd skin that scarcely veils thy bones, Spreads terror o'er my soul and wakes the sigh. 'Tis said, that thou some years ago wert seen With Rose and Jenkinson, on Scotia's plain; Then leave, O! leave me with thy haggard mien, And visit Rose and Jenkinson again. ELEGY. [Fond of the marvellous are mortals all!] The Poet confesses his utter dislike of Pitt's Administration; describes his own uncommon Intrepidity, and relates an apposite Story of a Brother Bard and a rhiming King of Sicily. Fond of the marvellous are mortals all! And love sublimely of themselves to talk:— From Paul's church-yard, upon the dome of Paul, I ne'er could see a fly, nor hear him walk. Yet some have wondrous ears and wondrous eyes! Drake, ere he came, beheld his idol Pitt; Beheld his angel form amid the skies, And heard his wisdom, eloquence, and wit! Too oft Credulity entraps the soul! She lies in wait for Idiotism and youth— List'neth to tales baptized rigmarol, And makes them pass for oracles of truth. What thousands thought, with marv'ling Master Drake, That Billy Pitt descended from the skies— I own I stood not staring like a stake— Pitt blaz'd no meteor on the poet's eyes. Yes, I detested Pitt and all his measures, And wrote Will-ippies on administration, For treating just like dirt the public treasures, And forcing to the workhouse a great nation. Pitt swore he'd hang me—order'd out his thieves To seize the gentle poet by the throat! But, lo! the poet laugh'd at Mister Reeves— Still with Will-ippics swell'd his daily note. ‘Thy measures are all vile,’ I boldly said; Then vow'd he horrid penalty and pain: ‘Thy measures are all bad, all bad, all bad!’ Fearless of punishment, I roar'd again. A certain king of Sicily made verses— Sends for the poet laureat, Mister Bays— Bays enters, and the rhiming king rehearses— Expecting from his poet peals of praise. Deeming them gems from the Parnassian mines— ‘Well, how d'ye like my verses, Mister Bays?’ ‘Bad lines,’quoth Bays, ‘most execrable lines; I never heard such stuff in all my days.’ Black look'd the tyrant—but pursued his rhimes— ‘Well! now what think ye?’—‘Worse, my liege, and worse! Don't publish them, O king! and damn the times!’ Then Bays's taste the king began to curse. The disappointed monarch, in a rage, Loud by his crown and by his sceptre swore, If thus he judg'd, he'd put him in a cage, Or chain him all his life-time to the oar. The king read on—but, ah! in vain he read— The same untuneful lines, the same dull sallies— ‘Speak now, Bays!’—the poor poet shook his head— ‘Worse still, and worse?oons! send me to the gallies!’ ELEGY TO MR. SHERIDAN. He compliments Mr. Sheridan, confesses that he has been a Literary Reviewer, but of the most consummate Candour—he complains of the Illiberality of Mankind; condemns literary Impostures, and wonders at the Want of Discrimination in the World, which so often mistakes a trifling Capacity, with a little Schoolboy Learning, for Genius. O Sheridan! amidst thy walks of wit, Success has crown'd thee—ev'ry Muse has smil'd; While Peter, thanks to dullness and to Pitt, Finds Pindus a most melancholy wild; Oft am I term'd a niggard of applause; And that I do not justice to the times: Alas! the world complains without a cause: Display the virtue, and I'll find the rhimes. I own I've squeez'd some miserable souls, And made them of their folly somewhat sick; Show'd to a grinning world their phiz, like moles 'Midst fields they ravag'd, in a cloven stick. I own (with candour too) that I review'd— Unstain'd like Rivington's black tribes, my tongue; Merit, with tomahawks I ne'er pursu'd, Spar'd hooting owls, and kill'd the birds of song. I spar'd not puppies, though they bore a star; I spar'd not blockheads, though they wore lawn sleeves; On vile impostors rush'd my angry war, Rogues in saints' masks, and literary thieves. A hound, mute hound, in cold contempt they call me, That never to fair merit gave my tongue; With ev'ry weapon of offence they maul me, Poor Orpheus! 'midst the Bacchanalian throng. Much have I suffer'd, and my Lady Muse— Bullets, like hailstones, pelting at our head— From mud-forts fir'd, call'd Rivington's Reviews, Ah me! incessant show'rs of brass and lead. Where, cloth'd, well fed, warm quarters, handsome pay Enough to put old Satan in a sweat— Four Parsons, hir'd like Swiss, to wound and slay, Are peeping, aiming, from the parapet. Muse, tell their names, at whom Religion stares, Like scavengers that labour in the kennel— Maurice and Beloe, all-devouring Nares, And supple, fawning, crawling Parson R?l! O Genius! thou fair flow'r of rich perfume, What stinking weeds have stole thy sacred name; Display'd their tawdry colours, for thy bloom, Till blushing Folly's self has cried out ‘shame!’ Possess'd of mem'ry, Nature's gift to fools, Thus coxcombs read and learn the thoughts of others; And swell'd with lexicons and grammar rules, Scare with Greek-thunder their old aunts and mothers. Of such I could a manufact'ry make— With such sad things the groaning world encumber; From town and country any orders take, And send, at shortest notice, any number. Grosses of Rennels I could quickly send, Of cobbler Giffords, and such cobbling fellows— Of Fus'lies, numbers, numbers, without end! Thousands of Nares, and Maurices, and Beloes. O Sheridan! once more to thee I turn; Say, is there nothing that my taste would hit? In vain I fear me for the gift I mourn; Lo! every wit would kill a brother wit. Thus, when two clouds of fire sublimely meet, Immediately are heard most serious matters; The gloomy foes in sounds of thunder greet, And, rushing, tear each other into tatters. ELEGY. [By courts I'm call'd a dev'lish saucy fellow] He complains of the abusive Language of the Courts, and of the Hostility of Lord Puzzle the Lawyer towards him—gives a Portrait of Old Puzzle ad vivum. By courts I'm call'd a dev'lish saucy fellow; The monkeys chatter, and the tigers growl! The calves of quality, offended, bellow; The hounds of calumny with fury howl. Lord Puzzle wish'd, alas! with horrid jaws, The pretty lamb of poetry to kill! For what enormity of crime! because I sought the Muse's mount, to taste its rill. Most lustily indeed Old Puzzle swore, I roam'd a demon, and would eat the state; And that my bleatings were the lion's roar; That Ellenborough's club should give me fate. Perchance the muse has smil'd on poor Old Puzzle; For poor Old Puzzle is conceited, proud: 'Tis hard indeed the Muse's mouth to muzzle, While others at Old Puzzle laugh so loud. I dare not Puzzle praise in verse or prose, Puzzle, the dark'ning ink-fish of the law; His mud of doubts around, unsparing throws, And of a fly's foot makes a tiger's paw. Yet this deciding, undeciding man, Contriv'd that Fame should stuff him in her trumpet; But Fame, what Pity! since the world began, Has oft been found a fawning, lying strumpet Heav'n keep me from Old Puzzle and his court, Full of wig wisdom in his solemn hour; Full of deep doubts—and ev'n of clerks the sport— Uncertain if that two and two make four! To mention him with Bacon, or with Hyde, Would make poor Hist'ry sick—we won't say vomit; Heav'ns! what a tarnish on her page of pride! A feeble, winking rushlight, and a comet! ELEGY TO NARCISSA. He confesses the Folly of his Youth in pursuing Fortune, who never could be induced to notice him—her Daughter, however, Miss Fortune, was of easy Access, or rather too importunate, addressing him even at the Hazard of his Life. The Poet recollects past Times and Narcissa, with a sigh; and even in the Autumn of his Days, would dare whisper soft Things in her Ear would Dame Fortune with a few kind Looks prove favourable to his Wishes. When youth was mine, I envied Fortune's store; With envy gaz'd upon her splendid dome; Knock'd, with assurance, at the lady's door, And, though I saw her—‘nobody at home!’ My thoughts by day, by night my happy dreams; To Afric's roasting climates did I roam; I sought her mansion near the golden streams, And knock'd (poor Peter!) ‘nobody at home!’ Still went I on, where great Columbus found her, 'Midst thunder, tempests, and the ocean's foam— Saw on her isle a thousand slaves surround her— Again I knock'd, but ‘nobody at home.’ ‘Ungrateful dame,’ I cried, ‘not see the bard, The Philomel of Britain's polish'd isle? Not see the poet who has toil'd so hard, To gain adm'ssion for a single smile?’ Griev'd to the soul, to London I return'd, And set me down in Duke's Street, Portland Place; In sackcloth and in ashes there I mourn'd, And curs'd my star that kept me from her Grace. Yet, though the mother I could never greet, Her daughter wish'd to see me and my books— Miss Fortune—oft I saw her in the street With Bow-street runners—men of horrid looks. The damsel swore she lov'd me and my wit! 'Twas difficult to keep the girl in check; For, lo! near Newgate, in the reign of Pitt, Rudely she strove to hug me round the neck. Like Captain Potiphar's bold wife of yore, Who seiz'd the gentle Joseph, she provok'd me; And had I not display'd a giant's pow'r, I verily believe the jade had chok'd me. Yet for myself I wish'd not wealth alone— For thee, Narcissa, was the wish, in part; I thought thy beauties once would be my own— And sigh'd to give thee more than my poor heart. With thee I hop'd to live in rural ease, Far from the tumults of the world withdrawn, Where health would meet us with her fragrant breeze, Lead to the hills, and join us on the lawn: Now prune the vine, and now the various tree, With pleasure view the blossoms of perfume, Now in the blushing fruit (and cull'd for thee), Behold the tempting rivals of thy bloom. With thee to tread the dews at early day, And meet young morning on the orient hill; Pleas'd, as the brooks in murmurs wind away, And learn some moral lesson from the rill. With thee I hop'd, in Summer's golden hour, To wander, arm in arm, the glade along; To touch the lyre of love amid the bow'r— And thou the blushing subject of the song. When Winter ravag'd in his stormy rage, With thee I hop'd t'enjoy the cheerful fire; With thee converse, or read th' instructive page Or mingle with thy sweeter voice the lyre. Now for the tuneful tenants of the grove, That sue for pity, strew with grain the ground; Poor beggars, the sweet objects of thy love, That flocking chirp their gratitude around. With thee I wish'd to raise the tender flow'r, And in thy presence dig the grateful soil; With thee the nursing rill, Narcissa, pour, And deck at last thy bosom with my toil. And when, at midnight, through the vast of shade, The tempest whelm'd the world with wild alarms; Then to my bosom press a timid maid, And lose its thunder in Narcissa's arms. Such were my wishes! yet thou still art fair; And I, though lost some blushes of my cheek, By Time's rude hand, would Fortune grant my pray'r, With Love's sweet whispers, would thy cottage seek. But grant that beauty were no longer thine— Narcissa's converse would the hours beguile— Ev'n in old age would happiness be mine; Time leaves a treasure if he leaves thy smile. ELEGY TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON. The Poet supplicates his Brother Poet, the good Bishop of London, and one of the great Guardians of the British Museum, to dislodge the Parsons that are got into that Dwelling, thinking it more in Character for a pious Divine to attend rather to the Souls of his Parishioners, than to lousy Birds, Quadrupeds, and musty Manuscripts; and supplicates for himself the Post of a Curator. O Porteus! hear a poet's humble pray'r; For Porteus, thou hast been a poet too Of yore—like me of golden trappings bare— Like me, with scarce a stocking or a shoe. No friends have I, alas! on Fortune's wheel; No patron kind to help me at a pinch: But happier thou! when wanting a good meal, Sweet smil'd upon thee Lady Charlotte F????. Sweet were the smiles, indeed of Lady Charlotte; For, lo! 'twas she as all the world believes, So good, so chaste (abhorrent of the harlot), Who heard thy pray'r, and gave thee thy lawn sleeves. Say, Porteus (for thou ought'st to love a poet), Why can't I get to Montague's great house? As well as can thy parsons, I can show it, And keep from nits the elephant or mouse. Three parsons now are keeping cock and hen: From preying worms, the weasel and the rat; The tribe of ostrich, and the tribe of wren— The tribe of goose and cuckoo—tribe of gnat! Moths in old books, and parchments too they scout, Though great the toil! and hundreds worth a year— This arm, I trust, can put them to the rout— With equal fire attack their front and rear. An't please your lordship, well I know the art Of snatching from perdition fish and fowl— Can bid mortality from snakes depart; Preserve a crocodile, and stuff an owl. As brave as Maurice, brave as parson Nares, These hands the leathern forts of moth can storm; And, sharp as sportsmen, foxes chase and hares: Through all his various winding hunt the worm. Then pray now send each parson to his parish, Where Sin the cradle of each infant rocks; And since with nitty tribes so wondrous warrish, O bid them slay the maggots of their flocks! ELEGY. [Who is that form, which cometh cloth'd in light!] The Poet is addressed by the Goddess Wisdom, who reads his Fortune, very severe and very disheartening, but nevertheless administers good Counsel. Who is that form, which cometh cloth'd in light! With step of speechless grace and front sublime! Whose eye can pierce Futurity's deep night, And view the shadowy scenes of distant Time? Immortal Wisdom! hear her voice divine! ‘O Peter! I respect thy tuneful rage; I quote thee oft, and many a golden line Instructs, illumines, and adorns my page. ‘Know too my pupils all thy odes rehearse, And dwell with constant rapture on thy name; Yet will foul Slander's venom seek thy verse, Pale Envy's fang too fasten on thy fame. ‘But, lo! the cedar on the hills that tow'rs Must face the storm and meet the lightning's stroke; The drone will buzz around the fairest flow'rs— The caterpillar crawls on ev'ry oak. ‘The royal eagle in his airy sweep, By rooks and crows is pester'd beyond measure; And, lo! the mighty monarch of the deep Too often feels the sword-fish and the thresher. ‘Sweet are the melodies that leave thy lyre! Rich in invention, fancy, fire, and spirit; Yet know, though Taste and Genius may admire, Nor place nor pension will reward their merit! ‘High on Parnassus, thou canst claim a seat; A sure election! yet, O man of sorrow! If mortal-like thy mind be fix'd on meat; Go, keep a vote-shop in a Cornish borough.’ ELEGY TO CYNTHIA. He marvels at the unfair Representations of the World in regard to his Muse, and candidly avows a stronger Penchant for Praise and the tender Passion, than for Satire. What are my dire offences, what my crimes, That I can never, never be forgiv'n? It seems as if all Hell was in my rhimes; Shut on my nose each avenue to Heaven! No rude, no savage satirist am I; Arm'd with a sledge to knock poor Folly down, A gentle biting blister I apply! And with a gliding razor shave her crown. I rush not on the world with scorpion whips— Beneath their fury none are heard to screech; Touch'd by my toe alone a culprit skips; Shoe-leather application to his breech. Yet, hark! they all are crying, ‘Murther! murther! A Turk, a Saracen is come among us! No massacre was ever carried further— His weapons scalp and flea, and stab and prong us.’ How dreaded, though of courtesy the pink, Mercy and I walk arm in arm together! Such are the horrors at a drop of ink! Such are the clamours at a goose's feather! Smiles at court follies are a venial thing; That I have laugh'd at times is very true; Laugh'd at the lordly minions of a king, Lord Owl, Lord Vulture, and the Lord knows who. But, ah! how happier, happier far the hours Of Love and Cynthia that indulge the dream— Then, then her song the muse with rapture pours, When Beauty and the Virtues are the theme. But, Cynthia, dear variety invites— In quest of this, the muse at times will stray; And though thy converse and thy bloom delights, Perpetual roses must not strew her way. ELEGY TO THE BEE. He most pathetically addresses the Bee, on the Ingratitude of the World towards him; and prophesies of himself a Fate equally cruel. Sweet labourer! midst the summer's golden hour, Full oft I trace thy little busy flight— With pleasure see thee perch from flow'r to flow'r; On violets, woodbines, roses, lilies light. Yet what to thee is summer's golden smile? And what to thee the flow'r-enamell'd plain? Will gratitude reward thy daily toil?— No! no! thou workest for reward in vain. Not long the hive of treasure will be thine— Rapacity will force thy little door: Those treasures with thy life must thou resign, A breathless victim on the fragrant store. O base return! to lose thy precious breath— And I, ye gods! as basely shall be serv'd; Thou for thy treasure wilt be smok'd to death— And I the honey'd poet shall be starv'd. ELEGY TO SCOTLAND. He drops a Tear for the supposed Death of Simplicity; but, recollecting himself, finds her alive and in good Health at the Seat of the Duke Roxburgh. Dead is Simplicity! long dead! ah me! Of yore, hard work'd Earl Thomas and his spouse— Earl Thomas sweating in the field, while she Help'd Nan the dairymaid, and milk'd her cows. No sparkling jewels held my lady's neck fast; No silks embrac'd her bosom and her crupper; Beer and salt herrings form'd her simple breakfast; Her dinner beef, and bread and cheese her supper. Coaches were scarcely known, and if they had one, 'Twas for conveniency toward the weather— Not gilt and varnished! no, a very sad one— A poor alliance between wood and leather! Then was the minstrel's harp with rapture heard; The song of ancient days gave huge delight; With pleasure too did wag the minstrels beard, For Plenty courted him to drink and bite. The poet now no longer is carest; Sweet bird, he hops and flutters to and fro! With ragged plumage, and without a nest, Half starv'd, he sings in Pater-noster Row. Of yore, our gentry held not honour cheap; A man would hang the head that left a jail; How like a pointer that has chok'd a sheep, And steals off with a squint, and drops his tail. The earth, with terror cloth'd, the bailiff trod! Like Jove, th' important fellow walk'd the land; His awful voice, the thunder of the god; Jove's sceptre the dread tipstaff in his hand. No more he frightens—now the man of debt, With philosophic calmness walks the town; No more a scarecrow, Newgate starts a sweat, Despis'd his ruffian grasp and mock'd his frown! Yet let the muse be candid—Fame reports That sweet Simplicity in Scotia reigns; That many a man of birth the minstrel courts, With bacon feeds, and stuffs with peas and beans. Thrice happy Scotia, blest by Ossian's birth, And grac'd by her The Duchess of Roxburgh. who every heart allures; Invite me to that pleasant spot of earth, And happy let me touch the lyre at Fleurs! I heed not Johnson's sarcasms of rude thunder, Who trod a greeting soil, yet scorn'd to thank it— Where was the genius of the land, I wonder, It did not toss the cynic in a blanket. ELEGY. [Urganda, if a favourite cat lies in] He continues to wish that he had been so happy as to have been a Vote in a Cornish Borough; and, with Tears in his Eyes, enumerates the Pleasures and Honours he has lost. Urganda, if a favourite cat lies in, Invites her friends to caudle and rich cake: But when my muse is brought to bed, no din, No how d'ye visits my cool neighbours make! Or is the monkey sick, he takes his bed, Old Slop is sent for to prescribe for Pug— Complains the muse on what shall rest her head? What soul will send a pillow or a rug? O had I been a vote, a borough vote! Then Fortune would have squeez'd me by the hand; Then would my back have worn a different coat— Shirts, stockings, shoes, had been at my command. Then with his lofty lordship I had din'd With other votes, a numerous band at table; Had drank his health, receiv'd his smiles so kind, 'Midst clattering knives and forks, and sounds of Babel. Then had I mark'd the wonders of his face, Gap'd at his speech and swallow'd ev'ry word; Then had I got the promise of a place— For promises are frequent with a lord. Then had I touch'd his lordship's hand or cuff, And measur'd him all over, inch by inch; Mark'd how his lordship gracefully took snuff, And possibly been honour'd with a pinch! Then had I heard of boys the joyous yells— To praise the Lord, the cannon's loud endeavour, And guns of marrow-bones, and jingling bells, Mix'd with sublime huzzas, ‘My lord for ever!’ Then with his lordship I had march'd the town, With may'r and aldermen, a pompous band— To enter the votes' houses up and down, And seen him shake Tom Stirrup by the hand. And now Ben Block the barber, now Sam Sledge, Now Stitch the tailor, now the mason Shovel; Old Scrape the scavenger, the woodman Wedge; In short, each happy wight that own'd a hovel. Then had I seen the lord and grannies greet, Seen the old dames their mouths for kisses wipe— Heard the loud smacks of busses, all so sweet, And seen his lordship smoke their stumps of pipe! Then had I seen his lordship to his chaise; Take leave, with may'r and aldermen, in sorrow; Hop'd weather would be fine, and good the ways, And that he soon again would bless the borough. No matter who the bidders—all's the same; The man that hard for Cloacina An old electioneering lady, known in Cornwall by the name of the Dame of the West—the fair subject of many a pleasant song. labours, With gold is welcome to the good old dame— Ship-brokers, or ship-breakers, or ship-swabbers. ELEGY TO MR. ROWLANDSON. The Poet wishes for the Pencil of Rowlandson to make an Exhibition of the Rivingtons' Reviewing Parsons. Ah! Rowlandson, in vain are all my toils; The muse's ordeal the vile priests despise; In vain she roasts them, carbonades, and broils; The spit and gridiron the dark band defies. O did I boast thy pencil's happy pow'r! Parnassus should the black impostors show; High on a pill'ry should the culprits tow'r— And make wry faces to the mob below. There, while their ears sore writhe beneath the nail, And each poor piteous priest for mercy begs, With tune Apollo should those ears regale— And all the Muses send them rotten eggs. While, sad below Hypocrisy should mourn The British Critic, dropping from her hand Its leaden leaves, by taste and genius torn, Old Aristarchus should survey the band. Smiles on his cheek, and pleasure in his eye, To see the imprison'd heads with horror stare, ‘Lo!’ (pointing with contempt) the sage will cry, ‘The foes of learning who have stol'n my chair.’ ELEGY TO A FRIEND. The Poet describes his small Library, and the cheap Manner of obtaining the Lucubrations of it, the ingenious Authors of whom he speaks of with all the Reverence due to their Merits, and expresses a Hope of enlarging his Collection by the Assistance of Hucksters, Grocers, Porksellers, &amp;c., well known Encouragers of modern Literature. Small is the poet's library, God knows, Small is the praise, the candid bard can utter: Leaves of light wisdom! but in scraps it flows, Instructing, and in fond embrace with butter. Subscribing to a chandler's shop for cheese, I gain the labours of celestial thought— Sermons of Nares my eye with wonder sees, And reads his British Critic all for nought. But now, in higher walk t'employ his time, Behold our Aristarchus, Parson Nares, Steals ev'ry day an hour from prose and rhime, To wait on snakes, stuff'd monkeys, owls and hares. Far from his parish, and the toil of praying, Far from the drudgery of soul-salvation, To save old Egypt's mummies fast decaying— The precious stink and treasure of the nation. To save the bird's nest, butterfly and bat, The tribe of squirrel, and the tribe of mouse; The race of weasel, and the race of rat, Whose glories grace of Montague the house: Where Maurice too and Beloe, grave divines, Fled from soul-slavery—what an easy fate— Make new antiquities and new old lines, And pension'd show the toy-shop of the state. Yes, sir, my library is rather small— In comes Matthias, hugging many a slop; And Parson Rennel from the huckster's stall— And kissing sugar from the grocer's shop. And, lo! the labours too of Mister Knight, Leaves fond of fish and oft with mustard taken; Leaves that in candles also take delight, A chop of mutton and a slice of bacon. Soon too I'm promis'd Mister Fuseli's work, His Shakespeare, Milton, by the man of pickles; Discourses—also by the man of pork; The labours of the wonderful John Nichols. And now, embracing sugar, christ'ned brown, Leaves from the works of Cobbler Gifford's Muse Stepp'd from her stall, at Ashburton, to town, Where oft she whistled to old boots and shoes. Ere long, the huckster promises me more; Lives of the brother Rivingtons—great men! Great traders in the literary lore— Encouragers of paper, ink and pen. In Paul's Church-yard, the Bible and the Key, This wondrous pair is always to be seen— Somewhat the worse for wear—a little grey, One like a saint, and one with Cæsar's mien. Fat are the hounds of Rivingtons' known pack, Fat on the ven'son of the nation's park— Much like the devil's hell hounds too, and black, And hunt, like them, their victims in the dark. ELEGY. [In days of yore, the golden days of rhime] The Poet remarks the different Treatment of Bards of the present, and that of past Ages; and complains of not meeting as much Encouragement for his Verses as Organ Grinders, Exhibitors of Bears, Camels, dancing Dogs, and Punch. In days of yore, the golden days of rhime, The mighty monarch to his minstrel bow'd; But what is now the character, sublime? A blind old ballad singer and his crowd! Kings too were poets—David to his lyre Sung sweetest elegy—and David's son Sung to the harp with all his father's fire, And all the virgins of Judea won. And thou, Isaiah, too didst deal in song; Born, let me say, a gentleman, and bred In satire, let me tell thee, rather strong, That broke the Babylonian monarch's head. Had I said half as bad of George the Third, As thou of Babylon's imperious king; My fate had been far different, take my word— My just reward, the pill'ry or the string! The organ-grinding girl, whose discords kill, Is beckon'd by our dames of highest quality; And grist she gaineth to her screaming mill— And court'sying, thanks them for their hospitality. To me no lover of the Muses cries, ‘Out with thy wallet—let us hear thy odes— Then George's image shall delight thine eyes— Behold a sixpence for the song of Gods.’ No nymph of quality on Peter calls; No Lesbia fond of sparrows and the dove; And bid me make them melting madrigals, And say, ‘Sweet Peter, sing us songs of love!’ The man who carries punch about the street, His scolding wife, the baker, and the devil; With fair rewards from all spectators meet, And to his poverty each purse is civil. The man who leads his camel up and down, Where sports a grinning monkey on his hump; Dines princely, such the favour of the town, And never mourns like me in doleful dump. The man who leads about a dancing bear, Or dancing dogs, good living never lack, While I, who lead the Muses (fate severe!) Can neither treat my belly nor my back. The clowns of thirty pounds a year (no more) Laugh at the sons of song, and scornful pass us; ‘One little rood of dirty land,’ they roar, ‘Is worth a thousand acres of Parnassus.’ ELEGY TO MR. R. GOUGH. The Poet addresses Mr. Richard Gough, the Enfield Antiquarian, on the Subject of the Arrival of a Couple of invaluable Curiosities from Egypt, but of whose Nature our British Antiquarians seem totally ignorant. He predicts a future Batch of Invaluables for our National Museum; and concludes with a Wish that Mr. Gough would contrive to keep the three Parsons awake, who are the grand Curators of the Contents of our British Ark. O Richard Gough! amid thy Enfield dwelling; Now o'er a mummy's precious leg or loin, Devoutly tasting and devoutly smelling, Now licking an old dish and now a coin;— O Richard! amidst locks and rusty nails, Now blinking o'er old farthings, blue and green: And trumpery, that every month regales The readers of the Gemman's Magazine;— Why keepest thou from London far away, While various wonders of the Nile approach! O! come and view a treasure then, and say, ‘What greets our eyes—a scorpion or cock roach?’ And haste to view another wonder, Gough, With rapture are the virtuosi giddy— Fam'd Alexander's coffin, or a trough For Egypt's pigs, or Cleopatra's biddy. To meet each marvel, Antiquarian haste, Proclaim its quality, that none may doubt it; With rich sagacity of smell and taste, To London come, and tell us all about it. Sir Joseph and his virtuoso friends, Stun with their loud rejoicings, our Museum; Archbishop, bishop to the wonder bends, And mean, 'tis said, to order a Te Deum. Old Nilus writes us, he will search his flood, And send us his drown'd rarities with pleasure; Probe ev'ry hole, and shovel up his mud, To load our happy isle with tons of treasure. I see, I see arrive from Egypt's lands, Gods of old times, and godlins, green and blue; Ribs of its ancient kings, and legs, and hands, To ravish all the lovers of virtu. Precious, through time, I view a vermin vile, That crawl'd on Pharaoh's back—the very louse; And eke the little croaker of the Nile, The very frog that hopp'd about his house. Fingers of Lady Potiphar of note, Which fix'd on Joseph to her charms to bind him; And, lo! an actual rag of that torn coat Which, struggling, modest Joseph left behind him. Come too, and shake the parsons from their snore During the profound and mid-day sleep of the three divine curators of the British Museum, many of the most valuable articles in the same dormitory, taking advantage of this comfortable nap, contrived lately to make their escape; so that, if a proper person be not appointed with a flapper, to keep their eyes open, the three Levites will soon be the only remaining curiosities of Montague House., Or snakes, and toads, and weasels steal from sight; The moths and butterflies will wing to door, And owls, and bats, and eagles take their flight. ELEGY. [Blest were the days when gold was yet unknown] He mourns at the Discovery of Gold, as a Demon of Destruction, expresses modest Wishes, and pays a small but just Tribute of Applause to our amiable Princesses. Blest were the days when gold was yet unknown; The man who drew it from the secret earth, Forc'd from its bosom an eternal groan, And, luckless, gave a fatal demon birth. The burning soil of Afric I have trod, And seen the shining mischief in the sands— Then, sighing, said, ‘Behold the world's vain God, Our Baal, that rank idolatry commands!’ And golden Mexico these eyes have seen, And from the splendid wonder turn'd aside, Where Vanity extends her boundless reign, And loads the shrines of Luxury and Pride. I sigh not for a waggon load of gold; For wild Ambition never fir'd my wishes; Some modest little place I hope to hold, And taste a morsel of the loaves and fishes. Who court the glittering gems of Fortune's mine, Court frequent ruin—thus upon the thorn, The spider spins by night his silken line, That catch, and break beneath the drops of morn. I hate not courts, and all that courts contain, A thousand beauties may to courts belong; Lo! George's daughters have inspir'd my strain, Sweet subjects also of some future song. I mark not Grandeur with an envious eye; But, when those nymphs of merit I behold, I own I see their virtues with a sigh, And envy them their goodness, not their gold. A bleating lamb, for verdant hill and vale, Alas! I wish to leave my barren rock! A cooing dove, that tells his plaintive tale, To build a nest amid the great state oak. Or ev'n a spider on the cloud-capp'd tree, I wish to weave, for wand'ring flies my net; Nay, a poor pismire—smaller can I be? Run on its ribs, and pick my daily meat. I never wish'd to pull a monarch down, Nor close in hard fraternal hugs, not I; Th' equality I sought was, near the crown, To hob or nob in sack, with Mister Pye. ELEGY TO A FRIEND. The Poet mentions a Part of the Furniture of his Room—grieves that he was never married—supplicates the Vengeance of Venus on the mercenary Beauty—compliments his own Merit, and makes no Doubt of an exalted Situation in the Temple of Fame. Alas! I boast not Fortune's glittering heap, Few are the decorations of my room— Hung with some tapestry, indeed, but cheap, The gratis labours of the spider's loom. Too poor, I never could afford a wife— Ye gods! of all misfortunes, most distressing; My stars refused that comfort of man's life, Deeming the prize, perhaps, too great a blessing. For many a Phillis did I pen the song— Knelt to her beauty, with most saint-like eyes; In vain my verse, in vain my wooing tongue The venal fair one wanted more than sighs. Must beauty be an article of trade? Like cherries must the balmy lip be sold? The soft and swelling bosom of the maid, Just like a rabbit's skin be giv'n for gold! Forbid it, Venus! from the venal fair Snatch ev'ry charm—to hay convert her locks; Pug up her nose, and pug-like make her stare, And pit her pimpled visage with small pox. Red make her eyes, and turn her teeth to jet; For balm, O! taint her breath with rotten eggs; Corkscrew her shape, and elephant her feet— Raise a high hump, and give two tankard legs. And if she seek for public praise by song And novel writing, sink her to the dirt— O! be for ever out of tune her tongue, And may the novel ev'n disgrace Dame Flirt. Such be the punishment of nymphs who sell (What love and love alone should bless) their charms; Then billet doux, and sighing swains farewell, The eye's fond dotage and the soul's alarms. Merit and I, sad exiles, hand in hand, Just like the children in the wood, poor worms, Unnotic'd, crawl a most ungrateful land; Save by sharp hunger and the howling storms! Yet will some comfort to our souls remain! When Time shall tear our frames—each beam and rafter— Though here, for this world's good, we sing in vain, Our songs with glory will be crown'd hereafter. Why with the milder virtues was I born, 'Midst a rude world, where Vice is in her bloom! Why with a heart, by tempests to be torn, Lin'd with the tender cygnet's softest plume? Amid those scenes of villany and art, Where havoc, murder, depredation dwell— Instead of such a softly feather'd heart— A rugged grinding stone had done as well. While Pope and Churchill, with envenom'd rage, Attack the vice and folly of our isle, No war, envenom'd, with the world I wage; Sweet Pity sighs, or yields perhaps a smile. The man who brings into the world a mind, With milk of human kindness beyond measure— Will, in himself, with small reflection, find, He brought to this our world, a world of treasure. ELEGY TO THE BAT. The Poet addresses the Bat with much Acrimony; discovers a strong Similarity of Feature in Bat's Face and the Faces of Rivingtons' Critics—he, however, acquits Bat, but condemns their pampered literary Mohawks. Day's golden orb has sunk beneath the skies, And silence steals upon the world of shade: The little playful humming host of flies, With gambols wild, the fields of air invade. Vile Imp of darkness! from thy dirty hole, I see thee start in wickedness away, Fierce as a mighty lord of the control, With harmless insects making horrid fray. In thine I mark the phiz of Parson Nares, The cynic features of ill-nature fill it, Who, when young Genius his light wing prepares, Leaps from the shop of Rivington to kill it. In thine too I behold the phiz of Beloe, Poor rhiming priest, and eke the phiz of Rennell, Sad wights, and eke that limping cobbling fellow, Lab'rers in Defamation's filthy kennel. For where is one of Rivingtons' Reviews, Like eastern winds, that doth not cast a blight; That does not try to murder ev'ry muse, And cloud her merits with oblivious night? Yet, little imp of horror, I forgive Thy depredation on the insect host: Thou crackest all their tiny bones to live, And bats must eat, though lives of flies be lost. But, lo! the cobbler and the pamper'd priest, For luxury their scrawling pens employ; Abuse supplies them with a monthly feast; The palate prompts their poison to destroy. In vain for praise is Candour heard to pray; Beg on fair Merit smiles of commendation: Tush! havoc is the order of the day; Critics, like demons, thrive upon damnation. ELEGY. [The world seems tir'd (the idiot) with good things!] The Poet condemns the present general Taste, and foretels the Return of the Ages of Barbarism. The world seems tir'd (the idiot) with good things! Adieu! adieu! to all that is sublime! Disgusted Taste for flight prepares her wings, And curses Music, Playing, Paint, and Rhime. Barbaric ages shall again return; The Goth and Vandal now are on the way; Ev'n now I hear the voice of Wisdom mourn, As darkness blots the beams of orient day. O say, was Phœbus and each Muse asleep, When Master Betty murder'd Shakespeare's page? Or when Miss Mudie, by her lofty leap, Shook off her leading-strings to lead the age? Where was the Muse of poetry to suffer? Pig-boys to quit their troughs to print bombast; And tempt poor Wyndham too to be their puffer, Who gravely tells us Thomson is surpast? And where wert thou, O goddess of the brush? On whom the voice of Taste in thunder calls; That to th' Academy thou didst not rush, And dash the daubs of Dulness from the walls. Or where wert thou, O goddess of the fiddle? To suffer Air to join with Goosy Gander, Cock Robin, Horner, and High-diddle diddle; And turn a tuneful prostituted pander. O Muse of Eloquence! how canst thou bear Poor Canning's voice, that humbly apes thine art? Vast is the difference to the judging ear— Heav'n's awful thunder to a brewer's cart! And, nymph of Sculpture too, the bard demands, How thou, with patience, with uncursing breath, Couldst see Saint Paul, by hard unhallow'd hands, Ston'd, ston'd, poor saint, a second time to death? In vain I preach—in vain in scorn I smile— In vain my pen the giant Vice assails; Herculean labour to reclaim an isle, Where Rapture dotes on Mother Hubbard's Tales. ELEGY. THE SPEECH OF PRUDENCE. ‘Too much of freedom in thy stanza dwells, A free-thinker and free-speaker is thy muse,’ Prim Prudence cries, who keeps a shop and sells, With one sweet smile to Christians and to Jews. ‘Truth is a dangerous acquaintance, mind— Struck by her voice, the world is in alarm,’ Continues Prudence, ‘go and Flattery find, Thine idol, goddess, does a deal of harm. ‘In days of yore, when first thy song began, How suppliant thou didst beg one laurel sprig! So full of meek humility the man; One little leaf to stick about his wig; ‘But soon as Fame a civil word bestow'd, Puss show'd her tail—of daring, what display! Out rush'd thy Pegasus upon the road, Heels up! and kick'd down all that cross'd his way! ‘How ting'd with blushes was thy muse's morn! Tones in the minor key, so sweet—so under; The linnet's melting warble from the thorn, Soon chang'd to fury, tempest, flame, and thunder. ‘Thy wanton hawk each fearful bird pursued— How couldst thou laugh at bishops and reviewers? Thus, in their anger, wert thou barbecued; Their stake thy body pierc'd, thine eyes their skewers. ‘With lawless fury didst thou drive thy car, O'er hill and dale, indeed without a fear— Vainly thou deem'dst thyself a man of war: Reviewers deem thee a poor privateer. ‘Ah! Peter thou hast made the court thy foe— Thy persecution then can be no riddle; It hates to caper to thy tune, I know, And wish'd a thousand times to break thy fiddle. ‘Most dangerous is th' attempt at reformation— Why to the people wilt thou tell their sins? Ev'n let the boobies work their own salvation; Why push into their consciences thy pins? ‘The bard who begs his alms from door to door, Must never dare expose the fool or cheat; The rhimer should remember he is poor— Parnassus dealeth more in air than meat. ‘Dread is the satirist! a name of fear! Beast of a thousand heads! a horrid creature! The world's afraid to see him, or come near! Noli me tangere in ev'ry feature! ‘How couldst thou dream of mocking courts of kings? Of laughing at the fav'rites of a throne? Cutting of quality, the stars and strings? And tying, dog-like, to their tails, a bone? ‘By Reason's curb thy mouth has never bled: Go, wear it, bear it—use will make thee able; And if a truth must get into thy head, Know knaves and blockheads keep the nicest table. ‘Woe to the foolish man, and fit for nought, Who cannot shut his eyes against the light! Woe to the man that dares to speak his thought; And woe to him who swears not black is white.’ I own that I have suffer'd for opinion: A liberty of thought was ever mine: My soul abhorr'd Hypocrisy's dominion; And scorn'd to yield for pelf a golden line. Well then—since poets, though divine, must munch, Dame Prudence, songs of praise shall store my wallet— Here—waiter, bring me a beef-steak and punch— Conscience, go make thy humble bow to Palate. Stars, garters, ribbons, reds and greens and blues, Enjoy your splendor—be with flatt'ry fed— Ev'n Br?d?l's self shall smile upon the muse, And find to gold and silver chang'd, his lead! Breakfasts and dinners, routs and masquerades; Lo! crown'd with garlands, ye shall pass along— Apollo's self, with all th' Aonian maids, Shall join the jovial crew with harp and song. And weeping ladies, should a lap-dog die, His mem'ry shall not want the tuneful shell; And should a breathless monkey want a sigh, The bard has praises and a sigh to sell. TO BELLA. Ah! tell me not that I am old, And bid me quit the billing dove; Though many years have o'er me roll'd, My heart is still alive to love. Then tell me not that I am old. When Beauty's blush delights no more, And Beauty's smile and sparkling eye; When these no longer I adore, Then Pity yield the bard a sigh. I will not quarrel to be told, Son of Apollo, thou art old. ON THE DEATH OF A CELEBRATED MUSICIAN. Adieu to the song of the grove! Our Philomel warbles no more! The loss of his carols of love, The shepherds will ever deplore. And sweet to the nymphs of the vale Were his lays—what delight on the ear! Whenever he melted the gale, How the virgins would hasten to hear! Where is Echo, so fond of his voice, So pleas'd on each accent to dwell? Poor Echo no more will rejoice! But silently sleep in his cell. Though doom'd from the world to depart, From remembrance he cannot remove; While tenderness reigns in the heart, For his song was the language of love. Though sever'd by Death from our plains, Thou charmest no longer the sphere: Sweet warbler! thy spirit remains, For thy carols will live in our ear! LINES TO LORD NELSON, With his Lordship's Night-cap, that caught Fire on the Poet's Head at a Candle, as he was reading in Bed at Merton. Take your night-cap again, my good lord, I desire, For I wish not to keep it a minute; What belongs to a Nelson, where'er there's a fire, Is sure to be instantly in it. TO CHLOE. Ah! tell me not that I grow old, That love but ill becomes my tongue; Chloe, by me, thou ne'er wert told, Sweet damsel! that thou wert too young. A SONG. The smile of the maid I adore, I have sought, but have sought it in vain; Hope, lull me with flatt'ry no more— Fate dooms me to sigh and complain. When she meets me, the radiance of morn Breaks forth and enlivens my eye: When she leaves me, I wander forlorn, And Night's shadows descend on my sigh. O Venus! how cruel thine art, That bids us such beauty behold! In thee, how unkind to impart, To such beauty, a heart that is cold. Why fill'd is her eye with thy fire? Why giv'n was the voice of thy dove; The bosom and lip of desire, That will frown on the kisses of Love? VERSES Found in a Bower at Merton, on Lord Nelson's taking the Command of the British Fleet off Cadiz. From Merton's pleasing shades, again To give new wonders to the main, The hero seeks the Gaul— But, ah! what lost in Fancy's eye— I see him bleed, and hear the sigh, That mourns, ah! mourns his fall. Yet will his genius haunt the grove, And Britons, who their country love, Shall here with ardour glow; Drink inspiration from his name, And, emulous to join his fame, Shall pant to meet the foe. And Beauty too will wander here, To give to Merton's stream a tear, And pensive mark her bow'rs: For what, though glory charm'd his heart; The softer graces claim'd a part, And sooth'd his peaceful hours. TO HELEN IN TOWN. Sweet Helen! the dews of the morn Our steps to the valley invite; The linnet, the thrush on the thorn, Are preparing to yield thee delight. Then haste from the town and its noise, Health is ready to yield thee her treasure; Then from tumult repair to our joys, To the region of silence and pleasure. From our cots we will wander away, And find out the haunt of the dove, Where he coos to his mate on the spray, And study sweet lessons of love. O! then we will stray to the bow'r, Where I'll gaze on thy beautiful features; Thy kisses of fragrance devour, And coo like those innocent creatures. Ah! I fear me, I ask her in vain, The town will detain the dear maid, The tongues of the beaux in her train Are rivals to stillness and shade. Yet, what folly to think one so fair, Would bless with her smile a poor swain, Be sooth'd, and be won by his pray'r, Who can rivet a world in her chain! THE INCONSTANT. The sigh of her heart was sincere, When blushing, she whisper'd her love; A sound, how divine, in my ear, For her voice was the voice of the dove. Ah! who could from Phillida fly? Yet I sought other nymphs of the vale, Forgot both her blush and her sigh, Nay, forgot that I told her my tale. In sorrow I wish'd to return, And the tale of my passions renew; ‘False shepherd,’ she answer'd with scorn, ‘False shepherd, for ever adieu! ‘For thee, no more tears will I shed, To Truth and sweet friendship I go; The bird by a wound that has bled Is happy to fly from his foe.’ ELEGY ON JESSICA. To her grave will I follow the fair, Nor blush her pale corse to sustain Whose graces, alas! were her snare, Which Prudery beheld with disdain. Her youth was the blossom of May, Her voice was the nightingale's tune, Her cheek the pure crimson of day, And her mind the mild beams of the moon. So fair and unguarded a form Drew the lightnings of danger around; A victim she fell to the storm, And blush'd a sweet wreck on the ground! By the splendor of riches and pow'r, Sweet Innocence oft is undone— Unguarded, too, many a flow'r Has sunk by the rays of the sun. I saw thee when beauty was thine, Too rich for the poet's poor arms; When Envy confess'd it divine, And Wonder would gaze on its charms; I have seen thee when lovers around, In hope of thy favour, would stand; And in sorrow depart, when they found Not a smile, nor a kiss from thy hand. And saw, when no more it inspir'd, No longer our hearts to beguile, From thy bosom, when Rapture retir'd, And the loves had withdrawn from thy smile. And when conquest, alas! was no more, I heard thee in poverty moan, Asking alms, but in vain, at the door Of the mansion that once was thy own. Unwept shall poor Jessica lie, And neglected be scorn'd on the bier? Though hard Virtue refuse her a sigh, Yet Pity shall give her a tear. A SONG TO A COQUETTE. Dear Phillis! thou know'st not thy charms; That thy cheek boasts the bloom of the rose; That thine eye by its lustre alarms; That thy bosom surpasses the snows. Thou know'st thou hast wit at thy will; Yet from wit, often Prudence departs: Thus furnish'd with weapons to kill, Thou daily art murd'ring poor hearts. Not safely a swain can pass by, Thou art ready his steps to beguile; Some lure is thrown out from thine eye, Some lure from a song or a smile. O learn from the minstrel of night A lesson to govern the maid! Though he fills every ear with delight, He sings amid silence and shade. LAURA, A PASTORAL SONG. O my heart! thou so lately wert blest, Those days I shall ever adore— When Pleasure alone was thy guest, But to meet thee, ah! meet thee no more. How dull was the grove and the bow'r, If the maid of thy love was not nigh! She gave bloom, she gave life to each flow'r, But with Laura, dear Laura, they die. Lo! the linnets, enlivening the shade, No longer give joy to my ear— But their carols, how sweet, when the maid, The pride of the valley, was near! To the gloom, near yon fount, let me go, Indulging of Fancy the dream; I will listen to murmurs of woe, And hear my sad tale in the stream. A LYRIC EPISTLE TO MYSELF. [PART I.] Sir! you possess a deal of spirit, A deal, indeed, of sterling merit; Your head was cast in Nature's nicest mould— Whatever meets your touch or view, Is poetry at once—Peru— You turn, like Midas, ev'ry thing to gold. A block of marble, it is said, Holds a fine statue, or fine head; A very sage remark beyond a doubt: The only difficulty lies In bringing to our wond'ring eyes, This very curious head or statue out! Of fiddles too, we may declare, Each holds a fascinating air; But say, what cunning hand can touch this fiddle? To bring out this enchanting sound, You, sir, are fortunately found In the good graces of Miss Tweedle Tweedle. Your tuneful art at once creates! Description on your pencil waits, Whene'er you paint the storm or give the sigh, The thunders of the roaring deep, The infant's smiling harmless sleep, The wolf's red glare, or pearl on Pity's eye. Again—a canvass, sir, or board, Holds pictures by the heart ador'd: And, sir, such ingenuity is yours; You work out very fine old heads, And hills sublime, and flow'ry meads, To last as long as picture's self endures. Heav'ns, what a Proteus! now you rise— A daring eagle to the skies, Surveying princes on their thrones below, Small as tomtits upon a twig, Or simple robins on a sprig— Not half th' importance of a rook or crow. In short, scarce bigger than a mite, So very little in the sight Of this sublimely soaring sun-clad fowl, As in Charles Fox's eye George Rose; And that is small enough, God knows; Or Eldon, under Thurlow's piercing scowl. And now a turtle-making love— Saying soft things to Mistress Dove, Billing with quiv'ring wings, and coo, and song; Now busy building a neat nest, Discussing now, supremely blest, The future education of their young. So happily the heart to move, You touch the tender lyre of Love; Exciting now the tear, and now the smile. I should not wonder, sir, (between us, Under the Rose) if Madam Venus, Presented you the freedom of her isle. Some make you sour and supercilious, And splenetic and atrabilious; That is to say, an ocean of hot bile: Now, sir, I know you are not bilious; To coin a word, sir, rather chylous— A silky milky fount of purest chyle. Some paint you a mad bull, wild roaring, Tossing folks on your horns, and goring; This picture verily provokes my laugh: You ar'n't that formidable creature, Of milder elements your nature; Your character resembles more the calf. The ladies too, so frighten'd, fear ye, They feel not courage to come near ye; And yet you treat them with much love and ease: I know your manners are so bland, The sweetest ladies of the land, May take whatever liberties they please. Then, sir, your reverence for the sex; You ne'er abuse them, never vex; But so much love, so Ovid-like is giv'n: So much, sir, for your soul I fear, If charming woman was not there, You would not, if 'twere offer'd, go to Heav'n. You paint so sweetly Love's alarms; The neat historian of their charms: Touch with such rich luxuriance form and air. In gratitude the sex should join, And give you gold for ev'ry line; Nay, make you poet laureate to the fair. Ulysses-like, the world around, What mines of treasure you have found; Though not the mines that purchase in the stocks. So polish'd, you return'd from travel; Like a rough stone or lump of gravel, That for the ocean leave their barren rocks. When sickness sinks their spirits low, And damps their animated glow, Stops the poor lab'ring heart and flutt'ring breath; The lightnings of your page illume, The eye's wan melancholy gloom, And ope its film again, though clos'd in death. It is with Envy, sir, a law, To find in every fame a flaw; Enough, you boast for Envy's tooth, a mountain! Pure flowing from the muses' hills, Let Envy mud a thousand rills, You still remain a full and beauteous fountain! Sir, should you through the country pass, And put up at the Horse, or Ass, Blue Boar, or Magpie, Ram, or Goat, or Bear: At once the people of the village, Would leave their tools, and quit their tillage; To take in wonders at the eye and ear! Were Pidcock through our isle to go, And, sir, present you for a show, What towns, what cities, would your form amuse! He would get money to some tune! More, sir, than by his huge baboon, His wondrous elephant, and kangaroos. Fools, who would throw you into shade, Declare no genius is display'd, Nature, Originality, Sublime, No ease, no humour, and no wit; Sir, let fools say, what fools think fit; Trust to that upright scrutineer, call'd Time. Your rival brothers of the quill, Are moles beneath their dirty hill; That darksome labour, and the field destroy: Or, just like beetles from the ground, That rise, and hum, and buzz around; And reeling, ev'ry traveller annoy. Abhorrent of the spectred shade, Your mighty mind for light was made; You for the regions of the stars were born: So like the lark, with liquid lay, Impatient of the coming day; That mounting breaks into the beams of morn. You're a nice candle, let me say, Burning with mild and steady ray; But let a saucy moth desert his hole, And flap the flame with wanton wing; We hear him his own requiem sing, Stretch'd 'midst the altar's fire, a shrivell'd coal! Your soul is full of summer weather; A zephyr that scarce moves a feather: But when your vengeance wakes upon your foes, Farewell the smiling cherub mien; The Jove of wrath at once is seen, Flame in your eye, and thunder on your brows. Then, lo! the spirit of the storm, Wild bursting forth—a giant form; Lashing the surly billows to a roar; That heaves old Ocean from his bed, Bids him disgorge his swallow'd dead; And pour his wrecks upon the foamy shore. Sir, like a trav'ller at some stile, That, wearied, stops to breathe awhile, The muse one minute shall suspend her lays: Or, like a miller's, sir, my wheel, Fatigued, shall some small respite feel; And so I close the flood-hatch of your praise. PART II. Seven cities of the Grecian world Pull'd wigs, pull'd caps, foul language hurl'd; On Homer's birth-place! proud t'exalt their horn: Pray let us take especial care, Not thus to kindle up a war By not informing folks where you were born. Cornwall and Devonshire, perhaps, May for your birth pull wigs and caps: Now, sir, I do not really mean to quiz ye; Was it in Dodbrook that the light First enter'd on your precious sight; Or, sir, at gallant Foy, or Mevagizzy? Sir, I believe that I can guess! Your birth-place Dodbrook deign'd to bless; Fam'd for white ale, and bullocks, ewes, and rams: 'Twas in this spot your genius rare Did first inhale the vital air, And caught the tender spirit of the lambs. Of what religion are you, pray? I think, sir, I have heard you say The Quaker's, void of noise and ostentation; And to the great, sublime, all-wise Creator of ten thousand skies, That Silence is the highest adoration. Oh! would the great Longinus rise, And on your labours cast his eyes, Touch'd with what rapture would he read your rhime: Soon would he cry, ‘O men of metre, Hide your diminish'd heads at Peter; Here burns the bard! here tow'rs the true sublime. ‘Here glows of Poetry the soul! Here Fancy's boundless oceans roll: To him, what are ye? crackers and a bomb! Compar'd to him, ye rhiming men— The bird of Jove! and humble wren; The pyramids! and some poor Turkish tomb. ‘Of this rich gem of lucid nature, Ah! could ye imitate the water; Obtain the mantle of high mounting Pindar; Though not up near him cheek by jowl; Ye still might be a lump of coal, That flames and warms with very little cinder.’ I know that flatt'ry's apt to wound; There's rum, there's brandy in the sound; Yet not to inebriate geniuses like you; You, sir, are proof against this spirit; Yet there's a proverb upon Merit; Which, says the proverb, ‘Give the Devil his due.’ A little flatt'ry's right—I dare Tell men of genius what they are; A pretty stimulus to emulation: A farthing candle merits praise; Ev'n Canning has his tiny rays, Though born not to illuminate a nation. The little dew-drops on the field Possess a splendour, though they yield To sparkling diamonds—yet they have their hour; They charm us with their elfin light; At morn the nymphs and swains invite; Adorn and feed the herbage and the flower. Ah! should I pull off a wren's head, And strike the little warbler dead, Because like Philomel not loud and clear; Or break Arachne's tender line, Whose silken texture can't confine Hyrcanian tigers, or a Russian bear? Ah! when, sir, you resign your breath (For verse has no effect on Death, Ne'er melted his dull leaden ear by metre), A thousand beauteous eyes in gloom, Will drop their pearls upon your tomb, Poor mourning pilgrims at the shrine of Peter. Sir, sir, you never ought to die, But, like Elijah, mount on high; Not like a paltry, crawling worm expire: A bard of your transcendent fame, If not a chariot, sure might claim A handsome curricle, or gig of fire. Where are the princes of the land, And men of rank, a chosen band? Betting on Lewes, or on Brighton course! Sancho, Pavilion, and 'Squire Mellish, Have spoil'd for Pegasus all relish, Poor Pegasus! the Muses' fav'rite horse! Lo! liveries on the racer wait, He eats, and drinks, and sleeps in state; So cropp'd his ears, so comb'd his tail and mane: While Pegasus neglected lies Upon a dunghill, shuts his eyes, And lean and ragged grazes through a lane. Is't possible with all your pow'rs, With all your poetry's fine flow'rs, That you should gain no patronage, no pension? 'Tis strange! 'tis passing strange, indeed! This, when Posterity shall read, What will it say? ‘Impossible!—invention.’ Amid the swallowing gulf of Time What wrecks, alas! of prose and rhime; But, lo! this gulf shall not thy bark devour; Lo! all sails set, I see it brave The fury of the thundering wave, Wind on the quarter, fourteen knots an hour. Lord, sir! you don't know half your fame— When dead a century, your name Will, snow-ball-like, increase with rolling years; Ev'n your worst song, which you may call A common vulgar tune, that's all, Will then be deem'd the music of the spheres. Yet, with your mountain of high merit; Yet, with your ocean of proof spirit, You gain no praise, no favour from reviewers, Who call your lucubrations stuff, Not fit to wrap up cheese or snuff, Scarce fit to travel through the common sewers. Folks will inquire about your size; Your hair or wig, your nose, your eyes; Whether you were not taller than a steeple— In conversation, hawk or dove; Whether, like other men, made love; Wore clothes, and eat, and drank like other people! Excuse this tribute of fair praise, Due, sir, to your immortal lays: Sincere is this address, or ode, or letter; Perchance your modesty may blush: It is your failing, sir, but tush, No man admires you more, or likes you better. ONE MORE PEEP AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY; OR, ODES TO ACADEMICIANS, &amp;c. &amp;c. Sunt quibus in Satyrâ videar nimis acer, et ultra Legem tendere opus, &amp;c. HOR. Some folks declare (to wound my dove-like nature) I mingle too much acid with my satire; Too prone to smile at garters, stars, and strings, And take strange liberties with queens and kings; Roast on my ordeal, like an inquisition, Peer, parson, poet, pimp, academician: While others swear, two bastards of Apollo, The bellman and Matthias beat me hollow. [Again th' Academy I greet] The Bard, after a long Absence, saluteth the Royal Academy.—He singeth in a Strain of high Panegyric of himself—yet acknowledging the malevolent Depredations of Time on his Person. Again th' Academy I greet, Once more, my graphic friends, we meet— Shake hands—Ah! why the greeting hand withdraw? Lo! by your looks ye seem to say— ‘Avaunt, thou vagabond—away— We'd sooner take the Devil by the paw!’ Well, well! once more the bard appears; He sings, in spite of rolling years: Time has not stol'n one atom of his fire; The Muse, unconscious of decay, Still pours the proud Pindaric lay, Still strikes with equal energy the lyre. Now cries the critic of my rhime, ‘How dar'st thou dream of the sublime, And fancy that it e'er inspir'd thy odes? ‘How dar'st thou take a Pindar's name, To steal into the dome of Fame, And place thy Momus by the side of Gods?’— I own that Time, to my surprise, Has done some mischief to my eyes, And done that mischief much against my will: But as the bulfinch, beyond doubt, Sings better when his eyes are out, Why not the songster of th' Aonian Hill? Time too has chosen to efface The fine Apollo form and grace, And somewhat bent to earth my lofty head; And though the knave has touch'd my hand, The goose-quill yet it can command, And o'er the snow the feather'd giant lead. Time has made free too with my features, Those pretty inoffensive creatures, That never yet were cruel to the fair; Spoil'd my poor lip and dimple sleek, Run his hard ploughshare o'er my cheek, And stol'n the blushing roses that were there. Time too, I own, my mouth has enter'd; To steal some pearl, the rogue has ventur'd, And giv'n a lisping to my tuneful tongue;— But, thank the Muses for their care, And Phœbus—of his tricks aware— Safe is my brain—the fount of flowing song. Th' academicians would rejoice If Time had also stol'n my voice;— But while that voice exists, by heav'ns, I'll sing!— But mind me, while I pour my lays, To justice I my altar raise, Too virtuous to profane the Muses' spring. It certainly must be confest, I come a most unwelcome guest, 'Mid sheaves of corn a sort of wicked weovil:— As for R. A.'s I briefly tell 'em, Fiat justitia ruat cœlum, Although they sooner would behold the devil. WEST. [Now let me turn to Mister West] The Bard complimenteth Mr. West on his Lord Nelson—acknowledgeth his Powers in a certain Department of the Art—but biddeth him beware of the dangers of Classic Ground. Now let me turn to Mister West: Thy Nelson, it must be confest, Proves that thy Muse of painting is not dead: 'Midst works of Merit be it plac'd— The hero's form is not disgrac'd, Which adds a leaf of laurel to thy head. At small defects I scorn to carp— This would be prying much too sharp— I think this piece will help to boil thy pot: And should it a good turbot gain, As poets are a famish'd train, Send the poor bard an invitation note.— Why will not mortals be content, And walk the road which Nature meant, And not eternally with Genius war?— And yet 'tis passing strange, though true, They keep th' impossible in view, And bid defiance to their ruling star. The men in miniature who shine Pant to extend their little line, And paint the forms of goddesses and gods; And then, like Phæton, the fool, A puppy of Ambition's school, Disgrac'd they tumble from the bright abodes! And 'tis in Music just the same— The tuneful nymph or tuneful dame, That in cantabile delights the soul, The sweet simplicity forsakes; From octave leaps, to octave takes, And seeks to triumph in bravura howl! The lap-dog just as well might say— ‘I think I'll hunt the hare to-day, And in proud triumph lead the hound or beagle!’ Or sparrow, on the chimney top, ‘I hate this life of chirp and hop, I'll drink the solar blaze, and mount an eagle!’ West, let me as a friend advise— From classic ground withdraw thine eyes; Nor fancy from sublime to gather glory:— Attempt not things beyond thy reach— The pebble on the sandy beach, Can ne'er expect to rise a promontory!— FUSELI. The Poet attacketh Mr. Fuseli for attempting sublime Subjects—also for vainly supposing he hath caught a Shred of the Mantle of Michael Angelo—He commendeth his Picture of Beaufort, but hinteth his Suspicion of its being a smuggled Affair—He wondereth that the Ghosts of Shakespeare and Milton do not leave their Tombs, to punish the Painter for the Disgrace brought upon them by the Imbecility of his Pencil.—The Poet concludeth with Advice of much Humanity. Ah, Master Fuseli! are you here, To whom Abuse's speech is dear; Whose jaundic'd eye can rarely merit see! Well, since thy penchant is a grin, It will not be a mortal sin To give the world a gentle grin at thee. What dæmon put it in thy head, To fix on Beaufort's dying bed? Was it the rage of Criticism to rouse?— Speak!—was it thy ambitious hope, With Reynolds, of high fame, to cope, And envious tear the laurel from his brows! Fuseli, thou callest Beaufort thine— Speak truth—is this thy own design? But mum—this is a very ticklish theme— The palsied hand, that ne'er was found To lift a weight beyond a pound, Will ne'er be thought to raise a weaver's beam. Thy friends, or rather foes, declare, Thou often dost sublimely dare, And makest Michael Angelo thy model; Moreover, that thou dost inherit Large portions of that painter's spirit— God still their tongues, or mend each crazy noddle! They tell thee that thou art a whale, Thy mind on Nature's noblest scale!— The folk who flatter thus, mean arrant mockery! They call thee a fine China jar— But this I humbly beg to bar, They should have said, a pipkin of brown crockery! Now let not wicked people say, I wander far from Truth away:— Truth, heaven-born Truth, presides o'er ev'ry stricture: Fuseli, indeed, I don't deny Thou e'er hadst Michael in thine eye; But say, thou never found'st him in thy picture. How dares thy hand, that cannot hit The features of a poor tom-tit, Attempt the eagle's fury in its flight— That cannot paint a tame tom-cat, Or muzzle of a mouse, or rat, Attempt the lordly lion in his might? Oh! why in colour dip thy brush, And, mad, upon thy ruin rush, And yield thy back to meet the lash of Satire? Thy blue and green flesh (let me say) No compliment to Beauty pay— A putrid carcase is not charming nature. Fuseli, whose hand with Nature wars, Inform me, what provok'd thy stars. To make thee serve a 'prenticeship to Paint?— What crimes have thy forefathers done, That thus they should condemn the son To bid him daub the cloth with devil and saint! Thou really wantest not discerning— Hast gain'd a little classic learning— And mayest in thy proper sphere be jogging; And as ill-nature much is thine, A pedagogue had been thy line, Then, like Orbilius, thou hadst shone in flogging. There are some rooms thou callest thine As keeper of the Royal Academy., Replete with workmanship divine; Of Grecian art—the connoisseurs don't doubt 'em— Say, Fuseli, did these rare antiques Ne'er give thee grins, and cuffs, and kicks, For daring to inform thy boys It is in Mr. Fuseli's department to superintend the young students of the Antique Academy. about 'em? Lo, from their graves, in glory laid, Each bard, a long-lamented shade, Shall start with horror from his sweet repose; The ghost of Shakespeare shall arise, And Milton, with his darken'd eyes, To pull the daring dauber by the nose! Thou hast a place, both nice and snug; Good victuals, and a good warm rug— Let not a false ambition prompt thee further: Then bid thy cruel labours cease, And let the canvass sleep in peace, Nor make it cry out ‘Murther! murther! murther! The Lord is call'd a man of war— Beyond thy pow'rs how distant far! But, shouldst thou dare attempt the form—I fear Thy mangling hand would make sad work; And, with the fierceness of a Turk, Cut down the Thunderer to a privateer! Remark.—Mr. Fuseli should expect no lenity from the rod of Criticism, after having himself uttered the following sarcasm upon a brother-artist, Opie, at a time too when he was in apparent friendship with that ingenious painter—‘Dere is dat poo-re dogue Opee—de failow can paaynt notin but teeves an morederers—an wen de dogue paaynts a teef or a morederer, he lookes in de glass.’ LOUTHERBOURG. The Poet, as formerly, findeth Fault with Mr. Loutherbourg for his volcanic Landscapes—maketh a splendid Comparison—giveth good pecuniary Advice—complimenteth him—and endeavoureth to beat him out of his Belief in the Metalleity of general Nature. A Critic always should be just: Illiberality's a rust, Which dulls the edge and splendor of his knife; There should not reign a mean hostility, But friendship, tenderness, civility, And Art and Criticism be man and wife. A vulgar world delights in glare, Adores whatever makes a stare; The sober tints of Nature they despise: And thus they like the pomp of Pride, While Modesty, disdain'd, decried, Roams some pale solitude with downcast eyes. I bade thee, certain years ago, In landscape no complexion show Of warming-pan, brass candlestick, or kettle:— My eloquence could not persuade— As if a brazier born by trade, We see the staring culinary metal! The scullion, cook, and kitchen-maid, Are vastly fond of stiff brocade, With cabbage-roses deck'd—a gaudy train— This really is a vicious taste— And, much like theirs, is thine unchaste— French frippery has too much engross'd thy brain But of the stubborn world, I fear, In vain my counsels strike the ear; Proudly they treat those counsels with disdain— The flint and steel of Peter's wit Not ev'n a single spark can hit T'illumine their dark tinder-box of brain! There is a mineral that bright is, By learned chemists call'd pyrites— Mundic in Cornwall—which contains a store; The bagmen Persons travelling for mercantile orders, commonly styled knights of the bag., as they travel by, Survey it with a raptur'd eye, And fill their pockets with the treach'rous ore. With Poetry 'tis just the same: How Doctor Darwin won a name, By glitt'ring tinsel epitheted rhime!— Divine Simplicity was fled, Driv'n, banish'd, dar'd not show her head, Whose pow'rs alone support the true sublime. Once more give ear unto a friend; Ev'n now 'tis not too late to mend: But if thou merely mean'st thy works to sell, Then pour thy yellows, purples, greens, And reds and blues, for rural scenes, And make thy burning skies as hot as H?. I grant thy execution neat, And grant in little thou art great: But take a hint—and not a hint improper; Learn, Loutherbourg, to thy surprise, That grass and water, cows and skies, Are things which Nature never makes of copper. Griev'd should I be to rouse thine ire; But be not so profuse of fire, Nor flame so furiously upon our eyes:— Let not thy hills be quite so hot; Where really one might boil a pot, And roast a leg of mutton at thy skies. JOHN LANE. The Bard exhibiteth Symptoms of Surprise and Pleasure at the Mary and Christ of Mr. Lane, a very young Artist—Evinceth his Preference of the sublime to the humbler Branches of the Art—and concludeth with a just Satire on himself. What have we here! A charming picture Bidding defiance to sharp stricture; Ye farthing rush-lights, that around us wink, Oh, hide each poor diminish'd head; Of competition be afraid, For verily with shame ye ought to shrink. A youth whose years are just nineteen, Who scarcely ought has done or seen, And never yet beheld the gods of Rome— While your small lights, as I have said, Should hide each poor diminish'd head, This stripling's torch illuminates the dome! I hail thy genius—Mind thy hits— Beyond the reach of damning wits: To court th' historic muse, be thy ambition; Prophetic, I aver thy line Amid the Roman school will shine, And not disgrace the great Carrache or Titian. Now should our bishops drop the saint, Revoke anathemas on paint, And suffer saints and martyrs in St. Paul's, Who for their good opinions died, Boil'd, roasted, carbonaded, fried; Thy hand should tell their story on the walls. Let others search the ragged cot For brooms, joint-stools, plate, pan, and pot— I mean not on such genius to be bitter— But were I free to choose a name, I should not covet a Dutch fame, That hunts for immortality in litter. To move a men now, who would wish— In paltry brooks a paltry fish— While Nature offers him to roll a whale!— Unmatch'd, with mighty fins to sweep The boundless region of the deep, And sport amid the thunders of the gale? And this to me may be applied— The world will cry—‘Where is thy pride, To put thy muse on Academic Odes;— When, if she chose it, she might sport Amidst the grandeur of a court, And strike the lyre to goddesses and gods?’ TO WILKIE. The Poet congratulateth Mr. Wilkie (a very young Artist) on his Performances—but adviseth him to exert his Genius in a higher Sphere of the Art. Wilkie, an honour to thy nation, Accept the muse's admiration— Thou giv'st to Johnson's envious tongue the lie, Proclaiming that on Scottish ground No plant of genius will be found— Which, totis viribus, I dare deny. I think thou mayst a Hogarth shine; That wit and humour both are thine— No common present from the Delian god: Then try thy wing—exert thy pow'r; Below thee leave Teniers and Brouwer, And prove a prophet in the man of ode. TO TURNER. The Bard maketh a Bow to the Genius of Mr. Turner, and expresseth Wonder at the Absence of his Landscapes. Turner, whatever strikes thy mind, Is painted well, and well design'd; Thy rural scenes our plaudit must obtain— Though Nature (and where lies the harm?) Has giv'n thee not a giant form, The dame has plac'd the giant in thy brain. Say, why are not thy landscapes here— Landscapes where truth and taste appear; That prove thy pencil's pow'rs, and grasp of mind? Who nobly canst exalt thine head? Who, like Eclipse A celebrated race-horse., canst take the lead, And leave with ease thy rivals far behind. TO BACON. The Poet informeth Mr. Bacon of his Progress in the Art of Sculpture—Adviseth him to be expeditious in his Improvements, on account of the rapid Strides of an elderly Gentleman called Time—He lamenteth the Want of Patronage to Sculpture—and sigheth for the Return of Athenian Days. Bacon, I think thou dost improve: But, prithee, somewhat faster move:— These works display more fire and spirit in ye: Time flies—accelerate thy pace, Although thou catch not in the race Phidias, Praxiteles, or ev'n Bernini!— Shame!—that in this our wealthy isle, Poor Sculpture is not seen to smile; Forc'd, nearly forc'd to beg her humble bread— While ev'ry face-maker can feast— Quaff with his lordship wines the best, Whose art can scarce pourtray a poor calf's head! Oh, when will ancient Greece revive, Where Sculpture taught her forms to live?— (Poor dame, in Britain, put upon the shelf)— Where hero, demi-god, and god, Full often, as the streets they trod, Scarce knew th' ingenious marble from himself. TO GARRARD. The Poet uttereth very handsome Things of Mr. Garrard—and adviseth him to support his prover Dignity, and despise the academic Honours. Garrard, thou Myron of the age, Whose works the eye of Taste engage, Where is thy cattle, that delight affords?— What, none!—Now, Garrard, to be free, More pleas'd, indeed, am I to see A thinking bull's head than a thoughtless lord's! Refus'd the academic crown, Thou losest nothing of renown:— Trust to true genius, which thou dost inherit— Beyond the reach of Envy's breath, The cold, the chilling blast of Death, For ever warring with the blooms of Merit. Th' Academy (ah! fie upon her!) Can now confer no crown of honour; She asks submission mean, and oaths most hearty— She hunts not for ingenious folk— The pencil's pow'rs are now a joke— She only wants a tool to serve a party. In vain thou knockest at the door; Knock at th' Academy no more, And to such small ambition bid adieu:— Who on a mouse's paltry hole Would fix the wishes of his soul, While Fame's fair temple opens to his view? TO NOLLEKENS. The Bard singeth to the Praise of Mr. Nollekens, but condemneth him as the supposed Executioner of a certain Bishop's Sentence on the Bosom of a beautiful Greek Vestal. With pleasure, Nollekens, I see The muse of Sculpture wake in thee, And Britain, who has been so long asleep— Well!—since thy works such worth display, Brisk, stir thy stumps, and work away, And with the gems of Athens, Britain heap! How could thy sacrilegious hand Obey the bishop's dread command, And slice the bosom of the Grecian maid?— That Phidias' angry ghost would rise With mealy face, and saucer eyes, To break thy chisel—wert thou not afraid?— Oh, where was Venus in that hour, To snatch the vestal from thy pow'r? An action so barbaric chills my blood!— Now, do not, Nollekens, dissemble: Did not thy hand with horror tremble, And thy two eyes let fall a plenteous flood? How did the bishop's wife behave On this most sacrilegious shave— Did not the lady smile upon the garble?— She might—for ladies old and dry, Inspir'd by Jealousy, can spy A dreaded rival in a piece of marble! TO DUBOST. In Mistress Hope, Monsieur Dubost, Thy genius yieldeth up the ghost; In truth, in portrait thou art not at home:— Why wander from thy proper sphere? Now, had thy Damocles A most masterly picture by this artist, and purchased by Mr. Hope. been here, Thy slave had tower'd the tyrant of the dome. ODES TO THE HEADS. The Bard addresseth, in plaintive Ditty, the Heads of the Lord knows who—painted by the Lord knows whom, and executed the Lord knows how. Ladies and gemmen, masters, misses, I dare not compliment your phizzes; Indeed fit subjects for the lash of Satire— If Truth conduct the painter's brush, What madness bade ye hither rush, Such melancholy, sad burlesques on Nature?— Thou poor sour face, who seem'st to sigh Because thou art hung up so high, So near the window—prithee, do not growl— Thou need'st not feel a great alarm, Jack Ketch had done no mighty harm If out o'window he had hung thy jowl! And who art thou, so round and fat?— Why didst thou quit the brewer's vat?— But tell me, vulgar gentleman, who art? I am no Œdipus, indeed; And yet thy occupation read— That is, a running footman to a cart! TO A FEMALE HEAD. Pert, smirking Miss, you seem to sally From Dyot-Street, or Black-boy Alley; And no small consequence you seem to feel:— Pray, Miss, go back—your trade pursue— Put on your cover-slut of blue, And stick to tripe, sheeps' trotters, and cow-heel. TO A MAN'S HEAD. Say, who art thou, devoid of grace, With round and dull unmeaning face, Whose head-piece seems to want a further stuffing? Speak!—cam'st thou, by vain-glory won, To prove that Nature, in her fun, May on a pair of shoulders place a muffin? TO THE SOMBRE FACE OF PARSON CODMAN. ‘Angels and ministers of grace defend us!’ What, Copley, dost thou hither send us?— Is it a ‘goblin damn'd,’ who in his dark-hole Has just been dining upon pitch and charcoal?— Zounds! 'tis a man—and yet a very odd man— Ladies and gentlemen, 'tis Parson Codman! 'Squire Copley, was it meant in fun, To fabricate this thing forlorn?— What has th' unhappy parson done, That thou shouldst hang him up to scorn? Perchance 'twas modesty, t'impart Thy humble knowledge in the art— Yet, certain proofs Let not Mr. Copley shrink at the introduction of the word proofs, which the voice of Scandal might construe into a squint at a suspected transaction of past times. the bard incline To think this virtue never thine. TO THE PORTRAIT OF HELEN. Sweet Helen! with thee, in the vale, With rapture my hours have been crown'd, When the turtle was telling his tale, And the lambkins were sporting around. In the cottage I too have been blest, When thy beauty the cottage adorn'd; And when thy soft hand I have prest, I have fancied my youth was return'd. But why, my sweet-girl, art thou here, With mop-squeezers, venders of cheese, With the calf, and the bull, and the bear?— What horrid companions are these! But where is thy form and thy grace— Where those eyes that with lustre should shine?— Dear Helen, I look on a face That never, ah! never, was thine! Painters seldom in beauty succeed— Grace and canvass but seldom agree— Thou hast honour'd the painter, indeed; But the knave has done nothing for thee! TO A HEAD. You are a tailor, sir, I guess, Just whipp'd into his lordship's dress; Leap'd from your board, no Mercury so nimble! But from your board when pleas'd to skip, Why leave behind, good Master Snip, Your good friend Goose, the needle, thread, and thimble? TO TWO HEADS. And who art thou, with face so full? I ween, thou keepest the Black Bull, Red Lion, White Horse Cellar, or Brown Bear— And madam, you there, by his side, I guess, are Boniface's bride; Methinks the tap-room is your proper sphere! TO A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG LADY, LATELY DECEASED. The nymph, by the Graces adorn'd, Who led all the Loves in her train, By the lyre of the muse shall be mourn'd, While the lyre has a chord to complain. Sweet image, that never wilt fade, In thee lives her form, and her bloom! When in thee I behold the dear maid, I forget that she sleeps in the tomb! TO A FEMALE HEAD. You, madam, this fine dome adorning, Rise early every Monday morning, To join your linen, soap and lie, and tub— Then take a glass of comfort for your spirits— Your sisterhood with rapture hail— Enjoy the jest and smutty tale— Like quality—without the blush of shame! TO ANOTHER. Welcome, sweet Miss, in ochre bloom, Trick'd out to grace this glorious room; Hopp'd from your humble bulk—behind a string— Where an odd slipper and odd shoe, Where laces, yellow, red, and blue, And wig and comb, in graceful order swing!— A watch of gingerbread—one patten— A shoe-string, and a stripe of satin; A handkerchief of check, that makes a blaze; A various tribe of love-sick sonnet, Fur tippet, muff, and rusty bonnet; An infant's pudding, and a pair of stays. TO ANOTHER FEMALE HEAD. And bulky ma'am, of the same school, Like patience on a three-legg'd stool— Accept my bow—behind the lines suspending A flannel wig, and half a shirt, Not much the whiter for the dirt— Gowns without tails, that cry aloud for mending! A child's cap, torn by time and rockings; Two mittens, from two old black stockings; A ragged parasol, a leathern cat, David the king, in gingerbread— King Solomon without his head, Devour'd by some d?n'd jacobinic rat! CONCLUSION. Now to be serious—O ye men! (Few eagles, and too many a wren)— How dare ye fill the room with such pollution?— Will Justice say, while thus ye hang So sad and villanous a gang, Yourselves should not be led to execution? How cruel to keep Genius out, To favour fools, and rabble rout;— Where is the just and independent spirit?— Ah! dinners It is a shameful and notorious fact, that dinners, patronage, and favouritism, have been uniformly the means of introducing performances beneath the dignity of criticism, to the exclusion of works deserving the public attention. and a glass of port Can favour trash of ev'ry sort, And thus exclude the works of real merit. Great George, in all thy wrath arise— Turn to thy royal dome thine eyes— And smartly kick each academic tether:— But should this deed disgrace thy glory, As sounding not sublime in story, Bid Sam the porter knock their heads together! ANTICIPATION: OR, THE PRIZE ADDRESS; Which will be delivered ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW DRURY-LANE THEATRE, BY ONE OF THE MANAGERIAL PHALANX, In the Character of PETER PUNCHEON, A LANDLORD. Now first published, for the sake of gratifying a great and impatient Empire, BY PHILOMATH WIZARD, ASTROLOGER. ? sapiens dominabitur astris. The stars I view through Galileo's eyes, And find this very Poem claims the prize. The sage who peeps into futurity, May prophesy with much security; And say what chickens Father Time Will, hen-like, hatch in prose and rhyme: But, Lord! how few, let me remark, Can pierce the blanket of the dark! Resembling the sweet bird of morn, On airy wing sublimely borne, That, ere the valley feels the ray, Proclaims the birth of bright'ning day. Ladies, and Gentlemen, I'm Peter Puncheon! Welcome to dinners, suppers, or a luncheon. First, let me swear, if such be your desire, I never got one farthing by the fire. Oons! dev'lish happy had I been, to catch The rogue that pil'd the stuff, and plac'd the match; He soon had suffer'd for his burning game, That knave's fine carcase-fat had felt the flame. So much to vice insurances persuade, The burning system, is a thriving trade. The man to-night a beggar on his pillow, To-morrow sports a curricle and villa; For some folks can contrive estates to raise, And find the road to fortune by the blaze. (Applause. Well, Gentles, welcome to our new-old Inn; Well, stock'd our cellars, full is ev'ry bin: Old port, old hock, old cider, and old perry; But none of that neat article, Old Sherry! Which tho' well cork'd, and seal'd in quarts and pottles, Too frisky, bouncing, bankrupted the bottles. No wines of France I suffer to appear; Such my resolve—I'd sooner swill small-beer. No faithless Frenchman shall my purse maintain; No burgundy for me, no pert champaign; And sooner would I rent a cobweb garret, Than see my patriot glasses blush with claret. (More applause. 'Sbud! how I wish to meet with Emperor Nap, And catch him at my bar, or at my tap! I'd give him such a dose to warm his brain, He should not, like parole-rogues, cross the main: These hands should pull his pride imperial down, And to a less than sixpence clip his crown: Egad I'd make him look as sour, and sullen As on his praams so knock'd about off Boulogne. Poor fool, the puppet of poor foolish France, The boastful hero of a French romance, Not long the empire of the rogue will last— A mere French puff—no more—a sudden blast— Soon the mock Monarch shall to fate be hurl'd; For we who hold the trident, rule the world. (A thunder of applause. Now, Gents, for quadrupeds—below my care: I mount, no tutor to a horse, or mare; I keep no stables, beans, or oats, or hay; Such articles I leave to Marshal Neigh. Indeed I soar not from my humble station, T'exert my genius on horse-education; And yet I've often seen it come to pass, A sage turn'd trav'lling tutor to an ass; Nay too I've read, a rogue, to save his neck, Once undertook to teach a jackass Greek. Then as for newspapers, not one shall enter; I'll kick it to the devil that dare venture; Scattering dark doubts and lies to get its meat; Laughs at success, and glories in defeat; Sports raven-paragraphs that croak distress, And load with curses what is born to bless; That tries each art to rouse to arms the million, And rears the daring standard of rebellion; Pours out its jokes as fast as hail, or faster, And, demon-like, grows fat upon disaster; Like toads, that feed (a miserable doom) On the foul horrors of a dungeon's gloom. Such rebel paragraphs, to atoms strike 'em!— These are my politics—pray how d'ye like 'em? (Many plaudits, and some hisses. Now, with your leave, a toast let me advance: Health to Old England—ruin to New France! (Drinks.—Much applause, and a few hisses. Well, now I'm giving healths, suppose I say, Here's Wellington, the Marlborough of the day! (Wonderful applause. Here's to his arms, whose hug each Frenchman feels, And trusts his safety to his friends his heels. (Repeats his draught.—More applause. Here goes another toast—To General Hill! To every Frenchman a most bitter pill; Nephew of preaching Rowland, foe to evil— Religion's champion—Cribb who mills the Devil; Scares Beelzebub upon his blazing throne, And rescues souls Old Nick believ'd his own. (Drinks again.—Applause. Here's Graham too, and Stuart of high note! Damn him who damns an Irishman or Scot!— (Drinks.—Loud applause. But shall our navy be pass'd by? No, no, While ale or porter down this throat can flow.— St. Vincent, Cochran, Saumarez, Pellew, And dauntless bravery of our British crew, By whom such deeds of fortitude are done, As make old Neptune tremble for his throne. (Universal plaudits. Such are the heroes dough-fac'd Gallia fears, Atoning for the C??????s and G??????s. (Drinks.—Unlimited applause. Now let not our friend Whitebread be forgotten: I'll drink his porter till my bones are rotten; For mind me, Gentlefolks, (I no not frolick), I'll tip his stout altho' it gives the cholic: If I forget him, may my beer ne'er work, And this right hand forget to draw a cork: May heaven's blue lightning all my bins assail And thunder turn to vinegar my ale. Be every hogshead split to make me poor, And every foaming liquor float the floor; Nay, may I without a farthing in my fob, Scratch on a dirty dunghill just like Job. Whitebread—nice name—a name of fair renown; May Whitebread never turn to black or brown! Superior to the Commons, on his legs, As tuns to hogsheads, quarter casks, to kegs. Porter and Whitebread act two glorious parts: One charms our palates, and one charms our hearts: So soft his manner, such persuasive notes: Should envy doubt me, ask his Bedford votes. By this blue apron, and this porter mug, Which to my breast with gratitude I hug, I swear his head upon my sign I'll put, A quartern loaf, a dray-man, and a butt; On this the world, the gaping world, will stare, And wonder Whitebread never was Lord May'r: Since fish and fowl Alluding to the Fishmongers' and Poulterers' Company. the civic honours gain, Why not Sam's porter wear the golden chain? Fish, fowl, and porter following each other At ev'ry feast, amidst the hound-like pother. Whitebread this house for ever shall record And each bin bless him till it has no board. (Drinks.—Uncommon applause. Tho' last, not least, the Regent Prince—proof spirit, The friend of liberty, and friend of merit: Not flimsy gauze, but superfine strong cloth; No trifle, no whip-syllabub, no froth: His orb in glory has its course begun; May equal splendour crown his setting sun! (Drinks.—Huzzas and acclamations from every part of the house. In borough-terms—I thank ye for this plumper, Or, in the language of my bar, a bumper: Ladies and Gentlemen, in every part, (Bows to the whole house. Long may ye live, and merry be each heart. Tenfold may Heaven your kindnesses requite, And may I meet such custom ev'ry night! (Tumultuous plaudits, fans clapping, and white handkerchiefs waving. Yet yield attention, for I finish soon. What's jovial company, without a tune? What is a merry meeting, without song? Rasp catgut-scrapers, rasp, and tap the tongue: Roar, roar away—“Britannia, rule the waves, “For freeborn Britons never will be slaves!” [The music strikes up. [After the song, the Author will be honoured by being called for, in imitation of the French, to exhibit himself, be admired, and make his obeisance to the public; when the freedom of the house will be presented to him in a gold snuff box, and his brows encircled by a laurel crown.] A SOLEMN SENTIMENTAL, AND REPROBATING EPISTLE TO MRS. CLARKE. Dux Fœmina facti. Heavens! what is all this hurricane about? 'Tis Woman, Woman, raises all the rout. The Bard that oft to Love has pour'd his Lays, And tun'd to Phyllidas the Harp of Praise; (For lo, mere Touchwood, form'd of fond desire, A sparkling eye could set his Heart on fire;) With deep reluctance now assumes the rod, To punish that fair Master-piece of God. Few are the men that feel the soul's Queen-passion, Call'd Love, have scap'd from Lady-fascination. How few the Josephs that adorn the times! Let truth be told: ev'n I, the Man of Rhymes, Have oft approach'd the vortex of Seduction, Stalk'd the wild precipices of Destruction. A simple, nibbling Mouse (and nearly taken); Much have I marvell'd, how I sav'd my bacon. Heav'ns, what a dire confusion Beauty makes! The Horse Guards tremble, and Old Windsor shakes. Like Bees, the Mob around Saint Stephen's swarms; And every street and alley feels alarms: Men, women, coaches, gigs, each other jostle; And thou the cause of all this horrid bustle! Hotels and tap-rooms sound with mingled din, And every coffee-house is on the grin. From morn to eve, from eve to midnight dark, Nought strikes the ear but ‘Duke and Mistress Clarke!’ Nay, too, the Parrot, and the simple Starling, Cry from their cages nought but ‘Duke and Darling!’ In vain the heavy horse parade the town; Neigh bold defiance, while their riders frown: The Mob surveys them just like braying hacks, From door to door with dogs' meat on their backs. Each day we hear a miserable tale: See, by the Commons, Clavering sent to jail; Dismiss'd the staff, in durance vile to dwell, And join the piteous sighs of Sanden's cell!— See poor O'Meara, with an alter'd face, Who preach'd to Majesty with Paul-like grace! He damns the ladder of that exaltation, And blushes now to meet a congregation. ‘Farewell,’ he sighs, although so vastly clever, ‘Farewell the Mitre and Lawn-sleeves for ever! Yet not that loss alone calls forth my tears; The Hussy robs my life of twenty years.’— Behold the Tonyns, all with ire inflam'd; All, for the silly Major, all asham'd! And see, Miss Taylor, to thine arts a fool, Has found a Spunging-house, and lost her School. The mighty Castlereagh himself may fall, The pompous pillar that supports us all: I hear the crack, and mourn it most sincerely; And Ireland too will mourn, who loves him dearly: Ireland, to Castlereagh that so much owes; Her Union,—present, and her past, repose; And fine fertility, the eye that greets; For docks and grass adorn old Dublin's streets. Rais'd by thy witcheries, to fright our eyes, Ghosts of long-buried Depredations rise; But, thanks to our good Ministerial train, Will soon be banish'd to their tombs again. In Sparta thus confusion reign'd and strife, When wanton Paris stole the Monarch's wife. What Imp of Darkness whisper'd in thine ear, To force from every loyal eye a tear, ‘Rush on the world, and, with unblushing face, Obscure the glories of the Brunswick race?’ Deceiv'd by thee, has dauntless Wardle dar'd To take the lordly Lion by the beard: Soon on his head the Demagogue shall draw (Or Justice sleeps) the thunder of his paw; And Folkstone, with his democratic pipe, Shall rue his rage, and gasp beneath his gripe. Sir Francis too will feel not soft rebuke, Though guarded by the sevenfold shield of Tooke: Patroclus' valiant self to hell was thrown, Though in th' immortal arms of Peleus' son. Nay, gifted with the swallow of a whale, Ev'n I, the Bard of Bards, believ'd thy tale; But now the phalanx of the Court I join, And see black forg'ry lurk in ev'ry line. Hark! Whitbread opens; all the Patriots cheer him: The walls re-echo, ‘Hear him, hear him, hear him!’ Charm'd with each word, to Whitbread's pow'rs they look, And mark in Fancy's eye a flying Duke. Thus, 'mid the wood when Snowball gives his tongue (Snowball, the truest of the tuneful throng), The peal begins, the sounds of rapture flow: ‘Hark, hark to Snowball! go to Snowball, go.’ Horns, hounds, and men, the hills with triumph stun; Sly Reynard now is seen upon the run. Now to the City let me turn mine eyes, Where foam the waves, and winds of discord rise. Fir'd by th' electric speech of Harvey Coombe, The Liv'ry-tribes with plaudits shake the room. Fir'd by the fuse of Waithman's elocution, With Babel tongues they thunder ‘Resolution;’ With Babel tongues insult the poor Lord Mayor, And put great Gog and Magog The two wooden Giants in Guildhall. on the stare. In vain he tries to tell a simple tale (For Sprats may sing Te Deum o'er a Whale): Regardless of gold chain, and pomp, and place, They howl him home, in sorrow and disgrace. Thus, when the Bird of Wisdom leaves his bow'r, O'er hills and valleys in broad day to tow'r; The small pert Tenants of the Hedge rush out, To put the solemn Trav'ller to the rout; Magpies, and Jays, and Ravens, Rooks and Crows, Spit in his face, and pull him by the nose: Unheard he hoots; the chattering, croaking train, Tumultuous, drive him to his hole again. Dear Delicacy, at thy shrine I bend; Oh, haste thee, Goddess, and our manners mend: A Gothic race to some refinement raise; For ev'n our Quality have dirty ways. Much like French Cooks; who, though in omlets great, Spit in the frying-pan to prove its heat; And, spreading rolls in winter (mode uncouth!), First warm the slice of butter in the mouth. Too prone are Mob to pull their Princes down, And smother with their greasy Hats a Crown. With hawk-like eye, they wait an evil hour To strike, and paralyze the arm of Pow'r: To hold a proud dominion o'er the Court; With sacred Freedom, like Napoleon, sport; Whose wanton rage has handcuff'd Europe's Kings, And put her Princes all in leading-strings.— Sad knaves, no gratitude their bosom warms; Forgot the glory of the Hero's arms: Forgot the hosts that bled beneath his lance, Who Britain sav'd, and curb'd the pride of France; And stripp'd, in spite of cold and stormy weather, The crowing Gallic Cock of every feather. Shall Tape-men, Snuff-men, and such servile fellows, Wild roaring, of Sedition blow the bellows? Shall Salt, and Fish, and Paper, low-bred crew, Instruct the Lord's Vicegerents what to do; Stop of an Orator the opening weazon, And banish Members without rhyme or reason?— How dare the rogues indulge the lawless riot? Ev'n let them gorge their turtle, and lie quiet. What is their province, but to eat and drink? How dare they have the impudence to think? Presuming Imps, that fancy a dull Cit Possesses sense and breeding, taste and wit, Like those bright Bucks that grace a birth-night ball, And sauntering lounge through Bond Street and Pall Mall! As well might Dogs, their sprawling legs that sport, Presume to dance a minuet at Court. The Man of Livery, matters rarely minces; Hear what the lev'ller says of foreign Princes: ‘Cross, cross the breed, degenerating fast, Or ouran outangs they must sink at last.’ Perchance, of Courts, too high we prize the scenes; The nods of Monarchs, and the dips of Queens: And fancy fools that claim the Royal eyes, In science deep, superlatively wise. Yet is a reverence due to dips and nods, Though not the gracious presents of the Gods. True; little folks, that Royalty behold, Are apt to think it of superior mould.— As through a lane a mighty Monarch past, A Village Maid her eyes of wonder cast Broad on the form that Courtiers all adore; (For Madge had never seen a King before.) The Girl, exclaiming, to her cottage ran: ‘Look, Mother! Mother, look! the King's a man!’— ‘When Nature forms a Prince, she culls with care The best materials for the Royal ware; But when a subject, careless, takes her broom, And makes him from the sweepings of the room.’ Such of Court-adulation is the song; But Flattery often oils a Courtier's tongue. ‘Try'd in the crucible of Truth, behold, The slander'd Youth shall come forth sterling Gold; While thou shalt shock our sight, a motley mass, A mixture vile of Brimstone and of Brass.’ Thus cry the Members of Administration, Whose heads contain the talents of the Nation. Hawkesb'ry and Castlereagh transcend all praise: And Canning is the wonder of our days; For though not French our Secretary speak, He thunders Latin, and Bœotian Greek; Frights with grand phrase the Plenipoes around; And, when he fails in sense, succeeds by sound: Like Esop's long-ear'd Animal, whose din Perform'd such wonders in the Lion's skin.— Such are the Pilots Heav'n has deign'd to form, To steer the old State Vessel through the Storm. At this, thou bidd'st the Bard and Verse go whistle: Then read, and tremble at, my next Epistle. A SECOND SOLEMN, SENTIMENTAL, AND REPROBATING, EPISTLE TO MRS. CLARKE. No longer now the Duke excites our wonder, 'Midst ‘gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuss, and thunder A line from Pope.;’ Amidst his hosts, no more with rapture dwells On Congreve's rockets, and on Shrapnell's shells; But quits, with scornful mein, the field of Mars, And to Sir David's genius leaves the wars. Now in dull Windsor-rides the Youth is seen; Now, in dull walks to Frogmore with the Queen; At Oatlands now, where pigs and poultry charm, Like Cincinnatus in his Sabine farm; Now o'er a lonely dish in Stable Yard, Without a Friend, and (strange!) without a card. Now, as the humour is disposed to vary, O'er melancholy tea with Mistress Cary; For invitation-dinners soon grow slack, When Fortune on a Favourite turns her back: Now, at tame Whist, with Lady Charlotte Finch, Who feels of sharp Economy the pinch; With other superannuated Souls, Who mourn, through winter drear, the loss of coals Coals, that important article of domestic felicity and convenience, have been for some time withdrawn from the Palace of St. James's on account of the scantiness of the Royal Finance; and the poor Pensioners obliged to send their Beef and Mutton to a Bakehouse.. How, few, of this our Money-scraping Isle, Whom Fortune favours, have deserv'd her smile! How few like Bosville, even of lofty quality, Expand the noble doors of hospitality; To sacred Friendship free libations pour, And give an age's pleasure to an hour; Yet, o'er the glass, can hear the Beggar's cry, And steal the tear from Misery's melting eye; Contemning gold, as splendid dross at best, That sleeping loads the half-starv'd Miser's chest! Give some all Mexico, they still are poor: Pour down their throats her Gulf, they pant for more. Enchantress, listen to the tale I tell. The men who venison to his Highness sell, Nay, ev'n poor pepper, vinegar, and mustard, Crumpets, and Yorkshire-cakes, and cream, and custard, To Heav'n their eyes of disappointment turning, Make a long face, and put their doors in mourning. The fierce Hussar, his soul inflam'd with ire, In sorrow, flings his whiskers in the fire. The turban'd Blacks no more their pomp display; But cast their cymbals, in their wrath, away. From all the ranks are heard the plaintive hums, And melancholy damps the muffled drums. The high Ambassador, with so much glee Who parted from his boots and shoes for thee, No more to Court-preferment turns his views, But turns reluctant to his boots and shoes; Hums o'r his lapstone tunes of doleful grace, Less with Morocco Morocco ambassador, was a punning appellation given by Mistress Clarke, perfectly tranquille before the great and awful Tribunal of the Nation, to Mister Tom Taylor, shoemaker in Bondstreet, and a favourite missionary of both parties. pleas'd than Gloucester Place. Such is thy pow'r; yet let me not conceal, But draw from dark futurity the veil. The hour, the splendid hour, is on the wing, When in proud triumph Wimbledon shall ring, Blackheath again shall lift her drooping head, And shouts of triumph fill the Park parade. Yes; shall the Hero to his rank return, While Hate shall foam in vain, and Envy burn; And, spite of thy poor fabricated story, Reblaze the Sun of Military Glory. 'Tis but a passing cloud obscures his ray; At most, the darkness of a short-liv'd day. The Bird of Jove, by an unlucky ball, May lose some feathers of his wings, and fall; Awhile may feed on snails, and hop the ground; Till Time renews his plumes, and cures his wound: Then, with new vigour imp'd, he mounts the wind, And leaves the groveling grubs of earth behind; Sublimely soars, scarce conscious of the blow, And darts disdain upon the world below. He comes, the Hero comes, in all his might; And, cloth'd with terror, puts his foes to flight. Thus, once I saw a Country Bull at ring, Break, in his rage, the rope, with sudden spring: Cobblers and Butchers, Taylors, fall or fly; While hats, caps, wigs, and aprons mount the sky; Sport of the winds, o'er trees and chimneys borne, That prov'd the prowess of his head and horn. Enchantress, yes, (for oracles I tell;) The Youth shall rise, and mock thy every spell; Stamp with eternal infamy thy name, Mock thy dark wiles, and cover thee with shame. Then heed the ticklish humours of the times: Though Justice loiter, she may catch thy crimes. In spite of those two fascinating eyes, The Youth in awful Majesty may rise; Lift his bold arm, that ev'n the Thunder dreads, And tear perhaps thy tender Form to shreds.— Thus have I seen with moralizing look, Cabbage and turnip-tops obstruct a brook: By calm degrees, up swells the crystal flood, Superior rising, not to be withstood; It bursts the boundary, with furious sweep, And whelming drowns the garbage in the deep. Perhaps thine heart creates a reformation! A tub for whales, in Wisdom's contemplation. What madness centres in that word ‘reform!’ Who would destroy a garden for a worm? Who, but a Bedlamite, would fire his house, To wreak his vengeance on a pilfering mouse? To use an humble simile, as pat; Beat in his scull, to crush a teazing gnat? Why banish charming Bribery from the Nation, Which gives that blessing Gold a circulation; Bids the bells ring; with spirits fires the Votes; Buys for their Wives new caps, and gowns, and coats; Gives consequence to Butchers, Taylors, Tanners; Finds for their Daughters Music and Court-manners; Inspires their hearts, to scorn with noble pride The clumsy cleaver, goose, and horrid hide; To nought but titled Lovers yield an ear, As Joans and Nans have won full many a Peer?— What beauteous Insects from corruption spring; Leave humble dirt, and sport the gilded wing! What Flowers of vivid hue, and rich perfume, To stable-litter owe their balm and bloom! If this my subject then I fairly handle; Be Counties, Boroughs, sold by inch of Candle. Grant that a few Commissions may be sold: Lo, mighty Marlborough gave up fame for gold! Grant that the Hero may, for once be wrong; Why sound his error with a trumpet-tongue? Take from Sir Joseph's book a leaf or two Sir Joseph Banks annually volunteers his services as grand puffer, or barker, at Ram-fair, held near the Pagoda, at Kew; from whence he sets off to Windsor, with the profits of the sale, for the benefit of his Royal Master.; Great Man, who makes his annual tour to Kew; With Christie's elocution puffs the Rams, With metaphoric splendour gilds the Dams: Hides rotten feet beneath the flowers of fame, And sends with credit off the blind and lame. Be censure silent on the Soldier's Fund: What is it?—a mere rill, at most a pond; How trifling, to the Treasury's boundless ocean!— Cheese-paring Windham, how d'ye like my notion? Let Ridicule enjoy, with hearty laugh, Commission'd boys, and striplings on the Staff: Ere long, may babes our Army List adorn; And, what may more astonish, babes unborn. Napoleon dares not seize our goods and chattels; We trust our safety to the God of Battles: Yet let me say, (nor will it be denied), Dame Fortune rarely joins the weakest side. Fair Sinner, ere I close shese solemn Rhymes, Receive a little comment on the times. Fanaticism, a tyrant, rules the hour: As Locusts thick, her Imps of frenzy pour; O'er Nature's smile diffuse a spectred gloom; And blast, with canker'd breath, her cheerful bloom: Saints who the Lord on sacred Sunday seek, And hand and glove with Satan pass the week; Who sigh for Heaven, yet God in Mammon see, And pick a pocket on the suppliant knee; One eye to God, lamenting moral evil; The other, winking down upon the Devil: One voice to Heaven, ‘To good my heart incline;’ And one in whispers, ‘Satan, I am thine:’ Maim busts and statues that display the nude, Yet clasp, in secret dalliance, flesh and blood; Load with anathemas the Comic Muse, And lead a wanton Laïs to the stews; Preach Heav'n-born Charity towards the Poor, And Dog-like bark the Beggar from the door; Preach sweet benevolence, and hang a Cat Whose famish'd stomach takes a simple sprat; Preach patience, and, with phrase too bad to utter, Knock down the Cook because she oils the butter: Fools who pretend Heaven's wondrous scheme to scan, And impious make th' Almighty less than man. Such is the modern apostolic race, Reform'd, regenerated rogues of grace New apostles are hourly multiplying. They are even rising from the Navy and Army, where one could not have expected an existence. At Camden Town, adjoining to the Metropolis, a set of New Apostles of a very humble sphere indeed have made their appearance: one Page, minister and chimney-sweep; one Francis, minister and cobbler; one Graham, minister and a lame beggar; and one Blackburn, better known by the name of Tommy the Goose, a horse-whipper of carpets, and clerk to the aforesaid most respectable Interpreters of the Gospel, and maestro di Capello (alias Proprietor) of a room called Camden Town Chapel, who lets out his ash chairs, joint stools, and crickets, to the children of the holy seed, drawing, like Saint Hill, Saint Huntington, Saint Frey, Saint Medley, and other celebrated Saints, a most comfortable subsistence from the pockets of Ignorance and Credulity. Saint Frey has lately undertaken the arduous, yet lucrative, labour of converting Jews to Christianity. Strongly suspecting the purity of the motive for this Herculean labour, the Poet has expressed his sentiments in the subsequent lines:— Religions form a thriving trade; Nice tools, by knaves for Mammon made. Saint Frey, with Christian-like exertion, Well fills his fob by Jew-conversion: Place more emolument in view, Saint Frey becomes a sterling Jew; Unblushing, feels the World's derision; Sells Christ, and suffers circumcision.. The rage of those apostles thou wilt rue: Those Gospel Bloodhounds will thy paths pursue; And hunt thee to the bed of lawless blisses, Perhaps to Wardle yielding balmy kisses. Perchance with other Dukes thou may'st be tripping: Dread then a sheet, a Bridewell, or a whipping; For limbs like thine (if true be Rumour's tale) Suit bonds of Venus better than a jail. Yes, those apostles will thy wanderings watch; And, should their art thy vagrant beauty catch, In vain Repentance pours her doleful yell; For Mercy knows not where the Impostors dwell. Like David, with whose works we're well acquainted, Our modern Saints declare they have repented; And, since the vigour of their youth is lost, And catch and glee have yielded up the ghost, ‘Be joyful in the Lord’ is on their tongue, ‘And come before his presence with a song.’ The man whose soul the blacker vices taint, Now, for Heaven's glory, makes a damn'd good Saint: Thus Heads of Whitings, graced with modest light, Stink first, and then illuminate the night. Such are the saints that bless our ears and eyes: Speak, Wilberforce, if I am forging lies. Here ends my Satire.—Should my Sovereign smile, Admire my loyalty, applaud my style; And, knowing well a Poet's empty dishes, Say thus, ‘Let Peter share our Loaves and Fishes;’ By Heavens, in honour of his high commands, I'll steal a coat, or borrow, to kiss hands: For, unlike Bishops The ‘No-lo episcopari’ of our Bishops is still proverbial; and pronounced on every creation, with all the evangelical solemnity of a Custom-house oath., 'tis my firm intention To cry out, ‘Yes, my Liege,’ for Place or Pension. CARLTON-HOUSE FETE; OR, THE DISAPPOINTED BARD; IN A SERIES OF ELEGIES: TO WHICH IS ADDED, CURIOSITY IN RAGS; AN ELEGY. ? Hinc illæ lacrymæ! Yet to provoke and mortify me more, (Scarce crediting my two astonish'd ears Yarmouth and Bloomfield sent of cards a score, Inviting dead folks; dead, ah! dead for years. Elegy II. ELEGY I. The Poet lamenteth, in the Strain of the Son of Jesse, his hard Fate, but not quite destitute of Hope.—In the Language of Music, follows a long String of sharps in a Key illustrating the Subject, and displaying the Fertility of the Poet's Imagination.—Great Expectation on Account of Honour conferred on Mr. Sheridan.—The Poet's Humility in wishing even to be seated with the degraded Commons of England, upon the Grass in the Garden, under Canvass. In grief, I sat upon the bank of Thame; (But not, thank God, a captive, like the Jews “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.”—Psalm CXXXVII.;) And when the Jubilee During which the unfortunate Bard remained entirely unnoticed. to memory came, Tears burst in torrents from my Lady Muse. Yet, lo, one beam, one solitary ray, Pierc'd the dark cloud that wrapp'd my sandy seat; A great, sublime, a wonderful display Of Eastern Grandeur at the Prince's Fête. “Here,” said I to myself, “I build some hope, (Perchance a slight foundation, rather rotten:) No longer doom'd in solitude to mope, At Carlton Fête I may not be forgotten.” Sharp as a pining Maid expects the Post, That brings epistle full of lovesick sighs; Or as the Dog in seeming slumber lost, Who slily winks, to snap the teasing flies:— Sharp as, amid the fields of air, a Kite, In hopes of feasting on a barn-door fowl; Or as for mice, amid the dusky night, O'er hill and dale the solitary Owl:— Sharp as a Bailiff for a hiding debtor; Or as the hard Churchwarden on the poor; Or bilious Critic on a word, or letter, To scalp his victim author o'er and o'er: Sharp as an Epicure upon the haunch, His two eyes jealous of the favourite fat; Or on the turtle, to enlarge his paunch With thrice the quantity would fill a hat: Sharp as the Bank upon a doubtful note; Or hungry Frenchmen for a limb of frog; Or Borough-monger for a casting vote, Intent to sell poor Freedom like a Hog: Sharp as a trading justice for a bible, To give the oath, no matter false or true; Or dread Sir Vinegar to seize a libel, And strike th' offending dog with vengeance due:— Sharp as Sir Vinegar, who look'd in vain To shove his bottom into Mansfield's place; Or as Jack Ketch surveys the felon train, In hope of necks to meet his rope's embrace:— Sharp as Lord Puzzle for his office-fee, To keep his poverty-struck house, so poor; Where none my Lord and Lady Puzzle see, Save keen Economy, who bolts the door:— Sharp as our Alexander, gallant York, Look'd out for poor Sir David's resignation; Who now (for merit miracles can work) O'er Slander triumphs, and resumes his station:— Sharp as Marcellus for the rapturous hour That yields the Dame whom every charm adorn; When kind Cornutus takes his prudent tour, And calmly in his pocket puts his horns: Exulting thus, in language rather coarse; “What's wife to honours?—stuff, beneath my care: Make me, ye Gods, but Master of the Horse, The Devil may be the master of my mare;” So sharp I listen'd, yea, with full-stretch'd ear, To every knock, no matter soft or hard; At once, in Fancy's eye, I saw appear A Royal compliment to me the Bard. Said I, “If Sheridan a favourite be, The moral Mentor of the Princely mind; Some compliment will come to moral me: The Lyric moralist must favour find.” Yes, to myself I whisper'd (not in joke), “At Carlton House I sure shall eat, and quaff; Although not cheek by jowl with Royal folk, Yet under canvass with the common raff:”— Raff that we Britons with our freedom trust, Yet now consider'd as mere reptile things; Raff that can form a Monarch from the dust; Raff that confers a Majesty on Kings. ELEGY II. A most pathetic Question.—The Poet's heavy Complaint.—Mr. Weltjie passeth high Panegyric on the Bard—knoweth his Poetry by heart—inviteth the Bard to Dinner—a broad hint to certain Princes.—Mr. Weltjie wisheth the Bard to be his Biographer, proudly insinuating that his Life would be a more interesting morceau to the Public than the exalted Life of Colonel Hanger—intimateth a Desire of the Prince to peruse the Poet's delectable Effusions.—Great Character given by Mr. Weltjie of his Royal Master.—The Poet again, in the sublime Strain of the Royal Psalmist, voweth Acts of Gratitude to the Memory of his old departed Friend Weltjie. In sackcloth still and ashes must I weep? Yes, in his solitude the Poet mourns, Gold fills the House of Carlton, what a heap! But not to him the Age of Gold returns. No, not one grain of favour have I found; Nor seen indeed the shadow of a card: Thus are my sanguine hopes all wreck'd, and drown'd; Such for my loyalty the rare reward! Yet to provoke and mortify me more, (Scarce crediting my two astonish'd ears,) Yarmouth and Bloomfield sent at least a score, Inviting dead folks This was literally done by those two Ministers appointed to the card department; who seem on this occasion to have acted in diametrical opposition to the old adage, which says, “A living Dog is better than a dead Lion.” One would imagine that the noble Lord, and the brave and experienced Colonel, were put sadly to their trumps for want of a complete company, by being forced to beat up for volunteers among the tombs.; dead, ah! dead for years. How often Weltjie to my flatter'd ear Hath said, and given my heart sweet palpitation: “Docter, I tell you vhat: by Gote, I swear You be de bestest Poet in de nation. “I likes your Louziad; oh, dam pretty ting; I laughs to zee you vling about your squibs: An den de Apple Dumplins an de King; Mine Gote, I laughs until I breaks my ribs. “Den Vhitbread Brewhouse, an poor Passon Yong; Docter, I can remember dem by rote: And Docter, minds, I neffer tells you vrong; De Deffil take me, all be true by Gote.” How often has he said, “Come come, an dine (I knows you love good eating) pon a buck: An den I gif you dam goot glass of vine; I gif you too one roast anchovy Muscovy. duck. “Den, Docter, you muss taste my pretty pork; Bester dan oder peeple pork by half: I knows dat you will play goot knive an vork; An mind, I zuckles de yong pigs myzelf. “Den after dinner you sal taste my vruit: I gif you for to eat zome nice umbrellas; Dere's in my gardin zome dat's defflish goot:”— Kind Weltjie simply meaning, his morellas Delighted with my Lyric Lucubration; Fond of the Poet, and the Poet's name; Such was the generous German's invitation.— Blush, Princes, that ye have not done the same. How oft he ask'd me, “Vil you vrite my Life, An vrite me zometing comikal in rhyme? But dont zay not a vord about my Vife. Mine beat George Hanger Life ten touzand time. “But, Docter, zend de Prince your Vesses, pray; He vish to have dem in de mornin early: He tink you too great Poet of de day; He love your funning, now I tell shinsherely. “Now, Docter, zoon you zomething goot vil zee; I knows de Prince do zometing goot intend: Den zend His Royal Highness rhyme by me; De Prince he neffer do forget old vriend.” King of the Cooks, once of Pall Mall the glory; No matter where thy birth, or who begat thee; Pleas'd with thy broken English, and quaint story, With thee I oft have laugh'd, and sometimes at thee. Peace to thy shade, O Weltjie! Many an hour, In Pall Mall, Hammersmith, and Turnham Green, My soul has felt thy fascinating pow'r, That from the gloomiest heart could chase the spleen. Yes, Weltjie, thou shalt gild the page of Fame: For thee, the Muse shall draw the teeth of Time; Th' insatiate Tyrant shall not eat thy name: Such are the powers of Rhyme, immortal Rhyme. O Weltjie, to all parties so well known; So great thy talents, what a burning shame The Red Book, the Court Calendar alone, Should give posterity a simple name! Companion thou of Princes and of Peers, Of Baronets and Knights the constant crony: Thou by thy converse oft didst charm their ears; And, what delighted more, didst lend them money. If I forget thee, Weltjie “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand foget her cunning.” Psalm cxxxvii., and thy dinner; Thy tales of palaces, thy wit, thy punning; May Fame proclaim me an ungrateful sinner, And this my fiddle-hand forget her cunning. Yes, Weltjie: if thy Ghost unhappy roam, Because I've not fulfill'd my just devoirs; Believe me, I will satisfy thy tomb, And give the gossip Public thy Memoirs. ELEGY III. The Lucubrations of the Poet are carried to Carlton-House, but produce no remuneration.—History of Bards of old Times.—The Poet boasteth of the high Powers of his Muse and Harp, had they been invited to the Fête.—A natural Suggestion relative to the Ghost of Kien Long.—The presumed Generosity of Mr. Perceval.—A pretty Comparison between Ministers in general, and a Birch Rod.—A further Boast of Powers of the Harp and Song.—The Cruelty of Oblivion. Elate, to Carlton-House my Rhymes I sent, Before the Poem met the public eye: Which gain'd applause, the Poet's great intent; But nought besides, I say it with a sigh. Strange, that the Prince forgot my Song and Lyre, Whose taste in music is so very pretty; Whose touches on the Bass possess a fire, Surpass'd alone by Crossdill and Cervetti. Yet, dare I say a Prince can be surpast; Excell'd by groveling subjects, herd unclean? Is it not blasphemy, to boast a taste To rival that of Prince, or King, and Queen? In days of yore, Bards ate and drank with Kings; Courted, caress'd, invited to each rout: Are modern Bards such sad degenerate things, That I and my poor Harp were both kept out? As scenes sublime demand a strain sublime, How had I call'd upon the Muse of Fire! How had I summon'd all the powers of Rhyme, And wak'd the loudest thunder of the Lyre! Sounds that had travell'd ocean, reach'd Pekin: The present Emperor's ear had caught the Song; The Verse had ravish'd every Mandarin, And sooth'd the shade of Brother-Bard Kien Long. Who knows but that the good old Monarch's Ghost Assumed behind the Regent's chair a station; Pleased with the lustre of the scene, and cost!— The cost? Poh, poh! a fleabite to the Nation. This Perceval will pay, and with a grace. Old England weak! her Treasury's a Giant: Besides, if Ministers will keep their place, Like Rods they merit, they must all be pliant. Are there deficiencs of Civil List, Works of high wisdom that expence demand; With much humility the Throne is kiss'd, The Budget gapes, and Taxes load the land. Yes: raptured had I struck the harp of Fame, And sung the splendid beauties of the Fête; Described each dress, immortaliz'd each name, And given Posterity th' illustrious treat:— Sung boiling Gudgeons These humble representatives of fishes of gold, were, by the heat of the lamps, chandeliers, and the good company, completely boiled, and fit for dishing up; and, instead of exhibiting their intended sportive recreations, were seen floating in a melancholy and lifeless posture, between the tin banks, on the watery element., given for Fish of Gold; In streams that through the table should have play'd: Superior to th' Arabian Nights of old; Surpassing all that has been sung or said. How had these mounted on the wings of Ode, As much of fame the Lyric Muse bestows! Now, like a Worm along the humble Sod, They crawl through Newspapers in languid prose. Ode is a Sun that undecaying shines; A Giant, placing mortals 'midst the Gods: The brain that owns it, boasts the gem-clad mines; Ev'n Kings have gain'd celebrity from Odes. Raptur'd I too had sung Britannia's boast, The polish'd converse of the Heir Apparent.— Good Heav'n, what valuable things are lost, As Horace mourneth, quia Vate carent! Oblivion, that sly mute, that creeping jade, (As pleas'd to drown a wise man as a fool,) Is ever busy at her secret trade, To sink a name or virtue in a pool. ELEGY IV. The Poet lamenteth the Omission of certain interesting Exhibitions that might have afforded Pleasure in Pastry to the Multitude. What pity that no wash-tub did appear, To show Trafalgar's Battle, and the Nile's; With pretty little paper ships of war, To launch the thunder of the Queen of Isles! What pity there was not a baker's tray, With troops of gingerbread upon the plain; Horse, Foot, engag'd, and spreading dire dismay, And cutting, thick as Hops, the French in twain! Sure, gingerbread might well portray a scene, A Duke's full levee after scenes of woe; A Duke in converse with his gallant men, And smiling upon Greenwood, Cox, and Co. What pity, gingerbread did not display Our British hero from his chariot flung; Hurl'd from the regions of celestial day, A second Phaeton, to mud and dung:— Now nobly scrambling on his legs again, 'Midst gazing armies, and a mighty shout; The reins resuming with a just disdain, And scornful kicking dull Sir David out! How far superior to a China view; Where neither genius, taste, nor fancy, dwells: Monkeys and mandarins, a motley crew, Bridges, pagodas, swings, and tinkling bells! Yet let us not of such a scene despair: Some pastry-cook the miracle may bake; The Royal Duke, Sir David, and the Car, All nicely mounted on a nice twelfth cake. ELEGY V. A most solemn and pathetic Address to the Muse—The Poet recounteth the Princely Honours paid to him in past Times, with a most deplorable Contrast of the present Day. Muse, sing the reason why I was omitted: Was it that Dame Fitzherbert prov'd my theme; In favour once, who, flatter'd and bedittied, Of Crowns and Sceptres dar'd indulge the dream? Was it because I touch'd the string of praise To Her whose heart ev'n Envy must revere? Was it because I wish'd her happier days; And from the lid of grief to steal the tear?— There was a time, a nod would bless mine eyes: There was a time, I gain'd a gracious smile. My nose was, like my garret, in the skies: ‘My room,’ I cried, ‘will flow with wine and oil.’ So sweet a Prince's smile, sublime his nod, We scarce can fancy vulgar earth could mould him. Gull'd man who gains them! he becomes a God: Saint Paul's is scarcely large enough to hold him. Too soon my buds of hope resign'd their bloom; Too soon the gloom of disappointment mine Oil, not a spoonful, flow'd into my room; No, nor a piteous nipperkin of wine. Ah! no; I found no meaning in the nod: Ah! no; no meaning in the gracious smile: In vain, with consequence the ground I trod; Like Homer's Neptune, striding many a mile. For Fortune therefore I must longer wait; Hang on the willows my mute Harp ‘We hanged our harps upon the willows,’ &amp;c. Psalm cxxxvii.; and fear That, if I hung myself, my hapless fate Would scarcely force from Carlton-House a tear. CURIOSITY IN RAGS. Curiosity depicted—Lamentable Confusion at Carlton-House during the Exhibition after the Grand Fête—A sublime naval Comparison—Fortitude of the Ladies—A Compliment to the undaunted courage of Lord Yarmouth and Colonel Bloomfield—An Address to the Muse—A circumstantial Account of the Ladies' Progress in their vulgar and penitential Robes, from Carlton-House to their respective Habitations—A short and decent prayer for his Royal Highness. What evils Curiosity produceth! Yet nothing can the madding rage restrain: Whate'er the danger, not a Nymph refuseth; Though Death frown'd near, to cut her form in twain. Vain were the efforts of a Milton's pen, That paints a diabolic rout so well, To give with truth the horrors of the scene; Such squeezing, swearing, tearing, squeak, and yell. Ah me, what petticoats were lost, and torn; Pathetic subject for the mournful Muse, Gowns and pelisses felt a state forlorn; Baskets of bonnets, and whole tubs of shoes. The golden chain forsook the bosom's charms, With many a necklace form'd of pearls and beads: Bracelets deserted from their taper arms, And wigs in tatters left their lovely heads. Thus at the glorious struggle of the Nile, On which our British hist'ry justly brags; Yard-arm and yard-arm meeting, (dread turmoil!) The sails and rigging were reduc'd to rags. Regardless of their Backs, amidst the squeeze; As Velvet soft, and fair as Alpine Snow; The kallipuge Character given by the polite Athenians to one of their plump Venuses. charms, the legs, and knees; They urge their dang'rous way to see the show. Their limbs so delicate, and skin so white, And then their swelling bosoms all so bare, Fix'd (for what youth could wink on such a sight?) Fix'd ev'ry orb of vision on the stare. Yes: ev'n with common decency to war, Did novelty their gentle bosoms harden; For soon indeed were numbers of the Fair, Like Mother Eve when ent'ring Eden's garden. Yet if the mother of the World could err, (For in his trap old Satan surely caught her,) We should not therefore make a mighty stir; But yield to mercy and forgive the daughter. Yet let me sing in thunder of applause, How Yarmouth, Bloomfield, not a fear betray'd; But through the windows, stripp'd of all their gauze And muslins, lugg'd full many a fainting Maid. Now, if you please, my Lady Muse, relate What did the Nymphs who all their vestments lost; As many a Nymph, the lean as well as fat, Saw not the sight, by cruel Fortune crost. Forc'd to their homes unwilling to depart, They stalk'd forlorn along the grinning streets, Deep-blushing, loaded with a heavy heart, Huddled in aprons, table-cloths, and sheets. Yea, verily, the Nymphs were forc'd to roam; Yea, left by sad misfortune in the lurch; In sorrow, all bare-headed, to their home, As though they had done penance in a church.— Such was the scene, with which no scene compares; And long indeed will Dame and Damsel rue it: Such was the piteous posture of affairs; Pray God, the modest Regent did not view it!</field>
