By that cottage near a wood I often stood alone In sad or happy mood, And wished she was my own. The birds kept sweetly singing, But nature pleased in vain; For the dark and lovely maiden I never saw again. By the cottage near the wood I wished in peace to be: The blossoms where she stood Were more than gems to me. More fair or sweeter blossoms My rambles sought in vain; But the dark and lovely maiden I never found again. By that cottage near a wood The children held her gown, And on the turf before her Ran laughing up and down. They played around her beauty, While I sought joys in vain; She fled—the lovely maiden I could not find again. By that cottage near the wood, Where children used to play, Spring often burst the bud, And as often passed away. And with them passed my visions Of her whom I adore; For the dark and lovely maiden, I love her evermore.’ OVERLAND MONTHLY THE PANSY It does me good, thou flower of spring, Thy blossoms to behold; Thou bloom'st when birds begin to sing, In purple and in gold. Along the garden-beds so neat Thy flowers their blooms display, When sparrows chirp and lambkins bleat And hopes look up for May. Then Emma thinks the heart's-ease blooms When she the pansy sees; But I see sleep among the tombs, With heart that's ill at ease, That asks for what it's lost and loved— A quiet home and friends, Where nature's feelings were approved And peace made life amends; Where love was all I had to sing, And there these pansy flowers Came shining in the dews of spring To cheer the sunny hours. But years may pass, as they have passed, And I may hope in vain, With hopes that linger to the last, To see them bloom again. The fairest flower that ever bloomed, Or garden ever blest, Looks cold to care, and ne'er was doomed To ease the heart's unrest. The heart's-ease in her happy hour Might Emma's fancy please, But life will often pluck the flower And feel but ill at ease. SONG ON TOBACCO Some sing about love in their season of roses, But love has in sorrow no blossoms to wear; So I'll sing tobacco, that cheers and composes, And lulls us asleep in our trouble and care. So here's to tobacco, the Indian weed, The peaceful companion through trouble and strife; May it prove every smoker's best friend in his need, And be to his heart a restorer through life. There's the husbandman hourly tormented with care, By his daily companion, a troublesome wife; But a pipe of tobacco will soothe his despair, And bring him sunshine in the shadows of life. Then here's to tobacco, the Indian weed, May it bless honest smokers with peace to the end, For such a companion is friendship indeed, Since it proves in the midst of all trouble a friend. The statesman, the lawyer, the parson will find, When business oppresses and sorrow grows ripe, To steer clear of follies and strengthen the mind, There's nothing like leisure and smoking a pipe. So here's to that cheering tobacco once more; May each honest smoker prove blest with the weed, May it mend broken hopes and lost pleasures restore, And always prove dear as a friend in his need. [Beautiful woman, visions dwell] Beautiful woman, visions dwell Of heaven's joy about thee, And every step I take is hell That walks thro' life without thee. [When with our little ones we spent] When with our little ones we spent Each Sunday after tea, And up the wood's dark side we went Or pasture's rushy lea, To look among the woodland boughs To find the bird's retreat, Or crop the cowslip for the cows; Then sat to rest the little feet In many a pleasant place, And see the lambs, who tried to bleat, Come first in every race, Then laugh'd the children's joys to view, Who ran across the lea At birds that from the rushes flew, And many a wandering bee. [You promised me, a year ago] COLIN You promised me, a year ago, When autumn bleach'd the mistletoe, That you and I should be as one; But now another autumn's gone— Its solemn knell is in the blast, And love's bright sun is overcast; Yet flowers will bloom and birds will sing, And e'en the winter claim the spring. LUCY The hedges will be green again, And flowers will come on hill and plain; And though we meet a rainy day, The hawthorn will be white with May. If love and nature still agree, Green leaves will clothe the trysting-tree; And when these pleasing days you view, Think Lucy's heart yet be true. [Sweeter than roses was the face] Sweeter than roses was the face For whom I pluck'd the flower; Sweeter than heaven was the place In that delightful hour. [Tis autumn now &amp; harvests reign] Tis autumn now &amp; harvests reign Brown swelling hills &amp; hollow vales The sudden shower sweeps oer the plain &amp; health breaths in the shivering gales The coveys rise—the sportsman joys &amp; in the stubbles bleeding fall The hunters face glows in the chase He loves to hear the bugle call That loud through wood &amp; dingle rings As oer the fence the courser springs The songs of home in every field From merry harvesters is heard The hare as yet from harm will shield Where barley waves its tawney beard Some sing &amp; blink oer kegs of drink &amp; love the drunkards brawls to own— I love to dream by valleys stream &amp; live with quiet peace alone The brook &amp; wood the vale &amp; tree Are the green homes of joy to me Some love to drink adieu to care I love the solitude of rest Some meet with woman false &amp; fair &amp; think it joy to be distrest The hazle nook the mossy brook I love from feelings of the boy The broad topt oak the ravens croak &amp; all of nature brings me joy There solitude of sun &amp; shade A paradise on earth hath made &amp; yet the love of woman still Hath been my sunshine all along Her voice along the upland hill Was music in my early song Her love confest is still the best To comfort every care &amp; thrall In poesys page her heritage Reigns still the empress over all Theres not a land where life hath been But looks on woman as its queen [I long to forget them—the love of my life—] I long to forget them—the love of my life— To forget them, and keep this lorn being my own; The honey is cell'd in such changeable strife, I long to keep sorrow and trouble my own— To live in myself, and to be what I am, And to leave earth's delusions and shadows behind, Where love may not cheat, nor its happiness damn: The shadows of hope I with nature may find. O, bear me away from this changeable strife, To the childhood of nature, the linnet and bee! Let her flowers be my children, her freedom my wife, Where God, my Creator, is constant and free. The flower on the white bush, the nest in the ground, Which my own happy childhood once shouted to find; Let me live in those scenes, with the wind blowing round, And I shall be happy to bear it in mind, To think of the joys of that once-happy spot Where I lived with my children the whole summer long— The mother, the garden, the books and the cot, The theme and affection of many a song. The snowdrop and crocus are first in the year, And there the tall foxglove its red-freckled bell To the summer and bee was delicious and dear; And down in the homestead, the pond and the dell Would hide me an hour in its hazel so green, While the world and its troubles kept far, far away; And there silent solitude kept me unseen, With love-ties around me the whole of the day. And there was the robin, perch'd on the ash tree, Would sing me a tune, and then drop for a worm; And there the coy thrush my companion would be, While the hazel-bush sheltered my seat from a storm. And there came the linnet, with wool in its bill, To build its new nest in the hedge or the thorn; And there I could see the black sails of the mill, And the spire in the gray, sleeping light of the morn. And there came the heavy-wing'd kite o'er the lea, And the old hens they call'd for their chickens aloud; And there the black crow came and perch'd on the tree, And the lark hid itself in the black-bosom'd cloud. O, bear me away from this tumult and strife Where woman or falsehood is not to be found— To the scenes which I loved in the childhood of life, In the fields which the thorn-hedges sheltered around; Where trees without order in spinney clumps stand, And in corners the aged or the whattled sheep pen; O bear me to those dearest spots in the land, And the peace of my lowly thatch'd cottage again! ENGLISH JOURNAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE I LOVE to hear the Nightingale— She comes where Summer dwells— Among the brakes and orchis flowers, And foxglove's freckled bells. Where mugwort grows like mignonette, And molehills swarm with ling; She hides among the greener May, And sings her love to Spring. I hear her in the Forest Beach, When beautiful and new; Where cow-boys hunt the glossy leaf, Where falls the honey-dew. Where brambles keep the waters cool For half the Summer long; The maiden sets her pitcher down, And stops to hear the song. The redcap is a painted bird, And sings about the town; The Nightingale sings all the eve, In sober suit of brown. I knew the sparrow could not sing; And heard the stranger long: I could not think so plain a bird Could sing so fine a song. I found her nest of oaken leaves, And eggs of paler brown, Where none would ever look for nests, Or pull the sedges down. I found them on a whitethorn root, And in the woodland hedge, All in a low and stumpy bush, Half hid among the sedge. I love the Poet of the Woods, And love to hear her sing,— That, with the cuckoo, brings the love And music of the Spring. Man goes by art to foreign lands, With shipwreck and decay; Birds go with Nature for their guide, And GOD directs their way— GOD of a thousand worlds on high!— Proud men may lord and dare; POWER tells them that the meaner things Are worthy of HIS care. [MAID of Walkherd, meet again] MAID of Walkherd, meet again, By the wilding in the glen; By the oak against the door, Where we often met before. By thy bosom's heaving snow, By thy fondness none shall know; Maid of Walkherd, meet again, By the wilding in the glen. By thy hand of slender make, By thy love I'll ne'er forsake, By thy heart I'll ne'er betray, Let me kiss thy fears away! I will live and love thee ever, Leave thee and forsake thee never! Though far in other lands to be, Yet never far from love and thee. SIGHING FOR RETIREMENT O TAKE me from the busy crowd, I cannot bear the noise! For Nature's voice is never loud; I seek for quiet joys. The book I love is everywhere, And not in idle words; The book I love is known to all, And better lore affords. The book I love is everywhere, And every place the same; GOD bade me make my dwelling there, And look for better fame. I never feared the critic's pen, To live by my renown; I found the poems in the fields, And only wrote them down. And quiet Epping pleases well, Where Nature's love delays; I joy to see the quiet place, And wait for better days. I love to seek the brakes and fern, And rabbits up and down; And then the pleasant Autumn comes, And turns them all to brown. To common eyes they only seem A desert waste and drear; To taste and love they always shine, A garden through the year. LORD keep my love for quiet joys, Oh, keep me to thy will! I know THY works, and always find THY mercies kinder still! THE FOREST MAID I love to see the forest maid Go in the pleasant day, And jump to break an idle bough, To drive the flies away. Her face is brown with open air, And like the lily blooming; But beauty, whether brown or fair, Is always found with women! She stoop'd to tie her pattens up, And show'd a cleanly stocking; The flowers made curtsies all the way, Against her ancles knocking. She stoop'd to get the foxglove bells That grew among the bushes, And, careless, set her basket down, And tied them up with rushes. Her face was ever in a smile, And brown, and softly blooming;— I often met the scorn of man, But welcome lives with woman! ON THE NEGLECT OF TRUE MERIT FASHION and Folly always follow Fame, Which Merit, slowly paced, is slow to claim. The gaudy and the mean men love to praise, But quiet Merit lives for other days. There's pleasant CRUIKSHANK, hearty RIPPINGILLE, And quiet HILTON, of diviner skill; There's simple ETTY, never vain or proud, Are left as common men among the crowd: But Fame keeps watch and looks for other days, And Merit claims for them diviner praise; The others left behind have nought to claim, And Merit wonders how they got to Fame; For Merit still will live above the mean, And CRUIKSHANK is what HOGARTH would have been. THE SEQUEL TO JOHN BARLEYCORN WHEN saucy Ale and I were young, I told him to his face, I'd put the tyrant in a song, And bring him to disgrace. But he would always give the lie, And always bade me note; He'd ever keep my pocket dry, And leave me scarce a groat. And when I blew his froth away, He vowed he'd make me rue; I tried to beat him every year, But sure he said the true. The coat had scarce a bit to own, The hat was bare and brown, All torn and open at the top, Like pot-lid hanging down. The maiden laughed, and well she might, To see me brought so low; And when I could not bear my plight, I scarce had leg to go. And when I gave him all I had, He served me all the worse; I lacked the friend who then might say— ‘Keep something in your purse.’ The scarecrow had a better hat, Which cost but half a-crown; And when I looked for Beauty's smile, I only got her frown. She turned her nose up at the coat, With ‘Go, you drunkard, go!’ I found, while Ale was still a friend, In each beside a foe. He often bade me string my purse, I tried to bear the jest; I got a wife, I could not spend, And bade him do his best. He laughed at all the books I got To while the night along; He called them all but silly stuff, And lit his pipe with song! I waited like the trampled grass, That might look up in spring; I tried and got a better coat: Now let him laugh and sing! He ground me on, he kept me down, And made me no amends; I tried, and found the sober truth, That robbers are no friends! A WALK IN THE FOREST I LOVE the Forest and its airy bounds, Where friendly CAMPBELL takes his daily rounds; I love the break neck hills, that headlong go, And leave me high, and half the world below; I love to see the Beach Hill mounting high, The brook without a bridge, and nearly dry. There's Bucket's Hill, a place of furze and clouds, Which evening in a golden blaze enshrouds: I hear the cows go home with tinkling bell, And see the woodman in the forest dwell, Whose dog runs eager where the rabbit's gone; He eats the grass, then kicks and hurries on; Then scrapes for hoarded bone, and tries to play, And barks at larger dogs and runs away. TO WORDSWORTH WORDSWORTH I love; his books are like the fields, Not filled with flowers, but works of human kind; The pleasant weed a fragrant pleasure yields, The briar and broomwood shaken by the wind, The thorn and bramble o'er the water shoot A finer flower than gardens e'er give birth, The aged huntsman grubbing up the root— I love them all as tenants of the earth: Where genius is, there often die the seeds; What critics throw away I love the more; I love to stoop and look among the weeds, To find a flower I never knew before: WORDSWORTH go on—a greater poet be, Merit will live, though parties disagree! THE WATER LILIES THE Water Lilies, white and yellow flowers, How beautiful they are upon the lake! I've stood and looked upon the place for hours, And thought how fine a garden they would make. The pleasant leaves upon the water float; The dragon-fly would come and stay for hours, And when the water pushed the pleasure boat, Would find a safer place among the flowers: They lay like Pleasure in a quiet place, Close where the moor-hen loved her nest to make,— They lay like beauty with a smiling face, And I have called them ‘Ladies of the Lake!’ I've brought the longest pole and stood for hours, And tried for years, before I got those flowers! THE FRIGHTENED PLOUGHMAN I WENT in the fields with the leisure I got, The stranger might smile, but I heeded him not; The hovel was ready to screen from a shower, And the book in my pocket was read in an hour. The bird came for shelter, but soon flew away; The horse came to look, and seemed happy to stay; He stood up in quiet, and hung down his head, And seemed to be hearing the poem I read. The ploughman would turn from his plough in the day, And wonder what being had come in his way, To lie on a molehill, and read the day long, And laugh out aloud when he finished his song. The peewit turned over and stooped o'er my head, Where the raven croaked loud, like the ploughman ill-bred, But the lark high above charmed me all the day long, So I sat down and joined in the chorus of song. The foolhardy ploughman I well could endure, His praise was worth nothing, his censure was poor; Fame bade me go on, and I toiled the day long, Till the fields where he lived should be known in my song. A WALK ON HIGH BEACH, LOUGHTON I LOVED the Forest walks and beechen woods, Where pleasant STOCKDALE showed me far away Wild Enfield Chase, and pleasant Edmonton; While Giant London, known to all the world, Was nothing but a guess among the trees, Though only half a day from where we stood. Such is ambition! only great at home, And hardly known to quiet and repose. I loved the Forest walk, and often stood To hear boys halloo to their wilder sheep; While quiet TURNER sat upon a hill, And gentle HOWARD cut his sticks and sang. The Sticker trailed her faggot on the ground, And all the Forest seemed to live with joy. LONDON VERSUS EPPING FOREST THE brakes, like young stag's horns, come up in Spring, And hide the rabbit holes and fox's den; They crowd about the forest everywhere; The ling and holly-bush, and woods of beach, With room enough to walk and search for flowers; Then look away and see the Kentish heights. Nature is lofty in her better mood, She leaves the world and greatness all behind; Thus London, like a shrub among the hills, Lies hid and lower than the bushes here. I could not bear to see the tearing plough Root up and steal the Forest from the poor, But leave to freedom all she loves, untamed, The Forest walk enjoyed and loved by all! GREATNESS OF MIND GREAT men are always kind, however rare, And more like common men than others are; The poor man saw the King and wondered on, To find him only like his neighbour JOHN: Greatness will live with Kindness everywhere; The sun shines brighter when the days are clear; Time mellows fruit, and suns bring on the flowers, And Greatness lives with Kindness in all hours: Fame makes them giants with her idle praise, Though common men at home, like common days: But Pride is ever low, and will deride; It nothing knows, for Ignorance is Pride. Pride would be great, but Folly laughs aloud, And Pride sinks down to nothing in the crowd. THE GIPSY CAMP THE snow falls deep; the Forest lies alone: The boy goes hasty for his load of brakes, Then thinks upon the fire and hurries back; The Gipsy knocks his hands and tucks them up, And seeks his squalid camp, half hid in snow, Beneath the oak, which breaks away the wind, And bushes close, with snow like hovel warm: There stinking mutton roasts upon the coals, And the half-roasted dog squats close and rubs, Then feels the heat too strong and goes aloof; He watches well, but none a bit can spare, And vainly waits the morsel thrown away: 'Tis thus they live—a picture to the place; A quiet, pilfering, unprotected race. THE TRUE SPIRITUAL WORSHIP GOD lives alone in quiet thoughts, And not in empty fears; The idle rave and noise aloud— GOD never interferes. The Prophet heard the noisy storm— The quiet ne'er despair— The Prophet heard the thunder loud, But GOD was never there. The Prophet heard the still, small voice, The way but seldom trod; The Prophet lifted up his eyes, And knew the voice of GOD! Men lay the rage of men to GOD; He hears the feeble call; GOD heeds; HIS is the kindest love, To be the friend of all! LOVE AND BEAUTY WHEN Beauty fills the lover's eyes, And lives like doubtful weather, Her bosom seems to sleep with love; They lie like birds together. Love finds them angels ready made, So beautiful and blooming; But Time comes in, though half afraid, And rudely calls them woman. Time, like a robber, every year Takes all the fame he gives; While Beauty only goes away, And Virtue only lives. THE COURTSHIP Where are you going lovely maid The morning fine &amp; early Im going to Walkerd Sir she said &amp; made accross the barley Her neck a thumb &amp; finger span Her bosom swelling over Her waist was half the vulgar kind An armful for a lover I asked her name she blushed away The question seemed to burn her A neighbour came &amp; passed the day &amp; called her Patty Turner She led me on a pleasant way Through fields when brown &amp; fallow Dear Walkerd lay upon the hill &amp; Stamford in the hollow I see the oak agen the door The wood agen the garden I bade good bye she turned agen With smiles my look rewarding I wrote my better poems there To beautys praise I owe it The muses they get all the praise But woman makes the poet A womans is the dearest love Theres nought on earth sincerer The leisure upon beautys breast Can any thing be dearer The muses they are living things &amp; beauty ever dear &amp; though I worshiped stocks &amp; stones Twas woman every where In loves delight my steps was led I sung of beautys choice I saw her in the books I read &amp; all was Mary Joyce I saw her love in beautys face I saw her in the rose I saw her in the fairest flowers In every weed that grows Till Patty fell in beautys way That dearer loves recall &amp; stood a flower in beautys way The lily of them all THE COWSLIPS THE dancing Cowslips come in pleasant hours; Though seldom sung, they're everybody's flowers: They hurry from the world, and leave the cold; And all the meadows turn from green to gold: The shepherd finds them where he went to play, And wears a nosegay in his mouth all day: The maiden finds them in the pleasant grove, And puts them in her bosom with her love; She loves the ladysmocks: and just beyond The water blobs close to the meadow-pond. I've often gone—about where blackthorns stood— And got the Bedlam-Cowslips in the wood; Then found the blackbird's nest, and noisy jay And up and threw the Cowslips all away! THE MOCK BIRD I'VE often tried, when tending sheep and cow, With bits of grass and peels of oaten straw, To whistle like the birds. The thrush would start To hear her song, and pause, and fly away; The blackbird never cared, but sang again; The nightingale's fine song I could not try; And when the thrush would mock her song, she paused, And sang another song no bird could do! She sang when all were done, and beat them all. I've often sat and mocked them half the day, Behind the hedge-row, thorn, or bullace tree: I thought how nobly I could act in crowds. The woods and fields were all the books I knew, And every leisure thought was Love and Fame. THE BOTANIST'S WALK THE Forest meets the blessings of the Spring; The chestnut throws her sticky buds away, And shows her pleasant leaves and snow-white flowers; The nightingale is loud, and often heard The notes of every song, and hardly known, She hides and sings, a stranger all the day; The spurge, with caper-flowers of yellow green— And called ‘wild capers’, when I went in woods To look for nests and hear the nightingale; Dog-mercury shoots; the sloe is full of flowers; A willow flowers, and just above the ground, The furze, like myrtle, scarce a finger long, Is every where, and full of golden flowers; And butterflies, the colour of the flowers— As if the winds had blown them from their stalks— Are all about, and every where is Spring!

thee The past I will not as a mourner bemoan For abscence leaves Mary still dearer to me How sweet are the glooms of the midsummer even Dark night in the bushes seems going to rest &amp; the bosom of Mary with fancys is heaving Where my sorrows &amp; feelings for seasons were blest Nor will I repine though in love we're divided She in the Lowlands &amp; I in the glen Of these forest beeches—by nature we're guided &amp; I shall find rest on her bosom agen How soft the dew falls on the leaves of the beeches How fresh the wild flower seems to slumber below How sweet are the lessons that nature still teaches For truth is her tidings wherever I go From school days of boyhood her image was cherished In manhood sweet Mary was fairer then flowers Nor yet has her name or her memory perished Though abscence like winter oer happiness lowers Though cares still will gather like clouds in my sky Though hopes may grow hopeless &amp; fetters recoil While the sun of existance sheds light in my eye I'll be free in a prison &amp; cling to the soil I'll cling to the spot where my first love was cherished Where my heart nay my soul unto Mary I gave &amp; when my last hope &amp; existance is perished Her memory will shine like a sun on my grave Mary thou ace of hearts thou muse of song The pole star of my being &amp; decay Earths coward foes my shattered bark may wrong Still thourt the sunrise of my natal day Born to misfortunes—where no sheltering bay Keeps off the tempest—wrecked where'er I flee I struggle with my fate—in trouble strong— Mary thy name loved long still keeps me free Till my lost life becomes a part of thee Song a I've wandered many a weary mile Love in my heart was burning To seek a home in Mary[s] smile But cold is loves returning The cold ground was a feather bed Truth never acts contrary I had no home above my head My home was love &amp; Mary I had no home in early youth When my first love was thwarted But if her heart still beats with truth We'll never more be parted &amp; changing as her love may be My own shall never vary Nor night nor day I'm never free But sigh for abscent Mary Nor night nor day nor sun nor shade Week month nor rolling year Repairs the breach wronged love hath made There madness—misery here Lifes lease was lengthened by her smiles —Are truth &amp; love contrary No ray of hope my life beguiles I've lost love home &amp; Mary Love is the main spring of existance—It Becomes a soul wherebye I live to love On all I see that dearest name is writ Falsehood is here—but truth has life above Where every star that shines exists in love Skys vary in their clouds—the seasons vary From heat to cold—change cannot constant prove The south is bright—but smiles can act contrary My guide star gilds the north—&amp; shines with Mary Song b Heres where Mary loved to be &amp; here are flowers she planted Here are books she loved to see &amp; here the kiss she granted Here on the wall with smileing brow Her picture used to cheer me Both walls &amp; rooms are naked now No Marys nigh to hear me The church spire still attracts my eye &amp; leaves me broken hearted Though grief hath worn their channels dry I sigh o'er days departed The churchyard where she used to play My feet could wander hourly My school walks there was every day Where she made winter flowery But where is angel Mary now Loves secrets none disclose 'em Her rosey cheeks &amp; broken vow Live in my aching bosom My life hath been one love—no blot it out My life hath been one chain of contradictions Madhouses Prisons wh?re shops—never doubt But that my life hath had some strong convictions That such was wrong—religion makes restrictions I would have followed—but life turned a bubble &amp; clumb the jiant stile of maledictions They took me from my wife &amp; to save trouble I wed again &amp; made the error double Yet abscence claims them both &amp; keeps them too &amp; locks me in a shop in spite of law Among a low lived set &amp; dirty crew Here let the Muse oblivions curtain draw &amp; let man think—for God hath often saw Things here too dirty for the light of day For in a madhouse there exists no law— Now stagnant grows my too refined clay I envy birds their wings to flye away How servile is the task to please alone Though beauty woo &amp; love inspire the song Mere painted beauty with her heart of stone Thinks the world worships while she flaunts along The flower of sunshine butterflye of song Give me the truth of heart in womans life The love to cherish one—&amp; do no wrong To none—O peace of every care &amp; strife Is true love in an estimable wife How beautifull this hill of fern swells on So beautifull the chappel peeps between The hornbeams—with its simple bell—alone I wander here hid in a palace green Mary is abscent—but the forest queen Nature is with me—morning noon &amp; gloaming I write my poems in these paths unseen &amp; when among these brakes &amp; beeches roaming I sigh for truth &amp; home &amp; love &amp; woman I sigh for one &amp; two—&amp; still I sigh For many are the whispers I have heard From beautys lips—loves soul in many an eye Hath pierced my heart with such intense regard I Looked for joy &amp; pain was the reward I think of them I love each girl &amp; boy Babes of two mothers—on this velvet sward &amp; nature thinks—in her so sweet employ While dews fall on each blossom weeping joy Here is the chappel yard enclosed with pales &amp; oak trees nearly top its little bell Here is the little bridge with guiding rail That leads me on to many a pleasant dell The fernowl chitters like a startled knell To nature—yet tis sweet at evening still— A pleasant road curves round the gentle swell Where nature seems to have her own sweet will Planting her beech &amp; thorn about the sweet fern hill I have had many loves—&amp; seek no more— These solitudes my last delights shall be The leaf hid forest—&amp; the lonely shore Seem to my mind like beings that are free Yet would I had some eye to smile on me Some heart where I could make a happy home in Sweet Susan that was wont my love to be &amp; Bessey of the glen—for I've been roaming With both at morn &amp; noon &amp; dusky gloaming Cares gather round I snap their chains in two &amp; smile in agony &amp; laugh in tears Like playing with a deadly serpent—who Stings to the death—there is no room for fears Where death would bring me happiness—his sheers Kills cares that hiss to poison many a vein The thought to be extinct my fate endears Pale death the grand phis[i]cian cures all pain The dead rest well—who lived for joys in vain Written in a Thunder storm July 15th 1841 The heavens are wrath—the thunders rattling peal Rolls like a vast volcano in the sky Yet nothing starts the apathy I feel Nor chills with fear eternal destiny My soul is apathy—a ruin vast Time cannot clear the ruined mass away My life is hell—the hopeless die is cast &amp; manhoods prime is premature decay Roll on ye wrath of thunders—peal on peal Till worlds are ruins &amp; myself alone Melt heart &amp; soul cased in obdurate steel Till I can feel that nature is my throne I live in love sun of undying light &amp; fathom my own heart for ways of good In its pure atmosphere day without night Smiles on the plains the forest &amp; the flood Smile on ye elements of earth &amp; sky Or frown in thunders as ye frown on me Bid earth &amp; its delusions pass away But leave the mind as its creator free This twilight seems a veil of gause &amp; mist Trees seem dark hills between the earth &amp; sky Winds sob awake &amp; then a gusty hist Fanns through the wheat like serpents gliding bye I love to stretch my length 'tween earth &amp; sky &amp; see the inky foliage oer me wave Though shades are still my prison where I lie Long use grows nature which I easy brave &amp; think how sweet cares rest within the grave Remind me not of other years or tell My broken hopes of joys they are to meet While thy own falshood rings the loudest knell To one fond heart that aches too cold to beat Mary how oft with fondness I repeat That name alone to give my troubles rest The very sound though bitter seemeth sweet— In my loves home &amp; thy own faithless breast Truths bonds are broke &amp; every nerve distrest Life is to me a dream that never wakes Night finds me on this lengthening road alone Love is to me a thought that ever aches A frost bound thought that freezes life to stone Mary in truth &amp; nature still my own That warms the winter of my aching breast Thy name is joy nor will I life bemoan— Midnight when sleep takes charge of natures rest Finds me awake &amp; friendless—not distrest Tie all my cares up in thy arms O sleep &amp; give my weary spirits peace &amp; rest I'm not an outlaw in this midnight deep If prayers are offered from sweet womans breast One &amp; one only made my being blest &amp; fancy shapes her form in every dell On that sweet bosom I've had hours of rest Though now through years of abscence doomed to dwell Day seems my night &amp; night seems blackest hell England my country though my setting sun Sinks in the ocean gloom &amp; dregs of life My muse can sing my Marys heart was won &amp; joy was heaven when I called her wife The only harbour in my days of strife Was Mary when the sea roiled mountains high When joy was lost &amp; every sorrow rife To her sweet bosom I was wont to flye To undecieve by truth lifes treacherous agony Friend of the friendless from a host of snares From lying varlets &amp; from friendly foes I sought thy quiet truth to ease my cares &amp; on the blight of reason found repose But when the strife of nature ceased her throes &amp; other hearts would beat for my return I trusted fate to ease my world of woes Seeking loves harbour—where I now sojourn —But hell is heaven could I cease to mourn For her for one whose very name is yet My hell or heaven—&amp; will ever be Falsehood is doubt—but I can ne'er forget Oaths virtuous falsehood volunteered to me To make my soul new bonds which God made free Gods gift is love &amp; do I wrong the giver To place affections wrong from Gods decree —No[w] when farewell upon my lips did quiver &amp; all seemed lost—I loved her more then ever I loved her in all climes beneath the sun Her name was like a jewel in my heart Twas heavens own choice—&amp; so Gods will be done Love ties that keep unbroken cannot part Nor can cold abscence sever or desert That simple beauty blessed with matchless charms Oceans have rolled between us—not to part E'en Icelands snows true loves delirium warms For there Ive dreamed—&amp; Mary filled my arms Song O Mary sing thy songs to me Of love &amp; beautys melody My sorrows sink beneath distress My deepest griefs are sorrowless So used to glooms &amp; cares am I My tearless troubles seem as joy O Mary sing thy songs to me Of love &amp; beautys melody ‘To be beloved is all I need &amp; them I love are loved indeed’ The soul of woman is my shrine &amp; Mary made my songs divine O for that time that happy time To hear thy sweet Piana's chime In music so divine &amp; clear That woke my soul in heaven to hear But heaven itself without thy face To me would be no resting place &amp; though the world was one delight No joy would live but in thy sight The soul of woman is my shrine Then Mary make those songs divine For music love &amp; melody Breath all of thee &amp; only thee Song Lovely Mary when we parted I ne'er felt so lonely hearted As I do now in field &amp; glen When hope says ‘we shall meet agen’ &amp; by yon spire that points to heaven Where my earliest vows was given By each meadow field &amp; fen I'll love thee till we meet agen True as the needle to the pole My life I love thee heart &amp; soul Wa'n't thy love in my heart enrolled Though love was fire 't'would soon be cold By thy eyes of heavens own blue My heart for thine was ever true By sun &amp; moon by sea &amp; shore My life I love thee more &amp; more &amp; by that hope that lingers last For heaven when lifes hell is past By time the present—past &amp; gone I've loved thee—&amp; I love thee on Thy beauty made youths life divine Till my soul grew a part of thine Mary I mourn no pleasures gone— The past hath made us both as one Now melancholly autumn comes anew With showery clouds &amp; fields of wheat tanned brown Along the meadow banks I peace pursue &amp; see the wild flowers gleaming up &amp; down Like sun &amp; light—the ragworts golden crown Mirrors like sunshine when sunbeams retire &amp; silver yarrow—there's the little town &amp; oer the meadows gleams that slender spire Reminding me of one—&amp; waking fond desire I love thee nature in my inmost heart Go where I will thy truth seems from above Go where I will thy landscape forms a part Of heaven—e'en these fens where wood nor grove Are seen—their very nakedness I love For one dwells nigh that secret hopes prefer Above the race of women—like the dove I mourn her abscence—fate that would deter My hate for all things—strengthens love for her Thus saith the great &amp; high &amp; lofty one Whose name is holy—home eternity In the high &amp; holy place I dwell alone &amp; with them also that I wish to see Of contrite humble spirits—from sin free Who trembles at my word—&amp; good recieve —Thou high &amp; lofty one—O give to me Truths low estate &amp; I will glad believe If such I am not—such I'm feign to live That form from boyhood loved &amp; still loved on That voice—that look—that face of one delight Loves register for years, months, weeks—time past &amp; gone Her looks was ne'er forgot or out of sight —Mary the muse of every song I write Thy cherished memory never leaves my own Though cares chill winter doth my manhood blight &amp; freeze like Niobe my thoughts to stone— Our lives are two—our end &amp; aim is one Ballad Sweet days while God your blessings send I call your joys my own —&amp; if I have an only friend I am not left alone She sees the fields the trees the spires Which I can daily see &amp; if true love her heart inspires Life still has joys for me She sees the wild flower in the dells That in my rambles shine The sky that oer her homstead dwells Looks sunny over mine The cloud that passes where she dwells In less then half an hour Darkens around these orchard dells Or melts a sudden shower The wind that leaves the sunny south &amp; fans the orchard tree Might steal the kisses from her mouth &amp; waft her voice to me O when will autumn bring the news Now harvest browns the fen That Mary as my vagrant muse &amp; I shall meet agen Tis pleasant now days hours begin to pass To dewy Eve—To walk down narrow close &amp; feel ones feet among refreshing grass &amp; hear the insects in their homes discourse &amp; startled blackbird flye from covert close Of white thorn hedge with wild fears fluttering wings &amp; see the spire &amp; hear the clock toll hoarse &amp; whisper names—&amp; think oer many things That love hurds up in truths imaginings Fame blazed upon me like a comets glare Fame waned &amp; left me like a fallen star Because I told the evil what they are &amp; truth &amp; falshood never wished to mar My Life hath been a wreck—&amp; I've gone far For peace &amp; truth—&amp; hope—for home &amp; rest —Like Edens gates—fate throws a constant bar— Thoughts may o'ertake the sunset in the west —Man meets no home within a womans breast Though they are blazoned in the poets song As all the comforts which our lifes contain I read &amp; sought such joys my whole life long &amp; found the best of poets sung in vain But still I read &amp; sighed &amp; sued again &amp; lost no purpose where I had the will I almost worshiped when my toils grew vain Finding no antidote my pains to kill I sigh a poet &amp; a lover still Song Dying gales of sweet even How can you sigh so Though the sweet day is leaving &amp; the sun sinketh low How can you sigh so For the wild flower is gay &amp; her dew gems all glow For the abscence of day Dying gales of sweet even Breath music from toil Dusky eve is loves heaven &amp; meets beautys smile Love leans on the stile Where the rustic brooks flow Dying gales all the while How can you sigh so Dying gales round a prison To fancy may sigh But day here hath risen Over prospects of joy Here Mary would toy When the sun it got low Even gales whisper joy &amp; never sigh so Labour lets man his brother Retire to his nest The babe meets its mother &amp; sleeps on her breast— The sun in the west Has gone down in the ocean Dying gales gently sweep O'er the hearts ruffled motion &amp; sing it to sleep Song The spring may forget that he reigns in the sky &amp; winter again hide her flowers in the snow The summer may thirst when her fountains are dry But I'll think of Mary wherever I go The bird may forget that her nest is begun When the snow settles white on the new budding tree &amp; nature in tempests forget the bright sun But I'll ne'er forget her—that was plighted to me How could I—how should I—that loved her so early Forget—when I've sung of her beauty in song How could I forget—what I've worshiped so dearly From boyhood to manhood—&amp; all my life long— As leaves to the branches in summer comes duly &amp; blossoms will bloom on the stalk &amp; the tree To her beauty I'll cling—&amp; I'll love her as truly &amp; think of sweet Mary wherever I be Song No single hour can stand for nought No moment hand can move But calenders a aching thought Of my first lonely love Where silence doth the loudest call My secrets to betray As moonlight holds the night in thrall As suns reveal the day I hide it in the silent shades Till silence finds a tongue I make its grave where time invades Till time becomes a song I bid my foolish heart be still But hopes will not be chid My heart will beat—&amp; burn—&amp; chill First love will not be hid When summer ceases to be green &amp; winter bare &amp; blea— Death may forget what I have been But I must cease to be When words refuse before the crowd My Marys name to give The muse in silence sings aloud &amp; there my love will live Now harvest smiles embrowning all the plain The sun of heaven oer its ripeness shines ‘Peace-plenty’ has been sung nor sung in vain As all bring forth the makers grand designs —Like gold that brightens in some hidden mines His nature is the wealth that brings increase To all the world—his sun forever shines —He hides his face &amp; troubles they increase He smiles—the sun looks out in wealth &amp; peace This life is made of lying &amp; grimace This world is filled with whoring &amp; decieving Hypocrisy ne'er masks an honest face Story's are told—but seeing is believing &amp; I've seen much from which there's no retrieving I've seen deception take the place of truth I've seen knaves flourish—&amp; the country grieving Lies was the current gospel in my youth &amp; now a man—I'm farther off from truth Song They near read the heart Who would read it in mine That love can desert The first truth on his shrine Though in Lethe I steep it &amp; sorrows prefer In my hearts core I keep it &amp; keep it for her For her &amp; her only Through months &amp; through years I've wandered thus lonely In sorrow &amp; fears My sorrows I smother Though troubles anoy In this world &amp; no other I cannot meet joy No peace nor yet pleasure Without her will stay Life looses its treasure When Mary's away Though the nightingale often In sorrow may sing —Can the blast of the winter Meet blooms of the spring Thou first best &amp; dearest Though dwelling apart To my heart still the nearest Forever thou art &amp; thou wilt be the dearest Though our joys may be o'er &amp; to me thou art nearest Though I meet thee no more Song Did I know where to meet thee Thou dearest in life How soon would I greet thee My true love &amp; wife How soon would I meet thee At close of the day Though cares would still cheat me If Mary would meet me I'd kiss her sweet beauty &amp; love them away &amp; when evening discovers The sun in the west I long like true lovers To lean on thy breast To meet thee my dearest —Thy eyes beaming blue Abscent pains the severest Feel Mary's the dearest And if Mary's abscent—how can I be true How dull the glooms cover This meadow &amp; fen Where I as a lover Seek Mary agen But silence is teazing Wherever I stray There's nothing seems pleasing Or aching thoughts easing Though Mary live's near me—she seems far away O would these gales murmur My love in her ear Or a birds note inform her While I linger here But nature contrary Turns night into day No bird—gale—or fairy Can whisper to Mary To tell her who seeks her—while Mary's away Dull must that being live who sees unmoved The scenes &amp; objects that his childhood knew The school yard &amp; the maid he early loved The sunny wall where long the old Elms grew The grass that e'en till noon retains the dew Beneath the wallnut shade I see them still Though not such fancys do I now pursue Yet still the picture turns my bosom chill &amp; leaves a void—nor love nor hope may fill After long abscence how the mind recalls Pleasing associations of the past Haunts of his youth—thorn hedges &amp; old walls &amp; hollow trees that sheltered from the blast &amp; all that map of boyhood overcast With glooms &amp; wrongs &amp; sorrows not his own That oer his brow like the scathed lightening past That turned his spring to winter &amp; alone Wrecked name &amp; fame &amp; all—to solitude unknown So on he lives in glooms &amp; living death A shade like night forgetting &amp; forgot Insects that kindle in the springs young breath Take hold of life &amp; share a brighter lot Then he the tennant of the hall &amp; Cot The princely palace too hath been his home &amp; Gipseys camp when friends would know him not In midst of wealth a beggar still to roam Parted from one whose heart was once his home &amp; yet not parted—still loves hope illumes &amp; like the rainbow brightest in the storm It looks for joy beyond the wreck of tombs &amp; in lifes winter keeps loves embers warm The oceans roughest tempest meets a calm Cares thickest cloud shall break in sunny joy O'er the parched waste showers yet shall fall like balm &amp; she the soul of life for whom I sigh Like flowers shall cheer me when the storm is bye Song O Mary dear three springs have been Three summers too have blossomed here Three blasting winters crept between Though abscence is the most severe Another summer blooms in green But Mary never once was seen I've sought her in the fields &amp; flowers I've sought her in the forest groves In avanues &amp; shaded bowers &amp; every scene that Mary loves E'en round her home I seek her here But Marys abscent every where Tis autumn &amp; the rustling corn Goes loaded on the creaking wain I seek her in the early morn But cannot meet her face again Sweet Mary she is abscent still &amp; much I fear she ever will The autumn morn looks mellow as the fruit &amp; ripe as harvest—every field &amp; farm Is full of health &amp; toil—yet never mute With rustic mirth &amp; peace the day is warm The village maid with gleans upon her arm Brown as the hazel nut from field to field Goes cheerily—the valleys native charm— I seek for charms that autumn best can yield In mellowing wood &amp; time ybleaching field Song Tis autumn now &amp; natures scenes The pleachy fields &amp; yellowing trees Looses their blooming hues &amp; greens But nature finds no change in me The fading woods the russet grange The hues of nature may desert But nought in me shall find a change To wrong the angel of my heart For Mary is my angel still Through every month &amp; every ill The leaves they loosen from the branch &amp; fall upon the gusty wind But my hearts silent love is staunch &amp; nought can tear her from my mind The flowers are gone from dell &amp; bower Though crowds from summers lap was given But love is an eternal flower Like purple amaranths in heaven To Mary first my heart did bow &amp; if she's true she keeps it now Just as the summer keeps the flower Which spring conscealed in hoods of gold Or unripe harvest met the shower &amp; made earths blessings manifold Just so my Mary lives for me A silent thought for months &amp; years The world may live in revellry Her name my lonely quiet cheers &amp; cheer it will what e'er may be While Mary lives to think of me Sweet comes the misty mornings in september Among the dewy paths how sweet to stray Greensward or stubbles as I well remember I once have done—the mist curls thick &amp; grey As cottage smoke—like net work on the sprey Or seeded grass the cobweb draperies run Beaded with pearls of dew at early day &amp; oer the pleachy stubbles peeps the sun The lamp of day when that of night is done What mellowness these harvest days unfold In the strong glances of the midday sun The homesteads very grass seems changed to gold The light in golden shadows seems to run &amp; tinges every spray it rests upon With that rich harvest hue of sunny joy Nature lifes sweet companion cheers alone— The hare starts up before the shepherd boy &amp; partridge coveys wir on russet wings of joy The meadow flags now rustle bleached &amp; dank &amp; misted oer with down as fine as dew The sloe &amp; dewberry shine along the bank Where weeds in blooms luxuriance lately grew Red rose the sun &amp; up the morehen flew From bank to bank the meadow arches stride Where foamy floods in winter tumbles through &amp; spread a restless ocean foaming wide Where now the cowboys sleep nor fear the coming tide About the medows now I love to sit On banks bridge walls &amp; rails as when a boy To see old trees bend oer the flaggy pit With hugh roots bare that time does not destroy Where sits the angler at his days employ &amp; there [the] Ivy leaves the bank to climb The tree—&amp; now how sweet to weary joy —Aye nothing seems so happy &amp; sublime As sabbath bells &amp; their delightfull chime Sweet solitude thou partner of my life Thou balm of hope &amp; every pressing care Thou soothing silence oer the noise of strife These meadow flats &amp; trees—the Autumn air Mellows my heart to harmony—I bear Lifes burthen happily—these fenny dells Seem Eden in this sabbath rest from care My heart with loves first early memory swells To hear the music of those village bells For in that hamlet lives my rising sun Whose beams hath cheered me all my lorn life long My heart to nature there was early won For she was natures self—&amp; still my song Is her through sun &amp; shade through right &amp; wrong On her my memory forever dwells The flower of Eden—evergreen of song Truth in my heart the same love story tells —I love the music of those village bells Song Heres a health unto thee bonny lassie O Leave the thorns o' care wi' me &amp; whatever I may be Here's happiness to thee Bonny lassie O Here's joy unto thee bonny lassie O Though we never meet again I well can bear the pain If happiness is thine Bonny lassie O Here is true love unto thee bonny lassie O Though abscence cold is ours The spring will come wi' flowers &amp; love will wait for thee Bonny lassie O So heres love unto thee bonny lassie O Aye wherever I may be Here's a double health to thee Till life shall cease to love Bonny lassie O The blackbird startles from the homestead hedge Raindrops &amp; leaves fall yellow as he springs Such images are natures sweetest pledge To me there's music in his rustling wings ‘Prink prink’ he cries &amp; loud the robin sings The small hawk like a shot drops from the sky Close to my feet for mice &amp; creeping things Then swift as thought again he suthers bye &amp; hides among the clouds from the pursueing eye Song Her cheeks are like roses Her eyes they are blue &amp; her beauty is mine If her heart it is true Her cheeks are like roses— &amp; though she's away I shall see her sweet beauty On some other day Ere the flowers of the spring Deck the meadow &amp; plain If theres truth in her bosom I shall see her again I will love her as long As the brooks they shall flow For Mary is mine &amp; Whereso ever I go Honesty &amp; good intentions are So mowed &amp; hampered in with evil lies She hath not room to stir a single foot Or even strength to break a spiders web —So lies keep climbing round loves sacred stem Blighting fair truth whose leaf is evergreen Whose roots are the hearts fibres &amp; whose sun The soul that cheers &amp; smiles it into bloom Till heaven proclaims that truth can never die The lightenings vivid flashes—rend the cloud That rides like castled crags along the sky &amp; splinters them to fragments—while aloud The thunders heavens artillery vollies bye Trees crash, earth trembles—beast prepare to flye Almighty what a crash—yet man is free &amp; walks unhurt while danger seems so nigh— Heavens archway now the rainbow seems to be That spans the eternal round of earth &amp; sky &amp; sea A shock, a moment, in the wrath of God Is long as hell's eternity to all His thunderbolts leave life but as the clod Cold &amp; inna[ni]mate—their temples fall Beneath his frown to ashes—the eternal pall Of wrath sleeps oer the ruins where they fell &amp; nought of memory may their creeds recall The sin of Sodom was a moments yell Fires death bed theirs their first grave the last hell The towering willow with its pliant boughs Sweeps its grey foliage to the autumn wind The level grounds where oft a group of cows Huddled together close—or propped behind An hedge or hovel ruminate &amp; find The peace—as walks &amp; health &amp; I pursue For natures every place is still resigned To happiness—new life's in every view &amp; here I comfort seek &amp; early joys renew The lake that held a mirror to the sun Now curves with wrinkles in the stillest place The autumn wind sounds hollow as a gun &amp; water stands in every swampy place Yet in these fens peace harmony &amp; grace The attributes of nature are alied The barge with naked mast in sheltered place Beside the brig close to the bank is tied While small waves plashes by its bulky side Song The floods come oer the meadow leas The dykes are full &amp; brimming Field furrows reach the horses knees Where wild ducks oft are swimming The skyes are black the fields are bare The trees their coats are loosing The leaves are dancing in the air The sun its warmth refusing Brown are the flags &amp; fadeing sedge &amp; tanned the meadow plains Bright yellow is the osier hedge Beside the brimming drains The crows sit on the willow tree The lake is full below But still the dullest thing I see Is self that wanders slow The dullest scenes are not so dull As thoughts I cannot tell The brimming dykes are not so full As my hearts silent swell I leave my troubles to the winds With none to share a part The only joy my feeling finds Hides in an aching heart Abscence in love is worse then any fate Summer is winters desert &amp; the spring Is like a ruined city desolate Joy dies &amp; hope retires on feeble wing Nature sinks heedless—birds unheeded sing Tis solitude in citys—crowds all move Like living death—though all to life still cling— The strongest bitterest thing that life can prove Is womans undisguise of hate &amp; love Song I think of thee at early day &amp; wonder where my love can be &amp; when the evening shadows grey O how I think of thee Along the meadow banks I rove &amp; down the flaggy fen &amp; hope my first &amp; early love To meet thee once agen I think of thee at dewy morn &amp; at the sunny noon &amp; walks with thee—now left forlorn Beneath the silent moon I think of thee I think of all How blest we both have been— The sun looks pale upon the wall &amp; autumn shuts the scene I can't expect to meet thee now The winter floods begin The wind sighs through the naked bough Sad as my heart within I think of thee the seasons through In spring when flowers I see In winters lorn &amp; naked view I think of only thee While life breaths on this earthly ball What e'er my lot may be Wether in freedom or in thrall Mary I think of thee Tis winter &amp; the fields are bare &amp; waste The air one mass of ‘vapour clouds &amp; storms’ The suns broad beams are buried &amp; oercast &amp; chilly glooms the midday light deforms Yet comfort now the social bosom warms Friendship of nature which I hourly prove Even in this winter scene of frost &amp; storms Bare fields the frozen lake &amp; leafless grove Are natures grand religion &amp; true love Song Thourt dearest to my bosom As thou wilt ever be While the meadows wear a blossom Or a leaf is on the tree I can forget thee never— While the meadow grass is green While the flood rolls down the river Thou art still my bonny queen While the winter swells the fountain While the spring awakes the bee While the chamois loves the mountain Thou'lt be ever dear to me Dear as summer to the sun As spring is to the bee Thy love was soon as won &amp; so twill ever be Thou'rt loves eternal summer The dearest maid I prove With bosom white as ivory &amp; warm as virgin love No falsehood gets between us Theres nought the tie can sever As cupid dwells with venus Thou'rt my own love forever Song In this cold world without a home Disconsolate I go The summer looks as cold to me As winters frost &amp; snow Though winters scenes are dull &amp; drear A colder lot I prove No home had I through all the year But Marys honest love But Love inconstant as the wind Soon shifts another way No other home my heart can find Life wasting day by day I sigh &amp; sit &amp; sit &amp; sigh For better days to come For Mary was my hope &amp; joy Her truth &amp; heart my home Her truth &amp; heart was once my home &amp; May was all the year But now through seasons as I roam Tis winter everywhere Hopeless I go through care &amp; toil No friend I e'er possest To reccompence for Marys smile &amp; the love within her breast My love was ne'er so blest as when It mingled with her own Told often to be told agen &amp; every feeling known But now loves hopes are all bereft A lonely man I roam &amp; abscent Mary long hath left My heart without a home 27 The Paigles Bloom In Shower's In Grassy Close How Sweet To Be Among Their Blossoms Led &amp; Hear Sweet Nature To Herself Discourse While Pale The Moon Is Bering Over Head &amp; Hear The Grazeing Cattle Softly Tread Cropping The Hedgerows Newly Leafing Thorn Sounds Soft As Visions Murmured Oer In Bed At Dusky Eve Or Sober Silent Morn For Such Delights Twere Happy Man Was Born 3 Green bushes &amp; green trees where fancy feeds On the retireing solitudes of May Where the sweet foliage like a volume reads &amp; weeds are gifts too choice to throw away How sweet the evening now succeeds the day The velvet hillock forms a happy seat The white thorn bushes bend with snowey may Dwarf furze in golden blooms &amp; violets sweet Make this wild scene a pleasure grounds retreat 18 Where are my ‘friends’ &amp; childern where are they The childern of two mothers born in joy One roof has held them—‘all’ have been at play Beneath the pleasures of a mothers eye —&amp; are my late hope's blighted—need I sigh Hath care commenced his long perpetual reign The spring &amp; summer hath with me gone bye Hope views the bud a flower &amp; not in vain Long is the night that brings no morn again 4 Now Come The Balm &amp; Breezes Of The Spring Not With The Pleasure's Of My Early Day's When Nature Seemed One Endless Song To Sing A Joyous Melody &amp; Happy Praise Ah Would They Come Agen—But Life Betrays Quicksands &amp;

The Laugh Of The Spring Shadowed Joys From On High While The Birds Sung About Us &amp; Cattle Grazed Round &amp; Beauty Was Blooming On Hamlets &amp; Farms How Sweet Steamed The Inscence Of Dew From The Ground While Patty Sweet Patty Sat Locked In My Arms 15 Yet Love Lives On In Every Kind of Weather In Heat &amp; Cold In Sunshine &amp; In Gloom Winter May Blight &amp; Stormy Clouds May Gather Nature Invigorates &amp; Love Will Bloom It Fears No Sorrow In A Life To Come But Lives Within Itself From Year To Year As Doth The Wild Flower In Its Own Perfume As In The Lapland Snows Springs Blooms Appear So True Love Blooms &amp; Blossoms Every Where Ballad The Rose Of The World Was Dear Mary To Me In The Days Of My Boyhood &amp; Youth I Told Her In Songs Where My Heart Wished To Be &amp; My Songs Where The Language of Truth I Told Her In Looks When I Gazed In Her Eyes That Mary Was Dearest To Me I Told Her In Words &amp; The Language Of Sighs Where My Whole Hearts Affections Would Be I Told her in love that all nature was true I convinced her that nature was kind But love in his trials had labour to do Mary would be in the mind Mary met me in spring where the speedwell knots grew &amp; the king cups were shining like flame I chose her all colours red yellow &amp; blue But my love was one hue &amp; the same Spring summer &amp; winter &amp; all the year through In the sunshine the shower &amp; the blast I told the same tale &amp; she knows it all true &amp; Mary's my blossom at last 16 Love is of heaven still the first akin Twas born In paradise &amp; left its home For desert lands stray hearts to nurse &amp; win Though pains like plagues pursue them where they roam Its joys are ever green &amp; blooms at home The sailor rocking on the giddy mast The soldier when the cannons cease to boom &amp; every heart its doubts or dangers past Beats on its way for love &amp; home at last 17 Nature thou truth of heaven if heaven be true Falsehood may tell her ever changeing lie But natures truth looks green in every view &amp; love in every Landscape glads the eye How beautifull these slopeing thickets lie Woods on the hills &amp; plains all smooth &amp; even Through which we see the ribboned evening skie Though Winter here in floods &amp; snows was driven Spring came like God &amp; turned it all to heaven 18 There Is A Tale For Every Day To Hear For Every Heart To Feel &amp; Tongue To Tell The Daughters Anzious Dread The Lovers Fear Pains That In Cots &amp; Palaces May Dwell Not Short &amp; Passing Like The Friends Farewell Where Tears May Fall &amp; Leave A Smile Beneath Eternal Grief Rings In The Passing Bell Tis Not The Sobs Of Momentary Breath Ties Part Forever In The Tale Of Death 19 The Dew falls on the weed &amp; on the flower The rose &amp; thistle bathe their heads in dew The lowliest heart may have its prospering hour The sadest bosom meet its wishes true E'en I may joy love happiness renew Though not the sweets of my first early days When one sweet face was all the loves I knew &amp; my soul trembled on her eyes to gaze Whose very censure seemed intended praise 20 A soul within the heart that loves the more Giving to pains &amp; fears eternal life Burning the flesh till it consumes the core So Love is still the eternal calm of strife Thou soul within a soul thou life of life Thou Essence of my hopes &amp; fears &amp; joys M?y my dear first love &amp; early wife &amp; still the flower my inmost soul enjoys Thy love's the bloom no canker worm destroys 21 Flow on my verse though barren thou mayest be Of thought—Yet sing &amp; let thy fancys roll In Early days thou sweept a mighty sea All calm in troublous deeps &amp; spurned controul Thou fire &amp; iceberg to an aching soul &amp; still an angel in my gloomy way Far better opiate then the draining bowl Still sing my muse to drive cares fiends away Nor heed what loitering listener hears the lay 22 My themes be artless cots &amp; happy plains Though far from man my wayward fancies flee Of fields &amp; woods rehearse in willing strains &amp; I mayhap may feed on joys with thee These cowslip fields this sward my pillow be So I may sleep the sun into the west My cot this awthorn hedge this spreading tree —Mary &amp; Martha once my daily guests &amp; still as mine both wedded loved &amp; blest 23 I rest my wearied life in these sweet fields Reflecting every smile in natures face &amp; much of joy this grass—These hedges yields Not found in citys where crowds daily trace Heart pleasures there hath no abideing place The star gemmed early morn the silent even Hath pleasures that our broken hopes deface To love too well leaves nought to be forgiven The Gates of Eden is the bounds of heaven 24 The apathy that fickle love wears through The doubts &amp; certaintys are still akin Its every joy has sorrow in the view Its holy truth like Eve's beguileing sin Seems to be losses even while we win Tormenting joys &amp; cheating into wrong &amp; still we love—&amp; fall into the Gin My sun of love was short—&amp; clouded long &amp; now its shadow fills a feeble song Song I saw her in my springs young choice Ere loves hopes looked upon the crowd Ere loves first secrets found a voice Or dared to speak the name aloud I saw her in my boyish hours A Girl as fair as heaven above When all the world seemed strewn with flowers &amp; every pulse &amp; look was love I saw her when her heart was young I saw her when my heart was true When truth was all the themes I sung &amp; Love the only muse I knew Ere infancy had left her brow I seemed to love her from her birth &amp; thought her then as I do now The dearest angel upon earth 25 O she was more then fair—divinely fair Can language paint the soul in those blue eyes Can fancy read the feelings painted there —Those hills of snow that on her bosom lies Or beauty speak for all those sweet replies That through loves visions like the sun is breaking Wakeing new hopes &amp; fears &amp; stifled sighs From first love's dreame's my love is scarcely waking The wounds might heal but still the heart is aching 26 Her looks was like the spring her very voice Was springs own music more then song to me Choice of my boyhood nay my souls first choice From her sweet thralldom I am never free Yet here my prison is a spring to me Past memories bloom like flowers where e'er I rove My very bondage though in snares—is free I love to stretch me in this shadey Grove &amp; muse upon the memories of love Hail Solitude still Peace &amp; Lonely good Thou spirit of all joys to be alone My best of friends these glades &amp; this green wood Where nature is herself &amp; loves her own The hearts hid anguish here I make it known &amp; tell my troubles to the gentle wind Friends cold neglects have froze my heart to stone &amp; wrecked the voyage of a quiet mind With wives &amp; friends &amp; every hope disjoined Wrecked of all hopes save one to be alone Where Solitude becomes my wedded mate Sweet Forest with rich beauties overgrown Where solitude is queen &amp; riegns in state Hid in green trees I hear the clapping gate &amp; voices calling to the rambling cows I Laugh at Love &amp; all its idle fate The present hour is all my lot alows An age of sorrow springs from lovers vows Sweet is the song of Birds for that restores The soul to harmony the mind to love Tis natures song of freedom out of doors Forests beneath free winds &amp; clouds above The Thrush &amp; Nightingale &amp; timid dove Breathe music round me where the gipseys dwell— Pierced hearts left burning in the doubts of love Are desolate where crowds &amp; citys dwell— The splendid palace seems the gates of hell DON JUAN A POEM ‘Poets are born’—&amp;

half or beer —I wish prince Albert &amp; the noble dastards Who wed the wives—would get the noble bastards I wish prince Albert on his german journey I wish the Whigs were out of office &amp; Pickled in law books of some good atorney For ways &amp; speeches few can understand They'll bless ye when in power—in prison scorn ye &amp; make a man rent his own house &amp; land— I wish prince Alberts queen was undefiled —&amp; every man could get his wife with child I wish the devil luck with all my heart As I would any other honest body His bad name passes bye me like a f?t Stinking of brimstone—then like whisky toddy We swallow sin which seems to warm the heart —There's no imputing any sin to God—he Fills hell with work—&amp; is'n't it a hard case To leave old whigs &amp; give to hell the carcass Me?b?ne may throw his wig to little Vicky &amp; so resign his humbug &amp; his power &amp; she with the young princess mount the dickey On ass milk diet for her german tour Asses like ministers are rather tricky I &amp; the country proves it every hour W?ll?gt?n &amp; M?lb?n in their station Coblers to queens—are phisic to the nation These batch of toadstools on this rotten tree Shall be the cabinet of any queen Though not such coblers as her servants be They're of Gods making—that is plainly seen Nor red nor green nor orange—they are free To thrive &amp; flourish as the Whigs have been But come tomorrow—like the Whigs forgotten You'll find them withered stinking dead and rotten Death is an awfull thing it is by God I've said so often &amp; I think so now Tis rather droll to see an old wig nod Then doze &amp; die the devil don't know how Odd things are wearisome &amp; this is odd— Tis better work then kicking up a row I'm weary of old Whigs &amp; old whigs heirs &amp; long been sick of teazing God with prayers I've never seen the cow turn to a bull I've never seen the horse become an ass I've never seen an old brawn cloathed in whool— But I have seen full many a bonny lass &amp; wish I had one now beneath the cool Of these high elms—Muse tell me where I was O—talk of turning I've seen Whig &amp; Tory Turn imps of hell—&amp; all for Englands glory I love good fellowship &amp; wit &amp; punning I love ‘true love’ &amp; God my taste defend I hate most damnably all sorts of cunning— I love the Moor &amp; Marsh &amp; Ponders end— I do not like the song of ‘cease your funning’ I love a modest wife &amp; trusty friend —Bricklayers want lime as I want ryhme for fillups —So here's a health to sweet Eliza Phillips Song Eliza now the summer tells Of spots where love &amp; beauty dwells Come &amp; spend a day with me Underneath the forest tree Where the restless water flushes Over mosses mounds &amp; rushes &amp; where love &amp; freedom dwells With orchis flowers &amp; fox glove bells Come dear Eliza set me free &amp; oer the forest roam with me Here I see the morning sun Among the beachtree's shadows run That into gold the short sward turns Where each bright yellow blossom burns With hues that would his beams out shine Yet nought can match those smiles of thine I try to find them all the day But none are nigh when thou'rt away Though flowers bloom now on every hill Eliza is the fairest still The sun wakes up the pleasant morn &amp; finds me lonely &amp; forlorn Then wears away to sunny noon The flowers in bloom the birds in tune While dull &amp; dowie all the year No smiles to see no voice to hear I in this forest prison lie With none to heed my silent sigh &amp; underneath this beachen tree With none to sigh for Love but thee Now this new poem is entirely new As wedding gowns or money from the mint For all I know it is entirely true For I would scorn to put a lie in print —I scorn to lie for princes—so would you &amp; ere I shoot I try my pistol flint —The cattle salesman—knows the way in trying &amp; feels his bullocks ere he thinks of buying Lord bless me now the day is in the gloaming &amp; every evil thought is out of sight How I should like to purchase some sweet woman Or else creep in with my two wives to night— Surely that wedding day is on the comeing Abscence like phisic poisons all delight— Mary &amp; Martha both an evil omen Though both my own—they still belong to no man But to our text again—&amp; pray where is it Begin as parsons do at the beginning Take the first line friend &amp; you cannot miss it ‘Poets are born’ &amp; so are whores for sinning —Here's the court circular—o Lord is this it Court cards like lists of—not the naked meaning Here's Albert going to germany they tell us &amp; the young queen down in the dumps &amp; jealous Now have you seen a tramper on race courses Seeking an honest penny as his trade is Crying a list of all the running horses &amp; showing handbills of the sporting ladies —In bills of fare you'll find a many courses Yet all are innoscent as any maid is Put these two dishes into one &amp; dress it &amp; if there is a meaning—you may guess it Don Juan was Ambassador from russia But had no hand in any sort of tax His orders hung like blossoms of the fushia &amp; made the ladies hearts to melt like wax He knew Napoleon &amp; the king of prusia &amp; blowed a cloud oer spirits wine or max But all his profits turned out losses rather To save one orphan which he forced to father Theres Docter Bottle imp who deals in urine A keeper of state prisons for the queen As great a man as is the Doge of Turin &amp; save in London is but seldom seen Yclep'd old A?ll?n—mad brained ladies curing Some p?x?d like Flora &amp; but seldom clean The new road oer the forest is the right one To see red hell &amp; further on the white one Earth hells or b?gg?r sh?ps or what you please Where men close prisoners are &amp; women ravished I've often seen such dirty sights as these I've often seen good money spent &amp; lavished To keep bad houses up for docters fees &amp; I have known a b?gg?rs tally travers'd Till all his good intents began to falter —When death brought in his bill &amp; left the halter O glorious constitution what a picking Ye've had from your tax harvest &amp; your tythe Old hens which cluck about that fair young chicken —Cocks without spurs that yet can crow so blythe Truth is shut up in prison while ye're licking The gold from off the gingerbread—be lythe In winding that patched broken old state clock up Playhouses open—but mad houses lock up Give toil more pay where rank starvation lurches &amp; pay your debts &amp; put your books to rights Leave whores &amp; playhouses &amp; fill your churches Old clovenfoot your dirty victory fights Like theft he still on natures manor poaches &amp; holds his feasting on anothers rights To show plain truth you act in bawdy farces Men show their tools—&amp; maids expose their arses Now this day is the eleventh of July &amp; being sunday I will seek no flaw In man or woman—but prepare to die In two days more I may that ticket draw &amp; so may thousands more as well as I To day is here—the next who ever saw &amp;

laid the corner stone When all the morning stars together sang &amp; all the sons of God did shout for joy Or who as if with doors shut up the sea When it break forth as issuing from the womb When I made its garments of the racking clouds &amp; wrapt thick darkness as its swaddling bands &amp; brake up for it my decreed abode &amp; set up bars &amp; doors to keep it staid &amp; said here shalt thou come not further &amp; here shalt thy proud waves be staid Hast thou commanded morning since thy days &amp; caused the bright day spring to know its place That it might hold on earths extreemest ends &amp; the wicked might be shaken out therefrom It is turned as clay into the seal &amp; they stand as garments cloathing it with light Their light from wickedness is still withheld &amp; the high arm is broken in its might Hast thou entered in the ocean springs Or walked in search of the unfathomed deeps Hath death his gates e'er opened unto thee Or shown the shadows of eternal sleep Hast thou percieved the breadth of earth or space If thou knowest all or part thereof—declare Where is the way wherein the light may dwell &amp; as for darkness where doth it repose That thou should'st take it to the bound thereof &amp; know the paths that leadeth to its home Knowest thou as much because thou wast then born Or since because thy numbered days was great Hast thou entered the palace of the snow Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail Which for the time of trouble I reserve Against the day of battle &amp;

gives the thunder terrors shuddering voice To cause the rain on spots where no man is On wildered wastes where no man cares to dwell To satisfy the waste &amp; desolate ground &amp; cause the bud to blossom there in spring Hath the rain a father—silence—speak Or who begets the drops of morning dew Out of whose womb cometh the chilly ice &amp; the heavens hoar frost who gendered can[s]t thou tell The waters are hidden as beneath a stone &amp; the face of the deep is frozen like a rock The influences of Pleiades canst thou bind Or loosen Orions belt—canst thou bring forth Nazzaroth in his season or yet guide Arcturus with his sons—man knowest thou The ordinances of heaven—canst thou set The dominion thereof in earth—let silence speak Canst thou lift up thy voice to clouds &amp; sky &amp; bid the rain in waters cover thee Canst thou send lightenings forth that they may go &amp; answer ‘here we are’—say who hath put Wisdom in the inward parts &amp; who hath given Prime understanding to the beating heart Who can number in wisdom heavens host of clouds Or the bottles of heaven who can stay When the clods cleave fast together &amp; the dust Groweth hard as a rock—can mortals hunt Prey for the Lion or the lions whelps When hid in dens or in the coverts couched They lie in wait for prey—&amp; who provides The raven with his food—his young ones cry To God &amp;

strange As though they were not hers—her labour is In vain withouten fear—God hath deprived Her heart of reason—understanding lacks To aid her toils—yet when she soars on high She scorns both horse &amp; rider in her flight Hast thou given the horse his strength or cloathed His neck with thunder—canst thou make him fear &amp; flee like a grasshopper—the glory Of his nostrils is fierce &amp; terrible He paweth the ground in strength rejoiceing &amp; goeth onward to meet the battle He scorns to be affraid &amp; mocks at fear Neither turneth he away from the sword Against him the loaded quiver rattles The glittering spear &amp; the burnished shield &amp; his untamed fierceness swallows the ground Neither heeds he the sound of the trumpet He drives among the trumpets &amp; laugheth ah ah &amp; the rage of battle he smelleth afar The thunder of captains &amp; shoutings of war Doth thy weak wisdom teach the hawk to flye &amp; stretch her wings toward the southern sky At thy command doth eagles mount &amp; make Their nests on high—their erie is the rock In the strong place &amp; on the rocky crag From thence their prey is noted &amp; their eyes Beholdeth far—her young ones suck up blood &amp; where the slain is—there the eagles flye JOB CHAP 40 Moreover God answered Job &amp; said Shall he who contends with God instruct him He that reproveth God—let man reprove Then Job made answer Lord behold I'm vile What shall I answer thee—my voice is dumb I lay my hand upon my mouth &amp;

join &amp; sundering is in vain He neeses &amp; a splendid light doth shine His eyes are like the mornings bright &amp; fair Out of his mouth breath comes like burning lamps &amp; issuing sparks leap out as living fire His nostrils as a boiling chaldron smokes His breath is kindled coals—&amp; terrors flames Come issuing from his mouth in terrors play In's neck like to a mountain strength remains &amp; sorrow before him is turned to joy His flakes of flesh join firm within themselves &amp; fast as is the mountain cant be moved His heart is like the stone of adamant Nay as the nether mill stone firm &amp; hard When he is roiled the mighty are affraid When he breaks forth they purifye themselves The sword assailing him will never hold The dark harbergeon or glittering spear Iron is straw &amp; brass as rotten wood The arrow neither makes him fear or flee Sling stones are stubble aiming at his power Darts count as rotten straw &amp; are no more He laugheth at the shaking of a spear Sharp stones are under him he heeds them not He spreads sharp pointed things upon the mire The sea beneath him like a chaldron boils &amp;

forever Thou saidst it—so depart Thou remembered not the giver Nor laid these things to heart No wickedness on earth can thee defend Thou ne'er remembered once the latter end Therefore hear thou this Thou Lady to pleasures given That dwelleth careless &amp; amiss &amp; rests no hope on heaven Saying ‘I am’ as there was none beside ‘&amp; know no loss of childern in my pride’ ‘Nor be a widow lone’ Yet these too mournfull things Shall in a moment reach thy throne With all that sorrow brings For all thy devinations shall they come &amp;

led me to darkness &amp; not into light He turneth his hand against me all the day My flesh &amp; my skin he made old as a prey He hath builded against me &amp; broken my bones I'm compassed with gall &amp; travel &amp; moans He hath set me in places of darkness &amp; cold Like a being forgot as the dead are of old He hath made my chain heavy &amp; hedged me about He hath shut out my prayer &amp; I cannot get out He hath enclosed all my ways with hewn heavy stone &amp; made all my paths both crooked &amp; lone He was unto me as a bear by the way Or hideing in secret as a lion to slay He pulled me in pieces my ways were all turned Like a desolate being I sorrowed &amp; mourned I'm a mark for his arrow he bendeth his bow &amp; empties his quiver to pince me with woe To my people I was a derision &amp; prey &amp; their song was my sufferings all the long day He hath filled me with bitterness trouble &amp; thrall &amp; made me mad drunk both with wormwood &amp; gall With gravel stones also my teeth he hath broke He hath covered me over with ashes &amp; smoke Thou took my souls peace in a desolate hour I forgot my prosperity riches &amp; power &amp; I said that my strength in the Lord now must sever &amp; my hopes in my God now are perished forever Remembering mine afflictions my misery &amp; thrall Confinement persecution—the wormwood &amp; gall My soul hath them still in remembrance the pain &amp; is humbled within me to feel it again This I recall to my mind &amp; I sigh Yet therefore have hope that the worst may be bye It is of Gods mercies we are not consumed Because his compassions fail not—yet entombed His love seems to me in the desolate hours Yet faith shall be new every morning like flowers The Lord saith my soul is my portion &amp; stay Therefore he's my hope both by night &amp; by day The Lord he is good unto them that will wait To the soul that will seek him both early &amp; late It is good that a man he should hope without friends For the Lord of salvation to make him amends It is good that a man bear the yoke of his youth &amp; endure persecution for the sake of the truth He keepeth his silence &amp; sitteth alone Because he hath born it as a grief of his own He hideth &amp; putteth his mouth in the dust If so that the Lord be his hope &amp; his trust He giveth his cheek to the smiter nor fears He is filled with reproach at their insolent jeers For his Lord &amp; his God forsake him will never &amp; though he cause grief will not leave him for ever He will have compassion—I am not affraid For his mercies in multitudes come to our aid He hurteth not willingly th'afflicted agen Nor willingly grieveth the childern of men To c[r]ush underfoot the imprisoned of earth To turn aside the right of a man from his birth To subvert a man in his cause or to blot But his right the most high he approveth it not Who saith &amp; it cometh to pass in the sun When the Lord he commandeth it not to be done Out of Gods mouth it was ne'er understood That mixture proceeded of evil &amp; good Wherefore doth a living man daily complain When our sins they are punished rebukeing is vain Let us search out our ways &amp; to comfort accord &amp; turn us agen to the help of the Lord Let us lift up our hearts &amp; our hands unforgiven Imploreing God the most high &amp; the mercies of heaven We have transgressed &amp; rebelled against thee Thou hast covered with anger—persecuted we flee Thou hast not pardoned we seek thee again Thou hast not pittied but smitten &amp; slain Thou hast covered thyself in the depth of a cloud That our prayer should not pass or be heard uttered loud In the midst of thy people—the great &amp; the small Thou hast made us the refuse offscouring of all All enemies open their mouths to deride Fear &amp; snares are against us on every side Desolation destruction hath left us no shore With rivers of waters mine eyes runneth oer For the destruction of the daughter of my people's renown Without intermission my tears trickle down Till the lord shall look down from the heavens &amp; see I mourn for my own citys daughters &amp; me Mine enemies chased me like a bird from its nest My heart from its home &amp; would give me no rest They've cut off my life in the dungeon—to sever &amp; cast a stone on the door of my freedom forever I said I'm cut off &amp; my heart it felt dead When waters &amp; darkness flowed over mine head From out the low dungeon I called on thy name Thou heardest O Lord my petition &amp; came Hide not thine ear to my breathing &amp; cry Thou drawest near in the day that I thought I should die ‘Fear not’ was the voice when I called upon thee Thou hast pleaded the cause of my soul &amp; I'm free Thou hast witnessed my wrongs &amp; redeemed my life Judge thou my cause thou hast witnessed the strife Against me all their vengance thy wisdom hath seen &amp; thou knowest what their hidden immag[in]ings mean The lips of all those who rose up in the fray Their device against me is as clear as the day Their reproaches thou hearest—when they sit down or rise I am their music to scoff &amp; despise Render them Lord as their justice demands A reccompence mete to the work of their hands Give them sorrow of heart that may inly condemn Be the hatred of heaven thy curse upon them Persecute &amp; destroy them as somthing abhored From under the face of thy heaven O Lord PRAYER OF HABACUK I heard thee O Lord &amp; was stricken with fear When the voice of thy wrath rung a knell to my ear Revive thou thy work in the midst of my days That my heart may rejoice in thy bounty &amp; praise O Lord ere thy vengance in fury come forth Remember thy mercy in midst of thy wrath Thou, Lord God of Temaan, thou most holy one From the mountains of Paran thy presence was shown Thy glory encircled the face of the sky &amp; the earth it was full of thy praise from on high Thy brightness was glory the essence of light &amp; thy hands held the horns of thy power in my sight Before thee pale famine &amp; pestilence came &amp; coals at thy feet burnt &amp; kindled to flame He measured the earth in loud pealings of thunder He beheld &amp; the nations were driven asunder The hills everlasting were shook in his scales The perpetual mountains bowed down into vales His power is eternal everlasting his ways &amp; earth air &amp; heaven are full of his praise The tents of all Cush in affliction I saw &amp; The Curtains of Midian did tremble in awe Was thy wrath against rivers O Lord that they flee Did thine anger swell mountains in calms of the sea When thou rode on thy horses &amp; chariots of fire O Lord was the chosen's salvation thine Ire Thy Bow was quite naked—Lord sheath up thy sword According to the oaths of the tribes &amp; thy word Thou didst cleave earth with rivers that mightily sped Mountains saw thee &amp; trembled, yea, trembled &amp; fled Worlds of water broke loose &amp; in thunder passed bye The deep uttered voices &amp; mounted on high His brine in the clouds of the heaven was mixed Sun &amp; Moon in their grand habitation were fixed These all wait on thee though high mountains in size &amp; their meat in due season thy bounty supplies That thou givest they feed on as succour &amp; food Thou op'nest thy hand lo! it fills them with good Thou hidest thy face they are troubled &amp; cry Thou takest their breath &amp; in dust they all lie Thou sendest thy spirit they start into birth &amp; again thou renewest the face of the earth The glory of God is endureing for ever The Lord shall rejoice in his works as the giver Though thou lookest on earth &amp; it quakes at thy stroke Though he toucheth the hills in their pride &amp; they smoke I will sing while I live my creator to praise I will sing praise to God to the end of my days Meditation of him shall sweet comfort afford &amp; my heart shall be glad in the Love of the Lord Let sinners consume from the face of the earth Let the wicked no more have a being or birth Bless thou the Lord o my heart &amp; my soul Praise ye the Lord long as seasons shall roll THE LAST JUDGMENT —ST MATT.

he is my son But the vain unbelieving &amp; them that have fear The abominable—murderers whoremongers &amp; liars Idolaters scorcerers mocking the seer I leave in the lake of unquenchable fires There burning forever their being &amp; breath &amp; this is the second existance of death One of the seven angels then came unto me Which held the seven plagues in seven phials of strife Saying come hither &amp; I will show unto thee The light of salvation the bride &amp; lambs wife &amp; me in the spirit he carried away &amp; won To a great &amp; high mountain that peered to the sun Whose forhead looked green in the realms of the sky Whose crags in the beams of eternity nod &amp; shewed me a city great glorious &amp; high New Jerusalem descending from heaven &amp; God Having Gods glory eternitys light As precious as jasper as crystal more bright &amp; had a great wall shining spacious &amp; high &amp; twelve gates about it that glittered like flames &amp; twelve angels watched from the realms of the sky &amp; written thereon were the tribes &amp; their names On the east &amp; the north six gates I descried &amp; the south &amp; the west three on every side Twelve foundations the walls of the city upheld &amp; twelve names thereon—the apostles of God &amp; he that talked with me a golden reed held An emblem of justice &amp; truth not his rod To measure the city the gates &amp; the wall In kindness &amp; love doing equal by all &amp; the plan of the city it lieth foursquare The breadth is as long as the height &amp; the length Twelve thousand furlongs his reed measured there The contents of that city of glory &amp; strength The length &amp; the breadth &amp; the height of the plan Are equal—like God in his mercey to man &amp; he measured the wall with the reed in his hand Of cubits one hundred &amp; forty &amp; four According to the measure of a man was the wand That is of the angel who guarded the door The walls was of jasper the city pure gold As clear as a mirror of glass to behold The walls of the city were garnished like fire With all manner of sorts of rich precious stones The first foundation was jasper the second sapphire The third chalcedony more splendid then thrones The fourth was an emerald green as the waves Of the earth that was vanished with oceans &amp; graves The fifth was sardonix &amp; sardius the sixth The seventh was chrysolyte—yellow &amp; green &amp; Beryl the eight[h] &amp; of yellow unmixt The ninth was a topaz—the rest they were seen Chrysoparsus a jacinth an amethist—blue As violets that in the old fallen world grew The twelve gates were twelve pearls of delight to behold Every gate was one pearl where no mortal could look &amp; the street of the city was paved with pure gold Transparent as glass &amp; the waves of a brook &amp; no temple there showed itself in my sight For the Lord God himself was its temple &amp; light No need had the city of sun or the moon To shine on its splendour—the builder &amp; giver Of its glory—was also its light &amp; its boon His sun shone upon it for ever &amp; ever There the nations of them that are saved meet a home There the kings of the earth bring their glories &amp; come &amp; its gates they shall never be closed by day &amp; night in that city shall never be known The righteous shall there truth &amp; glory display &amp; the honour of nations shall make it their own No wickedness there shall destroy their abode Or enemies poison the friendship of God In no wise shall enter any thing to defile &amp; no abomination of evil come nigh No wickedness working deception or guile Nor any that forgeth or maketh a lie But they which are written in Gods book of life They shall live here forever from sorrow &amp; strife THE RIVER OF THE WATER OF LIFE —REV. CHAP. 22 &amp; he showed me a river in midst of the street Of the water of life clear as chrystal &amp; pure Flowing out from the throne of the Lord—heaven sweet The weary to bless &amp; the feeble to care &amp; on each side the river like comfort in thrall The tree of life grew as a blessing for all Twelve manner of fruits did its branches supply That every month ripened—so fertile the sod &amp; the leaves of the tree 'neath Jehovahs own eye Held a cure for the nations who trusted in God No curse shall there be in that endless of day With the Lord—where his servants shall serve him for aye &amp; his name it shall be on their forheads of light &amp; they shall see his face—nor his majesty shun No candle is needed where never was night Neither is wanted the light of the sun For the Lord God of light &amp; of life is the giver &amp; they shall reign with him forever &amp; ever &amp; he said unto me all these sayings are true &amp; faithfull—&amp; now are as being begun The God of the prophets sent his angel to shew To his servants the things which must shortly be done Behold I come quickly &amp; blessed is he Who keepeth the sayings of this prophecy I John saw these things &amp; heard while I saw &amp; when I had heard &amp; had seen unforgot I fell at the feet of the angel with awe But he said unto me see thou do it not For I'm thy fellow servant &amp; worship aright &amp; of thy bretheren the prophets who live in his light Of them which keep the sayings this book doth contain Of which thou art witness what God doth reveal Worship God—him alone—other worship is vain These sayings he said unto me—never seal Leave the prophecy open till all understand For the kingdom is come &amp; the time is at hand &amp; he thats unjust—unjust let him be &amp; he that is filthy live filthy at will &amp; he that is righteous—leave righteousness free &amp; he that is holy live holily still Behold I come quickly my reward is with me To give all men according as his work it shall be I am Alpha Omega beginning &amp; end Time past as the present—the first &amp; the last They are blest that on all my commandments attend The tree of life is their right—when lifes troubles is past The gates are all open the passage is free &amp; the new golden city their dwelling shall be For without the dogs growl &amp; the sorcerers cheat &amp; murder that stabs with idolators bye &amp; whoremongers all their old deeds to repeat &amp; they whoso loveth &amp; maketh a lie I Jesus have sent my angel t'record These things unto you &amp; the church of the Lord I am the offspring of David &amp; root &amp; I am the bright &amp; the morning star &amp; the bride &amp; the spirit say come—eat the fruit &amp; let him that heareth say come from afar &amp; let him that parcheth with thirst come &amp; drink For the water of life ever flows to the brink To every man living I now testify That hears the words of this book—&amp; yet doeth the sin To add any thing unto this prophecy God shall send him the plagues that are written therein &amp; if any man take from this book—dealing strife God shall take out his part from the volume of life &amp; in the most holy city shall meet with no home Nor share of the things in this volume of joy He that testifieth this saitheth quickly I come Even so come Lord Jesus all sin to destroy The power of Gods love be with all—now—&amp;

May 1844. GRAVES OF INFANTS 1 Infants graves are steps of angels, where Earth's brightest gems of innocence repose; God is their parent, they need no tear, He takes them to his bosom from earth's woes; A bud their life-time, and a flower their close. Their spirits are an iris of the skies, Needing no prayers—a sunset's happy close. Gone are the bright rays of their soft blue eyes; Dews on flowers mourn them, and the gale that sighs. 2 Their lives were nothing but a sunny shower, Melting on flowers as tears melt from the eye: Their death were dew-drops on heavens amaranthine bower; 'Twas told on flowers as summer gales went by. They bowed, and trembled, yet they left no sigh, And the sun smiled to show their end was well. Infants have nought to weep for ere they die. All prayers are needless—beads they need not tell; White flowers their mourners are, nature their passing bell. June 1844. TO MISS C? 1 Thy glance is the brightest; Thy voice is the sweetest; Thy step is the lightest; Thy shape the compleatest; Thy waist, I could span dear; Thy neck's like a swan's dear; And roses the sweetest, On thy cheek's do appear. 2 The music of spring, Is the voice of my charmer; When the nightingales sing, She's as sweet;—who would harm her; Where the snowdrop, and lily lies, They shew her face:—but her eyes, Are the dark clouds,—(yet warmer)— From which the quick lightning flies,— O'er the face of my charmer. 3 Her face is the snowdrop, So pure on its stem, And love in her bosom, She wears as a gem. She is young as spring flowers, And sweet as may showers, Swelling the clover buds, bending the stem, She's the sweetest of blossoms; she's loves favorite gem. SONG [By all those token flowers that spring] By all those token flowers that spring; To lovers welcome thoughts still bring, Forget-me-not's of heavenly blue: I love the leal and true. By the speedwell's silver eye, Looking hopes upon the sky, By all these token blooms that tell, My fondness sends speedwell. By the hare-bell's hazure sky, (Like the hue of thy bright eye;) That grows in woods, and groves so fair, Where love I'd meet thee there. By the violets sweet perfume; By the primrose in its bloom; For thy bosom, and thy hair, I love thee maiden fair. By the daisy on the green; By the crow flowers golden shene; Flowers I gathered when a boy, Thou art loves earliest toy. By all the blooms of spring that tell, In silent language love so well; Those flowers of yellow, white, and blue; I love the leal and true. TO LIBERTY 1 O spirit of the wind and sky; Where doth thy harp neglected lie? Is there no heart thy bard to be, To wake that soul of melody; Is liberty herself a slave? No God forbids it, On ye brave; 2 I've loved thee, as the common air, And paid thee worship every where; In every soil beneath the sun, Thy simple song, my heart has won; And art thou silent! still a slave? And thy son's living; On ye brave. 3 Gather on mountain, and on plain, Make gossamer the iron chain, Make prison walls as paper screen, That tyrant maskers may be seen; Let earth, as well as heaven be free, So, on ye brave for liberty. 4 I've loved thy being from a boy, The highland hills was once my joy; Then morning mists did round them lie, Like sunshine in the happiest sky. Her hills, and valleys, seemed my own, When Scottish land was freedom's throne. 5 And Scottish land is freedom's still; Her beacon fires on every hill, Have told in characters of flame, Her ancient birthright, and her fame; A thousand hills will speak again, In fire, that language ever plain. 6 To sychop[h]ants, and fawning knaves, That Scotland, ne'er was made for slaves.— Her fruitful vales, her mountain thrones, Are ruled by natures laws alone: And nought but falshoods poisoned breath, Will urge the Claymore from its sheath. 7 O spirit of the wind and sky, Where doth thy harp neglected lie; Is there no heart thy bard to be, To wake that soul of melody; Is liberty herself a slave, No God forbids it—on ye brave! July 9?? 1844 TO HIS WIFE 1 In my young days, I pluck't a rose; It grew upon a pleasant tree,— No prickles on its stem arose,— It never wounded me. 2 It grew upon a pleasant spot; On mountain heath so fair, And pleasant was the little cot; Near which it flourished there. 3 I knew it when a blooming bud, Nursed by the morning dew, I knew the cottage where it stood, And beautiful it grew. 4 Flowers on the hills had grown, The woods were all in tune, The bud became full blown; The sweetest rose of June. 5 I saw it every day, A hue that health will seek; There's such a rose in May, Comes on the maidens cheek. 6 I went again in spring; 'Twas somewere near the may, Birds had begun to sing,— When I took the rose away. 7 I planted it with care, I watched it bloom from ill, It scented all the air, And blossoms sweeter still. LOVE'S PAINS 1 This love, I canna' bear it, It cheats me night and day; This love, I canna' wear it, It takes my peace away. 2 This love, wa' once a flower; But now it is a thorn,— The joy o' evening hour, Turn'd to a pain e're morn. 3 This love, it wa' a bud, And a secret known to me; Like a flower within a wood; Like a nest within a tree. 4 This love, wrong understood, Oft' turned my joy to pain; I tried to throw away the bud, But the blossom would remain. July 13?? 1844 LOVE 1 Love is a secret; Like a bird in a shell; Like a rose ere it blossom,— All unseen will it dwell. 2 'Tis the kernel of fruits, The germ of all flowers, The blaze of the diamond, The moment of hours. 3 'Tis the star in night's darkness, The sky in the river, The soul in mans bosom,— That wears it for ever. 4 'Tis a word and the dearest,— Each language has shown; 'Tis a thought the sincerest, Any tongue has made known.— 5 'Tis a flower in a basket,— All bloom and perfuming: 'Tis the gem of the casket, Love, beauty, and woman. I'VE HAD MANY &amp; ?? 1 I've had many an aching pain, A for sake o' somebody: I have talked, but o' in vain, When I thought o' somebody. 2 Nought could please me any where, I could heed nor smile, nor tear; And yet I sighed, for half a year! And that for sake o' somebody. 3 She was like the lily fair, The rose it blushed, for somebody; Her neck was white, her cheek was rare, I wot it smiled on somebody;— 4 Here's good luck to somebody; And best o' health for somebody; The dearest thought I keep mysell, I keep for sake o' somebody. July 17?? 1844. SCOTLAND 1 My heart is in Scotland, wi' nature sae grand, Which seemed to me aince, my ain happy land: When I gazed on the blue lake, and clomb the high brow; It was my ain land then, and sae' it seems now. 2 I lov'd thee auld Scotland;—the mountain and flood; I lov'd the famed spots, where thy standard aince stood; The blood fields of Flodden, and famed Bannockburn; And I wish her foes visits may never return.— 3 I love thee auld Scotland, the mountain and glen, The bonniest o' lasses, and hailest o' men; I love thy scotch beauties, in tartans sae bra, The sweetest o' women, the world ever saw. 4 My heart's in thee Scotland, my heart's I' the north, The birthplace o' valor, the country o' worth; In lands 'yont the sun;—and wherever I rove, Thy health, and prosperity,—'tis Scotland I love. 5 Here's a health to auld Scotland, I ne'er wish her ill, I left her in freedom, and wish her free still; Let her earn her ain living, and wear her ain claes, And her worst lot be still, wi' her second hand faes. July 18?? 1844 HAYMAKING 1 Among the meadow hay cocks 'Tis beautiful to lie When pleasantly the day looks And gold like is the sky 2 How lovely looks the hay-swarth When turning to the sun How richly looks the dark path When the rickings all are done 3 There's nothing looks more lovely As a meadow field in cock There's nothing sounds more sweetly As the evenings six o' clock 4 There's nothing sounds so welcome As their singing at their toil Sweet maidens with tan'd faces And bosoms fit to broil 5 And its beautiful to look on How the hay-cleared meadow lies How the sun pours down his welcome heat Like gold from yonder skies 6 There's a calm upon the level When the sun is getting low Smooth as a lawn is the green level Save where swarths their pointings shew 7 There the mother makes a journey With a babbie at her breast While the sun is fit to burn ye On the sabath day at rest 8 There's nothing like such beauty With a woman ere compares Unless the love within her arms The infant which she heirs. SONG [Sweet the sun shines on the wild heaving sea] 1 Sweet the sun shines on the wild heaving sea; Sweet heaves the wind, oer the dark waving tree; There, sweet the bright sun smiles, There, gladly lorn labour toils, While the sea waves, and boils; All the long day. 2 And hither my Katie roams down the lone glen, 'Mong moor's, and 'mong mountains, and far fra' a men—, Sweet is her shape, and air, O she is more than fair, While the burn' dances there, Down the green brae.— EVENING The cool of evening is the hour of heaven The time earth holds communion with the sky When angels thoughts to evening walks are given And wispering in the hedges round us lie Like heaven talking in our infancy One sweet soft cupola appears the clouds Purple and rose and gold far west doth lie May blossoms on the hedges sleep in crowds And evening rests in days retiring shrouds Days restorative toils repose the hour When infants cradle on the mothers breast Like roses in the dews yet half in flower While day yet lingers in the golden west Beasts to their sheds, the small birds to their nest, Clouds to the trees, dews to the flowers are given The dews like cordials fall on toil and rest The dog-rose glistens wi' the dews of even And peace reposes in the midst of heaven It is the hour the lover meets his heart At least the maid who keeps it in her breast It is the hour that lovers will impart Their heart's own secret 'ere the hour of rest It is the hour the social life likes best When neighbours, children, wife and husband meet The hour when blessings they are doubly bless't The hour when dews are brushed by lovers feet The soft still hour when lov'd and happy meet SONG ‘Thou'rt mine Love’ 1 Thou'rt mine Love, in gladness; In sickness, and sorrow; Oh!—the love of to day, Shall not change with the morrow, While the bright mirror'd sky, Is pourtray'd in the river: While there's light in thine eye, Thou'rt mine love for ever. 2 My delight's in thy keeping, In daylight and gloaming; I dream of thee sleeping, And think of thee roaming. Thou'rt mine love in gladness, In sickness, and sorrow; Oh! the smile of to day, Shall not change with the morrow. July 21?? 1844 SONG O wert thou in the storm 1 O wert thou in the storm, How I would shield thee: To keep thee dry and warm, A camp I would build thee. 2 Though the clouds pour'd again, Not a drop should harm thee; The music of wind, and rain, Rather should charm thee. 3 O wert thou in the storm, A shed I would build thee; To keep thee dry and warm,— How I would shield thee.— 4 The rain should not wet thee, Nor thunder clap harm thee. By thy side I would sit me,— To comfort, and warm thee. 5 I would sit by thy side love, While the dread storm was over;— And the wings of an angel, My charmer would cover. July 25?? 1844 SONG To Harriett 1 The tresses of thy glossy hair, As dark as is the ravens wing; When flying in the sunny air, Beneath the marble clouds of spring: 'Tis dark, nay black, as starless night; Or glossy beauties softest light. 2 The thunder tempest near the sun, Wears awful darkness, on its breast; Thy glossy hair as black, has none,— But softest hues where love could rest. Thy neck, and face, was snowy fair, But beauty was her coal black hair. 3 Like darkness in a sunny sky, It lay upon her neck in light: As black clouds over sunbeams lie; 'Till her white skin, seemed doubly white:— While the rich light in those black eyes, Outshone the sun in summer skies.— FORGET-ME-NOT 1 The blue flower, Forget-me-not: What can it mean love, Growing near the river grot, In meadows green love. 2 The flowers they are heaven's blue, And bright like thee love: When e'er these flowers you view, Then think of me love. 3 In the morning then dearest, Think of me when thou'rt roaming, In the spring meadow, fairest, Or the grove in the gloaming. 4 By the river at noon love, Blue Forget-me-nots see; By the light of the moon love, In its hue think of me: 5 By the sweet walks of evening; By the stars in the sky; By the moon when its beaming; By the sun when its high. 6 Heavens poesy is talking, In the evening of thee; And when thou art walking, Sweet ? think of me. July 28?? 1844. SUSAN DOWN THE LANE 1 Oh! happy memories, what are ye But welcome flowers of spring; The thoughts o' love, and melody, Your early visits bring. I've sung o' maids, and called them flowers; And so I will again,— The sweetest o' the summer hours, Was with Susan down the lane. 2 She's like the hedge rose, white and red, Where spring and summer meet:— The violets by the woodland shed, No flower can be more sweet. Its eye is dew drop's, silver grey, Or blebs of sunny rain.— Yet dearer than these flowers of May, Is Susan down the lane. 3 How sweet the summer flowers appear, In many a secret place: But still the fairest of the year, Is Susan's bonny face: The wild-hedge-rose, is fair and sweet, In a summers shower of rain— But the sweetest flower I e're could meet Was Susan down the lane. 4 Those happy memories summer hours, Those violets of the wood; That hedge of sweet-briar, hung with showers; That by her cottage stood, Than sweet briar hedge, or summer showers, There's one as sweet again: The fairest flower on meads, or bowers, Is Susan down the lane. SONG [Farewell! auld Scotland, hills, and moors] 1 Farewell! auld Scotland, hills, and moors; I bid ye a' farewell! I'm like a Scott; turned out o' doors, In other lands to dwell. Sae mopingly, and hopelessly;— Do I now gang awa', Ye banks, and braes,—I leave mysell, In taking leave of a'—. 2 Farewell to Scotlands hills, that leuk, To hills ayont the sea; Farewell to Scotland, like a beuk; Homes hospitality: Sojourning, and mourning, I leave thy hills, and muirs, And frae the world a brother Scott, I seem turned out of doors. MARY 1 It is the evening hour, How silent all doth lie, The horned moon she shews her face, In the river, with the sky; Just by the path on which we pass, The flaggy lake, lies still, as glass. 2 Spirit of her I love, Wispering to me: Stories of sweet visions, as I rove: Here stop and crop with me, Sweet flowers, that in the still hour grew, We'll take them home, nor shake off the bright dew. 3 Mary, or sweet spirit of thee, As the bright sun shines tomorrow; Thy dark eyes these flowers shall see, Gathered by me in sorrow, In the still hour, when my mind was free, To walk alone—yet wish I walk'd with thee. SONG [The rose of the morning,—] 1 The rose of the morning,— Is laden wi' dew; But the rose o' the evening— Is sweetest to view: At the sweet hour o' sunset, How lovely the gloaming; To watch the young moon set,— Wi' a sweet lassie roaming. 2 Then the thistles hangs cobwebs, The wild brier its dew, While the bee on the knob-weed— Looks drowsily too;— 'Tis sweet at the sunset— O'er the fields to be roaming, And watch the bright moon set— Wi' a lassie at gloaming; 3 How lovely the fields look All beaded wi' dew Sweet the grass in the bield-newk Where the wren hides from view Such scenes have a gem still I love in the gloaming On the green sward I would lie still Or with a lassie be roaming. 4 If she talks very kind too, How sweet is the weather: When we both in a mind go;— Out walking together; The bird on its nest she, Will praise, when we're roaming; The flower I like best she, Will take home at gloaming. 5 The rose of the morning, Is laden wi' dew, But the rose of the evening, Is sweetest to view: At the sweet hour o' sunset,— How sweet in the gloaming; To watch the young moon set, Wi' a sweet lassie roaming. STANZAS [Black absence hides upon the past] 1 Black absence hides upon the past I quite forget thy face And memory like the angry blast Will love's last smile erace I try to think of what has been But all is blank to me And other faces pass between My early love and thee 2 I try to trace thy memory now And only find thy name Those inky lashes on thy brow Black hair, and eyes the same Thy round pale face of snowy dyes There's nothing paints thee there A darkness comes before my eyes For nothing seems so fair 3 I knew thy name so sweet and young 'Twas music to my ears A silent word upon my tongue A hidden thought for years Dark hair and lashes swarthy too Arched on thy forehead pale All else is vanished from my view Like voices on the gale TO MARY 1 I sleep with thee, and wake with thee, And yet thou art not there:— I fill my arms, with thoughts of thee, And press the common air.— Thy eyes are gazing upon mine, When thou art out of sight; My lips are always touching thine, At morning, noon, and night. 2 I think, and speak of other things, To keep my mind at rest: But still to thee, my memory clings, Like love in womans breast;— I hide it from the worlds-wide eye; And think, and speak contrary; But soft, the wind comes from the sky, And wispers tales of Mary.— 3 The night wind wispers in my ear, The moon shines in my face; A burden still of chilling fear, I find in every place.— The breeze is wispering in the bush; And the dew-fall from the tree, All; sighing on, and will not hush, Some pleasant tales of thee.— SONG [Wher hae ye been sae far awae] 1 Wher hae ye been sae far awae My fair creature? I've been by the mountain side Whar the siller burnie glide I've been looking far, and wide Farest creature 2 And what whar ye lurking there Dearest creature I leuk'd ayont the sunny know Where the yellow gowans grow And then she blush'd and turn'd to go Dearest creature 3 And what gaed ye, to leuk for there My fairest creature I gaed to leuk ayont the know For aine I saw some days ago In tartan plaid fra' top to toe And brown his feature 4 He leuk'd sa' kind the tother e'en And said fair creature My heart leap'd fra' my bosom clean I blush'd but it whar a' unseen As mountain brere that blooms at e'en Brown whar his feature 5 Then I'm the leuky mon to sae Fairest creature That bright ene I think on't well I clasp'd her waist 'twas me mysell What I might do, I may not tell I kiss'd the fairest creature Aug?? 20?? 1844 A VISION 1 I lost the love, of heaven above; I spurn'd the lust, of earth below; I felt the sweets of fancied love,— And hell itself my only foe. 2 I lost earths joys, but felt the glow, Of heaven's flame abound in me: 'Till loveliness, and I did grow, The bard of immortality. 3 I loved, but woman fell away; I hid me, from her faded fame: I snatch'd the sun's eternal ray,— And wrote 'till earth was but a name. 4 In every language upon earth, On every shore, o'er every sea; I gave my name immortal birth, And kep't my spirit with the free. Augst 2?? 1844 SONG [The bearded rye was in the row] 1 The bearded rye was in the row, The lintel in the pod; No grass without its sod did grow, No peas without a pod. Between the Lammas open tide,— And harvest getting in, When Jockey walked by Jenny's side, His courting to begin. 2 My dear saith he you are sa sweet, Your face it is sa fair,— Your bonnet bow is tied so neat, I'm in love I do declair. Here Jenny love, and dot no sin, That rye is in the ear,— And e're it comes in ear again, Shall I have o'at to fear?— 3 Na' Jockey lad your tongue's o'er glib, Such things I dinna tell, Your pen will want a better knib, To write love-letters well.— I know the rye is in the ear, But that I canna tell, For what may hap anether year,— Are secrets to my sell. 4 But Jenny love is like the bloom, Of these sweet simmer flowers; And if na' more the like should come, Where leuk for happy hours.— War' these same fields o' corn and rye, The last that would be sown;— War my last hopes o' thee to die; Where would my joy be known. 5 Then Jenny answered Jockey well; And waited no reply, My joy I make to please my sell,— Nor loose it all to sigh.— There's mony a harvest to be met,— And other fields o' rye: And I'm o'er young to marry yet, But I'll do't before I die. THE MAID OF JERUSALEM 1 Maid of Jerusalem, by the Dead Sea I wandered all sorrowful thinking of thee;— Thy city in ruins; thy kingdom deplored,— All fallen and lost by the Ottoman's sword. 2 I saw thee sit there in disconsolate sighs Where the hall of thy father's a ruined heap lies; Thy fair fingers shewed me the place where they trod In thy childhood, when flourished the kingdom of God. 3 The place where they fell, and the scenes where they lie, In the tombs of Siloa;—(the tear in her eye She stifled,—transfix'd there, it grew like a pearl, Beneath the dark lash of the sweet Jewish girl). 4 Jerusalem is fallen;—still thou art in bloom, As fresh as the ivy around the lone tomb, And fair as the lily of morning that waves Its sweet scented bells o'er the desolate graves. 5 When I think of Jerusalem in kingdoms yet free, I shall think of its ruins, and think upon thee, Thou beautiful Jewess!—content thou may'st roam, A bright spot in Eden still blooms as thy home.— A VALENTINE 1 Here's a valentine nosegay for Mary, Some of springs early flowers; The ivy is green by the dairy, And so are these laurels of ours.— Though the snow fell so deep, and the winter was dreary, The laurels are green, and the sparrows are cheery. 2 The snowdrops in bunches grow under the rose; And aconites under the lilac like fairies; The best in the bunches for Mary I chose;— Their looks are as sweet, and as simple as Mary's; The one will make spring, in my verses so bare, The other will set off, and braid thy dark hair. 3 Red primroses too, at the old parlour end, Have bloom'd all the winter, ‘mid’ snow's cold and dreary, Where the lavender cotton kept off the cold wind Now to shine in my Valentine nosegay for Mary. And shine in my verses all summer and be, A memento of fondness, and friendship for thee. 4 Here's the crocus half opened, that spreads into gold; Like branches of sunbeams left there by a fairy, I pluck them as such, in these verses so cold, But they'l bloom twice as bright, in the presence of Mary. These garden flowers cropt, I will go to the fields, And see what the valleys and pasture land yields. 5 Here's the pale primrose, on the skirts of the wild wood, And violet blue, 'neath the thorn on the green: The wild flowers we pluck't, in the days of our childhood, On the very same spot, as no changes had been! In the very same place, where the sun kiss'd the leaves, And the woodbine its branches, with thorns interweaves. 6 And here in the pasture all swarming with rushes, Is a cowslip, as blooming and forward as spring, And the pilewort like sunshine, glows under the bushes While the chaffinch there sitting is trying to sing. And the daisies are comeing, called ‘stars of the earth’; To bring to the school-boy his spring time of mirth. 7 Here is the nosegay—how simple it shines, It speaks without words, to the ear and the eye: The flowers of the spring, are the best Valentines, They are young, fair, and simple, and pleasingly shy. That you may remain so, and ne'er act contrary, I send you these flowers, as a Valentine Mary. APRIL 1 In April time, flowers come like dreams;— The nightingales, and cuckoo's sing,— The may-fly setling on the streams, Makes wrinkles with its russet wing:— The rivers sedge is sprouting green, The mare-blobs are in burnished gold, The daisies spread about the green, And all is lovely to behold.— 2 The skylark winnows in the air, And cheers the valley with his song; The slopes are green, the scene is fair, And herd-boys whistle all day long. The ash tree's they are full of flower, The fallen ones float on the stream; The sun through haze like misty shower, Shines warmly on the lovely scene. 3 The meadows they are emerald green, The river sparkles with the light;— Like snow storms are the orchard seen;— The fields are with daisies white, The buttercups are buds of green;— That bye-and bye-are flowers of Gold, The fields look warm, the air serene, And all is lovely to behold. 4 'Tis spring the april of the year, The holiday of birds and flowers, Some build ere yet the leaves appear, While others wait for safer hours:— Hid in green leaves that shun the shower, They're safe and happy all along— The meanest weed now finds a flower, The simplest bird will learn a song. EVENING 1 'Tis evening, the black snail has got on his track, And gone to its nest is the wren;— And the packman snail too, with his home on his back; Clings on the bowed bents like a wen. 2 The shepherd has made a rude mark with his foot, Where his shaddow reached when he first came; And it just touched the tree where his secret love cut, Two letters that stand for love's name. 3 The evening comes in with the wishes of love;— And the shepherd he looks on the flowers;— And thinks who would praise the soft song of the dove, And meet joy in these dewfalling hours. 4 For nature is love, and the wishers of love; When nothing can hear or intrude; It hides from the eagle, and joins with the dove: In beautiful green solitude. THE WALK 1 The lonesome wood anemonie, Now trembles in the gale; And bows in wood, and meadow lea, Like maidens all so pale. So Mary let the flowers be thine, And we'll together go Where they in quaking clusters shine, And brimming rivers flow.— 2 The beauties they of early spring, A fairer beauty thou: We'll gather them as fairy things, To deck thy lovely brow, We'll wander by the river side; With waters flowing o'er: We'll trace the marshes far and wide, And talk love stories o'er. 3 For there's the bright-march-marygold Like sun-rays from the west, They'll shine like gold in thy black hair; Or broach upon thy breast. And though the stooping willow tree, Shews not one leaf of gray, The grassy sward has charms for thee, And sunny is the day. 4 So come my dearest Mary Ann, And meet the morning air; The larks are doing all they can, To cheer thee, young, and fair;— We'll crop the large marsh marygold, And wood anemonie; Sweet is the morning, free from cold, And music's in each tree. SONG [There's not a land the sea surrounds] 1 There's not a land the sea surrounds, Sung by a thousand pens; Or classic waters, classic grounds; Like Scotland's bonny glens, The valleys where the poet roams; Each beacon lighted hill; Her Scottish hearts, and Scottish homes; Are green, and welcome still. 2 There's many maids in foreign vales, That it were well to shun; But Scottish maids, in Scottish tales,— Beat all beneath the sun;— My boyhood saw them by the streams, By vale, and naked hill;— And still they haunt my manhoods dreams,— Sweet, green, and welcome still— SPRING VIOLETS 1 Push that rough maple bush aside, Its bark is all ridgy—and naked beside; But it stands in the way of the flowers that engross My eye—in bloom, by its stump of green moss: How green is the moss, and how purple the flower, I'll not pluck thee, sweet violets in thy own sheltered bower! 2 The first sunny days, they were nought but green leaves, When the bush, threw another bush, on the dead leaves; So perfect, and true, and such shadows I love, That it seemed an ink-drawing, of the maple above: The moss it looks greener, the flowers are so blue While the gold sun of spring looks delightfully through. 3 There's no flowers more red, than the flower of the larch, And none are so sweet as the violets of march; In their dead leafy beds, how intensely dark blue, By the moss maple stump, where the sunlight looks through: Those sweet flowers that look up, in their beautiful bloom, Will ne'er live to see the bright maple leaves come. THE DRONEING BEE 1 The droneing bee has wakened up, And humming round the buttercup: And round the bright star daisy hums;— O'er every blade of grass he passes— The dew-drop shines like looking glasses; In every drop a bright sun comes:— 'Tis march, and spring, bright days we see,— Round every blossom hums the bee. 2 As soon as daylight in the morning, The crimson curtains of the dawning,— We hear, and see, the humming bee,— Searching for hedge row violets, Happy with the food he gets:— Swimming o'er brook, and meadow lea;— Then sits on maple stools at rest, On the green mosses velvet breast. 3 About the molehill, round, and round, The wild bee hums with honied sound,— Singing a song, of spring, and flowers,— To school-boys heard in sunny hours. When all the waters seem a blaze, Of fire, and sunshine in such days; When bee's buzz on with coal black eye; Joined by the yellow butterfly. 4 And when it comes, a summer shower; It still will go from flower, to flower; Then underneath the rushes,— It sees the silver daisy flower, And there it spends a little hour Then hides among the bushes But whence they come from, where they go None but the wiser schoolboy's know. TO THE LARK Bird of the morn When roseate clouds begin To shew the opening dawn Thy singing does begin &amp; oer the sweet green fields &amp; happy vales Thy pleasant song is heard mixed with the morning gales Bird of the morn What time the ruddy sun Smiles on the pleasant corn Thy singing is begun Heartfelt &amp; cheering over labours toil Who chop in coppice wild &amp; delve the russet soil Bird of the sun How beautifull art thou When morning has begun To gild the mountains brow How beautifull it is to see thee soar so blest Winnowing thy russet wings above thy twitchy nest Bird of the summers day How oft I stand to hear Thee sing thy airy way With music wild &amp; clear Till thou becomes a speck upon the sky Small as those clods that crumble where I lye Thou bird of happiest song The spring &amp; summer too Is thine the months along The woods &amp; vales to view If climes were ever green thy song would be The sunny music of eternal glee SONNET [Enough of misery keeps my heart alive] Enough of misery keeps my heart alive To make it feel more mental agony Till even life itself becomes all pain And bondage more than hell to keep alive And still I live, nor murmer nor complain Save that the bonds which hold me may make free My lonely solitude, and give me rest When every foe hath ceased to trouble me On the soft throbbings of a womans breast Where love and truth and feeling live confest The little cottage with those bonds of joy My family—lifes blood within my breast Is not more dear—than is each girl and boy Which time matures and nothing can destroy. JESSY 1 When the sabbath it comes to the green The maidens are there in their best But Jessy is not to be seen Though I walk till the sun's in the west I fancy still each wood and plain Where I and Jessy strayed Then I was a country swain And she a happy maid 2 But woods and wilds are lonely now Their wild flowers blow unseen The birds sing lone upon the bough Where Jessy once had been But now through months she keeps away And I am lone behind Trees tell me so from day to day When waving in the wind 3 Birds tell me so upon the bough That I'm threadbare now and old The very sun looks on me now A being dead and cold I had a place where I could rest And love and quiet be That quiet place was Jessy's breast And still a hope to me 4 The spring comes brighter day by day And brighter flowers appear And though she ever keeps away Her name is ever here Jessy's love is so dear to my bosom I wonder what tempts her to stay The white thorn will soon be in blossom And we may be married by May SONNET [Poets love nature, and themselves are love] Poets love nature, and themselves are love; The scorn of fools, and mock of idle pride The vile in nature worthless deeds approve They court the vile, and spurn all good beside Poets love nature, like the calm of heaven Her gifts like heaven's love spread far and wide In all her works there are no signs of leaven Sorrow abashes from her simple pride Her flowers like pleasures have their seasons birth And bloom through region[s] here below They are her very scriptures upon earth And teach us simple mirth where e'er we go Even in prison they can solace me For where they bloom God is, and I am free. MARY 1 'Tis April and the morning love Awakes in balmy dew Flowers are the meads adorning love In yellow white and blue And if thy heart is true my love As true it used to be Then leave thy cot and kye my love And walk the fields with me 2 And we will walk the meadow love And we will walk the grove And by the winding river love We'll walk and talk of love And by the white thorn bushes love Just budding into green Where the shaded fountain rushes love We'll steal a kiss unseen 3 Where the daisey on the brink my love Stands peeping in the flood And the blackcap flies to drink my love That whistles in the wood Where the crowflower like the sun my love Shines in the grass so green Let's go where waters run my love And live and love unseen 4 And live and love unseen my dear For one sweet April day Drear winter seems to last a year While Mary is away Where we can see and not be seen By woods or shady grove Or by the hawthorn's tender green Let's meet, and live and love THE SKYLARK 1 Although I am in prison Thy song is uprisen And singing away to the cloud In the blueness of morn Over fields of green corn With a song sweet rural and loud 2 When the day is serenest When the corn is the greenest Thy bosom mounts up to the light And sings in the sun Like a vision begun Of Pleasure and lonely delight 3 The daiseys they whiten Plains where the suns brighten And warmeth thy nest where thy russet eggs lie From whence thou'rt now springing And the air it is ringing To show that the minstrel of spring is on high 4 The cornflower is blooming The cowslip is coming And many new buds on the silken grass lie On the earth's grassy breast Thou hast left thy brown nest And towering above it a speck in the sky 5 Thou'rt the herald of sunshine And the soft dewy moonshine Gilds sweetly the sleep of thy brown speckled breast Thou'rt the bard of the spring On thy brown russet wing And of each grassy close thou'rt the poet and guest 6 There's the violet confiding In the mossy wood riding And primrose beneath the old thorn in the glen And daiseys that go to bed In the old sheltered homestead Old friends with old faces I see them again 7 And thou feathered poet I see thee, and know it Thou'rt one of the minstrels that cheered me last spring With nature thou'rt blest And green grass round thy nest Will keep thee still happy to mount up and sing THE HEATH 1 I love the heath, where spring had used to lie,— In boyhood 'neath her aromatic showers; Where maidens walked so beautifully shy,— Akin to nothing but the blooming flowers. 2 The rabits from the furze would squat, and run; The daiseys filling every open space; And crowds of kingcups golden as the sun, Shone on the molehills of that happy place.— FLOWERS AND SPRING 1 And has the spring's all glorious eye, No lesson to the mind? The birds that cleave the golden sky, Things to the earth resigned; Wild flowers that dance to every wind, Do they no memory leave behind? 2 Aye flowers, the very name of flowers, That bloom in wood and glen; Bring spring to me in winter hours, And childhoods dreams again: The primrose on the woodland lea, Was more than wealth, and gold to me. 3 The violets by the woodland side, As thick as they could snive, Ive talked to them with childish pride, As things that were alive. I find them now in mans distress, They seem as sweet, yet valueless. 4 The cowslips on the meadow lea, How have I run for them: I looked with wild and childish glee, Upon each golden gem: And when they bowed their heads so shy, I laughed and thought they danced for joy. 5 And when a man, in early years, How sweet they used to come; And give me tales of smiles and tears, And thoughts more dear than home: Secrets which words would then reprove, They told the names of early love. 6 The primrose turned a babbling flower, Within its sweet recess: I blushed to see their secret bower, And turned her name to bless. The violet said the eyes were blue, I loved, and did they tell me true? 7 The cowslip in meadows every where,— My hearts own thoughts would steal. I nip't them 'cause they should not hear; They smiled, and would reveal. And o'er each meadow right or wrong; They sing the name I've worshiped long. 8 The brooks that mirrored clear the sky, Full well I know the spot. The mouse ear looked with bright blue eye, And said forget me not. And from the brook I turn'd away, But heard it many an after day. 9 The kingcup on its slender stalk, Within the pasture dell; Would picture there a pleasant walk, With one I loved so well. They said how sweet at eventide, 'Twould be with true love at thy side. 10 And on the pastures woody knoll, I saw the wild blue-bell; On sundays when I used to stroll, With her I loved so well. She culled their flowers the year before, These bowed, and told the story o'er. 11 And every flower, that had a name, Would tell me who was fair, But those without, as strangers came, And blossomed silent there: I stood to hear but all alone, They bloomed and kept their thoughts unknown. 12 But seasons now have nought to say, The flowers no news to bring; Alone I live from day to day, Flowers seem the bier of spring; And birds upon the bush, or tree, All sing a different tale to me! SWEET JESSY 1 Winter is nearly spent And gone to the desert of gloom Sweet spring her heralds hath sent Gay flowers in the valley to bloom Where the sun turns to gold on the grass And the flowers turn to stars in the night The land and the sea and the air Bids welcome to spring coming there And my heart biddeth welcome to thee my delight Sweet Jessy 2 I knew her in her childhood In scenes from strife and noise When singing to the wild wood Tales and songs of childish joys Making playmates of flowers as she lay And talking to birds as they flew O'er the molehill of thyme all the day Her voice and her features were known I went up and called her mine own Sweet Jessy 3 Thou'rt as young in mine eye As thy bridal day smile In my heart thou shalt lie Though the world may beguile The dreams of thy childhood are dearest to me And the very night smiles with the memory of thee Sweet Jessy THE RAREE SHOW 1 God bless us theres a mort to do 'Bout Princes, and 'bout Queens Let's go and see the raree show And tell 'em what it means 'Twas thus to Richard Robin sed And Robin made reply I'll think on't when I go to bed Sed Richard so will I 2 When morning came they both agree'd To leave the village green And see the sights of which we read About the Prince and Queen They went—and such a mort o' sights And such a mort of shows They stayed till all the lamps and lights Shone in the streets in rows 3 They saw flags stuck wi' evergreen All gilt wi' crowns and names Dick vowed the like wor never seen And Bob he thought the same And there wor V's, and there wor R's [A hangin' on the lamps] Bob sed they told o' bludy wars But them's the tales o' scamps 4 Arches were stuck wi' evergreens Up to the very top At Christmas time there may be seen The like in Grocer's shop And lots of letters for the name Of but a Prince and Queen, Some yellow as the very flame The like o't ne'er wor seen 5 A roozin bonfire blazed at night Fire-works were blazing too 'Twould sarv'd our house for candle light For half the winter through And there wor fireworks on the hill And crackers in the street I see the bonfires blazing still And faces I did meet 6 And there were morts o' things beside I can't think on't to tell If they be Queen's and aint no pride I on'y wish them well The women they did gaily shine Our Nan has no sich clothes Misses on Sundays ben't so fine As Queen's and Albert's shows 7 Some sez they beint the Prince and Queen And some pretends they be I cam to see what's to be seen And mort o' sights I see And if I see the Queen agen And ne'er o sight be seen I've got a voice like other men To say God save the Queen A SCENE 1 The winding river glitters Through the meadows emerald green And in the sunshine twitters How beautiful the scene And April just a leafing And the willows greening grey While the white-thorn's sweetly weaving Beneath the naked spray 2 Its tender leaves of green O'er every hill and vale Then comes the pleasant scene Of maid with milking pail The soft winds blowing over us Woods waving too and fro Soon spring's green leaves will cover us Wherever we may go SONG [I seek her in the shady grove] 1 I seek her in the shady grove, And by the silent stream; I seek her where my fancies rove, In many a happy dream: I seek her where I find her not, In spring and summer weather,— My thoughts paint many a happy spot, But we ne'er meet together. 2 The trees and bushes speak my choice; And in the summer shower, I often hear her pleasant voice, In many a silent hour. I see her in the summer brook; In blossoms sweet and fair, In every pleasant place I look, My fancy paints her there. 3 The wind blows through the forest tree, And cheers the pleasant day. There her sweet voice is sure to be, To lull my cares away:— The very hedges find a voice, So does the gurgling rill: But still the object of my choice, Is lost and abscent still. A LAMENT 1 The sun looks from a cloudy sky, On yellow bleaching reeds.— The river streams run muddy by, Among the flags and reeds. And nature seems so lost and coy, All silent and alone; Left here without a single joy, Or love to call my own. 2 How mournful now the river seems, Adown the vale to run; That ran so sweet in my young dreams, And glittered in the sun. Now cold and dead, the meadow lies, And muddy runs the stream: The lark on drooping pinion flies,— And spoiled is pleasures dream. 3 The wind comes moaning through the trees,— No maiden passes by. And all the summer melodies,— Are uttered in a sigh. On many a knoll I set me down, Beneath a silent sky, And of the past all seem to frown, And pass in sorrow by. TO HIS WIFE 1 Thou sunshine in my calmer sky, Thou true-love in my vacant eye; Where can I fly when lost to thee, In this dark vale of misery. Thou needle to my hapless north, Thou sweet perrenial flower: 'Twas heaven that brought thy being forth, To grace my lonely bower. 2 There is a spot, a lovely spot, Where all my cares would be forgot: A place where I should then be free,— With truth, and friendship, love and thee. There I could find a home still free,— From every weary care; How rough so e'er lifes storms might be, My heart could shelter there. SONG [A seaboy on the giddy mast] A seaboy on the giddy mast Sees nought but ocean waves &amp; hears the wild inconstant blast Where loud the tempest raves My life is like the ocean wave &amp; like the inconstant sea In every hope appears a grave &amp; leaves no hope for me My life is like the oceans lot Bright gleams the morning gave But storms oerwhelmed the sunny spot Deep in the ocean wave My life hath been the ocean storm A black &amp; troubled sea When shall I find my life a calm A port &amp; harbour free SONG [The daiseys golden eye] The daiseys golden eye On the fallow land doth lie Though the spring is just begun Pewets watch it all the day &amp; the sky larks nest of hay Leans agen its group of leaves in the sun Theres the pilewort all in gold Neath that ridge of finest mould Blooms to cheer the ploughmans eye There the mouse his hole hath made &amp; beneath its golden shade Hides secure when the hawk is prowling bye Heres the speedwells sapphire blue Was there anything more true To the vernal season still Here it decks the bank alone Where the milkmaid throws a stone At morn to cross the flooded rill Here the cowslap chill with cold On the rushy bed behold Looking for [the] spring all day Where the heavy bee will come &amp; find no sweets at home Then quakes his weary wings &amp; flyes away &amp; here are nameless flowers Culled from cold &amp; rawky hours For Marys happy home They grew in murky blea Rush fields &amp; naked lea But suns will shine &amp; pleasing spring will come SONG [Sweet summer breath your choicest gales] Sweet summer breath your choicest gales To charm my lovers ear Ye zephers wake your choicest tales Where e'er she shall appear &amp; gently wave the meadow grass Where soft she sets her feet For my love is a country lass &amp; bonny as shes sweet The hedges only seem to mourn The willow boughs to sigh Though sunshine on the meads sojourn To cheer me where I lye The blackbird in the hedge row thorn Sings loud his summer lay He seems to sing both eve &amp; morn She wanders here to day The skylark in the summer cloud One cheering anthem sings &amp; Mary where she wanders out Can watch his trembling wings Let zephers throw their sighs away When woman comes abroad To cheer the landscape all the day Such glooms are ill bestowed I'll wander down the river way, And wild flower poesys make; For nature wispers all the day,— She can't her promise break. The meads already wear a smile; The river runs more bright; For down the path and o'er the stile,— The maiden comes in sight. The scene begins to look divine, We'll by the river walk; Her arm already seems in mine, And fancy hears her talk: A vision this of early love, The meadow, river,—rill.— Scenes where I walked with Mary Dove, Are in my memory still. AUTUMN 1 The autumn day it fades away, The fields are wet and dreary; The rude storm takes the flowers of may, And nature seemeth weary. The partridge coveys shunning fate, Hide in the bleaching stubble; And many a bird without its mate, Mourns o'er its lonely trouble. 2 On awthorns shine the crimson awe, Where spring brought may-day blossoms; Decay is natures cheerless law, Life's winter in our bosoms. The fields are brown and naked all, But hedges still are green: But storms shall come at autumns fall, And not a leaf be seen! 3 Yet happy love that warms the heart, Through darkest storms severe; Keeps many a tender flower to start,— When spring shall reappear, Affections hope shall roseys meet; Like those of summer bloom:— And joys, and flowers, smell as sweet, In seasons yet to come. THE CHURCHYARD 1 ‘The graves of those we loved’, How beautiful they lie; From every care and strife removed; Beneath heavens canopy. 2 Think of the hand that led you on, In childhoods happy way; A guide where 'ere your steps have gone, That would not lead astray! 3 The father is a real friend, The mother something more, And when the churchyard holds them both, The hope of life is o'er! 4 The maiden when she leaves the church, Stands where the nettles wave; Upon a mound against the porch, —It is her mothers grave! 5 The brother looks among the tombs, His sisters name to see; Gone like a blossom just in bloom, How beautiful was she! 6 The stone with sculpture spread about From fondest love was given. But dear the mounds of those without, In memories of the living. 7 And o'er her brother's grave—(that was.) The sister bending sighs, While like the dew drops in the grass, Tears glisten in her eyes! 8 A small low stone denotes the spot,— The little mound is green; Strangers go by and notice not,— There sleeps the ‘village queen’. 9 A sweetheart's name reposes there, Beneath that little stone; To one, o' she was more than fair; And dearer now she's gone! 10 These resting places of the dead, How beautiful they lie; The green grass turf above them spread, Beneath a summer sky. SONG—MISS HAND In this summers health &amp; dew Among the oaks &amp; flowers ‘When looks were fond &amp; words were few’ Canst thou remember hours Spent there in love &amp; happiness Beneath the clear blue sky When natures truth had power to bless &amp; nought gave cause to sigh The song thats breathed from lips we love There nought so sweet can prove The voice like angels songs above There's nought so sweet but love The walk at morn the seat at eve The rest on hillocks green There love leaves many an happy place To think of what has been To think of when we get away &amp; so I've thought of thee How sweet appeared that summers day When thou as fair as May Went with me through that happy scene An angel by my side How beautifull the park—how green The oaks spread far &amp; wide &amp; we were known beyond the sea &amp; loved in other tongues &amp; there thou wert as dear to me As beauty is in songs The seat at noon the walk at eve On molehills by the rill So fond to stay so loath to leave Are all in memory still STANZAS [There is a hope for all who live] 1 There is a hope for all who live Beneath this cold and cloudy sky And many a joy that hope can give Is dround in many a tearful eye There is a hope of joyful sound 'Tis not in earth, in air, or sky Go search the fields and mountains round There nothing can the loss supply 2 I trace the meadows every day I climb the mountains once in three But still my eyes are all astray For hopeful love ne'er comes to me No matter for the songs I've sung No matter for my being free My hopeless nerves are all unstrung For love, nor pleasure comes to me SUMMER 1 The water elder is in flower, The woods are all in green; The dark oak forms a shady bower, And lovely is the scene. 2 The wild flower of the summer fields, Clothes every swelling hill; And angels voices seem to shield, In murmurs of the rill, 3 That whimpers o'er its winding source, As clear as morning showers, Where grass and weeds grow rank and coarse; And crouds of watered flowers. 4 The fallen oak stripped of its bark, In the wood valley lies; Where dropping down the woodland lark, Sings summer melodies. SPRING 1 'Tis glorious spring; I sit me down, 'Neath the horse-chesnuts blossomed bough; The wheat looks dark upon the hill, The men are singing at the plough; The nettles flower beside the wall; The daiseys spread upon the green; The landrail starts his wonted call; And every where the spring is seen. 2 The hemlocks in the woodland hedge, Are mounting to the awthorn bowers; Where white may comes a certain pledge, With kingcups, and with daisey flowers; In which the ewes and lambs abide, How beautiful the pictures seem, Sweet gardens stretching far and wide; The very hedges seem to dream. 3 The trees in leaf hide every town; The winter scenes are all away: And where the fallow lands look brown, The ploughman whistles half the day, The heaths turn gold, the furze in flower, The furze larks chirrup on the wing; And every day, and every hour, Comes with the beautiful of spring. SONNET [The flag top quivers in the breeze] The flag top quivers in the breeze, That sighs among the willow trees: In gentle waves the river heaves, That sways like boats the lily leaves: The bent grass trembles, as with cold; And crow flowers nod their cups of gold, Till every dew-drop in them found, Is gently shook upon the ground. Each wild weed, by the river side, In different motions dignified, Bows to the wind, quakes to the breeze, And charms sweet summers harmonies. The very nettle quakes away, To glad the summers happy day. SONG [I sing no songs, to make thee grieve] 1 I sing no songs, to make thee grieve, I bring no cares for thy decay; But still the happiest wishes weave, That all thy life were May!— 2 And thou should'st flourish like a flower, A blossom by the brooklets side; Thy life should be a rosy bower, With nought to wish beside. 3 Thy life should be a happy dream, Without a care or strife. And thou the sweetest picture seem, That ever breathed this life. 4 She passed and turned a steady smile, She looked on me with steadfast eye, I loved in silence, all the while: And silent blessed her, passing bye; 5 She shewed me where her thoughts had been, She shewed me where her heart would be; And though true love would keep unseen, I blessed her silently. SONG [O come to the meadows my beautiful fair] 1 O come to the meadows my beautiful fair, With eye-brows so arching, and beautiful hair! No eye e'er would hurt thee, no tongue would upbraid, Nor hurt the sweet face of my beautiful maid. 2 Let us walk the green lanes where I met thy sweet looks And at eve' seek the meadows, and walk by the brooks Thy eye-brows so arching need ne'er be afraid Tho' I clasp to my arms my beautiful maid. 3 How sweet will the walk be in such a sweet place While the setting sun leaves his last smile on thy face, That eye-brow so arching, that bosom so fair Thy sweet slender shape, and thy dark flowing hair. 4 The evening will come like a bird from the west And bring to thy bosom, both pleasure and rest And I'll roam with thee maiden, and ne'er be afraid To kiss the pale cheek of my beautiful maid. SONG [In bed she like a lily lay] 1 In bed she like a lily lay Her sleep it heaved in happy sighs A dream upon her lips did play And sunrise hid within her eyes Like lily leaves her white eye-lids With jetty fringes o'er them lies And each improper gaze forbids From all who would their sleep surprise 2 And when she 'woke to see the morn No rose in June was e're so fair Her bosom blushed right through the lawn As if her bonny breasts were bare The mole it was a beauty spot And glowed like sunlight from her face That waking look is ne'er forgot The room was Venus dwelling place 3 The rose is but a simple flower Compared to living blooms like these They have no strength they have no power They stir not heart's hid ecstacies The lily is a lovely flower The rose it is the gardens queen So blossomed in her bridal hour The loved and lovely Imogene OUT OF DOOR PLEASURES The day is all round me the woods and the fields And sweet is the singing their birds music yields The waterfall music, there's none such at home It spreads like a sheet, and then falls into foam The meadows are mown, what a beautiful hue There is in green closes as I wander through A green of all colors, yellow, brown and dark grey While the footpaths all darkly goes winding away Creeping on to a foot-brig that crosses a brook Or a gate, or a stile, and how rustic they look Some leaning so much that the maidens will go Lower down with their buckets, and try to creep through There is nothing more sweet in the fields and the sun Than those dear little footpaths that o'er the fields run They lead us by maidens all making of hay While we seem to steal kisses as we bid them good day They lead us to springs with a stone by the brink All ready to kneel on, to stoop down and drink They lead us by bushes, all bowering and sweet Where the wild thyme has cushioned mole-hills for a seat And the wild thyme smells sweet, as we sit by the stile And the green-linnet keeps on her nest all the while The road smokes with dust as the oxen and sheep Go mile after mile 'till they scarcely can creep A hugh cloud of dust all the coaches conceals They are hid in the smoak that flies up from the wheels The dust like a cloud whirleth up all the day As coaches and coaches keep flying away Here nothing in nature displeases the eye Out of doors there's the fields and the beautiful sky There's the weeds by the hedge and the flowers in the grass And everything pleases, wherever we pass This grove of tall elms with their dark sombre green How sweet their old shadows beneath them are seen In the heat of the day how delicious to pass As cool as an ice house, or the dews on the grass Where every where else, it is scorching, and sear But here it is pleasant throughout the whole year The closes are mown, and the haytime is done And the stacks stand about bleaching brown in the sun The naked shorn sheep, and the sleek looking cows Are turned in the eddish in quiet to browse Out of doors we see nothing but pleasure and good 'Tis the greenness of childhood in valley and wood Good health out of doors is all that we see Where nature and quiet are happy and free Oh! there's nought so delightful as the woods and the fields And the out-of-doors pleasures their sweet music yields. O powers of mans destiny give me but these With my wife and my children at evening to please. SONG To his Wife 1 O Mary in the silent hour Still let my memory dwell Thy face was like the lily flower Thy eye the young gazelle— 2 I look on pleasures that have been I look on things that are In every place and every scene And nothing find but care 3 There's something in thine arching brow So beautifully fair It even warms my bosom now To feel my home is there 4 So Mary in thy silent thoughts Still keep a place for me Then is my prison kindly bought And happy shall I be SONG [The morning mist is changing blue] 1 The morning mist is changing blue Like smoke among the bushes The one arched brig shines clearly through Near beds of water rushes The cows lie in the pasture fair And maids the hay was turning When a maid went by with inky hair As bonny as the morning. 2 Her face was smiling like the sun Her bosom swelled a treasure She looked—my heart was fairly won I felt both pain and pleasure But pain I know can soon be well Old friendships are sincerest And for my life I cannot tell Which feeling was the dearest. 3 How bright the day how clear the sky How sweet the woods were waving The river ran as gently by The waterfall was raving All nature in her sweetest dress Was still but sweetly dawning That day the happiest maid went by As bonny as the morning. SONG [Sweet lassie I will gang wi' thee] 1 Sweet lassie I will gang wi' thee Where muircock crows and plovers cry A mountain side our hame shall be Na troubles never clamb sae high We'll keep our rash thacked biggin warm Wi' luv' and truth and harmless joy Nor fear na' ills fra flud nor storm Can e're the biggin roof destroy 2 And we wud live like twa true duvs And peck our little up together Our only pillow should be love Where we wud kiss wi' ain another The morning sun our cloak would be And we'd step down amang the heather Till e'ening sun sets o'er the sea And then we'd cuddle clos' together 3 And by our ingle sit at rest And hear the storm beat by the door While neet cam bulging up the west Black rock clouds stretched fra' shore to shore Then gang to bed and lie till morn The starm still keepin' up a swither Thy breasties whiter than blown thorn I'd press and kiss them both together 4 I'd hear the[e] tak' thy breath sa sweet Thy breastie panting like a bird Thy eyelids closed to shut out neet Thy muvin lips that speak na' word I'd see thee sleep in innocense Then wake and huggle ain anither An' wisper words o' common sense As we would cuddle close together 5 Sweet lassie I will gang wi' thee Where muircocks crow an' plovers fly On some high hill agen the sea W'ell mak' a biggin snug and dry And on thy bosom, a' my ain I'll sleep an' we will lie together The earth's vain cares shall be unknown W'ell live like twa true doves together 6 And when death comes to part us twa As many lang sin' syne has parted We've lived to gang the better way And loved in truth that can't be thwarted Shud I gang first I'll luik for thee In faith earths faults are a forgiven If my luv' thou could na be The happiest place cud na' be heaven AN INVITE TO ETERNITY 1 Wilt thou go with me sweet maid Say maiden wilt thou go with me Through the valley depths of shade Of night and dark obscurity Where the path hath lost its way Where the sun forgets the day Where there's nor life nor light to see Sweet maiden wilt thou go with me 2 Where stones will turn to flooding streams Where plains will rise like ocean waves Where life will fade like visioned dreams And mountains darken into caves Say maiden wilt thou go with me Through this sad non-identity Where parents live and are forgot And sisters live and know us not 3 Say maiden wilt thou go with me In this strange death of life to be To live in death and be the same Without this life, or home, or name At once to be, &amp;

THE SUN 1 Grand source of life and light Thou land of gold In heaven's ether bright A mistery to behold Before creations birth Thy light might be begun Lighting another earth Inimitable sun 2 Nay his heat these summer days May other spheres create And new stars distant rays May yet his light await The birth of new come flowers May be this day begun To ope' in distant hours Neath the prolific sun 3 Is he the ‘Lord of light’ Is he the ‘great supreme’ In selfish eyes he might Who mock the seraphim Who scans the author right Will darker errors shun And feel that power above more bright Can mar that glorious sun 4 Ere Adam he was made Or Eve beheld the light That sun dispelled night's shade And shon in heaven as bright As it is shining now In the same course to run On grass and woodland bough Bright, burning, glorious sun 5 I see him shine to day How bright his disk appears Six thousand mark his stay Perhaps a million years And still keeps shining on Bright as when first begun When a thousand years are gone 'Twill be the same bright sun MORNING The morning comes—the drops of dew Hang on the grass and bushes too The sheep more eager bite the grass Whose moisture gleams like drops of glass The hiefer licks in grass and dew That makes her drink and fodder too The little bird his morn song gives His breast wet with the dripping leaves Then stops abruptly just to fly And catch the wakened butterfly That goes to sleep behind the flowers Or backs of leaves from dews and showers The yellowhammer haply blest Sits by the dyke upon her nest The long grass hides her from the day The water keeps the boys away The morning sun is round and red As crimson curtains round a bed The dew drops hang on barley horns As beads the necklace thread adorns The dew drops hang wheat ears upon Like golden drops against the sun Hedge-sparrows in the bush cry ‘tweet’ O'er nests larks winnow in the wheat 'Till the sun turns gold and gets more high And paths are clean, and grass gets dry And longest shadows pass away And brightness is the blaze of day. FLOWERS 1 The flowers are silent in their bloom Without a sorrow or a tomb Enjoying homes by all so dear The summer months of every year 2 Winds are its suitors, and they play Music all the summer day Round its beauty and its breath That never hears the voice of death 3 They are the pearls of earth and air And meet with friendship every where The scripture truths of every soil Field flowers that neither spin nor toil 4 The flower is silent in its bloom Without a sorrow or a tomb Enjoying sunshine, winds and showers Silence is the life of flowers DEW 1 The tears of dew night leaves Upon the grass at morn Shews nature inly gri[e]ves For deeds that day has done For beetles trod upon Moths and butterflies destroyed Nests with the young ones gone Left desolate and void 2 For some the boys will get And some the hawk destroys Nature will mourn them yet For spoiling summers joys Hawks steal young birds by day And the owlet hawks by night So nature mourns her griefs away In dewy pearls so bright 3 Her tears of dew night leaves On flower and grassy blade At the havoc day has made Dews fall at evening's gray How heavy the gale sighed When the birds were stole away Loud chirping ere they died SONG [Smile kindly love when we shall meet] 1 Smile kindly love when we shall meet Think kind too when we part For these love are the bitter sweet That warm or chill the heart A doubtful word, an awkward look Interpreted unkind Is printed in loves motley book Which years will keep in mind 2 Let our first meeting love be smiles That spring itself puts on For nothing more the heart beguiles For absent shadows gone Thy first words be they sweet &amp;

SONG [The wing of the blackbird is the hue of her hair] 1 The wing of the blackbird is the hue of her hair The hue of the rose is the face of my fair And yet she's a romekin, slomekin thing And as wild as a filly let loose in the spring She'll jump o'er the anthills as quick as a bee And shout to the birds on their nests in the tree She's a good-for-nothing romikin slomekin thing Yet as sweet as a queen by the side of a King 2 She's healthy and wealthy, and wild as a bird And startles with fear if a bramble be stirred When far from her home she will run like the roe And thinks rudeness watching where e'er she may go But she has good excuses for being so wild She's a woman in size, while she's only a child She pictures in fancy, what innocence means And sports like a baby not yet in her teens 3 O girlhood has joys what her mother would fain Recall to herself if they would come back again And so would we all, but one's youth is the time For health, love and innocence just's in their prime A child so loves nature she does not mean sin Only see what a rolicking humour she's in She's a young sweet and good-for-naught, rolicking thing Yet as fair as a queen by the side of a King BALLAD [I lie me down, and then I think] 1 I lie me down, and then I think I try to sleep an hour away And fancy I'm on some broad brink In foreign lands so far away I think of one for loves dear sake With her neat dress and bonnet on The very moral in her make Is bonny Mary Hamilton. 2 I sit upon the road-side hill Church folks are going by to prayer Of goodly ways there comes no Ill And all have sabath faces there I looked at one, my face grew pale My self possession all was gone I turned around to view the vale And sighed for Mary Hamilton. 3 I feared offence, and dare not speak I praised the flowers—and meant hersel The sweet-briar bloom excuse did make The heath-bloom tinkled like a bell The briar blushed warm and so did she I wondered what she thought upon But from that hour I longed to see The blooming Mary Hamilton. 4 Her hands were white, her feet were small Her neck the creamy cloud at e'en I thought when she was gone away What could those turning blushes mean Her features were the pastoral bloom I told her 'twas the very same Like evenings blue her two eyes shone And all her face was in a flame Thus I loved Mary Hamilton. 5 We staid, the sun sank in the sea, And saw the pale moon climb the sky; And dear as one's own life to me Was Mary's parting smile and sigh; I left her with a warm embrace, And talked of time 'till time was gone, And told her at that very place I'd next meet Mary Hamilton. 6 The rising moon looked on the stream, New gilding all the sleepy flowers; The dew fell on the heather bloom, And made the most delightful hours; The fern owl churred his evening call, The chaffer made his evening song— And dew had sprinkled drops o'er all When I left Mary Hamilton. THE ORPHAN CHILD 1 The sun, the shower, the clouds, the air, Seem sweet unto the Orphan Child As to the rich mans heir. Poor lonely thing the blossoms wild, Its little dirty fingers pull With self delight, 'though none is nigh To praise and cherish what it shews To strangers passing by 2 Yet its young heart and its dull eye That meets no kindred's kindly smile Can look upon the sunny sky And please itself the while And chase the butterflies, and bees,— And pull the blossoms wild, For rich man's boys are pleased with these So is the Orphan Child. 3 The daiseys in springs sunny hour It pulls upon the trodden green For gardens, or a garden flower Its eyes have never seen It calls the daiseys all its own Before the workhouse door And goes and plants them where they've grown In places on the moor— 4 It is a thing of silent joys A thing of silent fears It weeps to hear that moaning noise When its sisters grief it hears It shares the blessings of the sky Some pleasures of the spring When merry bee and butterfly Will please that lonely thing. THE INVITATION 1 Let us go in the fields love and see the green tree Let's go in the meadows and hear the wild bee There's plenty of pleasure for you love and me In the mirth and the music of nature We can stand in the path love and hear the birds sing And see the woodpigeon snap loud on the wing While you stand beside me a beautiful thing Health and beauty in every feature. 2 We can stand by the brig-foot and see the bright things On the sun shining water, that merrily springs Like sparkles of fire in their mazes and rings While the insects are glancing and twitters You see naught in shape but hear a deep song That lasts through the sunshine the whole summer long That pierces the ear as the heat gathers strong And the lake like a burning fire glitters. 3 We can stand in the field love and gaze o'er the corn See the lark from her wing shake the dews of the morn Through the dew beaded woodbine the gale is just born And there we can wander my dearie We can walk by the wood where the rabbits pop in Where the bushes are few, and the hedge gapped and thin There's a wild-rosy bower and a place to rest in So we can walk in and rest when we're weary. 4 The skylark my love from the barley is singing The hare from her seat of wet clover is springing The crow to its nest on the tall elm swinging Bears a mouthful of worms for its young We'll down the green meadow, and up the lone glen And down the woodside far away from all men And there we'll talk over our love tales again Where last year the nightingale sung. STANZAS [I had a dream,—I thought I spoke] 1 I had a dream,—I thought I spoke, And still it was a dream;— Another voice the silence broke, That did so truly seem. I thought of one in thoughts delight, Nor wished the thought away; Yet still came on the sleepless night, And still the weary day But sweet that voice hung on my ear, Like sounds unearthly,—everywhere 2 It was a voice!—it seemed a dream,— A waking dream of sleep; It haunted me, and still I seem That waking voice to keep, For there was one I valued more Than all I'd ever seen; I wished to keep as heretofore, And be as I had been. 'Twas heard around—beneath—above,— I wakened, and the voice was Love! SONG [There's pleasure in all the sun shines on] 1 There's pleasure in all the sun shines on, The earth, and the ocean that foams; The cottage it looks so divine on, And the homestead, that dearest of homes. 2 Those sheds that stand under the mountain, Those one-story huts by the wood; With two windows that look to the fountain, Where each shed seems a boat in the flood. 3 The flower borders under the window, Looking just as if floating away; And the old chimney, black as a cinder, Where the swallow makes dwellings of clay. 4 There's pleasure in all the sun shines on, The earth and the ocean that foams; The cottage, it looks so divine on, And the homestead, that dearest of homes. SONNET The Nightingale This is the month, the Nightingale, clod-brown, Is heard among the woodland shady boughs; This is the time when, in the vale, grass-grown The maiden hears at eve, her lovers vows. What time the blue mist, round her patient cows, Dim rises from the grass, and half conceals Their dappled hides,—I hear the Nightingale, That from the little blackthorn spinny steals, To the old hazel hedge that skirts the vale, And still unseen, sings sweet:—the ploughman feels The thrilling music, as he goes along, And imitates and listens,—while the fields Lose all their paths in dusk, to lead him wrong Still sings the Nightingale her sweet melodious song. June 12./44. THE VIOLET 1 I will not throw away the flower, The little violet blue; I pluck'd it in a lonely hour, When she I loved was true. 2 Beside a hedge upon a hill, All by itself it grew, A type of her who loves me still, In scent and colour true. 3 I'll keep the blossom many hours, Until it withered be; A type of sweet and withered flowers, But most of love, and thee. A REGRET I've none to love and none to fear And none to meet at gloaming For I'm a woe worn prisoner here No more with freedom roaming Shut up from friends and all beside With none to sit beside me How gloomy now the moments glide Where sore oppressions hide me LOVE 1 Love is life's spring,—the summer of the soul,— The Eden of earth's happiness,—the spring Of all on earth that's lovely!—no control Can hinder its conception:—'tis the wing That bears the turtle to its nest in spring;— It is the mainspring that conducts the whole,— The eternal anthem which all nature sings, And woman is of man the life and soul, As long as earth exists or planets roll!— 2 Love is an April sky of various shades,— To day all sunshine, and all showers tomorrow; Buds early blighted,—blossoms born to fade, And woman stamp'd with the pale hues of sorrow. Care keeps her cash book where none like to borrow; Tears are as lonely as the lonely dove; Procrastinated falshood is hell's horror,— Hope is its fire that kindles from above,— Hate burns hell-deep in chronicles of love!— 3 Yet such is love, and of the purest water,— The secret essence of the living clay, That feeds upon itself, and wrongs no daughter Of Eve; but glides on in its own pure way, Living as in its own light:—the diamond's ray Has no reflection upon meaner things; Impurity takes all its hues away, While purity its grand impression brings.— Love is the jewel in the crown of Kings. STANZAS [Would'st thou but know where Nature clings] 1 Would'st thou but know where Nature clings, That cannot pass away! Stand not to look on human things, For they shall all decay:— False hearts shall change and rot to dust, While truth exerts her powers; Love lives with Nature, not with lust; Go, find her in the flowers! 2 Dost dream o'er faces once so fair, Unwilling to forget? Seek Nature in the fields, and there The first love face is met. The native gales are lovers' voices, As nature's self can prove; The wild field flowers are lovers choices, And Nature's self is Love. TO M??? C???? 1 The Spring is coming round the skirted wild-wood With many signs of flowers you loved in childhood; When buttercups and daiseys, past all counting, Covered the green, a gold and silver fountain. 2 The wood anemone we used to gather, The violets looking for the spring's warm weather, The pilewort on the banks, the flocks of daisies, And all the small spring flowers in sunny places. 3 And now we'll gather past years in our fancies, And take from childhood's book, Spring's sweet romances; We'll trace again cow-commons and the wildwood, Where we were wont to gather flowers in our childhood. 4 We'll go where violets grow among the bushes, And when thy hand's full tie them up with rushes; We'll trace cow pastures overrun with daisies, And gather water-blobs in marshy places. 5 And in the meadow where the willow boughs dip, We'll go and gather up the sunny cowslip; And when we've gleaned cow commons field and wild wood, We'll think ourselves as happy as in childhood. SONG [Mary, I love to sing] 1 Mary, I love to sing About the flowers of Spring, For they resemble thee. In the earliest of the year Thy beauties will appear, And youthful modesty. 2 Here's the Daisy's silver rim, With gold eye never dim, Spring's earliest flowers so fair; Here's the pilewort's golden rays, Set the cow-green in a blaze, Like the sunshine in thy hair. 3 Here's forget-me-not so blue, Is there any flower so true? Can it speak thy happy lot? When we courted in disguise, This flower I used to prize, For it said “Forget-me-not!” 4 Speedwell! and when we meet In the meadow paths so sweet, When the flowers I gave to thee, All grew beneath the sun May thy gentle heart be won And I be blesst with thee!— May 13/44 SPRING 1 How beautiful is Spring! the sun gleams gold, Reflecting like a mirror, burnished ever; The skylark from the eddings near the fold, Mounts up and sings!—bright gleams the flowing river Full to the brim!—Winter is gone! and never Attempts his scattered force to bring Against such burnished scenes;—the true believer Sees flowers in bloom and hears the woodlands ring, With joys awake:—how beautiful is Spring!— 2 Poesy of seasons! scripture of the year! Whose buds put forth in promise to the sun, And at their resurrection shall appear Hued in all colours, as from rainbows won,— Gold, blue, green, red, and white! the meadows run, A garden world of bloom, and richly fling Incense to every wind, and shower, and sun; Music unceasing, woods and valleys bring From birds about their nests! how beautiful is Spring! 3 The daisy's golden eye and silver rim Crowd every pasture like a fall of snow And pilewort, where earth's diadems grow dim, Stud emerald grass with gold where'er they grow Spring flowers flood earth in showers to overflow;— Meadow and close and pingle, where suns cling, And shine on earliest flowers,—there they shew Their rainbow maps of loveliness; and bring Their painted crowds,—so beautiful is Spring! 4 Anemonies and lilies of the valley Cover whole acres of the forest glade; And blue-bells, that in woods and spinneys dally, Beneath the oak tree and the hazel's shade. The bushiest place is like a carpet made; No copse so thick, but there their blooms they bring,— No spot so cold but meets their purple shade; In every place where feathered warblers sing, Wild flowers in armies come!—so beautiful is Spring. 5 The garish Summer comes with many tribes Of gay and gaudy flowers, in bright array; But the hot sun the cloudy morning bribes, And dries all moisture with his scorching ray;— Corn-poppies oft a scarlet host display,— The oak woods green, like rocky masses hing On wooded hills,—the willows waving grey, Hang mournful in the stream;—birds cease to sing:— The sweetest poesy of the year is Spring!— SONG [Maiden dearest, leave a smile!] 1 Maiden dearest, leave a smile! It will bless in rest and toil; Leave a smile before we part, Bring back welcome to my heart; Leave a smile to be my rest, And let me know I'm blest. 2 My life and soul I love the[e] well,— Words may speak, but cannot tell,— Language has not power to be What thy smiles would speak to me Leave a smile to be my rest, And let me know I'm blest. 3 Maiden dearest! many a year, I've loved thee silent and in fear, Seen thee in many a grove and vale, And heard thy voice upon the gale. Maiden with a smile approve, And bless my love! A LAMENT FOR JERUSALEM 1 Mockery sits on Salem's throne, And ruin lives upon her walls; Her Holy City lies alone, A ruined glory none recalls. Oh! where's the glory and the gem Of Sion's hill,—Jerusalem?— 2 Siloa is the place of tombs, The most entire of all around, There the King-poet's memory blooms,— Patriarchs and prophets rotting round!— But Sion's hill hath lost its gem,— Oh! where art thou! Jerusalem!— 3 Judah's fair maid's no coronet! The queen of Judah has no throne, Dead ruins every where are met,— The Holy City lies alone! Queens sleep without their diadem Dews are the city's weeping gem! 4 The grass grows on the mountain heath, The holy ruins lie below; The Jews are scattered, like the breath Of tempests centuries ago, Oh! where's the glory and the gem Of Sion's hill, Jerusalem? 5 Mockery sits on Salem's throne, And ruin lives upon her walls, Her holy city lies alone, A ruined glory none recalls! Gone is the glory and the gem Of Sion's hill, Jerusalem!— LINES Written on a very boisterous day in May, 1844 'Tis May, and yet the skies are overcast With clouds resembling a rough storm at sea;— 'Tis May,—and yet the hurricane goes past, In dust, like foaming billows o'er the lea, High over head close by me,—and 'tis He Who wakes the sea, and drives the ships away From anchor, into wrecks! Here I am free From danger,—and the fields and woods the bay To rest my weary limbs amid the storms of May. BALLAD [We'll walk among the tedded hay] 1 We'll walk among the tedded hay, That smel[l]s as sweet as flowers; While the meadow water winds its way Beneath the hawthorn bowers. 2 And when the bright green haycocks throw Their shadows from the sun, When thou art weary there we'll go, And rest, the heat to shun. 3 We'll to the hawthorn shades retire, Where blooms the wild dog rose; And smell the sweetly scented briar, Where the shining river flows. 4 We'll talk o'er joys we once could prove, And blithely spend the day, For those pleasant dreams of early youth Can never pass away. June 18/44. THE HOUR OF PRAYER 1 Ave Maria! woman mild,— Mother ever young and fair, Hushing slumbers to her child,— It is the hour of Prayer! 2 When children bend the artless knee, And mothers kneel beside 'em there, Maiden mild my guardian be, In eve's still hour of Prayer! 3 A light in darkness, be thou still, Let love's affections be thy care; Thou beacon light of good and ill, Attend the hour of Prayer! 4 The darkness comes, the dews descend;— Thou woman ever mild and fair! Be to the friendless still a friend, In the silent hour of Prayer! 5 'Tis come!—the o'erpowering heat of day Seeks night, its peace to share; Sweet maiden teach us how to pray In silent hours of Prayer! MORNING 1 The corn is in the ear, And the prime is on the year And blossoms every where, Sweet scent the early morning: The summer is in flower, And the soft refreshing shower Scents the breezes every hour, But most at early morning. 2 The brook runs down the dale, And the cuckoo tells her tale, And the happy nightingale Sings the song of early morning; On the bank the hawthorn green, Hides the linnet's nest unseen, While sweet the blossom'd bean Perfumes the early morning. 3 The maiden seeks her cow, And the ploughman holds his plough, And from the woods dark brow Sweet comes the sounds of morning; On the powdered woodland oaks, The glossy raven croaks, And the lonely wo[o]dman's strokes, Sound loud at early morning. 4 The corn is in the ear, And 'tis summer every where, The prime of all the year, That scents the early morning; The water clear and blue, With its lilies shining through, And the long grass gem'd with dew Proclaim the summer morning. A GLOOMY DAY IN SUMMER A dull gloom hangs above the peaceful fields, And in the moody mist the houses sleep, Still as if tenantless!—the vapour shields The heavens like a secret, that would keep The doom sealed over our dull hours of sleep. The evening comes as something not forgiven; The clouds hang lowly but forbear to weep;— Noontide and evening weigh the balance even, And gloom shuts Hopes eyes from the sight of Heaven! SPRING 1 And is Spring come again to cheer, The withered winter of the year?— The grass to feed the hungry kine,— The flowers to please those eyes of thine? 2 The daisey tempts the playful lamb, To crop its silver bloom; The golden pilewort tempts the child, For many a flower to come. 3 The tree's first foliage tells the child The sweet approach of Spring: The white-thorn leaves of tender green, Where linnets build and sing. 4 The rose,—there is a rose of May, Though not the sweetest rose; But Spring will have the sweetest day, And the fairest flower that blows. 5 What is it?—search the fields, and find,— No garden owns the flower;— It is the blossom of the mind! The joy of every hour. 6 The birds are preachers!—bush and tree Are pulpits all around,— Where shining flowers and droning bee, As listeners gather round. 7 The vine trees open into leaf, How beautiful they are! How lovely doth each tendril curl, Like some Greek maiden's hair. 8 The fountain from its bed of sand, Boils up and curls away; It runs, and so it will run on, Through summers lasting day. 9 The footpath winding all the way, We trace it near a mile, Through closes green, and fallows grey, O'er many a gate and stile. 10 Grass on each side, and wild field flowers, And children running on, Crop many a one and think them fair, Till half the day is gone. 11 There's many a butterfly to chase, With meal upon its wing; Till summer comes and spoils the sport With children and the Spring! DEATH'S MEMORIES 1 Death's memories are graves, Nor can they pass away; Nature, in every hillock, saves A green plot o'er decay; And daisies like to clumps of snow, Go each spring season there to blow. 2 Death's memories are graves,— The all that Nature granted,— Where the tall mallow waves, And the small flower blooms, self planted, Where Mother's sleep and babes lie still, And sunshine rests upon the hill. 3 Death's memories on tombs, Keep fragments of decay, Like wrecks of lumber rooms, Which Time throws out o' the way If common weeds were not to come, The graves would lie without a bloom! EVENING 1 It is the silent hour when they who roam, Seek shelter, on the earth, or ocean's breast; It is the hour when travel finds a home, On deserts, or within the cot to rest. It is the hour when joy and grief are blest, And Nature finds repose where'er she roves; It is the hour that lovers like the best, When in the twilight shades, or darker groves, The maiden wanders with the swain she loves. 2 The balmy hour when fond hearts fondly meet; The hour when dew like welcome rest descends On wild-flowers, shedding forth their odours sweet; The hour when sleep lays foes as quiet friends;— The hour when labour's toilworn journey ends, And seeks the cot for sweet repose till morn;— The hour when prayer from all to God ascends;— At twilight's hour love's softest sighs are born, When lovers linger neath the flowering thorn. 3 Oh! at this hour I love to be abroad, Gazing upon the moonlit scene around ‘Looking through Nature up to Nature's God’ Regarding all with reverence profound! The wild flowers studding every inch of ground, And trees, with dews bespangled, looking bright As burnished silver;—while the entrancing sound Of melody, from the sweet bird of night, Fills my whole soul with rapture and delight. [Left in the world alone] 1 Left in the world alone Where nothing seems my own And everything is weariness to me 'Tis a life without an end 'Tis a world without a friend And everything is sorrowful I see 2 There's the crow upon the stack And other birds all black While november's frowning wearily And the black-clouds dropping rain 'Till the floods hide half the plain And everything is weariness to me 3 The sun shines wan and pale Chill blows the northern gale And odd leaves shake and shiver on the tree While I am left alone Chilled as a mossy stone And all the world is frowning over me MARCH NOSEGAY 1 The bonny march morning is beaming, In strange and crimson grey; White clouds are streaking and creaming, In the sky till the noon of the day: The fir dale looks darker and greener And the grass hills below look the same The air all about is serener And the birds less familliar and tame. 2 Here's two or three flowers for my fair one Wood-primroses, and celandine too I oft look about for a rare one To put in a poesy for you The birds look so cleanly and neatly Though there's not a leaf on the grove The sun shines about me so sweetly I cannot help thinking of love. 3 So where the blue violets are peeping By the warm sunny side of the woods And the primrose 'neath early morn weeping Amid a large cluster of buds The morning it was such a rare one So dewy so sunny and fair I sought the wild flowers for my fair one To wreath[e] in her black glossy hair. VERSES TO M.A.B???? 1 By the wood-hedge primroses are peeping By the thorn root white violets are sleeping 'Neath the tears of the morning all smiling and weeping On March's latest mornings 2 The primrose peeps aneath the thorn By woodland hedges newly born Its sulphur bosom in the morn Scented with dews so early 3 The violets too bloomed by the hedge Peeping in clumps by withered sedge Of spring the sweet and early pledge Sweet scenting early morning 4 By hazle stumps and mosses green Where the little brook is seen And thou and I at spring have been Walking at early morning 5 The lark is cheeping to the sky A march days stormy melody Till clouds conseal it from the eye In the wild and early morning 6 The crow is on the furrowed field The blackbirds in the spinney shield And in the new laid hedges build Singing at early morning 7 The hanging mists the blebs of dew That turns the pasture grass to blue As if the heaven was looking through To meet the early morning 8 In such a place—and can love sever We've met and could have talked for ever The meadows and that winding river Beheld our early mornings 9 And thou a lovely maiden fair As sweet as any flower there Went forth to take the cooler air All in the early morning 10 Young buds now wait thy leisure hours To pluck the sweetest new born flowers When spring revives the woodland bowers As on this early morning STANZAS [The spring is come forth, but no spring is for me] 1 The spring is come forth, but no spring is for me, Like the spring of my boyhood, on woodland and lea, When flowers brought me heaven, and knew me again In the joy of their blooming o'er mountain and plain My thoughts are confined, and imprisoned—O when Will freedom find me my own vallies again? 2 The wind breath[e]s so sweet, and the day is so calm; In the woods and the thicket the flowers look so warm, And the grass is so green, so delicious and sweet, O when shall my manhood my youth's vallies meet, The scenes where my children are laughing at Play, The scenes where my memory is fading away. 3 The primrose looks happy in every field In strange woods the violets their odours will yield And flowers in the sunshine all brightly arrayed, Will bloom just as fresh and as sweet in the shade: But the wild flowers that bring me most joy &amp; content Are the blossoms that blow where my childhood was spent. 4 Then I played like a flower in the shade and the sun And slept as in Eden when daylight was done There I lived with my parents, and felt my heart free, And love—that was yet joy or sorrow to be, Joy and sorrow it has been, like sunshine and showers And their sun is still bright o'er my happiest hours. 5 The trees they are naked, the bushes are bare And the fields they are brown, as if winter lay there; But the violets are there by the dykes and the dell, Where I played ‘hen and chickens’—and heard the church bell Which called me to prayer-book and sermons in vain O when shall I see my own vallies again?— 6 The churches look bright as sun at noon day, There meadows look green e're the winter's away, There the pooty still lies for the school boy to find And a thought often brings these sweet places to mind Where the trees waved like thunder no music so well Then nought sounded harsh but the school-calling bell. 7 There are spots where I played, there are spots where I loved, There are scenes where the tales of my choice were approved As green as at first—and their memory will be The dearest of lifes recollections to me!— The objects seen there in the care of my heart Are as fair as at first—and will never depart. 8 Though no names are mentioned to sanction my themes Their heart's beat with mine and make real my dreams: Their memories with mine their diurnal course run, True as night to the stars, and as day to the sun. And as they are now so their memories will be 'Long as sense, truth, and reason, remaineth with me. ‘I AM’ 1 I am—yet what I am, none cares or knows; My friends forsake me like a memory lost:— I am the self-consumer of my woes;— They rise and vanish in oblivion's host, Like shadows in love's frenzied stifled throes:— And yet I am, and live—like vapours tost 2 Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,— Into the living sea of waking dreams, Where there is neither sense of life or joys, But the vast shipwreck of my lifes esteems; Even the dearest, that I love the best Are strange—nay, rather stranger than the rest. 3 I long for scenes, where man hath never trod A place where woman never smiled or wept There to abide with my Creator, God; And sleep as I in childhood, sweetly slept, Untroubling, and untroubled where I lie, The grass below—above the vaulted sky. SONNET ‘I am’ I feel I am;—I only know I am, And plod upon the earth, as dull and void: Earth's prison chilled my body with its dram Of dullness, and my soaring thoughts destroyed, I fled to solitudes from passions dream, But strife persued—I only know, I am, I was a being created in the race Of men disdaining bounds of place and time:— A spirit that could travel o'er the space Of earth and heaven,—like a thought sublime, Tracing creation, like my maker, free,— A soul unshackled—like eternity, Spurning earth's vain and soul debasing thrall But now I only know I am,—that's all. SONG [True love lives in absence] 1 True love lives in absence, Like angels we meet her Dear as dreams of our childhood Aye, dearer and sweeter. 2 The words we remember By absence unbroken Are sweeter and dearer Than when they were spoken. 3 There's a charm in the eye There's a smile on the face Time, distance, or trouble Can never deface. 4 The pleasures of childhood Were angels above And the hopes of my manhood All centred in love. 5 The scenes where we met Aye the joys of our childhood There's nothing so sweet As those fields of the wild-wood. 6 Where we met in the morning The noon and the gloaming And stayed till the moon High in heaven was roaming. 7 Friends meet and are happy, So are hopes fixed above; But there's nothing so dear As first meetings of love. SLEEP OF SPRING O for that sweet untroubled rest That Poets oft have sung The babe upon its Mothers breast The bird upon its young The heart asleep without a pain When shall I know that sleep again When shall I be as I have been Upon my Mothers breast Sweet nature's garb of verdant green To woo my former rest Lone in the meadow field &amp; plain &amp; in my native wilds again The sheep within the fallow field The bird upon the green The Larks that in the thistle's shield &amp; pipe from morn to e'en O for the pasture fields &amp; fen When shall I see such rest agen I love the weeds along the fen More sweet then garden flowers Freedom haunts the humble glen That blest my happiest hours Here prisons injure health &amp; me I love sweet freedom &amp; the free The crows upon the swelling hills The cows upon the lea Sheep feeding by the pasture rills Are ever dear to me Because sweet freedom is their mate While I am lone &amp; desolate I loved the winds when I was young When life was dear to me I loved the song which nature sung Endearing Liberty I loved the wood the dale the stream For then my boyhood used to dream Then toil itself was even play 'Twas pleasure e'en to weep Twas joy to think of dreams by day The beautifull of sleep When shall I see the wood &amp; plain &amp; dream those happy dreams again [The bee loves a blossom and I love a woman] 1 The bee loves a blossom and I love a woman The bird loves the valley, and I love the glen Where flowers of all sorts, with her beauty is blooming Oh! when shall I see womans beauty again When the evening is near, o when shall I hear The voice of my true love adown in the glen 2 The bird loves the bushes among the green fields The flowers love the meadow and bloom in the sun And I love the cottage that sanctions, and shields The love of the woman my early days won O when shall I see, her smiles dear to me And see my fond children play in the sweet glen 3 The bee courts the blossom the whole summer day When the blossoms bend down, and smiles up again Oh when shall I fly from lifes follies away And live there with true love adown in the glen To share in her joys, and life's leisure employ Along with my true love adown in the glen HOPE OF HOME 1 'Tis not gone for ever, The light of the soul; It flows like the river, When it meets with controul!— It rolls like the ocean, Over mountain and glen, Till past the commotion, And the sun smiles again. The valleys may tremble, The mountains may move, But I can't dissemble,— In the soul of true love. 2 There's the children to love, And the woman to cherish; Though the mountain may move:— And the mortal may perish! Yet the soul never dies; Over valley and glen, And the sun in the skies, Shall shine bright again.— Shine brightly and bless All that life can approve, The child to carress And the woman to love. 3 For woman we cherish Our cares to the last In their love truth will flourish Till danger is past Is fear round us gloaming Does terror dismay The woman dear woman Exales it away The soul ever lives O 'tis not gone for ever For the light woman gives Is the sun to set never. VALENTINE [The Spring's coming on, my dear] 1 The Spring's coming on, my dear; The sun gets warm and high, The winter storms are gone, my dear: And brighter grows the sky. Here's pansies for thy love my dear,— How bright they smile and shine!— Will you[r] love be what they appear, My heart-ease Valentine? 2 For love is like the flowers of Spring, Born for an Aprils day:— The lusty suns that summers bring, Burn all their blooms away. Here's snow-drops for thy dark brown hair; They are—though cold they shine,— What woman should be, pure and fair, Just like my Valentine. LINES, TO MARY 1 The brook goes winding like a snake Through many crooks and turns Loud are the gugles which it makes Like music—and then mourns The thorn leans o'er its mimic waves That o'er the pebbles run The mimic foam in dark place raves Then crimples in the sun. 2 Will Mary teach me how to love Or nature how to woo The brook[s] below the clouds above Each others track pursue Do breezes speak fond womans name Are portrates seen in flowers Of those we love yet dare not claim In springs delightful hours. 3 Yes in this brook I sit beside Her voice like music dwells The flower her presence shews with pride And loves true story tells The very birds within the hedge Love's happy thoughts proclaim All heard or seen in springs first pledge Seem speaking Mary's name. March/44. VALENTINE [The morning is up betimes my dear] 1 The morning is up betimes my dear Each postman is loaded by Cupid The letters are nothing but lovers and rhymes Some loving or joking or stupid 'Tis an old fashioned thing to go church to be wed And then nothing can alter the fassion But to day like the birds many lovers are led More warmly revealing their passion. 2 Thy love at the first gave such witching delight No maiden on earth could be neater And absence has kept thee so long from my sight That thy beauty shines sweeter and sweeter The flowers of summer are showy and fine But the blossoms of spring are the dearest And just so it is with my fair Valentine The best are the sweet and the sincerest. 3 There's the Cyclamin flower of a delicate hue There's the snowdrop so drooping of delicate white There's the violet and crocus all over dark blue That makes in a nosegay a valentine quite I'll wed thee and love thee, and this is the day We must call those we love Valentine And I hope when we see the sweet blossoms of May Thou'lt be a sweet blossom of mine. SONG [Love lives beyond] Love lives beyond The tomb—the earth—which fades like dew I love the fond The faithfull &amp; the true Love lives in sleep The happiness of healthy dreams Eve's dews may weep But love delightfull seems Tis seen in flowers &amp; in the evens pearly dew On earths green hours &amp; in the heavens eternal blue Tis heard in spring When light &amp; sunbeams warm &amp; kind On angels wing Bring love &amp; music to the mind &amp; where is voice So young &amp; beautifully sweet As natures choice When spring &amp; lovers meet Love lives beyond The tomb the earth the flowers &amp; dew I love the fond The faithfull young &amp; true SONG [When in summer thou walkest] When in summer thou walkest In the meads by the river &amp; to thyself talkest Dost thou think of me ever A lost &amp; a lorn one That adores thee &amp; loves thee &amp; when happy morn's gone &amp; natures calm moves thee Leaving thee to thy sleep like an angel at rest Does the man who adored thee still live in thy breast Does nature e'er give thee Loves past happy visions &amp; wrap thee &amp; leave thee In fancys elesian[s] Thy beauty I clung too As leaves to the tree When thou fair &amp; young too Looked lightly on me Till love came upon thee like suns to the west &amp; shed its perfuming &amp; bloom on my breast Flower of summers bright beaming Thou star of the even Thy grey eyes are beaming Like light of the heaven When shall I talk to thee In eves dusky glooming When shall I walk with thee In summer flowers blooming before &amp; love thee as much as I loved thee &amp; be teazed with the sighs of loves abscence no more THE VOICES OF SPRING 1 There's the voices of Spring Can we know them again The lark's on the wing And the bee's on the plain The same sort of voices around and below As we heard in the meadows ago. 2 There's a chirp in the hedge Where the primroses grow There's a song in the sedge Where the grasshoppers go The hedge sparrow there has her dwelling begun And the spider is spinning his home in the sun. 3 There's a hum in the air Theres a song in the rain All these features so rare Shall we know them again The pilewort and daisy are on the green bank;— Hid by the dead grass tuft's all withered and rank. 4 These are those lost voices That love cherished so Those sweetest of choices Ten summer's ago On the ear of my fancy they come in the spring In the songs of the birds, and the brooks when they sing. 5 Loves favours I see them In springs early flowers These were my day dreams then In summers green hours And in fancy those faces they seem now to glow With the same lovely features, as ten summers ago. SONNET [Bushes and trees the spirits of nature haunt ye and are glad] Bushes and trees the spirits of nature haunt ye and are glad To be in your still freshness and green shades A dewy happiness that is never sad Wispers among the leaves of your sweet glades Like the sweet happy loves of tittering maids Happy retreats and oceans of green leaves Where sweet retirement bosoms in your shades A still sweet calm of happiness and rest How sweet the boughs through one another weaves While the hedgesparrow cleans his brown hued breast And thrushes hid in such a crowd of leaves Which makes us start as from a fancied snake So much its breast the startled lie deceives And sweeter still when winds and branches shake SONG [My home is thine and where thou art] 1 My home is thine and where thou art My fancies daily fly My love is in thy beating heart No other home have I The spring and summer bloom of thee And what thou art they are Thy bonny breast my home shall be And I thy love will share 2 Is there a thought to doat upon A joy uncrossed with cares That thought to Hellen's breast is gone That joy her bosom wears Does summer show a lovely rose The flower is Hellen's face Is Edens garden where it grows Then Hellen owns the place 3 Is there a happiness on earth It lives near true-loves dwelling Is there a joy of purest birth 'Tis in the breast of Hellen Where Hellen is her home is mine Without her, lonely is the dwelling Spring cannot bloom nor summer shine Without the love of Hellen SONG [Come beautiful maiden while autumn delays] 1 Come beautiful maiden while autumn delays And the sunsets so sweet in the gold tinted west While the fading beach tree sets the woods in a blaze And the lark sings his song e're he sinks into rest In Autumns gone by how fondly I press't thee And loved thee sincerely, and so I do now As I wandered along with thee ever near me While the leaves they were fading on every bough 2 The sky rolls away with its ocean of clouds The earth seems as ocean, as billows the grove Woods roar like the sea or the ships flapping shrouds But earth has warm places for beings that love By the hedges my sweet one we'll wander unseen Where the leaves of all colours are leaving the trees Where the rush beds all ripple like water so green And not a wild flower is in bloom on the lea's— 3 Yet love is as warm as the sun in the sky And the winds they breath[e] music though ever so loud The lark pipes its song in the fleecy clouds high And the crow o'er the ploughed fields walks lonely and proud— Then come my dear maiden enjoy the sweet morning Down the walk in the meadows we'll wander away There the bramble hedge hangs o'er the path like an awning And the hedge sparrow hides at the bottom all day 4 Come in the fields then my first loved Mary Come while the harp of the woods is in tune Here neath the knotty old oak we will tarry While the sun press the hedges as warm as in June Though time passes on thy name is a pleasure So come my sweet Mary we'll wander alone And I'll tell thee the trials I've suffered, My treasure Yet forget every one if you'll call me your own— TO MISS W? Theres beauty in the intercourse of nature with her kind Then come my dear Miss W? and hear the sueing wind That will not let thy hair alone, for all its glossy curls But blows it in disorder like a string of broken pearls That winnows round thy snowy neck to cool the summer heat I wish I was the wind myself that kisses one so sweet 2 The steppings stones are o'er the brook, that makes such croaking groans So lightly step Miss W? nor fear the cockling stones The wheat-field shields the patridge's nest that craiks at early morn The path's not wide enough for two, so follow through the corn Or walk before Miss W? dear with step so light and free Thy figure and thy flowing hair are beautiful to me 3 The heath is full of yellow furze, and beautiful they shine And loved one it is passing sweet to feel thy arm in mine The wind is shaking every bough, and beautiful it sings This walk with thee is sweeter far among these lovely things The knapweed flowers, and heather bells the ruddy and the blue And all around speaks happiness so beautiful and true— 4 My sweetest love, loves sweetest love the corn waves in the gale And flowers so rich on every step make beautiful the vale The birds are chirping in the bush, the lark springs from the corn I've never spent a sweeter hour with thee since love was born The rabbits dance upon the hills, and lick their velvet foot Then hop away among the brakes, or hide them in the rut— 5 The hawk hangs still upon the air, a speck in yonder cloud And in the old grown hedges there the wood dove cooes aloud, On the dwarf broom the butterfly, just like a flower alive Basks in the sun, while toiling bees haste to and from the hive The heath vetch clings around to every bush and tree As my love dear Miss W? clings fondly unto thee— SONG [The sun was shining o'er the hill] 1 The sun was shining o'er the hill The church spire peeped above the trees And merry went the sparkling rill And happy sung the morning bees When Jockey he a courting went To Mary Johnson young and fair The dew hung on the bowing bent And crowds of cowslips nodded there When Jockey he a courting went To Mary Johnson young and fair 2 In each new place were Mary went There ne'er was seen the like before Each lusty clown his money spent And set the tavern in a roar Her shape and make, and handsome face Won welcome looks from every eye The shepherd sighed and left his place The ploughman looked his head awry Each tongue spoke of her bonny face And Mary Johnson's all the cry 3 Her lips as red as coral were The very hue of Jockeys seal Her cheeks, first roses of the year Would soften bosoms hard as steel The very toast of all the town The ballad of the noisy fair All sung her praises up and down And Mary walked the stranger there As handsome as a rose just blown Was Mary Johnson young and fair 4 Her bosom white as is the dove Her eyes were black as is the sloe And she was Jockey's choisest love And Jockey was her only beau To day the bells rung might and main And rung a peal till eventide They made the valleys ring again Till many a cloud looked petrified For Jockey was the happy swain And Mary Johnson was the bride MARY 1 Alas there's no retreating From the brightness of thy eyes My heart with love is beating Then do'nt my love despise O slight not sweetest Mary The love I bear to thee Nor look at all contrary To the claims of destiny 2 O let me be the nearest To your bosom, and your love I bring a love sincerest What nature must approve Where tears and sighs are pleaders I own I've none to give With such sad interceeders My wishes cannot live 3 A honest heart that lieth not That tells its story true A written plea without a blot Is what I offer you Should thy love live without a stain In constancy divine Then heaven Mary glows again And mine my love is thine DRINKING SONG 1 Come along my good fellow Let's sit and get mellow For sorrow we hav'nt got leisure We've money and time And that's just the prime To enjoy it in comfort &amp; pleasure Call for ale or else wine On roast beef we can dine And joy we shall have without measure 2 The parson may preach Against ale, and beseach His church folks to head no such liquor But in neat sanded rooms With young girls in their blooms Pray who'd ever think of the vicar Then leave that dull dunce Let's have sandwich for lunch And pull at the tankard or pitcher— 3 Let the dull parson think Was he here but to drink He would say beer was made for to please us When man is a dry A good sermon's my eye The vicar his task is to teaze us Tankards foam o'er the rim Where the fly loves to swim And that is the lecture to please us 4 So come my old fellow Let's go and get mellow For care brings no hour of leisure We've money and time And just now in prime To sit down enjoying our pleasure 'Tis summer's prime hours And the room smel[l]s of flowers Now boys is the season for leisure STANZAS [The passing of a dream] 1 The passing of a dream Are the thoughts I have to day Cloud shadows they all seem And pass as soon away Their meaning and their shade I cannot well define The little left unsaid Seems others, and not mine 2 Here's a place so dainty dress't That o'er my vision swim Like a land in the far west But alas my vision's dim The trees are not the trees Under which I used to play And the flowers they cannot please For I am sad to day 3 Here's the shumac all on fire Like hot coals amid the green It might please my heart's desire If elsewhere the place had been Here dreams their troubles make To a body without pain When shall my mind awake In its own loved scenes again MARY AYRE 1 The music of thy voice is steeling Around the heart in fondest feeling And leaves a passion past consealing For bonny Mary Ayre 2 The breeze is flapping in the shrowd The storm is singing in the cloud And still the first in every crowd Is bonny Mary Ayre 3 The flood and forrest doubly raves A mist is hanging o'er the waves And flowers are in a thousand graves With floods and tempests o'er them 4 In every season of the year Her voice in music songs I hear In mountains, valleys, every where I hear sweet Mary Ayre 5 There is a soul in natures voice That makes my lonely heart rejoice The breezes wisper my first choice And that is Mary Ayre THE WIND &amp; TREES 1 I love the song of tree and wind How beautiful they sing The licken on the beach tree rind E'en beats the flowers of spring 2 From the southwest sugh sugh it comes Then whizes round in pleasant hums It sings the spirit of the storm The trees with dancing waxes warm 3 They dance and bow, and dance again The very trunks, each branch and grain Shake and dance and wave and bow In every form no matter how 4 In every storm they dance on high The semblance of a stormy sky Then sob and roar and bend and swee The semblance of a stormy sea 5 I love the song of wood and wind The sobs before its roar behind I love the stir of flood and tree 'Tis all of natures melody 6 I love the roaring of the wind The calm that follows cheers the mind 'Tis like the good mans end of peace When joys begin and troubles cease SONG [There was the thorn and the stile it hung over] 1 There was the thorn and the stile it hung over And the neat little pasture all covered with sheep There the woodbines I often had pulled for my lover While the little bird started up out of its sleep I wandered for weeks in that sweetest of season And saw bush and hedge all covered with may But to say they could please me was slighting of reason When the charm that delighted me bloomed far away 2 There she would come like the charm of the summer In a sweet modest dress, like the queen of the may And ne'er from her tongue did I e're hear a murmur Till that bitter hour we were parted away— I have saught such a place since I left it, and often Would stand by the hawthorn that grew by a stile But nothing my first formed decision could soften T'was there Mary met me to chatter and smile 3 I went there again, aye in just such a season And still the old hawthorn hung over the stile But the charm it was gone, could I fancy the reason Though the sun it shone bright on may blossoms the while The knoll where we sat full of wild flowers was blooming Yet nothing could please me in that happy dell The silence told plainly no maiden was comeing In her absence all pleasure had bid it farewell SCOTLAND [Auld Scotland's woods

sweeter land can be SOME DAYS BEFORE THE SPRING 1 There's a gladness of heart in the first days of Spring There's a pleasure in memory to hear the birds sing The Pink or Hedgesparrow will sing at day break Though a leaf on the hedges is hardly awake As for flowers on the grass there's not one to be seen And the grass in the fields scarce enough to be green The ruts full of water all muddy and thick Which the boy tries to stop with a bit of a stick 2 The bits of brown haystacks all cut to the core In the grassy close corners show winter is o'er With the oaks frowning o'er them all mossy and grey They will stand in the shelter 'till they cut the new hay The field-fare is there a seeking hedge fruits And the crow on the grass, is boreing for roots With the jackdaw that nauntles among the molehills In their grey powdered wigs, and bright yellow bills 3 The stones in the brooks, are all covered with green All trailing and spreading as mosses are seen In the woods at the spring and the close of the year When violets and primroses like sisters appear How level the meadow, how saffron the sun How fine is the web that the spider has spun Round the twigs of the hedge and the bents of the vales In the soft mornings sunshine and sweet evening gales 4 Then come let us walk and enjoy the brisk air And fancy the change when sweet spring it is there Wild flowers in the grass, and nests in the tree A hedge for the bird and a flower for the bee So away let us walk while the sun's in the sky And the paths o'er the greensward and rushes are dry And Mary will see what there is to be seen The hedges swelled buds, and the meadows more green TO MARY ANN B???? 1 Along the pleasant banks of Nene Arise my love and walk with me And we'll enjoy the morning scene Where all is beautiful like

The mist is gone and every tree In mornings light is plainly seen Sweet is the breath of morning jaunts While bright dew lies on every place The bee is on its wild flower haunts The rose is in thy bonny face 3 The east is hung with golden gems In crimson red and saphire blue In gold and crystal fringed hems The spiders lace is hung with dew On each thorn branch and flowery stem As if to decorate the place For health and nature dwells with them And shows its bloom upon thy face 4 Then walk with me sweet Mary Ann And in the meadows meet the morn Where nature lives as it began And all her joys are newly born Then Mary come and make more dear The scene—and Eden it will be When every gale thy voice will hear And every vale be full of thee SPRING VIOLETS Sweet Maiden of the early

thee Then leave these young shoots with their tendrels curl'd For the oaks that are mossy and hoary Art weary with beating the flood Here's a mossy bank—come and sit down 'Twas nature that planted this wood Unknown to the sins of the town Full of pride and contention come hither We'll talk of our troubles together 5 The world is all tost in commotion The blind lead the blind into strife Come

Upon the evening tree Will Jane now seek the heather dells And crop the flower with me Its blush is on her lovely cheek Its gold eye on her breast 'Tis eaten in an apple streak And on loves bosom press't— 3 It buds among the briars in May And opens in the June Will Jane now go the wild wood way And meet the silver moon Say will you go the wild wood way At evenings dewy close And talk a pleasant hour away And love the wild-hedge-rose MOON LIGHT WALK 1 The sun like the last look of love Has smiled farewell on the tower and tree And in the shades of every grove Has left the calm that pleases me While all around so pure does seem I fancy that my God is near Or think I live in some sweet dream Where evenings moon is shining clear 2 Now evenings dews are falling down And moon beams on the gravel stoop So bright they shine o'er darkness thrown They seem as you could pick them up And fir dale shadows in a group Darker than darklike coffined palls You'r naturally obliged to stoop To feel where seems no ground at all 3 How sweet the bum clocks bagpipe drone That buzzes by with evening song He meets the traveller all alone On furze clad heath and spinney strong Now that the busy daylight talk Has ceased, and left this scene alone I'll wander down the moon lit walk And call its pleasures all my own THE BLACKBIRD 1 The blackbird is a bonny bird That singeth in the wood His song is in the evening heard When the red cow chews her cud His song is heard in morning loud Upon the bright white thorn While the blythe milkmaid sings as proud And holds the world in scorn 2 O bonny is the blackbird still On top of yon fir tree On which he wipes his golden bill And blithely whistles he He sings upon the sapling oak In notes all rich and mellow Oft' have I quit towns noise, and folk In springs sweet summers weather 3 The blackbird is a bonny bird I love his mourning suit And song in the spring mornings heard As mellow as the flute How sweet his song in April showers Pipes from his golden bill As yellow as the kingcup flowers The sweetest ditty still SONG [Sweet is the light of thy bright eye] 1 Sweet is the light of thy bright eye A living sun a living joy Sweet is the smile of thy red cheek Like rose skies when spring mornings break Sweet are the swellings of thy breast Like lilies when the lakes at rest Thy figure, and thy dress so neat And every thing about thee sweet 2 Sweet are my daily dreams of thee And when I see the bush and tree And hear the little linnet's song I think of thee the whole day long They are what once thou loved to see When walking in the valley free They are what once did please thy ears In shadows of departed years 3 Thy face is sweet, thy cares are young Thy voice is womans lovely tongue Thy smiles are such as all delight Thy thoughts are lilys clothed in light Thy swan like neck, thy swelling breast Like lilies on the lake at rest Thou art of all the fairest flower That blooms amid this earthly bower HUNTING SONG 1 The woods are all colours and bright is the sun The scent will lie strong on the fallows at morn Hark-away to the field for the hunt has begun Do'nt you hear the whip crack and the sound of the horn The skies are ash coloured the fallows are brown The red coated hunters are galloping by And in the bleached woods at the end of the town Horses caper, and dogs make a terrible cry 2 Hark-away to the noise there is health in the sound The woods are as still as the ships in a bay You hear the shrill whine of the favourite hound That will track him, and harrass him all the long day Hark-away to the woods, hark-away do but look The fox has broke cover, and by the bent [spray] Drops his tail but a moment, to lap at the brook Then flies o'er the red russet fallows away 3 The woods as if painted in all colours shine In brown's red and yellows the finest of scenes The woods and the hedges look more than divine Like paintings hung out in the beautiful greens The cry of the hounds in the wild flurried sky The sun crackles sweet on the stubbles so gray 'Tis the birthday of nature the foxhunters joy So away to the fields, hark, forward, away— MY EARLY HOME WAS THIS 1 Here sparrows built upon the trees And stock-doves hide their nest The leaves where winnowed by the breeze Into a calmer rest The black-caps song was very sweet That used the rose to kiss It made the paradise complete My early home was this 2 The red breast from the sweet briar bush Drop't down to pick the worm On the horse chesnut sang the thrush O'er the home where I was born The dew morn like a shower of pearls Fell o'er this ‘bower of bliss’ And on the bench sat boys and girls —My early home was this 3 The old house stooped just like a cave Thatched o'er with mosses green Winter around the walls would rave But all was calm within The trees they were as green agen Where bees the flowers would kiss But flowers and trees seemed sweeter then —My early home was this— SONG Mary Appleby 1 I look upon the hedge row flower I gaze upon the hedge-row tree I walk alone the silent hour And think of Mary Appleby I see her in the brimming streams I see her in the blooming hour I hear her in the summer dreams Of singing bird, and blooming flower 2 For Mary is the dearest bird And Mary is the sweetest flower That in spring bush was ever heard That ever bloomed on bank or bower O bonny Mary Appleby The sun did never sweeter shine Than when in youth I courted thee And dreaming fancied you'd be mine 3 The lark above the meadow sings Wood pigeons coo in ivied trees The butterflies on painted wings Dance gaily with the meadow bees All nature is in happy mood The sueing breeze is blowing free And o'er the field and by the wood I think of Mary Appleby 4 O bonny Mary Appleby My once dear Mary Appleby A crown of gold thy own should be My handsome Mary Appleby Thy face is like the summer rose Its maiden bloom was all divine And more than all the world bestows I'd give had Mary e'er been mine [How beautiful ye breathe ye passing gales] 1 How beautiful ye breathe ye passing gales Around the scenes of morning in its rest The leavel meadows and the laughing vales And broader lake with sunbeams on its breast How beautiful ye glitter ye sunbeams Upon the meadow lake and glassy glade Where beautiful in all her youthful dreams I walked with thee my once loved maid. 2 As lovely as the early gems of spring The day-break and young flowers that grace the mead Then walked she out at morn a sweet young thing Fairest of the wild-flowers choisest breed That mantle every sod with gold and silver shene While skies with golden hue, or crimson shade Or rose, or purple overtops the green There in the morning wandered my sweet maid. 3 Ye springing gales how beautiful ye breath[e] Along the tethered grass or silver pool While sweet the ragged robbins wreath[e] A brade of wild flowers by the waters cool There wandered forth the maid with auburn hair O'er thy sweet mead in sunlight and in shade Pure as the wild flowers—as the summer fair. The once loved, blooming beauty, fair, young maid. HESPERUS 1 Hesperus the day is gone Soft falls the silent dew A tear is now on many a flower And heaven lives in you 2 Hesperus the evening mild Falls round us soft and sweet 'Tis like the breathings of a child When day and evening meet 3 Hesperus the closing flower Sleeps on the dewy ground While dews fall in a silent shower And heaven breathes around 4 Hesperus thy twinkling ray Beams in the blue of heaven And tells the traveller on his way That earth shall be forgiven [A rosey bud I would not kill] 1 A rosey bud I would not kill To spoil its rich perfume For the sweet flower can do no ill So let it longer bloom I would not hurt a thought of love For all the world contains Nor spoil the feather of the dove Or turn delight to pains 2 For nature is the only thing That we should ne'er destroy 'Tis gladsome as the skylarks wing That singeth hymns of joy Its first and earliest offspring love The tints of every rose Those flush tints kindled from above That with all nature grows 3 'Tis robbing life of one fond hour Some lonely thing of joy To stoop and pluck a lonely flower Or insect to destroy A rosey bud I would not kill To cheat the summer breath For trueloves errand they fulfill That never taste of death SONG [Smile again my lovely Lasses] 1 Smile again my lovely Lasses Lovely lasses smile again Loves joy all grief surpasses And care may sigh in vain There's the hill beside the barn There's the knoll upon the bank Where lovers true may meet and join Lovely lasses smile again 2 Pools they gather on the plain And tell of seasons dreary Lovely lasses smile again Then care will soon be weary Green hills may shine in white And clouds obscure the plain Home's fire side will then delight If lovely lasses smile again TO A LARK SINGING IN WINTER 1 Wing-winnowing lark with speckled breast Has just shot up from nightly rest To sing two minutes up the west Then drop again Heres some small straws about her nest All hid from men 2 Thou farmers minstrel ever cheery Though winters all about so dreary I dare say thou sat warm and erie Between the furrows And now thy song that flows unweary Scorns earthly sorrows 3 The little mouse comes out and nibbles The small weed in the ground of stubbles Where thou lark sat and slept from troubles Amid the storm The stubbles ic'el began to dribble In sunshine warm 4 Sweet minstrel of the farm and plough When ploughmans fingers gin to glow How beautiful and sweet art thou Above his head The stubble field is in a glow All else seems dead 5 All dead without the stubble ground Without a sight without a sound But music sunshines all around Beneath thy song Winter seems softened at thy sound Nor nips to wrong 6 On all the stubble-blades of grass The melted drops turn beads of glass Rime feathers upon all we pass Everywhere hings And brown and green all hues that was Feathered like wings 7 It is a morn of ragged rime The coldest blast of winter time Is warmth to this Siberian clime Dead winter sere And yet that clod brown bird sublime Sings loud and clear 8 The red round sun looks like a cheat He only shines blood freezing heat And yet this merry birds night seat Seems warm's a sty The stubble woods around it meet And keep it dry 9 Each stubble stalk a jiant tree Scarce higher than [an infant's] knee Seem woods to stop the winds so blea From this snug home Boundless this stubble wood must be 10 How safe must be this birds sweet bed In stubble fields with storms o'er head Or skies like bluest curtains spread Lying so lone With bit of thurrow o'er her head Mayhap a stone 11 The god of nature guides her well To choose best dwellings for her sell And in the spring her nest will tell Her choice at least For God loves little larks as well As man or beast 12 Thou little bird thou bonny charm Of every field and every farm In every season cold and warm Thou sing'st thy song I wish thy russet self no harm Nor any wrong 13 Free from the snares thy nature shuns And nets and baits and pointed guns Dangers thy timid nature shuns May thou go free Sweet bird as summer onward runs I'll list' to thee 14 I'd writ one verse, and half another When thou dropt down and joined a brother And o'er the stubble swopt together To play 'till dark Then in thy night nest shun cold weather As snug's a Lark 15 Old russet fern I wish thee well Till next years spring comes by itsel Then build thy nest and hide it well 'Tween rig or thurrow No doubt may be this is the dell —Spring comes the morrow 16 Then blossomed beans will bloom above thee And bumble bee buz in and love thee And nothing from thy nest shall moove thee When may shines warm And thy first minstrel[sy] above thee Sing o'er the farm SONG [The moon above the hills is peeping] 1 The moon above the hills is peeping The stars are in the purple skies While lilies on the lake are sleeping But not so dear as Nelly's eyes I love the evening on the mountain The tickling dripples from the spring The sky's reflection in the fountain But Nelly seems a dearer thing She's lovely as her sister graces For evening walks in sweetest places 2 How beautiful the moon is shining How silver bright the stars appear The clouds lie round like silver lining The sweetest time in all the year The sweetest time for Nelly's rambles Is sure the shut of silent eve The heath is overhung with brambles That often catch at Nelly's sleeve Come Nelly while the light remains And let us ramble down the lanes 3 Where bloom the Canterbury bells And where the foxglove flower reposes Where the chaffinch sleeps in lonely dells In the dog-briar bushes hung with roses. Come sweet Nelly charming creature Let thy evening walk be mine Womans charms in every feature Sweet as is the eglantine Let us walk the heath together In light of love, and summer weather SONG [Among the green bushes the songs of the thrushes] 1 Among the green bushes the songs of the thrushes Are answering each other in music and glee While the magpies and rooks in woods hedges—near brooks Mount their spring dwellings on every high tree There meet me at eve love we'll on grassy banks lean love And crop a white branch from the scented may tree Where the silver brook wimples and thy rosy cheek dimples Sweet will the eve of that courting hour be— 2 We'll notice wild flowers love that grow by thorn bowers love Though sinful to crop them now beaded with dew The violet is thine love, the primrose is mine love To spring and each other, so blooming and true With dew drops all beaded, the feather grass seeded The cloud mountains turn to dark woods in the sky The daisey bud closes while sleep the hedge roses There's nothing seems waking but you love and I 3 Larks sleep in the rushes linets perch on the bushes While mag's on her nest with her tail peeping out The moon it reveals her though she thinks night conceals her Though bird nesting boys are not roving about The night winds wont wrong her, nor aught that belong her For night is the nurse of all nature in sleep. The moon love is keeping a watch o'er the sleeping And dews for real pleasures do nothing but weep 4 Among the green bushes we'll sit with the thrushes And blackbirds and linnets an hour or two long That are up at the dawning by times in the morning To cheery thy milking with music and song Then come at the eve love and where the banks lean love By the brook that flows on in its dribbles of song While the moon looks so pale love and the trees look so hale love I will tell the[e] a love tale an hour or two long— THE AIK 1 O there is one sweet dear thing In every bodys mind Sweet as life is to a king Sweet as kindred to its kind Some love the awthorn bush Some love the woodland brake —I loved the singing thrush And I lov'd the woodland aik 2 For the thrush it loo'd the aik And it built upo' the tap And ere morn was wide awake And every leaf did drap Wi' the bright and glassy dew While the thrush was on the aik Singing every morning new Pleased for its ain dear aik 3 O the mind has many things To worship and admire The hawk wi' winnowing wings And the gilt fanes twittering fire The aiks midsummer crown Mang aither green luiks mellow Theres some o' autumns brown And some o gouden yellow 4 Morn and noon and eve Bloom a' the aik thegether And spring and autumn weave Their several luiks o' weather Brown dark green and yellow And in its nest o' moss and clay Where the thrush sings with its fellow A' through the summers day [I lay me down with thoughts of thee] 1 I lay me down with thoughts of thee And dream of thee in sleep And when night dew hangs on the tree 'Tis beautiful to weep 'Tis beautiful to see thee pass In visions of the night With eyes as clear as liquid glass And features fair as light 2 'Tis beautiful to see thy form In the pupil of loves eye A womans shadow soft and warm Like an angel from the sky With locks of auburn hanging down Thy shoulders chaste and white Thus fleecy clouds as soft as down Hang round the moon at night 3 'Tis sweet to see thee vanish past In the dark and midnight eye I try to clasp the vision fast But faster it will fly— Thou art the soul of midnight thought The life of lonely dreams Each night thou'rt in my fancy sought Then beautiful all seems THE ROUND OAK 1 The Apple top't oak in the old narrow lane And the hedge row of bramble and thorn Will ne'er throw their green on my visions again As they did on that sweet dewy morn When I went for spring pooteys and birds nests to look Down the border of bushes ayont the fair spring I gathered the palm grass close to the brook And heard the sweet birds in thorn bushes sing 2 I gathered flat gravel stones up in the shallows To make ducks and drakes when I got to a pond The reed sparrows nest it was close to the sallows And the wrens in a thorn bush a little beyond And there did the stickleback shoot through the pebbles As the bow shoots the arrow quick darting unseen Till it came to the shallows where the water scarce drebbles Then back dart again to the spring head of green 3 The nest of the magpie in the low bush of white thorn And the carrion crows nest on the tree o'er the spring I saw it in march on many a cold morn When the arum it bloomed like a beautiful thing And the apple top't oak aye as round as a table That grew just above on the bank by the spring Where every saturday noon I was able To spend half a day and hear the birds sing 4 But now there's no holidays left to my choice That can bring time to sit in thy pleasures again Thy limpid brook flows and thy waters rejoice And I long for that tree—but my wishes are vain All that's left to me now I find in my dreams For fate in my fortune's left nothing the same Sweet Apple top't oak that grew by the stream I loved thy shade once—now I love but thy name June 19/46 THE MAID IN THE SPRING Sonnet The maidens light foot seems to pity the flowers She bruises with treading on in their blooming hours In her hurrying haste she oft goes to tie A broken cowslip stalk that the flower should not die With a blade of the grass that her feet must crush And for sake of the linets nest loves the green bush And talks to the leaves smiling green in her eye To hide the nest well till the young ones can fly And when speed is most urgent she'll deem it not vain To turn back and lift up the daisey again Though her mother was ill and the docter was sought Sick flowers must be minded to do as she ought The nightingales her's and all birds on the wing So the fond maiden sings to herself in the spring HOPE &amp; JOY Hopes have many autumns so have joys Small is the blast that fades them—less destroys The tender leaves bear not the slightest wrong Fading like first thoughts of young poets song As stars melt the darkness to purple or grey So hope melts the dread of our sorrows away As thunder storms loose their dread blackness when near So hope in our dangers will lessen their fear Daiseys shut up at even like hail when we pass But open by daylight bright stars in the grass So hope and joy bud[s] to spectators unknown Are insights to heaven when the flower is full blown Whether bred on the earth or sent down from above Hope and joy are but two other names for true love [My spirit lives in silent sighs] 1 My spirit lives in silent sighs And gazing upon thee I hear thy silence make replies To every thing but me I see thy silence talk to flowers The birds will sing to thee And lonely in these lonely hours You never talk to me 2 I never hear thy voice nor know Its sound in fancy's ear A silent shade where'ere I go In beauty hovers near Do wild flowers love; I think they do And often stooping down I hear them talk to shower and dew On many a lovely mound 3 I often see thy fairy form In springs bee singing hours Light stepping on in fancy warm As love among the flowers Just as the breeze in sunshines pass So maids in summer hours So rove as not to harm the grass Nor tread upon the flowers THE LONELY FLOWER 1 O bonny is the lonesome flower That blossoms in the lonely glen Self sharing dew and sun and shower And blooming from the eyes of men 2 And bonnily awoke the morn Upon its undefiled bloom The sweetest flower that ere was born Is hidden in the vales of broom 3 Its leaves are wet with drops of dew And so's the woodlarks spotted breast Brushing them off from where she flew The cowslip close beside her nest 4 Its root increased from year to year Its peeps they blossomed all the may The school-boy knew not where to spier The milkmaid passed it every day 5 O bonny is the lonesome flower That blossoms in the lonely glen Shares by itself the sun and shower And blossoms from the eyes of men SONG [Is may to bloom without thee] 1 Is may to bloom without thee My beautiful Hellen And spring spread green about thee And come not near thy dwelling If thou art absent Hellen The spring is abscent too The birds no tales are telling The morning brings no dew 2 The white-thorn bloom is swelling The white flower peeping through I thought of absent Hellen And keen the winter blew Free as the air I ranged With Hellen cheerful hearted But o how nature changed When Hellen she departed 3 The grass and thorn turned black Flowers frost nipt in the blast As spring would ne'er come back And the summer time was past When spring flowers tales are telling And birds begin to sing I still expected Hellen Would blossom with the spring Feby 4th/47 SONG [The kingcups shew their golden looks] 1 The kingcups shew their golden looks Flowers bloom before they wither So come my love we'll stride the brooks And climb the hill together I love thee for thy happy face Thy links of dark brown hair I love thee for thy shape and face Thy eyes so bright and fair 2 Sweet Hellen I love thee well Thou first sweet flower of spring The ash tree bark thy name shall tell Where I thy beauties sing Where on the early leafing thorn The speckled thrushes sing And primrose neath the hazels born Show the first loves of spring— 3 The spring is of thee—and the birds That in the woods rejoice Thy beauties sing in better words And emulate thy voice The bushes in the green so warm That loves the suns controul Shews nature in its happiest charm Where woman is the soul— 4 O Ellen my earthly love With angel face and eye I see thee in the stars above And varigated sky— Thy happy cheeks of rosey glow Thy eyes so bright and fair Thy womans beauty here below Reflects an angel there— THE CAMP 1 Will you come to the camp in the pale moonlight Where stars are the watchmen each sweet summers night Will you come to the camp when the stars shine bright In the pale moonlight 2 Will you come to the camp ere the moon goes down Where the song shall be sung o'er the ale so brown Will you come to the camp not a mile from the town Ere the moon goes down 3 The joys of the camp are not cares of the crown There'll be fiddling and dancing a mile from the town Will you come to the camp ere the moon goes down A mile from the town 4 The camp of the gipseys is sweet by moon light In the furze and the hawthorn—and all out of sight There'll be fiddling, and dancing and singing to night In the pale moon light TO A STRANGER 1 The visions of love are as true as the season As true as the flower to the bosom of spring Sweet stranger I saw thee—thy look was so pleasing Love touched on the chord of its slenderest string I saw thee and loved thee, and fail to compare thee To any thing else half so lovely as thou The bird in its music has nothing to spare thee And thou'rt fairer than blossoms that hang on the bough. 2 Thy looks were so blooming, thy smile so endearing My glad heart was happy to gaze on thy face The sweetest of flowers in the summer appearing Was nought to compare when you bloomed in their place Thy cheek sweetest health in her pride did adorn it 'Twas simple and lovely as woman could be The roses of summer had spread their leaves o'er it And made it the bloom of no being but thee. 3 Thy looks were so win[n]ing thy face so unseeming I never was charmed so by any before The sweetest the rose is at mornings begining But thou art far dearer full fifty times o'er Sweet stranger I've seen thee, and love and admire thee I know not thy name, on a stranger I gaze As a stranger I dare not think love may inspire thee 'Tho I sing in a ballad of love in thy praise. TWILIGHT 1 Sweet twilight, nurse of dews And mother of sweet hours With thee a walk I choose Among the hawthorn bowers That overhang the molehil greenly gray Made as it were to intercept the way 2 Beetles are thy trumpeters And to thy silence play Where the soft still rustle stirs O'er dead winds of the day Mid marshy sedge dull aspens and pasture rushes O'er green corn fields and hedge row bushes 3 Thy hours have one light place Streaky and dunly grey As if the night was giving place And bringing back the day The sun seems coming so the eye beleives But darkness deepens round and undeceives 4 O'er brooks the weeping ash Hangs cool and grimly dark I hear the water splash And then half fearing mark In ivy'd ash a robber near the stream 'Till from a nearer view I find it but a dream 5 Sweet twilight nurse of night Thy path the milk maid treads With nimble step so light Scarce bends the cowslips heads But hastening on ere by thy light forsook She leaves her cows all resting by the brook 6 Sweet twilight thy cool dews Are beautifully spread Where the nightingale its song renews Close by the old cow shed In that low hazel oft' I've heard her sing While sombre evening came on downy wing 7 The playful rabit too Its white scut glancing Amid the silver dew I've seen them oft advancing In troops from spiney's where they love to dwell Dancing on molehills in the open dell 8 Spring leaves seem old in green And the dull thorn is lost in the[e]— Dun twilight—but the hazel still is seen In sleeping beauty by the old oak tree Giving the woods a beauty and a power While earth seems Eden in such an hour 9 Sweet twilight in thy dews And silence I rejoice Thy odd stars bid me muse And give to silence voice Now twilight ceases on the verge of even’ And darkness like a pawl spreads over heaven THE SIMPLE FLOWER 1 I ever loved the simple flower Where woman cast her eye There's not a bloom in walk or bower Like that she wandered by 'Twas faith without a tear or sigh It drank dews from above 'Twas joy and hope and poesy —It won a womans love 2 I lov'd the flower she gazed upon And stooped to gaze again It seemed the sweetest in the sun The fairest on the plain I loved sweet woman in that hour The sun smiled sweet above And when she looked upon that flower The flower itself was Love AN ACROSTIC On the Revd Wm Todman Yardley Hastings Right is the man who builds his hopes on high Eternal language written in the sky Verse there is melody outpeering time Diurnal tongues of stars and suns sublime Wisdom is written there without disguise Mind in that shining volume never dies To day, tomorrow still remain the same On the eternal record they proclaim Death there is no inhabitant—they shine Mid centuries past—and still appear divine Another world in every star appears 'Neath the blue concave of the rolling spheres Young worlds, and newer systems reappear Another and another year by year Revolving in immensity of space Designed for heaven and the human race Light there is endless—the eternal spheres Envelope destinies unknown to years Youth is their atmosphere—life never dies Hours are as centuries in those happy skies All there is timeless, endless, spaceless all Stations for angels free from human thrall To day—tomorrow never shadows there In climes celestial lives no shades of care Nought mortal lives—all that was dust is gone God is their sovereign and the only one. SONG [Ive been roaming in the gloaming] 1 Ive been roaming in the gloaming, Where the mist fell o'er the braes; I had na' thoughts o' sweethearts coming, As the rain would spoil her claes; The cobweb lace upon the fern Bedeck'd wi' dew on every space The very like that Mary had When she was in her last years place 2 The burnie trotting down the brae A market pace is hardly seen The river rolling far away A race horse speed in silver sheene And will the bonny Mary come And will the bonny Mary dare To face the mist and face the gloom The evening walk with me to share 3 We'll wander o'er the ling clad brae, We'll wander by the mountain side And meet joy where the burnie strae's Gif' Mary'll be my bonny bride The mist scarce sprinkles in my face The evening now is calm and fair The old thorn is our trysting place And I'll meet bonny Mary there THE FALSE ONE 1 O dinna paint her looks to me I canna bear to hear it The last war faus, as faus can be And now I dinna fear it The last war faus to me laddie As thine war faus to thee I want na' more to grie' laddie Sae let the hizze be. 2 When e'er they tauk'd o' what she war She tossed her head so high And to mak the matter waur laddie She turn'd her nose awry— When she war proved a whare laddie She drop't her head fu' low And I knew more than they could tell So I let the hizzey gae. 3 I guess'd it lang, and thought it lang Till a' the guess went by The poet danged her in a sang And still she wa' fu' high But sin' I faund the hizzey's ways She dinna luik at me As red as madder in the braes She burned my face to see. SONG [Maiden unknown let me worship before thee] 1 Maiden unknown let me worship before thee Thou queen of my heart Let me bow and adore thee Thou spirit of beauty Thou vision of woman Let it still be my duty To worship thee blooming 2 For love is the sunshine And woman's the flower Cold cold is the moon shine And dewy the hour The moonlight has shame on't We can't sit to rest But the day has no blame on't That Mary likes best 3 Come come in thy beauty A woman in soul A daughter in duty Nor feelings controul Leave nothing to hinder The truth which I sing Nor let surly winter Take place of the spring [Adelaide, Adelaide why art thou sleeping] 1 Adelaide, Adelaide why art thou sleeping The sun's oe'r the hill and the dew's on the bushes The rose on thy cheek with blushes will deepen And loud is the singing of blackbirds and thrushes Adelaide why art thou sleeping O'er the river the willow is weeping Then wake from thy slumbers, rise with the sun For morning, and music, and joy is begun 2 In the thornbush, the thrushes are singing On the river the morehens are swim[m]ing From the village church music is ringing And no clouds are the morning beams dimming Adelaide Adelaide rise love For bright are the fields and the skies love Green looks the cornfields, and clear the brooks run The Glory and prime of the morning's begun 3 Can Adelaide fair, young, and blooming Let the sunrise tell dews of the morning That her summer of beauty is coming And not wake to see the adorning Come wake from thy s[l]umber Here's charms without number Woods, vale and mountain—the sunshine and shade All wait with new beauties for fair Adelaide [I've been gathering] 1 I've been gathering The springs happy weather in Wild meadow flowers While fell the spring showers; And every drop reminds me Of the days I left behind me Of one I loved well, and the sweet places too But these are loves secrets I must not tell you 2 In the meadows both talking In the meadows both walking The sun all about us Spring lived not without us THE INVITATION 1 The morning tide is sweet and fair The birds chirp loud in white thorn bushes Sweet maiden let us take the air Where runlets dribble through the rushes 2 I'll gaze upon thy happy face Thy comely shape thy eye shall charm As in the early spring we trace The healthy breath of field and farm 3 There is music without ere a bird There is bloom without ere a flower For eolean winds we oft' have heard And the grass blooms fresher every hour 4 The very rushes seem as flowers That nod above the marshy grass Through which the winds in summer hours Whistle and winnow as they pass 5 The lark may leave the new ploughed land And settle in another place Yet poets see and understand Sweet music in its russet face 6 And if we earnest look we see The daisey bud in April hours And all the buds in spring agree That hopes are sweeter far than flowers THE OLD YEAR 1 The Old Year's gone away To nothingness and night We cannot find him all the day Nor hear him in the night He left no footstep mark or place In either shade or sun Tho' last year he'd a neighbours face In this he's known by none 2 All nothing every where Mists we on mornings see They have more substance when they're here And more of form than he He was a friend by every fire In every cot and hall A guest to every hearts desire And now he's nought at all 3 Old papers thrown away Or garments cast aside E'en the talk of yesterday Are things identified But time once torn away No voices can recall The eve of new years day Left the old one lost to all Jany 1st/45 SONG [I fly from all I prize the most] 1 I fly from all I prize the most I shun what I loved best to see My joy seems gone—my peace seems lost And all I loved is hate to me I shun green fields and hate the light The glorious sun the peaceful moon More welcome is the darkest night Then glaring daylight comes to[o] soon 2 'Tis not the kiss that pouts to leave The lips of woman that we love 'Tis not the world—that will deceive Or any doubt of that above 'Tis something that my heart hath been 'Tis something that my heart approvd 'Tis something that my eyes have seen And felt they loved— 3 I grieve not those I loved are gone That happy years have pass'd away That time to day keeps stealing on To that ye call eternity I grieve not that the seasons fade That winter chills the summer dew While mortal things are heavenly made And all now doubt will soon be true 4 To thee my love, and only thee The spring and summer seemeth true Thy looks are like the flowers I see Thy eyes like air-bells filled with dew Thy look is that of happiest love And playful as the summer sea Thy health is from the skies above And heaven itself is full of thee— SONG—THE ECCHO The caulderwood ecchoes are loud in their glee Sounds—music repeatin' throug bushes &amp;

grove We may seek for true love Search earth sea &amp; sky 'Twill never come nigh For it dwells in the heart of a woman THE GREEN LANE 1 I met thee on the sabath eve All in the sunday dew When sunshine o'er the hill took leave Dip dipping out of view And there we stroll'd for many hours And said we'd meet again But I can't forget the leaves and flowers And the Old green lane 2 The spreading oak at the lane end Was ne'er so green and bright Nor the thorn so sweet in that lone glen As they were that sunday night The sun it set and lowly drop't Yet gold clouds did remain And though the singing birds are stop't I love the Old green lane 3 The beaten path went winding on The bushes look'd so green The leveret it went scouting on And nothing else was seen Till I met with her I went to meet I wish 'twas here again For memory can't forget as yet That Old green lane 4 And what she wore, and what she were I need not tell to you I often heard the evening char And saw the blebs of dew Her smile the sweetest e're was seen When shall I see't again A sweeter treat I've never seen Than her in the green lane 5 The breeze it wispered here she comes I look'd and there she sat The partrich creak'd its evening songs And whirr'd the merry chat But what she said, or what I did Must not be told again They're secrets now for ever hid Told in the Old green Lane [O'er Scotland's vales and mountains high] 1 O'er Scotland's vales and mountains high I've tented sheep and herded kye Where every bush and every tree Was health and happiness to me The mountain rills ran to the sea A sunday song of harmony And every day on hills and dales 'Twas harmony in all her vales 2 The sea-waves, and the ocean spray The river shining far away The cataract bursting o'er the rock In silver foam with thunder shock Where Scotlands scenes and Scotlands pride And in my boyhood deified I lov'd them all and every fame That wore the tartan of its name 3 I love her rivers and her floods Her mountains valleys, and her woods I love her heaths of goss and heather Her mountains mists and cloudy weather The spreading hills all dark wi' kye The muircocks where they wirring fly Scotland I love thy every scene Thy Bannockburn and Bonny Jean LARKS AND SPRING The sunny end of March is nigh And not a cloud is in the sky Along the footpath o'er the farm The school-boy basket on his arm Seeks the birds nest therein to look He takes a stone to cross the brook Made wider by the rainy night And hums the music of delight To see the rabits seek their burrow Or ground lark from the fallow'd furrow Start up and shiver while he sings Then drop as though he'd lost his wings As stunt and heavy as a stone In the brown furrow still and lone And still I love the ground-larks flight Starting up the ploughmans height And more and more unseal his eye When rose leaves pave the eastern sky To see the skylark as he springs Shake mornings moisture from his wings And rise and sing in music proud Small as a bee beneath a cloud 'Till mixing with the vapours dun He's lost in valleys of the sun And singing on in springs delight Some moments e're he comes in sight It drops, and drops from breezy morn To seek its mate amid the corn A happy song the skylark brings And spring's in every note he sings With coppled crown, and speckled breast The pilewort blooms above his nest In rain it seeks the sheltering furrow But sings when sunshine comes tomorrow In every field they mount and sing The songs of Nature and of Spring. EARLY MORNING 1 The day it was dawning so soon in the morning When o'er the green meadow I wandered along The birds were all silent in the mornings grey twilight And nothing was heard but the grasshoppers song 2 Like the wind through a cloister the breeze blew its moisture In blushes of mist as I wandered along And the dew drops looked through on the beautiful blue Of the cranesbill that grew in the meadow so strong 3 The skylark and linet rose up in a minute As soon as I moved mid the green waving bushes And morning skip'd by me, both far off and nigh me While the air on my cheeks came in beautiful gushes 4 The mist of the morning the meadows adorning All verged the orison in purple and grey And where the sun rises, his crimson surprises Is waking from rest to emblazon the day 5 As I was returning, that midsummer morning Along the green meadow so blooming and gay I met a sweet maid there, with rose cheek and arms bare And bid her good morning so soon in the day 6 Her voice was all melody, like leaves on a holiday Her blush was as sweet as the rose is in may Her eyes were as bright as, the dews of that night was When I met her that morning so soon in the day 7 The dews where she treaded their silver light sheded And flew from her foot steps in showers of pearl The grass brushed her light shoe so black and so bright to[o] And sweet was the smile of this beautiful girl 8 I kissed her so fearful, but she looked so cheerful All fear of her anger soon vanished away I left her all smiling the Summer beguiling And promised to meet her the next happy day— [There is a charm in nature felt and seen] 1 There is a charm in nature felt and seen In every season of the varied year In winters frost in springs reviving green 'Tis every where 2 In foreign lands how beautiful the sight Over a thousand mountains of snow sprey With nought of green—but mountains pale as light And all the way 3 The springs green herbage full of flowers And fields where lives the lark mid greener grain We love and worship them in April hours Then wish again 4 That spring with all her joys would longer last But summer with young buds is left to cho[o]se And brings once more in memory of the past Flowers of all hues 5 Then autumn red and yellow quickly pass Like broods of nestling birds upon the wing Till all is gone and nothing but the grass Remembers spring 6 The wind the shower, the drapery of the sky When day cools over meadows into dun And clouds in gold and crimson glories lie In set of sun 7 A globe of fire and as a table round Then wastes to half still shutting out the day Till the curved rim drops quickly in the ground And all is gray SONG [Soft falls the sweet evening] 1 Soft falls the sweet evening Bright shines the one star The night clouds they're leaning On mountains afar The moon in dim brightness The fern in its lightness Tinge the valley with whiteness Both near and afar 2 O soft falls the evening Around those sweet glens The hill's shadows leaning Half over the glen There meet me my deary I'm lonely and weary And nothing can cheer me So meet me agen 3 The gate it clap'd slightly The noise it was small The footstep fell lightly And she pass'd the stone wall And is it my deary I'm no longer weary But happy and cheery For in thee I meet all SONG [My mamme des not ken] 1 My mamme des not ken And my daddie must not know Where I meet wi' a young man Be't hail rain or snow I stoll across the hame clos And met him in the byre And my new gown I'll darn it For it caught agen the briar 2 I show my face the looking glass And steal my bonnet on And when I see theres time to pass Through the back door I'm gone I gae back way to shun the street That ne'er an eye may see And Rabbie at the byre I meet That came to meet wi' me 3 I cropt a win upo' the know When Rabbie he was bye It war' to me a gladsome show And scent o' nought but joy Rab said it stank about the fold And that I need not take And here it is at three moons old I keep it for his sake 4 A' summer lang I could na' tire In ganging to the fauld The sweet-briar bush agen the byre Smelt sweet through heat and cold But mammie does not ken And daddie must not know That Jennie's fond of a young man And meets where rushes grow SONG [There's suns in the dew blebs] 1 There's suns in the dew blebs Like diamonds they shine There's beads on the cobwebs And the thorn is divine With the dews o' the e'ening And gems o' the morning The ilka leafs leaning Wi' natures adorning 2 The muircock is whirrin The patrich is scraitchin The bum-clock is burrin And the wild deer is reaching The moss by the burn side Then hieing away When near him the churn cried And the mist curdled grey 3 But where is my charmer And where can she be The sun glowing warmer Sheds gold on the tree The mist canna' reach her A' gold in the lea Could nature but teach her She'd wander wi' me 4 I wait in the waukin Where nobody sees Where the trees they are talking To the songs of the bees When day gins to wander There will many eye see And talk over slander O Lucy and me THE AUTUMN WIND 1 The Autumn wind on suthering wings Plays round the oak-tree strong And through the hawthorn hedges sings The years departing song There's every leaf upon the whirl Ten thousand times an hour The grassy meadows crisp and curl With here and there a flower There's nothing in the world I find That pleases like the Autumn wind 2 The chaffinch flies from out the bushes The bluecap ‘tee hees’ on the tree The wind sues on in merry gushes His murmuring autumns minstrelsy The robin sings his autumn song Upon the crabtree overhead The clouds like smoak slow sail along Leaves rustle like the human tread There's nothing suits my musing mind So pleasant as the Autumn wind 3 How many miles it suthers on And stays to dally with the leaves And when the first broad blast is gone A stronger gust the foliage heaves The poplar tree it turns to gray As leaves lift up their underside The birch it dances all the day To rippling billows petrified There's nothing calms the quiet mind So welcome as the Autumn wind 4 Sweet twittering o'er the meadow grass Soft sueing o'er the fallow ground The lark starts up as on they pass With many a gush and moaning sound It fans the feathers of the bird And ruffs the robins ruddy breast As round the hovel end it whirled Then sobs and gallops o'er the west In solitude the musing mind Must ever love the Autumn wind Oct 15th/45 LOVE OF LIBERTY 1 Bless't is the man with mind erect— That seeks no rise that fears no fall For freedoms love shall him protect And having nothing leaves him all There liberty is ever free Knowing that such a love must be 2 'Tis Adam's love for Adam's kin That Eden of earths Liberty That triumphs over death and sin And will in natures love be free 'Twas so when this our world begun Love—bright and lasting as the sun 3 Free bonds that knit the son and sire The daughter and the mother too The links of heavens eternal fire Which death and hell can ne'er undo The love of Liberty is free Feeling that such a love must be 4 I bear my fate—but no misdeeds Has ever been my minds disgrace But like the corn above the weeds I make earths home my dwelling place Love Liberty and think I'm free For Freedom's love is all to me— Feby 14th/47 [Flowers shall hang upon the pawls] 1 Flowers shall hang upon the pawls Brighter than patterns upon shawls And blossoms shall be in the coffin lids Sadder than tears on greifs eyelids Garlands shall hide pale corp[s]es faces When beauty shall rot in charnel places Spring flowers shall come in dews of sorrow For the maiden goes down to her grave tomorrow 2 Last week she went walking and stepping along Gay as first flowers of spring or the tune of a song Her eye was as bright as the sun in its calm Her lips they were rubies her bosom was warm And white as the snowdrop that lies on her breast Now death like a dream is her bedfellow guest And white as the sheets—aye and paler than they Now her face in its beauty has perished to clay 3 Spring flowers they shall hang on her pawl More bright than the pattern that bloom'd on her shawl And blooms shall be strewn where the corp[s]es lies hid More sad than the tears upon griefs eyelid And ere the return of another sweet May Shall be rotting to dust in the coffined clay And the grave whereon the bright snowdrops grow Shall be the same soil as the beauty below Feby 11th/47 THE SHADY FOREST 1 'Tis beautiful sunshine and beautiful skies That please me the best whereso[e]ver I go In the sweet shaded forest 'tis there my heart lies Not needing a friend—or dreading a foe O the sweet shady forest how sweet the green seems So full of the summer and wild-flowers dreams 2 My heart has no malice for none of mankind My heart feels no envy wherever I go But I fly to green solitudes treat for my mind And the sweet shady forest my image will show There I'd live in its green, and in natures own plan And where nothing hurts nature I then feel I'm a man Feby 11th/47 THE THISTLE 1 I love the thistle with its ruddy flowers It cheers me on the waste in lonely hours It cheers me in lone sunshine out of doors When seeking solitude on rushy moores It cheers me resting on the way-side stones Where tears of morning glitter on the thorns I love the thistle 'tis an ill used flower And bees are singing round for many an hour 2 I love the thistle and its prickles too Cobwebs are round it with a veil of dew I love the thistle where it bravely stands For rights of Liberty in many lands Simply defying every rogueish eye With ‘wha dare meddle wi me’ that passes bye My right is simple, blooming 'mong the flowers That God's hand scatters on this land of ours 3 So I love the thistles spread round Scottish bowers Better than any other of the wildling flowers I love the warrior thistle where it stands Though often wounded in the legs and hands On Bannockburn its bloom undaunted stood Dy'd deeper in the streams of human blood Feby 13th/47 EVENING 1 Barn door fowls have gone to bed Though the sun is two yards high Ere it reach the top lands head That takes days lamp from out the sky Now the horses round the cribs Brouzes o'er the coarser hay While the ploughmen comb their ribs 'Till the evening wanes to grey 2 Then the boy with speach all hoarse Mocking the echo in the wood Brings the cows from their green close That in the hovel chew their cud Now the owl on wheaten wing And white hood scowling o'er his eyes Jerking with a sudden spring Through three-cornered barn hole flies 3 The sun is sinking low and red A coal turned dim from gazing Among the oak-trees goes to bed And sets the woods a blazing The dewy leaves will quickly drop And daylight close his eye And labours rustic sounds will stop 'Neath evenings quiet sky Feby 13th/47 SONG [I would not be a wither'd leaf] 1 I would not be a wither'd leaf Twirled in an autumn sky Mine should not be a life so brief To fade and fall and die 2 Nor would I be a wither'd flower Whose stalk was broke before The bud showed bloom in springs young hour Heart sicken'd at the core 3 But I would be a happy thought With thy sweet sleep to lie To live unknown, unseen, unsought And keep my lonely joy 4 Yes I would be a ray of light In the apple of thy eye And watch o'er thee the live long night In beauty, and in joy March 3rd/47 THE WINTERS SPRING 1 The winter comes I walk alone I want no birds to sing To those who keep their hearts their own The winter is the Spring No flowers to please—no bees to hum The coming Springs already come 2 I never want the christmas rose To come before its time The seasons each as God bestows Are simple and sublime I love to see the snow storm hing 'Tis but the winter garb of Spring 3 I never want the grass to bloom The snow-storm's best in white I love to see the tempest come And love its piercing light The dazzled eyes that love to cling O'er snow white meadows sees the Spring 4 I love the snow the crimpling snow That hangs on every thing It covers every thing below Like white doves brooding wing A landscape to the aching sight A vast expance of dazzling light 5 It is the foliage of the woods That winter's bring—The dress White easter of the year in bud That makes the winter Spring The frost and snow his poseys bring Natures white spirits of the Spring Feby 23rd/47 SONNET Wood Anemonie The wood anemonie through dead oak leaves And in the thickest woods now blooms anew And where the green briar, and the bramble weaves Thick clumps o' green, anemonies thicker grew And weeping flowers, in thousands pearled in dew People the woods and brakes, hid hollows there White, yellow and purple hued the wide wood through What pretty, drooping weeping flowers they are The clipt' frilled leaves the slender stalk they bear On which the drooping flower hangs weeping dew How beautiful through april time and may The woods look, filled with wild anemonie And every little spinney now looks gay With flowers mid brush wood and the hugh oak tree. SONNET The Primrose Sweet primrose peeping in the hazel copse Beneath the maple roots of grass green moss Where hermit woodman at his labour stops Or may be peeping by a clump of gorse Its sulphur bunches flower with brunny eye SONNET The Crow How peaceable it seems for lonely men To see a crow fly in the thin blue sky Over the woods and fealds, o'er level fen It speaks of villages, or cottage nigh Behind the neighbouring woods—when march winds high Tear off the branches of the hugh old oak I love to see these chimney sweeps sail by And hear them o'er the knarled forest croak Then sosh askew from the hid woodmans stroke That in the woods their daily labours ply I love the sooty crow nor would provoke Its march day exercises of croaking joy I love to see it sailing to and fro While feelds, and woods and waters spread below SILENT LOVE 1 The dew it trembles on the thorn Then vanishes so love is born Young love that speaks in silent thought 'Till scorned, then withers and is nought 2 The pleasure of a single hour The blooming of a single flower The glitter of the morning dew Such is young love when it is new 3 The twitter of the wild birds wing The murmur of the bees Lays of hay crickets when they sing Or other things more frail than these 4 Such is young love when silence speaks Till weary with the joy it seeks Then fancy shapes sup[p]lies 'Till sick of its own heart it dies 5 The dew drop falls at mornings hour When none are standing by And noiseless fades the broken flower So lovers in their silence die 1 [Is love a flower to bud then bloom] Is love a flower to bud then bloom And give to sunshine its perfume Then die and be as nothing where The earth of the succeeding year And is it nothing else but earth Sure it is of holier birth Not born to fade and pass away But like the heavens eternal ray Bright, beaming beautiful and high As morning in a summer sky As sunshine in sweet summer showers As colours in the sweetest flowers But love's not without shadows born Nor roses bloom without a thorn And love carressing or derided The flower and leaf is undivided Love cannot part or death desever The heart truth keeps in love for ever Nature cherisheth the flower And keeps it in a wavering hour To bloom perrennial—no decay Can ever fade the flower away Till earth becomes like heaven above The paradise of heaven like love— LOVES STORY 1 I do not love thee So I'll not deceive thee I do not love thee Yet I'm lothe to leave thee 2 I do not love thee Yet joys very essence Comes with thy footstep Is complete in thy presence 3 I do not love thee Yet when gone I sigh And think about thee 'Till the stars all die 4 I do not love thee Yet thy black bright eyes Bring to my hearts soul Heaven and paradise 5 I do not love thee Yet thy handsome ways Bring me in absence Almost hopeless days 6 I cannot hate thee Yet my love seems debtor To love thee more So hating, love thee better TO ADELAIDE 1 The may flowers are springing The wild birds are singing And beauty's face blooms in the sun and the shade The wood gales are breathing The wood bines are wreathing And may brings her pleasures for sweet Adelaide 2 The sweet smiles of heaven Says none are forgiven Who shun the grand garden that nature has made Here the scents of the briar And wild flowers we admire The air is all fragrance like sweet Adelaide 3 The sun sets and rises While its grandeur surprises How beautiful evening and morning is made The white clouds are mountains The blue skies are fountains And dear is the walk with my sweet Adelaide WEEP FOR JERUSALEM 1 Weep not for the Israelites by Babels lone streams Whose altars are waste whose dwellings are dreams For the God of their fathers, has left them a prey To the strife of the heathen to murder and slay Oh! weep for Jerusalem by the lone streams Of Babel whose dwellings are nothing but dreams 2 The heathen has swept all their dwellings away And God's holy city has fallen a prey Their altars are desolate by the lone streams Their cities are ruins, their dwellings are dreams Their land desolations lone desert—and they Like the dust which the whirlwind up gathers away 3 O weep for Jerusalem by Babels lone streams Whose shrines are all desolate, whose kingdoms are dreams Whose lands are but deserts whose children but clay Which the strife of the whirlwind up gathers away Like the ears from the sickle, the leaves in the blast Their lands and their altars are perished and past TO MARY ? 1 Mary sweet Mary the spring is returning The birds in the hedges are singing so sweet While love in my heart is continually burning As you my sweet Mary I chance oft' to meet Bright is the green of white-thorn on the hedges And sweet is the song of the cricket and bee And dear all around is the summers young pledges But Mary dear Mary is dearest to me 2 In the hedge on the hill, there the green linnet builds And the crow builds her nest in the bonny ash tree 'Tis there when the morning the summer sun gilds I wander from home love thinking of thee Sweet Mary dear Mary sweeter than summer And sweeter than wild flowers the home of the bee Every prospect at mornings dawn is a new commer As I stray from my home love thinking of thee 3 Sweet Mary dear Mary how handsome art thou Thy eyes are as bright as the sun in the stream The hedge roses blushes are warm on thy brow And you haunt me for ever like a beautiful dream Sweet Mary dear Mary I wander away Both morning and evening to think upon thee Where whiter than snow are the bushes of may And them I compare to thy beauty and thee 4 The rose is thy face and the daisey thy bosom And its pin head of gold is the brooch on thy breast I could kiss them and court them till evening dews clos'd them As the bright crimson sun dies away in the west Then I wander home lonely and love but thee only For thou'rt in every dew drop and wild flower I see 'Tis a week come next monday, since I wander'd out with thee Still Mary dear Mary you'r dearest to me [I love thee nature with a boundless love] 1 I love thee nature with a boundless love The calm of earth, the storms of roaring woods The winds breathe happiness where e'er I rove Theres lifes own music in the swelling floods My harp is in the thunder melting clouds The snow capt mountain, and the rolling sea And hear ye not the voice where darkness shrouds The heavens,—there lives happiness for me 2 Death breathes its pleasures when it speaks of him My pulse beats calmer while its lightnings play My eye with earths delusions waxing dim Clears with the brightness of eternal day The elements crash round me—it is he And do I hear his voice and never start From Eve's posterity I stand quite free Nor feel her curses rankle round my heart 3 Love is not here—hope is—and in his voice The rolling thunder and the roaring sea My pulse they leap and with the hills rejoice Then strife and turmoil is a peace to me No matter where lifes ocean leads me on For nature is my mother and I rest When tempests trouble and the sun is gone Like to a weary child upon her breast— SPRING 1 Here are violets Jessy for thy sleep Blue with the gales of Spring In dews of morn they only weep To thee they'll bloom and sing 2 Sing of green fields and freedom too When thou and I together Walked down the wood sides were they grew In springs first happy weather 3 When hawthorns they were flushed in green And hazels hung their trails When sallows shone in golden sheen And scented morning gales 4 When flowers fell down before the sun To rise on blossoms new And I a school boy used to run To pluck them love for you 5 Nor have I seen them grow more sweet Than in my native dells Where still my troubled visions meet And dearest mem'ry dwells 6 For there my wandering fancy goes In pastoral love to rest And when the wind of summer blows Where can I happier rest 7 For still my Jessy still for thee Just as those flowers were shaded By natures woods—my love shall be When every flower has faded MARY 1 Mary my wife the summer is come And mellow the note of the summer bees hum And the green fields my Mary are pleasant to see Where I in the summer went walking with thee Still Mary my wife you may bloom as a flower And summer bring to you as pleasant an hour As it did when we rambled along the old lea Yet Mary my wife no more may I see— 2 I would wander all summer, and look for wild flowers For the summer's the same and as warm are the hours As green are the bushes, and dark the oak tree As they were my own Mary when I wandered with thee When I see a wild flower or a bright bit of sky Sweet Mary my wife then ever seems nigh But when I look back the sweet vision is past And all my bright fancies have fled with the blast [Mary on the footpath ramble] 1 Mary on the footpath ramble And enjoy the sunday morn O'er the pasture hung wi' bramble And the ploughed grounds green with corn Where the lark is just a rising From its nest among the grain And all other cares despising Sings its happy songs again While years alas! now intervene Since we wandered o'er the green 2 Then I sought the ground-larks nest And its eggs I showed to thee Pluck't the wild flower for thy breast And the burdock from thy knee That clung unto thy sunday gown As through the cover we did go Where the monument looks down On the golden gorse below And shows its bright and golden flowers Like sunshine in sweet summer hours— 3 We passed the thicket then again Took the wicket to the road Where we my love did entertain Ourselves with beauties all abroad The wild flower and the meadow bee Such as My Mary never stings The butterfly, o'er land and lea For Mary would not stretch its wings She'd hurt not snail, nor kill a fly But love all life beneath the sky 4 The clouds were high and light as wool Some like feathers in a heap The awthorn shadows sweet and cool Hung o'er the spot where rest the sheep Here we formed plans for future joy And framed our path of life Here we watched the hours go by And first I called you wife But wife, and home, and children dear Are lost to me while I am here THE FOREST FLOWER 1 There's a flower in the wilderness blooming unknown Though thousands are near it, it blossoms alone The trees and the bushes hide it from view And the paths disappear ere they come where it grew 2 Though left to itself 'tis a beautiful flower Enjoying the dews and the drops of the shower Yet solitude petrifies love into stone And the forest flower's healthy hour blossoms alone 3 But go when the summer is gone from the wood In vain do we look for the place where it stood 'Tis gone like a thought from the heat of the brain And none may be like it to blossom again [How hot the sun rushes] 1 How hot the sun rushes Like fire in the bushes The wild flowers look sick at the foot of the tree Birds nests are left lonely The pewit sings only And all seems disheartened, and lonely like me 2 Baked earth and burnt furrows Where the rabbit he burrows And yet it looks pleasant beneath the green tree The crows nest look darkly O'er fallows dried starkly And the sheep all look restless as nature and me 3 Yet I love a meadow dwelling Where nature is telling A tale to the clear stream—its dearest to me To sit in green shadows While the herd turns to gadders And runs from the hums of the fly and the bee 4 This spot is the fairest The sweetest and rarest This sweet sombre shade of the bright green tree Where the morehens flag-nest On the waters calm breast Lies near to this sweet spot thats been mother to me MARY A BALLAD 1 The skylark mounts up with the morn The vallies are green with the spring The linnets sit in the whitethorn To build mossy dwellings and sing I see the thorn bush getting green I see the woods dance in the spring But Mary can never be seen Though the all cheering spring doth begin 2 I see the grey bark of the oak Look bright thro' the underwood now To the plough-plodding horses they yoke But Mary is not with her cow The birds almost whistle her name Say where can my Mary be gone The spring brightly smiles—and 'tis shame That she should be absent alone 3 The cowslips are out on the grass Increasing like crowds at a fair The river runs smoothly as glass And the barges float heavily there The milkmaid she sings to her cow But Mary is not to be seen Can Nature such absence allow At milking on pasture and green 4 When Sabbath it comes to the green The maidens are there in their best But Mary is not to be seen Though I walk till the sun's in the west I fancy still each wood and plain Where I and my Mary have strayed When I was a country swain And she was the happiest maid 5 But woods they are all lonely now And the wild flowers blow all unseen The birds sing alone on the bough Where Mary and I once have been But for months she now keeps away And I am a lonely hind Trees tell me so from day to day When waving in the wind 6 Birds tell me so upon the bough That I'm thread bare and old The very sun looks on me now A being dead and cold Once I'd a place where I could rest And love and quiet be That quiet place was Mary's breast And still a hope to me— 7 The spring comes brighter by day And brighter flowers appear And though she long has kept away Her name is ever dear Then leave me still the meadow flowers Where daffies blaze and shine Give but the springs young hawthorn bowers For then sweet Mary's mine TO MISS B 1 Odd rot it what a shame it is That love should puzzles grow That we the one we seek should miss And change from top to toe The Gilafers a Gilafer And nature owns the plan And strange a thing it is to me A man cant be a man 2 I traced the woods and mountains brow And felt as feels a man Love pleased me then that puzzles now E'en do the best I can Nature her same green mantle spread And boundless is her span The same bright sun is o'er my head But I can't be a man 3 The turf is green and fair the sky And nature still divine And summot lovely fills my eye Just like this love of mine And though I love—it may not be For do the best I can Mong such disordered company I cannot be a man 4 Th[r]ough married ties—affections ties And all the ties of love I struggled to be just and wise But just I cannot prove The Bible says that God is love I like so wise a plan But was it ordered from above That love was [not] wi' man 5 This contradiction puzzles me And it may puzzle all Was Adam thus fore doomed to be Our misery by his fall Eves fall has been a fall to me And do the best I can Woman—I neither love nor see And cannot be a man SONG [Its just upon the eve of May] 1 Its just upon the eve of May The shooting blade of corn Are hung with dew at early day And green's the hedge row thorn But these with me have naught to charm Though such were all to me When roaming round the lonely farm Where Jenny used to be For there beneath the woods dark brow I loved and cannot leave her now. 2 Without her life seems all alone I scarce can bear its noise My heart feels heavy as a stone And locks up fancys joys The sun looks from the happy sky On fields of wheat and corn The sky lark meets the light on high And singing makes the morn Beside the thorn &amp; woodside bough I loved and cannot leave her now. 3 We met on such a morn as this The sun looked on the hill But years have crept since that and this And I love Jenny still The crows had found a snug retreat Among the sweet green corn I never found a morn so sweet Since first loves hopes were born We loved beneath the white thorn bough So truly I can't leave her now. SONG [Tis evening the sky is one broad dim of gray] 1 Tis evening the sky is one broad dim of gray The hedges look dull as if mourning in green The wind winnows chill now the sun is away Yet still there is comfort while viewing the scene The grass troubles by as if hushing to sleep And something seems chearing where ever I roam For here in the core of my heart I can keep The smileing endearments that blest me at home 2 But love shall be nameless and I will be free To think of those joys when I wander alone While the beetle booms by in his night reverie And the lady bird climbs the tall grass as her own Sweet dwelling without either neighbour or guest I envy her ginnet I envy her home Compared with my home oh how happy her rest Whilst troubles pursue me where ever I roam 3 No comfort for me lived in palace or hall But the cottage that stood in a garden of flowers Where the vine and the woodbine climb'd up by the wall Twas there that I lived in my happiest hours Tis there I shall live when the strife is gone by For the sun that shines there shines on vally &amp; plain Where green fields and bushes will gladden my eye And make me contented and happy again JESSEY 1 The spring of life is o'er with me And love and all gone by Like broken bough upon yon tree I'm left to fade and die Stern ruin seized my home and me And desolate's my cot. Ruins of halls—the blasted tree Are emblems of my lot 2 I liv'd and lov'd—I woo'd and won Her love was all to me But blights fell o'er that youthful one And like a blasted tree I withered till I all forgot But Jessys smile on me She never liv'd were love was not And I from bonds was free 3 The spring it clothed the fields with pride When first we met together And there unknown to all beside We lov'd in sunny weather We met where oaks green overhead And white thorns hung with may Wild thyme beneath her feet was spread And Cows in quiet lay 4 I thought her face was sweeter far Than aught I'd seen before As simple as the cowslips are Upon the rushy moor She seem'd the muse of that sweet spot The Lady of the plain And all was dull where she was not Till love met there again SONG [How silent comes this gentle wind] 1 How silent comes this gentle wind And fans the grass and corn It leaves a thousand thoughts behind Of happiness forlorn The memory of my happier days When I was hale and young Where still my boyish fancy strays Corn fields and woods among 2 It fans among the lazy weed[s] And stirs the wild flowers leaves Sweet is the playful noise it breeds While the heart its joys receives While listening to the gentle sounds That murmer thro' the grass And much I love the airy rounds Of crows that o'er me pass 3 And larks that fly above the corn Frit by a jilted stone A few yards high at eve or morn Then drop and hide alone I love to see the breeze at eve Go winnowing oer the land And partridges their dwellings leave And call on either hand 4 I love the all—that nature loves The water earth and sky The greeness of the leafy groves Brown fallows rising high The breezes of the early morn The early evening breeze The Brown Larks mattin in the corn The rooks song in the trees 5 I love the haunts of solitude The coverts of the free Where man n'er ventures to intrude And God gives peace to me Where all I hear and all I see In peace of freedom roam Here shall my hearts own dwelling be And find itself at home SONG [The rain is come in misty showers] 1 The rain is come in misty showers The landscape lies in shrouds Patches of sunshine like to flowers Fall down between the clouds And gild the earth else where so cold With shreds like flowers of purest gold 2 And now it sweeps along the hills Just like a falling cloud The cornfields into silence stills Where musty moisture shrouds And now a darker cloud sweeps o'er The rain drops faster than before 3 The cattle graze along the ground The lark she wets her wings And chatters as she whirls around Then to the wet corn sings And hides upon her twitchey nest Refreshed with wet &amp; speckled breast 4 And I the calm delight embrace To walk along the fields And feel the rain drops in my face That sweetest pleasure yeilds They come from heaven and there the free Sends down his blessings upon me 5 I love to walk in summer showers When the rain falls gently down I love to walk a lecture hours A distance from the Town To see the drops on bushes hing And Blackbirds prune a dabbled wing HYMN [The Lord of life he reigns above] 1 The Lord of life he reigns above The Lord beneath us lives in joy The day beams from his face of love The night dress darkened majesty The thunder is his mighty voice The Lightening speaks his awful eye May we be found his lowly choice Glad travellers thro the azure sky 2 The rain his bounty ever brings The wind his health diffuses wide Throughout all nature King of Kings Where nothing equal reigns beside Bright as the ever living sun His birthless endless living light From everlasting sources run Eternity still burning bright 3 The Lord of life prepares for me This gay green earth this lower sphere Supports my steps or weak I be And guides me on from year to year Lord of my birthright and my home Lord of the earth the air and sea Watch thou my footsteps while I roam My Keeper and protector be SONNET [How beautiful the white thorn shews its leaves] How beautiful the white thorn shews its leaves The first in springs beginnings march or close Of April and how very green it weaves The branches in the underwood they burst More green than grass the common eye receives Pleasures o'er green white thorn clumps in the wood So beautifully green it seems at first It does the eye that gazes on it good The green enthusaism of young spring The Blackbird chooses it from all the wood With moss to build his early nest and sing Among the leaves the young are snugly nurst Mornings young dew wets each pinfeathered wing Before a bunch of May was from its white knobs burst. [The leaves of Autumn drop by two's and three's] The leaves of Autumn drop by two's and three's And the black cloud hung o'er the old low church Is fixed as is a rock that never stirs But look again and you may well perceive The weather cock is in another sky And the cloud passing leaves the blue behind Crimson &amp; yellow bloch'd with Iron Brown The Autumn tans and varigates the leaves The nuts are ripe in woods about the Town Russet the cleared fields where the bindweed weaves Round stubbles and still flowers the trefoil seeds And troubles all the land from rig to furrow Ther's nothing left but rubbish and foul weeds I love to see the rabbits snug made burrow Under the old edge bank or hugh mossed oak Claspt fast with Ivy there the rabbit breeds Where the Kite pelews and the Ravens croak And hares and Rabbits at their leisure feed So varying Autumn thro her changes runs Season of sudden storms and brillient suns. SONG [A man may mourn a man may sigh] 1 A man may mourn a man may sigh Left under mans dominion And here if woman charms his eye His freedom leaves a pinion They rob him of his liberty Each hope of being free Is taken by an evil eye That feeds on slavery O Love is but a Butterfly Fond of Green fields and the blue sky 2 Aye love is fond of liberty Green vallys and bright flowers Sings seeking honey with the bee For all the summer hours A silent solitary thing That lives within itself You only see his azure wing That flies from pride and pelf O Love is like a Butterfly Fond of green fields and purple sky 3 This love's a very tender thing That withering fades from crime A singing bee without a sting A flower in frost and rime More tender then the simple maid Who from seduction flies More fair then flowers that love can braid The birth of Paradise SONG [Sukey's rare and Sukey's fair] 1 Sukey's rare and Sukey's fair Sukey's got the coal black hair And in her neck the curl'd drakes tail That makes her looks so very fine And in her breast this heart of mine That keeps me like a thief in jail Which is so very fair and white It keeps me waken half the night 2 Sukey's neat, and Sukey's sweet Sukey's every way complete Like a lily in the shower Rich as kingcup in the spring The colour of the bridal ring Queen of blossom of the bower Bespangled with the morning dew And paved with clumps of violets blue 3 Sukey's young, and Sukey's song The market hill with music rung And Sukey's ballad there Her neck was white her cheek was red Just like the sun a going bed And coal black was her hair A bulfinch on a blackthorn tree Warnt half so beautiful as she 4 The crowds among, I heard it sung The market with the ballad rung The fiddle played so sweet And Sukey tall stood near the wall And heard the fiddle song and all And I could some repeat About her waist, her lips, and eyes More rich than flowers or butterflies 5 Sukey's rare and Sukey's fair Sukey's blythe and debonair Love lives in every place White as lilies and as sweet Small white hands, and smaller feet And beautiful her face As roseys in the morning dew As violets in their veils of blue 6 Sukey's rare, and Sukey's fair Sukey's got the coal black hair And in her neck the curled drakes tail That makes her look so sweet and fine And in her breast this heart of mine That keeps me like a thief in jail That swells so very fair and white I cannot sleep a wink at night SONG [The rushbeds touched the boiling spring] 1 The rushbeds touched the boiling spring And dipped and bowed and dipped again The nodding flower would wabbling hing Till it could scarce get back again How pleasant lay the daisey plain How twisting sweet the woodbine grew Around the white thorn in the lane Bedecked with gems of droppled dew— 2 Here Bloomfield lay beside the brook His memory haunts the silver flood Musing upon the open book In happy and poetic mood His fancies left on every place The landscape seems his waking dream Where Hannah shewed her rosey face ‘And leap't across the infant stream’ 3 The rush tufts touched the boiling sand Then wabbling nodded up anew Then danced at every winds command And dipped to peirce the water through The twisted woodbine was in flower And pale among the thorn leaves grew Here Bloomfield rested many an hour While bees they sipped the morning dew 4 The little spring it boiled away And dancing rose the silver sand For ever boiling night and day And never made an idle stand The wild flower nodded on the brink And made its wrinkles on the stream Where Bloomfield often lay to think And listless spend his summer dream [There is a thought in every human breast] There is a thought in every human breast A hope for better when the worst is bye The poor man dreams on't in his nightly rest And sees the Almighty in the evening sky On thrones of gold sublimely sailing bye Smiling upon him—that all sins forgiven In one so harmless—shedding beams of joy He thinks that wealth will make all trouble even If not on earth God grants it all in heaven SONG [Bonny hills and bosky braes] 1 Bonny hills and bosky braes I maun leave them a' lassie Where thy happy shadow strays Still in fancies e'e lassie Bonny hills, and flowing fountains Siller lakes, and heather mountains Music from each bush rebounding My love maun leave them a' lassie And the headlong tumbling Linn Where thy sweet

lassie Far away from love, and Pheobe With two eyes as bright as Hebe Solitude alone will see thee In this pleasant place lassie Where the water runs so clearly Where I love thee a sa' dearly Sitting on my knee or nearly By the gentle spring lassie 3 Bonny hills and bosky braes I maun leave them a' lassie Farther than the ocean strays Desserts, seas and a' lassie Where thy sweet form never rested Where thy sma' foot never pressed it The sun burnt up, and syne he blessed it There I'm gaun to stray lassie I kiss thee by the siller fountain Farewell—ere e'ening blues the mountain I'm gaun. But Hope saes ills surmounting I'll come another day lassie [Thy spirit visits me like dew] 1 Thy spirit visits me like dew That glistens on the flowers Falling in the morning blue And in the evening hours The wild flowers have a feeling O'er my calm senses stealing And love's soft dreams revealing Seem wispering from the bowers 2 The foxgloves freckled bells That blossom by the wood And in the forrest dells In the midst of solitude There I hear my lover call Where the whitethorn forms a wall And the foxglove blossoms tall In the tears of eve bedewed 3 Spirit thou of every place Where loves memories are left Places green as years of grace Where hope lives of love bereft My love lives in these green places Where woodbine the white thorn embraces Far from the crowd of worldly faces Here loves spirit still is left SONG The maid of the Desert 1 My home is not here it lies in the land Where houses nor cities appear Where the tent by the jungle is pitched on the sand And the lion roars awfully near There the maid of the desert did plight me her troth Which I pledged in affection and truth Yes that is the land and my heritage both With the friends of her kindred and youth 2 Sweet maid of the desert as fresh as the flower That blooms round thy tent in the morn I've spent in thy solitudes many an hour The sweetest e'er since I was born Sweet maid of the desert the mountains so grand Tower dark o'er thy beautiful brow As fair as the lily alone on the strand In the depths of the desert art thou 3 Sweet maid of the desert the cross on thy brow Is richer than gems of the east Truth bloomed in thy childhood and warms thy love now That burns in thy beautiful breast Sweet maid of the desert thou rose of the west Thou gem of the earth and the sea While love is the diamond that decks thy white breast My hope waits thy lover to be AUTUMN 1 I love the fitfull gusts that shakes The casement all the day And from the mossy elm tree takes The faded leaf away Twirling it by the window pane With thousand others down the lane 2 I love to see the shaking twig Dance till the shut of eve The sparrow on the cottage rig Whose chirp would make believe That spring was just now flirting by In summers lap with flowers to lie 3 I love to see the cottage smoke Curl upwards through the naked trees The pigeons nestled round the coat On dull november days like these The cock upon the dunghill crowing The mill sails on the heath agoing 4 The feather from the ravens breast Falls on the stubble lea The acorns near the old crows nest Fall pattering down the tree The grunting pigs that wait for all Scramble and hurry where they fall SONG To—R. W. 1 Fare thee well thou pleasant place And all that looks above the[e] There Rebecca with her angel face Sat on the grass to love me I held her in my fond embrace 'Till the moonshine smiled above me 2 Blue violets bloomed 'neath arum leaves The white-thorn spread to hide me And catkins round the willow weaves Where Rebecca sat beside me Where spiders beaded lacework weaves She wished good luck betide me 3 Fare thee well thou pleasant place Where willows wave above thee There Rebecca with her happy face Sat on the grass to love me I held her in my fond embrace 'Till the moonshine smiled above me SONG To—E. B. 1 Emma my darling the summer is bye The autumn is faded and cloudy the sky The willows are changing—the hips and the hawe's Now glow on the hedges—as red as birds claws 'Till fieldfairs come from far far away And carry off berries and hips all the day Winds sing in the hedges like notes of a bird And the sedges they cut like the edge of a sword 2 The hedges will shelter my Emma and me As we walk down the wood neath the wind shaking tree The seugh through the hedges, the swop of black crows How the bushy tops dance, and how swift the mill goes How sweet the flags rustle, how swift the waves run While the river-lock bombs like the sound of a gun The coots like to snow flakes sweep o'er the flood track And the grim clouds above them look angry &amp; black 3 So come my dear Emma lets walk in the fields The fields of November a pleasant walk yields There's the roost robbing reynard and the hounds in full cry The still sweeing crows—pigeon flocks sewing by The mellow brown fields—and the leaf littered brook How sweet to the fancy of Emma they'll look So come dearest Emma we'll up and away A ramble in Autumn's as sweet as in May— SONG [Sweeter than the blossomed beans] 1 Sweeter than the blossomed beans Where the bind weed, bell-flower leans Than beauty in her teens Is love Than roses on the briar I' the summer o' the year By the waters running clear Sweeter is love She's the first flower all the year The maid I love 2 The black upon the bean The streak in bell-flowers Seen Is the eye and neck I wean Of Love The blush upon the rose In her bonny ripe cheek glows— Than any flower that blows Sweeter is love Less rich the ruby glows Than her I love 3 She's a living lily flower A rose tree in a shower A fond perenial flower Is love No death affects its flower No mildew blights its bower Than Edens sun or shower Sweeter is love Heavens first eternal hour Is her I love SONG [Theres the wide spreading heath and its crowds of furze bushes] 1 Theres the wide spreading heath and its crowds of furze bushes The apple-top't oak, and the crippled thorn tree And the small bending valley o'erspread with bowed rushes, That wave to the wind—and the song of the bee Singing round summer wild flowers In all sunny mild hours In freedom and glee While the low wharping camp among the green bushes Forms a warm cozey nest for Maria and me 2 The beautiful gipsey with brown swarthy cheek And a bosom of snow melting under her gown If you travelled the country round for a week You'd find none so handsome in village or town As lovely Maria And my eyes never tire Beneath the green tree To gaze on her arms and her sunny tanned cheek While we sit in the camp sweet Maria and me 3 The wheatear it sits on the thorn in the breakan The furze linet sits on the apple top't oak And the fire-tail weets there as its nest had been taken And the cuckoo sings plain as if somebody spoke While lovely Maria By the crackling fire Unlinks her dark hair That falls o'er her shoulders a thunder cloud making And covers her neck so lovely and fair SONG [O haud yer tongues ye sylvan elves] 1 O haud yer tongues ye sylvan elves Yer gladness is but waes And keep yer sangs within yer selves, For may be better days Another birdie sings to me Mak's ither music vain And fills my heart wi' sorrows glee Till pleasure springs frae pain Sae haud yer tongues ye sylvan elves And keep yer singing to yer selves 2 I wish I lived in upper skies Beyond the golden starn Angels wi' mercy in their eyes My secret thoughts might learn O' for the luv of those bright een When you war sorrows ain Makes my e'en sick o' places green My heart cauld as a stane Sae haud yer tongues ye sylvan elves And keep yer singing to yer selves 3 O Susie, Susie, why sae coy When I am by yer side Ye never luik ane kind reply My simple love to guide Sae haud yer tongues ye saucy elves I've ither sangs to hear And keep yer singing to yer silves While Susie's musing here O Susie Susie let me see Thy ain hearts simple melodie SONG [Honey dew falls from the tree] 1 Honey dew falls from the tree Where my Julia walks with me With her white arm held in mine Luscious smells the eglantine In blushes sleeps the rosey briar Lit with tiney sparks of fire As the red-hot sun goes down Like a ball to fire the town. 2 Glow-worms fire the dark green grass Where my Julia's small feet pass And the king-cups rimmed wi' dew Gold and white and pearly blue Tap her on her evening track Sandal shoes with ribbons black And woodbines with a crimson streak Nod again her bonnet peak. 3 The pearly west glowed golden charms While I held Julia in my arms Sweet Julia with the eye of dew The heath bell has'n't one so blue Her neck the lily of the vale Is not so fair and sweetly pale Her cheek, the rose crop't in the dew Is not so blushing in its hue. 4 I kissed her, yes I kissed her twice While the little whistling mice From the hedge ran in and out And bounced the silver dews about I leaned upon my Julia's cheek And could have rested there a week But we returned to our repose Just as the full round moon arose. EVENING How beautiful the eve comes in The grazing kine the village din Of happy children, cocks and hens And chickens cheeping in their pens And hogs that grunt the roots to eat And dogs asleep on their fore-feet And sparrows on the mossy thatch Waiting whatever they may catch Beneath the oak the old cart shed There the capon goes to bed On the old crippled waggon-see Propped up with an axle-tree By the wall on broken rail Tweets red breasted firetail And their neighbours pied flycatch Build cobweb nest in the old thatch Where beesom weed—that high wind leaves Blossoms and blooms above the eaves The old cow-crib is mossed and green As if it just had painted been The ramping kecks in orchard gaps Shake like green neighbours in white caps On which the snail will climb and dwell For three weeks in its painted shell There the white nosed ‘clock a clay’ Red and black spot[t]ed sits all day Round which the white nosed bee will hum To which the black nosed bee will come More than a hundred times a day Till evening shadows cool in grey Wormwood, burdock—the cart conceals Rotting and wanting both the wheels The battered waggon wanting three Stands prop't with broken axle-tree A hen pen with two slats away And hen and chickens gone astray A barrow left without a wheel Since spring, which nettles now conceal From free stones getting on the moor The creeping donkeys pass the door The geese on dunghills clean their quills And squabble o'er the dainty pills Thrown out by the huswifes cares Who supper for her man prepares Labour returning from its toils Ditcher that the earth besoils Hedgers from the wattled thorn Scaring birdboy with his horn Who blows it to the wandering moon And thinks the village knows the tune The shepherd in the nearly dark Followed by his dogs gruff bark The milkmaid tripping through the dew Singing all the evening through The owlet through the barn hole peeps And all the village hides and sleeps. PRAYER IN THE DESERT 1 Almighty, omnipotent—dweller on high Protector of earth and its dwellers—thine eye Can look on this desert and bid it appear As green as fresh pastures at spring of the year And bid the earth's fatness bring food at command And refill the cruise that is dry as the sand Almighty omnipotent—dweller in bliss Thy will has the power—and thy power can do this 2 Our food is exhausted—the cruises are dry But thou art almighty—thy power can supply Abundant for few—and sufficient for all Alli our father let charity fall While earth is our mother leave nature our friend And this bare arid desert abundance shall send This desert of sand shall produce from thine eye Of food and of water sufficient supply 3 Thou God of Mahomet thou father of all Near hell and destruction on Alla we call We bow to the sand in our faith not in fear For God in the word of his prophet is here We pray in the faith of Mahomet and trace The desert of sand as thy own dwelling place Almighty omnipotent hear us, and send Supply to our wants, and our prophet defend [In April all the lanes and woods are full of] In April all the lanes and woods are full of Primroses violets and wood anemonies Theres many a bunch or branch of may they pull off Littered on roads, in lanes, by woods, where many has Broke off as first in leaf—and sweet as any is Violet, and primrose gathered and thrown down To fade where they were plucked—this rush swamp rather fenny is Yet smell smock show their lilac up and down And mosses green as grass among the brown. SONG [Though years may part my love from me] 1 Though years may part my love from me My heart shall true &amp; faithful be, Though seas again between us roll My heart's the needle to the pole, 2 Still pointing true to thee &amp; home; Whenever I may stay or roam The love long true I had for thee Like suns that never set shall be. 3 Memory of thee shall still prevail, Thy voice shall cheer the morning gale And should I cross the blue sea wave, And should I fill a foreign grave, 4 Thy early smiles, &amp; face so fair The memory's dreams shall bless me there, Smile in each wave around me spread And bloom upon my lowly bed— 5 If there it be my lot to sleep Thy spirit in the dews shall weep And in the evening wind shall sigh And bless me where I lowly lie. SONG [Where the ash tree weaves] 1 Where the ash tree weaves Shadows over the river And the willow's grey leaves Shake and quiver— Meet me &amp; talk, love, Down the grass-hoppers baulk, love, And then love for ever— 2 There meet me, &amp; talk, love, Of love's inward feelings Where the clouds look like chalk, love, And the huts &amp; the shielings Lie like love o'er the river Here talk of love's feelings, And love on for ever— 3 Where the bee hums his ballads By the river so near it, Round docks &amp; wild salads While all love to hear it, We'll meet by the river, And by old willow pollards Bid love live for ever.

SANG [There is a land, I ken it weel] 1 There is a land, I ken it weel Whose mountains touch the clouds, Where pine-woods in the tempests reel And eagles scream aloud; A land of which a' hearts are proud, That to that mountain neuk belang, That land o' mist, &amp; storm, &amp; cloud, Is dearest to my sang— 2 It is the native's dearest hame On every foreign strand, He sees it there in heart the same, His ain, his native land; Where the fir trees frowning stand O'er the huge rocks black &amp; strang, Where the Bruce aince gave command That's the burden of his sang— 3 T'is the heart o' every Scot When he leaves his ain hearth stane, His eye can see it not, But tis in heart his ain; He sees the hill &amp; plain Where he herded a' day lang, When Scotland was his ain, And the fire-side heard his sang— SONG [The autumns come again] The autumns come again &amp; the clouds descend in rain &amp; the leaves they are falling from the wood The summer's voice is still Save the clacking of the mill &amp; the lowly muttered thunder of the flood There's nothing in the mead But the rivers muddy speed &amp; the willow leaves all littered by its side Sweet voices all are still In the vale &amp; on the hill &amp; the summer's blooms are withered in their pride Fled is the cuckoo's note To countries far remote &amp; the nightingale is vanished from the wood If you search the Lordship round There is not a blossom found &amp; where the haycock scented is the flood My true loves fled away Since we walked in cocks of hay On the sabbath in the summer of the year &amp; she's nowhere to be seen On the meadow or the green But she's coming when the happy spring is near When the birds begin to sing &amp; the flowers begin to spring &amp; the cowslips in the meadows reappear When the woodland oaks are seen In their monarchy of green Then Mary &amp; loves pleasure will be here SONG [I would not think thee half so fair] 1 I would not think thee half so fair Had I not known that thou excelled The fairest that were blooming there If not the sweetest I beheld T'was so &amp; more than so to me For none could smile so sweet as thee— 2 Calm Sunday noons, &amp; moonlight eves How beautiful they made thee seem— The poet such a vision weaves As thou wert—seen in angel dreams, A maiden soon to be a bride With nought so beautiful beside— 3 We find a flower upon our walk In places where we thought none grew I saw thy smiles &amp; heard thee talk I thought none there as sweet as you T'was so when last we met—the while— Could absence e'er forget that smile— 4 I could'nt—and I loved thee more When late in hidden thought I met thee Than e'er I seemed to do before —I saw, where I could not forget thee When moonlight walks their views unfurled And left thee fairest in the world 5 The best, the fairest &amp; the dearest— The moon looked silent o'er our love The only witness and the nearest To thoughts as angels are above I thought of thee &amp; only thee And felt that such was thine for me— 6 The moonlight walk—the rustic stile Where she was richly seated Her fine grey eyes owned every smile Wi' which true love was treated T'was heaven there &amp; so t'will be The next time that I meet wi' thee— THE SOLDIERS GRAVE 1 No matter how the strife begins Soldiers who fall the battle wins Left dead beside his thundering gun That corpse the battle field has won Though on the turf he ends his days It blossoms with his countrys praise In fireside hopes and infants smiles He fell and fame rewards his toils 2 The stars of earth white daisies shade The greensward where his bones are laid Above his bones his blood was spilt His sword rusts broken to the hilt His gun his bretheren wheeled away Belched fire and thunder in the fray Beneath the turf his ashes rest By every patriots wishes blest 3 His love was to his country true His fate is wept by mornings dew And though his hopes were warm in vain To see his childrens smiles again That by the door still sit and play While he lies rotting in the clay The mother o'er the youngest sighs And crops the daisey where he lies 4 Upon his cold and stubborn breast The speckled lark has built her nest The hare makes there her hiding form Just where the heart-blood trickled warm And stained the daisies round the place Where he fell dead and left no trace Yet there he fell and there he sleeps Where wild thyme every morning weeps THE SPIRIT OF LOVE 1 The spirit of Love is a beautiful thing As ever o'er flowers and fair bosoms took wing As ever broke silence through innocent lips More sweet than the nectar the butterfly sips From the breath of the rose tree sprinkled with dew O Love is as sweet and as innocent too The spirit of Love is an innocent thing As ever o'er flowers and fair bosoms took wing 2 Not a sigh e'er escapes it to shew to the eye Of her he adores that a lover is nigh His eye thinks a language—and turns on her dress What no tongue has spoken, no wisper can guess. The language of love is as still as the grave Its hopes are the sweetest that life ever gave The spirit of Love is an innocent thing As ever o'er flowers and fair bosoms took wing 3 Its fancies are sweet as the blossoms of spring Its thoughts are as rich as the songs seraphs sing Its love is the apple the ball of the eye Who's light is loves language—a silent reply The eve when we courted—the field where we met Like the fire of the soul warms the fond bosom yet O the spirit of Love is an innocent thing As ever o'er flowers and fair bosoms took wing SONG [At closing day and early morn] 1 At closing day and early morn Among green woods and rushes I loved her in youths early dawn Beneath the white thorn bushes When white may hid their green gloss leaves. O'er violet banks all sweetness When like green leaves her bosom heaves All happy thoughts and neetness— 2 She lived along the way side 'Mong briars and brambles many The dust ne'er soiled her bonny pride Her face was first of any The sweetest bloom amid the brown The rose hue young and shy I loved her when the sun went down At milking of the kye 3 I loved her all the summer long And when it went away Her cheek so fair—her years so young My love was bound to stay How pleasantly the path way seemed That went her dwelling by The setting sun how bright it gleamed At milking of the kye 4 The docks and thistles by the door Begemmed by summer showers Henbane ne'er looked so bright before All might be reckoned flowers The very sparrows sung a song How rich the bright blue sky I loved her all the summer long At milking of the kye 5 The swallows almost touched the road So low they dart in may The mallow flowers fanned all abroad The gnats were whewed away O pleasantly the sun got up And wandered o'er the sky When for sweet cowslips I would stoop At milking of the kye 6 How pleasantly the sun went down Behind the cots and dairies The cobwebs o'er the bents of down Seemed muslin gowns for fairies What pleasure glowed on every thing Left green beneath the sky The jenny-wren would sweetly sing At milking of the kye SONG [Scenes of love and days of pleasure] 1 Scenes of love and days of pleasure I must leave them all lassie Scenes of love and hours of leisure All are gone for aye lassie No more thy velvet bordered dress My fond and longing een shall bless Thou lily in a wilderness And who shall love thee then lassie Long I've watched thy look so tender Often clasped thy waist so slender Heaven in thy love defend her When I'm o'er the sea lassie 2 By the falls of proud Niagara Soon I'll hear the roar lassie Then I'll think of bonny Mary On a foreign shore lassie Where the dog star burns and broils And the chasms chaldron boils Whose spray the very heaven assails There I'm going to bide lassie 3 By all the faith I've shown afore thee I'll sware by more than that lassie By heaven and earth I'll still adore thee Though we should part for aye lassie By thy infant years so

erreth never I'm thine for aye and all lassie SONG Milking o' the Kye 1 Young Jenny wakens at the dawn Fresh as carnations newly blawn And o'er the pasture every morn Goes milking o' the kye, She sings her songs o' happy glee While round her swirls the angry bee The butterfly from tree to tree Goes gaily flirting bye 2 Young Jenny was a bonny thing As ever wakened in the spring And blythe she to herself could sing At milking o' the kye She loved to hear the old crows croak Upon the ash tree and the oak And noisy pies that almost spoke At milking o' the kye 3 As sweet as may upon the thorn As sweet as blue caps i' the corn Red as corn poppies newly blawn Was Jenny with the kye Her cap was white, its ribbons blue Her gown was drab her heart was true Her apron whity brown and blue At milking o' the kye 4 She crop't the wild thyme every night Scenting so sweet the dewy light And hid it in her breast so white At milking o' the kye I met and clasped her in my arms The finest flower on twenty farms Her snow white breast my fancy warms At milking o' the kye RECOLECTIONS OF HOME 1 When we stray far away from the old pleasant village We love it the fonder the further away The sweet pleasant songs of ploughmen oer their tillage Are more pleasant sounds than the strange calls to day That sweet little homestead with pollard ash and pond Leads back a hundred miles wherever I may roam A dove cotes wooden home where the pigeons coo so fond Soon brings to my eye my own at the old house at home 2 The very layer of crab that's wattled in the hedge The old post in its red paint crushed with waggons rushing through The teazles prickly burrs or the little hubs of sedge Will bring me to the old place where I lived a moon ago But the flowers here they tell me in their brown, red, white &amp; blue That their sisters are now in the fields around my house at home Though the sun here shines as bright, and as christal be the dew They are not so sweet as those flowers that in our meadows grew 3 A mossy plank across the flood though weedy be the dyke Here fifty miles away and I cross another stream It brings me to my own fields the brigs so very like So here I only wander in the middle of a dream At home I did right cozie and lived as I would choose And saw nothing but my sweet fields day after day 'Till I was forced to flee my corner and the muse As the linnet from its nest by the awk is drove away 4 I always see a bit of home in every likely thing A white-thorn hedge, or bramble bush or pollard willow tree Brings me my own snug homestead, and the budding of the spring SONG The old house at Home 1 O there is no other home but the old house at home And go where we will We are all uneasy still For want of the corner seat and our fire at home The place from which we come There's nothing in the wide world like one's home 2 O there's nothing in the world that is so wide Seek for pleasure as we may Its a dull and cloudy day That takes us from the bright blink of our own fire side The fire place so wide There's nothing in the world like our own fire side 3 O its home, and its home, be true to your home Though the world is e'er so wide There's nothing else beside Like the cottage where we lived, and the place from whence we came Gold and silver cannot claim The master or the power of our own fire side SONG [I saw her crop a rose] 1 I saw her crop a rose Right early in the day And I went to kiss the place Where she broke the rose away And I saw the patten rings Where she o'er the stile had gone And I love all other things Her bright eyes look upon If she looks upon the hedge, or up the leafing tree That white thorn and the brown oak are the dearest things to me 2 I have a pleasant hill Which I sit upon for hours Where she cropt some sprigs of thyme And other little flowers And she muttered as she did it As does beauty in a dream And I loved her when she hid it On her breast so like to cream Near the brown mole on her neck—that like a diamond shone Then my eye was like to fire—but my heart was like a stone 3 There is a small green place Where cowslips early curled Which on sabbath days I trace The dearest in the world A little oak spreads o'er it And throws a shadow round A green-sward close before it The greenest ever found There is not a woodland nigh, nor is there a green grove Yet there the maid stood nigh me and told me all her love BOYS &amp; SPRING 1 To see the Arum early shoot Its cone curled leaves of green About the white green mossy root Where violet buds are seen 2 The little round hole in the roots Looks battered hard and round The mice come out to chimble fruits And take hips under ground 3 The husks of hips and awes lie round All chimbled seed and skin There noses now peep from the ground And there the tails bob in 4 The nettles yellow roots are bare Where sun shine looks about Where thin and pricked the hedges are The leaves are sprouting out 5 The violets blossom where they dwell The childrens fingers smart They kiss the place to make it well And all is joy of heart 6 There's something yet in childhoods ways On which I love to dwell And oft I hunt in springs first days The painted pooty shell 7 Children e're they go to school Hunt hedges and thorn roots They're badgers by the sedgy pool And b[u]y the [painted poots] 8 And then they crush them nib to nib Agen the meadow brig And don't their little tongues run glib At running such a rig 9 They call them cocks and so they fight A little ‘cocking day’ The hardest breaks the whole outright As heroe of the day STANZAS— [I would not pull a weed away] 1 I would not pull a weed away Where she stooped down to see I would not pull a branch of may Where she admired the tree 2 Like any child her quiet mind Had love for every thing The dangerous of the reptile kind She never feared a sting 3 Upon a worm I would not tread Nor even crush the snake For she would stroke its spotted head And leave it in the brake 4 I would not wrong the meanest thing That she had deign'd to touch To every flower my eyes would cling I loved her smiles so much 5 I had love for all she looked upon And love for all she did The roads looked love where she had gone As stranger paths ne'er did 6 The valley where I saw her gown Floating in the wind A shower of may-bloom snowing down Is pictured on my mind 7 I saw her by the river sedge In green gown floating gay The may bloom winnowed from the hedge And whitened all the way HYMN TO THE CREATOR 1 Almighty creator and ruler as well Of the earth and the heaven and darkness and hell We adore thee—and worship as simple as when Adam knelt in the garden the first of all men The God of that sun that yet brings the broad day When Eve the first flower in the first garden lay That mercy that yet ever falls from the sky Says that the meanest of beings never shall die 2 Almighty creator of all we behold The mountains bare rock and the meadows all gold The wilderness old and the desert of sand Are his in his glory and wild barren land To cheer and to cherish in wonder and love The earth well as heaven, his dwellings above Almighty creator to seek and to save We need from the cradle thy help to the grave 3 We need thee and fear thee so ought we to fear When thou hast no mercy none other will hear And mercy thou shewest every day to our land In keeping us all as the work of thy hand In helping the feeble in seeking the lost For man neither springs from a pillar or post But breath[e]s from his father eternally yet His hell or his heaven in mercy is met 4 Almighty creator of heaven and earth Creations protector its life and its birth In thee all began and in thee all have end Our father at first and at last the one friend We love and adore thee or ought so to do From the sunrise of morning to evenings bright dew Through morning and evening and blackest midnight Thou'rt our faith in nights darkness and love in morns light SONG [My Peggy's a young thing my Peggy's a gay thing] 1 My Peggy's a young thing my Peggy's a gay thing As straight and as tall as a poplar tree My Peggy's a gay thing my Peggy's a play thing Where e're you see Peggy you'r sure to see me My Peggy's as fair as a hundred together My Peggy's as sweet as a sweet briar tree Content to the one soon found out the other So content it soon settled young Peggy and me 2 So I crop here full early to put in a posey And I knew what I loved must fade and soon wither With blue bell and red pink carnation and rosey But Peggy was root, leaf and flower all together From morning to evening we could not be parted For love from the first to the last made us one At ev'en so cozey we walked out glad hearted And then we went church and were no longer one 3 So now we are seen all the day both together As happy or happier than many gay things For better for worse the one took the other And Peggy's a goddess without any wings So she never flew from me nor wished to be parted My Peggy was fond as a pigeon of me She made the plain home we lived in glad hearted And fed the sweet linnets that sang on the tree 4 My Peggy was handsome my Peggy was tall As straight and as trim as a poplar tree As sweet as the woodbine nail'd up to the wall Haunted all summer long with songs of the bee My Peggy's a young thing my Peggy's a gay thing And where you see Peggy you'r sure to see me For Peggy's my own thing, and Peggy's my plaything And dear I love Peggy as Peggy loves me SONG The maid in the morning 1 The linnit sat upon its nest By gales o' morning softly prest His green wing and his greener breast Was damp wi' dews o' morning The dog rose neath the oak tree grew Blush'd swelling neath a veil o' dew A pinks nest to its prickles grew Right early i' the morning 2 The sunshine glittered gold the while A country maiden clomb the stile Her straw hat couldn't hide the smile That blushed like early morning The lark with feathers all wet through Looked up above the glassy dew And to the neighbouring corn field flew Fanning the gales o' morning 3 In every bush was heard a song Each green grass blade the whole way long A silver shining drop there hung The milky dews o' morning Where stepping stones strides o'er the brook The rosy maid I overtook How ruddy was her healthy look So early in the morning 4 I took her by the well turn'd arm And led her over field and farm And kiss'd her o'er her cheek so warm A rose in early morning The spiders lace work shone like glass Tied to flowers and cat tail grass The dew drops bounced before the lass Sprinkling the early morning 5 Her dark curls fanned among the gales The sky lark whistled o'er the vales I told her loves delightful tales Among the dews o' morning She cropt a flower shook off the dew And on her breast the wild rose grew She blush'd as fair, as lovely too The living rose o' morning A LAMENT I cannot if I would be gay 1 I cannot if I would be gay Nor love what I adored Strife stole my feelings all away Nor e'er a thought restored I felt a love for many things That would in raptures fall Creations light on varied wings And woman most of all 2 I loved them with a Poets love And loved them as a man I loved them as the blest above And will do while I can I loved them for a better place Birds woman flowers and grass And worship on the red rose face Of every bonny lass 3 My muses they—and Poets too The sum of every song I see them in the sun and dew And all the year long Angels on earth they are and give Me feelings thoughts and tears Fond hopes new feelings still to live A longer length of years 4 To live and see when strife shall cease And kindred kindred meet A land of love of health and peace In cottage town and street The winds shall blow and rivers flow And clouds slow sail above When earth shall turn to heaven below And love be lost in love EVENING 1 The sun had gaen down on the mountain sae lofty And left her bright spots on the hills and the sky And the dew fa' o' e'en came around me so softly As still as the wings o' the bee passing by O come on ye balmy soft shades o' the e'enin And langer above me remain thou calm sky O blue gold and crimson like lofty rocks leaning Seeming ready to fa' from their dwellings so high 2 Ye shades green and siller o' lakes and o' mountains Soft greensward blebbed o'er with the milk o' nights dew The bull rushy lake and the mossy fringed fountains How dearly I love the mild e'enin' so blue Brushing green broom by the side o' my true love Whose green twigs are sprinkled wi' pin heads o' dew The goudspink cheeps sleepy, half asleep cooes the blue dove Where I went wi' my true love in her neat dress o' blue 3 O she was the rarest the bonniest, fairest The dearest sincerest and but yet a young thing O she was the prettiest wittiest and sweetest But she seldom spoke love on our walks i' the spring The sunset clouds faded in dewy mists braided We saw not as far as we did when we came She thought of her bonnet the dews falling on it So arm in arm I—and my lassie went hame PLEASANT SOUNDS The rustling of leaves The rustling of leaves under the feet in woods and under hedges. The crumping of cat-ice and snow down wood rides, narrow lanes and every street causeways. Rustling through a wood, or rather rushing while the wind hallows in the oak tops like thunder. The rustles of birds wings startled from their nests, or flying unseen into the bushes. The whizzing of larger birds over head in a wood, such as crows, puddocks, buzzards &amp;c. The trample of roburst wood larks on the brown leaves, and the patter of Squirrels on the green moss. The fall of an acorn on the ground, the pattering of nuts on the hazel branches, ere they fall from ripeness. The flirt of the ground-larks wing from the stubbles, how sweet such pictures on dewy mornings when the dew flashes from its brown feathers. TO MISS MARY ANN C. 1 There is a land of endless life Where lovers pass away And leave these coarser scenes of strife And unrefined clay A land of love and pure delight In never fading flowers There Mary's love shall take its flight From this cold world of ours 2 Thy beaming eyes shall brighter be Thy cheeks pure roses glow Thy person with the clime agree More white than driven snow That bosom in itself a soul Shall be immortal soon Where each one hides a happy mole Like burs around the moon 3 Thyself shall be the angel there Mid scenes for ever green In flowers for ever bright and fair Shall Mary live serene I'll kiss the mole on either breast Where mortals ne'er reprove And share in my eternal rest Her everlasting love TO MARY 1 I wish I had for well I know Her bonny breast was a' my own I wish I had explained it so What now for ever keeps unknown I saw her bonny breast so white I saw her bonny face so fair I saw her beaming eyes so bright But ne'er said what I likened there I likened her in love so true An angel and a woman too 2 I saw her smile on inward thoughts I saw her heart resigned and pure I saw her face with beauty frought And felt first loves election sure I thought of love but nothing said No wispers from my gazing fell In my own bosom born and bred Mary where do I love so well By evil eyes at close of day My wild hedge rose was stole away 3 From thee they stole my e'en away My bonny bride of high degree Else the wild rose at close of day My hope and love had used to be Its dewy leaves of carmine stain I to thy sweet face would compare I kissed the cups tween joy and pain Cause Mary's bosom was not there I kissed them as truths love and glee I likened her's as true to me— 4 The moon sleeps calm upon the grass And shadows flings from bush and tree Sweet Mary dear my bonny lass, How much my fancy dwells on thee I look upon thy breasts so white And think my love is there enshrined I kiss them by the pale moon light And love thee stronger in my mind Mary I loved through good and ill And till death parts us love thee still STANZAS To Adelaide 1 Adelaide beautiful Adelaide see The spring is returning to beauty and thee The snowdrops are breaking the soil and appear As white as thy neck at the spring of the year Adelaide beautiful Adelaide here The primroses come and tis spring of the year 2 The primroses come and the birds mate in pairs O when will my life be as happy as theirs O when shall I woo thee and sit in the shade Mong violets and primroses my sweet Adelaide When in those bright eyes will those baby's appear That I saw when I kissed thee last spring of the year O Adelaide beautiful Adelaide hear The snow drops have brought thee the spring of the year 3 The aconites open like rays of the sun And tell thee the pleasures of spring is begun Then Adelaide beautiful Adelaide hear Let us take lovers walks at the spring of the year THE BEAN FIELD A Bean field full in blossom smells as sweet As Araby or Groves of orange flowers Black eyed and white and feathered to ones feet How sweet they smell in mornings dewy hours When seething night is left upon the flowers And when morns bright sun shines oer the field The pea bloom glitters in the gems o' showers And sweet the fragrance which the union yields To battered footpaths crossing o'er the fields. STANZAS [There is a land of endless joy] 1 There is a land of endless joy And everlasting bliss I knew it when I was a boy Twas somewhere upon this I knew that green and happy place A land unknown to sin Joy beamed in every happy face For they were all our kin 2 Jews christian turks and gentle kind Possest that place above Redeemed by Gods unbiased mind And everlasting love Some tuned their harps some sung their songs Angelic women there In infant worship all day long Was fairest of the fair 3 They told me God the land possesed The bushes trees and flowers That every soul there on was blest And all its joy was ours That God they hummed there spirits joy Was both the king and prince I saw it when a little boy But never found it since LOVE 1 Life without the fear of death Or dread of Lightening from above No graves or any loss of breath Is love 2 Truth without deception this A joy ensured above God is the author and the bliss True love 3 Twas matchless Eve in paradise With beauty from above That gave to Man without earth's vice Her love 4 Adah &amp; Zillah next in flower About their Adam move They slept beside him in the bower In love 5 Rachael &amp; Rebecca next The scripture came to prove Love was their God the Bible text Their love 6 Ruth and Nahoma eked the race Of Adams hopes above The first man shared their childrens grace Their love 7 Kessia and Jemima too Jobs comforts from above Gives Adams heart like Hermans dew Their love 8 The Bibles race is heavens own Turks own their God above And Woman round Mahomets throne Is love 9 All of mankind are heavens race From Gods own power above And woman with Eves mother face Mans love SONG [The spring comes on daily] 1 The spring comes on daily The wood bank encloses Its blue violets gaily And brimstone primroses Veined Ivy leaves traces Green moss patches bring In woods and sweet places First sight o' the spring The milk maid each morning in cotton drab Gown As fresh as a Rose bears her milk to the Town 2 Spring is the happiest Season of love The grass is the nappiest And greenest above Blue skys are the clearest And heaven more high Woods and ridings are dearest When Adelaide's nigh A cropping new primroses walking along And hearing with pleasure the milking maids song 3 How bright peep the primroses How sweet violets smell In the narrow green closes And briar tangl'ed dell The larks o'er the stubble shock Singing full high The Guns on the double cock Watching hares running bye One starts the Guns crack and wizzes a smoak It falls and cries ‘auntie’ beneath the lopped oak SONG [Sweet is the violet scented pea] 1 Sweet is the violet scented pea Haunted by red legged sable bee But sweeter far than all to me Is her I love so dearly Than perfumed pea or sable bee The face I love so dearly 2 Sweet as the hedge row violet blue Than apple blossoms streaky hue The black eyed bean flower bleb'd with dew Is her I love so dearly Than apple flowers or violets blue The cheeks I love so dearly 3 Than woodbines upon branches thin The clover flower all sweets within Which pensive bees do gather in Three times as sweet or nearly Is the cheek the lip the eye the chin Of her I love so dearly TRUE LOVE 1 The inward tear the silent sigh The look spoke loud in beauties eye Strikes like Thor's hammer i' the shock Though marble bosoms only mock 2 If hidden tears and unheard sighs Speak nothing—there no heart replies If signs like these are passed unknown Then love with two was never known 3 The maid that love in secret keeps The eye that in the bosom weeps The cheek that burns up fire to see Her speak to others though it bee 4 Cold sweats that chill the brow of toil To see her on another smile Is love that boils through every vein But owns no voices to explain 5 A hidden mystery of the breast A heart that sleeps without its rest A word that's ever on the tongue And keeps it silent all day long 6 A wish that aches to have its way Yet keeps it prisoner day by day A thought for one and one alone That petrifies the heart to stone 7 Love flashes in the human eye And beatings of the heart reply Love tingles in the virgin blood Of woman in her maidenhood 8 For man those snowy hills do swell For man those smiles do secrets tell For man sweet womans love was born Then who would beauties glances scorn SONG [Will Jockey cum to day mither] 1 Will Jockey cum to day

wind my love Over the green silk grass Heaves in the leafing trees above And fans the milking lass The ribbons on her bonnet poke Flutter like startled birds Plays in her curls, and almost spoke Like lovers wispered words She turns around but none is nigh Save plovers in a cloudy sky 2 How beautiful her drapery swims As down the path she goes How lovely shade her well turn'd limbs Through her wind folding clothes It bows in every silken flower And trembles in the grass At morning and at evening hour Where goes the Milking lass It flutters in her folding gown And sings spring music to the town 3 The April wind is soft and sweet Flying o'er meadows—kissing flowers Flirting round maidens slippered feet Before it drops in sprinkling showers A playful thing the April wind That dances through the silken grass And flutters in her gown behind As singing goes the milking lass O'er closes green—o'er fallows brown Then bears her milk-pails to the town ‘THE WILLOW SHADED LANE’ 1 ‘The willow shaded Lane’ The spots where lovers stray I long to see those scenes again In this sweet month of May I long to take her well turn'd arm At dewy close of day And walk the road beside the farm Along with

my bonny lass And love thee Susan Grey 3 When the lark is on her eggs In the flaggy wheat Brightly shines the water skeggs And the hare is on her seat The stars look bright again Bright glows the milky way And down the willow shaded lane I'll walk wi' Susan Grey 4 Around her bonny breast I'll cling And gaze upon her face And muse upon that beautious thing In that green and lovely place How beautiful her drapery swims Beneath the moonlight ray To her my memory fondly clings And I love Susan Grey [Thou maiden Flower o' Scotish land] 1 Thou maiden Flower o' Scotish land We'll seek the rose

o' Gear I ever bear her winter frown And am poor from year to year My pockets pennyless remain In sunshine and in shades Muses my requests disdain Are naught but flirting jades I'm scant o' grace and scant o' gear And pennyless for a' the year 2 Misfortune is a flirting jade Her face a bump o' sin Of priest-craft-cant she makes a trade And takes the simple in She makes the rich oppress the poor The poor she keeps as slaves The pulpet stands at hells hot door She reads them in their graves I've stood her gab the whole year round And now I'm all but underground 3 Sae' black misfortune hauds me

cheese 4 Give me the poor mans lot His toil in woods to hack A corner in his cot With a garden at the back Where Bears-breach powdered flowers Amuse his leisure hours 5 A string pulls up the latch There's his flagging bottom chair And the martin neath the thatch Hangs her mortar dwelling there Give me a cottage to my mind And I a peaceful home shall find [Will ye gang wi' me to Scotland dear] 1 Will ye gang wi' me to Scotland dear Where the mountains touch the sky And leave your humdrum labours here And climb the hills sa'e high Come leave your fowl your pigs and kye And your mud-floor dwelling here Come put your wheel and knitting bye We'll be off to Scotland dear For the summer lark is in the sky 2 The daisys gold in silver rim Is blazing on the mountain side And the skylarks wing

me to Scotland dear Where the crimpled brackens grow Where the rose blooms on the mountain brere As white as driven snow Then in the green bloom of the year With me to Scotland go SPRING WIND 1 The wind blows the trees about In the green field The wind blows the bees about Which bushes shield 'Tis the green wind of May time That suddenly wakes That starts in the day time When every thing shakes The trees and the bushes, the grasses and grain Like the waves of the ocean roll over the plain 2 The wind what can beat it So frolic and playful The beast cannot eat it Though it fills all the day full 'Tis the grass in the meadow All tossing in billows The wheat where streams glidder Waving under the willows Now the trees in the hedges are heaving like hair And bushes are shaking like living things there 3 The water all curdles Like wrinkles in ice Like ribbed floating hurdles That look rather nice It swabbs the bullrushes The flags it swirls through By the ozier bed pushes Where the white lilies grew Whose broad leaves are wet with the plash o' the wave Where the froth binds the bullrush like snow on the grave 4 It blows in my face now Though I do'nt see it pass It breathes on the flowers now Now billows the grass It sweeps the grey willows Like the roof of a house Swirls the sedges i' billows O'er the nest o' the mouse Flys Bees and crickets are singing all day And winds mooving every green thing in its way [I sigh with the wind like a storm stricken tree] 1 I sigh with the wind like a storm stricken tree And could weep with the morning but find not a tear For love is inconstant like the ebb o' the sea And all things are false which I look on or hear Love seeks its own bosom from falshood and lies And lives in itself turning bitter to sweet It dreams of a smile from its own favour'd eyes And deceives its own heart from passions high heat 2 I sigh with the wind and I moan with the trees But the dew drops of tears are passions own flame But Love will bloom fair after number of years As it blossomed in Paradise—still its the same. And so it will be Love, with you Love &amp; me Love Kept green in the soul to the end of the earth 'Twas so in thy infancy—so Let it be love Love owns one Creator and no second birth 3 'Tis a child of the Soul—not a thing of the clay 'Tis a tennant for heaven that never can die 'Tis a vision of joy that will ne'er pass away So long as the sun lives the light of the sky— For the Soul of earths nature is her clothing of green And love in her essence is Heavens own light And both are in Eden with Love all unseen Where God is its being eternal and bright [Her eyes are bright as the stars by night] 1 Her eyes are bright as the stars by night And her lips like twin cherries red Her cheeks are the rose when in dew it first blows And her breasts like twin lillies in bed. As sweet my young Love As the pink or the clove Or the streaky gilly-flower Her breasts are as white As heavens own light— —And she grows to her bridal hour 2 Her eyes own light are diamonds bright That looks upon Love as the sun As dews on the flower in mornings shower So her smiles revive when they're won She's the spring of the year And the brook so clear And the primrose in bloom by its side That looks to the sky with innocent eye And the charm of the spring in its pride 3 The linnets nest so softly prest Clings on the white thorn tree To harm it where a sin the little ones within Are so happy in their home so free &amp; it were sin to wrong The maid in a Song With feelings insincere So I'll keep her like a Dove In a happy thought o' Love &amp; think of her all the long year [My love is fair and bonny] 1 My love is fair and bonny Red flowers are in her gown 'Tis fine and bright as ony And a comb is in her crown A comb o' Tortoieshell Her hair is brown and long Its lapped up choice and well And plaited in a thong Her neck is white and fair And dark brown is her hair 2 She's like a bunch of lilies There's a mole upon her breast And a bed of daffodilly's Is not more richly dresst A sattin gown on Sunday's The like on't ne'er were seen And a cotton gown on Monday's With sprigs of bonny green Her form is fine and fine her clothes is Her cheeks a bunch of province roses 3 I love my love with silent love The secreter the dearer Her choicest place is heaven above And there I shall be near her I'll love her in those scenes of bliss As Eve &amp; Adam's daughter For there Love lives in spite of this Like streams of living water And there I'll wait my love to seek In sundays sattins all the week [Honey words make charms of blisses] 1 Honey words make charms of blisses Which fondness keeps together And these when ripe will melt in kisses The dews of summer weather The clouds will lay their heads on earth To kiss it every morning When showers of dew pearls have their birth The woods and fields adorning 2 The busy bee will kiss the flower As often as he pleases The butterfly in sunny hour Will kiss but never teazes The skylark mounts to kiss the sun That o'er the green corn glitters Then like a stone he drops when done And in the meadow twitters 3 The twilight kisses mornings blush In coal black night's retreating And midday breezes kiss the bush Its pleasant shadows meeting Grass, corn and leaves in windy days Are stirred in mighty putther The flowers are ravished by the bees The rest kiss one another 4 But Mary fairest of thy kind No woman ne'er was fairer Nature's a puzzle to my mind A flirt I cannot bear her For me and love she only cheats Days sunshine and eve's dew She kisses everything she meets And I've not once kissed you [There is a charm in Solitude that cheers] There is a charm in Solitude that cheers A feeling that the world knows nothing of A green delight the wounded mind endears After the hustling world is broken off Whose whole delight was crime at good to scoff Green solitude his prison pleasure yields The bitch fox heeds him not—birds seem to laugh He lives the Crusoe of his lonely fields Which dark green oaks his noontide leisure shields [O the world keeps running round] 1 O the world keeps running round With contrariness to me There's falshood in the sound Of all I hear and see My love she's not so pretty As many others be Nor talkative nor witty Yet very dear to me 2 In the yellow gorse I see her But that's wi' fancys eye For I'm longing to be wi' her While in prison bonds I lie Furse bushes like to gilleflowers More yellow are than gold I've loved her there in summer hours With joyfulness untold 3 The furze bush is a prickly tree Those flowers attract the bees But false love's often wounded me With sharper thorns than these I met my love upon the heath In summer's pleasant hours She wore no thorns to be my death She brought me nought but flowers 4 And she shall be my only love No other I'll prefer For by that sun that shines above I'll love but only her We'll walk the molehill banks between Where wild thyme smells so sweet And at the dewy close o' e'en I there my love shall meet [There's music in the songs of birds] 1 There's music in the songs of birds There's music in the bee There's music in a womans voice When sitting on your knee While walking in the mossy vales Beneath the spreading beech Song lives in singing nightingales And in a womans speech 2 To hear her wisper in the dark 'Tis heavens melody Her calm reply her wise remark Is more than song to me The harp can touch no sweeter chord In music's thrilling choice Nor music breath[e] a sweeter word Than comes from womans voice 3 There's music in the singing lark That carols to the sky To hear her wisper in the dark 'Tis heavens melody There's music in a womans voice While sitting on your knee And Emma is my own heart's choice When e'er she chooses me THE SHEPHERD BOY 1 The fly or beetle on their track Are things that know no sin And when they whemble on their back What terror they seem in The shepherd boy wi' bits o' bents Will turn them up again And start them where they nimbly went Along the grassy plain And such the shepherd boy is found While lying on the sun crackt ground 2 The lady-bird that seldom stops From climbing all the day Climbs up the rushes tassle tops Spreads wings and flies away He sees them—lying on the grass Musing the whole day long And clears the way to let them pass And sings a nameless song He watches pismires on the hill Always busy never still 3 He sees the traveller beetle run Where thick the grass wood weaves To hide the black-snail from the sun He props up plantain leaves The lady-cows have got a house Within the cowslip pip The spider weaving for his spouse On threads will often slip So looks and lyes the shepherd boy The summer long his whole employ— [Swift goes the sooty swallow o'er the heath] Swift goes the sooty swallow o'er the heath Swifter then skims the cloud rack of the skies As swiftly flies its shadow underneath And on his wing the twittering sunbeam lies As bright as water glitters in the eyes Of those it passes—'tis a pretty thing The ornament of meadows—and clear skies With dingy breast and narrow pointed wing Its daily twittering is a song to spring. [The spring comes cheery o'er the Scottish mountains] 1 The spring comes cheery o'er the Scottish mountains Over the valley and brae O the spring comes cheery Bright shines the sun o'er the gravel paved fountains That ripples down mountains sides ne'er seeming weary Sweet comes the spring cloathing hills wi' green brackan Sweet the gold sunshine gilds Scotland a' over Sweet are the songs which the goudspink are making Which I hear as I go o'er the hills to my lover 2 Bonny Scotch lassie love how shall I woo thee To clasp thy sweet waist, call thee more than my ain The look o' thy eye is the light that gaes through me And leaves heart and soul i' the spirit o' pain But the smile of thy red lip my ain bonny lassie Cures pain the severest o' body and mind We've roamed up the mountain side by the stream's glassy The pleasures o' love in green places to find 3 And pleasure I felt i the charms o' my dearie While we closely embraced in that green pleasant place She blushed like briers bloom but luiked her sen cheery And her white lily bosom presst close to my face Do I love thee my Mary thou pink o' creation She wispered ‘you do’ and she kissed as she spoke I courted and gave her no sort o' vexation And we'll soon be none ither than plain married folk MARGARET 1 The sunday was warm and the blue and brown skippers Where jumping and dancing along the gold broom A ganging to Church in sweet shining slippers I saw bonny Margarette just in her bloom Her gown was the tartan red checked wi' blue Her bonnet was straw platted sae small Her bosom was beating so goodly and true Her face the red rose—mine white as the wall 2 I wanted to tempt her away from Church books And steal from the Church down the valley to stray And sit down and court her in sweet pleasant nooks But she never heard—or had nothing to say So I kept in her company to the church door And went in to preaching, and sat by her side I gazed on her tartan but did nothing moor Than two or three wishes she might be my bride 3 I left the Church seat with my hat in my hand And kept by her side all the length of the way I pressed that she would my best thoughts understand So we took a new path in the valley to stray Her young maiden innocence and beauty beside Made me love her so dearly on those sabath hours That a few weeks of courtship has made her my bride And she loves me the dearest of wild forest flowers [The rauk o' the hills &amp; the mist o' the mountains] 1 The rauk o' the hills &amp; the mist o' the mountains Like the reek o' a pot and the smoke o' a kill Draws further off still while the round sun is counting His pulses o' light i' the morning sae still Saftly and chill comes the breeze o' the ocean Saft fans the brackin alang the hill side The vale o' green broom-twigs are a' easy motion Like a green sea o' waters wi' waves rolling wide 2 O maid o' the mountain here's scenes that would please ye Would ye climb but as high at the break o' the day Walk wi' me o'er their taps love and make your life easy And look o'er the ocean mist mealy and grey Life and its cares will be under our feet love Like a hawk that is cheated or a foe led astray We can look on sweet nature in cold or in heat love Unseen on the mountain tops a' the lang day 3 There's the clumps o' rest harrow luv' purple and yellow There's the bushes o' sweet-briar luscious and sweet There's the swallow that twitters and fallows his fellow Like birds o' the ither world under our feet Come to the mountain tops soon after day break Where toads canna' climb and birds seldom fly There's a place i' the rock where a biggin we make And true love will welcome thy presence with joy THE PANSEY 1 O how cruel is the fuel That would give the heart unrest Murder feelings sweet revealings Planting daggers in the breast Tricolored Pansies lovers fancies How they shine in their bright hue Shining Beaux in courting cloaths Happy all the sunday through 2 Love may languish in its anguish Pansies they are happy beaux Sun or rain they feel no pain Ever in their sunday cloaths Blue and yellow not their fellow With them in the garden grows The sunshine rays sets them a blaze Pansies Summers happy beaux 3 O how cruel is the fuel That would give the heart unrest Murder feelings sweet revealings Planting daggers i' the breast Tricoloured Pansies Lovers fancies How they blaze wi' spangled wing Shining beaux in courting cloaths Brightest flowers of all the Spring 4 Tricoloured Pansies Lovers fancies Bright and beautiful ye are Blue and yellow not your fellow In the garden looks so fair Yellow Blue if love be true ‘God is Love’ to prove it is Cropt with Posies—Pinks and roses Pretty Maidens crop you this SONG [The hurly burly wind] 1 The hurly burly wind And it whirls the wheat about While its comeing in the ear And the barley's on the sprout It whirls the wheat about me In its suit of sunny green And my lassie need not doubt me She's the sweetest ever seen 2 Her hair is of the auburn And her cheek is of the rose And my bonny Sarah Ann is The sweetest flower that grows Her lips are like the cherry And her skin is lilly white Her tongue is ever merry Her smiles are all delight 3 The hurly-burly wind And it whirls the wheat about The billows swab behind And the headaches scrail without The bluecaps in the green Eddie like Butterflies And nothing still is seen Where e'er we turn our eyes 4 My love is like the wild scene Her gown is floating free And I have like a child been To seek her company And I must like a child be In fancy's to delight So I walk to see the wild bee And butterfly till night [When Jenny was here I was seldom alone] 1 When Jenny was here I was seldom alone Her hand went in mine and her arm on my own Then her beautiful arm in its green cotton sleave Was pressed to my side and you cannot beleive What pleasure I felt—and what pleasure I feel In thinking on't now though I vainly conceal My passion pretending I'm talking to flowers I'm talking to Jane in her innocent hours 2 I loved her when here—in her abscence I love I'ts warm to my heart as the nest to the dove At the sunset of even' she'd linger and stay To see it go down till the night grizzled grey I think of those kisses when trees left their green And feel every wisper we uttered unseen Where I stole the last kiss—here's the white thorn &amp; breer Though Jenny's long absent the stile is still here 3 I never half told her beneath the green bough The pleasant love tales as I'm telling of now I always court better when left to my sell Sometimes beside her I nothing could tell I could preach like loves sermon book wandering alone When the woods look'd so green and I felt her my own O how I could court her 'neath this setting sun And succeed all the better than e'er I had done 4 When Jenny was with me how bleated the sheep While neath a wild rose bush we both fell asleep I cropt her a rose in that innocent hour While a bee stung her face that concealed in the flower I loved her, and hugged her, and kissed the place well And the wind sings the story in that mossy dell Last Michaelmas Jenny was close to my call —Now abscent what dreariness hangs over all SONG [O Elenor! O Elenor] 1 O Elenor! O Elenor As sweet as any rose Thy cherry lip I would prefer To any flower that blows I long to kiss thee Elenor That bonny cheek of thine Thy cherry lip I do prefer To all things but divine Divinest flower save those above thee I choose thee bonny maid and love thee 2 I choose thee as a maiden fair And sweetest of thy kind Thy rosey cheeks thy dark brown hair And thy good tempered mind O Elenor O Elenor Some mercy on me show Thy cherry lip I would prefer To all the flowers that blow Before thee love I none prefer My fairest only Elenor 3 My Elenor My Elenor I love thy face the best Love to thy dress clings like a bur That on thy heart could rest Of all the blooms of all the trees Thou art the choicest flower Without thy smiles I only freeze Without one welcome hour But in thy love I'm ever cheery Then come and give me welcome deary SONG [The hay was mown and grounds were cleared] 1 The hay was mown and grounds were cleared And flags were green each side the streams On white thorn bush bell flowers appeared As white as lillies are in dreams While I was walking by the streams With love and health in eather eye With cheeks as rosey as sunbeams A country maiden passed me by 2 The hedge rose showed her bonny cheek The bell flowers hue her lily skin My fancy eyed her one whole week And much I tried the maid to win I wooed her in the morning beams Beside green flags and rustling reeds She plucked a bent beside the streams And bowed her head to count the seeds 3 Then plucked a dog rose from the brere The palest on the bush got she She got it for her lover dear For then she had his company I eyed the maid from top to toe It was the same the very same I started in my dream to know And try to recollect her name SONG [In the meadows silk grasses we see the black snail] 1 In the meadows silk grasses we see the black snail Creaping out at the close of the eve sipping dew While even's one star glitters over the vale Like a lamp hung outside of that of blue I walk with my truelove adown the green vale The light feathered grasses keep tapping her shoe In the white thorn the nightingale sings her sweet tale And the blades of the grass are sprinkled with dew 2 If she stumbles I catch her and cling to her neck As the meadow-sweet kisses the blush of the rose Her wisper none hears and the kisses I take The mild hues of Even' will never disclose Her hair hung in ringlets adown her sweet cheek That blushed like the brier in the hedge hung with dew Her wisper was fragrance her face was so meek The dove was the type on't that from the bush flew SPRING 1 Come gentle Spring and show thy varied greens In woods and fields and meadows by clear brooks Come Gentle Spring and bring thy sweetest scenes Where Peace and solitude the loveliest looks Where the blue unclouded sky Spreads the sweetest canopy And study wiser grows without her books 2 Come hither gentle May and with thee bring Flowers of all colours and the wild briar rose Come in wind floating drapery and bring Fragrance and bloom that natures love bestows Meadow pinks and columbines Keksies white and Eglantines And music of the Bee that seeks the rose 3 Come gentle Spring and bring thy choicest looks Thy bosom graced with flowers thy face with smiles Come gentle Spring and trace thy wandering brooks O'er meadow gates and footpath crooked stiles Come in thy proud and best array April dews and first of May And singing birds that come where heaven smiles CLOCK A CLAY 1 In the cowslips peeps I lye Hidden from the buzzing fly While green grass beneath me lies Pearled wi' dew like fishes eyes Here I lye a Clock a clay Waiting for the time o' day 2 While grassy forests quake surprise And the wild wind sobs and sighs My gold home rocks as like to fall On its pillars green and tall When the pattering rain drives bye Clock a Clay keeps warm and dry 3 Day by day and night by night All the week I hide from sight In the cowslips peeps I lye In rain and dew still warm and dry Day and night and night and day Red black spotted clock a clay 4 My home it shakes in wind and showers Pale green pillar top't wi' flowers Bending at the wild winds breath Till I touch the grass beneath Here still I live lone clock a clay Watching for the time of day SONG [Come weal come woe I care not] 1 Come weal come woe I care not Nor fear it not a fly Though others ills I bear not They often make me sigh I'm poor, but not in natures choice Her laws I always own I hear her as a mothers voice And never feel alone Come weal come woe I never care The ills of life I gladly bear. 2 The spring has clad the land in green The daisey opens on the lea A golden stud in silver sheen And spreads her choicest gifts for me I scent the violets breath perfume Beneath the white-thorn leafing shade I see and bend me o'er their bloom And think upon the lovely maid Come weal come woe I never care The ills o' life I gladly bear. 3 The knotting bloom is on the thorn The little bird is on its nest And I've been happy all the morn Leaning on my true loves breast A breast as white as any curd And soft as any pillows are With voice o' music like the bird And fair, o' she was more than fair Come weal come woe I never care The ills of life I gladly bear. [The Spring comes clad in green] 1 The Spring comes clad in green And the birds begin to sing And the Lovers steps have been Where the primroses spring Where the violets spread perfume There the Lovers heedless stray Where the blue-bell hides its bloom In the merry month of May Come sweet Phebe to the green wood shade Where thou in childhood gathered flowers and played. 2 The Spring comes gladsome green The flower's come bright and blue In meads and woodland shene And Mary comes as true There's the spinneys bright blue bells Phebe's eyes are brown and true Theres perfume in the cells And the woods divinely blue The Muse and music of my song Is Phebe do not keep me long. 3 I know the secret place for thee The ivy oak the primrose nook I know the leaving knotty tree The blue-bell bright—and brawling brook Come my Phebe young and kind To the green wood quickly come Hear the murmurs of the wind Seek the primrose sulphur bloom Sweet faced Phebe hither stray And be my lover all the day. THE WIND 1 The frolicksome wind through the trees and the bushes Keeps sueing and sobbing and waiving all day Frighting magpies from trees and from white thorns the thrushes And waveing the river in wrinkles and spray The unresting wind is a frolicksome thing O'er hedges in floods and green fields of the spring 2 It plays in the smoke of the chimney at morn Curling this way and that i' the morns dewy light It curls from the twitch heap among the green corn Like the smoke from the cannon i'th' midst of a fight But report there is none to create any alarm From the smoke an old ground full hiding meadow &amp; farm 3 How sweet curls the smoke oer the green o' the field How majestic it rolls o'er the face o' the grass And from the low cottage the elm timbers shield In the calm o' the evening how sweet the curls pass I' the sunset how sweet to behold the cot smoke From the low red brick chimney beneath the dark oak 4 How sweet the wind wispers o' midsummers eves And fans the winged elder leaves o'er the old pales While the cottage smoke o'er them a bright pillar leaves Rising up and turns clouds by the strength of the gales O' sweet is the cot neath its colums of smoke While dewy eve brings home the labouring folk SONG [On a bonny April morning] 1 On a bonny April morning By the grey and green wood side Where the blue-bells were adorning There a pretty girl I spied Her hair was brown and curling Her eyes were bright and blue Where the mossy brook was purling O I loved the maiden true 2 I loved her fond and tender Aye tenderly and true So heavens love defend her A rose half blown i' dew A blue-bell in the white thorn green A violet in the shade The sweetest flower I'd ever seen Was that all beauteous maid 3 Her face was young and pretty And sweetly she could sing And her bright eye drop't pity At every cruel thing The place was full of blue bells Where that pretty girl I spied A heaven in the green dells Hid in this world so wide SONG [On mossy banks the violets blue] 1 On mossy banks the violets blue Sweet smells in white thorn bushes All beaded wi' the morning dew Beneath the nests o' thrushes I love the sunny sweet spring morn Wheat lands and grounds of clover I love the fields of sprouting corn To look at or walk over One only care remains with me To sigh for one I cannot see 2 And when I see a pleasant place I think how lovely she'd be there And when I see an angel face Theres something-nothing nigh so fair I see the white thorn knot for may The primrose at its mossy root I hear green linnets on the sprey Singing when all the rest are mute But one I love I cannot see That in such scenes were all to me 3 On mole hill turf by ivied woods I love to see the springs may dew Primrosey brooks their crimpled floods That far into the woods we view I love to see the half formed nest The blackbird lining hers wi' grass The cock-bird with his sooty breast Singing bye water clear as glass I love such scenes and there I'm free To think of one I cannot see 4 In every green and pleasant place I think of one I may not see The rosey blooms upon her face Her eye beams happiness on me The rushy green the primrose spring The awthorn hedge the grassy baulk Where wheatlands in dark places spring And larks and linnets almost talk They sing of her I may not see And there I love their melody SWEET SPRING 1 The spring it beams sweet on the green linnets wing The wind ruffles soft on the ring-doves coy breast And heedless the wild bees on spring blossoms hing Sweed about by the wind as an unbidden guest O I love the soft gush of the winds in the spring And chaffinch in thorn hedges trying to sing 2 I love the sweet spring i' the flowers o' the larch Cones o' purple rich studding the starry leaves green They got through the storms and the blusters o' March And mix with the things that are fair to be seen I love all the buds and the blossoms that Spring O'er the earth in her leisure is welcome to bring 3 I love the sweet Spring in its comeing at first Flowering moss on the wall—swelling bud on the bush I love the sweet flowers when they come one and all First note of the c[h]affinch, first song of the thrush I love the first sights o' the Spring as they come The green o' the grass and the daisey in bloom 4 The sunbeams that close to the hedges approach Paints the sulphur hued primrose deliciously pale And pilewort that shines like gold on a broach And clusters o' violets scenting the gale I love the first sight o' the Spring's bonny green Where the lass she goes milking the cows i' the e'en SONG [Come we to the Summer, to the Summer we will come] 1 Come we to the Summer, to the Summer we will come For the woods are full of blue-bells and the hedges full of bloom And the crow is on the oak a building of her nest And love is burning diamonds in my true lovers breast She sits beneath the white thorn a plaiting of her hair And I will to my true love with a fond request repair I will look upon her face, I will in her beauty rest And lay my acheing weariness upon her lovely breast. 2 The clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom o' May The merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day And the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest In the white thorn bush where I will lean upon my lovers breast I'll lean upon her breast and I'll wisper in her ear That I cannot get a wink o' sleep for thinking of my dear I hunger at my meat and I daily fade away Like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day. 3 Among the white-thorn bushes at the edge of the green My Love is doing net work and is lovely to be seen No cap or bonnet on her hair her comb with pearls inlaid They shine like diamond drops o' dew upon the lovely maid Her gown is silk or sattin—its colours red &amp; blue And her heart beats neath the gloss on't like a pendalum so true I'll go and clasp a armfull about her bonny breast And kiss, and ne'er disturb the chaffinch on its nest. MY LOVE 1 My Love is like a pleasant thought A first flower of the May My Love she is a charm unbought Young, beautiful and gay My Love she is a dream of joy More living than a dream A sweetness nothing would destroy The sunlight i' the stream My Love is all and more than these A pleasant thought that's born to please 2 Than summer flowers her face more sweet Than morning dews her eye more clear Here hedge-rose and wild woodbines meet In them I pay her worship here Wild woodbines streaky hues o' red Hedge-roses blushing fleshy hue Carnations glowing in their bed My Love's as fair and sweet and true My Love's a thought of more than these To charm in secret witcheries 3 Sweet pleasant thoughts and happy dreams My lovers more o' womans kin She's even sweeter than she seems And o' her heart is warm within Warm as the smile upon her lip Warm as the turtle in its nest As nectar which the wild bees sip As moles upon her bonny breast Sweeter than all these visions prove Is her I worship in first Love I LOVE THEE 1 I know that I love thee I feel it all o'er me If wrong, God reprove me So much to adore thee I know not the reason, but only I love thee Around thee, about thee, below and above me I know that I love and adore thee and now The soul of my worship's none other than thou I feel so and know it There's none other before thee These verses they show it That I love and adore thee 2 Thy skin is the marble All snowy and white Thy voice is the warble Of the song bird of night I love thee I feel without knowing the reason Thy blooms like the lily's this beautiful season Thy face is all beauty thy form I adore I love thee—no language could ever say more 'Tis thee I would walk with And leave thee O never 'Tis thee I would talk with And love thee for ever BALLAD 1 One summer's sunday morning Just by the break o' day Dew-drops the grass adorning Shone on the meadow way I took my mornings rambles Right early i' the morn Down the hedge row hung wi' brambles And o'er fields o' standing corn 2 And there I saw a bonny lass A comeing from the town And tripping o'er the moist green grass Bedecked in sunday gown Why in such haste my bonny lass And early in the day At yonder town kind sir she said I'm going to spend the day 3 The bee was on the buttercup Still clinging fast asleep The grasshopper awake and up Was springing in a leap Sweet linnets they were in the bush The lark was in the cloud And gently waved the bright bullrush Where the lock-pens roared aloud 4 She left the path to let me pass —For reasons just the same I turned aside among the grass My face burnt like to shame The village spire was plainly seen Some poplar trees behind The awthorn bush was more then green That wavered to the wind 5 We went by sheep and grazing stock And then we crossed the corn The gilt hands on the old church clock Was six that sunny morn I'd gone too far to wander back By meadow field and grove Her tongue was loosed to pleasant clack And mine was still with love 6 From the brown land the sooty crow Flew up and gave a quark Magpies from white thorn bush did go And noised as they would talk. I stooped down to tie her shoe And knock her pattens too 'Twas just the pleasant way to woo What honest love should do 7 She went to see her friends that day Her mother at the door Good byed her out o' sight the way Till we were seen no more She took my arm—I little knew What in her bright eye shone We went the way and passed for two And both returned as one— SONG [I went my Sunday mornings rounds] 1 I went my Sunday mornings rounds One pleasant summer day And stood i' the green meadow grounds 'Mong cocks and swaths o' hay Up the green rush the Lady bird Clomb to its very tops And there the crickets songs were heard Like organs without stops 2 The sun was climbing up the sky A looking glass of gold It melts and quivers on the eye And blinds us to behold Melting and shining to its height It shines from pole to pole And sliddering down at dewy night Goes out a dying coal 3 I stood among the swathes and cocks How sweet the light did seem When a sweet lass with inky locks Came tripping by the stream Sweet one I said I do prefer To ask you why you walk 'Tis merely for my pleasure sir As you stand there to talk 4 The wind came from the southern sky And tokened flying showers The busy bee and butterfly Her ribbons took for flowers The wasp it buzzed about her mouth Her lips seemed cherries red The wind shook from the balmy south The curls about her head 5 Young man she said you'l marry me And waited for reply Why yes my dear but do'nt you see Love is the stronger tie And then I kissed her lips and cheeks And made her merry hearted I wed the maid in just three weeks From the first day we parted THE PINK OF OUR TOWN 1 I've seen the summer morning With its jewels and its gems The may the thorn adorning Like snow upon their stems The primrose in the green wood The violet in the shade Every sweet wild flower and green bud But none beats my peerless maid She's handsomer and fairer Than flowers of hill and down My Mary still is rarer She's the pink of our town 2 Than Mary none's so bonny Than Mary none's so fair She's the sweetest face of ony And beautiful's her hair Her bosom's like a pillow Her waist is but a span She'll never wear the willow Wi' likeing of a man No wild flower e're was fairer Search wood and hill and down Mary's a flower still rarer She's the pink of our town 3 O Mary lovely Mary Since the first hour we met My rest has been contrary I cannot thee forget I'll love thee and forever We never can be parted As flows the undrying river True love is ne'er deserted Mary's the fairest, sweetest I've searched the hill and down Of flowers she is the neetest And the pink of our town JERUSALEM 1 And is she now fallen That city of souls The land with Gods call on —Like the planet that rolls The land that God quickened Is perished and dead Her people they sickened Her Alters are fled 2 Her alters are perished No holy hope gives While the heathen are cherished And their baal still lives Gods chosen scorns fingers Points low in the dust A remnant still lingers In iron and rust 3 The Agag's around them Have cut them away And the heathens confine them To dungeons a prey The city of David The land of the Lord Like heathens depraved All fell by the sword 4 O Lord God Almighty Our fallen state see The queen of the city Is weeping for thee Thy temple is fallen Thy city is gone And the daughters are calling To thee when alone 5 Our Mothers are widdows Our alters o'erthrown And the Agag's forbid us To put up a stone Lord heed us and hear us Though fallen we're men We'll see Agag fear us And our temple agen 6 Our prayer never ceases By day or by night They're all ‘cut in pieces’ Who question thy might Our speach shall not falter On mountain or glen Lord build thy own alter Of our city agen [Take back the rose nor let it wither] 1 Take back the rose nor let it wither On heart so cold as mine Yet once my love when seen together Both would have been divine But since my hopes are crushed &amp; blighted I've little love for flowers My love for thee shall be requited In warmer climes than ours When hearts shall join and be united In stronger types than flowers 2 The fairest flower but blooms to wither The sweetest summers fly But two fond hearts when joined together In true love—never die The rose it is the summers flower It blooms in Lapland too And comes to me in sorrows hour Though given love by you It comes to me without the power To feel it or be true 3 I cannot bear to crop a flower And see it die away The rose perfumes the summer hour Too lovely to decay I'd rather chuse one on the tree To bloom my summer guest Than let one fade and die from thee On my abandoned breast If love this fairy gift may be This love song speaks the rest Augst 26th/48 THE MILKMAID 1 The months have nearly traveled round And wound the bottom of the year All splashy is the greensward ground Half full the waggon ruts appear The maple green to pale gold turns The hazel leaves blood red The ring-dove on the odd oak mourns As if his mate where dead 2 The pretty milkmaid picks her way O'er fields and closes many a one Sweet as the hedge rose on the spray Where all the rest are shook and gone By the round stack she milks her cows Beside the broad ash pollard tree Leaves drop off yellow i' the sloughs And weary drones the last odd bee 3 Sweet smells the fallen leaves and grass The fairy rings o' darker hue Sweet is the song of milking lass In field and close she wanders through The green woodpecker swoops and squeaks From one small hole in the ash tree Red is the ploughboys chubby cheeks —Wet stubbles rustle sweet to me 4 Red is the milkmaids elbows now And beautifully turned her arm Green o'er her head the oak tree bough Hums the wild winds music charm The milkmaid is a lovely thing Close to her bonnet swoop the crows She loves to see their sooty wing Their fanning wings at days bright close 5 The magpie broods have saucy tongues They rag her the two closes through The blackbird gives her sweeter songs Hedge sparrows they will charm her too— With sudden starts along the hedge Her shoes are sullied o'er with dew She walks beside the dykes o' sedge The sweetest rose that ever grew SONG [Maiden with that sunny brow] 1 Maiden with that sunny brow Smile my love and cheer me now For my heart is left alone And my life is chilled to stone Rose tinged cheek and breast of snow Hear me now before you go How doatingly I love you 2 By the sunbeams shed from high By the blue ethereal sky That blesses you where 'e'er you go And gives those eyes the brightest glow Ah hear the words I have to say Spoken on this summers day I only look to love thee 3 Maiden with that dark brown hair Cheeks rose tinged and bosom fair Red lips and nose so acquiline Dress so neat and shape divine Hear me as I bless thee so Hear my vows before I go How through my life I'll love thee 4 Sweet is the rose tinge steeped in dew Sweet is the evenings gold and blue Sweet flies the swallow o'er the plain Sweet smells the sweetbriar after rain Let me kiss before you go That cheek—and bosom like the snow I'll ever ever love thee WHAT IS LOVE 1 What is Love but pains disguise That dares not tell its secret pain That ever shrinks from hearts replies And tries to be himself again That shuns the crowd and noises rude That tries to keep his thoughts unknown And in the green of Solitude Keeps loves dear bondage all his own 2 There is but one in all the world Search earth or ocean clouds or air With rosey cheek and ringlets curled That seems to him so passing fair Grace in her motion—music speaks When e'er she talks or binds her hair The fairest rose blooms on her cheeks Her breasts the whitest lilies wear 3 The Poet is a silent thing A man in love none knoweth where He sees her in the boiling spring At even on the blooming brere He hears her in the songs of birds He sees her in the evening sky A shepherdess among the herds A milkmaid wi' the grazing kye THE GIPSEY LASS 1 Just like berry brown is my bonny lassie O And in the smokey camp lives my bonny lassie O Where the scented woodbine weaves Round the white thorns glossy leaves The sweetest maid on earth is my Gipsey lassie O 2 The brook it runs so clear by my bonny lassie O And the blackbird singeth near my bonny lassie O And there the wild briar rose Wrinkles the clear stream as it flows By the smokey camp of my bonny lassie O 3 The ground lark singeth high o'er my bonny lassie O The nightingale lives nigh my gipsey lassie O They're with her all the year By the brooks that run so clear And there's none in all the world like my gipsey lassie O 4 With a bosom like as snow is my Gipsey lassie O With a foot like the roe is my bonny lassie O Like the sweet birds she will sing While echo it will ring Sure there's none in the world like my bonny lassie O SCOTLAND 1 On the bleak hills o' Scotland my fancy reposes Where the thistle blooms fairer than lilies or roses The mountains o' mist and the dells o' brown bracken Are dear to my childhood that land o Gods makin' The scream o' the eagle, the loud water fall Is dear to my manhood in freedom and thrall Its tempests was music its cataracts joy The music of nature I loved as a boy 2 Proud land o cakes and free born mountaineers Wi' their blue thistle caps that scarce cover their ears Wi' their short tartan petticoats half down the thigh They're the bravest o' steel blades I ever came nigh The Bannockburn kittle blades dinna ye learn Ye'll never earn bread if the thistle ye spurn So here's a gude health to auld Scotlands red thistle Ane he that winna drink that may gae whistle 3 Auld Scotland the land o' the thistle and brave The refuge for freedom her birth-place and grave But we'll stick to her thistle and ever contrive To give mountain welcome and keep her alive The white mountain rose in her cap it will bloom And give us Scotch welcome wherever we come So here's health to auld Scotland the brave and the free Her mountains and Glens are the dwellings for me FOR MISS B?LL 1 Just like love is mans desire Now the thorn and then the briar Wounds but never kills desire Just like Love 2 On he journey's ever on Sorrow soon as past is gone Kisses make the world his own Such is love 3 Just like love the wild hedge rose Blushing in the thorns it blows Wounds its worshipers repose The lot of love 4 True love lies bleeding every hour Still 'tis heavens eternal flower Blooming by the lovers bower Eternal love 5 Sun's may lower and storms may rise Heaven and earth may loose their skies Yet naught shall dim in those bright eyes That truely love 6 Love blooms in brightest flowers Love spreads the greenest bowers The heaven of lifes hours Is one true love GREEN HILLS OF NATURE 1 Green hills of nature again I see The pilewort returns to the hum of the bee Again I sit on your verdant swells And listen to the shake of the cowslip bells And see there five brown spots lie Within each golden vest Like light in either eye Or the mole on womans breast While thrushes sing to cheer the spring And charm from east to west 2 Green hills of nature again I see The dews on the flower and the leaf on the tree Again I retire to your valleys and swells And listen the hum o' the bees like bells That sing round the pilewort suns And bow like weighty things Cowslips where the water runs And the bee for honey clings The bright green grass the sky like glass And the brook with the chrystal springs 3 Come dear Amanda come with me Again the delights o' the spring to see Where the valley warps and the green hills swell Hear the bees hum round the cowslips bell With thy bonny face so fair And thy sweet hazel eye With thy long auburn hair And thy lips vermil dye I'll kiss thy dear cheek to the end of the week For Amanda's my only joy JEWISH MAIDS 1 O I love the dark eyes of the Jewish maids Land of Israels diadems Though their lot it be fallen in ruinous shades They shine in the valley bright gems By the plains of Jeosophat sweet they recline Where the temples of God are no more Like flowers from high heaven they blossom divine Though the reign of their prophet is o'er 2 O I love the soft eyes of the dark Jewish maids On the plains of Jeosophat weeping Gods image of beauty in ruins dark shades While their land in its miseries sleeping Their temples are fallen their alters o'erthrown Jerusalems the song singers story Their kings and their Princess's in toombs dead &amp; gone Where the weeds rankle high o'er their glory 3 O I love the dark eyes of the Jewish maids Though their kingdom is perished and fled Perrenial their bloom in their beautiful shades Though they dwell in the tombs of the dead I love the dark eyes of those beautiful girls New Jerusalem shall know them again They shall shine round their alters like diamonds &amp; pearls In Jehovah their love shall remain A WISH 1 I wish I was the bonny thrush That in the hazel sings Hid i' the crimpt leaved stoven bush Where blue the air bell springs I wish I was the little flower Beneath the mossy tree I might enjoy one happy hour A creeping strawberry 2 I hate to hear the vulgar crowd The language of the vain I'd sooner stiffen in a shroud Upon the battle plain My garden then would gather weeds My children look and sigh The tear drops on the book I read While I in prison lie 3 I wish I was the garden pea Beneath the cottage thatch That I my childrens joy might see And all their pleasures watch Or butterfly upon the wing Their little sports to help The sweetest birds that ever sing Are their house sparrows chelp 4 While they laid down their little heads I'd sleep in blebs o' dew And hear them talking in their beds The starry season through And see them in the morning charm Stand 'mong the flowers so cool And take their baskets on their arm And creep like snails to school 5 O I would be an insect In woods and thickets lone An idle thing of solitude To lewder life unknown Hid in the bosom of a flower Its lifetime there to dwell Eternity would seem an hour And I'd be resting well SONG O how can I be blythe and free 1 O how can I be blythe and free While thou art from my side There's more in one kind smile from thee Than all the world beside 2 Falshood is not in natures choice Nor is it found in thee Thy lovely form thy angel voice And temper all agree 3 To form and make thee what thou art The fairest of the fair A handsome face a gentle heart Which love would long to wear 4 O how can I be blythe and free While thou art from my side There's more in one kind smile from thee Than all the world beside SEARCH FOR LOVE 1 I trace every blossom that grows in the field To remember the likeness of love The woodbine that streaks by the cow hovel bield And blooms round the nest of the dove The hedge rose that spreads all its blushes to view Which the morn's pearly diamonds adorns An emblem of love and a picture too true A rose all surrounded with thorns 2 The wood-flowers were blooming above the green moss Some under the song-thrushes nest Morning dews did their beautiful colours emboss But love the green moss hadn't press't Neath the wood rose and bramble wood anemonies grew And the orchis grew richly and rare The rich drooping blossoms were heavy with dew But young love had never been there 3 The fir dale grew tall upon old Clifford hill At its foot the crooked river runs bye Birds and wild flowers live, fly and blossom there still In solitude silence and joy The fir-dales looked rich and loves sweet bonny face Natures fancy full easy discerns Her likeness was hid in that green shady place I' the beauty of Juliet Burns SONG [Who loves the white thorn tree] 1 Who loves the white thorn tree And the river running free There a maiden stood with me In summer weather Near a cottage far from town While the sun went brightly down O'er the meadows green and brown We stood and loved together 2 How sweet her drapery flowed While the moor-cock oddly crowed The kiss which love bestowed Under that white thorn tree Soft winds the water curled The trees their branches furled Sweetest nook in all the world Is where she stood with me 3 Calm came the evening air The sky was sweet and fair I' the river shadowed there Close by the awthorn tree Round her neck I clasped my arms And kissed her rosey charms O'er the flood the Hackle swarms Where the maiden stood wi' me 4 O there's something falls so dear On the music of the ear Where the river runs so clear And my lover met wi' me At the foot of Clifford Hill Still I hear the clacking mill And the river's running still Under the trysting awthorn tree SONG Chelmsford Maid 1 'Twas on a summer's morning I happened for to stray When the farmers got the corn in All by the break of day Down the bonny Che[l]msford meadows By the river running clear There I met a modest maiden In that gay time of the year 2 O bonny was her rosey face And handsome was her gown The sweetest girl in any place The fairest in the town Her eyes were dark like waters deep When black clouds pass the sun And o'er her gown two white hills peep Like snow when springs begun 3 Her bosom's like a heap of snow Among springs early flowers Or lilys that in bunches grow Among the rosey bowers O bonny maid of Chelmsford town Thy beauty is divine There's many a breast as soft as down But few so fair as thine 4 Her face is as the apple round And reddens to the sun When passing bye I see the ground With heart already won I passed her on one morn in May Her eyes were looking down And then my heart was ta'en away By that rose of Chelmsford town JANE W?N 1 Long as bees fly to seek the rose That blooms upon the briar As pilewort on the pasture grows To set the green on fire So long as may blooms deck the thorn And cowslips gild the lea My Jane the fairest maiden born I'll love and think of thee 2 While in the thorn hedge sparrows build And lay their eggs of blue While primrose flowers the green woods gild I'll love and think of you The morn dews hang in christal drops Primrose and blue bell too We'll make the trembling gems to stop But a sweeter gem are you 3 Let nights be short my bonny Jane And morning walks be long The bee bangs at the window pane And bids thee join his song Come walk with me and while the bee Goes singing down the lane I'll cheat him of a flower for thee And dearly love my Jane SONG [O'er the emerald meads I wandered] 1 O'er the emerald meads I wandered In the sunny afternoon Where the rivers flood meandered And the John-go-to-bed at noon Shut up among the grass As the eve was comeing nigh There I saw a bonny lass Wi' kindness in her eye 2 I' gown o' buff and spencer black The maid was neatly dresst And sweetly went the summer rack Soft over heavens breast She went along the meadow grass Like beauty in a dream And lightly stepped the happy lass And gently flowed the stream 3 I saw her in my memories eye An half an hour or more Yet never saw a tree or sky Look half so sweet before The rustling flags and water-birds And pleasant looking weather Like pleasant thoughts and wispering words When lovers talk together 4 They talked to me while standing there And laughed and giggled too And warmly gleamed the summer air The sky was bright and blue How sweet she o'er the meadow went Like pleasures i' the mind And scarcely bowed that horney bent And scarcely stirred the wind 5 But in my heart and in my breast A burning spirit came Her abscence leaves a wild unrest Just like a sco[r]ching flame That burns the aching breast She passt and cometh not again Who went the meadow way My brightest fancy looks in vain E'er since that pleasant day 6 In gown o' buff she passed me bye Along the meadow way And lovely was the autumn sky And pleasant was the day But never can my eye forget The maids buff coloured gown The church tower in the trees is set And that points to the town CLARE TO HIS WIFE 1 O once I had a true love As bless't as I could be Young Patty was my turtle dove And Patty she loved me We walked the fields together By wild roses and woodbine In summers sunshine weather And Patty she was mine 2 We stooped to gather primroses And violets white and blue In pastures and green closes All blistered wi' the dew We sat upon green mole hills Among the daisey flowers To hear the small birds merry thrills And share the sunny hours 3 The blackbird on her grassy nest We would not scare away Who nuzzling sat wi' scorchy breast On her eggs for half the day— The chaffinch cheep'd on the white thorn And a pretty nest had she The magpie chattered all the morn From her nest upon the tree 4 And I would go to Patty's cot And Patty came to mine As happy in each others thought As birds at Valentine And Patty had a kiss to give And Patty had a smile To bid me hope and bid me live At every stopping stile 5 We loved one summer quite away And when another came The cowslip close and sunny day It found us much the same We both looked on the self same thing Till both became as one The birds did in the hedges sing And happy time went on 6 The brambles from the hedge advance In love wi' Patty's eyes On flowers like lady's at a dance Flew scores of butterflies I claimed a kiss at every stile And had her kind replies The bees did round the woodbines toil Where sweet the small wind sighs 7 Then my Patty was a young thing And now she's past her teens And we've been married many springs And mixed in many scenes And I'll be true for Patty's sake And she'll be true for mine And I this little ballad make To be her valentine Oct. 20th/48 CHILDHOOD 1 O dear to us ever the scenes of our childhood The green spots we played in the school where we met The heavy old desk where we thought of the wild-wood Where we pored o'er the sums which the master had set I loved the old church-school, both inside and outside I loved the dear Ash trees and sycamore too The graves where the Buttercups burning gold outvied And the spire where pelitory dangled and grew 2 The bees i' the wall that were flying about The thistles the henbane and mallows all day And crept in their holes when the sun had gone out And the butterfly ceased on the blossoms to play O dear is the round stone upon the green hill The pinfold hoof printed with oxen—and bare The old princess-feather tree growing there still And the swallows and martins wheeling round in the air 3 Where the chaff whipping outward lodges round the barn door And the dunghill cock struts with his hens in the rear And sings ‘Cockadoodle’ full twenty times oer And then claps his wings as he'd fly in the air And there's the old cross with its round about steps And the weathercock creaking quite round in the wind And theres the old hedge with its glossy red heps Where the green-linnets nest I have hurried to find— 4 —To be in time for the school or before the bell rung. There's the odd martins nest o'er the shoemakers door On the shoemakers chimney the Old swallows sung That had built and sung there in the season before Then we went to seek pooty's among the old furze On the heaths, in the meadows beside the deep lake And return'd with torn cloathes all covered wi' burrs And oh what a row my fond mother would make 5 Then to play boiling kettles just by the yard door Seeking out for short sticks and a bundle of straw Bits of pots stand for teacups after sweeping the floor And the children are placed under school-mistress's awe There's one set for pussy another for doll And for butter and bread they'll each nibble an awe And on a great stone as a table they loll The finest small teaparty ever you saw 6 The stiles we rode upon ‘all a cock-horse’ The mile a minute swee On creaking gates—the stools o' moss What happy seats had we There's nought can compare to the days of our childhood The mole-hills like sheep in a pen Where the clodhopper sings like the bird in the wild wood All forget us before we are men Oct. 15th/48 [O could I be as I have been] 1 O could I be as I have been And ne'er can be no more A harmless thing in meadows green Or on the wild sea shore 2 O could I be what once I was In heaths and valleys green A dweller in the summer grass Green fields and places green 3 A tennant of the happy fields By grounds of wheat and beans By gipsey's camps and milking bield Where lussious woodbine leans 4 To sit on the deserted plough Left when the corn was sown In corn and wild weeds buried now In quiet peace unknown 5 The harrows resting by the hedge The roll within the Dyke Hid in the Ariff and the sedge Are things I used to like 6 I used to tread through fallow lands And wade through paths of grain When wheat ears pattered on the hands And head-aches left a stain 7 I wish I was what I have been And what I was could be As when I roved in shadows green And loved my willow tree 8 To gaze upon the starry sky And higher fancies build And make in solitary joy Loves temple in the field [Farewell to love and all I see] Farewell to love and all I see In these dull English skies For all the world turns round wi' me Lost in thy two bright eyes So fare-thee-well—a lover lost I go where none can blame And dearly shall I rue the cost And scarcely keep a name The little flowers and wild birds song I leave them far away In other lands and other tongues A lonely bard to stray In other lands I'll think of thee Nor mortal love adore The north star must its temple be Where nought can change no more MARY A Ballad 1 Love is past and all the rest Thereto belonging fled away The most esteemed and valued best Are faded all and gone away How beautiful was Mary's dress While dancing at the meadow ball —'Tis twenty years or more at least Since Mary seemed the first of all 2 Lord how young bonny Mary burnt With blushes like the roses hue My face like water thrown upon't Turned white as lilies i' the dew When grown a man I went to see The school where Mary's name was known I looked to find it on a Tree But found it on a low grave stone 3 Now is past—was this the now In fine straw-hat and ribbons gay I'd court her neath the white thorn bough And tell her all I had to say But all is gone—and now is past And still my spirits chill alone Loves name that perished in the blast Grows mossy on a church-yard stone Novr. 11th/48. SLEEP ON DEAR BABY 1 Sleep on dear baby thy mother leans o'er thee Thy brother is Shot and thy father's at sea I nothing can tell o' the fate all before thee But God and his angels are talking to thee Thy brother he fell in the heat o' the battle Thy father may yet be alive on the sea But thou'rt growing up for new toys &amp; a rattle For God and his angels are talking to thee 2 Sleep on my baby thy mother bends o'er thee Sleep on in her love babe a beautiful sleep May the raptures of heaven and angels before thee Make thee smile in my face and leave no cause to weep This feather held oer thee will make thee to smile This straw took away love would make thee to weep But nothing but angels on infancy smile So baby sleep on love in beautiful sleep SONG [If abscence can forget me] 1 If abscence can forget me Go where love once met thee And loved so fondly there We both admired together When we courted in spring weather And thyself appeared so fair 2 With kisses I carressed thee As in my arms I press'd thee Go and remember me Remember him who told thee Twas pleasure to behold thee Beneath the hawthorn tree 3 O think of our embraces As I kissed that first of faces T'was neath that hawthorn tree Think when my arms clasped round thee You vowed you e're could love me Now go remember me 4 O think of all I told thee And think I'm left so lonely Go and remember me The willow grey were waving The little brook was raving Where last I met with thee 5 ‘Met last’—two words so lonely May pain my bosom only To be estranged from thee Alone among strange faces Strange town and stranger places O go remember me SONG [Here's the aconite a showing flower] 1 Here's the aconite a showing flower Before the valentine Of every day there is an hour Sweet spring I'll claim as thine I see thee when the first flower comes And love thee while I can I see thee when the wild bee hums And think of Mary Ann 2 The snowdrops in the orchard grass As white as clumps of snow Drooping—tell thee lovely lass That winter's strife must go With all his snow storms drifting deep No longer to trepan The snowdrop wakes the hive bees sleep And I love Mary Ann 3 The first of young springs early hours My bonny love is she The fairest rose in summer bowers Is not so sweet as thee My love she is a bonny lass And I'll seek her when I can The first white daisey in the grass Brings me with Mary Ann— SONG To J??? — W????? — 1 The gnats danced o'er the waters clear And clacking went the mill And open was the rosey brere That scents upon the hill And merrily the swallow swims Home hums the weary bee The sun is lessening and declines Behind the willow tree 2 And I'm sweet Jenney going to see That lives behind the hill Where she can hear as well as me The clacking of the mill The blue fly settles on the dock Then swiftly flies away The sheep boy does the cuckoo mock While rolling taws of clay 3 O my Jenney is a young thing Like blossoms seen in brooks The primrose o' the early spring Is nothing like her looks The snow-flake fair o' ember week The sweet-briar of the rill The white-red of My Jenneys cheek Is sweeter, fairer still 4 The gnats dance o'er the waters clear And clacking goes the mill And open is the rosey brere That blossoms on the hill Like dirty unthawed snow the sheep Lie heaps about the lands Im going my Jenneys trist to keep For 'tis as she demands— SONG ['Twas somewhere in the April time] 1 'Twas somewhere in the April time Not long before the May A sitting on a bank o' thyme I heard a maiden say My truelove is a sailor And e're he went away We spent a year together And here my lover lay— 2 The gold furze were in blossom So was the daisey too The dew pearls on the little flowers Were emeralds in hue On this same summer morning Though then the sabath day He cropt me spring polanthuses Beneath the white thorn may 3 He crop't me spring polanthuses And said if they would keep They'd tell me all loves fusses For dews on them did weep And I did weep at parting Which lasted all the week And when he turned for starting My full heart could not speak 4 The same roots grow polanthus flowers Beneath the same haw tree I cropt them in morns dewy hours And here loves offerings be O come to me my sailor beau And ease my aching breast The storms shall cease to rave &amp; blow And here thy life find rest SONG [In the gloaming o' moonlight so soft and so dreary] 1 In the gloaming o' moonlight so soft and so dreary Where the Nightingale sang in the old whitethorn tree Clear loud and strong while the sky looked so starry It seems full of spirits the fa[r]ther we see With a light pocket handkerchief round her new cap Round her neck the white apron to shield her from dew I stood with young Elenor near the thorn gap Where her bonny white bosom beat warmly and true 2 In the gloaming of moonlight how sweet to be there Among the green bushes that dark shadows throw Standing with sweetheart so bonny and fair To see the sweet blushes all mantle and go There I stood with my Elenor just in her bloom Her face was as fair as the may on the thorn And the woodbine behind her was shedding perfume And there I and Elenor met the next morn 3 Her hair hung like shadows all curly and dark Her face warmed like dog roses under the dew Her soft eyes were rubies and each had a spark That shewed her fond bosom was loveing and true No joy was like courting that maiden at night When moonlight was wispering about to the flowers. 'Twas then I kissed Elenor by that pale light And loved her so dear in those innocent hours SONG [O sweet are the smiles of my light hearted Phebe] 1 O sweet are the smiles of my light hearted Phebe As she goes milking journeys o'er meadow and more She'd make ye grow dizzy as nectar o' Hebe Though ye ne're had a drop of the licquor before As sweet are her cheeks as the crimson eye'd morning That open their lids on the dewy pearled hill Than violet and primrose the coppice adorning Her eyes and her cheeks are more lovelier still 2 Her bosom seems softer than softest of pillows The softest of down's not so white as its hue The snowy rimmed daisey laughing under the willows Is dull when compared to't—tho pearly wi' dew O dear what a face and a bosom has Pheby The violets and lily's were never so fair If maidens could all be such beauties as she be I'd throw down my pen and give way to despair 3 But none seem so lovely and handsome as Pheby And none shew such faces bright eyes and fine hair I praised her red cheeks—my heart jumped to hear Pheby She said you may kiss the first rose you see there I kissed her and felt like an infant gone ‘beeby’ And pressed that sweet rose as long as I dare So I kissed the cheek once of my innocent Pheby And we hope to be one by the end of the year— SONG [Sweet love I see the gales of Spring] 1 Sweet love I see the gales of Spring Are wanton, wooing with thy hair The missle thrush begins to sing The sloe tree shews its blossoms fair The white thorn bush is shewing leaf The path is printed down the lane The grass is green the shower brief Come love now let us meet again 2 O let us meet and walk and love And through the fir dale coppice stray And view the scaley cones above Droop brown as dropping all the way The moss that warms the primrose roots The buds their brimstone flowers contain Where all unchecked the wood rose shoots Sweet love do let us meet again 3 In hat of straw and russet gown And shawl across thy shoulders thrown We'll stroll the coppice up and down Enjoying raptures all our own The scolding calls of noisy jay Shall please our ears and not in vain We'll through the briery coppice stray Sweet love do let us meet again— [Some pretty face remembered in our youth] Some pretty face remembered in our youth Seems ever with us wispering Love &amp; Truth— Augst 27th/48</field>

PRIMROSES 1 I sing of Primroses pale sweet Primroses That deck woods and spinney's and fringe the green lane The briar has its thorns but the thornless first roses Have opened to cheer and not wound us again O sweet are the Primroses down the green lane 2 The white thorn is putting out leaves to the sunshine The moss round their roots is delightfully green The dewy pearled primroses glitter by moonshine And the rich curled leaves look deliciously green In lanes and moss nooks where primroses are seen 3 The hedgerow primroses the pale wood primroses Where brown oaken leaves litter all the year long Neath the broad oaks and hedge-rows about the green closes Where the thrush makes his nest and the blackbird his song Their leaves and their flowers I love all the year long 4 Come again my dear Patty and gather primroses Where blackbirds loud whistle and song thrushes sing I' the leafy strewn woods narrow lanes and green closes How sweet are the Primroses gathered in Spring And round her I've named like the Ivy I'd cling— SONG [The girl I love is flesh and blood] 1 The girl I love is flesh and blood With face and form of fairest clay Straight as the firdale in the wood And lovely as a first spring day 2 The girl I love's a lovely girl Bonny and young in every feature Richer than flowers and strings o' pearl A handsome and delightful creature 3 She's born to grace the realms above Where we shall both be seen together And sweet and fair the maid I love As rose tree's are in summer weather 4 O bonny straight and fair is she I wish we both lived close together Like as the acorns on the tree Or foxglove bell in summer weather 5 Come to me love and let us dwell Where oak trees cluster all together I'll gaze upon thy blossoms well And love, yes love thee then forever 6 Her face is like another's face As white another's skin may prove But no one else could fill her place If banished from the maid I love THE WOODLAND STROLL 1 Among the green bushes where primroses bloom I sing to myself and wander alone And by mossy roots hear the wilding bees hum Persueing the sunbeams with wearisome drone Stealing kisses from primroses all in their bloom 2 I leave the rude noise of the wearisome world And hide me in thickets of white and black thorn Where primroses blossom all crispy and curled And spangled wi' dew at the breath o' the morn. O' theres ne'er such a feeling of joy in the world 3 I wander alone i'th' green white thorn bushes And mock the fond whistles of glad singing birds Where the winds o'er my head like loch river rushes And the musical bleating of heath feeding herds And see birds building nests in the early green bushes 4 Among the green bushes where primroses glisten And violets purple the mossy oak roots Where boys creep i' the thicket to gather and listen And fill trowsers pockets with beautiful toots While the sun o'er the trees has just risen 5 Among the green bushes where primroses bloom I sing to myself as I wander alone And among the wood flowers hear the wilding bee's hum Persueing its ramble with wearisome drone Stealing kisses from primroses in their first bloom THE WALK WITH LOVE 1 I walk with thee and meet the spring In most delicious weather Birds whistle and the blossoms spring We see and hear together And one and the same time we see The pale primroses bloom The skylarks sing o'er grassy lea And linnets in the broom There's nothing upon earth can be So sweet as walks with love and thee 2 I walk with thee, I with thee walk We spend our Sunday hours together Both hear the music of the bee And butterflies in sunny weather Both at the same time look and see The lark ascends we see him rise And hear him sing his melodies A little speck in the blue skies There's nought so sweet in summer weather As love, and seeing things together 3 Both see the bloom and hear the thrush In white thorn bushes sing his song The blackbirds nest in the next bush Both see the eggs then rove along Both gaze together on the brook See silver waves o'er pebbles run Both read together o'er one book Beneath green trees or in the sun In courtship there can nothing be So sweet as talk and love with thee THE INVITATION 1 Come hither my fair one my choice one &amp; rare one And let us be walking the meadows so fair Where pilewort &amp; daiseys—In light &amp; gold blazes And the wind plays so sweet in thy bonny brown hair 2 Come in thy maiden eye—lay silks and satins bye Come in thy russet or green cotton gown Come to the meads my dear where flag sedge &amp; reeds appear Rustling to soft winds &amp; bow up and down 3 Come with thy parted hair, bright eyes and forhead bare Come to the white thorn that grows in the lane On banks of primroses where sweetness reposes Come love and let us be happy again 4 Come where the speedwell flowers, come where the morning showers Pearl on the primrose and speedwell so blue Come to that clearest brook, that ever runs round the nook Where you and I pledged our first love so true— TO MISS D.W.— 1 There is a maid, and she to me Is all that love may ever be To meet at morn her rosey smiles With loves delight my bosom boils To meet her i' the evening dew Is sweetest joy I ever knew I dare do anything but tell The name of her I love so well 2 She has to me the sweetest mind And fairest face o' woman kind Her soul within her bright eye glows Her red lips are the parted rose Her bosom fair the lilys light Is nothing near so fair and white Her voice to me is more than fame My cheek turns pale to hear her name 3 I never dare as yet presume To kiss her cheeks carnation bloom To her I dare no talk design And yet I think the maiden's mine Still mine if but the maiden knew I'd tremble like a drop o' dew Love hides a yolk within the shell The bird I never dare to tell SONG [My sweet Irish Kitty] 1 My sweet Irish Kitty Fair lovely and pretty Takes all the shine out of our fair Dublin city. For Kitty you know in her silk gown o' green Is all over Ireland the Irishmans queen So now Mr. Bull gi's no more of your Blarney Irelands queen is all right and she lives at Killarney 2 And handsome and pretty Is beautiful Kitty There's ne'er such another in a' Dublin city She's sometimes in black, and she's sometimes in green In each dress she wears she's the Irishmans queen So now Mr Bull gi's no more of your Blarney The queen o' ould Ireland's the Maid o' Killarney 3 O buxom young Kitty So lovely and pretty She takes all the shine out o' Dublins fair city In satins or silks o' black, blue, white or green And all over Ireland she's the Irishmans queen So Mr John Bull you may stifle your Blarney Ould Ireland's proud queen is the Maid o' Killarney— [The morning wakes dewy &amp; sunny &amp; light] 1 The morning wakes dewy &amp; sunny &amp; light By the hedges the Arum's green glossy and bright And spring's getting greener from morning to night The dews pearl on pilewort &amp; on violets blue Rural maids by the stile court their lovers so true 2 I' the hedges hedge sparrows continually cheep Further in by the mossy roots primroses peep Riddled wool on the white thorn torn off from the sheep I' the green leaves hangs white as snows melted &amp; fled While the ivy leaves bright shiver wispers o'er head 3 Like the wispering of lovers, that each other greet— The blackthorn's in blossom as white as a sheet The green moss elastic springing under the feet While cuckoo's and blue bells sprout up and appear And shows where the dew fell the spring o' the year CLIFFORD HILL 1 The river rambles like a snake Along the meadow green And loud the noise the mill wheels make I' summer time at e'en And there as swift the waters pass So runs the life of man I sit me down upon the grass These beauties for to scan 2 Tis summers day and dewy eve And sweet the sun sinks low I smile, and yet my heart will greive To see the waters flow To see the flags that look so green The sun gilt waves so bright I wander here this lovely e'en In wonder and delight 3 The firs look dark on Clifford hill The river bright below All foamed beneath the water mill While beautious flowers do blow 'Tis here I'd wander morn and night With fondly gazing eye To see the sunny golden light Go down in yonder sky— 4 Yes dearly do these scenes I love And dear that fir clad hill There all secure does build the dove While click-clack goes the mill And now in natures sweet repose I leave this spot awile The bee is buried in the rose And man gone from his toil FIRST LOVE 1 I ne'er was struck before that hour With love so sudden and so sweet Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower And stole my heart away complete My face turned pale a deadly pale My legs refused to walk away And when she looked what could I ail My life and all seemed turned to clay 2 And then my blood rushed to my face And took my eyesight quite away The trees and bushes round the place Seemed midnight at noon day I could not see a single thing Words from my eyes did start They spoke as chords do from the string And blood burnt round my heart 3 Are flowers the winters choice Is love's bed always snow She seemed to hear my silent voice Not loves appeals to know I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before My heart has left its dwelling place And can return no more— MY SAILOR LAD 1 O well I mind the morn was chill The black thorn hung i' drops And gaily turned the old smock mill Though now it almost stops In jacket and in trowsers blue I left my sailor lad The ocean keeps him stout and true And he was all I had 2 A slight shower fell from a light sky And pearled each grassy blade And half put out the daisey eye All gold and silver rayed And on each freckled fox glove bell Hung rows &amp; strings o' pearl When he last kissed and loved me well And called me ‘dearest girl’ 3 Three times the common has been white With daiseys since he went The white thorn blossoming i' light The foxglove downward bent But he's not yet to me returned That gave my bosom joy Nor one day have I sat and mourned My abscent sailor boy SONG [The maple hangs its green bee flowers] 1 The maple hangs its green bee flowers All pendant to the summer showers Above the blue-bell drooping flowers Where may-time tinges the skies My mountain pearl My lovely girl My dearest maid arise 2 The daisey hills the mossy woods The cultures fields the meadow floods Green leaves expanding from spring buds Neath skies all crisp and curled My own dear girl And bosom pearl Come forth and charm the world 3 Come forth my own my charming girl With rosey face and teeth of pearl Where green grass quakes and rivers swirl Through finest scenery My hopes above My fond first love Come out and walk with me 4 How purple light delights to dwell Within the Canterbury bell Beside the wood-rale blooming well My mountain maid arise These flowers we'll view In morning dew To gladden thy bright eyes 5 A dew drop on the kingcup lies While from its root the ground lark flies The sun is mounting up the skies And gilds the stretching glade Awake and come Awile from home And be my own dear maid THE PARTING 1 O the moment was sad when I went from my true love With her red cheeks and bright eyes blue grey I kissed her wet cheek and ne'er sighed for a new love And the wind sighed by us that day I saw her heart sob wi' my arm on her shoulder More fast than a watch while I fond did enfold her And all the soft thoughts o' my fond heart I told her While my cheek on her bosom did lay 2 Ere the breezes of eve put the green leaves i' motion Wi' her red rose cheek and her eyes blue grey I left my fond lover to cross the wide ocean And the white thorn covered with may Wi' my arm round her waist and my cheek on her breast It beat like a watch and its sorrows confest I kissed that fair cheek and lull'd her to rest Then steered for the fleet in the bay 3 Poor girl she stood there more fixed than a statue And white as the marble even paler than snow At the brig foot the bramble leaved thorny and matty As the sun on its leaves glittered golden and low Round my neck her white arms did most fondly enfold me I kissed her fond lips Cupid smiled to behold me And love the most fond in my abscence he told me Ere from her I tore me to go THE SAILOR 1 O once I loved a sailor well Dear as I loved my life What ailed me I could never tell But I longed to be his wife He looked at me when I loved him Love is a strong prevailer I loved my beau, so tight and trim And longed to wed my sailor 2 In trowsers and in jacket blue I saw him pace the ship And gaze upon the ocean blue And walk without a trip No fear was in his manly face No tremor in his tread He marched the deck with steady pace Where he had fought and bled 3 He calmly gazed across the blue A man in every limb In trowsers and in jacket blue None looked so clean and trim I gazed upon him one fine day While lying within shore My heart the sailor stole away He keeps for ever more SONG [Meet me in the primrose lane] 1 Meet me in the primrose lane When moonlight lives above thee I'll kiss thy rosey face again And everlasting love thee 2 Meet me where white clover grows In the dewy grass love Meet me where white roses blows And brooks run clear as glass love 3 In the evening I intreat thee When the dew is on the breere Down the lane o' woodbines meet me While the brook is running clear 4 While the round moon shines so brightly And the diamond star o' even O'er the lime trees shineth nightly Making earth a lovers heaven 5 Among the short white blossom'd clover Neath the ash trees shadows there While the clouds the moon flies over Let me meet my angel fair 6 Kiss good night—and ease my bosom Rest my hope in slumbers then While the dew drop pearls the blossom And silence sleeps about the glen— THE WILD ROSE 1 The hedge rose blossoms like thy face Sweet red and white together And shadows wave about the place Where branches twist together 2 The leaves dance to a merry tune And boughs wave like to billows A flowry carpet throughout june And concert in the willows 3 Dews bead the headaches like to gems And corn blades like to rain God's love does nothing here condemn All live free from sins pain 4 Then let us meet at dewy morn Or else at golden noon Or evening mid the waving corn Or night while shines the moon 5 The hedge row was our tristing place Beside the rose tree fair There nature smiled on thy sweet face The fairest wild rose there THE HUMBLE BEE 1 When lifes tempests blow high In seclusion I tread Where the primroses lie And the green mosses spread Where the bottle tit hangs At the end of a twig Where the humble bee bangs That is almost as big 2 Where I feel my heart lonely I am solitudes own Talking to myself only And walking woods lone In the wood briars and brambles Hazel stools and oak trees I enjoy such wood rambles And hear the wood bees 3 That sing their wood journey And stop at wood blooms Where the primroses burn ye And the violet perfumes There to myself talking I rub through the bushes And the boughs where I'm walking Like a sudden wind rushes 4 The wood gate keeps creaking Opened ever so slow And from boughs bent to breaking Often starts the odd crow Right down the green riding Gladly winds the wild bee Then through the wood side in He sucks flowers in glee 5 He flies through the stovens Brown hazel and grey Through fern leaves like ovens Still singing his way He rests on a moss bed And perks up his heels And strokes o'er his small head Then hies to the fields 6 I enjoy these wood rambles And the juicey wheat fields Where the wood rose—and brambles A showers covert yields I love the wood journey Where the violets melt blue And primroses burn ye With flames the day through THE MILLERS DAUGHTER 1 Where ducks dive in the silent water And geese about the river swim A miller had a handsome daughter Beautiful in shape and limb Her hair and eye was dark and handsome Her neck and bosom like the swan White fair and sweet—a poets ransom To glad and cheer the heart of man 2 I love the millers handsome daughter And bonny Susan is her name I courted her a year and quarter And wrote this ballad on her name I courted her beside the river While bright the silver moon beam shone I'd clasp her in my arms for ever And vow to love but her alone 3 The moonlight shone on trees and farms The waves like gold and silver past While Susan smiled within my arms And each smile lovelier than the last Soft wispering words the sedges made The moonlight rippled on the water Where I that evening wooed the maid The honest Millers handsome daughter— TO L. M.? 1 My dear Lucy Mary my sweet Lucy Mary How can you love truely by acting contrary To say that you would and then would not walk out You bring me my death when you leave me in doubt O sweet Lucy Mary how can you do so Such a fine day as this is and then never go At first you said yes—but an hour is gone bye And now you say no—which makes me to sigh 2 The wind from the road blows the March dust about And the bees on the hive slabs spread their wings and fly out The sparrows chirp glad and the laying hens prate While young Lucy Mary looks over the gate The needle you sew with pricks me to the bone And the heart in your bosom is none but my own So come my own Mary to walk let's be gone You and I both together will only make one 3 My dear Lucy Mary as loved as you'r fair Let me see that sweet cheek shaded by thy dark hair May I kiss thy sweet lips and see heaven nigh As true as it is in the light of the sky O let me now love thee—I'll love thee the best Then I'll love all the world, and its sorrows to rest For heaven that lies in the gleams o' the west Is sweeter and dearer in dear womans breast [In the seasons o' swallows that brings the bright sun] 1 In the seasons o' swallows that brings the bright sun And never comes nigh 'till the lammies a' run Ever skimming and crossing the gravel paved brook While the children bright daisies and buttercups look 2 I courted a maid without satin or silk That went all the week—night and morning to milk And sat on the rest harrow by the mole hill Where I first fell in love—and I see her sit still 3 The sun was a setting—the cowpasture pond Curved i' wrinkles o' gold and o' silver beyond The molehills where covered in patches o' thyme And the season for courting was just in its prime 4 Her face it was lovely and so was her clothes A hue the same colour on the sweet briar grows Her neck and her shoulders was whiter than milk And her lips were so soft—yes much softer than silk 5 Her words fell like music from those pretty lips And her eyes—as the fly in the water pond dips Owned two sparks of light that made the sun dim While the dragon-fly darted about the pond brim 6 On the pasture I courted her both even and morn Till the rest harrow podded and ripe was the corn Yes I've loved her there by the side of that hill And they tell me she blooms and is lovelier still [Come away come away to the wild wood] 1 Come away come away to the wild wood Where the bramble o'erhangs the foot way The scenes o' my love youth and childhood Where I with young Hannah did stray The bits of wood hang on the briar Which small birds seek for nests The pettichap that sings so quere And robins riddle brests— 2 Come away come away to the scenes of our childhood And we'll find out the red robins nest The bramble bush grows in the wild wood That owns the song thrush for a guest Come away come away to the bramble Come away to the hazle and thorn To the scenes o' our youth let us ramble And be happy as sunshine just born 3 Come away to the oak and the ivy To the fox earths that hides i' the thorn Where the oak trunks look whiter than smoke i the morn Come away come away at the burst of the sun There is flowers to be gathered and joy to be won So come on my sweet one—and let us be there Where hyacinth and primroses blossom so fair 4 Come away to the haunts o' the bird and the bee And listen to music o' natures grand art Where the flowers beat all painting do come now with me For music and beauty must never more part Come away to the woods where the oaks glitter green And brown lie in heaps where last winter has been Where the bloom o' the thorn is as white as a sheet And the moss like green velvet flowers under your feet Come away my sweet one my choice come away And we'll spend a sweet hour in the woodlands to day SCOTLAND 1 Ould Scotlands bonny woods and braes And streams that rin a hundred ways Where lassies show their tartan claes Your hills are doubly dear Your hills in clouds that leave the e'e Your rivers rinning to the sea Perpetual green your valleys be An Eden a' the year 2 Land where the thistle's bleum sojourns O' Alice Nichol Jeannie Burns Where sang an' beauty a' sojourns Companions a' the year Land o' the thistle and white rose Where milk an' mountain hinney flows Where heather like an ocean grows A world without a' peer— 3 Land o' the honest nun forsakes The whiskey gill and nodden cakes Which Scottish lassies brews and makes A' gude their health shall be May peace gleam round the thistles bloom And God send a' the ills that cum Oer a' thy hills i' gleam and gloom And Scotland will be free HERE'S TO AULD SCOTLAND 1 Here's to auld Scotland's hills and dells All round her sea beat shore A hundred thousand last farewells And adieu's for evermore But to the stars o' that sweet land Whose eyes are like the sun I might bid farewell for ever and And never more be done 2 Its Ailsies and its Jeanies there Its Nichols Thoms's Burns There none sa sweet and none sa fair In other lands sojourns The rose in ither bonnie face The lilies o' the breast Sic like in ony ither place War niver seen or guest 3 The inward blushes o' the rose In living beauty dims And not so white the lily grows As are their lovely limbs Here's to ould Scotlands hills and dells All round her sea washed shore A hundred thousand last farewells And adieus for ever more COME! COME IN THE FIELDS 1 O come wi' the music o' birds i' the bushes The songs o' the blackbirds the music o' thrushes The budding o' white thorn the daisey's i' bloom My lovely young lassie array thee and come Come away to the wood side the hedge row and rushes Where the sweet little birds build their nests in the bushes Come my lovely Miss Wilson and walk out wi' me Down the grassy wood side—and the sweet meadow lea 2 The rooks their spring musical noises are making The cowslips are peeping among grasses green The swift racking clouds o'er the heavens are breaking 'Till a' the bright blue o' its ceiling is seen My lovely Miss Wilson thou beautiful creature Come come in the fields this beautiful noon Thy beauty is Venus in every feature Then haste thee my sweet one and come with me soon 3 The pewit is swooping and whewing and screaming The amber trailed willow is mouse eared wi' leaves Woolpacks o' clouds o'er the heavens are streaming Sweet green is the tint now the meadow receives My sweetest Miss Wilson put on thy straw bonnet By the violet bank and awthorn come to me soon We'll walk the short grass with the morn dew upon it And wisper fond love before afternoon— MARY BOYFIELD 1 How beautiful the summer night When birds roost on the mossy tree When moon and stars are shining bright And home has gone the weary bee Then Mary Boyfield seeks the glen The white awe-thorn and grey oak tree And nought but heaven can tell me then How dear thy beauty is to me 2 Dear is the dew-drop to the flower The old wall to the weary bee And silence to the evening hour And ivy to the stooping tree Dearer than these than all beside Than blossoms to the moss rose tree The maid who wanders by my side Sweet Mary Boyfield is to me— 3 Sweet is the moonlight on the tree The stars above the glassy lake That from the bottom look at me Through shadows on the crimping brake Sweet are such things but sweeter still Than these and all beside I see The maid to whom I mean no ill Dear Mary Boyfield is to me 4 O Mary with the dark brown hair The rosey cheek the beaming eye I would thy shade was ever there Then never more I'd grieve or sigh I love thee Mary dearly love There's nought so fair on earth I see There's nought so dear in heaven above As Mary Boyfield is to me SONG [Dear Phebe I love thee and that on for ever] 1 Dear Phebe I love thee and that on for ever And thy heart in thy bosom shall ne'er have a fear in't I'll meet thee this once and I'll part wi' thee never Thy love shall be sweetness without any tear in't I love thee sweet Phebe my dearest I love thee The green grass beneath thee the clouds sail above thee In my hearts first affections none other could moove me As the woodbine the oak—nought but death e're should part me 2 I'll part wi' thee never thou fond one thou fair one And sweet will the bud be when thy branches bear one The flower o' its mother and nothing's more fair Sweet maid o' the bright eye and dark flowing hair With a song like the thrush and a voice like the dove Her eyes and her thoughts breathe of nothing but love Soft as the winds wispers that bends the flowers down Or stir o' the little weeds brushed by thy gown— 3 Sweet Phebe my dearest my beautiful Phebe With a face full o' roses and bosom o' snow A bosom o' snow love where Cupid goes beeby— And beautiful veins o'er the lily banks flow Then Phebe my darling round the strings o' thy apron I'd uggle my arms like the wings of a Capon To kiss the milk white of thy bosom so fair And rose on thy cheek hid in leaves o' black hair BY CLARE—TO BE PLACED AT THE BACK OF HIS PORTRATE PRESENTED TO INSKIP BY MRS.

of the wild flowers Rain washed and wind shaken Dear to thee was mild showers And heaths o' green bracan The song o' the wild bird Than nothing seemed dearer The low o' the mild herd And sheep bleating nearer 3 Bard o' the sheep pen The stack yard and stable The hovel in bracken glen Where a stone makes a table There the white daisey blooms With a tear in his eye There Jenny Wren comes When

A THOUGHT A night without a morning A trouble without end A life of bitter scorning A world without a friend June 30th/49 MARY APPLEBY 1 Mary Appleby come now the spring is here fairly And leave the dull city and town Come where the cowslips all blossom so early And the plovers they swoop up and down The deepest green shade it lies on the grass And the deepest green leaf's on the white thorn tree And I will walk there with a sweet bonny lass My beautiful young Mary Ann Appleby— 2 Beautiful morning comes sweet Mary Appleby The grasses are beaded wi' April dew There starts the butterfly and the drone dapple bee And all the gay landscape seems waiting for you 3 How sweet in the morn the flight o' the swallow How sweet rushes wave i' the swamps o' the lake The daiseys and ladysmocks bloom i' the hollow And loud is the calling the pewit birds make O come Mary Appleby sweet Mary Appleby Gather bright cowslips upon the green lea Come wi' gold butterfly and the great dapple bee For surely dear Mary I dearly love thee SONG [How sweet are the songs o' the birds i' the bushes] 1 How sweet are the songs o' the birds i' the bushes When April's soft showers pearl the flowers on the lea I look into nests o' the blackbirds and thrushes And think how one loves them that's dear unto me O was she but with me I think so and often Among the green bushes how glad should I be Where her smiles would delight and her kindness would soften The sorrows that trouble this bosom and me 2 We looked for birds nests when left children together And gathered the primrose by thorns mossy roots How bright shone the sun and sweet was the weather We looked at the blossoms and hunted for fruits We clomb up the dyke bank and mastered it often And sometimes fell backward and made a sore place Now fair as a snowdrop mans hardships to soften She ne'er looks the bloom o' a smile in my face 3 She's vain o' her person and proud o' her beauty The sun seems to fade at the light o' her eye She's Venus's self from her cap to her shoe tie And charms all to worship that chance to go bye How sweet are the songs o' the blackbirds and thrushes How sweet is the hum of the Midsummer bee And courting my lover among the green bushes Makes the green earth itself what the heaven will be MARY FEATHERSTONE 1 O bonny Mary Featherstone she stole my heart away One year she kept it prisoner—I knew not what to say She kept my heart a prisoner and like a clocking hen I clucked o' notes o' tenderness when the chickins leave the pen I looked upon her pink gown that fitted her so well As fellons look on heaven through the burning chinks o' hell Her gown was pink her hair was black her bonny face was fair And I sighed for Mary Featherstone 'till it bordered on dispair 2 O bonny Mary Featherstone no maid could her excell When among the sweet spring flowers in a pink gown she did dwell Her hair was black as any coal and rosy pink her gown Her eyes were bright her lips more sweet than any face in town Young bonny Mary Featherstone was bonny as the flowers And I've stood near the wicket gate to notice her for hours Bright bloomed the mallows silken flowers a dress o' sattin hue They bloomed where she was daily seen so bonny and so true 3 O bonny Mary Featherstone on her my fancies dwell I love her all the year about but that I never tell I love to see her garden gay—the pretty flowers beside For there my bonny Mary in her dwelling does reside And day and night the year about I do nought else but think Of bonny Mary's rosy face and curls as black as ink And if she dont relieve me I very soon must go To the land of death and shadows in the regions down below JANE WILSON 1 Sweet is the mild snowdrop that comes in the spring When the homely drest hedge sparrow ventures to sing The crocus how sweet looking-glass o' the sun It opens and glitters when spring has begun And the love light o' spring I in exstacy see In the rich amber trails o' the grey willow tree But sweeter and fairer than all that I see Is the beautiful form of young Jenny to me 2 How sweet flows the river that swells in the sun Like billows o' gold they foam sparkle and run How sweet the white thorn blossoms sprinkled wi' dew How bright the kingfisher in orange and blue How sweet the reeds rustle at evenings hour When the rose hides the bee in the breast of the flower But sweeter than reeds or the river to see Is Jenny's sweet voice speaking kindly to me 3 She speaks me so kind, when we rest in this place And I feel my heart warm as I look in her face The willow waves o'er us so dusky and grey As we rest and admire the sweet close of the day, I stoop to the river to pluck her a flower And we hear the birds sing at days closing hour But dearer than flowers or the birds unto me Is Jenny the loved one—I love only thee— SONG [Lucy bonny Lucy Brown] 1 Lucy bonny Lucy Brown The prettiest girl in our town With her in love I've often been By shady woods and meadows green 2 Her face was like the apple round Her voice had music in the sound The prettiest girl in all the town Was Lucy bonny Lucy Brown 3 Her cheek was soft her eye was bright Like diamonds of the purest light She lived the toast of all the town The prettiest girl was Lucy Brown 4 Her bubbies they were love to see More than the sight of heaven could be Eve's was not more white than they The most angelic form of clay 5 O lovely bonny Lucy Brown The sweetest choice of all the town Mine lot was sorrow to repine Till Lucy promised to be mine SONG [I would not feign a single sigh] 1 I would not feign a single sigh Nor weep a single tear for thee The soul within these orbs burns dry A desert spreads where love should be I would not be a worm to crawl A wreathing suppliant in thy way For love is life, is heaven and all The beams of an immortal day 2 For sighs are idle things, and vain And tears for idiots vainly fall I would not kiss thy face again Nor round thy shining slippers crawl Love is the honey not the bee Nor would I turn its sweets to gall For all the beauty found in thee Thy lily neck, rose cheek and all 3 I would not feign a single tale Thy kindness or thy love to seek Nor sigh for Jenny of the vale Her ruby smile or rosy cheek I would not have a pain to own For those dark curls, and those bright eyes A frowning lip, a heart of stone False love and folly I despise LITTLE TROTTY WAGTAIL 1 Little trotty wagtail he went in the rain And tittering tottering sideways he near got straight again He stooped to get a worm and look'd up to catch a fly And then he flew away e're his feathers they were dry 2 Little trotty wagtail he waddled in the mud And left his little foot marks trample where he would He waddled in the water pudge and waggle went his tail And chirrupt up his wings to dry upon the garden rail 3 Little trotty wagtail you nimble all about And in the dimpling water pudge you waddle in and out Your home is nigh at hand and in the warm pigsty So little Master Wagtail I'll bid you a ‘Good bye’ Augst 9th/49 THE SWALLOW 1 Pretty Swallow once again Come and pass me i' the rain Pretty swallow why so shy Pass again my window by 2 The horse pond where he dips his wings The wet day prints it full o' rings The rain drops on his [airy] track Lodge like pearls upon his back 3 Then agen he dips his wing In the wrinkles of the spring Then o'er the rushes flies again And pearls roll off his back like rain 4 Pretty little swallows fly Village doors and windows by Whisking o'er the garden pales Where the blackbird finds the snails 5 Whewing by the ladslove tree For something only seen by thee Pearls that on the red rose hings Falls off shaken by thy wings 6 On yon low that[c]hed cottage stop In the sooty chimney pop Where thy wife and family Every evening wait for thee— THE FOREST MAID 1 O once I loved a pretty girl and dearly love her still, I courted her in happiness for two short years or more And when I think of Lucy it turns my bosom chill For the happiest of lifes happiness is faded and is o'er. O fair was Lucy Littlechild and happy as the bee And sweet was bonny Lucy as the song of forest bird And the smile upon her red lips was very dear to me And her tale of love the sweetest that my ear has ever heard 2 O the flower o' the forest was Lucy Littlechild There's few could be so dear to me and none could be so fair So many love the garden flowers I still esteem the wild And Lucy of the forest is the fairest blossom there She's fairer than the wild rose that blooms among the thorn She's dearer to my eye than the bloom upon the brere Her eye is brighter far than the bonny pearls o' morn And the name of Lucy Littlechild to me is ever dear 3 O once I loved a pretty girl—the linnet in its mirth Was never half so blest as I wi' Lucy Littlechild The rose o' the creation and the pink o' all the earth The flower o' all the forest and the best for being wild O sweet are dews o' morning ere the autumn blows so chil[l] And sweet are forest flowers i' the awthorns mossy shade But nothing is so fair and nothing ever will Bloom like the rosey cheek o' my bonny Forest Maid BONNY LASSIE O 1 We'll ma' be meet no more bonny Lassie O, For it mickle bodeth me Now I'm going to cross the sea That our courtship may be o'er Bonny lassie O, The burnie rinning clear And the bonny fragrant brere Tomorrow will be here Bonny lassie O But when I'm left the shore I'll may be meet no more The maid I most adore And that is none but thee Bonny Lassie O. 2 There's a tear upon thy e'e bonny Lassie O. But if I be the cause I maun obey the laws And force my sen to sea bonny Lassie O Here's the burnie will be here And rinning just as clear As now both are standing here bonny Lassie O But when the worst is past And the die o' hope is cast And I've look'd on thee the last Wilt thou shed a tear for me bonny lassie O— 3 I can but say I may bonny Laddie O But can thou see them fa' On this heather bloom sa' sma' When thou art on the sea Bonny laddie O— I canna' say I may But I'll sorely rue the day And wish the worst away Bonny lassie O If my lassie true remain Then I care na' fo' the Main But we'll surely meet again And I'll kiss thee in these flowers Bonny lassie O. OH COME TO ME AT EVEN! O come to me i' the evening And let us walk together When talking is believing And beautiful the weather There's a siller bleb in the golden eye O daisies by the thorn On the wildings purest diamonds lie The souls o' summer morn But come to me i' the even Love When the lark drops in the corn O come to me at even dear By the brambles arching shade And hear the blackbird singing near And be my own dear maid O let me clasp thee round the waist In evenings dewy air And when so tenderly embraced Confess my passion there Confess the passion of Mans love In evenings dewy air And kiss thee 'neath the heavens above A maid surpassing fair The birds gone bed on bush and tree Where leaves keep off the dew So come my angel love to me We'll kiss and love so true I'll kiss thy neck so snowy white Thy lips so dear to me While the round moon with increasing light Mounts up behind the tree The dew lies on the woodbine flower And on the wild rose too Then in the spreading white thorn bower I'll aye be kissing you HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS How beautiful it is to be Left in the fields at Eve When blackbirds perch upon the tree And whistle till they leave To seek their nests o' moss and grass In white thorn hedges there And then to meet the milking lass So bonny and so fair How beautiful it is at Eve To walk the green woodside The labours o' the day to leave And in green fields abide The thrush sits on her eggs o' blue Hid by the blooming brier And Jenny Wren hides from the dew In furze bush blooming near How beautiful it is to leave The paths o' sultry day At dewy fall o' quiet Eve Through coppices to stray Where cat-tail grass nodds o'er the path And rabbits come to feed Benighted bee clings to the swarth And grasshoppers to the weed How beautiful at close o' day To wander where we will To view the white thorn hung wi' may And Moonlight i' the rill And where the hedge the journey stops The Moon hangs dripping o'er And in the pastures rushes drop[s] Till it is seen no more MY SWEET LUCY GREY The pretty flowers were springing In fields and meadows green The little birds were singing Where winter floods had been Where I went to see my true love Along the meadow way Neath the willow rows and dew love A courting Lucy Grey A bonny hat of finest straw And ribbons black and blue Her lips the bright and glossy haw Her cheeks the roses dipt in dew O she was fair as ony thing And beautiful as gay Blythe as a bonny morn o' spring Was my sweet Lucy Grey O we loved and walked together Both at the night time and the day And my foot was in loves tether When young Lucy went away That morning when she parted I scarce knew what to say And I felt half broken hearted For the loss of Lucy Grey MY OWN SWEET SALLY GEE O' I love the young and english Rose That grows upon the hedge row brier It seems the fairest flower that blows And still reminds me O my dear It reminds me O' her bonny brow When she spoke her mind to me Her cheeks were red her bosom snow And I loved my Sally Gee The winds took pleasure o'er the grass And in the flowers to dally And sweet the feet O' my fair lass There's none like pretty Sally Green Linnets sung on the white thorn And black caps on the willow tree But the sweetest thing O' night or morn Is my own sweet Sally Gee O Sally Gee is beautiful And Sally Gee is fair Her cheeks are roses which we cull In mornings dewy air Her bosom is as white as snow And whiter it may be And the sweetest and dear rose below Is my own sweet Sally Gee SWEET MARY O' THE PLOUGH The latter end of Autumn When the trees were turning yellow When the garden flowers were dead and gone And all the fruit were mellow When ponds and rivers were cram'ful Wi' sudden showers O' rain I went to see my true love O'er the dirty roads again O'er moors and mosses Slups and sloughs I went to see her many miles The hips were scarlet awes were red And beautiful were Mary's smiles That lonely house beside the road I can't imagine how But I'm always sad when I pass bye Sweet Mary O' the plough In early youth when love was sweet So sweet no words can tell I went far off a courting A maiden I loved well The woods were faded every where And leaves began to drop The Squirrels sputtering up the tree And acorns from the top Fell pattering on the dirty ground And bursted from their cups For which the school Boy running bye Full very often stoops Love urged me on my journey Beneath each fadeing bough That autumn morn I went to see Sweet Mary of the Plough The autumn it is pleasant Though fadeing fast away When the lover goes a courting Upon an autumn day The falling leaves they littered Every bit o' greensward ground And fell about my foot steps Wi' many a pleasing sound The old crows quawked for men had cut Among the oak wood trees While many coloured sort o' leaves Came wailing on the breeze The wind blew up the clouds And I felt I knew not how When I went to see my sweetheart Sweet Mary of the Plough BANTRY BAY On the eighteenth of October We lay in Bantry Bay All ready to set sail With a fresh and steady gale A fortnight and nine days We in the harbour lay And no breeze e'r reached us Or strained a single sail Three ships of war had we And the great guns loaded all But our ships were dead and beaten That had never feared a foe The wind becalmed around us Car'd for no cannon ball They locked us in the harbour And would not let us go On the nineteenth of October By eleven of the clock The sky turned black as midnight And a sudden storm came on Awful and sudden And the cables felt the shock Our anchors they all broke away And every stay was gone The guns fired off amid the strife But little hope had we The billows broke above the ship And left us all below The crew with one consent cried Bear further out to sea But the waves obeyed no sailors call And we knew not where to go She foundered on a rock While we clambered up the shrouds And staggered like a mountain drunk Wedged in the waves almost The red hot boiling billows Foamed in the stooping clouds And in that fatal tempest The whole ships crew were lost Have pitty for poor Mariners Ye landsmen in a storm O' think what they endure at sea While safe at home you stay All ye that sleep on beds at night In houses dry and warm O' think upon the whole ships crew All lost at Bantry Bay [T'was in the midst of June] T'was in the midst of June When the meadows they were green When the hay was thronged wi' butterflys From morning time till e'en When swarms of bees were singing All about the meadow flowers And dew drops on the grass so green Fell i' the morning hours As thick as drops O' diamonds As thick as showers O' pearl I went across the meadow Wi' my bonny Oundle Girl I crossed with her the meadows Right early i' the morn When the crow sat on the willows And the lark sung from the corn Her face was fair and handsome Her dress cornbottle blue Her cheeks were like the meadow pink That grows beside the lake I clasped around her white neck And I loved her leal and true And a dog rose from The wild briar I gathered For her sake The honey button burnet Looked black above the grass And the major meadow daisy's Waved like the foaming surf I wandered by the side O' The bonny bosomed lass Who lightly as an angel Stept o'er the satin turf The meadow it was beautiful The hedges they were gay And meadow flowers among the grass Were loveliest in hue As o'er the pleasant meadow land Our love walk lay Over clumps of lady fingers MY LOVE IN DISHABILLE T'was in the month of April when birds all merry sing I took a walk to Kingsthorp right early i' the spring I took a walk to Kingsthorp right early i' the day And there I met my true love go barefoot by the way Her ancles they were handsome and lovely was her feet Her face was like an Irish girls and beautifully sweet She passed me like a stranger I think I see her still I could not tell my own true love in such a dissabille Her eyes were like two diamonds and a woman all complete I could have knelt on both my knees and kissed her very feet I loved her where I passed and love her dearly still But I could not tell my own true love in such a disabille She passed me by in silence I passed her by the same I could not tell her person I did not know her name But her person I love dearly and I love her dearly still Though I did not know my own true love in rags and disabille AMONG THE GREEN BUSHES Down among the green bushes I wander away And leave the dull crowds and the City behind In the white thorns and maples I spend the green day And list to the sighs O' the soft passing wind To the sighs of the wind and the whispering leaves I think of my true love where ever I go B'neath her gown bosom her two bubbies heaves And the hue of her shoulders is whiter than snow To kiss that white shoulder her handkerchief hides I've oft longed to do so when e'en she passed bye But when she got closer I could not abide To turn to her bosom my own sheepish eye Among the green bushes I wandered and found The maid of my bosom the love o' my heart By the strings O' her apron I clasped my arms round And pressed her so closely as never to part I kissed her dear cheek i' the raptures O' bliss I pressed her sweet lips there was nothing so dear Among the green bushes I wandered alone But ne'er see my sweetheart the whole of the way Her cheek like the rose was her heart but my own How sweet in this green place to spend the whole day Beneath the green bushes I stole the sweet kiss And felt the soft pleasure for all the long year PEGGY WAS A YOUNG THING Peggy said good morning and I said good bye When Farmers dib the corn in and Ladd'y's sow the rye Young Peggy's face was common sense and I was rather shy Where I met her i' the morning when Farmers sow the rye Her half laced boots fit tightly as she tripped along the grass And she set her foot so lightly where the early bee doth pass O Peggy was a young thing her face was common sense I courted her about the spring and loved her ever since O Peggy was the young thing and bonny as to size Her lips were cherries O' the spring and hazle were her eyes O Peggy she was straight and tall as is the poplar tree Smooth as the freestone O' the wall and very dear to me O Peggy's gown was chocolate and full o cherries white I keep a bit on't for her sake and love her day and night I drest myself just like a Prince and Peggy went to woo But she's been gone some ten years since and I knew not what to do FAIR MARIA T'was in the summer time O' swallows That over hill and valley fly The wild flowers decked both hills and hollows And dappled was the summer sky When I went out to meet Maria One evening i' the month O' May The Sun set like a ball of fire And green earth's shadows round him lay The meadow wild flowers red and blue Were tipt with spangles i' the hay And blebs like spittle dripping dew Clung to their green stems all the day We wandered by the rivers tide All blue grey hung the evening cloud We kissed and cuddled side by side While the grasshoppers cherrupt loud The water skeggs flowered o'er the stream The flowering rush bloomed further in Maria saw the golden gleam That gilt the lilly's O' her skin How sweet it smiled upon the flood And on Maria's bosom pressed The resting heifer chewed her cud The crimson cloud stretched i' the west O' fair and beautiful Maria How warm thy kisses breathe on me The setting sun a ball O' fire Her beautious eyes of't turned to see I kissed her on her red rose cheek Her lips two rose buds hung wi' dew Were my delight for many a week Untill I bade the maid adieu HOW CALM IS THE EVENING How calm is the even down in the narrow lane Where white thorn and woodbine and dog roses meet How bright is the dew on the dog rose again While the grey mist creeps over like the days winding sheet O' beautiful the silver mist will hang on flowers And pearl o'er the freckles O' the fox glove bell How sweet is the stillness O' eventide hours When in the green oak leaves Ring doves do dwell To walk there with true love my sweet Mary Ann And hide by the bonny wood side In each others arms by the awthorn to stand While the Moon in the heavens doth ride While the clouds seem to sail and to race with the Moon And Mary Ann gazes on high Coal black is the cloud that envelopes it soon Till the midnight O' darkness is bye My dear Mary Ann wi' thy bonny brown hair Thy red rosy cheeks and thy bosom so white When the dew looks so sweet on the cobwebs there I'll court her and kiss her the whole of the night MY LOVE SHE IS A MODEST GIRL My love she wore a muslin cap and trim[m]ed wi' ribbons blue What time the trees were full o' sap and meadows cowslips new In meadows and on meadow banks in baulks and clover too The white horse daisy's stand in ranks all silvered wi' the dew My love she wore a pleasant gown and owned a rosy face The prettiest girl o' half the town the finest i' the place Her waist was sweet and sweet her size fleshy and fair not tall Bright as the milkmaids were her eyes her neck white as the wall A muslin cap my love had on and trimmed wi' ribbons blue When grass was green to look upon and steamed wi' morning dew Her face was like the cabbage rose her bosom lilly white Her lips are red her mild eye glows like even's dewy light My love she is a modest girl a pleasant gown she wears Her teeth are like two rows O' pearl and glossy brown her hair I feel transported by her smile and by her frown undone I'll meet her by the awthorn stile where both will seem as one THE ROSE IN FULL BEARING The rose in full bearing there is no other blossom So sweet and so flushing as that bonny flower It shines the delight O' the young maiden's bosom It's ever the sweetest in summers warm hour The beautiful rose tree how sweet its leaves blushes With dew drops like silver pearls hung on its leaves The sun light O' summer its bonny bloom flushes How sweet is its blossom on midsummer eaves T'is as sweet as the breath O' the midsum[m]er morning Where bees o'er the hay fiels are singing all day When dews like white diamonds its leaves are adorning How sweet is the full blowing rose on the spray The maiden she loves it the beautiful maiden That goes i' the meadows a milking the kye She sees the heath brere with its roses o'er laden And puts a rose bud in her bosom for joy MY LOVE SHE IS BONNY My love she is bonny and sweeter than ony rose A fairer and sweeter I never did see Her cheeks the rose bloom and grecian her fine nose And her eyes bright as dew drops upon the rose tree The woodbines the hedge roses blooming Not brighter and sweeter than Hellen can be Her face is a fair one her eye is a rare one As bright as the dew drops upon the rose tree O' beautiful Hellen I pass by thy dwelling Where lilly's and roses and streaky woodbine O'er her windows are blooming in summers perfuming And beautiful Hellen has sworn to be mine FAREWELL TO THE CORNFIELD Farewell to the cornfield and meadow so green Farewell to the white thorn and willow and Jean Farewell to the haunts O' her childhood and mine Where green banks had peace and my Jean looked divine W'ere parted and may be for ever we part Still Jeanie shall be the choice girl of my heart Farewell to the cornfield and meadow so green Farewell to the white thorn and willow and Jean The meadows will be just as green when I'm gone To the eyes o' my Jean while my heart like a stone Lies cold in my breast while the scene I survey To think of to-morrow that bears me away From all I once loved and am cherishing yet The wild flowers O' summer wi' honey dews wet The path o'er the meadows the style i' the lane My Jeanie will see them and know them again To the wide roaring ocean and fathomless brine I wander my Jean where thou still may be mine If thy heart it be true love mine still thou shalt be Though I perish by shipwreck and drown i the Sea So farewell green meadows and farewell my Jean To the willow and thorn where together we've been All lonely I go to the wide raving sea But true love will bring me safe back unto thee BONNY MARY O The morning opens fine bonny Mary O The Robin sings his song by the dairy O While the little Jenny Wrens cock their

cock crows the crows return from far On heath and meadow I sojourn the warm sun bids good bye I wait my lassie's glad return in fetching O the kye On bramble brere the dew bleb dips as bright as siller gems And moisters green grasshoppers lips on clover's hairy stems I lye upon the grassy knoll where bents and blossoms lye And see my lassie's mountain stroll in fetching up the kye The muircock whinies to its nest The partridge seeks the corn The plover wi' its snow white breast Screems loudly e'en and morn I lye agen the bramble bush A light step fans the pliant rush The lass wha' seeks the kye How peaceful lies yon mountain cloud How sweet grey mist the valley shroud The red across the blue and small flowers blebed wi' dew O bonny is her rosy cheek and bright her beaming eye The bonny lass that a the week comes out to fetch the kye Her hair is like the thunder clouds Aboon Benlomons brow Her voice is sweet her gait not proud She charms I can't tell how When glass the broad lakes lie I kiss her in the bracken green When coming for the kye WHEN I MEET A BONNY LASSIE When I meet a bonny lassie My heart burns in my breast And a little further passes She robs me of all rest I think of her all night and I think of her all day Whom my path met in delight Among the meadow hay The downy bents all talk it That pat agen my hose And the bees they winna balk it That a honey hunting goes They sing it on the blossom They sing it in the grass How my heart fled from my bosom When I met the blushing lass I met her in a pleasant place Mong burnet buttons many She had a round and rosey face And seemed more sweet than any My heart seemed burnt to crall at all, My heart turned icy pale And graceful bowed the feathered reed And swept the southern gale I met her in the narrow path No room for two to pass The butterfly it pleasures hath To fly about the grass I could not fly but lightly pressed scarce treading in the hay A look upon her gown I cast which stole my vacant eyes away When I met the bonny lassie My heart burnt through my breast And passed her in the king-cups brassy I lost both thought and rest I think upon her half the day And all the live long night The cockle and the rye looks gay But I'm a wretched wite I MET A PLEASANT MAIDEN On the seventeenth of April I' the good year forty nine I met a pleasant maiden And I wished the maid was mine She'd cowslips in her basket She'd sweet briar in her hand Her love I would have ask'd But she would not understand I touched her gown in passing And she looked in strange surprise The meadow pool spread glassing In the beautiful sunrise Her shall was of the flags so green Her gown was brown and red Her stockings white as snow was seen And lightsome was her tread The linnet chirrupt in the thorn the lark sung in the sky And bonny was the sunny morn And every road was dry I took [her] by the waist so [small] All in a pleasant place She no denial made at all But smiled upon my face I cuddled her in the green grass And sat among the hay Till sunshine o'er the hill did pass And day light went away I kissed [her] o'er her bonny face So tender and so true And left my blessing on the place Among the foggy dew I MAYBE CANNA SING I may be canna sing But I mun up, and try a verse or two For a bonny lass has wandered bye Wi' eyes as bright as morning dew Wi' bosom white as lammies wool Whi' cheeks as red as rose brere Could I that rosey kiss obtain I'd get my hearts own wishes here The bramble bush is a in flower The linnet busy with her young Leading them in the white thorn bower Where lone hedge sparrows loudly sung A bonny maiden in her prime As ever eyes did wish to see Ann Bodenham queen of rural rhyme That dwells beside the river Lea In brown silk gown she passed me bye As bonny as the blooms O May I felt as I was like to die And sighed but had no word to say Her voice was just as music speaks Her lips were rubies wet wi' dew I thought of her for many weeks And loved her tenderly and true Ann Bodenham on the river Lea, To me seemed all the world in one My heart on fire appeared to be Then turned to ice when she was gone I loved her dear throughout the year Where she was not no peace could be She was my own my only dear Ann B[o]denham on the River Lea BEAUTIFUL MARIA The setting sun it gilds wi' gold And village windows blazes now While beauty's o' the finest mould Walk the green hills grassy brow The bramble bends wi' drops O' pearl The silver daisy's turn to green And beautifull the lovely girl That on those lone[l]y hills was seen Maria beautifull Maria The hum[m]ing bee the glossy fly From sun set to their homes retire And leave thee to thy evening joy Beaded wi' dew the zephers wing Blows coolly on thy neck so fair Perked up thy wild flower blossoms spring And join wi thee the cooler air The jiant canterberry bell The sultan with its husky flowers Close by her evening rambles dwell Rich wi' the evenings dewey hours My loved and beautifull Maria What happiness the boon would gie Close by thy side at days retire Might I thy loved companion be 'TIS NOW THE HIGHT O' SUMMER Tis now the height o summer And where so e'er I turn my eyes The woods do nought but murmer And the hedge rows swarm wi' flies On dry banks the whasps are busy Wi' yellow jackets and sharp stings Summer's a secret dirty hussy And nothing like primrosey spring Then leaf strewn woods are greenest And full of wild primroses The calm green air serenest On moss nests the Bird reposes Then by the spinny rails The violet smells so sweet Loading with perfumes all the gales And wild bees yellow feet Hot summer is a dirty hussey Swarming o'er wi' wasps and flies That by wood sides are ever busy Wi' their burning melodies Give me the spring wi' foot paths clean The finches nest and budding tree The primrose in its leaves so green And 'neath white thorn I'll happy be HOW BEAUTIFUL THE MORNING How beautifull the morning blue And light o' nearly grey Each herb and flower is wet wi' dew Where toil begins the day The crimson curtains o' the sky Already turns to dun And burning over herds o' kye The skylark hails the sun A ball O' fire he blazes high Till bulgeing clouds succeeds The coal black snails that fire to fry Now creep beneath the weeds The blue black mountain clears away And levels into dun And peering in the pearl blue day High mounts the firey sun The sun soon mounts the midway sky The sudden shower comes on On blade and flower the pearl drops lye A sun in every one O'er mountain top it goes to bed In crimson gold and dun And tips with fire the mountains head The firey setting sun MANY DEAR THINGS There's mony dear things i' the land we live in To make us more happy then other folks are There's bonny wee Bessy the pride O her kin Her cheeks are sae red and her bosom so fair O' bonny wee Bessy to cuddle and bless thee And i' arm for caress thee How sweet wud it be in the warm summer air To kiss bonny Bessy that sweet bonny lass Wi' my arm round her shoulder my lips on her chin While sitting beside her O' dear what a puther my heart it was in O' bonny wee Bessy A arm for caress thee Among the sweet hay grass How dear has it bin The morning is lovely my sweet bonny maid On the side O the mountain how blooms the wild brere As sweet as young Bessy it grows i the shade Where for stealing my heart O' I kissed her so dear The bonny young Bessey not showey or dressy Mid' a blush 'neath her tresses Cry'd ‘for shame’ as she cropped off a rose from the brere THE GARDENERS BONNY DAUGHTER The chaffinch in the hedge row sings In the brown naked thorn And by its tail the titmouse hings Searching the buds at morn And I'll wish dirty roads away And meadows flooded water And court before I end the day The gardeners bonny daughter She's sweeter than the first o' spring More fair than Christmas roses When robins by the hovel sing Sweet smiles the maid discloses Her hair so brown her eye so bright As clear as the spring water I'll go and have a word tonight With the gardeners bonny daughter Her cheeks are like the coloured rose A kiss would surely burn ye Her lips are gems more red than those For love I'll go the journey And when the white thorn comes in leaf And the chaffinch lays her lauter I walk where singing birds are brief Wi' the gardeners bonny daughter I passed the gardeners house one night My heart burnt to a cynder When I saw her face and eyes so bright A looking through the window And when I'd passed the house agen I'd been pounded in a mortar But she looked and smiled upon me then So I love the gardeners bonny daughter WILL YOU EVER LOVE ME DEAREST? And will you ever love me dearest Yes by the heavens above thee By soul breathed sighs and love sincerest I will for ever love thee Love words will burn before they're spoken Heart thoughts no tongue can tell The heart will bleed before its broken And I love Hellen well As o'er the pebbles flows the water Gilt by the glittering beam I love thee as earths fairest daughter In many a happy dream I saw thee in each rushy hollow When rushes arched in dew And then pursued thee like a swallow Far under heavens blue And I will ever love thee dearest Now and for ever love thee The brook below thy

to cheer the maid Wi' waters roundelay I play the tunes to please myself And love her while I play And think she likes my songs as well The lovely Alice Grey She's fairer than the mountain flowers More bright than peep o' day She's sweeter than the e'eing hours when day light goes away There's naething like her sees the light Nought seen by night or day That's half so beautiful and bright As lovely Alice Grey I see her in the morning sky Just at the break of day When happy fancies fill my eye Wi' visions fair and gay She's mair to me than all beside The summer fades away But every green in beauty's pride Is handsome Alice Grey THE EVENING IS FOR LOVE The evening is for love As the morning is for toil Though the fire is from above The pot is got to boil A hard days work is mine And I'll live wi' care no more So I'll see dew come to the woodbine at Isabella's door Wi' hairy leaves and dro[o]ping flowers The canterberry bell Grows underneath [the] hazle bower By most folks favoured well Up the bean stalks creeps the snail The moth sleeps down below The grey mist creep[s] along And I'll a courting go I'll gang and Isabella see Nor more i' love repine By her yard gates the elder tree By her door the streaked woodbine And red pink bunches on the bed And pansies blue and yellow The west is gloweing gold and red And I'll gang to Isabella I'll court her a' the lee lang night And to-morrow being Sunday I'll rap her in my hearts delight And uggle her till Monday Her bosom is so fair and white she never had a fellow I'll gang and stay till broad day light Wi my handsome Isabella I'LL GANG AND SEE JESSY AGAIN When daylight is bidding bye And the green oats feel clammy to touch True love gies a sweet o' the joy I care not but little or much When the sun hides behind the grey willows And the green woods turn black i' the glen When beauty goes sleep on her pillows I'll gang and see Bessey agen The grey mist creeps o'er the valley The hue o' the grey willow row The brook in its speed seems to dally And black is the bark o' the sloe There's calmness below and above me The lovers star shines i' the glen There's one in my eye that might love me So I'll go and see Bessie agen There's love i' the calm o' the bushes The rush bed the leveret has prest On their nests sit the blackbirds and thrushes The fire cloud streaks red i' the West I' the oak by the road roosts the blue dove The moon mounts o'er woods i' the glen I clap the gate ‘come to your true love’ And there I'll kiss Bessie agen [The winter winnowed chill And fast came down the snow] The winter winnowed chill And fast came down the snow T'was white on every hill In rucks the drift did blow When a bonny Irish maiden Came barefoot throug[h] the Snow HER LOVE IS ALL TO ME O' cold is the winter day And iron is the ground And winters snow has found his way For fifty miles around I turn a look to every way And nothing to be seen The frozen clouds shuts out the day And snow hide[s] all the green The hedges all of leaves are bare my heart beats cold &amp; chill O' once I loved a pretty girl and love her dearly still Though love is but a frozen pearl as you may plainly see My lovely girl is handsome as any maid can be Freeze on the bitter biteing sky Snows shade the naked tree All desolate alone am I Yet I'll love none but thee No tears I shed my love to show To freeze before they fall No sighs I send along the snow But she's my all in all The footpath leaves the ruts and carts O'er furrow and o'er rig And my love lives at the ‘White hart’ a stone throw from the brig She's like a ballad sung in tune And deep in love to be Her face is like the rose in June And her love is all to me MY BONNY JANE The cows are from the pasture gone The sheep are bleating in the pen The path they travelled one by one Is o'er the fallows beat agen The sparrow chelps along the eaves The whasp hums in the window pane And I'll of labour take my leave And gang and court young bonny Jane The plums are misted o'er wi' dew And rosey streaks the apples wear But Jinney's cheeks a sweeter hue Than either apple plumb or pear The sun sinks o'er the willows grey And clammy got the fields o' grain And at her own home ends that day I kissed the lips O bonny Jane Her dark [hair] hangs in parted curl Aside her forehead white as snow She seemed a maid [of] other worlds Too fair for any thing below We stood beside the turnpike way Such meetings seldom come again That piece of animated clay I clasped and kissed young bonny Jane The mallow looked like satin flowers Cut by some fond and fairy queen The nettle fit for garden bowers Did no where look so richly green They cant' be common nettles sure I said and stooped to look again But love stood there blind eyes to cure My ain sweet fairy bonny Jane The bee resumed its honey tone around And searched the alloes bloom The windows too were open thrown For buzing whasps to leave the room Her hair was lappit in a comb Then twisted glossy round again That sweet white bosome was loves home O my ain dear bonny Jane The hens had clockit up to bed The chicks where yet within the pen The sparrows from the wheatfields sped To Jinney's mossy eaves agen O' Jinney is the bonny flower The severest parting pain Wi' many a vow and promise fair I kissed and left my bonny Jane The sun set red the weary crow Flew homeward to the woods agen The willows grey waved too and fro And dews fell like a misty rain She threw her kerchief o'er her hair Her fond kiss cured the parting pain Wi' many a vow and promise fair I kissed and left my bonny Jane THE MILKING O' THE KYE The wagtail flies about wi' her snow white throat And the robin sings at even by the old pig stye By the time the pigeons are all in the caute And Peggy up the homestead is bringing up the kye The little merry bluecap pops i' the old barn wall And the old crow on her nest in the old pollard tree The swallow swithers past and the cuckoo gies a call When I stand by Peggy milking and none kens me O' Peggy[s] like an angel wi' out a wing to flee And Peggy's like a young thing and her feet are very small Peggy's got a small hand [and] fairer will she be When she gets a twelvemonth older she'll fairly beat them all As fair as the oak apples upon the pollard tree Is Peggy's cheek and chin and bright her hazle eye Where the wren has built her nest Eve's star is oe'r the shed I gang to love young Peggy at the milking o' the kye The robin sings his song on the old rig tree The wren he bears him company upon the bonny brere They are two little birds as happy as can be And they come and sing o' Sundays the whole of the year They come and sing o' Sundays to Peggy and to me And the robin drops him down wi' his coal black eye A pretty perk bird Peggy dearly loved to see And litters him some crumbs at the milking o the kye O' its happiness to feel in a bumbarrel's nest And to look on the hedgesparrows eggs pearl blue And its more than pleasant when the sun is in the west A walking out wi' Peggy the grass before the dew To kiss her bonny cheek and her lilly neck to clasp And look for little babys in the sparkling of her eye From her proud sunday bonnet to drive away the whasp And stand behind and kiss her at the milking o the kye I MET HER IN THE GLOAMING Twas at the hours o evening when low descends the dew When the ring dove seeks the pollard oak and lays a stick or two And lays her two white eggs aye whiter than the snow And feeds her young i' golden down from the green peafield below It was a pleasant evening and the brook in silver moans Sang its evening song under grass and over stones Among the pasture whins I will seek for Sally now Where hangs the red cheeked apple upon the oak tree bough I'll meet her when the western cloud burns crimson i' the sky And leaves her mop agen the door and gangs to meet the kye When the bramble hangs on drops by the old lane side And the' evening star is shineing o'er the black woods far and wide When the daisy turns a bud and the lark is on her nest When the babe is in the cradle or on the Mothers breast I bide me i' the gloaming and down the green path hie And meet my bonny sweetheart at the milking o' the kye I met her in the gloaming it was but Sunday e'en Blue ribbons on her white straw hat her bonny gown was green I kissed her bonny cheek and chin and nipped her rosy arms Frae milking to the gloaming I feasted on her charms And now where fin weeds are in flower and the wild thyme scents the plain I'll gang to night to Sally and [kiss] her o'er again The moth is on the keksies on the teazle sleep[s] the Flye And I'll gang the dewy e'ening where Sally milks the kye COME NANNY DEAR NEAR ME Come Nanny lie near me Thy talk it will cheer me I'm o'er happy to hear thee Talk close to

that makes the chimeing bells I never more forget The hedge row ash the story tells The place where first we met O' Sally cans't thou think of me While nature round thee lies Here where we met I ever see Thy large and bright blue eyes I worship thee in many rhymes Where that place I see I kiss that face a thousand times In fancy's fond and free O Sally Mason lovely girl The cowslips on the leas

lovely girl Thy love is all to me Every flower I set my face on is nought compared to thee Here I press thy snow bosom And neck more white than snow Sally's a flower near out O' blossom The sweetest in the world below THE EVENING WAS WET The evening was wet and the twilight was cold And loud were the bleat O the sheep frae the fold When up cam a sodgerman younger than auld His face war' red his jacket blue Wi' red cuffs and collar he sat himself down He looked in my face and he fired out a rown' Up lassie and bring me a quart o' the brown And I did the order fu' time He drank to me the weary

drunk as fell dere And sang oud sangs tegether My Willies coat was blue and red That night he had my maiden head Beneath the eldern bye the shed And now were in loves tether THE RED ROBIN Cock Robin he got a neat tippet at spring And he sat in a shed and heard other birds sing And he whistled a ballad as loud as he could And built him a nest of oak leaves by the wood And furnished it just as the celadine pressed Like a bright burning blaze by the edge o' its nest All glittering with sunshine and beautiful rays Like high polished brass or the fire in a blaze Then sung a new song on the bend o' the brere And so it kept singing the whole of the year Till cowslips and wild roses blossomed and died The red Robin sung by the old spring side THE SNOWDEN MAID The autumn is come and the fields are a ble[a] The spring is severe the tempest sharp And hail stones rattle i' the gale And I will wreath[e] around my harp The violet and the primrose pale The bonny snowden maid to hail The day's scarce fit to go abroad in yet will I sing and never fail The young and bonny maid O' snowden She wears in her raven hair They're shaded in her bonny eye The primrose is her kerchief fair Her gown's the

Snowden THE SHIP CHARLOTTE Our good ship the Charlotte for battle was bound Her guns were well mounted her timbers were sound Our crew were as gallant as sailors could be When our new ship the Charlotte was sent out to sea Her cannons three hundred all mounted [and] man'd The best ship of war that the navy e're planned To North Carolina was bound for a trip This brave lot of Tars and this beautiful Ship Tho' high as a castle in motion as brave She danced like a bird on the swell of the wave And all her brave crew in tracking her foes Looked for smoak as a hound tracks fox by the nose Her journey was bound o'er the ocean afar And rigged out for battle a bold man O' war Her deck was strong timbered her seamen were brave When the new Royal Charlotte's wake furrowed the wave She opened her guns when we hailed her on shore And the banks of the sea was their bulwarks no more They were plowed by her guns till as low as the land Where America's army for battle did stand When they shyed from our guns we soon drag'd them ashore And gave them a cheering with one volley more Till the balls fell so thick that away they did run And struck their land flag to the new Charlott's gun Here's a health to brave Charlotte the queen of the deep In the dews of the morning we left them to weep We hoisted her colours and sailed away back And Freedom's sun spangled the waves on our track Gave rest to the night and delight to the day While grog, songs, and music made shorter the way Here's a health to the Charlotte we'll drink it again For the sea is her Empire and long may she reign THE WINDS BLOW SOFTLY The winds blow softly strong And the trees are tossed about And we scarce can hear the Song or sound the lark is pipeing out In the sky above the wind Where we hear them not so loud I' the roar and thunder joined And the ever racing cloud The bushes toss like waves And the woods like thunder roar Wi' their green and yawning graves To the pastures rushy shore Yet it passes like a lover I' the summer's warm embrace As soft while passing over As loves kisses on the face How fresh it makes the maiden how soft her drapery swims Her cheeks wi' rosey's laden How round her lovely limbs It lays her ancles bare and wins a thousand ways What swelling calves are there Which the courting wind betrays How soft it waves the willows How smooth it bows the grass Green undulating billows And flowers like bits O' glass Her neckerchief flap[s] up And bares her shoulder white The daiseys where the lambs heaks up Is nothing ne'er so bright THEE I LOVE BONNY LASSIE O Thee I love and ever will bonny Lassie O Let us gang up maple hill bonny Lassie O While the thrush is singing there And the oakwood darken fair Hasten and meet me there bonny Lassie O Corn bottles more than blue bonny Lassie O And corn poppies scarlet hue bonny Lassie O And the rose and the wild brere Crowds wi' blooms and summer here So gang up maple hill bonny Lassie O Sky larks are in the air bonny Lassie O The brook rins o'er pebbles fair bonny Lassie O On its banks we'll love so chaste Wi' my arms about thy waist So come up maple hill bonny Lassie O When the blackbird's on her nest bonny Lassie O Wi the morn dew on her breast bonny Lassie O Come a milking by the hills And we'll [sit] and love our fill By the rutty rifted road bonny Lassie O By the bonny white thorn bush bonny Lassie O Where hides the linnet and the thrush bonny Lassie O When the mist is on the Pea I will sit and uggle thee Wi' my arms about thy neck bonny Lassie O HOUSE OR WINDOW FLIES These little indoor dwellers in cottages These little indoor dwellers in cottages and halls, were always entertaining to me, after dancing in the window all day from sunrise to sun-set they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the sugar, and be welcome all summer long, they look like things of mind or fairries, and seemed pleased or dull as the weather permits in many clean cottages, and genteel houses, they are allowed every liberty to creep, fly, or do as they like, and seldom or ever do wrong, in fact they are the small or dwarfish portion of our own family, and so many fairy familiars that we know and treat as

BONNY IS THE COUNTRY Tis Autumn wild the swim[m]ing clouds Pass low and lowery o'er the green The swopping kite peelews aloud And sparrows in the stubbs are seen Mid hawkweed flowers on sunday's hours I lye by Besseys side Her arm sae white her eyes sae bright Brought every joy beside The awe tree berries clustered brown The wilding apples green and sour Her well shaped fingers pulled them down While courting in that autumn hour Sparrows a crowd i' Stubbs chirped loud The partridge covey flew O'er her bonnet crown where we sat down On the grass yet moist wi' dew O' bonny was the country girl While the brooklet at her feet Curled up the pebbles white as pearl And hawthorns looked so sweet Hung o'er its way and willows grey Swayed gently by the wind The fetches blue and bell bind too Did in the white thorn bind The sun it gleamed both bright and warm And sparkled in wild flowers The gnats were dancing in a swarm And gleamy grew the hours The butterfly and bee whissed by Loud sung the grasshopper Save larks i' the cloud all sang so loud As each one sung to her I 'pilled the straws for want o' words And plucked up bents to plait And thought while there the loving birds Had ne'er so sweet a mate Her white straw hat o' smallest plait And green striped cotton gown Her hiloes bright her stockings white She on the grass sat down O' bonny Bessey wi' dark hair And face as round's a apple Wi' lilly bosom half way bare Which blue veins richly dapple Thy pouting lips like mellow hips Thy neck hair short and curled I clasped the[e] there sae sweet a fair The angel o the world A

and shoulders thundering through Roars, howls and stifled murmurs never cease Hell and its agonies seems hid below Thick rolls the mist that smokes and falls in dew The trees and greensward wear the

Mary the maid o' the plough I feel such a something I cannot tell how The flowers i' the grass and the leafs on the bough And its a for young Mary the maid o' the plough O she is my wee thing my lone

thee from morning to night And every half hour O' the day Thou'rt nought but my love and delight Though all the while absent from me Thy cheeks are as red as a rose Thy eyes are like sparkles O' fire Thou'rt a queen in thy holliday clothes My bonny young Ann Maria THE WALK LAST SABBATH DAY I took a walk last sabbath day In my best sunday suit I passed a maiden on the way She stooped to tie her boot She looked so beautiful she did And she was all alone Thick arms and shape light drapery hid Turned both my eyes to stone O what a breast her bosom wore That when [she] stooped hung down Whiter and bigger than before The fairest i the Town And had unpin'd abin her gown The red runned from out her stayes Like croodie on the grass so brown Or lodged at her Shoe taes She looked so sweet I forced to stop The blush up ears and eyes She seemed too heavy at the top Unable all to rise And where her boot lace came undone A purple orchis grew I saw it in the evening sun And in the morning dew I saw't o evenings i' the week Each sunday i' the year And purposed journeys came to seek When orchis flowers appear O they are clods that never seek For true loves living powers When beans grow up as green as leeks I hunt the Orchis flower I LOVED THE LASSES DEARLY I loved the Lasses dearly When I wad'nt but a boy They seemed angels all or nearly And everlasting joy When I sat among the rushes By the path where maidens came Their gowns brushed by the white thorn bushes And set my heart on flame Their eyes looked bright and warm When warmly gleamed the weather And each one left me such a charm I'd kissed them altogether I sat me down where green the grass is In sunshine and the blast And there I dearly loved the lasses Aye every one that past And when I saw the valley flower Shook by bees flying near 'em She left her eye in that sweet hour But loves voice woud'n't hear him And when she stooped down further on for flowers love burnt to give her I loved where the rose was gone her face was fair for ever WHEN THE SLOE FLOWER'S IN BLOOM When the sloe f[l]owers in bloom upon March's chill bosom And the newly dropt lambkins lie chill on the plain I think about Songs and I want to compose 'em For sweet at the evening is my bonny Jane Her bosom's as soft as the down O the thistle Like the head O the red cap her red cheeks remain A fig for your pearls and your jewels gae whistle There's nothing but nature can equal my Jane Her smiles are as rich as the hues O' her bosom And that is as white as the mountain O snow I want but the scrap of a Song to compose 'em To make about Jenny and sing as I go Down the vales and wood rideings a' blistered wi dew Where the foxglove hangs pendant in ribbed hazle leaves To speak O' her beauty and sing't a true Loves song O' simplicity never deceives She's the pink O' carnations The dove O creation Both artless and fair is the choice O' my ain In beauty she's winning her heart's free frae sinning I took her frae thousands to love her alane The sparrow cheeps loud o'er her door i' the e'ening While her apron she takes to the bee on the pane To give him his freedom where queen stocks are leaning There is naething sae luvley as my bonny Jane THE BALM O CARE IS WOMAN How pleasant is the evening walk With one kind hearted Lassie How pleasant is a womans talk In places green and grassy The salt of life the balm o care Is woman to man ever They live the fairest of the fair And leave them will I never Theres raptures in their bright bright eyes The flowers hang drops O dew Their faces and their talk I prize—I love and kiss them through I kiss them through their cheeks O roses I kissed them through their lips and eyes They're all that happiness supposes In them the art of pleasing lies I DREAM'T OF ROBIN I opened the casement this morn at star light And the moment I got out O' bed The daisies were quakeing about in their white And the cowslip was nodding its head The grass was all shivers the stars were all bright And Robin that should cam at e'en I thought that I saw him a gaist by moon light Like a stalking horse stands on the green I went bed agen and did nothing but dream Of Robin and moon light and flowers He stood like a shawdow transfixed by a Stream and I could'n't forget him for hours I'd just dropt asleep when I dreamed Robin spoke And the casement it gave such a shake As if every pane i' the window was broke Such a patter the gravel did make So I up i' the morning before the cock crew And to strike a light I sat down I saw from the door all his track i' the dew And I guess called ‘come in and sit down’ And sure enough tramples up to the door And who but young Robin is sen' And ere the old folks were half willing to stir We met kissed and parted agen THE DAISY BUTTON TIPP'D WI' DEW The daisy button tipped wi' dew Green like the grass was sleeping On every thing 'neath heaven blue In moonlight dew was weeping In dark wood sung the Nightingale The moon shone round above me My arms were clasped round Mary Gale My dearest do you love me Her head a woodbine wet wi' dew Held in the moonlight sleeping And two in one together grew Wi' daisy buds a weeping O' Mary Gale sweet Mary Gale How round and bright above thee The moon looks down on grassy vale My dearest can you love me How sweet the moonlight sleeps and still Firdale and hedge row brere The mole wharps mound and distant hill Is moonlight every where The totter grasses pendalums Are still as night above me The bees are gone and nothing hums My dearest do you love me The moonlight sleeps o'er wood and wall Sweet Mary While you'r nigh me Can any charm O' courtship fail And any joy pass by me The gossamer all wet wi' dew Hung on the brere above me She leaned her cheek and said ‘I do’ And ever mean to love thee WILL

Will ye gang a weeding dear I' the green and juicey year Will ye go a weeding wheat Sit on the green dinner seat Where the wild thyme smells sae sweet Will ye gang a weeding dear Heres the John go bed

morning I' the month of warm July The sun green meads adorning And lovely looked the sky Hay cocks bleached on the grass And some lay in the swath When by a neat and lovely lass Went down the meadow path My pretty maid good morning You've brought a charming day Good morn she said not scorning What more I had to say Through rustling flags and arrowhead The water wavered by Light was the bonny maidens tread And sharp her quick reply At my request the maid sat down Among the knop weed flowers The sun had tanned her bosom brown And sultry were the hours She sat her down upon the grass Where crickets chirped loud She was a young and bonny lass Her cheeks with roses glowed You've won my heart my dear said I, As I sat at her feet Red was her lip and bright her eye The hay smelt very sweet I clasped her by the neck so soft Like heap of burning twitch The water rats were nibbling sedge The moon light hour was rich The willow tree its shadow flings Like brigs across the stream The owl his hooting ditty sings Her bosom white as cream I kissed she took the homeward track Along the meadow ground “Good night” upon my ear came back In natures sweetest sound OH ONCE I HAD A TRUE LOVE O' once I had a true love And I loved her very well Untill she got a new love For my wish I could not tell When Absent I talked to her And when she might have heard Thinking silence best could woo her I passed without a word I hid me from her sight And I hid me from her thoughts too I lost my relish for delight And vainly studdied ways to woo I thought she saw my heart beat My waistcoat seemed to heave and stir My eyes that others used to cheat Was ever fond and true to her She saw me quake unheeding My eyes they watered dim The flower ‘True love lies bleeding’ Could never talk for him I thought she saw my legs shake She never spoke a word I thought she saw my hands quake Though her hands they never stirred We silent stood together And we passed without a word In spring and winter weather was nothing seen or heard I thought to send a letter But I never wrote a line Another time seemed better To ask her to be mine But ‘another time’ was absent No silence love could prove No word was spoke no line was sent And so I lost my love AGAIN I'LL TAKE MY INK AND PEN Agen I'll take my idle pen And sing my bonny mountain maid Sweet Phebe O' the scottish glen Nor of her censure feel afraid I'll charm her ear with beautys praise And please her eye wi songs agen The ballads of our early days to Phebe O' the Scottish glen There never was a fairer thing All Scotlands glens and mountains through The siller gowans O the spring Vei'd o'er wi' pearls O mountains dew The maiden blushed upon the brere Far distant frae the haunts O' men Is nothing half so sweet and dear As Phebe O' the Scottish glen How handsome is her naked foot Moist wi the pearls O' summer dew The siller daisy's nothing to't Nor awthorn flowers so white to view She's sweeter than the blooming brere That blooms sae far away frae men N'ae flower i Scotland bent sae dear As Phebe O' the Scottish glen SHE'S LOVELY IN HER PERSON She's lovely in her person And taller in her size Then some bards make a verse on And lovely are her eyes She's worth a Poets ransome She chills my heart on fire Her face is very handsome And warm as my desire O' beautifull is woman In her secret love for Man Like flowers eternal blooming And I'll win her if I can I'll win her and I['ll] wear her Like a nose gay on the breast And on my heart I'll bear her Like a nosegay sweetly prest She shall be mine for ever And that I'm sure she shall And a pleasant kiss I'll give her As a sweet and lovely girl Her cheeks are like two roses And her lips are ruby red And whatever truth supposes I should like her downy bed Her cheeks are bonny roses And auburn is her hair Her eye as dark as sloes is Her neck is lilly fair She's love among the roses When the leaves wear morning gems Her bosom white as snows is Her eyes two diadems To conquor and to kill ye If ye worship them too long And will ye love or will ye She's the sweetest girl in Song OH PHOEBE LOVELY PHOEBE O' Phebe lovely Phebe meet me in the hills O' gorse We'll sit upon wild thyme so sweet And loves soft joys engross Round thy white neck my arm shall fall Thy hand pressed close in mine While wheat ears in the bushes catch And whitethroats sing divine I'll kiss thy lips so softly prest And wait thy kind replys And lean upon thy snowy breast And look love in thine eyes My arm shall clasp thee round the waist Thy hand still held in mine And nothing but ideas chaste Shall meet those ears of thine The heather with its knol[l]s O' bloom Shall rustle by thy feet And home the pettichap shall come To its nest beside thy seat And bonnily thy gown shall fold Wi' the soft summer wind And sweet shall shine the hills O' gold Wi furze brigh[t] blossomed lined O' Phebe lovely Phebe dear In each others arms we'll lye And rich shall smell the wild sweet Brere And sweet shall low the kye We'll lye till evening claims the sun Behind the furze clad hill And when our day of cortship's done I'll meet and worship still PRIMROSES IN THE WOOD APPEAR Primroses in the woods appear Their sulphur coloured flowers Are the wan heralds of the year In March's varying hours And by the mossy hedge they spring In sulphur shining bloom What time the thrush begins to sing And sallow catkins come Beneath the white thorn vivid green How beautiful they look Maple and hazle bush beturns Beside the gulphing brook How sweetly shine the fairey flowers Near gravel paved streams Foretelling Aprils dewy showers As rich as Julias dreams Green linnets peck the pated flowers In March's kindling vest I'll crop some blooms in these wild hours For Julia's happy breast VIOLETS AND PRIMROSES When violets and primroses bloom on the plain How happy on Sundays I walk with my swain Down the mossy wood side And the fields white thorn quick Where the brook flows so clear And the flowers grow so thick There's the curly wool'd lambs with their lilly white skin Keep running their races while none of them win The cowslip breaks off from their feet where they run And lies on the ground till its killed by the sun Now they lye neath the ash tree that stays not the sun But stops out the wind they are anxious to shun And sleep where the violets are smelling so sweet On the bank by the hedge in the suns pleasant heat Where violets and primroses bloom on the plain How happy on Sundays I walk with my swain When the curl coated lambs at their gambol's are seen O'er the greensward that spring warms and kindles to green THE SUN IS SETTING The sun is a setting The dews they are wetting The grass in the meadow And down the green lane The clouds sail more lowly and travel on slowly To the top O' the mountain and over the main Leaving the hedges and bushes full soon To the sleep O' the night and the light O' the moon Alone in the gloaming Where beauty is roaming Along the green lane by the light O' the moon Wi bonny breast heaving Sweet dreams she is weaving In hopes that her lover may meet with her soon Boughs stir as a bird hurries into its nest And the thoughts of her lover leap up in her breast She passes the wild brere Where bowing the mild ear Tans brown for the harvest all misted wi dew The birds in the bushes The larks in the rushes And the tall clumps of teazles and thistles red blue The sun set is hurled To the edge of the world Like a millstone red hot out O' night to return Now it waxes all dim And its uppermost rim Is all that is seen O' that circle O' fire The maiden walks lonely With her love and that only Amused with the moonlight and shadows of eve Night and day all are blooming In nature and woman For both are truths pleasures and nothing to grieve THE DAYS OF APRIL On the return of April some few days Before it comes when every thing looks new And woods where primroses burn in a blaze Of fire And sallows in the woods made new Seen blazeing out in blossoms not a few But bushes smothered over what a change Is turned upon their brightness passing by The very birds the pies and crows and Jays Look downward on their bloom from dark trees high And wood larks dropping from the rich blue sky Winner and whistle to their very roots Sitting beneath a canophy of gold And wood anemonies the sharp air suits Their sheltered blooms with beauties manifold Daisies burn April grass with silver flies And pilewort in the green lane blazes out Enough to burn the fingers neath the briars Where village Boys will scrat dead leaves about To look for pootys—every eye admires The lovely pictures that the spring brings out Meadows of bowing cowslips what mind tires To see them dancing in the emerald grass And trawling chrystal brook as clear as glass Laughing groaning uggling on for miles That waves the silver blades of swimming grass Upon the surface while the glad sun smiles Such are the sights the showers and sunshine bring To three or four bright days in the first of spring The sun shines in days heaven a bright light All gold and glorious beautiful and fair Spanning all ether in a day all bright With beams as glowing as an angels hair While clouds blue ether beautiful ye are Light spans ye like a dome with a Earth ocean and the infinite blue air Which the Almighty's presence cir[c]les round With might immensity that knows no bound THE RETURN OF SPRING What was expected is expected more As the days lengthen and the sun gets warm Wild flowers will gather to the cottage door Daisey and pilewort and about the farm The young lambs skip and dance on the green floor And pewets scream upon the neighbouring moor Cowslips in crowds that never yet was seen The meadows and green close is smothered o'er And every place where winters blight hath been Is all repaired by spring in gold and green How lovely green and level meadows lye Filling with flowers of spring day following day How bright the lakes how beautifull the sky With Harry Phillips re[a]d and fled to play On the clear streams in the green month of May How beautiful green golden days go by Fish can't refuse the bait in such warm days Such flowery meadows and so sweet a sky And then a shower dimpling the stream melts by MY LOVE SHE WAS A GIPSEY O My love she was a Gipsey O The brown and bonny Gipsey O She fortunes told from town to town And sometimes she got tipsey O Her face was brown as is the ground Her eyes are two eclipses The sun is fixed the rest go round She's the sun O' the gipseys O A gipsey lass my love was born Among the heaths furze bushes O More fair than Lady's on the lawn Whose song is like the thrushes O Like links O' snakes her inky hair The dandy beau she kisses O Her face round as an apple fair She blisters where she kisses O Her ancle slim as lady's zone A mill post swells the calf o't Her merry heart might be my own Could I but steal the half O't My love she is a gipsey O A brown and bonny gipsey O What e'er betide the life to come I'll ne'er forsake my gipsey O THE CORN CRAIKS RISPY SONG The corncraik rispt her summer call Just as the sun went down Copper red a burning ball In woods behind the town I wandered forth a maid to meet So bonny and so fair No other flower was half so sweet And cole black was her hair Upon the grasses stood the dew Bead drop O' clearest pearl Her hair was black her eyes were blue O what a lovely Girl Her neck was like the lilly white Her breast was like the swan She was in heart and loves delight A worship for a Man The corncraiks rispy song was oer The sun had left the light [alone] I love dusk kisses on the Moor To lewder life unknown Hid in the bosom of a flower Its lifetime there to dwell Eternity would seem an hour And I'd be resting well SWEET SOPHY'S EYES ARE CHRYSTALS CLEAR My bonny handsome gipsey girl I've loved thee long and ever shall Her beauty is of love the flame And Sophy Barret is her name Her bosom like a pillar swells And in her bright eye true love dwells Her Auburn hair her teeth O' pearl There's none can beat my gipsey girl My Sophys teeth are made O' pearl And she's my bonny gipsey girl Sweet leg and footed like [a] fawn She trips the common night and morn With sweet lips like the woodbine berry Scarlet and glossy as a cherry The emerald heaths and skys O pearl Surround my bonny gipsey girl Sweet Sophy's eyes are chrystals clear And soft dark hazle all the year Her bosom is as soft as silk Her neck and arms as white as milk Her hair is auburn and like dew Love looks the chrystal windows through O' none but nature ne'er can tell How I love my bonny gipsey girl THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE RUSHES The wind that shakes the rushes Upon the thistley crowded green The wind that stirs the bushes Where the thrushes nest has been That curdles o'er the water On the stone pits down the lane There live the ‘ale’ wifes daughter The bonny buxsome Jane She's sweeter than the wild rose On the white thorn fence in June Her voice more sweet and mild flows Then ballads sung in tune The bees upon the hive stones Sing by the window pane And sable bees the wild ones Sing pleasant songs to Jane The skylark nauntles through the grass And startles in the air And sings above the bonny lass His ballads sweet and fair The sooty blackbird sings so loud Till echo sings again And robin in the hovel proud Will sing to bonny Jane Her wind waved gown was bonny brown Wi' wheat blade strip's O green A sweeter girl i' all the town Than she was never seen The village bells O' sabbath days Sound sweetly down the lane They seem to sing in various ways go in and marry Jane OH SWEET IS THE SOUND O sweet is the sound O the doves clapping wings And the sound O' the wood gate thrown open that claps O sweet is the song o' the thrush where it sings And sweet the old oak where the woodpecker taps Where primrose and blue bell bloom littered around And the ever green Ivy feathered round the green tree Here spoke my sweet Susan there was love i' the sound O' her voice as she stood calmly talking to me Her hand held fine blue bells and primroses too Ribbed leaves of the hazels were beautifully green Anemonies too that were weeping in dew In the white hand O' Susan that morning were seen How sweet was her inky hair sweetened wi' dew How sweet was her bosom more white than the snow Her gown it was green speckled over wi blue O' her hair was jet black like the back of a crow Sweet looked the grey lichen upon the green oak The violets looked rich by each root mossy green And the raven croaked loud as a rustic had spoke Here Susan all day wi' her lover would lean Agen the white bark O' the oak to admire Green mosses and wild flowers spread round at her feet Her eyes were as bright as the suns liquid fire And the greenwoodlands still in her absence seems sweet ANGEL SHE SEEM'D AND WOMAN TOO She walks in beauty and in light And beauty dwells in every way An angel in the gloomy night A womans loveliness by day Calm blushing fa[i]ry form in bright A goodness that shall ne'er decay Need I describe her magic form The beauty of each budding breast To say how fair they are and warm Where love so much desires to rest In such a place in troubles storm How sweet would be the rest Angel she seemed and woman too So beautiful and fair Aereal forms that live in dew Sweet spirits of the air She was my boyhoods earlyest dreams And still my sweetest vision seems I knew her once in early days I love her memory now When wreaths of roses used to blaze Upon her sunny brow I loved her then unknown to ill She blooms the sweetest woman still THE FLOWER OF OUR VALLEY The flower of our valley Is the milkmaiden Sally I've neer seen her equal before She's as fine as wild roses And sweet as young posies And my heart she would gi' me no more One Sunday at noon She stole it all soon And turned my hind part all before The woods fields and bushes And pasture all rushes Seemed to stand somewhere else all the day There was nought seemed the same Wheresoever I came And I scarcely could find the old way My hand leapin[g] in to her breast neath her chin ‘Good-morning’ was all she would say Her voice like the linnet had melody in it Her eyes they were burning and bright Though the sun fit to burn ye Hadn't done his journey My dizziness took it for night Her breasts in her gown like two snow hills looked down And I sunk i' the drift out O' sight She's the flower of our Valley and her names pretty Sally Her eye is so bright it would burn ye My eyes were as straight As the best though I say't Till I went wi' fair Sally loves journey And if I get blind on't Herself shall be fined on't So I'll go and seek up an Atorney WEDDED JANE Is loves gold ring been broken The twin hearts golden token Dearest Jane, ‘Truth told beside the alter Was that e'er known to falter Come again’ I wooed thee and we wed Bride from the alter led The Bells rung when abed ‘Wedded Jane’ In summer both united In flowers and green fields plighted Dearest Jane Birds sung the truth o' nature And thou Mans sweetest creature Come again The cowslips gild the morn The chaffinch on the thorn Sings just as when at dawn I courted Jane But twenty years have braided Loves wreaths that bloomed and faded Absent Jane The chaffinch sings to morrow None heeds if joy or sorrow Dearest Jane Flowers came and none to heed I' hedge rows and the mead E'en the meanest weed Wanted Jane Cowslips have come again And daisy's sheet the plain Come again Loves golden ties near parted Though true love has been thwarted Dearest Jane I wooed thee and I wed thee And to the alter led thee Come to love where thy head lay Beautiful Jane Come here to my heart love And we'll never more part love My beautiful Jane The cowslips are growing The broad waters are flowing Pay debts to love owing My beautiful Jane ‘And then we'll have ease love’ ‘And live as we please love’ ‘In wedlock all freed’ SWEET ISABELLA COME Sweet Isabella fair and young The music of a womans tongue Does to those ruby lips belong Thy cheeks the roses bloom Eyes bright as pearl My own dear girl Sweet Isabella come Primroses pearled i' morning dew Wi' russet eye and brimstone blue Are waiting i' the woods for you And wild bees early hum That gently swell The anemonie Dear Isabella come Where the short billed linnet builds her nest And hides in moss her leaf green breast On mossy banks we well can rest Mid blue bells nodding bloom Wood butterfly Like flowers go by There Isabella come Blue violets they begin to shoot Beneath the mossy white thorn root And spread where milkmaid sets her foot Nor bruises scarce a flower Come Isabella My own sweet girl Enjoy the young spring hour The lark has left the trembling corn And whistles on the wings O morn The blue red east and ashy dawn And bees round thistles hum I love thee well My Isabella Muse o' ballad come THOSE EYES OF BLUE Sweet maiden with those eyes of blue And hair like tendons of the vine Sprinkled in pearl o' morning dew Sweet Phebe love be mine Like the rose i' the bud When in blossom thoult shine Like trees loud in the wood My song shall e'er be thine Sweet maiden with the bright blue eye Bind weeds ethereal blue The colour o' the spreading sky Is not more fair and true Like the sound i' the wood I am singing to thee Like the rose i' the bud I hope only true to be In loves happy moment so true I hope that you may yet be mine For long as the violet is blue My heart within still will be thine And true as the flower is To the spring in its hue My heart my dear Honoris Shall to Phebe live true WHEN I WAS YOUNG When I was young I fell in love and got but little good on't When she passed I turned away At first she would then woudn't I wished to speak and then the sigh Came first and always stopt it Come silence tell my wishes then I thought so and then dropt it And never tried to speak agen The path that o'er the cornfield lay I met her one day early She turned her face another way And I walked in the barley A lark that moment sought the sky Close to her gown or nearly Her bright eye looked to see him fly And then I loved her dearly And turns the rosey cheek to clay Tis beauty's face in woman's form That steals the senses all away That rends the bosom like a storm Though mild as evenings sober ray The winds they sigh the dews they weep And on the violets bosom fall First love and truth unriddles all NOW IS PAST Now is past the happy now When we together roved Beneath wild woods oak tree bough And nature said we loved Winters blast The now since then has crept between And left us both apart Winters that withered all the green Hath froze the beating heart Now is past Now is past since last we met Beneath the hazle bough Before the evening sun was set Her shadow stretched below Autumns blast Has stained and blighted every bough Wild strawberry's like her lips Have left the mosses green below Her blooms upon the hips Now is past Now is passed is changed agen The woods and fields has painted new Wild strawberry's which both gathered then None knows now where they grew The sky's o'er cast Wood stra[w]berry's faded from wood sides Green leaves have all turned yellow No Adelaide walks the wood sides True love has no bedfellow Now is past I'LL LOVE THEE NO MORE When spring comes unwelcome to the lovers eye[s] And the voice o' the singing bird grates on the ear When the green o' the white thorn idle fancies despise And beauty o' womanhood fails to be dear Then my thought shall be blighted and love pass away And bitterness nip my fond heart to its core And sweet sensibility drop and decay O' then dearest Ellen I'll love thee no more My beautiful Ellen...no I'll love thee no more When the wild flowers o' summer unnoticed forgotten Shall flourish neglected and blossom unseen When love in its coffin lies perished and rotten And none could believe what its beauty could mean Then the reign of fair woman is burried in chains And nought can the fame of her beauty restore All nature is withered the green of her plain[s] O' then dearest Ellen I'll love thee no more Dearest Ellen no—no— I can love thee no more Thy bosom the lilly those cheeks like the rose Thy lips like the bud or the bloom o' the brere When nature to charm us no pleasure bestows Then thy charms and thy person shall fail to be dear To every heart Ellen that beat but my own The rose that is withered no bloom can restore Thoul't be left as a flower in its beauty alone Then then dearest Ellen I can love thee no more—no, no Dearest Ellen I can love thee no more TIS PLEASANT TO WALK Tis pleasant to walk by the green wood side And stand by the spinney rails Where the misty rauk like smoke spreads wide And slow the puddock sails Tis pleasant to walk by the creeping brook Where the thistle and rest harrow bloom Where the black snail crawls by the sun forsook And creeps o'er the moss i' the gloom Tis then we will roam wi' the moon for our guide And Lucy's fond whispers walking close to my side Tis pleasant to walk with the maid at eve While the bat's on his leathern wing Fly's close to her bonnet not asking leave And in hedge rows the nightingales sing Tis heaven to kiss on her dew whet cheek And play with her coal black hair While on her pale face the moon beam weak Falls and makes shadows there The hazle by her side and the oak above Shades on her sweet face and twitters o' love Tis pleasant to see her form so bright And her bright glance turned on mine I' the green o' the leaves and the pale moon light And it[s] shadows so darkly divine Tis more than is pleasant to kiss her sweet face And see her eyes smiling on mine I' the green and the love o [the place] Where we stood in the pale moon shine By the old park side neath the old oak tree In her sunday gown my Lucy and me THERE IS A VOICE I LOVE TO HEAR There is a voice I love to hear A form I love to meet A face to me so very dear A smile so very sweet Her I love on from day to day Through seasons past and gone Of all the world when she's away She seems the only one There's no one else her place supplies That bosom white and those bright eyes There is a love to me so sweet Carnations are not half so dear There is a maid I love to meet The fairest blossom o' the year The rose is nothing like her lips No gem so bright as Biddy's eyes The mind is ever in eclipse That stays to listen loves replys There is a face I love to see Biddy's the sweetest maid to me She's handsomer than any flower More sweet than pinks or peas in bloom The love song o' the evening hour The moonbeam in the midnight gloom There is a voice when Biddy speaks Which I for ever love to hear I love to kiss her plump round cheeks And mean to love her all the year When Biddy's form and face I see She's all the world and more to me WHERE LOVE ARE YOU? How sweet does the hour seem When the sun's gone bed And gay clouds soft as dreams O'er the south west spread When the bee sleeps till morn Where thistles adorn The lane banks by the hedges All summered wi dew Dragon flies on the sedges But where love are you Our choice hour of meeting Youve let it go by Me the woodbine is greeting But lonely am I The bees on the thistle Where grass crickets whistle And lady birds creeping Regardless o' dew With nature they're keeping But where love are you You promised by sunshine Where the woodbine blooms sweetly You would come here and be mine When the dews on the flower In this lane you would love me Tis a beautiful hour And the moon shines above me You spoke not intending But where love are you I CLASP MY LOVELY GIRL Here we meet i' the moon light hour Here we stand by the sleeping flower Where dew drops hang as silent shower On each grass blade a pearl The moon tells endymions tale O'er the wild rose hedge i' the grassy vale While fondly I stand by the mossy rail And clasp my lovely girl In ivy tree sung the dove O'er the old pond gleams the calm o' love From the cloudless moon above Where I clasp my bonny girl Her heart pants like a new taen bird This white doe singled from the herd I kiss and not a thorn leaf's stirred Each beaded with a pearl I kiss her where no eye can see Where none are near but her and me By the awthorn hedge and Ivy tree I clasp my lovely girl In wild thyme hills by hedges green To kiss her cheeks where nought has been And teeth as white as pearl And love those eyes o' pearl The moon enlivens all the scene The old deep pond o' duckweed green The Ivy trees that o'er it lean In shadows from above All tell me o' the lovely girl With hazle eyes and teeth o' pearl I love so dear and ever shall The place remembers love BONNY JENNY O Where John goes bed at noon bonny Jenny O And the trees grow i' the hedge tall and many O There's a baulk and edding there green full of flowers and fair Come out and meet me there bonny Jenny O Where the cowslips make a smell bonny Jenny O By the spring heads sandy well bonny lassie O And penny royal too pinheaded o'er wi' dew At sunrise smelleth too bonny Jenny O Theres a primrose bank O' sweets bonny Jenny O And green moss for a seat bonny Jenny O There we'll cuddle side by side Where blue bells i' their pride Under heaven stovens grow bonny lassie O May I lean upon thy breast bonny lassie O And take a lovers rest bonny lassie O The dreams would be so sweet and thy beauty so complete Never more I'd wake to sigh bonny lassie O AUTUMN The thistle down's flying Though the winds are all still On the green grass now lying Now mounting the hill The spring from the fountain Now boils like a pot Through stones past the counting It bubbles red hot The ground parched and cracked is Like over baked bread The greensward all wrecked is Bents dried up and dead The fallow fields glitter Like water indeed And gossamers twitter Flung from weed unto weed Hill tops like hot iron Glitter hot i' the sun And the Rivers were eyeing Burn to gold as they run Burning hot is the ground Liquid gold is the air Who ever looks round Sees Eternity there YOUNG BESSY BRIGHT AND FAIR Bessey wi the inky hair Snow drops are not half so fair As her neck and bosom are O' Bessey wi the inky hair The splashes o' the gravel brooks That silvers o'er the sandy nooks Are not so sweet as thy loved looks Young Bessey bright and fair The crimson o' the morning cloud The saffron hue o' evening's shroud Are not so cheering or so proud As Besseys beaming eye And yet I think her face is seen In little flowers beneath the green That bloom the beds &amp; moss so green So innocen[t]ly shy Young Bessey is as sweet a thing As ever comes at early spring The linnet wi' its grassy wing Is not so fair a creature As Bessey wi' her inky hair Her swan white neck and bosom bare The lilly's self is not so fair As Love in every feature I see her in the morning sky I see her in the evening lye On hills o' heaven passing by Hills beautiful and fair I see her in the dewy flowers The slanting pearls o' summer showers Her happy smiles at evening hours And Bessys ink[y] hair MAID O' THE WILDERNESS Maid o' the wilderness Sweet i' thy rural dress Fond thy rich lips I press Under this tree Morning her health bestows Sprinkles dews on the rose That by the bramble grows Maid happy be Womanhood round thee glows Wander wi me The rest harrow blooming The sun just a coming Grass and bushes illuming And spreading oak tree Come hither sweet Susan Nor longer be choosing The morning is losing Its incense for thee The pea leaf has dews on Love wander wi me We'll walk by the river And love more than ever There's nought shall dissever My fondness for thee Soft ripples the water Flags rustle like laughter And fish follow after Leaves dropt from the tree Susan's beauty's fair Daughter Love wander wi me COME SOFTLY MY DARLING Come softly my darling My love quickly come To its hole fly's the starling The bee tutles home The moon it shines sweetly O'er firwood and lea O come out love and meet me My sweetheart to be My dear Mary Williams how lone absence seems Does nature ill will us The woods and the streams Come out love unchiding Our walk love shall be Down the lonely wood riding neath the rusty fir tree The night lamps of heaven The moons gentle light To thee and me love To walk out to night By thy gloved hand I'll charm thee and do nothing foul Where nought shall alarm thee Save the whoop o' the Owl All silent is moonlight Rustled leaps o' the frog Dark clouds passing soon light And bark o the dog Are all we shall hear love And nought shall we see But the white blooming brere love And the night black fir tree So come out Mary Williams and meet me to night Dark firs and grey willows Shall hide our delight My arm round thy blisses My lips on thy cheek I'd love thee in kisses Night and day the whole week MARY BATEMAN My love she wears a cotton plaid A bonnet o' the straw Her cheeks are leaves o' roses spread Her lips are like the awe In truth she is as sweet a maid As true love ever saw Her hair in ringlets black as ink And glossy is the lovely hue Her eyes look light as if they think Two heaps o' diamond dew For love I cannot sleep a wink For half the season through Her curls are ever in my eyes As nets by Cupid flung Her voice will oft my sleep surprise More sweet than ballad sung O' Mary Batemans curling hair I wake and there is nothing there I wake and fall asleep again The same delight in visions rise There's nothing can appear more plain Than these rose cheeks and those bright eyes I wake again and all alone Sits darkness on his ebon throne All silent runs the silver Trent The cobweb veils are all wet through A silver bead's on every bent On every leaf a bleb o' dew I sighed the moon it shone so clear Was Mary Bateman walking here THE DARK DAYS OF AUTUMN The dark days of Autumn grows cloudy and rainy The sun pales like sulphur the shadows grow long To me the dull season the sweetest of any I love to see yellow leaves fall in my song The rush covered green and thistle capped mountain The dead leaves a falling and winds singing round The willow and ash leaves they choak up the fountain There's health i' the strife o't and joy i' the sound I love there to loiter wi' winds blowing round me Till the strong eddies past and the rain gust is over Wild pigeons fly over the instance looks downy With [stunt] willow rows [and] pieces of clover Brown pieces o' stubbles ground o' turnips bright green The crows flying over the lakes silver light Scarce a wild blossom left to enliven the scene Rauk and mist are for ever in sight PEGGY'S THE LADY O' THE HALL And will she leave the lowly clowns For silks and satins gay Her woolen Aprons and drab gowns For lady's cold array And will she leave the wild hedge rose The redbreast and the wren And will she leave her sunday beaus And milk shed i' the glen And will she leave her kind friends all To be the Lady o' the Hall The cowslips bowed their golden drops The white thorn white as sheets The lamb agen the old ewe stops The wren and robin tweats And Peggy took her milk pails still And sang her evening song To milk her cows on cowslip hill For half the summer long But silks and satins rich and rare Are doomed for Peggy still to wear But when the May had turned to awes The hedge rows swelled to hips Peggy was missed without a cause And left us in eclipse The shepherd i' the hovel milks Where builds the little wren And Peggy's gone a' clad i' silks Far from the happy glen From dogrose woodbine clovers all Peggy's the Lady of the hall WINTER How blasted nature is, the scene is winter The Autumn withered every branch Leaves drop, and turn to colourless soil Ice shoots i' splinters at the river Bridge And by and bye all stop— White shines the snow upon the far hill top Nature's all withered to the root, her printer To decay that neer comes back Winds burst, then drop Flowers, leaves and colours, nothing's left to hint her Spring, Summer, Autumn's, withered into winter THE SCOTCH AND IRISH GIRL I loved a Scotch then Irish girl But now I'm lone and free A diamond one the next a pearl Both buried i' the Sea I sung for one I sighed for two And tryed the last to win The first she let the tie knot go Wi none I claimed akin The Scotch girl had a bonny face And coal black was her hair The Irish girl was first i' place Her bosom was so fair 'Twas whiter than the new fallen snow Her eye was like the sun That failed that frozen spot to show Between them Im undone The Scotch girl turned her nose awry “Yere no my ain laddie At bonny Jean my mind did try But she'd not hearken me The Irish maiden said ‘Och hounds My eye is not that same My Pat the Irish near confounds Get back the gate ye came I LOVE THE BLUE VIOLET I love the blue violet that creeps on the mossy bank And wood bell so purple wi green leaves so glossy rank Where wild rabbits caper wi' many a tossy prank And show their white shirts to the light I love the mossy bank by the green hazle bush I love the early song o' the brown missle thrush And dairy decked mole hill i' beds o the tassle rush I' the middle o' summers delight But better than mossy banks twenty times over Or wind waving rush beds the form of my lover Sweet Susan as fair as the clumps o' white clover Ever feeding the songs o' the bee O' harmless as white legged lambs round the mole hills Wi' her beauty and truth to o'er flowing the soul fills On Susans white bosom a beauty spot mole hills And makes her more dear to me Her hair is as dark as the cloud i' the bright morn Her bosom's as white as the flower o the white thorn Her lips are as red as the rose bud i' light born And dear is young Susan to me I wooed her and won her and doatingly love her And think her the lovliest all the world over And sweeter than rose buds than red or white clover Is bonny young Susan to me OH THERE IS A VALLEY O there is a valley where I met pretty Sally Sure never seemed woman or valley so fair How sweet womans clouths is her cheeks like red roses Blushed warmly and sweet through her bonny dark hair Round woodbines winds Sally and the cheeks o' young Sally Wove a colour more sweet than the bloom o' the brere Her hair it was dark brown her eye fetched the lark down While mounted in heaven a singing most clear King cups wi' pearls all inside by the morning Were studded all over the green grassy leas Oaks glossy green brightness sheeted daisy beds whit[e]ness And sweeter that morning the song of the bees When I clasped my arms round her and doatingly found her The sweetest o' maidens I'd e'er before seen Where the gay and bright butterfly's with their wings full o eyes Seemed like flowing flowers sprung from the grass green O this is the valley where I met pretty Sally Among the hedge roses and trailing woodbine Where the yellow sweet briar like a green bush on fire On our dazzeled fancies did shine Where the blue bells in dew drooping all the wood through THE NIGHT IS STILL The night is still dead Oak leaves strew Dyke bottoms and the green grass too When I came here the golden west Wore all the daylights golden crown The sun lay on its mottled breast Within an hours going down When Mary at my elbow stood Beside the green entangled wood I loved her there among green hues The green white thorn i' evening dews And loud the snort o' feeding horse Grazeing beside that woody lane Green bushes where we stood beneath On green grass and beds o moss While sweet came evenings dewey breath Where I and Mary again met We meet and love firm as a rock The birds our voices seem to mock Hedge sparrows with their eggs o blue Sat on their green moss nest Where Mary's smiles looked more than true And calm her snowy breast And by the Ivied Oak tree wood Mary and I one evening stood THE MILKMAID IS BONNY AND FAIR O the milkmaid a beautiful flower And kind as a prayer book to me She shows me more truth in an hour Than the Parson and prayer book in three She shews me sweet tales o wild flowers And the chaffinches nest i' the thorn She'll be talking to birds for whole hours And the sweetest girl ever was born Her face is all roses her neck's like her milk And white as the daisy's snow rim Her bosoms as soft as the silk She'd beauty in every limb The hedge roses hung on the brere Had nothing at all to admire Than her smile there was nothing so dear Then her eyes they were brighter than fire The Milkmaid is bonny and fair Though only seen morning and e'en All glossy and dark is her hair Her gown it was bonny and green Where the green linnet ruffles her wing And shakes the pearl drops from thorn boughs O the Milkmaid's a beautiful thing When she sits there a milking her cows THE MAIDEN CLAD WI' CLAY Her cot has got the shutters closed Her garden's full o weeds The beds where larkheel flowers reposed The stinging nettle breeds Stray tulips may be coming still But thistles hide the flowers Once their lived flowers that meant no ill And loved the summers dewy showers Her Mother lost her Father first And then she lost her cow Poultry and pigs like childern mist And none knew where or how She put the pot lid on agen Ere tears fell i' the pot She seldom wept afore the Men Nor yet condemned her lot At last her Mother pined away And every friend she had A branch broke from a bush o may Could hardly seem as bad Jenny neer doubted her belief Nor deemed Gods judgement wrong But went away oer come wi grief And may be not for long Nine years have come nine years have past And Jenney not returned The doors and shutters nail'd up fast Till even sparrows mourned The flowers in blossom used to stoop Not tied up as before No hand was left to tie them up Weeds spread up to the door And every year brought thicker crops Choked flowers were seen no more And then they nailed the shutters up And then they nailed the door Though tears were shed and blessings said When the Maiden went away But tears long dry and so's each sigh The Maidens clad in Clay THE PEARTREE LANE There's places in our village streets Where I dearly loved to be The round cross full o' stoney seats At the Stable and the tree The brown bleached Oaks they sit upon Where the old Roll still remain And still I love to walk alone Down the Peartree Lane The Elm trees o'er our Garden wall How beautiful they grew Where ring Doves from their nest would call And the vein leaved Ivy grew At the old house end while one hugh Elm That turned a whole days rain Storm roared as 'twould the town o'erwhelm Twas shelter down the lane The blacksmiths shed the Coblers shop Chock holes and marble rings By the Cross steps the spinning top Are memorable things The schoolboys love at morn and eve' When spring comes in again But nought can beat the primrose leaves Down Peartrees dirty lane There the Bumbarrel build[s] her nest On early green white thorn The Chaffinch shews her ruddy breast O'er her Lichen nest at morn The Mavis there at Christmas time Begins his early strain And dead Oak leaves though glazed i' rime Look dear in Peartree Lane The woodland stile the broken gap And day lights peeping moon Where red cloaked goody fills her lap To boil the kettle soon Anemonies peep through the hedge Hedgesparrows find a strain Theres nothing i' the world I pledge Like dear old Peartree Lane THE SWEETEST WOMAN THERE From bank to bank the water roars Like thunder in a storm A Sea in sight of both the shores Creating no alarm The water birds above the flood fly o'er the foam and spray And nature wears a gloomy hood On this October day And there I saw a bonny maid That proved my hearts delight All day she was a Goddess made An angel fair at night We loved and in each others power Felt nothing to condemn I was the leaf and she the flower And both grew on one stem I loved her lip her cheek her eye She cheered my midnight gloom A bonny rose neath Gods own sky In one perrenial bloom She lives mid pastures evergreen And meadows ever fair Each winter spring and summer scene The sweetest woman there She lives among the meadow floods That foams and roars away While fading hedge rows distant woods Fade off to naked spray She lives to cherish and delight All nature with her face She brought me joy morn noon and night In that low lonely place I LOVE HER JUST THE SAME AS EVER I love her just the same as ever Though now she looks above me Had she done wrong I could forgive her And would for ever love her And do I kiss thy cheek again The rose o the creation Those lips that rubies vie in vain As sweet as a carnation I wish I was some little flower Some flower she likes the best She'd pluck me in the sunny hour And pin me to her breast She'd pin me to her breast for love And I that love should be O could I such a favour prove Choice were such love to me A black cloak o'er her shoulders thrown Made of the finest silk The neck and bosom sweetly shone As white as is new milk I wish I was a little bird To please her with my song I'd whistle tunes she's often heard And love all summer long THE PRIMROSE PEEPS The primrose peeps Where green moss weeps All under the Maple tree When April weaves The woods green leaves Dear is the place to me When Maria and me Seek the mossy green tree Scaring bees from the flowers as we go Primrose and blue bell And violet as well That all o'er the Ivy ground grow Maria was sweet As the flowers neath her feet The dead leaves were pleasantly stirred As they fled from the shoe Mid the blossoms and dew Like the rustle and flight of a bird The primrose peeps And the green moss creeps All under the Maple tree Where Maria so warm Is hung on my arm And walking the woods wi' me OH BONNY ANN WAS FAIR TO SEE The pilewort through the meadow blazes The daisy blooms again The green grass like a furnace blazes And clumps of snow remain The foot paths that before me lay Showed darker green and brown The sunny cots and steeples grey Looked pleasant up and down The very cots a foliage yields Birds did the seasons sing The villages were like the fields All wore the hues of spring They did so when with heart consent Not meaning to trepan I printed fields and brushed the bent A courting bonny Ann O bonny Ann was fair to see And where grey willows wave I met wi her and her wi me Where river waters lave Where nature dwells wi nought to teaze And nothing to trepan Among the grass and willow trees I met wi' bonny Ann OH THE DAY IT WAS BLACK O the day it was black when my love and I waited And mournfully bellowed the wind I kissed her in tears as she sobbed broken hearted That I left her dear Cabin behind But trod only o' reptiles that all the year bait me As nought but a thorn on the brere And pestered by friendships that silently hate me I ventured my fortune to steer I left my clay biggin twas close to the wild wood Where the childern sought wild flowers and played the whole year Where the robin and wren seemed as pleased as a child would To hear Childers voices the bushes so near I left all my childer at play neath the white thorn The youngest for Acorn cups turned up her eyes I turned back to reach one all wearied and blight worn And kissed them all round and then bid her good by The bright morning shot gold threads through green bushes And spread in dark places bright patches o' gold I left all the Songs o the black birds and thrushes The goats o' the mountain the sheep by the fold I went while the Ocean lay rolling before me On the white foaming waves i' the Fleet to sojourn And hope with her Anchor seemed lolling just o'er me To bid me good luck and a speedy return JUST NOW I MET A MAIDEN Just now I met a maiden With a bright and diamond eye Trees wi' yellow leaves were laden And cloudy was the sky Where the cart horse daily trudges And the cart goes rocking by There I met a pretty maiden Wi a bright and diamond eye The birds had sung no matins No lark was in the sky When with an umberrella She passed me on the way And I never saw her fellow For beauty till that day On her cheeks ten thousand kisses lye But none to take away Her mouth was luscious loveliness Half open with a smile And Lady like her bonny dress The Queen o' cherry Isle O bright and bonny was the maid Though gloomy was the day To love her I was half afraid Tho' brightly shone her eye I feel it now a flood of joy Steals o'er in memory's power I felt it when I was a boy Round this delightful flower And now I live her dwelling near The floods may rave and roar I think I love her all the year And shall for ever more THE EVENING WAS LOVELY The evening was lovely and littered wi dew The points o' the thistle was knibbed wi a pearl When I went i' the gloaming where bindweed bells grew And talked to young Dinah a beautiful girl O' bright were the ringlets adown her cheek glowing And bright were her eyes as the dibbles o dew That knobs all the spears o' the thistle flowers blowing While hesperus shone like a lamp i' the blue O' down i' the e'ening O' moon lighted gloaming Among the big thistles so blooming and sweet I the wild flowers and rush beds were both o' us roaming While the stars shone above us like the Lamps i' the street I' the hollow old Ash tree the Owl hooted loud And whewed down the hedge like a spirit i' white The Moon for a moment popt under a cloud And I kissed her soft cheek like a joy out o sight The restharrow trailed like small flowers o' the pea And the dandy brow daisy like buttoned to green On the thistle flower stone dead asleep was the bee That cocked up his legs when our finger was near The moon lay like candle light on the thorn leaves The dew glittered pearls on the bents where they hing And O' her white bosom delightfully heaves While i' the wood riding the Night[in]gale[s] sing AMELIA THOU MAID O' MY BOSOM Amelia thou maid of my bosom come hither The hedges are green and the day fit for wooing Come e're the trees and the bushes all wither By the old ivied Ash where the ring dove is cooing For clear is the landscape and sweet is the weather Wi' the leaves and the blossoms all covered wi' dew Amelia there we will wander together And crop the proud flowers i' fields we go through Where the primrose it blooms by the mossy green thorn And the Violet smells on the green mossy bank And the writing lark lays by the path i the corn And the hedge sparrows eggs where the bramble grows rank As blue as the blue bell below the moss nest Then come my Amelia as soon as sunrise Gather primrose or violet as suiteth thee best And take home the wild flowers as bright as thy eyes Put on thy straw hat sweet Amelia and come And throw on thy shawl yellow spotted and brown We'll follow the Bee in its musical hum And leave all beside i' the Cottage and Town The butterfly waiting to court your new gown The path for your footsteps shuns most of the dew The old Ivied ash tree leans as if to fall down And the birds morning music is waiting for you IT IS LOVE! It is love Theres a mildness i' the air The fields are green and fair And sunbeams there From above There is singing o birds There is bleating o' herds Waters waving like curds What is love But the landscapes o' spring sunny green o' the grove And the maid walking there Mary Dove Is it love To admire what God's sending Charm on charm never ending Ever varying unspending Look above Clouds rocks rough and ragged Temples unhewed and jagged Where currish man never begged What is love But nature and truth over ocean and grove And that first boyish charm Mary Dove It is love While grass remains green Mary Dove And clouds sail in heaven above And flowers come wi' spring you'll be love Mary Dove Burnet buttons growed dark in that hour Purpled Fetch dangled on the thorn bower And each little weed had a flower but love In that little meadow like joys from above Walks the poets young fancy the sweet Mary Dove ADIEU TO GREEN MEADOWS Adieu to the green meadows To the wild flowers blooming fair Since Mary Morris left me I cant be happy there Both stood to see the sun go down And river onward flow But Mary's gone and left the Town And I know not where to go I loved one Mary Morris At the bottom o' the glen Then wild flower o' the forest She's half as sweet agen Her hue upon the brere grew There's freckles near her chin Her lips out shine the dear rose That smells so sweet within Dull looks the meadows grasses Since Mary went away Fairest o' country lasses And I wish her here to day Now the beanfields are in blossom And the meadow sweet looks gay I would lean upon her bosom And kiss all my cares away MY SWEET BONNY ANN Dear Anna the sweetest The world ever saw Is thy face and completest Thy bosom and a' Than lillies more white More red than the rose Her eyes beaming brighter Than the fountain that flows My sweet bonny Ann and Anna my dear I will come if I can By the spring o' the year I will come if I can At the end of the week And love like a Man On thy beautiful cheek My sweet bonny Ann And my dear bonny Ann There's nothing worth living for Without bonny Ann Full bosomed and bonny And ripe for a Man And fairer than ony Is young bonny Ann Her bosom shames lillies Her face rivals roses Then daffadown dillys And other sweet posies Words ever so striking On true loves own plan Can't form a true likeness O' young bonny Ann HELLEN BONNY HELLEN O Hellen bonny Hellen why so coy The spring is with us but thou art not here It was but tother day I passed thy dwelling And could not see thy dwelling anywhere In every thicket where they've trees been felling Where leafs the white thorn and where shoots the brere Here swarm the brimstone primrose in moss dwelling But silence answers Hellen is not here The spring it is come and the primroses pale Blaze through as they'd burn ye before ye get near The hedgesparrows whistle i' the thorn i' the dale But where art thou hiding sweet Hellen my dear Hedgesparrows they whistle the hedges get green And violets and primroses blossom again I' thy soft flowing dresses my Hellen be seen And we'll meet in old courtship on Meadow and plain REMEMBER THEE LOVE?

happiest smile Till the sunbeams o' day leave the Night to our Isle Till the end o' the world thou my darling shall prove And the finish o' times the begining o' Love 'TWAS ON AN APRIL MORNING Twas on an April morning When the Cowslips were in blooming And daisies banks adorning And sunny beams illuming I down the meadow rambled And by the river strayed Among white thorn and bush Where I met a lovely maid Right early i' the morning Before the break o' day When the crimson east was dawning And the morning sky blue grey I met a lovely Maiden And singing on her way With well scoured Milk pails laden Just by the break o' day The dew drops in the cowslips Shone like some silver pearl The bullrush like a bow dips Reeds rustle near the girl Who fills her pail wi' new milk By the sandy spotted Cow While she thinks a gown of blue silk Would well become her now Larks whistle round like lovers Then drop into the grass And pairs o' screaming Plovers Swop round the lovely lass, Purple dew the eve is bringing The sun is sinking low While the Maiden milketh singing Her sandy spotted Cow THE SHARP WIND SHIVERS The sharp wind shivers in the warm gorse blossoms And trembles in the dead grass o'er the heath The silver rain pearls in the wild flowers bosoms And moistens minute flowers of moss beneath There i' the morning dew I early ramble What time beneath the fern the weary moth Hides from the sun in dew drops hangs the bramble As down the rabbit track I venture forth I wander like a sunbeam i' the green Immortal harmony of natures love Her music charms me as a thing unseen And hopes emblazoned sunshine gleams above Blooming Maria is the Maid I love The rosey young and beautiful Maria She sometimes meets me in the tangled grove And by her beauty sets my soul on fire The black cock hides his dwelling i' the gorse Wi' curly tail red eyes and shining breast Among the bracken feeds the weary horse On the short sward then lays him down to rest O rosey cheeked and beautiful Maria The evening is not chill the heaven grey Drops dew and beauty from all crowds retire Then why from loves embraces keep away ONE SUMMER SUNDAY MORNING One summer Sunday morning The bells for Church did chime Hedges the May adorning Just like some foreign clime Where Emma was a walking By brooks that run so clear And whispering reeds were talking Love stories in her ear She loved the fields and closes And her eyes upon them cast She loved the wild hedge roses And she pluckt one as she passed She loved the whispering sedges Like her lovers voice to hear And the May upon the hedges With the blackbirds singing clear She loved them all so dearly Where I told a lovers tale By the waters running clearly And the May bush i' the vale The sky was full o' pale clouds And of wild flowers the hay The willows waved like grey shrouds That happy Sabbath day I loved her in beholding And kissed her cheek so sweet And in my arms enfolding I felt her bosom beat She seemed in no delemma And never heaved a sigh Twas thus I courted Emma And I'll love her till I die HOW BEAUTIFUL THE SUN WENT DOWN How beautiful the sun went down And lovely shone the Moon When I and Hannah left the town To wander forth alone Her bonny face and shoulders broad Her feet made music too When step by step along the road We wandered i' the dew The white Owl like a stupid oaf Banged right against the tree When I went out with Hannah Rolph The dew fields to see The hedge rose hung wi' silver pearls That shone like polished glass And round the Moon the light cloud curls And there they quickly pass The little bird flew from its nest And feared the trampling foot Where Hannah's footsteps lightly prest On shadows black as soot Her gown it caught the arching brere That shook off drops o' dew And blue cornbottles growing near Were black in moonlights hue O' Hannah Rolphs a lovely girl Wi lily neck and shoulders broad With rosey cheeks and teeth o' pearl Theres no such blossoms ever bloomed Beneath the round Moons mellow light My arm around her neck I threw And kissed her cheek her eye shone bright While courting Hannah i the dew THE CROW SAT ON THE WILLOW The crow sat on the willow tree A lifting up his wings And glossy was his coat to see And loud the ploughman sings I love my love because I know The milkmaid she loves me And hoarsely croaked the glossy crow Upon the willow Tree I love my love the ploughman sung And all the field wi' music rung I love my love a bonny lass She keeps her pails so bright And blythe she t[r]ips the dewy grass At morning and at night A cotton drab her morning gown Her face was rosey health She traced the pastures up and down And nature was her wealth He sung and turned each furrow down His sweethearts love in cotton gown My love is young and handsome As any in the Town She's worth a ploughmans ransom In the drab cotton gown He sung and turned his furrows o'er And urged his Team along While on the willow as before The old crow croaked his song The ploughman sung his rustic Lay And sung of Phebe all the day The crow was in love no doubt And wi a many things The ploughman finished many a bout And lustily he sings My love she is a milking maid Wi' red and rosey cheek O' cotton drab her gown was made I loved her many a week His milking maid the ploughman sung Till all the fields around him rung OH COMELY IS THE ROSY BRERE O' comely is the rosey brere That blooms among the thorns And bonny are the dew drops bright earlily at morn And bonny is the primrose bush tender the white thorn green And bonny is the woodbine tree i' the dewy hour o e'en That blossoms i' the moonlight close by the thrushes nest And I will pluck a choice one for Peggys bonny breast Peggy Stapleton is sweeter than woodbines e'er can be And sweeter at the evening hour is Peggys walk wi me When oer the level meadow the sinking sun has set And round the Village cross the ploughmen they are met When the sparrows gone to bed and the Crow is on her nest And the Baby it is sleeping upon the Mothers breast When the hens are gone to roost And the Cows are at their lair Neath the homesteads spreading ash trees and pleasant places there I wander out alone when the stars look in the tree And bonny Peggy Stapleton goes walking wi' me I meet my Peggy there while the Lark flew from the grass Wi' my arm about her Aprons strings I kissed the bonny lass I kissed her on the chin and I kissed her on the cheek And we walked about the meadow till the moon was fit to speak Young Peggys neck was white as the water running clear But her cheek it burnt the colour o' the rose upon the brere And beautiful at dewy Eve the spreading dark oak tree While the moon is looking through and Peggy courting me IN THE FIELD— In the field where the Nettle burdock and Sowthistles Ramp up by the hovel where builds the small wren When summer winds rustle and winter storms whistle I gang over a Week to meet Katey agen I'm all over eager on fine Sunday mornings To seek the old shed on the path beaten track And I lose both my shoe strings the weeds and the corn in Every day seems a twelve month e'er Sunday comes back I love at my labour each bunch o' keen nettles That grow where I work as the finest o' flowers I love Kate begrimed with her black pots and kettles And kiss her sweet face i' the shed at all hours The milky sowthistles their pale tops I kiss The burdocks broad leaves are my summers delight For the good natured prickle burs Katey cant miss They stick to her stockings both morning and night Before me she takes up her gown in my sight To pull the inquisitive creepers away Her calf is so large and her stockings so white I do nought but worship the rest o the day O' sweet bonny Katey what maiden's so fair The sun stoops to westward the clouds come wi' night These wind shaken cowslips I'll leave and repair To the shed and court Katey my joy and delight OH COME TO MY ARMS O' come to my arms i' the cool o' the day When the veil o' the evening falls dewy and grey O' come to me under the awthorn green When eventide falls i' the bushes serene O come to me under the awthorn tree When the lark's on his nest and gone bed is the bee When the veil of the evening falls dark on the scene And we'll kiss love and court i' the bushes so green O come to me dear wi' thy own Maiden head Where the wild flowers and rushes shall make thee a bed We will lye down together in each others arms Where the white Moth flirts by not give us alarms Where the rush bushes bend and are silvered wi' dew Ere the sunbeam the red cloud O' morning breaks through Thy face is so sweet and thy neck is so fair O' come at eve dearest and live with me there IN GREEN GRASSY PLACES In the white thorn hedges the blackbird sings Where the hedgesparrow flutters his dirty brown wings And the skylark he trembles above the green wheat While the thrush in the spinny is singing so sweet So come lovely Susan we'll walk i' the fields And meet all the pleasures the lovely spring yields For of all the gay lasses sweet Susan I see There's none that I fancy my sweetheart but thee So come my dear Susan and where the thrush sings The primrose and violets the earliest springs The Chaffinch is building his nest on the brere And the bottle tit hangs up his pudding bag near I' the ribs o the hedge the hedgesparrow builds And the brown o' his feathers the morning sun gilds I long my dear Susan to walk out wi thee In green grassy places thy sweetheart to be We'll walk where the barley is hiding the clod We'll walk where the daisy blooms stars on the sod Where the Herrinshaw builds in the flags by the streams There Susan we'll loiter in green summer dreams By the side o' the river running like glass We'll seek early cowslips that quake i' the grass And there bonny Susan I'll love you so true And kiss you and court you and ne'er bid adieu IT WAS A PLEASANT EVENING It was a pleasant Evening the bee had gone to rest I' the bosom of the dogrose the sun sunk in the West And left in Western heaven its own refulgent dye Pink as Dianas Nipples blue as Urana's eye And white as Phebe's bosom are the snow banks o' the West All littered wi' blue violets i' the Mansions o the West Where womans thoughts reposes in her childhood with her Child And never was the Evening so beautiful and mild The broom flower was as yellow as a new found rock o' Gold And the evening gloamed as mellow as my eyes did e'er behold The Mountains a' looked golden up to their very tops And some went in the blue so far as if they wanted props The dew more clear than silver 'gan to glitter on a' things To heather flowers and broom like beads o' pearl in strings It was a lovely evening ever speckled with the dew The Earth was of a' colours the sky was gold and blue And lovely was the Maiden encircled in my arms Her heart was beating rarely i' the warmth o' loves alarms Her face was like the heather and Inky black her hair And whiter than the lily was her bonny bosom bare I held [her] in my arms and I kissed her in the broom And beautiful carnations red upon her cheeks did come I kissed her i' the green broom i' extacys delight Then went home to her Cottage and kissed [her] a' the night COY MAIDENS O' DRYSAIL Coy Maidens o' Drysail bonny Girls o' Buckhiven Young beauty's o' Largo bonny Lasses o' Leven I loved them the gether I loved one alone And the rest followed with her Else I'd made her my own Nay stop there auld Sodger Yo're nae kin o' her kind She belongs to young Rodger our Shepherd—sae mind Her voice shouted Rodger like throwing a stone Sae gae on oud Sodger and let her alane The voice it gaed through me like throwing a stone And sair did it rue me knocking at my breast bone Gae awa' wi' yer Rodger young Man do I see If you'r then auld Sodger you may march on wi' me Sae I went with the Maiden over heath and o'er plain And when Sunday was come too I saw her again I saw her and courted the sun from the West And left my last kiss on the mole of her breast I kissed and were married and bed[d]ed and a' And the auld Kirk at Upton the green Wedding saw For the grass it was green and our years was the same And frae morning to E'en Nane ca'd us to blame THE SPRING COMES AGAIN LOVE When spring comes again love Bringing green to the tree And May down the lane love Smells sweetly o' thee Wilt thou remember then Of us both standing here now And come to the road glen And look at the brere bough And think what we've spoken And love the oath taken Let this be the token And love's not forsaken Here the hedge brere reposes Where manhood in glee Cropt the finest hedge roses Dew sprinkled for thee Years have faded since then As many will do Ere I stand here agen To be talking with you Every leaf i' this place Wears a love all its own Since I've gazed on thy face To the vulgar unknown The sattin flowered mallow Was blossoming nigh Where I kissed while the swallow Came swimming fast by The white thorn and hedge brere And the bramble flower too Smile when I pass here And remind me of you THE PEASANT POET He loved the brook's soft sound The swallow swimming by He loved the daisy covered ground The cloud bedappled sky To him the dismal storm appeared The very voice of God And where the Evening rock was reared Stood Moses with his rod And every thing his eyes surveyed The insects I' the brake Where Creatures God almighty made He loved them for his sake A silent man in lifes affairs A thinker from a Boy A Peasant in his daily cares— The Poet in his joy AND MUST WE PART? And must we part that once so close And fond where knit together Loves buds betorn by wonton force The flowers for summer weather And must my happy thoughts decay And summer blossoms wither The hope that cheered me many a day Must now belong to neither Yet still the Cottage chimney smokes Beneath the spreading walnut Though heeded not by other folks There evil can no gall put Green grass there looks never cold 'Sward daisies none looks whiter The willow leaves fall off like gold In autumn and look brighter To Bessey I'll not say farewell Nor trouble feel at parting I'll love the Cottage where ye dwell And feel one truth as certain For natures self will dwell wi' me To charm all sorts o' weather And love and truth will still agree And leave us both together THEN SHALL WE MEET AGAIN How many times spring blossoms meek Hath faded on the land Since last I kissed that pretty cheek And pressed that happy hand Eight times the greens been painted white With daisy's i' the grass Since I looked on thy eyes so bright And pressed my bonny lass The ground lark sung about the Farms The blackbird i' the Wood When fast locked in each others arms By hedge row thorn we stood It was a pleasant Sabbath day The sun shone bright and round That through the dark Oakes threaded lay Like gold upon the ground How beautiful the black bird sung And answered by the thrush And sweet the pearl like dew drops hung Upon the white thorn bush O happy day—eight years ago We parted without pain The blackbird sings primroses blow When shall we meet again WE PASSED BY GREEN CLOSES The path crossed green closes and went down the lane Where the black snail reposes and the slime marks remain The hook prickle bramble Arch's over the grass And tears in her ramble The gown o' the Lass The Wind in her

The homesteads that each Cottage shields He loved and made them Classic ground The lonely house the rural walk He sang so musically true E'en now they share the peoples talk Who love the poet Cowper too Who has not read the ‘Winter storm’ And does not feel the fallen snow And Woodmen keeping noses warm With pipes where ever Forests grow In France in Germany and Spain The same delightful pictures show The Cowpers ‘Woodmens’ seen again And Lurchers tracking thro the snow The ‘Winters walk’ and ‘Summers Noon’ We meet together by the fire And think the ‘walks’ are o'er too soon When books are

fanned the sunny air The ivy clasped the Tree I placed myself behind the path And dropt a word or two She kind replied to all I said And shunned the grassy dew I clasped my arm about her neck And

talking Is something so dear To the joys o' the season I think it divine And wish with good reason Such companion was mine The old Cow is followed By the maidens glad eye Butterflyes sulphur coloured She sees gadding bye And the small Tortoise shell When the primroses bloom By the woodside will tell When the warmer days come SONG [The wind waves oer the meadows green] The wind waves oer the meadows green And shakes my own wild flowers And shifts about the moving scene Like the life o' summer hours The little bents with reedy head The scarce seen shapes o' flowers All kink about like skeins o' thread In these wind shaking hours All stir &amp; strife &amp; life &amp; bustle Is every thing around we see The rushes whistle sedges rustle The grass is buzzing round like Bees The butterflyes are tossed about Like skiffs upon a stormy sea The bees are lost amid the rout And drop in green perplexity Wilt thou be mine thou bonny lass Thy drapery floats so gracefully We'll walk along the meadow grass We'll stand beneath the willow tree We'll mark the little reeling bee Along the grassy ocean rove Tossed like a little boat at sea And interchange our vows of love SONG [Long

solitude Where the flower in green darkness, buds, blossoms &amp; fades Unseen of a shepherds &amp; flower loving maids The hermit bees find them but once &amp; away There I'll burry alive &amp; in silence decay I looked on the eyes o' fair woman too long Till silence and shame stole the use o' my tongue When I tried to speak to her I?. nothing to say So I turned myself round &amp; she wandered

brawls While peace upon the velvet sward sits bye And heaven seems melting from so soft a sky SONG [Tell the wish of thy heart in flowers sweet maid] Tell the wish of thy heart in flowers sweet maid Words never speak so plain As a dogrose cropt from the woods green bowers Or a cowslip cropt i the rain To stoop for't &amp; cherish it home i thy breast While the rain drops fall i the face And like pearls o' joy on thy happy cheeks rest From the bushes &amp; green grassy place [How beautiful the hazy morning seems!] The dew drops on every blade of grass The dew drops on every blade of grass are so much like silver drops that I am obliged to stoop down as I walk to see if they are pearls, and those sprinkled on the Ivy woven beds of Primroses underneath the hazels, white thorns and Maples are so like gold beads that I stooped down to feel if they were hard but they melted from my finger—And where the dew lies on the Primroses the violets and white thorn leaves they are emerald and berryl yet nothing more than the dews of the morning on the budding leaves nay the road grasses are cover'd with gold and silver beads and the further we go the brighter they seem to shine like solid gold and silver—It is nothing more than the suns light and shade upon them in the dewy morning—every thorn point and every bramble spear has its trembling ornament till the wind gets a little brisker and then all is shaken off and all the shining jewelry passes away into a common spring morning full of budding leaves Primroses Violets Vernal Speedwell Blue Bell and Orchis—and common place objects— FRAGMENTARY How beautiful the hazy morning seems! And calm, and tranquil: though the mist still glooms O'er the horizon; shutting out sun beams. Through dew and mist the bright sun comes, And redolent with spring the primrose blooms. One almost feels spring growing in the grass; The hedge rows round you, with its sweet perfumes Gives to the winnowing breezes as they pass— A thrill of joy which lifes dark sphere illumes— Bright — [‘Such is the Almighty Will’ so spake the honest brow] ‘Such is the Almighty Will’ so spake the honest brow, But the cold grave covers his body now, And the rank grass, and weeds that hide his breast Are dull and green, and common as the rest. Hush ‘rest in peace’ — [The sedges sighing by the meadows stream] The sedges sighing by the meadows stream, While over head grey willows nod and dream As though 'twas night — [I wish the king cups they would come again] I wish the king cups they would come again, Gold in green grass, beaded with pearls o' rain, Blue eyes that seem to beckon as they gaze To kiss those sweet lips — SONG. ‘BONNY MARY’— 1 Dearest Mary! ever dearest! How lovely is the morning! All is bright when thou appearest, Come and we'll hail days dawning, Where the oak tree, darkly shadows, O'er the dew'y dasied grass, Where the song of thrushes glad us, There I'll court my bonny lass— 2 Let me clasp thee, bonny Mary, Underneath the dark oak bough, Where the breeze comes light, and airy, And quiet feeds the sheep, and cow, Bonny Mary! let me clasp thee, Where the ivied oak tree leans, Oer the brambles, there I'll grasp thee, And teach thee what true courtship means— 3 Bonny Mary! maid the rarest! Plump and rosy—sweetest—dearest— I'll clasp, and kiss thee as the fairest Ever seen—With love sincerest I'll caress thee, hear my pleading! Thou art all the world to me: All thy virtue's I've been heeding; May gi' thy hand to me— To, ‘Mary Ludgate’ LINES—TO HELEN MARIA 1 Helen Maria! lovely Helen! Ere the foliage leaves the tree, Ere the snow storm hides the dwelling, Take a country walk with me, In thy sunday shawl, and gown; With thy best straw bonnet on, Let us leave the tiresome town, And go where love and summer's gone— 2 Go to the grove of willows grey, That lean upon the rivers side, Where the green flag's, rustling play, And the wild duck, wanders wide: Where the old oak, darkly green, Shows autumn in a yellow bough; Helen Maria seek the scene, With health upon thy bonny brow. 3 And we, will mark the river run, And fishes leap above the stream, All golden with the Autumn sun, How happy will the journey seem! How happy will thy bosom be! To feel the kiss so softly prest: If Helen loves—walk out with me, We in each others hearts shall rest. To ‘Helen Maria Gardiner’— TO JULIA 1 Dear Julia! now the new mown hay Is littered o'er the narrow path, We'll in the meadows spend the day, And sit upon the scented swath; We'll rest upon the fragrant hay, Dear Julia! in the willows shade; In fond affection spend the day: And there I'll love my bonny maid 2 The knap weed falls before the scythe, And clumps of tawney meadow sweet, Ploughmen in fallows, whistle blythe, Where I, and bonny Julia meet. How sweetly cool the river runs! How richly green the flags appear! More yellow than the brightest suns, The sweetest place in all the year— 3 We'll gather lamb toes in the grass Brown tanned and hot as Julia's face, And Burnet flower, a tawney lass, And rattles like a pencil case That sound and rattles in the hand, For which the village boys will run: For these I'll sea[r]ch about the land, And walk with Julia in the sun— 4 Dear Julia! now the new mown hay Is littered oer the narrow path, We'll in the meadows spend the day, And walk among the scented swath, Dear Julia! in the willow's shade, We'll sit upon the fragrant hay, And there I'll clasp my peerless maid, And love, and live throughout the day. To ‘Julia Wiggington’ SWEET JENNY JONES 1 Oh clear, sweet, and bonny are April's gay mornings, And loud sings the Blackbird, all i' the green wood: And sweet is the maiden, in nature's adornings, With whom on the even o' Sunday, I stood; Soft was her gown o' silk, and black was the gloss on't, And red was her rose cheek, with hues a' its own, The heath sward was velvet, and goud was the gorse on't, When I went out walking wi sweet Jenny Jones. 2 How sweet was the heath, wi its pile wort and daizeys, And slopes filled wi furze bush, and every such thing: How green the spring comes, there what sunshiny places, How loudly the thrushes, and blackbirds, do sing, There young Jenny rambled, i' the beauties o' nature, Where the brook it went limping o'er pebbles, and stones, There I claspt in my arms, the most beautiful creature, The rosy, and bonny lass, sweet Jenny Jones. 3 The gouden hued gorse blossoms, glittering wi dew, The pigeon winged orchis, o' mulberry stain, The Bracken, and blue bell, o' heavens own hue: How sweetly they bloom on the wild heath again, How bonny, and fair, was the face o' my true love, How sweet was her voice, with its musical tones, How white was her breast, when her smiles first I knew love, I'm bewitched wi the beauty o' sweet Jenny Jones. 4 Oh clear, sweet and bonny, are first April mornings, And loud sings the Blackbird, who sits on yon thorn; And sweet is young Jenny in natures adornings, While walking the dewy heath soon in the morn, Oh how I adore thee my beautiful Jenny! Whose small feet go tripping the brooks stepping stones, You're the loveliest, dearest, and fairest of any, My beautiful, bonny lass, sweet Jenny Jones. SONG [Sweet comes the morning] 1 Sweet comes the morning, In natures adorning, And bright shines the dew, on the buds o' the thorn, Where Mary Ann rambles, Through sloe trees, and brambles, She's sweeter than wild flowers that open at morn; She's a rose i' the dew love, Nothing's sweeter than true love, She's as gay as the poppy, that grows in the corn. 2 Her eyes they are bright love, Her bosom's snow white love, And her voice is like songs o' the birds in the grove: She's handsome, and bonny, And fairer than onny, And her person and actions, are natures, and love, She has the bloom o' a' roses, She is the breath o' sweet posies, She's a' pure as the brood i' the nest o' the dove. 3 O' earths fairest daughters, Voiced like falling waters, She walks down the meadows, than blossoms more fair, Oh her bosom, right fair is, And her rose cheek, so rare is, And parted, and lovely, her glossy black hair: Her bosom's soft whiteness, The sun in its brightness, Has never been seen, so bewitchingly fair. 4 The dewy grass glitters, The house swallow twitters, And through the sky floats, in its visions o' bliss, The lark soars on high, On cowslips the dews lie, And the best day's o' summer, are nothing like this: When Mary Ann rambles, Th[r]oug[h] hedge rows, and brambles, The soft gales o' Spring are the seasons o' bliss. I'LL DREAM ABOUT THE DAYS TO COME 1 I'll lay me down on the green sward, Mid yellow cups, and speed well blue, And pay the world no real regard, But be to nature, leal, and true, What breaks the peace o' hapless man, But they who truth, and nature wrong? I'll hear na mair o evils plan, But live wi nature, and her song. 2 Where natures lights, and shades are green, Where natures peace, is strewn wi flowers, Where strife, and noise, is never seen, There I'll retire to happy hours, And stretch my body on the green, And sleep amang her flowers in bloom, By eyes of malice, seldom seen, And dream upon, the days to come. 3 I'll lay me by the forest green, I'll lay me on the pleasant grass, My life shall pass away unseen, I'll be no more the man I was, The tawney bee upon the flower, The butterfly upon the leaf, Like them I'll live my happy hour, A life of sunshine, bright, and brief. 4 In greenwood hedges, close at hand, Buildeth and sings the little birds, The happiest things in the green land, While sweetly feed the lowing herds, While softly bleat, the roving sheep, Upon the green grass will I lie, A summer day, to think, and sleep, Or see the clouds sail down the sky. HE LOVED ME BEST O' ONY'— 1 The path that led across the fiel Foot printed, dry, and clean, Crept snake like in its trail, Through meadows crisp, and green; I hung upon my sweethearts arm, Whose face was red, and bonny, He said, as love began to warm: He loved me best o' ony. 2 He said so, as he wiped away, The hair upon his brow, It was the happy first o' May And I'd just milked the cow, The rose just peeped, and on the brere, It scented blithe, and bonny; He softly said, my Mary dear I love you best o' ony. 3 He pluck'd some cowslips, from the grass, From white thorn bush, the May, And said ‘look here my bonny lass, What hues the flowers display.’ And then I hid them in my gown, All in my breast, so bonny, I took them with me, to the town, They're the sweetest flowers o' ony. 4 The clouds hung over Lolham brigs, The sunshine glittered through the arch, The ploughboy play'd his rustic rigs, And cawing crows, sat on the larch. He kiss't me on the neck, and cheek, Wi face sae red, and bonny, And said, ‘no mair he dare to speak But he loved me best o' ony.’ To ‘Mary Hobbs’ SHE IS A WINSOME YOUNG THING 1 My blossom is a young thing, Just like a budding daisy, That come a'most afore spring, She makes a body crazy: She's such a winsome young thing, She's such a bonny young thing, She's like a bonny daisy bud, That comes afore the spring. 2 My sweet young May's got house, and land, My sweet young May's got sheep, and kye, There's not a maid in a Scotland: Wi fairer face, and brighter eye, My bonny handsome young thing! My dearest sweetest young thing! There's not a flower in a' the spring, Like my ain dearest young thing. 3 She's one year coming out her teens, Just on the eve of blooming, And fairer than the first o' Queens, Just ripening to a woman, My bonny handsome young thing! My winsome dainty young thing! There's not a flow'r in a' the spring, Like my ain beauteous young thing. 4 She's big, as ony womans size, She's shapit like some bonny queen, Her rose red cheeks, and blue bell eyes, Are aye the sweetest, e'er was seen, She is a winsome young thing! She is a bonny young thing! The sweetest blossom o' the spring, Is my ain handsome young thing. To Miss Cook THE BONNY MAPLE TREE 1 O the bonny maple tree! O the handsome maple tree! There's not a tree in a' the wood, Can match the maple tree. The thrush will build her nest there, The maid is oft cares[s]t there, By the shepherd she is prest there, O the bonny maple tree! 2 O the ribb'd bark'd maple tree! O the winsome maple tree! I love the black blotch'd yellow leaves, O' the Autumns maple tree. The siller dew drop, nestles there, The blue bell drops her tassels there, The unfledged linnet nestles there, I' the mossy maple tree. 3 O the bonny maple tree! What a squatty, mossy stub, And seeds like wings o' dragon flies, With one end like a club. For there's the bugles rattle flowers, Where butterflies, will settle hours, Beneath the moss stump, scallop towers, O the bonny maple tree. 4 O the bonny maple tree! O the handsome shady maple tree! There's not a bird in a' the wood, But loves the maple tree, May the school boy, miss and spare em, And the speckled thrushes, rear em, In the nest, above the arum, On the bonny maple tree— TO MELANCHOLY Come maiden sad—of sorrows and of sighs Pale melancholy! with the downcast look, Come when the dewy eve the landscape dyes: The church yard yew we'll pass, and gurgling brook, And see the snow white moth, on stilly breeze, Dance by the spinney hedge, &amp; through the leaves. While the dull visions trouble, and deceives Thy soul with troubles all thine own: The stilly eve, thy secret woe receives. Maiden thou'rt like the church yards mossy stone, Thou readest thy troubles to the world unknown, Thy kind face soothes all sorrow save thine own. HAIL DREARY NOVEMBER 1 Hail! dreary November, Full well I remember, Thy wild roaring tempest, when I was a child, My heart ne'er was weary, My face was aye cheery, The loud roaring lynn, and the mountains so wild. 2 The wild raving thunder, The woods rolling under, The lake rolling billows, like waves of the sea, Tis the music of nature, In her stormiest feature, But the sweetest of music, is freedom for me. 3 Where the muir cock is housing, And the black cattle browsing, And the tempest is misting, o'er mountain and glen, There I think o' sweet Jinney, My joy and my hinney, Oh I mourn, that I ever left Scotland agen. 4 Hail! dreary November, Thy storms I remember, That roar'd round the shieling, when I was a child, I still love thy mountains, Thy lakes and thy fountains, Thy maidens so lovely, and valleys so wild— TO ISABEL— 1 Arise, my Isabel, arise, The sun shoots forth his early ray, The hue of love, is in the skies, The birds are singing, come away! Oh come! my Isabella come! With inky tendrils, hanging low, Thy cheeks like hedge rose, just in bloom, That in the healthy summer glow. 2 That eye it turns the world away From wanton ways, &amp; recklessness, That eye beams with a cheerful ray, And smiles propitiously to bless, Oh come! my Isabella dear! Oh come! and fill these longing arms, Come let me see thy beauty here, And bend in worship, oer thy charms. 3 Oh come! my Isabella love! My dearest Isabella come! Thy loves affection let me prove, And kiss thy beauty, in its bloom, My Isabella young, and fair, Thou darling of my home, and heart, Come love my bosoms truth to share, And of its being, form a part. To Isabella Sharp THE NURSERY GARDEN 1 There is an hidden history, in the trees, The various shades of green, and shapes of leaves, The nursery grounds, all stirred with the mild breeze, My mind from lonesome weariness relieves, Leaf shedding some, midst evergreen young firs, Whisper, and talk to every wind which stirs. 2 I love the nursery calm—or stirr'd by winds, Sweet chesnut, beech, and broad leaf'd sycamore, Fruit trees, and shrubs, and trees of various kinds, While o'er the varied scene the wind waves o'er; The poplar, broom, and oak that trees excel, The nursery—Oh! I love the nursery well! 3 I love the nursery, with its trees and bushes, Where gold beak'd blackbirds build their nests &amp; fly, To hear neath pine clumps shade, the singing thrushes, Hiding her Heaven tint eggs, from every eye, I love the nursery with its shades of green, At early morn, or in calm eve serene. 4 The nuts, and filberts with their soft broad leaves, Throw shadows on the path of russet brown, The willows grey, a summer chaplet weaves, For nights dull visions, when the sun goes down, I love the nursery, with its paths and trees, Its songs of birds, and summer panting bees. 5 I love the nursery, 'tis a pleasant place, To spend ones leisure hours, on summer's day, To mark the various tree's, throughout the space, Noting dark clumps, where leaves exclude bright day, I love the nursery, where the breezes leave, A whispering song of melody at eve. MY BEAUTIFUL RUTH 1 In the greenness and freshness of may, All calm, as the whisperings of truth, Thou'rt the star of my soul all the day, My lovely! my beautiful Ruth! The birds they are singing all round, While the sun shines, so warm on the ground, Lakes ripple in verges of gold, Where the king cups, and daisy's unfold. 2 Neath the white thorn, that's covered wi May, With my arm round her neck, for an hour, I'd court her there, through half the day, Then hasten to pluck the wild flower, The cowslip I'd place in her breast, The roses shall bloom on her cheek, Of her whom my heart loves the best, For no other than her will I seek. 3 With my lips on her beautiful cheek, Breathing love in fond kisses, and sighs, I could court her, and kiss her a week, For the light o' the heaven's in her eyes, The brook floweth happily by, Where the cowslip is seen, in the flood, Reflected where calmly they lie, On the ground where Ruth happily stood. 4 She stood like a pastoral Queen, She smil'd like an angel o' light, The grass it grows bright in her e'en, On a moonlight, and beautiful night, All is quiet—and sleepeth the noize, I love her in heart, and in truth, And nothing can equal my joys, When I clasp to my bosom fond Ruth. To—Ruth Tennant FRAGMENT [Vetches; both yellow, and blue] Vetches; both yellow, and blue, Grew thick in the meadow lane, Isabellas shawl kept off the dew, As thickly upon her it came, A thorn bush caught her umbrella, As though it would bid her to stay, But the loving, and loved Isabella, Went laughing, and walking away. THE WINTERS COME 1 Sweet chesnuts brown, like soleing leather turn, The larch trees, like the colour of the sun, That paled sky in the Autumn seem'd to burn. What a strange scene before us now does run, Red, brown, and yellow, russet black, and dun, White thorn, wild cherry, and the poplar bare, The sycamore all withered in the sun, No leaves are now upon the birch tree there, All now is stript to the cold wintry air. 2 See! not one tree but what has lost its leaves, And yet, the landscape wears a pleasing hue, The winter chill on his cold bed receives, Foliage which once hung oer the waters blue, Naked, and bare, the leafless trees repose, Blue headed titmouse now seeks maggots rare, Sluggish, and dull, the leaf strewn river flows, That is not green, which was so through the year, Dark chill November draweth to a close. 3 'Tis winter! and I love to read in-doors, When the moon hangs her crescent upon high: While on the window shutters the wind roars, And storms like furies pass remorseless by, How pleasant on a feather bed to lie, Or sitting by the fire, in fancy soar, With Milton, or with Dante to regions high, Or read fresh volumes we've not seen before, Or o'er old Bartons ‘melancholy pore.’ ARABELLA SEYMOUR 1 Oh for the glow of Titian Or Shakesperes wondrous themes I then might sing of what thou art The beautiful of dreams Thine eye the language of the soul What eloquence can vie With their calm light which beauty stole Whose spirit makes reply 2 The immortality of mind The happy face reveals And something more than earthly love Upon the gazer steals These lips are full of pastoral thoughts How beautiful they are The ripest cherries on the tree Nor rubies are so fair 3 Sweet Arabella blooming on Of Seymour's name the star That shines in aether spangling on The loveliest beauty far Oh for a Titian's tints to glow And Shakespeares pen to move How would I sing thy name below The beautiful of Love— THE VILLAGE BELLE 1 The happy thorn bushes were just in their greenest And green was the meadow bank greener the lea The sun on the rippling lake shone the serenest But the belle in the meadow's the beauty for me Her bra' gown it waved in the gales o the morning And her strippit ribbons they fluttered so gay Her face was all beauty o' natures adorning As she went to the fair by the hedge rows o' may 2 As soon as she pass't me the fields turn'd a' gloomy The green grass seem'd naething so green as before The flowers lost their colours erewhile they were bloomy And the sunshine na pleasured my fancy na more I left the green holly and follow'd the maiden And soon overtook her beneath the elm tree With blushes and beauty her features were laden But I dare not tell what she granted to me 3 Bright again shone the flowers the daisy &amp; pilewort That studded the grass every inch of the way I kiss't her ripe lips, and got a sweet smile for't Oh she blushed like a rose all the rest o' the day The meadows were all in bright butter cups glaring Green again was the grass and bright blue was the sky I vow on next may day to give her a fairing Should she have the kindness to pass this way by HYMN [Father of all the life and light] 1 Father of all the life and light Of all created space The planets fixed in heaven bright The brute and human race Father creator life and love Of all thine hands have made The Lord below the God above I ever need thy aid 2 Thy grace all evil things to shun And troubles to endure Oh let thy blessing on us come A sovereign balm and cure To heal the heart opprest by wrong To rise the sinking soul Inspire me with an heavenly song Me let not sin control 3 I ask not worldly fame to win Nor earth's delights to share These are the deadly baits of sin Lord shew the hidden snare In rectitude my footsteps guide Lest they to ruin lead The night is dark the world is wide Lord help me to proceed 4 The amours vain of lawless love The harlots stubborn pride My aims exalt to realms above With wisdom for my guide In other worlds my hopes shall lie With excellence and thee My home shall be beyond the sky With God the Deity— SONG [The cows they are out in the pasture] 1 The cows they are out in the pasture Where the maids go a milking at e'en Untroubled by a common disaster In every village they're seen On the white thorn the cobweb is hinging The knob weeds blood red on the hill By the dyke yellow hammers are singing Milkmaids sing more beautiful still How sweet smells the hawthorn how lovely the scene Where the beautiful maidens go milking at e'en 2 The cows are all out in the pasture The Hedge sparrow chirps in the thorn And there is the man with his master Looking over the clover and corn The milk maid looks like the hedge roses When fi[r]st they begin to unclose Her eyes are as bright as blue posies That all down the pasture path grows How sweet smells the hawthorn how lovely the scene Where the beautiful maidens go milking at e'en 3 The blackbird sings sweet in the vale While the ring dove is cooing beyond And the wagtail whose wagging his tail Catches midges that fly oer the pond The gnats from the rushes fly up In a column that toutches the sky At the cow pond the heifer will stop While the swallow goes merrily by How sweet look the maidens with aprons so clean And their well scoured pails going milking at e'en SUNDAY AT NOON 1 How sweet is a stroll in the field With the pease and bean blossoms in bloom What a sweet smelling fragrance they yield As they bloom on a Sunday at noon Oh I love the footpath that takes To the clear gravel brook on its way I walk on its banks for it makes A beautiful saunter in May Where the Lamb toe clumps still Red and yellows each hill And the brook whimpling music the whole summers day 2 'Twas on a sweet sunday at noon Delightfully sweet was the hour The wild rose was just in its bloom And a humble bee crept in the flower The water like silver ran by And gulped oer the pebbles and stones Like silk did the seeded grass lie Oer which the wind softly oft moans The mossy stones wemble The bowed rushes tremble And the chafed waters murmer their sighs &amp; their groans 3 'Twas a beautiful sunday at noon And not one of the sheep seem'd afraid I'd got on my best sunday shoon And was in my new clothing array'd All the fields had their green Jackets on Oh they never looked gayer than then On that day with its bright glowing sun Oh when will they bloom so agen And the silk reeded grass Shading brooks clear as glass Oh it whispers sweet music to children of men FRAGMENT [Love's memories haunt my footsteps still] Love's memories haunt my footsteps still Like ceaseless flowings of the river Its mystic depths say what can fill?

COLLINGWOOD 1 Oh Mary gentle Mary let us not disagree I took thee for my true love to share thy company Relentless fate pursued me and sent me cross the sea But there sweet Mary Collingwood was all the world to me At last when I came back again after staying months away Her absence was made up to me by the pleasure of that day To look upon that sweet face where fell the silent tear Recompenced the absence I'd been away a year 2 That by gone year has perish'd with every absent day When we all lonely hearted from each other liv'd away The flowers bloom'd in France like to our English spring Birds sang but Mary Collingwood wasn't by to hear them sing Flowers bloom Birds sing at Springs return again But none like English primroses e'er grew in France or Spain They look all neat and smell so sweet all down among the gorse Where Mary looks for violets in the green wood velvet moss 3 The white thorn shews her leaf and the bud is on the brere Where once we pluck'd wild roses at the July of the year Where once we gather'd honey suck the finch doth build a nest I rubb'd the prickles off the rose and plac'd it in her breast Roses have bloom'd sae sweet and fair upon this lovely spot Yet

Sundays in the morn And prov'd it in a thousand ways While walking through the corn I pull'd her as she stept the stile Back just to kiss her cheek She just rebuk'd me by a smile I felt it all the week 2 With stick before I beat the dew Where heavy laid the grain For black and glossy was her shoe Her new gown without stain I put the envious brier away That dangled for her sleeve And cut the bramble from the spray That they no wounds might leave 3 I met my love in Summer weather And wandered down the lane Like Turtle Doves we pair'd together And shall do so again The moon may peep when skies are bare O' clouds, and stars may shine They'll see nought else but love is there I'm hers, and she is mine— SHE'S CHASTE AND BEAUTIFULLY FAIR 1 How dear to me the wild rose tree That in the

upon its spray And there all wi' his ruddy breast Is sitting on its lichen nest 2 How beautiful the wild rose tree In green close hedges how they shine I look at them and think of thee My Mary with thy face divine Thy face it hath the roses blush Thine eyes are bright as mornings dew Thy heart—The chaffinch in the bush Is innocent and artless too Sweet Mary wi the dark brown hair You're chaste and beautifully fair 3 Let me upon thy bosom lean Let thy white bosom ease my cares True love well knows what sorrows mean And heals and cures them unawares I kiss my Mary's blushing cheek I languish

comes from the willows And sweet is the rustle o' sedges and reeds That grow in the river make muddy the billows That swells up in volumes thro' rushes and weeds Wi bosom as soft as the down o' the pillows Wi a waist just an armful for lovers to span Come love and we'll walk down the groves o grey willows And forget all the world and its cares if we can 2 Red are thy cheeks and ruby thy pouting lips Thine eyes are as bright as the summer sun beams There's a mole on her breast like the cup o' cowslips Was I but a fairy in mid summer dreams I'd kiss it and dream on't the whole of the summer I' the midst of the white lily beds where it lay Like a bee on a flower whose a beautiful hummer It's sweet to the eye when the kerchiefs away 3 How sweet is the whisper by moonlight or even From the lips o' a beauty whose whispering to thee She's the light o' my soul a picture o' heaven The moon wi' her face in the waters I see So softly my hand lay upon her white shoulder 'Twas pleasant to look on and lovely to be By the side o' my Lucy and sweet to behold her There's no one her equal in this Countree THE SAILORS RETURN 1 The white thorn is budding and rushes are green The Ivy leaves rustle around the ash tree On the sweet sunny bank blue violets are seen That tremble beneath the wild hum of the bee The sun beams they play on the brooks plashy ripples Like millions o' suns in each swirl looping on The rush nods and bows till its tassel'd head tipples Right into the whimpled flood kissing the stones 2 'Twas down in the cowpasture just at the gloaming I met a young woman sweet tempered and mild I said pretty maiden say where are you roaming I'm walking at even she answer'd and smiled ‘Here my sweetheart and I gather'd posies at even ‘Its eight years ago sin they sent him to sea Wild

1 Why are ye silent Birds where do ye fly Winters not violent Wi such a spring sky The wheatlands are green snow &amp; frost is away Birds why are ye silent on such a sweet day 2 By the slated pigstye The red breast whispers Where brown leave's lye The hedge sparrow lispers But why is the chaffinch and bullfinch so still While the sulphur primroses bedeck the wood hill 3 The bright yellowhammers Are strutting about All still and none stammers A single note out From the hedge starts the Blackbird at brookside to drink I thought he'd have whistled but he only said prink 4 The tree creeper hustles Up firs rusty bark All silent he bustles We needn't say hark There's no song in the forest in field or in wood Though the sun gilds the grass as tho' come in for good 5 February the tenth and Even sparrows scarce chirp The lark in the bents ran And dodging round whirp All silent they winnow o'er grass i the glen Then drop like a stone i' the stibbles agen 6 How bright the odd daisies Peep under the stubbs How bright pilewort blazes Where riddled sheep rubs The old willow trunk by the side o' the brook Where soon for Blue Violets the children will look 7 By the cot green and mossy Feed sparrows and hens On the ridge brown and glossy They chirp now and then The wren cocks his tail oer his back by the sty Where his green bottle nest will be made by &amp; by 8 Here's bunches o chickweed Wi' small starry flow'rs Where Red caps oft pick seed From weeds in Spring hours And Blue Cap and Black Cap in glossy spring coat A peeping in buds wi' out singing a note 9 Why silent? should birds be And sunshine so warm Larks hide where the herds be By cottage and farm If wild flowers were blooming &amp; fully set in the Spring Maybe all the Birdies would cheerfully sing— THE YELLOWHAMMER When shall I see the white thorn leaves agen And Yellowhammers gath'ring the dry bents By the Dyke side on stilly moor or fen Feathered wi love and natures good intents Rude is the nest this Architect invents Rural the place wi cart ruts by dyke side Dead grass, horse hair and downy headed bents Tied to dead thistles she doth well provide Close to a hill o' ants where cowslips bloom And shed o'er meadows far their sweet perfume In early Spring when winds blow chilly cold The yellow hammer trailing grass will come To fix a place and choose an early home With yellow breast and head of solid gold HIM WHO LOVES THEE BEST 1 Oh come to him who loves thee best Oh come to him who loves thee Thy bosom be his place of rest Thine eyes like heaven above thee Oh come to him that loves thee best My Susan come to him Wi gown as crimson as the west Straw hat and ribbons trim 2 The dew is on the primrose pale And on the white thorn buds Oh come wi me and walk the vale And honeysuckle woods Let thy young spirit fancy me With mine the hours employ As one let us together be All happiness!

I eyed the maid all over As I pass'd her in the grain Then I hasten'd through the clover And the Heav'n was dropping rain I kisst her on the cheek so red Her neck was soft and white She heeded every word I said And felt that it was right 4 We lay together side by side Around us grew the wheat She'd make a bonny winsome bride The woodbines wer'nt so sweet We saw the sun drop in the wood The stars light up the eve The moon got up wi dewy hood Before we took our leave 5 There's pleasure in the sweet greenwood Wi a sweet girl by ones side To think of it it does one good And fills our heart wi pride To walk amang the silken grass To kiss her rosy face Courting till eve the bonny lass In such a fitting place MEET ME TO NIGHT 1 Oh meet me to night by the bright starlight Now the pleasant spring's begun My own dear maid by the greenwood shade I' the crimson set o' the sun Meet me to night 2 The sun he goes down wi a ruby crown To a gold and crimson bed And the falling dew from heaven so blue Hang[s] like pearls on Phoebe's head Love leave the town 3 Come thou with me neath the green leaf tree We'll crop the bonny sweet brere Oh come dear maid neath the hazle wood shade For love invites us here Come then wi' me 4 The Owl pops scarce seen from the Ivy green Wi' his spectacles on I ween See the moon above and stars twinkle love Better time was never seen Oh come my queen 5 The fox he stops and down he pops His head beneath the grass The birds are gone we're all alone Oh stay my bonny lass Come! Oh come! ANGELS OF EARTH 1 Love is the immortal souls delight For ‘God is love’ we see I love His seasons day and night His world so fair and free The evening breeze and morning gale And Gods own masterpiece Woman! Thy joys can never fail Our pleasures to increase 2 I loved sweet woman from a boy They are Gods types o' love Wi' bosoms white all full o' joy Wafting our thoughts above Angels o' earth though made wi clay Love clippit o' the wing To them I sang my early lay Continue still to sing 3 Their soft eyes tell o' bliss in heaven Sweet are the words they say In their sweet smile the power is given To cheer our lonely way Their rosy cheeks and lips I loved Their diamond eyes I sung My songs of love by them approved By them my harp was strung 4 Creations masterpiece is woman! Of lifes dark sphere the soul Queen o' every blossom bloomin A light to charm the whole Angels of earth tho' made of clay Loves type without a wing My first as last immortal lay Is woman! when I sing COME AS IT MAY COME 1 Oh come as it will come or come if it shall come If Sally but smiles the winter turns spring Come joy or come sorrow if t'will come &amp; welcome Let my Sally smile on while my ballads I sing I'll sing o' the Hawthorn and grove o' grey willows Where Sally and I sat a courting all day When I kiss'd her red cheeks oer two snowy pillows Not one word o' resentment she found for to say— 2 So come love as t'will come if crosses shall come True love is like water pure rinning along The rocks and the shallows at all times are welcome Wet or dry they are welcome in loves happy song For Sally is fair she's bewitchingly handsome Her bosom's white lilys her cheeks the red rose If her last words were cold still to love her I am come True love like a siller brook murmers &amp; flows 3 Come weal or come woe come sorrow or gladness Come blackness what matters if Sally but smile With her I'll be happy tho puzzled to madness And find that her ransom is worth all my toil Oh Sally my darling sweet beautiful Sally Thy bosom I vow is the throne o' Loves joy To trifle with thee or one moment to dally Deserves not the least o' thy smiles to enjoy 'TWAS WI' SADNESS O' HEART 1 'Twas wi' sadness o' heart that my love and I parted Tears fell on a rock as wheels they turn'd round When I took a last kiss and felt nigh broken hearted And then to Leith harbour my journey was bound 'Twas to better our fortune and feel more contented And to go board a ship that I journeyed that day The first and last time that I ever repented And the childer to school were sent out o' the way 2 The morning was rough and snow round the pier head Fell covering the rigging as white as a sheet My childer were many I couldn't buy ‘dear bread’ Sae I went for a sailor better wages to meet The little blue bell flower the friend o' my childhood That grew where my dog snappt the flies fra his feet Mid the heather and broom by the side o' the wild wood My tears dropt amang them 'twas no use to greet 3 Sae my heart it took courage for Sailors were wanted And I boarded a Merchant man ready to sail My money was asked and the wages were granted But the thoughts o' my true love they made me turn pale Auld Scotland receded her vales and her mountains Till they look'd little more than the palm o' ones hand I turn'd a last look when I thought o her fountains But the clouds stood a'tween us no sight o the land 4 Then I plucked up my heart at sight o' the ocean I thought o' my wife and the children the same And I felt in my breast an uneasy commotion And I paled in my face as it went and it came My childer all tattered their mother in tears These dear links o' memory are never forgot The day wasn't spent I might be away years But I answered myself 'tis to better my lot 5 The sea dog he bobb'd up his head like a buoy And down by our sails rudely flappd the sea gull But my heart ne'er o'erfed by contentment and joy Was ready to burst wi its trouble sae full The big billows roll'd o'er the deck o' the ship I fear'd twas a wreck tho 'twas “only a storm” The sailors around me were drinking their flip Took not the least notice nor any alarm 6 Two years and nine months sin the day we first started We toutch'd at both Indies and then hurried hame Wi a bag full o gold well rigg'd and light hearted To Ould bonny Scotland we voyaged again The heath bells I left all their blue joys repeated Still bloom'd by the fountain &amp; smil'd i the dell I kiss'd wife &amp; childer wi kindness were greeted My wife gave me cause she behaved so well ADIEU 1 Adieu! my love adieu! Be constant and be true As the daiseys gemm'd wi dew Bonny Maid Dews are on the braken Which the playful winds are shaking Sweet songs the birds are making In the shade 2 The moss upon the tree Is as green as green can be The clover on the lea Ruddy glowed Leave's were silver wi the dew Where the tall sow thistles grew And I bad the maid adieu On the road 3 Then I took myself to sea While the little chiming bee Sung his ballads oe'r the lea Chiming sweet And the blue wing'd butterfly Was sailing through the sky Skimming up and bouncing by Near my feet 4 I left the little birds And sweet lowing o the herds And couldn't find out words Do you see To say to them goodbye Where the yellow cups do lye So heaving a deep sigh Took to sea PERPLEXITIES 1 I talk to the birds as they sing i' the morn The larks and the Sparrow's that spring from the corn The Chaffinch and Linnet that sings in the bush Till the zephyr like breezes all bid me to hush Then silent I go and in fancy I steal A kiss from the lips of a name I conceal But should I meet her I've cherish'd for years I pass by in silence in fondness and fears 2 Yes I pass her in silence and say not a word And the noise o' my footsteps may scarcely be heard I scarcely presume to cast on her my eye And then for a week I do nothing but sigh If I look on a wild flower I see her face there There it is in its beauty all radient and fair And should she pass by I've nothing to say We are both of us silent &amp; have our own way 3 I talk to the birds the wind and the rain My love to my dear one I never explain I talk to the flower's which are growing all wild As if one was herself and the other her child I utter sweet words in my fanciful way But if she come's by I've nothing to say To look for a kiss I would if I dare But I feel myself lost when near to my fair— THE MOSSY GREEN LANE 1 The cock chafer hums down the rut rifted lane Where the wild roses hang and the woodbines entwine And the shrill squeaking Bat makes his circles again Round the side of the Tavern close by the sign The sun is gone down like a wearysome queen In curtains the richest that ever were seen 2 The dew falls on flowers in a mist o' small rain And beating the hedges low fly the barn owls The moon wi her horns is low peeping again And deep in the forest the dog badger howls In best bib and tucker then wanders my Jane By the side o' the woodbines which grow in the lane 3 On a sweet summer Eve tide I walk by her side In green hood the daiseys have shut up their eyes Young Jenny is handsome wi'out any pride Her eyes oh how bright! have the hue o' the skies Oh tis pleasant to walk by the side o' my Jane At the close o' the day down the mossy green lane 4 We stand by the brook by the gate and the stile While the even star hangs out his lamp in the sky And on his calm face dwells a sweet sunny smile While her soul fondly speaks through the light o' her eye Sweet are these moments while waiting for Jane Tis her footsteps I hear coming down the green lane THE PITCHER WITHOUT EAR 1 In Scotaland there's a bonny place Where a little spring is found There nature shows her honest face The whole year round Where the white thorn branches full o' may Hang where the fountains rin Where comes sweet Alice every day And dips her pitcher in A gallon pitcher wi out ear She fills it with the water clear 2 My bonny Alice she is fair There's no sic other to be found Her rosey cheek and dark brown hair The fairest maid on Scotlands ground And there the heathers pin head flowers All blossom over bank and brae While Alice passes by the bowers To fill her pitcher every day The pitcher brown wi out a ear She dips into the fountain clear 3 Oh Alice bonny sweet and fair Wi roses on her cheeks The little birds come drinking there The throstle almost speaks He dips his wings and wrinkles makes Upon the fountain clear Then vanishes among the brakes For ever singing near While Alice listening stands to hear And dips the pitcher without ear 4 Oh Alice bonny Alice fair Thy pleasant face I love Thy red rose cheek thy dark brown hair Thy soft eyes like a dove I see thee by the fountain stand Wi the sweet smiling face Theres not a maid in a' the land Wi such bewitching grace As Alice who is drawing near To dip the pitcher wi' out ear DRESS DOES NOT MAKE THE MAN 1 My love is like the white thorn tree When its leaves are blown away His cheeks are red as haw berry His dress is never gay 2 My love is like the Bramble bushes Whose leaves lie on the ground While hes sitting on the rushes His looks have power to wound 3 His dress—that does not make the man In one dress all the year Wi coarse smock frock as brown as tan He does at Church appear 4 I knew him when a Shepherd boy His dress was hodden grey But his plump cheeks of health and joy Stole all my heart away— MY EVERLASTING LOVE 1 My love is like the Gilliflower I planted by mysell My love is like a Willowflower A blossom wi'out smell 2 How sweet and very fair my love Like diamonds are her eyes Like dew drops sparkling from above That on the white rose lies 3 Her cheeks are like the Red rose tree Her bosom like the white Her thoughts from Heaven surely be To give to man delight 4 Her voice is like the nightingale Her bosom like the Dove She shall be in this one tale My Everlasting love— MY PEERLESS ADELAIDE 1 How swift the rack flies through the sky How mild the clouds sail on The cutting hail has rattled by The winters storms are gone Then walk my peerless Adelaide Not in a Coronet But in thy dress of simple braid The fairest maiden yet Like sun in darkness light in shade Walk forth my peerless Adelaide 2 The Pilewort blazes by the way The daisey's silver stars Shed gold and silver light all day In green that nothing mars The Primrose pale of Lemon hue Dew gemmed in mosses shade Gem like they glisten with the dew Walk forth sweet Adelaide Not as the coronetted Queen But in thy comely gown of green 3 The skylarks winnow through the cloud And whistle as they rise The Black Cap in the wood pipes loud The rack flies through the skies Swiftly it passes by my dear Palm sallows gild the shade Tis calm and pleasant everywhere Come forth my Adelaide In youth and beauty fresh and free Come forth my love and go with me COUNTRY COURTSHIP 1 It was on a summers morning Nigh the middle of the day When dewy pearls the Breres adorning Shone on the hedge row spray Just while a getting o'er the stile And the green bank stepping down I met a maiden wi sunny smile A coming from the town 2 The roses blush'd upon the Brere Her cheek flush'd wi the heat ‘Good morning to your smiles my dear Good Morn said she so sweet The wheat stalk showed its milky ear And bow'd down heavy o'er the baulk The birds they whistled full and clear The Jays they almost seem'd to talk 3 I said ‘my pretty maiden fair Excuse a strangers first love token I wiped aside her curling hair I kiss'd her cheek before twas spoken We pass'd o'er grounds &amp; cross'd the lane Her gown was brush'd by milky ear I saw her home and back again Went every sunday all the year 4 I went while wheat grounds turn'd to brown I went till stouks were standing there Head aches where blushing up and down And blue caps blossom'd late and fair I went till Bean fields were turn'd black And Barley shocks where clear'd away Saw Ruckyards fill'd wi many a stack And then we had our Wedding day— COME BONNY LUCY JANE 1 It was one April morning When pale Primroses shoot Hedge borders thick adorning The Hazels mossy root Where the Chaffinch builds her nest On the white thorn green I kiss'd the bonny breast O' my own dear Jean 2 In thy bonny buff gown Thy Hat o common straw We will wander up and down In love and natures law In thy bonny gown o' buff Thou'rt fair and fond again One kiss is not enough A hundred just as vain 3 By the bush nigh the fountain By rushes on the plain I'll kiss without counting Oer and oer again Come Lucy leave the town The Thorn bush is green The Daisies glitter round And Pilewort burns between 4 Then come bonny Lucy Oh hasten thy delay Oh do not refuse me But come love away Where little birds are singing To charm the scene Come dear this e'ening And be my Queen IN BEAUTY THERE IS JOY 1 In beauty there is joy for ever That fadeth not and never will It changeth not to sorrow never Its smiles are balm for every ill It burns in love from its own bosom Yet never melts those hills of snow The leaves of love for ever blossom Its roses never cease to blow 2 To me she is the sovreign queen The worship of my every hour Beauty wi love is ever seen Mid flowers growing in the bower Come forth sweet Rachel wi the spring Come forth my love and happy be For thou art beauty's lovely thing And I am deep in love with thee 3 The pilewort blazes in the grass The daiseys silver oer the lea Rachel come forth my lovely lass And we will both so happy be Come where the Linnet builds her nest Where green leaves deck once naked tree And thou shalt lean upon my breast Ill happy kisses give to thee EARLY MORNING 1 Primroses are in hedge rows peeping Neath white thorn roots violets are sleeping Dew bespangled they seem weeping In the early pleasant morning— 2 The Primrose peeps aneath the thorn By woodland hedges newly born Shows sulpher bosom in the morn The calm and tranquil morning— 3 The violets blooming neath the hedge Peeping in clumps thro wither'd sedge Of Spring the sweet and early pledge Sweet scenting early morning— 4 By Hazel Stulps and mossy green Where the bubbling brook is seen Oft you and I, in Spring have been Walking at early morning— 5 The Lark is cheeping to the sky A bursting flood of melody Till clouds conceal him from the eye In the mild and early morning— 6 The crow is on the furrow'd field The Blackbird in the spinney shield They in the Quick set hedges build Singing sweet at early morning— 7 The hanging mist the blebs of dew That makes the early pasture blue As if the Heaven was looking through To welcome early morning— 8 In such a place 'tis hard to sever We met and could have talked for ever In meadows by that winding river On that lovely early morning— 9 There thou a bonny maiden fair As sweet a flower as any there Went forth to take the healthy air I the quiet early morning— 10 Blessing's attend thy leisure hours May happiness descend in showers When Spring revives those fragrant bowers On a joyous April morning— SPRING 1 In every step we tread appears fresh spring Hedge weeds all juicy run up tall and flowers Birds near their nests in early morning sing By yonder Chaffinch there the Leveret cowers Unseen and nestles through the days warm hours Then plays at eve tide in the grass and dew The old field barn is based with wild spring flowers The old cart wheel agen the hovel threw Leans neath the thatch where last year robins flew 2 The summers messenger the sooty swallow O'er level meadows like a shadow swims Then darts with nimbler speed oer the brown fallow On o'er the farm within a minute skims His flight to mark the keenest vision dims Now o'er the green wheat field it playful springs Then oer the meadow field its flight begins There drops and drinks and twitters round &amp; sings The happiest welcomer of early spring 3 The children shout to see a swallow fly When they come first where the bow'd cowslips bloom Down valleys where lone lodge and hamlets lie They eager bawl and halloo ‘Here they come’ ‘And there they go’ as thoughts do to their home They hasten quickly to warm chimney pots Day after day the children watch them come The sight of swallow[s] their flower gathring stops Skiming the valley, brooks, through woods he pops 4 Above the Quick set blooms ‘Jack by the hedge’ His white flowers shine all down the narrow lane In April sunshine still a welcome pledge To show warm weather brings wild flowers again Primrose to woods and cowslips to the plain The Arum red or white their flower shows The grass gets darker with the sun and rain The yellow rocket by the dyke side grows And every wild weed in perfection glows— ACROSTIC [Jane summer is with thee thy fancy may chuse] Jane summer is with thee thy fancy may chuse Any amusement with thy sister the muse Nor meet dissappointment in walking the fields Endearing the pleasure that innocence yields Where wild flowers are blossoming sweet in their joy In Natures own scene where pleasures ne'er cloy Light as a summer day softly you tread Silent as evening o'er the daisey's bed O'er meadows by Woodside by Brooklets she speeds Ne'er gathering one of vain folly's weeds—

WILD FLOWERS 1 How Sweet are Spring wild flowers that grow past the counting How sweet are the wood paths that thread through the grove But sweeter than all the wild flowers o' the mountain Is the beauty that walks here The maiden I love Her black hair in tangles The Rose Briar mangles Her lips and soft cheeks Where Love ever speaks Oh theres nothing so sweet as the maiden I love 2 It was down in these wild flowers Among brakes &amp; brambles I met the sweet maiden so dear to my eye In one o' my Sunday morn midsummer rambles Among the sweet wild blossoms blooming close by Her hair it was coal black Hung loose down her back In her hand she held posies Of blooming Primroses The maiden who pass'd on the morning o' love 3 Coal black was her silk hair that shaded white shoulders Ruby red were her ripe lips—cheeks o' softer hue Her sweet smiles enchanting the eyes of beholders Won my heart as she rambled the wild blossoms through Like the pearl her bright eye In trembling delight I, Kisst her cheek like a rose In its sweetest repose Oh theres nothing so sweet as the maiden I love OH WHITHER FAIR MAIDEN 1 Oh whither fair maiden so soon in the morning In thy High Lows &amp; stockings as black as a coal Oh whither fair maiden in natures adorning Thy face has bewitch'd me both body and soul Im going to the village just over the tillage there Where the weather cock shines i' the gleam o' the sun Where the Jackdaws a choir build their nests i' the spire As soon as the Spring has its season begun 2 We pass'd the pale primrose beneath the wild Briar The sunbeams were playing in the arc of the sky The sweet smelling violet we stopped to admire That blossommed beneath every hedge we pass'd by Behind and before me I looked all around I saw no one near when I kiss'd her red cheek About her white neck I both my arms wound When she blush'd like a fire &amp; was ready to speak 3 The lace work o' spiders was beaded wi pearl The leaves of the clover were silvered wi' dew Where I took the white hand o' the innocent girl And led her the field and the spinney quite through The nuthatches ran down the bark o' the trees Ring Doves in the Ivy sat still in their nest And round the wet wild flow'rs whining round were the bees All choosing those blossoms which suited them best 4 Neath ribb'd maple stovens sweet lies the blue bell And Harrietts bosom bent low to the ground To crop two or three as she liked them so well How pleasantly fair all the scenery round In Sight o' the Cottage we sat on the stile Where I kiss'd her sweet lips in a thrill o' delight I had to return agen two or three mile But I promised at parting to meet her that night A RAPHSODY 1 Sweet solitude what joy to be alone In wild wood shady dell to stay for hours Twould soften hearts if they were hard as stone To see glad Butterflies &amp; smiling flowers Tis pleasant in these quiet lonely places Where not the voice of Man our pleasure mars To see the little bees with coal black faces Gath'ring sweets from little flowers like stars 2 The wind seems calling though not understood A voice is speaking Hark! it louder calls It echoes in the far outstretching wood First twas a hum but now it loudly squalls And then the pattering rain begins to fall And tis hush'd—the fern leaves scarcely shake The totter grass it scarcely stirs at all And then the rolling thunder gets awake And from black clouds the lightning flashes break 3 Tis the Spring thunder storm and do I fear Those bursting claps and bellowing agonies Of Thunder—I feel the earth shake here While Heav'ns Artillery rends the very skies Oh what a clap! Earth sent up no replies But shuddered—Another clap came louder then The lightning zigzagged in a lambent flame Birds were all mute—Earth sobb'd &amp; shook agen The grunting Badger hurried to his den And then there fell a bursting flood of rain 4 There is a fragrant freshness after showers In the warm noon that smells o' the green grass And herbage round almost as sweet as flowers Rain on Furze bushes hangs like drops of glass Beading the grass and bents upon the plain Drabbling through wet the hare &amp; rabbits pass Through the brown fern they come again There's health mid growing crops &amp; fragrance in the rain 5 And there is freshness in the morning dew With its mult[it]udinous drops of dusky glass Fields, hedges, meadows one wide view Of drops—Health in the very breezes as they pass The winding foot path &amp; the milking lass The green thorn hedges little stiles and brigs And shining lakes like sunshine upon glass The arches where the swimming swallow bigs Her nest—And ground Lark singing on land rigs 6 The Elm tree in its foliage wavers dull The Oak tree opens leaf—a lovely green Charming they look the wood is getting full Of leaf—The spreading Oak is seen In all varieties of darkest green The small leav'd Poplar when all leaves are still Trembles wi' Ague neath a sunny beam Swift as a Courser goes the distant mill And mournful waves the willow by the rill— 7 Theres sweet society in fields and woods Sweet are the pleasures mid the long love grass I' lakes and rivers and in widest floods That in the noon day shine like burnish'd glass I like the wild flowers where the lone bees hum The clouds which leave their shadows as they pass They through the sky like ships &amp; armies come I hail thee Nature as my heritage and home 8 The sunshine's gone &amp; now an April Evening Commences wi a dun and mackerel sky Gold light &amp; woolpacks in the west are leaving And leaden streaks their splendid place supply Sheep ointment seems to daub the dead hued sky And night shuts up the lightsomeness of day All dark &amp; absent like a corpses eye Flower, tree and bush like all the shadows grey In leaden hues of desolation fade away— 9 Then comes the darkness in its deeper stains Of midnight nothingness—nor sky nor earth Is seen—blank indistinctiveness—nought remains Of life—All stillness like to lonesome death The darkness thickens fear walks and stops her breath She dare not look behind—visions pursue— Unseen she travels oer the lonely heath And thinks it company to feel the dew Till travels done and home appears in view 10 Tis May and yet the March flower Dandelion Is still in bloom among the Emerald grass Shining like guineas with the suns warm eye on We almost think they are gold as we pass Or fallen stars on a green sea of grass The[y] shine in fields on waste grounds near the town They closed like painters brush when even was At length they turn to nothing else but down While the rude winds blow of[f] each shadowy crown 11 The woodbine in its blossoming all flowers Shedding its perfumes wi the evening dew Or early morn or after hasty showers How sweet they smelt while on the hedge they grew When I was seeking nests and nothing knew But flowers my pastime ye delightful hours How beautiful they are I dare not say adeiu To flowers there is a charm, a witching in flowers— Each spring is Heaven the rains and golden showers— 12 As twas at first so it is ever now The meadow King Cups and the daisey flower Thickly they shine before the grazing cow They seem to be the droppings of the shower How soft the wind comes through the white thorn bowers Each leaflet glistens with the pearls of rain They glitter in the sun of the soft hours The hedge row glistens with the pretty flowers The Lark sings clear mounting the sky again 13 The new fallen rain lies upon grassy spears Like beads or drops of pearl reviving all That the hot day doth swelter—Bright appears Again in wonted green The Larks loud call Again is heard above the Waterfall The trees drop water which to leaflet clings Bird answers bird with an harmonious note And the clear drops upon the tall grass hings Slaking the thirst of thousand tiny things 14 As one who long in populous city pent Wanders the summers breezes to inhale Among the pleasant farms &amp; dew plash'd bents I wander through the winding vale How sweet the smell of grain of tedded grass or kine How sweet the days o summer in his prime How sweet the hayfields with the shocks all clear Soft as a feather bed to sit or lie And short and green as bowling greens appear 15 While all above the beautiful clear sky Whose clouds beyond like marble mountains lie The new mown meadows by the running streams These beauteous rural objects I descry I love to see them when the low sun gleams To watch the evetide &amp; enjoy my summer dreams 16 Rich memory scenes are painted on the sky And other happy lands are passing in the clouds In oriental beauties charming the minds eye Eer even into night the Heaven shrouds Sometimes a city with unnumbered crowds Of kings and people in their majesty While mountains upon mountains sunny brow'd Climb to the very ceiling of the sky— 17 Travellers in sultry summer many a day Ive seen them journey through the sultry plain Greeting their friends they meet upon the way Then buzzing seek the mossy shade again Hurrying it seemeth from the threatning rain In humming notes of melody they sing Still bottle green or black their coat remains Fluttering from flower to flower on gauzy wing Loving like bird companions of the spring 18 How many a mile doth thy days journey lead While gathring honey over fell and tree Or hoarded from the flower besprinkled mead Gainst winters desolated hour of need When ice &amp; snow storms overspread the lea And ice locks up the water round the reed And nought but snows and nakedness we see What then becometh of the busy bee— 19 Slow sails the crow upon the summer wind The mist like smoke keeps thickening in the sky Sailing oer garden—field—a thing I mind Swarth, black or dun how easily they fly While underneath the waving meadows lie Looking luxuriant where the waters flow All wrinkled &amp; reflects the clouded sky The trees half leaving foliage do now show This way and that way sails the sooty crow 20 The wind curves round &amp; twirls &amp; puffs &amp; brays Boiling the wrinkled water like a fire The grass it quakes &amp; stirs a thousand ways Trees rolling billows we so much admire The grain swoops up in curves like to a spire Then the scene's changed—mists clear away behind The village steeple's seen with vane of fire Trees grass &amp; grain in merriest mind Toss leap, and frisk in summers merry wind 21 Tossing the hay in every sort of form Boats leaves &amp; lakes that suff the grass in waves The real appearance of a green grass storm In sparkling ripples &amp; in billowy graves Where numerous wild flowers in each eddy laves— And sphinx &amp; butterflies with painted wings In droves from flower to flower pass o'er the waves With honey bees &amp; other bright wing'd things That on the spear arm'd thistle cleans its wings 22 On broad leav'd sycamore is glaz'd the honey dew In the hot noon &amp; on the maple falls And oak in woods &amp; hedges—woodbines too Sticks on the fingers which the tongue recalls Sweet as the honey comb that seldom palls The taste—seeth'd in the sunshine and the dew Nectaranious sweet—I love the pleasant taste Of sweets dispens'd by nature good and true How wicked to destroy or rashly waste THE GREEN WOOD SIDE I wandered down a green wood side On Sunday noon in spring Where little birds their dwellings hide And Thrushes sweetly sing The moss so green round Hazel roots The Primrose by its side That in its brimstone livery shoots In bunches far and wide Oh there I met a pretty maid The fairest of her kind She stood beneath the Hazels shade Where lightly blew the wind I gave her cheek a hearty smack As leaning on her neck Her soft hair trailed adown her back Without a mark or Speck Within the dyke the bullrush grew Although the place was dry And Thrushes nest wi Eggs o' blue Did on the hedge ribs lye The Woodbines in green leaves look'd wan The Blue bell stooped i' pride And there I claspt my bonny Ann Along the greenwood side— Oh bonny Ann Oh bonny Ann What makes you look so fair Is it the love for some fond man Or is't for none you care My love to thee my bonny Ann Where primrose blooms wi' pride Ill talk and please thee all I can Down by the greenwood side— THE RAWK O' THE AUTUMN The rawk o' the Autumn hangs over the woodlands Like smoke from a City dismember'd and pale The sun without beams burns dim o'er the floodlands Where white Cawdymaws slow swiver and sail The flood froths away like a fathomless ocean The wind winnows chill like a breeze from the sea And thoughts of my Susan give the heart an emotion To think does she e'er waste a thought upon me Full oft I think so on the banks of the meadows While the pale Cawdymawdy flies swooping all day I think of our true love where grass &amp; flowers hid us As by the dyke side o' the meadows we lay The seasons have chang'd since I sat wi my true love Now the flood roars &amp; raves o'er the bed where we lay There the bees kiss'd the flowers—Has she got a new love I feel like a wreck of the flood cast away The rawk of the Autumn hangs over the woodland Like smoke from a City sulphurously grey The Heronshaw lonely hangs over the floodland And cranks its lone story throughout the dull day There's no green on the hedges no leaves on the darkwood No cows on the pasture or sheep on the lea The Linnets cheep still &amp; how happy the lark would Sing songs to sweet Susan to remind her of me THE SONGS OF OUR LAND The Songs of our land are they not worth reviving To sing o'er brown stout by the English fire side They are national links 'gainst deception contriving That spread over oceans &amp; lands far and wide They sing of our homes which great heroe's have bled for And the child o'er its horn book doth well understand That its birth's not a slavery which it learns to abhor Thro reading &amp; singing the songs of his land The Songs of the land sing of Englishmans freedom The songs of our land cheer the hearts that are true While they've voices to sing or fond hearts to read em And heroes to guard them in scarlet or blue The songs of our land are made for our comfort While on settles or chairs by our cottage fireside A fig for your priestcraft I'd give not a crumb for't A priest-ridden nation I ne'er could abide The Songs of our land are like ancient landmarks And curs'd be the traitor who takes one away Would man sell his birthright to literal land sharks And leave home &amp; friends to the stranger a prey We'll have nought o' the kind brave the nerves &amp; be steady The one in bright scarlet the other true blue Let the foe come &amp; welcome we're all waiting ready Rose, Thistle and Shamrock united are true THE SAILOR BOY Tis three years &amp; a quarter sin I left my own fireside To go aboard a ship through love &amp; plough the ocean wide I cross'd my native fields where the scarlet poppies grew And the ground lark left his nest like a neighbour which I knew The pigeons from the dove cote cooed over the old lane The crow flocks from the oakwood went flopping o'er the grain Like lots of dear old neighbours whom I shall see no more They greeted me that morning I left the English shore The sun was just a rising above the heath o' furze And the shadows grow to giants that bright ball never stirs There lay the shepherds with their dogs by their side And they started up and bark'd as my shadow they espied A maid o' early morning twirl'd her mop upon the moor I wished her my farewell before she closed the door My fields I left behind me for other places new Crows &amp; pigeons all were strangers as oer my head they flew Trees and bushes were all strangers the hedges &amp; the lanes The steeples &amp; the houses &amp; broad untrodden plains I pass'd the pretty milk maid wi' her red &amp; rosy face I know not where I met her I was strange to the place At last I saw the Ocean a pleasing sight to me I stood upon the shore of a mighty glorious sea The waves in easy motion went rolling on their way English colours were a flying where the British Squadron lay I left my honest parents the church clock &amp; the village I left the lads &amp; lasses the labour and the tillage To plough the briny ocean which soon became my joy I sat and sang among the shrouds a lonely sailor boy MY BETSEY DEAR My Betsey dear my early love Where shall I meet with thee By dark oak grove or willow grove Or by the Hawthorn tree My Ardent love to thee I'd prove Sacred it deeply burns within I swear by truth and light above None else my love shall win Can you be false to me Dear maid Can you be false to me Your cottage hid in willow trees I see the chimney smoke Nature brings all its charms to please And nothing to provoke I think I see your long dark hair As stooping o'er your flowers An houri you to me are there At morn &amp; evetide hours Then do you think of me Dear maid Say do you think of me? Love is not false it cannot be Let lies say what they will Twas Heaven to me to think of thee I'm thinking of thee still To see thy first averted looks It made me strange awhile While passing by meandering brooks With heaven in thy smile That smiling face of thine Dear maid That smiling face of thine My boyish fancy lov'd to hear The music from thy tongue Like to a fountain gushing clear They broke forth in a song I look'd down on the sparkling brook Up at the skies above And what I said to thy sweet look Was nothing but true love Yes love of purest mould Dear maid Love of the purest mould THE PROMISE You promised to meet me at e'en Beside the river bank so green You promised &amp; you've never been Or ever told me why The white thorn then was in the bud Now nuts have ripen'd in the wood Come love again Lost vows explain Your absence makes me sigh The white thorn gan to spread their leaves Im dis-appointed these two eves True love they say never deceives You should not promise wrong The corn had not began to shoot Now it is ripe and so is fruit And on this hill Fond love I will My visits still continue long The nuts are falling frae the lims I'm picking them like luve i' dreams How white &amp; flurried Ailsy seems To pass me on the way A bramble caught her Tartan gown Eer she the broken wall stept down And all her charms Were in my arms When I caught her on that day She blush'd as sweet Briar rose within Syne white as lilys all her skin The sweet briar blushes all went in And Ailsy sigh'd to say She'd been to service all the year 'Mong solemn folk on Island drear The Solway foam She cross'd frae home And left young Jamie far away Young Jamie gie[d] her nuts to crack And lap't his arm around her back And gave her cheek a hearty smack My Ailsy dear said he You've well explain'd your absence a And now on[e] payment stands for a Ill wed thee deary And bed thee deary Then thou and love my ain shall be WILL YE GANG MARY And will ye gang Mary and never more see me I' yer silks and yer satins and a' such fine gear When I told ye the truth ye would not bele'e me And truth wad na keep away a the lang year For shame o' thee Mary to be so deceiving The birds will [be] mocking o' a she pretends Love's only plain truth or its no use believing Love and Falsehood they ne'er cam together as friends There's muckle o' gale over love becomes mangled O sighs and o' tears sometimes faus as tis fair Tis not the frail thing on a dandys arm dangled That posesses one spark o' that blessing so rare As the dew o' the morning in dripples o' pearl As the velvet hued bloom of the sweet scented pea My heart's beating love for that innocent girl That wears both the name &amp; resemblance o thee There's nothing like to it so tender and fair In the dew o the morning or scent o' the flower In the joy or the gloom o its love or despair There's nought mistaen for it to this very hour And will ye gang mary &amp; never mair see me Then nature maun perish afore my love dee The wild rose bluims sweet in the hedges bele'e me When you see its bluim Mary think upon me SONG [The mist rauk is hanging] The mist rauk is hanging Over turnip fields green The wood gate is banging Where hunters are seen The brown leaves are dancing About on the green The horses are prancing Where the hounds hurry in Where Lucy stands knocking Her clogs at the gate Bright shoes &amp; white stocking Are killing of late Wi cotton or silk on What man could forbear Where Lucy sits milking To kiss if he dare The Maples turn yellow Hazels crimson &amp; brown Oaks still keep their colour Popples fade &amp; fall down When a milking goes Lucy Where woodbramble weaves T[he] winds wont excuse ye But pelts her wi leaves On her new gown and bonnet They patter and fall Leaving no stain upon it They pat and thats all Crows quawk &amp; swoop over Like chimney sweep crows Lucy milks under cover Nor sullies her clothes Home rambles young Lucy With her milk buckets twain Oer grass fields were dews be And rut brimming lane She sings songs till sunday When she offers her vows And in drab frock on monday Goes milking the cows LOVELY ELLEN Happy Ellen near thy dwelling True love wanders night and day Nothing fearing ever hearing What my charmer has to say Can I please thee do I tease thee Happy Ellen prythee say Near thy dwelling Haughty Ellen Fancy wanders every day At the windows like a cinder Burning with too hot desire I am speaking true love seeking To quench the flame and damp the fire Lovely Ellen near thy dwelling I love sick wander night and day On thy bosom grief dispeling Every sorrow fades away I'LL GANG AND SEE PHEMIE I'll gang and see Phemie she's fair and she's asy She's as trim as new pins &amp; as bright as a daisy Her love's born to charm &amp; never to fraze ye So I'll gang and see Phemie the Irishmans joy Och! her gown is the slate color Paddy my dear I'll love her my honey through all the long year Its with her my fancy I jist like to employ And I'll set myself down as her tight Irish boy So I laid down my hoe by the side o the praters The sun had gone down in the best o' good natures In the fold lay the sheep purty innocent craturs And Phemie's the same to an Irishmans eye I got to her cabin—Say's I, Phemie my dear I'm that same that is standing a waiting here Come in says she Paddy and dont look so quere In I went I belave ye a light Irish boy— Sure Phemie says I, I'm in love wi the name o' ye If I be'nt its loves truth they're all crying shame o' ye I'm come to make love to ye, now don't make game o' me Ye been my own blood &amp; skin the whole of the year Arrah Paddy says Phemie ye's are surely a dreaming Why don't ye sit as'y its bothered yer seeming The same as when Donny brook races yer leaving When you gave me an orange Paddy my dear So make yerself asy my young bothered starling Youre seated &amp; welcome if Phemie's yer darling So I gave her a kiss wi'out snicking or snarling And fondly I took to my arms my own dear I said my dear Phemie better see the Priest sent for The truth o' that same was all that I went for And the Priest wi his book leaves me nought to repent for Her names on my heart &amp; I'll keep it here— COME IN THE MORNING Come in the morning the sunrises clear The dew's on the cowslip the thorn &amp; the brere Come at the noon in the suns hottest glow The elm's throw dark shadows wherever they grow Come in the even when the suns left the skies And the bloom o' the sweet brere holds Pearls i' their eyes Come at all times and seasons you surely will be Always welcome &amp; more when you come to see me I went at the Even the Heaven was slate grey And the wild blossom's blooming bedeck'd the road way Horse shoe leav'd mallows wi plush satin flowers All covered wi blossoms blush'd up to the doors The green linnets nest o' moss drift and wool Was snug in the white thorn stretching over the pool Hen's ruffled their feathers &amp; to their roosts flew And the gate stood half open to let me through She met me &amp; smiled from the open door too Our kisses both met as we said ‘How d'ye do’ And when I got in I kissed her again While the pert province roses peep'd in at the pane I sat there &amp; courted neath a sky full o' stars And she sat beside me like Venus and Mars I was evermore welcome whenever I went When the moonlight it glinted upon grass or bent I went—I was welcome whenever I went When the daiseys turn'd buttons—dew beaded the bent At morning or evening whenever I came Her kisses were sweet How I worship her name At the noon when the Elm shadows darkened her door I took hasty kisses more sweet than before Nor care I what trouble or care I may see Since Mary Susannah thinks upon me— OH WHAT SO SWEET AS LOVE How much of time the lover throws away How many useless journeys will he stray To win the object of his hearts desires When the moon rises and the sun retires When purple pea blooms glisten in nights dew The lovers walk with maidens that are true The silvery moon the while on white thorns shine As fond and faithfully I went with mine In moonlit shadows we with one consent Down the footpath by the greenwoodside went The nightingale poured all its music out And the Owl hooted as he swooped about The gate swung gently as she stept across The old stone tunnel—where the snorting horse Made her heart startle into fears surprise While moonbeams fast asleep on greensward lies Oh! what so sweet! or beautiful as love Whispered by moonlight by woodside or grove Where the beams asleep lie on the grass Hears not the whispers of my blooming lass Nor notes one kiss in quiet evetide given On loves young cheek beneath the light of Heaven Our vows in kisses breathe from hearts in tune Oh sweet are kisses neath the pale round moon The long dark shadows seem like lurking elves And though we whisper know all like ourselves How beautiful the pale round moon appears Through her black hair peepeth the maids white ears Just as white lilys thr[o]ugh dark ground looks through On lovers secrets in the moonlight dew I kisst her lips drove all her tears away Till truth grew dumb and love no more could say AN ANECDOTE OF LOVE When April &amp; dew brings primroses here I think love of you at the Spring o' the year Did I harbour bad words when your garter fell off I to stoop was deterred but I stood not to scoff A bitt of brown list of small value must be But as it lay there 'twas a diamond to me Ere back you turned to pick it up I noticed well the place For children there for violets stoop With many a rosey face I fain would stoop myself you see But dare not well presume The Blackbird sung out let it be The maid was in her bloom How beautiful that ancle was From which that garter fell And lusty was the bonny lass Whose name I dare not tell I know the colour of her gown Her bonnet Ribbon too The fairest maiden in the town Is she that wears the blue Though years have gone but when I see The green spot where it fell The stitchwort flower delighteth me There blooming in the dell And years may come no winter seers The green haunts of the Dove Those wild flowers stand the bl[i]ght of years Sweet anecdotes of love— FARE THEE WELL Fare thee well till next we meet The winters snows and sleet Has chilled our summers heat Fare thee well There bloom'd the small heath bell My dear one loved so well And the heather too as well In the dell The woodbine round white thorn Smelt sweet at early morn Where little birds were born In the nest By the scented thymy hill Where the wheat ear wipes her bill We sat and loved our fill Truly blest Though winter warps the ground As if twas iron bound Pleasant days shall yet be found When flowers appear She'll again come to renew Her love promises so true By the pretty heath bell blue Growing near Oh tis a pleasant place When the wild rose shews its face And the Ivy trails embrace Gnarled oak trees We'll meet where we've oft met For the winters on the fret And the Primrose closed as yet Does appear [Language has not the power to speak what love indites] Language has not the power to speak what love indites The soul lies buried in the Ink that writes THE MAID I LOVE The maid I love is fair as driven snow Her raven curls around her white neck flow Like light from the darkness comes above Is the beautiful girl that I love— The maid I love is like the wild hedge rose That by woodside in the hedge row blows Her lily hand is hidden in a glove Soft are the features of the maid I love An heart hidden thought it seems to me A womans worth is there in a maids simplicity Hope glances on her eyelids from above Oh sweet is the presence of the maid I love— As roses in the green bud lie concealed In the summers sunny breath are revealed So in hidden thought that fair one I approve Who will waken up my heart to her love— ROSES Go rose my Chloe's bosom grace How happy should I prove Could I supply that envied place With ever fading love Accept dear Maid now summer glows This pure unsullied gem Loves Emblem in a full blown rose Just broken from the stem Accept it tis a favoured flower For thy soft breast to wear Twill blossom there its transient hour A favourite of the fair— Upon thy cheek its blossom glows As from a mirror clear Making thyself a living rose In blossom all the year It is a sweet and favorite flower To grace a maidens brow Emblem of Love without its power A sweeter rose art thou The rose like hues of insects wing May perish in an hour Tis but at best a fading thing But thou'rt a living flower— The roses steep'd in morning dews Holds every eye in thrall But woman she alone subdues Her beauty conquers all I WISH I WAS A LITTLE BIRD I wish I was a little bird To sing in my loves ear The dearest tale that e'er was heard Mary Boyfield she should hear I love'd her in [my] early days And I love her dearly still From all she meets with willing praise And no one means her ill— I wish I was a little bird To whistle in her ear A song by nature never heard As tender as tis dear To wake the soul up in her eyes The love within her breast And all those happy extacies Where love with her doth rest— Could I with Mary Boyfield be A singing little bird I'd sing her songs of mirth and glee As love has never heard I'd kiss the moles upon her breast The roses on her cheeks And that should be my place of rest For hours and days aye weeks The violets o the hedge and grove The brere hedge roses grace But sweet is Mary Boyfields love Tis blushing in her face Oh! could I all my secret tell Could I that maid caress The maiden I do love so well Id all my love confess— There's nothing in the world so sweet There's nought so fair to see So choice so lovely and complete As my Mary is to me Oh! would I were the little bird That sings in yonder grove I'd sing the song that neer was heard O' bonny Mary's love— DO YE LIKE THE HEATH LASSIE Do ye like the heath lassie There to hear the wild bee The Ring fingers brassey The Blue skipper free Up and down dancing Out oer the lea In the sun glancing Then wander with me Take up your bonnet love On with your shawl love The walk depend on it love Is pleasant for all love Do ye like the hills maiden Oer laden with thyme With rock roses braiden Shining bright and divine Do ye like the furze prickly Yellow over with flower And crimpt brake looking sickly In the sunsetting hour The heather heath maiden Do you like it or no Then put on your plaiden And off we will go— There the spinning bee fly At the Foxglove hath spun Then darts from the eye Like a shot from a gun Do ye like the heath maiden Its mole hills o' thyme With the rock roses braiden Then up let us climb Thy bonnet put on love And fold on thy shawl From its rest the Doves gone love Light shines over all Dost thou love the heath maiden Furze bush, flower and tree And the rock roses braiden The hills follow me MY BEAUTIFUL NANNY Oh Nanny your face wears the hue of the morning There's nothing so bonny as you dearest Nanny Your hair like the clouds oer the sunshine adorning Your face is the fullest of beauty of any My own pretty Nanny my beautiful Nanny Oh give me one more o' those beautiful smiles I'll face the worlds scorn the proudest of many For no kind o' ambition sweet Nanny beguiles A face she has got such the Queen might be proud on Yet Nanny heeds nothing o' praises she hears The pebble paved brook the clear water raves loud on Is not half so sweet as my Nanny appears Her lips red as cherries her eyes bright as pearl Her neck's like the lily her hair raven black My Nanny's the fairest sweet beautiful girl As straight as a Fir dale Hips, shoulder and back Sweet Nanny my beautiful Nanny come here How green grows the meadow how shady the tree The brook underneath it runs beautiful clear Round Nanny's black gown how delighted the bee Oh Nanny's bright eyes dearly love the wild flowers The level green meadow the dark spreading tree How happy I'd feel in these green sunny hours If my Nanny vouch[s]afes to smile kindly on me COME HITHER ISABEL The sun is shining on the leaves Of many a pleasant place And sweet the healthy morning breathes Upon the maidens face The wild hedge roses down the lane Lends to the Peach its hue The lovers heart it sets on flame They are beautiful and true Come in the fields sweet Isabel My Isabella come Beneath the Beech loves tale I'll tell This bank shall be her home The wind shall wake its song for thee The sweet aeolian wind That sets the leaves in dancing glee And leaves rich health behind— Those scenes my Isabella loves The water and the plain And the old oak trees spreading groves The sweetest place to name So come my Isabella here Enjoy the health of morn The leaves so green the water clear Sweet is the rustling corn The mansion leave my Isabell And walk the fields with me Come where delight is sure to dwell Where nature reigneth free As shepherd girl in gown of green Come hither love and dwell The morning sky the oaks dark green Come hither Isabel WOMAN HAD WE NEVER MET Woman had we never met I nor thou had felt regret Never had a cause to sigh Never had a wish to die To part and cease to love thee Had I shared the smallest part Of friendship from a womans heart Never had I felt the pains Of these ever galling chains Or ever ceased to love thee And never on my burning brow Felt the cain curses I do now That withers up the anxious brain Blighting what never blooms again When woman ceased to love me The Spring may come the sun may shine The earth may send forth sweets divine What pain I've felt have still to know The nought in Nature e'er to show Since woman ceased to love me Woman had we never met Love had witnessed no regret Never left us cause to sigh Or me a vainer wish to die To part and cease to love thee WRITTEN IN PRISON I envy e'en the fly its gleams of joy In the green woods from being but a boy Among the vulgar and the lowly bred I envied e'en the hare her grassy bed Innured to strife and hardship from a child I traced with lonely step the desert wild Sigh'd o'er bird pleasures but no nest destroyed With pleasure felt the singing they enjoyed Saw nature smile on all and shed no tears A slave through ages though a child in years The mockery and scorn of those more old An Esop in the worlds extended fold The fly I envy settling in the sun On the green leaf and wish my goal was won SONNET [I love to see the summer beaming forth] I love to see the summer beaming forth And white wool rock clouds sailing to the north I love to see the wild flowers come again And Mare blobs stain with gold the meadow drain And water lilies whiten on the flood Where reed clumps rustle like a wind shook wood Where from her hiding place the Moor Hen pushes And seeks her flag nest floating in bull rushes I like the willow leaning half way o'er The clear deep lake to stand upon its shore I love the hay grass when the flower head swings To summer winds and insects happy wings That sport about the meadow the bright day And see bright beetles in the clear lake play THE MAPLE TREE The Maple with its tassell flowers of green That turns to red a stag horn shaped seed Just spreading out its scallopped leaves is seen Of yellowish hue yet beautifully green Bark ribb'd like corderoy in seamy screed That farther up the stem is smoother seen Where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers Up each spread stoven to the branches towers And mossy round the stoven spread dark green And blotched leaved orchis and the blue bell flowers Thickly they grow and neath the leaves are seen I love to see them gemm'd with morning hours I love the lone green places where they be And the sweet clothing of the Maple tree MY AIN HEART LOVE IS THINE My ain heart love is thine If I'd the mair to spare Love thoughts are pure as heaven divine They're Truth and naething mair And thine is truth or has been sae Till parting made us twain The spring that makes the grasses grow Will sure come green again Thy voice will come a shorter way Than e'er it did of yore For we've been married many a day And coyness now is o'er Ive wiped the gold dust frae thy shoe As we clomb the King Cup hill And brush'd thy new gown often too And I felt no kind of ill— To see and only just to see Those bubbies shaking oer Your stays as white as curds they be Till I dare look no more When I come by your pleasant town I'll whisper what loves hid sae long And walk the knob weed pasture brown And kiss thee as we walk along— And will it be at Christmas time Or will it be at Spring In winter or when flowers are prime Love is a pleasing thing The pasture seats are made for rest We'll sit at eventide And then I'll kiss thy snowy breast And nestle by thy side And think upon love days gone by How beautiful they past Yet nothing shines in loves bright sky Sae lovely as the last To kiss and say farewell and then To kiss sae loathe to part Then say fare well agen—and then Stay on till forced to start And when were auld and past the waurk We'll may be scant o grace But gie wa to the younger foulk And let em take our place To teach them best the means o grace Teach truth and naething mair We'll let the childer tak our place And yoke the kind afore THE SHEPHERDS DAUGHTER How sweet is every length'ning day And every change of weather When summer comes on skies blue grey And brings her hosts together Her flocks of birds her crowds of flowers Her sunny shining water I dearly love the woodbine bowers That hides the Shepherds daughter In gown o' green or brown or blue The shepherds daughter leal and true How bonny is her lily breast How sweet her rosey face She'd gie my aching bosom rest Where love would find its place While earth is green and skies are blue And sunshine gilds

hinney As from her eyes they fell Sir I've been to ask my minny And her answers like my sel Her frock it caught a bramble And I took the thorn away On the heath we both did ramble Till the gouden west

Why dinna Johnny nearer come That we may sooner meet thegether COME SIT WI THE BIRDIES Come sit wi the birdies thou bonny young maiden The goud spink and Blackbird &amp; don't be affraid They sing where the Hawthorn the waterfall shading Hangs over the gulf in May blossoms arrayed In her Bridal white dress extending her arms As if to embrace other bushes &amp; may Come love to green places in meadows &amp; farms And like the white thorn be thy love all the day Where the yellow flag down by the meadow pool stood And the pink ragged robin dips down to the flood How sweet bluims the paigle the gowan &amp; primrose Baith yellow and blue by the side o the burn And under the gouden broom clearly the brook flows You can just see the siller light now when it turns I court thee my love in the language of truth Awhile in the forest love let us sojourn For loving and fond is the bosom of Ruth Sae come and we'll wander away to the burn And hear the Muir cock gie its heart stirring ca Where the hay scented Thistle bluims bonny and bra We will mark the clear water that smooth[e]s the chaf'd pebble And sit on the breckan bank crispy and green Till it gets to a sand heap and scarcely can dribble Washed up by the flood in the valleys so green And there we'll both gang till the closing o' eve And saftly I'll press the fond bosom of Ruth While the Butterfly flutters to sit on her sleeve I'll sit down and tell her a story of truth We'll look oer a landscape as Eden divine And I'll kiss and believe that Ruth she is mine ALONG THE WILLOW BANKS OF NEN Along the willow banks of Nen Where bows the bullrush tall I wander from the ways of men And get released from thrall Winds rustling in the flags &amp; sedge That pucker o'er the stream In ruffles to the waters edge How beautiful they seem Cool and refreshing is the flood It does the weary spirits good There's nought so sweet as summer winds Their soft and perfumed wings That every wild flowers dwelling finds And to their blossom clings Theres nothing half so soft or sweet It helps the busy bee Trees, bushes, dance where'er they meet Its rural minstrelsy They bend and bow and then are still As summer winds their mins[t]rels will How beautiful the river glides And wanders at its will What plashing ripples wash its tides And crinkle further still How beautiful the gurgling noise The shingly pebbles make The fish leap up as many boys Are playing ‘Duck and Drake’ Fish leap in rings and rush and sedge Conveys them to the waters edge Here could I but my Hannah see The winds play in her Auburn hair On the green bank beside o' me Her red rose Cheek so plump and fair How beautiful the place would be How brighter far the flowing stream Millions of suns in spangles flee Tis doubly happy so to dream And this green place secure from ill Makes Hannahs memory dearer still THE CHIMING BELLS How peaceful sound the chiming bells From yonder lonely tower That o'er the cornfield valley swells And beanfields all in flower Calmly they reach the shepherds ear As he oer upland climbs No day to him is half so dear As sunday with its chimes The beanfields make the air so sweet In pink and purple plea How beautiful the lake we meet And the willow weeping tree Decayed by time a very shell And bent as tumbling in The pit so deep we cannot tell Much deeper than the chin How beautiful the sunday looks To any other day How green the fields how clear the brooks Beneath the white thorn may How beautiful from yon old tower The chimes their story tells Theres little in the summer hour So sweet as chiming bells— Come dear Amanda walk with me Let us enjoy the prime Of field and meadow scenery And hear the sabbath chime We'll walk beneath the willow row Where screaming plover dwells And with the winding river go And hear the Sabbath bells AN ANGEL IN THE SUMMER HOURS In the bloom of June arrayed When the grass is fit to mow Barley spindling in the blade And the turnips on the grow Beside the meadow bank I lay gazing at the sky The cows stared round &amp; drank When a maiden passed me by In hat of straw &amp; ribbons gay Her face like roses all the way The thistle flowers with prickles burred The blue caps in the corn so blue Hot headaches like a fire new stirred Nigh burnt the lookers through So burnt her cheek aneath the sun Her dark brown hair was hung in curls She stood where meadow waters run And deeply rolled with frothy swirls Through flag clumps full o yellow flowers An angel in the summer hours— I said some words and she replied And pauzeing tied her hat anew Red hot grew poppies by her side And blue caps most divinely blue I would have kiss'd her on the cheek Her dimsey waist I long'd to span But purling like a silver streak Between us both the waters ran A lone and undivided lot Soft words and looks were all I got I saw her in the meadow lake In every flower the maid appear'd The lark seem'd singing for her sake And every bloom the maid endeared In fancy's ear she spoke as plain And soft and lovely as before My eyes looked after her in vain And saw the meadow as before Yet till the mirk eve lowered the sky Her spirit seem'd as lingering nigh HERES A HEALTH TO SCOTLAND Heres a health to bonny Scotland and the land o the west Heres a health to bonny Scotland as the land I loo the best I've a love for the mountain and the freedom o the flood And the bonny sight o Highland hills it does my spirits good Heres a love for bonny lasses and a health for honest men The dwellers on the mountains and the tenants o' the glen I've drank old Scotlands health and I mean to do it still And my own hearts bluid for liberty is left upon yon hill— Where the boldest men have conquered and freedom truly won Upon the Scottish mountains beneath a glorious sun I've done it ance or twice for that highly favored land And I'll do it ance agen wi my claymore in my hand And charge wi all her chivalry the flower o Highlan men And the bonnet and the Thistle shall cross the Tweed agen Shall cross the Tweed for liberty and leave the English free For her union is the roses &amp; I'll never spoil the tree So here's a health to Scotland o' the whiskey gill And may her claymore ne'er be drawn for honest body's ill When the bayonets on the musket and the claymore from the sheath Let each stroke be for Liberty for guilty tyrants death His bluid shall stain the heather who our Scottish right defames And Bannockburn is living still that tyrant felon shames So here's a health to Scotland the freest of the free Her ain laws are the bible which speaks of Liberty PRETTY KATE KEARNEY Kate Kearney is bonny the queen o' ould Erin The gem o' the emerald Island so green By the lake o Killarney the morn sun appearing Is nothing more bright than the bonny young queen She blooms like the morning The mountains adorning Sweet Kittys the gem o the mountain so green Oh Kitty's as fair as the rose wet wi e'ening And sweet as the apple just pulled from the tree While her beautiful head on her white hand is leaning She's just the choice Angel to bother poor me Her eyes diamond lustres Her dark curls in clusters Went nigh to the death and the finish o' me I sat down and sigh'd by the lake o Killarney When bonny Kate pass'd wi such life in her face She turn'd round and laugh'd and called it a blarney That a man should be sitting alane in that place Sae I ventured to meet her In love words to greet her And sweet were the smiles that she left in my face I went on beside her the pretty Kate Kearney And call'd her my hinney my darlint &amp; dear She says my young man are you bent on a journey I muttered excuses and look'd rather queer As she went on smiling And look'd so beguiling I spake bold and won her when no one was near MARY HELEN FROM THE HILL The flaggy wheat is in the ear At the low end of the town And the barley horns begin to spear Frae the spindle through the crown The black snail he has crept abroad In dangers ways to run And midges oer the road Are dancing in the sun Where firdales darkest shadows leave Sweet Mary Hellen walks at eve In the deep dyke grows the reed The bullrush wabbles deeper still And oval leaves of water weed The dangerous deeper places fill The river winds and feels no ill How lovely sinks the setting sun The fish leaps up with trembling trill Grasshoppers chirrup on the reed The mead so green the air so still Evening assembles sweet indeed With Mary Hellen from the Hill Who wanders by that rivers brim In dewy flowers and shadows dim Right merrily the midges dance Above the river stream Their wings like silver atoms glance In evenings golden beam The boat track by the rivers side Where Mary Hellen roves The cloud sky where the river wide The banks of willow groves And Mary Hellen in young pride Rambling by the river side— THE DEPARTED And art thou doomed as one of those To pass away and be forgot So sweet as oped that summer rose So green as seem'd that happy spot Where thou wast fairest of the fair And dearer than ought else beside Though much of sweetness blossom'd there And thou too—to be cast aside The lady of that splendid home Is it no more thy place to be Can strangers have the face to come To ape the original of thee The very flowers they know thy face The birdies they all know thy voice The trees put on their summer grace And lawns grow velvet at thy choice To think that some few days ago This bloom of thought this flower of show Should fade and disappear away To senseless earth and noisome clay Where all was life and gaiety Now loathsome to the meanest eye Hid in the dark and vaulted tomb Where grass can't grow or flowers bloom Those eyes of fire that kept awake The lovers heart to bear &amp; break Are gone out dark in that lone cell No more on earth in light to dwell Death sighs that left that budding breast Where Heavens own light her bosom blest Like as a light cloud hides the sun Her eyes closed when the worst was done Friends might gaze and wonder why That body could so silent lye She lays so like the life in sleep Her nearest kin could hardly weep That blessed spirit's has taken its flight To the celestial source of light A full blown rose pluck'd in its bloom To fade and die in the silent tomb LOST AS STRANGERS AS WE PASS The summer rose in loves own hue Blushes and blooms so fair and free I gaze on the[e] with looks as true Thou look'st on me and vacancy Can'st thou look here and all forget The place the time is nothing there Then pity man whose so beset And woman e'er was made so fair Thy swelling breast is just the same As when we met and lov'd so true The Evening sun went down in flame And shed her shower of pearly dew My arm was o'er thy shoulders thrown Thy gentle hand was held in mine And now I pass to thee unknown Thy eye that brightens only mine I guess and know and own it not We're lost as strangers and we pass Though there's green places unforgot Where love would clasp my bonny lass Aye clasp her in the fondest arms And hold her like a lump of love The same flowers grow in fields and farms The same blue sky is arched above JOHN THE CARPENTER I know him not my mither dear Youre always in his way But when you're gone he's always here Aye thretty times a day He's always asking ‘Whats o Clock?’ And what we aynt to lend Hes some strange loon a come to mock If not my mothers friend Guess not so rude uncouthly chield He's maybe led astray Wi thy white bosom let me feel't If that will aught betray She saw her wark was slowly done No thread spun frae the rock She own'd blood red the tell tale sun Saw kisses near the clock And when he kissed me aince mither He wanted line and rule And ask'd when kissing twice mither What bairns I put to school He gave me just half minute time For thretty kisses more I lov'd him mother for that crime And saw him to the door While roses wear anither hue White lilies tell the truth What makes ye turn sae pale my sue About this stranger youth What makes me turn sae pale mither Cause truth I dare no tell Although you cross my breast mither I maun keep that mysell You ca him John the carpenter And so think ither foulk What that Priest doth at church aver I[s] something past a

gipsey the sweet Susan Grey [The daisey is tipped wi the dew] The daisey is tipped wi the dew The king cup is blistered wi rain The sun scorches yellow right through And the white spots shew still like a stain The grass it lies green on the bank And the moss greener still on the thorn And the primrose all brimstone and dank They all the wood hedges adorn BORN UPON AN ANGELS BREAST I crime and emnity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die Who say to us in slanders breath That love belongs to sin and death From Heaven it came on Angels wing To bloom on earth eternal spring In falsehoods enmity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die Twas born upon an angels breast The softest dreams the sweetest rest The brightest sun the bluest sky Are loves own home and canopy The thought that cheers this heart of mine Is that of Love—Love so divine They sin who say in slanders breath That love belongs to Sin and death The sweetest voice that lips contain The sweetest thought that leaves the brain The sweetest feelings of the heart Theres pleasure even in its smart The scent of Rose and Cinnamon Is hot like Love remem[b]ered on In falsehoods enmity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die SONG OF LOVE TO JEANNIE The Simmer time in simmers prime And the sweet meadow grasses How sweet the swathes the pretty paths Where throng the bonny lasses The tawny bee hums oer the lea There seeking for the hinney Bright speckled thrush in white thorn bush Sings sangs of Love to Jeannie For Jeannies rare and Jeannies fair And handsome as she's bonny And gay she walks and sweet she talks The fairest maid o' ony Bullrushes quiver down the river A sort o' glassy Ocean A glittering light gems each stem bright Of the rushes all in motion The simmer scene the meadow green Are beautiful in feature And green are flowers in simmer hours How sweet the charms o' nature A simmers walk a womans talk Is sweet as wild bees hinney Oer meadow leas how sweet to be A walking with my Jeannie Hay cocks in heaps the fish he leaps Aboon the meadow streams Oer flood and grass like spangled glass The Suns reflexion gleams Green hedge &amp; trees cornfields and leas Are worth the sight o' seeing The wild rose hues mid evening dews Charm every human being The clouds pearl white each rural sight How sweet they all appear Cows feeding round each rural sound Is music to the ear And meadow field what joy they yield Where twittering sunbeams glimmer Earth, air and sky hath health &amp; joy My Jeannie loves the simmer ‘Jane Wilson’ BONNY LASSIE DINNA LEAVE ME Bonny Lassie dinna leave me Losing thee would ever grieve me If it be a sin to love thee Why's the sun so bright above thee Why's the sky so heavenly blue My Jinney when I'm courting you And when you go so dull's the scene The simmer seems to lose its green All wears the mist and mountain hue When Jinneys gone there's naught to woo Nature puts on its mourning gown And grass &amp; leaves look black &amp; brown There's nothing lovely nothing sweet Sin I wi Jinney failed to meet The lark is silent all the day Where can the handsome vagrant stray Where can she hide so sweet a face Which brightens up this silent place The brook rins over pebbled stones And Jinneys voice is in its tones Bonnie lassie leave me never If thou'rt mine I'm thine for ever Thou'rt like a flower my bonny Jennie Nature brings thee stores o' hinney Bluiming sweet at evenings hour The fairest first dew dropping flower Wild woodbines covered oer wi hinney Are naething nigh so sweet as Jinney Her I'll love and leave her never If sin is love I'll love for ever FLOW ON WINDING RIVER Flow on winding river in silence for ever The sedge &amp; flags rustle about in a bustle You are dear to my fancy thou smooth flowing river The bullrush bows calm and theres peace in the hustle As the boat gently glides Oer thy soft flowing tides As the young maidens sail on a sweet summer day The wavelets in ridges by osiers through bridges Neath the grey willows shade &amp; the nestling reeds made Were dear to my fancy as onward they sail The osiers they dip in the rings lilys made And the maiden look'd red As the corn poppy bed Or dog rose that blushed in the shade The day was delightful where but gadflies where spiteful The hum of the Bee carolled merrily there The Butterflies danced round the wild flowers delightful And the old willows toss'd their grey locks in the air The boat softly rippled Suspended oars drippled While the maidens were lovely &amp; beauteously fair The boat gently pushes aside the bullrushes All gilt by the water &amp; summer sunbeams How soft the oar dashes the stream as it splashes By the side of the boat wi its burden o dreams The rushing of waters The songs o' earths daughters How sweetly they sound in the plash of the streams OH SUSAN MY DEAREST Sweet is the Brompton Stocks perfume at eve And sweet is the bloom o' the Pink and white Pea And odours delicious the hedge roses weave The woodbines they're sweeter than Jessamines be But none o' these wild blossoms blooming in dew Can wi the sweet looks of Susey compare Her cheeks are so sweet &amp; her heart is so true And soft brown &amp; sunny

What beauties the summer discloses How sweet are the banks o' the Nen How lusciously sweet the dog roses Hang over the old Otters den The fish they leap up in the stream The flags they look green by its side The flowers up and down like a dream And the insects are glancing wi pride The birds are all out in the sun And they build in the flags o the stream From the reeds how the water rats run While sun rays on wave ridges gleam Come hither my Hellen Maria The Meadow pink blossoms for thee The top of the rivers on fire How green is the bush and the tree The hemlocks and keksies and Rue Grow

wi their mole eyed faces In Briery borders and wood mossy places I love pale primroses well And the wild Blue bell Primroses I love in the Briery dell I love it for the sake of young school boys A school boy once myself I shared their joys Teasing through thorns On Aprils dewy morns I love to hear in woods the young school boys They scramble for Primrose and Violet And handfuls mid oak leaves they get They spy in hedge row prest With eggs a Black birds nest They take out the eggs and the poor birds fret Ye curdled leaves in summers shiny hours Clustering round the sulphur colored flowers The Primroses brings All loveliest things The meadow is beaded wi dews by spring showers [The yellow leaves are falling round the bushes every one] The yellow leaves are falling round the bushes every one And the song broods of thrushes with summer time is gone The daisey in the rushes till cold blast comes lives on WE STOOD BENEATH THE HAZEL SHADE We stood beneath the hazel shade Her arms lapp'd in her apron white And lovely look'd the peerless maid Amid the lingering light I would have clasped she hied away I talked of Woman and of love She heard all that I had to say Her silence perhaps my love approve We stood the last night all away How full of Stars the sky No further would the maiden stray Nor with loves suit comply The night came on &amp; hid all round The moonlight scarcely shone I round her neck my fond arm wound For we were both alone She silently excused my talk I looked on her blue eye Down by the woodside she'd not walk I could do nought but sigh She would not leave the hazel place The moon did dimly shine I love to look upon that face And would that it were mine THY BONNY SMILE Thy bonny smile thy inky hair Parted before and forehead bare Have every power to please me Thy lily skin without a speck Thy bonny waist and slender neck Thy gown that does thy person deck Makes all my troubles easy I fields o green in meadows gay Me and my love will often stray Where she doth often please me Where wild weeds turn to pleasant flowers I'll walk with her neath white thorn bowers And there we'll talk in summer hours Kisses of love will ease me There will we walk my bonny girl While showers bead the flowers wi pearl Thy raven locks shall please me Rain must not soil thy glossy shoe A bare dry place we'll find to woo Nor fear the rain or evening dew While thy fond love shall ease me LASSIE I LOVE THEE Lassie I love thee The heavens above thee Look downwards to move thee And prove my love true My arms round thy waist love My head on thy breast love By a true man cares[s]t love Ne'er bid me adieu Thy cheeks full o' blushes Like the rose in the bushes In a love stream it gushes With over delight Though clouds may come o'er thee Sweet maid I'll adore thee As I do now before thee I Love thee outright It stings me to madness To see thee all gladness While I'm full o sadness Thy meaning to guess Thy gown is deep blue love In honour of true love Ever thinking of you love My love I'll confess My love ever shewing Thy hearts worth the knowing It is like the sun glowing And hid in thy breast Thy lover behold me To my bosom I'll fold thee For thou love thou'st just told me So here thou may rest MY MINNIE TOLD ALL My Minnie told all to my Daddie at e'en And my lover was by both denied Sae I made him a bed in fields in their green And laid my sen close by his side The wind it blew brisk and shook all the leaves Which covered us both as we lay For honest true love it never deceives Here Minnie &amp; Daddie has nothing to say The Linnet sang oer us a pleasant gay tune As ever I heard him before While there we lay down by the light of the moon And he kiss'd me quite home to the door My Minnie said nay &amp; my Daddie forbade But they could do naething with him A whisper by dark is not lost in the shade And to kiss one we love is no sin The peas are in blossom &amp; sweet the beans smell And the grass where we sat wavered green And love in that place not a secret will tell Where we were not listened to or seen My Minnie said nay and my Daddie forbade But forbidden my Lover wont be We meet there at e'en when he's put by the spade And will while a leaf's on the tree MY LOVE IS FAIR My loving dear is very fair As she walks at morning early When bean blooms scent the morning air She walks across the barley The misty dew spread oer the glade In sunshine glittered gailey As forth afield mid sun &amp; shade I went with Betsey Bailey Her gown was pink her stocking white Her face was plump and roundy To look within her eye so bright Would utterly confound ye They'd make you shrink beneath their light Till words were spoke to quail ye And then you'd sigh from morn till night For handsome Betsey Bailey My love is fair my love is sweet As red pink or carnation And if she speaks not when we meet Its nought but botheration The waters wrinkle in the wind The meadows bloom so gaily And I am troubled in my mind For absent Betsey Bailey THERE'S LOVE IN HER SILENT LOOKS With coal black hair and rose red face And skin as white as milk My sweetheart keeps a servants place And wears a gown o' silk I've loved the bonny maid for years And love her person still Birds sing my fondness in her ears Of me she thinks no ill Her beauty blossoms like summers hour Her face resembles springs fair flower Her face is fair her hair is black I love the gown upon her back My heart in melody does ring Her praises I will ever sing Her smile is dearer than the flower That bloometh in its transient hour There is love in her silent looks There is love in the touch of her hand Her eye sparkles bright as the brooks Her face is the best in the land That neck and that face and that cheek My love ever yearneth to kiss I that oppunity fainly would seek I'm mad when I'm thinking on this Her eyes so bright her face so fair Her rose red cheek her coal black hair I love the maid full true and well And ever on her virtues dwell My dear Mary I but seldom see Her brown silk gown it looks so sweet Her cotton drab garments give to me I love her when passing down the street I long to call Mary my own And clasp round her shoulders broad And to be with her when alone Down the pleasant greenwood sward And breathe in her delicate ear My whisper of love and of fear THE SILVER MOON THAT LIGHTS THE WAY The sun takes delight to shine on her gown And the wind ever sought to be fanning her face It blew the old hovel in the home close quite down Because she was milking her cows in the place The dog rose was proud of her thorns and her flowers The bonniest bush within the green space But the roses turned pale in the bowers When she shewed them her own pretty face The silver moon that lights the way Is now disclosing its bright face Lights up the stars with her holy ray And peeps into every green place The stars are twinkling in the blue And proudly they delight To see the maiden brush the dew As she walks in their silent light In silver beads the grasses lie They gently brush her feet The daisy would have oped its eye If it chanced her smile to meet The pilewort would have shewn her gold Had her eyes upon it shone But he keepeth in bed so cold And his beauty is all its own Her hair it is black as the ink Her eyes they are bright as the sky Her lips are as red as the pink Her neck does the Lily Outvie The Oak apple hangs on the bough She's as soft as the summer hours Oh could I but meet with her now Where the moonbeams are playing wi flowers GO NOT NIGH HER DWELLING Go not nigh her dwelling You're caught if you do Her eye it flashes lig[h]tning That pierces one quite through She comes with her pretences Like a dew drop is her tread You'll surely lose your senses If you dare to turn your head All scentless are the roses As in hedges they do glow She comes and she proposes That you will with her go The wild flowers will stoop When they hear the bee sing But if on her you look You're a desolate thing Twenty years have I woo'ed her She is not yet won Like a slave I ha' loo'ed her Thus far I'm undone Love wishes were brief no's When I urged her to stay But she plucked a rose And went singing away She comes like the morning In purple and grey But me she is scorning As I pass on my way I see her pass by me Her eyes beaming bright Why does she deny me And say ‘quit my sight’! Her heart's without love She has beauty alone No fond one can move That cold heart o' stone My heart wi love bled As I pass'd her to day She turn'd not her head My love melted away COME LOVELY MARY Come my love the summers day Has brought the Cuckows to green trees Oh come my Mary come away And let us share the woodland breeze The woodland breeze I love to share Where green leaves whisper all the day Come hither with thy face so fair Mary my loved one come away I would not for a world of gold Thy innocence from beauty steal Sweet is thy face which I behold All its Love memories I feel The swaying boughs the shaking leaves And every rural sight and sound The soft wind secret spells he weaves In every flower spread o'er the ground Come lovely Mary come away The fields are green the skies are clear By flag fringed brooks we'll gladly stray Where wild and sweetest flowers appear The Maple's in its brightest gloss The hazel's in its crimpled sheen Green is the wood path we shall cross Come Mary to the woodland green COME HELEN MY RARE ONE The Springs come for good now And green is the wood bough And sweetly the wild birds are singing to day The primrose bloom shoots Close by hazel roots And white shines the May bloom upon the thorn spray Come my young day dream Let us walk by the May stream Where the water is purling clear over the stones And the little birds twitter Where they spangle and glitter As the waters glide on with their musical tones Come hither sweet Hellen Where echoes are telling Sweet stories of spring in its beautiful green Where birds they are singing And bees they are bringing Their thigh loads of honey &amp;

ne'er be weary The sun it glints on berries red All clustering on leaves make a bed While wool pack clouds sail over head While the lark winnows cheery The Bittern bumps the Pewit screams The Moor hen patters down the streams And glittering are the sunny beams Those scenes we'll seek my deary Full slowly flaps the heron by Uttering her lowly cranking cry The lark is winnowing in the sky And all the scene looks cheery Lassie leave thy mithers hall Take thy bonnet fra the wall Hurry on thy plaided shawl Or maybe love will cheat me Remember love the osier glen Full far away fra haunts o' men We met there ance and will agen There love &amp;

water flowers Their hue is neither white or black As they bluim in dusky hours Oh Lucy with thy bonnet on Were thou but standing here I would not envy any one This evetide would be dear BY YON BURNSIDE We'll meet by the glen side we'll meet by the burn Where grows the rath primrose &amp;

how lovely you seem, Your sweet spreading oaks and your braken so green, Your green plots as sweet as a shepherd boy's dream, 'Neath the shade of dark trees where I've many a day been, And sitting in braken or roots of the lime, Amusing my leisure in ballads and rhyme. [How beautiful May and its morning comes in!] How beautiful May and its morning comes in! The song of the maidens you hear them begin, To sing the old ballads while cowslips they pull, While the dew of the morning fills many pips full. The closes are spangled with cowslips like gold, Girls cram in their aprons what baskets can't hold; And still gather on to the heat of the day, Till force often throws the last handful away. Then beneath an old hawthorn they sit one and all, And make the May garlands and round cuck a ball Of cowslips and blossoms so showy and sweet, And laugh when they think of the swains they shall meet. Then to finish the garland they trudge away home, And beg from each garden the flowers then in bloom; Then beneath the old eldern, beside the old wall, They sit out to make it, maids, misses, and all. The ribbons the ploughmen bought maids at the fair, Are sure to be seen in a garland so fair; And dolls from the children they dress up and take, While children laugh loud at the show they will make. Then they take round the garland to shew at each door, With kerchief to hide the fine flowers cover'd o'er; At cottages also, when willing to pay, The maidens their much admired garland display. Then at duck under water adown the long road, They run with their dresses all flying abroad; And ribbons all colours how sweet they appear! May seems to begin the new life of the year. Then the garland on ropes is hung high over all, One end to a tree and one hooked to a wall; Where they cuck the ball over till day is nigh gone, And then tea and cakes and the dancing comes on. And then, lawk! what dancing and laughing is there, While the fidler makes faces within the arm chair; And then comes the cushion, the girls they all shriek And fly to the door from the old fiddler's squeak; But the doors they are fastened, so all must kneel down And take the rude kiss from the unmannerly clown. Thus the May games are ended, to their houses they roam, With the sweetheart she chooses each maiden goes home.
