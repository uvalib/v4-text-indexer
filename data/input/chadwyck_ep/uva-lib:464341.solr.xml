      <field name="fulltext">Dixero siquid jocosius, hoc mihi juris Cum Venia dabis ? Hor. 1. Sat. 4.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable, Sir J. Robinson Knight and Baronet, his Majesties Lieutenant of the Tower of LONDON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Ingenious Authour Mr. Alexand. Brome. Praise is the shade of Vertue, and ne're fell Into contempt, till Men ceas'd to do well. 'Twas profit spoyld the world. Till then (we know it,) The Usurer strook sayles unto the Poet. Kings envyed them their bayes; for though the Crown Had more of lustre, it had less renown. Then be thou Brome, my Subject; Thou whose mind Large, as the bounds of Nature, hath calcin'd Things high and low, and drawn conceptions thence, Which Adam scarcely knew in's innocence, T' adorne thy stile, and feed poetick fire, And make thy high-flown Raptures to fly higher: What can be thought or said to set thee forth? Or what Embellishment can guild thy worth? Great Merits (like good Claret) need no sign (Who ere proclaimed that the Sun did shine?) Tis easie to begin, but hard to end; When but to speak thy Name, is to commend. But leave I thee the Fountain; for the stream, Thy book, is now my more peculiar Theame, The Sceane of Wine and Women. Thy smart pen Refines our Loves, and liquors ore agen, And teaches us new lessons. Shall I whine To a coy Mistress, swear, and lye, and pine, And dye, and live again, and change more shapes, Then Proteus did, or four and fourty Apes, To win my loss of Liberty, when I, Enthron'd by fancy in true Soveraignty, Can out of nothing, whensoere I please, Create a million of such Mistresses? And write a Sonnet to my Aiery she, Or steal a better Sonnet (Brome) from Thee? No, No, for know my loves best bill of Dyet Is first free thoughts, the next is to be quiet. Hence too I'll quit the Tavernes, for I find No Wine is like the Nectar of the Mind. Conceit is a good Cellar; Here we may Drink without sin, and spend without Decay, And frolike and be merry; Or else we May read thy book, and tipple Poetry; And sing the prayses of the nobler Vine, And send a health to the great God of wine. This, This, is pleasure, and cheap too, thats better, For know the Muse is apt to be a debtor. All this we learn from thee; go on, and be A miracle in future History. Thou shewest us mirth, and nobler wayes to wo; And Vindicatest thy profession too. If Law and Business can produce such strains, Wee'l owe no Wit to leasure but to Brains. W. Paulet E medio Templo. To the Ingenious Author Mr. A. B. How! how! what miracles in print? A Poem with the Politicks in't? Tis strange, but I will not rehearse All the Probatums of thy verse. This only: when the nose and Bum Had frighted all our miseries dumb, When force hag-rid our Land and Seas, Had made lawes truths Antipodes; When treason, (like the blood) was found To circulate all England round; Thou Brome to cure the Kingdoms wrong Didst hatch new loyalty with a song. Musick (as once Sauls eldest Devil) Fetter'd Rebellions rampant evil; Rime of times over-reaches reason; A verse will counter-charme a treason. Had Cromwell learn't the grace to sing, He had fled to Heaven for his King. Rob. Napeir E medio Templo. To my ingenious Friend Mr. Brome, on his various and excellent Poems: An humble Eglog. Daman and Dorus. VVritten the 29. of May, 1660. Daman. Hail happy day! Dorus, sit down: Now let no sigh, nor let a frown Lodge near thy heart, or on thy brow. The King! the King's return'd! and now Lets banish all sad thoughts, and sing We have our lawes, and have our King. Dorus. Tis true and I wood sing, but oh! These wars have shrunk my heart so low Twill not be rais'd. Daman. What not this day? VVhy tis the twenty ninth of May: Let Rebels spirits sink: let those That like the Goths and Vandals rose To ruine families, and bring Contempt upon our Church, our King, And all that's dear to us, be sad; But be not thou, let us be glad. And Dorus, to invite thee, look, Here's a Collection in this book Of all those chearfull songs, that we Have sung with mirth and merry-gle: As we have march'd to fight the cause Of Gods anoynted, and our lawes: Such songs as make not the least ods Betwixt us mortals and the Gods: Such songs as Virgins need not fear To sing, or a grave Matron hear. Here's love drest neat, and chast, and gay As gardens in the month of May; Here's harmony, and wit, and art, To raise thy thoughts, and chear thy heart. Dorus. Written by whom? Daman. A friend of mine, And one that's worthy to be thine: A Civil swain, that knowes his times For businesses, and that done, makes rimes; But not till then: my Friends a man Lov'd by the Muses; dear to Pan; He blest him with a chearfull heart: And they with this sharp wit and art, Which he so tempers, as no Swain, That's loyal, does or shou'd complain. Dorus. I woo'd fain see him: Daman. Go with me. Dorus. To yonder broad beech tree, There we shall meet him and Phillis, Perrigot, and Amaryllis, Tyterus, and his dear Clora, Tom and Will, and their Pastora: There we'l dance, shake hands and sing, We have our Lawes, God bless the King. Iz. Walton. To my worthy Friend Mr. Alex. Brome. Wine nere to run more clear through quill was made, Then through thine is the praise of it convey'd; And as by Xeuxis grapes so painted were, That even birds, to peck at them drew near; So, wh, thy lively Poems see, will think That as they read of the Grapes juice, they drink: Thou doest not treat us with short Epigrams, Like Usurers glasses, only holding drams But in thy Songs thy wit is copious found, As Wine in Conduits when a King is crown'd. There strength of fancy, to it sweetness joynes, Unmixt with water, nor stum'd with strong lines. The lover who in many a frosty night, Did Serenade his Mistress out of sight, And to his Gittar songs most doleful howle In cousort with th' Bellman and the Ovvle, Now takes his Brimmer off, and to her flyes, Singing thy Rhimes, and straight she is his prize. She doth no more her Red-nos'd lover scorn, But fairer thinks then blushes of the morn; And would have Hymens torches lighted he By th' nose, that's to linck-boy compared by thee. He tells her no part of a woman ought Unto Starrs, Sun, globes, roses like be thought; But that those names which raise so high a pride, Are but to Taverns fit to be applyed. A Country Parson ith' Rumps reign did woe His auditory Honesty to do, And wear brave souls, which he enforc'd by those Thy songs only reform'd by him to prose, Which he had heard at market over night: Thus do thy fancies profit and delight. Carry the cause then for this man in black, That he may have from Vintners tithes of Sack; Wherein he will not crave so much, as did The Levite who some of his Parish bid; That said to Greenland that they should not fail Thence of their prey to bring him the tenth Whale. But to reward him higher, let him get Tithes of thy muse, and so be out of's debt. And now me thinks, while thou abroad dost shew Thy self in print to the Worlds open view, From all that vvear brave souls no voice doth stir, But vvelcome Sir, y'are kindly vvelcome Sir. Yet if the envious at thee do repine, They shall be but like flies drown'd in thy Wine. C. VV. SONG. I. Plain Dealing. 1 Well well, 'tis true I am now falne in Love, And 'tis with You: And now I plainly see, While you're enthron'd by me above, You all your arts and pow'rs improve To Tyrant over me; And make my flames th'incentives of your scorn, While you rejoyce, and feast your eyes to see me thus forlorn. 2 But yet be wise, And don't beleeve that I Did think your eyes More bright than Stars can be; Or that your face Angels outvyes In their Cœlestial Liveries; 'Twas all but Poetrie. I could have said as much by any she, You are not beauteous of your self, but are made so by me. 3 Though we, like Fools, Fathome the Earth and Sky, And drayne the Schools For names t'express you by: Out-rant the lowd'st Hyperbole's To dub you Saints and Deities, By Cupids Heraldry. We know you're Flesh and Blood as well as men, And when we will can mortalize, and make you so agen. 4 Yet since my Fate Has drawn me to this Sin Which I did hate, I'll not my labour lose But will love on, as I begin, To the purpose now my hand is in, Spite of those Arts you use. And let you know the World is not so bare, There's things enough to love, besides such Toyes as Ladies are. 5 I'll love good Wine, I'll love my Book and Muse, Nay all the Nine, I'll Love my real Friend, I'll Love my horse, and could I chuse One that would not my Love abuse, To her my heart should bend. I will love those that laugh, and those that sing, I'll love my Country, Prince and Laws, and those that love the King. SONG. II. The Indifferent. [1] Mistake me not, I am not of that mind To hate all woman kind; Nor can you so my patience vex; To make my Muse blaspheme your sex, Nor with my Satyrs bite you; Though there are some in your free-State. Some things in you, who 're Candidate, That he who is, or loves himself, must hate; Yet I'll not therefore slight you. For I'm a Schismatick in Love, And what makes most abhorr it, In me does more affection move, And I love the better for it. 2 I vow, I am so farr from loving none, That I love every one; If fair I must, if brown she be, She's lovely, and for Sympathy, 'Cause we're alike, I love her; If tall, she's proper; and if short; She's humble and I love her for't, Small's pretty, fat is pleasant, every sort Some graceful good discover; If young, she's plyant to the sport; And if her visage carry Gray hairs and wrinkles, yet I'll court, And so turn Antiquary. 3 Be her hair red, be her lips gray or blew, Or any other hue, Or has she but the ruins of a nose, Or but eye-sockets, I'le love those; Though skales, not skin, does clothe her, Though from her lungs, the sent that comes Does rowt her teeth out of their gums; I'll count all this for high Encomiums, Nor will I therefore loath her. There are no rules for beauty, but 'Tis as our fancies make it: Be you but kind, I'll think you fair And all for truth shall take it. SONG. III. The Resolve. [1] Tell me not of a face that's fair, Nor lip and cheek that's red, Nor of the tresses of her hair, Nor curles in order laid; Nor of a rare seraphick voice, That like an Angel sings; Though if I were to take my choice, I would have all these things. But if that thou wilt have me love And it must be a she, The only argument can move Is, that she will love me. 2 The glories of your Ladies be But Metaphors of things; And but resemble what we see Each common object brings. Roses out-red their lips and cheeks, Lillies their whitenesse stain: What fool is he that shadows seeks And may the substance gain? Then if thou'lt have me love a Lass Let it be one that's kind, Else I'm a servant to the glass That's with Canary lin'd. SONG. IV. The Wary Woer. 1 Faith, you're mistaken, I'le not love That face that frowns on me, Though it be handsom, 'tshall not move My centered soul that's farr above The magick of a paint, That on a Devil writes a Saint: I hate your pictures and imagery. I'm no love-Sinon, nor will tamely now Lie swadled in the trenches of your brow. 2 Though you are witty what care I? My danger is the more; Nay should you boast of honesty Woman gives all those names the Lie: In all you hardly can Write after that fair copy, Man; And dable in the steps we've gone before. We you admire, as we do parots all Not speaking well, but that they speak at all. 3 That Lass mine armes desire t'enfold, Born in the golden age, Guarded with Angels, but of Gold, She that's in such a showre enroll'd May tempt a Jove to be Guilty of Loves Idolatry, And make a pleasure of an Hermitage; Ynough their teeth are not, if their necks wear pearl A Kichin wench is consort for an Earl. 4 'Tis money makes the man, you say, 'Tshall make the Woman too; When both are clad in like aray December rivals youthful May: This rules the World, and this Perfection of both sexes is; This Flora made a Goddess, so 'twill you: This makes us laugh, this makes us drink and sing; This makes the beggar trample o're his King. SONG. V. The Counsel. 1 Why's my friend so melancholy? Prethee why so sad, why so sad? Beauty's vain, and Love's a folly, Wealth and women make men mad. To him that has a heart that's jolly Nothing's grievous, Nothing's sad. Come cheer up my Lad. 2 Does thy mistresse seem to fly thee? Prethee don't repine, don't repine: If at first she does deny thee Of her love, deny her thine; She shews her coynesse but to try thee, And will triumph if thou pine. Drown thy thoughts in wine. 3 Try again, and don't give over, Ply her, she's thine own, she's thine own; Cowardise undoes a Lover. They are Tyrants if you moan; If nor thy self, nor love can move her, But she'l slight thee and be gone: Let her then alone. 4 If thy courtship can't invite her, Nor to condescend, nor to bend; Thy only wisdom is to slight her, And her beauty discommend. Such a nicenesse will requite her; Yet if thy Love will not end, Love thy self and friend. SONG. VI. To his Mistress. 1 Lady you'l wonder when you see With those bright twins of eyes, The ragged lines that crawle from me, And note the contrarietie That both in them and in their Authour lyes. 2 I that came hither with a breast Coated with Male about; Proof 'gainst your beauty, and the rest, And had no room for Love to nest, Where reason lodgd within, and love kept out. 3 My thoughts turn'd, like the needle, about, Touched by Magnetick love: And fain would find some North-pole out, But waver'd 'twixt desire and doubt; Till now they're fixt, and point to you above. 4 Lend me one ray, and do but shine Upon my verse, and me; Your beauty can enrich a line, And so you'l make 'um yours, not mine; Since ther's no Helicon like love and thee. SONG. VII. To his Mistress. 1 Why dost thou frown, my dear, on me? Come change that angry face. What though I kist that Prodigie, And did her ugly limbs embrace? 'Twas only cause thou wert in place. 2 Had I suckd poyson from her breath, One kiss could set me free: Thy lip's an Antidote 'gainst Death; Nor would I ever wish to be Cur'd of a sickness but by thee. 3 The little birds for dirt repair Down from the purer skie, And shall not I kiss foul and fair? Wilt thou give Birds more pow'r than I? Fye, 'tis a serupulous nicety. 4 When all the World I've ranged about, All beauties else to spy, And, at the last, can find none out, Equal to thee in beauty; I Will make thee my sole Deity. SONG. VIII. The hard Heart 1 Still so hard-hearted? what may be The sin thou hast committed? That now the angry Deity Has to a Rock congealed thee, And thus thy hardnesse fitted? To make one act both sin and curse, And plague thy hardness with a worse. 2 Till thee there never was but one Was to a Rock translated, Poor Niobe that weeping stone: She ever did, thou ne're dost, moan, Nor is thy scorn abated. The tears I send to thee are grown Of that same nature, and turn stone. 3 Yet I, dear Rock, must worship thee, Love works this superstition, And justifies th' Idolatry That's shown to such a stone as thee, Where it foreruns fruition. Thou'rt so magnetick, that I can No more leave thee than to be Man. 4 But thou, I warrant thee, do'st suppose This new design will slay me, And ravel out my life with woes Till death, at last, mine eyes shall close; That all may read, lo here I ly Tomb'd in thy heart, slain by thine eye. 5 But I, I vow, will be more wise, And love with such discretion; When I read coynesse in thy eyes, I'll roab mine with like cruelties, And kill with prepossession. Then I'll turn stone, and so will be An endless monument to thee. SONG IX. Loves Anarchy. 1 Love, I must tell thee, I'l no longer be A Victime to thy beardless Deity: Nor shall this heart of mine, Now 'tis return'd, Be offered at thy shrine, Or at thine Altar burn'd. Love, like Religion's made an aiery name, To awe those souls whom want of wit makes tame. 2 There's no such thing as Quiver, Shafts or Bow, Nor does Love wound, but men imagine so. Or if it does perplex And grieve the mind, 'Tis the poor masculine sex: Women no sorrows find. 'Tis not our persons, nor our parts, can move 'um, Nor is't men's worth, but wealth, makes Ladies love 'um. 3 Reason henceforth, not love, shall be my guide, My fellow-creatures shant be Deified; I'le now a rebel be, And so pull down That Distaff-Monarchy, And Femals fancy'd crown. In these unbridled times who would not strive To free his neck from all prerogative? SONG. X The Libertine. 1 Peerswade me not, I vow I'le love no more, My heart has now ta'ne quarter; My fetters I'll no more adore, Nor madly run, as heretofore, To break my freedoms Charter: He, that once fails, may try again; But who so often fool'd has been, And still attempts, commits a triple fin: He's his own humours Martyr. I'll use my liberty to run Abroad, and still be choosing: Who would confine himself to one That has power of refusing? 2 The unconfined Bee, we see, has power, To kiss and feel each flower; Nor is his pleasures limited To the ruines of one maidenhead, Nor tyed to ones embraces: But having's will of one, he'l fly 'Tanother, and there load his thigh. Why should he have more priviledg than I? Since both our amorous cases Differ in this alone; his thighs, When he abroad doth rome, Loaden with spoyls return. But mine Come weak and empty home. 3 The self same beauty that I've often sworn Dwelt only in my dearest, I see by other Ladies worn, Whom the same Graces do adorn: I like that face that's nearest. This I salute, and walk with that; With this I sing, with t'other chat, I've none to Catechize me where? or what? Nor will be ty'd t' a Querist. Thus out of all, Pigmalion like, My fancy limns a woman; To her I freely sacrifice, And rivald am by no man. SONG. XI. The Contrary. [1] Nay prithee do, be coy and slight me, I must love, though thou abhor it; This pretty niceness does invite me: Scorne me, and I'll love thee for it. That World of beauty that is in you, I'll overcome like Alexander. In amorous flames I can continue Unsing'd, and prove a Salamander. 2 Do not be won too soon I prethee, But let me woe, whilst thou dost fly me. 'Tis my delight to dally with thee, I'll court thee still if thou'lt deny me; For there's no happiness but loving, Enjoyment makes our pleasures flat. Give me the heart that's alwayes moving, And's not confind t'one you know what. 3 I've fresh supplies on all occasions, Of thoughts, as Various as your face is, No Directory for evasions, Nor will I court by common-places. My heart's with Antidotes provided, Nor will I dye 'cause you frown on me; I'm merry when I am derided, VVhen you laugh at me or upon me. 4 'Tis fancy that creates those pleasures That have no being but conceited; And when we come to dig those treasures, We see our selves our selves have cheated: But if th'art minded to destroy me, Then love me much, and love me ever, I'll love thee more, and that may slay me, So I thy Martyr am, or never. SONG XI. The Young Lover. [1] Tush! never tell me, I'm too young For loving, or too Green, She stayes at least seven years too long That's wedded at fourteen. Age and Discretion fit Grave Matrons, whose desires and youths are past. Love needs not, nor has wit. They in whose youthful breast dwells nought but frost Can only mourn the dayes, and joyes, they've lost. 2 Lambs bring forth Lambs, and Doves bring Doves As soon as they'r begotten: Then why should Ladies finger loves, As if not ripe till rotten. 'Tis envious age perswades This tedious heresy for men to woe Stale Nimphs and Vestal maids, While they in modesty must answer No. Late Love, like late Repentance, seldom's true. 3 Gray hairs are fitter for the Grave Than for the bridal bed; VVhat pleasure can a lover have In whither'd Maidenhead? Dry bones and rotten limbs Make Hymens Temple turn an Hospital: Age all our beauty dimms. Though Lands must not till one and twenty fall, The laws to love prescribe no time at all. 4 Nature's exalted in one time; And what our Grandames then At four and twenty scarce coul'd climbe, VVe can arrive at ten. Youth of it self doth bring us Provocatives within, and we do scorn Love-powders and Eringoes. Cupid himself's a child, and 'twill be sworn, Lovers like poets, are not made, but born. SONG. XII. To his Mistress. 1 My Theodora, can those eyes From whence such glories shine Give light to every soul that pryes, And only be obscur'd to mine, VVho willingly my heart resigne, Enflam'd by you, to be your sacrifice? 2 Send out one beam t'enrich my soul, And chase this gloomy shade, That does in clouds about me roul, And in my breast a hell has made; VVhere fire still burns, still flames invade. And yet lights pow'r and comfort both controul. 3 Then, out of gratitude, I'll send Some of my flames to thee, Thus lovingly our gifts we'll blend; And both in joyes shall wealthy be: And love, though blind, shall learn to see, Since you an eye to him and me can lend. SONG XIII. To a Widow. 1 Nay, dry (for shame) those blubber'd eyes, And cease to sigh that breath away, Fates are not mov'd with tears and cryes, Nor formal sighs as vain as they. Joyes are not joyes, that alwaies stay, And constant pleasures do'nt delight but cloy. 2 Though he be gone, that was your dear, You must not ever mourne and pine? The Sun that's buried the last Year, Does now in newer glory shine. Your Nuptial joyes and pleasures be Not dead, but only inherited by me. 3 Hymen's an Artist, and can do The next time better then before, Giants great heights can reach unto, But on their shoulders dwarfs reach more. Men more refin'd do dayly grow, The nearer to Divinity they go. 4 Then don't (my dear) thy heart confine, To one whose being's past away, And make me with desires to pine, Whilst he must glut, that can't injoy. Love's stifled, when it is confind, To this or that; its object is mankind. SONG. XIV. To his Friend that had vow'd Small-Bear. 1 Leave off fond Hermite, leave thy vow, And fall again to drinking That beautie that wont sack allow, Is hardly worth thy thinking, Dry love or small can never hold, And without Bacchus Venus soon grows cold. 2 Doest think by turning Anchorite; Or a dull small-Bear sinner. Thy cold embraces can invite, Or sprightless Courtship win her? No, 'tis Canary that inspires, 'Tis Sack, like Oyle, gives Flames to am'rous Fiers. 3 This makes thee chant thy Mistresse name, And to the heavens to raise her; And range this universal frame For Epithets to praise her. Low liquours render brains unwitty, And ne're provoke to love, but move to pity. 4 Then be thy self, and take thy Glasse, Leave off this dry Devotion, Thou must like Neptune court thy lass, Wallowing in Nectars Ocean, Let's offer at each Ladies shrine, A full crown'd bowl, first here's a health to thine. SONG. XV. On Claret. [1] Whithin this bottle's to be seen, A scarlet liquor that has been Born of the royal vine; We but nick name it when we call It Gods drink, who drink none at all, No higher name then Wine 2 'Tis Ladies liquor: here one might Feast both his eye and appetite, With beauty and with tast, Cherries and Roses which you seek. Upon your Mistress lip and cheek Are here together plac't. 3 Physitians may prescribe their whey To purge our Reins and Brains away, And clarify the Blood, That cures one sicknesse with another, This routs by wholesale altogether, And drowns them in a flood. 4 This Poets makes, else how could I, Thus ramble into Poetrie, Nay and write Sonnets too; If there's such pow'r in junior wines, To make one venture upon lines What could Canary do? 5 Then squeze the vessels bowels out And deal it faithfully about, Crown each hand with a brimmer; Since we're to pass through this red sea, Our noses shall our Pilots be And every soul a swimmer. SONG. XVI. A Mock Song. [1.] 'Tis true, I never was in love: But now I mean to be, For there's no art Can shield a heart From loves Supremacie. 2. Though in my nonage I have seen A world of taking faces; I had not age nor wit to ken There several hidden graces. 3. Those vertues which though thinly set, In others are admired, In thee are altogether met, Which make thee so desired. 4. That though I never was in Love Nor never meant to be Thy self and parts Above my arts Have drawn my heart to thee. SONG. XVII. Reasons of Love. [1] Prethee, why dost thou love me so? Or is it but in show? What is there that your thoughts can pick about me? If beauty in my face you view, 'Twas ne're writ there unlesse by you, I little find within, nor you without me. 2 I han't the Rhetorick of the foot: Nor leane long leg to boot, Nor can I court with congees, trips, and dances; I seldom sing, or if I do, You'll scarce tell where I sing or no, I can't endure Love-stories and Romances. 3 I neither know, nor love to play And fool my time away; Nor talk in Dialects to please your fancy: Nor carve the Capon or the Quaile But hew it through from head to tail, A complement to me is Negromancy. 4 I boast not of a pedigree, That Lords or Lordlings be, Nor do I lace my name with Grandsires story, Nor will I take the pains to look For a fools-coat i'th Heralds book, My fame's mine own, no monumental glory. 5 I am not fashion'd of the mode, Nor rant ith' Gallants rode, Nor in my habit do observe decorum, Perfumes shall not my breath bely, Nor clothes my body glorifie, They shall derive their honour, 'cause I were 'um. 6 No frizling nor scarce locks, and yet Perhaps more hair then wit: Nor shall Sweet-powders vanity delight you; Though my hair's little, I'le not carry A wig for an Auxiliary. If my locks can't, anothers shant invite you. 7 And which is worse, I cannot woe With Gold as others do, Nor bait your love, with Lordships, Lands, &amp; Towers; Just so much money I have by, As serves to spoil my poetry Not to expose me to the higher powers. 8 Nay you shan't make a fool of me, Though I no Statist be, Nor shall I be so valliant to fight for ye, I han't the patience to court, Nor did I e're do't, but in sport I wont run mad for love, nor yet go marry. 9 And yet I know some cause does move, Though it be not pure love 'Tis for you honours sake that you affect me, For well you know, she that's my Lass, Is canoniz'd in every glass, And her health's drunk, by all that do respect me. 10 Then love thou on, I'le tipple till Both of us have our fill, And so thy name shall never be forgotten I'll make thee Hellens fame survive, Though she be dead and thou alive, For though thou'rt not so old, thy heart's as rotten SONG. XVIII. Epithalamy. [1] Nay fie, Platonicks, still adoring, The fond Chymæra's of your brain? Still on that empty nothing poring? And only follow what you faigne? Live in your humour, 'tis a curse So bad, 'twere pity wish a worse. We'l banish such conceits as those, Since he that has enjoyment knows, More bliss then Plato could suppose. 2 Cashiered woers, whose low merit Could ne're arrive at nuptial bliss, Turn schismaticks in love, whose spirit Would have none bit 'cause they do miss. But those reproaches that they vent Do only blaze their discontent Condemn'd mens words no truth can show, And Hunters when they prove to slow Cry Hares are dry meat, let 'um go. 3 Th' inamour'd youth, whose flaming brest Makes Goddesses and Angels all In's contemplation finds no rest, For all his joyes are scepticall, At his fruition flings away His Cloris and his Welladay And gladly joynes to fill our Quire. Who to such happinesse aspire As all must envy or admire. SONG. XIX. An Ode of Anacreon paraphrased. Beauties force. [1] I wonder why dame Nature thus Her various gifts dispences; She every creature else but us With arms, or armour fences. The Bull with bended horns she arms; With hoofs she guards the horse The hare can nimbly run from harms, All know the Lyons force. 2 The Bird can danger fly on's wing, She Fish with fins adornes, The Cuckold too, that harmlesse thing, His patience guards, and's horns. And Men she valiant makes and wise, To shun or baffle harmes; But to poor Women she denies Armour to give, or arms. 3 Instead of all, this she does do; Our Beauty she bestows, Which serves for arms and armour too, 'Gainst all our pow'rful Foes And 'tis no matter, so she doth Still beautious faces yield Wee'l conquer sword and fire, for both To beauty leave the field. SONG XX. Love's without Reason. [1] 'Tis not my Ladies face that makes me love her, Though beauty there doth rest, Enough t' inflame the breast Of one, that never did discover The glories of a face before; But I that have seen thousands more See nought in hers, but what in others are, Only because I think she's fair, she's fair. 2 'Tis not her vertues, nor those vast perfections, That crowd together in her, Ingage my soul to win her, For those are only brief Collections, Of what's in man in folio writ; Which by their imitative wit Women like Apes and Children strive to do; But we that have the substance slight the show. 3 'Tis not her birth, her friends, nor yet her treasure, My freeborn soul can hold; For chains are chains though gold; Nor do I court her for my pleasure, Nor for that old Moralitie Do I love her, 'cause she loves me? For that's no love, but gratitude, and all Loves, that from fortunes rise, with fortunes fall. 4 If friends, or birth, created love within me, Then Princes I'le adore, And only scorn the poor, If vertue or good parts could win me, I'ld turne Platonick and ne're vex My soul with difference of sex And he, that loves his Lady 'cause she's fair, Delights his eye, so loves himself, not her. 5 Reason and Wisdom are to love high treason, Nor can he truly love, Whose flame's not farr above, And far beyond his wit or reason, Then ask no reason for my fires, For infinite are my desires. Something there is moves me to love, and I Do know I love, but know not how, nor why. SONG. XXI. The Damoisel. [1] Since Women are still, By pretenders to skill, Suppos'd to be sway'd by their will, And not by their judgment nor reason, Then it shall be mine, To uphold the design, In spite of the hits Of the fellows call'd Wits That jeere every thing that's in season. 2 Though youthful I be, And buxome to see, And suppos'd to be frolick and free, And ripe for the thing you wot on I'le not sacrific'd be To the Gingerbread he Whose cloathes are in print And his hair has butter in't And his fancies and whimseys has got on. 3 For the Youth in their bud, That do sail in the flood, Of their active and flaming blood, Like furious undertakers; Are fiery at first, But have soon done their worst, Then they shrink their heads in And care not a pin For the sport, nor yet the sportmakers. 4 But give me that he That is threescore and three And can neither hear, smell or see, He will serve well enough for a cover; He will tickle, and touch, Though his strength be not much, He can't do, but desire, And that kindles his fire, While he fathers the sports of a lover. 5 O the tooth without peers! And the silver hairs! And the gouts, &amp; the coughs of old years! I would have such a one for the nones; I can Chronicles find, In his limbs, and his mind, While his face tells the story Of memento mori With an Almanack in his bones. SONG. XXII. A Dialogue. [1.] Amoris. O for the balmy curral of a lip! Where I with kissing Chimistry may sip. Castalian quaffs of Nectar to delight me, And every kiss may to a new invite me. Oenophil. Give me a bowl wherein I'll tumble Bacchus, To bath our souls, we'l drink 'till sack doth crack us Midas. But let my chests groan with the gilded oar, Where having much is prologue unto more. Oenophil. Who doats on beautie, fancies but a toy. Midas. Who Wine adores does overwhelme his joy. Oenophil. And he that gapes for gaudy dirt or treasure, Sill feels desires, but no content nor pleasure. Chorus. Then let's unite our desires, but let reason be our guide What in each is not found in all swels like a tide. 2. Amoret. A beautious face can a young fancy raise, And mirtle glorifies, as well as Bayes. Love, like the soul, informes the flesh that's stupid, Nor can Apollo more inspire then Cupid. Oenophil. Where full-fraught cups, with sprightly liquors flow, it Unwraps your brain, and makes each wight a Poet. Midas. Where boundless treasure raigns 'twil raise the soul, And wit and love both conquer and controul. Amoret. Still give me love, give me my lovely lasse. Oenophil. I'll count no other mistresse, but the glass. Midas. But give me chink, nor love, nor wit shall plague us. For Poe and Hippocrene both vail to Tagus. Chorus. Then let's unite our desires, but let reason be our guide What in each is not found in all swels like a tide. To his Mistres affrighted in the wars. [1] Come sigh no more, but kiss again, These troubles shall never trouble me; Your sighs are but wind, &amp; your sorrows vain; They'l never the sooner for us agree. Let Canons keep roaring And bullets still flying; While I am adoring Thee, my deity. Hang this wealth! let money flee, They cannot undo me, while I have thee. 2 I'll be thy Champion to defend Thy person from all these dangers and harms; No Army's so sure as a real friend, Nor Castle defends like a lovers arms. But if I can't daunt 'um, By valour and might Your face shall enchant 'um, For beauty can fight. There's no armour can men free From the naked pow'r of such beauties as thee. 3 I Venus serve, a fig for Mars, Loves arrows may wound, but never kill me; Me thinks there's no pleasure in bloody wars, But I long to be wounded and taken by thee? When our bullets are kisses, And our field is a bed, And the top of our bliss is A pure maidenhead. Both will strive to lose the day, And both shall be conquer'd &amp; yet not run away. Upon the Cavaleers departing out of London. [1] Now fare thee well London, Thou next must be undone, 'Cause thou hast undone us before; This cause and this tyrant, Had never plaid this high rant Were't not for thy argent and Or. 2 Now we must desert thee, With the lines that begirt thee, And the red-coated Saints domineer, Who with liberty fool thee, While a Monster doth rule thee, And thou feelst what before thou didst fear. 3 Now justice and freedom With the laws that did breed 'um, Are sent to Jamaca for gold, And those that upheld 'um, Have power but seldom, For justice is barter'd and sold. 4 Now the Christian Religion Must seek a new Region, And the old Saints give way to the new; And we that are loyal Vail to those that destroy all, VVhen the Christian gives place to the Jew. 5 But this is our glory In this wretched story, Calamities fall on the best; And those that destroy us Do better employ us, To sing till they are supprest. On the fall of the prices of wine. 1 Now our thanks to our powers above us, And to him that above them doth sit, Who to shew how intirely they love us, Have found out the way To repair the decay Of the famished and foundered Wit, And new drench the Poetical Tit. Chorus. Welcome desired August to us Thou Comfort and delight do'st give us, Twas November did undo us, But 'tis August does relieve us. 2 Give's a rowsing bear glass of Canary, The half pint and thimble's our foe; VVe will be no more tributary To the Spaniards pride, Nor make Vintners ride, When we are not able to go, Or dare not our faces to show. Chorus, Welcome desired August to us &amp;c 3 VVe defie now the Malter and Hopper, Whose Pride would have made us surmise, Our Helicon lay in his Copper; And He'l sell wit and art, At three half pence a quart; And with that he would make us so wise, To be able to cheat the excise. Chorus, Welcome desired August to us &amp;c 4 Let us venture to take the Canaries, And then wee'll make sack of our own; For he that those Islands carries, VVins the Judges to boot, And all Spain added to't; The Turk and the Pope wee'l not own, But rule the whole VVorld alone. Choruss Welcome desired August to us &amp;c 5 'Tis the means and the end of our study, It does make our invention oreflow VVhile the channel of ale makes it muddy A Mayor or a Knight By bunches may write, If his theame be the grape, and by it Be esteem'd a Divine and a wit. Chorus, Welcome desired August to us &amp;c The Old Mans delight. By R. B. Ho boy, hay boy, Come come away boy, And bring me my longing desire, A Lass that is neat and can well do the feat, VVhen lusty, young, blood, is one fire. Let her body be tall, And her wast be small, And her age not above eighteen, Let her care for no bed, but here let her spread Her mantle upon the green. Let her face be fare, And her brests be bare. And a voice let her have that can warble, Let her belly be soft, but to mount me aloft, Let her bounding butocks be marble. The Addition by A. B. Let her have a cherry lip Where I Nectar may sip; Let her eyes be as black as a sloe; Dangling locks I do love, so that those hang above Are the same with what growes below. Oh such a bonny lass May bring wonders to pass, And make me grow younger and younger; And when ere we do part, she'l be mad at the heart That I am able to tarry no longer. BEN. JOHNSONS Sociable rules for the Apollo. Let none but Guests or Clubbers hither come, Let Dunces, Fools, sad, sordid men keep home, Let learned, civil, merry men b'invited, And modest too; Nor the choise Ladies slighted. Let nothing in the treate offend the Guests, More for delight then cost prepare the feasts. The Cook and Purvey'r must our pallats know, And none contend who shall sit high or low. Our waiters must quick-sighted be and dumb, And let the drawers hear and come. Let not our wine be mixt, but brisk and neat, Or else the drinkers may the Vintners beat. And let our only emulation be, Not drinking much, but talking wittily. Let it be voted lawful to stir up Each other with a moderate chirping cup, Let not our Company be, or talk too much, On serious things or sacred let's not touch With sated heads and bellies. Neither may Fidlers unask'd obtrude themselves to play. With laughing, leaping, dancing, jests and songs, And what ere else to gratful mirth belongs, Let's celebrate our feasts; And let us see That all our jests without reflection be. Insipid Poems let no man rehearse Nor any be compell'd to write a verse. All noise of vain disputes must be forborne, And let no lover in a corner mourne. To fight and brawl (like Hectors) let none dare, Glasses or windowes break, or hangings tare. Who ere shall publish what's here done or said, From our Society must be banished. Let none by drinking do or suffer harme, And while we stay, let us be alwayes warm. SONG. XXIII. Courtship. 1 My Lesbia, let us live and love, Let crabbed Age talk what it will, The Sun though down returns above, But we, once dead, must be so still. 2 Kiss me a thousand times, and then Give me a hundred kisses more, Now kiss a thousand times agen, Then tother hundred as before. 3 Come a third thousand, and to those Another hundred kisses fix; That done, to make the sweeter close, Wee'l millions of kisses mix. 4 And huddle them together so, That we our selves shan't know how many, And others can't their number know, If we should envy'd be by any. 5 And then, when we have done all this, That our pleasures may remain, We'l continue on our bliss, By unkissing all again. 6 Thus we'l love and thus we'l live, While our posting minutes fly, We'l have no time to vex or grieve, But kiss and unkiss till we die. SONG. XXIV. The Attempt. [1] Why should I blush or be dismai'd, To tell you I adore you? Since Love's a pow'r, that can't be staid, But must by all be once obey'd, And you as well as those before you. Your beauty hath enchain'd my mind, O let me not then cruel find. You which are fair, and therefore should be kind. 2 Fair as the light, pure as the Ray, That in the gray-ey'd morning Leaps forth, and propagates a day, Those glories which in others stray Meet all in you for your adorning. Since nature built that goodly frame, And Virtue has inspir'd the same, Let love draw yours to meet my raging flame. 3 Joy of my soul, the only thing, That's my delight and glory, From you alone my love does spring, If one love may another bring, 'Twill crown our happy story. Those fires I burne withall are pure And Noble, yet too strong t'endure; 'Twas you did wound, 'twas you that ought to cure. SONG XXV. To a Lady that turned her Cheek. [1] And why this coyness, Lady mine? What needs all this ado? 'Tis but a swap, my lips for thine, A gentle touch and goe. Nay let such kisses still be kept, Let him that is deny'd Your lip, and will your cheek accept, Lye only by your side. 2 I hate to kiss your druggs and foiles, 'Tis flesh that I affect, And you whose art your nature spoils, I like not, but suspect. Pray why's your mouth more shy then mine? Am't I as sound as you're? My lips let in as much good wine, And send out words as pure. 3 Expect no courtship more from me, Nor words, that you, and I May in our judgments plainly see, Make but a ranting lie: Leave these coy humours and be plain: Deny, or else be free, Look not for love, w'thout love again, I'le kiss, if you'l kiss me. SONG. XXVI. Practick Love. [1] Prithee Cælia tell me, why Thou fool'st away thy precious howers, Beauty fades, and youth doth fly, There's no trust to futurity. Time present's only in our powers. She that her present joys doth defer, Would love at the last, when none will love her, And so proves her own Idolater. 2 Either love or say you will not, For love or scorn's all one to me, Diversion's pleasant, though it fill not; Denialls vex us, but they kill not, We're murder'd by credulity, O 'tis a Tyranny still to invite, The mind, and inrage it with faigned delight, To raise and then baffle the appetite. 3 If you'ld let me be but quiet, Not see your face, nor hear your name, Though I can't conquer love, I'ld fly it, For abscence, businesse, friends or dyet Would quench or else divert my flame. But you're so imperious grown, and so cruel, 'Cause you see that my heart is cumbustible you will Not put out the fire, but still put in fuell. 4 'Twas not your face, nor yet my eye, That this devouring flame begot, If either did alone, pray why Did you not kill, and I not die Then when we knew each other not? 'Twas their constellation was my undoing, You by being beautious, and I by viewing Paid in contribution to my own ruine. 5 Come then let's love now while we may, And let me know what I may trust too, Desires are murdred by delay, Our youth and marrow will decay, And Love, for want of use, will rust too. This kissing and courting not any thing spels, In spite of the storie the Platonist tells, If it were not in order to something else. SONG. XXVII. Translated out of French. [1] Now I'm resolv'd to love no more, But sleep by Night, and drink by day: Your coynesse, Cloris, pray give o're, And turn your tempting eyes away. From Ladies I'le withdraw my heart And fix it only on the Quart. 2 I'll place no happiness of mine A puling beauty still to court And say she's glorious and divine, The Vintner makes the better sport. And when I say my Dear, my Heart. I only mean it to the Quart. 3 Love has no more prerogative, To make me desperate courses take, Nor me t'an Hermitage shall drive, I'le all my vowe to th'gobblet make And if I wear a Capuchoone It shall a Tankard be or none. 4Added. 'Tis Wine alone that cheers the soul, But love and Ladies make us sad; I'm merry when I court the bowl, While he that courts the Madam's mad, Then Ladies wonder not at me, For you are coy, but wine is free. SONG. XXVIII. Translated out of French. [1] Clymena still complains of me And I of her complain to; But would you know the cause, why we This quarrel did attain to. Tis 'cause I am not true saies she, And I say that again to. 2 I cannot choose but wonder why This lovely toy doth blame me, If my heart wears inconstancy; It is but what became me. Since she was fickle why not I? I'm but as she did frame me. 3 Time was I thought our flames of love, Would burn for ever brighter; But when she did so faithless prove, I vow'd I would requite her, I quickly did my flames remove, And now for ever slight her. SONG. XXIX. To a painted Lady. [1] Leave these deluding tricks and showes, Be honest and down-right; VVhat Nature did to view expose, Don't you keep out of sight. The novice youth may chance admire, Your dressings, paints and spells: But we that are expert desire Your sex for somewhat else. 2 In your adored face and hair, What vertue could you find, If Women were, like Angels fair And every man were blind. You need no time or pains to wast To set your beauties forth, With oyles, and paint and druggs, that cost More then the face is worth. 3 Nature her self, her own work does And hates all needless arts, And all your artificial showes Disgrace your Nat'ral parts. You're flesh and blood and so are we, Let flesh and blood alone, To Love all compounds hateful be, Give me the pure or none. SONG. XXX. To a coy Lady. [1] I prithee leave this peevish fashion, Don't desire to be high-priz'd, Love's a Princely noble passion, And doth scorne to be despis'd. Though we say you're fair, you know, We your beauty do bestow, For our fancy makes you so. 2 Don't be proud 'cause we adore you, We do't only for our pleasure, And those parts in which you glory, We by fancy weigh and measure. When for Deities you go, For Angels, or for Queens, pray know, 'Tis our fancy makes you so. 3 Don't suppose your Majesty By Tyrannie's best signified, And your Angellick natures be Distinguish'd only by your pride. Tyrants make Subjects rebells grow, And pride makes Angels Dev'ls below, And your pride may make you so. SONG. XXXI. The Recovery. [1] How unconcerned I can now Behold that face of thine! The Graces and the dresses to Which both conspire to make thee shine, And make me think thou art divine. 2 And yet me thinks thou'rt wondrous fair, But I have no desires, Those Glories in thy face that are, Kindled not in my heart those fires, For that remains, though this expires. 3 Nor was't my eyes that had such pow'r To burn my self and you, For then they'ld every thing devoure, But I do several others view, Unsing'd, and so don't think it true. 4 Nay both together could not do't, Else we had dy'd e're this, Whithout some higher po'wr to boot, Which must rule both, if either miss, All t'other to no purpose is. 5 It puzles my Phylosophy, To find wherein consists This pow'r of love, and tyranny, Or in a Lovers eye, or brest Be't where it will, there let it rest. SONG XXXII. Advice to Cælia. [1] My lovely Cælia, while thou dost enioy. Beauty and youth, be sure to use 'um, And be not fickle, be not coy, Thy self or Lovers to destroy. Since all those Lillies and those Roses, Which Lovers find, or love supposes, To flourish in thy face, Will tarry but a little space. And youth and beauty are but only lent To you by nature, with this good intent You should enjoy, but not abuse 'um, And when enjoyments may be had, not fondly to refuse 'um 2 Let lovers flatt'ry ne're prevail with thee; Nor their old complements deceive thee, Their vows and protestations be Too often meer Hypocrisie. And those high praises of the witty May all be costly, but not fit ye, Or if it true should be Now what thy lovers say of thee, Sicknesse or age will quickly strip away Those fading glories of thy youthful May. And of thy graces all bereave thee, Then those that thee ador'd before will slight thee and so leave thee. 3 Then while thou'rt fair &amp; young, be kind but wise, Doat not, nor proudly use denying; That tempting toy thy beauty lies Not in thy face, but lovers eyes. And he that doats on thee may smother His love, 'ith beautie of another, Or flying at all game May quench, or else divert his flame. His reason too may chance to interpose, And love declines as fast as reason grows. There is a knack to find loves treasures Too young, too old, too nice, too free, too slow, destroys your pleasures. SONG. I The Royalist. Written in 1646. [1] Come, pass about the bowl to me, A health to our distressed King; Though we're in hold, let cups go free, Birds in a cage may freely sing. The ground does tipple healths apace, When stormes do fall, and shall not we, sorrow dares not shew its face, When we are ships and sack's the sea. 2 Pox on this grief, hang wealth, let's sing, Shall's kill our selves for fear of death? We'l live by th' aire which songs do bring, Our sighing does but wast our breath. Then let us not be discontent, Nor drink a glass the lesse of Wine; In vain they'l think their plagues are spent, When once they see we don't repine. 3 We do not suffer here alone, Though we are beggar'd, so's the King, 'Tis sin t' have wealth, when he has none, Tush! poverty's a Royal thing! When we are larded well with drink, Our heads shall turn as round as theirs, Our feet shall rise, our bodies sink Clean down the wind, like Caveliers. 4 Fill this unnatural quart with sack, Nature all vacuums doth decline, Our selves will be a Zodiack, And every mouth shall be a sign. Me thinks the Travels of the glasse, Are circl ar like Plato's year; Where every thing is as it was, Let's tipple round; and so 'tis here. SONG. II. The Commoners. Written in 1645. [1] Come your wayes Bonny Boyes, Of the Town, For now is your time or never, Shall your fears Or your cares Cast you down? Hang your wealth And your health Get renown, We all are undone for ever. Now the King and the crown Are tumbling down, And the realm doth groan with disasters, And the scum of the land, Are the men that command, And our slaves are become our masters, 2 Now our lives Children, wives And Estate, Are a prey to the lust and plunder, To the rage Of our age. And the fate Of our land Is at hand, Tis too late To tread these Usurpers under. First down goes the crown, Then follows the gown Thus levell'd are we by the Roundhead, While Church and State must Feed their pride and their lust, And the Kingdom and King confounded. 3 Shall we still Suffer ill And be dumb? And let every Varlet undo us? Shall we doubt Of each Lowt, That doth come, With a voice Like the noise Of a Drum, And a sword or a Buffe-coate to us? Shall we lose our estates By plunder and rates To bedeck those proud upstarts that swagger, Rather fight for your meat, Which these Locusts do eat, Now every man's a beggar. SONG. III. The Pastorall. On the Kings death. Written in 1643. [1] Where England's Damon us'd to keep, In peace and awe, his flocks Who fed, not fed upon, his sheep, There Wolves and Tygres now do prey, There Sheep are slain, and Goats do sway, There raigns the subtle Fox While the poor Lamkins weep. 2 The Laurell'd garland which before Circled his brows about, The spotlesse coat which once he wore, The sheep-hook which he us'd to sway, And pipe whereon he lov'd to play, Are seized on by the rout, And must be us'd no more. 3 Poor Swain how thou lament'st to see Thy flocks o're-rul'd by those That serve thy Cattle all like thee, Where hatefull vice usurps the Crown, And Loyalty is trodden down; Down skrip and sheephook goes, When Foxes Shepheards be. SONG IV. A Mock-song. Hang up Mars And his wars Give us drink, We'l tiple my Lads together, Those are slaves, Fools and knaves, That have chink, And must pay, For what they say, Do, or think, Good fellows accompt for neither, Be we round, be we square, We are happier then they're Whose dignity works their ruine, He that well the bowl rears, Can baffle his cares, And a fig for death, or undoing. SONG. V. The Trouper. [1] Come, come, let us drink, 'Tis in vain to think, Like fools on grief or sadness; Let our money fly And our sorrows die, All worldly care is madness; But sack and good cheer Will in spite of our fear, Inspire our souls with gladness. 2 Let the greedy clowns That do live, like hounds, That know neither bound nor measure Lament each loss, For their wealth is their cross, Whose delight is in their treasure, But we that have none, Will use theirs as our own, And spend it at our pleasure. 3 Troul about the bowl, The delight of my soul, And to my hand commend it. A fig for chink 'Twas made to buy drink, Before that we go we'l end it, When we've spent our store, The land will yield us more, And jovially we will spend it. SONG. VI. The Good-fellow. [1] Stay, stay, shut the gates, T'other quart, faith, it is not so late, As you're thinking, Those Stars which you see, In this hemisphere be But the studs in your cheeks by your drinking. The sun is gone to tipple all night in the sea boyes, Tomorrow he'l blush that he's paler then we boyes, Drink wine give him water, 'tis sack makes us the boyes. 2 Fill, fill up the glass To the next merry Lad let it passe Come away w'it; Come set foot to foot, And but give your mindes to't, 'Tis heretical six, that doth slay wit. No helicon like to the juce of the Vine is, For Phæbus had never had wit, or diviness, Had his face not bin bow dy'd as thine, his, &amp; mine is. 4 Drink, drink off your bowls, We'l enrich both our heads and our soules With Canary, A carbuncled face Saves a tedious race, For the Indias about us we carry. Then hang up good faces, we'l drink till our noses, Give freedom to speak what our fancy disposes; Beneath whose protection is under the Roses. 4 This, this must go round, Off your hats, till that the pavement be crown'd, With your beavers A red-coated face Frights a Sergeant at mace, And the Constable trembles to shivers. In state much our face like those of the Quorum, When the wenches fall down &amp; the vulgar adore 'um And our noses, like I inkboyes, inn shining before 'um SONG. VII. The Mock Song by T. J. [1] Hold, hold, quaffe no more, But restore If you can, what you've lost by your drinking, Three Kingdoms and Crownes, With their Citties and Townes, While the King and his progenies sinking. The studs in your cheeks have obscur'd his star boyes Your drinking miscarriages in the late war boyes, Have brought his prerogative now to the bar boyes. 2 Throw, throw down the glasse, He's an Asse That extracts all his worth from Canary, That valour will shrink Thats only good in drink Twas the cup made the camp to miscarry. You thought in the world, there's no power could rame ye You tippled and whor'd till the foe overcame ye, Gods nigs and ne're stir, Sir, has vanquish'd God damm me. 3 Fly, fly from the Coast, Or you're lost, And the water will run where the drink went, From hence you must slink If you have no chink 'Tis the course of the royal delinquent. You love to see beerbowls turn'd over the thumb well You like three fair Gamsters four Dice and a Drum well But you'd as liefe see the devil as Fairfax or Cromwel. 4 Drink, drink not the round You'l be drownd In the source of your sack and your sonnets, Try once more your fate For the King against the State, And go barter your beavers for bonnets. You see how they're charm'd by the Kingdoms inchanters, And therefore pack hence to Virgini for planters, For an act &amp; two Redcoats will rout all the ranters. SONG. VIII. The Answer. [1] Stay, stay, prate no more, Least thy brain, like thy parse run 'th score Though thou strain'st it, Those are Traytors in grain That of sack do complain, And rail by'ts own power against it. Those Kingdoms &amp; Crowns which your poetry pities, Are faln by the pride and hypocrisy of Cities, And not by those brains that love sack &amp; good dities. The K and his progeny had kept 'um from sinking, Had they had no worse foes, then the Lads that love drinking, We that tipple ha'no leisure for plotting or thinking. 2 He, he is an Asse That doth throw down himself with a glass Of Canary He that's quiet will think Much the better of drink, ‘Cause the cups made the camp to miscarry You whore though we tipple, and there my friend you lie, Your sports did determine in the month before July, There's less fraud in plain dam me, then your sly by my truly, 'Tis sack makes our bloods both the purer &amp; warmer We need not your priest or the feminine charmer, For a bowl of Canary's a whole suite of armour. 3 Hold, hold, not so fast, Tipple on, for there is no such hast To be going We drowning may fear, But your end will be there Where there is neither swiming nor rowing? We were Gamsters alike, and our stakes were both down boyes, But Fortune did favour you being her own boyes, And who would not venture a cast for a crown boyes Since we wear the right colours he the worst of our foes is, That goes to traduce us and fondly supposes That Cromwel is an enemy to sack and red noses 4 Then, then quaff it round, No deceit in a brimmer is found, Here's no swearing, Beer and Ale makes you prate Of the Kirk and the State Wanting other discourse worth the hearing This strumpets your Muses, to ballad or flatter Or raile, and your betters with froth to bespatter, And your talk's all diurnals and Gunpowder matter: But we while old sack does divinely inspire us Are active to do what our Rulers acquire us, And attempt such exploits as the world shall admire us. SONG. IX. The Levellers rant. Written in 1648. [1] To the Hall, to the hall, For justice we call, On the King and his pow'rful adherents &amp; friends, Who still have endeavoured, but we work their ends. 'Tis we will pull down what e're is above us, And make them to fear us, that never did love us, We'l level the proud and make every degree, To our Royalty bow the knee, 'Tis no lesse then treason, 'Gainst freedom and Reason For our brethren to be higher then we. 2 First the thing, call'd a King, To judgment we bring, And the spawn of the court, that were prouder then he, And next the two Houses united shall be, It does to the Romish religion enveagle, For the State to be twoheaded like the spread-eagle We'l purge the superfluous members away, They are too many Kings to sway, And as we all teach, 'Tis our Liberties breach, For the Freeborn Saints to obey. 3 Not a Claw, in the Law, Shall keep us in aw; We'l have no cushon-cuffers to tell us of hell, For we are all gifted to do it as well, 'Tis freedom that we do hold forth to the Nations To enjoy our fellow creatures as at the creation The Carnal mens wives are for men of the spirit Their wealth is our own by merit, For we that have right, By the Law called Might Are the Saints that must judge and inherit. SONG. X. The New-Courtier. Written in 1648. [1] Since it must be so, Then so let it go, Let the Giddy-brain'd times turn round, Since we have no King let the goblet be crown'd, Our Monarchy thus we'l recover While the pottles are weeping, we'l drench our sad souls In big-bellyed bowles, Our sorrows in sack shall ly steeping, And we'l drink till our eyes do run over. And prove it by reason That it can be no Treason To drink and to sing A mournival of healths to our new-crown'd King. 2 Let us all stand bare, In the presence we are, Let our noses like bonfires shine, Instead of the Conduits, let the pottles run wine, To perfect this new Coronation, And we that are loyal, In drink, shall be peers. While that face, that wears Pure Claret, lookes like the blood-royal And out-stares the Bores of the Nation, In sign of obedience, Our oathes of allegiance Beer-glasses shall be, And he that tipples ten's of the Nobility. 3 But if in this raign, The Halberted train Or the Constable should rebel, And should make their twybill'd militia to swell, And against the Kings party raise armes, Then the Drawers like Yeomen Of the Guard, with quart-pots, Shall fuddle the sotts, While we make 'um both cukcolds and freemen, And on their wives beat up alarums. Thus as each health passes, We'l tripple the glasses. And hold it no sin, To be loyal and drink in defence of our King. SONG. XI. The Safety. Written in 1648. [1] Since it has been lately enacted high Treason, For a man to speak truth of the heads of the state Let every wise man make use of his reason See and hear what he can, but take heed what he prate. For the proverbs do learn us, He that stayes from the battail sleeps in a whole skin, And our words are our own, if we can keep 'um in, What fools are we then, that to prattle begin Of things that do not concern us? 2 Let the three kingdoms fall to one of the prime ones My mind is a Kingdom and shall be to me, I could make it appear, if I had but the time once, I'm as happy with one, as he can be with three. If I could but injoy it, He that's mounted on high, is a mark for the hate And the envy of every pragmatical pate, While he that creeps low, lives safe in is state, And greatness do scorne to anoy it. 3 I am never the better which side gets the battel, The Tubs or the Crosses what is it to me? They'l never increase my goods or my cattle, But a beggar's a beggar and so he shall be, Unless he turn Traytor, Let Misers take courses to heap up their treasure, Whose lust has no limits, whose mind has no measure Let me be but quiet and take a little pleasure, A little centents my nature. 4 My petition shall be that Canary be cheaper, W'thout patent or custom or cursed excise; That the Wits may have leave to drink deeper and deeper And not be undone, while their heads they baptise And in liquor do drench 'um, If this were but granted, who would not desire, To dub himself one of Appollo's own quire? We'l ring out the bells, when our noses are on fire And the quarts shall be the buckets to drench um. 5 I account him no wit, that is gifted at rayling, And flirting at those that above him do sit, While they do out wit him, with whipping &amp; goaling Then his purse &amp; his person both pay for his wit; 'Tis better to be drinking, If sack were reform'd into Twelvepence a quart, I'ld study for money to merchandize for't, And a friend that is true, we together will sport. Not a word, but we'l pay them with thinking. SONG. XII. The Companion. [1] What need we take care for Platonical rules? Or the precepts of Aristotle? They that think to find learning in books are but fools, True Philosophy lies in the bottle. And a mind That's confind To the mode of the schooles. Nere arrives at the height of a pottle Let the sages Of our ages Keep a talking Of our walking, Demurely, while we that are wiser, Doe abhor all That's moral In Plato And Cato And Seneca talks like a Sizer. Chorus. Then let full bowles on bowles be hurl'd That our jollity may'be completer, For Man though he be but a very little world, Must be drown'd, as well as the greater. 2 We'l drink till our cheeks are as starred as the skies Let the pale-coulour'd students flowt us, And our noses, like Comets, set fire on our eyes, Till we bear the whole heavens about us. And if all Make us fall, Then our heels shall devise VVhat the stars are a doing without us. Let Lilly Go tell you Of thunders And wonders, Let Astrologers all divine, And let Booker Be a looker Of our natures In our features He'l find nothing but Claret in mine. Chorus. Then let full bowles, &amp;c. SONG. XIII. Copernicus. [1] Let the bowl pass free From him to thee As it first came to me, Tis pity that we should confine it, Having all either credit or coyn yet, Let it e'ne take it course, There's no stopping its force He that shuffles must inter-line it. 2 Lay aside your cares, Of Shops and Wares, And irrational fears, Let each breast be as thoughtless as his'n is, That from his bed newly ris'n is, We'l banish each soul, That comes here to condole, Or is troubled with love or businesse. 3 The King we'l not name, Nor a Lady t' enflame, With desire to the game, And into a dumpishnesse drive all, Or make us run mad, and go wive all, We'l have this whole night Set a part for delight And our mirth shall have no corrival. 3 Then see that the Glass Through its circuit do pass; Till it come where it was, And every nose has been within it, Till he end it that first did begin it, As Copernicus found, That the Earth did turn round, We will prove so does every thing in it. SONG. XIV. The Painters entertainment. 1. This is the time, and this is the day Design'd for mirth and sporting, We'l turn October into May, And make St. Lukes feast As pleasant and long as the rest, We'l in our own faces our colours display, And hallow our yearly resorting. Then let the bowles turn round round, While in them our colours we mingle To raise our dull souls from the ground, Our arts and our pains are thus crown'd, And happy are we That in unity be 'Tis a hell upon earth to be single. Chorus. 'Twas love at first that brought us hither, And love shall keep us here together. 2. First to the Master of the feast, This health is consecrated, Thence to each sublimary guest, Whose soul doth desire, This Nectar to raise and inspire, Till he with Apelles himself doth contest, And his fancy is elevated, Then let, &amp;c. Chorus Twas love &amp;c. 3. Lo how the air the earth and the seas, Have all brought in their treasure, To feast each sence with rarities, Plump Bacchus brings wine, And Ceres her dainties doth joyne, The air with rare musick doth eccho and these All club to create us pleasure. Then let the bowles &amp;c. Chorus Twas love, &amp;c. 4. Now in our fancies we will suppose The world in all its glory Imagine all delight that growes, And pleasures that can Fill up the vast soul of a man, And glut the coy pallat the eyes, ears &amp; nose, By the fancy presented before you. Then let the bowles, &amp;c Chorus, 'Twas love &amp;c. 5. We'l use no pencil now but the bowl, Let every artist know it In sack we will pourtray each soul, Each health that is took Will give us the livelyer look, And who's he that dares our fancy controule, When each Painter is turned a poet? Then let the bowles, &amp;c. Chorus, 'Twas love &amp;c. 6. And though we cannot the day extend Beyond its proper measure; The night and it themselves shall blend, We care not for night, When our hearts and our heads are all light, Nor the time, nor the company shall have an end, Honest mirth of it self is a treasure. Then, &amp;c. Chorus, 'Twas love &amp;c. SONG XV. The Cure of Care. [1] Why should we not laugh and be jolly? Since now all the world is mad? All lul'd in a dull melancholly, He that wallows in store, Is still gaping for more; And that makes him as poor, As that wretch that never any thing had. How mad is the dam'nd money-monger, That to purchase to him and his heirs, Growes shrivled with thirst and hunger? While we that are bonny, Buy sack for ready money, And ne're trouble Scriviners nor Lawyers. 2 Those Gulls that by scraping and toyling, Have swell'd the Revenues so vast, Get nothing by all their turmoyling, But are marks for each tax, While they load their own backs, With the heavier packs, And lie down gall'd and weary at last, While we that do trafick in Tipple, Can baffle, the gown and the sword, Whose jawes are so hungry and gripple, We ne're trouble our heads, With indentures or deeds, But our Wills are compris'd in a word. 3 Our money shall never endite us, Nor drag us to Goldsmiths-hall, Nor Pyrates nor storms can affright us, We that have no estates, Pay no taxes or rates, But can sleep with open gates, He that lies on the ground cannot fall, We laugh at those fools whose endeavours Do but fit 'um for prisons or fines, While we that spend all are the savers, For if thieves do steal in, They go out empty agin, Nay the Plunderers lose their designes. 4 Then let's not take care for to morrow, But tipple and laugh while we may, To wash from our hearts all sorrow; Those Cormorants which Are troubled with an itch, To be mighty and rich Do but toyle for the wealth which they borrow. The Mayor of the Town with his ruff on, What a pox is he better then we? He must vail to the men with the buff on He Custard may eat, And such luberly meat, But we drink and are merrier then he. SONG. XVI. Content. Out of Anacrean. [1] If wealth could keep a man alive, I'lld only study how to thrive, That having got a mighty mass, I might bribe the fates to let me passe. But since we can't prolong our years, Why spend we time in needless sighs and tears. For since Destiny Has decreed us to die, And all must passe o're the old ferry Hang riches and cares, Since we ha'nt many years, We'l have a short life and a merry, 3 Times keep their round, and destiny, Observes not where we laugh or cry, And Fortune never does bestow, A look on what we do below: But men with equal swiftness run To prey on others, or be prey'd upon, Since we can take no course, To be better or worse, Let none be a melancholly thinker; Let the Times the round go, So the cups do so too Ne're blush at the name of a Drinker. SONG. XVII. Mirth. Out of Anacreon. When our brains well liquor'd are, Then we charm asleep our care, Then we accompt Machivile a fool with his plots, And cry there's no depth, but the bottom 'oth' pots, Then Hector compar'd with us will be But a coward, and Cræsus beggarly. Then with songs our voice we raise, And circle our Temples with bayes, Then Honour we account but a blast of Wind, And trample all things in our mind. The valiant at arms, That are led by fond charms Get their honour with harms While he that takes up A plentiful cup, To no danger is brought But of paying his groat. Then quickly come Lad and fill our cups full, For since down we must all be laid, 'Tis held a good rule In Bacchus free schole 'Tis better lie drunk then dead. SONG. XVIII. The Independants resolve. Written in 1648. [1] Come drawer and fill us about some wine, Let's merrily tipple the day's our own, We'l have our delights, let the country go pine, Let the King and his Kingdom groan. The Crown is our own and so shall continue, We'l Monarchy baffle quite, We'l drink off the Kingdomes revenue, And sacrifice all to delight. 'Tis power that brings Us all to be Kings And we'l be all crown'd by our might. 2 A fig for divinity lectures and law, And all that to Loyalty do pretend, While we by the sword keep the Kingdom in awe, Our power shall never have end. The Church and the State we'l turn into liquor, And spend a whole Town in a day, We'l melt all their bodkins the quicker Into sack, and drink them away. We'l keep the demeans And turn Bishops and Deans, And over the Presbyter sway. 3 The nimble St. Patrick is sunk in his boggs, And his Country men, sadly cry O hone, O hone! St. Andrew and's Kirk-men are lost in the foggs, Now we are the Saints alone. Thus on our Superiours and Equalls we trample, And Jocky our stirrup shall hold, The Cittie's our Mule for example, That we may in plenty be roul'd. Each delicate dish, Shall but Eccho our wish And our drink shall be cordial gold. SONG. XIX. On Canary. [1] Of all the rare juces, That Bacchus or Cæres produces, There's none that I can, nor dare I Compare with the princely Canary. For this is the thing That a fancy infuses, This first got a King, And next the nine Muses, Twas this made old Poets so sprightly to sing, And fill all the world with the glory &amp; fame on't, They Helicon call'd it and the Thespian spring, But this was the drink, though they knew not the name on't. 2 Our Sider and Perry, May make a man mad but not merry; It makes people windmill-pated, And with crackers sophisticated, And your hopps, yest, and malt, When they're mingled together, Makes our fancies to halt, Or reel any whether. It stuffs up our brains with froth &amp; with yest, That if one would write but a verse for a Belman, He must study till Christmas for an eight shilling jest, These liquors won't raise, but drown, and o'rewhelme man. 3 Our drousy Matheglin Was only ordain'd to enveigle in, The Novice that knowes not to drink yet, But is fudled before he can think it? And your Claret and White, Have a Gunpowder fury, They're of the French spright, But they wont long endure you. And your holiday Muscadine, Allegant and Tent, Have only this property and vertue that's fit in't. They'l make a man sleep till a preacument bespent But we neither can warm our blood nor our wit in't 4 The Bagrag and Rhenish You must with ingredients replenish; 'Tis a wine to please Ladies and ioyes with. But not for a man to rejoyce with. But 'tis Sack makes the sport, And who gains but that flavour, Though an Abbesse he court, In his highshoes he'l have her 'Tis this that advances the drinker and drawer, Though the father came to Town in his hobuails and leather He turns it to velvet, and brings up an Heir, In the Town in his chain, in the field with his feather SONG. XX. The Leveller. [1] Nay prethee don't fly me, But sit thee down by me, I cannot endure A man that's demure Go hang up your worships and Sirs, Your congies and trips, With your legs, and your lips, Your Madams and Lords, And such finikin words, With the complements you bring That do spell NO-THING, You may keep for the chains &amp; the furs For at the beginning was no Peasant or Prince, And 'twas policy made the distinction since. 2 Those Titles of honours Do remain in the Donours. And not in that thing, To which they do cling. If his soul be too narrow to wear 'um, No delight can I see In that word call'd degree, Honest Dick sounds as well As a name of an ell, That with titles doth swell And sounds like a spell, To affright mortal ears that hear 'um. He that wears a brave soul, and dares gallantly do, May be his own herald and Godfather too. 3 Why then should we doat on, One with a fools coat on? Whose Coffers are cram'd, But yet he'l be dam'd. Ere he'l do a good act or a wise one? What Reason has he To be ruler o're me? That's a Lord in his chest, But in's head and his breast Is empty and bare, Or but puff'd up with air, And can neither assist nor advise one. Honour's but air, and proud flesh but dust is, 'Tis we Commons make Lords, and the Clerk makes the Justice. 4 But since men must be Of a different degree, Because most do aspire, To be greater and higher, Then the rest of their fellows &amp; brothers, He that has such a spirit, Let him gain it by's merit, Spend his brain, wealth, or blood For his Countries good, And make himself fit By his valour or wit. For things 'bove the reach of all others. For honour's a prize, and who wins it may wear it, If not 'tis a badge and a burthen to bear it. 5 For my part let me Be but quiet and free, I'le drink sack and obey, And let great ones sway, And spend their whole time in thinking, I'le ne're busy my pate With secrets of State, The news books I'le burn all, And with the Diurnal Light Tobacco, and admit That they're so far fit, As they serve good company &amp; drinking All the name I desire is an honest Good-fellow, And that man has no worth that wont sometimes be mellow. SONG. XXI. The Royalists Answer. [1] I have reason to fly thee, And not sit down by thee; For I hate to behold, One so sawcy and bold, To deride and contemn his superiors, Our Madams and Lords And such mannerly words, With the gestures that be Fit for every degreee, Are things that we and you Both claim as our due From all those that are our inferiours. For from the beginning there were Princes we know, Twas yon Levellers hate 'um 'cause you can't be so. 2 All titles of honours Were at first in the donours; But being granted away With the grantees stay Where he wear a small soul or a bigger. There's a necessitie That there should be degree. VVhere 'tis due we'l afford A Sir John, and my Lord, Though Dick, Tom and Jack, VVill serve you and your pack, Honest Dick's name enough for a Digger. He that has a strong purse can all things be or do, He is valiant and wise and religious too. 3 We have cause to adore, That man that has store, Though a Bore or a sot, There's something to be got; Though he be neither honest nor witty; Make him high, let him rule, He'l be playing the fool, And transgresse, then we'l squeze Him for fines and for fees. And so we shall gain, By the wants of his brain, 'Tis the fools-cap that maintains the Citty. If honour be air, 'tis in common, and as fit, For the fool and the clown, as for the champion or the wit 4 Then why may'nt we be Of different degree? And each man aspire To be greater and higher Then his wiser or honester brother, Since Fortune and Nature Their favours do scatter; This hath valour, that wit, T'other wealth, nor i'st fit That one should have all, For then what would befall Him, that's born nor to one nor to t'other? Though honour were a prize at first, now 'tis a chattle And as merchantable grown as your wares or your cattle 5 Yet in this we agree, To live quiet and free, To drink sack and submit, And not shew our wit By our prating, but silence, and thinking, Let the politick Jew's Read Diurnalls and Newes, And lard their discourse, With a Comment that's worse, That which pleaseth me best Is a song or a Jest, And my obedience I'll shew by my drinking. He that drinks well, does sleep well, he that sleeps well doth think well, He that thinks well, does do well, he that does well, must drink well. SONG. XXII. The safe Estate [1] How happy a man is he, Whose soul is quiet and free, And liveth content with his own! That does not desire To swell nor aspire, To the coronet nor to the crown He doth sit and devise. Those Mushromes that rise, But disturbs not his sleep, At the quoil that they keep, Both in Country and Town, In the plain he sits safe, And doth privately laugh, At high thoughts that are tumbling down. 2 His heart and his head are at rest, And he sleeps with a sorrowlesse brest, That aspires not to sit at the helme, The desires of his mind. To's estate are confin'd, And he lets not his brains to ore'whelme. He's for innocent sport, And keeps off from the court, And if sad thoughts arise, He does only devise With sack to repel 'um. Though the times do turn round, He doth stil keep his ground, Both in a Republique and Realme. 3 He wears his own head and ears, And he tipples in safety with's peers, And harmelesly passeth his time, If he meet with a crosse, A full bowle he doth toss, Nor his wealth, nor his wit are his crime. He doth privately sit With his friend clubbing wit, And disburdning their breasts Of some innocent jests And not higher doth clime. He smiles at the fate Of those Courters of state, That fall down 'cause their thoughts are sublime. 4 But Princes and Nobles are still, Not tenants for life, but at will, And the giddy-brain'd rout is their Lord, He that's crowned to day, A scepter to sway, And by all is obey'd and ador'd. Both he and his crown In a trice are thrown down, For an Act just and good, If mis-understood Or an ill-relish'd word, While he that scorns pelf, And enjoyes his own self, Is secure from the Vote or the Sword. SONG IV. [1] Th' Astrologers, That trade in Starrs, Tell me I have not long to live, Yet do I cry; Lo here am I Let fortune still Do what she will, I'll neither care nor grieve. 2 Fortune I know, Is still my foe, And lets me not grow fat nor thrive, But I, I vow, Will never bow, Nor doat and be As blind as she, But keep my self alive. 3 This I do know, We all must go Though some go sooner, others later, But why so fast? There's no such hast Some post are gone, We'l but jogg on, Bait first, and then walk after. 4 The clown and's beast Make hast to rest, But lords and courtiers sit up longer, Before we part Fill t'other quart, Wash t'other eye, And then we'l try Where death or man be stronger. 5 In th'enterim, Fill to the brim, Travelling will make us weary, Since th' journie's great, And hurts our feet, Bacchus shall be A horse for me He's strong enough to carry. SONG. XIV. The Polititian Written in 1649. [1] What madnesse is't for him that's wise To be so much self-hating? Himself and his to sacrifice, By medling still with things too high, That don't concern but gratifie, His letchery of prating. What is't to us who'se in the ruling power? While thoy protect, we're bound t' obey, But longer not an hower. 2 Nature made all alike at first, But men that fram'd this fidle, Of government made best and worst And high and low, like various strings, Each man his several ditty sings, To tune this state down diddle . In this grand wheel the world we're spokes made all, But that it may still keep its round, Some mount while others fall. 3 The blinded Ruler that by night, Sits with his host of Bill-men With their chalked weapons, that affright The wondring clown that haps to view His worship and his Gowned crew, As if they sate to Kill men. Speak him but fair; he'l frely let you go. And those that on the high rope dance, Will do the same trick too. 4 I'll ne're admire That fatuous fire, That is not what it seems, For those, that now to us seem higher, Like painted bubles blown i'th air, By boyes seem glorious and fair, 'Tis but in boyes esteems. Rule of its self's a toyl and who would bear it But that 'twixt pride and avarice And close revenge they'l share it. 5 Since all the world is but a stage, And every man a player. They're fools that lives or states engage, Let's act and juggle as others do Keep whats our own, get others to, Play whiffler clown or Maior. For he that sticks to what his heart calls just, Becomes a sacrifice and prey To the prosperous whirlegigs lust. 6 Each wise man first best loves himself, Lives close, thinks and obeyes, Makes not his soul a slave to's pelfe. Nor idle squanders it away, To cram their mawes that taxes lay, On what he does, or sayes, For those grand cords that man to man do twist Now are not honesty and love But self and interest. SONG. XXV. The Prisoners Written when O. C. attempted to be King. [1] Come a brimmer (my bullies) drink whole ones or nothing, Now healths have been voted down, 'Tis sack that can heat us, we care not for cloathing, A gallon's as warm as a gown 'Cause the Parliament sees, Nor the former nor these, Could engage us to drink their health, They Vote that we shall Drink no healths at all Nor to King nor to Common-wealth, So that now we must venture to drink 'um by stealth 2 But we've found out a way that's beyond all their thinking, To keep up Good-fellowship still We'l drink their destruction that would destroy drinking, Let 'um Vote that a health if they will. Those men that did fight, And did pray day and night For the Parliament and it's attendant, Did make all that busle, The King out to jusle, And bring in the Independent, But now we all clearly see what was the end on't. 3 Now their Idol's thrown down with their sooterkin also About which they did make such a puther, And though their contrivance made one K. to fall so We have drunk our selves into another. And now (my Lads) we May still Caveliers be, In spite of Committes frown, We will drink, and weel sing, And each health to our King. Shall be Royally drunk in the crown, Which shall be the Standard in every Town. 4 Those politick would bees do but shew themselves asses, That othermens calling invade, We only converse with pots and with glasses, Let the Rulers alone with their trade. The Lyon of the Tower, Their estates does devour, Without shewing law for't or reason, Into prison we get, For the crime called debt, Where our Bodies and brains we do season And that is ne're taken for murther or treason. 5 Where our ditties still be give's more drink, gives more drink boyes, Let those that are frugal take care, Our Goalers and we will live by our chink boyes, While our Creditours live by the air. Here we lie at our ease, And get craft and grease, Till we've merrily spent all our store, Then as drink brought us in, 'Twill redeem us agen, We got in because we were poor, And swear our selves out on the very same score SONG. XXVI. Satisfaction. [1.] I have often heard men say, That the Philosophers of old, Though they were good and grave &amp; gray Did various opinions hold, And with idolatry adore The Gods that themselves had made before, And we that are fools do do no more. 2. Every man desires what's good; But wherein that good consists Is not by any understood. This sets on work both pens and fist, For this condemns what that approves, And this man doth hate, what that man loves, And thats the grand rule that discord moves. 3. This would valiant be, that wise, That's for th' sea, and this for land, All do judge upon surmise, None do rightly understand, These may be like, but are not that, Something there is that all drive at, But only they differ about the WHAT. 4. And from all these several ends Springs diversity of actions, For every man his studies bends, As opinion builds his faction Each man's his own God-smith, what he Thinks good, is good to him, and we First make, then adore our deity. 5. A mind that's honest, pure and just A sociable life and free, A friend that dares not break a trust, Yet dares die if occasion be, A heart that dictates to the tongue, A soul that's innocent and strong. That can yet, will not do any wrong. He that has such a soul and a mind, That is so blest and so inclind, What all these do seek for, he does find. SONG XVXII. The Club. [1] Prithee ben't so sad and serious, Nothing got by grief or care, Melancholy's too imperious, Where it comes 'twil domineer, If thou hast a cloudy breast, In which thy cares would build a nest Then drink good sack, 'twill make the rest, Where sorrows come not near. 2 Be it businesse love, or sorrow, That possesses thus thy mind, Bid them come again to morrow We are now to mirth inclin'd, Fill thy cup and drown them all, Sorrows still do for liquor call, We'l make this Bacchus festival And cast our cares behind. 3 He that has a hearts that's drowsy Shall be surely banished hence; We'l shun him as a man that's lowsy, He's of dangerous consequence, And he that's silent like a block, Deserves to be made a laughingstock, Let all good fellows shun that rock, For fear they forfeit sence, 4 Still those clocks let time attend us, We'l not be to howers consind, We'l banish all that may offend us, Or disturb our mirth design'd, Let the glasse still run its round And each good-fellow keep his ground And if there be any flincher found, We'l have his soul new coyn'd. SONG. XXVIII. The Prodigal. [1] Nay perswade not, I've swore We'l have one pottle more, Though we run on the score, And our credits do stretch for't, To what end does a father, Pine his body, or rather, Damne his soul for to gather Such store, but that he has this fetch fort, That we sons should be high boyes, And make it all fly boyes And when he does dye boyes Instead of a Sermon we'l sing him a catch for't. 2 Then hang the Dull wit Of that white-liverd cit, That good fellows does hit In teeth with a rednose, May his nose look blew Or any dreadfuller hue, That may speak him untrue, And disloyal unto the headnose, 'Tis the scarlet that graces, And sets out our faces, And that nature base is, That esteems not a Coppernose more then a leadnose. 3 All the world keeps around, First our fathers abound In wealth and buy ground, And then leave it behind 'um We're straight put in black, Where we mourne and drink sack, And do tother knack. While they sleep in their graves we ne're mind 'um, Thus we scatter the store, As they rack'd it before And as for the poor, We enrich them as fast as our father did grind them. SONG. XXIX. The Antipolititian. [1] Come leave thy care and love thy friend, Live freely don't dispair, Of getting money there's no end, And keeping it breeds care. If thou hast money at thy need Good Company and good wine, His life, whose joyes on wealth do feed, 's no half so sweet as thine. 2 I can enjoy my self and friends, W'thout design or fear, Below their envy or base ends, That Polititians are. I neither toyle nor care nor grieve To gather keep or loose; With freedom and consent I live, And what's my own I use. 3 While men blown on with strong desires Of riches or renown, Though ne're so high, would still be higher So tumble headlong down. For Princes smiles turne oft to frowns, And favours fade each hower, He that to day heaps Townes on Townes, To morrow's clap't ith Tower. 4 All that we get by all our store, 's but honour or dominion, The one's but trouble varnish do're And 'tothers but opinion. Fate rules the roast, Times alwayes change, 'Tis fancy builds all things, How madly then our minds do range, Since all we grasp hath wings. 5 Those empty terms of rich and poor, Comparison hath fram'd, He hath not much that covets more. VVant is but will nicknam'd. If I can safely think and live, And freely laugh or sing, My wealth I'll not for Cræsus give, Nor change lives with a King. SONG. XXX. The New Gentry. [1] Enough for shame! leave off this fooling, Prithee cring no more Nor admire the illgotten store Of the upstart Mushromes of our Nation VVith blind and groundlesse adoration, If thy nature still wants schooling. As thou dost grow old grow wise, For age can easily advise, And make thee know 'Tis only such as thou. That bring and keep both fools &amp; knaves in fashion 2 We make each other proud and knavish, For where ever we Great abundance chance to see There we fling both power and honour As if wealth where the only donour, And our natures are so slavish. That we tamely will submit, All our reason strength and wit, And pay and pray, Great men in power, that they Will take our Liberty and trample on her. 3 What is't makes all men so much covet, Toyling more and more, To increase a needless store, So violently tugg and hall for't Ventering body soul and all fort? The rich are flatter'd and they love it We obey their shalls and musts, And to gratifie their lusts, We madly strive VVho first our selves shall give And all that is ours to them, if they'l but call for't. 4 If we did take no notice of them, Like not, nor applaud, Their spoyles obtaind by force &amp; fraud But would live content and jolly Laughing at their painful folly, And would neither fear nor love them, Underneath their loads, they'ld groan, Or with shame would throw them down, And live as free From needlesse cares as we, Slight pompe and wealth, that makes men melancholly 5 Pray what are all these gaudy bubbles That so boast and rant, Of what they think they have, but hant? But men that had the luck of living, And made others fall their thriving, Hailstones got in stormes of troubles. That for valour are as fit, For Knights, as to be Squires for wit Inspired with pride, Did what good men defied, Grown great by Protean turning and conniving. 6 That man that would have me adore him, With my heart, he must Be noble, pow'rful, wise and just, And improve his parts and power To support not to devour, Nor pride nor lust, must e're rule o're him Th' bugbeare greatnesse without this An idle, empty pageant is, He that doth rise And is not good and wise, I honour not, but pity and deplore him. SONG. XXXI. The Cheerful heart. [1] What though these ill times do go cross to our will? And fortune still frowns upon us, Our hearts are our own, and they shall be so still, A pin for the plagues they lay on us. Let us take t'other cup, To keep our hearts up, And let it be purest Canary, We'l ne're shrink or care, For the crosses we bear, Let 'um plague us untill they be weary. 2 What though we are made, both beggars and slaves, Let us stoutly endure it and drink on. Tis our comfort we suffer, cause we will not be knaves Our redemption will come e're we think on't. We must flatter and fear Those that over us are, And make 'um believe that we love 'um, When their tyrannies past, We will serve them at last, As they serv'd those that have been above um. 3 The Levites do preach, for the goose and the pig, To drink wine but at Christmas and Easter, The Doctour doth labour our lives to new-trig, And makes nature to fast, but we feast her, The Lawyer doth bawle, Out his lungs and his gaule, For the Plantiff and for the Defendant; At books the Scholar lies Till by Flatus he dies, With the ugly hard word at the end on't 4 But here's to the man that delights in Sol fa, 'Tis sack is his only Rosin, A load of heigh ho's are not worth a ha, ha, He's the man for my money that draws in. Come a pin for this Muck, And a fig of ill Luck, 'Tis better be blyth and frolick, Then to sigh out our breath, And invite our own death By the Gout or the stone, and the cholick. SONG. XXX. The Answer to the Curse against Ale. [1] O gag for shame that strumpet muse! Let not her Spanish tongue abuse, Our wholsome and Heroic English juice. 2 'Twas not this loyal liquor shut Our Gates against our Soveraign, but Strange drink into one tub together put. 3 When Ale was drink Canonical There were no thieves, nor watch, nor wall, Men neither stole, nor lack'd, for Ale was all. 4 That Poet ought be dry or dumb, And to our brown-bowles never come, Who drinking Ale, vents only drugs and scum. 5 Nor had that Souldier drunk enough, For Ale both valour gives and buffe, Makes men unkickable, and cudgel-proof. 6 'Twas the meal not mealman was the cause, The mill fell down, for one small clause In one meal-act, hath overthrown our lawes. 7 The worth of Ale none can proclaim, But by th' assistance of the same, From it our Land derives it noblest name. 8 With this men were inspir'd, but not As kickshaw brains are now (God wot) Inspir'd, that is, run mad, none knowes with what. 9 How did our stout forefathers make, All Antichristian Nations quake, When they their Nutbrown bowles and bills did take! 10 What noble sparks old Ale did kindle! But now strange drinks do make men dwindle, And Pigmies get, scarce fit to sway a spindle. 11 This liquor makes the drinkers fight Stoutly, while others stoutly write: This both creates the Poet and the Knight. 12 This makes the drawer in his Gown And chain to ride and rule the Town, Whose orient Nose exemplifies his frown. 13 How reverently the burly Host With basket hilted pot and tost, Commands the bak't meats, and then rules the rost; 14 But oh the Brewer bears the bell! This makes him to such highnesse swell, As none but Ale-inspir'd can think or tell. 15 Divert that curse then, or give o're, Don Phillip can hurt Ale no more, Then his Armado, England heretofore. SONG. XXXIII. The Reformation. [1] Tell not me of Lords or Lawes, Rules or Reformation, All that's done's not worth two strawes, To the welfare of the Nation. Men in power do rant it still, And give no reason but their will, For all their domination. Or if they do an act that's just, 'Tis not because they would, but must, To Gratifie some parties lust, Or meerly for a fashion. 2 Our expence of blood and purse. Has produc'd no profit. Men are still as bad or worse, And will be what e're comes of it. We've shuffled out, and shuffled in, The persons, but retain the sin, To make our game the surer, Yet spite of all our pains and skill, The knaves all in the pack are still, And ever were and ever will, Though something now demurer. 3 And it cannot but but be so, Since those toys in fashion, And of souls so base and low, And mere Bigots of the Nation, Whose designs are power and wealth At which by rapines, fraud and stealth Audaciously they vent'r ye, They lay their consciences aside, And turn with every wind and tide, Puff'd on by Ignorance and pride, And all to look like Gentry. 4 Crimes are not punish'd cause they'r crimes But 'cause they'r low and little, Mean men for mean faults in these times Make satisfaction to a title; While those in office and in power, Boldly the underlings devour. Our Cobweb lawes can't hold 'um. They sell for many a Thousand crown, Things which were never yet their own, And this is law and custom grown, Cause those do judg that sold 'um. 5 Brothers still with Brothers brawl, And for trifles sue 'um, For two pronouns that spoil all, Those contentious Meum, Tuum, The wary lawyer buyes and builds, While the Client sells his fields, To sacrifice to's fury; And when he thinks to obtain his right He's baffled off, or beaten quite, By th' Judges will or Lawyers slight, Or ignorance of the Jury. 6 See the trades-man how he thrives With perpetual trouble, How he cheats, and how he strives His Estate t'enlarge and double, Extort, oppresse, grind and encroach, To be a Squire, and keep a coach, And to be one o'th Quorum, Who may with's brother worships sit, And judge without law, fear or wit, Poor petty thieves that nothing get, And yet are brought before 'um. 7 And his way to get all this Is mere dissimulation, No factious lecture does he miss, And scapes no schism that's in fashion. But with short hair and shining shoes, He with two pens, and's note-book goes, And winks and writes at randome; Thence with short meal and tedious Grace, In a loud tone and publick place, Sings Wisdoms hymns, that trot and pace, As if Goliah scand 'um. 8 But when death begins his threats, And his Conscience struggles, To call to mind his former cheats Then at heav'n he turns his juggles. And out of all's ill-gotten store, He gives a dribling to the poor, In a Hospital or a School-house, And the suborned Priest for's hire, Quite frees him from th' infernal fire And places him it'h Angels quire, Thus these Jack-puddings fool us. 9 All he gets by's pains i'th close, Is that he dyed worth so-much, Which he on's doubtful seed bestows, That neither care nor know much, Then fortunes favorite his heir, Bred base, and ignorant and bare, Is blown up like a bubble, Who wondring at's own suddain rise, By pride simplicity and vice, Falls to's sports, drink, drab and dice And makes all fly like stubble. 10 And the Church the other twin, Whose mad zeal enrag'd us, Is not purifi'd a pin, By all those broyles in which she engag'd us, We, our wives turn'd out of doors, And took in Concubines and whores, To make an alteration. Our Pulpiteers are proud and bold, They their own Wills and factions hold, And sell salvation still for Gold, And here's our Reformation. 11 'Tis a madness then to make, Thriving our employment, And lucre love, for Lucres sake, Since we've possession, not injoyment. Let the times run on their course, For opposition makes them worse, We ne're shall better find 'um, Let Grandees wealth and power engrosse, And honour too, while we sit close, And laugh and take our plenteous dose, Of sack and never mind 'um. SONG. XXXIV. For the Generalls entertainment. [1] Farewell all cares and fears, let Gladnesse come, Let's all strive which shall most rejoyce, No more the Trumpet, or the Thundring Drum, Shall interrupt our peace with noise, But all their Offices shall be Inherited by sprightly melody. Th' inchanting Lute and the melodious Lyre, With well-tun'd souls does make a full harmonious Quire. 2 In vain do we our selves, our selves destroy, In vain do English, English beat, Contests are cruel, we must now wear joy, And all in love, each other greet. Our civil discords now shall cease, And lose themselves in a desired peace. All things by war are in a Chaos hurl'd, But love alone first made, and still preserves the World. 3 The Trophies of the Conquerours of old, And all the spoils with which they'r crown'd, Were all but types of what we do behold, What they did seek for, we have found. Here peace and plenty sweetly kist, And both with loyalty &amp; vertue twist, Then let our joy rise high that all may share it, Let wealth and honour meet desert, he that wins Gold may wear it. SONG. XXXV. On Sir G. B. his defeat. [1] Pray why should any man complain, Or why disturb his brest or brain, At this new alteration? Since that which has been done's no more, Then what has been done before, And that which will be done agen, As long's there are ambitious men, That strive for domination. 2 In this mad age there's nothing firm, All things have periods and their terme, Their Rise and Declinations, Those gaudy Nothings we admire, Which get above, and shine like fire, Are empty vapours, rais'd from dust, Whose mock-shine past, they quickly must Fall down like Exhalations. 3 But still we Commons must be made A gald, a lame, thin, hackney jade, And all by turnes will ride us, This side and that, no matter which, For both do ride with spur and switch, Till we are tyr'd, and then at last, We stumble, and our riders cast Cause they'ld nor feed nor guide us. 4 The insulting Clergy quite mistook, In thinking Kingdoms past by book, Or Crowns were got by prating; 'Tis not the blackcoat, but the red Has power to make, or be the head, Nor is it words, or oaths, or tears, But Muskets or full Bandoleers Have power of Legislating. 5 The Lawyers must lay by their book, And study Lambert more then Cook, The sword's the learnedst pleader, Reports and judgments will not do't, But 'tis Dragoons, and Horse and foot, Words are but wind, but blowes come home, A stout tongu'd Lawyer's but a Mome, Compar'd to a stout File-leader. 6 Luck, wit or valour, rule all things, They pull down and they set up Kings, All lawes are in their bosome; That side is always right that's strong, And that that's beaten must be wrong, An he that thinks it is not so, Unlesse he's sure to beat 'um too, Is but a fool t'oppose 'um. 7 Let them impose taxes or rates, 'Tis but on those that have estates, Not such as I and thou are, But it concerns those worldlings, which Are left, or made, or else grow rich, Such as have studied all their dayes, The saving and the thriving wayes, To be the mules of power. 8 If they reform the Church or State, We'l ne're be troubled much thereat, Let each man takes opinion, If we don't like the Church you know, Taverns are free and there we go, And if every one would be As cleerly unconcern'd as we, They'd ne're fight for Dominion. SONG. XXXVI. Against Corrupted Sack. [1] Sack! once my comfort and my dear delight, Dull mortals quickning spirit; Thou didst once give affections, wit, and might, Thou mad'st the Lover and the Wight, Thou mad'st one dye, and t'other fight, Thou mad'st the Poet, who made both, and thou Inspird'st our brains with genial fire till now Th' hast justly lost thy honour Cause th'hast lost thy power and merit. 2 Now we depose thee from th'usurped throne, Since thou'rt degenerate and disloyall; Thou hast no proper father of thine own, But art a bastard got by th' Town By Æquivoke generation, Thy Bawds, the Vintners do compound thee more, Then Flavel or Besse Beer ere drudg'd a whore, Nor canst thou now inspire nor feed, Nor cherish; but destroy all. 3 Oh where's that sprightly Poetry and Wit, That should endure for ever? Had Homer drank thy mixture, he had writ Lines that would make the Reader spit, Nor beyond puns would Pindar get, Virgil and Horace if inspir'd by thee, Had writ but leud and pagan poetry. Dull dropsy'd lines, or else as dry and raging as a fever. 4 Treasons committed and contriv'd by thee, Kingdoms and Kings subverted, 'Tis thou makest Rulers fools &amp; cowards bee, And such as ought to bend the Knee Madly invade the Soveraignty, Thou throwst us on all actions, vile &amp; fell First mak'st us do, and then thou makest us tell, And whom we swore to serve, By thee we basely have deserted. 5 Thou plague of bodies and th' unnatural Nurse. Of Sicknesse and Physitians Ruine of wit, and strength, and fame, and purse, That hast destroy'd poor mortals worse Then the great plague, or Merosh curse. In fifty nine th'hast spilt more English blood Then e're in eighty eight the Spaniard could By his Armndo or can since destroy By's inquisitions. 6 Hence from my veins, from my desires be gone I loath thee and defie thee, I'le now find out a purer Helicon, Which wits may safely feast upon, And baffle thy hobgoblin Don. And live to see thee and thy mungrel race Contemn'd and rooted out of every place, And those thou'st fool'd and wrong'd like me, For ever ever fly thee. SONG XXXVII. The Lamentation. Written in 1648. [1] Mourne, London, mourne, Bathe thy polluted soul in tears; Returne, returne, Thou hast more cause of grief, then th'hadst for fears, For the whole Kingdom now begins To feel thy sorrows as they saw thy sins, And now do no Compassion show Unto thy misery and wo, But flight thy sufferings as thou didst theirs. 2 Pride towring pride, And boyling lust, those fatal twins, Sit side by side, And are become plantations of sins. Hence thy Rebellions first did flow, Both to the King above, and him below. And sordid sloth The Nurse of both, Have rais'd thy crimes to such a growth, That sorrow must conclude as sin begins. 3 Fire raging fire, Shall burn thy stately towers down, Yet not expire, Tygres and Wolves, or men more savage grown, Thy childrens brains, and thine shall dash, And in your blood their guilty tallons wash, Thy Daughters must Allay their lust, Mischiefs will be on mischief thrust, Till thy Cap tumble as thou mad'st the Crown. 4 Cry London cry! Now now petition for redresse, Where canst thou fly? Thy emptyed chests augment thy heavinesse, The Gentry and the Commons loath, Th' adored Houses slight the worse then both, The King poor saint, Would help but can't; To heav'n alone unfold thy want Thence came thy plagues, thence only pity flow'th SONG XXXVIII. The Riddle. Written in 1644. [1] No more, no more, We are already pin'd, And sore and poor, In body and in mind. And yet our sufferings have been Lesse then our sin. Come long-desired peace we thee implore, And let our pains be lesse, or power more. 2 Lament, Lament, And let thy tears, run down, To see the rent Between the Robe and Crown, Yet both do strive to make it more Then 'twas before, War like a serpent has its head got in, And will not end so soon as't did begin. 3 One body Jars, And with its self does fight, War meets with warrs And might resisteth might. And both sides say they love the King, And peace will bring. Yet since these fatal civill broyls begun, Strange Riddle! both have conquer'd, neither won. 4 One God, one King, One true Religion still, In every thing One Law both should fulfil, All these both sides does still pretend That they defend. Yet to encrease the King and Kingdoms woes, Which side soever wins good subjects lose. 5 The King doth swear, That he doth fight for them; And they declare, They do the like for him: Both say they wish and fight for peace, Yet wars increase. So between both, before our wars be gone, Our lives and goods are lost, and we're undone. 6 Since 'tis our curse. To fight we know not why; 'Tis worse and worse The longer thus we ly. For war it self is but a Nurse To make us worse. Come blessed peace we once again implore, And let our pains be lesse, or power more. SONG. XXXIX. On the Kings returne. [1.] Long have we waited for a happy End Of all our miseries and strife; But still in vain the Swordmen did intend, To make them hold for tearm of Life. That our distempers might be made, Their everlasting lively-hood and trade. 2. They entayle their Swords and Guns, And pay, which wounded more; Upon their Daughters and their Sons, Thereby to keep us ever poor. 3. And when the Civil wars were past They civil Government envade; To make our taxes, and our slavery last, Both to their titles, and their trade. 4. But now we are redeem'd from all, By our Indulgent King; Whose coming does prevent our fall, With loyal and with joyful hearts we'l sing. Chorus. Welcome, welcome royal May, Welcome long desired Spring, Many springs and Mays we've seen Have brought forth what's gay and green. But none is like this glorious day Which brings forth our Gracious King. SONG. XL. A Catch. Let's leave off our labour, and now let's go play, For this is our time to be jolly; Our plagues and our plaguers are both fled away, To nourish our griefs is but folly. He that won't drink and sing, Is a Traytor to's King. And so's he that does not look twenty years younger We'l look blith and trim, With rejoycing at him That is the restorer, and will be the Prolonger, Of all our felicity and health, The joy of our hearts, &amp; increase of our wealth, 'Tis he brings our trading, our trading brings riches, Our riches brings honors, at which every mind itches, And our riches bring sack, &amp; our sack brings us joy, And our joy makes us leap, and sing Vive le Roy. SONG XLI. For General Monk his entertainment at Cloath-workers Hall. [1.] Ring Bells! and let bone-fiers out blaze the sun! Let ecchoes contribute their voice! Since now a happy settlement's begun, Let all things tell how all good men rejoyce. If these sad Lands by this Can but obtain the blisse Of their desired, though abused peace; We'l never never more Run mad as we've heretofore To buy our ruine; but all strife shall cease. 2. The Cobler shall edifie us no more, Nor shall in divinity set any stiches, The women we will no more hear &amp; adore That preach with their husbands for the breeches. The Fanatical tribe That will not subscribe, To the orders of Church and of State, Shall be smother'd with the zeal Of their new common-weale And no man will mind what they prate. Chorus. We'l eat, and we'l drink, we'l dance and we'l sing, The Roundheads &amp; Cave's no more shall be nam'd; But all joyn together to make up the ring, And rejoyce that the many headed dragon is tam'd. 'Tis friendship and love, that can save us and arme us, And while we all agree, their is nothing can harme us SONG. XLII. The Advice. [1] He that a happy life would lead, In these dayes of distraction, Let him listen to me, and I will read A lecture without faction. Let him want three things, Whence misery springs All which do begin with a letter; Let him bound his desires, With what nature requires, And with reason his humours fetter. 2 Let not his Wealth prodigious grow, For that breeds cares and dangers, Makes him hated above and envyed below, And a constant slave to strangers. He is happiest of all, Whose estate is but small, Yet enough to delight and maintain him. He may do, they may say, Having nothing to pay, It will not quit costs to arraign him. 3 Nor must he be clogg'd with a Wife. For household cares incumber, And do to one place confine a mans life, 'Cause he cant remove his lumber. They're happiest by farr, Who unweddy'd are, And forrage on all in common, From all storms they can fly, And if they should dy, They ruine nor child nor woman. 4 Nor let his brains o'reflow with Wit, That capers o're's discretion; 'Tis costly to keep, and 'tis hard to get And 'tis dangerous in the possession. They are happiest men Who can scarce tell ten, And beat not their brains about reason, They may speak what will serve, Themselves to preserve, And their words are ne're taken for treason. 5 But of all fools there is none like the Wit, For he takes pains to shew it, When his pride, or his drink work him into a fit, Then straight he must be a Poet. Then his Jests he flings, Both at States and at Kings, For Applause and for Bayes and Shadowes. Thinks a verse saves as well As a circle or a spell, 'Till he drives himself to the Barbadoes. 6 He that within these bounds can live, May baffle all disasters, To Fortune and Fates commands he may give Which worldlings make their masters. He may sing, he may laugh, He may dance, he may quaffe, May be mad, may be sad, may be jolly, He may sleep without care, And wake without fear And laugh at the whole world, and its folly. BALLADS. I. The Satyr of Money [1] It is not the Silver or gold of its self, That makes men adore it; but 'tis for its power: For no man does dote upon pelf, because pelf, But all court the Lady in hopes of her Dower. The wonders that now in our dayes we behold, Done by th' irresistible power of Gold, Our Love, and our Zeal, and Allegiance do mold. 2 This purchaseth Kingdoms, Kings, Scepters, &amp; Crowns, Wins Battles, and conquers the Conquerours bold; Takes Bulwarks, and Castles, and Armies, and Towns, Our prime Lawes are written in letters of Gold. 'Tis this that our Parliaments calls, and creates, Turns Kings into Keepers, and Kingdoms to States, And Peopledoms this into High-doms translates. 3 This plots doth devise, then discovers what th' are, This makes the great felons the lesser condemn: Sets those on the bench that should stand at the bar, Who judge such as by right ought to execute them: Gives the boystrous Clown his unsufferable pride, Makes Beggars, and fools, and Usurpers to ride, While ruin'd properties run by their side. 4 Stamp either the arms of the State, or the King St. George or the breeches C. R. or O. P. The Crosse and the fiddle 'tis all the same thing. This still is the Queen who e're the King be. This lines mens Religion, builds doctrines &amp; truth, With zeal, and the spirit, the factious endew'th, To club with St. Katherine or sweet sister Ruth. 5 This made our black Senate to sit still so long, To make themselves rich by making us poor; This made our bold Army so daring, and strong, And that made them drive 'um like Geese out of door. 'Twas this made the Covenant-makers to make it, And this made our Levites to make us to take it, And this made both makers and takers forsake it. 6 This spawn'd the dunghil crew of Committes and 'Strators, Who lived by picking their Parliaments Gums, This made and then prospered Rebels and Traytors, And made Gentry of those that were the Nations scums. This Herald gives armes, not for merit but store, Gives Coates unto such, as did sell coates before, If their pockets be lin'd but with Argent and Oare. 7 'Tis this makes the Lawyer give judgment and plead, On this side, or that side, on both sides or neither, This makes Yeomen Clerks, that can scarce write or read, And spawns arbitrary orders as various as the weather: This make the blew-lecturer pray, preach, and prate Without reason or truth against K. church or State, To shew the thin lyning of his twice-cover'd pate. 8 'Tis this that makes Earls, Lords, Knights, &amp; Esqiures; Without breeding, discent, wit, learning or merit; Makes Ropers and Ale-drapers Sheriffs of Shires, Whose trade's not so low nor so base as their spirit: This Justices makes, and wise ones we know, Furr'd Al dermen likewise, and Mayors also, Makes the old wife to trot, and makes the Mare go. 9 This makes the blew aprons write themselves worshipful, And for this we stand bare and before 'um do fall; They leave their young Heirs well fleeced with wool, Whom we're to call Squires, and they're to pay all, Who with beggarly souls, though their bodies are gawdy, Court the pale Chambermaid &amp; nickname her a Lady, And for want of discourse they do swear and talk bandy. 10 For money mens lives may be purchas'd and sold, 'Tis money breaks laws &amp; that mends 'um again; Men venture their quiet and safety for gold, When they wont stir a foot their rights to maintain. This Doctors createth of Dunces, and those, Commanders that use to pollute their hose, This buys the spruce gallant his verse and his prose. 11 This marriages makes, 'tis the center of love, It drawes on the man &amp; it pricks up the woman; Birth, virtue, and parts, no affection can move, While this makes Lords bow to the brat of a Broom-man. Gives vertue, and beauty to the lass that you woe, Makes women of all sorts and ages to do; 'Tis the soul of world, and the worldling too. 12 This horses procures you, and hawks, hounds &amp; hares, 'Tis this keeps your Groom, and your Groom keeps your Gelding; It buys Citizens wives as well as their wares, And makes your coy Ladies so coming &amp; yielding This buys us good sack, which revives like the spring, This gives the poetical fancies their wing, This makes you as merry as we that do sing. II. Upon a Sign-Post, set up by one Mr. Pecke at Skoale in Norfolk. [1] Did none of you hear, Of a wonder last year, That through all Norfolk did ring; Of an Inn and an Host, With a Sign and a post That might hold (God bless us) the King. 2 The building is great And very compleat, But can't be compard to the signe; But within doors, I think 'scarse a drop of good drink, For Bacchus drinks all the best wine. 3 But here's the design What's a misse in the Wine, By wenches shall be supply'd; There's three on a row Stands out for a show, To draw in the Gallants that ride. 4 The first of the three, Diana should be, But she cuckolded poor Actæon, And his head she adorns, With such visible horns, That he's fit for his hounds for to prey on. 5 'Tis unsafe we do find To trust Women kind, Since horning's a part of their trade Diana is plac't As a Goddesse that's chast, Yet Actæon a Monster she made. 6 The next wench doth stand, With the scales in her hand And is ready to come at your beck; A new trick they've found, To sell sack by the pound, But 'twere better they'd sell't by the peck. 7 The last of the three They say prudence must be With the serpent and horn of plenty; But plenty and wit So seldom doth hit, That they fall not to one in twenty. 8 But above these things all, Stands a fellow that's small, With a Quadrant discerning the wind, And say hee's a fool That travells from Skoale, And leave his good liquor behind. 9 Nere the top of the sign, Stand three on a line, One is Temperance, still powring out; And Fortitude will Drink what Temperance fill, And fears not the stone or the gout. 10 The next to these three You'l an Usurer see, With a prodigal child in his mouth; 'Tis Time (as some say) And well so it may For they be devourers both. 11 The last that you stare on Is old father Charon Who's wafting a wench o're the ferry, Where Cerberus do's stand To watch where they land, And together they go to be merry. 12 Now to see such a change Is a thing that is strange That one who as stories do tell us; His money has lent At fifty per cent A Colledg should build for goodfellows 13 But under this work Do's a mistery lurk, That shewes us the founders design, He has chalk'd out the way For Gallants to stray, That their lands may be his in fine. 14 That's first an Ale bench, Next hounds then a wench, With these three to roar and to revel; Brings the prodigals lands, To the Usurers hands And his body and soul to the Devil. 15 Now if you would know After all this adoe, By what name, this sign should be known, Some call't this, &amp; some that, And some I know not what, But 'tis many signs in one. 16 Ti's a sign that who built it Had more money then wit, And more wealth then he got or can use, 'Tis a sign that all we Have lesse wit then he That go thither to drink and may chuse. III. A new Diurnal of passages more Exactly drawn up then heretofore. Printed and published; 'tis order'd to be By Henry Elsing the Clerk of the P. 1. June. 1643. Since many Diurnals (for which we are griev'd, Are come from both Houses, and are not believ'd; The better to help them for running and flying, We have put them in Verse, to Authorize their lying. For it has been debated, and found to be true, That lying's a Parliament Priviledge too: And that they may the sooner our conquests reherse, We are minded to put them in Galloping verse; But so many Maim'd Souldiers from Reading there came, That in spite of the Surgeons, make our verses go lame. We have ever us'd Fictions, and now it is known, Our Poverty has made us Poetical grown. Munday. On Munday both Houses fell into debate, And were likely to fall by the ears as they sate; Yet would they not have the business decided, That they (as the Kingdom is) might be divided. They had an intention to Prayers to go, But Extempore Prayers are now Common too. To Voting they fall; and the key of the work, Was the raising of mony for the State and the Kirke. 'Tis only Free-loan: yet this order they make, That what Men would not lend, they should Plunder and take, Upon this, the word Plunder came into their minds, And all of them did labour a new one to find. They call'd it distraining: yet thought it no shame, To persist in the Act, which they blush't for to name. They Voted all Persons from Oxford that came, Should be apprehended: and after the same, With an Humble Petition, the King they request, Hee'd be pleas'd to return, and be serv'd like the rest. A message from Oxford conducing to peace, Came next to their hands, that Armes might cease. They Voted and Voted, and still they did vary, Till at last the whole sence of the House was contrary To reason; they knew by their Armes they might gain, What neither true reason, nor Law can maintain. Cessation was voted a dangerous plot; Because the King would have it, both Houses would not. But when they resolv'd it, abroad must be blown, (To baffle the World) that the King would have none. And carefully muzled the mouth of the press, Least the truth should peep through their jugling dress. For they knew a cessation would work them more harmes, Then Essex could do the Cavaliers with his armes. While they keep the Ships and the Forts in their hand, They may be Traytors by Sea as well as by Land. The Forts will preserve them as long as they stay, And the Ships carry them and their plunder away. They have therefore good reason to account war the better, For the Law will prove to them but a killing letter. Tuseday. A Post from his Excellence came blowing his Horn, For mony to advance, and this spun out the Morn; And strait to the City some went for reliefe, The rest made an Ordinance to carry Powder-Beefe. Thus up go the Round-Heads, and Essex advances, But only to lead his Souldiers new dances. To Reading he goes, for at Oxford (they say) His wife has made Bull works to keep him away. Prince Rupert, for fear that the name be confounded, Will saw off his horns, and make him a Round-head. The newes was returned with General fame, That Reading was taken ere ever he came. Then away Rode our Captains, and Souldiers did run, To shew themselves valiant, when the Battail was done, Preparing to plunder, but as soon as they came, They quickly perceived it was but a flam: An Ordinance of Parliament Essex brought down, But that would not serve him to batter the Town. More mony was rais'd, more Men and Ammunition, Carts loaded with Turnips, and other provision. His Excellence had Chines and Rams-heads for a present, And his Councel of War had Woodcock and Pheasant. But Ven had 5000. Calves heads all in carts, To nourish his Men and to chear up their hearts. This made them so valiant that that very day, They had taken the Town but for running away. 'Twas Ordered this day, that thanksgiving be made, To the Round-heads in Sermons, for their beefe and their bread. Wednesday. Two Members this day at a Conference sate, And one gives the other a knock on the pate. This set them a voting, and the upper house swore, Twas a breach of priviledge he gave him no more. The lower the breaking their Members head voted A breach of their priviledge; for it is to be noted, That reason and Priviledge in it did grow, Twas a breach of his Crown and dignity too. Then came in the Women with a long long petition, To settle Militia and damn the Commission. For if fighting continue, they say they did fear, That Men would be scarce, and Husbands be dear. So plainly the Speaker the business unties, That presently all the Members did rise. They had hardly the leisure all things to lay ope, But some felt in their Bellies if they had not a Pope. Some strictly stood to them, and others did fear, Each carried about them a fierce Cavalier. This business was handled by the Close-Committee, That privately met at a place in the City. So closely to voting the Members did fall, That the humble Sisters were overthown all. But they and their helpers came short at the last, Till at length the whole work on Prince Griffith was cast. And he with his troup did handle the matter, He pleased every Woman, as soon as he came at her. The business had like to have gone on their side, Had not Pym perswaded them not to confide. For rather then peace, to fill the Common-Wealth, He said hee'd do them every night himself. Thursday. This Day a great fart in the house they did hear, Which made all the members make buttons for fear; And one makes nine speeches while the business was hot, And spake through the nose that he smelt out the plot. He takes it to task, and the Articles drawes, As a breach of their own Fundamental-lawes. Now Letters were read which did fully relate A victory against New-Castle of late; That hundreds were slain, and hundreds did run, And all this was got ere the battel begun. This then they resolved to make the best on; And next they resolved upon the question, That Bonfires and praises, the Pulpit and Steeple, Must all be suborned to couzen the People. But the policy was more mony to get, For the conquests dear bought and far enough set, Such victories in Ireland, although it be known They strive to make that Land as bad as our own. No sooner the mony for this was brought hether, But a croud of true Letters came flocking together, How Hotham and's army and others were beaten. This made the blew Members to startle and threaten. And these by all means must be kept from the City, And only refered to the Privy-Committee. And they presently with an Extempore vote, Which they have used so long, that they learned by rote, They stil'd them malignant, and to lyes they did turn them, Then Corbet in stead of the Hangman, must burn them. And he after that an Ordinance drawes, That none should tell truth that disparag'd the cause. Then Pym like a Pegasus trots up and down, And takes up an Angel to throw down a crown. He stands like a Centaure and makes a long speech, That came from his mouth, and part from his breech. He moves for more Horse, that the Army may be Part Mans flesh and horse flesh, as well as he; And hee'l be a Colonel as well as another, But durst not ride a horse, 'cause a horse rid his Mother, Friday. Sir Hugh Cholmley for being no longer a Traytor, Was accus'd of treason in the highest Nature; Cause he (as they bad him) his Souldiers did bring, To turn from Rebellion and fight for the King. They voted him out, but, nor they nor their men Could vote him into the house agen. Sir Davids Remonsirance next to them was read, From the Cities round body and Isaacs the head. 'Twas approv'd; but one cause produc'd a denial, That all Traytors be brought to a Legal trial. For tis against reason to vote or to do Against Traytors when they are no other but so. Because about nothing so long they sit still, They hold it convenient Diurnalls to fill. And therefore they gave their Chronographer charge To stuff it with Orders and Letters at large. The King by's Prerogative, nor by the Law, Can speak nor print nothing his people to draw. Yet Pennyles Pamphletters they do maintain, VVhose only Religion is Stipendary gain. Yet Cum Privilegio, against King and the State, The treason that's taught them (like Parrats) they prate. These Hackneyes are licen't what ever they do, As if they had Parliament priviledge too. Thus then they consult: so zealous they are, To settle the peace of the Kingdom by war. But against Civil-war their hatred is such, To prevent it they'l bring in the Scots and the Dutch. They had rather the Land be destroyd in a minute, Then abide any thing that has loyalty in it; And yet their rebellion so neatly they trim, They fight for the King, but they mean for King Pym. These all to fight for, and maintain are sent The Lawes of England: but New-England is meant. And though such disorders are broke in of late, They keep it the Anagram still of a State. For still they are plotting such riches to bring To make Charles a rich and glorious King. And by this rebellion this good they will do him, They'l forfeit all their Estates unto him. No Clergy must medle in Spirituall affairs, But Layton nere heard of it, losing his ears, For that he might be deaf to the prisoners cries, To a spiritual Goalers place he must rise. The rest have good reason for what they shall do, For they are both Clergy and Laytie too. Or else at the best when the question is stated, They are but Mechanniks newly translated. They may be Committees to practise their bawling, For stealing of horse is spirituall calling. The reason why people our Martyrs ador'd, 'Cause their ears being cut off their fame sounds the more. 'Twas ordered the Goods of Malignants and Lands, Shall be shar'd among them, and took into their hands. They have spirits for more malignants to come, That every one in the house may have some. Then down to Guild-Hall they return their thanks, To the fools whom the Lottery has cheated with blancks. Satterday. This day there came newes of the taking a Ship, (To see what strange wonders are wrought in the deep) That a troop of their horse ran into the Sea, And pull'd out a ship alive to the key. And after much prating and fighting they say, The ropes serv'd for traces to draw her away. Sure these were Sea-horses, or else by their lying They'd make them as famous for swimming as rlying. The rest of the day they spent to bemoan Their Brother the Round-head that to Tyburn was gone. And could not but think it a barbarous thing, To hang him for killing a friend to the King. He was newly baptized, and held it was good To be washed, yet not in water, but blood. They ordered for his honour to cut off his ears, And make him a Martyr: but a Zelot appears, And affirm'd him a Martyr, for although 'twas his fate To be hang'd, yet he dy'd for the good of the State. Then all fell to plotting of matters so deep, That the silent Speaker fell down fast asleep. He recovers himself and rubs up his eyes, Then motions his house that 'twas time to rise. So home they went all, and their business referr'd To the Close-Committee by them to be heard; They took it upon them, but what they did do, Take notice that none but themselves must know. Postscript. Thus far we have gone in Rythme to disclose, VVhat never was utter'd by any in prose. If any be wanting, twas by a mishap, Because we forgot to weight by the map. For over the Kingdom their orders were spread, They have made the whole body as bad as the head. And now made such work that they all do, Is but to read Letters and answer them too. VVe thought to make Finis the end of the story, But that we shall have more business for you. For (as their proceedings do) so shall our Pen, Run roundly from Munday to Munday agen. And since we have begun, our Muse doth intend, To have (like their votes) no beginning nor end. FINIS. [I] On the demolishing the Forts. Is this the end of all the toil, And labour of the Town? And did our Bulwarks rise so high, Thus low to tumble down? All things go by contraries now, We fight to still the Nation, Who build Forts to pull down popery, Pull down for Edification. These Independents tenets, and Their wayes so pleasing be. Our City won't be bound about, But stands for liberty. The Popish doctrine shall no more Prevail within our Nation; For now we see that by our works, There is no Justification. What an Almighty army's this, How worthy of our praising, That with one vote can blow down that All we so long were raising! Yet lets not wonder at this change, For thus 'twill be withall. These works did lift themselvs too high, And pride must have a fall. And when both houses vote agen, The Cavies to be gone, Nor dare to come within the lines, Of Communication: They must reserve the sence or else, Referr't to the Divines, And they had need sit seven years more Ere they can read those lines. They went to make a Gotham ont, For now they did begin To build these mighty banks about, To keep the Cuckoes in. Alas what need they take such pains! For why a Cucko here. Might find so many of his mates, Hee'l sing here all the year. Has Isaac our L. Mayor, L. Mayor, With Tradesmen and his wenches, Spent so much time, and cakes and beer, To edifie these trenches! All trades did shew their skill in this, Each wise an Engineer: The Mairess took the tool in hand, The maids the stones did bear. These Bulwarks stood for Popery, And yet we never fear'd um, And novv they vvorship and fall dovvn, Before those calves that reard 'um. But though for superstition, The crosses have been down'd, Who'ld think these works vvould Popish turn, That ever have been round? This spoiles our Palmistry; for vvhen VVee'l read the Cities fate, VVe find nor lines nor crosses novv, As it hath had of late. No vvonder that the Aldermen, VVill no more mony lend, VVhen they that in this seven years, Such learned vvorks have pen'd, Novv to debase their lofty lines, In vvhich the vvits delighted, 'Tis thought they'l nere turn Poets more, Because their vvorks are slighted. These to a dolefull tune are set, For they that in the tovvn. Did every vvhere cry Up go vve, Novv they must sing down dovvn. But if that Tyburn do remain, VVhen tother slighted be, The Cits will thither flock and sing, Hay, hay, then up go we. [II] The Clown. 1 Ah surra, is't a come to this? That all our VVeeze-men do zo miss? Esdid think zo much avore, Have we kept vighting here zo long. To zell our Kingdome vor a zong, O that ever chwor a bore! 2 Echave a be a Cavaliero, Like most Weeze-men that escood heaor, And shoor sdid wish 'um well, But within sdid zee hovv the did go To cheat the King and country too, Esbid 'um all vorvvell. 3 Thoo vvhun the club men vvor so thick, Esput my zive upon a stick. And about eswent among 'um, And by my troth esdid suppose That they were honester then those That novv do zvvear they'l hang 'um 4 VVas't not enovv to make men vite, VVhen villains come by de and night, To plunder and undoe 'um, And Garrizons did vet all in. And steep the country to the skin, And vve zet nothing to 'um? 5 But vve had zoon a scurvy pluck, The better Men the worser luck. We had knaves and fools among us; Zome turn'd, zome cowards run away, And left a vew behind to try, And bloody rogues to bang us. 6 But now 'tis a come to a scurvy matter, Cham in the house of the Surgan strater, That have no grace, nor pitty, But here they peel, and pole, and squeeze; And when cha' paid them all their fees, They turn me to the mittee. 7 Like furies they zit by three and three, And all their plots to beggar we, Like Pilate and the Jewes; And zome do zee that both do know, Of thick above, and these below, 'Tis not a turd to chose. 8 But tho Echood redeem my grown, Es went to London to compown, And ride through weene and weather, Estaid there eight and twonty weeks, And chwor at last zo much to zeek, Aswhen Es vur'st come thither. 9 There whun's zeed voke to Church repair, Espi'd about vor Common-Prayer, But no zuch thing scould zee. The zed the Common'st that was there, Was vrom a tub or a wicker chair, They cal'd it stumpere. 10 Es hurd 'um pray, and every word, As the wor sick, they cri'd O Lord. And thoo ston still agen, And vor my life escould not know, Whun they begun or had ado, But when they zed amen. 11 They have a new word, 'tis not preach, Zdo think zome o'me did call it teach, A trick of their devizing, And there zo good a nap sdid vet; Till 'twas adoo, that's past sun-zet, As if twor but zun rising. 12 At night zo zoon's chwar into bed, Sdid all my prayers without book read. My creed and Pater noster, Me think zet all their prayers to thick, And they do go no more aleek, Then an apple'ls like an oyster. 13 Chad nead to watch zo well as pray, Whun chave to do with zuch as they, Or else Es may go zeek; They need not bid a monthy vast, For if zoo be these times do last, Twool come to zeav'n a weak. 14 Es waited there a huges time, And brib'd thick men to know my crime, That esmed make my pease, At last esvown my purse was vat, And if chwould be reform'd of that, They wood give me a release. 15 Esgid 'um bond vor neevescore pown, Bezides what chad a paid 'um down, And thoo they made me sweare, Whun chad a reckon'd what my cost are, Es swear'd chood and zit down aloster, Vor by my troth chawr weary. 16 Thoo when scome home esbote some beass And chowr in hope we should ha' peace, Case here's no Cavaliers, But now they zed's a new quandary, Tween Pendents and Presbytary, Cham agast they'l go by the ears. 17 Esbore in hon 'twould never last, The mittees did get wealth zo vast, And Gentlemen undoo, Usd wonderkins toold make one mad, That three or four livings had, Now can't tell whare to go. 18 Cha zeed the time when cscood gee, My dater more then zix of thee: But now by briles and stortions, Zome at our wedden ha bestow'd In gloves more then avore this vvood A made three daters portions. 19 One om ow'd me three hundred pown, Es zend vor zome, he paid it down; But vvithin three dayes ater, Ech had a ticket to restore The same agen, and six times more, Is'nt this a couzning matter! 20 Whun chood not do't smot to black-rod, A place vvas nere a made by God, And there chovvr vain to lye, Till chad a gidd'n up his bon, And paid a hundred more in hon, And thoo smed come avvy. 21 Nay novv they have a good hon made, What if the Scots should play the jade, And keep avvy our King? War they not mad in all these dangers, To go and trust the King with strangers? Was ever such a thing? 22 VVe ha' nor scrip nor scrole to show, Whether it be our King or no, And if they should deny an, They'l make us vight vor 'n once more, As well's agenst'n heretovore, How can vve else come by'n. 23 They had been better paid 'um down Their vorty hundred thousand pown, And zo zet 'um gwine, Vor cham agast avore thee go, The'll hav' our grown and mony too, Cham sore afeard of mine. 24 Another trick they do devize, The vive and twonty part and size. And there at every meeting, We pay vor wives and childrens pole More then they'l ever yeild us whole, 'Tis abomination cheating. 25 We can nor eat, nor drink, nor lye, We our own wives by and by; VVe pay to knaves that couzen; My dame and I ten children made, But now we do gee of the trade, Vor fear should be a douzen. 26 Then lets to clubs agen and vight, Or lets take it all out right; Vor thus they mean to sare, All thick be right, they'l strip and use, And deal with them as bad as Jews, All custen voke beware. III. On a Butchers Dog that bit a Commanders Mare that stood to be Knight of a Shire [1] All you that for Parliament members do stand For County, Burrough or Cittie. Listen now to my song, which is doleful for and A lamentable ditty. 2 For you must take notice that there was a Dog, Nay a Mastiff dog ('you see) And if this great dog were ty'd to a great clog, It had been full happy for we. 3 And eke there was a great Colonel stout, That had been in many a slaughter, But this Mastiff to eat him was going about, As you shall hear hereafter. 4 You bloody Malignants why will you still plot? 'Twill bring you to hanging you know; For if this dog had done what he did not, How had he been us'd I trow! 5 But happy was it for sweet Westminster When they went to make their choice; That this plot was found out, for why should this cur In Elections have a voice? 6 For surely this Mastiff, though he was big, And had been lucky at fighting, Yet he was not qualifi'd worth a fig And therefore he fell a biting. 7 But whom do you think? A thing of great note, And a worthy Commanders Mare, O what a strange battel had there been fought, Had they gone to fight dog, fight bear. 8 This dog was a Leveller in his heart, Or some Tub-preaching Cur, For honour or greatnesse he car'd not a fart, And lov'd neither Lord nor Sir. 9 For when the Commander was mounted on high, And got above many a brother, It angred this dog at the guts verily, To see one man above another. 10 And therefore he run at him with open mouth, But it seems the dog was but dull, He had as good took a bear by the tooth, As mistook a horse for a bull. 11 But this plot was discover'd in very good time, And strangely, as you may perceive, For the people saw him committing this crime; And made him his biting leave. 12 And so they were parted without any harm, That now any body seeth, For it seems this dog that made all this alarme, Did but only shew his teeth. 13 So this Cavaleer cur was beaten full sore, And had many a knock on the pate, But they serv'd him aright if they had beat him more For medling with matters of State. 14 Now heaven look down on our noble Protector, His Commanders and Members eke, And keep him from the teeth of every Elector, That is not able to speak. 15 And hang all such dogs as their honours do hate, Let them clear themselves if they can, For if they be suffered to be in the State, They'l conspire against horse and man. IV. The New Knight Errant. [1] Of Gyants and Knights &amp;, their wonderful fights We have stories enough in Romances, But i'le tell you one new, that is strange &amp; yet true, Though t'other are nothing but fancies. 2 A Knight lately made of the Governing trade, Whose name he'l not have to be known; Has been trucking with fame, to purchase a name, For 'tis said he had none of his own. 3 He by Fortunes design, should have been a Divine, And a pillar no doubt of the Church; Whom a Sexton (God wot) in the bellf'ry begot, And his Mother did pig in the porch. 4 And next for his breeding, 'twas learned hogfeeding, With which he so long did converse, That his manners &amp; feature, was so like their nature Youl'd scarce know his sweetness from theirs. 5 But observe the device of this Noblemans rise, How he hurryed from trade, to trade, From the grains he'd aspire to the yest, &amp; then higher, Till at length he a Drayman was made. 6 Then his dray-horse and he, in the streets we did see, With his hanger, his sling and his jacket; Long time he did watch, to meet with his match, For he'd ever a mind to the placket. 7 At length he did find, out a Trull to his mind, And Ursula was her name; Oh U fly quoth he, and oh Tom then quoth she, And so they began their game. 8 But as soon as they met, O such babes they did get, And blood-royal in 'um did place, From a swineheard they came, a she-bear was their Dam, They were suckled as Romulus was. 9 At last when the rout, with their head did fall out, And the wars thereupon did fall in, He went to the field, with a sword, but no shield, Strong drink was his buckler within. 10 But when he did spy, how they dropt down &amp; die, And did hear the bullets to sing; His armes he flung down, and run fairly to town, And exchang'd his sword for his sling. 11 Yet he claimed his share, in such honours as were Belonging to nobler spirits; That ventur'd their lives, while this Buffon survies To receive the reward of their merits. 12 When the wars were all done, he his fighting begun, And would needs shew his valour in peace, Then his fury he flings, at poor conquer'd things, And frets like a hog in his grease. 13 For his first feat of all, on a Wit he did fall, A wit as some say, and some not, Because he'd an art, to rime on the quart, But never did care for the pot. 14 And next on the cocks, he fell like an Ox, Took them and their Masters together; But the combs and the spurs, kept himself &amp; his Sirs, Who are to have both or neither. 15 The cause of his spite, was because they would fight, And because he durst not he did take-on; And said they were fit, for the pot, not the spit, And would serve to be eaten with bacon, 16 But flesh'd with these spoyles, the next of his toyles, Was to fall with wild beasts by the ears, To the Bearward he goeth, &amp; then opened his mouth; And said, oh! are you there with your bears. 17 Our stories are dull, of a cock and a bull, But such was his valour and care; Since he bears the bell, the tales that we tell, Must be of a cock and a bare. 18 The crime of the bares was, they were Caveleers, And had formerly fought for the King; And pull'd by the Burrs, the roundheaded Curs, That they made their ears to ring. 19 Our successour of Kings, like blind fortune flings, Upon bim both honour and store; Who has as much right, to make Tom a Knight, As Tom has desert, and no more. 20 But Fortune that whore, still attended this Brewer, And did all his atchievements reward; And blindly did fling, on this lubberly thing, More honour, and made him a Lord. 21 Now he walks with his spurs, and a couple of curs At his heels, which he calls Squires; So when honour is thrown, on the head of a clown; 'Tis by Parasites held up, and Lyars. 22 The rest of his pranks, will merit new thanks, With his death, if we did but know it; But we'l leave him and it, to a time and place fit, And Greg. shall be funeral Poet. V. The New Mountebanck. If any body politick, Of plenty or ease be very sick, There's a Physitian come to Town, Of far fetcht fame and high renown: Though call'd a Mountebank, 'tis meant Both words being French, a Parliament; From Geneva and Amsterdam, From Germany and Scotland came; Now lies in London, but the place If men say true, is in his face. His scaffold stands on Tower hill, When he on Strafford try'd his skill: Off, went his head, you'l think him slain, But straight 'twas voted on again. Diurnals are his weekly bills, Which speak how many he cures or kills: But of the Errata he'l advise, For cure read kill, for truth read lies. If any Traytor be diseased With a soreneck, and would be eased; There is a pill, they call a Vote, Take it ex tempore it shall do't. If any conscience be too strict, Here's several pills, from Lectures pickt, Which swallowed down will stretch it full, As far as 'tis from this to Hull. Is any by religion bound, Or Law, and would be looser found; Here's a Glister which we call His priviledge o're-topping all. Is any money left, or plate, Or goods? bring't in at any rate: He'l melt three shillings into one, And in a minute leave you none. Here's powder to inspire the lungs, Here's water that unties your tongues; Spight of the law, 'twill set you free, To speak treason only lispingly. Here's Leeches, which if well apply'd, And fed, will stick close to your side, Till your superfluous blood decay, Then they'l break and drop away. But here's a soveraign Antidote, Be sure our Soveraign never know't; Apply it as the Doctour pleases, 'Twill cure all wounds and all diseases. A drug none but himself e're saw, 'Tis call'd a Fundamental Law: Here's Glasses to delude your sight, Dark Lanthornes here, here bastard light. This if you conquer trebbles the men, If loose a hundred, seems but ten. Here's Opium to lull asleep, And here lie dangerous plots insteep. Here stands the safety of the Citty, There hangs the invisible Committee. Plundring's, the new Philosophers stone, Turnes war to Gold, and Gold to none. And here's an Ordinance that shall, At one full shot enrich you all. He's skilled in the Mathmaticks, And with his circle can do fine tricks. By raising spirits that can smell Plots that are hatcht as deep as hell: Which ever to themselves are known, The Devil's ever kind to his own. All this he gratis doth, and aith, He'l only take the publick faith, Flock to him then make no delay, The next fair wind he must away. VI. The Saints Encouragement. Written in 1643 Fight on brave Souldiers for the cause, Fear not the Caveleers; Their threatnings are as senselesse, as Our Jealousies and fears. 'Tis you must perfect this great work, And all Malignants slay, You must being back the King again The clean contrary way. Tis for Religion that you fight, And for the Kingdomes good, By robbing Churches, plundring men, And shedding guiltlesse blood. Down with the Orthodoxal train, All Loyal Subjects slay; When these are gone we shall be blest The clean contrary way. When Charles we've bankrupt made, like us Of Crown and power bereft him; And all his loyal subjects slain, And none but Rebels left him. When we've beggar'd all the Land, And sent our Truncks away, We'l make him then a glorious Prince; The clean contrary way. 'Tis to preserve his Majesty, That we against him fight, Nor are we ever beaten back, Because our cause is right, If any make a scruple on't, Our Declarations say Who fight for us, fight for the King, The clean contrary way. At Keynton, Branford, Plymmouth, York, And diverse places more; What victories we Saints obtain'd, The like ne're seen before. How often we Prince Robert kill'd, And bravely won the day, The wicked Cavaleers did run The clean contrary way. The true Religion we maintain, The Kingdomes peace, and plenty; The priviledg of Parliament Not known to one of twenty: The antient Fundamental Laws, And teach men to obey; Their Lawful Soveraign, and all these, The clean contrary way. We subjects Liberties preserve, By, prisonment and plunder, And do inrich our selves and state By keeping the wicked under. We must preserve Mecannicks now, To Lecturize and pray; By them the Gospel is advanc'd, The clean contrary way. And though the King be much misled By that malignant crew; He'l find us honest, and at last, Give all of us our due. For we do wisely plot, and plot Rebellion to destroy, He sees we stand for peace and truth, The clean contrary way. The publick faith shall save our souls, And good out-works together, And ships shall save our lives that stay, Only for wind weather. But when our faith and works fall down, And all our hopes decay, Our Acts will bear us up to heaven, The clean contrary way. V. Written in 1648. Come let us be merry Drink Claret and Sherry, And cast away care and sorrow; He's a fool that takes care for to morrow. Why should we be droopers, To save it for Troopers. Let's spend our own, And when all is gone, That they can have none, Then the Roundheads and Caves agree. 2 Then fall to your drinking, And leave of this shrinking, Let Square-heads and Round-heads quarrel We have no other foe but the barrel, These cares and disasters, Shall ne're be our Masters, English and Scot, Doth both love a pot, Though they say they do not, Here the Roundheads and Caves agree. 3 A man that is armed With liquor is charmed, And proofe against strength and cunning, He scorns the base humour of running. Our brains are the quicker, When season'd with liquor, Let's drink and sing Here's a health to our King, And I wish in this thing Both the Roundheads and Caves agree. 4 A pox of this fighting! I take no delighting In killing of men and plunder, A Gun affrights me like a thunder. If we can Live quiet, With good drink and diet, We wont come nigh, Where the bullets do fly, In fearing to die, Both the Roundheads and Caves agree. 5 Twixt Square-head and Round-head The Land is confounded, They care not for fight or battle, But to plunder our goods and cattle. When e're they come to us, They come to undo us, Their chiefest hate Is at our Estate, And in sharing of that, Both the Roundheads and Caves agree. 6 In swearing, and lying, In cowardly flying, In whoring, in cheating, in stealing, They agree; and all damnable dealing. He's a fool and a widgeon, That thinks they've Religion, For Law and right, Are o're rul'd by might, But when they should fight, Then the Roundheads and Caves agree. 7 Then while we have treasure, Let's spare for no pleasure, He's a fool that has wealth and wont spend it, But keeps it for Troopers to end it. When we've nothing to leave 'um, Then we shall deceive 'um, If all would be Of such humours as we We should suddainly see Both the Roundheads and Caves agree. VIII. The Scots Curanto. Written in 1645. [1] Come, come away to the English wars, A fig for our Hills and Valleys, 'Twas we did begin, and will lengthen their jarrs, We'l gain by their loss and folleys; Let the Nations By invasions, Break through our barrs, They can get little good by their salleys. 2 Though Irish and English entred be, The State is become our Debtor. Let them have our Land, if their own may be free And the Scot will at length be a getter. If they crave it Let them have it, What care we? We would fain change our Land for a better. 3 Long have we longed for the English Land, But we're hindred still by disasters; But now is their time, when they can't withstand, But are their own Countreys wasters. If we venter, We may enter By command, And at last we shall grow to be Masters. 4 When at the first we began to rebell, Though they did not before regard us, How the name of a Scot did the English quell, Which formerly have out-dar'd us. For our coming And returning, They pay'd us well, And royally did reward us. 5 The better to bring our ends about, We must plead for a Reformation; And tickle the minds of the giddy-brain'd rout, With the hopes of an innovation. They will love us And approve us, Without doubt, If we bring in an alteration. 6 Down with the Bishops and their train, The Surplice and Common prayers, Then will we not have a King remain, But we'l be the Realmes surveyers. So by little And a little We shall gain All the Kingdom without gain-sayers. 7 And when at the last we have conquer'd the King, And beaten away the Caveleers, The Parliament next must the same ditty sing, And thus we will set the State by the ears. By their jarring And their warring We will bring, Their estates to be ours, which they think to be theirs. 8 And thus when among us the Kingdom is shar'd, And the people are all made beggars like we; A Scot will be as good as an English Leard, O! what a unity this will be. As we gain it We'l retain it By the sweard And the English shall say, bonny blew cap for me. IX. Written in 1645. Though Oxford be yielded, &amp; Reading be taken, I'll put in for quarter at thy Maiden-head, There while I'm insconsed, my Standards unshaken Lie thou in my arms, and I in thy bed. Let the young zelots march with their wenches, Mounting their tools to edifie trenches. While thou and I do make it our pleasure, To dig in thy Mine for the purest Treasure, Where no body else shall plunder but I. And when we together in battail do joyne, We scorn to wear arms but what are our own, Strike thou at my body, and I'll thrust at thine, By nakednesse best the truth is made known. Cannons may roar, and bullets keep flying, While we are in Battail, we never fear dying. Isaac and's wenches are busy a digging, But all our delight is in japping and jigging, And no body else shall plunder but I. And when at the last our bodies are weary, We'l straight to the Taverns our strength to recruit, Where, when we've refresht our hearts with Canary, We shall be the fitter again to go to't. We'l tipple and drink untill we do stagger, For then is the time for Souldiers to swagger. Thus night and day we'l thump it and knock it, And when we've no mony then look to your pocket For no body else shall plunder but I. X. A New Ballad. [1] A Ballad, a Ballad, a new one and true, And such are seldom seen; He that wont write Ballads, and sing 'um too, Has neither Wit nor Spleen. For a man may be furnished with so much matter. That he need not lie, or rail, or flatter, 'Twill run from his tongue as easie as water, And as swiftly though not so clean. 2 To see how the times are twirled about, Would make a dog laugh, 'tis true; But to see those turn with 'um, that had the Rumpgout. Would make a cat to spew. Those Knaves that have lived upon sequestration, And sucked the blood of the best of the Nation, Are all for the King by a new translation, He that wont believe't, is a Jew. 3 The poor Caveliers, thought all was their own, And now was their time to sway, But friends they have few, and mony they've none, And so they mistook their way. When they seek for preferrments the Rebells do rout 'um And having no mony, they must go without 'um, The Courtiers do carry such stomacks about 'um. They spake no English but pay. 4 And those verry rebells that hated the King, And no such office allow; By the help of their boldness, and one other thing, Are brought to the King to bow. And there both pardons, and honours they have, With which they think, they're secure and brave, But the title of Knight, on the back of a Knave, 's like a saddle upon a sow. 5 Those men are but fools as matters now stand, That would not be Rebels and Traytors, To grow rich and rant o're the best of the land, And tread on the poor Cinque Quaters. To do what they list, and none dare complain, To rise from a cart and drive Charles his waine, And for this be made Lords and Knights in grain, O 'tis sweet to ambitious natures. 6 If the times turne about 'tis but to comply, And make a formal submission, And with every new power to live and die, Then they are in a safe condition. For none are condemned but those that are dead, Nor must be secur'd, but those that are sled, And none but the poor rogues sequestred, The great ones buyes remission. 8 The Fortieth part of their riehes, will Secure t'other thirty nine; And so they will keep above us still, But hang't, we'l ne're repine. The Devil does into their natures creep, That they can no more from their villany keep, Then a Wolfe broke loose, can from killing of sheep, Or a Poet refrain from wine. 19 Now Heaven preserve our Merciful King, And continue his grace and pitty, And may his prosperity be like a spring, And stream from him to the City! May James and Henry those Dukes of renown, Be the two supporters of Englands Crown! And may all honest men injoy what's their own! And so I conclude my ditty. XI. The Holy Pedler. [1] From a Forraign shore I am not come to store, Your Shops with rare devices: No drugs do I bring From the Indian King, No Peacocks, Apes, nor Spices. Such wares I do show As in England do grow, And are for the good of the Nation, Let no body fear To deal in my ware, For Sacriledge now's in fashion. 2 I the Pedler am, That came from Amsterdam With a pack of new Religions, I did every one fit, According to's wit, From the Tub to Mahomets pigeons. Great trading I found, For my spiritual ground, Wherein every man was a medler; I made people decline, The learned Divine, And then they bought Heaven of the Pedler. 12 First Surplices I took, Next the Common-prayer book, And made all those Papists that us'd 'um; Then the Bishops and Deans, I strip'd of their means, And gave it to those that abus'd 'um. The Clergymen next, I withdrew from their Text, And set up the gifted brother; Thus Religion I made, But a matter of trade, And I car'd nor for one or t'other. 4 Then Tythes I fell upon, And those I quickly won, 'Twas profane in the Clergy to take 'um. But they serv'd for the Lay, Till I sold them away, And so did Religious make 'um But now come away, To the Pedler, I pray, I scorn to rob or cozen; If Churches you lack, Come away to my pack, Here's thirteen to the dozen. 5 Church Militants they be, For now we do see, They have fought so long with each other; The Rump's-Churches threw down, Those that stood for the Crown, And sold them to one another. Then come you factious crue, Here's a bargain now for you, With the spoiles of the Church you may revell; Now pull down the bells, And then hang up your selves, And so give his due to the Devil. XII. A Serious Ballade. Written in 1645. [1] I love my King and Country well, Religion and the Lawes, Which I'm mad at the heart that e're we did sell, To buy the good Old Cause. These unnatural warrs And brotherly jars, Are no delight or joy to me; But it is my desire, That the wars should expire, And the King and his Realms agree. 2 I never yet did take up armes, And yet I dare to dye. But I'll not be seduc'd by fanatical charmes, Till I know a Reason why. Why the King and the State, Should fall to debate, I ne're could yet a reason see, But I find many one, Why the wars should be done, And the King and his Realmes agree. 3 I love the King and the Parliament, But I love them both together; And when they by division asunder are rent, I know 'tis good for neither. Which so e're of those, Be victorious, I'm sure for us no good 'twill be, For our plagues will encrease, Unlesse we have peace, And the King and his Realms agree. 4 The King without them can't long stand, Nor they without the King, 'Tis they must advise, and 'tis he must command For their power, from his must spring. 'Tis a comfortlesse sway, Where none will obey. If the King han't's right, which way shall we? They may Vote and make Lawes, But no good they will cause, Till the King and his Realms agree. 5 A pure Religion I would have, Not mixt with humane wit; And I cannot endure that each ignorant knave, Should dare to meddle with it. The tricks of the law, I would faign withdraw, That it may be alike to each degree. And I faign would have such, As do medle so much, With the King and the Church agree. 6 We have pray'd and pay'd that the wars might cease, And we be freemen made, I would fight, if my fighting would bring any peace, But war is become a trade. Our servants did ride With swords by their side, And made their Masters footmen be; But we will be no more slaves, To the beggars and knaves, Now the King and the Realmes do agree. XIII. An Ode. Written in 1643. What's this that shrouds In these opacous clouds, The glorious face of heav'n, and dims our light? VVhat must we ever lye, Mantled in dark stupidity? Still groveling in a daily night? And shall we have no more the sun allow'd? VVhy does the sun grow dim? or do the stars grow proud? 2 VVhy should false zeal Thus scorch our common-weale, And make us slight bright Phebus purer fires? VVhy do these plannets run? They would, but cannot be the Sun, Yet every saucy flame aspires. Though they've no reason to affect the same, Since they have nought of fire, but the meer rage and name. 3 Now since our Sun Has left this Horizon, Can all the stars though by united pow'r, Undark the night, Or equal him in light? And yet they blaze to make him lowre. That star that looks more red then others are, Is a prodigious Comet and a blazing star. 4 The World's undone, When stars oppose the sun, And make him change his constant course to rest; His foaming Steeds, Flying those daring deeds, Ith' stables of the North or West. Whence we may fear he'l never more return, To light &amp; warme us, with his rayes, but all to burn. 5 Heav'n made them all, Yet not Anarchical, But in degrees and orders they are set; Should they all be In a grand Committee, In heavens painted chamber yet, Sol would out shine them: give me Phæbus ray, And let those Lantherns keep their borrowed light away. 6 Let's not admire This new phantastick fire; That our vain eyes deceives and us misleads, Those Bares we see That would our Lyons be, Want tailes, and will want heads. The world will soon into destruction run, When bold blind Phaetons guide the chariot of the sun. XIV. Palinode. [1] No more, no more of this, I vow, 'Tis time to leave this fooling now, Which few but fools call Wit; There was a time when I begun, And now tis time I should have have done, And medle no more with it. He Physicks use doth quite mistake, That Physick takes for Physicks sake. 2 My heat of youth, and love and pride, Did swell me with their strong spring-tyde, Inspir'd my brain and blood, And made me then converse with toyes, Which are call'd Muses by the boyes, And dabble in their flood. I was perswaded in those dayes, There was no crown like love and bayes. 3 But now my youth and pride are gone, And age and cares come creeping on, And businesse checks my love; What need I take a needlesse toyle, To spend my labour, time and oyle, Since no design can move. For now the cause is ta'ne away, What reason ist th' effect should stay? 4 'Tis but a folly now for me, To spend my time and industry, About such uselesse wit; For when I think I have done well, I see men laugh, but cannot tell, Where't be at me, or it. Great madness 'tis to be a drudge, When those that cannot write dare judge. 5 Besides the danger that ensue'th, To him that speaks, or writes the truth, The præmium is so small, To be called Poet and wear bayes, And Factor turne of Songs and Playes, This is no wit at all. Wit only good to sport and sing, 's a needlesse and an endlesse thing. 6 Give me the Wit that can't speak sense, Nor read it, but in's own defense, Ne're learn'd but of his Grannum, He that can buy, and sell, and cheat, May quickly make a shift to get. His thousand pound per annum. And puchase without much ado, The Poems and the Poet too. EPISTLES. I. To C. C. Esq;. Inspired with love and kindled by that flame, Which from your eye and conversation came, I proceed Versifier, and can't chuse, Since you are both my Patron and my Muse. Whose fair example makes us know and do, You make us poets, and you feed us too. And though where are you are is Helicon. Since all the Muses proudly wait upon Your parts and person too; while we sit here And like Baals Priests our flesh do cut and tear. Yet, for our lives, can't make our baggage Muse Lend us a lift, or one rich thought infuse, Or be as much as midwife to a quibble, But leave us to our selves with pangs to scribble What, were we wise, we might well blush to view, While we're invoking them, they're courting you. Yet I conceive (and wont my notion smother) You and your house contribute to each other. Such hills, such dales, such plains, such rocks, such springs. And such a confluence of all such things As raise and gatifie the Muses, so That in one Night I was created PO- That's half a Poet, I cant reach to ET, Because I'm not a perfect Poet, yet And I despair perfection to attain, Unlesse I'm sent to school to you again. Alas! Sir London is no place for verse, Ingenious harmlesse thoughts, polite and terse, Our Age admits not, we are wrap'd in smoke; And Sin, and business, which the Muses choke. Those things in which true poesie takes pleasure, We here do want; tranquillity and leasure. Yet we have Wits, and some that for wits go, Some real ones, and some that would be so, But 'tis ill-natured wit, and such as still, To th'subject or the object worketh ill. A Wit to cheat, to ruine, to betray, Which renders uselesse, what we do or say. This wit will not bear verse, some things we have, Who in their out-side do seem briske and brave. And are as gaudy as the Chancellours purse; But full as Empty too. And here's our curse, Few men discerne the difference 'twixt Wit That's sterling, and that's not, but looks like it. Inrich us with your presence, make us know How much the Nation does to Derby owe. But if your businesse will not be withstood, Do what you can, since you can't what you wou'd. Those lovely sportings of your frolick Muse, Wherewith you blest me, send me to peruse; And out of gratitude, I'll send you mine, They'l rub your vertues, and so make them shine. Your charity and patience will in them, Find work t acquit, what justice must condemn. And if you please send one propitious line, To dignifie these worthlesse toyes of mine. The Reader charm'd by your's, may be so bold To read o're mine, which else he'ld not behold. And then in Spite of envy, pride, or lying, Must say h'has met with something worth the buying. II. The Answer. When in this durty corner of the World, Where all the rubbish of the rest is hurl'd Both men, and manners; this abandon'd place, Where scarce the Sun dares shew his radient face, I met thy lines, they made me wondring stand, At thy unknown, and yet the friendly hand Straight through the Air m'imagination flew To ev'ry Region I had seen, or knew; And kindly blest (at her returning home) My gready ear, with the glad name of Brome. Then I reproach't my self for my suspence, And mourn'd my own want of intelligence, That could not know thy celebrated Muse, (Though mask't with all the art, that art can use) At the first sight, which to the dullest eyes, No names conccal'd, nor habit can disguise. For who (ingenious friend) but only thee, (Who art the soul of wit, and courtesie) Writes in so pure, an unaffected strain, As shews wits ornament, is to be plain; Or would caresse a man condemn'd to lie Buryed from all humane society. 'Mongst brutes and bandogs in a Lernean fen, Whose Natives have nor souls, nor shape of men? How could thy Muse, that in her noble flight, The boading Raven cuff't, and in his height Of untam'd power, and unbounded place, Durst mate the haughty Tyrant to his face, Deigne an inglorious stoop, and from the sky Fall down to prey on such a worme as I? Her seeing (sure) my state, made her relent, And try to charme me from my banishment; Nor has her charitable purpose faild, For when I first beheld her face unvail'd, I kiss't the paper, as an act of grace Sent to retrive me from this wretched place, And doubted not to go abroad agen To see the world, and to converse with men: But when I tast the dainties of the Flood (Ravish't from Neptunes table for my food) The Lucrine Lakes plump Oysters I despise, With all the other Roman luxuries, And, wanton grown, contemn the famous breed Of Sheep and Oxen, which these mountains feed. Then as a Snake, benumn'd and fit t'expire, If laid before the comfortable fire Begins to stir, and feels her vitals beat Their healthful motion, at the quickning heet: So my poor muse, that was half starv'd before, On these bleak clifts; nor thought of writing more. Warm'd by thy bounty, now can hisse and spring, And ('tis believ'd by some) will shortly sting: So warm she's grown, and without things like these Minerva must, as well, as Venus freeze. Thus from a High-lander, I straight commence Poet, by vertue of thy influence, That with one Ray, can clods, and stones inspire, And make them pant, and breath poetick fire. And thus I am thy creature prov'd, who name, And fashion take from thy indulgent flame. What should I send thee then, that may befit A greatfull heart, for such a benefit; Or now proclaime, with a poetick grace, What thou hast made me from the thing I was; When all I writ, is artless, forc't, and dull, And mine as empty as thy fancy full? All our conceipts, alas! are flat, and stale. And our inventions muddy, as our Ale. No friends, no visiters, no company, But such, as I still pray, I may not see Such craggy, rough-hewn rogues, as do not fit, Sharpen and set, but blunt the edge of wit; Any of which (and fear has a quick eye) If through a perspective I chance to spy Though a mile off, I take th' alarme and run, As if I saw the Divel, or a Dunne. And in the Neighbouring rocks take sanctuary, Praying the Hills to fall, and cover me. So that my solace lies amongst my grounds, And my best companie's, my horse and hounds. Judge then (my friend) how far I am unfit To traffick with thee, in the trade of Wit, How Banck-rupt I am grown of all commerce, Who have all number lost, and air of verse. But if I could in living song set forth, Thy Muses glory, and thine own true worth, I then would sing an Ode, that should not shame, The writers purpose; nor the Subjects name. Yet, what a gratefull heart, and such a one, As (by thy vertues,) thou hast made thine own, Can poorly pay, accept for what is due, Which if it be not Rhythme, I'le swear 'tis true. C. Cotton. III. To his University Friend. Dear Captain. Want, the great Master of three greater things, Art, Strength, and boldness, gives this letter wings To kiss (that is salute) you and say A. B. To his renowned Captain S. P. D. And to request three greater things then those, Things that beget good verse, and Stubborn prose. The first is drink, which you did promise, woul'd Inform the brain; as well as warm the blood, Drink that's as powerfull and strong as Hector, And as inspiring as the old Poets Nectar, That dares confront the legislative sack, And lends more greek then your grave patriarch. But you may see heres none, for if that I, Had been well wet, these had not been so dry. The next is mony; which you said should be, Paid, and it may be 'twas, but not to me. Why (Friend) d'you think a man as big about As I, can live on promises, without Good drink or mony? how'll good sack be had? And who can live without sack, or with bad? What er'e your Accademicks talk or teach, Mind what they do, they mind not what they preach. In publick they may rail at Pope and Turk, And at the layeties avarice have a Firck, And say their aim is all to save the soul, But that Souls mony, which doe's all controul. Which I do only by the want on't know, But when it comes thou'lt see 'twill wonders do. The third is wit, which you affirmed here, Was in your Mines, and digg'd up every where. Jests, Verses, Tales, Puns, Satyrs, Quibbles too, And certain Bristoll words that like wit show. But none on't comes as yet, and all I see, Is you've the wit to keep it all from me. 'Tis troublesome and costly to have much. And if you had it, you would never grutch, Your needy Friend a little, prithee do Send me the last, and Il'e get t'other two. IIII. The Answer. Your Letter found us at good Clarret, Such as should be at, or are at. The lines were good; but that I wonder, As much as at a bladders thunder, That you who are not us'd to preach, That never to that art could reach, Your letter should so well divide, Into the first, third, second, head. Prithee tell me, just then came ye, Before you writ, from your C. Or hadst thou heard some Independent, First it, and thirdly it, till no end on't? Thirdly from you is as ill sounded, As Mass delivered by a roundhead. Or if your old Recorder should Try to speak Latine that is good. Drink the first head, you wisely laid, Drink alwayes gets into the head. Drink in plain silly troth you had, As strong as hop, or furnace made, Such as our Sophisters do take, When they old Latine jests would break. Such as if your Clients drink, Of law suites they would never think. Such as with Beef, and mutton were Enough to make you Knight o'th shire. But that it comes not you may thank Your Thames which swell'd above its bank. I think the London Brewers plot To encrease the Thames, that we should not, By our sublime and noble Beer, Shame all their puddle liquor there. So great the flood here, that the people Were wondrous fraid for your Pauls steeple. Least we should hear next Almanack, How London Bridge did fall or shake. Least it Westminster hall should drown, And then no place should there be found, Where men their gold and silver may Upon the Lawyers throw away. But stay, it may be all is lost, Broke by the ice, or stop'd by frost. Perchance the Boatmen let it run, Which either of us would have done. It may be they drew out the Vessel, To cheer themselves at merry Wassail. Perchance the Barrell in the way Did fall upon an holyday. Upon a Revell or a wedding, Or else, it may be, it call'd at Redding; Where the bold rout did rant of late, As if they drunk such beer as that. But if at last it there arrive, Drink it out while 'tis alive, Let not old Gossips of it tast, When they do praise their husbands last; When they tell stories, and do cry For their poor babe that last did dye. Nor it to Country Clients give, VVhen thou dost fees from them receive. But make a fire and send about, For all thy Friends the merry rout. Fetch out the bowl and drink it up, And think on him that fill'd the cup. Your next is money, which I promise, Full fifty pounds alas the summe is, That too shall quickly follow, if It can be rais'd from Strong or Tiffe. Pray pray that each moneth we may choose New Members for the commons house. Pray that our Act may last all year, That we may sooner spend our Beer. Pray that the Schollars may drink faster, And larger cups then they did last year. Pray heav'n to take away th' Excise, Pray I say with weeping eyes: Pray our malt grow good and cheap, And then of mony expect an heap. For Poems; Tom desires me tell ye, He minds not now his feet, but belly. He must for Pulpit now prepare, Or make bills for Apothecar- Y'and leave off these barren toyes VVhich feed not, only make a noyse. Yet he would faign from you receive, VVhat your more happy Muse did give. VVhich made Protectors love to hear, Though themselves wounded by them were. Songs, which are play'd on every tongue, And make a Christmas when they're sung. Thus shissling you much mirth and wit, As the Lord Mayor doth speak and spit. VVishing and praying till I'm weary, That you may drink the best Canary. That you may have Clients many, And talk in Guildhall wise as any, That the rich Londoners may fall out, And go to Law till money's all out, That every Citizen hate his Neighbour, As his wife doth Pope and Tyber. That the grave Alderman love no man, More then they did the Prayer-common. That Quarrels long may thence be spun About a Whistle or a Spoon, That th'itch of law may infect all London Till you are rich, and they are undone. That you may keep your good Dame yet here, Or when she dies may find a better. That two howers prayer and long Sermon, You may not hear above each terme one. And then your pew may be so easiy, That you may sleep when e're it please ye. That when from Tavern late you come, You misse the watch returning home, Or if you meet th'unmanner'd rabble, You may not out wit the Constable. V. To T. S. Thy Letter Friend, had the hard fate, To find me with a busie pate, VVhich still continues and will do, Till you meet me, or I meet you. Then prithee come thy wayes to me, Or else I vow i'll come to thee. So well I love thee that I doat, And make this shamelesse Letter showt. And it is more then I can do, To live in love and businesse too. P. B. and G. I had the luck To see, and drink a little pluck. VVhich they both said, they'ld do agen But broke their words like honest men, And shew'd themselves as errant lyars, As th' were 'prentice to the Tryers. But will they e're preach truth d'you think VVho are so false in point of drink? Since that some persons got some places, Decept and lying have been graces. I'm also told P. P. was here, But ne're came at me though so neer. VVhich I don't take amiss, for I Suppose his love's not wont to lie On the Male Sex, but by his Vote, Breeches should vail to petticoat. The drink that came from honest Tim, Had two ill properties, like him. Twas long a coming, but alas! In going swift as lighting 'twas. There's none oft left, you may conclude, By this, which is both flat and rude. Nor drink I sack, and so this time, Instead of wit you've only rythme. Wit is as scarce and wanting here VVith us, as mony with you there. Our Prince of Poets, who once writ. VVhat all admir'd, for art and wit Did lately stoop his Muse, and make her To write a Ballade of a Quaker. VVhich I have sent thee here with all, To see how witts do rise and fall. Just as our drink is bad or good, So verse is writ, so understood, But oh the mony (Tom) the money! As strong as Sampson, sweet as hony, How long! how long it is a coming! Such reckoning, such receipts, such summing, Belong to't, I shall choak I think, Before 'tis melted into drink! Those things you'l have me pray for, I Can't find in our Church-liturgie. To you therefore I make my suite, That you will set the boyes to do't, For I am told the Directory And your new prayers made ex tempore, Are all for mony very fit, Because they're only made for it. I like thee that apply'st thy parts, To preaching and such thriving arts, I prethee practise physick too, For if one wont, yet both will do. A handsome person with neat band, Small Cuffs, white gloves, smoth tongue and hand, If both a Doctour and a Priest, VVhat Ladie's able to resist? You may talk bawdy freely then, Before coy women and old men. And be of no Religion too, Yet profess all as other do. While the poor Poet tugs for wit, To make men laugh at him and it. And nothing gets by all his pains, But censures various and vain. From such as say they Judges are, And yet did never plead at bar. Undo their malice that condemn Let them write while we laugh at them. A poem I have sent thee heere, That dyes if thou shouldst be severe. And cause I've none worth sending down I've bought one cost me half a crown. And Dick Bromes playes which good must be, Because they were approv'd by thee. All which I hope will bring me back What all so Love, and I so lack. When my glasse beads to India come, They'l bring me pearls and Diamonds home. And thou wilt like the powers above, Returne a blessing for a Dove. VI. The Answer. My Friend, in troth, I'me glad to hear, That noise of Clients fills thy ear; Be sure let them not soon agree, Before thou art well greas'd with fee. If thou wantest coyn, the Cockneys Guildhall Or Westminster will to thee yeild all. Prethee fleece each City Coxcombe When they for law to th'Hall in flocks come. Make them pawn their garments wedding, Their Cupboards, Hangings, and their bedding. That when another Parliament Shall borrow for the good intent Of zeal, upon the faith call'd publick They may be poor and needy Job-like. That when again the Pulpet clawes Them to send plate into the cause, Their spoons, and rings to th' Hall of Grocers Their very wives may cry out no Sirs. But why dost bid me come to thee? I have no term there, nor no fee, What should a Scholler do at London But to spend mony, and be undone? When here with us a whole dayes expence VVill not swell up beyond one six pence. When we can play, can laugh, and drink And still the mony slowly shrink, When we here talk o'th' State as boldly As ever the Mercurius told lye. When we of policy are still chattering, (All which, 'tis true, we owe to Mat. Wren) When we know all the Pretty sputher Betwixt the one house and the other. When we can over one full flagon, Releive or plunder Coppen-hagen: When we do know what is, what not is, Related in the Hall, where Scottish. Raggs, once call'd colours, still remain, Tell me what profit 'tis, or gain, For me to take such useless pain, To come and hear all there again. But yet (remember now I promise And will perform as sure as Rome is.) Near Easter terme, like arrow swift, I Will ride up to thee, miles full fifty. Shalt see me come on Oxford beast, Which shall have one good leg at least. Such a doughty horse upon, Whose nose more then its legs shall run. So thin a Creauture that I've tride it, When its Master did bestride it. I plainly through his belly spy'd The boot and leg on th' other side. Next this, I'le get coat, boots, and spurs, And then Sir quickly I am yours. I'le come unless (which happen may) Gall'd Buttocks stop me on the way. Whether his ends be good or sinister, G. now from head to foot's a Minister. My judgment is he is turn'd Divine, Only to have wherewith to buy wine. He came home with each empty pocket, That th' one could not the other mock at. What ever others do, I'le swear Safely he us'd no Symonie there. He swears since He's a Country Parson, That he finds coming worldly cares on. Sayes, he believes since he has been there, You Lawyers do not only sin there, But that in Knavery White-Hall-gate, Out does all twixt Lud and Allgate. Our Friend is by this at Paris, Or if not there, he very near is. God send him home whole wind and limb, And keep his nose sound to the brim Some rogues say, Tim provides for one day, To wit the Sabbath or the Sunday. That at that time he alwayes is sick, Enough to stay at home and Physick. The Poet I confess doth stoop here From what is writ i'th' hill of Cowper. But for new bayes what need care D. Who so long since did bravely win um. Should such great Spirits alwayes do good, What they perform'd would then be too good. Thou next would'st have me turn Divine, And Doctor too, indeed 'tis fine, Physick and preaching ill agree, There is but one Religio Medici. Paul and every other 'Postle, (As the Scripture doth to us tell) That had the gift of healing, did Not cure the belly, heart or head, By hearbs, or Potions, Purge or Treacle, But by a plain down right miracle. I never heard that learned Moses. Whom God himself for Prophet chose his, In Egypt was Physitian, though there He kill'd as many, men as if he were. How pretty I should shew I faith, As in his Sums Aquinas saith, With hour-glass in one fist, and With Urinall in the other hand. To have my Pothecary say Such a Ladie's sick to day, And straight to have my Sexton calling, And ask me when he shall toll all in. If I must needs be both then name ye What kind of Doctor you would have me. Chymick? alas the costly furnace, Will quickly my small purse unfurnish, Or Galenist? that wont agree With my other trade Divinity. Nor with Preachers now the mode is't, To strive to make themselves Methodists. I wish you would a Lawyer had me, That indeed had quickly made me, 'Tis they bring all unto their purses, The Countries mony, and their curses. By poring on some mouldy Record, And bringing fools unto an accord. With Poets Men so hardly deal, They are scarce part o'th Commonweal. Father Apollo, and Mother Muses Gave all away to Pious uses. So that their Children must fair ill, That have nought left them but the bare hill. Lastly, my Friend you are too hard, To challenge a small Oxford Bard, To send you verse in hungry Lent, A fasting time and Pænitent; When I should be confessing sins, Of mine and too off other mens. You'd force me to commit one more, (And sure 'twere not the least o'th score) To make bad Rythmes: which needs are dismal, When Stomacks great, and Commons is small. To tell y'a plain, but Christian truth, Verse must be fat, that would be smooth. An Army (said the King of Sweden (He that did know so well to lead one) Is a great beast, which if you draw, You must begin first from the maw. So say I of the beast a Poet. (And all our Rithming Kindred know it) Who ere intend a Poem to make, He must begin first with his stomack, Good sooth at this dull time o'th year, When we must drink plain physick beer, When all to temperance are bent here, To expiate the sins o'th Winter When we must leave our former merr'ment, Because forsooth our bloods now ferment. When we must no more Taverns survey, But be content with juyce of scurvey. When such thin Commons do us serve, As would a very Spaniard starve: When wee've such fish set on our board, Which scarce your fish whores would afford, Without stop'd nose to look upon, Nor swear 'tis sweet, though 'twere her own. At this lean time I say, troth, scarce I Can write as well as P. from Jersey. Whose Rythmes were yet so paultry that All Men that heard them wish'd his fate. Pray'd rather then such stuffe to hear, They might with th' Author loose each ear. Upon my conscience such a mood in, As I am now, was learn'd John Goodwin, When he so high of Worster fight, In Elemosinary verse did write. Such Rythmes the King might thank that day. Which forced him to run away. Out of their sound that would have more Grated his cars then 's lost before. (In such a meager season now By all the Poets hills I vow) Should I be forc'd my muse to raise, She'd sound as bad as Sterries praise. I think I should come short of Wither, Whose quill had ink, but not one feather. Nor in this humour verse can I brew, Better then Psalmes turn'd out of Hebrew. Unhappy Psalmes! that so long lasted To be at length so metaphrasted. By good old provost Francis Rous, A member of the other house. Who with much pains and many a pang, At last made Davids Lute cry twang. The sacred harp so sadly by him strung, Seems as if still it on the Willowes hung. Then be content till after Easter, By that I'll cheer my Muse, and feast her. And then (God send it prove no lie,) She that cannot now creep, shall flie. VII. An Epistle from a Friend to the Author upbraiding him with his writing Songs. Dear friend, believ't my love has spurr'd me on For once to question thy discretion: And by right reason deifyd by thee, I blame thee for the wrongs to poesie Thou hast committed; in betraying it To th'censure (not the judgment) of each wit; Wit, did I say? Things whose dull spirits are Apt only to applaud, what e're they hear, Be't good or bad, so throated to their mind, Johnson and Taylor like acceptance find. Why pedler'st thus thy Muse? Why dost set o'pe A shop of wit, to set the fidlers up? Fie prodigal, canst statuated shine By the abuse of Women, praise of wine? Or such like toyes, which every hour are By every pen spu'd forth int' every ear. Thy comely Muse dresse up in robes, and raise Majestick Splender to thy wreath of bayes. Don't prostitute her thus, her Majesty, (Like that of Princes) when the vulgar see To frequently, respect and awe are fled, Contempt and scorn remaineth in their sted: But I have done, and fear I've done amisse, Being doubtful, lest thou't give thy Fidle's this. I. B. VIII. The Answer Did I not know thee friend, and that this fit Comes not to shew thy malice but thy wit, I might this action censure, and reprove As well thy want of judgment, as of love; And think my Muse, were doubly now forlorne Below thy envy, yet not above thy scorne. But yet I wonder why thy reason thus, Which thou call'st right, and's magnify'd by us. And justly too, should vote me indiscreet, Because my Poems do with all sorts meet, How can I help it? Who can circumscribe His words or works, within the small-wise tribe? And you the hearers kind applause do blame, When charity bids us all do the same. If good we must, and if the wit be such That it does need, who would not lend a crutch We're mortal Writers, and are forc'd t'a truce, For he that gives, may well expect abuse. Johnson and Taylor in their kind were both Good Wits, who likes one need not t'other loath. Wit is like beauty, nature made the Joaue, As well's the Lady. We see every one Meets with a match. Neither can I expect, Thou more my muse then Mistress should'st affect, And yet I like them both, if you don't too Can't you let them alone for those that do? Now if thou'ldst know the very reason why I write so oft, to please my self, say I. I know no more why I write more then thee, Then why my father got more sons then me. Nor pedling call't, for those in Cheap as well, As they at Fairs expose their wares to sell. But I give freely mine, and though it be To Fidlers, yet 'tis for a company; And all those gifts are well bestowed, which At once do make us merry, and then rich. If making Sonnets were so great a sin, Repent, 'twas you at first did draw me in. And if the making one Song be not any, I can't believe I sin in making many. But oh! the theemes displease you, you repine Because I throw down women, set up wine. Why that offends you, I can see no reason, Unlesse 'cause I, not you, commit the treason. Our judgments jump in doth, we both do love Good Wine and Women, if I disapprove The slights of some, the matters understood, I'm ne're the lesse belov'd by th' truly good. You'ld have no phancy blown upon, but must Have all new broach'd or can'd to please your gust. When this demand of yours is grown as old As what you quarrel at, and as often told. And their's old Wits that will as much condemn Your novelty, as you can censure them. Now for those robes in which you'l have me dress My homely muse, and write with loftiness, Talk of State matters, and affairs of Kings, Thou know'st we've beat our heads about those things, Till I'd my teeth neer beat out, after all My toyl, the wormes must turn poetical. He that courts others ears may use designes. Be coy and costive; but my harmelesse lines. If they produce a laughter are well crown'd, Yet though they've sought none, have acceptance found. With these I sport my self and can invite My self and friends t'a short and sweet delight; While all our tedious toils, which we call playes, Like the great ship, lye slugging in their bayes. And can no service do without great cost And time, and then our time and stomach's lost. But I must write no more for fear that we Be like those brethren in divinity. Whilst thou dost go to make my flash expire, I raise thy flame and make it burn much higher. Only because thou doubt'st I should bestow Your lines upon my Fidlers, thou shalt know, That had they been upon a business fit, And were I subject equall to thy wit. T'had gone, and thou shouldst sing them too, and so Be both the poet and the fidler too. IX. To a Lady desiring a copy of a Song Madame, You are a poetress 'tis true, Nor had we men been Poets but for you; Tis from your sex we've learnt our art and wit, 'Tis for your sakes that we do practice it. Your subtler sex first ventred on the tree, Where knowledg grew, and pluck'd the fruit, which we Did only tast, and that at second hand, Yet by that hand, &amp; tast we're all trepan'd, And our posterity the dome endures; You op'd our eyes, as you know who, did yours. By your command this Song thus rudely pend, To you I do commit, though not commend, To shew what duty I'm arriv'd unto, You cannot sooner bid, then I can do. Nor can your active soul command and sway With more delight, &amp; pride, then mine obey. I will not say this Poems bad or good, 'Tis as 'tis lik'd, and as 'tis understood. A Poems life, and death dependeth still Not on the Poets wit, but Readers will. Should it in sence seem rascal, low and dull, Your eye can make it sprightly, plump and full. And if it it should be lame, I hope twill be Cause somewhat like your self, more pleasing t'ye. If it should trip assist it with your hand, You may lend feet, for you can make things stand. One touch of yours can cure it's ev'll, and then 'Tis made by your fair hand, not my blunt pen, Useful for love, or slighting youll it find, For love before, or for disdain behind. Be't as you please, to more it can't aspire, 'Tis all it can deserve, or I desire. X. To his Friend C. S. Esquire. Inspir'd with plum-broth, and minc'd pies, This letter comes in humble wise, To know how Su. and how you do? Or whether you do do; or no. Whether you Christmas keep, or not? For here we such a Mayor have got, That though our tavernes open stand, Church doors are shut, by his command. He does as good as say (we think) Leave off this preaching, and go drink. But this I doubt's no news to you, The Countrey's Atheist part, part Jew. And care no more for Christ or's Mass, Then he for them: So let 'um pass. And could the Priests be sure of pay, They'ld down with that, and to'ther day. Yet spite of all our May'r could say, We would not fast, though could not pray. Here's feasting still throughout the City, And drinking much (the more's the pitty.) And that's the cause why all this time, I did not answer your last Rithme: Nor do I know; Tis not my fashion In verse to make a disputation. What ever Su. and you havewrit. Shews both your kindness and your wit. But only I desire to know If your'e a member made or no, For here we have a great adoe, About our choice, whom, how, and who. Elects, or is Eelected; some To be made members send, and come, While others of the wiser sort, Sit still at home, and care not for't. Richard, 'tis thought, has no intent To have an endless Parliament. Nor must they share his goods and lands, For what he has hee'l keep in's hands. Much is not left to be divided, The business has so well been guided; Nay he himself (I tell no lye) Wants mony more then you or I. No reason therefore can I see Why you should bustle much to be. A Senatour, unless it were, For honour, yet that is but air, And not the sweet'st, or saf'st, but still Depends on other peoples will. But trust me (Charles) you have a vain That does more love, and honour gain, And longer keepe't then all the tricks, Of those that study Politicks. Protections needless, for (they say) You owe no debts, that you can pay, To Nature one, which during life, You cannot pay, nor that t'your Wife. Yet I would have you come away, That though the house don't meet, we may. When every one, gets up, and ride, 'Tis good to be o'th rising side. For as i'th Church, so 'tis i'th State, Who's not Elect, is Reprobate. XI. To C. S. Esquire. Justice. I've waited long to find thee here, Peep'd into th' house, but could not see the there. I went to th' tother-house, but thy're so new, They no such name or person ever knew. 'Twas for this cause, my pen has slept so long, I hop'd to see thee in that learned throng. And did believe some borough would in pitty, Have sent thee up to dignifie our City. But, corporations do not well discern, What's for their good, and their too old to learn. Had our whole Senate been such men as thou, They'd not been routed, but sate still till now. But they'd be medling, and to voting fall, Against the sword, and that out-votes them all, Had they observ'd thy Councel, they'ld been safe Stick to the strongest side, and think, and laugh. What matter i'st, what those in Office say, When those that are in power, do an answer nay? A Cutlers shop affords us stronger law, Then Cook or Littleton ere read, or saw. But be content, let them do what they will, Be thou a Justice I'm Atturney still. A poor Attourney is a safer thing Now, then to be Protector or a King. Our noble Sheriffs a dying, and I fear Will never feast us more in Taunton-Shire, Pray tell your lovely Sue, I love her still, As well's I dare, let her not take it ill, I write not to her, I've time enough, 'tis true, But have not wit enough to deal with Sue. XII. To C. S. Esquire. Dear Charles, I'm thus far come to see thy face, Thy pretty face, but this unhappy place. Does not afford it, and I'm told by some, That want of Tythes, makes thee thou can'st not come Why (Charles) art thou turn'd Priest? and at this time When Priests themselves have made their coat a crime? And tythes, which make men Priests, do so decay, One other Schisme will preach them quite away: Thou'lt near become it well, for I do find, Wit in a pulpit is quite out of kind, Thou canst not stand long, nor talk much, &amp; lowd, Nor thrash, nor couzen the admiring crowd, And (which is worse) though th'hast a face, and hand, A diamond ring, white glove, and clean lawn band, Able to tempt an Abbess, yet, I find, Thou canst not satisfie the Ladies mind. What ere the matter is. But thou art wise, And do'st best know thine own infirmities. Let me advize thee (Charles) be as thou art A Poet, so thou needst not care a ? For all the turnes of time: who ere did know, The Muses sequestred? or who can shew, That ever wit paid taxes, or was rated? Homer and Virgil nere were decimated: Ovid indeed was banished, but for that, Which, women say, you nere were ex'lent at. But (Charles) thou art unjusticed, I'm told, By one, who though not valiant, yet is bold. And that thou hast unfortunately met, The blinded scourge o'th' Western Bajazet. Thrown from the bench like Lucifer, and are In a fair way to be brought to th'bar. Ith' interim hang twixt both, as law doth name us, A billa-vera-man, or Ignoramus. But I can't learn wherefore it is, nor how, Though I've inqui'rd of both, perhaps nor thou, Some say tis for thy valour, which our time In a wise Magistrate, accounts a crime. If it be true thou hast ill luck in this, To have two vertues; and both plac'd a miss, To thwart each other; when thou shouldst have been A valiant Captain, wisdome was thy sin, And so uncaptain'd thee; and now the time, Calls for thy wisdom, valour is thy crime. And so unjustic'd thee; unlucky wretch! Two vertues want'st, yet has too much of each! Who ere compos'd thy mind plaid Babel-tricks, Brought lyme and timber, when he should bring bricks. But we live in an age so full of lies, I dare not trust my ears, nor scarce my eyes. I hope this is a lye too; but if true Tis an affliction (Charles) that is justly due, To thy desert; Our State holds it unfit, One man should be a Justice, and a wit. Go ask thy Lady, if it were ever known, A Man should be a Justice, and do none. Come be adviz'd by me, set out a book, In English too, were Justices may look, And learn their trade; let Presidents, of all Warrants and mittimuses, great and small, All Alehouse licenses, and other things, Which to the Justices instruction brings, Be there inserted; that the age to come, (The children of such men as can get some) May glorifie thy memory, and be Thy prayses trumpets to posterity. As from one looking glass, thrown on the ground, In every piece, a perfect face is found, So from thy ruines, all may plainly see, Legions of Justices as wise as thee. Now having taken all this pains to see Thy worship, and can find nor it, nor thee, Pray come to T.—bring thy beloved Sue, My Mat. and I will meet with her and you. And though my Mat's no Poet, you shall see, She'l sit and laugh with or at us, that be. I'll make thy Lady merry, and laugh untill, She break that belly, which thou canst not fill, Meantime pray give her one prolifick kiss, Tell her it comes from me, and if that miss, Give her another, and if both won't do, Do that with three which can't be done by two. If thou com'st not, I shall have cause to curse Tythes, like the lay'ty, and it may be worse. My sufferings are more, then theirs can be, They'l keep their tythes, but tythes keep thee from me. But if thou can'st not come, be sure to write, Don't rob at once, my hearing and my sight. If thou bring'st not thy body, send thy wit, For we must laugh with thee, or else at it. XIII. To C. S. Esquire. 1 Since we met last, my Brother dear, We've had such alterations here, Such turnings in and out. That I bing fat and breathless grown, My side, I meant to take was gone, E're I could turn about. 2 First I was for the King, and then He could not please the Parliament men, And so they went by the ears I was with other fools, sent out, And staid three dayes, but never fought Gainst King or Cavaliers. 3 And (Brother) as I have been told, You were for the Parliament of old; And made a mighty dust; And though perhaps you did not kill, You prov'd your self as valiant still, As ever they were just. 4 You were ingaged in that war, When C. R. fought against C. R. By a distinction new. You alwayes took that side that's right, But when Charles with himself did fight, Pray of which side were you? 5 Should I that am a man of law, Made use of such a subtile claw, In London or in Ex'ter. And be of both sides as you were People would count me then, I fear, A Knavish Ambodexter. 6 But since all sides so tottering be, It puzles wiser men then me, Who would not have it utter'd, What side to take they cannot tell. And I believe they know not well, Which side their bread is butter'd. 7 Here's fore-side, and here's back-side too, And two left sides, for ought I know, I can find ne're a right. I've been for th' midle twenty years, And will be still, for their appears Most Safety and delight. 8 But if the times think that too high, By creeping lower, I'll comply, And with their humour jump. If love at th' belly may not enter In an Italian may I'll venter, To love the very Rump. 9 So here's t'you (Charles) a Rubbers too't. Here's a Cast more, if that wont do't, Here's half a dozen more, and To every feather here's a glass, Nay rather then I'll let it pass, Here's a years healths before hand. 10 If loving it, and drinking to't, And making others drink to boot, Don't shew my good affection. I'll set down disaffected still, And let them all do what they will, Untill our next Election. 11 But I'm concern'd (me thinks) to find, Our Grandees turn with every wind, Yet keep like Corks above. They lived and dyed but two years since, With Oliver their pious Prince, Whom they did fear and love. 12 As soon as Richard did but raign, They liv'd and dy'd with him again. And swore to serve him ever, But when Sir Arthur came with's men, They liv'd and dy'd with him agen As if Dick had been never. 13 And when Prince Lambert turn'd them out, They liv'd and dy'd another bout, And vilified the Rump, And now for them they live and dye, But for the Divel by and by, If he be turn'd up trump. 14 Yet still they order us and ours, And will be called higher powers. But I will tell you what; Either these slaves forswear, and lye, Or if they did so often dye, They've more lives then a cat. 15 Let the times run, and let men turn, This is too wise an age to burn, Wee'l in our Judgment hover, Till tis agreed what we must be, In the interim take this from me. I'me thy eternal Lover. XIIII. To his Friend W. C. Dear Brother Will. thy dearer John and I, Now happy in each others company, Send thee this greeting, and do wish that we, By thy addition, may be made up three, Two make no sport, they can but sip and sip, Here's t'you, and thank you's no good fellowship. VVeer' Melancolly 'cause we drink alone, For John and I together spell but one. Three is the perfect number, that is able To difference a solitude from a rable. Here, if we mix with company, 'tis such As can say nothing, though they talk too much. Here we learn Georgicks, here the Bucolicks, Which buildings cheapest, timber, stone or bricks. Here's Adams natural Sons, all made of Earth, Earths their Religion, their discourse, their mirth, But on the sunday thoul'dst admire to see, How dirt is mingled with Divinity. Such disputations, writing, singing, praying, So little doing good, and so much saying; It tires us weak lung'd Christians, and I think, So much the more, 'cause ther's so little drink. And that so bad, that we with them are faign, To go to Church and sleep, and home again, Twice in a Sabbath, and to break the rest, VVith tedious repetitions, and molest, The Servants memories with such piteous stuff, As wisemen think once said's more then enough. Thus do we spend our time, &amp; meet with nothing, But what Creates our trouble, and our loathing. Come then away, leave Butchers, leave thy Lord Our Country here shall both, or more afford. Jack here's a Lord, a Prince, nay more a friend, He and his botles make the Vulgar bend. And if thou didst believe him, or know me, I am more butcher then thy two can be, If all these things won't make thee come away, I am resolv'd to thee-ward, if thoul't stay. Drink till I come, that I may find the mellow, 'Tis ten to one, thou'lt meet or make thy fellow. XV. To his Friend I. B. Upon his Tragedy. Thou may'st well wonder, and my self should be Dumb, if I should be dumb in praysing thee. Since I've occasion now to exercise, Sublimest thoughts, yet not hyperbolize. But since we two are Brothers, and subscribe. Both Volunteirs to the Poetick Tribe, I dare not do't, least any Dulman sayes, We, by consent, do one another praise. Yet dare applaud thy work, and thee in it, So good in language plot, and strength of wit. That none but thou can equall't. Not a line, But's thine 'cause good, &amp; good because 'tis thine. So that my duller sight, can hardly see Whether thou mak'st it exc'lent, or it thee. Let those, whose anvil-heads, beat all delight, Into a toil, at every line they write. Now, vail to thee and fairly yeild the bayes, Since all their work, compair'd with thine are playes. So far I like thy worth, that I should be Intic'd if possible to flatter thee. XVI. To a Potting Priest upon a quarrel. In 1643. I cannot choose but wonder, Mr. ? That we two wisemen, had so little wit, As without quarrel, Jealousies, or fears, Worse then the times, we two should go by th' ears. I marvel what inspired, this valour in you, Though you were weak, you'd something strong within you. 'Twas not your learning, neither can I think, That was your valour, but John D—strong drink. Love and good liquor, have a strong command T' make cowards fight, longer then they can stand. I need not aske your reason, for 'twas gone; Nor had you sence enough to feel you'd none. Was it to shew your Mistress you could fight. Living 'ith' woods, youl'd be an arrant Knight? That Lady may have cause enough to rue, That has no better Champion then you. You might have sav'd that labour, each man reads. You're a wild man both in your looks and deeds. By the wonders of your drinking men may'see, You are a Hero without Chevalry. You thought a duel, would your Mrs. please, But prov'd a Thraso, not a Hercules. I might have thought my self a worthy too, Because I tam'd a Monster, that is you. Your Zeal (me thought) was greatly kindled, That went to make a Pulpit of my head. Blame me not, though I strook, for I was vext, To be so basely handled, your like text; With subtile sophistry, that when you mist In words, you would confute me with your fist. But such weak sillogismes from you ran, As I could never read in Keckerman. That brain-aspiring drink, so much did nip us, You mistook Aristotle, for Aristippus. 'Twas this your brains with Proclamations fills, And twirles them like Don Quixots watermils. Your head that should be King, was now pull'd down, While that rebellions beer usurp'd your crown. And your Mechanick heels gaz'd on the stars, As if they went to turn Astronomers. Your legs were altogether for Commanding, And taught your foolish head more understanding. Your body so revers'd, did represent, (Being forked) our bicorned Government. Your wits were banished, and your brains were drown'd, VVhile your Calves-head lay center'd to the ground. Thus being black without, within a beast, I took you for a Tinker, not a Priest. In your next Sermon, let your audience hear, How you can preach damnation to strong beer. I have returned your knife, at your demand, But if I've put a sword t'a mad mans hand, Let me advice you, when you fight again, Fight with a worse, or be a better man. XVII. To his Friend Mr. VV. H. upon the death of his hawke. What will you suffer thus your hawke to dye? And shan't her name live in an Elegy? It shall not be, nor shall the people think, Wee've so few Poets, or so little drink. And if there be no sober brain to do it, I'll wet my Muse, and set my self unto it. I have no Gods, nor Muse to call upon, Sir Johns strong barrel is my Helicon. From whence uncurbed streams of tears shall flow, And verse shall run, when I my self can't go. Poor bird, I pitty this thy strange disaster, That thou shoul'st thus be murthred by thy master. Was it with salt? I'm sure he was not fresh, Or wa'st thy trusting to an arme of flesh? Or cause 'twas darksome did his eye-sight fail, Meeting a Post, he took it for a Rayle. And yet I wonder how he mis'd his sight, For though the night was dark, his head was light. And though he bore thee with a mighty hand, Thou needs must fall, when he himself can't stand. 'Tis but our common lot, for we do all Sometimes, for want of understanding fall. But thou art serv'd aright, for when th' had'st flown, What ere thou tookst, thou tookst to be thy own. And 'tis but Justice, that each plundring knave, That such a life do lead, such death should have. Rejoyce you Partridge, and be glad ye Rayles. For the Hawks tallons, are as short's your tayles. If all the Kingdomes bloody foes, as she, Would break their necks, how joyfull should we be. Well at her burial, thus much I will tell, In spite of schism, her bells shall ring a knell. XVIII. To his School Master Mr. VV. H. upon his Poem call'd Conscientiæ accusatricis Hypotyposis. When I read your work, and thought upon How lively you had made description. Of an accusing conscience, and did see, How well each limn did with th' Archtipe agree. I wonder'd how you could lim't out so well, Since you b' experience can't its horrour tell. Trust me, Il'd praise it, but that I suppose, My praise would make it more inglorious, In love to th' work and work-man I thought meet, To make your verses stand on English feet. But whe're well done or ill, I here submit, Unto your censure, both my self and it. I'm man, I'm young, unlearn'd, and thereupon I know, I cannot boast perfection. In fetter'd tasks, wherein the fancies tide, Do what one can, the lustre won't abide. No Ideoms kiss so well, but that there is Between some phrases some Antithesis. VVhat ere is good, in each unpolish'd line, I count as yours, the faults alone are mine. I wish each foot and line, as strong, and true; As my desire to love, and honour you. XIX. To his Friend T. S Tom. Since thou didst leave both me and this town, The sword is got up, and the lawes tumbled down. Those eager disputes between Harrington and Wren. At length have inspired the Red-coated Men. Whose sides, not their heads, do wear the Lex terræ. With which they will rule us until we be weary. We know not whose highest (what ere people brawle,) Whether Wallingford-house or Westminster Hall. You made a contest neither pulpit nor tub-like, What's fittest, a Monarchy or a Republick. But Desborough sayes, that Schollers a fool, That advances his pen against the warr-tool. We have various discourses and various conjectures, In Taverns, in Streets, in Sermons, and Lectures. Yet no man can tell what may hap in the close, Which are wiser, or honester, these men or those. But for my part I think 'tis in vain to contest, I sit still and say, he that's strongest is best. The World keeps a round, that original sin, That thrust some people out, drawes other folkes in. They have done they did not know what, &amp; now, Some think that they do not know what they may do. But State matters (Tom) are too weighty &amp; high, For such mean private persons as thou art, and I. We will not our Governours calling invade, VVe'le mind our own good, let them follow their trade. Lanch forth into th' Pulpit much learning will be, A hinderance to thy Divinity. 'Tis better to mind what will cloath ye, and feed, ye Then those empty titles of M. A. and D. D. I have one thing to beg, and I won't be deni'd, You must once more mount Pegasus, and you must ride. Ore the County of D. whose praise must b'exprest, In a poem to grace our next County feast. VVhich will be next term, 'twas what I design'd, But want wit and time to do't to my mind. Thou hast Subject and wit, if thou hast but a will, Thou maist make a Poem, next that Coupers-hill. Remember thy promise, to send me my book, VVith a copy of thine, for which I doe look; And let not a Letter come hether to me, But fraighted with Poems, and written by thee. And I out of gratitude shall take a care, To make a return of our City ware. I'le vex thee no more with this paltry rythme, For fear it should make the mis-pend thy time. And so I have this Apology for't, Though it bee'nt very sweet, it shall be prety short. XX. An Epistle to the Meritoriously Honorable Lord Chiefe Justice of the Kings bench. Great Sir, and Good! beloved, and obey'd! To whose great worth, honours not giv'n but paid. To whose great love, and knowledg we all owe, All that we have of law, and what we know; Who with strong reason, from the factious clawes, Of wilfull fools, redeem'd our sacred lawes. Full twenty years have I a Servant been, To this Profession, I live by and in. Eight years a Master, and in all this space, Have nothing done that mis-became my place; Nor have my actions been Derogatory, Unto my Clients profit, or the glory. Of this renowned Court, and therefore I Now humbly beg to be at liberty. Justice, and reason both command, that he Who serv'd, so long, should at the last be free. For this I serv'd, for this our Nation fought, And pray'd, and paid so much; nor do I doubt, T'obtain my wish herein, could I but find, Desert in me proportion'd to your mind. The benefit o'th' Clergy I desire, That I may be admitted of that Quire. Who their own Pleas, in their names enrowl, And may perform my place without controul. My Lord, you've power and will to do't, and, though I am not worthy, if you think me so, Your Lordships test can constitute me that, Which my abilities can near reach at; My comfort is, 'tis what you don't deny, To some that read and write as bad as I. And there's a kindness which belongs to such, As having little worth, beg where ther's much. Cæsar that valiant General was ador'd More for his liberal hand, then for his Sword. And your great Archetipe his Highness does, Derive more honour from the mouths of those, Whom he hath gratifi'd, then by the death, Of those his conquering sword depriv'd of breath. Freedomes a Princely thing to give, 'tis that Which all our lawes do stand for, and aim at. And 'twill be some addition to your fame, When I with tongue, and pen enlarg'd, proclaim. 'Mong all your Noble acts, you made a room, In your great heart, for ? XXI. A new years gift presented to the same. My Lord, Did I not find it by experience true; Beggars are many, but Thanksgivers few. I had not dar'd t'envade your eye, with this, Most gratulation whose ambition is, But to be pardon'd, and the faults to smother, VVith this which were committed by the other; Yet since 'tis gratitude, it may please you, If not as good, yet as 'tis strange and new. Great Atlas of our lawes and us, whose will, Is alwayes active, back'd by unmatch'd skill; To rule the Nation, and instruct it too, And make all persons live, as well as know. Though being among the undiscerning throng, You sufferd once, you acted all along. Your sufferings did but like the Martyrs flame, Advance your Person, and exalt your name. Disclos'd your vertues, from their sullen Orbe, Make your gold shine, which was pure gold before. Your Noble soul tells us from whence you came, You've both the Brittish Nature and the name; By your example, you instruct us what Our Grandsires were, and what they aimed at. Ere the Fantastick French, or selvish Dutch, VVere grafted on our stocks, our souls were such. As your's is now; Now we by you may see, VVhat once we were, what now we ought to be. Great Men, great favours, to great men repay, VVith great rewards, but I can only say. Your Lordship, your great kindnesses hath thrown, On one, that can return, or merit none. But you must pay, and thank your felf for me, VVith your own goodness; That vast treasury, That found you love so generous and immense, To cast on me, can find you Recompence. A gift of worth my fortune can't bring forth, Proportion'd to your kindness, or your worth. Let me send what I can, it will not be Enough for you, though't be too much for me. VVhat more to do or say, I cannot tell, Much I can't do, nor can say much, and well; But what I cannot do, I will desire, And what I can't express, I shall admire. May this new year be prosperous! may each hour, Bring you new blessings, in a plenteous shour! May Heaven still smile upon you, and still bless, All that you do, and all that you possess! May you live long and flourish too, that I VVhen I need succour may know where to fly, And find supplies! May all your actions be, As beneficial t'all, as this to me, That when you dye (great pitty 'tis you should) Th' whole land may mourn, not as your great, but good. And though I have not ransac'k Sea, and Shore, To make you richer, then you were before, I hope this grateful, though but rude address, May please you more, though it hath cost me less. XXII. To his Friend R. H. Esquire. Sir, Though I woed you not in verse, or prose, To make my name, and me more glorious. By being your Clark, the work is done, I find, Not that I'm worthy on't, but you are kind, Therefore these lines address themselves to you, Not given freely t'you, but paid as due; And that they may your kind acceptance win, They've sack (their common badge) with them and in. And I presume, without much scruple, you May drink old sack. Although the year be new. But though I am not rich enough to send, Gifts fit for you t' accept; nor do intend. T' enrich Peru: nor think it fit to give, Our betters that, by which our selves should live. This will, I hope, your candid nature move, Cause I give freely what I dearly love; And I believe 'tis true, what I've been told; You love good sack, as well as your partner gold. I know not whether you'l like this or no, But if it be not good, my will is so. May it prove excellent! and may all those, That drink it freely, be ingenious. That is be found or made so! to yours and you, May this year prove as prosperous as new May we live quiet, and lay by our swords. And have no more lawless and boistrous Lords! May the law stand! may Justice rule the roast, One sober Judge rules better then an hoast. And be assur'd this truth you'l ever find; I'le be as dutifull as you are kind. Nor shall you in your Rolls find out a Man, Will serve you more then I, though many can. XXIII. To his Friend J. H. 1 If thou canst fashion no excuse, To stay at home, as 'tis thy use, VVhen I do send for Thee. Let neither sickness, way, nor rain, VVith fond delusions thee detain, But come thy way to me. 2 Hang such a sickness that has power, To seize on thee at such an hour, When thou shouldst take thy pleasure. Go give thy Doctor half a Fee, That it may never trouble thee, Untill thou art at leisure. 3 VVe have a Cup of Sider here, That scornes that Common strumpet, Beer And such dull drinks as they're. Their potions made of Hops and Mault, Can only make our fancies hault, This makes them quick as ay're. 4 Ceres with Bacchus dares compare, And swears her fruits the liquor are, That Poets so implore. A sip of Sack may work a verse, But he that drinks a bowle of Her's, Shall thunder out a score. 5 To morrow morning come away, Friday weele' vote a happy day, In spite of Erra Pater. And bring with you a spark or twain, Such as will drink, and drink again, To treat about the matter. XXIIII. To a Gentleman that fell sick of the small Pox. When he should be married. Sir, When you view these cheker'd lines and see, How (bate the colour) like your face they be. You'll think this sheet to be your looking glass, And all these spots, the Eccoes of your face. VVherein Disease and Love their field have pight, To try which is more lovely Red, or White. Like our late Souldiers, who more rage did show, Unto the place that fed them, then their foe. Sickness, loves Rivall, envying the place, VVhere Cupid chose to pitch his tents, your face, VVent to write foul, but Cupid made it prove, Spite of his spite, the alphabet of love. So as they strove, love serv'd him in his trim, For as that set on you, this set on him. And love that conquers all things, soon made known, To him a burning, greater then his own. Accurst disease, durst thou come, crawling hither To separate, whom Heaven had joyn'd together? Had'st thou no time to vent thy rage, but this, When swelling hopes did dawn towards their bliss? I'th interregnum 'twixt desires and joyes. The cursed Vigil of blest holy dayes! What pitty 'tis that face where love has been, So oft, so proud to play so sweetly in, By thy dire hand should be ore-turned thus, As to be made a Campus Martius, Wherein the angry York and Lancaster, New-vampe and do retrive their musty stir? As if the Red rose and the white would be, Where ere they met, still at Antipathy; A face that was as clear as day, as bright, Should bud with stars like an enamell'd night, Your sickness meant to turn Astronomer, Your face the Heaven, and every spot a Star. Or else would write an Almanack, and raise, By those red Letters, nought but holy-dayes. Were it your Butlers face, a Man would think, They had but been new boylings of the drink; Or had his nose been such, one would have swore, 'Twere red with anger, 'cause he'd drink no more. Or had your keeper such, hee'ld sell it all For harts-horn to make halfts of knives withall. Or if your Cooks were such, how it would fit, To grate your ginger, or nutmegs with it? But why on your face? what was his design? Was it to break the Hymeneal twine, That was half twisted? Tush! hee's much mistook, Your love was past the criss-cross of a look; And your affections are of riper age, Then now to gaze on beauties title page. Or barely dwell upon the face, those toyes Are Oceand in the hopes of future joyes. Then blush no more, but let your Mrs. know, They're but Love-letters written on your brow, Etch'd by th' engravers hand, there she may see, That beautie's subject to mortality. How frail a thing it is, how vain t'adore it, VVhat fools are they that love or marry for it; And that this sickness which hath curb'd you, is But the sad prologue to your future bliss. An Ember-week or Lent, which alwayes falls, As fasting-eves before your festivals. 'Twill make you prize your joy the more when't comes, Usher'd along by tedious Martyrdomes. How acceptable is a plenteous boul, When 'tis carowsed by a thirsty soul! So have I seen the winter strip the trees, To fit them for their vernal Liveries! And cloth th' old Earth in gray, nip every thing, Before it rowles it self into the spring. So has black night begot a gray ey'd day, So Sol does rout conspiring clouds with Ray; As through this sickness does your joyes come on, And gulfe your hopes in firm fruition. When your red-rose, clubs with your Ladies white, And as the Ancient flowers did unite, Your happiness will swell, and you will prove The Gemini of joy, as now of Love. These things I guess not by your face, I find Your front is not the Index of your mind. Yet by your Physnomy, thus much is ment, You are not spotles though you're innocent Sir if these verses go as halting pace, They stumble in the vallies of your face. XXV. To his Friend Mr. I. B. being at London in the Authors retirement. Though we are now analy'sd; and can't find, How to have mutual presence, but in mind; I'm bold to send you this, that you may know, Though you're above, yet I do live below. Though I've no bags, that are with child with gold, And though my fireless chymnies catch the cold. For want of great revenues, yet I find I've what's as good as all, a sated mind. I neither mony, want, nor have I store, I have enough to live, and ask no more. No tiptoed turret, whose aspiring brow, Looks down and scornes the humble roofes below; My cottage lyes beneath the thunders harmes, Laughs at the whipers of the winds, or stormes. My rooms are not inlined with Tapistry; But ragged walls where a few books may ly. I slight the silks, whose ruffling whispers pride, And all the worlds Tautologies beside. My limbs inhabite but a Country dress, Not to adorn, but cover nakedness. My famili's not such, whose gentry springs, Like old Mecænasses, from Grandsire Kings. I've many kinred, yet my friends are few, Those few not rich, and yet more rich then true. I've but a drachme of learning, and less wit; Yet that's enough to fright my wealth from it. As if those two seldom or never meet, But like two Generals that with bullets greet. I study to live plenteously, though scant; How not to have, yet not to care, nor want. Wee've here no gawdy feminines to show, As you have in that great Seraglio; He that weds here, lyes cloyster'd in a maid, A Sepulcher where never man was laid. Ours are with Load-stone touch'd, and never will, But right against their proper pole, ly still. Yours like Hell-gates do alwayes open lye, Like hackney Jades they stand at livery. Like treasuries where each throwes his mite; Gulphs of contraries, at once both dark and light. Where who so enters, is like gold refind; Passing through fire, where Moloch sets enshrind, And offers up a whole burnt sacrifize, To pacifie those fiery Dieties. I have no farr-fetch'd dear-bought delicates, Whose vertues prized only by their rates. No fanci'd Kick-shawes that would serve 't invite, To a fourth course the glutted appetite. Hunger's my Cook, my labour brings me meat, Which best digests, when it is sawc'd with sweat. They that have plurifies of these about them, Yet do but live, and so do I without them. I can sit in my study soon, or late, And have no Troopers quarrel with my gate; Nor break the peace with it; whose innocence Stands only guarded in its own defence. No debts to sue for, and no coyn to lend, No cause to fear my foe, nor flight my friend. Yet there is one thing which me thinks I han't, And I have studyed to supply that want, 'Tis the Synopsis of all misery; 'Tis the tenth want (Dear Friend) the want of Thee. How great a joy 'twould be, how great a bliss, If we could have a Metampsycosis! May we once more enjoy our selves, for neither Is truly blest, till we are blest together. XXVI. An elgy on a Lady that dyed before her intended Nuptials. Among the train of mourners, whose swolne eyes Wallow in tears of these sad obsequies, Admit me as a cypher here to come, Who though am nothing, yet can raise a summe, And truly I can mourne as well as they, Who're clad in sable weeds, though mine as gray. Excuse me Sir, passion will swell thats pent, Thank not my tears, I cannot but lament To see a Lady ready for your bed To death imbraces yeild her mayden head. And that Angellick Corps that should have been A Cabinet to lodge your Jevvels in, Should now b' inbalm'd with dust, &amp; made a prey To the happy wormes, who may call that day On which her lims unto their lot did fall, Your sad Solemnities, their Festival; Should I not mourn, I could not pay the due, Of tears to her or sympathy to you. For death did slay you both when she did dye, So who writes one's must write both's Elegy. She was too good for you, she was too high, A wife for Angels to get Angels by. In whom there was as much Divinity, And excellence, as could in woman be: Whom you and all did love, and did suppose, To be an Angel in a mortalls cloaths; But Heaven to undeceive you let you know, By her mortality she was not so. XXVII. On the great cryer at VVestminster-Hall. When the great Cryer in that greater room, Calls Faunt-le-roy, and Alex-and-er Brome. The people wonder (as those heretofore, When the dumb spake) to hear a Cryer roar. The kitling crue of Cryers that do stand, VVith Enuches voyces, squeaking on each hand, Do signifie no more, compar'd to him, Then Member Allen did to patriot Pim. Those make us laugh, while we do him adore, Theirs are but pistol, his mouth's Canon bore. Now those fame-thirsty spirits that endevour, To have their names enlarg'd, and last for ever, Must be Atturneys of this Court, and so His voyce shall like fames lowdest trumpet blow Their names about the World, and make them last, VVhile we can lend an ear, or he a blast. XXVIII. To the memory of that loyal patriot Sir I. Cordel Kt. Thus fell the grace and glory of our time, Who durst be good when goodness was a crime. A Magistrate that justly wore his gown While England had a King, or King a Crown; But stoutly flung it off, when once he saw Might knock down right, and lust did justle law. His soul scorn'd a Democracy, and wou'd, No longer stay, then while the Kingdome stood; And when that fled, his follow'd it, to be, Joyn'd to his King i'th Hieromonarchy. XXIX. A Dialogue. Q. What made Venus strike her Son? A. Cause he lost his bow and quiver. Q. Where is his bow and quiver gone? A. To my Mistress without doubt. Q. Prithee how came that about? A. She did but ask, and he did give her; For being blind, he easly ers, And knew not his Mothers face from hers. Chorus. Oh blame him not for what he did do; Which of us all would not err so too? XXX. To his Mistress lodging in a room where the Sky was painted. When (my Diviner soul) I did of late, In thy fair chamber, for thy presence wait, Looking aloft, (Thou know'st my look is high, Else I'd nere dare to court Thee) I did spy. Sun, Moon and Stars, by th' painters art appear At once all Culm'nant in one hemisphear; My small Astrology made me suppose, Those Symptomes made the room prodigious. Old time. (I thought) was crmpt and night and day Both monosyllabled, to make me stay; Heed broke his steps of dayes and hours that he Might rowle himself into eternity. The Sun, as tyred, with the course he ran, Center'd himself in the Meridian: And 'cause 'twas there, I could not think it night, Nor durst I call it day, 'cause 't gave no light. I found the cause, and ceased to admire; Thy eyes had stolne his light, my heart his fire. And that's the cause why Sun &amp; Moon look'd dim, Thy brighter face out luster'd her, and him. But (which increas'd my wonder) I could see, No Meteor portend this prodigy; Comets all winck'd at this, nor could I spy One blazing starr, but my portentive eye. But as I muse'd, what Omen this should be, They all stood still, as much amaz'd at me. The wandring Planets had forgot to vary; Gazing on me, because all stationary. Envying thy beauty, they're together gon, To make a perfect constellation. And their conjunctions t'imitate our lips, Was but a loving kiss, not an Eclipse; Sol drawes a Regiment of stars, to be Tapers to light thee into bed to me. Yet could not shine, untill they were inspir'd, By the same flames, by which my heart was fir'd. Come then lye down, do thou withdraw thy light, They'l be to please us a perpetual night. Sol shall be Cupid, blind, and thou his mother, And as wee've marr'd one Sun, we'l get another. XXXI. A new years gift. The season now requires a Man should send Some worthy present to his worthier Friend. And I (though poor in purse) do wear a heart, That is ambitious to perform a part In celebration of this new born day, And having nothing to present, I'll pray This year may be to me, as well as you, So much more blest then tother, as more new. And in it so much happiness abound, To turn us all to good, yet not turn round. And may the Sun, that now begins t' appear, I'th Horizon to usher in the year, Melt all those fatuous Vapors, whose false light Purblinds the World, &amp; leads them from the right; And may our Sol like that rise once again, Mounted triumphant in a prosperous raign. May all those Phaetons that spite o'th crown, Would guide his chariot, tumble head-long down: So shall the Land with happiness be crown'd, When men turn right, and only years turn round. XXXII. On the Queens going beyond Sea. When on the watry World, our glorious Queen 'Gan to be toss'd, as on the land sh' had been, The joyfull waters did begin t' aspire, And would transelement themselves to fire. And ever since it has been hard to swear Whether the Earth, or vvater highest were. The late scorn'd Sea will now it selfe prefer, Bearing the best that earth could boast of; Her, When first she lanch'd, th'ambitious waves no more VVould kiss the lips of their oft washed shoar, But with united motion all did rise To bear the ship; that her, to kiss the skies. The ship, like Noahs ark, did float about, And kept the waters that would enter, out. For were the vvorld redrown'd, what good has been In it, in her Epitomiz'd is seen. The sturdy billowes, if they did arise, VVere check'd by th' power of her majestick eyes. VVhen ever any to rebell appears, For grief it did dissolve it self to tears; The moving compass had forgot to stir, In stead o'th Northpole pointed still at her; At which the Pilot wondering, he spies Two North-poles culminant at once, her eyes. No marvail then, the compass pointed thither, For her magnetick soul drawes all things with her. The Ocean scorn'd Neptunes tridentine sway, And would no more a King but Queen obey. Nay Neptune thought she had a Venus been, Sprung from the frothy Sea to be his Queen. And whispering Zeophyrus if he did stir, 'Twas not to blovv, but to suck breath from her, The Mariners, vvhen ere she breathed, thought That precious Amber 'bout the ship did float. Widdow Arabia did begin to grieve, To see her Phænix on the waters live. The Semi-lunar Dolphin having seen Her face, vvould straight salute her as the Queen. The amorous Syrens did altogether throng, Hoping t'entice her to them by a song. Her brow (as though command were written there) Did more sway them, then all their voyces her. The little fishes met and did rejoyce, Dancing to th' musick of the Syrens voyce. All in their several postures strove t' express Hovv much her presence vvould their mansions bless. All praying her to stay, but all in vain, At length (though loth) they landed her again. The shoar's a Paradise, where she was driven, And (but her Charles lack'd her)'t had been Heaven XXXIII. Upon his Mare stoln by a Trooper. VVhy let her go, I'll vex my self no more, Lest my heart break, like to my stable door. Twas but a Mare; if she be gone, she's gone; 'Tis not a Mare that I do stand upon. 'Now by this Cross I am so temperate grown, I'll bridle nature, since my mare is gone. I have a little learning, and less wit, That wealth is sure, no theif can pilfer it. All worldly goods are frail, and variable, Yea very Jades are now become unstable. Riches they say have wings, my mare had so, For though she had legs, yet she could hardly go. But thieves and fate have such a strong command, To make those go, which have no feet to stand. She was well skil'd in writing Elegies, And every mile writes, Here my Rider lyes. Now since I've nere a beast to ride upon, Wou'd I might nere go, my verse shall run. I'll mount on Pegasus, for hee's so poor, From thief or true-man, one may ride secure. I would not rack invention for a curse, To plague the Thief, for fear I make him worse. I would not have him hang'd, for that would be, Sufficient for the law, but not for me. In charity I wish him no more pain, But to restore me home my Mare again. And cause I would not have good customes alter, I wish who has the Mare, may have the halter. XXXIV. Upon riding on a tired horse. Twas hot, and our Olympick Charioter, Limbeck'd the body of the Traveller, Which to prevent, I like the Sun did go; He was on horse-back, I on horse-back too. Thus my all conquering name-sake us'd to ride His stallion as I did mine bestride: So on we go to view the desolation Of that half plague to our distressed Nation. But my horse was so superstitious grown, He would fall down, and worship every stone. Nay he in reverence to each holy place, Was often seen to fall upon his face. And had I been inclin'd to Popishness, I needed have no other cross but this. Within a mile or two without command, Do what I could, this Jade would make a stand. I prais'd him, thinking glory were a spur To prick him on, all would not make him stir. All worldly things do post away we know, But yet my horse would neither run nor go. What everlasting Creature should this be, That all things are less permanent then he! So long I kick'd, the people did suppose, The arm-less man had beat a drum with's toes. But though a march or an alar'm I beat, The senceless horse took all for a retreat. The peoples jeers mov'd me to no remorse, No more then all my kicks did move my horse Had Phaetons horses been as mine is, They Needed no reynes, they'l never run away. I wish'd for old Copernicus to prove That while we both stood still, the Earth would move Oh for an Earthquake, that the hills might meet To bring us home, though we mov'd not our feet All would not do, I was constrain'd to be, The bringer up of a foot company. But now in what a wofull case were I, If like our horsemen I were put to fly. wish all cowards (if that be too much) Half of our horsemen, which I'll swear are such, In the next fight when they begin to flee, They may be plagu'd with a tyr'd horse like me XXXV. To his Friend. I. B. Thou thinkst that I to thee fully known; Yet thoult not think how powerfull I am grown. I can work miracles, and when I do Think on thy worth, think thee a wonder too. Thy constant love and lines in verse and prose, Makes me think thee and them miraculous. My self am from my self, both here and there I Suppose my self grown an Ubitiquary. We are a miracle, and tis with us As with John Baptist and his Lazarus. I thou, and thou art I, and 'tis a wonder, That we both live, and yet both live asunder. Come then, let's meet agen; for untill we Unite, the times can't be at unity. But if this distance must still interpose, Betvveen my eye and thee, yet let us close In mind, and though our necks by-forked grovvn, Spread-Eagle like, yet let our Breasts be one. XXXVI. Translated out of Perseus. I don't remember I did dip, In the Caballine spring my lip; Nor on tvvo-top'd Pernassus sleep, That thence I should a Poet creep. The pale Pyrene and Helicon, I for those men vvill let alone, T'vvhose brovves the rambling Ivy's cling; Yet I a clown, my verses bring To th' Muses altars. Who did shovv The Parrat ?????, vvho the crow Of old vvith hollovv voyce to prate? Or pies our vvords to imitate? Arts Master, Need, vvhich wit bestovves; This Artist makes us come to those VVords vvhich our Nature us denies, Make crowes turn Poets, and the Pies Turn Poetresses that can sing Svveet verses from the Pegasean spring. XXXVII. Upon the miscarrier of Letters betwixt his Friend and him; An Execration. And why to me? dull scanner of the ground, Was there no other pack-horse to be found, To bear the weight of such a grand abuse, But only I? I'le wake my sleeping Muse, And send her post to th'black abyss of Hell To fetch me curses, curses dyre and fell. I'l mount on Pegasus, and make him go, From Friend to Friend, as swift as thou art slow. Perfidious Traytor! could thine impious hands Dare to miscarry, what true love commands? Had it been newes, or pamphlets, or the rude Inventions of the cock-brain'd multitude, New modells of Religion, or the false, Ly-legends which we here call Diurnals; Had there been treason against the King or State, They deserv'd thine, &amp; thou hadst scap'd my hate. But these were embassies of souls that be So pure, they dare dispute vvith purity. That will not club with treason, nor betroth, There souls to schisme, but are estrang'd from both. Had they been complements or th' adulterate froth Of inckhorn wits, t' had nere incens'd my wroth. For 'tis but reason such vain toyes as they are, Should be dissolv'd to their first matter, Air. Had they been meerly issues of the brain, And had been lost, that might to work again. But when the heart's engag'd, what pitty 'tis A child of that should ever fare amiss? Hadst thou but known how sweet those accents were, How full of love thou would'st have took more care. Why did'st thou go to stop that blessed Tine That was to be 'twixt their aspects and mine? Do'st thou not know what good, what blest effects The Land will have from such benigne aspects? Alas when Mercury doth meet with Jove, Lilly can tell thee their portents are love. I'm loth to study for some new found curse, For fear I should be heard, and thou be worse. First for thy horses would their teeth may be Greas'd at each Inne, which none may help but me. May all their old diseases never fail, Their feet have scabs doubled for every nail, That thou may'st like Tom. Long for ever go, And ne're come where thou art assign'd unto, And so may'st ne're be trusted with a pack, Unless of plagues, and may those break thy back. May'st thou ne're carry loyal letters more? But Pocky songs betwixt a Pimp and's whore. But when th' hast sweat and travel'd all the day, May'st thou have neither meat, drink, bed nor pay. May all the way be strew'd with Downes his men, And thou escaping one, may'st meet with ten. And may they take thy horses and thy store, And bang thy sides because thou hast no more. May all these plagues unite that they may be As great a plague to thee, as thou to me. XXXVIII To his Mistris. Your pardon Lady; by my troth I err, I thought each face a painted Sepulcher, That wore but beauty on't; I did suppose, That outward beauty had been ominous. And that t' had been so opposite to wit, As it nere wisdome met, nor vertue it. Your face confutes me, and I do begin To know my errour, and repent my sin. For on those Rosie cheeks I plainly see And read my former thoughts deformity. I could believe Hyperbolies, and think That praise to low that flowes from pen and ink; That you're all Angel; when I look on you, I'm forc'd to think the Rampant't fictions true. Nay I dare swear (though once I did abhor it) That Men love Women, and have reason for it. The Lapidadies now shall learn to set Their Diamonds in gold, and not in Jet. The Proverb's crost, for now a man may find A beauteous face th' Index of such a mind. How I oculd praise you, and your worth display, But that my ravish'd pen is forc'd to stay; And when I think t'express your purer fashion; My expressions turn to stupid Admiration. Natures perfection! She by forming thee? Proves she has now infallibility. You're an Enchiridion, whom Heav'n did print, To copy by, with no errata in't. You're my Urania, nay within you be The Muses met in their Tertrinity. Else how could I turn Poet, and retain, My banish'd Muse into my thoughts again! See what your wit, see what your beauty can; T' make a Poet's more then t' make a Man; I've wit b'infusion, nay I've beauty too, I think I'm comely if you think me so. Add to your vertues love, and you may be A wife for Jove, pray let that Jove be me. XXIX. To his Mistris married to another. Married? and I not dead? it cannot be, Is nothing certain but uncertainty? Can truth it self prove false? I should as soon Have thought the Sun vary'd into a Moon, And that the Poles that nere knew how to vary, Turn'd Planets now, and grow unstationary. But Sol has chang'd his course, and we all know Those we call Poles, are planetary too You whom I thought a Goddess, now I see, Are but a woman, by y'r inconstancy. See what the covetous love of wealth can do, It makes fair Ladies false and foolish too. I could be sorry now, or vext, or worse; But wrath or sorrow will enlarge my curse. That anger's foolish and that sorrow's vain, That's us'd for that which can't be had again. But what's this thing call'd marriage? must you be Cloyster'd by that from all society? Must only he enjoy you as a ride? And by his feast, famish the whole World beside? You only did proclaim, when you did wed, That both together meant to go to bed. What need all this ado? can't we (my hony) Do the same thing without Ceremony, Or proclamation? where two hearts agree, Marriage is but a superfluity. Nature did ne're intend (without all doubt) To hang such a Jewel only in his snowt. Nor were you made only for one Mans food, Not for the private, but the common good. You have my heart, and do but lend me thine, I'l give the Priest the lye, and say th' art mine. XL. On the turn-coat Clergy. That Clergy-men are changeable, and teach That now 'gainst which they will to morrow preach, Is an undoubted truth; but that in this Their variation they do ought amiss, I stedfastly deny; The World we see Preserves it self by mutability; An by an imitation each thing in it Preserves it self by changing every minute; The Heavenly orbes do move, and change, and ther's The much admired musick of the sphears. The Sun, the Moon, the Stars do alwayes vary, The times turn round still, nothing stationary. Why then should we blame Clergymen, that do Because they're Heav'nly, like the Heavens go? Nay th' Earth it self, on which we tread (they say) Turnes round and's moving still; then vvhy not they? Our bodies still are changing from our birth, Till they return to their first matter, Earth. VVe dravv in air, and food, that air and food Incorporates and turns our flesh and blood. Then vve breath out our selves in svveat, and vent Our flesh and blood by use, and excrement, VVith such continuall change, that none can say, He's the same man that he was Yesterday. Besides, all Creatures cannot choose but be By much the worse for their stability. For standing pools corrupt, while running springs Yeild sweet refreshment to all other things. The highest Church-things oftenest change, we know, The weather-cock that stands o'th top does so. The bells when rung in changes best do please, The Nightingall, that ministrel of the trees, Varies her note, while the dull Cucko sings Only one note, no auditory brings. Why then should we admire our Levites change, Since tis their nat'ral motion? 'Tis not strange To see a fish to swim, or Eagle fly; Nor is their Protean mutability More worth our wonder, but 'tis so in fashion, It merits our applause, and imitation. But I conclude, least while I speak of change, I shall too far upon one subject range. And so become unchangeable, and by My practice give my doctrine here the lye. XLI. To his Friend Mr. I. VV. on his Translation of the Romance, call'd The innocent imposture. From forrain soyl, He at the first did spring, Whom conquest crown'd, and custom kept our King. And from the same, this fancy, whom this pen Has of an Alien made a Denizen. Dispute who dares: The issue of the brain Admits a transplantation, like the train That buds with Stars; and in this do hit, The two fac Totums, Monarchy and wit. The industrious Merchant glutted with the things That are produced by our mother springs, Ransacks the Ocean, trafficking for more And rarer beauties from the forraign shore; And makes our happiness not only be nnecessaries, but variety. So thou with equal diligence hast gone To fetch the merchandize of Helicon. Not but that wit and fancy here will be, A native and staple commodity. Or that composing stories and Romances, Were only entayl'd to wits that live beyond Seas. But as in dearth, we oft supply our store, From those that we perhaps reliev'd before. So now when rare Inventions and immense, Are parch'd and shrunk up into hardly sence, For want of due rewards, that shou'd distill, From these new Tympanies, and we call hills, Yo're fain to forage for what ere must be, Beyond Diurnals or a Mercury. Yet be'nt discouraged; for here's no excise, Nor custom paid on these commodities. And he that trades in wit by Sea or Land, Needs not a convoy, fears no Rocks nor Sand. This traffick is secure against the thump Of Spains armado or the Belgick Trump, And the proceed on't, though in this mad Nation, Is free from plunder, and from sequestration. I do commend thy choice too, for of all The sciences, this is most cordial, Presenting notions to the curious mind, Of what below we never see nor find. Herein do differ History, and this; This shews what ought to be, that shews what is; Ungratefull we, if that we should receive This precious Jewel, and should nothing give To Thee or to its Author; Therefore I Offer these lines to both your memory, To testifie my thanks, though not my skill; What's so well done, must not be praysed ill. But I nick-name my duty, when I say I give, or offer, when I only pay. XLII. A Satyre on the Rebellion. Urge me no more to sing, I am not able To raise a note, songs are abominable. Yea Davids psalmes do now begin to be Turn'd out of Church, by hymnes extempore. No accents are so pleasant now as those That are Cæsura'd through the Pastors nose. I'll only weep our misery and ruth, I am no Poet, for I speak the truth. Behold a self against it self doth fight, And the left hand prevails above the right. The grumbling guts, the belly of the State, Unthankfull for the wholsom food they ate, Belch at their head, and do begin to slight The Cates, to which they had an appetite. They long for kick-shawes, and new fangled dishes, Not which all love, but which each fancy wishes. Behold a glorious Phœbus tumbling down, While the rebellious bards usurpe the Crown. Behold a Teem of Phaetons aspire To guide the Sun, and set the World on fire. All goes to wrack, and it must needs be so, When those would run, that know not how to go. Behold a lawfull Soveraign to whose mind Dishonesty's a stranger, now confind. To the Anarchick pow'r of those whose reason Is flat rebellion, and their truth is Treason. Behold the loyal Subjects pill'd and poll'd. And from Algere to Tunis bought and sold. Their Goods sequestred by a legal stealth, The private robb'd t' uphold the Common-wealth. And those the only plunderers are grown Of others States, that had none of their own. Robbers no more by night in secret go, They have a Licence now for what they do. If any to the rulers do complain, They know no other godliness but gain. Nor give us any plaister for the sore Of paying much, but only paying more. What ere we do or speak, how ere we live, All is acquitted if we will but Give; They sit in Bulwarks, and do make the lawes But fair pretences to a fowler cause, And horse-leech-like cry give, what ere they say, Or sing, the burden of their song is Pay. How wretched is that State! how full of wo, When those that should preserve, do overthrow! When they rule us, and ore them mony raignes, Who still cry Give, and alwayes gape for gains! But on those Judges lyes a heavy curse, That measure crimes by the delinquents purse. The time will come when they do cease to live, Some will cry Take, as fast as they cry'd Give. XLIII. On a pair of Virginals. Death, that ties up the tongues of Man and Beast, And to each thing gives a Quietus est, Gives me a tongue; and I that could not be Blest with a voice, now boast variety. The tale of Amphion which could make each tree Dance to his musick, is fulfiilli'd in me. For lo the liveless Jacks lavaltoes take At that sweet musick which themselves do make. The various-sounding strings in consort come, To make my narrow-bulke Elizium; Just Emblem of the State; for in this wise, He just now falls, that but just now did rise. O would the Subjects in this Realme agree, And meet like strings to make one harmony. XLVI. On a Comedie called The passionate lovers. Though I nere saw those Playes, nor ere did know The Author well, nor love with passion so, To be a name for Terence Comædie, But do suppose who ere the lover be, That's really such as the Poet writ, Would have less love, if he had had more wit. Yet as th' old Topers, when their drinking's gone, Do love to sit, and see the work go on. And as old men when their performance fails, Can clap their wings with telling smutt'd tales: So though we've lost the life of playes the stage, If we can be Remembrancers to the age. And now and then let glow a spark in print To tell the World ther's fire still lodg'd ith flint, We may agen b'enlightned once and warm'd, Men can't be civil till they be inform'd. Walk wisely on: Time's changeable, and what VVas once thrown down, is now again reacht at. And we may see pleasure and honour crown The Stage, when inconsistent Tubs kick'd down. XLV. To the high-Sheriff of S. Sir, You have giv'n us Poets entertainment, Good chear and wine; we give you Poets payment, Good words and rythme; but you out-do us here, You match our Rythme; but we can't match your chear. And here's the reason, which our Muses grieves, Sheriffs are made Poets, but nere Poets Sheriffs. XLVI. To G. B. Esq I promis'd to come to you Sir, 'tis true, And I intended what I promis'd you. But Heaven (that all things orders) thought not fit, We tvvo should meet, and therefore hinder'd it. Not that our meeting had offensive been To God or Man, for we had sai'ld between The dangerous rocks of company, which wits And no wits dash against, when in their fits, They scoffe at sacred matters and blaspheme, Or make Statesmen or businesses their theame. But such a World of Heavenly drink came down, The floods did rise and all the Country drown; Them that had souls unpoisable like mine Float as drown'd flies do in a glass of wine. Horses and boots were useless, and you know, I have no hanging look; and being so Flat, have the art of sinking, I was ne're Bred 'mong the fish, nor were at Westminster, Saw any drown'd, though you and I both know, Some have been us'd as badly there, and though I uses the feather 'tis the tother end, Not that which me from drowning can defend This vvork's for Saylours, not a land Attourney, For tis become a voyage, not a journey. And he that goes to Ex'ter novv from hence, From that exploit may very vvell commence A navigator, vvhich t attempt I fear, And thought it safer to stay drinking here, And send you this from him that far more vvilling To vvrite ten verses then to pay five shillings. XLVII. To his reverend Friend Dr. S. on his pious and learned book. The times are chang'd, and the misguided rout Now tug to pull in what they tumbled out, And with like eagerness. The factious crue, Who ruin'd all, are now expos'd to view: Their vizor's off, and now we plainly see Both what they are, and what they aim'd to be And what they meant to do to us and ours, If either ours or we were in their pow'rs. That vip'rous brood of Levi who gnaw'd through Their mothers bowels, and their Fathers too, To break a passage to their lewd designes Have found th' effects of all their under mines, And see themselves out-acted in their show, By sucking Sprouts that out of them did grow They're now out-wink'd, out-fasted &amp; out-tung'd Their Pulpits reap those fields, which they had dung'd Who split the Church into so many Schismes, The zeals of these eats tothers Patriarchismes. And Vermin-like they—do that corps devour, VVhose putrefaction gave them life and pow'r. Now they repent (though late) and turn to you, Of the Old Church that's constant, pure and true. Thanks to such lights as you are, who have stay'd In that firm truth, from which they fondly stray'd, Endur'd reproach, and want, all violent shocks Which rowl'd like Billovvs, vvhile you stood like Rocks, Unmov'd by all their fury, kept your ground Fix'd as the poles, vvhiles they kept tvvirllng round. Submitted to all rage, and lost your all, Yet ne're comply'd vvith, or bow'd knee to Baal. You preach'd for love of preaching, vvith desire T instruct, and to reform, while pay and hire, Which made them preach, vvere ta'ne avvay from you, You still strove on, and led the people through. That Wilderness of errour, into vvhich Those Ignes fatui, tempted by the itch Of Pride and change had led them, and vvhen th' Times Envying your vvorth, voted your sermons crimes, And made it treason to relieve or hear you, And constituted to affront and jeer you, Those Patentees of graces and good livings Grovvn rich vvith fees, and fat vvith full thanksgivings, Who rovvl'd a stone upon your mouths for fear Truth would find out a resurrection there: Then from the press you piously did shevv What, vvhy, &amp; hovv, vve should believe and knovv; And pray and practice; made it out to us Why our Church-Institutes vvere these and thus; And hovv vve ought t'observe them, so that vve May find them that, vvhich of themselves they be; Commands and comforts: This Sir vve do find Perform'd by this rare issue of your mind. Your pious and your profitable lines, Which can't be prays'd by such a pen as mine's, But must b' admir'd and lov'd, and you must be For ever thank'd and honour'd too by me, And all that knovv or read you; since you do Supply the pious and the learned too. So vvell, that both must say, to you they ow What good they practice, and what good they know. XLVIII. To Colonel Lovelace on his Poems. So through the Chaos crept the first born ray That was not yet grown up to be a day, And form'd the World; as do your powerful rythme Through the thick darkness of these verseless times These antingenious dayes, this boystrous age, Where there dwells nought of Poetry but rage: Just so crept learning forth the rav'nous fire Of the Schismatick Goths, and Vandals ire: As do in these more barbarous dayes our times, VVhen what was meant for ruine, but refines. Why mayn't we hope for Restauration, when As ancient Poets Townes, the new rais'd men, The tale of Orpheus and Amphion be Both solid truths with this Mythology? For though you make not stones &amp; trees to move, Yet men more senceless you provoke to love. I can't but think, spite of the filth that's hurl'd Over this small Ench'ridion of the World, A day will break, when we again may see Wits like themselves, club in an harmony. Though Pulpiteers can't do it, yet 'tis fit Poets have more success, because more wit. Their Prose unhing'd the State; why may'nt your verse Polish those souls, that were fil'd rough by theirs? Go on, and prosper; though I want your skill, In weighty matters tis enough to will. And novv the Reader looks I should help near Your glories Trophy, else what make I here? Tis not to praise you; for one may as well Go tell Committees that there is an hell, Or tell the World there is a Sun, as praise Your amorous fancy, which it self can't raise Bove Envies reach or flatteries; Ladies love To kiss those accents; who dares disapprove What they stile good? our lines, our lives, and all; Therefore the cause why these are fixed here, Is livery-like to shew some great man's near; Let them stand bare, and usher, not commend; They are not for Encomiums, but t' attend. XLIX. On the famous Romance, called The innocent Impostor. Twill be expected now that I should raise Some Monument unto the Authors prayse, The Works, or the Translators; else I fear, The Reader 'll wonder, what I do make here. Tis grown Apocryphal, and by the Wits Quite voted down; VVho hold it not befits A true-born Fancy, to be Smithfield-wise Put off with Toll and Vouchers; this defies Such Crutches; for tis of so clear a Nature Twill pass without the Chaplins Imprimatur, Or our Certificates. Besides I carry Such a dislike to all things Customary, I'll cheat all expectation, and will be Thankfull to them, but chiefly unto thee. In these Self-ended times we only do Or thank or praise those we're beholding to; So call our Justice Charity, and say VVe do bestow, when we do only pay. For though the work be rare; yet should it be Still in its dress, what had it been to me? And though translated by this worthy pen, If not exposed to the view of Men, I had ne're seen't perhaps. But since all three Have clubb'd in this production, I must be Gratefull to all, and to give all your right, Must prayse, and love and thank Bellay, Dod, Wright L. On Dr. J. his divine Romant. How rare! how truly noble's this designe To make us fall in love with things divine! And raise our passions with such pious flames, To court those truths, which lay disguis'd in names Perplex'd and crabbed, and did heretofore Lie undiscoverd in their sullen Ore; And seemed unamiable to the sense, 'Cause unattainable but by th' expence Of undelight some labour and much time. This new invention expiates the crime, Which did too much adheare to youthful love; Directs the soul to doat on things above, And consecrates th' affections to extend Their violent motion to their proper end. The ravish'd Pulpit which of late was made A place, not of instruction but of trade, Where Higlers in Divinity did sell Salvation to us, and made heaven and hell At their disposal, and the way to bliss More hard and crabbed then it ought or is; And did advance the people or condemn To this or that, just as we humor'd them: Made some those heavenly dishes to detest And loath, 'cause they so nastily were drest. But this ingenuous Authour makes that food Delightsome to the taste as well as good; And with such flowers the paths to virtue strews, That the dull soul to heav'n delighted goes. VVhat love, what praise, what great reward is fit To his great worth, who with Cælestial wit Informes and sanctifies our minds, and brings Our souls above these low terrestriall things! A crown of Stars must deck his learned brow, The lawrel garlands's too unworthy now. LI. On the loss of a Garrison meditation. Another City lost! Alas poor King! Still future griefs from former griefs do spring. The World's a seat of change; Kingdoms &amp; Kings Though glorious, are but sublunary things. Crosses and blessings kiss; ther's none that be So happy, but they meet with misery. He that ere while sate centred to his Throne, And all did homage unto him alone; Who did the Scepter of his power display From pole to pole, while all this rule obey, From stair to stair now tumbles, tumbles down, And scarce one pillar doth support his Crown. Town after Town, Field after Field, This turnes, and that perfidiously doth yield: He's banded on the trayterous thought of those That Janus like, look to him and his foes. In vain are Bulwarks, and the strongest hold, If the beseigers bullets are of gold. My soul be not dejected; would'st thou be From present trouble, or from danger free? Trust not in rampires, nor the strength of walls, The town that stands to day, to morrow falls. Trust not in Souldiers, though they seem so stout; Where sin's within, vain is defence without. Trust not in wealth, for in this lawless time Where prey is penalty, there wealth is crime. Trust not in strength or courage; we all see The weak'st oftimes do gain the victory. Trust not in honour, honours but a blast Quickly begun, and but a while doth last. They that to day to thee Hosanna cry, To morrow change their note for Crucifie. Trust not in friends, for friends will soon deceive thee, They are in nothing sure, but sure to leave thee. Trust not in wit; who run from place to place Changing Religion as chance does her face In spite of cunning, and their strength of brain, They're often catch, and all their plots are vain. Trust not in Councel; Potentates, or Kings All are but frail and transitory things. Since neither Souldiers, Castles, wealth, or wit Can keep off harm from thee, or thee from it: Since neither strength nor honour, friends nor Lords, Nor Princes, peace or happiness affords, Trust thou in God, ply him with prayers still, Be sure of help; for he both can, and will. LII. Upon the Kings imprisonment. Imprison me you Traytors? must I be Your fetter'd slave, while you're at liberty T'usurp my Scepter, and to make my power Gnaw its own bowels, and it self devour? You glorious villains! Treasons that have been Done in all ages, are done ore agen; Expert proficients, that have far out-done Your Tutors Presidents, and have out-run The practice of all times, whose acts will be Thought Legendary by Posterity. VVas't not enough you made me bear the wrong Of a rebellious sword, and viprous tongue, To lose my State, my Children, Crown and Wife; But must you take my liberty and life? Subjects can find no fortress but their graves, VVhen servants sway, and Soveraigns are slaves. Cause I'l not sign, nor give consent unto Those lawless actions that you've done and do, Nor yet betray my Subjects, and so be As treacherous to them, as you to me; Is this the way to mould me to your wills, To expiate former crimes, by greater ills? Mistaken fools to think my soul can be Grasp'd or infring'd, by such low things as ye! Alas though I'm immur'd, my mind is free, I'l make your very gaol my liberty. Plot, do your worst, I safely shall deride In my Crown'd soul, your base inferiour pride, And stand unmov'd, though all your plagues you bring, I'll dye a Martyr, or I'll live a King. LIII. On the death of King Charles. How! dead! nay murdred! not a Comet seen! Nor one strange prodigy to intervene! I'm satisfy'd; heav'n had no sight so rare, Nor so prodigious as his murtherers are, Who at this instant had not drawn the air, Had they not been preserv'd b'his funeral pray'r. And yet who looks aright, may plainly spy The Kingdom's to it self a prodigy; The scattered stars have joyned themselves in one, And have thrown Phoebus headlong from his throne. They'ld be the sun themselves, and shine, and so By their joynt blaze inflame the world below, Which b' imitation does t'a Chaos fall, And shake it self t' an Earthquake general. And 'tis the height of miracle that we Live in these wonders, yet no wonders see. Thus those that do enjoy a constant day, Do scarce take notice of that wondrous ray. Nature groand out her last when he did fall Whose influence gave quicking to us all. His soul was anthem'd out in prayers, and those Angelike Halelujahs sung in prose David the second; we no difference knew Between th'old Davids spirit and the new. In him grave wisdom so with grace combines; As Solomon were still in Davids loynes. And had we lived in K. Davids time, He had equall'd him in all things but his crime. Now since you'r gone, great P. this care we'l have Your books shall never find a death or grave; By whose diviner flame, the world must be Purged from its dross, and chang'd to purity, Which neither time nor treason can destroy, Nor ign'rant Error that's more fell then they. A peice like some rare picture, at remove, Shew's one side Eagle, and the other Dove. Sometimes the Reason in it soars so high, It shews affliction quells not majesty, Yet still Crown, dignity and self deny'd, It helps to bear up courage though not pride; Trodden humility in robes of state, Meekly despising all the frownes of fate. Your Grandsire K. that shew'd what good did flow From the the tall Cedar to the shrub below. By violent flame to ashes though calcin'd, His soul in't you we transmigrated find; Whose leafs shall like the Cybels be ador'd, When time shall open each prophetick word: And shall like scripture be the rule of good To those that shall survive the flaming flood: Whose syllables are Libraries, and can Make a smal volume turn a Vatican. So th' hunted Bezar when he's sure to dye, Bequeaths his cordials to his enemy. Rest Royal dust, and thank the stormes that drove Against its will you to your haven above. They have but freed you from those waves that curld Their bloody pow'r to drown this boistrous world They've but chang'd Throne for throne, and crown for crown; You took a glorious, laid a thorny down You sit among your Peers with Saints and Kings, View how we shoot for sublunary things, And labour for our ruine; you did fall Just like our Saviour, for the sins of all; And for your own; for in this impious time Virtue's a vice, and piety's a crime. The sume of all whose faults being understood, Is this, We were too bad, and you to good. LIIII. On the Kings death. What means this sadness? why does every eye VVallow in tears? what makes the lowring sky Look clouded thus with sighs? is it because The great Defender of the faith and lawes Is sacrifized to the barbarous rage, Of those prodigious Monsters of our age? A prey to the insatiate will of those That are the Kings and Kingdomes cursed foes! Tis true ther's cause enough each eye should be A Torrent, and each man a Niobe. To see a wise, just, valiant, temperate man Should leave the VVorld, who either will or can Abstain from grief? To see a Father dye, And his half-self, and Orphans weeping by: To see a Master dye, and leave a State Unsetled, and Usurpers gape to ha't. To see a King dissolve to's mother dust, And leave his headless Kingdome to the lust And the ambitious wills of such a rout, Which work its end, to bring their own about, Tis cause of sorrow, but to see these slain, Nay murdred too, makes us grieve ore again. But to be kill'd by Servants, or by Friends, This will raise such a grief as never ends. And yet we find he that was all these things, And more, the best of Christians and of Kings, Suffer'd all this and more, whose sufferings stood So much more great then these, as he more good. Yet tis a vain thing to lament our loss; Continued mourning adds but cross to cross. VVhat's pass'd can't be recall'd; our sadness may Drive us to him, but can't bring him away; Nor can a Kingdomes cries re-state the crown Upon his head, vvhich their sins tumbled dovvn. Rest then my soul, and be contented in Thy share of sufferings, as vvell as sin. I see no cause of vvonder in all this, But still expect such fruits of vvickedness. Kings are but Earth refin'd; and he that wears A crown, but loads himself, with griefs and fears. The World it self to its first nothing tends; And things that had beginings, must have ends. Those glorious lamps of Heav'n, that gives us light, Must at the last dissolve to darkness quite. If the Cælestial Architectures go To dissolution, so must earthy too. If ruine seize on the vast frame of nature, The little VVorld must imitate the greater. I'l put no trust in vvealth, for I do see Fate can take me from it, or it from me. Trust not in honour, tis but peoples cry, Who'll soon throw down what ere they mounted high. Nor trust in friends; he that's now hedg'd about, In time of need can hardly find one out. Nor all in strength or power; for sin will be The desolation of my strength and me. Nor yet in crownes and Kingdomes; who has all, Is expos'd to a heavy though a royal fall. Nor yet in wisdom, pollicy, or wit; It cannot keep me harmeless, or I it. He that had all man could attain unto, He that did all that wit or power could do, Or grace or vertue prompt, could not avoid That sad and heavy load our sins have laid Upon his innocent and sacred Head, but must Submit his person to bold Rebells lust, And their insatiate rage, vvho did condemn And kill him, vvhile he pray'd and dy'd for them. Our only trust is in the King of Kings, To vvait vvith patience the event of things; He that permits the Fathers tumbling dovvn, Can raise, and will, the Son up to the crown. He that permits those traytors impious hands To murther his anoynted, and his Lands To be usurp'd, can when he sees it fit, Destroy those Monsters which he did permit; And by their headlong and unpitied fall, Make the Realms Nuptial of their funerall. Mean time that sainted Martyr from his throne, See's how these laugh, and his good subjects groan; And hugs his blessed change, whereby he is Rob'd into a crown, and murther'd into a bliss. LV. A funeral Elegy on Mr. Aubrey. Gon are those Halcyon dayes, when men did dare Do good, for love undrawn by gain or fear; Gon are our Heroes whose vast souls did hate Vice, though't were cloath'd in sanctity or state; Gon is our Awbrey who did then take's time To dye, when worthy men thought life a crime. One whose pure soul with nobleness was fill'd, And scorn'd to live when peace &amp; truth were kill'd One, who was worthy by descent and birth, Yet would not live a burthen on the earth, Nor draw his honour from his grandsires name, Unless his progeny might do the same. No guilded Mammon, yet had enough to spend, To feed the poor, and entertain his friend. No gaping Miser whose desire was more T'enrich himself, by making's neighbour poor, Then to lay out himself, his wealth and health, To buy his Countries good and Common-wealth. Religion was his great delight and joy, Not as 'tis now to plunder and destroy; His lean'd on those two pillars faith and reason, Not false Hypocrisy, nor headlong treason. His piety was with him bred and grovvn; He'ld build ten Churches, e're he'ld pull down one. Constant to's principles; and though the times Made his worth sin, and his pure vertues crimes, He stood unmov'd spite of all troubles hurl'd, And durst support but not turn with the World. Call'd to the Magistracy, he appear'd One that desir'd more to be lov'd then fear'd; Justice and Mercy on him mingled so, That this flew not too high, not that too low: His mind could not be carved worse or better, By mean mens flattery, nor by great men letter: Nor sway'd by Bribes, though profer'd in the dark, He scorn'd to be half Justice and half Clerk; But all his distributions ev'nly ran, Both to the Pesant and the Gentleman. He did what nature had design'd him to In his due time, while he had strength to do. And when decay and age did once draw nigh, He'd nothing left to do but only dye. And when he felt his strength and youth decline, His bodies losse strengthen'd his souls design: And as the one did by degrees decay, T other ran swifter up the milky way. Freed from those sicknesses that are the page; Attending Natures sad decay and ages, His spotless soul did from his body fly, And hover in the heav'nly Galaxy, Whence he looks dovvn, &amp; lets the living see, What he was once, and vvhat vve ought to be. LVI. Upon the death of that Reverend and learned Divine, Mr. Josias Shute. Tush, tush! he is not dead; I lately spide One smile at's first born Sons birth; and a bride Into her heart did entertain delight At the approach of her wish'd wedding night. All which delights (if he were dead) would turn To griefe; yea mirth it self be forc'd to mourn Inspired Poets would forget to laugh, And write at once his and Mirths Epitaph. Sighs would engross our breath, there would appear Anthems of joy, lymbeck'd into a tear: Each face would be his death-bed; in each eye 'Twere easie then to read his Elegy; Each soul would be close mourner, each tongue tell Stories prick'd out to'th tune o'th passing bell; The VVorld redrown'd in tears; each heart would be A marble stone, each stone a Niobe. But he alass is gone, nor do we know To pay for loss of him deserving wo; Like Bankrupts in our grief, because we may Not halfe we ovve him, give, we'l nothing pay. For should our tears like the Ocean issue forth, They could not svvell adæquate to his vvorth: So far his vvorth's above our knovvledge that VVe only knovv vve've lost, vve knovv not vvhat The mourning Heaven, beholding such a dearth Of tears, showrs rain to liquify the earth, That we may see from its adulterate womb, If it be possible, a second come. Till then tis our unhappiness, we can't Know what good dwelt in him, but by the want. He was no whirlegig Lect'rer of the times, That from a heel block to a pulpit climes, And there such stuff among their Audients break, They seem to have mouth, and words, yet cannot speak. Nor such as into pasquill pulpits come With thundering non sence, but to beat the drum To civil wars, whose texts and doctrines run As if they were o'th separation; And by their spiritual law have marri'd been VVithout a ring, because they were no kin. Knowledg and zeal in him so swettly met, His pulpit seem'd a second Olivet, VVhere from his lips he would deliver things As though some Seraphin had clap'd his wings. His painfull sermons were so neatly dress'd, As if an Anthem were in prose express'd; Divinity and Art were so united, As if in him both were Hermaphrodited. Oh what an excellent Surgeon has he been To set a conscience (out of joynt by sin) He at one blow could wound and heal; we all VVondred to see a purge a cordial. His Manna-breathing sermons often have Given all our good thoughts life, our bad a grave. Satan, and Sin, were never more put to't Then when they met with their still-conquering Shute. His life was the use of's doctrine; so twas known That Shute, and Saint, were convertible grown: He did live Sermons; the prophane were vext To see his actions comments on his text. So imitable his vertues did appear As if each place to him a pulpit were. He was himself a Synod, our's had been Void (had he liv'd) or but an idle dinn. His presence so divine, that Heaven might be (If it were possible) more Heavenly. And now we well perceive with what intent Death made his soul become non-resident. Twas to make him (such honours to him given) Regis Professor to the King of Heaven. By whom hee's prelated above the skies, And the whole VVorlds his See t'Episcopize; So that (me thinks) one star more doth appear In our Horizon since his being there; Death's grown tyrannical by imitation Cause he was learned by a sequestration He took his living; but for's benefice Heeis rewarded with eternal bliss. Let's all prepare to follow him, for hee's But gone to Glorys school, to take degrees. LVII. To the memory of Doctor Hearn, who dyed September 15. 1644. Sad Spectacle of grief! how frail is Man! VVhose self's a buble, and his life a span! VVhose breath's like a careering shade, whose sun Begins to set, when it begins to run. Lo this Mans sun sets i'th Meridian, And this mans sun, speaks him the sun of Man. Among the rest that come to sacrifice To's memory the torrents of their eyes, I though a stranger, and though none of those That weep in rythme, though I oft mourn in prose, Sigh out some grief, and my big-belly'd eyes Long for delivery at his obsequies. For he that writes but truth of him, will be, Though without art, slander'd with poesie. And they that praise him right in prose or verse, Will by the most be thought Idolaters. Men are s'incredulous; and yet ther's none Can write his worth in verse, but in his own. He needs no other monument of fame, But his own actions, to blaze out his name. He was a glory to the Doctors gown, Help to his Friends, his Country and his Town. The Atlas of our health, who oft did groan For others sickness, ere he felt his own. Hippocrates, and Galen, in his brain Met as in Gemini; it did contain. A library of skill, a panoply, A Magazine of ingenuity. With every Art his brain so well was mated, As if his fancy had been calculated For that Meridian; he none would follow But was in skill the Brittanish Apollo. His Patients grow impatient, and the fear Of death, lymbeck'd their bodies into tears. The widdow'd Muses do lament his death; Those that wrote mirth, do now retract their breath, And breath their souls in sighs; each strives to be No more Thalia, but Melpomene. He stood a Champion in defence of health, And was a terror to deaths Common-wealth. His Esculapius art revok'd their breath, And often gave a non-suit unto death. Now vve've a rout, death kill'd our General, Our griefs break forth, grow Epidemical. Now we must lay down arms, and Captives turn To death; man has no rampire but an urne, In him death gets an University; Happy the bodies that so nere him lye, To hear his worth and wit, tis now no fear To dye, because we meet a Hearne there. Earth-quakes, &amp; Commets usher great mens fall, At his we have an Earth-quake General; Th' ambitious vallies do begin t' aspire, And would confront the Mountains, nay be higher; Inferior orbes aspire, and do disdain Our Sol; each Bear would ride in Charles his wain. Our Moons eclips'd, and th' Occidental Sun Fights with old Aries for his Horizon. Each petty slave gets horses, and would be All Sols, and joyn to make a prodigy. All things are out of course, which could not be, But that we should some special death foresee. Yet let's not think him dead who nere shall dye, Till time be gulf'd in vast eternity. Tis but his shadow that is past away; While he's eclips'd in earth, another day His better part shall peirce the skies, and shine In glory 'bove the Heavens Chrystaline. He is but freed from troubles that are hurl'd Upon this smal Enchiridion of the World. We could not understand him, hee's gone higher To read a Lecture to an Angels Quire. He is advanc'd up a higher story, To take's degrees 'ith upper form of glory. He is our Prodrome, gone before us whether VVe all must go, though all go not together: Dust will dissolve to dust, to earth; earth we're all men; And must all dye, none knows how, where, nor when. LVIII. An Elegy on the death of his Schoolmaster. Mr. W. H. Must he dye thus? has an eternal sleep Seiz'd on each muse that it can't sing nor weep? Had he no friends? no merits? or no purse To purchase mourning? or had he that curse Which has the scraping wordling still frequented, To live unlov'd and perish unlamented? No; none of these; but in this Atlas fall Learning for present found its funeral. Nor was't for want of grief, but scope and vent; Not sullennesse, but deep astonishment; Small griefs are soon wept out; but great ones come With bulk, and strike the straight lamenters dumb. This was the schoolmaster that did derive From parts and piety's prerogative, The glory of that good, but painful art; Who had high learning yet an humble heart. The Drake of Grammer learning, whose great pain Circled that globe, and made that voyage plain. Time was, when th'artless pædagogue did stand With his vimineous scepter in his hand, Raging like Bajazet or'e the tugging fry, Who though unhors'd were not of th' infantry; Applying, like a glister, hic hæc hoc, Till the poor Lad's beat to a whipping block; And schoold so long to know a Verb and Nown, Till each had Propria maribus of his own: As if not fit to learn As in præsenti, But legally, when they were one and twenty. Those few that went to th' Universt'ys then, Went with deliberation, and were men. Nor were our Academies in those dayes Fill'd with chuck-farthing Batchelours and boyes, But schollers with more beard and age went hence, Then our new lapwing-Lectres skip from thence. By his industrous labour now we see Boyes coated borne to th' Universitie, Who suck'd in Latine, and did scorn to seek Their scourge and top in English but in Greek. Hebrew the general puzler of old heads, Which the gray dunce with pricks &amp; comments reads, And dubs himself a schoollar by it, grew As natural t'him as if he'd been a Jew. But above all he timely did inspire His Scholars breasts with an ætherial fire. And sanctify'd their early learning so, That they in grace, as they in wit did grow: Yet nor his grace nor learning could defend him From that mortality that did attend him; Nor can there now be any difference known, Between his learned bones and those with none. For that grand Lev'ler death hudles t'one place Rich, poor, wise, foolish, noble and the base. This only is our comfort and defence, He was not immaturely ravish'd hence. But to our benefit, and to his own, Undying fame and honour, let alone Till he had finish'd what he was to do, Then naturally split himself in two. And that's one cause he had so few moyst eyes, He made men learned, and that made them wise, And overrule their passions, since they see Tears would but shew their own infirmitie. And 'tis but loving madness to deplore The fate of him that shall be seen no more. But only I cropt in my tender years, Without a tongue, or wit, but sighs and tears; And yet I come to offer what is mine, An immolation to his honour'd shrine; And retribute what he confer'd on me, Either to's person or his memory. Rest pious soul and let that happy grave That is intrusted vvith thy Relicks have This just in scription, that it holds the dust Of one that was Wise, Learned, Pious, Just. LIX. An Epitaph. If beauty, birth, or friends, or vertue cou'd Preserve from putrefaction flesh and blood, This Lady had still liv'd; who had all those, And all that Nature, Art or Grace bestowes. But death regards not bad or good; All that's mortal is his food. Only here, our comfort lyes, Though death does all sorts confound, Her better part surmounts the skies, While her body sleeps ith' ground. Her soul returnes to God, from whom it came, And her great virtues do embalme her name. LX. An Epitaph on Mrs. G. Who ever knows or hears whose sacred bones Rest here within these monumental stones, How dear a mother and how sweet a wife, If he has bowels, cannot for his life But on her ashes must some tears distill, For if men will not weep, this marble will. EPIGRAMS. Translated. I. On Rome. Travellour, thou lookst for old Rome in the new, And yet in Rome, thou nought of Rome canst view. Behold the frame of walls, dis-joynted stone, And the vast Theater, that's overthrown; Lo here's Romes carkass still; thou may'st behold How the new Rome is threatned by the old. Learn hence the power of fate, fix'd things decay, But that that's alwayes toss'd &amp; mov'd, does stay. II. On a quareller. A humerous fellow in a Tavern late, Being drunk and valiant, gets a broken pate; The Surgeon with his instruments, and skill, Searches his scull deeper, and deeper still, To feel his brains, and tries if those were sound, And as he keeps ado about the wound, The fellow cryes, Good Surgeon spare the pains; When I began this brawle, I had no brains. III. On a lover. What various griefs within my breast do grow? I burn, yet from my flames my tears doflow. I'm Nile, and Etna both together grown, For the same grief does both enflame and drown. O let my tears, make my strong flames expire, Or let my tears be drunk up by my fire. IV. On Gold. In vain was Danae clos'd in brazen Tower, No brazen fort keeps out a golden showre. V. To a Friend. Thou sent'st me wine, I'd too much wine before; Send thirst if thou would'st send to please me more. VI. On Alexander. Great Alexander thought the World too smal, Which he with's warlike hand subdu'd and beat. But did not he himself most little call? He in a little World could not be great. VII. On a Bankrupt. A Bankrupt heard a Theif enter by stealth His house by night, and search about for's wealth. In vain (quoth he) thou lookst for goods by night, For I my self can see none when tis light. VIII. On a Priest and a Theif. A Priest did with a theif together come, To'th' place, where he was to receive his doom. Said; Be not sad, do but believe, and thou Shall't be a guest, to feast with Angels now. He sigh'd, and said; if you'll true comfort shew, Go then and take my place, I'l stay below. No, quoth the Priest, this day I keep a fast, And cannot eat untill this day be past. IX. On Love and Death. Love once and death chang'd weapons, and death took Loves fiery dart, while Cupid got deaths hook, Love at the body, death at th' mind lets fly, This makes old men to love, and young men dye. X. On Women. Women are pleasant evills, and they have Two proper seasons, when in bed or grave. XI. On a Wolfe sentenc'd. The Country people once a wolfe did take, That of their sheep &amp; lambs did havock make; Some voted that he should be crucifi'd, Others would have him in the fire be fry'd; Some to be hew'd in peices with a sword, And to be thrown to dogs to be devour'd. Among the rest, one whom unlucky fate Had doom'd to th' troubles of a married State, (The common lot of men) oh? Friends (sayes he) Lay by your forkes, and ropes, that knotty be; The sword, the fire, the guns, the cross, the whips, Are but slight tortures, I have one out-strips All those, if you would punish him to the life, Fit for his crimes, then let him wed a wife. XII. On one more learned then others. Thou makest thy self more learned then thy betters, And brag'st thou knowst Greek Hebrew, Latin letters. Thou hast them in thy forehead, and thy hand, As if th' hadst all the tongues at thy command; For the excecutioner has made thee more Letter'd by far then thou wert ere before. XIII. On Galla. Blame not fair Galla that she'ld married be, (Though she be fair) to one that could not see. For in that thing in which she took delight, And which he lov'd, there is no need of sight. XIV. On one lowsie and poor. A lowsie fellow once was ask'd, how he Having so many cattel, poor could be? He answered hence proceeds my poverty, Though Il'd sell all for nought, yet none would buy. XV. A happy death. Learn to live well, if thou'ldst dye happily; And that thou may'st live happy, learn to dye. XVI. On Nero. VVhen bloody Nero his own mother slew, He did not hurt her face, or eyes, tis true; But ripd her bowels up; 'twas justly done, They'd guilt enough in breeding such a Son. XVII. On Love. Love is a Merchandize, and Venus drove The first Monopoly; Rich only Love. What cannot fortune hire alas for gold? When Gods themselves for this are bought and sold? XVIII. Rules of drinking. If the Philosophers sayes true, the first Draught'is refreshment unto them that thirst; The second-mirth and wit doth still afford; But perfect drunkeness issues from the third. If to these rigid rules you'l me confine, Hence glasses; I'l in flagons drink my wine. XIX. A vain Boaster. Thou need'st not boast, cause thou afore does go, If that be honour, my dog does so to. XX. To Momus. Thou call'st me begger, Momus, and dost tell I must not triumph so, nor so much swell, Because I have but little; and yet that Is not my own, but other Mens Estate. Why shouldst thou thus upbraid me with my want? Must I be blam'd because my fortunes scant? I'm honest still; thou liv'st by theft alone; Between us two the difference is none; For both of us on others bread do dine, Only thou stealst thy meat, I beg for mine. XXI. On Phillis tears. When Phillis comes t'her husbands grave, she brings No garlands, nor with Odoriferous things Sprinkles the ground: only her tears doth shed Upon the grave, wherein her joy was led. The flowers do straight spring up, as if she had power To ripen with her eyes, and moysten with her showre. XXII. On a proud fool. Thou call'st me ignorant; tis true; but how If I know more then Socrates did know! He knew one thing, that he did nothing know; I know two things, that I know nought, nor thou. XXIII. On time. Our joyfull years do pass too soon away, A minutes grief seems an eternal day. XXIV. On a blind, and lame begger. How happily fate hath together joyn'd, Two feeble men, one lame, and tother blind! The blind Man bears the lame, the lame supplies, By his direction, to'thers want of eyes. See what the iron power of need can do, It makes the blind to see, the lame to go. XXV. On a Spartan Lady. A Spartan Lady bravely slew her son, Because she saw him from the battail run; Thou canst not be (quoth she) a Spartan known, Unless thy valiant mind declare thee one. XXIV. On Philip of Macedon. Jove, shut the gates of heav'n, for Philip sayes, He'l enter it; since earth and sea obeys His powerfull scepter, there is left no room On earth for him, he must to heaven come. XXVII. The Answer. I will not though I may, shut heaven gates, Nor do I care for Philip, or his threats. If Earth and Sea his scepter do obey, The way to Heaven's too narrow, hell's his way. XXVIII. Frugality Use thy Estate, as if thould'st dye to day, Yet spare thy Estate as if thould'st live for ay. He's truly wise who where he spends or spare, Observes a mean, and do's extreams forbear. XXIX. On two wives. I blame him not, who having one wife had, Another seeks; the last was good or bad; If good, he hopes, there are of such good store; If bad, he hopes he shall have such no more. XXX. On a Murtherer. A flying Murtherer lay beneath a wall That was all ruinous, and like to fall. An Angel to him did in's sleep appear, Bad him be gone, and lodge some other where. No sooner gone, but down the wall straight fell, Then he thanks God, that he escap'd so well. The Angel said, Dost think I like thy deed, Because from this destruction I thee freed? Sins of this nature never scape my curse, Thou'rt saved from this death, to meet a worse. XXXI. On a Fisherman. A fisher, while he angled in a brook, A dead man's skull by chance hung in his hook; The pious man in pitty did it take, To bury it, a grave with's hand did make; And as he digg'd, found gold. Thus to good men, Good turnes with good turnes are repay'd agen XXXII. On a burnt ship. Unhappy ship, that must by flames expire, And having scap'd by waters, fall by fire! The Stepdame Sea hath safely landed Thee; Thy mother Earth's more treacherous then she. XXXIII. Aliter. I that ere while of waters was afraid, For lack of waters, am by fire destroy'd. You waves, whom late I curst, I now implore, Then I'd too much, and now I long for more. XXXIV. On a Covetous Man. Thou that art counted rich, I count thee poor; Use only showes our wealth; we have no more Then what we use; what we keep for our heirs, We cannot say tis our goods, for tis theirs. XXXV. On Hermocrates. Hermocrates made's will, when sickness came, And made himself Executioner of the same. Then he began to count, how much t'would cost To th' Doctor and himself, for the health he'd lost; But when he saw to how much it did come, He'ld rather dye then give so great a summe. So to keep's wealth, and to save charges, dyes; His heirs do mourn in sack, and braveries. XXXVI. On a poor and sick Man. VVhen age and sickness did upon me seize, Of age none could, of want none would me ease. With palsy'd limbs, I to my grave did go, And there did end my want and sickness too. The lawes of fate preposterously were plac'd, I found my grave at first, my death at last. XXXVII. On a Hare. A hare unsafe by land lep'd into the main, Flying land-dogs, was by a sea-dog slain. Poor worm! flyes she to Earth, to sea, to sky, Each hath a dog, and she by dogs must dye. XXXVIII. On Balaams Ass. The Prophet Baalam wondred heretofore An Ass could speak, and now ther's none speak more. XXXIX. Upon Democritus and Heraclitus. VVeep Heraclitus; it fits the age wherein Nothing but filth, nothing but sorro'ws seen. And laugh Democritus, laugh while thou list, Nothing but folly, nought but vain, thou seest. This alwayes weeps, that still remains in gladness, Yet both endure one labour, both one sadness. Now need requires (since all the World is mad) A thousand laughing, and a thousand sad. Tis time the World turn'd (madness is so sore) T' Anticera, the grass to Hellebore. XL. Out of Catullus. My Mistress saith she'll marry none but me, Though Jove himself should force her unto it But Womens words unto their lovers be So firm, they may in wind or waves be writ. XLI. On an Astronomer that tryed by rules of Art to find whether he were a Cuckold Star-gazing fool? thou from the signs wouldst see And Planets face what thy wives dealings be. She does her works below, where Sun nere pries, And though she's light, she mounts not to the skies, 'Cause she's kept down by men; if in the sphear Thou Venus see, thou thinkst thy wife is there. And if the Bull or Aries thou dost see, Thou thinkst they are reflections of thee. Fool keep at home: when thou abroad dost go, In imitation her legs do so to. And when thou gazest in the skies to know Her works, she does even what she please below XLII. On Geneva's armes. Geneva bears the Eagle and the Key; The Empires this, and that the Papacy. If th' Emperour's Eagle, and the Pope agen Resume his Key, where is thy Empire then? XLIII. To a sad Widow. While widdow'd wife, for thy drown'd husband thou Dost with perpetual tears thy cheeks bedew, Eterniz'd in three graves his happy shade, In water twice, and once in Earth is laid. XLIV. On a bribed Judge. Two parties had a difference, and the cause Did come to be decided by the lawes. The bribing Plaintiff did the Judge present With a new coach; T'other with same intent, Gives him two horses; each with like design, To make the Judge to his own side incline. The cause being try'd, the Plantiffs overthrown, O coach (quoth he) thou art the wrong way gone; The Judge replide, It cannot but be so; For where his horses draw, your coach must go. XLV. To a jealous Husband. In vain thou shutt'st thy doors by day, in vain Windowes by night, thy wifes lust to refrain, For if a Woman only chast will be In watch and ward, she has no chastity. XLVI. On proud Rome. Shut up ye Gods the gates of Heaven above, And do thou keep thy heavenly Castle Jove. Now sea and Land are subject unto Rome; Only to Heaven they've yet no path to come. XLVII. Against Mourning. Men justly prayse the Thracians who do mourn When children from their mothers womb are born; But dead, they think they every way are blest, Because the fates have laid them to their rest. For well they know, all men are born to ill, But being dead, they've peace and quiet still. XLIX. Translated. Julia once stroke me with a ball of snow; I thought snow was not fire, yet that was so. Then snow what's colder? yet 't had pow'r t'inflame My breast, when from my Julias hand it came? What place have lovers free from treacheries, VVhen fire within congealed water lies? Julia alone can make my flames expire, Yet not with ice, or snow, but equal fire. L. An Essay of the Contempt of Greatnesse, being a Dialogue of Lucian made English. Lucian, With a long beard and broad, with hair untrim'd, Coatlesse, and shoe-less, almost naked lim'd; A wandring life you lead, as beasts do doe No certain place, are you confin'd unto. On the bare ground, and in the open air You rest your bones; the mantle which you wear, Your only garment both for night and day, Though rough and course, had worn it self away; But by the dirt that does thereon abide, Its gaping cranies daily are supply'd, The earth and air both, you about you bear; As earth 'tis dirty, and as thin as air; Grave Sir, what may you be pray? Cynicus, Youngman, why Seems this so strange t'you? here you see live I Content with what I can with ease obtain, And vvithout injury or danger gain; What costs no grief, nor trouble, I can feed And cloath my self with all, I nothing need, But unconcern'd can pass by and deride All, but what serves to nourish, warme, and hide. Pray tell me, do you think, that vitiousness Lies in superfluouous luxury? L. Surely yes. C. And don't you judge frugality in men To be a vertue too? L. I do. C. VVhy, then VVhen you see me more thriftily to live Then other men, and them their minds to give To cost and dainties, can it justice be To wink at those, and only censure me? L. Alas Sir, 'tis not Thriftily you live, But nigardly and basely. God does give VVith liberal hand his gifts, and with the same VVe ought to take them, &amp; we're much too blame If we neglect them, for we shall make void Those blessings, which he sends to be enjoyed. You pine your self, make your enjoyment scant By wilful affeciation still to want, And live in poverty. C. Therefore I pray, Since we are gone so forward in the vvay; Let's well consider, vvhat by wanton's ment, Or penury, and what's sufficient. L. Please you, let it be so; C. Is that which can Supply the just necessity of man, Esteem'd sufficient? or d'you judge or know A thing to be desired beyond that? L. No. C. May it be then call'd indigence or want, Or poverty when men sufficient han't? L. It may no doubt. C. Then I've sufficient, for I am without No thing that should supply necessity. More I nor crave nor want. L. How can that be? C. You'll quickly knovv, if you do vvell perpend And observe rightly, what's the proper end Those things were made for, which you say we need. Is not a house a shelter? L. Yes indeed. C. And are not garments coverings? L. True, they be. C. Both these defend and cover us, that we, VVhom these do shelter and do cover so, By their defence and warmth should better grow. L. No question. C. Do my feet now seem to you The worse, because not cover'd from your view? L. I know not truly. C. If you do not know, Learn what's the office of the feet. L. To go. C. And do my feet go worse then others do. L. Perhaps they don't. C. Nay they do not, I know; And since their office they performe me as well Naked as clad, why should the clad excel? And for my body, why's not that as good As other mens? if it were not, it wou'd Be more diseas'd, infirm and weak then theirs. But no infirmity in mine appears; And therefore since that health &amp; strength do show A bodies excellence, why's not mine so? Does this appear diseased? L. Not to me. C. Therefore my feet or body cannot be In want of other covering; for ne're doubt it, If they did want, they'ld be the worse without it; For want's a real evil to mankind; What e're we need, we languish till we find. I thrive in body, and look fresh you see, And sound and strong; my meat does nourish me. That fare that's counted course and vile by you, Makes me both strong and healthful. L. Very true. C. Else how could aged I who've liv'd so long, Remain so nimble, active and so strong? Did I on dainties feed, and gayly go, To pamper appetite as others do, Dwingle and pine I should, like them whose food Though twice more costly, is not half so good. L. Perhaps you might. C. VVhat reason then is there, VVhy you should pass a censure so severe Upon my vvay of living and esteem it VVretched and miserable? L. I so deem it, Because great nature (whom you all adore) And the great Gods this spatious vvorld did store, VVith such variety of gifts, and those so good, So excellent both for our ease and food, In such abundance too, that they supply Our coy delight as wel's necessity, And made all common as the world is, that All might of all alike participate: These blessings then we may, nay ought t'enjoy, And not to be so overnice and coy To slight them all, or all but very few, As they're neglected by the beasts and you. Water you drink as beasts do, and you eate What you next find, as dogs do drink and meat; And lodging's all alike; to rest or feast, You have no better pattern then the beast. The grounds your common bed, &amp; for your cloaths They'r such as every beggar justly loaths. You do content your self with things thus vile, Thus poor, and thus contemptible; the while Our bounteous God spreads his unwearied hand, And with variety gluts sea and land; Puts his fat cattle on our flowry plains, And fructifies the teeming earth with rains; Who makes returns in fruits such various store, Nature her self doth seem embroyderd o're. The tugging Bee brings her melliflous juice, Extracted from all flowers for mans use; Oyle like a deluge overwhelms the ground, And Amber floating on the sea is found; Peoples the seas with fishes, and our field, Groan as or'e burdend with the corn they yield; With various rare productions of such things As our delight, and with't our wonder brings. But above all the amorous fruitful Vine Hugs the tall trees, and the heart-cheering Wine, Blushes and swells in the plump grapes which be Drunk with their own rare juyce; &amp; why should we B'endow'd with these abilities which we find Do fill the body, and adorn the mind? Why have we strength, and art, and wit, to frame Such stately fabricks, but t'enjoy the same? And why does Art such various things produce, But for our ornament, delight and use? If you do well in slighting these things thus, God did not well in sending them to us. Should you by any other be debar'd Th'enjoyment of these things, how ill and hard VVould it appear t'you? it would vex your mind, As much as if you're fetterd and confind. VVhy then does your own self your self restrain, And limit from them thus? C. I should disdain Indeed to be confin'd by other men, And kept from these enjoyments so; but then Hear me a little, let me ask you this; Suppose a man that rich and bounteous is, Should make a sumptuous feast, and should invite Guests of all sorts, and please their appetite VVith cheer of all sorts too; for strongmen strong Dishes; and for the weaker palats mix among Some milder delicates, and fill his feast To the degree and palate of each guest; If 'mong the guests there should be one that wou'd Snatch and devoure all that on th'table stood, Reaching fromend to end; though lusty and strong, Yet eats those meats that to the weak belong; Out-sits all others and out feeds' um too, VVould you think this man temperate? I. Surely no. Nor temperate, nor good. C. But then suppose Another person should neglect all those Delicious junkets, and that costly fare, And those inticing delicates that are Superfluously invented to invite To new attempts the sated appetite, And placeth in one plain and wholesome dish, All that he needs, and all that others wish, And feeds but sparingly thereon, don't you Think this a temperate man? L. Indeed I do And on just reason. C. Do you apprehend By what I say, what tis I do intend? Or shall I tell you? L. Pray explain your mind C. God's this feast-Master, who of every kind VVith store of various blessings has supply'd Our various wants, and vast desires; beside For healthy men and strong he doth provide, Such diet as their health and strength can bide; The sick and weak he doth with food supply Apt for their sicknesse and infirmity: Not that we all should upon all things feed; But all have all things that they truly need: Yet so enrag'd our vast desires still be, And so insatiate is our mind, that we Reach at and gripe what e're we meet withall; And alwaies think what er'e we have too small T' appease our appetite that still aspires, And new enjoyments breed but new desires. The land and seas both contribute their store To our fond wills, yet still we long for more. VVhat nature scatters with her lib'ral hand O're the wide earth, we ransack for; no land, No sea so dangerous, nor so far remote, But we invade to fill the craving throat, And oft neglect whats wholesome, and whats good, Because tis easy, or tis common food; Preferring things bought dearly, and fetcht far, Before all such as in their nature are Useful and good, as if their vertue were Not to be good, but difficult and dear: And therefore choosing rather to endure A restless, then a quiet life and pure. Consider all those things, vvhich you provide To gratifie your humor, lust or pride: Your stately buildings, costly furniture, Imbroyderd garments, made to tempt the viewer; Your gold and silver jewels and your rings, And such unneedful and unuseful things, For vvhich you vainly ransack every nation, Not for necessity, but ostentation; VVith hovv much toyle, and hovv much danger they Must be procur'd and purchas'd for you, nay With hovv much blood and slaughter of poor men, Whom your vain luxury does makes so, vvhen They for their livelyhood must plow the seas, And traverse forreign land meerly to please Your pamperd appetites, and find their grave I'th bosome of an unrelenting wave; Or if they scape the seas, they meet by land Men crueller then waves, or rocks, or sand: And vvhen they are through dangers, costs &amp; pains, Purchas'd and brought, disturb our hearts &amp; brains, And cause dissentions, treacheries and blowes, Murthers &amp; thefts, frauds, rapines, make friends foes, Make brothers bravvle vvith brothers, and inspires Sons vvith unnatural rage against their Sires; Husbands destroy their Spowses, and the wives Break off all bonds &amp; snatch their husbands lives. So did it make Euriphile of old Basely betray her husband for his Gold. Yet vvhen alls done, these costly garments can Warme or defend or dignifie a man, No more then those which only serve for use. Nor do you statly fabricks more conduce Unto our shelter and protection then Those humble Cottages, vvhich old vvise men Built for necessity, to guard and vvarm's Against the rage of rapine or of stormes. Those spacious dishes, and vast goblets too Wherein you riot, not for need, but shew, Though beaten silver, or of massy gold, Can't make the liquor better, which they hold, Nor make the food more wholsome, nor more sweet Nor make you see the poyson you may meet Subtly convey'd into them: Nor d' your heads Or bodies rest more on your downy beds, Nor sleep more soundly 'cause your bedsteads be (What ere you dream) of gold or Ivory. Nay we do often find, those men enjoy More quiet and contented sleep, who lay Their wearied bodies on the humble ground, And with Heaven only canopy de around, Then those can find, who roll their limbs in beds Of down, or spread with Persian Coverleds; Nor is their health, or strength the more, who eat The most delicious, and most costly meat, Then theirs whose diet is but mean and small, To nourish and refresh themselves withall. We see the pamper'd bodies often wax Tender, infirm, unfit for manly Acts. Consumptive, full of pains and maladies, Unknown by persons temperate and wise. For luxury and sloath, how ere it pleases, Serves but to feed Physitians and diseases. Yet what a bustle do men make, what dust To gratifie their palate, pride, and lust? Nay which is more then this, so vile, so vain Mens hearts are grown, and so corrupt their brain, That they pervert the use of things, and bend The Creatures use against the Creatures end. L. Pray Sir who do so? C. You wh' abuse poor Men, Although your fellow Creatures, and have been Made of the self same matter, and inspir'd With the same soul, and form, and have acquir'd The same perfections too, and by their birth, Have as good inter'est in whats here on Earth, As the Great'st He; only by policy, By fraud, or force kept in a low degree, By those that property devis'd, and fram'd Bounds for those things which nature free proclaim'd: So brough degrees into the VVorld, and so Masters and Servants made, and high and low, To gratifie Mens lazyness and pride. Some must be serv'd, ador'd, and deifi'd, Mounted in State and triumph, born along On others shoulders, through th' adorning throng, And the poor slaves, are harness'd for that toyl, And used like beasts; do asses work the while, And those in highest honour with you stand, Who most poor slaves can tread on and command? But you blame me because I do despise, And won't partake of such slight vanities, But live content with what I do enjoy, Not grasping superfluities that cloy, And indispose the mind, and with them bring Cares and vexations, which to them do cling; Nor are they only difficult to gain, But also in the enjoynmet very fain. You don't consider how few things, how small A wise contented man may live withall, With plentty and with comfort; all those things We truly need are few and mean; this brings Your scorn on me, to think or say at least Cause I live so, I live but like a beast. But by that rule the Gods themselves would be, (Cause they want nothing) veryer beasts then we. Consider rightly and you'l clearly find, VVhich is the best way to dispose your mind. Or to want much, or little, tis the fate Of the inferior, and the infirmer State, To want more then the nobler and the strong; Thus to weak infants do more wants belong Then to th' adult; and thus sick persons do VVant more then healthfull; and the women too VVant more then men; and men want more then Gods, For they want nothing. Therefore those, by ods, Approach most neerly to the sacred choice, VVho want the least, and who the least desire. Can you suppose great Hercules, that he VVhom noble acts proclaim'd a Deity, Was in a wretched miserable case, Because without a garment he did trace Th' uneven Earth, and wandred up and down VVithout a purple robe, or costly gown; His body almost naked, only drest In a rough skin tane from a slaughter'd beast; Desiring none of all those trifles that VVe vainly prize, and at so dear a rate? Surely he could not miserable be VVho others did protect from misery; Nor was he poor; his power did extend To sea and Land; whereever he did bend His force, he won the victory, and ne're Met with his conquerour, nor with his Peer. D' you think he wanted garments or such things, Who conquer'd and commanded Lords and Kings? Tis not to be imagin'd; no he was Content and sober in his mind; and as He valour shew'd, he shew'd his temp'rance too, And ne're indulg'd himself (as now men do) With vain delights. Or what say you to me Of Theseus his disciple? was not he King of the Athenians, and most valiant too Of all his stout contemporaries, who By his renowned actions, justly won The reputation of great Neptunes Son? Yet was his body naked, his feet bare, Nor did he shave his beard, or cut his hair. His limbs were hard and hairie, and in that He our bold Ancestors did imitate, Who held a smooth and softly skin to be An argument of Mens effeminacy; And as their actions spoke them men, even so Their plain and simple fashions shew'd them too; They thought a beard mans natural ornament, And Lyons too; and that the Mane was sent For the same end to Horses; and there is In both by nature plac'd a Comelynes, A grace and ornament; these I propose Unto my self to imitate, not those Ridiculous men of this deluded age, VVhose undiscerning fancies do engage Their fond desires to doat on Lushious fare And gorgeous vain attire, and only there Place their imaginary Happiness. For my part I desire not, I profess, My hough should differ from horses, but be Like Houghs as Chirons were, alls one to me. I am the nobler much and happier That no more garments then the Lyons wear; And that my palat does no more require Or choyser delicates then Dogs desire; No better Lodging then the Earth I crave, And for my dwelling house the world I have; And for my diet I provide such meat As without cost or trouble I may eat. That Gold and silver bravely I despise, From the desire whereof all ills arise, That do befall Mankind, seditious jars, Slaughters and treacheries, Rebellion, Wars, Things that n'ere touch my heart, who little have Yet nothing want, nor more then little crave; Thus stands the case with me; and now you know Both my profession, and my practice too; All which is different from Common strains, And from the opinion of Vulgar brains, From whom no wonder we in habit do Differ, since we in Principles do too. But I admire at you, who attribute T' all sorts of Men their habit and their suit; To th' Harper his peculiar garb, and so To the Tragedian his; and yet you do No habit of distinction yet devise Or set apart for vertuous Men or wise, But vainly think it fit that they should go Apparel'd as the fools and Vulgar do, A thing both ill and inconvenient too: And certainly if any habit is Proper for th' good and wise, tis such as this I wear, which the luxurious Gallants hate, And more then Vice scorn and abominate. My garments course, and rough, and made of hair; My hair's unshav'n, and both my feet are bare; Your's are like Pathicks, spruce and finicall, Effeminate Courtiers that annot at all Be from the ront distinguished or known, Nor by your habits difference nor your own. Your garments soft like theirs, and gay like theirs, You wear as many as the gallant wears: As various too in colour and in shapes, As Protean as Jove in all's escapes. So gay your coats, and cloaks, so neat your shoes, To trick and kemb your hair such art you use, And so much time and cost thereon bestow, To curle and powder't for the smel and show, To tempt, and cheat each other, you that wou'd, Have people think your happy, wise and good, Outdo the Vulgar in these vanities, Those Vulgar which so proudly you despise: Yet you must grant that they do'nt come behind, In parts of body, nor in gifts of mind, The gay'st of you, but are as strong to toyle, As stout to fight as you, whom lust can foyle, And wanton pleasures conquer and subdue As soon as those are least esteemd by you. You in your meat, drink, sleep, and your array, Are as luxurious and vain as they; You scorn forsooth to walk a foot, but will By Beasts or by poor men be carry'd still, Whil'st I without relenting can abide Both heats and colds, and what ere can betide Us mortals, and with equal mind I bear All things that God sends down, what ere they are, For which content you count me miserable, Whereas you thriving worldlings are not able So to compose your souls to be content With your condition, but do still relent, Vex, and repine in every State; all that Is present you dislike, still aming at Things absent with great longing; when you lye Cold in the winter you for Summer cry; And when the Summers heat you do obtain, You Summer loath, and winter, court again. Too hot still or too cold, like bodies ill, You are repining and complaining still. The same effects diseases in them do Produce, Your Customes do beget in you: Twixt both this only difference we find, They're in their bodies sick, you in your mind. Yet not content that your own selves are so Misled, you'd tempt and draw in others too To these absurdities and ills, with which You have perplext your lives, led by the itch Of blind desire and custome, not the lawes Of Reason and of Judgment; your lust drawes And hurries you which way it will; you go By violent motion, where you will or no. Like to light bodies swimming on a stream, Your lusts drive you, as does the torrent them; Just as a Rider on an untam'd horse, Is carry'd, not by's will, but th'horses force; Can nor go where he please, nor get on's feet, Whom if one should in his fierce hurry meet, And ask him where he rides, if truth he sayes, His answer must be Where my horse doth please. To the same question you must answer too, Where your affections hurry you, you go. Pleasure sometimes, sometimes ambition drives, And sometimes avarice does rule your lives, Contrary passions work contrary wayes; Fear this way, anger that way, all your dayes You're tost like empty ships from this to that, Desiring still, but ne're agreeing what. You are on many horses mounted, true, All wild and all untamable by you; You climb the craggy rocks, you cross the Seas, Stick at no hard or dangerous passages; No Country so remote, no toyle so great, No danger so apparent, cold or heat, Or pain or hunger frights, or hinders you; If your affections bid you go, you do: While my contemned life keeps me at home Safer, and quieter, then you that rome. I can converse with whom I please, and do VVhat I (that is my reason) prompts me to; The ignorant though rich, I can contemn, And with a free-born mind slight theirs, and them. Th' intemp'rate, and effeminate from me fly, Fearing my habit, and my gravity; The wise, the modest, and the vertuous be The sole companions and delights of me; VVhile I contemn the wanton Men and vain, VVhose glory's in their wealth, attire and train; And bravely can their wealth and them deride, And make my scorn, that which they make their pride. View but the Statutes of the Gods and see If they're not simple-habited like me. In the Barbarians Temples, or the Greeks Who ere the Gods attire and fashion seeks, Shall find their habit, and their beards, and hair, Just as my hair, and beard, and habit are. They are not painted, comb'd, nor trim'd like you, No upper coat made to mislead our view: But one loose simple vest like mine they do Weare both to cover and adorn them too. Therefore henceforth do you slight me no more, Nor yet upbraid me, as you've done before For my plain habit, since the Gods prefer It before all the rest, and for their wear Make choice of this attire, and wisely do Lead us by precept, and example too: Which when thou'st ponder'd well, thoul't find it then, Better to be like Gods, then like vain Men. LI. A paraphrase upon the first Chap. of Ecclesiastes. Thus said the Royall preacher, who did spring From holy David Israels blessed King; All things are vain, most vain, nay vanity, Yea vanity of vanities they be. See how the industrious mortalls toil and care! Look how they travel, how turmoyl'd they are! When their works ended, and their race is run, VVhat profit gain they underneath the Sun? This Generation that appears to day, To morrow vanisheth and fleets away: In whose unstable mansion there comes The next, to fill their Predecessours rooms: And these but come and go; but this vast frame Th' Earth still remains, though not the very same: The glorious Heavenly Charioter new drest, Riseth in burnish'd glory in the East, And circles this vast Globe with constant race, Till it returnes to its first rising place. Th' unconstant wind that now doth southward blow, Anon to th' North from whence it came, will go: It whirleth still about, yet in its change It still returnes from whence it first did range. The posting river, though about it wanders Curling it self in intricate Meanders, Yet with a greedy, and a head-strong motion It runs to its original the Ocean. VVhose vast unsatiate womb it cannot fill; For as its taking, so tis giving still; And by alternate gratitude supplies The thirsty Earth, and makes new streams arise, VVhich by an ever active imitation Return from whence they had origination. Thus in this toilsome fabrick every thing Is full of labour, and doth trouble bring To the still craving Mortal, whose false breast Vainly supposes this a place of rest; And while he toyles his labours to possess, Endures more troubles then he can express. The restless Eye is never satisfied With viewing objects; nor doth th' ear abide Content with hearing; But the senses all Grow by fruition more hydropical; And every fresh enjoyment straight expires, And's buried in the flames of new desires. The thing which hath been in the dayes of yore, Shall be again, and what's now done no more Then what hereafter shall agen be done; And ther's no new thing underneath the Sun; There's no Invention; that which we stile wit, Is but remembrance; and the fruits of it, Are but old things reviv'd. In this round World, All things are by a revolution hurl'd. And though to us they variously appear, There are no things but what already were. VVhat thing is there within this world that we Can justly say is new, and cry Come see? We can't remember things that have been done Ith' Nonage of the World, when time begun: And there will come a time, when those that shall Succeed us, shan't remember us at all; When things that have been or that shall be done, Shall be entomb'd in vast oblivion. I that your Preacher am, was he that sway'd A Royal Scepter, and have been obey'd By th' Israelites, and in Jerusalem Did wear great Judah's Princely Diadem, And us'd my wealth, my power, and strength of mind To seek and search for wisdom, and to find Thereby the causes and effects of all Things done upon this subsolary ball; The works of our great Architect survey'd, The firm foundation which his hand had laid; The various superstructures small and great, Mens labours how they strive to Counterfeit, And in their several postures how they strive To feed, and fence, and keep themselves alive; How they do love and hate, are foes and friends, Upon mistaken grounds, and false self-ends; How they doe do, and undoe, how they pant And tug to kill imaginary want; What they both do and suffer, how and why, Their self-created troubles I did spy: And in my Towring over-search I see Both what Men are, and what they ought to be. A sore and tedious travell to the mind, Which our great God in wisdom has design'd For us poor Sons of mortals, and thought fit That we therein should exercise our wit. All that hath been, and all that hath been done, All Creatures actions underneath the Sun, My searching soul hath seen by contemplation, And lo all's vanity, and the souls vexation: All men, all things are crooked and perverse, Full of defects are it, and they, and theirs, All so imperfect that they're not at all; And (which we may the great'st vexation call) This crookedness cannot be rectifi'd, Nor those defects (though numberless) supply'd. When I'd arrive the very top of all, That the mistaken Mamonists miscall, And think their chiefest blessings; wealth and wit, With all th' additaments that cleave to it: Then did I to my heart Communicate And said; Lo I've attained a vast estate, And do in wisdome far transcend all them That reigned before in Jerusalem; And to compleat the wisdome of my mind, To my large knowledge have experience joyn'd: I did apply my active mind to know Wisdom and folly, nay and madness too: And from th' experience of all, I find All this is but vexation of the mind: For in much wisdom lyes much grief; and those That increase knowledge, do increase their woes. LII. A speech made to the Lord General Monck, at Clotheworkers-Hall in London the 13. of March, 1659. at which time he was there entertained by that worthy Company. Nay then let me come too with my Address, Why mayn't a Rustick promise, or profess His good affection t' you? Why not declare His Wants? how many, and how great they are? And how you may supply them? Since you may See our hearts mourn, although our clothes be gray. Great Hero of three Nations! Whose blood springs From pious and from pow'rfull Grandsire Kings, With whose blood-royal you've enrich'd your veyns, And by continu'd Policy and Pains Have equall'd all their Glory; so that now Three Kingless Scepters to your feet do bow, And court protection, and allyance too; And what great men still reach'd at, stoops to you. But you're too truly Noble to aspire By Fraud or Force to Greatness, or t'acquire Scepters and Crownes by robbery, or base And wilfull breach of Trusts, and Oaths, nor place Your happiness in ravished Dominion, Whose Glory's only founded in opinion, Attended still with danger, fear, and doubt, And fears within, worse then all those without. You must still watch and fear, and think, and must Lose all content, to gratifie one lust, Should you invade the Throne, or aim at Pelf, Throw down three Nations to set up your self; ‘Kings are but royal slaves, and Prisoners too, ‘They alwayes toyl, and alwayes guarded go. You are for making Princes, and can find No work proportion'd to your Pow'r, and mind, But Atlas-like to bear the World, and be The great Restorer of the Liberty Of three long captiv'd Kingdomes, who were thrown By others strong delusions, and their own Misguided zeal, to do and suffer what Their very Souls now grieve and tremble at, Debauch'd by those they thought would teach and rule 'um, Who now they find did ruine and befool 'um. Our meanings still were honest, for alas! We never dream't of what's since come to pass; 'Twas never our intent to violate The setled Orders of the Church or State, To throw down Rulers from their lawfull Seat, Merely to make ambitious small things great, Or to subvert the Lawes; but we thought ther The Laws were good if manag'd by good men; And so we do think still, and find it true, Old lawes did more good, and less harm then ne. And 'twas the plague of Countries and of Citie When that great belly'd house did spawn Committees. We fought not for Religion, for tis known, Poor Men have little, and some great Ones none; Those fevv that love it truly, do vvell knovv, None can take't from us, vvhere vve vvill or no. Nor did vve fight for lavvs, nor had vve need; For if vve had but gold enough to feed Our taking Lawyers, vve had Lawes enough, Without addressing to the sword or Buff. Nor yet for Liberties; for those are things Have cost us more in Keepers, than in Kings. Nor yet for Peace; for if vve had done so, The Souldiers vvould have beat us long ago; Yet vve did fight, and novv vve see for vvhat, To shuffle mens Estates; those ovvners that Before these wars, could call Estates their own, Are beaten out by others that had none. Both Law and Gospel overthrown together, By those who ne're believ'd in, or lov'd either. Our truth, our trade, our peace, our wealth, our freedom, And our full Parliaments, that did get, &amp; breed 'um, Are all devour'd, and by a Monster fell, Whom none, but you, could satisfie, or quell. Your're great, you're good, you're valiant, and you're wise; You have Briareus hands, and Argus eyes; You are our English Champion, you're the true St. George for England, and for Scotland too. ?And? though his storie's question'd much by some, [illeg.]e'r true, or false, this Age and those to come, ?Will? for the future find it so far true, ?That? all vvas but a Prophecy of you; ?And? all his great and high Atchievements be Explain'd by you in this Mythology. Herein you've far out done him; he did fight But vvith one single Dragon: but by your might A Legion have been tam'd, and made to serve The People, whom they mean t' undo and starve. In this you may do higher, and make fame Immortalize your celebrated name, This ages glory, wonder of all after, If you vvould free. the Son, as he the Daughter. FINIS.</field>
