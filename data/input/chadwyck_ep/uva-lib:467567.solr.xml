      <field name="fulltext">POEMS 1869–1879 I Dedication My first gift and my last, to you I dedicate this fascicle of songs— The only wealth I have: Just as they are, to you. I speak the truth in soberness, and say I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes, Had rather hear you praise This bosomful of trifles, Than that the whole, hard world with one consent, In one continuous chorus of applause Poured forth for me and mine The homage of due praise. I write the finis here against my love, This is my love's last epitaph and tomb. Here the road forks, and I Go my way, far from yours. II [Last night, I lingered long without] Last night, I lingered long without My last of loves to see. Alas! the moon-white window-panes Stared blindly back at me. To-day, I hold her very hand, Her very waist embrace— Like clouds across a pool, I read Her thoughts upon her face. And yet, as now, through her clear eyes I seek the inner shrine— I stoop to read her virgin heart, In doubt if it be mine— O looking long and fondly thus, What vision should I see? No vision, but my own white face That grins and mimics me. III After Reading ‘Antony and Cleopatra’ As when the hunt by holt and field Drives on with horn and strife, Hunger of hopeless things pursues Our spirits throughout life. The sea-roar fills us aching full Of objectless desire— The sea-roar, and the white moon-shine, And the reddening of the fire. Who talks to me of reason now? It would be more delight To have died in Cleopatra's arms Than be alive to-night. IV Spring-Song The air was full of sun and birds, The fresh air sparkled clearly. Remembrance wakened in my heart And I knew I loved her dearly. The fallows and the leafless trees And all my spirit tingled. My earliest thought of love, and spring's First puff of perfume mingled. In my still heart, the thoughts awoke Came bone by bone together— Say, birds and sun and spring, is love A mere affair of weather? V [As Love and Hope together] As Love and Hope together Walk by me for a while, Link-armed the ways they travel For many a pleasant mile— Link-armed and dumb they travel— They sing not, but they smile. Hope leaving, Love commences To practise on the lute; And as he sings and travels With lingering, laggard foot, Despair plays obligato The sentimental flute. Until, in singing garments, Comes royally, at call— Comes limber-hipped Indiff'rence Free-stepping, straight and tall— Comes singing and lamenting— The sweetest pipe of all. VI Duddingston I With caws and chirrupings, the woods In this thin sun rejoice, The Psalm seems but the little kirk That sings with its own voice. The cloud-rifts share their amber light With the surface of the mere— I think the very stones are glad To feel each other near. Once more my whole heart leaps and swells And gushes o'er with glee: The fingers of the sun and shade Touch music stops in me. II Now fancy paints that bygone day When you were here, my fair— The whole lake rang with rapid skates In the windless, winter air. You leaned to me, I leaned to you, Our course was smooth as flight— We steered—a heel-touch to the left, A heel-touch to the right. We swung our way through flying men, Your hand lay fast in mine, We saw the shifting crowd dispart, The level ice-reach shine. I swear by yon swan-travelled lake, By yon calm hill above, I swear had we been drowned that day We had been drowned in love. VII [The relic taken, what avails the shrine?] The relic taken, what avails the shrine? The locket, pictureless? O heart of mine, Art thou not less than that, Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat. Her image nestled closer at my heart Than cherished memories, healed every smart, And warmed it more than wine Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine. This was the little weather-gleam that lit The cloudy promontories. The real charm was it That gilded hills and woods And walked beside me through the solitudes. That sun is set. My heart is widowed now Of that companion-thought. Alone I plough The seas of life, and trace A separate furrow far from her and grace. VIII [All things on earth and sea] All things on earth and sea, All that the white stars see, Turns about you and me. And where we two are not, Is darkness like a blot And life and love forgot. But when we pass that way, The night breaks into day, The year breaks into May. The earth through all her bowers Carols and breathes and flowers About this love of ours. IX [I sit up here at midnight] I sit up here at midnight, The wind is in the street, The rain besieges the windows Like the sound of many feet. I see the street lamps flicker, I see them wink and fail, The streets are wet and empty, It blows an easterly gale. Some think of the fisher skipper Beyond the Inchcape stone; But I of the fisher woman That lies at home alone. She raises herself on her elbow And watches the firelit floor; Her eyes are bright with terror, Her heart beats fast and sore. Between the roar of the flurries, When the tempest holds his breath She holds her breathing also— It is all as still as death. She can hear the cinders dropping, The cat that purrs in its sleep— The foolish fisher woman! Her heart is on the deep. X [I am a hunchback, yellow faced—] I am a hunchback, yellow faced— A hateful sight to see— Tis all that other men can do To pass and let me be. I am a woman—my hair is white— I was a drunkard's lass; The gin dances in my head— I stumble as I pass. I am a man that God made at first, And teachers tried to harm; Here, hunchback, take my friendly hand— Good woman, take my arm. XI Death We are as maidens one and all, In some shut convent place, Pleased with the flowers, the service bells, The cloister's shady grace, That whiles, with fearful, fluttering hearts, Look outward thro' the grate And down the long, white road, up which, Some morning, soon or late, Shall canter on his great, gray horse That splendid acred Lord Who comes to lead us forth—his wife, But half with our accord. With fearful fluttered hearts, we wait— We meet him, bathed in tears, We are so loath to leave behind Those tranquil Convent years, So loath to meet the pang, to take (On some poor chance of bliss) Life's labour on the windy sea For a bower as still as this. Weeping we mount the crowded aisle, And weeping after us The Bridesmaids follow—Come to me! I will not meet you thus, Pale rider to the Convent gate, Come, O rough bridegroom, Death, Where, bashful bride, I wait you veiled, Flush-faced, with shaken breath. I do not fear your kiss. I dream New days, secure from strife, And, bride-like, in the future hope A quiet household life. XII [A little before me, and hark!] A little before me, and hark! The dogs in the village bark. And see, in the blank of the dark, The eye of a window shine! There stands the inn, the small and rude, In this earth's vast robber-wood The inn with the beds and the food, The inn of the shining wine. We do but bait on life's bare plain, And through the new day's joy and pain Reach to the baiting place again. O rest, for the night, be mine! Rest for the night! For to love and rest, To clasp the hands, to keep the nest, Are only human at the best: To move and to suffer divine. XIII Epistle to Charles Baxter Reaped grain should fill the reaper's grange, My fate for thine I would not change. Thy pathway would to me be strange, And strange to thee The limits of the daily range That pleases me. For me, I do but ask such grace As Icarus. Bright breathing space— One glorious moment—face to face, The sun and he! The next, fit grave for all his race, The splendid sea. The father, rich in forty years Of poor experience culled in tears, Meanly restrained by sordid fears Went limping home And hung his pinions by the spears, No more to roam. O more to me a thousand fold The son's brief triumph, wisely bold To separate from the common fold, The general curse, The accustomed way of growing old And growing worse. O happy lot! A heart of fire, In the full flush of young desire, Not custom-taught to shun the mire And hold the wall, His sole experience to aspire, To soar and fall. His golden hap it was to go Straight from the best of life below To life above. Not his to know, O greatly blest, How deadly weary life can grow To e'en the best. Sad life, whose highest lore, in vain The nobler summits to attain, Still bids me draw the kindly strain Of love more tight, And ease my individual pain In your delight. For I, that would be blythe and merry, Prefer to call Marsala sherry, When duty-bound to cross the ferry Believe it smooth, And under pleasant fictions bury Distasteful truth. And hence I banish wisdom, set The sole imperial coronet On cheerful Folly, at regret Pull many a mouth, Drown care in jovial bouts—and yet Sigh for the South! O South, South, South! O happy land! Thou beckon'st me with phantom hand. Sweet Memories at my bedside stand All night in tears. The roar upon thy nightly strand Yet fills mine ears. The young grass sparkles in the breeze, The pleasant sunshine warms my knees, The buds are thick upon the trees, The clouds float high. We sit out here in perfect ease— My pipe and I. Fain would I be, where (winter done) By dusty roads and noontide sun, The soldiers, straggling one by one, Marched disarrayed And spoiled the hedge, till every gun A Rose displayed. Or, O flower-land, I would be where (The trivial, well-beloved affair!) The bird-watch drew with gentle care From up his sleeve And gave me, fluttering from the snare, A Mange-Olive. Aye, dear to me the slightest tie That binds my heart to thee, O high And sovereign land for whom I sigh In pain to see The Springtime come again, and I So far from thee! But hush! the clear-throat blackbird sings From haugh and hill the Season brings Great armfuls of delightful things To stop my mouth Though still (caged-bird) I beat my wings Toward the South. XIV Consolation Though he, that ever kind and true, Kept stoutly step by step with you Your whole long gusty lifetime through, Be gone a while before, Be now a moment gone before, Yet, doubt not, soon the seasons shall restore Your friend to you. He has but turned a corner—still He pushes on with right good will, Through mire and marsh, by heugh and hill, That self-same arduous way— That self-same upland, hopeful way, That you and he through many a doubtful day Attempted still. He is not dead, this friend—not dead, But in the path we mortals tread Got some few, trifling steps ahead And nearer to the end; So that you too, once past the bend, Shall meet again, as face to face, this friend You fancy dead. Push gaily on, strong heart! The while You travel forward mile by mile, He loiters with a backward smile Till you can overtake, And strains his eyes to search his wake, Or whistling, as he sees you through the brake, Waits on a stile. XV To Sydney Not thine where marble-still and white Old statues share the tempered light And mock the uneven modern flight, But in the stream Of daily sorrow and delight To seek a theme. I too, O friend, have steeled my heart Boldly to choose the better part, To leave the beaten ways of art And wholly free To dare, beyond the scanty chart, The deeper sea. All vain restrictions left behind, Frail bark! I loose my anchored mind And large, before the prosperous wind Desert the strand— A new Columbus sworn to find The morning land. Nor too ambitious, friend. To thee I own my weakness. Not for me To sing the enfranchised nations' glee, Or count the cost Of warships foundered far at sea And battles lost. High on the far-seen, sunny hills, Morning-content my bosom fills; Well-pleased, I trace the wandering rills And learn their birth. Far off, the clash of sovereign wills May shake the earth. The nimble circuit of the wheel, The uncertain poise of merchant weal, Horror of famine, fire and steel When nations fall; These, heedful, from afar I feel— I mark them all. But not, my friend, not these I sing, My voice shall fill a narrower ring. Tired souls, that flag upon the wing, I seek to cheer: Brave wines to strengthen hope I bring, Life's cantineer! Some song that shall be suppling oil To weary muscles strained with toil, Shall hearten for the daily moil, Or widely read Make sweet for him that tills the soil His daily bread— Such songs in my flushed hours I dream (High thought), instead of armour gleam Or warrior cantos ream by ream To load the shelves— Songs with a lilt of words, that seem To sing themselves. XVI [O dull, cold northern sky] O dull, cold northern sky, O brawling sabbath bells, O feebly twittering Autumn bird that tells The year is like to die! O still, spoiled trees, O city ways, O sun desired in vain, O dread presentiment of coming rain That clogs the sullen days! Thee, heart of mine, I greet. In what hard mountain pass Striv'st thou? In what importunate morass Sink now thy weary feet? Thou run'st a hopeless race To win despair. No crown Awaits success; but leaden gods look down On thee, with evil face. And those that would befriend And cherish thy defeat, With angry welcome shall turn sour the sweet Home-coming of the end. Yea, those that offer praise To idleness, shall yet Insult thee, coming glorious in the sweat Of honourable ways. XVII [Swallows travel to and fro] Swallows travel to and fro, And the great winds come and go, And the steady breezes blow, Bearing perfume, bearing love. Breezes hasten, swallows fly, Towered clouds forever ply, And at noonday you and I See the same sun shine above. Dew and rain fall everywhere, Harvests ripen, flowers are fair, And the whole round earth is bare To the moonshine and the sun; And the live air, fanned with wings, Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings Into contact distant things, And makes all the countries one. Let us wander where we will, Something kindred greets us still; Something seen on vale or hill Falls familiar on the heart; So, at scent or sound or sight, Severed souls by day and night Tremble with the same delight— Tremble, half the world apart. XVIII [Let Love go, if go she will.] Let Love go, if go she will. Seek not, O fool, her wanton flight to stay. Of all she gives and takes away The best remains behind her still. The best remains behind: in vain Joy may she give and take again, Joy she may take and leave us pain, If yet she leave behind The constant mind To meet all fortunes nobly, to endure All things with a good heart, and still be pure. Still to be foremost in the foremost cause, And still be worthy of the love that was. Love coming is omnipotent indeed, But not Love going. Let her go. The seed Springs in the favouring Summer air, and grows, And waxes strong; and when the Summer goes Remains, a perfect tree. Joy she may give and take again, Joy she may take and leave us pain. O Love, and what care we? For one thing thou hast given O Love, one thing Is ours that nothing can remove; And as the King discrowned is still a King, The unhappy lover still preserves his love. XIX [I am like one that for long days had sate] I am like one that for long days had sate, With seaward eyes set keen against the gale, On some long foreland, watching, sail by sail, The portbound ships for one ship that was late; And sail by sail, his heart burned up with joy, And cruelly was quenched, until at last One ship, the looked-for pennant at its mast, Bore gaily, and dropt safely past the buoy; And lo! the loved one was not there, was dead. Then would he watch no more; no more the sea With myriad vessels, sail by sail, perplex His eyes and mock his longing. Weary head, Take now thy rest; eyes, close; for no more me Shall hope untried elate, or ruined vex. For thus on love I waited; thus for love Strained all my senses eagerly and long; Thus for her coming ever trimmed my song; Till in the far skies coloured as a dove, A bird gold-coloured flickered far and fled Over the pathless water waste for me; And with spread hands I watched the bright bird flee And waited, till before me she dropped dead. O golden bird in these dove-coloured skies How long I sought, how long with wearied eyes I sought, O bird, the promise of thy flight! And now the morn has dawned, the morn has died, The day has come and gone; and once more night About my lone life settles, wild and wide. XX [The roadside lined with ragweed, the sharp hills] The roadside lined with ragweed, the sharp hills Standing against the glow of eve, the patch Of rough white oats 'mongst darkling granite knolls, The ferny coverts where the adders hatch, The hollow that the northern sea upfills, The seagull wheeling by with strange, sad calls, All these, this evening, weary me. Full fain Would I turn up the little elm tree way And under the last elm tree, once again Stretch myself with my head among the grass; So lying, tyne the memories of day And let my loosed, insatiate being pass Into the blackbird's song of summer ease, Or, with the white moon, rise in spirit from the trees. XXI [Not undelightful, friend, our rustic ease] Not undelightful, friend, our rustic ease To grateful hearts; for by especial hap Deep nested in the hill's enormous lap With its own ring of walls and grove of trees Sits, in deep shelter, our small cottage; nor Far-off is seen, rose carpeted and hung With Clematis, the quarry whence she sprung. O matre pulchra filia pulchrior. Thither in early spring, unharnessed folk, We join the pairing swallows, glad to stay Where, bosomed in high hills, remote, unseen, From its tall trees, it breathes a slender smoke To heaven, and in the noon of sultry day Stands, coolly buried, to the neck in green. XXII [As Daniel, burd-alone, in that far land] As Daniel, burd-alone, in that far land, Kneeling in fervent prayer with heart-sick eyes Turned thro' the casement toward the westering skies; Or as untamed Elijah, that red brand Among the starry prophets; or that band And company of Faithful sanctities, Who, in all times, when persecutions rise, Cherish forgotten creeds with fostering hand; Such do ye seem to me, light-hearted crew, O turned to friendly arts with all your will, That keep a little chapel sacred still, One rood of Holy-land in this bleak earth Sequestered still (our homage surely due!) To the twin Gods of mirthful wine and mirth. XXIII The Light-Keeper I The brilliant kernel of the night, The flaming lightroom circles me: I sit within a blaze of light Held high above the dusky sea. Far off the surf doth break and roar Along bleak miles of moonlit shore, Where through the tides the tumbling wave Falls in an avalanche of foam And drives its churned waters home Up many an undercliff and cave. The clear bell chimes: the clockworks strain, The turning lenses flash and pass, Frame turning within glittering frame With frosty gleam of moving glass: Unseen by me, each dusky hour The sea-waves welter up the tower Or in the ebb subside again; And ever and anon all night, Drawn from afar by charm of light, A sea bird beats against the pane. And lastly when dawn ends the night And belts the semi-orb of sea, The tall, pale pharos in the light Looks white and spectral as may be. The early ebb is out: the green Straight belt of seaweed now is seen, That round the basement of the tower Marks out the interspace of tide; And watching men are heavy-eyed, And sleepless lips are dry and sour. The night is over like a dream: The sea-birds cry and dip themselves: And in the early sunlight, steam The newly bared and dripping shelves, Around whose verge the glassy wave With lisping wash is heard to lave; While, on the white tower lifted high, The circling lenses flash and pass With yellow light in faded glass And sickly shine against the sky. II As the steady lenses circle With a frosty gleam of glass; And the clear bell chimes, And the oil brims over the lip of the burner, Quiet and still at his desk, The lonely Light-Keeper Holds his vigil. Lured from far, The bewildered seagull beats Dully against the lantern; Yet he stirs not, lifts not his head From the desk where he reads, Lifts not his eyes to see The chill blind circle of night Watching him through the panes. This is his country's guardian, The outmost sentry of peace. This is the man Who gives up that is lovely in living For the means to live. Poetry cunningly gilds The life of the Light-Keeper, Held on high in the blackness In the burning kernel of night, The seaman sees and blesses him, The Poet, deep in a sonnet, Numbers his inky fingers Fitly to praise him. Only we behold him, Sitting, patient and stolid, Martyr to a salary. XXIV [My brain swims empty and light] My brain swims empty and light Like a nut on a sea of oil; And an atmosphere of quiet Wraps me about from the turmoil and clamour of life. I stand apart from living, Apart and holy I stand, In my new-gained growth of idleness, I stand, As stood the Shekinah of yore in the holy of holies. I walk the streets smoking my pipe And I love the dallying shop-girl That leans with rounded stern to look at the fashions; And I hate the bustling citizen, The eager and hurrying man of affairs I hate, Because he bears his intolerance writ on his face And every movement and word of him tells me how much he hates me. I love night in the city, The lighted streets and the swinging gait of harlots. I love cool pale morning, In the empty bye-streets, With only here and there a female figure, A slavey with lifted dress and the key in her hand, A girl or two at play in a corner of waste-land Tumbling and showing their legs and crying out to me loosely. XXV The Cruel Mistress Here let me rest, here nurse the uneasy qualm That yearns within me; And to the heaped-up sea, Sun-spangled in the quiet afternoon, Sing my devotions. In the sun, at the edge of the down, The whin-pods crackle In desultory volleys; And the bank breathes in my face Its hot sweet breath— Breath that stirs and kindles, Lights that suggest, not satisfy— Is there never in life or nature An opiate for desire? Has everything here a voice, Saying ‘I am not the goal; Nature is not to be looked at alone; Her breath, like the breath of a mistress, Her breath also, Parches the spirit with longing Sick and enervating longing.’ Well, let the matter rest. I rise and brush the windle-straws Off my clothes; and lighting another pipe Stretch myself over the down. Get thee behind me, Nature! I turn my back on the sun And face from the grey new town at the foot of the bay. I know an amber lady Who has her abode At the lips of the street In prisons of coloured glass. I had rather die of her love Than sicken for you, O Nature! Better be drunk and merry Than dreaming awake! Better be Falstaff than Obermann! XXVI Storm The narrow lanes are vacant and wet; The rough wind bullies and blusters about the township. And spins the vane on the tower And chases the scurrying leaves, And the straw in the damp innyard. See—a girl passes Tripping gingerly over the pools, And under her lifted dress I catch the gleam of a comely, stockinged leg. Pah! the room stifles me, Reeking of stale tobacco— With the four black mealy horrible prints After Landseer's pictures. I will go out. Here the free wind comes with a fuller circle, Sings, like an angry wasp, in the straining grass, Sings and whistles; And the hurried flow of rain Scourges my face and passes. Behind me, clustered together, the rain-wet roofs of the town Shine, and the light vane shines as it veers In the long pale finger of sun that hurries across them to me. The fresh salt air is keen in my nostrils, And far down the shining sand Foam and thunder And take the shape of the bay in eager mirth The white-head hungry billows. The earth shakes As the semicircle of waters Stoops and casts itself down; And far outside in the open, Wandering gleams of sunshine Show us the ordered horde that hurries to follow. Ei! merry companions, Your madness infects me. My whole soul rises and falls and leaps and tumbles with you! I shout aloud and incite you, O white-headed merry companions. The sight of you alone is better than drinking. The brazen band is loosened from off my forehead; My breast and my brain are moistened and cool; And still I yell in answer To your hoarse inarticulate voices, O big, strong, bullying, boisterous waves, That are of all things in nature the nearest thoughts to human, Because you are wicked and foolish, Mad and destructive. XXVII Stormy Nights I cry out war to those who spend their utmost, Trying to substitute a vain regret For childhood's vanished moods, Instead of a full manly satisfaction In new development. Their words are vain as the lost shouts, The wasted breath of solitary hunters That are far buried in primeval woods— Clamour that dies in silence, Cries that bring back no answer But the great voice of the wind-shaken forest, Mocking despair. No—they will get no answer; For I too recollect, I recollect and love my perished childhood, Perfectly love and keenly recollect; I too remember; and if it could be Would not recall it. Do I not know, how, nightly, on my bed The palpable close darkness shutting round me, How my small heart went forth to evil things, How all the possibilities of sin That were yet present to my innocence Bound me too narrowly, And how my spirit beat The cage of its compulsive purity; How—my eyes fixed, My shot lip tremulous between my fingers I fashioned for myself new modes of crime, Created for myself with pain and labour The evil that the cobwebs of society, The comely secrecies of education, Had made an itching mystery to meward. Do I not know again, When the great winds broke loose and went abroad At night in the lighted town— Ah! then it was different— Then, when I seemed to hear The storm go by me like a cloak-wrapt horseman Stooping over the saddle— Go by, and come again and yet again, Like some one riding with a pardon, And ever baffled, ever shut from passage: Then when the house shook and a horde of noises Came out and clattered over me all night, Then, would my heart stand still, My hair creep fearfully upon my head And, with my tear-wet face Buried among the bed-clothes, Long and bitterly would I pray and wrestle Till gentle sleep Threw her great mantle over me, And my hard breathing gradually ceased. I was then the Indian, Well and happy and full of glee and pleasure, Both hands full of life. And not without divine impulses Shot into me by the untried non-ego; But, like the Indian, too, Not yet exempt from feverish questionings, And on my bed of leaves, Writhing terribly in grasp of terror, As when the still stars and the great white moon Watch me athwart black foliage, Trembling before the interminable vista, The widening wells of space In which my thought flags like a wearied bird In the mid ocean of his autumn flight— Prostrate before the indefinite great spirit That the external warder Plunged like a dagger Into my bosom. Now, I am a Greek White-robed among the sunshine and the statues And the fair porticos of carven marble— Fond of olives and dry sherry, Good tobacco and clever talk with my fellows, Free from inordinate cravings. Why would you hurry me, O evangelist, You with the bands and the shilling packet of tracts Greatly reduced when taken for distribution? Why do you taunt my progress, O green-spectacled Wordsworth! in beautiful verses, You, the elderly poet? So I shall travel forward Step by step with the rest of my race, In time, if death should spare me, I shall come on to a farther stage, And show you St Francis of Assisi. XXVIII Song at Dawn I see the dawn creep round the world, Here damm'd a moment backward by great hills, There racing o'er the sea. Down at the round equator, It leaps forth straight and rapid, Driving with firm sharp edge the night before it. Here gradually it floods The wooded valleys and the weeds And the still smokeless cities. The cocks crow up at the farms; The sick man's spirit is glad; The watch treads brisker about the dew-wet deck; The light-keeper locks his desk, As the lenses turn, Faded and yellow. The girl with the embroidered shift Rises and leans on the sill, And her full bosom heaves Drinking deep of the silentness. I too rise and watch The healing fingers of dawn— I too drink from its eyes The unaccountable peace— I too drink and am satisfied as with food. Fain would I go Down by the winding crossroad by the trees, Where at the corner of wet wood The blackbird in the early grey and stillness Wakes his first song. Peace, who can make verses clink, Find ictus following surely after ictus, At such an hour as this, the heart Lies steeped and silent. O dreaming, leaning girl, Already are the sovereign hill-tops ruddy, Already the grey passes, the white streak Brightens above dark woodlands, Day begins. XXIX Nous n'irons plus aux bois We'll walk the woods no more, But stay beside the fire, To weep for old desire And things that are no more. The woods are spoiled and hoar, The ways are full of mire; We'll walk the woods no more, But stay beside the fire. We loved, in days of yore, Love, laughter, and the lyre. Ah God, but death is dire, And death is at the door— We'll walk the woods no more. XXX [In Autumn when the woods are red] In Autumn when the woods are red And skies are grey and clear, The sportsmen seek the wild fowls' bed Or follow down the deer; And Cupid hunts by haugh and head, By riverside and mere, I walk, not seeing where I tread And keep my heart with fear, Sir, have an eye, on where you tread, And keep your heart with fear, For something lingers here; A touch of April not yet dead, In Autumn when the woods are red And skies are grey and clear. XXXI [Love is the very heart of Spring] Love is the very heart of Spring; Flocks fall to loving on the lea And wildfowl love upon the wing, When Spring first enters like a sea. When Spring first enters like a sea Into the heart of everything; Bestir yourselves religiously, Incense before love's altar bring. Incense before love's altar bring, Flowers from the flowering hawthorn tree, Flowers from the margin of the spring, For all the flowers are sweet to see. Love is the very heart of Spring; When Spring first enters like a sea Incense before love's altar bring, And flowers while flowers are sweet to see. Bring flowers while flowers are sweet to see. Love is almighty, love's a King, Incense before love's altar bring, Incense before love's altar bring. Love's gifts are generous and free When Spring first enters like a sea; When Spring first enters like a sea, The birds are all inspired to sing. Love is the very heart of Spring, The birds are all inspired to sing, Love's gifts are generous and free, Love is almighty, love's a King. XXXII [I who all the winter through] I who all the winter through, Cherished other loves than you, And kept hands with hoary policy in marriage bed and pew; Now I know the false and true, For the earnest sun looks through, And my old love comes to meet me in the dawning and the dew. Now the hedged meads renew Rustic odour, smiling hue, And the clean air shines and twinkles as the world goes wheeling through; And my heart springs up anew, Bright and confident and true, And my old love comes to meet me in the dawning and the dew. XXXIII [Here you rest among the vallies, maiden known to but a few] Here you rest among the vallies, maiden known to but a few; Here you sleep unsighing, but how oft of yore you sighed! And how oft your feet elastic trod a measure in the dew On a green beside the river ere you died! Where are now the country lovers whom you trembled to be near— Who, with shy advances, in the falling eventide, Grasped thee tightlier at your fingers, whispered lowlier in your ear, On a green beside the river ere you died? All the sweet old country dancers who went round with you in tune, Dancing, flushed and silent, in the silent eventide, All departed by enchantment at the rising of the moon From the green beside the river when you died. XXXIV [There where the land of love] There where the land of love, Grown about by fragrant bushes, Sunken in a winding valley, Where the clear winds blow And the shadows come and go, And the cattle stand and low And the sheep bells and the linnets Sing and tinkle musically. Between the past and the future, Those two black infinities Between which our brief life Flashes a moment and goes out. XXXV [Love—what is love? A great and aching heart] Love—what is love? A great and aching heart Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair. Life—what is life? Upon a moorland bare To see love coming and see love depart. XXXVI [Death, to the dead for evermore] Death, to the dead for evermore A King, a God, the last, the best of friends— Whene'er this mortal journey ends Death, like a host, comes smiling to the door; Smiling, he greets us, on that tranquil shore Where neither piping bird nor peeping dawn Disturbs the eternal sleep, But in the stillness far withdrawn Our dreamless rest for evermore we keep. For as from open windows forth we peep Upon the night-time star beset And with dews for ever wet; So from this garish life the spirit peers; And lo! as a sleeping city, death outspread, Where breathe the sleepers evenly; and lo! After the loud wars, triumphs, trumpets, tears And clamour of man's passion, Death appears And we must rise and go. Soon are eyes tired with sunshine, soon the ears Weary of utterance, seeing all is said; Soon, racked by hopes and fears, The all-pondering, all-contriving head, Weary with all things, wearies of the years; And our sad spirits turn toward the dead; And the tired child, the body, longs for bed. XXXVII [I saw red evening through the rain] I saw red evening through the rain, Lower above the steaming plain; I heard the hour strike small and still, From the black belfry on the hill. Thought is driven out of doors to-night By bitter memory of delight; The sharp constraint of finger tips, Or the shuddering touch of lips. I heard the hour strike small and still, From the black belfry on the hill. Behind me I could still look down On the outspread monstrous town. The sharp constraint of finger tips Or the shuddering touch of lips, And all old memories of delight Crowd upon my soul to-night. Behind me I could still look down On the outspread feverish town; But before me still and grey And lonely was the forward way. XXXVIII The Daughter of Herodias Three yellow slaves were set to swing The doorway curtain to and fro, With rustle of light folds and ring Of little bells that hung below; The still, hot night was tempered so. And ever, from the carven bed, She watched the labour of the men; And saw the band of moonlight spread, Leap up upon her feet and then Leap down upon the floor again; And ever, vexed with heat and doubt, Below the burthen of their shawls, The still grey olives saw without And glimmer of white garden walls, Between the alternate curtain falls. What ailed the dainty lady then, The dainty lady, fair and sweet? Unseen of these three silent men, A something lay upon her feet, Not comely for such eyes to meet. She saw a golden salver there And, laid upon it, on the bed, The white teeth showing keen and bare Between the sundered lips, a head Sallow and horrible and dead. She saw upon the sallow cheek Rust-coloured blood-stains; and the eye Her frightened glances seemed to seek Half-lifting its blue lid on high, Watching her, horrible and sly. Thus spake she: ‘Once again that head! I ate too much pilau to-night, My mother and the eunuchs said. Well, I can take a hint aright— To-morrow's supper shall be light.’ XXXIX [As one who having wandered all night long] As one who having wandered all night long In a perplexed forest, comes at length, In the first hours, about the matin song, And when the sun uprises in his strength, To the fringed margin of the wood, and sees, Gazing afar before him, many a mile Of falling country, many fields and trees, And cities and bright streams and far-off Ocean's smile: I, O Melampus, halting, stand at gaze; I, liberated, look abroad on life, Love, and distress, and dusty travelling ways, The steersman's helm, the surgeon's helpful knife, Or the lone ploughman's earth-upturning share, The revelry of cities and the sound Of seas, and mountain-tops aloof in air, And of the circling earth the unsupported round: I, looking, wonder: I, intent, adore; And, O Melampus, reaching forth my hands In adoration, cry aloud and soar In spirit, high above the supine lands And the low cares of mortal things, and flee To the last fields of the universe untrod, Where is nor man, nor any earth, nor sea, And the contented soul is all alone with God. XL Praise and Prayer I have been well, I have been ill, I have been rich and poor; I have set my back against the wall And fought it by the hour; I have been false, I have been true; And thoro' grief and mirth, I have done all that man can do To be a man of worth; And now, when from an unknown shore, I dare an unknown wave, God, who has helped me heretofore, O help me wi' the lave! XLI John Cavalier These are your hills, John Cavalier. Your father's kids you tended here, And grew, among these mountains wild, A humble and religious child. Fate turned the wheel; you grew and grew; Bold Marshals doffed the hat to you; God whispered counsels in your ear To guide your sallies, Cavalier. You shook the earth with martial tread; The ensigns fluttered by your head; In Spain or France, Velay or Kent, The music sounded as you went. Much would I give if I might spy Your brave battalions marching by; Or, on the wind, if I might hear Your drums and bugles, Cavalier. In vain. O'er all the windy hill, The ways are void, the air is still, Alone, below the echoing rock, The shepherd calls upon his flock. The wars of Spain and of Cevennes, The bugles and the marching men, The horse you rode for many a year— Where are they now, John Cavalier? All armies march the selfsame way Far from the cheerful eye of day; And you and yours marched down below About two hundred years ago. Over the hills, into the shade, Journeys each mortal cavalcade; Out of the sound, out of the sun, They go when their day's work is done; And all shall doff the bandoleer To sleep with dead John Cavalier. XLII The Iron Steed In our black stable by the sea, Five and twenty stalls you see— Five and twenty strong are we: The lanterns tossed the shadows round, Live coals were scattered on the ground, The swarthy ostlers echoing stept, But silent all night long we slept. Inactive we, steeds of the day, The shakers of the mountains, lay. Earth's oldest veins our dam and sire, Iron chimeras fed with fire. All we, the unweary, lay at rest; The sleepless lamp burned on our crest; And in the darkness far and nigh, We heard our iron compeers cry: Soon as the day began to spring . . . XLIII [Of where or how, I nothing know] Of where or how, I nothing know, And why I do not care. Enough if even so, My travelling eyes, my travelling mind can go By flood and field and hill, by wood and meadow fair, Beside the Susquehanna and along the Delaware. I think, I hope, I dream no more The dreams of otherwhere, The cherished thoughts of yore; I have been changed from what I was before; Or breathed perchance too deep the lotus of the air Beside the Susquehanna and along the Delaware. Though westward steers the train, my soul Shall for the East declare; Shall take the East for goal, Outward and upward bound; and still shall roll, And still unconquered live, as now she spurns despair Beside the Susquehanna and along the Delaware. Unweary God me yet shall bring To lands of brighter air, Where I, now half a king, Shall with superior spirit loudlier sing, And wear a bolder front than that which now I wear Beside the Susquehanna and along the Delaware PIECES IN LALLAN I To The Commissioners of Northern Lights, with a Paper I send to you, commissioners, A paper that may please ye, sirs, (For troth they say it micht be worse An' I believ't) And on your business lay my curse Before I leav't. I thocht I'd serve wi' you, sirs, yince, But I've thocht better of it since; The maitter I will nowise mince, But tell ye true: I'll service wi' some ither prince, An' no' wi' you. I've no' been very deep, ye'll think, Cam' delicately to the brink An' when the water gart me shrink Straucht took the rue, An' didna stoop my fill to drink— I own it true. I kent on cape and isle, a light Burnt fair an' clearly ilka night; But at the service I took fright, As sune's I saw, An' being still a neophite Gaed straucht awa'. Anither course I now begin, The weeg I'll cairry for my sin, The court my voice sall echo in, An'—wha can tell?— Some ither day I may be yin O' you mysel'. II To Mesdames Zassetsky and Garschine The wind may blaw the lee-lang way And aye the lift be mirk an' gray, An' deep the moss and steigh the brae Where a' maun gang— There's still an hoor in ilka day For luve and sang. And canty hearts are strangly steeled. By some dikeside they'll find a bield, Some couthy neuk by muir or field They're sure to hit, Where, frae the blatherin' wind concealed, They'll rest a bit. An' weel for them if kindly fate Send ower the hills to them a mate; They'll crack a while o' kirk an' State, O' yowes an' rain: And when it's time to tak' the gate, Tak' ilk his ain. —Sic neuk beside the southern sea I soucht—sic place o' quiet lee Frae a' the winds o' life. To me, Fate, rarely fair, Had set a freendly company To meet me there. Kindly by them they gart me sit, An' blythe was I to bide a bit. Licht as o' some hame fireside lit My life for me. —Ower early maun I rise an' quit This happy lee. III To Charles Baxter Noo lyart leaves blaw ower the green, Reid are the bonny woods o' Dean, An' here we're back in Embro, frien', To pass the winter. Whilk noo, wi' frosts afore, draws in, An' snaws ahint her. I've seen 's hae days to fricht us a', The Pentlands poothered weel wi' snaw, The ways half smoored wi' liquid thaw An' half congealin', The snell an' scowtherin' norther blaw Frae blae Brunteelan'. I've seen 's been unco sweir to sally And at the door-cheeks daff an' dally— Seen 's daidle thus an' shilly-shally For near a minute— Sae cauld the wind blew up the valley, The deil was in it!— Syne spread the silk an' tak the gate, In blast an' blaudin' rain, deil hae 't! The hale toon glintin', stane an' slate, Wi' cauld an' weet, An' to the Court, gin we 'se be late, Bicker oor feet. And at the Court, tae, aft I saw Whaur Advocates by twa an' twa Gang gesterin' end to end the ha' In weeg an' goon, To crack o' what ye wull but Law The hale forenoon. That muckle ha', maist like a kirk, I've kent at braid mid-day sae mirk Ye'd seen white weegs an' faces lurk Like ghaists frae Hell, But whether Christian ghaists or Turk Deil ane could tell. The three fires lunted in the gloom, The wind blew like the blast o' doom, The rain upo' the roof abune Played Peter Dick— Ye wad nae'd licht enough i' the room Your teeth to pick! But, freend, ye ken how me an' you, The ling-lang lanely winter through, Keep'd a guid speerit up, an' true To lore Horatian, We aye the ither bottle drew— To inclination. Sae let us in the comin' days Stand sicker on oor auncient ways— The strauchtest road in a' the maze Since Eve ate apples; An' let the winter weet oor cla'es— We'll weet oor thrapples. IV To the Same [Charles Baxter] On the death of their common friend, Mr John Adam, Clerk of Court An' Johnie's deid. The mair's the pity! He's deid, an' deid o' Aqua-vitae. O Embro', you're a shrunken city, Noo Johnie's deid! Tak hands, an' sing a burial ditty Ower Johnie's heid. To see him was baith drink an' meat, Gaun linkin' glegly up the street. He but to rin or tak a seat, The wee bit body! Bein' aye unsicker on his feet Wi' whusky toddy. To be aye tosh was Johnie's whim. There's nane was better tent than him, Though whiles his gravit-knot wad clim' Ahint his ear, An' whiles he'd buttons oot or in The less or mair. His hair a' lank aboot his bree, His tap-lip lang by inches three— A slockened sort o' mou', to pree A' sensuality— A drouthy glint was in his e'e An' personality. An' day an' nicht, frae daw to daw, Dink an' perjink an' doucely braw, Wi' a kind o' Gospel look ower a', May or October, Like Peden, followin' the Law An' no that sober. An' wow! but John was unco sport. Whiles he wad smile aboot the Court Malvolio-like—whiles snore an' snort, Was heard afar. The idle writer lads' resort Was aye John's bar. Whusky an' he were pack thegether. Whate'er the hour, whate'er the weather, John kept himsel' wi' mistened leather An' kindled spunk. Wi' him, there was nae askin' whether— John was aye drunk. The auncient heroes gash an' bauld In the uncanny days of Auld, The task ance found to which th'were called, Stack stenchly to it. His life sic noble lives recalled, Little's he knew it. Single an' straucht, he went his way. He kept the faith an' played the play. Whusky an' he were man an' may Whate'er betided. Bonny in life—in death, thir twae Were no' divided. What's merely humourous or bonny The warl' regairds wi' cauld astony. Drunk men tak' aye mair place than ony; An' sae, ye see, The gate was aye ower thrang for Johnie— Or you an' me. John micht hae jingled cap an' bells, Been a braw fule in silks an' fells. In ane o' the auld warl's canty hells, Paris or Sodom. I wadnae had him naething else But Johnie Adam. He suffered—as have a' that wan Eternal memory frae man, Sin' e'er the weary warl' began— Mister or Madam, Keats or Scots Burns, the Spanish Dan Or Johnie Adam. We leuch, an' Johnie deid. An', fegs! Hoo he had keept his stoiterin' legs Sae lang's he did, 's a fact that begs An explanation. He stachers fifty years—syne flegs To's destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNDERWOODS Of all my verse, like not a single line; But like my title, for it is not mine. That title from a better man I stole: Ah, how much better, had I stol'n the whole! BOOK I: IN ENGLISH I Envoy [Go, little book, and wish to all] Go, little book, and wish to all Flowers in the garden, meat in the hall, A bin of wine, a spice of wit, A house with lawns enclosing it, A living river by the door, A nightingale in the sycamore! II A Song of the Road The gauger walked with willing foot, And aye the gauger played the flute; And what should Master Gauger play But Over the hills and far away? When'er I buckle on my pack And foot it gaily in the track, O pleasant gauger, long since dead, I hear you fluting on ahead. You go with me the self-same way— The self-same air for me you play; For I do think and so do you It is the tune to travel to. For who would gravely set his face To go to this or t'other place? There's nothing under Heav'n so blue That's fairly worth the travelling to. On every hand the roads begin, And people walk with zeal therein; But wheresoe'er the highways tend, Be sure there's nothing at the end. Then follow you, wherever hie The travelling mountains of the sky. Or let the streams in civil mode Direct your choice upon a road; For one and all, or high or low, Will lead you where you wish to go; And one and all go night and day Over the hills and far away! III The Canoe Speaks On the great streams the ships may go About men's business to and fro. But I, the egg-shell pinnace, sleep On crystal waters ankle-deep: I, whose diminutive design, Of sweeter cedar, pithier pine, Is fashioned on so frail a mould, A hand may launch, a hand withhold: I, rather, with the leaping trout Wind, among lilies, in and out; I, the unnamed, inviolate, Green, rustic rivers, navigate; My dipping paddle scarcely shakes The berry in the bramble-brakes; Still forth on my green way I wend Beside the cottage garden-end; And by the nested angler fare, And take the lovers unaware. By willow wood and water-wheel Speedily fleets my touching keel; By all retired and shady spots Where prosper dim forget-me-nots; By meadows where at afternoon The growing maidens troop in June To loose their girdles on the grass. Ah! speedier than before the glass The backward toilet goes; and swift As swallows quiver, robe and shift And the rough country stockings lie Around each young divinity. When, following the recondite brook, Sudden upon this scene I look, And light with unfamiliar face On chaste Diana's bathing-place, Loud ring the hills about and all The shallows are abandoned. . . . IV [It is the season now to go] It is the season now to go About the country high and low, Among the lilacs hand in hand, And two by two in fairy land. The brooding boy, the sighing maid, Wholly fain and half afraid, Now meet along the hazel'd brook To pass and linger, pause and look. A year ago, and blithely paired, Their rough-and-tumble play they shared; They kissed and quarrelled, laughed and cried, A year ago at Eastertide. With bursting heart, with fiery face, She strove against him in the race; He unabashed her garter saw, That now would touch her skirts with awe. Now by the stile ablaze she stops, And his demurer eyes he drops; Now they exchange averted sighs Or stand and marry silent eyes. And he to her a hero is. And sweeter she than primroses; Their common silence dearer far Than nightingale and mavis are. Now when they sever wedded hands, Joy trembles in their bosom-strands, And lovely laughter leaps and falls Upon their lips in madrigals. V The House Beautiful A naked house, a naked moor, A shivering pool before the door, A garden bare of flowers and fruit And poplars at the garden foot: Such is the place that I live in, Bleak without and bare within. Yet shall your ragged moor receive The incomparable pomp of eve, And the cold glories of the dawn Behind your shivering trees be drawn; And when the wind from place to place Doth the unmoored cloud-galleons chase, Your garden gloom and gleam again, With leaping sun, with glancing rain. Here shall the wizard moon ascend The heavens, in the crimson end Of day's declining splendour; here The army of the stars appear. The neighbour hollows dry or wet, Spring shall with tender flowers beset; And oft the morning muser see Larks rising from the broomy lea, And every fairy wheel and thread Of cobweb dew-bediamonded. When daisies go, shall winter time Silver the simple grass with rime; Autumnal frosts enchant the pool And make the cart-ruts beautiful; And when snow-bright the moor expands, How shall your children clap their hands! To make this earth, our hermitage, A cheerful and a changeful page, God's bright and intricate device Of days and seasons doth suffice. VI A Visit from the Sea Far from the loud sea beaches Where he goes fishing and crying, Here in the inland garden Why is the sea-gull flying? Here are no fish to dive for; Here is the corn and lea; Here are the green trees rustling. Hie away home to sea! Fresh is the river water And quiet among the rushes; This is no home for the sea-gull But for the rooks and thrushes. Pity the bird that has wandered! Pity the sailor ashore! Hurry him home to the ocean, Let him come here no more! High on the sea-cliff ledges The white gulls are trooping and crying, Here among rooks and roses, Why is the sea-gull flying? VII To a Gardener Friend, in my mountain-side demesne, My plain-beholding, rosy, green And linnet-haunted garden-ground, Let still the esculents abound. Let first the onion flourish there, Rose among roots, the maiden-fair, Wine-scented and poetic soul Of the capacious salad bowl. Let thyme the mountaineer (to dress The tinier birds) and wading cress, The lover of the shallow brook, From all my plots and borders look. Nor crisp and ruddy radish, nor Pease-cods for the child's pinafore Be lacking; nor of salad clan The last and least that ever ran About great nature's garden-beds. Nor thence be missed the speary heads Of artichoke; nor thence the bean That gathered innocent and green Outsavours the belauded pea. These tend, I prithee; and for me, Thy most long-suffering master, bring In April, when the linnets sing And the days lengthen more and more At sundown to the garden door. And I, being provided thus, Shall, with superb asparagus, A book, a taper, and a cup Of country wine, divinely sup. VIII To Minnie With a hand-glass A picture-frame for you to fill, A paltry setting for your face, A thing that has no worth until You lend it something of your grace, I send (unhappy I that sing Laid by awhile upon the shelf) Because I would not send a thing Less charming than you are yourself. And happier than I, alas! (Dumb thing, I envy its delight) 'Twill wish you well, the looking-glass, And look you in the face to-night. IX To K. de M. A lover of the moorland bare And honest country winds, you were; The silver-skimming rain you took; And loved the floodings of the brook, Dew, frost and mountains, fire and seas, Tumultuary silences, Winds that in darkness fifed a tune, And the high-riding, virgin moon. And as the berry, pale and sharp, Springs on some ditch's counterscarp In our ungenial, native north— You put your frosted wildings forth, And on the heath, afar from man, A strong and bitter virgin ran. The berry ripened keeps the rude And racy flavour of the wood. And you that loved the empty plain All redolent of wind and rain, Around you still the curlew sings— The freshness of the weather clings— The maiden jewels of the rain Sit in your dabbled locks again. X To N. V. de G. S. The unfathomable sea, and time, and tears, The deeds of heroes and the crimes of kings Dispart us; and the river of events Has, for an age of years, to east and west More widely borne our cradles. Thou to me Art foreign, as when seamen at the dawn Descry a land far off and know not which. So I approach uncertain; so I cruise Round thy mysterious islet, and behold Surf and great mountains and loud river-bars, And from the shore hear inland voices call. Strange is the seaman's heart; he hopes, he fears; Draws closer and sweeps wider from that coast; Last, his rent sail refits, and to the deep His shattered prow uncomforted puts back. Yet as he goes he ponders at the helm Of that bright island; where he feared to touch, His spirit rëadventures; and for years, Where by his wife he slumbers safe at home, Thoughts of that land revisit him; he sees The eternal mountains beckon, and awakes Yearning for that far home that might have been. XI To Will H. Low Youth now flees on feathered foot, Faint and fainter sounds the flute, Rarer songs of gods; and still Somewhere on the sunny hill, Or along the winding stream, Through the willows, flits a dream; Flits but shows a smiling face, Flees but with so quaint a grace, None can choose to stay at home, All must follow, all must roam. This is unborn beauty: she Now in air floats high and free, Takes the sun and breaks the blue;— Late with stooping pinion flew Raking hedgerow trees, and wet Her wing in silver streams, and set Shining foot on temple roof: Now again she flies aloof, Coasting mountain clouds and kiss't By the evening's amethyst. In wet wood and miry lane, Still we pant and pound in vain; Still with leaden foot we chase Waning pinion, fainting face; Still with gray hair we stumble on, Till, behold, the vision gone! Where hath fleeting beauty led? To the doorway of the dead. Life is over, life was gay: We have come the primrose way. XII To Mrs Will H. Low Even in the bluest noonday of July, There could not run the smallest breath of wind But all the quarter sounded like a wood; And in the chequered silence and above The hum of city cabs that sought the Bois, Suburban ashes shivered into song. A patter and a chatter and a chirp And a long dying hiss—it was as though Starched old brocaded dames through all the house Had trailed a strident skirt, or the whole sky Even in a wink had over-brimmed in rain. Hark, in these shady parlours, how it talks Of the near Autumn, how the smitten ash Trembles and augurs floods! O not too long In these inconstant latitudes delay, O not too late from the unbeloved north Trim your escape! For soon shall this low roof Resound indeed with rain, soon shall your eyes Search the foul garden, search the darkened rooms, Nor find one jewel but the blazing log. XIII To H. F. Brown Written during a dangerous sickness I sit and wait a pair of oars On cis-Elysian river-shores. Where the immortal dead have sate, 'Tis mine to sit and meditate; To re-ascend life's rivulet, Without remorse, without regret; And sing my Alma Genetrix Among the willows of the Styx. And lo, as my serener soul Did these unhappy shores patrol, And wait with an attentive ear The coming of the gondolier, Your fire-surviving roll I took, Your spirited and happy book; Whereon, despite my frowning fate, It did my soul so recreate That all my fancies fled away On a Venetian holiday. Now, thanks to your triumphant care, Your pages clear as April air, The sails, the bells, the birds, I know, And the far-off Friulan snow; The land and sea, the sun and shade, And the blue even lamp-inlaid. For this, for these, for all, O friend, For your whole book from end to end— For Paron Piero's mutton-ham— I your defaulting debtor am. Perchance, reviving, yet may I To your sea-paven city hie, And in a felze, some day yet Light at your pipe my cigarette. XIV To Andrew Lang Dear Andrew, with the brindled hair, Who glory to have thrown in air, High over arm, the trembling reed, By Ale and Kail, by Till and Tweed: An equal craft of hand you show The pen to guide, the fly to throw: I count you happy starred; for God, When He with inkpot and with rod Endowed you, bade your fortune lead Forever by the crooks of Tweed, Forever by the woods of song And lands that to the Muse belong; Or if in peopled streets, or in The abhorred pedantic sanhedrin, It should be yours to wander, still Airs of the morn, airs of the hill, The plovery Forest and the seas That break about the Hebrides, Should follow over field and plain And find you at the window pane; And you again see hill and peel, And the bright springs gush at your heel. So went the fiat forth, and so Garrulous like a brook you go, With sound of happy mirth and sheen Of daylight—whether by the green You fare that moment, or the gray; Whether you dwell in March or May; Or whether treat of reels and rods Or of the old unhappy gods: Still like a brook your page has shone, And your ink sings of Helicon. XV Et Tu in Arcadia Vixisti To R. A. M. S. In ancient tales, O friend, thy spirit dwelt; There, from of old, thy childhood passed; and there High expectation, high delights and deeds, Thy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved. And thou hast heard of yore the Blatant Beast, And Roland's horn, and that war-scattering shout Of all-unarmed Achilles, ægis-crowned. And perilous lands thou sawest, sounding shores And seas and forests drear, island and dale And mountain dark. For thou with Tristram rod'st Or Bedevere, in farthest Lyonesse. Thou hadst a booth in Samarcand, whereat Side-looking Magians trafficked; thence, by night, An Afreet snatched thee, and with wings upbore Beyond the Aral mount; or, hoping gain, Thou, with a jar of money, didst embark, For Balsorah, by sea. But chiefly thou In that clear air took'st life; in Arcady The haunted, land of song; and by the wells Where most the gods frequent. There Chiron old, In the Pelethronian antre, taught thee lore: The plants, he taught, and by the shining stars In forests dim to steer. There hast thou seen Immortal Pan dance secret in a glade, And, dancing, roll his eyes; these, where they fell, Shed glee, and through the congregated oaks A flying horror winged; while all the earth To the god's pregnant footing thrilled within. Or whiles, beside the sobbing stream, he breathed, In his clutched pipe, unformed and wizard strains. Divine yet brutal; which the forest heard, And thou, with awe; and far upon the plain The unthinking ploughman started and gave ear. Now things there are that, upon him who sees, A strong vocation lay; and strains there are That whoso hears shall hear for evermore. For evermore thou hear'st immortal Pan And those melodious godheads, ever young And ever quiring, on the mountains old. What was this earth, child of the gods, to thee? Forth from thy dreamland thou, a dreamer, cam'st, And in thine ears the olden music rang, And in thy mind the doings of the dead, And those heroic ages long forgot. To a so fallen earth, alas! too late, Alas! in evil days, thy steps return, To list at noon for nightingales, to grow A dweller on the beach till Argo come That came long since, a lingerer by the pool Where that desirèd angel bathes no more. As when the Indian to Dakota comes, Or farthest Idaho, and where he dwelt, He with his clan, a humming city finds; Thereon awhile, amazed, he stares, and then To right and leftward, like a questing dog, Seeks first the ancestral altars, then the hearth Long cold with rains, and where old terror lodged, And where the dead. So thee undying Hope, With all her pack, hunts screaming through the years: Here, there, thou fleeëst; but nor here nor there The pleasant gods abide, the glory dwells. That, that was not Apollo, not the god. This was not Venus, though she Venus seemed A moment. And though fair yon river move, She, all the way, from disenchanted fount To seas unhallowed runs; the gods forsook Long since her trembling rushes; from her plains Disconsolate, long since adventure fled; And now although the inviting river flows, And every poplared cape, and every bend Or willowy islet, win upon thy soul And to thy hopeful shallop whisper speed; Yet hope not thou at all; hope is no more; And O, long since the golden groves are dead The faery cities vanished from the land! XVI To W. E. Henley The year runs through her phases; rain and sun, Springtime and summer pass; winter succeeds; But one pale season rules the house of death. Cold falls the imprisoned daylight; fell disease By each lean pallet squats, and pain and sleep Toss gaping on the pillows. But O thou! Uprise and take thy pipe. Bid music flow, Strains by good thoughts attended, like the spring The swallows follow over land and sea. Pain sleeps at once; at once, with open eyes, Dozing despair awakes. The shepherd sees His flock come bleating home; the seaman hears Once more the cordage rattle. Airs of home! Youth, love and roses blossom; the gaunt ward Dislimns and disappears, and, opening out, Shows brooks and forests, and the blue beyond Of mountains. Small the pipe; but O! do thou, Peak-faced and suffering piper, blow therein The dirge of heroes dead; and to these sick, These dying, sound the triumph over death. Behold! each greatly breathes; each tastes a joy Unknown before, in dying; for each knows A hero dies with him—though unfulfilled, Yet conquering truly—and not dies in vain. So is pain cheered, death comforted; the house Of sorrow smiles to listen. Once again— O thou, Orpheus and Heracles, the bard And the deliverer, touch the stops again! XVII Henry James Who comes to-night? We ope the doors in vain. Who comes? My bursting walls, can you contain The presences that now together throng Your narrow entry, as with flowers and song, As with the air of life, the breath of talk? Lo, how these fair immaculate women walk Behind their jocund maker; and we see Slighted De Mauves, and that far different she, Gressie, the trivial sphynx; and to our feast Daisy and Barb and Chancellor (she not least!) With all their silken, all their airy kin, Do like unbidden angels enter in. But he, attended by these shining names, Comes (best of all) himself—our welcome James. XVIII The Mirror Speaks Where the bells peal far at sea Cunning fingers fashioned me. There on palace walls I hung While that Consuelo sung; But I heard, though I listened well, Never a note, never a trill, Never a beat of the chiming bell. There I hung and looked, and there In my gray face, faces fair Shone from under shining hair. Well I saw the poising head, But the lips moved and nothing said; And when lights were in the hall, Silent moved the dancers all. So awhile I glowed, and then Fell on dusty days and men; Long I slumbered packed in straw, Long I none but dealers saw; Till before my silent eye One that sees came passing by. Now with an outlandish grace, To the sparkling fire I face In the blue room at Skerryvore; Where I wait until the door Open, and the Prince of Men, Henry James, shall come again. XIX Katharine We see you as we see a face That trembles in a forest place Upon the mirror of a pool Forever quiet, clear and cool; And in the wayward glass, appears To hover between smiles and tears, Elfin and human, airy and true, And backed by the reflected blue. XX To F. J. S. I read, dear friend, in your dear face Your life's tale told with perfect grace; The river of your life, I trace Up the sun-chequered, devious bed To the far-distant fountain-head. Not one quick beat of your warm heart, Nor thought that came to you apart, Pleasure nor pity, love nor pain Nor sorrow, has gone by in vain; But as some lone, wood-wandering child Brings home with him at evening mild The thorns and flowers of all the wild, From your whole life, O fair and true Your flowers and thorns you bring with you! XXI Requiem Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will. This be the verse you grave for me: Here he lies where he longed to be; Home is the sailor, home from sea, And the hunter home from the hill. XXII The Celestial Surgeon If I have faltered more or less In my great task of happiness; If I have moved among my race And shown no glorious morning face; If beams from happy human eyes Have moved me not; if morning skies, Books, and my food, and summer rain Knocked on my sullen heart in vain: Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take And stab my spirit broad awake; Or, Lord, if too obdurate I, Choose thou, before that spirit die, A piercing pain, a killing sin, And to my dead heart run them in! XXIII Our Lady of the Snows Out of the sun, out of the blast, Out of the world, alone I passed Across the moor and through the wood To where the monastery stood. There neither lute nor breathing fife, Nor rumour of the world of life, Nor confidences low and dear, Shall strike the meditative ear. Aloof, unhelpful, and unkind, The prisoners of the iron mind, Where nothing speaks except the bell The unfraternal brothers dwell. Poor passionate men, still clothed afresh With agonising folds of flesh; Whom the clear eyes solicit still To some bold output of the will, While fairy Fancy far before And musing Memory-Hold-the-door Now to heroic death invite And now uncurtain fresh delight: O, little boots it thus to dwell On the remote unneighboured hill! O to be up and doing, O Unfearing and unshamed to go In all the uproar and the press About my human business! My undissuaded heart I hear Whisper courage in my ear. With voiceless calls, the ancient earth Summons me to a daily birth. Thou, O my love, ye, O my friends— The gist of life, the end of ends— To laugh, to love, to live, to die, Ye call me by the ear and eye! Forth from the casemate, on the plain Where honour has the world to gain, Pour forth and bravely do your part, O knights of the unshielded heart! Forth and forever forward!—out From prudent turret and redoubt, And in the mellay charge amain, To fall but yet to rise again! Captive? ah, still, to honour bright, A captive soldier of the right! Or free and fighting, good with ill? Unconquering but unconquered still! And ye, O brethren, what if God, When from Heav'n's top he spies abroad, And sees on this tormented stage The noble war of mankind rage: What if his vivifying eye, O monks, should pass your corner by? For still the Lord is Lord of might; In deeds, in deeds, he takes delight; The plough, the spear, the laden barks, The field, the founded city, marks; He marks the smiler of the streets, The singer upon garden seats; He sees the climber in the rocks: To him, the shepherd folds his flocks. For those he loves that underprop With daily virtues Heaven's top, And bear the falling sky with ease, Unfrowning caryatides. Those he approves that ply the trade, That rock the child, that wed the maid, That with weak virtues, weaker hands, Sow gladness on the peopled lands, And still with laughter, song and shout, Spin the great wheel of earth about. But ye?—O ye who linger still Here in your fortress on the hill, With placid face, with tranquil breath, The unsought volunteers of death, Our cheerful General on high With careless looks may pass you by. XXIV [Not yet, my soul, these friendly fields desert] Not yet, my soul, these friendly fields desert, Where thou with grass, and rivers, and the breeze, And the bright face of day, thy dalliance hadst; Where to thine ear first sang the enraptured birds; Where love and thou that lasting bargain made. The ship rides trimmed, and from the eternal shore Thou hearest airy voices; but not yet Depart, my soul, not yet awhile depart. Freedom is far, rest far. Thou art with life Too closely woven, nerve with nerve intwined; Service still craving service, love for love, Love for dear love, still suppliant with tears. Alas, not yet thy human task is done! A bond at birth is forged; a debt doth lie Immortal on mortality. It grows— By vast rebound it grows, unceasing growth; Gift upon gift, alms upon alms, upreared, From man, from God, from nature, till the soul At that so huge indulgence stands amazed. Leave not, my soul, the unfoughten field, nor leave Thy debts dishonoured, nor thy place desert Without due service rendered. For thy life, Up, spirit, and defend that fort of clay, Thy body, now beleaguered; whether soon Or late she fall; whether today thy friends Bewail thee dead, or, after years, a man Grown old in honour and the friend of peace. Contend, my soul, for moments and for hours; Each is with service pregnant; each reclaimed Is as a kingdom conquered, where to reign. As when a captain rallies to the fight His scattered legions, and beats ruin back, He, on the field, encamps, well pleased in mind. Yet surely him shall fortune overtake, Him smite in turn, headlong his ensigns drive; And that dear land, now safe, to-morrow fall. But he, unthinking, in the present good Solely delights, and all the camps rejoice. XXV [It is not yours, O mother, to complain] It is not yours, O mother, to complain, Not, mother, yours to weep, Though nevermore your son again Shall to your bosom creep, Though nevermore again you watch your baby sleep. Though in the greener paths of earth, Mother and child, no more We wander; and no more the birth Of me whom once you bore, Seems still the brave reward that once it seemed of yore; Though as all passes, day and night, The seasons and the years, From you, O mother, this delight, This also disappears— Some profit yet survives of all your pangs and tears. The child, the seed, the grain of corn, The acorn on the hill, Each for some separate end is born In season fit, and still Each must in strength arise to work the almighty will. So from the hearth the children flee, By that almighty hand Austerely led; so one by sea Goes forth, and one by land; Nor aught of all man's sons escapes from that command. So from the sally each obeys The unseen almighty nod; So till the ending all their ways Blindfolded loth have trod: Nor knew their task at all, but were the tools of God. And as the fervent smith of yore Beat out the glowing blade, Nor wielded in the front of war The weapons that he made, But in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade; So like a sword the son shall roam On nobler missions sent; And as the smith remained at home In peaceful turret pent, So sits the while at home the mother well content. XXVI The Sick Child Child. O mother, lay your hand on my brow! O mother, mother, where am I now? Why is the room so gaunt and great? Why am I lying awake so late? Mother. Fear not at all: the night is still. Nothing is here that means you ill— Nothing but lamps the whole town through, And never a child awake but you. Child. Mother, mother, speak low in my ear, Some of the things are so great and near, Some are so small and far away, I have a fear that I cannot say. What have I done, and what do I fear, And why are you crying, mother dear? Mother. Out in the city, sounds begin. Thank the kind God, the carts come in! An hour or two more, and God is so kind, The day shall be blue in the window-blind, Then shall my child go sweetly asleep, And dream of the birds and the hills of sheep. XXVII In Memoriam F. A. S. Yet, O stricken heart, remember, O remember How of human days he lived the better part. April came to bloom and never dim December Breathed its killing chills upon the head or heart. Doomed to know not Winter, only Spring, a being Trod the flowery April blithely for a while, Took his fill of music, joy of thought and seeing, Came and stayed and went, nor ever ceased to smile. Came and stayed and went, and now when all is finished, You alone have crossed the melancholy stream, Yours the pang, but his, O his, the undiminished Undecaying gladness, undeparted dream. All that life contains of torture, toil, and treason, Shame, dishonour, death, to him were but a name. Here, a boy, he dwelt through all the singing season And ere the day of sorrow departed as he came. XXVIII To My Father Peace and her huge invasion to these shores Puts daily home; innumerable sails Dawn on the far horizon and draw near; Innumerable loves, uncounted hopes To our wild coasts, not darkling now, approach: Not now obscure, since thou and thine are there, And bright on the lone isle, the foundered reef, The long, resounding foreland, Pharos stands. These are thy works, O father, these thy crown; Whether on high the air be pure, they shine Along the yellowing sunset, and all night Among the unnumbered stars of God they shine; Or whether fogs arise and far and wide The low sea-level drown—each finds a tongue And all night long the tolling bell resounds: So shine, so toll, till night be overpast, Till the stars vanish, till the sun return, And in the haven rides the fleet secure. In the first hour, the seaman in his skiff Moves through the unmoving bay, to where the town Its earliest smoke into the air upbreathes And the rough hazels climb along the beach. To the tugg'd oar the distant echo speaks. The ship lies resting, where by reef and roost Thou and thy lights have led her like a child. This hast thou done, and I—can I be base? I must arise, O father, and to port Some lost, complaining seaman pilot home. XXIX In the States With half a heart I wander here As from an age gone by A brother—yet though young in years, An elder brother, I. You speak another tongue than mine, Though both were English born. I towards the night of time decline, You mount into the morn. Youth shall grow great and strong and free, But age must still decay: To-morrow for the States—for me, England and Yesterday. XXX A Portrait I am a kind of farthing dip, Unfriendly to the nose and eyes; A blue-behinded ape, I skip Upon the trees of Paradise. At mankind's feast, I take my place In solemn, sanctimonious state, And have the air of saying grace While I defile the dinner plate. I am ‘the smiler with the knife,’ The battener upon garbage, I— Dear Heaven, with such a rancid life, Were it not better far to die? Yet still, about the human pale, I love to scamper, love to race, To swing by my irreverent tail All over the most holy place; And when at length, some golden day, The unfailing sportsman, aiming at, Shall bag, me—all the world shall say: Thank God, and there's an end of that! XXXI [Sing clearlier, Muse, or evermore be still] Sing clearlier, Muse, or evermore be still, Sing truer or no longer sing! No more the voice of melancholy Jacques To wake a weeping echo in the hill; But as the boy, the pirate of the spring, From the green elm a living linnet takes, One natural verse recapture—then be still. XXXII A Camp The bed was made, the room was fit, By punctual eve the stars were lit; The air was still, the water ran, No need was there for maid or man, When we put up, my ass and I, At God's green caravanserai. XXXIII The Country of the Camisards We travelled in the print of olden wars, Yet all the land was green, And love we found, and peace, Where fire and war had been. They pass and smile, the children of the sword— No more the sword they wield; And O, how deep the corn Along the battlefield! XXXIV Skerryvore For love of lovely words, and for the sake Of those, my kinsmen and my countrymen, Who early and late in the windy ocean toiled To plant a star for seamen, where was then The surfy haunt of seals and cormorants: I, on the lintel of this cot, inscribe The name of a strong tower. XXXV Skerryvore: The Parallel Here all is sunny, and when the truant gull Skims the green level of the lawn, his wing Dispetals roses; here the house is framed Of kneaded brick and the plumed mountain pine, Such clay as artists fashion and such wood As the tree-climbing urchin breaks. But there Eternal granite hewn from the living isle And dowelled with brute iron, rears a tower That from its wet foundation to its crown Of glittering glass, stands, in the sweep of winds, Immovable, immortal, eminent. XXXVI [My house, I say. But hark to the sunny doves] My house, I say. But hark to the sunny doves That make my roof the arena of their loves, That gyre about the gable all day long And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song: Our house, they say; and mine, the cat declares And spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs; And mine the dog, and rises stiff with wrath If any alien foot profane the path. So too the buck that trimmed my terraces, Our whilome gardener, called the garden his; Who now, deposed, surveys my plain abode And his late kingdom, only from the road. XXXVII [My body which my dungeon is] My body which my dungeon is, And yet my parks and palaces: Which is so great that there I go All the day long to and fro, And when the night begins to fall Throw down my bed and sleep, while all The building hums with wakefulness— Even as a child of savages When evening takes her on her way, (She having roamed a summer's day Along the mountain-sides and scalp) Sleeps in an antre of that alp: Which is so broad and high that there, As in the topless fields of air, My fancy soars like to a kite And faints in the blue infinite: Which is so strong, my strongest throes And the rough world's besieging blows Not break it, and so weak withal, Death ebbs and flows in its loose wall As the green sea in fishers' nets, And tops its topmost parapets: Which is so wholly mine that I Can wield its whole artillery, And mine so little, that my soul Dwells in perpetual control, And I but think and speak and do As my dead fathers move me to: If this born body of my bones The beggared soul so barely owns, What money passed from hand to hand, What creeping custom of the land, What deed of author or assign, Can make a house a thing of mine? XXXVIII [Say not of me that weakly I declined] Say not of me that weakly I declined The labours of my sires, and fled the sea, The towers we founded and the lamps we lit, To play at home with paper like a child. But rather say: In the afternoon of time A strenuous family dusted from its hands The sand of granite, and beholding far Along the sounding coast its pyramids And tall memorials catch the dying sun, Smiled well content, and to this childish task Around the fire addressed its evening hours. BOOK II: IN SCOTS I The Maker to Posterity Far 'yont amang the years to be When a' we think, an' a' we see, An' a' we luve, 's been dung ajee By time's rouch shouther, An' what was richt and wrang for me Lies mangled throu'ther, It's possible—it's hardly mair— That some ane, ripin' after lear— Some auld professor or young heir, If still there's either— May find an' read me, an' be sair Perplexed, puir brither! ‘What tongue does your auld bookie speak?’ He'll spier; an' I, his mou to steik: ‘No bein' fit to write in Greek, I wrote in Lallan, Dear to my heart as the peat reek, Auld as Tantallon. ‘Few spak it than, an' noo there's nane. My puir auld sangs lie a' their lane, Their sense, that aince was braw an' plain, Tint a'thegether, Like runes upon a standin' stane Amang the heather. ‘But think not you the brae to speel; You, tae, maun chow the bitter peel; For a' your lear, for a' your skeel, Ye're nane sae lucky; An' things are mebbe waur than weel For you, my buckie. ‘The hale concern (baith hens an' eggs, Baith books an' writers, stars an' clegs) Noo stachers upon lowsent legs An' wears awa'; The tack o' mankind, near the dregs, Rins unco' law. ‘Your book, that in some braw new tongue, Ye wrote or prentit, preached or sung, Will still be just a bairn, an' young In fame an' years, Whan the hale planet's guts are dung About your ears; ‘An' you, sair gruppin' to a spar Or whammled wi' some bleezin' star, Cryin' to ken whaur deil ye are, Hame, France, or Flanders— Whang sindry like a railway car An' flie in danders.’ II Ille Terrarum Frae nirly, nippin', Eas'lan' breeze, Frae Norlan' snaw, an' haar o' seas, Weel happit in your gairden trees, A bonny bit, Atween the muckle Pentland's knees, Secure ye sit. Beeches an' aiks entwine their theek, An' firs, a stench, auld-farrant clique. A' simmer day, your chimleys reek, Couthy and bien; An' here an' there your windies keek Amang the green. A pickle plats an' paths an' posies, A wheen auld gillyflowers an' roses: A ring o' wa's the hale encloses Frae sheep or men; An' there the auld housie beeks an' dozes, A' by her lane. The gairdner crooks his weary back A' day in the pitaty-track, Or mebbe stops awhile to crack Wi' Jane the cook, Or at some buss, worm-eaten-black, To gie a look. Frae the high hills the curlew ca's; The sheep gang baaing by the wa's; Or whiles a clan o' roosty craws Cangle thegether; The wild bees seek the gairden raws, Weariet wi' heather. Or in the gloamin' douce an' gray The sweet-throat mavis tunes her lay; The herd comes linkin' doun the brae; An' by degrees The muckle siller müne maks way Amang the trees. Here aft hae I, wi' sober heart, For meditation sat apairt, When orra loves or kittle art Perplexed my mind; Here socht a balm for ilka smart O' humankind. Here aft, weel neukit by my lane, Wi' Horace, or perhaps Montaigne, The mornin' hours hae come an' gane Abüne my heid— I wadnae gi'en a chucky-stane For a' I'd read. But noo the auld city, street by street, An' winter fu' o' snaw an' sleet, Awhile shut in my gangrel feet An' goavin' mettle; Noo is the soopit ingle sweet, An' liltin' kettle. An' noo the winter winds complain; Cauld lies the glaur in ilka lane; On draigled hizzie, tautit wean An' drucken lads, In the mirk nicht, the winter rain Dribbles an' blads. Whan bugles frae the Castle rock, An' beaten drums wi' dowie shock, Wauken, at cauld-rife sax o'clock, My chitterin' frame, I mind me on the kintry cock, The kintry hame. I mind me on yon bonny bield; An' Fancy traivels far afield To gaither a' that gairdens yield O' sun an' Simmer: To hearten up a dowie chield, Fancy's the limmer! III [When aince Aprile has fairly come] When aince Aprile has fairly come, An' birds may bigg in winter's lum, An' pleisure's spreid for a' and some O' whatna state, Love, wi' her auld recruitin' drum, Than taks the gate. The heart plays dunt wi' main an' micht; The lasses' een are a' sae bricht, Their dresses are sae braw an' ticht, The bonny birdies!— Puir winter virtue at the sicht Gangs heels ower hurdies. An' aye as love frae land to land Tirls the drum wi' eident hand, A' men collect at her command, Toun-bred or land'art, An' follow in a denty band Her gaucy standart. An' I, wha sang o' rain an' snaw, An' weary winter weel awa', Noo busk me in a jacket braw, An' tak my place I' the ram-stam, harum-scarum raw, Wi' smilin' face. IV A Mile an' a Bittock A mile an' a bittock, a mile or twa, Abüne the burn, ayont the law, Davie an' Donal' an' Cherlie an' a', An' the müne was shinin' clearly! Ane went hame wi' the ither, an' then The ither went hame wi' the ither twa men, An' baith wad return him the service again, An' the müne was shinin' clearly! The clocks were chappin' in house an' ha', Eleeven, twal an' ane an' twa; An' the guidman's face was turnt to the wa', An' the müne was shinin' clearly! A wind got up frae affa the sea, It blew the stars as clear's could be, It blew in the een of a' o' the three, An' the müne was shinin' clearly! Noo, Davie was first to get sleep in his head, ‘The best o' frien's maun twine,’ he said; ‘I'm weariet, an' here I'm awa' to my bed.’ An' the müne was shinin' clearly! Twa o' them walkin' an' crackin' their lane, The mornin' licht cam gray an' plain, An' the birds they yammert on stick an' stane, An' the müne was shinin' clearly! O years ayont, O years awa', My lads, ye'll mind whate'er befa'— My lads, ye'll mind on the bield o' the law, When the müne was shinin' clearly. V A Lowden Sabbath Morn The clinkum-clank o' Sabbath bells Noo to the hoastin' rookery swells, Noo faintin' laigh in shady dells, Sounds far an' near, An' through the simmer kintry tells Its tale o' cheer. An' noo, to that melodious play, A' deidly awn the quiet sway— A' ken their solemn holiday, Bestial an' human, The singin' lintie on the brae, The restin' plou'man. He, mair than a' the lave o' men, His week completit joys to ken; Half-dressed, he daunders out an' in, Perplext wi' leisure; An' his raxt limbs he'll rax again Wi' painfü' pleesure. The steerin' mither strange afit Noo shoos the bairnies but a bit; Noo cries them ben, their Sinday shüit To scart upon them, Or sweeties in their pouch to pit, Wi' blessin's on them. The lasses, clean frae tap to taes, Are busked in crunklin' underclaes; The gartened hose, the weel-filled stays, The nakit shift, A' bleached on bonny greens for days, An' white's the drift. An' noo to face the kirkward mile: The guidman's hat o' dacent style, The blackit shoon, we noo maun fyle As white's the miller: A waefü' peety tae, to spile The warth o' siller. Our Marg'et, aye sae keen to crack, Douce-stappin' in the stoury track, Her emeralt goun a' kiltit back Frae snawy coats, White-ankled, leads the kirkward pack Wi' Dauvit Groats. A thocht ahint, in runkled breeks, A' spiled wi' lyin' by for weeks, The guidman follows closs, an' cleiks The sonsie missis; His sarious face at aince bespeaks The day that this is. And aye an' while we nearer draw To whaur the kirkton lies alaw, Mair neebours, comin' saft an' slaw Frae here an' there, The thicker thrang the gate an' caw The stour in air. But hark! the bells frae nearer clang; To rowst the slaw, their sides they bang; An' see! black coats a'ready thrang The green kirkyaird; And at the yett, the chestnuts spang That brocht the laird. The solemn elders at the plate Stand drinkin' deep the pride o' state: The practised hands as gash an' great As Lords o' Session; The later named, a wee thing blate In their expression. The prentit stanes that mark the deid, Wi' lengthened lip, the sarious read; Syne wag a moraleesin' heid, An' then an' there Their hirplin' practice an' their creed Try hard to square. It's here our Merren lang has lain, A wee bewast the table-stane; An' yon's the grave o' Sandy Blane; An' further ower, The mither's brithers, dacent men! Lie a' the fower. Here the guidman sall bide awee To dwall amang the deid; to see Auld faces clear in fancy's e'e; Belike to hear Auld voices fa'in saft an' slee On fancy's ear. Thus, on the day o' solemn things, The bell that in the steeple swings To fauld a scaittered faim'ly rings Its walcome screed; An' just a wee thing nearer brings The quick an' deid. But noo the bell is ringin' in; To tak their places, folk begin; The minister himsel' will shüne Be up the gate, Filled fu' wi' clavers about sin An' man's estate. The tünes are up—French, to be shüre, The faithfü' French, an' twa-three mair; The auld prezentor, hoastin' sair, Wales out the portions, An' yirks the tüne into the air Wi' queer contortions. Follows the prayer, the readin' next, An' than the fisslin' for the text— The twa-three last to find it, vext But kind o' proud; An' than the peppermints are raxed, An' southernwood. For noo's the time whan pows are seen Nid noddin' like a mandareen; When tenty mithers stap a preen In sleepin' weans; An' nearly half the parochine Forget their pains. There's just a waukrif' twa or three: Thrawn commentautors sweet to 'gree, Weans glowrin' at the bumlin' bee On windie-glasses, Or lads that tak a keek a-glee At sonsie lasses. Himsel', meanwhile, frae whaur he cocks An' bobs belaw the soundin'-box, The treesures of his words unlocks Wi' prodigality, An' deals some unco dingin' knocks To infidality. Wi' sappy unction, hoo he burkes The hopes o' men that trust in works, Expounds the fau'ts o' ither kirks, An' shaws the best o' them No muckle better than mere Turks, When a's confessed o' them. Bethankit! what a bonny creed! What mair would ony Christian need?— The braw words rumm'le ower his heid, Nor steer the sleeper; And in their restin' graves, the deid Sleep aye the deeper. VI The Spaewife O, I wad like to ken—to the beggar-wife says I— Why chops are guid to brander and nane sae guid to fry. An' siller, that's sae braw to keep, is brawer still to gi'e. —It's gey an' easy spierin', says the beggar-wife to me. O, I wad like to ken—to the beggar-wife says I— Hoo a' things come to be whaur we find them when we try, The lasses in their claes an' the fishes in the sea. —It's gey an' easy spierin', says the beggar-wife to me. O, I wad like to ken—to the beggar-wife says I— Why lads are a' to sell an' lasses a' to buy; An' naebody for dacency but barely twa or three. —It's gey an' easy spierin', says the beggar-wife to me. O, I wad like to ken—to the beggar-wife says I— Gin death's as shüre to men as killin' is to kye, Why God has filled the yearth sae fu' o' tasty things to pree. —It's gey an' easy spierin', says the beggar-wife to me. O, I wad like to ken—to the beggar wife says I— The reason o' the cause an' the wherefore o' the why, Wi' mony anither riddle brings the tears into my e'e. —It's gey an' easy spierin', says the beggar-wife to me. VII The Blast—1875 It's rainin'. Weet's the gairden sod, Weet the lang roads whaur gangrels plod A maist unceevil thing o' God In mid July— If ye'll just curse the sneckdraw, dod! An' sae wull I! He's a braw place in Heev'n, ye ken, An' lea's us puir, forjaskit men Clamjamfried in the but and ben He ca's the earth— A wee bit inconvenient den No muckle worth; An' whiles, at orra times, keeks out, Sees what puir mankind are about; An' if He can, I've little doubt, Upsets their plans; He hates a' mankind, brainch and root, An' a' that's man's. An' whiles, whan they tak heart again, An' life i' the sun looks braw an' plain, Doun comes a jaw o' droukin' rain Upon their honours— God sends a spate outower the plain, Or mebbe thun'ers. Lord safe us, life's an unco thing! Simmer an' Winter, Yule an' Spring, The damned, dour-heartit seasons bring A feck o' trouble. I wadnae try't to be a king— No, nor for double. But since we're in it, willy-nilly, We maun be watchfü,' wise an' skilly, An' no mind ony ither billy, Lassie nor God. But drink—that's my best counsel till 'e: Sae tak the nod. VIII The Counterblast—1886 My bonny man, the warld, it's true, Was made for neither me nor you; It's just a place to warstle through, As Job confessed o't; And aye the best that we'll can do Is mak the best o't. There's rowth o' wrang, I'm free to say; The simmer brunt, the winter blae, The face of earth a' fyled wi' clay An' dour wi' chuckies, An' life a rough an' land'art play For country buckies. An' food's anither name for clart; An' beasts an' brambles bite an' scart; An' what would we be like, my heart! If bared o' claethin'? —A weel, I cannae mend your cart: It's that or naethin'. A feck o' folk frae first to last Have through this queer experience passed; Twa-three, I ken, just damn an' blast The hale transaction; But twa-three ithers, east an' wast, Fand satisfaction. Whaur braid the briery muirs expand, A waefü' an' a weary land, A bumblebees, a gowden band, Are blithely hingin'; An' there the canty wanderer fand The laverock singin'. Trout in the burn grow great as herr'n'; The simple sheep can find their fair'n'; The wind blaws clean about the cairn Wi' caller air; The muircock an' the barefit bairn Are happy there. Sic-like the howes o' life to some: Green loans whaur they ne'er fash their thumb, But mark the muckle winds that come, Soopin' an' cool, Or hear the powrin' burnie drum In the shilfa's pool. The evil wi' the guid they tak; They ca' a gray thing gray, no black; To a steigh brae, a stubborn back Addressin' daily; An' up the rude, unbieldy track O' life, gang gaily. What you would like's a palace ha', Or Sinday parlour dink an' braw Wi' a' things ordered in a raw By denty leddies. Weel, then, ye cannae hae't: that's a' That to be said is. An' since at life ye've taen the grue, An' winnae blithely hirsle through, Ye've fund the very thing to do— That's to drink speerit; An' shüne we'll hear the last o' you— An' blithe to hear it! The shoon ye coft, the life ye lead, Ithers will heir when aince ye're deid; They'll heir your tasteless bite o' breid, An' find it sappy; They'll to your dulefü' house succeed, An' there be happy. As whan a glum an' fractious wean Has sat an' sullened by his lane Till, wi' a rowstin' skelp, he's taen An' shoo'd to bed— The ither bairns a' fa' to play'n', As gleg's a gled. IX The Counterblast Ironical It's strange that God should fash to frame The yearth and lift sae hie, An' clean forget to explain the same To a gentleman like me. They gutsy, donnered ither folk, Their weird they weel may dree; But why present a pig in a poke To a gentleman like me? They ither folk their parritch eat An' sup their sugared tea; But the mind is no to be wyled wi' meat Wi' a gentleman like me. They ither folk, they court their joes At gloamin' on the lea; But they're made of a commoner clay, I suppose, Than a gentleman like me. They ither folk, for richt or wrang, They suffer, bleed, or dee; But a' thir things are an emp'y sang To a gentleman like me. It's a different thing that I demand, Tho' humble as can be— A statement fair in my Maker's hand To a gentleman like me: A clear account writ fair an' broad, An' a plain apologie; Or the deevil a ceevil word to God From a gentleman like me. X Their Laureate to an Academy Class Dinner Club Dear Thamson class, whaure'er I gang It aye comes ower me wi' a spang: ‘Lordsake! they Thamson lads—(deil hang Or else Lord mend them!)— An' that wanchancy annual sang I ne'er can send them!’ Straucht, at the name a trusty tyke, My conscience girrs ahint the dyke; Straucht on my hinderlands I fyke To find a rhyme t'ye; Pleased—although mebbe no pleased-like— To gie my time t'ye. ‘Weel,’ an' says you, wi' heavin' breist, ‘Sae far, sae guid, but what's the neist? Yearly we gaither to the feast, A' hopefü' men— Yearly we skelloch “Hang the beast— Nae sang again!”’ My lads, an' what am I to say? Ye shüurely ken the Muse's way: Yestreen, as gleg's a tyke—the day, Thrawn like a cuddy: Her conduc', that to her's a play, Deith to a body. Aft whan I sat an' made my mane, Aft whan I laboured burd-alane Fishin' for rhymes an' findin' nane, Or nane were fit for ye— Ye judged me cauld's a chucky stane— No car'n' a bit for ye! But saw ye ne'er some pingein' bairn As weak as a pitaty-par'n'— Less üsed wi' guidin' horse-shoe airn Than steerin' crowdie— Packed aff his lane, by moss an' cairn, To ca' the howdie. Wae's me, for the puir callant than! He wambles like a poke o' bran, An' the lowse rein, as hard's he can, Pu's, trem'lin' handit; Till, blaff! upon his hinderlan' Behauld him landit. Sic-like—I awn the weary fac'— Whan on my Muse the gate I tak, An' see her gleed e'e raxin' back To keek ahint her;— To me, the brig o' Heev'n gangs black As blackest winter. ‘Lordsake! we're aff,’ thinks I, ‘but whaur? On what abhorred an' whinny scaur, Or whammled in what sea o' glaur, Will she desert me? An' will she just disgrace? or waur— Will she no hurt me?’ Kittle the quaere! But at least The day I've backed the fashious beast, While she, wi' mony a spang an' reist, Flang heels ower bonnet; An' a' triumphant—for your feast, Hae! there's your sonnet! XI Embro Hie Kirk The Lord Himsel' in former days Waled out the proper tünes for praise An' named the proper kind o' claes For folk to preach in: Preceese and in the chief o' ways Important teachin'. He ordered a' things late and air'; He ordered folk to stand at prayer. (Although I cannae just mind where He gave the warnin'.) An' pit pomatum on their hair On Sabbath mornin'. The hale o' life by His commands Was ordered to a body's hands; But see! this corpus juris stands By a' forgotten; An' God's religion in a' lands Is deid an' rotten. While thus the lave o' mankind's lost, O' Scotland still God maks His boast— Puir Scotland, on whase barren coast A score or twa Auld wives wi' mutches an' a hoast Still keep His law. In Scotland, a wheen canty, plain, Douce, kintry-leevin' folk retain The Truth—or did so aince—alane Of a' men leevin'; An' noo just twa o' them remain— Just Begg an' Niven. For noo, unfaithfü', to the Lord Auld Scotland joins the rebel horde; Her human hymn-books on the board She noo displays: An' Embro Hie kirk's been restored In popish ways. O punctum temporis for action To a' o' the reformin' faction, If yet, by ony act or paction, Thocht, word, or sermon, This dark an' damnable transaction Micht yet determine! For see—as Doctor Begg explains— Hoo easy 't's düne! a pickle weans, Wha in the Hie Street gaither stanes By his instruction, The uncovenantit, pentit panes Ding to destruction. Up, Niven, or ower late—an' dash Laigh in the glaur that carnal hash; Let spires and pews wi' gran' stramash Thegether fa'; The rumlin' kist o' whustles smash In pieces sma'. Noo choose ye out a walie hammer; About the knottit buttress clam'er; Alang the steep roof stoyt an' stammer, A gate mis-chancy; On the aul' spire, the bells' hie cha'mer, Dance your bit dancie. Ding, devel, dunt, destroy, an' ruin, Wi' carnal stanes the square bestrewin', Till your loud chaps frae Kyle to Fruin, Frae Hell to Heeven, Tell the guid wark that baith are doin'— Baith Begg an' Niven. XII The Scotsman's Return from Abroad In a letter from Mr Thomson to Mr Johnstone In mony a foreign pairt I've been, An' mony an unco ferlie seen, Since, Mr Johnstone, you and I Last walkit upon Cocklerye. Wi' gleg, observant een, I pass't By sea an' land, through East an' Wast, And still in ilka age an' station Saw naething but abomination. In thir uncovenantit lands The gangrel Scot uplifts his hands At lack of a' sectarian füsh'n, An' cauld religious destitütion. He rins, puir man, frae place to place, Tries a' their graceless means o' grace, Preacher on preacher, kirk on kirk— This yin a stot an' thon a stirk— A bletherin' clan, no warth a preen, As bad as Smith of Aiberdeen! At last, across the weary faem, Frae far, outlandish pairts I came. On ilka side o' me I fand Fresh tokens o' my native land. Wi' whatna joy I hailed them a'— The hilltaps standin' raw by raw, The public house, the Hielan' birks, And a' the bonny U.P. kirks! But maistly thee, the bluid o' Scots, Frae Maidenkirk to John o' Grots, The king o' drinks, as I conceive it, Talisker, Isla, or Glenlivet! For after years wi' a pockmantie Frae Zanzibar to Alicante, In mony a fash and sair affliction I gie't as my sincere conviction— Of a' their foreign tricks an' pliskies, I maist abominate their whiskies. Nae doot, themsel's, they ken it weel, An' wi' a hash o' leemon peel, And ice an' siccan filth, they ettle The stawsome kind o' goo to settle; Sic wersh apothecary's broos wi' As Scotsmen scorn to fyle their moo's wi'. An' man, I was a blithe hame-comer Whan first I syndit out my rummer. Ye should hae seen me then, wi' care The less important pairts prepare; Syne, weel contentit wi' it a', Pour in the speerits wi' a jaw! I didnae drink, I didnae speak— I only snowkit up the reek. I was sae pleased therein to paidle, I sat an' plowtered wi' my ladle. An' blithe was I, the morrow's morn, To daunder through the stookit corn, And after a' my strange mishanters, Sit doun amang my ain dissenters. An', man, it was a joy to me The pu'pit an' the pews to see, The pennies dirlin' in the plate, The elders lookin' on in state; An' 'mang the first, as it befell, Wha should I see, sir, but yoursel'. I was, and I will no deny it, At the first gliff a hantle tryit. To see yoursel' in sic a station— It seemed a doubtfü' dispensation. The feelin' was a mere digression; For shüne I understood the session, An' mindin' Aiken an' M'Neil, I wondered they had düne sae weel. I saw I had mysel' to blame; For had I but remained at hame, Aiblins—though no ava' deservin' 't— They micht hae named your humble servant. The kirk was filled, the door was steeked; Up to the pu'pit ance I keeked; I was mair pleased than I can tell— It was the minister himsel'! Proud, proud was I to see his face, After sae lang awa' frae grace. Pleased as I was, I'm no denyin' Some maitters were not edifyin'; For first I fand—an' here was news!— Mere hymn-books cockin' in the pews— A humanised abomination, Unfit for ony congregation. Syne, while I still was on the tenter, I scunnered at the new prezentor; I thocht him gesterin' an' cauld— A sair declension frae the auld. Syne, as though a' the faith was wreckit, The prayer was not what I'd exspeckit. Himsel', as it appeared to me, Was no the man he üsed to be. But just as I was growin' vext He waled a maist judeecious text, An', launchin' into his prelections, Swoopt, wi' a skirl, on a' defections. O what a gale was on my speerit To hear the p'ints o' doctrine clearit, And a' the horrors o' damnation Set furth wi' faithfü' ministration! Nae shauchlin' testimony here— We were a' damned, an' that was clear. I owned, wi' gratitude an' wonder, He was a pleisure to sit under. XIII [Late in the nicht in bed I lay] Late in the nicht in bed I lay, The winds were at their weary play, An' tirlin' wa's an' skirlin' wae Through Heev'n they battered; On-ding o' hail, on-blaff o' spray, The tempest blattered. The masoned house it dinled through; It dung the ship, it cowped the coo'; The rankit aiks it overthrew, Had braved a' weathers; The strang sea-gleds it took an' blew Awa' like feathers. The thrawes o' fear on a' were shed, An' the hair rose, an' slumber fled, An' lichts were lit an' prayers were said Through a' the kintry; An' the cauld terror clum in bed Wi' a' an' sindry. To hear in the pit-mirk on hie The brangled collieshangie flie, The warl', they thocht, wi' land an' sea, Itsel' wad cowpit; An' for auld airn, the smashed debris By God be rowpit. Meanwhile frae far Aldeboran To folks wi' talescopes in han', O' ships that cowpit, winds that ran, Nae sign was seen, But the wee warl' in sunshine span As bricht's a preen. I, tae, by God's especial grace, Dwall denty in a bieldy place, Wi' hosened feet, wi' shaven face, Wi' dacent mainners: A grand example to the race O' tautit sinners! The wind may blaw, the heathen rage, The deil may start on the rampage; The sick in bed, the thief in cage— What's a' to me? Cosh in my house, a sober sage, I sit an' see. An' whiles the bluid spangs to my bree, To lie sae saft, to live sae free, While better men maun do an' die In unco places. ‘Whaur's God?’ I cry, an' ‘Whae is me To hae sic graces?’ I mind the fecht the sailors keep, But fire or can'le, rest or sleep, In darkness an' the muckle deep; An' mind beside The herd that on the hills o' sheep Has wandered wide. I mind me on the hoastin' weans— The penny joes on causey stanes— The auld folk wi' the crazy banes, Baith auld an' puir, That aye maun thole the winds an' rains An' labour sair. An' whiles I'm kind o' pleased a blink An' kind o' fleyed forby, to think, For a' my rowth o' meat an' drink An' waste o' crumb, I'll mebbe have to thole wi' skink In Kingdom Come. For God whan jowes the Judgment bell, Wi' His ain Hand, His Leevin' Sel', Sall ryve the guid (as Prophets tell) Frae them that had it; And in the reamin' pat o' Hell, The rich be scaddit. O Lord, if this indeed be sae, Let daw that sair an' happy day! Again' the warl', grawn auld an' gray, Up wi' your aixe! An' let the puir enjoy their play— I'll thole my paiks. XIV My Conscience! Of a' the ills that flesh can fear, The loss o' frien's, the lack o' gear, A yowlin' tyke, a glandered mear, A lassie's nonsense— There's just ae thing I cannae bear, An' that's my conscience. Whan day (an' a' excüse) has gane, An' wark is düne, and duty's plain, An' to my chalmer a' my lane I creep apairt, My conscience! hoo the yammerin' pain Stends to my heart! A' day wi' various ends in view The hairsts o' time I had to pu', An' made a hash wad staw a soo, Let be a man!— My conscience! whan my han's were fu', Whaur were ye than? An' there were a' the lures o' life, There pleesure skirlin' on the fife, There anger, wi' the hotchin' knife Ground shairp in Hell— My conscience!—you that's like a wife!— Whaur was yoursel'? I ken it fine: just waitin' here, To gar the evil waur appear, To clart the guid, confüse the clear, Mis-ca' the great, My conscience! an' to raise a steer Whan a's ower late. Sic-like, some tyke grawn auld and blind, Whan thieves brok' through the gear to p'ind, Has lain his dozened length an' grinned At the disaster; An' the morn's mornin', wud's the wind, Yokes on his master. XV To Doctor John Brown (Whan the dear doctor, dear to a', Was still amang us here belaw, I set my pipes his praise to blaw Wi' a' my speerit; But noo, Dear Doctor! he's awa', An' ne'er can hear it.) By Lyne and Tyne, by Thames and Tees, By a' the various river-Dee's, In Mars and Manors 'yont the seas Or here at hame, Whaure'er there's kindly folk to please, They ken your name. They ken your name, they ken your tyke They ken the honey from your byke; But mebbe after a' your fyke, (The trüth to tell) It's just your honest Rab they like, An' no yoursel'. As at the gowff, some canny play'r Should tee a common ba' wi' care— Should flourish and deleever fair His souple shintie— An' the ba' rise into the air, A leevin' lintie: Sae in the game we writers play, There comes to some a bonny day, When a dear ferlie shall repay Their years o' strife, An' like your Rab, their things o' clay, Spreid wings o' life. Ye scarce deserved it, I'm afraid— You that had never learned the trade, But just some idle mornin' strayed Into the schüle, An' picked the fiddle up an' played Like Neil himsel'. Your e'e was gleg, your fingers dink; Ye didnae fash yoursel' to think, But wove, as fast as puss can link, Your denty wab: Ye stapped your pen into the ink, An' there was Rab! Sinsyne, whaure'er your fortune lay By dowie den, by canty brae, Simmer an' winter, nicht an' day, Rab was aye wi' ye; An' a' the folk on a' the way Were blithe to see ye. O sir, the gods are kind indeed, An' hauld ye for an honoured heid, That for a wee bit clarkit screed Sae weel reward ye, An' lend—puir Rabbie bein' deid— His ghaist to guard ye. For though, whaure'er yoursel' may be, We've just to turn an' glisk a wee, An' Rab at heel we're shüre to see Wi' gladsome caper: The bogle of a bogle, he— A ghaist o' paper! And as the auld-farrand hero sees In Hell a bogle Hercules, Pit there the lesser deid to please, While he himsel' Dwalls wi' the muckle gods at ease Far raised frae hell: Sae the true Rabbie far has gane On kindlier business o' his ain Wi' aulder frien's; an' his breist-bane An' stumpie tailie, He birstles at a new hearth stane By James and Ailie. XVI [It's an owercome sooth for age an' youth] It's an owercome sooth for age an' youth And it brooks wi' nae denial, That the dearest friends are the auldest friends And the young are just on trial. There's a rival bauld wi' young an' auld And it's him that has bereft me; For the sürest friends are the auldest friends And the maist o' mines hae left me. There are kind hearts still, for friends to fill And fools to take and break them; But the nearest friends are the auldest friends And the grave's the place to seek them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BALLADS The Song of Rahéro A Legend of Tahiti TO ORI A ORI Ori, my brother in the island mode, In every tongue and meaning much my friend, This story of your country and your clan, In your loved house, your too much honoured guest, I made in English. Take it, being done; And let me sign it with the name you gave. Teriitera I. THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA It fell in the days of old, as the men of Taiárapu tell, A youth went forth to the fishing, and fortune favoured him well. Támatéa his name: gullible, simple, and kind, Comely of countenance, nimble of body, empty of mind, His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife, Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life. Alone from the sea and the fishing came Támatéa the fair, Urging his boat to the beach, and the mother awaited him there, —‘Long may you live!’ said she. ‘Your fishing has sped to a wish. And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish. For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land, Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand, The hours and the miles are counted, the tributes numbered and weighed, And woe to him that comes short, and woe to him that delayed!’ So spoke on the beach the mother, and counselled the wiser thing. For Rahéro stirred in the country and secretly mined the king. Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought, In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought. And when last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped, And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead, Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing, For there was the aito dead, and he of the house of the king. So spake on the beach the mother, matter worthy of note, And wattled a basket well, and chose a fish from the boat; And Támatéa the pliable shouldered the basket and went, And travelled, and sang as he travelled, a lad that was well content. Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast, Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most. On his left, with smoke as of battle, the billows battered the land; Unscalable, turreted mountains rose on the inner hand. And cape, and village, and river, and vale, and mountain above, Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love; And never the name of a place, but lo! a song in its praise: Ancient and unforgotten, songs of the earlier days, That the elders taught to the young, and at night, in the full of the moon, Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune. Támatéa the placable went with a lingering foot; He sang as loud as a bird, he whistled hoarse as a flute; He broiled in the sun, he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees, In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees; And still in his empty mind crowded, a thousand-fold, The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old. And now was he come to a place Taiárapu honoured the most, Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast, Spewing a level river. There was a haunt of Pai. There, in his potent youth, when his parents drove him to die, Honoura lived like a beast, lacking the lamp and the fire, Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire; And there, so mighty his hands, he bent the tree to his foot— So keen the spur of his hunger, he plucked it naked of fruit. There, as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills, Ahupu, the woman of song, walked on high on the hills. Of these was Rahéro sprung, a man of a godly race; And inherited cunning of spirit and beauty of body and face. Of yore in his youth, as an aito, Rahéro wandered the land, Delighting maids with his tongue, smiting men with his hand. Famous he was in his youth; but before the midst of his life Paused, and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife. House of mine (it went), house upon the sea, Belov'd of all my fathers, more belov'd by me! Vale of the strong Honoura, deep ravine of Pai, Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry. House of mine, in your walls, strong sounds the sea, Of all sounds on earth, dearest sound to me. I have heard the applause of men, I have heard it arise and die: Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry. These were the words of his singing, other the thought of his heart; For secret desire of glory vexed him, dwelling apart. Lazy and crafty he was, and loved to lie in the sun, And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun; Lazy he was, his roof was ragged, his table was lean, And the fish swam safe in his sea, and he gathered the near and the green. He sat in his house and laughed, but he loathed the king of the land, And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand. Treason spread from his door; and he looked for a day to come, A day of the crowding people, a day of the summoning drum, When the vote should be taken, the king be driven forth in disgrace, And Rahéro, the laughing and lazy, sit and rule in his place. Here Támatéa came, and beheld the house on the brook; And Rahéro was there by the way and covered an oven to cook. Naked he was to the loins, but the tattoo covered the lack, And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back. Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet, And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat; For he marked the basket carried, covered from flies and the sun; And Rahéro buried his fire, but the meat in his house was done. Forth he stepped; and took, and delayed the boy, by the hand; And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land: —‘Our sires of old in Taiárapu, they that created the race, Ate ever with eager hand, nor regarded season or place, Ate in the boat at the oar, on the way afoot; and at night Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite. It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire; And behold how fitting the time! for here do I cover my fire.’ —‘I see the fire for the cooking but never the meat to cook,’ Said Támatéa.—‘Tut!’ said Rahéro. ‘Here in the brook And there in the tumbling sea, the fishes are thick as flies, Hungry like healthy men, and like pigs for savour and size: Crayfish crowding the river, sea-fish thronging the sea.’ —‘Well it may be,’ says the other, ‘and yet be nothing to me. Fain would I eat, but alas! I have needful matter in hand, Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land.’ Now at the word a light sprang in Rahéro's eyes. ‘I will gain me a dinner,’ thought he, ‘and lend the king a surprise.’ And he took the lad by the arm, as they stood by the side of the track, And smiled, and rallied, and flattered, and pushed him forward and back. It was ‘You that sing like a bird, I never have heard you sing,’ And ‘The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king. And of what account is an hour, when the heart is empty of guile? But come, and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile; And I will but drop my hook, and behold! the dinner made.’ So Támatéa the pliable hung up his fish in the shade On a tree by the side of the way; and Rahéro carried him in, Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin, And chose him a shining hook, and viewed it with sedulous eye, And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh, And set a mat for the gull, and bade him be merry and bide, Like a man concerned for his guest, and the fishing, and nothing beside. Now when Rahéro was forth, he paused and hearkened, and heard The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word; And stealthily crossed to the side of the way, to the shady place Where the basket hung on a mango; and craft transfigured his face. Deftly he opened the basket, and took of the fat of the fish, The cut of kings and chieftains, enough for a goodly dish. This he wrapped in a leaf, set on the fire to cook And buried; and next the marred remains of the tribute he took, And doubled and packed them well, and covered the basket close —‘There is a buffet, my king,’ quoth he, ‘and a nauseous dose!’— And hung the basket again in the shade, in a cloud of flies —‘And there is a sauce to your dinner, king of the crafty eyes!’ Soon as the oven was open, the fish smelt excellent good. In the shade, by the house of Rahéro, down they sat to their food, And cleared the leaves in silence, or uttered a jest and laughed, And raising the cocoanut bowls, buried their faces and quaffed. But chiefly in silence they ate; and soon as the meal was done, Rahéro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun, And ‘Támatéa,’ quoth he, ‘it is time to be jogging, my lad.’ So Támatéa arose, doing ever the thing he was bade, And carelessly shouldered the basket, and kindly saluted his host; And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast. Long he went; and at length was aware of a pleasant green, And the stems and shadows of palms, and roofs of lodges between There sate, in the door of his palace, the king on a kingly seat, And aitos stood armed around, and the yottowas sat at his feet. But fear was a worm in his heart: fear darted his eyes; And he probed men's faces for treasons and pondered their speech for lies. To him came Támatéa, the basket slung in his hand, And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand. In silence hearkened the king, and closed the eyes in his face, Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base; In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away. So Támatéa departed, turning his back on the day. And lo! as the king sat brooding, a rumour rose in the crowd; The yottowas nudged and whispered, the commons murmured aloud; Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing, At the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king. And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame In their midst; and the heart in his body was water and then was flame; Till of a sudden, turning, he gripped an aito hard, A youth that stood with his ómare, one of the daily guard, And spat in his ear a command, and pointed and uttered a name, And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame. Now Támatéa the fool was far on the homeward way, The rising night in his face, behind him the dying day. Rahéro saw him go by, and the heart of Rahéro was glad, Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad; And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well, For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell; And pleased with the notice of folk, and pleased that his journey was done, Támatéa drew homeward, turning his back to the sun. And now was the hour of the bath in Taiárapu: far and near The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear. Night massed in the valleys; the sun on the mountain coast Struck, end-long; and above the clouds embattled their host, And glowed and gloomed on the heights; and the heads of the palms were gems, And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems; And the shadow of Támatéa hovered already at home. And sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam Struck on his ear; and he turned, and lo! a man on his track, Girded and armed with an ómare, following hard at his back. At a bound the man was upon him;—and, or ever a word was said, The loaded end of the ómare fell and laid him dead. II. THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA Thus was Rahéro's treason; thus and no further it sped. The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead. But the mother of Támatéa arose with death in her eyes. All night long, and the next, Taiárapu rang with her cries. As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt And perceives nor home, nor friends, for the trees have closed her about, The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair: So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air For awhile, and pierced men's hearing in vain, and wounded their hearts. But as when the weather changes at sea, in dangerous parts, And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky, At once the ship lies idle, the sails hang silent on high, The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp, And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp: So sudden, the voice of her weeping ceased; in silence she rose And passed from the house of her sorrow, a woman clothed with repose, Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death with her hand. Hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land. They tell that she feared not to slumber alone, in the dead of night, In accursed places; beheld, unblenched, the ribbon of light Spin from temple to temple; guided the perilous skiff, Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff; From end to end of the island, thought not the distance long, But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong. To king after king, as they sat in the palace door, she came, Claiming kinship, declaiming verses, naming her name And the names of all of her fathers; and still, with a heart on the rack, Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back: So would deceive them awhile, and change and return in a breath, And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death; And tempt her kings—for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous land, And flatter—for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand? And change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song, Invoking the beaten drums, beholding the fall of the strong, Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead. And they held the chin in silence, and heard her, and shook the head; For they knew the men of Taiárapu famous in battle and feast, Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least. To the land of the Námunu-úra, to Paea, at length she came, To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and name. There was she well received, and spoke with Hiopa the king. And Hiopa listened, and weighed, and wisely considered the thing. ‘Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place,’ Quoth he to the woman, ‘in quiet, a weak and peaceable race. But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Taiárapu lies; Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face, and cries Aloud in the top of arduous mountains, and utters its song In green continuous forests. Strong is the wind, and strong And fruitful and hardy the race, famous in battle and feast, Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least. Now hearken to me, my daughter, and hear a word of the wise: How a strength goes linked with a weakness, two by two, like the eyes. They can wield the ómare well and cast the javelin far; Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are. Plant we, then, here at Paea, a garden of excellent fruits; Plant we bananas and kava and taro, the king of roots; Let the pigs in Paea be tapu and no man fish for a year; And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here. So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island, and so, At last, on the tongue of rumour, go where we wish it to go. Then shall the pigs of Taiárapu raise their snouts in the air; But we sit quiet and wait, as the fowler sits by the snare, And tranquilly fold our hands, till the pigs come nosing the food: But meanwhile build us a house of Trotéa, the stubborn wood, Bind it with incombustible thongs, set a roof to the room, Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume; And there, when the pigs come trotting, there shall the feast be spread, There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead. So be it done; for I have a heart that pities your state, And Nateva and Námunu-úra are fire and water for hate.’ All was done as he said, and the gardens prospered; and now The fame of their plenty went out, and word of it came to Vaiau. For the men of Námunu-úra sailed, to the windward far, Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are, And cast overboard of their plenty; and lo! at the Tevas' feet The surf on all of the beaches tumbled treasures of meat. In the salt of the sea, a harvest tossed with the refluent foam; And the children gleaned it in playing, and ate and carried it home; And the elders stared and debated, and wondered and passed the jest, But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest; And little by little, from one to another, the word went round: ‘In all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground, And swine are plenty as rats. And now, when they fare to the sea, The men of the Námunu-úra glean from under the tree And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat; And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat, The steersman eats at the helm, the rowers munch at the oar, And at length, when their bellies are full, overboard with the store!’ Now was the word made true, and soon as the bait was bare, All the pigs of Taiárapu raised their snouts in the air. Songs were recited, and kinship was counted, and tales were told How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old The clans of the island. ‘To war,’ said they, ‘now set we an end, And hie to the Námunu-úra even as a friend to a friend.’ So judged, and a day was named; and soon as the morning broke, Canoes were thrust in the sea and the houses emptied of folk. Strong blew the wind of the south, the wind that gathers the clan; Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran; And the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountain-high, A mountain throned on a mountain. The fleet of canoes swept by In the midst, on the green lagoon, with a crew released from care, Sailing an even water, breathing a summer air, Cheered by a cloudless sun; and ever to left and right, Bursting surge on the reef, drenching storms on the height. So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day, Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay By all the towns of the Tevas; and still as they bowled along, Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song, And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree, Hailing and cheering. Time failed them for more to do; The holiday village careened to the wind, and was gone from view Swift as a passing bird; and ever as onward it bore, Like the cry of the passing bird, bequeathed its song to the shore— Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child. And the gazer, left behind, stared at the wake and smiled. By all the towns of the Tevas they went, and Pápara last, The home of the chief, the place of muster in war; and passed The march of the lands of the clan, to the lands of an alien folk. And there, from the dusk of the shoreside palms, a column of smoke Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun, ‘Paea!’ they cried. ‘It is Paea.’ And so was the voyage done. In the early fall of the night, Hiopa came to the shore, And beheld and counted the comers, and lo, they were forty score: The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played, The clean-lipped smile of the boy, the slender breasts of the maid, And mighty limbs of women, stalwart mothers of men. The sires stood forth unabashed; but a little back from his ken Clustered the scarcely nubile, the lads and maids, in a ring, Fain of each other, afraid of themselves, aware of the king And aping behaviour, but clinging together with hands and eyes, With looks that were kind like kisses, and laughter tender as sighs. There, too, the grandsire stood, raising his silver crest, And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast. The childhood of love, the pair well married, the innocent brood, The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed— Hiopa beheld them together, all the ages of man, And a moment shook in his purpose. But these were the foes of his clan, And he trod upon pity, and came, and civilly greeted the king, And gravely entreated Rahéro; and for all that could fight or sing, And claimed a name in the land, had fitting phrases of praise; But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient days. And ‘'Tis true,’ said he, ‘that in Paea the victual rots on the ground; But, friends, your number is many; and pigs must be hunted and found, And the lads troop to the mountains to bring the féis down, And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town. So, for to-night, sleep here; but king, common, and priest To-morrow, in order due, shall sit with me in the feast.’ Sleepless the live-long night, Hiopa's followers toiled. The pigs screamed and were slaughtered; the spars of the guest-house oiled, The leaves spread on the floor. In many a mountain glen The moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men Plucking and bearing fruits; and in all the bounds of the town Red glowed the cocoanut fires, and were buried and trodden down. Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan, But the eighth wrought with his lads, hid from the sight of man. In the deeps of the woods they laboured, piling the fuel high In faggots, the load of a man, fuel seasoned and dry, Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame. And now was the day of the feast. The forests, as morning came, Tossed in the wind, and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day And the cocoanuts showered on the ground, rebounding and rolling away: A glorious morn for a feast, a famous wind for a fire. To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them, mother and sire And maid and babe in a tale, the whole of the holiday throng. Smiling they came, garlanded green, not dreaming of wrong; And for every three, a pig, tenderly cooked in the ground, Waited; and féi, the staff of life, heaped in a mound For each where he sat;—for each, bananas roasted and raw Piled with a bountiful hand, as for horses hay and straw Are stacked in a stable; and fish, the food of desire, And plentiful vessels of sauce, and breadfruit gilt in the fire; And kava was common as water. Feasts have there been ere now, And many, but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau. All day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes, And turned from the pigs to the fish, and again from the fish to the fruits, And emptied the vessels of sauce, and drank of the kava deep; Till the young lay stupid as stones, and the strongest nodded to sleep. Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night Tethered them hand and foot; and their souls were drowned, and the light Was cloaked from their eyes. Senseless together, the old and the young, The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue, The woman wedded and fruitful, inured to the pangs of birth, And the maid that knew not of kisses, blindly sprawled on the earth. From the hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth. Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north; But the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn, Showering the nuts in the dusk, and e'en as a banner is torn, High on the peaks of the island, shattered the mountain cloud. And now at once, at a signal, a silent, emulous crowd Set hands to the work of death, hurrying to and fro, Like ants, to furnish the faggots, building them broad and low, And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall. Silence persisted within, for sleep lay heavy on all; But the mother of Támatéa stood at Hiopa's side, And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride. Night fell on the toilers, and first Hiopa the wise Made the round of the house, visiting all with his eyes; And all was piled to the eaves, and fuel blockaded the door; And within, in the house beleaguered, slumbered the forty score. Then was an aito dispatched and came with fire in his hand, And Hiopa took it.—‘Within,’ said he, ‘is the life of a land; And behold! I breathe on the coal, I breathe on the dales of the east, And silence falls on forest and shore; the voice of the feast Is quenched, and the smoke of cooking; the rooftree decays and falls On the empty lodge, and the winds subvert deserted walls.’ Therewithal, to the fuel, he laid the glowing coal; And the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a mole, And copious smoke was conceived. But, as when a dam is to burst, The water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first, And then, of a sudden, whelms and bears it away forthright: So now, in a moment, the flame sprang and towered in the night, And wrestled and roared in the wind, and high over house and tree, Stood, like a streaming torch, enlightening land and sea. But the mother of Támatéa threw her arms abroad, ‘Pyre of my son,’ she shouted, ‘debited vengeance of God, Late, late, I behold you, yet I behold you at last, And glory, beholding! For now are the days of my agony past, The lust that famished my soul now eats and drinks its desire, And they that encompassed my son shrivel alive in the fire. Tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years! Ye quenched the voice of my singer?—hark, in your dying ears, The song of the conflagration! Ye left me a widow alone? —Behold, the whole of your race consumes, sinew and bone And torturing flesh together: man, mother, and maid Heaped in a common shambles; and already, borne by the trade, The smoke of your dissolution darkens the stars of night.’ Thus she spoke, and her stature grew in the people's sight. III. RAHÉRO Rahéro was there in the hall asleep: beside him his wife, Comely, a mirthful woman, one that delighted in life; And a girl that was ripe for marriage, shy and sly as a mouse; And a boy, a climber of trees: all the hopes of his house. Unwary, with open hands, he slept in the midst of his folk, And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without, and awoke, Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears. A hellish glow and clouds were about him;—it roared in his ears Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep; And Rahéro swayed as he stood, and his reason was still asleep. Now the flame struck hard on the house, wind-wielded, a fracturing blow, And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below; And the lofty hall, and the feast, and the prostrate bodies of folk, Shone red in his eyes a moment, and then were swallowed of smoke. In the mind of Rahéro clearness came; and he opened his throat; And as when a squall comes sudden, the straining sail of a boat Thunders aloud and bursts, so thundered the voice of the man. —‘The wind and the rain!’ he shouted, the mustering word of the clan, And ‘up!’ and ‘to arms, men of Vaiau!’ But silence replied, Or only the voice of the gusts of the fire, and nothing beside. Rahéro stooped and groped. He handled his womankind, But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their mind, And they lay like pillars prone; and his hand encountered the boy, And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy. ‘Him can I save!’ he thought, ‘if I were speedy enough.’ And he loosened the cloth from his loins, and swaddled the child in the stuff; And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well. There where the roof had fallen, it roared like the mouth of hell. Thither Rahéro went, stumbling on senseless folk, And grappled a post of the house, and began to climb in the smoke: The last alive of Vaiau; and the son borne by the sire. The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire, And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs; And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes; And still he climbed, and came to the top, the place of proof, And thrust a hand through the flame, and clambered alive on the roof. But even as he did so, the wind, in a garment of flames and pain, Wrapped him from head to heel; and the waistcloth parted in twain; And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below. About the blazing feast-house clustered the eyes of the foe, Watching, hand upon weapon, lest ever a soul should flee, Shading the brow from the glare, straining the neck to see. Only, to leeward, the flames in the wind swept far and wide, And the forest sputtered on fire; and there might no man abide. Thither Rahéro crept, and dropped from the burning eaves, And crouching low to the ground, in a treble covert of leaves And fire and volleying smoke, ran for the life of his soul Unseen; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal, Cairned with a wonder of flame, and blotting the night with smoke, Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk. He fled unguided at first; but hearing the breakers roar, Thitherward shaped his way, and came at length to the shore. Sound-limbed he was: dry-eyed; but smarted in every part; And the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart With sorrow and rage. And ‘Fools!’ he cried, ‘fools of Vaiau, Heads of swine—gluttons—Alas! and where are they now? Those that I played with, those that nursed me, those that I nursed? God, and I outliving them! I, the least and the worst— I, that thought myself crafty, snared by this herd of swine, In the tortures of hell and desolate, stripped of all that was mine: All!—my friends and my fathers—the silver heads of yore That trooped to the council, the children that ran to the open door Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father's knees! And mine, my wife—my daughter—my sturdy climber of trees, Ah, never to climb again!’ Thus in the dusk of the night (For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight), Pacing and gnawing his fists, Rahéro raged by the shore. Vengeance: that must be his. But much was to do before; And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place, A life, the root of revenge, surviving plant of the race: And next the race to be raised anew, and the lands of the clan Repeopled. So Rahéro designed, a prudent man Even in wrath, and turned for the means of revenge and escape: A boat to be seized by stealth, a wife to be taken by rape. Still was the dark lagoon; beyond on the coral wall, He saw the breakers shine, he heard them bellow and fall. Alone, on the top of the reef, a man with a flaming brand Walked, gazing and pausing, a fish-spear poised in his hand. The foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came, And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame. Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait: A figure dimly guiding it: surely the fisherman's mate. Rahéro saw and he smiled. He straightened his mighty thews: Naked, with never a weapon, and covered with scorch and bruise, He straightened his arms, he filled the void of his body with breath, And, strong as the wind in his manhood, doomed the fisher to death. Silent he entered the water, and silently swam, and came There where the fisher walked, holding on high the flame. Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea; And hard at the back of the man, Rahéro crept to his knee On the coral, and suddenly sprang and seized him, the elder hand Clutching the joint of his throat, the other snatching the brand Ere it had time to fall, and holding it steady and high. Strong was the fisher, brave, and swift of mind and of eye— Strongly he threw in the clutch; but Rahéro resisted the strain, And jerked, and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain, And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet. One moment: and there, on the reef, where the breakers whitened and beat, Rahéro was standing alone, glowing and scorched and bare, A victor unknown of any, raising the torch in the air. But once he drank of his breath, and instantly set him to fish Like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish. For what should the woman have seen? A man with a torch—and then A moment's blur of the eyes—and a man with a torch again. And the torch had scarcely been shaken. ‘Ah, surely,’ Rahéro said, ‘She will deem it a trick of the eyes, a fancy born in the head; But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool's belief.’ So for a while, a sedulous fisher, he walked the reef, Pausing at times and gazing, striking at times with the spear: —Lastly, uttered the call; and even as the boat drew near, Like a man that was done with its use, tossed the torch in the sea. Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman; and she Lightly addressed him, and yielded the paddle and place to sit; For now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit. Rahéro set him to row, never a word he spoke, And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke. —‘What ails you?’ the woman asked, ‘and why did you drop the brand? We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land.’ Never a word Rahéro replied, but urged the canoe. And a chill fell on the woman.—‘Atta! speak! is it you? Speak! Why are you silent? Why do you bend aside? Wherefore steer to the seaward?’ thus she panted and cried. Never a word from the oarsman, toiling there in the dark; But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark, And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep, Drove her, the little fitted, forth on the open deep. And fear, there where she sat, froze the woman to stone: Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone; But a keener fear of the night, the dark, and the ghostly hour, And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal's power And more than a mortal's boldness. For much she knew of the dead That haunt and fish upon reefs, toiling, like men, for bread, And traffic with human fishers, or slay them and take their ware, Till the hour when the star of the dead goes down, and the morning air Blows, and the cocks are singing on shore. And surely she knew The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave. It blew All night from the south; all night, Rahéro contended and kept The prow to the cresting sea; and, silent as though she slept, The woman huddled and quaked. And now was the peep of day. High and long on their left the mountainous island lay; And over the peaks of Taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck. On shore the birds were beginning to sing: the ghostly ruck Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave; And here on the sea, the woman, waxing suddenly brave, Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man. And sure he was none that she knew, none of her country or clan: A stranger, mother-naked, and marred with the marks of fire, But comely and great of stature, a man to obey and admire. And Rahéro regarded her also, fixed, with a frowning face, Judging the woman's fitness to mother a warlike race. Broad of shoulder, ample of girdle, long in the thigh, Deep of bosom she was, and bravely supported his eye. ‘Woman,’ said he, ‘last night the men of your folk— Man, woman, and maid, smothered my race in smoke. It was done like cowards; and I, a mighty man of my hands, Escaped, a single life; and now to the empty lands And smokeless hearths of my people, sail, with yourself, alone. Before your mother was born, the die of to-day was thrown And you selected:—your husband, vainly striving, to fall Broken between these hands:—yourself to be severed from all, The places, the people, you love—home, kindred, and clan— And to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man.’ The Feast of Famine Marquesan Manners I. THE PRIEST'S VIGIL In all the land of the tribe was neither fish nor fruit, And the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot. The clans upon the left and the clans upon the right Now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright; They gat them to the thicket, to the deepest of the shade, And lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade. And oft in the starry even the song of morning rose, What time the oven smoked in the country of their foes; For oft to loving hearts, and waiting ears and sight, The lads that went to forage returned not with the night. Now first the children sickened, and then the women paled, And the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed. Hushed was the deep drum, discarded was the dance; And those that met the priest now glanced at him askance. The priest was a man of years, his eyes were ruby-red, He neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead, He knew the songs of races, the names of ancient date; And the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief's estate. He dwelt in a high-built lodge, hard by the roaring shore, Raised on a noble terrace and with tikis at the door. Within it was full of riches, for he served his nation well, And full of the sound of breakers, like the hollow of a shell. For weeks he let them perish, gave never a helping sign, But sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine, But sat on his high terrace, with the tikis by his side, And stared on the blue ocean, like a parrot, ruby-eyed. Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height: Out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light, Up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun;— But down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun. In the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa-husk, And the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk, A word that began to go round, a word, a whisper, a start: Hope that leaped in the bosom, fear that knocked on the heart: ‘See, the priest is not risen—look, for his door is fast! He is going to name the victims; he is going to help us at last.’ Thrice rose the sun to noon; and ever, like one of the dead, The priest lay still in his house with the roar of the sea in his head; There was never a foot on the floor, there was never a whisper of speech; Only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach. Again were the mountains fired, again the morning broke; And all the houses lay still, but the house of the priest awoke. Close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan, But the agèd, red-eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man; And the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again, In the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain. Frenzy shook in his limbs, frenzy shone in his eyes, And still and again as he ran, the valley rang with his cries. All day long in the land, by cliff and thicket and den, Heran his lunatic rounds, and howled for the flesh of men; All day long he ate not, nor ever drank of the brook; And all day long in their houses the people listened and shook— All day long in their houses they listened with bated breath, And never a soul went forth, for the sight of the priest was death. Three were the days of his running, as the gods appointed of yore, Two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore: The drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees, On the sacred stones of the High-place under the sacred trees; With a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast, And the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest. Last, when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree, And the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea, And all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk, The wreck of the red-eyed priest came gasping home in the dusk. He reeled across the village, he staggered along the shore, And between the leering tikis crept groping through his door. There went a stir through the lodges, the voice of speech awoke; Once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke. And those who were mighty in war, and those renowned for an art Sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart. II. THE LOVERS Hark! away in the woods—for the ears of love are sharp— Stealthily, quietly touched, the note of the one-stringed harp. In the lighted house of her father, why should Taheia start? Taheia heavy of hair, Taheia tender of heart, Taheia the well-descended, a bountiful dealer in love, Nimble of foot like the deer, and kind of eye like the dove? Sly and shy as a cat, with never a change of face, Taheia slips to the door, like one that would breathe a space; Saunters and pauses, and looks at the stars, and lists to the seas; Then sudden and swift as a cat, she plunges under the trees. Swift as a cat she runs, with her garment gathered high, Leaping, nimble of foot, running, certain of eye; And ever to guide her way over the smooth and the sharp, Ever nearer and nearer the note of the one-stringed harp; Till at length, in a glade of the wood, with a naked mountain above, The sound of the harp thrown down, and she in the arms of her love. ‘Rua,’—‘Taheia,’ they cry—‘my heart, my soul, and my eyes,’ And clasp and sunder and kiss, with lovely laughter and sighs, ‘Rua!’—‘Taheia, my love,’—‘Rua, star of my night, Clasp me, hold me, and love me, single spring of delight.’ And Rua folded her close, he folded her near and long, The living knit to the living, and sang the lover's song: Night, night it is, night upon the palms. Night, night it is, the land wind has blown. Starry, starry night, over deep and height; Love, love in the valley, love all alone. ‘Taheia, heavy of hair, a foolish thing have we done, To bind what gods have sundered unkindly into one. Why should a lowly lover have touched Taheia's skirt, Taheia the well-descended, and Rua child of the dirt?’ ‘—On high with the haka-ikis my father sits in state, Ten times fifty kinsmen salute him in the gate; Round all his martial body, and in bands across his face, The marks of the tattooer proclaim his lofty place. I too, in the hands of the cunning, in the sacred cabin of palm, Have shrunk like the mimosa, and bleated like the lamb; Round half my tender body, that none shall clasp but you, For a crest and a fair adornment go dainty lines of blue. Love, love, beloved Rua, love levels all degrees, And the well-tattooed Taheia clings panting to your knees.’ ‘—Taheia, song of the morning, how long is the longest love? A cry, a clasp of the hands, a star that falls from above! Ever at morn in the blue, and at night when all is black, Ever it skulks and trembles with the hunter, Death, on its track. Hear me, Taheia, death! For to-morrow the priest shall awake, And the names be named of the victims to bleed for the nation's sake; And first of the numbered many that shall be slain ere noon, Rua the child of the dirt, Rua the kinless loon. For him shall the drum be beat, for him be raised the song, For him to the sacred High-place the chaunting people throng, For him the oven smoke as for a speechless beast, And the sire of my Taheia come greedy to the feast.’ ‘Rua, be silent, spare me. Taheia closes her ears. Pity my yearning heart, pity my girlish years! Flee from the cruel hands, flee from the knife and coal, Lie hid in the deeps of the woods, Rua, sire of my soul!’ ‘Whither to flee, Taheia, whither in all of the land? The fires of the bloody kitchen are kindled on every hand; On every hand in the isle a hungry whetting of teeth, Eyes in the trees above, arms in the brush beneath. Patience to lie in wait, cunning to follow the sleuth, Abroad the foes I have fought, and at home the friends of my youth.’ ‘Love, love, beloved Rua, love has a clearer eye, Hence from the arms of love you go not forth to die. There, where the broken mountain drops sheer into the glen. There shall you find a hold from the boldest hunter of men; There, in the deep recess, where the sun falls only at noon, And only once in the night enters the light of the moon, Nor ever a sound but of birds, or the rain when it falls with a shout; For death and the fear of death beleaguer the valley about. Tapu it is, but the gods will surely pardon despair; Tapu, but what of that? If Rua can only dare. Tapu and tapu and tapu, I know they are every one right; But the god of every tapu is not always quick to smite. Lie secret there, my Rua, in the arms of awful gods, Sleep in the shade of the trees on the couch of the kindly sods, Sleep and dream of Taheia, Taheia will wake for you; And whenever the land wind blows and the woods are heavy with dew, Alone through the horror of night, with food for the soul of her love, Taheia the undissuaded will hurry true as the dove.’ ‘Taheia, the pit of the night crawls with treacherous things, Spirits of ultimate air and the evil souls of things; The souls of the dead, the stranglers, that perch in the trees of the wood, Waiters for all things human, haters of evil and good.’ ‘Rua, behold me, kiss me, look in my eyes and read; Are these the eyes of a maid that would leave her lover in need? Brave in the eye of day, my father ruled in the fight; The child of his loins, Taheia, will play the man in the night.’ So it was spoken, and so agreed, and Taheia arose And smiled in the stars and was gone, swift as the swallow goes; And Rua stood on the hill, and sighed, and followed her flight, And there were the lodges below, each with its door alight; From folk that sat on the terrace and drew out the even long Sudden crowings of laughter, monotonous drone of song; The quiet passage of souls over his head in the trees; And from all around the haven the crumbling thunder of seas. ‘Farewell, my home,’ said Rua. ‘Farewell, O quiet seat! To-morrow in all your valleys the drum of death shall beat.’ III. THE FEAST Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the naked peak, And all the village was stirring, for now was the priest to speak. Forth on his terrace he came, and sat with the chief in talk; His lips were blackened with fever, his cheeks were whiter than chalk; Fever clutched at his hands, fever nodded his head, But, quiet and steady and cruel, his eyes shone ruby-red. In the earliest rays of the sun the chief rose up content; Braves were summoned, and drummers; messengers came and went; Braves ran to their lodges, weapons were snatched from the wall; The commons herded together, and fear was over them all. Festival dresses they wore, but the tongue was dry in their mouth, And the blinking eyes in their faces skirted from north to south. Now to the sacred enclosure gathered the greatest and least, And from under the shade of the banyan arose the voice of the feast, The frenzied roll of the drum, and a swift, monotonous song. Higher the sun swam up; the trade wind level and strong Awoke in the tops of the palms and rattled the fans aloud, And over the garlanded heads and shining robes of the crowd Tossed the spiders of shadow, scattered the jewels of sun. Forty the tale of the drums, and the forty throbbed like one; A thousand hearts in the crowd, and the even chorus of song, Swift as the feet of a runner, trampled a thousand strong. And the old men leered at the ovens and licked their lips for the food; And the women stared at the lads, and laughed and looked to the wood. As when the sweltering baker, at night, when the city is dead, Alone in the trough of labour treads and fashions the bread; So in the heat, and the reek, and the touch of woman and man, The naked spirit of evil kneaded the hearts of the clan. Now cold was at many a heart, and shaking in many a seat; For there were the empty baskets, but who was to furnish the meat? For here was the nation assembled, and there were the ovens anigh, And out of a thousand singers nine were numbered to die. Till, of a sudden, a shock, a mace in the air, a yell, And, struck in the edge of the crowd, the first of the victims fell. Terror and horrible glee divided the shrinking clan, Terror of what was to follow, glee for a diet of man. Frenzy hurried the chaunt, frenzy rattled the drums; The nobles, high on the terrace, greedily mouthed their thumbs; And once and again and again, in the ignorant crowd below, Once and again and again descended the murderous blow. Now smoked the oven, and now, with the cutting lip of a shell, A butcher of ninety winters jointed the bodies well. Unto the carven lodge, silent, in order due, The grandees of the nation one after one withdrew; And a line of laden bearers brought to the terrace foot, On poles across their shoulders, the last reserve of fruit. The victims bled for the nobles in the old appointed way; The fruit was spread for the commons, for all should eat today. And now was the kava brewed, and now the cocoa ran, Now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man; And mirth was in every heart, and a garland on every head, And all was well with the living and well with the eight who were dead. Only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted awhile: ‘To-morrow,’ they said, and ‘To-morrow,’ and nodded and seemed to smile: ‘Rua the child of dirt, the creature of common clay, Rua must die to-morrow, since Rua is gone today.’ Out of the groves of the valley, where clear the blackbirds sang, Sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain sprang; Sheer and bare it rose, unscalable barricade, Beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade. Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light, Close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night. Here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees, Or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze. High overhead, with a cry, the torrents leaped for the main, And silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain. Dark in the staring noon, dark was Rua's ravine, Damp and cold was the air, and the face of the cliffs was green. Here, in the rocky pit, accursed already of old, On a stone in the midst of a river, Rua sat and was cold. ‘Valley of mid-day shadows, valley of silent falls.’ Rua sang, and his voice went hollow about the walls, ‘Valley of shadow and rock, a doleful prison to me, What is the life you can give to a child of the sun and the sea?’ And Rua arose and came to the open mouth of the glen, Whence he beheld the woods, and the sea, and houses of men. Wide blew the riotous trade, and smelt in his nostrils good; It bowed the boats on the bay, and tore and divided the wood; It smote and sundered the groves as Moses smote with the rod, And the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad; And ever and on, in a lull, the trade wind brought him along A far-off patter of drums and a far-off whisper of song. Swift as the swallow's wings, the diligent hands on the drum Fluttered and hurried and throbbed. ‘Ah, woe that I hear you come,’ Rua cried in his grief, ‘a sorrowful sound to me, Mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea! Woe in the song! for the grave breathes in the singers' breath, And I hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death. Home of my youth! no more, through all the length of the years, No more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and tears, No more shall Rua return; no more as the evening ends, To crowded eyes of welcome, to the reaching hands of friends.’ All day long from the High-place the drums and the singing came, And the even fell, and the sun went down, a wheel of flame; And night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the wood; And silence slept on all, where Rua sorrowed and stood. But still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival rang, And still the crowd in the High-place danced and shouted and sang. Now over all the isle terror was breathed abroad Of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod; And before the nostrils of night, the shuddering hunter of men Hurried, with beard on shoulder, back to his lighted den. ‘Taheia, here to my side!’—‘Rua, my Rua, you!’ And cold from the clutch of terror, cold with the damp of the dew, Taheia, heavy of hair, leaped through the dark to his arms; Taheia leaped to his clasp, and was folded in from alarms. ‘Rua, beloved, here, see what your love has brought; Coming—alas! returning—swift as the shuttle of thought; Returning, alas! for tonight, with the beaten drum and the voice, In the shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice; And Taheia the well-descended, the daughter of chief and priest, Taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the feast.’ So it was spoken; and she, girding her garment high, Fled and was swallowed of woods, swift as the sight of an eye. Night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of stars, Then a trouble awoke in the air, the east was banded with bars; Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height; Dawn, in the deepest glen, fell a wonder of light; High and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening east, And lo! from the sides of the sea the broken sound of the feast! As, when in days of summer, through open windows, the fly Swift as a breeze and loud as a trump goes by, But when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse, Blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house: So the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night, So it staggered and drooped, and droned in the morning light. IV. THE RAID It chanced that as Rua sat in the valley of silent falls, He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls. Fire had fashioned of yore, and time had broken, the rocks; There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for flocks; And he saw on the top of the cliffs, looking up from the pit of the shade, A flicker of wings and sunshine, and trees that swung in the trade. ‘The trees swing in the trade,’ quoth Rua, doubtful of words, ‘And the sun stares from the sky, but what should trouble the birds?’ Up from the shade he gazed, where high the parapet shone, And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon. ‘What manner of things are these? Are they spirits abroad by day? Or the foes of my clan that are come, bringing death by a perilous way?’ The valley was gouged like a vessel, and round like the vessel's lip, With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a ship. On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair, And the cape overhung like a chin a gulph of sunless air. ‘Silence, heart! What is that?—that, that flickered and shone, Into the sun for an instant, and in an instant gone? Was it a warrior's plume, a warrior's girdle of hair? Swung in the loop of a rope, is he making a bridge of the air?’ Once and again Rua saw, in the trenchant edge of the sky, The giddy conjuring done. And then, in the blink of an eye, A scream caught in with the breath, a whirling packet of limbs, A lump that dived in the gulph, more swift than a dolphin swims; And there was the lump at his feet, and eyes were alive in the lump. Sick was the soul of Rua, ambushed close in a clump; Sick of soul he drew near, making his courage stout; And he looked in the face of the thing, and the life of the thing went out. And he gazed on the tattoed limbs, and, behold, he knew the man: Hoka, a chief of the Vais, the truculent foe of his clan: Hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope, Filled with the lust of war, and alive with courage and hope. Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his eyes, And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies. ‘Foes of my race!’ cried Rua, ‘the mouth of Rua is true: Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you. There was never a nobler foray, never a bolder plan; Never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man; And Rua, your evil-dealer through all the days of his years, ‘Counts it honour to hate you, honour to fall by your spears.’ And Rua straightened his back. ‘O Vais, a scheme for a scheme!’ Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream, Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam. And Rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook, And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took. Swift were the heels of his flight, and loud behind as he went Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent. And ever he thought as he ran, and caught at his gasping breath, ‘O the fool of a Rua, Rua that runs to his death! But the right is the right,’ thought Rua, and ran like the wind on the foam, ‘The right is the right for ever, and home for ever home. For what though the oven smoke? And what though I die ere morn? There was I nourished and tended, and there was Taheia born.’ Noon was high on the High-place, the second noon of the feast; And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest; And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals; And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels; And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh With bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye. As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall, The dead and the maimed are scattered, and lie, and stagger, and crawl; So on the grades of the terrace, in the ardent eye of the day, The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay; And loud as the dome of the bees, in the time of a swarming horde, A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared. Rua looked and wondered; he said to himself in his heart: ‘Poor are the pleasures of life, and death is the better part.’ But lo! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk Sat by themselves, nor raised their serious eyes, nor spoke: Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged, Gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged; And quiet amongst the quiet, and fairer than all the fair, Taheia, the well-descended, Taheia, heavy of hair. And the soul of Rua awoke, courage enlightened his eyes, And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise. Over against him at once, in the spotted shade of the trees, Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees; On the grades of the sacred terrace, the driveller woke to fear, And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering spear. And Rua folded his arms, and scorn discovered his teeth; Above the war-crowd gibbered, and Rua stood smiling beneath. Thick, like leaves in the autumn, faint, like April sleet, Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet; And Taheia leaped from her place; and the priest, the ruby-eyed, Ran to the front of the terrace, and brandished his arms, and cried: ‘Hold, O fools, he brings tidings!’ and ‘Hold, 'tis the love of my heart!’ Till lo! in front of the terrace, Rua pierced with a dart. Taheia cherished his head, and the aged priest stood by, And gazed with eyes of ruby at Rua's darkening eye. ‘Taheia, here is the end, I die a death for a man. I have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan. See them, the drooping of hams! behold me the blinking crew: Fifty spears they cast, and one of fifty true! And you, O priest, the foreteller, foretell for yourself if you can, Foretell the hour of the day when the Vais shall burst on your clan! By the head of the tapu cleft, with death and fire in their hand, Thick and silent like ants, the warriors swarm in the land.’ And they tell that when next the sun had climbed to the noonday skies It shone on the smoke of feasting in the country of the Vais. Ticonderoga A Legend of the West Highlands This is the tale of the man Who heard a word in the night In the land of the heathery hills, In the days of the feud and the fight. By the sides of the rainy sea, Where never a stranger came, On the awful lips of the dead, He heard the outlandish name. It sang in his sleeping ears, It hummed in his waking head: The name—Ticonderoga, The utterance of the dead. I. THE SAYING OF THE NAME On the loch-sides of Appin, When the mist blew from the sea, A Stewart stood with a Cameron: An angry man was he. The blood beat in his ears, The blood ran hot to his head, The mist blew from the sea, And there was the Cameron dead. ‘O, what have I done to my friend, O, what have I done to mysel', That he should be cold and dead, And I in the danger of all? Nothing but danger about me. Danger behind and before, Death at wait in the heather In Appin and Mamore, Hate at all of the ferries And death at each of the fords, Camerons priming gunlocks And Camerons sharpening swords.’ But this was a man of counsel, This was a man of a score, There dwelt no pawkier Stewart In Appin or Mamore. He looked on the blowing mist, He looked on the awful dead, And there came a smile on his face And there slipped a thought in his head. Out over cairn and moss, Out over scrog and scaur, He ran as runs the clansman That bears the cross of war. His heart beat in his body, His hair clove to his face, When he came at last in the gloaming To the dead man's brother's place. The east was white with the moon, The west with the sun was red, And there, in the house-doorway, Stood the brother of the dead. ‘I have slain a man to my danger, I have slain a man to my death. I put my soul in your hands,’ The panting Stewart saith. ‘I lay it bare in your hands, For I know your hands are leal; And be you my targe and bulwark From the bullet and the steel.’ Then up and spoke the Cameron, And gave him his hand again: ‘There shall never a man in Scotland Set faith in me in vain; And whatever man you have slaughtered, Of whatever name or line, By my sword and yonder mountain, I make your quarrel mine. I bid you in to my fireside, I share with you house and hall; It stands upon my honour To see you safe from all.’ It fell in the time of midnight, When the fox barked in the den And the plaids were over the faces In all the houses of men, That as the living Cameron Lay sleepless on his bed, Out of the night and the other world, Came in to him the dead. ‘My blood is on the heather, My bones are on the hill; There is joy in the home of ravens That the young shall eat their fill. My blood is poured in the dust, My soul is spilled in the air; And the man that has undone me Sleeps in my brother's care.’ ‘I'm wae for your death, my brother, But if all of my house were dead, I couldnae withdraw the plighted hand, Nor break the word once said.’ ‘O, what shall I say to our father, In the place to which I fare? O, what shall I say to our mother, Who greets to see me there? And to all the kindly Camerons That have lived and died long-syne— Is this the word you send them, Fause-hearted brother mine?’ ‘It's neither fear nor duty, It's neither quick nor dead Shall gar me withdraw the plighted hand, Or break the word once said.’ Thrice in the time of midnight, When the fox barked in the den, And the plaids were over the faces In all the houses of men, Thrice as the living Cameron Lay sleepless on his bed, Out of the night and the other world Came in to him the dead, And cried to him for vengeance On the man that laid him low; And thrice the living Cameron Told the dead Cameron, no. ‘Thrice have you seen me, brother, But now shall see me no more, Till you meet your angry fathers Upon the farther shore. Thrice have I spoken, and now, Before the cock be heard, I take my leave for ever With the naming of a word. It shall sing in your sleeping ears, It shall hum in your waking head, The name—Ticonderoga, And the warning of the dead.’ Now when the night was over And the time of people's fears, The Cameron walked abroad, And the word was in his ears. ‘Many a name I know, But never a name like this; O, where shall I find a skilly man Shall tell me what it is?’ With many a man he counselled Of high and low degree, With the herdsmen on the mountains And the fishers of the sea. And he came and went unweary, And read the books of yore, And the runes that were written of old On stones upon the moor. And many a name he was told, But never the name of his fears— Never, in east or west, The name that rang in his ears: Names of men and of clans; Names for the grass and the tree, For the smallest tarn in the mountains, The smallest reef in the sea: Names for the high and low, The names of the craig and the flat; But in all the land of Scotland, Never a name like that. II. THE SEEKING OF THE NAME And now there was speech in the south, And a man of the south that was wise, A periwig'd lord of London, Called on the clans to rise. And the riders rode, and the summons Came to the western shore, To the land of the sea and the heather, To Appin and Mamore. It called on all to gather From every scrog and scaur, That loved their fathers' tartan And the ancient game of war. And down the watery valley And up the windy hill, Once more, as in the olden, The pipes were sounding shrill; Again in highland sunshine The naked steel was bright; And the lads, once more in tartan, Went forth again to fight. ‘O, why should I dwell here With a weird upon my life, When the clansmen shout for battle And the war-swords clash in strife? I cannae joy at feast, I cannae sleep in bed, For the wonder of the word And the warning of the dead. It sings in my sleeping ears, It hums in my waking head, The name—Ticonderoga, The utterance of the dead. Then up, and with the fighting men To march away from here, Till the cry of the great war-pipe Shall drown it in my ear!’ Where flew King George's ensign The plaided soldiers went: They drew the sword in Germany, In Flanders pitched the tent. The bells of foreign cities Rang far across the plain: They passed the happy Rhine, They drank the rapid Main. Through Asiatic jungles The Tartans filed their way, And the neighing of the warpipes Struck terror in Cathay. ‘Many a name have I heard,’ he thought, ‘In all the tongues of men, Full many a name both here and there, Full many both now and then. When I was at home in my father's house In the land of the naked knee, Between the eagles that fly in the lift And the herrings that swim in the sea, And now that I am a captain-man With a braw cockade in my hat— Many a name have I heard,’ he thought, ‘But never a name like that.’ III. THE PLACE OF THE NAME There fell a war in a woody place, Lay far across the sea, A war of the march in the mirk midnight And the shot from behind the tree, The shaven head and the painted face, The silent foot in the wood, In a land of a strange, outlandish tongue That was hard to be understood. It fell about the gloaming The general stood with his staff, He stood and he looked east and west With little mind to laugh. ‘Far have I been and much have I seen, And kent both gain and loss, But here we have woods on every hand And a kittle water to cross. Far have I been and much have I seen, But never the beat of this; And there's one must go down to that waterside To see how deep it is.’ It fell in the dusk of the night When unco things betide, The skilly captain, the Cameron, Went down to that waterside. Canny and soft the captain went; And a man of the woody land, With the shaven head and the painted face, Went down at his right hand. It fell in the quiet night, There was never a sound to ken; But all of the woods to the right and the left Lay filled with the painted men. ‘Far have I been and much have I seen, Both as a man and boy, But never have I set forth a foot On so perilous an employ.’ It fell in the dusk of the night When unco things betide, That he was aware of a captain-man Drew near to the waterside. He was aware of his coming Down in the gloaming alone; And he looked in the face of the man And lo! the face was his own. ‘This is my weird,’ he said, ‘And now I ken the worst; For many shall fall the morn, But I shall fall with the first. O, you of the outland tongue, You of the painted face, This is the place of my death; Can you tell me the name of the place?’ ‘Since the Frenchmen have been here They have called it Sault-Marie; But that is a name for priests, And not for you and me. It went by another word,’ Quoth he of the shaven head: ‘It was called Ticonderoga In the days of the great dead.’ And it fell on the morrow's morning, In the fiercest of the fight, That the Cameron bit the dust As he foretold at night; And far from the hills of heather, Far from the isles of the sea, He sleeps in the place of the name As it was doomed to be. Heather Ale A Galloway Legend From the bonny bells of heather They brewed a drink long-syne, Was sweeter far than honey, Was stronger far than wine. They brewed it and they drank it, And lay in a blessed swound For days and days together In their dwellings underground. There rose a king in Scotland, A fell man to his foes, He smote the Picts in battle, He hunted them like roes. Over miles of the red mountain He hunted as they fled, And strewed the dwarfish bodies Of the dying and the dead. Summer came in the country, Red was the heather bell; But the manner of the brewing Was none alive to tell. In graves that were like children's On many a mountain head, The Brewsters of the Heather Lay numbered with the dead. The king in the red moorland Rode on a summer's day; And the bees hummed, and the curlews Cried beside the way. The king rode, and was angry, Black was his brow and pale, To rule in a land of heather And lack the Heather Ale. It fortuned that his vassals, Riding free on the heath, Came on a stone that was fallen And vermin hid beneath. Rudely plucked from their hiding, Never a word they spoke: A son and his aged father— Last of the dwarfish folk. The king sat high on his charger, He looked on the little men; And the dwarfish and swarthy couple Looked at the king again. Down by the shore he had them; And there on the giddy brink— ‘I will give you life, ye vermin, For the secret of the drink.’ There stood the son and father And they looked high and low; The heather was red around them, The sea rumbled below. And up and spoke the father, Shrill was his voice to hear: ‘I have a word in private, A word for the royal ear. ‘Life is dear to the aged, And honour a little thing; I would gladly sell the secret,’ Quoth the Pict to the King. His voice was small as a sparrow's, And shrill and wonderful clear: ‘I would gladly sell my secret, Only my son I fear. ‘For life is a little matter, And death is nought to the young; And I dare not sell my honour Under the eye of my son. Take him, O king, and bind him, And cast him far in the deep; And it's I will tell the secret That I have sworn to keep.’ They took the son and bound him, Neck and heels in a thong, And a lad took him and swung him, And flung him far and strong, And the sea swallowed his body, Like that of a child of ten; And there on the cliff stood the father, Last of the dwarfish men. 'True was the word I told you: Only my son I feared; For I doubt the sapling courage That goes without the beard. But now in vain is the torture, Fire shall never avail: Here dies in my bosom The secret of Heather Ale.’ Christmas at Sea The sheets were frozen hard, and they cut the naked hand; The decks were like a slide, where a seaman scarce could stand; The wind was a nor'wester, blowing squally off the sea; And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee. They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day; But 'twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay. We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout, And we gave her the maintops'l, and stood by to go about. All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and the North; All day we hauled the frozen sheets, and got no further forth; All day as cold as charity, in bitter pain and dread, For very life and nature we tacked from head to head. We gave the South a wider berth, for there the tide-race roared; But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard: So 's we saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running high, And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his eye. The frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam; The good red fires were burning bright in every 'longshore home; The windows sparkled clear, and the chimneys volleyed out; And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about. The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer; For it 's just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year) This day of our adversity was blessèd Christmas morn, And the house above the coastguard's was the house where I was born. O well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there, My mother's silver spectacles, my father's silver hair; And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves, Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves. And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me, Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea; And O the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way, To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessèd Christmas Day. They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall. ‘All hands to loose topgallant sails,’ I heard the captain call. ‘By the Lord, she'll never stand it,’ our first mate, Jackson, cried. . . .‘It's the one way or the other, Mr Jackson,’ he replied. She staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good, And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood. As the winter's day was ending, in the entry of the night, We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light. And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me, As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea; But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold, Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO ORI A ORI Ori, my brother in the island mode, In every tongue and meaning much my friend, This story of your country and your clan, In your loved house, your too much honoured guest, I made in English. Take it, being done; And let me sign it with the name you gave. Teriitera</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS OF TRAVEL I The Vagabond To an air of Schubert Give to me the life I love, Let the lave go by me, Give the jolly heaven above And the byway nigh me. Bed in the bush with stars to see, Bread I dip in the river— There's the life for a man like me, There's the life for ever. Let the blow fall soon or late, Let what will be o'er me; Give the face of earth around And the road before me. Wealth I seek not, hope nor love, Nor a friend to know me; All I seek, the heaven above And the road below me. Or let autumn fall on me Where afield I linger, Silencing the bird on tree, Biting the blue finger. White as meal the frosty field— Warm the fireside haven— Not to autumn will I yield, Not to winter even! Let the blow fall soon or late, Let what will be o'er me; Give the face of earth around, And the road before me. Wealth I ask not, hope nor love, Nor a friend to know me; All I ask the heaven above, And the road below me. II Youth and Love—I Once only by the garden gate Our lips we joined and parted. I must fulfil an empty fate And travel the uncharted. Hail and farewell! I must arise, Leave here the fatted cattle, And paint on foreign lands and skies My Odyssey of battle. The untented Kosmos my abode, I pass, a wilful stranger: My mistress still the open road And the bright eyes of danger. Come ill or well, the cross, the crown, The rainbow or the thunder, I fling my soul and body down For God to plough them under. III Youth and Love—II To the heart of youth the world is a highwayside. Passing for ever, he fares; and on either hand, Deep in the gardens golden pavilions hide, Nestle in orchard bloom, and far on the level land Call him with lighted lamp in the eventide. Thick as the stars at night when the moon is down, Pleasures assail him. He to his nobler fate Fares; and but waves a hand as he passes on, Cries but a wayside word to her at the garden gate, Sings but a boyish stave and his face is gone. IV [In dreams, unhappy, I behold you stand] In dreams, unhappy, I behold you stand As heretofore: The unremembered tokens in your hand Avail no more. No more the morning glow, no more the grace, Enshrines, endears. Cold beats the light of time upon your face And shows your tears. He came and went. Perchance you wept a while And then forgot. Ah me! but he that left you with a smile Forgets you not. V [She rested by the Broken Brook] She rested by the Broken Brook She drank of Weary Well, She moved beyond my lingering look, Ah, whither none can tell! She came, she went. In other lands, Perchance in fairer skies, Her hands shall cling with other hands, Her eyes to other eyes. She vanished. In the sounding town, Will she remember too? Will she recall the eyes of brown As I recall the blue? VI [The infinite shining heavens] The infinite shining heavens Rose and I saw in the night Uncountable angel stars Showering sorrow and light. I saw them distant as heaven, Dumb and shining and dead, And the idle stars of the night Were dearer to me than bread. Night after night in my sorrow The stars stood over the sea, Till lo! I looked in the dusk And a star had come down to me. VII Madrigal [Plain as the glistering planets shine] Plain as the glistering planets shine When winds have cleaned the skies, Her love appeared, appealed for mine And wantoned in her eyes. Clear as the shining tapers burned On Cytherea's shrine, Those brimming, lustrous beauties turned, And called and conquered mine. The beacon-lamp that Hero lit No fairer shone on sea, No plainlier summoned will and wit, Than hers encouraged me. I thrilled to feel her influence near, I struck my flag at sight. Her starry silence smote my ear Like sudden drums at night. I ran as, at the cannon's roar, The troops the ramparts man— As in the holy house of yore The willing Eli ran. Here, lady, lo! that servant stands You picked from passing men, And should you need nor heart nor hands He bows and goes again. VIII [To you, let snow and roses] To you, let snow and roses And golden locks belong: These are the world's enslavers, Let these delight the throng. But for her of duskier lustre, Whose favour still I wear, The snow be in her kirtle, The rose be in her hair! The hue of Highland rivers Careering, full and cool, From sable on to golden, From rapid on to pool— The hue of heather-honey, The hue of honey-bees, Shall tinge her golden shoulder, Shall gild her tawny knees. IX [Let Beauty awake in the morn from beautiful dreams] Let Beauty awake in the morn from beautiful dreams, Beauty awake from rest! Let Beauty awake For Beauty's sake In the hour when the birds awake in the brake And the stars are bright in the west! Let Beauty awake in the eve from the slumber of day, Awake in the crimson eve! In the day's dusk end When the shades ascend, Let her wake to the kiss of a tender friend To render again and receive! X [I know not how it is with you—] I know not how it is with you— I love the first and last, The whole field of the present view, The whole flow of the past. One little of the things that are, Nor you should change nor I— One pebble in our path—one star In all our heaven of sky. Our lives, and every day and hour, One symphony appear: One road, one garden—every flower And every bramble dear. XI [I will make you brooches and toys for your delight] I will make you brooches and toys for your delight Of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night. I will make a palace fit for you and me Of green days in forests and blue days at sea. I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep your room, Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom, And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night. And this shall be for music when no one else is near, The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear! That only I remember, that only you admire, Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire. XII We Have Loved of Yore To an air of Diabelli Berried brake and reedy island, Heaven below, and only heaven above, Through the sky's inverted azure Softly swam the boat that bore our love. Bright were your eyes as the day; Bright ran the stream, Bright hung the sky above. Days of April, airs of Eden, How the glory died through golden hours, And the shining moon arising, How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers! Bright were your eyes in the night: We have lived, my love— O, we have loved, my love. Frost has bound our flowing river, Snow has whitened all our island brake, And beside the winter faggot Joan and Darby doze and dream and wake. Still, in the river of dreams Swims the boat of love— Hark! chimes the falling oar! And again in winter evens When on firelight dreaming fancy feeds, In those ears of agèd lovers Love's own river warbles in the reeds. Love still the past, O, my love! We have lived of yore, O, we have loved of yore. XIII Ditty To an air from Bach The cock shall crow In the morning grey, The bugles blow At the break of day; The cock shall sing and the merry bugles ring, And all the little brown birds sing upon the spray. The thorn shall blow In the month of May, And my love shall go In her holiday array; But I shall lie in the kirkyard nigh While all the little brown birds sing upon the spray. XIV Mater Triumphans Son of my woman's body, you go, to the drum and fife, To taste the colour of love and the other side of life— From out of the dainty the rude, the strong from out of the frail, Eternally through the ages from the female comes the male. The ten fingers and toes, and the shell-like nail on each, The eyes blind as gems and the tongue attempting speech; Impotent hands in my bosom, and yet they shall wield the sword! Drugged with slumber and milk, you wait the day of the Lord. Infant bridegroom, uncrowned king, unanointed priest, Soldier, lover, explorer, I see you nuzzle the breast. You that grope in my bosom shall load the ladies with rings, You, that came forth through the doors, shall burst the doors of kings. XV [Bright is the ring of words] Bright is the ring of words When the right man rings them, Fair the fall of songs When the singer sings them. Still they are carolled and said— On wings they are carried— After the singer is dead And the maker buried. Low as the singer lies In the field of heather, Songs of his fashion bring The swains together. And when the west is red With the sunset embers, The lover lingers and sings And the maid remembers. XVI [In the highlands, in the country places] In the highlands, in the country places, Where the old plain men have rosy faces, And the young fair maidens Quiet eyes; Where essential silence cheers and blesses, And for ever in the hill-recesses Her more lovely music Broods and dies. O to mount again where erst I haunted; Where the old red hills are bird-enchanted, And the low green meadows Bright with sward; And when even dies, the million-tinted, And the night has come, and planets glinted, Lo, the valley hollow Lamp-bestarred! O to dream, O to awake and wander There, and with delight to take and render, Through the trance of silence, Quiet breath; Lo! for there, among the flowers and grasses, Only the mightier movement sounds and passes; Only winds and rivers, Life and death. XVII To the Tune of Wandering Willie Home no more home to me, whither must I wander? Hunger my driver, I go where I must. Cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather; Thick drives the rain, and my roof is in the dust. Loved of wise men was the shade of my roof-tree. The true word of welcome was spoken in the door— Dear days of old, with the faces in the firelight, Kind folks of old, you come again no more. Home was home then, my dear, full of kindly faces, Home was home then, my dear, happy for the child. Fire and the windows bright glittered on the moorland; Song, tuneful song, built a palace in the wild. Now, when day dawns on the brow of the moorland, Lone stands the house, and the chimney-stone is cold. Lone let it stand, now the friends are all departed, The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the place of old. Spring shall come, come again, calling up the moorfowl, Spring shall bring the sun and rain, bring the bees and flowers; Red shall the heather bloom over hill and valley, Soft flow the stream through the even-flowing hours; Fair the day shine as it shone on my childhood— Fair shine the day on the house with open door; Birds come and cry there and twitter in the chimney— But I go for ever and come again no more. XVIII Winter In rigorous hours, when down the iron lane The redbreast looks in vain For hips and haws, Lo, shining flowers upon my window-pane The silver pencil of the winter draws. When all the snowy hill And the bare woods are still; When snipes are silent in the frozen bogs, And all the garden garth is whelmed in mire, Lo, by the hearth, the laughter of the logs— More fair than roses, lo, the flowers of fire! XIX [The stormy evening closes now in vain] The stormy evening closes now in vain, Loud wails the wind and beats the driving rain, While here in sheltered house With fire-ypainted walls, I hear the wind abroad, I hark the calling squalls— ‘Blow, blow,’ I cry, ‘you burst your cheeks in vain! Blow, blow,’ I cry, ‘my love is home again!’ Yon ship you chase perchance but yesternight Bore still the precious freight of my delight, That here in sheltered house With fire-ypainted walls, Now hears the wind abroad, Now harks the calling squalls. ‘Blow, blow,’ I cry, ‘in vain you rouse the sea, My rescued sailor shares the fire with me!’ XX To Dr Hake On receiving a Copy of Verses In the belovèd hour that ushers day, In the pure dew, under the breaking grey, One bird, ere yet the woodland quires awake, With brief réveillé summons all the brake: Chirp, chirp, it goes; nor waits an answer long; And that small signal fills the grove with song. Thus on my pipe I breathed a strain or two; It scarce was music, but 'twas all I knew. It was not music, for I lacked the art, Yet what but frozen music filled my heart? Chirp, chirp, I went, nor hoped a nobler strain; But Heaven decreed I should not pipe in vain, For, lo! not far from there, in secret dale, All silent, sat an ancient nightingale. My sparrow notes he heard; thereat awoke; And with a tide of song his silence broke. XXI To Sidney Colvin I knew thee strong and quiet like the hills; I knew thee apt to pity, brave to endure, In peace or war a Roman full equipt; And just I knew thee, like the fabled kings Who by the loud sea-shore gave judgment forth, From dawn to eve, bearded and few of words. What, what, was I to honour thee? A child; A youth in ardour but a child in strength, Who after virtue's golden chariot-wheels Runs ever panting, nor attains the goal. So thought I, and was sorrowful at heart. Since then my steps have visited that flood Along whose shore the numerous footfalls cease, The voices and the tears of life expire. Thither the prints go down, the hero's way Trod large upon the sand, the trembling maid's: Nimrod that wound his trumpet in the wood, And the poor, dreaming child, hunter of flowers, That here his hunting closes with the great: So one and all go down, nor aught returns. For thee, for us, the sacred river waits, For me, the unworthy, thee, the perfect friend; There Blame desists, there his unfaltering dogs He from the chase recalls, and homeward rides; Yet Praise and Love pass over and go in. So when, beside that margin, I discard My more than mortal weakness, and with thee Through that still land unfearing I advance: If then at all we keep the touch of joy Thou shalt rejoice to find me altered—I, O Felix, to behold thee still unchanged. XXII [The morning drum-call on my eager ear] The morning drum-call on my eager ear Thrills unforgotten yet; the morning dew Lies yet undried along my field of noon. But now I pause at whiles in what I do, And count the bell, and tremble lest I hear (My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too soon. XXIII [I have trod the upward and the downward slope] I have trod the upward and the downward slope; I have endured and done in days before; I have longed for all, and bid farewell to hope; And I have lived and loved, and closed the door. XXIV [He hears with gladdened heart the thunder] He hears with gladdened heart the thunder Peal, and loves the falling dew; He knows the earth above and under— Sits and is content to view. He sits beside the dying ember, God for hope and man for friend, Content to see, glad to remember, Expectant of the certain end. XXV [Farewell, fair day and fading light!] Farewell, fair day and fading light! The clay-born here, with westward sight, Marks the huge sun now downward soar. Farewell. We twain shall meet no more. Farewell. I watch with bursting sigh My late contemned occasion die. I linger useless in my tent: Farewell, fair day, so foully spent! Farewell, fair day. If any God At all consider this poor clod, He who the fair occasion sent Prepared and placed the impediment. Let him diviner vengeance take— Give me to sleep, give me to wake Girded and shod, and bid me play The hero in the coming day! XXVI If This Were Faith God, if this were enough, That I see things bare to the buff And up to the buttocks in mire; That I ask nor hope nor hire, Nut in the husk, Nor dawn beyond the dusk, Nor life beyond death: God, if this were faith? Having felt thy wind in my face Spit sorrow and disgrace, Having seen thine evil doom In Golgotha and Khartoum, And the brutes, the work of thine hands, Fill with injustice lands And stain with blood the sea: If still in my veins the glee Of the black night and the sun And the lost battle, run: If, an adept, The iniquitous lists I still accept With joy, and joy to endure and be withstood, And still to battle and perish for a dream of good: God, if that were enough? If to feel, in the ink of the slough, And the sink of the mire, Veins of glory and fire Run through and transpierce and transpire, And a secret purpose of glory in every part, And the answering glory of battle fill my heart; To thrill with the joy of girded men To go on for ever and fail and go on again, And be mauled to the earth and arise, And contend for the shade of a word and a thing not seen with the eyes: With the half of a broken hope for a pillow at night That somehow the right is the right And the smooth shall bloom from the rough: Lord, if that were enough? XXVII My Wife Trusty, dusky, vivid, true, With eyes of gold and bramble-dew, Steel-true and blade-straight, The great artificer Made my mate. Honour, anger, valour, fire; A love that life could never tire, Death quench or evil stir, The mighty master Gave to her. Teacher, tender comrade, wife, A fellow-farer true through life, Heart-whole and soul-free The august father Gave to me. XXVIII To the Muse Resign the rhapsody, the dream, To men of larger reach; Be ours the quest of a plain theme, The piety of speech. As monkish scribes from morning break Toiled till the close of light, Nor thought a day too long to make One line or letter bright: We also with an ardent mind, Time, wealth, and fame forgot, Our glory in our patience find And skim, and skim the pot: Till last, when round the house we hear The evensong of birds, One corner of blue heaven appear In our clear well of words. Leave, leave it then, muse of my heart! Sans finish and sans frame, Leave unadorned by needless art The picture as it came. XXIX To an Island Princess Since long ago, a child at home, I read and longed to rise and roam, Where'er I went, whate'er I willed, One promised land my fancy filled. Hence the long roads my home I made; Tossed much in ships; have often laid Below the uncurtained sky my head, Rain-deluged and wind-buffeted: And many a thousand hills I crossed And corners turned—Love's labour lost, Till, Lady, to your isle of sun I came, not hoping; and, like one Snatched out of blindness, rubbed my eyes, And hailed my promised land with cries. Yes, Lady, here I was at last; Here found I all I had forecast: The long roll of the sapphire sea That keeps the land's virginity; The stalwart giants of the wood Laden with toys and flowers and food; The precious forest pouring out To compass the whole town about; The town itself with streets of lawn, Loved of the moon, blessed by the dawn, Where the brown children all the day Keep up a ceaseless noise of play, Play in the sun, play in the rain, Nor ever quarrel or complain; And late at night, in the woods of fruit, Hark! do you hear the passing flute? I threw one look to either hand, And knew I was in Fairyland. And yet one point of being so, I lacked. For, Lady (as you know), Whoever by his might of hand, Won entrance into Fairyland, Found always with admiring eyes A Fairy princess kind and wise. It was not long I waited; soon Upon my threshold, in broad noon, Gracious and helpful, wise and good, The Fairy Princess Moë stood. XXX To Kalakaua With a present of a Pearl The Silver Ship, my King—that was her name In the bright islands whence your fathers came— The Silver Ship, at rest from winds and tides, Below your palace in your harbour rides: And the seafarers, sitting safe on shore, Like eager merchants count their treasures o'er. One gift they find, one strange and lovely thing, Now doubly precious since it pleased a king. The right, my liege, is ancient as the lyre For bards to give to kings what kings admire. 'Tis mine to offer for Apollo's sake; And since the gift is fitting, yours to take. To golden hands the golden pearl I bring: The ocean jewel to the island king. XXXI To Princess Kaiulani Forth from her land to mine she goes, The island maid, the island rose, Light of heart and bright of face: The daughter of a double race. Her islands here, in Southern sun, Shall mourn their Kaiulani gone, And I, in her dear banyan shade, Look vainly for my little maid. But our Scots islands far away Shall glitter with unwonted day, And cast for once their tempests by To smile in Kaiulani's eye. XXXII To Mother Maryanne To see the infinite pity of this place, The mangled limb, the devastated face, The innocent sufferer smiling at the rod— A fool were tempted to deny his God. He sees, he shrinks. But if he gaze again, Lo, beauty springing from the breast of pain! He marks the sisters on the mournful shores; And even a fool is silent and adores. XXXIII In Memoriam E. H. I knew a silver head was bright beyond compare, I knew a queen of toil with a crown of silver hair. Garland of valour and sorrow, of beauty and renown, Life, that honours the brave, crowned her himself with the crown. The beauties of youth are frail, but this was a jewel of age. Life, that delights in the brave, gave it himself for a gage. Fair was the crown to behold, and beauty its poorest part— At once the scar of the wound and the order pinned on the heart. The beauties of man are frail, and the silver lies in the dust, And the queen that we call to mind sleeps with the brave and the just; Sleeps with the weary at length; but, honoured and ever fair, Shines in the eye of the mind the crown of the silver hair. XXXIV To My Wife A Fragment Long must elapse ere you behold again Green forest frame the entry of the lane— The wild lane with the bramble and the briar, The year-old cart-tracks perfect in the mire, The wayside smoke, perchance, the dwarfish huts, And ramblers' donkey drinking from the ruts: Long ere you trace how deviously it leads, Back from man's chimneys and the bleating meads To the woodland shadow, to the sylvan hush, When but the brooklet chuckles in the brush— Back from the sun and bustle of the vale To where the great voice of the nightingale Fills all the forest like a single room, And all the banks smell of the golden broom; So wander on until the eve descends, And back returning to your firelit friends, You see the rosy sun, despoiled of light, Hung, caught in thickets, like a schoolboy's kite. Here from the sea the unfruitful sun shall rise, Bathe the bare deck and blind the unshielded eyes; The allotted hours aloft shall wheel in vain And in the unpregrant ocean plunge again. Assault of squalls that mock the watchful guard, And pluck the bursting canvas from the yard, And senseless clamour of the calm, at night Must mar your slumbers. By the plunging light, In beetle-haunted, most unwomanly bower Of the wild-swerving cabin, hour by hour . . . XXXV To My Old Familiars Do you remember—can we e'er forget?— How, in the coiled perplexities of youth, In our wild climate, in our scowling town, We gloomed and shivered, sorrowed, sobbed and feared? The belching winter wind, the missile rain, The rare and welcome silence of the snows, The laggard morn, the haggard day, the night, The grimy spell of the nocturnal town, Do you remember?—Ah, could one forget! As when the fevered sick that all night long Listed the wind intone, and hear at last The ever-welcome voice of chanticleer Sing in the bitter hour before the dawn, With sudden ardour, these desire the day: So sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope; So we, exulting, hearkened and desired. For lo! as in the palace porch of life We huddled with chimeras, from within— How sweet to hear!—the music swelled and fell, And through the breach of the revolving doors What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled! I have since then contended and rejoiced; Amid the glories of the house of life Profoundly entered, and the shrine beheld: Yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes Shall dwindle and recede, the voice of love Fall insignificant on my closing ears, What sound shall come but the old cry of the wind In our inclement city? what return But the image of the emptiness of youth, Filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice Of discontent and rapture and despair? So, as in darkness, from the magic lamp, The momentary pictures gleam and fade And perish, and the night resurges—these Shall I remember, and then all forget. XXXVI [The tropics vanish, and meseems that I] The tropics vanish, and meseems that I, From Halkerside, from topmost Allermuir, Or steep Caerketton, dreaming gaze again. Far set in fields and woods, the town I see Spring gallant from the shallows of her smoke, Cragged, spired, and turreted, her virgin fort Beflagged. About, on seaward-drooping hills, New folds of city glitter. Last, the Forth Wheels ample waters set with sacred isles, And populous Fife smokes with a score of towns. There, on the sunny frontage of a hill, Hard by the house of kings, repose the dead, My dead, the ready and the strong of word. Their works, the salt-encrusted, still survive; The sea bombards their founded towers; the night Thrills pierced with their strong lamps. The artificers, One after one, here in this grated cell, Where the rain erases and the rust consumes, Fell upon lasting silence. Continents And continental oceans intervene; A sea uncharted, on a lampless isle, Environs and confines their wandering child In vain. The voice of generations dead Summons me, sitting distant, to arise, My numerous footsteps nimbly to retrace, And, all mutation over, stretch me down In that devoted city of the dead. XXXVII To S. C. I heard the pulse of the besieging sea Throb far away all night. I heard the wind Fly crying and convulse tumultuous palms. I rose and strolled. The isle was all bright sand, And flailing fans and shadows of the palm; The heaven all moon and wind and the blind vault; The keenest planet slain, for Venus slept. The king, my neighbour, with his host of wives, Slept in the precinct of the palisade; Where single, in the wind, under the moon, Among the slumbering cabins, blazed a fire, Sole street-lamp and the only sentinel. To other lands and nights my fancy turned— To London first, and chiefly to your house, The many-pillared and the well-beloved. There yearning fancy lighted; there again In the upper room I lay, and heard far off The unsleeping city murmur like a shell; The muffled tramp of the Museum guard Once more went by me; I beheld again Lamps vainly brighten the dispeopled street; Again I longed for the returning morn, The awaking traffic, the bestirring birds, The consentaneous trill of tiny song That weaves round monumental cornices A passing charm of beauty. Most of all, For your light foot I wearied, and your knock That was the glad réveillé of my day. Lo, now, when to your task in the great house At morning through the portico you pass, One moment glance, where by the pillared wall Far-voyaging island gods, begrimed with smoke, Sit now unworshipped, the rude monument Of faiths forgot and races undivined: Sit now disconsolate, remembering well The priest, the victim, and the songful crowd, The blaze of the blue noon, and the huge voice, Incessant, of the breakers on the shore. As far as these from their ancestral shrine, So far, so foreign, your divided friends Wander, estranged in body, not in mind. XXXVIII The House of Tembinoka ENVOI Let us, who part like brothers, part like bards; And you in your tongue and measure, I in mine, Our new division duly solemnise. Unlike the strains, and yet the theme is one: The strains unlike, and how unlike their fate! You to the blinding palace-yard shall call The prefect of the singers, and to him, Listening devout, your valedictory verse Deliver; he, his attribute fulfilled, To the island chorus hand your measures on, Wed now with harmony: so then, at last, Night after night, in the open hall of dance, Shall thirty matted men, to the clapped hand, Intone and bray and bark. Unfortunate! Paper and print alone shall honour mine. THE SONG Let now the King his ear arouse And toss the bosky ringlets from his brows, The while, our bond to implement, My muse relates and praises his descent. I Bride of the shark, her valour first I sing Who on the lone seas quickened of a King. She, from the shore and puny homes of men, Beyond the climber's sea-discerning ken, Swam, led by omens; and devoid of fear, Beheld her monstrous paramour draw near. She gazed; all round her to the heavenly pale, The simple sea was void of isle or sail— Sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared— When the deep bubbled and the brute appeared. But she, secure in the decrees of fate, Made strong her bosom and received the mate, And, men declare, from that marine embrace Conceived the virtues of a stronger race. II Her stern descendant next I praise, Survivor of a thousand frays: In the hall of tongues who ruled the throng; Led and was trusted by the strong; And when spears were in the wood, Like a tower of vantage stood: Whom, not till seventy years had sped, Unscarred of breast, erect of head, Still light of step, still bright of look, The hunter, Death, had overtook. III His sons, the brothers twain, I sing, Of whom the elder reigned a King. No Childeric he, yet much declined From his rude sire's imperious mind, Until his day came when he died, He lived, he reigned, he versified. But chiefly him I celebrate That was the pillar of the state, Ruled, wise of word and bold of mien, The peaceful and the warlike scene; And played alike the leader's part In lawful and unlawful art. His soldiers with emboldened ears Heard him laugh among the spears. He could deduce from age to age The web of island parentage; Best lay the rhyme, best lead the dance, For any festal circumstance: And fitly fashion oar and boat, A palace or an armour coat. None more availed than he to raise The strong, suffumigating blaze, Or knot the wizard leaf: none more, Upon the untrodden windward shore Of the isle, beside the beating main, To cure the sickly and constrain, With muttered words and waving rods, The gibbering and the whistling gods. But he, though thus with hand and head He ruled, commanded, charmed, and led, And thus in virtue and in might Towered to contemporary sight— Still in fraternal faith and love, Remained below to reach above, Gave and obeyed the apt command, Pilot and vassal of the land. IV My Tembinok' from men like these Inherited his palaces, His right to rule, his powers of mind, His cocoa-islands sea-enshrined. Stern bearer of the sword and whip, A master passed in mastership, He learned, without the spur of need, To write, to cipher, and to read; From all that touch on his prone shore Augments his treasury of lore, Eager in age as erst in youth To catch an art, to learn a truth, To paint on the internal page A clearer picture of the age. His age, you say? But ah, not so! In his lone isle of long ago, A royal Lady of Shalott, Sea-sundered, he beholds it not; He only hears it far away. The stress of equatorial day He suffers; he records the while The vapid annals of the isle; Slaves bring him praise of his renown, Or cackle of the palm-tree town; The rarer ship and the rare boat He marks; and only hears remote, Where thrones and fortunes rise and reel, The thunder of the turning wheel. V For the unexpected tears he shed At my departing, may his lion head Not whiten, his revolving years No fresh occasion minister of tears; At book or cards, at work or sport, Him may the breeze across the palace court For ever fan; and swelling near For ever the loud song divert his ear. XXXIX The Woodman In all the grove, nor stream nor bird Nor aught beside my blows was heard, And the woods wore their noonday dress— The glory of their silentness. From the island summit to the seas, Trees mounted, and trees drooped, and trees Groped upward in the gaps. The green Inarboured talus and ravine By fathoms. By the multitude, The rugged columns of the wood And bunches of the branches stood; Thick as a mob, deep as a sea, And silent as eternity. With lowered axe, with backward head, Late from this scene my labourer fled, And with a ravelled tale to tell, Returned. Some denizen of hell, Dead man or disinvested god, Had close behind him peered and trod, And triumphed when he turned to flee. How different fell the lines with me! Whose eye explored the dim arcade Impatient of the uncoming shade— Shy elf, or dryad pale and cold, Or mystic lingerer from of old: Vainly. The fair and stately things, Impassive as departed kings, All still in the wood's stillness stood, And dumb. The rooted multitude Nodded and brooded, bloomed and dreamed, Unmeaning, undivined. It seemed No other art, no hope, they knew, Than clutch the earth and seek the blue. Mid vegetable king and priest And stripling, I (the only beast) Was at the beast's work, killing; hewed The stubborn roots across, bestrewed The glebe with the dislustred leaves, And bade the saplings fall in sheaves; Bursting across the tangled math A ruin that I called a path, A Golgotha that, later on, When rains had watered, and suns shone, And seeds enriched the place, should bear And be called garden. Here and there, I spied and plucked by the green hair A foe more resolute to live, The toothed and killing sensitive. He, semi-conscious, fled the attack; He shrank and tucked his branches back; And straining by his anchor-strand, Captured and scratched the rooting hand. I saw him crouch, I felt him bite; And straight my eyes were touched with sight. I saw the wood for what it was: The lost and the victorious cause, The deadly battle pitched in line, Saw silent weapons cross and shine: Silent defeat, silent assault, A battle and a burial vault. Thick round me in the teeming mud Briar and fern strove to the blood: The hooked liana in his gin Noosed his reluctant neighbours in: There the green murderer throve and spread, Upon his smothering victims fed, And wantoned on his climbing coil. Contending roots fought for the soil Like frightened demons: with despair Competing branches pushed for air. Green conquerors from overhead Bestrode the bodies of their dead: The Caesars of the sylvan field, Unused to fail, foredoomed to yield: For in the groins of branches, lo! The cancers of the orchid grow. Silent as in the listed ring Two chartered wrestlers strain and cling; Dumb as by yellow Hooghly's side The suffocating captives died; So hushed the woodland warfare goes Unceasing; and the silent foes Grapple and smother, strain and clasp Without a cry, without a gasp. Here also sound thy fans, O God, Here too thy banners move abroad: Forest and city, sea and shore, And the whole earth, thy threshing-floor! The drums of war, the drums of peace, Roll through our cities without cease, And all the iron halls of life Ring with the unremitting strife. The common lot we scarce perceive. Crowds perish, we nor mark nor grieve: The bugle calls—we mourn a few! What corporal's guard at Waterloo? What scanty hundreds more or less In the man-devouring Wilderness? What handful bled on Delhi ridge? —See, rather, London, on thy bridge The pale battalions trample by, Resolved to slay, resigned to die. Count, rather, all the maimed and dead In the unbrotherly war of bread. See, rather, under sultrier skies What vegetable Londons rise, And teem, and suffer without sound: Or in your tranquil garden ground, Contented, in the falling gloom, Saunter and see the roses bloom. That these might live, what thousands died! All day the cruel hoe was plied; The ambulance barrow rolled all day; Your wife, the tender, kind, and gay, Donned her long gauntlets, caught the spud, And bathed in vegetable blood; And the long massacre now at end, See! where the lazy coils ascend, See, where the bonfire sputters red At even, for the innocent dead. Why prate of peace? when, warriors all, We clank in harness into hall, And ever bare upon the board Lies the necessary sword. In the green field or quiet street, Besieged we sleep, beleaguered eat; Labour by day and wake o' nights, In war with rival appetites. The rose on roses feeds; the lark On larks. The sedentary clerk All morning with a diligent pen Murders the babes of other men; And like the beasts of wood and park, Protects his whelps, defends his den. Unshamed the narrow aim I hold; I feed my sheep, patrol my fold; Breathe war on wolves and rival flocks, A pious outlaw on the rocks Of God and morning; and when time Shall bow, or rivals break me, climb Where no undubbed civilian dares, In my war harness, the loud stairs Of honour; and my conqueror Hail me a warrior fallen in war. XL Tropic Rain As the single pang of the blow, when the metal is mingled well, Rings and lives and resounds in all the bounds of the bell, So the thunder above spoke with a single tongue, So in the heart of the mountain the sound of it rumbled and clung. Sudden the thunder was drowned—quenched was the levin light— And the angel-spirit of rain laughed out loud in the night. Loud as the maddened river raves in the cloven glen, Angel of rain! you laughed and leaped on the roofs of men; And the sleepers sprang in their beds, and joyed and feared as you fell. You struck, and my cabin quailed; the roof of it roared like a bell, You spoke, and at once the mountain shouted and shook with brooks. You ceased, and the day returned, rosy, with virgin looks. And methought that beauty and terror are only one, not two; And the world has room for love, and death, and thunder, and dew; And all the sinews of hell slumber in summer air; And the face of God is a rock, but the face of the rock is fair. Beneficent streams of tears flow at the finger of pain; And out of the cloud that smites, beneficent rivers of rain. XLI An End of Travel Let now your soul in this substantial world Some anchor strike. Be here the body moored; This spectacle immutably from now The picture in your eye; and when time strikes, And the green scene goes on the instant blind— The ultimate helpers, where your horse today Conveyed you dreaming, bear your body dead. XLII [We uncommiserate pass into the night] We uncommiserate pass into the night From the loud banquet, and departing leave A tremor in men's memories, faint and sweet And frail as music. Features of our face, The tones of the voice, the touch of the loved hand, Perish and vanish, one by one, from earth: Meanwhile, in the hall of song, the multitude Applauds the new performer. One, perchance, One ultimate survivor lingers on, And smiles, and to his ancient heart recalls The long forgotten. Ere the morrow die, He too, returning, through the curtain comes, And the new age forgets us and goes on. XLIII The Last Sight Once more I saw him. In the lofty room, Where oft with lights and company his tongue Was trump to honest laughter, sate attired A something in his likeness. ‘Look!’ said one, Unkindly kind, ‘look up, it is your boy!’ And the dread changeling gazed on me in vain. XLIV [Sing me a song of a lad that is gone] Sing me a song of a lad that is gone, Say, could that lad be I? Merry of soul he sailed on a day Over the sea to Skye. Mull was astern, Rum on the port, Eigg on the starboard bow; Glory of youth glowed in his soul: Where is that glory now? Sing me a song of a lad that is gone, Say, could that lad be I? Merry of soul he sailed on a day Over the sea to Skye. Give me again all that was there, Give me the sun that shone! Give me the eyes, give me the soul, Give me the lad that's gone! Sing me a song of a lad that is gone, Say, could that lad be I? Merry of soul he sailed on a day Over the sea to Skye. Billow and breeze, islands and seas, Mountains of rain and sun, All that was good, all that was fair, All that was me is gone. XLV To S. R. Crockett On receiving a Dedication Blows the wind today, and the sun and the rain are flying, Blows the wind on the moors today and now, Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, My heart remembers how! Grey recumbent tombs of the dead in desert places, Standing-stones on the vacant wine-red moor, Hills of sheep, and the howes of the silent vanished races, And winds, austere and pure. Be it granted me to behold you again in dying, Hills of home! and to hear again the call; Hear about the graves of the martyrs the peewees crying, And hear no more at all. XLVI Evensong The embers of the day are red Beyond the murky hill. The kitchen smokes: the bed In the darkling house is spread: The great sky darkens overhead, And the great woods are shrill. So far have I been led, Lord, by Thy will: So far I have followed, Lord, and wondered still. The breeze from the embalmèd land Blows sudden toward the shore, And claps my cottage door. I hear the signal, Lord—I understand. The night at Thy command Comes. I will eat and sleep and will not question more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS 1880–1894 I Alcaics to H. F. Brown Brave lads in olden musical centuries Sang, night by night, adorable choruses, Sat late by ale-house doors in April Chaunting in joy as the moon was rising. Moon-seen and merry, under the trellises, Flush-faced they played with old polysyllables Spring scents inspired, old wine diluted, Love and Apollo were there to chorus. Now these, the songs, remain to eternity, Those only, those, the bountiful choristers Gone—those are gone, those unremembered Sleep and are silent in earth forever. So man himself appears and evanishes, So smiles and goes; as wanderers halting at Some green-embowered house, play their music, Play and are gone on the windy highway; Yet dwells the strain enshrined in the memory Long after they departed eternally, Forth-faring toward far mountain summits Cities of men or the sounding Ocean. Youth sang the song in years immemorial Brave chanticleer he sang and was beautiful; Bird-haunted, green tree-tops in April Heard and were pleased by the voice of singing. Youth goes and leaves behind him a prodigy— Songs sent by thee afar from Venetian Sea-grey lagunes, sea-paven highways, Dear to me here in my Alpine exile. II Tales of Arabia Yes, friend, I own these tales of Arabia Smile not, as smiled their flawless originals Age-old but yet untamed, for ages Pass and the magic is undiminished. Thus, friend, the tales of old Camaralzaman, Ayoub, the Slave of Love, or the Calendars Blind-eyed and ill-starred royal scions, Charm us in age as they charmed in childhood. Fair ones, beyond all numerability, Beam from the palace, beam on humanity, Bright-eyed, in truth, yet soulless houries Offering pleasures and only pleasure. Thus they, the venal Muses Arabian— Unlike, indeed, to nobler divinities, Greek Gods or old time-honoured muses Easily proffer unloved caresses. Lost, lost, the man who mindeth their minstrelsy; Since still, in sandy, glittering pleasances, Cold, stony fruits, gem-like but quite in- Edible, flatter and wholly starve him. III [Still I love to rhyme, and still more, rhyming, to wander] Still I love to rhyme, and still more, rhyming, to wander Far from the commoner way; Old trills and falls by the brook-side still do I ponder, Dreaming tomorrow today. Come here, come, revive me, Sun-God, teach me, Apollo, Measures descanted before; Since I ancient verses seek, I emulous follow Prints in the marble of yore. Still strange, strange, they sound in old-young raiment invested, Songs for the brain to beget— Young song birds of late in grave old temples benested Piping and chirruping yet. Thoughts? no thought has yet unskilled attempted to flutter Trammelled so vilely in verse; He who writes but aims at fame and his bread and his butter, Won with a groan and a curse. IV [Flower god, god of the spring, beautiful, bountiful] Flower god, god of the spring, beautiful, bountiful, Gold-dyed shield in the sky, lover of versicles, Here I wander in April, Cold, grey-headed; and still to my Heart, Spring comes with a bound, Spring the deliverer, Spring, song-leader in woods, chorally resonant, Spring, flower planter in meadows, Child conductor in willowy Fields deep clotted with bloom, daisies and crocuses: Here that child from his heart drinks of eternity: O child, happy are children! She still smiles on their innocence. She, dear mother in God, fostering violets, Fills earth full of her scents, voices and violins: Thus one cunning in music Wakes old chords in the memory: Thus fair earth in the Spring leads her performances. One more touch of the bow, smell of the virginal Green—one more, and my bosom Feels new life with an ecstasy. V Horace, Book II, Ode III Where the pine and the shivering poplar Love to join with their branches their shadow; Where through glimmering valleys, the water, Glass-clear, hurries in murmur, towards Ocean— Thither command them carry the wine jars— Wine jars full of the juice of Falernum— Unguents, Roses to bind in our Chaplets, Bid your slaves carry down to the margin. Now, we glory in youth and in riches: Now, the sisters are merciful toward us. Soon, our Fortune shall turn from us coldly: Soon, we leave our groves and our houses, Soon, our gardens by yellow old Tiber; While our gold that we hoarded so closely Gladly seizes the joyful successor. VI Lines for H. F. Brown Yes, I remember, and still remember wailing Wind in the clouds and rainy sea-horizon, Empty and lit with low, nocturnal glimmer, How in the strong, deep-plunging, transatlantic Emigrant ship we sang our songs in chorus. Piping, the gull flew by, the roaring billows Yawned and resounded round the mighty vessel Infinite uproar, endless contradiction; Yet over all our chorus rose reminding Wanderers here at sea of unforgotten Homes and undying, old, memorial loves. Brown in his haste demanded this from me. I in my leisure made the present verse. VII Translations from Martial EPITAPHIUM EROTII X. 61 Here lies Erotion, whom at six years old Fate pilfered. Stranger (when I too am cold Who shall succeed me in my rural field), To this small spirit annual honours yield. Bright be thy hearth, hale be thy babes, I crave, And this, in thy green farm, the only grave. V. 34 [Mother and sire, to you do I commend] Mother and sire, to you do I commend Tiny Erotion, who must now descend, A child, among the shadows, and appear Before hell's bandog and hell's gondolier. Of six hoar winters she had felt the cold, But lacked six days of being six years old. Now she must come, all playful, to that place Where the great ancients sit with reverend face; Now lisping, as she used, of whence she came, Perchance she names and stumbles at my name. O'er these so fragile bones, let there be laid A plaything for a turf; and for that maid That swam light-footed as the thistle-burr On thee. O Mother earth, be light on her. DE EROTIO PUELLA V. 37 This girl was sweeter than the song of swans, And daintier than the lamb upon the lawns Or Lucrine oyster. She, the flower of girls, Outshone the light of Erythræan pearls; The teeth of India that with polish glow, The untouched lilies or the morning snow. Her tresses did gold-dust outshine And fair hair of women of the Rhine. Compared to her the peacock seemed not fair, The squirrel lively, or the phoenix rare; Her on whose pyre the smoke still hovering waits, Her whom the greedy and unequal fates On the sixth dawning of her natal day My child-love and my playmate—snatcht away. IN MAXIMUM II. 53 Wouldst thou be free? I think it not, indeed But if thou wouldst, attend this simple rede: When quite contented thou canst dine at home And drink a small wine of the march of Rome; When thou canst see unmoved thy neighbour's plate, And wear my threadbare toga in the gate; When thou hast learned to love a small abode, And not to choose a mistress à la mode: When thus contained and bridled thou shalt be, Then, Maximus, then first shalt thou be free. DE CŒNATIONE MICÆ II. 59 Look round: You see a little supper room; But from my window, lo! great Cæsar's tomb! And the great dead themselves, with jovial breath Bid you be merry and remember death. AD OLUM II. 68 Call me not rebel, though in what I sing If I no longer hail thee Lord and King I have redeemed myself with all I had, And now possess my fortunes poor but glad. With all I had I have redeemed myself, And escaped at once from slavery and pelf. The unruly wishes must a ruler take, Our high desires do our low fortunes make: Those only who desire palatial things Do bear the fetters and the frowns of Kings; Set free thy slave; thou settest free thyself. AD QUINTILIANUM II. 90 O chief director of the growing race, Of Rome the glory and of Rome the grace, Me, O Quintilian, may you not forgive Though, far from labour, I make haste to live? Some burn to gather wealth, lay hands on rule, Or with white statues fill the atrium full. The talking hearth, the rafters swart with smoke, Live fountains and rough grass, my love invokes: A sturdy slave: a not too learned wife: Nights filled with slumber, and a quiet life. AD PISCATOREM IV. 30 For these are sacred fishes all Who know that lord who is lord of all; Come to the brim and nose the friendly hand That sways and can beshadow all the land. Nor only so, but have their names, and come When they are summoned by the Lord of Rome. Here once his line an impious Libyan threw; And as with tremulous reed his prey he drew, Straight, the light failed him. He groped, nor found the prey that he had ta'en. Now as a warning to the fisher clan Beside the lake he sits, a beggarman. Thou, then, while still thine innocence is pure, Flee swiftly, nor presume to set thy lure; Respect these fishes, for their friends are great And in the waters empty all thy bait. DE HORTIS JULII MARTIALIS IV. 64 My Martial owns a garden, famed to please, Beyond the glades of the Hesperides; Along Janiculum lies the chosen block Where the cool grottos trench the hanging rock. The moderate summit, something plain and bare, Tastes overhead of a serener air; And while the clouds besiege the vales below, Keeps the clear heaven and doth with sunshine glow. To the June stars that circle in the skies The dainty roofs of that tall villa rise. Hence do the seven imperial hills appear; And you may view the whole of Rome from here: Beyond, the Alban and the Tuscan hills; And the cool groves and the cool falling rills. Rubre Fidenæ, and with virgin blood Anointed once Perenna's orchard wood. Thence the Flaminian, the Salarian way, Stretch far abroad below the dome of day; And lo! the traveller toiling toward his home; And all unheard, the chariot speeds to Rome! For here no whisper of the wheels; and tho' The Mulvian Bridge, above the Tiber's flow, Hangs all in sight, and down the sacred stream The sliding barges vanish like a dream, The seaman's shrilling pipe not enters here, Nor the rude cries of porters on the pier. And if so rare the house, how rarer far The welcome and the weal that therein are! So free the access, the doors so widely thrown You half imagine all to be your own. AD MARTIALEM V. 20 God knows, my Martial, if we two could be To enjoy our days set wholly free; To the true life together bend our mind, And take a furlough from the falser kind, No rich saloon, nor palace of the great, Nor suit at law should trouble our estate; On no vainglorious statues should we look, But of a walk, a talk, a little book, Baths, wells, and meads and the verandah shade, Let all our travels and our toils be made. Now neither lives unto himself, alas! And the good suns we see, that flash and pass And perish; and the bell that knells them cries, ‘Another gone: O when will ye arise?’ AN IMITATION, PINDARIS CAUSA VI. 16 Lo, in thy green enclosure here, Let not the ugly or the old appear, Divine Priapus; but with leaping tread The schoolboy, and the golden head Of the slim filly twelve years old— Let these to enter and to steal be bold! AD NEPOTEM VI. 27 O Nepos, twice my neighbour (since at home We're door by door by Flora's temple dome, And in the country, still conjoined by fate, Behold our villas, standing gate by gate!) Thou hast a daughter, dearer far than life, Thy image and the image of thy wife; But why for her neglect the flowing can And lose the prime of thy Falernian? Hoard casks of money, if to hoard be thine; But let the daughter drink a younger wine! Let her go rich and wise, in silk and fur; Lay down a bin that shall grow old with her; But thou, meantime, the while the batch is sound, With pleased companions pass the bowl around: Nor let the childless only taste delights, For Fathers also may enjoy their nights. DE M. ANTONIO X. 23 Now Antonius, in a smiling age, Counts of his life the fifteenth finished stage. The rounded days and the safe years he sees Nor fears death's water mounting round his knees, To him remembering not one day is sad, Not one but that its memory makes him glad. So good men lengthen life; and to recall The past, is to have twice enjoyed it all. IN LUPUM XI. 18 Beyond the gates, you gave a farm to till: I have a larger on my window-sill! A farm, d'ye say? Is this a farm to you?— Where for all woods I spy one tuft of rue, And that so rusty, and so small a thing, One shrill cicada hides it with a wing; Where one cucumber covers all the plain; And where one serpent rings himself in vain To enter wholly; and a single snail Eats all, and exit fasting—to the jail. Here shall I wait in vain till figs be set, Or till the spring disclose the violet. Through all my wilds a tameless mouse careers, And in that narrow boundary appears, Huge as the stalking lion of Algiers, Huge as the fabled boar of Calydon. And all my hay is at one swoop impresst. By one low-flying swallow for her nest. Strip god Priapus of each attribute Here finds he scarce a pedestal to foot. The gathered harvest scarcely brims a spoon; And all my vintage drips in a cocoon. Generous are you, but I more generous still: Take back your farm and hand me half a gill! IN CHARIDEMUM XI. 39 You, Charidemus, who my cradle swung And watched me all the days that I was young— You, at whose steps the laziest slaves awake And both the bailiff and the butler quake— The barber's suds now blacken with my beard And my rough kisses make the maids afeard: Still, in your eyes, before your judgement seat, I am the baby that you used to beat. You must do all things, unreproved; but I If once to play or to my love I fly, Big with reproach, I see your eyebrows twitch, And for the accustomed cane your fingers itch. If something daintily attired I go, Straight you exclaim: ‘Your father did not so!’ And, frowning, count the bottles on the board, As though my cellar were your private hoard. Enough, at last! I have borne all I can, And your own mistress hails me for a man. DE LIGURRA XII. 61 You fear, Ligurra—above all, you long— That I should smite you with a stinging song, This dreadful honour you both fear and hope: Both quite in vain: you fall below my scope. The Libyan lion tears the roaring bull, He does not harm the midge along the pool. But if so close this stands in your regard, From some blind tap fish forth a drunken bard, Who shall, with charcoal, on the privy wall, Immortalise your name for once and all. VIII [As in their flight the birds of song] As in their flight the birds of song Halt here and there in sweet and sunny dales But halt not overlong; The time one rural song to sing They pause; then following bounteous gales Steer forward on the wing: Sun-servers they, from first to last, Upon the sun they await To ride the sailing blast. So he a while in our contested state, A while abode, not longer—for his Sun— Mother we say, no tenderer name we know— With whose diviner glow His early days had shone, Now to withdraw her radiance had begun. Or lest a wrong I say, not she withdrew, But the loud stream of men day after day And great dust columns of the common way Between them grew and grew: And he and she for evermore might yearn, But to the spring the rivulets not return Nor to the bosom comes the child again. And he (O may we fancy so!), He, feeling time for ever flow And flowing bear him forth and far away From that dear ingle where his life began And all his treasure lay— He, waxing into man, And ever farther, ever closer wound In this obstreperous world's ignoble round From that poor prospect turned his face away. IX To Mrs MacMorland Im Schnee der Alpen—so it runs To those divine accords—and here We dwell in Alpine snows and suns A motley crew, for half the year: A motley crew we dwell, to taste— A shivering band in hope and fear— That sun upon the snowy waste, That Alpine ether cold and clear. Up from the laboured plain, and up From low sea-levels, we arise To drink of that diviner cup, The rarer air, the clearer skies; Far, as the great, old, godly King From mankind's turbid valley cries, So all we mountain-lovers sing: I to the hills will lift mine eyes! The bells that ring, the peaks that climb, The frozen snow's unbroken curd, Might well revindicate in rhyme The pauseless stream, the absent bird: In vain—for to the deeps of life You, lady, you, my heart have stirred; And since you say you love my wife, Be sure I love you for the word. Of kindness, here, I nothing say— Such loveless kindnesses there are In that grimacing, common way, That old, unhonoured social war: Love but my dog and love my love Adore with me a common star— I value not the rest above The ashes of a bad cigar. X [Come, my beloved, hear from me] Come, my beloved, hear from me Tales of the woods or open sea. Let our aspiring fancy rise A wren's flight higher toward the skies; Or far from cities, brown and bare, Play at the least in open air. In all the tales we hear or tell Still let the unfathomed ocean swell, Or shallower forest sound abroad Below the lonely stars of God; In all, let something still be done, Still in a corner shine the sun, Slim-ankled maids be fleet of foot Nor man disown the rural flute. Still let the hero from the start In honest sweat and beats of heart Push on along the untrodden road For some inviolate abode. Still, O beloved, let me hear The great bell beating far and near— The odd, unknown, enchanted gong That on the road hales men along, That from the mountain calls afar, That lures the vessel from a star, And with a still, aërial sound Makes all the earth enchanted ground. Love and the love of life and act Dance, live and sing through all our favoured tract; Till the great God enamoured gives, To him who reads, to him who lives, That rare and fair romantic strain That whoso hears must hear again. XI [Since years ago for evermore] Since years ago for evermore My cedar ship I drew to shore; And to the road and river-bed And the green, nodding reeds, I said Mine ignorant and last farewell: Now with content at home I dwell, And now divide my sluggish life Betwixt my verses and my wife: In vain: for when the lamp is lit And by the laughing fire I sit, Still with the tattered atlas spread Interminable roads I tread. XII [Far over seas an island is] Far over seas an island is Whereon when day is done A grove of tossing palms Are printed on the sun. And all about the reefy shore Blue breakers flash and fall. There shall I go, methinks, When I am done with all. Have I no castle then in Spain, No island of the mind, Where I can turn and go again When life shall prove unkind. Up, sluggard soul! and far from here Our mountain forest seek; Or nigh the enchanted island, steer Down the desirèd creek. XIII [If I could arise and travel away] If I could arise and travel away Over the plains of the night and the day, I should arrive at a land at last Where all of our sins and sorrows are past And we're done with the ten commandments. The name of the land I must not tell; Green is the grass and cool the well; Virtue is easy to find and to keep, And the sinner may lie at his pleasure and sleep By the side of the ten commandments. Income and honour, and glory and gold Grow on the bushes all over the wold; And if ever a man has a touch of remorse, He eats of the flower of the golden gorse, And to hell with the ten commandments. He goes to church in his Sunday's best; He eats and drinks with perfect zest; And whether he lives in heaven or hell Is more than you or I can tell; But he's done with the ten commandments. XIV [Now bare to the beholder's eye] Now bare to the beholder's eye, Your late denuded lendings lie, Subsiding slowly where they fell, A disinvested citadel; The obdurate corset, cupid's foe, The Dutchman's breeches frilled below. Hose that the lover loves to note, And white and crackling petticoat. From these, that on the ground repose, Their lady lately re-arose; And laying by the lady's name A living woman re-became. Of her, that from the public eye They do inclose and fortify, Now, lying scattered as they fell An indiscreeter tale they tell: Of that more soft and secret her Whose daylong fortresses they were, By fading warmth, by lingering print, These now discarded scabbards hint. A twofold change the ladies know. First, in the morn the bugles blow, And they, with floral hues and scents, Man their be-ribboned battlements. But let the stars appear, and they Shed inhumanities away; And from the changeling fashion sees, Through comic and through sweet degrees, In nature's toilet unsurpassed, Forth leaps the laughing girl at last. XV [Men are Heaven's piers; they evermore] Men are Heaven's piers; they evermore Unwearying bear the skyey floor; Man's theatre they bear with ease, Unfrowning caryatides! I, for my wife, the sun uphold Or, dozing, strike the seasons cold. She, on her side, in fairy-wise Deals in diviner mysteries, By spells to make the fuel burn And keep the parlour warm, to turn Water to wine and stones to bread By her unconquered hero-head. Sequestered in the seas of life, A Crusoe couple, man and wife, With all our good, with all our ill, Our unfrequented isle we fill; And victor in day's petty wars, Each for the other lights the stars. Come then, my Eve, and to and fro Let us about our garden go; And grateful-hearted, hand in hand, Revisit all our tillage land And marvel at our strange estate. For hooded ruin at the gate Sits watchful, and the angels fear To see us tread so boldly here. Meanwhile, my Eve, with flowers and grass, Our perishable days we pass: Far more the thorn observe—and see How our enormous sins go free— Nor less admire, beside the rose, How far a little virtue goes. XVI [Fixed is the doom; and to the last of years] Fixed is the doom; and to the last of years Teacher and taught, friend, lover, parent, child, Each walks, though near, yet separate; each beholds His dear ones shine beyond him like the stars. We also, love, for ever dwell apart; With cries approach, with cries behold the gulph, The Unvaulted: as two great eagles that do wheel in air Above a mountain, and with screams confer, Far heard athwart the cedars. Yet the years Shall bring us ever nearer; day by day Endearing, week by week; till death at last Dissolve that long divorce. By faith we love, Not knowledge; and by faith though far removed Dwell as in perfect nearness, heart to heart. We but excuse Those things we merely are; and to our souls A brave deception cherish. So from unhappy war a man returns Unfearing, or the seaman from the deep; So from cool night and woodlands, to a feast May some one enter, and still breathe of dews, And in her eyes still wear the dusky night. XVII [So live, so love, so use that fragile hour] So live, so love, so use that fragile hour, That when the dark hand of the shining power Shall one from other, wife or husband, take, The poor survivor may not weep and wake. XVIII To Mrs E. F. Strickland The freedom and the joy of days When health was with us still, The pleasure of green woods and ways And of the breathing hill: These that so dear a value set Upon the times of yore, We may remember, may forget— We must enjoy no more. As in strange lands, when exiles meet And dream of long ago, They with a nearer kindness greet The sharers of their woe: So, all unknown, from far away, I, lady, turn to you— Your fellow exile from the day, The breezes and the dew. XIX For Richmond's Garden Wall When Thomas set this tablet here, Time laughed at the vain chanticleer; And ere the moss had dimmed the stone, Time had defaced that garrison. Now I in turn keep watch and ward In my red house, in my walled yard Of sunflowers, sitting here at ease With friends and my bright canvasses. But hark, and you may hear quite plain Time's chuckled laughter in the lane. XX To Frederick Locker Not roses to the rose, I trow, The thistle sends, nor to the bee Do wasps bring honey. Wherefore now Should Locker ask a verse from me? Martial, perchance—but he is dead, And Herrick now must rhyme no more; Still burning with the muse, they tread (And arm in arm) the shadowy shore. They, if they lived, with dainty hand, To music as of mountain brooks, Might bring you worthy words to stand Unshamed, dear Locker, in your books. But tho' these fathers of your race Be gone before, yourself a sire, Today you see before your face Your stalwart youngsters touch the lyre. On these—on Lang, or Dobson—call, Long leaders of the songful feast. They lend a verse your laughing fall— A verse they owe you at the least. XXI To Master Andrew Lang On his re-editing of ‘Cupid and Psyche’ You, that are much a fisher in the pool Of things forgotten, and from thence bring up Gold of old song, and diamonds of dead speech, The scholar, and the angler, and the friend Of the pale past, this unremembered tale Restore, and this dead author re-inspire; And lo, Oblivion the iniquitous Remembers, and the stone is rolled away. And he, the long asleep, sees once again The busy bookshop, once again is read. Brave as at first, in his new garb of print, Shines forth the Elizabethan. But when Death, The unforgettable shepherd, shall have come And numbered us with these, the numberless, The inheritors of slumber and neglect— O correspondent of the immortal dead, Shall any pious hand re-edit us? XXII [Fair Isle at Sea—thy lovely name] Fair Isle at Sea—thy lovely name Soft in my ear like music came. That sea I loved, and once or twice I touched at isles of Paradise. XXIII The Family I MOTHER AND DAUGHTER High as my heart!—the quip be mine That draws their stature to a line, My pair of fairies plump and dark, The dryads of my cattle park. Here by my window close I sit, And watch (and my heart laughs at it) How these my dragon-lilies are Alike and yet dissimilar. From European womankind They are divided and defined By the free limb and the plain mind, The nobler gait, the naked foot, The indiscreeter petticoat; And show, by each endearing cause, More like what Eve in Eden was— Buxom and free, flowing and fine, In every limb, in every line, Inimitably feminine. Like ripe fruit on the espaliers Their sun-bepainted hue appears, And the white lace (when lace they wear) Shows on their golden breast more fair. So far the same they seem, and yet One apes the shrew, one the coquette— A sybil or a truant child. One runs, with a crop-halo, wild; And one, more sedulous to please, Her long dark hair, deep as her knees And thrid with living silver, sees. What need have I of wealth or fame, A club, an often-printed name? It more contents my heart to know Them going simply to and fro: To see the dear pair pause and pass Girded, among the drenching grass, In the resplendent sun; or hear, When the huge moon delays to appear, Their kindred voices sounding near In the verandah twilight. So Sound ever; so, for ever go And come upon your small brown feet: Twin honours to my country seat And its too happy master lent: My solace and its ornament! II THE DAUGHTER, TEUILA, NATIVE NAME FOR ADORNER Man, child or woman, none from her, The insatiable embellisher, Escapes! She leaves, where'er she goes, A wreath, a ribbon, or a rose: A bow or else a button changed, Two hairs coquettishly deranged, Some vital trifle takes the eye And shows the adorner has been by. Is fortune more obdurate grown? And does she leave my dear alone With none to adorn, none to caress? Straight on her proper loveliness She broods and lingers, cuts and carves With combs and brushes, rings and scarves. The treasure of her hair she takes; Therewith a new presentment makes. Babe, Goddess, Naïad of the grot, And weeps if any like it not! Her absent, she shall still be found, A posse of native maids around Her and her whirring instrument Collected and on learning bent. Oft clustered by her tender knees (Smiling himself) the gazer sees, Compact as flowers in garden beds, The smiling faces and shaved heads Of the brown island babes: with whom She exults to decorate her room, To draw them, cheer them when they cry, And still to pet and prettify. Or see, as in a looking-glass Her graceful, dimpled person pass, Nought great therein but eyes and hair, On her true business here and there; Her huge, half-naked Staff, intent, See her review and regiment, An ant with elephants, and how A smiling mouth, a clouded brow, Satire and turmoil, quips and tears, She deals among her grenadiers! Her pantry and her kitchen squad, Six-footers all, hang on her nod, Incline to her their martial chests, With school-boy laughter hail her jests, And do her in her kilted dress Obsequious obeisances. But rather to behold her when She plies for me the unresting pen! And while her crimson blood peeps out Hints a suggestion, halts a doubt— Laughs at a jest; or with a shy Glance of a parti-coloured eye Half brown, half gold, approves, delights And warms the slave for whom she writes! So dear, may you be never done Your pretty, busy round to run. And show, with changing frocks and scents, Your ever-varying lineaments, Your saucy step, your languid grace, Your sullen and your smiling face, Sound sense, true valour, baby fears, And bright unreasonable tears: The Hebe of our ageing tribe: Matron and child, my friend and scribe! III About my fields, in the broad sun And blaze of noon, there goeth one, Barefoot and robed in blue, to scan With the hard eye of the husbandman My harvests and my cattle. Her, When even puts the birds astir And day has set in the great woods, We seek, among her garden roods, With bells and cries in vain: the while Lamps, plate, and the decanter smile On the forgotten board. But she, Deaf, blind, and prone on face and knee, Forgets time, family and feast And digs like a demented beast. IV Tall as a guardsman, pale as the east at dawn, Who strides in strange apparel on the lawn? Rails for his breakfast? routs his vassals out (Like boys escaped from school) with song and shout? Kind and unkind, his Maker's final freak, Part we deride the child, part deride the antique! See where his gang, like frogs, among the dew Crouch at their duty, an unquiet crew; Adjust their staring kilts; and their swift eyes Turn still to him who sits to supervise. He in the midst, perched on a fallen tree Eyes them at labour; and, guitar on knee, Now ministers alarm, now scatters joy, Now twangs a halting chord—now tweaks a boy. Thorough in all, my resolute vizier, Plays both the despot and the volunteer, Exacts with fines obedience to my laws, —And for his music, too, exacts applause. V What glory for a boy of ten, Who now must three gigantic men, And two enormous, dapple grey New Zealand pack-horses, array And lead, and wisely resolute Our day-long business execute In the far shore-side town. His soul Glows in his bosom like a coal; His innocent eyes glitter again, And his hand trembles on the rein. Once he reviews his whole command And chivalrously planting hand On hip—a borrowed attitude— Rides off downhill into the wood. VI The old lady (so they say) but I Admire your young vitality. Still brisk of foot, still busy and keen In and about and up and down. I hear you pass with bustling feet The long verandahs round, and beat Your bell, and ‘Lotu! Lotu!’ cry; Thus calling our queer company In morning or in evening dim, To prayers and the oft mangled hymn. All day you watch across the sky The silent, shining cloudlands ply, That, huge as countries, swift as birds, Beshade the isles by halves and thirds; Till each with battlemented crest Stands anchored in the ensanguined west, An Alp enchanted. All the day You hear the exuberant wind at play, In vast, unbroken voice uplift In roaring tree, round whistling clift. VII I meanwhile in the populous house apart Sit, snugly chambered, and my silent art Uninterrupted, unremitting ply Before the dawn, by morning lamplight, by The glow of smelting noon, and when the sun Dips past my westering hill and day is done; So, bending still over my trade of words, I hear the morning and the evening birds, The morning and the evening stars behold; So there apart I sit as once of old Napier in wizard Merchiston; and my Brown innocent aides in home and husbandry, Wonder askance, What ails the boss? they ask, Him, richest of the rich, an endless task Before the earliest birds or servants stir Calls and detains him daylong prisoner? He, whose innumerable dollars hewed This cleft in the boar- and devil-haunted wood, And bade therein, far seen to seas and skies, His many-windowed, painted palace rise Red-roofed, blue-walled, a rainbow on the hill, A wonder in the forest glade: he still Unthinkable Aladdin, dawn and dark, Scribbles and scribbles, like a German clerk. We see the fact, but tell, O tell us why? My reverend washman and wise butler cry. And from their lips the unanswered questions drop. How can he live that does not keep a shop? And why does he, being acclaimed so rich, Not dwell with other gentry on the beach? But harbour, impiously brave, In the cold, uncanny wood, haunt of the fleeing slave? The sun and the loud rain here alternate: Here, in the unfathomable bush, the great Voice of the wind makes a magnanimous sound. Here, too, no doubt, the shouting doves abound To be a dainty; here in the twilight stream That brawls adown the forest, frequent gleam The jewel-eyes of crawfish. These be good: Grant them! and can the thing be understood? That this white chief, whom no distress compels, Far from all compeers in the mountain dwells? And finds a manner of living to his wish Apart from high society and sea fish? Meanwhile at times the manifold Imperishable perfumes of the past And coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast And I remember the white rime, the loud Lamplitten city, shops and the changing crowd And I remember home and the old time, The winding river, the white morning rime, The autumn robin by the riverside, That pipes in the grey eve. VIII These rings, O my beloved pair, For me on your brown fingers wear: Each, a perpetual caress To tell you of my tenderness. Let—when at morning as ye rise The golden topaz takes your eyes— To each her emblem whisper sure Love was awake an hour before. Ah yes! an hour before ye woke Low to my heart my emblem spoke, And grave, as to renew an oath, It I have kissed and blessed you both. XXIV [Light foot and tight foot] Light foot and tight foot And green grass spread, Early in the morning— But hope is on ahead. Stout foot and proud foot And gray dust spread, Early in the evening— And hope lies dead. Long life and short life, The last word said, Early in the evening There lies the bed. Brief day and bright day And sunset red, Early in the evening The stars are overhead. XXV To the Stormy Petrel To my Wife, on her Birthday Ever perilous And precious, like an ember from the fire Or gem from a volcano, we today When the drums of war reverberate in the land And every face is for the battle blacked— No less the sky, that over sodden woods Menaces now in the disconsolate calm The hurly-burly of the hurricane, Do now most fitly celebrate your day. Yet amid turmoil keep for me, my dear, The kind domestic faggot. Let the hearth Shine ever as (I praise my honest gods) In peace and tempest it has ever shone. XXVI [I, whom Apollo sometime visited] I, whom Apollo sometime visited, Or feigned to visit, now, my day being done, Do slumber wholly; nor shall know at all The weariness of changes, nor perceive Immeasurable sands of centuries Drink up the blanching ink, or the loud sound Of generations beat the music down. XXVII [As with heaped bees at hiving time] As with heaped bees at hiving time The boughs are clotted, as (ere prime) Heaven swarms with stars, or the city street Pullulates with faring feet; So swarmed my senses once; that now Repose behind my tranquil brow, Unsealed, asleep, quiescent, clear; Now only the vast shapes I hear Hear—and my hearing slowly fills— Rivers and winds among the twisting hills, And hearken—and my face is lit— Life facing; death pursuing it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATIONS AND POEMS FROM BOOKS I To the Hesitating Purchaser From ‘Treasure Island’ If sailor tales to sailor tunes, Storm and adventure, heat and cold, If schooners, islands, and maroons And Buccaneers and buried Gold, And all the old romance, retold Exactly in the ancient way, Can please, as me they pleased of old, The wiser youngsters of today: So be it, and fall on! If not, If studious youth no longer crave, His ancient appetites forgot, Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, Or Cooper of the wood and wave: So be it, also! And may I And all my pirates share the grave Where these and their creations lie! II Pirate Ditty From ‘Treasure Island’ Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest— Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest— Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! III The Song of the Sword of Alan From ‘Kidnapped’ This is the song of the sword of Alan: The smith made it, The fire set it; Now it shines in the hand of Alan Breck. Their eyes were many and bright, Swift were they to behold, Many the hands they guided: The sword was alone. The dun deer troop over the hill, They are many, the hill is one: The dun deer vanish, The hill remains. Come to me from the hills of heather, Come from the isles of the sea. O far-beholding eagles, Here is your meat. IV To Virgil and Dora Williams With a copy of ‘The Silverado Squatters’ Here, from the forelands of the tideless sea, Behold and take my offering unadorned. In the Pacific air it sprang; it grew Among the silence of the Alpine air; In Scottish heather blossomed; and at last By that unshapen sapphire, in whose face Spain, Italy, France, Algiers, and Tunis view Their introverted mountains, came to fruit. Back now, my Booklet! on the diving ship, And posting on the rails, to home return— Home, and the friends whose honouring name you bear. V To Nelly Sanchez With a copy of ‘Prince Otto’ Go, little book—the ancient phrase And still the daintiest—go your ways, My Otto, over sea and land, Till you shall come to Nelly's hand. How shall I your Nelly know? By her blue eye and her black brow, By her fierce and slender look, And by her goodness, little book! What shall I say when I come there? You shall speak her soft and fair: See—you shall say—the love they send To greet their unforgotten friend! Giant Adulpho you shall sing The next, and then the cradled king: And the four corners of the roof Then kindly bless; and to your perch aloof, Where Balzac all in yellow dressed And the dear Webster of the west Encircle the prepotent throne Of Shakespeare and of Calderon, Shall climb an upstart. There, with these, You shall give ear to breaking seas And windmills turning in the breeze, A distant undetermined din Without; and you shall hear within The blazing and the bickering logs, The crowing child, the yawning dogs, And ever agile, high and low, Our Nelly going to and fro. There shall you all silent sit, Till, when perchance the lamp is lit And the day's labour done, she takes Poor Otto down, and, warming for our sakes, Perchance beholds, alive and near, Our distant faces reappear. VI To H. C. Bunner With a copy of ‘A Child's Garden of Verses’ You know the way to Arcady Where I was born; You have been there, and fain Would there return. Some that go thither bring with them Red rose or jewelled diadem As secrets of the secret king: I, only what a child would bring. Yet I do think my song is true; For this is how the children do; This is the tune to which they go In sunny pastures high and low; The treble pipes not otherwise Sing daily under sunny skies In Arcady the dear; And you who have been there before, And love that country evermore, May not disdain to hear. VII To Katharine de Mattos With a copy of ‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ Bells upon the city are ringing in the night; High above the gardens are the houses full of light; On the heathy Pentlands is the curlew flying free, And the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie. It's ill to break the bonds that God decreed to bind, Still we'll be the children of the heather and the wind. Far away from home, O, it's still for you and me That the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie! VIII To My Wife Found in the Manuscript of ‘Weir of Hermiston’ I saw rain falling and the rainbow drawn On Lammermuir. Hearkening I heard again In my precipitous city beaten bells Winnow the keen sea wind. And here afar, Intent on my own race and place, I wrote. Take thou the writing: thine it is. For who Burnished the sword, blew on the drowsy coal, Held still the target higher, chary of praise And prodigal of censure—who but thou? So now, in the end, if this the least be good, If any deed be done, if any fire Burn in the imperfect page, the praise be thine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIGHT VERSE I [For laughing I very much vote] For laughing I very much vote give a dog a bad name and hang him Yet was never opposed to the church, So why do grave people agree, To leave me alone in the lurch. From my birth a desirable youth In amenity ever I shone Yet no merry andrew was I To be carelessly flouted upon. High, angry and sour are the words With which I have ever been curst, And yet though impenitent now I was easily led at the first. II [Here he comes, big with Statistics] Here he comes, big with Statistics, Troubled and sharp about fac's. He has heaps of the Form that is thinkable— The stuff that is feeling, he lacks. Do you envy this whiskered absurdity, With pince-nez and clerical tie? Poor fellow, he's blind of a sympathy! I'd rather be blind of an eye. III To Charles Baxter Blame me not that this epistle Is the first you have from me. Idleness has held me fettered, But at last the times are bettered And once more I wet my whistle Here in France, beside the sea. All the green and idle weather I have had in sun and shower Such an easy warm subsistence, Such an indolent existence I should find it hard to sever Day from day and hour from hour. Many a tract-provided ranter May upbraid me, dark and sour, Many a bland Utilitarian Or excited Millenarian, —‘Pereunt et imputantur You must speak to every hour.’ But the very term's deceptive, You, at least, my friend, will see, That in sunny grassy meadows Trailed across by moving shadows To be actively receptive Is as much as man can be. He that all the winter grapples Difficulties, thrust and ward— Needs to cheer him thro' his duty Memories of sun and beauty, Orchards with the russet apples Lying scattered on the sward. Many such I keep in prison, Keep them here at heart unseen, Till my muse again rehearses Long years hence, and in my verses You shall meet them re-arisen Ever comely, ever green. You know how they never perish, How, in time of later art, Memories consecrate and sweeten These defaced and tempest-beaten Flowers of former years we cherish, Half a life, against our heart. Most, those love-fruits withered greenly, Those frail, sickly amourettes, How they brighten with the distance Take new strength and new existence Till we see them sitting queenly Crowned and courted by regrets! All that loveliest and best is, Aureole-fashion round their heads, They that looked in life but plainly, How they stir our spirits vainly When they come to us Alcestis— Like, returning from the dead! Not the old love but another, Bright she comes at Memory's call Our forgotten vows reviving To a newer, livelier living, As the dead child to the mother Seems the fairest child of all. Thus our Goethe, sacred master, Travelling backward thro' his youth, Surely wandered wrong in trying To renew the old, undying Loves that cling in memory faster Than they ever lived in truth. IV Ne Sit Ancillae Tibi Amor Pudori There's just a twinkle in your eye That seems to say I might, if I Were only bold enough to try An arm about your waist. I hear, too, as you come and go, That pretty nervous laugh, you know; And then your cap is always so Coquettishly displaced. Your cap! the word's profanely said, That little topknot, white and red, That quaintly crowns your graceful head, No bigger than a flower, You set with such a witching art, And so provocatively smart, I'd like to wear it on my heart, An order for an hour! O graceful housemaid, tall and fair, I love your shy imperial air, And always loiter on the stair, When you are going by. A strict reserve the fates demand; But, when to let you pass I stand, Sometimes by chance I touch your hand And sometimes catch your eye. V Poem for a Class Re-union Whether we like it, or don't, There's a sort of a bond in the fact That we all by one master were taught, By one master were bullied and whackt. And now all the more, when we see Our class in so shrunken a state And we, who were seventy-two, Diminished to seven or eight. One has been married; and one Has taken to letters for bread, Several are over the seas; And some I imagine are dead. And that is the reason, you see, Why, as I have the honour to state, We, who were seventy-two, Are now only seven or eight. One took to heretical views, And one, they inform me, to drink; Some construct fortunes in trade, Some starve in professions, I think. But one way or other alas! Through the culpable action of Fate We, who were seventy-two, Are now shrunken to seven or eight. So, whether we like it or not, Let us own there's a bond in the past, And, since we were playmates at school, Continue good friends to the last. The roll-book is closed in the room, The clacken is gone with the slate, We, who were seventy-two, Are now only seven or eight. We shall never, our books on our back, Trudge off in the morning again, To the slide at the Janitor's door, By the ambush of cads in the lane! We shall never be sent for the tawse, Nor lose places for coming too late; We shall never be seventy-two, Who now are but seven or eight! We shall never have peeries for luck, We shall never be strapped by Maclean, We shall never take Lothian down, Nor ever be schoolboys again. But still for the sake of the past, For the love of the days of lang syne The remnant of seventy-two Shall rally together to dine. VI Browning Browning makes the verses: Your servant the critique. Browning wouldn't sing at all: I fancy I could speak. Although the book was clever (To give the Deil his due) I wasn't pleased with Browning Nor he with my review. VII On an Inland Voyage Who would think, herein to look, That from these exiguous bounds, I have dug a printed book And a cheque for twenty pounds? Thus do those who trust the Lord Go rejoicing on their way And receive a great reward For having been so kind as lay. Had the fun of the voyage Had the sport of the boats Who could have hoped in addition The pleasure of fing'ring the notes? Yes, sir, I wrote the book; I own the fact It was, perhaps, sir, an unworthy act. Have you perused it, sir?—You have?—indeed Then between you and me there no debate is. I did a silly act, but I was fee'd; You did a sillier, and you did it gratis! VIII Dedication To her, for I must still regard her As feminine in her degree, Who has been my unkind bombarder Year after year, in grief and glee, Year after year, with oaken tree; And yet between whiles my laudator In terms astonishing to me: To the Right Reverend the spectator I here, a humble dedicator, Bring the last apples from my tree. In tones of love, in tones of warning She hailed me through my brief career; And kiss and buffet, night and morning, Told me my grandmamma was near; Whether she praised me high and clear Through her unrivalled circulation, Or, sanctimonious insincere She damned me with a misquotation— A chequered but a sweet relation, Say, was it not, my granny dear? Believe me, granny, altogether Yours, though perhaps to your surprise. Oft have you spruced my wounded feather, Oft brought a light into my eyes— For notice still the writer cries. In any civil age or nation, The book that is not talked of dies. So that shall be my termination: Whether in praise or execration, Still, if you love me, criticise! IX On Some Ghostly Companions at A Spa That was an evil day when I To Strathpeffer drew anigh, For there I found no human soul But Ogres occupied the whole. They had at first a human air In coats and flannel underwear. They rose and walked upon their feet And filled their bellies full of meat. They wiped their lips when they had done, But they were Ogres every one. Each issuing from his secret bower, I marked them in the morning hour. By limp and totter, lisp and droop, I singled each one from the group. I knew them all as they went by— I knew them by their blasted eye! Detested Ogres, from my sight Depart to your congenial night! From these fair vales, from this fair day, Fleet, spectres, on your downward way, Like changing figures in a dream, To Muttonhole or Pittenweem! As, by some harmony divine The devils quartered in the swine, If any baser place exist In God's great registration list— Some den with wallow and a trough— Find it, ye ogres, and be off! X Brasheanna Sonnets on Peter Brash, a publican, dedicated to Charles Baxter I We found him first as in the dells of May The dreaming damsel finds the earliest flower; Thoughtless we wandered in the evening hour; Aimless and pleased we went our random way: In the foot-haunted city in the night, Among the alternate lamps, we went and came Till, like a humourous thunderbolt, that name, The hated name of Brash, assailed our sight. We saw, we paused, we entered, seeking gin. His wrath, like a huge breaker on the beach, Broke instant forth. He on the counter beat In his infantile fury; and his feet Danced impotent wrath upon the floor within. Still as we fled, we heard his idiot screech. II We found him and we lost. The glorious Brash Fell as the cedar on the mountain side When the resounding thunders far and wide Redoubling grumble, and the instant flash Divides the night a moment and is gone; He fell not unremembered nor unwept; And the dim shop where that great hero slept Is sacred still. We, steering past the Tron And past the College southward, and thy square Fitz-Symon! reach at last that holier clime, And do with tears behold that pot-house, where Brash the divine once ministered in drink, Where Brash, the Beershop Hornet, bowed by time, In futile anger grinned across the zinc. III There let us often wend our pensive way, There often pausing celebrate the past; For though indeed our Brash be dead at last, Perchance his spirit, in some minor way, Nor pure immortal nor entirely dead, Contrives upon the farther shore of death To pick a rank subsistence, and for breath Breathes ague, and drinks creosote of lead, There, on the way to that infernal den, Where burst the flames forth thickly, and the sky Flares horrid through the murk methinks he doles Damned liquors out to Hellward-faring souls, And as his impotent anger ranges high Gibbers and gurgles at the shades of men. IV Alas! that while the beautiful and strong, The pious and the wise, the grave and gay, All journey downward by one common way, Bewailed and honoured yet with flowers and song, There must come crowding with that serious throng, Jostling the ranks of that discreet array, Infirm and scullion spirits of decay, The dull, the droll, the random and the wrong. An ape in church, an artificial limb Tacked to a marble god serene and blind— For such as Brash, high death was not designed, That canonising rite was not for him; Nor where the Martyr and the Hero trod Should idiot Brash go hobbling up to God. V To Goodness or Greatness: to be good and die, Or to be great and live forever great: To be the unknown Smith that saves the state And blooms unhonoured by the public eye: To be the unknown Robinson or Brown Whose piping virtues perish in the mud Or triumphing in blasphemy and blood, The imperial pirate, pickled in renown: Unfaltering Brash the latter number chose Of this eterne antithesis: and still The flower of his immortal memory blows Where'er the spirits of the loathed repose Where'er the trophy of the gibbet hill Dejects the traveller and collects the crows. XI To A. G. Dew-Smith In return for a box of cigarettes Figure me to yourself, I pray— A man of my peculiar cut— Apart from dancing and deray, Into an Alpine valley shut: Shut in a kind of damned Hotel Discountenanced by God and man: The food?—Sir, you would do as well To cram your belly full of bran! The company?—Alas, the day, That I should dwell with such a crew With devil anything to say Nor any one to say it to! The place?—Although they call it Platz, I will be bold and state my view: It's not a place at all—and that's The bottom verity, my Dew. There are, as I will not deny, Innumerable inns; a road; Several Alps indifferent high, The snow's inviolable abode; Eleven English parsons, all Entirely inoffensive; four True human beings—what I call Human—the deuce a cipher more; A climate of surprising worth; Innumerable dogs that bark; Some air, some weather, and some earth; A native race—God save the mark! A race that works yet cannot work, Yodels but cannot yodel right, Such as, unhelpt, with rusty dirk, I vow that I could wholly smite; A river that from morn to night Down all the valley plays the fool; Nor once she pauses in her flight; Nor knows the comforts of a pool. But still keeps up, by straight or bend, The self-same pace that she begun— Still hurry, hurry, to the end— Good God, is that the way to run? If I a river were, I hope That I should better realise The opportunities and scope Of that romantic enterprise. I should not ape the merely strange, But aim besides at the divine; And continuity and change I still should labour to combine. Here should I gallop down the race, Here charge the sterling like a bull; There, as a man might wipe his face, Lie, pleased and panting, in a pool. But what, my Dew, in idle mood, What prate I, minding not my debt? What do I talk of bad or good? The best is still a cigarette. Me, whether evil fate assault, Or smiling providences crown— Whether on high the eternal vault Be blue, or crash with thunder down— I judge the best, whate'er befal, Is still to sit on one's behind And, having duly moistened all, Smoke with an unperturbèd mind. So sitting, so engaged, I write; So puffing, so puffed up, I sing, In modest climates of delight And from the islands of the spring: My manner, even as I can: My matter—Frenchly—to agree As from a much delighted man, A gift unspeakable to me. XII [Long time I lay in little ease] Long time I lay in little ease Where, paced by the Turanian, Marseilles, the many-masted, sees The blue Mediterranean. Now songful in the hour of sport, Now riotous for wages, She camps around her ancient port An ancient of the ages. Algerian airs through all the place Unconquerably sally; Incomparable women pace The shadows of the alley. And high o'er dock and graving yard And where the sky is paler, The golden virgin of the guard Shines, beckoning the sailor. She hears the city roar on high, Thief, prostitute and banker; She sees the masted vessels lie Immovably at anchor. She sees the snowy islets dot The sea's immortal azure, And If, that castellated spot, Tower, turret and embrazure. There Dantès pined; and here today Behold me his successor: For here imprisoned long I lay In pledge for a professor. XIII [My wife and I, in our romantic cot] My wife and I, in our romantic cot, The world forgetting, by the world forgot, High as the gods upon Olympus dwell, Pleased with what things we have, and pleased as well To wait in hope for those which we have not. She burns in ardour for a horse to trot; I stake my votive prayers upon a yacht; Which shall be first remembered, who can tell, My wife or I? Harvests of flowers o'er all our garden-plot, She dreams; and I to enrich a darker spot My unprovided cellar; both to swell Our narrow cottage huge as a hotel, Where portly friends may come and share the lot— Of wife and I. XIV [At morning on the garden seat] At morning on the garden seat I dearly love to drink and eat. To drink and eat, to drink and sing, At morning, in the time of Spring. In winter honest men retire And sup their possets by the fire, But when the Spring comes round, you see, The garden breakfast pleases me. The morning star that melts on high The fires that cleanse the changing sky, The air that smells so new and sweet, All put me in the cue to eat A pot at five, a crust at four, At half past six a pottle more. XV [Last night we had a thunderstorm in style.] Last night we had a thunderstorm in style. The wild lightning streaked the airs, As though my God fell down a pair of stairs. The thunder boomed and bounded all the while; All cried and sat by water-side and stile— To mop our brow had been our chief of cares. I lay in bed with a Voltairean smile, The terror of good, simple guilty pairs, And made this rondeau in ironic style, Last night we had a thunderstorm in style. Our God the Father fell down-stairs, The stark blue lightning went its flight, the while, The very rain you might have heard a mile— The strenuous faithful buckled to their prayers. XVI To Time God of the business man, to thee, O Time, I bow the suppliant knee, And to thy dwarfish temple bring My books as a peace-offering. Thou cleaver of the crowded woods, That drivest from green solitudes The sylvan deer; and dost conspire, Or for the shipyard or the fire, The fall of woodland colonnades; O time, that lovest in the glades To cheer the ringing areas din And let the untrammelled sunshine in: Think but once more, nor let this be, Thy servant should survive to see His native country and his head Lie both alike disforested. XVII Fragment [Thou strainest through the mountain fern] Thou strainest through the mountain fern, A most exiguously thin Burn. For all thy foam, for all thy din, Thee shall the pallid lake inurn, With well-a-day for Mr. Swin- Burne! Take then this quarto in thy fin And, O thou stoker huge and stern, The whole affair, outside and in, Burn! But save the true poetic kin, The works of Mr. Robert Burn! And William Wordsworth upon Tin- Tern! XVIII Burlesque Sonnet To Æneas William Mackintosh Thee, Mackintosh, artificer of light, Thee, the lone smoker hails! the student, thee; Thee, oft upon the ungovernable sea, The seaman, conscious of approaching night; Thou, with industrious fingers, hast outright Mastered that art, of other arts the key, That bids thick night before the morning flee. And lingering day retains for mortal sight. O Promethean workman, thee I hail, Thee hallowed, thee unparalleled, thee bold To affront the reign of sleep and darkness old, Thee William, thee Æneas, thee I sing; Thee by the glimmering taper clear and pale, Of light, and light's purveyance, hail, the king. XIX Rhymes to Henley I O Henley, in my hours of ease You may say anything you please, But when I join the Muses' revel, Begad, I wish you at the devil! In vain my verse I plane and bevel, Like Banville's rhyming devotees; In vain by many an artful swivel Lug in my meaning by degrees; I'm sure to hear my Henley cavil; And grovelling prostrate on my knees, Devote his body to the seas, His correspondence to the devil. II Dear Henley, with a pig's snout on I am starting for London, Where I likely shall arrive On Saturday, if still alive: Perhaps your pirate doctor might See me on Sunday? If all's right, I should then lunch with you and with she Who's dearer to you than you are to me. I shall remain but little time In London, as a wretched clime, But not so wretched (for none are) As that of beastly old Braemar. My doctor sends me skipping. I Have many facts to meet your eye. My pig's snout now upon my face: And I inhale with fishy grace, My gills outflapping right and left, Ol. pin. sylvest. I am bereft Of a great deal of charm by this— Not quite the bull's eye for a kiss— But like the gnome of olden time Or bogey in a pantomime. For ladies' love I once was fit, But now am rather out of it. Where'er I go, revolted curs Snap round my military spurs; The children all retire in fits And scream their bellowses to bits. Little I care: the worst's been done: Now let the cold impoverished sun Drop frozen from his orbit; let Fury and fire, cold, wind, and wet, And cataclysmal mad reverses Rage through the federate universes; Let Lawson triumph, cakes and ale, Whiskey and hock and claret fail; Tobacco, love, and letters perish, With all that any man could cherish: You it may touch, not me. I dwell Too deep already—deep in hell; And nothing can befall, O damn! To make me uglier than I am. III My indefatigable pen I here lay down forever. Men Have used, and left me, and forgot; Men are entirely off the spot; Men are a blague and an abuse; And I commit them to the deuce! IV I had companions, I had friends, I had of whisky various blends. The whisky was all drunk; and lo! The friends were gone for evermo! V All men are rot: but there are two— Sidney, the oblivious Slade, and you— Who from that rabble stand confest Ten million times the rottenest. VI When I was sick and safe in gaol I thought my friends would never fail. One wrote me nothing; t'other bard Sent me an insolent post card. VII My letters fail, I learn with grief, to please Proud spirits that sit and read them at their ease Not recking how, from an exhausted mind, By wheel and pulley, tug and strain and grind, These humble efforts are expressed, like cheese. VIII We dwell in these melodious days When every author trolls his lays; And all, except myself and you, Must up and print the nonsense, too. Why then, if this be so indeed, If adamantine walls recede And old Apollo's gardens gape For Arry and the grinder's ape; I too may enter in perchance Where paralytic graces dance, And cheering on each tottering set Blow my falsetto flageolet. Section IX is in French verse and is thus omitted. X. A LYTLE JAPE OF TUSHERIE By A. Tusher The pleasant river gushes Among the meadows green; At home the author tushes; For him it flows unseen. The Birds among the B?shes May wanton on the spray; But vain for him who tushes The brightness of the day! The frog among the rushes Sits singing in the blue. By 'r la'ki!n but these tushes Are wearisome to do! The task entirely crushes The spirit of the bard: God pity him who tushes— His task is very hard. The filthy gutter slushes, The clouds are full of rain; But doomed is he who tushes To tush and tush again. At morn with his hair-brushes, Still ‘tush’ he says, and weeps; At night again he tushes, And tushes till he sleeps. And when at length he p?shes Beyond the river dark— 'Las, to the man who tushes, ‘Tush’ shall be God's remark! XX Epitaphs I Here lies a man who never did Anything but what he was bid; Who lived his life in paltry ease, And died of commonplace disease. II The angler rose, he took his rod, He kneeled and made his prayers to God. The living God sat overhead: The angler tripped, the eels were fed. III. ON HIMSELF He may have been this and that, A drunkard or a guttler; He may have been bald and fat— At least he kept a butler. He may have sprung from ill or well, From Emperor or sutler; He may be burning now in Hell— On earth he kept a butler. IV. ON HIMSELF AT THE PIANO Where is now the Père Martini? Where is Bumptious Boccherini? Where are Hertz and Crotch and Batch? —Safe in bed in Colney Hatch? XXI The Fine Pacific Islands Heard in a Public-house at Rotherhithe The jolly English Yellowboy Is a 'ansome coin when new, The Yankee Double-eagle Is large enough for two. O, these may do for seaport towns, For cities these may do; But the dibbs that takes the Hislands Are the dollars of Peru: O, the fine Pacific Hislands, O, the dollars of Peru! It's there we buy the cocoanuts Mast 'eaded in the blue; It's there we trap the lasses All waiting for the crew; It's there we buy the trader's rum What bores a seaman through . . . In the fine Pacific Hislands With the dollars of Peru: In the fine Pacific Hislands With the dollars of Peru! Now, messmates, when my watch is up, And I am quite broached to, I'll give a tip to 'Evving Of the 'ansome thing to do: Let 'em just refit this sailor-man And launch him off anew To cruise among the Hislands With the dollars of Peru: In the fine Pacific Hislands With the dollars of Peru! XXII To Henry James Adela, Adela, Adela Chart What have you done to my elderly heart? Of all the ladies of paper and ink I count you the paragon, call you the pink. The word of your brother depicts you in part: ‘You raving maniac!’ Adela Chart; But in all the asylums that cumber the ground, So delightful a maniac was ne'er to be found. I pore on you, dote on you, clasp you to heart, I laud, love, and laugh at you, Adela Chart, And thank my dear maker the while I admire That I can be neither your husband nor sire. Your husband's, your sire's were a difficult part; You're a byway to suicide, Adela Chart; But to read of, depicted by exquisite James, O, sure you're the flower and quintessence of dames. Eructavit cor meum My heart was inditing a goodly matter about Adela Chart Though oft I've been touched by the volatile dart, To none have I grovelled but Adela Chart, There are passable ladies, no question, in art— But where is the marrow of Adela Chart? I dreamed that to Tyburn I passed in the cart— I dreamed I was married to Adela Chart: From the first I awoke with a palpable start, The second dumbfoundered me, Adela Chart! XXIII Athole Brose Willie an' I cam doun by Blair And in by Tullibardine, The Rye were at the waterside, An' bee-skeps in the garden. I saw the reek of a private still— Says I, ‘Gud Lord, I thank ye!’ As Willie and I cam in by Blair And out by Killiecrankie. Ye hinny bees, ye smuggler lads, Thou, Muse, the bard's protector, I never kent what Rye was for Till I had drunk the nectar! And shall I never drink it mair? Gud troth, I beg your pardon! The neist time I come doun by Blair And in by Tullibardine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS FOR CHILDREN A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM FROM HER BOY For the long nights you lay awake And watched for my unworthy sake: For your most comfortable hand That led me through the uneven land: For all the story-books you read: For all the pains you comforted: For all you pitied, all you bore, In sad and happy days of yore: My second Mother, my first Wife, The angel of my infant life— From the sick child, now well and old, Take, nurse, the little book you hold! And grant it, Heaven, that all who read May find as dear a nurse at need, And every child who lists my rhyme, In the bright, fireside, nursery clime, May hear it in as kind a voice As made my childish days rejoice! R. L. S. I Bed in Summer In winter I get up at night And dress by yellow candle-light. In summer, quite the other way, I have to go to bed by day. I have to go to bed and see The birds still hopping on the tree, Or hear the grown-up people's feet Still going past me in the street. And does it not seem hard to you, When all the sky is clear and blue, And I should like so much to play To have to go to bed by day? II A Thought It is very nice to think The world is full of meat and drink, With little children saying grace In every Christian kind of place. III At the Seaside When I was down beside the sea A wooden spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore. My holes were empty like a cup, In every hole the sea came up, Till it could come no more. IV Young Night Thought All night long and every night, When my mamma puts out the light, I see the people marching by, As plain as day, before my eye. Armies and emperors and kings, All carrying different kinds of things, And marching in so grand a way, You never saw the like by day. So fine a show was never seen, At the great circus on the green; For every kind of beast and man Is marching in that caravan. At first they move a little slow, But still the faster on they go, And still beside them close I keep Until we reach the town of Sleep. V Whole Duty of Children A child should always say what's true And speak when he is spoken to, And behave mannerly at table: At least as far as he is able. VI Rain The rain is raining all around, It falls on field and tree, It rains on the umbrellas here, And on the ships at sea. VII Pirate Story Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing, Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea. Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring, And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea. Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat, Wary of the weather and steering by a star? Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat, To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar? Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea— Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar! Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be, The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore. VIII Foreign Lands Up into the cherry tree Who should climb but little me? I held the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad on foreign lands. I saw the next door garden lie, Adorned with flowers, before my eye, And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before. I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky's blue looking-glass; The dusty roads go up and down With people tramping in to town. If I could find a higher tree Farther and farther I should see, To where the grown-up river slips Into the sea among the ships, To where the roads on either hand Lead onward into fairy land, Where all the children dine at five, And all the playthings come alive. IX Windy Nights Whenever the moon and stars are set, Whenever the wind is high, All night long in the dark and wet, A man goes riding by. Late in the night when the fires are out, Why does he gallop and gallop about? Whenever the trees are crying aloud, And ships are tossed at sea, By, on the highway, low and loud, By at the gallop goes he. By at the gallop he goes, and then By he comes back at the gallop again. X Travel I should like to rise and go Where the golden apples grow; Where below another sky Parrot islands anchored lie, And, watched by cockatoos and goats, Lonely Crusoes building boats; Where in sunshine reaching out Eastern cities, miles about, Are with mosque and minaret Among sandy gardens set, And the rich goods from near and far Hang for sale in the bazaar; Where the Great Wall round China goes, And on one side the desert blows, And with bell and voice and drum, Cities on the other hum; Where are forests, hot as fire, Wide as England, tall as a spire, Full of apes and cocoa-nuts And the negro hunters' huts; Where the knotty crocodile Lies and blinks in the Nile, And the red flamingo flies Hunting fish before his eyes; Where in jungles, near and far, Man-devouring tigers are, Lying close and giving ear Lest the hunt be drawing near, Or a comer-by be seen Swinging in a palanquin; Where among the desert sands Some deserted city stands, All its children, sweep and prince, Grown to manhood ages since, Not a foot in street or house, Not a stir of child or mouse, And when kindly falls the night, In all the town no spark of light. There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan; Light a fire in the gloom Of some dusty dining-room; See the pictures on the walls, Heroes, fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys. XI Singing Of speckled eggs the birdie sings And nests among the trees; The sailor sings of ropes and things In ships upon the seas. The children sing in far Japan, The children sing in Spain; The organ with the organ man Is singing in the rain. XII Looking Forward When I am grown to man's estate I shall be very proud and great. And tell the other girls and boys Not to meddle with my toys. XIII A Good Play We built a ship upon the stairs All made of the back-bedroom chairs, And filled it full of sofa pillows To go a-sailing on the billows. We took a saw and several nails, And water in the nursery pails; And Tom said, ‘Let us also take An apple and a slice of cake’; Which was enough for Tom and me To go a-sailing on, till tea. We sailed along for days and days, And had the very best of plays; But Tom fell out and hurt his knee, So there was no one left but me. XIV Where Go the Boats? Dark brown is the river, Golden is the sand. It flows along for ever, With trees on either hand. Green leaves a-floating, Castles of the foam, Boats of mine a-boating— Where will all come home? On goes the river And out past the mill, Away down the valley, Away down the hill. Away down the river, A hundred miles or more, Other little children Shall bring my boats ashore. XV Auntie's Skirts Whenever Auntie moves around, Her dresses make a curious sound; They trail behind her up the floor, And trundle after through the door. XVI The Land of Counterpane When I was sick and lay a-bed, I had two pillows at my head, And all my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day. And sometimes for an hour or so I watched my leaden soldiers go, With different uniforms and drills, Among the bed-clothes, through the hills; And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up and down among the sheets; Or brought my trees and houses out, And planted cities all about. I was the giant great and still That sits upon the pillow-hill, And sees before him, dale and plain, The pleasant land of counterpane. XVII The Land of Nod From breakfast on through all the day At home among my friends I stay; But every night I go abroad Afar into the Land of Nod. All by myself I have to go, With none to tell me what to do— All alone beside the streams And up the mountain-sides of dreams. The strangest things are there for me, Both things to eat and things to see, And many frightening sights abroad Till morning in the Land of Nod. Try as I like to find the way, I never can get back by day, Nor can remember plain and clear The curious music that I hear. XVIII My Shadow I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, And what can be the use of him is more than I can see. He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head; And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed. The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow— Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow; For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all. He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play, And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way. He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see; I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me! One morning, very early, before the sun was up, I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup; But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head, Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed. XIX System Every night my prayers I say, And get my dinner every day; And every day that I've been good, I get an orange after food. The child that is not clean and neat, With lots of toys and things to eat, He is a naughty child, I'm sure— Or else his dear papa is poor. XX A Good Boy I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day, I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play. And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood, And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good. My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair, And I must off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer. I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise, No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes, But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn, And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn. XXI Escape at Bedtime The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out Through the blinds and the windows and bars; And high overhead and all moving about, There were thousands of millions of stars. There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree, Nor of people in church or the Park, As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me, And that glittered and winked in the dark. The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all, And the star of the sailor, and Mars, These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall Would be half full of water and stars. They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries, And they soon had me packed into bed; But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes, And the stars going round in my head. XXII Marching Song Bring the comb and play upon it! Marching, here we come! Willie cocks his highland bonnet, Johnnie beats the drum. Mary Jane commands the party, Peter leads the rear; Feet in time, alert and hearty, Each a Grenadier! All in the most martial manner Marching double-quick; While the napkin like a banner Waves upon the stick! Here's enough of fame and pillage, Great commander Jane! Now that we've been round the village, Let's go home again. XXIII The Cow The friendly cow all red and white, I love with all my heart: She gives me cream with all her might, To eat with apple-tart. She wanders lowing here and there, And yet she cannot stray, All in the pleasant open air, The pleasant light of day; And blown by all the winds that pass And wet with all the showers, She walks among the meadow grass And eats the meadow flowers. XXIV Happy Thought The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings. XXV The Wind I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky; And all around I heard you pass, Like ladies' skirts across the grass— O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song! I saw the different things you did, But always you yourself you hid. I felt you push, I heard you call, I could not see yourself at all— O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song! O you that are so strong and cold, O blower, are you young or old? Are you a beast of field and tree, Or just a stronger child than me? O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song! XXVI Keepsake Mill Over the borders, a sin without pardon, Breaking the branches and crawling below, Out through the breach in the wall of the garden, Down by the banks of the river, we go. Here is the mill with the humming of thunder, Here is the weir with the wonder of foam, Here is the sluice with the race running under— Marvellous places, though handy to home! Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller, Stiller the note of the birds on the hill; Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller, Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill. Years may go by, and the wheel in the river Wheel as it wheels for us, children, today, Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever Long after all of the boys are away. Home from the Indies and home from the ocean, Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home; Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion, Turning and churning that river to foam. You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled, I with your marble of Saturday last, Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled, Here we shall meet and remember the past. XXVII Good and Bad Children Children, you are very little, And your bones are very brittle; If you would grow great and stately, You must try to walk sedately. You must still be bright and quiet, And content with simple diet; And remain, through all bewild'ring, Innocent and honest children. Happy hearts and happy faces, Happy play in grassy places— That was how, in ancient ages, Children grew to kings and sages. But the unkind and the unruly, And the sort who eat unduly, They must never hope for glory— Theirs is quite a different story! Cruel children, crying babies, All grow up as geese and gabies, Hated, as their age increases, By their nephews and their nieces. XXVIII Foreign Children Little Indian, Sioux or Crow, Little frosty Eskimo, Little Turk or Japanee, O! don't you wish that you were me? You have seen the scarlet trees And the lions over seas; You have eaten ostrich eggs, And turned the turtles off their legs. Such a life is very fine, But it's not so nice as mine: You must often, as you trod, Have wearied not to be abroad. You have curious things to eat, I am fed on proper meat; You must dwell beyond the foam, But I am safe and live at home. Little Indian, Sioux or Crow, Little frosty Eskimo, Little Turk or Japanee, O! don't you wish that you were me? XXIX The Sun's Travels The sun is not a-bed, when I At night upon my pillow lie; Still round the earth his way he takes, And morning after morning makes. While here at home, in shining day, We round the sunny garden play, Each little Indian sleepy-head Is being kissed and put to bed. And when at eve I rise from tea, Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea, And all the children in the West Are getting up and being dressed. XXX The Lamplighter My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky; It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by; For every night at teatime and before you take your seat, With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street. Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea, And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be; But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do, O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you! For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door, And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more; And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light, O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night! XXXI My Bed is a Boat My bed is like a little boat; Nurse helps me in when I embark; She girds me in my sailor's coat And starts me in the dark. At night, I go on board and say Good-night to all my friends on shore; I shut my eyes and sail away And see and hear no more. And sometimes things to bed I take, As prudent sailors have to do: Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake, Perhaps a toy or two. All night across the dark we steer: But when the day returns at last, Safe in my room, beside the pier, I find my vessel fast. XXXII The Moon The moon has a face like the clock in the hall; She shines on thieves on the garden wall, On streets and fields and harbour quays, And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees. The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse, The howling dog by the door of the house, The bat that lies in bed at noon, All love to be out by the light of the moon. But all of the things that belong to the day Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way; And flowers and children close their eyes Till up in the morning the sun shall arise. XXXIII The Swing How do you like to go up in a swing, Up in the air so blue? Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing Ever a child can do! Up in the air and over the wall, Till I can see so wide, Rivers and trees and cattle and all Over the countryside— Till I look down on the garden green, Down on the roof so brown— Up in the air I go flying again, Up in the air and down! XXXIV Time to Rise A birdie with a yellow bill Hopped upon the window sill, Cocked his shining eye and said: ‘Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?’ XXXV Looking-Glass River Smooth it slides upon its travel, Here a wimple, there a gleam— O the clean gravel! O the smooth stream! Sailing blossoms, silver fishes, Paven pools as clear as air— How a child wishes To live down there! We can see our coloured faces Floating on the shaken pool Down in cool places, Dim and very cool; Till a wind or water wrinkle, Dipping marten, plumping trout, Spreads in a twinkle And blots all out. See the rings pursue each other; All below grows black as night, Just as if mother Had blown out the light! Patience, children, just a minute— See the spreading circles die; The stream and all in it Will clear by-and-by. XXXVI Fairy-Bread Come up here, O dusty feet! Here is fairy-bread to eat. Here in my retiring room, Children, you may dine On the golden smell of broom And the shade of pine; And when you have eaten well, Fairy stories hear and tell. XXXVII From a Railway Carriage Faster than fairies, faster than witches, Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches; And charging along like troops in a battle, All through the meadows the horses and cattle: All of the sights of the hill and the plain Fly as thick as driving rain; And ever again, in the wink of an eye, Painted stations whistle by. Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, All by himself and gathering brambles; Here is a tramp who stands and gazes; And there is the green for stringing the daisies! Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping along with man and load; And here is a mill and there is a river: Each a glimpse and gone for ever! XXXVIII Winter Time Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, A frosty, fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two; and then, A blood-red orange, sets again. Before the stars have left the skies, At morning in the dark I rise; And shivering in my nakedness, By the cold candle, bathe and dress. Close by the jolly fire I sit To warm my frozen bones a bit; Or with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door. When to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap: The cold wind burns my face, and blows Its frosty pepper up my nose. Black are my steps on silver sod; Thick blows my frosty breath abroad; And tree and house, and hill and lake, Are frosted like a wedding-cake. XXXIX The Hayloft Through all the pleasant meadow-side The grass grew shoulder-high, Till the shining scythes went far and wide And cut it down to dry. These green and sweetly smelling crops They led in waggons home; And they piled them here in mountain tops For mountaineers to roam. Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail, Mount Eagle and Mount High; The mice that in these mountains dwell, No happier are than I! O what a joy to clamber there, O what a place for play, With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air, The happy hills of hay! XL Farewell to the Farm The coach is at the door at last; The eager children, mounting fast And kissing hands, in chorus sing: Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! To house and garden, field and lawn, The meadow-gates we swang upon, To pump and stable, tree and swing, Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! And fare you well for evermore, O ladder at the hayloft door, O hayloft where the cobwebs cling, Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! Crack goes the whip, and off we go; The trees and houses smaller grow; Last, round the woody turn we swing: Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! XLI North-West Passage I. GOOD NIGHT When the bright lamp is carried in, The sunless hours again begin; O'er all without, in field and lane, The haunted night returns again. Now we behold the embers flee About the firelit hearth; and see Our faces painted as we pass, Like pictures, on the window-glass. Must we to bed indeed? Well then, Let us arise and go like men, And face with an undaunted tread The long black passage up to bed. Farewell, O brother, sister, sire! O pleasant party round the fire? The songs you sing, the tales you tell, Till far to-morrow, fare ye well! II. SHADOW MARCH All round the house is the jet-black night; It stares through the window-pane; It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light, And it moves with the moving flame. Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum, With the breath of the Bogie in my hair; And all round the candle the crooked shadows come And go marching along up the stair. The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp, The shadow of the child that goes to bed— All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp, With the black night overhead. III. IN PORT Last, to the chamber where I lie My fearful footsteps patter nigh, And come from out the cold and gloom Into my warm and cheerful room. There, safe arrived, we turn about To keep the coming shadows out, And close the happy door at last On all the perils that we past. Then, when mamma goes by to bed, She shall come in with tip-toe tread, And see me lying warm and fast And in the Land of Nod at last. THE CHILD ALONE I The Unseen Playmate When children are playing alone on the green, In comes the playmate that never was seen. When children are happy and lonely and good, The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood. Nobody heard him and nobody saw, His is a picture you never could draw, But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home, When children are happy and playing alone. He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass, He sings when you tinkle the musical glass; Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why, The Friend of the Children is sure to be by! He loves to be little, he hates to be big, 'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig; 'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win. 'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed, Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head; For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf, 'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself! II My Ship and I O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship, Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond; And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about; But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out How to send my vessel sailing on beyond. For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm, And the dolly I intend to come alive; And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go, It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow, And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive. O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds, And you'll hear the water singing at the prow; For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore, To land upon the island where no dolly was before, And to fire the penny cannon in the bow. III My Kingdom Down by a shining water well I found a very little dell, No higher than my head. The heather and the gorse about In summer bloom were coming out, Some yellow and some red. I called the little pool a sea; The little hills were big to me; For I am very small. I made a boat, I made a town, I searched the caverns up and down, And named them one and all. And all about was mine, I said, The little sparrows overhead, The little minnows too. This was the world and I was king; For me the bees came by to sing, For me the swallows flew. I played there were no deeper seas, Nor any wider plains than these, Nor other kings than me. At last I heard my mother call Out from the house at evenfall, To call me home to tea. And I must rise and leave my dell, And leave my dimpled water well, And leave my heather blooms. Alas! and as my home I neared, How very big my nurse appeared, How great and cool the rooms! IV Picture Books in Winter Summer fading, winter comes— Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs, Window robins, winter rooks, And the picture story-books. Water now is turned to stone Nurse and I can walk upon; Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story-books. All the pretty things put by, Wait upon the children's eye, Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks, In the picture story-books. We may see how all things are, Seas and cities, near and far, And the flying fairies' looks, In the picture story-books. How am I to sing your praise, Happy chimney-corner days, Sitting safe in nursery nooks, Reading picture story-books? V My Treasures These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest Where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest, Were gathered in autumn by nursie and me In a wood with a well by the side of the sea. This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!) By the side of a field at the end of the grounds, Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own, It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone! The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey, We discovered I cannot tell how far away; And I carried it back although weary and cold, For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold. But of all of my treasures the last is the king, For there's very few children possess such a thing; And that is a chisel, both handle and blade, Which a man who was really a carpenter made. VI Block City What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks. Rain may keep raining, and others go roam, But I can be happy and building at home. Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea, There I'll establish a city for me: A kirk and a mill and a palace beside, And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride. Great is the palace with pillar and wall, A sort of a tower on the top of it all, And steps coming down in an orderly way To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay. This one is sailing and that one is moored: Hark to the song of the sailors on board! And see on the steps of my palace, the kings Coming and going with presents and things! Now I have done with it, down let it go! All in a moment the town is laid low. Block upon block lying scattered and free, What is there left of my town by the sea? Yet as I saw it, I see it again, The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men, And as long as I live and where'er I may be, I'll always remember my town by the sea. VII The Land of Story-Books At evening, when the lamp is lit, Around the fire my parents sit; They sit at home and talk and sing, And do not play at anything. Now, with my little gun, I crawl All in the dark along the wall, And follow round the forest track Away behind the sofa back. There, in the night, where none can spy, All in my hunter's camp I lie, And play at books that I have read Till it is time to go to bed. These are the hills, these are the woods, These are my starry solitudes; And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink. I see the others far away As if in firelit camp they lay, And I, like to an Indian scout, Around their party prowled about. So, when my nurse comes in for me, Home I return across the sea, And go to bed with backward looks At my dear land of Story-books. VIII Armies in the Fire The lamps now glitter down the street; Faintly sound the falling feet; And the blue even slowly falls About the garden trees and walls. Now in the falling of the gloom The red fire paints the empty room: And warmly on the roof it looks, And flickers on the backs of books. Armies march by tower and spire Of cities blazing, in the fire; Till as I gaze with staring eyes, The armies fade, the lustre dies. Then once again the glow returns; Again the phantom city burns; And down the red-hot valley, lo! The phantom armies marching go! Blinking embers, tell me true Where are those armies marching to, And what the burning city is That crumbles in your furnaces! IX The Little Land When at home alone I sit And am very tired of it, I have just to shut my eyes To go sailing through the skies— To go sailing far away To the pleasant Land of Play; To the fairy land afar Where the Little People are; Where the clover-tops are trees, And the rain-pools are the seas, And the leaves like little ships Sail about on tiny trips; And above the daisy tree Through the grasses, High o'erhead the Bumble Bee Hums and passes. In that forest to and fro I can wander, I can go; See the spider and the fly, And the ants go marching by Carrying parcels with their feet Down the green and grassy street. I can in the sorrel sit Where the ladybird alit. I can climb the jointed grass; And on high See the greater swallows pass In the sky, And the round sun rolling by Heeding no such things as I. Through that forest I can pass Till, as in a looking-glass, Humming fly and daisy tree And my tiny self I see, Painted very clear and neat On the rain-pool at my feet. Should a leaflet come to land Drifting near to where I stand, Straight I'll board that tiny boat Round the rain-pool sea to float. Little thoughtful creatures sit On the grassy coasts of it; Little things with lovely eyes See me sailing with surprise. Some are clad in armour green— (These have sure to battle been!)— Some are pied with ev'ry hue, Black and crimson, gold and blue; Some have wings and swift are gone; But they all look kindly on. When my eyes I once again Open, and see all things plain: High bare walls, great bare floor; Great big knobs on drawer and door; Great big people perched on chairs, Stitching tucks and mending tears, Each a hill that I could climb, And talking nonsense all the time— O dear me, That I could be A sailor on the rain-pool sea, A climber in the clover tree, And just come back, a sleepy head. Late at night to go to bed. GARDEN DAYS I Night and Day When the golden day is done, Through the closing portal, Child and garden, flower and sun, Vanish all things mortal. As the blinding shadows fall, As the rays diminish, Under evening's cloak, they all Roll away and vanish. Garden darkened, daisy shut, Child in bed, they slumber— Glow-worm in the highway rut, Mice among the lumber. In the darkness houses shine, Parents move with candles; Till on all, the night divine Turns the bedroom handles. Till at last the day begins In the east a-breaking, In the hedges and the whins Sleeping birds a-waking. In the darkness shapes of things, Houses, trees, and hedges, Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings Beat on window ledges. These shall wake the yawning maid; She the door shall open— Finding dew on garden glade And the morning broken. There my garden grows again Green and rosy painted, As at eve behind the pane From my eyes it fainted. Just as it was shut away, Toy-like, in the even, Here I see it glow with day Under glowing heaven. Every path and every plot, Every bush of roses, Every blue forget-me-not Where the dew reposes, ‘Up!’ they cry, ‘the day is come On the smiling valleys: We have beat the morning drum; Playmate, join your allies!’ II Nest Eggs Birds all the sunny day Flutter and quarrel Here in the arbour-like Tent of the laurel. Here in the fork The brown nest is seated; Four little blue eggs The mother keeps heated. While we stand watching her, Staring like gabies, Safe in each egg are the Birds' little babies. Soon the frail eggs they shall Chip, and upspringing Make all the April woods Merry with singing. Younger than we are, O children, and frailer, Soon in blue air they'll be. Singer and sailor. We, so much older, Taller and stronger, We shall look down on the Birdies no longer. They shall go flying With musical speeches High overhead in the Tops of the beeches. In spite of our wisdom And sensible talking, We on our feet must go Plodding and walking. III The Flowers All the names I know from nurse: Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse, Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock, And the Lady Hollyhock. Fairy places, fairy things, Fairy woods where the wild bee wings, Tiny trees for tiny dames— These must all be fairy names! Tiny woods below whose boughs Shady fairies weave a house; Tiny tree tops, rose or thyme, Where the braver fairies climb! Fair are grown-up people's trees, But the fairest woods are these; Where if I were not so tall, I should live for good and all. IV Summer Sun Great is the sun, and wide he goes Through empty heaven without repose; And in the blue and glowing days More thick than rain he showers his rays. Though closer still the blinds we pull To keep the shady parlour cool, Yet he will find a chink or two To slip his golden fingers through. The dusty attic spider-clad He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; And through the broken edge of tiles, Into the laddered hayloft smiles. Meantime his golden face around He bares to all the garden ground, And sheds a warm and glittering look Among the ivy's inmost nook. Above the hills, along the blue, Round the bright air with footing true, To please the child, to paint the rose, The gardener of the World, he goes. V The Dumb Soldier When the grass was closely mown, Walking on the lawn alone, In the turf a hole I found And hid a soldier underground. Spring and daisies came apace; Grasses hide my hiding place; Grasses run like a green sea O'er the lawn up to my knee. Under grass alone he lies, Looking up with leaden eyes, Scarlet coat and pointed gun, To the stars and to the sun. When the grass is ripe like grain, When the scythe is stoned again, When the lawn is shaven clear, Then my hole shall reappear. I shall find him, never fear, I shall find my grenadier; But for all that's gone and come, I shall find my soldier dumb. He has lived, a little thing, In the grassy woods of spring; Done, if he could tell me true, Just as I should like to do. He has seen the starry hours And the springing of the flowers; And the fairy things that pass In the forests of the grass. In the silence he has heard Talking bee and ladybird, And the butterfly has flown O'er him as he lay alone. Not a word will he disclose, Not a word of all he knows. I must lay him on the shelf, And make up the tale myself. VI Autumn Fires In the other gardens And all up the vale, From the autumn bonfires See the smoke trail! Pleasant summer over And all the summer flowers, The red fire blazes, The grey smoke towers. Sing a song of seasons! Something bright in all! Flowers in the summer, Fires in the fall! VII The Gardener The gardener does not love to talk, He makes me keep the gravel walk; And when he puts his tools away, He locks the door and takes the key. Away behind the currant row Where no one else but cook may go, Far in the plots, I see him dig Old and serious, brown and big. He digs the flowers, green, red and blue, Nor wishes to be spoken to. He digs the flowers and cuts the hay, And never seems to want to play. Silly gardener! summer goes, And winter comes with pinching toes, When in the garden bare and brown You must lay your barrow down. Well now, and while the summer stays To profit by these garden days O how much wiser you would be To play at Indian wars with me! VIII Historical Associations Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground That now you smoke your pipe around, Has seen immortal actions done And valiant battles lost and won. Here we had best on tip-toe tread, While I for safety march ahead, For this is that enchanted ground Where all who loiter slumber sound. Here is the sea, here is the sand, Here is simple Shepherd's Land, Here are the fairy hollyhocks, And there are Ali Baba's rocks. But yonder, see! apart and high, Frozen Siberia lies; where I, With Robert Bruce and William Tell, Was bound by an enchanter's spell. There, then, awhile in chains we lay, In wintry dungeons, far from day; But ris'n at length, with might and main, Our iron fetters burst in twain. Then all the horns were blown in town; And to the ramparts clanging down, All the giants leaped to horse And charged behind us through the gorse. On we rode, the others and I, Over the mountains blue, and by The Silver River, the sounding sea And the robber woods of Tartary. A thousand miles we galloped fast, And down the witches' lane we passed, And rode amain, with brandished sword, Up to the middle, through the ford. Last we drew rein—a weary three— Upon the lawn, in time for tea, And from our steeds alighted down Before the gates of Babylon. ENVOYS I To Willie and Henrietta If two may read aright These rhymes of old delight And house and garden play, You two, my cousins, and you only, may. You in a garden green With me were king and queen, Were hunter, soldier, tar, And all the thousand things that children are. Now in the elders' seat We rest with quiet feet, And from the window-bay We watch the children, our successors, play. ‘Time was,’ the golden head Irrevocably said; But time which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind. II To My Mother You too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor. III To Auntie Chief of our aunts—not only I, But all your dozen of nurslings cry— What did the other children do? And what were childhood, wanting you? IV To Minnie The red room with the giant bed Where none but elders laid their head; The little room where you and I Did for awhile together lie And, simple suitor, I your hand In decent marriage did demand; The great day nursery, best of all, With pictures pasted on the wall And leaves upon the blind— A pleasant room wherein to wake And hear the leafy garden shake And rustle in the wind— And pleasant there to lie in bed And see the pictures overhead— The wars about Sebastopol, The grinning guns along the wall, The daring escalade, The plunging ships, the bleating sheep, The happy children ankle-deep And laughing as they wade: All these are vanished clean away, And the old manse is changed today; It wears an altered face And shields a stranger race. The river, on from mill to mill, Flows past our childhood's garden still; But ah! we children never more Shall watch it from the water-door! Below the yew—it still is there— Our phantom voices haunt the air As we were still at play, And I can hear them call and say: ‘How far is it to Babylon?’ Ah, far enough, my dear, Far, far enough from here— Yet you have farther gone! ‘Can I get there by candlelight?’ So goes the old refrain. I do not know—perchance you might— But only, children, hear it right, Ah, never to return again! The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt, Shall break on hill and plain, And put all stars and candles out, Ere we be young again. To you in distant India, these I send across the seas, Nor count it far across. For which of us forgets The Indian cabinets, The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross, The pied and painted birds and beans, The junks and bangles, beads and screens, The gods and sacred bells, And the loud-humming, twisted shells? The level of the parlour floor Was honest, homely, Scottish shore; But when we climbed upon a chair, Behold the gorgeous East was there! Be this a fable; and behold Me in the parlour as of old, And Minnie just above me set In the quaint Indian cabinet! Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf Too high for me to reach myself. Reach down a hand, my dear, and take These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake. V To My Name-Child I Some day soon this rhyming volume, if you learn with proper speed, Little Louis Sanchez, will be given you to read. Then shall you discover that your name was printed down By the English printers, long before, in London town. In the great and busy city where the East and West are met, All the little letters did the English printer set; While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play, Foreign people thought of you in places far away. Ay, and while you slept, a baby, over all the English lands Other little children took the volume in their hands; Other children questioned, in their homes across the seas: Who was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please? II Now that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play, Seeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey, Watching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze, Tiny sandy-pipers, and the huge Pacific seas. And remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you, Long ere you could read it, how I told you what to do; And that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey! VI To Any Reader As from the house your mother sees You playing round the garden trees, So you may see, if you will look Through the windows of this book, Another child, far, far away, And in another garden, play. But do not think you can at all, By knocking on the window, call That child to hear you. He intent Is all on his play-business bent. He does not hear; he will not look, Nor yet be lured out of this book. For, long ago, the truth to say, He has grown up and gone away, And it is but a child of air That lingers in the garden there. NOT I AND OTHER POEMS I Not I Some like drink In a pint pot, Some like to think; Some not. Strong Dutch Cheese, Old Kentucky Rye, Some like these; Not I. Some like Poe And others like Scott, Some like Mrs Stowe; Some not. Some like to laugh, Some like to cry. Some like chaff; Not I. II [Here, perfect to a wish] Here, perfect to a wish, We offer, not a dish, But just the platter: A book that's not a book, A pamphlet in the look But not the matter. I own in disarray; As to the flowers of May The frosts of Winter, To my poetic rage, The smallness of the page And of the printer. III [As seamen on the seas] As seamen on the seas With song and dance descry Adown the morning breeze An islet in the sky: In Araby the dry, As o'er the sandy plain The panting camels cry To smell the coming rain. So all things over earth A common law obey And rarity and worth Pass, arm in arm, away; And even so, today, The printer and the bard, In pressless Davos, pray Their sixpenny reward. IV [The pamphlet here presented] The pamphlet here presented Was planned and printed by A printer unindented, A bard whom all decry. The author and the printer, With various kinds of skill, Concocted it in Winter At Davos on the Hill. They burned the nightly taper But now the work is ripe Observe the costly paper, Remark the perfect type! MORAL EMBLEMS I I [See how the children in the print] See how the children in the print Bound on the book to see what's in 't! O, like these pretty babes, may you Seize and apply this volume too! And while your eye upon the cuts With harmless ardour opes and shuts, Reader, may your immortal mind To their sage lessons not be blind. II [Reader, your soul upraise to see] Reader, your soul upraise to see, In yon fair cut designed by me, The pauper by the highwayside Vainly soliciting from pride. Mark how the Beau with easy air Contemns the anxious rustic's prayer, And casting a disdainful eye, Goes gaily gallivanting by. He from the poor averts his head . . . He will regret it when he's dead. III A Peak in Darien Broad-gazing on untrodden lands, See where adventurous Cortez stands; While in the heavens above his head, The Eagle seeks its daily bread. How aptly fact to fact replies: Heroes and Eagles, hills and skies. Ye, who contemn the fatted slave, Look on this emblem and be brave. IV [See in the print, how moved by whim] See in the print, how moved by whim, Trumpeting Jumbo, great and grim, Adjusts his trunk, like a cravat, To noose that individual's hat. The sacred Ibis in the distance Joys to observe his bold resistance. V [Mark, printed on the opposing page] Mark, printed on the opposing page, The unfortunate effects of rage. A man (who might be you or me) Hurls another into the sea. Poor soul, his unreflecting act His future joys will much contract; And he will spoil his evening toddy By dwelling on that mangled body. MORAL EMBLEMS II I [With storms a-weather, rocks a-lee] With storms a-weather, rocks a-lee, The dancing skiff puts forth to sea. The lone dissenter in the blast Recoils before the sight aghast. But she, although the heavens be black, Holds on upon the starboard tack. For why? although today she sink Still safe she sails in printers' ink, And though today the seamen drown, My cut shall hand their memory down. II [The careful angler chose his nook] The careful angler chose his nook At morning by the lilied brook, And all the noon his rod he plied By that romantic riverside. Soon as the evening hours decline Tranquilly he'll return to dine, And breathing forth a pious wish, Will cram his belly full of fish. III [The Abbot for a walk went out] The Abbot for a walk went out A wealthy cleric, very stout, And Robin has that Abbot stuck As the red hunter spears the buck. The djavel or the javelin Has, you observe, gone bravely in, And you may hear that weapon whack Bang through the middle of his back. Hence we may learn that abbots should Never go walking in a wood. IV [The frozen peaks he once explored] The frozen peaks he once explored, But now he's dead and by the board. How better far at home to have stayed Attended by the parlour maid, And warmed his knees before the fire Until the hour when folks retire! So, if you would be spared to friends, Do nothing but for business ends. V [Industrious pirate! see him sweep] Industrious pirate! see him sweep The lonely bosom of the deep, And daily the horizon scan From Hatteras or Matapan. Be sure, before that pirate's old, He will have made a pot of gold, And will retire from all his labours And be respected by his neighbours. You also scan your life's horizon For all that you can clap your eyes on. A MARTIAL ELEGY FOR SOME LEAD SOLDIERS For certain soldiers lately dead Our reverent dirge shall here be said. Them, when their martial leader called, No dread preparative appalled; But leaden-hearted, leaden-heeled, I marked them steadfast in the field. Death grimly sided with the foe, And smote each leaden hero low. Proudly they perished one by one: The dread Pea-cannon's work was done! O not for them the tears we shed, Consigned to their congenial lead; But while unmoved their sleep they take, We mourn for their dear Captain's sake, For their dear Captain, who shall smart Both in his pocket and his heart, Who saw his heroes shed their gore And lacked a shilling to buy more! THE GRAVER AND THE PEN: OR, SCENES FROM NATURE WITH APPROPRIATE VERSES Proem [Unlike the common run of men] Unlike the common run of men, I wield a double power to please, And use the Graver and the Pen With equal aptitude and ease. I move with that illustrious crew, The ambidextrous Kings of Art; And every mortal thing I do Brings ringing money in the mart. Hence, in the morning hour, the mead, The forest and the stream perceive Me wandering as the muses lead— Or back returning in the eve. Two muses like two maiden aunts, The engraving and the singing muse, Follow, through all my favourite haunts, My devious traces in the dews. To guide and cheer me, each attends; Each speeds my rapid task along; One to my cuts her ardour lends, One breathes her magic in my song. The Precarious Mill Alone above the stream it stands, Above the iron hill, The topsy-turvy, tumble-down, Yet habitable mill. Still as the ringing saws advance To slice the humming deal, All day the pallid miller hears The thunder of the wheel. He hears the river plunge and roar As roars the angry mob, He feels the solid building quake, The trusty timbers throb. All night beside the fire he cowers: He hears the rafters jar: O why is he not in a proper house As decent people are! The floors are all aslant, he sees, The doors are all a-jam; And from the hook above his head All crooked swings the ham. ‘Alas,’ he cries and shakes his head, ‘I see by every sign, There soon will be the deuce to pay, With this estate of mine.’ The Disputatious Pines The first pine to the second said ‘My leaves are black, my branches red; I stand upon this moor of mine, A hoar, unconquerable pine.’ The second sniffed and answered ‘Pooh! I am as good a pine as you.’ ‘Discourteous tree,’ the first replied, ‘The tempest in my boughs had cried, The hunter slumbered in my shade, A hundred years ere you were made.’ The second smiled as he returned: ‘I shall be here when you are burned.’ So far dissension ruled the pair, Each turned on each a frowning air, When flickering from the bank anigh, A flight of martins met their eye. Sometime their course they watched; and then They nodded off to sleep again. The Tramps Now long enough has day endured, Or King Apollo Palinured, Seaward he steers his panting team, And casts on earth his latest gleam. But see! the Tramps with jaded eye Their destined provinces espy. Long through the hills their way they took, Long camped beside the mountain brook; 'Tis over; now with rising hope They pause upon the downward slope. And as their aching bones they rest, Their anxious captain scans the west. So paused Alaric on the Alps And ciphered up the Roman scalps. The Foolhardy Geographer The howling desert miles around, The tinkling brook the only sound— Wearied with all his toils and feats, The traveller dines on potted meats; On potted meats and princely wines, Not wisely but too well he dines. The brindled Tiger loud may roar, High may the hovering Vulture soar, Alas! regardless of them all, Soon shall the empurpled glutton sprawl— Soon, in the desert's hushed repose, Shall trumpet tidings through his nose! Alack, unwise! that nasal song Shall be the Ounce's dinner-gong! A blemish in the cut appears; Alas! it cost both blood and tears. The glancing graver swerved aside, Fast flowed the artist's vital tide! And now the apologetic bard Demands indulgence for his pard! The Angler &amp; the Clown The echoing bridge you here may see, The pouring lynn, the waving tree, The eager angler fresh from town— Above, the contumelious clown. The angler plies his line and rod, The clodpole stands with many a nod— With many a nod and many a grin, He sees him cast his engine in. ‘What have you caught?’ the peasant cries. ‘Nothing as yet,’ the Fool replies. MORAL TALES I Robin and Ben: or, the Pirate and the Apothecary Come lend me an attentive ear A startling moral tale to hear, Of Pirate Rob and Chemist Ben, And different destinies of men. Deep in the greenest of the vales That nestle near the coast of Wales, The heaving main but just in view, Robin and Ben together grew, Together worked and played the fool, Together shunned the Sunday school, And pulled each other's youthful noses Around the cots, among the roses. Together but unlike they grew; Robin was rough, and through and through, Bold, inconsiderate, and manly, Like some historic Bruce or Stanley. Ben had a mean and servile soul, He robbed not, though he often stole. He sang on Sunday in the choir, And tamely capped the passing Squire. At length, intolerant of trammels— Wild as the wild Bithynian camels, Wild as the wild sea-eagles—Bob His widowed dam contrives to rob, And thus with great originality Effectuates his personality. Thenceforth his terror-haunted flight He follows through the starry night; And with the early morning breeze, Behold him on the azure seas. The master of a trading dandy Hires Robin for a go of brandy; And all the happy hills of home Vanish beyond the fields of foam. Ben, meanwhile, like a tin reflector, Attended on the worthy rector; Opened his eyes and held his breath, And flattered to the point of death; And was at last, by that good fairy, Apprenticed to the Apothecary. So Ben, while Robin chose to roam, A rising chemist was at home, Tended his shop with learnèd air, Watered his drugs and oiled his hair, And gave advice to the unwary, Like any sleek apothecary. Meanwhile upon the deep afar Robin the brave was waging war, With other tarry desperadoes About the latitude of Barbadoes. He knew no touch of craven fear; His voice was thunder in the cheer; First, from the main-to'-gallan' high, The skulking merchantman to spy— The first to bound upon the deck, The last to leave the sinking wreck. His hand was steel, his word was law, His mates regarded him with awe. No pirate in the whole profession Held a more honourable position. At length, from years of anxious toil, Bold Robin seeks his native soil; Wisely arranges his affairs, And to his native dale repairs. The Bristol Swallow sets him down Beside the well-remembered town. He sighs, he spits, he marks the scene, Proudly he treads the village green; And free from pettiness and rancour, Takes lodgings at the ‘Crown and Anchor.’ Strange, when a man so great and good, Once more in his home-country stood, Strange that the sordid clowns should show A dull desire to have him go. His clinging breeks, his tarry hat, The way he swore, the way he spat, A certain quality of manner, Alarming like the pirate's banner— Something that did not seem to suit all— Something, O call it bluff, not brutal— Something at least, howe'er it's called, Made Robin generally black-balled. His soul was wounded; proud and glum, Alone he sat and swigged his rum, And took a great distaste to men Till he encountered Chemist Ben. Bright was the hour and bright the day, That threw them in each other's way; Glad were their mutual salutations, Long their respective revelations. Before the inn in sultry weather They talked of this and that together; Ben told the tale of his indentures, And Rob narrated his adventures. Last, as the point of greatest weight, The pair contrasted their estate, And Robin, like a boastful sailor, Despised the other for a tailor. ‘See,’ he remarked, ‘with envy, see A man with such a fist as me! Bearded and ringed, and big, and brown, I sit and toss the stingo down, Hear the gold jingle in my bag— All won beneath the Jolly Flag!’ Ben moralised and shook his head: ‘You wanderers earn and eat your bread. The foe is found, beats or is beaten, And either how, the wage is eaten. And after all your pully-hauly Your proceeds look uncommon small-ly. You had done better here to tarry Apprentice to the Apothecary. The silent pirates of the shore Eat and sleep soft, and pocket more Than any red, robustious ranger Who picks his farthings hot from danger. You clank your guineas on the board; Mine are with several bankers stored. You reckon riches on your digits, You dash in chase of Sals and Bridgets, You drink and risk delirium tremens, Your whole estate a common seaman's! Regard your friend and school companion, Soon to be wed to Miss Trevanion (Smooth, honourable, fat and flowery, With Heaven knows how much land in dowry). Look at me—am I in good case? Look at my hands, look at my face; Look at the cloth of my apparel; Try me and test me, lock and barrel; And own, to give the devil his due, I have made more of life than you. Yet I nor sought nor risked a life; I shudder at an open knife; The perilous seas I still avoided And stuck to land whate'er betided. I had no gold, no marble quarry, I was a poor apothecary, Yet here I stand, at thirty-eight, A man of an assured estate.’ ‘Well,’ answered Robin—‘well, and how?’ The smiling chemist tapped his brow. ‘Rob,’ he replied, ‘this throbbing brain Still worked and hankered after gain. By day and night, to work my will, It pounded like a powder mill; And marking how the world went round A theory of theft it found. Here is the key to right and wrong: Steal little, but steal all day long; And this invaluable plan Marks what is called the Honest Man. When first I served with Doctor Pill, My hand was ever in the till. Now that I am myself a master My gains come softer still and faster. As thus: on Wednesday, a maid Came to me in the way of trade. Her mother, an old farmer's wife, Required a drug to save her life. ‘At once, my dear, at once,’ I said, Patted the child upon the head, Bade her be still a loving daughter, And filled the bottle up with water.’ ‘Well, and the mother?’ Robin cried. ‘O she!’ said Ben, ‘I think she died.’ ‘Battle and blood, death and disease, Upon the tainted Tropic seas— The attendant sharks that chew the cud— The abhorred scuppers spouting blood— The untended dead, the Tropic sun— The thunder of the murderous gun— The cut-throat crew—the Captain's curse— The tempest blustering worse and worse— These have I known and these can stand, But you, I settle out of hand!’ Out flashed the cutlass, down went Ben Dead and rotten, there and then. II The Builder's Doom In eighteen-twenty Deacon Thin Feu'd the land and fenced it in, And laid his broad foundations down About a furlong out of town. Early and late the work went on. The carts were toiling ere the dawn; The mason whistled, the hodman sang; Early and late the trowels rang; And Thin himself came day by day To push the work in every way. An artful builder, patent king Of all the local building ring, Who was there like him in the quarter For mortifying brick and mortar, Or pocketing the odd piastre By substituting lath and plaster? With plan and two-foot rule in hand, He by the foreman took his stand, With boisterous voice, with eagle glance To stamp upon extravagance. For thrift of bricks and greed of guilders, He was the Buonaparte of Builders. The foreman, a desponding creature, Demurred to here and there a feature: ‘For surely, sir—with your permeesion— Bricks here, sir, in the main parteetion. . . .’ The builder goggled, gulped and stared, The foreman's services were spared. Thin would not count among his minions A man of Wesleyan opinions. ‘Money is money,’ so he said. ‘Crescents are crescents, trade is trade. Pharaohs and emperors in their seasons Built, I believe, for different reasons— Charity, glory, piety, pride— To pay the men, to please a bride, To use their stone, to spite their neighbours, Not for a profit on their labours. They built to edify or bewilder; I build because I am a builder. Crescent and street and square I build, Plaster and paint and carve and gild. Around the city see them stand, These triumphs of my shaping hand, With bulging walls, with sinking floors, With shut, impracticable doors, Fickle and frail in every part, And rotten to their inmost heart. There shall the simple tenant find Death in the falling window-blind, Death in the pipe, death in the faucet, Death in the deadly water-closet! A day is set for all to die: Caveat emptor! what care I?’ As to Amphion's tuneful kit Thebes rose, with towers encircling it; As to the Mage's brandished wand A spiry palace clove the sand; To Thin's indomitable financing, That phantom crescent kept advancing. When first the brazen bells of churches Called clerk and parson to their perches, The worshippers of every sect Already viewed it with respect; A second Sunday had not gone Before the roof was rattled on: And when the fourth was there, behold The crescent finished, painted, sold! The stars proceeded in their courses, Nature with her subversive forces, Time, too, the iron-toothed and sinewed, And the edacious years continued. Thrones rose and fell; and still the crescent, Unsanative and now senescent, A plastered skeleton of lath, Looked forward to a day of wrath. In the dead night, the groaning timber Would jar upon the ear of slumber, And, like Dodona's talking oak, Of oracles and judgments spoke. When to the music fingered well The feet of children lightly fell, The sire, who dozed by the decanters, Started, and dreamed of misadventures. The rotten brick decayed to dust; The iron was consumed by rust; Each tabid and perverted mansion Hung in the article of declension. So forty, fifty, sixty passed; Until, when seventy came at last, The occupant of number three Called friends to hold a jubilee. Wild was the night; the charging rack Had forced the moon upon her back; The wind piped up a naval ditty; And the lamps winked through all the city. Before that house, where lights were shining, Corpulent feeders, grossly dining, And jolly clamour, hum and rattle, Fairly outvoiced the tempest's battle. As still his moistened lip he fingered, The envious policeman lingered; While far the infernal tempest sped, And shook the country folks in bed, And tore the trees and tossed the ships, He lingered and he licked his lips. Lo, from within, a hush! the host Briefly expressed the evening's toast; And lo, before the lips were dry, The Deacon rising to reply! ‘Here in this house which once I built, Papered and painted, carved and gilt, And out of which, to my content, I netted seventy-five per cent.; Here at this board of jolly neighbours, I reap the credit of my labours. These were the days—I will say more— These were the grand old days of yore! The builder laboured day and night; He watched that every brick was right: The decent men their utmost did; And the house rose—a pyramid! These were the days, our provost knows, When forty streets and crescents rose, The fruits of my creative noddle, All more or less upon a model, Neat and commodious, cheap and dry, A perfect pleasure to the eye! I found this quite a country quarter; I leave it solid lath and mortar. In all, I was the single actor— And am this city's benefactor! Since then, alas! both thing and name, Shoddy across the ocean came— Shoddy that can the eye bewilder And makes me blush to meet a builder! Had this good house, in frame or fixture, Been tempered by the least admixture Of that discreditable shoddy, Should we today compound our toddy, Or gaily marry song and laughter Below its sempiternal rafter? Not so!’ the Deacon cried. The mansion Had marked his fatuous expansion. The years were full, the house was fated, The rotten structure crepitated! A moment, and the silent guests Sat pallid as their dinner vests. A moment more, and root and branch, That mansion fell in avalanche, Story on story, floor on floor, Roof, wall and window, joist and door, Dead weight of damnable disaster, A cataclysm of lath and plaster. Siloam did not choose a sinner— All were not builders at the dinner.</field>
