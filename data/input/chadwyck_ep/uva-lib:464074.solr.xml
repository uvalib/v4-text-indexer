Broadside in the Rawlinson collection, 4to, 566, fol. 193, Wood, E. 25, fol. 15. b. Pepys, iii, 19, No 17. c. Douce, ii, fol. 168 b. d. Pills to Purge Melancholy, iv, 130, ed. 1719. 1 There was a lady of the North Country, Lay the bent to the bonny broom And she had lovely daughters three. Fa la la la, fa la la la ra re 2 There was a knight of noble worth Which also lived in the North. 3 The knight, of courage stout and brave, A wife he did desire to have. 4 He knocked at the ladie's gate One evening when it was late. 5 The eldest sister let him in, And pin'd the door with a silver pin. 6 The second sister she made his bed, And laid soft pillows under his head. 7 The youngest daughter that same night, She went to bed to this young knight. 8 And in the morning, when it was day, These words unto him she did say: 9 ‘Now you have had your will,’ quoth she, ‘I pray, sir knight, will you marry me?’ 10 The young brave knight to her replyed, ‘Thy suit, fair maid, shall not be deny'd. 11 ‘If thou canst answer me questions three, This very day will I marry thee.’ 12 ‘Kind sir, in love, O then,’ quoth she, ‘Tell me what your [three] questions be.’ 13 ‘O what is longer than the way, Or what is deeper than the sea? 14 ‘Or what is louder than the horn, Or what is sharper than a thorn? 15 ‘Or what is greener than the grass, Or what is worse then a woman was?’ 16 ‘O love is longer than the way, And hell is deeper than the sea. 17 ‘And thunder is louder than the horn, And hunger is sharper than a thorn. 18 ‘And poyson is greener than the grass, And the Devil is worse than woman was.’ 19 When she these questions answered had, The knight became exceeding glad. 20 And having [truly] try'd her wit, He much commended her for it. 21 And after, as it is verifi'd, He made of her his lovely bride. 22 So now, fair maidens all, adieu, This song I dedicate to you. 23 I wish that you may constant prove Vnto the man that you do love. The Three Sisters RIDDLES WISELY EXPOUNDED—B Gilbert's Christmas Carols, 2d ed., p. 65, from the editor's recollection. West of England. 1 There were three sisters fair and bright, Jennifer gentle and rosemaree And they three loved one valiant knight. As the dew flies over the mulberry tree 2 The eldest sister let him in, And barred the door with a silver pin. 3 The second sister made his bed, And placed soft pillows under his head. 4 The youngest sister, fair and bright, Was resolved for to wed with this valiant knight. 5 ‘And if you can answer questions three, O then, fair maid, I will marry with thee. 6 ‘What is louder than an horn, And what is sharper than a thorn? 7 ‘Thunder is louder than an horn, And hunger is sharper than a thorn.’ 8 ‘What is broader than the way, And what is deeper than the sea?’ 9 ‘Love is broader than the way, And hell is deeper than the sea.’ 10 ‘And now, fair maid, I will marry with thee.’ The Unco Knicht's Wowing RIDDLES WISELY EXPOUNDED—C Motherwell's MS., p. 647. From the recitation of Mrs Storie. 1 There was a knicht riding frae the east, Sing the Cather banks, the bonnie brume Wha had been wooing at monie a place.

And what is deeper nor the sea? 10 ‘Or what is heavier nor the lead? And what is better nor the breid? 11 ‘O what is whiter nor the milk? Or what is safter nor the silk? 12 ‘Or what is sharper nor a thorn? Or what is louder nor a horn? 13 ‘Or what is greener nor the grass? Or what is waur nor a woman was?’ 14 ‘O heaven is higher nor the tree, And hell is deeper nor the sea. 15 ‘O sin is heavier nor the lead, The blessing's better nor the bread. 16 ‘The snaw is whiter nor the milk, And the down is safter nor the silk. 17 ‘Hunger is sharper nor a thorn, And shame is louder nor a horn. 18 ‘The pies are greener nor the grass, And Clootie's waur nor a woman was.’ 19 As sune as she the fiend did name, He flew awa in a blazing flame.

And you may beguile a fair maid soon 2 ‘O what is whiter than the milk? Or what is softer than the silk? 3 ‘O what is sharper than the thorn? O what is louder than the horn? 4 ‘O what is longer than the way? And what is colder than the clay? 5 ‘O what is greener than the grass?

Fa lang the dillo Fa lang the dillo dillo dee 2 There came a stranger to the gate, And he three days and nights did wait. 3 The eldest daughter did ope the door, The second set him on the floor. 4 The third daughter she brought a chair, And placed it that he might sit there.

(To all three.) 7 ‘Now answer me these questions nine, Or you shall surely all be mine. 8 ‘What is greener than the grass? What is smoother than crystal glass? 9 ‘What is louder than a horn? What is sharper than a thorn? 10 ‘What is brighter than the light? What is darker than the night? 11 ‘What is keener than an axe? What is softer than melting wax? 12 ‘What is rounder than a ring?’ ‘To you we thus our answers bring. 13 ‘Envy is greener than the grass, Flattery smoother than crystal glass. 14 ‘Rumour is louder than a horn, Hunger is sharper than a thorn. 15 ‘Truth is brighter than the light, Falsehood is darker than the night. 16 ‘Revenge is keener than an axe, Love is softer than melting wax. 17 ‘The world is rounder than a ring, To you we thus our answers bring. 18 ‘Thus you have our answers nine, And we never shall be thine.’ 2 THE ELFIN KNIGHT A proper new ballad entituled The Wind hath blown my Plaid away; or, A Discourse betwixt a young [Wo]man and the Elphin Knight THE ELFIN KNIGHT—A A broadside in black letter, “printed, I suppose,” says Pinkerton, “about 1670,” bound up with five other pieces at the end of a copy of Blind Harry's ‘Wallace,’ Edin. 1673, in the Pepysian Library.

Partly from an old copy in black letter, and partly from the recitation of an old lady.

The Elfin Knicht THE ELFIN KNIGHT—C Kinloch's A. S. Ballads, p. 145. From the recitation of M.

If ye canna gang, I will cause you to ride.’ 6 He leapt on a horse, and she on another, And they rode on to the greenwood together. 7 ‘Light down, light down, lady Isabel,’ said he, ‘We are come to the place where ye are to die.’ 8 ‘Hae mercy, hae mercy, kind sir, on me, Till ance my dear father and mother I see.’ 9 ‘Seven king's-daughters here hae I slain, And ye shall be the eight o them.’ 10 ‘O sit down a while, lay your head on my knee, That we may hae some rest before that I die.’ 11 She stroakd him sae fast, the nearer he did creep, Wi a sma charm she lulld him fast asleep. 12 Wi his ain sword-belt sae fast as she ban him, Wi his ain dag-durk sae sair as she dang him. 13 ‘If seven king's-daughters here ye hae slain, Lye ye here, a husband to them a'.’ The Water o Wearie's Well; or, Wearie's Wells LADY ISABEL AND THE ELF-KNIGHT—B a.

What has become of false Sir John, That woo'd you so late the streen? 14 ‘He woo'd you butt, he woo'd you ben, He woo'd you in the ha, Until he got your own consent For to mount and gang awa.’ 15 ‘O hold your tongue, my pretty parrot, Lay not the blame upon me; Your cup shall be of the flowered gold, Your cage of the root of the tree.’ 16 Up then spake the king himself, In the bed-chamber where he lay: ‘What ails the pretty parrot, That prattles so long or day?’ 17 ‘There came a cat to my cage door, It almost a worried me, And I was calling on May Colven To take the cat from me.’ May Collin; or, Fause Sir John and May Colvin; or, May Collean LADY ISABEL AND THE ELF-KNIGHT—D a.

For he has betrayed eight ladies fair And drowned them in the sea. 2 Then next he went to May Collin, She was her father's heir, The greatest beauty in the land, I solemnly declare. 3 ‘I am a knight of wealth and might, Of townlands twenty-three; And you'll be lady of them all, If you will go with me.’ 4 ‘Excuse me, then, Sir John,’ she says; ‘To wed I am too young; Without I have my parents' leave, With you I darena gang.’ 5 ‘Your parents' leave you soon shall have, In that they will agree; For I have made a solemn vow This night you'll go with me.’ 6 From below his arm he pulled a charm, And stuck it in her sleeve, And he has made her go with him, Without her parents' leave. 7 Of gold and silver she has got With her twelve hundred pound, And the swiftest steed her father had She has taen to ride upon. 8 So privily they went along, They made no stop or stay, Till they came to the fatal place That they call Bunion Bay. 9 It being in a lonely place, And no house there was nigh, The fatal rocks were long and steep, And none could hear her cry. 10 ‘Light down,’ he said, ‘fair May Collin, Light down and speak with me, For here I've drowned eight ladies fair, And the ninth one you shall be.’ 11 ‘Is this your bowers and lofty towers, So beautiful and gay? Or is it for my gold,’ she said, ‘You take my life away?’ 12 ‘Strip off,’ he says, ‘thy jewels fine, So costly and so brave, For they are too costly and too fine To throw in the sea wave.’ 13 ‘Take all I have my life to save, O good Sir John, I pray; Let it neer be said you killed a maid Upon her wedding day.’ 14 ‘Strip off,’ he says, ‘thy Holland smock, That's bordered with the lawn, For it's too costly and too fine To rot in the sea sand.’ 15 ‘O turn about, Sir John,’ she said, ‘Your back about to me, For it never was comely for a man A naked woman to see.’ 16 But as he turned him round about, She threw him in the sea, Saying, ‘Lie you there, you false Sir John, Where you thought to lay me. 17 ‘O lie you there, you traitor false, Where you thought to lay me, For though you stripped me to the skin, Your clothes you've got with thee.’ 18 Her jewels fine she did put on, So costly, rich and brave, And then with speed she mounts his steed, So well she did behave. 19 That lady fair being void of fear, Her steed being swift and free, And she has reached her father's gate Before the clock struck three. 20 Then first she called the stable groom, He was her waiting man; Soon as he heard his lady's voice He stood with cap in hand. 21 ‘Where have you been, fair May Collin? Who owns this dapple grey?’ ‘It is a found one,’ she replied, ‘That I got on the way.’ 22 Then out bespoke the wily parrot Unto fair May Collin: ‘What have you done with false Sir John, That went with you yestreen?’ 23 ‘O hold your tongue, my pretty parrot, And talk no more to me, And where you had a meal a day O now you shall have three.’ 24 Then up bespoke her father dear, From his chamber where he lay: ‘What aileth thee, my pretty Poll, That you chat so long or day?’ 25 ‘The cat she came to my cage-door, The thief I could not see, And I called to fair May Collin, To take the cat from me.’ 26 Then first she told her father dear The deed that she had done, And next she told her mother dear Concerning false Sir John. 27 ‘If this be true, fair May Collin, That you have told to me, Before I either eat or drink This false Sir John I'll see.’ 28 Away they went with one consent, At dawning of the day, Until they came to Carline Sands, And there his body lay. 29 His body tall, by that great fall, By the waves tossed to and fro, The diamond ring that he had on Was broke in pieces two. 30 And they have taken up his corpse To yonder pleasant green, And there they have buried false Sir John, For fear he should be seen. The Outlandish Knight LADY ISABEL AND THE ELF-KNIGHT—E J. H.

Or the stirrups for you too long?’ 15 ‘But, little boy, will ye tell me The fashions that are in your countrie?’ 16 ‘The fashions in our ha I'll tell, And o them a' I'll warn you well. 17 ‘When ye come in upon the floor, His mither will meet you wi a golden chair. 18 ‘But be ye maid or be ye nane, Unto the high seat make ye boun. 19 ‘Lord Dingwall aft has been beguild By girls whom young men hae defiled. 20 ‘He's cutted the paps frae their breast-bane, And sent them back to their ain hame.’ 21 When she came in upon the floor, His mother met her wi a golden chair. 22 But to the high seat she made her boun: She knew that maiden she was nane. 23 When night was come, they went to bed, And ower her breast his arm he laid. 24 He quickly jumped upon the floor, And said, ‘I've got a vile rank whore.’ 25 Unto his mother he made his moan, Says, ‘Mother dear, I am undone. 26 ‘Ye've aft tald, when I brought them hame, Whether they were maid or nane. 27 ‘I thought I'd gotten a maiden bright; I've gotten but a waefu wight. 28 ‘I thought I'd gotten a maiden clear, But gotten but a vile rank whore.’ 29 ‘When she came in upon the floor, I met her wi a golden chair. 30 ‘But to the high seat she made her boun, Because a maiden she was nane.’ 31 ‘I wonder wha's tauld that gay ladie The fashion into our countrie.’ 32 ‘It is your little boy I blame, Whom ye did send to bring her hame.’ 33 Then to the lady she did go, And said, ‘O Lady, let me know 34 ‘Who has defiled your fair bodie: Ye're the first that has beguiled me.’ 35 ‘O we were sisters, sisters seven, The fairest women under heaven. 36 ‘And we kiest kevels us amang, Wha woud to the grenewood gang; 37 ‘For to pu the finest flowers, To put around our summer bowers. 38 ‘I was the youngest o them a'; The hardest fortune did me befa. 39 ‘Unto the grenewood I did gang, And pu'd the nuts as they down hang. 40 ‘I hadna stayd an hour but ane Till I met wi a highlan groom. 41 ‘He keeped me sae late and lang Till the evening set and birds they sang. 42 ‘He gae to me at our parting A chain of gold and gay gold ring; 43 ‘And three locks o his yellow hair; Bade me keep them for evermair. 44 ‘Then for to show I make nae lie, Look ye my trunk, and ye will see.’ 45 Unto the trunk then she did go, To see if that were true or no. 46 And aye she sought, and aye she flang, Till these four things came to her hand. 47 Then she did to her ain son go, And said, ‘My son, ye'll let me know, 48 ‘Ye will tell to me this thing: What did you wi my wedding-ring?’ 49 ‘Mother dear, I'll tell nae lie: I gave it to a gay ladie. 50 ‘I would gie a' my ha's and towers, I had this bird within my bowers.’ 51 ‘Keep well, keep well your lands and strands; Ye hae that bird within your hands. 52 ‘Now, my son, to your bower ye'll go: Comfort your ladie, she's full o woe.’ 53 Now when nine months were come and gane, The lady she brought hame a son. 54 It was written on his breast-bane Lord Dingwall was his father's name. 55 He's taen his young son in his arms, And aye he praisd his lovely charms. 56 And he has gien him kisses three, And doubled them ower to his ladie.

Hey, etc. 2 As he was walking late alone, He spyed a lady both brisk and young. 3 He keeped her so long and long, From the evening late till the morning came. 4 All that he gave her at their parting Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring. 5 Lord Benwall he's a wooing gone, And he's taken with him all his merry men. 6 As he was walking the Haleigh throw, He spy'd seven ladyes all in a row. 7 He cast a lot among them all; Upon the youngest the lot did fall. 8 He wedded her and brought her home, And by the way she made great moan. 9 ‘What aileth my dearest and dayly flower? What ails my dear, to make such moan? 10 ‘Does the steed carry you too high? Or does thy pillow sit awry? 11 ‘Or does the wind blow in thy glove? Or is thy heart after another love?’ 12 ‘The steed does not carry me too high, Nor does my pillow sit awry. 13 ‘Nor does the wind blow in my glove, Nor is my heart after another love.’ 14 When they were doun to supper set, The weary pain took her by the back. 15 ‘What ails my dearest and dayly flower? What ails my dearest, to make such moan?’ 16 ‘I am with child, and it's not to thee, And oh and alas, what shall I doe!’ 17 ‘I thought I had got a maid so mild; But I have got a woman big with child. 18 ‘I thought I had got a dayly flower; I have gotten but a common whore.’ 19 ‘Rise up, Lord Benwall, go to your hall, And cherrish up your merry men all.’ 20 ‘As I was walking once late alone, I spy'd a lord, both brisk and young. 21 ‘He keeped me so long and long, From the evening late till the morning came. 22 ‘All that he gave me at our parting Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring. 23 ‘If you will not believe what I tell to thee, There's the key of my coffer, you may go and see.’ 24 His mother went, and threw and flang, Till to her hand the ring it came. 25 ‘Lord Benwall, wilt thou tell to me Where is the ring I gave to thee?’ 26 ‘Now I would give all my lands and tower, To have that lady in my bower. 27 ‘I would give all my lands and rents, To have that lady in my tents.’ 28 ‘You need not give all your lands and tower, For you have that lady in your power. 29 ‘You need not give all your lands and rents, For you have that lady in your tents.’ 30 Now it was written on the child's breast-bone Lord Benwall's sirname and his name. 31 It was written on the child's right hand That he should be heir of Lord Benwall's land. 32 ‘Canst cloath my lady in the silk, And feed my young son with the milk.’ Lord Brangwill; or, Lord Bengwill GIL BRENTON—F a.

Bell, Ancient Poems, Ballads, etc. (1857), p. 122: d, fragmentary lines as remembered by Mrs Andrews, Mr White's sister, from her mother's singing. 1 Oh did ye ever hear o brave Earl Bran? Ay lally, o lilly lally He courted the king's daughter of fair England. All i the night sae early 2 She was scarcely fifteen years of age Till sae boldly she came to his bedside. 3 ‘O Earl Bran, fain wad I see A pack of hounds let loose on the lea.’ 4 ‘O lady, I have no steeds but one, And thou shalt ride, and I will run.’ 5 ‘O Earl Bran, my father has two, And thou shall have the best o them a.’ 6 They have ridden oer moss and moor, And they met neither rich nor poor. 7 Until they met with old Carl Hood; He comes for ill, but never for good. 8 ‘Earl Bran, if ye love me, Seize this old carl, and gar him die.’ 9 ‘O lady fair, it wad be sair, To slay an old man that has grey hair. 10 ‘O lady fair, I'll no do sae; I'll gie him a pound, and let him gae.’ 11 ‘O where hae ye ridden this lee lang day? Or where hae ye stolen this lady away?’ 12 ‘I have not ridden this lee lang day, Nor yet have I stolen this lady away. 13 ‘She is my only, my sick sister, Whom I have brought from Winchester.’ 14 ‘If she be sick, and like to dead, Why wears she the ribbon sae red? 15 ‘If she be sick, and like to die, Then why wears she the gold on high?’ 16 When he came to this lady's gate, Sae rudely as he rapped at it. 17 ‘O where's the lady o this ha?’ ‘She's out with her maids to play at the ba.’ 18 ‘Ha, ha, ha! ye are a' mistaen: Gae count your maidens oer again. 19 ‘I saw her far beyond the moor, Away to be the Earl o Bran's whore.’ 20 The father armed fifteen of his best men, To bring his daughter back again. 21 Oer her left shoulder the lady looked then: ‘O Earl Bran, we both are tane.’ 22 ‘If they come on me ane by ane, Ye may stand by and see them slain. 23 ‘But if they come on me one and all, Ye may stand by and see me fall.’ 24 They have come on him ane by ane, And he has killed them all but ane. 25 And that ane came behind his back, And he's gien him a deadly whack. 26 But for a' sae wounded as Earl Bran was, He has set his lady on her horse. 27 They rode till they came to the water o Doune, And then he alighted to wash his wounds. 28 ‘O Earl Bran, I see your heart's blood!’ ‘T is but the gleat o my scarlet hood.’ 29 They rode till they came to his mother's gate, And sae rudely as he rapped at it. 30 ‘O my son's slain, my son's put down, And a' for the sake of an English loun.’ 31 ‘O say not sae, my dear mother, But marry her to my youngest brother. 32 ‘This has not been the death o ane, But it's been that of fair seventeen.’ The Douglas Tragedy EARL BRAND—B Scott's Minstrelsy, iii, 246, ed. 1803; iii, 6, ed. 1833: the copy principally used supplied by Mr Sharpe, the three last stanzas from a penny pamphlet and from tradition. 1 ‘Rise up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas,’ she says, ‘And put on your armour so bright; Let it never be said that a daughter of thine Was married to a lord under night. 2 ‘Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons, And put on your armour so bright, And take better care of your youngest sister, For your eldest's awa the last night.’ 3 He's mounted her on a milk-white steed, And himself on a dapple grey, With a bugelet horn hung down by his side, And lightly they rode away. 4 Lord William lookit oer his left shoulder, To see what he could see, And there he spy'd her seven brethren bold, Come riding over the lee. 5 ‘Light down, light down, Lady Margret,’ he said, ‘And hold my steed in your hand, Until that against your seven brethren bold, And your father, I mak a stand.’ 6 She held his steed in her milk-white hand, And never shed one tear, Until that she saw her seven brethren fa, And her father hard fighting, who lovd her so dear. 7 ‘O hold your hand, Lord William!’ she said, ‘For your strokes they are wondrous sair; True lovers I can get many a ane, But a father I can never get mair.’ 8 O she's taen out her handkerchief, It was o the holland sae fine, And aye she dighted her father's bloody wounds, That were redder than the wine. 9 ‘O chuse, O chuse, Lady Margret,’ he said, ‘O whether will ye gang or bide?’ ‘I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William,’ she said, ‘For ye have left me no other guide.’ 10 He's lifted her on a milk-white steed, And himself on a dapple grey, With a bugelet horn hung down by his side, And slowly they baith rade away. 11 O they rade on, and on they rade, And a' by the light of the moon, Until they came to yon wan water, And there they lighted down. 12 They lighted down to tak a drink Of the spring that ran sae clear, And down the stream ran his gude heart's blood, And sair she gan to fear. 13 ‘Hold up, hold up, Lord William,’ she says, ‘For I fear that you are slain;’ ‘'Tis naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak, That shines in the water sae plain.’ 14 O they rade on, and on they rade, And a' by the light of the moon, Until they cam to his mother's ha door, And there they lighted down. 15 ‘Get up, get up, lady mother,’ he says, ‘Get up, and let me in! Get up, get up, lady mother,’ he says, ‘For this night my fair lady I've win. 16 ‘O mak my bed, lady mother,’ he says, ‘O mak it braid and deep, And lay Lady Margret close at my back, And the sounder I will sleep.’ 17 Lord William was dead lang ere midnight, Lady Margret lang ere day, And all true lovers that go thegither, May they have mair luck than they! 18 Lord William was buried in St. Mary's kirk, Lady Margret in Mary's quire; Out o the lady's grave grew a bonny red rose, And out o the knight's a briar. 19 And they twa met, and they twa plat, And fain they wad be near; And a' the warld might ken right weel They were twa lovers dear. 20 But bye and rade the Black Douglas, And wow but he was rough! For he pulld up the bonny brier, And flang't in St. Mary's Loch. Lord Douglas EARL BRAND—C Motherwell's MS., p. 502. From the recitation of Mrs Notman. 1 ‘Rise up, rise up, my seven brave sons, And dress in your armour so bright; Earl Douglas will hae Lady Margaret awa Before that it be light. 2 ‘Arise, arise, my seven brave sons, And dress in your armour so bright; It shall never be said that a daughter of mine Shall go with an earl or a knight.’ 3 ‘O will ye stand, fair Margaret,’ he says, ‘And hold my milk-white steed, Till I fight your father and seven brethren, In yonder pleasant mead?’ 4 She stood and held his milk-white steed, She stood trembling with fear, Until she saw her seven brethren fall, And her father that loved her dear. 5 ‘Hold your hand, Earl Douglas,’ she says, ‘Your strokes are wonderous sair; I may get sweethearts again enew, But a father I'll ne'er get mair.’ 6 She took out a handkerchief Was made o' the cambrick fine, And aye she wiped her father's bloody wounds, And the blood sprung up like wine. 7 ‘Will ye go, fair Margaret?’ he said, ‘Will ye now go, or bide?’ ‘Yes, I'll go, sweet William,’ she said, ‘For ye've left me never a guide. 8 ‘If I were to go to my mother's house, A welcome guest I would be; But for the bloody deed that's done this day I'll rather go with thee.’ 9 He lifted her on a milk-white steed And himself on a dapple gray; They drew their hats out over their face, And they both went weeping away. 10 They rode, they rode, and they better rode, Till they came to yon water wan; They lighted down to gie their horse a drink Out of the running stream. 11 ‘I am afraid, Earl Douglas,’ she said, ‘I am afraid ye are slain;’ I think I see your bonny heart's blood Running down the water wan.’ 12 ‘Oh no, oh no, fair Margaret,’ he said, ‘Oh no, I am not slain; It is but the scad of my scarlet cloak Runs down the water wan.’ 13 He mounted her on a milk-white steed And himself on a dapple gray, And they have reached Earl Douglas' gates Before the break of day. 14 ‘O rise, dear mother, and make my bed, And make it braid and wide, And lay me down to take my rest, And at my back my bride.’ 15 She has risen and made his bed, She made it braid and wide; She laid him down to take his rest, And at his back his bride. 16 Lord William died ere it was day, Lady Margaret on the morrow; Lord William died through loss of blood and wounds, Fair Margaret died with sorrow. 17 The one was buried in Mary's kirk, The other in Mary's quire; The one sprung up a bonnie bush, And the other a bonny brier. 18 These twa grew, and these twa threw, Till they came to the top, And when they could na farther gae, They coost the lovers' knot.

Rise up, make a match for your eldest daughter, For the youngest I carry away.’ 2 ‘Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons, Dress yourselves in the armour sae fine; For it ne'er shall be said that a churlish knight Eer married a daughter of mine.’ 3 ‘Loup aff, loup aff, Lady Margaret,’ he said, ‘And hold my steed in your hand, And I will go fight your seven brethren, And your father, where they stand.’ 4 Sometimes she gaed, sometimes she stood, But never dropt a tear, Until she saw her brethren all slain, And her father who lovd her so dear. 5 ‘Hold thy hand, sweet William,’ she says, ‘Thy blows are wondrous sore; Sweethearts I may have many a one, But a father I'll never have more.’ 6 O she's taken her napkin frae her pocket, Was made o the holland fine, And ay as she dichted her father's bloody wounds, They sprang as red as the wine. 7 ‘Two chooses, two chooses, Lady Margret,’ he says, ‘Two chooses I'll make thee; Whether to go back to your mother again, Or go along with me.’ 8 ‘For to go home to my mother again, An unwelcome guest I'd be; But since my fate has ordered it so, I'll go along with thee.’ 9 He has mounted her on a milk-white steed, Himself on the dapple gray, And blawn his horn baith loud and shill, And it sounded far on their way. 10 They rode oer hill, they rode oer dale, They rode oer mountains so high, Until they came to that beautiful place Where Sir William's mother did lie. 11 ‘Rise up, rise up, lady mother,’ he said, ‘Rise up, and make much o your own; Rise up, rise up, lady mother,’ he said, ‘For his bride's just new come home.’ 12 Sir William he died in the middle o the night, Lady Margaret died on the morrow; Sir William he died of pure pure love, Lady Margaret of grief and sorrow. The Douglas Tragedy EARL BRAND—E Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 180. From recitation. 1 He has lookit over his left shoulder, And through his bonnie bridle rein, And he spy'd her father and her seven bold brethren, Come riding down the glen. 2 ‘O hold my horse, Lady Margret,’ he said, O hold my horse by the bonnie bridle rein, Till I fight your father and seven bold brethren, As they come riding down the glen.’ 3 Some time she rade, and some time she gaed, Till she that place did near, And there she spy'd her seven bold brethren slain, And her father who loved her so dear. 4 ‘O hold your hand, sweet William,’ she said, ‘Your bull baits are wondrous sair; Sweet-hearts I may get many a one, But a father I will never get mair.’ 5 She has taken a napkin from off her neck, That was of the cambrick so fine, And aye as she wiped her father's bloody wounds, The blood ran red as the wine. 6 He set her upon the milk-white steed, Himself upon the brown; He took a horn out of his pocket, And they both went weeping along.

But before I lose my lady fair, sir, I'll rather lose my life sae dear.’ 11 Then up bespak the second man, love, An aye he spake mair angrily, Saying, ‘Baith your life, and your lady fair, sir, This night shall wauk the wuds wi me.’ 12 ‘My lady fair, O I like her weel, sir, An O my life, but it lies me near!

I prithee tell to me;’ ‘I am a tanner's daughter,’ she said, ‘John Hobbes of Barneslee.’ 6 ‘And whither goest thou, pretty maide? Shall I be thy true love?’ ‘If thou art not afeard,’ she said, ‘My true love thou shalt prove.’ 7 ‘What should I feare?’ then he replied; ‘I am thy true love now;’ ‘I have two brethren, and their pride Would scorn such one as thou.’ 8 ‘That will we try,’ quoth Robin Hood; ‘I was not made their scorne; He, shed my blood to doe the[e] good, As sure as they were borne.’ 9 ‘My brothers are proude and fierce and strong;’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘the same, And if they offer thee to wrong, Theyle finde Ile play their game. 10 ‘Through the free forrest I can run, The king may not controll; They are but barking tanners' sons, To me they shall pay toll. 11 ‘And if not mine be sheepe and kine, I have cattle on my land; On venison eche day I may dine, Whiles they have none in hand.’ 12 These wordes had Robin Hood scarce spoke, When they two men did see, Come riding till their horses smoke: ‘My brothers both,’ cried shee. 13 Each had a good sword by his side, And furiouslie they rode To where they Robin Hood espied, That with the maiden stood. 14 ‘Flee hence, flee hence, away with speede!’ Cried she to Robin Hood, ‘For if thou stay, thoult surely bleede; I could not see thy blood.’ 15 ‘With us, false maiden, come away, And leave that outlawe bolde; Why fledst thou from thy home this day, And left thy father olde?’ 16 Robin stept backe but paces five, Unto a sturdie tree; ‘Ile fight whiles I am left alive; Stay thou, sweete maide, with mee.’ 17 He stood before, she stoode behinde, The brothers two drewe nie; ‘Our sister now to us resign, Or thou full sure shalt die.’ 18 Then cried the maide, ‘My brethren deare, With ye Ile freely wend, But harm not this young forrester, Noe ill doth he pretend.’ 19 ‘Stande up, sweete maide, I plight my troth; Fall thou not on thy knee; Ile force thy cruell brothers both To bend the knee to thee. 20 ‘Stand thou behinde this sturdie oke, I soone will quell their pride; Thoult see my sword with furie smoke, And in their hearts' blood died.’ 21 He set his backe against a tree, His foote against a stone; The first blow that he gave so free Cleft one man to the bone. 22 The tanners bold they fought right well, And it was one to two; But Robin did them both refell, All in the damsell's viewe. 23 The red blood ran from Robins brow, All downe unto his knee; ‘O holde your handes, my brethren now, I will goe backe with yee.’ 24 ‘Stand backe, stand backe, my pretty maide, Stand backe and let me fight; By sweete St. James be no[t] afraide But I will it requite.’ 25 Then Robin did his sword uplift, And let it fall againe; The oldest brothers head it cleft, Right through unto his braine. 26 ‘O hold thy hand, bolde forrester, Or ill may thee betide; Slay not my youngest brother here, He is my father's pride.’ 27 ‘Away, for I would scorne to owe, My life to the[e], false maide!’ The youngest cried, and aimd a blow That lit on Robin's head. 28 Then Robin leand against the tree, His life nie gone did seeme; His eyes did swim, he could not see The maiden start betweene. 29 It was not long ere Robin Hood Could welde his sword so bright; Upon his feete he firmly stood, And did renew the fight. 30 Untill the tanner scarce could heave His weapon in the aire; But Robin would not him bereave Of life, and left him there. 31 Then to the greenewood did he fly, And with him went the maide; For him she vowd that she would dye, He'd live for her, he said. 9 THE FAIR FLOWER OF NORTHUMBERLAND Jack of Newbury; or, The Ungrateful Knight and the Fair Flower of Northumberland THE FAIR FLOWER OF NORTHUMBERLAND—A a.

As the primrose spreads so sweetly 2 The eldest was baith tall and fair, But the youngest was beyond compare. 3 The midmost had a graceful mien, But the youngest lookd like beautie's queen. 4 The knight bowd low to a' the three, But to the youngest he bent his knee. 5 The ladie turned her head aside, The knight he woo'd her to be his bride. 6 The ladie blushd a rosy red, And sayd, ‘Sir knight, I'm too young to wed.’ 7 ‘O ladie fair, give me your hand, And I'll make you ladie of a' my land.’ 8 ‘Sir knight, ere ye my favor win, You maun get consent frae a' my kin.’ 9 He's got consent frae her parents dear, And likewise frae her sisters fair. 10 He's got consent frae her kin each one, But forgot to spiek to her brother John. 11 Now, when the wedding day was come, The knight would take his bonny bride home. 12 And many a lord and many a knight Came to behold that ladie bright. 13 And there was nae man that did her see, But wishd himself bridegroom to be. 14 Her father dear led her down the stair, And her sisters twain they kissd her there. 15 Her mother dear led her thro the closs, And her brother John set her on her horse. 16 She leand her oer the saddle-bow, To give him a kiss ere she did go. 17 He has taen a knife, baith lang and sharp, And stabbd that bonny bride to the heart. 18 She hadno ridden half thro the town, Until her heart's blude staind her gown. 19 ‘Ride softly on,’ says the best young man, ‘For I think our bonny bride looks pale and wan.’ 20 ‘O lead me gently up yon hill, And I'll there sit down, and make my will.’ 21 ‘O what will you leave to your father dear?’ ‘The silver-shod steed that brought me here.’ 22 ‘What will you leave to your mother dear?’ ‘My velvet pall and my silken gear.’ 23 ‘What will you leave to your sister Anne?’ ‘My silken scarf and my gowden fan.’ 24 ‘What will you leave to your sister Grace?’ ‘My bloody cloaths to wash and dress.’ 25 ‘What will you leave to your brother John?’ ‘The gallows-tree to hang him on.’ 26 ‘What will you leave to your brother John's wife?’ ‘The wilderness to end her life.’ 27 This ladie fair in her grave was laid, And many a mass was oer her said. 28 But it would have made your heart right sair, To see the bridegroom rive his haire.

Or does your steed . . . 16 ‘Or does the rain run in your glove?

And the goodly Queene Gueneuer! I canott her fforgett. 5 ‘I tell you lords in this hall, I hett you all heede, Except you be the more surer, is you for to dread.’ 6 He plucked out of his potewer, and longer wold not dwell, He pulled forth a pretty mantle, betweene two nut-shells. 7 ‘Haue thou here, King Arthure, haue thou heere of mee; Giue itt to thy comely queene, shapen as itt is alreadye. 8 ‘Itt shall neuer become that wiffe that hath once done amisse:’ Then euery knight in the kings court began to care for his. 9 Forth came dame Gueneuer, to the mantle shee her bed; The ladye shee was new-fangle, but yett shee was affrayd. 10 When shee had taken the mantle, shee stoode as she had beene madd; It was from the top to the toe as sheeres had itt shread. 11 One while was itt gaule, another while was itt greene; Another while was itt wadded; ill itt did her beseeme. 12 Another while was it blacke, and bore the worst hue; ‘By my troth,’ quoth King Arthur, ‘I thinke thou be not true.’ 13 Shee threw downe the mantle, that bright was of blee, Fast with a rudd redd to her chamber can shee flee. 14 Shee curst the weauer and the walker that clothe that had wrought, And bade a vengeance on his crowne that hither hath itt brought. 15 ‘I had rather be in a wood, vnder a greene tree, Then in King Arthurs court shamed for to bee.’ 16 Kay called forth his ladye, and bade her come neere; Saies, ‘Madam, and thou be guiltye, I pray thee hold thee there.’ 17 Forth came his ladye shortlye and anon, Boldlye to the mantle then is shee gone. 18 When she had tane the mantle, and cast it her about, Then was shee bare all aboue the buttocckes. 19 Then euery knight that was in the kings court Talked, laughed, and showted, full oft att that sport. 20 Shee threw downe the mantle, that bright was of blee, Ffast with a red rudd to her chamber can shee flee. 21 Forth came an old knight, pattering ore a creede, And he proferred to this little boy twenty markes to his meede, 22 And all the time of the Christmasse willinglye to ffeede; For why, this mantle might doe his wiffe some need. 23 When shee had tane the mantle, of cloth that was made, Shee had no more left on her but a tassell and a threed: Then euery knight in the kings court bade euill might shee speed. 24 Shee threw downe the mantle, that bright was of blee, And fast with a redd rudd to her chamber can shee flee. 25 Craddocke called forth his ladye, and bade her come in; Saith, ‘Winne this mantle, ladye, with a litle dinne. 26 ‘Winne this mantle, ladye, and it shalbe thine If thou neuer did amisse since thou wast mine.’ 27 Forth came Craddockes ladye shortlye and anon, But boldlye to the mantle then is shee gone. 28 When shee had tane the mantle, and cast itt her about, Vpp att her great toe itt began to crinkle and crowt; Shee said, ‘Bowe downe, mantle, and shame me not for nought. 29 ‘Once I did amisse, I tell you certainlye, When I kist Craddockes mouth vnder a greene tree, When I kist Craddockes mouth before he marryed mee.’ 30 When shee had her shreeuen, and her sines shee had tolde, The mantle stoode about her right as shee wold; 31 Seemelye of coulour, glittering like gold; Then euery knight in Arthurs court did her behold. 32 Then spake dame Gueneuer to Arthur our king: ‘She hath tane yonder mantle, not with wright but with wronge! 33 ‘See you not yonder woman that maketh her selfe soe clene? I haue seene tane out of her bedd of men fiueteene; 34 ‘Preists, clarkes, and wedded men, from her by-deene; Yett shee taketh the mantle, and maketh her-selfe cleane!’ 35 Then spake the litle boy that kept the mantle in hold; Sayes ‘King, chasten thy wiffe; of her words shee is to bold. 36 ‘Shee is a bitch and a witch, and a whore bold; King, in thine owne hall thou art a cuchold.’ 37 The litle boy stoode looking ouer a dore; He was ware of a wyld bore, wold haue werryed a man. 38 He pulld forth a wood kniffe, fast thither that he ran; He brought in the bores head, and quitted him like a man. 39 He brought in the bores head, and was wonderous bold; He said there was neuer a cucholds kniffe carue itt that cold. 40 Some rubbed their kniues vppon a whetstone; Some threw them vnder the table, and said they had none. 41 King Arthur and the child stood looking them vpon; All their kniues edges turned backe againe. 42 Craddoccke had a litle kniue of iron and of steele; He birtled the bores head wonderous weele, That euery knight in the kings court had a morssell. 43 The litle boy had a horne, of red gold that ronge; He said, ‘there was noe cuckolde shall drinke of my horne, But he shold itt sheede, either behind or beforne.’ 44 Some shedd on their shoulder, and some on their knee; He that cold not hitt his mouth put it in his eye; And he that was a cuckold, euery man might him see. 45 Craddoccke wan the horne and the bores head; His ladye wan the mantle vnto her meede; Euerye such a louely ladye, God send her well to speede! 30 KING ARTHUR AND KING CORNWALL KING ARTHUR AND KING CORNWALL Percy MS., p. 24.

28 ‘For the eyes that beene in his head, Thé glister as doth the gleed.’ ‘Now, by my faith,’ says noble King Arthur, ‘That is a well faire steed.’ 29 ‘Nobody say But one that's learned to speake.’ 30 Then King Arthur to his bed was brought, A greeiued man was hee; And soe were all his fellowes with him, From him thé thought neuer to flee. 31 Then take they did that lodly groome, And under the rub-chadler closed was hee, And he was set by King Arthurs bed-side, To heere theire talke and theire comunye; 32 That he might come forth, and make proclamation, Long before it was day; It was more for King Cornwalls pleasure, Then it was for King Arthurs pay. 33 And when King Arthur in his bed was laid, These were the words said hee: ‘Ile make mine avow to God, And alsoe to the Trinity, That Ile be the bane of Cornwall Kinge, Litle Brittaine or euer I see!’ 34 ‘It is an vnaduised vow,’ saies Gawaine the gay, ‘As ever king hard make I; But wee that beene fiue christian men, Of the christen faith are wee, And we shall fight against anoynted king And all his armorie.’ 35 And then bespake him noble Arthur, And these were the words said he: ‘Why, if thou be afraid, Sir Gawaine the gay, Goe home, and drinke wine in thine owne country.’ 36 And then bespake Sir Gawaine the gay, And these were the words said hee: ‘Nay, seeing you have made such a hearty vow, Heere another vow make will I. 37 ‘Ile make mine avow to God, And alsoe to the Trinity, That I will haue yonder faire lady To Litle Brittaine with mee. 38 ‘Ile hose her hourly to my heart, And with her Ile worke my will;’ 39 These were the words sayd hee: ‘Befor I wold wrestle with yonder feend, It is better be drowned in the sea.’ 40 And then bespake Sir Bredbeddle, And these were the words said he: ‘Why, I will wrestle with yon lodly feend, God, my gouernor thou wilt bee!’ 41 Then bespake him noble Arthur, And these were the words said he: ‘What weapons wilt thou haue, thou gentle knight? I pray thee tell to me.’ 42 He sayes, ‘Collen brand Ile haue in my hand, And a Millaine knife fast by me knee, And a Danish axe fast in my hands, That a sure weapon I thinke wilbe.’ 43 Then with his Collen brand that he had in his hand The bunge of that rub-chandler he burst in three; With that start out a lodly feend, With seuen heads, and one body. 44 The fyer towards the element flew, Out of his mouth, where was great plentie; The knight stoode in the middle and fought, That it was great ioy to see. 45 Till his Collaine brand brake in his hand, And his Millaine knife burst on his knee, And then the Danish axe burst in his hand first, That a sur weapon he thought shold be. 46 But now is the knight left without any weapons, And alacke! it was the more pitty; But a surer weapon then he had one, Had neuer lord in Christentye; And all was but one litle booke, He found it by the side of the sea. 47 He found it at the sea-side, Wrucked upp in a floode; Our Lord had written it with his hands, And sealed it with his bloode. 48 ‘That thou doe not s But ly still in that wall of stone, Till I haue beene with noble King Arthur, And told him what I haue done.’ 49 And when he came to the kings chamber, He cold of his curtesie: Says, ‘Sleepe you, wake you, noble King Arthur? And euer Iesus waken yee!’ 50 ‘Nay, I am not sleeping, I am waking,’ These were the words said hee; ‘Ffor thee I haue card; how hast thou fared? O gentle knight, let me see.’ 51 The knight wrought the king his booke, Bad him behold, reede and see; And euer he found it on the backside of the leafe As noble Arthur wold wish it to be. 52 And then bespake him King Arthur, ‘Alas! thow gentle knight, how may this be, That I might see him in the same licknesse That he stood vnto thee?’ 53 And then bespake him the Greene Knight, These were the words said hee: ‘If youle stand stifly in the battell stronge, For I haue won all the victory.’ 54 Then bespake him the king againe, And these were the words said hee: ‘If wee stand not stifly in this battell strong, Wee are worthy to be hanged all on a tree.’ 55 Then bespake him the Greene Knight, These were the words said he: Saies, ‘I doe coniure thee, thou fowle feend, In the same licknesse thou stood vnto me.’ 56 With that start out a lodly feend, With seuen heads, and one body; The fier towards the element flaugh, Out of his mouth, where was great plenty. 57 The knight stood in the middle p 58 they stood the space of an houre, I know not what they did. 59 And then bespake him the Greene Knight, And these were the words said he: Saith, ‘I coniure thee, thou fowle feend, That thou feitch downe the steed that we see.’ 60 And then forth is gone Burlow-beanie, As fast as he cold hie, And feitch he did that faire steed, And came againe by and by. 61 Then bespake him Sir Marramiles, And these were the words said hee: ‘Riding of this steed, brother Bredbeddle, The mastery belongs to me.’ 62 Marramiles tooke the steed to his hand, To ryd him he was full bold; He cold noe more make him goe Then a child of three yeere old. 63 He laid vppon him with heele and hand, With yard that was soe fell; ‘Helpe! brother Bredbeddle,’ says Marramile, ‘For I thinke he be the devill of hell. 64 ‘Helpe! brother Bredbeddle,’ says Marramile, ‘Helpe! for Christs pittye; Ffor without thy help, brother Bredbeddle, He will neuer be rydden for me.’ 65 Then bespake him Sir Bredbeddle, These were the words said he: ‘I coniure thee, thou Burlow-beane, Thou tell me how this steed was riddin in his country.’ 66 He saith, ‘there is a gold wand Stands in King Cornwalls study windowe; 67 ‘Let him take that wand in that window, And strike three strokes on that steed; And then he will spring forth of his hand As sparke doth out of gleede.’ 68 And then bespake him the Greene Knight, 69 A lowd blast he may blow then. 70 And then bespake Sir Bredebeddle, To the ffeend these words said hee: Says, ‘I coniure thee, thou Burlow-beanie, The powder-box thou feitch me.’ 71 Then forth is gone Burlow-beanie, As fast as he cold hie, And feich he did the powder-box, And came againe by and by. 72 Then Sir Tristeram tooke powder forth of that box, And blent it with warme sweet milke, And there put it vnto that horne, And swilled it about in that ilke. 73 Then he tooke the horne in his hand, And a lowd blast he blew; He rent the horne vp to the midst, All his ffellowes this thé knew. 74 Then bespake him the Greene Knight, These were the words said he: Saies, ‘I coniure thee, thou Burlow-beanie, That thou feitch me the sword that I see.’ 75 Then forth is gone Burlow-beanie, As fast as he cold hie, And feitch he did that faire sword, And came againe by and by. 76 Then bespake him Sir Bredbeddle, To the king these words said he: ‘Take this sword in thy hand, thou noble King Arthur, For the vowes sake that thou made Ile giue it th[ee,] And goe strike off King Cornewalls head, In bed were he doth lye.’ 77 Then forth is gone noble King Arthur, As fast as he cold hye, And strucken he hath off King Cornwalls head, And came againe by and by. 78 He put the head vpon a swords point, 31 THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAIN THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAIN Percy MS., p. 46.

For if thou knew my sighing soe deepe, Thou wold not meruaile att all. 9 ‘Ffor when I came to Tearne Wadling, A bold barron there I fand, With a great club vpon his backe, Standing stiffe and strong. 10 ‘And he asked me wether I wold fight Or from him I shold begone, O[r] else I must him a ransome pay, And soe depart him from. 11 ‘To fight with him I saw noe cause; Methought it was not meet; For he was stiffe and strong with-all, His strokes were nothing sweete. 12 ‘Therefor this is my ransome, Gawaine, I ought to him to pay; I must come againe, as I am sworne, Vpon the New Yeers day; 13 ‘And I must bring him word what thing it is 14 Then king Arthur drest him for to ryde, In one soe rich array, Toward the fore-said Tearne Wadling, That he might keepe his day. 15 And as he rode over a more, Hee see a lady where shee sate Betwixt an oke and a greene hollen; She was cladd in red scarlett. 16 Then there as shold haue stood her mouth, Then there was sett her eye; The other was in her forhead fast, The way that she might see. 17 Her nose was crooked and turnd outward, Her mouth stood foule a-wry; A worse formed lady than shee was, Neuer man saw with his eye. 18 To halch vpon him, King Arthur, This lady was full faine, But King Arthur had forgott his lesson, What he shold say againe. 19 ‘What knight art thou,’ the lady sayd, ‘That will not speak to me? Of me be thou nothing dismayd, Tho I be vgly to see. 20 ‘For I haue halched you curteouslye, And you will not me againe; Yett I may happen Sir Knight,’ shee said, ‘To ease thee of thy paine.’ 21 ‘Giue thou ease me, lady,’ he said, ‘Or helpe me any thing, Thou shalt have gentle Gawaine, my cozen, And marry him with a ring.’ 22 ‘Why, if I help thee not, thou noble King Arthur, Of thy owne hearts desiringe, Of gentle Gawaine 23 And when he came to the Tearne Wadling, The baron there cold he finde, With a great weapon on his backe, Standing stiffe and stronge. 24 And then he tooke King Arthurs letters in his hands, And away he cold them fling, And then he puld out a good browne sword, And cryd himselfe a king. 25 And he sayd, I have thee and thy land, Arthur, To doe as it pleaseth me, For this is not thy ransome sure, Therfore yeeld thee to me. 26 And then bespoke him noble Arthur, And bad him hold his hand: ‘And giue me leaue to speake my mind In defence of all my land.’ 27 He said, As I came over a more, I see a lady where shee sate Betweene an oke and a green hollen; Shee was clad in red scarlett. 28 And she says a woman will haue her will, And this is all her cheef desire: Doe me right, as thou art a baron of sckill, This is thy ransome and all thy hyer. 29 He sayes, An early vengeance light on her!

Shee eat him [a'] up, skin an bane, Left naething but hide an hair. 9 ‘Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry, Mair meat ye gi to me!’ ‘An what meat's in this house, lady, An what ha I to gi?’ ‘O ye do kill your good gray-hounds, An ye bring them a' to me.’ 10 O whan he slew his good gray-hounds, Wow but his heart was sair! She eat them a' up, skin an bane, Left naething but hide an hair. 11 ‘Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry, Mair meat ye gi to me!’ ‘An what meat's i this house, lady, An what ha I to gi?’ ‘O ye do kill your gay gos-hawks, An ye bring them here to me.’ 12 O whan he slew his gay gos-hawks, Wow but his heart was sair! She eat them a' up, skin an bane, Left naething but feathers bare. 13 ‘Some drink, some drink, now, King Henry, Some drink ye bring to me!’ ‘O what drink's i this house, lady, That you're nae welcome ti?’ ‘O ye sew up your horse's hide, An bring in a drink to me.’ 14 And he's sewd up the bloody hide, A puncheon o wine put in; She drank it a' up at a waught, Left na ae drap ahin. 15 ‘A bed, a bed, now, King Henry, A bed you mak to me! For ye maun pu the heather green, An mak a bed to me.’ 16 O pu'd has he the heather green, An made to her a bed, An up has he taen his gay mantle, An oer it has he spread. 17 ‘Tak aff your claiths, now, King Henry, An lye down by my side!’ ‘O God forbid,’ says King Henry, ‘That ever the like betide; That ever the fiend that wons in hell Shoud streak down by my side.’ 18 Whan night was gane, and day was come, An the sun shone throw the ha, The fairest lady that ever was seen Lay atween him an the wa. 19 ‘O well is me!’ says King Henry, ‘How lang'll this last wi me?’ Then out it spake that fair lady, ‘Even till the day you dee. 20 ‘For I've met wi mony a gentle knight That's gien me sic a fill, But never before wi a courteous knight That ga me a' my will.’ 33 KEMPY KAY Kempy Kay KEMPY KAY—A Pitcairn's MSS, II, 125, as taken down by Mr Pitcairn from the singing of his aunt, Mrs Gammell, who had learned it in the neighborhood of Kincaid, Stirlingshire, when a child, or about 1770.

I'm sure you was once the fairest creature That ever the sun shined on. 5 ‘Gae scrape yoursel, and gae scart yoursel, And mak your brucket face clean, For the wooers are to be here to nighte, And your body's to be seen.’ 6 Sae they scrapit her, and they scartit her, Like the face of an aussy pan; Syne in cam Kempy Kay himself, A clever and tall young man. 7 His teeth they were like tether-sticks, His nose was three fit lang, Between his shouthers was ells three, And tween his eyne a span. 8 He led his dochter by the hand, His dochter ben brought he: ‘O is she not the fairest lass That's in great Christendye?’ 9 Ilka hair intil her head Was like a heather-cowe, And ilka louse anunder it Was like a bruckit ewe. 10 She had tauchy teeth and kaily lips, And wide lugs, fou o hair; Her pouches fou o peasemeal-daighe A' hinging down her spare. 11 Ilka eye intil her head Was like a rotten plumbe, And down browed was the queyne, And sairly did she gloom. 12 Ilka nail upon her hand Was like an iron rake, And ilka tooth intil her head Was like a tether-stake. 13 She gied to him a gravat, O the auld horse's sheet, And he gied her a gay gold ring, O the auld couple-root.

Kempion KEMP OWYNE—B a. Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 29. b. Scott's Minstrelsy, II, 93, 1802, from William Tytler's Brown MS., No 9, “with corrections from a recited fragment.” 1 ‘Come here, come here, you freely feed, An lay your head low on my knee; The hardest weird I will you read That eer war read to a lady. 2 ‘O meikle dollour sall you dree, An ay the sat seas oer ye ['s] swim; An far mair dollour sall ye dree On Eastmuir craigs, or ye them clim. 3 ‘I wot ye's be a weary wight, An releived sall ye never be Till Kempion, the kingis son, Come to the craig and thrice kiss thee.’ 4 O meickle dollour did she dree, An ay the sat seas oer she swam; An far mair dollour did she dree On Eastmuir craigs, or them she clam; An ay she cried for Kempion, Gin he would come till her han. 5 Now word has gane to Kempion That sich a beast was in his lan, An ay be sure she would gae mad Gin she gat nae help frae his han. 6 ‘Now by my sooth,’ says Kempion, ‘This fiery beast I['ll] gang to see;’ ‘An by my sooth,’ says Segramour, ‘My ae brother, I'll gang you wi.’ 7 O biggit ha they a bonny boat, An they hae set her to the sea, An Kempion an Segramour The fiery beast ha gane to see: A mile afore they reachd the shore, I wot she gard the red fire flee. 8 ‘O Segramour, keep my boat afloat, An lat her no the lan so near; For the wicked beast she'll sure gae mad, An set fire to the land an mair.’ 9 ‘O out o my stye I winna rise — An it is na for the fear o thee — Till Kempion, the kingis son, Come to the craig an thrice kiss me.’ 10 He's louted him oer the Eastmuir craig, An he has gien her kisses ane; Awa she gid, an again she came, The fieryest beast that ever was seen. 11 ‘O out o my stye I winna rise — An it is na for fear o thee — Till Kempion, the kingis son, Come to the craig an thrice kiss me.’ 12 He louted him oer the Eastmuir craig, An he has gien her kisses twa; Awa she gid, an again she came, The fieryest beast that ever you saw. 13 ‘O out o my stye I winna rise — An it is na for fear o ye— Till Kempion, the kingis son, Come to the craig an thrice kiss me.’ 14 He's louted him oer the Eastmuir craig, An he has gien her kisses three; Awa she gid, an again she came, The fairest lady that ever coud be. 15 ‘An by my sooth,’ say[s] Kempion, ‘My ain true love — for this is she — O was it wolf into the wood, Or was it fish intill the sea, Or was it man, or wile woman, My true love, that misshapit thee?’ 16 ‘It was na wolf into the wood, Nor was it fish into the sea, But it was my stepmother, An wae an weary mot she be. 17 ‘O a heavier weird light her upon Than ever fell on wile woman; Her hair's grow rough, an her teeth's grow lang, An on her four feet sal she gang. 18 ‘Nane sall tack pitty her upon, But in Wormie's Wood she sall ay won, An relieved sall she never be, Till St Mungo come oer the sea.’ 35 ALLISON GROSS Allison Gross Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 40. 1 O Allison Gross, that lives in yon towr, The ugliest witch i the north country, Has trysted me ae day up till her bowr, An monny fair speech she made to me. 2 She stroaked my head, an she kembed my hair, An she set me down saftly on her knee; Says, Gin ye will be my lemman so true, Sae monny braw things as I woud you gi. 3 She showd me a mantle o red scarlet, Wi gouden flowrs an fringes fine; Says, Gin ye will be my lemman so true, This goodly gift it sal be thine. 4 ‘Awa, awa, ye ugly witch, Haud far awa, an lat me be; I never will be your lemman sae true, An I wish I were out o your company.’ 5 She neist brought a sark o the saftest silk, Well wrought wi pearles about the ban; Says, Gin you will be my ain true love, This goodly gift you sal comman. 6 She showd me a cup of the good red gold, Well set wi jewls sae fair to see; Says, Gin you will be my lemman sae true, This goodly gift I will you gi. 7 ‘Awa, awa, ye ugly witch, Had far awa, and lat me be; For I woudna ance kiss your ugly mouth For a' the gifts that ye coud gi.’ 8 She's turnd her right and roun about, An thrice she blaw on a grass-green horn, An she sware by the meen and the stars abeen, That she'd gar me rue the day I was born. 9 Then out has she taen a silver wand, An she's turnd her three times roun an roun; She's mutterd sich words till my strength it faild, An I fell down senceless upon the groun. 10 She's turnd me into an ugly worm, And gard me toddle about the tree; An ay, on ilka Saturdays night, My sister Maisry came to me, 11 Wi silver bason an silver kemb, To kemb my heady upon her knee; But or I had kissd her ugly mouth, I'd rather a toddled about the tree. 12 But as it fell out on last Hallow-even, When the seely court was ridin by, The queen lighted down on a gowany bank, Nae far frae the tree where I wont to lye. 13 She took me up in her milk-white han, An she's stroakd me three times oer her knee; She chang'd me again to my ain proper shape, An I nae mair maun toddle about the tree. 36 THE LAILY WORM AND THE MACHREL OF THE SEA THE LAILY WORM AND THE MACHREL OF THE SEA—A Though Skene has rendered this ballad with reasonable fidelity, for an editor, it shall, on account of its interest, be given as it stands in the old lady's MS., where it is No 2. 1 ‘I was bat seven year alld Fan my mider she did dee, My father marrëd the ae warst woman The wardle did ever see. 2 ‘For she has made me the lailly worm That lays att the fitt of the tree, An o my sister Meassry The machrel of the sea. 3 ‘An every Saterday att noon The machrl comes ea to me, An she takes my laylë head, An lays it on her knee, An keames it we a silver kemm, An washes it in the sea. 4 ‘Seven knights ha I slain Sane I lay att the fitt of the tree;

The Hagg Worm THE LAILY WORM AND THE MACHREL OF THE SEA—B Obtained from an old woman by Captain E. Grow. 1 Bambrough Castle's a bonny place, Built on a marble stone, But long, long did the lady look Eer her father came home. 2 She knotted the keys upon a string, And with her she has them taen; She cast them oer her left shoulder, And to the gates she is gaen. 3 It fell out on a day the king Brought his new lady home, And all the lordling[s] in his realm To welcome them did come. 4 ‘You'r welcome, father,’ the lady cries, ‘To your halls and your towers, And so are you, good queen,’ said she, ‘For all that's here is yours.’ 5 ‘O who is this,’ said the queen, ‘That welcomes me so high?’ Up then spake a greyhaird man, An ill dead may he dee! 'Tis the kinges aie daughter, The flower of the North Country. 6 ‘O woe betyde the[e], greyhaired man, An ill dead may thou dee! Had she been fairer then she is, You might have excepted me. 7 ‘I'll liken her to a laidley worm, That warps about the stone, And not till Child of Wynd comes back Shall she again be wonne.’ 8 The lady stood at her bower-door, A loud laughter took she: ‘I hope your prayers will have no pith; You took not God with ye.’ 9 She calld on her waiting-maid— They calld her Dorothy— ‘The coffer that my gold lies in, I leave to thee the key. 10 ‘Her hellish spells seize on my heart, And quick will alter me; For eer the seting sun is down A laidler worm I'll be.’ 11 Word's gone east, and word's gone west, And word's gone oer the sea, There's a laidler worm in Spindlestone Heughs Will destroy the North Countree. 12 For seven miles east and seven miles west, And seven miles north and south, Nea blade of grass or corn will grow, For the venom of her mouth. 13 To this day may be seen the cave This monsterous worm embowered, And the stone trough where seven cows' milk She every day devoured. 14 Word's gone east and word's gone west, Word oer the sea did go; The Child of Wynd got wit of it, Which filld his heart with woe. 15 ‘I have no sister but barely one, I fear fair Margery! I wish I was at Spindlestone Heughs, This laidler worm to see.’ 16 Up then spoke his eldest brother, An angry man was he: O thou art young, far over young, To sail the stormy sea. 17 ‘Peace, brother,’ said the Child of Wynd, ‘Dear brother, let me be; For when we come to danger dire, I must fight when you will flee. 18 ‘O let us build a bonny ship, And set her in the sea; The sails shall be of silken twine, The masts of rowon-tree.’ 19 They built a ship, the wind and tyde Drave them along the deep; At last they saw a stately tower, On the rock high and steep. 20 The sea was smooth, the sky was clear; As they approached nigher, King Ida's castle well they knew, And the banks of Balmburghshire. 21 The queen lookd thro her bower-window, To see what she coud see, And she espied a gallant ship Come sailing along the sea. 22 She calld on her witch-women To sink them in the main; They hoisted up their silken sails, And to Warren bridge they gane. 23 The worm lept up, the worm lept down, She plaited round the stane, And as the ship came to the land She banged them off again. 24 The Child leapd in the shallow water That flows oer Budle sand, And when he drew his berry-brown sword She suffered them to land. 25 When they came to Bamburg castle They tirled at the ring; ‘Who's that,’ said the proud porter, ‘That woud so fain be in?’ 26 ‘'Tis the king's son and Child of Wynd, Who have long been oer the sea; We come to see our sister dear, The peirless Margery.’ 27 ‘Heigh a ween, and Oh a ween! A ween, a woe-ses me! She's a laidler worm at Spindlestone Heughs, These seven years and three.’ 28 They highed them stright to Spindleston Heughs— Grief added to their speed— Where out she came a laidler worm, And strack their hearts with dread. 29 The Child drew out his berry-brown sword, And waved it oer her head, And cried, If thou 30 ‘O quit thy sword, and bend thy bow, And give me kisses three; For if I am not wonne eer the sun goes down, Wonne will I never be.’ 31 He quit his sword, he bent his bow, He gave her kisses three; She threw out her fireballs, And fiercely made them flee. 32 In she went, and out she came, A laidley ask was she: ‘Oh, tho I am a laidley ask, No harm I'll do to thee. 33 ‘Oh quit thy sword, and bend thy bow, And give me kisses three; For if I am not wonne eer the sun goes down, Wonne will I never be.’ 34 He quit his sword, he bent his bow, And gave her kisses three; But she threw out her fireballs, And fiercely made them flee. 35 In she went, and out she came, A laidley adder was she; [‘Oh, tho I am a laidley adder, No harm I'll do to thee.] 36 ‘Oh quit thy sword, and bend thy bow, And give me kisses three; [For if I am not wonne eer the sun goes down, Wonne will I never be.’] 37 He quit his sword, he bent his bow, He gave her kisses three; She crept into the cave a snake, But stept out a lady. 38 ‘O quit thy sword, unbend thy bow, And give me kisses three; For tho I am a lady fair, I am to modesty.’ 39 He took his mantle from his back, And wrapd his sister in, And thei'r away to Bamburg Castle, As fast as they coud winne. 40 His absence and her reptile form The king had long deplored, But now rejoiced to see them both Again to him restored. 41 The queen he sought, who when he found All quailed and sore affraid, Because she knew her power must yield To Child of Wynd, who said: 42 ‘O woe be to the[e], wicked woman, An ill deed may thou dee! As thou my sister likened, So likened thou shalt be. 43 ‘I change thy body to a toad, That on the earth doth wend, And wonne, wonne shalt thou never be Untill the world doth end!’ 44 Now on the ground, near Ida's tower, She crawls a loathsome toad, And venom spits on every maid She meets upon the road. 37 THOMAS RYMER Thomas Rymer and Queen of Elfland THOMAS RYMER—A Alexander Fraser Tytler's Brown MS., No 1: Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 7. 1 True Thomas lay oer yond grassy bank, And he beheld a ladie gay, A ladie that was brisk and bold, Come riding oer the fernie brae. 2 Her skirt was of the grass-green silk, Her mantel of the velvet fine, At ilka tett of her horse's mane Hung fifty silver bells and nine. 3 True Thomas he took off his hat, And bowed him low down till his knee: ‘All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven! For your peer on earth I never did see.’ 4 ‘O no, O no, True Thomas,’ she says, ‘That name does not belong to me; I am but the queen of fair Elfland, And I'm come here for to visit thee. 5 ‘But ye maun go wi me now, Thomas, True Thomas, ye maun go wi me, For ye maun serve me seven years, Thro weel or wae as may chance to be.’ 6 She turned about her milk-white steed, And took True Thomas up behind, And aye wheneer her bridle rang, The steed flew swifter than the wind. 7 For forty days and forty nights He wade thro red blude to the knee, And he saw neither sun nor moon, But heard the roaring of the sea. 8 O they rade on, and further on, Until they came to a garden green: ‘Light down, light down, ye ladie free, Some of that fruit let me pull to thee.’ 9 ‘O no, O no, True Thomas,’ she says, ‘That fruit maun not be touched by thee, For a' the plagues that are in hell Light on the fruit of this countrie. 10 ‘But I have a loaf here in my lap, Likewise a bottle of claret wine, And now ere we go farther on, We'll rest a while, and ye may dine.’ 11 When he had eaten and drunk his fill, ‘Lay down your head upon my knee,’ The lady sayd, ‘ere we climb yon hill, And I will show you fairlies three. 12 ‘O see not ye yon narrow road, So thick beset wi thorns and briers? That is the path of righteousness, Tho after it but few enquires. 13 ‘And see not ye that braid braid road, That lies across yon lillie leven? That is the path of wickedness, Tho some call it the road to heaven. 14 ‘And see not ye that bonny road, Which winds about the fernie brae? That is the road to fair Elfland, Whe[re] you and I this night maun gae. 15 ‘But Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue, Whatever you may hear or see, For gin ae word you should chance to speak, You will neer get back to your ain countrie.’ 16 He has gotten a coat of the even cloth, And a pair of shoes of velvet green, And till seven years were past and gone True Thomas on earth was never seen. Thomas the Rhymer THOMAS RYMER—B Campbell MSS, II, 83. 1 As Thomas lay on Huntlie banks— A wat a weel bred man was he— And there he spied a lady fair, Coming riding down by the Eildon tree. 2 The horse she rode on was dapple gray, And in her hand she held bells nine; I thought I heard this fair lady say These fair siller bells they should a' be mine. 3 It's Thomas even forward went, And lootit low down on his knee: ‘Weel met thee save, my lady fair, For thou'rt the flower o this countrie.’ 4 ‘O no, O no, Thomas,’ she says, ‘O no, O no, that can never be, For I'm but a lady of an unco land, Comd out a hunting, as ye may see. 5 ‘O harp and carp, Thomas,’ she says, ‘O harp and carp, and go wi me; It's be seven years, Thomas, and a day, Or you see man or woman in your ain countrie.’ 6 It's she has rode, and Thomas ran, Until they cam to yon water clear; He's coosten off his hose and shon, And he's wooden the water up to the knee. 7 It's she has rode, and Thomas ran, Until they cam to yon garden green; He's put up his hand for to pull down ane, For the lack o food he was like to tyne. 8 ‘Hold your hand, Thomas,’ she says, ‘Hold your hand, that must not be; It was a' that cursed fruit o thine Beggared man and woman in your countrie. 9 ‘But I have a loaf and a soup o wine, And ye shall go and dine wi me; And lay yer head down in my lap, And I will tell ye farlies three. 10 ‘It's dont ye see yon broad broad way, That leadeth down by yon skerry fell? It's ill's the man that dothe thereon gang, For it leadeth him straight to the gates o hell. 11 ‘It's dont ye see yon narrow way, That leadeth down by yon lillie lea? It's weel's the man that doth therein gang, For it leads him straight to the heaven hie.’ 12 It's when she cam into the hall— I wat a weel bred man was he— They've asked him question[s], one and all, But he answered none but that fair ladie. 13 O they speerd at her where she did him get, And she told them at the Eildon tree; Thomas the Rhymer THOMAS RYMER—C Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, II, 251, ed. 1802. 1 True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank, A ferlie he spied wi' his ee, And there he saw a lady bright, Come riding down by the Eildon Tree. 2 Her shirt was o the grass-green silk, Her mantle o the velvet fyne, At ilka tett of her horse's mane Hang fifty siller bells and nine. 3 True Thomas, he pulld aff his cap, And louted low down to his knee: ‘All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven! For thy peer on earth I never did see.’ 4 ‘O no, O no, Thomas,’ she said, ‘That name does not belang to me; I am but the queen of fair Elfland, That am hither come to visit thee. 5 ‘Harp and carp, Thomas,’ she said, ‘Harp and carp along wi me, And if ye dare to kiss my lips, Sure of your bodie I will be.’ 6 ‘Betide me weal, betide me woe, That weird shall never daunton me;’ Syne he has kissed her rosy lips, All underneath the Eildon Tree. 7 ‘Now, ye maun go wi me,’ she said, ‘True Thomas, ye maun go wi me, And ye maun serve me seven years, Thro weal or woe, as may chance to be.’ 8 She mounted on her milk-white steed, She's taen True Thomas up behind, And aye wheneer her bridle rung, The steed flew swifter than the wind. 9 O they rade on, and farther on— The steed gaed swifter than the wind— Untill they reached a desart wide, And living land was left behind. 10 ‘Light down, light down, now, True Thomas, And lean your head upon my knee; Abide and rest a little space, And I will shew you ferlies three. 11 ‘O see ye not yon narrow road, So thick beset with thorns and briers? That is the path of righteousness, Tho after it but few enquires. 12 ‘And see not ye that braid braid road, That lies across that lily leven? That is the path of wickedness, Tho some call it the road to heaven. 13 ‘And see not ye that bonny road, That winds about the fernie brae? That is the road to fair Elfland, Where thou and I this night maun gae. 14 ‘But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue, Whatever ye may hear or see, For, if you speak word in Elflyn land, Ye'll neer get back to your ain countrie.’ 15 O they rade on, and farther on, And they waded thro rivers aboon the knee, And they saw neither sun nor moon, But they heard the roaring of the sea. 16 It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern light, And they waded thro red blude to the knee; For a' the blude that's shed on earth Rins thro the springs o that countrie. 17 Syne they came on to a garden green, And she pu'd an apple frae a tree: ‘Take this for thy wages, True Thomas, It will give the tongue that can never lie.’ 18 ‘My tongue is mine ain,’ True Thomas said; ‘A gudely gift ye wad gie to me! I neither dought to buy nor sell, At fair or tryst where I may be. 19 ‘I dought neither speak to prince or peer, Nor ask of grace from fair ladye:’ ‘Now hold thy peace,’ the lady said, ‘For as I say, so must it be.’ 20 He has gotten a coat of the even cloth, And a pair of shoes of velvet green, And till seven years were gane and past True Thomas on earth was never seen. 38 THE WEE WEE MAN The Wee Wee Man THE WEE WEE MAN—A Herd's MSS, I, 153, Herd's Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 95. 1 As I was wa'king all alone, Between a water and a wa, And there I spy'd a wee wee man, And he was the least that ere I saw. 2 His legs were scarce a shathmont's length, And thick and thimber was his thigh; Between his brows there was a span, And between his shoulders there was three. 3 He took up a meikle stane, And he flang't as far as I could see; Though I had been a Wallace wight, I couldna liften't to my knee. 4 ‘O wee wee man, but thou be strang! O tell me where thy dwelling be?’ ‘My dwelling's down at yon bonny bower; O will you go with me and see?’ 5 On we lap, and awa we rade, Till we came to yon bonny green; We lighted down for to bait our horse, And out there came a lady fine. 6 Four and twenty at her back, And they were a' clad out in green; Though the King of Scotland had been there, The warst o them might hae been his queen. 7 On we lap, and awa we rade, Till we came to yon bonny ha, Whare the roof was o the beaten gould, And the floor was o the cristal a'. 8 When we came to the stair-foot, Ladies were dancing, jimp and sma, But in the twinkling of an eye, My wee wee man was clean awa.

And O where may your dwelling be?’ ‘It's down in to yon bonnie glen; Gin ye dinna believe, ye can come and see.’ 5 And we rade on, and we sped on, Till we cam to yon bonny glen, And there we lichted and louted in, And there we saw a dainty dame. 6 There was four and twenty wating on her, And ilka ane was clad in green, And he had been the king of fair Scotland, The warst o them micht hae been his queen. 7 There war pipers playing on ilka stair, And ladies dancing in ilka ha, But before ye coud hae sadd what was that, The house and wee manie was awa.

Or why comes thou to Carterhaugh Withoutten my command? 7 ‘Carterhaugh, it is my ain, My daddie gave it me; I'll come and gang by Carterhaugh, And ask nae leave at thee.’ 8 Janet has kilted her green kirtle A little aboon her knee, And she has snooded her yellow hair A little aboon her bree, And she is to her father's ha, As fast as she can hie. 9 Four and twenty ladies fair Were playing at the ba, And out then cam the fair Janet, Ance the flower amang them a'. 10 Four and twenty ladies fair Were playing at the chess, And out then cam the fair Janet, As green as onie glass. 11 Out then spak an auld grey knight, Lay oer the castle wa, And says, Alas, fair Janet, for thee But we'll be blamed a'. 12 ‘Haud your tongue, ye auld fac'd knight, Some ill death may ye die! Father my bairn on whom I will, I'll father nane on thee.’ 13 Out then spak her father dear, And he spak meek and mild; ‘And ever alas, sweet Janet,’ he says, ‘I think thou gaes wi child.’ 14 ‘If that I gae wi child, father, Mysel maun bear the blame; There's neer a laird about your ha Shall get the bairn's name. 15 ‘If my love were an earthly knight, As he's an elfin grey, I wad na gie my ain true-love For nae lord that ye hae. 16 ‘The steed that my true-love rides on Is lighter than the wind; Wi siller he is shod before, Wi burning gowd behind.’ 17 Janet has kilted her green kirtle A little aboon her knee, And she has snooded her yellow hair A little aboon her bree, And she's awa to Carterhaugh, As fast as she can hie. 18 When she cam to Carterhaugh, Tam Lin was at the well, And there she fand his steed standing, But away was himsel. 19 She had na pu'd a double rose, A rose but only twa, Till up then started young Tam Lin, Says Lady, thou pu's nae mae. 20 Why pu's thou the rose, Janet, Amang the groves sae green, And a' to kill the bonie babe That we gat us between? 21 ‘O tell me, tell me, Tam Lin,’ she says, ‘For's sake that died on tree, If eer ye was in holy chapel, Or christendom did see?’ 22 ‘Roxbrugh he was my grandfather, Took me with him to bide, And ance it fell upon a day That wae did me betide. 23 ‘And ance it fell upon a day, A cauld day and a snell, When we were frae the hunting come, That frae my horse I fell; The Queen o Fairies she caught me, In yon green hill to dwell. 24 ‘And pleasant is the fairy land, But, an eerie tale to tell, Ay at the end of seven years We pay a tiend to hell; I am sae fair and fu o flesh, I'm feard it be mysel. 25 ‘But the night is Halloween, lady, The morn is Hallowday; Then win me, win me, an ye will, For weel I wat ye may. 26 ‘Just at the mirk and midnight hour The fairy folk will ride, And they that wad their true-love win, At Miles Cross they maun bide.’ 27 ‘But how shall I thee ken, Tam Lin, Or how my true-love know, Amang sae mony unco knights The like I never saw?’ 28 ‘O first let pass the black, lady, And syne let pass the brown, But quickly run to the milk-white steed, Pu ye his rider down. 29 ‘For I'll ride on the milk-white steed, And ay nearest the town; Because I was an earthly knight They gie me that renown. 30 ‘My right hand will be glovd, lady, My left hand will be bare, Cockt up shall my bonnet be, And kaimd down shall my hair, And thae's the takens I gie thee, Nae doubt I will be there. 31 ‘They'll turn me in your arms, lady, Into an esk and adder; But hold me fast, and fear me not, I am your bairn's father. 32 ‘They'll turn me to a bear sae grim, And then a lion bold; But hold me fast, and fear me not, As ye shall love your child. 33 ‘Again they'll turn me in your arms To a red het gaud of airn; But hold me fast, and fear me not, I'll do to you nae harm. 34 ‘And last they'll turn me in your arms Into the burning gleed; Then throw me into well water, O throw me in wi speed. 35 ‘And then I'll be your ain true-love, I'll turn a naked knight; Then cover me wi your green mantle, And cover me out o sight.’ 36 Gloomy, gloomy was the night, And eerie was the way, As fair Jenny in her green mantle To Miles Cross she did gae. 37 About the middle o the night She heard the bridles ring; This lady was as glad at that As any earthly thing. 38 First she let the black pass by, And syne she let the brown; But quickly she ran to the milk-white steed, And pu'd the rider down. 39 Sae weel she minded whae he did say, And young Tam Lin did win; Syne coverd him wi her green mantle, As blythe's a bird in spring. 40 Out then spak the Queen o Fairies, Out of a bush o broom: ‘Them that has gotten young Tam Lin Has gotten a stately groom.’ 41 Out then spak the Queen o Fairies, And an angry woman was she: ‘Shame betide her ill-far'd face, And an ill death may she die, For she's taen awa the boniest knight In a' my companie. 42 ‘But had I kend, Tam Lin,’ she says, ‘What now this night I see, I wad hae taen out thy twa grey een, And put in twa een o tree.’ Young Tom Line TAM LIN—B Glenriddell's MSS, vol. xi, No 17. 1 I forbid ye, maidens a', That wear goud on your gear, To come and gae by Carterhaugh, For young Tom Line is there. 2 There's nane that gaes by Carterhaugh But they leave him a wad, Either their things or green mantles, Or else their maidenhead. 3 But Janet has kilted her green kirtle A little above her knee, And she has broded her yellow hair A little above her bree, And she has gaen for Carterhaugh, As fast as she can hie. 4 When she came to Carterhaugh Tom Line was at the well, And there she fand his steed standing, But away was himsell. 5 She hadna pu'd a double rose, A rose but only twae, Till up then started young Tom Line, Says, Lady, thou's pu nae mae. 6 Why pu's thou the rose, Janet?

Or why come ye to Chaster's wood Without the leave of me?’ 6 ‘O I will pull the flowers,’ she said, ‘Or I will break the tree, For Chaster's wood it is my own, I'll no ask leave at thee.’ 7 He took her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass green sleeve, And laid her low down on the flowers, At her he asked no leave. 8 The lady blushed, and sourly frowned, And she did think great shame; Says, ‘If you are a gentleman, You will tell me your name.’ 9 ‘First they did call me Jack,’ he said, ‘And then they called me John, But since I lived in the fairy court Tomlin has always been my name. 10 ‘So do not pluck that flower, lady, That has these pimples gray; They would destroy the bonny babe That we've got in our play.’ 11 ‘O tell me, Tomlin,’ she said, ‘And tell it to me soon, Was you ever at good church-door, Or got you christendoom?’ 12 ‘O I have been at good church-door, And aff her yetts within; I was the Laird of Foulis's son, The heir of all this land. 13 ‘But it fell once upon a day, As hunting I did ride, As I rode east and west yon hill There woe did me betide. 14 ‘O drowsy, drowsy as I was! Dead sleep upon me fell; The Queen of Fairies she was there, And took me to hersell. 15 ‘The Elfins is a pretty place, In which I love to dwell, But yet at every seven years' end The last here goes to hell; And as I am ane o flesh and blood, I fear the next be mysell. 16 ‘The morn at even is Halloween; Our fairy court will ride, Throw England and Scotland both, Throw al the world wide; And if ye would me borrow, At Rides Cross ye may bide. 17 ‘You may go into the Miles Moss, Between twelve hours and one; Take holy water in your hand, And cast a compass round. 18 ‘The first court that comes along, You'll let them all pass by; The next court that comes along, Salute them reverently. 19 ‘The next court that comes along Is clad in robes of green, And it's the head court of them all, For in it rides the queen. 20 ‘And I upon a milk-white steed, With a gold star in my crown; Because I am an earthly man I'm next to the queen in renown. 21 ‘Then seize upon me with a spring, Then to the ground I'll fa, And then you'll hear a rueful cry That Tomlin is awa. 22 ‘Then I'll grow in your arms two Like to a savage wild; But hold me fast, let me not go, I'm father of your child. 23 ‘I'll grow into your arms two Like an adder or a snake; But hold me fast, let me not go, I'll be your earthly maick. 24 ‘I'll grow into your arms two Like iron in strong fire; But hold me fast, let me not go, Then you'll have your desire.’ 25 She rid down to Miles Cross, Between twelve hours and one, Took holy water in her hand, And cast a compass round. 26 The first court that came along, She let them all pass by; The next court that came along Saluted reverently. 27 The next court that came along Were clad in robes of green, When Tomlin, on a milk-white steed, She saw ride with the queen. 28 She seized him in her arms two, He to the ground did fa, And then she heard a ruefull cry ‘Tomlin is now awa.’ 29 He grew into her arms two Like to a savage wild; She held him fast, let him not go, The father of her child. 30 He grew into her arms two Like an adder or a snake; She held him fast, let him not go, He was her earthly maick. 31 He grew into her arms two Like iron in hot fire; She held him fast, let him not go, He was her heart's desire. 32 Then sounded out throw elphin court, With a loud shout and a cry, That the pretty maid of Chaster's wood That day had caught her prey. 33 ‘O stay, Tomlin,’ cried Elphin Queen, ‘Till I pay you your fee;’ ‘His father has lands and rents enough, He wants no fee from thee.’ 34 ‘O had I known at early morn Tomlin would from me gone, I would have taken out his heart of flesh Put in a heart of stone.’ Young Tamlin TAM LIN—E Motherwell's Note-book, p. 13. 1 Lady Margaret is over gravel green, And over gravel grey, And she's awa to Charteris ha, Lang lang three hour or day. 2 She hadna pu'd a flower, a flower, A flower but only ane, Till up and started young Tamlin, Says, Lady, let alane. 3 She hadna pu'd a flower, a flower, A flower but only twa, Till up and started young Tamlene, Atween her and the wa. 4 ‘How daur you pu my flower, madam?

How dare ye pull this herb,’ he says, ‘To scathe my babe away? 9 ‘This night is Halloweve,’ he said, ‘Our court is going to waste, And them that loves their true-love best At Chester bridge they'll meet. 10 ‘First let pass the black,’ he says, ‘And then let pass the brown, But when ye meet the milk-white steed, Pull ye the rider down. 11 ‘They'll turn me to an eagle,’ he says, ‘And then into an ass; Come, hold me fast, and fear me not, The man that you love best. 12 ‘They'll turn me to a flash of fire, And then to a naked man; Come, wrap you your mantle me about, And then you'll have me won.’ 13 She took her petticoats by the band, Her mantle owre her arm, And she's awa to Chester bridge, As fast as she could run. 14 And first she did let pass the black, And then let pass the brown, But when she met the milk-white steed, She pulled the rider down. 15 They turned him in her arms an eagle, And then into an ass; But she held him fast, and feared him not, The man that she loved best. 16 They turned him into a flash of fire, And then into a naked man; But she wrapped her mantle him about, And then she had him won. 17 ‘O wae be to ye, Lady Margaret, And an ill death may you die, For you've robbed me of the bravest knight That eer rode in our company.’ Tam-a-line, the Elfin Knight; or, Tam a-Lin, or The Knight of Faerylande TAM LIN—G Buchan's MSS, I, 8; Motherwell's MS., p. 595. 1 Take warning, a' ye ladies fair, That wear gowd on your hair, Come never unto Charter's woods, For Tam-a-line he's there. 2 Even about that knight's middle O' siller bells are nine; Nae ane comes to Charter wood, And a maid returns again. 3 Lady Margaret sits in her bower door, Sewing at her silken seam; And she langd to gang to Charter woods, To pou the roses green. 4 She hadna poud a rose, a rose, Nor broken a branch but ane, Till by it came him true Tam-a-line, Says, Ladye, lat alane. 5 O why pou ye the rose, the rose? Or why brake ye the tree? Or why come ye to Charter woods, Without leave askd of me? 6 ‘I will pou the rose, the rose, And I will brake the tree; Charter woods are a' my ain, I'll ask nae leave o thee.’ 7 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, And laid her low on gude green wood, At her he spierd nae leave. 8 When he had got his wills of her, His wills as he had taen, He's taen her by the middle sma, Set her to feet again. 9 She turnd her right and round about, To spier her true-love's name, But naething heard she, nor naething saw, As a' the woods grew dim. 10 Seven days she tarried there, Saw neither sun nor meen; At length, by a sma glimmering light, Came thro the wood her lane. 11 When she came to her father's court, As fine as ony queen; But when eight months were past and gane, Got on the gown o' green. 12 Then out it speaks an eldren knight, As he stood at the yett: ‘Our king's daughter, she gaes wi bairn, And we'll get a' the wyte.’ 13 ‘O had your tongue, ye eldren man, And bring me not to shame; Although that I do gang wi bairn, Yese naeways get the blame. 14 ‘Were my love but an earthly man, As he's an elfin knight, I woudna gie my ain true love For a' that's in my sight.’ 15 Then out it speaks her brither dear, He meant to do her harm: ‘There is an herb in Charter wood Will twine you an the bairn.’ 16 She's taen her mantle her about, Her coffer by the band, And she is on to Charter wood, As fast as she coud gang. 17 She hadna poud a rose, a rose, Nor braken a branch but ane, Till by it came him Tam-a-Line, Says, Ladye, lat alane. 18 O why pou ye the pile, Margaret, The pile o the gravil green, For to destroy the bonny bairn That we got us between? 19 O why pou ye the pile, Margaret, The pile o the gravil gray, For to destroy the bonny bairn That we got in our play? 20 For if it be a knave-bairn, He's heir o a' my land; But if it be a lass-bairn, In red gowd she shall gang. 21 ‘If my luve were an earthly man, As he's an elfin rae, I coud gang bound, love, for your sake, A twalmonth and a day.’ 22 ‘Indeed your love's an earthly man, The same as well as thee, And lang I've haunted Charter woods, A' for your fair bodie.’ 23 ‘O tell me, tell me, Tam-a-Line, O tell, an tell me true, Tell me this night, an mak nae lie, What pedigree are you?’ 24 ‘O I hae been at gude church-door, An I've got christendom; I'm the Earl o' Forbes’ eldest son, An heir ower a' his land. 25 ‘When I was young, o three years old, Muckle was made o me; My step-mother put on my claithes, An ill, ill sained she me. 26 ‘Ae fatal morning I went out, Dreading nae injury, And thinking lang, fell soun asleep, Beneath an apple tree. 27 ‘Then by it came the Elfin Queen, And laid her hand on me; And from that time since ever I mind, I've been in her companie. 28 ‘O Elfin it's a bonny place, In it fain woud I dwell; But ay at ilka seven years' end They pay a tiend to hell, And I'm sae fou o flesh an blude, I'm sair feard for mysell.’ 29 ‘O tell me, tell me, Tam-a-Line, O tell, an tell me true; Tell me this night, an mak nae lie, What way I'll borrow you?’ 30 ‘The morn is Halloweven night, The elfin court will ride, Through England, and thro a' Scotland, And through the world wide. 31 ‘O they begin at sky setting, Rides a' the evening tide; And she that will her true-love borrow, [At] Miles-corse will him bide. 32 ‘Ye'll do you down to Miles-corse, Between twall hours and ane, And full your hands o holy water, And cast your compass roun. 33 ‘Then the first an court that comes you till Is published king and queen; The next an court that comes you till, It is maidens mony ane. 34 ‘The next an court that comes you till Is footmen, grooms and squires; The next an court that comes you till Is knights, and I'll be there. 35 ‘I Tam-a-Line, on milk-white steed, A goud star on my crown;

Ye'll had me fast, lat me not go, And wi you I'll gae hame.’ 44 Then she has done her to Miles-corse, Between twall hours an ane, And filled her hands o holy water, And kiest her compass roun. 45 The first an court that came her till Was published king and queen; The niest an court that came her till Was maidens mony ane. 46 The niest an court that came her till Was footmen, grooms and squires; The niest an court that came her till Was knights, and he was there. 47 True Tam-a-Line, on milk-white steed, A gowd star on his crown; Because he was an earthly man, Got that for a renown. 48 And out at the steed's right nostril, He breathd a fiery flame; She loots her low, an sains hersell, And she was busy then. 49 She's taen the horse then by the head, And loot the bridle fa; The Queen o Elfin she cried out, ‘True Tam-a-Line's awa.’ 50 ‘Stay still, true Tam-a-Line,’ she says, ‘Till I pay you your fee:’ ‘His father wants not lands nor rents, He'll ask nae fee frae thee.’ 51 ‘Gin I had kent yestreen, yestreen, What I ken weel the day, I shoud taen your fu fause heart, Gien you a heart o clay.’ 52 Then he appeared in her arms Like the wolf that neer woud tame;

Or why come ye to Carterhaugh, Withouten leave o me? 9 Says, Carterhaugh it is mine ain, My daddie gave it me; I'll come and gang to Carterhaugh, And ask nae leave o thee. 10 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, Among the leaves sae green, And what they did I cannot tell, The green leaves were between. 11 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, Among the roses red, And what they did I cannot say, She neer returnd a maid. 12 When she cam to her father's ha, She looked pale and wan; They thought she'd dreed some sair sickness, Or been with some leman. 13 She didna comb her yellow hair Nor make meikle o her head, And ilka thing that lady took Was like to be her deid. 14 It's four and twenty ladies fair Were playing at the ba; Janet, the wightest of them anes, Was faintest o them a'. 15 Four and twenty ladies fair Were playing at the chess; And out there came the fair Janet, As green as any grass. 16 Out and spak an auld grey-headed knight, Lay oer the castle wa: ‘And ever, alas! for thee, Janet, But we'll be blamed a'!’ 17 ‘Now haud your tongue, ye auld grey knight, And an ill deid may ye die! Father my bairn on whom I will, I'll father nane on thee.’ 18 Out then spak her father dear, And he spak meik and mild: ‘And ever, alas! my sweet Janet, I fear ye gae with child.’ 19 ‘And if I be with child, father, Mysell maun bear the blame; There's neer a knight about your ha Shall hae the bairnie's name. 20 ‘And if I be with child, father, 'Twill prove a wondrous birth, For weel I swear I'm not wi bairn To any man on earth. 21 ‘If my love were an earthly knight, As he's an elfin grey, I wadna gie my ain true love For nae lord that ye hae.’ 22 She prinkd hersell and prinnd hersell, By the ae light of the moon, And she's away to Carterhaugh, To speak wi young Tamlane. 23 And when she cam to Carterhaugh, She gaed beside the well, And there she saw the steed standing, But away was himsell. 24 She hadna pu'd a double rose, A rose but only twae, When up and started young Tamlane, Says, Lady, thou pu's nae mae. 25 Why pu ye the rose, Janet, Within this garden grene, And a' to kill the bonny babe That we got us between? 26 ‘The truth ye'll tell to me, Tamlane, A word ye mauna lie; Gin eer ye was in haly chapel, Or sained in Christentie?’ 27 ‘The truth I'll tell to thee, Janet, A word I winna lie; A knight me got, and a lady me bore, As well as they did thee. 28 ‘Randolph, Earl Murray, was my sire, Dunbar, Earl March, is thine; We loved when we were children small, Which yet you well may mind. 29 ‘When I was a boy just turnd of nine, My uncle sent for me, To hunt and hawk, and ride with him, And keep him companie. 30 ‘There came a wind out of the north, A sharp wind and a snell, And a deep sleep came over me, And frae my horse I fell. 31 ‘The Queen of Fairies keppit me In yon green hill to dwell, And I'm a fairy, lyth and limb, Fair ladye, view me well. 32 ‘Then would I never tire, Janet, In Elfish land to dwell, But aye, at every seven years, They pay the teind to hell; And I am sae fat and fair of flesh, I fear't will be mysell. 33 ‘This night is Halloween, Janet, The morn is Hallowday, And gin ye dare your true love win, Ye hae nae time to stay. 34 ‘The night it is good Halloween, When fairy folk will ride, And they that wad their true-love win, At Miles Cross they maun bide.’ 35 ‘But how shall I thee ken, Tamlane? Or how shall I thee knaw, Amang so many unearthly knights, The like I never saw?’ 36 ‘The first company that passes by, Say na, and let them gae; The next company that passes by, Say na, and do right sae; The third company that passes by, Then I'll be ane o thae. 37 ‘First let pass the black, Janet, And syne let pass the brown, But grip ye to the milk-white steed, And pu the rider down. 38 ‘For I ride on the milk-white steed, And aye nearest the town; Because I was a christend knight, They gave me that renown. 39 ‘My right hand will be gloved, Janet, My left hand will be bare; And these the tokens I gie thee, Nae doubt I will be there. 40 ‘They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, An adder and a snake; But had me fast, let me not pass, Gin ye wad be my maik. 41 ‘They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, An adder and an ask; They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, A bale that burns fast. 42 ‘They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, A red-hot gad o airn; But haud me fast, let me not pass, For I'll do you no harm. 43 ‘First dip me in a stand o milk, And then in a stand o water; But had me fast, let me not pass, I'll be your bairn's father. 44 ‘And next they'll shape me in your arms A tod but and an eel; But had me fast, nor let me gang, As you do love me weel. 45 ‘They'll shape me in your arms, Janet, A dove but and a swan, And last they'll shape me in your arms A mother-naked man; Cast your green mantle over me, I'll be myself again.’ 46 Gloomy, gloomy, was the night, And eiry was the way, As fair Janet, in her green mantle, To Miles Cross she did gae. 47 About the dead hour o the night She heard the bridles ring, And Janet was as glad o that As any earthly thing. 48 And first gaed by the black black steed, And then gaed by the brown; But fast she gript the milk-white steed, And pu'd the rider down. 49 She pu'd him frae the milk-white steed, And loot the bridle fa, And up there raise an erlish cry, ‘He's won amang us a'!’ 50 They shaped him in fair Janet's arms An esk but and an adder; She held him fast in every shape, To be her bairn's father. 51 They shaped him in her arms at last A mother-naked man, She wrapt him in her green mantle, And sae her true love wan. 52 Up then spake the Queen o Fairies, Out o a bush o broom: ‘She that has borrowd young Tamlane Has gotten a stately groom.’ 53 Up then spake the Queen o Fairies, Out o a bush o rye: ‘She's taen awa the bonniest knight In a' my cumpanie. 54 ‘But had I kennd, Tamlane,’ she says, ‘A lady wad borrowd thee I wad taen out thy twa grey een, Put in twa een o tree. 55 ‘Had I but kennd, Tamlane,’ she says, ‘Before ye came frae hame, I wad taen out your heart o flesh, Put in a heart o stane. 56 ‘Had I but had the wit yestreen That I hae coft the day, I'd paid my kane seven times to hell Ere you'd been won away.’ Young Tamlane TAM LIN—J Kinloch MSS, V, 391.

Breaks branches off the tree? Or who's this treads my garden-grass, Without the leave of me? 4 ‘Yes, I will pull the red, red rose, Break branches off the tree, This garden in Moorcartney wood, Without the leave o thee.’ 5 He took her by the milk-white hand And gently laid her down, Just in below some shady trees Where the green leaves hung down. 6 ‘Come tell to me, kind sir,’ she said, ‘What before you never told; Are you an earthly man?’ said she, ‘A knight or a baron bold?’ 7 ‘I'll tell to you, fair lady,’ he said, ‘What before I neer did tell; I'm Earl Douglas's second son, With the queen of the fairies I dwell. 8 ‘When riding through yon forest-wood, And by yon grass-green well, A sudden sleep me overtook, And off my steed I fell. 9 ‘The queen of the fairies, being there, Made me with her to dwell, And still once in the seven years We pay a teind to hell. 10 ‘And because I am an earthly man, Myself doth greatly fear, For the cleverest man in all our train To Pluto must go this year. 11 ‘This night is Halloween, lady, And the fairies they will ride; The maid that will her true-love win At Miles Cross she may bide.’ 12 ‘But how shall I thee ken, though, sir? Or how shall I thee know, Amang a pack o hellish wraiths, Before I never saw?’ 13 ‘Some rides upon a black horse, lady, And some upon a brown, But I myself on a milk-white steed, And I aye nearest the toun. 14 ‘My right hand shall be covered, lady, My left hand shall be bare, And that's a token good enough That you will find me there. 15 ‘Take the Bible in your right hand, With God for to be your guide, Take holy water in thy left hand, And throw it on every side.’ 16 She's taen her mantle her about, A cane into her hand, And she has unto Miles Cross gone, As hard as she can gang. 17 First she has letten the black pass by, And then she has letten the brown, But she's taen a fast hold o the milk-white steed, And she's pulled Earl Thomas doun. 18 The queen of the fairies being there, Sae loud she's letten a cry, ‘The maid that sits in Katherine's Hall This night has gotten her prey. 19 ‘But hadst thou waited, fair lady, Till about this time the morn, He would hae been as far from thee or me As the wind that blew when he was born.’ 20 They turned him in this lady's arms Like the adder and the snake; She held him fast; why should she not? Though her poor heart was like to break. 21 They turned him in this lady's arms Like two red gads of airn; She held him fast; why should she not? She knew they could do her no harm. 22 They turned him in this lady's arms Like to all things that was vile; She held him fast; why should she not?

If I like the humour you shan't be deny'd; I love to be merry and free.’ 3 Quoth he, ‘I will lay you an hundred pounds, A hundred pounds, aye, and ten, That a maid if you go to the merry broomfield, That a maid you return not again.’ 4 ‘I'll lay you that wager,’ the lady she said, Then the money she flung down amain; ‘To the merry broomfield I'll go a pure maid, The same I'll return home again.’ 5 He coverd her bett in the midst of the hall With an hundred and ten jolly pounds, And then to his servant straightway he did call, For to bring forth his hawk and his hounds. 6 A ready obedience the servant did yield, And all was made ready oer night; Next morning he went to the merry broomfield, To meet with his love and delight. 7 Now when he came there, having waited a while, Among the green broom down he lies; The lady came to him, and coud not but smile, For sleep then had closed his eyes. 8 Upon his right hand a gold ring she secur'd, Down from her own finger so fair, That when he awaked he might be assur'd His lady and love had been there. 9 She left him a posie of pleasant perfume, Then stept from the place where he lay; Then hid herself close in the besom of the broom, To hear what her true-love would say. 10 He wakend and found the gold ring on his hand, Then sorrow of heart he was in: ‘My love has been here, I do well understand, And this wager I now shall not win. 11 ‘O where was you, my goodly gawshawk, The which I have purchasd so dear? Why did you not waken me out of my sleep When the lady, my lover, was here?’ 12 ‘O with my bells did I ring, master, And eke with my feet did I run; And still did I cry, Pray awake, master, She's here now, and soon will be gone.’ 13 ‘O where was you, my gallant greyhound, Whose collar is flourishd with gold? Why hadst thou not wakend me out of my sleep When thou didst my lady behold?’ 14 ‘Dear master, I barkd with my mouth when she came, And likewise my coller I shook, And told you that here was the beautiful dame, But no notice of me then you took.’ 15 ‘O where was thou, my serving-man, Whom I have cloathed so fine? If you had wak'd me when she was here, The wager then had been mine.’ 16 ‘In the night ye should have slept, master, And kept awake in the day; Had you not been sleeping when hither she came, Then a maid she had not gone away.’ 17 Then home he returnd, when the wager was lost, With sorrow of heart, I may say; The lady she laughd to find her love crost, — This was upon midsummer-day. 18 ‘O squire, I laid in the bushes conceald, And heard you when you did complain; And thus I have been to the merry broomfield, And a maid returnd back again. 19 ‘Be chearful, be chearful, and do not repine, For now't is as clear as the sun, The money, the money, the money is mine, The wager I fairly have won.’ 44 THE TWA MAGICIANS THE TWA MAGICIANS Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 24; Motherwell's MS., p. 570. 1 The lady stands in her bower door, As straight as willow wand; The blacksmith stood a little forebye, Wi hammer in his hand. 2 ‘Weel may ye dress ye, lady fair, Into your robes o red; Before the morn at this same time, I'll gain your maidenhead.’ 3 ‘Awa, awa, ye coal-black smith, Woud ye do me the wrang To think to gain my maidenhead, That I hae kept sae lang!’ 4 Then she has hadden up her hand, And she sware by the mold, ‘I wudna be a blacksmith's wife For the full o a chest o gold. 5 ‘I'd rather I were dead and gone, And my body laid in grave, Ere a rusty stock o coal-black smith My maidenhead shoud have.’ 6 But he has hadden up his hand, And he sware by the mass, ‘I'll cause ye be my light leman For the hauf o that and less.’ O bide, lady, bide, And aye he bade her bide; The rusty smith your leman shall be, For a' your muckle pride. 7 Then she became a turtle dow, To fly up in the air, And he became another dow, And they flew pair and pair. O bide, lady, bide, &amp;c. 8 She turnd hersell into an eel, To swim into yon burn, And he became a speckled trout, To gie the eel a turn. O bide, lady, bide, &amp;c. 9 Then she became a duck, a duck, To puddle in a peel, And he became a rose-kaimd drake, To gie the duck a dreel. O bide, lady, bide, &amp;c. 10 She turnd hersell into a hare, To rin upon yon hill, And he became a gude grey-hound, And boldly he did fill. O bide, lady, bide, &amp;c. 11 Then she became a gay grey mare, And stood in yonder slack, And he became a gilt saddle, And sat upon her back. Was she wae, he held her sae, And still he bade her bide; The rusty smith her leman was, For a' her muckle pride. 12 Then she became a het girdle, And he became a cake, And a' the ways she turnd hersell, The blacksmith was her make. Was she wae, &amp;c. 13 She turnd hersell into a ship, To sail out ower the flood; He ca'ed a nail intill her tail, And syne the ship she stood. Was she wae, &amp;c. 14 Then she became a silken plaid, And stretchd upon a bed, And he became a green covering, And gaind her maidenhead. Was she wae, &amp;c. 45 KING JOHN AND THE BISHOP Kinge John and Bishoppe KING JOHN AND THE BISHOP—A Percy MS., p. 184. Hales and Furnivall, I, 508. 1 Off an ancient story Ile tell you anon, Of a notable prince that was called King Iohn, In England was borne, with maine and with might; Hee did much wrong and mainteined litle right. 2 This noble prince was vexed in veretye, For he was angry with the Bishopp of Canterbury; Ffor his house-keeping and his good cheere, Thé rode post for him, as you shall heare. 3 They rode post for him verry hastilye; The king sayd the bishopp kept a better house then hee: A hundred men euen, as I [have heard] say, The bishopp kept in his house euerye day, And fifty gold chaines, without any doubt, In veluett coates waited the bishopp about. 4 The bishopp, he came to the court anon, Before his prince that was called King Iohn. As soone as the bishopp the king did see, ‘O,’ quoth the king, ‘bishopp, thow art welcome to mee. There is noe man soe welcome to towne As thou that workes treason against my crowne.’ 5 ‘My leege,’ quoth the bishopp, ‘I wold it were knowne I spend, your grace, nothing but that that's my owne; I trust your grace will doe me noe deare For spending my owne trew gotten geere.’ 6 ‘Yes,’ quoth the king, ‘bishopp, thou must needs dye, Eccept thou can answere mee questions three; Thy head shalbe smitten quite from thy bodye, And all thy liuing remayne vnto mee. 7 ‘First,’ quoth the king, ‘tell me in this steade, With this crowne of gold heere vpon my head, Amongst my nobilitye, with ioy and much mirth, Lett me know within one pennye what I am worth. 8 ‘Secondlye, tell me without any dowbt How soone I may goe the whole world about; And thirdly, tell mee or euer I stinte, What is the thing, bishopp, that I doe thinke. Twenty dayes pardon thoust haue trulye, And come againe and answere mee.’ 9 The bishopp bade the king god night att a word; He rode betwixt Cambridge and Oxenford, But neuer a doctor there was soe wise Cold shew him these questions or enterprise. 10 Wherewith the bishopp was nothing gladd, But in his hart was heauy and sadd, And hyed him home to a house in the countrye, To ease some part of his melanchollye. 11 His halfe-brother dwelt there, was feirce and fell, Noe better but a shepard to the bishoppe himsell; The shepard came to the bishopp anon, Saying, My Lord, you are welcome home! 12 ‘What ayles you,’ quoth the shepard, ‘that you are soe sadd, And had wonte to haue beene soe merry and gladd?’ ‘Nothing,’ quoth the bishopp, ‘I ayle att this time; Will not thee availe to know, brother mine.’ 13 ‘Brother,’ quoth the shepeard, ‘you haue heard itt, That a ffoole may teach a wisemane witt; Say me therfore whatsoeuer you will, And if I doe you noe good, Ile doe you noe ill.’ 14 Quoth the bishop: I haue beene att the court anon, Before my prince is called King Iohn, And there he hath charged mee Against his crowne with traitorye. 15 If I cannott answer his misterye, Three questions hee hath propounded to mee, He will haue my land soe faire and free, And alsoe the head from my bodye. 16 The first question was, to tell him in that stead, With the crowne of gold vpon his head, Amongst his nobilitye, with ioy and much mirth, To lett him know within one penye what hee is worth. 17 And secondlye, to tell him with-out any doubt How soone he may goe the whole world about; And thirdlye, to tell him, or ere I stint, What is the thinge that he does thinke. 18 ‘Brother,’ quoth the shepard, ‘you are a man of learninge; What neede you stand in doubt of soe small a thinge? Lend me,’ quoth the shepard, ‘your ministers apparrell, Ile ryde to the court and answere your quarrell. 19 ‘Lend me your serving men, say me not nay, With all your best horsses that ryd on the way; Ile to the court, this matter to stay; Ile speake with King Iohn and heare what heele say.’ 20 The bishopp with speed prepared then To sett forth the shepard with horsse and man; The shepard was liuely without any doubt; I wott a royall companye came to the court. 21 The shepard hee came to the court anon Before [his] prince that was called King Iohn. As soone as the king the shepard did see, ‘O,’ quoth the king, ‘bishopp, thou art welcome to me.’ The shepard was soe like the bishopp his brother, The king cold not know the one from the other. 22 Quoth the king, Bishopp, thou art welcome to me If thou can answer me my questions three. Said the shepeard, If it please your grace, Show mee what the first quest[i]on was. 23 ‘First,’ quoth the king, ‘tell mee in this stead, With the crowne of gold vpon my head, Amongst my nobilitye, with ioy and much mirth, Within one pennye what I am worth.’ 24 Quoth the shepard, To make your grace noe offence, I thinke you are worth nine and twenty pence; For our Lord Iesus, that bought vs all, For thirty pence was sold into thrall Amongst the cursed Iewes, as I to you doe showe; But I know Christ was one penye better then you. 25 Then the king laught, and swore by St Andrew He was not thought to bee of such a small value. ‘Secondlye, tell mee with-out any doubt How soone I may goe the world round about.’ 26 Saies the shepard, It is noe time with your grace to scorne, But rise betime with the sun in the morne, And follow his course till his vprising, And then you may know without any leasing. 27 And this [to] your grace shall proue the same, You are come to the same place from whence you came; [In] twenty-four houres, with-out any doubt, Your grace may the world goe round about; The world round about, euen as I doe say, If with the sun you can goe the next way. 28 ‘And thirdlye tell me or euer I stint, What is the thing, bishoppe, that I doe thinke.’ ‘That shall I doe,’ quoth the shepeard; ‘for veretye, You thinke I am the bishopp of Canterburye.’ 29 ‘Why, art not thou? the truth tell to me; For I doe thinke soe,’ quoth the king, ‘by St Marye.’ ‘Not soe,’ quoth the shepeard; ‘the truth shalbe knowne, I am his poore shepeard; my brother is att home.’ 30 ‘Why,’ quoth the king, ‘if itt soe bee, Ile make thee bishopp here to mee.’ ‘Noe, Sir,’ quoth the shepard, ‘I pray you be still, For Ile not bee bishop but against my will; For I am not fitt for any such deede, For I can neither write nor reede.’ 31 ‘Why then,’ quoth the king, ‘Ile giue thee cleere A pattent of three hundred pound a yeere; That I will giue thee franke and free; Take thee that, shepard, for coming to me. 32 ‘Free pardon Ile giue,’ the kings grace said, ‘To saue the bishopp, his land and his head; With him nor thee Ile be nothing wrath; Here is the pardon for him and thee both.’ 33 Then the shepard he had noe more to say, But tooke the pardon and rode his way: When he came to the bishopps place, The bishopp asket anon how all things was. 34 ‘Brother,’ quoth the shepard, ‘I haue well sped, For I haue saued both your land and your head; The king with you is nothing wrath, For heere is the pardon for you and mee both.’ 35 Then the bishopes hart was of a merry cheere: ‘Brother, thy paines Ile quitt them cleare; For I will giue thee a patent to thee and to thine Of fifty pound a yeere, land good and fine.’ 36 ‘I will to thee noe longer croche nor creepe, Nor Ile serue thee noe more to keepe thy sheepe.’ 37 Whereeuer wist you shepard before, That had in his head witt such store To pleasure a bishopp in such a like case, To answer three questions to the kings grace? Whereeuer wist you shepard gett cleare Three hundred and fifty pound a yeere? 38 I neuer hard of his fellow before. Nor I neuer shall: now I need to say noe more. I neuer knew shepeard that gott such a liuinge But David, the shepeard, that was a king. King John and the Abbot of Canterbury KING JOHN AND THE BISHOP—B Broadside, printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden Ball in Pye-corner (1672-95). 1 I'll tell you a story, a story anon, Of a noble prince, and his name was King John; For he was a prince, and a prince of great might, He held up great wrongs, he put down great right. Derry down, down hey, derry down 2 I'll tell you a story, a story so merry, Concerning the Abbot of Canterbury, And of his house-keeping and high renown, Which made him resort to fair London town. 3 ‘How now, father abbot? 'Tis told unto me That thou keepest a far better house than I; And for [thy] house-keeping and high renown, I fear thou has treason against my crown.’ 4 ‘I hope, my liege, that you owe me no grudge For spending of my true-gotten goods:’ ‘If thou dost not answer me questions three, Thy head shall be taken from thy body. 5 ‘When I am set so high on my steed, With my crown of gold upon my head, Amongst all my nobility, with joy and much mirth, Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worth. 6 ‘And the next question you must not flout, How long I shall be riding the world about; And the third question thou must not shrink, But tell to me truly what I do think.’ 7 ‘O these are hard questions for my shallow wit, For I cannot answer your grace as yet; But if you will give me but three days space, I'll do my endeavor to answer your grace.’ 8 ‘O three days space I will thee give, For that is the longest day thou hast to live. And if thou dost not answer these questions right, Thy head shall be taken from thy body quite.’ 9 And as the shepherd was going to his fold, He spy'd the old abbot come riding along: ‘How now, master abbot? You'r welcome home; What news have you brought from good King John?’ 10 ‘Sad news, sad news I have thee to give, For I have but three days space for to live; If I do not answer him questions three, My head will be taken from my body. 11 ‘When he is set so high on his steed, With his crown of gold upon his head, Amongst all his nobility, with joy and much mirth, I must tell him to one penny what he is worth. 12 ‘And the next question I must not flout, How long he shall be riding the world about; And the third question I must not shrink, But tell him truly what he does think.’ 13 ‘O master, did you never hear it yet, That a fool may learn a wiseman wit? Lend me but your horse and your apparel, I'll ride to fair London and answer the quarrel.’ 14 ‘Now I am set so high on my steed, With my crown of gold upon my head, Amongst all my nobility, with joy and much mirth, Now tell me to one penny what I am worth.’ 15 ‘For thirty pence our Saviour was sold, Amongst the false Jews, as you have been told, And nine and twenty's the worth of thee, For I think thou are one penny worser than he.’ 16 ‘And the next question thou mayst not flout; How long I shall be riding the world about.’ ‘You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same, Until the next morning he rises again, And then I am sure you will make no doubt But in twenty-four hours you'l ride it about.’ 17 ‘And the third question you must not shrink, But tell me truly what I do think.’ ‘All that I can do, and 't will make you merry; For you think I'm the Abbot of Canterbury, But I'm his poor shepherd, as you may see, And am come to beg pardon for he and for me.’ 18 The king he turned him about and did smile, Saying, Thou shalt be the abbot the other while: ‘O no, my grace, there is no such need, For I can neither write nor read.’ 19 ‘Then four pounds a week will I give unto thee For this merry jest thou hast told unto me; And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home, Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.’ 46 CAPTAIN WEDDERBURN'S COURTSHIP I'll no ly neist the wa; or, She'll no ly neist [the] wa CAPTAIN WEDDERBURN'S COURTSHIP—A a. Herd's MS., I, 161. b. The same, II, 100. 1 The laird of Bristoll's daughter was in the woods walking, And by came Captain Wetherbourn, a servant to the king; And he said to his livery man, Wer't not against the law, I would tak her to mine ain bed, and lay her neist the wa. 2 ‘I'm into my father's woods, amongst my father's trees, O kind sir, let mee walk alane, O kind sir, if you please; The butler's bell it will be rung, and I'll be mist awa; I'll lye into mine ain bed, neither at stock nor wa.’ 3 ‘O my bonny lady, the bed it's not be mine, For I'll command my servants for to call it thine; The hangings are silk satin, the sheets are holland sma, And we's baith lye in ae bed, but you's lye neist the wa. 4 ‘And so, my bonny lady, — I do not know your name, — But my name's Captain Wetherburn, and I'm a man of fame; Tho your father and a' his men were here, I would na stand in awe To tak you to mine ain bed, and lay you neist the wa. 5 ‘Oh my bonny, bonny lady, if you'll gie me your hand, You shall hae drums and trumpets to sound at your command; Wi fifty men to guard you, sae weel their swords can dra, And wee's baith lye in ae bed, but you's lye neist the wa.’ 6 He's mounted her upon a steid, behind his gentleman, And he himself did walk afoot, to had his lady on, With his hand about her midle sae jimp, for fear that she should fa; She man lye in his bed, but she'll not lye neist the wa. 7 He's taen her into Edinburgh, his landlady cam ben: ‘And monny bonny ladys in Edinburgh hae I seen, But the like of this fine creature my eyes they never sa;’ ‘O dame bring ben a down-bed, for she's lye neist the wa.’ 8 ‘Hold your tongue, young man,’ she said, ‘and dinna trouble me, Unless you get to my supper, and that is dishes three; Dishes three to my supper, tho I eat nane at a’, Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa. 9 ‘You maun get to my supper a cherry but a stane, And you man get to my supper a capon but a bane, And you man get a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga, Before I lye in your bed, but I'll not lye neist the wa.’ 10 ‘A cherry whan in blossom is a cherry but a stane; A capon when he's in the egg canna hae a bane; The dow it is a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga; And ye man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.’ 11 ‘Hold your tongue, young man,’ she said, ‘and dinna me perplex, Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions six; Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa, Before I lye in your bed, but I'll not lye neist the wa. 12 ‘What is greener than the grass, what's higher than the tree? What's war than a woman's wiss, what's deeper than the sea? What bird sings first, and whereupon the dew down first does fa? Before I lye in your bed, but I'll not lye neist the wa.’ 13 ‘Virgus is greener than the grass, heaven's higher than the tree; The deil's war than a woman's wish, hell's deeper than the sea; The cock sings first, on the Sugar Loaf the dew down first does fa; And ye man lye in my bed, betweest me and the wa.’ 14 ‘Hold your tongue, young man,’ she said, ‘I pray you give it oer, Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions four; Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa, Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa. 15 ‘You man get to me a plumb that does in winter grow; And likewise a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro; A sparrow's horn, a priest unborn, this night to join us twa, Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.’ 16 ‘There is a plumb in my father's yeard that does in winter grow; Likewise he has a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro; A sparrow's horn, it may be found, there's ane in every tae, There's ane upo the mouth of him, perhaps there may be twa. 17 ‘The priest is standing at the door, just ready to come in; Nae man could sae that he was born, to lie it is a sin; For a wild boar bored his mother's side, he out of it did fa; And you man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.’ 18 Little kent Grizey Sinclair, that morning when she raise, 'Twas to be the hindermost of a' her single days; For now she's Captain Wetherburn's wife, a man she never saw, And she man lye in his bed, but she'll not lye neist the wa.

He said unto his livery-man, Were't na agen the law, I wad tak her to my ain bed, and lay her at the wa. 2 ‘I'm walking here my lane,’ she says, ‘amang my father's trees; And ye may lat me walk my lane, kind sir, now gin ye please. The supper-bell it will be rung, and I'll be missd awa; Sae I'll na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.’ 3 He said, My pretty lady, I pray lend me your hand, And ye'll hae drums and trumpets always at your command; And fifty men to guard ye wi, that weel their swords can draw; Sae we'll baith lie in ae bed, and ye'll lie at the wa. 4 ‘Haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray let go my hand; The supper-bell it will be rung, nae langer maun I stand. My father he'll na supper tak, gif I be missd awa; Sae I'll na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.’ 5 ‘O my name is Captain Wedderburn, my name I'll neer deny, And I command ten thousand men, upo yon mountains high. Tho your father and his men were here, of them I'd stand na awe, But should tak ye to my ain bed, and lay ye neist the wa.’ 6 Then he lap aff his milk-white steed, and set the lady on, And a' the way he walkd on foot, he held her by the hand; He held her by the middle jimp, for fear that she should fa; Saying, I'll tak ye to my ain bed, and lay thee at the wa. 7 He took her to his quartering-house, his landlady looked ben, Saying, Monie a pretty ladie in Edinbruch I've seen; But sic 'na pretty ladie is not into it a': Gae, mak for her a fine down-bed, and lay her at the wa. 8 ‘O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye lat me be, For I'll na lie in your bed till I get dishes three; Dishes three maun be dressd for me, gif I should eat them a', Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa. 9 ‘'Tis I maun hae to my supper a chicken without a bane; And I maun hae to my supper a cherry without a stane; And I maun hae to my supper a bird without a gaw, Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.’ 10 ‘Whan the chicken's in the shell, I am sure it has na bane; And whan the cherry's in the bloom, I wat it has na stane; The dove she is a genty bird, she flees without a gaw; Sae we'll baith lie in ae bed, and ye'll be at the wa.’ 11 ‘O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye give me owre, For I'll na lie in your bed, till I get presents four; Presents four ye maun gie me, and that is twa and twa, Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa. 12 ‘'Tis I maun hae some winter fruit that in December grew; And I maun hae a silk mantil that waft gaed never through; A sparrow's horn, a priest unborn, this nicht to join us twa, Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.’ 13 ‘My father has some winter fruit that in December grew; My mither has a silk mantil the waft gaed never through; A sparrow's horn ye soon may find, there's ane on evry claw, And twa upo the gab o it, and ye shall get them a'. 14 ‘The priest he stands without the yett, just ready to come in; Nae man can say he eer was born, nae man without he sin; He was haill cut frae his mither's side, and frae the same let fa; Sae we'll baith lie in ae bed, and ye'se lie at the wa.’ 15 ‘O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray don't me perplex, For I'll na lie in your bed till ye answer questions six: Questions six ye maun answer me, and that is four and twa, Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa. 16 ‘O what is greener than the gress, what's higher than thae trees? O what is worse than women's wish, what's deeper than the seas? What bird craws first, what tree buds first, what first does on them fa? Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.’ 17 ‘Death is greener than the gress, heaven higher than thae trees; The devil's waur than women's wish, hell's deeper than the seas; The cock craws first, the cedar buds first, dew first on them does fa; Sae we'll baith lie in ae bed, and ye'se lie at the wa.’ 18 Little did this lady think, that morning whan she raise, That this was for to be the last o a' her maiden days.

And if you do not grant me love, This night for thee I'll die.’ 5 ‘If you should die for me, sir knight, There's few for you will meane; For mony a better has died for me, Whose graves are growing green. 6 [‘But ye maun read my riddle,’ she said, ‘And answer my questions three; And but ye read them right,’ she said, ‘Gae stretch ye out and die.] 7 ‘Now what is the flower, the ae first flower, Springs either on moor or dale?

Hales and Furnivall, II, 328. 1 As I was cast in my ffirst sleepe, A dreadffull draught in my mind I drew, Ffor I was dreamed of a yong man, Some men called him yonge Andrew. 2 The moone shone bright, and itt cast a ffayre light, Sayes shee, Welcome, my honey, my hart, and my sweete! For I haue loued thee this seuen long yeere, And our chance itt was wee cold neuer meete. 3 Then he tooke her in his armes two, And kissed her both cheeke and chin, And twise or thrise he pleased this may Before they tow did part in twinn. 4 Saies, Now, good sir, you haue had your will, You can demand no more of mee; Good sir, remember what you said before, And goe to the church and marry mee. 5 ‘Ffaire maid, I cannott doe as I wold; Goe home and fett thy fathers redd gold, And I'le goe to the church and marry thee. 6 This ladye is gone to her ffathers hall, And well she knew where his red gold lay, And counted fforth five hundred pound, Besides all other iuells and chaines: 7 And brought itt all to younge Andrew, Itt was well counted vpon his knee; Then he tooke her by the lillye white hand, And led her vp to an hill soe hye. 8 Shee had vpon a gowne of blacke veluett, (A pittyffull sight after yee shall see:) ‘Put of thy clothes, bonny wenche,’ he sayes, ‘For noe ffoote further thoust gang with mee.’ 9 But then shee put of her gowne of veluett, With many a salt teare from her eye, And in a kirtle of ffine breaden silke Shee stood beffore young Andrews eye. 10 Sais, O put off thy kirtle of silke, Ffor some and all shall goe with mee; And to my owne lady I must itt beare, Who I must needs loue better then thee. 11 Then shee put of her kirtle of silke, With many a salt teare still ffrom her eye; In a peticoate of scarlett redd Shee stood before young Andrewes eye. 12 Saies, O put of thy peticoate, For some and all of itt shall goe with mee; And to my owne lady I will itt beare, Which dwells soe ffarr in a strange countrye 13 But then shee put of her peticoate, With many a salt teare still from her eye, And in a smocke of braue white silke Shee stood before young Andrews eye. 14 Saies, O put of thy smocke of silke, For some and all shall goe with mee; Vnto my owne ladye I will itt beare, That dwells soe ffarr in a strange countrye. 15 Sayes, O remember, young Andrew, Once of a woman you were borne; And ffor that birth that Marye bore, I pray you let my smocke be vpon! 16 ‘Yes, ffayre ladye, I know itt well, Once of a woman I was borne; Yett ffor noe birth that Mary bore, Thy smocke shall not be left here vpon.’ 17 But then shee put of her head-geere ffine; Shee hadd billaments worth a hundred pound; The hayre that was vpon this bony wench head Couered her bodye downe to the ground. 18 Then he pulled forth a Scottish brand, And held itt there in his owne right hand; Saies, Whether wilt thou dye vpon my swords point, ladye, Or thow wilt goe naked home againe? 19 ‘Liffe is sweet,’ then, ‘sir,’ said shee, ‘Therfore I pray you leaue mee with mine; Before I wold dye on your swords point, I had rather goe naked home againe. 20 ‘My ffather,’ shee sayes, ‘is a right good erle As any remaines in his countrye; If euer he doe your body take, You'r sure to fflower a gallow tree. 21 ‘And I haue seuen brethren,’ shee sayes, ‘And they are all hardy men and bold; Giff euer thé doe your body take, You must neuer gang quicke ouer the mold.’ 22 ‘If your ffather be a right good erle As any remaines in his owne countrye, Tush! he shall neuer my body take, I'le gang soe ffast ouer the sea. 23 ‘If you haue seuen brethren,’ he sayes, ‘If they be neuer soe hardy or bold, Tush! they shall neuer my body take, I'le gang soe ffast into the Scottish mold.’ 24 Now this ladye is gone to her fathers hall, When euery body their rest did take; But the Erle which was her ffather Lay waken for his deere daughters sake. 25 ‘But who is that,’ her ffather can say, ‘That soe priuilye knowes the pinn?’ ‘It's Hellen, your owne deere daughter, ffather, I pray you rise and lett me in.’ 26 ‘Noe, by my hood!’ quoth her ffather then, ‘My [house] thoust neuer come within, Without I had my red gold againe.’ 27 ‘Nay, your gold is gone, ffather!’ said shee, ‘Then naked thou came into this world, And naked thou shalt returne againe.’ 28 ‘Nay! God fforgaue his death, father,’ shee sayes, ‘And soe I hope you will doe mee;’ ‘Away, away, thou cursed woman, I pray God an ill death thou may dye!’ 29 Shee stood soe long quacking on the ground Till her hart itt burst in three; And then shee ffell dead downe in a swoond, And this was the end of this bonny ladye. 30 Ithe morning, when her ffather gott vpp, A pittyffull sight there he might see; His owne deere daughter was dead, without clothes, The teares they trickeled fast ffrom his eye. 31 Sais, Fye of gold, and ffye of ffee! For I sett soe much by my red gold That now itt hath lost both my daughter and mee!’ 32 But after this time he neere dought good day, But as flowers doth fade in the frost, Soe he did wast and weare away. 33 But let vs leaue talking of this ladye, And talke some more of young Andrew; Ffor ffalse he was to this bonny ladye, More pitty that he had not beene true. 34 He was not gone a mile into the wild forrest, Or halfe a mile into the hart of Wales, But there they cought him by such a braue wyle That hee must come to tell noe more tales. 35 Ffull soone a wolfe did of him smell, And shee came roaring like a beare, And gaping like a ffeend of hell. 36 Soe they ffought together like two lyons, And fire betweene them two glashet out; Thé raught eche other such a great rappe, That there young Andrew was slaine, well I wott. 37 But now young Andrew he is dead, But he was neuer buryed vnder mold, For ther as the wolfe devoured him, There lyes all this great erles gold. 49 THE TWA BROTHERS THE TWA BROTHERS—A Sharpe's Ballad Book, p. 56, No 19. 1 There were twa brethren in the north, They went to the school thegither; The one unto the other said, Will you try a warsle afore? 2 They warsled up, they warsled down, Till Sir John fell to the ground, And there was a knife in Sir Willie's pouch, Gied him a deadlie wound. 3 ‘Oh brither dear, take me on your back, Carry me to yon burn clear, And wash the blood from off my wound, And it will bleed nae mair.’ 4 He took him up upon his back, Carried him to yon burn clear, And washd the blood from off his wound, But aye it bled the mair. 5 ‘Oh brither dear, take me on your back, Carry me to yon kirk-yard, And dig a grave baith wide and deep, And lay my body there.’ 6 He's taen him up upon his back, Carried him to yon kirk-yard, And dug a grave baith deep and wide, And laid his body there. 7 ‘But what will I say to my father dear, Gin he chance to say, Willie, whar's John?’ ‘Oh say that he's to England gone, To buy him a cask of wine.’ 8 ‘And what will I say to my mother dear, Gin she chance to say, Willie, whar's John?’ ‘Oh say that he's to England gone, To buy her a new silk gown.’ 9 ‘And what will I say to my sister dear, Gin she chance to say, Willie, whar's John?’ ‘Oh say that he's to England gone, To buy her a wedding ring.’ 10 ‘But what will I say to her you loe dear, Gin she cry, Why tarries my John?’ ‘Oh tell her I lie in Kirk-land fair, And home again will never come.’ The Cruel Brother THE TWA BROTHERS—B Motherwell's MS., p. 259.

Or will ye gae to the wood a-warslin, To see whilk o's maun fa?’ 2 ‘It's I winna gae to the school, brother, Nor will I gae to the ba; But I will gae to the wood a-warslin, And it is you maun fa.’ 3 They warstled up, they warstled down, The lee-lang simmer's day; 4 ‘O lift me up upon your back, Tak me to yon wall fair; You'll wash my bluidy wounds oer and oer, And syne they'll bleed nae mair. 5 ‘And ye'll tak aff my hollin sark, And riv't frae gair to gair; Ye'll stap it in my bluidy wounds, And syne they'll bleed nae mair.’ 6 He's liftit his brother upon his back, Taen him to yon wall fair; He's washed his bluidy wounds oer and oer, But ay they bled mair and mair. 7 And he's taen aff his hollin sark, And riven't frae gair to gair; He's stappit it in his bluidy wounds, But ay they bled mair and mair. 8 ‘Ye'll lift me up upon your back, Tak me to Kirkland fair; Ye'll mak my greaf baith braid and lang, And lay my body there. 9 ‘Ye'll lay my arrows at my head, My bent bow at my feet, My sword and buckler at my side, As I was wont to sleep. 10 ‘Whan ye gae hame to your father, He'll speer for his son John: Say, ye left him into Kirkland fair, Learning the school alone. 11 ‘When ye gae hame to my sister, She'll speer for her brother John: Ye'll say, ye left him in Kirkland fair, The green grass growin aboon. 12 ‘Whan ye gae hame to my true-love, She'll speer for her lord John: Ye'll say, ye left him in Kirkland fair, But hame ye fear he'll never come.’ 13 He's gane hame to his father; He speered for his son John: ‘It's I left him into Kirkland fair, Learning the school alone.’ 14 And whan he gaed hame to his sister, She speered for her brother John: ‘It's I left him into Kirkland fair, The green grass growin aboon.’ 15 And whan he gaed home to his true-love, She speerd for her lord John: ‘It's I left him into Kirkland fair, And hame I fear he'll never come.’ 16 ‘But whaten bluid's that on your sword, Willie? Sweet Willie, tell to me;’ ‘O it is the bluid o my grey hounds, They wadna rin for me.’ 17 ‘It's nae the bluid o your hounds, Willie, Their bluid was never so red; But it is the bluid o my true-love, That ye hae slain indeed.’ 18 That fair may wept, that fair may mournd, That fair may mournd and pin'd: ‘When every lady looks for her love, I neer need look for mine.’ 19 ‘O whaten a death will ye die, Willie?

O dear son, tell to me;’ ‘It is the blude o my gude gray steed, He wadna ride wi me.’ 13 ‘O thy steed's blude was neer sae red, Nor eer sae dear to me: O what blude's this upon your cheek?

Dear Willie, tell to me;’ ‘When sun and mune leap on yon hill, And that will never be.’ 18 She turnd hersel right round about, And her heart burst into three: ‘My ae best son is deid and gane, And my tother ane I'll neer see.’ The Two Brothers THE TWA BROTHERS—F Buchan's MSS, I, 57; Motherwell's MS., p. 662. 1 There were twa brothers in the east, Went to the school o Ayr; The one unto the other did say, Come let us wrestle here. 2 They wrestled up and wrestled down, Till John fell to the ground; There being a knife in Willie's pocket, Gae John his deadly wound. 3 ‘O is it for my gold, brother? Or for my white monie? Or is it for my lands sae braid, That ye hae killed me?’ 4 ‘It is not for your gold,’ he said, ‘Nor for your white monie; It is by the hand o accident That I hae killed thee.’ 5 ‘Ye'll take the shirt that's on my back, Rive it frae gair to gair, And try to stop my bloody wounds, For they bleed wonderous sair.’ 6 He's taen the shirt was on his back, Reave it frae gare to gare, And tried to stop his bleeding wounds, But still they bled the mair. 7 ‘Ye'll take me up upon your back, Carry me to yon water clear, And try to stop my bloody wounds, For they run wonderous sair.’ 8 He's taen him up upon his back, Carried him to yon water clear, And tried to stop his bleeding wounds, But still they bled the mair. 9 ‘Ye'll take me up upon your back, Carry me to yon church-yard; Ye'll dig a grave baith wide and deep, And then ye'll lay me there. 10 ‘Ye'll put a head-stane at my head, Another at my feet, Likewise a sod on my breast-bane, The souner I may sleep. 11 ‘Whenever my father asks of thee, Saying, What's become of John? Ye'll tell frae me, I'm ower the sea, For a cargo of good wine. 12 ‘And when my sweetheart asks of thee, Saying, What's become of John? Ye'll tell frae me, I'm ower the sea, To buy a wedding gown. 13 ‘And when my sister asks of thee, Saying, William, where is John? Ye'll tell frae me, I'm ower the sea, To learn some merry sang. 14 ‘And when my mother asks of thee, Saying, William, where is John? Tell her I'm buried in green Fordland, The grass growing ower my tomb.’ 15 He's taen him up upon his back, Carried him to yon church-yard, And dug a grave baith wide and deep, And he was buried there. 16 He laid a head-stane at his head, Another at his feet, And laid a green sod on his breast, The souner he might sleep. 17 His father asked when he came hame, Saying, ‘William, where is John?’ Then John said, ‘He is ower the sea, To bring you hame some wine.’ 18 ‘What blood is this upon you, William, And looks sae red on thee?’ ‘It is the blood o my grey-hound, He woudna run for me.’ 19 ‘O that's nae like your grey-hound's blude, William, that I do see; I fear it is your own brother's blood That looks sae red on thee.’ 20 ‘That is not my own brother's blude, Father, that ye do see; It is the blood o my good grey steed, He woudna carry me.’ 21 ‘O that is nae your grey steed's blude, William, that I do see; It is the blood o your brother John, That looks sae red on thee.’ 22 ‘It's nae the blood o my brother John, Father, that ye do see; It is the blude o my good grey hawk, Because he woudna flee.’ 23 ‘O that is nae your grey hawk's blood, William, that I do see:’ ‘Well, it's the blude o my brother, This country I maun flee.’ 24 ‘O when will ye come back again, My dear son, tell to me?’ ‘When sun and moon gae three times round, And this will never be.’ 25 ‘Ohon, alas! now William, my son, This is bad news to me; Your brother's death I'll aye bewail, And the absence o thee.’ John and William THE TWA BROTHERS—G a.

Or will you come down to yonder, yonder town Where the maids are all playing ball, ball, ball, Where the maids are all playing ball? 2 Says William to John, I will not try a fight, Nor will I throw a stone, Nor will I come down to yonder town, Where the maids are all playing ball. 3 So John took out of his pocket A knife both long and sharp, And stuck it through his brother's heart, And the blood came pouring down. 4 Says John to William, Take off thy shirt, And tear it from gore to gore, And wrap it round your bleeding heart, And the blood will pour no more.’ 5 So John took off his shirt, And tore it from gore to gore, And wrapped it round his bleeding heart, And the blood came pouring more. 6 ‘What shall I tell your dear father, When I go home to-night?’ ‘You'll tell him I'm dead and in my grave, For the truth must be told.’ 7 ‘What shall I tell your dear mother, When I go home to-night?’ ‘You'll tell her I'm dead and in my grave, For the truth must be told.’ 8 ‘How came this blood upon your knife? My son, come tell to me;’ ‘It is the blood of a rabbit I have killed, O mother, pardon me.’ 9 ‘The blood of a rabbit couldnt be so pure, My son, come tell to me:’ ‘It is the blood of a squirrel I have killed, O mother, pardon me.’ 10 ‘The blood of a squirrel couldnt be so pure, My son, come tell to me:’ ‘It is the blood of a brother I have killed, O mother, pardon me.’ Perthshire Tredgey THE TWA BROTHERS—H From a copy formerly in the possession of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. “Copied 1823” is endorsed on the sheet (in the hand which made an insertion in st. 11) and crossed out. 1 Two pretty boys lived in the North, The went to the school so rare; The one unto the other said, We'll try some battle of war. 2 The worselaid up, the worselaid down, Till John lay on the ground; A pen-knife out of William's pocket Gave John a deadly wound. 3 ‘O is it for my gold?’ he said, ‘Or for my rich monie?

THE KING'S DOCHTER LADY JEAN—B Motherwell's MS., p. 275; the first six lines in Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 189. From Margery Johnston. 1 Lady Margaret sits in her bow-window, Sewing her silken seam; 2 She's drapt the thimble at her tae, And her scissars at her heel, And she's awa to the merry green-wood, To see the leaves grow green. 3 She had scarsely bowed a branch, Or plucked a nut frae the tree, Till up and starts a fair young man, And a fair young man was he. 4 ‘How dare ye shake the leaves?’ he said, ‘How dare ye break the tree? How dare ye pluck the nuts,’ he said, ‘Without the leave of me?’ 5 ‘Oh I know the merry green wood's my ain, And I'll ask the leave of nane.’ 6 He gript her by the middle sae sma, He gently sat her down, While the grass grew up on every side, And the apple trees hang down. 7 She says, Young man, what is your name? For ye've brought me to meikle shame; For I am the king's youngest daughter, And how shall I gae hame? 8 ‘If you're the king's youngest daughter, It's I'm his auldest son, And heavy heavy is the deed, sister, That you and I have done.’ 9 He had a penknife in his hand, Hang low down by his gair, And between the long rib and the short one He woundit her deep and sair. 10 And fast and fast her ruddy bright blood Fell drapping on the ground. 11 She took the glove off her right hand, And slowly slipt it in the wound, And slowly has she risen up, And slowly slipped home. 12 ‘O sister dear, when thou gaes hame Unto thy father's ha, It's make my bed baith braid and lang, Wi the sheets as white as snaw.’ 13 ‘When I came by the high church-yard Heavy was the stain that bruised my heel, that bruised my heart, I'm afraid it shall neer heal.’ Castle Ha's Daughter THE KING'S DOCHTER LADY JEAN—C Buchan's Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland, I, 241. 1 As Annie sat into her bower, A thought came in her head, That she would gang to gude greenwood, Across the flowery mead. 2 She hadna pu'd a flower, a flower, Nor broken a branch but twa, Till by it came a gentle squire, Says, Lady, come awa. 3 There's nane that comes to gude greenwood But pays to me a tein, And I maun hae your maidenhead, Or than your mantle green. 4 ‘My mantle's o the finest silk, Anither I can spin; But gin you take my maidenhead, The like I'll never fin.’ 5 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, There laid her low in gude greenwood, And at her spierd nae leave. 6 When he had got his wills o her, His wills as he had taen, She said, If you rightly knew my birth, Ye'd better letten alane. 7 ‘Is your father a lord o might? Or baron o high degree? Or what race are ye sprung frae, That I should lat ye be?’ 8 ‘O I am Castle Ha's daughter, O birth and high degree, And if he knows what ye hae done, He'll hang you on a tree.’ 9 ‘If ye be Castle Ha's daughter, This day I am undone; If ye be Castle Ha's daughter, I am his only son.’ 10 ‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye jelly hind squire, Sae loud as I hear you lie, Castle Ha, he has but ae dear son, And he is far beyond the sea.’ 11 ‘O I am Castle Ha's dear son, A word I dinna lie; Yes, I am Castle Ha's dear son, And new come oer the sea. 12 ‘'Twas yesterday, that fatal day, That I did cross the faem; I wish my bonny ship had sunk, And I had neer come hame.’ 13 Then dowie, dowie, raise she up, And dowie came she hame, And stripped aff her silk mantle, And then to bed she's gane. 14 Then in it came her mother dear, And she steps in the fleer: ‘Win up, win up, now fair Annie, What makes your lying here?’ 15 ‘This morning fair, as I went out, Near by yon castle wa, Great and heavy was the stane That on my foot did fa.’ 16 ‘Hae I nae ha's, hae I nae bowers, Towers, or mony a town? Will not these cure your bonny foot, Gar you gae hale and soun?’ 17 ‘Ye hae ha's, and ye hae bowers, And towers, and mony a town, But nought will cure my bonny foot, Gar me gang hale and soun.’ 18 Then in it came her father dear, And he trips in the fleer: ‘Win up, win up, now fair Annie, What makes your lying here?’ 19 ‘This morning fair, as I went out, Near by yon castle wa, Great and heavy was the stane That on my foot did fa.’ 20 ‘Hae I nae ha's, hae I nae bowers, And towers, and mony a town? Will not these cure your bonny foot, Gar you gang hale and soun?’ 21 ‘O ye hae ha's, and ye hae bowers, And towers, and mony a town, But nought will cure my bonny foot, Gar me gang hale and soun.’ 22 Then in it came her sister Grace; As she steps in the fleer, ‘Win up, win up, now fair Annie, What makes your lying here? 23 ‘Win up, and see your ae brother, That's new come ower the sea;’ ‘Ohon, alas!’ says fair Annie, ‘He spake ower soon wi me.’ 24 To her room her brother's gane, Stroked back her yellow hair, To her lips his ain did press, But words spake never mair.

Bold Burnet has but ae dear son, He's sailing on the sea.’ 8 ‘Yesterday, about this same time, My bonny ship came to land; I wish she'd sunken in the sea, And never seen the strand! 9 ‘Heal well this deed on me, lady, Heal well this deed on me!’ ‘Although I would heal it neer sae well, Our God above does see.’ 10 She's taen her mantle her middle about, And mourning went she hame, And a' the way she sighd full sair, Crying, Am I to blame! 11 Ben it came her father dear, Stout stepping on the flear: ‘Win up, win up, my daughter Janet, And welcome your brother here.’ 12 Up she's taen her milk-white hand, Streakd by his yellow hair, Then turnd about her bonny face, And word spake never mair. 53 YOUNG BEICHAN Young Bicham YOUNG BEICHAN—A Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 13. 1 In London city was Bicham born, He longd strange countries for to see, But he was taen by a savage Moor, Who handld him right cruely. 2 For thro his shoulder he put a bore, An thro the bore has pitten a tree, An he's gard him draw the carts o wine, Where horse and oxen had wont to be. 3 He's casten [him] in a dungeon deep, Where he coud neither hear nor see; He's shut him up in a prison strong, An he's handld him right cruely. 4 O this Moor he had but ae daughter, I wot her name was Shusy Pye; She's doen her to the prison-house, And she's calld Young Bicham one word by. 5 ‘O hae ye ony lands or rents, Or citys in your ain country, Coud free you out of prison strong, An coud mantain a lady free?’ 6 ‘O London city is my own, An other citys twa or three, Coud loose me out o prison strong, An coud mantain a lady free.’ 7 O she has bribed her father's men Wi meikle goud and white money, She's gotten the key o the prison doors, An she has set Young Bicham free. 8 She's gi'n him a loaf o good white bread, But an a flask o Spanish wine, An she bad him mind on the ladie's love That sae kindly freed him out o pine. 9 ‘Go set your foot on good ship-board, An haste you back to your ain country, An before that seven years has an end, Come back again, love, and marry me.’ 10 It was long or seven years had an end She longd fu sair her love to see; She's set her foot on good ship-board, An turnd her back on her ain country. 11 She's saild up, so has she doun, Till she came to the other side; She's landed at Young Bicham's gates, An I hop this day she sal be his bride. 12 ‘Is this Young Bicham's gates?’ says she, ‘Or is that noble prince within?’ ‘He's up the stairs wi his bonny bride, An monny a lord and lady wi him.’ 13 ‘O has he taen a bonny bride, An has he clean forgotten me!’ An sighing said that gay lady, I wish I were in my ain country! 14 But she's pitten her han in her pocket, An gin the porter guineas three; Says, Take ye that, ye proud porter, An bid the bridegroom speak to me. 15 O whan the porter came up the stair, He's fa'n low down upon his knee: ‘Won up, won up, ye proud porter, An what makes a' this courtesy?’ 16 ‘O I've been porter at your gates This mair nor seven years an three, But there is a lady at them now The like of whom I never did see. 17 ‘For on every finger she has a ring, An on the mid-finger she has three, An there's as meikle goud aboon her brow As woud buy an earldome o lan to me.’ 18 Then up it started Young Bicham, An sware so loud by Our Lady, ‘It can be nane but Shusy Pye, That has come oer the sea to me.’ 19 O quickly ran he down the stair, O fifteen steps he has made but three; He's tane his bonny love in his arms, An a wot he kissd her tenderly. 20 ‘O hae you tane a bonny bride?

Young Brechin YOUNG BEICHAN—B Glenriddell MSS, XI, 80. 1 In England was Young Brechin born, Of parents of a high degree; The selld him to the savage Moor, Where they abused him maist cruellie. 2 Thro evry shoulder they bord a bore, And thro evry bore they pat a tree; They made him draw the carts o wine, Which horse and owsn were wont to drie. 3 The pat him into prison strong, Where he could neither hear nor see; They pat him in a dark dungeon, Where he was sick and like to die. 4 ‘Is there neer an auld wife in this town That'll borrow me to be her son? Is there neer a young maid in this town Will take me for her chiefest one?’ 5 A Savoyen has an only daughter, I wat she's called Young Brichen by; ‘O sleepst thou, wakest thou, Brichen?’ she says, ‘Or who is't that does on me cry? 6 ‘O hast thou any house or lands, Or hast thou any castles free, That thou wadst gi to a lady fair That out o prison wad bring thee?’ 7 ‘O lady, Lundin it is mine, And other castles twa or three; These I wad gie to a lady fair That out of prison wad set me free.’ 8 She's taen him by the milk-white hand, And led him to a towr sae hie, She's made him drink the wine sae reid, And sung to him like a mavosie. 9 O these two luvers made a bond, For seven years, and that is lang, That he was to marry no other wife, And she's to marry no other man. 10 When seven years were past and gane, This young lady began to lang, And she's awa to Lundin gane, To see if Brechin's got safe to land. 11 When she came to Young Brechin's yett, She chappit gently at the gin; ‘Is this Young Brechin's yett?’ she says, ‘Or is this lusty lord within?’ ‘O yes, this is Lord Brechin's yett, And I wat this be his bridal een.’ 12 She's put her hand in her pocket, And thrawin the porter guineas three; ‘Gang up the stair, young man,’ she says, ‘And bid your master come down to me. 13 ‘Bid him bring a bite o his ae best bread, And a bottle o his ae best wine, And neer forget that lady fair That did him out o prison bring.’ 14 The porter tripped up the stair, And fell low down upon his knee: ‘Rise up, rise up, ye proud porter, What mean you by this courtesie?’ 15 ‘O I hae been porter at your yett This thirty years and a' but three; There stands the fairest lady thereat That ever my twa een did see. 16 ‘On evry finger she has a ring, On her mid-finger she has three; She's as much gold on her horse's neck As wad by a earldom o land to me. 17 ‘She bids you send o your ae best bread, And a bottle o your ae best wine, And neer forget the lady fair That out o prison did you bring.’ 18 He's taen the table wi his foot, And made the cups and cans to flee: ‘I'll wager a' the lands I hae That Susan Pye's come oer the sea.’ 19 Then up and spak the bride's mother: ‘And O an ill deid may ye die! If ye didna except the bonny bride, Ye might hae ay excepted me.’ 20 ‘O ye are fair, and fair, madam, And ay the fairer may ye be! But the fairest day that eer ye saw, Ye were neer sae fair as yon lady.’ 21 O when these lovers two did meet, The tear it blinded baith their ee; ‘Gie me my faith and troth,’ she says, ‘For now fain hame wad I be.’ 22 ‘Tak hame your daughter, madam,’ he says, ‘She's neer a bit the war o me; Except a kiss o her bonny lips, Of her body I am free; She came to me on a single horse, Now I'll send her hame in chariots three.’ 23 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And he's led her to a yard o stane; He's changed her name frae Susan Pye, And calld her lusty Lady Jane. Young Bekie YOUNG BEICHAN—C a. Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 11. b. Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 127. 1 Young Bekie was as brave a knight As ever saild the sea; An he's doen him to the court of France, To serve for meat and fee. 2 He had nae been i the court of France A twelvemonth nor sae long, Til he fell in love with the king's daughter, An was thrown in prison strong. 3 The king he had but ae daughter, Burd Isbel was her name; An she has to the prison-house gane, To hear the prisoner's mane. 4 ‘O gin a lady woud borrow me, At her stirrup-foot I woud rin; Or gin a widow wad borrow me, I woud swear to be her son. 5 ‘Or gin a virgin woud borrow me, I woud wed her wi a ring; I'd gi her ha's, I'd gie her bowers, The bonny towrs o Linne.’ 6 O barefoot, barefoot gaed she but, An barefoot came she ben; It was no for want o hose an shoone, Nor time to put them on. 7 But a' for fear that her father dear Had heard her making din: She's stown the keys o the prison-house dor An latten the prisoner gang. 8 O whan she saw him, Young Bekie, Her heart was wondrous sair! For the mice but an the bold rottons Had eaten his yallow hair. 9 She's gien him a shaver for his beard, A comber till his hair, Five hunder pound in his pocket, To spen, an nae to spair. 10 She's gien him a steed was good in need, An a saddle o royal bone, A leash o hounds o ae litter, An Hector called one. 11 Atween this twa a vow was made, 'Twas made full solemnly, That or three years was come an gane, Well married they shoud be. 12 He had nae been in's ain country A twelvemonth till an end, Till he's forcd to marry a duke's daughter, Or than lose a' his land. 13 ‘Ohon, alas!’ says Young Beckie, ‘I know not what to dee; For I canno win to Burd Isbel, And she kensnae to come to me.’ 14 O it fell once upon a day Burd Isbel fell asleep, An up it starts the Belly Blin, An stood at her bed-feet. 15 ‘O waken, waken, Burd Isbel, How [can] you sleep so soun, Whan this is Bekie's wedding day, An the marriage gain on? 16 ‘Ye do ye to your mither's bowr, Think neither sin nor shame; An ye tak twa o your mither's marys, To keep ye frae thinking lang. 17 ‘Ye dress yoursel in the red scarlet, An your marys in dainty green, An ye pit girdles about your middles Woud buy an earldome. 18 ‘O ye gang down by yon sea-side, An down by yon sea-stran; Sae bonny will the Hollans boats Come rowin till your han. 19 ‘Ye set your milk-white foot abord, Cry, Hail ye, Domine! An I shal be the steerer o't, To row you oer the sea.’ 20 She's tane her till her mither's bowr, Thought neither sin nor shame, An she took twa o her mither's marys, To keep her frae thinking lang. 21 She dressd hersel i the red scarlet, Her marys i dainty green, And they pat girdles about their middles Woud buy an earldome. 22 An they gid down by yon sea-side, An down by yon sea-stran; Sae bonny did the Hollan boats Come rowin to their han. 23 She set her milk-white foot on board, Cried, Hail ye, Domine! An the Belly Blin was the steerer o't, To row her oer the sea. 24 Whan she came to Young Bekie's gate, She heard the music play; Sae well she kent frae a' she heard, It was his wedding day. 25 She's pitten her han in her pocket, Gin the porter guineas three; ‘Hae, tak ye that, ye proud porter, Bid the bride-groom speake to me.’ 26 O whan that he cam up the stair, He fell low down on his knee: He haild the king, an he haild the queen, An he haild him, Young Bekie. 27 ‘O I've been porter at your gates This thirty years an three; But there's three ladies at them now, Their like I never did see. 28 ‘There's ane o them dressd in red scarlet, And twa in dainty green, An they hae girdles about their middles Woud buy an earldome.’ 29 Then out it spake the bierly bride, Was a' goud to the chin; ‘Gin she be braw without,’ she says, ‘We's be as braw within.’ 30 Then up it starts him, Young Bekie, An the tears was in his ee: ‘I'll lay my life it's Burd Isbel, Come oer the sea to me.’ 31 O quickly ran he down the stair, An whan he saw 'twas shee, He kindly took her in his arms, And kissd her tenderly. 32 ‘O hae ye forgotten, Young Bekie, The vow ye made to me, Whan I took you out o the prison strong, Whan ye was condemnd to die? 33 ‘I gae you a steed was good in need, An a saddle o royal bone, A leash o hounds o ae litter, An Hector called one.’ 34 It was well kent what the lady said, That it wasnae a lee, For at ilka word the lady spake, The hound fell at her knee. 35 ‘Tak hame, tak hame your daughter dear, A blessing gae her wi, For I maun marry my Burd Isbel, That's come oer the sea to me.’ 36 ‘Is this the custom o your house, Or the fashion o your lan, To marry a maid in a May mornin, An send her back at even?’ Young Beachen YOUNG BEICHAN—D “The Old Lady's Collection,” from which it was copied by Skene, No. 14. 1 Young Beachen as born in fair London, An foiren lands he langed to see, An he was tean by the savage Mour, An they used him mast cruely. 2 Throu his shoulder they patt a bore, An throu the bore they patt a tree, An they made him tralle ther ousen-carts, An they used him most cruelly. 3 The savige More had ae doughter, I wat her name was Susan Pay, An she is to the prison-house To hear the prisenor's mone. 4 He made na his mone to a stok, He made it no to a ston, But it was to the Quin of Heaven, That he made his mone. 5 ‘Gine a lady wad borrou me, Att her foot I wad rune, An a widdou wad borrou me, I wad becom her sone. 6 ‘Bat an a maid wad borrou me, I wad wed her we a ring, I wad make her lady of haas an bours, An of the high tours of Line.’ 7 ‘Sing our yer sang, Young Bichen,’ she says, ‘Sing our yer sang to me;’ ‘I never sang that sang, lady, Bat fat I wad sing to ye. 8 ‘An a lady wad borrou me, Att her foot I wad rune, An a widdou wad borrou me, I wad becom her son. 9 ‘Bat an a maid wad borrou me, I wad wed her we a ring, I wad mak her lady of haas an bours, An of the high tours of Line.’ 10 Saftly gaid she but, An saftly gaid she ben; It was na for want of hose nor shone, Nor time to pit them on. 11 An she has stoun the kees of the prison, An latten Young Beachen gang. 12 She gae him a lofe of her whit bread, An a bottel of her wine, She bad him mind on the leady's love That fread him out of pine. 13 She gae him a stead was gued in time of nead, A sadle of the bone, Five hundred poun in his poket, Bad him gae speading home. 14 An a lish of gued gray honds, 15 Fan seven lang year wer come an gane, Shusie Pay thought lang, An she is on to fair London, As fast as she could gang. 16 Fan she came to Young Beachen's gate, ‘Is Young Beachen att home, Or is he in this country?’ 17 ‘He is att home, [H]is bearly bride him we;’ Sighan says her Susë Pay, ‘Was he quit forgoten me?’ 18 On every finger she had a ring, An on the middel finger three; She gave the porter on of them, ‘Gett a word of your lord to me.’ 19 He gaed up the stare, Fell lau doun on his knee: ‘Win up, my proud porter, What is your will we [me]?’ 20 ‘I ha ben porter att your gate This therty year an three; The fairest lady is att yer gate Mine eays did ever see.’ 21 Out spak the brid's mother, An a haghty woman was she; ‘If ye had not excepted the bonny brid, Ye might well ha excepted me.’ 22 ‘No desparegment to you, madam, Nor non to her grace; The sol of yon lady's foot Is fairer then yer face.’ 23 He's geen the table we his foot, An caped it we his knee: ‘I wad my head an a' my land It's Susie Pay come over the sea.’ 24 The stare was therty steps, I wat he made them three; He toke her in his arms tua, ‘Susie Pay, y'er welcom to me!’ 25 ‘Gie me a shive of your whit bread, An a bottel of your wine; Dinner ye mind on the lady's love That freed ye out of pine?’ 26 He took her Doun to yon garden green, An changed her name fra Shusie Pay, An called her bonny Lady Jean. 27 ‘Yer daughter came hear on high hors-back, She sall gae hame in coaches three, An I sall dubel her tocher our, She is nean the war of me.’ 28 ‘It's na the fashon of our country, Nor yet of our name, To wed a may in the morning An send her hame att none.’ 29 ‘It's na the fashon of my country, Nor of my name, Bat I man mind on the lady's love That freed me out of pine.’ Young Beichan and Susie Pye YOUNG BEICHAN—E Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 117, compounded from A, a manuscript and a stall copy from Scotland, a recited copy from the north of England, and a short version picked off a wall in London. (The parts which repeat A are in smaller type.) 1 In London was Young Beichan born, He longed strange countries for to see, But he was taen by a savage Moor, Who handled him right cruellie. 2 For he viewed the fashions of that land, Their way of worship viewed he, But to Mahound or Termagant Would Beichan never bend a knee. 3 So in every shoulder they've putten a bore, In every bore they've putten a tree, And they have made him trail the wine And spices on his fair bodie. 4 They've casten him in a dungeon deep, Where he could neither hear nor see, For seven years they kept him there, Till he for hunger's like to die. 5 This Moor he had but ae daughter, Her name was called Susie Pye, And every day as she took the air, Near Beichan's prison she passed by. 6 O so it fell upon a day She heard Young Beichan sadly sing: ‘My hounds they all go masterless, My hawks they flee from tree to tree, My younger brother will heir my land, Fair England again I'll never see!’ 7 All night long no rest she got, Young Beichan's song for thinking on; She's stown the keys from her father's head, And to the prison strong is gone. 8 And she has opend the prison doors, I wot she opend two or three, Ere she could come Young Beichan at, He was locked up so curiouslie. 9 But when she came Young Beichan before, Sore wonderd he that may to see; He took her for some fair captive: ‘Fair Lady, I pray, of what countrie?’ 10 ‘O have ye any lands,’ she said, ‘Or castles in your own countrie, That ye could give to a lady fair, From prison strong to set you free?’ 11 ‘Near London town I have a hall, With other castles two or three; I'll give them all to the lady fair That out of prison will set me free.’ 12 ‘Give me the truth of your right hand, The truth of it give unto me, That for seven years ye'll no lady wed, Unless it be along with me.’ 13 ‘I'll give thee the truth of my right hand, The truth of it I'll freely gie, That for seven years I'll stay unwed, For the kindness thou dost show to me.’ 14 And she has brib'd the proud warder Wi mickle gold and white monie, She's gotten the keys of the prison strong, And she has set Young Beichan free. 15 She's gien him to eat the good spice-cake, She's gien him to drink the blood-red wine, She's bidden him sometimes think on her, That sae kindly freed him out of pine. 16 She's broken a ring from her finger, And to Beichan half of it gave she: ‘Keep it, to mind you of that love The lady bore that set you free. 17 ‘And set your foot on good ship-board, And haste ye back to your own countrie, And before that seven years have an end, Come back again, love, and marry me.’ 18 But long ere seven years had an end, She longd full sore her love to see, For ever a voice within her breast Said, ‘Beichan has broke his vow to thee:’ So she's set her foot on good ship-board, And turnd her back on her own countrie. 19 She sailed east, she sailed west, Till to fair England's shore she came, Where a bonny shepherd she espied, Feeding his sheep upon the plain. 20 ‘What news, what news, thou bonny shepherd? What news hast thou to tell to me?’ ‘Such news I hear, ladie,’ he says, ‘The like was never in this countrie. 21 ‘There is a wedding in yonder hall, Has lasted these thirty days and three; Young Beichan will not bed with his bride, For love of one that's yond the sea.’ 22 She's put her hand in her pocket, Gien him the gold and white monie: ‘Hae, take ye that, my bonny boy, For the good news thou tellst to me.’ 23 When she came to Young Beichan's gate, She tirled softly at the pin; So ready was the proud porter To open and let this lady in. 24 ‘Is this Young Beichan's hall,’ she said, ‘Or is that noble lord within?’ ‘Yea, he's in the hall among them all, And this is the day o his weddin.’ 25 ‘And has he wed anither love? And has he clean forgotten me?’ And sighin said that gay ladie, I wish I were in my own countrie! 26 And she has taen her gay gold ring, That with her love she brake so free; Says, Gie him that, ye proud porter, And bid the bridegroom speak to me. 27 When the porter came his lord before, He kneeled down low on his knee: ‘What aileth thee, my proud porter, Thou art so full of courtesie?’ 28 ‘I've been porter at your gates, It's thirty long years now and three; But there stands a lady at them now, The like o her did I never see. 29 ‘For on every finger she has a ring, And on her mid-finger she has three, And as meickle gold aboon her brow As would buy an earldom to me.’ 30 It's out then spak the bride's mother, Aye and an angry woman was shee: ‘Ye might have excepted our bonny bride, And twa or three of our companie.’ 31 ‘O hold your tongue, thou bride's mother, Of all your folly let me be; She's ten times fairer nor the bride, And all that's in your companie. 32 ‘She begs one sheave of your white bread, But and a cup of your red wine, And to remember the lady's love That last relievd you out of pine.’ 33 ‘O well-a-day!’ said Beichan then, ‘That I so soon have married thee! For it can be none but Susie Pye, That sailed the sea for love of me.’ 34 And quickly hied he down the stair; Of fifteen steps he made but three; He's taen his bonny love in his arms, And kist and kist her tenderlie. 35 ‘O hae ye taen anither bride? And hae ye quite forgotten me? And hae ye quite forgotten her That gave you life and libertie?’ 36 She looked oer her left shoulder, To hide the tears stood in her ee: ‘Now fare thee well, Young Beichan,’ she says, ‘I'll try to think no more on thee.’ 37 ‘O never, never, Susie Pye, For surely this can never be, Nor ever shall I wed but her That's done and dreed so much for me.’ 38 Then out and spak the forenoon bride: ‘My lord, your love it changeth soon; This morning I was made your bride, And another chose ere it be noon.’ 39 O hold thy tongue, thou forenoon bride, Ye're neer a whit the worse for me, And whan ye return to your own countrie, A double dower I'll send with thee.’ 40 He's taen Susie Pye by the white hand, And gently led her up and down, And ay as he kist her red rosy lips, ‘Ye're welcome, jewel, to your own.’ 41 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And led her to yon fountain stane; He's changed her name from Susie Pye, And he's call'd her his bonny love, Lady Jane. Susan Pye and Lord Beichan YOUNG BEICHAN—F Pitcairn's MSS, III, 159, 1817-25. From the recitation of Widow Stevenson, aged seventy-three: “East Country.” 1 In the lands where Lord Beichan was born, Amang the stately steps of stane, He wore the goud at his left shoulder, But to the Holy Land he's gane. 2 He was na lang in the Holy Land, Amang the Prudents that was black, He was na lang in the Holy Land, Till the Prudent did Lord Beichan tak. 3 The gard him draw baith pleugh and harrow, And horse and oxen twa or three; They cast him in a dark dungeon, Whare he coud neither hear nor see. 4 The Prudent had a fair daughter, I wot they ca'd her Susy Pye, And all the keys in that city Hang at that lady by and bye. 5 It once fell out upon a day That into the prison she did gae, And whan she cam to the prison door, She kneeled low down on her knee. 6 ‘O hae ye ony lands, Beichan, Or hae ye ony castles hie, Whar ye wad tak a young thing to, If out of prison I wad let thee?’ 7 ‘Fair London's mine, dear lady,’ he said, ‘And other places twa or three, Whar I wad tak a young thing to, If out of prison ye wad let me.’ 8 O she has opened the prison door, And other places twa or three, And gien him bread, and wine to drink, In her own chamber privately. 9 O then she built a bonny ship, And she has set it on the main, And she has built a bonny ship, It's for to tak Lord Beichan hame. 10 O she's gaen murning up and down, And she's gaen murnin to the sea, Then to her father she has gane in, Wha spak to her right angrily. 11 ‘O do ye mourn for the goud, daughter, Or do ye mourn for the whyte monie? Or do ye mourn for the English squire? I wat I will gar hang him hie.’ 12 ‘I neither mourn for the goud, father, Nor do I for the whyte monie, Nor do I for the English squire; And I care na tho ye hang him hie. 13 ‘But I hae promised an errand to go, Seven lang miles ayont the sea, And blythe and merry I never will be Untill that errand you let me.’ 14 ‘That errand, daughter, you may gang, Seven long miles beyond the sea, Since blythe and merry you'll neer be Untill that errand I'll let thee.’ 15 O she has built a bonny ship, And she has set it in the sea, And she has built a bonny ship, It's all for to tak her a long journie. 16 And she's sailed a' the summer day, I wat the wind blew wondrous fair; In sight of fair London she has come, And till Lord Beichan's yett she walked. 17 Whan she cam till Lord Beichan's yett, She rappit loudly at the pin: ‘Is Beichan lord of this bonny place? I pray ye open and let me in. 18 ‘And O is this Lord Beichan's yett, And is the noble lord within?’ ‘O yes, it is Lord Beichan's yett, He's wi his bride and mony a ane.’ 19 ‘If you'll gang up to Lord Beichan, Tell him the words that I tell thee; It will put him in mind of Susy Pye, And the Holy Land, whareer he be. 20 ‘Tell him to send one bite of bread, It's and a glass of his gude red wine, Nor to forget the lady's love That loosed him out of prison strong.’ 21 ‘I hae been porter at your yett, I'm sure this therty lang years and three, But the fairest lady stands thereat That evir my twa eyes did see. 22 ‘On ilka finger she has a ring, And on the foremost she has three; As muckle goud is on her head As wad buy an earldom of land to thee. 23 ‘She bids you send a bite of bread, It's and a glass of your gude red wine, Nor to forget the lady's love That let you out of prison strong.’ 24 It's up and spak the bride's mother, A weight of goud hung at her chin: ‘There is no one so fair without But there are, I wat, as fair within.’ 25 It's up and spak the bride hersel, As she sat by the gude lord's knee: ‘Awa, awa, ye proud porter, This day ye might hae excepted me.’ 26 ‘Tak hence, tak hence your fair daughter, Tak hame your daughter fair frae me; For saving one kiss of her bonny lips, I'm sure of her body I am free. 27 ‘Awa, awa, ye proud mither, It's tak your daughter fair frae me; For I brought her home with chariots six, And I'll send her back wi coaches three.’ 28 It's he's taen the table wi his fit, And syne he took it wi his knee; He gard the glasses and wine so red, He gard them all in flinders flee. 29 O he's gane down the steps of stairs, And a' the stately steps of stane, Until he cam to Susy Pye; I wat the tears blinded baith their eyne. 30 He led her up the steps of stairs, And a' the stately steps of stane, And changed her name from Susy Pye, And ca'd her lusty Lady Jane. 31 ‘O fye, gar cooks mak ready meat, O fye, gar cooks the pots supply, That it may be talked of in fair London, I've been twice married in ae day.’ YOUNG BEICHAN—G Communicated by Mr Alexander Laing, of Newburg-on-Tay, as derived from the recitation of Miss Walker. 1 ‘O wha's aught a' yon flock o sheep, An wha's aught a' yon flock o kye?

It's what wad ye gie to the ladie fair Wha out o prison wad set you free?’ 14 ‘It's I hae houses, and I hae lands, Wi monie castles fair to see, And I wad gie a' to that ladie gay, Wha out o prison wad set me free.’ 15 The keeper syne brak aff his chains, And set Lord Beichan at libertie; She filld his pockets baith wi gowd, To tak him till his ain countrie. 16 She took him frae her father's prison, And gied to him the best o wine, And a brave health she drank to him: ‘I wish, Lord Beichan, ye were mine! 17 ‘It's seven lang years I'll mak a vow, And seven lang years I'll keep it true; If ye'll wed wi na ither woman, It's I will wed na man but you.’ 18 She's tane him to her father's port, And gien to him a ship o fame: ‘Farewell, farewell, my Scottish lord, I fear I'll neer see you again.’ 19 Lord Beichan turnd him round about, And lowly, lowly loutit he: ‘Ere seven lang years come to an end, I'll tak you to mine ain countrie.’ 20 Then whan he cam to Glasgow town, A happy, happy man was he; The ladies a' around him thrangd, To see him come frae slaverie. 21 His mother she had died o sorrow, And a' his brothers were dead but he; His lands they a' were lying waste, In ruins were his castles free. 22 Na porter there stood at his yett, Na human creature he could see, Except the screeching owls and bats, Had he to bear him companie. 23 But gowd will gar the castles grow, And he had gowd and jewels free, And soon the pages around him thrangd, To serve him on their bended knee. 24 His hall was hung wi silk and satin, His table rung wi mirth and glee, He soon forgot the lady fair That lowsd him out o slaverie. 25 Lord Beichan courted a lady gay, To heir wi him his lands sae free, Neer thinking that a lady fair Was on her way frae Grand Turkie. 26 For Susie Pye could get na rest, Nor day nor nicht could happy be, Still thinking on the Scottish lord, Till she was sick and like to dee. 27 But she has builded a bonnie ship, Weel mannd wi seamen o hie degree, And secretly she stept on board, And bid adieu to her ain countrie. 28 But whan she cam to the Scottish shore, The bells were ringing sae merrilie; It was Lord Beichan's wedding day, Wi a lady fair o hie degree. 29 But sic a vessel was never seen; The very masts were tappd wi gold, Her sails were made o the satin fine, Maist beautiful for to behold. 30 But whan the lady cam on shore, Attended wi her pages three, Her shoon were of the beaten gowd, And she a lady of great beautie. 31 Then to the skipper she did say, ‘Can ye this answer gie to me? Where are Lord Beichan's lands sae braid? He surely lives in this countrie.’ 32 Then up bespak the skipper bold, For he could speak the Turkish tongue: ‘Lord Beichan lives not far away; This is the day of his wedding.’ 33 ‘If ye will guide me to Beichan's yetts, I will ye well reward,’ said she; Then she and all her pages went, A very gallant companie. 34 When she cam to Lord Beichan's yetts, She tirld gently at the pin; Sae ready was the proud porter To let the wedding guests come in. 35 ‘Is this Lord Beichan's house,’ she says, ‘Or is that noble lord within?’ ‘Yes, he is gane into the hall, With his brave bride and monie ane.’ 36 ‘Ye'll bid him send me a piece of bread, Bot and a cup of his best wine; And bid him mind the lady's love That ance did lowse him out o pyne.’ 37 Then in and cam the porter bold, I wat he gae three shouts and three: ‘The fairest lady stands at your yetts That ever my twa een did see.’ 38 Then up bespak the bride's mither, I wat an angry woman was she: ‘You micht hae excepted our bonnie bride, Tho she'd been three times as fair as she.’ 39 ‘My dame, your daughter's fair enough, And aye the fairer mot she be! But the fairest time that eer she was, She'll na compare wi this ladie. 40 ‘She has a gowd ring on ilka finger, And on her mid-finger she has three; She has as meikle gowd upon her head As wad buy an earldom o land to thee. 41 ‘My lord, she begs some o your bread, Bot and a cup o your best wine, And bids you mind the lady's love That ance did lowse ye out o pyne.’ 42 Then up and started Lord Beichan, I wat he made the table flee: ‘I wad gie a' my yearlie rent 'Twere Susie Pye come owre the sea.’ 43 Syne up bespak the bride's mother, She was never heard to speak sae free: ‘Ye'll no forsake my ae dochter, Tho Susie Pye has crossd the sea?’ 44 ‘Tak hame, tak hame, your dochter, madam, For she is neer the waur o me; She cam to me on horseback riding, And she sall gang hame in chariot free.’ 45 He's tane Susie Pye by the milk-white hand, And led her thro his halls sae hie: ‘Ye're now Lord Beichan's lawful wife, And thrice ye're welcome unto me.’ 46 Lord Beichan prepard for another wedding, Wi baith their hearts sae fu o glee; Says, ‘I'll range na mair in foreign lands, Sin Susie Pye has crossd the sea. 47 ‘Fy! gar a' our cooks mak ready, And fy! gar a' our pipers play, And fy! gar trumpets gae thro the toun, That Lord Beichan's wedded twice in a day!’ YOUNG BEICHAN—I Communicated by Mr David Louden, as recited by Mrs Dodds, Morham, Haddington, the reciter being above seventy in 1873. 1 In London was Young Bechin born, Foreign nations he longed to see; He passed through many kingdoms great, At length he came unto Turkie. 2 He viewed the fashions of that land, The ways of worship viewed he, But unto any of their gods He would not so much as bow the knee. 3 On every shoulder they made a bore, In every bore they put a tree, Then they made him the winepress tread, And all in spite of his fair bodie. 4 They put him into a deep dungeon, Where he could neither hear nor see, And for seven years they kept him there, Till for hunger he was like to die. 5 Stephen, their king, had a daughter fair, Yet never a man to her came nigh; And every day she took the air, Near to his prison she passed by. 6 One day she heard Young Bechin sing A song that pleased her so well, No rest she got till she came to him, All in his lonely prison cell. 7 ‘I have a hall in London town, With other buildings two or three, And I'll give them all to the ladye fair That from this dungeon shall set me free.’ 8 She stole the keys from her dad's head, And if she oped one door ay she opened three, Till she Young Bechin could find out, He was locked up so curiouslie. 9 ‘I've been a porter at your gate This thirty years now, ay and three; There stands a ladye at your gate, The like of her I neer did see. 10 ‘On every finger she has a ring, On the mid-finger she has three; She's as much gold about her brow As would an earldom buy to me.’ 11 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, He gently led her through the green; He changed her name from Susie Pie, An he's called her lovely Ladye Jean.

Illustrated by George Cruikshank. 1839. 1 Lord Bateman was a noble lord, A noble lord of high degree; He shipped himself on board a ship, Some foreign country he would go see. 2 He sailed East, and he sailed West, Until he came to proud Turkey, When he was taken and put to prison, Until his life was almost gone. 3 And in this prison there grew a tree, It grew so stout and strong, Where he was chained by the middle, Until his life was almost gone. 4 This Turk he had one only daughter, The fairest creature my eyes did see; She stole the keys of her father's prison, And swore Lord Bateman she would set free. 5 ‘Have you got houses? Have you got lands? Or does Northumberland belong to thee? What would you give to the fair young lady That out of prison would set you free?’ 6 ‘I have got houses, I have got lands, And half Northumberland belongs to me; I'll give it all to the fair young lady That out of prison would set me free.’ 7 O then she took me to her father's hall, And gave to me the best of wine, And every health she drank unto him, ‘I wish, Lord Bateman, that you were mine! 8 ‘Now in seven years I'll make a vow, And seven years I'll keep it strong, If you'll wed with no other woman, I will wed with no other man.’ 9 O then she took him to her father's harbour, And gave to him a ship of fame: ‘Farewell, farewell to you, Lord Bateman, I'm afraid I neer shall see you again.’ 10 Now seven long years are gone and past, And fourteen days, well known to thee; She packed up all her gay clothing, And swore Lord Bateman she would go see. 11 But when she came to Lord Bateman's castle, So boldly she did ring the bell; ‘Who's there, who's there?’ cried the proud porter, ‘Who's there? come unto me tell.’ 12 ‘O is this Lord Bateman's castle? Or is his Lordship here within?’ ‘O yes, O yes,’ cried the young porter, ‘He's just now taken his new bride in.’ 13 ‘O tell him to send me a slice of bread, And a bottle of the best wine, And not forgetting the fair young lady Who did release him when close confined.’ 14 Away, away, went this proud young porter, Away, away, and away went he, Until he came to Lord Bateman's chamber; Down on his bended knees fell he. 15 ‘What news, what news, my proud young porter? What news hast thou brought unto me?’ ‘There is the fairest of all young creatures That eer my two eyes did see. 16 ‘She has got rings on every finger, And round one of them she has got three, And as much gay clothing round her As would buy all Northumberland free. 17 ‘She bids you send her a slice of bread, And a bottle of the best wine, And not forgetting the fair young lady Who did release you when close confined.’ 18 Lord Bateman he then in a passion flew, And broke his sword in splinters three, Saying, I will give all my father's riches, That if Sophia has crossed the sea. 19 Then up spoke the young bride'[s] mother, Who never was heard to speak so free: You'll not forget my only daughter, That if Sophia has crossed the sea. 20 ‘I own I made a bride of your daughter; She's neither the better or worse for me; She came to me with her horse and saddle, She may go back in her coach and three.’ 21 Lord Bateman prepared another marriage, With both their hearts so full of glee: ‘I'll range no more in foreign countries, Now since Sophia has crossed the sea.’ Pitts, Seven Dials.

Dixon, Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 1. 1 Young Bonwell was a squire's ae son, And a squire's ae son was he; He went abroad to a foreign land, To serve for meat and fee. 2 He hadna been in that country A twalmonth and a day, Till he was cast in prison strong, For the sake of a lovely may. 3 ‘O if my father get word of this, At hame in his ain country, He'll send red gowd for my relief, And a bag o white money. 4 ‘O gin an earl woud borrow me, At his bridle I woud rin; Or gin a widow woud borrow me, I'd swear to be her son. 5 ‘Or gin a may woud borrow me, I'd wed her wi a ring, Infeft her wi the ha's and bowers O the bonny towers o Linne.’ 6 But it fell ance upon a day Dame Essels she thought lang, And she is to the jail-house door, To hear Young Bondwell's sang. 7 ‘Sing on, sing on, my bonny Bondwell, The sang ye sang just now:’ ‘I never sang the sang, lady, But I woud war 'ton you. 8 ‘O gin my father get word o this, At hame in his ain country, He'll send red gowd for my relief, And a bag o white money. 9 ‘O gin an earl woud borrow me, At his bridle I woud rin; Or gin a widow would borrow me, I'd swear to be her son. 10 ‘Or gin a may woud borrow me, I woud wed her wi a ring, Infeft her wi the ha's and bowers O the bonny towers o Linne.’ 11 She's stole the keys o the jail-house door, Where under the bed they lay; She's opend to him the jail-house door, And set Young Bondwell free. 12 She gae'm a steed was swift in need, A saddle o royal ben, A hunder pund o pennies round, Bade him gae roav an spend. 13 A couple o hounds o ae litter, And Cain they ca'd the one; Twa gay gos-hawks she gae likeways, To keep him onthought lang. 14 When mony days were past and gane, Dame Essels thought fell lang, And she is to her lonely bower, To shorten her wi a sang. 15 The sang had such a melody, It lulld her fast asleep; Up starts a woman, clad in green, And stood at her bed-feet. 16 ‘Win up, win up, Dame Essels,’ she says, ‘This day ye sleep ower lang; The morn is the squire's wedding day, In the bonny towers o Linne. 17 ‘Ye'll dress yoursell in the robes o green, Your maids in robes sae fair, And ye'll put girdles about their middles, Sae costly, rich and rare. 18 ‘Ye'll take your maries alang wi you, Till ye come to yon strand; There ye'll see a ship, wi sails all up, Come sailing to dry land. 19 ‘Ye'll take a wand into your hand, Ye'll stroke her round about, And ye'll take God your pilot to be, To drown ye'll take nae doubt.’ 20 Then up it raise her Dame Essels, Sought water to wash her hands, But aye the faster that she washd, The tears they trickling ran. 21 Then in it came her father dear, And in the floor steps he: ‘What ails Dame Essels, my daughter dear, Ye weep sae bitterlie? 22 ‘Want ye a small fish frae the flood, Or turtle frae the sea? Or is there man in a' my realm This day has offended thee?’ 23 ‘I want nae small fish frae the flood, Nor turtle frae the sea; But Young Bondwell, your ain prisoner, This day has offended me.’ 24 Her father turnd him round about, A solemn oath sware he: ‘If this be true ye tell me now High hanged he shall be. 25 ‘To-morrow morning he shall be Hung high upon a tree:’ Dame Essels whisperd to hersel, ‘Father, ye've made a lie.’ 26 She dressd hersel in robes o green, Her maids in robes sae fair, Wi gowden girdles round their middles, Sae costly, rich and rare. 27 She's taen her mantle her about, A maiden in every hand; They saw a ship, wi sails a' up, Come sailing to dry land. 28 She's taen a wand intill her hand, And stroked her round about, And she's taen God her pilot to be, To drown she took nae doubt. 29 So they saild on, and further on, Till to the water o Tay; There they spied a bonny little boy, Was watering his steeds sae gay. 30 ‘What news, what news, my little boy, What news hae ye to me? Are there any weddings in this place, Or any gaun to be?’ 31 ‘There is a wedding in this place, A wedding very soon; The morn's the young squire's wedding day, In the bonny towers of Linne.’ 32 O then she walked alang the way To see what coud be seen, And there she saw the proud porter, Drest in a mantle green. 33 ‘What news, what news, porter?’ she said, ‘What news hae ye to me? Are there any weddings in this place, Or any gaun to be?’ 34 ‘There is a wedding in this place, A wedding very soon; The morn is Young Bondwell's wedding day, The bonny squire o Linne.’ 35 ‘Gae to your master, porter,’ she said, ‘Gae ye right speedilie; Bid him come and speak wi a maid That wishes his face to see.’ 36 The porter's up to his master gane, Fell low down on his knee; ‘Win up, win up, my porter,’ he said, ‘Why bow ye low to me?’ 37 ‘I hae been porter at your yetts These thirty years and three, But fairer maids than's at them now My eyes did never see. 38 ‘The foremost she is drest in green, The rest in fine attire, Wi gowden girdles round their middles, Well worth a sheriff's hire.’ 39 Then out it speaks Bondwell's own bride, Was a' gowd to the chin; ‘They canno be fairer thereout,’ she says, ‘Than we that are therein.’ 40 ‘There is a difference, my dame,’ he said, ‘'Tween that ladye's colour and yours; As much difference as you were a stock, She o the lily flowers.’ 41 Then out it speaks him Young Bondwell, An angry man was he: ‘Cast up the yetts baith wide an braid, These ladies I may see.’ 42 Quickly up stairs Dame Essel's gane, Her maidens next her wi; Then said the bride, This lady's face Shows the porter's tauld nae lie. 43 The lady unto Bondwell spake, These words pronounced she: O hearken, hearken, fause Bondwell, These words that I tell thee. 44 Is this the way ye keep your vows That ye did make to me, When your feet were in iron fetters, Ae foot ye coudna flee? 45 I stole the keys o the jail-house door Frae under the bed they lay, And opend up the jail-house door, Set you at liberty. 46 Gae you a steed was swift in need, A saddle o royal ben, A hunder pund o pennies round, Bade you gae rove an spend. 47 A couple o hounds o ae litter, Cain they ca'ed the ane, Twa gay gos-hawks as swift's eer flew, To keep you onthought lang. 48 But since this day ye've broke your vow, For which ye're sair to blame, And since nae mair I'll get o you, O Cain, will ye gae hame? 49 ‘O Cain!

Randall. 1 In London was Young Bichen born, He longd strange lands to see; He set his foot on good ship-board, And he sailed over the sea. 2 He had not been in a foreign land A day but only three, Till he was taken by a savage Moor, And they used him most cruelly. 3 In every shoulder they put a pin, To every pin they put a tree; They made him draw the plow and cart, Like horse and oxen in his country. 4 He had not servd the savage Moor A week, nay scarcely but only three, Till he has casten him in prison strong, Till he with hunger was like to die. 5 It fell out once upon a day That Young Bichen he made his moan, As he lay bound in irons strong, In a dark and deep dungeon. 6 ‘An I were again in fair England, As many merry day I have been, Then I would curb my roving youth No more to see a strange land. 7 ‘O an I were free again now, And my feet well set on the sea, I would live in peace in my own country, And a foreign land I no more would see.’ 8 The savage Moor had but one daughter, I wot her name was Susan Py; She heard Young Bichen make his moan, At the prison-door as she past by. 9 ‘O have ye any lands,’ she said, ‘Or have you any money free, Or have you any revenues, To maintain a lady like me?’ 10 ‘O I have land in fair England, And I have estates two or three, And likewise I have revenues, To maintain a lady like thee.’ 11 ‘O will you promise, Young Bichen,’ she says, ‘And keep your vow faithful to me, That at the end of seven years In fair England you'll marry me? 12 ‘I'll steal the keys from my father dear, Tho he keeps them most secretly; I'll risk my life for to save thine, And set thee safe upon the sea.’ 13 She's stolen the keys from her father, From under the bed where they lay; She opened the prison strong And set Young Bichen at liberty. 14 She's gone to her father's coffer, Where the gold was red and fair to see; She filled his pockets with good red gold, And she set him far upon the sea. 15 ‘O mind you well, Young Bichen,’ she says, ‘The vows and oaths you made to me; When you are come to your native land, O then remember Susan Py!’ 16 But when her father he came home He missd the keys there where they lay; He went into the prison strong, But he saw Young Bichen was away. 17 ‘Go bring your daughter, madam,’ he says, ‘And bring her here unto me; Altho I have no more but her, Tomorrow I'll gar hang her high.’ 18 The lady calld on the maiden fair To come to her most speedily; ‘Go up the country, my child,’ she says, ‘Stay with my brother two years or three. 19 ‘I have a brother, he lives in the isles, He will keep thee most courteously And stay with him, my child,’ she says, ‘Till thy father's wrath be turnd from thee.’ 20 Now will we leave young Susan Py A while in her own country, And will return to Young Bichen, Who is safe arrived in fair England. 21 He had not been in fair England Above years scarcely three, Till he has courted another maid, And so forgot his Susan Py. 22 The youth being young and in his prime, Of Susan Py thought not upon, But his love was laid on another maid, And the marriage-day it did draw on. 23 But eer the seven years were run, Susan Py she thought full long; She set her foot on good ship-board, And she has saild for fair England. 24 On every finger she put a ring, On her mid-finger she put three; She filld her pockets with good red gold, And she has sailed oer the sea. 25 She had not been in fair England A day, a day, but only three, Till she heard Young Bichen was a bridegroom, And the morrow to be the wedding-day. 26 ‘Since it is so,’ said young Susan, ‘That he has provd so false to me, I'll hie me to Young Bichen's gates, And see if he minds Susan Py.’ 27 She has gone up thro London town, Where many a lady she there did spy; There was not a lady in all London Young Susan that could outvie. 28 She has calld upon a waiting-man, A waiting-man who stood near by: ‘Convey me to Young Bichen's gates, And well rewarded shals thou be.’ 29 When she came to Young Bichen's gate She chapped loudly at the pin, Till down there came the proud porter; ‘Who's there,’ he says, ‘that would be in?’ 30 ‘Open the gates, porter,’ she says, ‘Open them to a lady gay, And tell your master, porter,’ she says, ‘To speak a word or two with me.’ 31 The porter he has opend the gates; His eyes were dazzled to see A lady dressd in gold and jewels; No page nor waiting-man had she. 32 ‘O pardon me, madam,’ he cried, ‘This day it is his wedding-day; He's up the stairs with his lovely bride, And a sight of him you cannot see.’ 33 She put her hand in her pocket, And therefrom took out guineas three, And gave to him, saying, Please, kind sir, Bring down your master straight to me. 34 The porter up again has gone, And he fell low down on his knee, Saying, Master, you will please come down To a lady who wants you to see. 35 A lady gay stands at your gates, The like of her I neer did see; She has more gold above her eye Nor would buy a baron's land to me. 36 Out then spake the bride's mother, I'm sure an angry woman was she: ‘You're impudent and insolent, For ye might excepted the bride and me.’ 37 ‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye proud woman, I'm sure sae loud as I hear you lie; She has more gold on her body Than would buy the lands, the bride, and thee!’ 38 ‘Go down, go down, porter,’ he says, ‘And tell the lady gay from me That I'm up-stairs wi my lovely bride, And a sight of her I cannot see.’ 39 The porter he goes down again, The lady waited patiently: ‘My master's with his lovely bride, And he'll not win down my dame to see.’ 40 From off her finger she's taen a ring; ‘Give that your master,’ she says, ‘from me, And tell him now, young man,’ she says, ‘To send down a cup of wine to me.’ 41 ‘Here's a ring for you, master,’ he says, ‘On her mid-finger she has three, And you are desird, my lord,’ he says, ‘To send down a cup of wine with me.’ 42 He hit the table with his foot, He kepd it with his right knee: ‘I'll wed my life and all my land That is Susan Py, come o'er the sea!’ 43 He has gone unto the stair-head, A step he took but barely three; He opend the gates most speedily, And Susan Py he there could see. 44 ‘Is this the way, Young Bichen,’ she says, ‘Is this the way you've guided me? I relieved you from prison strong, And ill have you rewarded me. 45 ‘O mind ye, Young Bichen,’ she says, ‘The vows and oaths that ye made to me, When ye lay bound in prison strong, In a deep dungeon of misery?’ 46 He took her by the milk-white hand, And led her into the palace fine; There was not a lady in all the palace But Susan Py did all outshine. 47 The day concluded with joy and mirth, On every side there might you see; There was great joy in all England For the wedding-day of Susan Py.</field>

Harris Cowper's Apocryphal Gospels, p. xli. 1 As I passd by a river side, And there as I did reign, In argument I chanced to hear A Carnal and a Crane. 2 The Carnal said unto the Crane, If all the world should turn, Before we had the Father, But now we have the Son! 3 ‘From whence does the Son come, From where and from what place?’ He said, In a manger, Between an ox and ass. 4 ‘I pray thee,’ said the Carnal, ‘Tell me before thou go, Was not the mother of Jesus Conceivd by the Holy Ghost?’ 5 She was the purest virgin, And the cleanest from sin; She was the handmaid of our Lord And mother of our king. 6 ‘Where is the golden cradle That Christ was rocked in? Where are the silken sheets That Jesus was wrapt in?’ 7 A manger was the cradle That Christ was rocked in: The provender the asses left So sweetly he slept on. 8 There was a star in the east land, So bright it did appear, Into King Herod's chamber, And where King Herod were. 9 The Wise Men soon espied it, And told the king on high A princely babe was born that night No king could eer destroy. 10 ‘If this be true,’ King Herod said, ‘As thou tellest unto me, This roasted cock that lies in the dish Shall crow full fences three.’ 11 The cock soon freshly featherd was, By the work of God's own hand, And then three fences crowed he, In the dish where he did stand. 12 ‘Rise up, rise up, you merry men all, See that you ready be; All children under two years old Now slain they all shall be.’ 13 Then Jesus, ah, and Joseph, And Mary, that was so pure, They travelld into Egypt, As you shall find it sure. 14 And when they came to Egypt's land, Amongst those fierce wild beasts, Mary, she being weary, Must needs sit down to rest. 15 ‘Come sit thee down,’ says Jesus, ‘Come sit thee down by me, And thou shalt see how these wild beasts Do come and worship me.’ 16 First came the lovely lion, Which Jesus's grace did bring, And of the wild beasts in the field The lion shall be king. 17 We'll choose our virtuous princes Of birth and high degree, In every sundry nation, Whereer we come and see. 18 Then Jesus, ah, and Joseph, And Mary, that was unknown, They travelled by a husbandman, Just while his seed was sown. 19 ‘God speed thee, man,’ said Jesus, ‘Go fetch thy ox and wain, And carry home thy corn again Which thou this day hast sown.’ 20 The husbandman fell on his knees, Even upon his face: ‘Long time hast thou been looked for, But now thou art come at last. 21 ‘And I myself do now believe Thy name is Jesus called; Redeemer of mankind thou art, Though undeserving all.’ 22 ‘The truth, man, thou hast spoken, Of it thou mayst be sure, For I must lose my precious blood For thee and thousands more. 23 ‘If any one should come this way, And enquire for me alone, Tell them that Jesus passed by As thou thy seed did sow.’ 24 After that there came King Herod, With his train so furiously, Enquiring of the husbandman Whether Jesus passed by. 25 ‘Why, the truth it must be spoke, And the truth it must be known; For Jesus passed by this way When my seed was sown. 26 ‘But now I have it reapen, And some laid on my wain, Ready to fetch and carry Into my barn again.’ 27 ‘Turn back,’ says the captain, ‘Your labor and mine's in vain; It's full three quarters of a year Since he his seed has sown.’ 28 So Herod was deceived, By the work of God's own hand, And further he proceeded Into the Holy Land. 29 There's thousands of children young Which for his sake did die; Do not forbid those little ones, And do not them deny. 30 The truth now I have spoken And the truth now I have shown; Even the Blessed Virgin She's now brought forth a son. 56 DIVES AND LAZARUS Dives and Lazarus DIVES AND LAZARUS—A a.

Oh that I had my peace secure!

Or wha'll gae up to my topmast, And look for some dry land? 12 ‘Mount up, mount up, my pretty boy, See what you can spy; Mount up, mount up, my pretty boy, See if any land we're nigh.’ 13 ‘We're fifty miles from shore to shore, And fifty banks of sand; And we have all that for to sail Or we come to dry land.’ 14 ‘Come down, come down, my pretty boy, I think you tarry lang; For the saut sea's in at our coat-neck And out at our left arm. 15 ‘Come down, come down, my pretty boy, I fear we here maun die; For thro and thro my goodly ship I see the green-waved sea.’ 16 Our Scotch lords were all afraid To weet their cork-heeled shoon; But lang or a' the play was played, Their hats they swam abune. 17 The first step that the captain stept, It took him to the knee, And the next step that the captain stepped They were a' drownd in the sea. 18 Half owre, half owre to Aberdour It's fifty fadoms deep, And there lay good Sir Patrick Spens, And the Scotch lords at his feet. 19 Lang may our Scotch lords' ladies sit, And sew their silken seam, Before they see their good Scotch lords Come sailing owre the main. 20 Lang lang may Sir Patrick's lady Sit rocking her auld son, Before she sees Sir Patrick Spens Come sailing owre the main. Sir Andro Wood SIR PATRICK SPENS—D Motherwell's MS., p. 496, communicated by Kirkpatrick Sharpe. 1 The king sits in Dumferling town, Drinking the blood red wine: O ‘Where will I get a good skipper, To sail seven ships o mine?’ O Where will, etc. 2 O up then spake a bra young man, And a bra young man was he: ‘Sir Andrew Wood is the best skipper That ever saild the sea.’ 3 The king has written a bra letter, And seald it wi his hand, And ordered Sir Andrew Wood To come at his command. 4 ‘O wha is this, or wha is that, Has tauld the king o me? For had he been a better man, He might ha tauld a lee.’ 5 As I came in by the Inch, Inch, Inch, I heard an auld man weep: ‘Sir Andrew Wood and a' his men Are drowned in the deep!’ 6 O lang lang may yon ladies stand, Their fans into their hands, Before they see Sir Andrew Wood Come sailing to dry land. 7 O laith laith were our Scottish lords To weit their cork-heeld shoon; But ere that a' the play was plaid, They wat their heads aboon. 8 Nore-east, nore-west frae Aberdeen Is fifty fathom deep, And there lies good Sir Andrew Wood, And a' the Scottish fleet. Young Patrick SIR PATRICK SPENS—E Motherwell's MS., p. 348. 1 The king sits in Dumfermline toun, Sae merrilie drinking wine; O Says, Whare will I get a fine skipper, Wud sail these ships of mine? O 2 Out and spak an auld rich knicht, And an ill death may he die! Says, Young Patrick is the best skipper That ever set sail on sea. 3 The king did write a lang letter, Sealed it with his own hand, And he sent it to Young Patrick, To come at his command. 4 When Young Patrick read the letter lang, The tear blindit his ee; Says Wha is this, or wha is that, That's tauld the king of me? Altho he had been better than what he is, He micht hae askt leave of me. 5 ‘But busk, O busk, my merry men a’, O busk and mak you braw, For blaw the wind what airt it will, Our ship she must awa. 6 ‘Drink, O drink, my merrie men all, Drink o the beer and wine, For gin Wedensday by twal o'clock We'll a' be in our lang hame.’ 7 Out and spak a pretty little boy: ‘I fear a deadlie storm; For I saw the new mune late yestreen, And the old ane in her arm, And readilie, maister,’ said he, ‘That's the sign of a deadly storm.’ 8 Aye they sat, and aye they drank, They drank of the beer and wine, And gin Wedensday gin ten o'clock, Their hair was wat abune. 9 ‘Whare wuld I get a pretty little boy, That wants to win hose and shoon, Wuld up to the top of my mainmast go, See if he could spy land?’ 10 ‘O here am I, a pretty little boy, Wants to win hose and shoon; I'll up to the top of your mainmast go, Though I should neer come doun.’ 11 ‘Come doun, come doun, my pretty little boy, I think thou tarries lang; For the jawe is coming in at my coat-neck, Going out at my richt hand.’ 12 But there cum a shouir out o the Norewest, Of dreidfu hail and rain, It made Young Patrick and his men A' flat wi the sea faem. 13 O is na it a great pitye To see feather-beds on the main? But it is a greater pitye, I think, To see men doing the same. 14 There's a brig at the back o Sanct John's toun, It's fifty fadom deep, And there lies a' our brau Scots lords, Young Patrick's at their feet. 15 Young Patrick's lady sits at hame, She's sewing her silken seam; And aye when she looks to the salt sea waves, ‘I fear he'll neer return.’ 16 Young Patrick's lady sits at hame Rocking her oldest son; And aye when she looks to the salt sea waves, ‘I'm feared he'll neer come hame.’ Skipper Patrick SIR PATRICK SPENS—F Motherwell's MS., p. 153, from the recitation of Mrs Thomson. 1 The king he sits on Dunfermline hill, Drinking baith beer and wine; O Says, Whare shall I get a good skipper, That will sail the salt sea fine? O 2 But out then speaks an Irish knight, Sat by the king's right knee: ‘Skipper Patrick is the best skipper That ever my eyes did see.’ 3 The king has written a lang letter, And sealed it wi his hand, And sent it to Skipper Patrick, As he walked alang the sand. 4 ‘O wha is this, or wha is that, That's tauld the king of me? For tho it had been the queen hersell, She might hae let it be. 5 ‘But busk you, O busk, my merry men all, Sae merrily busk and boune, For blaw the wind where eer it will, Our gude ship sails the morn.’ 6 ‘O no, O no, our dear master, It will be a deidly storm; For yestreen I saw the new new mune, Wi the auld mune in her arm; It's a token, maister, or ye were born, It will be a deadly storm.’ 7 ‘But busk, O busk, my merrie men all, Our gude ship sails the morn, For blow the wind whereer it will, Our gude ship sails the morn.’ 8 They had na sailed a day, a day, A day but scarsely five, Till Skipper Patrick's bonny ship Began to crack and rive. 9 It's bonny was the feather beds That swimmed alang the main, But bonnier was our braw Scots lords, They neer returned again. 10 Our Scots lords they are all laith To weet their coal black shoon; But I trow or a' the play was played, They wat their hair abune. 11 Our ladies may stand upon the sand, Kembing down their yellow hair, But they will neer see Skipper Patrick's ship Come sailing in nae mair. 12 Our ladies may stand upon the sand Wi gloves upon their hand, But they will never see Skipper Patrick's ship Come sailing into the land. 13 O vour and o vour to bonnie Aberdour It's fifty fadoms deep; There you will find young Patrick lye, Wi his Scots lords at his head. 14 Row owre, row owre to Aberdour, It's fifty fadom deep; And there lies Earl Patrick Spens, His men all at his feet. Sir Patrick Spence SIR PATRICK SPENS—G Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 157, communicated by Scott. 1 The king sits in Dunfermlin town, Sae merrily drinkin the wine: ‘Whare will I get a mariner, Will sail this ship o mine?’ 2 Then up bespak a bonny boy, Sat just at the king's knee: ‘Sir Patrick Spence is the best seaman, That eer set foot on sea.’ 3 The king has written a braid letter, Seald it wi his ain hand; He has sent word to Sir Patrick, To come at his command. 4 ‘O wha is this, or wha is that, Has tald the king o me? For I was never a good seaman, Nor ever intend to be.’ 5 They mounted sail on Munenday morn, Wi a' the haste they may, And they hae landed in Norraway, Upon the Wednesday. 6 They hadna been a month, a month In Norraway but three, Till lads o Norraway began to say, Ye spend a' our white monie. 7 ‘Ye spend a' our good kingis goud, But and our queenis fee:’ ‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye liars loud, Sae weel's I hear you lie. 8 ‘For I brought as much white money As will gain my men and me; I brought half a fou o good red goud Out oer the sea with me. 9 ‘Be't wind or weet, be't snaw or sleet, Our ships maun sail the morn:’ ‘O ever alack! my master dear, I fear a deadly storm. 10 ‘I saw the new moon late yestreen, Wi the auld moon in her arm; And if we gang to sea, master, I fear we'll suffer harm.’ 11 They hadna sailed a league on sea, A league but barely ane, Till anchors brak, and tap-masts lap; There came a deadly storm. 12 ‘Whare will I get a bonny boy Will tak thir sails in hand, That will gang up to the tap-mast, See an he ken dry land?’ 13 Laith, laith were our good Scots lords To weet their leathern shoon; But or the morn at fair day-light, Their hats were wat aboon. 14 Mony was the feather bed, That flotterd on the faem, And mony was the good Scots lord Gaed awa that neer cam hame, And mony was the fatherless bairn That lay at hame greetin. 15 It's forty miles to Aberdeen, And fifty fathoms deep; And there lyes a' our good Scots lords, Wi Sir Patrick at their feet. 16 The ladies crackt their fingers white, The maidens tore their hair, A' for the sake o their true loves, For them they neer saw mair. 17 Lang, lang may our ladies stand, Wi their fans in their hand, Ere they see Sir Patrick and his men Come sailing to the land.

Goe with me,’ saide our comly king, ‘This lazar for to see.’ 12 When the king he came into the queenes chamber, Standing her bed befor, ‘There is a lodly lome,’ says Harry King, ‘For our dame Queene Elinor! 13 ‘If thou were a man, as thou art none, Here thou sholdest be slaine; But a paire of new gallowes shall be built, Thoust hang on them soe hye. 14 ‘And [a] fayre fyer there shalbe bett, And brent our queene shalbee:’ Fforth then walked our comlye king, And mett with our comly queene. 15 Saies, God you saue, our queene, Madam, And Christ you saue and see! Heere you [haue] chosen a new, new loue, And you will haue none of mee. 16 ‘If you had chosen a right good knight, The lesse had beene your shame; But you haue chosen a lazar man, That is both blind and lame.’ 17 ‘Euer alacke!’ said our comly queene, ‘Sir Aldingar is false to mee; But euer alacke!’ said our comly queene, ‘Euer alas, and woe is mee! 18 ‘I had thought sweuens had neuer been true; I haue prooued them true at the last; I dreamed in my sweauen on Thursday at eueninge, In my bed wheras I lay, 19 ‘I dreamed a grype and a grimlie beast Had carryed my crowne away, My gorgett and my kirtle of golde, And all my faire heade-geere. 20 ‘How he wold haue worryed me with his tush, And borne me into his nest, Saving there came a little hawk, Flying out of the east. 21 ‘Saving there came a little hawke, Which men call a merlion; Vntill the ground he stroke him downe, That dead he did fall downe. 22 ‘Giffe I were a man, as I am none, A battell I would proue; I wold fight with that false traitor; Att him I cast my gloue! 23 ‘Seing I am able noe battell to make, You must grant me, my leege, a knight, To fight with that traitor, Sir Aldingar, To maintaine me in my right.’ 24 ‘I'le giue thee forty dayes,’ said our king, ‘To seeke thee a man therin; If thou find not a man in forty dayes, In a hott fyer thou shall brenn.’ 25 Our queene sent forth a messenger; He rode fast into the south; He rode the countryes through and through, Soe ffar vnto Portsmouth. 26 He cold find never a man in the south country That wold fight with the knight soe keene. 27 The second messenger the queen forth sent Rode far into the east; But, blessed be God made sunn and moone! He sped then all of the best. 28 As he rode then by one riuer side, There he mett with a little child; He seemed noe more in a mans likenesse Then a child of four yeeres old. 29 He askt the queenes messenger how far he rode; Loth he was him to tell; The little one was offended att him, Bid him adew, farwell. 30 Said, Turne thou againe, thou messenger, Greete our queene well from me; When bale is att hyest, boote is att next; Helpe enough there may bee. 31 ‘Bid our queene remember what she did dreame In her bedd wheras shee lay; Shee dreamed the grype and the grimly beast Had carryed her crowne away; 32 ‘Her gorgett and her kirtle of gold, Alsoe her faire head-geere; He wold haue werryed her with his tushe, And borne her into his nest. 33 ‘Saving there came a little hawke, Men call him a merlyon; Vntill the ground he did strike him downe, That dead he did ffall downe. 34 ‘Bidd the queene be merry att her hart, Euermore light and glad; When bale is att hyest, boote is at next, Helpe enoughe there shalbe.’ 35 Then the queenes messenger rode backe, A gladed man then was hee; When he came before our queene, A gladd woman then was shee. 36 Shee gaue the messenger twenty pound, O lord, in gold and ffee; Saies, Spend and spare not while this doth last, Then feitch thou more of me. 37 Our queene was put in a tunne to burne, She thought no thing but death; Thé were ware of the little one Came ryding forth of the east. 38 With a mu A louelie child was hee; When he came to that fier, He light the queene full nigh. 39 Said, Draw away these brands of fire Lie burning before our queene, And feitch me hither Sir Aldingar, That is a knight soe keene. 40 When Aldingar see that little one, Ffull litle of him hee thought; If there had beene halfe a hundred such, Of them he wold not haue wrought. 41 Hee sayd, Come hither, Sir Aldingar; Thou seemust as bigge as a ffooder; I trust to God, ere I haue done with thee, God will send to vs [an] auger. 42 Saies, The first stroke that's giuen, Sir Aldingar, I will giue vnto thee, And if the second giue thou may, Looke then thou spare not mee. 43 The litle one pulld forth a well good sword, I-wis itt was all of guilt; It cast light there over that feild, It shone soe all of guilt. 44 He stroke the first stroke att Aldingar, He stroke away his leggs by his knee; 45 Sayes, Stand vp, stand vp, thou false traitor, And fight vpon thy feete; For and thou thriue as thou begins, Of a height wee shalbe meete. 46 ‘A preist, a preist,’ sayes Aldingar, ‘Me for to houzle and shriue! A preist, a preist,’ sayes Aldingar, ‘While I am a man liuing a-liue! 47 ‘I wold haue laine by our comlie queene; To it shee wold neuer consent; I thought to haue betrayd her to our king, In a fyer to haue had her brent. 48 ‘There came a lame lazar to the kings gates, A lazar both blind and lame; I tooke the lazar vpon my backe, In the Queenes bed I did him lay. 49 ‘I bad him, Lie still, lazar, where he lay, Looke he went not away; I wold make him a whole man and a sound In two houres of a day. 50 ‘Euer alacke!’ sayes Sir Aldingar, ‘Falsing neuer doth well; 51 ‘Forgiue, forgiue me, queene, Madam! For Christs loue forgiue me!’ ‘God forgaue his death, Aldingar, And freely I forgiue thee.’ 52 ‘Now take thy wife, thou King Harry, And loue her as thou shold; Thy wiffe shee is as true to thee As stone that lies on the castle wall.’ 53 The lazar vnder the gallow tree Was a pretty man and small; The lazar vnder the gallow tree Was made steward in King Henerys hall. Sir Hugh le Blond SIR ALDINGAR—B Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 51, 1803. Communicated to Scott by K. Williamson Burnet, of Monboddo, as written down from the recitation of an old woman, long in the service of the Arbuthnot family. 1 The birds sang sweet as ony bell, The world had not their make; The queen she's gone to her chamber, With Rodingham to talk. 2 ‘I love you well, my queen, my dame, Bove land and rents so clear, And for the love of you, my queen, Would thole pain most severe.’ 3 ‘If well you love me, Rodingham, I'm sure so do I thee; I love you well as any man, Save the king's fair bodye.’ 4 ‘I love you well, my queen, my dame, 'Tis truth that I do tell; And for to lye a night with you, The salt seas I would sail.’ 5 ‘Away, away, O Rodingham! You are both stark and stoor; Would you defile the king's own bed, And make his queen a whore? 6 ‘To-morrow you'd be taken sure, And like a traitor slain, And I'd be burned at a stake, Altho I be the queen.’ 7 He then steppd out at her room-door, All in an angry mood, Untill he met a leper-man, Just by the hard way-side. 8 He intoxicate the leper-man, With liquors very sweet, And gave him more and more to drink, Until he fell asleep. 9 He took him in his arms two, And carried him along, Till he came to the queen's own bed, And there he laid him down. 10 He then steppd out of the queen's bower, As swift as any roe, Till he came to the very place Where the king himself did go. 11 The king said unto Rodingham, What news have you to me? He said, Your queen's a false woman, As I did plainly see. 12 He hastend to the queen's chamber, So costly and so fine, Until he came to the queen's own bed, Where the leper-man was lain. 13 He looked on the leper-man, Who lay on his queen's bed; He lifted up the snaw-white sheets, And thus he to him said. 14 ‘Plooky, plooky are your cheeks, And plooky is your chin, And plooky are your armis twa, My bonny queen's layne in. 15 ‘Since she has lain into your arms, She shall not lye in mine; Since she has kissd your ugsome mouth, She never shall kiss mine.’ 16 In anger he went to the queen, Who fell upon her knee; He said, You false, unchaste woman, What's this you've done to me? 17 The queen then turnd herself about, The tear blinded her ee: ‘There's not a knight in a' your court Dare give that name to me.’ 18 He said, 'Tis true that I do say; For I a proof did make; You shall be taken from my bower, And burned at a stake. 19 ‘Perhaps I'll take my word again, And may repent the same, If that you'll get a Christian man To fight that Rodingham.’ 20 ‘Alass! alass!’ then cried our queen, ‘Alas, and woe to me! There's not a man in all Scotland Will fight with him for me.’ 21 She breathed unto her messengers, Sent them south, east, and west; They could find none to fight with him, Nor enter the contest. 22 She breathed on her messengers, She sent them to the north; And there they found Sir Hugh le Blond, To fight him he came forth. 23 When unto him they did unfold The circumstance all right, He bade them go and tell the queen That for her he would fight. 24 The day came on that was to do That dreadful tragedy; Sir Hugh le Blond was not come up, To fight for our lady. 25 ‘Put on the fire,’ the monster said, ‘It is twelve on the bell;’ ‘'Tis scarcely ten, now,’ said the king, ‘I heard the clock mysell.’ 26 Before the hour the queen is brought, The burning to proceed; In a black velvet chair she's set, A token for the dead. 27 She saw the flames ascending high, The tears blinded her ee: ‘Where is the worthy knight,’ she said, ‘Who is to fight for me?’ 28 Then up and spak the king himsell: ‘My dearest, have no doubt, For yonder comes the man himsel, As bold as eer set out.’ 29 They then advanced to fight the duel, With swords of temperd steel; Till down the blood of Rodingham Came running to his heel. 30 Sir Hugh took out a lusty sword, 'Twas of the metal clear, And he has pierced Rodingham Till's heart-blood did appear. 31 ‘Confess your treachery, now,’ he said, ‘This day before you die;’ ‘I do confess my treachery, I shall no longer lye. 32 ‘I like to wicked Haman am, This day I shall be slain:’ The queen was brought to her chamber, A good woman again. 33 The queen then said unto the king, Arbattle's near the sea; Give it unto the northern knight, That this day fought for me. 34 Then said the king, Come here, Sir Knight, And drink a glass of wine, And, if Arbattle's not enough, To it we'll Fordoun join.

Percy's Reliques, edition of 1794, I, 64. b. Reliques, edition of 1765, I, 58. 1 Hearken to me, gentlemen, Come and you shall heare; Ile tell you of two of the boldest brether That ever borne were. 2 The tone of them was Adler Younge, The tother was Kyng Estmere; The were as bolde men in their deeds As any were, farr and neare. 3 As they were drinking ale and wine Within his brother's hall, ‘When will ye marry a wyfe, brother, A wyfe to glad us all?’ 4 Then bespake him Kyng Estmere, And answered him hartilye: ‘I know not that ladye in any land, That's able to marrye with mee.’ 5 ‘Kyng Adland hath a daughter, brother, Men call her bright and sheene; If I were kyng here in your stead, That ladye shold be my queene.’ 6 Saies, Reade me, reade me, deare brother, Throughout merry England, Where we might find a messenger Betwixt us towe to sende. 7 Saies, You shal ryde yourselfe, brother, Ile beare you companye; Many a man throughe fals messengers is deceived, And I feare lest soe shold wee. 8 Thus the renisht them to ryde, Of twoe good renisht steeds, And when the came to King Adlands halle, Of redd gold shone their weeds. 9 And when the came to Kyng Adlands hall, Before the goodlye gate, There they found good Kyng Adland Rearing himselfe theratt. 10 ‘Now Christ thee save, good Kyng Adland; Now Christ you save and see:’ Sayd, You be welcome, King Estmere, Right hartilye to mee. 11 ‘You have a daughter,’ said Adler Younge, ‘Men call her bright and sheene; My brother wold marrye her to his wiffe, Of Englande to be queene.’ 12 ‘Yesterday was att my deere daughter The king his sonne of Spayn, And then she nicked him of naye, And I doubt sheele do you the same.’ 13 ‘The kyng of Spayne is a foule paynim, And 'leeveth on Mahound, And pitye it were that fayre ladye Shold marrye a heathen hound.’ 14 ‘But grant to me,’ sayes Kyng Estmere, ‘For my love I you praye, That I may see your daughter deere Before I goe hence awaye.’ 15 ‘Although itt is seven yeers and more Since my daughter was in halle, She shall come once downe for your sake, To glad my guestës alle.’ 16 Downe then came that mayden fayre, With ladyes laced in pall, And halfe a hundred of bold knightes, To bring her [from] bowre to hall, And as many gentle squiers, To tend upon them all. 17 The talents of golde were on her head sette Hanged low downe to her knee, And everye ring on her small finger Shone of the chrystall free. 18 Saies, God you save, my deere madam, Saies, God you save and see: Said, You be welcome, Kyng Estmere, Right welcome unto mee. 19 ‘And, if you love me, as you saye, Soe well and hartilee, All that ever you are comen about Soone sped now itt shal bee.’ 20 Then bespake her father deare: My daughter, I saye naye; Remember well the kyng of Spayne, What he sayd yesterdaye. 21 ‘He wold pull downe my halles and castles, And reave me of my lyfe; I cannot blame him if he doe, If I reave him of his wyfe.’ 22 ‘Your castles and your towres, father, Are stronglye built aboute, And therefore of the king his sonne of Spaine Wee neede not stande in doubt. 23 ‘Plight me your troth, nowe, Kyng Estmere, By heaven and your righte hand, That you will marrye me to your wyfe, And make me queene of your land.’ 24 Then Kyng Estmere he plight his troth, By heaven and his righte hand, That he wolde marrye her to his wyfe, And make her queene of his land. 25 And he tooke leave of that ladye fayre, To goe to his owne countree, To fetche him dukes and lordes and knightes, That marryed the might bee. 26 They had not ridden scant a myle, A myle forthe of the towne, But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With kempës many one. 27 But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With manye a bold barone, Tone day to marrye Kyng Adlands daughter, Tother daye to carrye her home. 28 Shee sent one after Kyng Estmere, In all the spede might bee, That he must either turne againe and fighte, Or goe home and loose his ladye. 29 One whyle then the page he went, Another while he ranne; Till he had oretaken King Estmere, I-wis he never blanne. 30 ‘Tydings, tydings, Kyng Estmere!’ ‘What tydinges nowe, my boye?’ ‘O tydinges I can tell to you, That will you sore annoye. 31 ‘You had not ridden scant a mile, A mile out of the towne, But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With kempës many a one. 32 ‘But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With manye a bold barone, Tone daye to marrye King Adlands daughter, Tother daye to carry her home. 33 ‘My ladye fayre she greetes you well, And ever-more well by mee; You must either turne againe and fighte, Or goe home and loose your ladye.’ 34 Saies, Reade me, reade me, deere brother, My reade shall ryse at thee, Whether it is better to turne and fighte, Or goe home and loose my ladye. 35 ‘Now hearken to me,’ sayes Adler Yonge, ‘And your reade must rise at me; I quicklye will devise a waye To sette thy ladye free. 36 ‘My mother was a westerne woman, And learned in gramarye, And when I learned at the schole, Something shee taught itt mee. 37 ‘There growes an hearbe within this field, And iff it were but knowne, His color, which is whyte and redd, It will make blacke and browne. 38 ‘His color, which is browne and blacke, Itt will make redd and whyte; That sworde is not in all Englande Upon his coate will byte. 39 ‘And you shal be a harper, brother, Out of the north countrye, And Ile be your boy, soe faine of fighte, And beare your barpe by your knee. 40 ‘And you shal be the best harper That ever tooke harpe in hand, And I wil be the best singer That ever sung in this lande. 41 ‘Itt shal be written in our forheads, All and in grammarye, That we towe are the boldest men That are in all Christentye.’ 42 And thus they renisht them to ryde, Of tow good renisht steedes, And when they came to King Adlands hall, Of redd gold shone their weedes. 43 And whan the came to Kyng Adlands hall Untill the fayre hall-yate, There they found a proud porter, Rearing himselfe thereatt. 44 Sayes, Christ thee save, thou proud porter, Sayes, Christ thee save and see: ‘Nowe you be welcome,’ sayd the porter, ‘Of what land soever ye bee.’ 45 ‘Wee beene harpers,’ sayd Adler Younge, ‘Come out of the northe countrye; Wee beene come hither untill this place This proud weddinge for to see.’ 46 Sayd, And your color were white and redd, As it is blacke and browne, I wold saye King Estmere and his brother Were comen untill this towne. 47 Then they pulled out a ryng of gold, Layd itt on the porters arme: ‘And ever we will thee, proud porter, Thow wilt saye us no harme.’ 48 Sore he looked on Kyng Estmere, And sore he handled the ryng, Then opened to them the fayre hall-yates, He lett for no kind of thyng. 49 Kyng Estmere he stabled his steede Soe fayre att the hall-bord; The froth that came from his brydle bitte Light in Kyng Bremors beard. 50 Saies, Stable thy steed, thou proud harper, Saies, Stable him in the stalle; It doth not beseeme a proud harper To stable his steed in a kyngs halle. 51 ‘My ladde he is so lither,’ he said, ‘He will doe nought that's meete; And is there any man in this hall Were able him to beate?’ 52 ‘Thou speakst proud words,’ sayes the king of Spaine, ‘Thou harper, here to mee; There is a man within this halle Will beate thy ladd and thee.’ 53 ‘O let that man come downe,’ he said, ‘A sight of him wold I see; And when hee hath beaten well my ladd, Then he shall beate of mee.’ 54 Downe then came the kemperye man, And looked him in the eare; For all the gold that was under heaven, He durst not neigh him neare. 55 ‘And how nowe, kempe,’ said the kyng of Spaine, ‘And how, what aileth thee?’ He saies, It is writt in his forhead, All and in gramarye, That for all the gold that is under heaven, I dare not neigh him nye. 56 Then Kyng Estmere pulld forth his harpe, And plaid a pretty thinge; The ladye upstart from the borde, And wold have gone from the king. 57 ‘Stay thy harpe, thou proud harper, For Gods love I pray thee; For and thou playes as thou beginns, Thou'lt till my bryde from mee.’ 58 He stroake upon his harpe againe, And playd a pretty thinge; The ladye lough a loud laughter, As shee sate by the king. 59 Saies, Sell me thy harpe, thou proud harper, And thy stringës all; For as many gold nobles thou shalt have As heere bee ringes in the hall.’ 60 ‘What wold ye doe with my harpe,’ he savd, ‘If I did sell itt yee?’ ‘To playe my wiffe and me a fitt, When abed together wee bee.’ 61 ‘Now sell me,’ quoth hee, ‘thy bryde soe gay, As shee sitts by thy knee; And as many gold nobles I will give As leaves been on a tree.’ 62 ‘And what wold ye doe with my bryde soe gay, Iff I did sell her thee? More seemelye it is for her fayre bodye To lye by mee then thee.’ 63 Hee played agayne both loud and shrille, And Adler he did syng, ‘O ladye, this is thy owne true love, Noe harper, but a kyng. 64 ‘O ladye, this is thy owne true love, As playnlye thou mayest see, And Ile rid thee of that foule paynim Who partes thy love and thee.’ 65 The ladye looked, the ladye blushte, And blushte and lookt agayne, While Adler he hath drawne his brande, And hath the sowdan slayne. 66 Up then rose the kemperye men, And loud they gan to crye: ‘Ah! traytors, yee have slayne our kyng, And therefore yee shall dye.’ 67 Kyng Estmere threwe the harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand, And Estmere he and Adler Yonge Right stiffe in stour can stand. 68 And aye their swordes soe sore can byte, Throughe help of gramarye, That soone they have slayne the kempery men, Or forst them forth to flee. 69 Kyng Estmere tooke that fayre ladye, And marryed her to his wiffe, And brought her home to merry England, With her to leade his life. 61 SIR CAWLINE SIR CAWLINE Percy MS., p. 368; Hales and Furnivall, III, 3. 1 And in that land dwells a king Which does beare the bell ouer all, And with him there dwelled a curteous knight, Sir Cawline men him call. 2 And he hath a ladye to his daughter, Of ffashyon shee hath noe peere; Knights and lordes they woed her both, Trusted to haue beene her feere. 3 Sir Cawline loues her best of onë, But nothing durst hee say To discreeue his councell to noe man, But deerlye loued this may. 4 Till itt beffell vpon a day, Great dill to him was dight; The maydens loue remoued his mind, To care-bed went the knight. 5 And one while he spread his armes him ffroe, And cryed soe pittyouslye: ‘Ffor the maydens loue that I haue most minde This day may comfort mee, Or else ere noone I shalbe dead!’ Thus can Sir Cawline say. 6 When our parish masse that itt was done, And our king was bowne to dine, He sayes, Where is Sir Cawline, That was wont to serue me with ale and wine? 7 But then answered a curteous knight, Ffast his hands wringinge: ‘Sir Cawline's sicke, and like to be dead Without and a good leedginge.’ 8 ‘Ffeitch yee downe my daughter deere, Shee is a leeche ffull ffine; I, and take you doe and the baken bread, And drinke he on the wine soe red, And looke no daynti is ffor him to deare, For ffull loth I wold him tine.’ 9 This ladye is gone to his chamber, Her maydens ffollowing nye; ‘O well,’ shee sayth, ‘how doth my lord?’ ‘O sicke!’ againe saith hee. 10 ‘I, but rise vp wightlye, man, for shame!

Or wha welcome my brisk bride, That I'll bring oure the dale?’ 4 ‘O I will bake your bridal bread, And brew your bridal ale; But I downa welcam your brisk bride That ye'll bring frae the dale.’ 5 ‘She that welcomes my brisk bride, She maun look maiden-like; She maun kaim doun her yellow locks, And lay them in her neck.’ 6 ‘O how can I look maiden-like, Whan maiden I am nane? For seven sons I hae born to thee, And the eighth lies in my wame. 7 ‘But what aileth thee at me, my lord, What aileth thee at me, Whan seven braw sons I've born to thee, Out of my fair bodie? 8 ‘The first ane of your sons, my lord, Can baith read and write; And the second of your sons, my lord, Can do it maist perfyte. 9 ‘The third ane o your sons, my lord, Can water your grey steed; And the fourth ane o your sons, my lord, Can bake your bridal bread. 10 ‘The fifth ane o your sons, my lord, Can serve ye whan ye dine; And the sixth ane o your sons, my lord, Can brew your bridal wine. 11 ‘The seventh ane o your sons, my lord, Lies close at my breist-bane; Whan a' the lave are fast asleep, It's rest I can get nane.’ 12 He set his foot into the stirrup, His hand upon the mane; Says, It will be year and day, ladie, Ere ye see me again. 13 Whan he had ae foot on the sea, The ither on dry lan, ‘It will be year and day, ladie, Till I come back again.’ 14 Whan year and day war past and gane, Fair Annie she thought lang; And she went up to her hie tower, Wi a silk seam in her hand. 15 She lookit east, she lookit west, And south, below the sun, And there she spied her ain gude lord, Coming sailing to the lan. 16 She called up her seven braw sons, By ane, twa, and by three: ‘See, yonder comes your father, And your mother-for-to-be.’ 17 And she called up her servants a': ‘O come, behold and see! O yonder comes your master dear, And a new mistress brings he. 18 ‘Gae doun, gae doun, my eldest son, Into the outmost ha, And if ye welcome ane o them, Be sure to welcome a'.’ 19 Some ran east, and some ran west, And some ran to the sea; There was na ane in a' his house To welcome his new ladie. 20 But Annie's to her coffer gane, Tane out a silver kaim, And she's kaimd doun her yellow hair, As she a maid had been. 21 And Annie has kaimd her lang yellow locks, And laid them in her neck; And she's awa to the saut, saut sea, To welcome his lady aff deck. 22 She durst na ca him her ain gude lord, For angering o the bride; But she did ca him master dear, And I wat he was richt glad. 23 ‘You're welcome, you're welcome, master,’ she said, ‘To your halls bot an your bouers; And sae are a’ thir merry young men That come alang with you. 24 ‘You're welcome, you're welcome, fair ladie, To your halls but an your bouers; And sae are a' thir gay ladies; For a' that's here is yours.’ 25 ‘I thank ye, I thank ye, fair maiden, I thank ye kindlie; If I be lang about this house, Rewarded ye sall be. 26 ‘I have a brither o mine ain; He's newly come from sea; I think it wad be a richt gude match To marry him and thee.’ 27 ‘I thank ye, I thank ye, fair ladie; Gie your brither to whom like ye; But there's never ane in this warld My wedding day sall see: But one word o my master dear In private wad I be.’ 28 The first dish that fair Annie set doun, She lookit baith pale and wan; The neist dish that fair Annie set doun, She was scarce able to stan. 29 ‘O is this your mistress, good lord,’ she says, ‘Although she looks modest and mild? Then we will hunt her frae our house Wi dogs and hawks sae wild.’ 30 ‘She's na my mistress, dear lady,’ he says, ‘Altho she looks modest and mild; Nor will we hunt her frae our house Wi dogs and hawks sae wild.’ 31 Whan bells war rung, and mass was sung, And a' men boun for bed, The bonnie bride and the bridegroom In bride's bed they were laid. 32 Whan dinner was past, and supper was by, And a' were boun for bed, Fair Annie and her seven sons In a puir bye-chamber war laid. 33 Fair Annie took out her virginals, And sadly did she play; 34 ‘O gin my sons were yon grey rats, That climb the castle-wa, And I mysel a bloody grey cat, I'd rise and worry them a'.’ 35 Then out and spak the bonny bride, In bride's bed whare she lay: ‘I think this is like my sister Anne, That doth sae sadly play.’ 36 ‘Lie still, lie still, my gay ladie; Lie still and sleep a wee; It's nathing but an auld servant, That waileth sae for me.’ 37 ‘O gin my seven sons were seven young hares, That rin round the castle wa, And I mysel a bluidy grewhund, I wad rise and worry them a'.’ 38 The new bride waukenit in the nicht, And blew upon her horn: ‘I think I hear my sister's voice, That was stown frae us a bairn.’ 39 ‘Sleep on, sleep on, dear lady,’ he says, ‘It's yon maiden in her dream, 40 ‘O wha was eer thy father, fair maid, Or wha was eer thy mither? Or wha was eer thy ae sister, Or wha was eer thy brither?’ 41 ‘King Henry was my father,’ she said, ‘Queen Elinore was my mither; Fair Marion was my ae sister, Earl Robert was my brither.’ 42 ‘Sin King Henry was your father, fair maid, And Queen Elinore your mither, O I am een your ae sister, And ye are just the ither. 43 ‘Come to your bed, fair Annie,’ she said, ‘Come to your bed full sune; I may weel say, I daur weel say, There is na evil dune. 44 ‘Seven ships of gold did bring me here, But ane shall tak me hame; Six I will leave to my sister Anne, To bring up her children young. 45 ‘But whan I gang to my father's ha, And tirl on the pin, The meanest in a' my father's house Will ca me a forsaken ane.’ The Fause Lord FAIR ANNIE—J Buchan's MSS, I, 66. 1 ‘Learn, O learn, Fair Annie,’ he said, ‘O learn to lie your lane; For I am going ower the sea, To woo and to bring hame 2 ‘A brighter and a fairer dame Than ever ye hae been; For I am going ower the sea, To chuse and bring her hame.’ 3 ‘What aileth thee, my ain gude lord, What aileth thee at me? For seven braw sons hae I born Unto your fair bodie. 4 ‘The eldest o your sons, my lord, Is heir o a' your land; The second o your braw young sons He rises at your right hand. 5 ‘The third o your braw young sons He serves you when you dine; The fourth o your braw sons, my lord, He brings to you the wine. 6 ‘The fifth o your braw young sons Right well can use the pen; The sixth o your braw young sons, He's travelling but and ben. 7 ‘The seventh o your braw young sons, He lies on my breast-bane, The fairest flower amo them a', That lay my sides between.’ 8 ‘But I am going ower the sea, To woo and to bring hame A lady wi some gowd and gear; Wi you I never got nane.’ 9 ‘Ye staw me awa in twall years auld, Ye sought nae gowd wi me; Ye put me to the schools o Ayr For fully years three. 10 ‘But wha'll be cook in your kitchen, And butler in your ha? And wha will govern your merry young men, When ye are far awa?’ 11 ‘O ye'll be cook in my kitchen, And butler in my ha, And ye'll wait on my merry young men, And serve them ane and a'.’ 12 ‘But wha will bake your bridal bread, And wha will brew your ale? And wha will welcome that lady That ye bring ower the dale? 13 ‘O ye will bake my bridal bread, And ye will brew my ale, And ye will welcome that lady That I bring ower the dale. 14 ‘Ye'll bake bread, and ye'll brew ale, For three score knights and ten; That day month I gang awa, The same day I'll come again.’ 15 ‘O I will bake your bridal bread, And I will brew your ale; But oh, to welcome another woman My heart will nae be hale.’ 16 ‘Ye will put roses in your hair, And ribbons in your sheen, And ye will look fair maiden like, Though maiden ye be nane.’ 17 ‘O I'll put roses in my hair, And ribbons in my sheen, And may be look as maiden-like As the bride ye bring hame.’ 18 Two of his sons he sent before, And two rade by his side, And three he left at hame wi her, She was the brightest bride. 19 As she was gazing her around, To view the rural plain, And there she saw the bridal folk, Merrily coming hame. 20 ‘Come here, come here, my boys a’, Ye see not what I see; For here I see your fair father, And a step-mother to thee. 21 ‘O shall I call him honey, Sandy, Husband, or my gude lord? Or shall I call him my gude master, Let well or woe betide?’ 22 ‘Ye winna call him honey, mother, For angering o the bride; But ye'll call him your gude master, Let well or woe betide.’ 23 She buskd her bonny boys in black, Herself in simple green, A kaim o gowd upon her hair, As maiden she had been. 24 She's taen the white bread in her lap, The wine glass in her hand, And she's gane out upo the green, To welcome the bride hame. 25 She woudna ca him her ain gude lord, For angering o the bride: ‘Ye're welcome hame, my gude master, Your lands lie braid and wide.’ 26 ‘O fair mat fa you, Fair Annie, Sae well's ye've welcomd me; Ye might hae welcomd my new bride; Some gift to you she'll gie.’ 27 ‘Ye're welcome hame, ye new-come bride, To your ha's and your bowers; Ye're welcome hame, my lady gay, Ye're whiter than the flowers.’ 28 ‘O wha is this,’ the bride did say, ‘Sae well that welcomes me?

And what means a' this bonny boys, That follow at her heel?’ 38 ‘This is my sister, Fair Annie, That serves this day sae well, And these are a' her bauld brothers, That follow at her heel.’ 39 Then out it speaks the new-come bride, Was full o jealousie: ‘I fear there's something new, my lord, Ye mean to hide frae me. 40 ‘But if she be your light leman Has me sae sair beguild, She shall gae out at my window, And range the woods sae wild.’ 41 When day was dane, and night drew on, And a' man bound for bed, The bridegroom and the new-come bride In ae chamber were laid. 42 The lady being left alone, Nursing her fair young son, She has taen up her gude lord's harp, She harped and she sung. 43 ‘Seven braw sons hae I born To the lord o this place; I wish they were seven hares To run the castle race, And I mysel a gude greyhound, To gie them a' a chace.’ 44 ‘Lie near, lie near, my ain gude lord, Lie near and speak wi me; There is a woman in the house, She will be wild ere day.’ 45 ‘Lie still, lie still, my new-come bride, Lie still and take your rest; The pale's out o my wine-puncheon, And lang it winna rest.’ 46 She held the harp still in her hand, To harp them baith asleep, And aye she harped and she sang, And saut tears she did weep. 47 ‘Seven braw sons hae I born To the gude lord o this ha; I wish that they were seven brown rats, To climb the castle wa, And I mysel a gude grey cat, To take them ane and a'.’ 48 ‘Lie near, lie near, my ain gude lord, Lie near and speak wi me; There is a woman in this house, She will be wild ere day.’ 49 ‘Lie yond, lie yond, my new-come bride, My sheets are wonderous cauld; I woudna hear my love's lament For your gowd ten thousand fauld.’ 50 ‘O wae be to you, ye fause lord, Some ill death mat ye die!

And ran low by his side. 2 He has ridden, and she has run, Till they came to yon water wan; He has ridden, and she has run, Like to his waiting man. 3 He has ridden, and she has run, Till they came on to Clyde; The knight he rode on high horseback, But the lady she bot wide. 4 The first step that the lady stepped, She stept into the knee; The bairn that was between her sides There he gied spartles three. 5 ‘Lie still, lie still, my bonny boy, Ye work your mother woe; Your father rides on high horseback, Cares little for us two.’ 6 The nextand step that lady stepped. She stept into the pap; The bairn that was between her sides There spartled and he lap. 7 ‘Ly still, ly still, my bonny boy, You work your mother's woe; Your father rides on high horseback, Cares little for us two.’ 8 In the middle of that water There stands a yird-fast stone; He turnd his horse head back again, Said, Lady, loup ye on. 9 She hadna ridden a mile, a mile, O never a mile but ane, Till she grew sick, and so weary She couldna ride nor gang. 10 ‘Ride on, ride on, my gay lady, You see not what I see; For yonder is my father's castle, A little beyond the lee, And ye'll get ane of my father's men, But, lady, neer lippen on me.’ 11 There were four and twenty bonny ladies Led Willie frae bower to ha, But the bonniest lady among them a' Led his steed to the sta. 12 When they were at the table set, And sitting at their dine, Out it spake his mother dear, And she spake aye in time. 13 ‘Sometimes your boy's red, Willie, And other times he's wan; He looks like a woman wi bairn, But no ways like a man.’ 14 ‘Win up, win up, my bonny boy, Go look your master's steed; See that his meat be at his head, And not among his feet.’ 15 O healy, healy raise she up, And healy gaed she down, And healy opend the stable-door, And as healy gaed she in, And even among that big horse feet She bear her dear young son. 16 As Willie's mother was walking alone, Between the bower and ha, She thought she heard a bairn's greet And lady's moan in the sta. 17 ‘Gude make ye safe, my ae son Willie, Gude keep ye safe frae harm; Ye might hae chosen a lighter foot-boy Than a women in travilling.’ 18 He hit the table wi his foot, He kept it wi his knee, Till silver cups and silver spoons Into the floor did flee. 19 There were fifteen steps into that stair, I wat he made them a' but three; He's to the stable gane in haste, And a' to see his gay lady. 20 ‘I am not come o sic low kin, Nor yet sic low degree, That you needed to banish me frae your sight, That ye left nae woman wi me.’ 21 ‘I wish I'd drunken the wan water When I did drink the wine, Or when I left my lady gay, And her at sic a time. 22 ‘But up ye'll take my dear young son, And wash him wi the milk, And up ye'll take my lady gay And row her in the silk; For her kirking and her fair wedding Shall baith stand in ae day.’ Burd Alone CHILD WATERS—H Motherwell's MS., p. 277, from Marjory Johnston, servant to W.

That eer our loves began.’ 6 ‘Your dogs may eat the gude white bread, And I the dust and bran; Yet will I sing, and say, well's me, That eer our loves began.’ 7 ‘My horse shall drink the gude red wine, And you the water wan; And then you'll sigh, and say, alas! That eer our loves began.’ 8 ‘Your horse may drink the gude red wine, And I the water wan; But yet I'll sing, and say, well's me, That eer our loves began.’ 9 Then Willie lap on his white steed, And straight awa did ride; Burd Helen, drest in men's array, She walked by his side. 10 But he was neer sae lack a knight As ance woud bid her ride, And she was neer sae mean a may As ance woud bid him bide. 11 Sweet Willie rade, Burd Helen ran, A livelang summer's tide, Until she came to wan water, For a' men ca's it Clyde. 12 The first an step that she wade in, She wadit to the knee; ‘Ohon, alas!’ said that fair maid, ‘This water's nae for me!’ 13 The next an step that she wade in, She wadit to the pap; The babe within her sides twa, Cauld water gart it quack. 14 ‘Lie still, lie still, my bonny bairn, For a' this winna dee; Your father rides on high horseback, Minds neither you nor me.’ 15 In the midst of Clyde's water, There stands a yird-fast stone; There he leant him ower his saddle-bow, And set that lady on, And brought her to the other side, Then set her down again. 16 ‘O see ye not yon goodly towers, And gowd towers stand sae hie? There is a lady in yonder bower Will sinder you and me.’ 17 ‘I wish nae ill to your lady, She neer wishd nane to me; But I wish the maid maist o your love That drees far mair for thee. 18 ‘I wish nae ill to your lady, She neer comes in my thought; But I wish the maid maist o your love That dearest hae you bought.’ 19 Four an twenty gay ladies Led Willie thro bower and ha; But the fairest lady amo them a' Led his horse to the sta. 20 Four an twenty gay ladies Were a' at dinner set; Burd Helen sat at a by-table, A bit she coudna eat. 21 Out it spake her Dow Isbel, A skilly dame was she: ‘O whare got ye this fine foot-page Ye've brought alang wi thee? 22 ‘Sometimes his colour waxes red, Sometimes it waxes wan; He is liker a woman big wi bairn Nor be a waiting man.’ 23 ‘Win up, win up, my boy,’ he says, ‘At my bidding to be, And gang and supper my gude steed, See he be litterd tee.’ 24 Then she is into stable gane, Shut tee the door wi a pin, And even amang Willie's horse feet Brought hame her bonny young son. 25 When day was gane, and night was come, And a' man bound for bed, Sweet Willie and Dow Isbel In ae chamber were laid. 26 They hadna been well lien down, Nor yet well faen asleep, Till up it wakens Sweet Willie, And stood at Dow Isbel's feet. 27 ‘I dreamd a dreary dream this night, I wish it may be for guid; Some rogue hae broke my stable-door, And stown awa my steed. 28 ‘Win up, win up now, Dow Isbel, At my bidding to be, And ye'll gae to my stable-door, See that be true or lie.’ 29 When she gaed to the stable-door, She heard a grievous groan; She thought she heard a bairn greet, But and a woman's moan. 30 ‘When I was in my bigly bower, I wore but what I would; This night I'm lighter 'mang Willie's horse feet, I fear I'll die for cold. 31 ‘When I was in my bigly bower, I wore gold to my tae; This night I'm lighter mang Willie's horse feet, And fear I'll die or day. 32 ‘When I was in my bigly bower, I wore scarlet and green; This night I'm lighter mang Willie's horse feet, And fear I'll die my lane.’ 33 Dow Isbel now came tripping hame, As fast as gang coud she; ‘I thought your page was not a man, Ye brought alang wi thee. 34 ‘As I gaed to your stable, Willie, I heard a grievous groan; I thought I heard a bairn greet, But and a woman's moan. 35 ‘She said, when in her bigly bower, She wore but what she would; But this night is lighter mang your horse feet, And fears she'll die for cold. 36 ‘She said, when in her bigly bower, She wore gold to her tae; But this night is lighter mang your horse feet, And fears she'll die or day. 37 ‘Win up, win up, now Sweet Willie, At my bidding to be, And speak some comfort to the maid, That's dreed sae much for thee.’ 38 He is to the stable door gane, As fast as gang coud he; ‘O open, O open, Burd Helen,’ he says, ‘Ye'll open the door to me.’ 39 ‘That was never my mother's custom, And hope it's never be mine, A knight into her companie, When she drees a' her pine.’ 40 ‘O open the door, Burd Helen,’ he says, ‘O open the door to me; For as my sword hangs by my gair, I'll gar it gang in three.’ 41 ‘How can I open, how shall I open, How can I open to thee, When lying amang your great steed's feet, Your young son on my knee?’ 42 He hit the door then wi his foot, Sae did he wi his knee, Till doors o deal, and locks o steel, In splinders gart he flee. 43 ‘An asking, asking, Sweet Willie, An asking ye'll grant me; The warst in bower in a' your towers, For thy young son and me.’ 44 ‘Your asking's nae sae great, Burd Helen, But granted it shall be; The best in bower in a' my towers, For my young son and thee.’ 45 ‘An asking, asking, sweet Willie, An asking ye'll grant me; The warst an woman about your bowers, To wait on him and me.’ 46 ‘The best an woman about my bowers, To wait on him and thee, And that's my sister Dow Isbel, And a gude woman is she. 47 ‘Ye will take up my little young son, And wash him wi the milk; And ye'll take up my gay lady, And row her in the silk. 48 ‘Be favourable to my lady, Be favourable, if ye may; Her kirking and her fair wedding Shall baith stand on ae day. 49 ‘There is not here a woman living But her shall be my bride, And all is for the fair speeches I got frae her at Clyde.’ CHILD WATERS—K 1 Willie was a harper guid, He was a harper fine; He harped the burds out of the tree, The fish out of the flood, The milk out of a woman's brist That bab had never nean. 2 He harped out, an he harped in, Till he harped them a' aslep, Unless it was her Fair Elen, An she stood on her feett. 3 Willie stod in stabile dor, He said he wad ride, 4 ‘Na women mane gae we me, Hellen, Na women mane gaie we me Bat them that will saddle my hors, An bridell my steed, An elky toun that I come to A lish of hons mane lead.’ 5 ‘I will saddle yer hors, Willie, An I will bridel yer steed, An elky toun att we come tell A leash of honds will lead.’ 6 ‘The dogs sall eat the gued fite bread, An ye the douë pran, An ye sall bliss, an na curse, That ever ye lied a man.’ 7 ‘The dogs sall eat the whit bread, An me the douë pran, An I will bliss, an na curs, That ear I loved a man.’ 8 She has saddled his hors, An she has bridled his stead, An ealky toun att they came throu A lish of honds did lead. 9 The dogs did eatt the whit bread, An her the douey pran, An she did bliss, an she did na curs, That ever she loyed a man. 10 Fan they came to yon wan water That a' man caas Clayd, He louked over his left shoder, Says, Ellen, will ye ride?

O what's your will wi me?’ 3 ‘My will wi you, Fair Janet,’ he said, ‘It is both bed and board; Some say that ye loe Sweet Willie, But ye maun wed a French lord.’ 4 ‘A French lord maun I wed, father? A French lord maun I wed? Then, by my sooth,’ quo Fair Janet, ‘He's neer enter my bed.’ 5 Janet's awa to her chamber, As fast as she could go; Wha's the first ane that tapped there, But Sweet Willie her jo? 6 ‘O we maun part this love, Willie, That has been lang between; There's a French lord coming oer the sea, To wed me wi a ring; There's a French lord coming oer the sea, To wed and tak me hame.’ 7 ‘If we maun part this love, Janet, It causeth mickle woe; If we maun part this love, Janet, It makes me into mourning go.’ 8 ‘But ye maun gang to your three sisters, Meg, Marion, and Jean; Tell them to come to Fair Janet, In case that her days are dune.’ 9 Willie's awa to his three sisters, Meg, Marion, and Jean: ‘O haste, and gang to Fair Janet, I fear that her days are dune.’ 10 Some drew to them their silken hose, Some drew to them their shoon, Some drew to them their silk manteils, Their coverings to put on, And they're awa to Fair Janet, By the hie light o the moon. 11 ‘O I have born this babe, Willie, Wi mickle toil and pain; Take hame, take hame, your babe, Willie, For nurse I dare be nane.’ 12 He's tane his young son in his arms, And kisst him cheek and chin, And he's awa to his mother's bower, By the hie light o the moon. 13 ‘O open, open, mother,’ he says, ‘O open, and let me in; The rain rains on my yellow hair, And the dew drops oer my chin, And I hae my young son in my arms, I fear that his days are dune.’ 14 With her fingers lang and sma She lifted up the pin, And with her arms lang and sma Received the baby in. 15 ‘Gae back, gae back now, Sweet Willie, And comfort your fair lady; For where ye had but ae nourice, Your young son shall hae three.’ 16 Willie he was scarce awa, And the lady put to bed, Whan in and came her father dear: ‘Make haste, and busk the bride.’ 17 ‘There's a sair pain in my head, father, There's a sair pain in my side; And ill, O ill, am I, father, This day for to be a bride.’ 18 ‘O ye maun busk this bonny bride, And put a gay mantle on; For she shall wed this auld French lord, Gin she should die the morn.’ 19 Some put on the gay green robes, And some put on the brown; But Janet put on the scarlet robes, To shine foremost throw the town. 20 And some they mounted the black steed, And some mounted the brown; But Janet mounted the milk-white steed, To ride foremost throw the town. 21 ‘O wha will guide your horse, Janet? O wha will guide him best?’ ‘O wha but Willie, my true-love? He kens I loe him best.’ 22 And when they cam to Marie's kirk, To tye the haly ban, Fair Janet's cheek looked pale and wan, And her colour gaed an cam. 23 When dinner it was past and done, And dancing to begin, ‘O we'll go take the bride's maidens, And we'll go fill the ring.’ 24 O ben than cam the auld French lord, Saying, Bride, will ye dance with me? ‘Awa, awa, ye auld French lord, Your face I downa see.’ 25 O ben than cam now Sweet Willie, He cam with ane advance: ‘O I'll go tak the bride's maidens, And we'll go tak a dance.’ 26 ‘I've seen ither days wi you, Willie, And so has mony mae, Ye would hae danced wi me mysel, Let a' my maidens gae.’ 27 O ben than cam now Sweet Willie, Saying, Bride, will ye dance wi me? ‘Aye, by my sooth, and that I will, Gin my back should break in three.’ 28 She had nae turned her throw the dance, Throw the dance but thrice, Whan she fell doun at Willie's feet, And up did never rise. 29 Willie's taen the key of his coffer, And gien it to his man: ‘Gae hame, and tell my mother dear My horse he has me slain; Bid her be kind to my young son, For father he has nane.’ 30 The tane was buried in Marie's kirk, And the tither in Marie's quire; Out of the tane there grew a birk, And the tither a bonny brier. Fair Janet and Sweet William FAIR JANET—B Motherwell's MS., p. 357, from the recitation of Agnes Lyle, Kilbarchan. 1 ‘If you do love me weel, Willie, Ye'll shew to me truelie; Ye'll build to me a bonnie ship, And set her on the sea.’ 2 He did love her very weel, He shewed to her trulie; He builded her a bonnie ship, And set her on the sea. 3 They had not sailed one league, one league, One league but only three, Till sharp, sharp showers fair Janet took, She grew sick and like to die. 4 ‘If you do love me weel, Willie, Ye'll shew to me trulye; Ye'll tak me to my mother's bower, Whare I was wont to be.’ 5 He did love her very weel, He shewed to her trulye; He took her to her mother's bower, Whare she was wont to be. 6 ‘It's ye'll stand up at my richt side, You will on tiptaes stand, Until you hear your auld son weep, But an your Janet mourn. 7 ‘Come take your auld son in your arms, He is both large and lang; Come take your auld son in your arms, And for a nourice gang.’ 8 He is to his mother's bowers, An hour or it struck nine: ‘I have a babe into my arms, He'll die for nouricing.’ 9 ‘Goe home, go home, my son,’ she says, ‘And mak thy Jenny blythe; If ae nurse winna sere her son, It's I'll provide him five.’ 10 Fair Janet was nae weel lichter, Nor weel doun on her side, Till ben and cam her father dear, Saying, Wha will busk our bride? 11 Ben and cam her brethren dear, Saying, Wha will busk our bride? And wha will saddle our bride's horse? Whom ahint will she ride? 12 ‘Hold your tongue, my brethren dear, And let your folly be, For I'm sae fair and full of hair Sma busking will serve me. 13 ‘Hold your tongue, my brethren dear, And let your folly be, For I will ride behint William, He will best wait on me. 14 ‘Willie, lay the saddle saft, And lead the bridle soun, And when we come to Mary's Kirk, Ye'll set me hooly down.’ 15 Supper scarslie was owre, Nor musick weel fa'n to, Till ben and cam the bride's brethren, Saying, Bride, ye'll dance wi me: ‘Awa, awa, my brethren dear, For dancing's no for me.’ 16 Ben and came her ain bridegroom, Saying, Bride, ye'll dance wi me; She says, Awa, awa, ye southland dog, Your face I downa see. 17 Ben and cam then Sweet Willie, Saying, Bride, ye'll dance wi me: ‘Oh I will dance the floor once owre, Tho my heart should break in three.’ 18 ‘Oh no, oh no,’ said Sweet William, ‘Let no such things eer be; But I will cut my glove in two, And I'll dance for thee and me.’ 19 She hadna danced the floor once owre, I'm sure she hadna thrice, Till she fell in a deadly swound, And from it neer did rise. 20 Out and spak her ain bridegroom, And an angry man was he: ‘This day she has gien me the gecks, Yet she must bear the scorn; There's not a bell in merry Linkum Shall ring for her the morn.’ 21 Out and spoke then Sweet William, And a sorry man was he: ‘Altho she has gien you the gecks, She will not bear the scorn; There's not a bell in merry Linkum But shall ring for her the morn.’ 22 There was not a bell in merry Linkum But they tinkled and they rang, And a' the birds that flew above, They changed their notes and sang. Willie and Annet FAIR JANET—C Herd's Scots Songs, 1769, p. 303: I, 162, ed. 1776. 1 Livd ance twa luvers in yon dale, And they luvd ither weel; Frae evning late to morning aire Of luving luvd their fill. 2 ‘Now, Willie, gif you luve me weel, As sae it seems to me, Gar build, gar build a bonny schip, Gar build it speedilie. 3 ‘And we will sail the sea sae green, Unto some far countrie, Or we'll sail to some bonie isle, Stands lanely midst the sea.’ 4 But lang or ere the schip was built, Or deckd, or rigged out, Came sick a pain in Annet's back That down she coud na lout. 5 ‘Now, Willie, gif ye luve me weel, As sae it seems to me, O haste, haste, bring me to my bowr, And my bowr-maidens three.’ 6 He's taen her in his arms twa, And kissd her, cheik and chin; He's brocht her to her ain sweet bowr, But nae bowr-maid was in. 7 ‘Now leave my bower, Willie,’ she said, ‘Now leave me to my lane; Was nevir man in a lady's bower When she was travelling.’ 8 He's stepped three steps down the stair, Upon the marble stane; Sae loud's he heard his young son's greet, But and his lady's mane! 9 ‘Now come, now come, Willie,’ she said, ‘Tak your young son frae me, And hie him to your mother's bower, With speed and privacie.’ 10 He's taen his young son in his arms, He's kissd him, cheik and chin; He's hied him to his mother's bower, By th' ae light of the moon. 11 And with him came the bold barone, And he spake up wi pride: ‘Gar seek, gar seek the bower-maidens, Gar busk, gar busk the bryde.’ 12 ‘My maidens, easy with my back, And easy with my side; O set my saddle saft, Willie, I am a tender bryde.’ 13 When she came to the burrow-town, They gied her a broch and ring, And when she came to , They had a fair wedding. 14 O up then spake the norland lord, And blinkit wi his ee: ‘I trow this lady's born a bairn,’ Then laucht loud lauchters three. 15 And up then spake the brisk bridegroom, And he spake up wi pryde: ‘Gin I should pawn my wedding-gloves, I will dance wi the bryde.’ 16 ‘Now had your tongue, my lord,’ she said, ‘Wi dancing let me be; I am sae thin in flesh and blude, Sma dancing will serve me.’ 17 But she's taen Willie be the hand, The tear blinded her ee: ‘But I wad dance wi my true-luve, But bursts my heart in three.’ 18 She's taen her bracelet frae her arm, Her garter frae her knee: ‘Gie that, gie that to my young son, He'll neer his mother see.’ 19 ‘Gar deal, gar deal the bread, mother, Gar deal, gar deal the wyne;

It's where ye had but ae nourice, Thy auld son he'll hae four.’ 7 His lady was scarsely in her bed, Nor well faln owre asleep, When four and twenty knights and lords Came for the bride at last. 8 They dressed her up, they dressed her down, They dressed her wondrous fine, And just before her ain bedside She lost her colour clean. 9 ‘Be hooly wi my head, maidens, Be hooly wi my hair, For it was washen late last night, And now it's very sair.’ 10 Out then spoke a southern lord, And oh but he spak bauld: ‘She is the likest that bore a child That eer my eyes did see.’ 11 Up then spak her auld, auld father, And oh he spoke in time: ‘She neer bore a child since her birth Except it was yestreen.’ 12 Out then spoke a northern lord: ‘It's bride, will ye dance wi me?’ ‘Oh no, oh no, you northland lord, It's dancing's no for me.’ 13 Out then spoke a southland lord: ‘It's bride, will ye dance wi me?’ ‘Oh no, oh no, you southland lord, I would as lief chuse to die.’ 14 Out then spoke her ain bridegroom: ‘O bride, will ye dance wi me?’ ‘Oh no, oh no, my ain bridegroom, It's dancing's no for me.’ 15 Out then spoke her ain Willy, And oh he spoke fu fine: ‘O bride, O bride, will ye dance wi me,’ 16 ‘Oh yes, oh yes, Willie,’ she said, ‘It's I will dance with thee;

And Janet she took sair pains, And O but she grew ill. 2 ‘Fetch a woman to me, Willie, O fetch a woman to me, For without the help of woman, Willie, Surely I will dee.’ 3 ‘O tie a napkin on my face, That naething I may see, And what can a woman do, Janet, But I will do for thee?’ 4 She was na scarcely brought to bed, Nor yet laid on her side, Till in and cam her father there, Crying, Fy, gae busk the bride. 5 ‘A wearyed bride am I, father, A wearyed bride am I; Must I gae wed that southlan lord, And let Sweet Willie abe?’ 6 ‘Now chuse, now chuse now, Fair Janet, What shall your cleeding be; Now chuse, now chuse now, Fair Janet, And I will gie it to thee. 7 ‘Whether will you hae it of the berry brown, Or of the holland green; Or will you hae it of the crimson red, Most lovely to be seen?’ 8 ‘I will not hae't of the berry brown, Nor yet o the holly green; But I will hae't of the crimson red, Most lovely to be seen.’ 9 ‘Now chuse, now chuse now, Fair Janet, What man you'll ride behind:’ ‘O wha sae fitting as Sweet Willie? He'll fit my saddle fine.’ 10 O they rode on, and they rode on, Till they cam to Merrytown green; But Sweet Willie and Fair Janet Cam aye hoolie ahin. 11 O whan they cam to Merrytown, And lighted on the green, Monie a bluidy aith was sworn That our bride was wi bairn. 12 Out and spake the bonny bride, And she swore by her fingers ten: ‘If eer I was wi bairn in my life, I was lighter sin yestreen.’ 13 Up and raise he the bridegroom, Says, Bride, will ye dance wi me? ‘Dance on, dance on, bridegroom,’ she says, ‘For I'll dance nane wi thee.’ 14 Up and raise her father then, Says, Bride, will ye dance wi me? ‘Dance on, my father,’ she replied, ‘I pray thee let me be.’ 15 Then up and raise he Sweet Willie, And he had meikle pride: ‘I'll lay my gloves in the bride's han, And I'll dance for the bride.’ 16 ‘O no, O no, O Sweet Willie, O no, that shall na be; For I will dance wi thee, Willie, Tho my back should fa in three.’ 17 She had na run a reel, a reel, A reel but barely three, Till pale and wan grew Fair Janet, And her head took Willie's knee. 18 Out and spake then the bridegroom, And he spake wi great scorn: ‘There's not a bell in Merrytown kirk Shall ring for her the morn.’ 19 Out and spak he Sweet Willie, And his heart was almost gane: ‘'Tis a the bells in Merrytown kirk Shall ring for her the morn.’ 20 Willie was buried in Mary's kirk, etc., etc., etc. Sweet Willie and Fair Maisry FAIR JANET —F Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 97; Motherwell's MS., p. 606. 1 Hey, love Willie, and how, love Willie, And Willie my love shall be; They're thinking to sinder our lang love, Willie; It's mair than man can dee. 2 ‘Ye'll mount me quickly on a steed, A milk-white steed or gray, And carry me on to gude greenwood, Before that it be day.’ 3 He mounted her upon a steed, He chose a steed o gray; He had her on to gude greenwood, Before that it was day. 4 ‘O will ye gang to the cards, Meggie? Or will ye gang wi me? Or will ye hae a bower-woman, To stay ere it be day?’ 5 ‘I winna gang to the cards,’ she said, ‘Nor will I gae wi thee, Nor will I hae a bower-woman, To spoil my modestie. 6 ‘Ye'll gie me a lady at my back, An a lady me beforn, An a midwife at my twa sides, Till your young son be born. 7 ‘Ye'll do me up, and further up, To the top o yon greenwood tree; For every pain myself shall hae, The same pain ye maun drie.’ 8 The first pain that did strike Sweet Willie, It was into the side; Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie, These pains are ill to bide! 9 The nextan pain that strake Sweet Willie, It was into the back; Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie, These pains are women's wreck! 10 The nextan pain that strake Sweet Willie, It was into the head; Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie, I fear my lady's dead! 11 Then he's gane on, and further on, At the foot o yon greenwood tree; There he got his lady lighter, Wi his young son on her knee. 12 Then he's taen up his little young son, And kissd him, cheek and chin, And he is on to his mother, As fast as he could gang. 13 ‘Ye will take in my son, mother, Gie him to nurses nine; Three to wauk, and three to sleep, And three to gang between.’ 14 Then he has left his mother's house, And frae her he has gane, And he is back to his lady, And safely brought her hame. 15 Then in it came her father dear, Was belted in a brand: ‘It's nae time for brides to lye in bed, When the bridegroom's send's in town. 16 ‘There are four-and-twenty noble lords A' lighted on the green; The fairest knight amang them a', He must be your bridegroom.’ 17 ‘O wha will shoe my foot, my foot? And wha will glove my hand? And wha will prin my sma middle, Wi the short prin and the lang?’ 18 Now out it speaks him Sweet Willie, Who knew her troubles best: ‘It is my duty for to serve, As I'm come here as guest. 19 ‘Now I will shoe your foot, Maisry, And I will glove your hand, And I will prin your sma middle, Wi the sma prin and the lang.’ 20 ‘Wha will saddle my steed,’ she says, ‘And gar my bridle ring? And wha will hae me to gude church-door, This day I'm ill abound?’ 21 ‘I will saddle your steed, Maisry, And gar your bridle ring, And I'll hae you to gude church-door, And safely set you down.’ 22 ‘O healy, healy take me up, And healy set me down, And set my back until a wa, My foot to yird-fast stane.’ 23 He healy took her frae her horse, And healy set her down, And set her back until a wa, Her foot to yird-fast stane. 24 When they had eaten and well drunken, And a' had thornd fine, The bride's father he took the cup, For to serve out the wine. 25 Out it speaks the bridegroom's brother, An ill death mat he die! ‘I fear our bride she's born a bairn, Or else has it a dee.’ 26 She's taen out a Bible braid, And deeply has she sworn; ‘If I hae born a bairn,’ she says, ‘Sin yesterday at morn, 27 ‘Or if I've born a bairn,’ she says, ‘Sin yesterday at noon, There's nae a lady amang you a' That woud been here sae soon.’ 28 Then out it spake the bridegroom's man, Mischance come ower his heel! ‘Win up, win up, now bride,’ he says, ‘And dance a shamefu reel.’ 29 Then out it speaks the bride hersell, And a sorry heart had she: ‘Is there nae ane amang you a' Will dance this dance for me?’ 30 Then out it speaks him Sweet Willie, And he spake aye thro pride: ‘O draw my boots for me, bridegroom, Or I dance for your bride.’ 31 Then out it spake the bride hersell: O na, this maunna be; For I will dance this dance mysell, Tho my back shoud gang in three. 32 She hadna well gane thro the reel, Nor yet well on the green, Till she fell down at Willie's feet As cauld as ony stane. 33 He's taen her in his arms twa, And haed her up the stair; Then up it came her jolly bridegroom, Says, What's your business there? 34 Then Willie lifted up his foot, And dang him down the stair, And brake three ribs o the bridegroom's side, And a word he spake nae mair. 35 Nae meen was made for that lady, When she was lying dead; But a' was for him Sweet Willie, On the fields for he ran mad. Sweet Willie FAIR JANET—G Finlay's Scottish Ballads, II, 61. 1 ‘Will you marry the southland lord, A queen of fair England to be? Or will you burn for Sweet Willie, The morn upon yon lea?’ 2 ‘I will marry the southland lord, Father, sen it is your will; But I'd rather it were my burial-day, For my grave I'm going till. 3 ‘O go, O go now, my bower-wife, O go now hastilie, O go now to Sweet Willie's bower, And bid him cum speak to me.’ 4 And he is to his mother's bower, As fast as he could rin: ‘Open, open, my mother dear, Open, and let me in. 5 ‘For the rain rains on my yellow hair, The dew stands on my chin, And I have something in my lap, And I wad fain be in.’ 6 ‘O go, O go now, Sweet Willie, And make your lady blithe, For wherever you had ae nourice, Your young son shall hae five.’ 7 Out spak Annet's mother dear, An she spak a word o' pride; Says, Whare is a' our bride's maidens, They're no busking the bride? 8 ‘O haud your tongue, my mother dear, Your speaking let it be, For I'm sae fair and full o flesh Little busking will serve me.’ 9 Out an spak the bride's maidens, They spak a word o pride; Says, Whare is a' the fine cleiding? It's we maun busk the bride. 10 ‘Deal hooly wi my head, maidens, Deal hooly wi my hair; For it was washen late yestreen, And it is wonder sair.’ 11 And Willie swore a great, great oath, And he swore by the thorn, That she was as free o a child that night As the night that she was born. 12 ‘Ye hae gien me the gowk, Annet, But I'll gie you the scorn; For there's no a bell in a' the town Shall ring for you the morn.’ 13 Out and spak then Sweet Willie: Sae loud's I hear you lie! There's no a bell in a' the town But shall ring for Annet and me. 65 LADY MAISRY Lord Maisry LADY MAISRY—A Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 24. 1 The young lords o the north country Have all a wooing gone, To win the love of Lady Maisry, But o them she woud hae none. 2 O they hae courted Lady Maisry Wi a' kin kind of things; An they hae sought her Lady Maisry Wi brotches an wi' rings. 3 An they ha sought her Lady Maisry Frae father and frae mother; An they ha sought her Lady Maisry Frae sister an frae brother. 4 An they ha followd her Lady Maisry Thro chamber an thro ha; But a' that they coud say to her, Her answer still was Na. 5 ‘O had your tongues, young men,’ she says, ‘An think nae mair o me; For I've gien my love to an English lord, An think nae mair o me.’ 6 Her father's kitchy-boy heard that, An ill death may he dee! An he is on to her brother, As fast as gang coud he. 7 ‘O is my father an my mother well, But an my brothers three? Gin my sister Lady Maisry be well, There's naething can ail me.’ 8 ‘Your father and your mother is well, But an your brothers three; Your sister Lady Maisry's well, So big wi bairn gangs she.’ 9 ‘Gin this be true you tell to me, My mailison light on thee! But gin it be a lie you tell, You sal be hangit hie.’ 10 He's done him to his sister's bowr, Wi meikle doole an care; An there he saw her Lady Maisry, Kembing her yallow hair. 11 ‘O wha is aught that bairn,’ he says, ‘That ye sae big are wi? And gin ye winna own the truth, This moment ye sall dee.’ 12 She turnd her right an roun about, An the kem fell frae her han; A trembling seizd her fair body, An her rosy cheek grew wan. 13 ‘O pardon me, my brother dear, An the truth I'll tell to thee; My bairn it is to Lord William, An he is betrothd to me.’ 14 ‘O coud na ye gotten dukes, or lords, Intill your ain country, That ye draw up wi an English dog, To bring this shame on me? 15 ‘But ye maun gi up the English lord, Whan youre young babe is born; For, gin you keep by him an hour langer, Your life sall be forlorn.’ 16 ‘I will gi up this English blood, Till my young babe be born; But the never a day nor hour langer, Tho my life should be forlorn.’ 17 ‘O whare is a' my merry young men, Whom I gi meat and fee, To pu the thistle and the thorn, To burn this wile whore wi?’ 18 ‘O whare will I get a bonny boy, To help me in my need, To rin wi hast to Lord William, And bid him come wi speed?’ 19 O out it spake a bonny boy, Stood by her brother's side: ‘O I would rin your errand, lady, Oer a' the world wide. 20 ‘Aft have I run your errands, lady, Whan blawn baith win and weet; But now I'll rin your errand, lady, Wi sat tears on my cheek.’ 21 O whan he came to broken briggs, He bent his bow and swam, An whan he came to the green grass growin, He slackd his shoone and ran. 22 O whan he came to Lord William's gates, He baed na to chap or ca, But set his bent bow till his breast, An lightly lap the wa; An, or the porter was at the gate, The boy was i the ha. 23 ‘O is my biggins broken, boy? Or is my towers won? Or is my lady lighter yet, Of a dear daughter or son?’ 24 ‘Your biggin is na broken, sir, Nor is your towers won; But the fairest lady in a' the lan For you this day maun burn.’ 25 ‘O saddle me the black, the black, Or saddle me the brown; O saddle me the swiftest steed That ever rade frae a town.’ 26 Or he was near a mile awa, She heard his wild horse sneeze: ‘Mend up the fire, my false brother, It's na come to my knees.’ 27 O whan he lighted at the gate, She heard his bridle ring: ‘Mend up the fire, my false brother, It's far yet frae my chin. 28 ‘Mend up the fire to me, brother, Mend up the fire to me; For I see him comin hard an fast Will soon men't up to thee. 29 ‘O gin my hands had been loose, Willy, Sae hard as they are boun, I would have turnd me frae the gleed, And castin out your young son.’ 30 ‘O I'll gar burn for you, Maisry, Your father an your mother; An I'll gar burn for you, Maisry, Your sister an your brother. 31 ‘An I'll gar burn for you, Maisry, The chief of a' your kin; An the last bonfire that I come to, Mysel I will cast in.’ LADY MAISRY—B Motherwell's MS., p. 422, communicated by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. 1 In came her sister, Stepping on the floor; Says, It's telling me, my sister Janet, That you're become a whore. 2 ‘A whore, sister, a whore, sister? That's what I'll never be; I'm no so great a whore, sister, As liars does on me lee.’ 3 In came her brother, Stepping on the floor; Says, It's telling me, my sister Janet, That you're become a whore.’ 4 ‘A whore, brother, a whore, brother? A whore I'll never be; I'm no so bad a woman, brother, As liars does on me lee.’ 5 In came her mother, Stepping on the floor: ‘They are telling me, my daughter, That you're so soon become a whore.’ 6 ‘A whore, mother, a whore, mother? A whore I'll never be; I'm only with child to an English lord, Who promised to marry me.’ 7 In came her father, Stepping on the floor; Says, They tell me, my daughter Janet, That you are become a whore.’ 8 ‘A whore, father, a whore, father? A whore I'll never be; I'm but with child to an English lord, Who promisd to marry me.’ 9 Then in it came an old woman, The lady's nurse was she, And ere she could get out a word The tear blinded her ee. 10 ‘Your father's to the fire, Janet, Your brother's to the whin; All for to kindle a bold bonfire, To burn your body in.’ 11 ‘Where will I get a boy,’ she said, ‘Will gain gold for his fee, That would run unto fair England For my good lord to me?’ 12 ‘O I have here a boy,’ she said, ‘Will gain gold to his fee, For he will run to fair England For thy good lord to thee.’ 13 Now when he found a bridge broken, He bent his bow and swam, And when he got where grass did grow, He slacked it and ran. 14 And when he came to that lord's gate, Stopt not to knock or call, But set his bent bow to his breast And lightly leapt the wall; And ere the porter could open the gate, The boy was in the hall, 15 In presence of that noble lord, And fell down on his knee: ‘What is it, my boy,’ he cried, ‘Have you brought unto me? 16 ‘Is my building broke into? Or is my towers won? Or is my true-love delivered Of daughter or of son?’ 17 ‘Your building is not broke,’ he cried, ‘Nor is your towers won, Nor is your true-love delivered Of daughter nor of son; But if you do not come in haste, Be sure she will be gone. 18 ‘Her father is gone to the fire, Her brother to the whin, To kindle up a bold bonfire, To burn her body in.’ 19 ‘Go saddle to me the black,’ he cried, ‘And do it very soon; Get unto me the swiftest horse That ever rade from the town.’ 20 The first horse that he rade upon, For he was raven black, He bore him far, and very far, But failed in a slack. 21 The next horse that he rode upon, He was a bonny brown; He bore him far, and very far, But did at last fall down. 22 The next horse that he rode upon, He as the milk was white; Fair fall the mare that foaled that foal Took him to Janet's sight! 23 And boots and spurs, all as he was, Into the fire he lap, Got one kiss of her comely mouth, While her body gave a crack. 24 ‘O who has been so bold,’ he says, ‘This bonfire to set on? Or who has been so bold,’ he says, ‘Her body for to burn?’ 25 ‘O here are we,’ her brother said, ‘This bonfire who set on; And we have been so bold,’ he said, ‘Her body for to burn.’ 26 ‘O I'll cause burn for you, Janet, Your father and your mother; And I'll cause die for you, Janet, Your sister and your brother. 27 ‘And I'll cause mony back be bare, And mony shed be thin, And mony wife be made a widow, And mony ane want their son.’ Janet LADY MAISRY—C Motherwell's MS., p. 472. 1 Ben came to her father dear, Stepping upon the floor; Says, It's told me, my daughter Janet, That you're now become a whore. 2 ‘A whore, father, a whore, father? That's what I'll never be, Tho I am with bairn to an English lord, That first did marry me.’ 3 Soon after spoke her bower-woman, And sorely did she cry: ‘Oh woe is me, my lady fair, That ever I saw this day! 4 ‘For your father's to the fire, Janet, Your brother's to the whin, Even to kindle a bold bonefire, To burn your body in.’ 5 ‘Where will I get a bonnie boy, Will win gold to his fee, That will run on to fair England For my good lord to me?’ 6 ‘Oh here am I, your waiting-boy, Would win gold to my fee, And will carry any message for you, By land or yet by sea.’ 7 And when he fand the bridges broke, He bent his bow and swam, But when he fand the grass growing, He slacked it and ran. 8 And when he came to that lord's gate, Stopt not to knock nor call, But set his bent bow to his breast, And lightly lap the wall. 9 And ere the porter was at the gate The boy was in the hall, And in that noble lord's presence He on his knee did fall. 10 ‘O is my biggins broken?’ he said, ‘Or is my towers won? Or is my lady lighter yet, Of daughter or of son?’ 11 ‘Your biggins are not broken,’ he said, ‘Nor is your towers won, Nor is your lady lighter yet, Of daughter or of son; But if you stay a little time Her life it will be gone. 12 ‘For her father's gone to the fire, Her brother to the whin, Even to kindle a bold bonfire, To burn her body in.’ 13 ‘Go saddle for me in haste,’ he cried, ‘A brace of horses soon; Go saddle for me the swiftest steeds That ever rode to a town.’ 14 The first steed that he rade on, For he was as jet black, He rode him far, and very far, But he fell down in a slack. 15 The next steed that he rode on, He was a berry brown; He bore him far, and very far, But at the last fell down. 16 The next steed that he rode on, He was as milk so white; Fair fall the mare that foaled the foal Took him to Janet's lyke! 17 But boots and spurs, all as he was, Into the fire he lap, Took ae kiss of her comely mouth, While her body gave a crack. 18 ‘O who has been so bold,’ he said, ‘This bonfire to set on? Or who has been so bold,’ he cried, ‘My true-love for to burn?’ 19 Her father cried, I've been so bold This bonefire to put on; Her brother cried, We've been so bold Her body for to burn. 20 ‘Oh I shall hang for you, Janet, Your father and your brother; And I shall burn for you, Janet, Your sister and your mother. 21 ‘Oh I shall make many bed empty, And many shed be thin, And many a wife to be a widow, And many one want their son. 22 ‘Then I shall take a cloak of cloth, A staff made of the wand, And the boy who did your errand run Shall be heir of my land.’ Lady Margery LADY MAISRY—D Campbell MSS, II, 70. 1 Lady Margery was her mother's ain daughter, And her father's only heir, And she's away to Strawberry Castle, To learn some unco lair. 2 She hadna been in Strawberry Castle A year but only three, Till she has proved as big with child, As big as woman could be. 3 Word has to her father gone, As he pat on his shoon, That Lady Margery goes wi child, Unto some English loon. 4 Word has to her mother gane, As she pat on her gown, That Lady Margery goes wi child, Unto some English loon. 5 The father he likes her ill, The mother she likes her waur, But her father he wished her in a fire strang, To burn for ever mair. 6 ‘Will ye hae this auld man, Lady Margery, To be yeer warldly make? Or will ye burn in fire strang, For your true lover's sake?’ 7 ‘I wunna hae that old, old man To be my worldly make, But I will burn in fire strang, For my true lover's sake.’ 8 ‘O who will put of the pot? O who will put of the pan? And who will build a bale-fire, To burn her body in.’ 9 The brother took of the pot, The sister took of the pan, And her mother builded a bold bale-fire, To burn her body in. 10 ‘O where will I get a bony boy That will run my errand soon? That will run to Strawberry Castle, And tell my love to come soon?’ 11 But then started up a little boy, Near to that lady's kin: ‘Often have I gane your errands, madam, But now it is time to rin.’ 12 O when he came to Strawberry Castle, He tirled at the pin; There was nane sae ready as that lord himsell To let the young body in. 13 ‘O is my towers broken? Or is my castle wone? Or is my lady Margery lighter Of a daughter or a son?’ 14 ‘Your towers are not broken, Nor is your castle wone; But the fairest lady of a' the land For thee this day does burn.’ 15 ‘Go saddle for me the black, black horse, Go saddle to me the brown; Go saddle to me as swift a steed As ever man rade on.’ 16 They saddled to him the black horse, They saddled to him the brown; They've saddled to him as swift a steed As ever man rade on. 17 He put his foot into the stirrup, He bounded for to ride; The silver buttons lap of his breast, And his nose began to bleed. 18 He bursted fifteen gude stout steeds, And four o them were dappled gray, And the little foot-page ran aye before, Crying, Mend it, an ye may! 19 When he came to the bale-fire, He lighted wi a glent, Wi black boots and clean spurs, And through the fire he went. 20 He laid ae arm about her neck, And the other beneath her chin; He thought to get a kiss o her, But her middle it gade in twain. 21 ‘But who has been so false,’ he said, ‘And who has been sae cruel, To carry the timber from my ain wood To burn my dearest jewel? 22 ‘But I'll burn for ye, Lady Margery, Yeer father and yeer mother; And I'll burn for ye, Lady Margery, Yeer sister and yeer brother. 23 ‘I'll do for ye, Lady Margery, What never was done for nane; I'll make many lady lemanless, And many a clothing thin. 24 ‘And I'll burn for yeer sake, Lady Margery, The town that yeer burnt in, And [make] many a baby fatherless, That's naething o the blame.’ Lady Marjory LADY MAISRY—E Motherwell's MS., p. 1, from the recitation of Mrs Thomson, Kilbarchan, February 25, 1825; Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 234. 1 Lady Marjory was her mother's only daughter. Her father's only heir, O And she is awa to Strawberry Castle, To get some unco lair. O 2 She had na been in Strawberry Castle A twelve month and a day, Till Lady Marjory she gaes wi child, As big as she can gae. 3 Word is to her father gone, Before he got on his shoon, That Lady Marjory she gaes wi child, And it is to an Irish groom. 4 But word is to her mother gane, Before that she gat on her gown, That Lady Marjorie she goes wi child, To a lord of high renown. 5 ‘O wha will put on the pot?’ they said, ‘Or wha will put on the pan? Or wha will put on a bauld, bauld fire, To burn Lady Marjorie in?’ 6 Her father he put on the pot, Her sister put on the pan, And her brother he put on a bauld, bauld fire, To burn Lady Marjorie in; And her mother she sat in a golden chair, To see her daughter burn. 7 ‘But where will I get a pretty little boy, That will win hose and shoon, That will go quickly to Strawberry Castle And bid my lord come doun?’ 8 ‘O here am I a pretty boy, That'll win hose and shoon, That will rin quickly to Strawberry Castle, And bid thy lord come doun.’ 9 O when he came to broken brigs, He bent his bow and swam, And when he came to good dry land, He let down his foot and ran. 10 When he came to Strawberry Castle, He tirled at the pin; None was so ready as the gay lord himsell To open and let him in. 11 ‘O is there any of my towers burnt? Or any of my castles broken? Or is Lady Marjorie brought to bed, Of a daughter or a son?’ 12 ‘O there is nane of thy towers burnt, Nor nane of thy castles broken, But Lady Marjorie is condemned to die, To be burnt in a fire of oaken.’ 13 ‘O gar saddle to me the black,’ he said, ‘Gar saddle to me the brown; Gar saddle to me the swiftest steed That eer carried a man from town.’ 14 He left the black into the slap, The brown into the brae, But fair fa that bonny apple-gray That carried this gay lord away! 15 He took a little horn out of his pocket, And he blew't both loud and shrill, And the little life that was in her, She hearkend to it full weel. 16 ‘Beet on, beet on, my brother dear, I value you not one straw, For yonder comes my own true-love, I hear his horn blaw. 17 ‘Beet on, beet on, my father dear, I value you not a pin, For yonder comes my own true-love, I hear his bridle ring.’ 18 But when he came into the place, He lap unto the wa; He thought to get a kiss o her bonny lips, But her body fell in twa. 19 ‘Oh vow, oh vow, oh vow,’ he said, ‘Oh vow but ye've been cruel! Ye've taken the timber out of my own wood And burnt my ain dear jewel. 20 ‘Now for thy sake, Lady Marjorie, I'll burn both father and mother; And for thy sake, Lady Marjorie, I'll burn both sister and brother. 21 ‘And for thy sake, Lady Marjorie, I'll burn both kith and kin; But I will remember the pretty little boy That did thy errand rin.’ LADY MAISRY—F The Scots [Edinburgh] Magazine, 1822, LXXXIX, 734, communicated by W.

LADY MAISRY—G Notes and Queries, Second Series, IX, 193; communicated by A.J., Edinburgh, as learned by himself and an elder sister from an old washerwoman of East Dereham, Norfolk, in the early part of this century. 1 ‘My father was the first good man Who tied me to a stake; My mother was the first good woman Who did the fire make. 2 ‘My brother was the next good man Who did the fire fetch; My sister was the next good woman Who lighted it with a match. 3 ‘They blew the fire, they kindled the fire, Till it did reach my knee: “O mother, mother, quench the fire! The smoke will smother me.” 4 ‘O had I but my little foot-page, My errand he would run; He would run unto gay London, And bid my lord come home.’ 5 Then there stood by her sister's child, Her own dear sister's son: ‘O many an errand I've run for thee, And but this one I'll run.’ 6 He ran, where the bridge was broken down He bent his bow and swam; He swam till he came to the good green turf, He up on his feet and ran. 7 He ran till he came at his uncle's hall; His uncle sat at his meat: ‘Good mete, good mete, good uncle, I pray, O if you knew what I'd got to say, How little would you eat!’ 8 ‘O is my castle broken down, Or is my tower won? Or is my gay lady brought o bed, Of a daughter or a son?’ 9 ‘Your castle is not broken down, Your tower it is not won; Your gay lady is not brought to bed, Of a daughter or a son. 10 ‘But she has sent you a gay gold ring, With a posy round the rim, To know, if you have any love for her, You'll come to her burning.’ 11 He called down his merry men all, By one, by two, by three; He mounted on his milk-white steed, To go to Margery. 12 They blew the fire, they kindled the fire, Till it did reach her head: ‘O mother, mother, quench the fire! For I am nearly dead.’ 13 She turned her head on her left shoulder, Saw her girdle hang on the tree: ‘O God bless them that gave me that! They'll never give more to me.’ 14 She turned her head on her right shoulder, Saw her lord come riding home: ‘O quench the fire, my dear mother! For I am nearly gone.’ 15 He mounted off his milk-white steed, And into the fire he ran, Thinking to save his gay ladye, But he had staid too long. Young Prince James LADY MAISRY—H Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 103. 1 There stands a stane in wan water, It's lang ere it grew green; Lady Maisry sits in her bower door, Sewing at her silken seam. 2 Word's gane to her mother's kitchen, And to her father's ha, That Lady Maisry is big wi bairn — And her true-love's far awa. 3 When her brother got word of this, Then fiercely looked he: ‘Betide me life, betide me death, At Maisry's bower I'se be. 4 ‘Gae saddle to me the black, the black, Gae saddle to me the brown; Gae saddle to me the swiftest steed, To hae me to the town.’ 5 When he came to Maisry's bower, He turnd him round about, And at a little shott-window, He saw her peeping out. 6 ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow, Lady Maisry, God make you safe and free!’ ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow, my brother dear, What are your wills wi me?’ 7 ‘What's come o a' your green claithing, Was ance for you too side? And what's become o your lang stays, Was ance for you too wide?’ 8 ‘O he that made my claithing short, I hope he'll make them side; And he that made my stays narrow, I hope he'll make them wide.’ 9 ‘O is it to a lord o might, Or baron o high degree? Or is it to any o your father's boys, Rides in the chase him wi?’ 10 ‘It's no to any Scottish lord, Nor baron o high degree; But English James, that little prince, That has beguiled me.’ 11 ‘O was there not a Scots baron That could hae fitted thee, That thus you've lovd an Englishman, And has affronted me?’ 12 She turnd her right and round about, The tear blinded her ee: ‘What is the wrang I've done, brother, Ye look sae fierce at me?’ 13 ‘Will ye forsake that English blude, When your young babe is born?’ ‘I'll nae do that, my brother dear, Tho I shoud be forlorn.’ 14 ‘I'se cause a man put up the fire, Anither ca in the stake, And on the head o yon high hill I'll burn you for his sake. 15 ‘O where are all my wall-wight men, That I pay meat and fee, For to hew down baith thistle and thorn, To burn that lady wi?’ 16 Then he has taen her, Lady Maisry, And fast he has her bound; And he causd the fiercest o his men Drag her frae town to town. 17 Then he has causd ane of his men Hew down baith thistle and thorn; She carried the peats in her petticoat-lap, Her ainsell for to burn. 18 Then ane pat up this big bauld fire, Anither ca'd in the stake; It was to burn her Lady Maisry, All for her true-love's sake. 19 But it fell ance upon a day, Prince James he thought full lang; He minded on the lady gay He left in fair Scotland. 20 ‘O where will I get a little wee boy, Will win gowd to his fee, That will rin on to Adam's high tower, Bring tidings back to me?’ 21 ‘O here am I, a little wee boy, Will win gowd to my fee, That will rin on to Adam's high tower, Bring tidings back to thee.’ 22 Then he is on to Adam's high tower, As fast as gang coud he, And he but only wan in time The fatal sight to see. 23 He sat his bent bow to his breast, And ran right speedilie, And he is back to his master, As fast as gang coud he. 24 ‘What news, what news, my little wee boy? What news hae ye to me?’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my master dear, Bad news, as ye will see.’ 25 ‘Are ony o my biggins brunt, my boy? Or ony o my towers won? Or is my lady lighter yet, O dear daughter or son?’ 26 ‘There's nane o your biggins brunt, master, Nor nane o your towers won, Nor is your lady lighter yet, O dear daughter nor son. 27 ‘There's an has been [put up] a big bauld fire, Anither ca'd in the stake, And on the head o yon high hill, They're to burn her for your sake.’ 28 ‘Gae saddle to me the black, the black, Gae saddle to me the brown; Gae saddle to me the swiftest steed, To hae me to the town.’ 29 Ere he was three miles near the town, She heard his horse-foot patt: ‘Mend up the fire, my fause brother, It scarce comes to my pap.’ 30 Ere he was twa miles near the town, She heard his bridle ring: ‘Mend up the fire, my fause brother, It scarce comes to my chin. 31 ‘But look about, my fause brother, Ye see not what I see; I see them coming here, or lang Will mend the fire for thee.’ 32 Then up it comes him little Prince James, And fiercely looked he: ‘I'se make my love's words very true She said concerning me. 33 ‘O wha has been sae bauld,’ he said, ‘As put this bonfire on? And wha has been sae bauld,’ he said, ‘As put that lady in?’ 34 Then out it spake her brother then, He spoke right furiouslie; Says, I'm the man that put her in: Wha dare hinder me? 35 ‘If my hands had been loose,’ she said, ‘As they are fastly bound, I woud hae looted me to the ground, Gien you up your bonny young son.’ 36 ‘I will burn, for my love's sake, Her father and her mother; And I will burn, for my love's sake, Her sister and her brother. 37 ‘And I will burn, for my love's sake, The whole o a' her kin; And I will burn, for my love's sake, Thro Linkum and thro Lin. 38 ‘And mony a bed will I make toom, And bower will I make thin; And mony a babe shall thole the fire, For I may enter in.’ 39 Great meen was made for Lady Maisry, On that hill whare she was slain; But mair was for her ain true-love, On the fields for he ran brain.

And I'll give him to his dowry Full fifty ploughs of land.’ 25 ‘I will not father my bairn on you, Nor on no wrongeous man, Though ye would give him to his dowry Five thousand ploughs of land.’ 26 Then up did start him Chiel Wyet, Shed by his yellow hair, And gave Lord Ingram to the heart A deep wound and a sair. 27 Then up did start him Lord Ingram, Shed by his yellow hair, And gave Chiel Wyet to the heart A deep wound and a sair. 28 There was no pity for that two lords, Where they were lying slain; But all was for her Lady Maisery, In that bower she gaed brain. 29 There was no pity for that two lords, When they were lying dead; But all was for her Lady Maisery, In that bower she went mad. 30 Said, Get to me a cloak of cloth, A staff of good hard tree; If I have been an evil woman, I shall beg till I dee. 31 ‘For a bit I'll beg for Chiel Wyet, For Lord Ingram I'll beg three; All for the good and honorable marriage At Mary Kirk he gave me.’ Lord Ingram and Gil Viett LORD INGRAM AND CHIEL WYET—B Skene MS., p. 16; taken down in the North of Scotland, 1802-1803. 1 Lord Ingram and Gil Viett Were baith born in ae ha; They laid their love on ae lady, An fate they coud na fa. 2 Lord Ingram and Gil Viett Were baith laid in ae wame; They laid their love on ae lady, The greater was their shame. 3 Lord Ingram wood her Lady Masery Frae father and frae mither; Gill Viett wood her Lady Masery Frae sister and frae brither. 4 Lord Ingram courted her Lady Masery Among the company a'; Gill Viett he wood her Lady Masery Among the sheets so sma. 5 ‘Get up, my daughter dear, Put on your bridal gown; This day's your bridal day Wi Lord Ingram.’ 6 ‘How can I get up, An put on my bridal gown, Or how marry the ae brither, An the tither's babe in my womb?’ 7 ‘O laugh you at mysell, brither, Or at my companie? Or laugh ye at my bonnie bride, She wad na laugh at thee?’ 8 ‘I laugh na at yoursel, brither, Nor at your companie; Nor laugh I at your buirlie bride, She wad na laugh at me. 9 ‘But there's a brotch on a breast-bane, A garlan on ane's hair; Gin ye kend what war under that, Ye wad neer love woman mair. 10 ‘There is a brotch on a breast-bane, An roses on ane's sheen; Gin ye kend what war under that, Your love wad soon be deen.’ 11 Whan bells were rung, and mass was sung, And a' man boun to bed, Lord Ingram and Lady Masery In ae chamer were laid. 12 He put his hand out oure his bonnie bride, The babe between her sides did quake: 13 ‘O father your babe on me, Lady Masery, O father your babe on me.’ 14 ‘I may father my babe on a stock, Sae may I on a stane, But my babe shall never hae A father but its ain.’ 15 He took out a brand, And laid it atween them twa; 16 Gill Viett took out a long brand, And stroakd it oer a stro, An thro and thro Lord Ingram's bodie He made it come and go. 17 ‘Wae mat worth ye, Gill Viett, An ill died mat ye die! For I had the cup in my hand To hae drunken her oer to thee.’ 18 ‘[For] ae mile [I wad gae] for Gil Viett, For Lord Ingram I wad hae gaen three; An a' for that in good kirk-door Fair wedding he gave me.’ 19 Gil Viett took a long brand, An stroakd it on a stro, An through and thro his own bodie He made it come and go. 20 There was nae mean made for that godd lords, In bowr whar they lay slain, But a' was for that lady, In bowr whar she gaed brain. 21 There was nae mean made for that lady, In bowr whar she lay dead, But a' was for the bonnie babe That lay blabbering in her bleed.

Or is my Maisdrey lighter yet A dear dochter or sun?’ 15 ‘Your ladie's faulds they are not brunt, Nor yet are her towrs wun, Neither is Maisdrey lighter yet A dear dochter or sun. 16 ‘But she bids ye and she prays ye baith, Gif ony prayer can dee, To Mary Kirk to cume the morn, Her weary wadding to see.’ 17 He dung the boord up wi his fit, Sae did he wi his tae; The silver cup that sat upon't I the fire he gard it flee: ‘O what na a lord in a' Scotland Dare marry my Maisdrey?’ 18 ‘O 't is but a feeble thought To tell the tane and not the tither; O 't is but a feeble thought To tell 't is your mither's brither.’ 19 ‘'Tis I wull send to that wadding, And I wul follow syne, The fitches o the fallow deer An the gammons o the swine, An the nine hides o the noble cow; 'Twas slain in season time. 20 ‘'Tis I wul send to that wadding Ten ton of the red wyne; Much more I'll send to that wadding, An I wul follow syne.’ 21 When he came in unto the ha, Lady Maisdrey she did ween, And twenty times he kist her mou Before Auld Ingram's een. 22 Nor to the kirk she wud ne gae, Nor til't she wudn ride, Till four and twunty men she gat her before, An twunty on ilka side, An four and twunty milk-white dows To flee aboon her head. 23 A loud laughter gae Lord Wayets Mang the mids o his men: ‘Marry the lady wham they weel, A maiden she is nane.’ 24 ‘O laugh ye at my men, Wayets? Or di ye laugh at me? Or laugh ye at the beerly bride, That's gane to marry me?’ 25 ‘I laugh na at your men, uncle, Nor yet dive I at thee, Bit I laugh at my lands sae braid, Sae weel's I do them see.’ 26 Whan ene was cume, and ene-bells rung, An a' man gane to bed, The bride bit and the silly bridegroom In chambers they were laid. 27 Was na it a fell thing for to see, Twa heads lye on a coad, Lady Maisdrey like the moten goud, Auld Ingram like a toad? 28 He turnd his face unto the stock, And sound he fell asleep; She turnd her fair face unto the wa, An sa't tears she did weep. 29 It fell about the mark midnight, Auld Ingram began to turn him; He pat his hands on's lady's sides, An waly, sair was she murnin. 30 ‘What aileth thee, my lady dear?

Or laugh ye at young Lady Maisry, This night my bride's to be?’ 23 ‘I laugh na at your men, brother, Nor do I laugh at thee; But I laugh at the knightless sport That I saw wi my ee. 24 ‘It is a ring on ae finger, A broach on ae breast-bane; And if ye kent what's under that, Your love woud soon be dane.’ 25 Lord Ingram and his merry young men Out ower the plains are gane, And pensively walkd him Childe Vyet, Him single self alane. 26 When they had eaten and well drunken, And a' men bound for bed, Lord Ingram and Lady Maisry In ae chamber were laid. 27 He laid his hand upon her breast, And thus pronounced he: ‘There is a bairn within your sides, Wha may the father be? 28 ‘Wha ever be your bairn's father, Ye will father it on me; The fairest castle o Snowdown Your morning gift shall be.’ 29 ‘Wha ever be my bairn's father, I'll neer father it on thee; For better love I my bairn's father Nor ever I'll love thee.’ 30 Then he's taen out a trusty brand, Laid it between them tway; Says, Lye ye there, ye ill woman, A maid for me till day. 31 Next morning her father came, Well belted wi a brand; Then up it starts him Lord Ingram, He was an angry man. 32 ‘If your daughter had been a gude woman, As I thought she had been, Cauld iron shoud hae never lien The lang night us between.’ 33 ‘Ohon, alas! my daughter dear, What's this I hear o thee? I thought ye was a gude woman As in the north countrie.’ 34 ‘O had your tongue, my father dear, Let a' your sorrows be; I never liked Lord Ingram, Ye ken ye forced me.’ 35 Then in it came him Childe Vyet, Well belted wi a brand; Then up it raise him Lord Ingram, He was an angry man. 36 ‘Win up, win up, now Lord Ingram, Rise up immediately, That you and I the quarrel try, Who gains the victory. 37 ‘I hae twa brands in ae scabbard, That cost me mony pound; Take ye the best, gie me the warst, And I'll fight where I stand.’ 38 Then up it starts him Childe Vyet, Shook back his yellow hair; The first an stroke Childe Vyet drew, He wounded Ingram sair. 39 Then up it starts him Lord Ingram, Shed back his coal-black hair; The first an stroke Lord Ingram drew, Childe Vyet needed nae mair. 40 Nae meen was made for these twa knights, Whan they were lying dead, But a' for her Lady Maisry, That gaes in mournfu weed. 41 Says, ‘If I hae been an ill woman, Alas and wae is me! And if I've been an ill woman, A gude woman I'll be! 42 ‘Ye'll take frae me my silk attire, Bring me a palmer's weed, And thro the world, for their sakes, I'll gang and beg my bread. 43 ‘If I gang a step for Childe Vyet, For Lord Ingram I'll gang three; All for the honour that he paid At Marykirk to me. 44 ‘I'll gang a step for Childe Vyet, For Lord Ingram I'll gang three; It was into my mother's bower Childe Vyet wronged me.’ 67 GLASGERION Glasgerion GLASGERION—A Percy MS., p. 94; Hales and Furnivall, I, 248. 1 Glasgerion was a kings owne sonne, And a harper he was good; He harped in the kings chamber, Where cuppe and candle stoode, And soe did hee in the queens chamber, Till ladies waxed wood. 2 And then bespake the kings daughter, And these words thus sayd shee: 3 Saide, Strike on, strike on, Glasgerrion, Of thy striking doe not blinne; There's neuer a stroke comes ouer thin harpe But it glads my hart within. 4 ‘Faire might you fall, lady!’ quoth hee; ‘Who taught you now to speake? I haue loued you, lady, seuen yeere; My hart I durst neere breake.’ 5 ‘But come to my bower, my Glasgerryon, When all men are att rest; As I am a ladie true of my promise, Thou shalt bee a welcome guest.’ 6 But hom then came Glasgerryon, A glad man, Lord, was hee: ‘And come thou hither, Iacke, my boy, Come hither vnto mee. 7 ‘For the kings daughter of Normandye, Her loue is granted mee, And beffore the cocke haue crowen, Att her chamber must I bee.’ 8 ‘But come you hither master,’ quoth hee, ‘Lay your head downe on this stone; For I will waken you, master deere, Afore it be time to gone.’ 9 But vpp then rose that lither ladd, And did on hose and shoone; A coller he cast vpon his necke, Hee seemed a gentleman. 10 And when he came to that ladies chamber, He thrild vpon a pinn; The lady was true of her promise, Rose vp and lett him in. 11 He did not take the lady gay To boulster nor to bedd, But downe vpon her chamber-flore Full soone he hath her layd. 12 He did not kisse that lady gay When he came nor when he youd; And sore mistrusted that lady gay He was of some churlës blood. 13 But home then came that lither ladd, And did of his hose and shoone, And cast that coller from about his necke; He was but a churlës sonne: ‘Awaken,’ quoth hee, ‘my master deere, I hold it time to be gone. 14 ‘For I haue sadled your horsse, master, Well bridled I haue your steed; Haue not I serued a good breakfast, When time comes I haue need.’ 15 But vp then rose good Glasgerryon, And did on both hose and shoone, And cast a coller about his necke; He was a kingës sonne. 16 And when he came to that ladies chamber, He thrild vpon a pinn; The lady was more then true of promise, Rose vp and let him in. 17 Saies, Whether haue you left with me Your braclett or your gloue? Or are you returned backe againe To know more of my loue?’ 18 Glasgerryon swore a full great othe, By oake and ashe and thorne, ‘Lady, I was neuer in your chamber Sith the time that I was borne.’ 19 ‘O then it was your litle foote-page Falsly hath beguiled me:’ And then shee pulld forth a litle pen-kniffe, That hanged by her knee, Says, There shall neuer noe churlës blood Spring within my body. 20 But home then went Glasgerryon, A woe man, good [Lord], was hee; Sayes, Come hither, thou Iacke, my boy, Come thou hither to me. 21 Ffor if I had killed a man to-night, Iacke, I wold tell it thee; But if I haue not killed a man to-night, Iacke, thou hast killed three! 22 And he puld out his bright browne sword, And dryed it on his sleeue, And he smote off that lither ladds head, And asked noe man noe leaue. 23 He sett the swords poynt till his brest, The pumill till a stone; Thorrow that falsenese of that lither ladd These three liues werne all gone. Glenkindie GLASGERION—B Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 93, taken from the recitation of an old woman by Professor Scott, of Aberdeen, and “somewhat improved” by a fragment communicated by the Rev. William Gray, of Lincoln. 1 Glenkindie was ance a harper gude, He harped to the king; And Glenkindie was ance the best harper That ever harpd on a string. 2 He'd harpit a fish out o saut water, Or water out o a stane, Or milk out o a maiden's breast, That bairn had never nane. 3 He's taen his harp intil his hand, He harpit and he sang, And ay as he harpit to the king, To haud him unthought lang. 4 ‘I'll gie you a robe, Glenkindie, A robe o the royal pa, Gin ye will harp i the winter's night Afore my nobles a'.’ 5 He's taen his harp intill his hand, He's harpit them a' asleep, Except it was the young countess, That love did waukin keep. 6 And first he has harpit a grave tune, And syne he has harpit a gay, And mony a sich atween hands I wat the lady gae. 7 Says, Whan day is dawen, and cocks hae crawen, And wappit their wings sae wide, It's ye may come to my bower-door, And streek you by my side. 8 But look that ye tell na Gib, your man, For naething that ye dee; For, an ye tell him Gib, your man, He'll beguile baith you and me. 9 He's taen his harp intill his hand, He harpit and he sang, And he is hame to Gib, his man, As fast as he could gang. 10 ‘O mith I tell you, Gib, my man, Gin I a man had slain?’ ‘O that ye micht, my gude master, Altho ye had slain ten.’ 11 ‘Then tak ye tent now, Gib, my man, My bidden for to dee; And but an ye wauken me in time, Ye sall be hangit hie. 12 ‘Whan day has dawen, and cocks hae crawen, And wappit their wings sae wide, I'm bidden gang till yon lady's bower, And streek me by her side.’ 13 ‘Gae hame to your bed, my good master; Ye've waukit, I fear, oer lang; For I'll wauken you in as good time As ony cock i the land.’ 14 He's taen his harp intill his hand, He harpit and he sang, Until he harpit his master asleep, Syne fast awa did gang. 15 And he is till that lady's bower, As fast as he could rin; When he cam till that lady's bower, He chappit at the chin. 16 ‘O wha is this,’ says that lady, ‘That opens nae and comes in?’ ‘It's I, Glenkindie, your ain true-love, O open and lat me in!’ 17 She kent he was nae gentle knicht That she had latten in, For neither when he gaed nor cam, Kist he her cheek or chin. 18 He neither kist her when he cam, Nor clappit her when he gaed, And in and at her bower window, The moon shone like the gleed. 19 ‘O ragged is your hose, Glenkindie, And riven is your sheen, And reaveld is your yellow hair, That I saw late yestreen.’ 20 ‘The stockings they are Gib, my man's, They came first to my hand, And this is Gib, my man's shoon, At my bed-feet they stand; I've reavelld a' my yellow hair Coming against the wind.’ 21 He's taen the harp intill his hand, He harpit and he sang, Until he cam to his master, As fast as he could gang. 22 ‘Won up, won up, my good master, I fear ye sleep oer lang; There's nae a cock in a' the land But has wappit his wings and crawn.’ 23 Glenkindie's tane his harp in hand, He harpit and he sang, And he has reachd the lady's bower Afore that eer he blan. 24 When he cam to the lady's bower, He chappit at the chin: ‘O wha is that at my bower-door, That opens na and comes in?’ ‘It's I, Glenkindie, your ain true-love, And in I canna win.’ 25 ‘Forbid it, forbid it,’ says that lady, ‘That ever sic shame betide, That I should first be a wild loon's lass, And than a young knight's bride.’ 26 He's taen his harp intill his hand, He harpit and he sang, And he is hame to Gib, his man, As fast as he could gang. 27 ‘Come forth, come forth, now, Gib, my man, Till I pay you your fee; Come forth, come forth, now, Gib, my man, Weel payit sall ye be.’ 28 And he has taen him Gib, his man, And he has hangd him hie, And he's hangit him oer his ain yate, As high as high could be. 29 There was nae pity for that lady, For she lay cald and dead, But a' was for him, Glenkindie, In bower he must go mad. GLASGERION—C Kinloch's MSS, III, 139, in the handwriting of John Hill Burton. 1 Glenkinnie was as good a harper As ever harpet tone; He harpet fish out o the sea-flood, And water out of a dry loan, And milk out o the maiden's breast That bairn had never neen. 2 He harpit i the king's palace, He harpit them a' asleep, Unless it were Burd Bell alone, And she stud on her feet. 3 ‘Ye will do ye home, Glenkinnie, And ye will take a sleep, And ye will come to my bower-door Before the cock's crowing.’ 4 He's taen out his milk-white steed, And fast away rode he, Till he came to his ain castle, Where gold glanced never so hie. 5 ‘Might I tell ye, Jeck, my man, Gin I had slain a man?’ ‘Deed might [ye], my good master, Altho ye had slain ten.’ 6 ‘I've faun in love wi a gay ladie, She's daughter to the Queen, And I maun be at her bower-door Before the cock's crowing.’ 7 He's taen out his master's steed, And fast awa rode he, Until he cam to Burd Bell's door, Where gold glanced never so hie. 8 When he came to Burd Bell's door, He tirled at the pin, And up she rose, away she goes, To let Glenkinnie in. 9 That I combed out yestreen. 10 She looked out at a shot-window, Atween her and the meen: ‘There is twa lovers beguiled the night, And I fear I am ane. 11 ‘Ye shall na hae to say, Glenkindie, When you sit at the wine, That once you loved a queen's daughter, And she was your footman's quean.’ 68 YOUNG HUNTING Young Hunting YOUNG HUNTING—A a. Herd's MSS, I, 182; b. the same, II, 67. 1 O lady, rock never your young son young One hour longer for me, For I have a sweetheart in Garlick's Wells I love thrice better than thee. 2 ‘The very sols of my love's feet Is whiter then thy face:’ ‘But nevertheless na, Young Hunting, Ye'l stay wi me all night.’ 3 She has birld in him Young Hunting The good ale and the beer, Till he was as fou drunken As any wild-wood steer. 4 She has birld in him Young Hunting The good ale and the wine, Till he was as fou drunken As any wild-wood swine. 5 Up she has tain him Young Hunting, And she has had him to her bed, 6 And she has minded her on a little penknife, That hangs low down by her gare, And she has gin him Young Hunting A deep wound and a sare. 7 Out an spake the bonny bird, That flew abon her head: ‘Lady, keep well thy green clothing Fra that good lord's blood.’ 8 ‘O better I'll keep my green clothing Fra that good lord's blood Nor thou can keep thy flattering toung, That flatters in thy head. 9 ‘Light down, light down, my bonny bird, Light down upon my hand, 10 ‘O siller, O siller shall be thy hire, An goud shall be thy fee, An every month into the year Thy cage shall changed be.’ 11 ‘I winna light down, I shanna light down, I winna light on thy hand; For soon, soon wad ye do to me As ye done to Young Hunting.’ 12 She has booted an spird him Young Hunting As he had been gan to ride, A hunting-horn about his neck, An the sharp sourd by his side. 13 And she has had him to yon wan water, For a' man calls it Clyde, 14 The deepest pot intill it all She has puten Young Hunting in; A green truff upon his breast, To hold that good lord down. 15 It fell once upon a day The king was going to ride, And he sent for him Young Hunting, To ride on his right side. 16 She has turnd her right and round about, She sware now by the corn, ‘I saw na thy son, Young Hunting, Sen yesterday at morn.’ 17 She has turnd her right and round about, She swear now by the moon, ‘I saw na thy son, Young Hunting, Sen yesterday at noon. 18 ‘It fears me sair in Clyde Water That he is drownd therein:’ O thay ha sent for the king's duckers, To duck for Young Hunting. 19 They ducked in at the tae water-bank, Thay ducked out at the tither: ‘We'll duck no more for Young Hunting, All tho he wear our brother.’ 20 Out an spake the bonny bird, That flew abon their heads, 21 ‘O he's na drownd in Clyde Water, He is slain and put therein; The lady that lives in yon castil Slew him and put him in. 22 ‘Leave aff your ducking on the day, And duck upon the night; Whear ever that sakeless knight lys slain, The candels will shine bright.’ 23 Thay left off their ducking o the day, And ducked upon the night, And where that sakeless knight lay slain, The candles shone full bright. 24 The deepest pot intill it a' Thay got Young Hunting in; A green turff upon his brest, To hold that good lord down. 25 O thay ha sent aff men to the wood To hew down baith thorn an fern, That they might get a great bonefire To burn that lady in. ‘Put na the wyte on me,’ she says, ‘It was her May Catheren.’ 26 Whan thay had tane her May Catheren, In the bonefire set her in; It wad na take upon her cheeks, Nor take upon her chin, Nor yet upon her yallow hair, To healle the deadly sin. 27 Out they hae tain her May Catheren, And they hay put that lady in; O it took upon her cheek, her cheek, An it took upon her chin, An it took on her fair body, She burnt like hoky-gren. Young Redin YOUNG HUNTING—B Kinloch MSS, VII, p. 7, Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 1; “from the recitation of Miss E. Beattie, of Edinburgh, a native of Mearns-shire, who sings it to a plaintive and melancholy, though somewhat monotonous, air of one measure.” 1 Young Redin's til the huntin gane, Wi therty lords and three; And he has til his true-love gane, As fast as he could hie. 2 ‘Ye're welcome here, my Young Redin, For coal and candle-licht; And sae are ye, my Young Redin, To bide wi me the nicht.’ 3 ‘I thank ye for your licht, ladie, Sae do I for your coal; But there's thrice as fair a ladie as thee Meets me at Brandie's Well.’ 4 Whan they war at their supper set, And merrily drinking wine, This ladie has tane a sair sickness, And til her bed has gane. 5 Young Redin he has followed her, And a dowie man was he; He fund his true-love in her bouer, And the tear was in her ee. 6 Whan he was in her arms laid, And gieing her kisses sweet, Then out she's tane a little penknife, And woundid him sae deep. 7 ‘O lang, lang is the winter nicht, And slawly daws the day; There is a slain knicht in my bouer, And I wish he war away.’ 8 Then up bespak her bouer-woman, And she spak ae wi spite: ‘An there be a slain knicht in your bouer, It's yoursell that has the wyte.’ 9 ‘O heal this deed on me, Meggy, O heal this deed on me; The silks that war shapen for me gen Pasche, They sall be sewed for thee.’ 10 ‘O I hae heald on my mistress A twalmonth and a day, And I hae heald on my mistress Mair than I can say.’ 11 They've booted him, and they've spurred him, As he was wont to ride, A huntin-horn round his neck, And a sharp sword by his side; In the deepest place o Clyde's Water, It's there they've made his bed. 12 Sine up bespak the wylie parrot, As he sat on the tree: ‘And hae ye killd him Young Redin, Wha neer had love but thee?’ 13 ‘Come doun, come doun, ye wylie parrot, Come doun into my hand; Your cage sall be o the beaten gowd, Whan now it's but the wand.’ 14 ‘I winna come doun, I canna come doun, I winna come doun to thee; For as ye've dune to Young Redin, Ye'll do the like to me; Ye'll thraw my head aff my hause-bane, And throw me in the sea.’ 15 O there cam seekin Young Redin Mony a lord and knicht, And there cam seekin Young Redin Mony a ladie bricht. 16 And they've til his true-love gane, Thinking he was wi her; 17 ‘I hae na seen him Young Redin Sin yesterday at noon; He turnd his stately steed about, And hied him throw the toun. 18 ‘But ye'll seek Clyde's Water up and doun, Ye'll seek it out and in; I hae na seen him Young Redin Sin yesterday at noon.’ 19 Then up bespak Young Redin's mither, And a dowie woman was scho: ‘There's na a place in Clyde's Water But my son wad gae throw.’ 20 They've sought Clyde's Water up and doun, They've sought it out and in, And the deepest place in Clyde's Water They've fund Young Redin in. 21 O white, white war his wounds washen, As white as a linen clout; But as the traitor she cam near, His wounds they gushit out. 22 ‘It's surely been my bouer-woman, O ill may her betide! I neer wad slain him Young Redin, And thrown him in the Clyde.’ 23 Then they've made a big bane-fire, The bouer-woman to brin; It tuke not on her cheek, her cheek, It tuke not on her chin, But it tuke on the cruel hands That pat Young Redin in. 24 Then they've tane out the bouer-woman, And pat the ladie in; It tuke na on her cheek, her cheek, It tuke na on her chin, But it tuke on the fause, fause arms That Young Redin lay in. Young Riedan YOUNG HUNTING—C Harris MS., fol. 8, from Mrs Harris, Perthshire. 1 The ladie stude in her bour-door, In her bour-door as she stude, She thocht she heard a bridle ring, That did her bodie gude. 2 She thocht it had been her father dear, Come ridin owre the sand; But it was her true-love Riedan, Come hiean to her hand. 3 ‘You're welcome, you're welcome, Young Riedan,’ she said, ‘To coal an cannel-licht; You're welcome, you're welcome, Young Riedan, To sleep in my bour this nicht.’ 4 ‘I thank you for your coal, madame, An for your cannel tae; There's a fairer maid at Clyde's Water, I love better than you.’ 5 ‘A fairer maid than me, Riedan? A fairer maid than me? A fairer maid than ten o me You shurely neer did see.’ 6 He leant him owre his saddle-bow, To gie her a kiss sae sweet; She keppit him on a little penknife, An gae him a wound sae deep. 7 ‘Oh hide! oh hide! my bourswoman, Oh hide this deed on me! An the silks that waur shappit for me at Yule At Pasch sall be sewed for thee.’ 8 They saidled Young Riedan, they bridled Young Riedan, The way he was wont to ride; Wi a huntin-horn aboot his neck, An a sharp sword by his side. 9 An they are on to Clyde's Water, An they rade it up an doon, An the deepest linn in a' Clyde's Water They flang him Young Riedan [in]. 10 ‘Lie you there, you Young Riedan, Your bed it is fu wan; The [maid] you hae at Clyde's Water, For you she will think lang.’ 11 Up it spak the wily bird, As it sat on the tree: ‘Oh wae betide you, ill woman, An an ill death may you dee! For he had neer anither love, Anither love but thee.’ 12 ‘Come doon, come doon, my pretty parrot, An pickle wheat aff my glue; An your cage sall be o the beaten goud, Whan it's of the willow tree.’ 13 ‘I winna come doon, I sanna come doon, To siccan a traitor as thee; For as you did to Young Riedan, Sae wald you do to mee.’ 14 Come doon, come doon, my pretty parrot, An pickle wheat aff my hand; An your cage sall be o the beaten goud, Whan it's o the willow wand.’ 15 ‘I winna come doon, I sanna come doon, To siccan a traitor as thee; You wald thraw my head aff my hase-bane, An fling it in the sea.’ 16 It fell upon a Lammas-tide The king's court cam ridin bye: ‘Oh whare is it him Young Riedan? It's fain I wald him see.’ 17 ‘Oh I hae no seen Young Riedan Sin three lang weeks the morn; It bodes me sair, and drieds me mair, Clyde's Water's him forlorn.’ 18 Up it spak the wily bird, As it sat on the tree; 19 ‘Leave aff, leave aff your day-seekin, An ye maun seek by nicht; Aboon the place Young Riedan lies, The cannels burn bricht.’ 20 They gae up their day-seekin, An they did seek by nicht; An owre the place Young Riedan lay, The cannels burnt bricht. 21 The firsten grip his mother got Was o his yellow hair; An was na that a dowie grip, To get her ae son there! 22 The nexten grip his mother got Was o his milk-white hand; An wasna that a dowie grip, To bring sae far to land! 23 White, white waur his wounds washen, As white as ony lawn; But sune's the traitor stude afore, Then oot the red blude sprang. 24 Fire wadna tak on her bourswoman, Niether on cheek nor chin; But it took fast on thae twa hands That flang young Riedan in. 25 ‘Come oot, come oot, my bourswoman, Come oot, lat me win in; For as I did the deed mysell, Sae man I drie the pine.’ YOUNG HUNTING—D Motherwell's MS., p. 377; from Agnes Lyle, Kilbarchan. 1 Earl Richard has a hunting gone, As fast as he can ride; He's a hunting-horn about his neck, And a broadsword by his side. 2 ‘Licht down, licht down, Earl Richard,’ she says, ‘O licht down and come in, And thou'll get cheer and charcoal clear, And torches for to burn.’ 3 ‘I winna licht, I canna licht, I winna licht at all; A fairer lady then ten of thee Meets me at Richard's Wall.’ 4 He louted owre his saddle-bow, And for to kiss her sweet, But little thocht o that penknife Wherewith she wound him deep. 5 ‘Why wounds thou me so deep, lady? Why stabs thou me so sore? There's not a lord like Earl Richard Could love false woman more.’ 6 She called upon her waiting-maid, Long before it was day: ‘I have a dead man in my bower, I wish he were away.’ 7 ‘Keep ye your bower, my lily-flower, Keep it free of all men's blood;’ ‘Oh I will keep it een as weel As you or any maid. 8 ‘But siller will be thy wage,’ she says, ‘And gold will be thy fee, And I mysell will gang alang And bear thee companye.’ 9 They booted him, and spurred him, As he was wont to ride, And they're awa to Lorn's Water, To Lorn's Water so wide. 10 They turned down his yellow hair, Turnd up his milk-white feet: ‘Lye thou there, Earl Richard,’ she said, ‘Till the blood seep from thy bane; That fairer maid than ten of me Will look lang or thou come hame.’ 11 As they were coming hame again, Upon the road so hie, There they spy'd a small pyet, Was sitting on a tree. 12 ‘Where has thou been, fair lady?’ it says, ‘Whare has thou been so soon? Or what did thou wi Earl Richard, Was late wi thee yestreen?’ 13 ‘Come down, come down, my wee pyet; An thou'll come to my knee, I have a cage of beaten gold, And I'll bestow't on thee.’ 14 ‘Keep thou thy cage of beaten gold, And I will keep my tree; For as thou did wi Earl Richard, So wad thou do wi me; Thou wad thraw the wee head aff my bouk, And drown me in the sea.’ 15 ‘Come down, come down, my wee pyet; An thou'll come to my hand, I have a cage of beaten gold, And thou's be put therein.’ 16 ‘Keep thou thy cage o beaten gold, And I will keep my tree; For as thou did wi Earl Richard, So would thou do wi me.’ 17 ‘Oh an I had my bow bendit, And set unto my knee, I wad shoot this wee pyet Sits gabbing on the tree.’ 18 ‘Before thou get thy bow bendit, And set unto thy knee, I'll be at Earl Richard's father, Telling ill tales on thee.’ 19 As they were coming hame again, Upon the road so bricht, There they saw Earl Richard's father, Coming marching in their sicht. 20 ‘Whare has thou been, fair lady?’ he says, ‘Whare has thou been back sae sune? O what did thou wi my auld son, Was late wi thee yestreen?’ 21 She did swear by stars o licht, And grass-green growing corn, That she had not seen Earl Richard's face Since Saturday at morn; ‘But in Lorn's Water, indeed,’ she says, ‘I fear his days are done.’ 22 ‘There was not a ford in Lorn's Water But he could ride it weel; And what did thou wi my auld son, That went with thee afield?’ Lord William YOUNG HUNTING—E Scott's Minstrelsy, III, 265, 1803, communicated by James Hogg, from the recitation of his mother (Motherwell). 1 Lord William was the bravest knight That dwalt in fair Scotland, And, though renowned in France and Spain, Fell by a ladie's hand. 2 As she was walking maid alone, Down by yon shady wood, She heard a smit o bridle reins, She wishd might be for good. 3 ‘Come to my arms, my dear Willie, You're welcome hame to me; To best o chear and charcoal red, And candle burnin free.’ 4 ‘I winna light, I darena light, Nor come to your arms at a'; A fairer maid than ten o you I'll meet at Castle-law.’ 5 ‘A fairer maid than me, Willie? A fairer maid than me? A fairer maid than ten o me Your eyes did never see.’ 6 He louted owr his saddle-lap To kiss her ere they part, And wi a little keen bodkin, She pierced him to the heart. 7 ‘Ride on, ride on, Lord William now, As fast as ye can dree; Your bonny lass at Castle-law Will weary you to see.’ 8 Out up then spake a bonny bird, Sat high upon a tree: ‘How could you kill that noble lord? He came to marry thee.’ 9 ‘Come down, come down, my bonny bird, And eat bread aff my hand; Your cage shall be of wiry goud, Whar now it's but the wand.’ 10 ‘Keep ye your cage o goud, lady, And I will keep my tree; As ye hae done to Lord William, Sae wad ye do to me.’ 11 She set her foot on her door-step, A bonny marble stane, And carried him to her chamber, Oer him to make her mane. 12 And she has kept that good lord's corpse Three quarters of a year, Until that word began to spread; Then she began to fear. 13 Then she cryed on her waiting-maid, Ay ready at her ca: ‘There is a knight into my bower, 'Tis time he were awa.’ 14 The ane has taen him by the head, The ither by the feet, And thrown him in the wan water, That ran baith wide and deep. 15 ‘Look back, look back, now, lady fair, On him that loed ye weel; A better man than that blue corpse Neer drew a sword of steel.’ Earl Richard YOUNG HUNTING—F a.

Motherwell's Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. xvii, VIII, one stanza. 1 Earl Richard is a hunting gone, As fast as he can ride, His hunting-horn hung about his neck, And a small sword by his side. 2 When he came to my lady's gate He tirled at the pin, And wha was sae ready as the lady hersell To open and let him in. 3 ‘O light, O light, Earl Richard,’ she says, ‘O light and stay a' night; You shall have cheer wi charcoal clear, And candles burning bright.’ 4 ‘I will not light, I cannot light, I cannot light at all; A fairer lady than ten of thee Is waiting at Richard's Wall.’ 5 He stooped from his milk-white steed, To kiss her rosy cheek; She had a pen-knife in her hand, And wounded him so deep. 6 ‘O lie ye there, Earl Richard,’ she says, ‘O lie ye there till morn; A fairer lady than ten of me Will think lang of your coming home.’ 7 She called her servants ane by ane, She called them twa by twa: ‘I have got a dead man in my bower, I wish he were awa.’ 8 The one has taen [him] by the hand, And the other by the feet, And they've thrown him in a deep draw-well, Full fifty fathom deep. 9 Then up bespake a little bird, That sat upon a tree: ‘Gae hame, gae hame, ye false lady, And pay your maids their fee.’ 10 ‘Come down, come down, my pretty bird, That sits upon the tree; I have a cage of beaten gold, I'll gie it unto thee.’ 11 ‘Gae hame, gae hame, ye fause lady, And pay your maids their fee; As ye have done to Earl Richard, Sae wud ye do to me.’ 12 ‘If I had an arrow in my hand, And a bow bent on a string, I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart, Amang the leaves sae green.’ YOUNG HUNTING—G Herd's MSS, I, 34; Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 148. 1 She has calld to her her bower-maidens, She has calld them one by one: ‘There is a dead man in my bower, I wish that he was gone.’ 2 They have booted him, and spurred him, As he was wont to ride, A hunting-horn around his waist, A sharp sword by his side. 3 Then up and spake a bonie bird, That sat upon the tree: ‘What hae ye done wi Earl Richard? Ye was his gay lady.’ 4 ‘Cum down, cum down, my bonie bird, Cum sit upon my hand; And ye sall hae a cage o the gowd, Where ye hae but the wand.’ 5 ‘Awa, awa, ye ill woman, Nae ill woman for me; What ye hae done to Earl Richard, Sae wad ye do to mee.’ 6 ‘O there's a bird intill your bowir That sings sae sad and sweet; O there's a bird intill your bour Kept me frae my nicht's sleep.’ 7 And she sware by the grass sae greene, Sae did she by the corn, That she had not seen Earl Richard Sen yesterday at morn. Clyde's Water YOUNG HUNTING—H Dr Joseph Robertson's “Journal of Excursions,” No 1, 1829. 1 ‘Hail well, hail well, my little foot-page, Hail well this deed on me, And ever I live my life to brook, I'se pay thee well thy fee.’ 2 ‘It's we'l beet him, and we'l spur him, As gin he had been gain to ride, Put a huntin-horn about his neck, And a small sword by his side. 3 ‘And we'll carry him to Clyde's Water, And there we'll fling him in, That we may have it to be said In Clyde's Water he drownd.’ 4 O they bet him, and they spurrd him, As gin he had been gain to ride, Pat a huntin-horn about his neck, But the sword on his wrang side. 5 And they hae carried him to Clyde's Water, And there they flang him in, That they might have it to be said In Clyde's Water he drowned. 6 ‘It's we'll sen for the king's doukers, And douk it up and doun; It's we'll sen for the king's doukers, And douk it out and in.’ 7 Out it spak a little wee birdie, As it sat on yon burn-brae: 8 ‘Ye may lay by your day doukers, And turn you to the night, And where the innocent blood lies slain, The candles will burn fou bricht.’ 9 O they hae brunt that gay ladie, And blawn her in the air, And nothing o that bower-man would burn But the hands that buskd him rare. Lord John YOUNG HUNTING—I Motherwell MS., p. 189. 1 ‘Come down, come down, thou bonnie bird, Sit low upon my hand, And thy cage shall be o the beaten gowd, And not of hazel wand.’ 2 ‘O woe, O woe be to thee, lady, And an ill death may thou die! For the way thou guided good Lord John, Soon, soon would thou guide me.’ 3 ‘Go bend to me my bow,’ she said, ‘And set it to my ee, And I will gar that bonnie bird Come quickly down to me.’ 4 ‘Before thou bend thy bow, lady, And set it to thy ee, O I will be at yon far forest, Telling ill tales on thee.’ Earl Richard YOUNG HUNTING—J Scott's Minstrelsy, II, 42, 1802, and III, 184, 1833, from Herd's copies (A, G), and from tradition. 1 ‘O lady, rock never your young son young One hour langer for me; For I have a sweetheart in Garlioch Wells I love far better than thee. 2 ‘The very sole o that ladye's foot Than thy face is far mair white:’ ‘But, nevertheless, now, Erl Richard, Ye will bide in my bower a' night?’ 3 She birled him wi the ale and wine, As they sat down to sup: A living man he laid him down, But I wot he neer rose up. 4 Then up and spake the popinjay, That flew aboun her head: ‘Lady, keep weel your green cleiding Frae gude Erl Richard's bleid.’ 5 ‘O better I'll keep my green cleiding Frae gude Erl Richard's bleid, Than thou canst keep thy clattering toung, That trattles in thy head.’ 6 She has calld upon her bower-maidens, She has calld them ane by ane: ‘There lies a deid man in my bowr, I wish that he were gane.’ 7 They hae booted him, and spurred him, As he was wont to ride, A hunting-horn tied round his waist, A sharp sword by his side; And they hae had him to the wan water, For a' men call it Clyde. 8 Then up and spake the popinjay, That sat upon the tree: ‘What hae ye done wi Erl Richard? Ye were his gaye ladye.’ 9 ‘Come down, come down, my bonny bird, And sit upon my hand; And thou sall hae a cage o gowd, Where thou hast but the wand.’ 10 ‘Awa, awa, ye ill woman, Nae cage o gowd for me; As ye hae dune to Erl Richard, Sae wad ye do to me.’ 11 She hadna crossd a rigg o land, A rigg but barely ane, When she met wi his auld father, Came riding all alane. 12 ‘Where hae ye been, now, ladye fair, Where hae ye been sae late? We hae been seeking Erl Richard, But him we canna get.’ 13 ‘Erl Richard kens a' the fords in Clyde, He'll ride them ane by ane; And though the night was neer sae mirk, Erl Richard will be hame.’ 14 O it fell anes upon a day The king was boun to ride, And he has mist him Erl Richard, Should hae ridden on his right side. 15 The ladye turnd her round about, Wi mickle mournfu din: ‘It fears me sair o Clyde water, That he is drownd therein.’ 16 ‘Gar douk, gar douk,’ the king he cried, ‘Gar douk for gold and fee; O wha will douk for Erl Richard's sake, Or wha will douk for me?’ 17 They douked in at ae weil-heid, And out aye at the other: ‘We can douk nae mair for Erl Richard, Altho he were our brother.’ 18 It fell that in that ladye's castle The king was boun to bed, And up and spake the popinjay, That flew abune his head. 19 ‘Leave aff your douking on the day, And douk upon the night; And wherever that sackless knight lies slain, The candles will burn bright.’ 20 ‘O there's a bird within this bower, That sings baith sad and sweet; O there's a bird within your bower Keeps me frae my night's sleep.’ 21 They left the douking on the day, And douked upon the night, And where that sackless knight lay slain, The candles burned bright. 22 The deepest pot in a' the linn They fand Erl Richard in; A green turf tyed across his breast, To keep that gude lord down. 23 Then up and spake the king himsell, When he saw the deadly wound, ‘O wha has slain my right-hand man, That held my hawk and hound?’ 24 Then up and spake the popinjay, Says, What needs a' this din? It was his light lemman took his life, And hided him in the linn. 25 She swore her by the grass sae grene, Sae did she by the corn, She had na seen him Erl Richard Since Moninday at morn. 26 ‘Put na the wyte on me,’ she said, ‘It was my may, Catherine:’ Then they hae cut baith fern and thorn, To burn that maiden in. 27 It wadna take upon her cheik, Nor yet upon her chin, Nor yet upon her yellow hair, To cleanse the deadly sin. 28 The maiden touchd the clay-cauld corpse, A drap it never bled; The ladye laid her hand on him, And soon the ground was red. 29 Out they hae ta'en her May Catherine, And put her mistress in; The flame tuik fast upon her cheik, Tuik fast upon her chin, Tuik fast upon her fair bodye, She burnd like hollins grene. Young Hunting YOUNG HUNTING—K Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 118. 1 Lady Maisry forth from her bower came, And stood on her tower-head; She thought she heard a bridle ring, The sound did her heart guid. 2 She thought it was her first true-love, Whom she loved ance in time; But it was her new love, Hunting, Come frae the hunting o the hyn. 3 ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow, Lady Maisry, God make you safe and free; I'm come to take my last farewell, And pay my last visit to thee.’ 4 ‘O stay, O stay then, Young Hunting, O stay with me this night; Ye shall hae cheer, an charcoal clear, And candles burning bright.’ 5 ‘Have no more cheer, you lady fair, An hour langer for me; I have a lady in Garmouth town I love better than thee.’ 6 ‘O if your love be changed, my love, Since better canno be, Nevertheless, for auld lang syne, Ye'll stay this night wi me. 7 ‘Silver, silver shall be your wage, And gowd shall be your fee, And nine times nine into the year Your weed shall changed be. 8 ‘Will ye gae to the cards or dice, Or to a tavern fine? Or will ye gae to a table forebye, And birl baith beer and wine?’ 9 ‘I winna gang to the cards nor dice, Nor to a tavern fine; But I will gang to a table forebye, And birl baith beer and wine.’ 10 Then she has drawn for Young Hunting The beer but and the wine, Till she got him as deadly drunk As ony unhallowed swine. 11 Then she's taen out a trusty brand, That hang below her gare, Then she's wounded him Young Hunting, A deep wound and a sair. 12 Then out it speaks her comrade, Being in the companie: ‘Alas! this deed that ye hae done Will ruin baith you and me.’ 13 ‘Heal well, heal well, you Lady Katharine, Heal well this deed on me, The robes that were shapen for my bodie, They shall be sewed for thee.’ 14 ‘Tho I woud heal it never sae well, And never sae well,’ said she, ‘There is a God above us baith That can baith hear and see.’ 15 They booted him, and spurred him, As he'd been gaun to ride, A hunting-horn about his neck, A sharp sword by his side. 16 And they rode on, and farther on, All the lang summer's tide, Until they came to wan water, Where a' man ca's it Clyde. 17 And the deepest pot in Clyde's water, And there they flang him in, And put a turf on his breast-bane, To had Young Hunting down. 18 O out it speaks a little wee bird, As she sat on the brier: ‘Gae hame, gae hame, ye Lady Maisry, And pay your maiden's hire.’ 19 ‘O I will pay my maiden's hire, And hire I'll gie to thee; If ye'll conceal this fatal deed, Ye's hae gowd for your fee.’ 20 Then out it speaks a bonny bird, That flew aboon their head: ‘Keep well, keep well your green claithing Frae ae drap o his bluid.’ 21 ‘O I'll keep well my green claithing Frae ae drop o his bluid, Better than I'll do your flattering tongue, That flutters in your head. 22 ‘Come down, come down, my bonny bird, Light down upon my hand; For ae gowd feather that's in your wing, I woud gie a' my land.’ 23 ‘How shall I come down, how can I come down, How shall I come down to thee? The things ye said to Young Hunting, The same ye're saying to me.’ 24 But it fell out on that same day The king was going to ride, And he calld for him Young Hunting, For to ride by his side. 25 Then out it speaks the little young son, Sat on the nurse's knee: ‘It fears me sair,’ said that young babe, ‘He's in bower wi yon ladie.’ 26 Then they hae calld her Lady Katharine, And she sware by the thorn That she saw not him Young Hunting Sin yesterday at morn. 27 Then they hae calld her Lady Maisry, And she sware by the moon That she saw not him Young Hunting Sin yesterday at noon. 28 ‘He was playing him at the Clyde's Water, Perhaps he has fa'en in:’ The king he calld his divers all, To dive for his young son. 29 They div'd in thro the wan burn-bank, Sae did they outthro the other: ‘We'll dive nae mair,’ said these young men, ‘Suppose he were our brother.’ 30 Then out it spake a little bird, That flew aboon their head: ‘Dive on, dive on, ye divers all, For there he lies indeed. 31 ‘But ye'll leave aff your day diving, And ye'll dive in the night; The pot where Young Hunting lies in, The candles they'll burn bright. 32 ‘There are twa ladies in yon bower, And even in yon ha, And they hae killd him Young Hunting, And casten him awa. 33 ‘They booted him, and spurred him, As he'd been gaun to ride, A hunting-horn tied round his neck, A sharp sword by his side 34 ‘The deepest pot o Clyde's Water, There they flang him in, Laid a turf on his breast-bane, To had Young Hunting down.’ 35 Now they left aff their day diving, And they dived on the night; The pot that Young Hunting lay in, The candles were burning bright. 36 The king he calld his hewers all, To hew down wood and thorn, For to put up a strong bale-fire, These ladies for to burn. 37 And they hae taen her Lady Katharine, And they hae pitten her in; But it wadna light upon her cheek, Nor woud it on her chin, But sang the points o her yellow hair, For healing the deadly sin. 38 Then they hae taen her Lady Maisry, And they hae put her in: First it lighted on her cheek, And syne upon her chin, And sang the points o her yellow hair, And she burnt like keckle-pin. 69 CLERK SAUNDERS Clerk Sanders CLERK SAUNDERS—A Herd's MSS, a, I, 177;

And kindly till him she did say ‘It's time, trew-love, ye wear awa.’ 18 They lay still, and sleeped sound, Untill the sun began to shine; She lookt between her and the wa, And dull and heavy was his eeen. 19 She thought it had been a loathsome sweat, A wat it had fallen this twa between; But it was the blood of his fair body, A wat his life days wair na lang. 20 ‘O Sanders, I'le do for your sake What other ladys would na thoule; When seven years is come and gone, There's near a shoe go on my sole. 21 ‘O Sanders, I'le do for your sake What other ladies would think mare;

Then you may swear, and safe your aith, You sawna Sandy sin yestreen. 5 ‘You'll take me up upo your back, And then you'll carry me to your bed; Then you may swear, and save your aith, Your board [-floor] Sandy never tred.’ 6 She's taen him upo her back, And she's carried him unto her bed, That she might swear, and safe her aith, Her board-floor Sandy never tread. 7 She's taen a napkin in her hand, And lo she did tie up her een, That she might swear, and safe her aith, She sawna Sandy syne yestreen. 8 They were na weel into the room, Nor yet laid weel into the bed, 9 When in came a' her seven brethern, And a' their torches burning bright;

A frightfu sight to see! What bluid is this on your sharp brand? O may ye not tell me?’ 7 ‘As I came thro the woods this night, The wolf maist worried me; O shoud I slain the wolf, Maisry? Or shoud the wolf slain me?’ 8 They hadna kissd, nor love clapped, As lovers when they meet, Till up it starts her auld father, Out o his drowsy sleep. 9 ‘O what's become o my house-cock, Sae crouse at ane did craw? I wonder as much at my bold watch, That's nae shooting ower the wa. 10 ‘My gude house-cock, my only son, Heir ower my land sae free, If ony ruffian hae him slain, High hanged shall he be.’ 11 Then he's on to Maisry's bower-door, And tirled at the pin: ‘Ye sleep ye, wake ye, daughter Maisry, Ye'll open, lat me come in.’ 12 Between the curtains and the wa She rowd her true-love then, And huly went she to the door, And let her father in. 13 ‘What's become o your maries, Maisry, Your bower it looks sae teem? What's become o your green claithing, Your beds they are sae thin?’ 14 ‘Gude forgie you, father,’ she said, ‘I wish ye be't for sin; Sae aft as ye hae dreaded me, But never found me wrang.’ 15 He turnd him right and round about, As he'd been gaun awa; But sae nimbly as he slippet in Behind a screen sae sma. 16 Maisry, thinking a' dangers past, She to her love did say, ‘Come, love, and take your silent rest; My auld father's away.’ 17 Then baith lockd in each other's arms, They fell full fast asleep, When up it starts her auld father, And stood at their bed-feet. 18 ‘I think I hae the villain now That my dear son did slay; But I shall be revengd on him Before I see the day.’ 19 Then he's drawn out a trusty brand, And stroakd it oer a stray, And thro and thro Sweet Willie's middle He's gart cauld iron gae. 20 Then up it wakend Lady Maisry, Out o her drowsy sleep, And when she saw her true-love slain, She straight began to weep. 21 ‘O gude forgie you now, father,’ she said, ‘I wish ye be't for sin; For I never lovd a love but ane, In my arms ye've him slain.’ 22 ‘This night he's slain my gude bold watch, Thirty stout men and twa; Likewise he's slain your ae brother, To me was worth them a'. 23 ‘If he has slain my ae brither, Himsell had a' the blame, For mony a day he plots contriv'd, To hae Sweet Willie slain. 24 ‘And tho he's slain your gude bold watch, He might hae been forgien; They came on him in armour bright, When he was but alane.’ 25 Nae meen was made for this young knight, In bower where he lay slain, But a' was for sweet Maisry bright, In fields where she ran brain. 71 THE BENT SAE BROWN THE BENT SAE BROWN Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 30. 1 ‘There are sixteen lang miles, I'm sure, Between my love and me; There are eight o them in gude dry land, And other eight by sea. 2 ‘Betide me life, betide me death, My love I'll gang and see; Altho her friends they do me hate, Her love is great for me. 3 ‘Of my coat I'll make a boat, And o my sark a sail, And o my cane a gude tapmast, Dry land till I come till.’ 4 Then o his coat he's made a boat, And o his sark a sail; And o his cane a gude tapmast, Dry land till he came till. 5 He is on to Annie's bower-door, And tirled at the pin: ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, my love, Annie, Ye'll rise, lat me come in.’ 6 ‘O who is this at my bower-door, Sae well that kens my name?’ ‘It is your true-love, Sweet Willie, For you I've crossd the faem.’ 7 ‘I am deeply sworn, Willie, By father and by mother; At kirk or market where we meet, We darna own each other. 8 ‘And I am deeply sworn, Willie, By my bauld brothers three; At kirk or market where we meet, I darna speak to thee.’ 9 ‘Ye take your red fan in your hand, Your white fan ower your een, And ye may swear, and save your oath, Ye sawna me come in. 10 ‘Ye take me in your arms twa, And carry me to your bed; And ye may swear, and save your oath, Your bower I never tread.’ 11 She's taen her red fan in her hand, The white fan ower her een; It was to swear, and save her oath, She sawna him come in. 12 She's taen him in her arms twa, And carried him to her bed; It was to swear, and save her oath, Her bower he never tread. 13 They hadna kissd, nor love clapped, As lovers do when they meet, Till up it waukens her mother, Out o her drowsy sleep. 14 ‘Win up, win up, my three bauld sons, Win up and make ye boun; Your sister's lover's in her bower, And he's but new come in.’ 15 Then up it raise her three bauld sons, And girt to them their brand, And they are to their sister's bower, As fast as they coud gang. 16 When they came to their sister's bower, They sought it up and down; But there was neither man nor boy In her bower to be foun. 17 Then out it speaks the first o them: ‘We'll gang and lat her be; For there is neither man nor boy Intill her companie.’ 18 Then out it speaks the second son: ‘Our travel's a' in vain; But mother dear, nor father dear, Shall break our rest again.’ 19 Then out it speaks the third o them, An ill death mat he die! ‘We'll lurk amang the bent sae brown, That Willie we may see.’ 20 He stood behind his love's curtains, His goud rings showd him light; And by this ye may a' weell guess He was a renowned knight. 21 He's done him to his love's stable, Took out his berry-brown steed; His love stood in her bower-door, Her heart was like to bleed. 22 ‘O mourn ye for my coming, love? Or for my short staying? Or mourn ye for our safe sindring, Case we never meet again?’ 23 ‘I mourn nae for your here coming, Nor for your staying lang; Nor mourn I for our safe sindring, I hope we'll meet again. 24 ‘I wish ye may won safe away, And safely frae the town; For ken you not my brothers three Are mang the bent sae brown?’ 25 ‘If I were on my berry-brown steed, And three miles frae the town, I woudna fear your three bauld brothers, Amang the bent sae brown.’ 26 He leint him ower his saddle-bow, And kissd her lips sae sweet; The tears that fell between these twa, They wat his great steed's feet. 27 But he wasna on his berry-brown steed, Nor twa miles frae the town, Till up it starts these three fierce men, Amang the bent sae brown. 28 Then up they came like three fierce men, Wi mony shout and cry: ‘Bide still, bide still, ye cowardly youth, What makes your haste away? 29 ‘For I must know before you go, Tell me, and make nae lie; If ye've been in my sister's bower, My hands shall gar ye die.’ 30 ‘Tho I've been in your sister's bower, I have nae fear o thee; I'll stand my ground, and fiercely fight, Aud shall gain victorie.’ 31 ‘Now I entreat you for to stay, Unto us gie a wad; If ye our words do not obey, I'se gar your body bleed.’ 32 ‘I have nae wad, says Sweet Willie, Unless it be my brand, And that shall guard my fair body, Till I win frae your hand.’ 33 Then two o them stept in behind, All in a furious meed; The third o them came him before, And seizd his berry-brown steed. 34 O then he drew his trusty brand, That hang down by his gare, And he has slain these three fierce men, And left them sprawling there. 35 Then word has gane to her mother, In bed where she slept soun, That Willie had killd her three bauld sons, Amang the bent sae brown. 36 Then she has cut the locks that hung Sae low down by her ee, Sae has she kiltit her green claithing A little aboon her knee. 37 And she has on to the king's court, As fast as gang coud she; When Fair Annie got word o that, Was there as soon as she. 38 Her mother, when before the king, Fell low down on her knee; ‘Win up, win up, my dame,’ he said, ‘What is your will wi me?’ 39 ‘My wills they are not sma, my liege, The truth I'll tell to thee; There is ane o your courtly knights Last night hae robbed me.’ 40 ‘And has he broke your bigly bowers? Or has he stole your fee? There is nae knight into my court Last night has been frae me; 41 ‘Unless't was Willie o Lauderdale, Forbid that it be he!’ ‘And by my sooth,’ says the auld woman, ‘That very man is he. 42 ‘For he has broke my bigly bowers, And he has stole my fee, And made my daughter Ann a whore, And an ill woman is she. 43 ‘That was not all he did to me, Ere he went frae the town; My sons sae true he fiercely slew, Amang the bent sae brown.’ 44 Then out it spake her daughter Ann, She stood by the king's knee: ‘Ye lie, ye lie, my mother dear, Sae loud's I hear you lie. 45 ‘He has not broke your bigly bowers, Nor has he stole your fee, Nor made your daughter Ann a whore; A good woman I'll be. 46 ‘Altho he slew your three bauld sons, He weel might be forgien; They were well clad in armour bright, Whan my love was him lane.’ 47 ‘Well spoke, well spoke,’ the king replied, ‘This tauking pleases me; For ae kiss o your lovely mouth, I'll set your true-love free.’ 48 She's taen the king in her arms, And kissd him cheek and chin; He then set her behind her love, And they went singing hame. 72 THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owsenford THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD—A Kinloch MSS, V, 403, in the handwriting of James Chambers, as sung to his maternal grandmother, Janet Grieve, seventy years before, by an old woman, a Miss Ann Gray, of Neidpath Castle, Peeblesshire; January 1, 1829. 1 O I will sing to you a sang, But oh my heart is sair!

Or what is it that ye lie for, Sae sair bound as ye lie?’ 8 ‘We lie not here for owsen, dear father, Nor yet lie here for kye, But it's for a little o dear bought love Sae sair bound as we lie.’ 9 O he's gane to the mighty mayor, And he spoke powerfully: ‘Will ye grant me my twa sons' lives, Either for gold or fee? Or will ye be sae gude a man As grant them baith to me?’ 10 ‘I'll no grant ye yere twa sons' lives, Neither for gold or fee, Nor will I be sae gude a man As gie them back to thee; Before the morn at twelve o'clock Ye'll see them hangit hie.’ 11 Up an spak his twa daughters, An they spak powrfully: ‘Will ye grant us our twa loves' lives, Either for gold or fee?

Ye should hae brought them wi ye.’ 16 ‘It's I've putten them to a deeper lair, An to a higher schule; Yere ain twa sons ill no be here Till the hallow days o Yule.’ 17 ‘O sorrow, sorrow come mak my bed, An dool come lay me doon! For I'll neither eat nor drink, Nor set a fit on ground.’ The Clerks o Owsenfoord THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD—B Noted down from a female servant by Dr Joseph Robertson, July 15, 1829; “Adversaria,” p. 67. 1 ‘De weel, de weel, my twa young sons, An learn weel at the squeel; Tak no up wi young women-kin, An learn to act the feel.’ 2 But they had na been in Blomsbury A twalmon and a day, Till the twa pretty clerks o Owsenfoord Wi the mayr's dauchters did lay. 3 Word has gaen till the auld base mayr, As he sat at his wine, That the twa pretty clerks o Owsenford Wi his daughters had lien. 4 Then out bespak the auld base mayr, An an angry man was he: ‘Tomorrow, before I eat meat or drink, I'll see them hanged hie.’ 5 But word has gaen to Owsenfoord Before the letter was read, She let the tears doun fa. 6 ‘Your sons are weel, an verra weel, An learnin at the squeel; But I fear ye winna see your sons At the holy days o Yeel.’ 7 Their father he went to Bloomsbury, He turnit him roun about, An there he saw his twa braw sons, In the prison, leukin out. 8 ‘O lie ye there for owsen, my sons, Or lie ye there for kye? Or lie ye there for dear fond love, Si closs as ye de lie?’ 9 ‘We lie na here for owsen, father, We lie na here for kye, But we lie here for dear fond love, An we're condemned to die.’ 10 Then out bespak the clerks' fader, An a sorry man was he: ‘Gae till your bowers, ye lillie-flowers, For a' this winna dee.’ 11 Then out bespak the aul base mayr, An an angry man was he: ‘Gar to your bowers, ye vile base whores, Ye'll see them hanged hie.’ The Clerks of Oxenford THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD—C Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 281. 1 I'll tell you a tale, or I'll sing you a song, Will grieve your heart full sair; How the twa bonny clerks o Oxenford Went aff to learn their lear. 2 Their father lovd them very weel, Their mother muckle mair, And sent them on to Billsbury, To learn deeper lear. 3 Then out it spake their mother dear: ‘Do weel, my sons, do weel, And haunt not wi the young women, Wi them to play the fiel.’ 4 Their father sware them on their souls, Their mother on their life, Never to lie wi the auld mayor's daughters, Nor kiss the young mayor's wife. 5 But they hadna been in Billsbury A twallmonth and a day, Till the twa bonny clerks o Oxenford With the mayor's twa daughters lay. 6 As these twa clerks they sat and wrote, The ladies sewed and sang; There was mair mirth in that chamber Than all fair Ferrol's land. 7 But word's gane to the wicked mayor, As he sat at the wine, That the twa bonny clerks o Oxenford With his twa daughters had lyne. 8 ‘O have they lain with my daughters dear, Heirs out ower a' my land, The morn, ere I eat or drink, I'll hang them with my hand.’ 9 Then he has taen the twa bonny clerks, Bound them frae tap to tae, Till the reddest blood in their body Out ower their nails did gae. 10 ‘Whare will I get a little wee boy, Will win gowd to his fee, That will rin on to Oxenford, And that right speedilie?’ 11 Then up it starts a bonny boy, Gold yellow was his hair; I wish his father and mother joy, His true-love muckle mair. 12 Says, Here am I, a little wee boy, Will win gowd to my fee, That will rin on to Oxenford, And that right speedilie. 13 ‘Where ye find the grass green growing, Set down your heel and rin, And where ye find the brigs broken, Ye'll bend your bow and swim. 14 ‘But when ye come to Oxenford, Bide neither to chap nor ca, But set your bent bow to your breast, And lightly loup the wa.’ 15 Where he found the grass green growing, He slackt his shoes and ran, And where he found the brigs broken, He bent his bow and swam. 16 And when he came to Oxenford, Did neither chap nor ca, But set his bent bow to his breast, And lightly leapt the wa. 17 ‘What news, what news, my little wee boy? What news hae ye to me? How are my sons in Billsbury, Since they went far frae me?’ 18 ‘Your sons are well, and learning well, But at a higher school, And ye'll never see your sons again, On the holy days o Yule.’ 19 ‘Wi sorrow now gae make my bed, Wi care and caution lay me down; That man on earth shall neer be born Shall see me mair gang on the groun. 20 ‘Take twenty pounds in your pocket, And ten and ten to tell them wi, And gin ye getna hynde Henry, Bring ye gay Gilbert hame to me.’ 21 Out it speaks old Oxenford, A sorry, sorry man, was he: ‘Your strange wish does me surprise, They are baith there alike to me. 22 ‘Wi sorrow now I'll saddle my horse, And I will gar my bridle ring, And I shall be at Billsbury Before the small birds sweetly sing.’ 23 Then sweetly sang the nightingale, As she sat on the wand, But sair, sair, mournd Oxenford, As he gaed in the strand. 24 When he came to Billsbury, He rade it round about, And at a little shott-window His sons were looking out. 25 ‘O lye ye there, my sons,’ he said, ‘For oxen, or for kye? Or is it for a little o deep dear love, Sae sair bound as ye lye?’ 26 ‘We lye not here, father,’ they said, ‘For oxen, nor for kye; It's all for a little o deep dear love, Sae sair bound as we lye. 27 ‘O borrow's, borrow's, father,’ they said, ‘For the love we bear to thee!’ ‘O never fear, my pretty sons, Well borrowed ye shall be.’ 28 Then he's gane to the wicked mayor, And hailed him courteouslie: ‘Good day, good day, O Billsbury, God make you safe and free!’ ‘Come sit you down, brave Oxenford, What are your wills with me?’ 29 ‘Will ye gie me my sons again, For gold or yet for fee? Will ye gie me my sons again, For's sake that died on tree?’ 30 ‘I winna gie you your sons again, For gold nor yet for fee; But if ye'll stay a little while, Ye'se see them hanged hie.’ 31 Ben it came the mayor's daughters, Wi kirtle, coat alone; Their eyes did sparkle like the gold, As they tript on the stone. 32 ‘Will ye gie us our loves, father, For gold or yet for fee? Or will ye take our own sweet life, And let our true-loves be?’ 33 He's taen a whip into his hand, And lashd them wondrous sair: Gae to your bowers, ye vile rank whores, Ye'se never see them mair. 34 Then out it speaks old Oxenford, A sorry man was he: ‘Gang to your bowers, ye lily-flowers, For a' this maunna be.’ 35 Out it speaks him hynde Henry: ‘Come here, Janet, to me; Will ye gie me my faith and troth, And love, as I gae thee?’ 36 ‘Ye shall hae your faith and troth, Wi God's blessing and mine;’ And twenty times she kissd his mouth, Her father looking on. 37 Then out it speaks him gay Gilbert: ‘Come here, Margaret, to me; Will ye gie me my faith and troth, And love, as I gae thee?’ 38 ‘Yes, ye shall get your faith and troth, Wi God's blessing and mine;’ And twenty times she kissd his mouth, Her father looking on. 39 ‘Ye'll take aff your twa black hats, Lay them down on a stone, That nane may ken that ye are clerks Till ye are putten down.’ 40 The bonny clerks they died that morn, Their loves died lang ere noon; Their father and mother for sorrow died, They all died very soon. 41 These six souls went up to heaven, I wish sae may we a'! The mighty mayor went down to hell, For wrong justice and law. The Clerks Two Sons of Oxenfoord THE CLERK'S TWA SONS O OWSENFORD—D Motherwell's MS., p. 433, from James Nicol, Strichen. 1 Oh I will tell a tale of woe, Which makes my heart richt sair; The Clerk's two sons of Oxenfoord Are too soon gone to lair. 2 They thought their father's service mean, Their mother's no great affair; But they would go to fair Berwick, To learn [some] unco lair. 3 They had not been in fair Berwick A twelve month and a day, Till the clerk's two sons of Oxenfoord With the mayor's two daughters lay. 4 This word came to the mighty mayor, As he hunted the rae, That the clerks two sons of Oxenfoord With his two daughters lay. 5 ‘If they have lain with my daughters, The heirs of all my land, I make a vow, and will keep it true, To hang them with my hand.’ 6 When he was certain of the fact, An angry man was he, And he has taken these two brothers, And hanged them on the tree. 7 Word it has come to Oxenfoord's clerk, Ere it was many day, That his two sons sometime ago With the mayor's two daughters lay. 8 ‘O saddle a horse to me,’ he cried, ‘O do it quick and soon, That I may ride to fair Berwick, And see what can be done.’ 9 But when he came to fair Berwick A grieved man was he, When that he saw his two bonnie sons Both hanging on the tree. 10 ‘O woe is me,’ the clerk cried out, ‘This dismal sight to see, All the whole comfort of my life Dead hanging on the tree!’ 11 He turned his horse's head about, Making a piteous moan, And all the way to Oxenfoord Did sad and grievously groan. 12 His wife did hastily cry out, ‘You only do I see; What have you done with my two sons, You should have brought to me?’ 13 ‘I put them to some higher lair, And to a deeper scule; You will not see your bonnie sons Till the haly days of Yule. 14 ‘And I will spend my days in grief, Will never laugh nor sing; There's never a man in Oxenfoord Shall hear my bridle ring.’ 73 LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET Lord Thomas and Fair Annet LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET—A Percy's Reliques, 1765, II, 293, “given, with some corrections, from a MS. copy transmitted from Scotland.” 1 Lord Thomas and Fair Annet Sate a' day on a hill; Whan night was cum, and sun was sett, They had not talkt their fill. 2 Lord Thomas said a word in jest, Fair Annet took it ill: ‘A, I will nevir wed a wife Against my ain friends' will.’ 3 ‘Gif ye wull nevir wed a wife, A wife wull neir wed yee:’ Sae he is hame to tell his mither, And knelt upon his knee. 4 ‘O rede, O rede, mither,’ he says, ‘A gude rede gie to mee; O sall I tak the nut-browne bride, And let Faire Annet bee?’ 5 ‘The nut-browne bride haes gowd and gear, Fair Annet she has gat nane; And the little beauty Fair Annet haes O it wull soon be gane.’ 6 And he has till his brother gane: ‘Now, brother, rede ye mee; A, sall I marrie the nut-browne bride, And let Fair Annet bee?’ 7 ‘The nut-browne bride has oxen, brother, The nut-browne bride has kye; I wad hae ye marrie the nut-browne bride, And cast Fair Annet bye.’ 8 ‘Her oxen may dye i the house, billie, And her kye into the byre, And I sall hae nothing to mysell Bot a fat fadge by the fyre.’ 9 And he has till his sister gane: ‘Now, sister, rede ye mee; O sall I marrie the nut-browne bride, And set Fair Annet free?’ 10 ‘I'se rede ye tak Fair Annet, Thomas, And let the browne bride alane; Lest ye sould sigh, and say, Alace, What is this we brought hame!’ 11 ‘No, I will tak my mither's counsel, And marrie me owt o hand; And I will tak the nut-browne bride, Fair Annet may leive the land.’ 12 Up then rose Fair Annet's father, Twa hours or it wer day, And he is gane into the bower Wherein Fair Annet lay. 13 ‘Rise up, rise up, Fair Annet,’ he says, ‘Put on your silken sheene; Let us gae to St. Marie's kirke, And see that rich weddeen.’ 14 ‘My maides, gae to my dressing-roome, And dress to me my hair; Whaireir yee laid a plait before, See yee lay ten times mair. 15 ‘My maids, gae to my dressing-room, And dress to me my smock; The one half is o the holland fine, The other o needle-work.’ 16 The horse Fair Annet rade upon, He amblit like the wind; Wi siller he was shod before, Wi burning gowd behind. 17 Four and twanty siller bells Wer a' tyed till his mane, And yae tift o the norland wind, They tinkled ane by ane. 18 Four and twanty gay gude knichts Rade by Fair Annet's side, And four and twanty fair ladies, As gin she had bin a bride. 19 And whan she cam to Marie's kirk, She sat on Marie's stean: The cleading that Fair Annet had on It skinkled in their een. 20 And whan she cam into the kirk, She shimmerd like the sun; The belt that was about her waist Was a' wi pearles bedone. 21 She sat her by the nut-browne bride, And her een they wer sae clear, Lord Thomas he clean forgat the bride, Whan Fair Annet drew near. 22 He had a rose into his hand, He gae it kisses three, And reaching by the nut-browne bride, Laid it on Fair Annet's knee. 23 Up than spak the nut-browne bride, She spak wi meikle spite: ‘And whair gat ye that rose-water, That does mak yee sae white?’ 24 ‘O I did get the rose-water Whair ye wull neir get nane, For I did get that very rose-water Into my mither's wame.’ 25 The bride she drew a long bodkin Frae out her gay head-gear, And strake Fair Annet unto the heart, That word spak nevir mair. 26 Lord Thomas he saw Fair Annet wex pale, And marvelit what mote bee; But whan he saw her dear heart's blude, A' wood-wroth wexed hee. 27 He drew his dagger, that was sae sharp, That was sae sharp and meet, And drave it into the nut-browne bride, That fell deid at his feit. 28 ‘Now stay for me, dear Annet,’ he sed, ‘Now stay, my dear,’ he cry'd; Then strake the dagger untill his heart, And fell deid by her side. 29 Lord Thomas was buried without kirk-wa, Fair Annet within the quiere, And o the tane thair grew a birk, The other a bonny briere. 30 And ay they grew, and ay they threw, As they wad faine be neare; And by this ye may ken right weil They were twa luvers deare.

I think ye micht see my heart's blude, Come rinning by my knee.’ 35 Then Willie took a little sword, Which he kept secret there, And strak the brown bride to the heart, A word she neer spak mair. 36 And after that a' this was dune, He drew it through the strae, And through his ain fair bodie He causd the cauld iron gae. 37 The last words that Sweet Willie spak, His heart was almaist gane; ‘May never a young man like me Have sic a sad wedding. 38 ‘For gear will come, and gear will gang, And gear's ae but a lend, And monie a ane for warld's gear A silly brown bride brings hame.’ 39 Sweet Willie was buried in Mary's kirk, And Annie in Mary's quire, And out o the ane there grew a birk, And out o the ither a brier. 40 And ae they grew, and ae they threw, Until the twa did meet, That ilka ane micht plainly see They were true lovers sweet. The Brown Bride and Lord Thomas LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET—C Motherwell's MS., p. 157, from the recitation of Agnes Laird, Kilbarchan, 1825. 1 ‘Come read my rede, O mother dear, Come riddle it all in one; O whether will I take Fair Annie, Or bring the brown bride home?’ 2 ‘The brown, brown bride has kye and ewes, Fair Annie she has none; She has nothing but a bonny, bonny face, And that'll soon be gone.’ 3 ‘Where will I get a pretty little boy, That'll rin my errands soon, That will rin to Fair Annie's bower, And bid her to my wedding?’ 4 ‘Here am I, a pretty little boy, That'll rin your errands soon, That will rin to Fair Annie's bower, And bid her to your wedding.’ 5 ‘Forbid her to put on her silks so black, Or yet her silks so brown; But she must put on her suddled silks, That she wears up and down. 6 ‘Forbid her to put on her silks so green, Or yet her silks so gray; But she must put on her suddled silks, That she wears every day.’ 7 When he gade to Fair Annie's bower, He tirled at the pin; So ready was Fair Annie hersell To open and let him in. 8 ‘What news, what news, my little boy? What news hast thou to me?’ ‘You must prepare for Lord Thomas’ wedding, And that's bad news for thee.’ 9 ‘Good news, good news,’ Fair Annie says, ‘Good news is it for me, For me to be bride and him bridegroom, And that's good news for me.’ 10 ‘He forbids thee to put on thy silks so black, Or yet thy silks so brown; But thou must put on thy suddled silks, That thou wears up and down. 11 ‘He forbids you to put on thy silks so green, Or yet thy silks so gray; But thou must on thy suddled silks, That thou wears every day.’ 12 ‘There are smiths into my smiddy-bour That'll dress to me a steed, There are tailors in my tailor-house That'll dress to me a weed. 13 ‘There are maidens in my maiden-bower That'll lay gold in my hair, And where eer there were ane link before, It shall be nine times mair.’ 14 Then Annie got herself attired, In all things very fine, With red ribbons, and silks so fair, That owre her shoulders shine. 15 When she came to Lord Thomas' yett, She shined amang them a', And the buttons on Lord Thomas' coat Brusted and brak in twa. 16 ‘Brown, brown is your steed,’ she says, ‘But browner is your bride; But gallant is that handkerchy That hideth her din hide.’ 17 ‘O hold thy peace, Fair Annie,’ he says, ‘Speak not of that to me, For happy is that bonny, bonny lad That leads his life with thee.’ 18 Then out bespoke the brown, brown bride, And she spoke out with spite: ‘O whare gets thou that water-cherry, That washes thee so white?’ 19 ‘I got in my father's garden, Below an olive tree, And although thou war to seek long seven years That water thou'll never see. 20 ‘Tho thou hast got Lord Thomas' hand That water thou'll neer see; For thou's sunbrunt from thy mother's womb, And thou'll never be like me.’ Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET—D a.

Oh dost thou not see my own heart's blood Runs trickling down my knee?’ 18 Lord Thomas he had a sword by his side, As he walked about the hall; He cut off his bride's head from her shoulders, And he threw it against the wall. 19 He set the hilte against the ground, And the point against his heart; There was never three lovers that ever met More sooner they did depart.

She has nae ither grace.’ 12 ‘Alas, alas!’ says Sweet Willie, ‘But white is Annie's hand!’ ‘But what's the matter, my son Willie?

FAIR MARGARET AND SWEET WILLIAM—B Communicated to Percy by the Dean of Derry, as written down from memory by his mother, Mrs Bernard; February, 1776. 1 Sweet William would a wooing ride, His steed was lovely brown; A fairer creature than Lady Margaret Sweet William could find none. 2 Sweet William came to Lady Margaret's bower, And knocked at the ring, And who so ready as Lady Margaret To rise and to let him in. 3 Down then came her father dear, Clothed all in blue: ‘I pray, Sweet William, tell to me What love's between my daughter and you?’ 4 ‘I know none by her,’ he said, ‘And she knows none by me; Before tomorrow at this time Another bride you shall see.’ 5 Lady Margaret at her bower-window, Combing of her hair, She saw Sweet William and his brown bride Unto the church repair. 6 Down she cast her iv'ry comb, And up she tossd her hair, She went out from her bowr alive, But never so more came there. 7 When day was gone, and night was come, All people were asleep, In glided Margaret's grimly ghost, And stood at William's feet. 8 ‘How d'ye like your bed, Sweet William? How d'ye like your sheet? And how d'ye like that brown lady, That lies in your arms asleep?’ 9 ‘Well I like my bed, Lady Margaret, And well I like my sheet; But better I like that fair lady That stands at my bed's feet.’ 10 When night was gone, and day was come, All people were awake, The lady waket out of her sleep, And thus to her lord she spake. 11 ‘I dreamd a dream, my wedded lord, That seldom comes to good; I dreamd that our bowr was lin'd with white swine, And our brid-chamber full of blood.’ 12 He called up his merry men all, By one, by two, by three, ‘We will go to Lady Margaret's bower, With the leave of my wedded lady.’ 13 When he came to Lady Margaret's bower, He knocked at the ring, And who were so ready as her brethren To rise and let him in. 14 ‘Oh is she in the parlor,’ he said, ‘Or is she in the hall? Or is she in the long chamber, Amongst her merry maids all?’ 15 ‘She's not in the parlor,’ they said, ‘Nor is she in the hall; But she is in the long chamber, Laid out against the wall.’ 16 ‘Open the winding sheet,’ he cry'd, ‘That I may kiss the dead; That I may kiss her pale and wan Whose lips used to look so red.’ 17 Lady Margaret [died] on the over night, Sweet William died on the morrow; Lady Margaret died for pure, pure love, Sweet William died for sorrow. 18 On Margaret's grave there grew a rose, On Sweet William's grew a briar; They grew till they joind in a true lover's knot, And then they died both together. FAIR MARGARET AND SWEET WILLIAM—C Communicated to Percy by Rev. P. Parsons, of Wye, April 7, 1770. 1 As Margaret stood at her window so clear, A combing back her hair, She saw Sweet William and his gay bride Unto the church draw near. 2 Then down she threw her ivory comb, She turned back her hair; There was a fair maid at that window, She's gone, she'll come no more there. 3 In the night, in the middle of the night, When all men were asleep, There walkd a ghost, Fair Margaret's ghost, And stood at his bed's feet. 4 Sweet William he dremed a dream, and he said, ‘I wish it prove for good; My chamber was full of wild men's wine, And my bride-bed stood in blood.’ 5 Then he calld up his stable-groom, To saddle his nag with speed: ‘This night will I ride to Fair Margaret's bowr, With the leave of my lady. 6 ‘Oh is Fair Margaret in the kitchen? Or is she in the hall? 7 ‘No, she is not in the kitchen,’ they cryed, ‘Nor is she in the hall; But she is in the long chamber, Laid up against the wall.’ 8 Go with your right side to Newcastle, And come with your left side home, There you will see those two lovers Lie printed on one stone. 75 LORD LOVEL Lady Ouncebell LORD LOVEL—A Percy Papers, communicated by the Rev. P. Parsons, of Wye, from singing; May 22, 1770, and April 19, 1775. 1 ‘And I fare you well, Lady Ouncebell, For I must needs be gone, And this time two year I'll meet you again, To finish the loves we begun.’ 2 ‘That is a long time, Lord Lovill,’ said she, ‘To live in fair Scotland;’ ‘And so it is, Lady Ouncebell, To leave a fair lady alone.’ 3 He had not been in fair Scotland Not half above half a year, But a longin mind came into his head, Lady Ouncebell he woud go see her. 4 He called up his stable-groom, To sadle his milk-white stead; Dey down, dey down, dey down dery down, I wish Lord Lovill good speed. 5 He had not been in fair London Not half above half a day, But he heard the bells of the high chapel ring, They rang with a ceserera. 6 He asked of a gentleman, That set there all alone, What made the bells of the high chapel ring, The ladys make all their moan. 7 ‘One of the king's daughters are dead,’ said he, ‘Lady Ouncebell was her name; She died for love of a courtous young night, Lord Lovill he was the same.’ 8 He caused her corps to be set down, And her winding sheet undone, And he made a vow before them all He'd never kiss wowman again. 9 Lady Ouncebell died on the yesterday, Lord Lovill on the morrow; Lady Ouncebell died for pure true love, Lord Lovill died for sorrow. 10 Lady Ouncebell was buried in the high chancel, Lord Lovill in the choir; Lady Ouncebell's breast sprung out a sweet rose, Lord Lovill's a bunch of sweet brier. 11 They grew till they grew to the top of the church, And then they could grow no higher; They grew till they grew to a true-lover's not, And then they tyed both together. 12 An old wowman coming by that way, And a blessing she did crave, To cut off a bunch of that true-lover's not, And buried them both in one grave. Lord Lavel LORD LOVEL—B Kinloch MSS, I, 45, from the recitation of Mary Barr, of Lesmahago, “aged upwards of 70,” May, 1827. 1 Lord Lavel he stands at his stable-door, Kaiming his milk-white steed; And by and cam Fair Nancybelle, And wished Lord Lavel good speed. 2 ‘O whare are ye going, Lord Lavel?’ she said, ‘I pray ye tell to me:’ ‘O I am going to merry England, To win your love aff me.’ 3 ‘And when will ye return again?’ she said, ‘Lord Lavel, pray tell to me:’ ‘Whan seven lang years are past and gane, Fair Nancybelle, I'll return to thee.’ 4 ‘'Tis too lang, Lord Lavel,’ she said, ‘'Tis too lang for me; 'Tis too long, Lord Lavel,’ she said, ‘A true lover for to see.’ 5 He had na been in merry England A month but barely three, Till languishing thoughts cam into his mind, And Nancybelle fain wad he see. 6 He rade, and he rade, alang the hieway, Till he cam to yonder toun; He heard the sound o a fine chapel-bell, And the ladies were mourning roun. 7 He rade, and he rade, alang the hieway, Till he cam to yonder hall; He heard the sound o a fine chapel-bell, And the ladies were mourning all. 8 He asked wha it was that was dead, The ladies did him tell: They said, It is the king's daughter, Her name is Fair Nancybelle; She died for the love of a courteous young knicht, His name is Lord Lavel. 9 ‘O hast thou died, Fair Nancybelle, O hast thou died for me! O hast thou died, Fair Nancybelle! Then I will die for thee.’ 10 Fair Nancybelle died, as it might be, this day, Lord Lavel he died tomorrow; Fair Nancybelle died with pure, pure love, Lord Lavel he died with sorrow. 11 Lord Lavel was buried in Mary's kirk, Nancybelle in Mary's quire; And out o the ane there grew a birk, Out the other a bonny brier. 12 And ae they grew, and ae they threw, Until they twa did meet, That ilka ane might plainly see They war twa lovers sweet. Lord Travell LORD LOVEL—C Communicated by Mr Alexander Laing, 1873, as taken down from the recitation of Miss Fanny Walker, of Mount Pleasant, near Newburgh-on-Tay. 1 Lord Travell stands in his stable-door, Dressing his milk-white steed, An bye comes Lady Ounceville: ‘I wish you muckle speed. 2 ‘Oh whar are ye gaun, Lord Travell?’ she says, ‘Whar are gaun frae me?’ ‘I am gaun to London town, Some strange things for to see.’ 3 ‘Whan will ye be back, Lord Travell?’ she says, ‘Whan will ye be back to me?’ ‘I will be back in seven lang years, To wed my gay ladie.’ 4 ‘Oh that is too lang for me,’ she says, ‘Oh that is too lang for me; Oh that is too lang for me,’ she says, ‘To wed thy gay ladie.’ 5 He hadna been in London town A week but only three, Whan a boding voice thirld in his ear, That Scotland he maun see. 6 He rade an he rode alang the highway, Till he cam to yon little town: ‘Oh is there ony body dead? The bells they mak sic a sound.’ 7 He rade an he rode alang the highway, Till he cam to yon little town: ‘Oh is there ony body dead? The folk gae mournin round.’ 8 ‘Oh yes indeed, there is ane dead, Her name is Ounceville; An she has died for a courteous knicht, His name is Lord Travell.’ 9 ‘Oh hand ye aboot, ye gentlemen, The white bread an the wine, For the morn's nicht aboot this time Ye'll do the same for mine!’ Lord Lovel LORD LOVEL—D Kinloch MSS, VII, 83, from the recitation of a lady of Roxburghshire; Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 31. 1 Lord Lovel stands at his stable-door, Mounted upon a grey steed, And bye cam Ladie Nanciebel, And wishd Lord Lovel much speed. 2 ‘O whare are ye going, Lord Lovel? My dearest, tell unto me:’ ‘I am going a far journey, Some strange countrey to see. 3 ‘But I'll return in seven long years, Lady Nanciebel to see:’ ‘Oh seven, seven, seven long years, They are much too long for me.’ 4 He was gane about a year away, A year but barely ane, Whan a strange fancy cam intil his head That faire Nanciebel was gane. 5 It's then he rade, and better rade, Untill he cam to the toun, And there he heard a dismal noise, For the church bells au did soun. 6 He asked what the bells rang for; They said, It's for Nanciebel; She died for a discourteous squire, And his name is Lord Lovel. 7 The lid of the coffin he opened up, The linens he faulded doun, And ae he kissd her pale, pale lips, And the tears cam trinkling doun. 8 ‘Weill may I kiss these pale, pale lips, For they will never kiss me; I'll mak a vow, and I'll keep it true, That I'll neer kiss ane but thee.’ 9 Lady Nancie died on Tuesday's nicht, Lord Lovel upon the niest day; Lady Nancie died for pure, pure love, Lord Lovel for deep sorraye. LORD LOVEL—E Communicated by J.F. Campbell, Esq., as learned from the singing of an English gentleman, about 1850. 1 ‘Now fare ye well, Lady Oonzabel, For I must needs be gone, To visit the king of fair Scotland, Oh I must be up and ride.’ 2 So he called unto him his little foot-page, To saddle his milk-white steed; Hey down, hey down, hey derry, hey down, How I wish my Lord Lovel good speed! 3 He had not been in fair Scotland, Not passing half a year, When a lover-like thought came into his head, Lady Oonzabel he would go see her. 4 So he called unto him his little foot-page, To saddle his milk-white steed; Hey down, hey down, hey derry, hey down, How I wish my Lord Lovel good speed. 5 He had not been in fair England, Not passing half a day, When the bells of the high chappel did ring, And they made a loud sassaray. 6 He asked of an old gentleman Who was sitting there all alone, Why the bells of the high chappel did ring, And the ladies were making a moan. 7 ‘Oh, the king's fair daughter is dead,’ said he; ‘Her name's Lady Oonzabel; And she died for the love of a courteous young knight, And his name it is Lord Lovel.’ 8 He caused the bier to be set down, The winding sheet undone, And drawing forth his rapier bright, Through his own true heart did it run. 9 Lady Oonzabel lies in the high chappel, Lord Lovel he lies in the quier; And out of the one there grew up a white rose, And out of the other a brier. 10 And they grew, and they grew, to the high chappel top; They could not well grow any higher; And they twined into a true lover's knot, So in death they are joined together. Lord Lovel LORD LOVEL—F Communicated by Mr Robert White, of Newcastle-on-Tyne. 1 As Lord Lovel was at the stable-door, Mounting his milk-white steed, Who came by but poor Nancy Bell, And she wished Lovel good speed. 2 ‘O where are ye going, Lord Lovel?’ she said, ‘How long to tarry from me?’ ‘Before six months are past and gone, Again I'll return to thee.’ 3 He had not been a twelvemonth away, A twelvemonth and a day, Till Nancy Bell grew sick and sad, She pined and witherd away. 4 The very first town that he came to, He heard the death-bell knell; The very next town that he came to, They said it was Nancy Bell. 5 He orderd the coffin to be broke open, The sheet to be turned down, And then he kissd her cold pale lips, Till the tears ran tricklin down. 6 The one was buried in St. John's church, The other in the choir; From Nancy Bell sprang a bonny red rose, From Lord Lovel a bonny briar. 7 They grew, and they grew, to the height o the church, To they met from either side, And at the top a true lover's knot Shows that one for the other had died. Lord Revel LORD LOVEL—G Harris MS., fol. 28 b, from the recitation of Mrs Molison, Dunlappie. 1 Lord Revel he stands in his stable-door, He was dressing a milk-white steed; A lady she stands in her bour-door, A dressin with haste an speed. 2 ‘O where are you goin, Lord Revel,’ she said, ‘Where are you going from me?’ ‘It's I am going to Lonnon toun, That fair city for to see.’ 3 ‘When will you be back, Lord Revel?’ she said, ‘When will you be back to me?’ ‘I will be back in the space of three years, To wed you, my gey ladie.’ 4 ‘That's too long a time for me,’ she said, ‘That's too long a time for me; For I'll be dead long time ere that, For want of your sweet companie.’ 5 He had not been in Lonnon toun A month but barely three, When word was brought that Isabell Was sick, an like to dee. 6 He had not been in Lonnon toun A year but barely ane, When word was brought from Lonnon toun That Isabell was gane. 7 He rode an he rode along the high way, Till he came to Edenborrow toon: Is there any fair lady dead,’ said he, ‘That the bells gie such a tone?’ 8 ‘Oh yes, there's a ladie, a very fine ladie, Her name it is Isabell; She died for the sake of a young Scottish knight, His name it is Lord Revel.’ 9 ‘Deal well, deal well at Isabell's burial The biscuit and the beer, An gainst the morrow at this same time You'll aye deal mair and mair. 10 ‘Deal well, deal well at Isabell's burial The white bread and the wine, An gainst the morn at this same time You'll deal the same at mine.’ 11 They dealt well, dealt weel at Isabell's burial The biscuit an the beer, And gainst the morn at that same time They dealt them mair an mair. 12 They dealt well, dealt weel at Isabell's burial The white bread an the wine, An gainst the morn at that same time They dealt the same again.

Davidson's Universal Melodist, I, 148. 1 Lord Lovel he stood at his castle-gate, Combing his milk-white steed, When up came Lady Nancy Belle, To wish her lover good speed, speed, To wish her lover good speed. 2 ‘Where are you going, Lord Lovel?’ she said, ‘Oh where are you going?’ said she; ‘I'm going, my Lady Nancy Belle, Strange countries for to see.’ 3 ‘When will you be back, Lord Lovel?’ she said, ‘Oh when will you come back?’ said she; ‘In a year or two, or three, at the most, I'll return to my fair Nancy.’ 4 But he had not been gone a year and a day, Strange countries for to see, When languishing thoughts came into his head, Lady Nancy Belle he would go see. 5 So he rode, and he rode, on his milk-white steed, Till he came to London town, And there he heard St Pancras bells, And the people all mourning round. 6 ‘Oh what is the matter?’ Lord Lovel he said, ‘Oh what is the matter?’ said he; ‘A lord's lady is dead,’ a woman replied, ‘And some call her Lady Nancy.’ 7 So he ordered the grave to be opened wide, And the shroud he turned down, And there he kissed her clay-cold lips, Till the tears came trickling down. 8 Lady Nancy she died, as it might be, today, Lord Lovel he died as tomorrow; Lady Nancy she died out of pure, pure grief, Lord Lovel he died out of sorrow. 9 Lady Nancy was laid in St. Pancras church, Lord Lovel was laid in the choir; And out of her bosom there grew a red rose, And out of her lover's a briar. 10 They grew, and they grew, to the church-steeple too, And then they could grow no higher; So there they entwined in a true-lover's knot, For all lovers true to admire. LORD LOVEL—I Percy Papers, communicated by Principal Robertson, the historian. 1 There came a ghost to Helen's bower, Wi monny a sigh and groan: ‘O make yourself ready, at Wednesday at een, Fair Helen, you must be gone.’ 2 ‘O gay Death, O gallant Death, Will you spare my life sae lang Untill I send to merry Primrose, Bid my dear lord come hame?’ 3 ‘O gay Helen, O galant Helen, I winna spare you sae lang; But make yoursell ready, again Wednesday at een, Fair Helen, you must be gane.’ 4 ‘O where will I get a bonny boy, That would win hose and shoon, That will rin fast to merry Primrose, Bid my dear lord come soon?’ 5 O up and speak a little boy, That would win hose and shoon: ‘Aft have I gane your errants, lady, But by my suth I'll rin.’ 6 When he came to broken briggs He bent his bow and swam, And when he came to grass growing He cast off his shoon and ran. 7 When he came to merry Primrose, His lord he was at meat: ‘O my lord, kend ye what I ken, Right little wad ye eat.’ 8 ‘Is there onny of my castles broken doun, Or onny of my towers won? Or is Fair Helen brought to bed Of a doughter or a son?’ 9 ‘There's nane of [your] castles broken doun, Nor nane of your towers won, Nor is Fair Helen brought to bed Of a doghter or a son.’ 10 ‘Gar sadle me the black, black steed, Gar sadle me the brown; Gar sadle me the swiftest horse Eer carried man to town.’ 11 First he bursted the bonny black, And then he bursted the brown, And then he bursted the swiftest steed Eer carried man to town. 12 He hadna ridden a mile, a mile, A mile but barelins ten, When he met four and twenty gallant knights, Carrying a dead coffin. 13 ‘Set down, set down Fair Helen's corps, Let me look on the dead;’ And out he took a little pen-knife, And he screeded the winding-sheet. 14 O first he kist her rosy cheek, And then he kist her chin, And then he kist her coral lips, But there's nae life in within. 15 ‘Gar deal, gar deal the bread,’ he says, ‘The bread bat an the wine, And at the morn at twelve o'clock Ye's gain as much at mine.’ 16 The tane was buried in Mary's kirk, The tother in Mary's choir, And out of the tane there sprang a birch, And out of the tother a briar. 17 The tops of them grew far sundry, But the roots of them grew neer, And ye may easy ken by that They were twa lovers dear.

Or is this Fair Isabell of Roch Royall, Banisht from kyth and kin.’ 7 ‘O I am not the first young may, That lighted and gaed in; Nor neither am I the second young may, That neer the sun shone on; 8 ‘But I'm Fair Isabell of Roch Royall Banisht from kyth and kin; I'm seeking my true-love Gregory, And I would I had him in.’ 9 ‘O go your way to yon castle, And ride it round about, And there you'll find Love Gregory; He's within, without any doubt.’ 10 O she's away to yon castle, She's tirled at the pin: ‘O open, open, Love Gregory, And let your true-love in.’ 11 ‘If you be the lass of the Rochroyall, As I trow not you be, You will tell me some of our love-tokens, That was betwixt you and me.’ 12 ‘Have you not mind, Love Gregory, Since we sat at the wine; When we changed the rings off our fingers, And ay the worst fell mine? 13 ‘Mine was of the massy gold, And thine was of the tin; Mine was true and trusty both, And thine was false within.’ 14 If you be [the] lass of the Roch Royall, As I trow not you be, You will tell me some other love-token That was betwixt you and me.’ 15 ‘Have you not mind, Love Gregory, Since we sat at the wine, We changed the smocks off our two backs, And ay the worst fell mine? 16 ‘Mine was of the holland fine, And thine was course and thin; So many blocks have we two made, And ay the worst was mine.’ 17 ‘Love Gregory, he is not at home, But he is to the sea; If you have any word to him, I pray you leave't with me.’ 18 ‘O who will shoe my bony foot? Or who will glove my hand? Or who will bind my midle jimp With the broad lilly band? 19 ‘Or who will comb my bony head With the red river comb? Or who will be my bairn's father Ere Gregory he come home?’ 20 ‘O I's gar shoe thy bony foot, And I's gar glove thy hand, And I's gar bind thy midle jimp With the broad lilly band. 21 ‘And I's gar comb thy bony head With the red river comb; But there is none to be thy bairn's father Till Love Gregory he come home. 22 ‘I'll set my foot on the ship-board, God send me wind and more! For there's never a woman shall bear a son Shall make my heart so sore.’ 23 ‘I dreamed a dream now since yestreen, That I never dreamed before; I dreamd that the lass of the Rochroyall Was knocking at the door.’ 24 ‘Ly still, ly still, my é dear son, Ly still, and take a sleep; For it's neither ane hour, nor yet a half, Since she went from the gate.’ 25 ‘O wo be to you, ill woman, And ane ill death mott you die! For you might have come to my bed-side, And then have wakened me. 26 ‘Gar sadle me the black,’ he sayes, ‘Gar sadle me the broun; Gar sadle me the swiftest steed That ever rode the toun. 27 ‘Gar shoe him with the beat silver, Gar grind him with the gold; Cause put two bells on every side, Till I come to some hold.’ 28 They sadled him the black, the black, So did they him the broun; So did they him the swiftest steed That ever rode to toun. 29 They shoed him with the beat silver, They grind him with the gold; They put two bells on every side, Till he came to some hold. 30 He had not rode a mile, a mile, A mile but barely three, Till that he spyed her comely corps Come raking oere the lee. 31 ‘Set doun, set doun these comely corps, Let me look on the dead:’ And out he's ta'en his little pen-knife, And slitted her winding sheet. 32 And first he kist her cheek, her cheek, And then he kist her chin; And then he kist her rosy lips, But there was no breath within. 33 ‘Gar deall, gar deall for my love sake The spiced bread and the wine; For ere the morn at this time So shall you deall for mine. 34 ‘Gar deall, gar deall for my love sake The pennys that are so small; For ere the morn at this time, So shall you deall for all.’ 35 The one was buried in Mary kirk, The other in Mary quire; Out of the one there sprung a birk, Out of the other a bryar; So thus you may well know by that They were two lovers dear. The Bonny Lass of Lochvoyan, or Lochvoyen THE LASS OF ROCH ROYAL—B Herd's MS, I, 144; II, 60, the first ten lines; Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 149. 1 ‘O wha will shoe thy bonny feet? Or wha will glove thy hand? Or wha will lace thy midle jimp, With a lang, lang London whang? 2 ‘And wha will kame thy bonny head, With a tabean brirben kame? And wha will be my bairn's father, Till Love Gregory come hame?’ 3 ‘Thy father'll shoe his bonny feet, Thy mither'll glove his hand; Thy brither will lace his middle jimp, With a lang, lang London whang. 4 ‘Mysel will kame his bonny head, With a tabean brirben kame; And the Lord will be the bairn's father, Till Love Gregory come hame.’ 5 Then she's gart build a bonny ship, It's a' cored oer with pearl, And at every needle-tack was in't There hang a siller bell. 6 And she's awa To sail upon the sea; She's gane to seek Love Gregory, In lands whereer he be. 7 She hadna saild a league but twa, O scantly had she three, Till she met with a rude rover, Was sailing on the sea. 8 ‘O whether is thou the Queen hersel, Or ane o her maries three? Or is thou the lass of Lochroyan, Seeking Love Gregory?’ 9 ‘O I am not the Queen hersell, Nor ane o her maries three; But I am the lass o Lochroyan, Seeking Love Gregory. 10 ‘O sees na thou yone bonny bower? It's a' cored oer with tin; When thou hast saild it round about, Love Gregory is within.’ 11 When she had saild it round about, She tirled at the pin: ‘O open, open, Love Gregory, Open, and let me in! For I am the lass of Lochroyan, Banisht frae a' my kin.’ 12 ‘If thou be the lass of Lochroyan, As I know no thou be, Tell me some of the true tokens That past between me and thee.’ 13 ‘Hast thou na mind, Love Gregory, As we sat at the wine, We changed the rings aff ither's hands, And ay the best was mine? 14 ‘For mine was o the gude red gould, But thine was o the tin; And mine was true and trusty baith, But thine was fa'se within. 15 ‘If thou be the lass of Lochroyan, As I know na thou be, Tell me some mair o the true tokens Past between me and thee.’ 16 ‘And has na thou na mind, Love Gregory, As we sat on yon hill, Thou twin'd me of my [maidenhead,] Right sair against my will? 17 ‘Now open, open, Love Gregory, Open, and let me in! For the rain rains on my gude cleading, And the dew stands on my chin.’ 18 Then she has turnd her round about: ‘Well, since that it be sae, Let never woman that has born a son Hae a heart sae full of wae. 19 ‘Take down, take down that mast o gould, Set up a mast of tree; For it dinna become a forsaken lady To sail so royallie.’ 20 ‘I dreamt a dream this night, mother, I wish it may prove true, That the bonny lass of Lochroyan Was at the gate just now.’ 21 ‘Lie still, lie still, my only son, And sound sleep mayst thou get, For it's but an hour or little mair Since she was at the gate.’ 22 Awa, awa, ye wicket woman, And an ill dead may ye die! Ye might have ither letten her in, Or else have wakened me. 23 ‘Gar saddle to me the black,’ he said, ‘Gar saddle to me the brown; Gar saddle to me the swiftest steed That is in a' the town.’ 24 Now the first town that he cam to, The bells were ringing there; And the neist toun that he cam to, Her corps was coming there. 25 ‘Set down, set down that comely corp, Set down, and let me see Gin that be the lass of Lochroyan, That died for love o me.’ 26 And he took out the little penknife That hang down by his gare, And he's rippd up her winding-sheet, A lang claith-yard and mair. 27 And first he kist her cherry cheek, And syne he kist her chin, And neist he kist her rosy lips; There was nae breath within. 28 And he has taen his little penknife, With a heart that was fou sair, He has given himself a deadly wound, And word spake never mair. Lord Gregory THE LASS OF ROCH ROYAL—C Pitcairn's MSS, III, 1, from the singing of Widow Stevenson. 1 She sailed west, she sailed east, She sailed mony a mile, Until she cam to Lord Gregor's yett, And she tirled at the pin. 2 ‘It's open, open, Lord Gregory, Open, and let me in; For the rain drops on my gouden hair, And drops upon your son.’ 3 ‘Are you the Queen of Queensberry? Or one of the marys three? Or are you the lass of Ruchlaw hill, Seeking Lord Gregory?’ 4 ‘I'm not the Queen of Queensberry, Nor one of the marys three; But I am the bonny lass of Ruchlawhill, Seeking Lord Gregory.’ 5 ‘Awa, awa, ye fause thief, I will not open to thee Till you tell me the first token That was tween you and me.’ 6 ‘Do not you mind, Lord Gregory, When we birled at the wine, We changed the rings of our fingers, And ay the best was mine? 7 ‘For mine was true and trusty goud, But yours it was of tin; Mine was of the true and trusty goud, But yours was fause within.’ 8 She turned about her bonny ship, Awa then did she sail: ‘The sun shall never shine on man That made my heart so sare.’ 9 Then up the old mother she got, And wakened Lord Gregory: ‘Awa, awa, ye fause gudeson, A limmer was seeking thee.’ 10 ‘It's woe be to you, witch-mother, An ill death may you die! For you might hae set the yet open, And then hae wakened me.’ 11 It's up he got, and put on his clothes, And to the yet he ran; The first sight of the ship he saw, He whistled and he sang. 12 But whan the bonny ship was out o sight, He clapped his hands and ran, 13 The first kirktoun he cam to, He heard the death-bell ring, The second kirktoun he cam to, He saw her corpse come in. 14 ‘Set down, set down this bonny corpse, That I may look upon; If she died late for me last night, I'll die for her the morn. 15 ‘Be merry, merry, gentlemen, Be merry at the bread and wine; For by the morn at this time o day You'll drink as much at mine.’ 16 The one was buried in Mary's isle, The other in Mary's quire; Out of the one there grew a thorn, And out of the other a brier. 17 And aye they grew, and aye they blew, Till their twa taps did meet; And every one that passed thereby Might see they were lovers sweet.

An wha will lace my middle gimp Wi the new made London ban? 2 ‘Or wha will kemb my yallow hair, Wi the new made silver kemb? Or wha'll be father to my young bairn, Till Love Gregor come hame?’ 3 Her father shoed her fu fair foot, Her mother glovd her han; Her sister lac'd her middle gimp Wi the new made London ban. 4 Her brother kembd her yallow hair, Wi the new made silver kemb, But the king o heaven maun father her bairn, Till Love Gregor come hame. 5 ‘O gin I had a bony ship, An men to sail wi me, It's I would gang to my true-love, Since he winna come to me.’ 6 Her father's gien her a bonny ship, An sent her to the stran; She's tane her young son in her arms, An turnd her back to the lan. 7 She had na been o the sea saillin About a month or more, Till landed has she her bonny ship Near her true-love's door. 8 The night was dark, an the win blew caul, An her love was fast asleep, An the bairn that was in her twa arms Fu sair began to weep. 9 Long stood she at her true-love's door, An lang tirld at the pin; At length up gat his fa'se mither, Says, Wha's that woud be in? 10 ‘O it is Anny of Roch-royal, Your love, come oer the sea, But an your young son in her arms; So open the door to me.’ 11 ‘Awa, awa, you ill woman, You've na come here for gude, You're but a witch, or wile warlock, Or mermaid o the flude.’ 12 ‘I'm na a witch, or wile warlock, Nor mermaiden,’ said she; ‘I'm but Fair Anny o Roch-royal; O open the door to me.’ 13 ‘O gin ye be Anny o Roch-royal, As [I] trust not ye be, What taiken can ye gie that ever I kept your company?’ 14 ‘O dinna ye mind, Love Gregor,’ she says, ‘Whan we sat at the wine, How we changed the napkins frae our necks, It's na sae lang sin syne? 15 ‘An yours was good, an good enough, But nae sae good as mine; For yours was o the cumbruk clear, But mine was silk sae fine. 16 ‘An dinna ye mind, Love Gregor,’ she says, ‘As we twa sat at dine, How we changed the rings frae our fingers, But ay the best was mine? 17 ‘For yours was good, an good enough, Yet nae sae good as mine; For yours was of the good red gold, But mine o the diamonds fine. 18 ‘Sae open the door now, Love Gregor, An open it wi speed, Or your young son that is in my arms For cauld will soon be dead.’ 19 ‘Awa, awa, you ill woman, Gae frae my door for shame; For I hae gotten another fair love, Sae ye may hye you hame.’ 20 ‘O hae you gotten another fair love, For a' the oaths you sware? Then fair you well now, fa'se Gregor, For me you's never see mair.’ 21 O heely, heely gi'd she back, As the day began to peep; She set her foot on good ship-board, An sair, sair did she weep. 22 Love Gregor started frae his sleep, An to his mither did say, I dreamd a dream this night, mither, That maks my heart right wae. 23 ‘I dreamd that Anny of Roch-royal, The flowr o a' her kin, Was standin mournin at my door, But nane would lat her in.’ 24 ‘O there was a woman stood at the door, Wi a bairn intill her arms, But I woud na lat her within the bowr, For fear she had done you harm.’ 25 O quickly, quickly raise he up, An fast ran to the stran, An there he saw her Fair Anny, Was sailin frae the lan. 26 An ‘Heigh, Anny!’ an ‘Hou, Anny! O Anny, speak to me!’ But ay the louder that he cried Anny, The louder roard the sea. 27 An ‘Heigh, Anny!’ an ‘Hou, Anny! O Anny, winna you bide?’ But ay the langer that he cried Anny, The higher roard the tide. 28 The win grew loud, an the sea grew rough, An the ship was rent in twain, An soon he saw her Fair Anny Come floating oer the main. 29 He saw his young son in her arms, Baith tossd aboon the tide; He wrang his hands, than fast he ran, An plung'd i the sea sae wide. 30 He catchd her by the yallow hair, An drew her to the strand, But cauld an stiff was every limb Before he reachd the land. 31 O first he kissd her cherry cheek, An then he kissd her chin; An sair he kissd her ruby lips, But there was nae breath within. 32 O he has mournd oer Fair Anny Till the sun was gaing down, Then wi a sigh his heart it brast, An his soul to heaven has flown.

And wha will lace my middle jimp, Wi the new made London band? 2 ‘And wha will kaim my yellow hair, Wi the new made silver kaim? And wha will father my young son, Till Love Gregor come hame?’ 3 ‘Your father will shoe your fu fair foot, Your mother will glove your hand; Your sister will lace your middle jimp Wi the new made London band. 4 ‘Your brother will kaim your yellow hair, Wi the new made silver kaim; And the king of heaven will father your bairn, Till Love Gregor come haim.’ 5 ‘But I will get a bonny boat, And I will sail the sea, For I maun gang to Love Gregor, Since he canno come hame to me.’ 6 O she has gotten a bonny boat, And sailld the sa't sea fame; She langd to see her ain true-love, Since he could no come hame. 7 ‘O row your boat, my mariners, And bring me to the land, For yonder I see my love's castle, Closs by the sa't sea strand.’ 8 She has taen her young son in her arms, And to the door she's gone, And lang she's knocked and sair she ca'd, But answer got she none. 9 ‘O open the door, Love Gregor,’ she says, ‘O open, and let me in; For the wind blaws thro my yellow hair, And the rain draps oer my chin.’ 10 ‘Awa, awa, ye ill woman, You'r nae come here for good; You'r but some witch, or wile warlock, Or mer-maid of the flood.’ 11 ‘I am neither a witch nor a wile warlock, Nor mer-maid of the sea, I am Fair Annie of Rough Royal; O open the door to me.’ 12 ‘Gin ye be Annie of Rough Royal — And I trust ye are not she — Now tell me some of the love-tokens That past between you and me.’ 13 ‘O dinna you mind now, Love Gregor, When we sat at the wine, How we changed the rings frae our fingers? And I can show thee thine. 14 ‘O yours was good, and good enneugh, But ay the best was mine; For yours was o the good red goud, But mine o the dimonds fine. 15 ‘But open the door now, Love Gregor, O open the door I pray, For your young son that is in my arms Will be dead ere it be day.’ 16 ‘Awa, awa, ye ill woman, For here ye shanno win in; Gae drown ye in the raging sea, Or hang on the gallows-pin.’ 17 When the cock had crawn, and day did dawn, And the sun began to peep, Then it raise him Love Gregor, And sair, sair did he weep. 18 ‘O I dreamd a dream, my mother dear, The thoughts o it gars me greet, That Fair Annie of Rough Royal Lay cauld dead at my feet.’ 19 ‘Gin it be for Annie of Rough Royal That ye make a' this din, She stood a' last night at this door, But I trow she wan no in.’ 20 ‘O wae betide ye, ill woman, An ill dead may ye die! That ye woudno open the door to her, Nor yet woud waken me.’ 21 O he has gone down to yon shore-side, As fast as he could fare; He saw Fair Annie in her boat, But the wind it tossd her sair. 22 And ‘Hey, Annie!’ and ‘How, Annie! O Annie, winna ye bide?’ But ay the mair that he cried Annie, The braider grew the tide. 23 And ‘Hey, Annie!’ and ‘How, Annie! Dear Annie, speak to me!’ But ay the louder he cried Annie, The louder roard the sea. 24 The wind blew loud, the sea grew rough, And dashd the boat on shore; Fair Annie floats on the raging sea, But her young son raise no more. 25 Love Gregor tare his yellow hair, And made a heavy moan; Fair Annie's corpse lay at his feet, But his bonny young son was gone. 26 O cherry, cherry was her cheek, And gowden was her hair, But clay cold were her rosey lips, Nae spark of life was there. 27 And first he's kissd her cherry cheek, And neist he's kissed her chin; And saftly pressd her rosey lips, But there was nae breath within. 28 ‘O wae betide my cruel mother, And an ill dead may she die! For she turnd my true-love frae my door, When she came sae far to me.’ THE LASS OF ROCH ROYAL—F Herd MS., I, 31, II, 65. 1 ‘O wha will lace my steys, mother? O wha will gluve my hand?

Or is't my true-love, Willy, From Scotland new come home?’ 3 ‘'Tis not thy father Philip, Nor yet thy brother John; But 'tis thy true-love, Willy, From Scotland new come home. 4 ‘O sweet Margret, O dear Margret, I pray thee speak to me; Give me my faith and troth, Margret, As I gave it to thee.’ 5 ‘Thy faith and troth thou's never get, Nor yet will I thee lend, Till that thou come within my bower, And kiss my cheek and chin.’ 6 ‘If I shoud come within thy bower, I am no earthly man; And shoud I kiss thy rosy lips, Thy days will not be lang. 7 ‘O sweet Margret, O dear Margret, I pray thee speak to me; Give me my faith and troth, Margret, As I gave it to thee.’ 8 ‘Thy faith and troth thou's never get, Nor yet will I thee lend, Till you take me to yon kirk, And wed me with a ring.’ 9 ‘My bones are buried in yon kirk-yard, Afar beyond the sea, And it is but my spirit, Margret, That's now speaking to thee.’ 10 She stretchd out her lilly-white hand, And, for to do her best, ‘Hae, there's your faith and troth, Willy, God send your soul good rest.’ 11 Now she has kilted her robes of green A piece below her knee, And a' the live-lang winter night The dead corp followed she. 12 ‘Is there any room at your head, Willy? Or any room at your feet? Or any room at your side, Willy, Wherein that I may creep?’ 13 ‘There's no room at my head, Margret, There's no room at my feet; There's no room at my side, Margret, My coffin's made so meet.’ 14 Then up and crew the red, red cock, And up then crew the gray: ‘Tis time, tis time, my dear Margret, That you were going away.’ 15 No more the ghost to Margret said, But, with a grievous groan, Evanishd in a cloud of mist, And left her all alone. 16 ‘O stay, my only true-love, stay,’ The constant Margret cry'd; Wan grew her cheeks, she closd her een, Stretchd her soft limbs, and dy'd.

Give me my faith and trouthe again, A wat, trew-love, I gied to thee.’ 3 ‘Your faith and trouth ye's never get, Nor our trew love shall never twain, Till ye come with me in my bower, And kiss me both cheek and chin.’ 4 ‘My mouth it is full cold, Margret, It has the smell now of the ground; And if I kiss thy comely mouth, Thy life-days will not be long. 5 ‘Cocks are crowing a merry mid-larf, I wat the wild fule boded day; Gie me my faith and trouthe again, And let me fare me on my way.’ 6 ‘Thy faith and trouth thou shall na get, Nor our trew love shall never twin, Till ye tell me what comes of women Awat that dy's in strong traveling.’ 7 ‘Their beds are made in the heavens high, Down at the foot of our good Lord's knee, Well set about wi gilly-flowers, A wat sweet company for to see. 8 ‘O cocks are crowing a merry midd-larf, A wat the wilde foule boded day; The salms of Heaven will be sung, And ere now I'le be misst away.’ 9 Up she has tain a bright long wand, And she has straked her trouth thereon; She has given [it] him out at the shot-window, Wi many a sad sigh and heavy groan. 10 ‘I thank you, Margret, I thank you, Margret, And I thank you hartilie; Gine ever the dead come for the quick, Be sure, Margret, I'll come again for thee.’ 11 It's hose an shoon an gound alane She clame the wall and followed him, Untill she came to a green forest, On this she lost the sight of him. 12 ‘Is their any room at your head, Sanders?

Or are you my true-love, Sweet William, From England newly come?’ 3 ‘I'm not your father, the king,’ he says, ‘No, no, nor your brother John; But I'm your true love, Sweet William, From England that's newly come.’ 4 ‘Have ye brought me any scarlets so red? Or any silks so fine? Or have ye brought me any precious things, That merchants have for sale?’ 5 ‘I have not brought you any scarlets sae red, No, no, nor the silks so fine; But I have brought you my winding-sheet, Oer many's the rock and hill. 6 ‘O Lady Marjory, Lady Marjory, For faith and charitie, Will you give to me my faith and troth, That I gave once to thee?’ 7 ‘O your faith and troth I'll not give thee, No, no, that will not I, Until I get one kiss of your ruby lips, And in my arms you come [lye].’ 8 ‘My lips they are so bitter,’ he says, ‘My breath it is so strong, If you get one kiss of my ruby lips, Your days will not be long. 9 ‘The cocks they are crowing, Marjory,’ he says, ‘The cocks they are crawing again; It's time the deid should part the quick, Marjorie, I must be gane.’ 10 She followed him high, she followed him low, Till she came to yon church-yard; O there the grave did open up, And young William he lay down. 11 ‘What three things are these, Sweet William,’ she says, ‘That stands here at your head?’ ‘It's three maidens, Marjorie,’ he says, ‘That I promised once to wed.’ 12 ‘What three things are these, Sweet William,’ she says, ‘That stands here at your side?’ ‘It is three babes, Marjorie,’ he says, ‘That these three maidens had.’ 13 ‘What three things are these, Sweet William,’ she says, ‘That stands here at your feet?’ It is three hell-hounds, Marjorie,’ he says, ‘That's waiting my soul to keep.’ 14 She took up her white, white hand, And she struck him in the breast, Saying, Have there again your faith and troth, And I wish your soul good rest.

Or are ye my true-love, Willie, Frae London new come home?’ 3 ‘I'm nae your father Philip, Nor am I your brother John; But I am your true-love, Willie, An I'm nae a levin man. 4 ‘But gie me my faith and troth, Margrat, An let me pass on my way; For the bells o heaven will be rung, An I'll be mist away.’ 5 ‘Yere faith and troth ye'se never get, Till ye tell me this ane; Till ye tell me where the women go That hang themsell for sin.’ 6 ‘O they gang till the low, low hell, Just by the devil's knee; It's a' clad ower wi burnin pitch, A dreadfu sicht to see.’ 7 ‘But your faith and troth ye'se never get, Till you tell me again; Till you tell me where the children go That die without a name.’ 8 ‘O they gang till the high, high heaven, Just by our Saviour's knee, An it's a' clad ower wi roses red, A lovelie sicht to see. 9 ‘But gie me my faith and troth, Margrat, And let me pass on my way; For the psalms o heaven will be sung, An I'll be mist away.’ 10 ‘But your faith and troth yese never get Till ye tell me again; Till ye tell me where the women go That die in child-beddin.’ 11 ‘O they gang till the hie, hie heaven, Just by our Saviour's knee, And every day at twal o clock They're dipped oer the head. 12 ‘But gie me my faith and troth, Margret, And let me pass on my way; For the gates o heaven will be shut, And I'll be mist away.’ 13 Then she has taen a silver key, Gien him three times on the breast; Says, There's your faith and troth, Willie, I hope your soul will rest. 14 ‘But is there room at your head, Willie? Or is there room at your feet?

O is it my mother? Or is it my brother John? Or is it Sweet William, my ain true-love, To Scotland new come home?’ 3 ‘It is na your father, it is na your mother, It is na your brother John; But it is Sweet William, your ain true-love, To Scotland new come home.’ 4 ‘Hae ye brought me onie fine things, Onie new thing for to wear? Or hae ye brought me a braid o lace, To snood up my gowden hair?’ 5 ‘I've brought ye na fine things at all, Nor onie new thing to wear, Nor hae I brought ye a braid of lace, To snood up your gowden hair. 6 ‘But Margaret, dear Margaret, I pray ye speak to me; O gie me back my faith and troth, As dear as I gied it thee.’ 7 ‘Your faith and troth ye sanna get, Nor will I wi ye twin, Till ye come within my bouer, And kiss me, cheek and chin.’ 8 ‘O should I come within your bouer, I am na earthly man; If I should kiss your red, red lips, Your days wad na be lang. 9 ‘O Margaret, dear Margaret, I pray ye speak to me; O gie me back my faith and troth, As dear as I gied it thee.’ 10 ‘Your faith and troth ye sanna get, Nor will I wi ye twin, Till ye tak me to yonder kirk, And wed me wi a ring.’ 11 ‘My banes are buried in yon kirk-yard, It's far ayont the sea; And it is my spirit, Margaret, That's speaking unto thee.’ 12 ‘Your faith and troth ye sanna get, Nor will I twin wi thee, Till ye tell me the pleasures o heaven, And pains of hell how they be.’ 13 ‘The pleasures of heaven I wat not of, But the pains of hell I dree; There some are hie hangd for huring, And some for adulterie.’ 14 Then Margret took her milk-white hand, And smoothd it on his breast: ‘Tak your faith and troth, William, God send your soul good rest!’ SWEET WILLIAM'S GHOST—F Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 83, stanzas 26 ff. 1 When seven years were come and gane, Lady Margaret she thought lang; And she is up to the hichest tower, By the lee licht o the moon. 2 She was lookin oer her castle high, To see what she might fa, And there she saw a grieved ghost, Comin waukin oer the wa. 3 ‘O are ye a man of mean,’ she says, ‘Seekin ony o my meat? Or are you a rank robber, Come in my bower to break?’ 4 ‘O I'm Clerk Saunders, your true-love, Behold, Margaret, and see, And mind, for a' your meikle pride, Sae will become of thee.’ 5 ‘Gin ye be Clerk Saunders, my true-love, This meikle marvels me; O wherein is your bonny arms, That wont to embrace me?’ 6 ‘By worms they're eaten, in mools they're rotten, Behold, Margaret, and see, And mind, for a' your mickle pride, Sae will become o thee.’ 7 O, bonny, bonny sang the bird, Sat on the coil o hay; But dowie, dowie was the maid That followd the corpse o clay. 8 ‘Is there ony room at your head, Saunders? Is there ony room at your feet? Is there ony room at your twa sides, For a lady to lie and sleep?’ 9 ‘There is nae room at my head, Margaret, As little at my feet; There is nae room at my twa sides, For a lady to lie and sleep. 10 ‘But gae hame, gae hame now, May Margaret, Gae hame and sew your seam; For if ye were laid in your weel made bed, Your days will nae be lang.’ SWEET WILLIAM'S GHOST—G Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 183, ed. 1833, the last three stanzas. 1 ‘But plait a wand o bonny birk, And lay it on my breast, And shed a tear upon my grave, And wish my saul gude rest. 2 ‘And fair Margret, and rare Margret, And Margret o veritie, Gin eer ye love another man, Neer love him as ye did me.’ 3 Then up and crew the milk-white cock, And up and crew the grey; The lover vanishd in the air, And she gaed weeping away. 78 THE UNQUIET GRAVE The Unquiet Grave THE UNQUIET GRAVE—A Communicated to the Folk Lore Record, I, 60, by Miss Charlotte Latham, as written down from the lips of a girl in Sussex. 1 ‘The wind doth blow today, my love, And a few small drops of rain; I never had but one true-love, In cold grave she was lain. 2 ‘I'll do as much for my true-love As any young man may; I'll sit and mourn all at her grave For a twelvemonth and a day.’ 3 The twelvemonth and a day being up, The dead began to speak: ‘Oh who sits weeping on my grave, And will not let me sleep?’ 4 ‘'Tis I, my love, sits on your grave, And will not let you sleep; For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips, And that is all I seek.’ 5 ‘You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips; But my breath smells earthy strong; If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips, Your time will not be long. 6 ‘'Tis down in yonder garden green, Love, where we used to walk, The finest flower that ere was seen Is withered to a stalk. 7 ‘The stalk is withered dry, my love, So will our hearts decay; So make yourself content, my love, Till God calls you away.’ THE UNQUIET GRAVE—B Notes and Queries, Fifth Series, VII, 436, cited by W.

For you will not let me sleep.’ 4 ‘It is not your gold I want, dear love, Nor yet your wealth I crave; But one kiss from your lily-white lips Is all I wish to have. 5 ‘Your lips are cold as clay, dear love, Your breath doth smell so strong;’ ‘I am afraid, my pretty, pretty maid, Your time will not be long.’ THE UNQUIET GRAVE—C “From a yeoman in Suffolk, who got it from his nurse;” B.

Or is any of thy good friends dead, Which makes thee shed such teares? 11 ‘Or if it be my head-kookes-man, Greiued againe he shalbe, Nor noe man within my howse Shall doe wrong vnto thee.’ 12 ‘But it is not your head-kookes-man, Nor none of his degree; But [f]or to morrow, ere it be noone, You are deemed to die. 13 ‘And of that thanke your head-steward, And after, your gay ladie:’ ‘If it be true, my litle foote-page, Ile make thee heyre of all my land.’ 14 ‘If it be not true, my deare master, God let me neuer thye:’ ‘If it be not true, thou litle foot-page, A dead corse shalt thou be.’ 15 He called downe his head-kookes-man, Cooke in kitchen super to dresse: ‘All and anon, my deare master, Anon att your request.’ 16 ‘And call you downe my faire lady, This night to supp with mee.’ 17 And downe then came that fayre lady, Was cladd all in purple and palle; The rings that were vpon her fingers Cast light thorrow the hall. 18 ‘What is your will, my owne wed lord, What is your will with mee?’ ‘I am sicke, fayre lady, Sore sicke, and like to dye.’ 19 ‘But and you be sicke, my owne wed lord, Soe sore it greiueth mee; But my fiue maydens and my selfe Will goe and make your bedd. 20 ‘And at the wakening of your first sleepe You shall haue a hott drinke made, And at the wakening of your next sleepe Your sorrowes will haue a slake.’ 21 He put a silke cote on his backe, Was thirteen inches folde, And put a steele cap vpon his head, Was gilded with good red gold. 22 And he layd a bright browne sword by his side, And another att his ffeete, And full well knew Old Robin then Whether he shold wake or sleepe. 23 And about the middle time of the night Came twenty four good knights in; Sir Gyles he was the formost man, Soe well he knew that ginne. 24 Old Robin, with a bright browne sword, Sir Gyles head he did winne; Soe did he all those twenty four, Neuer a one went quicke out [agen]. 25 None but one litle foot-page, Crept forth at a window of stone, And he had two armes when he came in, And [when he went out he had none]. 26 Vpp then came that ladie light, With torches burning bright; Shee thought to haue brought Sir Gyles a drinke, But shee found her owne wedd knight. 27 And the first thinge that this ladye stumbled vpon Was of Sir Gyles his ffoote; Sayes, Euer alacke, and woe is me, Here lyes my sweete hart-roote! 28 And the second thing that this ladie stumbled on Was of Sir Gyles his head; Sayes, Euer alacke, and woe is me, Heere lyes my true-loue deade! 29 Hee cutt the papps beside he[r] brest, And bad her wish her will; And he cutt the eares beside her heade, And bade her wish on still. 30 ‘Mickle is the mans blood I haue spent, To doe thee and me some good;’ Sayes, Euer alacke, my fayre lady, I thinke that I was woode! 31 He calld then vp his litle foote-page, And made him heyre of all his land, 32 And he shope the crosse in his right sholder, Of the white flesh and the redd, And he went him into the holy land, Wheras Christ was quicke and dead. 81 LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD Little Musgrave and the Lady Barnard LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—A a.

Wit and Drollery, 1682, p. 81. 1 As it fell one holy-day, Hay downe As many be in the yeare, When young men and maids together did goe, Their mattins and masse to heare, 2 Little Musgrave came to the church-dore; The preist was at private masse; But he had more minde of the faire women Then he had of our lady['s] grace. 3 The one of them was clad in green, Another was clad in pall, And then came in my lord Bernard's wife, The fairest amonst them all. 4 She cast an eye on Little Musgrave, As bright as the summer sun; And then bethought this Little Musgrave, This lady's heart have I woonn. 5 Quoth she, I have loved thee, Little Musgrave, Full long and many a day; ‘So have I loved you, fair lady, Yet never word durst I say.’ 6 ‘I have a bower at Buckelsfordbery, Full daintyly it is deight; If thou wilt wend thither, thou Little Musgrave, Thou's lig in mine armes all night.’ 7 Quoth he, I thank yee, faire lady, This kindnes thou showest to me; But whether it be to my weal or woe, This night I will lig with thee. 8 With that he heard, a little tynë page, By his ladye's coach as he ran: ‘All though I am my ladye's foot-page, Yet I am Lord Barnard's man. 9 ‘My lord Barnard shall knowe of this, Whether I sink or swim;’ And ever where the bridges were broake He laid him downe to swimme. 10 ‘A sleepe or wake, thou Lord Barnard, As thou art a man of life, For Little Musgrave is at Bucklesfordbery, A bed with thy own wedded wife.’ 11 ‘If this be true, thou little tinny page, This thing thou tellest to me, Then all the land in Bucklesfordbery I freely will give to thee. 12 ‘But if it be a ly, thou little tinny page, This thing thou tellest to me, On the hyest tree in Bucklesfordbery Then hanged shalt thou be.’ 13 He called up his merry men all: ‘Come saddle me my steed; This night must I to Buckellsfordbery, For I never had greater need.’ 14 And some of them whistld, and some of them sung, And some these words did say, And ever when my lord Barnard's horn blew, ‘Away, Musgrave, away!’ 15 ‘Methinks I hear the thresel-cock, Methinks I hear the jaye; Methinks I hear my lord Barnard, And I would I were away.’ 16 ‘Lye still, lye still, thou Little Musgrave, And huggell me from the cold; 'Tis nothing but a shephard's boy, A driving his sheep to the fold. 17 ‘Is not thy hawke upon a perch? Thy steed eats oats and hay; And thou a fair lady in thine armes, And wouldst thou bee away?’ 18 With that my lord Barnard came to the dore, And lit a stone upon; He plucked out three silver keys, And he opend the dores each one. 19 He lifted up the coverlett, He lifted up the sheet: ‘How now, how now, thou Littell Musgrave, Doest thou find my lady sweet?’ 20 ‘I find her sweet,’ quoth Little Musgrave, ‘The more 'tis to my paine; I would gladly give three hundred pounds That I were on yonder plaine.’ 21 ‘Arise, arise, thou Littell Musgrave, And put thy clothës on; It shall nere be said in my country I have killed a naked man. 22 ‘I have two swords in one scabberd, Full deere they cost my purse; And thou shalt have the best of them, And I will have the worse.’ 23 The first stroke that Little Musgrave stroke, He hurt Lord Barnard sore; The next stroke that Lord Barnard stroke, Little Musgrave nere struck more. 24 With that bespake this faire lady, In bed whereas she lay: ‘Although thou'rt dead, thou Little Musgrave, Yet I for thee will pray. 25 ‘And wish well to thy soule will I, So long as I have life; So will I not for thee, Barnard, Although I am thy wedded wife.’ 26 He cut her paps from off her brest; Great pitty it was to see That some drops of this ladie's heart's blood Ran trickling downe her knee. 27 ‘Woe worth you, woe worth, my mery men all You were nere borne for my good; Why did you not offer to stay my hand, When you see me wax so wood? 28 ‘For I have slaine the bravest sir knight That ever rode on steed; So have I done the fairest lady That ever did woman's deed. 29 ‘A grave, a grave,’ Lord Barnard cryd, ‘To put these lovers in; But lay my lady on the upper hand, For she came of the better kin.’ LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—B Percy MS., p. 53, Hales and Furnivall, I, 119. 1 ‘Ffor this same night att [Bucklesfeildberry] Litle Musgreue is in bed with thy wife.’ 2 ‘If it be trew, thou litle foote-page, This tale thou hast told to mee, Then all my lands in Buckle[s]feildberry I'le freely giue to thee. 3 ‘But if this be a lye, thou little foot-page, This tale thou hast told to mee, Then on the highest tree in Bucklesfeildberry All hanged that thou shalt bee.’ 4 Saies, Vpp and rise, my merrymen all, And saddle me my good steede, For I must ride to Bucklesfeildberry; God wott I had neuer more need! 5 But some they whistled, and some thé sunge, And some they thus cold say, When euer as Lord Barnetts horne blowes, ‘Away, Musgreue, away!’ 6 ‘Mie thinkes I heare the throstlecocke, Me thinkes I heare the iay, Me thinkes I heare Lord Barnetts horne, Away, Musgreue, away!’ 7 ‘But lie still, lie still, Litle Musgreue, And huddle me from the cold, For it is but some sheaperds boy, Is whistling sheepe ore the mold. 8 ‘Is not thy hauke vpon a pearch, Thy horsse eating corne and hay? And thou, a gay lady in thine armes, And yett thou wold goe away!’ 9 By this time Lord Barnett was come to the dore, And light vpon a stone, And he pulled out three silver kayes, And opened the dores euery one. 10 And first he puld the couering downe, And then puld downe the sheete; Saies, How now? How now, Litle Musgreue? Dost find my gay lady sweet? 11 ‘I find her sweete,’ saies Litle Musgreue, ‘The more is my greefe and paine;’ 12 ‘Soe haue I done the fairest lady That euer wore womans weede. 13 ‘Soe haue I done a heathen child, Which ffull sore greiueth mee, For which Ile repent all the dayes of my life, And god be with them all three!’ Little Mousgrove and the Lady Barnet LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—C a.

Or is my gay ladie broucht to bed, Of a dochter or a son?’ 12 ‘There is nane o your castles brunt, Nor nane o your towrs won; Nor is your gay ladie broucht to bed, Of a dochter or a son. 13 ‘But Little Musgrave, that gay young man, Is in bed wi your ladie, 14 ‘If this be true ye tell to me, It's goud sall be your fee; But if it be fause ye tell to me, I'se hang ye on a tree.’ 15 Whan they cam to yon water-side, They smoothd their breists and swam; And whan they cam to gerss growing, They set doun their feet and ran. 16 ‘How do ye like my sheets?’ he said, ‘How do ye like my bed? And how do ye like my gay ladie, Wha's lying at your side?’ 17 ‘O I do like your sheets,’ he said, ‘Sae do I like your bed; But mair do I like your gay ladie, Wha's lying at my side.’ 18 ‘Get up, get up, young man,’ he said, ‘Get up as swith's ye can; Let it never be said that Lord Barnard Slew in bed a nakit man.’ 19 ‘How do ye like his bluidy cheeks?

For he's awa to the green wood, As hard as he can flee. 10 And whan he to the green wood cam, 'Twas dark as dark could bee, And he fand his maister and his men Asleep aneth a tree. 11 ‘Rise up, rise up, maister,’ he said, ‘Rise up, and speak to me; Your wife's in bed wi Wee Messgrove, Rise up richt speedilie.’ 12 ‘Gin that be true ye tell to me, A lord I will mak thee; But gin it chance to be a lie, Sure hanged ye sall be.’ 13 ‘It is as true, my lord,’ he said, ‘As ever ye were born; Messgrove's asleep in your lady's bed, All for to keep her warm.’ 14 He mounted on his milk-white steed, He was ane angry man; And he reachd his stately castell gate Just as the day did dawn. 15 He put his horn unto his mouth, And he blew strong blasts three; Sayin, He that's in bed with anither man's wife, He suld be gaun awa. 16 Syne out and spak the Wee Messgrove, A frichtit man was he; ‘I hear Lord Barnard's horn,’ he said, ‘It blaws baith loud and hie.’ 17 ‘Lye still, lye still, my Wee Messgrove, And keep me frae the cauld; 'Tis but my father's shepherd's horn, A sounding in the fauld.’ 18 He put his horn unto his mouth, And he blew loud blasts three; Saying, He that's in bed wi anither man's wife, 'Tis time he was awa. 19 Syne out and spak the Wee Messgrove, A frichtit man was he: ‘Yon surely is Lord Barnard's horn, And I maun een gae flee.’ 20 ‘Lye still, lye still, Messgrove,’ she said, ‘And keep me frae the cauld; 'Tis but my father's shepherd's horn, A sounding in the fauld.’ 21 And ay Lord Barnard blew and blew, Till he was quite wearie; Syne he threw down his bugle horn, And up the stair ran he. 22 ‘How do you like my blankets, Sir? How do you like my sheets? How do ye like my gay ladie, That lies in your arms asleep?’ 23 ‘Oh weel I like your blankets, Sir, And weel I like your sheet; But wae be to your gay ladie, That lyes in my arms asleep!’ 24 ‘I'll gie you ae sword, Messgrove, And I will take anither; What fairer can I do, Messgrove, Altho ye war my brither?’ 25 The firsten wound that Messgrove gat, It woundit him richt sair; And the second wound that Messgrove gat, A word he neer spak mair. 26 ‘Oh how do ye like his cheeks, ladie? Or how do ye like his chin? Or how do ye like his fair bodie, That there's nae life within?’ 27 ‘Oh weel I like his cheeks,’ she said, ‘And weel I like his chin; And weel I like his fair bodie, That there's nae life within.’ 28 ‘Repeat these words, my fair ladie, Repeat them ower agane, And into a basin of pure silver I'll gar your heart's bluid rin.’ 29 ‘Oh weel I like his cheeks,’ she said, ‘And weel I like his chin; And better I like his fair bodie Than a' your kith and kin.’ 30 Syne he took up his gude braid sword, That was baith sharp and fine, And into a basin of pure silver Her heart's bluid he gart rin. 31 ‘O wae be to my merrie men, And wae be to my page, That they didna hald my cursed hands When I was in a rage!’ 32 He leand the halbert on the ground, The point o 'tto his breast, Saying, Here are three sauls gaun to heaven, I hope they'll a' get rest. Little Musgrave LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—H Motherwell's MS., p. 120. 1 Little Musgrove is to the church gone, Some ladies for to sply; Doun came one drest in black, And one came drest in brown, And down and came Lord Barlibas' lady, The fairest in a' the town. 2 ‘I know by the ring that's on your finger That you'r my Lord Barlibas' lady:’ ‘Indeed I am the Lord Barlibas' lady, And what altho I bee?’ 3 ‘Money shall be your hire, foot-page, And gold shall be your fee; You must not tell the secrets That's between Musgrove and me.’ 4 ‘Money shall not be hire,’ he said, ‘Nor gold shall be my fee; But I'll awa to my own liege lord, With the tidings you've told to me.’ 5 When he cam to the broken brig, He coost aff his clothes and he swimd, And when he cam to Lord Barlibas' yett, He tirled at the pin. 6 ‘What news, what news, my little foot-page? What news have ye brocht to me? Is my castle burnt?’ he said, ‘Or is my tower tane? Or is my lady lighter yet, Of a daughter or son?’ 7 ‘Your castle is not burnt,’ he says, ‘Nor yet is your tower tane, Nor yet is your lady brocht to bed, Of a daughter or a son; But Little Musgrove is lying wi her, Till he thinks it is time to be gane.’ 8 ‘O if the news be a lie,’ he says, ‘That you do tell unto me, I'll ca up a gallows to my yard-yett, And hangd on it thou shallt be. 9 ‘But if the news be true,’ he says, ‘That you do tell unto me, I have a young fair dochter at hame, Weel wedded on her you shall be.’ 10 He called upon his merry men, By thirties and by three: ‘Put aff the warst, put on the best, And come along with me.’ 11 He put a horn to his mouth, And this he gard it say: ‘The man that's in bed wi Lord Barlibas' lady, It's time he were up and away.’ 12 ‘What does yon trumpet mean?’ he sayd, ‘Or what does yon trumpet say? I think it says, the man that's in bed wi Lord Barlibas' lady, It's time he were up and away.’ 13 ‘O lie you still, my Little Musgrove, And cover me from the cold, For it is but my father's sheepherd, That's driving his sheep to the fold.’ 14 In a little while after that, Up started good Lord Barlibas, At Little Musgrove his feet. 15 ‘How do you like my blankets?’ he says, ‘Or how do you like my sheets? Or how do you like mine own fair lady, That lies in your arms and sleeps?’ 16 ‘I like your blankets very well, And far better your sheets; But woe be to this wicked woman, That lies in my arms and sleeps!’ 17 ‘Rise up, rise up, my Little Musgrove, Rise up, and put your clothes on; It's neer be said on no other day That I killed a naked man. 18 ‘There is two swords in my chamber, I wot they cost me dear; Take you the best, give me the warst, We'll red the question here.’ 19 The first stroke that Lord Barlibas struck, He dang Little Musgrove to the ground; The second stroke that Lord Barlibas gave Dang his lady in a deadly swound. 20 ‘Gar mak, gar mak a coffin,’ he says, ‘Gar mak it wide and long, And lay my lady at the right hand, For she's come of the noblest kin.’ Little Sir Grove LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—I Motherwell's MS., p. 305, from the recitation of Rebecca Dunse, 4th May, 1825: one of her mother's songs, an old woman. 1 ‘It's gold shall be your hire,’ she says, ‘And silver shall be your fee, If you will keep the secrets Between Little Sir Grove and me.’ 2 ‘Tho gold should be my hire,’ he says, ‘And silver should be my fee, It's I'll not keep the secret Betwixt Little Sir Grove and thee.’ 3 Up he rose, and away he goes, And along the plain he ran, And when he came to Lord Bengwill's castle, He tinkled at the pin; And who was sae ready as Lord Bengwill himsell To let this little page in. 4 ‘Is any of my towers burnt?’ he said, ‘Or any of my castles taen? Or is Lady Bengwill brought to bed, Of a daughter or a son?’ 5 ‘It's nane of your towers are burnt,’ he said, ‘Nor nane of your castles taen; But Lady Bengwill and Little Sir Grove To merry bed they are gane.’ 6 ‘If this be true that you tell me, Rewarded you shall be; And if it's a lie that you tell me, You shall be hanged before your ladie's ee. 7 ‘Get saddled to me the black,’ he says, ‘Get saddled to me the brown; Get saddled to me the swiftest steed That ever man rode on.’ 8 The firsten town that he came to, He blew baith loud and schill, And aye the owre-word o the tune Was, ‘Sir Grove, I wish you well.’ 9 The nexten town that he came to, He blew baith loud and long, And aye the owre-word of the tune Was ‘Sir Grove, it is time to be gone.’ 10 ‘Is yon the sound of the hounds?’ he says, ‘Or is yon the sound of the deer? But I think it's the sound of my brother's horn, That sounds sae schill in my ear.’ 11 ‘Lye still, lye still, Sir Grove,’ she says, ‘And keep a fair lady from cold; It's but the sound of my father's herd-boys, As they're driving the sheep to the fold.’ 12 They lay down in each other's arms, And they fell fast asleep, And neer a one of them did wake Till Lord Bengwill stood at their feet. 13 ‘How do you love my soft pillow? Or how do you love my sheets? Or how do you love my fair lady, That lies in your arms and sleeps?’ 14 ‘Full well I love your soft pillow, Far better I love your sheets; But woe be to your fair lady, That lies in my arms and sleeps!’ 15 ‘Rise up, rise up, Sir Grove,’ he says, ‘Some clothes there put you upon; Let it never be said in fair England I fought with a naked man.’ 16 ‘Oh where shall I go, or where shall I fly, Or where shall I run for my life? For you've got two broadswords into your hand, And I have never a knife.’ 17 ‘You shall take the one sword,’ he says, ‘And I shall take the other, And that is as fair I'm sure to day As that you are my born brother.’ 18 ‘Hold your hand, hold your hand, my brother dear, You've wounded me full sore; You may get a mistress in every town, But a brother you'll never get more.’ 19 The very first stroke that Lord Bengwill gave him, He wounded him full sore; The very next stroke that Lord Bengwill gave him, A word he never spoke more. 20 He's lifted up Lady Bengwill, And set her on his knee, Saying, Whether do you love Little Sir Grove Better than you do me? 21 ‘Full well I love your cherry cheeks, Full well I love your chin, But better I love Little Sir Grove, where he lies, Than you and all your kin.’ 22 ‘A grave, a grave,’ Lord Bengwill cried, ‘To put these lovers in, And put Lady Bengwill uppermost, For she's come of the noblest kin.’ Lord Barnabas' Lady LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—J Motherwell's MS., p. 371, from the recitation of Agnes Lyle, Kilbarchan. 1 Four and twenty ladies fair Was playing at the ba, And out cam the lady, Barnabas' lady, The flower amang them a'. 2 She coost an ee on Little Mossgrey, As brisk as any sun, And he coost anither on her again, And they thocht the play was won. 3 ‘What would you think, Little Mossgrey, To lye wi me this nicht? Good beds I hae in Barnabey, If they were ordered richt.’ 4 ‘Hold thy tongue, fair lady,’ he says, ‘For that would cause much strife; For I see by the rings on your fingers That you're Lord Barnabas' wife.’ 5 ‘Lord Barnabas' lady indeed I am, And that I'll let you ken, But he's awa to the king's court, And I hope he'll neer come hame.’ 6 Wi wrapped arms in bed they lay Till they fell both asleep, When up and starts Barnabas' boy, And stood at their bed-feet. 7 ‘How likes thou the bed, Mossgrey? Or how likes thou the sheets? Or how likes thou my master's lady, Lyes in thy arms and sleeps?’ 8 ‘Weel I love the bed,’ he said, ‘And far better the sheets; But foul may fa your master's lady, Lies in my arms and sleeps!’ 9 She pulled out a rusty sword, Was sticking by the stroe; Says, Tell no tidings of me, my boy, Or thou'll neer tell no moe. 10 He's awa to the king's court, As fast as he can dree; He's awa to the king's court, For to tell Barnaby. 11 ‘Are there any of my biggins brunt? Or any of my young men slain? Or is my lady brocht to bed, Of a dochter or a son?’ 12 ‘There is none of your biggings brunt, There's none of your young men slain; But Little Mossgrey and your lady They are both in a bed within.’ 13 ‘If that be true, my bonnie boy, Thou tellest unto me, I have not a dochter but only one, And married ye shall be. 14 ‘But if it be a lie, my bonnie boy, You're telling unto me, On the highest tree of Bailsberry, Thereon I'll gar hang thee.’ 15 There was a man in the king's court Had a love to Little Mossgrey; He took a horn out of his pocket, And blew both loud and hie: ‘He that's in bed wi Barnabas' lady, It's time he were away!’ 16 ‘Oh am I not the maddest man Ere lay in a woman's bed! I think I hear his bridle ring, But and his horse feet tread.’ 17 ‘Lye still, lye still, Little Mossgrey, And keep me from the cold; It's but my father's small sheep-herd, Calling his sheep to the fold.’ 18 With wrapped arms in bed they lay Till they fell both asleep, Till up and darts Barnabas himsell, And stood at their bed-fit. 19 ‘How likest thou the bed, Mossgrey? And how loves thou the sheets? And how loves thou my lady fair, Lyes in your arms and sleeps?’ 20 ‘Well I love your bed,’ he says, ‘And far better your sheets; But foul may fa your lady fair, Lyes in my arms and sleeps!’ 21 ‘Rise, O rise, Little Mossgrey, Put on your hose and shoon; I'll neer hae't said in a far countrie I killed a naked man.’ 22 Slowly, slowly rose he up, And slowly put he on, And slowly down the stairs he goes, And thinking to be slain. 23 ‘Here's two swords,’ Barnabas said, ‘I wad they cost me dear; Tak thou the best, I'll tak the warst, We'll try the battle here.’ 24 The first stroke that Mossgrey got, It was baith sharp and sore; And the next stroke his lady got, One word she neer spak more. 25 ‘Ye'll mak a coffin large and wide, And lay this couple in; And lay her head on his right hand, She's come o the highest kin.’ LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—K Dr Joseph Robertson's Journal of Excursions, No 5, taken down from a man in the parish of Leochel, Aberdeenshire, February 12, 1829. 1 It's four and twenty bonny boys Were playin at the ba, And out it cums Lord Barnet's ladie, And playit out ower them a'. 2 And aye she shot it's Little Mousgray, As clear as any sun: ‘O what wad ye gie, it's Little Mousgray, It's in O my arms to won?’ 3 ‘For no, for no, my gay ladie, For no, that maunna be; For well ken I by the rings on your fingers, Lord Barnet's ladie are ye.’ 4 When supper was over, and mass was sung, And a' man boun for bed, It's Little Mousgray and that lady In ae chamber was laid. 5 It's up and starts her little foot-page, Just up at her bed-feet: ‘Hail weel, hail weel, my little foot-page, Hail well this deed on me, An ever I lee my life to brook, I'se pay you well your fee.’ 6 Out it spaks it's Little Mousgray: ‘I think I hear a horn blaw; She blaws baith loud and shill at ilka turning of the tune, Mousgray, gae ye your wa!’ 7 ‘Lie still, lie still, it's Little Mousgray, Had the caul win frae my back; It's bat my father's proud shepherds, The're huntin their hogs to the fauld.’ 8 O up it starts the bold Barnet: 9 ‘Win up, win up, it's Little Mousgray, Draw ti your stockins and sheen; I winna have it for to be said I killed a naked man. 10 ‘There is two swords in my scabbart, They cost me many a pun; Tak ye the best, and I the warst, And we sall to the green.’ 11 The firsten strok Lord Barnet strak, He wound Mousgray very sore; The nexten stroke Lord Barnet strak, Mousgray spak never more. 12 O he's taen out a lang, lang brand, And stripped it athwart the straw, And throch and throu his ain ladie And he's gart it cum and ga. 13 There was nae main made for that ladie, In bower whar she lay dead!

Lord Barnett and Little Munsgrove LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—L Buchan's MSS, I, 27; Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, Percy Society, XVII, 21. 1 Four an twenty handsome youths Were a' playing at the ba, When forth it came him Little Munsgrove, The flower out ower them a'. 2 At times he lost, at times he wan, Till the noon-tide o the day, And four an twenty gay ladies Went out to view the play. 3 Some came down in white velvet, And other some in green; Lord Burnett's lady in red scarlet, And shin'd like ony queen. 4 Some came down in white velvet, And other some in pale; Lord Burnett's lady in red scarlet, Whose beauty did excell. 5 She gae a glance out ower them a', As beams dart frae the sun; She fixed her eyes on Little Munsgrove, For him her love lay on. 6 ‘Gude day, gude day, ye handsome youth, God make ye safe and free; What woud ye gie this day, Munsgrove, For ae night in bower wi me?’ 7 ‘I darena for my lands, lady, I darena for my life; I ken by the rings on your fingers Ye are Lord Burnett's wife.’ 8 ‘It woud na touch my heart, Munsgrove, Nae mair than't woud my tae, To see as much o his heart's blood As twa brands coud let gae. 9 ‘I hae a bower in fair Strathdon, And pictures round it sett, And I hae ordered thee, Munsgrove, In fair Strathdon to sleep.’ 10 Her flattering words and fair speeches, They were for him too strong, And she's prevailed on Little Munsgrove With her to gang along. 11 When mass was sung, and bells were rung, And a' man bound for bed, Little Munsgrove and that lady In ae chamber were laid. 12 ‘O what hire will ye gie your page, If he the watch will keep, In case that your gude lord come hame When we're fair fast asleep?’ 13 ‘Siller, siller's be his wage, And gowd shall be his hire; But if he speak ae word o this, He'll die in a burning fire.’ 14 ‘The promise that I make, Madam, I will stand to the same; I winna heal it an hour langer Than my master comes hame.’ 15 She's taen a sharp brand in her hand, Being in the tidive hour; He ran between her and the door, She never saw him more. 16 Where he found the grass grow green, He slacked his shoes an ran, And where he found the brigs broken, He bent his bow an swam. 17 Lord Burnett ower a window lay, Beheld baith dale and down; And he beheld his ain foot-page Come hastening to the town. 18 ‘What news, what news, my little wee boy, Ye bring sae hastilie?’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my master,’ he says, ‘As ye will plainly see.’ 19 ‘Are any of my biggins brunt, my boy? Or are my woods hewed down? Or is my dear lady lighter yet, O dear daughter or son?’ 20 ‘There are nane o your biggins brunt, master, Nor are your woods hewn down; Nor is your lady lighter yet, O dear daughter nor son. 21 ‘But ye've a bower in fair Strathdon, And pictures round it sett, Where your lady and Little Munsgrove In fair Strathdon do sleep.’ 22 ‘O had your tongue! why talk you so About my gay ladye? She is a gude and chaste woman As in the North Countrie.’ 23 ‘A word I dinna lie, my lord, A word I dinna lie; And if ye winna believe my word, Your ain twa een shall see.’ 24 ‘Gin this be a true tale ye tell, That ye have tauld to me, I'll wed you to my eldest daughter, And married you shall be. 25 ‘But if it be a fause story That ye hae tauld to me, A high gallows I'll gar be built, And hanged shall ye be.’ 26 He's called upon his landlady, The reckoning for to pay, And pulled out twa hands fou o gowd; Says, We'll reckon anither day. 27 He called upon his stable-groom, To saddle for him his steed, And trampled ower yon rocky hills Till his horse hoofs did bleed. 28 There was a man in Lord Burnett's train Was ane o Munsgrove's kin, And aye as fast as the horsemen rade, Sae nimbly's he did rin. 29 He set a horn to his mouth, And he blew loud and sma, And aye at every sounding's end, ‘Awa, Munsgrove, awa!’ 30 Then up it raise him Little Munsgrove, And drew to him his sheen; ‘Lye still, lye still,’ the lady she cried, ‘Why get ye up sae seen?’ 31 ‘I think I hear a horn blaw, And it blaws loud and sma; And aye at every sounding's end, Awa, Munsgrove, awa!’ 32 ‘Lye still, lye still, ye Little Munsgrove, Had my back frae the wind; It's but my father's proud shepherd, Caing his hogs to town.’ 33 ‘I think I hear a horn blaw, And it blaws loud and shrill, And aye at every sounding's end Bids Munsgrove take the hill.’ 34 ‘Lye still, my boy, lye still, my sweet, Had my back frae the cauld; It's but the sugh o the westlin wind, Blawing ower the birks sae bauld.’ 35 He turned him right and round about, And he fell fast asleep; When up it started Lord Burnett, And stood at their bed-feet. 36 ‘Is 'tfor love o my blankets, Munsgrove? Or is't for love o my sheets? Or is't for love o my gay lady? Sae soun in your arms she sleeps!’ 37 ‘It's nae for love o your blankets, my lord, Nor yet for love o your sheets; But wae be to your gay ladye, Sae soun in my arms she sleeps!’ 38 ‘Win up, win up, ye Little Munsgrove, Put all your armour an; It's never be said anither day I killed a naked man. 39 ‘I hae twa brands in ae scabbard, Cost me merks twenty-nine; Take ye the best, gie me the warst, For ye're the weakest man.’ 40 The first an stroke that Munsgrove drew Wounded Lord Burnett sair; The next an stroke Lord Burnett drew, Munsgrove he spake nae mair. 41 He turned him to his ladye then, And thus to her said he: ‘All the time we've led our life I neer thought this o thee. 42 ‘How like ye now this well-faird face, That stands straight by your side? Or will ye hate this ill-faird face, Lyes weltering in his blude?’ 43 ‘O better love I this well-faird face, Lyes weltering in his blude, Then eer I'll do this ill-faird face, That stands straight by my side.’ 44 Then he's taen out a sharp dagger, It was baith keen and smart, And he has wounded that gay ladye A deep wound to the heart. 45 ‘A grave, a grave,’ cried Lord Burnett, ‘To bury these two in, And lay my ladye in the highest flat, She's chiefest o the kin. 46 ‘A grave, a grave,’ said Lord Burnett, ‘To bury these two in; Lay Munsgrove in the lowest flat, He's deepest in the sin. 47 ‘Ye'll darken my windows up secure, Wi staunchions round about, And there is not a living man Shall eer see me walk out. 48 ‘Nae mair fine clothes my body deck, Nor kame gang in my hair, Nor burning coal nor candle light Shine in my bower mair.’ Little Mushiegrove LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD—M Motherwell's Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. xx, XXI It fell upon a Martinmas time, When the nobles were a' drinking wine, That Little Mushiegrove to the kirk he did go, For to see the ladies come in.

There's a man in bed with your wife.’ 7 ‘If it's true you tell unto me, A man I'll make of thee; If it's a lie you tell unto me, It's slain thou shalt be.’ 8 When he came to his hall, The bells begun to ring, And all the birds upon the bush They begun to sing. 9 ‘How do you like my covering-cloths? And how do you like my sheets? How do you like my lady fair, All night in her arms to sleep?’ 10 ‘Your covering-cloths I like right well, Far better than your sheets; Far better than all your lady fair, All night in her arms to sleep.’ 11 ‘Get up, get up now, little Moss Groves, Your clothing do put on; It shall never be said in all England That I drew on a naked man. 12 ‘There is two swords all in the castle That cost me very dear; You take the best, and I the worst, And let's decide it here.’ 13 The very first blow Moss Groves he gave, He wounded the king most sore; The very first blow the king gave him, Moss Groves he struck no more. 14 She lifted up his dying head And kissed his cheek and chin: ‘I'd sooner have you now, little Moss Groves, Than all their castles or kings.’ 82 THE BONNY BIRDY THE BONNY BIRDY Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 42; Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 162. 1 There was a knight, in a summer's night, Was riding oer the lee, diddle An there he saw a bonny birdy, Was singing upon a tree. diddle O wow for day! diddle An dear gin it were day! diddle Gin it were day, an gin I were away!

Ffor thou hast sent her loue-tokens, More now then two or three. 23 ‘Ffor thou hast sent her a mantle of greene, As greene as any grasse, And bade her come to the siluer woode, To hunt with Child Maurice. 24 ‘And thou [hast] sent her a ring of gold, A ring of precyous stone, And bade her come to the siluer wood, Let ffor noe kind of man. 25 ‘And by my ffaith, now, Child Maurice, The tone of vs shall dye!’ ‘Now be my troth,’ sayd Child Maurice, ‘And that shall not be I.’ 26 But hee pulled forth a bright browne sword, And dryed itt on the grasse, And soe ffast he smote att Iohn Steward, I-wisse he neuer [did] rest. 27 Then hee pulled fforth his bright browne sword, And dryed itt on his sleeue, And the ffirst good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke, Child Maurice head he did cleeue. 28 And he pricked itt on his swords poynt, Went singing there beside, And he rode till he came to that ladye ffaire, Wheras this ladye lyed. 29 And sayes, Dost thou know Child Maurice head, If that thou dost itt see? And lapp itt soft, and kisse itt offt, Ffor thou louedst him better than mee.’ 30 But when shee looked on Child Maurice head, Shee neuer spake words but three: ‘I neuer beare no child but one, And you haue slaine him trulye.’ 31 Sayes, Wicked be my merrymen all, I gaue meate, drinke, and clothe! But cold they not haue holden me When I was in all that wrath! 32 ‘Ffor I haue slaine one of the curteousest knights That euer bestrode a steed, Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes That euer ware womans weede!’ Child Noryce CHILD MAURICE—B Motherwell's MS., p. 255; Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 282.

Learned by her of an old woman in Dumbarton: Motherwell's Note Book, fol. 4. 1 Child Noryce is a clever young man, He wavers wi the wind; His horse was silver-shod before, With the beaten gold behind. 2 He called to his little man John, Saying, You don't see what I see; For O yonder I see the very first woman That ever loved me. 3 ‘Here is a glove, a glove,’ he said, ‘Lined with the silver grey; You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood, To speak to Child Nory. 4 ‘Here is a ring, a ring,’ he says, ‘It's all gold but the stane; You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood, And ask the leave o nane.’ 5 ‘So well do I love your errand, my master, But far better do I love my life; O would ye have me go to Lord Barnard's castle, To betray away his wife?’ 6 ‘O don't I give you meat,’ he says, ‘And don't I pay you fee? How dare you stop my errand?’ he says; ‘My orders you must obey.’ 7 O when he came to Lord Bernard's castle, He tinkled at the ring; Who was as ready as Lord Barnard himself To let this little boy in? 8 ‘Here is a glove, a glove,’ he says, ‘Lined with the silver grey; You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood, To speak to Child Nory. 9 ‘Here is a ring, a ring,’ he says, ‘It's all gold but the stane; You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood, And ask the leave o nane.’ 10 Lord Barnard he was standing by, And an angry man was he: ‘O little did I think there was a lord in the world My lady loved but me!’ 11 O he dressed himself in the holland smock, And garments that was gay, And he is away to the merry green-wood, To speak to Child Nory. 12 Child Noryce sits on yonder tree, He whistles and he sings: ‘O wae be to me,’ says Child Noryce, ‘Yonder my mother comes!’ 13 Child Noryce he came off the tree, His mother to take off the horse: ‘Och alace, alace,’ says Child Noryce, ‘My mother was neer so gross!’ 14 Lord Barnard he had a little small sword, That hung low down by his knee; He cut the head off Child Noryce, And put the body on a tree. 15 And when he came home to his castell, And to his ladie's hall, He threw the head into her lap, Saying, Lady, there's a ball! 16 She turned up the bloody head, She kissed it frae cheek to chin: ‘Far better do I love this bloody head Than all my royal kin. 17 ‘When I was in my father's castel, In my virginity, There came a lord into the North, Gat Child Noryce with me.’ 18 ‘O wae be to thee, Lady Margaret,’ he sayd, ‘And an ill death may you die; For if you had told me he was your son, He had neer been slain by me.’ Bob Norice CHILD MAURICE—C Motherwell's MS., p. 510, from the singing of Mrs Storie, wife of William Storie, laborer, Lochwinnoch.

How lang hae ye my lady luved? This day come tell to me.’ 18 ‘First when I your lady loved, In green-wood amang the thyme, I wot she was my first fair love Or ever she was thine. 19 ‘First when I your lady loved, In green-wood amang the flouirs, I wot she was my first fair love Or ever she was yours.’ 20 He's taen out a lang, lang brand That he was used to wear, And he's taen aff Gill Morice head, And put it on a spear: The soberest boy in a' the court Gill Morice head did bear. 21 He's put it in a braid basin, And brocht it in the ha, And laid it in his lady's lap; Said, Lady, tak a ba! 22 ‘Play ye, play ye, my lady,’ he said, ‘Play ye frae ha to bower; Play ye wi Gill Morice head, He was your paramour.’ 23 ‘He was not my paramour, He was my son indeed; I got him in my mother's bower, And in my maiden-weed. 24 ‘I got him in my mother's bower, Wi meikle sin and shame; I brocht him up in good green-wood, Got mony a shower o rain. 25 ‘But I will kiss his bluidy head, And I will clap his chin; I'll make a vow, and keep it true, I'll never kiss man again. 26 ‘Oftimes I by his cradle sat, And fond to see him sleep; But I may walk about his grave, The saut tears for to weep.’ 27 ‘Bring cods, bring cods to my ladye, Her heart is full of wae;’ ‘None of your cods, Burnet,’ she says, ‘But lay me on the strae.’ 28 ‘Pox on you, my lady fair, That wudna telled it me; If I had known he was your son, He had not been slain by me; And for ae penny ye wud hae gien I wud hae gien him three.’ 29 ‘Keep weel your land, Burnet,’ she said, ‘Your land and white monie; There's land eneuch in Norroway Lies heirless I wot the day.’ 30 The one was killed in the mornin air, His mother died at een, And or the mornin bells was rung The threesome were a' gane.

Before it be too late. 11 ‘And here it is a gay manteel, It's a' goud but the hem; Ye must come speak to Child Morice, Bring nae body but your lane. 12 ‘And here it is a holland smock, Your ain hand sewed the sleeve; You must come speak to Chield Morice, Ask not the baron's leave.’ 13 O aye she stamped wi her foot, And winked wi her ee, But a' that she could say or do, Forbidden he wad na be. 14 ‘It's surely to my bouir-woman, It canna be to me:’ ‘I brocht it to Lord Barnard's lady, And I trow that thou art she.’ 15 Out then spak the wylie nurse, Wi the bairn just on her knee: ‘If this be come fra Chield Morice, It's dear welcome to me.’ 16 ‘Thou lies, thou lies, thou wylie nurse, Sae loud's I hear thee lie; I brought it to Lord Barnard's lady, And I trow thou binna she.’ 17 Then up and rose him the bold baron, And an angry man was he; He took the table wi his foot, And keppd it wi his knee, Till silver cup and ezar dish In flinders they did flee. 18 ‘Go bring me one of thy cleeding, That hings upon the pin, And I'll awa to the good green-wood, And crack wi your leman.’ 19 ‘I would have you stay at home, Lord Barnard, I would have you stay at home; Never wyte a man for violence douce That never thought you wrong.’ 20 And when he to the green-wood went, No body saw he there But Chield Morice, on a milk-white steed, Combing down his yellow hair. 21 Chield Morice sat in the gay green-wood, He whistled and he sang: ‘O what means a' thir folks coming? My mother tarries lang.’ 22 ‘No wonder, no wonder, Chield Morice,’ he said, ‘My lady loved thee weel; For the whitest bit of my body Is blacker than thy heel. 23 ‘But nevertheless now, Chield Morice, For a' thy gay beautie, O nevertheless, Chield Morice, Thy head shall go with me.’ 24 He had a rapier by his side, Hung low down by his knee; He struck Chield Morrice on the neck, Till aff his head did flee. 25 Then he's taen up that bloody head, And stuck it on a spear, And the meanest man in a' his train Gat Chield Morice head to bear. 26 The lady looked owre the castle-wa, Wi meikle dool and down, And there she saw Chield Morice head, Coming trailing to the town. 27 But he's taen up this bluidy head, And dashed it gainst the wa: ‘Come down, come down, you ladies fair, And play at this foot-ba.’ 28 Then she's taen up this bluidy head, And she kissed it both cheek and chin: ‘I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head Than a' thy earldom. 29 ‘I got him in my father's bouir, Wi meikle sin and shame, And I brought him up in gay green-wood, Beneath the heavy rain. 30 ‘Many a day have I rockd thy cradle, And fondly seen thee sleep, But now I'll go about thy grave, And sore, sore will I weep.’ 31 ‘O woe be to thee, thou wild woman, And an ill deid may thou die! For if ye had tauld me he was your son, He should hae ridden and gane wi me.’ 32 ‘O hold your tongue, you bold baron, And an ill death may ye die! He had lands and rents enew of his ain, He needed nane fra thee.’ 33 ‘Then I'll curse the hand that did the deed, The heart that thought him ill, The feet that carried me speedilie This comely youth to kill.’ 34 This lady she died gin ten o'clock, Lord Barnard died gin twall, And bonnie boy now, Sweet Willie, What's come o him I canna tell.

I cannot keep you from [your] death; So farewell,’ said Barbara Allen. 9 He turnd his face unto the wall, And death came creeping to him: ‘Then adieu, adieu, and adieu to all, And adieu to Barbara Allen!’ 10 And as she was walking on a day, She heard the bell a ringing, And it did seem to ring to her ‘Unworthy Barbara Allen.’ 11 She turnd herself round about, And she spy'd the corps a coming: ‘Lay down, lay down the corps of clay, That I may look upon him.’ 12 And all the while she looked on, So loudly she lay laughing, While all her friends cry'd [out] amain, ‘Unworthy Barbara Allen!’ 13 When he was dead, and laid in grave, Then death came creeping to she: ‘O mother, mother, make my bed, For his death hath quite undone me. 14 ‘A hard-hearted creature that I was, To slight one that lovd me so dearly; I wish I had been more kinder to him, The time of his life when he was near me.’ 15 So this maid she then did dye, And desired to be buried by him, And repented her self before she dy'd, That ever she did deny him. Barbara Allan BONNY BARBARA ALLAN—C Motherwell's MS., p. 288; from Mrs Duff, Kilbirnie, February 9, 1825. 1 It fell about the Lammas time, When the woods grow green and yellow, There came a wooer out of the West A wooing to Barbara Allan. 2 ‘It is not for your bonny face, Nor for your beauty bonny, But it is all for your tocher good I come so far about ye.’ 3 ‘If it be not for my comely face, Nor for my beauty bonnie, My tocher good ye'll never get paid Down on the board before ye.’ 4 ‘O will ye go to the Highland hills, To see my white corn growing? Or will ye go to the river-side, To see my boats a rowing?’ 5 O he's awa, and awa he's gone, And death's within him dealing, And it is all for the sake of her, His bonnie Barbara Allan. 6 O he sent his man unto the house, Where that she was a dwelling: ‘O you must come my master to see, If you be Barbara Allan.’ 7 So slowly aye as she put on, And so stoutly as she gaed till him, And so slowly as she could say, ‘I think, young man, you're lying.’ 8 ‘O I am lying in my bed, And death within me dwelling; And it is all for the love of thee, My bonny Barbara Allan.’ 9 She was not ae mile frae the town, Till she heard the dead-bell ringing: ‘Och hone, oh hone, he's dead and gone, For the love of Barbara Allan!’ 85 LADY ALICE Lady Alice.

What bear ye on your shoulders?’ ‘We bear the corpse of Giles Collins, An old and true lover of yours.’ 3 ‘O lay him down gently, ye six men tall, All on the grass so green, And tomorrow, when the sun goes down, Lady Alice a corpse shall be seen. 4 ‘And bury me in Saint Mary's church, All for my love so true, And make me a garland of marjoram, And of lemon-thyme, and rue.’ 5 Giles Collins was buried all in the east, Lady Alice all in the west, And the roses that grew on Giles Collins's grave, They reached Lady Alice's breast. 6 The priest of the parish he chanced to pass, And he severed those roses in twain; Sure never were seen such true lovers before, Nor eer will there be again. Giles Collins and Proud Lady Anna LADY ALICE—B Gammer Gurton's Garland, p. 38, ed. 1810. 1 Giles Collins he said to his old mother, Mother, come bind up my head, And send to the parson of our parish, For tomorrow I shall be dead. dead, For tomorrow I shall be dead. 2 His mother she made him some water-gruel, And stirrd it round with a spoon; Giles Collins he ate up his water-gruel, And died before 'twas noon. 3 Lady Anna was sitting at her window, Mending her night-robe and coif; She saw the very prettiest corpse She'd seen in all her life. 4 ‘What bear ye there, ye six strong men, Upon your shoulders so high?’ ‘We bear the body of Giles Collins, Who for love of you did die.’ 5 ‘Set him down, set him down,’ Lady Anna she cry'd, ‘On the grass that grows so green; Tomorrow, before the clock strikes ten, My body shall lye by hisn.’ 6 Lady Anna was buried in the east, Giles Collins was buried in the west; There grew a lilly from Giles Collins That touchd Lady Anna's breast. 7 There blew a cold north-easterly wind, And cut this lilly in twain, Which never there was seen before, And it never will again. Giles Collin LADY ALICE—C Miss M. H. Mason's Nursery Rhymes and Country Songs, p. 46, 1 Giles Collin he said to his mother one day, Oh, mother, come bind up my head! For tomorrow morning before it is day I'm sure I shall be dead. 2 ‘Oh, mother, oh, mother, if I should die, And I am sure I shall, I will not be buried in our churchyard, But under Lady Alice's wall.’ 3 His mother she made him some water-gruel, And stirred it up with a spoon; Giles Collin he ate but one spoonful, And died before it was noon. 4 Lady Alice was sitting in her window, All dressed in her night-coif; She saw as pretty a corpse go by As ever she'd seen in her life. 5 ‘What bear ye there, ye six tall men? What bear ye on your shourn?’ ‘We bear the body of Giles Collin, Who was a true lover of yourn.’ 6 ‘Down with him, down with him, upon the grass, The grass that grows so green; For tomorrow morning before it is day My body shall lie by him.’ 7 Her mother she made her some plum-gruel, With spices all of the best; Lady Alice she ate but one spoonful, And the doctor he ate up the rest. 8 Giles Collin was laid in the lower chancel, Lady Alice all in the higher; There grew up a rose from Lady Alice's breast, And from Giles Collin's a briar. 9 And they grew, and they grew, to the very church-top, Until they could grow no higher, And twisted and twined in a true-lover's knot, Which made all the parish admire. 86 YOUNG BENJIE Young Benjie YOUNG BENJIE—A Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 251, ed. 1803; III, 10, ed. 1833. From tradition. 1 Of a' the maids o fair Scotland The fairest was Marjorie, And Young Benjie was her ae true-love, And a dear true-love was he. 2 And wow! but they were lovers dear, And loved fu constantlie; But ay the mair, when they fell out, The sairer was their plea. 3 And they hae quarrelled on a day, Till Marjorie's heart grew wae, And she said she'd chuse another luve, And let Young Benjie gae. 4 And he was stout, and proud-hearted, And thought o't bitterlie, And he's gaen by the wan moon-light To meet his Marjorie. 5 ‘O open, open, my true-love, O open, and let me in!’ ‘I dare na open, Young Benjie, My three brothers are within.’ 6 ‘Ye lied, ye lied, ye bonny burd, Sae loud's I hear ye lie; As I came by the Lowden banks, They bade gude een to me. 7 ‘But fare ye weel, my ae fause love, That I hae loved sae lang! It sets ye chuse another love, And let Young Benjie gang.’ 8 Then Marjorie turned her round about, The tear blinding her ee: ‘I darena, darena let thee in, But I'll come down to thee.’ 9 Then saft she smiled, and said to him, O what ill hae I done? He took her in his armis twa, And threw her oer the linn. 10 The stream was strang, the maid was stout, And laith, laith to be dang, But ere she wan the Lowden banks Her fair colour was wan. 11 Then up bespak her eldest brother, ‘O see na ye what I see?’ And out then spak her second brother, ‘It's our sister Marjorie!’ 12 Out then spak her eldest brother, ‘O how shall we her ken?’ And out then spak her youngest brother, ‘There's a honey-mark on her chin.’ 13 Then they've taen up the comely corpse, And laid it on the grund: ‘O wha has killed our ae sister, And how can he be found? 14 ‘The night it is her low lykewake, The morn her burial day, And we maun watch at mirk midnight, And hear what she will say.’ 15 Wi doors ajar, and candle-light, And torches burning clear, The streikit corpse, till still midnight, They waked, but naething hear. 16 About the middle o the night The cocks began to craw, And at the dead hour o the night The corpse began to thraw. 17 ‘O wha has done the wrang, sister, Or dared the deadly sin? Wha was sae stout, and feared nae dout, As thraw ye oer the linn?’ 18 ‘Young Benjie was the first ae man I laid my love upon; He was sae stout and proud-hearted, He threw me oer the linn.’ 19 ‘Sall we Young Benjie head, sister? Sall we Young Benjie hang? Or sall we pike out his twa gray een, And punish him ere he gang?’ 20 ‘Ye mauna Benjie head, brothers, Ye mauna Benjie hang, But ye maun pike out his twa gray een, And punish him ere he gang. 21 ‘Tie a green gravat round his neck, And lead him out and in, And the best ae servant about your house To wait Young Benjie on. 22 ‘And ay, at every seven year's end, Ye'll tak him to the linn; For that's the penance he maun drie, To scug his deadly sin.’ Bondsey and Maisry YOUNG BENJIE—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 265. 1 ‘O come along wi me, brother, Now come along wi me; And we'll gae seek our sister Maisry, Into the water o Dee.’ 2 The eldest brother he stepped in, He stepped to the knee; Then out he jumpd upo the bank, Says, This water's nae for me. 3 The second brother he stepped in, He stepped to the quit; Then out he jumpd upo the bank, Says, This water's wondrous deep. 4 When the third brother stepped in, He stepped to the chin; Out he got, and forward wade, For fear o drowning him. 5 The youngest brother he stepped in, Took's sister by the hand; Said, Here she is, my sister Maisry, Wi the hinny-draps on her chin. 6 ‘O if I were in some bonny ship, And in some strange countrie, For to find out some conjurer, To gar Maisry speak to me!’ 7 Then out it speaks an auld woman, As she was passing by: ‘Ask of your sister what you want, And she will speak to thee.’ 8 ‘O sister, tell me who is the man That did your body win? And who is the wretch, tell me, likewise, That threw you in the lin?’ 9 ‘O Bondsey was the only man That did my body win; And likewise Bondsey was the man That threw me in the lin.’ 10 ‘O will we Bondsey head, sister? Or will we Bondsey hang? Or will we set him at our bow-end, Lat arrows at him gang?’ 11 ‘Ye winna Bondsey head, brothers, Nor will ye Bondsey hang; But ye'll take out his twa grey een, Make Bondsey blind to gang. 12 ‘Ye'll put to the gate a chain o gold, A rose garland gar make, And ye'll put that in Bondsey's head, A' for your sister's sake.’ 87 PRINCE ROBERT Prince Robert PRINCE ROBERT—A Scott's Minstrelsy, II, 124, ed. 1802; III, 269, ed. 1833: from the recitation of Miss Christian Rutherford. 1 Prince Robert has wedded a gay ladye, He has wedded her with a ring; Prince Robert has wedded a gay ladye, But he daur na bring her hame. 2 ‘Your blessing, your blessing, my mother dear, Your blessing now grant to me!’ ‘Instead of a blessing ye sall have my curse, And you'll get nae blessing frae me.’ 3 She has called upon her waiting-maid, To fill a glass of wine; She has called upon her fause steward, To put rank poison in. 4 She has put it to her roudes lip, And to her roudes chin; She has put it to her fause, fause mouth, But the never a drop gaed in. 5 He has put it to his bonny mouth, And to his bonny chin, He's put it to his cherry lip, And sae fast the rank poison ran in. 6 ‘O ye hae poisoned your ae son, mother, Your ae son and your heir; O ye hae poisoned your ae son, mother, And sons you'll never hae mair. 7 ‘O where will I get a little boy, That will win hose and shoon, To rin sae fast to Darlinton, And bid Fair Eleanor come? 8 Then up and spake a little boy, That wad win hose and shoon, ‘O I'll away to Darlinton, And bid Fair Eleanor come.’ 9 O he has run to Darlinton, And tirled at the pin; And wha was sae ready as Eleanor's sell To let the bonny boy in? 10 ‘Your gude-mother has made ye a rare dinour, She's made it baith gude and fine; Your gude-mother has made ye a gay dinour, And ye maun cum till her and dine.’ 11 It's twenty lang miles to Sillertoun town, The langest that ever were gane; But the steed it was wight, and the ladye was light, And she cam linkin in. 12 But when she came to Sillertoun town, And into Sillertoun ha, The torches were burning, the ladies were mourning, And they were weeping a'. 13 ‘O where is now my wedded lord, And where now can he be? O where is now my wedded lord? For him I canna see.’ 14 ‘Your wedded lord is dead,’ she says, ‘And just gane to be laid in the clay; Your wedded lord is dead,’ she says, ‘And just gane to be buried the day. 15 ‘Ye'se get nane o his gowd, ye'se get nane o his gear, Ye'se get nae thing frae me; Ye'se na get an inch o his gude broad land, Tho your heart suld burst in three.’ 16 ‘I want nane o his gowd, I want nane o his gear, I want nae land frae thee; But I'll hae the ring that's on his finger, For them he did promise to me.’ 17 ‘Ye'se na get the ring that's on his finger, Ye'se na get them frae me; Ye'se na get the ring that's on his finger, An your heart suld burst in three.’ 18 She's turn'd her back unto the wa, And her face unto a rock, And there, before the mother's face, Her very heart it broke. 19 The tane was buried in Marie's kirk, The tother in Marie's quair, And out o the tane there sprang a birk, And out o the tother a brier. 20 And thae twa met, and thae twa plat, The birk but and the brier, And by that ye may very weel ken They were twa lovers dear.

And Earl Robert has wedded a wife, But he dare na bring her hame. 2 His mother, she called to her waiting-maid, To bring her a pint o wine: ‘For I dinna weel ken what hour of the day That my son Earl Robert shall dine.’ 3 She's put it to her fause, fause cheek, But an her fause, fause chin; She's put it to her fause, fause lips, But never a drap went in. 4 But he's put it to his bonny cheek, Aye and his bonny chin; He's put it to his red rosy lips, And the poison went merrily doun. 5 ‘O where will I get a bonny boy, That will win hose and shoon, That will gang quickly to Sittingen's Rocks, And bid my lady come?’ 6 It's out then speaks a bonny boy, To Earl Robert was something akin: ‘Many a time have I ran thy errand, But this day wi the tears I'll rin.’ 7 Bat when he came to Sittingin's Rocks, To the middle of a' the ha, There were bells a ringing, and music playing, And ladies dancing a'. 8 ‘What news, what news, my bonny boy? What news have ye to me? Is Earl Robert in very good health, And the ladies of your countrie?’ 9 ‘O Earl Robert's in very good health, And as weel as a man can be; But his mother this night has a drink to be druken, And at it you must be.’ 10 She called to her waiting-maid, To bring her a riding-weed, And she called to her stable-groom, To saddle her milk-white steed. 11 But when she came to Earl Robert's bouir, To the middle of a' the ha, There were bells a ringing, and sheets doun hinging, And ladies mourning a'. 12 ‘I've come for none of his gold,’ she said, ‘Nor none of his white monie, Excepting a ring of his smallest finger, If that you will grant me.’ 13 ‘Thou'll not get none of his gold,’ she said, ‘Nor none of his white monie; Thou'll not get a ring of his smallest finger, Tho thy heart should break in three.’ 14 She set her foot unto a stane, Her back unto a tree; She set her foot unto a stane, And her heart did break in three. 15 The one was buried in Mary's kirk, The other in Mary's quire; Out of the one there grew a birk, From the other a bonnie brier. 16 And these twa grew, and these twa threw, Till their twa craps drew near; So all the warld may plainly see That they loved each other dear.

How can I byde with thee? Have I not killd thy ae brother? Thou hadst nae mair but he.’ 3 ‘If you have killd my ae brother, Alas, and woe is me! But if I save your fair body, The better you'll like me.’ 4 She's tane him to her secret bower, Pinnd with a siller pin, And she's up to her highest tower, To watch that none come in. 5 She had na well gane up the stair, And entered in her tower, When four and twenty armed knights Came riding to the door. 6 ‘Now God you save, my fair lady, I pray you tell to me, Saw you not a wounded knight Come riding by this way?’ 7 ‘Yes, bloody, bloody was his sword, And bloody were his hands; But if the steed he rides be good, He's past fair Scotland's strands. 8 ‘Light down, light down then, gentlemen, And take some bread and wine; The better you will him pursue When you shall lightly dine.’ 9 ‘We thank you for your bread, lady, We thank you for your wine; I would gie thrice three thousand pounds Your fair body was mine.’ 10 Then she's gane to her secret bower, Her husband dear to meet; But he drew out his bloody sword, And wounded her sae deep. 11 ‘What aileth thee now, good my lord?

But I care the less for the young Colnel, If thy ain body be free. 13 ‘Come in, come in, my dear Johnstone, Come in and take a sleep; And I will go to my casement, And carefully I will thee keep.’ 14 He had not weel been in her bower-door, No not for half an hour, When four and twenty belted knights Came riding to the bower. 15 ‘Well may you sit and see, lady, Well may you sit and say; Did you not see a bloody squire Come riding by this way?’ 16 ‘What colour were his hawks?’ she says, ‘What colour were his hounds? What colour was the gallant steed, That bore him from the bounds?’ 17 ‘Bloody, bloody were his hawks, And bloody were his hounds; But milk-white was the gallant steed, That bore him from the bounds.’ 18 ‘Yes, bloody, bloody were his hawks, And bloody were his hounds; And milk-white was the gallant steed, That bore him from the bounds. 19 ‘Light down, light down now, gentlemen, And take some bread and wine; And the steed be swift that he rides on, He's past the brig o Lyne.’ 20 ‘We thank you for your bread, fair lady, We thank you for your wine; But I wad gie thrice three thousand pound That bloody knight was taen.’ 21 ‘Lie still, lie still, my dear Johnstone, Lie still and take a sleep; For thy enemies are past and gone, And carefully I will thee keep.’ 22 But Young Johnstone had a little wee sword, Hung low down by his gair, And he stabbed it in fair Annet's breast, A deep wound and a sair. 23 ‘What aileth thee now, dear Johnstone? What aileth thee at me? Hast thou not got my father's gold, Bot and my mither's fee?’ 24 ‘Now live, now live, my dear ladye, Now live but half an hour, And there's no a leech in a' Scotland But shall be in thy bower.’ 25 ‘How can I live? how shall I live?

What colour was the gudely steed The bludie knicht rade on?’ 24 ‘Nut-brown was his hawk,’ they said, ‘And yellow-fit was his hound, And milk-white was the goodly steed The bluidie knicht rade on.’ 25 ‘Gin nut-brown was his hawk,’ she said, ‘And yellow-fit was his hound, And milk-white was the gudely steed, He's up to London gone.’ 26 They spurrd their steeds out ower the lea, They being void o fear; Syne up she gat, and awa she gade, Wi tidings to her dear. 27 ‘Lye still, lye still, Love Willie,’ she said, ‘Lye still and tak your sleep;’ Syne he took up his good braid sword, And wounded her fu deep. 28 ‘O wae be to you, Love Willie,’ she said, ‘And an ill death may ye die!

If ye be well yoursell, my love, The less matter will be. 4 ‘Ye'll do you to yon bigly bower, And take a silent sleep, And I'll watch in my highest tower, Your fair body to keep.’ 5 She has shut her bigly bower, All wi a silver pin, And done her to the highest tower, To watch that nane come in. 6 But as she looked round about, To see what she could see, There she saw nine armed knights Come riding oer the lea. 7 ‘God make you safe and free, lady, God make you safe and free! Did you see a bludy knight Come riding oer the lea?’ 8 ‘O what like was his hawk, his hawk? And what like was his hound? If his steed has ridden well, He's passd fair Scotland's strand. 9 ‘Come in, come in, gude gentlemen, And take white bread and wine; And aye the better ye'll pursue, The lighter that ye dine.’ 10 ‘We thank you for your bread, lady, We thank you for the wine, And I woud gie my lands sae broad Your fair body were mine.’ 11 She has gane to her bigly bower, Her ain gude lord to meet; A trusty brand he quickly drew, Gae her a wound sae deep. 12 ‘What harm, my lord, provokes thine ire To wreak itself on me, When thus I strove to save thy life, Yet served for sic a fee?’ 13 ‘Ohon, alas, my lady gay, To come sae hastilie! I thought it was my deadly foe, Ye had trysted into me. 14 ‘O live, O live, my gay lady, The space o ae half hour, And nae a leech in a' the land But I'se bring to your bower.’ 15 ‘How can I live? how shall I live? How can I live for thee? Ye see my blude rin on the ground, My heart's blude by your knee. 16 ‘O take to flight, and flee, my love, O take to flight, and flee! I woudna wish your fair body For to get harm for me.’ 17 ‘Ae foot I winna flee, lady, Ae foot I winna flee; I've dune the crime worthy o death, It's right that I should die. 18 ‘O deal ye well at my love's lyke The beer but an the wine; For ere the morn, at this same time, Ye'll deal the same at mine.’ Young Johnston YOUNG JOHNSTONE—F Motherwell's Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. xx, XVIII.

And a' man boon to bed, King Honor and his gay ladie In a hie chamer were laid. 6 Then up it raise him Fa'se Footrage, While a' were fast asleep, And slew the porter in his lodge, That watch and ward did keep. 7 O four and twenty silver keys Hang hie upon a pin, And ay as a door he did unlock, He has fastend it him behind. 8 Then up it raise him King Honor, Says, What means a' this din! Now what's the matter, Fa'se Footrage? O wha was't loot you in? 9 ‘O ye my errand well shall learn Before that I depart;’ Then drew a knife baith lang and sharp And pierced him thro the heart. 10 Then up it got the Queen hersell, And fell low down on her knee: ‘O spare my life now, Fa'se Footrage! For I never injured thee. 11 ‘O spare my life now, Fa'se Footrage! Until I lighter be, And see gin it be lad or lass King Honor has left me wi.’ 12 ‘O gin it be a lass,’ he says, ‘Well nursed she shall be; But gin it be a lad-bairn, He shall be hanged hie. 13 ‘I winna spare his tender age, Nor yet his hie, hie kin; But as soon as eer he born is, He shall mount the gallows-pin.’ 14 O four and twenty valiant knights Were set the Queen to guard, And four stood ay at her bower-door, To keep baith watch and ward. 15 But when the time drew till an end That she should lighter be, She cast about to find a wile To set her body free. 16 O she has birled these merry young men Wi strong beer and wi wine, Until she made them a' as drunk As any wallwood swine. 17 ‘O narrow, narrow is this window, And big, big am I grown!’ Yet thro the might of Our Ladie Out at it she has won. 18 She wanderd up, she wanderd down, She wanderd out and in, And at last, into the very swines' stye, The Queen brought forth a son. 19 Then they cast kaivles them amang Wha should gae seek the Queen, And the kaivle fell upon Wise William, And he's sent his wife for him. 20 O when she saw Wise William's wife, The Queen fell on her knee; ‘Win up, win up, madame,’ she says, ‘What means this courtesie?’ 21 ‘O out of this I winna rise Till a boon ye grant to me, To change your lass for this lad-bairn King Honor left me wi. 22 ‘And ye maun learn my gay gose-hawke Well how to breast a steed, And I shall learn your turtle-dow As well to write and read. 23 ‘And ye maun learn my gay gose-hawke To wield baith bow and brand, And I shall learn your turtle-dow To lay gowd wi her hand. 24 ‘At kirk or market where we meet, We dare nae mair avow But, Dame how does my gay gose-hawk?

Gin ilka man had back his ain, Of it you shoud be heir.’ 28 ‘How I should be heir of that castle In sooth I canna see, When it belongs to Fa'se Footrage, And he's nae kin to me.’ 29 ‘O gin ye shoud kill him Fa'se Footrage, You woud do what is right; For I wot he killd your father dear, Ere ever you saw the light. 30 ‘Gin ye should kill him Fa'se Footrage, There is nae man durst you blame; For he keeps your mother a prisoner, And she dares no take you hame.’ 31 The boy stared wild like a gray gose-hawke, Says, What may a' this mean! ‘My boy, you are King Honor's son, And your mother's our lawful queen.’ 32 ‘O gin I be King Honor's son, By Our Ladie I swear, This day I will that traytour slay, And relieve my mother dear.’ 33 He has set his bent bow till his breast, And lap the castle-wa, And soon he's siesed on Fa'se Footrage, Wha loud for help gan ca. 34 ‘O hold your tongue now, Fa'se Footrage, Frae me you shanno flee;’ Syne pierced him through the foul fa'se heart, And set his mother free. 35 And he has rewarded Wise William Wi the best half of his land, And sae has he the turtle-dow Wi the truth of his right hand.

What will they say to me? What will the court and council say But this night I've murderd thee?’ 8 Out and speaks the Eastmure king: ‘Hold your tongue, my pretty may, And come along with me, my dear, And that court ye'll never see.’ 9 He mounted her on a milk-white steed, Himself upon a gray; She turnd her back against the court, And weeping rode away. 10 ‘Now if you be with child,’ he says, ‘As I trew well you be, If it be of a lassie-bairn, I'll give her nurses three. 11 ‘If it be a lassie-bairn, If you please she'll get five; But if it be a bonnie boy, I will not let him live.’ 12 Word is to the city gone, And word is to the town, And word is to the city gone, She's delivered of a son. 13 But a poor woman in the town In the same case does lye, Wha gived to her her woman-child, Took awa her bonnie boy. 14 At kirk or market, whereer they met, They never durst avow, But ‘Thou be kind to my boy,’ she says, ‘I'll be kind to your bonnie dow.’ 15 This boy was sixteen years of age, But he was nae seventeen, When he is to the garden gone, To slay that Eastmure king. 16 ‘Be aware, be aware, thou Eastmure king, Be aware this day of me; For I do swear and do declare Thy botcher I will be.’ 17 ‘What aileth thee, my bonnie boy? What aileth thee at me? I'm sure I never did thee wrang; Thy face I neer did see.’ 18 ‘Thou murdered my father dear, When scarse conceived was I; Thou murdered my father dear, When scarse conceived was me:’ So then he slew that Eastmure king, Beneath that garden tree.

The red run's i the rain:’ ‘I sleep not aft, I wake right aft; Wha's that that kens my name?’ 5 ‘Ye are bidden come to Silver Wood, But I fear you'll never win hame; Ye are bidden come to Silver Wood, And speak wi Jellon Grame.’ 6 ‘O I will gang to Silver Wood, Though I should never win hame; For the thing I most desire on earth Is to speak wi Jellon Grame.’ 7 She had no ridden a mile, a mile, A mile but barely three, Ere she came to a new made grave, Beneath a green oak tree. 8 O then up started Jellon Grame, Out of a bush hard bye: ‘Light down, light down now, Lillie Flower, For it's here that ye maun ly.’ 9 She lighted aff her milk-white steed, And knelt upon her knee: ‘O mercy, mercy, Jellon Grame! For I'm nae prepar'd to die. 10 ‘Your bairn, that stirs between my sides, Maun shortly see the light; But to see it weltring in my blude Would be a piteous sight.’ 11 ‘O shoud I spare your life,’ he says, ‘Until that bairn be born, I ken fu well your stern father Woud hang me on the morn.’ 12 ‘O spare my life now, Jellon Grame! My father ye neer need dread; I'll keep my bairn i the good green wood, Or wi it I'll beg my bread.’ 13 He took nae pity on that ladie, Tho she for life did pray; But pierced her thro the fair body, As at his feet she lay. 14 He felt nae pity for that ladie, Tho she was lying dead; But he felt some for the bonny boy, Lay weltring in her blude. 15 Up has he taen that bonny boy, Gien him to nurices nine, Three to wake, and three to sleep, And three to go between. 16 And he's brought up that bonny boy, Calld him his sister's son; He thought nae man would eer find out The deed that he had done. 17 But it sae fell out upon a time, As a hunting they did gay, That they rested them in Silver Wood, Upon a summer-day. 18 Then out it spake that bonny boy, While the tear stood in his eye, ‘O tell me this now, Jellon Grame, And I pray you dinna lie. 19 ‘The reason that my mother dear Does never take me hame? To keep me still in banishment Is baith a sin and shame.’ 20 ‘You wonder that your mother dear Does never send for thee; Lo, there's the place I slew thy mother, Beneath that green oak tree.’ 21 Wi that the boy has bent his bow, It was baith stout and lang, And through and thro him Jellon Grame He's gard an arrow gang. 22 Says, Lye you thare now, Jellon Grame, My mellison you wi; The place my mother lies buried in Is far too good for thee.

A month or twa is scarcely past Sin I sent my lovie three.’ 4 Then May-a-Roe lap on her steed, And quickly rade away; She hadna ridden but hauf a mile, Till she heard a voice to say: 5 ‘Turn back, turn back, ye ventrous maid, Nae farther must ye go; For the boy that leads your bridle rein Leads you to your overthrow.’ 6 But a' these words she neer did mind, But fast awa did ride; And up it starts him Hynde Henry, Just fair by her right side. 7 ‘Ye'll tarry here, perfidious maid, For by my hand ye'se dee; Ye married my brother, Brown Robin, Whan ye should hae married me.’ 8 ‘O mercy, mercy, Hynde Henry, O mercy have on me! For I am eight months gane wi child, Therefore ye'll lat me be.’ 9 ‘Nae mercy is for thee, fair maid, Nae mercy is for thee; You married my brother, Brown Robin, Whan ye shoud hae married me.’ 10 ‘Ye will bring here the bread, Henry, And I will bring the wine, And ye will drink to your ain love, And I will drink to mine.’ 11 ‘I winna bring here the bread, fair maid, Nor yet shall ye the wine, Nor will I drink to my ain love, Nor yet shall ye to thine.’ 12 ‘O mercy, mercy, Hynde Henry, Until I lighter be! Hae mercy on your brother's bairn, Tho ye hae nane for me.’ 13 ‘Nae mercy is for thee, fair maid, Nae mercy is for thee; Such mercy unto you I'll gie As what ye gae to me.’ 14 Then he's taen out a trusty brand, And stroakd it ower a strae, And thro and thro her fair body He's gart cauld iron gae. 15 Nae meen was made for that lady, For she was lying dead; But a' was for her bonny bairn, Lay spartling by her side. 16 Then he's taen up the bonny bairn, Handled him tenderlie, And said, Ye are o my ain kin, Tho your mother ill used me. 17 He's washen him at the crystal stream, And rowd him in a weed, And namd him after a bold robber Who was calld Robin Hood. 18 Then brought to the next borough's town, And gae him nurses three; He grew as big in ae year auld As some boys woud in three. 19 Then he was sent to guid squeel-house, To learn how to thrive; He learnd as muckle in ae year's time As some boys would in five. 20 ‘But I wonder, I wonder,’ said little Robin, ‘Gin eer a woman bare me; For mony a lady spiers for the rest, But nae ane spiers for me. 21 ‘I wonder, I wonder,’ said little Robin, ‘Were I of woman born; Whan ladies my comrades do caress, They look at me wi scorn.’ 22 It fell upon an evening-tide, Was ae night by it lane, Whan a' the boys frae guid squeel-house Were merrily coming hame, 23 Robin parted frae the rest, He wishd to be alane; And when his comrades he dismist, To guid greenwood he's gane. 24 When he came to guid greenwood, He clamb frae tree to tree, To pou some o the finest leaves, For to divert him wi. 25 He hadna pu'd a leaf, a leaf, Nor brak a branch but ane, Till by it came him Hynde Henry, And bade him lat alane. 26 ‘You are too bauld a boy,’ he said, ‘Sae impudent you be, As pu the leaves that's nae your ain, Or yet to touch the tree.’ 27 ‘O mercy, mercy, gentleman, O mercy hae on me! For if that I offence hae done, It was unknown to me.’ 28 ‘Nae boy comes here to guid greenwood But pays a fine to me; Your velvet coat, or shooting-bow, Which o them will ye gie?’ 29 ‘My shooting-bow arches sae well, Wi it I canno part; Lest wer't to send a sharp arrow To pierce you to the heart.’ 30 He turnd him right and round about, His countenance did change: ‘Ye seem to be a boy right bauld; Why can ye talk sae strange? 31 ‘I'm sure ye are the bauldest boy That ever I talkd wi; As for your mother, May-a-Roe, She was neer sae bauld to me.’ 32 ‘O, if ye knew my mother,’ he said, ‘That's very strange to me; And if that ye my mother knew, It's mair than I coud dee.’ 33 ‘Sae well as I your mother knew, Ance my sweet-heart was she; Because to me she broke her vow, This maid was slain by me.’ 34 ‘O, if ye slew my mother dear, As I trust ye make nae lie, I wyte ye never did the deed That better paid shall be.’ 35 ‘O mercy, mercy, little Robin, O mercy hae on me!’ ‘Sic mercy as ye pae my mother, Sic mercy I'll gie thee. 36 ‘Prepare yourself, perfidious man, For by my hand ye'se dee; Now come's that bluidy butcher's end Took my mother frae me.’ 37 Then he hae chosen a sharp arrow, That was baith keen and smart, And let it fly at Hynde Henry, And piercd him to the heart. 38 These news hae gaen thro Stirling town, Likewise thro Hunting-ha; At last it reachd the king's own court, Amang the nobles a'. 39 When the king got word o that, A light laugh then gae he, And he's sent for him little Robin, To come right speedilie. 40 He's putten on little Robin's head A ribbon and gowden crown, And made him ane o's finest knights, For the valour he had done.

Where is my daughter fair, that used to walk with thee?’ 27 He turnd his head round about, the tears did fill his ee: ‘'Tis a month,’ he said, ‘since she took her chambers from me.’ 28 She went on and there were in the hall Four and twenty ladies, letting the tears down fall. 29 Her daughter had a scope into her cheek and into her chin, All to keep her life till her dear mother came. 30 ‘Come take the rings off my fingers, the skin it is so white, And give them to my mother dear, for she was all the wite. 31 ‘Come take the rings off my fingers, the veins they are so red, Give them to Sir William Fenwick, I'm sure his heart will bleed.’ 32 She took out a razor that was both sharp and fine, And out of her left side has taken the heir of Wallington. 33 There is a race in Wallington, and that I rue full sare; Tho the cradle it be full spread up, the bride-bed is left bare.

Why make ye all this moan? For I'm deep sworn on a book, I must go to Bahome. 7 ‘Traitors false for to subdue Oer seas I'll make me boun, That have trepand our kind Scotchmen, Like dogs to ding them down.’ 8 ‘Weell, take this ring, this royal thing, Whose virtue is unknown; As lang's this ring's your body on, Your blood shall neer be drawn. 9 ‘But if this ring shall fade or stain, Or change to other hue, Come never mair to fair Scotland, If ye're a lover true.’ 10 Then this couple they did part, With a sad heavy moan; The wind was fair, the ship was rare, They landed in Bahome. 11 But in that place they had not been A month but barely one, Till he lookd on his gay gold ring, And riven was the stone. 12 Time after this was not expir'd A month but scarcely three, Till black and ugly was the ring, And the stone was burst in three. 13 ‘Fight on, fight on, you merry men all, With you I'll fight no more; I will gang to some holy place, Pray to the King of Glore.’ 14 Then to the chapel he is gone, And knelt most piteouslie, For seven days and seven nights, Till blood ran frae his knee. 15 ‘Ye'll take my jewels that's in Bahome, And deal them liberallie, To young that cannot, and old that mannot, The blind that does not see. 16 ‘Give maist to women in child-bed laid, Can neither fecht nor flee; I hope she's in the heavens high, That died for love of me.’ 17 The knights they wrang their white fingers, The ladies tore their hair; The women that neer had children born, In swoon they down fell there. 18 But in what way the knight expir'd, No tongue will eer declare; So this doth end my mournful song, From me ye'll get nae mair. 93 LAMKIN Lamkin LAMKIN—A Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 176, communicated by Mrs Brown. 1 It's Lamkin was a mason good as ever built wi stane; He built Lord Wearie's castle, but payment got he nane. 2 ‘O pay me, Lord Wearie, come, pay me my fee:’ ‘I canna pay you, Lamkin, for I maun gang oer the sea.’ 3 ‘O pay me now, Lord Wearie, come, pay me out o hand:’ ‘I canna pay you, Lamkin, unless I sell my land.’ 4 ‘O gin ye winna pay me, I here sall mak a vow, Before that ye come hame again, ye sall hae cause to rue.’ 5 Lord Wearie got a bonny ship, to sail the saut sea faem; Bade his lady weel the castle keep, ay till he should come hame. 6 But the nourice was a fause limmer as eer hung on a tree; She laid a plot wi Lamkin, whan her lord was oer the sea. 7 She laid a plot wi Lamkin, when the servants were awa, Loot him in at a little shot-window, and brought him to the ha. 8 ‘O whare's a' the men o this house, that ca me Lamkin?’ ‘They're at the barn-well thrashing; 'twill be lang ere they come in.’ 9 ‘And whare's the women o this house, that ca me Lamkin?’ ‘They're at the far well washing; 'twill be lang ere they come in.’ 10 ‘And whare's the bairns o this house, that ca me Lamkin?’ ‘They're at the school reading; 'twill be night or they come hame.’ 11 ‘O whare's the lady o this house, that ca's me Lamkin?’ ‘She's up in her bower sewing, but we soon can bring her down.’ 12 Then Lamkin's tane a sharp knife, that hang down by his gaire, And he has gien the bonny babe a deep wound and a sair. 13 Then Lamkin he rocked, and the fause nourice sang, Till frae ilkae bore o the cradle the red blood out sprang. 14 Then out it spak the lady, as she stood on the stair: ‘What ails my bairn, nourice, that he's greeting sae sair? 15 ‘O still my bairn, nourice, O still him wi the pap!’ ‘He winna still, lady, for this nor for that.’ 16 ‘O still my bairn, nourice, O still him wi the wand!’ ‘He winna still, lady, for a' his father's land.’ 17 ‘O still my bairn, nourice, O still him wi the bell!’ ‘He winna still, lady, till ye come down yoursel.’ 18 O the firsten step she steppit, she steppit on a stane; But the neisten step she steppit, she met him Lamkin. 19 ‘O mercy, mercy, Lamkin, hae mercy upon me! Though you've taen my young son's life, ye may let mysel be.’ 20 ‘O sall I kill her, nourice, or sall I lat her be?’ ‘O kill her, kill her, Lamkin, for she neer was good to me.’ 21 ‘O scour the bason, nourice, and mak it fair and clean, For to keep this lady's heart's blood, for she's come o noble kin.’ 22 ‘There need nae bason, Lamkin, lat it run through the floor; What better is the heart's blood o the rich than o the poor?’ 23 But ere three months were at an end, Lord Wearie came again; But dowie, dowie was his heart when first he came hame. 24 ‘O wha's blood is this,’ he says, ‘that lies in the chamer?’ ‘It is your lady's heart's blood; 'tis as clear as the lamer.’ 25 ‘And wha's blood is this,’ he says, ‘that lies in my ha?’ ‘It is your young son's heart's blood; 'tis the clearest ava.’ 26 O sweetly sang the black-bird that sat upon the tree; But sairer grat Lamkin, when he was condemnd to die. 27 And bonny sang the mavis, out o the thorny brake; But sairer grat the nourice, when she was tied to the stake. Lambert Linkin LAMKIN—B Motherwell's MS., p. 15; from the recitation of Mrs Thomson, Kilbarchan, February 25, 1825. 1 Balankin was as gude a mason as eer picked a stane; He built up Prime Castle, but payment gat nane. 2 The lord said to his lady, when he was going abroad, O beware of Balankin, for he lyes in the wood. 3 The gates they were bolted, baith outside and in; At the sma peep of a window Balankin crap in. 4 ‘Good morrow, good morrow,’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘Good morrow to yoursell, sir,’ said the false nurse to him. 5 ‘O where is your good lord?’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘He's awa to New England, to meet with his king.’ 6 ‘O where is his auld son?’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘He's awa to buy pearlings, gin our lady lye in.’ 7 ‘Then she'll never wear them,’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘And that is nae pity,’ said the false nurse to him. 8 ‘O where is your lady?’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘She's in her bower sleeping,’ said the false nurse to him. 9 ‘How can we get at her?’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘Stab the babe to the heart, wi a silver bokin.’ 10 ‘That would be a pity,’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘No pity, no pity,’ said the false nurse to him. 11 Balankin he rocked, and the false nurse she sang, Till all the tores of the cradle wi the red blood down ran. 12 ‘O still my babe, nurice, O still him wi the knife!’ ‘He'll no be still, lady, tho I lay doun my life.’ 13 ‘O still my babe, nurice, O still him wi the kame!’ ‘He'll no be still, lady, till his daddy come hame.’ 14 ‘O still my babe, nurice, O still him wi the bell!’ ‘He'll no be still, lady, till ye come doun yoursell.’ 15 ‘It's how can I come down, this cauld winter nicht, Without eer a coal, or a clear candle-licht?’ 16 ‘There's two smocks in your coffer, as white as a swan; Put one of them about you, it will shew you licht down.’ 17 She took ane o them about her, and came tripping doun; But as soon as she viewed, Balankin was in. 18 ‘Good morrow, good morrow,’ said Lambert Linkin: ‘Good morrow to yoursell, sir,’ said the lady to him. 19 ‘O save my life, Balankin, till my husband come back, And I'll gie you as much red gold as you'll hold in your hat.’ 20 ‘I'll not save your life, lady, till your husband come back, Tho you would give me as much red gold as I could hold in a sack. 21 ‘Will I kill her?’ quo Balankin, ‘will I kill her, or let her be?’ ‘You may kill her,’ said the false nurse, ‘she was neer good to me; And ye'll be laird of the castle, and I'll be ladie.’ 22 Then he cut aff her head fram her lily breast-bane, And he hung't up in the kitchen, it made a' the ha shine. 23 The lord sat in England, a drinking the wine: ‘I wish a' may be weel with my lady at hame; For the rings of my fingers the're now burst in twain!’ 24 He saddled his horse, and he came riding doun, But as soon as he viewed, Balankin was in. 25 He had na weel stepped twa steps up the stair, Till he saw his pretty young son lying dead on the floor. 26 He had not weel stepped other twa up the stair, Till he saw his pretty lady lying dead in despair. 27 He hanged Balankin out over the gate, And he burnt the fause nurice, being under the grate. Lamerlinkin LAMKIN—C Motherwell's MS., p. 9: from Edward King, weaver, Kilbarchan, taken from the recitation of his mother, an old woman. 1 Lamerlinkin, as gude a mason as eer laid a stane, Built a house to Lord Arran, but entrance had nane. 2 Says the lord to his lady, when going abroad, Take care of Lamerlinkin, wha bides in the wood. 3 ‘I care not for Lamkin, nor none of his kin; My house is plastered outside, and bolted within.’ 4 The gates they were locked, baith outside and in, But there was a wee hole that let Lamkin creep in. 5 ‘Good woman, good woman,’ said Lamerlinkin: ‘Good woman, good woman,’ said the fause nurse to him. 6 ‘Where's the lord o this house? is he not within?’ ‘He's up in Old England, he's dining wi the king.’ 7 ‘Where's the lady of this house? or is she not within?’ ‘She's up in her high room, and cannot come down.’ 8 ‘Where is the maids o this house? or are they not within?’ ‘They are at the well washing, and cannot get in.’ 9 ‘Where is the men o this house? or are they not within?’ ‘They are at the barn threshing, and cannot win hame.’ 10 ‘O what will I do, to mak her come doun?’ ‘We'll kill her auld son, to mak her come doun.’ 11 He took out a pen-knife, baith pointed and sharp, And he stabbed the babie three times in the heart. 12 Lamerlinkin did rock, and the fause nurse did sing; Ower the four-cornered cradle the red blood did spring. 13 ‘O please my babie, nurse, O please him wi wands!’ ‘He'll no be pleased, madam, for a' his father's lands.’ 14 ‘O please my babie, nurse, O please him wi keys!’ ‘He'll no be pleased, madam, let me do what I please.’ 15 ‘O please my babie, nurse, O please him with bells!’ ‘He'll no be pleased, madam, till you come down yoursell. 16 ‘How can I come doun this cold frosty night, Without coal or candle for to shew me light?’ 17 ‘The gold rings on your finger are bright as the sun; You may see to cum doun the stair with the light o them.’ 18 O then she came doun the stair, stepping step by step; So ready was Lamkin to grip her in his lap. 19 ‘Save my life, Lamkin, till five minutes break, And I'll give thee gold, the fu o a peck.’ 20 ‘I'll no save your life, till five minutes break, Tho thou should give me gold, the fu of a sack.’ 21 ‘O Jeany, O Jeany, O scour the bason clean, That your lady's noble blood may be kepped clean.’ 22 ‘O no, no, no, Lambkin, my heart will be sare; O take my life, Lambkin, let my lady go.’ 23 He sent for the false nurse, to give her her fee; All the fee that he gave her was to hang her on a tree. 24 He sent for Lamerlinkin, to give him his hire; All the hire that he gave him was to burn him in the fire. Bold Rankin LAMKIN—D Maidment's New Book of Old Ballads, p. 73, No XX; Whitelaw's Book of Scottish Ballads, p. 246, No V: from a manuscript copy, in the possession of W. H. Logan, Edinburgh, derived from oral tradition. 1 Said the lord to his lady, Beware of Rankin; For I am going to England, to wait on the king. 2 ‘No fears, no fears,’ said the lady, said she, ‘For the doors shall be bolted, and the windows pindee. 3 ‘Go bar all the windows, both outside and in; Don't leave a window open, to let Bold Rankin in.’ 4 She has barred all the windows, both outside and in; But she left one of them open, to let Bold Rankin in. 5 ‘O where is the master of this house?’ said Bold Rankin; ‘He's up in Old England,’ said the false nurse to him. 6 ‘O where is the mistress of this house?’ said Bold Rankin; ‘She's up in the chamber sleeping,’ said the false nurse to him. 7 ‘O how shall we get her down?’ said Bold Rankin; ‘By piercing the baby,’ said the false nurse to him. 8 ‘Go please the baby, nursy, go please it with a bell;’ ‘It will not be pleased, madam, till you come down yoursel.’ 9 ‘How can I come down stairs, so late into the night, Without coal or candle, to shew me the light? 10 ‘There is a silver bolt lies on the chest-head; Give it to the baby, give it sweet milk and bread.’ 11 She rammed the silver bolt up the baby's nose, Till the blood it came trinkling down the baby's fine clothes. 12 ‘Go please the baby, nursie, go please it with the bell:’ ‘It will not please, madam, till you come down yoursel. 13 ‘It will neither please with breast-milk, nor yet with pap; But I pray, loving lady, Come and roll it in your lap.’ 14 The first step she stepit, she steppit on a stone; And the next step she stepit, she met Bold Rankin. 15 ‘O Rankin, O Rankin, spare me till twelve o'clock, And I will give you as many guineas as you can carry on your back.’ 16 ‘What care I for as many guineas as seeds into a sack, When I cannot keep my hands off your lily-white neck?’ 17 ‘O will I kill her, nursie, or let her abee?’ ‘O kill her,’ said the false nurse, ‘she was never good to me.’ 18 ‘Go scour the bason, lady, both outside and in, To hold your mother's heart's blood, sprung from a noble kin.’ 19 ‘To hold my mother's heart's blood would make my heart full woe; O rather kill me, Rankin, and let my mother go.’ 20 ‘Go scour the bason, servants, both outside and in, To hold your lady's heart's blood, sprung from a noble kin.’ 21 ‘To hold my lady's heart's blood would make my heart full woe; O rather kill me, Rankin, and let my lady go.’ 22 ‘Go scour the bason, nursy, both outside and in, To hold your lady's heart's blood, sprung from a noble kin.’ 23 ‘To hold my lady's heart's blood would make my heart full glad; Ram in the knife, Bold Rankin, and gar the blood to shed. 24 ‘She's none of my comrades, she's none of my kin; Ram in the knife, Bold Rankin, and gar the blood rin.’ 25 ‘O will I kill her, nursy, or let her abee?’ ‘O kill her,’ said the false nurse, ‘she was never good to me.’ 26 ‘I wish my wife and family may be all well at home; For the silver buttons of my coat they will not stay on.’ 27 As Betsy was looking oer her window so high, She saw her dear father come riding by. 28 ‘O father, dear father, don't put the blame on me It was false nurse and Rankin that killed your lady.’ 29 O was n't that an awful sight, when he came to the stair, To see his fairest lady lie bleeding there! 30 The false nurse was burnt on the mountain hill-head, And Rankin was boiled in a pot full of lead. Lambkin LAMKIN—E Kinloch MSS, V, 246, from Mary Barr. 1 Lambkin was as good a mason as ever laid stone; He builded Lord Montgomery's castle, but payment got none. 2 He builded the castle without and within; But he left an open wake for himself to get in. 3 Lord Montgomery said to his lady, when he went abroad, Take care of Bold Lambkin, for he is in the wood. 4 ‘Gar bolt the gate, nourice, without and within, Leave not the wake open, to let Bold Lambkin in.’ 5 She bolted the gates, without and within, But she left the wake open, to let Bold Lambkin in. 6 ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow,’ says Bold Lambkin then; ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow,’ says the false nurse to him. 7 ‘Where is Lord Montgomery? or where is he gone?’ ‘He is gone up to England, to wait on the king.’ 8 ‘Where are the servants? and where are they gone?’ ‘They are all up to England, to wait upon him.’ 9 ‘Where is your lady? or where is she gone?’ ‘She is in her bower sitting, and sewing her seam.’ 10 ‘O what shall we do for to make her come down?’ ‘We'll kill the pretty baby, that's sleeping so sound.’ 11 Lambkin he rocked, and the false nurse she sung, And she stabbed the babe to the heart with a silver bodkin. 12 ‘O still my babe, nourice, O still him with the pap:’ ‘He'll no be stilled, madam, for this nor for that.’ 13 ‘O still my babe, nourice, go still him with the keys:’ ‘He'll no be stilled, madam, let me do what I please.’ 14 ‘O still my babe, nourice, go still him with the bell:’ ‘He'll no be stilled, madam, till you come down yoursel.’ 15 ‘How can I come down, this cold winter night, When there's neither coal burning, nor yet candle-light?’ 16 ‘The sark on your back is whiter than the swan; Come down the stair, lady, by the light of your hand.’ 17 The lady she cam down the stair trip for trap; Who so ready as Bold Lambkin to meet her in the dark? 18 ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow,’ said Bold Lambkin then; ‘Gude morrow, gude morrow,’ said the lady to him. 19 ‘O where is Lord Montgomery? or where is he gone?’ ‘O he is up to England, to wait on the king.’ 20 ‘O where are your servants? or where are they gone?’ ‘They are all up to England, to wait upon him. 21 ‘I'll give you as much gold, Lambkin, as you'll put in a peck, If you'll spare my life till my lord comes back.’ 22 ‘Tho you would [give] me as much as I could put in a sack, I would not spare thy life till thy lord comes back.’ 23 Lord Montgomery sate in England, drinking with the king; The buttons flew off his coat, all in a ring. 24 ‘God prosper, God prosper my lady and son! For before I get home they will all be undone.’ Long Lankyn LAMKIN—F a. Notes and Queries, Second Series, II, 324, as sung by a nurse nearly a century ago [1856] in Northumberland. b. Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, II, p. 281, from Northamptonshire, communicated by Mr B. H. Cowper. 1 Said my lord to his ladye, as he mounted his horse, (bis) Take care of Long Lankyn, who lies in the moss. (bis) 2 Said my lord to his ladye, as he rode away, Take care of Long Lankyn, who lies in the clay. 3 Let the doors be all bolted, and the windows all pinned, And leave not a hole for a mouse to creep in. 4 Then he kissed his fair ladye, and he rode away; He must be in London before break of day. 5 The doors were all bolted, and the windows were pinned, All but one little window, where Long Lankyn crept in. 6 ‘Where is the lord of this house?’ said Long Lankyn: ‘He is gone to fair London,’ said the false nurse to him. 7 ‘Where is the ladye of this house?’ said Long Lankyn: ‘She's asleep in her chamber,’ said the false nurse to him. 8 ‘Where is the heir of this house?’ said Long Lankyn: ‘He's asleep in his cradle,’ said the false nurse to him. 9 ‘We'll prick him, and prick him, all over with a pin, And that will make your ladye to come down to him.’ 10 So he pricked him and pricked, all over with a pin, And the nurse held a basin for the blood to run in. 11 ‘Oh nurse, how you sleep! Oh nurse, how you snore! And you leave my little son Johnstone to cry and to roar.’ 12 ‘I've tried him with suck, and I've tried him with pap; So come down, my fair ladye, and nurse him in your lap.’ 13 ‘Oh nurse, how you sleep! Oh nurse, how you snore! And you leave my little son Johnstone to cry and to roar.’ 14 ‘I've tried him with apples, I've tried him with pears; So come down, my fair ladye, and rock him in your chair.’ 15 ‘How can I come down, 'tis so late in the night, When there's no candle burning, nor fire to give light?’ 16 ‘You have three silver mantles as bright as the sun; So come down, my fair ladye, by the light of one.’ 17 ‘Oh spare me, Long Lankyn, oh spare me till twelve o'clock, You shall have as much gold as you can carry on your back.’ 18 ‘If I had as much gold as would build me a tower,’ 19 ‘Oh spare me, Long Lankyn, oh spare me one hour, You shall have my daughter Betsy, she is a sweet flower.’ 20 ‘Where is your daughter Betsy? she may do some good; She can hold the silver basin, to catch your heart's blood.’ 21 Lady Betsy was sitting in her window so high, And she saw her father, as he was riding by. 22 ‘Oh father, oh father, don't lay the blame on me; 'Twas the false nurse and Long Lankyn that killed your ladye.’ 23 Then Long Lankyn was hanged on a gallows so high, And the false nurse was burnt in a fire just by. Long Lonkin LAMKIN—G Richardson's Borderer's Table Book, VIII, 410, 1846, communicated by Mrs Blackett, Newcastle, as taken down from the recitation of an old woman of Ovington, Northumberland, “several years ago;” previously in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835, p. 11. 1 The lord said to his ladie, as he mounted his horse, Beware of Long Lonkin, that lies in the moss. 2 The lord said to his ladie, as he rode away, Beware of Long Lonkin, that lies in the clay. 3 ‘What care I for Lonkin, or any of his gang? My doors are all shut, and my windows penned in.’ 4 There were six little windows, and they were all shut, But one little window, and that was forgot. 5 And at that little window long Lonkin crept in. 6 ‘Where's the lord of the hall?’ says the Lonkin: ‘He's gone up to London,’ says Orange to him. 7 ‘Where's the men of the hall?’ says the Lonkin: ‘They're at the field ploughing,’ says Orange to him. 8 ‘Where's the maids of the hall?’ says the Lonkin: ‘They're at the well washing,’ says Orange to him. 9 ‘Where's the ladies of the hall?’ says the Lonkin: ‘They're up in their chambers,’ says Orange to him. 10 ‘How shall we get them down?’ says the Lonkin: ‘Prick the babe in the cradle,’ says Orange to him. 11 ‘Rock well my cradle, and bee-ba my son; You shall have a new gown when the lord he comes home.’ 12 Still she did prick it, and bee-ba she cried: ‘Come down, dearest mistress, and still your own child.’ 13 ‘Oh still my child, Orange, still him with a bell:’ ‘I can't still him, ladie, till you come down yoursell.’ 14 ‘Hold the gold basin, for your heart's blood to run in,’ 15 ‘To hold the gold basin, it grieves me full sore; Oh kill me, dear Lonkin, and let my mother go.’ Buld Rankin LAMKIN—H Kinloch MSS, I, 306. 1 Bauld Rankin was as gude a mason as eer biggit wi stane; He has biggit a bonny castle, but siller he gat nane. 2 ‘Gae bar the gates,’ the lady said, ‘gae bar them out and in; Leave not a door open, lest Rankin should come in.’ 3 They've bard them on the outer side, sae hae they on the in; But left the cellar-door open, and Bauld Rankin crap in. 4 ‘Where's a' the women o the house?’ says Bauld Rankin: ‘They're at the well washing,’ says the fause nurse to him. 5 ‘Where's a' the men of this house?’ says the Bauld Rankin: ‘They are at the barn thrashing,’ says the fause nurse to him. 6 ‘Where's the lady of this house?’ says the Bauld Rankin: ‘She's in the chamber, sleeping,’ says the fause nurse to him. 7 ‘How will we get her wakent? how will we get her down?’ ‘We'll pierce the baby's heart's blood,’ says the fause nurse to him. 8 ‘Come, please the babe, nurse, come please it wi the keys:’ ‘It'll no be pleased, madam, tho I'll down on my knees.’ 9 ‘Come, please the babe, nurse, come, please it wi the knife:’ ‘It'll no be pleased, madam, should I lay down my life.’ 10 ‘Come, please the babe, nurse, come, please it wi the bell:’ ‘It'll no be pleased, madam, till ye come down yoursel.’ 11 ‘How can I come down, how can I come, sae late in the night, And neither coal nor candle, for to shew me light?’ 12 The first step she steppit, she steppit on a stane; The next step she steppit, she met the Bauld Rankin. 13 ‘O spare my life, Rankin, O spare it most dear! I'll gie you as monie guineas as birds in the air. 14 ‘O spare my life, Rankin, O save it most sweet! I'll gie you as monie guineas as there's stanes in the street.’ 15 ‘I wish my wife and bairns may be all well at hame; For the buttons on my waistcoat they winna bide on. 16 ‘I wish my wife and family may be all well at home; For the rings upon my fingers they winna bide on.’ 17 He has kindled a big bane-fire, in the middle o the closs, And he has burned Bauld Rankin, likewise the fause nurse. LAMKIN—I Skene MSS, p. 75, North of Scotland, 1802-03. 1 Lanckin was as guid a mason as ever did use stane; He biggit Lord Murray's house, an payment neer got nane. 2 It fell ance on a day Lord Murray went frae hame, An Lankin came to the fause nourice, 3 ‘O still my bairn, nourice, still him wi the knife:’ ‘He winna still, lady, Tho I should lay down my life.’ 4 ‘O still my bairn, nurice, still him wi the bell:’ ‘He winna still, lady, till ye come down yersel.’ 5 The first [step she steppit], she came on the marble stane; The next step [she steppit], she met him Lankin. 6 ‘O spare my life, Lankin, an I'll gie ye a peck o goud; An that dinna please ye, I'll heap it wi my hand.’ 7 ‘O will I kill the lady, nurice, or will I lat her be?’ ‘O kill her, Lankin, she was never guid to me.’ 8 ‘O wanted ye yer meat, nurice? or wanted ye yer fee? Or wanted ye the othir bounties ladys are wont to gie?’ 9 ‘O kill her, Lankin, she was never guid to me.’ 10 ‘Gae wash a bason, nurice, an ye wash it clean, To cape this ladie's blood; she is come o high kine.’ 11 ‘I winna wash a bason, nor will I wash it clean, To cape this ladie's blood, tho she's come o high kine.’ 12 Bonny sang yon bird, as he sat upon the tree, But sare grat Lankin, for he was hangit hie. 13 Bonny sang the bird, that sat upon the hill, But sare grat the nurice, whan the caudron gan to boil. 14 Lankin was hangit hie, And the fause nourice burnt in the caudron was she. Lammikin LAMKIN—J Kinloch MSS, V, 371, in the handwriting of Dr John Hill Burton. 1 O Lammikin was as good a mason as ever bigget stane; He's bigget Lord Erley's castle, but money he got nane. 2 It fell out upon a time Lord Earley went from home; He left his lady in his castle, but and his young son. 3 ‘Where is the lord o this house, that calls me Lammikin?’ ‘He's on the sea sailing, he will not come home.’ 4 ‘Where are the men o this house, that call me Lammikin?’ ‘They are at the barn threshing, they will not come in.’ 5 ‘Where are the maids of this house, that call me Lammikin?’ ‘They are at the well washing, they will not come in.’ 6 ‘Where is the lady o this house, that calls me Lammikin?’ ‘She's in her room shewing, she will not come down.’ 7 ‘How shall we contrive for to make her come down?’ ‘We'll stick her dear infant, and make her come down.’ 8 O Lammikin he rocket, and the fause nurice sung, While out o the cradle the infant's blude sprung. 9 ‘O still my bairn, nurice,’ the lady did cry: ‘He will not still, lady, for you nor for I.’ 10 ‘O still my bairn, nurice, still him wi the wan:’ ‘He will not still, lady, for a' his father's lan.’ 11 ‘Oh still my bairn, nurice, still him wi the keys:’ ‘Oh he winna still, lady, for a' his father's leys.’ 12 ‘Oh still my bairn, nurice, still him wi the bell:’ ‘Oh he winna still, lady, till ye come down yersell.’ 13 The firsten step that lady stepped, it was upon a stone; The nexten step that lady stepped, she saw him Lammikin. 14 The nexten step that lady stepped was in her own child's blood, 15 ‘Oh will I kill her, nurice, or will I let her be?’ ‘Kill her, dear Lammikin, she was never gude to me.’ 16 ‘Oh wanted you meat, nurice? or wanted you fee? Or wanted you anything that a lady can gie?’ 17 ‘I wanted no meat, lady, nor wanted I fee, But I wanted mony a thing that a lady could gie.’ Long Longkin LAMKIN—K Communicated to Percy by Rev. P.

Can I get at her, to make her understand?’ 5 ‘You cannot get at her, with thousands of lands; You cannot get at her, to make her understand.’ 6 ‘Lady, come down, and please your child,’ 7 ‘Can't you please my child with white bread and breast-wine?’ ‘O lady, come down, and please him awhile.’ 8 ‘How can I go down, this cold winter's night, Without a fire in the kitchen, or candle to light?’ 9 ‘You've got nine bright lamps, just as bright as the king; Lady, come down, and light one of them.’ 10 False Lantin he took her so brave in his arms. 11 Saying, Where is your friend, or where is your foe, That will hold the gold basin, your heart's blood to flow? 12 ‘My nurse is not my friend, my nurse is my foe; She'll hold the gold basin, my heart's blood to flow. 13 ‘O spare my life for one summer's day, And I'll give you as much money as there's sand in the sea.’ 14 ‘I'll not spare your life for one summer's day, And I wont have as much money as there's sand in the sea.’ 15 ‘O spare me my life until one o'clock, And I'll give you Queen Betsie, the flower of the flock.’ 16 ‘O mama, dear mama, then please him awhile; My dada is coming, he's dressed in great style.’ 17 False Lantin he heard the words from the high, Saying, Your mama is dead, and away I will fly. 18 ‘O dada, dear dada, do not blame me, 'Tis nurse and false Lantin betrayed your ladie.’ 19 ‘I'll bury my mama against the wall, And I'll bury my baba, white all, white all.’ Lamkin LAMKIN—U a.

And at the fourth kirk of fair Scotland, She bids you meet her there.’ 29 ‘Come hither, all my merry young men, And drink the good red wine; For we must on to fair Scotland, To free my love frae pine.’ 30 At the first kirk of fair Scotland, They gart the bells be rung; At the second kirk of fair Scotland, They gart the mass be sung. 31 At the third kirk of fair Scotland, They dealt gold for her sake; And the fourth kirk of fair Scotland Her true-love met them at. 32 ‘Set down, set down the corpse,’ he said, ‘Till I look on the dead; The last time that I saw her face, She ruddy was and red; But now, alas, and woe is me!

When my tongue with her never spake, Nor my eyes her ever saw.’ 5 ‘O what is red of her is red As blude drappd on the snaw; And what is white o her is white As milk, or the sea-maw. 6 ‘Even before that lady's yetts You'll find a bowing birk; And there ye'll sit, and sing thereon, Till she gaes to the kirk. 7 ‘Then even before that lady's yetts You'll find a bowing ash; And ye may sit and sing thereon, Till she comes frae the mass. 8 ‘And even before that lady's window You'll find a bed o tyme; And ye may sit and sing thereon, Till she sits down to dine. 9 ‘Even abeen that lady's window There's fixd a siller pin; And a' these words that I tell you, Ye'll sit and sing therein. 10 ‘Ye'll bid her send her love a letter, For he has sent her five; And he'll never send anither ane, To nae woman alive. 11 ‘Ye'll bid her send her love a letter, For he has sent her seven; And he'll never send anither send, To nae maid under heaven.’ 12 This little bird then took his flight, Beyond the raging sea, And lighted at that lady's yetts, On tower o gowd sae hie. 13 Even before that lady's yetts He found a bowing birk; And there he sat, and sang thereon, Till she went to the kirk. 14 Even before that lady's yetts He found a bowing ash; And then he sat and sang thereon, Till she came frae the mass. 15 Even before that lady's window He found a bed o tyme; And then he sat and sang thereon, Till she sat down to dine. 16 Even abeen that lady's window Was fixd a siller pin; And a' the words that were tauld him, He sat and sang them in. 17 ‘You're bidden send your love a letter, For he has sent you five; Or he'll never send anither send, To nae woman alive. 18 ‘You're bidden send your love a letter, For he has sent you seven; And he'll never send anither send, To nae maid under heaven.’ 19 ‘Sit in the hall, good ladies all, And drink the wine sae red, And I will to yon small window, And hear yon birdie's leed. 20 ‘Sing on, sing on, my bonny bird, The sang ye sung just now;’ ‘I'll sing nae mair, ye lady fair, My errand is to you.’ 21 ‘If ye be my true-lovie's bird, Sae well's I will you ken; You will gae in at my gown-sleeve, Come out at my gown-hem.’ 22 ‘That I am come frae your true-love, You soon shall see right plain; And read these lines below my wing, That I hae brought frae him.’ 23 When she looked these lines upon, She read them, and she leuch: ‘O well fails me, my true-love, now, O this I hae eneuch. 24 ‘Here is the broach on my breast-bane, The garlings frae my hair, Likewise the heart that is within; What woud my love hae mair? 25 ‘The nearest kirk in fair Scotland, Ye'll bid him meet me there:’ She has gane to her dear father, Wi heart perplexd and sair. 26 When she came to her auld father, Fell low down on her knee: ‘An asking, asking, father dear, I pray you grant it me.’ 27 ‘Ask what you will, my dear daughter, And I will grant it thee; Unless to marry yon Scottish squire; That's what shall never be.’ 28 ‘O that's the asking, father,’ she said, ‘That I'll neer ask of thee; But if I die in South England, In Scotland ye'll bury me.’ 29 ‘The asking's nae sae great, daughter, But granted it shall be; And tho ye die in South England, In Scotland we'll bury thee.’ 30 She has gane to her step-mother, Fell low down on her knee: ‘An asking, asking, mother dear, I pray you grant it me.’ 31 ‘Ask what ye please, my lily-white dove, And granted it shall be:’ ‘If I do die in South England, In Scotland bury me.’ 32 ‘Had these words spoke been in again, I woud not granted thee; You hae a love in fair Scotland, Sae fain's you woud be tee.’ 33 She scarce was to her chamber gane Nor yet was well set down, Till on the sofa where she sat Fell in a deadly swoon. 34 Her father and her seven brithers, They made for her a bier; The one half o't was gude red gowd, The other siller clear. 35 Her seven sisters were employed In making her a sark; The one half o't was cambric fine, The other needle-wark. 36 Then out it speaks her auld step-dame, Sat on the sofa's end: Ye'll drap the het lead on her cheek, Sae do you on her chin; For women will use mony a wile Their true-loves for to win. 37 Then up it raise her eldest brither, Into her bower he's gane; Then in it came her youngest brither, The het leed to drap on. 38 He drapt it by her cheek, her cheek, Sae did he by her chin; Sae did he by her comely hause; He knew life was therein. 39 The bier was made wi red gowd laid, Sae curious round about; A private entrance there contriv'd, That her breath might win out. 40 The first an kirk in fair Scotland, They gard the bells be rung; The niest an kirk in fair Scotland, They causd the mass be sung. 41 The third an kirk in fair Scotland, They passd it quietly by; The fourth an kirk in fair Scotland, Clerk Sandy did them spy. 42 ‘O down ye'll set this corpse o clay, Lat me look on the dead; For I may sigh, and say, alas! For death has nae remeid.’ 43 Then he has cut her winding sheet A little below her chin, And wi her sweet and ruby lips She sweetly smil'd on him. 44 ‘Gie me a sheave o your white bread, A bottle o your wine; For I hae fasted for your sake Fully these lang days nine. 45 ‘Gae hame, gae hame, my seven brithers, Gae hame and blaw your trumpet; And ye may tell to your step-dame This day she is affronted. 46 ‘I camna here to fair Scotland To lye amo the dead; But came to be Clerk Sandy's wife, And lay gowd on my head. 47 ‘Gae hame, gae hame, my seven brithers, Gae hame and blaw your horn; And ye may tell in fair England In Scotland ye got the scorn. 48 ‘I came not here to fair Scotland To mix amang the clay; But came to be Clerk Sandy's wife, And wear gowd to my tae.’ 49 ‘Sin ye hae gien us this ae scorn, We shall gie you anither; Ye shall hae naething to live upon But the bier that brought you hither.’ THE GAY GOSHAWK—H “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 28 b, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of William Laidlaw. 1 Lord William was walkin i the garden green, Viewin the roses red, An there he spyed his bonnie spier-hawk, Was fleein aboon his head. 2 ‘O could ye speak, my bonnie spier-hawk, As ye hae wings to flee, Then ye wad carry a luve-letter Atween my love an me.’ 3 ‘But how can I your true-love ken?

I hope to live an see the day Whan wi my love I'll meet.’ 5 ‘O gin that ye like me as well As your tongue tells to me, What hour o the night, my lady bright, At your bowr sal I be?’ 6 ‘Whan my father an gay Gilbert Are baith set at the wine, O ready, ready I will be To lat my true-love in.’ 7 O she has birld her father's porter Wi strong beer an wi wine, Untill he was as beastly drunk As ony wild-wood swine: She's stown the keys o her father's yates An latten her true-love in. 8 Whan night was gane, an day was come, An the sun shone on their feet, Then out it spake him Brown Robin, I'll be discoverd yet. 9 Then out it spake that gay lady: My love, ye need na doubt; For wi ae wile I've got you in, Wi anither I'll bring you out. 10 She's taen her to her father's cellar, As fast as she can fare; She's drawn a cup o the gude red wine, Hung't low down by her gare; An she met wi her father dear Just coming down the stair. 11 ‘I woud na gi that cup, daughter, That ye hold i your han For a' the wines in my cellar, An gantrees whare the stan.’ 12 ‘O wae be to your wine, father, That ever't came oer the sea; 'T'is pitten my head in sick a steer I my bowr I canna be.’ 13 ‘Gang out, gang out, my daughter dear, Gang out an tack the air; Gang out an walk i the good green wood, An a' your marys fair.’ 14 Then out it spake the proud porter — Our lady wishd him shame — ‘We'll send the marys to the wood, But we'll keep our lady at hame.’ 15 ‘There's thirty marys i my bowr, There's thirty o them an three; But there's nae ane amo them a' Kens what flowr gains for me.’ 16 She's doen her to her bigly bowr, As fast as she could gang, An she has dresst him Brown Robin Like ony bowr-woman. 17 The gown she pat upon her love Was o the dainty green, His hose was o the saft, saft silk, His shoon o the cordwain fine. 18 She's pitten his bow in her bosom, His arrow in her sleeve, His sturdy bran her body next, Because he was her love. 19 Then she is unto her bowr-door, As fast as she coud gang; But out it spake the proud porter — Our lady wishd him shame — ‘We'll count our marys to the wood, An we'll count them back again.’ 20 The firsten mary she sent out Was Brown Robin by name; Then out it spake the king himsel, ‘This is a sturdy dame.’ 21 O she went out in a May morning, In a May morning so gay, But she came never back again, Her auld father to see. Love Robbie BROWN ROBIN—B Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 136, from the recitation of an old woman in Buckie, Enzie, Banffshire. 1 ‘A featherd fowl's in your orchard, father, O dear, but it sings sweet! What would I give, my father dear, That bonnie bird to meet!’ What would I give, etc. 2 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter Mary, Let a' your folly be; There's six Scots lords tomorrow, child, That will a' dine wi me, And ye maun serve them a', Mary, As't were for meat and fee.’ 3 She served them up, sae has she down, The footmen a' the same, But her mind was aye on Love Robbie, Stood out below the rain. 4 A hundred pun o pennies roun, Tied in a towel so sma, She has gien to him Love Robbie, Out oer the castle-wa; Says, Tak ye that, my love Robbie. And mysel ye may hae. 5 A hundred pun o pennies roun, Tied in a napkin white, She has gien to him Love Robbie, Out oer the garden-dyke; Says, Tak ye that, my Love Robbie, And mysel gin ye like. 6 ‘If this be true ye tell to me, As your tongue woudna lee, I shall be in your bigly bower Before the clock strike three; I shall be in your bigly bower, Dressd like a gay ladye.’ 7 When bells were rung, and mass was sung, And all men bound for bed, Love Robbie came to Mary's bower, Dressd like a comely maid. 8 They had not kissd nor love clappëd, As lovers when they meet, Till sighing said he Love Robbie, My life, my life I doubt. 9 ‘Your life, your life, you Love Robbie, Your life you needna doubt; For it was wiles brought in Robbie, And wiles will lat him out.’ 10 Then in it came her father dear, And stood upon the floor, And she filld the cup of good red wine, Said, Father, will ye drink more? 11 ‘O better I love the cup, Mary, The cup that's in your hand, Than all my barrels full of wine, On the gantrees where they stand.’ 12 ‘O woe be to your wine, father, It eer came oer the sea! If I getna the air o good greenwood O I will surely dee.’ 13 ‘There's seven maries in your bower, There's seven o them and three, And I'll send them to good greenwood, For flowers to shortsome thee.’ 14 ‘There's seven maries in my bower, There's seven o them and three, But there's nae a mary mang them a' Can pu flowers to shortsome me:’ ‘Then by my sooth,’ said her father dear, ‘Let yoursel gang them wi.’ 15 She dressd hersel in the royal red, Love Robbie was in dainty green; Love Robbie's brand was about his middle, And he shone like ony queen. 16 The firsten ane that took the floor, Love Robbie was that ane: ‘Now by my sooth,’ said the proud porter, ‘She is a sonsie dame; I would not care now very much To turn her in again.’ 17 ‘I'd fain see any woman or man, Of high or low degree, Would turn a mary in again That once came out with me.’ 18 They had not been in good greenwood, Pu'd a flower but only three, Till the porter stood behind a bush, And shot him Love Robbie. 19 Now word has come to her father dear, In the chamber where he lay, Lady Mary's sick in good greenwood, And cannot come away. 20 He's taen his mantle him about, His cane into his han, And he is on to good greenwood, As fast as he could gang. 21 ‘O want you fish out o the fleed, Or whale out o the sea? Or is there any one alive This day has angerd thee?’ 22 ‘I want not fish out o the fleed, Nor whale out o the sea; But woe be to your proud porter, Sae sair's he's angerd me! He's shot the fairest flower this day, That would hae comfort me.’ 23 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter Mary, Let a' your folly be; Tomorrow ere I eat or drink High hangëd shall he be.’ Brown Robyn and Mally BROWN ROBIN—C Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 299. 1 ‘There is a bird in my father's orchard, And dear, but it sings sweet! I hope to live to see the day This bird and I will meet.’ 2 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter Mally, Let a' your folly be; What bird is that in my orchard Sae shortsome is to thee? 3 ‘There are four-an-twenty noble lords The morn shoud dine wi me; And ye maun serve them a', Mally, Like one for meat and fee.’ 4 She servd the nobles all as one, The horsemen much the same; But her mind was aye to Brown Robyn, Beneath the heavy rain. 5 Then she's rowd up a thousand pounds Intil a servit white, And she gae that to Brown Robyn, Out ower the garden-dyke: Says, Take ye that, my love Robyn, And mysell gin ye like. 6 ‘If this be true, my dame,’ he said, ‘That ye hae tauld to me, About the hour o twall at night, At your bower-door I'll be.’ 7 But ere the hour o twall did chap, And lang ere it was ten, She had hersell there right and ready To lat Brown Robyn in. 8 They hadna kissd nor love clapped Till the birds sang on the ha; ‘O,’ sighing says him Brown Robyn, ‘I wish I were awa!’ 9 They hadna sitten muckle langer Till the guards shot ower the way; Then sighing says him Brown Robyn, ‘I fear my life this day.’ 10 ‘O had your tongue, my love Robyn, Of this take ye nae doubt; It was by wiles I brought you in, By wiles I'll bring you out.’ 11 Then she's taen up a cup o wine, To her father went she; ‘O drink the wine, father,’ she said, ‘O drink the wine wi me.’ 12 ‘O well love I the cup, daughter, But better love I the wine; And better love I your fair body Than a' the gowd in Spain.’ 13 ‘Wae be to the wine, father, That last came ower the sea; Without the air o gude greenwood, There's nae remeid for me.’ 14 ‘Ye've thirty maries in your bower, Ye've thirty and hae three; Send ane o them to pu a flower, Stay ye at hame wi me.’ 15 ‘I've thirty maries in my bower, I've thirty o them and nine; But there's nae a marie amo them a' That kens my grief and mind. 16 ‘For they may pu the nut, the nut, And sae may they the slae, But there's nane amo them a' that kens The herb that I woud hae.’ 17 ‘Well, gin ye gang to gude greenwood, Come shortly back again; Ye are sae fair and are sae rare, Your body may get harm.’ 18 She dressd hersell into the red, Brown Robyn all in green, And put his brand across his middle, He was a stately dame. 19 The first ane stepped ower the yett, It was him Brown Robyn; ‘By my sooth,’ said the proud porter, ‘This is a stately dame. 20 ‘O wi your leave, lady,’ he said, ‘And leave o a' your kin, I woudna think it a great sin To turn that marie in.’ 21 ‘O had your tongue, ye proud porter, Let a' your folly be; Ye darena turn a marie in That ance came forth wi me.’ 22 ‘Well shall I call your maries out, And as well shall I in; For I am safe to gie my oath That marie is a man.’ 23 Soon she went to gude greenwood, And soon came back again; ‘Gude sooth,’ replied the proud porter, ‘We've lost our stately dame.’ 24 ‘My maid's faen sick in gude greenwood, And sick and liken to die; The morn before the cocks do craw, That marie I maun see.’ 25 Out it spake her father then, Says, Porter, let me know If I will cause her stay at hame, Or shall I let her go? 26 ‘She says her maid's sick in the wood, And sick and like to die; I really think she is too gude Nor ever woud make a lie.’ 27 Then he whispered in her ear, As she was passing by, ‘What will ye say if I reveal What I saw wi my eye?’ 28 ‘If ought ye ken about the same, O heal that well on me, And if I live or brook my life, Rewarded ye shall be.’ 29 Then she got leave o her father To gude greenwood again, And she is gane wi Brown Robyn, But't was lang ere she came hame. 30 O then her father began to mourn, And thus lamented he: ‘O I woud gie ten thousand pounds ‘My daughter for to see.’ 31 ‘If ye will promise,’ the porter said, ‘To do nae injury, I will find out your daughter dear, And them that's gane her wi.’ 32 Then he did swear a solemn oath, By a' his gowd and land, Nae injury to them's be dune, Whether it be maid or man. 33 The porter then a letter wrote, And seald it wi his hand, And sent it to that lady fair, For to return hame. 34 When she came to her father's ha, He received her joyfullie, And married her to Brown Robyn; Now a happy man was he. 35 She hadna been in her father's ha A day but barely three, Till she settled the porter well for life, Wi gowd and white monie. 98 BROWN ADAM Brown Adam BROWN ADAM—A Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 17. 1 O wha woud wish the win to blaw, Or the green leaves fa therewith? Or wha wad wish a leeler love Than Brown Adam the Smith? 2 His hammer's o the beaten gold, His study's o the steel, His fingers white are my delite, He blows his bellows well. 3 But they ha banishd him Brown Adam Frae father and frae mither, An they ha banishd him Brown Adam Frae sister and frae brither. 4 And they ha banishd Brown Adam Frae the flowr o a' his kin; An he's biggit a bowr i the good green wood Betwen his lady an him. 5 O it fell once upon a day Brown Adam he thought lang, An he woud to the green wood gang, To hunt some venison. 6 He's ta'en his bow his arm oer, His bran intill his han, And he is to the good green wood, As fast as he coud gang. 7 O he's shot up, an he's shot down, The bird upo the briar, An he's sent it hame to his lady, Bade her be of good cheer. 8 O he's shot up, an he's shot down, The bird upo the thorn, And sent it hame to his lady, And hee'd be hame the morn. 9 Whan he came till his lady's bowr-door He stood a little foreby, And there he heard a fu fa'se knight Temptin his gay lady. 10 O he's taen out a gay gold ring, Had cost him mony a poun: ‘O grant me love for love, lady, An this sal be your own.’ 11 ‘I loo Brown Adam well,’ she says, ‘I wot sae does he me; An I woud na gi Brown Adam's love For nae fa'se knight I see.’ 12 Out has he ta'en a purse of gold, Was a' fu to the string: ‘Grant me but love for love, lady, An a' this sal be thine.’ 13 ‘I loo Brown Adam well,’ she says, ‘An I ken sae does he me; An I woudna be your light leman For mair nor ye coud gie.’ 14 Then out has he drawn his lang, lang bran, And he's flashd it in her een: ‘Now grant me love for love, lady, Or thro you this sal gang!’ 15 ‘O,’ sighing said that gay lady, ‘Brown Adam tarrys lang!’ Then up it starts Brown Adam, Says, I'm just at your han. 16 He's gard him leave his bow, his bow, He's gard him leave his bran; He's gard him leave a better pledge, Four fingers o his right han. Broun Edom BROWN ADAM—B Harris MS., fol. 27 b, No 26. 1 For wha ere had a lealer luve Than Broun Edom the smith? 2 His studie was o the beaten gowd, His hammer o the pith; His cords waur o the gude green silk, That blew his bellows with. 3 It fell out ance upon a time Broun Edom he thoucht lang, That he wald gae to see his luve, By the le licht o the mune. Brown Adam the Smith BROWN ADAM—C Buchan MSS, I, 46. 1 O wha woud wish the win to blaw, The green leaves fa therewith? O wha would wish a leeler luve Than Brown Adam the Smith? 2 O he forsook the royal court, And knights and lords sae gude, And he is to the black smithy, To learn to shoe a steed. 3 His hammer-shaft o gude red gowd, His studdy o the steel, His fingers whyte, and maids' delight, And blaws his bellows weel. 4 He being a favourite with the king Caused him get mony a fae, And sae their plots they did contrive To work him grief and wae. 5 Of treason then he was accused By his fause enemie, Which caused the king to make a vow That banishd he shoud be. 6 Then banishd hae they Brown Adam Frae father and frae mither, And banishd hae they him Brown Adam Frae sister and frae brither. 7 And they hae banishd him Brown Adam, The flower o a' his kin; He built a bower in gude green wood, For his true love and him. 8 But it fell ance upon a day The king's young son thought lang, And minded him on Brown Adam, Oft rade on his right han. 9 Then he sent for him Brown Adam, To shoe his milk-white steed, That he might see him ance in court, Mang knights o noble bleed. 10 When Brown Adam he read these lines, A light laugh then gae hee: ‘What's this that's made their hearts to fa, They lang sae sair for mee?’ 11 Then out it speaks his gay ladye: Brown Adam, bide wi mee; For if ye gang to court, I fear Your face I'll never see. 12 ‘Cheer up your heart, my ain true-love, Let naething cause your grief; Though I be absent for some days, Ye seen will get relief.’ 13 Then he has kissd his gay ladye, And rade alang the lay, And hunted a' the wild birds there, As he rade on the way. 14 He shot the bunting o the bush, The linnet o the brier, And sent them on to gude green wood, His ladye's heart to cheer. 15 He shot the bunting o the bush, The linnet o the wand, And sent them on to his ladye, Forbade her to think lang. 16 He shot the bunting o the bush, The linnet o the thorn, And sent them on to his ladye, Said he'd be hame the morn. 17 A thought then came into his mind, As he rade on the way, Some evil in his absence might Befa his ladye gay. 18 Now when he had the prince' steed shod, And bound again to ryde, He turned his horse to Ringlewood; Some days he meant to byde. 19 But when he turned to Ringlewood, Ae foot's horse woudna ryde; Whan he turned to his luver's bower, He flew like ony glyde. 20 When he drew near to his luve's bower, There he alighted down, For the hearing o his great horse tramp Ere he wan to the town. 21 Whan he came to his luver's bower, He heard a dolefu din; He wasna aware o a fu fause knight, His true-love's bower within. 22 He bound his steed to his ain stall, And gae him corn and hay, And listened at a shott-window, To hear what he would say. 23 The first and thing the knight drew out, It was a coffer fine; It was as fu o gude black silk, Make ladyes for to shine. 24 ‘Ye are too lack o luve, ladye, And that's a hatefu thing; Luve me, and lat Brown Adam be, And a' this shall be thine.’ 25 ‘O well I like Brown Adam,’ she said, ‘I wyte hee hates nae mee; I winna forsake him Brown Adam For a' your gifts an thee.’ 26 The next and thing the knight drew out, It was a coffer small; It was as fou o shambo gluves, Woud had her hands frae caul. 27 ‘Ye are too lack o luve, ladye, An that's a hatefu thing; Luve me, an lat Brown Adam be, An a' this shall be thine.’ 28 ‘O well like I Brown Adam,’ she said, ‘I'm sure he hates nae me; I winna forsake him Brown Adam For a' your gifts an thee.’ 29 The next and thing the knight drew out It was a coffer fine; It was as fu of gude red gowd As a guinea coud get in. 30 ‘You are too lack o luve, ladye, And that's a hatefu thing; Luve me, and lat Brown Adam be, And a' this shall be thine.’ 31 ‘O well I like Brown Adam,’ she said, ‘I'm sure hee hates nae mee; I winna forsake him Brown Adam For a' the gowd ye'll gie.’ 32 Then his mild mood did quickly change, And grew mair fierce and cruel, And then drew out a trusty brand, Which made her heart to pruel. 33 ‘Since I by you am slighted sae, Since I frae you maun part, I swear a vow before I gae, That this shall pierce your heart.’ 34 ‘But still I like Brown Adam,’ she said, ‘I wat hee hates nae mee; And if he knew my troubles now At my call woud hee be. 35 ‘Although he were sax miles awa, He'd seen be at my han; But wae is me, sae may I say, Brown Adam tarries lang!’ 36 He hit the door then wi his foot, Made a' the bands to flee: ‘Cheer up your heart, my luve Janet, Your love's nae far frae thee.’ 37 Then he drew out a trusty brand, And chassd him thro the ha; The knight jumpd to a shott-window, And woud hae been awa. 38 ‘Stay still, stay still,’ Brown Adam said, ‘Make nae sic haste frae mee; You or I maun rue the race That I came ower the lee.’ 39 Then frae the knight he's taen a wad, His mantle and his brand; Likewise he's taen anither wad, His sword and his sword-hand. 40 He threw him ower the shott-window, Bade him lie there wi care, And never come back to gude green wood To marr fair ladies mair. 41 ‘O I am brown,’ said Brown Adam, ‘And I was never whyte; But my love has robes o different hues, To wear at her delyght. 42 ‘Her kirchies be o cambricks fine, Wi gowd pinnd to the chin; Her robes shall be o the scarlet hue She shall gang daily in.’ 99 JOHNIE SCOT Jack, the Little Scot JOHNIE SCOT—A Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 5. 1 O Johney was as brave a knight As ever saild the sea, An he's done him to the English court, To serve for meat and fee. 2 He had nae been in fair England But yet a little while, Untill the kingis ae daughter To Johney proves wi chil. 3 O word's come to the king himsel, In his chair where he sat, That his ae daughter was wi bairn To Jack, the Little Scott. 4 ‘Gin this be true that I do hear, As I trust well it be, Ye pit her into prison strong, An starve her till she die.’ 5 O Johney's on to fair Scotland, A wot he went wi speed, An he has left the kingis court, A wot good was his need. 6 O it fell once upon a day That Johney he thought lang, An he's gane to the good green wood, As fast as he coud gang. 7 ‘O whare will I get a bonny boy, To rin my errand soon, That will rin into fair England, An haste him back again?’ 8 O up it starts a bonny boy, Gold yallow was his hair, I wish his mither meickle joy, His bonny love mieckle mair. 9 ‘O here am I, a bonny boy, Will rin your errand soon; I will gang into fair England, An come right soon again.’ 10 O whan he came to broken briggs, He bent his bow and swam; An whan he came to the green grass growan, He slaikid his shoone an ran. 11 Whan he came to yon high castèl, He ran it roun about, An there he saw the king's daughter, At the window looking out. 12 ‘O here's a sark o silk, lady, Your ain han sewd the sleeve; You'r bidden come to fair Scotlan, Speer nane o your parents leave. 13 ‘Ha, take this sark o silk, lady, Your ain han sewd the gare; You're bidden come to good green wood, Love Johney waits you there.’ 14 She's turnd her right and roun about, The tear was in her ee: ‘How can I come to my true-love, Except I had wings to flee? 15 ‘Here am I kept wi bars and bolts, Most grievous to behold; My breast-plate's o the sturdy steel, Instead of the beaten gold. 16 ‘But tak this purse, my bonny boy, Ye well deserve a fee, An bear this letter to my love, An tell him what you see.’ 17 Then quickly ran the bonny boy Again to Scotlan fair, An soon he reachd Pitnachton's towrs, An soon found Johney there. 18 He pat the letter in his han An taul him what he sa, But eer he half the letter read, He loote the tears doun fa. 19 ‘O I will gae back to fair Englan, Tho death shoud me betide, An I will relieve the damesel That lay last by my side.’ 20 Then out it spake his father dear, My son, you are to blame; An gin you'r catchd on English groun, I fear you'll neer win hame. 21 Then out it spake a valiant knight, Johny's best friend was he; I can commaun five hunder men, An I'll his surety be. 22 The firstin town that they came till, They gard the bells be rung; An the nextin town that they came till, They gard the mess be sung. 23 The thirdin town that they came till, They gard the drums beat roun; The king but an his nobles a' Was startld at the soun. 24 Whan they came to the king's palace They rade it roun about, An there they saw the king himsel, At the window looking out. 25 ‘Is this the Duke o Albany, Or James, the Scottish king? Or are ye some great foreign lord, That's come a visiting?’ 26 ‘I'm nae the Duke of Albany, Nor James, the Scottish king; But I'm a valiant Scottish knight, Pitnachton is my name.’ 27 ‘O if Pitnachton be your name, As I trust well it be, The morn, or I tast meat or drink, You shall be hanged hi.’ 28 Then out it spake the valiant knight That came brave Johney wi; Behold five hunder bowmen bold, Will die to set him free. 29 Then out it spake the king again, An a scornfu laugh laugh he; I have an Italian i my house Will fight you three by three. 30 ‘O grant me a boon,’ brave Johney cried; ‘Bring your Italian here; Then if he fall beneath my sword, I've won your daughter dear.’ 31 Then out it came that Italian, An a gurious ghost was he; Upo the point o Johney's sword This Italian did die. 32 Out has he drawn his lang, lang bran, Struck it across the plain: ‘Is there any more o your English dogs That you want to be slain?’ 33 ‘A clark, a clark,’ the king then cried, ‘To write her tocher free;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ says Love Johney, ‘To marry my love and me. 34 ‘I'm seeking nane o your gold,’ he says, ‘Nor of your silver clear; I only seek your daughter fair, Whose love has cost her dear.’ McNaughtan JOHNIE SCOT—B Glenriddell MSS, XI, 78: 1791. 1 Johnny's into England gane, Three quarters of a year; Johnny's into England gane, The king's banner to bear. 2 He had na been in England lang, But and a little while, Untill the king's daughter To Johnny gaes wi child. 3 Word is to the kitchin gane, And word is to the ha, And word is to the king's palace, Amang the nobles a'. 4 Word's gane to the king's palace, The palace where she sat, That his ae daughter gaes wi child To Jock, the Little Scot. 5 ‘If she be wi child,’ he says, ‘As I trow well she be, I'll put her into strang prison, And hang her till she die.’ 6 But up and spak young Johnny, And O he spake in time: Is there never a bony boy here Will rin my errand soon? 7 That will gae to yon castle, And look it round about? And there he'll see a fair lady, The window looking out. 8 Up then spak a bony boy, And a bony boy was he: I'll run thy errand, Johnny, he said, Untill the day I die. 9 ‘Put on your gown o silk, madam, And on your hand a glove, And gang into the good green-wood, To Johnny, your true-love.’ 10 ‘The fetters they are on my feet, And O but they are cauld! My bracelets they are sturdy steel, Instead of beaten gold. 11 ‘But I will write a lang letter, And seal it tenderlie, And I will send to my true-love, Before that I do die.’ 12 The first look that Johnny lookd, A loud laughter gae he; But the next look that Johnny gae, The tear blinded his ee. 13 He says, I'll into England gae, Whatever may betide, And a' to seek a fair woman That sud hae been my bride. 14 But up and speaks his father, And O he spak in time: If that ye into England gae, I'm feerd ye neer come hame. 15 But up then speaks our gude Scotch king, And a brisk young man was he: He's hae five hunder o my life-guard, To bear him companie. 16 When Johnny was on saddle set, And seemly for to see, There was not a married man Into his companie. 17 When Johnny sat on saddle-seat, And seemly to behold, The hair that hang on Johnny's head Was like the threads o gold. 18 When he cam to He gard the bells a' ring, Untill the king and a' his court Did marvel at the thing. 19 ‘Is this the brave Argyle,’ he said, ‘That's landed and come hame? Is this the brave Argyle,’ he said, ‘Or James, our Scottish king?’ 20 ‘It's no the brave Argyle,’ they said, ‘That's landed and come hame; But it is a brave young Scottish knight, M?Naughtan is his name.’ 21 ‘If M?Naughtan be his name,’ he says, ‘As I trow weel it be, The fairest lady in a' my court Gangs wi child to thee.’ 22 ‘If that she be wi child,’ he says, ‘As I wat weel she be, I'll mak it lord o a' my land, And her my gay lady.’ 23 ‘I have a champion in my court Will fight you a' by three;’ But up then speaks a brisk young man, And a brisk young man was he: I will fight to my life's end, Before poor Johnny die. 24 The king but and his nobles a' Went out into the plain, The queen but and her maidens a', To see young Johnny slain. 25 The first wound that Johnny gae the champion Was a deep wound and sair; The next wound that he gae the champion, He never spak mair. 26 ‘A priest, a priest,’ young Johnny cries, ‘To wed me and my love;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ the king he cries, ‘To sign her tocher gude.’ 27 ‘I'll hae nane o your goud,’ he says, ‘I'll hae nane o your gear, But a' I want is my true-love, For I hae bought her dear.’ 28 He took out a little goat-horn, And blew baith loud and shill; The victry's into Scotland gane, Tho sair against their will. Johnie Scot JOHNIE SCOT—C Motherwell's MS., p. 213: from the recitation of Mrs Thomson, Kilbarchan. 1 O Johnie's to the hunting gone, Unto the woods sae wild, And Earl Percy's old daughter To Johnie goes with child. 2 O word is to the kitchen gone, And word is to the ha, And word is to the highest towers, Amang the nobles a'. 3 ‘If she be with child,’ her father said, ‘As woe forbid it be, I'll put her into a prison strong, And try the veritie.’ 4 ‘But if she be with child,’ her mother said, ‘As woe forbid it be, I'll put her intil a dungeon dark, And hunger her till she die.’ 5 Then she has wrote a braid letter, And sealed it wi her hand, And sent it to the merry green wood, Wi her own boy at command. 6 The first line of the letter he read, His heart was full of joy; But he had not read a line past two Till the salt tears blind his eye. 7 ‘O I must up to England go, What ever me betide, For to relieve that fair ladie That lay last by my side.’ 8 Out and spak his father then, And he spak all in time: Johnie, if ye to England go, I fear ye'll neer return. 9 But out and spak his uncle then, And he spak bitterlie: Five hundred of my good life-guards Shall go along with thee. 10 When they were mounted on their steeds, They were comely to behold; The hair that hung owre Johnie's shoulders Was like the yellow gold. 11 The first town that they came to, They made the bells to ring; And when they rode the town all owre, They made the trumpets sound. 12 When they came to Earl Percy's gates, They rode them round about, And who saw he but his own true-love, At a window looking out! 13 ‘The doors they are bolted with iron and steel, The windows round about; My feet they are in fetters strong; And how can I get out? 14 ‘My garters they are of the lead, And oh but they be cold! My breast-plate's of the beaten steel, Instead of beaten gold.’ 15 But when they came to Earl Percy's yett, They tirled at the pin; None was so ready as Earl Percy To open and let them in. 16 ‘Art thou the King of Aulsberry, Or art thou the King of Spain? Or art thou one of our gay Scots lords, M?Nachtan by thy name?’ 17 ‘I'm not the King of Aulsberry, Nor yet the King of Spain; But I am one of our gay Scots lords, Johnie Scot I am called by name.’ 18 ‘If Johnie Scot be thy name,’ he said, ‘As I trow weel it be, The fairest lady in a' our court Gaes big with child to thee.’ 19 ‘If she be with child,’ fair Johnie said, ‘As I trow weel she be, I'll make it heir owre a' my land, And her my gay ladie.’ 20 ‘But if she be with child,’ her father said, ‘As I trow weel she be, Tomorrow morn again eight o clock High hanged thou shalt be.’ 21 But out and spak his uncle then, And he spak bitterlie: Before that we see Johnie Scot slain, We'll a' fight till we die. 22 ‘But is there ever a Tailliant about your court, That will fight duels three? Before that I be hanged or slain, On the Tailliant's sword I'll die.’ 23 But some is to the good green wood, And some is to the plain, Either to see fair Johnie hanged, Or else to see him slain. 24 And they began at eight o clock of the morning, And they fought on till three, Till the Tailliant, like a swallow swift, Owre Johnie's head did flee. 25 But Johnie being a clever young boy, He wheeled him round about, And on the point of Johnie's broad sword The Tailliant he slew out. 26 ‘A priest, a priest,’ fair Johnie cried, ‘To wed my love and me;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ her father cried, ‘To sum the tocher free.’ 27 ‘I'll have none of your gold,’ fair Johnie said, ‘Nor none of your white monie; But I will have my own fair bride, For I vow that I've bought her dear.’ 28 He's taen his true-love by the hand, He led her up the plain: ‘Have you any more of your English dogs You want for to have slain?’ 29 He took a little horn out of his pocket, He blew it baith loud and shill, And honour's into Scotland gone, In spite of England's skill. Johnnie Scot JOHNIE SCOT—D Motherwell MS., p. 205: a, “words and tune from Mrs McNiccol,” of Paisley, native of the parish of Houston; b, variations from “John Lindsay, cowfeeder, Wallace Street, Paisley.” 1 O Johnnie Scot walks up and down Among the woods sae wild; Who but the Earl of Percy's ae daughter To him goes big with child! 2 O word is to the kitchen gone, And word's gone to the hall, And word is to King Henry gane, And amongst his nobles all. 3 O Johnnie's called his waiting-man, His name was Germanie: ‘O thou must to fair England go, Bring me that fair ladie.’ 4 He rode till he came to Earl Percy's gate, He tirled at the pin; ‘O who is there?’ said the proud porter, ‘But I daurna let thee in.’ 5 So he rade up, and he rode down, Till he rode it round about; Then he saw her at a wee window, Where she was looking out. 6 ‘O thou must go to Johnnie Scot, Unto the woods so green, In token of thy silken shirt, Thine own hand sewed the seam.’ 7 ‘How can I go to Johnnie Scot? Or how can I get out? My breast plate's o the hard, hard iron, With fetters round about. 8 ‘But I will write a lang letter, And give it unto thee, And thou must take that to Johnnie Scot, See what answer he sends to me.’ 9 When Johnnie looked the letter upon A sorry man was he; He had not read one line but two Till the saut tear did blind his ee. 10 ‘O I must to fair England go, Whatever me betide, All for to fight for that gay ladie That last lay by my side.’ 11 O out and spoke his father then, And he spoke well in time: O if you to fair England go, I doubt your coming home. 12 ‘O no, O no,’ said good King James, ‘Before such a thing shall be, I'll send five hundred of my life-guards, To bear Johnnie company.’ 13 When they were all on saddle set, Most pleasant to behold, The hair that hung over Johnnie's neck Was like the links of gold. 14 When they were all marching away, Most beautiful to see, There was not so much as a married man In Johnnie's company. 15 O Johnnie was the foremost man In the company that did ride; King James he was the second man, Wi his rapier by his side. 16 They rode till they came to Earl Percy's yate, They tirled at the pin: ‘O who is there?’ said the proud porter; ‘But I daurnot let thee in. 17 ‘Is it the Duke of York,’ he said, ‘Or James, our Scotish king? Or is it one of the Scotish lords, From hunting new come home?’ 18 ‘It's not the Duke of York,’ he said, ‘Nor James, our Scotish king; But it is one of the Scotish lords, Earl Hector is my name.’ 19 When Johnnie came before the king, He fell low down on his knee: ‘O the brawest lady in a' my court With child goes big to thee.’ 20 ‘O if she be with child,’ Johnnie said, ‘As I trew well she be, I will make it heir of all my land, And her my gay ladie.’ 21 ‘But if she be with child,’ said the king, ‘As I trew well she be, Before the morn at ten o clock High hanged thou shalt be.’ 22 ‘O no, O no,’ said good King James, ‘Before such a thing shall be, Before that Johnnie Scot be hanged, We'll a' fight till we die.’ 23 ‘But there is a Talliant in my court, Of men he will fight five; Go bring them out to the green wood, See wha will gain the prize.’ 24 Lords and ladies flocked all, They flocked all amain, They flocked all to the green wood, To see poor Johnnie slain. 25 This Talliant he could find no way To be poor Johnnie's dead, But, like unto a swallow swift, He jumped oer Johnnie's head. 26 But Johnnie was a clever man, Cunning and crafty withal, And up on the top of his braid sword He made this Talliant fall. 27 ‘A priest, a priest,’ then Johnnie cried, ‘To marry my love and me;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ her father cried, ‘To sum the tocher free.’ 28 ‘I'll take none of your gold,’ Johnnie said, ‘Nor none of your other gear, But I'll just have my own true-love, This day I've won her dear.’ McNachton JOHNIE SCOT—E Motherwell's MS., p. 113; from the recitation of T. Risk. 1 M?Naughton's unto England gane, The king's banner to bear: ‘O do you see yon castle, boy? It's walled round about; There you will spy a fair ladye, In the window looking out.’ 2 ‘Here is a silken sark, fair lady, Thine own hand sewed the sleeve, And thou must go to yon green wood, To Johnnie thy true-love.’ 3 ‘The castle it is high, my boy, And walled round about; My feet are in the fetters strong, And how can I get out? 4 ‘My garters o the gude black iron, And they are very cold; My breast plate's of the sturdy steel, Instead of beaten gold. 5 ‘But had I paper, pen and ink, And candle at my command, It's I would write a lang letter To John in fair Scotland.’ 6 The first line that Johnnie looked on, A loud, loud lauch leuch he; The second line that Johnnie looked on, The tear did blind his ee. 7 Says, I must unto England go, Whatever me betide, For to relieve my own fair lady, That lay last by my side. 8 Then up and spoke Johnnie's auld mither, A well spoke woman was she: If you do go to England, Johnnie, I may take farewell o thee. 9 Then up and spoke Johnnie's old father, A well spoke man was he: It's twenty-four of my gay troop Shall go along with thee. 10 When Johnie was on saddle set, Right comely to be seen, There was not so much as a married man In Johnie's companie; There was not so much as a married man, Not a one only but ane. 11 The first gude toun that Johnie came to, He made the bells be rung; The next gude toun that Johnie came to, He made the psalms be sung. 12 The next gude toun that Johnie came to, He made the drums beat round, Till the king and all his merry men A-marvelled at the sound. 13 ‘Are you the Duke of Mulberry, Or James, our Scotish king? Are you the Duke of Mulberry, From Scotland new come home?’ 14 ‘I'm not the Duke of Mulberry, Nor James, our Scotish king; But I am a true Scotishman, M?Naughtoun is my name.’ 15 ‘If M?Naughtoun be your name,’ he said, ‘As I trew well it be, The fairest lady in a' my court She goes with child to thee. 16 ‘If M?Nauchton be your name,’ he said, ‘As I trew well it be, Tomorrow morn by eight o clock O hanged you shall be.’ 17 O Johnie had a bonnie little boy, His name was Germany: ‘Before that we be all hanged, my sovereign, We'll fight you till we die.’ 18 ‘Say on, say on, my bonnie little boy, It is well spoken of thee, For there is a campioun in my court Shall fight you three by three.’ 19 Next morning about eight o'clock The king and his merry men, The queen and all her maidens fair, Came whistling down the green, To see the cruel fight begin, And see poor Johnnie slain. 20 They fought on, and Johnie fought on, Wi swords of tempered steel, Until the drops of red, red blood Ran prinkling down the field. 21 They fought on, and Johnie fought on, They fought so manfullie They left not a man alive in all the king's court, Not a man only but three. 22 ‘A priest, a priest,’ poor Johnie cries, ‘To wed my love and me;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ the king did cry, ‘To write her portion free.’ 23 ‘I'll have none of your gold,’ he says, ‘Nor none of your white money, But I will have mine own fair lady, Who has been dear to me.’ 24 Johnie put a horn unto his mouth, He blew it wondrous schill; The sound is unto Scotland gane, Sair against all their will. 25 He put his horn to his mouth, He blew it ower again, And aye the sound the horn cried, ‘M?Naughtoun's cure to them!’ Bonnie Johnie Scot JOHNIE SCOT—F Motherwell's MS., p. 211; from the recitation of Agnes Laird, Kilbarchan, 21 June, 1825. 1 Word has to the kitchen gane, And word has to the ha, And word has to the king himsell, In the chamber where he sat, That his ae daughter gaes wi bairn To bonnie Johnie Scot. 2 Word has to the kitchen gane, And word has to the ha, And word has to the queen hersell, In the chamber where she sat, That her ae dochter gaes wi bairn To bonnie Johnie Scot. 3 ‘O if she be wi bairn,’ he says, ‘As I trew well she be, We'll put her in a prison strang, And try her verity.’ 4 ‘O if she be wi bairn,’ she says, ‘As I trew weel she be, We'll put her in a dungeon dark, And hunger her till she die.’ 5 Now she has written a letter, And sealed it with her hand, And sent it unto Johnie Scot, To come at her command. 6 The first lang line that he looked to, He laughed at the same; The neist lang line that he did read, The tears did blin his een. 7 ‘Once more to England I must go, May God be my sure guide! And all to see that lady fair That last lay by my side.’ 8 Then out bespoke our Scotish king, And he spoke manfullie: I and three thousand of my guards Will bear you companye. 9 They all were mounted on horseback, So gallantly they rode; The hair that hung owre Johnie's shoulders Was like the links of goud. 10 When they came to the king of England's gate, They knocked at the pin; So ready was the king himsell To open and let them in. 11 ‘Are you the Duke [of York],’ he says, ‘Or are ye the King of Spain? Or are ye some of the gay Scots boys, From hunting now come hame?’ 12 ‘I am not the Duke of York,’ he says, ‘Nor yet the King of Spain; But I am one of the gay Scots boys, From hunting just come hame.’ 13 ‘If you are one of the Scots boys, As I trew weel you be, The fairest lady in my hall Gaes big wi child to thee.’ 14 ‘Then if she be wi bairn,’ he says, ‘As I trew weel she be, I'll make him heir of a' my gear, And her my fair ladye.’ 15 ‘If she be wi bairn,’ her father says, ‘As I trew weel she be, Before the morn at ten o'clock High hanged thou shall be.’ 16 Then out bespake our Scotish king, And he spoke manfullie: Before that Johnie Scott be slain, We'll all fight till we die. 17 ‘I have a Talliant in my house We'll fight your men by three;’ ‘Bring out your trooper,’ Johnie says, ‘For fain I would him see.’ 18 Some gade unto the high mountain, Some gade unto the plain, Some at high windows looked out, To see poor Johnie slain. 19 The Talliant he fought on a while, Thinking Johnie would retire, And then he, like a swallow swifte, Owre Johnie's head did flee. 20 But Johnie was a clever man, And turned about with speed, And on the edge of his broadsword He slew the Talliant dead. 21 Then he has brought the lady out, And sat her on a dapple-gray, And being mounted on before, They briskly rode away. 22 Now the honour unto Scotland came, In spite of England's skill; The honour unto Scotland came In spite of England's will. Johnie Scott JOHNIE SCOT—G Motherwell's Note-Book, p. 35, Motherwell MS., p. 394; from the singing of Agnes Lyle, of Kilbarchan, 24 August, 1825. 1 Johnie Scott's a hunting gone, To England woods so wild, Until the king's old dochter dear She goes to him with child. 2 ‘If she be with bairn,’ her mother says, ‘As I trew weel she be, We'll put her in a dark dungeon, And hunger her till she die.’ 3 ‘If she be with bairn,’ her father says, ‘As oh forbid she be! We'll put her in a prison strong, And try the veritie.’ 4 The king did write a long letter, Sealed it with his own hand, And he sent it to Johnie Scot, To speak at his command. 5 When Johnie read this letter long, The tear blindit his ee: ‘I must away to Old England; King Edward writes for me.’ 6 Out and spak his mother dear, She spoke aye in time: Son, if thou go to Old England, I fear thou'll neer come hame. 7 Out and spoke a Scotish prince, And a weel spoke man was he: Here's four and twenty o my braw troops, To bear thee companie. 8 Away they gade, awa they rade, Away they rade so slie; There was not a maried man that day In Johnie's companie. 9 The first good town that they passed thro, They made their bells to ring; The next good town that they passed thro, They made their music sing. 10 The next gude town that they passed thro, They made their drums beat round, The king and a' his gay armies Admiring at the sound. 11 When they came to the king's court, They travelled round about, And there he spied his own true-love, At a window looking out. 12 ‘O fain wald I come down,’ she says, ‘Of that ye needna dout; But my garters they're of cauld, cauld iron, And I can no win out. 13 ‘My garters they're of cauld, cauld iron, And it is very cold; My breast-plate is of sturdy steel, Instead o beaten gold.’ 14 Out and spoke the king himsell, And an angry man was he: The fairest lady in a' my court, She goes with child to thee. 15 ‘If your old doughter be with child, As I trew weel she be, I'll make it heir of a' my land, And her my gay lady.’ 16 ‘There is a Talliant in my court, This day he's killed three; And gin the morn by ten o'clock He'll kill thy men and thee.’ 17 Johnie took sword into his hand, And walked cross the plain; There was many a weeping lady there, To see young Johnie slain. 18 The Talliant never knowing this, Now he'll be Johnie's dead, But, like unto a swallow swift, He flew out owre his head. 19 Johnie was a valliant man, Weel taught in war was he, And on the point of his broad sword The Talliant stickit he. 20 Johnie took sword into his hand, And walked cross the plain: ‘Are there here any moe of your English dogs That's wanting to be slain? 21 ‘A priest, a priest,’ young Johnie cries, ‘To wed my bride and me;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ her father cries, ‘To tell her tocher wi.’ 22 ‘I'm wanting none of your gold,’ he says, ‘As little of your gear; But give me just mine own true-love, I think I've won her dear.’ 23 Johnie sets horn into his mouth, And he blew loud and schrill; The honour it's to Scotland come, Sore against England's will. Love Johny JOHNIE SCOT—H Kinloch MSS, VI, 53, in an unknown hand. 1 ‘Where will I gett a bony boy, That would fain win hose and shoon, That will go on to yon palace, And haste him back again?’ 2 ‘Here am I, a bony boy, That would fain win hose and shoon, That will go on to yon palace, And haste me back again.’ 3 ‘When you come to yon palace, You'l run it round about; There you'l see a gay lady, At the window looking out. 4 ‘Give hir this shirt of silk, Hir own hand sewed the slive, And bid her come to good green woods, Spear no hir parents' leave. 5 ‘Give hir this shirt of silk, boy, Hir own hand sewed the gare; You'l bid her come to good green woods, Love Johny, I'll meet hir there.’ 6 When he came to yon palace, He ran it round about, And there he saw a gay lady, At the window looking out. 7 ‘Take here this shirt of silk, lady, Your own hand sewed the slive; You're biden come to good green woods, Spire no your parents' leave. 8 ‘Take here this shirt of silk, lady, Your own hand sewed the gare; You're biden come to good green woods, Love Johny'll meet you there.’ 9 ‘The staunchens they are strong, boy, Dear, vow but they are stout! My feet they are in strong fetters, And how shall I win out? 10 ‘My garters is of the cold iron, Dear, vow but they are cold! And three splits of the sturdy steel, Instead of beaten goold. 11 ‘But I will write a braud leter, And sign it with my hand, And I will send it to Love Johny, Weel may he understand.’ 12 And she has wrote [a] braud leter, And signd it with hir hand, And sent it on to Love Jony, Weel did he understand. 13 When he got this letter, A light laugh did he gie; But or he read it half down through, The salt tears blinded's ee. 14 Says, I'll awa to fair England, What ever may betide, And all is for the fair lady That lay close by my side. 15 Out it spoke Jony's mother, And she spoke ay through pride; Says, If ye go to fair England, Sir, better to you bide. 16 When Jony was on his sadle set, And seemly to behold, Every tet o Love Jony's hair Was like the threads of goold. 17 When Jony was on his sadle set, And seemly for to see, There was not a maried man In a' Jony's company. 18 The first town that they came till, They gard the bells be rung; The next town that they came till, They gard the mess bee sung. 19 When they came to the king's palace, The drums they did beat round, And the quien and her marys all Amased at the sound. 20 ‘Is this the Duke of Mulberry, Or James, our Scottish king? Or is it any noble lord That's going a visiting?’ 21 ‘It's not the Duke of Mulberry, Nor James, our Scottish king; But it is Jack, the Little Scot, And Auchney is his name.’ 22 ‘If Auchney bee your name,’ he said, ‘As I trust weel it be, The fairest lady in all my court She goes with bairn to the.’ 23 ‘If she be with bairn,’ he said, ‘As I doubt not nor she be, I will make it heir oer all my land, And hir my gay lady.’ 24 The king he swore a solemn oath, And a solemn oath swore he, ‘The morn, before I eat or drink, High hanged he shall be!’ 25 The king and his nobles all Went out into the plain, And the quen and hir marys all, To see Love Johny slain. 26 They fought up, and they fought down, With swords of temperd steel, But not a drop of Johny's blood In that day he did spill. 27 Out they brought the Itilian, And a greecy ghost was he, But by the edge o Love Johny's sword That Itilian did die. 28 Johny's taen his neat drawn sword, And stript it to the stran: ‘Is there any more of your English dogs That wants for to be slain?’ 29 ‘A clerck, a clerck,’ now says the king, ‘To sign her tocher free;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ said Love Johny, ‘To mary my dear and me. 30 ‘I fought not for your goold, your goold, I fought not for your gear, But I fought for my rose Mary, And vow! I've bought hir dear.’ Johnie Buneftan JOHNIE SCOT—I Kinloch MSS, VII, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. 1 Johnie is up to London gane, Three quarters o the year, And he is up to London gane, The king's banner for to bear. 2 He had na been in fair London A twalmonth and a day, Till the king's ae daughter To Johnie gangs wi child. 3 O word is to the kitchen gane, And word is to the ha, And word is to the king himsel Amang his nobles a'. 4 She has wrote a braid letter, She has wrote it tenderly, And she's wrote a braid letter, To lat her Johnie see 5 That her bower is very high, It's aw weel walled about; Her feet are in the fetters strang, Her body looking out. 6 Her garters are of cauld iron, And they are very cold; Her breist-plate is o the sturdy steel, Instead o the beaten gold. 7 Whan he lookit the letter on, A licht lauch gaed he; But eer he read it til an end, The tear blindit his ee. 8 ‘I maun up to London gang, Whatever me betide, And louse that lady out o prison strang; She lay last by my side.’ 9 Up spak Johnie's ae best man, That stood by Johnie's knie: Ye'll get twenty four o my best men, To bear ye companie. 10 When Johnie was in his saddle set, A pleasant sicht to see, There was na ae married man In Johnie's companie. 11 The first toun that he cam till, He made the mass be sung; The niest toun that he cam till, He made the bells be rung. 12 When he cam to fair London, He made the drums gae round; The king and his nobles aw They marvelld at the sound. 13 ‘Is this the Duke of Winesberry, Or James, the Scotish king? Or is it a young gentleman, That wants for to be in?’ 14 ‘It's na the Duke of Winesberry, Nor James, the Scotish king; But it is a young gentleman, Buneftan is his name.’ 15 Up spak the king himsel, An angry man was he: The morn eer I eat or drink Hie hangit sall he be. 16 Up spak Johnie's ae best man, That stood by Johnie's knie: Afore our master he be slain We'll aw fecht till we die. 17 Up spak the king himsel, And up spak he: I have an Italian in my court That will fecht ye manifullie. 18 ‘If ye hae an Italian in your court, Fu fain wad I him see; If ye hae an Italian in your court, Ye may bring him here to me.’ 19 The king and his nobles aw Went tripping doun the plain, Wi the queen and her maries aw, To see fair Johnie slain. 20 Even anent the prison-door The battle did begin; 21 They foucht up, and they foucht doun, Wi swerds o tempered steel, Til Johnie wi his gude braidswerd Made the Italian for to yield. 22 He has kickd him with his foot, And he has kickd him oure the plain: ‘Onie mair Italians in your court Ye want for to be slain?’ 23 ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ the king cried, ‘To sign her tocher-fee;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ young Johnie said, ‘To marry her and me. 24 ‘For I want nane o your gowd, Nor nane o your weel won fee; I only want your fair dochter, I have won her mannfullie.’ JOHNIE SCOT—J Kinloch MSS, VII, 40, 42, 46, 49. 1 O word is to the queen hersel, In parlour whare she sat, That the king's dochter goes wi child To Jock, that little Scot. 2 O word is to the king himsel, And an angry man was he; Says, I will put her in cold prison, And hunger her till she dee. 3 The ladie was laid in cold prison, By the king, a grievous man; And up and starts a little boy, Upon her window-stane. 4 Says, Here's a silken shift, ladye, Your ane hand sewed the sleeve, And ye maun gang to yon greenwud, And of your freends speir na leave. 5 ‘My bouer is very hie,’ said the lady, ‘And it's wondrous hie round about; My feet are lockit in the iron fetters, And how can I get out? 6 ‘But I will write a braid letter, And seal it tenderlie, And send it to yon greenwud, And let young Johnie see.’ 7 O Johnie's to his father gane, And til him did say, O I maun up to London, father, And fecht for that lady gay. 8 His father spak but ae word, Says, I speak it in time; For an ye gang to London, Johnie, I fear your coming hame. 9 And out and spak anither youth, And a pretty youth was he: Afore I see young Johnie dung I'll fecht for him till I dee. 10 He has wallowd it, he has wallowd it, He's wallowd it again; Cries, Onie mae o your English dogs That wants for to be slain? 11 He set the horn until his mouth, And he has blawn baith loud and shill; The victor's doun to Scotland gane, Richt sair against their will.

Or is it Johnie, the Little Scot, That's wanting to be slain?’ 12 ‘It's neither the King of France,’ he said, ‘Nor is't the King of Spain; But it is Johnie, the Little Scot, That's come to claim his ain.’ 13 They foucht it ance, they foucht it twice, They foucht it oure again, Till draps o blood, like draps o rain, War rinning to the plain. 14 Then Johnie drew a nut-brown brand, And strook it oure the plain, Saying, Are there onie mae o your Englishmen That's wanting to be slain? 15 ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ the king he cried, ‘To sign her tocher-fee;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ then Johnie cried, ‘To marry my love and me. 16 ‘I'll hae nane o your gowd,’ he says, ‘As little o your gear; But I'll hae her, my ain true-love, For I'm sure I've coft her dear.’ Johnnie Scott JOHNIE SCOT—L Campbell MSS, I, 57. 1 Johnnie Scott's a hunting gane, To England's woods sae wild; The fairest flower of all England To Johnnie provd big with child. 2 It's word's going up, and word's going down, Going to the king's bower, That his dear daughter was with child, That was his daily flower. 3 ‘If she be with child, As I suppose she be, I'll put her into prison strong, And hunger her till she die.’ 4 The king he wrote a letter broad, And sealed it with his hands, And sent it down to Johnnie Scott, In Scotland where he stands. 5 The first line that Johnnie lookd on, A merry man was he; The next line that he lookd on, The salt tears blinded his eye. 6 Out then spoke his old father, Who neer spoke out of time: And if you go to England, son, I doubt your coming home. 7 Out then spoke our Scottish James, Sitting low by Johnnie's knee: Fifteen score of my life-guards Shall ride in your company. 8 When Johnnie came to the king's court He rode it round about, And there he spied his own true-love, From the jail-window looking out. 9 ‘Come down, true-love,’ said Johnnie Scott, ‘And now you'll ride behind me; Before I leave fair England Some life shall die for thee.’ 10 ‘My feet are in the fetters strong, I'm belted round about; My breastplate is of the stubborn steel, Instead of beaten gold.’ 11 When Johnnie came to the king's bower He tinkled at the ring; Who was so ready as the king himself To let proud Johnnie in! 12 ‘Are ye the Duke of Marlborough,’ he said, ‘Or James, our Scottish king? Or are you my bastard son, From Scotland new come home?’ 13 ‘I'm not the Duke of Marlborough,’ he said, ‘Nor James, our Scottish king; But I am just a good Scotch lad, And Johnnie Scott's my name.’ 14 ‘If you be Johnnie Scott,’ says he, ‘As I suppose you be, The fairest flower in all England Is big with child by thee.’ 15 ‘If she be big with child,’ said he, ‘As I hope her to be, I'll make it heir of all my lands, And she my gay lady.’ 16 ‘O no,’ then the king he crys, ‘There's no such thing will be; There is an Italian in my court, And by his hands ye'll die.’ 17 ‘I'll stand my ground,’ says Johnnie Scott, ‘I'll stand it till I die; I'll stand my ground,’ says Johnnie Scott, ‘One foot I'd scorn to fly.’ 18 When the Italian was brought out, A fearsome sight was he; Between his brows three women's spang, His shoulders was yards three. 19 As Johnnie, being a crafty lad, Well tried at the sword was he, Upon the point of his broad sword He made the Italian die.

Or is it a young gentleman To England new come home?’ 20 ‘It is not the Duke of Mulberry, Nor James the Scottish [king]; But it is a young gentleman, MacNaughten is his name.’ 21 ‘If MacNaughten be your name,’ says the king, ‘As I true well it be, Before the morn at eight o clock Dead hanged you shall be.’ 22 Up bespoke one of Johnie's little boys, And a well-spoke boy was he; ‘Before we see our master hangd, We'l all fight till we dee.’ 23 ‘Well spoke, well spoke, my little boy, That is well spoke of thee; But I have a champian in my bower That will fight you three by three.’ 24 Up then spoke Johnie himself, And he spoke manfully; ‘If it please your Majesty, May I this champian see?’ 25 The king and all his nobles then Rode down unto the plain, The queen and all [her] gay marries, To see young Johnie slain. 26 When the champian came out of the bower, He looked at Johnie with disdain; But upon the tope of Johnie's brodsword This champian soon was slain. 27 He fought on, and Johnie fought on, With swords of tempered steel, And ay the blood like dropes of rain Came trinkling down thier hiel. 28 The very nixt stroke that Johnie gave, He brought him till his knee; The nixt stroke that Johnie gave, He clove his head in twa. 29 He swapt his sword on every side, And turned him on the plain: ‘Have you any more of your English dogs That wants for to be slain?’ 30 ‘A clerk, a clerk!’ the king he crys, ‘I'll seal her taucher free;’ ‘A priest, a priest!’ the queen she crys, ‘For weded they shall be.’ 31 ‘I'll have none of your [gold],’ say[s] he, ‘Nor any of your white money; But I will have my ain true-love; This day she has cost me dear.’ JOHNIE SCOT—R “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 37, Abbotsford, MS. of Thomas Wilkie, p. 11; from Miss Nancy Brockie, Bemerside.

What news have ye brought to me?’ ‘No news, no news, my master dear, But what I will tell thee. 9 ‘O here is a shirt, madam, Your awn hand sewed the sleeve; You must gang to good greenwood, Not ask your parents' leave.’ 10 ‘My doors they are all shut, little boy, My windows round about; My feet is in the fetters strong, And I cannot get out. 11 ‘My garters are of the black, black iron, And O but they are cold! My breast-plate's o the strong, strong steel, Instead of beaten gold. 12 ‘But tell him for to bide away, And not come near to me, For there's a champion in my father's ha Will fight him till he dee.’ 13 ‘What news, what news, my little boy? What news have ye to me?’ ‘No news, no news, my master dear, But what I will tell thee. 14 ‘Her doors they are all shut, kind sir, Her windows round about; Her feet are in the fetters strong, And she cannot get out. 15 ‘Her garters are of the black, black iron, And O but they are cold! Her breast-plate's of the strong, strong steel, Instead of beaten gold. 16 ‘She bids you for to bide away, And not go near to see, For there's a champion in her father's house Will fight you till you die.’ 17 Then up and spoke Lord Jonnie's mother, But she spoke out of time; ‘O if you go to fair England I fear you will be slain.’ 18 But up and spoke a little boy, Just at Lord Jonnie's knee, ‘Before you lose your ain true-love, We'll a' fight till we die.’ 19 The first church-town that they came to, They made the bells be rung; The next church-town that they came to, The[y] gard the mass be sung. 20 The next church-town that they came to, They made the drums go through; The king and all his nobles stood Amazing for to view. 21 ‘Is this any English gentleman, Or James our Scottish king? Or is it a Scottish gentleman, To England new come in?’ 22 ‘No, 'tis no English gentleman, Nor James the Scottish king; But it is a Scottish gentleman, Lord Jonnie is my name.’ 23 ‘If Lord Jonnie be your name, As I suppose it be, I have a champion in my hall Will fight you till you die.’ 24 ‘O go fetch out that gurrley fellow, Go fetch him out to me; Before I lose my ain true-love, We'll all fight till we die.’ 25 Then out and came that gurrly fellow, A gurrly fellow was he, With twa lang sclasps between his eyes, His shoulders there were three. 26 The king and all his nobles stood To see the battle gained; The queen and all her maries stood To see Lord Jonnie slain. 27 The first stroke that Lord Jonnie gave, He wounded very sore; The next stroke that Lord Jonnie gave, The champion could fight no more. 28 He's taen a whistle out from his side, He's blawn a blast loud and shill: ‘Is there any more of your English dogs To come here and be killed?’ 29 ‘A clerk, a clerk!’ the king did say, ‘To cry her toucher free;’ ‘A priest, a priest!’ Lord Jonnie [did] cry ‘To wed my love and me. 30 ‘'Twas for none of your monnie I fought, Nor for none of your world's gear; But it was for my own true-love; I think I've bought her dear.’ “This song (L.

For a' the hairs o Johny's head Did shine like threads o gold. 20 The first ae town that they gaed through, They gart the bells be rung, But the neist town that they gaed through They gart the mass be sung. 21 But when they gaed to London town The trumpets loud were blown, Which made the king and a' his court To marvel at the sound. 22 ‘Is this the Duke of Morebattle?

The truth's in your right hand; Ye's hae some o my gold, and some o my gear, And the twalt part o my land.’ 14 ‘It's I will marry your daughter Janet; The truth's in my right hand; I'll hae nane o your gold, nor nane o your gear, I've enough in my own land. 15 ‘But I will marry your daughter Janet With thirty ploughs and three, And four and twenty bonny breast-mills, And a' on the water o Dee.’ Lord Thomas of Winesberrie WILLIE O WINSBURY—H Kinloch's Scottish Ballads, p. 92. 1 It fell upon a time, when the proud king of France Went a hunting for five months and more, That his dochter fell in love with Thomas of Winesberrie, From Scotland newly come oer. 2 Whan her father cam hame frae hunting the deer, And his dochter before him cam, Her belly it was big, and her twa sides round, And her fair colour was wan. 3 ‘What ails thee, what ails thee, my dochter Janet? What maks thee to look sae wan? Ye've either been sick, and very, very sick, Or else ye hae lain wi a man.’ 4 ‘Ye're welcome, ye're welcome, dear father,’ she says, ‘Ye're welcome hame to your ain, For I hae been sick, and very, very sick, Thinking lang for your coming hame. 5 ‘O pardon, O pardon, dear father,’ she says, ‘A pardon ye'll grant me:’ ‘Na pardon, na pardon, my dochter,’ he says, ‘Na pardon I'll grant thee. 6 ‘O is it to a man of micht, Or to a man of mean? Or is it to onie of thae rank robbers That I sent hame frae Spain?’ 7 ‘It is not to a man of micht, Nor to a man of mean; But it is to Thomas o Winesberrie, And for him I suffer pain.’ 8 ‘If it be to Thomas o' Winesberrie, As I trust well it be, Before I either eat or drink, Hie hangit sall he be.’ 9 When this bonnie boy was brought afore the king, His claithing was o the silk, His fine yellow hair hang dangling doun, And his skin was like the milk. 10 ‘Na wonder, na wonder, Lord Thomas,’ he says, ‘My dochter fell in love wi thee, For if I war a woman, as I am a man, My bed-fellow ye shoud be. 11 ‘Then will ye marry my dochter Janet, To be heir to a' my land? O will ye marry my dochter Janet, Wi the truth o your richt hand?’ 12 ‘I will marry your dochter Janet, Wi the truth o my richt hand; I'll hae nane o your gowd, nor yet o your gear, I've eneuch in fair Scotland. 13 ‘But I will marry your dochter Janet, I care na for your land, For she's be a queen, and I a king, Whan we come to fair Scotland.’ Lord Thomas of Winsberry WILLIE O WINSBURY—I a.

Or is it to one of those rank rebels, That lately from Scotland came?’ 6 ‘O it is to a man of might,’ she says, ‘It is not to one that is mean; It is to Lord Thomas of Winsberry, And for him I must suffer pain.’ 7 The king called up his merry men all, By one, by two, and by three: ‘Go fetch me Lord Thomas of Winsberry, For tomorrow he shall die.’ 8 They sought him up, they sought him down, As fast as fast could be; There they found Lord Thomas of Winsberry, Sitting under an orange tree. 9 ‘Get up, get up, Lord Thomas,’ they said, ‘Get up, and bound your way; For the king has sworn by his honoured crown That tomorrow is thy dying-day.’ 10 ‘O what have I robbd, or what have I stolen, Or what have I killed or slain, That I should be afraid to speak to your king? For I have done him no wrong.’ 11 Lord Thomas came tripping up the stair, His cloathing was of the silk; His fine yellow hair hung dangling down, His skin was white as the milk. 12 And when he came before the king He kneeled down on his knee; Says, What is your will with me, my liege, What is your will with me? 13 ‘I think no wonder, Lord Thomas,’ he says, ‘That my daughter fell in love with thee; If thou wert a woman, as thou art a man, My bed-fellow thou wouldst be. 14 ‘Will ye marry my daughter Jean, By the faith of thy right hand? Thou'se have part of my gold, part of my gear, And a third part of my land.’ 15 ‘Yes, I will marry thy daughter Jean, By the faith of my right hand; I'll have none of your gold, none of your gear; I have enough in fair Scotland.’ 16 He has mounted her on a milk-white steed, Himself on a dapple-grey; He's got as much land in fair Scotland As they can ride in a summer's day.

I'm afraid you've got some sore sickness, Or have lain wi some young man, man, Or have lain wi some young man.’ 3 ‘O I have got no sore sickness, Nor I've lain with no young man; But the thing that grieves me to the heart Is my true-love is staying too long.’ That my true-love, etc. 4 ‘O is he a lord, or a duke, or a knight, Or a man of birth or fame? Or is he one of my own servant-men, That is lately come from Spain?’ 5 ‘He's neither a lord, nor a duke, nor a knight, Nor a man of birth or fame; But he is one of your own servant-men, That is lately come from Spain.’ 6 ‘O call him down, the Spanish dog, O call him down to me, For before eight o'clock next morning Hanged he shall be, be, Aye, hanged on a tree.’ 7 ‘It's oh forbid, dear father,’ she said, ‘That anything there should be, For if that you hang John Barborough, You'll get nae mair good o me.’ 8 He's called down his merry men all, By one and by two and by three; John Barborough was to be the first, But the last man down came he. 9 For every pound that he laid down, John Barborough laid down three. 101 WILLIE O DOUGLAS DALE Willy o Douglass-dale WILLIE O DOUGLAS DALE—A Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 8. 1 O Willy was as brave a lord As ever saild the sea, And he has gane to the English court, To serve for meat and fee. 2 He had nae been at the kingis court A twelvemonth and a day, Till he longd for a sight o the king's daughter, But ane he coud never see. 3 O it fell ance upon a day To the green wood she has gane, An Willy he has followd her, With the clear light o the moon. 4 He looted him low, by her did go, Wi his hat intill his hand: ‘O what's your will wi me, Sir Knight?

I'll carry you unto fair Scotland, And mak you a lady free.’ 12 She pat her han in her pocket An gae him five hunder poun: ‘An take you that now, Squire Willy, Till awa that we do won.’ 13 Whan day was gane, and night was come, She lap the castle-wa; But Willy kepit his gay lady, He was laith to let her fa. 14 Whan night was gane, an day come in, An lions gaed to their dens, An ay the lady followd him, An the tears came hailing down. 15 ‘O want ye ribbons to your hair?

Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 181; Motherwell's MS., p. 619. 1 Willie was an earl's ae son, And an earl's ae son was he, But he thought his father lack to sair, And his mother of low degree. 2 But he is on to fair England, To sair for meat an fee, And all was for Dame Oliphant, A woman of great beauty. 3 He hadna been in fair England A month but barely ane, Ere he dreamd that fair Dame Oliphant Gied him a gay gold ring. 4 He hadna been in fair England A month but barely four, Ere he dreamd that fair Dame Oliphant Gied him a red rose flower, Well set about with white lilies, Like to the paramour. 5 It fell ance upon a day Dame Oliphant thought lang, And she gaed on to good green wood, As fast as she could gang. 6 As Willie stood in his chamber-door, And as he thought it good, There he beheld Dame Oliphant, As she came thro the wood. 7 He's taen his bow his arm oer, His sword into his hand, And he is on to good green wood, As fast as he could gang. 8 And there he found Dame Oliphant, Was lying sound asleep, And aye the sounder she did sleep The nearer he did creep. 9 But when she wakend from her sleep An angry maid was she, Crying, Had far away frae me, young man, Had far away frae me! For I fear ye are the Scottish knight That beguiles young ladies free. 10 ‘I am not the Scottish knight, Nor ever thinks to be; I am but Willie o Douglass Dale, That serves for meat an fee.’ 11 ‘If ye be Willie o Douglass Dale, Ye're dearly welcome to me; For oft in my sleep have I thought on You and your merry winking ee.’ 12 But the cocks they crew, and the horns blew, And the lions took the hill, And Willie he gaed hame again, To his hard task and till; And likewise did Dame Oliphant, To her book and her seam. 13 Till it fell ance upon a day Dame Oliphant thought lang, And she went on to Willie's bower-yates, As fast as she could gang. 14 ‘O are ye asleep now, Squire Willie? O are you asleep?’ said she; O waken, waken, Squire Willie, O waken, and speak to me. 15 ‘For the gowns that were oer wide, Willie, They winna meet on me, And the coats that were oer side, Willie, They winna come to my knee; And if the knights of my father's court get word, I'm sure they'll gar you die.’ 16 But she's taen a web of the scarlet, And she tare it fine an sma, And even into Willie's arms She leapt the castle-wa; And Willie was wight and well able, And he keept her frae a fa. 17 But the cocks they crew, and the horns blew, And the lions took the hill, And Willie's ladie followed him, And the tears did twinkle still. 18 ‘O want ye ribbons to your hair? Or roses to your sheen? Or want ye chains about your neck? Ye'se get mair ere that be deen.’ 19 ‘I want not ribbons to my hair, Nor roses to my sheen, And there's mair chains about my neck Nor ever I'll see deen; But I have as much dear bought love As my heart can contain.’ 20 ‘Will ye go to the cards or dice? Or to the table ee? Or to a bed, so well down spread, And sleep till it be day?’ 21 ‘I've mair need of the roddins, Willie, That grow on yonder thorn; Likewise a drink o Marywell water, Out of your grass-green horn. 22 ‘I've mair need of a fire, Willie, To had me frae the cauld; Likewise a glass of your red wine, Ere I bring my son to the fauld.’ 23 He's got a bush o roddins till her, That grows on yonder thorn; Likewise a drink o Marywell water, Out of his grass-green horn. 24 He carried the match in his pocket That kindled to her the fire, Well set about wi oaken spells, That leamd oer Lincolnshire. 25 And he has bought to his lady The white bread and the wine; And the milk he milked from the goats, He fed his young son on. 26 Till it fell ance upon a day Dame Oliphant thought lang: ‘O gin ye hae a being, Willie, I pray ye hae me hame.’ 27 He's taen his young son in his arms, His lady by the hand, And they're down thro good green wood, As fast as they could gang. 28 Till they came to a shepherd-may, Was feeding her flocks alone; Said, Will ye gae alang wi me, And carry my bonny young son? 29 The gowns that were shapen for my back, They shall be sewd for thine; And likewise I'll gar Squire Willie Gie you a braw Scotsman. 30 When they came on to Willie's boweryates, And far beyont the sea, She was haild the lady o Douglass Dale, And Willie an earl to be: Likewise the maid they brought awa, She got a braw Scotsman.

I dreamt I saw my daughter dear Drown in the saut sea flood. 13 ‘But gin my daughter be dead or sick, Or yet be stown awa, I mak a vow, and I'll keep it true, I'll hang ye ane and a'!’ 14 They sought her back, they sought her fore, They sought her up and down; They got her in the gude green wood, Nursing her bonny young son. 15 He took the bonny boy in his arms, And kist him tenderlie; Says, Though I would your father hang, Your mother's dear to me. 16 He kist him oer and oer again: ‘My grandson I thee claim, And Robin Hood in gude green wood, And that shall be your name.’ 17 And mony ane sings o grass, o grass, And mony ane sings o corn, And mony ane sings o Robin Hood Kens little whare he was born. 18 It wasna in the ha, the ha, Nor in the painted bower, But it was in the gude green wood, Amang the lily-flower. The Birth of Robin Hood WILLIE AND EARL RICHARD'S DAUGHTER—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 1. 1 Mony ane talks o the grass, the grass, And mony ane o the corn, And mony ane talks o gude Robin Hood Kens little whar he was born. 2 He was gotten in a earl's ha, And in a lady's bower, And born into gude greenwood, Thro mony cauld winter's shower. 3 His father was the earl's own steward, Sprung frae sma pedigree; His mother, Earl Huntingdon's ae daughter, For he had nane else but she. 4 When nine months were near an end, And eight months they were gone, The lady's cheeks wi tears were wet, And thus she made her moan: 5 ‘What shall I say, my love Archibald, This day for you and me? I will be laid in cauld irons, And ye'll be hanged on tree.’ 6 ‘What aileth my love Clementina? What gars you mourn sae sair?’ ‘You know,’ said she, ‘I'm with child to thee, These eight lang months and mair.’ 7 ‘Will ye gae to my mother's bower, Stands on yon stately green? Or will ye gae to the gude greenwood, Where ye will not be seen?’ 8 ‘I winna gang to your mother's bower, Stands on yon stately green; But I will on to gude greenwood, As fast as they could gang. 9 He's girt his sword down by his side, Took his lady by the hand, And they are on thro gude greenwood, As fast as they could gang. 10 With slowly steps these couple walkd, About miles scarcely three. When this lady, being sair wearied out, Lay down beneath a tree. 11 ‘O for a few of yon junipers, To cheer my heart again, And likewise for a gude midwife, To ease me of my pain!’ 12 ‘I'll bring to you yon junipers, To cheer your heart again, And I'll be to you a gude midwife, To ease you of your pain.’ 13 ‘Had far awa frae me, Archibald, For this will never dee; That's nae the fashion o our land, And it's nae be used by me. 14 ‘Ye'll take your small-sword by your side, Your buckler and your bow, And ye'll gae down thro gude greenwood, And hunt the deer and roe. 15 ‘You will stay in gude greenwood, And with the chase go on, Until yon white hind pass you by, Then straight to me ye'll come.’ 16 He's girt his sword then by his side, His buckler and his bow, And he is on thro gude greenwood, To hunt the deer and roe. 17 And in the greenwood he did stay, And with the chase gaed on, Until the white hind passd him by, Then to his love he came. 18 He girt his sword then by his side, Fast thro greenwood went he, And there he found his love lie dead, Beneath the green oak tree. 19 The sweet young babe that she had born Right lively seemed to be; ‘Ohon, alas!’ said young Archibald, ‘A mournful scene to me! 20 ‘Altho my sweet babe is alive, This does increase my woe; How to nourish a motherless babe Is mair than I do know.’ 21 He looked east, he looked west, To see what he could see, Then spied the Earl o Huntingdon, And mony a man him wi. 22 Then Archibald fled from the earl's face, Among the leaves sae green, That he might hear what might be said, And see, and nae be seen. 23 The earl straight thro the greenwood came, Unto the green oak tree, And there he saw his daughter dead, Her living child her wi. 24 Then he's taen up the little boy, Rowed him in his gown-sleeve; Said, Tho your father's to my loss, Your mother's to me leave. 25 And if ye live until I die, My bowers and lands ye'se heir; You are my only daughter's child; But her I never had mair. 26 Ye'se hae all kinds of nourishment, And likewise nurses three; If I knew where the fause knave were, High hanged should he be. 27 His daughter he buried in gude church-yard, All in a mournful mood, And brought the boy to church that day, And christend him Robin Hood. 28 This boy was bred in the earl's ha Till he became a man, But loved to hunt in gude greenwood, To raise his noble fame.

Then out it spake him Brown Robin, But that's a woman's moan! 19 ‘O ken ye by my red rose lip? Or by my yallow hair? Or ken ye by my milk-white breast? For ye never saw it bare?’ 20 ‘I ken no by your red rose lip, Nor by your yallow hair; Nor ken I by your milk-white breast, For I never saw it bare; But come to your bowr whaever sae likes, Will find a lady there.’ 21 ‘O gin ye come to my bowr within, Thro fraud, deceit, or guile, Wi this same bran that's in my han, I swear I will the kill.’ 22 ‘But I will come thy bowr within, An spear nae leave,’ quoth he; ‘An this same bran that's i my han I sall ware back on the.’ 23 About the tenth hour of the night The ladie's bower-door was broken, An eer the first hour of the day The bonny knave-bairn was gotten. 24 When days were gane, and months were run, The lady took travailing, And sair she cry'd for a bowr-woman, For to wait her upon. 25 Then out it spake him Brown Robin: Now what needs a' this din? For what coud any woman do But I coud do the same? 26 ‘'Twas never my mither's fashion,’ she says, ‘Nor sall it ever be mine, That belted knights shoud eer remain Where ladies dreed their pine. 27 ‘But ye take up that bugle-horn, An blaw a blast for me; I ha a brother i the kingis court Will come me quickly ti.’ 28 ‘O gin ye ha a brither on earth That ye love better nor me, Ye blaw the horn yoursel,’ he says, ‘For ae blast I winna gie.’ 29 She's set the horn till her mouth, And she's blawn three blasts sae shrill; Sweet Willy heard i the kingis court, And came her quickly till. 30 Then up it started Brown Robin, An an angry man was he: ‘There comes nae man this bowr within But first must fight wi me.’ 31 O they hae fought that bowr within Till the sun was gaing down, Till drops o blude frae Rose the Red Came hailing to the groun. 32 She leand her back against the wa, Says, Robin, let a' be; For it is a lady born and bred That's foughten sae well wi thee. 33 O seven foot he lap a back; Says, Alas, and wae is me! I never wisht in a' my life, A woman's blude to see; An a' for the sake of ae fair maid Whose name was White Lilly. 34 Then out it spake her White Lilly, An a hearty laugh laugh she: She's lived wi you this year an mair, Tho ye kentna it was she. 35 Now word has gane thro a' the lan, Before a month was done, That Brown Robin's man, in good green wood, Had born a bonny young son. 36 The word has gane to the kingis court, An to the king himsel; ‘Now, by my fay,’ the king could say, ‘The like was never heard tell!’ 37 Then out it spake him Bold Arthur, An a hearty laugh laugh he: I trow some may has playd the loun, And fled her ain country. 38 ‘Bring me my steed,’ then cry'd the king, ‘My bow and arrows keen; I'l ride mysel to good green wood, An see what's to be seen.’ 39 ‘An't please your grace,’ said Bold Arthur, ‘My liege, I'll gang you wi, An try to fin a little foot-page, That's strayd awa frae me.’ 40 O they've hunted i the good green wood The buck but an the rae, An they drew near Brown Robin's bowr, About the close of day. 41 Then out it spake the king in hast, Says, Arthur, look an see Gin that be no your little foot-page That leans against yon tree. 42 Then Arthur took his bugle-horn, An blew a blast sae shrill; Sweet Willy started at the sound, An ran him quickly till. 43 ‘O wanted ye your meat, Willy? Or wanted ye your fee? Or gat ye ever an angry word, That ye ran awa frae me?’ 44 ‘I wanted nought, my master dear; To me ye ay was good; I came but to see my ae brother, That wons in this green wood.’ 45 Then out it spake the king again, Says, Bonny boy, tell to me Wha lives into yon bigly bowr, Stands by yon green oak tree? 46 ‘O pardon me,’ says Sweet Willy, ‘My liege, I dare no tell; An I pray you go no near that bowr, For fear they do you fell.’ 47 ‘O haud your tongue, my bonny boy, For I winna be said nay; But I will gang that bowr within, Betide me well or wae.’ 48 They've lighted off their milk-white steeds, An saftly enterd in, An there they saw her White Lilly, Nursing her bonny yong son. 49 ‘Now, by the rood,’ the king coud say, ‘This is a comely sight; I trow, instead of a forrester's man, This is a lady bright!’ 50 Then out it spake her Rose the Red, An fell low down on her knee: O pardon us, my gracious liege, An our story I'll tell thee. 51 Our father was a wealthy lord, That wond in Barnsdale; But we had a wicked step-mother, That wrought us meickle bale. 52 Yet she had twa as fu fair sons As ever the sun did see, An the tane o them lood my sister dear, An the tither sayd he lood me. 53 Then out it spake him Bold Arthur, As by the king he stood: Now, by the faith o my body, This shoud be Rose the Red! 54 Then in it came him Brown Robin, Frae hunting o the deer, But whan he saw the king was there, He started back for fear. 55 The king has taen him by the hand, An bade him naithing dread; Says, Ye maun leave the good green wood, Come to the court wi speed. 56 Then up he took White Lilly's son, An set him on his knee; Says, Gin ye live to wiald a bran, My bowman ye sall bee. 57 The king he sent for robes of green, An girdles o shinning gold; He gart the ladies be arrayd Most comely to behold. 58 They've done them unto Mary Kirk, An there gat fair wedding, An fan the news spread oer the lan, For joy the bells did ring. 59 Then out it spake her Rose the Red, An a hearty laugh laugh she: I wonder what would our step-dame say, Gin she this sight did see! Rose the Red and White Lillie ROSE THE RED AND WHITE LILY—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 67. 1 Now word is gane thro a' the land, Gude seal that it sae spread! To Rose the Red and White Lillie, Their mither dear was dead. 2 Their father's married a bauld woman, And brought her ower the sea, Twa sprightly youths, her ain young sons, Intill her companie. 3 They fixd their eyes on those ladies, On shipboard as they stood, And sware, if ever they wan to land, These ladies they woud wed. 4 But there was nae a quarter past, A quarter past but three, Till these young luvers a' were fond O other's companie. 5 The knights they harped i their bower, The ladies sewd and sang; There was mair mirth in that chamer Than a' their father's lan. 6 Then out it spak their step-mither, At the stair-foot stood she: I'm plagued wi your troublesome noise! What makes your melodie? 7 O Rose the Red, ye sing too loud, White Lillie, your voice is strang; But gin I live and brook my life, I'se gar you change your sang. 8 ‘We maunna change our loud, loud song For nae duke's son ye'll bear; We winna change our loud, loud song, But aye we'll sing the mair. 9 ‘We never sung the sang, mither, But we'll sing ower again; We'll take our harps into our hands, And we'll harp, and we'll sing.’ 10 She's calld upon her twa young sons, Says, Boun ye for the sea; Let Rose the Red and White Lillie Stay in their bower wi me. 11 ‘O God forbid,’ said her eldest son, ‘Nor lat it ever be, Unless ye were as kind to our luves As gin we were them wi.’ 12 ‘Yet never the less, my pretty sons, Ye'll boun you for the faem; Let Rose the Red and White Lillie Stay in their bowers at hame.’ 13 ‘O when wi you we came alang, We felt the stormy sea, And where we go, ye neer shall know, Nor shall be known by thee.’ 14 Then wi her harsh and boisterous word She forc'd these lads away, While Rose the Red and White Lillie Still in their bowers did stay. 15 But there was not a quarter past, A quarter past but ane, Till Rose the Red in rags she gaed, White Lillie's claithing grew thin. 16 Wi bitter usage every day, The ladies they thought lang; ‘Ohon, alas!’ said Rose the Red, ‘She's gard us change our sang. 17 ‘But we will change our own fu names, And we'll gang frae the town, Frae Rose the Red and White Lillie To Nicholas and Roger Brown. 18 ‘And we will cut our green claithing A little aboon our knee, And we will on to gude greenwood, Twa bauld bowmen to be.’ 19 ‘Ohon, alas!’ said White Lillie, ‘My fingers are but sma, And tho my hands woud wield the bow, They winna yield at a'.’ 20 ‘O had your tongue now, White Lillie, And lat these fears a' be; There's naething that ye're awkward in But I will learn thee.’ 21 Then they are on to gude greenwood, As fast as gang coud they; O then they spied him Robin Hood, Below a green aik tree. 22 ‘Gude day, gude day, kind sir,’ they said, ‘God make you safe and free:’ ‘Gude day, gude day,’ said Robin Hood, ‘What is your wills wi me?’ 23 ‘Lo here we are, twa banishd knights, Come frae our native hame; We're come to crave o thee service, Our king will gie us nane.’ 24 ‘If ye be twa young banishd knights, Tell me frae what countrie:’ ‘Frae Anster town into Fifeshire; Ye know it as well as we.’ 25 ‘If a' be true that ye hae said, And tauld just now to me, Ye're welcome, welcome, every one; Your master I will be. 26 ‘Now ye shall eat as I do eat, And lye as I do lye; Ye salna wear nae waur claithing Nor my young men and I.’ 27 Then they went to a ruinous house, And there they enterd in, And Nicholas fed wi Robin Hood, And Roger wi Little John. 28 But it fell ance upon a day They were at the putting-stane, Whan Rose the Red she viewd them a', As they stood on the green. 29 She hit the stane then wi her foot, And kepd it wi her knee, And spaces three aboon them a' I wyte she gard it flee. 30 She sat her back then to a tree, And gae a loud Ohon! A lad spak in the companie, I hear a woman's moan. 31 ‘How know you that, young man?’ she said, ‘How know you that o me? Did eer ye see me in that place Ae foot my ground to flee? 32 ‘Or know ye by my cherry cheeks? Or by my yellow hair? Or by the paps on my breast-bane? Ye never saw them bare.’ 33 ‘I know not by your cherry cheeks, Nor by your yellow hair; But I know by your milk-white chin, On it there grows nae hair. 34 ‘I never saw you in that cause Ae foot your ground to flee; I've seen you stan wi sword in han Mang men's blood to the knee. 35 ‘But if I come your bower within, By night, or yet by day, I shall know before I go If ye be man or may.’ 36 ‘O if you come my bower within, By night, or yet by day, As soon's I draw my trusty brand, Nae lang ye'll wi me stay.’ 37 But he is haunted to her bower, Her bigly bower o stane, Till he has got her big wi bairn, And near sax months she's gane. 38 Whan three mair months were come and gane, They gaed to hunt the hynde; She wont to be the foremost ane, But now stayd far behynd. 39 Her luver looks her in the face, And thus to her said he; I think your cheeks are pale and wan; Pray, what gaes warst wi thee? 40 O want ye roses to your breast? Or ribbons to your sheen? Or want ye as muckle o dear bought luve As your heart can conteen? 41 ‘I want nae roses to my breast, Nae ribbons to my sheen; Nor want I as muckle dear bought luve As my heart can conteen. 42 ‘I'd rather hae a fire behynd, Anither me before, A gude midwife at my right side, Till my young babe be bore.’ 43 ‘I'll kindle a fire wi a flint-stane, Bring wine in a green horn; I'll be midwife at your right side, Till your young babe be born.’ 44 ‘That was neer my mither's custom, Forbid that it be mine! A knight stan by a lady bright Whan she drees a' her pine. 45 ‘There is a knight in gude greenwood, If that he kent o me, Thro stock and stane and the hawthorn Sae soon's he woud come me tee.’ 46 ‘If there be a knight in gude greenwood Ye like better than me, If ance he come your bower within, Ane o us twa shall dee.’ 47 She set a horn to her mouth, And she blew loud and shrill; Thro stock and stane and the hawthorn Brave Roger came her till. 48 ‘Wha's here sae bauld,’ the youth replied, ‘Thus to encroach on me?’ ‘O here I am,’ the knight replied, ‘Hae as much right as thee.’ 49 Then they fought up the gude greenwood, Sae did they down the plain; They niddart ither wi lang braid-swords, Till they were bleedy men. 50 Then out it spak the sick woman, Sat under the greenwood tree; O had your han, young man, she said, She's a woman as well as me. 51 Then out it speaks anither youth, Amang the companie; Gin I had kent what I ken now, 'Tis for her I woud dee. 52 ‘O wae mat worth you, Rose the Red, An ill death mat ye dee! Altho ye tauld upo yoursell, Ye might hae heald on me.’ 53 ‘O for her sake I was content For to gae ower the sea; For her I left my mither's ha, Tho she proves fause to me.’ 54 But whan these luvers were made known, They sung right joyfullie, Nae blyther was the nightingale, Nor bird that sat on tree. 55 Now they hae married these ladies, Brought them to bower and ha; And now a happy life they lead; I wish sae may we a'. The Wedding of Robin Hood and Little John ROSE THE RED AND WHITE LILY—C Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, annotated by the editor, p. 69. 1 The king has wedded an ill woman, Into some foreign land; His daughters twa, that stood in awe, They bravely sat and sang. 2 Then in became their step-mother, Sae stately stepping ben: ‘O gin I live and bruik my life, I'll gar ye change your tune.’ 3 ‘O we sang neer that sang, ladie, But we will sing again; And ye neer boor that son, ladie, We wad lay our love on. 4 ‘But we will cow our yellow locks A little abune our bree, And we will on to gude greenwud, And serve for meat and fee. 5 ‘And we will kilt our gay claithing A little below the knee, And we will on to gude greenwud, Gif Robin Hood we see. 6 ‘And we will change our ain twa names, When we gae frae the toun; The tane we will call Nicholas, The tither Rogee Roun.’ 7 Then they hae cowd their yellow locks A little abune their bree, And they are on to gude greenwud, To serve for meat and fee. 8 And they hae kilt their gay claithing A little below their knee, And they are on to gud greenwud, Gif Robin Hood they see. 9 And they hae chang'd thair ain twa names, Whan they gaed frae the toun; The tane they've called Nicholas, The tither Rogee Roun. 10 And they hae staid in gude greenwud, And never a day thoucht lang, Till it fell ance upon a day That Rogee sang a sang. 11 ‘Whan we were in our father's bouer, We sewd the silken seam; But now we walk the gude greenwud, And bear anither name. 12 ‘When we were in our father's ha, We wore the beaten gold; But now we wear the shield sae sharp; Alas, we'll die with cold!’ 13 Then up bespak him Robin Hood, As he to them drew near: ‘Instead of boys to carry the bow, Two ladies we've got here.’ 14 So they had not been in gud greenwud A twalmonth and a day, Till Rogee Roun was as big wi bairn As onie lady could gae. 15 ‘O wae be to my stepmother, That garrd me leave my hame! For I'm wi bairn to Robin Hood, And near nine month is gane. 16 ‘O wha will be my bouer-woman? Na bouer-woman is here; O wha will be my bouer-woman, Whan that sad time draws near?’ 17 Then up bespak him Robin Hood, At the foot o yon greenwud tree: O hold your tongue, fair Rogee Roun, For married ye sall be. 18 The tane was wedded to Robin Hood, And the tither to Little John; And it was a' owing to their stepmother, That garrd them leave their hame. 104 PRINCE HEATHEN The Disconsolate Lady PRINCE HEATHEN—A The Jovial Rake's Garland, n. d., p. 6, No 4, Bodleian Library, Douce PP, 164. 1 Lady Margery May sits in her bower, Sewing at her seem; By there comes a heathen knight, From her her maidenhead has tane. 2 He has put her in a tower strong, With double locks on fifty doors: ‘Lady Margery May, will you ga now?’ ‘O ye heathen knight, not yet for you. 3 ‘I am asking, you heathen knight; What I am asking will you grant to me? Will ye let one of your waitmen A drink of your well bring to me?’ 4 ‘Meat nor drink you shall never get, Nor out of that shall you never come, Meat nor drink shall you never get, Until you bear to me daughter or son.’ 5 Thus time drew on, and further on, For travail came this young lady to; She travailed up, so did she down, But lighter could she never be. 6 ‘An asking, an asking, you heathen knight; An asking will you grant to me? Will you give me a scread of silk, For to row your young son wi?’ 7 He took the horse-sheet in his hand, The tears came twinkling down: ‘Lady Margaret May, will ye ga now?’ ‘O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.’ 8 ‘I'll wash my young son with the milk, I will dry my young son with the silk; For hearts will break, and bands will bow; So dear will I love my lady now!’ Prince Heathen PRINCE HEATHEN—B Buchan's MSS, I, 97; Motherwell's MS., p. 665. 1 Lady Margaret sat in her bower-door, Sewing at her silken seem, When by it came Prince Heathen then, An gae to her a gay gold ring. 2 He turnd about, an gied a bow; She said, Begone, I love na you; When he sware by his yellow hair That he woud gar her greet fu sair. 3 But she sware by her milk-white skin Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane: ‘O bonny may, winna ye greet now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.’ 4 He's taen her in his arms twa, Laid her between him an the wa, An ere he let her free again, Her maidenhead frae her he's taen. ‘O bonny may, winna ye greet now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.’ 5 ‘I killd your father in his bed, And your gay mother by his side, And your seven brothers, ane by ane, And they were seven pretty men. O bonny may, winna ye greet now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.’ 6 ‘I'll put you in a vault o stone, Where five an thirty locks hing on; Naebody there then shall you see, For I will keep the keys wi me. O bonny may, winna ye greet now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.’ 7 He's put her in a vault o stone, Where five an thirty locks hing on; Naebody there coud eer her see, Prince Heathen kept the keys him wi. But ae she cried, What shall I do! The heathenish dog has gart me rue. 8 Prince Heathen from the mountains came, Attended by his armed men, And he's gane to the bonny may, And to the prison where she lay: ‘O bonny may, what do you now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.’ 9 ‘I'll take you out upon the green, Where women ye shall neer see ane, But only me and my young men, Till ye bring daughter hame or son. O bonny may, what do you now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.’ 10 He's taen her out upon the green, Where she saw women never ane, But only him and's merry young men, Till she brought hame a bonny young son. ‘O bonny may, what do you now?’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, dying for you. 11 ‘A drink, a drink, frae Prince Heathen's hand, Though it were frae yon cauld well strong!’ ‘O neer a drap, Prince Heathen,’ said one, ‘Till ye row up your bonny young son.’ ‘How can I row up my bonny young son, When I hae naething to row him in?’ 12 ‘I will lend you my horse's sheet, That will row him baith head and feet.’ As soon's she took it in her han, Tears oer her cheeks down rapping ran. ‘O bonny may, ye do greet now:’ ‘Ye heathenish dog, but nae for you. 13 ‘But a' is for my bonny young son; Your sheets are rough to row him in; Ohon, alas, sair may I rue That eer I saw such rogues as you!’ 14 ‘Ye'll row my young son in the silk, An ye will wash him wi the milk, An lay my lady very saft, That I may see her very aft.’ When hearts are broken, bands will bow; Sae well's he loved his lady now! 105 THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER OF ISLINGTON THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER OF ISLINGTON a.

An Aldermary Churchyard copy. 1 There was a youth, and a well belovd youth, And he was a esquire's son, He loved the bayliff's daughter dear, That lived in Islington. 2 She was coy, and she would not believe That he did love her so, No, nor at any time she would Any countenance to him show. 3 But when his friends did understand His fond and foolish mind, They sent him up to fair London, An apprentice for to bind. 4 And when he had been seven long years, And his love he had not seen, ‘Many a tear have I shed for her sake When she little thought of me.’ 5 All the maids of Islington Went forth to sport and play; All but the bayliff's daughter dear; She secretly stole away. 6 She put off her gown of gray, And put on her puggish attire; She's up to fair London gone, Her true-love to require. 7 As she went along the road, The weather being hot and dry, There was she aware of her true-love, At length came riding by. 8 She stept to him, as red as any rose, And took him by the bridle-ring: ‘I pray you, kind sir, give me one penny, To ease my weary limb.’ 9 ‘I prithee, sweetheart, canst thou tell me Where that thou wast born?’ ‘At Islington, kind sir,’ said she, ‘Where I have had many a scorn.’ 10 ‘I prithee, sweetheart, canst thou tell me Whether thou dost know The bailiff's daughter of Islington?’ ‘She's dead, sir, long ago.’ 11 ‘Then will I sell my goodly steed, My saddle and my bow; I will into some far countrey, Where no man doth me know.’ 12 ‘O stay, O stay, thou goodly youth! She's alive, she is not dead; Here she standeth by thy side, And is ready to be thy bride.’ 13 ‘O farewel grief, and welcome joy, Ten thousand times and more!

A Collection of Old Ballads, I, 216, 1723. 1 You beautious ladies, great and small, I write unto you one and all, Whereby that you may understand What I have suffered in this land. 2 I was by birth a lady fair, My father's chief and onely heir, But when my good old father dy'd, Then was I made a young knight's bride. 3 And then my love built me a bower, Bedeckt with many a fragrant flower; A braver bower you never did see Then my true-love did build for me. 4 But there came thieves late in the night, They rob'd my bower, and slew my knight, And after that my knight was slain, I could no longer there remain. 5 My servants all from me did flye, In the midst of my extremity, And left me by my self alone, With a heart more cold then any stone. 6 Yet, though my heart was full of care, Heaven would not suffer me to despair; Wherefore in hast I chang'd my name From Fair Elise to Sweet William. 7 And therewithal I cut my hair, And drest my self in man's attire, My doublet, hose, and bever-hat, And a golden band about my neck. 8 With a silver rapier by my side, So like a gallant I did ride; The thing that I delighted on, Was for to be a serving-man. 9 Thus in my sumptuous man's array, I bravely rode along the way; And at the last it chanced so That I unto the king's court did go. 10 Then to the king I bowed full low, My love and duty for to show, And so much favour I did crave That I a serving-man's place might have. 11 ‘Stand up, brave youth, the king replyd, ‘Thy service shall not be denyd; But tell me first what thou canst do; Thou shalt be fitted thereunto. 12 ‘Wilt thou be usher of my hall, To wait upon my nobles all? Or wilt thou be taster of my wine, To wait on me when I shall dine? 13 ‘Or wilt thou be my chamberlain, To make my bed both soft and fine? Or wilt thou be one of my guard? And I will give thee thy reward.’ 14 Sweet William, with a smiling face, Said to the king, If't please your grace To show such favour unto me, Your chamberlain I fain would be. 15 The king then did the nobles call, To ask the counsel of them all, Who gave consent Sweet William he The king's own chamberlain should be. 16 Now mark what strange things came to pass: As the king one day a hunting was, With all his lords and noble train, Sweet William did at home remain. 17 Sweet William had no company then With him at home but an old man; And when he saw the coast was clear, He took a lute which he had there. 18 Upon the lute Sweet William plaid, And to the same he sung and said, With a pleasant and most noble voice, Which made the old man to rejoyce: 19 ‘My father was as brave a lord As ever Europe did afford; My mother was a lady bright, My husband was a valiant knight. 20 ‘And I my self a lady gay, Bedeckt with gorgeous rich array; The bravest lady in the land Had not more pleasures to command. 21 ‘I had my musick every day, Harmonious lessons for to play; I had my virgins fair and free, Continually to wait on me. 22 ‘But now, alas! my husband's dead, And all my friends are from me fled; My former joys are past and gone, For now I am a serving-man.’ 23 At last the king from hunting came, And presently upon the same He called for the good old man, And thus to speak the king began. 24 ‘What news, what news, old man?’ quod he; ‘What news hast thou to tell to me?’ ‘Brave news,’ the old man he did say; ‘Sweet William is a lady gay.’ 25 ‘If this be true thou tellest me I'le make thee a lord of high degree; But if thy words do prove a lye, Thou shalt be hanged up presently.’ 26 But when the king the truth had found, His joys did more and more abound; According as the old man did say, Sweet William was a lady gay. 27 Therefore the king without delay Put on her glorious rich array, And upon her head a crown of gold, Which was most famous to behold. 28 And then, for fear of further strife, He took Sweet William for his wife; The like before was never seen, A serving-man to be a queen. 107 WILL STEWART AND JOHN Will Stewart and Iohn WILL STEWART AND JOHN—A Percy MS., p. 428; Hales and Furnivall, III, 216. 1 Adlatts parke is wyde and broad, And grasse growes greene in our countrye; Eche man can gett the loue of his ladye, But alas, I can gett none of mine! 2 Itt's by two men I sing my song, Their names is William Stewart and Iohn; William he is the elder brother, But Iohn hee is the wiser man. 3 But William he is in care-bed layd, And for the loue of a ffaire ladye; If he haue not the loue of the Erle of Mar's daughter, In ffaith ffor loue that he must dye. 4 Then Iohn was sorry ffor his brother, To see him lye and languish soe: ‘What doe you mourne for, brother?’ he saies, ‘I pray you tell to me your woe. 5 ‘Doe [you] mourne for gold, brother?’ he saies, ‘Or doe you mourne ffor ffee? Or doe you mourne for a likesome ladye, You neuer saw her with your eye?’ 6 ‘I doe not mourne for gold,’ he saies, ‘Nor I doe not mourne for any ffee; But I doe mourne for a likesome ladye, I neere blinke on her with mine eye.’ 7 ‘But when haruest is gotten, my deere brother — All this is true that I tell thee — Gentlemen, they loue hunting well, And giue wight-men their cloth and ffee. 8 ‘Then I'le goe a wooing ffor thy sake, In all the speed that I can gone, And for to see this likesome ladye, And hope to send thee good tydings home.’ 9 Iohn Stewart is gone a wooing for his brother, Soe ffarr into ffaire Scottland, And left his brother in mikle ffeare, Vntill he heard the good tydand. 10 And when he came to the Erle of Mar's his house, Soe well he could his curtesye, And when he came before the erle, He kneeled low downe vpon his knee. 11 ‘O rise vp, rise vp, Iohn Steward, Rise vp, now, I doe bidd thee; How doth thy ffather, Iohn Stewart, And all the lords in his countrye?’ 12 ‘And itt please you, my lord, my ffather is dead; My brother and I cannott agree; My brother and I am ffallen att discord, And I am come to craue a service of thee.’ 13 ‘O welcome, welcome, Iohn Stewart, A welcome man thou art to me; I'le make thee chamberlaine to my daughter, And ffor to tend of that ladye soe ffree. 14 ‘And if thou wilt haue a better office, Aske, and thou shall haue itt of mee; And where I giue other men a penny of wage, Inffaith, Iohn, thou shalt haue three.’ 15 And then bespake him Iohn Stewart, And these were the words said hee: There is no office in your court This day that better pleaseth mee. 16 The Ffryday is gone, the Sunday is come — All this is true that I doe say — And to the church that they be gone, Iohn Stewart and the lady gay. 17 And as they did come home againe — I-wis itt was a meeten mile — Iohn Stewart and the lady gay, They thought itt but a [little] while. 18 ‘I am a messenger, ladye,’ he saies, ‘I am a messenger to thee:’ ‘O speake ffor thy selfe, Iohn Stewart,’ shee saies, ‘A welcome man that thou shalt bee.’ 19 ‘Nay, by my ffaith,’ saies Iohn Stewart, ‘Which euer, alas, that may not bee! He hath a higher degree in honour, Allas, ladye, then euer I! 20 ‘He is a lord now borne by birth, And an erle affter his ffather doth dye; His haire is yellow, his eyes beene gray; All this is true that I tell yee. 21 ‘He is ffine in the middle, and small in the wast, And pleasant in a woman's eye; And more nor this, he dyes for your loue, Therefore, lady, show some pittye.’ 22 ‘If this be soe,’ then saies the lady, ‘If this be true that thou tells mee, By my ffaith then, Iohn Stewart, I can loue him hartilye. 23 ‘Bidd him meete me att S? Patr[i]cke's Church On Sunday after S? Andrew's day; The fflower of Scottland will be there, And then begins our summer's play. 24 ‘And bidd him bring with him a hundred gunners, And rawnke ryders lett them bee, And lett them bee of the rankest ryders That be to be ffound in that countrye. 25 ‘They best and worst, and all in like, Bidd him cloth them in one liuerye; And ffor his men, greene is the best, And greene now lett their liueryes bee. 26 ‘And clothe himselfe in scarlett redd, That is soe seemlye ffor to see; Ffor scarlett is a ffaire coulour, And pleasant allwayes in a woman's eye. 27 ‘He must play sixteene games att ball, Against the men of this countrye, And if he winn the greater part, Then I shall love him more tenderlye.’ 28 What the lady said, Iohn Stewart writt, And to Argyle Castle sent it hee; And [when] Willie Steward saw the letter, Fforth of care-bed then lope hee. 29 Hee mustered together his merry men all, Hee mustered them soe louelilye; Hee thought hee had had scarson halfe a hundred, Then had hee eleuen score and three. 30 He chose fforth a hundred of the best That were to be ffound in that countrye, He cladd them all in one coulour, And greene i-wis their liueryes bee. 31 He cladd himselfe in scarlett redd, That is soe seemelye ffor to see; Ffor scarlett is a ffaire coulor, And seemlye in a woman's eye. 32 And then towards Patricke Church he went, With all his men in braue array, To gett a sight, if he might, And speake with his lady gay. 33 When they came to Patricke's churche, Shee kneeled downe by her mother trulye: ‘O mother, if itt please you to giue me leaue, The Stewart's horsse ffaine wold I see.’ 34 ‘I'le giue you leaue, my deere daughter, And I and my maide will goe with yee:’ The lady had rather haue gone her selfe Then haue had her mother's companye. 35 When they came before Willie Steward, Soe well hee cold his curtesye: ‘I wold kisse your daughter, ladye,’ he said, ‘And if your will that soe itt bee.’ 36 The ladye's mother was content To doe a straunger that curtesye; And when Willie had gotten a kisse, I-wis shee might haue teemed him three. 37 Sixteen games were plaid that day there — This is the truth as I doe say — Willie Stewart and his merry men, Thé carryed twelue of them away. 38 And when they games that they were done, And all they ffolkes away were gone But the Erle of Marr and William Stewart, The erle wold needs haue William home. 39 And when they came vnto the erle's howse, They walked to a garden greene; Ffor to confferr of their bussines, Into the garden they be gone. 40 ‘I loue your daughter,’ saies William Stewart, ‘But I cannott tell whether she loueth mee:’ ‘Marry, God defend,’ saies the Erle of Mar, ‘That euer soe that itt shold bee! 41 ‘I had rather a gallowes there was made, And hange thee ffor my daughter's sake; I had rather a ffyer were made att a stake, And burne thee ffor my daughter's sake! 42 ‘To chamber, to chamber, gay ladye,’ he saies, ‘In the deuill's name now I bidd thee! And thou gett thee not to the chamber soone, I'le beate thee before the Stewart's eye.’ 43 And then bespake William Stewart, These were the words said hee: ‘If thou beate thy daughter for my sake, Thou'st beate a hundred men and mee.’ 44 Then bespake Iohn Stewart — Lord! an angry man was hee — ‘O churle, if thou wouldest not haue macht with my brother, Thou might haue answerd him curteouslye.’ 45 ‘O hold thy peace, Iohn Stewart, And chamber thy words now, I bidd thee; If thou chamber not thy words soone, Thou'st loose a good service; soe shalt thou doe me.’ 46 ‘Marry! hang them that cares,’ saies Iohn Stewart, ‘Either ffor thy service or ffor thee; Services can I haue enoughe, But brethren wee must euer bee.’ 47 William Stewart and his brother Iohn, To Argyle Castle gon they bee; And when Willye came to Argyle Castle, Into care-bedd then lope hee. 48 A parlaiment att Edenborrow was made, The king and his nobles all mett there; Thé sent ffor William Stewart and Iohn, To come amongst the other peeres. 49 Their clothing was of scarlett redd, That was soe seemelye ffor to see; Blacke hatts, white ffeathers plewed with gold, And sett all on their heads trulye. 50 Their stockings were of twisted silke, With garters ffringed about with gold; Their shoes were of the cordevine, And all was comelye to behold. 51 And when they came to Edenborrowe, They called ffor Iohn Stewart and Willie: ‘I answer in a lord's roome,’ saies Will Stewart, ‘But an erle I hope to bee.’ 52 ‘Come downe, come downe,’ saies the Lord of Marr, ‘I knew not what was thy degree:’ ‘O churle, if I might not haue macht with thy daughter, Itt had not beene long of my degree. 53 ‘My ffather, hee is the king his brother, And then the king is vnckle to me; O churle, if I might not haue macht with thy daughter, Itt had not beene long of my degree.’ 54 ‘O hold your peace,’ then sayd the king, ‘Cozen William, I doe bidd thee; Infaith, cozen William, he loues you the worsse Because you are a-kinn to mee. 55 ‘I'le make thee an erle with a siluer wande, And adde more honors still to thee; Thy brother Ihon shall be a lord, Of the best att home in his countrye. 56 ‘Thy brother Kester shalbe a knight, Lands and liuings I will him giue, And still hee shall liue in court with mee, And I'le maintaine him whilest he doth liue.’ 57 And when the parlaiment was done, And all the ffolkes away were gone, Willye Stewart and Iohn his brother, To Argyle Castle they be gone. 58 But when they came to Argyle Castle, That was soe ffarr in that countrye, He thought soe much then of his loue That into care-bedd then lope hee. 59 Iohn Stewart did see his brother soe ill, Lord, in his heart that hee was woe! ‘I will goe wooing for thy sake Againe yonder gay ladye to. 60 ‘I'le cloth my selfe in strange array, In a beggar's habbitt I will goe, That when I come before the Erle of Marr My clothing strange he shall not knowe.’ 61 Iohn hee gott on a clouted cloake, Soe meete and low then by his knee, With four garters vpon one legg, Two aboue, and towe below trulye. 62 ‘But if thou be a beggar, brother, Thou art a beggar that is vnknowne; Ffor thou art one of the stoutest beggars That euer I saw since I was borne. 63 ‘Heere, geeue the lady this gay gold ringe, A token to her that well is knowne; And if shee but aduise itt well, Shee'le know some time itt was her owne.’ 64 ‘Stay, by my ffaith, I goe not yett,’ Iohn Stewart he can replye; ‘I'le haue my bottle ffull of beere, The best that is in thy butterye. 65 ‘I'le haue my sachell ffilld full of meate, I am sure, brother, [it] will doe noe harme; Ffor, before I come to the Erle of Marr's his house, My lipps, I am sure, they wilbe warme.’ 66 And when he came to the Erle of Marr's house, By chance itt was of the dole-day; But Iohn cold ffind no place to stand, Vntill he came to the ladye gaye. 67 But many a beggar he threw downe, And made them all with weeping say, He is the devill, hee is no beggar, That is come fforth of some strange countrye. 68 And now the dole that itt is delte, And all the beggars be gon away, Sauing Iohn Stewart, that seemed a beggar, And the ladye that was soe gay. 69 ‘Lady,’ sais Iohn, ‘I am no beggar, As by my clothes you may thinke that I bee; I am your servant, Iohn Stewart, And I am sent a messenger to thee.’ 70 ‘But if thou be Iohn Stewart, As I doe thinke that thou bee, Avayle thy capp, avayle thy hoode, And I will stand and speake to thee. 71 ‘How doth thy brother, Iohn Stewart, And all the lords in his countrye?’ ‘O ffye vpon thee, wicked woman! My brother he doth the worsse ffor thee.’ 72 With that the teares stood in her eyes; O lord, shee wept soe tenderlye! Sais, Ligg the blame vnto my ffather; I pray you, Iohn Stewart, lay itt not to mee. 73 Comend me to my owne true-loue, That liues soe farr in the North countrye, And bidd him meete me att Martingsdale, Ffullye w[i]thin these dayes three. 74 Hang them, sais the lady gay, That letts their ffather witting bee!

Ffor thou art hee that will lengthen my dayes, And I know thou art good companye. 17 Christopher, I am a merchant's wiffe; Christopher, the more shall be your gaine; Siluer and gold you shall haue enough, Of the merchant's gold that is in Spaine. 18 ‘But if you be a merchant's wiffe, Something tó much you are to blame; I will thee reade a loue-letter Shall sture thy stumpes, thou noble dame. 19 ‘Althoug I be a marchant's wiffe, shall mine and g Into England I'le goe with the.’ 20 They packet vp both siluer and plate, Siluer and gold soe great plentye, And they be gon into Litle England, And the marchant must them neuer see. 21 And when the merchants they came home, Their wiues to eche other can say, Heere hath beene good Christopher White, And he hath tane thy wiffe away. 22 They haue packett vp spoone and plate, Siluer and gold great plenty, And they be gon into Litle England, And them againe thow must neuer see. 23 ‘I care nott ffor my siluer and gold, Nor for my plate soe great plentye, But I mourne for that like-some ladye That Christopher White hath tane ffrom mee. 24 ‘But one thing I must needs confesse, This lady shee did say to me, If shee were ffalse to Christopher White, Shee cold neuer be true to mee. 25 ‘All young men a warning take, A warning, looke, you take by mee; Looke that you loue your old loues best, For infaith they are best companye.’ 109 TOM POTTS Thomas of Potte TOM POTTS—A Percy MS., p. 409; Hales and Furnivall, III, 135. 1 All you lords of Scottland ffaire, And ladyes alsoe, bright of blee, There is a ladye amongst them all, Of her report you shall heare of me. 2 Of her bewtye shee is soe bright, And of her colour soe bright of blee; Shee is daughter to the Lord Arrndell, His heyre apparrant ffor to bee. 3 ‘I'le see that bryde,’ Lord Phenix sayes, ‘That is a ladye of hye degree, And iff I like her countenance well, The heyre of all my land shee'st bee.’ 4 To that ladye ffayre Lord Phenix came, And to that like-some dame said hee, Now God thee saue, my ladye ffaire, The heyre of all my land tho'st bee. 5 ‘Leaue of your suite,’ the ladye sayd; ‘You are a lord of honor ffree; You may gett ladyes enowe att home, And I haue a loue in mine owne countrye. 6 ‘I haue a louer true of mine owne, A servinge-man of a small degree; Thomas a Pott, itt is his name, He is the ffirst loue that euer I had, and the last that hee shalbee.’ 7 ‘Giue Thomas a Pott then be his name, I wott I ken him soe readilye; I can spend forty pounds by weeke, And hee cannott spend pounds three.’ 8 ‘God giue you good of your gold,’ said the ladye, ‘And alsoe, sir, of your ffee! Hee was the ffirst loue that euer I had, And the last, sir, shall hee bee.’ 9 With that Lord Phenix was sore amoued; Vnto her ffather then went hee; Hee told her ffather how itt was proued, How that his daughter's mind was sett. 10 ‘Thou art my daughter,’ the Erle of Arrndell said, ‘The heyre of all my land to bee; Thou'st be bryde to the Lord Phenix, Daughter, giue thou'le be heyre to mee.’ 11 For lacke of her loue this ladye must lose, Her foolish wooing lay all aside; The day is appoynted, and ffreinds are agreede; Shee is fforcte to be the Lord Phenix bryde. 12 With that the lady began to muse — A greeued woman, God wott, was shee — How shee might Lord Phenix beguile, And scape vnmarryed ffrom him that day. 13 Shee called to her her litle ffoote-page, To Iacke her boy, soe tenderlye; Sayes, Come thou hither, thou litle ffoote-page, For indeed I dare trust none but thee. 14 To Strawberry Castle, boy, thou must goe, To Thomas Pott there as hee can bee, And giue him here this letter ffaire, And on Guilford Greene bidd him meete me. 15 Looke thou marke his contenance well, And his colour tell to mee; And hye thee ffast, and come againe, And forty shillings I will giue thee. 16 For if he blush in his fface, Then in his hart hee'se sorry bee; Then lett my ffather say what hee will, For false to Potts I'le neuer bee. 17 And giue hee smile then with his mouth, Then in his heart hee'le merry be; Then may hee gett him a loue where-euer he can, For small of his companye my part shalbe. 18 Then one while that the boy hee went, Another while, God wott, rann hee, And when hee came to Strawberry Castle, There Thomas Potts hee see. 19 Then he gaue him this letter ffaire, And when he began then for to reade, They boy had told him by word of mouth His loue must be the Lord Phenix bryde. 20 With that, Thomas a Pott began to blushe, The teares trickeled in his eye: ‘Indeed this letter I cannot reede, Nor neuer a word to see or spye. 21 ‘I pray thee, boy, to me thou'le be trew, And heer's fiue marke I will giue thee; And all these words thou must peruse, And tell thy lady this ffrom mee. 22 ‘Tell her by ffaith and troth shee is mine owne, By some part of promise, and soe itt's be found; Lord Phenix shall neuer marry her, by night nor day, Without he can winn her with his hand. 23 ‘On Gilford Greene I will her meete, And bidd that ladye ffor mee pray; For there I'le loose my liffe soe sweete, Or else the wedding I will stay.’ 24 Then backe againe the boy he went, As ffast againe as he cold hye; The ladye mett him fiue mile on the way: ‘Why hast thou stayd soe long?’ saies shee. 25 ‘Boy,’ said the ladye, ‘thou art but younge; To please my mind thou'le mocke and scorne; I will not beleeue thee on word of mouth, Vnlesse on this booke thou wilt be sworne.’ 26 ‘Marry, by this booke,’ the boy can say, ‘As Christ himselfe be true to mee, Thomas Pott cold not his letter reade For teares trickling in his eye.’ 27 ‘If this be true,’ the ladye sayd, ‘Thou bonny boy, thou tells to mee, Forty shillings I did thee promise, But heere's ten pounds I'le giue itt thee. 28 ‘All my maids,’ the lady sayd, ‘That this day doe waite on mee, Wee will ffall downe vpon our knees, For Thomas Pott now pray will wee. 29 ‘If his ffortune be now ffor to winn — Wee will pray to Christ in Trinytye — I'le make him the fflower of all his kinn, Ffor they Lord of Arrundale he shalbe.’ 30 Now lett vs leaue talking of this ladye faire, In her prayer good where shee can bee; And I'le tell you hou Thomas Pott For ayd to his lord and master came hee. 31 And when hee came Lord Iockye before, He kneeled him low downe on his knee; Saies, Thou art welcome, Thomas Pott, Thou art allwayes full of thy curtesye. 32 Has thou slaine any of thy ffellowes, Or hast thou wrought me some villanye? ‘Sir, none of my ffellowes I haue slaine, Nor I haue wrought you noe villanye. 33 ‘But I haue a loue in Scottland ffaire, I doubt I must lose her through pouertye; If you will not beleeue me by word of mouth, Behold the letter shee writt vnto mee.’ 34 When Lord Iockye looked the letter vpon, The tender words in itt cold bee, ‘Thomas Pott, take thou no care, Thou'st neuer loose her throughe pouertye. 35 ‘Thou shalt have forty pounds a weeke, In gold and siluer thou shalt rowe, And Harbye towne I will thee allowe As longe as thou dost meane to wooe. 36 ‘Thou shalt haue fortye of thy ffellowes ffaire, And forty horsse to goe with thee, And forty speares of the best I haue, And I my-selfe in thy companye.’ 37 ‘I thanke you, master,’ sayd Thomas Pott, ‘Neither man nor boy shall goe with mee; I wold not ffor a thousand pounds Take one man in my companye.’ 38 ‘Why then, God be with thee, Thomas Pott! Thou art well knowen and proued for a man; Looke thou shedd no guiltlesse bloode, Nor neuer confound no gentlman. 39 ‘But looke thou take with him some truce, Apoint a place of lybertye; Lett him provide as well as hee cann, And as well provided thou shalt bee.’ 40 And when Thomas Pott came to Gilford Greene, And walked there a litle beside, Then was hee ware of the Lord Phenix, And with him Ladye Rozamund his bryde. 41 Away by the bryde rode Thomas of Pott, But noe word to her that he did say; But when he came Lord Phenix before, He gaue him the right time of the day. 42 ‘O thou art welcome, Thomas a Potts, Thou serving-man, welcome to mee! How ffares they lord and master att home, And all the ladyes in thy cuntrye?’ 43 ‘Sir, my lord and my master is in verry good health, I wott I ken itt soe readylye; I pray you, will you ryde to one outsyde, A word or towe to talke with mee. 44 ‘You are a nobleman,’ sayd Thomas a Potts, ‘Yee are a borne lord in Scottland ffree; You may gett ladyes enowe att home; You shall neuer take my loue ffrom mee.’ 45 ‘Away, away, thou Thomas a Potts! Thou seruing-man, stand thou a-side! I wott there's not a serving-man this day, I know, can hinder mee of my bryde.’ 46 ‘If I be but a seruing-man,’ sayd Thomas, ‘And you are a lord of honor ffree, A speare or two I'le with you runn, Before I'le loose her thus cowardlye.’ 47 ‘On Gilford Greene,’ Lord Phenix saies, ‘I'le thee meete; Neither man nor boy shall come hither with mee;’ ‘And as I am a man,’ said Thomas a Pott, ‘I'le haue as ffew in my companye.’ 48 With that the wedding-day was stayd, The bryde went vnmarryed home againe; Then to her maydens ffast shee loughe, And in her hart shee was ffull ffaine. 49 ‘But all my mayds,’ they ladye sayd, ‘That this day doe waite on mee, Wee will ffall downe againe vpon our knees, For Thomas a Potts now pray will wee. 50 ‘If his ffortune be ffor to winn — Wee'le pray to Christ in Trynitye — I'le make him the fflower of all his kinn, For the Lord of Arrundale he shalbe.’ 51 Now let vs leaue talking of this lady fayre, In her prayers good where shee can bee; I'le tell you the troth how Thomas a Potts For aide to his lord againe came hee. 52 And when he came to Strawberry Castle, To try ffor his ladye he had but one weeke; Alacke, ffor sorrow hee cannott fforbeare, For four dayes then he ffell sicke. 53 With that his lord and master to him came, Sayes, I pray thee, Thomas, tell mee without all doubt, Whether hast thou gotten the bonny ladye, Or thou man gange the ladye withoute. 54 ‘Marry, master, yett that matter is vntryde; Within two dayes tryed itt must bee; He is a lord, and I am but a seruing-man, I doubt I must loose her through pouertye.’ ‘Why, Thomas a Pott, take thou no care; Thou'st neuer loose her through pouertye. 55 ‘Thou shalt haue halfe my land a yeere, And that will raise thee many a pound; Before thou shalt loose thy bonny ladye, Thou shalt drop angells with him to the ground. 56 ‘And thou shalt haue forty of thy ffellowes ffaire, And forty horsses to goe with thee, And forty speres of the best I haue, And I my-selfe in thy companye.’ 57 ‘I thanke you, master,’ sayd Thomas a Potts, ‘But of one thinge, sir, I wold be ffaine; If I shold loose my bonny ladye, How shall I increase your goods againe?’ 58 ‘Why, if thou winn thy lady ffaire, Thou maye well fforth for to pay mee; If thou loose thy lady, thou hast losse enoughe; Not one penny I will aske thee.’ 59 ‘Master, you haue thirty horsses in one hold, You keepe them ranke and royallye; There's an old horsse, — for him you doe not care — This day wold sett my lady ffree. 60 ‘That is a white, with a cutt tayle, Ffull sixteen yeeres of age is hee; Giffe you wold lend me that old horsse, Then I shold gett her easilye.’ 61 ‘Thou takes a ffoolish part,’ the Lord Iockye sayd, ‘And a ffoolish part thou takes on thee; Thou shalt haue a better then euer he was, That forty pounds cost more nor hee.’ 62 ‘O master, those horsses beene wild and wicked, And litle they can skill of the old traine; Giffe I be out of my saddle cast, They beene soe wild they'le neuer be tane againe. 63 ‘Lett me haue age, sober and wise; Itt is a part of wisdome, you know itt plaine; If I be out of my sadle cast, Hee'le either stand still or turne againe.’ 64 ‘Thou shalt haue that horsse with all my hart, And my cote-plate of siluer ffree, And a hundred men att thy backe, For to fight if neede shalbee.’ 65 ‘I thanke you, master,’ said Thomas a Potts, ‘Neither man nor boy shall goe with mee; As you are a lord off honor borne, Let none of my ffellowes know this of mee. 66 ‘Ffor if they wott of my goinge, I wott behind me they will not bee; Without you keepe them vnder a locke, Vppon that greene I shall them see.’ 67 And when Thomas came to Gilford Greene, And walked there some houres three, Then was he ware of the Lord Phenix, And four men in his companye. 68 ‘You haue broken your vow,’ sayd Thomas a Pott, ‘Your vowe that you made vnto mee; You said you wold come your selfe alone, And you haue brought more then two or three.’ 69 ‘These are my waiting-men,’ Lord Phenix sayd, ‘That euery day doe waite on mee; Giffe any of these shold att vs stirr, My speare shold runn throwe his bodye.’ 70 ‘I'le runn noe race,’ said Thomas Potts, ‘Till that this othe heere made may bee: If the one of vs be slaine, The other fforgiuen that hee may bee.’ 71 ‘I'le make a vow,’ Lord Phenix sayes, ‘My men shall beare wittnesse with thee, Giffe thou slay mee att this time, Neuer the worsse beloued in Scottland thou shalt bee.’ 72 Then they turned their horsses round about, To run the race more egarlye; Lord Phenix he was stiffe and stout, He has runn Thomas quite thorrow the thye. 73 And beere Thomas out of his saddle ffaire; Vpon the ground there did hee lye; He saies, For my liffe I doe not care, But ffor the loue of my ladye. 74 But shall I lose my ladye ffaire? I thought shee shold haue beene my wiffe; I pray thee, Lord Phenix, ryde not away, For with thee I will loose my liffe. 75 Tho Thomas a Potts was a seruing-man, He was alsoe a phisityan good; He clapt his hand vpon his wound, With some kind of words he stauncht the blood. 76 Then into his sadle againe hee leepe; The blood in his body began to warme; He mist Lord Phenix bodye there, But he run him quite throw the brawne of the arme. 77 And he bore him quite out of his saddle ffaire; Vpon the ground there did he lye; He said, I pray thee, Lord Phenix, rise and ffight, Or else yeeld this ladye sweete to mee. 78 ‘To ffight with thee,’ quoth Phenix, ‘I cannott stand, Nor ffor to ffight, I cannott, sure; Thou hast run me through the brawne of the arme; Noe longer of thy spere I cannott endure. 79 ‘Thou'st haue that ladye with all my hart, Sith itt was like neuer better to proue. Nor neuer a noble-man this day, That will seeke to take a pore man's loue.’ 80 ‘Why then, be of good cheere,’ saies Thomas Pott, ‘Indeed your bucher I'le neuer bee, For I'le come and stanche your bloode, Giff any thankes you'le giue to mee.’ 81 As he was stanching the Phenix blood, These words Thomas a Pott cann to him proue: ‘I'le neuer take a ladye of you thus, But here I'le giue you another choice. 82 ‘Heere is a lane of two miles longe; Att either end sett wee will bee; The ladye shall sitt vs betweene, And soe will wee sett this ladye ffree.’ 83 ‘If thou'le doe soe,’ Lord Phenix sayes, ‘Thomas a Pott, as thou dost tell mee, Whether I gett her or goe without her, Heere's forty pounds I'le giue itt thee.’ 84 And when the ladye there can stand, A woman's mind that day to proue, ‘Now, by my ffaith,’ said this ladye ffaire, ‘This day Thomas a Pott shall haue his owne loue.’ 85 Toward Thomas a Pott the lady shee went, To leape behind him hastilye; ‘Nay, abyde a while,’ sayd Lord Phenix, ‘Ffor better yett proued thou shalt bee. 86 ‘Thou shalt stay heere with all thy maids — In number with thee thou hast but three — Thomas a Pott and I'le goe beyond yonder wall, There the one of vs shall dye.’ 87 And when they came beyond the wall, The one wold not the other nye; Lord Phenix he had giuen his word With Thomas a Pott neuer to ffight. 88 ‘Giue me a choice,’ Lord Phenix sayes, ‘Thomas a Pott, I doe pray thee; Lett mee goe to yonder ladye ffaire, To see whether shee be true to thee.’ 89 And when hee came that ladye too, Vnto that likesome dame sayd hee, Now God thee saue, thou ladye ffaire, The heyre of all my land thou'st bee. 90 Ffor this Thomas a Potts I haue slaine; He hath more then deadlye wounds two or three; Thou art mine owne ladye, he sayd, And marryed together wee will bee. 91 The ladye said, If Thomas a Potts this day thou haue slaine, Thou hast slaine a better man than euer was thee; And I'le sell all the state of my lande But thou'st be hanged on a gallow-tree. 92 With that they lady shee ffell in a soone; A greeued woman, I wott, was shee; Lord Phenix hee was readye there, Tooke her in his armes most hastilye. 93 ‘O Lord, sweete, and stand on thy ffeete, This day Thomas a Pott aliue can bee; I'le send ffor thy father, the Lord of Arrundale, And marryed together I will you see: Giffe hee will not maintaine you well, Both gold and land you shall haue from me.’ 94 ‘I'le see that wedding,’ my Lord of Arrundale said, ‘Of my daughter's loue that is soe ffaire; And sith itt will no better be, Of all my land Thomas a Pott shall be my heyre.’ 95 ‘Now all my maids,’ the ladye said, ‘And ladyes of England, faire and ffree, Looke you neuer change your old loue for no new, Nor neuer change for no pouertye. 96 ‘Ffor I had a louer true of mine owne, A seruing-man of a small degree; Ffrom Thomas a Pott I'le turne his name, And the Lord of Arrundale hee shall bee.’ The Lovers Quarrel, or, Cupid's Triumph TOM POTTS—B a.

Pepys Penny Merriments, I, 189, Magdalen College Library, Cambridge. 1 Of all the lords in Scotland fair, And ladies that been so bright of blee, There is a noble lady among them all, And report of her you shall hear by me. 2 For of her beauty she is bright, And of her colour very fair; She's daughter to Lord Arundel, Approvd his parand and his heir. 3 ‘I'le see this bride,’ Lord Phenix said, ‘That lady of so bright a blee, And if I like her countenance well, The heir of all my lands she'st be.’ 4 But when he came the lady before, Before this comely maid came he, ‘O God thee save, thou lady sweet, My heir and parand thou shalt be.’ 5 ‘Leave off your suit,’ the lady said, ‘As you are a lord of high degree; You may have ladies enough at home, And I have a lord in mine own country. 6 ‘For I have a lover true of mine own, A serving-man of low degree, One Tommy Pots it is his name, My first love and last that ever shall be.’ 7 ‘If that Tom Pots is his name, I do ken him right verily; I am able to spend fourty pounds a week, Where he is not able to spend pounds three.’ 8 ‘God give you good of your gold,’ she said, ‘And ever God give you good of your fee; Tom Pots was the first love that ever I had, And I do mean him the last to be.’ 9 With that Lord Phenix soon was movd; Towards the lady did he threat; He told her father, and so it was provd, How his daughter's mind was set. 10 ‘O daughter dear, thou art my own, The heir of all my lands to be; Thou shalt be bride to the Lord Phenix, If that thou mean to be heir to me.’ 11 ‘O father dear, I am your own, And at your command I needs must be; But bind my body to whom you please, My heart, Tom Pots, shall go with thee.’ 12 Alas! the lady her fondness must leave, And all her foolish wooing lay aside; The time is come, her friends have appointed, That she must be Lord Phenix bride. 13 With that the lady began to weep; She knew not well then what to say, How she might Lord Phenix deny, And escape from marriage quite away. 14 See calld unto her little foot-page, Saying, I can trust none but thee; Go carry Tom Pots this letter fair, And bid him on Guilford Green meet me. 15 For I must marry against my mind, Or in faith well proved it shall be; And tell to him I am loving and kind, And wishes him this wedding to see. 16 But see that thou note his countenance well, And his colour, and shew it to me; And go thy way and hie thee again, And forty shillings I will give thee. 17 For if he smile now with his lips, His stomach will give him to laugh at the heart; Then may I seek another true-love, For of Tom Pots small is my part. 18 But if he blush now in his face, Then in his heart he will sorry be; Then to his vow he hath some grace, And false to him I will never be. 19 Away this lacky-boy he ran, And a full speed forsooth went he, Till he came to Strawberry Castle, And there Tom Pots came he to see. 20 He gave him the letter in his hand; Before that he began to read, He told him plainly by word of mouth, His love was forc'd to be Lord Phenix bride. 21 When he lookd on the letter fair, The salt tears blemished his eye; Says, I cannot read this letter fair, Nor never a word to see or spy. 22 My little boy, be to me true, Here is five marks I will give thee; And all these words I must peruse, And tell my lady this from me. 23 By faith and troth she is my own, By some part of promise, so it's to be found; Lord Phoenix shall not have her night nor day, Except he can win her with his own hand. 24 On Guilford Green I will her meet; Say that I wish her for me to pray; For there I'le lose my life so sweet, Or else the wedding I mean to stay. 25 Away this lackey-boy he ran, Even as fast as he could hie; The lady she met him two miles of the way; Says, Why hast thou staid so long, my boy? 26 My little boy, thou art but young, It gives me at heart thou'l mock and scorn; I'le not believe thee by word of mouth, Unless on this book thou wilt be sworn. 27 ‘Now by this book,’ the boy did say, ‘And Jesus Christ be as true to me, Tom Pots could not read the letter fair, Nor never a word to spy or see. 28 ‘He says, by faith and troth you are his own, By some part of promise, so it's to be found; Lord Phenix shall not have you night nor day, Except he win you with his own hand. 29 ‘On Guilford Green he will you meet; He wishes you for him to pray; For there he'l lose his life so sweet, Or else the wedding he means to stay.’ 30 ‘If this be true, my little boy, These tidings which thou tellest to me, Forty shillings I did thee promise, Here is ten pounds I will give thee. 31 ‘My maidens all,’ the lady said, ‘That ever wish me well to prove, Now let us all kneel down and pray That Tommy Pots may win his love. 32 ‘If it be his fortune the better to win, As I pray to Christ in Trinity, I'le make him the flower of all his kin, For the young Lord Arundel he shall be.’ 33 Let's leave talking of this lady fair, In prayers full good where she may be; Now let us talk of Tommy Pots; To his lord and master for aid went he. 34 But when he came Lord Jockey before, He kneeled lowly on his knee: ‘What news, what news, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art so full of courtesie? 35 ‘What tydings, what tydings, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art so full of courtesie? Thou hast slain some of thy fellows fair, Or wrought to me some villany.’ 36 ‘I have slain none of my fellows fair, Nor wrought to you no villany, But I have a love in Scotland fair, And I fear I shall lose her with poverty. 37 ‘If you'l not believe me by word of mouth, But read this letter, and you shall see, Here by all these suspitious words That she her own self hath sent to me.’ 38 But when he had read the letter fair, Of all the suspitious words in it might be, ‘O Tommy Pots, take thou no care, Thou'st never lose her with poverty. 39 ‘For thou'st have forty pounds a week, In gold and silver thou shalt row, And Harvy Town I will give thee As long as thou intendst to wooe. 40 ‘Thou'st have forty of thy fellows fair, And forty horses to go with thee, Forty of the best spears I have, And I my self in thy company.’ 41 ‘I thank you, master,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘That proffer is too good for me; But, if Jesus Christ stand on my side, My own hands shall set her free. 42 ‘God be with you, master,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘Now Jesus Christ you save and see; If ever I come alive again, Staid the wedding it shall be.’ 43 ‘O God be your speed, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art well proved for a man; See never a drop of blood thou spil, Nor yonder gentleman confound. 44 ‘See that some truce with him you take, And appoint a place of liberty; Let him provide him as well as he can, As well provided thou shalt be.’ 45 But when he came to Guilford Green, And there had walkt a little aside, There was he ware of Lord Phenix come, And Lady Rosamond his bride. 46 Away by the bride then Tommy Pots went, But never a word to her did say, Till he the Lord Phenix came before; He gave him the right time of the day. 47 ‘O welcome, welcome, thou Tommy Pots, Thou serving-man of low degree; How doth thy lord and master at home, And all the ladies in that countrey?’ 48 ‘My lord and master is in good health, I trust since that I did him see; Will you walk with me to an out-side, Two or three words to talk with me? 49 ‘You are a noble man,’ said Tom, ‘And born a lord in Scotland free; You may have ladies enough at home, And never take my love from me.’ 50 ‘Away, away, thou Tommy Pots; Thou serving-man, stand thou aside; It is not a serving-man this day That can hinder me of my bride.’ 51 ‘If I be a serving-man,’ said Tom, ‘And you a lord of high degree, A spear or two with you I'le run, Before I'le lose her cowardly. 52 ‘Appoint a place, I will thee meet, Appoint a place of liberty; For there I'le lose my life so sweet, Or else my lady I'le set free.’ 53 ‘On Guilford Green I will thee meet; No man nor boy shall come with me:’ ‘As I am a man,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘I'le have as few in my company.’ 54 And thus staid the marriage was, The bride unmarried went home again; Then to her maids fast did she laugh, And in her heart she was full fain. 55 ‘My maidens all,’ the lady said, ‘That ever wait on me this day, Now let us all kneel down, And for Tommy Pots let us all pray. 56 ‘If it be his fortune the better to win, As I trust to God in Trinity, I'le make him the flower of all his kin, For the young Lord Arundel he shall be.’ 57 When Tom Pots came home again, To try for his love he had but a week; For sorrow, God wot, he need not care, For four days that he fel sick. 58 With that his master to him came, Says, Pray thee, Tom Pots, tell me if tho doubt Whether thou hast gotten thy gay lady, Or thou must go thy love without. 59 ‘O master, yet it is unknown; Within these two days well try'd it must be; He is a lord, I am but a serving-man, I fear I shall lose her with poverty.’ 60 ‘I prethee, Tom Pots, get thee on thy feet; My former promises kept shall be; As I am a lord in Scotland fair, Thou'st never lose her with poverty. 61 ‘For thou'st have the half of my lands a year, And that will raise thee many a pound; Before thou shalt out-braved be, Thou shalt drop angels with him on the ground.’ 62 ‘I thank you, master,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘Yet there is one thing of you I would fain; If that I lose my lady sweet, How I'st restore your goods again?’ 63 ‘If that thou win the lady sweet, Thou mayst well forth, thou shalt pay me; If thou loosest thy lady, thou losest enough; Thou shalt not pay me one penny.’ 64 ‘You have thirty horses in one close, You keep them all both frank and free; Amongst them all there's an old white horse This day would set my lady free. 65 ‘That is an old horse with a cut tail, Full sixteen years of age is he; If thou wilt lend me that old horse, Then could I win her easily.’ 66 ‘That's a foolish opinion,’ his master said, ‘And a foolish opinion thou tak'st to thee; Thou'st have a better then ever he was, Though forty pounds more it cost me.’ 67 ‘O your choice horses are wild and tough, And little they can skill of their train; If I be out of my saddle cast, They are so wild they'l ner be tain.’ 68 ‘Thou'st have that horse,’ his master said, ‘If that one thing thou wilt tell me; Why that horse is better than any other, I pray thee, Tom Pots, shew thou to me.’ 69 ‘That horse is old, of stomach bold, And well can he skill of his train; If I be out of my saddle cast, He'l either stand still or turn again.’ 70 ‘Thou'st have the horse with all my heart, And my plate-coat of silver free; An hundred men to stand at thy back, To fight if he thy master be.’ 71 ‘I thank you master,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘That proffer is too good for me; I would not, for ten thousand pounds, Have man or boy in my company. 72 ‘God be with you, master,’ said Tommy Pots; ‘Now, as you are a man of law, One thing let me crave at your hand; Let never a one of my fellows know. 73 ‘For if that my fellows they did wot, Or ken of my extremity, Except you keep them under a lock, Behind me I am sure they would not be.’ 74 But when he came to Guilford Green, He waited hours two or three; There he was ware of Lord Phenix come, And four men in his company. 75 ‘You have broken your vow,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘The vow which you did make to me; You said you would bring neither man nor boy, And now has brought more than two or three.’ 76 ‘These are my men,’ Lord Phenix said, ‘Which every day do wait on me; [If] any of these dare proffer to strike, I'le run my spear through his body.’ 77 ‘I'le run no race now,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘Except now this may be; If either of us be slain this day, The other shall forgiven be.’ 78 ‘I'le make that vow with all my heart, My men shall bear witness with me; And if thou slay me here this day, In Scotland worse belovd thou never shalt be.’ 79 They turnd their horses thrice about, To run the race so eagerly; Lord Phenix he was fierce and stout, And ran Tom Pots through the thick o th' thigh. 80 He bord him out of the saddle fair, Down to the ground so sorrowfully: ‘For the loss of my life I do not care, But for the loss of my fair lady. 81 ‘Now for the loss of my lady sweet, Which once I thought to have been my wife, I pray thee, Lord Phenix, ride not away, For with thee I would end my life.’ 82 Tom Pots was but a serving-man, But yet he was a doctor good; He bound his handkerchief on his wound, And with some kind of words he stancht his blood. 83 He leapt into his saddle again, The blood in his body began to warm; He mist Lord Phenix body fair, And ran him through the brawn of the arm. 84 He bord him out of his saddle fair, Down to the ground most sorrowfully; Says, Prethee, Lord Phenix, rise up and fight, Or yield my lady unto me. 85 ‘Now for to fight I cannot tell, And for to fight I am not sure; Thou hast run me throw the brawn o th' arm, That with a spear I may not endure. 86 ‘Thou'st have the lady with all my heart; It was never likely better to prove With me, or any nobleman else, That would hinder a poor man of his love.’ 87 ‘Seeing you say so much,’ said Tommy Pots, ‘I will not seem your butcher to be; But I will come and stanch your blood, If any thing you will give me.’ 88 As he did stanch Lord Phenix blood, Lord, in his heart he did rejoyce! ‘I'le not take the lady from you thus, But of her you'st have another choice. 89 ‘Here is a lane of two miles long; At either end we set will be; The lady shall stand us among, Her own choice shall set her free.’ 90 ‘If thou'l do so,’ Lord Phenix said, ‘To lose her by her own choice it's honesty; Chuse whether I get her or go her without, Forty pounds I will give thee.’ 91 But when they in that lane was set, The wit of a woman for to prove, ‘By the faith of my body,’ the lady said, ‘Then Tom Pots must needs have his love.’ 92 Towards Tom Pots the lady did hie, To get on behind him hastily; ‘Nay stay, nay stay,’ Lord Phenix said, ‘Better proved it shall be. 93 ‘Stay you with your maidens here — In number fair they are but three — Tom Pots and I will go behind yonder wall, That one of us two be proved to dye.’ 94 But when they came behind the wall, The one came not the other nigh; For the Lord Phenix had made a vow, That with Tom Pots he would never fight. 95 ‘O give me this choice,’ Lord Phenix said, ‘To prove whether true or false she be, And I will go to the lady fair, And tell her Tom Pots slain is he.’ 96 When he came from behind the wall, With his face all bloody as it might be, ‘O lady sweet, thou art my own, For Tom Pots slain have I. 97 ‘Now have I slain him, Tommy Pots, And given him death's wounds two or three; O lady sweet, thou art my own; Of all loves, wilt thou live with me?’ 98 ‘If thou hast slain him, Tommy Pots, And given him death's wounds two or three, I'le sell the state of my father's lands But hanged shall Lord Phenix be.’ 99 With that the lady fell in a swound, For a grieved woman, God wot, was she; Lord Phenix he was ready then To take her up so hastily. 100 ‘O lady sweet, stand thou on thy feet, Tom Pots alive this day may be; I'le send for thy father, Lord Arundel, And he and I the wedding will see. 101 ‘I'le send for thy father, Lord Arundel, And he and I the wedding will see; If he will not maintain you well, Both lands and livings you'st have of me.’ 102 ‘I'le see this wedding,’ Lord Arundel said, ‘Of my daughter's luck that is so fair; Seeing the matter will be no better, Of all my lands Tom Pots shall be the heir.’ 103 With that the lady began for to smile, For a glad woman, God wot, was she; ‘Now all my maids,’ the lady said, ‘Example you may take by me. 104 ‘But all the ladies of Scotland fair, And lasses of England that well would prove, Neither marry for gold nor goods, Nor marry for nothing but only love. 105 ‘For I had a lover true of my own, A serving-man of low degree; Now from Tom Pots I'le change his name, For the young Lord Arundel he shall be.’ The Two Constant Lovers in Scotland TOM POTTS—C A white letter sheet in five columns, “published May 29, 1657,” The King's Pamphlets, British Museum, 669, f. 20, 55. 1 In Scotland there are ladies fair, There's ladies of honor and high degree, Hey down, down a down derry But one excels above all the rest, And the Earl of Arundel's daughter is she. With hey down, derry down, Lang derry down derry 2 Both knights and lords of great account Comes thither a wooing for this ladie's sake: It fell on a day that Earl Arundell said, Daughter, which of these lords will you take? 3 Or which of them now likes thee best? Speak truth to me, but do not lie; Speak truth to me, and do not jest, Who must heir my livings when as I die? 4 Lord Fenix is a lord of high degree, And hath both lands and livings free; I tell thee, daughter, thou shalt him have, If thou wilt take any counsell at me. 5 With that the young lady fell down of her knee, And trickling tears ran down her eye: ‘As you are my father, and loves me dear, My heart is set where it must be. 6 ‘On a serving-man which is so poor, For all he hath is but pounds three; He was the first lover that ere I had, And the last I mean him for to be.’ 7 With that her father was sore offended, And fast he rode at that same tide, Untill he to the Lord Fenix came, And said, Take thee my daughter for thy bride. 8 The yong ladie cald up Jack, her foot-boy: ‘I dare trust no man alive but thee; Thou must go my earand to Strawbery Castle, To the place where Tomy o'th Potts doth lye. 9 ‘And carry this letter, in parchment fair, That I have sealed with mine own hand; And when Tomey looks this letter upon, Be sure his countenance thou understand. 10 ‘And if he either laugh or smile, He is not sorry at his heart; I must seek a new love where I will, For small of Tomey must be my part. 11 ‘But if he wax red in the face, And tricling tears fall from his eyes, Then let my father say what he will, For true to Tomey I'le be always. 12 ‘And thou must tell him by word of mouth, If this letter cannot be read at that tyde, That this day sennight, and no longer hence, I must be Lord William Fenix bride.’ 13 The boy took leave of his lady gay, And to Strawbery Castle he did him fast hie; A serving-man did guide him the way To the place where Tomey o'th Pots did lie. 14 ‘O Christ thee save, good Tomey o'th Pots, And Christ thee save as I thee see; Come read this letter, Tomey o'th Potts, As thy true-love hath sent to thee.’ 15 Then Tomey he waxed red in the face, And trickling tears ran down his eyes; But never a letter could he read, If he should be hanged on th' gallow-tree. 16 ‘Shee bid me tell you by word of mouth, If this letter could not be read at this tide, That this day sennight, and no longer hence, She must be Lord William Fenix bride.’ 17 ‘Now in faith,’ said Tomey, ‘she is mine own, As all hereafter shall understand; Lord Fenix shall not marry her, by night or day, Unless he win her by his own hand. 18 ‘For on Gilforth Green I will her meet, And if she love me, bid her for me pray; And there I will lose my life so sweet, Or else her wedding I will stay.’ 19 He cald this boy unto accounts; Think whether he loved this lady gay! He gave him forty shilling for his message, And all he had was but pounds three. 20 The boy took his leave of Tomey o'th Potts, Fearing that he had staid too late; The young lady did wait of his comming, And met him five miles out of the gate. 21 ‘O honey boy, thou art not of age, Therefore thou canst both mock and scorn; I will not beleeve what my love hath said, Unlesse thou on this book be sworn.’ 22 ‘Now, in faith, gay lady, I will not lye,’ And kist the book full soon did he: ‘One letter he could not read at that time, If he should have been hangd at gallo-tree. 23 ‘He said in faith you are his own, As all hereafter shall understand; Lord Fenix shall not marry you by night or day, Unlesse he winn you with his own hand. 24 ‘For on Gilforth Green he will you meet, And if you love him, you must for him pray; And there he will lose his life so sweet, Or else your wedding he will stay.’ 25 Let us leave talking of the boy, That with his gay lady is turned home; Now let us go talk of Tomey o'th Potts, And how to his master he is gone. 26 When Tomey came his master before, He kneeled down upon his knee: ‘What tidings hast thou brought, my man, As that thou makes such courtesie?’ 27 ‘O Christ you save, dear master,’ he said, ‘And Christ you save as I you see; For God's love, master, come read me this letter, Which my true love hath sent to me.’ 28 His master took this letter in hand, And looked ore it with his eye; ‘In faith, I am fain, my man,’ he said, ‘As thou hast a lady so true to thee.’ 29 ‘I have a lady true to me, And false to her I'le never be; But ere this day sennight, and no longer hence, I must lose my love through povertie. 30 ‘Lord Fenix he will her have, Because he hath more wealth then I:’ ‘Now hold thy tongue, my man,’ he said, ‘For before that day many a one shall die. 31 ‘O Tomey,’ said he, ‘I love thee well, And something for thee I will doo; For Strawbery Castle shall be thine own So long as thou dost mean to woo. 32 ‘One half of my lands I'le give thee a year, The which will raise thee many a pound; Before that thou lose thy bonny sweet-hart, Thou shalt drop angels with him to the ground. 33 ‘I have thirty steeds in my stable strong, Which any of them is good indeed, And a bunch of spears hangs them among, And a nag to carry thee swift with speed. 34 ‘My sute of armour thou shalt put on — So well it becomes thy fair body — And when thou comst on Gilford Green Thou'll look more like a lord then he. 35 ‘My men shall all rise and with thee go, And I my self with thee will ride; And many a bloody wound will we make Before that thou shalt lose thy bride.’ 36 ‘Now Christ reward you, dear master,’ he said, ‘For the good will you bear to me; But I trust to God, in a little space, With my own hands to set her free. 37 ‘I'le none of your horses, master,’ he said, ‘For they cannot well skill of their trade; None but your gray nag that hath a cut tail, For hee'll either stand or turn again. 38 ‘One spear, master, and no more, No more with me that I will take, And if that spear it will not serve my turn, I'le suffer death for my true-love's sake.’ 39 Early in the morning, when day did spring, On Gilforth Green betime was he; There did he espie Lord Fenix comming, And with him a royall company. 40 Gold chains about their necks threescore, Full well might seem fine lords to ride; The young lady followed far behind, Sore against her will that she was a bride. 41 There Tomey passed this lady by, But never a word to her did say; Then straight to Lord Fenix he is gone, And gives him the right time of the day. 42 ‘O Christ you save, Lord Fenix,’ he said, ‘And Christ you save as I you see;’ ‘Thou art welcome, Tomey o'th Potts,’ he said, ‘A serving-man into our company. 43 ‘O how doth thy master, Tomy o'th Potts? Tell me the truth and do not lye;’ ‘My master is well,’ then Tomey replide, ‘I thank my lord, and I thank not thee. 44 ‘O Christ you save Lord Fenix,’ he said, ‘And Christ you save as I you see; You may have choyce of ladies enough, And not take my true-love from me.’ 45 With that Lord Fenix was sore offended, And fast away he rode at that tide; ‘God forbid,’ Lord Fenix he said, ‘A serving-man should hold me from my bride!’ 46 But afterward Tomey did him meet, As one that came not thither to flye, And said, Lord Fenix, take thou my love, For I will not lose her cowardly. 47 ‘O meet me here tomorrow,’ he said; ‘As thou art a man, come but thy sell; And if that I come [with] any more, The divell fetch my soul to hell.’ 48 And so this wedding-day was staid, The lady and lords they turned home; The lady made merry her maidens among, And said, Tomey I wish thou may win thy own. 49 Early in the morning, when day did spring, On Gilforth Green betime was he; He waited long for Lord Fenix comming, But Lord William Fenix he could not see. 50 He waited long and very long, Untill the sun waxed very high; There was he ware of Lord Fenix coming, And with him other men three. 51 ‘Thou art a false thief, Lord Fenix,’ he said, ‘Because thou breakst thy promise with me; Thou promisedst me to come by thy self, And thou hast brought other men three. 52 ‘But in regard I call thee thief, Because thou hast broken promise with me, I vow, and you were as many more, Forsaken sure you should not be.’ 53 ‘These are my men,’ Lord Fenix said, ‘That every day do wait on me; If any of them do strike a stroke, In faith then hanged he shall be.’ 54 They fetcht a race and rode about, And then they met full eagerly; Lord Fenix away by Tomey's body glowd, And he ran him quite thorow the thigh. 55 Out of his saddle bore him he did, And laid his body on the ground; His spear he ran thorow Tomey's thigh, In which he made a grievous wound. 56 But Tomey quickly start up again; For as he was a physitian good, He laid his hand upon the wound, And quickly he did stanch the blood. 57 Full lightly he leaped to his saddle again, Forth of it long he did not stay; For he weighed more of the ladie's love Then of any life he had that day. 58 They fetched a race and rode about, The blood in Tomey's body began to warm; He away by Lord Fenix body glowde, And he ran him quite through the arm. 59 Out of his saddle bore him he hath, Of from his steed that mounted so high; ‘Now rise and fight, Lord Fenix,’ he said, ‘Or else yeeld the lady unto me.’ 60 ‘I'll yeeld the lady unto thee; My arm no more my spear will guide; It was never better likely to prove, To hold a poor serving-man from his bride.’ 61 ‘But if thou wilt thus deal then with me, Lest of this matter should rise any voice, That I have gotten the victory, Then thou shalt have another choice. 62 ‘Yonder is a lane of two miles long; At either end then stand will we; Wee'l set the lady in the midst, And whether she come to, take her, for me.’ 63 ‘If thou wilt thus deal,’ said Fenix then, ‘Thou'll save my credit and honor high; And whether I win her, or go without her, I'le be willing to give ten pounds to thee.’ 64 There was a lane of two miles long; The lady was set in the middle that tide; She laught and made merry her maids among, And said, Tomey o'th Pots, now I'le be thy bride. 65 Now all you ladies of high degree, And maides that married yet would be, Marry no man for goods or lands, Unlesse you love him faithfully. 66 For I had a love of my own, she said, At Strawberrie Castle there lived he; I'le change his name from Tomey o'th Pots, And the yong Earl of Arundell now he shall be. 110 THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER The Beautifull Shepherdesse of Arcadia THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—A a. Roxburghe Ballads, III, 160, 161. b. The same, II, 30, 31. 1 There was a shepherd's daughter Came triping on the way, And there she met a courteous knight, Which caused her to stay. Sing trang dil do lee 2 ‘Good morow to you, beautious maid,’ These words pronounced he; ‘O I shall dye this day,’ he said, ‘If I have not my will of thee.’ 3 ‘The Lord forbid,’ the maid reply'd, ‘That such a thing should be, That ever such a courteous yong knight Should dye for love of me.’ 4 He took her by the middle so small, And laid her down on the plain, And after he had had his will, He took her up again. 5 ‘Now you have had your wil, good sir, And put my body thus to shame, Even as you are a courteous knight, Tel me what is your name.’ 6 ‘Some men do call me Jack, sweet heart, And some do call me John, But when I come to the king's [fair] court, They call me Sweet William.’ 7 He set his foot in the stirrop, And away then did he ride; She tuckt her kirtle about her middle, And run close by his side. 8 But when she came to the broad water, She set her brest and swom, And when she was got out again, She took her heels and run. 9 He never was the courteous knight To say, Fair maid, will you ride? Nor she never was so loving a maid To say, Sir Knight, abide. 10 But when she came to the king's fair court, She knocked at the ring; So ready was the king himself To let this fair maid in. 11 ‘O Christ you save, my gracious leige, Your body Christ save and see! You have got a knight within your court This day hath robbed me. 12 ‘What hath he robbed thee of, fair maid? Of purple or of pall? Or hath he took thy gay gold ring, From off thy finger small?’ 13 ‘He hath not robbed me, my liege, Of purple nor of pall; But he hath got my maidenhead, Which grieves me worst of all.’ 14 ‘Now if he be a batchelor, His body I'le give to thee; But if he be a married man, High hanged shall he be.’ 15 He called down his merry men all, By one, by two, and by three; Sweet William was us'd to be the first, But now the last comes hee. 16 He brought her down full forty pound, Ty'd up with[in] a glove: ‘Fair maid, I give the same to the, And seek another love.’ 17 ‘O I'le have none of your gold,’ she said, ‘Nor I'le have none of your fee; But I must have your fair body The king hath given me.’ 18 Sweet William ran and fetcht her then Five hundred pound in gold, Saying, Fair maid, take this unto thee; Thy fault will never be told. 19 ‘'Tis not your gold that shall me tempt,’ These words then answered she, ‘But I must have your own body; So the king hath granted me.’ 20 ‘Would I had drank the fair water When I did drink the wine, That ever any shepherd's daughter Should be a fair lady of mine! 21 ‘Would I had drunk the puddle-water When I did drink the ale, That ever any shepherd's daughter Should have told me such a tale!’ 22 ‘A shepheard's daughter as I was, You might have let me be; I'd never come to the king's fair court To have craved any love of thee.’ 23 He set her on a milk-white steed, And himselfe upon a gray; He hung a bugle about his neck, And so they rode away. 24 But when they came unto the place Where marriage rites were done, She provd her self a duke's daughter, And he but a squire's son. 25 ‘Now you have married me, sir knight, Your pleasures may be free; If you make me lady of one good town, I'le make you lord of three.’ 26 ‘Accursed be the gold,’ he said, ‘If thou hadst not bin true, That should have parted thee from me, To have chang'd thee for a new.’ 27 Their hearts being then so linked fast, And joyning hand in hand, He had both purse and person too, And all at his command. Shepherd's Dochter THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—B Kinloch MSS, V, 255, in the handwriting of Mr Kinloch. 1 There was a shepherd's dochter Kept sheep upon yon hill, And by cam a gay braw gentleman, And wad hae had his will. 2 He took her by the milk-white hand, And laid her on the ground, And whan he got his will o her He lift her up again. 3 ‘O syne ye've got your will o me, Your will o me ye've taen, 'Tis all I ask o you, kind sir, Is to tell to me your name.’ 4 ‘Sometimes they call me Jack,’ he said, ‘Sometimes they call me John, But whan I am in the king's court, My name is Wilfu Will.’ 5 Then he loup on his milk-white steed, And straught away he rade, And she did kilt her petticoats, And after him she gaed. 6 He never was sae kind as say, O lassie, will ye ride? Nor ever had she the courage to say, O laddie, will ye bide! 7 Until they cam to a wan water, Which was called Clyde, And then he turned about his horse, Said, Lassie, will ye ride? 8 ‘I learned it in my father's hall, I learned it for my weel, That whan I come to deep water, I can swim as it were an eel. 9 ‘I learned it in my mother's bower, I learned it for my better, That whan I come to broad water, I can swim like ony otter.’ 10 He plunged his steed into the ford, And straught way thro he rade, And she set in her lilly feet, And thro the water wade. 11 And whan she cam to the king's court, She tirled on the pin, And wha sae ready's the king himsel To let the fair maid in? 12 ‘What is your will wi me, fair maid? What is your will wi me?’ ‘There is a man into your court This day has robbed me.’ 13 ‘O has he taen your gold,’ he said, ‘Or has he taen your fee? Or has he stown your maidenhead, The flower of your bodye?’ 14 ‘He has na taen my gold, kind sir, Nor as little has he taen my fee, But he has taen my maidenhead, The flower of my bodye.’ 15 ‘O gif he be a married man, High hangit shall he be, But gif he be a bachelor, His body I'll grant thee.’ 16 ‘Sometimes they call him Jack,’ she said, ‘Sometimes they call him John, But whan he's in the king's court, His name is Sweet William.’ 17 ‘There's not a William in a' my court, Never a one but three, And one of them is the Queen's brother; I wad laugh gif it war he.’ 18 The king called on his merry men, By thirty and by three; Sweet Willie, wha used to be foremost man, Was the hindmost a' but three. 19 O he cam cripple, and he cam blind, Cam twa-fald oer a tree: ‘O be he cripple, or be he blind, This very same man is he.’ 20 ‘O whether will ye marry the bonny may, Or hang on the gallows-tree?’ ‘O I will rather marry the bonny may, Afore that I do die.’ 21 But he took out a purse of gold, Weel locked in a glove: ‘O tak ye that, my bonny may, And seek anither love.’ 22 ‘O I will hae none o your gold,’ she says, ‘Nor as little ony of your fee, But I will hae your ain body, The king has granted me.’ 23 O he took out a purse of gold, A purse of gold and store; ‘O tak ye that, fair may,’ he said, ‘Frae me ye'll neer get mair.’ 24 ‘O haud your tongue, young man,’ she says, ‘And I pray you let me be; For I will hae your ain body, The king has granted me.’ 25 He mounted her on a bonny bay horse, Himsel on the silver grey; He drew his bonnet out oer his een, He whipt and rade away. 26 O whan they cam to yon nettle bush, The nettles they war spread: ‘O an my mither war but here,’ she says, ‘These nettles she wad sued.’ 27 ‘O an I had drank the wan water Whan I did drink the wine, That eer a shepherd's dochter Should hae been a love o mine!’ 28 ‘O may be I'm a shepherd's dochter, And may be I am nane; But you might hae ridden on your ways, And hae let me alane.’ 29 O whan they cam unto yon mill, She heard the mill clap: 30 ‘Clap on, clap on, thou bonny mill, Weel may thou, I say, For mony a time thou's filled my pock Wi baith oat-meal and grey.’ 31 ‘O an I had drank the wan water Whan I did drink the wine, That eer a shepherd's dochter Should hae been a love o mine!’ 32 ‘O may be I'm a shepherd's dochter, And may be I am nane; But you might hae ridden on your ways, And hae let me alane. 33 ‘But yet I think a fitter match Could scarcely gang thegither Than the King of France's auld dochter And the Queen of Scotland's brither.’ Earl Richard THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—C Kinloch's MSS, VII, 69; apparently from the recitation of Mrs Charles of Torry, Aberdeen, born in Mearnshire. 1 There was a shepherd's dochter Kept sheep on yonder hill; Bye cam a knicht frae the High College, And he wad hae his will. 2 Whan he had got his wills o her, His will as he has taen: ‘Wad ye be sae gude and kind As tell to me your name?’ 3 ‘Some ca's me Jock, some ca's me John, Some disna ken my name, But whan I'm into the king's court, Mitchcock is my name.’ 4 ‘Mitchcock! hey!’ the lady did say, And spelt it oure again; ‘If that's your name in the Latin tongue, Earl Richard is your name!’ 5 O jumpt he upon his horse, And said he wad go ride; Kilted she her green claithing, And said she wad na bide. 6 The knicht rade on, the lady ran, A live-lang simmer's day, Till they cam to a wan water Was calld the river Tay. 7 ‘Jump on behind, ye weill-faurd may, Or do ye chuse to ride?’ ‘No, thank ye, sir,’ the lady said, ‘I rather chuse to wade;’ And afore that he was mid-water, She was at the ither side. 8 ‘Turn back, turn back, ye weill-faurd may, My heart will brak in three:’ ‘And sae did mine in yon bonny hill-side, Whan ye wad [na] lat me be.’ 9 ‘Whare gat ye that gay claithing This day I see on thee?’ ‘My mither was a gude milk-nurse, And a gude nourice was she; She nursd the Earl of Stockford's daughter, And gat aw this to me.’ 10 Whan she cam to the king's court, She rappit wi a ring; Sae ready as the king himsel Was to let the lady in! 11 ‘There is a knicht into your court This day has robbed me:’ ‘O has he taen your gowd,’ he says, ‘Or has he taen your fee?’ 12 ‘He has na taen my gowd,’ she says, ‘Nor yet has he my fee; But he has taen my maiden-head, The flowr o my fair bodie.’ 13 Then out bespak the queen hersel, Wha sat by the king's knee: There's na a knicht in aw our court Wad hae dune that to thee, Unless it war my brither, Earl Richard, And forbid it it war he! 14 Wad ye ken your love, Amang a hunder men? ‘I wad,’ said the bonnie ladie, ‘Amang five hunder and ten.’ 15 The king made aw his merry men pass, By ane, by twa, and three; Earl Richard us'd to be the first man, But he was hinmost man that day. 16 He cam hauping on ane foot, And winking with ae ee; But ‘Ha! ha!’ said the bonnie ladie, ‘That same young man are ye.’ 17 He's taen her up to a hie towr-head And offerd her hunder punds in a glove: ‘Gin ye be a courteous maid, Ye'll choice anither love.’ 18 ‘What care I for your hunder pund? Na mair than ye wad for mine; What's a hunder pund to me, To a marriage wi a king!’ 19 Whan the marriage it was oure, And ilk ane took them horse, ‘It never set a beggar's brat At nae knicht's back to be.’ 20 The ladie met wi a beggar-wife, And gied her half o crown: ‘Tell aw your neebours, whan ye gang hame, That Earl Richard's your gude-son.’ 21 ‘O hold your tongue, ye beggar's brat, My heart will brak in three;’ ‘And sae did mine on yon bonny hill-side, Whan ye wad na let me be.’ 22 Whan she cam to yon nettle-dyke, ‘An my auld mither she was here, Sae weill as she wad ye pu. 23 ‘She wad boil ye weill, and butter ye weill, And sup till she war fu, And lay her head upon her dish-doup, And sleep like onie sow.’ 24 Whan she cam to Earl Richard's house, The sheets war holland fine: ‘O haud awa thae linen sheets, And bring to me the linsey clouts I hae been best used in.’ 25 [‘Awa, awa wi your siller spoons, Haud them awa frae me; It would set me better to feed my flocks Wi the brose-cap on my knee: Sae bring to me the gude ram's horn, The spoons I've been used wi.’] 26 ‘Hold your tongue, ye beggar's brat, My heart will brak in three;’ ‘And sae did mine on yon bonnie hillside, Whan ye wadna lat me be.’ 27 ‘I wish I had drank the well-water Whan first I drank the wine!

Only such portions of this version were preserved as differed considerably from C. 1 And he was never sae discreet As bid her loup on and ride, And she was neer sae meanly bred As for to bid him bide. 2 And whan she cam to yon water, It was running like a flude: ‘I've learned it in my mither's bouer, I've learned it for my gude, That I can soum this wan water Like a fish in a flude. 3 ‘I've learned it in my father's bouer, I've learned it for my better, And I will soum this wan water As tho I was ane otter.’ 4 ‘Gude day, gude day, my liege the king, Gude day, gude day, to thee;’ ‘Gude day,’ quo he, ‘my lady fair, What want ye wi me?’ 5 ‘Gin he be a single man, His bodie I'll gie thee; But gin he be a married man, I'll hang him on a tree.’ 6 He's powd out a hundred punds, Weel lockit in a glove; 7 ‘I'll hae nane o your gowd,’ she said, ‘Nor either o your fee; But I will hae your ain bodie The king has granted me.’ 8 ‘O was ye gentle gotten, maid? Or was ye gentle born? Or hae ye onie gerss growing? Or hae ye onie corn? 9 ‘Or hae ye onie lands or rents, Lying at libertie? Or hae ye onie education, To dance alang wi me?’ 10 ‘I was na gentle gotten, madam, Nor was I gentle born; Neither hae I gerss growing, Nor hae I onie corn. 11 ‘I have na onie lands or rents, Lying at libertie; Nor hae I onie education, To dance alang wi thee.’ 12 He lap on ae milk-white steed, And she lap on anither, And then the twa rade out the way Like sister and like brither. 13 And whan she cam to Tyne's water, She wililie did say, Fareweil, ye mills o Tyne's water, With thee I bid gude-day. 14 Fareweil, ye mills o Tyne's water, To you I bid gud-een, Whare monie a day I hae filld my pock, Baith at midnicht and at een. 15 Whan they cam to her father's yett, She tirled on the pin; And an auld belly-blind man was sitting there, As they war entering in. 16 ‘The meetest marriage,’ the belly-blind did cry, ‘Atween the ane and the ither, Atween the Earl of Stockford's dochter And the Queen o England's brither.’ Earl Richard, the Queen's Brother THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—E a.

Motherwell's MS., p. 459, derived, no doubt, from Buchan. 1 Earl Richard, once upon a day, And all his valiant men so wight, He did him down to Barnisdale, Where all the land is fair and light. 2 He was aware of a damosel — I wot fast on she did her bound — With towers of gold upon her head, As fair a woman as could be found. 3 He said, Busk on you, fair ladye, The white flowers and the red; For I would give my bonnie ship To get your maidenhead. 4 ‘I wish your bonnie ship rent and rive, And drown you in the sea; For all this would not mend the miss That ye would do to me.’ ‘The miss is not so great, ladye; Soon mended it might be. 5 ‘I have four an twenty mills in Scotland, Stands on the water of Tay; You'll have them, and as much flour As they'll grind in a day.’ 6 ‘I wish your bonnie ship rent and rive, And drown you in the sea; For all that would not mend the miss That ye would do to me.’ ‘The miss is not so great, ladye; Soon mended it will be. 7 ‘I have four an twenty milk-white cows, All calved in a day; You'll have them, and as much haind grass As they all on can gae.’ 8 ‘I wish your bonnie ship rent and rive, And drown you in the sea; For all that would not mend the miss That ye would do to me.’ ‘The miss is not so great, ladye; Soon mended it might be. 9 ‘I have four an twenty milk-white steeds, All foaled in one year; You'll have them, and as much red gold As all their backs can bear.’ 10 She turned her right and round about, And she swore by the mold; ‘I would not be your love,’ said she, ‘For that church full of gold.’ 11 He turned him right and round about, And he swore by the mess; Says, Ladye, ye my love shall be, And gold ye shall have less. 12 She turned her right and round about, And she swore by the moon; ‘I would not be your love,’ says she, ‘For all the gold in Rome.’ 13 He turned him right and round about, And he swore by the moon; Says, Ladye, ye my love shall be, And gold ye shall have none. 14 He caught her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, And there has taken his will of her, Wholly without her leave. 15 The ladye frownd, and sadly blushd, And oh, but she thought shame! Says, If you are a knight at all, You surely will tell me your name. 16 ‘In some places they call me Jack, In other some they call me John; But when into the queen's court, O then Lithcock it is my name!’ 17 ‘Lithcock! Lithcock!’ the ladye said, And oft she spelt it ower again; ‘Lithcock! it's Latin,’ the ladye said, ‘Richard's the English of that name.’ 18 The knight he rode, the ladye ran, A live-long summer's day, Till they came to the wan water That all men do call Tay. 19 He set his horse head to the water, Just thro it for to ride, And the ladye was as ready as him The waters for to wade. 20 For he had never been as kind-hearted As to bid the ladye ride, And she had never been so low-hearted As for to bid him bide. 21 But deep into the wan water There stands a great big stone; He turned his wight horse head about, Said, Ladye fair, will ye loup on? 22 She's taken the wand was in her hand And struck it on the faem, And before he got the middle-stream The ladye was on dry land: ‘By help of God and our Lady, My help lyes not in your hand! 23 ‘I learned it from my mother dear, Few are there that have learned better, When I come to deep water, I can swim thro like ony otter. 24 ‘I learned it from my mother dear, I find I learnd it for my weel, When I come to a deep water, I can swim thro like ony eel.’ 25 ‘Turn back, turn back, you ladye fair, You know not what I see; There is a ladye in that castle That will burn you and me.’ ‘Betide me weel, betide me wae, That ladye I will see.’ 26 She took a ring from her finger, And gave it the porter for his fee; Says, Take you that, my good porter, And bid the queen speak to me. 27 And when she came before the queen, There she fell low down on her knee; Says, There is a knight into your court This day has robbed me. 28 ‘O has he robbed you of your gold, Or has he robbed you of your fee?’ ‘He has not robbed me of my gold, He has not robbed me of my fee; He has robbed me of my maidenhead, The fairest flower of my bodie.’ 29 ‘There is no knight in all my court, That thus has robbed thee, But you'll have the truth of his right hand, Or else for your sake he'll die: 30 ‘Tho it were Earl Richard, my own brother, And, Oh, forbid that it be!’ Then sighing said the ladye fair, I wot the same man is he. 31 The queen called on her merry men, Even fifty men and three; Earl Richard used to be the first man. But now the hindmost man was he. 32 He's taken out one hundred pounds. And told it in his glove; Says, Take you that, my ladye fair, And seek another love. 33 ‘Oh, no! oh, no!’ the ladye cried, ‘That's what shall never be; I'll have the truth of your right hand, The queen it gave to me.’ 34 [‘I wish I'd drunken your water, sister, When I did drink thus of your ale, That for a carl's fair daughter It does me gar dree all this bale!] 35 ‘I wish I had drunk of your water, sister, When I did drink your wine, That for a carle's fair daughter It does gar me dree all this pine!’ 36 ‘May be I am a carle's daughter, And may be never nane; When ye met me in the greenwood, Why did you not let me alane?’ 37 ‘Will you wear the short clothes, Or will you wear the side? Or will you walk to your wedding, Or will you till it ride?’ 38 ‘I will not wear the short clothes, But I will wear the side; I will not walk to my wedding, But I to it will ride.’ 39 When he was set upon the horse, The lady him behin, Then cauld and eerie were the words The twa had them between. 40 She said, Good e'en, ye nettles tall, Just there where ye grow at the dyke; If the auld carline my mother were here, Sae weel's she would your pates pyke! 41 How she would stap you in her poke — I wot at that she wadna fail — And boil ye in her auld brass pan, And of ye make right good kail! 42 And she would meal you with millering, That she gathers at the mill, And make you thick as ony daigh: And when the pan was brimful, 43 Would mess you up in scuttle-dishes, Syne bid us sup till we were fou, Lay down her head upon a poke, Then sleep and snore like ony sow. 44 ‘Away, away, you bad woman! For all your vile words grieveth me; When you hide so little for yourself, I'm sure ye'll hide far less for me. 45 ‘I wish I had drunk your water, sister, When that I did drink of your wine, Since for a carle's fair daughter, It aye gars me dree all this pine.’ 46 ‘May be I am a carle's daughter, And may be never nane; When ye met me in the good greenwood, Why did you not let me alane? 47 ‘Gude een, gude een, ye heather-berries, As ye're growing on yon hill; If the auld carline and her bags were here, I wot she would get meat her fill. 48 ‘Late, late at night, I knit our pokes, With even four an twenty knots; And in the morn at breakfast time I'll carry the keys of an earl's locks. 49 ‘Late, late at night, I knit our pokes, With even four an twenty strings; And if you look to my white fingers, They have as many gay gold rings.’ 50 ‘Away, away, ye ill woman! So sore your vile words grieveth me; When you hide so little for yourself, I'm sure ye'll hide far less for me. 51 ‘But if you are a carle's daughter, As I take you to be, How did you get the gay cloathing In greenwood ye had on thee?’ 52 ‘My mother, she's a poor woman, She nursed earl's children three, And I got them from a foster-sister, For to beguile such sparks as thee.’ 53 ‘But if you be a carle's daughter, As I believe you be, How did you learn the good Latin In greenwood ye spoke to me?’ 54 ‘My mother, she's a mean woman, She nursd earl's children three; I learnt it from their chaplain, To beguile such sparks as ye.’ 55 When mass was sung, and bells were rung, And all men bound for bed, Then Earl Richard and this ladye In ae bed they were laid. 56 He turned his face unto the stock, And she her's to the stane, And cauld and dreary was the love That was these twa between. 57 Great mirth was in the kitchen, Likewise intill the ha, But in his bed lay Earl Richard, Wiping the tears awa. 58 He wept till he fell fast asleep, Then slept till light was come; Then he did hear the gentlemen That talked in the room: 59 Said, Saw ye ever a fitter match, Betwixt the ane and ither, The king of Scotland's fair dochter And the queen of England's brither? 60 ‘And is she the king o Scotland's fair dochter?

For seven times has my steed been saddled, To come to court with thee; And with this witty lady fair, How happy must I be!’ Earl Lithgow THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—F a.

Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 184. 1 Earl Lithgow he's a hunting gane, Upon a summer's day, And he's fa'en in with a weel-far'd maid, Was gathering at the slaes. 2 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve; He led her to the foot of a tree, At her he spierd nae leave. 3 The lassie being well learned, She turned her right around; Says, Will ye be as good, kind sir, As tell to me your name? 4 ‘Whiles they call me Jack,’ he says, ‘And whiles they call me John; But when I'm in the queen's high court, Earl Litchcock is my name.’ 5 The lassie being well learned, She spelld it ower again; Says, Litchcock is a Latin word, But Lithgow is your name. 6 The lassie being well learned, She spelld it ower again; Says, Lithgow is a gentle word, But Richard is your name. 7 She has kilted her green claithing A little abeen her knee; The gentleman rode, and the lassie ran, Till at the water o Dee. 8 When they were at the water o Dee, And at the narrow side, He turned about his high horse head, Says, Lassie, will ye ride? 9 ‘I learned it in my mother's bower, I wish I had learned it better, When I came to this wan water, To swim like ony otter. 10 ‘I learned it in my mother's bower, I wish I had learned it weel, That when I came to a wan water, To swim like ony eel.’ 11 She has kilted her green claithing A little abeen her knee; The gentleman rode, the lassie swam, Thro the water o Dee: Before he was at the middle o the water, At the other side was she. 12 She sat there and drest hersell, And sat upon a stone; There she sat to rest hersell, And see how he'd come on. 13 ‘How mony miles hae ye to ride? How mony hae I to gang?’ ‘I've thirty miles to ride,’ he says, ‘And ye've as mony to gang.’ 14 ‘If ye've thirty miles to ride,’ she says, ‘And I've as mony to gae, Ye'll get leave to gang yoursell; It will never be gane by me.’ 15 She's gane to the queen's high court, And knocked at the pin; Who was sae ready as the proud porter, To let this lady in! 16 She's put her hand in her pocket, And gien him guineas three: ‘Ye will gang to the queen hersell, And tell her this frae me. 17 ‘There is a lady at your yetts Can neither card nor spin; But she can sit in a lady's bower, And lay gold on a seam.’ 18 He's gane ben thro ae lang room, And he's gane ben thro twa, Till he came to a lang, lang trance, And then came to the ha. 19 When he came before the queen, Sat low down on his knee: ‘Win up, win up, my proud porter, What makes this courtesie?’ 20 ‘There is a lady at your yetts Can neither card nor spin; But she can sit in a lady's bower, And lay gold on a seam.’ 21 ‘If there is a lady at my yetts That cannot card nor spin, Ye'll open my yetts baith wide and braid, And let this lady in.’ 22 Now she has gane ben thro ae room, And she's gane ben thro twa, And she gaed ben a lang, lang trance, Till she came to the ha. 23 When she came before the queen, Sat low down on her knee: ‘Win up, win up, my fair woman, What makes such courtesie?’ 24 ‘My errand it's to thee, O queen, My errand it's to thee; There is a man within your courts This day has robbed me.’ 25 ‘O has he taen your purse, your purse, Or taen your penny-fee? Or has he taen your maidenhead, The flower of your bodie?’ 26 ‘He hasna taen my purse, my purse, Nor yet my penny-fee, But he has taen my maidenhead, The flower of my bodi’ 27 ‘It is if he be a batchelor, Your husband he shall be; But if he be a married man, High hanged he shall be. 28 ‘Except it be my brother, Litchcock, I hinna will it be he;’ Sighd and said that gay lady, That very man is he. 29 She's calld on her merry men a', By ane, by twa, by three; Earl Litchcock used to be the first, But the hindmost man was he. 30 He came cripple on the back, Stane blind upon an ee; And sighd and said Earl Richard, I doubt this calls for me. 31 He's laid down a brand, a brand, And next laid down a ring; It's thrice she minted to the brand, But she's taen up the ring: There's not a knight in a' the court, But calld her a wise woman. 32 He's taen out a purse of gold, And tauld it on a stane; Says, Take ye that, my fair woman, And ye'll frae me be gane. 33 ‘I will hae nane o your purse[s] o gold, That ye tell on a stane; But I will hae yoursell,’ she says, ‘Another I'll hae nane.’ 34 He has taen out another purse, And tauld it in a glove; Says, Take ye that, my fair woman, And choice another love. 35 ‘I'll hae nane o your purses o gold, That ye tell in a glove; But I will hae yoursell,’ she says, ‘I'll hae nae ither love.’ 36 But he's taen out another purse, And tauld it on his knee; Said, Take ye that, ye fair woman, Ye'll get nae mair frae me. 37 ‘I'll hae nane o your purses o gold, That ye tell on your knee; But I will hae yoursell,’ she says, ‘The queen has granted it me.’ 38 ‘O will ye hae the short claithing, Or will ye hae the side? Or will ye gang to your wedding, Or will ye to it ride?’ 39 ‘I winna hae the short claithing, But I will hae the side; I winna gang to my wedding, But to it I will ride.’ 40 The first town that they came till They made the mass be sung, And the next town that they came till They made the bells be rung. 41 And the next town that they came till He bought her gay claithing, And the next town that they came till They held a fair wedding. 42 When they came to Mary-kirk, The nettles grew on the dyke: ‘If my auld mither, the carlin, were here, Sae well's she would you pyke. 43 ‘Sae well's she would you pyke,’ she says, ‘She woud you pyke and pou, And wi the dust lyes in the mill Sae woud she mingle you. 44 ‘She'd take a speen intill her hand, And sup ere she be fou, Syne lay her head upon a sod, And snore like ony sow.’ 45 When she came to yon mill-dams, Says, Weel may ye clap; I wyte my minnie neer gaed by you Wanting mony a lick. 46 He's drawn his hat out ower his face, Muckle shame thought he; She's driven her cap out ower her locks, And a light laugh gae she. 47 When they were wedded, and well bedded, And hame at dinner set, Then out it spake our bride hersell, And she spake never blate. 48 Put far awa your china plates, Put them far awa frae me, And bring to me my humble gockies, That I was best used wi. 49 Put far awa your siller speens, Had them far awa frae me, And bring to me my horn cutties, That I was best used wi. 50 When they were dined and well served, And to their dancing set, Out it spake our bride again, For she spake never blate. 51 If the auld carlin, my mither, were here, As I trust she will be, She'll fear the dancing frae us a', And gar her meal-bags flee. 52 When bells were rung, and mass was sung, And a' men bound for rest, Earl Richard and the beggar's daughter In ae chamber were placed. 53 ‘Had far awa your fine claithing, Had them far awa frae me, And bring to me my fleachy clouts, That I was best used wi. 54 ‘Had far awa your holland sheets, Had them far awa frae me, And bring to me my canvas clouts, That I was best used wi. 55 ‘Lay a pock o meal beneath my head, Another aneath my feet, A pock o seeds beneath my knees, And soundly will I sleep.’ 56 ‘Had far awa, ye carlin's get, Had far awa frae me; It disna set a carlin's get My bed-fellow to be.’ 57 ‘It's may be I'm a carlin's get, And may be I am nane; But when ye got me in good greenwood, How letna you me alane?’ 58 ‘It is if you be a carlin's get, As I trust well ye be, Where got ye all the gay claithing You brought to greenwood with thee?’ 59 ‘My mother was an auld nourice, She nursed bairns three; And whiles she got, and whiles she staw, And she kept them a' for me; And I put them on in good greenwood, To beguile fause squires like thee.’ 60 It's out then spake the Billy-Blin, Says, I speak nane out of time; If ye make her lady o nine cities, She'll make you lord o ten. 61 Out it spake the Billy-Blin, Says, The one may serve the other; The King of Gosford's ae daughter, And the Queen of Scotland's brother. 62 ‘Wae but worth you, Billy-Blin, An ill death may ye die! My bed-fellow he'd been for seven years Or he'd kend sae muckle frae me.’ 63 ‘Fair fa ye, ye Billy-Blin, And well may ye aye be! In my stable is the ninth horse I've killd, Seeking this fair ladie: Now we're married, and now we're bedded, And in each other's arms shall lie.’ Jo Janet THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—G Gibb MS., No 1.

Lindsay, about 1800. 1 Jo Janet has to the greenwood gane, Wi a' her maidens free, 2 ‘Some ca me Jack, some ca me John, Some ca me Jing-ga-lee, But when I am in the queen's court Earl Hitchcock they ca me.’ 3 ‘Hitchcock, Hitchcock,’ Jo Janet she said, An spelled it ower agane, ‘Hitchcock it's a Latin word; Earl Richard is your name.’ 4 But when he saw she was book-learned, Fast to his horse hied he; But she kilted up her gay claithing, An fast, fast followed she. 5 Aye he rade, an aye she ran, The live-lang simmer's day, Till they came to the wan water, An a' men call it Tay. 6 She has tane the narrow fuird, An he has tane the wide, An ere he was in the middle-water, Jo Janet was at the ither side. 7 As swift as eel or otter. 8 An when she cam to the queen's court She tirled at the pin, An wha sae ready as the queen hersel To let Jo Janet in! 9 ‘There is a knicht into your court This day has robbed me.’ 10 ‘Has he robbed you o your gold, fair may, Or robbed you o your fee? Or robbed you o your maidenhead, The flower o your bodie?’ 11 ‘He has nae robbed me o my gold,’ she said, ‘Nor o my weel won fee, But he has robbed me o my maidenhead, The flower o my bodie.’ 12 ‘It's if he be a married knight, It's hanged he shall be; But if he be a single knight, It's married ye sall be. 13 ‘There's but three knichts into my court This day hae been frae me, An ane is Earl Richard, my brither, An I hope it is na he:’ Then sichin said Jo Janet, The very same man is he. 14 The queen has called on her merry men By thirty and by three; He wont to be the foremost man, But hinmost in cam he. 15 ‘Is this your tricks abroad, Richard, Is this your tricks abroad, Wheneer ye meet a bonny may To lay her on the road?’ 16 But he took out a purse o gold, Says, Tak you that, my bonny may, An seek nae mair o me. 17 ‘I winna hae your gold,’ she said, ‘I winna hae your fee; I'll hae the troth o your right hand The queen has promised me.’ 18 As they rade bye yon bonny mill-town Sae fair's the nettles grew; Quoth she, If my auld mither were here, Sae finely's she wad you pu. 19 She wad you nip, she wad you clip, Sae finely's she wad you pu, An pit you on in a wee, wee pat, An sup till she were fu, Syne rowe her heid in her gown-tail, An sleep like ony soo. 20 He drew his hat down ower his broos, An a doon look gae he, But she threw her locks out ower her cocks, An nae ways dung was she. 21 ‘It's if ye be a beggar's brat, As I dout na but ye be, It's where gat ye the gay claithing That hings down to your knee?’ 22 ‘My mither was nurse to Earl Marshall's dother, An a fine lady is she, An aye when she gets new claithing She casts the auld to me:’ An sichin said Earl Richard, My ain true-love is she! 23 But if you be a beggar's brat, As I doutna but ye be, Where got ye the Latin words Ye said in greenwood to me? 24 ‘My mither was a bad woman, She served sic men as thee, An a' the gear at ever she got She waired it a' on me, An learned me weel the Latin tongue, To beguile sic sparks as thee.’ 25 ‘Awa, awa, ye ill woman, An ill death mat ye dee! 26 When they were a' at supper set, An siller spoons gaen roun, It's, ‘Haud awa yer siller spoons, Haud them far awa frae me, An bring to me a guid ramshorn, The thing I'm best used wi.’ 27 An when they were at supper set, An the ale-caup gaen about, She took it in her arms twa, An sae clean's she lickit it oot. 28 He drew his hat doun ower his broos, An a doun look gae he, But she threw her locks out ower her cocks, An nae ways dung was she. 29 When mass was sung, and bells were rung, An a' men boun to bed, Earl Richard an Jo Janet In ae bed they were laid. 30 He turned his face unto the stock, An sair, sair did he weep; She turned her face unto the wa, An sound she fell asleep. 31 The Billie Blin stood up at their bed-feet. 32 Said, Saw ye ever a fitter match Atween the tane and the tither, The Earl Marshall['s] ae dother An the Queen o Scotland's brither? 33 ‘Wae be to you for an ill woman, An ill death mat ye dee!

Diddle, &amp;c. 2 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, Gien her a gown o green; ‘O take you that, fair may,’ he says, ‘There's nae mair o me to be seen.’ 3 ‘Since ye have taen your wills o me, Your wills o me you've taen, Since ye have taen your wills o me, Pray tell to me your name.’ 4 ‘O some they call me Jack, lady, And others call me John; But when I'm in the king's court, Sweet William is my name.’ 5 She's kilted up her green clothing A little below her knee, And she is to the king's court, As fast as she could gae. 6 And when she came unto the king, She knelt low on her knee: ‘There is a man into your court This day has robbed me.’ 7 ‘Has he robbd you of your gold,’ he says, ‘Or of your white monie? Or robbd you of the flowery branch, The flower of your bodie?’ 8 ‘He has not robbd me of my gold,’ she says, ‘Nor of my white monie, But he's robbd me of the flowery branch, The flower of my bodie.’ 9 ‘O if he be a bond-man, High hanged shall he be; But if he be a free man, He'se well provide for thee.’ 10 The king's called on his nobles all, By thirty and by three; Sweet William should have been the foremost man, But the hindmost man was he. 11 ‘Do you not mind yon shepherd's daughter, You met on yonder hill? When a' her flocks were feeding round, Of her you took your will.’ 12 And he's taen out a purse o gold, And tied up in a glove; ‘Take you that, fair may,’ he says, ‘And choice for you a love.’ 13 O he's taen out three hundred pounds, Tied up in a purse; ‘See, take you that, fair may,’ he says, ‘And that will pay the nurse.’ 14 ‘I'll neither have your gold,’ she says, ‘Nor yet your white monie, But I will have the king's grant, That he has granted me.’ 15 Then he's taen her on a milk-white steed, Himsell upon another, And to his castle they have rode, Like sister and like brother. 16 O ilka nettle that they came to, ‘O well mote you grow! For mony a day's my minny and me Pilkit at your pow.’ 17 O ilka mill that they came to, ‘O well mote you clack! For monie a day's my minnie and me Buckled up our lap.’ 18 ‘You're the king of England's ae brother, I trust well that you be; I'm the Earl of Stampford's ae daughter, And he has nae mair but me.’ 19 O saw you eer such a near marriage, Between the one and the other, The Earl of Stampford's ae daughter, And the King of England's brother!

Or taen frae you your maidenhead, The flower o your bodie?’ 14 ‘He hasna robbed me o my fine clothing, Nor o my white monie, But he's taen frae me my maidenhead, The flower o my bodie.’ 15 ‘O gin he be a married man, High hanged sall he be; And gin he be a batchelere, Well wedded shall ye be.’ 16 O she has called in her merry young men, By thirties and by threes; Earl Richard should hae been the foremost man, But the hindmost man was he. 17 He cam limpin on a staff, And blinkin on an ee, And sichand says that gay ladie, That samen man is he. The Knight and the Shepherd's Daughter THE KNIGHT AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER—K Motherwell's MS., p. 226. From the recitation of Widow McCormick, Westbrae, Paisley, 1825; learned of an old woman in Dumbarton, thirty or forty years before. 1 There was a shepherd's daughter, Kept sheep on yonder hill; O by comes a courtier, And fain wud hae his will. We'll go no more a roving, A roving in the night, We'll go no more a roving, Let the moon shine neer so bright. O we'll go [no] more a roving. 2 He took her by the middle so small, And by the grass-green sleeve; He bended her body unto the ground, And of her parents he askd no leave. 3 ‘Now since you've got your will o me, And brought my fair bodie to shame, All the request I ask of you is, Pray tell me what's your name.’ 4 ‘O some do call me Jack,’ he says, ‘And some do call me John, But when I am in the king's court, My name is Sweet William.’ 5 She took her petticoats by the band, Her mantle oer her arm, And she's awa to the king's court, As fast as she could run. 6 When she came to the king's court, She tinkled at the ring; Who was so ready as the king himsel To let this fair maid in! 7 And when she came before the king, She kneeled low by his knee; ‘What's this? what's this, fair maid,’ he says, ‘What's this you ask of me?’ 8 ‘There is a knight into your court This day has robbed me.’ 9 ‘If he robbed you of your gold,’ he said, ‘It's hanged he must be; If he's robbed you of your maidenhead, His body I grant to thee.’ 10 ‘He's not robbed me of my gold,’ she said, ‘Nor of my white money, But he's robbed me of my maidenhead, The flower of my bodie.’ 11 He's called down his merry men all, By one, by two, by three; John used to be the foremost man, But the hindmost man was he. 12 He took a long purse of gold And wrapped it in a glove: ‘Here's to thee, my dearest dear, Go seek some other love.’ 13 ‘I'll have none of your gold,’ she says, ‘Nor any of your white money, But I'll just have your own bodie The king has granted to me.’ 14 ‘I wish I was drinking the well-water When I drank of the ale, Before a shepherd's daughter Would tell me such a tale.’ 15 He got her on a milk-white steed, Himself upon a grey, Then on a day This couple rode away. 16 It's when they were coming by the nettlebush, She said, So well may you grow! For many a day my mammy and me Hae pickled at your pow. 17 When they cam by the mill-door, she said, So well may you clatter! For many a day my mammy and me Pickled at your happer. 18 When they came to the king's court, They reckoned up their kin; She was a king's one dochter, And he but a blacksmith's son.

Then she sang downe a downe, hey downe derry (bis) 2 ‘Ioue you speed, fayre lady,’ he said, ‘Among the leaues that be so greene; If I were a king, and wore a crowne, Full soone, fair lady, shouldst thou be a queen. 3 ‘Also Ioue saue you, faire lady, Among the roses that be so red; If I haue not my will of you, Full soone, faire lady, shall I be dead.’ 4 Then he lookt east, then hee lookt west, Hee lookt north, so did he south; He could not finde a priuy place, For all lay in the diuel's mouth. 5 ‘If you will carry me, gentle sir, A mayde vnto my father's hall, Then you shall haue your will of me, Vnder purple and vnder paule.’ 6 He set her vp vpon a steed, And him selfe vpon another, And all the day he rode her by, As though they had been sister and brother. 7 When she came to her father's hall, It was well walled round about; She yode in at the wicket-gate, And shut the foure-eard foole without. 8 ‘You had me,’ quoth she, ‘abroad in the field, Among the corne, amidst the hay, Where you might had your will of mee, For, in good faith, sir, I neuer said nay. 9 ‘Ye had me also amid the field, Among the rushes that were so browne, Where you might had your will of me, But you had not the face to lay me downe.’ 10 He pulled out his nut-browne sword, And wipt the rust off with his sleeue, And said, Ioue's curse come to his heart That any woman would beleeue! 11 When you haue your owne true-loue A mile or twaine out of the towne, Spare not for her gay clothing, But lay her body flat on the ground.

And I will have a special care Of rumpling of your gown a. 3 ‘If you will go along with me Unto my father's hall, sir, You shall enjoy my maidenhead, And my estate and all, sir.’ 4 So he mounted her on a milk-white steed, Himself upon another, And then they rid upon the road, Like sister and like brother. 5 And when she came to her father's house, Which was moated round about, sir, She stepped streight within the gate, And shut this young knight out, sir. 6 ‘Here is a purse of gold,’ she said, ‘Take it for your pains, sir; And I will send my father's man To go home with you again, sir. 7 ‘And if you meet a lady fair, As you go thro the next town, sir, You must not fear the dew of the grass, Nor the rumpling of her gown, sir. 8 ‘And if you meet a lady gay, As you go by the hill, sir, If you will not when you may, You shall not when you will, sir.’ The Baffled Knight, or, The Lady's Policy; or, The Lady's Policy, or, The Baffled Knight THE BAFFLED KNIGHT—C a.

He'll take my steed away, sir.’ 7 ‘I have a ring upon my finger, It's made of the finest gold, love, And it shall serve to fetch your steed Out of the pinner's fold, love.’ 8 ‘And if you'll go to my father's house, Round which there's many a tree, sir, There you shall have your chamber free, And your chamberlain I'll be, sir.’ 9 He sate her on a milk-white steed, Himself upon another, And then they rid along the way, Like sister and like brother. 10 But when she came to her father's house, Which was moated all round about, sir, She slipd herself within the gate, And she lockd the knight without, sir. 11 ‘I thank you, kind knight, for seeing me here, And bringing me home a maiden, sir, But you shall have two of my father's men For to set you as far back again, sir.’ 12 He drew his sword out of his scabbard, And whet it upon his sleeve, sir, Saying, Cursed be to evry man That will a maid believe, sir! 13 She drew her handkerchief out of her pocket, And threw it upon the ground, sir, Saying, Thrice cursed be to evry maid That will believe a man, sir! 14 We have a tree in our garden, Some call it of rosemary, sir; There's crowing-cocks in our town, That will make a capon of you, sir. 15 We have a flower in our garden, Some call it a marygold, sir, And he that would not when he might, He shall not when he would, sir. 16 But if you chance for to meet a maid, A little below the town, sir, You must not fear her gay cloathing, Nor the wrinkling of her gown, sir. 17 And if you chance for to meet a maid, A little below the hill, sir, You need not fear her screeking out, For she quickly will lye still, sir. 18 The baffld knight was by the lass Ingeniously outwitted, And since that time it came to pass He was again well fitted. 19 As he was riding cross a plain, In boots, spurs, hat and feather, He met that lady fair again; They talkd a while together. 20 He said, Tho you did serve me so, And cunningly decoy me, Yet now, before you further go, I must and will enjoy thee. 21 'Twas near a spacious river's side, Where rushes green were growing, And Neptune's silver streams did glide, Four fathom waters flowing. 22 The lady blushd like scarlet red, And trembled at this stranger: ‘How shall I guard my maidenhead From this approaching danger!’ 23 With a lamenting sigh, said she, To dye I now am ready; Must this dishonour fall on me? A most unhappy lady! 24 He from his saddle did alight, In gaudy rich attire, And cried, I am a noble knight, Who do your charms admire. 25 He took the lady by the hand, Who seemingly consented, And woud no more disputing stand: She had a plot invented 26 How she might baffle him again, With much delight and pleasure, And eke unspotted still remain, With her pure virgin treasure. 27 ‘Look yonder, good sir knight, I pray: Methinks I do discover, Well mounted on a dapple-grey, My true, entire lover.’ 28 The knight, he standing on the brink Of the deep floating river, Thought she, Thou now shalt swim or sink; Choose which you fancy rather. 29 Against his back the lady run; The waters strait he sounded; He cry'd out, Love, what have you done! Help! help! or I am drowned. 30 Said she, Sir knight, farewel, adieu; You see what comes of fooling; That is the fittest place for you, Whose courage wanted cooling. 31 ‘Love, help me out, and I'll forgive This fault which you've committed;’ ‘No, no,’ says she, ‘sir, as I live, I think you're finely fitted.’ 32 She rid home to her father's house, For speedy expedition, While the gay knight was soakd like souce, In a sad wet condition. 33 When he came mounted to the plain He was in rich attire, Yet when he back returnd again He was all muck and mire. 34 A solemn vow he there did make, Just as he came from swiming, He'd love no lady, for her sake, Nor any other women. 35 The baffld knight was foold once more, You'll find by this pleasant ditty, For she whose charms he did adore Was wonderful sharp and witty. 36 Returning from her father's park, Just close by a summer bower, She chanc'd to meet her angry spark, Who gave her a frowning lower. 37 The thoughts of what she twice had done Did cause him to draw his rapier, And at the lady then he run, And thus he began to vapour: 38 ‘You chousd me at your father's gate, Then tumbld me into the river; I seek for satisfaction straight, Shall I be a fool forever?’ 39 He came with resolution bent That evening to enjoy her, And if she did not give consent, That minute he would destroy her. 40 ‘I pray, sir knight, and why so hot Against a young silly woman? Such crimes as these might be forgot; For merry intrigues are common.’ 41 ‘What! do you count it mirth,’ he cry'd, ‘To tumble me in and leave me? What if I drowned there had dy'd? A dangerous jest, believe me. 42 ‘Well, if I pardon you this day Those injuries out of measure, It is because without delay I mean to enjoy the pleasure.’ 43 ‘Your suit,’ she said, ‘is not deny'd, But think of your boots of leather, And let me pull them off,’ she cry'd, ‘Before we lye down together.’ 44 He set him down upon the grass, And violets so sweet and tender; Now by this means it came to pass That she did his purpose hinder. 45 For having pulld his boots half-way, She cry'd, I am now your betters; You shall not make of me your prey; Sit there, like a thief in fetters. 46 Now finding she had servd him so, He rose and began to grumble; Yet he could neither stand nor go, But did like a cripple tumble. 47 The boots stuck fast, and would not stir; His folly she soon did mention, And laughing said, I pray, kind sir, How like you my new invention? 48 My laughing fit you must excuse; You are but a stingless nettle; You'd neer a stood for boots or shooes, Had you been a man of mettle. 49 Farewel, sir knight, 't is almost ten; I fear neither wind nor weather; I'll send my father's serving-men To pull off your boots of leather. 50 She laughd outright, as well she might, With merry conceits of scorning, And left him there to sit all night, Untill the approaching morning. 51 The fourth part of the baffld knight The lady hath fairly acted; She did his love and kindness slight, Which made him almost distracted. 52 She left him in her father's park, Where nothing but deer could hear him; While he lay rouling in the dark, There's never a soul came near him. 53 Until the morning break of day, And being warm summer weather, A shepherd chanc'd to come that way, Who pulld on his boots of leather. 54 Then mounting on his milk-white steed, He, shaking his ears, was ready, And whip and spur he rid with speed To find out this crafty lady. 55 ‘If once this lady I come nigh She shall be releasd by no man: Why shoud so brave a knight as I Be foold by a silly woman! 56 ‘Three times she has affronted me, In crimes which I cannot pardon; But if I an't revengd,’ said he, ‘Let me not be worth a farthing. 57 ‘I value not her beauty fair, Tho once I did dote upon her; This trusty sword shall now repair My baffled, blasted honour.’ 58 Unto her father's house he came, Which every side was moated; The fair sweet youthful charming dame, His angry brows she noted. 59 Thought she, I'll have the other bout, And tumble him in the river; And let the Devil help him out, Or there he shall soak for ever. 60 He will not let me live at rest, Although I have often foild him; Therefore once more, I do protest, With flattering I'll beguile him. 61 The bridge was drawn, the gates lockd fast, So that he could no ways enter; She smil'd to him, and cry'd at last, Sir knight, if you please to venture, 62 A plank lies over the moat hard by, Full seventeen foot in measure; There's no body now at home but I; Therefore we'll take our pleasure. 63 This word she had no sooner spoke, But straight he was tripping over; The plank was sawd, and snapping broke; He provd an unhappy lover.

Sheets nor blankets have I none, To keep thy cloathing clean, maid.’ 3 ‘The wind blaws east, the wind blaws west, The wind blaws owre yon thorn, sir; Weel may I wash my cloathing clear, And dry them on the morn, sir.’ 4 ‘What if I should lay thee down, Amang the rigs of corn, maid? Then the king's life-guard will come, And steal our steeds away, maid.’ 5 ‘I have ten gold rings on my hand, They're all gold but the stone, sir; I'll give them to the king's life-guard, If he'll let our steeds alone, sir. 6 ‘But see you not yon sunny bank, Over yon lily lea, sir, Where you and I may crack a while, And never one may see, sir?’ 7 He was on a milk-white steed, And she was on another, And all the live-long winter night They rode like sister and brother. 8 When they came to that sunny bank, He began to lay her down, sir; ‘O no, O no, kind sir,’ she says, ‘Ye'll ruffle all my gown, sir. 9 ‘My gown it cost my father dear, 'Twas many a mark and pound, sir; And if that ye do lay me down, Ye'll ruffle all my gown, sir. 10 ‘But see ye na yon fair castel, Over yon lily lea, sir, Where you and I may crack a while, And never one may see, sir?’ 11 He was on a milk-white steed, And she was on another, And all the live-long winter night They rode like sister and brother. 12 When they came to that fair castel, She was at her father's yet, sir; She jumped in at her father's door, And left this knight without, sir. 13 She says, I am a maid within, You're but a knave without, sir; There were neer a butcher's son Put me in so much doubt, sir. 14 ‘Oh if I had thee out,’ he said, ‘But two miles from the town, maid, I would lay thee down,’ he said, ‘And never mind thy gown, maid.’ 15 ‘There is a flower in my father's garden, The name o't marigold, sir, And he that would not when he might, He shall not when he wold, sir. 16 ‘But when eer ye meet a pretty maid, And two miles from a town, sir, Ye may lay her down,’ she says, ‘And never mind her gown, sir. 17 ‘Ye're like unto my father's steed; He's standing in the lone, sir; He hings his head above the sheaf, But daur not venture on, sir. 18 ‘When eer ye meet a pretty maid, And two miles from the town, sir, Ye may lay her down,’ she says, ‘And never mind her gown, sir. 19 ‘There is a cock in my father's flock, He wears a double comb, sir, He claps his wings, but craweth not; I fear you be like him, sir. 20 ‘But when eer you meet a pretty maid, And two miles from a town, sir, You may lay her down,’ she said, ‘And never mind her gown, sir.’ 113 THE GREAT SILKIE OF SULE SKERRY THE GREAT SILKIE OF SULE SKERRY Proceedings of The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, I, 86, 1852.

Nithsdale. 1 Johnie rose up in a May morning, Called for water to wash his hands: ‘Gar loose to me the gude graie dogs, That are bound wi iron bands.’ 2 When Johnie's mother gat word o that, Her hands for dule she wrang: ‘O Johnie, for my bennison, To the grenewood dinna gang! 3 ‘Eneugh ye hae o the gude wheat-bread, And eneugh o the blude-red wine, And therefore for nae vennison, Johnie, I pray ye, stir frae hame.’ 4 But Johnie's buskt up his gude bend bow, His arrows, ane by ane, And he has gane to Durrisdeer, To hunt the dun deer down. 5 As he came down by Merriemass, And in by the benty line, There has he espied a deer lying, Aneath a bush of ling. 6 Johnie he shot, and the dun deer lap, And he wounded her on the side, But atween the water and the brae, His hounds they laid her pride. 7 And Johnie has bryttled the deer sae weel That he's had out her liver and lungs, And wi these he has feasted his bludey hounds As if they had been erl's sons. 8 They eat sae much o the vennison, And drank sae much o the blude, That Johnie and a' his bludey hounds Fell asleep as they had been dead. 9 And by there came a silly auld carle, An ill death mote he die! For he's awa to Hislinton, Where the Seven Foresters did lie. 10 ‘What news, what news, ye gray-headed carle? What news bring ye to me?’ ‘I bring nae news,’ said the gray-headed carle, ‘Save what these eyes did see. 11 ‘As I came down by Merriemass, And down amang the scroggs, The bonniest childe that ever I saw Lay sleeping amang his dogs. 12 ‘The shirt that was upon his back Was o the holland fine; The doublet which was over that Was o the Lincome twine. 13 ‘The buttons that were on his sleeve Were o the gowd sae gude; The gude graie hounds he lay amang, Their mouths were dyed wi blude.’ 14 Then out and spak the first forester, The heid man ower them a': If this be Johnie o Breadislee, Nae nearer will we draw. 15 But up and spak the sixth forester, His sister's son was he: If this be Johnie o Breadislee, We soon shall gar him die. 16 The first flight of arrows the foresters shot, They wounded him on the knee; And out and spak the seventh forester, The next will gar him die. 17 Johnie's set his back against an aik, His fute against a stane, And he has slain the Seven Foresters, He has slain them a' but ane. 18 He has broke three ribs in that ane's side, But and his collar bane; He's laid him twa-fald ower his steed, Bade him carry the tidings hame. 19 ‘O is there na a bonnie bird Can sing as I can say, Could flee away to my mother's bower, And tell to fetch Johnie away?’ 20 The starling flew to his mother's windowstane, It whistled and it sang, And aye the ower-word o the tune Was, Johnie tarries lang! 21 They made a rod o the hazel-bush, Another o the slae-thorn tree, And mony, mony were the men At fetching our Johnie. 22 Then out and spake his auld mother, And fast her teirs did fa; Ye wad nae be warnd, my son Johnie, Frae the hunting to bide awa. 23 ‘Aft hae I brought to Breadislee The less gear and the mair, But I neer brought to Breadislee What grieved my heart sae sair. 24 ‘But wae betyde that silly auld carle, An ill death shall he die; For the highest tree on Merriemass Shall be his morning's fee.’ 25 Now Johnie's gude bend bow is broke, And his gude graie dogs are slain, And his bodie lies dead in Durrisdeer, And his hunting it is done.

Johnnie o Cocklesmuir JOHNIE COCK—H Buchan's MSS, I, 82; Dixon, Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 77, Percy Society, vol. xvii. 1 Johnnie raise up in a May morning, Calld for water to wash his hands, And he's commant his bluidy dogs To be loosd frae their iron bands. bands To be loosd frae their iron bands 2 ‘Win up, win up, my bluidy dogs, Win up, and be unbound, And we will on to Bride's Braidmuir, And ding the dun deer down.’ 3 When his mother got word o that, Then she took bed and lay; Says, Johnnie, my son, for my blessing, Ye'll stay at hame this day. 4 There's baken bread and brown ale Shall be at your command; Ye'll win your mither's blythe blessing, To the Bride's Braidmuir nae gang. 5 Mony are my friends, mither, Though thousands were my foe; Betide me life, betide me death, To the Bride's Braidmuir I'll go. 6 The sark that was on Johnnie's back Was o the cambric fine; The belt that was around his middle Wi pearlins it did shine. 7 The coat that was upon his back Was o the linsey brown; And he's awa to the Bride's Braidmuir, To ding the dun deer down. 8 Johnnie lookd east, Johnnie lookd west, And turnd him round and round, And there he saw the king's dun deer, Was cowing the bush o brune. 9 Johnnie shot, and the dun deer lap, He wounded her in the side; Between him and yon burnie-bank, Johnnie he laid her pride. 10 He ate sae muckle o the venison, He drank sae muckle bleed, Till he lay down between his hounds, And slept as he'd been dead. 11 But by there came a stane-auld man, An ill death mat he dee! For he is on to the Seven Foresters, As fast as gang could he. 12 ‘What news, what news, ye stane-auld man? What news hae ye brought you wi?’ ‘Nae news, nae news, ye seven foresters, But what your eyes will see. 13 ‘As I gaed i yon rough thick hedge, Amang yon bramly scroggs, The fairest youth that eer I saw Lay sleeping between his dogs. 14 ‘The sark that was upon his back Was o the cambric fine; The belt that was around his middle Wi pearlins it did shine.’ 15 Then out it speaks the first forester: Whether this be true or no, O if it's Johnnie o Cocklesmuir, Nae forder need we go. 16 Out it spake the second forester, A fierce fellow was he: Betide me life, betide me death, This youth we'll go and see. 17 As they gaed in yon rough thick hedge, And down yon forest gay, They came to that very same place Where John o Cockis he lay. 18 The first an shot they shot at him, They wounded him in the thigh; Out spake the first forester's son: By the next shot he maun die. 19 ‘O stand ye true, my trusty bow, And stout steel never fail! Avenge me now on all my foes, Who have my life i bail.’ 20 Then Johnnie killd six foresters, And wounded the seventh sair; Then drew a stroke at the stane-auld man, That words he neer spake mair. 21 His mother's parrot in window sat, She whistled and she sang, And aye the owerturn o the note, ‘Young Johnnie's biding lang.’ 22 When this reached the king's own ears, It grievd him wondrous sair; Says, I'd rather they'd hurt my subjects all Than Johnnie o Cocklesmuir. 23 ‘But where are all my wall-wight men, That I pay meat and fee, Will gang the morn to Johnnie's castle, See how the cause may be.’ 24 Then he's calld Johnnie up to court, Treated him handsomelie, And now to hunt in the Bride's Braidmuir, For life has license free.

I wonder ye dinna think shame, You being seven sturdy men, And I but a man my lane. 5 ‘Now fail me not, my ten fingers, That are both long and small! Now fail me not, my noble heart! For in thee I trust for all. 6 ‘Now fail me not, my good bend bow, That was in London coft! Now fail me not, my golden string, Which my true lover wrocht!’ 7 He has tossed him up, he has tossed him doun, He has broken his collar-bone; He has tied him to his bridle reins, Bade him carry the tidings home.

Lyghtly let in thyne husbande, Wyllyam of Cloudesle.’ 12 ‘Alas!’ then sayde fayre Alyce, And syghed wonderous sore, ‘Thys place hath ben besette for you Thys halfe yere and more.’ 13 ‘Now am I here,’ sayde Cloudesle, ‘I woulde that I in were; Now feche vs meate and drynke ynoughe, And let vs make good chere.’ 14 She feched him meat and drynke plenty, Lyke a true wedded wyfe, And pleased hym with that she had, Whome she loued as her lyfe. 15 There lay an old wyfe in that place, A lytle besyde the fyre, Whych Wyllyam had found, of cherytye, More then seuen yere. 16 Up she rose; and walked full styll, Euel mote she spede therefoore! For she had not set no fote on ground In seuen yere before. 17 She went vnto the justice hall, As fast as she could hye: ‘Thys nyght is come vn to thys town Wyllyam of Cloudesle.’ 18 Thereof the iustice was full fayne, And so was the shirife also: ‘Thou shalt not trauaile hether, dame, for nought; Thy meed thou shalt haue or thou go.’ 19 They gaue to her a ryght good goune, Of scarlat it was, as I heard say[n]e; She toke the gyft, and home she wente, And couched her doune agayne. 20 They rysed the towne of mery Carlel, In all the hast that they can, And came thronging to Wyllyames house, As fast [as] they might gone. 21 Theyr they besette that good yeman, Round about on euery syde; Wyllyam hearde great noyse of folkes, That heytherward they hyed. 22 Alyce opened a shot-wyndow, And loked all about; She was ware of the justice and the shrife bothe, Wyth a full great route. 23 ‘Alas! treason,’ cryed Alyce, ‘Euer wo may thou be! Go into my chambre, my husband,’ she sayd, ‘Swete Wyllyam of Cloudesle.’ 24 He toke hys sweard and hys bucler, Hys bow and hy[s] chyldren thre, And wente into hys strongest chamber, Where he thought surest to be. 25 Fayre Alice folowed him as a louer true, With a pollaxe in her hande: ‘He shalbe deade that here cometh in Thys dore, whyle I may stand.’ 26 Cloudesle bent a wel good bowe, That was of trusty tre, He smot the justise on the brest, That hys arrowe brest in thre. 27 ‘God's curse on his hartt,’ saide William, ‘Thys day thy cote dyd on; If it had ben no better then myne, It had gone nere thy bone.’ 28 ‘Yelde the, Cloudesle,’ sayd the justise, ‘And thy bowe and thy arrowes the fro:’ ‘Gods curse on hys hart,’ sayde fair Al[i]ce, ‘That my husband councelleth so.’ 29 ‘Set fyre on the house,’ saide the sherife, ‘Syth it wyll no better be, And brenne we therin William,’ he saide, ‘Hys wyfe and chyldren thre.’ 30 They fyred the house in many a place, The fyre flew vpon hye; ‘Alas!’ than cryed fayr Alice, ‘I se we shall here dy.’ 31 William openyd hys backe wyndow, That was in hys chambre on hye, And wyth shetes let hys wyfe downe, And hys chyldren thre. 32 ‘Haue here my treasure,’ sayde William, ‘My wyfe and my chyldren thre; For Christes loue do them no harme, But wreke you all on me.’ 33 Wyllyam shot so wonderous well, Tyll hys arrowes were all go, And the fyre so fast vpon hym fell, That hys bo[w]stryng brent in two. 34 The spercles brent and fell hym on, Good Wyllyam of Cloudesle; But than was he a wofull man, and sayde, Thys is a cowardes death to me. 35 ‘Leuer I had,’ sayde Wyllyam, ‘With my sworde in the route to renne, Then here among myne ennemyes wode Thus cruelly to bren.’ 36 He toke hys sweard and hys buckler, And among them all he ran; Where the people were most in prece, He smot downe many a man. 37 There myght no man stand hys stroke, So fersly on them he ran; Then they threw wyndowes and dores on him, And so toke that good yeman. 38 There they hym bounde both hand and fote, And in depe dongeon hym cast; ‘Now, Cloudesle,’ sayde the hye justice, ‘Thou shalt be hanged in hast.’ 39 ‘One vow shal I make,’ sayde the sherife, ‘A payre of new galowes shall I for the make, And al the gates of Caerlel shalbe shutte, There shall no man come in therat. 40 ‘Then shall not helpe Clim of the Cloughe, Nor yet Adam Bell, Though they came with a thousand mo, Nor all the deuels in hell.’ 41 Early in the mornyng the justice vprose, To the gates fast gan he gon, And commaunded to be shut full cloce Lightile euerychone. 42 Then went he to the market-place, As fast as he coulde hye; A payre of new gallous there dyd he vp set, Besyde the pyllory. 43 A lytle boy stod them amonge, And asked what meaned that gallow-tre; They sayde, To hange a good yeaman, Called Wyllyam of Cloudesle. 44 That lytle boye was the towne swyne-heard, And kept fayre Alyce swyne; Full oft he had sene Cloudesle in the wodde, And geuen hym there to dyne. 45 He went out of a creues in the wall, And lightly to the woode dyd gone; There met he with these wyght yonge men, Shortly and anone. 46 ‘Alas!’ then sayde that lytle boye, ‘Ye tary here all to longe; Cloudesle is taken and dampned to death, All readye for to honge.’ 47 ‘Alas!’ then sayde good Adam Bell, ‘That euer we see thys daye! He myght her with vs haue dwelled, So ofte as we dyd him praye. 48 ‘He myght haue taryed in grene foreste, Under the shadowes sheene, And haue kepte both hym and vs in reaste, Out of trouble and teene.’ 49 Adam bent a ryght good bow, A great hart sone had he slayne; ‘Take that, chylde,’ he sayde, ‘to thy dynner, And bryng me myne arrowe agayne.’ 50 ‘Now go we hence,’ sayed these wight yong men, ‘Tary we no lenger here; We shall hym borowe, by Gods grace, Though we bye it full dere.’ 51 To Caerlel went these good yemen, In a mery mornyng of Maye: Her is a fyt of Cloudesli, And another is for to saye. 52 And when they came to mery Caerlell, In a fayre mornyng-tyde, They founde the gates shut them vntyll, Round about on euery syde. 53 ‘Alas!’ than sayd good Adam Bell, ‘That euer we were made men! These gates be shyt so wonderly well, That we may not come here in.’ 54 Than spake Clymme of the Cloughe: With a wyle we wyll vs in brynge; Let vs say we be messengers, Streyght comen from oure kynge. 55 Adam sayd, I haue a lettre wryten wele, Now let vs wysely werke; We wyll say we haue the kynges seale, I holde the porter no clerke. 56 Than Adam Bell bete on the gate, With strökes greate and stronge; The porter herde suche a noyse therate, And to the gate faste he thronge. 57 ‘Who is there nowe,’ sayd the porter, ‘That maketh all this knockynge? ‘We be two messengers,’ sayd Clymme of the Clo[ughe], ‘Be comen streyght frome oure kynge.’ 58 ‘We haue a lettre,’ sayd Adam Bell, ‘To the justyce we must it brynge; Let vs in, oure message to do, That we were agayne to our kynge.’ 59 ‘Here cometh no man in,’ sayd the porter, ‘By hym that dyed on a tre, Tyll a false thefe be hanged, Called Wyllyam of Clowdysle.’ 60 Than spake that good [yeman Clym of the Cloughe, And swore by Mary fre, If that we stande long wythout, Lyke a thefe hanged shalt thou be.] 61 [Lo here] we haue got the kynges seale; [What! l]ordane, arte thou wode? [The p]orter had wende it had been so, [And l]yghtly dyd of his hode. 62 ‘[Welco]me be my lordes seale,’ sayd he, ‘[For] that shall ye come in:’ [He] opened the gate ryght shortly, [An] euyll openynge for hym! 63 ‘[N]owe we are in,’ sayd Adam Bell, ‘[T]herof we are full fayne; [But] Cryst knoweth that herowed hell, [H]ow we shall come oute agayne.’ 64 ‘[Had] we the keys,’ sayd Clym of the Clowgh, ‘Ryght well than sholde we spede; [Than] myght we come out well ynough, [Whan] we se tyme and nede.’ 65 [They] called the porter to a councell, [And] wronge hys necke in two, [And] kest hym in a depe dongeon, [And] toke the keys hym fro. 66 ‘[N]ow am I porter,’ sayd Adam Bell; ‘[Se], broder, the keys haue we here; [The] worste porter to mery Carlell, [That ye] had this hondreth yere. 67 ‘[Now] wyll we oure bowës bende, [Into the t]owne wyll we go, [For to delyuer our dere] broder, [Where he lyeth in care and wo.’ 68 Then they bent theyr good yew bowes, And loked theyr stringes were round;] The market-place of mery Carlyll, They beset in that stounde. 69 And as they loked them besyde, A payre of newe galowes there they se, And the iustyce, with a quest of swerers, That had iuged Clowdysle there hanged to be. 70 And Clowdysle hymselfe lay redy in a carte, Fast bounde bothe fote and hande, And a strong rope aboute his necke, All redy for to be hangde. 71 The iustyce called to hym a ladde; Clowdysles clothes sholde he haue, To take the mesure of that good yoman, And therafter to make his graue. 72 ‘I haue sene as greate a merueyll,’ sayd Clowd[esle], ‘As bytwene this and pryme, He that maketh thys graue for me, Hymselfe may lye therin.’ 73 ‘Thou spekest proudely,’ sayd the iustyce; ‘I shall hange the with my hande:’ Full well that herde his bretheren two, There styll as they dyd stande. 74 Than Clowdysle cast hys eyen asyde, And sawe hys bretheren stande, At a corner of the market-place, With theyr good bowes bent in theyr hand, Redy the iustyce for to chase. 75 ‘I se good comforte,’ sayd Clowdysle, ‘Yet hope I well to fare; If I myght haue my handes at wyll, [Ryght l]ytell wolde I care.’ 76 [Than b]espake good Adam Bell, [To Clym]me of the Clowgh so fre; [Broder], se ye marke the iustyce well; [Lo yon]der ye may him se. 77 [And at] the sheryf shote I wyll, [Stron]gly with an arowe kene; [A better] shotte in mery Carlyll, [Thys se]uen yere was not sene. 78 [They lo]used theyr arowes bothe at ones, [Of no] man had they drede; [The one] hyt the iustyce, the other the sheryf, [That b]othe theyr sydes gan blede. 79 [All men] voyded, that them stode nye, [Whan] the iustyce fell to the grounde, [And the] sheryf fell nyghe hym by; [Eyther] had his dethës wounde. 80 [All the c]ytezeyns fast gan fle, [They du]rste no lenger abyde; [There ly]ghtly they loused Clowdysle, [Where he] with ropes lay tyde. 81 [Wyllyam] sterte to an offycer of the towne, [Hys axe] out his hande he wronge; [On eche] syde he smote them downe, [Hym tho]ught he had taryed to longe. 82 [Wyllyam] sayd to his bretheren two, [Thys daye] let vs togyder lyue and deye; [If euer you] haue nede as I haue nowe, [The same] shall ye fynde by me. 83 [They] shyt so well in that tyde, For theyr strynges were of sylke full sure, That they kepte the stretes on euery syde; That batayll dyd longe endure. 84 They fought togyder as bretheren true, Lyke hardy men and bolde; Many a man to the grounde they threwe, And made many an hertë colde. 85 But whan theyr arowes were all gone, Men presyd on them full fast; They drewe theyr swerdës than anone, And theyr bowës from them caste. 86 They wente lyghtly on theyr waye, With swerdes and buckelers rounde; By that it was the myddes of the daye, They had made many a wounde. 87 There was many a noute-horne in Carlyll blowen, And the belles backwarde dyd they rynge; Many a woman sayd alas, And many theyr handes dyd wrynge. 88 The mayre of Carlyll forth come was, And with hym a full grete route; These thre yomen dredde hym full sore, For theyr lyuës stode in doubte. 89 The mayre came armed, a full greate pace, With a polaxe in his hande; Many a stronge man with hym was, There in that stoure to stande. 90 The mayre smote at Clowdysle with his byll, His buckeler he brast in two; Full many a yoman with grete yll, ‘[Al]as, treason!’ they cryed for wo. ‘[Ke]pe we the gates fast,’ they bad, ‘[T]hat these traytours theroute not go.’ 91 But all for nought was that they wrought, For so fast they downe were layde Tyll they all thre, that so manfully fought, Were goten without at a brayde. 92 ‘Haue here your keys,’ sayd Adam Bell, ‘Myne offyce I here forsake; Yf ye do by my councell, A newë porter ye make.’ 93 He threwe the keys there at theyr hedes, And bad them evyll to thryue, And all that letteth ony good yoman To come and comforte his wyue. 94 Thus be these good yomen gone to the wode, As lyght as lefe on lynde; They laughe and be mery in theyr mode, Theyr enemyes were farre behynde. 95 Whan they came to Inglyswode, Under theyr trysty-tre, There they founde bowës full gode, And arowës greate plentë. 96 ‘So helpe me God,’ sayd Adam Bell, And Clymme of the Clowgh so fre, ‘I wolde we were nowe in mery Carlell, [Be]fore that fayre meynë.’ 97 They set them downe and made good chere, And eate an[d dr]anke full well: Here is a fytte [of] these wyght yongemen, And another I shall you tell. 98 As they sat in Inglyswode, Under theyr trysty-tre, Them thought they herde a woman [wepe], But her they myght not se. 99 Sore syghed there fayre Alyce, and sayd, Alas that euer I se this daye! For now is my dere husbonde slayne, Alas and welawaye! 100 Myght I haue spoken wyth hys dere breth-[eren], With eyther of them twayne, [To shew to them what him befell] My herte were out of payne. 101 Clowdysle walked a lytell besyde, And loked vnder the grene wodde lynde; He was ware of his wyfe and his chyldre[n thre], Full wo in herte and mynde. 102 ‘Welcome, wyfe,’ than sayd Wyllyam, ‘Unto this trysty-tre; I had wende yesterdaye, by swete Sai[nt John], Thou sholde me neuer haue se.’ 103 ‘Now wele is me,’ she sayd, ‘that [ye be here], My herte is out of wo:’ ‘Dame,’ he sayd, ‘be mery and glad, And thanke my bretheren two.’ 104 ‘Here of to speke,’ sayd Ad[am] Bell, ‘I-wys it [is no bote]; The me[at that we must supp withall, It runneth yet fast on fote.’ 105 Then went they down into a launde, These noble archares all thre, Eche of the]m slewe a harte of grece, [The best t]hey coude there se. 106 ‘[Haue here the] best, Alyce my wyfe,’ [Sayde Wyllya]m of Clowdysle, ‘[By cause ye so] boldely stode me by, [Whan I w]as slayne full nye.’ 107 [Than they] wente to theyr souper, [Wyth suc]he mete as they had, [And than]ked God of theyr fortune; [They we]re bothe mery and glad. 108 [And whan] they had souped well, [Certayne] withouten leace, [Clowdysle] sayde, We wyll to oure kynge, [To get v]s a chartre of peace. 109 [Alyce shal] be at soiournynge, [In a nunry] here besyde; [My tow sonn]es shall with her go, [And ther the]y shall abyde. 110 [Myne eldest so]ne shall go with me, [For hym haue I] no care, [And he shall breng] you worde agayne [How that we do fare. 111 Thus be these wig]ht men to London gone, [As fast as they ma]ye hye, [Tyll they came to the kynges] palays, There they woulde nedës be. 112 And whan they came to the kyngës courte, Unto the pallace gate, Of no man wold they aske leue, But boldly went in therat. 113 They preced prestly into the hall, Of no man had they dreade; The porter came after and dyd them call, And with them began to [chyde.] 114 The vssher sayd, Yemen, what wolde ye haue? I praye you tell me; Ye myght thus make offycers shent: Good syrs, of whens be ye? 115 ‘Syr, we be outlawes of the forest, Certayne withouten leace, And hyther we be come to our kynge, To get vs a charter of peace.’ 116 And whan they came before our kynge, As it was the lawe of the lande, They kneled downe without lettynge, And eche helde vp his hande. 117 They sayd, Lorde, we beseche you here, That ye wyll graunte vs grace, For we haue slayne your fatte falowe dere, In many a sondry place. 118 ‘What is your names?’ than sayd our kynge, ‘Anone that you tell me:’ They sayd, Adam Bell, Clym of the Clough, And Wylliam of Clowdesle. 119 ‘Be ye those theues,’ than sayd our kynge, ‘That men haue tolde of to me? Here to God I make a vowe, Ye shall be hanged all thre. 120 ‘Ye shall be dead without mercy, As I am kynge of this lande:’ He commanded his officers euerichone Fast on them to lay hand. 121 There they toke these good yemen, And arested them all thre: ‘So may I thryue,’ sayd Adam Bell, ‘Thys game lyketh not me. 122 ‘But, good lorde, we beseche you nowe, That ye wyll graunte vs grace, In so moche as we be to you commen; Or elles that we may fro you passe, 123 ‘With suche weapons as we haue here, Tyll we be out of your place; And yf we lyue this hondred yere, We wyll aske you no grace.’ 124 ‘Ye speke proudly,’ sayd the kynge, ‘Ye shall be hanged all thre:’ ‘That were great pity,’ sayd the quene, ‘If any grace myght be. 125 ‘My lorde, whan I came fyrst in to this lande, To be your wedded wyfe, The fyrst bone that I wolde aske, Ye wolde graunte me belyfe. 126 ‘And I asked you neuer none tyll nowe, Therfore, good lorde, graunte it me:’ ‘Nowe aske it, madame,’ sayd the kynge, ‘And graunted shall it be.’ 127 ‘Than, good lorde, I you beseche, The yemen graunte you me:’ ‘Madame, ye myght haue asked a bone That sholde haue ben worthe them thre. 128 ‘Ye myght haue asked towres and towne[s], Parkes and forestes plentie:’ ‘None so pleasaunt to mi pay,’ she said, ‘Nor none so lefe to me.’ 129 ‘Madame, sith it is your desyre, Your askyng graunted shalbe; But I had leuer haue geuen you Good market-townës thre.’ 130 The quene was a glad woman, And sayd, Lord, gramarcy; I dare vndertake for them That true men shall they be. 131 But, good lord, speke som mery word, That comfort they may se: ‘I graunt you grace,’ then said our king, ‘Wasshe, felos, and to meate go ye.’ 132 They had not setten but a whyle, Certayne without lesynge, There came messengers out of the north, With letters to our kyng. 133 And whan the came before the kynge, The kneled downe vpon theyr kne, And sayd, Lord, your offycers grete you wel, Of Caerlel in the north cuntre. 134 ‘How fare[th] my justice,’ sayd the kyng, ‘And my sherife also?’ ‘Syr, they be slayne, without leasynge, And many an officer mo.’ 135 ‘Who hath them slayne?’ sayd the kyng, ‘Anone thou tell me:’ ‘Adam Bel, and Clime of the Clough, And Wyllyam of Cloudesle.’ 136 ‘Alas for rewth!’ then sayd our kynge, ‘My hart is wonderous sore; I had leuer [th]an a thousand pounde I had knowne of thys before. 137 ‘For I haue y-graunted them grace, And that forthynketh me; But had I knowne all thys before, They had ben hanged all thre.’ 138 The kyng opened the letter anone, Hym selfe he red it tho, And founde how these thre outlawes had slaine Thre hundred men and mo. 139 Fyrst the justice and the sheryfe, And the mayre of Caerlel towne; Of all the constables and catchipolles Alyue were left not one. 140 The baylyes and the bedyls both, And the sergeauntes of the law, And forty fosters of the fe These outlawes had y-slaw; 141 And broken his parks, and slaine his dere; Ouer all they chose the best; So perelous outlawes as they were Walked not by easte nor west. 142 When the kynge this letter had red, In hys harte he syghed sore; ‘Take vp the table,’ anone he bad, ‘For I may eate no more.’ 143 The kyng called hys best archars, To the buttes with hym to go; ‘I wyll se these felowes shote,’ he sayd, ‘That in the north haue wrought this wo.’ 144 The kynges bowmen buske them blyue, And the quenes archers also, So dyd these thre wyght yemen, Wyth them they thought to go. 145 There twyse or thryse they shote about, For to assay theyr hande; There was no shote these thre yemen shot That any prycke might them stand. 146 Then spake Wyllyam of Cloudesle; By God that for me dyed, I hold hym neuer no good archar That shuteth at buttes so wyde. 147 ‘Wherat?’ then sayd our kyng, ‘I pray thee tell me:’ ‘At suche a but, syr,’ he sayd, ‘As men vse in my countree.’ 148 Wyllyam wente into a fyeld, And his to brothren with him; There they set vp to hasell roddes, Twenty score paces betwene. 149 ‘I hold him an archar,’ said Cloudesle, ‘That yonder wande cleueth in two:’ ‘Here is none suche,’ sayd the kyng, ‘Nor none that can so do.’ 150 ‘I shall assaye, syr,’ sayd Cloudesle, ‘Or that I farther go:’ Cloudesle, with a bearyng arow, Claue the wand in to. 151 ‘Thou art the best archer,’ then said the king, ‘Forsothe that euer I se:’ ‘And yet for your loue,’ sayd Wylliam, ‘I wyll do more maystry. 152 ‘I haue a sonne is seuen yere olde; He is to me full deare; I wyll hym tye to a stake, All shall se that be here; 153 ‘And lay an apple vpon hys head, And go syxe score paces hym fro, And I my selfe, with a brode arow, Shall cleue the apple in two.’ 154 ‘Now hast the,’ then sayd the kyng; ‘By him that dyed on a tre, But yf thou do not as thou hest sayde, Hanged shalt thou be. 155 ‘And thou touche his head or gowne, In syght that men may se, By all the sayntes that be in heaven, I shall hange you all thre.’ 156 ‘That I haue promised,’ said William, ‘I wyl it neuer forsake;’ And there euen before the kynge, In the earth he droue a stake; 157 And bound therto his eldest sonne, And bad hym stande styll therat, And turned the childes face fro him, Because he shuld not sterte. 158 An apple vpon his head he set, And then his bowe he bent; Syxe score paces they were outmet, And thether Cloudesle went. 159 There he drew out a fayr brode arrowe; Hys bowe was great and longe; He set that arrowe in his bowe, That was both styffe and stronge. 160 He prayed the people that was there That they would styll stande; ‘For he that shooteth for such a wager, Behoueth a stedfast hand.’ 161 Muche people prayed for Cloudesle, That hys lyfe saued myght be, And whan he made hym redy to shote, There was many a wepynge eye. 162 Thus Clowdesle clefte the apple in two, That many a man it se; ‘Ouer goddes forbode,’ sayd the kynge, ‘That thou sholdest shote at me! 163 ‘I gyue the .xviii. pens a daye, And my bowe shalte thou bere, And ouer all the north countree I make the chefe rydere.’ 164 ‘And I gyue the .xii. pens a day,’ sayd the que[ne], ‘By God and by my faye; Come fetche thy payment whan thou wylt, No man shall say the naye. 165 ‘Wyllyam, I make the gentylman Of clothynge and of fee, And thy two brethren yemen of my chambr[e], For they are so semely to se. 166 ‘Your sone, for he is tendre of age, Of my wyne-seller shall he be, And whan he commeth to mannës state, Better auaunced shall he be. 167 ‘And, Wylliam, brynge me your wyfe,’ sayd th[e quene]; Me longeth sore here to se; She shall be my chefe gentylwoman, And gouerne my nursery.’ 168 The yemen thanked them full courteysly, And sayd, To Rome streyght wyll we wende, [Of all the synnes that we haue done To be assoyled of his hand. 169 So forth]e be gone these good yemen, [As fast a]s they myght hye, [And aft]er came and dwelled with the kynge, [And dye]d good men all thre. 170 [Thus e]ndeth the lyues of these good yemen, [God sen]de them eternall blysse, [And all] that with hande-bowe shoteth, [That of] heuen they may neuer mysse! 117 A GEST OF ROBYN HODE A GEST OF ROBYN HODE a. ‘A Gest of Robyn Hode,’ without printer's name, date, or place;

THE FIRST FYTTE 1 Lythe and listin, gentilmen, That be of frebore blode; I shall you tel of a gode yeman, His name was Robyn Hode. 2 Robyn was a prude outlaw, [Whyles he walked on grounde; So curteyse an outlawe] as he was one Was never non founde. 3 Robyn stode in Bernesdale, And lenyd hym to a tre; And bi hym stode Litell Johnn, A gode yeman was he. 4 And alsoo dyd gode Scarlok, And Much, the miller's son; There was none ynch of his bodi But it was worth a grome. 5 Than bespake Lytell Johnn All vntoo Robyn Hode: Maister, and ye wolde dyne betyme It wolde doo you moche gode. 6 Than bespake hym gode Robyn: To dyne haue I noo lust, Till that I haue som bolde baron, Or som vnkouth gest. 7 That may pay for the best, Or som knyght or [som] squyer, That dwelleth here bi west. 8 A gode maner than had Robyn; In londe where that he were, Euery day or he wold dyne Thre messis wolde he here. 9 The one in the worship of the Fader, And another of the Holy Gost, The thirde of Our dere Lady, That he loued allther moste. 10 Robyn loued Oure derë Lady; For dout of dydly synne, Wolde he neuer do compani harme That any woman was in. 11 ‘Maistar,’ than sayde Lytil Johnn, ‘And we our borde shal sprede, Tell vs wheder that we shal go, And what life that we shall lede. 12 ‘Where we shall take, where we shall leue, Where we shall abide behynde; Where we shall robbe, where we shal reue, Where we shal bete and bynde.’ 13 ‘Therof no force,’ than sayde Robyn; ‘We shall do well inowe; But loke ye do no husbonde harme, That tilleth with his ploughe. 14 ‘No more ye shall no gode yeman That walketh by grenë-wode shawe; Ne no knyght ne no squyer That wol be a gode felawe. 15 ‘These bisshoppes and these archebishoppes, Ye shall them bete and bynde; The hyë sherif of Notyingham, Hym holde ye in your mynde.’ 16 ‘This worde shalbe holde,’ sayde Lytell Johnn, ‘And this lesson we shall lere; It is fer dayes; God sende vs a gest, That we were at oure dynere!’ 17 ‘Take thy gode bowe in thy honde,’ sayde Rob[yn]; ‘Late Much wende with the; And so shal Willyam Scarlo[k], And no man abyde with me. 18 ‘And walke vp to the Saylis, And so to Watlinge Stret[e], And wayte after some vnkuth gest, Vp chaunce ye may them mete. 19 ‘Be he erle, or ani baron, Abbot, or ani knyght, Bringhe hym to lodge to me; His dyner shall be dight.’ 20 They wente vp to the Saylis, These yeman all thre; They loked est, they loke[d] weest; They myght no man see. 21 But as they loked in to Bernysdale, Bi a dernë strete, Than came a knyght ridinghe; Full sone they gan hym mete. 22 All dreri was his semblaunce, And lytell was his pryde; His one fote in the styrop stode, That othere wauyd beside. 23 His hode hanged in his iyn two; He rode in symple aray; A soriar man than he was one Rode neuer in somer day. 24 Litell Johnn was full curteyes, And sette hym on his kne: ‘Welcom be ye, gentyll knyght, Welcom ar ye to me. 25 ‘Welcom be thou to grenë wode, Hendë knyght and fre; My maister hath abiden you fastinge, Syr, al these ourës thre.’ 26 ‘Who is thy maister?’ sayde the knyght; Johnn sayde, Robyn Hode; ‘He is [a] gode yoman,’ sayde the knyght, ‘Of hym I haue herde moche gode. 27 ‘I graunte,’ he sayde, ‘with you to wende, My bretherne, all in fere; My purpos was to haue dyned to day At Blith or Dancastere.’ 28 Furth than went this gentyl knight, With a carefull chere; The teris oute of his iyen ran, And fell downe by his lere. 29 They brought hym to the lodgë-dore; Whan Robyn hym gan see, Full curtesly dyd of his hode And sette hym on his knee. 30 ‘Welcome, sir knight,’ than sayde Robyn, ‘Welcome art thou to me; I haue abyden you fastinge, sir, All these ouris thre.’ 31 Than answered the gentyll knight, With wordës fayre and fre; God the saue, goode Robyn, And all thy fayre meynë. 32 They wasshed togeder and wyped bothe, And sette to theyr dynere; Brede and wyne they had right ynoughe, And noumbles of the dere. 33 Swannes and fessauntes they had full gode, And foules of the ryuere; There fayled none so litell a birde That euer was bred on bryre. 34 ‘Do gladly, sir knight,’ sayde Robyn; ‘Gramarcy, sir,’ sayde he; ‘Suche a dinere had I nat Of all these wekys thre. 35 ‘If I come ageyne, Robyn, Here by thys contrë, As gode a dyner I shall the make As that thou haest made to me.’ 36 ‘Gramarcy, knyght,’ sayde Robyn; ‘My dyner whan that I it haue, I was neuer so gredy, bi dere worthy God, My dyner for to craue. 37 ‘But pay or ye wende,’ sayde Robyn; ‘Me thynketh it is gode ryght; It was neuer the maner, by dere worthi God, A yoman to pay for a knyhht.’ 38 ‘I haue nought in my coffers,’ saide the knyght, ‘That I may profer for shame:’ ‘Litell Johnn, go loke,’ sayde Robyn, ‘Ne let nat for no blame. 39 ‘Tel me truth,’ than saide Robyn, ‘So God haue parte of the:’ ‘I haue no more but ten shelynges,’ sayde the knyght, ‘So God haue parte of me.’ 40 If thou hast no more,' sayde Robyn, ‘I woll nat one peny; And yf thou haue nede of any more, More shall I lend the. 41 ‘Go nowe furth, Littell Johnn, The truth tell thou me; If there be no more but ten shelinges, No peny that I se.’ 42 Lyttell Johnn sprede downe hys mantell Full fayre vpon the grounde, And there he fonde in the knyghtës cofer But euen halfe [a] pounde. 43 Littell Johnn let it lye full styll, And went to hys maysteer [full] lowe; ‘What tidyngës, Johnn?’ sayde Robyn; ‘Sir, the knyght is true inowe.’ 44 ‘Fyll of the best wine,’ sayde Robyn, ‘The knyght shall begynne; Moche wonder thinketh me Thy clot[h]ynge is so thin[n]e. 45 ‘Tell me [one] worde,’ sayde Robyn, ‘And counsel shal it be; I trowe thou warte made a knyght of force, Or ellys of yemanry. 46 ‘Or ellys thou hast bene a sori husbande, And lyued in stroke and stryfe; An okerer, or ellis a lechoure,’ sayde Robyn, ‘Wyth wronge hast led thy lyfe.’ 47 ‘I am none of those,’ sayde the knyght, ‘By God that madë me; An hundred wynter here before Myn auncetres knyghtes haue be. 48 ‘But oft it hath befal, Robyn, A man hath be disgrate; But God that sitteth in heuen aboue May amende his state. 49 ‘Withyn this two yere, Robyne,’ he sayde, ‘My neghbours well it knowe, Foure hundred pounde of gode money Ful well than myght I spende. 50 ‘Nowe haue I no gode,’ saide the knyght, ‘God hath shaped such an ende, But my chyldren and my wyfe, Tyll God yt may amende.’ 51 ‘In what maner,’ than sayde Robyn, ‘Hast thou lorne thy rychesse?’ ‘For my greatë foly,’ he sayde, ‘And for my kynd[ë]nesse. 52 ‘I hade a sone, forsoth, Robyn, That shulde hau[e] ben myn ayre, Whanne he was twenty wynter olde, In felde wolde iust full fayre. 53 ‘He slewe a knyght of Lancaster, And a squyer bolde; For to saue hym in his ryght My godes both sette and solde. 54 ‘My londes both sette to wedde, Robyn, Vntyll a certayn day, To a ryche abbot here besyde Of Seynt Mari Abbey.’ 55 ‘What is the som?’ sayde Robyn; ‘Trouth than tell thou me;’ ‘Sir,’ he sayde, ‘foure hundred pounde; The abbot told it to me.’ 56 ‘Nowe and thou lese thy lond,’ sayde Robyn, ‘What woll fall of the?’ ‘Hastely I wol me buske,’ sayd the knyght, ‘Ouer the saltë see, 57 ‘And se w[h]ere Criste was quyke and dede, On the mount of Caluerë; Fare wel, frende, and haue gode day; It may no better be.’ 58 Teris fell out of hys iyen two; He wolde haue gone hys way: ‘Farewel, frende, and haue gode day; I ne haue no more to pay.’ 59 ‘Where be thy frendës?’ sayde Robyn: ‘Syr, neuer one wol me knowe; While I was ryche ynowe at home Great boste than wolde they blowe. 60 ‘And nowe they renne away fro me, As bestis on a rowe; They take no more hede of me Thanne they had me neuer sawe.’ 61 For ruthe thanne wept Litell Johnn, Scarlok and Muche in fere; ‘Fyl of the best wyne,’ sayde Robyn, ‘For here is a symple chere. 62 ‘Hast thou any frende,’ sayde Robyn, ‘Thy borowe that woldë be?’ ‘I haue none,’ than sayde the knyght, ‘But God that dyed on tree.’ 63 ‘Do away thy iapis,’ than sayde Robyn, ‘Thereof wol I right none; Wenest thou I wolde haue God to borowe, Peter, Poule, or Johnn? 64 ‘Nay, by hym that me made, And shope both sonne and mone, Fynde me a better borowe,’ sayde Robyn, ‘Or money getest thou none.’ 65 ‘I haue none other,’ sayde the knyght, ‘The sothe for to say, But yf yt be Our derë Lady; She fayled me neuer or thys day.’ 66 ‘By dere worthy God,’ sayde Robyn, ‘To seche all Englonde thorowe, Yet fonde I neuer to my pay A moche better borowe. 67 ‘Come nowe furth, Litell Johnn, And go to my tresourë, And bringe me foure hundered pound, And loke well tolde it be.’ 68 Furth than went Litell Johnn, And Scarlok went before; He tolde oute foure hundred pounde By eight and twenty score. 69 ‘Is thys well tolde?’ sayde [litell] Much; Johnn sayde, ‘What gre[ue]th the? It is almus to helpe a gentyll knyght, That is fal in pouertë. 70 ‘Master,’ than sayde Lityll John, ‘His clothinge is full thynne; Ye must gyue the knight a lyueray, To lappe his body therin. 71 ‘For ye haue scarlet and grene, mayster, And man[y] a riche aray; Ther is no marchaunt in mery Englond So ryche, I dare well say.’ 72 ‘Take hym thre yerdes of euery colour, And loke well mete that it be;’ Lytell Johnn toke none other mesure But his bowë-tree. 73 And at euery handfull that he met He lepëd footës three; ‘What deuyllës drapar,’ sayid litell Muche, ‘Thynkest thou for to be?’ 74 Scarlok stode full stil and loughe, And sayd, By God Almyght, Johnn may gyue hym gode mesure, For it costeth hym but lyght. 75 ‘Mayster,’ than said Litell Johnn To gentill Robyn Hode, ‘Ye must giue the knig[h]t a hors, To lede home this gode.’ 76 ‘Take hym a gray coursar,’ sayde Robyn, ‘And a saydle newe; He is Oure Ladye's messangere; God graunt that he be true.’ 77 ‘And a gode palfray,’ sayde lytell Much, ‘To mayntene hym in his right;’ ‘And a peyre of botës,’ sayde Scarlock, ‘For he is a gentyll knight.’ 78 ‘What shalt thou gyue hym, Litell John?’ said Robyn; ‘Sir, a peyre of gilt sporis clene, To pray for all this company; God bringe hym oute of tene.’ 79 ‘Whan shal mi day be,’ said the knight, ‘Sir, and your wyll be?’ ‘This day twelue moneth,’ saide Robyn, ‘Vnder this grenë-wode tre. 80 ‘It were greate shamë,’ sayde Robyn, ‘A knight alone to ryde, Withoutë squyre, yoman, or page, To walkë by his syde. 81 ‘I shall the lende Litell John, my man, For he shalbe thy knaue; In a yema[n]'s stede he may the stande, If thou greate nedë haue.’ THE SECONDE FYTTE. 82 Now is the knight gone on his way; This game hym thought full gode; Whanne he loked on Bernesdale He blessyd Robyn Hode. 83 And whanne he thought on Bernysdale, On Scarlok, Much, and Johnn, He blyssyd them for the best company That euer he in come. 84 Then spake that gentyll knyght, To Lytel Johan gan he saye, To-morrowe I must to Yorke toune, To Saynt Mary abbay. 85 And to the abbot of that place Foure hondred pounde I must pay; And but I be there vpon this nyght My londe is lost for ay. 86 The abbot sayd to his couent, There he stode on grounde, This day twelfe moneth came there a knyght And borowed foure hondred pounde. 87 [He borowed foure hondred pounde,] Upon all his londë fre; But he come this ylkë day Dysheryte shall he be. 88 ‘It is full erely,’ sayd the pryoure, ‘The day is not yet ferre gone; I had leuer to pay an hondred pounde, And lay downe anone. 89 ‘The knyght is ferre beyonde the see, In Englonde is his ryght, And suffreth honger and colde, And many a sory nyght. 90 ‘It were grete pytë,’ said the pryoure, ‘So to haue his londe; And ye be so lyght of your consyence, Ye do to hym moch wronge.’ 91 ‘Thou arte euer in my berde,’ sayd the abbot, ‘By God and Saynt Rycharde;’ With that cam in a fat-heded monke, The heygh selerer. 92 ‘He is dede or hanged,’ sayd the monke, ‘By God that bought me dere, And we shall haue to spende in this place Foure hondred pounde by yere.’ 93 The abbot and the hy selerer Stertë forthe full bolde, The [hye] iustyce of Englonde The abbot there dyde holde. 94 The hyë iustyce and many mo Had take in to they[r] honde Holy all the knyghtës det, To put that knyght to wronge. 95 They demed the knyght wonder sore, The abbot and his meynë: ‘But he come this ylkë day Dysheryte shall he be.’ 96 ‘He wyll not come yet,’ sayd the iustyce, ‘I dare well vndertake;’ But in sorowe tymë for them all The knyght came to the gate. 97 Than bespake that gentyll knyght Untyll his meynë: Now put on your symple wedes That ye brought fro the see. 98 [They put on their symple wedes,] They came to the gates anone; The porter was redy hymselfe, And welcomed them euerychone. 99 ‘Welcome, syr knyght,’ sayd the porter; ‘My lorde to mete is he, And so is many a gentyll man, For the loue of the.’ 100 The porter swore a full grete othe, ‘By God that madë me, Here be the best coresed hors That euer yet sawe I me. 101 ‘Lede them in to the stable,’ he sayd, ‘That eased myght they be;’ ‘They shall not come therin,’ sayd the knyght, ‘By God that dyed on a tre.’ 102 Lordës were to mete isette In that abbotes hall; The knyght went forth and kneled downe, And salued them grete and small. 103 ‘Do gladly, syr abbot,’ sayd the knyght, ‘I am come to holde my day:’ The fyrst word the abbot spake, ‘Hast thou brought my pay?’ 104 ‘Not one peny,’ sayd the knyght, ‘By God that maked me;’ ‘Thou art a shrewed dettour,’ sayd the abbot; ‘Syr iustyce, drynke to me. 105 ‘What doost thou here,’ sayd the abbot, ‘But thou haddest brought thy pay?’ ‘For God,’ than sayd the knyght, ‘To pray of a lenger daye.’ 106 ‘Thy daye is broke,’ sayd the iustyce, ‘Londe getest thou none:’ ‘Now, good syr iustyce, be my frende, And fende me of my fone!’ 107 ‘I am holde with the abbot,’ sayd the iustyce, ‘Both with cloth and fee:’ ‘Now, good syr sheryf, be my frende!’ ‘Nay, for God,’ sayd he. 108 ‘Now, good syr abbot, be my frende, For thy curteysë, And holde my londës in thy honde Tyll I haue made the gree! 109 ‘And I wyll be thy true seruaunte, And trewely seruë the, Tyl ye haue foure hondred pounde Of money good and free.’ 110 The abbot sware a full grete othe, ‘By God that dyed on a tree, Get the londe where thou may, For thou getest none of me.’ 111 ‘By dere worthy God,’ then sayd the knyght, ‘That all this worldë wrought, But I haue my londe agayne, Full dere it shall be bought. 112 ‘God, that was of a mayden borne, Leue vs well to spede! For it is good to assay a frende Or that a man haue nede.’ 113 The abbot lothely on hym gan loke, And vylaynesly hym gan call; ‘Out,’ he sayd, ‘thou falsë knyght, Spede the out of my hall!’ 114 ‘Thou lyest,’ then sayd the gentyll knyght, ‘Abbot, in thy hal; False knyght was I neuer, By God that made vs all.’ 115 Vp then stode that gentyll knyght, To the abbot sayd he, To suffre a knyght to knele so longe, Thou canst no curteysye. 116 In ioustës and in tournement Full ferre than haue I be, And put my selfe as ferre in prees As ony that euer I se. 117 ‘What wyll ye gyue more,’ sayd the iustice, ‘And the knyght shall make a releyse? And elles dare I safly swere Ye holde neuer your londe in pees.’ 118 ‘An hondred pounde,’ sayd the abbot; The justice sayd, Gyue hym two; ‘Nay, be God,’ sayd the knyght, ‘Yit gete ye it not so. 119 ‘Though ye wolde gyue a thousand more, Yet were ye neuer the nere; Shall there neuer be myn heyre Abbot, iustice, ne frere.’ 120 He stert hym to a borde anone, Tyll a table rounde, And there he shoke oute of a bagge Euen four hundred pound. 121 ‘Haue here thi golde, sir abbot,’ saide the knight, ‘Which that thou lentest me; Had thou ben curtes at my comynge, Rewarded shuldest thou haue be.’ 122 The abbot sat styll, and ete no more, For all his ryall fare; He cast his hede on his shulder, And fast began to stare. 123 ‘Take me my golde agayne,’ said the abbot, ‘Sir iustice, that I toke the:’ ‘Not a peni,’ said the iustice, ‘Bi Go[d, that dy]ed on tree.’ 124 ‘Sir [abbot, and ye me]n of lawe, Now haue I holde my daye; Now shall I haue my londe agayne, For ought that you can saye.’ 125 The knyght stert out of the dore, Awaye was all his care, And on he put his good clothynge, The other he lefte there. 126 He wente hym forth full mery syngynge, As men haue tolde in tale; His lady met hym at the gate, At home in Verysdale. 127 ‘Welcome, my lorde,’ sayd his lady; ‘Syr, lost is all your good?’ ‘Be mery, dame,’ sayd the knyght, ‘And pray for Robyn Hode, 128 ‘That euer his soulë be in blysse: He holpe me out of tene; Ne had be his kyndënesse, Beggers had we bene. 129 ‘The abbot and I accorded ben, He is serued of his pay; The god yoman lent it me, As I cam by the way.’ 130 This knight than dwelled fayre at home, The sothe for to saye, Tyll he had gete four hundred pound, Al redy for to pay. 131 He purueyed him an hundred bowes, The stryngës well ydyght, An hundred shefe of arowës gode, The hedys burneshed full bryght; 132 And euery arowe an ellë longe, With pecok wel idyght, Inocked all with whyte siluer; It was a semely syght. 133 He purueyed hym an [hondreth men], Well harness[ed in that stede], And hym selfe in that same sete, And clothed in whyte and rede. 134 He bare a launsgay in his honde, And a man ledde his male, And reden with a lyght songe Vnto Bernysdale. 135 But as he went at a brydge ther was a wrastelyng, And there taryed was he, And there was all the best yemen Of all the west countree. 136 A full fayre game there was vp set, A whyte bulle vp i-pyght, A grete courser, with sadle and brydil, With golde burnyssht full bryght. 137 A payre of gloues, a rede golde rynge, A pype of wyne, in fay; What man that bereth hym best i-wys The pryce shall bere away. 138 There was a yoman in that place, And best worthy was he, And for he was ferre and frembde bested, Slayne he shulde haue be. 139 The knight had ruthe of this yoman, In placë where he stode; He sayde that yoman shulde haue no harme, For loue of Robyn Hode. 140 The knyght presed in to the place, An hundreth folowed hym [free], With bowës bent and arowës sharpe, For to shende that companye. 141 They shulderd all and made hym rome, To wete what he wolde say; He toke the yeman bi the hande, And gaue hym al the play. 142 He gaue hym fyue marke for his wyne, There it lay on the molde, And bad it shulde be set a broche, Drynkë who so wolde. 143 Thus longe taried this gentyll knyght, Tyll that play was done; So longe abode Robyn fastinge, Thre hourës after the none.

They loked est, they loked west, They myght no man se. 213 But as [t]he[y] loked in Bernysdale, By the hyë waye, Than were they ware of two blacke monkes, Eche on a good palferay. 214 Then bespake Lytell Johan, To Much he gan say, I dare lay my lyfe to wedde, That [these] monkes haue brought our pay. 215 ‘Make glad chere,’ sayd Lytell Johan, ‘And frese your bowes of ewe, And loke your hertës be seker and sad, Your stryngës trusty and trewe. 216 ‘The monke hath two and fifty [men,] And seuen somers full stronge;

For God is holde a ryghtwys man, And so is his dame. 241 ‘Thou toldest with thyn ownë tonge, Thou may not say nay, How thou arte her seruaunt, And seruest her euery day. 242 ‘And thou art made her messengere, My money for to pay;

If there be no more but twenty marke, No peny that I se.’ 247 Lytell Johan spred his mantell downe, As he had done before, And he tolde out of the monkës male Eyght [hondred] pounde and more. 248 Lytell Johan let it lye full styll, And went to his mayster in hast; ‘Syr,’ he sayd, ‘the monke is trewe ynowe, Our Lady hath doubled your cast.’ 249 ‘I make myn avowe to God,’ sayd Robyn — ‘Monke, what tolde I the? — Our Lady is the trewest woman That euer yet founde I me. 250 ‘By dere worthy God,’ sayd Robyn, ‘To seche all Englond thorowe, Yet founde I neuer to my pay A moche better borowe. 251 ‘Fyll of the best wyne, and do hym drynke,’ sayd Robyn, ‘And grete well thy lady hende, And yf she haue nede to Robyn Hode, A frende she shall hym fynde. 252 ‘And yf she nedeth ony more syluer, Come thou agayne to me, And, by this token she hath me sent, She shall haue such thre.’ 253 The monke was goynge to London ward, There to holde grete mote, The knyght that rode so hye on hors, To brynge hym vnder fote. 254 ‘Whether be ye away?’ sayd Robyn: ‘Syr, to maners in this londe, Too reken with our reues, That haue done moch wronge.’ 255 ‘Come now forth, Lytell Johan, And harken to my tale;

FYTTE. 354 The kynge came to Notynghame, With knyghtës in grete araye, For to take that gentyll knyght And Robyn Hode, and yf he may. 355 He asked men of that countrë After Robyn Hode, And after that gentyll knyght, That was so bolde and stout. 356 Whan they had tolde hym the case Our kynge vnderstode ther tale, And seased in his honde The knyghtës londës all. 357 All the passe of Lancasshyre He went both ferre and nere, Tyll he came to Plomton Parke; He faylyd many of his dere. 358 There our kynge was wont to se Herdës many one, He coud vnneth fynde one dere, That bare ony good horne. 359 The kynge was wonder wroth withall, And swore by the Trynytë, ‘I wolde I had Robyn Hode, With eyen I myght hym se. 360 ‘And he that wolde smyte of the knyghtës hede, And brynge it to me, He shall haue the knyghtës londes, Syr Rycharde at the Le. 361 ‘I gyue it hym with my charter, And sele it [with] my honde, To haue and holde for euer more, In all mery Englonde.’ 362 Than bespake a fayre olde knyght, That was treue in his fay: A, my leegë lorde the kynge, One worde I shall you say. 363 There is no man in this countrë May haue the knyghtës londes, Whyle Robyn Hode may ryde or gone, And bere a bowe in his hondes, 364 That he ne shall lese his hede, That is the best ball in his hode: Giue it no man, my lorde the kynge, That ye wyll any good. 365 Half a yere dwelled our comly kynge In Notyngham, and well more; Coude he not here of Robyn Hode, In what countrë that he were. 366 But alway went good Robyn By halke and eke by hyll, And alway slewe the kyngës dere, And welt them at his wyll. 367 Than bespake a proude fostere, That stode by our kyngës kne: Yf ye wyll se good Robyn, Ye must do after me. 368 Take fyue of the best knyghtës That be in your lede, And walke downe by yon abbay, And gete you monkës wede. 369 And I wyll be your ledës-man, And lede you the way, And or ye come to Notyngham, Myn hede then dare I lay, 370 That ye shall mete with good Robyn, On lyue yf that he be; Or ye come to Notyngham, With eyen ye shall hym se. 371 Full hast[ë]ly our kynge was dyght, So were his knyghtës fyue, Euerych of them in monkës wede, And hasted them thyder blyve. 372 Our kynge was grete aboue his cole, A brode hat on his crowne, Ryght as he were abbot-lyke, They rode up in-to the towne. 373 Styf botës our kynge had on, Forsoth as I you say; He rode syngynge to grenë wode, The couent was clothed in graye. 374 His male-hors and his gretë somers Folowed our kynge behynde, Tyll they came to grenë wode, A myle vnder the lynde. 375 There they met with good Robyn, Stondynge on the waye, And so dyde many a bolde archere, For soth as I you say. 376 Robyn toke the kyngës hors, Hastëly in that stede, And sayd, Syr abbot, by your leue, A whyle ye must abyde. 377 ‘We be yemen of this foreste, Vnder the grenë-wode tre; We lyue by our kyngës dere, [Other shyft haue not wee.] 378 ‘And ye haue chyrches and rentës both, And gold full grete plentë; Gyue vs some of your spendynge, For saynt[ë] charytë.’ 379 Than bespake our cumly kynge, Anone than sayd he; I brought no more to grenë wode But forty pounde with me. 380 I haue layne at Notyngham This fourtynyght with our kynge, And spent I haue full moche good, On many a grete lordynge. 381 And I haue but forty pounde, No more than haue I me; But yf I had an hondred pounde, I wolde vouch it safe on the. 382 Robyn toke the forty pounde, And departed it in two partye; Halfendell he gaue his mery men, And bad them mery to be. 383 Full curteysly Robyn gan say; Syr, haue this for your spendyng; We shall mete another day; ‘Gramercy,’ than sayd our kynge. 384 ‘But well the greteth Edwarde, our kynge, And sent to the his seale, And byddeth the com to Notyngham, Both to mete and mele.’ 385 He toke out the brodë targe, And sone he lete hym se; Robyn coud his courteysy, And set hym on his kne. 386 ‘I loue no man in all the worlde So well as I do my kynge; Welcome is my lordës seale; And, monke, for thy tydynge, 387 ‘Syr abbot, for thy tydynges, To day thou shalt dyne with me, For the loue of my kynge, Under my trystell-tre.’ 388 Forth he lad our comly kynge, Full fayre by the honde; Many a dere there was slayne, And full fast dyghtande. 389 Robyn toke a full grete horne, And loude he gan blowe; Seuen score of wyght yonge men Came redy on a rowe. 390 All they kneled on theyr kne, Full fayre before Robyn: The kynge sayd hym selfe vntyll, And swore by Saynt Austyn, 391 ‘Here is a wonder semely syght; Me thynketh, by Goddës pyne, His men are more at his byddynge Then my men be at myn.’ 392 Full hast[ë]ly was theyr dyner idyght, And therto gan they gone; They serued our kynge with al theyr myght, Both Robyn and Lytell Johan. 393 Anone before our kynge was set The fattë venyson, The good whyte brede, the good rede wyne, And therto the fyne ale and browne. 394 ‘Make good chere,’ said Robyn, ‘Abbot, for charytë; And for this ylkë tydynge, Blyssed mote thou be. 395 ‘Now shalte thou se what lyfe we lede, Or thou hens wende; Than thou may enfourme our kynge, Whan ye togyder lende.’ 396 Up they stertë all in hast, Theyr bowës were smartly bent; Our kynge was neuer so sore agast, He wende to haue be shente. 397 Two yerdës there were vp set, Thereto gan they gange; By fyfty pase, our kynge sayd, The merkës were to longe. 398 On euery syde a rose-garlonde, They shot vnder the lyne: ‘Who so fayleth of the rose-garlonde,’ sayd Robyn, ‘His takyll he shall tyne, 399 ‘And yelde it to his mayster, Be it neuer so fyne; For no man wyll I spare, So drynke I ale or wyne: 400 ‘And bere a buffet on his hede, I-wys ryght all bare:’ And all that fell in Robyns lote, He smote them wonder sare. 401 Twyse Robyn shot aboute, And euer he cleued the wande, And so dyde good Gylberte With the Whytë Hande. 402 Lytell Johan and good Scathelocke, For nothynge wolde they spare; When they fayled of the garlonde, Robyn smote them full sore. 403 At the last shot that Robyn shot, For all his frendës fare, Yet he fayled of the garlonde Thre fyngers and mare. 404 Than bespake good Gylberte, And thus he gan say; ‘Mayster,’ he sayd, ‘your takyll is lost, Stande forth and take your pay.’ 405 ‘If it be so,’ sayd Robyn, ‘That may no better be, Syr abbot, I delyuer the myn arowe, I pray the, syr, serue thou me.’ 406 ‘It falleth not for myn ordre,’ sayd our kynge, ‘Robyn, by thy leue, For to smyte no good yeman, For doute I sholde hym greue.’ 407 ‘Smyte on boldely,’ sayd Robyn, ‘I giue the largë leue:’ Anone our kynge, with that worde, He folde vp his sleue, 408 And sych a buffet he gaue Robyn, To grounde he yede full nere: ‘I make myn avowe to God,’ sayd Robyn, ‘Thou arte a stalworthe frere. 409 ‘There is pith in thyn arme,’ sayd Robyn, ‘I trowe thou canst well shete:’ Thus our kynge and Robyn Hode Togeder gan they mete. 410 Robyn behelde our comly kynge Wystly in the face, So dyde Syr Rycharde at the Le, And kneled downe in that place. 411 And so dyde all the wylde outlawes, Whan they se them knele: ‘My lorde the kynge of Englonde, Now I knowe you well. 412 ‘Mercy then, Robyn,’ sayd our kynge, ‘Vnder your trystyll-tre, Of thy goodnesse and thy grace, For my men and me!’ 413 ‘Yes, for God,’ sayd Robyn, ‘And also God me saue, I askë mercy, my lorde the kynge, And for my men I craue.’ 414 ‘Yes, for God,’ than sayd our kynge, ‘And therto sent I me, With that thou leue the grenë wode, And all thy company;

Ffor this day thou art my bale, My boote when thou shold bee!’ 17 This shoote it was but looselye shott, The arrowe flew in vaine, And it mett one of the sheriffes men; Good William a Trent was slaine. 18 It had beene better for William a Trent To hange vpon a gallowe Then for to lye in the greenwoode, There slaine with an arrowe. 19 And it is sayd, when men be mett, Six can doe more then three: And they haue tane Litle Iohn, And bound him ffast to a tree. 20 ‘Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe,’ quoth the sheriffe, ‘And hanged hye on a hill:’ ‘But thou may ffayle,’ quoth Litle Iohn, ‘If itt be Christs owne will.’ 21 Let vs leaue talking of Litle Iohn, For hee is bound fast to a tree, And talke of Guy and Robin Hood, In the green woode where they bee. 22 How these two yeomen together they mett, Vnder the leaues of lyne, To see what marchandise they made Euen at that same time. 23 ‘Good morrow, good fellow,’ quoth Sir Guy; ‘Good morrow, good ffellow,’ quoth hee; ‘Methinkes by this bow thou beares in thy hand, A good archer thou seems to bee.’ 24 ‘I am wilfull of my way,’ quoth Sir Guye, ‘And of my morning tyde:’ ‘I'le lead thee through the wood,’ quoth Robin, ‘Good ffellow, I'le be thy guide.’ 25 ‘I seeke an outlaw,’ quoth Sir Guye, ‘Men call him Robin Hood; I had rather meet with him vpon a day Then forty pound of golde.’ 26 ‘If you tow mett, itt wold be seene whether were better Afore yee did part awaye; Let vs some other pastime find, Good ffellow, I thee pray. 27 ‘Let vs some other masteryes make, And wee will walke in the woods euen; Wee may chance mee[t] with Robin Hoode Att some vnsett steven.’ 28 They cutt them downe the summer shroggs Which grew both vnder a bryar, And sett them three score rood in twinn, To shoote the prickes full neare. 29 ‘Leade on, good ffellow,’ sayd Sir Guye, ‘Lead on, I doe bidd thee:’ ‘Nay, by my faith,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘The leader thou shalt bee.’ 30 The first good shoot that Robin ledd Did not shoote an inch the pricke ffroe; Guy was an archer good enoughe, But he cold neere shoote soe. 31 The second shoote Sir Guy shott, He shott within the garlande; But Robin Hoode shott it better then hee, For he cloue the good pricke-wande. 32 ‘Gods blessing on thy heart!’ sayes Guye, ‘Goode ffellow, thy shooting is goode; For an thy hart be as good as thy hands, Thou were better then Robin Hood. 33 ‘Tell me thy name, good ffellow,’ quoth Guy, ‘Vnder the leaues of lyne:’ ‘Nay, by my faith,’ quoth good Robin, ‘Till thou haue told me thine.’ 34 ‘I dwell by dale and downe,’ quoth Guye, ‘And I haue done many a curst turne; And he that calles me by my right name Calles me Guye of good Gysborne.’ 35 ‘My dwelling is in the wood,’ sayes Robin; ‘By thee I set right nought; My name is Robin Hood of Barnesdale, A ffellow thou has long sought.’ 36 He that had neither beene a kithe nor kin Might haue seene a full fayre sight, To see how together these yeomen went, With blades both browne and bright. 37 To haue seene how these yeomen together foug[ht], Two howers of a summers day; Itt was neither Guy nor Robin Hood That ffettled them to flye away. 38 Robin was reacheles on a roote, And stumbled at that tyde, And Guy was quicke and nimble with-all, And hitt him ore the left side. 39 ‘Ah, deere Lady!’ sayd Robin Hoode, ‘Thou art both mother and may! I thinke it was neuer mans destinye To dye before his day.’ 40 Robin thought on Our Lady deere, And soone leapt vp againe, And thus he came with an awkwarde stroke; Good Sir Guy hee has slayne. 41 He tooke Sir Guys head by the hayre, And sticked itt on his bowes end: ‘Thou hast beene traytor all thy liffe, Which thing must haue an ende.’ 42 Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe, And nicked Sir Guy in the fface, That hee was neuer on a woman borne Cold tell who Sir Guye was. 43 Saies, Lye there, lye there, good Sir Guye, And with me be not wrothe; If thou haue had the worse stroakes at my hand, Thou shalt haue the better cloathe. 44 Robin did off his gowne of greene, Sir Guye hee did it throwe; And hee put on that capull-hyde, That cladd him topp to toe. 45 ‘The bowe, the arrowes, and litle horne, And with me now I'le beare; Ffor now I will goe to Barn[e]sdale, To see how my men doe ffare.’ 46 Robin sett Guyes horne to his mouth, A lowd blast in it he did blow; That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham, As he leaned vnder a lowe. 47 ‘Hearken! hearken!’ sayd the sheriffe, ‘I heard noe tydings but good; For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blowe, For he hath slaine Robin Hoode. 48 ‘For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blow, Itt blowes soe well in tyde, For yonder comes that wighty yeoman, Cladd in his capull-hyde. 49 ‘Come hither, thou good Sir Guy, Aske of mee what thou wilt haue:’ ‘I'le none of thy gold,’ sayes Robin Hood, ‘Nor I'le none of itt haue. 50 ‘But now I haue slaine the master,’ he sayd, ‘Let me goe strike the knaue; This is all the reward I aske, Nor noe other will I haue.’ 51 ‘Thou art a madman,’ said the shiriffe, ‘Thou sholdest haue had a knights ffee; Seeing thy asking [hath] beene soe badd, Well granted it shall be.’ 52 But Litle Iohn heard his master speake, Well he knew that was his steuen; ‘Now shall I be loset,’ quoth Litle Iohn, ‘With Christs might in heauen.’ 53 But Robin hee hyed him towards Litle Iohn, Hee thought hee wold loose him beliue; The sheriffe and all his companye Fast after him did driue. 54 ‘Stand abacke! stand abacke!’ sayd Robin; ‘Why draw you mee soe neere? Itt was neuer the vse in our countrye One's shrift another shold heere.’ 55 But Robin pulled forth an Irysh kniffe, And losed Iohn hand and ffoote, And gaue him Sir Guyes bow in his hand, And bade it be his boote. 56 But Iohn tooke Guyes bow in his hand — His arrowes were rawstye by the roote —; The sherriffe saw Litle Iohn draw a bow And ffettle him to shoote. 57 Towards his house in Nottingam He ffled full fast away, And soe did all his companye, Not one behind did stay. 58 But he cold neither soe fast goe, Nor away soe fast runn, But Litle Iohn, with an arrow broade, Did cleaue his heart in twinn. 119 ROBIN HOOD AND THE MONK ROBIN HOOD AND THE MONK a.

And pearct the vaine, and let out the bloode, That full red was to see. 17 And first it bled, the thicke, thicke bloode, And afterwards the thinne, And well then wist good Robin Hoode Treason there was within. 18 ‘What cheere my master?’ said Litle Iohn; ‘In faith, Iohn, litle goode;’ 19 ‘I haue upon a gowne of greene, Is cut short by my knee, And in my hand a bright browne brand That will well bite of thee.’ 20 But forth then of a shot-windowe Good Robin Hood he could glide; Red Roger, with a grounden glaue, Thrust him through the milke-white side. 21 But Robin was light and nimble of foote, And thought to abate his pride, Ffor betwixt his head and his shoulders He made a wound full wide. 22 Says, Ly there, ly there, Red Roger, The doggs they must thee eate; ‘For I may haue my houzle,’ he said, ‘For I may both goe and speake. 23 ‘Now giue me mood,’ Robin said to Litle Iohn, ‘Giue me mood with thy hand; I trust to God in heauen soe hye My houzle will me bestand.’ 24 ‘Now giue me leaue, giue me leaue, master,’ he said, ‘For Christs loue giue leaue to me, To set a fier within this hall, And to burne vp all Churchlee.’ 25 ‘That I reade not,’ said Robin Hoode then, ‘Litle Iohn, for it may not be; If I shold doe any widow hurt, at my latter end, God,’ he said, ‘wold blame me; 26 ‘But take me vpon thy backe, Litle Iohn, And beare me to yonder streete, And there make me a full fayre graue, Of grauell and of greete. 27 ‘And sett my bright sword at my head, Mine arrowes at my feete, And lay my vew-bow by my side, My met-yard wi Robin Hood's Death and Burial ROBIN HOOD'S DEATH—B a.

Hey, etc. 2 But I am not able to shoot one shot more, My broad arrows will not flee; But I have a cousin lives down below, Please God, she will bleed me. 3 Now Robin he is to fair Kirkly gone, As fast as he can win; But before he came there, as we do hear, He was taken very ill. 4 And when he came to fair Kirkly-hall, He knockd all at the ring, But none was so ready as his cousin herself For to let bold Robin in. 5 ‘Will you please to sit down, cousin Robin,’ she said, ‘And drink some beer with me?’ ‘No, I will neither eat nor drink, Till I am blooded by thee.’ 6 ‘Well, I have a room, cousin Robin,’ she said, ‘Which you did never see, And if you please to walk therein, You blooded by me shall be.’ 7 She took him by the lily-white hand, And led him to a private room, And there she blooded bold Robin Hood, While one drop of blood would run down. 8 She blooded him in a vein of the arm, And locked him up in the room; Then did he bleed all the live-long day, Until the next day at noon. 9 He then bethought him of a casement there, Thinking for to get down; But was so weak he could not leap, He could not get him down. 10 He then bethought him of his bugle-horn, Which hung low down to his knee; He set his horn unto his mouth, And blew out weak blasts three. 11 Then Little John, when hearing him, As he sat under a tree, ‘I fear my master is now near dead, He blows so wearily.’ 12 Then Little John to fair Kirkly is gone, As fast as he can dree; But when he came to Kirkly-hall, He broke locks two or three: 13 Until he came bold Robin to see, Then he fell on his knee; ‘A boon, a boon,’ cries Little John, ‘Master, I beg of thee.’ 14 ‘What is that boon,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Little John, [thou] begs of me?’ ‘It is to burn fair Kirkly-hall, And all their nunnery.’ 15 ‘Now nay, now nay,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘That boon I'll not grant thee; I never hurt woman in all my life, Nor men in woman's company. 16 ‘I never hurt fair maid in all my time, Nor at mine end shall it be; But give me my bent bow in my hand, And a broad arrow I'll let flee; And where this arrow is taken up, There shall my grave digged be. 17 ‘Lay me a green sod under my head, And another at my feet; And lay my bent bow by my side, Which was my music sweet; And make my grave of gravel and green, Which is most right and meet. 18 ‘Let me have length and breadth enough, With a green sod under my head; That they may say, when I am dead Here lies bold Robin Hood.’ 19 These words they readily granted him, Which did bold Robin please: And there they buried bold Robin Hood, Within the fair Kirkleys. 121 ROBIN HOOD AND THE POTTER ROBIN HOOD AND THE POTTER Library of the University of Cambridge, MS.

They be fat and fair for to see;’ ‘I tell thee, good fellow, I would I were gone, For I like not thy company.’ 26 Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth, And blew but blasts three; Then quickly anon there came Little John, And all his company. 27 ‘What is your will?’ then said Little John, ‘Good master come tell it to me; ‘I have brought hither the sheriff of Notingham, This day to dine with thee.’ 28 ‘He is welcome to me,’ then said Little John, ‘I hope he will honestly pay; I know he has gold, if it be but well told, Will serve us to drink a whole day.’ 29 Then Robin took his mantle from his back, And laid it upon the ground, And out of the sheriffe['s] portmantle He told three hundred pound. 30 Then Robin he brought him thorow the wood, And set him on his dapple gray: ‘O have me commended to your wife at home;’ So Robin went laughing away. 123 ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTAL FRIAR Robine Hood and Ffryer Tucke ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTAL FRIAR—A Percy MS., p. 10; Hales and Furnivall, I, 26. 1 But how many merry monthes be in the yeere? There are thirteen, I say; The midsummer moone is the merryest of all, Next to the merry month of May. 2 In May, when mayds beene fast weepand, Young men their hands done wringe, 3 ‘I'le pe Over may noe man for villanie:’ ‘I'le never eate nor drinke,’ Robin Hood sa[id], ‘Till I that cutted friar see.’ 4 He builded his men in a brake of fearne, A litle from that nunery; Sayes, If you heare my litle horne blow, Then looke you come to me. 5 When Robin came to Fontaines Abey, Wheras that fryer lay, He was ware of the fryer where he stood, And to him thus can he say. 6 A payre of blacke breeches the yeoman had on, His coppe all shone of steele, A fayre sword and a broad buckeler Beseemed him very weell. 7 ‘I am a wet weary man,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Good fellow, as thou may see; Wilt beare [me] over this wild water, Ffor sweete Saint Charity?’ 8 The fryer bethought him of a good deed; He had done none of long before; He hent up Robin Hood on his backe, And over he did him beare. 9 But when he came over that wild water, A longe sword there he drew: ‘Beare me backe againe, bold outlawe, Or of this thou shalt have enoughe.’ 10 Then Robin Hood hent the fryar on his back, And neither sayd good nor ill; Till he came ore that wild water, The yeoman he walked still. 11 Then Robin Hood wett his fayre greene hoze, A span aboue his knee; S[ay]s, Beare me ore againe, thou cutted f[ryer] 12 good bowmen [C]ame raking all on a rowe. 13 ‘I beshrew thy head,’ said the cutted ffriar, ‘Thou thinkes I shall be shente; I thought thou had but a man or two, And thou hast [a] whole conuent. 14 ‘I lett thee haue a blast on thy horne, Now giue me leaue to whistle another; I cold not bidd thee noe better play And thou wert my owne borne brother.’ 15 ‘Now fute on, fute on, thou cutted fryar, I pray God thou neere be still; It is not the futing in a fryers fist That can doe me any ill.’ 16 The fryar sett his neave to his mouth, A loud blast he did blow; Then halfe a hundred good bandoggs Came raking all on a rowe. 17 ‘Euery dogg to a man,’ said the cutted fryar, ‘And I my selfe to Robin Hood.’ 18 ‘Over God's forbott,’ said Robin Hood, ‘That euer that soe shold bee; I had rather be mached with three of the tikes Ere I wold be matched on thee. 19 ‘But stay thy tikes, thou fryar,’ he said, ‘And freindshipp I'le haue with thee; But stay thy tikes, thou fryar,’ he said, ‘And saue good yeomanry.’ 20 The fryar he sett his neave to his mouth, A lowd blast he did blow; The doggs the coucht downe euery one, They couched downe on a rowe. 21 ‘What is thy will, thou yeoman?’ he said, ‘Haue done and tell it me;’ ‘If that thou will goe to merry greenwood, The Famous Battel between Robin Hood and the Curtal Fryer ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTAL FRIAR—B a.

Or who can kill a do? Or who can kill a hart of greece, Five hundred foot him fro?’ 4 Will Scadlock he killd a buck, And Midge he killd a do, And Little John killd a hart of greece, Five hundred foot him fro. 5 ‘God's blessing on thy heart,’ said Robin Hood, ‘That hath [shot] such a shot for me; I would ride my horse an hundred miles, To finde one could match with thee.’ 6 That causd Will Scadlock to laugh, He laughed full heartily: ‘There lives a curtal frier in Fountains Abby Will beat both him and thee. 7 ‘That curtal frier in Fountains Abby Well can a strong bow draw; He will beat you and your yeomen, Set them all on a row.’ 8 Robin Hood took a solemn oath, It was by Mary free, That he would neither eat nor drink Till the frier he did see. 9 Robin Hood put on his harness good, And on his head a cap of steel, Broad sword and buckler by his side, And they became him weel. 10 He took his bow into his hand, It was made of a trusty tree, With a sheaf of arrows at his belt, To the Fountains Dale went he. 11 And comming unto Fountain[s] Dale, No further would he ride; There was he aware of a curtal frier, Walking by the water-side. 12 The fryer had on a harniss good, And on his head a cap of steel, Broad sword and buckler by his side, And they became him weel. 13 Robin Hood lighted off his horse, And tied him to a thorn: ‘Carry me over the water, thou curtal frier, Or else thy life's forlorn.’ 14 The frier took Robin Hood on his back, Deep water he did bestride, And spake neither good word nor bad, Till he came at the other side. 15 Lightly leapt Robin Hood off the friers back; The frier said to him again, Carry me over this water, fine fellow, Or it shall breed thy pain. 16 Robin Hood took the frier on's back, Deep water he did bestride, And spake neither good word nor bad, Till he came at the other side. 17 Lightly leapt the fryer off Robin Hoods back; Robin Hood said to him again, Carry me over this water, thou curtal frier, Or it shall breed thy pain. 18 The frier took Robin Hood on's back again, And stept up to the knee; Till he came at the middle stream, Neither good nor bad spake he. 19 And coming to the middle stream, There he threw Robin in: ‘And chuse thee, chuse thee, fine fellow, Whether thou wilt sink or swim.’ 20 Robin Hood swam to a bush of broom, The frier to a wicker wand; Bold Robin Hood is gone to shore, And took his bow in hand. 21 One of his best arrows under his belt To the frier he let flye; The curtal frier, with his steel buckler, He put that arrow by. 22 ‘Shoot on, shoot on, thou fine fellow, Shoot on as thou hast begun; If thou shoot here a summers day, Thy mark I will not shun.’ 23 Robin Hood shot passing well, Till his arrows all were gone; They took their swords and steel bucklers, And fought with might and maine; 24 From ten oth' clock that day, Till four ith' afternoon; Then Robin Hood came to his knees, Of the frier to beg a boon. 25 ‘A boon, a boon, thou curtal frier, I beg it on my knee; Give me leave to set my horn to my mouth, And to blow blasts three.’ 26 ‘That will I do,’ said the curtal frier, ‘Of thy blasts I have no doubt; I hope thou'lt blow so passing well Till both thy eyes fall out.’ 27 Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth, He blew but blasts three; Half a hundred yeomen, with bows bent, Came raking over the lee. 28 ‘Whose men are these,’ said the frier, ‘That come so hastily?’ ‘These men are mine,’ said Robin Hood; ‘Frier, what is that to thee?’ 29 ‘A boon, a boon,’ said the curtal frier, ‘The like I gave to thee; Give me leave to set my fist to my mouth, And to whute whutes three.’ 30 ‘That will I do,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Or else I were to blame; Three whutes in a friers fist Would make me glad and fain.’ 31 The frier he set his fist to his mouth, And whuted whutes three; Half a hundred good ban-dogs Came running the frier unto. 32 ‘Here's for every man of thine a dog, And I my self for thee:’ ‘Nay, by my faith,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘Frier, that may not be.’ 33 Two dogs at once to Robin Hood did go, The one behind, the other before; Robin Hoods mantle of Lincoln green Off from his back they tore. 34 And whether his men shot east or west, Or they shot north or south, The curtal dogs, so taught they were, They kept their arrows in their mouth. 35 ‘Take up thy dogs,’ said Little John, ‘Frier, at my bidding be;’ ‘Whose man art thou,’ said the curtal frier, ‘Comes here to prate with me?’ 36 ‘I am Little John, Robin Hoods man, Frier, I will not lie; If thou take not up thy dogs soon, I'le take up them and thee.’ 37 Little John had a bow in his hand, He shot with might and main; Soon half a score of the friers dogs Lay dead upon the plain. 38 ‘Hold thy hand, good fellow,’ said the curtal frier, ‘Thy master and I will agree; And we will have new orders taken, With all the haste that may be.’ 39 ‘If thou wilt forsake fair Fountains Dale, And Fountains Abby free, Every Sunday throughout the year, A noble shall be thy fee. 40 ‘And every holy day throughout the year, Changed shall thy garment be, If thou wilt go to fair Nottingham, And there remain with me.’ 41 This curtal frier had kept Fountains Dale Seven long years or more; There was neither knight, lord, nor earl Could make him yield before. 124 THE JOLLY PINDER OF WAKEFIELD THE JOLLY PINDER OF WAKEFIELD—A a.

A Collection of Old Ballads, 1723, I, 75. b. Aldermary Garland, by R.Marshall, n. d., No 22. 1 When Robin Hood was about twenty years old, With a hey down down and a down He happend to meet Little John, A jolly brisk blade, right fit for the trade, For he was a lusty young man. 2 Tho he was calld Little, his limbs they were large, And his stature was seven foot high; Where-ever he came, they quak'd at his name, For soon he would make them to fly. 3 How they came acquainted, I'll tell you in brief, If you will but listen a while; For this very jest, amongst all the rest, I think it may cause you to smile. 4 Bold Robin Hood said to his jolly bowmen, Pray tarry you here in this grove; And see that you all observe well my call, While thorough the forest I rove. 5 We have had no sport for these fourteen long days, Therefore now abroad will I go; Now should I be beat, and cannot retreat, My horn I will presently blow. 6 Then did he shake hands with his merry men all, And bid them at present good b'w'ye; Then, as near a brook his journey he took, A stranger he chancd to espy. 7 They happend to meet on a long narrow bridge, And neither of them would give way; Quoth bold Robin Hood, and sturdily stood, I'll show you right Nottingham play. 8 With that from his quiver an arrow he drew, A broad arrow with a goose-wing: The stranger reply'd, I'll liquor thy hide, If thou offerst to touch the string. 9 Quoth bold Robin Hood, Thou dost prate like an ass, For were I to bend but my bow, I could send a dart quite thro thy proud heart, Before thou couldst strike me one blow. 10 ‘Thou talkst like a coward,’ the stranger reply'd; ‘Well armd with a long bow you stand, To shoot at my breast, while I, I protest, Have nought but a staff in my hand.’ 11 ‘The name of a coward,’ quoth Robin, ‘I scorn, Wherefore my long bow I'll lay by; And now, for thy sake, a staff will I take, The truth of thy manhood to try.’ 12 Then Robin Hood stept to a thicket of trees, And chose him a staff of ground-oak; Now this being done, away he did run To the stranger, and merrily spoke: 13 Lo! see my staff, it is lusty and tough, Now here on the bridge we will play; Whoever falls in, the other shall win The battel, and so we'll away. 14 ‘With all my whole heart,’ the stranger reply'd; ‘I scorn in the least to give out;’ This said, they fell to't without more dispute, And their staffs they did flourish about. 15 And first Robin he gave the stranger a bang, So hard that it made his bones ring: The stranger he said, This must be repaid, I'll give you as good as you bring. 16 So long as I'm able to handle my staff, To die in your debt, friend, I scorn: Then to it each goes, and followd their blows, As if they had been threshing of corn. 17 The stranger gave Robin a crack on the crown, Which caused the blood to appear; Then Robin, enrag'd, more fiercely engag'd, And followd his blows more severe. 18 So thick and so fast did he lay it on him, With a passionate fury and ire, At every stroke, he made him to smoke, As if he had been all on fire. 19 O then into fury the stranger he grew, And gave him a damnable look, And with it a blow that laid him full low, And tumbld him into the brook. 20 ‘I prithee, good fellow, O where art thou now?’ The stranger, in laughter, he cry'd; Quoth bold Robin Hood, Good faith, in the flood, And floating along with the tide. 21 I needs must acknowledge thou art a brave soul; With thee I'll no longer contend; For needs must I say, thou hast got the day, Our battel shall be at an end. 22 Then unto the bank he did presently wade, And pulld himself out by a thorn; Which done, at the last, he blowd a loud blast Straitway on his fine bugle-horn. 23 The eccho of which through the vallies did fly, At which his stout bowmen appeard, All cloathed in green, most gay to be seen; So up to their master they steerd. 24 ‘O what's the matter?’ quoth William Stutely; ‘Good master, you are wet to the skin:’ ‘No matter,’ quoth he; ‘the lad which you see, In fighting, hath tumbld me in.’ 25 ‘He shall not go scot-free,’ the others reply'd; So strait they were seizing him there, To duck him likewise; but Robin Hood cries, He is a stout fellow, forbear. 26 There's no one shall wrong thee, friend, be not afraid; These bowmen upon me do wait; There's threescore and nine; if thou wilt be mine, Thou shalt have my livery strait. 27 And other accoutrements fit for a man; Speak up, jolly blade, never fear; I'll teach you also the use of the bow, To shoot at the fat fallow-deer. 28 ‘O here is my hand,’ the stranger reply'd, ‘I'll serve you with all my whole heart; My name is John Little, a man of good mettle; Nere doubt me, for I'll play my part.’ 29 His name shall be alterd,’ quoth William Stutely, ‘And I will his godfather be; Prepare then a feast, and none of the least, For we will be merry,’ quoth he. 30 They presently fetchd in a brace of fat does, With humming strong liquor likewise; They lovd what was good; so, in the greenwood, This pretty sweet babe they baptize. 31 He was, I must tell you, but seven foot high, And, may be, an ell in the waste; A pretty sweet lad; much feasting they had; Bold Robin the christning grac'd. 32 With all his bowmen, which stood in a ring, And were of the Notti[n]gham breed; Brave Stutely comes then, with seven yeomen, And did in this manner proceed. 33 ‘This infant was called John Little,’ quoth he, ‘Which name shall be changed anon; The words we'll transpose, so where-ever he goes, His name shall be calld Little John.’ 34 They all with a shout made the elements ring, So soon as the office was ore; To feasting they went, with true merriment, And tippld strong liquor gillore. 35 Then Robin he took the pretty sweet babe, And cloathd him from top to the toe In garments of green, most gay to be seen, And gave him a curious long bow. 36 ‘Thou shalt be an archer as well as the best, And range in the greenwood with us; Where we'll not want gold nor silver, behold, While bishops have ought in their purse. 37 ‘We live here like squires, or lords of renown, Without ere a foot of free land; We feast on good cheer, with wine, ale, and beer, And evry thing at our command.’ 38 Then musick and dancing did finish the day; At length, when the sun waxed low, Then all the whole train the grove did refrain, And unto their caves they did go. 39 And so ever after, as long as he livd, Altho he was proper and tall, Yet nevertheless, the truth to express, Still Little John they did him call. 126 ROBIN HOOD AND THE TANNER ROBIN HOOD AND THE TANNER a.

In sooth, to be brief, thou lookst like a thief, That comes to steal our king's deer. 6 For I am a keeper in this forrest; The king puts me in trust To look to his deer, that range here and there, Therefore stay thee I must. 7 ‘If thou beest a keeper in this forrest, And hast such a great command, Yet thou must have more partakers in store, Before thou make me to stand.’ 8 ‘Nay, I have no more partakers in store, Or any that I do need; But I have a staff of another oke graff, I know it will do the deed.’ 9 ‘For thy sword and thy bow I care not a straw, Nor all thine arrows to boot; If I get a knop upon thy bare scop, Thou canst as well shite as shoote.’ 10 ‘Speak cleanly, good fellow,’ said jolly Robin, ‘And give better terms to me; Else I'le thee correct for thy neglect, And make thee more mannerly.’ 11 ‘Marry gep with a wenion!’ quoth Arthur a Bland, ‘Art thou such a goodly man? I care not a fig for thy looking so big; Mend thou thyself where thou can.’ 12 Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt, He laid down his bow so long; He took up a staff of another oke graff, That was both stiff and strong. 13 ‘I'le yield to thy weapon,’ said jolly Robin, ‘Since thou wilt not yield to mine; For I have a staff of another oke graff, Not half a foot longer then thine. 14 ‘But let me measure,’ said jolly Robin, ‘Before we begin our fray; For I'le not have mine to be longer then thine, For that will be called foul play.’ 15 ‘I pass not for length,’ bold Arthur reply'd, ‘My staff is of oke so free; Eight foot and a half, it will knock down a calf, And I hope it will knock down thee.’ 16 Then Robin Hood could no longer forbear; He gave him such a knock, Quickly and soon the blood came down, Before it was ten a clock. 17 Then Arthur he soon recovered himself, And gave him such a knock on the crown, That on every hair of bold Robin Hoods head, The blood came trickling down. 18 Then Robin Hood raged like a wild bore, As soon as he saw his own blood; Then Bland was in hast, he laid on so fast, As though he had been staking of wood. 19 And about, and about, and about they went, Like two wild bores in a chase; Striving to aim each other to maim, Leg, arm, or any other place. 20 And knock for knock they lustily dealt, Which held for two hours and more; That all the wood rang at every bang, They ply'd their work so sore. 21 ‘Hold thy hand, hold thy hand,’ said Robin Hood, ‘And let our quarrel fall; For here we may thresh our bones into mesh, And get no coyn at all. 22 ‘And in the forrest of merry Sherwood Hereafter thou shalt be free:’ ‘God-a-mercy for naught, my freedom I bought, I may thank my good staff, and not thee.’ 23 ‘What tradesman art thou?’ said jolly Robin, ‘Good fellow, I prethee me show: And also me tell in what place thou dost dwel, For both these fain would I know.’ 24 ‘I am a tanner,’ bold Arthur reply'd, ‘In Nottingham long have I wrought; And if thou'lt come there, I vow and do swear I will tan thy hide for naught.’ 25 ‘God a mercy, good fellow,’ said jolly Robin, ‘Since thou art so kind to me; And if thou wilt tan my hide for naught, I will do as much for thee. 26 ‘But if thou'lt forsake thy tanners trade, And live in green wood with me, My name's Robin Hood, I swear by the rood I will give thee both gold and fee.’ 27 ‘If thou be Robin Hood,’ bold Arthur reply'd, ‘As I think well thou art, Then here's my hand, my name's Arthur a Bland, We two will never depart. 28 ‘But tell me, O tell me, where is Little John? Of him fain would I hear; For we are alide by the mothers side, And he is my kinsman near.’ 29 Then Robin Hood blew on the beaugle horn, He blew full lowd and shrill, But quickly anon appeard Little John, Come tripping down a green hill. 30 ‘O what is the matter?’ then said Little John, ‘Master, I pray you tell; Why do you stand with your staff in your hand? I fear all is not well.’ 31 ‘O man, I do stand, and he makes me to stand, The tanner that stands thee beside; He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade, For soundly he hath tand my hide.’ 32 ‘He is to be commended,’ then said Little John, ‘If such a feat he can do; If he be so stout, we will have a bout, And he shall tan my hide too.’ 33 ‘Hold thy hand, hold thy hand,’ said Robin Hood, ‘For as I do understand, He's a yeoman good, and of thine own blood, For his name is Arthur a Bland.’ 34 Then Little John threw his staff away, As far as he could it fling, And ran out of hand to Arthur a Bland, And about his neck did cling. 35 With loving respect, there was no neglect, They were neither nice nor coy, Each other did face, with a lovely grace, And both did weep for joy. 36 Then Robin Hood took them both by the hand, And danc'd round about the oke tree; ‘For three merry men, and three merry men, And three merry men we be. 37 ‘And ever hereafter, as long as I live, We three will be all one; The wood shall ring, and the old wife sing, Of Robin Hood, Arthur, and John.’ 127 ROBIN HOOD AND THE TINKER ROBIN HOOD AND THE TINKER a.

Hey down a down a down 2 And as hee came to Nottingham A Tinker he did meet, And seeing him a lusty blade, He did him kindly greet. 3 ‘Where dost thou live?’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘I pray thee now mee tell; Sad news I hear there is abroad, I fear all is not well.’ 4 ‘What is that news?’ the Tinker said; ‘Tell mee without delay; I am a tinker by my trade, And do live at Banbura.’ 5 ‘As for the news,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘It is but as I hear; Two tinkers they were set ith' stocks, For drinking ale and bear.’ 6 ‘If that be all,’ the Tinker said, ‘As I may say to you, Your news it is not worth a fart, Since that they all bee true. 7 ‘For drinking of good ale and bear, You wil not lose your part:’ ‘No, by my faith,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘I love it with all my heart. 8 ‘What news abroad?’ quoth Robin Hood; ‘Tell mee what thou dost hear; Being thou goest from town to town, Some news thou need not fear.’ 9 ‘All the news,’ the Tinker said, ‘I hear, it is for good; It is to seek a bold outlaw, Which they call Robin Hood. 10 ‘I have a warrant from the king, To take him where I can; If you can tell me where hee is, I will make you a man. 11 ‘The king will give a hundred pound That hee could but him see; And if wee can but now him get, It will serve you and mee.’ 12 ‘Let me see that warrant,’ said Robin Hood; ‘I'le see if it bee right; And I will do the best I can For to take him this night.’ 13 ‘That will I not,’ the Tinker said; ‘None with it I will trust; And where hee is if you'l not tell, Take him by force I must.’ 14 But Robin Hood perceiving well How then the game would go, ‘If you will go to Nottingham, Wee shall find him I know.’ 15 The Tinker had a crab-tree staff, Which was both good and strong; Robin hee had a good strong blade, So they went both along. 16 And when they came to Nottingham, There they both tooke one inn; And they calld for ale and wine, To drink it was no sin. 17 But ale and wine they drank so fast That the Tinker hee forgot What thing he was about to do; It fell so to his lot 18 That while the Tinker fell asleep, Hee made then haste away, And left the Tinker in the lurch, For the great shot to pay. 19 But when the Tinker wakened, And saw that he was gone, He calld then even for his host, And thus hee made his moan. 20 ‘I had a warrant from the king, Which might have done me good, That is to take a bold outlaw, Some call him Robin Hood. 21 ‘But now my warrant and mony's gone, Nothing I have to pay; And he that promisd to be my friend, He is gone and fled away.’ 22 ‘That friend you tell on,’ said the host, ‘They call him Robin Hood; And when that first hee met with you, He ment you little good.’ 23 ‘Had I known it had been hee, When that I had him here, Th' one of us should have tri'd our strength Which should have paid full dear. 24 ‘In the mean time I must away; No longer here I'le bide; But I will go and seek him out, What ever do me betide. 25 ‘But one thing I would gladly know, What here I have to pay;’ ‘Ten shillings just,’ then said the host; ‘I'le pay without delay. 26 ‘Or elce take here my working-bag, And my good hammer too; And if that I light but on the knave, I will then soon pay you.’ 27 ‘The onely way,’ then said the host, ‘And not to stand in fear, Is to seek him among the parks, Killing of the kings deer.’ 28 The Tinker hee then went with speed, And made then no delay, Till he had found then Robin Hood, That they might have a fray. 29 At last hee spy'd him in a park, Hunting then of the deer; ‘What knave is that,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘That doth come mee so near?’ 30 ‘No knave, no knave,’ the Tinker said, ‘And that you soon shall know; Whether of us hath done most wrong, My crab-tree staff shall show.’ 31 Then Robin drew his gallant blade, Made then of trusty steel; But the Tinker laid on him so fast That he made Robin reel. 32 Then Robins anger did arise; He fought full manfully, Vntil hee had made the Tinker Almost then fit to fly. 33 With that they had a bout again, They ply'd their weapons fast; The Tinker threshed his bones so sore He made him yeeld at last. 34 ‘A boon, a boon,’ Robin hee cryes, ‘If thou wilt grant it mee;’ ‘Before I do it,’ the Tinker said, ‘I'le hang thee on this tree.’ 35 But the Tinker looking him about, Robin his horn did blow; Then came unto him Little John, And William Scadlock too. 36 ‘What is the matter,’ quoth Little John, ‘You sit in th' highway side?’ ‘Here is a Tinker that stands by, That hath paid well my hide.’ 37 ‘That Tinker,’ then said Little John, ‘Fain that blade I would see, And I would try what I could do, If hee'l do as much for mee.’ 38 But Robin hee then wishd them both They should the quarrel cease, ‘That henceforth wee may bee as one, And ever live in peace. 39 ‘And for the jovial Tinker's part, A hundred pound I'le give, In th' year to maintain him on, As long as he doth live. 40 ‘In manhood hee is a mettle man, And a mettle man by trade; I never thought that any man Should have made me so fraid. 41 ‘And if hee will bee one of us, Wee will take all one fare, And whatsoever wee do get, He shall have his full share.’ 42 So the Tinker was content With them to go along, And with them a part to take, And so I end my song. 128 ROBIN HOOD NEWLY REVIVED ROBIN HOOD NEWLY REVIVED ‘Robin Hood Newly Reviv'd.’ a.

The sooner we should have done:’ ‘As I hope to be sav'd,’ the stranger then said, ‘I am his own sisters son.’ 20 But, Lord! what kissing and courting was there, When these two cousins did greet! And they went all that summers day, And Little John did meet. 21 But when they met with Little John, He there unto [him] did say, O master, where have you been, You have tarried so long away? 22 ‘I met with a stranger,’ quoth Robin Hood then, ‘Full sore he hath beaten me:’ ‘Then I'le have a bout with him,’ quoth Little John, ‘And try if he can beat me.’ 23 ‘Oh [no], oh no,’ quoth Robin Hood then, ‘Little John, it may [not] be so; For he's my own dear sisters son, And cousins I have no mo. 24 ‘But he shall be a bold yeoman of mine, My chief man next to thee; And I Robin Hood, and thou Little John, And Scarlet he shall be: 25 ‘And wee'l be three of the bravest outlaws That is in the North Country.’ If you will have any more of bold Robin Hood, In his second part it will be. 129 ROBIN HOOD AND THE PRINCE OF ARAGON ROBIN HOOD AND THE PRINCE OF ARAGON ‘Robin Hood, Will. Scadlock and Little John.’ a. Roxburghe, I, 358, in the Ballad Society's reprint, II, 431. b. Pepys, II, 120, No 106. 1 Now Robin Hood, Will Scadlock and Little John Are walking over the plain, With a good fat buck which Will Scadlock With his strong bow had slain. 2 ‘Jog on, jog on,’ cries Robin Hood, ‘The day it runs full fast; For though my nephew me a breakfast gave, I have not yet broke my fast. 3 ‘Then to yonder lodge let us take our way, I think it wondrous good, Where my nephew by my bold yeomen Shall be welcomd unto the green wood.’ 4 With that he took the bugle-horn, Full well he could it blow; Streight from the woods came marching down One hundred tall fellows and mo. 5 ‘Stand, stand to your arms!’ crys Will Scadlock, ‘Lo! the enemies are within ken:’ With that Robin Hood he laughd aloud, Crys, They are my bold yeomen. 6 Who, when they arriv'd and Robin espy'd, Cry'd, Master, what is your will? We thought you had in danger been, Your horn did sound so shrill. 7 ‘Now nay, now nay,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘The danger is past and gone; I would have you to welcome my nephew here, That hath paid me two for one.’ 8 In feasting and sporting they passed the day, Till Phœbus sunk into the deep; Then each one to his quarters hy'd, His guard there for to keep. 9 Long had they not walked within the green wood, But Robin he was espy'd Of a beautiful damsel all alone, That on a black palfrey did ride. 10 Her riding-suit was of sable hew black, Sypress over her face, Through which her rose-like cheeks did blush, All with a comely grace. 11 ‘Come, tell me the cause, thou pritty one,’ Quoth Robin, ‘and tell me aright, From whence thou comest, and whither thou goest, All in this mournful plight?’ 12 ‘From London I came,’ the damsel reply'd, ‘From London upon the Thames, Which circled is, O grief to tell! Besieg'd with forraign arms. 13 ‘By the proud Prince of Aragon, Who swears by his martial hand To have the princess for his spouse, Or else to waste this land: 14 ‘Except that champions can be found That dare fight three to three, Against the prince and giants twain, Most horrid for to see: 15 ‘Whose grisly looks, and eyes like brands, Strike terrour where they come, With serpents hissing on their helms, Instead of feathered plume. 16 ‘The princess shall be the victors prize, The king hath vowd and said, And he that shall the conquest win Shall have her to his bride. 17 ‘Now we are four damsels sent abroad, To the east, west, north, and south, To try whose fortune is so good To find these champions forth. 18 ‘But all in vaine we have sought about; Yet none so bold there are That dare adventure life and blood, To free a lady fair.’ 19 ‘When is the day?’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘Tell me this and no more:’ ‘On Midsummer next,’ the damsel said, ‘Which is June the twenty-four.’ 20 With that the teares trickled down her cheeks, And silent was her tongue; With sighs and sobs she took her leave, Away her palfrey sprung. 21 This news struck Robin to the heart, He fell down on the grass; His actions and his troubled mind Shewd he perplexed was. 22 ‘Where lies your grief?’ quoth Will Scadlock, ‘O master, tell to me; If the damsels eyes have piercd your heart, I'll fetch her back to thee.’ 23 ‘Now nay, now nay,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘She doth not cause my smart; But it is the poor distressed princess That wounds me to the heart. 24 ‘I will go fight the giants all To set the lady free:’ ‘The devil take my soul,’ quoth Little John, ‘If I part with thy company.’ 25 ‘Must I stay behind?’ quoth Will Scadlock; ‘No, no, that must not be; I'le make the third man in the fight, So we shall be three to three.’ 26 These words cheerd Robin at the heart, Joy shone within his face; Within his arms he huggd them both, And kindly did imbrace. 27 Quoth he, We'll put on mothly gray, With long staves in our hands, A scrip and bottle by our sides, As come from the Holy Land. 28 So may we pass along the high-way; None will ask from whence we came, But take us pilgrims for to be, Or else some holy men. 29 Now they are on their journey gone, As fast as they may speed, Yet for all haste, ere they arriv'd, The princess forth was led: 30 To be deliverd to the prince, Who in the list did stand, Prepar'd to fight, or else receive His lady by the hand. 31 With that he walkt about the lists, With giants by his side: ‘Bring forth,’ said he, ‘your champions, Or bring me forth my bride. 32 ‘This is the four and twentieth day, The day prefixt upon; Bring forth my bride, or London burns, I swear by Acaron.’ 33 Then cries the king, and queen likewise, Both weeping as they speak, Lo! we have brought our daughter dear, Whom we are forcd to forsake. 34 With that stept out bold Robin Hood, Crys, My liege, it must not be so; Such beauty as the fair princess Is not for a tyrants mow. 35 The prince he then began to storm; Crys, Fool, fanatick, baboon! How dares thou stop my valours prize? I'll kill thee with a frown. 36 ‘Thou tyrant Turk, thou infidel,’ Thus Robin began to reply, ‘Thy frowns I scorn; lo! here's my gage, And thus I thee defie. 37 ‘And for these two Goliahs there, That stand on either side, Here are two little Davids by, That soon can tame their pride.’ 38 Then did the king for armour send, For lances, swords, and shields: And thus all three in armour bright Came marching to the field. 39 The trumpets began to sound a charge, Each singled out his man; Their arms in pieces soon were hewd, Blood sprang from every vain. 40 The prince he reacht Robin a blow— He struck with might and main— Which forcd him to reel about the field, As though he had been slain. 41 ‘God-a-mercy,’ quoth Robin, ‘for that blow! The quarrel shall soon be try'd; This stroke shall shew a full divorce Betwixt thee and thy bride.’ 42 So from his shoulders he's cut his head, Which on the ground did fall, And grumbling sore at Robin Hood, To be so dealt withal. 43 The giants then began to rage, To see their prince lie dead: ‘Thou's be the next,’ quoth Little John, ‘Unless thou well guard thy head.’ 44 With that his faulchion he whirld about— It was both keen and sharp— He clove the giant to the belt, And cut in twain his heart. 45 Will Scadlock well had playd his part, The giant he had brought to his knee; Quoth he, The devil cannot break his fast, Unless he have you all three. 46 So with his faulchion he run him through, A deep and gashly wound; Who damd and foamd, cursd and blasphemd, And then fell to the ground. 47 Now all the lists with cheers were filld, The skies they did resound, Which brought the princess to herself, Who was faln in a swound. 48 The king and queen and princess fair Came walking to the place, And gave the champions many thanks, And did them further grace. 49 ‘Tell me,’ quoth the king, ‘whence you are, That thus disguised came, Whose valour speaks that noble blood Doth run through every vain.’ 50 ‘A boon, a boon,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘On my knees I beg and crave:’ ‘By my crown,’ quoth the king, ‘I grant; Ask what, and thou shalt have.’ 51 ‘Then pardon I beg for my merry men, Which are within the green wood, For Little John, and Will Scadlock, And for me, bold Robin Hood.’ 52 ‘Art thou Robin Hood?’ then quoth the king; ‘For the valour you have shewn, Your pardons I doe freely grant, And welcome every one. 53 ‘The princess I promised the victors prize; She cannot have you all three:’ ‘She shall chuse,’ quoth Robin; saith Little John, Then little share falls to me. 54 Then did the princess view all three, With a comely lovely grace, Who took Will Scadlock by the hand, Quoth, Here I make my choice. 55 With that a noble lord stept forth, Of Maxfield earl was he, Who lookt Will Scadlock in the face, Then wept most bitterly. 56 Quoth he, I had a son like thee, Whom I lovd wondrous well; But he is gone, or rather dead; His name is Young Gamwell. 57 Then did Will Scadlock fall on his knees, Cries, Father! father! here, Here kneels your son, your Young Gamwell You said you lovd so dear. 58 But, lord! what imbracing and kissing was there, When all these friends were met! They are gone to the wedding, and so to bedding, And so I bid you good night. 130 ROBIN HOOD AND THE SCOTCHMAN ROBIN HOOD AND THE SCOTCHMAN—A a. Wood, 401, leaf 27 b. b.

And likewise the mountains of snow, Bold Robin Hood he would ramble to see, To frolick abroad with his bow. 2 He left all his merry men waiting behind, Whilst through the green vallies he passd; There did he behold a forester bold, Who cry'd out, Friend, whither so fast? 3 ‘I'm going,’ quoth Robin, ‘to kill a fat buck, For me and my merry men all; Besides, eer I go, I'll have a fat doe, Or else it shall cost me a fall.’ 4 ‘You'd best have a care,’ said the forester then, ‘For these are his majesty's deer; Before you shall shoot, the thing I'll dispute, For I am head-forester here.’ 5 ‘These thirteen long summers,’ quoth Robin, ‘I'm sure, My arrows I here have let fly, Where freely I range; methinks it is strange, You should have more power than I. 6 ‘This forest,’ quoth Robin, ‘I think is my own, And so are the nimble deer too; Therefore I declare, and solemnly swear, I wont be affronted by you.’ 7 The forester he had a long quarter-staff, Likewise a broad sword by his side; Without more ado, he presently drew, Declaring the truth should be try'd. 8 Bold Robin Hood had a sword of the best, Thus, eer he would take any wrong, His courage was flush, he'd venture a brush, And thus they fell to it ding dong. 9 The very first blow that the forester gave, He made his broad weapon cry twang; 'Twas over the head, he fell down for dead, O that was a damnable bang! 10 But Robin he soon did recover himself, And bravely fell to it again; The very next stroke their weapons were broke, Yet never a man there was slain. 11 At quarter-staff then they resolved to play, Because they would have t'other bout; And brave Robin Hood right valiantly stood, Unwilling he was to give out. 12 Bold Robin he gave him very hard blows, The other returnd them as fast; At every stroke their jackets did smoke, Three hours the combat did last. 13 At length in a rage the bold forester grew, And cudgeld bold Robin so sore That he could not stand, so shaking his hand, He said, Let us freely give oer. 14 Thou art a brave fellow, I needs must confess I never knew any so good; Thou'rt fitting to be a yeoman for me, And range in the merry green wood. 15 I'll give thee this ring as a token of love, For bravely thou'st acted thy part; That man that can fight, in him I delight, And love him with all my whole heart. 16 Then Robin Hood setting his horn to his mouth, A blast he merrily blows; His yeomen did hear, and strait did appear, A hundred, with trusty long bows. 17 Now Little John came at the head of them all, Cloathd in a rich mantle of green; And likewise the rest were gloriously drest, A delicate sight to be seen. 18 ‘Lo, these are my yeomen,’ said Robin Hood, ‘And thou shalt be one of the train; A mantle and bow, a quiver also, I give them whom I entertain.’ 19 The forester willingly enterd the list, They were such a beautiful sight; Then with a long bow they shot a fat doe, And made a rich supper that night. 20 What singing and dancing was in the green wood, For joy of another new mate! With mirth and delight they spent the long night, And liv'd at a plentiful rate. 21 The forester neer was so merry before As then he was with these brave souls, Who never would fail, in wine, beer or ale, To take off their cherishing bowls. 22 Then Robin Hood gave him a mantle of green, Broad arrows, and a curious long bow; This done, the next day, so gallant and gay, He marched them all on a row. 23 Quoth he, My brave yeomen, be true to your trust, And then we may range the woods wide: They all did declare, and solemnly swear, They'd conquer, or die by his side. 132 THE BOLD PEDLAR AND ROBIN HOOD THE BOLD PEDLAR AND ROBIN HOOD J.

Down a down a down a down, Down a down a down 2 By chance he met two troublesome blades, Two troublesome blades they chanced to be; The one of them was bold Robin Hood, And the other was Little John so free. 3 ‘O pedlar, pedlar, what is in thy pack? Come speedilie and tell to me:’ ‘I've several suits of the gay green silks, And silken bow-strings two or three.’ 4 ‘If you have several suits of the gay green silk, And silken bow-strings two or three, Then it's by my body,’ cries Little John, ‘One half your pack shall belong to me.’ 5 ‘O nay, o nay,’ says the pedlar bold, ‘O nay, o nay, that never can be; For there's never a man from fair Nottingham Can take one half my pack from me.’ 6 Then the pedlar he pulled off his pack, And put it a little below his knee, Saying, If you do move me one perch from this, My pack and all shall gang with thee. 7 Then Little John he drew his sword, The pedlar by his pack did stand; They fought until they both did sweat, Till he cried, Pedlar, pray hold your hand! 8 Then Robin Hood he was standing by, And he did laugh most heartilie; Saying, I could find a man, of a smaller scale, Could thrash the pedlar and also thee. 9 ‘Go you try, master,’ says Little John, ‘Go you try, master, most speedilie, Or by my body,’ says Little John, ‘I am sure this night you will not know me.’ 10 Then Robin Hood he drew his sword, And the pedlar by his pack did stand; They fought till the blood in streams did flow, Till he cried, Pedlar, pray hold your hand! 11 Pedlar, pedlar, what is thy name? Come speedilie and tell to me: ‘My name! my name I neer will tell, Till both your names you have told to me.’ 12 ‘The one of us is bold Robin Hood, And the other Little John so free:’ ‘Now,’ says the pedlar, ‘it lays to my good will, Whether my name I chuse to tell to thee. 13 ‘I am Gamble Gold of the gay green woods, And travelled far beyond the sea; For killing a man in my father's land From my country I was forced to flee.’ 14 ‘If you are Gamble Gold of the gay green woods, And travelled far beyond the sea, You are my mother's own sister's son; What nearer cousins then can we be?’ 15 They sheathed their swords with friendly words, So merrilie they did agree; They went to a tavern, and there they dined, And bottles cracked most merrilie. 133 ROBIN HOOD AND THE BEGGAR, I ROBIN HOOD AND THE BEGGAR, I a.

I'll tell you of a brave booting That befel Robin Hood. 2 Robin Hood upon a day, He went forth him alone, And as he came from Barnesdale Into a fair evening, 3 He met a beggar on the way, That sturdily could gang; He had a pike-staff in his hand, That was baith stark and strang. 4 A clouted cloak about him was, That held him from the cold; The thinnest bit of it, I guess, Was more than twenty fold. 5 His meal-pock hang about his neck, Into a leathern fang, Well fastened with a broad buckle, That was both stark and strang. 6 He had three hats upon his head, Together sticked fast; He cared neither for wind nor weet, In lands wherever he past. 7 Good Robin coost him in his way, To see what he might be; If any beggar had money, He thought some part had he. 8 ‘Tarry, tarry,’ good Robin says, ‘Tarry, and speak with me;’ He heard him as he heard [him] not, And fast his way can hie. 9 ‘It be's not so,’ says good Robin, ‘Nay, thou must tarry still;’ ‘By my troth,’ says the bold beggar, ‘Of that I have no will. 10 ‘It is far to my lodging-house, And it is growing late; If they have supt ere I come in, I will look wondrous blate.’ 11 ‘Now, by my troth,’ says good Robin, ‘I see well by thy fare, If thou chear well to thy supper, Of mine thou takes no care; 12 ‘Who wants my dinner all the day, And wots not where to lie, And should I to the tavern go, I want money to buy. 13 ‘Sir, thou must lend me some money, Till we two meet again:’ The beggar answerd cankerdly, I have no money to lend. 14 Thou art as young a man as I, And seems to be as sweer; If thou fast till thou get from me, Thou shalt eat none this year. 15 ‘Now, by my troth,’ says good Robin, ‘Since we are sembled so, If thou have but a small farthing, I'll have it ere thou go. 16 ‘Therefore, lay down thy clouted cloak, And do no longer stand, And loose the strings of all thy pocks; I'll ripe them with my hand. 17 ‘And now to thee I make a vow, If thou make any din, I shall see if a broad arrow Can pierce a beggar's skin.’ 18 The beggar smil'd, and answer made: Far better let me be; Think not that I will be afraid For thy nip crooked tree. 19 Or that I fear thee any whit For thy curn nips of sticks; I know no use for them so meet As to be pudding-pricks. 20 Here I defy thee to do me ill, For all thy boistrous fare; Thou's get nothing from me but ill, Would thou seek it evermair. 21 Good Robin bent his noble bow — He was an angry man — And in it set a broad arrow; Yet er't was drawn a span, 22 The beggar, with his noble tree, Reacht him so round a rout That his bow and his broad arrow In flinders flew about. 23 Good Robin bound him to his brand, But that provd likewise vain; The beggar lighted on his hand With his pike-staff again. 24 I wot he might not draw a sword For forty days and more; Good Robin could not speak a word, His heart was never so sore. 25 He could not fight, he could not flee, He wist not what to do; The beggar, with his noble tree, Laid lusty flaps him to. 26 He paid good Robin back and side, And beft him up and down, And with his pike-staff still on laid Till he fell in a swoon. 27 ‘Fy! stand up, man,’ the beggar said, ‘'Tis shame to go to rest; Stay still till thou get thy mony [told], I think it were the best. 28 ‘And syne go to the tavern-house, And buy both wine and ale; Hereat thy friends will crack full crouse, Thou has been at a dale.’ 29 Good Robin answerd never a word, But lay still as a stane; His cheeks were white as any clay, And closed were his eyne. 30 The beggar thought him dead but fail, And boldly bownd away; I would you had been at the dale, And gotten part of the play. 31 Now three of Robin's men, by chance, Came walking on the way, And found their master in a trance, On ground where he did lie. 32 Up have they taken good Robin, Making a piteous bier, Yet saw they no man there at whom They might the matter spear. 33 They looked him all round about, But wounds on him saw none, Yet at his mouth came bocking out The blood of a good vein. 34 Cold water they have taken syne, And cast into his face; Then he began to lift his eyne, And spake within short space. 35 ‘Tell us, dear master,’ says his men, ‘How with you stands the case?’ Good Robin sighd ere he began To tell of his disgrace. 36 ‘I have been watchman in this wood Near hand this forty year, Yet I was never so hard bestead As you have found me here. 37 ‘A beggar with a clouted cloak, In whom I feard no ill, Hath with a pike-staff clawd my back; I fear't shall never be well. 38 ‘See, where he goes out oer yon hill, With hat upon his head; If ever you lovd your master well, Go now revenge this deed. 39 ‘And bring him back again to me, If it lie in your might, That I may see, before I die, Him punisht in my sight. 40 ‘And if you may not bring him back, Let him not go loose on; For to us all it were great shame If he escapt again.’ 41 ‘One of us shall with you remain, Because you're ill at ease; The other two shall bring him back, To use him as you please.’ 42 ‘Now, by my troth,’ says good Robin, ‘I trow there's enough said; If he get scouth to weild his tree, I fear you'll both be paid.’ 43 ‘Be ye not feard, our good master, That we two can be dung With any blutter base beggar, That hath nought but a rung. 44 ‘His staff shall stand him in no stead; That you shall shortly see; But back again he shall be led, And fast bound shall he be, To see if you will have him slain, Or hanged on a tree.’ 45 ‘But cast you slily in his way, Before he be aware, And on his pike-staff first lay hands; You'll speed the better far.’ 46 Now leave we Robin with his man, Again to play the child, And learn himself to stand and gang By haulds, for all his eild. 47 Now pass we to the bold beggar, That raked oer the hill, Who never mended his pace no more Nor he had done no ill. 48 The young men knew the country well, So soon where he would be, And they have taken another way, Was nearer by miles three. 49 They rudely ran with all their might, Spar'd neither dub nor mire, They stirred neither at laigh nor hight, No travel made them tire, 50 Till they before the beggar wan, And coost them in his way; A little wood lay in a glen, And there they both did stay. 51 They stood up closely by a tree, In ilk side of the gate, Until the beggar came them to, That thought not of such fate. 52 And as he was betwixt them past, They leapt upon him baith; The one his pike-staff gripped fast, They feared for its scaith. 53 The other he held in his sight A drawn dirk to his breast, And said, False carl, quit thy staff, Or I shall be thy priest. 54 His pike-staff they have taken him frae, And stuck it in the green; He was full leath to let [it] gae, If better might have been. 55 The beggar was the feardest man Of one that ever might be; To win away no way he can, Nor help him with his tree. 56 He wist not wherefore he was tane, Nor how many was there; He thought his life-days had been gone, And grew into despair. 57 ‘Grant me my life,’ the beggar said, ‘For him that died on tree, And take away that ugly knife, Or then for fear I'll die. 58 ‘I grievd you never in all my life, By late nor yet by ayre; Ye have great sin, if ye should slay A silly poor beggar.’ 59 ‘Thou lies, false lown,’ they said again, ‘By all that may be sworn; Thou hast near slain the gentlest man That ever yet was born. 60 ‘And back again thou shalt be led, And fast bound shalt thou be, To see if he will have thee slain, Or hanged on a tree.’ 61 The beggar then thought all was wrong; They were set for his wrack; He saw nothing appearing then But ill upon worse back. 62 Were he out of their hands, he thought, And had again his tree, He should not be had back for nought, With such as he did see. 63 Then he bethought him on a wile, If it could take effect, How he the young men might beguile, And give them a begeck. 64 Thus for to do them shame or ill His beastly breast was bent; He found the wind grew something shril, To further his intent. 65 He said, Brave gentlemen, be good, And let the poor man be; When ye have taken a beggar's blood, It helps you not a flee. 66 It was but in my own defence, If he hath gotten skaith; But I will make a recompence, Much better for you baith. 67 If ye will set me safe and free, And do me no danger, An hundred pounds I will you give, And much more good silver, 68 That I have gathered these many years, Under this clouted cloak, And hid up wonder privately, In bottom of my pock. 69 The young men to a council yeed, And let the beggar gae; They wist how well he had no speed From them to run away. 70 They thought they would the money take, Come after what so may, And then they would not bring him back, But in that part him slay. 71 By that good Robin would not know That they had gotten coin; It would content him for to show That there they had him slain. 72 They said, False carl, soon have done And tell forth that money; For the ill turn thou hast done 'Tis but a simple fee. 73 And yet we will not have thee back, Come after what so may, If thou will do that which thou spake, And make us present pay. 74 O then he loosd his clouted cloak, And spread it on the ground, And thereon laid he many a pock, Betwixt them and the wind. 75 He took a great bag from his hase; It was near full of meal; Two pecks in it at least there was, And more, I wot full well. 76 Upon his cloak he laid it down, The mouth he opend wide, To turn the same he made him bown, The young men ready spy'd. 77 In every hand he took a nook Of that great leathern meal, And with a fling the meal he shook Into their faces hail. 78 Wherewith he blinded them so close A stime they could not see; And then in heart he did rejoice, And clapt his lusty tree. 79 He thought, if he had done them wrong In mealing of their cloaths, For to strike off the meal again With his pike-staff he goes. 80 Or any one of them could red their eyne, Or yet a glimmering could see, Ilk ane of them a dozen had, Well laid on with the tree. 81 The young men were right swift of foot, And boldly ran away; The beggar could them no more hit, For all the haste he may. 82 ‘What ails this haste?’ the beggar said, ‘May ye not tarry still, Until your money be receivd? I'll pay you with good will. 83 ‘The shaking of my pocks, I fear, Hath blown into your eyne; But I have a good pike-staff here Will ripe them out full clean.’ 84 The young men answerd neer a word, They were dumb as a stane; In the thick wood the beggar fled, Eer they riped their eyne. 85 And syne the night became so late, To seek him was but vain: But judge ye, if they looked blate When they came home again. 86 Good Robin speard how they had sped; They answerd him, Full ill; ‘That cannot be,’ good Robin says; ‘Ye have been at the mill. 87 ‘The mill it is a meatrif place, They may lick what they please; Most like ye have been at that art, Who would look to your cloaths.’ 88 They hangd their heads, and droped down, A word they could not speak: Robin said, Because I fell a-swoon, I think you'll do the like. 89 Tell on the matter, less and more, And tell me what and how Ye have done with the bold beggar I sent you for right now. 90 And then they told him to an end, As I have said before, How that the beggar did them blind, What misters process more. 91 And how he lin'd their shoulders broad With his great trenchen tree, And how in the thick wood he fled, Eer they a stime could see. 92 And how they scarcely could win home, Their bones were beft so sore: Good Robin cry'd, Fy! out, for shame! We're sham'd for evermore. 93 Altho good Robin would full fain Of his wrong revenged be, He smil'd to see his merry young men Had gotten a taste of the tree. 135 ROBIN HOOD AND THE SHEPHERD ROBIN HOOD AND THE SHEPHERD a.

Down, etc. 2 As Robin Hood walkt the forrest along, Some pastime for to spie, There was he aware of a jolly shepherd, That on the ground did lie. 3 ‘Arise, arise,’ cryed jolly Robin, ‘And now come let me see What is in thy bag and bottle, I say; Come tell it unto me.’ 4 ‘What's that to thee, thou proud fellow? Tell me as I do stand What thou hast to do with my bag and bottle? Let me see thy command.’ 5 ‘My sword, which hangeth by my side, Is my command I know; Come, and let me taste of thy bottle, Or it may breed thee wo.’ 6 ‘Tut, the devil a drop, thou proud fellow, Of my bottle thou shalt see, Untill thy valour here be tried, Whether thou wilt fight or flee.’ 7 ‘What shall we fight for?’ cries bold Robin Hood; ‘Come tell it soon to me; Here is twenty pounds in good red gold; Win it, and take it thee.’ 8 The Shepherd stood all in a maze, And knew not what to say: ‘I have no money, thou proud fellow, But bag and bottle I'le lay.’ 9 ‘I am content, thou shepherd-swain, Fling them down on the ground; But it will breed thee mickle pain, To win my twenty pound.’ 10 ‘Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow, Thou stands too long to prate; This hook of mine shall let thee know A coward I do hate.’ 11 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore; It was on a summers day; From ten till four in the afternoon The Shepherd held him play. 12 Robins buckler proved his chief defence, And saved him many a bang, For every blow the Shepherd gave Made Robins sword cry twang. 13 Many a sturdy blow the Shepherd gave, And that bold Robin found, Till the blood ran trickling from his head; Then he fell to the ground. 14 ‘Arise, arise, thou proud fellow, And thou shalt have fair play, If thou wilt yield, before thou go, That I have won the day.’ 15 ‘A boon, a boon,’ cried bold Robin; ‘If that a man thou be, Then let me take my beaugle-horn, And blow but blasts three.’ 16 ‘To blow three times three,’ the Shepherd said, ‘I will not thee deny; For if thou shouldst blow till to-morrow morn, I scorn one foot to fly.’ 17 Then Robin set his horn to his mouth, And he blew with mickle main, Until he espied Little John Come tripping over the plain. 18 ‘O who is yonder, thou proud fellow, That comes down yonder hill?’ ‘Yonder is Little John, bold Robin Hoods man, Shall fight with thee thy fill.’ 19 ‘What is the matter?’ saies Little John, ‘Master, come tell to me:’ ‘My case is great,’ saies Robin Hood, ‘For the Shepherd hath conquered me.’ 20 ‘I am glad of that,’ cries Little John, ‘Shepherd, turn thou to me; For a bout with thee I mean to have, Either come fight or flee.’ 21 ‘With all my heart, thou proud fellow, For it never shall be said That a shepherds hook of thy sturdy look Will one jot be dismaid.’ 22 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore, Striving for victory; ‘I will know,’ saies John, ‘ere we give ore, Whether thou wilt fight or flye.’ 23 The Shepherd gave John a sturdy blow, With his hook under the chin; ‘Beshrew thy heart,’ said Little John, ‘Thou basely dost begin.’ 24 ‘Nay, that's nothing,’ said the Shepherd; ‘Either yield to me the day, Or I will bang thee back and sides, Before thou goest thy way. 25 ‘What? dost thou think, thou proud fellow, That thou canst conquer me? Nay, thou shalt know, before thou go, I'le fight before I'le flee.’ 26 With that to thrash Little John like mad The Shepherd he begun; ‘Hold, hold,’ cryed bold Robin Hood, ‘And I'le yield the wager won.’ 27 ‘With all my heart,’ said Little John, ‘To that I will agree; For he is the flower of shepherd-swains, The like I never did see.’ 28 Thus have you heard of Robin Hood, Also of Little John, How a shepherd-swain did conquer them; The like did never none. 136 ROBIN HOOD'S DELIGHT (ROBIN HOOD, JOHN, SCARLOCK AND THREE KEEPERS) ROBIN HOOD'S DELIGHT (ROBIN HOOD, JOHN, SCARLOCK AND THREE KEEPERS) a.

Pepys, II, 112, No 99. 1 There is some will talk of lords and knights, Doun a doun a doun a doun And some of yeoman good, But I will tell you of Will Scarlock, Little John and Robin Hood. Doun a doun a doun a doun 2 They were outlaws, as't is well known, And men of a noble blood; And a many a time was their valour shown In the forrest of merry Sheerwood. 3 Vpon a time it chanced so, As Robin Hood would have it be, They all three would a walking go, Some pastime for to see. 4 And as they walked the forest along, Upon a midsummer day, There was they aware of three keepers, Clade all in green aray. 5 With brave long faucheons by their sides, And forest-bills in hand, They calld aloud to those bold outlaws, And charged them to stand. 6 ‘Why who are you,’ cry'd bold Robin, ‘That speaks so boldly here?’ ‘We three belong to King Henry, And are keepers of his deer.’ 7 ‘The devil thou art!’ sayes Robin Hood, ‘I am sure that it is not so; We be the keepers of this forest, And that you soon shall know. 8 ‘Come, your coats of green lay on the ground, And so will we all three, And take your swords and bucklers round, And try the victory.’ 9 ‘We be content,’ the keepers said, ‘We be three, and you no less; Then why should we be of you afraid, And we never did transgress?’ 10 ‘Why, if you be three keepers in this forest, Then we be three rangers good, And we will make you to know, before you do go, You meet with bold Robin Hood.’ 11 ‘We be content, thou bold outlaw, Our valour here to try, And we will make you know, before we do go, We will fight before we will fly. 12 ‘Then, come draw your swords, you bold outlaws, And no longer stand to prate, But let us try it out with blows, For cowards we do hate. 13 ‘Here is one of us for Will Scarlock, And another for Little John, And I my self for Robin Hood, Because he is stout and strong.’ 14 So they fell to it full hard and sore; It was on a midsummers day; From eight a clock till two and past, They all shewed gallant play. 15 There Robin, and Will, and Little John, They fought most manfully, Till all their winde was spent and gone, Then Robin aloud did cry: 16 ‘O hold, O hold,’ cries bold Robin, ‘I see you be stout men; Let me blow one blast on my bugle-horn, Then I'le fight with you again.’ 17 ‘That bargain's to make, bold Robin Hood, Therefore we it deny; Though a blast upon thy bugle-horn Cannot make us fight nor fly. 18 ‘Therefore fall on, or else be gone, And yield to us the day: It shall never be said that we were afraid Of thee, nor thy yeomen gay.’ 19 ‘If that be so,’ cries bold Robin, ‘Let me but know your names, And in the forest of merry Sheerwood I shall extol your fames.’ 20 ‘And with our names,’ one of them said, ‘What hast thou here to do? Except that you will fight it out, Our names thou shalt not know.’ 21 ‘We will fight no more,’ sayes bold Robin, ‘You be men of valour stout; Come and go with me to Nottingham, And there we will fight it out. 22 ‘With a but of sack we will bang it out, To see who wins the day; And for the cost, make you no doubt I have gold and money to pay 23 ‘And ever after, so long as we live, We all will brethren be; For I love those men with heart and hand That will fight, and never flee.’ 24 So away they went to Nottingham, With sack to make amends; For three dayes space they wine did chase, And drank themselves good friends. 137 ROBIN HOOD AND THE PEDLARS Robinhood and the Peddlers The fourth ballad in a MS. formerly in the possession of J. Payne Collier, now in the British Museum; previously printed in Gutch's Robin Hood, II, 351. 1 Will you heare a tale of Robin Hood, Will Scarlett, and Little John? Now listen awhile, it will make you smile, As before it hath many done. 2 They were archers three, of hie degree, As good as ever drewe bowe; Their arrowes were long and their armes were strong, As most had cause to knowe. 3 But one sommers day, as they toke their way Through the forrest of greene Sherwood, To kill the kings deare, you shall presently heare What befell these archers good. 4 They were ware on the roade of three peddlers with loade, Ffor each had his packe, Ffull of all wares for countrie faires, Trusst up upon his backe. 5 A good oke staffe, a yard and a halfe, Each one had in his hande; And they were all bound to Nottingham towne, As you shall understand. 6 ‘Yonder I see bolde peddlers three,’ Said Robin to Scarlett and John; ‘We'le search their packes upon their backes Before that they be gone. 7 ‘Holla, good fellowes!’ quod Robin Hood, ‘Whither is it ye doe goe? Now stay and rest, for that is the best, 'Tis well ye should doe soe.’ 8 ‘Noe rest we neede, on our roade we speede, Till to Nottingham we get:’ ‘Thou tellst a lewde lye,’ said Robin, ‘for I Can see that ye swinke and swet.’ 9 The peddlers three crosst over the lee, They did not list to fight: ‘I charge you tarrie,’ quod Robin, ‘for marry, This is my owne land by right. 10 ‘This is my mannor and this is my parke, I would have ye for to knowe; Ye are bolde outlawes, I see by cause Ye are so prest to goe.’ 11 The peddlers three turned round to see Who it might be they herd; Then agen went on as they list to be gone, And never answered word. 12 Then toke Robin Hood an arrow so good, Which he did never lacke, And drew his bowe, and the swift arrowe Went through the last peddlers packe. 13 Ffor him it was well on the packe it fell, Or his life had found an ende; And it pierst the skin of his backe within, Though the packe did stand his frend. 14 Then downe they flung their packes eche one, And stayde till Robin came: Quod Robin, I saide ye had better stayde; Good sooth, ye were to blame. 15 ‘And who art thou? by S. Crispin, I vowe I'le quickly cracke thy head!’ Cried Robin, Come on, all three, or one; It is not so soone done as said. 16 My name, by the roode, is Robin Hood, And this is Scarlett and John; It is three to three, ye may plainelie see, Soe now, brave fellowes, laye on. 17 The first peddlars blowe brake Robins bowe That he had in his hand; And Scarlett and John, they eche had one That they unneath could stand. 18 ‘Now holde your handes,’ cride Robin Hood, ‘Ffor ye have got oken staves; But tarie till wee can get but three, And a fig for all your braves.’ 19 Of the peddlers the first, his name Kit o Thirske, Said, We are all content; Soe eche tooke a stake for his weapon, to make The peddlers to repent. 20 Soe to it they fell, and their blowes did ring well Uppon the others backes; And gave the peddlers cause to wish They had not cast their packes. 21 Yet the peddlers three of their blowes were so free That Robin began for to rue; And Scarlett and John had such loade laide on It made the sunne looke blue. 22 At last Kits oke caught Robin a stroke That made his head to sound; He staggerd, and reelde, till he fell on the fielde, And the trees with him went round. 23 ‘Now holde your handes,’ cride Little John, And soe said Scarlett eke; ‘Our maister is slaine, I tell you plaine, He never more will speake.’ 24 ‘Now, heaven forefend he come to that ende,’ Said Kit, ‘I love him well; But lett him learne to be wise in turne, And not with pore peddlers mell. 25 ‘In my packe, God wot, I a balsame have got That soone his hurts will heale;’ And into Robin Hoods gaping mouth He presentlie powrde some deale. 26 ‘Now fare ye well, tis best not to tell How ye three peddlers met; Or if ye doe, prithee tell alsoe How they made ye swinke and swett.’ 27 Poore Robin in sound they left on the ground, And hied them to Nottingham, While Scarlett and John Robin tended on, Till at length his senses came. 28 Noe soone[r], in haste, did Robin Hood taste The balsame he had tane, Than he gan to spewe, and up he threwe The balsame all againe. 29 And Scarlett and John, who were looking on Their maister as he did lie, Had their faces besmeard, both eies and beard, Therewith most piteously. 30 Thus ended that fray; soe beware alwaye How ye doe challenge foes; Looke well aboute they are not to stoute, Or you may have worst of the blowes. 138 ROBIN HOOD AND ALLEN A DALE ROBIN HOOD AND ALLEN A DALE a. ‘Robin Hood and Allin of Dale,’ Douce, II, leaf 185. b. ‘Robin Hood and Allin of Dale,’ Pepys, II, 110, No 97. c. ‘Robin Hood and Allen a Dale,’ Douce, III, 119 b. 1 Come listen to me, you gallants so free, All you that loves mirth for to hear, And I will you tell of a bold outlaw, That lived in Nottinghamshire. (bis.) 2 As Robin Hood in the forrest stood, All under the green-wood tree, There was he ware of a brave young man, As fine as fine might be. 3 The youngster was clothed in scarlet red, In scarlet fine and gay, And he did frisk it over the plain, And chanted a roundelay. 4 As Robin Hood next morning stood, Amongst the leaves so gay, There did he espy the same young man Come drooping along the way. 5 The scarlet he wore the day before, It was clean cast away; And every step he fetcht a sigh, ‘Alack and a well a day!’ 6 Then stepped forth brave Little John, And Nick the millers son, Which made the young man bend his bow, When as he see them come. 7 ‘Stand off, stand off,’ the young man said, ‘What is your will with me?’ ‘You must come before our master straight, Vnder yon green-wood tree.’ 8 And when he came bold Robin before, Robin askt him courteously, O hast thou any money to spare For my merry men and me? 9 ‘I have no money,’ the young man said, ‘But five shillings and a ring; And that I have kept this seven long years, To have it at my wedding. 10 ‘Yesterday I should have married a maid, But she is now from me tane, And chosen to be an old knights delight, Whereby my poor heart is slain.’ 11 ‘What is thy name?’ then said Robin Hood, ‘Come tell me, without any fail:’ ‘By the faith of my body,’ then said the young man, ‘My name it is Allin a Dale.’ 12 ‘What wilt thou give me,’ said Robin Hood, ‘In ready gold or fee, To help thee to thy true-love again, And deliver her unto thee?’ 13 ‘I have no money,’ then quoth the young man, ‘No ready gold nor fee, But I will swear upon a book Thy true servant for to be.’ 14 ‘How many miles is it to thy true-love? Come tell me without any guile:’ ‘By the faith of my body,’ then said the young man, ‘It is but five little mile.’ 15 Then Robin he hasted over the plain, He did neither stint nor lin, Vntil he came unto the church Where Allin should keep his wedding. 16 ‘What dost thou do here?’ the bishop he said, ‘I prethee now tell to me:’ ‘I am a bold harper,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘And the best in the north countrey.’ 17 ‘O welcome, O welcome,’ the bishop he said, ‘That musick best pleaseth me;’ ‘You shall have no musick,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘Till the bride and the bridegroom I see.’ 18 With that came in a wealthy knight, Which was both grave and old, And after him a finikin lass, Did shine like glistering gold. 19 ‘This is no fit match,’ quoth bold Robin Hood, ‘That you do seem to make here; For since we are come unto the church, The bride she shall chuse her own dear.’ 20 Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth, And blew blasts two or three; When four and twenty bowmen bold Came leaping over the lee. 21 And when they came into the church-yard, Marching all on a row, The first man was Allin a Dale, To give bold Robin his bow. 22 ‘This is thy true-love,’ Robin he said, ‘Young Allin, as I hear say; And you shall be married at this same time, Before we depart away.’ 23 ‘That shall not be,’ the bishop he said, ‘For thy word shall not stand; They shall be three times askt in the church, As the law is of our land.’ 24 Robin Hood pulld off the bishops coat, And put it upon Little John; ‘By the faith of my body,’ then Robin said, ‘This cloath doth make thee a man.’ 25 When Little John went into the quire, The people began for to laugh; He askt them seven times in the church, Least three times should not be enough. 26 ‘Who gives me this maid,’ then said Little John; Quoth Robin, That do I, And he that doth take her from Allin a Dale Full dearly he shall her buy. 27 And thus having ended this merry wedding, The bride lookt as fresh as a queen, And so they returnd to the merry green wood, Amongst the leaves so green. 139 ROBIN HOOD'S PROGRESS TO NOTTINGHAM ROBIN HOOD'S PROGRESS TO NOTTINGHAM a.

What news?’ said bold Robin Hood; ‘What news, fain wouldest thou know? Our king hath provided a shooting-match:’ ‘And I'm ready with my bow.’ 4 ‘We hold it in scorn,’ then said the forresters, ‘That ever a boy so young Should bear a bow before our king, That's not able to draw one string.’ 5 ‘I'le hold you twenty marks,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘By the leave of Our Lady, That I'le hit a mark a hundred rod, And I'le cause a hart to dye.’ 6 ‘We'l hold you twenty mark,’ then said the forresters, ‘By the leave of Our Lady, Thou hitst not the marke a hundred rod, Nor causest a hart to dye.’ 7 Robin Hood he bent up a noble bow, And a broad arrow he let flye, He hit the mark a hundred rod, And he caused a hart to dy. 8 Some said hee brake ribs one or two, And some said hee brake three; The arrow within the hart would not abide, But it glanced in two or three. 9 The hart did skip, and the hart did leap, And the hart lay on the ground; ‘The wager is mine,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘If't were for a thousand pound.’ 10 ‘The wager's none of thine,’ then said the forresters, ‘Although thou beest in haste; Take up thy bow, and get thee hence, Lest wee thy sides do baste.’ 11 Robin Hood hee took up his noble bow, And his broad arrows all amain, And Robin Hood he laught, and begun to smile, As hee went over the plain. 12 Then Robin Hood hee bent his noble bow, And his broad arrows he let flye, Till fourteen of these fifteen forresters Vpon the ground did lye. 13 He that did this quarrel first begin Went tripping over the plain; But Robin Hood he bent his noble bow, And hee fetcht him back again. 14 ‘You said I was no archer,’ said Robin Hood, ‘But say so now again;’ With that he sent another arrow That split his head in twain. 15 ‘You have found mee an archer,’ saith Robin Hood, ‘Which will make your wives for to wring, And wish that you had never spoke the word, That I could not draw one string.’ 16 The people that lived in fair Nottingham Came runing out amain, Supposing to have taken bold Robin Hood, With the forresters that were slain. 17 Some lost legs, and some lost arms, And some did lose their blood, But Robin Hood hee took up his noble bow, And is gone to the merry green wood. 18 They carryed these forresters into fair Nottingham, As many there did know; They digd them graves in their church-yard, And they buried them all a row. 140 ROBIN HOOD RESCUING THREE SQUIRES ROBIN HOOD RESCUING THREE SQUIRES—A Percy MS., p.5; Hales and Furnivall, I, 13; Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 49. 1 ‘ In faith thou shal[t] haue mine, And twenty pound in thy purse, To spend att ale and wine.’ 2 ‘Though your clothes are of light Lincolne green, And mine gray russett and torne, Yet it doth not you beseeme To doe an old man scorne.’ 3 ‘I scorne thee not, old man,’ says Robin, ‘By the faith of my body; Doe of thy clothes, thou shalt haue mine, For it may noe better bee.’ 4 But Robin did on this old mans hose, The were torne in the wrist; ‘When I looke on my leggs,’ said Robin, ‘Then for to laugh I list.’ 5 But Robin did on the old mans shooes, And the were cliitt full cleane; ‘Now, by my faith,’ sayes Litle Iohn, ‘These are good for thornës keene.’ 6 But Robin did on the old mans cloake, And it was torne in the necke; ‘Now, by my faith,’ said William Scarlett, ‘Heere shold be set a specke.’ 7 But Robin did on this old mans hood, Itt gogled on his crowne; ‘When I come into Nottingham,’ said Robin, ‘My hood it will lightly downe. 8 ‘But yonder is an outwood,’ said Robin, ‘An outwood all and a shade, And thither I reede you, my merrymen all, The ready way to take. 9 ‘And when you heare my litle horne blow, Come raking all on a rowte 10 But Robin he lope, and Robin he threw, He lope over stocke and stone; But those that saw Robin Hood run Said he was a liuer old man. 11 [Then Robin set his] horne to his mowth, A loud blast cold h[e] blow; Ffull three hundred bold yeomen Came rakinge all on a row. 12 But Robin cast downe his baggs of bread, Soe did he his staffe with a face, And in a doublet of red veluett This yeoman stood in his place. 13 ‘But bend your bowes, and stroke your strings, Set the gallow-tree aboute, And Christs cursse on his heart,’ said Robin, ‘That spares the sheriffe and the sergiant!’ 14 When the sheriffe see gentle Robin wold shoote, He held vp both his hands; Sayes, Aske, good Robin, and thou shalt haue, Whether it be house or land. 15 ‘I will neither haue house nor land,’ said Robin, ‘Nor gold, nor none of thy ffee, But I will haue those three squires To the greene fforest with me. 16 ‘Now marry, Gods forbott,’ said the sheriffe, ‘That euer that shold bee; For why, they be the kings ffelons, They are all condemned to dye.’ 17 ‘But grant me my askinge,’ said Robin, ‘Or by the faith of my body Thou shalt be the first man Shall flower this gallow-tree.’ 18 ‘But I wi[ll haue t]hose three squires Robin Hood rescuing the Widow's Three Sons from the Sheriff, when going to be executed ROBIN HOOD RESCUING THREE SQUIRES—B a.

What news hast thou for me?’ Said she, There's three squires in Nottingham town To-day is condemned to die. 4 ‘O have they parishes burnt?’ he said, ‘Or have they ministers slain? Or have they robbed any virgin, Or with other men's wives have lain?’ 5 ‘They have no parishes burnt, good sir, Nor yet have ministers slain, Nor have they robbed any virgin, Nor with other men's wives have lain.’ 6 ‘O what have they done?’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘I pray thee tell to me:’ ‘It's for slaying of the king's fallow deer, Bearing their long bows with thee.’ 7 ‘Dost thou not mind, old woman,’ he said, ‘Since thou made me sup and dine? By the truth of my body,’ quoth bold Robin Hood, ‘You could not tell it in better time.’ 8 Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone, With a link a down and a day, And there he met with a silly old palmer, Was walking along the highway. 9 ‘What news? what news, thou silly old man? What news, I do thee pray?’ Said he, Three squires in Nottingham town Are condemnd to die this day. 10 ‘Come change thy apparel with me, old man, Come change thy apparel for mine; Here is forty shillings in good silver, Go drink it in beer or wine.’ 11 ‘O thine apparel is good,’ he said, ‘And mine is ragged and torn; Whereever you go, wherever you ride, Laugh neer an old man to scorn.’ 12 ‘Come change thy apparel with me, old churl, Come change thy apparel with mine; Here are twenty pieces of good broad gold, Go feast thy brethren with wine.’ 13 Then he put on the old man's hat, It stood full high on the crown: ‘The first bold bargain that I come at, It shall make thee come down.’ 14 Then he put on the old man's cloak, Was patchd black, blew, and red; He thought no shame all the day long To wear the bags of bread. 15 Then he put on the old man's breeks, Was patchd from ballup to side; ‘By the truth of my body,’ bold Robin can say, ‘This man lovd little pride.’ 16 Then he put on the old man's hose, Were patchd from knee to wrist; ‘By the truth of my body,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘I'd laugh if I had any list.’ 17 Then he put on the old man's shoes, Were patchd both beneath and aboon; Then Robin Hood swore a solemn oath, It's good habit that makes a man. 18 Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone, With a link a down and a down, And there he met with the proud sheriff, Was walking along the town. 19 ‘O save, O save, O sheriff,’ he said, ‘O save, and you may see! And what will you give to a silly old man To-day will your hangman be?’ 20 ‘Some suits, some suits,’ the sheriff he said, ‘Some suits I'll give to thee; Some suits, some suits, and pence thirteen To-day's a hangman's fee.’ 21 Then Robin he turns him round about, And jumps from stock to stone; ‘By the truth of my body,’ the sheriff he said, ‘That's well jumpt, thou nimble old man.’ 22 ‘I was neer a hangman in all my life, Nor yet intends to trade; But curst be he,’ said bold Robin, ‘That first a hangman was made. 23 ‘I've a bag for meal, and a bag for malt, And a bag for barley and corn; A bag for bread, and a bag for beef, And a bag for my little small horn. 24 ‘I have a horn in my pocket, I got it from Robin Hood, And still when I set it to my mouth, For thee it blows little good.’ 25 ‘O wind thy horn, thou proud fellow, Of thee I have no doubt; I wish that thou give such a blast Till both thy eyes fall out.’ 26 The first loud blast that he did blow, He blew both loud and shrill; A hundred and fifty of Robin Hood's men Came riding over the hill. 27 The next loud blast that he did give, He blew both loud and amain, And quickly sixty of Robin Hood's men Came shining over the plain. 28 ‘O who are yon,’ the sheriff he said, ‘Come tripping over the lee?’ ‘The're my attendants,’ brave Robin did say, ‘They'll pay a visit to thee.’ 29 They took the gallows from the slack, They set it in the glen, They hangd the proud sheriff on that, Releasd their own three men.

Or do you weep for your maidenhead, That is taken from your body?’ 3 ‘I weep not for gold,’ the lady replyed, ‘Neither do I weep for fee; Nor do I weep for my maidenhead, That is taken from my body.’ 4 ‘What weep you for then?’ said jolly Robin, ‘I prithee come tell unto me;’ ‘Oh! I do weep for my three sons, For they are all condemned to die.’ 5 ‘What church have they robbed?’ said jolly Robin, ‘Or parish-priest have they slain? What maids have they forced against their will? Or with other men's wives have lain?’ 6 ‘No church have they robbd,’ this lady replied, ‘Nor parish-priest have they slain; No maids have they forc'd against their will, Nor with other men's wives have lain.’ 7 ‘What have they done then?’ said jolly Robin, ‘Come tell me most speedily:’ ‘Oh! it is for killing the king's fallow deer, And they are all condemned to die.’ 8 ‘Get you home, get you home,’ said jolly Robin, ‘Get you home most speedily, And I will unto fair Nottingham go, For the sake of the squires all three.’ 9 Then bold Robin Hood for Nottingham goes, For Nottingham town goes he, O there did he meet with a poor beggar-man, He came creeping along the highway. 10 ‘What news, what news, thou old beggar-man? What news, come tell unto me:’ ‘O there is weeping and wailing in fair Nottingham, For the death of the squires all three.’ 11 This beggar-man had a coat on his back, 'T was neither green, yellow, nor red; Bold Robin Hood thought 'twas no disgrace To be in a beggar-man's stead. 12 ‘Come, pull off thy coat, you old beggar-man, And you shall put on mine; And forty good shillings I'll give thee to boot, Besides brandy, good beer, ale and wine.’ 13 Bold Robin Hood then unto Nottingham came, Unto Nottingham town came he; O there did he meet with great master sheriff, And likewise the squires all three. 14 ‘One boon, one boon,’ says jolly Robin, ‘One boon I beg on my knee; That, as for the deaths of these three squires, Their hangman I may be.’ 15 ‘Soon granted, soon granted,’ says great master sheriff, ‘Soon granted unto thee; And you shall have all their gay cloathing, Aye, and all their white money.’ 16 ‘O I will have none of their gay cloathing, Nor none of their white money, But I'll have three blasts on my bugle-horn, That their souls to heaven may flee.’ 17 Then Robin Hood mounted the gallows so high, Where he blew loud and shrill, Till an hundred and ten of Robin Hood's men They came marching all down the green hill. 18 ‘Whose men are they all these?’ says great master sheriff, ‘Whose men are they? tell unto me:’ ‘O they are mine, but none of thine, And they're come for the squires all three.’ 19 ‘O take them, O take them,’ says great master sheriff, ‘O take them along with thee; For there's never a man in all Nottingham Can do the like of thee.’ 141 ROBIN HOOD RESCUING WILL STUTLY ROBIN HOOD RESCUING WILL STUTLY a.

Will Stutly hanged must be this day, On yonder gallows-tree. 14 ‘O had his noble master known, Hee would some succour send; A few of his bold yeomandree Full soon would fetch him hence.’ 15 ‘I, that is true,’ the young man said; ‘I, that is true,’ said hee; ‘Or, if they were neer to this place, They soon would set him free. 16 ‘But fare thou well, thou good old man, Farewell, and thanks to thee; If Stutly hanged be this day, Revengd his death will be.’ 17 He was no sooner from the palmer gone, But the gates was opened wide, And out of the castle Will Stutly came, Guarded on every side. 18 When hee was forth from the castle come, And saw no help was nigh, Thus he did say unto the sheriff, Thus he said gallantly: 19 Now seeing that I needs must die, Grant me one boon, says he; For my noble master nere had man That yet was hangd on the tree. 20 Give me a sword all in my hand, And let mee be unbound, And with thee and thy men I'le fight, Vntill I lie dead on the ground. 21 But his desire he would not grant, His wishes were in vain; For the sheriff had sworn he hanged should be, And not by the sword be slain. 22 ‘Do but unbind my hands,’ he saies, ‘I will no weapons crave, And if I hanged be this day, Damnation let me have.’ 23 ‘O no, O no,’ the sheriff he said, ‘Thou shalt on the gallows die, I, and so shall thy master too, If ever in me it lie.’ 24 ‘O dastard coward!’ Stutly cries, ‘Thou faint-heart pesant slave! If ever my master do thee meet, Thou shalt thy paiment have. 25 ‘My noble master thee doth scorn, And all thy cowardly crew; Such silly imps unable are Bold Robin to subdue.’ 26 But when he was to the gallows come, And ready to bid adiew, Out of a bush leaps Little John, And steps Will Stutly to. 27 ‘I pray thee, Will, before thou die, Of thy dear friends take leave; I needs must borrow him a while, How say you, master sheriff?’ 28 ‘Now, as I live,’ the sheriff he said, ‘That varlet will I know; Some sturdy rebell is that same, Therefore let him not go.’ 29 With that Little John so hastily Away cut Stutly's bands, And from one of the sheriff his men, A sword twicht from his hands. 30 ‘Here, Will, here, take thou this same, Thou canst it better sway; And here defend thy self a while, For aid will come straight way.’ 31 And there they turnd them back to back, In the middle of them that day, Till Robin Hood approached neer, With many an archer gay. 32 With that an arrow by them flew, I wist from Robin Hood; ‘Make haste, make haste,’ the sheriff he said, ‘Make haste, for it is good.’ 33 The sheriff is gone; his doughty men Thought it no boot to stay, But, as their master had them taught, They run full fast away. 34 ‘O stay, O stay,’ Will Stutly said, ‘Take leave ere you depart; You nere will catch bold Robin Hood Vnless you dare him meet.’ 35 ‘O ill betide you,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘That you so soon are gone; My sword may in the scabbord rest, For here our work is done.’ 36 ‘I little thought when I came here, When I came to this place, For to have met with Little John, Or seen my masters face.’ 37 Thus Stutly was at liberty set, And safe brought from his foe; ‘O thanks, O thanks to my master, Since here it was not so.’ 38 ‘And once again, my fellows, We shall in the green woods meet, Where we will make our bow-strings twang, Musick for us most sweet.’ 142 LITTLE JOHN A BEGGING LITTLE JOHN A BEGGING—A Percy MS., p. 20; Hales and Furnivall, I, 47. 1 beggar,’ he sayes, ‘With none such fellows as thee.’ 2 ‘I am not in iest,’ said Litle Iohn, ‘I sweare all by the roode; Change with mee,’ said Little Iohn, ‘And I will giue thee some boote.’ 3 But he has gotten on this old mans gowne, It reacht not to his wrist; ‘Christ's curse on's hart,’ said Litle Iohn, ‘That thinkes my gowne amisse.’ 4 But he has gotten on this old mans shoes, Are clouted nine fold about; ‘Beshrew his hart,’ says Litle Iohn, ‘That bryer or thorne does doubt. 5 ‘Wilt teach me some phrase of thy begging?’ says Iohn; ‘I pray thee, tell it mee, How I may be as beggar-like As any in my companie.’ 6 ‘Thou must goe two foote on a staffe, The third vpon a tree; Full loud that thou must cry and fare, When nothing ayleth thee.’ 7 But Iohn he walket the hills soe high, Soe did [he] the hills soe browne; The ready way that he cold take Was towards Nottingham towne. 8 But as he was on the hills soe high, He mett with palmers three; Sayes, God you saue, my brethren all, Now God you saue and see! 9 This seuen yeere I haue you sought; Before I cold neuer you see!

What news?’ then said Robin Hood, ‘Come, Little John, tell unto me; How hast thou sped with thy beggers trade? For that I fain would see.’ 20 ‘No news but good,’ then said Little John, ‘With begging ful wel I have sped; Six hundred and three I have here for thee, In silver and gold so red.’ 21 Then Robin took Little John by the hand, And danced about the oak-tree: ‘If we drink water while this doth last, Then an il death may we die!’ 22 So to conclude my merry new song, All you that delight it to sing, 'Tis of Robin Hood, that archer good, And how Little John went a begging. 143 ROBIN HOOD AND THE BISHOP Robin Hood and the Bishop a.

An arrow I will at her let flie, So like an old witch looks she.’ 13 ‘O hold thy hand, hold thy hand,’ said Robin then, ‘And shoot not thy arrows so keen; I am Robin Hood, thy master good, And quickly it shall be seen.’ 14 The Bishop he came to the old womans house, And he called with furious mood, ‘Come let me soon see, and bring unto me, That traitor Robin Hood.’ 15 The old woman he set on a milk-white steed, Himselfe on a dapple-gray, And for joy he had got Robin Hood, He went laughing all the way. 16 But as they were riding the forrest along, The Bishop he chanc'd for to see A hundred brave bow-men bold Stand under the green-wood tree. 17 ‘O who is yonder,’ the Bishop then said, ‘That's ranging within yonder wood?’ ‘Marry,’ says the old woman, ‘I think it to be A man calld Robin Hood.’ 18 ‘Why, who art thou,’ the Bishop he said, ‘Which I have here with me?’ ‘Why, I am an old woman, thou cuckoldly bishop; Lift up my leg and see.’ 19 ‘Then woe is me,’ the Bishop he said, ‘That ever I saw this day!’ He turnd him about, but Robin so stout Calld him, and bid him stay. 20 Then Robin took hold of the Bishops horse, And ty'd him fast to a tree; Then Little John smil'd his master upon, For joy of that company. 21 Robin Hood took his mantle from's back, And spread it upon the ground, And out of the Bishops portmantle he Soon told five hundred pound. 22 ‘So now let him go,’ said Robin Hood; Said Little John, That may not be; For I vow and protest he shall sing us a mass Before that he goe from me. 23 Then Robin Hood took the Bishop by the hand, And bound him fast to a tree, And made him sing a mass, God wot, To him and his yeomandree. 24 And then they brought him through the wood, And set him on his dapple-gray, And gave the tail within his hand, And bade him for Robin Hood pray. 144 ROBIN HOOD AND THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford ROBIN HOOD AND THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD—A a.

Or why do you kill the king's venson, When your company is so few?’ 7 ‘We are shepherds,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘And we keep sheep all the year, And we are disposed to be merry this day, And to kill of the king's fat deer.’ 8 ‘You are brave fellows!’ said the Bishop, ‘And the king of your doings shall know; Therefore make haste and come along with me, For before the king you shall go.’ 9 ‘O pardon, O pardon,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘O pardon, I thee pray! For it becomes not your lordship's coat To take so many lives away.’ 10 ‘No pardon, no pardon,’ says the Bishop, ‘No pardon I thee owe; Therefore make haste, and come along with me, For before the king you shall go.’ 11 Then Robin set his back against a tree, And his foot against a thorn, And from underneath his shepherd's coat He pulld out a bugle-horn. 12 He put the little end to his mouth, And a loud blast did he blow, Till threescore and ten of bold Robin's men Came running all on a row; 13 All making obeysance to bold Robin Hood; 'Twas a comely sight for to see: ‘What is the matter, master,’ said Little John, ‘That you blow so hastily?’ 14 ‘O here is the Bishop of Hereford, And no pardon we shall have:’ ‘Cut off his head, master,’ said Little John, ‘And throw him into his grave.’ 15 ‘O pardon, O pardon,’ said the Bishop, ‘O pardon, I thee pray! For if I had known it had been you, I'd have gone some other way.’ 16 ‘No pardon, no pardon,’ said Robin Hood, ‘No pardon I thee owe; Therefore make haste and come along with me, For to merry Barnsdale you shall go.’ 17 Then Robin he took the Bishop by the hand, And led him to merry Barnsdale; He made him to stay and sup with him that night, And to drink wine, beer, and ale. 18 ‘Call in the reckoning,’ said the Bishop, ‘For methinks it grows wondrous high:’ ‘Lend me your purse, Bishop,’ said Little John, ‘And I'll tell you bye and bye.’ 19 Then Little John took the bishop's cloak, And spread it upon the ground, And out of the bishop's portmantua He told three hundred pound. 20 ‘Here's money enough, master,’ said Little John, ‘And a comely sight't is to see; It makes me in charity with the Bishop, Tho he heartily loveth not me.’ 21 Robin Hood took the Bishop by the hand, And he caused the music to play, And he made the Bishop to dance in his boots, And glad he could so get away. ROBIN HOOD AND THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD—B E. Cochrane's Song-Book, p. 149, No 113. 1 Some talk of lords, and some talk of lairds, And some talk of barrons bold, But I'll tell you a story of bold Robin Hood, How he robbed the Bishop of his gold. 2 ‘Cause kill us a venison,’ sayes Robin Hood, ‘And we'll dress it by the high-way side, And we will watch narrowly for the Bishop, Lest some other way he do ride.’ 3 ‘Now who is this,’ sayes the Bishop, ‘That makes so boldly here To kill the king's poor small venison, And so few of his company here?’ 4 ‘We are shepherds,’ says Robin Hood, ‘And do keep sheep all the year; And we thought it fit to be merry on a day, And kill one of the king's fallow deer.’ 5 ‘Thou art a bold fellow,’ the Bishop replyes, ‘And your boldness you do show; Make hast, make hast, and go along with me, For the king of your doings shall know.’ 6 He leand his back unto a brae, His foot against a thorn, And out from beneath his long shepherds coat He pulled a blowing-horn. 7 He put his horn in to his mouth, And a snell blast he did blow, Till four and twenty of bold Robins men Came riding up all in a row. 8 ‘Come, give us a reckoning,’ says the Bishop, ‘For I think you drink wondrous large:’ ‘Come, give me your purse,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘And I will pay all your charge.’ 9 He pulled off his long shepherds coat, And he spread it on the ground, And out of the Bishops long trunk-hose, He pulled a hundred pound. 10 ‘O master,’ quoth Litle John, ‘It's a very bony sight for to see; It makes me to favour the Bishop, Tho in heart he loves not me.’ 11 ‘Come, sing us a mass,’ sayes bold Robin Hood, ‘Come, sing us a mass all anon; Come, sing us a mass,’ sayes bold Robin Hood, ‘Take a kick in the a?se, and be gone.’ 145 ROBIN HOOD AND QUEEN KATHERINE Robin Hoode and Quene Kath[erine] ROBIN HOOD AND QUEEN KATHERINE—A Percy MS., p. 15; Hales and Furnivall, I, 37. 1 Now list you, lithe you, gentlemen, A while for a litle space, And I shall tell you how Queene Katterine Gott Robin Hood his grace. 2 Gold taken from the kings harbengers Seldome times hath beene seene, 3 ‘Queene Katherine, I say to thee;’ ‘That's a princly wager,’ quoth Queene Katherine, ‘Betweene your grace and me. 4 ‘Where must I haue mine archers?’ says Queene Katherine; ‘You haue the flower of archery:’ ‘Now take your choice, dame,’ he sayes, ‘Thorow out all England free. 5 ‘Yea from North Wales to Westchester, And also to Couentry; And when you haue chosen the best you can, The wager must goe with mee.’ 6 ‘If that prooue,’ says Queene Katherine, ‘Soone that wilbe tride and knowne; Many a man counts of another mans pursse, And after looseth his owne.’ 7 The queene is to her palace gone, To her page thus shee can say: Come hither to me, Dicke Patrinton, Trusty and trew this day. 8 Thou must bring me the names of my archers all, All strangers must they bee, Yea from North Wales to West Chester, And alsoe to Couentrie. 9 Commend me to Robin Hood, says Queene Katherine, And alsoe to Litle John, And specially to Will Scarlett, Ffryar Tucke and Maid Marryan. 10 Robin Hood we must call Loxly, And Little John the Millers sonne; Thus wee then must change their names, They must be strangers euery one. 11 Commend mee to Robin Hood, sayes Queene Katherine, And marke, page, what I say; In London they must be with me [Vpon S? Georges day.] 12 ‘These words hath sent by me; Att London you must be with her Vpon S? Georg[e]s day. 13 ‘Vpon S?

Down a down a down 2 ‘If that I live a year to an end,’ Thus gan Queen Katherin say, ‘Bold Robin Hood, I will be thy friend, And all thy yeomen gay.’ 3 The queen is to her chamber gone, As fast as she can wen; She cals unto her her lovely page, His name was Richard Patringten. 4 ‘Come hither to mee, thou lovely page, Come thou hither to mee; For thou must post to Notingham, As fast as thou canst dree. 5 ‘And as thou goest to Notingham, Search all those English wood; Enquire of one good yeoman or another That can tell thee of Robin Hood.’ 6 Sometimes he went, sometimes hee ran, As fast as he could win; And when hee came to Notingham, There he took up his inne. 7 And when he came to Notingham, And had took up his inne, He calls for a pottle of Renish wine, And drank a health to his queen. 8 There sat a yeoman by his side; ‘Tell mee, sweet page,’ said hee, ‘What is thy business or the cause, So far in the North Country?’ 9 ‘This is my business and the cause, Sir, I'le tell it you for good, To inquire of one good yeoman or another To tell mee of Robin Hood.’ 10 ‘I'le get my horse betime in the morn, By it be break of day, And I will shew thee bold Robin Hood, And all his yeomen gay.’ 11 When that he came at Robin Hoods place, Hee fell down on his knee: ‘Queen Katherine she doth greet you well, She greets you well by mee. 12 ‘She bids you post to fair London court, Not fearing any thing; For there shall be a little sport, And she hath sent you her ring.’ 13 Robin took his mantle from his back — It was of the Lincoln green — And sent it by this lovely page, For a present unto the queen. 14 In summer time, when leaves grow green, It is a seemly sight to see How Robin Hood himself had drest, And all his yeomandry. 15 He cloathed his men in Lincoln green, And himself in scarlet red, Black hats, white feathers, all alike; Now bold Robin Hood is rid. 16 And when he came at Londons court, Hee fell downe on his knee: ‘Thou art welcome, Locksly,’ said the queen, ‘And all thy good yeomendree.’ 17 The king is into Finsbury field, Marching in battel ray, And after follows bold Robin Hood, And all his yeomen gay. 18 ‘Come hither, Tepus,’ said the king, ‘Bow-bearer after mee, Come measure mee out with this line How long our mark shall be.’ 19 ‘What is the wager?’ said the queen, ‘That must I now know here:’ ‘Three hundred tun of Renish wine, Three hundred tun of beer. 20 ‘Three hundred of the fattest harts That run on Dallom lee; That's a princely wager,’ said the king, ‘That needs must I tell thee.’ 21 With that bespake one Clifton then, Full quickly and full soon; ‘Measure no mark for us, most soveraign leige, Wee'l shoot at sun and moon.’ 22 ‘Ful fifteen score your mark shall be, Ful fifteen score shall stand;’ ‘I'le lay my bow,’ said Clifton then, ‘I'le cleave the willow wand.’ 23 With that the kings archers led about, While it was three and none; With that the ladies began to shout, Madam, your game is gone! 24 ‘A boon, a boon,’ Queen Katherine cries, ‘I crave on my bare knee; Is there any knight of your privy counsel Of Queen Katherines part will be? 25 ‘Come hither to mee, Sir Richard Lee, Thou art a knight full good; For I do know by thy pedigree Thou springst from Goweres blood. 26 ‘Come hither to me, thou Bishop of Hereford-shire’ — For a noble priest was he — ‘By my silver miter,’ said the bishop then, ‘I'le not bet one peny. 27 ‘The king hath archers of his own, Full ready and full light, And these be strangers every one, No man knows what they height.’ 28 ‘What wilt thou bet,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Thou seest our game the worse?’ ‘By my silver miter,’ said the bishop then, ‘All the mony within my purse.’ 29 ‘What is in thy purse?’ said Robin Hood, ‘Throw it down on the ground;’ ‘Fifteen score nobles,’ said the bishop then, ‘It's neer an hundred pound.’ 30 Robin Hood took his bagge from his side, And threw it down on the green; William Scadlocke went smiling away, ‘I know who this mony must win.’ 31 With that the queens archers led about, While it was three and three; With that the ladies gave a shout, ‘Woodcock, beware thyn ee!’ 32 ‘It is three and three, now,’ said the king, ‘The next three pays for all;’ Robin Hood went and whispered to the queen, ‘The kings part shall be but small.’ 33 Robin Hood he led about, He shot it under hand, And Clifton, with a bearing arrow, He clave the willow wand. 34 And little Midge, the Miller's son, Hee shot not much the worse; He shot within a finger of the prick; ‘Now, bishop, beware thy purse!’ 35 ‘A boon, a boon,’ Queen Katherine cries, ‘I crave on my bare knee, — That you will angry be with none That is of my party.’ 36 ‘They shall have forty days to come, And forty days to go, And three times forty to sport and play; Then welcome friend or fo.’ 37 ‘Then thou art welcome, Robin Hood,’ said the queen, ‘And so is Little John, So is Midge, the Miller's son; Thrice welcome every one.’ 38 ‘Is this Robin Hood?’ the king now said; ‘For it was told to mee That he was slain in the pallace-gate, So far in the North Country.’ 39 ‘Is this Robin Hood,’ said the bishop then, ‘As I see well to be? Had I knowne that had been that bold outlaw, I would not have bet one peny. 40 ‘Hee took me late one Saturday at night, And bound mee fast to a tree, And made mee sing a mass, God wot, To him and his yeomendree.’ 41 ‘What and if I did?’ says Robin Hood, ‘Of that mass I was full fain; For recompense to thee,’ he says, ‘Here's half thy gold again.’ 42 ‘Now nay, now nay,’ saies Little John, ‘Master, that shall not be; We must give gifts to the kings officers; That gold will serve thee and mee.’ Robin Hood, Scarlet and John ROBIN HOOD AND QUEEN KATHERINE—C The Garland of 1663, No 1. 1 Stout Robin Hood, a most lusty out-law, As ever yet lived in this land, As ever yet lived in this land. His equal I'm sure you never yet saw, So valiant was he of his hand, So valiant was he of his hand. 2 No archers could ever compare with these three, Although from us they are gone; The like was never, nor never will be, To Robin Hood, Scarlet and John. 3 Many stout robberies by these men were done, Within this our kingdom so wide; Vpon the highway much treasure they have won, No one that his purse ere deny'd. 4 Great store of money they from the kings men Couragiously did take away; Vnto fair Queen Katherine they gave it again, Who to them these words did say. 5 If that I live but another fair year, Kind Robin Hood, said the fair queen, The love for this courtesie that I thee bear, Assure thy self it shall be seen. 6 Brave Robin Hood courteously thanked her Grace, And so took his leave of the queen; He with his bold archers then hied him apace, In summer time, to the woods green. 7 ‘Now wend we together, my merry men all, To the green wood to take up our stand:’ These archers were ready at Robin Hoods call, With their bent bows all in their hand. 8 ‘Come, merrily let us now valiantly go With speed unto the green wood, And there let us kill a stout buck or a do, For our master, Robin Hood.’ 9 At London must now be a game of shooting, Where archers should try their best skill; It was so commanded by their gracious king; The queen then thought to have her will. 10 Her little foot-page she sent with all speed, To find out stout Robin Hood, Who in the North bravely did live, as we read, With his bow-men in the green wood. 11 When as this young page unto the North came, He staid under a hill at his inn; Within the fair town of sweet Nottingham, He there to enquire did begin. 12 The page then having enquired aright The way unto Robin Hoods place, As soon as the page had obtained of him sight, He told him strange news from her Grace. 13 ‘Her Majestie praies you to haste to the court,’ And therewithall shewd him her ring; We must not delay his swift haste to this sport, Which then was proclaimd by the king. 14 Then Robin Hood hies him with all speed he may, With his fair men attired in green, And towards fair London he then takes his way; His safety lay all on the queen. 15 Now Robin Hood welcome was then to the court, Queen Katharine so did allow; Now listen, my friends, and my song shal report How the queen performed her vow. 16 The king then went marching in state with his peers To Finsbury field most gay, Where Robin Hood follows him, void of all fears, With his lusty brave shooters that day. 17 The king did command that the way should be Straight mete with a line that was good; The answer was made to him presently, By lusty bold Robin Hood. 18 ‘Let there be no mark measured,’ then said he soon; ‘I,’ so said Scarlet and John, ‘For we will shoot to the sun or the moon; We scorn to be outreacht with none.’ 19 ‘What shall the wager be?’ then said the queen, ‘Pray tell me before you begin:’ ‘Three hundred tuns of good wine shall be seen, And as much of strong bear for to win. 20 ‘Three hundred of lusty fat bucks, sweet, beside, Shall now be our royal lay:’ Quoth Robin Hood, What ere does betide, I'le bear this brave purchase away. 21 ‘Full fifteenscore,’ saith the king, ‘it shall be;’ Then straight did the bow-men begin, And Robin Hoods side gave them leave certainly A while some credit to win. 22 The royal queen Katharine aloud cried she, Is here no lord, nor yet knight, That will take my part in this bold enmity? Sir Robert Lee, pray do me right. 23 Then to the bold Bishop of Herefordshire Most mildly spoke our good queen; But he straight refused to lay any more, Such ods on their parties were seen. 24 ‘What wilt thou bet, seeing our game is the worse?’ Unto him then said Robin Hood: ‘Why then,’ quoth the bishop, ‘all that's in my purse;’ Quoth Scarlet, That bargain is good. 25 ‘A hundred good pounds there is in the same,’ The bishop unto him did say; Then said Robin Hood, Now here's for the game, And to bear this your money away. 26 Then did the kings archer his arrows command Most bravely and with great might, But brave jolly Robin shot under his hand, And then did hit the mark right. 27 And Clifton he then, with his arrow so good, The willow-wood cleaved in two; The Miller's young son came not short, by the rood, His skill he most bravely did show. 28 Thus Robin Hood and his crew won the rich prize, From all archers that there could be; Then loudly unto the king Queen Katherine cries, Forgive all my company! 29 The king then did say, that for forty daies, Free leave then to come or go, For any man there, though he got the praise, ‘Be he friend,’ quoth he, ‘or be he foe.’ 30 Then quoth the queen, Welcome thou art, Robin Hood, And welcome, brave bow-men all three; Then straight quoth the king, I did hear, by the rood, That slain he was in the countrey. 31 ‘Is this Robin Hood?’ the bishop did say, ‘Is this Robin Hood certainly? He made me to say him mass last Saturday, To him and his bold yeomendry.’ 32 ‘Well,’ quoth Robin Hood, ‘in requital thereof, Half thy gold I give unto thee;’ ‘Nay, nay,’ then said Little John in a scoff, ‘'T will serue us ith’ North Countrey.’ 33 Then Robin Hood pardon had straight of the king, And so had they every one; The fame of these days most loudly does ring, Of Robin Hood, Scarlet and John. 34 Great honours to Robin Hood after were done, As stories for certain do say; The king made him Earl of fair Huntington, Whose fame will never decay. 35 Thus have you heard the fame of these men, Good archers they were every one; We never shal see the like shooters again As Robin Hood, Scarlet and John. 146 ROBIN HOOD'S CHASE ROBIN HOOD'S CHASE a.

Hey down derry derry down 2 But such a tale as this before I think there was never none; For Robin Hood disguised himself, And to the wood is gone. 3 Like to a fryer, bold Robin Hood Was accoutered in his array; With hood, gown, beads and crucifix, He past upon the way. 4 He had not gone [past] miles two or three, But it was his chance to spy Two lusty priests, clad all in black, Come riding gallantly. 5 ‘Benedicete,’ then said Robin Hood, ‘Some pitty on me take; Cross you my hand with a silver groat, For Our dear Ladies sake. 6 ‘For I have been wandring all this day, And nothing could I get; Not so much as one poor cup of drink, Nor bit of bread to eat.’ 7 ‘Now, by my holydame,’ the priests repli'd, ‘We never a peny have; For we this morning have been robd, And could no mony save.’ 8 ‘I am much afraid,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘That you both do tell a lye; And now before that you go hence, I am resolvd to try.’ 9 When as the priests heard him say so, Then they rode away amain; But Robin Hood betook him to his heels, And soon overtook them again. 10 Then Robin Hood laid hold of them both, And pulld them down from their horse: ‘O spare us, fryer!’ the priests cry'd out, ‘On us have some remorse!’ 11 ‘You said you had no mony,’ quoth he, ‘Wherefore, without delay, We three will fall down on our knees, And for mony we will pray.’ 12 The priests they could not him gainsay, But down they kneeled with speed; ‘Send us, O send us,’ then quoth they, ‘Some mony to serve our need.’ 13 The priests did pray with mournful chear, Sometimes their hands did wring, Sometimes they wept and cried aloud, Whilst Robin did merrily sing. 14 When they had been praying an hours space, The priests did still lament; Then quoth bold Robin, Now let's see What mony heaven hath us sent. 15 We will be sharers now all alike Of the mony that we have; And there is never a one of us That his fellows shall deceive. 16 The priests their hands in their pockets put, But mony would find none: ‘We'l search our selves,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Each other, one by one.’ 17 Then Robin Hood took pains to search them both, And he found good store of gold; Five hundred peeces presently Vpon the grass was told. 18 ‘Here is a brave show,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Such store of gold to see, And you shall each one have a part, Cause you prayed so heartily.’ 19 He gave them fifty pound a-peece, And the rest for himself did keep; The priests durst not speak one word, But they sighed wondrous deep. 20 With that the priests rose up from their knees, Thinking to have parted so; ‘Nay, stay,’ said Robin Hood, ‘one thing more I have to say ere you go. 21 ‘You shall be sworn,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘Vpon this holy grass, That you will never tell lies again, Which way soever you pass. 22 ‘The second oath that you here must take, All the days of your lives You never shall tempt maids to sin, Nor lye with other mens wives. 23 ‘The last oath you shall take, it is this, Be charitable to the poor; Say you have met with a holy fryer, And I desire no more.’ 24 He set them upon their horses again, And away then they did ride; And hee returnd to the merry green-wood, With great joy, mirth and pride. 148 THE NOBLE FISHERMAN, OR, ROBIN HOOD'S PREFERMENT THE NOBLE FISHERMAN, OR, ROBIN HOOD'S PREFERMENT a.

Or tell to me, where dost thou fare? ‘I am a poore fisherman,’ saith he then, ‘This day intrapped all in care.’ 7 ‘What is thy name, thou fine fellow? I pray thee heartily tell to me;’ ‘In mine own country where I was borne, Men called me Simon over the Lee.’ 8 ‘Simon, Simon,’ said the good wife, ‘I wish thou maist well brook thy name;’ The outlaw was ware of her courtesie, And rejoycd he had got such a dame. 9 ‘Simon, wilt thou be my man? And good round wages I'le give thee; I have as good a ship of mine owne As any sayle upon the sea. 10 ‘Anchors and planks thou shalt want none, Masts and ropes that are so long;’ ‘And if that you thus furnish me,’ Said Simon, ‘nothing shall goe wrong.’ 11 They pluckt up anchor, and away did sayle, More of a day then two or three; When others cast in their baited hooks, The bare lines into the sea cast he. 12 ‘It will be long,’ said the master then, ‘Ere this great lubber do thrive on the sea; I'le assure you he shall have no part of our fish, For in truth he is of no part worthy.’ 13 ‘O woe is me,’ said Simon then, ‘This day that ever I came here! I wish I were in Plomton Parke, In chasing of the fallow deere. 14 ‘For every clowne laughs me to scorne, And they by me set nought at all; If I had them in Plomton Park, I would set as little by them all.’ 15 They pluckt up anchor, and away did sayle, More of a day then two or three; But Simon spied a ship of warre, That sayld towards them most valourously. 16 ‘O woe is me,’ said the master then, ‘This day that ever I was borne! For all our fish we have got to-day Is every bit lost and forlorne. 17 ‘For your French robbers on the sea, They will not spare of us one man, But carry us to the coast of France, And ligge us in the prison strong.’ 18 But Simon said, Doe not feare them, Neither, master, take you no care; Give me my bent bow in my hand, And never a Frenchman will I spare. 19 ‘Hold thy peace, thou long lubber, For thou art nought but braggs and boast; If I should cast the over-board, There were nothing but a lubber lost.’ 20 Simon grew angry at these words, And so angry then was he That he tooke his bent bow in his hand, And to the ship-hatch goe doth he. 21 ‘Master, tye me to the mast,’ saith he, ‘That at my mark I may stand fair, And give me my bended bow in my hand, And never a Frenchman will I spare.’ 22 He drew his arrow to the very head, And drew it with all might and maine, And straightway, in the twinkling of an eye, Doth the Frenchmans heart the arow gain. 23 The Frenchman fell downe on the ship-hatch, And under the hatches down below; Another Frenchman that him espy'd The dead corps into the sea doth throw. 24 ‘O master, loose me from the mast,’ he said, ‘And for them all take you no care, And give me my bent bow in my hand, And never a Frenchman will I spare.’ 25 Then streight [they] did board the Frenchmans ship, They lying all dead in their sight; They found within the ship of warre Twelve thousand pound of money bright. 26 ‘The one halfe of the ship,’ said Simon then, ‘I'le give to my dame and children small; The other halfe of the ship I'le bestow On you that are my fellowes all.’ 27 But now bespake the master then, For so, Simon, it shall not be; For you have won her with your own hand, And the owner of it you shall bee. 28 ‘It shall be so, as I have said; And, with this gold, for the opprest An habitation I will build, Where they shall live in peace and rest.’ 149 ROBIN HOOD'S BIRTH, BREEDING, VALOR AND MARRIAGE ROBIN HOOD'S BIRTH, BREEDING, VALOR AND MARRIAGE a.

Ay, and then you shall hear anon A very good ballad of bold Robin Hood, And of his man, brave Little John. 2 In Locksly town, in Nottinghamshire, In merry sweet Locksly town, There bold Robin Hood he was born and was bred, Bold Robin of famous renown. 3 The father of Robin a forrester was, And he shot in a lusty long bow, Two north country miles and an inch at a shot, As the Pinder of Wakefield does know. 4 For he brought Adam Bell, and Clim of the Clugh, And William a Clowdesle To shoot with our forrester for forty mark, And the forrester beat them all three. 5 His mother was neece to the Coventry knight, Which Warwickshire men call Sir Guy; For he slew the blue bore that hangs up at the gate, Or mine host of The Bull tells a lye. 6 Her brother was Gamwel, of Great Gamwel Hall, And a noble house-keeper was he, Ay, as ever broke bread in sweet Nottinghamshire, And a squire of famous degree. 7 The mother of Robin said to her husband, My honey, my love, and my dear, Let Robin and I ride this morning to Gamwel, To taste of my brothers good cheer. 8 And he said, I grant thee thy boon, gentle Joan, Take one of my horses, I pray; The sun is a rising, and therefore make haste, For to-morrow is Christmas-day. 9 Then Robin Hoods fathers grey gelding was brought, And sadled and bridled was he; God wot, a blew bonnet, his new suit of cloaths, And a cloak that did reach to his knee. 10 She got on her holiday kirtle and gown, They were of a light Lincoln green; The cloath was homespun, but for colour and make It might a beseemed our queen. 11 And then Robin got on his basket-hilt sword, And his dagger on his tother side, And said, My dear mother, let's haste to be gone, We have forty long miles to ride. 12 When Robin had mounted his gelding so grey, His father, without any trouble, Set her up behind him, and bad her not fear, For his gelding had oft carried double. 13 And when she was settled, they rode to their neighbours, And drank and shook hands with them all; And then Robin gallopt, and never gave ore, Till they lighted at Gamwel Hall. 14 And now you may think the right worshipful squire Was joyful his sister to see; For he kist her and kist her, and swore a great oath, Thou art welcome, kind sister, to me. 15 To-morrow, when mass had been said in the chappel, Six tables were coverd in the hall, And in comes the squire, and makes a short speech, It was, Neighbours, you're welcome all. 16 But not a man here shall taste my March beer, Till a Christmas carrol he sing: Then all clapt their hands, and they shouted and sung, Till the hall and the parlour did ring. 17 Now mustard and braun, roast beef and plumb pies, Were set upon every table: And noble George Gamwel said, Eat and be merry, And drink too, as long as you're able. 18 When dinner was ended, his chaplain said grace, And, ‘Be merry, my friends,’ said the squire; ‘It rains, and it blows, but call for more ale, And lay some more wood on the fire. 19 ‘And now call ye Little John hither to me, For Little John is a fine lad At gambols and juggling, and twenty such tricks As shall make you merry and glad.’ 20 When Little John came, to gambols they went, Both gentleman, yeoman and clown; And what do you think? Why, as true as I live, Bold Robin Hood put them all down. 21 And now you may think the right worshipful squire Was joyful this sight for to see; For he said, Cousin Robin, thou'st go no more home, But tarry and dwell here with me. 22 Thou shalt have my land when I dye, and till then Thou shalt be the staff of my age; ‘Then grant me my boon, dear uncle,’ said Robin, ‘That Little John may be my page.’ 23 And he said, Kind cousin, I grant thee thy boon; With all my heart, so let it be; ‘Then come hither, Little John,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Come hither, my page, unto me. 24 ‘Go fetch me my bow, my longest long bow, And broad arrows, one, two, or three; For when it is fair weather we'll into Sherwood, Some merry pastime to see.’ 25 When Robin Hood came into merry Sherwood, He winded his bugle so clear, And twice five and twenty good yeomen and bold Before Robin Hood did appear. 26 ‘Where are your companions all?’ said Robin Hood, ‘For still I want forty and three;’ Then said a bold yeoman, Lo, yonder they stand, All under a green-wood tree. 27 As that word was spoke, Clorinda came by; The queen of the shepherds was she; And her gown was of velvet as green as the grass, And her buskin did reach to her knee. 28 Her gait it was graceful, her body was straight, And her countenance free from pride; A bow in her hand, and quiver and arrows Hung dangling by her sweet side. 29 Her eye-brows were black, ay, and so was her hair, And her skin was as smooth as glass; Her visage spoke wisdom, and modesty too; Sets with Robin Hood such a lass! 30 Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, whither away? O whither, fair lady, away? And she made him answer, To kill a fat buck; For to-morrow is Titbury day. 31 Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, wander with me A little to yonder green bower; There sit down to rest you, and you shall be sure Of a brace or a lease in an hour. 32 And as we were going towards the green bower, Two hundred good bucks we espy'd; She chose out the fattest that was in the herd, And she shot him through side and side. 33 ‘By the faith of my body,’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘I never saw woman like thee; And comst thou from east, ay, or comst thou from west, Thou needst not beg venison of me. 34 ‘However, along to my bower you shall go, And taste of a forresters meat:’ And when we come thither, we found as good cheer As any man needs for to eat. 35 For there was hot venison, and warden pies cold, Cream clouted, with honey-combs plenty; And the sarvitors they were, beside Little John, Good yeomen at least four and twenty. 36 Clorinda said, Tell me your name, gentle sir; And he said, 'Tis bold Robin Hood: Squire Gamwel's my uncle, but all my delight Is to dwell in the merry Sherwood. 37 For 'tis a fine life, and 'tis void of all strife. ‘So 'tis, sir,’ Clorinda reply'd; ‘But oh,’ said bold Robin, ‘how sweet would it be, If Clorinda would be my bride!’ 38 She blusht at the motion; yet, after a pause Said, Yes, sir, and with all my heart; ‘Then let's send for a priest,’ said Robin Hood, ‘And be married before we do part.’ 39 But she said, It may not be so, gentle sir, For I must be at Titbury feast; And if Robin Hood will go thither with me, I'll make him the most welcome guest. 40 Said Robin Hood, Reach me that buck, Little John, For I'll go along with my dear; Go bid my yeomen kill six brace of bucks, And meet me to-morrow just here. 41 Before we had ridden five Staffordshire miles, Eight yeomen, that were too bold, Bid Robin Hood stand, and deliver his buck; A truer tale never was told. 42 ‘I will not, faith!’ said bold Robin: ‘come, John, Stand to me, and we'll beat em all:’ Then both drew their swords, an so cut em and slasht em That five of them did fall. 43 The three that remaind calld to Robin for quarter, And pitiful John beggd their lives; When John's boon was granted, he gave them good counsel, And so sent them home to their wives. 44 This battle was fought near to Titbury town, When the bagpipes bated the bull; I am king of the fidlers, and sware 'tis a truth, And I call him that doubts it a gull. 45 For I saw them fighting, and fidld the while, And Clorinda sung, Hey derry down! The bumpkins are beaten, put up thy sword, Bob, And now let's dance into the town. 46 Before we came to it, we heard a strange shouting, And all that were in it lookd madly; For some were a bull-back, some dancing a morris, And some singing Arthur-a-Bradly. 47 And there we see Thomas, our justices clerk, And Mary, to whom he was kind; For Tom rode before her, and calld Mary, Madam, And kist her full sweetly behind. 48 And so may your worships. But we went to dinner, With Thomas and Mary and Nan; They all drank a health to Clorinda, and told her Bold Robin Hood was a fine man. 49 When dinner was ended, Sir Roger, the parson Of Dubbridge, was sent for in haste; He brought his mass-book, and he bade them take hands, And he joynd them in marriage full fast. 50 And then, as bold Robin Hood and his sweet bride Went hand in hand to the green bower, The birds sung with pleasure in merry Sherwood, And 'twas a most joyful hour. 51 And when Robin came in the sight of the bower, ‘Where are my yeomen?’ said he; And Little John answered, Lo, yonder they stand, All under the green-wood tree. 52 Then a garland they brought her, by two and by two, And plac'd them upon the bride's head; The music struck up, and we all fell to dance, Till the bride and the groom were a-bed. 53 And what they did there must be counsel to me, Because they lay long the next day, And I had haste home, but I got a good piece Of the bride-cake, and so came away. 54 Now out, alas! I had forgotten to tell ye That marryd they were with a ring; And so will Nan Knight, or be buried a maiden, And now let us pray for the king: 55 That he may get children, and they may get more, To govern and do us some good; And then I'll make ballads in Robin Hood's bower, And sing em in merry Sherwood. 150 ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN Wood, 401, leaf 21 b. 1 A bonny fine maid of a noble degree, With a hey down down a down down Maid Marian calld by name, Did live in the North, of excellent worth, For she was a gallant dame. 2 For favour and face, and beauty most rare, Queen Hellen shee did excell; For Marian then was praisd of all men That did in the country dwell. 3 'Twas neither Rosamond nor Jane Shore, Whose beauty was clear and bright, That could surpass this country lass, Beloved of lord and knight. 4 The Earl of Huntington, nobly born, That came of noble blood, To Marian went, with a good intent, By the name of Robin Hood. 5 With kisses sweet their red lips meet, For shee and the earl did agree; In every place, they kindly imbrace, With love and sweet unity. 6 But fortune bearing these lovers a spight, That soon they were forced to part, To the merry green wood then went Robin Hood, With a sad and sorrowfull heart. 7 And Marian, poor soul, was troubled in mind, For the absence of her friend; With finger in eye, shee often did cry, And his person did much comend. 8 Perplexed and vexed, and troubled in mind, Shee drest her self like a page, And ranged the wood to find Robin Hood, The bravest of men in that age. 9 With quiver and bow, sword, buckler, and all, Thus armed was Marian most bold, Still wandering about to find Robin out, Whose person was better then gold. 10 But Robin Hood, hee himself had disguisd, And Marian was strangly attir'd, That they provd foes, and so fell to blowes, Whose vallour bold Robin admir'd. 11 They drew out their swords, and to cutting they went, At least an hour or more, That the blood ran apace from bold Robins face, And Marian was wounded sore. 12 ‘O hold thy hand, hold thy hand,’ said Robin Hood, ‘And thou shalt be one of my string, To range in the wood with bold Robin Hood, To hear the sweet nightingall sing.’ 13 When Marian did hear the voice of her love, Her self shee did quickly discover, And with kisses sweet she did him greet, Like to a most loyall lover. 14 When bold Robin Hood his Marian did see, Good lord, what clipping was there! With kind imbraces, and jobbing of faces, Providing of gallant cheer. 15 For Little John took his bow in his hand, And wandring in the wood, To kill the deer, and make good chear, For Marian and Robin Hood. 16 A stately banquet the[y] had full soon, All in a shaded bower, Where venison sweet they had to eat, And were merry that present hour. 17 Great flaggons of wine were set on the board, And merrily they drunk round Their boules of sack, to strengthen the back, Whilst their knees did touch the ground. 18 First Robin Hood began a health To Marian his onely dear, And his yeomen all, both comly and tall, Did quickly bring up the rear. 19 For in a brave veine they tost off the[ir] bouls, Whilst thus they did remain, And every cup, as they drunk up, They filled with speed again. 20 At last they ended their merryment, And went to walk in the wood, Where Little John and Maid Marian Attended on bold Robin Hood. 21 In sollid content together they livd, With all their yeomen gay; They livd by their hands, without any lands, And so they did many a day. 22 But now to conclude, an end I will make In time, as I think it good, For the people that dwell in the North can tell Of Marian and bold Robin Hood. 151 THE KING'S DISGUISE, AND FRIENDSHIP WITH ROBIN HOOD THE KING'S DISGUISE, AND FRIENDSHIP WITH ROBIN HOOD a.

Hang care, the town's our own!’ 38 ‘What's that Robin Hood?’ then said the sheriff; ‘That varlet I do hate; Both me and mine he causd to dine, And servd us all with one plate.’ 39 ‘Ho, ho,’ said Robin, ‘I know what you mean; Come, take your gold again; Be friends with me, and I with thee, And so with every man. 40 ‘Now, master sheriff, you are paid, And since you are beginner, As well as you give me my due; For you neer paid for that dinner. 41 ‘But if that it should please the king So much your house to grace To sup with you, for to speak true, [I] know you neer was base.’ 42 The sheriff could not [that] gain say, For a trick was put upon him; A supper was drest, the king was guest, But he thought 'twould have undone him. 43 They are all gone to London court, Robin Hood, with all his train; He once was there a noble peer, And now he's there again. 44 Many such pranks brave Robin playd While he lived in the green wood: Now, my friends, attend, and hear an end Of honest Robin Hood. 152 ROBIN HOOD AND THE GOLDEN ARROW ROBIN HOOD AND THE GOLDEN ARROW a.

The law is in force, go take thy course Of them that injure thee. 4 ‘Go get thee gone, and by thyself Devise some tricking game For to enthral yon rebels all; Go take thy course with them.’ 5 So away the sheriff he returnd, And by the way he thought Of the words of the king, and how the thing To pass might well be brought. 6 For within his mind he imagined That when such matches were, Those outlaws stout, without [all] doubt, Would be the bowmen there. 7 So an arrow with a golden head And shaft of silver white, Who won the day should bear away For his own proper right. 8 Tidings came to brave Robin Hood, Under the green-wood tree: ‘Come prepare you then, my merry men, We'll go yon sport to see.’ 9 With that stept forth a brave young man, David of Doncaster: ‘Master,’ said he, ‘be ruld by me, From the green-wood we'll not stir. 10 ‘To tell the truth, I'm well informed Yon match is a wile; The sheriff, I wiss, devises this Us archers to beguile.’ 11 ‘O thou smells of a coward,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Thy words does not please me; Come on't what will, I'll try my skill At yon brave archery.’ 12 O then bespoke brave Little John: Come, let us thither gang; Come listen to me, how it shall be That we need not be kend. 13 Our mantles, all of Lincoln green, Behind us we will leave; We'll dress us all so several They shall not us perceive. 14 One shall wear white, another red, One yellow, another blue; Thus in disguise, to the exercise We'll gang, whateer ensue. 15 Forth from the green-wood they are gone, With hearts all firm and stout, Resolving [then] with the sheriff's men To have a hearty bout. 16 So themselves they mixed with the rest, To prevent all suspicion; For if they should together hold They thought [it] no discretion. 17 So the sheriff looking round about, Amongst eight hundred men, But could not see the sight that he Had long expected then. 18 Some said, If Robin Hood was here, And all his men to boot, Sure none of them could pass these men, So bravely they do shoot. 19 ‘Ay,’ quoth the sheriff, and scratchd his head, ‘I thought he would have been here; I thought he would, but, tho he's bold, He durst not now appear.’ 20 O that word grieved Robin Hood to the heart; He vexëd in his blood; Eer long, thought he, thou shalt well see That here was Robin Hood. 21 Some cried, Blue jacket! another cried, Brown! And the third cried, Brave Yellow! But the fourth man said, Yon man in red In this place has no fellow. 22 For that was Robin Hood himself, For he was cloathd in red; At every shot the prize he got, For he was both sure and dead. 23 So the arrow with the golden head And shaft of silver white Brave Robin Hood won, and bore with him For his own proper right. 24 These outlaws there, that very day, To shun all kind of doubt, By three or four, no less no more, As they went in came out. 25 Until they all assembled were Under the green-wood shade, Where they report, in pleasant sport, What brave pastime they made. 26 Says Robin Hood, All my care is, How that yon sheriff may Know certainly that it was I That bore his arrow away. 27 Says Little John, My counsel good Did take effect before, So therefore now, if you'll allow, I will advise once more. 28 ‘Speak on, speak on,’ said Robin Hood, ‘Thy wit's both quick and sound; [I know no man amongst us can For wit like thee be found.’] 29 ‘This I advise,’ said Little John; ‘That a letter shall be pend, And when it is done, to Nottingham You to the sheriff shall send.’ 30 ‘That is well advised,’ said Robin Hood, ‘But how must it be sent?’ ‘Pugh! when you please, it's done with ease, Master, be you content. 31 ‘I'll stick it on my arrow's head, And shoot it into the town; The mark shall show where it must go, When ever it lights down.’ 32 The project it was full performd; The sheriff that letter had; Which when he read, he scratchd his head, And rav'd like one that's mad. 33 So we'll leave him chafing in his grease, Which will do him no good; Now, my friends, attend, and hear the end Of honest Robin Hood. 153 ROBIN HOOD AND THE VALIANT KNIGHT ROBIN HOOD AND THE VALIANT KNIGHT a.

Hey, etc. 2 Therefore they called a council of state, To know what was best to be done For to quell their pride, or else, they reply'd, The land would be over-run. 3 Having consulted a whole summers day, At length it was agreed That one should be sent to try the event, And fetch him away with speed. 4 Therefore a trusty and worthy knight The king was pleasd to call, Sir William by name; when to him he came, He told him his pleasure all. 5 ‘Go you from hence to bold Robin Hood, And bid him, without more a-do, Surrender himself, or else the proud elf Shall suffer with all his crew. 6 ‘Take here a hundred bowmen brave, All chosen men of might, Of excellent art for to take thy part, In glittering armour bright.’ 7 Then said the knight, My sovereign liege, By me they shall be led; I'll venture my blood against bold Robin Hood, And bring him alive or dead. 8 One hundred men were chosen straight, As proper as eer men saw; On Midsummer-day they marched away, To conquer that brave outlaw. 9 With long yew bows and shining spears, They marchd in mickle pride, And never delayd, or halted, or stayd, Till they came to the greenwood-side. 10 Said he to his archers, Tarry here; Your bows make ready all, That, if need should be, you may follow me; And see you observe my call. 11 ‘I'll go in person first,’ he cry'd, ‘With the letters of my good king, Both signd and seald, and if he will yield, We need not draw one string.’ 12 He wanderd about till at length he came To the tent of Robin Hood; The letter he shews; bold Robin arose, And there on his guard he stood. 13 ‘They'd have me surrender,’ quoth bold Robin Hood, ‘And lie at their mercy then; But tell them from me, that never shall be, While I have full seven-score men.’ 14 Sir William the knight, both hardy and bold, Did offer to seize him there, Which William Locksly by fortune did see, And bid him that trick forbear. 15 Then Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth, And blew a blast or twain, And so did the knight, at which there in sight The archers came all amain. 16 Sir William with care he drew up his men, And plac'd them in battle array; Bold Robin, we find, he was not behind; Now this was a bloody fray. 17 The archers on both sides bent their bows, And the clouds of arrows flew; The very first flight, that honoured knight Did there bid the world adieu. 18 Yet nevertheless their fight did last From morning till almost noon; Both parties were stout, and loath to give out; This was on the last [day] of June. 19 At length they went off; one part they went To London with right good will; And Robin Hood he to the green-wood tree, And there he was taken ill. 20 He sent for a monk, who let him blood, And took his life away; Now this being done, his archers they run, It was not a time to stay. 21 Some got on board and crossd the seas, To Flanders, France, and Spain, And others to Rome, for fear of their doom, But soon returnd again. 22 Thus he that never feard bow nor spear Was murderd by letting of blood; And so, loving friends, the story doth end Of valiant bold Robin Hood. 23 There's nothing remains but his epitaph now, Which, reader, here you have; To this very day, and read it you may, As it was upon his grave. Robin Hood's Epitaph, Set on his tomb By the Prioress of Birkslay Monastery, in Yorkshire. Robin, Earl of Huntington, Lies under this little stone. No archer was like him so good; His wildness nam'd him Robin Hood. Full thirteen years, and something more, These northern parts he vexed sore. Such outlaws as he and his men May England never know again! 154 A TRUE TALE OF ROBIN HOOD A TRUE TALE OF ROBIN HOOD Martin Parker's True Tale of Robin Hood was entered to Francis Grove the 29th of February, 1632: Stationers' Registers, Arber, IV, 273. A copy in the British Museum (press-mark C. 39. a. 52), is here reprinted. 1 Both gentlemen, or yeomen bould, Or whatsoever you are, To have a stately story tould, Attention now prepare. 2 It is a tale of Robin Hood, Which I to you will tell, Which being rightly understood, I know will please you well. 3 This Robbin, so much talked on, Was once a man of fame, Instiled Earle of Huntington, Lord Robert Hood by name. 4 In courtship and magnificence, His carriage won him prayse, And greater favour with his prince Than any in his dayes. 5 In bounteous liberality He too much did excell, And loved men of quality More than exceeding well. 6 His great revennues all he sould For wine and costly cheere; He kept three hundred bowmen bold, He shooting lovd so deare. 7 No archer living in his time With him might well compare; He practisd all his youthfull prime That exercise most rare. 8 At last, by his profuse expence, He had consumd his wealth, And being outlawed by his prince, In woods he livd by stealth. 9 The abbot of Saint Maries rich, To whom he mony ought, His hatred to this earle was such That he his downefall wrought. 10 So being outlawed, as 'tis told, He with a crew went forth Of lusty cutters, stout and bold, And robbed in the North. 11 Among the rest, one Little John, A yeoman bold and free, Who could, if it stood him upon, With ease encounter three. 12 One hundred men in all he got, With whom, the story sayes, Three hundred common men durst not Hold combate any wayes. 13 They Yorkshire woods frequented much, And Lancashire also, Wherein their practises were such That they wrought mickle woe. 14 None rich durst travell to and fro, Though nere so strongly armd, But by these theeves, so strong in show, They still were robd and harmd. 15 His chiefest spight to the clergie was, That lived in monstrous pride; No one of them he would let passe Along the high-way side, 16 But first they must to dinner goe, And afterwards to shrift: Full many a one he served so, Thus while he livd by theft. 17 No monkes nor fryers he would let goe, Without paying their fees: If they thought much to be usd so, Their stones he made them leese. 18 For such as they the country filld With bastards in those dayes; Which to prevent, these sparkes did geld All that came by their wayes. 19 But Robbin Hood so gentle was, And bore so brave a minde, If any in distresse did passe, To them he was so kinde 20 That he would give and lend to them, To helpe them at their neede: This made all poore men pray for him, And wish he well might speede. 21 The widdow and the fatherlesse He would send meanes unto, And those whom famine did oppresse Found him a friendly foe. 22 Nor would he doe a woman wrong, But see her safe conveid; He would protect with power strong All those who crav'd his ayde. 23 The abbot of Saint Maries then, Who him undid before, Was riding with two hundred men, And gold and silver store. 24 But Robbin Hood upon him set With his couragious sparkes, And all the coyne perforce did get, Which was twelve thousand markes. 25 He bound the abbot to a tree, And would not let him passe Before that to his men and he His lordship had sayd masse. 26 Which being done, upon his horse He set him fast astride, And with his face towards his ar— He forced him to ride. 27 His men were faine to be his guide, For he rode backward home; The abbot, being thus villifide, Did sorely chafe and fume. 28 Thus Robbin Hood did vindicate His former wrongs receivd; For 'twas this covetous prelate That him of land bereavd. 29 The abbot he rode to the king With all the haste he could, And to his Grace he every thing Exactly did unfold. 30 And sayd if that no course were tane, By force or stratagem, To take this rebell and his traine, No man should passe for them. 31 The king protested by and by Unto the abbot then That Robbin Hood with speed should dye, With all his merry men. 32 But ere the king did any send, He did another feate, Which did his Grace much more offend; The fact indeed was great. 33 For in a short time after that, The kings receivers went Towards London with the coyne they got, For's Highnesse northerne rent. 34 Bold Robbin Hood and Little John, With the rest of their traine, Not dreading law, set them upon, And did their gold obtaine. 35 The king much moved at the same, And the abbots talke also, In this his anger did proclaime, And sent word to and fro, 36 That whosoere, alive or dead, Could bring him Robbin Hood, Should have one thousand markes, well payd In gold and silver good. 37 This promise of the king did make Full many yeomen bold Attempt stout Robbin Hood to take, With all the force they could. 38 But still when any came to him, Within the gay greene wood, He entertainement gave to them, With venison fat and good. 39 And shewd to them such martiall sport, With his long bow and arrow, That they of him did give report, How that it was great sorow, 40 That such a worthy man as he Should thus be put to shift, Being late a lord of high degree, Of living quite bereft. 41 The king, to take him, more and more Sent men of mickle might, But he and his still beate them sore, And conquered them in fight. 42 Or else, with love and courtesie, To him he won their hearts: Thus still he lived by robbery, Throughout the northerne parts. 43 And all the country stood in dread Of Robbin Hood and's men; For stouter lads nere livd by bread, In those dayes nor since then. 44 The abbot which before I nam'd Sought all the meanes he could To have by force this rebell tane, And his adherents bold. 45 Therefore he armd five hundred men, With furniture compleate, But the outlawes slew halfe of them, And made the rest retreate. 46 The long bow and the arrow keene They were so usd unto That still they kept the forest greene, In spight o th' proudest foe. 47 Twelve of the abbots men he tooke, Who came him to have tane, When all the rest the field forsooke; These he did entertaine 48 With banquetting and merriment, And, having usd them well, He to their lord them safely sent, And willd them him to tell 49 That if he would be pleasd at last To beg of our good king That he might pardon what was past, And him to favour bring, 50 He would surrender backe agen The money which before Was taken by him and his men, From him and many more. 51 Poore men might safely passe by him, And some that way would chuse, For well they knew that to helpe them He evermore did use. 52 But where he knew a miser rich, That did the poore oppresse, To feele his coyne his hand did itch; Hee'de have it, more or lesse. 53 And sometimes, when the high-way fayld, Then he his courage rouses; He and his men have oft assayld Such rich men in their houses. 54 So that, through dread of Robbin then And his adventurous crew, The mizers kept great store of men, Which else maintaynd but few. 55 King Richard, of that name the first, Sirnamed Cuer de Lyon, Went to defeate the Pagans curst, Who kept the coasts of Syon. 56 The Bishop of Ely, chancelor, Was left as vice-roy here, Who like a potent emperor Did proudly domminere. 57 Our chronicles of him report That commonly he rode With a thousand horse from court to court, Where he would make abode. 58 He, riding downe towards the north, With his aforesayd traine, Robbin and his did issue forth, Them all to entertaine. 59 And, with the gallant gray-goose wing, They shewed to them such play, That made their horses kicke and fling, And downe their riders lay. 60 Full glad and faine the bishop was, For all his thousand men, To seeke what meanes he could to passe From out of Robbins ken. 61 Two hundred of his men were kil'd, And fourescore horses good; Thirty, who did as captives yeeld, Were carryed to the greene wood. 62 Which afterwards were ransomed, For twenty markes a man; The rest set spurres to horse, and fled To th' town of Warrington. 63 The bishop, sore enraged then, Did, in King Richards name, Muster a power of northerne men, These outlawes bold to tame. 64 But Robbin, with his courtesie, So wonne the meaner sort, That they were loath on him to try What rigor did import. 65 So that bold Robbin and his traine Did live unhurt of them, Vntill King Richard came againe From faire Jerusalem. 66 And then the talke of Robbin Hood His royall eares did fill; His Grace admir'd that ith' greene wood He thus continued still. 67 So that the country farre and neare Did give him great applause; For none of them neede stand in feare, But such as broke the lawes. 68 He wished well unto the king, And prayed still for his health, And never practised any thing Against the common wealth. 69 Onely, because he was undone By th' crewell clergie then, All meanes that he could thinke upon To vexe such kinde of men 70 He enterprized, with hatefull spleene; In which he was to blame, For fault of some, to wreeke his teene On all that by him came. 71 With wealth which he by robbery got Eight almes-houses he built, Thinking thereby to purge the blot Of blood which he had spilt. 72 Such was their blinde devotion then, Depending on their workes; Which, if 'twere true, we Christian men Inferiour were to Turkes. 73 But, to speake true of Robbin Hood, And wrong him not a iot, He never would shed any mans blood That him invaded not. 74 Nor would he iniure husbandmen, That toyld at cart and plough; For well he knew, were 'tnot for them, To live no man knew how. 75 The king in person, with some lords, To Notingham did ride, To try what strength and skill affords To crush these outlawes pride. 76 And, as he once before had done, He did againe proclaime, That whosoere would take upon To bring to Notingham, 77 Or any place within the land, Rebellious Robbin Hood, Should be preferd in place to stand With those of noble blood. 78 When Robbin Hood heard of the same, Within a little space, Into the towne of Notingham A letter to his Grace 79 He shot upon an arrow-head, One evening cunningly; Which was brought to the king, and read Before his Maiestie. 80 The tennour of this letter was That Robbin would submit, And be true leigeman to his Grace, In any thing that's fit, 81 So that his Highnesse would forgive Him and his merry men all; If not, he must i th' greene wood live, And take what chance did fall. 82 The king would faine have pardoned him, But that some lords did say, This president will much condemne Your Grace another day. 83 While that the king and lords did stay Debating on this thing, Some of these outlawes fled away Unto the Scottish king. 84 For they supposd, if he were tane, Or to the king did yeeld, By th' commons all the rest on's traine Full quickely would be quelld. 85 Of more than full a hundred men But forty tarryed still, Who were resolvd to sticke to him, Let fortune worke her will. 86 If none had fled, all for his sake Had got their pardon free; The king to favour meant to take His merry men and he. 87 But ere the pardon to him came, This famous archer dy'd: His death, and manner of the same, I'le presently describe. 88 For, being vext to thinke upon His followers revolt, In melancholly passion He did recount their fault. 89 ‘Perfideous traytors!’ sayd he then, ‘In all your dangers past Have I you guarded as my men To leave me thus at last?’ 90 This sad perplexity did cause A fever, as some say, Which him unto confusion drawes, Though by a stranger way. 91 This deadly danger to prevent, He hide him with all speede Vnto a nunnery, with intent For his healths sake to bleede. 92 A faithlesse fryer did pretend In love to let him blood; But he by falshood wrought the end Of famous Robbin Hood. 93 The fryer, as some say, did this To vindicate the wrong Which to the clergie he and his Had done by power strong. 94 Thus dyed he by trechery, That could not dye by force; Had he livd longer, certainely, King Richard, in remorse, 95 Had unto favour him receavd; He brave men elevated; 'Tis pitty he was of life bereavd By one which he so hated. 96 A treacherous leech this fryer was, To let him bleed to death; And Robbin was, me thinkes, an asse, To trust him with his breath. 97 His corpes the priores of the place, The next day that he dy'd, Caused to be buried, in mean case, Close by the high-way side. 98 And over him she caused a stone To be fixed on the ground; An epitaph was set thereon, Wherein his name was found. 99 The date o th' yeare, and day also, Shee made to be set there, That all who by the way did goe Might see it plaine appeare 100 That such a man as Robbin Hood Was buried in that place; And how he lived in the greene wood, And robd there for a space. 101 It seemes that though the clergie he Had put to mickle woe, He should not quite forgotten be, Although he was their foe. 102 This woman, though she did him hate, Yet loved his memory; And thought it wondrous pitty that His fame should with him dye. 103 This epitaph, as records tell, Within this hundred yeares By many was discerned well, But time all things outweares. 104 His followers, when he was dead, Were some received to grace; The rest to forraigne countries fled, And left their native place. 105 Although his funerall was but meane, This woman had in minde Least his fame should be buried cleane From those that came behind. 106 For certainely, before nor since, No man ere understood, Vnder the reigne of any prince, Of one like Robbin Hood. 107 Full thirteene yeares, and something more, These outlawes lived thus, Feared of the rich, loved of the poore, A thing most marvelous. 108 A thing impossible to us This story seemes to be; None dares be now so venturous; But times are chang'd, we see. 109 We that live in these latter dayes Of civill government, If neede be, have a hundred wayes Such outlawes to prevent. 110 In those dayes men more barbarous were, And lived lesse in awe; Now, God be thanked! people feare More to offend the law. 111 No roaring guns were then in use, They dreampt of no such thing; Our English men in fight did chuse The gallant gray-goose wing. 112 In which activity these men, Through practise, were so good, That in those dayes non equald them, Specially Robbin Hood. 113 So that, it seemes, keeping in caves, In woods and forrests thicke, Thei'd beate a multitude with staves, Their arrowes did so pricke. 114 And none durst neare unto them come, Unlesse in courtesie; All such he bravely would send home, With mirth and iollity. 115 Which courtesie won him such love, As I before have told; 'Twas the cheefe cause that he did prove More prosperous than he could. 116 Let us be thankefull for these times Of plenty, truth and peace, And leave our great and horrid crimes, Least they cause this to cease. 117 I know there's many fained tales Of Robbin Hood and's crew; But chronicles, which seldome fayles, Reports this to be true. 118 Let none then thinke this a lye, For, if 'twere put to th' worst, They may the truth of all discry I th' raigne of Richard the first. 119 If any reader please to try, As I direction show, The truth of this brave history, Hee'l finde it true I know. 120 And I shall thinke my labour well Bestowed, to purpose good, When 'tshall be sayd that I did tell True tales of Robbin Hood. 155 SIR HUGH, OR, THE JEW'S DAUGHTER Hugh of Lincoln SIR HUGH, OR, THE JEW'S DAUGHTER—A Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 151, as taken down by the editor from Mrs Brown's recitation. 1 Four and twenty bonny boys Were playing at the ba, And by it came him sweet Sir Hugh, And he playd oer them a'. 2 He kickd the ba with his right foot, And catchd it wi his knee, And throuch-and-thro the Jew's window He gard the bonny ba flee. 3 He's doen him to the Jew's castell, And walkd it round about; And there he saw the Jew's daughter, At the window looking out. 4 ‘Throw down the ba, ye Jew's daughter, Throw down the ba to me!’ ‘Never a bit,’ says the Jew's daughter, ‘Till up to me come ye.’ 5 ‘How will I come up?

I will not,’ said he, ‘Without my playfellows too.’ 3 She took an apple out of her pocket, And trundled it along the plain, And who was readiest to lift it Was little Sir Hugh again. 4 She took him by the milk-white han, An led him through many a hall, Until they came to one stone chamber, Where no man might hear his call. 5 She set him in a goolden chair, And jaggd him with a pin, And called for a goolden cup To houl his heart's blood in. 6 She tuk him by the yellow hair, An also by the feet, An she threw him in the deep draw-well; It was fifty fadom deep. 7 Day bein over, the night came on, And the scholars all went home; Then every mother had her son, But little Sir Hugh's had none. 8 She put her mantle about her head, Tuk a little rod in her han, An she says, Sir Hugh, if I fin you here, I will bate you for stayin so long. 9 First she went to the Jew's door, But they were fast asleep; An then she went to the deep draw-well, That was fifty fadom deep. 10 She says, Sir Hugh, if you be here, As I suppose you be, If ever the dead or quick arose, Arise and spake to me. 11 ‘Yes, mother dear, I am here, I know I have staid very long; But a little penknife was stuck in my heart, Till the stream ran down full strong. 12 ‘And mother dear, when you go home, Tell my playfellows all That I lost my life by leaving them, When playing that game of ball. 13 ‘And ere another day is gone, My winding-sheet prepare, And bury me in the green churchyard, Where the flowers are bloomin fair. 14 ‘Lay my Bible at my head, My Testament at my feet; The earth and worms shall be my bed, Till Christ and I shall meet.’ SIR HUGH, OR, THE JEW'S DAUGHTER—G a.

O spare my life! O spare my life!’ said he; ‘If ever I live to be a young man, I'll do as good chare for thee.’ 8 ‘I'll do as good chare for thy true love As ever I did for the king; I will scour a basin as bright as silver To let your heart-blood run in.’ 9 When eleven o'clock was past and gone, And all the school-fellows came home, Every mother had her own child But young Sir Hugh's mother had none. 10 She went up Lincoln and down Lincoln, And all about Lincoln street, With her small wand in her right hand, Thinking of her child to meet. 11 She went till she came to the old Jew's gate, She knocked with the ring; Who should be so ready as the old Jew herself To rise and let her in! 12 ‘What news, fair maid? what news, fair maid?

Amen!’ quoth Earl Martial, With a heavy heart then spoke he. 12 ‘The next vile thing that ere I did To you I'll not deny; I made a box of poyson strong, To poyson King Henry.’ 13 ‘That is a vile sin,’ then said the King, ‘God may forgive it thee!’ ‘Amen! Amen!’ quoth Earl Martial, ‘And I wish it so may be.’ 14 ‘The next vile thing that ere I did To you I will discover; I poysoned Fair Rosamond, All in fair Woodstock bower.’ 15 ‘That is a vile sin,’ then said the King, ‘God may forgive it thee!’ ‘Amen! Amen!’ quoth Earl Martial, ‘And I wish it so may be.’ 16 ‘Do you see yonders little boy, A tossing of that ball? That is Earl Martial['s] eldest son, And I love him the best of all. 17 ‘Do you see yonders little boy, A catching of the ball? That is King Henry's son,’ she said, ‘And I love him the worst of all. 18 ‘His head is like unto a bull, His nose is like a boar;’ ‘No matter for that,’ King Henry said, ‘I love him the better therefore.’ 19 The King pulld of his fryar's coat, And appeard all in red; She shriekd and she cry'd, she wrong her hands, And said she was betrayd. 20 The King lookd over his left shoulder, And a grim look looked he, And said, Earl Martial, but for my oath, Then hanged shouldst thou be.

For if I beguile Eleanor our queen, She will gar hang me hie.’ 5 The King he turned him round about, An angry man was he; He's sworn by his sceptre and his sword Earl Marischal should not die. 6 The King has put on a friar's coat, Earl Marischal on another, And they went in before the Queen, Like friars both together. 7 ‘O, if ye be twa friars of France, Ye're dearly welcome to me; But if ye be twa London friars, I will gar hang you hie.’ 8 ‘Twa friars of France, twa friars of France, Twa friars of France are we, And we vow we never spoke to a man Till we spake to Your Majesty.’ 9 ‘The first great sin that eer I did, And I'll tell you it presentlie, Earl Marischal got my maidenhead, When coming oer the sea.’ 10 ‘That was a sin, and a very great sin, But pardoned it may be;’ ‘All that with amendment,’ said Earl Marischal, But a quacking heart had he. 11 ‘The next great sin that eer I did, I'll tell you it presentlie; I carried a box seven years in my breast, To poison King Henrie.’ 12 ‘O that was a sin, and a very great sin, But pardoned it may be;’ ‘All that with amendment,’ said Earl Marischal, But a quacking heart had he. 13 ‘The next great sin that eer I did, I'll tell you it presentlie; I poisoned the Lady Rosamond, And a very good woman was she. 14 ‘See ye not yon twa bonny boys, As they play at the ba?

O swear by the rude that no damage From this shall be gotten or gien!’ 7 ‘I swear by the rude,’ quoth King Henry, ‘No damage shall be gotten or gien; Come, let us spare no cure nor care For the conscience o the Queen.’ 8 ‘O fathers, O fathers, I'm very, very sick, I'm sick, and like to dee; Some ghostly comfort to my poor soul O tell if ye can gie!’ 9 ‘Confess, confess,’ Earl Marshall cried, ‘And you shall pardoned be;’ ‘Confess, confess,’ the King replied, ‘And we shall comfort gie.’ 10 ‘Oh, how shall I tell the sorry, sorry tale!

And she has sent, etc. 2 The King called downe his nobles all, By one, by two, by three: ‘Earl Marshall, I'll go shrive the Queene, And thou shalt wend with mee.’ 3 ‘A boone, a boone!’ quoth Earl Marshall, And fell on his bended knee, ‘That whatsoever the Queene may say, No harm thereof may bee.’ 4 ‘O you'll put on a gray-friar's gowne, And I'll put on another, And we will away to fair London town, Like friars both together.’ 5 ‘O no, O no, my liege, my king, Such things can never bee; For if the Queene hears word of this, Hanged she'll cause me to bee.’ 6 ‘I swear by the sun, I swear by the moon, And by the stars so hie, And by my sceptre and my crowne, The Earl Marshall shall not die.’ 7 The King's put on a gray-friar's gowne, The Earl Marshall's put on another, And they are away to fair London towne, Like fryars both together. 8 When that they came to fair London towne, And came into Whitehall, The bells did ring, and the quiristers sing, And the torches did light them all. 9 And when they came before the Queene, They kneeled down on their knee: ‘What matter, what matter, our gracious queene, You've sent so speedilie?’ 10 ‘O, if you are two fryars of France, It's you that I wished to see; But if you are two English lords, You shall hang on the gallowes-tree.’ 11 ‘O we are not two English lords, But two fryars of France we bee, And we sang the Song of Solomon, As we came over the sea.’ 12 ‘Oh, the first vile sin I did commit Tell it I will to thee; I fell in love with the Earl Marshall, As he brought me over the sea.’ 13 ‘Oh, that was a great sin,’ quoth the King, ‘But pardond it must bee;’ ‘Amen! Amen!’ said the Earl Marshall, With a heavie heart spake hee. 14 ‘Oh, the next sin that I did commit I will to you unfolde; Earl Marshall had my virgin dower, Beneath this cloth of golde.’ 15 ‘Oh, that was a vile sin,’ said the King, ‘May God forgive it thee!’ ‘Amen! Amen!’ groaned the Earl Marshall, And a very frightened man was hee. 16 ‘Oh, the next sin that I did commit Tell it I will to thee; I poisoned a lady of noble blood, For the sake of King Henrie.’ 17 ‘Oh, that was a great sin,’ said the King, ‘But pardoned it shall bee;’ ‘Amen! Amen!’ said the Earl Marshall, And still a frightened man was he. 18 ‘Oh, the next sin that ever I did Tell it I will to thee; I have kept strong poison this seven long years, To poison King Henrie.’ 19 ‘Oh, that was a great sin,’ said the King, ‘But pardoned it must bee;’ ‘Amen!

O yonder is the Earl Marshall's son, And I like him best of all. 21 ‘O don't you see yon other little boy, Playing at the football? O that one is King Henrie's son, And I like him werst of all. 22 ‘His head is like a black bull's head, His feet are like a bear;’ ‘What matter! what matter!’ cried the King, ‘He's my son, and my only heir.’ 23 The King plucked off his fryar's gowne, And stood in his scarlet so red; The Queen she turned herself in bed, And cryed that she was betrayde. 24 The King lookt oer his left shoulder, And a grim look looked he; ‘Earl Marshall,’ he said, ‘but for my oath, Thou hadst swung on the gallowes-tree.’ Earl Marshall QUEEN ELEANOR'S CONFESSION—G “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 4 b, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of William Laidlaw. 1 The queen of England she is seek, And seek and like to dee; She has sent for friers out of France, To bespeek hir speed[i]ly. 2 The king has cald on his merrymen, By thirtys and by threes; Earl Marshall should have been the formest man, But the very last man was he. 3 ‘The queen of England s[h]e is seek, And seek and like to dee, And she has sent for friers out of France, To bespeek hir speedyly. 4 ‘But I will put on a frier's weeg, And ye'l put on another, And we'll away to Queen Helen gaits, Like friers both together.’ 5 ‘O no, no,’ says Earl Marshall, ‘For this it must not be; For if the queen get word of that, High hanged I will be.’ 6 ‘But I will swear by my septer and crown, And by the seas so free, I will swear by my septer and crown, Earl Marshall, thow's no dee.’ 7 So he has put on a frier's wig, And the king has put on another, And they are away to Queen Helen gaits, Like friers both together. 8 When they came to Queen Helen gaits, They tirled at the pin; There was non so ready as the queene herself To open and let them in. 9 ‘O are you two Scottish dogs? — And hanged you shall be — Or are [you] friers come out of France, To bespeek me speedily?’ 10 ‘We are not two Scottish dogs, Nor hanged we shall be; For we have not spoken a wrong word Since we came over the sea.’ 11 ‘Well then, the very first that ever I sind I freely confess to thee; Earl Marshall took my maidenhead Below yon greenwood tree.’ 12 ‘That is a sin, and very great sin, But the Pope will pardon thee;’ ‘Amene, Amene,’ says Earl Marshall, But a feert, feert heart had he. 13 ‘The very next sin that ever I sind I freely confess to thee; I had [poisen] seven years in my breast To poisen King Hendry.’ 14 ‘That is a sin, and very great sin, But the Pope forgiveth thee;’ ‘Amene, Amene,’ says Earl Marshall, But a feert, feert heart had he. 15 ‘The very next sin that ever I sind I freely confess to thee; I poisened one of my court's ladies, Was far more fairer than me.’ 16 ‘That is a sin, and a very great sin, But the Pope forgiveth thee;’ ‘Amene, Amene,’ says Earl Marshall, But a feert, feert heart had he. 17 ‘Do you see yon bony boys, Playing at the baw?

The youngest of them is King Hendry's, And I like him worst of all. 20 ‘Because he is headed like a bull, And his nose is like a boar;’ ‘What is the matter?’ says King Henry, ‘For he shall be my heir.’ 21 Now he put off his frier's wig And drest himself [in] red; She wrung hir hands, and tore hir hair, And s[w]ore she was betraid. 22 ‘Had I not sworn by my septer and crown, And by the seas so free, Had I not sworn by my septer and crown, Earl Marshall, thowst have died.’ 157 GUDE WALLACE On an honourable Achievement of Sir William Wallace, near Falkirk GUDE WALLACE—A A chap-book of Four New Songs and a Prophecy, 1745?

But betwixt me and the English blood I think there is an ill seed sown.’ 2 Wallace him over a river lap, He lookd low down to a linn; He was war of a gay lady Was even at the well washing. 3 ‘Well mot ye fare, fair madam,’ he said, ‘And ay well mot ye fare and see! Have ye any tidings me to tell, I pray you'll show them unto me.’ 4 ‘I have no tidings you to tell, Nor yet no tidings you to ken; But into that hostler's house There's fifteen of your Englishmen. 5 ‘And they are seeking Wallace there, For they've ordained him to be slain:’ ‘O God forbid!’ said Wallace then, ‘For he's oer good a kind Scotsman. 6 ‘But had I money me upon, And evn this day, as I have none, Then would I to that hostler's house, And evn as fast as I could gang.’ 7 She put her hand in her pocket, She told him twenty shillings oer her knee; Then he took off both hat and hood, And thankd the lady most reverently. 8 ‘If eer I come this way again, Well paid [your] money it shall be;’ Then he took off both hat and hood, And he thankd the lady most reverently. 9 He leand him twofold oer a staff, So did he threefold oer a tree, And he's away to the hostler's house, Even as fast as he might dree. 10 When he came to the hostler's house, He said; Good-ben be here! quoth he: An English captain, being deep load, He asked him right cankerdly, 11 Where was you born, thou crooked carle, And in what place, and what country? ‘Tis I was born in fair Scotland, A crooked carle although I be.’ 12 The English captain swore by th' rood, ‘We are Scotsmen as well as thee, And we are seeking Wallace; then To have him merry we should be.’ 13 ‘The man,’ said Wallace, ‘ye're looking for, I seed him within these days three; And he has slain an English captain, And ay the fearder the rest may be.’ 14 ‘I'd give twenty shillings,’ said the captain, ‘To such a crooked carle as thee, If you would take me to the place Where that I might proud Wallace see.’ 15 ‘Hold out your hand,’ said Wallace then, ‘And show your money and be free, For tho you'd bid an hundred pound, I never bade a better bode’ [,said he]. 16 He struck the captain oer the chafts, Till that he never chewed more; He stickd the rest about the board, And left them all a sprawling there. 17 ‘Rise up, goodwife,’ said Wallace then, ‘And give me something for to eat; For it's near two days to an end Since I tasted one bit of meat.’ 18 His board was scarce well covered, Nor yet his dine well scantly dight, Till fifteen other Englishmen Down all about the door did light. 19 ‘Come out, come out,’ said they, ‘Wallace!’ then, ‘For the day is come that ye must die;’ And they thought so little of his might, But ay the fearder they might be. 20 The wife ran but, the gudeman ran ben, It put them all into a fever; Then five he sticked where they stood, And five he trampled in the gutter. 21 And five he chased to yon green wood, He hanged them all out-oer a grain; And gainst the morn at twelve o'clock, He dined with his kind Scottish men.

If ye have ony tidings to tell, I pray cum tell them a' to me.’ 4 ‘I have no tidings you to tell, And as few tidings do I ken; But up and to yon ostler-house Are just gane fifteen gentlemen. 5 ‘They now are seeking Gude Wallace, And ay they're damning him to hang;’ ‘Oh God forbid,’ says Wallace then, ‘I'm sure he is a true Scotsman. 6 ‘Had I but ae penny in my pocket, Or in my company ae baubee, I woud up to yon ostler-house, A' these big gentlemen to see.’ 7 She pat her hand into her pocket, She powd out twenty shillings and three: ‘If eer I live to come this way, Weel payed shall your money be.’ 8 He leaned him twafold oer a staff, Sae did he twafold oer a tree, And he's gane up to the ostler-house, A' these fine gentlemen to see. 9 When he cam up among them a', He bad his benison be there; The captain, being weel buke-learnd, Did answer him in domineer. 10 ‘Where was ye born, ye cruked carl, Or in what town, or what countree?’ ‘O I was born in fair Scotland, A cruked carl although I be.’ 11 The captain sware by the root of his sword, Saying, I'm a Scotsman as weel as thee; Here's twenty shillings of English money To such a cruked carl as thee, If thou'll tell me of that Wallace; He's ay the creature I want to see. 12 ‘O hawd your hand,’ says Wallace then, ‘I'm feard your money be not gude; If't were as muckle and ten times mair, It shoud not bide anither bode.’ 13 He's taen the captain alang the chaps, A wat he never chawed mair; The rest he sticked about the table, And left them a' a sprawling there. 14 ‘Gude wife,’ he said, ‘for my benison, Get up and get my dinner dight; For it is twa days till an end Syne I did taste ane bit of meat.’ 15 Dinner was not weel made ready, Nor yet upon the table set, When fifteen other Englishmen Alighted all about the yate. 16 ‘Come out, come out now, Wallace,’ they say, ‘For this is the day ye are to dee; Ye trust sae mickle in God's might, And ay the less we do fear thee.’ 17 The gude wife ran but, the gude man ran ben, They pat the house all in a swither; Five sune he sticked where he stude, And five he smitherd in a gutter. 18 Five he chac'd to the gude green-wood, And hanged them a' out-oer a pin; And at the morn at eight o'clock He din'd with his men at Lough-mabin.

Between me and my soverign blude I think I see some ill seed sawn.’ 2 Wallace out over yon river he lap, And he has lighted low down on yon plain, And he was aware of a gay ladie, As she was at the well washing. 3 ‘What tydins, what tydins, fair lady?’ he says, ‘What tydins hast thou to tell unto me? What tydins, what tydins, fair lady?’ he says, ‘What tydins hae ye in the south countrie?’ 4 ‘Low down in yon wee ostler-house There is fyfteen Englishmen, And they are seekin for Gude Wallace, It's him to take and him to hang.’ 5 ‘There's nocht in my purse,’ quo Gude Wallace, ‘There's nocht, not even a bare pennie; But I will down to yon wee ostler-house, Thir fyfteen Englishmen to see.’ 6 And when he cam to yon wee ostler-house He bad bendicite be there; 7 ‘Where was ye born, auld crookit carl? Where was ye born, in what countrie?’ ‘I am a true Scot born and bred, And an auld crookit carl just sic as ye see.’ 8 ‘I wad gie fifteen shillings to onie crookit carl, To onie crookit carl just sic as ye, If ye will get me Gude Wallace; For he is the man I wad very fain see.’ 9 He hit the proud captain alang the chafft-blade, That never a bit o meal he ate mair; And he sticket the rest at the table where they sat, And he left them a' lyin sprawlin there. 10 ‘Get up, get up, gudewife,’ he says, ‘And get to me some dinner in haste; For it will soon be three lang days Sin I a bit o meat did taste.’ 11 The dinner was na weel readie, Nor was it on the table set, Till other fifteen Englishmen Were a' lighted about the yett. 12 ‘Come out, come out now, Gude Wallace! This is the day that thou maun die:’ ‘I lippen nae sae little to God,’ he says, ‘Altho I be but ill wordie.’ 13 The gudewife had an auld gudeman; By Gude Wallace he stiffly stood, Till ten o the fyfteen Englishmen Before the door lay in their blude. 14 The other five to the greenwood ran, And he hangd these five upon a grain, And on the morn, wi his merry men a', He sat at dine in Lochmaben town.

An weel may ye saep, an me to see! If ye have ony tidins to tell, I pray you tell them unto me.’ 4 ‘I have no tidins for to tell, Nor ony uncos do I ken; But up into yon little alehouse An there sits fyfteen Englishmen. 5 ‘An ay they are speakin o Gude Wallace, An ay they are doomin him to hang:’ ‘O forbid!’ quo Gude Wallace, ‘He's owre truehearted a Scotsman. 6 ‘Had I but a penny in my pouch, As I have not a single bawbee, I would up into yon little alehouse, An ay thae southron blades to see.’ 7 She's put her hand into her pouch, An counted him out pennies three; ‘If ever I live to come back this way, Weel paid the money it shall be.’ 8 He's taen a staff into his hand, An leand himsel outowre a tree, An he's awa to yon little alehouse, An ay the southron louns to see. 9 When he gaed in to that little alehouse, He bad his bennison be there; The captain answered him [in] wrath, He answerd him with domineer. 10 ‘O whare was ye born, ye crooked auld carle? An how may this your dwellin be?’ ‘O I was born in fair Scotland, A crooked carle altho I be.’ 11 ‘O I would een gie twenty shillins To ony sic crooked carle as thee That wad find me out Gude Wallace; For ay that traitor I lang to see.’ 12 ‘Haud out your hand,’ quo Gude Wallace, ‘I doubt your money be not gude; If ye'll gie ither twenty shillins, It neer shall bide ye anither bode.’ 13 He's taen the captain outowre the jaws, Anither word spak he neer mair; An five he sticket whare they sat, The rest lay scramblin here an there. 14 ‘Get up, get up, gudewife,’ he says, ‘An get some meat ready for me, For I hae fasted this three lang days; A wat right hungry I may be.’ 15 The meat it wasna weel made ready, Nor as weel on the table set, Till there cam fyfteen Englishmen An lighted a' about the yett. 16 The gudewife ran but, the gudeman ran ben; It put them a' in sic a stoure That five he sticket whare they sat, An five lay sprawlin at the door. 17 An five are to the greenwood gane, An he's hangd them a' outowre a tree, An before the mornin twal o clock He dined wi his men at Loch Marie. Willie Wallace GUDE WALLACE—E Communicated to James Telfer by A. Fisher, as written down from the mouth of a serving-man, who had learned it in the neighborhood of Lochmaben. Mr Robert White's papers. 1 Willie Wallace the water lap, And lighted low down in a glen; There he came to a woman washing, And she had washers nine or ten. 2 ‘O weel may ye wash!’ said Willie Wallace, ‘O weel may ye wash!’ said fair Willie, ‘And gin ye have any tidings to tell, I pray ye tell them unto me.’ 3 ‘I have nae tidings for to tell, And as few will I let ye ken; But down into yon hosteler-ha Lies fifteen English gentlemen.’ 4 ‘O had I ae penny in my pocket, Or had I yet ane bare bawbee, I would go to yon hosteler-ha, All for these Englishmen to see. 5 ‘O wil ye len me ane pennie, Or will ye len me a bare bawbee, I would go to yon hosteler-ha, All for these Englishmen to see.’ 6 She's put her hand into her pocket, And she's gaen him out guineas three, And he's away to yon ostler-ha, All for these Englishmen to see. 7 Before he came to the hosteler-ha, He linkit his armour oer a tree; These Englishmen, being weel book-learned, They said to him, Great Dominie! 8 Where was ye born, ye crookit carle? Where was ye born, or in what countrie? ‘In merry Scotland I was born, A crookit carle altho I be.’ 9 ‘Here's fifteen shillings,’ one of them said, ‘Here's other fifteen I'll gie to thee, If you will tell me where the traitor Willie Wallace is, Or where away thou thinks he'll be.’ 10 ‘Pay down, pay down your money,’ he said, ‘Pay down, pay down richt speedilie, For if your answer be not good, You shall have the downfall of Robin Hood,’ [said he]. 11 He struck the captain on the jaw, He swore that he would chow nae mair cheese; He's killed all the rest with his good broadsword, And left them wallowing on their knees. 12 ‘Go cover the table,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘Go cover the table, get me some meat, For it is three days and rather mair Since I did either drink or eat.’ 13 They had not the table weel covered, Nor yet the candle weel gaen licht, Till fifteen other Englishmen They a' down at the door did light. 14 ‘Come out, come out, Willie Wallace,’ they said. ‘Come out, come out, and do not flee, For we have sworn by our good broadswords That this is the nicht that you sall dee.’ 15 He's killed five with his good broadsword, He's drowned other five in the raging sea, And he's taen other five to the merry greenwood, And hanged them oer the highest tree. Willie Wallace GUDE WALLACE—F Buchan's Gleanings, p. 114; from a gypsy tinker, p. 199. 1 Wallace in the high highlans, Neither meat nor drink got he; Said, Fa me life, or fa me death, Now to some town I maun be. 2 He's put on his short claiding, And on his short claiding put he; Says, Fa me life, or fa me death, Now to Perth-town I maun be. 3 He steped oer the river Tay, I wat he steped on dry land; He was aware of a well-fared maid, Was washing there her lilie hands. 4 ‘What news, what news, ye well-fared maid? What news hae ye this day to me?’ ‘No news, no news, ye gentle knight, No news hae I this day to thee, But fifteen lords in the hostage-house Waiting Wallace for to see.’ 5 ‘If I had but in my pocket The worth of one single pennie, I would go to the hostage-house, And there the gentlemen to see.’ 6 She put her hand in her pocket, And she has pulld out half-a-crown; Says, Take ye that, ye belted knight, 'Twill pay your way till ye come down. 7 As he went from the well-fared maid, A beggar bold I wat met he, Was coverd wi a clouted cloak, And in his hand a trusty tree. 8 ‘What news, what news, ye silly auld man? What news hae ye this day to gie?’ ‘No news, no news, ye belted knight, No news hae I this day to thee, But fifteen lords in the hostage-house Waiting Wallace for to see.’ 9 ‘Ye'll lend me your clouted cloak, That covers you frae head to shie, And I'll go to the hostage-house, Asking there for some supplie.’ 10 Now he's gone to the West-muir wood, And there he's pulld a trusty tree; And then he's on to the hostage gone, Asking there for charitie. 11 Down the stair the captain comes, Aye the poor man for to see: ‘If ye be a captain as good as ye look, Ye'll give a poor man some supplie; If ye be a captain as good as ye look, A guinea this day ye'll gie to me.’ 12 ‘Where were ye born, ye crooked carle? Where were ye born, in what countrie?’ ‘In fair Scotland I was born, Crooked carle that I be.’ 13 ‘I would give you fifty pounds, Of gold and white monie, I would give you fifty pounds, If the traitor Wallace ye'd let me see.’ 14 ‘Tell down your money,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘Tell down your money, if it be good; I'm sure I have it in my power, And never had a better bode. 15 ‘Tell down your money,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘And let me see if it be fine; I'm sure I have it in my power To bring the traitor Wallace in.’ 16 The money was told on the table, Silver bright of pounds fiftie; ‘Now here I stand,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘And what hae ye to say to me?’ 17 He slew the captain where he stood, The rest they did quack an roar; He slew the rest around the room, And askd if there were any more. 18 ‘Come, cover the table,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘Come, cover the table now, make haste; For it will soon be three lang days Sin I a bit o meat did taste.’ 19 The table was not well covered, Nor yet was he set down to dine, Till fifteen more of the English lords Surrounded the house where he was in. 20 The guidwife she ran but the floor, And aye the guidman he ran ben; From eight o clock till four at noon He has killd full thirty men. 21 He put the house in sick a swither That five o them he sticket dead, Five o them he drownd in the river, And five hung in the West-muir wood. 22 Now he is on to the North-Inch gone, Where the maid was washing tenderlie; ‘Now by my sooth,’ said Willie Wallace, ‘It's been a sair day's wark to me.’ 23 He's put his hand in his pocket, And he has pulld out twenty pounds; Says, Take ye that, ye weel-fared maid, For the gude luck of your half-crown.

Also Motherwell's MS., p. 487, communicated by Peter Buchan of Peterhead, “who had it from an old woman in that neighborhood.” 1 Woud ye hear of William Wallace, An sek him as he goes, Into the lan of Lanark, Amang his mortel faes? 2 There was fyften English sogers Unto his ladie cam, Said, Gie us William Wallace, That we may have him slain. 3 Woud ye gie William Wallace, That we may have him slain, And ye's be wedded to a lord, The best in Christendeem. 4 ‘This verra nicht at seven, Brave Wallace will come in, And he'll come to my chamber-door, Without or dread or din.’ 5 The fyften English sogers Around the house did wait, And four brave southron foragers Stood hie upon the gait. 6 That verra nicht at seven Brave Wallace he came in, And he came to his ladie's bouir, Withouten dread or din. 7 When she beheld him Wallace, She star'd him in the face; ‘Ohon, alas!’ said that ladie, ‘This is a woful case. 8 ‘For I this nicht have sold you, This nicht you must be taen, And I'm to be wedded to a lord, The best in Christendeem.’ 9 ‘Do you repent,’ said Wallace, ‘The ill you've dane to me?’ ‘Ay, that I do,’ said that ladie, ‘And will do till I die. 10 ‘Ay, that I do,’ said that ladie, ‘And will do ever still, And for the ill I've dane to you, Let me burn upon a hill.’ 11 ‘Now God forfend,’ says brave Wallace, ‘I shoud be so unkind; Whatever I am to Scotland's faes, I'm aye a woman's friend. 12 ‘Will ye gie me your gown, your gown, Your gown but and your kirtle, Your petticoat of bonny brown, And belt about my middle? 13 ‘I'll take a pitcher in ilka hand, And do me to the well; They'll think I'm one of your maidens, Or think it is yoursell.’ 14 She has gien him her gown, her gown, Her petticoat and kirtle, Her broadest belt, wi silver clasp, To bind about his middle. 15 He's taen a pitcher in ilka hand, And dane him to the well; They thought him one of her maidens, They kend it was nae hersell. 16 Said one of the southron foragers, See ye yon lusty dame? I woud nae gie muckle to thee, neebor, To bring her back agen. 17 Then all the southrous followd him, And sure they were but four; But he has drawn his trusty brand, And slew them pair by pair. 18 He threw the pitchers frae his hands, And to the hills fled he, Until he cam to a fair may, Was washin on yon lea. 19 ‘What news, what news, ye weel-far'd may? What news hae ye to gie?’ ‘Ill news, ill news,’ the fair may said, ‘Ill news I hae to thee. 20 ‘There is fyften English sogers Into that thatched inn, Seeking Sir William Wallace; I fear that he is slain.’ 21 ‘Have ye any money in your pocket? Pray lend it unto me, And when I come this way again, Repaid ye weel shall be.’ 22 She['s] put her hand in her pocket, And taen out shillings three; He turnd him right and round about, And thankd the weel-far'd may. 23 He had not gone a long rig length, A rig length and a span, Until he met a bold beggar, As sturdy as coud gang. 24 ‘What news, what news, ye bold beggar? What news hae ye to gie?’ ‘O heavy news,’ the beggar said, ‘I hae to tell to thee. 25 ‘There is fyften English sogers, I heard them in yon inn, Vowing to kill him Wallace; I fear the chief is slain.’ 26 ‘Will ye change apparell wi me, auld man? Change your apparell for mine? And when I come this way again, Ye'll be my ain poor man.’ 27 When he got on the beggar's coat, The pike-staff in his hand, He's dane him down to yon tavern, Where they were drinking wine. 28 ‘What news, what news, ye staff-beggar? What news hae ye to gie?’ ‘I hae nae news, I heard nae news, As few I'll hae frae thee.’ 29 ‘I think your coat is ragged, auld man; But woud you wages win, And tell where William Wallace is, We'll lay gold in your hand.’ 30 ‘Tell down, tell down your good red gold, Upon the table-head, And ye sall William Wallace see, Wi the down-come of Robin Hood.’ 31 They had nae tauld the money down, And laid it on his knee, When candles, lamps, and candlesticks, He on the floor gard flee. 32 And he has drawn his trusty brand, And slew them one by one, Then sat down at the table-head, And called for some wine. 33 The goodwife she ran but, ran but, The goodman he ran ben, The verra bairns about the fire Were a' like to gang brain. 34 ‘Now if there be a Scotsman here, He'll come and drink wi me; But if there be an English loun, It is his time to flee.’ 35 The goodman was an Englishman, And to the hills he ran; The goodwife was a Scots woman, And she came to his hand. Wallace and his Leman GUDE WALLACE—H Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 226. 1 Wallace wight, upon a night, Came riding oer the linn, And he is to his leman's bower, And tirld at the pin. 2 ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, lady?’ he said, ‘Ye'll rise, lat me come in.’ ‘O wha's this at my bower-door, That knocks, and knows my name?’ ‘My name is William Wallace; Ye may my errand ken.’ 3 ‘The truth to you I will rehearse, The secret I'll unfold; Into your enmies' hands this night I fairly hae you sold.’ 4 ‘If that be true ye tell to me, Do ye repent it sair?’ ‘O that I do,’ she said, ‘dear Wallace, And will do evermair! 5 ‘The English did surround my house, And forced me theretill; But for your sake, my dear Wallace, I coud burn on a hill.’ 6 Then he gae her a loving kiss, The tear droppd frae his ee; Says, Fare ye well for evermair, Your face nae mair I'll see. 7 She dressd him in her ain claithing, And frae her house he came; Which made the Englishmen admire, To see this stalwart dame. 8 He is to Saint Johnston gane, And there he playd him well; For there he saw a well-far'd may, Was washing at a well. 9 ‘What news, what news, ye well-far'd may? What news hae ye to me? What news, what news, ye well-far'd may, All from your north countrie?’ 10 ‘See ye not yon tavern-house, That stands on yonder plain? This very day have landet in it Full fifteen Englishmen; 11 ‘In search of Wallace, our dear champion, Ordaining that he shoud dee.’ ‘Then on my troth,’ said Wallace wight, ‘These Englishmen I'se see.’ GUDE WALLACE—I From C. K. Sharpe's “first collection,” p. 18. 1 ‘I wish I had a king,’ brave Wallace he said, ‘That every brave Scotsman might leave by his oun, For between me and my sovreign leige I think I see some ill [seed] sowen.’ 2 Brave Wallace out-oer yon river he lap, And he lighted low down on the plain, And he came to a gay lady, As she was at the well washing. 3 ‘Some tidings, some tidings,’ brave Wallace he said, ‘Some tidings ye most tell unto me; Now since we are met here togither on the plain, Some tidings ye most tell unto me.’ 4 ‘O go ye down to yon wee ale-house, And there is fifeteen Englishmen, And they are seeking for good Wallace, And him to take and him for to hang.’ 5 ‘I wish I had a penny in my pocket,’ he says, ‘Or although it were but a bare baubee, And I wad away to the wee ale-house, The fifeteen Englishmen to see.’ 6 She's put hir hand in hir left pocket, And fifeteen shillings to him she told down: ‘If ever I live to come back this way, The money's be well paid agein.’ 7 He louted twafauld oer a stick, And he louted threefauld oer a tree, And he'es gane awa to the wee ale-house, The fifeteen Englishmen to see. 8 When he came to the wee ale-house, He walked ben, says, Decencey be there! The Engilish proud captain he awnsered him, And he awnsered him with a graid domineer. 9 ‘Why, where wast thou born, thou old crooked carle? Where and of what country?’ ‘I am a true Scotsman bred and born, And an auld crooked carle, just sic as ye may see.’ 10 ‘I wad gee fifeteen shillings,’ the captain he said, ‘To an auld crooked carle, just sic a ane as thee, If ye wad tell me of Willie Wallace, For he's the man I wad fain see.’ 11 ‘O hold your hand,’ brave Wallace he said, ‘And let me see if yeer coin be good; If ye wad give fifeteen shillings more, Ye never bade a better boad.’ 12 He's tean the captain out-oer the chaft-blade, Till a bitt of meat he never did eat mair; He stickit a' the reste as the sat aroun the table, And he left them all a spraulling there. 13 ‘Get up, get up, goodwife,’ he says, ‘Get up and get me some denner in haste, For it is now three days and nights Since a bit of meat my mouth did taste.’ 14 The denner was not well made ready, Nor was it on the table sett, Till other fifeteen English men Were a' perading about the yett. 15 ‘Come out, come out now, Wallace,’ they crys, ‘For this is the place ye'es sure for [to] die;’ ‘I lippen not sae little to good,’ he says, ‘Although I be but ill-wordie.’ 16 The goodman ran butt, the goodwife ran ben, They put the house in such a fever! Five of them he sticket where they stood, And other five he smoddered in the gitter. 17 Five of them he folowd to the merry green-wood, And these five he hangt on a grain, And gin the morn at ten o'clock He was wi his mirry men at Lochmaben. 158 HUGH SPENCER'S FEATS IN FRANCE Hugh Spencer HUGH SPENCER'S FEATS IN FRANCE—A Percy MS., p. 281; Hales and Furnivall, II, 290. 1 The court is kept att leeue London, And euermore shall be itt; The King sent for a bold embassador, And Sir Hugh Spencer that he hight. 2 ‘Come hither, Spencer,’ saith our kinge, ‘And come thou hither vnto mee; I must make thee an embassadour Betweene the king of Ffrance and mee. 3 ‘Thou must comend me to the king of Ffrance, And tell him thus and now ffrom mee, I wold know whether there shold be peace in his land, Or open warr kept still must bee. 4 ‘Thou'st haue thy shipp at thy comande, Thou'st neither want for gold nor ffee; Thou'st haue a hundred armed men, All att thy bidding ffor to bee.’ 5 The wind itt serued, and they sayled, And towards Ffrance thus they be gone; The wind did bring them safe to shore, And safelye landed euerye one. 6 The Ffrenchmen lay on the castle-wall, The English souldiers to behold: ‘You are welcome, traitors, out of England; The heads of you are bought and sold.’ 7 With that spake proud Spencer: My leege, soe itt may not bee; I am sent an embassador Ffrom our English king to yee. 8 The king of England greetes you well, And hath sent this word by mee; He wold know whether there shold be peace in your land, Or open warres kept still must bee. 9 ‘Comend me to the English kinge, And tell this now ffrom mee; There shall neuer peace be kept in my land While open warres kept there may bee.’ 10 With that came downe the queene of Ffrance, And an angry woman then was shee; Saies, Itt had beene as ffitt now for a king To be in his chamber with his ladye, Then to be pleading with traitors out of England, Kneeling low vppon their knee. 11 But then bespake him proud Spencer, For noe man else durst speake but hee: You haue not wiped your mouth, madam, Since I heard you tell a lye. 12 ‘O hold thy tounge, Spencer!’ shee said, ‘I doe not come to plead with thee; Darest thou ryde a course of warr With a knight that I shall put to thee?’ 13 ‘But euer alacke!’ then Spencer sayd, ‘I thinke I haue deserued Gods cursse; Ffor I haue not any armour heere, Nor yett I haue noe iusting-horsse.’ 14 ‘Thy shankes,’ quoth shee, ‘beneath the knee Are verry small aboue the shinne Ffor to doe any such honourablle deeds As the Englishmen say thou has done. 15 ‘Thy shankes beene small aboue thy shoone, And soe the beene aboue thy knee; Thou art to slender euery way Any good iuster ffor to bee.’ 16 ‘But euer alacke,’ said Spencer then, ‘For one steed of the English countrye!’ With that bespake and one Ffrench knight, This day thou'st haue the choyce of three. 17 The first steed he ffeiched out, I-wis he was milke-white; The ffirst ffoot Spencer in stirropp sett, His backe did from his belly tyte. 18 The second steed that he ffeitcht out, I-wis that hee was verry browne; The second ffoot Spencer in stirropp settt, That horsse and man and all ffell downe. 19 The third steed that hee ffeitched out, I-wis that he was verry blacke; The third ffoote Spencer into the stirropp sett, He leaped on to the geldings backe. 20 ‘But euer alacke,’ said Spencer then, ‘For one good steed of the English countrye! Goe ffeitch me hither my old hacneye, That I brought with me hither beyond the sea.’ 21 But when his hackney there was brought, Spencer a merry man there was hee; Saies, With the grace of God and St George of England, The ffeild this day shall goe with mee. 22 ‘I haue not fforgotten,’ Spencer sayd, ‘Since there was ffeild foughten att Walsingam, When the horsse did heare the trumpetts sound, He did beare ore both horsse and man.’ 23 The day was sett, and togetther they mett, With great mirth and melodye, With minstrells playing, and trumpetts soundinge, With drumes striking loud and hye. 24 The ffirst race that Spencer run, I-wis hee run itt wonderous sore; He [hitt] the knight vpon his brest, But his speare itt burst, and wold touch noe more. 25 ‘But euer alacke,’ said Spencer then, ‘For one staffe of the English countrye! Without you'le bind me three together,’ Quoth hee, ‘they'le be to weake ffor mee.’ 26 With that bespake him the Ffrench knight, Sayes, Bind him together the whole thirtye, For I haue more strenght in my to hands Then is in all Spencers bodye. 27 ‘But proue att parting,’ Spencer sayes, ‘Ffrench knight, here I tell itt thee; For I will lay thee five to four The bigger man I proue to bee.’ 28 But the day was sett, and together they mett, With great mirth and melodye, With minstrells playing, and trumpetts soundinge, With drummes strikeing loud and hye. 29 The second race that Spencer run, I-wis hee ridd itt in much pride, And he hitt the knight vpon the brest, And draue him ore his horsse beside. 30 But he run thorrow the Ffrench campe; Such a race was neuer run beffore; He killed of King Charles his men Att hand of thirteen or fourteen score. 31 But he came backe againe to the K[ing], And kneeled him downe vpon his knee; Saies, A knight I haue slaine, and a steed I haue woone, The best that is in this countrye. 32 ‘But nay, by my faith,’ then said the King, ‘Spencer, soe itt shall not bee; I'le haue that traitors head of thine, To enter plea att my iollye.’ 33 But Spencer looket him once about, He had true bretheren left but four; He killed ther of the Kings gard About twelve or thirteen score. 34 ‘But hold thy hands,’ the King doth say, ‘Spencer, now I doe pray thee; And I will goe into litle England, Vnto that cruell kinge with thee.’ 35 ‘Nay, by my ffaith,’ Spencer sayd, ‘My leege, for soe itt shall not bee; For an you sett ffoot on English ground, You shall be hanged vpon a tree.’ 36 ‘Why then, comend [me] to that Englishe kinge, And tell him thus now ffrom mee, That there shall neuer be open warres kept in my land Whilest peace kept that there may bee.’ Hugh Spencer HUGH SPENCER'S FEATS IN FRANCE—B Percy Papers: communicated by the Duchess Dowager of Portland. 1 Our king lay at Westminster, as oft times he had done, And he sent for Hugh Spencer, to come to him anon. 2 Then in came Hugh Spencer, low kneeling on his knee: ‘What's the matter, my liege, you sent so speedily for me?’ 3 ‘Why you must go ambassadour to France now, to see Whether peace shall be taken, aye, or open wars must be.’ 4 ‘Who shall go with me?’ says Hugh Spencer, he: ‘That shall Hugh Willoughby and John of Atherly.’ ‘O then,’ says Hugh Spencer, ‘we'll be a merry company.’ 5 When they came before the French king, they kneeled low on the knee: ‘O rise up, and stand up, whose men soer you be.’ 6 The first that made answer was Hugh Spencer, he: ‘We are English ambassadours, come hither to see Whether peace shall be taken, aye, or open wars must be.’ 7 Then spoke the French king, and he spoke courteously: The last time peace was broken, it was neer along of me. 8 For you sunk my ships, slew my men, and thus did ye; And the last time peace was broken, it was neer along of me. 9 Then in came Queen Maude, and full as ill was she: ‘A chamber of presence is better for thee, Then amongst English shepherds, low bending on the knee.’ 10 The first that made answer was Hugh Spencer, he: ‘We are no English shepherds, Queen Maude, I tell thee, But we're knights, and knights fellows, the worst man in our company.’ 11 O then spoke Queen Maude, and full as ill was she: Thou shouldst be Hugh Spencer, thou talkst so boldly. 12 And if thou beest Hugh Spencer, as well thou seemst to be, I've oft heard of thy justling, and some of it would fain see. 13 I have a steed in my stable that thou canst not ride; I have a spear in my keeping that thou canst not guide; And I have a knight in my realm that thou darest not abide. 14 Then Spencer askd Willoughby and John of Atherly Whether he should take this justling in hand, aye, or let it be. 15 O then spoke Hugh Willoughby and John of Atherly: If you won't take it [in] hand, why turn it unto we. 16 ‘It shall neer be said in England,’ says Hugh Spencer, he, ‘That I refused a good justling and turned it to ye. 17 ‘Alas,’ says Hugh Spencer, ‘full sore may I moan, I have nought here but an ambler, my good steed's at home.’ 18 Then spoke a French knight, and he spoke courteously: I have thirty steeds in my stables, the best of them take to thee. 19 ‘Gramercy,’ says Spencer, ‘aye, and gramercy; If eer thou comest to England, well rewarded shalt thou be.’ 20 The first steed they brought him, he was a milk-white: ‘Take that away,’ says Spencer, ‘for I do not him like.’ 21 The next steed they brought him, he was a good dun: ‘Take that away,’ says Spencer, ‘for he's not for my turn.’ 22 The next steed they brought him, he was a dapple-grey: ‘Take that away,’ says Spencer, ‘for he is not used to the way.’ 23 The next steed they brought him, he was a coal-black; His eyes burnt in his head, as if fire were in flax; ‘Come saddle me that horse,’ says Spencer, ‘for I'll have none but that.’ 24 When that horse was saddled, and Spencer got on, With his spear at his foot, O he was portly man! 25 ‘Now I am on that steede-back that I could not ride, That spear in my keeping that I could not guide, Come shew me that French knight that I dare not abide.’ 26 ‘It is a sign by thy sharp shin, ay, and thy cropped knee, That you are no fit match to justle with me:’ ‘Why it makes no matter,’ says Spencer, ‘you hear no brags of me.’ 27 The first time they rode together, now Sir Hugh and he, He turnd him in his saddle like an apple on a tree. 28 The next time they rode together, now Sir Hugh and he, He lit upon his breast-plate, and he broke his spear in three. 29 ‘A spear now,’ says Spencer, ‘a spear now get me:’ ‘Thou shalt have one,’ says Willoughby, ‘if in France one there be.’ 30 ‘O tye two together, and the stronger they'l be, For the French is the better, and the better shall be:’ ‘Why it makes no matter,’ says Spencer, ‘you hear no brags of me.’ 31 The next time they rode together, now Sir Hugh and he, He threw him fifteen foot from his saddle, and he broke his back in three: ‘Now I have slain thy justler, Queen Maude, I tell thee.’ 32 O then spoke Queen Maude, and full as ill was she: If thou'st slain my justler, by the Kings laws thou'st dye. 33 ‘It shall neer be said in England,’ says Hugh Spencer, he; ‘It shall neer be said in England,’ says Hugh Willoughby; 34 ‘It shall neer be said in England,’ says John of Atherly, ‘That a queen of another nation eer had her will of we.’ 35 They laid their heads together, and their backs to the wall; There were four score of the Queen's guards, and they slew them all. 36 Then spoke the French king, and he spoke courteously: O hold thy hand, Spencer, I dearly pray thee. 37 Thou art sharp as thy spear, and as fierce as thy steed, And the stour of thy lilly-white hand makes my heart bleed. 38 Thou hadst twenty ships hither, thou'st have twenty away; Then hold thy hand, Spencer, I dearly thee pray. HUGH SPENCER'S FEATS IN FRANCE—C Dr Joseph Robertson's Journal of Excursions, No 4; taken down from a man in the parish of Leochel, Aberdeenshire, 13 February, 1829. 1 It fell about the Martinmas time The wind blew loud and cauld, And all the knichts of fair Scotland They drew them to sum hald. 2 Unless it was him young Sir Hugh, And he beet to sail the sea, Wi a letter between twa kings, to see an they wald lat down the wars, And live and lat them be. 3 On Friday shipped he, and lang Ere Wodensday at noon In fair France landed he, 4 He fell down before the King, On his bare knees: ‘Gude mak ye safe and soun;’ ‘Fat news o your contrie?’ he says. 5 ‘The news o our countrie,’ he says, ‘Is but news brought over the sea, To see an ye'll lat down the wars, And live and lat them be.’ 6 ‘Deed no,’ he says; ‘I'm but an auld man indeed, But I'll no lat down the wars, And live and lat them be.’ 7 It's out it spak the Queen hersel: I have a shepherd's sin Would fight an hour wi you; ‘And by my seeth,’ says young Sir Hugh, ‘That sight fain would I see.’ 8 The firsten steed that he drew out, He was the penny-gray; He wad hae ridden oer meel or mor A leve-lang summer's day. 9 O girths they brak, and great horse lap, But still sat he on he: ‘A girth, a girth,’ says young Sir Hugh, ‘A girth for charity!’ ‘O every girth that you shall have, Its gude lord shall hae three.’ 10 The nexten steed that he drew out, He was the penny-brown; He wad hae ridden oer meel or mor As ever the dew drap down. 11 O bridles brak, and great horse lap, But still sat he on he: ‘A bridle, a bridle,’ says young Sir Hugh, ‘A bridle for charitie!’ ‘O every bridle that you shall have, And its gude lord shall have three.’ 12 The nexten steed that he drew out He was the raven-black; His een was glancin in his head Like wild-fire in a slack; ‘Get here a boy,’ says young Sir Hugh, ‘Cast on the saddle on that.’ 13 O brands there brak, and great horse lap, But still sat he on he: ‘A brand, a brand,’ says young Sir Hugh, ‘A brand for charitie!’ ‘O every brand that you sall have, And its gude lord sall have three.’ 14 He gave him a dep unto the heart, And over the steed fell he: ‘I rather had gane you money,’ she says, ‘And free lands too, That ye had foughten an hour wi him, And than had latten him be.’ 15 ‘If ye hae ony mair shepherd's sins,’ he says, ‘Or cooks i your kitchie, Or ony mair dogs to fell, Ye'll bring them here to me; And gin they be a true-hearted Scotsman, They'll no be scorned by thee.’ 159 DURHAM FIELD Durham ffeilde Percy MS., p. 245; Hales and Furnivall, II, 190. 1 Lordinges, listen, and hold you still; Hearken to me a litle; I shall you tell of the fairest battell That euer in England beffell. 2 For as it befell in Edward the Thirds dayes, In England, where he ware the crowne, Then all the cheefe chiualry of England They busked and made them bowne. 3 They chosen all the best archers That in England might be found, And all was to fight with the king of Ffrance, Within a litle stounde. 4 And when our king was ouer the water, And on the salt sea gone, Then tydings into Scotland came That all England was gone. 5 Bowes and arrowes they were all forth, At home was not left a man But shepards and millers both, And preists with shauen crownes. 6 Then the king of Scotts in a study stood, As he was a man of great might; He sware he wold hold his parlament in leeue London, If he cold ryde there right. 7 Then bespake a squier, of Scottland borne, And sayd, My leege, apace, Before you come to leeue London, Full sore you'le rue that race. 8 Ther beene bold yeomen in merry England, Husbandmen stiffe and strong; Sharpe swords they done weare, Bearen bowes and arrowes longe. 9 The King was angrye at that word; A long sword out hee drew, And there befor his royall companye His owne squier hee slew. 10 Hard hansell had the Scottes that day, That wrought them woe enoughe, For then durst not a Scott speake a word Ffor hanging att a boughe. 11 ‘The Earle of Anguish, where art thou? In my coate-armor thou shalt bee, And thou shalt lead the forward Thorrow the English countrye. 12 ‘Take thee Yorke,’ then sayd the King, ‘In stead wheras it doth stand; I'le make thy eldest sonne after thee Heyre of all Northumberland. 13 ‘The Earle of Vaughan, where be yee? In my coate-armor thou shalt bee; The high Peak and Darbyshire I giue it thee to thy fee.’ 14 Then came in famous Douglas, Saies, What shall my meede bee? And I'le lead the vawward, lord, Thorow the English countrye. 15 ‘Take thee Worster,’ sayd the King, ‘Tuxburye, Killingworth, Burton vpon Trent; Doe thou not say another day But I haue giuen thee lands and rent. 16 ‘Sir Richard of Edenborrow, where are yee? A wise man in this warr! I'le giue thee Bristow and the shire The time that wee come there. 17 ‘My lord Nevill, where beene yee? You must in this warres bee; I'le giue thee Shrewsburye,’ saies the King, ‘And Couentrye faire and free. 18 ‘My lord of Hambleton, where art thou? Thou art of my kin full nye; I'le giue thee Lincolne and Lincolneshire, And that's enouge for thee.’ 19 By then came in William Douglas, As breeme as any bore; He kneeled him downe vpon his knees, In his hart he sighed sore. 20 Saies, I haue serued you, my louelye leege, This thirty winters and four, And in the Marches betweene England and Scottland I haue beene wounded and beaten sore. 21 For all the good service that I haue done, What shall my meed bee? And I will lead the vanward Thorrow the English countrye. 22 ‘Aske on, Douglas,’ said the king, ‘And granted it shall bee:’ ‘Why then, I aske litle London,’ saies William Douglas, ‘Gotten giff that it bee.’ 23 The King was wrath, and rose away, Saies, Nay, that cannot bee! For that I will keepe for my cheefe chamber, Gotten if it bee. 24 But take thee North Wales and Weschaster, The cuntrye all round about, And rewarded thou shalt bee, Of that take thou noe doubt. 25 Fiue score knights he made on a day, And dubbd them with his hands; Rewarded them right worthilye With the townes in merry England. 26 And when the fresh knights they were made, To battell the buske them bowne; Iames Douglas went before, And he thought to haue wonnen him shoone. 27 But the were mett in a morning of May With the comminaltye of litle England; But there scaped neuer a man away, Through the might of Christës hand. 28 But all onely Iames Douglas; In Durham in the ffeild An arrow stroke him in the thye; Fast flinge[s he] towards the King. 29 The King looked toward litle Durham, Saies, All things is not well! For Iames Dowglas beares an arrow in his thye, The head of it is of steele. 30 ‘How now Iames?’ then said the King, ‘How now, how may this bee? And where beene all thy merrymen That thou tooke hence with thee?’ 31 ‘But cease, my king,’ saies Iames Douglas, ‘Aliue is not left a man!’ ‘Now by my faith,’ saies the king of Scottes, ‘That gate was euill gone. 32 ‘But I'le reuenge thy quarrell well, And of that thou may be faine; For one Scott will beate fiue Englishmen, If the meeten them on the plaine.’ 33 ‘Now hold your tounge,’ saies Iames Douglas, ‘For in faith that is not soe; For one English man is worth fiue Scotts, When they meeten together thoe. 34 ‘For they are as egar men to fight As a faulcon vpon a pray; Alas! if euer the winne the vanward, There scapes noe man away.’ 35 ‘O peace thy talking,’ said the King, ‘They bee but English knaues, But shepards and millers both, And preists with their staues.’ 36 The King sent forth one of his heralds of armes To vew the Englishmen: ‘Be of good cheere,’ the herald said, ‘For against one wee bee ten.’ 37 ‘Who leades those ladds?’ said the king of Scottes, ‘Thou herald, tell thou mee:’ The herald said, The Bishopp of Durham Is captaine of that companye. 38 ‘For the Bishopp hath spred the King's banner, And to battell he buskes him bowne:’ ‘I sweare by St. Andrewes bones,’ saies the King, ‘I'le rapp that preist on the crowne.’ 39 The King looked towards litle Durham, And that hee well beheld, That the Earle Percy was well armed, With his battell-axe entred the feild. 40 The King looket againe towards litle Durham, Four ancyents there see hee; There were to standards, six in a valley, He cold not see them with his eye. 41 My Lord of Yorke was one of them, My Lord of Carlile was the other, And my Lord Ffluwilliams, The one came with the other. 42 The Bishopp of Durham commanded his men, And shortlye he them bade, That neuer a man shold goe to the feild to fight Till he had serued his God. 43 Fiue hundred preists said masse that day In Durham in the feild, And afterwards, as I hard say, They bare both speare and sheeld. 44 The Bishopp of Durham orders himselfe to fight, With his battell-axe in his hand; He said, This day now I will fight As long as I can stand! 45 ‘And soe will I,’ sayd my Lord of Carlile, ‘In this faire morning gay;’ ‘And soe will I,’ said my Lord Ffluwilliams, ‘For Mary, that myld may.’ 46 Our English archers bent their bowes Shortlye and anon; They shott ouer the Scottish oast And scantlye toucht a man. 47 ‘Hold downe your hands,’ sayd the Bishopp of Durham, ‘My archers good and true:’ The second shoote that the shott, Full sore the Scottes itt rue. 48 The Bishopp of Durham spoke on hye, That both partyes might heare: ‘Be of good cheere, my merrymen all, The Scotts flyen, and changen there cheere.’ 49 But as the saidden, soe the didden, They fell on heapës hye; Our Englishmen laid on with their bowes, As fast as they might dree. 50 The king of Scotts in a studye stood Amongst his companye; An arrow stoke him thorrow the nose, And thorrow his armorye. 51 The King went to a marsh-side And light beside his steede; He leaned him downe on his sword-hilts, To let his nose bleede. 52 There followed him a yeaman of merry England, His name was Iohn of Coplande: ‘Yeeld thee, traytor!’ saies Coplande then, ‘Thy liffe lyes in my hand.’ 53 ‘How shold I yeeld me,’ sayes the King, ‘And thou art noe gentleman?’ ‘Noe, by my troth,’ sayes Copland there, ‘I am but a poore yeaman. 54 ‘What art thou better then I, Sir King? Tell me if that thou can! What art thou better then I, Sir King, Now we be but man to man?’ 55 The King smote angerly at Copland then, Angerly in that stonde; And then Copland was a bold yeaman, And bore the King to the ground. 56 He sett the King upon a palfrey, Himselfe upon a steede; He tooke him by the bridle-rayne, Towards London he can him lead. 57 And when to London that he came, The King from Ffrance was new come home, And there unto the king of Scottes He sayd these words anon. 58 ‘How like you my shepards and my millers? My priests with shaven crownes?’ ‘By my fayth, they are the sorest fighting men That ever I mett on the ground. 59 ‘There was never a yeaman in merry England But he was worth a Scottish knight:’ ‘I, by my troth,’ said King Edward, and laughe, ‘For you fought all against the right.’ 60 But now the prince of merry England, Worthilye under his sheelde, Hath taken the king of Ffrance, At Poytiers in the ffeelde. 61 The prince did present his father with that food, The louely king off Ffrance, And fforward of his iourney he is gone: God send us all good chance! 62 ‘You are welcome, brother!’ sayd the king of Scotts, to the king of Ffrance, ‘For I am come hither to soone; Christ leeve that I had taken my way Unto the court of Roome!’ 63 ‘And soe wold I,’ said the king of Ffrance, ‘When I came over the streame, That I had taken my iourney Unto Ierusalem!’ 64 Thus ends the battell of ffaire Durham, In one morning of May, The battell of Cressey, and the battle of Potyers, All within one monthës day. 65 Then was welthe and welfare in mery England, Solaces, game, and glee, And every man loved other well, And the King loved good yeomanrye. 66 But God that made the grasse to growe, And leaves on greenwoode tree, Now save and keepe our noble king, And maintaine good yeomanry! 160 THE KNIGHT OF LIDDESDALE THE KNIGHT OF LIDDESDALE Hume of Godscroft, History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus, 1644, p. 77.

He lyghted dowyn vpon his foote, And schoote hys horsse clene awaye. 33 Euery man sawe that he dyd soo, That ryall was euer in rowght; Euery man schoote hys horsse hym froo, And lyght hym rowynde abowght. 34 Thus Syr Hary Perssye toke the fylde, For soth as I yow saye; Jhesu Cryste in hevyn on hyght Dyd helpe hym well that daye. 35 But nyne thowzand, ther was no moo, The cronykle wyll not layne; Forty thowsande of Skottes and fowre That day fowght them agayne. 36 But when the batell byganne to ioyne, In hast ther cam a knyght; The letters fayre furth hath he tayne, And thus he sayd full ryght: 37 ‘My lorde your father he gretes yow well, Wyth many a noble knyght; He desyres yow to byde That he may see thys fyght. 38 ‘The Baron of Grastoke ys com out of the west, Wyth hym a noble companye; All they loge at your fathers thys nyght, And the batell fayne wolde they see.’ 39 ‘For Jhesus love,’ sayd Syr Harye Perssy, ‘That dyed for yow and me, Wende to my lorde my father agayne, And saye thow sawe me not wyth yee. 40 ‘My trowth ys plyght to yonne Skottysh knyght, It nedes me not to layne, That I schulde byde hym vpon thys bent, And I haue hys trowth agayne. 41 ‘And if that I w[e]ynde of thys growende, For soth, onfowghten awaye, He wolde me call but a knowarde knyght In hys londe another daye. 42 ‘Yet had I lever to be rynde and rente, By Mary, that mykkel maye, Then ever my manhood schulde be reprovyd Wyth a Skotte another day. 43 ‘Wherfore schote, archars, for my sake, And let scharpe arowes flee; Mynstrells, playe vp for your waryson, And well quyt it schall bee. 44 ‘Euery man thynke on hys trewe-love, And marke hym to the Trenite; For to God I make myne avowe Thys day wyll I not flee.’ 45 The blodye harte in the Dowglas armes, Hys standerde stode on hye, That euery man myght full well knowe; By syde stode starrës thre. 46 The whyte lyon on the Ynglyssh perte, For soth as I yow sayne, The lucettes and the cressawntes both; The Skottes favght them agayne. 47 Vpon Sent Androwe lowde can they crye, And thrysse they schowte on hyght, And syne merked them one owr Ynglysshe men, As I haue tolde yow ryght. 48 Sent George the bryght, owr ladyes knyght, To name they were full fayne; Owr Ynglyssh men they cryde on hyght, And thrysse the schowtte agayne. 49 Wyth that scharpe arowes bygan to flee, I tell yow in sertayne; Men of armes byganne to joyne, Many a dowghty man was ther slayne. 50 The Perssy and the Dowglas mette, That ether of other was fayne; They swapped together whyll that the swette, Wyth swordes of fyne collayne: 51 Tyll the bloode from ther bassonnettes ranne, As the roke doth in the rayne; ‘Yelde the to me,’ sayd the Dowglas, ‘Or elles thow schalt be slayne. 52 ‘For I see by thy bryght bassonet, Thow arte sum man of myght; And so I do by thy burnysshed brande; Thow arte an yerle, or elles a knyght.’ 53 ‘By my good faythe,’ sayd the noble Perssye, ‘Now haste thow rede full ryght; Yet wyll I never yelde me to the, Whyll I may stonde and fyght.’ 54 They swapped together whyll that they swette, Wyth swordës scharpe and long; Ych on other so faste thee beette, Tyll ther helmes cam in peyses dowyn. 55 The Perssy was a man of strenghth, I tell yow in thys stounde; He smote the Dowglas at the swordës length That he felle to the growynde. 56 The sworde was scharpe, and sore can byte, I tell yow in sertayne; To the harte he cowde hym smyte, Thus was the Dowglas slayne. 57 The stonderdes stode styll on eke a syde, Wyth many a grevous grone; Ther the fowght the day, and all the nyght, And many a dowghty man was slayne. 58 Ther was no freke that ther wolde flye, But styffely in stowre can stond, Ychone hewyng on other whyll they myght drye, Wyth many a bayllefull bronde. 59 Ther was slayne vpon the Skottës syde, For soth and sertenly, Syr James a Dowglas ther was slayne, That day that he cowde dye. 60 The yerlle of Mentaye he was slayne, Grysely groned vpon the growynd; Syr Davy Skotte, Syr Water Stewarde, Syr Jhon of Agurstoune. 61 Syr Charllës Morrey in that place, That never a fote wold flee; Syr Hewe Maxwell, a lorde he was, Wyth the Dowglas dyd he dye. 62 Ther was slayne vpon the Skottës syde, For soth as I yow saye, Of fowre and forty thowsande Scottes Went but eyghtene awaye. 63 Ther was slayne vpon the Ynglysshe syde, For soth and sertenlye, A gentell knyght, Syr Jhon Fechewe, Yt was the more pety. 64 Syr James Hardbotell ther was slayne, For hym ther hartes were sore; The gentyll Lovell ther was slayne, That the Perssys standerd bore. 65 Ther was slayne vpon the Ynglyssh perte, For soth as I yow saye, Of nyne thowsand Ynglyssh men Fyve hondert cam awaye. 66 The other were slayne in the fylde; Cryste kepe ther sowlles from wo! Seyng ther was so fewe fryndes Agaynst so many a foo. 67 Then on the morne they mayde them beerys Of byrch and haysell graye; Many a wydowe, wyth wepyng teyres, Ther makes they fette awaye. 68 Thys fraye bygan at Otterborne, Bytwene the nyght and the day; Ther the Dowglas lost hys lyffe, And the Perssy was lede awaye. 69 Then was ther a Scottysh prisoner tayne, Syr Hewe Mongomery was hys name; For soth as I yow saye, He borowed the Perssy home agayne. 70 Now let vs all for the Perssy praye To Jhesu most of myght, To bryng hys sowlle to the blysse of heven, For he was a gentyll knyght.

Scott's Minstrelsy, I, 31, 1802, “corrected” from Herd, 1776, “by a MS. copy.” 1 It fell and about the Lammas time, When husbandmen do win their hay, Earl Douglass is to the English woods, And a' with him to fetch a prey. 2 He has chosen the Lindsays light, With them the gallant Gordons gay, And the Earl of Fyfe, withouten strife, And Sir Hugh Montgomery upon a grey. 3 They have taken Northumberland, And sae hae they the north shire, And the Otter Dale, they hae burnt it hale, And set it a' into fire. 4 Out then spake a bonny boy, That servd ane o Earl Douglass kin; Methinks I see an English host, A-coming branken us upon. 5 ‘If this be true, my little boy, And it be troth that thou tells me, The brawest bower in Otterburn This day shall be thy morning-fee. 6 ‘But if it be fase, my little boy, But and a lie that thou tells me, On the highest tree that's in Otterburn With my ain hands I'll hing thee high.’ 7 The boy's taen out his little penknife, That hanget low down by his gare, And he gaed Earl Douglass a deadly wound, Alack! a deep wound and a sare. 8 Earl Douglas said to Sir Hugh Montgomery, Take thou the vanguard o the three, And bury me at yon braken-bush, That stands upon yon lilly lee. 9 Then Percy and Montgomery met, And weel a wot they warna fain; They swaped swords, and they twa swat, And ay the blood ran down between. 10 ‘O yield thee, yield thee, Percy,’ he said, ‘Or else I vow I'll lay thee low;’ ‘Whom to shall I yield,’ said Earl Percy, ‘Now that I see it maun be so?’ 11 ‘O yield thee to yon braken-bush, That grows upon yon lilly lee; 12 ‘I winna yield to a braken-bush, Nor yet will I unto a brier; But I would yield to Earl Douglass, Or Sir Hugh Montgomery, if he was here.’ 13 As soon as he knew it was Montgomery, He stuck his sword's point in the ground, And Sir Hugh Montgomery was a courteous knight, And he quickly broght him by the hand. 14 This deed was done at Otterburn, About the breaking of the day; Earl Douglass was buried at the braken-bush, And Percy led captive away.

B completed by two copies “obtained from the recitation of old persons residing at the head of Ettrick Forest.” 1 It fell about the Lammas tide, When the muir-men win their hay, The doughty Douglas bound him to ride Into England, to drive a prey. 2 He chose the Gordons and the Grœmes, With them the Lindesays, light and gay; But the Jardines wald not with him ride, And they rue it to this day. 3 And he has burnd the dales of Tyne, And part of Bambrough shire, And three good towers on Reidswire fells, He left them all on fire. 4 And he marchd up to Newcastle, And rode it round about: ‘O wha's the lord of this castle? Or wha's the lady o't?’ 5 But up spake proud Lord Percy then, And O but he spake hie! I am the lord of this castle, My wife's the lady gay. 6 ‘If thou'rt the lord of this castle, Sae weel it pleases me, For, ere I cross the Border fells, The tane of us shall die.’ 7 He took a lang spear in his hand, Shod with the metal free, And for to meet the Douglas there He rode right furiouslie. 8 But O how pale his lady lookd, Frae aff the castle-wa, When down before the Scottish spear She saw proud Percy fa. 9 ‘Had we twa been upon the green, And never an eye to see, I wad hae had you, flesh and fell; But your sword sall gae wi me.’ 10 ‘But gae ye up to Otterbourne, And, wait there dayis three, And, if I come not ere three dayis end, A fause knight ca ye me.’ 11 ‘The Otterbourne's a bonnie burn; 'Tis pleasant there to be; But there is nought at Otterbourne To feed my men and me. 12 ‘The deer rins wild on hill and dale, The birds fly wild from tree to tree; But there is neither bread nor kale To fend my men and me. 13 ‘Yet I will stay at Otterbourne, Where you shall welcome be; And, if ye come not at three dayis end, A fause lord I'll ca thee.’ 14 ‘Thither will I come,’ proud Percy said, ‘By the might of Our Ladye;’ ‘There will I bide thee,’ said the Douglas, ‘My troth I plight to thee.’ 15 They lighted high on Otterbourne, Upon the bent sae brown; They lighted high on Otterbourne, And threw their pallions down. 16 And he that had a bonnie boy, Sent out his horse to grass; And he that had not a bonnie boy, His ain servant he was. 17 But up then spake a little page, Before the peep of dawn: ‘O waken ye, waken ye, my good lord, For Percy's hard at hand.’ 18 ‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye liar loud! Sae loud I hear ye lie: For Percy had not men yestreen To dight my men and me. 19 ‘But I have dreamd a dreary dream, Beyond the Isle of Sky; I saw a dead man win a fight, And I think that man was I.’ 20 He belted on his guid braid sword, And to the field he ran, But he forgot the helmet good, That should have kept his brain. 21 When Percy wi the Douglas met, I wat he was fu fain; They swakked their swords, till sair they swat, And the blood ran down like rain. 22 But Percy with his good broad sword, That could so sharply wound, Has wounded Douglas on the brow, Till he fell to the ground. 23 Then he calld on his little foot-page, And said, Run speedilie, And fetch my ain dear sister's son, Sir Hugh Montgomery. 24 ‘My nephew good,’ the Douglas said, ‘What recks the death of ane! Last night I dreamd a dreary dream, And I ken the day's thy ain. 25 ‘My wound is deep; I fain would sleep; Take thou the vanguard of the three, And hide me by the braken-bush, That grows on yonder lilye lee. 26 ‘O bury me by the braken-bush, Beneath the blooming brier; Let never living mortal ken That ere a kindly Scot lies here.’ 27 He lifted up that noble lord, Wi the saut tear in his ee; He hid him in the braken-bush, That his merrie men might not see. 28 The moon was clear, the day drew near, The spears in flinders flew, But mony a gallant Englishman Ere day the Scotsmen slew. 29 The Gordons good, in English blood They steepd their hose and shoon; The Lindsays flew like fire about, Till all the fray was done. 30 The Percy and Montgomery met, That either of other were fain; They swapped swords, and they twa swat, And aye the blood ran down between. 31 ‘Now yield thee, yield thee, Percy,’ he said, ‘Or else I vow I'll lay thee low!’ ‘To whom must I yield,’ quoth Earl Percy, ‘Now that I see it must be so?’ 32 ‘Thou shalt not yield to lord nor loun, Nor yet shalt thou yield to me; But yield thee to the braken-bush, That grows upon yon lilye lee.’ 33 ‘I will not yield to a braken-bush, Nor yet will I yield to a brier; But I would yield to Earl Douglas, Or Sir Hugh the Montgomery, if he were here.’ 34 As soon as he knew it was Montgomery, He struck his sword's point in the gronde; The Montgomery was a courteous knight, And quickly took him by the honde. 35 This deed was done at the Otterbourne, About the breaking of the day; Earl Douglas was buried at the braken-bush, And the Percy led captive away.

Be my troth, doughttë Doglas,’ he says, ‘thow shalt neuer se that day. 21 ‘Nethar in Ynglonde, Skottlonde, nar France, nor for no man of a woman born, But, and fortune be my chance, I dar met him, on man for on.’ 22 Then bespayke a squyar off Northombarlonde, Richard Wytharyngton was him nam; ‘It shall neuer be told in Sothe-Ynglonde,’ he says, ‘to Kyng Herry the Fourth for sham. 23 ‘I wat youe byn great lordës twaw, I am a poor squyar of lande; I wylle neuer se my captayne fyght on a fylde, and stande my selffe and loocke on, But whylle I may my weppone welde, I wylle not [fayle] both hart and hande.’ 24 That day, that day, that dredfull day! the first fit here I fynde; And youe wyll here any mor a the hountynge a the Chyviat, yet ys ther mor behynde. 25 The Yngglyshe men hade ther bowys yebent, ther hartes wer good yenoughe; The first off arros that the shote off, seven skore spear-men the sloughe. 26 Yet byddys the yerle Doglas vppon the bent, a captayne good yenoughe, And that was sene verament, for he wrought hom both woo and wouche. 27 The Dogglas partyd his ost in thre, lyk a cheffe cheften off pryde; With suar spears off myghttë tre, the cum in on euery syde; 28 Thrughe our Yngglyshe archery gave many a wounde fulle wyde; Many a doughetë the garde to dy, which ganyde them no pryde. 29 The Ynglyshe men let ther boÿs be, and pulde owt brandes that wer brighte; It was a hevy syght to se bryght swordes on basnites lyght. 30 Thorowe ryche male and myneyeple, many sterne the strocke done streght; Many a freyke that was fulle fre, ther vndar foot dyd lyght. 31 At last the Duglas and the Persë met, lyk to captayns of myght and of mayne; The swapte togethar tylle the both swat, with swordes that wear of fyn myllan. 32 Thes worthë freckys for to fyght, ther-to the wear fulle fayne, Tylle the bloode owte off thear basnetes sprente, as euer dyd heal or ra[y]n. 33 ‘Yelde the, Persë,’ sayde the Doglas, ‘and i feth I shalle the brynge Wher thowe shalte haue a yerls wagis of Jamy our Skottish kynge. 34 ‘Thoue shalte haue thy ransom fre, I hight the hear this thinge; For the manfullyste man yet art thowe that euer I conqueryd in filde fighttynge.’ 35 ‘Nay,’ sayd the lord Persë, ‘I tolde it the beforne, That I wolde neuer yeldyde be to no man of a woman born.’ 36 With that ther cam an arrowe hastely, forthe off a myghttë wane; Hit hathe strekene the yerle Duglas in at the brest-bane. 37 Thorowe lyvar and longës bathe the sharpe arrowe ys gane, That neuer after in all his lyffe-days he spayke mo wordës but ane: That was, Fyghte ye, my myrry men, whyllys ye may, for my lyff-days ben gan. 38 The Persë leanyde on his brande, and sawe the Duglas de; He tooke the dede mane by the hande, and sayd, Wo ys me for the! 39 ‘To haue savyde thy lyffe, I wolde haue partyde with my landes for years thre, For a better man, of hart nare of hande, was nat in all the north contrë.’ 40 Off all that se a Skottishe knyght, was callyd Ser Hewe the Monggombyrry; He sawe the Duglas to the deth was dyght, he spendyd a spear, a trusti tre. 41 He rod vppone a corsiare throughe a hondrith archery: He neuer stynttyde, nar neuer blane, tylle he cam to the good lord Persë. 42 He set vppone the lorde Persë a dynte that was full soare; With a suar spear of a myghttë tre clean thorow the body he the Persë ber, 43 A the tothar syde that a man myght se a large cloth-yard and mare: Towe bettar captayns wear nat in Cristiantë then that day slan wear ther. 44 An archar off Northomberlonde say slean was the lord Persë; He bar a bende bowe in his hand, was made off trusti tre. 45 An arow that a cloth-yarde was lang to the harde stele halyde he; A dynt that was both sad and soar he sat on Ser Hewe the Monggombyrry. 46 The dynt yt was both sad and sar that he of Monggomberry sete; The swane-fethars that his arrowe bar with his hart-blood the wear wete. 47 Ther was neuer a freake wone foot wolde fle, but still in stour dyd stand, Heawyng on yche othar, whylle the myghte dre, with many a balfull brande. 48 This battell begane in Chyviat an owar befor the none, And when even-songe bell was rang, the battell was nat half done. 49 The tocke on ethar hande be the lyght off the mone; Many hade no strenght for to stande, in Chyviat the hillys abon. 50 Of fifteen hondrith archars of Ynglonde went away but seuenti and thre; Of twenti hondrith spear-men of Skotlonde, but even five and fifti. 51 But all wear slayne Cheviat within; the hade no streng[th]e to stand on hy; The chylde may rue that ys unborne, it was the mor pittë. 52 Thear was slayne, withe the lord Persë, Ser Johan of Agerstone, Ser Rogar, the hinde Hartly, Ser Wyllyam, the bolde Hearone. 53 Ser Jorg, the worthë Loumle, a knyghte of great renowen, Ser Raff, the ryche Rugbe, with dyntes wear beaten dowene. 54 For Wetharryngton my harte was wo, that euer he slayne shulde be; For when both his leggis wear hewyne in to, yet he knyled and fought on hys kny. 55 Ther was slayne, with the dougheti Duglas, Ser Hewe the Monggombyrry, Ser Dauy Lwdale, that worthë was, his sistars son was he. 56 Ser Charls a Murrë in that place, that neuer a foot wolde fle; Ser Hewe Maxwelle, a lorde he was, with the Doglas dyd he dey. 57 So on the morrowe the mayde them byears off birch and hasell so g[r]ay; Many wedous, with wepyng tears, cam to fache ther makys away. 58 Tivydale may carpe off care, Northombarlond may mayk great mon, For towe such captayns as slayne wear thear on the March-parti shall neuer be non. 59 Word ys commen to Eddenburrowe, to Jamy the Skottishe kynge, That dougheti Duglas, lyff-tenant of the Marches, he lay slean Chyviot within. 60 His handdës dyd he weal and wryng, he sayd, Alas, and woe ys me! Such an othar captayn Skotland within, he sayd, ye-feth shuld neuer be. 61 Worde ys commyn to lovly Londone, till the fourth Harry our kynge, That lord Persë, leyff-tenante of the Marchis, he lay slayne Chyviat within. 62 ‘God haue merci on his solle,’ sayde Kyng Harry, ‘good lord, yf thy will it be! I haue a hondrith captayns in Ynglonde,’ he sayd, ‘as good as euer was he: But, Persë, and I brook my lyffe, thy deth well quyte shall be.’ 63 As our noble kynge mayd his avowe, lyke a noble prince of renowen, For the deth of the lord Persë he dyde the battell of Hombyll-down; 64 Wher syx and thrittë Skottishe knyghtes on a day wear beaten down; Glendale glytteryde on ther armor bryght, over castille, towar, and town. 65 This was the hontynge off the Cheviat, that tear begane this spurn; Old men that knowen the grownde well yenoughe call it the battell of Otterburn. 66 At Otterburn begane this spurne, vppone a Monnynday; Ther was the doughtë Doglas slean, the Persë neuer went away. 67 Ther was neuer a tym on the Marche-partës sen the Doglas and the Persë met, But yt ys mervele and the rede blude ronne not, as the reane doys in the stret. 68 Ihesue Crist our balys bete, and to the blys vs brynge!

A woefull hunting once there did in Cheuy Chase befall. 2 To driue the deere with hound and horne Erle Pearcy took the way: The child may rue that is vnborne the hunting of that day! 3 The stout Erle of Northumberland a vow to God did make His pleasure in the Scottish woods three sommers days to take, 4 The cheefest harts in Cheuy C[h]ase to kill and beare away: These tydings to Erle Douglas came in Scottland, where he lay. 5 Who sent Erle Pearcy present word he wold prevent his sport; The English erle, not fearing that, did to the woods resort, 6 With fifteen hundred bowmen bold, all chosen men of might, Who knew ffull well in time of neede to ayme their shafts arright. 7 The gallant greyhound[s] swiftly ran to chase the fallow deere; On Munday they began to hunt, ere daylight did appeare. 8 And long before high noone the had a hundred fat buckes slaine; Then hauing dined, the drouyers went to rouze the deare againe. 9 The bowmen mustered on the hills, well able to endure; Theire backsids all with speciall care that day were guarded sure. 10 The hounds ran swiftly through the woods the nimble deere to take, That with their cryes the hills and dales an eccho shrill did make. 11 Lord Pearcy to the querry went to veiw the tender deere; Quoth he, Erle Douglas promised once this day to meete me heere; 12 But if I thought he wold not come, noe longer wold I stay. With that a braue younge gentlman thus to the erle did say: 13 ‘Loe, yonder doth Erle Douglas come, hys men in armour bright; Full twenty hundred Scottish speres all marching in our sight. 14 ‘All men of pleasant Tiuydale, fast by the riuer Tweede:’ ‘O ceaze your sportts!’ Erle Pearcy said, ‘and take your bowes with speede. 15 ‘And now with me, my countrymen, your courage forth advance! For there was neuer champion yett, in Scottland nor in Ffrance, 16 ‘That euer did on horsbacke come, [but], and if my hap it were, I durst encounter man for man, with him to breake a spere.’ 17 Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede, most like a baron bold, Rode formost of his company, whose armor shone like gold. 18 ‘Shew me,’ sayd hee, ‘whose men you bee that hunt soe boldly heere, That without my consent doe chase and kill my fallow deere.’ 19 The first man that did answer make was noble Pearcy hee, Who sayd, Wee list not to declare nor shew whose men wee bee; 20 ‘Yett wee will spend our deerest blood thy cheefest harts to slay.’ Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe, and thus in rage did say: 21 ‘Ere thus I will outbraued bee, one of vs tow shall dye; I know thee well, an erle thou art; Lord Pearcy, soe am I. 22 ‘But trust me, Pearcye, pittye it were, and great offence, to kill Then any of these our guiltlesse men, for they haue done none ill. 23 ‘Let thou and I the battell trye, and set our men aside:’ ‘Accurst bee [he!]’ Erle Pearcye sayd, ‘by whome it is denyed.’ 24 Then stept a gallant squire forth— Witherington was his name— Who said, ‘I wold not haue it told to Henery our king, for shame, 25 ‘That ere my captaine fought on foote, and I stand looking on. You bee two Erles,’ quoth Witheringhton, and I a squier alone; 26 ‘I'le doe the best that doe I may, while I haue power to stand; While I haue power to weeld my sword, I'le fight with hart and hand.’ 27 Our English archers bent their bowes; their harts were good and trew; Att the first flight of arrowes sent, full foure score Scotts the slew. 28 To driue the deere with hound and horne, Dauglas bade on the bent; Two captaines moued with mickle might, their speres to shiuers went. 29 They closed full fast on euerye side, noe slacknes there was found, But many a gallant gentleman lay gasping on the ground. 30 O Christ! it was great greeue to see how eche man chose his spere, And how the blood out of their brests did gush like water cleare. 31 At last these two stout erles did meet, like captaines of great might; Like lyons woode they layd on lode; the made a cruell fight. 32 The fought vntill they both did sweat, with swords of tempered steele, Till blood downe their cheekes like raine the trickling downe did feele. 33 ‘O yeeld thee, Pearcye!’ Douglas sayd, ‘and in faith I will thee bringe Where thou shall high advanced bee by Iames our Scottish king. 34 ‘Thy ransome I will freely giue, and this report of thee, Thou art the most couragious knight [that ever I did see.]’ 35 ‘Noe, Douglas!’ quoth Erle Percy then, ‘thy profer I doe scorne; I will not yeelde to any Scott that euer yett was borne!’ 36 With that there came an arrow keene, out of an English bow, Which stoke Erle Douglas on the brest a deepe and deadlye blow. 37 Who neuer sayd more words then these: Fight on, my merry men all! For why, my life is att [an] end, lord Pearcy sees my fall. 38 Then leauing liffe, Erle Pearcy tooke the dead man by the hand; Who said, ‘Erle Dowglas, for thy life, wold I had lost my land! 39 ‘O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed for sorrow for thy sake, For sure, a more redoubted knight mischance cold neuer take.’ 40 A knight amongst the Scotts there was which saw Erle Douglas dye, Who streight in hart did vow revenge vpon the Lord Pearcye. 41 Sir Hugh Mountgomerye was he called, who, with a spere full bright, Well mounted on a gallant steed, ran feircly through the fight, 42 And past the English archers all, without all dread or feare, And through Erle Percyes body then he thrust his hatfull spere. 43 With such a vehement force and might his body he did gore, The staff ran through the other side a large cloth-yard and more. 44 Thus did both those nobles dye, whose courage none cold staine; An English archer then perceiued the noble erle was slaine. 45 He had [a] good bow in his hand, made of a trusty tree; An arrow of a cloth-yard long to the hard head haled hee. 46 Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye his shaft full right he sett; The grey-goose-winge that was there-on in his harts bloode was wett. 47 This fight from breake of day did last till setting of the sun, For when the rung the euening-bell the battele scarse was done. 48 With stout Erle Percy there was slaine Sir Iohn of Egerton, Sir Robert Harcliffe and Sir William, Sir Iames, that bold barron. 49 And with Sir George and Sir Iames, both knights of good account, Good Sir Raphe Rebbye there was slaine, whose prowesse did surmount. 50 For Witherington needs must I wayle as one in dolefull dumpes, For when his leggs were smitten of, he fought vpon his stumpes. 51 And with Erle Dowglas there was slaine Sir Hugh Mountgomerye, And Sir Charles Morrell, that from feelde one foote wold neuer flee; 52 Sir Roger Heuer of Harcliffe tow, his sisters sonne was hee; Sir David Lambwell, well esteemed, but saved he cold not bee. 53 And the Lord Maxwell, in like case, with Douglas he did dye; Of twenty hundred Scottish speeres, scarce fifty-fiue did flye. 54 Of fifteen hundred Englishmen went home but fifty-three; The rest in Cheuy Chase were slaine, vnder the greenwoode tree. 55 Next day did many widdowes come their husbands to bewayle; They washt their wounds in brinish teares, but all wold not prevayle. 56 Theyr bodyes, bathed in purple blood, the bore with them away; They kist them dead a thousand times ere the were cladd in clay. 57 The newes was brought to Eddenborrow, where Scottlands king did rayne, That braue Erle Douglas soddainlye was with an arrow slaine. 58 ‘O heauy newes!’ King Iames can say; ‘Scottland may wittenesse bee I haue not any captaine more of such account as hee.’ 59 Like tydings to King Henery came, within as short a space, That Pearcy of Northumberland was slaine in Cheuy Chase. 60 ‘Now God be with him!’ said our king, ‘sith it will noe better bee; I trust I haue within my realme fiue hundred as good as hee. 61 ‘Yett shall not Scotts nor Scottland say but I will vengeance take, And be revenged on them all for braue Erle Percyes sake.’ 62 This vow the king did well performe after on Humble-downe; In one day fifty knights were slayne, with lords of great renowne. 63 And of the rest, of small account, did many hundreds dye: Thus endeth the hunting in Cheuy Chase, made by the Erle Pearcye. 64 God saue our king, and blesse this land with plentye, ioy, and peace, And grant hencforth that foule debate twixt noble men may ceaze! 163 THE BATTLE OF HARLAW THE BATTLE OF HARLAW—A a.

Did ye their numbers see? Come, tell to me, John Hielanman, What micht their numbers be?’ 6 ‘Yes, me was near, an near eneuch, An me their numbers saw; There was fifty thousan Hielanmen A-marchin to Harlaw.’ 7 ‘Gin that be true,’ says James the Rose, ‘We'll no come meikle speed; We'll cry upo our merry men, And lichtly mount our steed.’ 8 ‘Oh no, oh no,’ says John the Gryme, ‘That thing maun never be; The gallant Grymes were never bate, We'll try phat we can dee.’ 9 As I cam on, an farther on, An doun an by Harlaw, They fell fu close on ilka side; Sic fun ye never saw. 10 They fell fu close on ilka side, Sic fun ye never saw; For Hielan swords gied clash for clash, At the battle o Harlaw. 11 The Hielanmen, wi their lang swords, They laid on us fu sair, An they drave back our merry men Three acres breadth an mair. 12 Brave Forbës to his brither did say, Noo brither, dinna ye see? They beat us back on ilka side, An we'se be forced to flee. 13 ‘Oh no, oh no, my brither dear, That thing maun never be; Tak ye your good sword in your hand, An come your wa's wi me.’ 14 ‘Oh no, oh no, my brither dear, The clans they are ower strang, An they drive back our merry men, Wi swords baith sharp an lang.’ 15 Brave Forbës drew his men aside, Said, Tak your rest a while, Until I to Drumminnor send, To fess my coat o mail. 16 The servan he did ride, An his horse it did na fail, For in twa hours an a quarter He brocht the coat o mail. 17 Then back to back the brithers twa Gaed in amo the thrang, An they hewed doun the Hielanmen, Wi swords baith sharp an lang. 18 Macdonell, he was young an stout, Had on his coat o mail, An he has gane oot throw them a', To try his han himsell. 19 The first ae straik that Forbës strack, He garrt Macdonell reel, An the neist ae straik that Forbës strack, The great Macdonell fell. 20 An siccan a lierachie I'm sure ye never saw As wis amo the Hielanmen, When they saw Macdonell fa. 21 An whan they saw that he was deid, They turnd an ran awa, An they buried him in Leggett's Den, A large mile frae Harlaw. 22 They rade, they ran, an some did gang, They were o sma record; But Forbës an his merry men, They slew them a' the road. 23 On Monanday, at mornin, The battle it began, On Saturday, at gloamin, Ye'd scarce kent wha had wan. 24 An sic a weary buryin I'm sure ye never saw As wis the Sunday after that, On the muirs aneath Harlaw. 25 Gin ony body speer at you For them ye took awa, Ye may tell their wives and bairnies They're sleepin at Harlaw.

Fal, lal, etc. 2 He called for his lovely page, His lovely page then called he, Saying, You must go to the king of France, To the king of France, sir, ride speedily. 3 O then went away this lovely page, This lovely page then away went he; And when he came to the king of France, Low he fell down on his bended knee. 4 ‘My master greets you, worthy sir; Ten ton of gold that is due to he, That you will send him his tribute home, Or in French land you soon will him see.’ 5 ‘Your master's young and of tender years, Not fit to come into my degree, And I will send him three tennis-balls, That with them he may learn to play.’ 6 O then returned this lovely page, This lovely page then returned he, And when he came to our gracious king, Low he fell down on his bended knee. 7 ‘What news, what news, my trusty page? What is the news you have trought to me?’ ‘I have brought such news from the king of France That you and he will never agree. 8 ‘He says you're young and of tender years, Not fit to come into his degree, And he will send you three tennis-balls, That with them you may learn to play.’ 9 ‘Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire, And Derby Hills that are so free; No marryd man nor no widow's son; For no widow's curse shall go with me.’ 10 They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire, And Derby Hills that are so free; No marryd man, nor no widow's son; Yet there was a jovial bold company. 11 O then we marchd into the French land, With drums and trumpets so merrily; And then bespoke the king of France, ‘Lo, yonder comes proud King Henry.’ 12 The first shot that the Frenchmen gave, They killd our Englishmen so free; We killd ten thousand of the French, And the rest of them they ran away. 13 And then we marched to Paris gates, With drums and trumpets so merrily: O then bespoke the king of France, ‘The Lord have mercy on my men and me! 14 ‘O I will send him his tribute home, Ten ton of gold that is due to he, And the finest flower that is in all France To the Rose of England I will give free.’ 165 SIR JOHN BUTLER Sir Iohn Butler Percy MS., p. 427; Hales and Furnivall, III, 205. 1 But word is come to Warrington, And Busye Hall is laid about; Sir Iohn Butler and his merry men Stand in ffull great doubt. 2 When they came to Busye Hall Itt was the merke midnight, And all the bridges were vp drawen, And neuer a candle-light. 3 There they made them one good boate, All of one good bull skinn; William Sauage was one of the ffirst That euer came itt within. 4 Hee sayled ore his merrymen, By two and two together, And said itt was as good a bote As ere was made of lether. 5 ‘Waken you, waken you, deare ffather! God waken you within! For heere is your vnckle Standlye Come your hall within.’ 6 ‘If that be true, Ellen Butler, These tydings you tell mee, A hundred pound in good redd gold This night will not borrow mee.’ 7 Then came downe Ellen Butler And into her ffathers hall, And then came downe Ellen Butler, And shee was laced in pall. 8 ‘Where is thy ffather, Ellen Butler? Haue done, and tell itt mee:’ ‘My ffather is now to London ridden, As Christ shall haue part of mee.’ 9 ‘Now nay, now nay, Ellen Butler, Ffor soe itt must not bee; Ffor ere I goe fforth of this hall, Your ffather I must see.’ 10 The sought that hall then vp and downe Theras Iohn Butler lay; The sought that hall then vp and downe Theras Iohn Butler lay. 11 Ffaire him ffall, litle Holcrofft! Soe merrilye he kept the dore, Till that his head ffrom his shoulders Came tumbling downe the ffloore. 12 ‘Yeeld thee, yeelde thee, Iohn Butler! Yeelde thee now to mee!’ ‘I will yeelde me to my vnckle Stanlye, And neere to ffalse Peeter Lee.’ 13 ‘A preist, a preist,’ saies Ellen Butler, ‘To housle and to shriue! A preist, a preist,’ sais Ellen Butler, ‘While that my father is a man aliue!’ 14 Then bespake him William Sauage, A shames death may hee dye! Sayes, He shall haue no other preist But my bright sword and mee. 15 The Ladye Butler is to London rydden, Shee had better haue beene att home; Shee might haue beggd her owne marryed lord Att her good brother Iohn. 16 And as shee lay in leeue London, And as shee lay in her bedd, Shee dreamed her owne marryed lord Was swiminnge in blood soe red. 17 Shee called vp her merry men all, Long ere itt was day; Saies, Wee must ryde to Busye Hall, With all speed that wee may. 18 Shee mett with three Kendall men, Were ryding by the way: ‘Tydings, tydings, Kendall men, I pray you tell itt mee!’ 19 ‘Heauy tydings, deare madam; Ffrom you wee will not leane; The worthyest knight in merry England, Iohn Butler, Lord! hee is slaine!’ 20 ‘Ffarewell, ffarwell, Iohn Butler! Ffor thee I must neuer see: Ffarewell, ffarwell, Busiye Hall! For thee I will neuer come nye.’ 21 Now Ladye Butler is to London againe, In all the speed might bee, And when shee came before her prince, Shee kneeled low downe on her knee. 22 ‘A boone, a boone, my leege!’ shee sayes, ‘Ffor Gods loue grant itt mee!’ ‘What is thy boone, Lady Butler? Or what wold thou haue of mee? 23 ‘What is thy boone, Lady Butler? Or what wold thou haue of mee?’ ‘That ffalse Peeres of Lee, and my brother Stanley, And William Sauage, and all, may dye.’ 24 ‘Come you hither, Lady Butler, Come you ower this stone; Wold you haue three men ffor to dye, All ffor the losse off one? 25 ‘Come you hither, Lady Butler, With all the speed you may; If thou wilt come to London, Lady Butler, Thou shalt goe home Lady Gray.’ 166 THE ROSE OF ENGLAND The Rose of Englande Percy MS., p. 423; Hales and Furnivall, III, 187. 1 Throughout a garden greene and gay, A seemlye sight itt was to see How fflowers did flourish fresh and gay, And birds doe sing melodiouslye. 2 In the midst of a garden there sprange a tree, Which tree was of a mickle price, And there vppon sprang the rose soe redd, The goodlyest that euer sprange on rise. 3 This rose was ffaire, ffresh to behold, Springing with many a royall lance; A crowned king, with a crowne of gold, Ouer England, Ireland, and of Ffrance. 4 Then came in a beast men call a bore, And he rooted this garden vpp and downe; By the seede of the rose he sett noe store, But afterwards itt wore the crowne. 5 Hee tooke the branches of this rose away, And all in sunder did them teare, And he buryed them vnder a clodd of clay, Swore they shold neuer bloome nor beare. 6 Then came in an egle gleaming gay, Of all ffaire birds well worth the best; He took the branche of the rose away, And bore itt to Latham to his nest. 7 But now is this rose out of England exiled, This certaine truth I will not laine; But if itt please you to sitt a while, I'le tell you how the rose came in againe. 8 Att Milford Hauen he entered in; To claime his right, was his delight; He brought the blew bore in with him, To encounter with the bore soe white. 9 The[n] a messenger the rose did send To the egles nest, and bidd him hye: ‘To my ffather, the old egle, I doe [me] comend, His aide and helpe I craue speedylye.’ 10 Saies, I desire my father att my cominge Of men and mony att my need, And alsoe my mother of her deer blessing; The better then I hope to speede. 11 And when the messenger came before thold egle, He kneeled him downe vpon his knee; Saith, Well greeteth you my lord the rose, He hath sent you greetings here by me. 12 Safe ffrom the seas Christ hath him sent, Now he is entered England within: ‘Let vs thanke God,’ the old egle did say, ‘He shall be the fflower of all his kine. 13 ‘Wend away, messenger, with might and maine; Itt's hard to know who a man may trust; I hope the rose shall fflourish againe, And haue all things att his owne lust.’ 14 Then Sir Rice ap Thomas drawes Wales with him; A worthy sight itt was to see, How the Welchmen rose wholy with him, And shogged them to Shrewsburye. 15 Att that time was baylye in Shrewsburye One Master Mitton, in the towne; The gates were strong, and he mad them ffast, And the portcullis he lett downe. 16 And throug a garrett of the walls, Ouer Severne these words said hee; ‘Att these gates no man enter shall;’ But he kept him out a night and a day. 17 These words Mitton did Erle Richmond tell (I am sure the chronicles of this will not lye); But when lettres came from Sir William Stanley of the Holt castle, Then the gates were opened presentlye. 18 Then entred this towne the noble lord, The Erle Richmond, the rose soe redd; The Erle of Oxford, with a sword, Wold haue smitt of the bailiffes head. 19 ‘But hold your hand,’ saies Erle Richmond, ‘Ffor his loue that dyed vpon a tree! Ffor if wee begin to head so soone, In England wee shall beare no degree.’ 20 ‘What offence haue I made thee,’ sayd Erle Richmonde, ‘That thou kept me out of my towne?’ ‘I know no king,’ sayd Mitton then, ‘But Richard now, that weares the crowne.’ 21 ‘Why, what wilt thou say,’ said Erle Richmonde, ‘When I haue put King Richard downe?’ ‘Why, then Ile be as true to you, my lord, After the time that I am sworne.’ 22 ‘Were itt not great pitty,’ sayd Erle Richmond, ‘That such a man as this shold dye, Such loyall service by him done? (The cronickles of this will not lye.) 23 ‘Thou shalt not be harmed in any case;’ He pardone[d] him presentlye; They stayd not past a night and a day, But towards Newport did they hye. 24 But [at] Attherston these lords did meete; A worthy sight itt was to see, How Erle Richmond tooke his hatt in his hand, And said, Cheshire and Lancashire, welcome to me! 25 But now is a bird of the egle taken; Ffrom the white bore he cannot fflee; Therfore the old egle makes great moane, And prayes to God most certainly. 26 ‘O stedfast God, verament,’ he did say, ‘Thre persons in one god in Trinytye, Saue my sonne, the young egle, this day Ffrom all ffalse craft and trecherye!’ 27 Then the blew bore the vanward had; He was both warry and wise of witt; The right hand of them he tooke, The sunn and wind of them to gett. 28 Then the egle ffollowed fast vpon his pray, With sore dints he did them smyte; The talbott he bitt wonderous sore, Soe well the vnicorne did him quite. 29 And then came in the harts head; A worthy sight itt was to see, The iacketts that were of white and redd, How they laid about them lustilye. 30 But now is the ffeirce ffeeld foughten and ended, And the white bore there lyeth slaine, And the young egle is preserued, And come to his nest againe. 31 But now this garden fflourishes ffreshly and gay, With ffragrant fflowers comely of hew, And gardners itt doth maintaine; I hope they will proue iust and true. 32 Our king, he is the rose soe redd, That now does fflourish ffresh and gay: Confound his ffoes, Lord, wee beseeche, And loue His Grace both night and day! 167 SIR ANDREW BARTON Andrew Bartton SIR ANDREW BARTON—A Percy MS., p. 490; Hales and Furnivall, III, 399. 1 As itt beffell in m[i]dsumer-time, When burds singe sweetlye on euery tree, Our noble king, King Henery the Eighth, Ouer the riuer of Thames past hee. 2 Hee was no sooner ouer the riuer, Downe in a fforrest to take the ayre, But eighty merchants of London cittye Came kneeling before King Henery there. 3 ‘O yee are welcome, rich merchants, [Good saylers, welcome unto me!’] They swore by the rood the were saylers good, But rich merchants they cold not bee. 4 ‘To Ffrance nor Fflanders dare we nott passe, Nor Burdeaux voyage wee dare not ffare, And all ffor a ffalse robber that lyes on the seas, And robb[s] vs of our merchants-ware.’ 5 King Henery was stout, and he turned him about, And swore by the Lord that was mickle of might, ‘I thought he had not beene in the world throughout That durst haue wrought England such vnright.’ 6 But euer they sighed, and said, alas! Vnto King Harry this answere againe: ‘He is a proud Scott that will robb vs all If wee were twenty shipps and hee but one.’ 7 The king looket ouer his left shoulder, Amongst his lords and barrons soe ffree: ‘Haue I neuer lord in all my realme Will ffeitch yond traitor vnto mee?’ 8 ‘Yes, that dare I!’ sayes my lord Chareles Howard, Neere to the king wheras hee did stand; ‘If that Your Grace will giue me leaue, My selfe wilbe the only man.’ 9 ‘Thou shalt haue six hundred men,’ saith our king, ‘And chuse them out of my realme soe ffree; Besids marriners and boyes, To guide the great shipp on the sea.’ 10 ‘I'le goe speake with Sir Andrew,’ sais Charles, my lord Haward; ‘Vpon the sea, if hee be there; I will bring him and his shipp to shore, Or before my prince I will neuer come neere.’ 11 The ffirst of all my lord did call, A noble gunner hee was one; This man was three score yeeres and ten, And Peeter Simon was his name. 12 ‘Peeter,’ sais hee, ‘I must sayle to the sea, To seeke out an enemye; God be my speed!’ Before all others I haue chosen thee; Of a hundred guners thoust be my head.’ 13 ‘My lord,’ sais hee, ‘if you haue chosen mee Of a hundred gunners to be the head, Hange me att your maine-mast tree If I misse my marke past three pence bread.’ 14 The next of all my lord he did call, A noble bowman hee was one; In Yorekeshire was this gentleman borne, And William Horsley was his name. 15 ‘Horsley,’ sayes hee, ‘I must sayle to the sea, To seeke out an enemye; God be my speede! Before all others I haue chosen thee; Of a hundred bowemen thoust be my head.’ 16 ‘My lord,’ sais hee, ‘if you haue chosen mee Of a hundred bowemen to be the head, Hang me att your mainemast-tree If I misse my market past twelue pence bread.’ 17 With pikes, and gunnes, and bowemen bold, This noble Howard is gone to the sea On the day before midsummer-euen, And out att Thames mouth sayled they. 18 They had not sayled dayes three Vpon their iourney they tooke in hand, But there they mett with a noble shipp, And stoutely made itt both stay and stand. 19 ‘Thou must tell me thy name,’ sais Charles, my lord Haward, ‘Or who thou art, or ffrom whence thou came, Yea, and where thy dwelling is, To whom and where thy shipp does belong.’ 20 ‘My name,’ sayes hee, ‘is Henery Hunt, With a pure hart and a penitent mind; I and my shipp they doe belong Vnto the New-castle that stands vpon Tine.’ 21 ‘Now thou must tell me, Harry Hunt, As thou hast sayled by day and by night, Hast thou not heard of a stout robber? Men calls him Sir Andrew Bartton, knight.’ 22 But euer he sighed, and sayd, Alas! Ffull well, my lord, I know that wight; He robd me of my merchants ware, And I was his prisoner but yesternight. 23 As I was sayling vppon the sea, And [a] Burdeaux voyage as I did ffare, He clasped me to his archborde, And robd me of all my merchants-ware. 24 And I am a man both poore and bare, And euery man will haue his owne of me, And I am bound towards London to ffare, To complaine to my prince Henerye. 25 ‘That shall not need,’ sais my lord Haward; ‘If thou canst lett me this robber see, Ffor euery peny he hath taken thee ffroe, Thou shalt be rewarded a shilling,’ quoth hee. 26 ‘Now God fforefend,’ saies Henery Hunt, ‘My lord, you shold worke soe ffarr amisse! God keepe you out of that traitors hands! For you wott ffull litle what a man hee is. 27 ‘Hee is brasse within, and steele without, And beames hee beares in his topcastle stronge; His shipp hath ordinance cleane round about; Besids, my lord, hee is verry well mand. 28 ‘He hath a pinnace, is deerlye dight, Saint Andrews crosse, that is his guide; His pinnace beares nine score men and more, Besids fifteen cannons on euery side. 29 ‘If you were twenty shippes, and he but one, Either in archbord or in hall, He wold ouercome you euerye one, And if his beames they doe downe ffall.’ 30 ‘This is cold comfort,’ sais my Lord Haward, ‘To wellcome a stranger thus to the sea; I'le bring him and his shipp to shore, Or else into Scottland hee shall carrye mee.’ 31 ‘Then you must gett a noble gunner, my lord, That can sett well with his eye, And sinke his pinnace into the sea, And soone then ouercome will hee bee. 32 ‘And when that you haue done this, If you chance Sir Andrew for to bord, Lett no man to his topcastle goe; And I will giue you a glasse, my lord, 33 ‘And then you need to ffeare no Scott, Whether you sayle by day or by night; And to-morrow, by seuen of the clocke, You shall meete with Sir Andrew Bartton, knight. 34 ‘I was his prisoner but yester night, And he hath taken mee sworne,’ quoth hee; ‘I trust my L[ord] God will me fforgiue And if that oath then broken bee. 35 ‘You must lend me sixe peeces, my lord,’ quoth hee, ‘Into my shipp, to sayle the sea, And to-morrow, by nine of the clocke, Your Honour againe then will I see.’ 36 And the hache-bord where Sir Andrew lay Is hached with gold deerlye dight: ‘Now by my ffaith,’ sais Charles, my lord Haward, ‘Then yonder Scott is a worthye wight! 37 ‘Take in your ancyents and your standards, Yea that no man shall them see, And put me fforth a white willow wand, As merchants vse to sayle the sea.’ 38 But they stirred neither top nor mast, But Sir Andrew they passed by: ‘Whatt English are yonder,’ said Sir Andrew, ‘That can so litle curtesye? 39 ‘I haue beene admirall ouer the sea More then these yeeres three; There is neuer an English dog, nor Portingall, Can passe this way without leaue of mee. 40 ‘But now yonder pedlers, they are past, Which is no litle greffe to me: Ffeich them backe,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, ‘They shall all hang att my maine-mast tree.’ 41 With that the pinnace itt shott of, That my Lord Haward might itt well ken; Itt stroke downe my lords fforemast, And killed fourteen of my lord his men. 42 ‘Come hither, Simon!’ sayes my lord Haward, ‘Looke that thy words be true thou sayd; I'le hang thee att my maine-mast tree If thou misse thy marke past twelue pence bread.’ 43 Simon was old, but his hart itt was bold; Hee tooke downe a peece, and layd itt ffull lowe; He put in chaine yeards nine, Besids other great shott lesse and more. 44 With that hee lett his gun-shott goe; Soe well hee settled itt with his eye, The ffirst sight that Sir Andrew sawe, Hee see his pinnace sunke in the sea. 45 When hee saw his pinace sunke, Lord! in his hart hee was not well: ‘Cutt my ropes! itt is time to be gon! I'le goe ffeitch yond pedlers backe my selfe!’ 46 When my lord Haward saw Sir Andrew loose, Lord! in his hart that hee was ffaine: ‘Strike on your drummes! spread out your ancyents! Sound out your trumpetts! sound out amaine!’ 47 ‘Ffight on, my men!’ sais Sir Andrew Bartton; ‘Weate, howsoeuer this geere will sway, Itt is my lord Adm[i]rall of England Is come to seeke mee on the sea.’ 48 Simon had a sonne; with shott of a gunn— Well Sir Andrew might itt ken— He shott itt in att a priuye place, And killed sixty more of Sir Andrews men. 49 Harry Hunt came in att the other syde, And att Sir Andrew hee shott then; He droue downe his fformast-tree, And killed eighty more of Sir Andriwes men. 50 ‘I haue done a good turne,’ sayes Harry Hunt; ‘Sir Andrew is not our kings ffreind; He hoped to haue vndone me yesternight, But I hope I haue quitt him well in the end.’ 51 ‘Euer alas!’ sayd Sir Andrew Barton, ‘What shold a man either thinke or say? Yonder ffalse theeffe is my strongest enemye, Who was my prisoner but yesterday. 52 ‘Come hither to me, thou Gourden good, And be thou readye att my call, And I will giue thee three hundred pound If thou wilt lett my beames downe ffall.’ 53 With that hee swarued the maine-mast tree, Soe did he itt with might and maine; Horseley, with a bearing arrow, Stroke the Gourden through the braine. 54 And he ffell into the haches againe, And sore of this wound that he did bleed; Then word went throug Sir Andrews men, That the Gourden hee was dead. 55 ‘Come hither to me, Iames Hambliton, Thou art my sisters sonne, I haue no more; I will giue [thee] six hundred pound If thou will lett my beames downe ffall.’ 56 With that hee swarued the maine-mast tree, Soe did hee itt with might and maine: Horseley, with another broad arrow, Strake the yeaman through the braine. 57 That hee ffell downe to the haches againe; Sore of his wound that hee did bleed; Couetousness getts no gaine, Itt is verry true, as the Welchman sayd. 58 But when hee saw his sisters sonne slaine, Lord! in his heart hee was not well: ‘Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of proue, Ffor I will to the topcastle my-selfe. 59 ‘Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe, For itt is guilded with gold soe cleere; God be with my brother, Iohn of Bartton! Amongst the Portingalls hee did itt weare.’ 60 But when hee had his armour of prooffe, And on his body hee had itt on, Euery man that looked att him Sayd, Gunn nor arrow hee neede feare none. 61 ‘Come hither, Horsley!’ sayes my lord Haward, ‘And looke your shaft that itt goe right; Shoot a good shoote in the time of need, And ffor thy shooting thoust be made a knight.’ 62 ‘I'le doe my best,’ sayes Horslay then, ‘Your Honor shall see beffore I goe; If I shold be hanged att your mainemast, I haue in my shipp but arrowes tow.’ 63 But att Sir Andrew hee shott then; Hee made sure to hitt his marke; Vnder the spole of his right arme Hee smote Sir Andrew quite throw the hart. 64 Yett ffrom the tree hee wold not start, But hee clinged to itt with might and maine; Vnder the coller then of his iacke, He stroke Sir Andrew thorrow the braine. 65 ‘Ffight on my men,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, ‘I am hurt, but I am not slaine; I'le lay mee downe and bleed a-while, And then I'le rise and ffight againe. 66 ‘Ffight on my men,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, ‘These English doggs they bite soe lowe; Ffight on ffor Scottland and Saint Andrew Till you heare my whistle blowe!’ 67 But when the cold not heare his whistle blow, Sayes Harry Hunt, I'le lay my head You may bord yonder noble shipp, my lord, For I know Sir Andrew hee is dead. 68 With that they borded this noble shipp, Soe did they itt with might and maine; The ffound eighteen score Scotts aliue, Besids the rest were maimed and slaine. 69 My lord Haward tooke a sword in his hand, And smote of Sir Andrews head; The Scotts stood by did weepe and mourne, But neuer a word durst speake or say. 70 He caused his body to be taken downe, And ouer the hatch-bord cast into the sea, And about his middle three hundred crownes: ‘Whersoeuer thou lands, itt will bury thee.’ 71 With his head they sayled into England againe, With right good will, and fforce and main, And the day beffore Newyeeres euen Into Thames mouth they came againe. 72 My lord Haward wrote to King Heneryes grace, With all the newes hee cold him bring: ‘Such a Newyeeres gifft I haue brought to your Gr[ace] As neuer did subiect to any king. 73 ‘Ffor merchandyes and manhood, The like is nott to be ffound; The sight of these wold doe you good, Ffor you haue not the like in your English ground.’ 74 But when hee heard tell that they were come, Full royally hee welcomed them home; Sir Andrews shipp was the kings Newyeeres guifft; A brauer shipp you neuer saw none. 75 Now hath our king Sir Andrews shipp, Besett with pearles and precyous stones; Now hath England two shipps of warr, Two shipps of warr, before but one. 76 ‘Who holpe to this?’ sayes King Henerye, ‘That I may reward him ffor his paine:’ ‘Harry Hunt, and Peeter Simon, William Horseleay, and I the same.’ 77 ‘Harry Hunt shall haue his whistle and chaine, And all his iewells, whatsoeuer they bee, And other rich giffts that I will not name, For his good service he hath done mee. 78 ‘Horslay, right thoust be a knight, Lands and liuings thou shalt haue store; Howard shalbe erle of Nottingham, And soe was neuer Haward before. 79 ‘Now, Peeter Simon, thou art old; I will maintaine thee and thy sonne; Thou shalt haue fiue hundred pound all in gold Ffor the good service that thou hast done.’ 80 Then King Henerye shiffted his roome; In came the Queene and ladyes bright; Other arrands they had none But to see Sir Andrew Bartton, knight. 81 But when they see his deadly fface, His eyes were hollow in his head; ‘I wold giue a hundred pound,’ sais King Henerye, ‘The man were aliue as hee is dead! 82 ‘Yett ffor the manfull part that hee hath playd, Both heere and beyond the sea, His men shall haue halfe a crowne a day To bring them to my brother, King Iamye.’ The Life and Death of Sir Andrew Barton; or, Sir Andrew Barton SIR ANDREW BARTON—B a.

Over the river of Thames past he, Unto a mountain-top also Did walk, some pleasure for to see. 3 Where forty merchants he espy'd, With fifty sail, come towards him, Who then no sooner were arriv'd, But on their knees did thus complain. 4 ‘An't please Your Grace, we cannot sail To France no voyage, to be sure, But Sir Andrew Barton makes us quail, And robs us of our merchant-ware.’ 5 Vext was the king, and turned him, Said to the lords of high degree, Have I ner a lord within my realm Dare fetch that traytor unto me? 6 To him repli'd Lord Charles Howard: I will, my liege, with heart and hand; If it please you grant me leave, he said, I will perform what you command. 7 To him then spake King Henry: I fear, my lord, you are too young. ‘No whit at all, my liege,’ quoth he; ‘I hope to prove in valour strong. 8 ‘The Scottish knight I vow to seek, In what place soever he be, And bring a shore, with all his might, Or into Scotland he shall carry me.’ 9 ‘A hundred men,’ the king then said, ‘Out of my realm shall chosen be, Besides saylors and ship-boys To guide a great ship on the sea. 10 ‘Bow-men and gunners of good skill Shall for this service chosen be, And they at thy command and will In all affairs shall wait on thee.’ 11 Lord Howard calld a gunner then Who was the best in all the realm; His age was threescore years and ten, And Peter Simon was his name. 12 My lord calld then a bow-man rare, Whose active hands had gained fame, A gentleman born in Yorkshire, And William Horsly was his name. 13 ‘Horsly,’ quoth he, ‘I must to sea, To seek a traytor, with great speed; Of a hundred bow-men brave,’ quoth he, ‘I have chosen thee to be the head.’ 14 ‘If you, my lord, have chosen me Of a hundred men to be the head, Upon the main-mast I'le hanged be, If twelve-score I miss one shillings breadth.’ 15 Lord Howard then, of courage bold, Went to the sea with pleasant chear, Not curbd with winters piercing cold, Though it was the stormy time of the year. 16 Not long he had been on the sea, No more in days then number three, Till one Henry Hunt he there espied, A merchant of Newcastle was he. 17 To him Lord Howard cald out amain, And strictly charged him to stand; Demanding then from whence he came, Or where he did intend to land. 18 The merchant then made him answer soon, With heavy heart and careful mind, ‘My lord, my ship it doth belong Unto Newcastle upon Tine.’ 19 ‘Canst thou shew me,’ the lord did say, ‘As thou didst sail by day and night, A Scottish rover on the sea, His name is Andrew Barton, knight?’ 20 Then to him the merchant sighd and said, With grieved mind and well a way, ‘But over well I know that wight, I was his prisoner but yesterday. 21 ‘As I, my lord, did pass from France, A Burdeaux voyage to take so far, I met with Sir Andrew Barton thence, Who robd me of my merchant-ware. 22 ‘And mickle debts, God knows, I owe, And every man did crave his own; And I am bound to London now, Of our gracious king to beg a boon.’ 23 ‘Shew me him,’ said [Lord] Howard then, ‘Let me but once the villain see, And one penny he hath from the tane, I'le double the same with shillings three.’ 24 ‘Now, God forbid,’ the merchant said; ‘I fear your aim that you will miss; God bless you from his tyranny, For little you know what man he is. 25 ‘He is brass within and steel without, His ship most huge and mighty strong, With eighteen pieces strong and stout, He carrieth on each side along. 26 ‘With beams for his top-castle, As also being huge and high, That neither English nor Portugal Can pass Sir Andrew Barton by.’ 27 ‘Hard news thou shewst,’ then said the lord, ‘To welcome strangers to the sea; But, as I said, I'le bring him aboard, Or into Scotland he shall carry me.’ 28 The merchant said, If you will do so, Take counsel, then, I pray withal: Let no man to his top-castle go, Nor strive to let his beam[s] down fall. 29 ‘Lend me seven pieces of ordnance then, Of each side of my ship,’ quoth he, ‘And to-morrow, my lord, twixt six and seven, Again I will Your Honour see. 30 ‘A glass I'le set that may be seen Whether you sail by day or night; And to-morrow, be sure, before seven, You shall see Sir Andrew Barton, knight.’ 31 The merchant set my lord a glass, So well apparent in his sight That on the morrow, as his promise was, He saw Sir Andrew Barton, knight. 32 The lord then swore a mighty oath, ‘Now by the heavens that be of might, By faith, believe me, and by troth, I think he is a worthy knight. 33 ‘Fetch me my lyon out of hand,’ Saith the lord, ‘with rose and streamer high; Set up withal a willow-wand, That merchant-like I [may] pass by.’ 34 Thus bravely did Lord Howard pass, And did on anchor rise so high; No top-sail at all he cast, But as his foe he did him defie. 35 Sir Andrew Barton seeing him Thus scornfully to pass by, As though he cared not a pin For him and all his company, 36 Then called he his men amain, ‘Fetch back yon pedler now,’ quoth he, ‘And against this way he comes again I'le teach him well his courtesie.’ 37 A piece of ordnance soon was shot By this proud pirate fiercely then Into Lord Howards middle deck, Which cruel shot killd fourteen men. 38 He calld then Peter Simon, he: ‘Look now thy word do stand in stead, For thou shalt be hanged on main-mast If thou miss twelve score one penny breadth.’ 39 Then Peter Simon gave a shot Which did Sir Andrew mickle scare, In at his deck it came so hot, Killd fifteen of his men of war. 40 ‘Alas!’ then said the pyrate stout, ‘I am in danger now, I see; This is some lord, I greatly doubt, That is set on to conquer me.’ 41 Then Henry Hunt, with rigor hot, Came bravely on the other side, Who likewise shot in at his deck, And kild fifty of his men beside. 42 Then ‘Out, alas!’ Sir Andrew cri'd, ‘What may a man now think or say! Yon merchant thief that pierceth me, He was my prisoner yesterday.’ 43 Then did he on Gordion call, Unto top-castle for to go, And bid his beams he should let fall, ‘For I greatly fear an overthrow.’ 44 The lord cald Horsly now in hast: ‘Look that thy word stand now in stead, For thou shalt be hanged on main-mast If thou miss twelve score one shillings breadth.’ 45 Then up [the] mast-tree swarved he, This stout and mighty Gordion; But Horsly, he most happily Shot him under the collar-bone. 46 Then calld he on his nephew then, Said, Sisters sons I have no mo; Three hundred pound I will give thee, If thou wilt to top-castle go. 47 Then stoutly he began to climb, From off the mast scornd to depart; But Horsly soon prevented him, And deadly piercd him to the heart. 48 His men being slain, then up amain Did this proud pyrate climb with speed, For armour of proof he had put on, And did not dint of arrow dread. 49 ‘Come hither, Horsly,’ said the lord, ‘See thine arrow aim aright; Great means to thee I will afford, And if you speed, I'le make you a knight.’ 50 Sir Andrew did climb up the tree, With right good will and all his main; Then upon the breast hit Horsly he, Till the arrow did return again. 51 Then Horsly spied a private place, With a perfect eye, in a secret part; His arrow swiftly flew apace, And smote Sir Andrew to the heart. 52 ‘Fight on, fight on, my merry men all, A little I am hurt, yet not slain; I'le but lie down and bleed a while, And come and fight with you again. 53 ‘And do not,’ he said, ‘fear English rogues, And of your foes stand not in awe, But stand fast by St Andrews cross, Until you hear my whistle blow.’ 54 They never heard his whistle blow, Which made them [all] sore afraid: Then Horsly said, My lord, aboard, For now Sir Andrew Barton's dead. 55 Thus boarded they this gallant ship, With right good will and all their main, Eighteen score Scots alive in it, Besides as many more were slain. 56 The lord went where Sir Andrew lay, And quickly thence cut off his head: ‘I should forsake England many a day, If thou wert alive as thou art dead.’ 57 Thus from the wars Lord Howard came, With mickle joy and triumphing; The pyrates head he brought along For to present unto our king: 58 Who briefly then to him did say, Before he knew well what was done, ‘Where is the knight and pyrate gay? That I my self may give the doom.’ 59 ‘You may thank God,’ then said the lord, ‘And four men in the ship,’ quoth he, ‘That we are safely come ashore, Sith you had never such an enemy: 60 ‘That is Henry Hunt, and Peter Simon, William Horsly, and Peters son; Therefore reward them for their pains, For they did service at their turn.’ 61 To the merchant then the king did say, ‘In lue of what he hath from the tane, I give to the a noble a day, Sir Andrews whistle and his chain: 62 ‘To Peter Simon a crown a day, And half-a-crown a day to Peters son, And that was for a shot so gay, Which bravely brought Sir Andrew down. 63 ‘Horsly, I will make thee a knight, And in Yorkshire thou shalt dwell: Lord Howard shall Earl Bury hight, For this title he deserveth well. 64 ‘Seven shillings to our English men, Who in this fight did stoutly stand, And twelve pence a-day to the Scots, till they Come to my brother kings high land.’ 168 FLODDEN FIELD FLODDEN FIELD From Deloney's Pleasant History of John Winchcomb, in his younger yeares called Jacke of Newberie, etc., London, 1633; reprinted by J.

That he will be at lovely London Upon Saint James his day. 2 ‘Upon Saint James his day at noone, At faire London will I be, And all the lords in merrie Scotland, They shall dine there with me.’ 3 Then bespake good Queene Margaret, The teares fell from her eye: ‘Leave off these warres, most noble king, Keepe your fidelitie. 4 ‘The water runnes swift and wondrous deepe, From bottome unto the brimme; My brother Henry hath men good enough; England is hard to winne.’ 5 ‘Away,’ quoth he, ‘with this silly foole! In prison fast let her lie: For she is come of the English bloud, And for these words she shall dye.’ 6 With that bespake Lord Thomas Howard, The queenes chamberlaine that day: ‘If that you put Queene Margaret to death, Scotland shall rue it alway.’ 7 Then in a rage King Jamie did say, ‘Away with this foolish mome! He shall be hanged, and the other be burned, So soone as I come home.’ 8 At Flodden Field the Scots came in, Which made our English men faine; At Bramstone Greene this battaile was seene, There was King Jamie slaine. 9 Then presently the Scots did flie, Their cannons they left behind; Their ensignes gay were won all away, Our souldiers did beate them blinde. 10 To tell you plaine, twelve thousand were slaine That to the fight did stand, And many prisoners tooke that day, The best in all Scotland. 11 That day made many [a] fatherlesse child, And many a widow poore, And many a Scottish gay lady Sate weeping in her bower. 12 Jack with a feather was lapt all in leather, His boastings were all in vaine; He had such a chance, with a new morrice-dance, He never went home againe. 169 JOHNIE ARMSTRONG A Northern Ballet; or, A Northern Ballad JOHNIE ARMSTRONG—A a.

Saying, Asking grace of a graceles face — Why there is none for you nor me. 12 But Ionnë had a bright sword by his side, And it was made of the mettle so free, That had not the king stept his foot aside, He had smitten his head from his faire boddë. 13 Saying, Fight on, my merry men all, And see that none of you be taine; For rather then men shall say we were hange'd, Let them report how we were slaine. 14 Then, God wott, faire Eddenburrough rose, And so besett poore Ionnë rounde, That fowerscore and tenn of Ionnës best men Lay gasping all upon the ground. 15 Then like a mad man Ionnë laide about, And like a mad man then fought hee, Untill a falce Scot came Ionnë behinde, And runn him through the faire boddee. 16 Saying, Fight on, my merry men all, And see that none of you be taine; For I will stand by and bleed but awhile, And then will I come and fight againe. 17 Newes then was brought to young Ionnë Armestrong, As he stood by his nurses knee, Who vowed if ere he live'd for to be a man, O the treacherous Scots revengd hee'd be.

Scotland is so full of their traitery. 2 Yes, there is a man in Westmerland, And John Armstrong some do him call; He has no lands nor rents coming in, Yet he keeps eightscore men within his hall. 3 He has horse and harness for them all, And goodly steeds that be milk-white, With their goodly belts about their necks, With hats and feathers all alike. 4 The king he writ a lovely letter, With his own hand so tenderly, And has sent it unto John Armstrong, To come and speak with him speedily. 5 When John he looked the letter upon, Then, Lord! he was as blithe as a bird in a tree: ‘I was never before no king in my life, My father, my grandfather, nor none of us three. 6 ‘But seeing we must [go] before the king, Lord! we will go most valiantly; You shall every one have a velvet coat, Laid down with golden laces three. 7 ‘And you shall every one have a scarlet cloak, Laid down with silver laces five, With your golden belts about your necks, With hats [and] brave feathers all alike.’ 8 But when John he went from Guiltknock Hall! The wind it blew hard, and full sore it did rain: ‘Now fare you well, brave Guiltknock Hall! I fear I shall never see thee again.’ 9 Now John he is to Edenborough gone, And his eightscore men so gallantly, And every one of them on a milk-white steed, With their bucklers and swords hanging down to the knee. 10 But when John he came the king before, With his eightscore men so gallant to see, The king he moved his bonnet to him; He thought he had been a king as well as he. 11 ‘O pardon, pardon, my soveraign leige, Pardon for my eightscore men and me! For my name it is John Armstrong, And a subject of yours, my leige,’ said he. 12 ‘Away with thee, thou false traitor! No pardon I will grant to thee, But, to-morrow before eight of the clock, I will hang thy eightscore men and thee.’ 13 O how John looked over his left shoulder! And to his merry men thus said he: I have asked grace of a graceless face, No pardon here is for you nor me. 14 Then John pulld out a nut-brown sword, And it was made of mettle so free; Had not the king moved his foot as he did, John had taken his head from his body. 15 ‘Come, follow me, my merry men all, We will scorn one foot away to fly; It never shall be said we were hung like doggs; No, wee'l fight it out most manfully.’ 16 Then they fought on like champions bold — For their hearts was sturdy, stout, and free — Till they had killed all the kings good guard; There was none left alive but onely three. 17 But then rise up all Edenborough, They rise up by thousands three; Then a cowardly Scot came John behind, And run him thorow the fair body. 18 Said John, Fight on, my merry men all, I am a little hurt, but I am not slain; I will lay me down for to bleed a while, Then I'le rise and fight with you again. 19 Then they fought on like mad men all, Till many a man lay dead on the plain; For they were resolved, before they would yield, That every man would there be slain. 20 So there they fought couragiously, 'Till most of them lay dead there and slain, But little Musgrave, that was his foot-page, With his bonny grissell got away untain. 21 But when he came up to Guiltknock Hall, The lady spyed him presently: ‘What news, what news, thou little foot-page? What news from thy master and his company?’ 22 ‘My news is bad, lady,’ he said, ‘Which I do bring, as you may see; My master, John Armstrong, he is slain, And all his gallant company. 23 ‘Yet thou are welcome home, my bonny grisel! Full oft thou hast fed at the corn and hay, But now thou shalt be fed with bread and wine, And thy sides shall be spurred no more, I say.’ 24 O then bespoke his little son, As he was set on his nurses knee: ‘If ever I live for to be a man, My fathers blood revenged shall be.’ Johnie Armstrang JOHNIE ARMSTRONG—C Allan Ramsay, The Ever Green, II, 190, “copied from a gentleman's mouth of the name of Armstrang, who is the 6th generation from this John.” 1 Sum speiks of lords, sum speiks of lairds, And siclyke men of hie degrie; Of a gentleman I sing a sang, Sumtyme calld Laird of Gilnockie. 2 The king he wrytes a luving letter, With his ain hand sae tenderly: And he hath sent it to Johny Armstrang, To cum and speik with him speidily. 3 The Eliots and Armstrangs did convene, They were a gallant company: ‘We'ill ryde and meit our lawful king, And bring him safe to Gilnockie. 4 ‘Make kinnen and capon ready, then, And venison in great plenty; We'ill welcome hame our royal king; I hope he'ill dyne at Gilnockie!’ 5 They ran their horse on the Langum howm, And brake their speirs with mekle main; The ladys lukit frae their loft-windows, ‘God bring our men weil back again!’ 6 When Johny came before the king, With all his men sae brave to see, The king he movit his bonnet to him; He weind he was a king as well as he. 7 ‘May I find grace, my sovereign liege, Grace for my loyal men and me? For my name it is Johny Armstrang, And subject of yours, my liege,’ said he. 8 ‘Away, away, thou traytor, strang! Out of my sicht thou mayst sune be!

She wept and she waild till she fell in a swoond, They opend her two sides, and the baby was found. 5 The baby was christened with joy and much mirth, Whilst poor Queen Jane's body lay cold under earth: There was ringing and singing and mourning all day, The princess Eliz[abeth] went weeping away. 6 The trumpets in mourning so sadly did sound, And the pikes and the muskets did trail on the ground. Queen Jeanie THE DEATH OF QUEEN JANE—B Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 116. 1 Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, traveld six weeks and more, Till women and midwives had quite gien her oer: ‘O if ye were women as women should be, Ye would send for a doctor, a doctor to me.’ 2 The doctor was called for and set by her bedside: ‘What aileth thee, my ladie, thine eyes seem so red?’ ‘O doctor, O doctor, will ye do this for me, To rip up my two sides, and save my babie?’ 3 ‘Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, that's the thing I'll neer do, To rip up your two sides to save your babie:’ Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, traveld six weeks and more, Till midwives and doctors had quite gien her oer. 4 ‘O if ye were doctors as doctors should be, Ye would send for King Henry, King Henry to me:’ King Henry was called for, and sat by her bedside, ‘What aileth thee, Jeanie? what aileth my bride?’ 5 ‘King Henry, King Henry, will ye do this for me, To rip up my two sides, and save my babie?’ ‘Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, that's what I'll never do, To rip up your two sides to save your babie.’ 6 But with sighing and sobbing she's fallen in a swoon, Her side it was ript up, and her babie was found; At this bonie babie's christning there was meikle joy and mirth, But bonnie Queen Jeanie lies cold in the earth. 7 Six and six coaches, and six and six more, And royal King Henry went mourning before; O two and two gentlemen carried her away, But royal King Henry went weeping away. 8 O black were their stockings, and black were their bands, And black were the weapons they held in their hands; O black were their mufflers, and black were their shoes, And black were the cheverons they drew on their luves. 9 They mourned in the kitchen, and they mournd in the ha, But royal King Henry mournd langest of a': Farewell to fair England, farewell for evermore! For the fair flower of England will never shine more. THE DEATH OF QUEEN JANE—C a. Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 182; “from two fragments, one transmitted from Arbroath and another from Edinburgh.” b. Herd's MSS, I, 103. 1 Queen Jeany has traveld for three days and more, Till the ladies were weary, and quite gave her oer: ‘O ladies, O ladies, do this thing for me, To send for King Henry, to come and see me.’ 2 King Henry was sent for, and sat by her bedside: ‘Why weep you, Queen Jeany? your eyes are so red.’ ‘O Henry, O Henry, do this one thing for me, Let my side straight be opend, and save my babie!’ 3 ‘O Jeany, O Jeany, this never will do, It will leese thy sweet life, and thy young babie too.’ She wept and she wailed, till she fell in a swoon: Her side it was opened, the babie was found. 4 Prince Edward was christened with joy and with mirth, But the flower of fair England lies cold in the earth. O black was King Henry, and black were his men, And black was the steed that King Henry rode on. 5 And black were the ladies, and black were their fans, And black were the gloves that they wore on their hands, And black were the ribbands they wore on their heads, And black were the pages, and black were the maids. 6 The trumpets they sounded, the cannons did roar, But the flower of fair England shall flourish no more. The Death of Queen Jane THE DEATH OF QUEEN JANE—D Robert Bell's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England, p. 113; “taken down from the singing of a young gipsy girl, to whom it had descended orally through two generations.” 1 Queen Jane was in travail for six weeks or more, Till the women grew tired and fain would give oer: ‘O women, O women, good wives if ye be, Go send for King Henrie, and bring him to me!’ 2 King Henrie was sent for, he came with all speed, In a gownd of green velvet from heel to the head: ‘King Henrie, King Henrie, if kind Henrie you be, Send for a surgeon, and bring him to me!’ 3 The surgeon was sent for, he came with all speed, In a gownd of black velvet from heel to the head; He gave her rich caudle, but the death-sleep slept she, Then her right side was opened, and the babe was set free. 4 The babe it was christened, and put out and nursed, While the royal Queen Jane she lay cold in the dust. 5 So black was the mourning, and white were the wands, Yellow, yellow the torches they bore in their hands; The bells they were muffled, and mournful did play, While the royal Queen Jane she lay cold in the clay. 6 Six knights and six lords bore her corpse through the grounds, Six dukes followed after, in black mourning gownds; The flower of Old England was laid in cold clay, Whilst the royal King Henrie came weeping away.

And six weeks and a day in labour was she; Queen Jane was in labour for six weeks and more, Till the women grew weary and fain would give oer. 2 ‘O women, O women, good wives as ye be, Go send for King Henry and bring him to me.’ King Henry was sent for, and to her he came: ‘Dear lady, fair lady, your eyes they look dim.’ 3 King Henry came to her, he came in all speed, In a gown of red velvet, from the heel to the head: ‘King Henry, King Henry, if kind you will be, Send for a good doctor, and let him come to me.’ 4 The doctor was sent for, he came with all speed, In a gown of black velvet from the heel to the head; The doctor was sent for and to her he came: ‘Dear lady, fair lady, your labour's in vain.’ 5 ‘Dear doctor, dear doctor, will you do this for me? O open my right side, and save my baby:’ Then out spake King Henry, That never can be, I'd rather lose the branches than the top of the tree. 6 The doctor gave a caudle, the death-sleep slept she, Then her right side was opened and the babe was set free; The babe it was christened, and put out and nursd, But the royal Queen Jane lay cold in the dust.

For ye'll get nae mair of me. 6 Queen Mary came tripping down the stair, Wi the gold strings in her hair: ‘O whare's the little babie,’ she says, ‘That I heard greet sae sair?’ 7 ‘O hold your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame, Let all those words go free! It was mysell wi a fit o the sair colic, I was sick just like to die.’ 8 ‘O hold your tongue, Mary Hamilton, Let all those words go free! O where is the little babie That I heard weep by thee?’ 9 ‘I rowed it in my handkerchief, And threw it in the sea; I bade it sink, I bade it swim, It would get nae mair o me.’ 10 ‘O wae be to thee, Marie Hamilton, And an ill deid may you die! For if ye had saved the babie's life It might hae been an honour to thee. 11 ‘Busk ye, busk ye, Marie Hamilton, O busk ye to be a bride! For I am going to Edinburgh toun, Your gay wedding to bide. 12 ‘You must not put on your robes of black, Nor yet your robes of brown; But you must put on your yellow gold stuffs, To shine thro Edinburgh town.’ 13 ‘I will not put on my robes of black, Nor yet my robes of brown; But I will put on my yellow gold stuffs, To shine thro Edinburgh town.’ 14 As she went up the Parliament Close, A riding on her horse, There she saw many a cobler's lady, Sat greeting at the cross. 15 ‘O what means a' this greeting? I'm sure its nae for me; For I'm come this day to Edinburgh town Weel wedded for to be.’ 16 When she gade up the Parliament stair, She gied loud lauchters three; But ere that she came down again, She was condemned to die. 17 ‘O little did my mother think, The day that she prinned my gown, That I was to come sae far frae hame To be hangid in Edinburgh town. 18 ‘O what'll my poor father think, As he comes thro the town, To see the face of his Molly fair Hanging on the gallows-pin! 19 ‘Here's a health to the marineres, That plough the raging main! Let neither my mother nor father know But I'm coming hame again! 20 ‘Here's a health to the sailors, That sail upon the sea! Let neither my mother nor father ken That I came here to die! 21 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Maries, This night she'll hae but three; There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton, And Mary Carmichael, and me.’ 22 ‘O hald your tongue, Mary Hamilton, Let all those words go free! This night eer ye be hanged Ye shall gang hame wi me.’ 23 ‘O hald your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame, Let all those words go free! For since I have come to Edinburgh toun, It's hanged I shall be, And it shall neer be said that in your court I was condemned to die.’ Lady Maisry MARY HAMILTON—E Buchan's MSS, II, 186. 1 ‘My father was the Duke of York, My mother a lady free, Mysell a dainty damsell, Queen Mary sent for me. 2 ‘Yestreen I washd Queen Mary's feet, Kam'd down her yellow hair, And lay a' night in the young man's bed, And I'll rue t for evermair. 3 ‘The queen's kale was aye sae het, Her spice was aye sae fell, Till they gart me gang to the young man's bed, And I'd a' the wyte mysell. 4 ‘I was not in the queen's service A twelvemonth but barely ane, Ere I grew as big wi bairn As ae woman could gang. 5 ‘But it fell ance upon a day, Was aye to be it lane, I did take strong travilling As ever yet was seen.’ 6 Ben it came the queen hersell, Was a' gowd to the hair; ‘O where's the bairn, Lady Maisry, That I heard greeting sair?’ 7 Ben it came the queen hersell, Was a' gowd to the chin: ‘O where's the bairn, Lady Maisry, That I heard late yestreen.’ 8 ‘There is no bairn here,’ she says, ‘Nor never thinks to be; 'Twas but a stoun o sair sickness That ye heard seizing me.’ 9 They sought it out, they sought it in, They sought it but and ben, But between the bolster and the bed They got the baby slain. 10 ‘Come busk ye, busk ye, Lady Maisdry, Come busk, an go with me; For I will on to Edinburgh, And try the verity.’ 11 She woud not put on the black, the black, Nor yet wad she the brown, But the white silk and the red scarlet, That shin'd frae town to town. 12 As she gaed down thro Edinburgh town The burghers' wives made meen, That sic a dainty damsel Sud ever hae died for sin. 13 ‘Make never meen for me,’ she says, ‘Make never meen for me; Seek never grace frae a graceless face, For that ye'll never see.’ 14 As she gaed up the Tolbooth stair, A light laugh she did gie; But lang ere she came down again She was condemned to die. 15 ‘A’ you that are in merchants-ships, And cross the roaring faem, Hae nae word to my father and mother, But that I'm coming hame. 16 ‘Hold your hands, ye justice o peace, Hold them a little while! For yonder comes my father and mother, That's travelld mony a mile. 17 ‘Gie me some o your gowd, parents, Some o your white monie, To save me frae the head o yon hill, Yon greenwood gallows-tree.’ 18 ‘Ye'll get nane o our gowd, daughter, Nor nane o our white monie; For we hae travelld mony a mile, This day to see you die.’ 19 ‘Hold your hands, ye justice o peace, Hold them a little while! For yonder comes him Warenston, The father of my chile. 20 ‘Give me some o your gowd, Warenston, Some o your white monie, To save me frae the head o yon hill, Yon greenwood gallows-tree.’ 21 ‘I bade you nurse my bairn well, And nurse it carefullie, And gowd shoud been your hire, Maisry, And my body your fee.’ 22 He's taen out a purse o gowd, Another o white monie, And he's tauld down ten thousand crowns, Says, True love, gang wi me.

Oh never let on to my father and mither The death that I maun dee! 14 ‘An I charge ye, all ye mariners, When ye sail owre the main, Let neither my father nor mither know But that I'm comin hame. 15 ‘Oh little did my mither ken, That day she cradled me, What lands I was to tread in, Or what death I should dee. 16 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The nicht she'll hae but three; There's Marie Seaton, an Marie Beaton, An Marie Carmichael, an me.’ Mary Hamilton MARY HAMILTON—H Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 252; a North Country version. 1 ‘Whan I was a babe, and a very little babe, And stood at my mither's knee, Nae witch nor warlock did unfauld The death I was to dree. 2 ‘But my mither was a proud woman, A proud woman and a bauld; And she hired me to Queen Mary's bouer, When scarce eleven years auld. 3 ‘O happy, happy is the maid, That's born of beauty free! It was my dimpling rosy cheeks That's been the dule o me; And wae be to that weirdless wicht, And a' his witcherie!’ 4 Word's gane up and word's gane doun, An word's gane to the ha, That Mary Hamilton was wi bairn, An na body kend to wha. 5 But in and cam the queen hersel, Wi gowd plait on her hair: Says, Mary Hamilton, whare is the babe That I heard greet sae sair? 6 ‘There is na babe within my bouer, And I hope there neer will be; But it's me wi a sair and sick colic, And I'm just like to dee.’ 7 But they looked up, they looked down, Atween the bowsters and the wa, It's there they got a bonnie lad-bairn, But its life it was awa. 8 ‘Rise up, rise up, Mary Hamilton, Rise up, and dress ye fine, For you maun gang to Edinbruch, And stand afore the nine. 9 ‘Ye'll no put on the dowie black, Nor yet the dowie brown; But ye'll put on the robes o red, To sheen thro Edinbruch town.’ 10 ‘I'll no put on the dowie black, Nor yet the dowie brown; But I'll put on the robes o red, To sheen thro Edinbruch town.’ 11 As they gaed thro Edinbruch town, And down by the Nether-bow, There war monie a lady fair Siching and crying, Och how! 12 ‘O weep na mair for me, ladies, Weep na mair for me! Yestreen I killed my ain bairn, The day I deserve to dee. 13 ‘What need ye hech and how, ladies? What need ye how for me? Ye never saw grace at a graceless face, Queen Mary has nane to gie.’ 14 ‘Gae forward, gae forward,’ the queen she said, ‘Gae forward, that ye may see; For the very same words that ye hae said Sall hang ye on the gallows-tree.’ 15 As she gaed up the Tolbooth stairs, She gied loud lauchters three; But or ever she cam down again, She was condemnd to dee. 16 ‘O tak example frae me, Maries, O tak example frae me, Nor gie your luve to courtly lords, Nor heed their witchin'ee. 17 ‘But wae be to the Queen hersel, She micht hae pardond me; But sair she's striven for me to hang Upon the gallows-tree. 18 ‘Yestreen the Queen had four Maries, The nicht she'll hae but three; There was Mary Beatoun, Mary Seaton, And Mary Carmichael, and me. 19 ‘Aft hae I set pearls in her hair, Aft hae I lac'd her gown, And this is the reward I now get, To be hangd in Edinbruch town! 20 ‘O a' ye mariners, far and near, That sail ayont the faem, O dinna let my father and mither ken But what I am coming hame! 21 ‘O a' ye mariners, far and near, That sail ayont the sea, Let na my father and mither ken The death I am to dee! 22 ‘Sae, weep na mair for me, ladies, Weep na mair for me; The mither that kills her ain bairn Deserves weel for to dee.’ The Queen's Marie MARY HAMILTON—I a. Scott's Minstrelsy, 1833, III, 294, made up from various copies. b. Three stanzas (23, 18, 19) in the first edition of the Minstrelsy, 1802, II, 154, from recitation. 1 Marie Hamilton's to the kirk gane, Wi ribbons in her hair; The king thought mair o Marie Hamilton Than ony that were there. 2 Marie Hamilton's to the kirk gane, Wi ribbons on her breast; The king thought mair o Marie Hamilton Then he listend to the priest. 3 Marie Hamilton's to the kirk gane, Wi gloves upon her hands; The king thought mair o Marie Hamilton, Than the queen and a' her lands. 4 She hadna been about the king's court A month, but barely one, Till she was beloved by a' the king's court, And the king the only man. 5 She hadna been about the king's court A month, but barely three, Till frae the king's court Marie Hamilton, Marie Hamilton durstna be. 6 The king is to the Abbey gane, To pu the Abbey-tree, To scale the babe frae Marie's heart, But the thing it wadna be. 7 O she has rowd it in her apron, And set it on the sea: ‘Gae sink ye, or swim ye, bonny babe! Ye's get nae mair o me.’ 8 Word is to the kitchen gane, And word is to the ha, And word is to the noble room, Amang the ladyes a', That Marie Hamilton's brought to bed, And the bonny babe's mist and awa. 9 Scarcely had she lain down again, And scarcely fa'en asleep, When up then started our gude queen, Just at her bed-feet, Saying, Marie Hamilton, where's your babe? For I am sure I heard it greet. 10 ‘O no, O no, my noble queen, Think no such thing to be! 'Twas but a stitch into my side, And sair it troubles me.’ 11 ‘Get up, get up, Marie Hamilton, Get up and follow me; For I am going to Edinburgh town, A rich wedding for to see.’ 12 O slowly, slowly raise she up, And slowly put she on, And slowly rode she out the way, Wi mony a weary groan. 13 The queen was clad in scarlet, Her merry maids all in green, And every town that they cam to, They took Marie for the queen. 14 ‘Ride hooly, hooly, gentlemen, Ride hooly now wi me! For never, I am sure, a wearier burd Rade in your cumpanie.’ 15 But little wist Marie Hamilton, When she rade on the brown, That she was gaen to Edinburgh town, And a' to be put down. 16 ‘Why weep ye so, ye burgess-wives, Why look ye so on me? O I am going to Edinburgh town A rich wedding for to see!’ 17 When she gaed up the Tolbooth stairs, The corks frae her heels did flee; And lang or eer she cam down again She was condemnd to die. 18 When she cam to the Netherbow Port, She laughed loud laughters three; But when she cam to the gallows-foot, The tears blinded her ee. 19 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The night she'll hae but three; There was Marie Seaton, and Marie Beaton, And Marie Carmichael, and me. 20 ‘O often have I dressd my queen, And put gold upon her hair; But now I've gotten for my reward The gallows to be my share. 21 ‘Often have I dressd my queen, And often made her bed; But now I've gotten for my reward The gallows-tree to tread. 22 ‘I charge ye all, ye mariners, When ye sail ower the faem, Let neither my father nor mother get wit But that I'm coming hame! 23 ‘I charge ye all, ye mariners, That sail upon the sea, Let neither my father nor mother get wit This dog's death I'm to die! 24 ‘For if my father and mother got wit, And my bold brethren three, O mickle wad be the gude red blude This day wad be spilt for me! 25 ‘O little did my mother ken, That day she cradled me, The lands I was to travel in, Or the death I was to die!’ Marie Hamilton MARY HAMILTON—J Harris MS., fol. 10 b; “Mrs Harris and others.” 1 My mother was a proud, proud woman, A proud, proud woman and a bold; She sent me to Queen Marie's bour, When scarcely eleven years old. 2 Queen Marie's bread it was sae sweet, An her wine it was sae fine, That I hae lien in a young man's arms, An I rued it aye synsyne. 3 Queen Marie she cam doon the stair, Wi the goud kamis in her hair: ‘Oh whare, oh whare is the wee wee babe I heard greetin sae sair?’ 4 ‘It's no a babe, a babie fair, Nor ever intends to be; But I mysel, wi a sair colic, Was seek an like to dee.’ 5 They socht the bed baith up an doon, Frae the pillow to the straw, An there they got the wee wee babe, But its life was far awa. 6 ‘Come doon, come doon, Marie Hamilton, Come doon an speak to me; 7 ‘You'll no put on your dowie black, Nor yet your dowie broun; But you'll put on your ried, ried silk, To shine through Edinborough toun.’ 8 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The nicht she'll hae but three; There was Marie Bethune, an Marie Seaton, An Marie Carmichael, an me. 9 ‘Ah, little did my mother ken, The day she cradled me, The lands that I sud travel in, An the death that I suld dee.’ 10 Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The nicht she has but three; For the bonniest Marie amang them a' Was hanged upon a tree. The Queen's Mary MARY HAMILTON—K Motherwell's MS., p. 96; from Jean Macqueen, Largs. 1 Queen Mary had four serving-maids, As braw as braw could be, But ane o them has fa'n wi bairn, And for it she maun die. 2 But whan the babie it was born, A troubled woman was she; She rowed it up in a handkerchief, And flang it in the sea. 3 Out then spoke a bonnie wee burd, And it spak sharp and keen: ‘O what did ye do wi your wee babie, Ye had in your arms yestreen?’ 4 ‘O I tyed it up in a napkin, And flang it in the sea; I bade it sink, I bade it soom, 'Twad get nae mair o me.’ 5 Out and spak King Henrie, And an angry man was he: ‘A' for the drowning o that wee babe High hanged ye shall be.’ 6 ‘I'll no put on a goun o black, Nor yet a goun o green, But I'll put on a goun o gowd, To glance in young men's een. 7 ‘O gin ye meet my father or mother, Ye may tell them frae me, 'Twas for the sake o a wee wee bairn That I came here to die. 8 ‘Yestreen four Maries made Queen Mary's bed, This nicht there'll be but three, A Mary Beaton, a Mary Seaton, A Mary Carmichael, and me. 9 ‘O what will my three brithers say, When they come hame frae see, When they see three locks o my yellow hair Hinging under a gallows-tree!’ Mary Hamilton MARY HAMILTON—L Motherwell's MS., p. 280; from the recitation of Mrs Trail of Paisley. 1 Doun and cam the queen hersell, Wi the goud links in her hair: ‘O what did you do wi the braw lad bairn That I heard greet sae sair?’ 2 ‘There was never a babe into my room, Nor ever intends to be; It was but a fit o the sair colic, That was like to gar me die.’ 3 Doun and cam the king himsell, And an angry man was he: ‘If ye had saved that braw child's life, It might hae been an honour to thee.’ 4 They socht the chamer up and doun, And in below the bed, And there they fand a braw lad-bairn Lying lapperin in his blood. 5 She rowed it up in her apron green, And threw it in the sea: ‘Een sink or swim, you braw lad bairn! Ye'll neer get mair o me.’ 6 When she gaed up the Cannogate, She gied loud lauchters three; But or she cam to the Cowgate Head The tears did blind her ee. 7 ‘Come a' ye jovial sailors, That sail upon the sea, Tell neither my father nor mother The death that I'm to die! 8 ‘Come a' ye jovial sailors, That sail upon the main, See that ye tell baith my father and mother That I'm coming sailing hame! 9 ‘My father he's the Duke of York, And my mother's a gay ladie, And I mysell a pretty fair lady, And the king fell in love with me.’ Mary Hamilton MARY HAMILTON—M Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 19. 1 Then down cam Queen Marie, Wi gold links in her hair, Saying, Marie Mild, where is the child, That I heard greet sae sair? 2 ‘There was nae child wi me, madam, There was nae child wi me; It was but me in a sair cholic, When I was like to die.’ 3 ‘I'm not deceived,’ Queen Marie said, ‘No, no, indeed not I! So Marie Mild, where is the child? For sure I heard it cry.’ 4 She turned down the blankets fine, Likewise the Holland sheet, And underneath, there strangled lay A lovely baby sweet. 5 ‘O cruel mother,’ said the queen, ‘Some fiend possessed thee; But I will hang thee for this deed, My Marie tho thou be!’ 6 When she cam to the Netherbow Port She laught loud laughters three; But when she cam to the gallows-foot, The saut tear blinded her ee. 7 ‘Yestreen the Queen had four Maries, The night she'll hae but three; There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beaton, And Marie Carmichael, and me. 8 ‘Ye mariners, ye mariners, That sail upon the sea, Let not my father or mother wit The death that I maun die! 9 ‘I was my parents’ only hope, They neer had ane but me; They little thought when I left hame, They should nae mair me see!’ The Queen's Maries MARY HAMILTON—N Murison MS., p. 33; from recitation at Old Deer, 1876. 1 The streen the queen had four Maries, This nicht she'll hae but three; There's Mary Heaton, an Mary Beaton, An Mary Michel, an me, An I mysel was Mary Mild, An flower oer a' the three. 2 Mary's middle was aye sae neat, An her clothing aye sae fine, It caused her lie in a young man's airms, An she's ruet it aye sin syne. 3 She done her doon yon garden green, To pull the deceivin tree, For to keep back that young man's bairn, But forward it would be. 4 ‘Ye winna put on the dowie black, Nor yet will ye the broon, But ye'll put on the robes o red, To shine through Edinburgh toon.’ 5 She hasna pitten on the dowie black, Nor yet has she the broon, But she's pitten on the robes o red, To shine thro Edinburgh toon. 6 When she came to the mariners' toon, The mariners they were playin, 7 ‘Ye needna play for me, mariners, Ye needna play for me; Ye never saw grace in a graceless face, For there's nane therein to be. 8 ‘Seven years an I made Queen Mary's bed, Seven years an I combed her hair, An a hansome reward noo she's gien to me, Gien me the gallows-tows to wear! 9 ‘Oh little did my mither think, The day she cradled me, What road I'd hae to travel in, Or what death I'd hae to dee!’ The Queen's Marie MARY HAMILTON—O Finlay's Scottish Ballads, I, xix, from recitation. 1 There lived a lord into the south, And he had dochters three, And the youngest o them went to the king's court, To learn some courtesie. 2 She rowd it in a wee wee clout 3 She rowd it in a wee wee clout And flang't into the faem, Saying, Sink ye soon, my bonny babe! I'll go a maiden hame. 4 ‘O woe be to you, ye ill woman, An ill death may ye die! Gin ye had spared the sweet baby's life, It might hae been an honour to thee.’ 5 She wadna put on her gowns o black, Nor yet wad she o brown, But she wad put on her gowns o gowd, To glance through Embro town. 6 ‘Come saddle not to me the black,’ she says, ‘Nor yet to me the brown, But come saddle to me the milk-white steed, That I may ride in renown.’ MARY HAMILTON—P Kinloch's MSS, VII, 95, 97. My father's the Duke of Argyll, My mither's a lady gay, And I mysel am a dainty dame, And the king desired me.

Stanzas 1, 3, 6, 8, with very slight variations, were printed by Finlay in the preface to his Scottish Ballads, 1808 (O). 1 There lived a lord into the South, An he had daughters three; The youngest o them's gaen to the king's court, To learn some courtesie. 2 She had na been in the king's court A twelvemonth an a day, When word is thro the kitchen gaen, An likewise thro the ha, That Mary Moil was gane wi child To the highest steward of a'. 3 She rowd it into a basket An flang't into the sea, Saying, Sink ye soon, my bonny babe, Ye'se neer get mair o me. 4 She rowd it into a basket An flang't into the faem, Saying, Sink ye soon, my bonny babe, I'se gang a maiden hame. 5 O whan the news cam to the king An angry man was he; He has taen the table wi his foot, An in flinders gart it flie. 6 ‘O woe be to you, ye ill woman, An ill death may ye die! Gin ye had spared the sweet baby's life, It might have been an honour to thee. 7 ‘O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Moil, O busk, an gang wi me, For agen the morn at ten o clock A rare sight ye sall see.’ 8 She wadna put on her gown o black, Nor yet wad she o brown, But she wad put on her gown o gowd, To glance thro Embro town. 9 O whan she cam to the Netherbow Port She gied loud laughters three, But whan she cam to the gallows-foot The tear blinded her ee. 10 Saying, O ye mariners, mariners, That sail upon the sea, Let not my father nor mother to wit The death that I maun die. 11 ‘For little did father or mother wit, The day they cradled me, What foreign lands I should travel in, Or what death I should die. 12 ‘Yestreen the Queen had four Maries, The night she'll hae but three; There was Mary Seton, an Mary Beaton, An Mary Carmichael, an me.’ MARY HAMILTON—T Communicated to Sir Walter Scott by Mrs Christiana Greenwood, London, 21st February and 27th May, 1806, from the recitation of her mother and her aunt, who learned the ballad above fifty years before from Kirstan Scot, then an old woman, at Longnewton, near Jedburgh: Letters at Abbotsford, I, Nos 173, 189. 1 There was a duke, and he dwelt in York, And he had daughters three; One of them was an hostler-wife, And two were gay ladies. 2 O word's gane to Queen Mary's court, As fast as it coud gee, That Mary Hamilton's born a bairn, And the baby they coud na see. 3 Then came the queen and a' her maids, Swift tripping down the stair: ‘Where is the baby, Mary, That we heard weep sae sair?’ 4 ‘O say not so, Queen Mary, Nor bear ill tales o me, For this is but a sore sickness That oft times troubles me.’ 5 They sought it up, they sought it down, They sought it below the bed, And there the[y] saw the bonny wee babe, Lying wallowing in its bluid. 6 ‘Now busk ye, busk ye, Mary Hamilton, Busk ye and gang wi me, For I maun away to Edinbro town, A rich wedding to see.’ 7 Mary wad na put on the black velvet, Nor yet wad put on the brown, But she's put on the red velvet, To shine thro Edinbro town. 8 When she came unto the town, And near the Tolbooth stair, There stood many a lady gay, Weeping for Mary fair. 9 ‘O haud yeer tongue[s], ye ladys a', And weep na mair for me! O haud yeer tongues, ye ladys a', For it's for my fault I dee. 10 ‘The king he took me on his knee And he gae three drinks to me, And a' to put the babie back, But it wad na gang back for me. 11 ‘O ye mariners, ye mariners a', That sail out-owr the sea, Let neither my father nor mother get wit What has become o me! 12 ‘Let neither my father nor mother ken, Nor my bauld brethren three, For muckle wad be the gude red bluid That wad be shed for me. 13 ‘Aft hae I laced Queen Mary's back, Aft hae I kaimed her hair, And a' the reward she's gein to me's The gallows to be my heir. 14 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Marys, The night she'l hae but three; There was Mary Seatoun, and Mary Beatoun, An Mary Carmichal, an me.’ Lament of the Queen's Marie MARY HAMILTON—U “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 92, Abbotsford. Communicated to Scott, 7th January, 1804, by Rev. George Paxton, Kilmaurs, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire (afterwards professor of divinity at Edinburgh); from the mouth of Jean Milne, his “aged mother, formerly an unwearied singer of Scotish songs.” 1 ‘My father was the Duke of York, My mother a gay ladye, And I myself a daintie dame; The queen she sent for me. 2 ‘But the queen's meat it was sae sweet, And her clothing was sae rare, It made me long for a young man's bed, And I rued it evermair.’ 3 But word is up, and word is down, Amang the ladyes a', That Marie's born a babe sin yestreen, That babe it is awa. 4 But the queen she gat wit of this, She calld for a berry-brown gown, And she's awa to Marie's bower, The bower that Marie lay in. 5 ‘Open your door, my Marie,’ she says, ‘My bonny and fair Marie; They say you have born a babe sin yestreen, That babe I fain wad see.’ 6 ‘It is not sae wi me, madam, It is not sae wi me; It is but a fit of my sair sickness, That oft times troubles me.’ 7 ‘Get up, get up, my Marie,’ she says, ‘My bonny and fair Marie, And we'll away to Edinburgh town, And try the verity.’ 8 Slowly, slowly, gat she up, And slowly pat she on, And slowly went she to that milk-steed, To ride to Edinburgh town. 9 But when they cam to Edinburgh, And in by the Towbooth stair, There was mony a virtuous ladye Letting the tears fa there. 10 ‘Why weep ye sae for me, madams? Why weep ye sae for me? For sin ye brought me to this town This death ye gar me die.’ 11 When she cam to the Netherbow Port, She gae loud laughters three; But when she cam to the gallows-foot The tear blinded her ee. 12 ‘Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The night she'll hae but three; There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beatoun, And Marie Carmichael, and me. 13 ‘My love he was a pottinger, Mony drink he gae me, And a' to put back that bonnie babe, But alas! it wad na do. 14 ‘I pat that bonny babe in a box, And set it on the sea; O sink ye, swim ye, bonny bable!

But back he wad na be. 4 So Mary's to her chamber gaen, 5 Queen Mary she came down the stair, And a' her maids afore her: ‘Oh, Mary Miles, where is the child That I have heard greet sae sore O?’ 6 ‘There is no child with me, madam, There is no child with me; It was only a bit of a cholick I took, And I thought I was gawen to dee.’ 7 So they looked up, and they looked down, And they looked beneath the bed-foot, And there they saw a bonnie boy, Lying weltering in his blood. 8 ‘Since that you have killed your own dear child, The same death you shall dee.’ 9 When Mary came afore the court, A loud laugh laughed she; But when she came to the [gallows-]fit The tear blinded her ee. 10 ‘O wha will comb Queen Mary's heed?

Ffor thou hast euer wrought by a sleight; For the worthyest prince that euer was borne, You hanged vnder a cloud by night. 2 The Queene of France a letter wrote, And sealed itt with hart and ringe, And bade him come Scottland within, And shee wold marry him and crowne him king. 3 To be a king, itt is a pleasant thing, To bee a prince vnto a peere; But you haue heard, and so haue I too, A man may well by gold to deere. 4 There was an Italyan in that place, Was as wel beloued as euer was hee; Lord David was his name, Chamberlaine vnto the queene was hee. 5 Ffor if the king had risen forth of his place, He wold haue sitt him downe in the cheare, And tho itt beseemed him not soe well, Altho the king had beene present there. 6 Some lords in Scottland waxed wonderous wroth, And quarrelld with him for the nonce; I shall you tell how itt beffell, Twelue daggers were in him all att once. 7 When this queene see the chamberlaine was slaine, For him her cheeks shee did weete, And made a vow for a twelue month and a day The king and shee wold not come in one sheete. 8 Then some of the lords of Scottland waxed wrothe, And made their vow vehementlye, ‘For death of the queenes chamberlaine The king himselfe he shall dye.’ 9 They strowed his chamber ouer with gunpowder, And layd greenë rushes in his way; Ffor the traitors thought that night The worthy king for to betray. 10 To bedd the worthy king made him bowne, To take his rest, that was his desire; He was noe sooner cast on sleepe, But his chamber was on a blasing fyer. 11 Vp he lope, and a glasse window broke, He had thirty foote for to ffall; Lord Bodwell kept a priuy wach Vnderneath his castle-wall: ‘Who haue wee heere?’ sayd Lord Bodwell; ‘Answer me, now I doe call.’ 12 ‘King Henery the Eighth my vnckle was; Some pitty show for his sweet sake! Ah, Lord Bodwell, I know thee well; Some pitty on me I pray thee take!’ 13 ‘I'le pitty thee as much,’ he sayd, ‘And as much favor I'le show to thee As thou had on the queene's chamberlaine That day thou deemedst him to dye.’ 14 Through halls and towers this king they ledd, Through castles and towers that were hye, Through an arbor into an orchard, And there hanged him in a peare tree. 15 When the gouernor of Scottland he heard tell That the worthye king he was slaine, He hath banished the queene soe bitterlye That in Scottland shee dare not remaine. 16 But shee is ffled into merry England, And Scottland to a side hath laine, And through the Queene of Englands good grace Now in England shee doth remaine. 175 THE RISING IN THE NORTH Risinge in the Northe Percy MS., p. 256; Hales and Furnivall, II, 210. 1 Listen, liuely lordings all, And all that beene this place within: If you'le giue eare vnto my songe, I will tell you how this geere did begin. 2 It was the good Erle of Westmorlande, A noble erle was callëd hee, And he wrought treason against the crowne; Alas, itt was the more pittye! 3 And soe itt was the Erle of Northumberland, Another good noble erle was hee; They tooken both vpon one part, Against the crowne they wolden bee. 4 Earle Pearcy is into his garden gone, And after walkes his awne ladye: ‘I heare a bird sing in my eare That I must either ffight or fflee.’ 5 ‘God fforbidd,’ shee sayd, ‘good my lord, That euer soe that it shalbee! But goe to London to the court, And faire ffall truth and honestye!’ 6 ‘But nay, now nay, my ladye gay, That euer it shold soe bee; My treason is knowen well enoughe; Att the court I must not bee.’ 7 ‘But goe to the court yet, good my lord, Take men enowe with thee; If any man will doe you wronge, Your warrant they may bee.’ 8 ‘But nay, now nay, my lady gay, For soe itt must not bee; If I goe to the court, ladye, Death will strike me, and I must dye.’ 9 ‘But goe to the court yett, [good] my lord, I my-selfe will ryde with thee; If any man will doe you wronge, Your borrow I shalbee.’ 10 ‘But nay, now nay, my lady gay, For soe it must not bee; For if I goe to the court, ladye, Thou must me neuer see. 11 ‘But come hither, thou litle foot-page, Come thou hither vnto mee, For thou shalt goe a message to Master Norton, In all the hast that euer may bee. 12 ‘Comend me to that gentleman; Bring him here this letter from mee, And say, I pray him earnestlye That hee will ryde in my companye.’ 13 But one while the foote-page went, Another while he rann; Vntill he came to Master Norton, The ffoot-page neuer blanne. 14 And when he came to Master Nortton, He kneeled on his knee, And tooke the letter betwixt his hands, And lett the gentleman it see. 15 And when the letter itt was reade, Affore all his companye, I-wis, if you wold know the truth, There was many a weeping eye. 16 He said, Come hither, Kester Nortton, A ffine ffellow thou seemes to bee; Some good councell, Kester Nortton, This day doe thou giue to mee. 17 ‘Marry, I'le giue you councell, ffather, If you'le take councell att me, That if you haue spoken the word, father, That backe againe you doe not flee.’ 18 ‘God a mercy! Christopher Nortton, I say, God a mercye! If I doe liue and scape with liffe, Well advanced shalt thou bee. 19 ‘But come you hither, my nine good sonnes, In mens estate I thinke you bee; How many of you, my children deare, On my part that wilbe?’ 20 But eight of them did answer soone, And spake ffull hastilye; Sayes, We wilbe on your part, ffather, Till the day that we doe dye. 21 ‘But God a mercy! my children deare, And euer I say God a mercy! And yett my blessing you shall haue, Whether-soeuer I liue or dye. 22 ‘But what sayst thou, thou Ffrancis Nortton, Mine eldest sonne and mine heyre trulye? Some good councell, Ffrancis Nortton, This day thou giue to me.’ 23 ‘But I will giue you councell, ffather, If you will take councell att mee; For if you wold take my councell, father, Against the crowne you shold not bee.’ 24 ‘But ffye vpon thee, Ffrancis Nortton! I say ffye vpon thee! When thou was younge and tender of age I made ffull much of thee.’ 25 ‘But your head is white, ffather,’ he sayes, ‘And your beard is wonderous gray; Itt were shame ffor your countrye If you shold rise and fflee away.’ 26 ‘But ffye vpon thee, thou coward Ffrancis! Thou neuer tookest that of mee! When thou was younge and tender of age I made too much of thee.’ 27 ‘But I will goe with you, father,’ quoth hee; ‘Like a naked man will I bee; He that strikes the first stroake against the crowne, An ill death may hee dye!’ 28 But then rose vpp Master Nortton, that esquier, With him a ffull great companye; And then the erles they comen downe To ryde in his companye. 29 Att Whethersbye the mustered their men, Vpon a ffull fayre day; Thirteen thousand there were seene To stand in battel ray. 30 The Erle of Westmoreland, he had in his ancyent The dunn bull in sight most hye, And three doggs with golden collers Were sett out royallye. 31 The Erle of Northumberland, he had in his ancyent The halfe moone in sight soe hye, As the Lord was crucifyed on the crosse, And set forthe pleasantlye. 32 And after them did rise good Sir George Bowes, After them a spoyle to make; The erles returned backe againe, Thought euer that knight to take. 33 This barron did take a castle then, Was made of lime and stone; The vttermost walls were ese to be woon; The erles haue woon them anon. 34 But tho they woone the vttermost walls, Quickly and anon, The innermust walles the cold not winn; The were made of a rocke of stone. 35 But newes itt came to leeue London, In all the speede that euer might bee; And word it came to our royall queene Of all the rebells in the north countrye. 36 Shee turned her grace then once about, And like a royall queene shee sware; Sayes, I will ordaine them such a breake-fast As was not in the north this thousand yeere! 37 Shee caused thirty thousand men to be made, With horsse and harneis all quicklye; And shee caused thirty thousand men to be made, To take the rebells in the north countrye. 38 They tooke with them the false Erle of Warwicke, Soe did they many another man; Vntill they came to Yorke castle, I-wis they neuer stinted nor blan. 39 ‘Spread thy ancyent, Erle of Westmoreland! The halfe-moone ffaine wold wee see!’ 40 But the halfe-moone is fled and gone, And the dun bull vanished awaye; And Ffrancis Nortton and his eight sonnes Are ffled away most cowardlye. 41 Ladds with mony are counted men, Men without mony are counted none; But hold your tounge! why say you soe?

Ffull much was there traitorye The wrought the Erle of Northumberland. 3 When they were att the supper sett, Beffore many goodly gentlemen, The ffell a fflouting and mocking both, And said to the Erle of Northumberland: 4 ‘What makes you be soe sad, my lord, And in your mind soe sorrowffullye? In the north of Scottland to-morrow there's a shooting, And thither thou'st goe, my Lord Percye. 5 ‘The buttes are sett, and the shooting is made, And there is like to be great royaltye, And I am sworne into my bill Thither to bring my Lord Pearcy.’ 6 ‘I'le giue thee my hand, Douglas,’ he sayes, ‘And be the faith in my bodye, If that thou wilt ryde to the worlds end, I'le ryde in thy companye.’ 7 And then bespake the good ladye, Marry a Douglas was her name: ‘You shall byde here, good English lord; My brother is a traiterous man. 8 ‘He is a traitor stout and stronge, As I'st tell you the veretye; For he hath tane liuerance of the Erle, And into England he will liuor thee.’ 9 ‘Now hold thy tounge, thou goodlye ladye, And let all this talking bee; Ffor all the gold that's in Loug Leuen, William wold not liuor mee. 10 ‘It wold breake truce betweene England and Scottland, And freinds againe they wold neuer bee, If he shold liuor a bani[s]ht erle, Was driuen out of his owne countrye.’ 11 ‘Hold your tounge, my lord,’ shee sayes, ‘There is much ffalsehood them amonge; When you are dead, then they are done, Soone they will part them freinds againe. 12 ‘If you will giue me any trust, my lord, I'le tell you how you best may bee; You'st lett my brother ryde his wayes, And tell those English lords, trulye, 13 ‘How that you cannot with them ryde, Because you are in an ile of the sea; Then, ere my brother come againe, To Edenborrow castle I'le carry thee. 14 ‘I'le liuor you vnto the Lord Hume, And you know a trew Scothe lord is hee, For he hath lost both land and goods In ayding of your good bodye.’ 15 ‘Marry, I am woe, woman,’ he sayes, ‘That any freind fares worse for mee; For where one saith it is a true tale, Then two will say it is a lye. 16 ‘When I was att home in my [realme], Amonge my tennants all trulye, In my time of losse, wherin my need stoode, They came to ayd me honestlye. 17 ‘Therfore I left a many a child ffatherlese, And many a widdow to looke wanne; And therfore blame nothing, ladye, But the woeffull warres which I began.’ 18 ‘If you will giue me noe trust, my lord, Nor noe credence you will give mee, And you'le come hither to my right hand, Indeed, my lorid, I'le lett you see.’ 19 Saies, I neuer loued noe witchcraft, Nor neuer dealt with treacherye, But euermore held the hye way; Alas, that may be seene by mee! 20 ‘If you will not come your selfe, my lord, You'le lett your chamberlaine goe with mee, Three words that I may to him speake, And soone he shall come againe to thee.’ 21 When Iames Swynard came that lady before, Shee let him see thorrow the weme of her ring How many there was of English lords To wayte there for his master and him. 22 ‘But who beene yonder, my good ladye, That walkes soe royallye on yonder greene?’ ‘Yonder is Lord Hunsden, Iamye,’ she saye[d], ‘Alas, hee'le doe you both tree and teene!’ 23 ‘And who beene yonder, thou gay ladye, That walkes soe royallye him beside?’ ‘Yond is Sir William Drurye, Iamy,’ shee sayd, ‘And a keene captain hee is, and tryde.’ 24 ‘How many miles is itt, thou good ladye, Betwixt yond English lord and mee?’ ‘Marry, thrise fifty mile, Iamy,’ shee sayd, ‘And euen to seale and by the sea. 25 ‘I neuer was on English ground, Nor neuer see itt with mine eye, But as my witt and wisedome serues, And as [the] booke it telleth mee. 26 ‘My mother, shee was a witch woman, And part of itt shee learned mee; Shee wold let me see out of Lough Leuen What they dyd in London cytye.’ 27 ‘But who is yonde, thou good laydye, That comes yonder with an osterne fface?’ ‘Yond's Sir Iohn Forster, Iamye,’ shee sayd; ‘Methinkes thou sholdest better know him then I.’ ‘Euen soe I doe, my goodlye ladye, And euer alas, soe woe am I!’ 28 He pulled his hatt ouer his eyes, And, Lord, he wept soe tenderlye! He is gone to his master againe, And euen to tell him the veretye. 29 ‘Now hast thou beene with Marry, Iamy,’ he sayd, ‘Euen as thy tounge will tell to mee; But if thou trust in any womans words, Thou must refraine good companye.’ 30 ‘It is noe words, my lord,’ he sayes; ‘Yonder the men shee letts me see, How many English lords there is Is wayting there for you and mee. 31 ‘Yonder I see the Lord Hunsden, And hee and you is of the third degree; A greater enemye, indeed, my Lord, In England none haue yee.’ 32 ‘And I haue beene in Lough Leven The most part of these yeeres three: Yett had I neuer noe out-rake, Nor good games that I cold see. 33 ‘And I am thus bidden to yonder shooting By William Douglas all trulye; Therfore speake neuer a word out of thy mouth That thou thinkes will hinder mee.’ 34 Then he writhe the gold ring of his ffingar And gaue itt to that ladye gay; Sayes, That was a legacye left vnto mee In Harley woods where I cold bee. 35 ‘Then ffarewell hart, and farewell hand, And ffarwell all good companye! That woman shall neuer beare a sonne Shall know soe much of your priuitye.’ 36 ‘Now hold thy tounge, ladye,’ hee sayde, ‘And make not all this dole for mee, For I may well drinke, but I'st neuer eate, Till againe in Lough Leuen I bee.’ 37 He tooke his boate att the Lough Leuen, For to sayle now ouer the sea, And he hath cast vpp a siluer wand, Saies, Fare thou well, my good ladye! The ladye looked ouer her left sholder; In a dead swoone there fell shee. 38 ‘Goe backe againe, Douglas!’ he sayd, ‘And I will goe in thy companye, For sudden sicknesse yonder lady has tane, And euer, alas, shee will but dye! 39 ‘If ought come to yonder ladye but good, Then blamed sore that I shall bee, Because a banished man I am, And driuen out of my owne countrye.’ 40 ‘Come on, come on, my lord,’ he sayes, ‘And lett all such talking bee; There's ladyes enow in Lough Leuen And for to cheere yonder gay ladye.’ 41 ‘And you will not goe your selfe, my lord, You will lett my chamberlaine go with mee; Wee shall now take our boate againe, And soone wee shall ouertake thee.’ 42 ‘Come on, come on, my lord,’ he sayes, ‘And lett now all this talking bee; Ffor my sister is craftye enoughe For to beguile thousands such as you and mee.’ 43 When they had sayled fifty myle, Now fifty mile vpon the sea, Hee had fforgotten a message that hee Shold doe in Lough Leuen trulye: Hee asked, how ffarr it was to that shooting That William Douglas promised mee. 44 ‘Now faire words makes fooles faine, And that may be seene by thy master and thee; Ffor you may happen think itt soone enoughe When-euer you that shooting see.’ 45 Iamye pulled his hatt now ouer his browe, I wott the teares fell in his eye; And he is to his master againe, And ffor to tell him the veretye. 46 ‘He sayes fayre words makes fooles faine, And that may be seene by you and mee, Ffor wee may happen thinke itt soone enoughe When-euer wee that shooting see. 47 ‘Hold vpp thy head, Iamye,’ the erle sayd, ‘And neuer lett thy hart fayle thee; He did itt but to proue thee with, And see how thow wold take with death trulye.’ 48 When they had sayled other fifty mile, Other fifty mile vpon the sea, Lord Peercy called to him, himselfe, And sayd, Douglas, what wilt thou doe with mee? 49 ‘Looke that your brydle be wight, my lord, That you may goe as a shipp att sea; Looke that your spurres be bright and sharpe, That you may pricke her while shee'le awaye.’ 50 ‘What needeth this, Douglas,’ he sayth, ‘That thou needest to ffloute mee? For I was counted a horsseman good Before that euer I mett with thee. 51 ‘A ffalse Hector hath my horsse, And euer an euill death may hee dye! And Willye Armestronge hath my spurres And all the geere belongs to mee.’ 52 When the had sayled other fifty mile, Other fifty mile vpon the sea, The landed low by Barwicke-side; A deputed lord landed Lord Pereye. 177 THE EARL OF WESTMORELAND Earle of Westmorlande Percy MS., p. 112; Hales and Furnivall, I, 292. 1 ‘How long shall fortune faile me now, And keepe me heare in deadlye dreade? How long shall I in bale abide, In misery my life to leade? 2 ‘To ffall from my rose, it was my chance; Such was the Queene of England free; I tooke a lake, and turned my backe, On Bramaball More shee caused me flye. 3 ‘One gentle Armstrong that I doe ken, Alas, with thee I dare not mocke! Thou dwellest soe far on the west border, Thy name is called the Lord Iocke.’ 4 Now hath Armstrong taken noble Nevill, And as one Martinfield did profecye; He hath taken the Lord Dakers, A lords sonne of great degree. 5 He hath taken old Master Nortton, And sonnes four in his companye; Hee hath taken another gentleman, Called Iohn of Carnabie. 6 Then bespake him Charles Nevill; To all his men, I wott, sayd hee, Sayes, I must into Scottland fare; Soe nie the borders is noe biding for me. 7 When he came to Humes Castle, And all his noble companye; The Lord Hume halched them right soone, Saying, Banished men, welcome to mee! 8 They had not beene in Humes Castle Not a month and dayes three, But the regent of Scottland and he got witt That banished men there shold be. 9 ‘I'le write a letter,’ sayd the regent then, ‘And send to Humes Castle hastilye, To see whether Lord Hume wilbe soe good To bring the banished men vnto mee. 10 ‘That lord and I haue beene att deadlye fuyde, And hee and I cold neuer agree; Writting a letter, that will not serue; The banished men must not speake with me. 11 ‘But I will send for the garrison of Barwicke, That they will come all with speede, And with them will come a noble captaine, Which is called Captain Reade.’ 12 Then the Lord Hume he got witt They wold seeke vnto Nevill, where he did lye; He tooke them out of the castle of Hume, And brought them into the castle of Camelye. 13 Then bespake him Charles Nevill, To all his men, I wott, spoke hee, Sayes, I must goe take a noble shippe, And wee'le be marriners vpon the sea. 14 I'le seeke out fortune where it doth lye; In Scottland there is noe byding for mee; Then the tooke leaue with fayre Scottland, For they are sealing vpon the sea. 15 They had not sayled vpon the sea Not one day and monthes three, But they were ware of a Noble shippe, That fiue topps bare all soe hye. 16 Then Nevill called to Martinfeeld, Sayd, Martinffeeld, come hither to mee; Some good councell, Martinfeeld, I pray thee giue it vnto mee. 17 Thou told me when I was in England fayre, Before that I did take the sea, Thou neuer sawst noe banner borne But thou wold ken it with thine eye. 18 Thou neuer saw noe man in the face, Iff thou had seene before with thine eye, [But] thou coldest haue kend thy freind by thy foe, And then haue told it vnto mee. 19 Thou neuer heard noe speeche spoken, Neither in Greeke nor Hebrewe, [But] thou coldest haue answered them in any language, And then haue told it vnto mee. 20 ‘Master, master, see you yonder faire ancyent? Yonder is the serpent and the serpents head, The mould-warpe in the middest of itt, And itt all shines with gold soe redde. 21 ‘Yonder is Duke Iohn of Austria, A noble warryour on the sea, Whose dwelling is in Ciuill land, And many men, God wot, hath hee.’ 22 Then bespake him Martinfeelde, To all his fellowes, I wot, said hee, Turne our noble shipp about, And that's a token that wee will flee. 23 ‘Thy councell is not good, Martinfeeld; Itt falleth not out fitting for mee; I rue the last time I turnd my backe; I did displease my prince and the countrye.’ 24 Then bespake him noble Nevill, To all his men, I wott, sayd hee, Sett me vp my faire Dun Bull, With gilden hornes hee beares all soe hye. 25 And I will passe yonder noble Duke, By the leaue of mild Marye; For yonder is the Duke of Austria, That trauells now vpon the sea. 26 And then bespake this noble Duke, Vnto his men then sayd hee, Yonder is sure some nobleman, Or else some youth that will not flee. 27 I will put out a pinace fayre, A harold of armes vpon the sea, And goe thy way to yonder noble shippe, And bring the masters name to mee. 28 When the herald of armes came before noble Nevill, He fell downe low vpon his knee: ‘You must tell me true what is your name, And in what countrye your dwelling may bee.’ 29 ‘That will I not doe,’ sayd noble Nevill, ‘By Mary mild, that mayden ffree, Except I first know thy masters name, And in what country his dwelling may bee.’ 30 Then bespake the herald of armes, O that he spoke soe curteouslye! Duke Iohn of Austria is my masters name, He will neuer lene it vpon the sea. 31 He hath beene in the citye of Rome, His dwelling is in Ciuillee: ‘Then wee are poore Brittons,’ the Nevill can say, ‘Where wee trauell vpon the sea. 32 ‘And Charles Nevill itt is my name, I will neuer lene it vpon the sea; When I was att home in England faire, I was the Erle of Westmoreland,’ sayd hee. 33 Then backe is gone this herald of armes Whereas this noble duke did lye; ‘Loe, yonder are poore Brittons,’ can he say, ‘Where the trauell vpon the sea. 34 ‘And Charles Nevill is their masters name, He will neuer lene it vpon the sea; When he was at home in England fayre, He was the Erle of Westmoreland, said hee.’ 35 Then bespake this noble duke, And euer he spake soe hastilye, And said, Goe backe to yonder noble-man, And bid him come and speake with me. 36 For I haue read in the Booke of Mable, There shold a Brittaine come ouer the sea, Charles Nevill with a childs voice: I pray God that it may be hee. 37 When these two nobles they didden meete, They halched eche other right curteouslye; Yett Nevill halched Iohn the sooner Because a banished man, alas! was hee. 38 ‘Call in your men,’ sayd this noble duke, ‘Faine your men that I wold see;’ ‘Euer alas!’ said noble Nevill, ‘They are but a litle small companye.’ 39 First he called in Martinfield, That Martinffeeld that cold prophecye; He call[ed] in then Lord Dakers, A lords sonne of high degree. 40 Then called he in old Master Nortton, And sonnes four in his companye; He called in one other gentleman, Called Iohn of Carnabye. 41 ‘Loe! these be all my men,’ said noble Nevill, ‘And all that's in my companye; When we were att home in England fayre, Our prince and wee cold not agree.’ 42 Then bespake this noble duke: To try your manhood on the sea, Old Master Nortton shall goe ouer into France, And his sonnes four in his companye. 43 And my lord Dakers shall goe over into Ffrance, There a captaine ffor to bee; And those two other gentlement wold goe with him, And for to fare in his companye. 44 And you your-selfe shall goe into Ciuill land, And Marttinffeild that can prophecye; ‘That will I not doe,’ sayd noble Nevill, ‘By Mary mild, that mayden free. 45 ‘For the haue knowen me in wele and woe, In neede, scar[s]nesse and pouertye; Before I'le part with the worst of them, I'le rather part with my liffe,’ sayd hee. 46 And then bespake this noble duke, And euer he spake soe curteouslye; Sayes, You shall part with none of them, There is soe much manhood in your bodye. 47 Then these two noblemen labored together, Pleasantlye vpon the sea; Their landing was in Ciuill land, In Ciuilee that ffaire citye. 48 Three nights att this dukes Nevill did lye, And serued like a nobleman was hee; Then the duke made a supplication, And sent it to the queene of Ciuilee. 49 Saying, Such a man is your citye within, I mett him pleasantlye vpon the sea; He seemes to be a noble man, And captaine to your Grace he faine wold bee. 50 Then the queene sent for [these] noble men For to come into her companye; When Nevill came before the queene, Hee kneeled downe vpon his knee. 51 Shee tooke him vp by the lilly-white hand, Said, Welcome, my lord, hither to me; You must first tell me your name, And in what countrye thy dwelling may bee. 52 He said, Charles Nevill is my name; I will neuer lene it in noe countrye; When I was att home in England fayre, I was the Erle of Westmorland trulye. 53 The queene made him captaine ouer forty thousand, Watch and ward within Ciuill land to keepe, And for to warr against the heathen soldan, And for to helpe her in her neede. 54 When the heathen soldan he gott witt, In Barbarye where he did lye, Sainge, Such a man is in yonder citye within, And a bold venturer by sea is hee, 55 Then the heathen soldan made a letter, And sent it to the queene instantlye, And all that heard this letter reade Where it was rehersed in Ciuillee. 56 Saying, Haue you any man your land within Man to man dare fight with mee? And both our lands shalbe ioyned in one, And cristened lands they both shalbe. 57 Shee said, I haue noe man my land within Man to man dare fight with thee; But euery day thou shalt haue a battell, If it be for these weekes three. 58 All beheard him Charles Nevill, In his bedd where he did lye, And when he came the queene before, He fell downe low vpon his knee. 59 ‘Grant me a boone, my noble dame, For Chrissts loue that dyed on tree; Ffor I will goe fight with yond heathen soldan, If you will bestowe the manhood on mee.’ 60 Then bespake this curteous queene, And euer shee spoke soe curteouslye: Though you be a banished man out of your realme, It is great pitye that thou shold dye. 61 Then bespake this noble duke, As hee stood hard by the queenes knee: As I haue read in the Booke of Mable, There shall a Brittone come ouer the sea, 62 And Charles Nevill shold be his name; But a childs voyce, I wott, hath hee, And if he be in Christendome; For hart and hand this man hath hee. 63 Then the queenes councell cast their heads to gether, That Nevill shold fight with the heathen soldan That dwelt in the citye of Barbarye. 64 The battell and place appointed was In a fayre greene, hard by the sea, And they shood meete att the Headless Crosse, And there to fight right manfullye. 65 Then Nevill cald for the queenes ancient, And faine that ancient he wold see; The brought him forth the broken sword, With bloodye hands therein trulye. 66 The brought him forth the headless crosse, In that ancyent it was seene; ‘O this is a token,’ sayd Martinfeeld, ‘That sore ouerthrowen this prince hath beene. 67 ‘O sett me vp my fayre Dun Bull, And trumpetts blow me farr and nee, Vntill I come within a mile of the Headlesse Crosse, That the Headlesse Crosse I may see.’ 68 Then lighted downe noble Nevill, And sayd, Marttinffeeld, come hither to me; Heere I make thee choice captain over my host Vntill againe I may thee see. 69 Then Nevill rode to the Headless Crosse, Which stands soe fayre vpon the sea; There was he ware of the heathen soldan, Both fowle and vglye for to see. 70 Then the soldan began for to call; Twise he called lowd and hye, And sayd, What is this? Some kitchin boy That comes hither to fight with mee? 71 Then bespake him Charles Nevill, But a childs voice, I wott, had hee: ‘Thou spekest soe litle of Gods might, Much more lesse I doe care for thee.’ 72 Att the first meeting that these two mett, The heathen soldan and the christen man, The broke their speares quite in sunder, And after that on foote did stand. 73 The next meeting that these two mett, The swapt together with swords soe fine; The fought together till they both swett, Of blowes that were both derf and dire. 74 They fought an houre in battell strong; The soldan marke[d] Nevill with his eye; ‘There shall neuer man me ouercome Except it be Charles Nevill,’ sayd hee. 75 Then Nevill he waxed bold, And cunning in fight, I wott, was hee; Euen att the gorgett of the soldans iacke He stroke his head of presentlye. 76 Then kneeled downe noble Nevill, And thanked God for his great grace, That he shold come soe farr into a strang[e] land, To ouercome the soldan in place. 77 Hee tooke the head vpon his sword-poynt, And carryed it amongst his host soe fayre; When the saw the soldans head, They thanked God on their knees there. 78 Seuen miles from the citye the queene him mett, With procession that was soe fayre; Shee tooke the crowne beside her heade, And wold haue crowned him king there. 79 ‘Now nay! Now nay! my noble dame, For soe, I wott, itt cannott bee; I haue a ladye in England fayre, And wedded againe I wold not bee.’ 80 The queene shee called for her penman, I wot shee called him lowd and hye, Saying, Write him downe a hundred pound a day, To keepe his men more merrylye. 81 ‘I thanke your Grace,’ sayd noble Nevill, ‘For this worthy gift you haue giuen to me; If euer your Grace doe stand in neede, Champion to your Highnesse again I'le bee.’ 178 CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON—A Cotton MS.

Syck, sike, and to-towe sike, And sike and like to die; The sikest nighte that euer I abode, God lord haue mercy on me! 2 ‘Haille, master, and wether you will, And wether ye like it best;’ ‘To the castle of Crecrynbroghe, And there we will take our reste.’ 3 ‘I knowe wher is a gay castle, Is builded of lyme and stone; Within their is a gay ladie, Her lord is riden and gone.’ 4 The ladie she lend on her castle-walle, She loked vpp and downe; There was she ware of an host of men, Come riding to the towne. 5 ‘Se yow, my meri men all, And se yow what I see? Yonder I see an host of men, I muse who they bee.’ 6 She thought he had ben her wed lord, As he comd riding home; Then was it traitur Captaine Care The lord of Ester-towne. 7 They wer no soner at supper sett, Then after said the grace, Or Captaine Care and all his men Wer lighte aboute the place. 8 ‘Gyue ouer thi howsse, thou lady gay, And I will make the a bande; To-nighte thou shall ly within my armes, To-morrowe thou shall ere my lande.’ 9 Then bespacke the eldest sonne, That was both whitt and redde: O mother dere, geue ouer your howsse, Or elles we shallbe deade. 10 ‘I will not geue ouer my hous,’ she saithe, ‘Not for feare of my lyffe; It shalbe talked throughout the land, The slaughter of a wyffe. 11 ‘Fetch me my pestilett, And charge me my gonne, That I may shott at yonder bloddy butcher, The lord of Easter-towne.’ 12 Styfly vpon her wall she stode, And lett the pellettes flee; But then she myst the blody bucher, And she slew other three. 13 ‘[I will] not geue ouer my hous,’ she saithe, ‘Netheir for lord nor lowne; Nor yet for traitour Captaine Care, The lord of Easter-towne. 14 ‘I desire of Captine Care, And all his bloddye band, That he would saue my eldest sonne, The eare of all my lande.’ 15 ‘Lap him in a shete,’ he sayth, ‘And let him downe to me, And I shall take him in my armes, His waran shall I be.’ 16 The captayne sayd unto him selfe: Wyth sped, before the rest, He cut his tonge out of his head, His hart out of his brest. 17 He lapt them in a handkerchef, And knet it of knotes three, And cast them ouer the castell-wall, At that gay ladye. 18 ‘Fye vpon the, Captayne Care, And all thy bloddy band! For thou hast slayne my eldest sonne, The ayre of all my land.’ 19 Then bespake the yongest sonne, That sat on the nurses knee, Sayth, Mother gay, geue ouer your house; It smoldereth me. 20 ‘I wold geue my gold,’ she saith, ‘And so I wolde my ffee, For a blaste of the westryn wind, To dryue the smoke from thee. 21 ‘Fy vpon the, John Hamleton, That euer I paid the hyre! For thou hast broken my castle-wall, And kyndled in the ffyre.’ 22 The lady gate to her close parler, The fire fell aboute her head; She toke vp her children thre, Seth, Babes, we are all dead. 23 Then bespake the hye steward, That is of hye degree; Saith, Ladie gay, you are in close, Wether ye fighte or flee. 24 Lord Hamleton dremd in his dream, In Caruall where he laye, His halle were all of fyre, His ladie slayne or daye. 25 ‘Busk and bowne, my mery men all, Even and go ye with me; For I dremd that my haal was on fyre, My lady slayne or day.’ 26 He buskt him and bownd hym, And like a worthi knighte; And when he saw his hall burning, His harte was no dele lighte. 27 He sett a trumpett till his mouth, He blew as it plesd his grace; Twenty score of Hamlentons Was light aboute the place. 28 ‘Had I knowne as much yesternighte As I do to-daye, Captaine Care and all his men Should not haue gone so quite. 29 ‘Fye vpon the, Captaine Care, And all thy blody bande! Thou haste slayne my lady gay, More wurth then all thy lande. 30 ‘If thou had ought eny ill will,’ he saith, ‘Thou shoulde haue taken my lyffe, And haue saved my children thre, All and my louesome wyffe.’ CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON—B Percy MS., p. 34; hales and Furnivall, I, 79. 1 ‘Ffaith, master, whither you will, Whereas you like the best; Vnto the castle of Bittons-borrow, And there to take your rest.’ 2 ‘But yonder stands a castle faire, Is made of lyme and stone; Yonder is in it a fayre lady, Her lord is ridden and gone.’ 3 The lady stood on her castle-wall, She looked vpp and downe; She was ware of an hoast of men, Came rydinge towards the towne. 4 ‘See you not, my merry men all, And see you not what I doe see? Methinks I see a hoast of men; I muse who they shold be.’ 5 She thought it had beene her louly lord, He had come ryding home; It was the traitor, Captaine Carre, The lord of Westerton-towne. 6 They had noe sooner super sett, And after said the grace, But the traitor, Captaine Carre, Was light about the place. 7 ‘Giue over thy house, thou lady gay, I will make thee a band; All night with-in mine armes thou'st lye, To-morrow be the heyre of my land.’ 8 ‘I'le not giue over my house,’ shee said, ‘Neither for ladds nor man, Nor yet for traitor Captaine Carre, Vntill my lord come home. 9 ‘But reach me my pistoll pe[c]e, And charge you well my gunne; I'le shoote at the bloody bucher, The lord of Westerton.’ 10 She stood vppon her castle-wall And let the bulletts flee, And where shee mist 11 But then bespake the litle child, That sate on the nurses knee; Saies, Mother deere, giue ore this house, For the smoake it smoothers me. 12 ‘I wold giue all my gold, my childe, Soe wold I doe all my fee, For one blast of the westerne wind To blow the smoke from thee.’ 13 But when shee saw the fier Came flaming ore her head, Shee tooke then vpp her children two, Sayes, Babes, we all beene dead! 14 But Adam then he fired the house, A sorrowfull sight to see; Now hath he burned this lady faire And eke her children three. 15 Then Captaine Carre he rode away, He staid noe longer at that tide; He thought that place it was to warme Soe neere for to abide. 16 He calld vnto his merry men all, Bidd them make hast away; ‘For we haue slaine his children three, All and his lady gay.’ 17 Worde came to louly London, To London wheras her lord lay, His castle and his hall was burned, All and his lady gay. 18 Soe hath he done his children three, More dearer vnto him Then either the siluer or the gold, That men soe faine wold win. 19 But when he looket this writing on, Lord, in is hart he was woe! Saies, I will find thee, Captaine Carre, Wether thou ryde or goe! 20 Buske yee, bowne yee, my merrymen all, With tempered swords of steele, For till I haue found out Captaine Carre, My hart it is nothing weele. 21 But when he came to Dractons-borrow, Soe long ere it was day, And ther he found him Captaine Carre; That night he ment to stay. CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON—C Communicated to Percy by Robert Lambe, Norham, October 4, 1766, being all that a servant of Lambe's could remember. 1 ‘Luk ye to yon hie castel, Yon hie castel we see; A woman's wit's sun oercum, She'll gie up her house to me.’ 2 She ca'd to her merry men a', ‘Bring me my five pistols and my lang gun;’ The first shot the fair lady shot, She shot seven of Gordon's men. 3 He turned round about his back, And sware he woud ha his desire, And if that castel was built of gowd, It should gang a' to fire. 4 Up then spak her doughter deere, She had nae mair than she: ‘Gie up your house, now, mither deere, The reek it skomfishes me.’ 5 ‘I d rather see you birnt,’ said she, ‘And doun to ashes fa, Ere I gie up my house to Adam of Gordon, And to his merry men a'. 6 ‘I've four and twenty kye Gaing upo the muir; I'd gie em for a blast of wind, The reek it blaws sae sour.’ 7 Up then spak her little young son, Sits on the nourrice knee: ‘Gie up your house, now, mither deere, The reek it skomfishes me.’ 8 ‘I've twenty four ships A sailing on the sea; I'll gie em for a blast of southern wind, To blaw the reek frae thee. 9 ‘I'd rather see you birnt,’ said she, ‘And grund as sma as flour, Eer I gie up my noble house, To be Adam of Gordon's hure.’ Edom of Gordon CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON—D Robert and Andrew Foulis, Glasgow, 1755; “as preserved in the memory of a lady.” 1 It fell about the Martinmas, When the wind blew schrile and cauld, Said Edom o Gordon to his men, We maun draw to a hald. 2 ‘And what an a hald sall we draw to, My merry men and me? We will gae to the house of the Rhodes, To see that fair lady.’ 3 She had nae sooner busket her sell, Nor putten on her gown, Till Edom o Gordon and his men Were round about the town. 4 They had nae sooner sitten down, Nor sooner said the grace, Till Edom o Gordon and his men Were closed about the place. 5 The lady ran up to her tower-head, As fast as she could drie, To see if by her fair speeches She could with him agree. 6 As soon he saw the lady fair, And hir yates all locked fast, He fell into a rage of wrath, And his heart was aghast. 7 ‘Cum down to me, ye lady fair, Cum down to me; let's see; This night ye's ly by my ain side, The morn my bride sall be.’ 8 ‘I winnae cum down, ye fals Gordon, I winnae cum down to thee; I winnae forsake my ane dear lord, That is sae far frae me.’ 9 ‘Gi up your house, ye fair lady, Gi up your house to me, Or I will burn yoursel therein, Bot and your babies three.’ 10 ‘I winnae gie up, you fals Gordon, To nae sik traitor as thee, Tho you should burn mysel therein, Bot and my babies three.’ 11 ‘Set fire to the house,’ quoth fals Gordon, ‘Sin better may nae bee; And I will burn hersel therein, Bot and her babies three.’ 12 ‘And ein wae worth ye, Jock my man!

He said, You are the first that eer I wist alive again. 21 He turned hir owr and owr again; O gin hir skin was whyte! He said, I might ha spard thy life To been some mans delyte. 22 ‘Busk and boon, my merry men all, For ill dooms I do guess; I cannae luik in that bonny face, As it lyes on the grass.’ 23 ‘Them luiks to freits, my master deir, Then freits will follow them; Let it neir be said brave Edom o Gordon Was daunted with a dame.’ 24 O then he spied hir ain deir lord, As he came owr the lee; He saw his castle in a fire, As far as he could see. 25 ‘Put on, put on, my mighty men, As fast as ye can drie! For he that's hindmost of my men Sall neir get guid o me.’ 26 And some they raid, and some they ran, Fu fast out-owr the plain, But lang, lang eer he coud get up They were a' deid and slain. 27 But mony were the mudie men Lay gasping on the grien; For o fifty men that Edom brought out There were but five ged heme. 28 And mony were the mudie men Lay gasping on the grien, And mony were the fair ladys Lay lemanless at heme. 29 And round and round the waes he went, Their ashes for to view; At last into the flames he flew, And bad the world adieu.

The laird and I hae a deadly feud, The lady fain would I see. 3 As she was up on the househead, Behold, on looking down, She saw Adam o Gordon and his men, Coming riding to the town. 4 The dinner was not well set down, Nor the grace was scarcely said, Till Adam o Gordon and his men About the walls were laid. 5 ‘It's fause now fa thee, Jock my man! Thou might a let me be; Yon man has lifted the pavement-stone, An let in the low unto me.’ 6 ‘Seven years I served thee, fair ladie, You gave me meat and fee; But now I am Adam o Gordon's man, An maun either do it or die.’ 7 ‘Come down, come down, my lady Loudoun, Come down thou unto me! I'll wrap thee on a feather-bed, Thy warrand I shall be.’ 8 ‘I'll no come down, I'll no come down, For neither laird no[r] loun; Nor yet for any bloody butcher That lives in Altringham town. 9 ‘I would give the black,’ she says, ‘And so would I the brown, If that Thomas, my only son, Could charge to me a gun.’ 10 Out then spake the lady Margaret, As she stood on the stair; The fire was at her goud garters, The lowe was at her hair. 11 ‘I would give the black,’ she says, ‘And so would I the brown, For a drink of yon water, That runs by Galston Town.’ 12 Out then spake fair Annie, She was baith jimp and sma ‘O row me in a pair o sheets, And tow me down the wa!’ 13 ‘O hold thy tongue, thou fair Annie, And let thy talkin be; For thou must stay in this fair castle, And bear thy death with me.’ 14 ‘O mother,’ spoke the lord Thomas, As he sat on the nurse's knee, ‘O mother, give up this fair castle, Or the reek will worrie me.’ 15 ‘I would rather be burnt to ashes sma, And be cast on yon sea-foam, Before I'd give up this fair castle, And my lord so far from home. 16 ‘My good lord has an army strong, He's now gone oer the sea; He bad me keep this gay castle, As long as it would keep me. 17 ‘I've four-and-twenty brave milk kye, Gangs on yon lily lee; I'd give them a' for a blast of wind, To blaw the reek from me.’ 18 O pittie on yon fair castle, That's built with stone and lime! But far mair pittie on Lady Loudoun, And all her children nine! The Burning o Loudon Castle CAPTAIN CAR, OR, EDOM O GORDON—G Motherwell's MS., p. 543, from the recitation of May Richmond, at the Old Kirk of Loudon. 1 It was in and about the Martinmas time, When the wind blew schill and cauld, That Adam o Gordon said to his men, Whare will we get a hauld? 2 ‘Do ye not see yon bonnie castell, That stands on Loudon lee? The lord and I hae a deadlie feed, And his lady fain wuld I see.’ 3 Lady Campbell was standing in the close, A preenin o her goun, Whan Adam o Gordon and his men Cam riding thro Galston toun. 4 The dinner was na weel set doun, Nor yet the grace weel said, Till Adam o Gordon and a' his men Around the wa's war laid. 5 ‘Come doun, come down, Ladie Campbell,’ he said, ‘Come doun and speak to me; I'll kep thee in a feather bed, And thy warraner I will be.’ 6 ‘I winna come doun and speak to thee, Nor to ony lord nor loun; Nor yet to thee, thou bloody butcher, The laird o Auchruglen toun.’ 7 ‘Come doun, come doun, Ladye Campbell,’ he said, ‘Cum doun and speak to me; I'll kep thee on the point o my sword, And thy warraner I will be.’ 8 ‘I winna come doun and speak to thee, Nor to ony lord or loun, Nor yet to thee, thou bludie butcher, The laird o Auchruglen toun.’ 9 ‘Syne gin ye winna come doun,’ he said, ‘A’ for to speak to me, I'll tye the bands around my waist, And fire thy death sall be.’ 10 ‘I'd leifer be burnt in ashes sma, And cuist in yon sea-faem, Or I'd gie up this bonnie castell, And my gude lord frae hame. 11 ‘For my gude lord's in the army strong, He's new gane ower the sea; He bade me keep this bonnie castell, As lang's it wuld keep me.’ 12 ‘Set fire to the house,’ said bauld Gordon, ‘Set fire to the house, my men; We'll gar Lady Campbell come for to rew As she burns in the flame.’ 13 ‘O wae be to thee, Carmichael,’ she said, ‘And an ill death may ye die! For ye hae lifted the pavement-stane, And loot up the lowe to me. 14 ‘Seven years ye war about my house, And received both meat and fee:’ ‘And now I'm Adam o Gordon's man, I maun either do or dee.’ 15 ‘Oh I wad gie the black,’ she said, ‘And I wuld gie the brown, All for ae cup o the cauld water That rins to Galstoun toun.’ 16 Syne out and spak the auld dochter, She was baith jimp and sma: ‘O row me in a pair o sheets, And fling me ower the wa!’ 17 They row't her in a pair o sheets, And flang her ower the wa, And on the point o Gordon's sword She gat a deadlie fa. 18 He turned her ower, and ower again, And oh but she looked wan! ‘I think I've killed as bonnie a face As ere the sun shined on.’ 19 He turned her ower, and ower again, And oh but she lookt white! ‘I micht hae spared this bonnie face, To hae been some man's delight!’ 20 Syne out and spak Lady Margaret, As she stood on the stair: ‘The fire is at my gowd garters, And the lowe is at my hair.’ 21 Syne out and spak fair Ladie Ann, Frae childbed whare she lay: ‘Gie up this bonnie castell, mother, And let us win away.’ 22 ‘Lye still, lye still, my fair Annie, And let your talking be; For ye maun stay in this bonnie castell And dree your death wi me.’ 23 ‘Whatever death I am to dree, I winna die my lane: I'll tak a bairn in ilka arm And the third is in my wame.’ 24 Syne out and spak her youngest son, A bonnie wee boy was he: ‘Gae doun, gae doun, mother,’ he said, ‘Or the lowe will worry me.’ 25 ‘I'd leifer be brent in ashes sma And cuist in yon sea-faem, Or I'd gie up this bonnie castell, And my guid lord frae hame. 26 ‘For my gude lord's in the army strong, He's new gane ower the sea; But gin he eer returns again, Revenged my death sall be.’ 27 Syne out and spak her waitin-maid: Receive this babe frae me, And save the saikless babie's life, And I'll neer seek mair fee. 28 ‘How can I tak the bairn?’ she said, ‘How can I tak't?’ said she, ‘For my hair was ance five quarters lang, And't is now brent to my bree.’ 29 She rowit it in a feather-bed, And flang it ower the wa, But on the point o Gordon's sword It gat a deidlie fa. 30 ‘I wuld gie Loudon's bonnie castell, And Loudon's bonnie lee, All gin my youngest son Johnnie Could charge a gun to me. 31 ‘Oh, I wuld gie the black,’ she said, ‘And sae wuld I the bay, Gin young Sir George could take a steed And quickly ride away.’ 32 Syne out and spak her auldest son, As he was gaun to die: ‘Send doun your chamber-maid, mother, She gaes wi bairn to me.’ 33 ‘Gin ye were not my eldest son, And heir o a' my land, I'd tye a sheet around thy neck, And hang thee with my hand. 34 ‘I would gie my twenty gude milk-kye, That feed on Shallow lee, A' for ae blast o the norland wind, To blaw the lowe frae me.’ 35 Oh was na it a pitie o yon bonnie castell, That was biggit wi stane and lime!

I trust to God, if it be his will, That Weardale men may never be overthrown. 6 For great troubles they've had in hand, With borderers pricking hither and thither, But the greatest fray that eer they had Was with the ‘men’ of Thirlwa'nd Williehaver. 7 They gatherd together so royally, The stoutest men and the best in gear, And he that rade not on a horse, I wat he rade on a weil-fed mear. 8 So in the morning, before they came out, So well, I wot, they broke their fast; In the [forenoon they came] unto a bye fell, Where some of them did eat their last. 9 When they had eaten aye and done, They sayd some captains here needs must be: Then they choosed forth Harry Corbyl, And ‘Symon Fell,’ and Martin Ridley. 10 Then oer the moss, where as they came, With many a brank and whew, One of them could to another say, ‘I think this day we are men enew. 11 ‘For Weardale men is a journey taen; They are so far out-oer yon fell That some of them's with the two earls, And others fast in Barnard castell. 12 ‘There we shal get gear enough, For there is nane but women at hame; The sorrowful fend that they can make Is loudly cries as they were slain.’ 13 Then in at Rookhope-head they came, And there they thought tul a had their prey, But they were spy'd coming over the Dry Rig, Soon upon Saint Nicholas' day. 14 Then in at Rookhope-head they came, They ran the forest but a mile; They gatherd together in four hours Six hundred sheep within a while. 15 And horses I trow they gat But either ane or twa, And they gat them all but ane That belanged to great Rowley. 16 That Rowley was the first man that did them spy; With that he raised a mighty cry; The cry it came down Rookhope burn, And spread through Weardale hasteyly. 17 Then word came to the bailif's house, At the East Gate, where he did dwell; He was walkd out to the Smale Burns, Which stands above the Hanging Well. 18 His wife was wae when she heard tell, So well she wist her husband wanted gear; She gard saddle him his horse in haste, And neither forgot sword, jack, nor spear. 19 The bailif got wit before his gear came That such news was in the land; He was sore troubled in his heart, That on no earth that he could stand. 20 His brother was hurt three days before, With limmer thieves that did him prick; Nineteen bloody wounds lay him upon; What ferly was't that he lay sick? 21 But yet the bailif shrinked nought, But fast after them he did hye, And so did all his neighbours near, That went to bear him company. 22 But when the bailiff was gathered, And all his company, They were numberd to never a man But forty [or] under fifty. 23 The thieves was numberd a hundred men, I wat they were not of the worst That could be choosed out of Thirlwa'nd Williehaver, 24 But all that was in Rookhope-head, And all that was i Nuketon Cleugh, Where Weardale men oertook the thieves, And there they gave them fighting eneugh. 25 So sore they made them fain to flee, As many was ‘a'’ out of hand, And, for tul have been at home again, They would have been in iron bands; 26 And for the space of long seven years, As sore they mighten a had their lives; But there was never one of them That ever thought to have seen their ‘wives.’ 27 About the time the fray began, I trow it lasted but an hour, Till many a man lay weaponless, And was sore wounded in that stour. 28 Also before that hour was done, Four of the thieves were slain, Besides all those that wounded were, And eleven prisoners there was taen. 29 George Carrick and his brother Edie, Them two, I wot, they were both slain; Harry Corbyl and Lennie Carrick Bore them company in their pain. 30 One of our Weardale men was slain, Rowland Emerson his name hight; I trust to God his soul is well, Because he ‘fought’ unto the right. 31 But thus they sayd: ‘We'll not depart While we have one; speed back again!’ And when they came amongst the dead men, There they found George Carrick slain. 32 And when they found George Carrick slain, I wot it went well near their ‘heart;’ Lord, let them never make a better end That comes to play them sicken a ‘part!’ 33 I trust to God, no more they shal, Except it be one for a great chance; For God wil punish all those With a great heavy pestilence. 34 Thir limmer thieves, they have good hearts, They nevir think to be oerthrown; Three banners against Weardale men they bare, As if the world had been all their own. 35 Thir Weardale men, they have good hearts, They are as stif as any tree; For, if they'd every one been slain, Never a foot back man would flee. 36 And such a storm amongst them fell As I think you never heard the like, For he that bears his head so high, He oft-times falls into the dyke. 37 And now I do entreat you all, As many as are present here, To pray for [the] singer of this song, For he sings to make blithe your cheer. 180 KING JAMES AND BROWN Kinge James and Browne Percy MS., p. 58; Hales and Furnivall, I, 135. 1 As I did walke my selfe alone, And by one garden greene, I heard a yonge prince make great moane, Which did turne my hart to teene. 2 ‘O Lord!’ he then said vntou me, ‘Why haue I liued soe long? For yonder comes a cruell Scott,’ Quoth hee, ‘that will doe me some ronge.’ 3 And then came traitor Douglas there, He came for to betray his king; Some they brought bills, and some they brought bowes, And some the brought other things. 4 The king was aboue in a gallery, With a heauy heart; Vnto his body was sett about With swords and speares soe sharpe. 5 ‘Be you the lordes of Scotland,’ he said, ‘That hither for councell seeke to me? Or bee yoe traitors to my crowne, My blood that you wold see?’ 6 ‘Wee are the lords of Scottland,’ they said, ‘Nothing we come to craue of thee; But wee be traitors to thy crowne, Thy blood that wee will see.’ 7 ‘O fye vpon you, you false Scotts! For you neuer all trew wilbe; My grandfather you haue slaine, And caused my mother to flee. 8 ‘My grandfather you haue slaine, And my owne father you hanged on a tree; And now,’ quoth he, ‘the like treason You haue now wrought for me. 9 ‘Ffarwell hart, and farwell hand! Farwell all pleasures alsoe! Farwell th my head 10 ‘If thou wilt And soe goe away with mee.’ 11 ‘Goe marry thy daughter to whome thou wilt,’ Quoth Browne; ‘thou marrys none to me; For I'le not be a traitor,’ quoth Browne, ‘For all the gold that euer I see.’ 12 This Douglas, hearing Browne soe say, Began to flee away full fast; ‘But tarry a while,’ saies lusty Browne, ‘I'le make you to pay before you passe.’ 13 He hath taken the Douglas prisoner, And hath brought him before the king; He kneeled low vpon his knee, For pardon there prainge. 14 ‘How shold I pardon thee,’ saith the king, ‘And thou'le remaine a traitor still? For euer since that I was borne,’ Quoth he, ‘thou hast sought my blood to spill.’ 15 ‘For if you will grant me my pardon,’ he said, ‘Out of this place soe free, I wilbe sworne before your Grace A trew subiect to bee.’ 16 ‘God for-gaue his death,’ said the king, ‘When he was nayled vpon a tree; And as free as euer God forgaue his death, Douglas,’ quoth he, ‘I'le forgiue thee. 17 ‘And all the traitors in Scottland,’ Quoth he, ‘both great and small; As free as euer God forgaue his death, Soe free I will forgiue them all.’ 18 ‘I thanke you for your pardon, king, That you haue granted forth soe plaine; If I liue a twelue month to an end, You shall not aliue remaine. 19 ‘Tomorrow yet, or ere I dine, I meane to doo thee one good turne; For Edenborrow, that is thine owne,’ Quoth he, ‘I will both h[arry] and [burne].’ 20 Thus Douglas hied towards Edenborrow, And many of his men were gone beffore, And after him on euery side, With him there went some twenty score. 21 But when that they did see him come, They cryed lowd with voices, saying, ‘Yonder comes a false traitor, That wold haue slaine our king.’ 22 They chaynd vp the gates of Edenborrow, And there the made them wonderous fast, And there Browne sett on Douglas againe, And quicklye did him ouer cast. 23 But worde came backe againe to the king, With all the speed that euer might bee, That traitor Douglas there was taken, And his body was there to see. 24 ‘Bring me his taker,’ quoth the king, ‘Come, quickly bring him vnto me! I'le giue a thousand pound a yeere, What man soeuer he bee.’ 25 But then they called lusty Browne; Sayes, ‘Browne, come thou hither to mee. How oft hast thou foughten for my sake, And alwayes woone the victory?’ 26 ‘The first time that I fought for you, It was in Edenborrow, king; If there I had not stoutly stood, My leege, you neuer had beene king. 27 ‘The second time I fought for you, Here I will tell you in this place; I killd the sheriffs sonne of Carlile,’ Quoth he, ‘that wold haue slaine your Grace. 28 ‘The third time that I fought for you, Here for to let you vnderstand, I slew the Bishopp of S? Andrew[s],’ Quoth he, ‘with a possat in [his hand].’ 29 quoth hee, ‘That euer my manhood I did trye; I'le make a vow for Englands sake That I will neuer battell flee.’ 30 ‘God amercy, Browne,’ then said the king, ‘And God amercy heartilye! Before I made thee but a knight, But now an earle I will make thee. 31 ‘God saue the queene of England,’ he said, ‘For her blood is verry neshe; As neere vnto her I am As a colloppe shorne from the fleshe. 32 ‘If I be false to England,’ he said, ‘Either in earnest or in iest, I might be likened to a bird,’ Quoth he, ‘that did defile it nest.’ 181 THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY The Bonny Earl of Murray THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY—A Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany, 1763, p. 356. 1 Ye Highlands, and ye Lawlands, Oh where have you been?

Hast thou playd me that?’ quo he; ‘The morn the Justice Court's to stand, And Logie's place ye maun supply.’ 14 Carmichal's awa to May Margr[e]t's bower, Een as fast as he may dree: ‘It's if Young Logie be within, Tell him to come speak to me.’ 15 May Margret's turnd her round about, A wait a loud laughter gae she: ‘The egg is cheeped and the bird is flown, And seek ye the laird of Young Logie.’ 16 The one is sheppd at the pier o Leith, The other at the Queen's Ferry, And she has gotten a father to her bairn, The wanton laird of Young [Logie]. The young Laird of Ochiltrie THE LAIRD O LOGIE—B Herd, The Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 240. 1 O listen, gude peopell, to my tale, Listen to what I tel to thee; The king has taiken a poor prisoner, The wanton laird of Ochiltrie. 2 When news came to our guidly queen, Sche sicht, and said right mournfullie, ‘O what will cum of Lady Margret! Wha beirs sick luve to Ochiltrie.’ 3 Lady Margret tore hir yellow hair When as the queen tald hir the saim: ‘I wis that I had neir bin born, Nor neir had knawn Ochiltrie's naim!’ 4 ‘Fie, na!’ quoth the queen, ‘that maunna be; Fie, na! that maunna be; I'll fynd ye out a better way To saif the lyfe of Ochiltrie.’ 5 The queen sche trippit up the stair, And lowlie knielt upon hir knie: ‘The first boon which I cum to craive Is the life of gentel Ochiltrie.’ 6 ‘O iff you had askd me castels or towirs, I wad hae gin thaim, twa or thrie; Bot a' the monie in fair Scotland Winna buy the lyfe of Ochiltrie.’ 7 The queen sche trippit down the stair, And down she gade richt mournfullie: ‘It's a' the monie in fair Scotland Winna buy the lyfe of Ochiltrie!’ 8 Lady Margaret tore her yellow hair When as the queen tald hir the saim: ‘I'll tak a knife and end my lyfe, And be in the grave as soon as him!’ 9 ‘Ah, na! Fie, na!’ quoth the queen, ‘Fie, na! Fie, na! this maunna be; I'll set ye on a better way To loose and set Ochiltrie frie.’ 10 The queen sche slippit up the stair, And sche gaid up richt privatlie, And sche has stoun the prison-keys, And gane and set Ochiltrie frie. 11 And sche's gien him a purse of gowd, And another of whyt monie; Sche's gien him twa pistoles by's syde, Saying to him, Shute, when ye win frie. 12 And when he cam to the queen's window, Whaten a joyfou shute gae he! ‘Peace be to our royal queen, And peace be in hir companie!’ 13 ‘O whaten a voyce is that?’ quoth the king, ‘Whaten a voyce is that?’ quoth he; ‘Whaten a voyce is that?’ quoth the king; ‘I think it's the voyce of Ochiltrie. 14 ‘Call to me a' my gaolours, Call thaim by thirtie and by thrie; Whairfoir the morn, at twelve a clock, It's hangit schall they ilk ane be.’ 15 ‘O didna ye send your keyis to us?

The Laird of Logie THE LAIRD O LOGIE—C A stall-copy, printed by M. Randall, Stirling. 1 The young laird of Logie is to prison cast; Carmichael's the keeper of the key; Lady Margaret, the queen's cousin, is very sick, And it's all for love of Young Logie. 2 She's into the queen's chamber gone, She has kneeld low down on her knee; Says she, You must go to the king yourself; It's all for a pardon to Young Logie. 3 The queen is unto the king's chamber gone, She has kneeld low down on her knee: ‘O what is the matter, my gracious queen? And what means all this courtesie? 4 ‘Have I not made thee queen of fair Scotland? The queen of England I trow thou be; Have not I made thee my wedded wife? Then what needs all this courtesie?’ 5 ‘You have made me queen of [fair] Scotland, The queen of England I surely be; Since you have made me your wedded wife, Will you grant a pardon for Young Logie?’ 6 The king he turned him right round about, I think an angry man was he: ‘The morrow, before it is twelve o'clock, O hangd shall the laird of Logie be.’ 7 The queen she's into her chamber gone, Amongst her maries, so frank and free; ‘You may weep, you may weep, Margaret,’ she says, ‘For hanged must the laird of Logie be.’ 8 She has torn her silken scarf and hood, And so has she her yellow hair: ‘Now fare you well, both king and queen, And adieu to Scotland for ever mair!’ 9 She has put off her goun of silk, And so has she her gay clothing: ‘Go fetch me a knife, and I'll kill myself, Since the laird of Logie is not mine.’ 10 Then out bespoke our gracious queen, And she spoke words most tenderlie; ‘Now hold your hand, Lady Margaret,’ she said, ‘And I'll try to set Young Logie free.’ 11 She's up into the king's chamber gone, And among his nobles so free; ‘Hold away, hold away!’ says our gracious king, ‘No more of your pardons for Young Logie. 12 ‘Had you but askd me for houses and land, I would have given you castles three; Or anything else shall be at your command, But only a pardon for Young Logie.’ 13 ‘Hold your hand now, my sovereign liege, And of your anger let it be; For the innocent blood of Lady Margret It will rest on the head of thee and me.’ 14 The king and queen are gone to their bed, But as he was sleeping so quietly, She has stole the keys from below his head, And has sent to set Young Logie free. 15 Young Logie he's on horseback got, Of chains and fetters he's got free; As he passd by the king's window, There he has fired vollies three. 16 The king he awakend out of his sleep, Out of his bed came hastilie; Says, I'll lay all my lands and rents That yonder's the laird of Logie free.’ 17 The king has sent to the prison strong, He has calld for his keepers three; Says, How does all your prisoners? And how does the young laird of Logie? 18 ‘Your Majesty sent me your wedding-ring, With your high command to set him free;’ ‘Then tomorrow, before that I eat or drink, I surely will hang you keepers three.’ 19 Then out bespoke our gracious queen, And she spoke words most tenderlie; ‘If ever you begin to hang a man for this, Your Majesty must begin with me.’ 20 The one took shipping at [the pier of] Leith, The other at the Queen's Ferrie; Lady Margaret has gotten the man she loves, I mean the young laird of Logie. Young Logie, THE LAIRD O LOGIE—D Harris MS., fol. 16; from Mrs Harris's recitation. 1 Pretty is the story I hae to tell, Pretty is the praisin o itsel, An pretty is the prisner oor king's tane, The rantin young laird o Logie. 2 Has he brunt? or has he slain? Or has he done any injurie? Oh no, no, he's done nothing at all, But stown a kiss frae the queen's marie. 3 Ladie Margaret cam doon the stair, Wringin her hands an tearin her hair; Cryin, Oh, that ever I to Scotland cam, Aye to see Young Logie dee! 4 ‘Had your tongue noo, Lady Margaret, An a' your weepin lat a bee! For I'll gae to the king my sell, An plead for life to Young Logie.’ 5 ‘First whan I to Scotland cam, You promised to gie me askens three; The first then o these askens is Life for the young laird o Logie.’ 6 ‘If you had asked house or lands, They suld hae been at your command; But the morn, ere I taste meat or drink, High hanged sall Young Logie be.’ 7 Lady Margaret cam doon the stair, Wringin her hands an tearin her hair; Cryin, Oh, that ever I to Scotland cam, A' to see Young Logie dee! 8 ‘Hand your tongue noo, Lady Margaret, An a' your weepin lat a bee! For I'll counterfiet the king's hand-write, An steal frae him his richt hand gloe, An send them to Pitcairn's wa's, A' to lat Young Logie free.’ 9 She counterfieted the king's hand-write, An stole frae him his richt hand gloe, An sent them to Pitcairn's wa's, A' to let Young Logie free. 10 The king luikit owre his castle-wa, Was luikin to see what he cald see: ‘My life to wad an my land to pawn, Yonder comes the young laird o Logie!’ 11 ‘Pardon, oh pardon! my lord the king, Aye I pray you pardon me; For I counterfieted your hand-write, An stole frae you your richt hand gloe, An sent them to Pitcairn's wa's, A' to set Young Logie free.’ 12 ‘If this had been done by laird or lord, Or by baron of high degree, I'se mak it sure, upon my word, His life suld hae gane for Young Logie. 13 ‘But since it is my gracious queen, A hearty pardon we will gie, An for her sake we'll free the loon, The rantin young laird o Logie.’ The Laird o Logie; or, May Margaret THE LAIRD O LOGIE—E Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 56, the third stanza; from recitation.

Fa la la didle 2 Then Johnë Armstrang to Willie can say, Billie, a rideing then will we; England and us has been long at a feed; Perhaps we may hitt of some bootie. 3 Then they'r comd on to Hutton Hall, They rade that proper place about; But the laird he was the wiser man, For he had left nae gear without. 4 Then he had left nae gear to steal, Except six sheep upon a lee; Says Johnie, I'de rather in England die Before their six sheep good to Liddisdale with me. 5 ‘But how cald they the man we last with mett, Billie, as we came over the know?’ ‘That same he is an innocent fool, And some men calls him Dick o the Cow.’ 6 ‘That fool has three as good kyne of his own As is in a' Cumberland, billie,’ quoth he: ‘Betide my life, betide my death, These three kyne shal go to Liddisdaile with me.’ 7 Then they're comd on to the poor fool's house, And they have broken his wals so wide; They have loosd out Dick o the Cow's kyne three, And tane three coerlets off his wife's bed. 8 Then on the morn, when the day grew light, The shouts and crys rose loud and high: ‘Hold thy tongue, my wife,’ he says, ‘And of thy crying let me bee. 9 ‘Hald thy tongue, my wife,’ he says, ‘And of thy crying let me bee, And ay that where thou wants a kow, Good sooth that I shal bring the three.’ 10 Then Dick's comd on to lord and master, And I wate a drerie fool [was] he: ‘Hald thy tongue, my fool,’ he says, ‘For I may not stand to jest with thee.’ 11 ‘Shame speed a your jesting, my lord,’ quo Dickie, ‘For nae such jesting grees with me; Liddesdaile has been in my house this last night, And they have tane my three kyne from me. 12 ‘But I may nae langer in Cumberland dwel, To be your poor fool and your leel, Unless ye give me leave, my lord, To go to Liddisdale and steal.’ 13 ‘To give thee leave, my fool,’ he says, ‘Thou speaks against mine honour and me; Unless thou give me thy trouth and thy right hand Thou'l steal frae nane but them that sta from thee.’ 14 ‘There is my trouth and my right hand; My head shal hing on Hairibie, I'le never crose Carlele sands again, If I steal frae a man but them that sta frae me.’ 15 Dickie has tane leave at lord and master, And I wate a merrie fool was he; He has bought a bridle and a pair of new spurs, And has packed them up in his breek-thigh. 16 Then Dickie's come on for Puddinburn, Even as fast as he may drie; Dickie's come on for Puddinburn, Where there was thirty Armstrongs and three. 17 ‘What's this comd on me!’ quo Dickë, ‘What meakle wae's this happend on me,’ quo he, ‘Where here is but ae innocent fool, And there is thirty Armstrongs and three!’ 18 Yet he's comd up to the hall among them all; So wel he became his courtisie: ‘Well may ye be, my good Laird's Jock! But the deil bless all your companie. 19 ‘I'm come to plain of your man Fair Johnie Armstrong, And syne his billie Willie,’ quo he; ‘How they have been in my house this last night, And they have tane my three ky frae me.’ 20 Quo Johnie Armstrong, We'll him hang; ‘Nay,’ thain quo Willie, ‘we'll him slae;’ But up bespake another young man, We'le nit him in a four-nooked sheet, Give him his burden of batts, and lett him gae. 21 Then up bespake the good Laird's Jock, The best falla in the companie: Fitt thy way down a little while, Dickë, And a peice of thine own cow's hough I'l give to thee. 22 But Dicki's heart it grew so great That never a bitt of it he dought to eat; But Dickie was warr of ane auld peat-house, Where there al the night he thought for to sleep. 23 Then Dickie was warr of that auld peat-house, Where there al the night he thought for to ly; And a' the prayers the poor fool prayd was, ‘I wish I had a mense for my own three kye!’ 24 Then it was the use of Puddinburn, And the house of Mangertoun, all haile! These that came not at the first call They gott no more meat till the next meall. 25 The lads, that hungry and aevery was, Above the door-head they flang the key; Dickie took good notice to that; Says, There's a bootie younder for me. 26 Then Dickie's gane into the stable, Where there stood thirty horse and three; He has ty'd them a' with St Mary knot, All these horse but barely three. 27 He has ty'd them a' with St Mary knott, All these horse but barely three; He has loupen on one, taken another in his hand, And out at the door and gane is Dickie. 28 Then on the morn, when the day grew light, The shouts and cryes rose loud and high; ‘What's that theife?’ quo the good Laird's Jock; ‘Tel me the truth and the verity. 29 ‘What's that theife?’ quo the good Laird's Jock; ‘See unto me ye do not lie:’ ‘Dick o the Cow has been in the stable this last night, And has my brother's horse and mine frae me.’ 30 ‘Ye wad never be teld it,’ quo the Laird's Jock; ‘Have ye not found my tales fu leel? Ye wade never out of England bide, Till crooked and blind and a' wad steal.’ 31 ‘But will thou lend me thy bay?’ Fair Johnë Armstrong can say, ‘There's nae mae horse loose in the stable but he; And I'le either bring ye Dick o the Kow again, Or the day is come that he must die.’ 32 ‘To lend thee my bay,’ the Laird's Jock can say, ‘He's both worth gold and good monie; Dick o the Kow has away twa horse, I wish no thou should no make him three.’ 33 He has tane the Laird's jack on his back, The twa-handed sword that hang lieugh by his thigh; He has tane the steel cap on his head, And on is he to follow Dickie. 34 Then Dickie was not a mile off the town, I wate a mile but barely three, Till John Armstrang has oertane Dick o the Kow, Hand for hand on Cannobei lee. 35 ‘Abide th[e], bide now, Dickie than, The day is come that thow must die;’ Dickie looked oer his left shoulder; ‘Johnie, has thow any mo in thy company? 36 ‘There is a preacher in owr chapell, And a' the lee-lang day teaches he; When day is gane, and night is come, There's never a word I mark but three. 37 ‘The first and second's Faith and Conscience; The third is, Johnie, Take head of thee; But what faith and conscience had thow, traitor, When thou took my three kye frae me? 38 ‘And when thou had tane my three kye, Thou thought in thy heart thou was no wel sped; But thou sent thi billie Willie oer the know, And he took three coerlets of my wife's bed.’ 39 Then Johne lett a spear fa leaugh by his thigh, Thought well to run the innocent through; But the powers above was more than his, He ran but the poor fool's jerkin through. 40 Together they ran or ever they blan — This was Dickie, the fool, and hee — Dickie could not win to him with the blade of the sword, But he feld [him] with the plummet under the eye. 41 Now Dickie has [feld] Fair Johnë Armstrong, The prettiest man in the south countrey; ‘Gramercie,’ then can Dickie say, ‘I had twa horse, thou has made me three.’ 42 He has tane the laird's jack off his back, The twa-handed sword that hang leiugh by his thigh; He has tane the steel cape off his head: ‘Johnie, I'le tel my master I met with thee.’ 43 When Johnë wakend out of his dream, I wate a dreiry man was he: ‘Is thou gane now, Dickie, than? The shame gae in thy company! 44 ‘Is thou gane now, Dickie, than? The shame go in thy companie! For if I should live this hundred year, I shal never fight with a fool after thee.’ 45 Then Dickie comed home to lord and master, Even as fast as he may driee: ‘Now Dickie, I shal neither eat meat nor drink Till high hanged that thou shall be!’ 46 ‘The shame speed the liars, my lord!’ quo Dickie, ‘That was no the promise ye made to me; For I'd never gane to Liddesdale to steal Till that I sought my leave at thee.’ 47 ‘But what gart thow steal the Laird's-Jock's horse? And, limmer, what gart thou steal him?’ quo he; ‘For lang might thow in Cumberland dwelt Or the Laird's Jock had stoln ought frae thee.’ 48 ‘Indeed I wate ye leed, my lord, And even so loud as I hear ye lie; I wan him frae his man, Fair Johnë Armstrong, Hand for hand on Cannobie lee. 49 ‘There's the jack was on his back, The twa-handed sword that hung lewgh by his thigh; There's the steel cap was on his head; I have a' these takens to lett you see.’ 50 ‘If that be true thou to me tels — I trow thou dare not tel a lie — I'le give thee twenty pound for the good horse, Wel teld in thy cloke-lap shall be. 51 ‘And I'le give thee one of my best milkkye, To maintain thy wife and children three; [And that may be as good, I think, As ony twa o thine might be.’] 52 ‘The shame speed the liars, my lord!’ quo Dicke, ‘Trow ye ay to make a fool of me? I'le either have thirty pound for the good horse, Or els he's gae to Mattan fair wi me:’ 53 Then he has given him thirty pound for the good horse, All in gold and good monie; He has given him one of his best milk-kye, To maintain his wife and children three. 54 Then Dickie's come down through Carlile town, Even as fast as he may drie: The first of men that he with mett Was my lord's brother, Bailife Glazenberrie. 55 ‘Well may ye be, my good Ralph Scrupe!’ ‘Welcome, my brother's fool!’ quo he; ‘Where did thou gett Fair Johnie Armstrong's horse?’ ‘Where did I get him but steall him,’ quo he. 56 ‘But will thou sell me Fair Johnie Armstrong['s] horse? And, billie, will thou sel him to me?’ quo he: ‘Ay, and tel me the monie on my cloke-lap, For there's not one fathing I'le trust thee.’ 57 ‘I'le give thee fifteen pound for the good horse, Wel teld on thy cloke-lap shal be; And I'le give [thee] one of my best milk-kye, To maintain thy wife and thy children three.’ 58 ‘The shame speed the liars, my lord!’ quo Dickë, ‘Trow ye ay to make a fool of me?’ quo he: ‘I'le either have thirty pound for the good horse, Or else he's to Mattan Fair with me.’ 59 He has given him thirty pound for the good horse, All in gold and good monie; He has given him one of his best milk-kye, To maintain his wife and children three. 60 Then Dickie lap a loup on high, And I wate a loud laughter leugh he: ‘I wish the neck of the third horse were browken, For I have a better of my own, and onie better can be.’ 61 Then Dickie comd hame to his wife again; Judge ye how the poor fool he sped; He has given her three score of English pounds For the three auld coerlets was tane of her bed. 62 ‘Hae, take thee there twa as good kye, I trow, as al thy three might be; And yet here is a white-footed naigg; I think he'le carry booth thee and me. 63 ‘But I may no langer in Cumberland dwell; The Armstrongs the'le hang me high:’ But Dickie has tane leave at lord and master, And Burgh under Stanemuir there dwels Dickie. 186 KINMONT WILLIE KINMONT WILLIE Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, I, 111, 1802; II, 32, 1833. 1 O have ye na heard o the fause Sakelde? O have ye na heard o the keen Lord Scroop? How they hae taen bauld Kinmont Willie, On Hairibee to hang him up? 2 Had Willie had but twenty men, But twenty men as stout as he, Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont taen, Wi eight score in his companie. 3 They band his legs beneath the steed, They tied his hands behind his back; They guarded him, fivesome on each side, And they brought him ower the Liddelrack. 4 They led him thro the Liddel-rack, And also thro the Carlisle sands; They brought him to Carlisle castell, To be at my Lord Scroope's commands. 5 ‘My hands are tied, but my tongue is free, And whae will dare this deed avow? Or answer by the border law? Or answer to the bauld Buccleuch?’ 6 ‘Now haud thy tongue, thou rank reiver! There's never a Scot shall set ye free; Before ye cross my castle-yate, I trow ye shall take farewell o me.’ 7 ‘Fear na ye that, my lord,’ quo Willie; ‘By the faith o my bodie, Lord Scroop,’ he said, ‘I never yet lodged in a hostelrie But I paid my lawing before I gaed.’ 8 Now word is gane to the bauld Keeper, In Branksome Ha where that he lay, That Lord Scroope has taen the Kinmont Willie, Between the hours of night and day. 9 He has taen the table wi his hand, He garrd the red wine spring on hie; ‘Now Christ's curse on my head,’ he said, ‘But avenged of Lord Scroop I'll be! 10 ‘O is my basnet a widow's curch? Or my lance a wand of the willow-tree? Or my arm a ladye's lilye hand? That an English lord should lightly me. 11 ‘And have they taen him Kinmont Willie, Against the truce of Border tide, And forgotten that the bauld Bacleuch Is keeper here on the Scottish side? 12 ‘And have they een taen him Kinmont Willie, Withouten either dread or fear, And forgotten that the bauld Bacleuch Can back a steed, or shake a spear? 13 ‘O were there war between the lands, As well I wot that there is none, I would slight Carlisle castell high, Tho it were builded of marble-stone. 14 ‘I would set that castell in a low, And sloken it with English blood; There's nevir a man in Cumberland Should ken where Carlisle castell stood. 15 ‘But since nae war's between the lands, And there is peace, and peace should be, I'll neither harm English lad or lass, And yet the Kinmont freed shall be!’ 16 He has calld him forty marchmen bauld, I trow they were of his ain name, Except Sir Gilbert Elliot, calld The Laird of Stobs, I mean the same. 17 He has calld him forty marchmen bauld, Were kinsmen to the bauld Buccleuch, With spur on heel, and splent on spauld, And gleuves of green, and feathers blue. 18 There were five and five before them a', Wi hunting-horns and bugles bright; And five and five came wi Buccleuch, Like Warden's men, arrayed for fight. 19 And five and five like a mason-gang, That carried the ladders lang and hie; And five and five like broken men; And so they reached the Woodhouselee. 20 And as we crossd the Bateable Land, When to the English side we held, The first o men that we met wi, Whae sould it be but fause Sakelde! 21 ‘Where be ye gaun, ye hunters keen?’ Quo fause Sakelde; ‘come tell to me!’ ‘We go to hunt an English stag, Has trespassd on the Scots countrie.’ 22 ‘Where be ye gaun, ye marshal-men?’ Quo fause Sakelde; ‘come tell me true!’ ‘We go to catch a rank reiver, Has broken faith wi the bauld Buccleuch.’ 23 ‘Where are ye gaun, ye mason-lads, Wi a' your ladders lang and hie?’ ‘We gang to herry a corbie's nest, That wons not far frae Woodhouselee.’ 24 ‘Where be ye gaun, ye broken men?’ Quo fause Sakelde; ‘come tell to me!’ Now Dickie of Dryhope led that band, And the nevir a word o lear had he. 25 ‘Why trespass ye on the English side? Row-footed outlaws, stand!’ quo he; The neer a word had Dickie to say, Sae he thrust the lance thro his fause bodie. 26 Then on we held for Carlisle toun, And at Staneshaw-bank the Eden we crossd; The water was great, and meikle of spait, But the nevir a horse nor man we lost. 27 And when we reachd the Staneshaw-bank, The wind was rising loud and hie; And there the laird garrd leave our steeds, For fear that they should stamp and nie. 28 And when we left the Staneshaw-bank, The wind began full loud to blaw; But't was wind and weet, and fire and sleet, When we came beneath the castel-wa. 29 We crept on knees, and held our breath, Till we placed the ladders against the wa; And sae ready was Buccleuch himsell To mount the first before us a'. 30 He has taen the watchman by the throat, He flung him down upon the lead: ‘Had there not been peace between our lands, Upon the other side thou hadst gaed. 31 ‘Now sound out, trumpets!’ quo Buccleuch; ‘Let's waken Lord Scroope right merrilie!’ Then loud the Warden's trumpets blew ‘O whae dare meddle wi me?’ 32 Then speedilie to wark we gaed, And raised the slogan ane and a', And cut a hole thro a sheet of lead, And so we wan to the castel-ha. 33 They thought King James and a' his men Had won the house wi bow and speir; It was but twenty Scots and ten That put a thousand in sic a stear! 34 Wi coulters and wi forehammers, We garrd the bars bang merrilie, Untill we came to the inner prison, Where Willie o Kinmont he did lie. 35 And when we cam to the lower prison, Where Willie o Kinmont he did lie, ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, Kinmont Willie, Upon the morn that thou's to die?’ 36 ‘O I sleep saft, and I wake aft, It's lang since sleeping was fleyd frae me; Gie my service back to my wyfe and bairns, And a' gude fellows that speer for me.’ 37 Then Red Rowan has hente him up, The starkest men in Teviotdale: ‘Abide, abide now, Red Rowan, Till of my Lord Scroope I take farewell. 38 ‘Farewell, farewell, my gude Lord Scroope! My gude Lord Scroope, farewell!’ he cried; ‘I'll pay you for my lodging-maill When first we meet on the border-side.’ 39 Then shoulder high, with shout and cry, We bore him down the ladder lang; At every stride Red Rowan made, I wot the Kinmont's airns playd clang. 40 ‘O mony a time,’ quo Kinmont Willie, ‘I have ridden horse baith wild and wood; But a rougher beast than Red Rowan I ween my legs have neer bestrode. 41 ‘And mony a time,’ quo Kinmont Willie, ‘I've pricked a horse out oure the furs; But since the day I backed a steed I nevir wore sic cumbrous spurs.’ 42 We scarce had won the Staneshaw-bank, When a' the Carlisle bells were rung, And a thousand men, in horse and foot, Cam wi the keen Lord Scroope along. 43 Buccleuch has turned to Eden Water, Even where it flowd frae bank to brim, And he has plunged in wi a' his band, And safely swam them thro the stream. 44 He turned him on the other side, And at Lord Scroope his glove flung he: ‘If ye like na my visit in merry England, In fair Scotland come visit me!’ 45 All sore astonished stood Lord Scroope, He stood as still as rock of stane; He scarcely dared to trew his eyes When thro the water they had gane. 46 ‘He is either himsell a devil frae hell, Or else his mother a witch maun be; I wad na have ridden that wan water For a' the gowd in Christentie.’ 187 JOCK O THE SIDE John a Side JOCK O THE SIDE—A Percy MS., p. 254; Hales and Furnivall, II, 203. 1 Peeter a Whifeild he hath slaine, And Iohn a Side, he is tane, And Iohn is bound both hand and foote, And to the New-castle he is gone. 2 But tydinges came to the Sybill o the Side, By the water-side as shee rann; Shee tooke her kirtle by the hem, And fast shee runn to Mangerton. 3 The lord was sett downe at his meate; When these tydings shee did him tell, Neuer a morsell might he eate. 4 But lords, the wrunge their fingars white, Ladyes did pull themselues by the haire, Crying, Alas and weladay! For Iohn o the Side wee shall neuer see more. 5 ‘But wee'le goe sell our droues of kine, And after them our oxen sell, And after them our troopes of sheepe, But wee will loose him out of the New Castell.’ 6 But then bespake him Hobby Noble, And spoke these words wonderous hye; Sayes, Giue me fiue men to my selfe, And I'le feitch Iohn o the Side to thee. 7 ‘Yea, thou'st haue fiue, Hobby Noble, Of the best that are in this countrye; I'le giue thee fiue thousand, Hobby Noble, That walke in Tyuidale trulye.’ 8 ‘Nay, I'le haue but fiue,’ saies Hobby Noble, ‘That shall walke away with mee; Wee will ryde like noe men of warr; But like poore badgers wee wilbe.’ 9 They stuffet vp all their baggs with straw, And their steeds barefoot must bee; ‘Come on, my bretheren,’ sayes Hobby Noble, ‘Come on your wayes, and goe with mee.’ 10 And when they came to Culerton ford, The water was vp, they cold it not goe; And then they were ware of a good old man, How his boy and hee were at the plowe. 11 ‘But stand you still,’ sayes Hobby Noble, ‘Stand you still heere at this shore, And I will ryde to yonder old man, And see w[h]ere the gate it lyes ore. 12 ‘But Christ you saue, father!’ quoth hee, ‘Crist both you saue and see! Where is the way ouer this fford? For Christ's sake tell itt mee!’ 13 ‘But I haue dwelled heere three score yeere, Soe haue I done three score and three; I neuer sawe man nor horsse goe ore, Except itt were a horse of tree.’ 14 ‘But fare thou well, thou good old man! The devill in hell I leave with thee, Noe better comfort heere this night Thow giues my bretheren heere and me.’ 15 But when he came to his brether againe, And told this tydings full of woe, And then they found a well good gate They might ryde ore by two and two. 16 And when they were come ouer the fforde, All safe gotten att the last, ‘Thankes be to God!’ sayes Hobby Nobble, ‘The worst of our perill is past.’ 17 And then they came into Howbrame wood, And there then they found a tree, And cutt itt downe then by the roote; The lenght was thirty ffoote and three. 18 And four of them did take the planke, As light as it had beene a fflee, And carryed itt to the New Castle, Where as Iohn a Side did lye. 19 And some did climbe vp by the walls, And some did climbe vp by the tree, Vntill they came vpp to the top of the castle, Where Iohn made his moane trulye. 20 He sayd, God be with thee, Sybill o the Side! My owne mother thou art, quoth hee; If thou knew this night I were here, A woe woman then woldest thou bee. 21 And fare you well, Lord Mangerton! And euer I say God be with thee! For if you knew this night I were heere, You wold sell your land for to loose mee. 22 And fare thou well, Much, Millers sonne! Much, Millars sonne, I say; Thou has beene better att merke midnight Then euer thou was att noone o the day. 23 And fare thou well, my good Lord Clough! Thou art thy ffathers sonne and heire; Thou neuer saw him in all thy liffe But with him durst thou breake a speare. 24 ‘Wee are brothers childer nine or ten, And sisters children ten or eleven. We neuer came to the feild to fight, But the worst of us was counted a man.’ 25 But then bespake him Hoby Noble, And spake these words vnto him; Saies, Sleepest thou, wakest thou, Iohn o the Side, Or art thou this castle within? 26 ‘But who is there,’ quoth Iohn oth Side, ‘That knowes my name soe right and free?’ ‘I am a bastard-brother of thine; This night I am comen for to loose thee.’ 27 ‘Now nay, now nay,’ quoth Iohn o the Side; ‘Itt ffeares me sore that will not bee; Ffor a pecke of gold and silver,’ Iohn sayd, ‘In faith this night will not loose mee.’ 28 But then bespake him Hobby Noble, And till his brother thus sayd hee; Sayes, Four shall take this matter in hand, And two shall tent our geldings ffree. 29 Four did breake one dore without, Then Iohn brake fiue himsell; But when they came to the iron dore, It smote twelue vpon the bell. 30 ‘Itt ffeares me sore,’ sayd Much, the Miller, ‘That heere taken wee all shalbee;’ ‘But goe away, bretheren,’ sayd Iohn a Side, ‘For euer alas! this will not bee.’ 31 ‘But ffye vpon thee!’ sayd Hobby Noble; ‘Much, the Miller, fye vpon thee! ‘It sore feares me,’ said Hobby Noble, ‘Man that thou wilt neuer bee. 32 But then he had Fflanders files two or three, And hee fyled downe that iron dore, And tooke Iohn out of the New Castle, And sayd, Looke thou neuer come heere more! 33 When he had him fforth of the New Castle, ‘Away with me, Iohn, thou shalt ryde:’ But euer alas! itt cold not bee; For Iohn cold neither sitt nor stryde. 34 But then he had sheets two or three, And bound Iohns boults fast to his ffeete, And sett him on a well good steede, Himselfe on another by him seete. 35 Then Hobby Noble smiled and loug[h]e, And spoke these worde in mickle pryde: Thou sitts soe finely on thy geldinge That, Iohn, thou rydes like a bryde. 36 And when they came thorrow Howbrame towne, Iohns horsse there stumbled at a stone; ‘Out and alas!’ cryed Much, the Miller, ‘Iohn, thou'le make vs all be tane.’ 37 ‘But fye vpon thee!’ saies Hobby Noble, ‘Much, the Millar, fye on thee! I know full well,’ sayes Hobby Noble, ‘Man that thou wilt neuer bee.’ 38 And when the came into Howbrame wood, He had Fflanders files two or three To file Iohns bolts beside his ffeete, That hee might ryde more easilye. 39 Sayes, ‘Iohn, now leape ouer a steede!’ And Iohn then hee lope ouer fiue: ‘I know well,’ sayes Hobby Noble, ‘Iohn, thy ffellow is not aliue.’ 40 Then he brought him home to Mangerton; The lord then he was att his meate; But when Iohn o the Side he there did see, For faine hee cold noe more eate. 41 He sayes, Blest be thou, Hobby Noble, That euer thou wast man borne! Thou hast feitched vs home good Iohn oth Side, That was now cleane ffrom vs gone. Jock o the Side JOCK O THE SIDE—B a. Caw's Poetical Museum, 1784, p. 145; “from an old manuscript copy.” b. Campbell's Albyn's Anthology, II, 28; “taken down from the recitation of Mr Thomas Shortreed,” of Jedburgh, “who learnt it from his father.” 1 ‘Now Liddisdale has ridden a raid, But I wat they had better staid at hame; For Mitchel o Winfield he is dead, And my son Johnie is prisner tane.’ With my fa ding diddle, la la dow diddle. 2 For Mangerton House auld Downie is gane; Her coats she has kilted up to her knee, And down the water wi speed she rins, While tears in spaits fa fast frae her eie. 3 Then up and bespake the lord Mangerton: ‘What news, what news, sister Downie, to me?’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my lord Mangerton; Mitchel is killd, and tane they hae my son Johnie.’ 4 ‘Neer fear, sister Downie,’ quo Mangerton; ‘I hae yokes of oxen four and twentie, My barns, my byres, and my faulds, a' weel filld, And I'll part wi them a' ere Johnie shall die. 5 ‘Three men I'll take to set him free, Weel harnessd a' wi best o steel; The English rogues may hear, and drie The weight o their braid swords to feel. 6 ‘The Laird's Jock ane, the Laird's Wat twa, Oh, Hobie Noble, thou ane maun be; Thy coat is blue, thou has been true, Since England banishd thee, to me.’ 7 Now Hobie was an English man, In Bewcastle-dale was bred and born; But his misdeeds they were sae great, They banishd him neer to return. 8 Lord Mangerton them orders gave, ‘Your horses the wrang way maun a' be shod; Like gentlemen ye must not seem, But look like corn-caugers gawn ae road. 9 ‘Your armour gude ye maunna shaw, Nor ance appear like men o weir; As country lads be all arrayd, Wi branks and brecham on ilk mare.’ 10 Sae now a' their horses are shod the wrang way, And Hobie has mounted his grey sae fine, Jock his lively bay, Wat's on his white horse behind, And on they rode for the water o Tyne. 11 At the Choler-ford they a' light down, And there, wi the help o the light o the moon, A tree they cut, wi fifteen naggs upo ilk side, To climb up the wa o Newcastle town. 12 But when they cam to Newcastle town, And were alighted at the wa, They fand their three three ells oer laigh, They fand their stick baith short and sma. 13 Then up and spake the Laird's ain Jock, ‘There's naething for't, the gates we maun force;’ But when they cam the gates unto, A proud porter withstood baith men and horse. 14 His neck in twa I wat they hae wrung, Wi hand or foot he neer playd paw; His life and his keys at anes they hae tane, And cast his body ahind the wa. 15 Now soon they reach Newcastle jail, And to the prisner thus they call: ‘Sleips thou, wakes thou, Jock o the Side? Or is thou wearied o thy thrall?’ 16 Jock answers thus, wi dolefu tone: Aft, aft I wake, I seldom sleip; But wha's this kens my name sae weel, And thus to hear my waes do[es] seik? 17 Then up and spake the good Laird's Jock, ‘Neer fear ye now, my billie,’ quo he; ‘For here's the Laird's Jock, the Laird's Wat, And Hobie Noble, come to set thee free.’ 18 ‘Oh, had thy tongue, and speak nae mair, And o thy tawk now let me be! For if a' Liddisdale were here the night, The morn's the day that I maun die. 19 ‘Full fifteen stane o Spanish iron They hae laid a' right sair on me; Wi locks and keys I am fast bound Into this dungeon mirk and drearie.’ 20 ‘Fear ye no that,’ quo the Laird's Jock; ‘A faint heart neer wan a fair ladie; Work thou within, we'll work without, And I'll be bound we set thee free.’ 21 The first strong dore that they came at, They loosed it without a key; The next chaind dore that they cam at, They gard it a' in flinders flee. 22 The prisner now, upo his back, The Laird's Jock's gotten up fu hie; And down the stair him, irons and a', Wi nae sma speed and joy brings he. 23 ‘Now, Jock, I wat,’ quo Hobie Noble, ‘Part o the weight ye may lay on me;’ ‘I wat weel no,’ quo the Laird's Jock, ‘I count him lighter than a flee.’ 24 Sae out at the gates they a' are gane, The prisner's set on horseback hie; And now wi speed they've tane the gate, While ilk ane jokes fu wantonlie. 25 ‘O Jock, sae winsomely's ye ride, Wi baith your feet upo ae side! Sae weel's ye're harnessd, and sae trig! In troth ye sit like ony bride.’ 26 The night, tho wat, they didna mind, But hied them on fu mirrilie, Until they cam to Cholerford brae, Where the water ran like mountains hie. 27 But when they came to Cholerford, There they met with an auld man; Says, Honest man, will the water ride? Tell us in haste, if that ye can. 28 ‘I wat weel no,’ quo the good auld man; ‘Here I hae livd this threty yeirs and three, And I neer yet saw the Tyne sae big, Nor rinning ance sae like a sea.’ 29 Then up and spake the Laird's saft Wat, The greatest coward in the company; ‘Now halt, now halt, we needna try't; The day is comd we a' maun die!’ 30 ‘Poor faint-hearted thief!’ quo the Laird's Jock, ‘There'll nae man die but he that's fie; I'll lead ye a' right safely through; Lift ye the prisner on ahint me.’ 31 Sae now the water they a' hae tane, By anes and twas they a' swam through; ‘Here are we a' safe,’ says the Laird's Jock, ‘And, poor faint Wat, what think ye now?’ 32 They scarce the ither side had won, When twenty men they saw pursue; Frae Newcastle town they had been sent, A' English lads, right good and true. 33 But when the land-sergeant the water saw, ‘It winna ride, my lads,’ quo he; Then out he cries, Ye the prisner may take, But leave the irons, I pray, to me. 34 ‘I wat weel no,’ cryd the Laird's Jock, ‘I'll keep them a', shoon to my mare they'll be; My good grey mare, for I am sure, She's bought them a' fu dear frae thee.’ 35 Sae now they're away for Liddisdale, Een as fast as they coud them hie; The prisner's brought to his ain fire-side, And there o's airns they make him free. 36 ‘Now, Jock, my billie,’ quo a' the three, ‘The day was comd thou was to die; But thou's as weel at thy ain fire-side, Now sitting, I think, tween thee and me.’ 37 They hae gard fill up ae punch-bowl, And after it they maun hae anither, And thus the night they a' hae spent, Just as they had been brither and brither.

O sleeps thou, wakes thou, dear billy?’ ‘Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I wake; But who's that knows my name so well?’ [said he.] ‘I am thy brother Dicky,’ he says; ‘This night I'm come to borrow thee.’ 19 But up bespake the prisoner then, And O but he spake woefully! ‘Today has been a justice-court, And a' Liddesdale were here the night, The morn's the day at I'se to die.’ 20 ‘What is thy crime, Archie, my billy? What is the crime they lay to thee?’ ‘I brake a spear i the warden's breast, For saving my master's land,’ said he. 21 ‘If that be a' the crime they lay to thee, Archie, my billy, If that be the crime they lay to thee, Work thou within, and me without, And thro good strength I'll borrow thee.’ 22 ‘I cannot work, billy,’ he says, ‘I cannot work, billy, with thee, For fifteen stone of Spanish iron Lyes fast to me with lock and key.’ 23 When Dicky he heard that, ‘Away, thou crabby chiel!’ cried he; He's taen the door aye with his foot, And fast he followd it with his knee. Till a' the bolts the door hung on, O th' prison-floor he made them flee. 24 ‘Thou's welcome, welcome, Archy, my billy, Thou's aye right dear welcome to me; There shall be straiks this day,’ he said, ‘This day or thou be taen from me.’ 25 He's got the prisoner on o his back, He's gotten him irons and aw, 26 Up bespake then Jocky Ha, ‘Let some o th' prisoner lean on me;’ ‘The diel o there,’ quo Dicky than, ‘He's no the wightdom of a flea.’ 27 They are on o that gray mare, And they are on o her aw three, And they linked the irons about her neck, And galloped the street right wantonly. 28 ‘To horse, to horse,’ then, ‘all,’ he says, ‘Horse ye with all the might ye may, For the jailor he will waken next; And the prisoners had a' wan away.’ 29 There was horsing, horsing of haste, And cracking o whips out oer the lea, Until they came to the Bonshaw Shield; There they held their council privately. 30 Some says, ‘We'll gang the Annan road; It is the better road,’ said they; But up bespak than Dicky Ha, The wisest of that company: 31 ‘Annan road's a publick road, It's not the road that makes for me; But we will through at Annan Holme, It is the better road,’ said he; ‘An we were in at Wamfrey Gate, The Johnstones they will a' help me.’ 32 But Dicky lookd oer his left shoulder, I wait a wiley look gave he; He spied the leiutenant coming, And a hundre men of his company. 33 ‘So horse ye, horse ye, lads!’ he said, ‘O horse ye, sure and siccerly! For yonder is the lieutenant, With a hundred men of his company.’ 34 There was horsing, horsing of haste, And cracking o whips out oer the lea, Until they came to Annan Holme, And it was running like a sea. 35 But up bespake the lieutenant, Until a bonny lad said he, ‘Who is the man,’ said the leiutenant, ‘Rides foremost of yon company?’ 36 Then up bespake the bonny lad, Until the lieutenant said he, ‘Some men do ca him Dicky Ha, Rides foremost of yon company.’ 37 ‘O haste ye, haste ye!’ said the leiutenant, ‘Pursue with a' the might ye may! For the man had needs to be well saint That comes thro the hands o Dicky Ha.’ 38 But up bespak Jock the laird, ‘This has been a dearsome night to me; I've a colt of four years old, I wait he wannelld like the wind; If ever he come to the deep, He will plump down, leave me behind.’ 39 ‘Wae light o thee and thy horse baith, Jock, And even so thy horse and thee! Take thou mine, and I'll take thine, Foul fa the warst horse i th' company! I'll cast the prisoner me behind; There'll no man die but him that's fee.’ 40 There they've a' taen the flood, And they have taen it hastily; Dicky was the hindmost took the flood, And foremost on the land stood he. 41 Dicky's turnd his horse about, And he has turnd it hastilly: ‘Come through, come thro, my lieutenant, Come thro this day, and drink wi me, And thy dinner's be dressd in Annan Holme, It sall not cost thee one penny.’ 42 ‘I think some witch has bore the, Dicky, Or some devil in hell been thy daddy; I woud not swum that wan water double-horsed, For a' the gold in Christenty. 43 ‘But throw me thro my irons, Dicky, I wait they cost me full dear;’ ‘O devil be there,’ quo Jocky Hall, ‘They'l be good shoon to my gray mare.’ 44 O up bespoke then Jock the laird, ‘This has been a dearsome night to me; For yesternight the Cawfield was my ain, Landsman again I neer sall be.’ 45 ‘Now wae light o thee and thy lands baith, Jock, And even so baith the land and thee! For gear will come and gear will gang, But three brothers again we never were to be.’ Archie of Cafield; or, Archie of Ca'field ARCHIE O CAWFIELD—B a.

There was three brethren of us born, And one of us is condemnd to die.’ 3 ‘O chuse ye out a hundred men, A hundred men in Christ[e]ndie, And we'll away to Dumfries town, And set our billie Archie free.’ 4 ‘A hundred men you cannot get, Nor yet sixteen in Christendie; For some of them will us betray, And other some will work for fee. 5 ‘But chuse ye out eleven men, And we ourselves thirteen will be, And we'ill away to Dumfries town, And borrow bony billie Archie.’ 6 There was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching upon the lee, Untill they came to the Murraywhat, And they lighted a' right speedylie. 7 ‘A smith, a smith!’ Dickie he crys, ‘A smith, a smith, right speedily, To turn back the cakers of our horses feet! For it is forward we woud be.’ 8 There was a horsing, horsing in haste, There was marching on the lee, Untill they came to Dumfries port, And there they lighted right manfulie. 9 ‘There['s] six of us will hold the horse, And other five watchmen will be; But who is the man among you a' Will go to the Tolbooth door wi me?’ 10 O up then spake Jokie Hall (Fra the laigh of Tiviotdale was he), ‘If it should cost my life this very night, I'll ga to the Tollbooth door wi thee.’ 11 ‘O sleepst thou, wakest thow, Archie laddie? O sleepst thou, wakest thow, dear billie?’ ‘I sleep but saft, I waken oft, For the morn's the day that I man die.’ 12 ‘Be o good cheer now, Archie lad, Be o good cheer now, dear billie; Work thow within and I without, And the morn thou's dine at Cafield wi me.’ 13 ‘O work, O work, Archie?’ he cries, ‘O work, O work? ther's na working for me; For ther's fifteen stane o Spanish iron, And it lys fow sair on my body.’ 14 O Jokie Hall stept to the door, And he bended it back upon his knee, And he made the bolts that the door hang on Jump to the wa right wantonlie. 15 He took the prisoner on his back, And down the Tollbooth stairs came he; Out then spak Dickie and said, Let some o the weight fa on me; ‘O shame a ma!’ co Jokie Ha, ‘For he's no the weight of a poor flee.’ 16 The gray mare stands at the door, And I wat neer a foot stirt she, Till they laid the links out oer her neck, And her girth was the gold-twist to be. 17 And they came down thro Dumfries town, And O but they came bonily! Untill they came to Lochmaben port, And they leugh a' the night manfulie. 18 There was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching on the lee, Untill they came to the Murraywhat, And they lighted a' right speedilie. 19 ‘A smith, a smith!’ Dickie he cries, ‘A smith, a smith, right speedilie, To file off the shakles fra my dear brother! For it is forward we wad be.’ 20 They had not filtt a shakle of iron, A shakle of iron but barely three, Till out then spake young Simon brave, ‘Ye do na see what I do see. 21 ‘Lo yonder comes Liewtenant Gordon, And a hundred men in his company:’ ‘O wo is me!’ then Archie cries, ‘For I'm the prisoner, and I must die.’ 22 O there was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching upon the lee, Untill they came to Annan side, And it was flowing like the sea. 23 ‘I have a colt, and he's four years old, And he can amble like the wind, But when he comes to the belly deep, He lays himself down on the ground.’ 24 ‘But I have a mare, and they call her Meg, And she's the best in Christendie; Set ye the prisoner me behind; Ther'll na man die but he that's fae!’ 25 Now they did swim that wan water, And O but they swam bonilie! Untill they came to the other side, And they wrang their cloathes right drunk[i]lie. 26 ‘Come through, come through, Lieutenant Gordon! Come through, and drink some wine wi me! For ther's a ale-house neer hard by, And it shall not cost thee one penny.’ 27 ‘Throw me my irons, Dickie!’ he cries, ‘For I wat they cost me right dear;’ ‘O shame a ma!’ cries Jokie Ha, ‘For they'll be good shoon to my gray mare.’ 28 ‘Surely thy minnie has been some witch, Or thy dad some warlock has been; Else thow had never attempted such, Or to the bottom thow had gone. 29 ‘Throw me my irons, Dickie!’ he cries, ‘For I wot they cost me dear enough;’ ‘O shame a ma!’ cries Jokie Ha, ‘They'll be good shakles to my plough.’ 30 ‘Come through, come through, Liewtenant Gordon! Come throw, and drink some wine wi me!

We hae a brother condemned to death, And the very morn must hanged be. 3 Then out it speaks him Little Dick, I wat a gude fellow was he: ‘Had I three men unto mysell, Well borrowed shoud Bell Archie be.’ 4 Out it speaks him Johnny Ha, A better fellow by far was he: ‘Ye shall hae six men and yoursell, And me to bear you companie. 5 ‘Twa for keepers o the guard, See that to keep it sickerlie, And twa to come, and twa to gang, And twa to speak wi Bell Archie. 6 ‘But we winna gang like men o weir, Nor yet will we like cavalliers; But we will gang like corn-buyers, And we'll put brechens on our mares.’ 7 Then they are to the jail-house doors, And they hae tirled at the pin: ‘Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Bell Archie? Quickly rise, lat us come in.’ 8 ‘I sleep not aft, I lie not saft; Wha's there that knocks and kens my name?’ ‘It is your brothers Dick and John; Ye'll open the door, lat us come in.’ 9 ‘Awa, awa, my brethren dear, And ye'll had far awa frae me; If ye be found at jail-house door, I fear like dogs they'll gar ye die.’ 10 ‘Ohon, alas! my brother dear, Is this the hearkning ye gie to me? If ye'll work therein as we thereout, Well borrowd shoud your body be.’ 11 ‘How can I work therein, therein, Or yet how can I work thereout, When fifty tons o Spanish iron Are my fair body round about?’ 12 He put his fingers to the lock, I wat he handled them sickerlie, And doors of deal, and bands of steel, He gart them all in flinders flee. 13 He's taen the prisoner in his arms, And he has kissd him cheek and chin: ‘Now since we've met, my brother dear, There shall be dunts ere we twa twine.’ 14 He's taen the prisoner on his back, And a' his heavy irons tee, But and his marie in his hand, And straight to Annan gate went he. 15 But when they came to Annan water, It was roaring like the sea: ‘O stay a little, Johnny Ha, Here we can neither fecht nor flee. 16 ‘O a refreshment we maun hae, We are baith dry and hungry tee; We'll gang to Robert's at the mill, It stands upon yon lily lee.’ 17 Up in the morning the jailor raise, As soon's 'twas light that he coud see; Wi a pint o wine and a mess sae fine, Into the prison-house went he. 18 When he came to the prison-door, A dreary sight he had to see; The locks were shot, the doors were broke, And a' the prisoners won free. 19 ‘Ye'll gae and waken Annan town, Raise up five hundred men and three; And if these rascals may be found, I vow like dogs I'll gar them die. 20 ‘O dinna ye hear proud Annan roar, Mair loud than ever roard the sea? We'll get the rascals on this side, Sure they can neither fecht nor flee. 21 ‘Some gar ride, and some gar rin, Wi a' the haste that ye can make; We'll get them in some tavern-house, For Annan water they winna take.’ 22 As Little Dick was looking round, All for to see what he could see, Saw the proud sheriff trip the plain, Five hundred men his companie. 23 ‘O fare ye well, my bonny wife, Likewise farewell, my children three! Fare ye well, ye lands o Cafield! For you again I neer will see. 24 ‘For well I kent, ere I came here, That Annan water woud ruin me; My horse is young, he'll nae lat ride, And in this water I maun die.’ 25 Out it speaks him Johnny Ha, I wat a gude fellow was he: ‘O plague upo your cowardly face! The bluntest man I eer did see. 26 ‘Gie me your horse, take ye my mare, The devil drown my mare and thee! Gie me the prisoner on behind, And nane will die but he that's fay.’ 27 He quickly lap upo the horse, And strait the stirrups siccarlie, And jumpd upo the other side, Wi the prisoner and his irons tee. 28 The sheriff then came to the bank, And heard its roaring like the sea; Says, How these men they hae got ower, It is a marvel unto me. 29 ‘I wadna venture after them, For a' the criminals that I see; Nevertheless now, Johnny Ha, Throw ower the fetters unto me.’ 30 ‘Deil part you and the fetters,’ he said, ‘As lang as my mare needs a shee; If she gang barefoot ere they be done, I wish an ill death mat ye die.’ 31 ‘Awa, awa, now Johnny Ha, Your talk to me seems very snell; Your mither's been some wild rank witch, And you yoursell an imp o hell.’ Billie Archie ARCHIE O CAWFIELD—D Motherwell's MS., p. 467, “received in MS. by Buchan from Mr Nicol, of Strichen, who wrote as he had learned early in life from old people:” Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 335. 1 ‘Seven years have I loved my love, And seven years my love's loved me, But now to-morrow is the day That billy Archie, my love, must die.’ 2 O then out spoke him Little Dickie, And still the best fellow was he: ‘Had I but five men and my self, Then we would borrow billy Archie.’ 3 Out it spoke him Caff o Lin, And still the worst fellow was he: ‘You shall have five men and yourself, And I will bear you companye.’ 4 ‘We will not go like to dragoons, Nor yet will we like grenadiers, But we will go like corn-dealers, And lay our brechams on our meares. 5 ‘And twa of us will watch the road, And other twa will go between, And I will go to jail-house door, And hold the prisoner unthought lang.’ 6 ‘Who is this at jail-house door, So well as they do know the gin?’ ‘It's I myself,’ [said] him Little Dickie, ‘And oh sae fain's I would be in!’ 7 ‘Away, away, now, Little Dickie! Away, let all your folly be! If the Lord Lieutenant come on you, Like unto dogs he'll cause you die.’ 8 ‘Hold you, hold you, billy Archie, And now let all your folly be! Tho I die without, you'll not die within, For borrowed shall your body be.’ 9 ‘Away, away, now, Little Dickie! Away, let all this folly be! An hundred pounds of Spanish irons Is all bound on my fair bodie.’ 10 Wi plough-culters and gavellocks They made the jail-house door to flee; ‘And in God's name,’ said Little Dickie, ‘Cast you the prisoner behind me!’ 11 They had not rode a great way off, With all the haste that ever could be, Till they espied the Lord Lieutenant, With a hundred men in's companie. 12 But when they came to wan water, It now was rumbling like the sea; Then were they got into a strait, As great a strait as well could be. 13 Then out did speak him Caff o Lin, And aye the warst fellow was he: ‘Now God be with my wife and bairns! For fatherless my babes will be. 14 ‘My horse is young, he cannot swim; The water's deep, and will not wade; My children must be fatherless, My wife a widow, whateer betide.’ 15 O then cried out him Little Dickie, And still the best fellow was he: ‘Take you my mare, I'll take your horse, And Devil drown my mare and thee!’ 16 Now they have taken the wan water, Tho it was roaring like the sea, And whan they got to the other side, I wot they bragged right crouselie. 17 ‘Come thro, come thro now, Lord Lieutenant! O do come thro, I pray of thee! There is an alehouse not far off, We'll dine you and your companye.’ 18 ‘Away, away, now, Little Dickie! O now let all your taunting be! There's not a man in the king's army That would have tried what's done by thee. 19 ‘Cast back, cast back my fetters again! Cast back my fetters! I say to thee; And get you gane the way you came, I wish no prisoners like to thee.’ 20 ‘I have a mare, she's called Meg, The best in all our low countrie; If she gang barefoot till they are done, An ill death may your lordship die!’ ARCHIE O CAWFIELD—E Macmath MS, p. 76. “Taken down by me, September, 1886, from my aunt, Miss Jane Webster: heard by her in her youth, at Airds.” 1 ‘We'll awa to bonnie Dundee, And set our brither Archie free.’ 2 They broke through locks, and they broke through bars, And they broke through everything that cam in their way, Until they cam to a big iron gate, And that's where brother Archie lay. [Little John says] 3 ‘O brither Archie speak to me, For we are come to set ye free.’ 4 ‘Such a thing it canna be, For there's fifty pund o gude Spanish airn Atween my neckbane and my knee.’ ARCHIE O CAWFIELD—F Communicated by Mr J. M. Watson, of Clark's Island, Plymouth Harbor, Massachusetts, April 10, 1889, as remembered by him from the singing of his father. 1 As I walked out one morning in May, Just before the break of day, I heard two brothers a making their moan, And I listened a while to what they did say. I heard, etc. 2 ‘We have a brother in prison,’ said they, ‘Oh in prison lieth he! If we had but ten men just like ourselves, The prisoner we would soon set free.’ 3 ‘Oh no, no, no!’ Bold Dickie said he, ‘Oh no, no, no, that never can be! For forty men is full little enough And I for to ride in their companie. 4 ‘Ten to hold the horses in, Ten to guard the city about, Ten for to stand at the prison-door, And ten to fetch poor Archer out.’ 5 They mounted their horses, and so rode they, Who but they so merrilie! They rode till they came to a broad river's side, And there they alighted so manfullie. 6 They mounted their horses, and so swam they, Who but they so merrilie! They swam till they came to the other side, And there they alighted so manfullie. 7 They mounted their horses, and so rode they, Who but they so merrilie! They rode till they came to that prison-door, And then they alighted so manfullie. 8 ‘For I have forty men in my companie, And I have come to set you free.’ 9 ‘Oh no, no, no!’ poor Archer says he, ‘Oh no, no, no, that never can be! For I have forty pounds of good Spanish iron Betwixt my ankle and my knee.’ 10 Bold Dickie broke lock, Bold Dickie broke key, Bold Dickie broke everything that he could see; He took poor Archer under one arm, And carried him out so manfullie. 11 They mounted their horses, and so rode they, Who but they so merrilie! They rode till they came to that broad river's side, And there they alighted so manfullie. 12 ‘Bold Dickie, Bold Dickie,’ poor Archer says he, ‘Take my love home to my wife and children three; For my horse grows lame, he cannot swim, And here I see that I must die.’ 13 They shifted their horses, and so swam they, Who but they so merrilie! They swam till they came to the other side, And there they alighted so manfullie. 14 ‘Bold Dickie, Bold Dickie,’ poor Archer says he, ‘Look you yonder there and see; For the high-sheriff he is a coming, With an hundred men in his companie.’ 15 ‘Bold Dickie, Bold Dickie,’ High-sheriff said he, ‘You're the damndest rascal that ever I see! Go bring me back the iron you've stole, And I will set the prisoner frec.’ 16 ‘Oh no, no, no!’ Bold Dickie said he, ‘Oh no, no, no, that never can be! For the iron't will do to shoe the horses, The blacksmith rides in our companie.’ 17 ‘Bold Dickie, Bold Dickie,’ High-sheriff says he, ‘You're the damndest rascal that ever I see!’ ‘I thank ye for nothing,’ Bold Dickie says he, ‘And you're a damned fool for following me.’</field>

That Liddisdale may safely say, For in it there was baith meat and drink, And corn unto our geldings gay. Fala la diddle, etc. 2 We were stout-hearted men and true, As England it did often say; But now we may turn our backs and fly, Since brave Noble is seld away. 3 Now Hobie he was an English man, And born into Bewcastle dale, But his misdeeds they were sae great, They banishd him to Liddisdale. 4 At Kershope-foot the tryst was set, Kershope of the lily lee; And there was traitour Sim o the Mains, With him a private companie. 5 Then Hobie has graithd his body weel, I wat it was wi baith good iron and steel; And he has pulld out his fringed grey, And there, brave Noble, he rade him weel. 6 Then Hobie is down the water gane, Een as fast as he may drie; Tho they shoud a' brusten and broken their hearts, Frae that tryst Noble he would not be. 7 ‘Weel may ye be, my feiries five! And aye, what is your wills wi me?’ Then they cryd a' wi ae consent, Thou'rt welcome here, brave Noble, to me. 8 Wilt thou with us in England ride? And thy safe-warrand we will be, If we get a horse worth a hundred punds, Upon his back that thou shalt be. 9 ‘I dare not with you into England ride, The land-sergeant has me at feid; I know not what evil may betide For Peter of Whitfield his brother's dead. 10 ‘And Anton Shiel, he loves not me, For I gat twa drifts of his sheep; The great Earl of Whitfield loves me not, For nae gear frae me he eer coud keep. 11 ‘But will ye stay till the day gae down, Until the night come oer the grund, And I'll be a guide worth ony twa That may in Liddisdale be fund. 12 ‘Tho dark the night as pick and tar, I'll guide ye oer yon hills fu hie, And bring ye a' in safety back, If you'll be true and follow me.’ 13 He's guided them oer moss and muir, Oer hill and houp, and mony ae down, Til they came to the Foulbogshiel, And there brave Noble he lighted down. 14 Then word is gane to the land-sergeant, In Askirton where that he lay: ‘The deer that ye hae hunted lang Is seen into the Waste this day.’ 15 ‘Then Hobie Noble is that deer; I wat he carries the style fu hie! Aft has he beat your slough-hounds back, And set yourselves at little ee. 16 ‘Gar warn the bows of Hartlie-burn, See they shaft their arrows on the wa! Warn Willeva and Spear Edom, And see the morn they meet me a'. 17 ‘Gar meet me on the Rodrie-haugh, And see it be by break o day; And we will on to Conscowthart Green, For there, I think, w'll get our prey.’ 18 Then Hobie Noble has dreamd a dream, In the Foulbogshiel where that he lay; He thought his horse was neath him shot, And he himself got hard away. 19 The cocks could crow, and the day could dawn, And I wat so even down fell the rain; If Hobie had no wakend at that time, In the Foulbogshiel he had been tane or slain. 20 ‘Get up, get up, my feiries five — For I wat here makes a fu ill day — And the warst clock of this companie I hope shall cross the Waste this day.’ 21 Now Hobie thought the gates were clear, But, ever alas! it was not sae; They were beset wi cruel men and keen, That away brave Noble could not gae. 22 ‘Yet follow me, my feiries five, And see of me ye keep good ray, And the worst clock of this companie I hope shall cross the Waste this day.’ 23 There was heaps of men now Hobie before, And other heaps was him behind, That had he been as wight as Wallace was Away brave Noble he could not win. 24 Then Hobie he had but a laddies sword, But he did more than a laddies deed; In the midst of Conscouthart Green, He brake it oer Jers a Wigham's head. 25 Now they have tane brave Hobie Noble, Wi his ain bowstring they band him sae; And I wat his heart was neer sae sair As when his ain five band him on the brae. 26 They have tane him [on] for West Carlisle; They askd him if he knew the way; Whateer he thought, yet little he said; He knew the way as well as they. 27 They hae tane him up the Ricker-gate; The wives they cast their windows wide, And ilka wife to anither can say, That's the man loosd Jock o the Side! 28 ‘Fy on ye, women! why ca ye me man? For it's nae man that I'm usd like; I'm but like a forfoughen hound, Has been fighting in a dirty syke.’ 29 Then they hae tane him up thro Carlisle town, And set him by the chimney-fire; They gave brave Noble a wheat loaf to eat, And that was little his desire. 30 Then they gave him a wheat loaf to eat And after that a can o beer; Then they cried a', wi ae consent, Eat, brave Noble, and make good cheer! 31 Confess my lord's horse, Hobie, they say, And the morn in Carlisle thou's no die; ‘How shall I confess them?’ Hobie says, ‘For I never saw them with mine eye.’ 32 Then Hobie has sworn a fu great aith, By the day that he was gotten or born, He never had onything o my lord's That either eat him grass or corn. 33 ‘Now fare thee weel, sweet Mangerton! For I think again I'll neer thee see; I wad betray nae lad alive, For a' the goud in Christentie. 34 ‘And fare thee well now, Liddisdale, Baith the hie land and the law! Keep ye weel frae traitor Mains! For goud and gear he'll sell ye a'. 35 ‘I'd rather be ca'd Hobie Noble, In Carlisle, where he suffers for his faut, Before I were ca'd traitor Mains, That eats and drinks of meal and maut.’ 190 JAMIE TELFER OF THE FAIR DODHEAD JAMIE TELFER OF THE FAIR DODHEAD Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, I, 80, 1802; II, 3, 1833. 1 It fell about the Martinmas tyde, Whan our Border steeds get corn and hay, The Captain of Bewcastle hath bound him to ryde, And he's ower to Tividale to drive a prey. 2 The first ae guide that they met wi, It was high up in Hardhaughswire; The second guide that they met wi, It was laigh down in Borthwick water. 3 ‘What tidings, what tidings, my trusty guide?’ ‘Nae tidings, nae tidings, I hae to thee; But gin ye'll gae to the Fair Dodhead, Mony a cow's cauf I'll let thee see.’ 4 And when they cam to the Fair Dodhead, Right hastily they clam the peel; They loosed the kye out, ane and a', And ranshakled the house right weel. 5 Now Jamie Telfer's heart was sair, The tear aye rowing in his ee; He pled wi the Captain to hae his gear, Or else revenged he wad be. 6 The Captain turned him round and leugh; Said, Man, there's naething in thy house But ae auld sword without a sheath, That hardly now wad fell a mouse. 7 The sun was na up, but the moon was down, It was the gryming of a new-fa'n snaw; Jamie Telfer has run ten myles a-foot, Between the Dodhead and the Stobs's Ha. 8 And when he cam to the fair tower-yate, He shouted loud, and cried weel hie, Till out bespak auld Gibby Elliot, ‘Whae's this that brings the fray to me?’ 9 ‘It's I, Jamie Telfer o the Fair Dodhead, And a harried man I think I be; There's naething left at the Fair Dodhead But a waefu wife and bairnies three.’ 10 ‘Gae seek your succour at Branksome Ha, For succour ye'se get nane frae me; Gae seek your succour where ye paid black-mail, For, man, ye neer paid money to me.’ 11 Jamie has turned him round about, I wat the tear blinded his ee: ‘I'll neer pay mail to Elliot again, And the Fair Dodhead I'll never see. 12 ‘My hounds may a' rin masterless, My hawks may fly frae tree to tree, My lord may grip my vassal-lands, For there again maun I never be!’ 13 He has turned him to the Tiviot-side, Een as fast as he could drie, Till he cam to the Coultart Cleugh, And there he shouted baith loud and hie. 14 Then up bespak him auld Jock Grieve: ‘Whae's this that brings the fray to me?’ ‘It's I, Jamie Telfer o the Fair Dodhead, A harried man I trew I be. 15 ‘There's naething left in the Fair Dodhead But a greeting wife and bairnies three, And sax poor ca's stand in the sta, A' routing loud for their minnie.’ 16 ‘Alack a wae!’ quo auld Jock Grieve, ‘Alack, my heart is sair for thee! For I was married on the elder sister, And you on the youngest of a' the three.’ 17 Then he has taen out a bonny black, Was right weel fed wi corn and hay, And he's set Jamie Telfer on his back, To the Catslockhill to tak the fray. 18 And whan he cam to the Catslockhill, He shouted loud and cried weel hie, Till out and spak him William's Wat, ‘O whae's this brings the fray to me?’ 19 ‘It's I, Jamie Telfer o the Fair Dodhead, A harried man I think I be; The Captain o Bewcastle has driven my gear; For God's sake, rise and succour me!’ 20 ‘Alas for wae!’ quo William's Wat, ‘Alack, for thee my heart is sair! I never cam bye the Fair Dodhead That ever I fand thy basket bare.’ 21 He's set his twa sons on coal-black steeds, Himsel upon a freckled gray, And they are on wi Jamie Telfer, To Branksome Ha to tak the fray. 22 And when they cam to Branksome Ha, They shouted a' baith loud and hie, Till up and spak him auld Buccleuch, Said, Whae's this brings the fray to me? 23 ‘It's I, Jamie Telfer o the Fair Dodhead, And a harried man I think I be; There's nought left in the Fair Dodhead But a greeting wife and bairnies three.’ 24 ‘Alack for wae!’ quo the gude auld lord, ‘And ever my heart is wae for thee! But fye, gar cry on Willie, my son, And see that he cum to me speedilie. 25 ‘Gar warn the water, braid and wide! Gar warn it sune and hastilie! They that winna ride for Telfer's kye, Let them never look in the face o me! 26 ‘Warn Wat o Harden and his sons, Wi them will Borthwick water ride; Warn Gaudilands, and Allanhaugh, And Gilmanscleugh, and Commonside. 27 ‘Ride by the gate at Priesthaughswire, And warn the Currors o the Lee; As ye cum down the Hermitage Slack, Warn doughty Willie o Gorrinberry.’ 28 The Scotts they rade, the Scotts they ran, Sae starkly and sae steadilie, And aye the ower-word o the thrang Was, Rise for Branksome readilie! 29 The gear was driven the Frostylee up, Frae the Frostylee unto the plain, Whan Willie has lookd his men before, And saw the kye right fast driving. 30 ‘Whae drives thir kye,’ can Willie say, ‘To make an outspeckle o me?’ ‘It's I, the Captain o Bewcastle, Willie; I winna layne my name for thee.’ 31 ‘O will ye let Telfer's kye gae back? Or will ye do aught for regard o me? Or, by the faith of my body,’ quo Willie Scott, ‘I'se ware my dame's cauf's skin on thee.’ 32 ‘I winna let the kye gae back, Neither for thy love nor yet thy fear; But I will drive Jamie Telfer's kye In spite of every Scott that's here.’ 33 ‘Set on them, lads!’ quo Willie than; ‘Fye, lads, set on them cruellie! For ere they win to the Ritterford, Mony a toom saddle there sall be!’ 34 Then till 't they gaed, wi heart and hand; The blows fell thick as bickering hail; And mony a horse ran masterless, And mony a comely cheek was pale. 35 But Willie was stricken ower the head, And through the knapscap the sword has gane; And Harden grat for very rage, Whan Willie on the grund lay slane. 36 But he's taen aff his gude steel cap, And thrice he's waved it in the air; The Dinlay snaw was neer mair white Nor the lyart locks of Harden's hair. 37 ‘Revenge! revenge!’ auld Wat can cry; ‘Fye, lads, lay on them cruellie! We'll neer see Tiviot side again, Or Willie's death revenged sall be.’ 38 O mony a horse ran masterless, The splintered lances flew on hie; But or they wan to the Kershope ford, The Scotts had gotten the victory. 39 John o Brigham there was slane, And John o Barlow, as I hear say, And thirty mae o the Captain's men Lay bleeding on the grund that day. 40 The Captain was run through the thick of the thigh, And broken was his right leg-bane; If he had lived this hundred years, He had never been loved by woman again. 41 ‘Hae back the kye!’ the Captain said; ‘Dear kye, I trow, to some they be; For gin I suld live a hundred years There will neer fair lady smile on me.’ 42 Then word is gane to the Captain's bride, Even in the bower where that she lay, That her lord was prisoner in enemy's land, Since into Tividale he had led the way. 43 ‘I wad lourd have had a winding-sheet, And helped to put it ower his head, Ere he had been disgraced by the border Scot, Whan he ower Liddel his men did lead!’ 44 There was a wild gallant amang us a', His name was Watty wi the Wudspurs, Cried, On for his house in Stanegirthside, If ony man will ride with us! 45 When they cam to the Stanegirthside, They dang wi trees and burst the door; They loosed out a' the Captain's kye, And set them forth our lads before. 46 There was an auld wyfe ayont the fire, A wee bit o the Captain's kin: ‘Whae dar loose out the Captain's kye, Or answer to him and his men?’ 47 ‘It's I, Watty Wudspurs, loose the kye, I winna layne my name frae thee; And I will loose out the Captain's kye In scorn of a' his men and he.’ 48 Whan they cam to the Fair Dodhead, They were a wellcum sight to see, For instead of his ain ten milk-kye, Jamie Telfer has gotten thirty and three. 49 And he has paid the rescue-shot, Baith wi gowd and white monie, And at the burial o Willie Scott I wat was mony a weeping ee. 191 HUGHIE GRAME The Life and Death of Sir Hugh of the Grime HUGHIE GRAME—A a.

Here is a broad sword by my side, And if that thou canst conquer me, The victory will soon be try'd.’ 5 ‘I ner was afraid of a traytor bold, Although thy name be Hugh in the Grime; I'l make thee repent thy speeches foul, If day and life but give me time.’ 6 ‘Then do thy worst, good Lord Screw, And deal your blows as fast as you can; It will be try'd between me and you Which of us two shall be the best man.’ 7 Thus as they dealt their blows so free, And both so bloody at that time, Over the moss ten yeomen they see, Come for to take Sir Hugh in the Grime. 8 Sir Hugh set his back against a tree, And then the men encompast him round; His mickle sword from his hand did flee, And then they brought Sir Hugh to the ground. 9 Sir Hugh of the Grime now taken is And brought back to Garlard town; [Then cry'd] the good wives all in Garlard town, ‘Sir Hugh in the Grime, thou'st ner gang down.’ 10 The good Lord Bishop is come to the town, And on the bench is set so high; And every man was taxt to his crime, At length he called Sir Hugh in the Grime. 11 ‘Here am I, thou false bishop, Thy humours all to fulfill; I do not think my fact so great But thou mayst put it into thy own will.’ 12 The quest of jury-men was calld, The best that was in Garlard town; Eleven of them spoke all in a breast, ‘Sir Hugh in the Grime, thou'st ner gang down.’ 13 Then another questry-men was calld, The best that was in Rumary; Twelve of them spoke all in a breast, ‘Sir Hugh in the Grime, thou'st now guilty.’ 14 Then came down my good Lord Boles, Falling down upon his knee: ‘Five hundred pieces of gold would I give, To grant Sir Hugh in the Grime to me.’ 15 ‘Peace, peace, my good Lord Boles, And of your speeches set them by! If there be eleven Grimes all of a name, Then by my own honour they all should dye.’ 16 Then came down my good Lady Ward, Falling low upon her knee: ‘Five hundred measures of gold I'le give, To grant Sir Hugh of the Grime to me.’ 17 ‘Peace, peace, my good Lady Ward, None of your proffers shall him buy!

For tho ten Grahams were in his coat, Hughie Graham this day shall die.’ 6 Up then bespake the fair Whitefoord, As she sat by the bishop's knee: ‘Five hundred white pence I'll gee you, If ye'll gie Hughie Graham to me.’ 7 ‘O haud your tongue now, lady fair, And wi your pleading let it be! Altho ten Grahams were in his coat, It's for my honour he maun die.’ 8 They've taen him to the gallows-knowe, He looked to the gallows-tree, Yet never colour left his cheek, Nor ever did he blink his ee. 9 At length he looked round about, To see whatever he could spy, And there he saw his auld father, And he was weeping bitterly. 10 ‘O haud your tongue, my father dear, And wi your weeping let it be! Thy weeping's sairer on my heart Than a' that they can do to me. 11 ‘And ye may gie my brother John My sword that's bent in the middle clear, And let him cone at twelve o'clock, And see my pay the bishop's mare. 12 ‘And ye may gie my brother James My sword that's bent in the middle brown, And bid him come at four o'clock, And see his brother Hugh cut down. 13 ‘Remember me to Maggy my wife, The niest time ye gang oer the moor; Tell her, she staw the bishop's mare, Tell her, she was the bishop's whore. 14 ‘And ye may tell my kith and kin I never did disgrace their blood, And when they meet the bishop's cloak, To mak it shorter by the hood.’ Hughie the Græme HUGHIE GRAME—C “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 87, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of William Laidlaw. “From Robert Laidlaw.” 1 Gude Lord Scroop's to the huntin gane; He's ridden oer monie a moss an muir, An he has grippit Hughie the Græme, For stealin o the bishop's mare. 2 An they hae grippit Hughie the Græme, An brought him up thro Carlisle town; The lasses an lads they stood by the wa's, Cryin, Hughie the Græme, thou's no gae down! 3 They ha chosen a jury o men, The best that were i Coventry, An fifteen o them out a' at anse, ‘Hughie the Græme, thou art guiltie.’ 4 Than up bespak him gude Lord Hume, As he sat at the judge's knee; ‘Twentie white ousen, my gude lord, If ye'll grant Hughie the Græme to me.’ 5 ‘O no, no, no, my gude Lord Hume, For sooth an so it mauna be; For war there but twae Græms o the name, They sould be hangit a' for me.’ 6 'Twas up than spak her gude Lady Hume, As she sat by the judge's knee; ‘A peck o white pennies, my gude lord, If ye'll grant Hughie the Greame to me.’ 7 ‘O no, O no, my gude Lady Hume, For sooth an so it sal na be; For war there but twae Greames of the name, They soud be hangit a' for me.’ 8 ‘If I be guilty,’ said Hughie the Graeme, ‘Of me my friends sal hae nae lack;’ An he has luppen fifteen feet an three, An his hands they war tyed ahint his back. 9 He's lookit oer his left shouther, To see what he coud see, An there he saw his auld father commin, An he was weepin bitterlie. 10 ‘O had yer tongue, my father,’ he says, ‘An see that ye dinna weep for me, For they may ravish me o my life, But they canna banish me thrae the heavens hie. 11 ‘Fare ye weel, Maggie, my wife; The last time I came oer the muir, It was you berievt me o my life, An wi the bishop playd the w[hore].’ Sir Hugh in the Grime's Downfall HUGHIE GRAME—D Roxburghe Ballads, III, 456; edited for the Ballad Society by J.

He derry derry down 2 Hugh in the Grime was taken then And carried to Carlisle town; The merry women came out amain, Saying, The name of Grime shall never go down! 3 O then a jury of women was brought, Of the best that could be found; Eleven of them spoke all at once, Saying, The name of Grime shall never go down! 4 And then a jury of men was brought, More the pity for to be! Eleven of them spoke all at once, Saying, Hugh in the Grime, you are guilty. 5 Hugh in the Grime was cast to be hangd, Many of his friends did for him lack; For fifteen foot in the prisin he did jump, With his hands tyed fast behind his back. 6 Then bespoke our good Lady Ward, As she set on the bench so high: ‘A peck of white pennys I'll give to my lord, If he'll grant Hugh Grime to me. 7 ‘And if it be not full enough, I'll stroke it up with my silver fan; And if it be not full enough, I'll heap it up with my own hand.’ 8 ‘Hold your tongue now, Lady Ward, And of your talkitive let it be! There is never a Grime came in this court That at thy bidding shall saved be.’ 9 Then bespoke our good Lady Moor, As she sat on the bench so high: ‘A yoke of fat oxen I'll give to my lord, If he'll grant Hugh Grime to me.’ 10 ‘Hold your tongue now, good Lady Moor, And of your talkitive let it be! There is never a Grime came to this court That at thy bidding shall saved be.’ 11 Sir Hugh in the Grime lookd out of the door, With his hand out of the bar; There he spy'd his father dear, Tearing of his golden hair. 12 ‘Hold your tongue, good father dear, And of your weeping let it be! For if they bereave me of my life, They cannot bereave me of the heavens so high.’ 13 Sir Hugh in the Grime lookd out at the door, Oh, what a sorry heart had he! There [he] spy'd his mother dear, Weeping and wailing ‘Oh, woe is me!’ 14 ‘Hold your tongue now, mother dear, And of your weeping let it be! For if they bereave me of my life, They cannot bereave me of heaven's fee. 15 ‘I'll leave my sword to Johnny Armstrong That is made of mettal so fine, That when he comes to the border-side He may think of Hugh in the Grime.’ Sir Hugh the Græme HUGHIE GRAME—E Buchan's MSS, I, 53. 1 Lord Home he is a hunting gane, Through the woods and valleys clear, And he has taen Sir Hugh the Græme, For stealing o the bishop's mare. 2 They hae taen Sir Hugh the Græme, Led him down thro Strieveling town; Fifeteen o them cried a' at ance, ‘Sir Hugh the Græme he must go down!’ 3 They hae causd a court to sit, Mang a' their best nobilitie; Fifeteen o them cried a' at ance, ‘Sir Hugh the Græme he now must die!’ 4 Out it speaks the lady Black, And o her will she was right free: ‘A thousand pounds, my lord, I'll gie, If Hugh the Græme set free to me.’ 5 ‘Hold your tongue, ye Lady Black, And ye'll let a' your pleadings be! Though ye woud gie me thousands ten, It's for my honour he must die.’ 6 Then out it speaks her Lady Bruce, And o her will she was right free: ‘A hundred steeds, my lord, I'll gie, If ye'll gie Hugh the Græme to me.’ 7 ‘O hold your tongue, ye Lady Bruce, And ye'll let a' your pleadings be! Though a' the Græmes were in this court, It's for my honour he must die.’ 8 He looked over his shoulder, It was to see what he coud see, And there he saw his auld father, Weeping and wailing bitterlie. 9 ‘O hold your tongue, my old father, And ye'll let a' your mourning be! Though they bereave me o my life, They canno had the heavens frae me. 10 ‘Ye'll gie my brother John the sword That's pointed wi the metal clear, And bid him come at eight o'clock, And see me pay the bishop's mare. 11 ‘And, brother James, take here the sword That's pointed wi the metal brown; Come up the morn at eight o'clock, And see your brother putten down. 12 ‘And, brother Allan, take this sword That's pointed wi the metal fine; Come up the morn at eight o'clock, And see the death o Hugh the Græme. 13 ‘Ye'll tell this news to Maggy my wife, Niest time ye gang to Strievling town, She is the cause I lose my life, She wi the bishop playd the loon.’ 14 Again he ower his shoulder lookd, It was to see what he could see, And there he saw his little son, Was screaming by his nourice knee. 15 Then out it spake the little son, ‘Since 'tis the morn that he must die, If that I live to be a man, My father's death revengd shall be.’ 16 ‘If I must die,’ Sir Hugh replied, ‘My friends o me they will think lack;’ He leapd a wa eighteen feet high, Wi his hands bound behind his back. 17 Lord Home then raised ten armed men, And after him they did pursue; But he has trudged ower the plain As fast as ony bird that flew. 18 He looked ower his left shoulder, It was to see what he coud see; His brother John was at his back, And a' the rest o his brothers three. 19 Some they wound, and some they slew, They fought sae fierce and valiantly; They made his enemies for to yield, And sent Sir Hugh out ower the sea.

Sing, Faden dilly and faden dilly Sing, Faden dilly and deedle dan 2 But first he gaed to his gude wife, Wi a' the speed that he coud thole; ‘This wark,’ quo he, ‘Will never work Without a mare that has a foal.’ 3 Quo she, Thou has a gude gray mare, That'al rin oer hills baith law and hie; Gae tak the gray mare in thy hand, And leave the foal at hame wi me. 4 ‘And tak a halter in thy hose, And o thy purpose dinna fail; But wap it oer the Wanton's nose, And tie her to the gray mare's tail. 5 ‘Syne ca her out at yon back geate, Oer moss and muir and ilka dale; For she'll neer let the Wanton bite Till she come hame to her ain foal.’ 6 So he is up to England gane, Even as fast as he can hie, Till he came to King Henry's geate; And wha was there but King Henry? 7 ‘Come in,’ quo he, ‘thou silly blind harper, And of thy harping let me hear;’ ‘O, by my sooth,’ quo the silly blind harper, ‘I'd rather hae stabling for my mare.’ 8 The king he looks oer his left shoulder, And says unto his stable-groom, Gae tak the silly poor harper's mare, And tie her side my Wanton Brown. 9 And ay he harpit, and ay he carpit, Till a' the lords had fitted the floor; They thought the music was sae sweet, And they forgot the stable-door. 10 And ay he harpit, and ay he carpit, Till a' the nobles were sound asleep; Than quietly he took aff his shoon, And safly down the stair did creep. 11 Syne to the stable-door he hies, Wi tread as light as light coud be, And when he opned and gaed in, There he fand thirty gude steads and three. 12 He took the halter frae his hose, And of his purpose did na fail; He slipt it oer the Wanton's nose, And tied it to his gray mare's tail. 13 He ca'd her out at yon back geate, Oer moss and muir and ilka dale, And she loot neer the Wanton bite, But held her still gaun at her tail. 14 The gray mare was right swift o fit, And did na fail to find the way, For she was at Lochmaben geate Fu lang three hours ere 't was day. 15 When she came to the harper's door, There she gave mony a nicher and sneer; ‘Rise,’ quo the wife, ‘thou lazey lass, Let in thy master and his mare.’ 16 Then up she rose, pat on her claes, And lookit out through the lock-hole; ‘O, by my sooth,’ then quoth the lass, ‘Our mare has gotten a braw big foal!’ 17 ‘Come had thy peace, thou foolish lass, The moon's but glancing in thy eye; I'll wad my hail fee against a groat, It's bigger than eer our foal will be.’ 18 The neighbours too that heard the noise Cried to the wife to put hir in; ‘By my sooth,’ then quo the wife, ‘She's better than ever he rade on.’ 19 But on the morn, at fair day light, When they had ended a' thier chear, King Henry's Wanton Brown was stawn, And eke the poor old harper's mare. 20 ‘Allace! allace!’ says the silly blind harper, ‘Allace, allace, that I came here! In Scotland I've tint a braw cowte-foal, In England they've stawn my gude gray mare.’ 21 ‘Come had thy tongue, thou silly blind harper, And of thy allacing let me be; For thou shalt get a better mare, And weel paid shall thy cowte-foal be.’ Lochmaben Harper THE LOCHMABEN HARPER—B Glenriddell MSS, XI, 39, 1791; “from Dr Clapperton, of Lochmaben.” 1 Hard ye tell of the silly blind harper?

Sing, Fadle didle dodle didle Sing, Fadle didle fadle doo 2 He has mounted his auld gray mare, And ridden oer both hills and mire, Till he came to fair Carlisle town, And askd for stabling to his mare. 3 ‘Harp on, harp on, thou silly blind harper, ‘Some of thy harping let us hear;’ ‘By my sooth,’ says the silly blind harper, ‘I would rather hae stabling to my mare.’ 4 The king looked oer his left shoulder And called to his stable-groom: ‘Gae stable up the harper's mare, And just beyond the Wanton Brown.’ 5 Ay he carped, and ay he harped, Till a' the lords gaed thro the floor; But and the musick was sae sweet The groom forgot the key o the stable-door. 6 Ay he harped, and ay he carped, Till a' the lords fell fast asleep, And, like a fause deceiver as he was, He quickly down the stair did creep. 7 He pulld a colt-halter out o his hoe, On purpose as I shall to you tell; He sliped it oer the Wanton's nose, And tyed it to his gray mare's tail. 8 ‘My blessing light upon my wife! I think she be a daily flower; She told me to ken my ain gray mare When eer I felt her by the ewer.’ 9 ‘Harp on, harp on, thou silly blind harper, Some of thy harping let us hear:’ ‘Oh and alas!’ says the silly blind harper, ‘Oh and alas that eer I came here! 10 ‘For in Scotland I lost a good brown foal, And in England a good gray mare, 11 ‘Harp on, harp on, thou silly blind harper, Some of thy harping let us hear, And thy brown foal shall be well payed, And thou's hae a far better gray mare.’ 12 Ay he harped, and ay he carped, And some of his harping he let them hear, And his brown foal it was well payed, And he got a better gray mare. 13 His mare's away to Lochmaben, Wi mony a nicker and mony a sneer; His wife cry'd, Rise up, you lazy lass, Let in your master and his mare. 14 The lazy lass was loth to rise; She looked through a little hole; ‘By my troth,’ crys the lazy lass, ‘Our mare has brought a bonie foal.’ 15 ‘Rise up, rise up, thou lazy lass, And, een as the sun it shines sae clear, I'll wager my life against a groat The foal was better than ever the mare.’ The Auld Harper THE LOCHMABEN HARPER—C The Edinburgh Topographical, Traditional, and Antiquarian Magazine, 1849, p. 58; communicated by W.

The very first man that he did meet, They said it was King Henerie. 5 ‘Licht doon, licht doon, ye silly poor harper, And o your harping let me hear;’ ‘And by my sooth,’ quoth the silly poor harper, ‘I'd rather hae stabling for my mear.’ 6 O he lookit ower his left shoulder, And saw ane of the stable-grooms: ‘Go take the sillie poor harper's mear, And stable her by my Wanton Brown.’ 7 And aye he harpit, and aye he carpit, Till a' the nobles fell on the floor, And aye he harpit, and aye he carpit, Till they forgot the key of the stable-door. 8 And aye he harpit, and aye he carpit, Till a' the nobles fell fast asleep; He has taen his harp upon his back, And doon the stair did softly creep. 9 He has taen a halter frae his hose, And o his purpose did not fail; He coost a wap on Wanton's nose, And tyed her to his ain mear's tail. 10 He ca'd her through at the bye-yett, Through mony a syre and mony a hole; She never loot Wanton licht till she Was at Lochmaben, at her foal. 11 And she came oer Lochmaben heights, Wi mony a nicker and mony a sneeze, And waukend the silly poor harper's wife, As she was a sleeping at her ease. 12 ‘Rise up, rise up, ye servant-lass, Let in the maister and the mear;’ ‘By my sooth,’ quoth the servant-lass, ‘I think my maister be na here.’ 13 Up then rose the servant-lass, And lookit through a wee, wee hole; ‘By my sooth,’ quoth the servant-lass, ‘Our mear has gotten a waly foal.’ 14 ‘Ye clatter, ye clatter, ye servant-lass, It is the moon shines in your ee;’ ‘By my sooth,’ quoth the servant-lass, ‘It's mair than ever her ain will be.’ 15 It's whan the stable-groom awoke, Put a' the nobles in a fear; King Henerie's Wanton Brown was stown, And Oh! the silly poor harper's mear. 16 Out then spak the silly poor harper, Says, Oh, this loss I douna thole! In England fair a guid grey mear, In fair Scotland a guid cout-foal. 17 ‘Haud your tongue, ye sillie poor harper, And wi your carping let me be; Here's ten pounds for your auld gray mear, And a weel paid foal it's be to thee!’ 18 And O the silly poor harper's wife, She's aye first up in Lochmaben toun; She's stealing the corn and stealing the hay, And wappin it oer to Wanton Broun. The Jolly Harper THE LOCHMABEN HARPER—E Buchan's MSS, I, 35; Dixon, Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 37, Percy Society, vol. xvii. 1 There was a jolly harper-man, That harped aye frae toun to toun; A wager he made, with two knights he laid To steal King Henry's Wanton Brown. 2 Sir Roger he wagered five ploughs o land, Sir Charles wagered five thousand pound, And John he's taen the deed in hand, To steal King Henry's Wanton Brown. 3 He's taen his harp into his hand, And he gaed harping thro the toun, And as the king in his palace sat, His ear was touched wi the soun. 4 ‘Come in, come in, ye harper-man, Some o your harping let me hear;’ ‘Indeed, my liege, and by your grace, I'd rather hae stabling to my mare.’ 5 ‘Ye'll gang to yon outer court, That stands a little below the toun; Ye'll find a stable snug and neat, Where stands my stately Wanton Brown.’ 6 He's down him to the outer court, That stood a little below the toun; There found a stable snug and neat, For stately stood the Wanton Brown. 7 Then he has fixd a good strong cord Unto his grey mare's bridle-rein, And tied it unto that steed's tail, Syne shut the stable-door behin. 8 Then he harped on, an he carped on, Till all were fast asleep; Then down thro bower and ha he's gone, Even on his hands and feet. 9 He's to yon stable snug and neat, That lay a little below the toun; For there he placed his ain grey mare, Alang wi Henry's Wanton Brown. 10 ‘Ye'll do you down thro mire an moss, Thro mony bog an lairy hole; But never miss your Wanton slack; Ye'll gang to Mayblane, to your foal.’ 11 As soon's the door he had unshut, The mare gaed prancing frae the town, An at her bridle-rein was tied Henry's stately Wanton Brown. 12 Then she did rin thro mire an moss, Thro mony bog an miery hole; But never missed her Wanton slack Till she reachd Mayblane, to her foal. 13 When the king awaked from sleep He to the harper-man did say, O waken ye, waken ye, jolly John, We've fairly slept till it is day. 14 ‘Win up, win up, ye harper-man, Some mair o harping ye'll gie me:’ He said, My liege, wi a' my heart, But first my gude grey mare maun see. 15 Then forth he ran, and in he came, Dropping mony a feigned tear: ‘Some rogue[s] hae broke the outer court, An stown awa my gude grey mare.’ 16 ‘Then by my sooth,’ the king replied, ‘If there's been rogues into the toun, I fear, as well as your grey mare, Awa is my stately Wanton Brown.’ 17 ‘My loss is great,’ the harper said, ‘My loss is twice as great, I fear; In Scotland I lost a gude grey steed, An here I've lost a gude grey mare.’ 18 ‘Come on, come on, ye harper-man, Some o your music lat me hear; Well paid ye'se be, John, for the same, An likewise for your gude grey mare.’ 19 When that John his money received, Then he went harping frae the toun, But little did King Henry ken He'd stown awa his Wanton Brown. 20 The knights then lay ower castle-wa, An they beheld baith dale an down, An saw the jolly harper-man Come harping on to Striveling toun. 21 Then, ‘By my sooth,’ Sir Roger said, ‘Are ye returned back to toun? I doubt my lad ye hae ill sped Of stealing o the Wanton Brown.’ 22 ‘I hae been into fair England, An even into Lunan toun, An in King Henry's outer court, An stown awa the Wanton Brown.’ 23 ‘Ye lie, ye lie,’ Sir Charles he said, ‘An aye sae loud's I hear ye lie; Twall armed men, in armour bright, They guard the stable night and day.’ 24 ‘But I did harp them all asleep, An managed my business cunninglie; If ye make light o what I say, Come to my stable an ye'll see. 25 ‘My music pleasd the king sae well Mair o my harping he wishd to hear; An for the same he paid me well, And also for my gude grey mare.’ 26 Then he drew out a gude lang purse, Well stored wi gowd an white monie, An in a short time after this The Wanton Brown he lat them see. 27 Sir Roger produced his ploughs o land, Sir Charles produced his thousand pounds, Then back to Henry, the English king, Restored the stately Wanton Brown. 193 THE DEATH OF PARCY REED A song of Parcy Reed and the Three False Halls THE DEATH OF PARCY REED—A The late Robert White's papers; “Woodburn, December 1, 1829, Thomas Hedley, Bridge End, Corsonside Parish.” 1 The Liddesdale Crosiers hae ridden a race, And they had far better staid at hame, For they have lost a gallant gay, Young Whinton Crosier it was his name. 2 For Parcy Reed he has him taen, And he's delivered him to law, But auld Crosier has made answer That he'll gar the house of the Troughend fa. 3 So as it happened on a day That Parcy Reed is a hunting gane, And the three false Halls of Girsonsfield They all along with him are gane. 4 They hunted up and they hunted down, They hunted all Reedwater round, Till weariness has on him seized; At the Batinghope he's fallen asleep. 5 O some they stole his powder-horn, And some put water in his lang gun: ‘O waken, waken, Parcy Reed! For we do doubt thou sleeps too sound. 6 ‘O waken, O waken, Parcy Reed! For we do doubt thou sleeps too long; For yonder's the five Crosiers coming, They're coming by the Hingin Stane. 7 ‘If they be five men, we are four, If ye will all stand true to me; Now every one of you may take one, And two of them ye may leave to me.’ 8 ‘We will not stay, nor we dare not stay, O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee; For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed, That they will slay both us and thee.’ 9 ‘O stay, O stay, O Tommy Hall, O stay, O man, and fight with me! If we see the Troughend again, My good black mare I will give thee.’ 10 ‘I will not stay, nor I dare not stay, O Parcy Reed, to fight for thee; For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed, That they will slay both me and thee.’ 11 ‘O stay, O stay, O Johnnie Hall, O stay, O man, and fight for me! If I see the Troughend again, Five yoke of oxen I will give thee.’ 12 ‘I will not stay, nor I dare not stay, O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee; For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed, That they will slay both me and thee.’ 13 ‘O stay, O stay, O Willie Hall, O stay, O man, and fight for me! If we see the Troughend again, The half of my land I will give thee.’ 14 ‘I will not stay, nor I dare not stay, O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee; For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed, That they will slay both me and thee.’ 15 ‘Now foul fa ye, ye traitors all, That ever ye should in England won! You have left me in a fair field standin, And in my hand an uncharged gun. 16 ‘O fare thee well, my wedded wife! O fare you well, my children five! And fare thee well, my daughter Jane, That I love best that's born alive! 17 ‘O fare thee well, my brother Tom! And fare you well his children five! If you had been with me this day, I surely had been man alive. 18 ‘Farewell all friends! as for my foes, To distant lands may they be tane, And the three false Halls of Girsonsfield, They'll never be trusted nor trowed again.’ The Death of Parcy Reed THE DEATH OF PARCY REED—B Letters addressed to Sir Walter Scott, XIII, No 73, Abbotsford. “Parcy Reed, exactly as it is sung by an old woman of the name of Cathrine Hall, living at Fairloans, in the remotest corner of Oxnam parish:” James Telfer, Browndeanlaws, May 18, 1824. 1 O Parcy Reed has Crozer taen, And has deliverd him to the law; But Crozer says he'll do warse than that, For he'll gar the tower of the Troughend fa. 2 And Crozer says he will do warse, He will do warse, if warse can be; For he'll make the bairns a' fatherless, And then the land it may lie lea. 3 O Parcy Reed has ridden a raid, But he had better have staid at hame; For the three fause Ha's of Girsenfield Alang with him he has them taen. 4 He's hunted up, and he's hunted down, He's hunted a' the water of Reed, Till wearydness has on him taen, I the Baitinghope he's faen asleep. 5 And the fause, fause Ha's o Girsenfield, They'll never be trowed nor trusted again. 6 They've taen frae him his powther-bag, And they've put water i his lang gun; They've put the sword into the sheathe That out again it'll never come. 7 ‘Awaken ye, awaken ye, Parcy Reed, For I do fear ye've slept owre lang; For yonder are the five Crozers, A coming owre by the hinging-stane.’ 8 ‘If they be five and we be four, If that ye will stand true to me, If every man ye will take one, Ye surely will leave two to me. 9 ‘O turn, O turn, O Johny Ha, O turn now, man, and fight wi me; If ever ye come to Troughend again, A good black nag I will gie to thee; He cost me twenty pounds o gowd Atween my brother John and me.’ 10 ‘I winna turn, I canna turn; I darena turn and fight wi thee; For they will find out Parcy Reed, And then they'll kill baith thee and me.’ 11 ‘O turn, O turn now, Willie Ha, O turn, O man, and fight wi me, And if ever ye come to the Troughend again A yoke of owsen I will gie thee.’ 12 ‘I winna turn, I canna turn; I darena turn and fight wi thee; For they will find out Parcy Reed, And they will kill baith thee and me.’ 13 ‘O turn, O turn, O Thommy Ha, O turn now, man, and fight wi me; If ever ye come to the Troughend again, My daughter Jean I'll gie to thee.’ 14 ‘I winna turn, I darena turn; I winna turn and fight with thee; For they will find out Parcy Reed, And then they'll kill baith thee and me.’ 15 ‘O woe be to ye, traitors a'! I wish England ye may never win; Ye've left me in the field to stand, And in my hand an uncharged gun. 16 ‘Ye've taen frae me my powther-bag, And ye've put water i my lang gun; Ye've put the sword into the sheath That out again it'll never come. 17 ‘O fare ye weel, my married wife!

The lady did gie it a twig, Till it began to wicker. 7 But word's gane doun to Leith, And up to Embro toun, That the lady she has slain the laird, The laird o Waristoun. 8 Word has gane to her father, the grit Dunipace, And an angry man was he; Cries, Gar mak a barrel o pikes, And row her down some lea! 9 She said, Wae be to ye, Wariston, I wish ye may sink for sin! For I have been your wife These nine years, running ten; And I never loved ye sae well As now whan ye're lying slain. 10 ‘But tak aff this gowd brocade, And let my petticoat stay, And tie a handkerchief round my face, That the people may not see.’ Death of Lord Warriston THE LAIRD OF WARISTON—C Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 56. 1 ‘My mother was an ill woman, In fifteen years she married me; I hadna wit to guide a man, Alas! ill counsel guided me. 2 ‘O Warriston, O Warriston, I wish that ye may sink for sin! I was but bare fifteen years auld, Whan first I enterd your yates within. 3 ‘I hadna been a month married, Till my gude lord went to the sea; I bare a bairn ere he came hame, And set it on the nourice knee. 4 ‘But it fell ance upon a day, That my gude lord returnd from sea; Then I did dress in the best array, As blythe as ony bird on tree. 5 ‘I took my young son in my arms, Likewise my nourice me forebye, And I went down to yon shore-side, My gude lord's vessel I might spy. 6 ‘My lord he stood upon the deck, I wyte he haild me courteouslie: Ye are thrice welcome, my lady gay, Whae's aught that bairn on your knee?’ 7 She turnd her right and round about, Says, ‘Why take ye sic dreads o me? Alas! I was too young married, To love another man but thee.’ 8 ‘Now hold your tongue, my lady gay, Nae mair falsehoods ye'll tell to me; This bonny bairn is not mine, You've loved another while I was on sea.’ 9 In discontent then hame she went, And aye the tear did blin her ee; Says, Of this wretch I'll be revenged For these harsh words he's said to me. 10 She's counselld wi her father's steward What way she coud revenged be; Bad was the counsel then he gave, It was to gar her gude lord dee. 11 The nourice took the deed in hand, I wat she was well paid her fee; She kiest the knot, and the loop she ran, Which soon did gar this young lord dee. 12 His brother lay in a room hard by, Alas! that night he slept too soun; But then he wakend wi a cry, ‘I fear my brother's putten down. 13 ‘O get me coal and candle light, And get me some gude companie;’ But before the light was brought, Warriston he was gart dee. 14 They've taen the lady and fause nourice, In prison strong they hae them boun; The nourice she was hard o heart, But the bonny lady fell in swoon. 15 In it came her brother dear, And aye a sorry man was he: ‘I woud gie a' the lands I heir, O bonny Jean, to borrow thee.’ 16 ‘O borrow me, brother, borrow me? O borrowd shall I never be; For I gart kill my ain gude lord, And life is nae pleasure to me.’ 17 In it came her mother dear, I wyte a sorry woman was she: ‘I woud gie my white monie and gowd, O bonny Jean, to borrow thee.’ 18 ‘Borrow me, mother, borrow me? O borrowd shall I never be; For I gart kill my ain gude lord, And life's now nae pleasure to me.’ 19 Then in it came her father dear, I wyte a sorry man was he; Says, ‘Ohon, alas! my bonny Jean, If I had you at hame wi me! 20 ‘Seven daughters I hae left at hame, As fair women as fair can be; But I would gie them ane by ane, O bonny Jean, to borrow thee.’ 21 ‘O borrow me, father, borrow me? O borrowd shall I never be; I that is worthy o the death, It is but right that I shoud dee.’ 22 Then out it speaks the king himsell, And aye as he steps in the fleer; Says, ‘I grant you your life, lady, Because you are of tender year.’ 23 ‘A boon, a boon, my liege the king, The boon I ask, ye'll grant to me;’ ‘Ask on, ask on, my bonny Jean, Whateer ye ask it's granted be.’ 24 ‘Cause take me out at night, at night, Lat not the sun upon me shine, And take me to yon heading-hill, Strike aff this dowie head o mine. 25 ‘Ye'll take me out at night, at night, When there are nane to gaze and see, And hae me to yon heading-hill, And ye'll gar head me speedilie.’ 26 They've taen her out at nine at night, Loot not the sun upon her shine, And had her to yon heading-hill, And headed her baith neat and fine. 27 Then out it speaks the king himsell, I wyte a sorry man was he: ‘I've travelld east, I've travelld west, And sailed far beyond the sea, But I never saw a woman's face I was sae sorry to see dee. 28 ‘But Warriston was sair to blame, For slighting o his lady so; He had the wyte o his ain death, And bonny lady's overthrow.’ 195 LORD MAXWELL'S LAST GOODNIGHT Lord Maxwell's Last Goodnight LORD MAXWELL'S LAST GOODNIGHT—A Communicated to Percy by G.

Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 161, from a MS. of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. b. Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 4; “long preserved by tradition in Aberdeenshire, and procured from an intelligent individual resident in that part of Scotland.” 1 The eighteenth of October, A dismal tale to hear How good Lord John and Rothiemay Was both burnt in the fire. 2 When steeds was saddled and well bridled, And ready for to ride, Then out it came her false Frendraught, Inviting them to bide. 3 Said, ‘Stay this night untill we sup, The morn untill we dine; 'Twill be a token of good greement 'Twixt your good lord and mine.’ 4 ‘We'll turn again,’ said good Lord John; ‘But no,’ said Rothiemay, ‘My steed's trapand, my bridle's broken, I fear the day I'm fey.’ 5 When mass was sung, and bells was rung, And all men bound for bed, Then good Lord John and Rothiemay In one chamber was laid. 6 They had not long cast off their cloaths, And were but now asleep, When the weary smoke began to rise, Likewise the scorching heat. 7 ‘O waken, waken, Rothiemay! O waken, brother dear! And turn you to our Saviour; There is strong treason here.’ 8 When they were dressed in their cloaths, And ready for to boun, The doors and windows was all secur'd, The roof-tree burning down. 9 He did him to the wire-window, As fast as we could gang; Says, Wae to the hands put in the stancheons! For out we'll never win. 10 When he stood at the wire-window, Most doleful to be seen, He did espy her Lady Frendraught, Who stood upon the green. 11 Cried, Mercy, mercy, Lady Frendraught! Will ye not sink with sin? For first your husband killed my father, And now you burn his son. 12 O then out spoke her Lady Frendraught, And loudly did she cry; ‘It were great pity for good Lord John, But none for Rothiemay; But the keys are casten in the deep draw-well, Ye cannot get away.’ 13 While he stood in this dreadful plight, Most piteous to be seen, There called out his servant Gordon, As he had frantic been: 14 ‘O loup, O loup, my dear master! O loup and come to me! I'll catch you in my arms two, One foot I will not flee. 15 ‘O loup, O loup, my dear master! O loup and come away! I'll catch you in my arms two, But Rothiemay may lie.’ 16 ‘The fish shall never swim in the flood, Nor corn grow through the clay, Nor the fiercest fire that ever was kindled Twin me and Rothiemay. 17 ‘But I cannot loup, I cannot come, I cannot win to thee; My head's fast in the wire-window, My feet burning from me. 18 ‘My eyes are seething in my head, My flesh roasting also, My bowels are boiling with my blood; Is not that a woeful woe? 19 ‘Take here the rings from my white fingers, That are so long and small, And give them to my lady fair, Where she sits in her hall. 20 ‘So I cannot loup, I cannot come, I cannot loup to thee; My earthly part is all consumed, My spirit but speaks to thee.’ 21 Wringing her hands, tearing her hair, His lady she was seen, And thus addressed his servant Gordon, Where he stood on the green. 22 ‘O wae be to you, George Gordon!

Whats news hae you to me? 11 He's dune him to the weir-window, The stauncheons were oer strang; And there he saw the Lady Frendraught, Was walking on the green. 12 ‘Open yer doors now, Lady Frendraught, Ye'll open yer doors to me; And bonny's be the mornin-gift That I shall to you gie. 13 ‘I'll gie you a' Straboggie lands, And the laigh lands o Strathbrae, 14 ‘Now there's the rings frae my fingers, And the broach frae my breast-bone; Ye'll gae that to my gude ladye 15 ‘How can I loup, or how shall I loup? How can I loup to thee?

Scott; communicated to me by Mr John Stuart, Aberdeen, 11 October, 1832.” 1 It was in October the woe began — It lasts for now and aye, — The burning o the bonny house o fause Frendraught, Lord John and Rothiemay. 2 When they were in their saddles set, And ready to ride away, The lady sat down on her bare knees, Beseeching them to stay. 3 ‘Ye's hae a firlot o the gude red gowd, Well straiket wi a wan; And if that winna please you well, I'll heap it wi my han.’ 4 Then out it spake the gude Lord John, And said to Rothiemay, ‘It is a woman that we're come o, And a woman we'll obey.’ 5 When a' man was well drunken, And a' man bound for bed, The doors were lockd, the windows shut, And the keys were casten by. 6 When a' man was well drunken, And a' man bound for sleep, The dowy reek began to rise, And the joists began to crack. 7 He's deen him to the wire-window, And ruefu strack and dang; But they would neither bow nor brack, The staunchions were so strang. 8 He's deen him back and back again, And back to Rothiemay; Says, Waken, waken, brother dear! Waken, Rothiemay! 9 ‘Come let us praise the Lord our God, The fiftieth psalm and three; For the reek and smoke are us about, And there's fause treason tee. 10 ‘O mercy, mercy, Lady Frendraught! As ye walk on the green:’ ‘The keys are in the deep draw-well, The doors were lockt the streen.’ 11 ‘O woe be to you, Lady Frendraught! An ill death may you die! For think na ye this a sad torment Your own flesh for to burn?’ 12 George Chalmers was a bonny boy; He leapt the stanks so deep, And he is on to Rothiemay, His master for to help. 13 Colin Irving was a bonny boy, And leapt the stanks so deep: ‘Come down, come down, my master dear! In my arms I'll thee kep.’ 14 ‘Come down? come down? how can I come? How can I come to thee? My flesh is burning me about, And yet my spirit speaks to thee.’ 15 He's taen a purse o the gude red gowd, And threw it oer the wa: ‘It's ye'll deal that among the poor, Bid them pray for our souls a'.’ 16 He's taen the rings off his fingers, And threw them oer the wa; Says, Ye'll gie that to my lady dear, From me she'll na get more. 17 ‘Bid her make her bed well to the length, But no more to the breadth, For the day will never dawn That I'll sleep by her side.’ 18 Ladie Rothiemay came on the morn, She kneeled it roun and roun: ‘Restore your lodgers, fause Frendraught, That ye burnd here the streen. 19 ‘O were I like yon turtle-dove, Had I wings for to flie, I'd fly about fause Frendraught Crying vengeance till I die. 20 ‘Frendraught fause, all thro the ha's, Both back and every side; For ye've betrayd the gay Gordons, And lands wherein they ride. 21 ‘Frendraught fause, all thro the ha's; I wish you'd sink for sin; For first you killd my own good lord, And now you've burnd my son. 22 ‘I caredna sae muckle for my good lord I saw him in battle slain, But a' is for my own son dear, The heir o a' my lan. 23 ‘I caredna sae muckle for my good lord I saw him laid in clay, But a' is for my own son dear, The heir o Rothiemay.’ THE FIRE OF FRENDRAUGHT—D Ritson's Scotish Songs, 1794, II, 35; remembered by the Rev. Mr Boyd, translator of Dante, and communicated to the editor by J. C. Walker. 1 The reek it rose, and the flame it flew, And oh! the fire augmented high, Until it came to Lord John's chamber-window, And to the bed where Lord John lay. 2 ‘O help me, help me, Lady Frennet! I never ettled harm to thee; And if my father slew thy lord, Forget the deed and rescue me.’ 3 He looked east, he looked west, To see if any help was nigh; At length his little page he saw, Who to his lord aloud did cry: 4 ‘Loup doun, loup doun, my master dear! What though the window's dreigh and hie? I'll catch you in my arms twa, And never a foot from you I'll flee.’ 5 ‘How can I loup, you little page? How can I leave this window hie? Do you not see the blazing low, And my twa legs burnt to my knee?’ THE FIRE OF FRENDRAUGHT—E Kinloch MSS, VI, 27, in the handwriting of Joseph Robertson when a youth. Now wake, now wake you, Rothiemay! I dread you sleep oer soun; The bed is burnin us about And the curtain's faain down. 197 JAMES GRANT JAMES GRANT Motherwelll's MS., p. 470, communicated apparently by Buchan; ‘The Gordons and the Grants,’ Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 220. 1 ‘Away with you, away with you, James de Grant! And, Douglas, ye'll be slain; For Baddindalloch's at your gates, With many brave Highland men.’ 2 ‘Baddindalloch has no feud at me, And I have none at him; Cast up my gates baith broad and wide, Let Baddindalloch in.’ 3 ‘James de Grant has made a vaunt, And leaped the castle-wa; But, if he comes this way again, He'll no win sae well awa. 4 ‘Take him, take him, brave Gordons, O take him, fine fellows a'! If he wins but ae mile to the Highland hills, He'll defy you Gordons a'.’ 198 BONNY JOHN SETON Bonny John Seton BONNY JOHN SETON—A Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 15. 1 Upon the eighteenth day of June, A dreary day to see, The southern lords did pitch their camp Just at the bridge of Dee. 2 Bonny John Seton of Pitmeddin, A bold baron was he, He made his testament ere he went out, The wiser man was he. 3 He left his land to his young son, His lady her dowry, A thousand crowns to his daughter Jean, Yet on the nurse's knee. 4 Then out came his lady fair, A tear into her ee; Says, Stay at home, my own good lord, O stay at home with me! 5 He looked over his left shoulder, Cried, Souldiers, follow me! O then she looked in his face, An angry woman was she: ‘God send me back my steed again, But neer let me see thee!’ 6 His name was Major Middleton That manned the bridge of Dee, His name was Colonel Henderson That let the cannons flee. 7 His name was Major Middleton That manned the bridge of Dee, And his name was Colonel Henderson That dung Pitmeddin in three. 8 Some rode on the black and grey, And some rode on the brown, But the bonny John Seton Lay gasping on the ground. 9 Then bye there comes a false Forbes, Was riding from Driminere; Says, Here there lies a proud Seton; This day they ride the rear. 10 Cragievar said to his men, ‘You may play on your shield; For the proudest Seton in all the lan This day lies on the field.’ 11 ‘O spoil him! spoil him!’ cried Cragievar, ‘Him spoiled let me see; For on my word,’ said Cragievar, ‘He had no good will at me.’ 12 They took from him his armour clear, His sword, likewise his shield; Yea, they have left him naked there, Upon the open field. 13 The Highland men, they're clever men At handling sword and shield, But yet they are too naked men To stay in battle field. 14 The Highland men are clever men At handling sword or gun, But yet they are too naked men To bear the cannon's rung. 15 For a cannon's roar in a summer night Is like thunder in the air; There's not a man in Highland dress Can face the cannon's fire. The Death of John Seton BONNY JOHN SETON—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 136. 1 It fell about the month of June, On Tuesday, timouslie, The northern lords hae pitchd their camps Beyond the brig o Dee. 2 They ca'ed him Major Middleton That mand the brig o Dee; They ca ed him Colonel Henderson That gard the cannons flee. 3 Bonny John Seton o Pitmedden, A brave baron was he; He made his tesment ere he gaed, And the wiser man was he. 4 He left his lands unto his heir, His ladie her dowrie; Ten thousand crowns to Lady Jane, Sat on the nourice knee. 5 Then out it speaks his lady gay, ‘O stay my lord wi me; For word is come, the cause is won Beyond the brig o Dee.’ 6 He turned him right and round about, And a light laugh gae he; Says, I wouldna for my lands sae broad I stayed this night wi thee. 7 He's taen his sword then by his side, His buckler by his knee, And laid his leg in oer his horse, Said, Sodgers, follow me! 8 So he rade on, and further on, Till to the third mile corse; The Covenanters' cannon balls Dang him aff o his horse. 9 Up then rides him Cragievar, Said, Wha's this lying here? It surely is the Lord o Aboyne, For Huntly was not here. 10 Then out it speaks a fause Forbes, Lived up in Druminner; ‘My lord, this is a proud Seton, The rest will ride the thinner.’ 11 ‘Spulyie him, spulyie him,’ said Craigievar, ‘O spulyie him, presentlie; For I could lay my lugs in pawn He had nae gude will at me.’ 12 They've taen the shoes frae aff his feet, The garters frae his knee, Likewise the gloves upon his hands; They've left him not a flee. 13 His fingers they were sae sair swelld The rings would not come aff; They cutted the grips out o his ears, Took out the gowd signots. 14 Then they rade on, and further on, Till they came to the Crabestane, And Craigievar, he had a mind To burn a' Aberdeen. 15 Out it speaks the gallant Montrose, Grace on his fair body! ‘We winna burn the bonny burgh, We'll even laet it be.’ 16 Then out it speaks the gallant Montrose, ‘Your purpose I will break; We winna burn the bonny burgh, We'll never build its make. 17 ‘I see the women and their children Climbing the craigs sae hie; We'll sleep this night in the bonny burgh, And even lat it be.’ 199 THE BONNIE HOUSE O AIRLIE The Bonnie House o Airly; or, The Bonny House of Airly; or, The Bonny House of Airly; or, The Bonny House o Airly THE BONNIE HOUSE O AIRLIE—A a.

And oh, but she looks weary! And there she spy'd the great Argyll, Come to plunder the bonny house of Airlie. 4 ‘Come down, come down, my Lady Ogilvie, Come down, and kiss me fairly:’ ‘O I winna kiss the fause Argyll, If he should na leave a standing stane in Airlie.’ 5 He hath taken her by the left shoulder, Says, Dame where lies thy dowry? ‘O it's east and west yon wan water side, And it's down by the banks of the Airlie.’ 6 They hae sought it up, they hae sought it down, They hae sought it maist severely, Till they fand it in the fair plumb-tree That shines on the bowling-green of Airlie. 7 He hath taken her by the middle sae small, And O but she grat sairly! And laid her down by the bonny burn-side, Till they plundered the castle of Airlie. 8 ‘Gif my gude lord war here this night. As he is with King Charlie, Neither you, nor ony ither Scottish lord, Durst avow to the plundering of Airlie. 9 ‘Gif my gude lord war now at hame, As he is with his king, There durst nae a Campbell in a' Argyll Set fit on Airlie green. 10 ‘Ten bonny sons I have born unto him, The eleventh neer saw his daddy; But though I had an hundred mair, I'd gie them a' to King Charlie.’ THE BONNIE HOUSE O AIRLIE—B Kinloch MSS, V, 273. 1 It fell on a day, a clear summer day, When the corn grew green and bonny, That there was a combat did fall out 'Tween Argyle and the bonny house of Airly. 2 Argyle he did raise five hundred men, Five hundred men, so many, And he did place them by Dunkeld, Bade them shoot at the bonny house of Airly. 3 The lady looked over her own castle-wa, And oh, but she looked weary! And there she espied the gleyed Argyle, Come to plunder the bonny house of Airly. 4 ‘Come down the stair now, Madam Ogilvie, And let me kiss thee kindly; Or I vow and I swear, by the sword that I wear, That I winna leave a standing stone at Airly.’ 5 ‘O how can I come down the stair, And how can I kiss thee kindly, Since you vow and you swear, by the sword that you wear, That you winna leave a standing stone on Airly?’ 6 ‘Come down the stair then, Madam Ogilvie, And let me see thy dowry;’ ‘O't is east and it is west, and't is down by yon burn-side, And it stands at the planting sae bonny. 7 ‘But if my brave lord had been at hame this day, As he is wi Prince Charlie, There durst na a Campbell in all Scotland Set a foot on the bowling-green of Airly 8 ‘O I hae born him seven, seven sons, And an eighth neer saw his daddy, And tho I were to bear him as many more, They should a' carry arms for Prince Charlie.’ The Bonny House of Airley; or, Young Airly; or, The Bonny House o Airlie; or, The Bonny House o Airlie THE BONNIE HOUSE O AIRLIE—C a.

And there she spied the great Argyle, Came to plunder the bonny house of Airley. 4 ‘Come down stairs now, Madam,’ he says, ‘Now come down and kiss me fairly;’ ‘I'll neither come down nor kiss you,’ she says, ‘Tho you should na leave a standing stane in Airley.’ 5 ‘I ask but one favour of you, Argyle, And I hope you'll grant me fairly To tak me to some dark dowey glen, That I may na see the plundering of Airley.’ 6 He has taen her by the left shoulder, And O but she looked weary! And he has led her down to the top of the town, Bade her look at the plundering of Airley. 7 ‘Fire on, fire on, my merry men all, And see that ye fire clearly; For I vow and I swear by the broad sword I wear That I winna leave a standing stane in Airley. 8 ‘You may tell it to your lord,’ he says, ‘You may tell it to Lord Airley, That one kiss o his gay lady Wad hae sav'd all the plundering of Airley.’ 9 ‘If the great Sir John had been but at hame, As he is this night wi Prince Charlie, Neither Argyle nor no Scottish lord Durst hae plundered the bonny house of Airley. 10 ‘Seven, seven sons hae I born unto him, And the eight neer saw his dady, And altho I were to have a hundred more, The should a' draw their sword for Prince Charlie.’ THE BONNIE HOUSE O AIRLIE—D Kinloch MSS, V, 106, in the handwriting of James Beattie, and from the recitation of Elizabeth Beattie. 1 O gleyd Argyll has written to Montrose To see gin the fields they were fairly, And to see whether he should stay at hame, 'Or come to plunder bonnie Airly. 2 Then great Montrose has written to Argyll And that the fields they were fairly, And not to keep his men at hame, But to come and plunder bonnie Airly. 3 The lady was looking oer her castle-wa, She was carrying her courage sae rarely, And there she spied him gleyd Arguill, Was coming for to plunder bonnie Airly. 4 ‘Wae be to ye, gleyd Argyll! And are ye there sae rarely? Ye might hae kept your men at hame, And not come to plunder bonnie Airly.’ 5 ‘And wae be to ye, Lady Ogilvie! And are ye there sae rarely? Gin ye had bowed when first I bade, I never wad hae plunderd bonnie Airly.’ 6 ‘But gin my guid lord had been at hame, As he is wi Prince Charlie, There durst not a rebel on a' Scotch ground Set a foot on the bonnie green of Airly. 7 ‘But ye'll tak me by the milk-white hand, And ye'll lift me up sae rarely, And ye'll throw me outoure my [ain] castlewa, Let me neuer see the plundering of Airly.’ 8 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And he's lifted her up sae rarely, And he's thrown her outoure her ain castle-wa, And she neuer saw the plundering of Airly. 9 Now gleyd Argyll he has gane hame, Awa frae the plundering of Airly, And there he has met him Captain Ogilvie, Coming over the mountains sae rarely. 10 ‘O wae be to ye, gleyd Argyll! And are you there sae rarely? Ye might hae kept your men at hame, And no gane to plunder bonnie Airly.’ 11 ‘O wae be to ye, Captain Ogilvie! And are you there sae rarely? Gin ye wad hae bowed when first I bade, I neer wad hae plunderd bonnie Airly.’ 12 ‘But gin I had my lady gay, Bot and my sister Mary, One fig I wad na gie for ye a', Nor yet for the plundering of Airly.’ 200 THE GYPSY LADDIE Johny Faa, the Gypsy Laddie THE GYPSY LADDIE—A Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany, vol. iv, 1740. Here from the London edition of 1763, p. 427. 1 The gypsies came to our good lord's gate, And wow but they sang sweetly! They sang sae sweet and sae very compleat That down came the fair lady. 2 And she came tripping down the stair, And all her maids before her; As soon as they saw her well-far'd face, They coost the glamer oer her. 3 ‘Gae tak frae me this gay mantile, And bring to me a plaidie; For if kith and kin and a' had sworn, I'll follow the gypsie laddie. 4 ‘Yestreen I lay in a well-made bed, And my good lord beside me; This night I'll ly in a tenant's barn, Whatever shall betide me.’ 5 ‘Come to your bed,’ says Johny Faa, ‘Oh come to your bed, my deary; For I vow and I swear, by the hilt of my sword, That your lord shall nae mair come near ye.’ 6 ‘I'll go to bed to my Johny Faa, I'll go to bed to my deary; For I vow and I swear, by what past yestreen, That my lord shall nae mair come near me. 7 ‘I'll mak a hap to my Johnny Faa, And I'll mak a hap to my deary; And he's get a' the coat gaes round, And my lord shall nae mair come near me.’ 8 And when our lord came hame at een, And speir'd for his fair lady, The tane she cry'd, and the other reply'd, ‘She's away with the gypsie laddie.’ 9 ‘Gae saddle to me the black, black steed, Gae saddle and make him ready; Before that I either eat or sleep, I'll gae seek my fair lady.’ 10 And we were fifteen well-made men, Altho we were nae bonny; And we were a' put down for ane, A fair young wanton lady.

A fragment recited by Miss Fanny Walker, of Mount Pleasant, near Newburgh-on-Tay, as communicated by Mr Alexander Laing, 1873. 1 The gypsies they came to my lord Cassilis' yett, And O but they sang bonnie! They sang sae sweet and sae complete That down came our fair ladie. 2 She came tripping down the stairs, And all her maids before her; As soon as they saw her weel-far'd face, They coost their glamourie owre her. 3 She gave to them the good wheat bread, And they gave her the ginger; But she gave them a far better thing, The gold ring off her finger. 4 ‘Will ye go with me, my hinny and my heart? Will ye go with me, my dearie? And I will swear, by the staff of my spear, That your lord shall nae mair come near thee.’ 5 ‘Sae take from me my silk mantel, And bring to me a plaidie, For I will travel the world owre Along with the gypsie laddie. 6 ‘I could sail the seas with my Jockie Faa, I could sail the seas with my dearie; I could sail the seas with my Jockie Faa, And with pleasure could drown with my dearie. 7 They wandred high, they wandred low, They wandred late and early, Untill they came to an old tenant's-barn, And by this time she was weary. 8 ‘Last night I lay in a weel-made bed, And my noble lord beside me, And now I must ly in an old tenant's-barn, And the black crew glowring owre me.’ 9 ‘O hold your tongue, my hinny and my heart, O hold your tongue, my dearie, For I will swear, by the moon and the stars, That thy lord shall nae mair come near thee.’ 10 They wandred high, they wandred low, They wandred late and early, Untill they came to that wan water, And by this time she was wearie. 11 ‘Aften have I rode that wan water, And my lord Cassilis beside me, And now I must set in my white feet and wade, And carry the gypsie laddie.’ 12 By and by came home this noble lord, And asking for his ladie, The one did cry, the other did reply, ‘She is gone with the gypsie laddie.’ 13 ‘Go saddle to me the black,’ he says, ‘The brown rides never so speedie, And I will neither eat nor drink Till I bring home my ladie.’ 14 He wandred high, he wandred low, He wandred late and early, Untill he came to that wan water, And there he spied his ladie. 15 ‘O wilt thou go home, my hinny and my heart, O wilt thou go home, my dearie? And I'll close thee in a close room, Where no man shall come near thee.” 16 ‘I will not go home, my hinny and my heart, I will not go home, my dearie; If I have brewn good beer, I will drink of the same, And my lord shall nae mair come near me. 17 ‘But I will swear, by the moon and the stars, And the sun that shines so clearly, That I am as free of the gypsie gang As the hour my mother did bear me.’ 18 They were fifteen valiant men, Black, but very bonny, And they lost all their lives for one, The Earl of Cassillis' ladie. Davie Faw; or, Gypsie Davy THE GYPSY LADDIE—C Motherwell's MS., p. 381, from the recitation of Agnes Lyle, Kilbarchan, 27 July, 1825. 1 There cam singers to Earl Cassillis' gates, And oh, but they sang bonnie! They sang sae sweet and sae complete, Till down cam the earl's lady. 2 She cam tripping down the stair, And all her maids before her; As soon as they saw her weel-faurd face, They coost their glamourye owre her. 3 They gave her o the gude sweetmeats, The nutmeg and the ginger, And she gied them a far better thing, Ten gold rings aff her finger. 4 ‘Tak from me my silken cloak, And bring me down my plaidie; For it is gude eneuch,’ she said, ‘To follow a Gipsy Davy. 5 ‘Yestreen I rode this water deep, And my gude lord beside me; But this nicht I maun set in my pretty fit and wade, A wheen blackguards wading wi me. 6 ‘Yestreen I lay in a fine feather-bed, And my gude lord beyond me; But this nicht I maun lye in some cauld tenant's-barn, A wheen blackguards waiting on me.’ 7 ‘Come to thy bed, my bonny Jeanie Faw, Come to thy bed, my dearie, For I do swear, by the top o my spear, Thy gude lord'll nae mair come near thee.’ 8 When her good lord cam hame at nicht, It was asking for his fair ladye; One spak slow, and another whisperd out, ‘She's awa wi Gipsey Davy!’ 9 ‘Come saddle to me my horse,’ he said, ‘Come saddle and mak him readie! For I'll neither sleep, eat, nor drink Till I find out my lady.’ 10 They socht her up, they socht her doun, They socht her thro nations many, Till at length they found her out in Abbey dale, Drinking wi Gipsey Davy. 11 ‘Rise, oh rise, my bonnie Jeanie Faw, Oh rise, and do not tarry! Is this the thing ye promised to me When at first I did thee marry?’ 12 They drank her cloak, so did they her goun, They drank her stockings and her shoon, And they drank the coat that was nigh to her smock, And they pawned her pearled apron. 13 They were sixteen clever men, Suppose they were na bonny; They are a' to be hangd on ae tree, For the stealing o Earl Cassilis' lady. 14 ‘We are sixteen clever men, One woman was a' our mother; We are a' to be hanged on ae day, For the stealing of a wanton lady.’ The Egyptian Laddy THE GYPSY LADDIE—D Kinloch MSS, V, 331, in the handwriting of John Hill Burton; from a reciter who came from the vicinity of Craigievar. 1 There came Gyptians to Corse Field yeats, Black, tho they warna bonny; They danced so neat and they danced so fine, Till down came the bonny lady. 2 She came trippin down the stair, And her nine maidens afore her; But up and starts him Johny Fa, And he cast the glamour oer her. 3 ‘Ye'll take frae me this gay mantle, And ye'll gie to me a plaidie; For I shall follow Johny Fa, Lat weel or woe betide me.’ 4 They've taen frae her her fine mantle, And they've gaen to her a plaidie, And she's awa wi Johny Fa, Whatever may betide her. 5 When they came to a wan water, I wite it wasna bonny, 6 ‘Yestreen I wade this wan water, And my good lord was wi me; The night I man cast aff my shoes and wide, And the black bands widen wi me. 7 ‘Yestreen I lay in a well made bed, And my good lord lay wi me; The night I maun ly in a tenant's barn, And the black bands lyin wi me.’ 8 ‘Come to yer bed,’ says Johnie Fa, ‘Come to yer bed, my dearie, And I shall swer, by the coat that I wear, That my hand it shall never go near thee.’ 9 ‘I will never come to yer bed, I will never be yer dearie; For I think I hear his horse's foot That was once called my dearie.’ 10 ‘Come to yer bed,’ says Johny Fa, ‘Come to yer bed, my dearie, And I shall swear, by the coat that I wear, That my hand it shall never go oer thee.’ 11 ‘I will niver come to yer bed, I will niver be yer dearie; For I think I hear his bridle ring That was once called my dearie.’ 12 When that good lord came hame at night, He called for his lady; The one maid said, and the other replied, ‘She's aff wi the Gyptian laddy.’ 13 ‘Ye'll saddle to me the good black steed, Tho the brown it was never so bonny; Before that ever I eat or drink, I shall have back my lady.’ 14 ‘Yestreen we were fifteen good armed men; Tho black, we werena bonny; The night we a'ly slain for one, It's the Laird o Corse Field's lady.’ The Gypsie Laddie THE GYPSY LADDIE—E The Scottish Gallovidian Encyclopedia, by John Mactaggart, 1824, p. 284. 1 The gypsies they came to Lord Cassle's yet, And O but they sang ready! They sang sae sweet and sae complete That down came the lord's fair lady. 2 O she came tripping down the stair, Wi a' her maids afore her, And as soon as they saw her weelfared face They cuist their glaumry owre her. 3 She gaed to them the gude white bread, And they gaed to her the ginger, Then she gaed to them a far brawer thing, The gowd rings af her finger. 4 Quo she to her maids, There's my gay mantle, And bring to me my plaidy, And tell my lord whan he comes hame I'm awa wi a gypsie laddie. 5 For her lord he had to the hounting gane, Awa in the wild green wuddie, And Jockie Faw, the gypsie king, Saw him there wi his cheeks sae ruddy. 6 On they mounted, and af they rade, Ilk gypsie had a cuddy, And whan through the stincher they did prance They made the water muddy. 7 Quo she, Aft times this water I hae rade, Wi many a lord and lady, But never afore did I it wade To follow a gypsie laddie. 8 ‘Aft hae I lain in a saft feather-bed, Wi my gude lord aside me, But now I maun sleep in an auld reeky kilt, Alang wi a gypsie laddie.’ 9 Sae whan that the yirl he came hame, His servants a' stood ready; Some took his horse, and some drew his boots, But gane was his fair lady. 10 And whan he came ben to the parlour-door, He asked for his fair lady, But some denied, and ithers some replied, ‘She's awa wi a gypsie laddie.’ 11 ‘Then saddle,’ quoth he, ‘my gude black naig, For the brown is never sae speedy; As I will neither eat nor drink Till I see my fair lady. 12 ‘I met wi a cheel as I rade hame, And thae queer stories said he; Sir, I saw this day a fairy queen Fu pack wi a gypsie laddie. 13 ‘I hae been east, and I hae been west, And in the lang town o Kircadie, But the bonniest lass that ever I saw Was following a gypsie laddie.’ 14 Sae his lordship has rade owre hills and dales, And owre mony a wild hie mountain, Until that he heard his ain lady say, ‘Now my lord will be hame frae the hounting.’ 15 ‘Than will you come hame, my hinnie and my love?’ Quoth he to his charming dearie, ‘And I'll keep ye aye in a braw close room, Where the gypsies will never can steer ye.’ 16 Said she, ‘I can swear by the sun and the stars, And the moon whilk shines sae clearie, That I am as chaste for the gypsie Jockie Faw As the day my minnie did bear me.’ 17 ‘Gif ye wad swear by the sun,’ said he, ‘And the moon, till ye wad deave me, Ay and tho ye wad take a far bigger aith, My dear, I wadna believe ye. 18 ‘I'll tak ye hame, and the gypsies I'll hang, Ay, I'll make them girn in a wuddie, And afterwards I'll burn Jockie Faw, Wha fashed himself wi my fair lady. 19 Quoth the gypsies, We're fifteen weel-made men, Tho the maist o us be ill bred ay, Yet it wad be a pity we should a' hang for ane, Wha fashed himself wi your fair lady. 20 Quoth the lady, My lord, forgive them a', For they nae ill eer did ye, And gie ten guineas to the chief, Jockie Faw, For he is a worthy laddie. 21 The lord he hearkened to his fair dame, And O the gypsies war glad ay!

Cunningham], London, 1835, II, 346, taken down, as current in the north of England, from the recitation of John Martin, the painter. 1 The gypsies came to the Earl o Cassilis' gate, And O but they sang bonnie! They sang sae sweet and sae complete That down cam our fair ladie. 2 And she cam tripping down the stair, Wi her twa maids before her; As soon as they saw her weel-far'd face, They coost their glamer oer her. 3 ‘O come wi me,’ says Johnnie Faw, ‘O come wi me, my dearie, For I vow and swear, by the hilt of my sword, Your lord shall nae mair come near ye.’ 4 ‘Here, tak frae me this gay mantile, And gie to me a plaidie; Tho kith and kin and a' had sworn, I'll follow the gypsie laddie. 5 ‘Yestreen I lay in a weel-made bed, And my gude lord beside me; This night I'll lie in a tenant's barn, Whatever shall betide me. 6 ‘Last night I lay in a weel-made bed, Wi silken hangings round me; But now I'll lie in a farmer's barn, Wi the gypsies all around me. 7 ‘The first ale-house that we come at, We'll hae a pot o brandie; The next ale-house that we came at, We'll drink to gypsie Geordie.’ 8 Now when our lord cam home at een, He speir'd for his fair lady; The ane she cried, [the] tither replied, ‘She's awa wi the gypsie laddie.’ 9 ‘Gae saddle me the gude black steed; The bay was neer sae bonnie; For I will neither eat nor sleep Till I be wi my lady.’ 10 Then he rode east, and he rode west, And he rode near Strabogie, And there he found his ain dear wife, Drinking wi gypsie Geordie. 11 ‘And what made you leave your houses and land? Or what made you leave your money? Or what made you leave your ain wedded lord, To follow the gypsie laddie? 12 ‘Then come thee hame, my ain dear wife, Then come thee hame, my hinnie, And I do swear, by the hilt of my sword, The gypsies nae mair shall come near thee.’ 13 Then we were seven weel-made men, But lack! we were nae bonnie, And we were a' put down for ane, For the Earl o Cassilis' ladie.

O 2 The Earl of Castle's lady came down, With the waiting-maid beside her; As soon as her fair face they saw, They called their grandmother over. 3 They gave to her a nutmeg brown, And a race of the best ginger; She gave to them a far better thing, 'T was the ring from off her finger. 4 She pulld off her high-heeld shoes, They was made of Spanish leather; She put on her highland brog[u]es, To follow the gypsey loddy. 5 At night when my good lord came home, Enquiring for his lady, The waiting-maid made this reply, ‘She's following the gypsey loddy. 6 ‘Come saddle me my milk-white steed, Come saddle it so bonny, As I may go seek my own wedded wife, That's following the gypsey loddy. 7 ‘Have you been east? have you been west? Or have you been brisk and bonny? Or have you seen a gay lady, A following the gypsey loddy?’ 8 He rode all that summer's night, And part of the next morning; At length he spy'd his own wedded wife, She was cold, wet, and weary. 9 ‘Why did you leave your houses and land? Or why did you leave your money? Or why did you leave your good wedded lord, To follow the gypsey loddy?’ 10 ‘O what care I for houses and land? Or what care I for money? So as I have brewd, so will I return; So fare you well, my honey!’ 11 There was seven gypsies in a gang, And they was brisk and bonny, And they're to be hanged all on a row, For the Earl of Castle's lady. The Gipsy Laddie THE GYPSY LADDIE—H Shropshire Lolk-Lore, edited by Charlotte Sophia Burne, p. 550, as sung May 23, 1885, by gypsy children. 1 There came a gang o gipsies by, And they was singing so merry, O Till they gained the heart o my lady gay, 2 As soon as the lord he did come in, Enquired for his lady, O And some o the sarvants did-a reply, ‘Her's away wi the gipsy laddie.’ O 3 ‘O saddle me the bay, and saddle me the grey, Till I go and sarch for my lady;’ And some o the sarvants did-a reply, ‘Her's away wi the gipsy laddie.’ 4 And he rode on, and he rode off, Till he came to the gipsies' tentie, And there he saw his lady gay, By the side o the gipsy laddie. 5 ‘Didn't I leave you houses and land? And didn't I leave you money? Didn't I leave you three pretty babes As ever was in yonder green island?’ 6 ‘What care I for houses and land? And what care I for money? What do I care for three pretty babes?’ 7 ‘The tother night you was on a feather bed, Now you're on a straw one,’ THE GYPSY LADDIE—I From Miss Margaret Reburn, “as sung in County Meath, Ireland, about 1860.” 1 There come seven gypsies on a day, Oh, but they sang bonny! O And they sang so sweet, and they sang so clear, Down cam the earl's ladie. O 2 They gave to her the nutmeg, And they gave to her the ginger; But she gave to them a far better thing, The seven gold rings off her fingers. 3 When the earl he did come home, Enquiring for his ladie, One of the servants made this reply, ‘She's awa with the gypsie lad[d]ie.’ 4 ‘Come saddle for me the brown,’ he said, ‘For the black was neer so speedy, And I will travel night and day Till I find out my ladie. 5 ‘Will you come home, my dear?’ he said, ‘Oh will you come home, my honey? And, by the point of my broad sword, A hand I'll neer lay on you.’ 6 ‘Last night I lay on a good feather-bed, And my own wedded lord beside me, And tonight I'll lie in the ash-corner, With the gypsies all around me. 7 ‘They took off my high-heeled shoes, That were made of Spanish leather, And I have put on coarse Lowland brogues, To trip it oer the heather.’ 8 ‘The Earl of Cashan is lying sick; Not one hair I'm sorry; I'd rather have a kiss from his fair lady's lips Than all his gold and his money.’ The Gipsey Davy THE GYPSY LADDIE—J a. Written down by Newton Pepoun, as learned from a boy with whom he went to school in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, about 1845. b. From the singing of Mrs Farmer, born in Maine, as learned by her daughter, about 1840. 1 There was a gip came oer the land, He sung so sweet and gaily; He sung with glee, neath the wild wood tree, He charmed the great lord's lady. Ring a ding a ding go ding go da, Ring a ding a ding go da dy, Ring a ding a ding go ding go da, She's gone with the gipsey Davy. 2 The lord he came home late that night; Enquiring for his lady, ‘She's gone, she's gone,’ said his old servantman, ‘She's gone with the gipsey Davy.’ 3 ‘Go saddle me my best black mare; The grey is neer so speedy; For I'll ride all night, and I'll ride all day, Till I overtake my lady.’ 4 Riding by the river-side, The grass was wet and dewy; Seated with her gipsey lad, It's there he spied his lady. 5 ‘Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby? Would you forsake your own true love, And go with the gipsey Davy?’ 6 ‘Yes, I'll forsake my house and home, Yes, I'll forsake my baby; What care I for my true love? I love the gipsey Davy.’ 7 The great lord he rode home that night, He took good care of his baby, And ere six months had passed away He married another lady. Lord Garrick THE GYPSY LADDIE—K a.

Why did you leave your babies? Why did you leave your decent married man, To follow the roving gypsies?’ 6 ‘What cares I for my houses and my lands? What cares I for my babies?

A cloud o mist them weel conceald, As close as eer might be. 4 When they came to the Shaw burn, Said he, Sae weel we frame, I think it is convenient That we should sing a psalm. 5 When they came to the Lingly burn, As daylight did appear, They spy'd an aged father, And he did draw them near. 6 ‘Come hither, aged father,’ Sir David he did cry, ‘And tell me where Montrose lies, With all his great army.’ 7 ‘But first you must come tell to me, If friends or foes you be; I fear you are Montrose's men, Come frae the north country.’ 8 ‘No, we are nane o Montrose's men, Nor eer intend to be; I am Sir David Lesly, That's speaking unto thee.’ 9 “If you're Sir David Lesly, As I think weel ye be, I am sorry ye hae brought so few Into your company. 10 ‘There's fifteen thousand armed men Encamped on yon lee; Ye'll never be a bite to them, For aught that I can see. 11 ‘But halve your men in equal parts, Your purpose to fulfill; Let ae half keep the water-side, The rest gae round the hill. 12 ‘Your nether party fire must, Then beat a flying drum; And then they'll think the day's their ain, And frae the trench they'll come. 13 ‘Then, those that are behind them maun Gie shot, baith grit and sma; And so, between your armies twa, Ye may make them to fa.’ 14 ‘O were ye ever a soldier?’ Sir David Lesly said; ‘O yes; I was at Solway Flow, Where we were all betrayd. 15 ‘Again I was at curst Dunbar, And was a prisner taen, And many weary night and day In prison I hae lien.’ 16 ‘If ye will lead these men aright, Rewarded shall ye be; But, if that ye a traitor prove, I'll hang thee on a tree.’ 17 ‘Sir, I will not a traitor prove; Montrose has plunderd me; I'll do my best to banish him Away frae this country.’ 18 He halvd his men in equal parts, His purpose to fulfill; The one part kept the water-side, The other gaed round the hill. 19 The nether party fired brisk, Then turnd and seemd to rin; And then they a' came frae the trench, And cry'd, The day's our ain! 20 The rest then ran into the trench, And loosd their cannons a': And thus, between his armies twa, He made them fast to fa. 21 Now let us a' for Lesly pray, And his brave company, For they hae vanquishd great Montrose, Our cruel enemy. 203 THE BARON OF BRACKLEY The Baronne of Braikley; or, The Baron of Braikley; or, The Barrone of Brackley THE BARON OF BRACKLEY—A a.

Or say ye his lady, was making great care?’ 17 ‘I came by Brackley, and I was in there, But I saw his lady no makin great care. 18 ‘For she eat wi them, drank wi them, welcomed them in; She drank to the villain that killed her guid man. 19 ‘Woe to ye, Kate Fraser! sorry may yer heart be, To see yer brave baron's blood cum to yer knee.’ 20 There is dule in the kitchen, and mirth i the ha, But the Baron o B[r]ackley is dead and awa. The Baron of Braikly; or, The Baron of Brackley THE BARON OF BRACKLEY—C a. Jamieson-Brown MS., Appendix, p. viii, as transcribed for Jamieson by Rev. Andrew Brown, and sent him by Mrs Brown in a letter of June 18, 1801. b. Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 102; Mrs. Brown's copy combined with an imperfect one taken down by Sir W. Scott “from the recitation of two ladies, great-grandchildren of Farquharson of Inverey.” 1 O Inverey came down Dee side, whistling and playing; He's landed at Braikly's yates at the day dawing. 2 Says, Baron of Braikly, are ye within? There's sharp swords at the yate will gar your blood spin. 3 The lady raise up, to the window she went; She heard her kye lowing oer hill and oer bent. 4 ‘O rise up, John,’ she says, ‘turn back your kye; They're oer the hills rinning, they're skipping away.’ 5 ‘Come to your bed, Peggie, and let the kye rin, For were I to gang out, I would never get in.’ 6 Then she's cry'd on her women, they quickly came ben: ‘Take up your rocks, lassies, and fight a' like men. 7 ‘Though I'm but a woman, to head you I'll try, Nor let these vile Highland-men steal a' our kye.’ 8 Then up gat the baron, and cry'd for his graith; Says, Lady, I'll gang, tho to leave you I'm laith. 9 ‘Come, kiss me, my Peggie, nor think I'm to blame; For I may well gang out, but I'll never win in.’ 10 When the Baron of Braikly rade through the close, A gallanter baron neer mounted a horse. 11 Tho there came wi Inverey thirty and three, There was nane wi bonny Braikly but his brother and he. 12 Twa gallanter Gordons did never sword draw; But against four and thirty, wae's me, what was twa? 13 Wi swords and wi daggers they did him surround, And they've pierc'd bonny Braikly wi mony a wound. 14 Frae the head of the Dee to the banks of the Spey, The Gordons may mourn him, and bann Inverey. 15 ‘O came ye by Braikly, and was ye in there? Or saw ye his Peggy dear riving her hair?’ 16 ‘O I came by Braikly, and I was in there, But I saw not his Peggy dear riving her hair.’ 17 ‘O fye on ye, lady! how could ye do sae? You opend your yate to the faus Inverey.’ 18 She eat wi him, drank wi him, welcomd him in; She welcomd the villain that slew her baron. 19 She kept him till morning, syne bad him be gane, And showd him the road that he woud na be tane. 20 ‘Thro Birss and Aboyne,’ she says, ‘lyin in a tour, Oer the hills of Glentanor you'll skip in an hour.’ 21 There is grief in the kitchen, and mirth in the ha, But the Baron of Braikly is dead and awa. The Baron of Breachell THE BARON OF BRACKLEY—D Skene MS., p. 110; north of Scotland, 1802–3. 1 ‘Baron o Breachell, are ye within? The sharp souerd is at yer gate, Breachell, we'll gar yer blood spin.’ 2 ‘Thei'r at yer gate, Breachel, thei'r neither men nor lads, But fifty heard widifas, wi belted plaids.’ 3 ‘O if I had a man,’ she says, ‘as it looks I had nane, He widna sit in the house and see my kye tane. 4 ‘But lasses tak down yer rocks, and we will defend 5 ‘O kiss me, dear Peggy, and gee me down my gun, I may well ga out, but I'll never come in.’ 6 Out spak his brither, says, Gee me yer hand; I'll fight in yer cause sae lang as I may stand. 7 Whan the Baron o Breachell came to the closs, A braver baron neir red upon horse. 8 I think the silly heard widifas are grown fighten men. 9 First they killed ane, and syen they killed twa, And the Baron o Breachell is dead and awa. 10 They killed Sandy Gordon, Sandy Gordon o the Knock, The miller and his three sons, that lived at Glenmuick. 11 First they killed ane, and seyn they killed twa, And the Baron o Breachell is dead and awa. 12 Up came Crigevar and a' his fighten men: ‘Had I come an hour soonur, he sudna been slain.’ 13 For first they killed ane, and seyn they killed twa, And the Baron o Breachell is dead and awa. 14 ‘O came ye by Breachell, lads? was ye in their?

Saw ye Cathrin Gordon rivin her hair?’ 19 ‘We was at Glenmuik, lads, we was in there, We saw Cathrin Gordon rivin her hair. 20 ‘Wi the tear in her eye, seven bairns at her foot, The eighth on her knee 21 They killed Peter Gordon, Peter Gordon of the Knock, The miller and his three sons, that lived at Glenmuik. 22 First they killed ane, and syn they killed twa, And the Baron of Breachell is dead and awa. 204 JAMIE DOUGLAS Lord Douglas; or, The Laird of Blackwood JAMIE DOUGLAS—A Kinloch MSS, I, 93; from the recitation of Mary Barr, Lesmahago, Lanarkshire, May, 1827, and learned by her about sixty years before from an old dey at Douglas Castle. 1 I was a lady of high renown As lived in the north countrie; I was a lady of high renown Whan Earl Douglas loved me. 2 Whan we came through Glasgow toun, We war a comely sight to see; My gude lord in velvet green, And I mysel in cramasie. 3 Whan we cam to Douglas toun, We war a fine sight to behold; My gude lord in cramasie, And I myself in shining gold. 4 Whan that my auld son was born, And set upon the nurse's knee, I was as happy a woman as eer was born, And my gude lord he loved me. 5 But oh, an my young son was born, And set upon the nurse's knee, And I mysel war dead and gane, For a maid again I'll never be! 6 There cam a man into this house, And Jamie Lockhart was his name, And it was told to my gude lord That I was in the bed wi him. 7 There cam anither to this house, And a bad friend he was to me; He put Jamie's shoon below my bed-stock, And bade my gude lord come and see. 8 O wae be unto thee, Blackwood, And ae an ill death may ye dee! For ye was the first and the foremost man That parted my gude lord and me. 9 Whan my gude lord cam in my room, This grit falsehood for to see, He turnd about, and, wi a gloom, He straucht did tak farewell o me. 10 ‘O fare thee well, my once lovely maid! O fare thee well, once dear to me! O fare thee well, my once lovely maid! For wi me again ye sall never be.’ 11 ‘Sit doun, sit doun, Jamie Douglas, Sit thee doun and dine wi me, And Ill set thee on a chair of gold, And a silver towel on thy knee.’ 12 ‘Whan cockle-shells turn silver bells, And mussels they bud on a tree, Whan frost and snaw turns fire to burn, Then I'll sit down and dine wi thee.’ 13 O wae be unto thee, Blackwood, And ae an ill death may ye dee! Ye war the first and the foremost man That parted my gude lord and me. 14 Whan my father he heard word That my gude lord had forsaken me, He sent fifty o his brisk dragoons To fesh me hame to my ain countrie. 15 That morning before I did go, My bonny palace for to leave, I went into my gude lord's room, But alas! he wad na speak to me. 16 ‘Fare thee well, Jamie Douglas! Fare thee well, my ever dear to me! Fare thee well, Jamie Douglas! Be kind to the three babes I've born to thee.’ Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—B Kinloch MSS, V, 387, in the handwriting of John Hill Burton when a youth. 1 Waly, waly up the bank! And waly, waly down the brae! And waly, waly to yon burn-side, Where me and my love wunt to gae! 2 As I lay sick, and very sick, And sick was I, and like to die, And Blacklaywood put in my love's ears That he staid in bower too lang wi me. 3 As I lay sick, and very sick, And sick was I, and like to die, And walking into my garden green, I heard my good lord lichtlie me. 4 Now woe betide ye, Blacklaywood! I'm sure an ill death you must die; Ye'll part me and my ain good lord, And his face again I'll never see. 5 ‘Come down stairs now, Jamie Douglas, Come down stairs and drink wine wi me; I'll set thee into a chair of gold, And not one farthing shall it cost thee.’ 6 ‘When cockle-shells turn silver bells, And muscles grow on every tree, When frost and snaw turn fiery baas, I'll come down the stair and drink wine wi thee.’ 7 ‘What's needs me value you, Jamie Douglas, More than you do value me? The Earl of Mar is my father, The Duke of York is my brother gay. 8 ‘But when my father gets word o this, I trow a sorry man he'll be; He'll send four score o his soldiers brave To tak me hame to mine ain countrie.’ 9 As I lay owre my castell-wa, I beheld my father comin for me, Wi trumpets sounding on every side; But they werena music at a' for me. 10 ‘And fare ye weel now, Jamie Douglas! And fare ye weel, my children three! And fare ye weel, my own good lord! For my face again ye shall never see. 11 ‘And fare ye weel now, Jamie Douglas! And fare ye weel, my children three! And fare ye weel now, Jamie Douglas! But my youngest son shall gae wi me.’ 12 ‘What ails ye at yer youngest son, Sits smilin at the nurse's knee? I'm sure he never knew any harm, Except it was from his nurse or thee.’ 13 And when I was into my coaches set, He made his trumpets a' to soun. 14 I've heard it said, and it's oft times seen, The hawk that flies far frae her nest; And a' the world shall plainly see It's Jamie Douglas that I love best. 15 Ive heard it said, and [it's] oft times seen, The hawk that flies from tree to tree; And a' the world shall plainly see It's for Jamie Douglas I maun die. Lady Douglas and Blackwood JAMIE DOUGLAS—C Kinloch MSS, V, 207, I, 103; from John Rae, Lesmahago. 1 O wally, wally up yon bank! And wally down yon brae! And wally, wally up yon burn-side, Where me and my lord wont to gae! 2 I leand me on yon saugh sae sweet, I leand me on yon saugh sae sour, And my gude lord has forsaken me, And he swears he'll never loe me more. 3 There came a young man to this town, And Jamie Lockhart was his name; Fause Blackwood lilted in my lord's ear That I was in the bed wi him. 4 ‘Come up, come up, Jamie Douglas, Come up, come up and dine wi me, And I'll set thee in a chair of gold, And use you kindly on my knee.’ 5 ‘When cockle-shells turn silver bells, And mussels hing on every tree, When frost and snow turn fire-brands, Then I'll come up and dine wi thee.’ 6 When my father and mother they got word That my good lord had forsaken me, They sent fourscore of soldiers brave To bring me hame to my ain countrie. 7 That day that I was forc'd to go, My pretty palace for to leave, I went to the chamber were my lord lay, But alas! he wad na speak to me. 8 ‘O fare ye weel, Jamie Douglas! And fare ye weel, my children three! I hope your father will prove mair kind To you than he has been to me. 9 ‘You take every one to be like yoursel, You take every one that comes unto thee; But I could swear by the heavens high That I never knew anither man but thee. 10 ‘O foul fa ye, fause Blackwood, And an ill death now may ye die! For ye was the first occasioner Of parting my gude lord and me.’ 11 Whan we gaed in by Edinburgh town, My father and mither they met me, Wi trumpets sounding on every side; But alas! they could na cherish me. 12 ‘Hold your tongue, daughter,’ my father said, ‘And with your weeping let me be; And we'll get out a bill of divorce, And I'll get a far better lord to thee.’ 13 ‘O hold your tongue, father,’ she says, ‘And with your talking let me be; I wad na gie a kiss o my ain lord's lips For a' the men in the west country.’ 14 Oh an I had my baby born, And set upon the nurse's knee, And I myself were dead and gone! For a maid again I will never be. Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—D Kinloch MSS, I, 107: “West-Country version.” 1 I fell sick, and very, very sick, Sick I was, and like to dee; A friend o mine cam frae the west, A friend o mine came me to see, And the black told it to my gude lord He was oure lang in the chamber wi me. 2 ‘Come doun the stair, Jamie Douglas, Come doun and drink wine wi me; I'll set ye on a chair of gold, And not ae farthing will it cost thee.’ 3 ‘Whan cockle-shells turn siller bells, And fishes flee frae tree to tree, Whan frost and snaw turn fire-beams, I'll come doun and drink wine wi thee.’ 4 ‘What ails ye at your young son James, That sits upo the nurse's knee? I'm sure he never did ye no harm, If it war na for the nurse or me. 5 ‘What care I for you, Jamie Douglas? Not a small pin I value thee; For my father he is the Earl of York, And of that my mither's the gay ladie; They will send fourscore of his soldiers bold For to tak me hame to my ain countrie.’ 6 Whan I was set in my coach and six, Taking fareweel o my babies three, ‘I beg your father's grace to be kind, For your face again I'll never see.’ 7 As I was walking up London streets, My father was coming to meet me, Wi trumpets sounding on every side; But that was na music at a' for me. 8 ‘Hold your tongue, my dochter dear, And of your weeping let abee; A bill o divorcement I'll send to him, A far better match I'll get for thee.’ 9 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And with your folly let abee; There'll never man sleep in my twa arms, Sin my gude lord has forsaken me.’ 10 As I was sitting at my bouer-window, What a blythe sicht did I see! I saw four score of his soldiers bold, And I wishd that they were coming for me. 11 Out bespeaks the foremost man, And what a weel-spoken man was he! ‘If the Marquis o Douglas's lady be within, You'll bid her come doun and speak to me.’ 12 It's out bespak my auld father then, I wat an angry man was he; ‘Ye may gang back the road ye cam, For her face again ye'll never see.’ 13 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And with your folly let abee; For I'll ga back, and I'll ne'er return; Do ye think I love you as weel as he?’ 14 As I cam in by the Orange gate, What a blythe sicht did I see! I saw Jamie Douglas coming me to meet, And at his foot war his babies three. 15 ‘Ga fetch, ga fetch a bottle of wine, That I may drink to my gay ladie;’ She took the cup into her hand, But her bonnie heart it broke in three. The Laird o Blackwood JAMIE DOUGLAS—E Kinloch MSS, VII, 127; 24 April, 1826, from the recitation of Jenny Watson, Lanark, aged 73, who had it from her grandmother. 1 I lay sick, and very sick, And I was bad, and like to dee; A friend o mine cam to visit me, And Blackwood whisperd in my lord's ear That he was oure lang in chamber wi me. 2 ‘O what need I dress up my head, Nor what need I caim doun my hair, Whan my gude lord has forsaken me, And says he will na love me mair! 3 ‘But oh, an my young babe was born, And set upon some nourice knee, And I mysel war dead and gane! For a maid again I'll never be.’ 4 ‘Na mair o this, my dochter dear, And of your mourning let abee; For a bill of divorce I'll gar write for him, A mair better lord I'll get for thee.’ 5 ‘Na mair o this, my father dear, And of your folly let abee; For I wad na gie ae look o my lord's face For aw the lords in the haill cuntree. 6 ‘But I'll cast aff my robes o red, And I'll put on my robes o blue, And I will travel to some other land, To see gin my love will on me rue. 7 ‘There shall na wash come on my face, There shall na kaim come on my hair; There shall neither coal nor candle-licht Be seen intil my bouer na mair. 8 ‘O wae be to thee, Blackwood, And an ill death may ye dee! For ye've been the haill occasion Of parting my lord and me.’ Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—F Motherwell's MS, p. 507; from the recitation of old Mrs Brown, residing at Linsart, parish of Lochwinnoch, September, 1826. 1 Waly, waly up yon bank! And waly, waly up yon brae! And waly, waly by yon river-side, Where me and my love were wont to gae! 2 My mither tauld me when I was young That young men's love was ill to trow; But to her I would give nae ear, And alas! my ain wand dings me now. 3 But gin I had wist or I had kisst That young man's love was sae ill to win, I would hae lockt my heart wi a key o gowd, And pinnd it wi a sillar pin. 4 When lairds and lords cam to this toun, And gentlemen o a high degree, I took my auld son in my arms, And went to my chamber pleasantly. 5 But when gentlemen come thro this toun, And gentlemen o a high degree, I must sit alane in the dark, And the babie on the nurse's knee. 6 I had a nurse, and she was fair, She was a dearly nurse to me; She took my gay lord frae my side, And used him in her company. 7 Awa! awa, thou false Blackwood! Ay and an ill death may thou die! Thou wast the first occasioner Of parting my gay lord and me. 8 When I was sick, and very sick, Sick I was, and like to die, I drew me near to my stair-head, And I heard my own lord lichtly me. 9 ‘Come doun, come doun, thou Earl of March, Come doun, come doun and dine with me; I'll set thee on a chair of gowd, And treat thee kindly on my knee!’ 10 ‘When cockle-shells grow sillar bells, And mussells grow on every tree, When frost and snaw turns fiery ba's, Then I'll come doun and dine with thee.’ 11 When my father and mother got word That my gay lord had forsaken me, They sent three score of soldiers bold To bring me to my own countrie. 12 When I in my coach was set, My tenants all was with me tane; They set them doun upon their knees, And they begd me to come back again. 13 Fare ye weel, Jamie Douglas! And fare ye weel, my babies three! I wish your father may be kind To these three faces that I do see. 14 When we cam in by Edinbro toun, My father and mother they met me; The cymbals sounded on every side, But alace! the gave no comfort to me. 15 ‘Hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And of your weeping let abee, And I'll give him a bill of divorce, And I'll get as good a lord to thee.’ 16 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And of your scoffing let me bee; I would rather hae a kiss of my own lord's mouth As all the lords in the north countrie.’ Lord Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—G Motherwell's MS., p. 345. 1 O waly, waly up the bank! And waly, waly down the brae! And waly by yon river side, Where me and my lord was wont to gae! 2 An I had wit what I wit now, Before I came over the river Tay, I would hae staid at Lord Torchard's yetts, And I micht hae been his own lady gay. 3 When I lay sick, and was very sick, A friend of mine came me to see; When our Blacklywood told it in my lord's ears That he staid too long in chamber with me. 4 Woe be to thee, thou Blacklywood! I wish an ill death may thou die; For thou's been the first and occasion last That put strife between my good lord and me. 5 When my father he heard of this, His heart was like for to break in three; He sent fourscore of his soldiers brave For to take me home to mine own countree. 6 In the morning when I arose, My bonnie palace for to see, I came unto my lord's room-door, But he would not speak one word to me. 7 ‘Come down the stair, my lord Jamie Douglas, Come down and speak one word with me; I'll set thee in a chair of gold, And the never a penny it will cost thee.’ 8 ‘When cockle-shells grow silver bells, And grass grows over the highest tree, When frost and snaw turns fiery bombs, Then will I come down and drink wine with thee.’ 9 O what need I care for Jamie Douglas More than he needs to care for me? For the Lord of Murray's my father dear, And the Duke of York's daughter my mother be. 10 Thou thocht that I was just like thyself, And took every one that I did see; But I can swear by the heavens above That I never knew a man but thee. 11 But fare thee weel, my lord Jamie Douglas! And fare you weel, my sma childer three! God grant your father grace to be kind Till I see you all in my own countrie. 12 Quickly, quickly then rose he up, And quickly, quickly came he down; When I was in my coaches set, He made his trumpets all to sound. 13 As we came in by Edinburgh town, My loving father came to meet me, With trumpets sounding on every side; But it was not comfort at all to me. 14 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And of your weeping pray let abee; A bill of divorcement I'll to him send, And a better lord I will chose for thee.’ 15 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And of your flattery pray let abee; I'll never lye in another man's arms, Since my Jamie Douglas has forsaken me.’ 16 It's often said in a foreign land That the hawk she flies far from her nest; It's often said, and it's very true, He's far from me this day that I luve best. Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—H Motherwell's MS, p. 297; from the recitation of Mrs Traill of Paisley. 1 O waly, waly up the bank! And waly, waly doun the brae! And waly, waly by yon burn-side, Whare me and my luve was wont to gae! 2 If I had kent what I ken now, I wud neer hae crossed the waters o Tay; For an I had staid at Argyle's yetts, I might hae been his lady gay. 3 When I lay sick, and very sick, And very sick, just like to die, A gentleman, a friend of mine own, A gentleman came me to see; But Blackliewoods sounded in my luve's ears He was too long in chamer with me. 4 O woe be to thee, Blackliewoods, But an an ill death may you die! Thou's been the first and occasion last That eer put ill twixt my luve and me. 5 ‘Come down the stairs now, Jamie Douglas, Come down the stairs and drink wine wi me; I'll set thee in a chair of gold, And it's not one penny it will cost thee.’ 6 ‘When cockle-shells grow silver bells, And gowd grows oer yon lily lea, When frost and snaw grows fiery bombs, I will come down and drink wine wi thee.’ 7 ‘What ails you at our youngest son, That sits upon the nurse's knee? I'm sure he's never done any harm And it's not to his ain nurse and me.’ 8 My loving father got word of this, But and an angry man was he; He sent three score of his soldiers brave To take me to my own countrie. 9 ‘O fare ye weel now, Jamie Douglas! And fare ye weel, my children three! God grant your father may prove kind Till I see you in my own countrie.’ 10 When she was set into her coach 11 ‘Cheer up your heart, my loving daughter, Cheer up your heart, let your weeping bee! A bill of divorce I will write to him, And a far better lord I'll provide for thee.’ 12 It's very true, and it's often said, The hawk she's flown and she's left her nest; But a' the warld may plainly see They're far awa that I luve best. Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—I Motherwell's MS., p. 500; from Mrs Notman. 1 ‘O waly, waly up yon bank! And waly, waly down yon brae! And waly, waly by yon burn-bank, Where me and my lord wont to gae! 2 ‘A gentleman of good account, A friend of mine, came to visit me, And Blackly whispered in my lord's ears He was too long in chamber with me. 3 ‘When my father came to hear't, I wot an angry man was he; He sent five score of his soldiers bright To take me safe to my own countrie. 4 ‘Up in the mornin when I arose, My bonnie palace for to lea, And when I came to my lord's door, The neer a word he would speak to me. 5 ‘Come down, come down, O Jamie Douglas, And drink the Orange wine with me; I'll set thee in a chair of gold, That neer a penny it cost thee.’ 6 ‘When sea and sand turns foreign land, And mussels grow on every tree, When cockle-shells turn silver bells, I'll drink the Orange wine with thee.’ 7 ‘Wae be to you, Blackly,’ she said, ‘Aye and an ill death may you die! You are the first, and I hope the last, That eer made my lord lichtly me.’ 8 ‘Fare ye weel then, Jamie Douglas! I value you as little as you do me; The Earl of Mar is my father dear, And I soon will see my own countrie. 9 ‘Ye thought that I was like yoursell, And loving each ane I did see; But here I swear, by the day I die, I never loved a man but thee. 10 ‘Fare ye weel, my servants all! And you, my bonny children three! God grant your father grace to be kind Till I see you safe in my own countrie.’ 11 ‘As I came into Edinburgh toune, With trumpets sounding my father met me: But no mirth nor musick sounds in my ear, Since the Earl of March has forsaken me.’ 12 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And of your weeping let abee; I'll send a bill of divorce to the Earl of March, And get a better lord for thee.’ 13 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And of your folly let abee; No other lord shall lye in my arms, Since the Earl of March has forsaken me. 14 ‘An I had known what I know now, I'd never crossed the water o Tay, But stayed still at Atholl's gates; He would have made me his lady gay.’ 15 When she came to her father's lands, The tenants a' came her to see; Never a word she could speak to them, But the buttons off her clothes did flee. 16 ‘The linnet is a bonnie bird, And aften flees far frae its nest; So all the warld may plainly see They're far awa that I luve best.’ Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—J Motherwell's MS., p. 299; from the recitation of Rebecca Dunse, a native of Galloway, 4 May, 1825. “A song of her mother's, an old woman.” 1 O waly, waly up yon bank! And waly, waly doun yon brae! And waly, waly by yon burn-side, Where me and my luve used to gae! 2 Oh Johnie, Johnie, but love is bonnie A little while, when it is new; But when love grows aulder, it grows mair caulder, And it fades awa like the mornin dew. 3 I leaned my back against an aik, I thocht it was a trusty tree; But first [it] bowed, and syne it brak, And sae did my fause luve to me. 4 Once I lay sick, and very sick, And a friend of mine cam to visit me, But the small bird whispered in my love's ears That he was ower lang in the room wi me. 5 ‘It's come down stairs, my Jamie Douglas, Come down stairs, luve, and dine wi me; I'll set you on a chair of gold, And court ye kindly on my knee.’ 6 ‘When cockle-shells grow silver bells, And gold it grows on every tree, When frost and snaw turns fiery balls, Then, love, I'll come down and dine wi thee.’ 7 If I had known what I know now, That love it was sae ill to win, I should neer hae wet my cherry cheek For onie man or woman's son. 8 When my father he cam to know That my first luve had sae slighted me, He sent four score of his soldiers bright To guard me home to my own countrie. 9 Slowly, slowly rose I up, And slowly, slowly I came down, And when he saw me sit in my coach, He made his drums and trumpets sound. 10 It's fare ye weel, my pretty palace! And fare ye weel, my children three! And I hope your father will get mair grace, And love you better than he's done to me. 11 When we came near to bonnie Edinburgh toun, My father cam for to meet me; He made his drums and trumpets sound, But they were no comfort at all to me. 12 ‘It's hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And of your weeping pray let be; For a bill of divorcement I'll send to him, And a better husband I'll you supply.’ 13 ‘O hold your tongue, my father dear, And of your folly pray now let be; For there's neer a lord shall enter my bower, Since my first love has so slighted me.’ Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—K Motherwell's MS., p. 302; from Jean Nicol. 1 O waly, waly up the bank! And waly, waly doun the brae! And waly by yon river-side, Where me and my love were wont to gae! 2 A gentleman, a friend of mine, Came to the toun me for to see, 3 ‘Come doun the stair, Jamie Douglas, Come doun the stair and drink wine wi me; For a chair of gold I will set thee in, And not one farthing it will cost thee.’ 4 ‘When cockle-shells grow siller bells, And mussels grow on ilka tree, When frost and snaw turns out fire-bombs, Then I'll come doun and drink wine wi thee.’ 5 But when her father heard of this, O but an angry man was he! And he sent four score of his ain regiment To bring her hame to her ain countrie. 6 O when she was set in her coach and six, And the saut tear was in her ee, Saying, Fare you weel, my bonnie palace! And fare ye weel, my children three! 7 O when I came into Edinburgh toun, My loving father for to see, The trumpets were sounding on every side, But they were not music at all for me. 8 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And of your folly I pray let be; For a bill of divorcement I'll send him, And a better lord I'll provide for thee.’ 9 ‘O hold your tongue, my father dear, And of your folly I pray let be; For if I had stayed in fair Orange Green, I might have been his gay ladye.’ Jamie Douglas JAMIE DOUGLAS—L Finlay's Scottish Ballads, II, 1, a collation of three copies, one of which was M. 1 When I fell sick, an very sick, An very sick, just like to die, A gentleman of good account He cam on purpose to visit me; But his blackie whispered in my lord's ear He was owre lang in the room wi me. 2 ‘Gae, little page, an tell your lord, Gin he will come and dine wi me I'll set him on a chair of gold And serve him on my bended knee.’ 3 The little page gaed up the stair: ‘Lord Douglas, dine wi your ladie; She'll set ye on a chair of gold, And serve you on her bended knee.’ 4 ‘When cockle-shells turn silver bells, When wine drieps red frae ilka tree, When frost and snaw will warm us a', Then I'll cum down an dine wi thee.” 5 But whan my father gat word o this, O what an angry man was he! He sent fourscore o his archers bauld To bring me safe to his countrie. 6 When I rose up then in the morn, My goodly palace for to lea, I knocked at my lord's chamber-door, But neer a word wad he speak to me. 7 But slowly, slowly, rose he up, And slowly, slowly, cam he down, And when he saw me set on my horse, He caused his drums and trumpets soun. 8 ‘Now fare ye weel, my goodly palace! And fare ye weel, my children three! God grant your father grace to love you Far more than ever he loved me.’ 9 He thocht that I was like himsel, That had a woman in every hall; But I could swear, by the heavens clear, I never loved man but himsel. 10 As on to Embro town we cam, My guid father he welcomed me; He caused his minstrels meet to sound, It was nae music at a' to me. 11 ‘Now haud your tongue, my daughter dear, Leave off your weeping, let it be; For Jamie's divorcement I'll send over; Far better lord I'll provide for thee.’ 12 ‘O haud your tongue, my father dear, And of such talking let me be; For never a man shall come to my arms, Since my lord has sae slighted me.’ 13 O an I had neer crossed the Tweed, Nor yet been owre the river Dee, I might hae staid at Lord Orgul's gate, Where I wad hae been a gay ladie. 14 The ladies they will cum to town, And they will cum and visit me; But I'll set me down now in the dark, For ochanie! who'll comfort me? 15 An wae betide ye, black Fastness, Ay, and an ill deid may ye die! Ye was the first and foremost man Wha parted my true lord and me.

From recitation. 1 ‘O billie, billie, bonny billie, Will ye go to the wood wi me? We'll ca our horse hame masterless, An gar them trow slain men are we.’ 2 ‘O no, O no!’ says Earlstoun, ‘For that's the thing that mauna be; For I am sworn to Bothwell Hill, Where I maun either gae or die.’ 3 So Earlstoun rose in the morning, An mounted by the break o day, An he has joind our Scottish lads, As they were marching out the way. 4 ‘Now, farewell, father! and farewell, mother! An fare ye weel, my sisters three! An fare ye well, my Earlstoun! For thee again I'll never see.’ 5 So they're awa to Bothwell Hill, An waly, they rode bonnily! When the Duke o Monmouth saw them comin, He went to view their company. 6 ‘Ye're welcome, lads,’ then Monmouth said, ‘Ye're welcome, brave Scots lads, to me; And sae are you, brave Earlstoun, The foremost o your company. 7 ‘But yield your weapons ane an a', O yield your weapons, lads, to me; For, gin ye'll yield your weapons up, Ye'se a' gae hame to your country.’ 8 Out then spak a Lennox lad, And waly, but he spoke bonnily! ‘I winna yield my weapons up, To you nor nae man that I see.’ 9 Then he set up the flag o red, A' set about wi bonny blue: ‘Since ye'll no cease, and be at peace, See that ye stand by ither true.’ 10 They stelld their cannons on the height, And showrd their shot down in the how, An beat our Scots lads even down; Thick they lay slain on every know. 11 As eer you saw the rain down fa, Or yet the arrow frae the bow, Sae our Scottish lads fell even down, An they lay slain on every know. 12 ‘O hold your hand,’ then Monmouth cry'd, ‘Gie quarters to yon men for me;’ But wicked Claverhouse swore an oath His cornet's death revengd sud be. 13 ‘O hold your hand,’ then Monmouth cry'd, ‘If ony thing you'll do for me; Hold up your hand, you cursed Græme, Else a rebel to our king ye'll be.’ 14 Then wicked Claverhouse turnd about — I wot an angry man was he — And he has lifted up his hat, And cry'd, God bless his Majesty! 15 Than he's awa to London town, Ay een as fast as he can dree; Fause witnesses he has wi him taen, An taen Monmouth's head frae his body. 16 Alang the brae beyond the brig, Mony brave man lies cauld and still; But lang we'll mind, and sair we'll rue, The bloody battle of Bothwell Hill. 207 LORD DELAMERE The Long-armed Duke LORD DELAMERE—A Taken down from recitation in Derbyshire, and first printed, about 1843, in a periodical called The Story Teller; afterwards in Notes and Queries, First Series, V, 243, by C. W. G. 1 Good people, give attention, a story you shall hear, It is of the king and my lord Delamere; The quarrel it arose in the Parliament House, Concerning some taxations going to be put in force. Ri toora loora la. 2 Says my lord Delamere to his Majesty soon, ‘If it please you, my liege, of you I'll soon beg a boon.’ ‘Then what is your boon? let me it understand:’ ‘It's to have all the poor men you have in your land. 3 ‘And I'll take them to Cheshire, and there I will sow Both hempseed and flaxseed, and [hang] them all in a row. Why, they'd better be hanged, and stopped soon their breath, If it please you, my liege, than to starve them to death.’ 4 Then up starts a French lord, as we do hear, Saying, ‘Thou art a proud Jack,’ to my lord Delamere; ‘Thou oughtest to be stabbed’ — then he turnd him about — ‘For affronting the king in the Parliament House.’ 5 Then up starts his grace, the Duke of Devonshire, Saying, I'll fight in defence of my lord Delamere. Then a stage was erected, to battle they went, To kill or to be killed was our noble duke's intent. 6 The very first push, as we do understand, The duke's sword he bended it back into his hand. He waited a while, but nothing he spoke, Till on the king's armour his rapier he broke. 7 An English lord, who by that stage did stand, Threw Devonshire another, and he got it in his hand: ‘Play low for your life, brave Devonshire,’ said he, ‘Play low for your life, or a dead man you will be.’ 8 Devonshire dropped on his knee, and gave him his death-wound; O then that French lord fell dead upon the ground. The king called his guards, and he unto them did say, ‘Bring Devonshire down, and take the dead man away.’ 9 ‘No, if it please you, my liege, no! I've slain him like a man; I'm resolved to see what clothing he's got on. Oh, fie upon your treachery, your treachery!’ said he, ‘Oh, king, 'twas your intention to have took my life away. 10 ‘For he fought in your armour, whilst I have fought in bare; The same thou shalt win, king, before thou does it wear.’ Then they all turned back to the Parliament House, And the nobles made obesiance with their hands to their mouths. 11 ‘God bless all the nobles we have in our land, And send the Church of England may flourish still and stand; For I've injured no king, no kingdom, nor no crown, But I wish that every honest man might enjoy his own.’ Devonshire's Noble Duel with Lord Danby, in the year 1687 LORD DELAMERE—B Llewellynn Jewitt, Ballads and Songs of Derbyshire, 1867, p. 55, from a broad-sheet. 1 Good people give attention to a story you shall hear: Between the king and my lord Delamere, A quarrel arose in the Parliament House, Concerning the taxes to be put in force. With my fal de ral de ra. 2 I wonder, I wonder that James, our good king, So many hard taxes upon the poor should bring; So many hard taxes, as I have heard them say Makes many a good farmer to break and run away. 3 Such a rout has been in the parliament, as I hear, Betwixt a Dutch lord and my lord Delamere. He said to the king, as he sat on the throne, ‘If it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon.’ 4 ‘O what is thy boon? Come, let me understand.’ ‘'Tis to give me all the poor you have in the land; I'll take them down to Cheshire, and there I will sow Both hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them in a row. 5 ‘It's better, my liege, they should die a shorter death Than for your Majesty to starve them on earth.’ With that up starts a Dutch lord, as we hear, And he says, ‘Thou proud Jack,’ to my lord Delamere, 6 ‘Thou ought to be stabbed,’ and he turned him about, ‘For affronting the king in the Parliament House.’ Then up got a brave duke, the Duke of Devonshire, Who said, I will fight for my lord Delamere. 7 ‘He is under age, as I'll make it appear, So I'll stand in defence of my lord Delamere.’ A stage then was built, and to battle they went, To kill or be killed it was their intent. 8 The very first blow, as we understand, Devonshire's rapier went back to his hand; Then he mused awhile, but not a word spoke, When against the king's armour his rapier he broke. 9 O then he stept backward, and backward stept he, And then stept forward my lord Willoughby; He gave him a rapier, and thus he did say; Play low, Devonshire, there's treachery, I see. 10 He knelt on his knee, and he gave him the wound, With that the Dutch lord fell dead on the ground: The king calld his soldiers, and thus he did say: Call Devonshire down, take the dead man away. 11 He answered, My liege, I've killed him like a man, And it is my intent to see what clothing he's got on. O treachery! O treachery! as I well may say, It was your intent, O king, to take my life away. 12 ‘He fought in your armour, while I fought him bare, And thou, king, shalt win it before thou dost it wear; I neither do curse king, parliament, or throne, But I wish every honest man may enjoy his own. 13 ‘The rich men do flourish with silver and gold, While poor men are starving with hunger and cold; And if they hold on as they have begun, They'll make little England pay dear for a king.’ LORD DELAMERE—C Llewellynn Jewitt's Ballads and Songs of Derbyshire, p. 57. “Another version, which I have in MS., has, besides many minor variations, these verses.” 1 O the Duchess of Devonshire was standing hard by; Upon her dear husband she cast her lovely eye: ‘Oh, fie upon treachery! there's been treachery I say, It was your full intent to have taen my duke's life away.’ 2 Then away to the parliament these votes all went again, And there they acted like just and honest men. I neither curse my king, nor kingdom, crown or throne, But I wish every honest man to enjoy but what is his own. Lord Delaware; or, Lord Delamare LORD DELAMERE—D T. Lyle's Ancient Ballads and Songs, p. 135, 1827, as “noted down from the singing of a gentleman,” and then “remodelled and smoothed down” by the editor. 1 In the Parliament House a great rout has been there, Betwixt our good king and the lord Delaware: Says Lord Delaware to his Majesty full soon, ‘Will it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon?’ 2 ‘What's your boon?’ says the king, ‘now let me understand.’ ‘It's, give me all the poor men we've starving in this land, And without delay I'll hie me to Lincolnshire, To sow hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them all there. 3 ‘For with hempen cord it's better to stop each poor man's breath Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to death.’ Up starts a Dutch lord, who to Delaware did say, Thou deservest to be stabbd! then he turnd himself away. 4 ‘Thou deservest to be stabbd, and the dogs have thine ears, For insulting our king, in this parliament of peers.’ Up sprang a Welsh lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire: ‘In young Delaware's defence, I'll fight this Dutch lord, my sire. 5 ‘For he is in the right, and I'll make it so appear; Him I dare to single combat, for insulting Delaware.’ A stage was soon erected, and to combat they went; For to kill or to be killd, it was either's full intent. 6 But the very first flourish, when the heralds gave command, The sword of brave Devonshire bent backward on his hand. In suspense he paused a while, scannd his foe before he strake, Then against the king's armour his bent sword he brake. 7 Then he sprang from the stage to a soldier in the ring, Saying, Lend your sword, that to an end this tragedy we bring. Though he's fighting me in armour, while I am fighting bare, Even more than this I'd venture for young Lord Delaware. 8 Leaping back on the stage, sword to buckler now resounds, Till he left the Dutch lord a bleeding in his wounds. This seeing, cries the king to his guards without delay, Call Devonshire down! take the dead man away! 9 ‘No,’ says brave Devonshire, ‘I've fought him as a man; Since he's dead, I will keep the trophies I have won. For he fought me in your armour, while I fought him bare, And the same you must win back, my liege, if ever you them wear. 10 ‘God bless the Church of England! may it prosper on each hand, And also every poor man now starving in this land. And while I pray success may crown our king upon his throne, I'll wish that every poor man may long enjoy his own.’ 208 LORD DERWENTWATER Lord Dunwaters; or, Lord Derwentwater LORD DERWENTWATER—A Motherwell's MS., p. 331, July 19, 1825, “from the recitation of Agnes Lile, Kilbarchan, a woman verging on fifty;” learned from her father, who died fourteen years before, at the age of eighty. 1 Our king has wrote a lang letter, And sealed it owre with gold; He sent it to my lord Dunwaters, To read it if he could. 2 He has not sent it with a boy, with a boy, Nor with anie Scotch lord; But he's sent it with the noblest knight Eer Scotland could afford. 3 The very first line that my lord did read, He gave a smirkling smile; Before he had the half o't read, The tears from his eyes did fall. 4 ‘Come saddle to me my horse,’ he said, ‘Come saddle to me with speed; For I must away to fair London town, For me was neer more need.’ 5 Out and spoke his lady gay, In child-bed where she lay: ‘I would have you make your will, my lord Dunwaters, Before you go away.’ 6 ‘I leave to you, my eldest son, My houses and my land; I leave to you, my second son, Ten thousand pounds in hand. 7 ‘I leave to you, my lady gay — You are my wedded wife — I leave to you, the third of my estate; That'll keep you in a lady's life.’ 8 They had not rode a mile but one, Till his horse fell owre a stane: ‘It's warning gude eneuch,’ my lord Dunwaters said, ‘Alive I'll neer come hame.’ 9 When they came into fair London town, Into the courtiers' hall, The lords and knichts in fair London town Did him a traitor call. 10 ‘A traitor! a traitor!’ says my lord, ‘A traitor! how can that be, An it was na for the keeping of five thousand men To fight for King Jamie? 11 ‘O all you lords and knichts in fair London town, Come out and see me die; O all you lords and knichts into fair London town, Be kind to my ladie. 12 ‘There's fifty pounds in my richt pocket, Divide it to the poor; There's other fifty pounds in my left pocket, Divide it from door to door.’ Lord Derwentwater LORD DERWENTWATER—B Notes and Queries, First Series, XII, 492, 1855; learned some forty five years before from an old gentleman, who, about 1773, got it by heart from an old washerwoman singing at her tub. 1 The king he wrote a love-letter, And he sealed it up with gold, And he sent it to Lord Derwentwater, For to read it if he could. 2 The first two lines that he did read, They made him for to smile; But the next two lines he looked upon Made the tears from his eyes to fall. 3 ‘Oh,’ then cried out his lady fair, As she in child-bed lay, ‘Make your will, make your will, Lord Derwentwater, Before that you go away.’ 4 ‘Then here's for thee, my lady fair, A thousand pounds of beaten gold, To lead you a lady's life.’ 5 his milk-white steed, The ring dropt from his little finger, And his nose it began to bleed. 6 He rode, and he rode, and he rode along, Till he came to Westminster Hall, Where all the lords of England's court A traitor did him call. 7 ‘Oh, why am I a traitor?’ said he; ‘Indeed, I am no such thing; I have fought the battles valiantly Of James, our noble king.’ 8 O then stood up an old gray-headed man, With a pole-axe in his hand: ‘'Tis your head, 'tis your head, Lord Derwentwater, 'Tis your head that I demand.’ 9 His eyes with weeping sore, He laid his head upon the block, And words spake never more. LORD DERWENTWATER—C Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards, 1812, p. 225. 1 The king has written a broad letter, And seald it up with gold, And sent it to the lord of Derwentwater, To read it if he would. 2 He sent it with no boy, no boy, Nor yet with eer a slave, But he sent it with as good a knight As eer a king could have. 3 When he read the three first lines, He then began to smile; And when he read the three next lines The tears began to sile. Lord Derntwater LORD DERWENTWATER—D Kinloch MSS, I, 323. 1 The king has written a braid letter, And seald it up wi gowd, And sent it to Lord Derntwater, To read it if he coud. 2 The first lines o't that he read, A blythe, blythe man was he; But ere he had it half read through, The tear blinded his ee. 3 ‘Go saddle to me my milk-white horse, Go saddle it with speed; For I maun ride to Lun[n]on town, To answer for my head.’ 4 ‘Your will, your will, my lord Derntwater, Your will before ye go; For you will leave three dochters fair, And a wife to wail and woe.’ 5 ‘My will, my will, my lady Derntwater? Ye are my wedded wife; Be kind, be kind to my dochters dear, If I should lose my life.’ 6 He set his ae fit on the grund, The tither on the steed; The ring upon his finger burst, And his nose began to bleed. 7 He rode till he cam to Lunnon town, To a place they ca Whiteha; And a' the lords o merry England A traitor him gan ca. 8 ‘A traitor! a traitor! O what means this? A traitor! what mean ye?’ ‘It's a' for the keeping o five hundred men To fecht for bonny Jamie.’ 9 Then up started a gray-headed man, Wi a braid axe in his hand: ‘Your life, your life, my lord Derntwater, Your life's at my command.’ 10 ‘My life, my life, ye old gray-headed man, My life I'll freely gie; But before ye tak my life awa Let me speak twa words or three. 11 ‘I've fifty pounds in ae pocket, Go deal it frae door to door; I've fifty five i the other pocket, Go gie it to the poor. 12 ‘The velvet coat that I hae on, Ye may tak it for your fee; And a' ye lords o merry Scotland Be kind to my ladie!’ Lord Derwentwater LORD DERWENTWATER—E Communicated to Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, XI, 499, 1873, by Mr J.

Morris, as taken down by him from the recitation of a woman nearly seventy years of age, at Ulverston, North Lancashire. 1 The king wrote a letter to my lord Derwentwater, And he sealed it with gold; He sent it to my Lord Derwentwater, To read it if he could. 2 He sent it by no boy, He sent it by no slave, But he sent it by as true a knight As heart could wish or have. 3 The very first line that he looked upon Made him for to laugh and to smile; The very next line that he looked upon, The tears from his eyes did fall. 4 He called to his stable-boy To saddle his bonny grey steed, ‘That I unto loving London May ride away with speed.’ 5 His wife heard him say so, In childbed as she lay; Says she, ‘My lord Derwentwater, Make thy will before thou goest away.’ 6 ‘It's to my little son I give My houses and my land, And to my little daughter Ten thousand pounds in hand. 7 ‘And unto thee, my lady gay, Who is my wedded wife, The third part of my estate thou shalt have, To maintain thee through thy life.’ 8 He set his foot in the level stirrup, And mounted his bonny grey steed; The gold rings from his fingers did break, And his nose began for to bleed. 9 He had not ridden past a mile or two, When his horse stumbled over a stone; ‘These are tokens enough,’ said my lord Derwentwater, ‘That I shall never return.’ 10 He rode and he rode till he came to merry London, And near to that famous hall; The lords and knights of merry London, They did him a traitor call. 11 ‘A traitor! a traitor! a traitor!’ he cried, ‘A traitor! how can that be, Unless it's for keeping five hundred men For to fight for King Jamie?’ 12 It's up yon steps there stands a good old man, With a broad axe in his hand; Says he, ‘Now, my lord Derwentwater, Thy life's at my command.’ 13 ‘My life, my life, thou good old man, My life I'll give to thee, And the green coat of velvet on my back Thou mayst take it for thy fee. 14 ‘There's fifty pounds and five in my right pocket, Give that unto the poor; There's twenty pounds and five in my left pocket, Deal that from door to door.’ 15 Then he laid his head on the fatal block, Lord Arnwaters LORD DERWENTWATER—F Buchan's MSS, II, 478. 1 The king has written a broad letter, And seald it with his hand, And sent it on to Lord Arnwaters, To read and understand. 2 Now he has sent it by no boy, No boy, nor yet a slave, But one of England's fairest knights, The one that he would have. 3 When first he on the letter lookd, Then he began to smile; But ere he read it to an end, The tears did trickling fall. 4 He calld upon his saddle-groom To saddle his milk-white steed, ‘For I unto London must go, For me there is much need.’ 5 Out then speaks his gay lady, In child-bed where she lay: ‘Make your will, make your will, my knight, For fear ye rue the day.’ 6 ‘I'll leave unto my eldest son My houses and my lands; I'll leave unto my youngest son Full forty thousand pounds. 7 ‘I'll leave unto my gay lady, And to my loving wife, The second part of my estate, To maintain a lady's life.’ 8 He kissd her on the pillow soft, In child-bed where she lay, And bade farewell, neer to return, Unto his lady gay. 9 He put his foot in the stirup, His nose began to bleed; The ring from's finger burst in two When he mounted on his steed. 10 He had not rode a mile or two Till his horse stumbled down; ‘A token good,’ said Lord Arnwaters, ‘I'll never reach London town.’ 11 But when into Westminster Hall, Amongst the nobles all, ‘A traitor, a traitor, Lord Arnwaters, A traitor,’ they did him call. 12 ‘A traitor? a traitor how call ye me? And a traitor how can I be For keeping seven thousand valiant men To fight for brave Jamie?’ 13 Up then came a brave old man, With a broad ax in his hand: ‘Your life, your life, Lord Arnwaters, Your life's at my command.’ 14 ‘My life, my life, my brave old man, My life I'll give to thee, And the coat of green that's on my back You shall have for your fee. 15 ‘There's fifty pounds in one pocket, Pray deal't among the poor; There's fifty and four in the other pocket, Pray deal't from door to door. 16 ‘There's one thing more I have to say, This day before I die; To beg the lords and nobles all To be kind to my lady.’ Lord Dunwaters LORD DERWENTWATER—G Motherwell's MS., p. 126, from the recitation of Mrs Trail, Paisley, July 9, 1825: a song of her mother's. 1 The king has wrote a long letter, And sealed it with his han, And he has sent it to my lord Dunwaters, To read it if he can. 2 The very first line he lookit upon, It made him to lauch and to smile; The very next line he lookit upon, The tear from his eye did fall. 3 ‘As for you, my auldest son, My houses and my land; And as for you, my youngest son, Ten thousand pound in hand. 4 ‘As for you, my gay lady, You being my wedded wife, The third of my estate I will leave to you, For to keep you in a lady's life.’ Lord Derwentwater's Death LORD DERWENTWATER—H Shropshire Folk-Lore, edited by Charlotte Sophia Burne, p. 537; as recited in 1881 by Mrs Dudley, of Much Wenlock. 1 The king he wrote a letter, And sealëd it with gold, And sent it to Lor Derwentwater, To read it if he could. 2 The first three lines he looked upon, They made him to smile; And the next three lines he looked upon Made tears fall from his eyes. 3 O then bespoke his gay lady, As she on a sick-bed lay: ‘Make your will, my lord, Before you go away.’ 4 ‘O there is for my eldest son My houses and my land, And there is for my youngest son Ten thousand pounds in hand. 5 ‘There is for you, my gay lady, My true and lawful wife, The third part of my whole estate, To maintain you a lady's life.’ 6 Then he called to his stable-groom To bring him his gray steed; For he must to London go, The king had sent indeed. 7 When he put his foot in the stirrup, To mount his grey steed, His gold ring from his finger burst, And his nose began to bleed. 8 He had not gone but half a mile When it began to rain; ‘Now this is a token,’ his lordship said, ‘That I shall not return again.’ 9 When he unto London came, A mob did at him rise, And they callëd him a traitor, Made the tears fall from his eyes. 10 ‘A traitor, a traitor!’ his lordship said, Is it for keeping eight score men To fight for pretty Jimmee?’ 11 O then bespoke a grave man, With a broad axe in his hand: ‘Hold your tongue, Lord Derwentwater, Your life lies at my command.’ 12 ‘My life, my life,’ his lordship said, ‘My life I will give to thee, And the black velvet coat upon my back, Take it for thy fee.’ 13 Then he laid his head upon the block, He did such courage show, And asked the executioner To cut it off at one blow. LORD DERWENTWATER—I The Gentleman's Magazine, 1825, vol. xcv, Part First, p. 489, taken down by G. H., apparently in Westmoreland, from the dictation of an old person who had learned it from her father; restored “to something like poetical propriety” by the assistance of “a poetical friend.” 1 King George he did a letter write, And sealed it up with gold, And sent it to Lord Derwentwater, To read it if he could. 2 He sent his letter by no post, He sent it by no page, But sent it by a gallant knight As eer did combat wage. 3 The first line that my lord lookd on Struck him with strong surprise; The second, more alarming still, Made tears fall from his eyes. 4 He called up his stable-groom, Saying, Saddle me well my steed, For I must up to London go, Of me there seems great need. 5 His lady, hearing what he said, As she in child-bed lay, Cry'd, My dear lord, pray make your will Before you go away. 6 ‘I'll leave to thee, my eldest son, My houses and my land; I'll leave to thee, my younger son, Ten thousand pounds in hand. 7 ‘I'll leave to thee, my lady gay, My lawful married wife, A third part of my whole estate, To keep thee a lady's life.’ 8 He knelt him down by her bed-side, And kissed her lips so sweet; The words that passd, alas! presaged They never more should meet. 9 Again he calld his stable-groom, Saying, Bring me out my steed, For I must up to London go, With instant haste and speed. 10 He took the reins into his hand, Which shook with fear and dread; The rings from off his fingers dropt, His nose gushd out and bled. 11 He had but ridden miles two or three When stumbling fell his steed; ‘Ill omens these,’ Derwentwater said, ‘That I for James must bleed.’ 12 As he rode up Westminster street, In sight of the White Hall, The lords and ladies of London town A traitor they did him call. 13 ‘A traitor!’ Lord Derwentwater said, ‘A traitor how can I be, Unless for keeping five hundred men Fighting for King Jemmy?’ 14 Then started forth a grave old man, With a broad-mouthd axe in hand: ‘Thy head, thy head, Lord Derwentwater, Thy head's at my command.’ 15 ‘My head, my head, thou grave old man, My head I will give thee; Here's a coat of velvet on my back Will surely pay thy fee. 16 ‘But give me leave,’ Derwentwater said, ‘To speak words two or three; Ye lords and ladies of London town, Be kind to my lady. 17 ‘Here's a purse of fifty sterling pounds, Pray give it to the poor; Here's one of forty-five beside You may dole from door to door.’ 18 He laid his head upon the block, The axe was sharp and strong, LORD DERWENTWATER—J From “The Old Lady's Collection,” second part, p. 6. 1 The king has written a brod letter, An sealled it our with gould, An sent it to Lord Darnwater, To read it if he could. 2 Whan Lord Darnwater saa the letter, A light laughter lough he; Bat or he read it to an end The tear blinded his eye, An sighan said him good Lord Darnwater, I am near the day to dei. 3 Out spak his lady, In child-bed wher she lay; ‘My d[ea]r Lord Darnweter, what is to becom of me, An my young famely?’ 4 ‘I will leave my young famely As well as I cane; For I will leave to my lady The third part of my land, An I will live to my e[l]dest son, The tua part of my land. 5 ‘An I will live to my eldest daught[er] Five thousand pound of gold, An I will live to my second daughter Three thousand pound of gold. 6 ‘Ye saddel to me my littel gray horse, That I had wont to ried; 7 The first stape Lord Darnwater staped, He stumbled on a ston; Said Lord Darnwater, I feer I ill never come home. 8 When he came to fair London city, An near unt[o] the toun, ‘A trater!

Or wad ye hae his monie? Take a', a' frae him but his sark alone, Leave me my true-love Geordie.’ 12 The captain pu'd her on his knee, An ca'd her heart an honey: ‘An ye wad wait se'en years for me, Ye wad never jump for Geordie.’ 13 ‘O hold your tongue, you foolish man, Your speech it's a' but folly; For an ye wad wait till the day ye die, I wad neer take John for Geordie.’ 14 'Twas up an spak the Lord Corstarph, The ill gae wi his body! ‘O Geordie's neck it war on a block, Gif I had his fair ladie!’ 15 ‘O haud yer tongue, ye foolish man, Yer speech is a' but folly; For if Geordie's neck war on a block, Ye sould neer enjoy his ladie. 16 ‘It's I hae se'en weel gawn mills, I wait they a' gang daily; I'll gie them a' an amang ye a' For the sparin o my Geordie. 17 ‘I hae ele'en bairns i the wast, I wait the're a' to Geordie; I'd see them a' streekit afore mine eyes Afore I lose my Geordie. 18 ‘I hae ele'en bairns i the wast, The twalt bears up my body; The youngest's on his nurse's knee, An he never saw his dadie. 19 ‘I hae se'en uncles in the north, They gang baith proud an lordly; I'd see them a' tread down afore my eyes Afore I lose my Geordie.’ 20 Then out an spak an English lord, The ill gae wi his bodie! ‘It's I gard hang Sir Francie Grey, An I'll soon gar hang your Geordie.’ 21 It's out an spak than a Scottish lord, May the weel gae wi his body! ‘It's I'K cast of my coat an feght Afore ye lose your Geordie.’ 22 It's out then spak an English lord, May the ill gae wi his bodie! ‘Before the morn at ten o'clock, I's hae the head o Geordie.’ 23 Out then spak the Scottish lord, May the weel gae wi his body! ‘I'll fight i bluid up to the knees Afore ye lose your Geordie.’ 24 But out an spak the royal king, May the weel gae wi his body! ‘There's be bluidie heads amang us a' Afore ye lose your Geordie.’ 25 'Twas up than spak the royal queen, ‘May the weel gae wi his body!

For if Geordie's neck had been on the block He had neer enjoyd his ladie. 30 ‘Gar print me ballants weel,’ she said, ‘Gar print me ballants many, Gar print me ballants weel,’ she said, ‘That I am a worthy ladie.’ The Laird of Geight, or Gae; or, The Laird of Geight GEORDIE—C a. “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” Abbotsford, No 38, MS. of Thomas Wilkie, 1813-15, p. 16; taken down from the singing of Miss Christy Robertson, Dunse.

What news hae ye frae Geordie?’ ‘He bids ye sew his linen shirts, For he's sure he'll no need many.’ 3 ‘Go saddle the black, go saddle the brown, Go saddle to me the bonny; For I will neither eat nor drink Until I see my Geordie.’ 4 They've saddled the black, they've saddled the brown, They've saddled her the bonny, And she is away to Edinborough town, Straight away to see her Geordie. 5 When she came to the sea-side, The boats they were nae ready; She turned her horse's head about, And swimd at the Queen's Ferry. 6 And when she came to the prison-door, There poor folks they stood many; She dealt the red guineas them among, And bade them pray weel for Geordie. 7 And when she came into the hall, Amang the nobles many, The napkin's tied on Geordie's face, And the head's to gae frae Geordie. 8 ‘I have born ten bonny sons, And the eleventh neer sa his dadie, And I will bear them all oer again For the life o bonny Geordie. 9 ‘I have born the Laird of Gight, And the Laird of bonny Pernonnie; And I will gie them all to thee For the life of my bonny Geordie.’ 10 Up then spoke [a kind-hearted man], Wha said, He's done good to many; If ye'll tell down ten hundred crowns Away ye shall hae yer Geordie. 11 Some telld shillings, and some telld crowns, But she telld the red guineas many, Till they've telld down ten hundred crowns, And away she's got her Geordie. 12 [It's up then spoke an Irish lord, And O but he spoke bauldly!] ‘I wish his head had been on the block, That I might hae got his fair lady.’ 13 She turned about And O but she spoke boldly! ‘A pox upon your nasty face!

O hold it from my Geordie! For I've got a remit from the king, That I'll get my ain love Geordie.’ 16 When he heard his lady's voice, He was baith blythe and merry: ‘There's many ladies in this place; Have not I a worthy ladie?’ 17 She mounted him on the bonnie dapple grey, Herself on the wee poney, And she rode home on his right hand, All for the pride o Geordie.

Though ye tak the high road and I tak the low, I will be in the Hielans afore ye.’ 2 He hadna been in the high Hielans A month but barely twa, O, Till he was laid in prison strong, For hunting the king's deer and rae, O. 3 ‘O where will I get a bonny, bonny boy, That will run my errand cannie, And gae quickly on to the bonny Bog o Gight, Wi a letter to my lady?’ 4 ‘O here am I, a bonny, bonny boy, That will run your errand cannie, And will gae on to the bonny Bog o Gight, Wi a letter to your lady.’ 5 When she did get this broad letter, A licht, licht laugh gae she, O; But before she read it to an end The saut tear was in her ee, O. 6 ‘O has he robbd? or has he stown? Or has he killëd ony? Or what is the ill that he has done, That he's gaun to be hangd sae shortly?’ 7 ‘He hasna robbd, he hasna stown, He hasna killëd ony; But he has hunted the king's deer and rae, And he will be hangëd shortly.’ 8 ‘Come saddle to me the bonny brown steed, For the black never rade sae bonny, And I will gae on to Edinboro town To borrow the life o my Geordie.’ 9 The first water-side that she cam to, The boatman wasna ready; She gae anither skipper half-a-crown, To boat her oer the ferry. 10 When she cam on to Edinboro town, The poor stood thick and mony; She dealt them money roun and roun, Bade them pray for the life o her Geordie. 11 When she gaed up the tolbooth-stair, She saw there nobles mony, And ilka noble stood hat on head, But hat in hand stood Geordie. 12 Then out it spak an English lord, And vow, but he spake bonny! ‘If ye pay down ten thousand crouns, Ye'll get the life o your Geordie.’ 13 Some gae her marks, some gae her crouns, Some gae her guineas rarely, Till she paid down ten thousand crouns, And she got the life o her Geordie. 14 Then out it spak an Irish lord, O wae befa his body! ‘It's a pity the knicht didna lose his head, That I micht hae gotten his lady.’ 15 But out it spak the lady hersel, And vow, but she spak bonny! ‘The pock-marks are on your Irish face, You could not compare wi my Geordie!’ 16 When she was in the saddle set, And on ahint her Geordie, The bird on the bush neer sang sae sweet, As she sung to her love Geordie. 17 ‘First I was mistress o bonny Auchindown, And I was lady o a' Carnie, But now I have come to the bonny Bog o Gight, The wife o my true-love Geordie. 18 ‘If I were in the high Hielans, I would hear the white kye lowing; But I'd rather be on the bonny banks o Spey, To see the fish-boaties rowing.’ Gight's Lady; or, Laird (Lord?) of Gight GEORDIE—I a. Buchan's MSS, II, 143. b. Kinloch MSS, VI, 1, in the handwriting of Joseph Robertson. 1 ‘I choosed my love at the bonny yates of Gight, Where the birks an the flowers spring bony, But pleasures I had never one, But crosses very mony. 2 ‘First I was mistress of Pitfan And madam of Kincraigie, And now my name is bonny Lady Anne, And I am Gight's own lady. 3 ‘He does not use me as his wife, Nor cherish me as his lady, But day by day he saddles the grey, And rides off to Bignet's lady.’ 4 Bignet he got word of this, That Gight lay wi his lady; He swore a vow, and kept it true, To be revengd on's body. 5 ‘Where will I get a bonny boy Will run my errand shortly, That woud run on to the bonny yates o Gight Wi a letter to my lady?’ 6 Gight has written a broad letter, And seald it soon and ready, And sent it on to Gight's own yates, For to acquaint his lady. 7 The first of it she looked on, O dear! she smiled bonny; But as she read it till an end The tears were thick an mony. 8 ‘Come saddle to me the black,’ she says, ‘Come saddle him soon and shortly, Ere I ride down to Edinburgh town, Wi a lang side sark to Geordy.’ 9 When she came to the boat of Leith, I wad she did na tarry; She gave the boatman a guinea o gold To boat her oer the ferry. 10 As she gaed oer the pier of Leith, Among the peerls many, She dealt the crowns and dukedoons, Bade them a' pray for Geordy. 11 As she gaed up the tolbooth-stair, Among the nobles many, Every one sat hat on head, But hat in hand stood Geordy. 12 ‘Has he brunt? or has he slain? Or has he robbëd any? Or has he done any other crime, That gars you head my Geordy?’ 13 ‘He hasna brunt, he hasna slain, He hasna robbed any; But he has done another crime, For which he will pay dearly.’ 14 In it comes him First Lord Judge, Says, George, I'm sorry for you; You must prepare yourself for death, For there'll be nae mercy for you. 15 In it comes him Second Lord Judge, Says, George I'm sorry for you; You must prepare yourself for death, For there'll be nae mercy for you. 16 Out it speaks Gight's lady herself, And vow, but she spake wordy! ‘Is there not a lord among you all Can plead a word for Geordy?’ 17 Out it speaks the first Lord Judge: ‘What lady's that amang you That speaks to us so boldly here, And bids us plead for Geordy?’ 18 Out then spake a friend, her own, And says, It's Gight's own lady, Who is come to plead her own lord's cause, To which she's true and steady. 19 The queen, looking oer her shott-window, Says, Ann, I'm sorry for you; If ye'll tell down ten thousand crowns, Ye shall get home your Geordy. 20 She's taen the hat out of his hand, And dear! it set her bonny; She's beggd the red gold them among, And a' to borrow Geordy. 21 She turnd her right and round about Among the nobles many; Some gave her dollars, some her crowns, And some gave guineas many. 22 She spread her mantle on the floor, O dear! she spread it bonny, And she told down that noble sum; Says, Put on your hat, my Geordy. 23 But out it speaks him gleid Argyle, Says, Woe be to your body! I wish that Gight had lost his head, I should enjoyd his lady. 24 She looked oer her left shoulder, A proud look and a saucy; Says, Woe be to you, gleid Argyle! Ye'll neer be like my Geordy. 25 ‘You'll hae me to some writer's house, And that baith seen and shortly, That I may write down Gight's lament, And how I borrowed Geordy.’ 26 When she was in her saddle set, And aye behind her Geordy, Birds neer sang blyther in the bush Than she behind her Geordy. 27 ‘O bonny George, but I love thee well, And O sae dear as I love thee! The sun and moon and firmament above Bear witness how I love thee!’ 28 ‘O bonny Ann, but I love thee well, And O but sae dear as I love thee! The birds in the air, that fly together pair and pair, Bear witness, Ann, that I love thee!’ Gight's Lady GEORDIE—J Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 133. 1 ‘First I was lady o Black Riggs, And then into Kincraigie; Now I am the Lady o Gight, And my love he's ca'd Geordie. 2 ‘I was the mistress o Pitfan, And madam o Kincraigie; But now my name is Lady Anne, And I am Gight's own lady. 3 ‘We courted in the woods o Gight, Where birks and flowrs spring bonny; But pleasures I had never one, But sorrows thick and mony. 4 ‘He never ownd me as his wife, Nor honourd me as his lady, But day by day he saddles the grey, And rides to Bignet's lady.’ 5 When Bignet he got word of that, That Gight lay wi his lady, He's casten him in prison strong, To ly till lords were ready. 6 ‘Where will I get a little wee boy, That is baith true and steady, That will run on to bonny Gight, And bring to me my lady?’ 7 ‘O here am I, a little wee boy, That is baith true and steady, That will run to the yates o Gight, And bring to you your lady.’ 8 ‘Ye'll bid her saddle the grey, the grey, The brown rode neer so smartly; Ye'll bid her come to Edinbro town, A' for the life of Geordie.’ 9 The night was fair, the moon was clear, And he rode by Bevany, And stopped at the yates o Gight, Where leaves were thick and mony. 10 The lady lookd oer castle-wa, And dear, but she was sorry! ‘Here comes a page frae Edinbro town; A' is nae well wi Geordie. 11 ‘What news, what news, my little boy? Come tell me soon and shortly;’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my lady,’ he said, ‘They're going to hang your Geordie.’ 12 ‘Ye'll saddle to me the grey, the grey, The brown rade neer so smartly; And I'll awa to Edinbro town, Borrow the life o Geordie.’ 13 When she came near to Edinbro town, I wyte she didna tarry, But she has mounted her grey steed, And ridden the Queen's Ferry. 14 When she came to the boat of Leith, I wat she didna tarry; She gae the boatman a guinea o gowd To boat her ower the ferry. 15 When she came to the pier o Leith, The poor they were sae many; She dealt the gowd right liberallie, And bade them pray for Geordie. 16 When she gaed up the tolbooth-stair, The nobles there were many: And ilka ane stood hat on head, But hat in hand stood Geordie. 17 She gae a blink out-ower them a', And three blinks to her Geordie; But when she saw his een fast bound, A swoon fell in this lady. 18 ‘Whom has he robbd? What has he stole? Or has he killed ony? Or what's the crime that he has done, His foes they are sae mony?’ 19 ‘He hasna brunt, he hasna slain, He hasna robbed ony; But he has done another crime, For which he will pay dearly.’ 20 Then out it speaks Lord Montague, O wae be to his body! ‘The day we hangd young Charles Hay, The morn we'll head your Geordie.’ 21 Then out it speaks the king himsell, Vow, but he spake bonny! ‘Come here, young Gight, confess your sins, Let's hear if they be mony. 22 ‘Come here, young Gight, confess your sins, See ye be true and steady; And if your sins they be but sma, Then ye'se win wi your lady.’ 23 ‘Nane have I robbd, nought have I stown, Nor have I killed ony; But ane o the king's best brave steeds, I sold him in Bevany.’ 24 Then out it speaks the king again, Dear, but he spake bonny! ‘That crime's nae great; for your lady's sake, Put on your hat now, Geordie.’ 25 Then out it speaks Lord Montague, O wae be to his body! ‘There's guilt appears in Gight's ain face, Ye'll cross-examine Geordie.’ 26 ‘Now since it all I must confess, My crimes' baith great and mony: A woman abused, five orphan babes, I killd them for their money.’ 27 Out it speaks the king again, And dear, but he was sorry! ‘Your confession brings confusion, Take aff your hat now, Geordie.’ 28 Then out it speaks the lady hersell, Vow, but she was sorry! ‘Now all my life I'll wear the black, Mourn for the death o Geordie.’ 29 Lord Huntly then he did speak out, O fair mot fa his body! ‘I there will fight doublet alane Or ony thing ails Geordie.’ 30 Then out it speaks the king again, Vow, but he spake bonny! ‘If ye'll tell down ten thousand crowns, Ye'll buy the life o Geordie.’ 31 She spread her mantle on the ground, Dear, but she spread it bonny! Some gae her crowns, some ducadoons, And some gae dollars mony: Then she tauld down ten thousand crowns, ‘Put on your hat, my Geordie.’ 32 Then out it speaks Lord Montague, Wae be to his body! ‘I wisht that Gight wanted the head; I might enjoyd his lady.’ 33 Out it speaks the lady hersell, ‘Ye need neer wish my body; O ill befa your wizzend snout! Woud ye compare wi Geordie?’ 34 When she was in her saddle set, Riding the leys sae bonny, The fiddle and fleet playd neer sae sweet As she behind her Geordie. 35 ‘O Geordie, Geordie, I love you well, Nae jealousie coud move me; The birds in air, that fly in pairs, Can witness how I love you. 36 ‘Ye'll call for one, the best o clerks, Ye'll call him soon and shortly, As he may write what I indite, A' this I've done for Geordie.’ 37 He turned him right and round about, And high, high looked Geordie: ‘A finger o Bignet's lady's hand Is worth a' your fair body.’ 38 ‘My lands may a' be masterless, My babes may want their mother; But I've made a vow, will keep it true, I'll be bound to no other.’ 39 These words they causd a great dispute, And proud and fierce grew Geordie; A sharp dagger he pulled out, And pierced the heart o's lady. 40 The lady's dead, and Gight he's fled, And left his lands behind him; Altho they searched south and north, There were nane there coud find him. 41 Now a' that lived into Black Riggs, And likewise in Kincraigie, For seven years were clad in black, To mourn for Gight's own lady.

Shall I venture my body in field to fight With a man that's faith and troth to me?’ 15 ‘What's that thou sayst, thou limmer loon? Or how dare thou stand to speak to me? If thou do not end this quarrel soon, Here is my glove thou shalt fight me.’ 16 Christy stoopd low unto the ground, Unto the ground, as you'll understand: ‘O father, put on your glove again, The wind hath blown it from your hand.’ 17 ‘What's that thou sayst, thou limmer loon? Or how dare thou stand to speak to me? If thou do not end this quarrel soon, Here is my hand thou shalt fight me.’ 18 Christy Grahame is to his chamber gone, And for to study, as well might be, Whether to fight with his father dear, Or with his bully Bewick he. 19 ‘If it be [my] fortune my bully to kill, As you shall boldly understand, In every town that I ride through, They'll say, There rides a brotherless man! 20 ‘Nay, for to kill my bully dear, I think it will be a deadly sin; And for to kill my father dear, The blessing of heaven I neer shall win. 21 ‘O give me your blessing, father,’ he said, ‘And pray well for me for to thrive; If it be my fortune my bully to kill, I swear I'll neer come home alive.’ 22 He put on his back a good plate-jack, And on his head a cap of steel, With sword and buckler by his side; O gin he did not become them well! 23 ‘O fare thee well, my father dear! And fare thee well, thou Carlisle town! If it be my fortune my bully to kill, I swear I'll neer eat bread again.’ 24 Now we'll leave talking of Christy Grahame, And talk of him again belive; But we will talk of bonny Bewick, Where he was teaching his scholars five. 25 Now when he had learnd them well to fence, To handle their swords without any doubt, He's taken his own sword under his arm, And walkd his father's close about. 26 He lookd between him and the sun, To see what farleys he coud see; There he spy'd a man with armour on, As he came riding over the lee. 27 ‘I wonder much what man yon be That so boldly this way does come; I think it is my nighest friend, I think it is my bully Grahame. 28 ‘O welcome, O welcome, bully Grahame! O man, thou art my dear, welcome! O man, thou art my dear, welcome! For I love thee best in Christendom.’ 29 ‘Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of thy bullyship let me be! The day is come I never thought on; Bully, I'm come here to fight with thee.’ 30 ‘O no! not so, O bully Grahame! That eer such a word should spoken be! I was thy master, thou was my scholar: So well as I have learnëd thee.’ 31 ‘My father he was in Carlisle town, Where thy father Bewick there met he; He said I was bad, and he calld me a lad, And a baffled man by thou I be.’ 32 ‘Away, away, O bully Grahame, And of all that talk, man, let us be! We'll take three men of either side To see if we can our fathers agree.’ 33 ‘Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of thy bullyship let me be! But if thou be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with me.’ 34 ‘O no! not so, my bully Grahame! That eer such a word should spoken be! Shall I venture my body in field to fight With a man that's faith and troth to me?’ 35 ‘Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of all that care, man, let us be! If thou be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with me.’ 36 ‘Now, if it be my fortune thee, Grahame, to kill, As God's will's, man, it all must be; But if it be my fortune thee, Grahame, to kill, 'Tis home again I'll never gae.’ 37 ‘Thou art of my mind then, bully Bewick, And sworn-brethren will we be; If thou be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with me.’ 38 He flang his cloak from [off] his shoulders, His psalm-book out of his hand flang he, He clapd his hand upon the hedge, And oer lap he right wantonly. 39 When Grahame did see his bully come, The salt tear stood long in his eye: ‘Now needs must I say that thou art a man, That dare venture thy body to fight with me. 40 ‘Now I have a harness on my back; I know that thou hath none on thine; But as little as thou hath on thy back, Sure as little shall there be on mine.’ 41 He flang his jack from off his back, His steel cap from his head flang he; He's taken his sword into his hand, He's tyed his horse unto a tree. 42 Now they fell to it with two broa[d swords], For two long hours fought Bewick [and he]; Much sweat was to be seen on them both, But never a drop of blood to see. 43 Now Grahame gave Bewick an ackward stroke, An ackward stroke surely struck he; He struck him now under the left breast, Then down to the ground as dead fell he. 44 ‘Arise, arise, O bully Bewick, Arise, and speak three words to me! Whether this be thy deadly wound, Or God and good surgeons will mend thee.’ 45 ‘O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And pray do get thee far from me! Thy sword is sharp, it hath wounded my heart, And so no further can I gae. 46 ‘O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And get thee far from me with speed! And get thee out of this country quite! That none may know who's done the deed.’ 47 ‘O if this be true, my bully dear, The words that thou dost tell to me, The vow I made, and the vow I'll keep; I swear I'll be the first that die. 48 Then he stuck his sword in a moody-hill, Where he lap thirty good foot and three; First he bequeathed his soul to God, And upon his own sword-point lap he. 49 Now Grahame he was the first that died, And then came Robin Bewick to see; ‘Arise, arise, O son!’ he said, ‘For I see thou's won the victory. 50 ‘Arise, arise, O son!’ he said, ‘For I see thou's won the victory:’ ‘[Father, co]uld ye not drunk your wine at home, [And le]tten me and my brother be? 51 ‘Nay, dig a grave both low and wide, And in it us two pray bury; But bury my bully Grahame on the sun-side, For I'm sure he's won the victory.’ 52 Now we'll leave talking of these two brethren, In Carlisle town where they lie slain, And talk of these two good old men, Where they were making a pitiful moan. 53 With that bespoke now Robin Bewick: ‘O man, was I not much to blame? I have lost one of the liveliest lads That ever was bred unto my name.’ 54 With that bespoke my good lord Grahame: ‘O man, I have lost the better block; I have lost my comfort and my joy, I have lost my key, I have lost my lock. 55 ‘Had I gone through all Ladderdale, And forty horse had set on me, Had Christy Grahame been at my back, So well as he woud guarded me.’ 56 I have no more of my song to sing, But two or three words to you I'll name; But't will be talk'd in Carlisle town That these two [old] men were all the blame. 212 THE DUKE OF ATHOLE'S NURSE THE DUKE OF ATHOLE'S NURSE—A Cromek's Select Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 196, 194; sent, with other fragments, by Robert Burns to William Tytler, August, 1790; stanzas 2-6. 1 ‘Where shall I gang, my ain true love? Where shall I gang to hide me? For weel ye ken i yere father's bowr It wad be death to find me.’ 2 ‘O go you to yon tavern-house, An there count owre your lawin, An, if I be a woman true, I'll meet you in the dawin.’ 3 O he's gone to yon tavern-house, An ay he counted his lawin, An ay he drank to her guid health Was to meet him in the dawin. 4 O he's gone to yon tavern-house, An counted owre his lawin, When in there cam three armed men, To meet him in the dawin. 5 ‘O woe be unto woman's wit! It has beguiled many; She promised to come hersel, But she sent three men to slay me.’ THE DUKE OF ATHOLE'S NURSE—B Skene MS., p. 10; taken down in the north of Scotland, 1802-3. 1 ‘Ye are the Duke of Athol's nurse, And I'm the new-come darling; I'll gie you my gay gold rings To get ae word of my leman.’ 2 ‘I am the Duke of Athol's nurse, And ye're the new-come darling; Keep well your gay gold rings, Ye sall get twa words o your leman.’ 3 He leand oure his saddle-bow, It was not for to kiss her: ‘Anither woman has my heart, And I but come here to see ye.’ 4 ‘If anither woman has your heart, O dear, but I am sorry! Ye hie you down to yon ale house, And stay untill't be dawing, And if I be a woman true I'll meet you in the dawing.’ 5 He did him down to yon ale-house, And drank untill't was dawing; He drank the bonnie lassie's health That was to clear his lawing. 6 He lookit out of a shot-window, To see if she was coming, And there he seed her seven brithers, So fast as they were running! 7 He went up and down the house, Says, ‘Landlady, can you save me? For yonder comes her seven brithers, And they are coming to slay me.’ 8 So quick she minded her on a wile How she might protect him! She dressd him in a suit of woman's attire And set him to her baking. 9 ‘Had you a quarterer here last night, Or staid he to the dawing? Shew us the room the squire lay in, We are come to clear his lawing.’ 10 ‘I had a quarterer here last night, But he staid not to the dawing; He called for a pint, and paid as he went, You have nothing to do with his lawing.’ 11 They searchd the house baith up and down, The curtains they spaird not to rive em, And twenty times they passd The squire at his baking. Duke of Athole's Gates THE DUKE OF ATHOLE'S NURSE—C Kinloch MSS, I, 335. 1 As I went down by the Duke of Athole's gates, Where the bells of the court were ringing, And there I heard a fair maid say, O if I had but ae sight o my Johnie! 2 ‘O here is your Johnie just by your side; What have ye to say to your Johnie? O here is my hand, but anither has my heart, So ye'll never get more o your Johnie.’ 3 ‘O ye may go down to yon ale-house, And there do sit till the dawing; And call for the wine that is very, very fine, And I'll come and clear up your lawing.’ 4 So he's gane down to yon ale-house, And he has sat till the dawing; And he's calld for the wine that's very, very fine, But she neer cam to clear up his lawing. 5 Lang or the dawing he oure the window looks, To see if his true-love was coming, And there he spied twelve weel armd boys, Coming over the plainstanes running. 6 ‘O landlady, landlady, what shall I do? For my life it's not worth a farthing!’ ‘O young man,’ said she, ‘tak counsel by me, And I will be your undertaking. 7 ‘I will clothe you in my own body-clothes And I'll send you like a girl to the baking:’ And loudly, loudly they rapped at the door, And loudly, loudly they rappëd. 8 ‘O had you any strangers here late last night? Or were they lang gane or the dawing? O had you any strangers here late last night? We are now come to clear up his lawing.’ 9 ‘O I had a stranger here late last night, But he was lang gane or the dawing; He called for a pint, and he paid it as he went, And ye've no more to do with his lawing.’ 10 ‘O show me the room that your stranger lay in, If he was lang gane or the dawing:’ She showed them the room that her stranger lay in, But he was lang gane or the dawing. 11 O they stabbed the feather-bed all round and round, And the curtains they neer stood to tear them; And they gade as they cam, and left a' things undone, And left the young squire by his baking. Duke of Athole's Nurse THE DUKE OF ATHOLE'S NURSE—D Kinloch MSS, I, 337. 1 As I cam in by the Duke of Athole's gate, I heard a fair maid singing, Wi a bonny baby on her knee, And the bells o the court were ringing. 2 ‘O it's I am the Duke of Athole's nurse, And the place does well become me; But I would gie a' my half-year's fee Just for a sight o my Johnie. 3 ‘If ye'll gae down to yon ale-house, And stop till it be dawing, And ca for a pint o the very, very best, And I'll come and clear up your lawing.’ 4 O he's gane down to yon ale-house, And stopt till it was dawing; He ca'd for a pint o the very, very best, But she cam na to clear up his lawing. 5 He looked out at the chamber-window, To see if she was coming; And there he spied ten armed men, Across the plain coming running. 6 ‘O landlady, landlady, what shall I do? For my life is not worth a farthing; I paid you a guinea for my lodging last night, But I fear I'll never see sun shining.’ 7 ‘If ye will be advised by me, I'll be your undertaking; I'll dress you up in my ain body-clothes And set you to the baking.’ 8 So loudly at the door they rapt, So loudly are they calling, ‘O had you a stranger here last night, Or is he within your dwalling?’ 9 ‘O I had a stranger here last night, But he wos gane or dawing; He ca'd for a pint, and he paid it or he went, And I hae nae mair to do wi his lawing.’ 10 They stabd the feather-beds round and round, The curtains they spared na to tear them; But they went as they came, and left a' things undone, And the young man busy baking.

Or where shall I gang hide me? She that was to meet me in friendship this day Has sent nine men to slay me!’ 13 He's gane to the landlady o the house, Says, ‘O can you supply me? For she that was to meet me in friendship this day Has sent nine men to slay me.’ 14 She gae him a suit o her ain female claise And set him to the baking; The bird never sang mair sweet on the bush Nor the knight sung at the baking. 15 As they came in at the ha-door, Sae loudly as they rappit! And when they came upon the floor, Sae loudly as they chappit! 16 ‘O had ye a stranger here last night, Who drank till the day was dawing? Come show us the chamber where he lyes in, We'll shortly clear his lawing.’ 17 ‘I had nae stranger here last night That drank till the day was dawing; But ane that took a pint, and paid it ere he went, And there's naething to clear o his lawing.’ 18 A lad amang the rest, being o a merry mood, To the young knight fell a-talking; The wife took her foot and gae him a kick, Says, Be busy, ye jilt, at your baking. 19 They stabbed the house baith but and ben, The curtains they spared nae riving, And for a' that they did search and ca, For a kiss o the knight they were striving. 213 SIR JAMES THE ROSE Sir James the Rose SIR JAMES THE ROSE a.

For he has killd a gallant squire, An's friends are out to take him. 2 Now he's gone to the House of Marr, Where the nourrice was his leman; To see his dear he did repair, Thinking she would befriend him. 3 ‘Where are you going, Sir James?’ she says, ‘Or where now are you riding?’ ‘O I am bound to a foreign land, For now I'm under hiding. 4 ‘Where shall I go? Where shall I run? Where shall I go to hide me? For I have killd a gallant squire, And they're seeking to slay me.’ 5 ‘O go ye down to yon ale-house, And I'll pay there your lawing; And, if I be a woman true, I'll meet you in the dawing.’ 6 ‘I'll not go down to yon ale-house, For you to pay my lawing; There's forty shillings for one supper, I'll stay in't till the dawing.’ 7 He's turnd him right and round about And rowd him in his brechan, And he has gone to take a sleep, In the lowlands of Buleighen. 8 He was not well gone out of sight, Nor was he past Milstrethen, Till four and twenty belted knights Came riding oer the Leathen. 9 ‘O have you seen Sir James the Rose, The young heir of Buleighen? For he has killd a gallant squire, And we're sent out to take him.’ 10 ‘O I have seen Sir James,’ she says, ‘For he past here on Monday; If the steed be swift that he rides on, He's past the gates of London.’ 11 But as they were going away, Then she calld out behind them; ‘If you do seek Sir James,’ she says, ‘I'll tell you where you'll find him. 12 ‘You'll seek the bank above the mill, In the lowlands of Buleighen, And there you'll find Sir James the Rose, Lying sleeping in his brechan. 13 ‘You must not wake him out of sleep, Nor yet must you affright him, Till you run a dart quite thro his heart, And thro the body pierce him.’ 14 They sought the bank above the mill, In the lowlands of Buleighan, And there they found Sir James the Rose, A sleeping in his brechan. 15 Then out bespoke Sir John the Græme, Who had the charge a keeping; ‘It's neer be said, dear gentlemen, We'll kill him when he's sleeping.’ 16 They seizd his broadsword and his targe, And closely him surrounded; But when he wak'd out of his sleep, His senses were confounded. 17 ‘O pardon, pardon, gentlemen! Have mercy now upon me!’ ‘Such as you gave, such you shall have, And so we'll fall upon thee.’ 18 ‘Donald my man, wait me upon, And I'll give you my brechan, And, if you stay here till I die, You'll get my trews of tartan. 19 ‘There is fifty pounds in my pocket, Besides my trews and brechan; You'll get my watch and diamond ring; And take me to Loch Largon.’ 20 Now they have taken out his heart And stuck it on a spear, Then took it to the House of Marr, And gave it to his dear. 21 But when she saw his bleeding heart She was like one distracted; She smote her breast, and wrung her hands, Crying, ‘What now have I acted! 22 ‘Sir James the Rose, now for thy sake O but my heart's a breaking! Curst be the day I did thee betray, Thou brave knight of Buleighen.’ 23 Then up she rose, and forth she goes, All in that fatal hour, And bodily was born away, And never was seen more. 24 But where she went was never kend, And so, to end the matter, A traitor's end, you may depend, Can be expect'd no better. 214 THE BRAES O YARROW The Braes of Yarrow THE BRAES O YARROW—A Communicated to Percy by Dr William Robertson, Principal of Edinburgh. 1 ‘I dreamed a dreary dream this night, That fills my heart wi sorrow; I dreamed I was pouing the heather green Upon the braes of Yarrow. 2 ‘O true-luve mine, stay still and dine, As ye ha done before, O;’ ‘O I'll be hame by hours nine, And frae the braes of Yarrow.’ 3 I dreamed a dreary dream this night, That fills my heart wi sorrow; I dreamed my luve came headless hame, O frae the braes of Yarrow! 4 ‘O true-luve mine, stay still and dine, As ye ha done before, O;’ ‘O I'll be hame by hours nine, And frae the braes of Yarrow.’ 5 ‘O are ye going to hawke,’ she says, ‘As ye ha done before, O? Or are ye going to weild your brand, Upon the braes of Yarrow?’ 6 ‘O I am not going to hawke,’ he says, ‘As I have done before, O, But for to meet your brother Jhon, Upon the braes of Yarrow.’ 7 As he gade down yon dowy den, Sorrow went him before, O; Nine well-wight men lay waiting him, Upon the braes of Yarrow. 8 ‘I have your sister to my wife, ‘Ye’ think me an unmeet marrow; But yet one foot will I never flee Now frae the braes of Yarrow.’ 9 ‘Than’ four he killd and five did wound, That was an unmeet marrow! ‘And he had weel nigh wan the day Upon the braes of Yarrow.’ 10 ‘Bot’ a cowardly ‘loon’ came him behind, Our Lady lend him sorrow! And wi a rappier pierced his heart, And laid him low on Yarrow. 11 ‘Now Douglas’ to his sister's gane, Wi meikle dule and sorrow: ‘Gae to your luve, sister,’ he says, ‘He's sleeping sound on Yarrow.’ 12 As she went down yon dowy den, Sorrow went her before, O; She saw her true-love lying slain Upon the braes of Yarrow. 13 ‘She swoond thrice upon his breist That was her dearest marrow; Said, Ever alace and wae the day Thou wentst frae me to Yarrow!’ 14 She kist his mouth, she kaimed his hair, As she had done before, O; She ‘wiped’ the blood that trickled doun Upon the braes of Yarrow. 15 Her hair it was three quarters lang, It hang baith side and yellow; She tied it round ‘her’ white hause-bane, ‘And tint her life on Yarrow.’ The Braes o Yarrow THE BRAES O YARROW—B Murison MS., p. 105; Old Deer, Aberdeenshire. 1 Three lords sat drinking at the wine I the bonny braes o Yarrow, An there cam a dispute them between, Who was the Flower o Yarrow. 2 ‘I'm wedded to your sister dear, Ye coont nae me your marrow; I stole her fae her father's back, An made her the Flower o Yarrow.’ 3 ‘Will ye try hearts, or will ye try hans, I the bonnie braes o Yarrow?

The Dowie Downs o Yarrow THE BRAES O YARROW—C Motherwell's MS., pp. 334, 331, from the recitation of Agnes Lile, Kilbarchan, July 19, 1825; learned from her father, who died fourteen years earlier, at the age of eighty. 1 There were three lords birling at the wine On the dowie downs o Yarrow; They made a compact them between They would go fight tomorrow. 2 ‘Thou took our sister to be thy bride, And thou neer thocht her thy marrow; Thou stealed her frae her daddie's back, When she was the rose o Yarrow.’ 3 ‘Yes, I took your sister to be my bride, And I made her my marrow; I stealed her frae her daddie's back, And she's still the rose o Yarrow.’ 4 He is hame to his lady gane, As he had dune before! O; Says, Madam, I must go and fight On the dowie downs o Yarrow. 5 ‘Stay at hame, my lord,’ she said, ‘For that will cause much sorrow; For my brethren three they will slay thee, On the dowie downs o Yarrow.’ 6 ‘Hold your tongue, my lady fair, For what needs a' this sorrow? For I'll be hame gin the clock strikes nine, From the dowie downs o Yarrow.’ 7 She wush his face, she kamed his hair, As she had dune before, O; She dressed him up in his armour clear, Sent him furth to fight on Yarrow. 8 ‘Come you here to hawk or hound, Or drink the wine that's so clear, O? Or come you here to eat in your words, That you're not the rose o Yarrow?’ 9 ‘I came not here to hawk or hound, Nor to drink the wine that's so clear, O; Nor I came not here to eat in my words, For I'm still the rose o Yarrow.’ 10 Then they a' begoud to fight, I wad they focht richt sore, O, Till a cowardly man came behind his back, And pierced his body thorough. 11 ‘Gae hame, gae hame, it's my man John, As ye have done before, O, And tell it to my gay lady That I soundly sleep on Yarrow.’ 12 His man John he has gane hame, As he had dune before, O, And told it to his gay lady, That he soundly slept on Yarrow. 13 ‘I dreamd a dream now since the streen, God keep us a' frae sorrow! That my lord and I was pu'ing the heather green From the dowie downs o Yarrow.’ 14 Sometimes she rade, sometimes she gaed, As she had dune before, O, And aye between she fell in a soune, Lang or she cam to Yarrow. 15 Her hair it was five quarters lang, 'Twas like the gold for yellow; She twisted it round his milk-white hand, And she's drawn him hame from Yarrow. 16 Out and spak her father dear, Says, What needs a' this sorrow? For I'll get you a far better lord Than ever died on Yarrow. 17 ‘O hold your tongue, father,’ she said, ‘For ye've bred a' my sorrow; For that rose'll neer spring sae sweet in May As that rose I lost on Yarrow.’ The Bonny Braes of Yarrow THE BRAES O YARROW—D Communicated to Percy by Robert Lambe, Norham, April 16, 1768. 1 There were three lords drinking of wine On the bonny braes of Yarrow; There fell a combat them between, Wha was the rose of Yarrow. 2 Up then spak a noble lord, And I wot it was bot sorrow: ‘I have as fair a flower,’ he said, ‘As ever sprang on Yarrow.’ 3 Then he went hame to his ain house, For to sleep or the morrow, But the first sound the trumpet gae Was, Mount and haste to Yarrow. 4 ‘Oh stay at hame,’ his lady said, ‘Oh stay untill the morrow, And I will mount upon a steed, And ride with you to Yarrow.’ 5 ‘Oh hawd your tongue, my dear,’ said he, ‘And talk not of the morrow; This day I have to fight again, In the dowy deans of Yarrow.’ 6 As he went up yon high, high hill, Down the dowy deans of Yarrow, There he spy'd ten weel armd men, There was nane o them his marrow. 7 Five he wounded and five he slew, In the dowy deans of Yarrow, But an English-man out of a bush Shot at him a lang sharp arrow. 8 ‘Ye may gang hame, my brethren three, Ye may gang hame with sorrow, And say this to my fair lady, I am sleeping sound on Yarrow.’ 9 ‘Sister, sister, I dreamt a dream— You read a dream to gude, O! That I was puing the heather green On the bonny braes of Yarrow.’ 10 ‘Sister, sister, I'll read your dream, But alas! it's unto sorrow; Your good lord is sleeping sound, He is lying dead on Yarrow.’ 11 She as pu'd the ribbons of her head, And I wot it was wi sorrow, And she's gane up yon high, high hill, Down the dowy deans of Yarrow. 12 Her hair it was five quarters lang, The colour of it was yellow; She as ty'd it round his middle jimp, And she as carried him frae Yarrow. 13 ‘O hawd your tongue!’ her father says, ‘What needs a' this grief and sorrow?

For my love I had him chosen. 16 His hair it was three quarters long, Three quarters long and yellow; And she's rapt it round her middle small, And brought it home to Thorro. 17 ‘O hold your tongue, my daughter dear, And talk no more of sorrow; I'll soon wed you on a better match Than your servant-lad in Galla.’ 18 ‘O you may wed a' your seven sons, I wish you may wed them in sorrow: O you may wed a' your seven sons, For you'll neer wed the bonny lass of Thoro.’ 19 This lady being big wi child, And her heart was full wi sorrow, She died between her father's arms, In the bonny house of Thorro. The Dowie Den in Yarrow THE BRAES O YARROW—K Campbell MS., I, 8; “communicated by Janet Ormstone, Innerleithen, who sung it to a beautiful old air.” 1 There lived a lady in the south, She thought she had not her marrow; And she was courted by nine gentlemen, In the dowie dens in Yarrow. 2 All their offers they proved in vain, She thought that they were not her marrow; She has forsaken a' the nine, Loved a servant-lad on Galla. 3 Up bespoke her father dear, Who bred them a' this sorrow; You must go far, far to fight the nine, In the dowie den in Yarrow.’ 4 She washd his face, she combd his hair, Her heart being full of sorrow, With a rusted rapier down by his side, To fight his foes in Yarrow. 5 He's ridden east, he's ridden west, He's ridden into Yarrow, And there he espied all the nine, Watering their steeds in Yarrow. 6 ‘Ye'r welcome, welcome, young man,’ they said, ‘But I think ye are not our marrow;’ ‘But I'll fight ye all out, one by one, In the dowie dens o Yarrow.’ 7 Four he has wounded, five he has slain, He left them a' sound in Yarrow; He turned him round with rejoyfull looks, Says, I wone the lady of Thoro. 8 Up then spoke her father dear, Who bred them a' this sorrow; He's taen out a broadsword and run him through, In the dowie dens o Yarrow. 9 ‘I dreamed a dream last night,’ she says, ‘I fear it is for sorrow; I dreamd I was pulling the heather green With my true love in Yarrow.’ 10 ‘I'll read your dream now, daughter dear, I fear it is for sorrow; You will find your true-love lying sound, In a heather bush in Yarrow.’ 11 She's ridden east, she's ridden west, She's ridden into Yarrow; There she found her true lover sound, In a heather bush in Yarrow. 12 His hair it was five quarters lang, It was baith lang and yellow; She's tied it to her horse's mane, She's trailed him home from Yarrow. 13 ‘O woe be to you, father dear! You've bred me all this sorrow;’ So she died between her father's arms, In the dowie dens o Yarrow. The Dowie Dens THE BRAES O YARROW—L Blackwood's Magazine, CXLVII, 741, June, 1890; communicated by Professor John Veitch, as received from William Welsh, a Peeblesshire cottar and poet, born 1799, whose mother used to recite the ballad, and whose grandmother had a copy in her father's handwriting. 1 At Dryhope lived a lady fair, The fairest flower in Yarrow, And she refused nine noble men For a servan lad in Gala. 2 Her father said that he should fight The nine lords all to-morrow, And he that should the victor be Would get the Rose of Yarrow. 3 Quoth he, You're nine, an I'm but ane, And in that there's no much marrow; Yet I shall fecht ye, man for man, In the dowie dens o Yarrow. 4 She kissed his lips, and combed his hair, As oft she'd done before, O, An set him on her milk-white steed, Which bore him on to Yarrow. 5 When he got oer yon high, high hill, An down the dens o Yarrow, There did he see the nine lords all, But there was not one his marrow. 6 ‘Now here ye're nine, an I'm but ane, But yet I am not sorrow; For here I'll fecht ye, man for man, For my true love in Yarrow.’ 7 Then he wheeld round, and fought so fierce Till the seventh fell in Yarrow, When her brother sprang from a bush behind, And ran his body thorough. 8 He never spoke more words than these, An they were words o sorrow; ‘Ye may tell my true love, if ye please, That I'm sleepin sound in Yarrow.’ 9 They've taen the young man by the heels And trailed him like a harrow, And then they flung the comely youth In a whirlpool o Yarrow. 10 The lady said, I dreamed yestreen— I fear it bodes some sorrow— That I was pu'in the heather green On the scroggy braes o Yarrow.’ 11 Her brother said, I'll read your dream, But it should cause nae sorrow; Ye may go seek your lover hame, For he's sleepin sound in Yarrow. 12 Then she rode oer yon gloomy height, An her heart was fu o sorrow, But only saw the clud o night, Or heard the roar o Yarrow. 13 But she wandered east, so did she wast, And searched the forest thorough, Until she spied her ain true love, Lyin deeply drowned in Yarrow. 14 His hair it was five quarters lang, Its colour was the yellow; She twined it round her lily hand, And drew him out o Yarrow. 15 She kissed his lips, and combed his head, As oft she'd done before, O; She laid him oer her milk-white steed, An bore him home from Yarrow. 16 She washed his wounds in yon well-strand, And dried him wi the hollan, And aye she sighed, and said, Alas! For my love I had him chosen. 17 ‘Go hold your tongue,’ her father said, ‘There's little cause for sorrow; I'll wed ye on a better lad Than ye hae lost in Yarrow.’ 18 ‘Haud your ain tongue, my faither dear, I canna help my sorrow; A fairer flower neer sprang in May Than I hae lost in Yarrow. 19 ‘I meant to make my bed fu wide, But you may make it narrow; For now I've nane to be my guide But a deid man drowned in Yarrow.’ 20 An aye she screighed, and cried Alas! Till her heart did break wi sorrow, An sank into her faither's arms, Mang the dowie dens o Yarrow.

But ae kiss o your bonny mouth Wad yield much comfort to me.’ 3 ‘O how can I come down?’ she says, ‘Or how can I win to thee? When there is nane that I can trust Wad safe convey me to thee. 4 ‘But gang doun, gang doun, to yon hostess' house, And there take on yere lawing, And, as I'm a woman kind and true, I'll meet you at the dawing.’ 5 Then he gade thro the good green-wood, And oer the moor sae eerie, And lang he stayd, and sair he sighd, But he never mair saw his dearie. 6 And ay he sat, and lang he drank, And ay he counted his lawing, Till fifteen men did him surround, To slay him or the dawing. 7 ‘O she promisd ance to meet me this night, But I find she has deceived me; She promisd ance to meet me this night, And she's sent fifteen to slay me! 8 ‘There are twa swords in my scabard, They cost me gowd and money; Take ye the best, and gie me the warst, And man for man I'll try ye.’ 9 Then they fought on, and on they fought, Till maist o them were fallen, When her brother John cam him behind, And slew him at the dawing. 10 Then he's away to his sister Anne, To the chamber where's she's lying: ‘Come doun, come doun, my sister Anne, And take up your true-love Jamie! 11 ‘Come doun, come doun now, sister Anne! For he's sleeping in yon logie; Sound, sound he sleeps, nae mair to wake, And nae mair need ye be vogie.’ 12 ‘I dreamd a drearie dream yestreen, Gin it be true, it will prove my sorrow; I dreamd my luive had lost his life, Within the yetts o Gowrie. 13 ‘O wae betide ye, lassies o Gowrie For ye hae sleepit soundly; Gin ye had keepit your yetts shut, Ye might hae sav'd the life o my Jamie. 14 ‘Yestreen my luive had a suit o claise Were o the finest tartan; But lang or ere the day did daw They war a' red bluid to the garten. 15 ‘Yestreen my luive had a suit o claise Were o the apple reamin; But lang or ere the day did daw The red bluid had them streamin.’ 16 In yon fair ha, where the winds did blaw, When the moon shone fair and clearly, She's thrawn her green skirt oer her head, And ay she cried out mercy.

O open and lat me in! For my boots are full o Clyde's water And frozen to the brim.’ 11 ‘I darena open the door to you, Nor darena lat you in, For my mither she is fast asleep, And I darena mak nae din.’ 12 ‘O gin ye winna open the door, Nor yet be kind to me, Now tell me o some out-chamber Where I this nicht may be.’ 13 ‘Ye canna win in this nicht, Willie, Nor here ye canna be; For I've nae chambers out nor in, Nae ane but barely three. 14 ‘The tane o them is fu o corn, The tither is fu o hay; The tither is fu o merry young men; They winna remove till day.’ 15 ‘O fare ye weel, then, May Margaret, Sin better manna be; I've win my mither's malison, Coming this nicht to thee.’ 16 He's mounted on his coal-black steed, O but his heart was wae! But, ere he came to Clyde's water, 'Twas half up oer the brae. 17 he plunged in, But never raise again.

The warstan bower in a' your bowers, For me to lie therein! My boots are fu o Clyde's water, I'm shivering at the chin.’ 15 ‘My barns are fu o corn, Willie, My stables are fu o hay; My bowers are fu o gentlemen, They'll nae remove till day.’ 16 ‘O fare ye well, my fause Meggie, O farewell, and adieu! I've gotten my mither's malison This night coming to you.’ 17 As he rode ower yon high, high hill, And down yon dowie den, The rushing that was in Clyde's water Took Willie's cane frae him. 18 He leand him ower his saddle-bow, To catch his cane again; The rushing that was in Clyde's water Took Willie's hat frae him. 19 He leand him ower his saddle-bow, To catch his hat thro force; The rushing that was in Clyde's water Took Willie frae his horse. 20 His brither stood upo the bank, Says, Fye, man, will ye drown? Ye'll turn ye to your high horse head And learn how to sowm. 21 ‘How can I turn to my horse head And learn how to sowm? I've gotten my mither's malison, It's here that I maun drown.’ 22 The very hour this young man sank Into the pot sae deep, Up it wakend his love Meggie Out o her drowsy sleep. 23 ‘Come here, come here, my mither dear, And read this dreary dream; I dreamd my love was at our gates, And nane wad let him in.’ 24 ‘Lye still, lye still now, my Meggie, Lye still and tak your rest; Sin your true-love was at your yates, It's but twa quarters past.’ 25 Nimbly, nimbly raise she up, And nimbly pat she on, And the higher that the lady cried, The louder blew the win. 26 The first an step that she steppd in, She stepped to the queet; ‘Ohon, alas!’ said that lady, ‘This water's wondrous deep.’ 27 The next an step that she wade in, She wadit to the knee; Says she, ‘I coud wide farther in, If I my love coud see.’ 28 The next an step that she wade in, She wadit to the chin; The deepest pot in Clyde's water She got sweet Willie in. 29 ‘You've had a cruel mither, Willie, And I have had anither; But we shall sleep in Clyde's water Like sister an like brither.’ 217 THE BROOM OF COWDENKNOWS The Laird of Knotington THE BROOM OF COWDENKNOWS—A Percy papers; communicated to Percy by R.

Broom o the Cowdenknowes THE BROOM OF COWDENKNOWS—M Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 172. 1 'Twas on a misty day, a fair maiden gay Went out to the Cowdenknowes; Lang, lang she thought ere her ewes woud bught, Wi her pail for to milk the ewes. O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom, The broom o the Cowdenknowes! And aye sae sweet as the lassie sang, In the ewe-bught, milking her ewes. 2 And aye as she sang the greenwoods rang, Her voice was sae loud and shrill; They heard the voice o this well-far'd maid At the other side o the hill. 3 ‘My mother she is an ill woman, And an ill woman is she; Or than she might have got some other maid To milk her ewes without me. 4 ‘My father was ance a landed laird, As mony mair have been; But he held on the gambling trade Till a's free lands were dune. 5 ‘My father drank the brandy and beer, My mother the wine sae red; Gars me, poor girl, gang maiden lang, For the lack o tocher guid.’ 6 There was a troop o merry gentlemen Came riding alang the way, And one o them drew the ewe-bughts unto, At the voice o this lovely may. 7 ‘O well may you sing, my well-far'd maid, And well may you sing, I say, For this is a mirk and a misty night, And I've ridden out o my way.’ 8 ‘Ride on, ride on, young man,’ she said, ‘Ride on the way ye ken; But keep frae the streams o the Rock-river, For they run proud and vain. 9 ‘Ye winna want boys for meat, kind sir, And ye winna want men for fee; It sets not us that are young women To show young men the way.’ 10 ‘O winna ye pity me, fair maid? O winna ye pity me? O winna ye pity my poor steed, Stands trembling at yon tree?’ 11 ‘Ride on, ride on, ye rank rider, Your steed's baith stout and strang; For out o the ewe-bught I winna come, For fear that ye do me wrang. 12 ‘For well ken I by your high-colld hat, And by your gay gowd ring, That ye are the Earl o Rock-rivers, That beguiles a' our young women.’ 13 ‘O I'm not the Earl o the Rock-rivers, Nor ever thinks to be; But I am ane o his finest knights, Rides aft in his companie. 14 ‘I know you well by your lamar beads, And by your merry winking ee, That ye are the maid o the Cowdenknowes, And may very well seem to be.’ 15 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, He's laid her down by the ewe-bught-wa, At her he spiered nae leave. 16 When he had got his wills o her, And his wills he had taen, He lifted her up by the middle sae sma, Says, Fair maid, rise up again. 17 Then he has taen out a siller kaim, Kaimd down her yellow hair; Says, Fair maid, take that, keep it for my sake, Case frae me ye never get mair. 18 Then he put his hand in his pocket, And gien her guineas three; Says, Take that, fair maiden, till I return, 'T will pay the nurse's fee. 19 Then he lap on his milk-white steed, And he rade after his men, And a' that they did say to him, ‘Dear master, ye've tarried lang.’ 20 ‘I've ridden east, I've ridden west, And over the Cowdenknowes, But the bonniest lass that eer I did see, Was i the ewe-bught, milking her ewes.’ 21 She's taen her milk-pail on her head, And she gaed singing hame; But a' that her auld father did say, ‘Daughter, ye've tarried lang.’ ‘O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom, The broom o the Cowdenknowes! Aye sae sair's I may rue the day, In the ewe-bughts, milking my ewes. 22 ‘O this is a mirk and a misty night, O father, as ye may see; The ewes they ran skipping over the knowes, And they woudna bught in for me. 23 ‘Before that he'd taen the lamb that he took, I rather he'd taen other three.’ 24 When twenty weeks were come and gane, And twenty weeks and three, The lassie's colour grew pale and wan, And she longed this knight to see. 25 Says, ‘Wae to the fox came amo our flock! I wish he had taen them a' Before that he'd taen frae me what he took; It's occasiond my downfa.’ 26 It fell ance upon a time She was ca'ing hame her kye, There came a troop o merry gentlemen, And they wyled the bonny lassie by. 27 But one o them spake as he rode past, Says, Who owes the bairn ye are wi? A little she spake, but thought wi hersell, ‘Perhaps to ane as gude as thee.’ 28 O then she did blush as he did pass by, And dear! but she thought shame, And all that she did say to him, ‘Sir, I have a husband at hame.’ 29 ‘Ye lie, ye lie, ye well-far'd maid, Sae loud as I hear you lie! For dinna ye mind yon misty night, Ye were in the bught wi me? ‘O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom, The broom o the Cowdenknowes! Aye say sweet as I heard you sing, In the ewe-bughts, milking your ewes.’ 30 ‘O well do I mind, kind sir,’ she said, ‘As ye rode over the hill; Ye took frae me my maidenhead, Fell sair against my will. ‘O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom, The broom o the Cowdenknowes! And aye sae sair as I rue the day I met you, milking my ewes. 31 ‘And aye as ye spake, ye lifted your hat, Ye had a merry winking ee; I ken you well to be the man, Then kind sir, O pity me!’ 32 ‘Win up, win up, fair maiden,’ he said, ‘Nae langer here ye'll stay; This night ye'se be my wedded wife, Without any more delay.’ 33 He lighted aff his milk-white steed And set the lassie on; ‘Ca in your kye, auld man,’ he did say, ‘She'll neer ca them in again. 34 ‘I am the Earl o the Rock-rivers, Hae fifty ploughs and three, And am sure I've chosen the fairest maid That ever my eyes did see.’ 35 Then he stript her o the robes o grey, Donned her in the robes o green, And when she came to her lord's ha They took her to be some queen. O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom, The broom o the Cowdenknowes! And aye sae sweet as the bonny lassie sang, That ever she milked the ewes. The Laird of Lochinvar THE BROOM OF COWDENKNOWS—N Kinloch MSS, I, 145; from Mary Barr. 1 O there war a troop o merry gentlemen Cam riding oure the knowes, And they hear the voice o a bonny lass, In the buchts, milking the yowes. 2 ‘O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may! O saved may ye be! My steed he has riden wrang, Fain wad I ken the way.’ 3 She has tane the steed by the bridle-reins, Has led him till the way, And he has tane out three gowd rings, Gien them to that bonnie may. 4 And he has tane her by the milk-white hand And by the gerss-green sleeve, And he laid her doun on the side o yon hill, At her daddie speird na leave. 5 Now she has hame to her father gane, Her father did her blame: ‘O whare hae ye been, my ae dochter? For ye hae na been your lane.’ 6 ‘O the nicht is mirk, and very, very wet, Ye may gang to the door and see; O there's nabody been wi me, father, There's nabody been wi me. 7 ‘But there cam a tod to your bucht, father, The like o him I neer saw; Afore you'd gien him the lamb that he took, Ye'd rather hae gien them a'. 8 ‘O wae be to my father's sheep-hird, An ill death may he dee! For bigging the bucht sae nar the road, Let the Lochinvar to me!’ 9 She's tane her pig and her cog in her hand, And she's gane to milk the kye; But ere she was aware, the Laird o Lochinvar Cam riding in the way. 10 ‘O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may! I wish ye may be sound; O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may! What maks thy belly sae round?’ 11 O she has turnd hersel round about, And she within her thoucht shame: ‘O it's nabody's wills wi me, kind sir, For I hae a gudeman o my ain.’ 12 ‘Ye lee, ye lee, my bonnie may, Weel do I ken ye lee! For dinna ye mind o the three gowd rings I gied ye o the new moneye?’ 13 ‘O weel do I mind thee, kind sir, O weel do I mind thee; For ae whan ye spak ye lifted up your hat, And ye had a bonnie twinklin ee.’ 14 ‘O ye need na toil yoursel, my dear, Neither to card nor to spin; For there's ten pieces I gie unto thee; Keep them for your lying in.’ 15 Now she has hame to her father gane, As fast as she could hie; And she was na weel crownd wi joy Till her auld son gat she. 16 But she'll na tell the daddie o it Till father nor to mither, And she'll na tell the daddie o it To sister nor to brither. 17 And word is to the Lochinvar, And word is to him gane, That sic a tenant's dochter Has born a bastard son: 18 And she'll na tell the daddie o it To father nor to mither, And she'll na tell the daddie o it Till sister nor to brither. 19 ‘O weel do I ken the reason o that, And the reason weel do I ken; O weel ken I the reason o that; It's to some o her father's men. 20 ‘But I will awa to Littlejohn's house, Shule them out o the door; For there's na tenant on a' my land Shall harbour an arrant hure.’ 21 Then out and spak the house-keeper, ‘Ye'd better lat her abee; For an onie harm befa this may, A' the wyte will be on me.’ 22 O he has turnd himsel round about, Within himsel thoucht he ‘Better do I loe her little finger Than a' thy haill bodie. 23 ‘Gae saddle to me my six coach-mares, Put a' their harness on, And I will awa to Littlejohn's house For reports o this bastard son.’ 24 Now whan he cam to Littlejohn's house, Littlejohn was at the door: ‘Ye rascal, ye rogue, ye impudent dog, Will ye harbour an arrant hure!’ 25 ‘O pardon me, my sovereign liege, O pardon me, I pray; Oh that the nicht that she was born She'd deed the very neist day!’ 26 But he is in to his bonnie lassie gane, And has bolted the door behind, And there he has kissd his bonnie lassie sweet, It's over and over again. 27 ‘Ye did weel, ye did weel, my bonnie may, To keep the secret twixt me and thee; For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair, The lady o't I'll mak thee. 28 ‘Come doun, come doun, now gentlemen a', And set this fair lady on; Mither, ye may milk the ewes as ye will, For she'll neer milk them again. 29 ‘For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair, O thirty plows and three, And I hae gotten the bonniest may That's in a' the south countrie.’ 218 THE FALSE LOVER WON BACK The Fause Lover THE FALSE LOVER WON BACK—A Buchan's MSS, I, 114. 1 A fair maid sat in her bower-door, Wringing her lily hands, And by it came a sprightly youth, Fast tripping oer the strands. 2 ‘Where gang ye, young John,’ she says, ‘Sae early in the day? It gars me think, by your fast trip, Your journey's far away.’ 3 He turnd about wi surly look, And said, What's that to thee? I'm gaen to see a lovely maid, Mair fairer far than ye. 4 ‘Now hae ye playd me this, fause love, In simmer, mid the flowers? I shall repay ye back again, In winter, mid the showers. 5 ‘But again, dear love, and again, dear love, Will ye not turn again? For as ye look to other women, I shall to other men.’ 6 ‘Make your choice of whom you please, For I my choice will have; I've chosen a maid more fair than thee, I never will deceive.’ 7 But she's kilt up her claithing fine, And after him gaed she; But aye he said, Ye'll turn again, Nae farder gae wi me. 8 ‘But again, dear love, and again, dear love, Will ye never love me again? Alas for loving you sae well, And you nae me again!’ 9 The first an town that they came till, He bought her brooch and ring; And aye he bade her turn again, And gang nae farder wi him. 10 ‘But again, dear love, and again, dear love, Will ye never love me again? Alas for loving you sae well, And you nae me again!’ 11 The next an town that they came till, He bought her muff and gloves; But aye he bade her turn again, And choose some other loves. 12 ‘But again, dear love, and again, dear love, Will ye never love me again? Alas for loving you sae well, And you nae me again!’ 13 The next an town that they came till, His heart it grew mair fain, And he was as deep in love wi her As she was ower again. 14 The next an town that they came till, He bought her wedding gown, And made her lady of ha's and bowers, Into sweet Berwick town. The Place where my love Johnny dwells THE FALSE LOVER WON BACK—B Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 144; from the recitation of a woman born in Buchan. 1 The sun shines high on yonder hill, And low on yonder town; In the place where my love Johnny dwells, The sun gaes never down. 2 ‘O when will ye be back, bonny lad, O when will ye be hame?’ ‘When heather-hills are nine times brunt, And a' grown green again.’ 3 ‘O that's ower lang awa, bonny lad, O that's ower lang frae hame; For I'll be dead and in my grave Ere ye come back again.’ 4 He put his foot into the stirrup And said he maun go ride, But she kilted up her green claithing And said she woudna bide. 5 The firsten town that they came to, He bought her hose and sheen, And bade her rue and return again, And gang nae farther wi him. 6 ‘Ye likena me at a', bonny lad, Ye likena me at a';’ ‘It's sair for you likes me sae weel And me nae you at a'.’ 7 The nexten town that they came to, He bought her a braw new gown, And bade her rue and return again, And gang nae farther wi him. 8 The nexten town that they came to, He bought her a wedding ring, And bade her dry her rosy cheeks, And he would tak her wi him. 9 ‘O wae be to your bonny face, And your twa blinkin een! And wae be to your rosy cheeks! They've stown this heart o mine. 10 ‘There's comfort for the comfortless, There's honey for the bee; There's comfort for the comfortless, There's nane but you for me.’ 219 THE GARDENER The Gardener THE GARDENER—A Kinloch MSS, V, 47, in the handwriting of James Beattie; from the recitation of his aunt, Miss Elizabeth Beattie. 1 The gardener stands in his bower-door, With a primrose in his hand, And by there came a leal maiden, As jimp's a willow wand. And by, etc. 2 ‘O lady, can you fancy me, For to be my bride, You'll get a' the flowers in my garden, To be to you a weed. 3 ‘The lily white shall be your smock; Becomes your body neat; And your head shall be deckd with jellyflower, And the primrose in your breast. 4 ‘Your gown shall be o the sweet-william, Your coat o camovine, And your apron o the salads neat, That taste baith sweet and fine. 5 ‘Your stockings shall be o the broad kail-blade, That is baith broad and long; And narrow, narrow at the coot, And broad, broad at the brawn. 6 ‘Your gloves shall be the marygold, All glittering to your hand, Well spread oer wi the blue blaewort, That grows in corn-land.’ 7 ‘O fare you well, young man,’ she says, ‘Farewell, and I bid adieu; Since you've provided a weed for me, Among the summer flowers, Then I'll provide another for you, Among the winter showers. 8 ‘The new-fallen snow to be your smock; Becomes your body neat; And your head shall be deckd with the eastern wind, And the cold rain on your breast.’ The Gardener Lad THE GARDENER—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 187 1 All ye young men, I pray draw near, I'll let you hear my mind Concerning those who fickle are, And inconstant as the wind. 2 A pretty maid who late livd here, And sweethearts many had, The gardener-lad he viewd them all, Just as they came and gaed. 3 The gardener-lad he viewd them all, But swore he had no skill: ‘If I were to go as oft to her, Ye surely would me kill. 4 ‘I'm sure she's not a proper maid, I'm sure she is not tall;’ Another young man standing by, He said, Slight none at all. 5 ‘For we're all come of woman,’ he said, ‘If ye woud call to mind, And to all women for her sake Ye surely should be kind.’ 6 ‘The summer hours and warm showers Make the trees yield in the ground, And kindly words will woman win, And this maid I'll surround.’ 7 The maid then stood in her bower-door, As straight as ony wand, When by it came the gardener-lad, With his hat in his hand. 8 ‘Will ye live on fruit,’ he said? ‘Or will ye marry me? And amongst the flowers in my garden I'll shape a weed for thee.’ 9 ‘I will live on fruit,’ she says, ‘But I'll never marry thee; For I can live without mankind, And without mankind I'll die.’ 10 ‘Ye shall not live without mankind, If ye'll accept of me; For among the flowers in my garden I'll shape a weed for thee. 11 ‘The lily white to be your smock; Becomes your body best; And the jelly-flower to be your quill, And the red rose in your breast. 12 ‘Your gown shall be o the pingo white, Your petticoat cammovine, Your apron o the seel o downs; Come smile, sweet heart o mine! 13 ‘Your shoes shall be o the gude rue red — Never did I garden ill — Your stockings o the mary mild; Come smile, sweet heart, your fill! 14 ‘Your gloves shall be o the green clover, Comes lockerin to your hand, Well dropped oer wi blue blavers, That grow among white land.’ 15 ‘Young man, ye've shap'd a weed for me, In summer among your flowers; Now I will shape another for you, Among the winter showers. 16 ‘The snow so white shall be your shirt; It becomes your body best; The cold bleak wind to be your coat, And the cold wind in your breast. 17 ‘The steed that you shall ride upon Shall be o the weather snell, Well bridled wi the northern wind, And cold sharp showers o hail. 18 ‘The hat you on your head shall wear Shall be o the weather gray, And aye when you come into my sight I'll wish you were away.’ THE GARDENER—C Communicated from memory by Dr Thomas Davidson as learned in Old Deer, Aberdeenshire. 1 Burd Ellen stands in her bower-door, As straucht's a hollan wand, And by it comes the gairdner-lad, Wi a red rose in his hand. 2 Says, I have shapen a weed for thee Amang my simmer flowers; 3 ‘Gin ye hae shapen a weed for me, Amang your simmer flowers, It's I'll repay ye back again, Amang the winter showers. 4 ‘The steed that ye sall ride upon Sall be o the frost sae snell, And I'll saddle him wi the norlan winds, And some sharp showers o hail.’ 220 THE BONNY LASS OF ANGLESEY The Bonny Lass of Anglesey THE BONNY LASS OF ANGLESEY—A Herd's MSS, I, 148. 1 Our king he has a secret to tell, And ay well keepit it must be: The English lords are coming down To dance and win the victory. 2 Our king has cry'd a noble cry, And ay well keepit it must be: ‘Gar saddle ye, and bring to me The bonny lass of Anglesey.’ 3 Up she starts, as white as the milk, Between him and his company: What is the thing I hae to ask, If I sould win the victory?’ 4 ‘Fifteen ploughs but and a mill I gie thee till the day thou die, And the fairest knight in a' my court To chuse thy husband for to be.’ 5 She's taen the fifteen lord[s] by the hand, Saying, ‘Will ye come dance with me?’ But on the morn at ten o'clock They gave it oer most shamefully. 6 Up then rais the fifteenth lord — I wat an angry man was he — Laid by frae him his belt and sword, And to the floor gaed manfully. 7 He said, ‘My feet shall be my dead Before she win the victory;’ But before 't was ten o'clock at night He gaed it oer as shamefully.

O 2 Out came the Laird of Lauderdale, Out frae the South Countrie, All for to court this pretty maid, Her bridegroom for to be. 3 He has teld her father and mither baith, And a' the rest o her kin, And has teld the lass hersell, And her consent has win. 4 Then came the Laird of Lochinton, Out frae the English border, All for to court this pretty maid, Well mounted in good order. 5 He's teld her father and mither baith, As I hear sindry say, But he has nae teld the lass her sell, Till on her wedding day. 6 When day was set, and friends were met, And married to be, Lord Lauderdale came to the place, The bridal for to see. 7 ‘O are you came for sport, young man; Or are you come for play? Or are you come for a sight o our bride, Just on her wedding day?’ 8 ‘I'm nouther come for sport,’ he says, ‘Nor am I come for play; But if I had one sight o your bride, I'll mount and ride away.’ 9 There was a glass of the red wine Filld up them atween, And ay she drank to Lauderdale, Wha her true-love had been. 10 Then he took her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, And he mounted her high behind him there, At the bridegroom he askt nae leive. 11 Then the blude run down by the Cowden Banks, And down by Cowden Braes, And ay she gard the trumpet sound, ‘O this is foul, foul play!’ 12 Now a' ye that in England are, Or are in England born, Come nere to Scotland to court a lass, Or else ye'l get the scorn. 13 They haik ye up and settle ye by, Till on your wedding day, And gie ye frogs instead o fish, And play ye foul, foul play.

Or came you here to flee? Or cam you here to drink good wine, And be good company?’ 11 They filled a cup o good red wine, Drunk out between them twa: ‘For one dance wi your bonny bride, I shall gae hame my wa.’ 12 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, He's mounted her high behind himself, At her kin's speired nae leave. 13 Now And swords flew in the skies, And droop and drowsie was the blood Ran our yon lilly braes. 14 The blood ran our the lilly bank, And our the lilly brae, And sighing said the bonny bride, ‘A, wae's me for foul play!’ 15 ‘My blessing on your heart, sweet thing, Wae to your wilfu will! So many a gallant gentleman's blood This day as ye've garred spill. 16 ‘But a' you that is norland men, If you be norland born, Come never south to wed a bryde, For they'll play you the scorn. 17 ‘They will play you the scorn Upo your wedding-day, And gie you frogs instead o fish, And do you foul, foul play.’ Katherine Jaffarie KATHARINE JAFFARY—C “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 30, Abbotsford.

Or came you for a sight of my bonnie bride, Upon her wedding-day?’ 14 ‘I came not here for sport,’ he says, ‘Nor came I here for play; But an I had ae word of your bride, I'll horse and gae my way.’ 15 The first time that he calld on her, Her answer was him Nay; But the next time that he calld on her, She was not slow to gae. 16 He took her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, He's pulld her on behind him, At the bridegroom speard nae leave. 17 The blood ran up the Caden bank, And down the Caden brae, And ay she bade the trumpet sound ‘It's a' for foul, foul play.’ 18 ‘I wonder o you English squires, That are in England born, That ye come to court our Scots lasses, For fear ye get the scorn. 19 ‘For fear you get the scorn,’ she says, ‘Upon your wedding-day; They'll gee you frogs instead of fish, And take your bride away.’ 20 Fair fa the lads of Lamington, Has taen their bride away! They'll set them up in temper wood And scorn you all day.

Catharine Jaffery KATHARINE JAFFARY—G Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 34. 1 O bonny Catharine Jaffery, That dainty maid so fair, Once lovd the laird of Lochinvar, Without any compare. 2 Long time she lood him very well, But they changed her mind away, And now she goes another's bride, And plays him foul play. 3 The bonny laird of Lauderdale Came from the South Countrie, And he has wooed the pretty maid, Thro presents entered he. 4 For tocher-gear he did not stand, She was a dainty may; He'greed him with her friends all, And set the wedding-day. 5 When Lochinvar got word of this, He knew not what to do, For losing of a lady fair That he did love so true. 6 ‘But if I were young Lochinvar, I woud not care a fly To take her on her wedding-day From all her company. 7 ‘Get ye a quiet messenger, Send him thro all your land For a hundred and fifty brave young lads, To be at your command. 8 ‘To be all at your command, And your bidding to obey, Yet still cause you the trumpet sound The voice of foul play.’ 9 He got a quiet messenger To send thro all his land, And full three hundred pretty lads Were all at his command. 10 Were all at his command, And his bidding did obey, Yet still he made the trumpet sound The voice of foul play. 11 Then he went to the bridal-house, Among the nobles a', And when he stepped upon the floor He gave a loud huzza. 12 ‘Huzza! huzza! you English men, Or borderers who were born, Neer come to Scotland for a maid, Or else they will you scorn. 13 ‘She'll bring you on with tempting words, Aye till the wedding-day, Syne give you frogs instead of fish, And play you foul play.’ 14 The gentlemen all wondered What could be in his mind, And asked if he'd a mind to fight; Why spoke he so unkind? 15 Did he e'er see such pretty men As were there in array? ‘O yes,’ said he, ‘a Fairy Court Were leaping on the hay. 16 ‘As I came in by Hyland banks, And in by Hyland braes, There did I see a Fairy Court, All leaping on the leas. 17 ‘I came not here to fight,’ he said, ‘But for good fellowship gay; I want to drink with your bridegroom, And then I'll boun my way.’ 18 The glass was filled with good red wine, And drunk between them twae: ‘Give me one shake of your bonny bride's hand, And then I'll boun my way.’ 19 He's taen her by the milk-white hands, And by the grass-green sleeve, Pulld her on horseback him behind, At her friends askd nae leave. 20 Syne rode the water with great speed, And merrily the knows; There fifty from the bridal came — Indeed it was nae mows — 21 Thinking to take the bride again, Thro strength if that they may; But still he gart the trumpet sound The voice of foul play. 22 There were four and twenty ladies fair All walking on the lea; He gave to them the bonny bride, And bade them boun their way. 23 They splintered the spears in pieces now, And the blades flew in the sky, But the bonny laird of Lochinvar Has gained the victory. 24 Many a wife- and widow's son Lay gasping on the ground, But the bonny laird of Lochinvar He has the victory won. KATHARINE JAFFARY—H Kinloch MSS, V, 313. 1 There was a lady fair, fair, Lived low down in yon glen, O And she's been courted far an near By several gentlemen. O 2 At length the laird of Lammington Came frae the West Country, All to court that pretty girl, And her bridegroom for to be. 3 He told her father, so did he her mother, And all the rest of her kin, And he has told the lass hersel, And her kind favour has won. 4 At length the laird of Laughenwaur Came frae the English border, And all to court that pretty girl, Well mounted in good order. 5 He told her father, so did he her mother, As I heard people say, But he ner told the lass hersel, Till on her wedding-day. 6 But when the wedding-day was fixed, And married for to be, Then Lamington came to the town, The bridegroom for to see. 7 ‘O are ye come for sport, sir?’ he said, ‘Or are ye come for play? Or are ye for a sight o my bonny bride, Upon her wedding-day?’ 8 ‘A'm neither come for sport, sir,’ he said, ‘Nor am I come for play, But if I had one word o the bride I'd mount and go away.’ 9 There was a cup of the good red wine Was filled out them between, And aye she drank to Lammington, Who her true-love had been. 10 He's taen her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve; He's mounted her behind him then, At the bridegroom speered no leave. 11 The blood ran down by Cowden banks, And down by Cowden brae, And aye they gaured the piper play ‘It was a foul, foul play.’ 12 Ye gentlemen of Lochenwaur, That's laigh in England born, Come ner to Scotland to court a wife, Or be sure ye'l get the scorn. 13 The'll keep ye up, and tamper ye at, Until yer wedding-day, And they'l gie ye frogs instead o fish, And they'll play ye a foul play. KATHARINE JAFFARY—I Motherwell's MS., p. 327, “from the recitation of Robert Sim, weaver, in Paisley, 16 July, 1825. It was a song of his father's, a great reciter of heroick ballads.” 1 In Bordershellin there did dwell A comely, handsome may, And Lochinvar he courted her, And stole her heart away. 2 She loved him but owre weel, And his love drew away; Another man then courted her, And set the wedding-day, 3 They set the wedding-day so plain, As plain as it might be; She sent a letter to her former love, The wedding to come see. 4 When Lochinvar the letter read, He sent owre a' his land For four and twenty beltit knichts, To come at his command. 5 They all came to his hand, I say, Upon that wedding-day; He set them upon milk-white steeds, And put them in array. 6 He set them in array, I say, Most pleasant to be seen, And he's awa to the wedding-house, A single man his lane. 7 And when he was to the wedding-house come, They were all sitten down; Baith gentlemen and knichts was there, And lords of high renown. 8 They saluted him, baith auld and young, Speired how he had spent the day, And what young Lankashires was yon They saw all in array. 9 But he answerd them richt scornfullie, Upon their wedding-day; He says, It's been some Fairy Court Ye've seen all in array. 10 Then rose up the young bridegroom, And an angry man was he: ‘Lo, art thou come to fight, young man? Indeed I'll fight wi thee.’ 11 ‘O I am not.come to fight,’ he sayd, ‘But good fellowship to hae, And for to drink the wine sae red, And then I'll go away.’ 12 Then they filld him up a brimming glass, And drank it between them twa: ‘Now one word of your bonnie bride, And then I'll go my wa.’ 13 But some were friends, and some were faes, Yet nane o them was free To let the bride on her wedding-day Gang out o their companie. 14 But he took her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve, And set her on a milk-white steed, And at nane o them speerd he leave. 15 Then the blood ran down the Caylin bank, And owre the Caylin brae; The auld folks knew something o the sport, Which gart them cry, Foul play! 16 Ye lusty lads of Limberdale, Tho ye be English born, Come nae mair to Scotland to court a maid, For fear ye get the scorn. 17 For fear that ye do get the scorn Upon your wedding-day; Least ye catch frogs instead of fish, And then ye'll ca't foul play. Catherine Johnson; or, Catherine Johnstone KATHARINE JAFFARY—J Motherwell's MS., p. 75, from the recitation of Mrs Thomson, an old woman of Kilbarchan. 1 There was a lass, as I heard say, Lived low down in a glen; Her name was Catharine Johnson, Weel known to many men. 2 Doun cam the laird o Lamingtoun, Doun frae the South Countrie, And he is for this bonnie lass, Her bridegroom for to be. 3 He's askd her father and mother, The chief of a' her kin, And then he askd the bonnie lass, And did her favour win. 4 Doun cam an English gentleman, Doun frae the English border; He is for this bonnie lass, To keep his house in order. 5 He askd her father and mother, As I do hear them say, But he never askd the lass hersell, Till on her wedding-day. 6 But she has wrote a lang letter, And sealed it wi her hand, And sent it to Lord Lamington, To let him understand. 7 The first line o the letter he read, He was baith glad and fain; But or he read the letter owre He was baith pale and wan. 8 Then he has sent a messenger, And out through all his land, And four-and-twenty armed men Was all at his command. 9 But he has left his merry men, Left them on the lea; And he's awa to the wedding-house, To see what he could see. 10 But when he came to the wedding-house, As I do understand, There were four-and-twenty belted knights Sat at a table round. 11 They rose all for to honour him, For he was of high renown; They rose all for to welcome him, And bade him to sit doun. 12 O meikle was the good red wine In silver cups did flow, But aye she drank to Lamingtoun, For with him would she go. 13 O meikle was the good red wine In silver cups gaed round; At length they began to whisper words, None could them understand. 14 ‘O came ye here for sport, young man? Or cam ye here for play? Or cam ye for our bonnie bride, On this her wedding-day?’ 15 ‘I came not here for sport,’ he said, ‘Neither did I for play; But for one word o your bonnie bride I'll mount and ride away.’ 16 They set her maids behind her, To hear what they would say, But the first question he askd at her Was always [answered] nay; The next question he askd at her Was, ‘Mount and come away.’ 17 It's up the Couden bank, And doun the Couden brae; And aye she made the trumpet sound, ‘It's a weel won play.’ 18 O meikle was the blood was shed Upon the Couden brae; And aye she made the trumpet sound, ‘It's a' fair play.’ 19 Come, all ye English gentlemen, That is of England born, Come nae doun to Scotland, For fear ye get the scorn. 20 They'll feed ye up wi flattering words, And that's foul play; And they'll dress ye frogs instead o fish, Just on your wedding-day. Loch-in-var KATHARINE JAFFARY—K Buchan's Gleanings of Scotch, English and Irish Scarce Old Ballads, 1825, pp. 74, 193; “taken down from oral tradition.” 1 There lives a lass in yonder dale, In yon bonny borrows-town, Her name it is Catherine Jeffrey, She is loved by mony a ane. 2 Lord Lochinvar has courted her These twelve months and a day; With flattering words and fair speeches He has stown her heart away. 3 There came a knight from south sea-bank, From north England I mean, He alighted at her father's yetts, His stile is Lord Lymington. 4 He has courted her father and moth Her kinsfolk ane and aye, But he never told the lady hersell Till he set the wedding-day. 5 ‘Prepare, prepare, my daughter dear, Prepare, to you I say; For the night it is good Wednesday night, And the morn is your wedding-day.’ 6 ‘O tell to me, father,’ she said, ‘O tell me who it is wi; For I'll never wed a man on earth Till I know what he be.’ 7 ‘He's come a knight from the south sea-bank, From north England I mean, For when he lighted at my yetts, His stile is Lord Lymington.’ 8 ‘O where will I get a bonny boy Will win baith meet and fee, And will run on to Lochinvar And come again to me?’ 9 ‘O here am I, a bonny boy That will win baith hose and sheen, And will run on to Lochinvar, And come right seen again.’ 10 ‘Where ye find the brigs broken, Bend your bow and swim; Where ye find the grass growing, Slack your bow and run. 11 ‘When ye come on to Lochinvar, Byde not to chap nor ca, But set your bent bow to your breast And lightly loup the wa. 12 ‘Bid him mind the words he last spake, When we sendered on the lee; Bid him saddle and ride full fast, If he be set for me.’ 13 Where he found the brigs broken, He bent his bow and swam; Where he found the grass growing, He slackt his bow and ran. 14 When he came on to Lochinvar, He did not chap nor ca; He set his bent bow till his breast And lightly leapt the wa. 15 ‘What news? what news, my bonny boy? What news have ye to me?’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my lord,' he said, ‘Your lady awa will be. 16 ‘You'r bidden mind the words ye last spake, When we sendered on the lee; You'r bidden saddle and ride full fast, Gin ye set for her be.’ 17 When he came to her father's yetts, There he alighted down; The cups of gold of good red wine Were going roun and roun. 18 ‘Now came ye here for sport?’ they said, ‘Or came ye here for play? Or for a sight of our bonny bride, And then to boun your way?’ 19 ‘I came not here for sport,’ he says, ‘Nor came I here for play, But if I had a sight of your bonny bride Then I will boun my way.’ 20 When Lymington he called on her, She would not come at a', But Lochinvar he called on her, And she was not sweer to draw. 21 He has taen her by the milk-white hand, And by her silken sleeve, He has mounted her high him behind, He spiered nae mair their leave. 22 And aye she scoffed and scorned them, And aye she rode away, And aye she gart the trumpet sound The voice of foul play, To take the bride frae her bridegroom Upon her wedding-day. 23 As they came in by Foudlin dyke, And in by Foudlin stane, There were mony gallant Englishmen Lay gasping on the green. 24 Now a' you that are English lords, And are in England born, Come never here to court your brides, For fear ye get the scorn. 25 For aye they'll scoff and scorn you, And aye they'll ride away; They'll gie you frogs instead of fish, And call it foul play.

Dundee, Baby? Dundee you neer shall see Till I've carried you to Glenlion And have my bride made thee. 9 ‘We'll stay a while at Auchingour, And get sweet milk and cheese, And syne we'll gang to Glenlion, And there live at our ease.’ 10 ‘I winna stay at Auchingour, Nor eat sweet milk and cheese, Nor go with thee to Glenlion, For there I'll neer find ease.’ 11 Than out it spake his brother John, ‘O were I in your place, I'd take that lady hame again, For a' her bonny face. 12 ‘Commend me to the lass that's kind, Tho na so gently born; And, gin her heart I coudna gain, To take her hand I'd scorn.’ 13 ‘O had your tongue now, John,’ he says, ‘You wis na what you say; For I've lood that bonny face This twelve month and a day. 14 ‘And tho I've lood her lang and sair A smile I neer coud win; Yet what I've got anse in my power To keep I think nae sin.’ 15 When they came to Glenlion castle, They lighted at the yate, And out it came his sisters three, Wha did them kindly greet. 16 O they've taen Baby by the hands And led her oer the green, And ilka lady spake a word, But bonny Baby spake nane. 17 Then out it spake her bonny Jean, The youngest o the three, ‘O lady, dinna look sae sad, But tell your grief to me.’ 18 ‘O wherefore should I tell my grief, Since lax I canna find? I'm stown frae a' my kin and friends, And my love I left behind. 19 ‘But had I paper, pen, and ink, Before that it were day, I yet might get a letter sent In time to Johny Hay.’ 20 O she's got paper, pen, and ink, And candle that she might see, And she has written a broad letter To Johny at Dundee. 21 And she has gotten a bonny boy, That was baith swift and strang, Wi philabeg and bonnet blue, Her errand for to gang. 22 ‘O boy, gin ye'd my blessing win And help me in my need, Run wi this letter to my love, And bid him come wi speed. 23 ‘And here's a chain of good red gowd, And gowdn guineas three, And when you've well your errand done, You'll get them for your fee.’ 24 The boy he ran oer hill and dale, Fast as a bird coud flee, And eer the sun was twa hours height The boy was at Dundee. 25 And when he came to Johny's door He knocked loud and sair; Then Johny to the window came, And loudly cry'd, ‘Wha's there?’ 26 ‘O here's a letter I have brought, Which ye maun quickly read, And, gin ye woud your lady save, Gang back wi me wi speed.’ 27 O when he had the letter read, An angry man was he; He says, Glenlion, thou shalt rue This deed of villany! 28 ‘O saddle to me the black, the black, O saddle to me the brown, O saddle to me the swiftest steed That eer rade frae the town. 29 ‘And arm ye well, my merry men a', And follow me to the glen, For I vow I'll neither eat nor sleep Till I get my love again.’ 30 He's mounted on a milk-white steed, The boy upon a gray, And they got to Glenlion's castle About the close of day. 31 As Baby at her window stood, The west wind saft did bla; She heard her Johny's well-kent voice Beneath the castle wa. 32 ‘O Baby, haste, the window jump! I'll kep you in my arm; My merry men a' are at the yate, To rescue you frae harm.’ 33 She to the window fixt her sheets And slipped safely down, And Johny catchd her in his arms, Neer loot her touch the ground. 34 When mounted on her Johny's horse, Fou blithely did she say, ‘Glenlion, you hae lost your bride! She's aff wi Johny Hay.’ 35 Glenlion and his brother John Were birling in the ha, When they heard Johny's bridle ring, As first he rade awa. 36 ‘Rise, Jock, gang out and meet the priest, I hear his bridle ring; My Baby now shall be my wife Before the laverocks sing.’ 37 ‘O brother, this is not the priest; I fear he'll come oer late; For armed men with shining brands Stand at the castle-yate.’ 38 ‘Haste Donald, Duncan, Dugald, Hugh! Haste, take your sword and spier! We'll gar these traytors rue the hour That eer they ventured here.’ 39 The Highland men drew their claymores, And gae a warlike shout, But Johny's merry men kept the yate, Nae ane durst venture out. 40 The lovers rade the live-lang night, And safe gat on their way, And bonny Baby Livingston Has gotten Johny Hay. 41 ‘Awa, Glenlion! fy for shame! Gae hide ye in some den! You've lettn your bride be stown frae you, For a' your armed men.’ Barbara Livingston BONNY BABY LIVINGSTON—B Buchan's MSS, I, 77. 1 Bonny Barbara Livingston Went out to take the air, When came the laird o Glenlyon And staw the maiden fair. 2 He staw her in her cloak, her cloak, He staw her in her gown; Before he let her look again, Was mony mile frae town. 3 So they rade over hills and dales, Through m[o]ny a wilsome way, Till they came to the head o yon hill, And showed her ewes and kye. 4 ‘O will ye stay with me, Barbara, And get good curds and whey? Or will ye go to Glenlyon, And be a lady gay?’ 5 ‘The Highlands is nae for me, kind sir, The Highlands is nae for me, But, gin ye woud my favour win, Have me to bonny Dundee.’ 6 ‘Dundee, Barbara?

The paper on which it is written has the water-mark 1822. 1 Rob Roy's from the Highlands come Down to the Lowland border, And there he's stole a fair lady away, To keep his house in order. 2 As he came in by Blackhill gate, Twenty men his arms did carry, And he has stole a fair lady away, On purpose hir to marry. 3 No tidings came unto the house, Nor none went in before him, Or else she had been run away, For she did still abhor him. 4 But with his men he surunded the house, Himself went in unto hir, And when that he had found her out He profest how much he lovt hir. 5 ‘O wilt thou be my dear?’ he says, ‘O wilt thou be my hony? O wilt thou be my wedded wife? For I love you far better than ony.’ 6 ‘I will not be your dear,’ she says, ‘I will not be your honey, I will not be your wedded wife; You love me for my money.’ 7 But he hir drew amongst his crew, She holding by hir mother; With doleful cries and watry eyes The parted from each other. 8 He gave hir no time for to dress As brides do when the marry, But fast he hurried hir away, And rowd hir in his plaidy. 9 He set hir on a milk-white steed, Himself lept on behind hir, And he has carried hir away, Hir friends the could not find hir. 10 The lady's cries were oftimes heard, But none durst venture to hir; She gaurded was on every side, Hir friends could not rescue hir. 11 As the went over hills and rocks, The lady oftimes fainted; Cries, Wo be to my curst mony, These roads to me invented. 12 As the came in by Drummond town And at Bachannan tarried, He bought to her a cloak and gown, Yet wad she not be married. 13 And when she came the priest before He askd if she would marry, But the parson's zeal it was so hot For her will he did not tarry. 14 Four held hir up before the priest, Tow laid hir in hir bed, O, But still she cried, with watry eyes, When she was by him laid O. 15 ‘Now you'r to the Highlands come, Out of your native clime, lady, Never think of going back, But tak it for your hame, lady. 16 ‘Be content, be content, Be content to stay, lady, Now you are my wedded wife, Until your dying day, lady. 17 ‘Rob Roy was my father calld, McGregor was his name, lady, And all the country where he dwelt None could exceed his fame, lady. 18 ‘I'll be kind, I'll be kind, I'll be kind to thee, lady, A' thy kindred for thy sake Shall truly favoured be, lady. 19 ‘My father reignd as Highland king, And ruled at his will, lady, There was nether lord nor duke Durst do him ony ill, lady. 20 ‘Ay through time, ay through time, Ay through time was he, lady, Filled was w[ith] sweet revenge On a' his enemys, lady. 21 ‘He was a hedge about his friends, A heckle till his foes, lady, And every ane that did him rang, He took them oer the nose, lady. 22 ‘I'm as bold, I'm as bold, [As bold] as forest boar, lady, Every ane that does thee rang Shall feell my stell claymore, lady. 23 ‘Neer a man from Highlands came That ever did him dare, lady, But if those persons did escape He sized upon there gear, lady.

O are we near hame, I pray?’ ‘We're no near hame, bonnie Lizzie, Nor yet the half o the way.’ 17 They cam to a homely poor cottage, An auld man was standing by: ‘Ye're welcome hame, Sir Donald, Ye've been sae lang away.’ 18 ‘O call me no more Sir Donald, But call me young Donald your son, For I have a bonnie young lady Behind me for to come in.’ 19 ‘Come in, come in, bonnie Lizzie, Come in, come in,’ said he; ‘Although that our cottage be little, Perhaps the better we'll gree. 20 ‘O make us a supper, dear mother, And make it of curds an green whey; And make us a bed o green rushes, And cover it oer wi green hay.’ 21 ‘Rise up, rise up, bonnie Lizzie, Why lie ye so long in the day?

And he convoyd her hame. 4 ‘My bonny Lizie Bailie, I'll row thee in my pladie, If thou will go along with me And be my Highland lady.’ 5 ‘If I would go along with thee, I think I were not wise; For I cannot milk cow nor ewe, Nor yet can I speak Erse.’ 6 ‘Hold thy tongue, bonny Lizie Bailie, And hold thy tongue,’ said he; ‘For any thing that thou does lack, My dear, I'll learn thee.’ 7 She would not have a Lowland laird, He wears the high-heeld shoes; She will marry Duncan Grahame, For Duncan wears his trews. 8 She would not have a gentleman, A farmer in Kilsyth, But she would have the Highland man, He lives into Monteith. 9 She would not have the Lowland man, Nor yet the English laddie, But she would have the Highland man, To row her in his pladie. 10 He took her by the milk-white hand, And he convoyed her hame, And still she thought, both night and day, On bonny Duncan Grahame. 11 ‘O bonny Duncan Grahame, Why should ye me miscarry?

Thy mother cannot want thee; For any thing that thou does lack, My dear, I'll cause get thee.’ 18 ‘I would not give my Duncan Grahame For all my father's land, Although he had three lairdships more, And all at my command.’ 19 And she's cast off her silken gowns, That she weard in the Lowland, And she's up to the Highland hills, To wear [the] gowns of tartain. 20 And she's cast off her high-heeld shoes, Was made of the gilded leather, And she's up to Gillecrankie, To go among the heather. 21 And she's cast off her high-heeld shoes, And put on a pair of laigh ones, And she's away with Duncan Grahame, To go among the brachans. 22 ‘O my bonny Lizie Bailie, Thy mother cannot want thee; And if thou go with Duncan Grahame Thou'll be a Gilliecrankie.’ 23 ‘Hold your tongue, my mother dear, And folly let thee be; Should not I fancie Duncan Grahame When Duncan fancies me? 24 ‘Hold your tongue, my father dear, And folly let thee be; For I will go with Duncan Grahame Fore all the men I see.’ 25 ‘Who is it that's done this turn? Who has done this deed?’ ‘A minister it's, father,’ she says, ‘Lives at the Rughburn bridge.’ 26 ‘A minister, daughter?’ he says, ‘A minister for mister!’ ‘O hold your tongue, my father dear, He married first my sister.’ 27 ‘O fare you well, my daughter dear, So dearly as I lovd thee!

Sayin, Ye may steal awa my cows and my ewes, But ye'll never steal awa my bonny Peggy. 3 ‘O haud yer tongue, ye silly auld man, For ye hae said eneugh already, For I'll never steal awa yer cows and yer ewes, But I'll steal awa yer bonny Peggy.’ 4 So he mounted her on a milk-white steed, Himsel upon a wee grey naigie, And they hae ridden ower hill and dale, And over moors and mosses many. 5 They rade till they cam to the head o yon glen, It might hae frightened anybody; He said, Whether will ye go alongst with me, Or will ye return back again to your mammie? 6 Their bed was o the green, green grass, And their blankets o the bracken sae bonnie, And he's laid his trews beneath their head, And Peggy's lain doun wi her Heilan laddie. 7 They lay till it cam to the break o day, Then up they rose and made them ready; He said, Whether will ye go alongst with me, Or will ye return back again to your mammie? 8 ‘I'll follow you through frost and snow, I'll follow you through dangers many, And wherever ye go I will go alongst with you, For I'll never return back again to my mammie.’ 9 ‘I hae four-and-twenty gude milk-kye, They're a' bun in yon byre sae bonny, And I am the earl o the Isle o Skye, And why should not Peggy be called a lady? 10 ‘I hae fifty acres o gude land, A' ploughed ower and sawn sae bonny, And I am young Donald o the Isle o Skye, And wherever I'm laird I'll make ye lady.’ 229 EARL CRAWFORD Earl Crawford EARL CRAWFORD—A a.

And wasna, etc. 3 But it fell ance upon a day I gaed into the garden green, And naebody was therein walking But Earl Crawford and his young son. 4 ‘I wonder at you, ye Earl Crawford, I wonder at you wi your young son; Ye daut your young son mair than your Lillie; [I'm sure you got na him your lane.’] 5 [He turned about upon his heel, I wite an angry man was he; Says, If I got nae my young son my lane, Bring me here the one that helpet me.] 6 [‘O hold your tongue, my Earl Crawford, And a' my folly lat it be; There was nane at the gettin o oor son, Nae body only but you and me.’] 7 He set her on a milk-white steed, Her little young son her before; Says, Ye maun gae to bonny Stobha, For ye will enter my yates no more. 8 When she cam to her father's bowers, She lichtit low down on the stane, And wha sae ready as her auld father To welcome Lady Lillie in? 9 ‘O how's a' wi you, my daughter Lillie, That ye come here sae hastilie? And how's a' wi' the Earl o Crawford, That he didna send a boy wi thee?’ 10 ‘O haud your tongue now, my old father, And ye'll lat a' your folly be; For ae word that my merry mou spak Has parted my good lord and me.’ 11 ‘O haud your tongue, my daughter Lillie, And a' your follies lat them be; I'll double your portion ten times ower, And a better match I'll get for thee.’ 12 ‘O haud your tongue now, my old father, And a' your folly lat it be; I wouldna gie ae kiss o Crawford For a' the goud that ye can gie. 13 ‘Whare will I get a bonny boy, That's willin to win meat and fee, Wha will gae on to Earl Crawford An see an's heart be fawn to me?’ 14 When he cam to the yates o Crawford, They were a' sitting down to dine: ‘How comes it now, ye Earl Crawford, Ye arena takin Lady Lillie hame?’ 15 ‘Ye may gae tell her Lady Lillie, And ye maun neither lee nor len, She may stay in her father's bowers, For she'll not enter my yates again.’ 16 When he cam back to her father's yates, He lichtit low down on his knee: ‘What news, what news, my bonny boy? What news, what news hae ye to me?’ 17 ‘I'm bidden tell you, Lady Lillie — I'm bidden neither to lee nor len — She may stay in her father's bowers, For she'll not enter my yates again.’ 18 She stretched out her lily hand, Says, ‘Adieu, adieu to ane and a! Adieu, adieu to Earl Crawford!’ Wi that her sair heart brak in twa. 19 Then dowie, dowie her father raise up, And dowie, dowie the black put on, And dowie, dowie he mounted the brown, And dowie, dowie sat thereon. 20 And dowie rade to the yates o Crawford, And when to Crawford's yates he came, They were a' dressd in the robes o scarlet, Just gaun to tak Lady Lillie hame. 21 ‘Ye may cast aff your robes o scarlet — I wyte they set you wondrous weel — And now put on the black sae dowie, And come and bury your Lady Lill.’ 22 He took his hat into his hand, And laid it low down by his knee: ‘An it be true that Lillie's dead, The sun shall nae mair shine on me.’ Earl Crawford EARL CRAWFORD—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 61. 1 O we were seven bonny sisters, As fair women as fair could be, And some got lairds, and some got lords, And some got knights o high degree: When I was married to Earl Crawford, This was the fate befell to me. 2 When we had been married for some time, We walked in our garden green, And aye he clappd his young son's head, And aye he made sae much o him. 3 I turnd me right and round about, And aye the blythe blink in my ee: ‘Ye think as much o your young son As ye do o my fair body. 4 ‘What need ye clap your young son's head? What need ye make so much o him? What need ye clap your young son's head? I'm sure ye gotna him your lane.’ 5 ‘O if I gotna him my lane, Show here the man that helpëd me; And for these words your ain mouth spoke Heir o my land he neer shall be.’ 6 He calld upon his stable-groom To come to him right speedilie: ‘Gae saddle a steed to Lady Crawford, Be sure ye do it hastilie. 7 ‘His bridle gilt wi gude red gowd, That it may glitter in her ee; And send her on to bonny Stobha, All her relations for to see.’ 8 Her mother lay oer the castle wa, And she beheld baith dale and down, And she beheld her Lady Crawford, As she came riding to the town. 9 ‘Come here, come here, my husband dear, This day ye see not what I see; For here there comes her Lady Crawford, Riding alane upon the lee.’ 10 When she came to her father's yates, She tirled gently at the pin: ‘If ye sleep, awake, my mother dear, Ye'll rise lat Lady Crawford in.’ 11 ‘What news, what news, ye Lady Crawford, That ye come here so hastilie?’ ‘Bad news, bad news, my mother dear, For my gude lord's forsaken me.’ 12 ‘O wae's me for you, Lady Crawford, This is a dowie tale to me; Alas! you were too young married To thole sic cross and misery.’ 13 ‘O had your tongue, my mother dear, And ye'll lat a' your folly be; It was a word my merry mouth spake That sinderd my gude lord and me.’ 14 Out it spake her brither then, Aye as he stept ben the floor: ‘My sister Lillie was but eighteen years When Earl Crawford ca'ed her a whore. 15 ‘But had your tongue, my sister dear, And ye'll lat a' your mourning bee; I'll wed you to as fine a knight, That is nine times as rich as hee.’ 16 ‘O had your tongue, my brither dear, And ye'll lat a' your folly bee; I'd rather yae kiss o Crawford's mouth Than a' his gowd and white monie. 17 ‘But saddle to me my riding-steed, And see him saddled speedilie, And I will on to Earl Crawford's, And see if he will pity me.’ 18 Earl Crawford lay o'er castle wa, And he beheld baith dale and down, And he beheld her Lady Crawford, As she came riding to the town. 19 He called ane o his livery men To come to him right speedilie: ‘Gae shut my yates, gae steek my doors, Keep Lady Crawford out frae me.’ 20 When she came to Earl Crawford's yates, She tirled gently at the pin: ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, Earl Crawford, Ye'll open, lat Lady Crawford in. 21 ‘Come down, come down, O Earl Crawford, And speak some comfort unto me; And if ye winna come yoursell, Ye'll send your gentleman to me.’ 22 ‘Indeed I winna come mysell, Nor send my gentleman to thee; For I tauld you when we did part Nae mair my spouse ye'd ever bee.’ 23 She laid her mouth then to the yates, And aye the tears drapt frae her ee; Says, Fare ye well, Earl Crawford's yates, You again I'll nae mair see. 24 Earl Crawford calld on his stable-groom To come to him right speedilie, And sae did he his waiting-man, That did attend his fair bodie. 25 ‘Ye will gae saddle for me my steed, And see and saddle him speedilie, And I'll gang to the Lady Crawford, And see if she will pity me.’ 26 Lady Crawford lay oer castle-wa, And she beheld baith dale and down, And she beheld him Earl Crawford, As he came riding to the town. 27 Then she has calld ane o her maids To come to her right speedilie: ‘Gae shut my yates, gae steek my doors, Keep Earl Crawford out frae me.’ 28 When he came to Lady Crawford's yates, He tirled gently at the pin: ‘Sleep ye, wake ye, Lady Crawford, Ye'll rise and lat Earl Crawford in. 29 ‘Come down, come down, O Lady Crawford, Come down, come down, and speak wi me; And gin ye winna come yoursell, Ye'll send your waiting-maid to me.’ 30 ‘Indeed I winna come mysell, Nor send my waiting-maid to thee; Sae take your ain words hame again At Crawford castle ye tauld me. 31 ‘O mother dear, gae make my bed, And ye will make it saft and soun, And turn my face unto the west, That I nae mair may see the sun.’ 32 Her mother she did make her bed, And she did make it saft and soun; True were the words fair Lillie spake, Her lovely eyes neer saw the sun. 33 The Earl Crawford mounted his steed, Wi sorrows great he did ride hame; But ere the morning sun appeard This fine lord was dead and gane. 34 Then on ae night this couple died, And baith were buried in ae tomb: Let this a warning be to all, Their pride may not bring them low down. 230 THE SLAUGHTER OF THE LAIRD OF MELLERSTAIN THE SLAUGHTER OF THE LAIRD OF MELLERSTAIN In a folio volume with the title “Miscellanies,” the last piece in the volume, Abbotsford. 1 As they came in by the Eden side, They heard a lady lamenting sair, Bewailing the time she was a bride. 2 A stately youth of blude and lane, John Hately, the laird of Mellerstain. 3 ‘Cowdenknows, had ye nae lack? And Earlstoun, had ye nae shame? Ye took him away beside my back, But ye never saw to bring him hame.’ 4 And she has lookit to Fieldiesha, So has she through Yirdandstane; She lookit to Earlstoun, and she saw the Fans, But he's coming hame by West Gordon. 5 And she staggerd and she stood, 6 ‘ wude; How can I keep in my wits, When I look on my husband's blood?’ 7 ‘Had we been men as we are women, And been at his back when he was slain, It should a been tauld for mony a lang year, The slaughter o the laird of Mellerstain.’ 231 THE EARL OF ERROL Kate Carnegie THE EARL OF ERROL—A a. Campbell MSS., II, 94. b. The Edinburgh Magazine, or Literary Miscellany, June, 1803, p. 458. 1 There was a jury sat at Perth, In the merry month of May, Betwixt the noble Duke of Perth But and Sir Gilbert Hay. 2 My lord Kingside has two daughters, They are proper, straight and tall; But my lord Carnegie he has two That far excells them all. 3 Then Errol he has dressd him, As very well he could; I'm sure there was not one cloth-yard But what was trimmd with gold. 4 ‘Ane asking, ane asking, my lord Carnegie, Ane asking I've to thee; I'm come to court your daughter Jean, My wedded wife to be.’ 5 ‘My daughter Jean was wed yestreen, To one of high degree, But where Jean got one guinea of gold With Kate I'll give thee three. 6 ‘Full fifteen hundred pounds Had Jean Carnegie, But three fifteen hundred pounds With Kate I'll gie to thee.’ 7 Then Errol he has wed her, And fairly brought her hame; There was nae peace between them twa Till they sundered oer again. 8 When bells were rung, and mess was sung, And a' man bound to bed, The Earl of Errol and his countess In one chamber was laid. 9 Early in the morning My lord Carnegie rose, The Earl of Errol and his countess, And they've put on their clothes. 10 Up spake my lord Carnegie; ‘Kate, is your toucher won?’ ‘Ye may ask the Earl of Errol, If he be your good-son. 11 ‘What need I wash my petticoat And hing it on a pin? For I am as leal a maid yet As yestreen when I lay down. 12 ‘What need I wash my apron And hing it on the door? It's baith side and wide enough, Hangs even down before.’ 13 Up spake my lord Carnegie; ‘O Kate, what do ye think? We'll beguile the Earl of Errol As lang as he's in drink.’ 14 ‘O what will ye beguile him wi? Or what will ye do than? I'll swear before a justice-court That he's no a sufficient man. 15 Then Errol he cam down the stair, As bold as oney rae: ‘Go saddle to me my Irish coach, To Edinbro I'll go.’ 16 When he came to Edinbro, He lighted on the green; There were four-and-twenty maidens A' dancing in a ring. 17 There were four-and-twenty maidens A' dancing in a row; The fatest and the fairest To bed wi him must go. 18 He's taen his Peggy by the hand, And he led her thro the green, And twenty times he kissd her there, Before his ain wife's een. 19 He's taen his Peggy by the hand, And he's led her thro the hall, And twenty times he's kissd her there, Before his nobles all. 20 ‘Look up, look up, my Peggy lass, Look up, and think nae shame; Ten hundred pounds I'll gie to you To bear to me a son.’ 21 He's keepit his Peggy in his room Three quarter of a year, And just at the nine months' end She a son to him did bear. 22 ‘Now if ye be Kate Carnegie, And I Sir Gilbert Hay, I'll make your father sell his lands Your toucher for to pay.’ 23 ‘To make my father sell his lands, It wad be a great sin, To toucher oney John Sheephead That canna toucher win.’ 24 ‘Now hold your tongue, ye whorish bitch, Sae loud as I hear ye lie! For yonder sits Lord Errol's son, Upon his mother's knee; For yonder sits Lord Errol's son, Altho he's no by thee.’ 25 ‘You may take hame your daughter Kate, And set her on the glen; For Errol canna please her, Nor nane o Errol's men; For Errol canna please her, Nor twenty of his men.’ 26 The ranting and the roving, The thing we a' do ken, The lady lost her right that night, The first night she lay down; And the thing we ca the ranting o't, The lady lies her lane.

I wad kiss it, and I wad clap it, And daut it for Andrew Lammie. 3 ‘The first time me and my love met Was in the woods of Fyvie; He kissed my lips five thousand times, And ay he ca'd me bonny, And a' the answer he gat frae me, Was, My bonny Andrew Lammie!’ 4 ‘Love, I maun gang to Edinburgh; Love, I maun gang and leave thee!’ ‘I sighed right sair, and said nae mair But, O gin I were wi ye!’ 5 ‘But true and trusty will I be, As I am Andrew Lammie; I'll never kiss a woman's mouth Till I come back and see thee.’ 6 ‘And true and trusty will I be, As I am Tiftie's Annie; I'll never kiss a man again Till ye come back and see me.’ 7 Syne he's come back frae Edinburgh To the bonny hows o Fyvie, And ay his face to the nor-east, To look for Tiftie's Annie. 8 ‘I hae a love in Edinburgh, Sae hae I intill Leith, man; I hae a love intill Montrose, Sae hae I in Dalkeith, man. 9 ‘And east and west, whereer I go, My love she's always wi me; For east and west, whereer I go, My love she dwells in Fyvie. 10 ‘My love possesses a' my heart, Nae pen can eer indite her; She's ay sae stately as she goes That I see nae mae like her. 11 ‘But Tiftie winna gie consent His dochter me to marry, Because she has five thousand marks, And I have not a penny. 12 ‘Love pines away, love dwines away, Love, love decays the body; For love o thee, oh I must die; Adieu, my bonny Annie!’ 13 Her mither raise out o her bed, And ca'd on baith her women: ‘What ails ye, Annie, my dochter dear? O Annie, was ye dreamin? 14 ‘What dule disturbd my dochter's sleep? O tell to me, my Annie!’ She sighed right sair, and said nae mair But, O for Andrew Lammie! 15 Her father beat her cruellie, Sae also did her mother; Her sisters sair did scoff at her; But wae betide her brother! 16 Her brother beat her cruellie, Till his straiks they werena canny; He brak her back, and he beat her sides, For the sake o Andrew Lammie. 17 ‘O fie, O fie, my brother dear! The gentlemen'll shame ye; The Laird o Fyvie he's gaun by, And he'll come in and see me. 18 ‘And he'll kiss me, and he'll clap me, And he will speer what ails me; And I will answer him again, It's a' for Andrew Lammie.’ 19 Her sisters they stood in the door, Sair grievd her wi their folly: ‘O sister dear, come to the door, Your cow is lowin on you.’ 20 ‘O fie, O fie, my sister dear! Grieve me not wi your folly; I'd rather hear the trumpet sound Than a' the kye o Fyvie. 21 ‘Love pines away, love dwines away, Love, love decays the body; For love o thee now I maun die; Adieu to Andrew Lammie!’ 22 But Tiftie's wrote a braid letter, And sent it into Fyvie, Saying his daughter was bewitchd By bonny Andrew Lammie. 23 ‘Now, Tiftie, ye maun gie consent, And lat the lassie marry;’ ‘I'll never, never gie consent To the trumpeter of Fyvie.’ 24 When Fyvie looked the letter on, He was baith sad and sorry: Says, The bonniest lass o the country-side Has died for Andrew Lammie. 25 O Andrew's gane to the house-top O the bonny house o Fyvie, He's blawn his horn baith loud and shill Oer the lawland leas o Fyvie. 26 ‘Mony a time hae I walkd a' night, And never yet was weary; But now I may walk wae my lane, For I'll never see my deary. 27 ‘Love pines away, love dwines away, Love, love decays the body; For the love o thee now I maun die; I come, my bonny Annie!’ Tifty's Nanny ANDREW LAMMIE—B Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 382; “from a stall copy, procured from Scotland.” 1 ‘There springs a rose in Fyvie's yard, And O but it springs bonny! There's a daisy in the middle of it, Its name is Andrew Lammie. 2 ‘I wish the rose were in my breast, For the love I bear the daisy; So blyth and merry as I would be, And kiss my Andrew Lammie. 3 ‘The first time I and my love met Was in the wood of Fyvie; He kissëd and he dawted me, Calld me his bonny Annie. 4 ‘Wi apples sweet he did me treat, Which stole my heart so canny, And ay sinsyne himself was kind, My bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 5 ‘But I am going to Edinburgh, My love, I'm going to leave thee;’ She sighd full sore, and said no more, ‘I wish I were but wi you.’ 6 ‘I will buy thee a wedding-gown, My love, I'll buy it bonny;’ ‘But I'll be dead or ye come back, My bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 7 ‘I will buy you brave bridal shoes, My love, I'll buy them bonny;’ ‘But I'll be dead or ye come back, My bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 8 ‘If you'll be true and trusty too, As I am Andrew Lammie, That you will neer kiss lad nor lown Till I return to Fyvie.’ 9 ‘I shall be true and trusty too, As my name's Tifty's Nanny, That I'll kiss neither lad nor lown Till you return to Fyvie.’— 10 ‘Love pines awa, love dwines awa, Love pines awa my body; And love's crept in at my bed-foot, And taen possession o me. 11 ‘My father drags me by the hair, My mother sore does scold me; And they would give one hundred merks, To any one to wed me. 12 ‘My sister stands at her bower-door, And she full sore does mock me, And when she hears the trumpet sound,— “Your cow is lowing, Nanny!” 13 ‘O be still, my sister Jane, And leave off all your folly; For I'd rather hear that cow low Than all the kye in Fyvie. 14 ‘My father locks the door at night, Lays up the keys fu canny, And when he hears the trumpet sound,— “Your cow is lowing, Nanny!” 15 ‘O hold your tongue, my father dear, And let be a' your folly; For I would rather hear that cow Than all the kye in Fyvie.’ 16 ‘If you ding me, I will greet, And gentlemen will hear me; Laird Fyvie will be coming by, And he'll come in and see me.’ 17 ‘Yea, I will ding you though ye greet And gentlemen should hear you; Though Laird Fyvie were coming by, And did come in and see you.’ 18 So they dang her, and she grat, And gentlemen did hear her, And Fyvie he was coming by, And did come in to see her. 19 ‘Mill of Tifty, give consent, And let your daughter marry; If she were full of as high blood As she is full of beauty, I would take her to myself, And make her my own lady.’ 20 ‘Fyvie lands ly broad and wide, And O but they ly bonny! But I would not give my own true-love For all the lands in Fyvie. 21 ‘But make my bed, and lay me down, And turn my face to Fyvie, That I may see before I die My bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 22 They made her bed, and laid her down, And turnd her face to Fyvie; She gave a groan, and died or morn, So neer saw Andrew Lammie. 23 Her father sorely did lament The loss of his dear Nannie, And wishd that he had gien consent To wed with Andrew Lammie. 24 But ah! alas! it was too late, For he could not recall her; Through time unhappy is his fate, Because he did controul her. 25 You parents grave who children have, In crushing them be canny, Lest for their part they break their heart, As did young Tifty's Nanny.

She durst not own her heart was won By the trumpeter of Fyvie. 8 At night when all went to their bed, All slept full soon but Annie; Love so oppresst her tender breast, Thinking on Andrew Lammie. 9 ‘Love comes in at my bed-side, And love lies down beyond me; Love has possest my tender breast, And love will waste my body. 10 ‘The first time me and my love met Was in the woods of Fyvie; His lovely form and speech so soft Soon gaind the heart of Annie. 11 ‘He called me mistress; I said, No, I'm Tifty's bonny Annie; With apples sweet he did me treat, And kisses soft and mony. 12 ‘It's up and down in Tifty's den, Where the burn runs clear and bonny, I've often gane to meet my love, My bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 13 But now alas! her father heard That the trumpeter of Fyvie Had had the art to gain the heart Of Mill of Tifty's Annie. 14 Her father soon a letter wrote, And sent it on to Fyvie, To tell his daughter was bewitchd By his servant, Andrew Lammie. 15 Then up the stair his trumpeter He callëd soon and shortly: ‘Pray tell me soon what's this you've done To Tifty's bonny Annie.’ 16 ‘Woe be to Mill of Tifty's pride, For it has ruined many; They'll not have't said that she should wed The trumpeter of Fyvie. 17 ‘In wicked art I had no part, Nor therein am I canny; True love alone the heart has won Of Tifty's bonny Annie. 18 ‘Where will I find a boy so kind That will carry a letter canny, Who will run to Tifty's town, Give it to my love Annie? 19 ‘Tifty he has daughters three Who all are wonderous bonny; But ye'll ken her oer a' the rest; Give that to bonny Annie. 20 ‘It's up and down in Tifty's den, Where the burn runs clear and bonny, There wilt thou come and I'll attend; My love, I long to see thee. 21 ‘Thou mayst come to the brig of Slugh, And there I'll come and meet thee; It's there we will renew our love, Before I go and leave you. 22 ‘My love, I go to Edinburgh town, And for a while must leave thee;’ She sighëd sore, and said no more But ‘I wish that I were with you!’ 23 ‘I'll buy to thee a bridal gown, My love, I'll buy it bonny;’ ‘But I'll be dead ere ye come back To see your bonny Annie.’ 24 ‘If ye'll be true and constant too, As I am Andrew Lammie, I shall thee wed when I come back To see the lands of Fyvie.’ 25 ‘I will be true and constant too To thee, my Andrew Lammie, But my bridal bed or then'll be made In the green church-yard of Fyvie.’ 26 ‘The time is gone, and now comes on My dear, that I must leave thee; If longer here I should appear, Mill of Tifty he would see me.’ 27 ‘I now for ever bid adieu To thee, my Andrew Lammie; Or ye come back I will be laid In the green church-yard of Fyvie.’ 28 He hied him to the head of the house, To the house-top of Fyvie, He blew his trumpet loud and shrill, It was heard at Mill of Tifty. 29 Her father lockd the door at night, Laid by the keys fu canny, And when he heard the trumpet sound Said, Your cow is lowing, Annie. 30 ‘My father dear, I pray forbear, And reproach not your Annie; I'd rather hear that cow to low Than all the kye in Fyvie. 31 ‘I would not for my braw new gown, And all your gifts so many, That it was told in Fyvie land How cruel ye are to Annie. 32 ‘But if ye strike me I will cry, And gentlemen will hear me; Lord Fyvie will be riding by, And he'll come in and see me.’ 33 At the same time the lord came in; He said, What ails thee Annie? ‘It's all for love now I must die, For bonny Andrew Lammie.’ 34 ‘Pray, Mill of Tifty, give consent, And let your daughter marry;’ ‘It will be with some higher match Than the trumpeter of Fyvie.’ 35 ‘If she were come of as high a kind As she's advanced in beauty, I would take her unto myself, And make her my own lady.’ 36 ‘Fyvie lands are far and wide, And they are wonderous bonny; But I would not leave my own true-love For all the lands in Fyvie.’ 37 Her father struck her wonderous sore, As also did her mother; Her sisters also did her scorn, But woe be to her brother! 38 Her brother struck her wonderous sore, With cruel strokes and many; He broke her back in the hall-door, For liking Andrew Lammie. 39 ‘Alas! my father and my mother dear, Why so cruel to your Annie? My heart was broken first by love, My brother has broke my body. 40 ‘O mother dear, make me my bed, And lay my face to Fyvie; Thus will I lie, and thus will die For my dear Andrew Lammie. 41 ‘Ye neighbours hear, baith far and near, And pity Tifty's Annie, Who dies for love of one poor lad, For bonny Andrew Lammie. 42 ‘No kind of vice eer staind my life, Or hurt my virgin honour; My youthful heart was won by love, But death will me exoner.’ 43 Her mother than she made her bed, And laid her face to Fyvie; Her tender heart it soon did break, And never saw Andrew Lammie. 44 Lord Fyvie he did wring his hands, Said, Alas for Tifty's Annie! The fairest flower's cut down by love That ever sprang in Fyvie. 45 ‘Woe be to Mill of Tifty's pride! He might have let them marry; I should have given them both to live Into the lands of Fyvie.’ 46 Her father sorely now laments The loss of his dear Annie, And wishes he had given consent To wed with Andrew Lammie. 47 When Andrew home frae Edinburgh came, With muckle grief and sorrow, ‘My love is dead for me to-day, I'll die for her to-morrow. 48 ‘Now I will run to Tifty's den, Where the burn runs clear and bonny; With tears I'll view the brig of Slugh, Where I parted from my Annie. 49 ‘Then will I speed to the green kirk-yard, To the green kirk-yard of Fyvie, With tears I'll water my love's grave, Till I follow Tifty's Annie.’ 234 CHARLIE MAC PHERSON Charlie MacPherson CHARLIE MAC PHERSON—A Harris MS., fol. 23 b; from Mrs Harris's singing. 1 Charlie MacPherson, that braw Hieland lad[die], On Valentine's even cam doun to Kinaltie, Courtit Burd Hellen, baith wakin an sleepin: ‘Oh, fair fa them has my love in keepin!’ 2 Charlie MacPherson cam doun the dykeside, Baith Milton an Muirton an a' bein his guide; Baith Milton an Muirton an auld Water Nairn, A' gaed wi him, for to be his warn. 3 Whan he cam to the hoose o Kinaltie, ‘Open your yetts, mistress, an lat us come in!

Where is your sister now? Where is your sister, maidens, That she is not walking with you?’ 7 ‘O pardon us, honoured father, O pardon us,’ they did say; ‘Lady Jean is with Captain Ogilvie, And away with him she will gae.’ 8 When he came to Aberdeen, And down upon the green, There did he see Captain Ogilvie, Training up his men. 9 ‘O wo to you, Captain Ogilvie, And an ill death thou shalt die; For taking to thee my daughter, Hangëd thou shalt be.’ 10 Duke Gordon has wrote a broad letter, And sent it to the king, To cause hang Captain Ogilvie If ever he hanged a man. 11 ‘I will not hang Captain Ogilvie, For no lord that I see; But I'll cause him to put off the lace and scarlet, And put on the single livery.’ 12 Word came to Captain Ogilvie, In the chamber where he lay, To cast off the gold lace and scarlet, And put on the single livery. 13 ‘If this be for bonny Jeany Gordon, This pennance I'll take wi; If this be for bonny Jeany Gordon, All this I will dree.’ 14 Lady Jean had not been married, Not a year but three, Till she had a babe in every arm, Another upon her knee. 15 ‘O but I'm weary of wandering! O but my fortune is bad! It sets not the Duke of Gordon's daughter To follow a soldier-lad. 16 ‘O but I'm weary of wandering! O but I think lang! It sets not the Duke of Gordon's daughter To follow a single man.’ 17 When they came to the Highland hills, Cold was the frost and snow; Lady Jean's shoes they were all torn, No farther could she go. 18 ‘O wo to the hills and the mountains! Wo to the wind and the rain! My feet is sore with going barefoot, No further am I able to gang. 19 ‘Wo to the hills and the mountains! Wo to the frost and the snow! My feet is sore with going barefoot, No farther am I able for to go. 20 ‘O if I were at the glens of Foudlen, Where hunting I have been, I would find the way to bonny Castle Gordon, Without either stockings or shoon.’ 21 When she came to Castle Gordon, And down upon the green, The porter gave out a loud shout, ‘O yonder comes Lady Jean!’ 22 ‘O you are welcome, bonny Jeany Gordon, You are dear welcome to me; You are welcome, dear Jeany Gordon, But away with your Captain Ogilvie.’ 23 Now over seas went the captain, As a soldier under command; A message soon followed after To come and heir his brother's land. 24 ‘Come home, you pretty Captain Ogilvie, And heir your brother's land; Come home, ye pretty Captain Ogilvie, Be Earl of Northumberland.’ 25 ‘O what does this mean?’ says the captain; ‘Where's my brother's children three?’ ‘They are dead and buried, And the lands they are ready for thee.’ 26 ‘Then hoist up your sails, brave captain, Let's be jovial and free; I'll to Northumberland and heir my estate, Then my dear Jeany I'll see.’ 27 He soon came to Castle Gordon, And down upon the green; The porter gave out with a loud shout, ‘Here comes Captain Ogilvie!’ 28 ‘You're welcome, pretty Captain Ogilvie, Your fortune's advanced I hear; No stranger can come unto my gates That I do love so dear.’ 29 ‘Sir, the last time I was at your gates, You would not let me in; I'm come for my wife and children, No friendship else I claim.’ 30 ‘Come in, pretty Captain Ogilvie, And drink of the beer and the wine; And thou shalt have gold and silver To count till the clock strike nine.’ 31 ‘I'll have none of your gold or silver, Nor none of your white-money; But I'll have bonny Jeany Gordon, And she shall go now with me.’ 32 Then she came tripping down the stair, With the tear into her eye; One babe was at her foot, Another upon her knee. 33 ‘You're welcome, bonny Jeany Gordon, With my young family; Mount and go to Northumberland, There a countess thou shall be.’ 238 GLENLOGIE, OR, JEAN O BETHELNIE GLENLOGIE, OR, JEAN O BETHELNIE—A Skene MS., p. 13; taken down from recitation in the north of Scotland, 1802-3. 1 Four an twenty noblemen they rode thro Banchory fair, But bonnie Glenlogie was flower [of a'] that was there. 2 Four and twenty noblemen rode from Banchory ha, But bonnie Glenlogie he was flower of them a'. 3 ‘O bonnie Glenlogie, be constant and kind, An, bonnie Glenlogie, I'll tell you my mind. 4 so frank and so free, and I get na Glenlogie, I'll die.’ 5 ‘O bonnie Jeanie, your portion's but sma To lay your love on me, that's promist awa.’ 6 Her cherry cheeks grew pale an wan; with the tear in her ee, ‘Gin I get na Glenlogie, I surely will die.’ 7 Ben came her father, steps to her bowr: ‘Dear Jeanie, you'r acting the part of a [whore]. 8 ‘You're seeking ane that cares na for thee; Ye's get Lord William, let Glenlogie be.’ 9 ‘O had you still, father, let your folly be; Gin I get na Glenlogie, I surely will die.’ 10 Ben came her mother, steps on the floor: ‘Dear daughter Jeanie, you're acting the [whore], 11 ‘Seeking of ane that cares na for thee; For ye'll get Lord William, let Glenlogie be.’ 12 ‘O had your tongue, mother, and let me be; An I get na Glenlogie, I surely will die.’ 13 O ben came her father's chaplain, a man of great skill, And he has written a broad letter, and he has pennd it well. 14 H'as pennd it well, an sent it awa To bonnie Glenlogie, the flower of them a'. 15 When he got the letter, his tears did down fa ‘She's laid her love on me, that was promist awa.’ 16 He calld on his servant wi speed, and bade him saddle his horses, and bridle them a': ‘For she has laid her love on me, altho I was promist awa.’ 17 The horses were saddled wi speed, but ere they came he was four mile awa, To Jean of Bethelny, the flowr of them a'. 18 But when he came to her bowr she was pale and wan, But she grew red and ruddy when Glenlogie came in. 19 ‘Cheer up, bonnie Jeannie, ye are flowr o them a'; I have laid my love on you, altho I was promist awa.’ 20 Her beauty was charming, her tocher down tauld; Bonnie Jean of Bethelny was scarce fifteen year auld.

A maid's love laid on you, shall she die in her woe? 19 Then reading the letter, his heart was like to break That such a leal virgin should die for his sake. 20 Then he calld on his footman, and likewise his groom, Says, Get my horse saddled and bridlëd soon. 21 Before the horse was saddled and brought to the yate, Bonnie Glenlogie was five miles on foot. 22 When he came to Bethelnie, he saw nothing there But weeping and wailing, vexation and care. 23 Then out spake her father, with the tear in his ee, You're welcome, Glenlogie, you're welcome to me. 24 ‘If ye make me welcome, as welcome's ye say, Ye'll show me the chamber where Jeannie does lay.’ 25 Then one o her maidens took him by the hand, To show him the chamber where Jeannie lay in. 26 Before that she saw him, she was pale and wan; But when she did see him, she grew ruddy again. 27 ‘O turn, bonny Jeannie, turn you to your side; For I'll be the bridegroom, and ye'll be the bride.’ 28 When Jeannie was married, her tocher down tauld, Bonny Jean o Bethelnie was fifteen years auld. Jean o Bethelnie GLENLOGIE, OR, JEAN O BETHELNIE—F Communicated to Percy by Robert Lambe, of Norham, August 17, 1768; dated April, 1768. 1 Fourscore nobles ride in the king's court, And bonny Earl Ogie's the flower of the rout; Fourscore lean oer the castle-wa, But Jean of Bethelnie's the flower of em a'. 2 She writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang, And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as't can gang: ‘Bonny Earl Ogie, be courteous and kind; I've laid my love on thee; maun I die in my prime?’ 3 ‘O pox on thee, Jenny, for being sae slaw! Bonny Earl Ogie is promisd awa:’ This letter was like to mak her heart break, For revealing her mind to a man so ingrate. 4 ‘Come here, all my handmaids, O do this with speed, Take my gowns and my passments, and lay me to bed; Lay me to my bed, it is all that I crave; Wi my sark in my coffin, lay me in my grave.’ 5 Her father beheld her with heart full of grief, And spoke these words to her, to gi her relief: Hawd your tongue, Jenny, your mourning let be, You shall have Drumfinely, who's as good as he. 6 ‘Haud your tongue, father, your words make me sad; If I get not Earl Ogie, I still shall be bad; With his bonny streight body, and black rolling eee, If I get not Earl Ogie, for him I mun dee.’ 7 Her father, king's chaplain, and one of great skill, Did write a broad letter, and pennd it fou weel; He as writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang, And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as't can gang. 8 ‘Bonny Earl Ogie, be courteous and kind; My daughter loves you; must she die in her prime?’ When he read the first lines, a loud laugh gave he; But or he redd the middle, the tear filld his ee. 9 ‘Come here, all my footmen, and also my groom, Go saddle my horses, and saddle them soon:’ They were not weel saddled and set on the green Or bonny Earl Ogie was twa mile his lain. 10 When he came to Bethelnie, he nothing saw there But mourning and weeping, lamentation and care: ‘O you that's her handmaid, take me by the hand, Lead me to the chamber that Jenny lies in.’ 11 When thither he came, she was pale and half dead; As soon as she saw him, her cheeks they grew red: ‘Come, turn thee, my Jenny, come, turn on thy side, I'll be the bridegroom, you shall be the bride.’ 12 Her spirit revived to hear him say sae, And thus ended luckily all her great wae; Then streight were they married, with joy most profound, And Jean of Bethelnie was sav'd from the ground.

Oh, Logie!’ said she, ‘Gin I get na Glenlogie, I'm sure I will die.’ 5 ‘O hold your tongue, daughter, an weep na sae sair, For ye'll get Drumfindlay, his father's young heir.’ ‘O hold your tongue, father, an let me alane, Gin I get na Glenlogie, I winna hae ane.’ 6 Her father wrote a broad letter wi speed, And ordered his footman to run and ride; He wrote a broad letter, he wrote it wi skill, An sent it to Glenlogie, who had dune her the ill. 7 The first line that he read, a light laugh gae he; The next line that he read, the tear filld his ee: ‘O what a man am I, an hae I a maik, That such a fine ladye shoud die for my sake? 8 ‘Ye'll saddle my horse, an ye'll saddle him sune, An, when he is saddled, bring him to the green:’ His horse was na saddled an brocht to the green, When Glenlogie was on the road three miles his lane. 9 When he came to her father's, he saw naething there But weeping an wailing an sobbing fu sair: O pale an wan was she when Logie gaed in, But red an ruddie grew she when Logie gaed ben. 10 ‘O turn, Ladye Jeany, turn ye to your side, For I'll be the bridegroom, an ye'll be the bride:’ It was a blythe wedding as ever I've seen, An bonny Jeany Melville was scarce seventeen. Glenlogie GLENLOGIE, OR, JEAN O BETHELNIE—H Kinloch MSS, V, 431; in Kinloch's hand. 1 Six and six nobles gaed to Belhelvie fair, But bonnie Glenlogie was flowr o a' there; Bonnie Jean o Behelvie gaed tripping doun the stair, And fancied Glenlogie afore a' that was there. 2 She said to his serving-man, as he stood aside, O what is that man's name, and whare does he bide? ‘They call him Glenlogie whan he goes frae home, But he's come o the grand Gordons, and [h]is name is Lord John.’ 3 ‘Glenlogie, Glenlogie, be constant and kind; I've laid my love on you, I'll tell you my mind:’ ‘O wae's me heart, Jeanie, your tocher's oure sma; Lay na your love on me, for I'm promised awa.’ 4 She called for the servant to show her a room, Likewise for a handmaid to mak her bed doun; Wi that Jeanie's father cam stepping on the floor, Says, What is the matter my dochter lies here? 5 ‘Forgie, honourd father, my folly,’ said she, ‘But for the sake o Glenlogie your dochter will dee:’ ‘O cheer up, my dochter, for I'll gie ye my hand That ye'se get young Glenforbar, w'an earldom of land. 6 ‘O cheer up, my dochter, turn ance frae the wa, And ye'll get Glenforbar, the flowr o them a':’ ‘I wad rather tak Glenlogie wi his staff in his hand Afore I wad tak Glenforbar wi an earldom of land.’ 7 Jeanie's father was a scholar, and a man o grit wit, And he wrote him a letter, he thought it was fit. 8 When Glenlogie gat the letter, he was amang nobles a', he lute his hat fa: ‘I wonder i the warld what women see at me, For bonnie Jean o Belhelvie is a dying for me:’ 9 He calld for his servant to saddle his steed, wi speed; The horse was na saddled, but out on the green, Till bonnie Glenlogie was some miles him leen. 10 Whan he cam to Belhelvie, he rade round about, And he saw Jeanie's father at a window look out. 11 Bonnie Jean o Belhevie lay pale and wan, But red and ruddy grew she when Glenlogie cam in: ‘Lie yont, bonnie Jeanie, and let me lie down, For ye'se be bride, and I'se be bridegroom.’ Glenogie GLENLOGIE, OR, JEAN O BETHELNIE—I a. “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border-Minstrelsy,” No. 77.

The first ane line that he read, a low smile gave he; The next ane line that he read, the tear blinded his ee; But the next line that he read he garrd the table flee. 5 ‘O saddle to me the black horse, saddle to me the brown, Saddle to me the swiftest horse that eer rode frae the town:’ But lang or the horses could be brought to the green Bonie Glenlogie was twa mile his lean. 6 When he came to Glenfeldy's gates, little mirth was there, Bonie Jean's mother was tearing her hair: ‘You're welcome, Glenlogie, you're welcome to me, You're welcome, Glenlogie, your Jeanie to see.’ 7 O pale and wan was she when Logie came in, But red and rosy grew she wheneer he sat down: ‘O turn you, bonie Jeanie, O turn you to me, For, if you'll be the bride, the bridegroom I will be.’ 239 LORD SALTOUN AND AUCHANACHIE Lord Salton and Auchanachie LORD SALTOUN AND AUCHANACHIE—A a.

Salton's lands they lie broad, his towers they stand hie, Ye must marry Salton, leave Auchanachie. 4 ‘Salton will gar you wear silk gowns fring'd to thy knee, But ye'll never wear that wi your love Auchanachie.’ 5 ‘Wi Auchanachie Gordon I would beg my bread Before that wi Salton I'd wear gowd on my head, Wear gowd on my head, or gowns fring'd to the knee; And I'll die if I getna my love Auchanachie. 6 ‘O Salton's [a] valley lies low by the sea, He's bowed on the back, and thrawin on the knee;’ 7 ‘O Salton's a valley lies low by the sea; Though he's bowed on the back and thrawin on the knee, Though he's bowed on the back and thrawin on the knee, The bonny rigs of Salton they're nae thrawin tee.’ 8 ‘O you that are my parents to church may me bring, But unto young Salton I'll never bear a son; For son or for daughter, I'll ne'er bow my knee, And I'll die if I getna my love Auchanachie.’ 9 When Jeanie was married, from church was brought hame, When she wi her maidens sae merry shoud hae been, When she wi her maidens sae merry shoud hae been, She's called for a chamber, to weep there her lane. 10 ‘Come to your bed, Jeanie, my honey and my sweet, For to stile you mistress I do not think it meet:’ ‘Mistress or Jeanie, it is a' ane to me, It's in your bed, Salton, I never will be.’ 11 Then out spake her father, he spake wi renown; Some of you that are maidens, ye'll loose aff her gown; Some of you that are maidens, ye'll loose aff her gown, And I'll mend the marriage wi ten thousand crowns. 12 Then ane of her maidens they loosed aff her gown, But bonny Jeanie Gordon she fell in a swoon; She fell in a swoon low down by their knee; Says, Look on, I die for my love Auchanachie! 13 That very same day Miss Jeanie did die, And hame came Auchanachie, hame frae the sea; Her father and mither welcomd him at the gate; He said, Where's Miss Jeanie, that she's nae here yet? 14 Then forth came her maidens, all wringing their hands, Saying, Alas for your staying sae lang frae the land! Sae lang frae the land, and sae lang on the fleed! They've wedded your Jeanie, and now she is dead. 15 ‘Some of you, her maidens, take me by the hand, And show me the chamber Miss Jeanie died in;’ He kissd her cold lips, which were colder than stane, And he died in the chamber that Jeanie died in.

Or is he but a caddie? Or is it the young Earl o Aboyne That ye ca your rantin laddie?’ 7 ‘He is a young and noble lord, He never was a caddie; It is the noble Earl o Aboyne That I ca my rantin laddie.’ 8 ‘Ye shall hae a horse at your command, As ye had often many, To go to the Castle o Aboyne, Wi a letter to your rantin laddie. 9 ‘Where will I get a little page, Where will I get a caddie, That will run quick to bonny Aboyne, Wi this letter to my rantin laddie?’ 10 Then out spoke the young scullion-boy, Said, Here am I, a caddie; I will run on to bonny Aboyne, Wi the letter to your rantin laddie. 11 ‘Now when ye come to bonny Deeside, Where woods are green and bonny, There will ye see the Earl o Aboyne, Among the bushes mony. 12 ‘And when ye come to the lands o Aboyne, Where all around is bonny, Ye'll take your hat into your hand, Gie this letter to my rantin laddie.’ 13 When he came near the banks of Dee, The birks were blooming bonny, And there he saw the Earl o Aboyne, Among the bushes mony. 14 ‘Where are ye going, my bonny boy? Where are ye going, my caddie?’ ‘I am going to the Castle o Aboyne, Wi a letter to the rantin laddie.’ 15 ‘See yonder is the castle then, My young and handsome caddie, And I myself am the Earl o Aboyne, Tho they ca me the rantin laddie.’ 16 ‘O pardon, my lord, if I've done wrong; Forgive a simple caddie; O pardon, pardon, Earl o Aboyne, I said but what she bade me.’ 17 ‘Ye have done no wrong, my bonny boy, Ye've done no wrong, my caddie;’ Wi hat in hand he bowed low, Gave the letter to the rantin laddie. 18 When young Aboyne looked the letter on, O but he blinkit bonny!

Communicated to Motherwell by William George, tenant in Cambus Michael, Perthshire, who took it from the recitation of an old woman. 1 David Drummond's destinie, Gude man o appearance o Cargill; I wat his blude rins in the flude, Sae sair against his parents' will. 2 She was the lass o Balathy toun, And he the butler o Stobhall, And mony a time she wauked late To bore the coble o Cargill. 3 His bed was made in Kercock ha, Of gude clean sheets and of [the] hay; He wudna rest ae nicht therein, But on the prude waters he wud gae. 4 His bed was made in Balathy toun, Of the clean sheets and of the strae; But I wat it was far better made Into the bottom o bonnie Tay. 5 She bored the coble in seven pairts, I wat her heart might hae been fu sair; For there she got the bonnie lad lost Wi the curly locks and the yellow hair. 6 He put his foot into the boat, He little thocht o ony ill; But before that he was mid-waters, The weary coble began to fill. 7 ‘Woe be to the lass o Balathy toun, I wat an ill death may she die! For she bored the coble in seven pairts, And let the waters perish me. 8 ‘Oh, help, oh help, I can get nane, Nae help o man can to me come!’ This was about his dying words, When he was choaked up to the chin. 9 ‘Gae tell my father and my mother It was naebody did me this ill; I was a-going my ain errands, Lost at the coble o bonnie Cargill.’ 10 She bored the boat in seven pairts, I wat she bored it wi gude will; And there they got the bonnie lad's corpse, In the kirk-shot o bonnie Cargill. 11 Oh a' the keys o bonnie Stobha I wat they at his belt did hing; But a' the keys of bonnie Stobha They now ly low into the stream. 12 A braver page into his age Neer set a foot upon the plain; His father to his mother said, ‘Oh, sae soon as we've wanted him! 13 ‘I wat they had mair luve than this When they were young and at the scule; But for his sake she wauked late, And bored the coble o bonnie Cargill.’ 14 ‘There's neer a clean sark gae on my back, Nor yet a kame gae in my hair; There's neither coal nor candle-licht Shall shine in my bouir for evir mair. 15 ‘At kirk nor market I'se neer be at, Nor yet a blythe blink in my ee; There's neer a ane shall say to anither, That's the lassie gard the young man die. 16 ‘Between the yates o bonnie Stobha And the kirk-style o bonnie Cargill, There is mony a man and mother's son That was at my love's burial.’ 243 JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER) The Fair Maid of Bristol; or, Bateman; or, John True JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—A Pepys Ballads, IV, 101; from a copy in Percy's papers. 1 There dwelt a fair maid in the West, Of worthy birth and fame, Neer unto Plimouth, stately town, Jane Reynolds was her name. 2 This damsel dearly was belovd By many a proper youth, And what of her is to be said Is known for very truth. 3 Among the rest a seaman brave Unto her a wooing came; A comely proper youth he was, James Harris calld by name. 4 The maid and young man was agreed, As time did them allow, And to each other secretly They made a solemn vow, 5 That they would ever faithfull be Whilst Heaven afforded life; He was to be her husband kind, And she his faithfull wife. 6 A day appointed was also When they was to be married; But before these things were brought to pass Matters were strangely carried. 7 All you that faithfull lovers be Give ear and hearken well, And what of them became at last I will directly tell. 8 The young man he was prest to sea, And forcëd was to go; His sweet-heart she must stay behind, Whether she would or no. 9 And after he was from her gone She three years for him staid, Expecting of his comeing home, And kept herself a maid. 10 At last news came that he was dead Within a forraign land, And how that he was buried She well did understand, 11 For whose sweet sake the maiden she Lamented many a day, And never was she known at all The wanton for to play. 12 A carpenter that livd hard by, When he heard of the same, Like as the other had done before, To her a wooing came. 13 But when that he had gained her love They married were with speed, And four years space, being man and wife, They loveingly agreed. 14 Three pritty children in this time This loving couple had, Which made their father's heart rejoyce, And mother wondrous glad. 15 But as occasion servd, one time The good man took his way Some three days journey from his home, Intending not to stay. 16 But, whilst that he was gone away, A spirit in the night Came to the window of his wife, And did her sorely fright. 17 Which spirit spake like to a man, And unto her did say, ‘My dear and onely love,’ quoth he, ‘Prepare and come away. 18 ‘James Harris is my name,’ quoth he, ‘Whom thou didst love so dear, And I have traveld for thy sake At least this seven year. 19 ‘And now I am returnd again, To take thee to my wife, And thou with me shalt go to sea, To end all further strife.’ 20 ‘O tempt me not, sweet James,’ quoth she, ‘With thee away to go; If I should leave my children small, Alas! what would they do? 21 ‘My husband is a carpenter, A carpenter of great fame; I would not for five hundred pounds That he should know the same.’ 22 ‘I might have had a king's daughter, And she would have married me; But I forsook her golden crown, And for the love of thee. 23 ‘Therefore, if thou'lt thy husband forsake, And thy children three also, I will forgive the[e] what is past, If thou wilt with me go.’ 24 ‘If I forsake my husband and My little children three, What means hast thou to bring me to, If I should go with thee?’ 25 ‘I have seven ships upon the sea; When they are come to land, Both marriners and marchandize Shall be at thy command. 26 ‘The ship wherein my love shall sail Is glorious to behold; The sails shall be of finest silk, And the mast of shining gold.’ 27 When he had told her these fair tales, To love him she began, Because he was in human shape, Much like unto a man. 28 And so together away they went From off the English shore, And since that time the woman-kind Was never seen no more. 29 But when her husband he come home And found his wife was gone, And left her three sweet pretty babes Within the house alone, 30 He beat his breast, he tore his hair, The tears fell from his eyes, And in the open streets he run With heavy doleful cries. 31 And in this sad distracted case He hangd himself for woe Upon a tree near to the place; The truth of all is so. 32 The children now are fatherless, And left without a guide, But yet no doubt the heavenly powers Will for them well provide. The Distressed Ship—Carpenter JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—B The Rambler's Garland, British Museum, 11621, c. 4 (57). 1785(?) 1 ‘Well met, well met, my own true love, Long time I have been seeking thee; I am lately come from the salt sea, And all for the sake, love, of thee. 2 ‘I might have had a king's daughter, And fain she would have married me; But I've forsaken all her crowns of gold, And all for the sake, love, of thee.’ 3 ‘If you might have had a king's daughter, I think you much to blame; I would not for five hundred pounds That my husband should hear the same. 4 ‘For my husband is a carpenter, And a young ship-carpenter is he, And by him I have a little son, Or else, love, I'd go along with thee. 5 ‘But if I should leave my husband dear, Likewise my little son also, What have you to maintain me withal, If I along with you should go?’ 6 ‘I have seven ships upon the seas, And one of them brought me to land, And seventeen mariners to wait on thee, For to be, love, at your command. 7 ‘A pair of slippers thou shalt have, They shall be made of beaten gold, Nay and be lin'd with velvet soft, For to keep thy feet from cold. 8 ‘A gilded boat thou then shall have, The oars shall gilded be also, And mariners to row the[e] along, For to keep thee from thy overthrow.’ 9 They had not been long upon the sea Before that she began to weep: ‘What, weep you for my gold?’ he said, ‘Or do you weep for my fee? 10 ‘Or do you weep for some other young man That you love much better than me?’ ‘No, I do weep for my little son, That should have come along with me.’ 11 She had not been upon the seas Passing days three or four But the mariner and she were drowned, And never were heard of more. 12 When tidings to old England came The ship-carpenter's wife was drownd, He wrung his hands and tore his hair, And grievously fell in a swoon. 13 ‘Oh cursed be those mariners! For they do lead a wicked life; They ruind me, a ship-carpenter, By deluding away my wife.’ James Herries JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—C Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 214. 1 ‘O are ye my father? Or are ye my mother? Or are ye my brother John? Or are ye James Herries, my first true-love, Come back to Scotland again?’ 2 ‘I am not your father, I am not your mother, Nor am I your brother John; But I'm James Herries, your first true-love, Come back to Scotland again.’ 3 ‘Awa, awa, ye former lovers, Had far awa frae me! For now I am another man's wife Ye'll neer see joy o me.’ 4 ‘Had I kent that ere I came here, I neer had come to thee; For I might hae married the king's daughter, Sae fain she woud had me. 5 ‘I despised the crown o gold, The yellow silk also, And I am come to my true-love, But with me she'll not go.’ 6 ‘My husband he is a carpenter, Makes his bread on dry land, And I hae born him a young son; Wi you I will not gang.’ 7 ‘You must forsake your dear husband, Your little young son also, Wi me to sail the raging seas, Where the stormy winds do blow.’ 8 ‘O what hae you to keep me wi, If I should with you go, If I'd forsake my dear husband, My little young son also?’ 9 ‘See ye not yon seven pretty ships? The eighth brought me to land, With merchandize and mariners, And wealth in every hand.’ 10 She turnd her round upon the shore Her love's ships to behold; Their topmasts and their mainyards Were coverd oer wi gold. 11 Then she's gane to her little young son, And kissd him cheek and chin; Sae has she to her sleeping husband, And dune the same to him. 12 ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, my husband? I wish ye wake in time! I woudna for ten thousand pounds This night ye knew my mind.’ 13 She's drawn the slippers on her feet, Were coverd oer wi gold, Well lined within wi velvet fine, To had her frae the cold. 14 She hadna sailed upon the sea A league but barely three Till she minded on her dear husband, Her little young son tee. 15 ‘O gin I were at land again, At land where I woud be, The woman neer shoud bear the son Shoud gar me sail the sea.’ 16 ‘O hold your tongue, my sprightly flower, Let a' your mourning be; I'll show you how the lilies grow On the banks o Italy.’ 17 She hadna sailed on the sea A day but barely ane Till the thoughts o grief came in her mind, And she langd for to be hame. 18 ‘O gentle death, come cut my breath, I may be dead ere morn! I may be buried in Scottish ground, Where I was bred and born!’ 19 ‘O hold your tongue, my lily leesome thing, Let a' your mourning be; But for a while we'll stay at Rose Isle, Then see a far countrie. 20 ‘Ye'se neer be buried in Scottish ground, Nor land ye's nae mair see; I brought you away to punish you For the breaking your vows to me. 21 ‘I said ye shoud see the lilies grow On the banks o Italy; But I'll let you see the fishes swim, In the bottom o the sea.’ 22 He reached his hand to the topmast, Made a' the sails gae down, And in the twinkling o an ee Baith ship and crew did drown. 23 The fatal flight o this wretched maid Did reach her ain countrie; Her husband then distracted ran, And this lament made he: 24 ‘O wae be to the ship, the ship, And wae be to the sea, And wae be to the mariners Took Jeanie Douglas frae me! 25 ‘O bonny, bonny was my love, A pleasure to behold; The very hair o my love's head Was like the threads o gold. 26 ‘O bonny was her cheek, her cheek, And bonny was her chin, And bonny was the bride she was, The day she was made mine!’ The Carpenter's Wife JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—D Kinloch MSS, I, 297; from the recitation of T. Kinnear, Stonehaven. 1 ‘O whare hae ye been, my dearest dear, These seven lang years and more?’ ‘O I am come to seek my former vows, That ye promisd me before.’ 2 ‘Awa wi your former vows,’ she says, ‘Or else ye will breed strife; Awa wi your former vows,’ she says, ‘For I'm become a wife. 3 ‘I am married to a ship-carpenter, A ship-carpenter he's bound; I wadna he kend my mind this nicht For twice five hundred pound.’ 4 She has put her foot on gude ship-board, And on ship-board she's gane, And the veil that hung oure her face Was a' wi gowd begane. 5 She had na sailed a league, a league, A league but barely twa, Till she did mind on the husband she left, And her wee young son alsua. 6 ‘O haud your tongue, my dearest dear, Let all your follies abee; I'll show whare the white lillies grow, On the banks of Italie.’ 7 She had na sailed a league, a league, A league but barely three, Till grim, grim grew his countenance, And gurly grew the sea. 8 ‘O haud your tongue, my dearest dear, Let all your follies abee; I'll show whare the white lillies grow, In the bottom of the sea.’ 9 He's tane her by the milk-white hand, And he's thrown her in the main; And full five-and-twenty hundred ships Perishd all on the coast of Spain. The Dæmon Lover JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—E Motherwell's MS., p. 97. 1 ‘Where have you been, my long lost lover, This seven long years and more?’ ‘I've been seeking gold for thee, my love, And riches of great store. 2 ‘Now I'm come for the vows you promised me, You promised me long ago;’ ‘My former vows you must forgive, For I'm a wedded wife.’ 3 ‘I might have been married to a king's daughter, Far, far ayont the sea; But I refused the crown of gold, And it's all for the love of thee.’ 4 ‘If you might have married a king's daughter, Yourself you have to blame; For I'm married to a ship's-carpenter, And to him I have a son. 5 ‘Have you any place to put me in, If I with you should gang?’ ‘I've seven brave ships upon the sea, All laden to the brim. 6 ‘I'll build my love a bridge of steel, All for to help her oer; Likewise webs of silk down by her side, To keep my love from the cold.’ 7 She took her eldest son into her arms, And sweetly did him kiss: ‘My blessing go with you, and your father too, For little does he know of this.’ 8 As they were walking up the street, Most beautiful for to behold, He cast a glamour oer her face, And it shone like the brightest gold. 9 As they were walking along the sea-side, Where his gallant ship lay in, So ready was the chair of gold To welcome this lady in. 10 They had not sailed a league, a league, A league but scarsely three, Till altered grew his countenance, And raging grew the sea. 11 When they came to yon sea-side, She set her down to rest; It's then she spied his cloven foot, Most bitterly she wept. 12 ‘O is it for gold that you do weep? Or is it for fear? Or is it for the man you left behind When that you did come here?’ 13 ‘It is not for gold that I do weep, O no, nor yet for fear; But it is for the man I left behind When that I did come here. 14 ‘O what a bright, bright hill is yon, That shines so clear to see?’ ‘O it is the hill of heaven,’ he said, ‘Where you shall never be.’ 15 ‘O what a black, dark hill is yon, That looks so dark to me?’ ‘O it is the hill of hell,’ he said, ‘Where you and I shall be. 16 ‘Would you wish to see the fishes swim In the bottom of the sea, Or wish to see the leaves grow green On the banks of Italy?’ 17 ‘I hope I'll never see the fishes swim On the bottom of the sea, But I hope to see the leaves grow green On the banks of Italy.’ 18 He took her up to the topmast high, To see what she could see; He sunk the ship in a flash of fire, To the bottom of the sea. The Dæmon Lover JAMES HARRIS (THE DÆMON LOVER)—F Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, fifth edition, 1812, II, 427; taken down from the recitation of Walter Grieve by William Laidlaw. 1 ‘O where have you been, my long, long love, This long seven years and mair?’ ‘O I'm come to seek my former vows Ye granted me before.’ 2 ‘O hold your tongue of your former vows, For they will breed sad strife; O hold your tongue of your former vows, For I am become a wife.’ 3 He turned him right and round about, And the tear blinded his ee: ‘I wad never hae trodden on Irish ground, If it had not been for thee. 4 ‘I might hae had a king's daughter, Far, far beyond the sea; I might have had a king's daughter, Had it not been for love o thee.’ 5 ‘If ye might have had a king's daughter, Yer sel ye had to blame; Ye might have taken the king's daughter, For ye kend that I was nane. 6 ‘If I was to leave my husband dear, And my two babes also, O what have you to take me to, If with you I should go?’ 7 ‘I hae seven ships upon the sea— The eighth brought me to land— With four-and-twenty bold mariners, And music on every hand.’ 8 She has taken up her two little babes, Kissd them baith cheek and chin: ‘O fair ye weel, my ain two babes, For I'll never see you again.’ 9 She set her foot upon the ship, No mariners could she behold; But the sails were o the taffetie, And the masts o the beaten gold. 10 She had not sailed a league, a league, A league but barely three, When dismal grew his countenance, And drumlie grew his ee. 11 They had not saild a league, a league, A league but barely three, Until she espied his cloven foot, And she wept right bitterlie. 12 ‘O hold your tongue of your weeping,’ says he, ‘Of your weeping now let me be; I will shew you how the lilies grow On the banks of Italy.’ 13 ‘O what hills are yon, yon pleasant hills, That the sun shines sweetly on?’ ‘O yon are the hills of heaven,’ he said, ‘Where you will never win.’ 14 ‘O whaten a mountain is yon,’ she said, ‘All so dreary wi frost and snow?’ ‘O yon is the mountain of hell,’ he cried, ‘Where you and I will go.’ 15 He strack the tap-mast wi his hand, The fore-mast wi his knee, And he brake that gallant ship in twain, And sank her in the sea.

And how do you love the bold mariners That wait upon thee and me?’ 4 ‘O I do love the ship,’ she said, ‘And I do love the sea; But woe be to the dim mariners, That nowhere I can see!’ 5 They had not sailed a mile awa, Never a mile but one, When she began to weep and mourn, And to think on her little wee son. 6 ‘O hold your tongue, my dear,’ he said, ‘And let all your weeping abee, For I'll soon show to you how the lilies grow On the banks of Italy.’ 7 They had not sailed a mile awa, Never a mile but two, Until she espied his cloven foot, From his gay robes sticking thro. 8 They had not sailed a mile awa, Never a mile but three, When dark, dark, grew his eerie looks, And raging grew the sea. 9 They had not sailed a mile awa, Never a mile but four, When the little wee ship ran round about, And never was seen more.

Chambers, The Romantic Scottish Ballads, etc., 1859, p. 37; “taken down many years ago from the singing of an old man in the south of Scotland.” 1 It happened once upon a time, When the king he was from home, Sir Fenwick he has stolen his jewels, And laid the blame on James Hatley. 2 James Hatley was in prison strong, A wait he was condemned to die; There was not one in all the court To speak one word for James Hatley. 3 No one but the king's daughter, A wait she loved him tenderlie; She's stolen the keys from her father's head, And gaed and conversed wi James Hatley. 4 ‘Come, tell to me now, James,’ she said, ‘Come, tell to me if thou hast them stolen, And I'll make a vow, and I'll keep it true, Ye shall never be the worse of me.’ 5 ‘I have not stolen them, lady,’ he said, ‘Nor as little it was intended by me; Sir Fenwick he has stolen them himself; A wait he has laid the blame on me.’ 6 ‘One asking, one asking, father dear, One asking, one asking grant to me, For I never asked one in my life; I am sure you cannot but grant it to me.’ 7 ‘Weel ask it, weel ask it, daughter dear, Ask it, and it granted shall be; If it should be my hole estate, Naesaid, naesaid, it shall not be.’ 8 ‘I want none of your gold, father, And I want none of your fee; All that I ask, father dear, It is the life of James Hatley.’ 9 ‘Weel ask it, weel ask it, daughter dear, Weel ask it, and it answerëd shall be; For I'll make a vow, and I'll keep it true, James Hatley shall never hangëd be.’ 10 ‘Another asking, father dear, Another asking grant to me; Let Fenwick and Hatley go [to] the sword, And let them try their verity.’ 11 ‘'Tis weel askëd, daughter dear, 'Tis weel asked, and it granted shall be; For eer the morn or twelve o'clock They both at the point of the sword shall be.’ 12 James Hatley was fifteen years old, Sir Fenwick he was thirty three; But James lap about, and he struck about, Till he's gaen Sir Fenwick wounds three. 13 ‘Hold up, hold up, James Hatley,’ he cry'd, ‘And let my breath go out and in; For I have stolen them myself, More shame and disgrace it is to me.’ 14 Up and spake an English lord, And O but he spake haughtily! ‘I would reather given my whole estates Before ye had not hanged James Hatley.’ 15 But up and spake a Scottish lord, And O but he spake boldly! ‘I would reather hae foughten among blood to the knees Before ye had hanged James Hatley.’ 16 Up and spake the king's eldest son, ‘Come hame, James Hatley, and dine wi me; For I've made a vow, I'll keep it true, Ye's be my captain by land and by sea.’ 17 Up and spake the king's daughter, ‘Come home, James Hatley, and dine wi me; For I've made a vow, I'll keep it true, I'll never marry a man but thee.’ James Hately JAMES HATLEY—B “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 39, MS. of Thomas Wilkie, p. 18, “as sung by Chirsty Robertson, Dunse.” The same, transcribed by Thomas Wilkie, “Scotch Ballads,” etc., No 79. Abbotsford. 1 It happened once upon a time, When the king he was from home, False Fennick he has stolen his jewels, And laid the blame on James Hately. 2 The day was sett And the wind blew shill oer the lea; There was not one in all the court To speak a word for James Hately. 3 James is to the prince's chamber gone, And he's bowd low down on his knee: ‘What will ye do for me, my little pretty prince? O what will ye do for your page, James Hately?’ 4 ‘And I will away to my father, the king, And see if your life can savëd be.’ 5 The prince he's to his father gone, And he's bowed low down on his knee: ‘What will ye do for me, my father? O what will ye do for my page, James Hately?’ 6 ‘James Hately has my jewels stolen, A Norland lord hath told it to me; James Hately has my jewels stolen, And oer the barras he maun die.’ 7 The prince he drew his little brown sword— It was made of the metal so free— And he swore he would fight them man by man That would lay the blame on James Hately. 8 Up then spoke the false Fennick, And an ill-spoken man was he; ‘James Hately has the king's jewels stolen, ’ 9 The prince he drew his little brown sword— It was made of the metal so free— And he's thrust it in false Fennick's side, And given him death-wounds two or three. 10 ‘O hold your hand, my little pretty prince, And let my breath go out and in, For spilling of my noble blood And shaming of my noble kin. 11 ‘O hold your hand, my little pretty prince, And let my breath go out and in, And there's the key of my coffer, And you'll find the king's jewels lying therein.’ 12 ‘If this be true,’ the king he said, ‘If this be true ye tell to me, I will take your lands, false Fennick,’ he said, ‘And give them all to James Hately.’ Jamie O'Lee JAMES HATLEY—C Motherwell's MS., p. 654; “from the recitation of the wife of Charles Drain, sow-gelder, etc., Kilmarnock.” 1 There was a fause knicht in the court, And he was fu o treacherie, And he staw the queen's jewels in the nicht, And left the wyte on Jamie O'Lee. 2 The king he wrate a braid letter, And sealed it richt tenderlie, And he sent it to his only son, To come and speak to him speedilie. 3 When he cam afore the king, He kneeled low down on his knee: ‘What is your will, my sovereign leige? What is your will? cum tell to me.’ 4 ‘Jamie O'Lee has my jewels stown, As the English lord tells unto me, And out o Scotland he shall be sent, And sent awa to Germanie.’ 5 ‘O no, O no,’ then said the prince, ‘Sic things as that can never be; But get me a man that will take on hand The morn to fecht young Jamie O'Lee.’ 6 Syne out and spak the fause Phenix, And oh, he spak richt spitefullie; ‘I am the man will tak on han To fecht and conquer Jamie O'Lee.’ 7 ‘Oh no, oh no,’ syne said the prince, ‘Sic things as that can never bee, For Jamie O'Lee's no fifteen years auld, And ye, fause Phenix, are thretty three.’ 8 The prince he mounted then wi speed, He's aff wi tidings to Jamie O'Lee, Saying, The morn's morning ye maun fecht, Or out o England banisht bee. 9 When Jamie O'Lee the tidings heard, Fast the saut tear blindit his ee; ‘I'm saikless o thae jewels,’ he said, ‘As the bairn that sits on the nourice knee.’ 10 Then Phenix munted a scaffold hie, A' for to shaw his veritie; Whilk gart the nobles a' to cry ‘A dead man are ye, Jamie O'Lee!’ 11 The first straik the fause Phenix gied, He gart the blude rin speedilie; It gart the prince's heart to ache, And cry, Oh, alace for my Jamie O'Lee! 12 Jamie O'Lee he stepped back, Waiting for opportunitie, And wi his sword baith lang and sharp He ran it thro Phenix fause bodie. 13 ‘O haud your hand, Jamie O'Lee,’ he said, ‘And let the breath remain in me, And skail nae mair o my noble blude, 'Tis a great disgrace to my loyaltie.’ 14 ‘Confess, confess, ye fause Phenix, Confess your faults this day to me; Were there nae mair men in a' England, My ain twa hands your death suld be.’ 15 ‘Ye were sae great wi king and queen, I thocht I wuld hae banisht thee, And I staw the queen's jewels in the nicht, And left the wyte on Jamie O'Lee.’ 16 Syne out and spak the king himsell, Saying, Jamie O'Lee, come hame wi me, And there's no a knicht in a' my court But what at your command sall be. 17 Syne out and spak the queen hersell, Saying, Jamie O'Lee, come hame wi me, And there's no a month in a' the year But changed and brothered ye sall be. 18 Syne out and spak the prince himsell, Saying, Jamie O'Lee, come hame wi me; I hae free lands in a' Scotland, And at your command they a' sall be. 19 ‘I thank ye, king, and I thank ye, queen, I thank ye a', nobilitie, But a prince's page I was a' my life, And a prince's page I yet will be.’ 20 The king gied him a silk waistcoat, And it was lined wi the taffetie, Wi a band o gowd around his neck, And a prince's page he seems to be. 245 YOUNG ALLAN YOUNG ALLAN—A Skene MS., p. 33; taken down in the north of Scotland, 1802-3. 1 A' the skippers of bonny Lothain, As they sat at the wine, There fell a reesin them amang, An it was in unhappy time. 2 Some o them reesd their hawks, An some o them their hounds, An some o them their ladies gay, Trod neatly on the ground; Young Allan he reesd his comely cog, That lay upon the strand. 3 ‘I hae as good a ship this day As ever sailed our seas, Except it be the Burges Black, But an the Small Cordvine, The Comely Cog of Dornisdale; We's lay that three bye in time.’ 4 Out spak there a little boy, Just at Young Allan's knee: ‘Ye lie, ye lie, Young Allan, Sae loud's I hear ye lie. 5 ‘For my master has a little boat Will sail thrice as well as thine; For she'll gang in at your foremast, An gae out your fore-lee, An nine times in a winter night She'll tak the wind frae thee.’ 6 ‘O what will ye wad, ye Young Allan? Or what will ye wad wi me?’ ‘I'll wad my head against your land Till I get more monnie.’ 7 They had na saild a league, A league but barely three, But through an thro the bonny ship They saw the green wall sea. 8 They had na saild a league, A league but barely five, But through an thro their bonny ship They saw the green well wave. 9 He gaed up to the topmast, To see what he coud see, And there he saw the Burgess Black, But an the Small Cordvine, The Comely Cog of Dornisdale; The three was rent in nine. 10 Young Allan grat an wrang his hands, An he kent na what to dee: ‘The win is loud, and the waves are proud, An we'll a' sink in the sea. 11 ‘But gin I coud get a bonny boy Wad tak my helm in han, That would steer my bonny ship, An bring her safe to land, 12 ‘He shoud get the twa part o my goud, The third part o my land, An gin we win safe to shore He shoud get my dochter Ann.’ 13 ‘O here am I, a bonny boy That will tak your helm in han, An will steer your bonny ship An bring her safe to lan. 14 ‘Ye tak four-an-twenty feather-beds An lay the bonny ship round, An as much of the good canvas As mak her hale an soun.’ 15 They took four-an-twenty feather-beds An laid the bonny ship roun, An as much o the good canvas As made her hale an soun. 16 ‘Spring up, spring up, my bonny ship, An goud sall be your hire!’ Whan the bonny ship heard o that, That goud shoud be her hire, She sprang as fast frae the sat water As sparks do frae the fire. 17 ‘Spring up, spring up, my bonny ship, And goud sall be your fee!’ Whan the bonny ship heard o that, That goud shoud be her fee, She sprang as fast frae the sat water As the leaf does frae the tree. 18 The sailors stan on the shore-side, Wi their auld baucheld sheen: ‘Thanks to God an our guid master That ever we came safe to land!’ 19 ‘Whar is the bonny boy That took my helm in han, That steerd my bonny ship, An brought her safe to lan? 20 ‘He's get the twa part o my goud, The third part o my lan, An, since we're come safe to shore, He's get my dochter Ann.’ 21 ‘O here am I, the bonny boy That took your helm in han, That steered your bonny ship, An brought her safe to lan. 22 ‘I winna hae the twa part o your goud, Nor the third part o your lan, But, since we hae win safe to shore, I'll wed your dochter Ann.’ 23 Forty ships went to the sea, Forty ships and five, An there never came ane o a' back, But Young Allan, alive. Young Allan YOUNG ALLAN—B Buchan's MSS, II, 182. 1 There were four-an-twenty sailors bold Sat drinking at the wine; There fell a rousing them among, In an unseally time. 2 Some there reasd their hawk, their hawk, And some there reasd their hound, But Young Allan reasd his comely cog, As she floats on the feam. 3 ‘There's not a ship amang you a' Will sail alang wi me, But the comely cog o Heckland Hawk, And Flower o Germanie, And the Black Snake o Leve London; They are all gane frae me.’ 4 The wager was a gude wager, Of fifty tuns of wine, And as much o the gude black silk As cleathd their lemans fine. 5 At midnight dark the wind up stark, The seas began to rout; Young Allan and his bonny new ship Gaed three times witherlins about. 6 ‘O faer will I get a bonny boy Will take my helm in hand Ere I gang up to the tapmast-head To look for some dry land?’ 7 ‘O waken, waken your drunken men, As they lie drunk wi wine; For when ye came thro Edinburgh town Ye bought them shoes o ben. 8 ‘There was no shoe made for my feet, Nor gluve made for my hand; But nevertheless, my dear master, I'll take your helm in hand Till ye gae to the topmast head And look for some dry land.’ 9 ‘I cannot see no day, no day, Nor no meathe can I ken; But mony a bonny feather-bed Lies floating on the faem.’ 10 ‘Come down, come down, my dear master, You see not what I see; Through an through your bonny new ship Comes in the green haw sea.’ 11 ‘Take fifty ells o the canvas broad And wrap it in a' roun, And as much o good pich an tar Make her go hale an soun. 12 ‘Sail on, sail on, my bonny ship, And haste ye to dry lan, And every nail that is in you Shall be a gay gold pin. 13 ‘Sail on, sail on, my bonny ship, And hae me to some lan, And a firlot full o guineas red Will be dealt at the lan's end.’ 14 The ship she hearkend to their voice And listend to their leed, And she gaed thro the green haw sea Like fire out o a gleed. 15 When the ship got word o that, Goud was to be her beat, She's flowen thro the stormy seas Like sparks out o a weet. 16 The first an shore that they came till, It was the shore o Troup; Wi cannons an great shooting there, They held Young Allan out. 17 The next an shore that they came till, It was the shore o Lee; Wi piping an sweet singing there, They towed Young Allan tee. 18 The next an shore that they came till, It was the shore o Lin; Wi drums beating and pipers playing, They towed Young Allan in, And Allan's lady she was there, To welcome Allan hame. 19 ‘O faer is my little boy,’ he said, ‘That I brought oer the sea?’ ‘I'm coming, master, running, master, At your command shall be.’ 20 ‘O take to you my comely cog, And wed my daughter free, And a' for this ae night's wark That ye did wake wi me.’ Young Allan YOUNG ALLAN—C Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 11. 1 All the skippers o Scarsburgh Sat drinking at the wine; There fell a rousing them amang, On an unseally time. 2 Some there rousd their hawk, their hawk, And some there rousd their hound, But Young Allan rousd his comely cog, As she stood on dry ground. 3 ‘There's nae a ship in Scarsburgh Will sail the seas wi mine, Except it be the Burgess Black, Or than the smack calld Twine. 4 ‘There's nae a ship amang you a' Will sail alang wi me, But the comely cog o Hecklandhawk, And Flower o Yermanie, And the Black Snake o Leve London; They are a' gane frae me.’ 5 Out it speaks a little wee boy Stood by Young Allan's knee; ‘My master has a coal-carrier Will take the wind frae thee. 6 ‘She will gae out under the leaf, Come in under the lee, And nine times in a winter night She'll turn the wind wi thee.’ 7 When they had wagerd them amang Full fifty tuns o wine, Besides as mickle gude black silk As clathe their lemans fine, 8 When all the rest went to the tows, All the whole night to stay, Young Allan he went to his bower, There with his God to pray. 9 ‘There shall nae man gang to my ship Till I say mass and dine, And take my leave o my lady; Gae to my bonny ship syne.’ 10 Then they saild east on Saturday, On Sunday sailëd west; Likewise they sailed on Mononday Till twelve, when they did rest. 11 At midnight dark the wind up stark, And seas began to rout, Till Allan and his bonny new ship Gaed three times witherlands about. 12 ‘O,’ sighing says the Young Allan, ‘I fear a deadly storm; For mony a heaving sinking sea Strikes sair on my ship's stern. 13 ‘Where will I get a little wee boy Will take my helm in hand Till I gang up to my tapmast And see for some dry land?’ 14 ‘O waken, waken your drunken men, As they lye drunk wi wine; For when ye came thro Edinbro town Ye bought them sheen o ben. 15 ‘There was nae shoe made for my foot, Nor gluve made for my hand; But nevertheless, my dear master, I'll take your helm in hand Till ye gang to the tall tapmast And look for some dry land. 16 ‘And here am I, a little wee boy Will take your helm in han Till ye gang up to your tapmast, But, master, stay not lang.’ 17 ‘I cannot see nae day, nae day, Nor nae meathe can I ken; But mony a bonny feather-bed Lyes floating on the faem, And the comely cog o Normanshore, She never will gang hame.’ 18 The comely cog o Nicklingame Came sailing by his hand; Says, Gae down, gae down, ye gude skipper, Your ship sails on the sand. 19 ‘Come down, come down, my gude master, Ye see not what I see; For thro and thro our comely cog I see the green haw sea.’ 20 ‘Take fifty ells o gude canvas And wrap the ship a' round; And pick her weell, and spare her not, And make her hale and sound. 21 ‘If ye will sail, my bonny ship, Till we come to dry land, For ilka iron nail in you, Of gowd there shall be ten.’ 22 The ship she listend all the while, And, hearing of her hire, She flew as swift threw the saut sea As sparks do frae the fire. 23 The first an shore that they came till, They ca'd it Howdoloot; Wi drums beating and cannons shouting, They held our gude ship out. 24 The next an shore that they came till, They ca'd it Howdilee; Wi drums beating and fifes playing, They bare her to the sea. 25 The third an shore that they came till, They ca'd it Howdilin; Wi drums beating and pipes playing, They towd our gude ship in. 26 The sailors walkd upon the shore, Wi their auld baucheld sheen, And thanked God and their Lady, That brought them safe again. 27 ‘For we went out o Scarsburgh Wi fifty ships and three; But nane o them came back again But Young Allan, ye see.’ 28 ‘Come down, come down, my little wee boy, Till I pay you your fee; I hae but only ae daughter, And wedded to her ye'se be.’ Young Allan YOUNG ALLAN—D Murison MS., p. 117; learned by Mrs Murison from her mother, Old Deer, Aberdeenshire. 1 There was three lords sat drinkin wine In bonnie Aberdeen, [O] 2 Some o them talked o their merchandise, An some o their ladies fine, [O] But Young Allan he talked o his bonnie ship, That cost him mony a poun. 3 ‘Whar will I get a bonnie wee boy That'll tak my helm in han, O Till I gang up to my high topmast An look oot for some dry lan? 4 ‘He'll get half o my gowd, an half o my gear, An the third pairt o my lan, An gin he row me safe on shore He shall hae my daughter Ann.’ 5 ‘O here am I, a bonny wee boy That'll tak your helm in han Till ye gang up to your high topmast An look oot for some dry lan. 6 ‘I'll nae seek your gowd, nor I'll nae seek your gear, Nor the third pairt o your lan, But gin I row you safe to shore I shall hae your daughter Ann. 7 ‘Come doon, come doon, Young Allan,’ he cries, ‘Ye see nae what I see; For through an through your bonnie ship-side An I see the open sea. 8 ‘Ye'll tak twenty-four o your feather-beds, Ye'll busk your bonnie ship roon, An as much o the guid canvas-claith As gar her gang hale an soun. 9 ‘An whar ye want an iron bolt Ye'll ca a siller pin, An whar ye want an oaken bolt Ye'll beat the yellow gold in.’ 10 He's taen twenty-four o his feather-beds An buskit's bonnie ship roon, An as much o the guid canvas-claith As gar her gang hale an soun. 11 An whar he's wantit an iron bolt He's ca'd a siller pin, An whar he's wantit an oaken bolt He's beat the yellow gold in. 12 The firstan shore that they cam till, It was the shore o Linn; They held their spears an beenits oot, An they wouldna lat Allan in. 13 The neistan shore that they cam till It was the shore o ; An they turned their ship aboot. 14 But the neistan shore that they cam till, 'Twas bonnie Aberdeen; The fifes an drums they a' did play, To welcome Allan in. 15 ‘O where is he, the bonnie wee boy That took my helm in han Till I gied up to my high topmast An lookd oot for some dry lan? 16 ‘He's get half o my gowd, an half o my gear, An the third pairt o my lan, An since he's rowt me safe to shore He sall hae my daughter Ann.’ 17 ‘O here am I, the bonnie wee boy That took your helm in han Till ye gied up to your high topmast An lookd oot for some dry lan. 18 ‘I'll nae seek half o your good, nor half o your gear, Nor the third pairt o your lan, But since I've rowt you safe to shore I sall hae your daughter Ann.’ Earl Patrick YOUNG ALLAN—E Kinloch MSS, V, 395; in the handwriting of John Hill Burton, when a youth. 1 The king he sits in Dumfermline, Birlin at the wine, And callin for the best skipper That ever sailed the faem. 2 Then out it spak a bonny boy, Sat at the king's right knee; ‘Earl Patrick is the best skipper That ever sailed the sea.’ 3 The king he wrote a braed letter, And sealed it wi his ring, And sent it to Earl Patrick, 4 ‘Oh wha is this, or wha is that, Has tald the king o me? For I was niver a gude mariner, And niver sailed the sea. 5 ‘Ye'll eat and drink, my merry young men, The red wine you amang, For blaw it wind, or blaw it sleet, Our ship maun sail the morn. 6 ‘Late yestreen I saw the new meen Wi the auld meen in hir arm,’ And sichand said him Earl Patrick, ‘I fear a deadly storm.’ 7 They sailed up, sae did they down, Thro mony a stormy stream, Till they saw the Dam o Micklengaem, When she sank amang the faem. 8 They sailed up, sae did they down, Thro many a stormy stream, Till they saw the Duke o Normandy, And she sank among the faem. 9 They sailed up, sae did they down, Thro many a stormy stream, Till they saw the Black Shater o Leve London, And her topmast gaed in nine. 10 ‘Where will I get a bonny boy That will tack my helm in hand Till I gang up to my topmast, And spy for some dry land?’ 11 ‘Now here am I, a bonny boy Will tack yer helm in hand Till ye go up to your topmast But I fear ye'll never see land.’ 12 ‘Cum down, cum down, my gude master, Ye see not what I see, For through and through yer bonny ship I see the raging sea.’ 13 ‘Ye'll tak four-and-twenty fether-beds And lay my bonny ship roun, And as muckle o the fine canvas As make her haill and soun. 14 ‘And where she wants an iron nail O silver she's hae three, And where she wants a timmer-pin We'll rap the red goud in.’ 15 The firsten shore that they cam till, They cad it shore the Linn; Wi heart and hand and good command, They towed their bonny ship in. 16 The nexten shore that they came till, They caad it shore the Lee; With heart and hand and good command, They towed the bonny ship tee. 17 There was twenty ships gaed to the sea, Twenty ships and ane, And there was na ane came back again But Earl Patrick alane. 246 REDESDALE AND WISE WILLIAM Reedisdale and Wise William REDESDALE AND WISE WILLIAM—A Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 70; written down from memory by Mr Nicol, Strichen, as learned in his earlier years from old people. 1 When Reedisdale and Wise William Were drinking at the wine, There fell a roosing them amang, On an unruly time. 2 For some o them hae roosd their hawks, And other some their hounds, And other some their ladies fair, And their bowers whare they walkd in. 3 When out it spake him Reedisdale, And a rash word spake he; Says, There is not a lady fair, In bower wherever she be, But I could aye her favour win Wi ae blink o my ee. 4 Then out it spake him Wise William, And a rash word spake he; Says, I have a sister of my own, In bower where ever she be, And ye will not her favour win With three blinks of your ee. 5 ‘What will ye wager, Wise William? My lands I'll wad with thee;’ ‘I'll wad my head against your land, Till I get more monie.’ 6 Then Reedisdale took Wise William, Laid him in prison strang, That he might neither gang nor ride, Nor ae word to her send. 7 But he has written a braid letter, Between the night and day, And sent it to his own sister By dun feather and gray. 8 When she had read Wise William's letter, She smilëd and she leugh; Said, Very well, my dear brother, Of this I have eneuch. 9 She looked out at her west window To see what she could see, And there she spied him Reedisdale Come riding ower the lea. 10 Says, Come to me, my maidens all, Come hitherward to me; For here it comes him Reedisdale, Who comes a-courting me. 11 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, A sight of you give me;’ ‘Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For me you will not see.’ 12 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, A sight of you give me; And bonny are the gowns of silk That I will give to thee.’ 13 ‘If you have bonny gowns of silk, O mine is bonny tee; Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For me you shall not see.’ 14 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, A sight of you I'll see; And bonny jewels, brooches and rings I will give unto thee.’ 15 ‘If you have bonny brooches and rings, O mine are bonny tee; Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For me you shall not see.’ 16 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, One sight of you I'll see; And bonny are the ha's and bowers That I will give to thee.’ 17 ‘If you have bonny ha's and bowers, O mine are bonny tee; Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For me you shall not see.’ 18 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, A sight of you I'll see; And bonny are my lands so broad That I will give to thee.’ 19 ‘If you have bonny lands so broad, O mine are bonny tee; Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For me ye will not see.’ 20 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, A sight of you I'll see; And bonny are the bags of gold That I will give to thee.’ 21 ‘If you have bonny bags of gold, I have bags of the same; Go from my yetts now, Reedisdale, For down I will not come.’ 22 ‘Come down, come down, my lady fair, One sight of you I'll see; Or else I'll set your house on fire, If better cannot be.’ 23 Then he has set the house on fire, And all the rest it tuke; He turned his wight horse head about, Said, Alas, they'll ne'er get out! 24 ‘Look out, look out, my maidens fair, And see what I do see, How Reedisdale has fired our house, And now rides oer the lea. 25 ‘Come hitherwards, my maidens fair, Come hither unto me; For thro this reek, and thro this smeek, O thro it we must be!’ 26 They took wet mantles them about, Their coffers by the band, And thro the reek, and thro the flame, Alive they all have wan. 27 When they had got out thro the fire, And able all to stand, She sent a maid to Wise William, To bruik Reedisdale's land. 28 ‘Your lands is mine now, Reedisdale, For I have won them free;’ ‘If there is a gude woman in the world, Your one sister is she.’ Roudesdales REDESDALE AND WISE WILLIAM—B Harris MS., fol. 14 b; from Mrs Harris. 1 Roudesdales an Clerk William Sat birlin at the wine, An a' the talk was them atween Was aboot the ladies fine, fine, Was aboot the ladies fine. 2 Says Roudesdales to Clerk William, I'll wad my lands wi thee, I'll wad my lands against thy head, An that is what I'll dee, 3 ‘That there's no a leddy in a' the land, That's fair, baith ee an bree, That I winna wed withoot courtin, Wi ae blink o my ee.’ 4 Says William, I've an ae sister, She's fair, baith ee an bree; An you'll no wed her withoot courtin, Wi ae blink o your ee.’ 5 He has wrote a broad letter, Between the nicht an the day, An sent it to his ae sister Wi the white feather an the gray. 6 The firsten line she luekit on, A licht lauchter gae she; But eer she read it to the end The tear blindit her ee. 7 ‘Oh wae betide my ae brither, Wald wad his head for me, ’ 8 Roudesdales to her bour has gane, An rade it round aboot, An there he saw that fair ladie, At a window lookin oot. 9 ‘Come doon, come doon, you fair ladie, Ae sicht o you to see; For the rings are o the goud sae ried That I will gie to thee.’ 10 ‘If yours are o the goud sae ried, Mine's o the silver clear; So get you gone, you Roudesdales, For you sall no be here.’ 11 ‘Come doon, come doon, you lady fair, Ae sicht o you to see; For the gouns are o the silk sae fine That I will gie to thee.’ 12 ‘If yours are o the silk sae fine, Mine's o the bonnie broun; Sa get you gone, you Roudesdales, For I will no come doon.’ 13 ‘Come doon, come doon, you ladie fair, Ae sicht o you to see; For the steeds are o the milk sae white That I will gie to thee.’ 14 ‘If yours are o the milk sae white, Mine's o the bonnie broun; Sae get you gone, you Roudesdales, For I will no come doon.’ 15 ‘Come doon, come doon, you ladie fair, Ae sicht o you to see; Or I will set your bour on fire Atween your nurse an thee.’ 16 ‘You may set my bowr on fire, As I doubt na you will dee, But there'll come a sharp shour frae the wast Will slocken't speedilie.’ 17 He has set her bour on fire, An quickly it did flame; But there cam a sharp shour frae the wast That put it oot again. 18 Oot amang the fire an smoke That bonnie lady cam, Wi as muckle goud aboon her bree As wald bocht an earldom. 19 ‘Oh wae betide you, ill woman, An ill, ill died may you dee!

How golden yallow is your hair! Of all the maids of fair Scotland, There's nane like Lady Elspat fair.’ 2 ‘Perform your vows, Sweet William,’ she says, ‘The vows which ye ha made to me, An at the back o my mother's castle This night I'll surely meet wi thee.’ 3 But wae be to her brother's page, Who heard the words this twa did say! He's told them to her lady mother, Who wrought Sweet William mieckle wae. 4 For she has taen him Sweet William, An she's gard bind him wi his bow-string Till the red bluide o his fair body Frae ilka nail o his hand did spring. 5 O it fell once upon a time That the Lord Justice came to town; Out has she taen him Sweet William, Brought him before Lord Justice boun. 6 ‘An what is the crime, now, madame,’ he says, ‘Has been committed by this young man?’ ‘O he has broken my bonny castel, That was well biggit wi lime an stane. 7 ‘An he has broken my bonny coffers, That was well banded wi aiken ban, An he has stoln my rich jewels; I wot he has them every one.’ 8 Then out it spake her Lady Elspat, As she sat by Lord Justice knee; ‘Now ye hae taul your tale, mother, I pray, Lord Justice, you'l now hear me. 9 ‘He has na broken her bonny castel, That was well biggit wi lime an stane, Nor has he stoln her rich jewels, For I wot she has them every one. 10 ‘But tho he was my first true love, An tho I had sworn to be his bride, Cause he had not a great estate, She would this way our loves divide.’ 11 An out it spake the Lord Justice, I wot the tear was in his ee; ‘I see nae fault in this young man, Sae loose his bans, an set him free. 12 ‘Take back your love, now, Lady Elspat, An my best blessing you baith upon! For gin he be your first true love, He is my eldest sister's son. 13 ‘There is a steed in my stable Cost me baith gold and white money; Ye's get as mieckle o my free lan As he'll ride about in a summer's day.’ 248 THE GREY COCK, OR, SAW YOU MY FATHER?

And is my Johny true?’ ‘I hae nae time to tell, but sae lang's I like mysell Sae lang will I love you.’ 6 ‘Flee, flee up, my bonny grey cock, And craw whan it is day; Your neck shall be like the bonny beaten gold, And your wings of the silver grey.’ 7 The cock prov'd false, and untrue he was, For he crew an hour oer soon; The lassie thought it day when she sent her love away, And it was but a blink of the moon 249 AULD MATRONS Auld Matrons AULD MATRONS Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 238; Motherwell's MS., p. 585, with the title ‘Love Annie.’ 1 My love she is a gentlewoman, Has her living by the seam; I kenna how she is provided This night for me and my foot-groom. 2 He is gane to Annie's bower-door, And gently tirled at the pin: ‘Ye sleep, ye wake, my love Annie, Ye'll rise and lat your true-love in.’ 3 Wi her white fingers lang and sma She gently lifted up the pin; Wi her arms lang and bent She kindly caught sweet Willie in. 4 ‘O will ye go to cards or dice? Or will ye go to play? Or will ye go to a well made bed, And sleep a while till day?’ 5 ‘I winna gang to cards nor dice, Nor yet will I to play; But I will gang to a well made bed, And sleep a while till day. 6 ‘My love Annie, my dear Annie, I would be at your desire; But wae mat fa the auld Matrons, As she sits by the kitchen fire!’ 7 ‘Keep up your heart, Willie,’ she said, ‘Keep up your heart, dinna fear; It's seven years, and some guid mair, Sin her foot did file the flear.’ 8 They hadna kissd nor love clapped, As lovers when they meet, Till up it raise the auld Matrons, Sae well's she spread her feet. 9 O wae mat fa the auld Matrons, Sae clever's she took the gate! And she's gaen ower yon lang, lang hill, Knockd at the sheriff's yate. 10 ‘Ye sleep, ye wake, my lord?’ she said; ‘Are ye not your bower within? There's a knight in bed wi your daughter, I fear she's gotten wrang.’ 11 ‘Ye'll do ye down thro Kelso town, Waken my wall-wight men; And gin ye hae your wark well dune I'll be there at command.’ 12 She's done her down thro Kelso town, Wakend his wall-wight men; But gin she had her wark well done He was there at command. 13 He had his horse wi corn fodderd, His men armd in mail; He gae the Matrons half a merk To show them ower the hill. 14 Willie sleepd, but Annie waked Till she heard their bridles ring; Then tapped on her love's shoulder, And said, Ye've sleepit lang. 15 ‘O save me, save me, my blessd lady, Till I've on my shooting-gear; I dinna fear the king himsell, Tho he an's men were here.’ 16 Then they shot in, and Willie out, The arrows graz'd his brow; The maid she wept and tore her hair, Says, This can never do. 17 Then they shot in, and he shot out, The bow brunt Willie's hand; But aye he kissd her ruby lips, Said, My dear, thinkna lang. 18 He set his horn to his mouth, And has blawn loud and shrill, And he's calld on his brother John, In Ringlewood he lay still. 19 The first an shot that Lord John shot, He wound fifty and fifteen; The next an shot that Lord John shot, He ca'd out the sheriff's een. 20 ‘O some o you lend me an arm, Some o you lend me twa; And they that came for strife this day, Take horse, ride fast awa. 21 ‘But wae mat fa yon, auld Matrons, An ill death mat ye die!

From Matthew Baker, an old cripple, Lew Down, Devon. b. From Roger Luxton, an old man at Halwell, North Devon. 1 In merry Scotland, in merry Scotland There lived brothers three; They all did cast lots which of them should go A robbing upon the salt sea, 2 The lot it fell on Henry Martyn, The youngest of the three; That he should go rob on the salt, salt sea, To maintain his brothers and he. 3 He had not a sailed a long winter's night, Nor yet a short winter's day, Before that he met with a lofty old ship, Come sailing along that way. 4 O when she came by Henry Martyn, ‘I prithee now, let us go!’ ‘O no! God wot, that, that will I not, O that will I never do. 5 ‘Stand off! stand off!’ said Henry Martyn, ‘For you shall not pass by me; For I am a robber all on the salt seas, To maintain us brothers three. 6 ‘How far, how far,’ cries Henry Martyn, ‘How far do you make it?’ said he; ‘For I am a robber all on the salt seas, To maintain us brothers three.’ 7 For three long hours they merrily fought, For hours they fought full three; At last a deep wound got Henry Martyn, And down by the mast fell he. 8 'Twas broadside to a broadside then, And a rain and hail of blows, But the salt sea ran in, ran in, ran in, To the bottom then she goes. 9 Bad news, bad news for old England, Bad news has come to the town, For a rich merchant's vessel is cast away, And all her brave seamen drown. 10 Bad news, bad news through London street, Bad news has come to the king, For all the brave lives of the mariners lost, That are sunk in the watery main.

Who are you?’ said Henry Martyn, ‘Or how durst thou come so nigh?’ ‘I'm a rich merchant-ship for old England bound, If you please, will you let me pass by.’ 5 ‘O no! O no!’ cried Henry Martyn, ‘O no! that never can be, Since I have turnd robber all on the salt seas, To maintain my two brothers and me. 6 ‘Now lower your topsails, you alderman bold, Come lower them under my lee;’ Saying, ‘I am resolved to pirate you here, To maintain my two brothers and me.’ 7 Then broadside to broadside to battle they went For two or three hours or more; At last Henry Martyn gave her a death-wound, And down to the bottom went she. 8 Bad news, bad news to England has come, Bad news I will tell to you all, 'Twas a rich merchant-ship to England was bound, And most of her merry men drownd. Robin Hood HENRY MARTYN—C Motherwell's MS., p. 660; from the recitation of Alexander Macdonald, coal-heaver, Barkip, parish of Dalry, Ayr; a song of his mother's, a native of Ireland. 1 There were three brothers in bonnie Scotland, In bonnie Scotland lived they, And they cuist kevels themsells amang, Wha sould gae rob upon the salt sea. 2 The lot it fell upon bold Robin Hood, The youngest brither of the hale three: ‘O, I sall gae rob upon the salt sea, And it's all to mauntain my two brothers and me.’ 3 They hadna sailed a lang winter night, A lang winter night scarselie, Till they were aware of a tall, tall ship, Coming sailin down under the lee. 4 ‘O where are you bound for, my bonnie ship?’ Bold Robin Hood he did cry; ‘O I'm a bold merchantman, for London bound, And I pray you, good sir, let us by.’ 5 ‘O no! O no!’ said bold Robin Hood, ‘O no such thing may be; For I will gae in and plunder your ship, And your fair bodies I'll drown in the sea.’ 6 O he has gone in and plundered their ship, And holes in her bottom bored three; The water came in so thick and so fast That down, down to the bottom gade she. 7 Bad news, bad news to old England is gone, Bad news to our king, old Henrie, That his merchant-goods were taken on board, And thirty-five seamen drownd in the sea. [Andrew Bodee] HENRY MARTYN—D Communicated by Mr George M. Richardson, as learned by a lady in northern New Hampshire more than fifty years ago from an aged aunt. 1 Three loving brothers in Scotland dwelt, Three loving brothers were they, And they cast lots to see which of the three Should go robbing all oer the salt sea, salt sea, Should go robbing all oer the salt sea. 2 The lot it fell to Andrew Bodee, The youngest of the three, That he should leave the other two, And go robbing all oer the salt sea.

Ye never were here before;’ ‘Nae news, nae news, but a letter from Your nephew, Johnny Moir. 19 ‘Ye'll take here this braid letter, Seald wi his faith and troth, And ye're bidden bring alang wi you The body Jock o Noth.’ 20 Benachie lyes very low, The tap o Noth lyes high; For a' the distance that's between, He heard auld Johnny cry. 21 Whan on the plain these champions met, Twa grizly ghosts to see, There were three feet between their brows, And shoulders were yards three. 22 These men they ran ower hills and dales, And ower mountains high, Till they came on to Lundan town, At the dawn o the third day. 23 And whan they came to Lundan town The yetts were lockit wi bands, And wha were there but a trumpeter, Wi trumpet in his hands? 24 ‘What is the matter, ye keepers all? Or what's the matter within That the drums do beat and bells do ring, And make sic dolefu din?’ 25 ‘There's naething the matter,’ the keeper said, ‘There's naething the matter to thee, But a weighty Scot to strait the rope, And the morn he maun die.’ 26 ‘O open the yetts, ye proud keepers, Ye'll open without delay;’ The trembling keeper, smiling, said, ‘O I hae not the key.’ 27 ‘Ye'll open the yetts, ye proud keepers, Ye'll open without delay, Or here is a body at my back Frae Scotland has brought the key.’ 28 ‘Ye'll open the yetts,’ says Jock o Noth, ‘Ye'll open them at my call;’ Then wi his foot he has drove in Three yards braid o the wall. 29 As they gaed in by Drury Lane, And down by the town's hall, And there they saw young Johnny Moir Stand on their English wall. 30 ‘Ye're welcome here, my uncle dear, Ye're welcome unto me; Ye'll loose the knot, and slack the rope, And set me frae the tree.’ 31 ‘Is it for murder, or for theft? Or is it for robberie? If it is for ony heinous crime, There's nae remeid for thee.’ 32 ‘It's nae for murder, nor for theft, Nor yet for robberie; A' is for the loving a gay lady They're gaun to gar me die.’ 33 ‘O whar's thy sword,’ says Jock o Noth, ‘Ye brought frae Scotland wi thee? I never saw a Scotsman yet But coud wield a sword or tree.’ 34 ‘A pox upo their lodomy, On me had sic a sway Four o their men, the bravest four, They bore my blade away.’ 35 ‘Bring back his blade,’ says Jock o Noth, ‘And freely to him it gie, Or I hae sworn a black Scot's oath I'll gar five million die. 36 ‘Now whar's the lady?’ says Jock o Noth, ‘Sae fain I woud her see;’ ‘She's lockd up in her ain chamber, The king he keeps the key.’ 37 So they hae gane before the king, With courage bauld and free; Their armour bright cast sic a light That almost dim'd his ee. 38 ‘O whar's the lady?’ says Jock o Noth, ‘Sae fain as I woud her see; For we are come to her wedding, Frae the foot o Benachie.’ 39 ‘O take the lady,’ said the king, ‘Ye welcome are for me; I never thought to see sic men, Frae the foot o Benachie.’ 40 ‘If I had kend,’ said Jock o Noth, ‘Ye'd wonderd sae muckle at me, I woud hae brought ane larger far By sizes three times three. 41 ‘Likewise if I had thought I'd been Sic a great fright to thee, I'd brought Sir John o Erskine Park; He's thretty feet and three.’ 42 ‘Wae to the little boy,’ said the king, ‘Brought tidings unto thee! Let all England say what they will, High hangëd shall he be.’ 43 ‘O if ye hang the little wee boy Brought tidings unto me, We shall attend his burial, And rewarded ye shall be.’ 44 ‘O take the lady,’ said the king, ‘And the boy shall be free;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ then Johnny cried, ‘To join my love and me.’ 45 ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ the king replied, ‘To seal her tocher wi thee;’ Out it speaks auld Johnny then, These words pronounced he: 46 ‘I want nae lands and rents at hame, I'll ask nae gowd frae thee; I am possessd o riches great, Hae fifty ploughs and three; Likewise fa's heir to ane estate At the foot o Benachie. 47 ‘Hae ye ony masons in this place, Or ony at your call, That ye may now send some o them To build your broken wall?’ 48 ‘Yes, there are masons in this place, And plenty at my call; But ye may gang frae whence ye came, Never mind my broken wall.’ 49 They've taen the lady by the hand And set her prison-free; Wi drums beating, and fifes playing, They spent the night wi glee. 50 Now auld Johnny Moir, and young Johnny Moir, And Jock o Noth, a' three, The English lady, and little wee boy, Went a' to Benachie. 252 THE KITCHIE-BOY THE KITCHIE-BOY—A Skene MS., p. 89; taken down in the north of Scotland, 1802-3. 1 There was a lady fair, An een a lady of birth an fame, She eyed her father's kitchen-boy, The greater was her shame. 2 She could never her love reveal, Nor to him talk, But in the forest wide an brade, Where they were wont to walk. 3 It fell ance upon a day Her father gaed frae home, And she sent for the kitchen-boy To her own room. 4 ‘Canna ye fancy me, Willie?

I fear they wad gar me die.’ 10 ‘The master-cook may on ye call, But answerd he will never be, 11 ‘For I hae three coffers fu o goud, Yer eyen did never see, An I will build a bonny ship for my love. An set her to the sea, And sail she east or sail she wast The ship sal be fair to see.’ 12 She has built a bonny ship, And set her to the sea; The topmasts war o the red goud, The sails of tafetie. 13 She gae him a gay goud ring, To mind him on a gay lady That ance bear love to him. 14 The day was fair, the ship was rare, Whan that swain set to sea; Whan that day twal-moth came and gaed, At London landed he. 15 A lady looked our the castle-wa, Beheld the day gae down, And she beheld that bonny ship Come hailing to the town. 16 ‘Come here, come here, my maries a', Ye see na what I see; The bonniest ship is come to land Yer eyes did ever see. 17 ‘Gae busk ye, busk ye, my maries a', Busk ye unco fine, Till I gae down to yon shore-side, To invite yon squar to dine. 18 ‘O ye come up, gay young squar, An take wi me a dine; Ye sal eat o the guid white loaf, An drink the claret wine.’ 19 ‘I thank ye for yer bread, I thank ye for yer wine, I thank ye for yer courticie, But indeed I hanna time.’ 20 ‘Canna ye fancy me?’ she says, ‘Canna ye fancy me?

Or gat ye it on the land? O gat ye it on the shore laying, On a drowned man's hand?’ 35 ‘I got na it on the sea sailing, I got na it on the land, But I got it on the shore lying, On a drowned man's hand. 36 ‘O bonny was his cheek, An lovely was his face!’ ‘Allas!’ says she, ‘it is my true-love Willie,’ 37 He turned him round about, An sweetly could he smile; She turned her round, says, My love Willie, How could ye me beguile? 38 ‘A priest! a priest!’ the old man cries, ‘An lat this twa married be:’ Little did the old man kin It was his ain kitchen-boy. Earl Richard's Daughter THE KITCHIE-BOY—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 145. 1 Earl Richard had but ae daughter, A maid o birth and fame; She loved her father's kitchen-boy, The greater was her shame. 2 But she could neer her true-love see, Nor with him could she talk, In towns where she had wont to go, Nor fields where she could walk. 3 But it fell ance upon a day Her father went from home; She's calld upon the kitchen boy To come and clean her room. 4 ‘Come sit ye down by me, Willie, Come sit ye down by me; There's nae a lord in a' the north That I can love but thee.’ 5 ‘Let never the like be heard, lady, Nor let it ever be; For if your father get word o this He will gar hang me hie.’ 6 ‘O ye shall neer be hangd, Willie, Your blude shall neer be drawn; I'll lay my life in pledge o thine Your body's neer get wrang.’ 7 ‘Excuse me now, my comely dame, No langer here I'll stay; You know my time is near expir'd, And now I must away. 8 ‘The master-cook will on me call, And answered he must be; If I am found in bower with thee, Great anger will there be.’ 9 ‘The master-cook will on you call, But shall not answerd be; I'll put you in a higher place Than any cook's degree. 10 ‘I have a coffer full of gold, Another of white monie, And I will build a bonny ship, And set my love to sea. 11 ‘Silk shall be your sailing-clothes, Gold yellow is your hair, As white like milk are your twa hands, Your body neat and fair.’ 12 This lady, with her fair speeches, She made the boy grow bold, And he began to kiss and clap, And on his love lay hold. 13 And she has built a bonny ship, Set her love to the sea, Seven score o brisk young men To bear him companie. 14 Then she's taen out a gay gold ring, To him she did it gie: ‘This will mind you on the ladie, Willie, That's laid her love on thee.’ 15 Then he's taen out a piece of gold, And he brake it in two: ‘All I have in the world, my dame, For love I give to you.’ 16 Now he is to his bonny ship, And merrily taen the sea; The lady lay oer castle-wa, The tear blinded her ee. 17 They had not saild upon the sea A week but barely three When came a prosperous gale of wind, On Spain's coast landed he. 18 A lady lay oer castle-wa, Beholding dale and down, And she beheld the bonny ship Come sailing to the town. 19 ‘Come here, come here, my maries a', Ye see not what I see; For here I see the bonniest ship That ever saild the sea. 20 ‘In her there is the bravest squire That eer my eyes did see; All clad in silk and rich attire, And comely, comely's he. 21 ‘O busk, O busk, my maries all, O busk and make ye fine; And we will on to yon shore-side, Invite yon squire to dine. 22 ‘Will ye come up to my castle Wi me and take your dine? And ye shall eat the gude white bread, And drink the claret wine.’ 23 ‘I thank you for your bread, lady, I thank you for your wine; I thank you for your kind offer, But now I have not time.’ 24 ‘I would gie all my land,’ she says, ‘Your gay bride were I she; And then to live on a small portion Contented I would be.’ 25 ‘She's far awa frae me, lady, She's far awa frae me That has my heart a-keeping fast, And my love still she'll be.’ 26 ‘But ladies they are unconstant, When their loves go to sea, And she'll be wed ere ye gae back; My love, pray stay wi me.’ 27 ‘If she be wed ere I go back, And prove sae false to me, I shall live single all my life; I'll neer wed one but she.’ 28 Then she's taen out a gay gold ring, And gae him presentlie: ‘'Twill mind you on the lady, young man, That laid her love on thee.’ 29 ‘The ring that's on my mid-finger Is far dearer to me, Tho yours were o the gude red gold, And mine the metal free.’ 30 He viewd them all, baith neat and small, As they stood on the shore, Then hoist the mainsail to the wind, Adieu, for evermore! 31 He had not saild upon the sea A week but barely three Until there came a prosperous gale, In Scotland landed he. 32 But he put paint upon his face, And oil upon his hair, Likewise a mask above his brow, Which did disguise him sair. 33 Earl Richard lay oer castle-wa, Beholding dale and down, And he beheld the bonny ship Come sailing to the town. 34 ‘Come here, come here, my daughter dear, Ye see not what I see; For here I see the bonniest ship That ever saild the sea. 35 ‘In her there is the bravest squire That eer my eyes did see; O busk, O busk, my daughter dear, Come here, come here, to me. 36 ‘O busk, O busk, my daughter dear, O busk, and make ye fine, And we will on to the shore-side, Invite yon squire to dine.’ 37 ‘He's far awa frae me, father, He's far awa frae me Who has the keeping o my heart, And I'll wed nane but he.’ 38 ‘Whoever has your heart in hand, Yon lad's the match for thee, And he shall come to my castle This day and dine wi me. 39 ‘Will ye come up to my castle With me and take your dine? And ye shall eat the gude white bread, And drink the claret wine.’ 40 ‘Yes, I'll come up to your castle With you and take my dine, For I would give my bonny ship Were your fair daughter mine.’ 41 ‘I would give all my lands,’ he said, ‘That your bride she would be; Then to live on a small portion Contented would I be.’ 42 As they gaed up from yon sea-strand And down the bowling-green, He drew the mask out-oer his face, For fear he should be seen. 43 He's done him down from bower to bower, Likewise from bower to ha, And there he saw that lady gay, The flower out-oer them a'. 44 He's taen her in his arms twa, And haild her courteouslie: ‘Excuse me, sir, there's no strange man Such freedom use with me.’ 45 Her father turnd him round about, A light laugh then gave he: ‘Stay, I'll retire a little while, Perhaps you may agree.’ 46 Now Willie's taen a gay gold ring, And gave her presentlie; Says, Take ye that, ye lady fair, A love-token from me. 47 ‘O got ye't on the sea sailing? Or got ye't on the sand? Or got ye't on the coast of Spain, Upon a dead man's hand?’ 48 ‘Fine silk it was his sailing-clothes, Gold yellow was his hair; It would hae made a hale heart bleed To see him lying there. 49 ‘He was not dead as I passd by, But no remeid could be; He gave me this token to bear Unto a fair ladie. 50 ‘And by the marks he has descryvd I'm sure that you are she; So take this token of free will, For him you'll never see.’ 51 In sorrow she tore her mantle, With care she tore her hair: ‘Now since I've lost my own true-love, I'll neer love young men mair.’ 52 He drew the mask from off his face, The lady sweetly smiled: ‘Awa, awa, ye fause Willie! How have you me beguiled?’ 53 Earl Richard he went thro the ha, The wine-glass in his hand, But little thought his kitchen-boy Was heir oer a' his land. 54 But this she kept within her heart, And never told to one Until nine months they were expir'd, That her young son came home. 55 She told it to her father dear; he said, Daughter, well won; You've married for love, not for gold, Your joys will neer be done. Bonny Foot-Boy THE KITCHIE-BOY—C Alexander Fraser Tytler's Brown MS., No 7. 1 O there was a ladie, a noble ladie, She was a ladie of birth and fame, But she fell in love wi her father's foot-boy, I wis she was the mair to blame. 2 A word of him she neer could get Till her father was a hunting gone; Then she calld on the bonny foot-boy To speak wi her in her bower alone. 3 Says, Ye ken you are my love, Willie, And that I am a ladie free, And there's naething ye can ask, Willie, But at your bidding I maun be. 4 O the loving looks that ladie gave Soon made the bonny boy grow bold, And the loving words that ladie spake As soon on them he did lay hold. 5 She has taen a ring frae her white finger, And unto him she did it gie; Says, Wear this token for my sake, And keep it till the day you die. 6 ‘But shoud my father get word of this I fear we baith will have cause to rue, For to some nunnery I shoud be sent, And I fear, my love, he would ruin you. 7 ‘But here is a coffer of the good red gowd, I wot my mother left it to me; And wi it you'll buy a bonny ship, And ye maun sail the raging sea; Then like some earl or baron's son You can come back and marrie me. 8 ‘But stay not lang awa, Willie, O stay not lang across the fame, For fear your ladie shoud lighter be, Or your young son shoud want a name.’ 9 He had not been o the sea sailling But till three months were come and gane, Till he has landed his bonny ship; It was upon the coast of Spain. 10 There was a ladie of high degree That saw him walking up and down; She fell in love wi sweet Willie, But she wist no how to make it known. 11 She has calld up her maries a', Says, Hearken well to what I say; There is a young man in yon ship That has been my love this many a day. 12 ‘Now bear a hand, my maries a', And busk me brave and make me fine, And go wi me to yon shore-side To invite that noble youth to dine.’ 13 O they have buskit that ladie gay In velvet pall and jewels rare; A poor man might have been made rich Wi half the pearles they pat in her hair. 14 Her mantle was of gowd sae red, It glaned as far as ane coud see; Sweet Willie thought she had been the queen, And bowd full low and bent his knee. 15 She's gard her maries step aside, And on sweet Willie sae did smile; She thought that man was not on earth But of his heart she could beguile. 16 Says, Ye maun leave your bonny ship And go this day wi me and dine, And you shall eat the baken meat, And you shall drink the Spanish wine. 17 ‘I canna leave my bonny ship, Nor go this day to dine wi thee, For a' my sails are ready bent To bear me back to my ain countrie.’ 18 ‘O gin you'd forsake your bonny ship And wed a ladie of this countrie, I would make you lord of a' this town, And towns and castles twa or three.’ 19 ‘Should I wed a ladie of this countrie, In sooth I woud be sair to blame, For the fairest ladie in fair Scotland Woud break her heart gin I gaed na hame.’ 20 ‘That ladie may choose another lord, And you another love may choose; There is not a lord in this countrie That such a proffer could refuse.’ 21 ‘O ladie, shoud I your proffer take, You'd soon yoursell have cause to rue, For the man that his first love forsakes Would to a seccond neer prove true.’ 22 She has taen a ring frae her white finger, It might have been a prince's fee; Says, Wear this token for my sake, And give me that which now I see. 23 ‘Take back your token, ye ladie fair; This ring you see on my right hand Was gien me by my ain true-love, Before I left my native land. 24 ‘And tho yours woud buy it nine times oer I far more dearly prize my ain; Nor woud I make the niffer,’ he says, ‘For a' the gowd that is in Spain.’ 25 The ladie turnd her head away To dry the sat tears frae her eyne; She naething more to him did say But, I wish your face I neer had seen! 26 He has set his foot on good ship-board, The ladie waved her milk-white hand, The wind sprang up and filld his sails, And he quickly left the Spanish land. 27 He soon came back to his native strand, He langd his ain true-love to see; Her father saw him come to land, And took him some great lord to be. 28 Says, Will ye leave your bonny ship And come wi me this day to dine? And you shall eat the baken meat, And you shall drink the claret wine. 29 ‘O I will leave my bonny ship, And gladly go wi you to dine, And I woud gie thrice three thousand pounds That your fair daughter were but mine.’ 30 ‘O gin ye will part wi your bonny ship And wed a ladie of this countrie, I will gie you my ae daughter, Gin she'll consent your bride to be.’ 31 O he has blaket his bonny face And closs tuckd up his yellow hair; His true-love met them at the yate, But she little thought her love was there. 32 ‘O will you marrie this lord, daughter, That I've brought hame to dine wi me? You shall be heir of a' my lands, Gin you'll consent his bride to be.’ 33 She looked oer her left shoulder, I wot the tears stood in her eye; Says, The man is on the sea sailling That fair wedding shall get of me. 34 Then Willie has washd his bonny face, And he's kaimd down his yellow hair; He took his true-love in his arms, And kindly has he kissd her there. 35 She's looked in his bonny face, And thro her tears did sweetly smile, Then sayd, Awa, awa, Willie! How could you thus your love beguile? 36 She kept the secret in her breast, Full seven years she's kept the same, Till it fell out at a christning-feast, And then of it she made good game. 37 And her father laughd aboon the rest, And said, My daughter, you'r nae to blame; For you've married for love, and no for land, So a' my gowd is yours to claim. The Kitchie-Boy THE KITCHIE-BOY—D Harris MS., fol. 21; from the recitation of Mrs Harris and others. 1 There lived a lady in the north O muckle birth an fame; She's faun in love wi her kitchie-boy, The greater was her shame. 2 ‘Maister cook, he will cry oot, An answered he maun be;’ 3 ‘I hae a coffer o ried gowd My mither left to me, An I will build a bonnie ship, And send her ower the sea, An you'll come hame like lord or squire, An answered you maun be.’ 4 She has biggit a bonnie ship, Sent her across the main, An in less than sax months an a day That ship cam back again. 5 ‘Go dress, go dress, my dochter Janet, Go dress, an mak you fine, An we'll go doun to yon shore-side An bid yon lords to dine.’ 6 He's pued the black mask ower his face, Kaimed doun his yellow hair, A' no to lat her father ken That ere he had been there. 7 ‘Oh, got you that by sea sailin? Or got you that by land? Or got you that on Spanish coast, Upon a died man's hand?’ 8 ‘I got na that by sea sailin, I got na that by land; But I got that on Spanish coast, Upon a died man's hand.’ 9 He's pued the black mask aff his face, Threw back his yellow hair, 10 ‘A priest, a priest,’ the lady she cried, ‘To marry my love an me;’ ‘A clerk, a clerk,’ her father cried, ‘To sign her tocher free.’ Willie, the Kitchie-Boy THE KITCHIE-BOY—E Joseph Robertson's Note-Book “Adversaria,” p. 88; from tradition. 1 And she has built a lofty ship, And set her to the main; The masts o her were o gude reed gowd, And the sails o silver clear. 2 ‘Ye winna bide three months awa When ye'll return again, In case your lady lichter be, And your baby want the name.’ 3 But the wind blew high, The mariners they did land at Lundin soon. 4 A lady sat on the castell-wa, Beheld baith dale and down, And there she saw this lofty ship, Comin sailin in the Downs. 5 ‘Look out, look out, my maidens a', Ye seena what I see; For I do see as bonny a ship As ever sailed the sea, And the master o her's the bonniest boy That ever my eyes did see.’ 6 She's taen her mantell her about, Her cane intill her han, And she's away to the shore-side, Till invite the square to dine. 7 ‘O will ye come to our castell? Or will ye sup or dine?’ ‘O excuse me, madam,’ he said, ‘For I hae but little time.’ 8 The wind blew high, The mariners they did land at home again. 9 The old man sat in the castell-wa, Beholding dale and down, And there he spied this goodly ship Come sailin to the town. 10 ‘Look out, look out, my dauchter dear, Ye see not what I see; For I do see as bonny a ship As ever sailed the sea. 11 ‘And the master o her's the bonniest boy That my eyes did ever see, And if I were a woman as I'm a man My husband he should be.’ 12 ‘Haud far awa frae me, fader, Haud far awa frae me, For I never had a lad but ane, And he's far awa at sea. 13 ‘There is a love-token atween us twa, It'll be mair ere it be less, An aye the langer he bides awa It will the mair encreass.’ 14 He's taen his mantell him about, His cane intil his hand, And he's awa to the shore-side, To invite the square to dine. 15 ‘O will ye come to our castle? Or will ye sup or dine?’ ‘Indeed I will, kind sir,’ he said, ‘Tho I've but little time.’ 16 The lady sat on castle-wa, Beholding dale and down, But he's put his veil upon his face, That she might not him ken. 253 THOMAS O YONDERDALE THOMAS O YONDERDALE a. Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 221. b. Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 96. 1 Lady Maisry lives intill a bower, She never wore but what she would; Her gowns were o the silks sae fine, Her coats stood up wi bolts o gold. 2 Mony a knight there courted her, And gentlemen o high degree, But it was Thomas o Yonderdale That gaind the love o this ladie. 3 Now he has hunted her till her bower, Baith late at night and the mid day, But when he stole her virgin rose Nae mair this maid he would come nigh. 4 But it fell ance upon a time Thomas her bower he walkëd by; There he saw her Lady Maisry, Nursing her young son on her knee. 5 ‘O seal on you, my bonny babe, And lang may ye my comfort be! Your father passes by our bower, And now minds neither you nor me.’ 6 Now when Thomas heard her speak, The saut tear trinkled frae his ee; To Lady Maisry's bower he went, Says, Now I'm come to comfort thee. 7 ‘Is this the promise ye did make Last when I was in your companie? You said before nine months were gane Your wedded wife that I should be.’ 8 ‘If Saturday be a bonny day, Then, my love, I maun sail the sea; But if I live for to return, O then, my love, I'll marry thee.’ 9 ‘I wish Saturday a stormy day, High and stormy be the sea, Ships may not sail, nor boats row, But gar true Thomas stay wi me.’ 10 Saturday was a bonny day, Fair and leesome blew the wind; Ships did sail, and boats did row, Which had true Thomas to unco ground. 11 He hadna been on unco ground A month, a month but barely three, Till he has courted anither maid, And quite forgotten Lady Maisry. 12 Ae night as he lay on his bed, In a dreary dream dreamed he That Maisry stood by his bedside, Upbraiding him for's inconstancie. 13 He's calld upon his little boy, Says, Bring me candle, that I see; And ye maun gang this night, [my] boy, Wi a letter to a gay ladie. 14 ‘It is my duty you to serve, And bring you coal and candle-light, And I would rin your errand, master, If't were to Lady Maisry bright. 15 ‘Tho my legs were sair I coudna gang, Tho the night were dark I coudna see, Tho I should creep on hands and feet, I woud gae to Lady Maisry.’ 16 ‘Win up, win up, my bonny boy, And at my bidding for to be; For ye maun quickly my errand rin, For it is to Lady Maisry. 17 ‘Ye'll bid her dress in the gowns o silk, Likewise in the coats o cramasie; Ye'll bid her come alang wi you, True Thomas's wedding for to see. 18 ‘Ye'll bid her shoe her steed before, And a' gowd graithing him behind; On ilka tip o her horse mane, Twa bonny bells to loudly ring. 19 ‘And on the tor o her saddle A courtly bird to sweetly sing; Her bridle-reins o silver fine, And stirrups by her side to hing.’ 20 She dressd her in the finest silk, Her coats were o the cramasie, And she's awa to unco land, True Thomas's wedding for to see. 21 At ilka tippet o her horse mane, Twa bonny bells did loudly ring, And on the tor o her saddle A courtly bird did sweetly sing. 22 The bells they rang, the bird he sang, As they rode in yon pleasant plain; Then soon she met true Thomas's bride, Wi a' her maidens and young men. 23 The bride she garned round about, ‘I wonder,’ said she, ‘who this may be? It surely is our Scottish queen, Come here our wedding for to see.’ 24 Out it speaks true Thomas's boy, ‘She maunna lift her head sae hie; But it's true Thomas's first love, Come here your wedding for to see.’ 25 Then out bespake true Thomas's bride, I wyte the tear did blind her ee; If this be Thomas's first true-love, I'm sair afraid he'll neer hae me. 26 Then in it came her Lady Maisry, And aye as she trips in the fleer, ‘What is your will, Thomas?’ she said, ‘This day, ye know, ye calld me here.’ 27 ‘Come hither by me, ye lily flower, Come hither and set ye down by me, For ye're the ane I've call'd upon, And ye my wedded wife maun be.’ 28 Then in it came true Thomas's bride, And aye as she trippd on the stane, ‘What is your will, Thomas?’ she said, ‘This day, ye know, ye calld me hame.’ 29 ‘Ye hae come on hired horseback, But ye'se gae hame in coach sae free; For here's the flower into my bower I mean my wedded wife shall be.’ 30 ‘O ye will break your lands, Thomas, And part them in divisions three; Gie twa o them to your ae brother, And cause your brother marry me.’ 31 ‘I winna break my lands,’ he said, ‘For ony woman that I see; My brother's a knight o wealth and might, He'll wed nane but he will for me.’ 254 LORD WILLIAM, OR, LORD LUNDY Sweet William LORD WILLIAM, OR, LORD LUNDYA Motherwell's MS., p. 361; from the recitation of Agnes Lyle, an old woman of Kilbarchan. 1 Sweet William's gone over seas, Some unco lair to learn, And our gude Bailie's ae dochter Is awa to learn the same. 2 In one broad buke they learned baith, In one broad bed they lay; But when her father came to know He gart her come away. 3 ‘It's you must marry that Southland lord, His lady for to be; It's ye maun marry that Southland lord, Or nocht ye'll get frae me.’ 4 ‘I must marry that Southland lord, Father, an it be your will; But I rather it were my burial-day, My grave for to fill.’ 5 She walked up, she walked down, Had none to make her moan, Nothing but the pretty bird Sat on the causey-stone. 6 ‘If thou could speak, wee bird,’ she says, ‘As weell as thou can flee, I would write a long letter To Will ayont the sea.’ 7 ‘What thou wants wi Will,’ it says, ‘Thou'll seal it with thy ring, Tak a thread o silk and anither o twine, About my neck will hing.’ 8 What she wanted wi Willie She sealed it wi a ring, Took a thread of silk, another o twine, About its neck did hing. 9 This bird flew high, this bird flew low, This bird flew owre the sea, Until it entered the same room Wherein was Sweet Willie. 10 This bird flew high, this bird flew low, Poor bird, it was mistaen! It let the letter fa on Baldie's breist, Instead of Sweet William. 11 ‘Here's a letter, William,’ he says, ‘I'm sure it's not to me; And gin the morn gin twelve o'clock Your love shall married be.’ 12 ‘Come saddle to me my horse,’ he said, ‘The brown and a' that's speedie, And I'll awa to Old England, To bring home my ladie.’ 13 Awa he gaed, awa he rade, Awa wi mickle speed; He lichtit at every twa miles' end, Lichtit and changed his steed. 14 When she entered the church-style, The tear was in her ee; But when she entered the church-door A blythe sicht did she see. 15 ‘O hold your hand, you minister, Hold it a little wee, Till I speak wi the bonnie bride, For she's a friend to me. 16 ‘Stand off, stand off, you braw bridegroom, Stand off a little wee; Stand off, stand off, you braw bridegroom, For the bride shall join wi me.’ 17 Up and spak the bride's father, And an angry man was he; ‘If I had pistol, powther and lead, And all at my command, I would shoot thee stiff and dead In the place where thou dost stand.’ 18 Up and spoke then Sweet William, And a blithe blink from his ee; ‘If ye neer be shot till I shoot you, Ye'se neer be shot for me. 19 ‘Come out, come out, my foremost man, And lift my lady on; Commend me all to my good-mother, At night when ye gang home.’ Lord Lundy LORD WILLIAM, OR, LORD LUNDY—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 57. 1 Lord William has but ae dear son, In this world had nae mair; Lord Lundie had but ae daughter, And he will hae nane but her. 2 They dressed up in maids' array, And passd for sisters fair; With ae consent gaed ower the sea, For to seek after lear. 3 They baith did eat at ae braid board, In ae bed baith did lye; When Lord Lundie got word o that, He's taen her soon away. 4 When Lord Lundie got word of that, An angry man was he; He wrote his daughter on great haste To return right speedilie. 5 When she looked the letter upon, A light laugh then gae she; But ere she read it till an end The tear blinded her ee. 6 ‘Bad news, bad news, my love Willie, Bad news is come to me; My father's written a braid letter, Bids me gae speedilie. 7 ‘Set trysts, set trysts, my love Willie, Set trysts, I pray, wi me; Set trysts, set trysts, my love Willie, When will our wedding be.’ 8 ‘On Wednesday, on Wednesday, The first that ever ye see; On Wednesday at twelve o'clock, My dear, I'll meet wi thee.’ 9 When she came to her father's ha, He hailed her courteouslie; Says, I'll forgie offences past, If now ye'll answer me. 10 ‘Will ye marry yon young prince, Queen of England to be? Or will you marry Lord William's son, Be loved by nane but he?’ 11 ‘I will marry yon young prince, Father, if it be your will; But I woud rather I were dead and gane, My grave I woud win till.’ 12 When she was in her saddle set, She skyred like the fire, To go her bridegroom for to meet, For whom she'd nae desire. 13 On every tippet o her horse mane There hang a siller bell, And whether the wind blew east or west They gae a sundry knell. 14 And when she came to Mary's kirk She skyred like the fire; There her young bridegroom she did meet, For whom she'd nae desire. 15 She looked ower her left shoulder, The tear blinded her ee; But looking ower her right shoulder, A blythe sight then saw she. 16 There she saw Lord William's son, And mony a man him wi, Wi targes braid and glittering spears All marching ower the lee. 17 The minister looked on a book Her marriage to begin: ‘If there is naething to be said, These two may join in ane.’ 18 ‘O huly, huly, sir,’ she said, ‘O stay a little wee; I hae a friend to welcome yet That's been a dear friend to me.’ 19 O then the parson he spake out, A wise word then spake he; ‘You might hae had your friends welcomd Before ye'd come to me.’ 20 Then in it came the bride's first love, And mony a man him wi: ‘Stand back, stand back, ye jelly bridegroom, Bride, ye maun join wi me.’ 21 Then out it speaks him Lord Lundie, An angry man was he; ‘Lord William's son will hae my daughter Without leave askd of me. 22 ‘But since it's sae that she will gang, And proved sae fause to thee, I'll make a vow, and keep it true, Nae portion shall I gie.’ 23 Then out it speaks the bride's first love, And [a] light laugh then gae he; ‘I've got the best portion now, my lord, That ye can gie to me. 24 ‘Your gude red gold I value not, Nor yet your white monie; I hae her by the hand this day That's far dearer to me. 25 ‘So gie the prince a coffer o gold When he gaes to his bed, And bid him clap his coffer o gold, And I'll clap my bonny bride.’ Lord William LORD WILLIAM, OR, LORD LUNDY—C Buchan's MSS, II, 126. 1 Lord William has gane oer the sea For to seek after lear; Lord Lundie had but ae daughter, And he'd wed nane but her. 2 Upon a book they both did read, And in ae bed did ly: ‘But if my father get word of this, I'll soon be taen away.’ 3 ‘Your father's gotten word of this, Soon married then ye'll be; Set trysts, set trysts wi me, Janet, Set trysts, set trysts wi me. 4 ‘Set trysts, set trysts wi me, Janet, When your wedding-day's to be; ‘On Saturday, the first that comes, Must be my wedding-day.’ 5 ‘Bad news, bad news is come, Janet, Bad news is come to me; Your father's gotten word of this, Soon married then ye'll be.’ 6 ‘O will ye marry the young prince, daughter, The queen of England to be? Or will ye marry Lord William, And die immediately?’ 7 ‘O I will marry the young prince, father, Because it is your will; But I wish it was my burial-day, For my grave I could gang till.’ 8 When they gaed in into the kirk, And ae seat they sat in, The minister took up the book, The marriage to begin. 9 ‘Lay down the book, O dear, kind sir, And wait a little wee; I have a lady to welcome yet, She's been a good friend to me.’ 10 Out then spake the minister, An angry man was he; ‘You might have had your ladies welcomd Before ye came to me.’ 11 She looked oer her left shoulder, And tears did blind her ee; But she looked oer her right shoulder, And a blythe sight saw she, For in there came him Lord William, And his valiant company. 12 And in there came him Lord William, His armour shining clear, And in it came him Lord William, And many glittering spear. 13 ‘Stand by, stand by, ye bonny bridegroom, Stand by, stand by,’ said he; ‘Stand by, stand by, ye bonny bridegroom, Bride, ye maun join wi me. 14 ‘Let the young prince clap his coffer of gold When he gangs to his bed; Let the young prince clap his coffer of gold, But I'll clap my bonny bride.’ 15 Out it spake him Lord Lundie, And an angry man was he; ‘My daughter will marry him Lord William, It seems, in spite of me.’ 255 WILLIE'S FATAL VISIT WILLIE'S FATAL VISIT Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 259. 1 'Twas on an evening fair I went to take the air, I heard a maid making her moan; Said, Saw ye my father? Or saw ye my mother? Or saw ye my brother John? Or saw ye the lad that I love best, And his name it is Sweet William? 2 ‘I saw not your father, I saw not your mother, Nor saw I your brother John; But I saw the lad that ye love best, And his name it is Sweet William.’ 3 ‘O was my love riding? or was he running? Or was he walking alone? Or says he that he will be here this night? O dear, but he tarries long!’ 4 ‘Your love was not riding, nor yet was he running, But fast was he walking alone; He says that he will be here this night to thee, And forbids you to think long.’ 5 Then Willie he has gane to his love's door, And gently tirled the pin: ‘O sleep ye, wake ye, my bonny Meggie, Ye'll rise, lat your true love in.’ 6 The lassie being swack ran to the door fu snack, And gently she lifted the pin, Then into her arms sae large and sae lang She embraced her bonny love in. 7 ‘O will ye gang to the cards or the dice, Or to a table o wine? Or will ye gang to a well-made bed, Well coverd wi blankets fine?’ 8 ‘O I winna gang to the cards nor the dice, Nor yet to a table o wine; But I'll rather gang to a well-made bed, Well coverd wi blankets fine.’ 9 ‘My braw little cock, sits on the house tap, Ye'll craw not till it be day, And your kame shall be o the gude red gowd, And your wings o the siller grey.’ 10 The cock being fause untrue he was, And he crew an hour ower seen; They thought it was the gude day-light, But it was but the light o the meen. 11 ‘Ohon, alas!’ says bonny Meggie then, ‘This night we hae sleeped ower lang!’ ‘O what is the matter?’ then Willie replied, ‘The faster then I must gang.’ 12 Then Sweet Willie raise, and put on his claise, And drew till him stockings and sheen, And took by his side his berry-brown sword, And ower yon lang hill he's gane. 13 As he gaed ower yon high, high hill, And down yon dowie den, Great and grievous was the ghost he saw, Would fear ten thousand men. 14 As he gaed in by Mary kirk, And in by Mary stile, Wan and weary was the ghost Upon sweet Willie did smile. 15 ‘Aft hae ye travelld this road, Willie, Aft hae ye travelld in sin; Ye neer said sae muckle for your saul As My Maker bring me hame! 16 ‘Aft hae ye travelld this road, Willie, Your bonny love to see; But ye'll never travel this road again Till ye leave a token wi me.’ 17 Then she has taen him Sweet Willie, Riven him frae gair to gair, And on ilka seat o Mary's kirk O Willie she hang a share; Even abeen his love Meggie's dice, Hang's head and yellow hair. 18 His father made moan, his mother made moan, But Meggie made muckle mair; His father made moan, his mother made moan, But Meggie reave her yellow hair. 256 ALISON AND WILLIE ALISON AND WILLIE a. ‘My luve she lives in Lincolnshire,’ Harris MS., fol. 18 b; Mrs Harris. b. ‘Alison’ Buchan's MSS., I, 231. 1 ‘My luve she lives in Lincolnshire, I wat she's neither black nor broun, But her hair is like the thread o gowd, Aye an it waur weel kaimëd doun.’ 2 She's pued the black mask owre her face, An blinkit gaily wi her ee: ‘O will you to my weddin come, An will you bear me gude companie?’ 3 ‘I winna to your weddin come, Nor [will] I bear you gude companie, Unless you be the bride yoursell, An me the bridegroom to be.’ 4 ‘For me to be the bride mysel, An you the bonnie bridegroom to be — Cheer up your heart, Sweet Willie,’ she said, ‘For that's the day you'll never see. 5 ‘Gin you waur on your saiddle set, An gaily ridin on the way, You'll hae nae mair mind o Alison Than she waur dead an laid in clay.’ 6 When he was on his saiddle set, An slowly ridin on the way, He had mair mind o Alison Than he had o the licht o day. 7 He saw a hart draw near a hare, An aye that hare drew near a toun, An that same hart did get a hare, But the gentle knicht got neer a toun. 8 He leant him owre his saiddle-bow, An his heart did brak in pieces three; Wi sighen said him Sweet Willie, ‘The pains o luve hae taen hald o me.’ 9 There cam a white horse an a letter, That stopped the weddin speidilie. 10 She leant her back on her bed-side, An her heart did brak in pieces three; She was buried an bemoaned, But the birds waur Willie's companie. 257 BURD ISABEL AND EARL PATRICK Burd Bell BURD ISABEL AND EARL PATRICK—A Kinloch MSS, I, 211; “obtained in the North Country, from the recitation of Mrs Charles.” 1 There is a stane in yon water, It's lang or it grow green; It's a maid that maks her ain fortune, It'll never end its leen. 2 Burd Bell was na full fyfteen Till to service she did gae; Burd Bell was na full sixteen Till big wi bairn was scho. 3 ‘Burd Bell she is a gude woman, She bides at hame wi me; She never seeks to gang to church, But bides at hame wi me.’ 4 It fell ance upon a day She fell in travail-pain; He is gane to the stair-head Some ladies to call in. 5 ‘O gin ye hae a lass-bairn, Burd Bell, A lass-bairn though it be, Twenty ploughs bot and a mill Will mak ye lady free. 6 ‘But gin ye hae a son, Burd Bell, Ye'se be my wedded wife, 7 The knichts they knack their white fingers, The ladies sat and sang, T was a' to cheer bonnie Burd Bell, She was far sunk in pain. 8 Earl Patrick is to his mither gane, As fast as he could hie: ‘An askin, an askin, dear mither, An askin I want frae thee. 9 ‘Burd Bell has born to me a son; What sall I do her wi?’ ‘Gie her what ye like, Patrick, Mak na her your ladie.’ 10 He has gane to bonnie Burd Bell, Hir heart was pressd wi care: 11 ‘My father will dee, bonnie Burd Bell, My mither will do the same, And whan ye hear that they are gane It's then I'll bring ye hame.’ 12 Earl Patrick's bigget to her a bour, And strawn it round wi sand; He coverd it wi silver on the outside, Wi the red gowd within. 13 It happened ance upon a day She was kaiming his yellow hair, 14 ‘Your father is dead, Earl Patrick, Your mither is the same; And what is the reason, Earl Patrick, Ye winna tak me hame?’ 15 ‘I've bigget to you a bonnie bour, I've strawn it round wi sand; I've coverd it wi silver on the outside, Wi gude red gowd within. 16 ‘If eer I marry anither woman, Or bring anither hame, I wish a hundred evils may enter me, And may I fa oure the brim!’ 17 It was na very lang after this That a duke's dochter he's wed, Wi a waggon fu of gowd 18 Burd Bell lookit oure her castle-wa, And spied baith dale and down, And there she saw Earl patrick's aunt Come riding to the town. 19 ‘What want ye here, Earl Patrick's aunt?

Burd Isbel and Sir Patrick BURD ISABEL AND EARL PATRICK—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 76. 1 Take warning, a' ye young women, Of low station or hie, Lay never your love upon a man Above your ain degree. 2 Thus I speak by Burd Isbel; She was a maid sae fair, She laid her love on Sir Patrick, She'll rue it for evermair. 3 And likewise, a' ye sprightly youths, Of low station or hie, Lay never your love upon a maid Below your ain degree. 4 And thus I speak by Sir Patrick, Who was a knight sae rare; He's laid his love on Burd Isbel, He'll rue it for evermair. 5 Burd Isbel was but ten years auld, To service she has gane; And Burd Isbel was but fifeteen Whan her young son came hame. 6 It fell ance upon a day Strong travelling took she; None there was her bower within But Sir Patrick and she. 7 ‘This is a wark now, Sir Patrick, That we twa neer will end; Ye'll do you to the outer court And call some women in.’ 8 He's done him to the outer court, And stately there did stand; Eleven ladies he's calld in, Wi ae shake o his hand. 9 ‘Be favourable to Burd Isbel, Deal favourable if ye may; Her kirking and her fair wedding Shall baith stand on ae day. 10 ‘Deal favourable to Burd Isbel, Whom I love as my life; Ere this day month be come and gane, She's be my wedded wife.’ 11 Then he is on to his father, Fell low down on his knee; Says, Will I marry Burd Isbel? She's born a son to me. 12 ‘O marry, marry Burd Isbel, Or use her as ye like; Ye'll gar her wear the silks sae red And sae may ye the white. O woud ye marry Burd Isbel, Make her your heart's delight? 13 ‘You want not lands nor rents, Patrick, You know your fortune's free; But ere you'd marry Burd Isbel I'd rather bury thee. 14 ‘Ye'll build a bower for Burd Isbel, And set it round wi sand; Make as much mirth in Isbel's bower As ony in a' the land.’ 15 Then he is to his mother gane, Fell low down on his knee: ‘O shall I marry Burd Isbel? She's born a son to me.’ 16 ‘O marry, marry Burd Isbel, Or use her as ye like; Ye'll gar her wear the silks sae red, And sae may ye the white. O would ye marry Burd Isbel, Make her wi me alike? 17 ‘You want not lands and rents, Patrick, You know your fortune's free; But ere you marry Burd Isbel I'd rather bury thee. 18 ‘Ye'll build a bower to Burd Isbel, And set it round wi glass; Make as much mirth in Isbel's bower As ony in a' the place.’ 19 He's done him down thro ha, thro ha, Sae has he in thro bower; The tears ran frae his twa grey eyes, And loot them fast down pour. 20 ‘My father and my mother baith To age are coming on; When they are dead and buried baith, Burd Isbel I'll bring home.’ 21 The words that passd atween these twa Ought never to be spoken; The vows that passd atween these twa Ought never to be broken. 22 Says he, If I another court, Or wed another wife, May eleven devils me attend At the end-day o my life. 23 But his father he soon did die, His mother nae lang behind; But Sir Patrick of Burd Isbel He now had little mind. 24 It fell ance upon a day, As she went out to walk, And there she saw him Sir Patrick, Going wi his hound and hawk. 25 ‘Stay still, stay still, now Sir Patrick, O stay a little wee, And think upon the fair promise Last year ye made to me. 26 ‘Now your father's dead, kind sir, And your mother the same; Yet nevertheless now, Sir Patrick, Ye're nae bringing me hame.’ 27 ‘If the morn be a pleasant day, I mean to sail the sea, To spend my time in fair England, All for a month or three.’ 28 He hadna been in fair England A month but barely ane Till he forgot her Burd Isbel, The mother of his son. 29 Some time he spent in fair England, And when returnd again He laid his love on a duke's daughter, And he has brought her hame. 30 Now he's forgot his first true love He ance lovd ower them a'; But now the devil did begin To work between them twa. 31 When Sir Patrick he was wed, And all set down to dine, Upon his first love, Burd Isbel, A thought ran in his mind. 32 He calld upon his gude grand-aunt To come right speedilie; Says, Ye'll gae on to Burd Isbel, Bring my young son to me. 33 She's taen her mantle her about, Wi gowd gloves on her hand, And she is on to Burd Isbel, As fast as she coud gang. 34 She haild her high, she haild her low, With stile in great degree: ‘O busk, O busk your little young son, For he maun gang wi me.’ 35 ‘I woud fain see the one,’ she said, ‘O low station or hie, Woud take the bairn frae my foot, For him I bowed my knee. 36 ‘I woud fain see the one,’ she said, ‘O low station or mean, Woud take the bairn frae my foot Whom I own to be mine.’ 37 Then she has done her hame again, As fast as gang coud she; ‘Present,’ said he, ‘my little young son, For him I wish to see.’ 38 ‘Burd Isbel's a bauld woman,’ she said, ‘As eer I yet spake wi;’ But sighing said him Sir Patrick, She ne'er was bauld to me. 39 But he's dressd in his best array, His gowd rod in his hand, And he is to Burd Isbel's bower, As fast as he coud gang. 40 ‘O how is this, Burd Isbel,’ he said, ‘So ill ye've used me? What gart you anger my gude grand-aunt, That I did send to thee?’ 41 ‘If I hae angerd your gude grand-aunt, O then sae lat it be; I said naething to your gude grand-aunt But what I'll say to thee. 42 ‘Iwoud fain see the one, I said, O low station or hie, Wha woud take this bairn frae my foot, For him I bowed the knee. 43 ‘I woud fain see the one, I said, O low station or mean, Woud take this bairn frae my foot Whom I own to be mine.’ 44 ‘O if I had some counsellers here, And clerks to seal the band, I woud infeft your son this day In third part o my land.’ 45 ‘I hae two couzins, Scottish clerks, Wi bills into their hand, An ye'll infeft my son this day In third part o your land.’ 46 Then he calld in her Scottish clerks, Wi bills into their hand, And he's infeft his son that day The third part o his land. 47 To ane o these young clerks she spoke, Clerk John it was his name; Says, Of my son I gie you charge Till I return again. 48 ‘Ye'll take here my son, clerk John, Learn him to dance and sing, And I will to some unco land, Drive love out of my mind. 49 ‘And ye'll take here my son, clerk John, Learn him to hunt the roe, And I will to some unco land; Now lat Sir Patrick go. 50 ‘But I'll cause this knight at church-door stand; For a' his noble train; For selling o his precious soul Dare never come farther ben.’ Earl Patrick and Burd Isabel BURD ISABEL AND EARL PATRICK—C Motherwell's MS., p. 440. 1 All young maidens fair and gay, Whatever your station be, Never lay your love upon a man Above your own degree. 2 I speak it all by Bird Isabel; She was her father's dear, She laid her love on Earl Patrick, Which she rues ever mair. 3 ‘Oh, we began a wark, Patrick, That we two cannot end; Go you unto the outer stair And call some women in.’ 4 He's gone unto the outer stair, And up in it did stand, And did bring in eleven ladies, With one sign of his hand. 5 He did him to the doctor's shop, As fast as he could gang, But ere the doctor could get there Bird Isabel bore a son. 6 But he has courted a duke's daughter, Lived far beyont the sea; Burd Isabel's parents were but mean, They had not gear to gie. 7 He has courted a duke's daughter, Lived far beyond the foam; Burd Isabel was a mean woman, And tocher she had none. 8 Now it fell once upon a day His wedding day was come; He's hied him to his great-grand-aunt, As fast as he could gang. 9 Says, Will you go this errand, aunt? Go you this errand for me, And if I live and bruick my life I will go as far for thee. 10 ‘Go and bring me Bird Isbel's son, Dressed in silks so fine, And if he live to be a man He shall heir all my land.’ 11 Now she went hailing to the door, And hailing ben the floor, And Isabel styled her madame, And she, her Isabel dear. 12 ‘I came to take Earl Patrick's son, To dress in silks so fine; For if he live to be a man He is to heir his land.’ 13 ‘Oh is there ever a woman,’ she said, ‘Of high station or mean, Daur take this bairn from my knee? For he is called mine. 14 ‘Oh is there ever a woman,’ she said, ‘Of mean station or hie, Daur tak this bairn frae my foot? For him I bowed my knee.’ 15 His aunt went hailing to his door, And hailing ben the floor, And she has styled him, Patrick, And [he] her, aunty dear. 16 She says, I have been east and west, And far beyond the sea, But Isabel is the boldest woman That ever my eyes did see. 17 ‘You surely dream, my aunty dear, For that can never be; Burd Isabel's not a bold woman, She never was bold to me.’ 18 Now he went hailing to her door, And hailing ben the floor, And she has styled him, Patrick, And he her, Isabel dear. 19 ‘O ye have angered my great-grand-aunt; You know she's a lady free;’ ‘I said naught to your great-grand-aunt But what I'll say to thee. 20 ‘Oh is there ever a woman, I said, Of high station or mean, Daur tak this bairn from my knee? For he is called mine. 21 ‘Oh is there ever a woman, I said, Of mean station or hie, Daur tak this bairn from my foot?

From weeping would not refrain. 9 ‘The Hiland hills are hie, hie hills, The Hiland hills are hie; They are no like the banks o Tay, Or bonny town o Dundee.’ 10 It fell out ance upon a day They went to take the air; She threw hersell upon the stream, Against wind and despair. 11 It was sae deep he coudna wide, Boats werna to be found, But he leapt in after himsell, And sunk down like a stone. 12 She kilted up her green claiding A little below her knee, And never rest nor was undrest Till she reachd again Dundee. 13 ‘I learned this at Broughty Walls, At Broughty near Dundee, That if water were my prison strong I would swim for libertie.’ 259 LORD THOMAS STUART LORD THOMAS STUART Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 1. 1 Thomas Stuart was a lord, A lord of mickle land; He used to wear a coat of gold, But now his grave is green. 2 Now he has wooed the young countess, The Countess of Balquhin, An given her for a morning-gift Strathboggie and Aboyne. 3 But women's wit is aye willful, Alas that ever it was sae! She longed to see the morning-gift That her gude lord to her gae. 4 When steeds were saddled an weel bridled, An ready for to ride, There came a pain on that gude lord, His back, likewise his side. 5 He said, Ride on, my lady fair, May goodness be your guide! For I'm sae sick an weary that No farther can I ride. 6 Now ben did come his father dear, Wearing a golden band; Says, Is there nae leech in Edinburgh Can cure my son from wrang? 7 ‘O leech is come, an leech is gane, Yet, father, I'm aye waur; There's not a leech in Edinbro Can death from me debar. 8 ‘But be a friend to my wife, father, Restore to her her own; Restore to her my morning-gift, Strathboggie and Aboyne. 9 ‘It had been gude for my wife, father, To me she'd born a son; He would have got my land an rents, Where they lie out an in. 10 ‘It had been gude for my wife, father, To me she'd born an heir; He would have got my land an rents, Where they lie fine an fair.’ 11 The steeds they strave into their stables, The boys could'nt get them bound; The hounds lay howling on the leech, Cause their master was behind. 12 ‘I dreamed a dream since late yestreen, I wish it may be good, That our chamber was full of swine, An our bed full of blood.’ 13 I saw a woman come from the West, Full sore wringing her hands, And aye she cried, Ohon, alas! My good lord's broken bands. 14 As she came by my good lord's bower, Saw mony black steeds an brown: ‘I'm feared it be mony unco lords Havin my love from town!’ 15 As she came by my gude lord's bower, Saw mony black steeds an grey: ‘I'm feared it's mony unco lords Havin my love to the clay!’ 260 LORD THOMAS AND LADY MARGARET Lord Thomas; or, Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret LORD THOMAS AND LADY MARGARET—A a.

Motherwell's MS., p. 71; from Miss—, Glasgow. 1 Lord Thomas is to the hunting gone, To hunt the fallow deer; Lady Margaret's to the greenwood shaw, To see her lover hunt there. 2 He has looked over his left shoulder, To see what might be seen, And there he saw Lady Margaret, As she was riding her lane. 3 He called on his servants all, By one, by two, by three: ‘Go hunt, go hunt that wild woman, Go hunt her far from me!’ 4 They hunted her high, they hunted her low, They hunted her over the plain, And the red scarlet robes Lady Margaret had on Would never be mended again. 5 They hunted her high, they hunted her low, They hunted her over the plain, Till at last she spy'd a tall young man, As he was riding alane. 6 ‘Some relief, some relief, thou tall young man! Some relief I pray thee grant me! For I am a lady deep wronged in love, And chased from my own countrie.’ 7 ‘No relief, no relief, thou lady fair, No relief will I grant unto thee Till once thou renounce all the men in the world My wedded wife for to be.’ 8 Then he set her on a milk-white steed, Himself upon a gray, And he has drawn his hat over his face, And chearfully they rode away. 9 Lady Margaret was at her bower-window, Sewing her silken seam, And there she spy'd, like a wandering bodie, Lord Thomas begging alane. 10 ‘Some relief, some relief, thou lady fair! Some relief, I pray thee grant me! For I am a puir auld doited carle, And banishd from my ain countrie.’ 11 ‘No relief, no relief, thou perjured man, No relief will I grant unto thee; For oh, if I had thee within my bower, There hanged dead thou would be.’ 12 ‘No such thing, Lady Margaret,’ he said, ‘Such a thing would never be; For with my broadsword I would kill thy wedded lord, And carry thee far off with me.’ 13 ‘Oh no, no! Lord Thomas,’ she said, ‘Oh, no such things must be; For I have wine in my cellars, And you must drink with me.’ 14 Lady Margaret then called her servants all, By one, by two, by three: ‘Go fetch me the bottles of blude-red wine, That Lord Thomas may drink with me.’ 15 They brought her the bottles of blude-red wine, By one, by two, by three, And with her fingers long and small She poisond them all three. 16 She took the cup in her lilly-white hand, Betwixt her finger and her thumb, She put it to her red rosy lips, But never a drop went down. 17 Then he took the cup in his manly hand, Betwixt his finger and his thumb, He put it to his red rosy lips, And so merrily it ran down. 18 ‘Oh, I am wearied drinking with thee, Margaret! I am wearied drinking with thee!’ ‘And so was I,’ Lady Margaret said, ‘When thou hunted thy hounds after me.’ 19 ‘But I will bury thee, Lord Thomas,’ she said, ‘Just as if thou wert one of my own; And when that my good lord comes home I will say thou's my sister's son.’ Clerk Tamas LORD THOMAS AND LADY MARGARET—B Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 43. 1 Clerk Tamas lovd her fair Annie As well as Mary lovd her son; But now he hates her fair Annie, And hates the lands that she lives in. 2 ‘Ohon, alas!’ said fair Annie, ‘Alas! this day I fear I'll die; But I will on to sweet Tamas, And see gin he will pity me.’ 3 As Tamas lay ower his shott-window, Just as the sun was gaen down, There he beheld her fair Annie, As she came walking to the town. 4 ‘O where are a' my well-wight men, I wat, that I pay meat and fee, For to lat a' my hounds gang loose To hunt this vile whore to the sea.’ 5 The hounds they knew the lady well, And nane o them they woud her bite, Save ane that is ca'd Gaudywhere, I wat he did the lady smite. 6 ‘O wae mat worth ye, Gaudywhere! An ill reward this is to me; For ae bit that I gae the lave, I'm very sure I've gien you three. 7 ‘For me, alas! there's nae remeid, Here comes the day that I maun die; I ken ye lovd your master well, And sae, alas for me! did I.’ 8 A captain lay ower his ship-window, Just as the sun was gaen down; There he beheld her fair Annie, As she was hunted frae the town. 9 ‘Gin ye'll forsake father and mither, And sae will ye your friends and kin, Gin ye'll forsake your lands sae broad, Then come and I will take you in.’ 10 ‘Yes, I'll forsake baith father and mither, And sae will I my friends and kin; Yes, I'll forsake my lands sae broad, And come, gin ye will take me in.’ 11 Then a' thing gaed frae fause Tamas, And there was naething byde him wi; Then he thought lang for Arrandella, It was fair Annie for to see. 12 ‘How do ye now, ye sweet Tamas? And how gaes a' in your countrie?’ ‘I'll do better to you than ever I've done, Fair Annie, gin ye'll come an see.’ 13 ‘O Guid forbid,’ said fair Annie, ‘That e'er the like fa in my hand! Woud I forsake my ain gude lord And follow you, a gae-through-land? 14 ‘Yet nevertheless now, sweet Tamas, Ye'll drink a cup o wine wi me, And nine times in the live lang day Your fair claithing shall changed be.’ 15 Fair Annie pat it till her cheek, Sae did she till her milk-white chin, Sae did she till her flattering lips, But never a drap o wine gaed in. 16 Tamas pat it till his cheek, Sae did he till his dimpled chin; He pat it till his rosy lips, And then the well o wine gaed in. 17 ‘These pains,’ said he, ‘are ill to bide; Here is the day that I maun die; O take this cup frae me, Annie, For o the same I am weary.’ 18 ‘And sae was I o you, Tamas, When I was hunted to the sea; But I'se gar bury you in state, Which is mair than ye'd done to me.’ 261 LADY ISABEL Lady Isabel LADY ISABEL Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 129. 1 'T was early on a May morning Lady Isabel combd her hair; But little kent she, or the morn She woud never comb it mair. 2 'T was early on a May morning Lady Isabel rang the keys; But little kent she, or the morn A fey woman she was. 3 Ben it came her step-mother, As white's the lily flower: ‘It's tauld me this day, Isabel, You are your father's whore.’ 4 ‘O them that tauld you that, mother, I wish they neer drink wine; For if I be the same woman My ain sell drees the pine. 5 ‘And them that's tauld you that, mother, I wish they neer drink ale; For if I be the same woman My ain sell drees the dail.’ 6 ‘It may be very well seen, Isabel, It may be very well seen; He buys to you the damask gowns, To me the dowie green.’ 7 ‘Ye are of age and I am young, And young amo my flowers; The fairer that my claithing be, The mair honour is yours. 8 ‘I hae a love beyond the sea, And far ayont the faem; For ilka gown my father buys me, My ain luve sends me ten.’ 9 ‘Come ben, come ben now, Lady Isabel, And drink the wine wi me; I hae twa jewels in ae coffer, And ane o them I'll gie [ye].’ 10 ‘Stay still, stay still, my mother dear, Stay still a little while, Till I gang into Marykirk; It's but a little mile.’ 11 When she gaed on to Marykirk, And into Mary's quire, There she saw her ain mother Sit in a gowden chair. 12 ‘O will I leave the lands, mother? Or shall I sail the sea? Or shall I drink this dowie drink That is prepar'd for me?’ 13 ‘Ye winna leave the lands, daughter, Nor will ye sail the sea, But ye will drink this dowie drink This woman's prepar'd for thee. 14 ‘Your bed is made in a better place Than ever hers will be, And ere ye're cauld into the room Ye will be there wi me.’ 15 ‘Come in, come in now, Lady Isabel, And drink the wine wi me; I hae twa jewels in ae coffer, And ane o them I'll gie [ye].’ 16 ‘Stay still, stay still, my mother dear, Stay still a little wee, Till I gang to yon garden green, My Maries a' to see.’ 17 To some she gae the broach, the broach, To some she gae a ring; But wae befa her step-mother! To her she gae nae thing. 18 ‘Come in, come in now, Lady Isabel, And drink the wine wi me; I hae twa jewels in ae coffer, And ane o them I'll gie [ye].’ 19 Slowly to the bower she came, And slowly enterd in, And being full o courtesie, Says, Begin, mother, begin. 20 She put it till her cheek, her cheek, Sae did she till her chin, Sae did she till her fu fause lips, But never a drap gaed in. 21 Lady Isabel put it till her cheek, Sae did she till her chin, Sae did she till her rosy lips, And the rank poison gaed in. 22 ‘O take this cup frae me, mother, O take this cup frae me; My bed is made in a better place Than ever yours will be. 23 ‘My bed is in the heavens high, Amang the angels fine; But yours is in the lowest hell, To drie torment and pine.’ 24 Nae moan was made for Lady Isabel In bower where she lay dead, But a' was for that ill woman, In the fields mad she gaed. 262 LORD LIVINGSTON Lord Livingston LORD LIVINGSTON Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 39. 1 It fell about the Lammas time, When wightsmen won their hay, A' the squires in merry Linkum Went a' forth till a play. 2 They playd until the evening tide, The sun was gaeing down; A lady thro plain fields was bound, A lily leesome thing. 3 Two squires that for this lady pledged, In hopes for a renown, The one was calld the proud Seaton, The other Livingston. 4 ‘When will ye, Michaell o Livingston, Wad for this lady gay?’ ‘To-morrow, to-morrow,’ said Livingston, ‘To-morrow, if you may.’ 5 Then they hae wadded their wagers, And laid their pledges down; To the high castle o Edinbro They made them ready boun. 6 The chamber that they did gang in, There it was daily dight; The kipples were like the gude red gowd, As they stood up in hight, And the roof-tree like the siller white, And shin'd like candles bright. 7 The lady fair into that ha Was comely to be seen; Her kirtle was made o the pa, Her gowns seemd o the green. 8 Her gowns seemd like green, like green, Her kirtle o the pa; A siller wand intill her hand, She marshalld ower them a'. 9 She gae every knight a lady bright, And every squire a may; Her own sell chose him Livingston, They were a comely tway. 10 Then Seaton started till his foot, The fierce flame in his ee: ‘On the next day, wi sword in hand, On plain fields meet ye me.’ 11 When bells were rung, and mass was sung, And a' man bound for bed, Lord Livingston and his fair dame In bed were sweetly laid. 12 The bed, the bed where they lay in Was coverd wi the pa; A covering o the gude red gowd Lay nightly ower the twa. 13 So they lay there, till on the morn The sun shone on their feet; Then up it raise him Livingston To draw to him a weed. 14 The first an weed that he drew on Was o the linen clear; The next an weed that he drew on, It was a weed o weir. 15 The niest an weed that he drew on Was gude iron and steel; Twa gloves o plate, a gowden helmet, Became that hind chiel weel. 16 Then out it speaks that lady gay— A little forbye stood she— ‘I'll dress mysell in men's array, Gae to the fields for thee.’ 17 ‘O God forbid,’ said Livingston, ‘That eer I dree the shame; My lady slain in plain fields, And I coward knight at hame!’ 18 He scarcely travelled frae the town A mile but barely twa Till he met wi a witch-woman, I pray to send her wae! 19 ‘This is too gude a day, my lord, To gang sae far frae town; This is too gude a day, my lord, On field to make you boun. 20 ‘I dreamd a dream concerning thee, O read ill dreams to guid! Your bower was full o milk-white swans, Your bride's bed full o bluid.’ 21 ‘O bluid is gude,’ said Livingston, ‘To bide it whoso may; If I be frae yon plain fields, Nane knew the plight I lay.’ 22 Then he rade on to plain fields As swift's his horse coud hie, And there he met the proud Seaton, Come boldly ower the lee. 23 ‘Come on to me now, Livingston, Or then take foot and flee; This is the day that we must try Who gains the victorie.’ 24 Then they fought with sword in hand Till they were bluidy men; But on the point o Seaton's sword Brave Livingston was slain. 25 His lady lay ower castle-wa, Beholding dale and down, When Blenchant brave, his gallant steed, Came prancing to the town. 26 ‘O where is now my ain gude lord He stays sae far frae me?’ ‘O dinna ye see your ain gude lord Stand bleeding by your knee?’ 27 ‘O live, O live, Lord Livingston, The space o ae half hour, There's nae a leech in Edinbro town But I'll bring to your door.’ 28 ‘Awa wi your leeches, lady,’ he said, ‘Of them I'll be the waur; There's nae a leech in Edinbro town That can strong death debar. 29 ‘Ye'll take the lands o Livingston And deal them liberallie, To the auld that may not, the young that cannot, And blind that does na see, And help young maidens' marriages, That has nae gear to gie.’ 30 ‘My mother got it in a book, The first night I was born, I woud be wedded till a knight, And him slain on the morn. 31 ‘But I will do for my love's sake What ladies woudna thole; Ere seven years shall hae an end, Nae shoe's gang on my sole. 32 ‘There's never lint gang on my head, Nor kame gang in my hair, Nor ever coal nor candle-light Shine in my bower mair.’ 33 When seven years were near an end, The lady she thought lang, And wi a crack her heart did brake, And sae this ends my sang. 263 THE NEW-SLAIN KNIGHT The New-Slain Knight THE NEW-SLAIN KNIGHT Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 197. 1 My heart is lighter than the poll; My folly made me glad, As on my rambles I went out, Near by a garden-side. 2 I walked on, and farther on, Love did my heart engage; There I spied a well-faird maid, Lay sleeping near a hedge. 3 Then I kissd her with my lips And stroked her with my hand: ‘Win up, win up, ye well-faird maid, This day ye sleep oer lang. 4 ‘This dreary sight that I hae seen Unto my heart gives pain; At the south side o your father's garden, I see a knight lies slain.’ 5 ‘O what like was his hawk, his hawk? Or what like was his hound? And what like was the trusty brand This new-slain knight had on?’ 6 ‘His hawk and hound were from him gone, His steed tied to a tree; A bloody brand beneath his head, And on the ground lies he.’ 7 ‘O what like was his hose, his hose? And what like were his shoon? And what like was the gay clothing This new-slain knight had on?’ 8 ‘His coat was of the red scarlet, His waistcoat of the same; His hose were of the bonny black, And shoon laced with cordin. 9 ‘Bonny was his yellow hair, For it was new combd down;’ Then, sighing sair, said the lady fair, ‘I combd it late yestreen. 10 ‘O wha will shoe my fu fair foot? Or wha will glove my hand? Or wha will father my dear bairn, Since my love's dead and gane?’ 11 ‘O I will shoe your fu fair foot, And I will glove your hand; And I'll be father to your bairn, Since your love's dead and gane.’ 12 ‘I winna father my bairn,’ she said, ‘Upon an unkent man; I'll father it on the King of Heaven, Since my love's dead and gane.’ 13 The knight he knackd his white fingers, The lady tore her hair; He's drawn the mask from off his face, Says, Lady, mourn nae mair. 14 ‘For ye are mine, and I am thine, I see your love is true; And if I live and brook my life Ye'se never hae cause to rue.’ 264 THE WHITE FISHER The White Fisher THE WHITE FISHER Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 200. 1 ‘It is a month, and isna mair, Love, sin I was at thee, But find a stirring in your side; Who may the father be? 2 ‘Is it to a lord of might, Or baron of high degree? Or is it to the little wee page That rode along wi me?’ 3 ‘It is not to a man of might, Nor baron of high degree, But it is to a popish priest; My lord, I winna lie. 4 ‘He got me in my bower alone, As I sat pensively; He vowed he would forgive my sins, If I would him obey.’ 5 Now it fell ance upon a day This young lord went from home, And great and heavy were the pains That came this lady on. 6 Then word has gane to her gude lord, As he sat at the wine, And when the tidings he did hear Then he came singing hame. 7 When he came to his own bower-door, He tirled at the pin: ‘Sleep ye, wake ye, my gay lady, Ye'll let your gude lord in.’ 8 Huly, huly raise she up, And slowly put she on, And slowly came she to the door; She was a weary woman. 9 ‘Ye'll take up my son, Willie, That ye see here wi me, And hae him down to yon shore-side, And throw him in the sea. 10 ‘Gin he sink, ye'll let him sink, Gin he swim, ye'll let him swim; And never let him return again Till white fish he bring hame.’ 11 Then he's taen up his little young son, And rowd him in a band, And he is on to his mother, As fast as he could gang. 12 ‘Ye'll open the door, my mother dear, Ye'll open, let me come in; My young son is in my arms twa, And shivering at the chin.’ 13 ‘I tauld you true, my son Willie, When ye was gaun to ride, That lady was an ill woman That ye chose for your bride.’ 14 ‘O hold your tongue, my mother dear, Let a' your folly be; I wat she is a king's daughter That's sent this son to thee. 15 ‘I wat she was a king's daughter I loved beyond the sea, And if my lady hear of this Right angry will she be.’ 16 ‘If that be true, my son Willie— Your ain tongue winna lie— Nae waur to your son will be done Than what was done to thee.’ 17 He's gane hame to his lady, And sair mourning was she: ‘What ails you now, my lady gay, Ye weep sa bitterlie?’ 18 ‘O bonny was the white fisher That I sent to the sea; But lang, lang will I look for fish Ere white fish he bring me! 19 ‘O bonny was the white fisher That ye kiest in the faem; But lang, lang will I look for fish Ere white fish he fetch hame! 20 ‘I fell a slumbering on my bed That time ye went frae me, And dreamd my young son filld my arms, But when waked, he's in the sea.’ 21 ‘O hold your tongue, my gay lady, Let a' your mourning be, And I'll gie you some fine cordial, My love, to comfort thee.’ 22 ‘I value not your fine cordial, Nor aught that ye can gie; Who could hae drownd my bonny young son Could as well poison me.’ 23 ‘Cheer up your heart, my lily flower, Think nae sic ill o me; Your young son's in my mother's bower, Set on the nourice knee. 24 ‘Now, if ye'll be a gude woman, I'll neer mind this to thee; Nae waur is done to your young son Than what was done to me.’ 25 ‘Well fell's me now, my ain gude lord; These words do cherish me; If it hadna come o yoursell, my lord, 'Twould neer hae come o me.’ 265 THE KNIGHT'S GHOST The Knight's Ghost Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 227. 1 ‘There is a fashion in this land, And even come to this country, That every lady should meet her lord When he is newly come frae sea: 2 ‘Some wi hawks, and some wi hounds, And other some wi gay monie; But I will gae myself alone, And set his young son on his knee.’ 3 She's taen her young son in her arms, And nimbly walkd by yon sea-strand, And there she spy'd her father's ship, As she was sailing to dry land. 4 ‘Where hae ye put my ain gude lord, This day he stays sae far frae me?’ ‘If ye be wanting your ain gude lord, A sight o him ye'll never see.’ 5 ‘Was he brunt? or was he shot? Or was he drowned in the sea? Or what's become o my ain gude lord, That he will neer appear to me?’ 6 ‘He wasna brunt, nor was he shot, Nor was he drowned in the sea; He was slain in Dumfermling, A fatal day to you and me.’ 7 ‘Come in, come in, my merry young men, Come in and drink the wine wi me; And a' the better ye shall fare For this gude news ye tell to me.’ 8 She's brought them down to yon cellar, She brought them fifty steps and three; She birled wi them the beer and wine, Till they were as drunk as drunk could be. 9 Then she has lockd her cellar-door, For there were fifty steps and three: ‘Lie there, wi my sad malison, For this bad news ye've tauld to me.’ 10 She's taen the keys intill her hand And threw them deep, deep in the sea: ‘Lie there, wi my sad malison, Till my gude lord return to me.’ 11 Then she sat down in her own room, And sorrow lulld her fast asleep, And up it starts her own gude lord, And even at that lady's feet. 12 ‘Take here the keys, Janet,’ he says, ‘That ye threw deep, deep in the sea; And ye'll relieve my merry young men, For they've nane o the swick o me. 13 ‘They shot the shot, and drew the stroke, And wad in red bluid to the knee; Nae sailors mair for their lord coud do Nor my young men they did for me.’ 14 ‘I hae a question at you to ask, Before that ye depart frae me; You'll tell to me what day I'll die, And what day will my burial be?’ 15 ‘I hae nae mair o God's power Than he has granted unto me; But come to heaven when ye will, There porter to you I will be. 16 ‘But ye'll be wed to a finer knight Than ever was in my degree; Unto him ye'll hae children nine, And six o them will be ladies free. 17 ‘The other three will be bold young men, To fight for king and countrie; The ane a duke, the second a knight, And third a laird o lands sae free.’</field>

I've thought lang, and very lang, And all for your fair face to see.’ 4 For some days she did with him stay, Till it fell ance upon a day, ‘Farewell for a time,’ she said, ‘For now I must bound home away.’ 5 He's gien to her a jewel fine, Was set with pearl and precious stone; Says, My love, beware of these savages bold, That's on your way as ye go home. 6 Ye'll take the road, my lady fair, That leads you fair across the lee; That keeps you from wild Hind Soldan, And likewise from base Violentrie. 7 With heavy heart these two did part, And minted as she would go home; Hind Soldan by the Greeks was slain, But to base Violentrie she's gone. 8 When a twelvemonth had expired, John Thomson he thought wondrous lang, And he has written a broad letter, And seald it well with his own hand. 9 He sent it along with a small vessel That there was quickly going to sea, And sent it on to fair Scotland, To see about his gay ladie. 10 But the answer he received again, The lines did grieve his heart right sair; None of her friends there had her seen For a twelvemonth and something mair. 11 Then he put on a palmer's weed, And took a pikestaff in his hand; To Violentrie's castle he hied, But slowly, slowly he did gang. 12 When within the hall he came, He joukd and couchd out-oer his tree: ‘If ye be lady of this hall, Some of your good bountieth give me.’ 13 ‘What news, what news, palmer?’ she said, ‘And from what countrie came ye?’ ‘I'm lately come from Grecian plains, Where lys some of the Scots army.’ 14 ‘If ye be come from Grecian plains, Some more news I will ask of thee; Of one of the chieftains that lies there, If he have lately seen his gay ladie.’ 15 ‘It is twelve months and something more Since we did part in yonder plain; And now this knight has begun to fear One of his foes he has her taen.’ 16 ‘He has not taen me by force nor might, It was all by my own free will; He may tarry in the fight, For here I mean to tarry still. 17 ‘And if John Thomson ye do see, Tell him I wish him silent sleep; His head was not so cozelie Nor yet so well as lies at my feet.’ 18 With that he threw [aff] his strange disguise, Laid by the mask that he had on; Said, Hide me now, my ladie fair, For Violentrie will soon be home. 19 ‘For the love I bare thee once, I'll strive to hide you if I can;’ Then put him down to a dark cellar, Where there lay mony a new slain man. 20 But he hadna in the cellar been Not an hour but barely three, Till hideous was the sound he heard; Then in at the gates came Violentrie. 21 Says, I wish yon well, my lady fair, It's time for us to sit and dine; Come, serve me with the good white bread, And likewise with the claret wine. 22 ‘That Scots chieftain, our mortal foe, So oft from field has made us flee, Ten thousand sequins this day I'd give That I his face could only see.’ 23 ‘Of that same gift would ye give me, If I could bring him unto thee? I fairly hold you at your word; Come ben, John Thomson, to my lord.’ 24 Then from the vault John Thomson came, Wringing his hands most piteouslie; ‘What would ye do,’ the Turk he cried, ‘If ye had me, as I have thee?’ 25 ‘If I had you, as ye have me, I'll tell you what I'd do to thee; I'd hang you up in good greenwood, And cause your own hand wile the tree. 26 ‘I meant to stick you with my knife, For kissing my beloved wife;’ ‘But that same weed ye've shaped for me, It quickly shall be sewed for thee.’ 27 Then to the wood they both are gone, John Thomson clamb from tree to tree; And aye he sighd, and said, Ohon! Here comes the day that I must die! 28 He tied a ribbon on every branch, Put up a flag his men might see; But little did his false foe ken He meant them any injurie. 29 He set his horn to his mouth, And he has blawn baith loud and shrill; And then three thousand armed men Came tripping all out-oer the hill. 30 ‘Deliver us our chief!’ they all did cry, ‘It's by our hand that ye must die!’ ‘Here is your chief,’ the Turk replied, With that fell on his bended knee. 31 ‘O mercy, mercy, good fellows all, Mercy I pray you'll grant to me!’ ‘Such mercy as ye meant to give, Such mercy we shall give to thee.’ 32 This Turk they in his castle burnt, That stood upon yon hill so hie; John Thomson's gay lady they took, And hangd her on yon greenwood tree. JOHN THOMSON AND THE TURK—B Leyden's Glossary to The Complaynt of Scotland, p. 371. 1 O cam ye in by the House o Rodes, Or cam ye there away? Or have [ye] seen Johne Tamson? They say his wife has run away. 2 ‘O what wad ye do, Johne Tamson, Gin ye had me as I hae thee?’ ‘I wad tak ye to the gude green-wood, And gar your ain hand weil the tree.’ 3 Johne Tamson peeped and poorly spake Untill he did his ain men see; ‘O by my sooth,’ quo Johne Tamson, ‘Methinks I see a coming tree.’ 4 And they hae hanged that grim Soudan, For a' his mirth and meikle pride, And sae hae they that ill woman, Upon a scrogg-bush him beside. 267 THE HEIR OF LINNE The Heir of Lin THE HEIR OF LINNE—A Percy MS., p. 71; Hales and Furnivall, I, 174. 1 Off all the lords in faire Scottland A song I will begin; Amongst them all there dweld a lord Which was the vnthrifty lord of Linne. 2 His father and mother were dead him froe, And soe was the head of all his kinne; To the cards and dice that he did run He did neither cease nor bl[i]nne. 3 To drinke the wine that was soe cleere, With euery man he wold make merry; And then bespake him Iohn of the Scales, Vnto the heire of Linne sayd hee. 4 Sayes, How dost thou, Lord of Linne? Doest either want gold or fee? Wilt thou not sell thy lands soe brode To such a good fellow as me? 5 ‘Ffor I ’ he said, ‘My land, take it vnto thee;’ ‘I draw you to record, my lord[ë]s all;’ With that he cast him a god's peny. 6 He told him the gold vpon the bord, It wanted neuer a bare penny: ‘That gold is thine, the land is mine, The heire of Linne I wilbee.’ 7 ‘Heere's gold inoughe,’ saithe the heire of Linne, ‘Both for me and my company:’ He drunke the wine that was soe cleere, And with euery man he made merry. 8 With-in three quarters of a yeere His gold and fee it waxed thinne, His merry men were from him gone, And left him himselfe all alone. 9 He had neuer a penny left in his pursse, Neuer a penny [left] but three, And one was brasse, and another was lead, And another was white mony. 10 ‘Now well-aday!’ said the heire of Linne, ‘Now welladay, and woe is mee! For when I was the lord of Linne, I neither wanted gold nor fee. 11 ‘For I haue sold my lands soe broad, And haue not left me one penny; I must goe now and take some read Vnto Edenborrow, and begg my bread.’ 12 He had not beene in Edenborrow Not three qwarters of a yeere, But some did giue him, and some said nay, And some bid ‘to the deele gang yee! 13 ‘For if we shold hang any landles feer, The first we wold begin with thee.’ ‘Now welladay!’ said the heire of Linne, ‘No[w] welladay, and woe is mee! 14 ‘For now I have sold my lands soe broad, That mery man is irke with mee; But when that I was the lord of Linne, Then on my land I liued merrily. 15 ‘And now I have sold my land soe broade That I haue not left me one pennye! God be with my father!’ he said, ‘On his land he liued merrily.’ 16 Still in a study there as he stood, He vnbethought him of [a] bill; He vnbethought him of [a] bill Which his father had left with him. 17 Bade him he shold neuer on it looke Till he was in extreame neede, ‘And by my faith,’ said the heire of Linne, ‘Then now I had neuer more neede.’ 18 He tooke the bill, and looked it on, Good comfort that he found there; Itt told him of a castle wall Where there stood three chests in feare. 19 Two were full of the beaten gold, The third was full of white mony; He turned then downe his baggs of bread, And filled them full of gold soe red. 20 Then he did neuer cease nor blinne Till Iohn of the Scales house he did winne. When that he came to Iohn of the Scales, Vpp at the speere he looked then. 21 There sate three lords vpon a rowe, And Iohn o the Scales sate at the bord's head, And Iohn o the Scales sate at the bord's head, Because he was the lord of Linne. 22 And then bespake the heire of Linne, To Iohn o the Scales' wiffe thus sayd hee: Sayd, Dame, wilt thou not trust me one shott That I may sitt downe in this company? 23 ‘Now, Christ's curse on my head,’ shee said, ‘If I doe trust thee one pennye;’ Then be-spake a good fellowe, Which sate by Iohn o the Scales his knee. 24 Said, Haue thou here, thou heire of Linne, Forty pence I will lend thee; Some time a good fellow thou hast beene; And other forty if neede bee. 25 Thé dru[n]ken wine that was soe cleere, And euery man thé made merry; And then bespake him Iohn o the Scales, Vnto the lord of Linne said hee. 26 Said, How doest thou, heire of Linne, Since I did buy thy lands of thee? I will sell it to thee twenty pound better cheepe Nor euer I did buy it of thee. 27 ‘I draw you to recorde, lord[ë]s all,’ With that he cast him [a] god's penny; Then he tooke to his baggs of bread, And they were full of the gold soe redd. 28 He told him the gold then over the borde, It wanted neuer a broad pennye: ‘That gold is thine, the land is mine, And the heire of Linne againe I wilbee.’ 29 ‘Now welladay!’ said Iohn o the Scales' wife, ‘Welladay, and woe is me! Yesterday I was the lady of Linne, And now I am but Iohn o the Scales' wiffe!’ 30 Saies, Haue thou heere, thou good fellow, Forty pence thou did lend me, Forty pence thou did lend me, And forty pound I will giue thee. 31 ‘Ile make thee keeper of my forrest Both of the wild deere and the tame,’ 32 But then bespake the heire of Linne, These were the words, and thus said hee, Christs curse light vpon my crowne If ere my land stand in any ieopardye! The Heir of Linne; or, The Weary Heir of Linne; or, The Laird o Linne THE HEIR OF LINNE—B a. Buchan's MSS, I, 40. b. Buchan's MSS, II, 114. c. Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 112. 1 ‘The bonny heir, and the well-faird heir, And the weary heir o Linne, Yonder he stands at his father's yetts, And naebody bids him come in. 2 ‘O see for he gangs, an see for he stands, The weary heir o Linne! O see for he stands on the cauld casey, And nae an bids him come in! 3 ‘But if he had been his father's heir, Or yet the heir o Linne, He wadna stand on the cauld casey, Some an woud taen him in.’ 4 ‘Sing ower again that sang, nourice, The sang ye sung just now;’ ‘I never sung a sang in my life But I woud sing ower to you. 5 ‘O see for he gangs, an see for he stands, The weary heir o Linne! O see for he stands on the cauld casey, An nae an bids him come in! 6 ‘But if he had been his father's heir, Or yet the heir o Linne, He woudna stand on the cauld casye, Some an woud taen him in. 7 ‘When his father's lands a selling were, His claise lay well in fauld, But now he wanders on the shore, Baith hungry, weet, and cauld.’ 8 As Willie he gaed down the town, The gentlemen were drinking; Some bade gie Willie a glass, a glass, And some bade him gie nane, Some bade gie Willie a glass, a glass, The weary heir o Linne. 9 As Willie he came up the town, The fishers were a' sitting; Some bade gie Willie a fish, a fish, Some bade gie him a fin, Some bade gie him a fish, a fish, And lat the palmer gang. 10 He turned him right and round about, As will as a woman's son, And taen his cane into his hand, And on his way to Linne. 11 His nourice at her window lookd, Beholding dale and down, And she beheld this distressd young man Come walking to the town. 12 ‘Come here, come here, Willie,’ she said, ‘And rest yoursel wi me; I hae seen you in better days, And in jovial companie.’ 13 ‘Gie me a sheave o your bread, nourice, And a bottle o your wine, And I'll pay you it a' ower again, When I'm the laird o Linne.’ 14 ‘Ye'se get a sheave o my bread, Willie, And a bottle o my wine, But ye'll pay me when the seas gang dry, For ye'll neer be heir o Linne.’ 15 Then he turnd him right and round about, As will as woman's son, And aff he set, and bent his way, And straightway came to Linne. 16 But when he came to that castle, They were set down to dine; A score o nobles there he saw, Sat drinking at the wine. 17 Then some bade gie him beef, the beef, And some bade gie him the bane; And some bade gie him naething at a', But lat the palmer gang. 18 Then out it speaks the new-come laird, A saucy word spake hee; ‘Put round the cup, gie my rival a sup, Let him fare on his way.’ 19 Then out it speaks Sir Ned Magnew, Ane o young Willie's kin; ‘This youth was ance a sprightly boy As ever lived in Linne.’ 20 He turned him right and round about, As will as woman's son, Then minded him on a little wee key, That his mother left to him. 21 His mother left [him] this little wee key A little before she died; And bade him keep this little wee key Till he was in maist need. 22 Then forth he went, these nobles left, All drinkin' in the room, Wi walking rod intill his hand, He walked the castle roun. 23 There he found out a little door, For there the key slipped in, And there [he] got as muckle red gowd As freed the lands o Linne. 24 Back through the nobles then he went, A saucy man was then: ‘I'll take the cup frae this new-come laird, For he neer bade me sit down.’ 25 Then out it speaks the new-come laird, He spake wi mock an jeer; ‘I'd gie a seat to the laird o Linne, Sae be that he were here. 26 ‘When the lands o Linne a selling were, A' men said they were free; This lad shall hae them frae me this day, If he'll gie the third pennie.’ 27 ‘I take ye witness, nobles a', Guide witnesses ye'll be; I'm promisd the lands o Linne this day, If I gie the third pennie.’ 28 ‘Ye've taen us witness, Willie,’ they said, ‘Guide witnesses we'll be;’ ‘Buy the lands o Linne who likes, They'll neer be bought by thee.’ 29 He's done him to a gaming-table, For it stood fair and clean; There he tauld down as much rich gowd As freed the lands o Linne. 30 Thus having done, he turnd about, A saucy man was he; ‘Take up your monie, my lad,’ he says, ‘Take up your third pennie. 31 ‘Aft hae I gane wi barefeet cauld, Likewise wi legs full bare, An mony days walkd at these yetts Wi muckle dool and care. 32 ‘But now my sorrow's past and gane, And joy's returned to me, And here I've gowd enough forbye, Ahin this third pennie.’ 33 As Willie he gaed down the town, There he crawd wonderous crouse; He calld the may afore them a', The nourice o the house, 34 ‘Come here, come here, my nurse,’ he says, ‘I'll pay your bread and wine; Seas ebb and flow [as] they wont to do, Yet I'm the laird o Linne.’ 35 As he gaed up the Gallowgate port, His hose abeen his sheen; But lang ere he came down again Was convoyed by lords fifeteen. 268 THE TWA KNIGHTS THE TWA KNIGHTS Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 271. 1 There were twa knights in fair Scotland, And they were brothers sworn; They made a vow to be as true As if they'd been brothers born. 2 The one he was a wealthy knight, Had lands and buildings free; The other was a young hynde squire, In rank of lower degree. 3 But it fell ance upon a day These squires they walkd alone, And to each other they did talk About the fair women. 4 ‘O wed a may,’ the knight did say, ‘For your credit and fame; Lay never your love on lemanry, Bring nae gude woman to shame.’ 5 ‘There's nae gude women,’ the squire did say, ‘Into this place but nine;’ ‘O well falls me,’ the knight replied, ‘For ane o them is mine.’ 6 ‘Ye say your lady's a gude woman, But I say she is nane; I think that I could gain her love Ere six months they are gane. 7 ‘If ye will gang six months away, And sail upon the faem, Then I will gain your lady's love Before that ye come hame.’ 8 ‘O I'll gang till a far countrie, And far beyond the faem, And ye winna gain my lady's love Whan nine lang months are gane.’ 9 When the evening sun did set, And day came to an end, In then came the lady's gude lord, Just in at yon town's end. 10 ‘O comely are ye, my lady gay, Sae fair and rare to see; I wish whan I am gane away Ye keep your mind to me.’ 11 She gae'm a bason to wash in, It shin'd thro a' the ha; But aye as she gaed but and ben She loot the saut tears fa. 12 ‘I wonder what ails my gude lord He has sic jealousie; Never when we parted before, He spak sic words to me.’ 13 When cocks did craw, and day did daw, This knight was fair at sea; Then in it came the young hynde squire, To work him villanie. 14 ‘I hae a coffer o gude red gowd, Another o white monie; I woud gie you't a', my gay lady, To lye this night wi me.’ 15 ‘If ye warna my lord's brother, And him sae far frae hame, Even before my ain bower-door I'd gar hang you on a pin.’ 16 He's gane frae the lady's bower, Wi the saut tear in his ee, And he is to his foster-mother As fast as gang coud he. 17 ‘There is a fancy in my head That I'll reveal to thee, And your assistance I will crave If ye will grant it me. 18 ‘I've fifty gaineas in my pocket, I've fifty o them and three, And if ye'll grant what I request Ye'se hae them for your fee.’ 19 ‘Speak on, speak on, ye gude hynde squire, What may your asking be? I kenna wha woud be sae base As nae serve for sic a fee.’ 20 ‘O I hae wagerd wi my brother, When he went to the faem, That I woud gain his lady's love Ere six months they were gane. 21 ‘To me he laid his lands at stake Tho he were on the faem, I wudna gain his lady's love Whan nine lang months were gane. 22 ‘Now I hae tried to gain her love, But finds it winna do; And here I'm come, as ye her know, To seek some help frae you. 23 ‘For I did lay my life at stake, Whan my brother went frae hame, That I woud gain his lady's love Whan he was on the faem.’ 24 But when the evening sun was set, And day came to an end, In it came that fause carline, Just in at yon town's end. 25 ‘O comely are ye, my gay lady, Your lord is on the faem; Yon unco squire will gain your love, Before that he come hame.’ 26 ‘Forbid it,’ said the lady fair, ‘That eer the like shoud be, That I woud wrang my ain gude lord, And him sae far at sea.’ 27 ‘O comely are ye, my gay lady, Stately is your fair bodie; Your lovely visage is far chang'd, That is best known to me. 28 ‘You're sair dune out for want o sleep Sin your lord went to sea; Unless that ye do cease your grief, It will your ruin be. 29 ‘You'll send your maids unto the hay, Your young men unto the corn; I'll gar ye sleep as soun a sleep As the night that ye were born.’ 30 She sent her maids to ted the hay, Her men to shear the corn, And she gard her sleep as soun a sleep As the night that she was born. 31 She rowd that lady in the silk, Laid her on holland sheets; Wi fine enchanting melodie, She lulld her fast asleep. 32 She lockd the yetts o that castle Wi thirty locks and three, Then went to meet the young hynde squire To him the keys gae she. 33 He's opend the locks o that castle, Were thirty and were three, And he's gane where that lady lay, And thus to her said he. 34 ‘O wake, O wake, ye gay lady, O wake and speak to me; I hae it fully in my power To come to bed to thee.’ 35 ‘For to defile my husband's bed, I woud think that a sin; As soon as this lang day is gane, Then I shall come to thine.’ 36 Then she has calld her niece Maisry, Says, An asking ye'll grant me, For to gang to yon unco squire And sleep this night for me. 37 ‘The gude red gowd shall be your hire, And siller's be your fee; Five hundred pounds o pennies round, Your tocher it shall be.’ 38 She turnd her right and round about, And thus to her did say; O there was never a time on earth So fain's I woud say nay. 39 But when the evening sun was set, And day drawn to an end, Then Lady Maisry she is gane, Fair out at yon town-end. 40 Then she is to yon hynde squire's yates, And tirled at the pin; Wha was sae busy as the hynde squire To lat that lady in! 41 He's taen her in his arms twa, He was a joyfu man; He neither bade her meat nor drink, But to the bed he ran. 42 When he had got his will o her, His will as he lang sought, Her ring but and her ring-finger Away frae her he brought. 43 With discontent straight home she went, And thus lamented she; Says, Wae be to yon young hynde squire! Sae ill as he's used me. 44 When the maids came frae the hay, The young men frae the corn, Ben it came that lady gay, Who thought lang for their return. 45 ‘Where hae ye been, my maidens a', Sae far awa frae me? My foster-mother and lord's brother Thought to hae beguiled me. 46 ‘Had not she been my foster-mother, I suckd at her breast-bane, Even before my ain bower-door, She in a gleed shoud burn. 47 ‘The squire he thought to gain my love, He's got but Lady Maisry; He's cutted her ring and her ring-finger, A love-token for to be. 48 ‘I'll tie my finger in the dark, Where nae ane shall me see; I hope to loose it in the light, Amang gude companie.’ 49 When night was gane, and birds did sing, And day began to peep, The hynde squire walkd alang the shore, His brother for to meet. 50 ‘Ye are welcome, welcome, landless lord, To my ha's and my bowers; Ye are welcome hame, ye landless lord, To my lady white like flowers.’ 51 ‘Ye say I am a landless lord, But I think I am nane, Without ye show some love-token Awa frae her ye've tane.’ 52 He drew the strings then o his purse, And they were a' bludie; The ring but and the ring-finger Sae soon as he lat him see. 53 ‘O wae be to you, fause hynde squire, Ane ill death mat ye dee! It was too sair a love-token To take frae my ladie. 54 ‘But ae asking of you, hynde squire, In your won bowers to dine;’ ‘With a' my heart, my brother dear, Tho ye had asked nine.’ 55 Then he is to his lady's father, And a sorrow man was he: ‘O judge, O judge, my father dear, This judgment pass for me. 56 ‘What is the thing that shoud be done Unto that gay lady Who woud gar her lord gae landless, And children bastards to be?’ 57 ‘She shoud be brunt upon a hill, Or hangd upon a tree, That woud gar her lord gang landless, And children bastards be.’ 58 ‘Your judgment is too rash, father; Your ain daughter is she That this day has made me landless; Your squire gaind it frae me. 59 ‘Yet nevertheless, my parents dear, Ae favour ye'll grant me, And gang alang to my lost ha's, And take your dine wi me.’ 60 He threw the charters ower the table, And kissd the yates o tree; Says, Fare ye well, my lady gay, Your face I'll never see. 61 Then his lady calld out to him, Come here, my lord, and dine; There's nae a smith in a' the land That can ae finger join. 62 ‘I tied my finger in the dark, Whan nae ane did me see; But now I'll loose it in the light, Amang gude companie. 63 ‘Even my niece, Lady Maisry, The same woman was she; The gude red gowd shall be her hire, And likeways white monie. 64 ‘Five hundred pounds o pennies round Her tocher then shall be, Because she did my wills obey, Beguild the squire for me.’ 65 Then they did call this young hynde squire To come right speedilie, Likeways they calld young Lady Maisry, To pay her down her fee. 66 Then they laid down to Lady Maisry The brand but and the ring; It was to stick him wi the brand, Or wed him wi the ring. 67 Thrice she minted to the brand, But she took up the ring; And a' the ladies who heard o it Said she was a wise woman. 269 LADY DIAMOND Lady Daisy LADY DIAMOND—A Aytoun's Ballads of Scotland, II, 173, 1859, from the recollection of a lady residing at Kirkaldy. 1 There was a king, and a very great king, And a king of meikle fame; He had not a child in the world but ane, Lady Daisy was her name. 2 He had a very bonnie kitchen-boy, And William was his name; He never lay out o Lady Daisy's bower, Till he brought her body to shame. 3 When een-birds sung, and een-bells rung, And a' men were boune to rest, The king went on to Lady Daisy's bower, Just like a wandering ghaist. 4 He has drawn the curtains round and round, And there he has sat him down; ‘To whom is this, Lady Daisy,’ he says, ‘That now you gae so round? 5 ‘Is it to a laird? or is it to a lord? Or a baron of high degree? Or is it William, my bonnie kitchen-boy? Tell now the truth to me.’ 6 ‘It's no to a laird, and it's no to a lord, Nor a baron of high degree; But it's to William, your bonnie kitchen-boy: What cause hae I to lee?’ 7 ‘O where is all my merry, merry men, That I pay meat and fee, That they will not take out this kitchen-boy, And kill him presentlie?’ 8 They hae taen out this bonnie kitchen-boy, And killd him on the plain; His hair was like the threads o gold, His een like crystal stane; His hair was like the threads o gold, His teeth like ivory bane. 9 They hae taen out this bonnie boy's heart, Put it in a cup o gold; ‘Take that to Lady Daisy,’ he said, ‘For she's impudent and bold;’ And she washd it with the tears that ran from her eye Into the cup of gold. 10 ‘Now fare ye weel, my father the king! You hae taen my earthly joy; Since he's died for me, I'll die for him, My bonnie kitchen-boy.’ 11 ‘O where is all my merry, merry men, That I pay meat and wage, That they could not withold my cruel hand, When I was mad with rage? 12 ‘I think nae wonder, Lady Daisy,’ he said, ‘That he brought your body to shame; For there never was man of woman born Sae fair as him that is slain.’ Lady Dayisie LADY DIAMOND—B From “The Old Lady's Collection,” formerly in the possession of Sir Walter Scott, No 41. 1 Ther was a king, an a worthy king, [An a king] of birth an fame; He had an only dear daughter, An Dayesie was her name. 2 Ther was a boy about the house, Bold Roben was his name; He would not stay out of Dayese's bour, Till he brought her body [to] shame. 3 When bells was rung, An a' man bon to rest, The king went up to Lady Dayese's bour, He was an unwelcome gast. 4 ‘O Lady Dayesë, dear, d[ea]r Dayisie, What gars ye gae sae round?

LADY DIAMOND—C Sharpe's Ballad Book, No 4, p. 12, as sung by Mary Johnston, dairy maid at Hoddam Castle. 1 There was a king, and a glorious king, And a king of mickle fame, And he had daughters only one, Lady Dysmal was her name. 2 He had a boy, and a kitchen-boy, A boy of mickle scorn, And she lovd him lang, and she loved him aye, Till the grass oergrew the corn. 3 When twenty weeks were gone and past, O she began to greet! Her petticoat grew short before, And her stays they wadna meet. 4 It fell upon a winter's night The king could get nae rest; He came unto his daughter dear, Just like a wandring ghaist. 5 He cam into her bed-chalmer, And drew the curtains round: ‘What aileth thee, my daughter dear? I fear you've gotten wrong.’ 6 ‘O if I have, despise me not, For he is all my joy; I will forsake baith dukes and earls, And marry your kitchen-boy.’ 7 ‘Go call to me my merry men all, By thirty and by three; Go call to me my kitchen-boy, We'll murder him secretlie.’ 8 There was nae din that could be heard, And neer a word was said, Till they got him baith fast and sure Between twa feather-beds. 9 ‘Go cut the heart out of his breast, And put it in a cup of gold, And present it to his Dysmal dear, For she is baith stout and bold.’ 10 They've cut the heart out of his breast, And put it in a cup of gold, And presented it to his Dysmal dear, Who was baith stout and bold. 11 ‘O come to me, my hinney, my heart, O come to me, my joy! O come to me, my hinney, my heart My father's kitchen-boy!’ 12 She's taen the cup out of their hands, And set it at her bed-head; She washd it wi the tears that fell from her eyes, And next morning she was dead. 13 ‘O where were ye, my merry men all, Whom I paid meat and wage, Ye didna hold my cruel hand When I was in my rage? 14 ‘For gone is a' my heart's delight, And gone is a' my joy; For my dear Dysmal she is dead, And so is my kitchen-boy.’ Lady Diamond; or, Lady Diamond, the King's Daughter; or, Lady Diamond LADY DIAMOND—D Buchan's MSS, II, 164. 1 There was a king, and a curious king, And a king of royal fame, He had ae daughter, he had never mair, Lady Diamond was her name. 2 She's fa'en into shame, and lost her good name, And wrought her parents 'noy; And a' for her layen her love so low, On her father's kitchen-boy. 3 One night as she lay on her bed, Just thinking to get rest, Up it came her old father, Just like a wandering ghaist. 4 ‘Rise up, rise up, Lady Diamond,’ he says, ‘Rise up, put on your gown; Rise up, rise up, Lady Diamond,’ he says, ‘For I fear ye go too roun.’ 5 ‘Too roun I go, ye blame me no, Ye cause me not to shame; For better love I that bonny boy Than all your well-bred men.’ 6 The king's calld up his wall-wight men, That he paid meat and fee: ‘Bring here to me that bonny boy, And we'll smore him right quietlie.’ 7 Up hae they taken that bonny boy, Put him between twa feather-beds; Naething was dane, naething was said, Till that bonny boy was dead. 8 The king's taen out a broad, broad sword, And streakd it on a strow, And thro and thro that bonny boy's heart He's gart cauld iron go. 9 Out he has taen his poor bloody heart, Set it on a tasse of gold, And set it before Lady Diamond's face, Said, Fair lady, behold! 10 Up she has taen this poor bloody heart, And holden it in her hand: ‘Better loved I that bonny, bonny boy Than all my father's land.’ 11 Up she has taen his poor bloody heart And laid it at her head; The tears away frae her eyes did fly, And ere midnight she was dead. Robin, the Kitchie-Boy LADY DIAMOND—E Joseph Robertson, “Adversaria,” p. 66; noted down from a female servant, July 15, 1829. 1 It was a king, and a verra greit king, An a king o muckle fame, An he had a luvelie dauchter fair, An Dysie was her name. 2 She fell in love wi the kitchie-boy, An a verra bonnie boy was he, An word has gane till her father dear, An an angry man was he. 3 ‘Is it the laird? or is it the lord? Or a man o high degree? Or is it to Robin, the kitchie-boy? O Dysie mak nae lee.’ 4 ‘It's nae the laird, nor is it the lord, Nor a man o high degree, But it's to Robin, the kitchie-boy; What occasion hae I to lee?’ 5 ‘If it be to Robin, the kitchie-boy, As I trust weel it be, The morn, afore ye eat meal or drink, Ye'll see him hanged hie.’ 6 They have taen Robin out, His hair was like threads o gold; That verra day afore it was night, Death made young Dysie cold. 270 THE EARL OF MAR'S DAUGHTER The Earl of Mar's Daughter Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 49; Motherwell's MS. p. 565. 1 It was intill a pleasant time, Upon a simmer's day, The noble Earl of Mar's daughter Went forth to sport and play. 2 As thus she did amuse hersell, Below a green aik tree, There she saw a sprightly doo Set on a tower sae hie. 3 ‘O Cow-me-doo, my love sae true, If ye'll come down to me, Ye'se hae a cage o guid red gowd Instead o simple tree: 4 ‘I'll put gowd hingers roun your cage, And siller roun your wa; I'll gar ye shine as fair a bird As ony o them a'.’ 5 But she hadnae these words well spoke, Nor yet these words well said, Till Cow-me-doo flew frae the tower And lighted on her head. 6 Then she has brought this pretty bird Hame to her bowers and ha, And made him shine as fair a bird As ony o them a'. 7 When day was gane, and night was come, About the evening tide, This lady spied a sprightly youth Stand straight up by her side. 8 ‘From whence came ye, young man?’ she said; ‘That does surprise me sair; My door was bolted right secure, What way hae ye come here?’ 9 ‘O had your tongue, ye lady fair, Lat a' your folly be; Mind ye not on your turtle-doo Last day ye brought wi thee?’ 10 ‘O tell me mair, young man,’ she said, ‘This does surprise me now; What country hae ye come frae? What pedigree are you?’ 11 ‘My mither lives on foreign isles, She has nae mair but me; She is a queen o wealth and state, And birth and high degree. 12 ‘Likewise well skilld in magic spells, As ye may plainly see, And she transformd me to yon shape, To charm such maids as thee. 13 ‘I am a doo the live-lang day, A sprightly youth at night; This aye gars me appear mair fair In a fair maiden's sight. 14 ‘And it was but this verra day That I came ower the sea; Your lovely face did me enchant; I'll live and dee wi thee.’ 15 ‘O Cow-me-doo, my luve sae true, Nae mair frae me ye'se gae;’ ‘That's never my intent, my luve, As ye said, it shall be sae.’ 16 ‘O Cow-me-doo, my luve sae true, It's time to gae to bed;’ ‘Wi a' my heart, my dear marrow, It's be as ye hae said.’ 17 Then he has staid in bower wi her For sax lang years and ane, Till sax young sons to him she bare, And the seventh she's brought hame. 18 But aye as ever a child was born He carried them away, And brought them to his mither's care, As fast as he coud fly. 19 Thus he has staid in bower wi her For twenty years and three; There came a lord o high renown To court this fair ladie. 20 But still his proffer she refused, And a' his presents too; Says, I'm content to live alane Wi my bird, Cow-me-doo. 21 Her father sware a solemn oath Amang the nobles all, ‘The morn, or ere I eat or drink, This bird I will gar kill.’ 22 The bird was sitting in his cage, And heard what they did say; And when he found they were dismist, Says, Wae's me for this day! 23 ‘Before that I do langer stay, And thus to be forlorn, I'll gang unto my mither's bower, Where I was bred and born.’ 24 Then Cow-me-doo took flight and flew Beyond the raging sea, And lighted near his mither's castle, On a tower o gowd sae hie. 25 As his mither was wauking out, To see what she coud see, And there she saw her little son, Set on the tower sae hie. 26 ‘Get dancers here to dance,’ she said, ‘And minstrells for to play; For here's my young son, Florentine, Come here wi me to stay.’ 27 ‘Get nae dancers to dance, mither, Nor minstrells for to play, For the mither o my seven sons, The morn's her wedding-day.’ 28 ‘O tell me, tell me, Florentine, Tell me, and tell me true, Tell me this day without a flaw, What I will do for you.’ 29 ‘Instead of dancers to dance, mither, Or minstrells for to play, Turn four-and-twenty wall-wight men Like storks in feathers gray; 30 ‘My seven sons in seven swans, Aboon their heads to flee; And I mysell a gay gos-hawk, A bird o high degree.’ 31 Then sichin said the queen hersell, ‘That thing's too high for me;’ But she applied to an auld woman, Who had mair skill than she. 32 Instead o dancers to dance a dance, Or minstrells for to play, Four-and-twenty wall-wight men Turnd birds o feathers gray; 33 Her seven sons in seven swans, Aboon their heads to flee; And he himsell a gay gos-hawk, A bird o high degree. 34 This flock o birds took flight and flew Beyond the raging sea, And landed near the Earl Mar's castle, Took shelter in every tree. 35 They were a flock o pretty birds, Right comely to be seen; The people viewd them wi surprise, As they dancd on the green. 36 These birds ascended frae the tree And lighted on the ha, And at the last wi force did flee Amang the nobles a'. 37 The storks there seized some o the men, They coud neither fight nor flee; The swans they bound the bride's best man Below a green aik tree. 38 They lighted next on maidens fair, Then on the bride's own head, And wi the twinkling o an ee The bride and them were fled. 39 There's ancient men at weddings been For sixty years or more, But sic a curious wedding-day They never saw before. 40 For naething coud the companie do, Nor naething coud they say But they saw a flock o pretty birds That took their bride away. 41 When that Earl Mar he came to know Where his dochter did stay, He signd a bond o unity, And visits now they pay. 271 THE LORD OF LORN AND THE FALSE STEWARD Lord of Learne THE LORD OF LORN AND THE FALSE STEWARD—A Percy MS., p. 73, Hales and Furnivall, I, 180. 1 It was the worthy Lord of Learen, He was a lord of a hie degree; He had noe more children but one sonne, He sett him to schoole to learne curtesie. 2 Lear[n]ing did soe proceed with that child, I tell you all in veretie, He learned more vpon one day Then other children did on three, 3 And then bespake the schoole-master, Vnto the Lord of Learne said hee, I thinke thou be some stranger borne, For the holy gost remaines with thee. 4 He said, I am noe stranger borne, Forsooth, master, I tell it to thee; It is a gift of Almighty God Which he hath giuen vnto mee. 5 The schoole-master turnd him round about, His angry mind he thought to asswage, For the child cold answer him soe quicklie, And was of soe tender yeere of age. 6 The child he caused a steed to be brought, A golden bridle done him vpon; He tooke his leaue of his schoolfellows, And home the child that he is gone. 7 And when he came before his father, He ffell low downe vpon his knee: ‘My blessing, father, I wold aske, If Christ wold grant you wold gine it me.’ 8 ‘Now God thee blesse, my sonne and my heire, His servant in heauen that thou may bee! What tydings hast thou brought me, child, Thou art comen home so soone to mee?’ 9 ‘Good tydings, father, I haue you brought, Goo[d tydings] I hope it is to thee; The booke is not in all S[c]ottlande But I can reade it before your eye.’ 10 A ioyed man his father was, Euen the worthy Lord of Learne: ‘Thou shalt goe into Ffrance, my child, The speeches of all strange lands to learne.’ 11 But then bespake the child his mother, The Lady of Learne and then was shee; Saies, Who must be his well good guide, When he goes into that strange country? 12 And then bespake that bonnie child, Vntill his father tenderlie; Saies, Father, I'le haue the hend steward, For he hath beene true to you and mee. 13 The lady to concell the steward did take, And counted downe a hundred pound there; Saies, Steward, be true to my sonne and my heire, And I will giue thee mickle mere. 14 ‘If I be not true to my master,’ he said, ‘Christ himselfe be not trew to mee! If I be not true to my lord and master, An ill death that I may die!’ 15 The Lord of Learne did apparell his child With bruche, and ringe, and many a thinge; The apparrell he had his body vppon, Thé say was worth a squier's liuinge. 16 The parting of the younge Lord of Learne With his ffather, his mother, his ffellows deere, Wold haue made a manis hart for to change, If a Iew borne that he were. 17 The wind did serue, and thé did sayle Over the sea into Ffrance land; He vsed the child soe hardlie, He wold let him haue neuer a penny to spend. 18 And meate he wold let the child haue none, Nor mony to buy none, trulie; The boy was hungry and thirsty both; Alas! it was the more pitty. 19 He laid him downe to drinke the water That was soe low beneathe the brime; He [that] was wont to haue drunke both ale and wine Then was faine of the water soe thinne. 20 And as he was drinking of the water That ran soe low beneath the brime, Soe ready was the false steward To drowne the bonny boy therin. 21 ‘Haue mercy on me, worthy steward! My life,’ he said, ‘lend it to mee, And all that I am heire vpon,’ Saies, ‘I will giue vnto thee.’ 22 Mercy to him the steward did take, And pulld the child out of the brime; Euer alacke, the more pittye! He tooke his clothes euen from him. 23 Saies, Doe thou me of that veluett gowne, The crimson hose beneath thy knee, And doe me of thy cordiuant shoone, Are buckled with the gold soe free. 24 ‘Doe thou me off thy sattin doublett, Thy shirtband wrought with glistering gold, And doe mee off thy golden chaine, About thy necke soe many a fold. 25 ‘Doe thou me off thy veluett hat, With fether in that is soe ffine; All vnto thy silken shirt, That's wrought with many a golden seam.’ 26 The child before him naked stood, With skin as white as lilly flower; For [t]his worthy lords bewtie He might haue beene a ladye's paramoure. 27 He put vpon him a lether cote, And breeches of the same beneath the knee, And sent that bony child him froe, Service for to craue, truly. 28 He pulld then forth a naked sword That hange full low then by his side; ‘Turne thy name, thou villaine,’ he said, ‘Or else this sword shall be thy guide.’ 29 ‘What must be my name, worthy steward? I pray thee now tell it me:’ ‘Thy name shalbe Pore Disaware, To tend sheepe on a lonelye lee.’ 30 The bonny child he went him froe, And looked to himselfe, truly; Saw his apparrell soe simple vppon; O Lord! he weeped tenderlye. 31 Vnto a shepard's house that childe did goe, And said, Sir, God you saue and see! Doe you not want a servant-boy, To tend your sheepe on a lonelie lee? 32 ‘Where was thou borne?’ the shepard said, ‘Where, my boy, or in what country?’ ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I was borne in fayre Scottland, That is soe farr beyond the sea.’ 33 ‘I haue noe child,’ the shepard sayd; ‘My boy, thoust tarry and dwell with mee; My liuinge,’ he sayd, ‘and all my goods, I'le make thee heire [of] after mee.’ 34 And then bespake the shepard's wife, To the Lord of Learne thus did she say; ‘Goe thy way to our sheepe,’ she said, ‘And tend them well both night and day.’ 35 It was a sore office, O Lord, for him That was a lord borne of a great degree! As he was tending his sheepe alone, Neither sport nor play cold hee. 36 Let vs leaue talking of the Lord of Learne, And let all such talking goe; Let vs talke more of the false steward, That caused the child all this woe. 37 He sold this Lord of Learne's his clothes For fiue hundred pound to his pay [there], And bought himselfe a suite of apparrell Might well beseeme a lord to weare. 38 When he that gorgeous apparrell bought, That did soe finelie his body vppon, He laughed the bony child to scorne That was the bonny Lord of Learne. 39 He laughed that bonny boy to scorne; Lord! pitty it was to heare; I haue herd them say, and soe haue you too, That a man may buy gold to deere. 40 When that he had all that gorgeous apparrell, That did soe finelie his body vpon, He went a woing to the Duke's daughter of France, And called himselfe the Lord of Learne. 41 The Duke of Ffrance heard tell of this, To his place that worthy lord was come, truly; He entertaind him with a quart of red Renish wi[ne], Saies, Lord of Learne, thou art welcome to me. 42 Then to supper that they were sett, Lords and ladyes in their degree; The steward was sett next the Duke of France; An vnseemlye sight it was to see. 43 Then bespake the Duke of Ffrance, Vnto the Lord of Leearne said hee there, Sayes, Lord of Learne, if thou'le marry my daught[er], I'le mend thy liuing fiue hundred pound a yeere. 44 Then bespake that lady fayre, Answered her ffather soe alone, That shee would be his marryed wiffe If he wold make her lady of Learne. 45 Then hand in hand the steward her he tooke, And plight that lady his troth alone, That she shold be his marryed wiffe, And he wold make her the ladie of Learne. 46 Thus that night it was gone, The other day was come, truly; The lady wold see the robucke run, Vp hills and dales and forrest free. 47 Then shee was ware of the younge Lord of Learne Tending sheepe vnder a bryar, trulye. 48 And thus shee called vnto her maids, And held her hands vp thus an hie; Sayes, Feitch me yond shepard's boy, I'le know why he doth mourne, trulye. 49 When he came before that lady fayer, He fell downe vpon his knee; He had beene so well brought vpp He needed not to learne curtesie. 50 ‘Where wast thou borne, thou bonny boy? Where or in what countrye?’ ‘Madam, I was borne in faire Scottland, That is soe farr beyond the sea.’ 51 ‘What is thy name, thou bonny boy? I pray thee tell it vnto mee;’ ‘My name,’ he sayes, ‘is Poore Disaware, That tends sheepe on a lonely lee.’ 52 ‘One thing thou must tell mee, bonny boy, Which I must needs aske of thee, Dost not thou know the young Lord of Learne? He is comen a woing into France to me.’ 53 ‘Yes, that I doe, madam,’ he said, And then he wept most tenderlie; ‘The Lord of Learne is a worthy lord, If he were at home in his oune country.’ 54 ‘What ayles thee to weepe, my bonny boy? Tell me or ere I part thee froe:’ ‘Nothing but for a freind, madam, That's dead from me many a yeere agoe.’ 55 A loud laughter the ladie lought, O Lord! shee smiled wonderous hie: ‘I haue dwelled in France since I was borne; Such a shepard's boy I did neuer see. 56 ‘Wilt thou not leaue thy sheepe, my child, And come vnto service vnto mee? And I will giue thee meate and fee, And my chamberlaine thou shalt bee.’ 57 ‘Then I will leaue my sheepe, madam,’ he sayd, ‘And come into service vnto thee, If you will giue me meate and fee, Your chamberlaine that I may bee.’ 58 When the lady came before her father, Shee fell low downe vpon her knee; ‘Grant me, father,’ the lady said, ‘This boy my chamberlaine to be.’ 59 ‘But O nay, nay,’ the duke did say, ‘Soe my daughter it may not bee; The lord that is come a woing to you Will be offended with you and mee.’ 60 Then came downe the false steward, Which called himselfe the Lord of Learne, trulie; When he looked that bonny boy vpon, An angry man i-wis was hee. 61 ‘Where was thou borne, thou vagabond? Where?’ he sayd, ‘and in what country?’ Says, I was borne in fayre Scotland, That is soe far beyond the sea. 62 ‘What is thy name, thou vagabond? Haue done qu[i]cklie, and tell it to me;’ ‘My name,’ he sayes, ‘is Poore Disaware, I tend sheep on the lonelie lee.’ 63 ‘Thou art a theefe,’ the steward said, ‘And soe in the end I will prooue thee;’ 64 Then be-spake the ladie fayre, ‘Peace, Lord of Learne! I doe pray thee; Ffor if noe loue you show this child, Noe favor can you haue of mee.’ 65 ‘Will you beleeue me, lady faire, When the truth I doe tell yee? Att Aberdonie, beyond the sea, His father he robbed a hundred three.’ 66 But then bespake the Duke of France Vnto the boy soe tenderlie; Saies, Boy, if thou loue harsses well, My stable-groome I will make thee. 67 And thus that that did passe vppon Till the twelve monthes did draw to an ende; The boy applyed his office soe well Euery man became his freind. 68 He went forth earlye one morning To water a gelding at the water soe free; The gelding vp, and with his head He hitt the child aboue his eye. 69 ‘Woe be to thee, thou gelding,’ he sayd, ‘And to the mare that foled thee! Thou hast striken the Lord of Learne A litle tinye aboue the eye. 70 ‘First night after I was borne, a lord I was, An earle after my father doth die; My father is the worthy Lord of Learne, And child he hath noe more but mee; He sent me over the sea with the false steward, And thus that he hath beguiled mee.’ 71 The lady [wa]s in her garden greene, Walking with her mayds, trulye, And heard the boy this mourning make, And went to weeping, trulie. 72 ‘Sing on thy song, thou stable groome, I pray thee doe not let for mee, And as I am a true ladie I wilbe trew vnto thee.’ 73 ‘But nay, now nay, madam!’ he sayd, ‘Soe that it may not bee; I am tane sworne vpon a booke, And forsworne I will not bee.’ 74 ‘Sing on thy song to thy gelding, And thou doest not sing to mee; And as I am a true ladie I will euer be true vnto thee.’ 75 He sayd, Woe be to thee, gelding, And to the mare that foled thee! For thou hast strucken the Lord of Learne A litle aboue mine eye. 76 First night I was borne, a lord I was, An earle after my father doth dye; My father is the good Lord of Learne, And child he hath noe other but mee; My father sent me over [the sea] with the false steward, And thus that he hath beguiled mee. 77 ‘Woe be to the steward, lady,’ he sayd, ‘Woe be to him verrily! He hath beene about this twelve months day For to deceiue both thee and mee. 78 ‘If you doe not my councell keepe, That I haue told you with good intent, And if you doe it not well keepe, Ffarwell! my life is at an ende.’ 79 ‘I wilbe true to thee, Lord of Learne, Or else Christ be not soe vnto me; And as I am a trew ladye, I'le neuer marry none but thee.’ 80 Shee sent in for her father, the Duke, In all the speed that ere might bee; ‘Put of my wedding, father,’ shee said, ‘For the loue of God, this monthës three. 81 ‘Sicke I am,’ the ladye said, ‘O sicke, and verry like to die! Put of my wedding, father Duke, Ffor the loue of God, this monthës three.’ 82 The Duke of France put of this wedding Of the steward and the lady monthës three, For the ladie sicke shee was, Sicke, sicke, and like to die. 83 Shee wrote a letter with her owne hand, In all the speede that euer might bee; Shee sent [it] over into Scottland, That is soe ffarr beyond the sea. 84 When the messenger came beffore the old Lord of Learne, He kneeled low downe on his knee, And he deliuered the letter vnto him, In all the speed that euer might bee. 85 [The] first looke he looked the letter vpon, Lo! he wept full bitterly; The second looke he looked it vpon, Said, False steward, woe be to thee! 86 When the Ladye of Learne these tydings heard, O Lord! shee wept soe biterlye: ‘I told you of this, now good my lord, When I sent my child into that wild country.’ 87 ‘Peace, Lady of Learne,’ the lord did say, ‘For Christ his loue I doe pray thee; And as I am a christian man, Wroken vpon him that I wilbe.’ 88 He wrote a letter with his owne hand, In all the speede that ere might bee; He sent it into the lords in Scottland, That were borne of a great degree. 89 He sent for lords, he sent for knights, The best that were in the countrye, To go with him into the land of France, To seeke his sonne in that strange country. 90 The wind was good, and they did sayle, Fiue hundred men into France land, There to seeke that bonny boy That was the worthy Lord of Learne. 91 They sought the country through and through, Soe farr to the Duke's place of Ffrance land; There they were ware of that bonny boy, Standing with a porter's staffe in his hand. 92 Then the worshippfull, thé did bowe, The serving-men fell on their knee, They cast their hatts vp into the ayre For ioy that boy that they had seene. 93 The Lord of Learne then he light downe, And kist his child both cheeke and chinne, And said, God blesse thee, my sonne and my heire! The blisse of heauen that thou may winne! 94 The false steward and the Duke of France Were in a castle-topp, trulie; ‘What fooles are yond,’ says the false steward, ‘To the porter makes soe lowe curtesie?’ 95 Then bespake the Duke of Ffrance, Calling my Lord of Learne, trulie; He sayd, I doubt the day be come That either you or I must die. 96 Thé sett the castle round about, A swallow cold not haue flone away; And there thé tooke the false steward That the Lord of Learne did betray. 97 And when they had taken the false steward, He fell lowe downe vpon his knee, And craued mercy of the Lord of Learne For the villanous dedd he had done, trulye. 98 ‘Thou shalt haue mercy,’ said the Lord of Learne, ‘Thou vile traitor, I tell to thee, As the lawes of the realme they will thee beare, Wether it bee for thee to liue or dye.’ 99 A quest of lords that there was chosen, To goe vppon his death, trulie; There thé iudged the false steward, Whether he was guiltie, and for to dye. 100 The forman of the iury he came in, He spake his words full lowd and hie; Said, Make thee ready, thou false steward, For now thy death it drawes full nie. 101 Sayd he, If my death it doth draw nie, God forgiue me all I haue done amisse! Where is that lady I haue loued soe longe? Before my death to giue me a kisse. 102 ‘Away, thou traitor!’ the lady said, ‘Auoyd out of my company! For thy vild treason thou hast wrought, Thou had need to cry to God for mercye.’ 103 First they tooke him and h[a]ngd him halfe, And let him downe before he was dead, And quartered him in quarters many, And sodde him in a boyling lead. 104 And then they tooke him out againe, And cutten all his ioynts in sunder, And burnte him eke vpon a hyll; I-wis thé did him curstlye cumber. 105 A loud laughter the lady laught, O Lord! she smiled merrylie; She sayd, I may praise my heauenly king That euer I seene this vile traytor die. 106 Then bespake the Duke of France, Vnto the right Lord of Learne sayd he there; Says, Lord of Learne, if thou wilt marry my daught[er] I'le mend thy liuing fiue hundred a yeere. 107 But then bespake that bonie boy, And answered the Duke quicklie, I had rather marry your daughter with a ring of go[ld] Then all the gold that ere I blinket on with mine eye. 108 But then bespake the old Lord of Learne, To the Duke of France thus he did say, Seeing our children doe soe well agree, They shalbe marryed ere wee goe away. 109 The Lady of Learne shee was sent for Throughout Scottland soe speedilie, To see these two children sett vpp In their seats of gold full royallye. A pretty ballad of the Lord of Lorn and the Fals Steward THE LORD OF LORN AND THE FALSE STEWARD—B a. Wood, 401, fol. 95 b. b. Roxburghe, I, 222, III, 534; Roxburghe Ballads, ed. Chappell, II, 55. c. Pepys, I, 494, No 254 (from a transcript in Percy's papers). 1 It was a worthy Lord of Lorn, He was a lord of high degree, He sent [his son] unto the schoole, To learn some civility. 2 He learned more learning in one day Then other children did in three; And then bespake the schoolmaster Unto him tenderly. 3 ‘In faith thou art the honestest boy That ere I blinkt on with mine eye; I hope thou art some easterling born, The Holy Ghost is with thee.’ 4 He said he was no easterling born, The child thus answered courteously; My father is the Lord of Lorn, And I his son, perdye. 5 The schoolmaster turned round about, His angry mood he could not swage; He marvelled the child could speak so wise, He being of so tender age. 6 He girt the saddle to the steed, The bridle of the best gold shone; He took his leave of his fellows all, And quickly he was gone. 7 And when he came to his father dear He kneeled down upon his knee; ‘I am come to you, fathe[r],’ he said, ‘God's blessing give you me.’ 8 ‘Thou art welcome, son,’ he said, ‘God's blessing I give thee; What tidings hast thou brought, my son, Being come so hastily?’ 9 ‘I have brought tidings, father,’ he said, ‘And so likëd it may be, There's never a book in all Scotland But I can read it, truly. 10 ‘There's nere a doctor in all this realm, For all he goes in rich array, I can write him a lesson soon To learn in seven years day.’ 11 ‘That is good tidings,’ said the lord, ‘All in the place where I do stand; My son, thou shalt into France go, To learn the speeches of each land.’ 12 ‘Who shall go with him?’ said the lady; ‘Husband, we have no more but he;’ ‘Madam,’ he saith, ‘my head steward, He hath bin true to me.’ 13 She cal'd the steward to an account, A thousand pound she gave him anon; Sayes, Good Sir Steward, be as good to my child, When he is far from home. 14 ‘If I be fals unto my young lord, Then God be [the] like to me indeed!’ And now to France they both are gone, And God be their good speed. 15 They had not been in France land Not three weeks unto an end, But meat and drink the child got none, Nor mony in purse to spend. 16 The child ran to the river's side; He was fain to drink water then; And after followed the fals steward, To put the child therein. 17 ‘But nay, marry!’ said the child, He asked mercy pittifully, ‘Good steward, let me have my life, What ere betide my body.’ 18 ‘Now put off thy fair cloathing And give it me anon; So put thee of thy s'lken shirt, With many a golden seam.’ 19 But when the child was stript naked, His body white as the lilly-flower, He might have bin seen for his body A prince's paramour. 20 He put him in an old kelter coat And hose of the same above the knee, He bid him go to the shepherd's house, To keep sheep on a lonely lee. 21 The child did say, What shall be my name? Good steward, tell to me; ‘Thy name shall be Poor Disawear, That thy name shall be.’ 22 The child came to the shepheard's house And asked mercy pittifully; Sayes, Good sir shepheard, take me in, To keep sheep on a lonely lee. 23 But when the shepheard saw the child, He was so pleasant in his eye, ‘I have no child, I'le make thee my heir, Thou shalt have my goods, perdie.’ 24 And then bespake the shepheard's wife, Unto the child so tenderly; ‘Thou must take the sheep and go to the field, And keep them on a lonely lee.’ 25 Now let us leave talk of the child, That is keeping sheep on a lonely lee, And we'l talk more of the fals steward, And of his fals treachery. 26 He bought himself three suits of apparrell, That any lord might a seem[d] to worn, He went a wooing to the Duke's daughter, And cal'd himself the Lord of Lorn. 27 The duke he welcomed the yong lord With three baked stags anon; If he had wist him the fals steward, To the devill he would have gone. 28 But when they were at supper set, With dainty delicates that was there, The d[uke] said, If thou wilt wed my daughter, I'le give thee a thousand pound a year. 29 The lady would see the red buck run, And also for to hunt the doe, And with a hundred lusty men The lady did a hunting go. 30 The lady is a hunting gon, Over le and fell that is so high; There was she ware of a shepherd's boy, With sheep on a lonely lee. 31 And ever he sighed and made moan, And cried out pittifully, ‘My father is the Lord of Lorn, And knows not wha[t]'s become of me.’ 32 And then bespake the lady gay, And to her maid she spake anon, ‘Go fetch me hither the shepherd's boy; Why maketh he all this moan?’ 33 But when he came before the lady He was not to learn his courtesie: 34 ‘Where was thou born, thou bonny child? For whose sake makst thou all this mone?’ ‘My dearest friend, lady,’ he said, ‘Is dead many years agon.’ 35 ‘Tell thou to me, thou bonny child, Tell me the truth and do not lye, Knost thou not the yong lord of Lorn, Is come a wooing unto me?’ 36 ‘Yes, forsooth,’ then said the child, ‘I know the lord then, veryly; The young lord is a valliant lord At home in his own country.’ 37 ‘Wilt leave thy sheep, thou bonny child, And come in service unto me?’ ‘Yes, forsooth,’ then said the child, ‘At your bidding will I be.’ 38 When the steward lookt upon the child, He bewraild him villainously: ‘Where wast thou born, thou vagabone? Or where is thy country?’ 39 ‘Ha don! ha don!’ said the lady gay, She cal'd the steward then presently; ‘Without you bear him more good will, You get no love of me.’ 40 Then bespake the false steward Unto the lady hastily: ‘At Aberdine, beyond the seas, His father robbëd thousands three.’ 41 But then bespake the lady gay Unto her father courteously, Saying, I have found a bonny child My chamberlain to be. 42 ‘Not so, not so,’ then said the duke, ‘For so it may not be, For that young L[ord] of Lorn that comes a wooing Will think somthing of thee and me.’ 43 When the duke had lookt upon the child, He seemd so pleasant to the eye, ‘Child, because thou lovst horses well, My groom of stables thou shalt be.’ 44 The child plied the horses well A twelve month to an end; He was so courteous and so true Every man became his fri[e]nd. 45 He led a fair gelding to the water, Where he might drink, verily; The great gelding up with his head And hit the child above the eye. 46 ‘Wo worth thee, horse!’ then said the child, ‘That ere mare foalëd thee! Thou little knowst what thou hast done; Thou hast stricken a lord of high degree.’ 47 The d[uke's] daughter was in her garden green, She heard the child make great moan; She ran to the child all weeping, And left her maidens all alone. 48 ‘Sing on thy song, thou bonny child, I will release thee of thy pain;’ ‘I have made an oath, lady,’ he said, ‘I dare not tell my tale again.’ 49 ‘Tell the horse thy tale, thou bonny child, And so thy oath shall savëd be;’ But when he told the horse his tale The lady wept full tenderly. 50 ‘I'le do for thee, my bonny child, In faith I will do more for thee; For I will send thy father word, And he shall come and speak with me. 51 ‘I will do more, my bonny child, In faith I will do more for thee, And for thy sake, my bonny child, I'le put my wedding off months three.’ 52 The lady she did write a letter, Full pittifully with her own hand, She sent it to the Lord of Lorn Whereas he dwelt in fair Scotland. 53 But when the lord had read the letter His lady wept most tenderly: ‘I knew what would become of my child In such a far country.’ 54 The old lord cal'd up his merry men, And all that he gave cloth and fee, With seven lords by his side, And into France rides he. 55 The wind servd, and they did saile So far into France land; They were ware of the Lord of Lorn, With a porter's staff in his hand. 56 The lords they moved hat and hand, The servingmen fell on their knee; ‘What folks be yonder,’ said the steward, ‘That makes the porter courtesie?’ 57 ‘Thou art a false thief,’ said the L[ord] of Lorn, ‘No longer might I bear with thee; By the law of France thou shalt be ju[d]gd, Whether it be to live or die.’ 58 A quest of lords there chosen was, To bench they came hastily, But when the quest was ended The fals steward must dye. 59 First they did him half hang, And then they took him down anon, And then put him in boyling lead, And then was sodden, brest and bone. 60 And then bespake the Lord of Lorn, With many other lords mo; ‘Sir Duke, if you be as willing as we, We'l have a marriage before we go.’ 61 These children both they did rejoyce To hear the lord his tale so ended; They had rather to day then to morrow, So he would not be offended. 62 But when the wedding ended was There was delicious dainty cheer; I'le tell you how long the wedding did last, Full three quarters of a year. 63 Such a banquet there was wrought, The like was never seen; The king of France brought with him then A hundred tun of good red wine. 64 Five set of musitians were to be seen, That never rested night nor day, Also Italians there did sing, Full pleasantly with great joy. 65 Thus have you heard what troubles great Unto successive joyes did turn, And happy news among the rest Unto the worthy Lord of Lorn. 66 Let rebels therefore warnëd be How mischief once they do pretend; For God may suffer for a time, But will disclose it in the end. 272 THE SUFFOLK MIRACLE The Suffolk Miracle a. Wood, E. 25, fol. 83. b. Roxburghe, II, 240; Moore's Pictorial Book of Ancient Ballad Poetry, p. 463. 1 A wonder stranger ne'r was known Then what I now shall treat upon. In Suffolk there did lately dwell A farmer rich and known full well. 2 He had a daughter fair and bright, On whom he plac'd his chief delight; Her beauty was beyond compare, She was both virtuous and fair. 3 A young man there was living by, Who was so charmëd with her eye That he could never be at rest, He was with love so much possest. 4 He made address to her, and she Did grant him love immediately; Which when her father came to hear, He parted her and her poor dear. 5 Forty miles distant was she sent, Unto his brother's, with intent That she should there so long remain Till she had chang'd her mind again. 6 Hereat this young man sadly grievd, But knew not how to be relievd; He sighd and sobd continually That his true love he could not see. 7 She by no means could to him send Who was her heart's espousëd friend; He sighd, she grievd, but all in vain, For she confin'd must still remain. 8 He mournd so much that doctor's art Could give no ease unto his heart; Who was so strang[e]ly terrified, That in short time for love he dyed. 9 She that from him was sent away Knew nothing of his dying-day, But constant still she did remain; To love the dead was then in vain. 10 After he had in grave been laid A month or more, unto this maid He comes about middle of the night, Who joyd to see her heart's delight. 11 Her father's horse, which well she knew, Her mother's hood and safeguard too, He brought with him to testifie Her parents' order he came by. 12 Which when her unckle understood, He hop't it would be for her good, And gave consent to her straightway That with him she should come away. 13 When she was got her love behind, They passd as swift as any wind, That in two hours, or little more, He brought her to her father's door. 14 But as they did this great haste make, He did complain his head did ake; Her handkerchief she then took out, And tyed the same his head about. 15 And unto him she thus did say: ‘Thou art as cold as any clay; When we come home, a fire wee'l have;’ But little dreamt he went to grave. 16 Soon were they at her father's door, And after she ne'r see him more; ‘I'le set the horse up,’ then he said, And there he left this harmless maid. 17 She knockt, and strait a man he cryed, ‘Who's there?’ ‘'Tis I,’ she then replyed; Who wondred much her voice to hear, And was possest with dread and fear. 18 Her father he did tell, and then He stared like an affrighted man: Down stairs he ran, and when he see her, Cry'd out, My child, how cam'st thou here? 19 ‘Pray, sir, did you not send for me, By such a messenger?’ said she: Which made his hair stare on his head, As knowing well that he was dead. 20 ‘Where is he?’ then to her he said; ‘He's in the stable,’ quoth the maid. ‘Go in,’ said he, ‘and go to bed; I'le see the horse well littered.’ 21 He stared about, and there could hee No shape of any mankind see, But found his horse all on a sweat; Which made him in a deadly fret. 22 His daughter he said nothing to, Nor no one else, though well they knew That he was dead a month before, For fear of grieveing her full sore. 23 Her father to his father went Who was deceasd, with this intent, To tell him what his daughter said; So both came back unto this maid. 24 They askd her, and she still did say 'T was he that then brought her away; Which when they heard they were amaz'd, And on each other strang[e]ly gaz'd. 25 A handkerchief she said she tyed About his head, and that they tryed; The sexton they did speak unto, That he the grave would then undo. 26 Affrighted then they did behold His body turning into mould, And though he had a month been dead, This kercheif was about his head. 27 This thing unto her then they told, And the whole truth they did unfold; She was thereat so terrified And grievd, she quickly after dyed. 28 Part not true love, you rich men, then; But, if they be right honest men Your daughters love, give them their way, For force oft breeds their lives' decay. 273 KING EDWARD THE FOURTH AND A TANNER OF TAMWORTH KING EDWARD THE FOURTH AND A TANNER OF TAMWORTH a.

Roxburghe, I, 176, 177; Chappell, Roxburghe Ballads, I, 529. 1 In summer time, when leaves grew green, and birds were singing on every tree, King Edward would a hunting ride, some pastime for to see. 2 Our king he would a hunting ride, by eight a clock of the day, And well was he ware of a bold tanner, came riding on the way. 3 A good russet coat the tanner had on, fast buttoned under his chin, And under him a good cow-hide, and a mare of four shilling. 4 ‘Now stand you here, my good lords all, under this trusty tree, And I will wend to yonder fellow, to know from whence came he. 5 ‘God speed, God speed,’ then said our king; ‘thou art welcome, good fellow,’ quoth he; ‘Which is the way to Drayton Basset I pray thee shew to me.’ 6 ‘The ready way to Drayton Basset, from this place as thou dost stand, The next pair of gallows thou comst to thou must turn up [on] thy right hand.’ 7 ‘That is not the way,’ then said our king, ‘the ready way I pray thee shew me;’ ‘Whether thou be thief or true man,’ quoth the tanner, ‘I'm weary of thy company. 8 ‘Away, with a vengeance,’ quoth the tanner, ‘I hold thee out of thy wit, For all this day have I ridden and gone, And I am fasting yet.’ 9 ‘Go with me to Drayton Basset,’ said our king, ‘no daintyes we will lack; We'l have meat and drink of the best, And I will pay the shot.’ 10 ‘Godamercy for nothing,’ said the tanner, ‘thou shalt pay for no dinner of mine; I have more groats and nobles in my purse then thou hast pence in thine.’ 11 ‘God save your goods,’ then said the king, ‘and send them well to thee!’ ‘Be thou thief or true man,’ quoth the tanner, ‘I am weary of thy company. 12 ‘Away, with a vengeance,’ quoth the tanner, ‘of thee I stand in fear; The aparrell thou wearst on thy back May seem a good lord to wear.’ 13 ‘I never stole them,’ said our king, ‘I swear to thee by the rood;’ ‘Thou art some ruffian of the country, thou rid'st in the midst of thy good.’ 14 ‘What news dost thou hear?’ then said our king, ‘I pray what news do you hear?’ ‘I hear no news,’ answered the tanner, ‘but that cow-hides be dear.’ 15 ‘Cow-hides? cow-hides?’ then said our king, ‘I marvell what they be;’ ‘Why, art thou a fool?’ quoth the tanner, ‘look, I have one under me.’ 16 ‘Yet one thing now I would thee pray, so that thou wouldst not be strange; If thy mare be better then my steed, I pray thee let us change.’ 17 ‘But if you needs with me will change, As change full well may ye, By the faith of my body,’ quoth the tanner, ‘I look to have boot of thee.’ 18 ‘What boot wilt thou ask?’ then said our king, ‘what boot dost thou ask on this ground?’ ‘No pence nor half-pence,’ said the tanner, ‘but a noble in gold so round.’ 19 ‘Here's twenty good groats,’ then said the king, ‘so well paid see you be;’ ‘I love thee better then I did before, I thought thou hadst nere a peny. 20 ‘But if so be we needs must change, as change thou must abide, Though thou hast gotten Brock my mare, thou shalt not have my cow-hide.’ 21 The tanner took the good cow-hide, that of the cow was hilt, And threw it upon the king's saddle, That was so fairly guilt. 22 ‘Now help me, help me,’ quoth the tanner, ‘Full quickly that I were gone, For when I come home to Gillian my wife she'l say I'm a gentleman.’ 23 The king took the tanner by the leg, he girded a fart so round; ‘You'r very homely,’ said the king, ‘were I aware, I'd laid you o th' ground.’ 24 But when the tanner was in the king's saddle astonëd then he was; He knew not the stirrops that he did wear, whether they were gold or brass. 25 But when the steed saw the black cow-tale wag, for and the black cow-horn, The steed began to run away, as the divel the tanner had born. 26 Untill he came unto a nook, a little beside an ash; The steed gave the tanner such a fall his neck was almost brast. 27 ‘Take thy horse again, with a vengeance,’ he said, ‘with me he shall not abide;’ ‘It is no marvell,’ said the king, and laught, ‘he knew not your cow-hide. 28 ‘But if that we needs now must change, as change that well we mought, I'le swear to you plain, if you have your mare, I look to have some boot.’ 29 ‘What boot will you ask?’ quoth the tanner, ‘What boot will you ask on this ground?’ ‘No pence nor half-pence,’ said our king, ‘but a noble in gold so round.’ 30 ‘Here's twenty [good] groats,’ said the tanner, ‘and twenty more I have of thine; I have ten groats more in my purse, we'l drink five of them at the wine.’ 31 The king set a bugle-horne to his mouth, that blew both loud and shrill, And five hundred lords and knights came riding over a hill. 32 ‘Away, with a vengeance,’ quoth the tanner, ‘with thee I'le no longer abide; Thou art a strong thief, yonder be thy fellows, they will steal away my cow-hide.’ 33 ‘No, I protest,’ then said our king, ‘for so it may not be; They be the lords of Drayton Basset, come out of the North Country.’ 34 But when they came before the king full low they fell on their knee; The tanner had rather then a thousand pound he had been out of his company. 35 ‘A coller! a coller!’ then said the king, ‘a coller!’ then did he cry; Then would he have given a thousand pound he had not been so nigh. 36 ‘A coller? a coller?’ then quoth the tanner, ‘it is a thing which will breed sorrow; For after a coller commeth a halter, and I shall be hanged tomorrow.’ 37 ‘No, do not fear,’ the king did say; ‘for pastime thou hast shown me, No coller nor halter thou shalt have, but I will give thee a fee. 38 ‘For Plompton Park I will give thee, with tenements three beside, Which is worth three hundred pound a year, to maintain thy good cow-hide.’ 39 ‘Godamercy, Godamercy,’ quoth the tanner; ‘for this good deed thou hast done, If ever thou comest to merry Tamworth, thou shalt have clouting-leather for thy shone.’ 274 OUR GOODMAN OUR GOODMAN—A Herd's MSS, I, 140. 1 Hame came our goodman, And hame came he, And then he saw a saddle-horse, Where nae horse should be. 2 ‘What's this now, goodwife?

As recited by John Laurie, Abbeygreen. 1 'Twas in the merry month of June, When woods and gardens were all in bloom, When woods and gardens were all in bloom, And Phœbus shining clearly. 2 Did you not see your shepherd-swain, Feeding his flocks upon the plain, Feeding his flocks all one by one, And keeping them together? 3 Did you not see yon bonny green, Where dukes and lords and my love hath been, Where dukes and lords and my love hath been, And Phœbus shining clearly? 4 ‘O shepherd, shepherd, tell me indeed Which is the way you dou win your bread, Which is the way you dou win your bread, When feeding you give over?’ 5 ‘By making spindles I win my bread, By turning whorles in time of need, By turning whorles in time of need, Say, lassy, can you love me?’ 6 ‘I could love you manifold, As Jacob loved Rachel of old, As Jacob loved Rachel of old, So dearly could I love you.’ 7 ‘You must cast off these robes of silk, And put about my shepherd's cloak, And you must walk down at my back, Like a shepherd's bonny lassie.’ 8 She has cast off her robes of silk, And put about his shepherd's cloak, And she has walkd down at his back, Like a shepherd's bonny lassie. 9 O they walked up, and they walked down, Till this fair maiden she's wearyed grown; Says she, My dear, we'll go to some town, And there tak up our lodgings. 10 O whan they cam to his father's gate, Sae loudly, loudly as he did rap; Says she, My dear, we'll be found in fault For rapping here sae boldly. 11 But whan they cam to his father's hall, O loud, loud laughter they laughed all, Saying, Brother, I wish we had herded all, Ye've got sic an a bonny lassie. 12 Now this young couple they were wed, And all the way the flowers were spread, For in disguise they were married; She's now the young squire's lady. 281 THE KEACH I THE CREEL The Keach i the Creel THE KEACH I THE CREEL—A Whitelaw's Book of Scottish Ballads, p. 35; “taken down from the recitation of a gentleman in Liddesdale.” 1 A fair young may went up the street, Some white-fish for to buy, And a bonnie clerk's faen in love wi her, And he's followed her by and by, by, And he's followed her by and by. 2 ‘O where live ye, my bonnie lass, I pray thee tell to me; For gin the nicht were ever sae mirk I wad come and visit thee.’ 3 ‘O my father he aye locks the door, My mither keeps the key; And gin ye were ever sic a wily wight Ye canna win in to me.’ 4 But the clerk he had ae true brother, And a wily wight was he; And he has made a lang ladder, Was thirty steps and three. 5 He has made a cleek but and a creel, A creel but and a pin; And he's away to the chimley-top, And he's letten the bonnie clerk in. 6 The auld wife, being not asleep, Heard something that was said; ‘I'll lay my life,’ quo the silly auld wife, ‘There's a man i our dochter's bed.’ 7 The auld man he gat owre the bed, To see if the thing was true; But she's ta'en the bonny clerk in her arms, And coverd him owre wi blue. 8 ‘O where are ye gaun now, father?’ she says, ‘And where are ye gaun sae late? Ye've disturbd me in my evening prayers, And O but they were sweet!’ 9 ‘O ill betide ye, silly auld wife, And an ill death may ye die! She has the muckle buik in her arms, And she's prayin for you and me.’ 10 The auld wife being not asleep, Then something mair was said; ‘I'll lay my life,’ quo the silly auld wife, ‘There's a man i our dochter's bed.’ 11 The auld wife she got owre the bed, To see if the thing was true; But what the wrack took the auld wife's fit? For into the creel she flew. 12 The man that was at the chimley-top, Finding the creel was fu, He wrappit the rape round his left shouther, And fast to him he drew. 13 ‘O help! O help! O hinny, now, help! O help, O hinny, now! For him that ye aye wished me to He's carryin me off just now.’ 14 ‘O if the foul thief's gotten ye, I wish he may keep his haud; For a' the lee lang winter nicht Ye'll never lie in your bed.’ 15 He's towed her up, he's towed her down, He's towed her through an through; ‘O Gude assist!’ quo the silly auld wife, ‘For I'm just departin now.’ 16 He's towed her up, he's towed her down, He's gien her a richt down-fa, Till every rib i the auld wife's side Playd nick-nack on the wa. 17 O the blue, the bonnie, bonnie blue, And I wish the blue may do weel! And every auld wife that's sae jealous o her dochter, May she get a good keach i the creel! The Creel, or, Bonnie May THE KEACH I THE CREEL—B Communicated February, 1873, by Mr David Louden, of Morham, Haddington, N. B., as derived from Andrew Hastie, Rentonhall. 1 As bonnie may went up the street, Some sweetmeats for to buy, There was a young clerk followed after her, And followed her by and by, by, And followed her by and by. 2 ‘It's bonnie may, where do you stay? Or where is't that you be? Oh if the night be neer so dark, Awat I'll come and visit thee.’ 3 ‘My father locks the door at een, My mother keeps the key; Gin ye were neer sic a rovin blade, Ye canna win in to me.’ 4 The young clerk has a young brither, And a wily wag was he; He's made to him a long ladder, Wi thirty steps and three. 5 And he's put it to the chimney-top, And the creel he's put on a pin, And he's put it to the chimney-top, And he's let the young clerk in. 6 The auld wife she was standing by, She heard a word was said; ‘I could lay my life,’ said the silly auld wife, ‘There's a man in oor dochter's bed.’ 7 The auld man he cam doun the stairs To see if it were true; The young clerk was lying in bonnie may's arms, And she's covered him oer wi blue. 8 ‘Where are you going, dear father?’ she says, ‘Where are you going so late? You stopped me of my evening prayers, And oh, but they were sweet!’ 9 ‘The deil tak you, ye silly auld wife, And an ill death may ye dee! For your dochter was lyin wi the book in her arms, And she's prayin for you and me.’ 10 The auld wife still standin no far by, Still hearin a word, she said, ‘Ye may say as ye like, ye silly auld man, There's a man in oor dochter's bed.’ 11 I dinna ken what's taen the auld wife's fit, But into the creel she flew; The young clerk['s brither] being at the chimney-top, He found the creel was fu. 12 He's thrown the rope out-owre his shouther, And to him he did draw; He's drawn her up, he's drawn her doun, He's drawn her through and through. 13 Till the auld wife she began to cry, I'm just departin noo! But aye he drew her up and doun, And drew her through and through. 14 He's drawn her up, he's let her doun, He's gien her evendoun fall, Till every rib on the auld wife's side Played nick-nack on the wall. 15 It's O the blue, the bonnie, bonnie blue, I wish the blue may do weel! For every auld wife that is jealous o her dochter May be rockit to the d—l in a creel!

O faur ye gaun, my dow? There's naebody comes to my bedside, And naebody wins to you. 3 ‘Your brother is a gallant square-wright, A gallant square-wright is he; Ye'll gar him make a lang ladder, Wi thirty steps and three. 4 ‘And gar him big a deep, deep creel, A deep creel and a string, And ye'll come up to my bedside, And come bonnily linken in.’ 5 The auld gudeman and auld gudewife, To bed they went, to sleep; But wae mat worth the auld gudewife! A wink she coudna get. 6 ‘I dreamd a dreary dream this night, I wish it binna true, That the rottens had come thro the wa, And cutted the coverin blue.’ 7 Then up it raise the auld gudeman, To see gin it was true; And he's gane to his daughter dear, Says, What are ye doing, my dow? 8 ‘What are ye doing, my daughter dear? What are ye doing, my dow?’ ‘The prayer book's in my hand, father, Praying for my auld minnie and you.’ 9 The auld gudeman and auld gudewife, To bed they went, to sleep; But wae mat worth the auld gudewife! But aye she wakend yet. 10 ‘I dreamd a dreary dream this night, I wish it binna true, That the cunning clerk and your ae daughter Were aneath the coverin blue.’ 11 ‘O rise yoursell, gudewife,’ he says, ‘The diel may had you fast! Atween you and your ae daughter I canno get ae night's rest.’ 12 Up then raise the auld gudewife, To see gin it was true, And she fell arselins in the creel, And up the string they drew. 13 ‘Win up, win up, gudeman,’ she says, ‘Win up and help me now! For he that ye gae me to last night, I think he's catchd me now.’ 14 ‘Gin Auld Nick he has catchd you now, I wish he may had you fast; As for you and your ae daughter, I never get kindly rest.’ 15 They howded her, and they showded her, Till the auld wife gat a fa, And three ribs o the auld wife's side Gaed knip-knap ower in twa. The Covering Blue THE KEACH I THE CREEL—D Kinloch MSS, I, 276; from Alexander Kinnear, of Stonehaven. 1 ‘My father he locks the doors at nicht, My mither the keys carries ben, ben; There's naebody dare gae out,’ she says, ‘And as few dare come in, in, And as few dare come in.’ 2 ‘I will mak a lang ladder, Wi fifty steps and three, I will mak a lang ladder, And lichtly come doun to thee.’ 3 He has made a lang ladder, Wi fifty steps and three, He has made a lang ladder, And lichtly come doun the lum. 4 They had na kissd nor lang clappit, As lovers do whan they meet, Till the auld wife says to the auld man, I hear somebody speak. 5 ‘I dreamed a dreem sin late yestreen, And I'm feard my dream be true; I dreamd that the rottens cam thro the wa, And cuttit the covering blue. 6 ‘Ye'll rise, ye'll rise, my auld gudeman, And see gin this be true;’ ‘If ye're wanting rising, rise yoursel, For I wish the auld chiel had you.’ 7 ‘I dreamed a dream sin late yestreen, And I'm feard my dream be true; I dreamd that the clerk and our ae dother War rowed in the covering blue. 8 ‘Ye'll rise, ye'll rise, my auld gudeman, And see gin this be true:’ ‘If ye're wanting rising, rise yoursel, For I wish the auld chiel had you.’ 9 But up she raise, and but she gaes, And she fell into the gin; He gied the tow a clever tit, That brought her out at the lum. 10 ‘Ye'll rise, ye'll rise, my auld gudeman, Ye'll rise and come to me now, For him that ye've gien me sae lang till, I fear he has gotten me now.’ 11 ‘The grip that he's gotten, I wish he may haud, And never let it gae, For atween you and your ae dother I rest neither nicht nor day.’ 282 JOCK THE LEG AND THE MERRY MERCHANT JOCK THE LEG AND THE MERRY MERCHANT Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 165. 1 As Jock the Leg and the merry merchant Came from yon borrow's town, They took their budgets on their backs, And fieldert they were boun. 2 But they came to a tavern-house, Where chapmen used to be: ‘Provide, provide,’ said Jock the Leg, ‘A good supper for me. 3 ‘For the merry merchant shall pay it a', Tho it were good merks three;’ ‘But never a penny,’ said the merry merchant, ‘But shot, as it fa's me. 4 ‘A bed, a bed,’ said the merry merchant, ‘It's time to go to rest;’ ‘And that ye shall,’ said the good goodwife, ‘And your covrings o the best.’ 5 Then Jock the Leg in one chamber was laid, The merchant in another, And lockfast door atween them twa, That the one might not see the other. 6 But the merchant was not well lain down, Nor yet well fa'en asleep, Till up it starts him Jock the Leg, Just at the merchant's feet. 7 ‘Win up, win up,’ said Jock the Leg, ‘We might hae been miles three;’ ‘But never a foot,’ said the merry merchant, ‘Till day that I do see. 8 ‘For I cannot go by Barnisdale, Nor yet by Coventry; For Jock the Leg, that common thief, Would take my pack from me.’ 9 ‘I'll hae you in by Barnisdale, And down by Coventry, And I'll guard you frae Jock the Leg Till day that ye do see.’ 10 When they were in by Barnisdale, And in by Coventry, ‘Repeat, repeat,’ said Jock the Leg, ‘The words ye ance tauld me.’ 11 ‘I never said aught behind your back But what I'll say to thee; Are ye that robber, Jock the Leg, Will take my pack frae me?’ 12 ‘O by my sooth,’ said Jock the Leg, ‘You'll find that man I be; Surrender that pack that's on your back, Or then be slain by me.’ 13 He's ta'en his pack down frae his back, Set it below yon tree; Says, I will fight for my good pack Till day that I may see. 14 Then they fought there in good greenwood Till they were bloody men; The robber on his knees did fall, Said, Merchant, hold your hand. 15 ‘An asking, asking,’ said Jock the Leg, ‘An asking ye'll grant me;’ ‘Ask on, ask on,’ said the merry merchant, ‘For men to asking are free.’ 16 ‘I've dune little harm to you,’ he said, ‘More than you'd been my brother; Give me a blast o my little wee horn, And I'll give you another.’ 17 ‘A blast o your little wee horn,’ he said, ‘Of this I take no doubt; I hope you will take such a blast Ere both your eyes fly out.’ 18 He set his horn to his mouth, And he blew loud and shrill, And four-and-twenty bauld bowmen Came Jock the Leg until. 19 ‘Ohon, alas!’ said the merry merchant, ‘Alas! and woe is me! Sae many, a party o common thiefs, But nane to party me! 20 ‘Ye'll wile out six o your best bowmen, Yourself the seventh to be, And, put me one foot frae my pack, My pack ye shall have free.’ 21 He wiled six o his best bowmen, Himself the seventh to be, But [him] frae his pack they couldna get, For all that they could dee. 22 He's taen his pack into one hand, His broadsword in the other, And he slew five o the best bowmen, And the sixth he has dung over. 23 Then all the rest they gae a shout, As they stood by the tree; Some said they would this merchant head, Some said they'd let him be. 24 But Jock the Leg he then replied, To this I'll not agree; He is the boldest broadsword-man That ever I fought wi. 25 ‘If ye could wield the bow, the bow As ye can do the brand, I would hae you to good greenwood, To be my master's man.’ 26 ‘Tho I could wield the bow, the bow As I can do the brand, I would not gang to good greenwood, To join a robber-band.’ 27 ‘O give me some of your fine linen, To cleathe my men and me, And ye'se hae some of my dun deers' skins, Below yon greenwood-tree.’ 28 ‘Ye'se hae nane o my fine linen, To cleathe your men and thee, And I'll hae nane o your stown deers' skins, Below yon greenwood-tree.’ 29 ‘Ye'll take your pack upon your back, And travel by land or sea; In brough or land, wherever we meet, Good billies we shall be.’ 30 ‘I'll take my pack upon my back, And go by land or sea; In brough or land, wherever we meet, A rank thief I'll call thee.’ 283 THE CRAFTY FARMER THE CRAFTY FARMER a. ‘The Crafty Farmer,’ Logan, A Pedlar's Pack, p. 126, from a chap-book of 1796; ‘The Crafty Miller,’ Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, 1859, p. 208, from a Glasgow stall-copy; a stall-copy, printed by M.

And half the share thou shalt have;’ ‘Nay, by my faith,’ said the old man, ‘For once I have bitten a knave.’ 14 The thief he was not content, But he thought there must be bags; He out with his rusty old sword And chopt the old saddle in rags. 15 When he came to the landlord's house, This old man he was almost spent; Saying, Come, show me a private room And I'll pay you a whole year's rent. 16 ‘I've met a fond fool by the way, I swapt horses and gave him no boot; But never mind,’ said the old man, ‘For I got the fond fool by the foot.’ 17 He opend this rogue's portmantle, It was glorious to behold; There were three hundred pounds in silver, And three hundred pounds in gold. 18 And as he was riding home, And down a narrow lane, He espied his mare tied to a hedge, Saying, Prithee, Tib, wilt thou gang hame? 19 When he got home to his wife And told her what he had done, Up she rose and put on her clothes, And about the house did run. 20 She sung, and she sung, and she sung, She sung with a merry devotion, Saying, If ever our daughter gets wed, It will help to enlarge her portion. 284 JOHN DORY JOHN DORY Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia, London, 1609; No 1 of Freemen's Songs, sig.

O nay!’ then said our king, ‘O nay! this may not be, To yield to such a rover my self will not agree; He hath deceivd the French-man, likewise the King of Spain, And how can he be true to me that hath been false to twain?’ 4 With that our king provided a ship of worthy fame, Rainbow she is called, if you would know her name; Now the gallant Rainbow she rowes upon the sea, Five hundred gallant seamen to bear her company. 5 The Dutch-man and the Spaniard she made them for to flye, Also the bonny French-man, as she met him on the sea: When as this gallant Rainbow did come where Ward did lye, ‘Where is the captain of this ship?’ this gallant Rainbow did cry. 6 ‘O that am I,’ says Captain Ward, ‘there's no man bids me lye, And if thou art the king's fair ship, thou art welcome unto me:’ ‘I'le tell thee what,’ says Rainbow, ‘our king is in great grief That thou shouldst lye upon the sea and play the arrant thief, 7 ‘And will not let our merchants ships pass as they did before; Such tydings to our king is come, which grieves his heart full sore.’ With that this gallant Rainbow she shot, out of her pride, Full fifty gallant brass pieces, charged on every side. 8 And yet these gallant shooters prevailed not a pin, Though they were brass on the out-side, brave Ward was steel within; ‘Shoot on, shoot on,’ says Captain Ward, ‘your sport well pleaseth me, And he that first gives over shall yield unto the sea. 9 ‘I never wrongd an English ship, but Turk and King of Spain, For and the jovial Dutch-man as I met on the main. If I had known your king but one two years before, I would have savd brave Essex life, whose death did grieve me sore. 10 ‘Go tell the King of England, go tell him thus from me, If he reign king of all the land, I will reign king at sea.’ With that the gallant Rainbow shot, and shot, and shot in vain, And left the rover's company, and returnd home again. 11 ‘Our royal king of England, your ship's returnd again, For Ward's ship is so strong it never will be tane:’ ‘O everlasting!’ says our king, ‘I have lost jewels three, Which would have gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me. 12 ‘The first was Lord Clifford, Earl of Cumberland; The second was the lord Mountjoy, as you shall understand; The third was brave Essex, from field would never flee; Which would a gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.’ 288 THE YOUNG EARL OF ESSEX'S VICTORY OVER THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY Queen Elizabeth's Champion; or, Great Britain's Glory THE YOUNG EARL OF ESSEX'S VICTORY OVER THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY—A a.

Raderer two, tandaro te, Raderer, tandorer, tan do re. 2 The queen she provided a navy of ships, With sweet flying streamers, so glorious to see, Rich top and top-gallants, captains and lieutenants, Some forty, some fifty, brass-pieces and three. 3 They had not saild past a week on the seas, Not passing a week and days two or three, But they were aware of the proud emperor, Both him and all his proud company. 4 When he beheld our powerful fleet, Sailing along in their glory and pride, He was amazed at their valour and fame, Then to his warlike command[er]s he cry'd. 5 These were the words of the old emperor: Pray who is this that is sailing to me? If he be king that weareth a crown, Yet I am a better man than he. 6 ‘It is not a king, nor lord of a crown, Which now to the seas with his navy is come, But the young Earl of Essex, the Queen's lieutenant, Who fears no foes in Christendom.’ 7 ‘Oh! is that lord then come to the seas? Let us tack about and be steering away; I have heard so much of his father before That I will not fight with young Essex today.’ 8 O then bespoke the emperor's son, As they were tacking and steering away, ‘Give me, royal father, this navy of s[h]ips, And I will go fight with Essex today.’ 9 ‘Take them with all my heart, loving son, Most of them are of a capital size; But should he do as his father has done, Farewel thine honour and mine likewise.’ 10 With cannons hot and thundering shot, These two gallants fought on the main, And as it was young Essex's lot, The emperor's son by him was taen. 11 ‘Give me my son,’ the emperor cry'd, ‘Who you this day have taken from me, And I'll give to the[e] three keys of gold, The one shall be of High Germany.’ 12 ‘I care not for thy three keys of gold, Which thou hast profferd to set him free, But thy son he shall to England sail, And go before the queen with me.’ 13 ‘Then have I fifty good ships of the best, As good as ever were sent to the sea, And eer my son into England sail, They shall go all for good company.’ 14 They had not fought this famous battle, They had not fought it hours three, But some lost legs, and some lost arms, And some lay tumbling in the sea. 15 Essex he got this battle likewise, Tho't was the hotest that ever was seen; Home he returnd with a wonderful prize, And brought the emperor's son to the queen. 16 O then bespoke the prentices all, Living in London, both proper and tall, In a kind letter, sent straight to the queen, For Essex's sake they would fight all. Earl of Essex THE YOUNG EARL OF ESSEX'S VICTORY OVER THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY—B Kinloch MSS, I, 113. From Mary Barr, June, 1827. 1 ‘'Tis, old England, old England, I bid thee adieu, The drums and the trumpets command me frae shore; And you lusty fellows, both valiant and true, Will you venture with me where loud cannons roar?’ 2 ‘O Billy, O Billy, talk not of the seas, But stay at home with me on the shore; I'll do my endeavour thy fancy to please, And there's others to go where loud cannons roar.’ 3 ‘O Nelly, O Nelly, I must to the seas, For there is no gold to be had upon shore; There's honour, and gold, and riches likewise, To the man that doth die where loud cannons roar.’ 4 ‘Remember the winds, love, remember the waves, Remember the dangers that are upon seas; Remember there is neither coffin nor grave To the man that doth die where loud cannons roar.’ 5 ‘Remember old Benbow, and think on his blows; Remember the dangers he felt upon seas; He lost both his legs by one shot of his foes; He lost his sweet life, yet his honour's the more.’ 6 ‘Remember proud Shawfield, that honoured knight, Who came with his navy to the Spanish shore; At the rock of Salem his life took a flight, And with him there died some hundreds more.’ 7 ‘Our queen she has builded a navy of ships, And they are arrayed all right gloriously; With top and top-gallant, with captain, lieutenant, Some fifty, some sixty, brass pieces and three.’ 8 ‘Well, since you'll go, may my blessing advance, And carry you safely from Flanders to Spain; And when you've conquered that tyrant in France, Then my blessing return you to old England again.’ 9 They had not sailed one hour upon sea, Not one hour passing days two or three, Till up came the bold emperour, The bold emperour of High Germanie. 10 ‘O who is this?’ the bold emperour cries, ‘Who is this that comes sailing to me? I'm sure he's a knight, or a king of crown, Or I'm sure I am a far better fellow than he.’ 11 ‘I am neither a knight, nor a king of a crown, But here, with my navy, on board I am come; For I am Lord Essex, the Queen's lieutenant, Who never feard foe in all Christendom.’ 12 Out and spoke the bold emperour's son, All as they were mounting and hyeing away; ‘O father, lend me your navy of ships, And I'll go fight with Lord Essex today.’ 13 ‘O son, I'll lend thee my navy of ships, And they are all of a capable size; But if he be as good as his old father was, Adieu to your honour, and mine likewise.’ 14 O they have fought on at a terrible rate, Until it drew night to the cool of the day, And as it fell in young Essex's lot, The bold emperour's son he's taen prisoner away. 15 ‘O give me my son,’ the bold emperour cried, ‘O give me my son thou hast taken from me, And you shall have three keys of gold, And one of them opens High Germanie.’ 16 ‘What value I thy three keys of gold, Or any proud offer thou canst give to me? For up to old England thy son he must go, And stand before our queen's high majesty.’ 17 ‘'Tis I have fifteen ships of the best, And other fifteen distant on sea; Since up to old England my son he must go, Then we'll all go together for good companie.’ 289 THE MERMAID The Seamen's Distress THE MERMAID—A The Glasgow Lasses Garland, the second piece, British Museum, 11621. c. 3 (68). “Newcastle, 1765?” 1 As we lay musing in our beds, So well and so warm at ease, I thought upon those lodging-beds Poor seamen have at seas. 2 Last Easter day, in the morning fair, We was not far from land, Where we spied a mermaid on the rock, With comb and glass in hand. 3 The first came up the mate of our ship, With lead and line in hand, To sound and see how deep we was From any rock or sand. 4 The next came up the boatswain of our ship, With courage stout and bold: ‘Stand fast, stand fast, my brave lively lads, Stand fast, my brave hearts of gold!’ 5 Our gallant ship is gone to wreck, Which was so lately trimmd; The raging seas has sprung a leak, And the salt water does run in. 6 Our gold and silver, and all our cloths, And all that ever we had, We forced was to heave them overboard, Thinking our lives to save. 7 In all, the number that was on board Was five hundred and sixty-four, And all that ever came alive on shore There was but poor ninety-five. 8 The first bespoke the captain of our ship, And a well-spoke man was he; ‘I have a wife in fair Plymouth town, And a widow I fear she must be.’ 9 The next bespoke the mate of our ship, And a well-bespoke man was he; ‘I have a wife in fair Portsmouth, And a widow I fear she must be.’ 10 The next bespoke the boatswain of our ship, And a well-bespoke man was he; ‘I have a wife in fair Exeter, And a widow I fear she must be.’ 11 The next bespoke the little cabbin-boy, And a well-bespoke boy was he; ‘I am as sorry for my mother dear As you are for your wives all three. 12 ‘Last night, when the moon shin'd bright, My mother had sons five, But now she may look in the salt seas And find but one alive.’ 13 ‘Call a boat, call a boat, you little Plymouth boys, Don't you hear how the trumpet[s] sound? [For] the want of our boat our gallant ship is lost, And the most of our merry men is drownd.’ 14 Whilst the raging seas do roar, And the lofty winds do blow, And we poor seamen do lie on the top, Whilst the landmen lies below.

I am more grievd for my daddy and my mammy Than you for your wives all three.’ 6 Then three times round went our gallant ship, And three times round went she; For the want of a life-boat they all went down, And she sank to the bottom of the sea.

While the raging seas did roar, And the stormy winds did blow, And we jolly sailor-boys were up, up aloft, And the landsmen were lying down below, And the landlubbers all down below, below, below, And the landlubbers all down below. 2 Then up spoke the captain of our gallant ship, Who at once did our peril see; I have married a wife in fair London town, And tonight she a widow will be.’ 3 And then up spoke the litel cabin-boy, And a fair-haired boy was he; ‘I've a father and mother in fair Portsmouth town, And this night she will weep for me.’ 4 Now three times round goes our gallant ship, And three times round went she; For the want of a life-boat they all were drownd, As she went to the bottom of the sea.

And the raging seas do foam, foam, And the stormy winds do blow, While we poor sailors must mount to the top, When the landsmen they lye low. 2 Out and spoke the captain of our ship, And a fine little man was he; ‘O I've a wife in fair London town, And a widow this night she shall be.’ 3 Out and spoke the mate of our ship, And a tight little man was he; ‘O I've a wife in Dublin city, And a widow this night she shall be.’ 4 Out and spoke our second mate, And a clever little man was he; ‘Oh I have a wife in Greenock town, And a widow this night she shall be.’ 5 Out and spoke our little prentice boy, And a fine little boy was he; ‘Oh I am sorry for my mother,’ he said, ‘As you are for your wives all three.’ 6 Out and spoke the cook of our ship, And a rusty old dog was he; Says, I am as sorry for my pats and my pans As you are for your wives all three. Greenland THE MERMAID—F Kinloch MSS, VII, 245. From the recitation of a little boy from Glasgow, who sang it in Grove St., Edinburgh, July, 1826. 1 Greenland, Greenland, is a bonny, bonny place, Whare there's neither grief nor flowr, Whare there's neither grief nor tier to be seen, But hills and frost and snow. 2 Up starts the kemp o the ship, Wi a psalm-book in his hand: ‘Swoom away, swoom away, my merry old boys, For you'll never see dry land.’ 3 Up starts the gaucy cook, And a weil gaucy cook was he; ‘I wad na gie aw my pans and my kettles For aw the lords in the sea.’ 4 Up starts the kemp o the ship, Wi a bottle and a glass intil his hand; ‘Swoom away, swoom away, my merry old sailors, For you'll never see dry land.’ 5 O the raging seas they row, row, row, The stormy winds do blow, As sune as he had gane up to the tap, As low. 290 THE WYLIE WIFE OF THE HIE TOUN HIE My lady ye shall be THE WYLIE WIFE OF THE HIE TOUN HIE—A “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 72, Thomas Wilkie's MS., 1813-15, p. 74, Abbotsford; taken down from the recitation of a female friend, who sang it to a lively air. 1 It fell about the Martinmas, When the gentlemen were drinking there wine, And a' the discourse that they had Was about the ladies they gude fine. 2 It's up an spake a tall young man, The tallest o the companie; ‘The bonniest lass that I ken off She lives into the hee toun hee. 3 ‘O I would give a guinea of gold, A guinea and a pint of wine, I would give it to the hostler's wife, For to wile that bonny lassie in.’ 4 The hostler's wife gaed down the stair, And she's looked hersell round near by, And there she spied the bonny handsom girl, Coming walking down the hee town high. 5 ‘Come in, come in, my bonny handsom girl, Come speak one word with me; Come taste a little of our wine, For it's new come out of Italie.’ 6 So willillie she wil'd her up, And so willillie she wil'd her in, And so cunningly she's locked the door, And she's comd down the stair again. 7 One of them took her by the milk-white hand, And he's laid her body on the ground, And aye she sightd, and said, Alass, 'Tis a sin to do me wrong! 8 ‘But since ye hae done sae muckle to me, And brought me to so muckle shame, O wad ye be so kind to me As to tell to me your name.’ 9 ‘O if I tell to you my name, It's a thing I never did to none; But I will tell to the, my dear; I am the Earl of Beaton's son.’ 10 When two years were past and gone, This gentleman came walking by, And there he spied the bonny handsome girl, Coming walking down the hie town high. 11 ‘To whom belongs that pretty child, That blinks with its pretty eye?’ ‘His father's from home and has left me alone, And I have been at the fold milking my ky.’ 12 ‘You lie, you lie, my bonny handsome girl, So loudlie I hear you lie; O do not you mind that happie day When ye was drinking the wine wi me?’ 13 He's lighted off his milk-white steed, He's kissd her both cheeck and chin; He's made a' the servants in Beaton castle To welcome this fair lady in.

Or take you your keen bright sword And rid me out of my life.’ 2 ‘Say no more so then, lady, Say you no more then so, For you shall into the wild forrest, And amongst the buck and doe. 3 ‘Where thou shalt eat of the hips and haws, And the roots that are so sweet, And thou shalt drink of the cold water, That runs underneath [thy] feet.’ 4 Now she had not been in the wild forrest Passing three months and a day But with hunger and cold she had her fill, Till she was quite worn away. 5 At last she saw a fair tyl'd-house, And there she swore by the rood That she would to that fair tyl'd-house, There for to get her some food. 6 But when she came unto the gates, Aloud, aloud she cry'd, An alms, an alms, my own sister! I ask you for no pride. 7 Her sister calld up her merry men all, By one, by two, and by three, And bid them hunt away that wild doe, As far as ere they could see. 8 They hunted her ore hill and dale, And they hunted her so sore That they hunted her into the forrest, Where her sorrows grew more and more. 9 She laid a stone all at her head, And another all at her feet, And down she lay between these two, Till death had lulld her asleep. 10 When sweet Will came and stood at her head, And likewise stood at her feet, A thousand times he kist he[r] cold lips, Her body being fast asleep. 11 Yea, seaven times he stood at her feet, And seaven times at her head, A thousand times he shook her hand, Although her body was dead. 12 ‘Ah wretched me!’ he loudly cry'd, ‘What is it that I have done? O woud to the powers above I'de dy'd, When thus I left her alone! 13 ‘Come, come, you gentle red-breast now, And prepare for us a tomb, Whilst unto cruel Death I bow, And sing like a swan my doom. 14 ‘Why could I ever cruel be Unto so fair a creature? Alas! she dy'd for love of me, The loveliest she in nature! 15 ‘For me she left her home so fair To wander in this wild grove, And there with sighs and pensive care She ended her life for love. 16 ‘O constancy, in her thou'rt lost! Now let women boast no more; She's fled unto the Elizium coast, And with her carryd the store. 17 ‘O break, my heart, with sorrow filld, Come, swell, you strong tides of grief! You that my dear love have killd, Come, yield in death to me relief. 18 ‘Cruel her sister, was't for me That to her she was unkind? Her husband I will never be, But with this my love be joynd. 19 ‘Grim Death shall tye the marriage-bands, Which jealousie shan't divide; Together shall tye our cold hands, Whilst here we lye side by side. 20 ‘Witness, ye groves, and chrystial streams, How faithless I late have been, But do repent with dying leaves Of that my ungrateful sin; 21 ‘And wish a thousand times that I Had been but to her more kind, And not have let a virgin dye Whose equal there's none can find. 22 ‘Now heaps of sorrow press my soul; Now, now 't is she takes her way; I come, my love, without controule, Nor from thee will longer stay.’ 23 With that he fetchd a heavy groar Which rent his tender breast, And then by her he laid him down, When as death did give him rest. 24 Whilst mournful birds, with leavy boughs, To them a kind burial gave, And warbled out their love-sick vows, Whilst they both slept in their grave.

O happy were the man,’ he sayes, ‘That had thee to his bride, To ly down by his side; Then he were not to mean;’ But still she let the tears down fall For pleasant Hasilgreen. 3 ‘Oh what for a man is Hasillgreen? Sweet heart, pray tell to me.’ ‘He is a propper gentleman, Dwels in the South Countrie; With shoulders broad and arms long, And comely to be seen; His hairs are like the threeds of gold, My pleasant Hasilgreen.’ 4 ‘Now Hasilgreen is married, Let all this talking be.’ ‘If Hasilgreen be married, This day then woe to me; For I may sigh and sob no more, But close my weeping een, And hold my peace and cry no more, But dy for Hasilgreen.’ 5 ‘Will you let Hasilgreen alone, And go along with me? I'll marry you on my eldest son, Make you a gay lady.’ ‘Make me a gay lady?’ she sayes, ‘I am a maid too mean; I'll rather stay at home,’ she cries, ‘And dy for Hasilgreen.’ 6 He takes this pretty maid him behind And fast he spurred the horse, And they're away to Bigger toun, Then in to Biggar Cross. Their lodging was far sought, And so was it foreseen; But still she let the tears doun fall For pleasant Hasillgreen. 7 He's ta'en this pretty maid by the hand, And he is doun the toun; He bought for her a pettycoat, Yea, and a trailing goun; A silken kell fitt for her head, Laid oer with silver sheen; But still she let the tears doun fall For pleasant Hasilgreen. 8 He's taen this bony mey him behind, And he is to the Place, Where there was mirth and merryness, And ladyes fair of face; And ladyes fair of face, Right seemly to be seen, But still she let the tears doun fall For pleasant Hasilgreen. 9 Young Hasilgreen ran hastilie To welcome his father dear; He's ta'en that pretty maid in his arms, And kist off her falling tear: ‘O bony mey, now for thy sake I would be rent and rien; I would give all my father's lands To have thee in Hasilgreen.’ 10 ‘O hold your tongue now, son,’ he sayes, ‘Let no more talking be; This maid has come right far from home This day to visit thee. This day should been your wedding-day, It shall be thy bridall-een, And thou's get all thy father's lands, And dwell in Hasillgreen.’ Jock o Hazelgreen JOHN OF HAZELGREEN—B Kinloch's MSS, VII, 135; from the recitation of Jenny Watson, Lanark, 24 April, 1826. 1 It was on a morning early, Before day-licht did appear, I heard a pretty damsel Making a heavy bier; Making a heavy bier, I wonderd what she did mean; But ay the tears they rappit doun, Crying, O Jock o Hazelgreen! 2 ‘O whare is this Hazelgreen, maid? That I may him see.’ ‘He is a ticht and a proper man, Lives in the South Cuntree. His shoulders broad, his arms lang, O he's comely to be seen!’— But ay the tears they drappit doun For Jock o Hazelgreen. 3 ‘Will ye gang wi me, fair maid? And I'll marry ye on my son,’ ‘Afore I'd go along wi you, To be married on your son, I'd rather choose to stay at hame, And die for Hazelgreen.’ 4 But he has tane her up behind, And spurred on his horse, Till ance he cam to Embro toun, And lichted at the corss. He bought to her a petticoat, Besides a handsome goun; He tied a silver belt about her waist, Worth thrice three hunder pund. 5 And whan he cam to Hazelyetts, He lichted doun therein; Monie war the brave ladies there, Monie ane to be seen. She lichted doun amang them aw, She seemed to be the queen; But ay the tears they rappit doun For Jock o Hazelgreen. 6 Young Hazelgreen took her by the hand And led her out and in: Said, Bonnie lady, for your sake, I could be baith rent and rien; I wad gie aw my lands and rents, Tho I had kingdoms three, If I could hae the great pleasure To enjoy thy fair bodie. 7 ‘No more of this,’ his father said, ‘Of your mourning let abee; I brought the damsel far frae hame, She's thrice as wae for thee. The morn is your bridal-day, The nicht is your bridal-een, And I'll gie you aw my lands and rents, My pleasing son, Hazelgreen.’ John o Hazelgreen JOHN OF HAZELGREEN—C Kinloch MSS, I, 319. 1 As I gaed out in a May morning, Afore that I could see, And there I heard a pretty fair may Making sweet melodie. She was making sic melodie, I wonderd what she could mean; But ay she sang and sang about Sweet John o Hazelgreen. 2 ‘O what na man is Hazelgreen? Fair may, pray tell to me.’ ‘He is a stout and a tall young man As in a' the South Countrie. He is a stout and a tall young man, And comely to be seen; But still O I maun weep and wail For John o Hazelgreen.’ 3 ‘Hold your tongue, fair maid,’ he says, ‘And let your weeping alane; I'll marry you to my eldest son, And you shall be ca'd my dame.’ 4 He has tane her on ahint him, And fast he spurred the steed; For Edinbro town he there was bound, Where they soon came wi speed. 7 He's tane her to the Luckenbooths, Coft her a braw new gown, A handsome feather for her hat, And a pair o silken shoon. 8 He has tane the fair may up again, And fast awa rode he; For Hazelgreen now he was bound, Her lodging there to be. 9 She jumped aff frae ahint him, As fair as any queen; ‘Come down, come down, Lord John,’ he says, ‘And welcome your lady hame. 10 ‘It is the tall and comely youth, Sweet John o Hazelgreen; If we canna see it bridal-day, It shall be bridal-een.’ John o Hazelgreen; or, Jock of Hazelgreen JOHN OF HAZELGREEN—D a.

Says, Who has done you the wrong, fair maid, And left you here alane? Or who has kissd your lovely lips, That ye ca Hazelgreen? 3 ‘Hold your tongue, kind sir,’ she said, ‘And do not banter so; How will ye add affliction Unto a lover's woe? For none's done me the wrong,’ she said, ‘Nor left me here alane; Nor none has kissd my lovely lips, That I ca Hazelgreen.’ 4 ‘Why weep ye by the tide, lady? Why weep ye by the tide? How blythe and happy might he be Gets you to be his bride! Gets you to be his bride, fair maid, And him I'll no bemean; But when I take my words again, Whom call ye Hazelgreen? 5 ‘What like a man was Hazelgreen? Will ye show him to me?’ ‘He is a comely, proper youth I in my sleep did see; Wi arms tall, and fingers small, He's comely to be seen;’ And aye she loot the tears down fall For John o Hazelgreen. 6 ‘If ye'll forsake young Hazelgreen, And go along with me, I'll wed you to my eldest son, Make you a lady free.’ ‘It's for to wed your eldest son I am a maid oer mean; I'll rather stay at home,’ she says ‘And die for Hazelgreen.’ 7 ‘If ye'll forsake young Hazelgreen, And go along with me, I'll wed you to my second son, And your weight o gowd I'll gie.’ ‘It's for to wed your second son I am a maid oer mean; I'll rather stay at home,’ she says, ‘And die for Hazelgreen.’ 8 Then he's taen out a siller comb, Combd down her yellow hair; And lookëd in a diamond bright, To see if she were fair. ‘My girl, ye do all maids surpass That ever I have seen; Cheer up your heart, my lovely lass, And hate young Hazelgreen.’ 9 ‘Young Hazelgreen he is my love, And ever mair shall be; I'll nae forsake young Hazelgreen For a' the gowd ye'll gie.’ But aye she sighd, and said, Alas! And made a piteous meen, And aye she loot the tears down fa For John o Hazelgreen. 10 He lookëd high, and lighted low, Set her upon his horse; And they rode on to Edinburgh, To Edinburgh's own cross. And when she in that city was, She lookd like ony queen: ‘'Tis a pity such a lovely lass Shoud love young Hazelgreen.’ 11 ‘Young Hazelgreen, he is my love, And ever mair shall be; I'll nae forsake young Hazelgreen For a' the gowd ye'll gie.’ And aye she sighd, and said, Alas! And made a piteous meen, And aye she loot the tears down fa For John o Hazelgreen. 12 ‘Now hold your tongue, my well-fard maid, Lat a' your mourning be, And a' endeavours I shall try To bring that youth to thee, If ye'll tell me where your love stays, His stile and proper name.’ ‘He's laird o Taperbank,’ she says, ‘His stile, Young Hazelgreen.’ 13 Then he has coft for that lady A fine silk riding-gown, Likewise he coft for that lady A steed, and set her on; Wi menji feathers in her hat, Silk stockings and siller sheen, And they are on to Taperbank, Seeking young Hazelgreen. 14 They nimbly rode along the way, And gently spurrd their horse, Till they rode on to Hazelgreen, To Hazelgreen's own close. Then forth he came, young Hazelgreen, To welcome his father free: ‘You're welcome here, my father dear, And a' your companie.’ 15 But when he lookd oer his shoulder, A light laugh then gae he; Says, If I getna this lady, It's for her I must die. I must confess this is the maid I ance saw in a dream, A walking thro a pleasant shade, As fair's a cypress queen. 16 ‘Now hold your tongue, young Hazelgreen, Lat a' your folly be; If ye be wae for that lady, She's thrice as wae for thee. She's thrice as wae for thee, my son, As bitter doth complain; Well is she worthy o the rigs That lie on Hazelgreen.’ 17 He's taen her in his arms twa, Led her thro bower and ha: ‘Cheer up your heart, my dearest dear, Ye're flower out-oer them a'. This night shall be our wedding-een, The morn we'll say, Amen; Ye'se never mair hae cause to mourn, Ye're lady o Hazelgreen.’ JOHN OF HAZELGREEN—E a. “Got in the South County by Mr Pringle:” Kinloch's MSS, I, 321. b.

For his love I valu'd not, Whether that he could fancy me Or whether he could not. 4 ‘He sent me his letter back again, That he lay dangerous sick, That I might then go speedily To give him up his faith.’ 5 Now you shall hear what love she had Then for this love-sick man; She was a whole long summer's day In a mile a going on. 6 When she came to her love's bed-side, Where he lay dangerous sick, She could not for laughing stand Upright upon her feet. 7 She had a white wand all in her hand, And smoothd it all on his breast; ‘In faith and troth come pardon me, I hope your soul's at rest. 8 ‘I'll do as much for my true-love As other maidens may; I'll dance and sing on my love's grave A whole twelvemonth and a day.’ THE BROWN GIRL—B Taken down lately by Rev. S. Baring-Gould from a blacksmith, parish of Thrushleton, Devon. 1 ‘I am as brown as brown can be, And my eyes as black as sloe; I am as brisk as brisk can be, And wild as forest doe. 2 ‘My love he was so high and proud, His fortune too so high, He for another fair pretty maid Me left and passed me by. 3 ‘Me did he send a love-letter, He sent it from the town, Saying no more he loved me, For that I was so brown. 4 ‘I sent his letter back again, Saying his love I valued not, Whether that he would fancy me, Whether that he would not. 5 ‘When that six months were overpassd, Were overpassd and gone, Then did my lover, once so bold, Lie on his bed and groan. 6 ‘When that six months were overpassd, Were gone and overpassd, O then my lover, once so bold, With love was sick at last. 7 ‘First sent he for the doctor-man: ‘You, doctor, me must cure; The pains that now do torture me I can not long endure.’ 8 ‘Next did he send from out the town, O next did send for me; He sent for me, the brown, brown girl Who once his wife should be. 9 ‘O neer a bit the doctor-man His sufferings could relieve; O never an one but the brown, brown girl Who could his life reprieve.’ 10 Now you shall hear what love she had For this poor love-sick man, How all one day, a summer's day, She walked and never ran. 11 When that she came to his bedside, Where he lay sick and weak, O then for laughing she could not stand Upright upon her feet. 12 ‘You flouted me, you scouted me, And many another one; Now the reward is come at last, For all that you have done.’ 13 The rings she took from off her hands, The rings by two and three: ‘O take, O take these golden rings, By them remember me.’ 14 She had a white wand in her hand, She strake him on the breast: ‘My faith and troth I give back to thee, So may thy soul have rest.’ 15 ‘Prithee,’ said he, ‘forget, forget, Prithee forget, forgive; O grant me yet a little space, That I may be well and live.’ 16 ‘O never will I forget, forgive, So long as I have breath; I'll dance above your green, green grave Where you do lie beneath.’ 296 WALTER LESLY Walter Lesly Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 139. 1 On the second of October, a Monday at noon, In came Walter Lesly, to see his proper one; He set a chair down by her side, and gently sat her by, Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye? 2 He's taen a glass into his hand, inviting her to drink, But little knew she his meaning, or what the rogue did think; Nor what the rogue did think, to steal the maid away; ‘Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?’ 3 When they had taen a glass or two, and all were making merry, In came Geordy Lesly, and forth he did her carry; Then upon high horseback sae hard's he did her tye, ‘Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?’ 4 Her mother she came to the door, the saut tears on her cheek, She coudna see her daughter, it was for dust and reek; It was for dust and reek, the swords they glancd sae high; ‘And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?’ 5 When they came to the ale-house, the people there were busy; A bridal-bed it was well made, and supper well made ready; When the supper down was set, baith plumpudding and pie, ‘And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?’ 6 When they had eaten and well drunken, and a' man bound for bed, The laddie and the lassie in ae chamber were laid; He quickly stript her to the smock, and gently laid her bye, Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye? 7 But Walter being weary, he fell fast asleep, And then the lassie thought it fit to start up till her feet; To start up till her feet, and her petticoats to tye, ‘We'll go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.’ 8 Then over moss and over muir sae cleverly she ran, And over hill and over dale, without stockings or shoon; The men pursued her full fast, wi mony shout and cry, Says, Will ye go to Conland, the winter-time to lye. 9 ‘Wae to the dubs o Duffus land, that eer they were sae deep; They've trachled a' our horsemen and gart our captain sleep; And gart our captain sleep, and the lassie win away, And she'll go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.’ 10 ‘I'd rather be in Duffus land, selling at the ale, Before I was wi Lesly, for a' his auld meal; For a' his auld meal, and sae mony comes to buy; I'll go no more to Conland the winter-time to lye. 11 ‘I'd rather be in Duffus land, dragging at the ware, Before I was wi Lesly, for a' his yellow hair; For a' his yellow hair, and sae well's he can it tye; I'll go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.’ 12 It was not for her beauty, nor yet her gentle bluid, But for her mither's dollars, of them he had great need; Of them he had great need, now he maun do them by, For she'll go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye. 297 EARL ROTHES Earl Rothes Kinloch MSS, I, 333. 1 ‘O Earl Rothes, an thou wert mine, And I were to be thy ladie, I wad drink at the beer, and tipple at the wine, And be my bottle with any.’ 2 ‘Hold thy tongue, sister Ann,’ he says, ‘Thy words they are too many; What wad ye do wi sae noble a lord, When he has so noble a ladie? 3 ‘O I'll pay you your tocher, Lady Ann, Both in gear and money, If ye'll forsake Earl Rothes's companie, And mind that he has a ladie.’ 4 ‘I do not value your gold,’ she says, ‘Your gear it's no sae readie; I'll neer forsake Earl Rothes's companie, And I don't gie a fig for his ladie.’ 5 ‘I'll keep ye i the castle, Lady Ann, O servants ye shall hae monie; I'll keep ye till ye're safely brocht to bed, And I'll mak you a marquis's ladie.’ 6 ‘I do not value your castle,’ she says, ‘Your servants are no sae readie; Earl Rothes will keep me till I'm brocht to bed, And he'll mak me a marquis's ladie.’ 7 ‘Woe be to thee, Earl Rothes,’ he says, ‘And the mark o the judge be upon thee, For the using o this poor thing sae, For the using my sister so badly. 8 ‘When I'm come to the years of a man, And able a sword to carry, I'll thrust it thro Earl Rothes' bodie For the using my sister sae basely. 9 ‘Fare thee well, Lady Ann,’ he says, ‘No longer will I tarry; You and I will never meet again, Till we meet at the bonny town o Torry.’ 298 YOUNG PEGGY Young Peggy Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 153. 1 ‘O whare hae ye been, Peggy? O whare hae ye been?’ ‘I the garden amang the gilly-flowrs, Atween twal hours and een.’ 2 ‘Ye've na been there your leen, Peggy, Ye've na been there your leen; Your father saw you in Jamie's arms, Atween twal hours and een.’ 3 ‘Tho my father saw me in Jamie's arms, He'll see me there again; For I will sleep in Jamie's arms When his grave's growin green.’ 4 ‘Your Jamie is a rogue, Peggy, Your Jamie is a loun, For trysting out our ae dochter, And her sae very young.’ 5 ‘Lay no the wyte on Jamie, mither, The blame a' lies on me; For I will sleep in Jamie's arms When your een winna see.’ 6 Now she has to her ain bouer gane; He was waiting there him leen: ‘I'm blythe to see ye, Jamie, here, For we maunna meet again.’ 7 She's tane the wine-glass in her hand, Pourd out the wine sae clear; Says, Here's your health and mine, Jamie, And we maun meet na mair. 8 She has tane him in her arms twa, And gien him kisses five; Says, Here's your health and mine, Jamie, I wish weel mote ye thrive. 9 ‘Your father has a bonnie cock, Divides the nicht and day, And at the middle watch o the nicht In greenwud ye'll meet me.’ 10 Whan bells war rung, and mass was sung, And a' men boun for bed, She's kilted up her green claithing, And met Jamie in the wud. 11 Whan bells war rung, and mass was sung, About the hour o twa, It's up bespak her auld father, Says, Peggy is awa! 12 ‘Ga saddle to me the black, the black, Ga saddle to me the grey;’ But ere they wan to the tap o the hill The wedding was a' bye. 299 TROOPER AND MAID The Trooper and Fair Maid TROOPER AND MAID—A 1 One evening as a maid did walk, The moon was shining clearly, She heard a trooper at the gates, She thought it was her dearie. She's taen his horse then by the head, And led him to the stable, And gien to him baith corn and hay, To eat what he was able. Bonny lass, gin I come near you, Bonny lass, gin I come near you, I'll gar a' your ribbons reel, Bonny lass, or eer I lea you. 2 She's taen the trooper by the hand, And led him to the table, And furnishd him wi bread and cheese, To eat what he was able. She's taen the wine-glass in her hand, Poured out the wine sae clearly; ‘Here is your health an mine,’ she cried, ‘And ye're welcome hame, my deary! 3 ‘A glass o wine for gentlemen, And bonny lads for lasses, And bread and cheese for cavaliers, And corn and hay for asses.’ Then she went but and made his bed, She made it like a lady, And she coost aff her mankie gown, Says, Laddie, are you ready? 4 Then he coost aff his big watch-coat, But and his silken beaver, A pair o pistols frae his side, And he lay down beside her. ‘Bonny lassie, I am wi you now, Bonny lassie I am wi you, But I'll gar a' your ribbons reel, Bonny lassie, ere I lea you.’ 5 The trumpet sounds thro Birldale, Says, Men and horse, make ready; The drums do beat at Staneman hill, ‘Lads, leave your mam and daddie.’ The fifes did play at Cromley banks, ‘Lads, leave the lewes o Fyvie;’ And then the trooper he got up, Says, Lassie, I must lea you. 6 ‘Bonny lassie, I maun lea you now, Bonny lassie, I maun lea you; But if ever I come this road again, I will come in and see you.’ 7 She's taen her gown out-ower her arms, And followed him to Stirling, And aye the trooper he did say, O turn ye back, my darling. ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When rashin rinds grow gay gowd rings, I winna langer tarry.’ 8 ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When heather-knaps grow siller taps, I winna langer tarry.’ ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When heather-cows grow owsen-bows, I winna langer tarry.’ 9 ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When cockle-shells grow siller bells, I winna langer tarry.’ ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When apple-trees grow in the seas, I winna langer tarry.’ 10 ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When fishes fly, and seas gang dry, I winna langer tarry.’ ‘O when will we twa meet again? Or when will you me marry?’ ‘When frost and snaw shall warm us a', I winna langer tarry.’ 11 ‘Yestreen I was my daddie's dow, But an my mamy's dawtie; This night I gang wi bairn to you, Wae's me that I eer saw thee!’ ‘Yestreen ye were your daddie's dow, But an your mammie's dawtie; But gin ye gang wi bairn to me, Ye may rue that eer ye saw me. 12 ‘O turn back, my bonny lass, And turn back, my dearie; For the Highland hills are ill to climb, And the bluidy swords woud fear ye.’ The Trooper TROOPER AND MAID—B Motherwell's MS., p. 27; from the recitation of Widow Nicol. 1 There cam a trooper frae the West, And of riding he was weary; He rappit at and clappit at, In calling for his dearie. By chance the maid was in the close, The moon was shining clearly, She opened the gates and let him in, Says, Ye're welcome hame, my dearie. 2 She took the horse by the bridle-reins And led him to the stable; She gave him corn and hay to eat, As much as he was able. She up the stair and made the bed, She made it fit for a lady, Then she coost aff her petticoat, Said, Trooper, are ye ready? 3 ‘There's bread and cheese for musqueteers, And corn and hay for hor[s]es, Sack and sugar for auld wives, And lads for bonnie lasses.’ 4 He coost aff his gude buff coat, His boots, likewise his beaver, He drew his rapier frae his side, And streekit him down beside her. ‘Bonnie lass, I trew I'm near the[e] now, Bonnie lass, I trew I'm near thee, And I'll gar a' thy ribbons reel, Bonnie lassie, or I lea thee.’ 5 They had but spoken little a while Till of speaking they were weary; They sleeped together in each other's arms Till the sun was shining clearly. The very first sound the trumpet gave Was, Troopers, are ye ready? Away you must to London town, Or else for Londonderry. 6 She took the bottle in her hand, The glass into the other, She filled it up with blood-red wine, Until it ran quite over. She drank a health to her love on the stair, Saying, When shall we two marry? Or when shall we two meet again, On purpose for to marry? 7 ‘O when shall we two meet again? Or when shall we two marry?’ ‘When cockle-shells grow siller bells; No longer must I tarry.’ TROOPER AND MAID—C Jamieson, Popular Ballads, II, 158, as often heard by him in Morayshire. 1 There cam a trooper frae the west, And he's ridden till his deary; ‘It's open and lat me in,’ he says, For I am wet and weary.’ 2 ‘O whan sall we be married, love? O whan sall we be married?’ ‘Whan heather-cows turn owsen-bows, It's then that we'll be married.’ 3 ‘O whan sall we be married, love? O when sall we be married?’ ‘When cockle-shells turn siller bells, It's then that we'll be married.’ 4 ‘Whan the sun and moon dance on the green, It's then that we'll be married.’ The Trooper Lad TROOPER AND MAID—D Communicated by Mr Macmath, with this note: “Received, 21st August, 1895, at Crossmichael, from my aunt, Miss Jane Webster. Learned by her many years ago, at Airds of Kells, from the singing of John Coltart.” 1 The trooper lad cam to oor gate, And oh! but he was weary, He rapped at and chapped at, Syne called for his kind deary. 2 The bonnie lass being in the close, The moon was shining clearly, — ‘Ye'r welcome here, my trooper lad, Ye'r welcome, my kind deary.’ 3 She's taen his horse by the bridle-reins, And led him to the stable, She's gien him corn and hay to eat, As much as he was able. 4 She's taen the knight by the milk-white hand, And led him to her chamber, And gied him bread and cheese to eat, And wine to drink his pleasure. 5 ‘Bonnie lassie, I'll lie near ye noo, Bonnie lassie, I'll lie near ye, An I'll gar a' your ribbons reel In the morning or I leave ye.’ 6 And she put off her wee white smock, Crying, ‘Laddie, are ye ready?’ 7 The first time that the trumpet played Was, Up, up and awa, man! The next time that the trumpet played Was, The morn's the battle-day, man! 8 ‘Bonnie lassie, I maun leave ye noo, Bonnie lassie, I maun leave ye; But, if e'er I come this way again I will ca in an see ye.’ 9 Bread and cheese for gentlemen, An corn and hay for horses; Pipes and tobacco for auld wives, And bonnie lads for lasses. 10 ‘When will us twa meet again? When will we meet and marry?’ ‘When cockle-shells turn silver bells, Nae langer, love, we'll tarry.’ 11 So he's taen his auld grey cloak about him noo, An he's ower the mountains fairly, Crying, ‘Fare ye weel, my bonnie lass, Fareweel, my ain kind deary.’ 300 BLANCHEFLOUR AND JELLYFLORICE Blancheflour and Jellyflorice BLANCHEFLOUR AND JELLYFLORICE Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 125; Motherwell's MS., p. 588. 1 There was a maid, richly arrayd, In robes were rare to see, For seven years and something mair She servd a gay ladie. 2 But being fond o a higher place, In service she thought lang; She took her mantle her about, Her coffer by the band. 3 And as she walkd by the shore-side, As blythe's a bird on tree, Yet still she gaz'd her round about, To see what she could see. 4 At last she spied a little castle, That stood near by the sea; She spied it far and drew it near, To that castle went she. 5 And when she came to that castle She tirled at the pin, And ready stood a little wee boy To lat this fair maid in. 6 ‘O who's the owner of this place, O porter-boy, tell me;’ ‘This place belongs unto a queen O birth and high degree.’ 7 She put her hand in her pocket, And gae him shillings three: ‘O porter, bear my message well Unto the queen frae me.’ 8 The porter's gane before the queen, Fell low down on his knee: ‘Win up, win up, my porter-boy, What makes this courtesie?’ 9 ‘I hae been porter at your yetts, My dame, these years full three, But see a ladie at your yetts The fairest my eyes did see.’ 10 ‘Cast up my yetts baith wide and braid, Lat her come in to me, And I'll know by her courtesie Lord's daughter if she be.’ 11 When she came in before the queen, Fell low down on her knee: ‘Service frae you, my dame the queen, I pray you grant it me.’ 12 ‘If that service ye now do want, What station will ye be? Can ye card wool, or spin, fair maid, Or milk the cows to me?’ 13 ‘No, I can neither card nor spin, Nor cows I canno milk, But sit into a lady's bower And sew the seams o silk.’ 14 ‘What is your name, ye comely dame? Pray tell this unto me:’ ‘O Blancheflour, that is my name, Born in a strange countrie.’ 15 ‘O keep ye well frae Jellyflorice — My ain dear son is he — When other ladies get a gift, O that ye shall get three.’ 16 It wasna tald into the bower Till it went thro the ha, That Jellyflorice and Blancheflour Were grown ower great witha. 17 When the queen's maids their visits paid, Upo the gude Yule-day, When other ladies got horse to ride, She boud take foot and gae. 18 The queen she calld her stable-groom, To come to her right seen; Says, Ye'll take out yon wild waith steed And bring him to the green. 19 ‘Ye'll take the bridle frae his head, The lighters frae his een; Ere she ride three times roun the cross, Her weel-days will be dune.” 20 Jellyflorice his true-love spy'd As she rade roun the cross, And thrice he kissd her lovely lips, And took her frae her horse. 21 ‘Gang to your bower, my lily-flower, For a' my mother's spite; There's nae other amang her maids, In whom I take delight. 22 ‘Ye are my jewel, and only ane, Nane's do you injury; For ere this-day-month come and gang My wedded wife ye'se be.’ 301 THE QUEEN OF SCOTLAND The Queen of Scotland Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 46; Motherwell's MS., p. 577. 1 ‘O Troy Muir, my lily-flower, An asking I'll ask thee; Will ye come to my bigley bower And drink the wine wi me?’ 2 ‘My dame, this is too much honour You have conferrd on me; I'm sure it's mair than I've deservd Frae sic a one as thee.’ 3 ‘In Reekie's towers I hae a bower, And pictures round it set; There is a bed that is well made, Where you and I shall sleep.’ 4 ‘O God forbid,’ this youth then said, ‘That ever I drie sic blame As ever to touch the queen's bodie, Altho the king's frae hame.’ 5 When that he had these words spoken, She secretly did say, Some evil I shall work this man, Before that it be day. 6 Whan a' her maids were gane to bed, And knights were gane frae hame, She calld upon young Troy Muir, To put fire in her room. 7 ‘An asking, asking, Troy Muir, An asking ye'll grant me;’ ‘O, if it be a lawful thing, My dame it's granted be.’ 8 ‘There is a stane in yon garden, Nae ane lifts it for me; But if that ye woud lift the same, A brave man I'll ca thee. 9 ‘Under yon stane there is a pit, Most dreary for to see, And in it there's as much red gowd As buy a dukedom to thee.’ 10 ‘O if I had ae sleep in bed, And saw the morning sun, As soon's I rise and see the skies, Your will it shall be done.’ 11 When birds did sing, and sun did rise, And sweetly sang the lark, Troy Muir to the garden went, To work this dreary wark. 12 He's taen the stane then by a ring, And lifted manfullie; A serpent that lang wanted meat Round Troy Muir's middle did flee. 13 ‘How shall I get rid o this foul beast? It's by it I must dee; I never thought the queen, my friend, Woud work this mischief to me.’ 14 But by there came a weelfaird may, As Troy Muir did tauk, The serpent's furious rage to lay, Cut aff her fair white pap. 15 As soon as she the same had done, Young Troy Muir was set free, And in ane hour the wound was heald, That nae mair pain had she. 16 Says Troy Muir, My lily-flower, Ye hae releasëd me; But before I see another day, My wedded wife ye'se be. 17 He married her on that same day, Brought her to his ain hame; A lovely son to him she bare, When full nine months were gane. 18 As heaven was pleasd, in a short time, To ease her first sad pain, Sae was it pleasd, when she'd a son, To hae a pap again. 302 YOUNG BEARWELL Young Bearwell Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 75; Motherwell's MS., p. 456, derived from Buchan; Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 345. 1 When two lovers love each other well, Great sin it were them to twinn; And this I speak from Young Bearwell; He loved a lady young, The Mayor's daughter of Birktoun-brae, That lovely, leesome thing. 2 One day when she was looking out, When washing her milk-white hands, That she beheld him Young Bearwell, As he came in the sands. 3 Says, Wae's me for you, Young Bearwell, Such tales of you are tauld; They'll cause you sail the salt sea so far As beyond Yorkisfauld. 4 ‘O shall I bide in good greenwood, Or stay in bower with thee?’ 5 ‘The leaves are thick in good greenwood, Would hold you from the rain; And if you stay in bower with me You will be taken and slain. 6 ‘But I caused build a ship for you Upon Saint Innocent's day; I'll bid Saint Innocent be your guide, And Our Lady, that meikle may. You are a lady's first true-love, God carry you well away!’ 7 Then he sailed east, and he sailed west, By many a comely strand; At length a puff of northern wind Did blow him to the land. 8 When he did see the king and court, Were playing at the ba; Gave him a harp into his hand, Says, Stay, Bearwell, and play. 9 He had not been in the king's court A twelvemonth and a day, Till there came lairds and lords anew To court that lady gay. 10 They wooed her with brooch and ring, They nothing could keep back; The very charters of their lands Into her hands they pat. 11 She's done her down to Heyvalin, With the light of the moon; Says, Will ye do this deed for me, And will ye do it soon? 12 ‘Will ye go seek him Young Bearwell, On seas wherever he be? And if I live and bruik my life Rewarded ye shall be.’ 13 ‘Alas, I am too young a skipper, So far to sail the faem; But if I live and bruik my life I'll strive to bring him hame.’ 14 So he has saild east and then saild west, By many a comely strand, Till there came a blast of northern wind And blew him to the land. 15 And there the king and all his court Were playing at the ba; Gave him a harp into his hand, Says, Stay, Heyvalin, and play. 16 He has tane up the harp in hand, And unto play went he, And Young Bearwell was the first man In all that companie. 303 THE HOLY NUNNERY The Holy Nunnery Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 193. 1 Fair Annie had a costly bower, Well built wi lime and stane, And Willie came to visit her, Wi the light o the meen. 2 When he came to Annie's bower-door, He tirled at the pin: ‘Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Fair Annie, Ye'll open, lat me come in.’ 3 ‘O never a fit,’ says Fair Annie, ‘Till I your errand ken;’ ‘My father's vowd a vow, Annie, I'll tell you when I'm in. 4 ‘My father's vowed a rash vow, I darena marry thee; My mither's vowed anither vow, My bride ye'se never be.’ 5 ‘If ye had tauld me that, Willie, When we began to woo, There was naithing in this warld wide Shoud drawn my love to you. 6 ‘A nun, a nun,’ said Fair Annie, ‘A nun will I be then;’ ‘A priest, a priest,’ said Sweet Willie, ‘A priest will I be syne.’ 7 She is gane to her father, For mither she had nane; And she is on to her father, To see if she'd be a nun. 8 ‘An asking, asking, father dear, An asking ye'll grant me; That's to get to the holy nunnery, And there to live or die.’ 9 ‘Your asking's nae sae great, daughter, But granted it shall be; For ye'se won to the holy nunnery, There to live or die.’ 10 Then they gaed on, and farther on, Till they came to the yate; And there they spied a maiden porter, Wi gowd upon her hat. 11 ‘An asking, asking, maiden porter, An asking ye'll grant me; If I'll won to the holy nunnery, There to live or die.’ 12 ‘Your asking's nae sae great, lady, But granted it shall be; For ye'se won to the holy nunnery, There to live or die. 13 ‘But ye maun vow a vow, lady, Before that ye seek in; Never to kiss a young man's mouth That goes upon the grun. 14 ‘And ye must vow anither vow, Severely ye must work; The well-warst vow that ye're to vow, Is never to gang to kirk.’ 15 ‘I will vow a vow,’ she said, ‘Before that I seek in; I neer shall kiss a young man's mouth That goes upon the grun. 16 ‘And I will vow anither vow, Severely I will work; The well-warst vow that I'm to vow Is never to gang to kirk.’ 17 For seven years now Fair Annie, In the holy nunnery lay she, And seven years Sweet Willie lay, In languish like to die. 18 ‘Is there nae duke nor lord's daughter, My son, can comfort thee, And save thee frae the gates o death? Is there nae remedie?’ 19 ‘There is nae duke nor lord's daughter, Mother, can comfort me, Except it be my love, Annie, In the holy nunnery lies she.’ 20 They've dressd Sweet Willie up in silk, Wi gowd his gown did shine, And nane coud ken by his pale face But he was a lady fine. 21 So they gaed on, and farther on, Till they came to the yate, And there they spied a maiden porter, Wi gowd upon her hat. 22 ‘An asking, an asking, maiden porter, An asking ye'll grant me; For to win in to the holy nunnery, Fair Annie for to see.’ 23 ‘Your asking's nae sae great, lady, But granted it shall be; Ye'se won into the holy nunnery, Fair Annie for to see. 24 ‘Be she duke's or lord's daughter, It's lang sin she came here:’ Fair Annie kent her true love's face; Says, Come up, my sister dear. 25 Sweet Willie went to kiss her lips, As he had wont to do; But she softly whispered him, I darena this avow. 304 YOUNG RONALD YOUNG RONALD Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 282; Motherwell's MS., p. 601, derived from Buchan. 1 It fell upon the Lammas time, When flowers were fresh and green, And craig and cleugh was covered ower With cloathing that was clean. 2 'Twas at that time a noble squire, Sprung from an ancient line, Laid his love on a lady fair, The king's daughter o Linne. 3 When cocks did craw, and day did daw, And mint in meadows sprang, Young Ronald and his little wee boy They rode the way alang. 4 So they rode on, and farther on, To yonder pleasant green, And there he spied that lady fair, In her garden alane. 5 These two together lang they stood, And love's tale there they taul; The glancing o her fair color Did Ronald's own impale. 6 He lifted's hat, and thus he spake; O pity have on me! For I could pledge what is my right, All for the sake of thee. 7 ‘Ye're young amo your mirth, kind sir, And fair o your dull hours; There's nae a lady in a' London But might be your paramour. 8 ‘But I'm too young to wed, kind sir, You must not take it ill; Whate'er my father bids me do, I maun be at his will.’ 9 He kissd her then and took his leave, His heart was all in pride, And he is on to Windsor gone, And his boy by his side. 10 And when he unto Windsor came, And lighted on the green, There he spied his mother dear, Was walking there alane. 11 ‘Where have ye been, my son, Ronald, From gude school-house, this day?’ ‘I hae been at Linne, mother, Seeing yon bonny may.’ 12 ‘O wae's me for you now, Ronald, For she will not you hae; For mony a knight and bauld baron She's nickd them a' wi nae.’ 13 Young Ronald's done him to his bower, And he took bed and lay; Nae woman could come in his sight, For the thoughts o this well-fard may. 14 Then in it came his father dear, Well belted in a brand; The tears ran frae his twa gray eyes, All for his lovely son. 15 Then Ronald calld his stable-groom To come right speedilie; Says, Ye'll gang to yon stable, boy, And saddle a steed for me. 16 ‘His saddle o the guid red gowd, His bits be o the steel, His bridle o a glittering hue; See that ye saddle him weel. 17 ‘For I've heard greeters at your school-house, Near thirty in a day; But for to hear an auld man greet, It passes bairns' play.’ 18 When cocks did craw, and day did daw, And mint in meadows sprang, Young Ronald and his little wee boy The way they rode alang. 19 So they rode on, and further on, To yonder pleasant green, And there they saw that lady fair, In her garden alane. 20 And twenty times before he ceasd He kissd her lips sae clear, And said, Dear lady, for your sake, I'll fight fell lang and sair. 21 ‘Full haste, nae speed, for me, kind sir,’ Replied the lady clear; ‘Far better bucklings ye maun bide Or ye gain my love by weir. 22 ‘King Honour is my father's name, The morn to war maun fare, And that's to fight a proud giant, That's wrought him muckle care. 23 ‘Along wi him he is to take Baith noble knights and squires; I woud wish you as well-dressd a knight As ony will be there. 24 ‘And I'll gie you a thousand crowns, To part amang your men; A robe upon your ain body, Weel sewd wi my ain hand. 25 ‘Likewise a ring, a royal thing, The virtue it is gude; If ony o your men be hurt, It soon will stem their blude. 26 ‘Another ring, a royal thing, Whose virtue is well known; As lang's this ring your body's on, Your bluid shall neer be drawn.’ 27 He kissd her then, and took his leave, His heart was all in pride, And he is on to Windsor gone, And his boy by his side. 28 And when he unto Windsor came, And lighted on the green, There he saw his auld father, Was walking him alane. 29 ‘Where hae ye been, my son, Ronald, From gude school-house the day?’ ‘O I hae been at Linne, father, Seeking yon bonny may.’ 30 ‘O wae's me for you now, Ronald, For she will not you hae; Mony a knight and bauld baron She's nickd them a' wi nay.’ 31 ‘O had your tongue, my father dear, Lat a' your folly be; The last words that I wi her spake, Her love was granted me. 32 ‘King Honour is her father's name, The morn to war maun fare, And that's to fight a proud giant, That's wrought him muckle care. 33 ‘Alang wi him he means to take Baith knights and noble squires; And she wishes me as well drest a knight As ony will be there. 34 ‘And she's gaen me a thousand crowns, To part amang my men; A robe upon my ain body, Weel sewd wi her ain hand. 35 ‘Likewise a ring, a royal thing, The virtue it is gude; If ony o my men be hurt, It soon will stem their blude. 36 ‘Another ring, a royal thing, Whose virtue is unknown; As lang's this ring my body's on, My blude will neer be drawn.’ 37 ‘If that be true, my son, Ronald, That ye hae tauld to me, I'll gie to you an hundred men, To bear you companie. 38 ‘Besides as muckle gude harness As carry them on the lee; It is a company gude enough For sic a squire as thee.’ 39 When cocks did craw, and day did daw, And mint in meadows spread, Young Ronald and his merry young men Were ready for to ride. 40 So they rode on, and farther on, To yonder pleasant green, And there they spied that lady fair, In her garden, sair mourning. 41 These twa together lang they stood, And love's tale there they taul, Till her father and his merry young men Had ridden seven mile. 42 He kissd her then, and took his leave, His heart was all in pride, And then he sprang alang the road As sparks do frae the gleed. 43 Then to his great steed he set spur; He being swift o feet, They soon arrived on the plain, Where all the rest did meet. 44 Then flew the foul thief frae the west, His make was never seen; He had three heads upon ae hause, Three heads on ae breast-bane. 45 He bauldly stept up to the king, Seiz'd's steed in his right hand; Says, Here I am, a valiant man, Fight me now if ye can. 46 ‘Where is the man in a' my train Will take this deed in hand? And he shall hae my daughter dear, And third part o my land.’ 47 ‘O here am I,’ said young Ronald, ‘Will take the deed in hand; And ye'll gie me your daughter dear, I'll seek nane o your land.’ 48 ‘I woudna for my life, Ronald, This day I left you here; Remember ye yon lady gay For you shed mony a tear.’ 49 Fan he did mind on that lady That he left him behind, He hadna mair fear to fight Nor a lion frae a chain. 50 Then he cut aff the giant's heads Wi ae sweep o his hand, Gaed hame and married that lady, And heird her father's land. 305 THE OUTLAW MURRAY The Sang of the Outlaw Murray; or, The Outlaw Murray; or, The Song of the Outlaw Murray THE OUTLAW MURRAY—A a.

In the fore front o that castell fair Twa unicorns are bra to see. 3 There's the picture of a knight and a ladye bright, And the grene hollin aboon their brie; There an Outlaw keepis five hundred men, He keepis a royalle companie. 4 His merrie men are in [ae] liverie clad, Of the Lincoln grene so fair to see; He and his ladie in purple clad, O if they live not royallie! 5 Word is gane to our nobell king, In Edinburgh where that he lay, That there was an Outlaw in Etterick forest Counted him nought and all his courtrie gay. 6 ‘I mak a vowe,’ then the goode king said, ‘Unto the man that dear bought me, I'se either be king of Etrick forest, Or king of Scotland that Outlaw's bee.’ 7 Then spak the erle hight Hamilton, And to the noble king said he; My sovereign prince, sum counsell tak, First of your nobles, syne of me. 8 ‘I redd you send yon bra Outlaw till And see gif your man cum will he; Desire him cum and be your man, And hald of you yon forest frie. 9 ‘And gif he refuses to do that, We'll conquess both his lands and he, Or else we'll throw his castell down, And mak a widowe of his gaye ladie.’ 10 The king called on a gentleman, James Boyd, Erle of Arran, his brother was he; When James he came before the king He fell before him on his knie. 11 ‘Welcum, James Boyd,’ said our nobil king, ‘A message ye maun gang for me; Ye maun hie to Etrick forrest, To yon Outlaw, where dwelleth he. 12 ‘Ask hym of quhom he haldis his lands, Or, man, wha may his master be; Desyre him come and be my man, And hald of me yon forrest frie. 13 ‘To Edinburgh to cum and gang His safe-warrand I sall be; And, gif he refuses to do that, We'll conquess baith his lands and he. 14 ‘Thou mayst vow I'll cast his castell doun, And mak a widow of his gay ladie; I'll hang his merrie men pair by pair In ony frith where I may them see.’ 15 James Boyd took his leave of the nobill king, To Etrick forrest fair came he; Down Birkendale brae when that he cam, He saw the fair forest with his ee. 16 Baith dae and rae and hart and hynd, And of all wylde beastis grete plentie; He heard the bows that bauldly ring, And arrows whidderand near him by. 17 Of the fair castell he got a sight, The like he nere saw with his ee; On the fore front of that castell Twa unicorns were bra to see. 18 The picture of a knight and a ladie bright, And the grene hollin aboon their brie; Thereat he spy'd five hundred men, Shuting with bows upon the lee. 19 They a' were in ae liverie clad, Of the Lincoln grene, sae fair to see; The knight and his ladye in purple clad; O gif they lived right royallie! Therefore he kend he was master-man, And served him in his ain degree. 20 ‘God mot thee save, brave Outlaw Murray, Thy ladie and a' thy chivalrie!’ ‘Marry, thou's wellcum, gentleman, Sum king's-messenger thou seems to be.’ 21 ‘The King of Scotland sent me hier, And, gude Outlaw, I'm sent to thee; I wad wat of whom ye hald your lands, Or, man, wha may thy master be.’ 22 ‘Thir landis are mine,’ the Outlaw said, ‘I own na king in Christentie; Frae Soudron I this forest wan, When the king nor's knights were not to see.’ 23 ‘He desires you'l come to Edinburgh, And hald of him this forest frie; And gif you refuse to do this, He'll conquess both thy landis and thee; He has vowd to cast thy castell down, And make a widow of thy gaye ladie. 24 ‘He'll hang thy merrie men pair by pair, In ony frith where he may them finde;’ ‘Aye, by my troth,’ the Outlaw said, ‘Then wad I think me far behinde. 25 ‘Eere the king my fair countrie get, This land that's nativest to me, Mony of his nobils sall be cauld, Their ladies sall be right wearie.’ 26 Then spak his ladye fair of face, She said, Without consent of me That an outlaw shuld come before the king: I am right rad of treasonrie. 27 ‘Bid him be gude to his lordis at hame, For Edinburgh my lord sall never see:’ James tuke his leave of the Outlaw keene, To Edinburgh boun is he. 28 And when he came before the king, He fell before him on his knie: ‘Wellcum, James Boyd,’ said the nobil king, ‘What foreste is Etrick forest frie?’ 29 ‘Etrick forest is the fairest forest That ever man saw with his ee; There's the dae, the rae, the hart, the hynde, And of all wild beastis great plentie. 30 ‘There's a prittie castell of lime and stone, O gif it stands not pleasauntlie! There's on the fore side of that castell Twa unicorns sae bra to see. 31 ‘There's the picture of a knight and [a] ladie bright, And the grene hollin aboon their brie; There the Outlaw keepis five hundred men, O gif they live not royallie! 32 ‘His merry men in [ae] liverie clad, O the Lincoln grene, so fair to see; He and his ladye in purple clad, O gif they live not royallie! 33 ‘He says yon forest is his ain, He wan it from the Soudronie; Sae as he won it, sae will he keep it, Contrair all kings in Christentie.’ 34 ‘Gar ray my horse,’ said the nobil king, ‘To Etrick [forest] hie will I me;’ Then he gard graith five thousand men, And sent them on for the forest frie. 35 Then word is gane the Outlaw till, In Etrick forest where dwelleth he, That the king was cumand to his cuntrie, To conquess baith his lands and he. 36 ‘I mak a vow,’ the Outlaw said, ‘I mak a vow, and that trulie, Were there but three men to tak my part, Yon king's cuming full deir suld be.’ 37 Then messengers he called forth, And bade them haste them speedilie: ‘Ane of you go to Halliday, The laird of the Corehead is he. 38 ‘He certain is my sister's son, Bid him cum quick and succour me; Tell Halliday with thee to cum, And shaw him a' the veritie.’ 39 ‘What news?

I'll mak the[e] shiryff of the forest, Surely while upwards grows the trie; If you be not traytour to the king, Forfaulted sall ye never be.’ 69 ‘But, prince, what sall cum o my men? When I go back, traitour they'll ca me; I had rather lose my life and land, Eer my merry men rebukëd me.’ 70 ‘Will your merry men amend their lives And all their pardouns I grant thee: Now name thy landes whe'ere they be, And here I render them to thee.’ 71 ‘Fair Philiphaugh, prince, is my awin, I biggit it wi lime and stane; The Tinnies and the Hangingshaw, My leige, are native steeds of mine. 72 ‘ I have mony steeds in the forest shaw, But them by name I dinna knaw.’ 73 The keys of the castell he gave the king, With the blessing of his fair ladye; He was made sheryff of Etrick forest, Surely while upward grows the trie; And, if he was not traytour to the king, Forfaulted he suld never be. 74 Wha ever heard, in ony tymes, Sicken an outlaw in his degree Sic favour get before a king As did the Outlaw Murray of the forest frie? An old song called Outlaw Murray THE OUTLAW MURRAY—B Glenriddell's MSS, XI, 61, 1791. 1 Etterick forest's a pleasant land, And it grows mony a bonny tree; With buck and doe and a' wild beast, A castle stands right bonnilie. 2 Yon castle has twa unicorns, The like I never saw wi my ee, The picture of a knight and lady bright, And the green hollin's aboon her [bree]. 3 Word is gane to Edinbro town That there's an Outlaw in Etterick forest That keeps as fine a court as he. 4 The king has sworn a solemn oath, And he has sworn by [the Virgin Mary], He would either be king of Etterick forest, Or king of Scotland the Outlaw should be. 5 He has ca'd up Mr James Boyd, A highland laird I'm sure was he: ‘Ye must gae to Etterick forest And see of wha he hads his land, And wha pays yon men meat and fee.’ 6 He's tane his leave o the king and court, Een as hard as he may dree; When he came in o'er Loudon edge, He viewed the forest wi his eee. 7 He thought it was as pleasant a land As ever his two eyes did see, But when he came in oer , They were a' ranked on Newark lee. 8 O waly, but they were bonny to see! Five hundred men playing at the ba; They were a' clad in the Lincoln green, And the Outlaw's sell in taffety. 9 ‘Weel met you save, Outlaw,’ he says, ‘You and your brave companie; The King of Scotland hath sent me here, To see whom on you hold your lands, Or who pays thir men meat and fee.’ 10 The first ae man the answer made, It was the Outlaw he: ‘The lands they are all mine, And I pay thir men meat and fee, And as I wan them so will I lose them, Contrair the kings o Cristendie. 11 ‘I never was a king's subject, And a king's subject I'll never be; For I wan them i the fields fighting, Where him and his nobles durst not come and see.’ 12 O out bespeaks the Outlaw's lady, I wot she spake right wisely; ‘Be good unto your nobles at home, For Edinbro mine shall never see;’ But meat and drink o the best I'm sure got he. 13 He has taen his leave o the Outlaw free, And een as hard as he may dree, While he came to the king's court, Where he kneeld low down on his knee. 14 ‘What news? what news, James,’ he says, ‘Frae yon Outlaw and his company?’ ‘Yon forest is as fine a land As ever I did see. 15 ‘Yon Outlaw keeps as fine a court As any king in Cristendie; Yon lands they are here all his own, And he pays yon men meat and fee, And as he wan them so will he lose them, Contrair the kings of Cristendie. 16 ‘He never was a king's subject, And a king's subject he'll never be; For he wan them in the fields fighting, Where the king and his nobles durst not come to see.’ 17 The king has sworn a solemn oath, And he has sworn by the Virgin Mary, He would either be king of Etterick forest, Or king of Scotland the Outlaw should be. 18 The king has ca'd up Mr James Pringle, Laird of Torson[s]e at the time was he: ‘Ye must gae to Etterick forest, And see wha of he hads his land, And wha pays yon men meat and fee.’ 19-25=6-12. 26 ‘And as I wan them so will I lose them, Contrair the kings o Cristendie; I wan them frae the Soudan Turk, When their cuckold king durst not come to see; For I wan them in the fields fighting, Where him and his nobles durst not come to see.’ 27-32=12-17. 33 ‘Gar warn me Perthshire and Angus both, Fifeshire up and down, and Loudons three, For I fear of them we hae great need, ’ 34 Then word is come to the Outlaw then, ‘Our noble king comes on the morn, Landless men ye will a' be;’ He's called up his little foot-page, His sister's son I trow was he. 35 ‘Ye must tak Etterick head Een as hard as ye can drie; Ye must gae to the Corhead and tell Andrew Brown this frae me. 36 ‘The noble king comes in the morn, And landless men we will a' be; And tell him to send me some supply.’ 37 The boy has taen Etterick head, And een as hard as he may drie, Till he came to the Corhead, And he shouted out and cry'd well he. 38 ‘What news? what news, my little boy? What news has thy master to me?’ ‘The noble king comes in the morn, And landless then ye will a' be. 39 ‘Ye must meet him on the morn, And mak him some supply;’ ‘For if he get the forest fair frae him, He'll hae Moffat-dale frae me. 40 ‘I'll meet him the morn wi five hundred men, And fifty mair, if they may be; And if he get the forest fair We'll a' die on the Newark lee.’ 41 Word is gane to the Border then, To , the country-keeper I'm sure was he: ‘The noble king comes in the morn, And landless men ye will a' be.’ 42 ‘I'll meet him the morn wi five hundred men, And fifty mair, if they may be; And if he get the forest fair, We'll a' die on the Newark lee.’ 43 Word is gane to Philiphaugh, His sister's son I'm sure was he, To meet him the morn wi some supply, ‘For the noble king comes in the morn, And landless men ye will a' be.’ 44 ‘In the day I daur not be seen, For he took a' my lands frae me And gifted me them back again; Therefore against him I must not be; For if I be found against him rebel, It will be counted great treason[rie]. 45 ‘In the day I daur not be seen, But in the night he shall me find With five hundred men and fifty, if they may be, And before he get the forest fair We'll a' die on the Newark lee.’ 46 When the king came in oer Loudon edge, Wi three thousand weel teld was he, And when he came in oer He viewd that forest wi his ee. 47 The Outlaw and his men were a' Ranked on the Newark lee; They were a' clad in the Lincoln green, And he himsell in the taffety. 48 An auld grey-haird knight has taen aff his cap, ‘Pardon, pardon, my sovereign liege, Two or three words to speak wi you. 49 ‘If you please to send for the Outlaw, To see if he could with you agree, There's not a man yon Outlaw has But of yours he'll choose to be.’ 50 The king he has taen af his cap, He held it on his majesty; ‘I'll meet him the morn at the poor man's house, In number not above two or three;’ The Outlaw says, I'll hae as few as thee. 51 ‘There's Andrew Brown, and Andrew Murray, And Mess James Murray shall gang wi me, And nae mae shall my number be.’ 52 And when they came to the poor man's core They waited two lang hours or three, And they were aware of the noble king coming, And hundreds three in his company. 53 ‘I wonder what the muckle Deel He'll learned kings to lie, For to fetch me here frae amang my men Even like a dog for to die; But before I gang to Edinbro town Monny toom saddles shall there be.’ 54 The king he has taen aff his cap; ‘It [were] great offence here,’ he says, ‘And great pity to see thee die. 55 ‘For thou shalt be laerd o this forest fair As lang as upwards grows the tree And downward the twa rivers run, If the steads thou can but rightly name to me.’ 56 ‘There's Hangingshaw high and Hangingshaw laigh, The Tinis and the Tinis-burn, The Newark and the Newark lee.’ Outlaw Murray, an antient historical ballad THE OUTLAW MURRAY—C “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,” No 31, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of William Laidlaw. 1 ‘Gae fetch to me James Pringle wi hast, An see that he come speedilie, For he maun on to Ettrick forest, An see whae pays yon men meat and fee.’ 2 When James Pringle cam down oer Birkendalee, The hawks war yellin right loudlie, The hunds war rinnin oer hill and dale, As the bugle-horn soundit bonnilie. 3 ‘Gae tell yer king this land's my ain, An to thir men I pay meat and fee; I took it thrae the Souden Turk, When nae sic cuckold king might be. 4 ‘Sae as I wan, sae will I lose, Spite o the kings in Christendie; I never was a king's subject, Nor a king's subject will I ever be.’ 5 ‘Outlaw Murray says yon land's his ain, And to yon men he pays meat and fee; He took it frae the Souden Turk, When you and your men durstna come and see.’ 6 It was than the king he gat up in hast, An wow an angrie man was he! ‘I'se either be king o Ettrick forest, Or king o Scotland sal he be. 7 ‘Gar warn me Fife an a' Lothian land, An Perth an Angus, to ride wi me, For gin we war five thousan strang Master and mair I fear he'll be.’ 8 When the king came oer be Birkendalee, He spy'd the forest wi his ee; There war daes an raes an monie wild beast, An a castle stannin right bonnilie. 9 An in that castle a unicorn, An, waly, but they war fair to see! A warlike knight and a lady bright, An the green halleen aboon her bree. 10 An Outlaw Murray an his merry men War a' rankit up i the Newark lee, Well mountit on a milk-white steed; Waly, he rankit them bonnilie! 11 His men war a clad oer wi green, An he was clad i the taffatie, Wi belt an pistle by his side; O waly, but they war fair to see! 12 ‘Haliday young an Halliday auld, Ye ir the men that man ride wi me; But gin we war five hunder strang Master an mair I fear they'll be.’ 13 ‘Philliphaugh it is my ain, An Newark it belangs to me; Lewinshope an Hanginshaw Nae mortal man can claim thrae me.’ 14 It was than James Boyd got up in hast, An to his merry men a' spak he;</field>
